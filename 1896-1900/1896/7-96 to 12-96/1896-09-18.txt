' CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 17 âA large and
enthusiastic delegation composed of the
employes of the Ed?ar Thompson Steel
"Works of Braddock, Pa., arrived on three
special trains over the Pennsylvania Rail
road shortly after noon to-day. The visit
ors were accompanied by the Sheridan Sa
ber and St. Thomas bands. There were
fully 3500 persons in the party.
At the depot the visitors w*s met by the
Canton Mounted Troop and a large crowd
of citizens. "When the last of the three
trains had pnlled into the station the line
was formed and the delegation marched
to the retidence of Major McKmiey. The
spokesman of the party was John L.
Jones. He made a brief speech to the
candidate, ;n which he praised the proiec
tive principles of the Republican party and
declared that his people were solidly for
sound money.
Major McKinley bad been received with
a storm of cheering when he appeared on
the porch. This applause was renewed
when the spokesman had finished his in
troductory remarks and the nominee had
mounted a chair to respond. Major Mc-
Kinley said:
. Mr. Jones and my fellow-citizens: Many del
egations have waited upon me in the last two
months. All have been welcome and their
visits have been inspiring, but somehow when
an assemblage of worJri nginen come to pay me
a visit it attracts my Interest and touches kit
heart. [Cheers.] I bid you welcome to my
city and to my home. I can well appreciate
why the workingmen of this country should
have a deep and. profound interest Id the out
come of the present National contest. [Cries
of "We have."] We cannot fail to remember
that the one thing which stands between your
labor and the labor of Europe â the only thing
which stands between your workshops and the
workshops of the Old Worldâ a wise, patri
otic American protective policy. [Great cheer
ing and cries of "Eight you are."]
I am very glad to have this large delegation
of the employes of the great Edgar Thomson
Bteel Works of Braddock, Pa., at, my home.
[Applause and cries of "We are glad to be
here."] You have come, us your spokesman
has stated, to bring me your goodwill and
that of your fellow-citizens, whom you repre
sent, lam glad to have you to come in the
manner your spokesman has described â repre
senting all creeds, all colors and all classes;
men who belong to the Republican' party and
those who have heretofore belonged to other
parties, now acting together for what they be
lieve to be the common good. [Applause.]
This is distinctively the people's year, when
old lines are effaced and men heretofore op.
posed meet upon a common platform to sus
tain the honor of the country. [Applause.]
Parties are only agents of tbe people. They
are only what the people make them, and en
titled to their confidence only so long as they
serve their highest and best interests, [Ap
plause and cries of "That's right."] We are
all concerned, no matter what may be our oc
cupations, in our country's welfare. [Cries of
"Trial's so."] Whatever political views we
may have, however we may differ on minor
questions of public policy, we are all of one
mind in the conviction that something i& the
matter with the country. We may differ in
our diagnosis; we may differ about the treat
ment in detail, but we do not disagree upon
what is essential in the first instance to the
restoration of the better conditions of the
past. One thing above all else that is wanted
at this juncture is the return of public and
private confidence. [Applause and cries of
"Correct"
Its absence is our fundamental trouble.
Upon that there cannot be two opinions, and
that, my fellow-citizens, no class of people
know better than you. We know the very
day and the hour when thin confidence was
first shaken, and from that hour distrust and
doubt have hung over the business of the
country. It has been aggravated from a
variety of causes, but none greater than the
assault which has been made by the allied
political organizations upon the credit and
the currency of the country. [Applause and
cries of "That* right."]
This new menace must be averted before we
can hope to have any permanent prosperity.
We know that the present money standard has
not stood in the way of our prosperity in the
past. [Cries ot No, no; free trade has."] You
know that we were prosperous In 1892 and
tad been for the preceding ten years. You
know that we have not seen any real measure
of prosperity since. [Applause and cries of
"that's right."]
Business is so sensitive, so quick to scent
danger, that any legislation or proposed
legislation or change of policy which would
derange or alter or unsettle values is felt long
be tore ibe apprehended blow is given. So
that from the very hour it was determined by
the American people that the Republican
party, which with but a single interruption
had been in control of the Government for
more than thirty years, was to go out of power
and another party with a different policy was
to come in that moment every business of the
country assumed an attitude of waiting and
of fear and anxiety. [Applause] While busi
ness men were waiting to know exactly what
legislation was to be business was languishing
from oue end to the other and labor was with
out work. Then we commenced living from
hÂ«nd to mouth, and we have been living from
hand to mouth ever since. [Great applause
aud cries of "We have."]
As an old comrade said to me a few dnys ago,
"The distance seems to be getting greater with
erch succeeding year." [Laughter and ap
plause.] According to a census rccenty taken
by a newspaper in New York it appears that
in July, 1892,587 employers of labor in ihe
United States gave work to 114,231 bands.
How was it in July, 1896? [Cries of "Not so
good."] The same emp overs gave wo;k to 78,
-700 uands; 35,531 men -Fho had been em
ployed In 1892 were thrown out of employ
The San Francisco Call.
ment in 1896 and put in a stale of idleness,
resulting in a loss of more than 30 pÂ»r cent to
labor. In July, 1892, .he wages paid to the
114,231 hands amounted to $3,927,000. In
July, 1896, the earning* of the 78,000 hands
amounted to only $2,469,712, a loss to labor
in v single month in those establishments of
$1,457,000, or 40 per cent. [A voiceâ"Penn
sylvania knows if] \es, and Pennsylvania,
like- all the rest of the country, will vote this
year *.vith that knowledge. [Cries of "Right,
right."] In 1892 the monthly average of
wages paid in these establishments was
$34 50, iv 1896 only $31.
My country men, I am one of th<|se Ameri
cans who believe that the American workshop
should be protected as iar as possible from the
foreign workshop, to the end thai American
workingmen may be constantly employed and
so protected, too, as to be employed at Ameri
can wages. [Tremendous cheering and cries
of "What's the matter with Mi-Kin ley? He's
all right."] Nor do I want products cheapened
at the expense of American manhood. [Ap
plause.] Nor do I think that it is economy to
buy goods cheaply abroad if thereby it en
force-- idleness at home. [Renewed applause.]
Such goods are the dearest that the American
people can buy. [Cries of "Eight you are,
Major.'*] James G. Blalne [applause], that
gifted statesman, in 1884 spoke words of wis
dom which seem singularly applicable to our
present situation and to the pre.-ent hour. He
said: "A policy that would Hbandon the fieid
of home trade must prove disastrous to the
mechanics and workingmen of the United
States. Wages are unjustly reduced when an
industrious man is not able by hit earnings to
live in comfort, educate his children and save
a sufficient amount for tbe necessities of age.
The reduction of waxes inevitably conse
quent upon throwing our home market open
to the world would deprive the workinÂ«;iuen
of the United States of the power to do this.
It would prove a great calamity to our coun
try. It would produce a conflict between the
poor and the rich, and in the sorrowful degra
dation of labor would plant the seeds of pub
lic danger. The Republican party has steadily
aimed to maintain just relations between capi
tal and laborâ guarding with care the rights
oi erch. A conflict between the two has al
ways led in the past and will always lead in
the future to the injury of both. [Applause.]
Labor is indispensable to the creation and
profitable use of capital, and capital increases
tbe efficiency and value of labor. Whoever
arrays the one against the other is an euemy
of both. [Applause.] This policy is wisest and
ben which harmonizes tbe two on the basis of
absolute justice. The Republican party has
protected the free labor of America so that its
compensation is larger than it realized in any
other country. [Great applause and cries of
â¢'Hurrah for McKinley."]
But, my countrymen, as if the business con
ditions were not bad enough and hard enough
to bear, we have thrust upon us at this most
critical time in tbe business affairs of the
Kiit. on a proposition to debase the currency of
the country, and to undermine the public
credit. We know what partial free trade has
done for the labor of the United States. It has
diminished its employment and earnings. We
do not propose now to inaugurate a currency
system that will cheat labor in its pay. The
laboring men of this couu try, whenever they
give one d y's work to their employer, want to
be paid in full dollars, good everywhere in the
world. [Great cheering and cries of "McKin
ley's all riisht" ] We want in this country
good work, good wages and good money. [Ap
plause.] We want to continue our good Gov
ernment with its generous privileges and
matchless opportunities, and want it to be a
government where law is supreme all over
[cheers], and for the equal benefit of aIL [Re
newed cheering.]
My fellow-citizen*, It If gratifying to me to
be assured by your spokesman and my old
comradeâ it will be inspiring to the whole
country â that the voice of labor here to-day
declares that no party which degrades the
honor of the Nation, no party which stands
opposed to law and order, or which setks to
array the masses against the classes, shall
receive its vote and support. [Great cheering
and cries of "That's right."]
Golden words are these which will strike a
chord of sympathy in every American home
where virtue dwells and truth abides. [Ap
plause.] We have this year resting upon us as
citizens a grave responsibility. The country
hab never failed or faltered in the past to meet
every crisis. It will not faiter or fail now to
uphole the dignity and independence of labor
and the honor and stability of the Govern
-1 ment that it may still further exalt the
American name. [Applause.]
I thank you over and over again for this call
and for the patriotic sentiments which have
been so eloquently express ed by your spokes
man. To have the hearty support of the work
ingm'-n is- indeed an honor for which I thank
you in the name of the cause which I repre
sent, and is only another evidence of the
wisdom and strength of free government.
May God bring to you and to your homes cheer
and contentment. [Great applause.]
Major McKinley 's mail was exception
ally neavy this morning. Besides the
usual large number of letters containing
expressions of best wishes, assurance of
support and congratulations upon the
Maine victory there were advices from nu
merous political organizations, clubs and
individuals throughout this and adjoin
ing States of their intention to participate
in the big demonstration to be held in this
city to-morrow.
Should the weather prove favorable it is
expected that the opening of the campaign
in Stark County to-morrow will be the
greatest political gathering in the history
of the Btate. The railroads centering in
Canton have arranged for the reception of
fifty special trains of excursionists which
will come from all directions.

Twin State Convention* fmU to Beach
an Agreement.
COLUMBIA, 8. C, Sept. 17.â The twin
State conventions, representing two fac
tions of the Republican party in this
State, the Melton faction, known as the
Union Reorganized Republican party, and
the old-line Republicans, which was
recognized by the National Convention,
met to-day in the State House. The Mel
ton meeting was caLed together at noon
by State Chairman Mellon.
Mr. Duncan of Newberry introduced a
resolution looking to the appointment oi
a committee on conference, and it wa^
aureeJ to.
Tbe "regular" faction met at 2 p. m.,
with E. A. Webster presiding. In bia
opening speech Mr. Web-ter indicated an
opposition io compromise with the Mel
tonites. T. J. Dickerson was elected

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 18, 1896.
William J. Bryan has been "talking for Buncombe." For weeks he has poured into the ears of the people of
the country, from Nebraska to the sounding sea, a torrent of talk that his political opponents have often designated
as "buncombe," and at last he is convicted â caught in the act. To-day he imitated the Congressman of long ago,
who, rising to address the House, and having no extraordinary powers of manner or matter, drove most of his audi
ence from the building, then naively told those remaining that they might go, too, as he was only "talking for
Buncombe." Asheville is the capital of Buncombe County and for it Mr. Bryan talked to-day. â Press Dispatch
from Asheville, Buncombe County, N. C.
veution he was received. Smith at
tempted to make a speech, but was shut
off, being told to read the document He
persisted in speaking, and being "called
down," retired without his paper of peace.
Tbe regulars were enraged at this. The
convention then proceeded to appoint
committees, and adjourned until 8
o'clock p. k.
On Smith's return to the Meltonites he
recommended that another attempt be
made. A committee of seven was there
upon appointed. After recess the first
thing done was the passage of resolutions
of resolutions of sympathy for Cuba. The
conference committee bore to tbe other
body an apology for Smith's action and a
proposition that they join issues in the
coming fight. In the interim the plat
form was read. It indorses the St. Louis
plattorm.
A full State ticket of white men with
Sampson Pope at the head was nominated.
The regulars here sent in a communica
tion saying it was out of their power to
interfere with nominations to be made by
Congressional conventions, and that a
committee from their convention tad
already been appointed to select Presi
dential electors, which would confer with
a proper committee from this convention.
The lily whites sent an answer to the
regulars that, as it was evident they did
not wish to act with them for the better
ment of the Republican party, the negotia
tions to that end might be considered at
an end. This action was received with
cheera. A fail electoral ticket was nomi
nated.
George W. Murray read the act of Con
gress which provided the means whereby
the several Southern States had their re
presentation in Congress restored to them.
By the terms of this act he claimed no
United States court, without nullifying
the act, could do otherwise than declare the
South Carolina constitution void. He sug
gested that they apply to some United
States Circuit Judge for a writ of man
damus to compel the registration of the
negro voters of the State. As a starter for
the fund he gave his check for $100. The
executive committee was instructed to
push the matter with the least possible de
lay.
At the evening session of the regulars
the platform was read; then a State ticket
was nominated. R. M. Wallace of Bumter
is the gubernatorial candidate.

the trouble is passed upon at a formal con

Tbe Kerens faction has proposed that
Mr. Lelsnd establish headquarters for the
National Committee in Kansas City and
conduct the rest of the campaign in Mis

The delegation which hurried here in tbe
interests of Mr. Filley as soon as it was
known that the Kerens delegation had
seen Mr. fianna was composed of Charles
Parson, banker; Alderman Charles Na

orously protested to Mr. Hanna that the
Missouri campaign was being conducted
satisfactorily and said pome uncompli
mentary things about the complaining
delegation.
Mr. Hanna declined to discuss tbe situ
ation except to say that a way would be
found for both factions to work harmoni
ously for tbe success of the ticket.

has accepted.
Senator Cullom, who is to be one of the
speakers at the Canton rally to-morrow,
arrived at headquarters from the Egypt
section of Illinois, where he has been
making numerous speeches. He said his
observations convinced him Illinois would
give McKinley a tremendous majority.
He admitted the fusion of the Populists
and Democrats in many Southern Illinois
counties would keep the .Democratic vote
to its normal size, but with voters of the
old parties there was strict adherence to
party lines. The Senator will go to Ken
tucky for three speeches after leaving
Canton.
Committeemen and others at headquar
ters were greatly disappointed to iearn
that Benjamin Harrison had declined to
make any speaking engagements for the
present. It is known that his law court
engagements and magazine work will
keep him busy until October 1, but as the
ex-Presideni has not said be would make
no more speeches during the campaign it

friends within the patty to deliver sev

BRITONS FAVOR THE SCHEME.
Two American Warships Are Now
on Their Way to Force the
Dardanelles.
LONDON, Enq., Sept. 17. â The St.
James Gazette to-day publishes s special
dispatch from Washington in which it is
asserted that the United States will help
England in any operations undertaken in
Turkish waters fur the protection of Chris
tians.
According to the dispatch President
Cleveland has determined definitely that
the United States ship Bancroft, now on
her way to the Mediterranean, shall enter
the Bo phorus with or without the per
mission of the Sultan, and shall make her
way to Constantinople even if fore* be
necessary.
Tite American Government, the dis
patch says, has been fully informed of the
plans of Lord Salisbury, and is prepared
toco-operate in them. Ibese plans pro
vide t at the British fleet shall force the
passage of the Dardanelles and shall do
the actual fighting. The American ships
will not engage the Turkish forts, but will
follow behind the British ii?et and will
preserve order.
Several of the leading provincial papers,
mc uding the Leeds Mercury (Liberal) and
the Yorkshire Post (Conservative) concur
in tiie View that a joint action Oi the Brit
ish and American warshins at Constanii
nop eto overawe t c Sultan an -i compel
him to extend protection to Christians
would be a magnificent and effective co
operation.
WASHINGTON, D. <\, Bept 17.â The
story published iv the English papers to
day stating that the American Govern
ment had decided to co-operate with
England in the operations in Turkey is
doubted here. It is thought that it origi
nated from tbe fact that tbe Bancroft and
Cincinnati were both ordered to Turkish
waters.
Prominent officials state that if Eng
land should begin warlike operations
against Turkey the Americans vessels
would undoubtedly co-operate in the way
of saving tbe lives of Christians and pre
venting massacres as far as possible; but
they do not believe that any definite
agreement of co-operation has been en
tered into. They believe that the dis
patching of the Bancroft and Cincinnati
was a purely independent move on the
part of tliis Government.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 17.â The
United States cruiser Cincinnati passed
out at Quarantine at 3:40 p. >t. to-day,
bound for the Bosphorus. She is expected
to overtake and consort the Bancroft,
which left a few days ago for the same
destination.

in that city from Constantinople states
that the troops on duty at tbe Yildez

Tne Minister of War was summoned
to restore discipline. He tooK with him
the military cadets and two detachments
of trusty soldiers. When the Minister
arrived at the s-cene ho ordered the muti
neers to lay down their arms. This they
refused to do, and a fight resulted when
the Minister attempted to enforce his
orders.
The fighting lasted for half an hour, at
the end of which time the Minister forced
his way into the palace. According to the
dispatch over 300 of the combatants were
Killed. Attempts to confirm the foregoing
report have been without result.

BUFFALO, N. V., Sept. 17.â 1n one
sweeping sentence the Democracy of the
State of New York to-day indorsed the
Chicago platform and the nominations of
W. J. Bryan and Artnur Sewali. The State
ticket nominated is:
For Governorâ John Boyd Thacher of
Albany. <
For Lieutenant-Governor â "Wilbur F.
Po ter of Jefferson.
For Judge of the Court of Appeals â
Robert C. Titus of Erie.
Electors at largeâ Robert H. Bu-sh of
Horsehead and Benjamin Wood of New
York.
Tbe convention completed its work in
one short session, which was not altogether
harmonious, but which resulted in a vic
tory for the regular organization and the
selection of a candidate for Governor who
was repeatedly denounced as a gold bug
and an enemy of all that the Chicago plat
form stands lor. The ballot for Governor
was: Thacher 333, Sulzer 90, Porter 20.
Senator Hill and his lieutenants never
lost control of the convention for a mo
ment, though several attempts were made
to stamoede the dele, ates to Stilzer. The
machine rolled over all opposition and
though strong protests against naming a
gold man on a silver platform was made,
the programme mapped out by tbe confer*
ence at Woiferts Roost went through with
out a serious hitch. Tbe naming of con
servative men instead of extreme silver
ites will, it is believed, prevent the plac
ing of a second Democratic ticket by the
National Democracy when their conven
tion is held in Brooklyn on September 24.
If this result is reached the threatened
split of the Democratic party in this
State is averted.
The platform with its pledge of support
to Bryan and Sewall is expected to over
come the objections of extreme silver men
to tbe candidates named, and the indorse
ment of tbe Chicago platform is tempered
by the naming of Thacher for Governor.
The middle course . chosen by Senator
Hill after weeks of thought, has been laid
down for the Democrats of tbe Empire
State, and a way is found for them to pre
serve regularity by indorsing the National
ticket and save the organization by voting
for candidates for State offices who hare
always stood for sonnd money.
There were many changes made in tbe
State Committee, and Elliott Dan fort a
succeeded James W. Hinckley as chair
man. No action was taken upon the
resignation of William F. Sheehan as a
member of tbe National Committee from
this State.
The convention was called to order at
11:02. The report of the committee on
credentials was adopted.
The committee on permanent organiza
tion selected Hon. H. H. Rockwell of Che
mung fÂ«r permanent chairman, and the
temporary secretaries were made perma
nent.
Mr. Rockwell was cordially greeted. Ha
spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Con
vention : For the nigh honor of being chosen
to preside over the further deliberations of
this most representative convention of the
great maas of Democratic voters of New York,
I return my heartielt thanks. After the ad
journment of the National Democratic Con
vention at Chicago Â« distinguished ex-Gov
ernor of this State who participated v its pro
ceedings, but who has since fled io tbe cave of
Adullam at Indianapolis, is reported to have
said that "tbe platform was just suited to the
candidates and the candidates to the plat
form," a::d although the remark wo* made by
way of disparagement, yet from the ex
pressions of sentiment which we have already
had here, and from the instructions which we
have received from our constituents, I believe
that the platform and candidates are uot only
suited to each other, but are sui ed to the
needs and requirements of the whole American
people; that they meet the approval of the
party, and that in November they will receive
the approval of the majority of the voters of
the :Srttloti.
For many years our people have had to
struggle with adverse conditions rath-r than
with political theories. Early in 1893 condi
tions which baa been sU>wl> bnt sure.y ri j en
ing, uuderafHlse and mischievous financial
system, resulted, as had b^en foreseen and
foretold, in great business adversity and a
general prostration i.f our commerce and in
dustries. Bit -ks ciused their doors, and many
of our oldest and strongest business institu
tions werÂ»* forced to the wall. Factories were
el..se<i an<i gr<ai armies of the unerapioved
.ooked despairingly < n and saw ttu-ir wives
and children suffering for the necessaries of
life.
'Ihe Congress was convened in special ses
sion for tho purpose of d vising means to re
lieve the situation.
During tne oebHtes which ensued the Sena
tor irom this Stale said in his place in the
Senate: "The permanent remedy for all our
financial evils is it return Io . he system of bi
metallism which existed previous io 1873."
Giiimeinen, we ar.- I emoira's and we are not
revolutionists. The flnaic.al evils from which
we then suffered still exist. Business still lan
guishes. Tbe arm. of ihe nnemp.oyed still
stands with foldt-d arms and wistfully waiting
to see ihe wheels of industry again in m >tion.
Our opponents offer us no remedy or relief!
If tne pollc> of s.t-artiUHt adherence to gold
in nom-tuliicm. enunciated by t iem for tne
first time in th- National piatfrrm of any
political party, shxi be made effective, then
we are without hop.-. And what .6 our rem
edy? Whai wa> ihe system o. bimetallism
w..i(h prevai.ed prior to 1873? It was the
iree and uniimi ed coinage â ! both gold and
sl.ver <>n t-quai terms and with' ut d.sorimina
:i<>u a a r.i'i<> ol practically 16 to 1, exactly
what is d mail led by the Chicago platform.
li ii the oim- a.iic system of tne constitu
tion, which, reserves to the Federal Govern2
ment the exclusive right to coin money, and
forbids the States from making anything other
than gold and silver coins of the United States
a legal tender in the payment of debts. It is
the system founded by that great conservative
statesman aud financier, Alexander Hamil
ton, by and with the advice, consent and co
operation of the father of Democracy, Thomas
Jefferson, and the other early statesmen.
In June last the Republican party assembled
In National convention at St. Louis, nomi
nated its candidates for President and V ice-
President and adopted a platform of princi
ples. It is the first square declaration in any
platform In favor ot the s:ngle standard and
In opposition to the use of silver as lawful
money. Silver is not "standard" money now,
but It is measured by gold. We have the gold
standard a. one. and tiie Republican party in
its platform demands its maintenance in viola
tion of all the pant teachings a:id policy and
n vioiatioD of the constitu:i>n.
Again I say we are Democrats and we are not
revolutionists- Revolutionists, rather apply
the term to those engaged in the attempt to
destroy one-half tfte money oi the world,
thereby, as Baron Rothschild said, accomplish
ing a destruction of values without any com
pensation, ihan to us Who are trying to return
to the monetary system which prevailed in
our country for more than eighty years, a sys
tem founded and approved by Hamilton, Jef
ferson and all the early statesmen of the Re
public.
But it is also charged that we are repudia
tl on is Is.
They lay that we are in favor of a 53-cent
dollar to be used in the payment of debts.
Our answer is that a return to the system of
bimetallism, which existed prior to 1873
means that gold and silver shall be kept at a
parity of vaiue according to. the legal ratio,
why was it that the bullion value remained
stab.c before 1873, and began to vary after
that date? Not because of the increased rela
tive position of silver. There were much
wider variations in the relative production of
the metals before 1873 than then 1 have been
since. At one period the production of gold
â was 75 per cent less than that of silver; at an
other period it was more than 200 per
cent greater. At one time silver coinage al
most ceased.
But all during this almost 100 years there
was never a moment when a melted silver
dollar of the United Stales would not bring
more than a dollar in gold in the world's
market. The use of gold and silver is almost
entirely a monetary one. People for ages
have used both for money. Neither silver nor
gold has any intrinsic value.
Their value is artificial â caused by human
desire. That desire is caused by their mone
tary use, and that alone. The value of gold
rests in the confidence that men have in a
Government that will recognize its monetary
use and stamp it as money. While men had
that same confidence in silver, it was as valua
ble when melted as wnen coined, just as cold
has continued to i>e. It was because the Gov
ernment withdrew that recognition, discrim
inated against silver, and refused to coin or
recoin it, that people lost faith in silver, and
its value as compared witn gold depreciated.
The value of a gold dol ar rests alone on the
faith of the Government, and under restored
bimetallism the value of a silver dollar would
rest on the same basis.
"But," say our opponents, "the production
of silver has been so great, owing to new dis
coveries and improved mining methods, that
its value has been destroyed and we shall have
a flood of silver if we open our mints to its
free coinage at the ratio of 16 to 1."
The ratio of 16 to 1 was established more
than sixty years ago after a careful estimate
which showed that there was in weight just
about sixteen times as much silver as gold in
the world. The proportions of values have
not materially changed. The director of the
mint has issued a table showing the amount
in ounces of production ot silver in weight
since that time has been a little more thau six
teen times that of gold. But for hundreds of
years men have been accumulating great stocks
of gold and silver which have become so enor
mous that the production of any one year, or
five years, or teu years, can have but a slight
effect on their relative value.
It was not increased production of (liver, but
it was legislation, and that alone, that caused
the depreciation of silver. Demonetization by
France and Germany and the United States
caused silver to fall in value. The repeal of
the Sherman law and the closure of the Indian
mints caused so great and 1 sudden a decline as
to clearly show the relation of cause and effect.
It. was not increased production but destruo
tion of demand for free silver that ce used its
fall ii. value.
Now we claim that what legislation de
stroyed, it can restore. We entered on the -road
to gold monometallism by legislation. Finding
that we made a mistake, let us turn back to
our starting point. That is the true meaning
of our platform. The consequences of our mis
take has been most disastrous.- Ever since
1873, prices of every thing have fallen propor
tionately with silver. A dollar in gold to-day
will buy twice as many commou commodities
as it would prior to 1873. It will buy twice as
much laud. Farms have shrunk nearly one
half. But the mortgages have not shrunk nor
the taxes, nor the notes, nor other evidences
of indebtedness.
Sliver has not depreciated, but has remained
stable as compared with other property. Gold
has appreciated, its purchasing power hat
doubled.
Talk of an honest dollar 1 An appreciated
dollar is just as dishonest as a depreciated
one. Our opponents even appeal to the labor
ing man engaged in other avocations and tell
him that the remonetization of silver Is a
scheme to raise values in the interest of the
farmer alone; that it will result in raising
the cost of living without a corresponding in
crease in wages. But let us consider who they
are who make this appeal. Every monopolist,
every oppressor of labor, is engaged witn
MarkHannain forwardiug your interests by
keeping down values aud prices for your
benefit.
Wno is Mark HannaT Go ask the sailors on
the Great Lakes, the men whom his organized
thugs in Cleveland shot and beat and starved
into submission. Go ask the miners of Ohio,
Michigan and West Virginia. Every do'.lar of
the millions which he has ttccumulated is
tainted with the sweat and blood of oppressed
and down-trodden labor. He glories in the
fact that his money and hit work secured
Major McKmley's nomination, and he ex
pects them to secure his election. With
him are engaged the great trusts and
monopolies and railroad corporations. It is
their boast that their money and their power
cannot be beaten. These are the men who are
so zealous of the interest of labor. No, my
friend:-, our interests are all bound up to
gether. For twenty years we have had con
stantly falling prices But let prices begin to
rise and cupiial will come from its hiding
places aud seek investment in profitable en
terprises. Wheii J*Â«us of Nazareth scourged
the money-cn angers from the temple, when he
denounced the Jewi.-h hierarchy, charging
them with binding heavy hardens tou griev
ous to be borne, he was denounced as a revo
lutionist And anarctiixt; when the people of
the American colonies protested against the
unjust taxation of Great Britain they were
denounced as revolutionists; when Richard
Cobden led his crusade against the unjust and
oppressive corn laws of Great Biitajn tie was
denounced as a revolution la*; wh.-n William
H. Beward pronounced that this Nation could
not endure half slave and half free
he was denounced as a revolutionist; when
Abraham Lincoln Issued the proclamation
which struck the fetters from the limbs of
mii lions of slaves he was deuounced as a revo
lutionist.
The cry of revolutionist and anarchist has
always been raised whenever man has pro
tested against existing abuses in government
and social order. But reforms have suc
ceeded, in spite of the intoleiance and perse
cution of men high in power and social posi
tion.
If we will be true to our principles, true to
our convictions and go mauiuliy forward to
the battle, we shali succeed in makiue this a
Government of the peopie. by the people and
for the people, instead of a Government of
trusts and monopolies, by trusts and monopo
lies aud for the benefit of trusts and ttonopo
lies.
Chairman Rockwell's speech was ap
plauded mildly at intervals, but when be
j-aid, "Let Bryafl be elected," there was
enthusiasm. Mure noise was made by the
spectators in the galleries than by the
delegates.
B. J. York of Kings read the report of
the committee on platform. It was as

active support, and declares as its deliberate
judgment that never in the history of toe
Democratic party he* a platform been written
which embodied more completely the inter
ests of tue whole people as distinguished from
those who seek legislation lor private benefit
than that given to the country by the National
Democratic Convention oi 1890.
The Raines liquor law is vigorously de
nounced and Governor Morton's adminis
tration severely criticized for alleged ex
travagance, 'ihe removal of veterans
from office to make room for favorites is
deplored and the building of good roads
advocated.
When lie finished reading the platform

was rapped down. The noes were more
numerous than the ayes. The vote was

PÂ«rroy challenged the decision of the
chair and demanded a rollcali. There

Moses Shire of Erie made a brief speech
nominating Robert C. Titus for Associate
Judge of the Court of Appeals. This
nomination was seconded by many dele
gases and made by acclamation.
Delegates began leaving tne bail before
the Judge ot the Court of Appeals had
been nominated. No one seemea to have
much interest in the proceedings after the
head of the ticket was determined upon.
The galleries went out with a rusb when
their idol, William Suizer, was defeated.
At 2:4o o'clock the convention adjourned

BRYAN DECIDES
TO TAKE A BATH
Fresh From the Tub the
Orator Resumes His
Talking.
VIGOR FOR THE JAWBONE
Many Short Speeches During the
Fruitless Wandering in
North Carolina.
WILLIE'3 VOICE GROWS HOARSE
But He Manages to Struggle Through
Harangues on the Subject of
Silver.
CHARLOTTE. N. C, Sept. 17.âHalf
past 8 this morning was the early
hour set by W. J. Bryan in complying
with the request of his Charlotte sup
porters to make a speech here. The
snecial train furnished Mr. Bryan by the
North Carolina State reception committee
arrived from Asbevilfe at a late hour last
night and was sidetracked while the can
didate slept. At Ba. m. Mr. Bryan left the
train, and, under escort of the local
Knights of Pythias' and numerous horse
men, proceeded to the postofflce park,
where he addressed several thousand
people at 9:30. Mr. Bryan said, among
other things:
The Republican party has been legislating to
make a dollar dearer, and they deny that legis
lation has anything to do with the dollar.
Whai provision does the Republican tarty
make for the supply of money that you need?
None whatever. I am not surprised that even
men who have been Republicans all iheirlivet
are now in favor of the free coinage of silver.
[Applause.] lam not surprised Jwhen I find
that Republicans who recognize their prin
ciples of finance and apply them to the money
question desert the Republican party
this year, when it comes out and
attempts to defend the Democratic adminis
tration which was repudiated by the Demo
cratic party itself. [Great applause.] You
remember here In North Carolina the Repub
licans have made more capital by denouncing
this administration than in any other way.
What do you think now when the Republicans
of North Carolina become the sponsors for the
Democratic adminittration? [Great applause.]
I am not surprised that earnest and sincere
Republicans prefer to stand with the Demo
cratic party in demanding bimetallism, which
even the Republican party of four years ago
â¢aid was dear to the American people through
tradition. I am not surprised that Repub
licans who eight years ago stood upon a plat
form that denounced the Democratic party lor
its attempt to demonetise silver â I am not sur
prised that tboce Republicans join with us to
day in demanding bimetallism, which has
been the historic policy of the United States,
and which until 1873 received ihe support of
all the statesmenâ Republican, Democratic,
Whig and e/ervthing we ever had in this coun
try. [Long and continuous appause.]
The special train left Charlotte for Dur
ham at 10 o'clock. The Bryan special
reached Concord at 10:35 a. m. and Mr.
Bryan delivered a short speech from the
covered stand to about a thousand people,
who were very hearty in their applause.
Mr. Bryan said that if the mints are
opened, so every man with an ounce of
silver can convert it into money there will
be no surplus to drag down the pri*e.
At Salisbury, reached at 11:15, Mr.
Bryan was introduced to 4000 people by
Theodore F. Kiuttz, chairman of the
North Carolina delegation at ChicakO, who
seconded Sir. Bryan's nomination. Con
siderable enthusiasm marked the candi
date's speech, and the cheers grew in in
tensity as he proceeded. Just as Mr.
Bryan was boarding bis train he was pre
sented with the foot of a rabbit, "killed at
midnight in a churchyard during tne dark
of the moon." Those who saw the pre
sentation manifested their appreciation of
the incident by exercising their lungs and
just as the train moved off the candidate
called out: "If the people wno have
given me rabbits' feet in this campaign
will vote for me there is no possible doubt
of my election."
GREENSBORO, N. C. Sept 17 In
company with Governor Carr, ex-Senator
Jarvis, Colonel Julian Carr of Durham,
Major Hale of Fayetteville and other
prominent North Corollna Democrats, Mr,
Bryan reached Greensboro at 12:45 p. m. A
great crowd at the station, including hun
dreds of excursionists from near-by points,
shouted vigorously as Mr. Bryan stepped
to the station platfortu, and as he was
driven through the dusty main thorough
fare of the quaint old town several thou
sand people, yelling loudly, followed his
carriage, conspicuous by its red, white and
blue decorations and four horses that
drew it to the Ben bow House, where the
candidate and his party Lad dinner.
After dinner Mr. Bryan was taken to
Blandwood, on the outskirts of the city,
where he delivered a speech, after being
introduced by demerit Manly, chairman
jof the State Democratic Committee. His
audience numbered 15.000, and was one of
the mon enthusiastic gatherings Mr.
Bryan has addressed this campaign. He
said in part:
I have talked until my throat is sore and
shaken hands until my hands are sore and you
yell until my ears are sore [laughter], and the
campaign, instead of being ended, is only
fairly commenced. [Cheers.] Sometime* the
opposition papers say people gather together
from idle curiosity. A man has to have more
than idle curiosity to stand out in the sua in
such a road as this to listen to a speech. I
was here two years ago and had a chance to
see a great many of yon, to It was not neces
sary for you to como for the purpose of seeing
me. lam glad to speak to you about the para
mount Issues of this campaign. The Demo
cratic party has taken a position, which is also
the position of the Populists and the free-sil
ver Republicans, against the issue of bonds in
time of peace and against the trafficking with
eyudicates which save the Nation at so much
per save from the extremities In which they
tnemselves have placed iha Government for
the purpose of Â»Â«ving it again at a higher
price. [Laughter.] Our opponents go upon
the theory tnat tnese syndicates are able to
bleed the people without the people know
ing it.
Mr. Bryan then repeated what he bad
said heretofore in denunciation of the
bond, syndicate contract, and added:
They tell us it is necestary to make the*e
contracts. I deny it If our Treasury Depart
ment was run iv the interest ot all the people
instead of being managed by Wall-street fiuau
ciers in their interest* it wouid not be neces
sary to make these humiliating contracts.
[Cheer*.] Our opponents are afraid if the
Chicago ticket succeeds law will not be en
forced and order will not be preserved. That
Is what they say, but that ia uot what ;hey
fear. They kuow if the Chicago ticket it
elected that the laws will not only be enforced
against the little people who transgressed, but
against the Dig ones who conspired against the
Nation. [Cheers.] They say they are afraid
property will not be secure. Your property
will be more secure under our system of
finance than it has been when men have been
licensed to prey upon your property and eat
the bread you have earned by the sweat of
your brow. [Cheers.] We not only desire to
usa the silver dollar we now have, but we
want more dollars to use among the people.
If all those who have so much money they are
afraid to have any more will vote for my op-
Donents, I want the votes of all who are not
afraid of being overwhelmed in a flood of
money. [Applause.]
I understand some of your merchants have
Drought Mexican dollars into your community
to teach the evil of free silver. [A voice,
"That's right."] Xo, it's wrong. [Laughter.]
It i* a peculiar camraiftn upon which we are
entering. Heretolore tbe merchant has been
satisfied to act as the merchant and sell his
wares to anybody who would buy, but in this
campaign the merchant has turned school
teacher and Is attempting to use his business
to teach object lessons in finance and insult
the intelligence and patriotism of those who
pay for bis goods. [Cheers.] They tell you if
we have free silver we will go to the Mexican
standard and our dollar then will be worth no
more than the Mexican dollar. When a man
tells you that, aak him whether the Mexican
dollar is good to pay taxes. He will tell you
no. You tell him your silver dollar is good
enough to pay taxes now and will be good
enough to pay taxes unaer the free coinage of
â¢ilver. [Cheers.] Ask him whether the Mexi
can dollar is good enough to pay debts with
and he will say no. You ttfli him our silver
dollar is now good enough to pay debts with
in the United States unless it is contracted
against, and under free coinage it will be as
good as it is now, and better, because we expect
to prevent the making of contracts hereafter
thai will demonetize by contract what the
Government does not demonetize by law.
[Cheers.]
And let me pause to say that while it seems
that * great many bankers deem it their duty
to support the gold standard (here is no reason
why the Western and Southern bankers should
be In favor of it. If our bankers in the West
and South would think for themselves instead
of taking their opinions ready made from
bankers In New York, who import them from
London, we wouid have more free-silver
banters. [Cheers.] If the bankers would itop
to think for a moment they would kuow if the
farmers could get better prices for their
produce they would have more money to de
posit in their banks, and the money of this
country would not be drained year after year
into the laps of those abroad who bold our
note* while we pay them in depreciated
products. [Cneers.]
RALEIGH, N. C, Sept. 17.â A stop of
ten minutes was made by William J.
Bryan's special train at Burlington, where
Mr. Bryan addressed 2000 people, includ
ing a large number of cotton operatives.
At Hilisboro several hundred people gath
ered about the train and neard a few words
from the candidate. The train was in
charge of Colonel Julian Carr, the wealthy
tobacco manuiacturer of Durham, and
was slowed down just after leaving Hilis
boro to let Mr. Bryan visit Occoneechee,
Colonel Carr's country place.
Mr. Bryan confided to Colonel Carr a
desire to take a bath when Durham was
reached, and when tbe train arrived there
at 5:15 the speech-making was postponed
while the candidate performed h:s ablu
tions at Colonel Carr's residence. At the
stand, where the speaking took place, sit
uated near the station, several thousand
people cheered Mr. Bryan to the echo
when be appeared, fresh from the tub.
RALEIGH, N. C, Sept. 17. â North
Carolina's capital city had Willia.-n J.
Bryan for its guest for two hours to-night.
Mr. Bryan arrived at 7 o'clock with Gover
nor Carr and others and was met at the
Southern Railway station by a reception
committee, a flambeau club aiut a brass
band. He was escorted to Nas!v?quare, a
beautiful open nark near tbe station,
where 6000 people had gathered in de
fiance of tbe heat to hear him. The speak
ing stand was aglow with electric lights,
the name "Bryan" being displayed in big
electric letters over the place where the
Democratic candidate stood. At each cor
ner of the square big bonfires burned ana
the lights threw the bis crowd into pictur
esque relief. Cheer after cheer went up as
the candidate ascended the stand. Clem
ent Manley. the chairman of the Demo
cratic State Committee, and Halt Ayer, the
chairman of the Populist State Commit
tee, presided jointly over the meeting.
After his speech Mr. Bryan went to the

WATSON OF GEORGIA SPOKE,
Eulogized Bryan to Bit Audiences in
Nebraska.
ALMA, Nebb., Sept. 17. â Hon. Thomas
E. Watson of Georgia reached here about
midnight last night tired out. Following
the example of his running-mate he made
speeches along the line from Lincoln to
this place. A big crowd greeted him at
Hastings and elsewhere, to whom he
made short talks. There was an immense
crowd here this afternoon, this being a
Populist community, and many farmers
came from other counties. Mr. Watson
spoke rapidly and forcefully, with enough
fire to keep the audience interested. He
did not confine himself to any one topic,
but passed over the whole Populist plat
form. He urjea the members of the
party to stand farm for the ticket Â«ud eu
logized Mr. Bryan aud the Nebraska State
nominees.
"We do not look for any help from the
East and North," said he, "because the
people there are dominated by the money
power. That was shown on Monday in
tue Maine election. Then where must we
look? To the South and West? Your in
terests are the same as our own. You
have bankers, you have railroaders, but
they are in the minority in the South and
West."
Mr. Watson insisted that he was in the
fight to stay and predicted victory. lie
was liberally applauded throughout his
address and was fallowed by local Popu
list leaders. To-night Mr. Watson spoke
to the old settlers at Republican City and
left from there for Colorado.
BLOCKED BY POPULISTS.
Scheme of Fusion in Indiana Meets With
A Uttrh
INDIANA POLIB, Ind.. Sept. 17.â The
scheme of fusion between the Democrats
and Populists was blocked to-day by the
Populists. The sub-committees of the two
organizations failed to agree after a session
of two hours in the afternoon. The Popu*
lists demanded seven of the fifteen elec
tors and the wit; draw;il of Kewali, while
the Democrats were willing to concede but
four of the electors, and demanded the
withdrawal of the Populist State ticket.
Aq soon as this was reported back to the
committee of thirteen, to which the Popn
list State convention bad delegated full
power in the maf.er of e.ectors, this com
mittee decided that it was not worthwhile
to negotiate longer, and adopted a resolu
tion that a full ticket of electors be pat ia
the field.

NOW DEFENDS HIS
FATHER'S VIEWS
Allen Tfcurman Says the
Senator Was Not a
Goldite.
WAS FOR BIMETALLISM.
Words of the Deceased States
man Quoted to Refute an
Assertion.
J. T. BBOOKS CALLED DOWN.
Information Given to Show That the
Railroad Man Was Not Correct
in His Statement
COLUMBUS. Ohio, Sept. 17. â Hon.
Allen W. Tburmstn to-day addressed an
open letter to J. T. Brooks, second vice
president of tbe Pennsylvania Railroad
Company. In a political address here
this week Mr. Brooks, who has forsaken
the Democratic party, declared that the
late ex-Senator Allen G. Thurman was a
gold man. In this connection he referred
to the attitude of Allen W. Thurman in
favor of the free coinage of silver and said :
"I appeal from tbe younger to tbe elder
Allen." It is in reply to this that Mr.
Tburroan writes as follows:
J. T. Brooks, Pittsburg, Pa.â Dear Sir: From
what I have been told end from tbe report I
saw of your speech here the ether night you
said, in speaking of the act of 1873. that you
â¢'appealed from the younger to the elder
Allen." By this you no doubt intended to
convey the idea to your audience that father
knew that the act of 1873 demonetised silver.
Why did you thus indirectly state what you
must have known to be false if you had taken
tbe least trouble to investigate?
If you bad taken the trouble to investigate
you would have found that Judge Thurman
said in the Senate: "I cannot say what took
Dlace in the House, but I know when tbe bill
was pending in the Senate, we-thought it was
merely a bill to reform the mint, regulate coin
age and fix up one thing and another, and
there is not a single man jn the Senate, I think,
unless a member of tbe committee from which
the bill came, who had the slightest idea that
there was even a squint toward demonetiza
tion."
And if you bad Intended to be honest in
your utatement you would also have reierred
to this statement, but a:so to the speech made
by bim showing bow in a codification of the
law, without ibe knowledge of scarcely
auy one, the whole villainy was perpe
trated. The further inference to be drawn
irom such reference to Judge Thur
mun was, as you must have intended it as
such, because you linked my name with his,
as if to draw a comparison be i ween the beliefs
of father and son, that he was in favor of a
gold standard. Again, if you had examined
not only tbe Congressional Record, but the
record of the monetary conference oi 1881,
you would have seeu that such ao insinuation
cauiiot be truthfully made. Iv one short para
graph at the Bru?se.a conference his words
fcettle any controversy in ibit> direction. He
said: "1 believe that bimetallism will ulti
mately prevail, lor 1 cannot see how the vast
structure of credit, the most distinguishing of
moderu industry and commerce, can be sup
ported on a gold bass alone. With both
metals its bas>e has often been found too nar
row, but with one it would be, to my appre
hension, positively unsafe." He lived nearly
fifteen years after this d duration, and if I
heard him refer to it once I did so a hundred
times, because as year by year be saw the in
creasing demand tnat was being made by the
different couutnes upon gold alone, be cieariy
saw and said hi* prediction must be verified,
or National, corporate and individual bang
ruptcy would be almost universal.
After he had gone, however, you come here
among tin: people with whom be had lived
for several years, and not directly, but Indi
rectly, try to make them believe just the op
posite of what every public and private utter
ance he ever made snowed was his belief.
There can be no meaner kind of deception
than lor a man wbo pretends to be a public
teacher, and especially when he is proclaim
ing that only his side is honest, to indirectly
atiemDt to impose upon bis audience as you
must have done upon yours. Any praise
which you may have bestowed upon Judge
Thurman only makes your deception more
flagrant. Allbn W. Thubma^.

CHICAGO, 111.. Sept. 17.â When Chair

"The report appearing in a Chicago

Was Soon Over.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Sept. 17 At 11 o'clock

Have Swallowed the
Democracy.
THEY APPEAL TO REASON
Urge the Defeat of a Ticket
Composed ot Mountebanks
and Anarchists.
TO SAVE THE PARTY* 3 NAME.
Loyal Dem crats. Are Called Upon to
Meet in Mass-Convention and
Organize.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 17.â 1n the
opinion of a iarge number of stalwart
Democrats of this county the late fusion
I of that party with the Populists has oblit
| crated the Democracy, at least for the time
! being. In view of this a provisional com
i mittee has been formed to reorganize the
\ County Democracy in order that the party
, of Jefferson and Jackson may maintain its
I autonomy. This committee has prepared
' an appeal to the tarty, which is, in part,
as follows: â¢ .
To the Lob Atige'es Democracy- The socialistic
', lenders in the lute D mocra tic. party oi the
; county, and the socialistic adherents of the
; People's party, have united to elect a set of
candidates who pander to foreign socialism
for support and have no enduring affectiou for
the principles of Democracy.
The ingenuity of those who have carried
these unholy combinations into effect will
bring inevitable ruin to the Democratic party
; unless, true and loyal Democrats rise up and
drive the traitors into political ob.ivion.
The great impetus that has been given to the
silver agitation presents the opportunity of a
lifetime for i oluii-nl mountebank* to orgenlzs
the socialistic eicmente, with a hope that the !
I i-Ã¼blic mind will be entranced by the agita- ]
| tion and become oblivious to the venal duplic
ity of rascally office-seekers who covet nomi
nations and want tfliee at any cost. These
patriots for revenue care nothing for the j
principles that a one are the ' life-sustaining
cause of the Democratic party.'
Therefore, urged by these considerations
and appealing to our fellow-Democrats for an
impartial judgment of our actions, \*c urge
them to meet in mass conventions, e:ect th-
j county commltteernen, take appropriate action i
respecting the nomination of Democratic can- !
didates.'and reorganise 'the Democratic party
in the county oi Los Angeles.

SANTA BARBARA POPULISTS.
Agree With Ventura on domination* for
th' Leg I*l 'lure.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Sept 17. âThe
county convention of the Populist party
met here to-day. and effected a. permanent
organization, with J. R. Norrisof. La Gra
ciosa for, president and A. M. Powell of
Santa Maria as secretary. ; A committee
of seven was appointed to meet alike com
mi tee from . Ventura County, to agree :
! upon a nominee for State Senator. This
joint committee in session afterward se
lected W. E. Shepard of Ventura for this
important office, a choice which was re- I
ceived by the convention with warm ap
proval. Mr. Shepard is an old resident of
Ventura and regarded as one of her best
and blest men. 'He is a lawyer by pro
fession and is the husband of Mrs. Theo
do*ia i-heparU, wnose work as a floricul
turist has. aroused such interest through
out the State. Several years aeo, although
then an avowed Populist, he was nomi
nated for the same office by the Demo
crat!", and ran far ahead of his ticket in
this Republican district. On this occasion
he in already nominated by the Democrats
and Populists of Ventura County, and his I
indors ruÂ«nt by the Democratic conven- '
tion of Santa Barbara County, which |
meets on tne 29th of September, is a fore- '
gone conclusion.
For A*Â«emblymnn from this county the
Populists, after * Â»harp conte-t between !
the opposing factions, fixed upon A. M i
Powell of Santa Maria. Mr. Powell is a
surveyor and civil engineer, a man of hiirb
character, and he is regarded as the
strongest man his parly could have found
on what is known at "the other side of
the mountains." James L. Barker the
present Assemblyman from this district,
was also before the convention with a
heavy support, but he withdrew in iavor
of Powell.
The convention will not conclude its
labors until sometime to-morrow.

about to begin. . A. J. Utley, the Populist
nominee for Superior Judge of the late
fusion combine in. Los Angeles County,
lias prerareda letter to the central com
mittee of his party declining to make the

sires to take nn active nart in the cam
paign in favor of 'he National, Congres
sional and â¢ legislative tickets, which, ac
cording to time-honored custom, he could
not do while making the race for a Judge
ship., Judge Utley has been regarded sis
one or the strong nominations of the
Popocraric convention, and much aston
ish r.:ent is expressed â at his declination.
The Judge.'" action in this instance em
phasizes the fact that he is more than
ordinarily sagacious and does not care to
lead a forlorn hope in this campaign.
Louis L ickel will. probably be substituted

GOVERNOR'S DAY AT
THE STATE FAIR
Largest Crowd of the Year
on Hand to Cheer
the Racers.
KEVERSALS OF FORM.
Wheel of Fortune Wins the Fa
vorite Stake in Very
Fast Time.
LIBERTINE'S NABROW ESCAPE.
Had It Not Been for tbe Foul Riding
of His Jockey He Would
Have Lost.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 17.â This
was tbe day the Governor and his staff
and the merchants and tbeir employes at
tended the races, and it was aptly termed
Governor's and Merchants' day. Governor
Budd and staff. In full unilorm, were pres
ent, as was by far the largest crowd of the
meeting. All of , 10,000 people saw the
sport, which was contributed entirely by
running-horses.
Tne beauty of Sacramento was repre
sented in the grand fctand. Lovely women
attired in the latest creations in summer
gowns cheered the winners, and in the
center-field the substantial, if untashion
able, rig of tbe rancher was tenanted by
his. sturdy son and freckled daughter, who
gazed upon the nport and at the specu
lators in the betting-ring with a feeling of
awe and wonderment. Tbe tout was in
bis glory. He told the countryman of tbe
deeds of Salvator and alorello, and that
worthy, in a contiding mood, bet bis
money on a selling plater as a pawnbroker
buys diamonds from a distressed member
of the theatrical profession.
The favorites couldn't lose. That is,
they didn't up to the fifth race, and then
things were just a trifle mixed. Dolore,
Chartreuse 11, Wheel of Fortune and
Libertine sauntered past tbe wire first and
then two conundrums were sprung, which
the majority of the 10,000 peopie prese nt
iaiied to guess. Favory, at odds of 10 to 1,
came in, and the "sweet thine,' r My
Sweetheart, took the hurdle race, both of
which happenings caused some commo
tion among the followers of "dope."
The Favorite stake, at a mile and a
quarter, worth $1025 to tbe winner, was
the feature oi the card. The handicapper,
who had been jollied by a ccuple of Wheel
of Fortune's "airings," let her in at 107
pounds. She rightly opened an even
money favorite, later eoing back to 7 to 5.
The Boots pair, Installator and Claudius,
coupled, had second call in the betting,
being played down from threes to 8 to 5.
Marcel, at 3, received some support,
as aid Articus at 10 to 1. ''The Wheel,"
awakened from her mesmeric sleep, kept
Installator, who maae the running. clo>e
company until a furlong from the wire,
where she gradually pulled away, and at
the end won by half a length in the fast
time of 2:0714.
Dolore was a 2 to 5 chance for the open
ing rive and a half Jurlong scramble for
two-year-olds,' and after a mild drive in
the stretch beat Grandezia, a3O to 1 shot,
out quite handily.
Eleven selling-platers started in the sec
ond race. Bookmaker Humphrey's good
mare Chartreuse ll was as usual entered
to be sold at about one-fourth her value,
and backed from evens to 7to 10 won
easily from Mainstay, al2 to 1 shot. The
mare was bid up $200 over her entered
selling price ol $500 by the owner of Main
stay.
At first sight it looked as though Liber
tine, in at 116 pounds, had struck some
thing nretty soft in the six-furlong handi
cap. He was made a 2 to 5 favorite, with
Bellicoso at 7 to 2, a well-played second
choice. Arnette was backed down from 15
to 12, while Olive, the other starter, went
back in the betting.
Macklin, on the favorite, did not get
away nrst, but he soon had the big bay in
front. Arnette hooked up with him in
the stretch, and had it not been for Mack
lin's foul riding from the furlong pole to
the wire, would have won. She was com- ]
pelled, however, to acknowledge defeat i
by a nose in 1:14. Many thought Arnette
had won, the judges' final decision being
greeted with jeers Irom the ring.
The fifjh race was a six-furlong spin,
with eleven ordinary selling platers facing
the barripr. Runimeiand Nic Nac, each at
two's held sway in the betting. The race
resulted in a dunni. for Favory, a 10 to 1
shot, collared Rummei in the stretch, and
in a drive beat the big chi-stnut son of
Flambeau out a neck, in 1:14%. Toby, a
well backed third choice, .^aiin-u the show.
The last race of the day was a miie and
a -quarter affair over five hurdles. Hunts- j
man opened a 6 to 5 choice, Out receded to
11 to 5. My Sweetheart, who was played
by the wise people.ied throughout,winning
easily from J O C. Baby Bill, heavily
played, ran like a "lobster' 1 the first part
of the race, but at the end show ed a great
burst of 8f eed.

SUICIDE AT SACRAMENTO
Walker Henry Howard Ends a
Checkered Career With
a Buliet. ,
Incessant Gambling, Bad Luck and
Brisk the Causes of ths
Tragic Act.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Bept. 17.âBe
yond the Y-street levee, in the vicinity of
Seventh street, in this city, the dead body
of Walker Henry Howard was found this
morning. In tbe ri^ht temple was a
ragged bullet-hole, while tightly clenched
in the right hand was the weapon which
inflicted it. Cause, gamNing.
From rapers found upon the body it
has been discovered that the dead man
was a mining expert of more than ordi
nary ability, >vho had spent years of his
life in Matabeleland, Africa, and later bad
explored the gold-bearing regions of the
island of Madagascar, leaving Tamatave,
a seaport of that island, with letters of
introduction from the resident United
States Consul to Patrick A. Collins, United
States Consul-General at London.
The Consul states that "these gentlemen
are both practical men and are here (in
Tamalave) from Matabelaland, where I
understand ttey were fairly successful.' 1
The ConÂ«ul commends the two men to the
Consul-General at London for advice and
counsel, assuring him that it will not be
wasted or unappreciated. The letter bears
the date June 18, 1896.
Another letter, dated Buluwayo, Febru
ary 22, 1895, informs Howard "that at
a special general meeting of the Fair Nug
get Syndicate, heid on Saturday, Febru
ary 16, it was resolved to purchase twenty
claims irom you as per your refusal of
fourteen days, dated 12th inst." He is
asked to "come into town as early as pos
> sible and transfer tbe ground." Other
letters from other firms treat of similar
negotiations in tae gold fields of Africa.
A contract shows that W. H. Howard,
E. R. Shirley, James N. Simon, Thomas
T. Hume and Richard Keif entered, on
May 26 of the present year, into an agree
ment with Eiward Petiteau by which the
latter, who held permission from the
French Government to mine ior precious
metals in Madagascar, transferred the
right to the others named for a profit
sharing consideration.
From a gentleman who had made How
ard's acquaintance while in this city it
j has been learned that the dead man's rela
tives reside in Chicago, and are presum
ably wealthy. During the short time
spent here by deceased he bucked the
games incessantly, and eventually went
broke. Then he pawned his wearing ap
parel for $25 and lost that. Disgusted
with his run of bad luck and life in gen
eral, it is supposed that he drank heavily,
walked over to the levee and shot him

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1896.
LOVERS OUTWIT
A STERN FATHER
A Dashing Young Mexican
Plays the Role of
Lochinvar.
THE GIRL AN AMERICAN.
A Wealthy One -Eyed Italian
Was Being Forced on
the Heroine,
SHE FEIGNS ACQUIESCENCE.
But the Day Before the Wedding
Rides Off With the Man of
Her Choice.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 17.â The
Lochnivar of the heathered hills of Scot
land was not more dasning and chivalrous
than Leon Morales of Comondu, who
performed a similar feat at a place below
San Quintin in Lower California not long
ago. Leon is a handsome and dashing
young Mexican of the better class, who is
widely Known in the country below San
Fernando as far south asCalmilli and over
to San Juan. He has horses and cattle of
his own, and on horseback he is considered
the most fetching young man in all that
stretch of country.
She who became his bride was an Ameri
can girl, and if romantic courtship and
heroic marriage count for anything she
will be happy with her Casiilian swain.
John Ebersoie, ;in American, went to
Sama Clara a few years ago from the
United Stakes with his wife and two half
growu daughters. He built a comfortable
adobe house, with wide verandas, and the
house becume a popular resort for neigh
bors for miles around. His nearest neigh
bor was < . a:<are Ferriotto, an Italian bach
elor, who lived a mile away. Perriotto
was a good enough man, perhaps, but bis
age and a cataract in one of his eyes did
not serve to make him particularly attrac
tive to Ebereole's eluest daughter, Anna.
Her father, however, was quite an ad
mirer of Perriotto, who owned a good deal
of land and many cattle, and one day when
Perriotto told him that he had asked Anna
to marry him and had been refused, old
Ebersoie got mad.
The father took advantage of the first
opportunity to tell his daughter that she
bad made a mistake, and that he wanted
her to marry the Italian. She replied
that death would be preferable. She could
not marry him in any event, she said, be
cause she was engaged to Leon Morales of
Comondu.
Old man Ebersoie persisted in his en
treaties and threats, week after week, until
finally tbe girl consented to marry Perri
otto. The day for the wedding was fixed,
a Justice of the Peace was summoned
from San Juan and preparations were
maae for a grand fiesta.
On the day before the wedding was to
take place, however, Anna Ebersoie se
cretly dispatched a note fo Leon Morales
informing him of tbe state of affairs. The
missive was sent by a boy, who had in
structions to ride as fast as he could and
place the note in Leon's own hands. Al
though the hour was late when the boy set
out be hastened along over the trail and
through the canyons until the following
mornin?, arriving safely at Comondu.
There was a lively hustling about on the
part of Morales when he read the message
from Anna Ebersoie. His best horse was
quickly put under the silver-mounted
saddle, and when his revolvers had been
strapped to his waist Morales put spurs to
bis dorse and galloped away.
Late in tbe afternoon the foam-flecked
thoroughbred and its rider were seen afar
off by Anna Ebersoie, who made out the
familiar form at a glance. It was an hour
beiore the wedding was to take place.
Hastily placing a wrap over her shoulders
and a hat upon her head, she disappeared
from the Douse before her actions were
noted. A moment later, wtien Mr. Eber
soie looked out of tbe open door, he was
surprised to see Leon Morales dismount
beside his daughter. Before the father
could realize the situation Leon swung the
girl upon the horde's back. Then, with
one foot in tbe stirrup, he sprang up be
fore her and planged the loug spur* into
the horse's sides. The old man appeared
beside himself with rage. Morales waved
a revolver over his head and, with an
"Adio3, adios viejol' galloped away to
Comondu. He was not followed, for both
Ebersoie and tbe Italian Perrotto feared to
pursue the fiery young Mexican.
The event happened several weeks ago
and the story was told in San Diego yes
terday. The father of the boy who carried
tbe message to Morales *ays nothing has
been beard from Comlondu since be left
Santa Clara, but be thinks the young
couple are as happy as could be expected.
Perrotto is heartbroken and old man Eber
soie is mad.

FOUND A HUSBAND
MOURNED AS DEAD
What a Seattle Milliner
Discovered in Far
Alaska.
SUPPOSEDLY MURDERED
Solution of the Degraf Mystery,
Which Has Been Im
penetrable.
WAS ABSENT FOE TEN YEARS
Strange Disappearance of a Son of the
Couple Who Have Been
Reunited.
PORTLAND, Ob., Sept. 17.â The follow
ing paragraph from an Alaska paper of
recent date recalls a sensational mystery
of a decade ago: "Mrs. Degraph (Degraf),
who, it will be remembered, left for
Jnneau last August, arrived safely and
was surprised to meet her husbind there.
They are now living at Circle City."
For ten years tbe people of" Seattle and
vicinity have believed that George Degraf,
husband of Annie Degraf. a well-known
milliner of Seattle, was murdered while
prospecting. His wife mourned bit sud
den and inexplicable disappearance, but
finally gave up hoping against hope and
accepted the inevitable. With the rapid
coming and going of daily events the
Degraf murder was partially forgotten,
and, if spoken of, always presented the
same mystery as of old.
It now appears that Degraf was not mur
dered, and that the suspicion which was
harbored against his partner, Glbbs, was
unjust. Mr. Degraf was much interested
In mining, and made frequent excursions
into Ihe country, prospecting. On one of
these trips he went into the country near
North Yakima, having as a companion a
man namea Gibbs.
Day after day passed and no tidings
were heard of Degraf. He bad disappeared
completely. Gibbs returned safe and well,
but aid not give an explanation that was
satisfactory to the authorities. The case
was investigated, and at last Gibbs was ar
rested on suspicion of having murdered
bis former companion. In the end, how
ever, it was necessary to release him, as
there was not enough evidence to justify
tbe State in prosecuting the case.
Month after month and finally year
after year rolled by, but no news came from
the missing man, and his wife was at last
compelled to accept the verdict her heart
fought against.
Then another sorrow came to her with
out apparent cause. Her son also disap
peared. When he went or how still re
mains a mystery.
With the rush to Alaska Mrs. Degraf
concluded to see what that country had in
store for her. She landed at Juneau, but
last August moved over the range to Circle
City, with the result already stated.
TULARE DEMOCRATS

VISALIA, Cal., Sept. 17.-Every day

to the cause of McKiniey and sound
.money. At the Democratic County Con

warned tbe delegates present of the grand
work being done by the Republican party
and said:
"Some of the men who usually attend
conventions in this county have undoubt
edly been influenced along this Hue, and
as a consequence their seats are vacant
to-day. We need to unite against a com
mon enemy."
For the past two weeks the local bosses
have been actively but quietly working
with country friends to stand in on the
adoption of a set of resolutions indorsing
the State Central Committee in effecting a
fusion with the Populists and silver men,

lution was accepted without a murmur:
We indorse, ratify and approve the candi
dacy of the Hon. C. H. CaÂ«tle of Merced, the
fusion nominee for Congressman In this Cou
gressional district, and pledge him the loyal
support of the Democracy of this county at the
coming election.

that no one wanted to represent this
county, resigned as a Presidential elector
and announced himself as a candidate.
He made a thorough canvaso of the Sixty
lifth District, and was assured of the nomi
nation. On arriving in Visalia Mr. Martin
came to the conclusion tnat he was to be
sacrificed, and rather than suffer defeat be
withdrew his name for the snke of har
mony. William P. Boone of Dinuba was

THE OUTLOOK IN HUMROLPT.
Sudden Turn of the Tide in Favor of
Mcliiulcy and Hobart.
EUREKA. Cal., Sept 17.â The clouds
in the political sky are fast clearing away
and a bright day is dawning for the Re-
Dublicansin HumboJdt. Secretary Gregor
of the County Central Committee was in
terviewed concerning the outlook by a
Call representat've to-day. He enter
tains little doubt but Humboldt will roll
up a neat majority for McKiniey and
Hobart. "With 1200 fusion majority
against us," said Mr. Gregor, "we began
tne campaign. Thorough and systematic
work has entirely changed tne aspect of
affairs. Republican clubs have been or
ganized in seventeen of the principal
towns of the county, and wherever a Mc-
Kiniey and a Bryan club exists, tne sound
money organization has the greater mem
bership.
"Of course," be continued, "a great deal
is due to our superior party organization
and the desire ol the Republicans to show
openly under whose banner they a c light
ing. The McKiniey Club in Eureka alone
exceeds 600 members, making it one of the
strongest clubs in the State. Our drill
corps contains 160 young men. They are
under competent officers and will present
a striking appearance when our rallies are

TRIED TO ROB A MISER
Two Men and a Boy Arrested
by Sheriff Harrison of
Mann County.
Would Have Succeedel but for an
Accident Which Caused Their
Downfall.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Sept. 16.â The
arrest of Deputy Constable Eugene Gray,
\Villiam Mannion, a gambler, and Ralph
Antonelli, the assailants of E. Wormuth,
an aged resident of Mill Valley, com
pletely establishes the innocence of Frank
Retralia, who was accused of the crime,
and brings to light a plan of robbery that
circumstances frustrated at the last mo
ment.
Antonelli was liberated yesterday. He
is but a boy and was a tool in the hands
of the two men.
The day oi the assault Wormuth re
ceived |2000 in coin. It waa shipped to
him from San Joaquin County by express.
A Mrs. McCue, who lived with the WorÂ»
mutbs, is a sister of Ralph Antonelii, and
it was owing to her presence in the house
that the receipt of the money was known.
That night Mrs. McCue and two other
women were taken by Antonelli on a hay
ride to Sausalito. Mannion then lay in
wait for the old man, thinking he would
come oui anil bury the money. Gray
watched ontside with a rifle.
When Wormuth appeared Mannion
John C Bull, Chairman Humboldt
County Central Committee*
struck him wkh a piece of rubber hose,
which burst, and so failed to seriously in
jure him. The old fellow made a great
outcry, and attracted tne attention of a
nei hbor, who saw ana recognized Gray.
Had it not beer, for the accident to Man
nion's weapon, the robbers would have
silenced Wormuth and secured the money.
Marsnal Creed had a severe struggle
with Mannion while takirtj? him to San
Rafael from Mill Valley last night. Tbe
prisoner, although handcuffed, endeavored
to secure the lines and overturn the
buggy. Creed was compelled to beat him
on the head with a revolver to subdue
him. Creed pays that while on the way to
the County Jail Mannion said, "I don't
care how guilty I am, Gray had nothing
to do with it."
There are other arrests still to be made.
The preliminary examination is set for
Saturday.

NAMES THE JUDGES
Hunt, Finn, Sawyer and
Cook Nominees of the
Fake Convention.
HUNT'S NAME HISSED.
Indignation Because Judge Heb
tard Was Turned Down by
Mahoney.
HOW THE ROLL WAS STOTFED.
Ludicrous Attempt to Impart Dignity
to a Gathering in the Name
of the F. kirs.
Martin Kelly wore a broad-gauge smile
last night as he surveyed the 150 people in
B'nai B'rith Hall, whom he had elected a
few days before at his patent, back-action,
reflex, duplex, ballot-multiplying, pri
mary election machine.
They smiled back at Martin because his
smile was an encouragement to them after
the recent pruel decision of the Supreme
Court to the effect that the County Clerk
and a few other important officials who
have the dispensation of large chunks of
patriotism were to retain their offices for
another two years.
Mr. Kelly took a front seat at one side
of the hall, while Senator Mahoney oc
cupied a seat at the other side. Both
glanced at the galleries and at the seats
around tka hali, which were occupied by
Republicans who declined to follow Mr.
Kelly's storm-beaten banner. Then the
Senator proceeded to business and buzzed
something into the ear of tbis delegate
and that delegate. It was thirty-five
minutes after 8 o'clock when C. A. Lau
meister rapped the faithful few to order.
W. A. Richardson nominated Henry I.
Kowalsky for the position of temporary
chairman. The well-trained delegates
made the election unanimous and Mr.
Kowalsky, with a shining silk hat in his
hand, ascended to the platform and made
a little speech.
He oegan by saying (without choking)
that the Republican party of San Fran
cisco was thoroughly and fully represent
ed in the convention before him.
"The Republican party of this City re
quires no boss," continued the ex-iieuten
aut-colonel. Martin Keliy, who was sit
ting in the front row, started violently and
blushefl, but was reassured by Mr. Kowal
sky looking another way and blinking his
eyes at the nearest chandelier.
"We are here for harmony," he con
tinned, feelingly, "and exteud the olive
branch to every Republican to come with
in our ranks."
There oeinj? no response to this hospit
able invitation, William Laumeister was
selected as temporary secretary, and Mark
Kelly as sergeant-at-arms.
Several delegates murmured when the
office o/ serjeant-at-arms was mentioned,
and one exclaimed: "We don't want no
sergeant-at-arms; there's only us here."
But the sergeant-at-arms was appointed
nevertheless.
The following were appointed as a com
mittee on credentials: E. B. Read, Joseph
Sparrow, J. B. McNamara, A. Hagenkamp,
William A^mubsen, P. Hoean, Robert
Pyne, A. Durlee, P. A. Lund', Max Gold
bere, William M. Conklin, Martin Lichten
s'.adter, J. A. Noble, P. Leich and F. K.
Hanson.
Martin Kelly's name was the first in the
report of the committee on credentials.
The report contained the names of several
score citizens who do not train under Mr.
Kelly, but the seats of the absentees were
filied with alternates who answered for the
missing men and thus prevented the oc
currence of any ugly gaps in the conven
tion.
Proxies of men whose names had been
used at the primaries without their knowl
edge or consent were numerous, and were
in the hands of the faithful few who were
close to the boss.
Among the names reported by the com
mittee on credentials was John D. Spreck
els, and when his name was called some
one answered "Present," but the effort
was too raw and a burst of laughter Irom
the galleries followed tne clumsy attempt
to stuff the rolL
This is only an illustration of the kin
dergarten methods pursued in th<. late
primaries. It appears that Messieurs
Kelly and Mahony failed to secure the
consent of a sufficient number of Republi
cans to allow the use of their names as
delegates. Hence the roll was stuffed
with the names of two or three score Re
publicans oi standing and political repute
to impart a tone of dignity to the political
fake.
The chair appointed the following com
mittees:
Order of businessâ H. L. Curtis, J. juevi
Jr., William Lindop, William Thompson,
William OSermann, Dexter Moran, John
G. South, W. M. Cartwright, Andrew
Murry, M. McÃvoy, M. Livingstone,
Charles H. Forbes, W. Michelsen, A.
From berg, J. C. Btevenson, L. B. Cole
man, J. J. West, Luigi Torre, Joseph
Spohn.
Platform and rules â A. Ruef, J. T. Car
roll, J. M. Ellenbrook, Joseph King, B. L
Wren, J. W. Darragh, Edward Connolly,
C. 8. Bartlett, B. Gracier, W. S. Thorgood,
M. H. Wascerwitz, John D. Dolan, L.
Howe, A. M. Pierson, C. H. Fehnemann,
H. Sheridan. Gaston Straus, M. Anthony.
After a recess of ten minutes, the greater
part of wbicb was spent in partaking of
refreshments downstairs, the committees
returned. The order of permanent busi
ness was partially reported as follows:
Permanent chairman, H. P. Sonntag;
vice-chairmen, Asa R. Wells and Carlos
G Young; secretary, A. J. Morganstern;
assistants, J. W. McCabe, S. H. Beckett
and Gus rfartmann; sergeant-at-arms, J.
P. McQuaide.
Mr. toonniag excused himself from mak
ing a speech, and Mr. Wells followed suit.
Mr. Kowalsky tools the floor and the
occasion, there boing nothing else in sight
worth taking just then, and made a speech
on the purity of the judiciary. He wound
up by moving that the chair appoint a
committee of five, consisting mainly of
pure attorneys, to select four names to be
presented to trie convention as candidates
for the Superior judgeshio.
Messrs. Kowalsky, Ruef, Forbes, Maho
ney and Carroll were appointed on the
committee, and after an absence from
the hall of not more tfan three minutes
returned and reported the names of John
Hunt, E. D. Sawyer, John F. Finn and
Carroll Cook.
There were hisses when Judge Hunt s
name was read, and an indignant delegate
shouted, "What's the matter with Heb
bard?"
The cry was repeated by several others,
and Mr. Ruef made the explanation that
he had voted for Judge Hebbard, but that
the majority of the committee did not
wan* Hebbard.
At this juncture Martin Kelly claimed
the floor, and moved that the four gentle
men reported by the committee be de
clared by acclamation to be the nominees
of the convention.
The motion was carried with a rush,
and Se.nator Mahoney announced to the
chair that he would pay the â¢'initiation
fee" of the gentlemen, they not being
present.
Jacob Levi moved that the convention
adjourn until Saturday night at 8 o'clock,
and the motion was carried.
ANARCHISTS SEND FUNDS
The local Club "Wants to Bring Out
Louise Michel and Pietro
Gori.
Money is being raised by the anarchists
all over the United States to bring out
Louise Michel and Pietro Gori in order
that they may make a lecturing tour to
disseminate tbe doctrines of anarchy.
Both these famous anarchists are at
present in .London. Gori went to the
Biitish capital to take part in the Social
istic Congress which was held a month
and a half ago, but he was not permitted
to speak, as anarchists were rigorously
excluded from the platform.
Find ng his plans frustrated in London
he went to Paris to disseminate his doc
trines, but soon crossed the channel back
to England. His anarcnift friends here
say tuat Gori would be ready enough to
strike a blow at tbe powers that be if the
brethren considered it necessary, but at
the same time they incline to the belief
that he is not connected with the alleged
anarchist plots in England and France to
blow up the Czar.
The local anarchist club, with head
quarters at the southwest corner of Union
and Powell streets, has sent an install
ment of $50 toward the general fund for
bringing out Gori and Louise Michel, and
intends soon to send more. The clubs all
over the country are contributing accord
ing to their membership and as this is one
of the weakest anarchist centers in the
United States, the general fund has
already reached considerable proportions.
Le Questione Sociale, the orgun of the
anarchists of New Jersey, states tuat Gori
and Louise Michel will sail this month
for the United States. Their coming
means a determined effort to make more
converts to the creed of anarchy.
AN EXPENSIVE ILLUSION,
A Spieler at the Mechanics' Fair
Disappeared With Some
Money.
A Protest Against an Exhibitor Giv
ing Away Souvenirsâ lrish
Night Melodies.
The sons and daughters of the Emerald
Isle invaded the Pavilion in large num
bers last evening, for it was Irish night at
the Home Industry Exposition. The re
nnion was under the auspices of the Celtic
Union.
An excellent musical programme con
sisting exclusively of national Irish aud
American airs was rendered by the or
chestra. An address on the manufactures
and commercial interests of Ireland was
delivered by the Hon. Joseph Legsett, a
trustee ot the institute. Jeremiah Deasy,
president of the Celtic Union, was chair
man of the committee of arrangements.
The exhibitors in the gallery are hav
ing a good laugh at the expense of the ex
hibitor who is conducting Jhe palace of il
lusions, near the head of the stairs, where
the half-lady, the water nymph, tde trans
forming Queen of Sheba and other mys
tifying illusions are on exhibition.
The professor, as he is called, hired a
leather-lunged spieler named McGregor to
proclaim the attractions within. On
Wednesday evening a man with a
large family presented a $10 gold piece
lor several admission tickets. The
ticket-seller did not have the change
and requested the spieler to get the money
changed. McGregor took the coin and
disappeared as mysteriously as the water
nymph inside the booth. In fact, his per
formance was so successful that he has
not been seen since, and a warrant was
sworn out for his arrest to see if the police
can find him. McGregor's single star act
cost the professor $9 80.
There is another little rumpus in the
â wind in the Pavilion. Yesterday Zahn
Bros., manufacturers of brooms, gave out
a lot of souvenirs in the shape of minia
ture brooms with leadpensil handles.
Three policemen were unable to keep the
passageway clear, so great was the de
mand for the little articles. The manage
ment of the fair has undertaken to stop
the distribution of tbe souvenirs, but the
Zauns are firmly of the ODinion
they have as much right to give away
tneir goods as any other exhibitor, and
the final decision is still in the air.
The total vote for the most popular ex
hibit stands: Johnson- Locke Mercantile
Company, 1130; Joshua Hendy Machine
Works, 1165; Crown Milling Company,
1291; Rix Compressed-air Machine Com
pany. 914; Tillman & Bendel, 673; Lau

THE BLAZE LAST NIGHT
Several Old Buildings on the Corner of
Ninth and Bryant Streets
Destroyed.
At 11:15 last evening a fire broke out in
the rear of the liquor - store of Peter
Tode, near the northwest corner
of Ninth and Bryant streets.
The flames quickly spread to
the saloon of Harry Walcom on the
corner, thence up the block, taking in L.
Scott's place. Mrs. Perry's dressmaking
establishment, 544 Ninth street, and \V.
G. Haniford's laundry, 556 Ninth.
The Fire Department, responding to the
alarm from box 187. was soon on the
ground, but the old shells of buildings
burned like tinder.
Tne engines, however, kept the flames
within the block, and then they nad it
pretty much their own way. Wal
coni's family was sleeping back of the
saloon and his little children barely es
caped, so swift was the ure going through
the old bouse.
The contents of all the places were
a total loss, with a total dam
age of about $4000. Tode's stock
of liquors will cover about half of the
general loss and is well insured. Wai
com's loss is about $1000, witii a small in
surance.
Mrs. Perry's and Haniford's losses of
about $500 each are not covered by insur
ance. The latter recently moved into the
place. The burned buildings belong to
the Shield 8 estate.
As the Commercial Fire Dispatch wagon
was rushing down Harrison street it
broke down at the corner of Seventh and
is a total wreck.
Old Dutch, Botr, Japanese Gray, English
Oaks, plain Mai QilU, White and Gold, Spanish
Cedar. Curly Kedwood and Raw Chestnut are
the proper things in Picture Frames. San born,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1896.
A NEW CHURCH
MUST BE BUILT
Parishioners of the Sacred
Heart Church Are in
Earnest.
FATHER FLOOD'S FLOCK
Larger Quarters Required to
Go On With the Good
Work.
THE DOMINICAN SISTERS.
It Is Intended Later to Turn the
Present Church Into a Parochial
School.
The last business meeting of the parish
ioners of the Sacred Heart Church pre
paratory to the fair they propose holding
next month was held last night at the
church on Fell street, near Fillmore.
James C. Nea!on presided.
The fair is to open on the first Thursday
of October in Second Regiment Hall on
Page and Gongh streets, and will continue
for two weeks.
The purpose ot the fair is to secure
funds to build a new church, and there is
every likelihood judging from the manner
in which the ladies went to the front last
night that they intend earning consider
able coin to build a fine edifice.
When the Dominican Sisters were
burned out on Golden Gate avenue four
years ago Father Flood and his parishion
ers built a house of sixteen rooms back of
the Sacred Heart Church, on Fell street,
and gave it to the sisters as an asylum.
They have been a most valuable acquisi
tion to the parish, where they have re
sided ever since. They have now upward
of 200 pupils, and all their facilities are
exhausted. Wnen the fair is over and a
new church can be built, Fati.er Flood
will turn over to the sisters the old
church, which will be turned into a
parochial scnool.
There are to be seventeen booths, and

STREETCAR ECCENTRICITIES.
Combination of Transfer Perplexities
for the Solution of the t'ot rei-uite*.
One of the latest phases of the Market
street railway eccentricities ia the varia
tion in streetcar accommodation between
the City proper and the Potrero.
Tbe last phase of perplexity is that at
certain hours of the day a red panel is
hung on the front of the Kentucky-street
electric cars which reads: "This car only
to Market street/ Further information
is hidden under red-tape rules, and ail that
remains for the passenger who is unac
quainted with the spasmodic rules issued
from day to day is to remain on the car
until it stops at Third and Market streets
and ask for a transfer to the Kearny
street line, cross Market street by dodgins
between passing vehicles and cable-cars
until he gets on to Kearny street and then
waiting ten or fiiteen minutes unt'l a
northbound car comes along, board it and
get to hi- destination.
Th s new rule is puzzling, bungling and
complicated, and gives the passengers
who travel on this line no end of annoy
ance.

FOR PRESIDENTâ
WILLIAM HcKIHLEY, or Ohio
*"OB VICF-PRKÂ«IDBXT-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
Palmer and Buckner are old, but they
are not fogies.
Really, the only question left is the sire
of McKinley's majority.
McKinley and the masses are working
for one another and are bound to win.
There is no confusion in Mr. Cator's
interest in fusion. He knows what he is
after. 1
Boss Rainey evidently knew it would
help him to capture the Democratic don
key when he set up his headquarters in
"the barn."
A clear understanding o! international
bimetallism is a sure cure for the silver
craze and at that understanding the peo
ple are rapidly arriving.
The Populists have combined with the
Republicans in North Carolina to over
throw Democratic misrule and Bryan's
talk to Buncombe was in vain.
It seems that while Popocrat fusion in
this State begins with Bryan it is directed
to the election of Cator to the United
States Senate. How do sterling Demo
crats like that?
Sound money and protection, good busi
ness and good wages, all these you will
get from McKinley, but what can you ex
pect from Bryan but industrial disturb
ance and unrest?
The estimate based on the vote of Ver
mont and Maine that the Republicans will
carry New York by 750,000 majority would
amaze the Popocrats if they were not too
much dazed to be amazed at anything.
"William Jennings Bryan to-night, sin
cle-handed, out in the open, with no muz
zle,' is the way Orator Taylor described
Wandering Willie and ala 3 how the Dem
ocratic party mourns the fact that he has
no muzzle.
The best wny to revive industry, pro
vide employment for the people and pre
pare the way for on advance of wages is to
restore the protective system. We have
always had prosperity under protection,
and we have never had it when that system
was broken down.
Congressman Newlands said in his
speech on Wednesday evening: "The true
ailies of thi3 country are those countries
which have a scarcity of money." That
proposition wili be denied by every busi
ness man. We do not wish to depend on
the trade of people wno have nothing.
The next time the Democrats have an
oratorical fifld night in this City the peo
ple would be glad to hear them discuss
the Chicago platform in full. The orators
ought to be able to say something about
frte trade, the income tax, the attack on
the Supreme Court and the denial of the
right of the Federal Government to en
force its laws.
To-morrow evening at the Auditorium
Irving M. Scott will make an address to
ironworkers on their interests in the
political issues of the day, and as no one
has a better understanding of the iron
industry than this experienced builder of
great battle-ships his address will certainly
be one of the most notable of the cam
paign. Every ironworker should hear it,
and all in this City should arrange to do
so.
According to Mr. Newlands: "While
the Democratic party was responsible for
industrial disturbances in the past
through its reductions in the tariff, it cave
a guarantee as to the future against fur
ther industrial disturbance." If such a
guarantee was given it has never been
made public and cannot be found either
in the speeches or in the silence of the
Democratic candidate for the Presidency.
If anybody has that guarantee heought to
make it Known.
Mr. Taylor of Colorado told the truth at
Metropolitan Hall when he said: "We
have seen the farmer's product fall until
it no longer pays him to produce it; we
have seen the merchant close his doors
with the Sheriff inside; we have seen
2.000,000 earnest, patient, faithful wage
workers of this land tramp the highways
in search of work." But Mr. Taylor
should have added that we did not see it
until the Democratic party broke down
the protective tariff.
Compare the United Press dispatches in
Thk Call with those of the Associated
I're3s in the other morning papers of the
City and you will see why you must take
The Call if you wish to get all the news.
For example, the Associated Press
Tapers announced yesterday that the
Texas kad grounded upon a rock in New
port harbor and was stuck fast, while the
United Press gave in The Call the com
plete news that she had Btruck a sand
bank, but was pet free in a short time.
CATOR AND FUSION.
If Thomas V. Cator has not been duped
and deceived by the Democrats who ar
ranged with him the terms of Popocrat
fusion in tnis State he will be chosen
United States Senator if the fusionists
succeed in electing a majority of the next
Legislature. Mr. Cator was nominated
for Senator by the Populist convention,
and as the Democrats have no avowed
candidate he naturally regards himself a3
being the only candidate for that office
before the people on the fusion ticket
An interview with Mr. Cator published j
in The Call this morning gives a review I
of the situation in the fusion camp suf
ficiently clear to be understood by all.
Mr. Cator was asked : "Do yon mean to
say that the resolution to effect fusion
pledged the Democrats to favor the elec
tion of the nominee of the Populists for
the position of United States Senator?"
To this he replied : "No, Ido not mean to j
say that and do not wish to be understood I
that way. I think you will agree that I j
am the logical candidate for the United
States Senatorship from either side of t!;e
House, Democratic or Populist." In an- J
swer to the question, "Why do you think |
the Democrats will support you for the
United States Senatorship?" he answered,
"I find none of the leaders are hostile. I
also find that the rank and file are
friendly. The terms of fusion or union
under the resolution took in joint action
on Legislature, Congressmen and Presi
dent."
From these statements it is clear thst I
if the Democratic coquette has not said '.
yes to Mr. Cator's wooing she has at least j
smiled on his hopes and has not said no.
Mr. Cator believes himself to be the logi
cal candidate of the fusionists, and finding
the Democratio leaders are not openly
hostile while the rank and file are seem
ingly friendly, he advocates the fusion I
scheme with all the ardor of a frank and
unsuspecting nature which in its inno
cence of guile never doubts that logic will
rule in politics.
The people of California will have to
deal with the issue on the showing that
has been made public. It may be possible
and even probable that the Democratic
managers are fooling the frank, open
minded Populist who is trusting them.
If such be the case, however, it is not
known to the public. The voters of Cali
fornia, therefore, in the election of mem- i
bers of the Legislature, will have to decide I
whether they wish the State to be repre
sented in the United States Senate by a '
Senator who will vote with Peffer, Alien j
and Tillman or one who will vote with i
Allison, Sherman, Hoar and other stal
wart supporters of the party Â©f Lincoln, J
Garfield aud Grant; whether California
will aid the vagaries of Populism or stand
for the well-tried policies of protection,
reciprocity and bimetallism.
There are reasons for believing the
fusion scheme proposes that Populists i
shall vote for Democrats for the State I
Senate, while Democrats shall vote for |
Populists to the Assembly. By this I
scheme the Senators who will hold over J
will help White to secure are-election two
years from now, and the Populist Assem
blymen will elect Cator this winter. There I
is therefore a double play in the came. It |
is a proposition of swapping one senator- '
ship for the other without regard to party j
principles or political measure?. Such a I
bargain makes one of the most important j
issues of the State campaign. No voter in ;
any legislative district can afford to ignore !
it. We cannot consent to have the great I
interests and industries of California mis- |
represented in the United States Senate
by a free-trade Democrat and a fiat-money
Populist. We must put none but Repub
licans on guard at Washington.

the measures which from Washington to Har
rison made this country the greatest, the freest,
the wealthiest, the most prosperous and the

A QUEER PROPOSITION.
Congressman Newlands of Nevada
asserted in his speech at Metropolitan
Hall la-t Wednesday evening that "while
the party (the Democratic) was respon
sible for industrial disturbance in the past
it gave a guarantee as to the future
against further industrial disturbance" by
agreeing to increase the tariff duties, and
as that party's platform upon the money
question is entirely satisfactory there is
no reason why every one should not vote
for Bryan. Mr. Newlands possesses a very
vivid imagination if he can satisfy his
mind that the Democratic party declares
for an increase in tariff duties to make up
deficiencies in revenue. He should read
the Chicago platform.
Mr. Bryan's whole public record shows
him to be a free-trader, and before he got
interested in the silver question he de
clared upon the floor of Congress that it
was the McKinJey tariff and that alone
which tad caused the industrial depression
and the consequent idleness of Romany
thousand working-people. When the
Wilson bill was pending he denounced it
because it did not make tariff duties low
enough. Mr. Bryan is the leader of the
free-traders in this country, and he would
no more agree to increase the tariff duties
than he would abandon the race for the
Presidency. Mr. Bryan believes, and has
bo announced himself time and again, that
trade between this and other countries
should be free, and that this Government
should levy an income-tax on the people
to raise money for the Nation's expense
account.
It 1b very curious that Mr. Newlands
should denounce the Democratic party for
being the cause of the industrial depres
sion which has nearly bankrupted the
whole country and then ask the people to
support its candidate for the Presidency,
especially so because every one knows
that the only objection any Democrat has
to the Wilson act is that it makes the
duties too high ana that Bryan says he
does not believe a tariff for even a little
protection can be justified. The fact of
the matter Is, Mf. Newlands is willing to
sacrifice everything to the free coinage of
silver. Apparently he would rather see
the fires drawn in every industry and the
entire working class in idleness than to
see the mints closed to the free coinage of
silver.
The difference between the advantage
the people would gain by the adoption of
Mr. Newlands 1 policy and the adoption of
the policy of the Republican party is this:
Mr. Newlands" policy would trust the
Democrats to establish protection to our
industries in the face of the fact that
they have been opposing protection all
their lives. He would run the risk of
having an income-tax law fastened upon
the country and he would help assault
the judiciary for the privilege of having
silver accepted at the mints for free an,l
unlimited coinage.
The Republican party's policy would be
to first open the industries to labor, so
that we might have prosperity in all the
walks of lite. Instead of levying an in
come tax it would oblige foreign goods
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, IBU6.
and wares to pay enough for the privilege
of enterine our markets to provide for the
Government's expense?. It would open
the mints to silver after it had agreed
with commerce that silverand gold should
be accepted as redemption money at the
option of the debtor. It should not re
auire a great deal of common-sense to see
that the Republican party's policy is
belter every way than the policy of the
Bryan-Newlands-Altgeld combine.
" You know that the financial policy laid
I down in Chicago means individual and Na-
J tional bankruptcy, distress and dishonor.
j You know that its promises are false, its prem
ises delusive, its consequence* ruinous. You
know that it means the wreck of life and fire
insurance comvanies, trust companies, sav
ings banks, banks of deposit, building and
loan associations and monetary institutions to
an enormous extent throughout the country.
You know that it means vast loss to the very
j m?n it is intended to hire, and, above all
I others, the farmer and workingmen." â An-

NEW YORK DEMOCRACY.
The New York Democracy in conven-
tion yesterday turned all the old leaders
to the wall, repudiated its declarations of
last June, and not only swallowed the
Chicago platform, but declared it to be
the most thoroughly Democratic platform
that was ever written. Last June the
party declared for the gold standard until
international bimetallism could be se
cured, and indorsed the administration of
President Cleveland, but now it swings
just as far to tl<e other extreme. It can
not be said that this is an unusually in
consistent proceeding, for if the party
were ever consistent it would not be Dem
ocratic.
But Tammany is smart, and its schemes
are hard to understand, but it is safe to
say that McKinley will carry the Btate by
a larger majority than was ever before
given to any candidate. The positive de
claration of the convention for Bryan, if
it was sincerely made, will drive all the
sound-money Democrats to Palmer di
rectly and to McKinley indirectly. Such
a combination would give the Republican
candidate a safe majority even if the
State were otherwise doubtful, which it is
not.
The first plank of the Buffalo platform
is too positive in its protestations of the
party's loyalty to Bryan and his platform.
It is not Democratic to stand so entirely
committed, and Mr. Bryan's managers
may be sure there is something wrong
somewhere. But whatever Tammany has
in view, or whatever combinations may be
offered by the Democracy, New York will
give its electoral vote to McKinley in any
event, for if Bryan is to be traded he will
lose the State, and if Tammany works
honestly for him the Cleveland, Hill and
Whitney following will use their power
and influence for Major McKinley. So far
as the electoral vote is concerned, the ac
tion of the Buffalo convention, whether it
all was a trick or not, settles the question
of how the Btate will go. The State of
New York is as safe for the Republican
candidate as Vermont or Mama is.
"It is immaterial in my judgment whether
Ihe sheep-grower has any benefit from the tariff
Â»r not. Whether he does or does not; whether
the wool manufacturer collects a compensa'
'ory duty from the consumer of woolen goods
and pays it over to the wool-grower, or collects
it and keeps it himself, or doesn't collect it at
ill, and therefore doesn't need it, lam for
free wool." â William J. Bryan.
HIS PREMISES ARE WRONG.
In his speech at Metropolitan Hall
Wednesday evening, Mr. M. P. Taylor of
Colorado, a free-silver Bryanite, got his
premises all wrong, and consequently
| his deductions were misleading. Like
a great many other people, he blames
the act demonetizing silver with caus
ing Dusiness conditions that are at
tributable to other causes. It was a mis
take to suspend silver coinage in 1873, but
| it was a mistake which the Republican
party is pledged to rectify and it can be
relied upon to do it. Mr. Taylor said :
"We have seen the farmer's product fall
and fall until it no longer pays him to pro
duce it; we have seen the merchant close
nis doors with the Sheriff inside: we have
seen 2,000,000 earnest, patient, faithful
wageworkers of this land tramp the high
ways of this country in search of work."
Mr. Taylor does not overdraw his pic
i ture of the distress of the people, but he
mistakes the cause. Silver was demone
tized in 1873, but the conditions of which
Mr.Tayior speaks did not obtain until Dem
ocratic free trade prevailed twenty years
later. The collapse of banks, the closing
of commercial houses, the shutting down
I of mills and factories, and the sending of
thousands of workingmen into idleness
dates not from 1873 but from 1893. Until
! the Democratic party rjecan to introduce
I its hurtful and discouraging policy into
j the conduct of the Government, there was
peace and plenty everywhere, because
every one who wanted employment could
i get it at most satisfying wages.
It is very true, as Mr. Taylor says, that
there has been great shrinkage in the
value of farm products, but for the most
{ part the shrinkage has been sustained in
very recent years. In 1892 our farmers
averaged nearly %l r y a ton for their grain
and a little less than 59 60 a ton in 1895.
This shrinkage was equal to nearly $387,
-i 000,000; that is to say, the farmers in what
ore called the great gram States received
$387,000,000 less for their cereals in 1895
than they did in 1892. Now, if the com
parison were made to include all farm
I products of all sections, including wool,
cotton, etc., the totals would show an
enormous loss, but it was from shrinkage
in value which began twenty years after
the suspension of silver coinage in 1873.
Between the passage of the Morrill
j tariff act in 1862 and the repeal of the Mc-
Kinley act in 1893, the material wealth of
the country multiplied itself four times
over; moreover there was not only a steady
advance in wages to labor, but there was
j employment for all who desired it. In
this same period the farming interests
grew upon strong lines, and generally
j speaking prices for farm products were
j highly remunerative. The fact is, the
j distress which Mr. Taylor talks about was
j born of free trade and not of the act of
i 1873, as the census reports and other of
j licial statistical information clearly prove.
I am quite as much, however, opposed to
cheapening the American workingman and
workingwoman as I am ti> cheapening our
aohart. lam quite as strongly in favor of
keeping day's work at home, as 1 am gold dol
lars.âEx-President Harrvson.
OBJECT-LESSON IN PROTECTION.
A correspondent of the New York
Tribune now traveling in Germany writes
his paper as follows: 'â¢ Wherever the
traveler eoes he finds contented faces.
Every one seems to have work to do.
Every factory is running on full time.
Tne streets are astir with bustle and
activity. New foundries, factories and
mills are in process of erection in every
industrial center, and building operations
are in progress on a large scale In Â«very
important town. The Fatherland to-day
is fairly pulsating with renewed energy.
Its fortunes have revived, and it has be
come a tremendous power in the modern
working world."
In 1879 Germany decided to adopt the
protective tariff system, witn no subse
quent tinkering to please party factions.
Bismarck had watched the operation of
protection in the United States, and his
conclusions were that it was the correct
system of government to make a nation
rich and powerful; bnt he saw, too, that
when a schedule of import duties had
been established it should not be made a
subject of attack for political purposes,
and so no one thinks ot amending the
tariff act of Germany, except as new trade
conditions or inventions make a change
advisable, and then it is done to strengthen
the industries. The consequence has
been that there is very little social or po
litical friction growing out of the opora
tion of the law.
As in the United States, a very large
percentage of the product of the sev
eral industrial enterprises of Germany
is consumed at home, but still there is a
surplus that has to seek markets in other
countries. When it was discovered that
tnere must be an outlet for the overpro
duction, the Government immediately set
to work to establish a merchant marine,
and now, after about seventeen years of
protection, Germany looms up as a great
industrial nation with a merchant marine
sailing every sea. But, what is more, the
individual wealth of the inhabitants is
growing at a pace that makes the people
contented with their surroundings and
correspondingly attached to the govern
ment. There is no doubt at all that to
protection more than any other public
policy is Germany indebted for her na
tional strength and individual wealth.
It is surprising that a citizen of this
country should be found opposing pro
tection, home markets and a merchant
marine when such a policy has made
Germany one of the greatest industrial
nations in the world with a demand
for all kinds of labor that is equal to the
supply in seventeen years. The lesson
that all this teaches us is that we want a
protective tariff law as a principle of gov
ernment without the shadow of politics
ever crossing its path.

MISSES' FOUR-GORED SKIRT.
A graceful skirt for misses which will retain
its shape Is shown here. It has a front gore,
one gore on either side and one gore in the
back, which is gathered at the top.
All materials may be made afttfr this model
which Is suitable for separate skirts or for cos
tumes with waist or jacket to match. All the
fullness is gathered at the back, the front and
sides fitting smoothly.
A skirt of plaid is useful to wear with extra
waists. One of blue and brown, with narrow
lines of black, yellow and pale green, had a
waist of plain brown cloth, made in Norfolk
shape, having two box pleats back and front.
A more dressy waist, to be worn with the same
skirt, had a short bolero of dark blue velvet.
Below this was a wide belt of pale green silk,
with a folded collar of the same. At the open
ing in front of the bolero was a full vest ot
blue chiffon over the green silk. The sleeves
were of me plaid, with a little cape-like top of
the blue velvet.
Mixed goods are the rage this season, and
one cannot make a mistake in getting nny
fabric with a rough surface and numberless
bright colors interwoven.
Plain skirts of serge, covert Cloth and ladies'
cloth are much us>ed for skirts, with jackets to
match, being worn either with blouse fronts
or with a silk waist.
WORSE THAN THE DISEASE.

representation of the condition of this coun
try, except that we are not dead by a loug
shot, as the 3d of November will prove. So if
we paraphrase it this way It will fit us exactly:

AROUND THE CORRIDORS
The people who are interviewed each day In
the papers sometimes have queer experiences
w'tlx men who call on them to gather further
information on the subject discussed iv the
Interview.
The miners who have made big strikes, ex
plorers, hunters of big game, travelers and
men of all sorts who have strange, oftentimes
tnriiling, experiences, such as The Call regu
larly publishes, are not infrequently visited
by not only persons who take a friendly inter
est in them, but by the purely curious. Others,
for personal reasons, desire to learn more by a
direct meeting with the principal in the story.
Yet others have personal gain as an object.
If a miner nas found a Donanza and made a
fortune, or if a visitor has met witn a streak of
luck, of any kind, he is often the recipient
of calls from men who have snaps which tliey
Selling a Qaim at the Palace by Aid of Visiting Cards*
are perfectly willing to divide up on for a
surprisingly low amount of moneyâ that is,
provided a large sum is not to be had.
Consequently the hotel clerks need grace,
for when tho promoters of different kinds
begin the first part of their negotiations they
do it by sending cards to such guests. It
means work for the dest force.
The City is full of promoters of different
kinds. Some of these have mining claims to
sell, so they send up cards. If one man is not
In, probably another Is. They keep the cards
going, for it does not coat anything but time to
see a man who is reputed to nave a pot of
money. If they catch on it pays well, and ii
they don't they don't lose anything. "
Many are the maledictions heaped on the
small army of men who in a week thus invade
the caravansaries. Still, that is what the desk
force is paid for, so the card senders allege.
Both act quietly. There are no words on
either side, but sometimes there is hard
breathing.
"There is one person," said one of the lores
at the Palace a day or two ago, "who has
come for days and has sent up card after
card regularly. He has some sort of mining
property to sell and he learns from the papers
the names of people whom he supposes might
buy. He always has a big list. If word
comes down that one man Isn't in he sends up
to another. This he continnes till he exhausts
his list or gets to see somebody."

Touching the disregard of Callfornians for
their trees Professor Brewer oi Yale College
says: "When I was in California from 18(50 to
1864 1 was so impressed with the grandeur of
the magnificent sequoias of this State that I
have been lecturing about them ever since. I
have been blowing about the big trees of Cali
fornia all these years at the risk of my reputa
tion, and now I have come back here to find
that the giant pines and firs which I have de
scribed many times as towering hundreds of
feet in the air around the slopes of Mount
Shasta have been almost entirely obliterated.
I was never bo shocked in my life, aud as if
they couldn't get them down fast enough with
the axe they are blowing them out of the
ground with dynamite." Professor Brewer
very rightly believes that there is an alarming
need for legislation that will preserve Cali
fornia forests for the benefit of succeediuK gen
erations.

WILL LOAD WHEAT FOR EUROPE
Thomas Hutcbinson, Just Out of San
Quentin, Got Away on the
Alameda.
The last of the English fleet will set
away from Sausalito in a few days. Less
than six weeks ago fourteen of the Brit
ishers were tied up in Richardsons Bay,
and not a soul knew when a charter-party
would arrive. Now no one knows when
the residents of Sausalito will see a similar
number of ships tied up opposite the most
picturesque spot in the bay of San Fran
cisco.
Of all the popular skippers who came to
San Francisco Captain Latta of the Lau
riston is one of the best liked. His vessel
arrived here on JuJy 26 last, and after dis
charging had to go out of commission, as
no one wanted to load her. She was taken
tofcausaiito and there joined the disen
gaged Meet. One after another the others
were chartered and, loading wheat, got
away for Europe. The Lauriston was left
alone at her anchorage. Finally Latta se
cured a charter, and he is now preparing
to leave Kichardsons Bay to load wheat
for Europe.
Quite a number of entertainments were
held on tbe ships while they were laid up,
and the various charities in Sausalito will
suffer on account of their departure. The
Lauriston, the last of the fleet, will leave
Richardsons Bay in a few days to load
wheat for the United Kingdom.
When the Monowai sailed last month to
Australia, Thomas Hutcbinson was a pas
senger in the steerage. He had been con
victed of grand larceny and was sentenced
to life imprisonment. Later, a woman,
who thought she was dying, confessed
that she, and not Hutchinson, had robbed
the sailor whom tiie convict was accused
of having relieved of all his spare casb.
The matter was referred to Governor
Budd, and lie pardoned young Hutchin
son. He was put aboard the Monowai,
but got drunk and wandered away. He
missed bis ship and was rearrested. Yes
terday Warden Hale pnt him aboard him
self and put three of bis deputies on
I watch to see that the young man did not
make another outbreak. When the Aia
meda sailed Hutchinson was seated on a
pile of lumber and gratefully waved an
adieu to Detective Stiiweii and half a
dozen otbers who had aided in securing
his release.
Hundreds of tons of cargo was left be
hind, but among that taken away, strange
to say, was 100 tons of bicycles. The
latter secured the first call by being first
on the ground, and canned goods were
left behind because the vessel was full
when they arrived.
The schooner Ivy sailed again last
night. Captain Murcbison, late of the
Fannie Adele. went out as master in place
of Captain Holland, who was lost over
board.
A whale was seen in the bay yesterday.
The mammal sported around tbe steamers
T. C. Walker, City of Stockton and Sunol
and made friends with the Three Broth
eis. The chances are that he wiil disport
himseil in the bay to-day and passengers
en tbe Tiburon and Sausalito ferries will
have a good view of the leviathan while
in motion.
The Alert started last night with the
schooner Volant in tow for thd wreck of
the Colombia. Four of the steamer's
boilers have been taken out and landed in
San Francisco and two, more have been
placed on lighters. The Bchoo er will
take them aboard and bring them to San
Francisco. Then the work 01 breaKing
up the hull will beein.
The German bark Rohilla, Captain
Hoyer. sails to-day for Xoyo to load red
wood for London. The Assel loaded at
the same port, and these are tbe only two
veesels that have ever taken redwood to
Europe from Noyo direct, lied wood lum
ber is much in demand in the English
market just now.
A. K. Pryor of Piper-Aden-Goodall
Company, came back from Valiejo yester
day. He says that as the Southern Pacific
is keeping spotters at work on their boats,
they intend putting spotters on the rail
road's trains and transports. Lively times
should follow around Washington and
Mission street wharves. The Southern
Pacific rate by train to Valiejo is $1, and
by steamer 25 cents. Piper-Aden-Goodall
Company are carrying all and sundry- on
tho Sunol at 10 cents. Hence the trouble.
To-day Prygr will pose as a spotter on the
s;eamer Herald.
The schooner Premier and the bark
Harry Morse both got in from tbe can
neries yesterday. Tne former reports the
death of three Chinese during tbe trip.
No report was made from the Harry
Morse, and the vessel was not allowed to
dock, pending an investigation. Just what
is the matter remains to be seen, but the
chances are that all the Chinese who died
on the Premier died from natural causes.
HELD FOR MURDER.
! Result of the Preliminary Examination
of John Collins, Long
shoreman.
The preliminary examination of John
Collins, longshoreman, charged with the
murder of Mrs. Margaret Crowley, 315
Beale street, was held before Judge Camp
bell yesterday.
The evidence was similar to that Riven
at the Coroner's inquest. Collins was in
Mrs. Crowley's house on the night of
August 22. They were drinking, and Col
lins struck one of Mrs. Crowley's chil
dren. Mrs. Crowley interfered and Collins i
knocked her down, kicked her and choked
her. She was taken to tbe City and
County Hospital, where it was found her
left leg was broken and she was suffering
from abdominal injuries. She died on
August 31 and Dr. Barren, who made the
autopsy, attributed her death to peri
tonitis.
The defense tried to show tbat Mrs.
Crowley was not knocked down by Col
lins, but fell, breaking her leg. It was
not attempted to explain how she died
from peritonitis, as Dr. Barrett had testi
fied it could not have been caused by the
broken lejr.
The Judge decided to bold Collins to
answer before the Superior Court on the
charge of murder. His attorney asked
that bonds be fixed for Collins' release
and tbe Judge said he would give his de
cision to-morrow on that point.

DRAWS HIS GUN

WOULD NOT BE BUNKOED
A Story That Recalls the Ven
tures of Planter Campbell
of Honolulu.
HOPED INTO A GAMBLING-DEN
By Polling a S ; x-Shooter He Forces
His Captors to Allow Him
to Escaps.
6. H. Rowland, the well-known mining
man from Jackson, Amador County, who
is now staying at the Grand Hotel, had an
adventure with several strangers last
"Wednesday in a room on Eddy street that
reminds him of tde Winthrop affair.
However, tbe fellows caugbt the old Cali
fornia miner with a big six-shooter in his
hand and the game stopped short, not to go
again. They decoyed him to the room as
Millionaire Campbell was decoyed, but
there were no chains and handcuffs and,
unfortunately, no arrests.
The story of Mr. Howland's ventures is
as follows: About two weeks ago How
land was strolling along the sidewalk,
near the Grand Hotel, when he was ac
costed by a brisk young man, who asked
the way to the park. He was a total
stranger, he said, and when he received
the required information he disappeared.
Several days afterward he again accosted
Howland at the door of the hotel and was
again after information. He had a lottery
ticket, which he said had won $45 and he
must get it cashed in Oakland. How
could he reach Oakland, ho asked.
Three or four days later he aeain ap
peared to the old miner as that gentleman
was taking his customary stroll along New
Montgomery street, and in a flippant man
ner stated that he had to get his ticket
cashed at 20 Eddy street, as the Oakland
agent wanted to charge him $5 commis
sion for collection. Again he was mud
dled as to localities around the City, he
was such a stranger, and asked where Eddy
street was. He was told to go to the
Baldwin ana any one there could direct
him aright.
"Ob, I don't know where the that
Baldwin is," he answered profanely.
"Suppose you take a walk up there with
me? he asked. "I don't like tne way
these bunkoing lottery chaps are act
ing."
The man who had gone through some of
the hardest places in the West was not
biting at every hook that swung in his
reach, but feeling able to take care of him
self he concluded to stand in and raise the
young fellow's ante with a full hand of
lead if there was any game.
They entered the building at 20 Eddy
street, ond in a small room found â as he
expected â a gainbline-table with several
hard- looking customers betting and win
ning "dead loads" of money. He noticed
tbat his companion flung the door, shut
the lock, springing with a click, but he
said nothing, while the ticket-chap
began with a great show of irri
tability to negotiate for his $45. He
was put off on one pretext and
another and after many hard words on
both sides was induced to take half of the
money and the rest be stated in the game.
He professed not to understand the game,
but recklessly bucked the unknown
"ti<:er," winning until he had $1000 to his
credit in the bank. All the time the old
miner, who had sat near the door with liis
band on the bidden "Colt," was asked to
go into the gajne and wia a fortune like
wise. Presently they lost patience with
him ami be^an to make threatening
demonstrations. Their manner became so
fervent that be concluded to raise the
auto, which he did with the cold "six."
"Now, you (the laneuage was not
very elegant, as an old California miner's
vocabulary is not drawing-room diction),
I've had enough of this, and if you don't
unlock this door I'll kill that bifz
dealing tbose cards, and then I'll go down
tho line, and when I get through the
Coroner will have a job that will last him
all day. I haven't kicked around White
Pine, Virginia City. Leadville and Tomb
stone for years not to see througn your
raw work before the cards were sbulHed.
Unlock tbat door, and quick, too!"
It was opened.
And the old gentleman settled his gun
back in Uis trousers pocket as he walked
down the stairs to the street Ana he
smiled sottly to himself and muttered
something about "best mid plans," etc.
Howland was in charge of the first
Pullman train that came across the con
tinent in the early seventies. It was
switched on to the Fourth-street car
track and was run up on Market street to
Montgomery where the passengers â the
Boston Board of Trade â were landed and
the splendid coaches exhibited to the
people of ban Francisco.
WARNING THE PUBLIC.
Superintendent Flint Says Uncle Sam's
Mall Must Not Be Obstructed or
Retarded.
Thfl following letter from Superintend
ent Flint of the railway mail service is
self-explanatory :
San Francisco, Cal., Sept. 17, 1896.
The general public has been notified through
the press that a railway postoffice service has
been established in the City of Ban Francisco
for the purpose of enhancing the delivery and
dispatch of mail from all portions of the City
contiguous to the lines over which said service
has been established. A time card lias been
made upon which these cars will run. In order
to have the public served in the bestpossible
manner it is absolutely necessary that the
schedule as made should be closely adhered to
in the running of these cars.
la this connection I would invite the atten
tion of the public to section 694 of the postal
laws and regulations of 1893 In relation to
penalty for obstructing the malls, which is fol
lows:
"Any person who shall knowingly and â will
fully obstruct or retard the passage of the
mail, or any carriage, horse, driver, or carrier
carrying tho same, shall, for every such offense,
be punishable by a flue ef not more than one
hundred dollars." (Revised Statutes, 3995.)
I think it will only be necessary to call the
attention of the public to this section in
order to have all Dersons traversing the streets
of San Francisco give these cars free passage
way over such streets, to prevent detention to
the United States mail*. Very respectfully,
Samuel Flint, Superintendent

Charge of forging pension certificates. Tues
day he visited several railroad offices, pre

ernment, and altogether he Becured four of
these tickets, which he proceeded to sell, real
ising â¢uflicient to purchase a ticket ior Chi
cago. He left for that city Wednesday and is
expected to reach Ogden this morning. The
Government authorities at that place are on
the lookout and it will be difficult for him to
escape arrest. The unusual number of tickets
asked for on Tuesday is what led to the detec
tion of Lawrence.

WEKE MARSHALED BY DR. TITUS
The American Policy Club Leads the
Slump and Other Delegates
Follow.
Forty of the hundred delegates who at
tended tbe American Protective Associa
tion Municipal Convention at 102 O'Farrell
street last evening bolted deliberately and
concertedly, and caused much excitement
in the gathering.
The leaders of tbe bolt admitted after
ward that they went there with the full
intention of seeking an excuse to walkout,
and that they will continue as bolters as
long as the association persists in its pres
ent course regarding the nomination of
municipal officers.
The forty and some others who did not
take part in the bolt believe that it is the
better policy to wait until the various
parties have all held their conventions
and nominated candidates before putting
forth the association's choices. The re

rapped for order last evening there was a
panicky feeling in the hall that increased
until the climax came.
The feeling among the delegates was
shown by the remarks that were made be
fore the convention was well under way.
"Throw him out the window!" yelled
one delegate as another man rose to speak,
and similar expressions came from other
parts ot the hall. The bolters saw no op
portunity to carry out their purpose until
the report of the committee on resolutions
was reached. This body had provided a
measure limiting speeches to three min
utes.
Dr. Titus, the leader of the bolters, took
this as his cue and delivered a strong talk
against it, terming it a gag resolution and
an outrage. In spite of his protest the
measure was adopted, and then the bolters
boiled.

SUSPICIOUS FIRE.
Fire Marshal Towe Investigating- the
Bush-Street Saloon Affair.
Fire Marshal Towe continued his inves
tigation yesterday into the cause of the
incendiary fire in the saloon at 311 Bush
street early Wednesday morning, pub
lished exclusively in yesterday's Call.
He bad M. C. Wenceslow, the proprietor
of the saloon, at his office and took his
statement under oath. Wenceslow admit
ted tbat he had two policies on his stock
and fixtures, one for $1000 with the Home
Mutual, taken out in June, and the other
for $2500 with the Home Phoenix, taken
out on September 8. He admitted that all
the fixtures and furniture in tbe saloon
were tbe property of Mrs. Sullivan, the
owner, and that he insured property tbat
did not belong to nim. He did not give
any satisfactory reason for doing so.
Another fact the Fire Marshal brought
out was that on Tuesday Wenceslow, or
Winslow, as he sometimes calls himself,
sent some one to the Home Mutual office
to ask for a permiWto take other insurance

LAST SHOT FROM
THE GRAND JURY
Waste, Extravagance and
Incompetency of City
Officers.
AN UNFAIR ASSESSMENT
Astounding Increase of Expenses
in the Department of
Education.
THE TEACHERS AND JANITORS.
Golden Gate Park, Board of Health
and the Harbor Commission
Reviewed.
The Grand Jury, which was impaneled
by Judge Sanderson December 30. 1895,
submitted its final report yesterday to
Charles F. Slack, Presiding Judge of thÂ«
Superior Court, and the members were
discharged from further service.
During the forenoon yesterday commit
tee meetings were held to close up the
business of the term. At 1 :30 o'clock p. m.
the jury met as a body and found an in
dictment for felonyâ obtaining money
under false pretences â against Leo de
Cordona. The case against Cordona is not
exactly a new one. On April 10, 1895, he
was a bookkeeper in the office of the Su
perintendent of Streets and raised the
treasury demand of Oscar McElroy from
$7 50 to $57 50. Other demands were also
raised. The fraud was discovered before
the City was a loser. Cordona was ar
rested, but escaped conviction on a techni
cality. It seems that/he Treasurer's name,
Widber, was spelled Wilbur and so Cordona
was not convicted. He has been in jail
since and will now be tried on the Grand
Jury indictment. J. B. Gartland, book
keeper of the Street Department, was the
only witness required, although Auditor
Broderick, Deputy Treasurer Louis Jacobs
and Detective Cody vrere present in
obedience to subpenas.
Wiien Foreman Frank Maskey presented
the final report of the jury to Judge Slack
and as&ed to be discharged the court said :
"I thank you for your efficient and f aitnf ul
service. 1 am sure that you have been loyal
to your duty, and your work has not been
in vain. The Grrand Jury is now dis
charged."
The following members of the jury were
present in the courtioom: Frank Maskey,
Frank P. McLennan, Alpheua Bull Jr., P.
P. Butler, E. E. Chever, John F. Ciine,
Louis Feldmann, H. H. Hencke. John
Landers, C. S. Liaumeister, Edward Mai
ley, Jacob Martenstein, X McG. McÃean,
C." O'Connor, T. F. Payne.
The report is an able and elaborate docu
ment of 9000 words. Speaking of the
Assessor's office it says:
The action of the Assessor of this City and
County is leu in every household and business
place. In a slightly modified lorm lie virtu
ally dictates the value of ail personal and real
property for taxation or revenue purposes.
The' business intrusted to him is varied aua of
vast proportions, and necessarily there must
be much of the detail work of the office in
trusted to subordinates. That there should be
some irregularities in assessing is to be ex
pected, but the amount of same should be re
duced to a minimum if an undeviatlng, clear
and just code of rules prevails. All owners of
property should be treated alike, whether rich
or poor. There should be no diEtinction be
tween persons or classes of citizens or corpora
tions.
The attention of the Grand Jury was called
to some alleged gross irregularities of assess
ments in the property of certain large cor
porations doing business in tnis City. Asses
sor Siebe appeared before the Grand Jury to
explain the condition of said assessments. He
gave written memoranda as to the amounts
that were assessed, but no intelligible expla
nation or definite plan of the me mods of
making such assessments. The Grand Jury
had made examination as to the cash value of
the stock and bonds of said corporations at
the time of assessment, and taking 50 per cent
of said values informed Assessor Sieba that
such was a proper valuation to be assessed. In
stead of accepting the same. Assessor Siebe sub
sequently reduced the assessments of some of
the corporations below the memoranda he had
furnished, stating that he did not assess!bonds,
as they were not taxable. As stocks, bonds
and all property must be considered as evi
dence in arriving at the real value in assessing
corporations, this seems a subterfuge. In the
cases of the Central Gas Company, which haa
leased its plant for a term of years to the
Pacific Gas Improvement Company, the said
plant was not assessed to either of the com
panies, and the only assessment of the Central
Gas Company was upon real estate assessed at
$41,470. Assessor siebe erroneously claimed
the company was defunct or dead, which is
not a fact, as its 20,000 shares of stock on the
day of assessment were selling at $95 a share,
a total value 01 $1,900,000. The Grand Jury's
valuation of 50 per cent was $950,000, so over
$900,000 escaped assessment in this one com
pany. The late decision of the Superior Court
that the Assessor was a semi-judicial officer for
bids any hope that an actlou for removal from
office would be successful if undertaken.
To the School Department this refer
ence is made:
We have made an examination of the Items
of expense for which an increased appropria
tion is asked and find thÂ« one item of teachers'
salaries Is $895,000. to which janitors', office
and shop salaries added makes a gross total of
$962,500 for salaries alone.
In 1883-84 there were 31,578 pupils average
attendance, with 714 teacners, with salaries
$057,824; while In 1895-96, with 32,436 aver
age attendance, there were 928 teachers with
salaries of $872,311. Thus an Increase of 858
pupils has been attended by an increase of 214
teachers and an Increased expense of .*214 487
for teachers' salaries. Brie-fly summed up
there nas been an increase of about 2% per
cent of pupils attended by an increase of about
33 per cent of teachers and an increase of 32
percent in teachers' salaries. In the list of
teachers' salaries of 1895-96 we find special
teachers receive salaries of from $190 to $50
per month, cooking teachers $100 to $00 per
month, and sewing teachers $75 to $50 per
month. ' .
The demand of the Board of Education for
appropriation lor the coming year for new
school buildings we hold to be excessive and
ii' warranted either by actual requirements
of pupils or demanded in the Interest of tax
payers. There li no argent necessity for a
high school building in the Mission district, as
the Horace Mann School it* arranged to accom
modate a junior class that so far has not yet
been filled. Tee $200,000 asked for a Mission
high school is therefore not needed. The same
comiii.ori as to necessity applies to other
school buildings proposed to be erected. New
scnool buildings will, however, in a few years
be required to take the place of some
now in use, and we think they should
be provided for, not In appropriations from
taxes of specific years, but by bonds,
or, better still, by rental of the Fifth and
Market street lot for a long term of years.
The schools now on this property, i.e., the
Linooln Grammar and the Webster Primary,
should be provided for by new buildings- on
one of the streets further south. The Market
street frontage of the school lot is now covered
with wooden buildings, which pay a rental of
about $37,000 per year. The entire lotâloo
vara squareâ if rente I for a long term of years,
would give income enough to annually erect
three ii not four buildings, which would be all
the increase that the School Department would
require for many years to come. It will re
quire an act of the Legislature to authorize
the rental of the property for more than ten
years, also time to , receive proposals , for . leas
ing. In about two years the â¢ longest lease of
the Market-street frontage will expire, and
during the interim the lot could be leased and
the new buildings for the present school be
provided for elsewhere. 43Kri&9Bjl9KX
COUNTY CLERK.
The expenses oi the County Clerk's office
during tne term of the incumbent have been in
excess of the expeditures of his predecessor in
office. This increased expenditure so mr as we
can ascertain has no 1 been caused by increased
business, but by the arbitrary excess of em
ployes appointed by the present County Clerk.
It is unfortunate for the taxpayers of this City
that the appointment of deputies and clerks is
within certain limits lodged in the hands of
the County Clerk and that the excessive sala
ries paid are fixed by statute.
The only remedy against extravagant ex
penditures in the County Clerk's office we can
bee lies in the adopting of the proposed new
charter by which the number of clerks and
salaries of same can be regulated by the City
government instead of as now by the inclina
tion or interest of the incumbent under the
present statute. 41
SUPERINTENDENT OF STREETS.
To properly perform the duties of his office
the Superintendent of Streets should have the
technical knowledge of a civil engineer with
the determination to personally know and
ability to supervise all the important business
of his office.- The present Superintendent has
but a limited knowledge of civil engineering.
Further he has stated to the Grand Jury that
he does not know personally the details or in
fact the cost of the very important items of
work for which he at first asked appropri
ations for the present fiscal year. He asked
for the enormous sum of $1,558,180 â
million five hundred and fifty-'.ight thousand
one hundred and eighty dollars â an increase
of more than one million dollars over the ap
propriation allowed in the preceding year.
Upon Inquiry the Superintendent stated
thai he had made estimates for the item of
"paving the accepted blocks and crossings on
Van Ness avenue that are now macadamized"
($46,630 10). and for other large items he had
no specifications as to the probable cost.
The repaying of Folsoin street easterly with
bituminous rock in view of heavy teaming
over a portion of the same can well be left
until later. The repaying of streets now paved
with cobbles, estimated at $400,000, can also
be left until later years, as the necessity is not
urgent, and, in fact, the Superintendent did
not expect the appropriation to be made.
For the purpose of ascertaining the probable
cost of completing the water-front portion
chargeable to the City, it comueteut contractor
made examination and stated his willingness
to make all repairs, including some new work
required in piling, planking and filling in ior
about $16,000, instead of the $150,000 appro
printion asked by the Superintendent of
Streets for the same purpose.
An inspection of Market street from Valencia
street to the ferries Â»hows the pavement of
basalt blocks to be irregular in spots in many
places. The work of repaying is, however,
limited, and a comparatively small sum, if
judiciously expended, would put the street in
comparatively good order. The heavy team
ing on Market street forbids the use of bitu
minous pavement, as the latter would require
continuous and excessive costly repairs. The
taxpayers of this City have had obicct-lessous
in Third street, between Market and Howard,
and Golden Gate avenue, in the past of the
grinding and destroying action of even a
limited heavy truck travel on bituminous
pavement.
The Superintendent of Streets should be a
competent civil engineer, but a Board of Pub
lic Works composed. of civil engineers, as re
quired by the proposed new charter, would be
still better for the interests of the taxpayers
of this City.
The present system of street repairs is so ex
pensive and unsatisfactory that we recommend
in the interest of economy that repairing in
future be done by contract whenever possible.
PARK COMMISSION.
The Golden Gate Park is the great pleasure
ground of the. people of this City. Rich and
poor alike enjoy its beauties and have a just
pride in comparing it witn the parks of other
cities. The present Grand Jury shares these
feelings with other citizens, but its duty de
mands that it investigate the expenditures
made by the Park Commissioners and ascer
tain whether the large sums furnished have
been expended judiciously and with regard to
economy that it. used in private business.
In the appropriations asked for the past
fiscal year was an item for a park lodge build
ing, to cost $20,000. This building has been
completed at a cost of over $52,000. The su
perintendent's salary is $350 per month, or
$4200 per annum, and the portion of the lodge
for his residence given free is fully equal to
$600 per annum more, a total of $4800 per
year.
The Grand Jury feels that the taxpayers
have not been fairly dealt with in the in
creased expenditure on the lodge building â
$32,000 above the amount asked for the said
purpose; that the salary of the superintendent
is excessive â the original act provided for a
superintendent at a salary not exceeding $200
per month, and that the cost of reclaiming
land for lawn purposes. $851 49 per acre, is far
in excess of what it should be.
The Park Commission is one of the anomalies
in the State found in our City and County
government alone, its members being ap
pointed by the Governor of the State; Its ex
penditures not subject as in other departments
to approval of the Auditor, and no advertising
ior supplies to De furnished on contracts by
the lowest bidder. :
All the interest the commission has in the
City and County is that the Supervisors shall
make appropriations us demanded, the Com
missioners making their annual report not to
the City, but addressed to the Governor direct.
I An instance of the Commissioners' method
!of doing business was shown in the con-
I struction of the wire bridge some years since
â  at a cost of about $10,000. There was no ad
j vertising for the construction of the bridge,
! and in fact there was no knowledge of the in
tention of the Commissioners by the California
Wire Works, the largest wire-bridge builders
In the State, until the press announced the
contract had been awarded to the agent of an
Eastern company.
The Park Commissioners have asked the
Board of Supervisors for an appropriation of
$365,000â 51000 per dayâ for the coming fiscal
year. The Grand Jury believes the|same to be
grossly excessive and not warranted in pro
viding for the maintenance and improvement
of Golden Gate Park, and in place recommend
that an appropriation of only $200,000 be
made. This would not only be ample for the
maintenance, out would admit of the comple
tion of such improvements as have been com
menced.
HEALTH DEPARTMENT.
The duties of the Health Department are ex
ercised by a Board of Health, all the members
of which, except the Mayor, who is ex-officio
chairman, are appointed by the Governor of
the State. In this particular San Francisco Is
the exception, as all the other counties and
| cities are empowered by Jaw to appoint their
own Boards of Health and regulate the num
ber and salaries of the employes connected
therewith. â¢ " .
The result is that the Boards of Health of
this City and County, as a rule, "have shown
a fine scorn of economies" in the discharge of
their duties and demand with the arrogance
of irresponsibility that their orders or requi
sitions shall be obeyed. It is true that the
City government nominally â  controls appro
priations, but under the decisions of court it is
a question, if the issue was made, whether this
position could be maintained.
The Board of Health employs a large staff
of officials, and is demanding larger appropri
ations for the present fiscal year to in
crease the number of employes. While it is
possible that employment for these additional
officials can be found, the Grand Jury can see
no imperative necessity for them at the time
while a low tax rate is demanded in the in
terest of the taxpayers. On the contrary, it
would seem that the present officials could
and should to a larger extent perform the
duties stated for which the additional force of
employes is asked.
Among the items of appropriations asked is
that of a quarantine service which includes
the expense ol a quarantine officer, the use of
a quarantine steamer, attaches and fuel. The
establishment of quarantine service by the
Health Department at first was imperatively
demanded to prevent the introduction of con
tagious disease from foreign places, via the sea.
Within the past year, however, the National
Government has established a quarantine
boarding service in connection with the quar
antine grounds and buildings on Angel Island.
The Grnnd Jury does not see the utility of
continuing a City quarantine service in addi
tion to that performed by the United States.
The aggregate monthly charges for salaries is
$495 per month, to which is to be added fuel
and repairs to steamer, the total cost of the
quarantine service being about $7500 per
annum, which ought to be dispensed with.
Reference is made to the excellent serv
ice of Superintendent Weaver of the Alms
house and of his unwarranted removal by
the Board of Health.
The Recorder's neglect to obey the fee
I bill of 1895, and his conduct in collecting
fees higher- than the law justifies come in
for censure.
The Police Judges are hauled over the
coals for the loose manner in which the
records of lines collected are kept. . Some
months ago The Call explained the lack
of system in accounting lor the collection
of Police Court fanes and forfeitures.
PRESENTATION OF SUPERVISORS.
Jn regard to the presentation of Super
visors the Grand Jury thus speaks:
It has been a matter of notoriety. that assess
ments of property have been unequally made;
that large corporations doing business in the
City have not paid their proper proportion of
taxation in previous years. The present Grand
Jury, desirous that a fair assessment of prop
erty should be made, instituted inquiry as to
the value of the assets of a number of large
corporations/ also the statements of the As
sessor regarding the same. It was found that
aSO per cent market valuation of these corpo
rations' stocks and bonds was about $11,000,
-000 more than : they were assessed. This in
formation was.sent to the Board of Equaliza
tion. i. c., Board of Supervisors, and a number
of Grand Jurors attended, by invitation, and
addressed the board at a subsequent session of
that body.. The board at. a later meeting re
duced the assessments of these corporations
much below the. amounts stated by the As
sessor. As it was the duty of the Board of
Equalization to examine as to the correctness
of the assessments, and reliable information
presented by the Grand Jury was not consid
ered by them, the seven Supervisors who voted
for the reduction of assessments, were presented
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1896.
for removal from office. The Code provides for
the removal of officers for willful or corrupt
neglect of the duties of their offices, and in
this case the evidence seemed so plain that ac
tion had to be taken by the Grand Jury.
Attention is 'called to the waste which
prevails owing to the present system
which allows anybody at the head of a de
partment to order printing. It is sug
gested that the entire business in this re
spect should be placed in the bands of the
clerk of the Hoard of Supervisors.
WATER RATES FOR SHIPPING.
Complaints were made to the Grand Jury
that excessive charges for supplying water to
shipping at the wharves were maae by the
lessees from the Spring Valley Water Works.
A communication stating the facts was pre
sented to the Board of Supervisors, asking
them in making water rates for the years
1896-97 to reduce them to a fair and just rate
compared with other consumers. The
communication was never acknowledged or
considered, but the former exorbitant rate
oi $1 75 i>er 1000 gallons was fixed, as was
the water rates for the entire City, at one
short session and without discussion. The
attention of the officers of the corporation was
called to the injustice done and they have
taken the supplying of water to shipping into
their own hand. 1 - and have already made a de
duction of 30 per cent, from the old rates
charged, with a promise of further reduction
as soon as the nctunl expense of furnishing
can be ascertained. The water company's
officers are to be complimented for greater at
tention to the wants of our citizens than our
own Board of Supervisors.
The Grand Jury regards it disgraceful
that the City should have a floating in
debtedness; that it has not paid mer
chants for supplies purchased in 1892-93.
The report says: "The Grand Jury can
not recommend any specific line of action
on the part of the City to pay its present
debt other than that the Election Com
missioners place it as a question on the
ballot for voting at the coming election."
The insufficiency of accommodation for
the insane is mentioned.
THE NEW CHARTER.
The Grand Jury recommends the adop
tion of the new charter, presenting this ar
gument:
We recommend the adoption of the pro
posed new charter to the citizens of San Fran
cisco, as the only means of speedy relief that
can be had from the present corrupt and ex
travagant political management of municipal
affairs.
With the adoption of the new charter will
come au economical administration, by which
at least 30 per cent can be saved.
With a tax rate not exceeding 80 or 90 cents
on the $100 assessed valuation of property
each year, a prosperous change can be effected,
giving confidence to investors in manufactur
ing enterprises, real estate and general busi
ness.
We recommend the necessary legislation to
Insure home rule and freedom irom inter
ference mid management in local affairs by
State appointees.
HARBOR COMMISSION.
Citizens are urged to petition the Leg
islature t > abolish the State Board of Har
bor Commissioners and to have the trust
in the management of our water front re
turned to the City.
Concerning the rights of the United
StateÃ Government to improve the harbor
of San Francisco and remove sunken
rocks from the bay, the Grand Jury pre
sents figures to show that the Govern
ment has only appropriated $110,000 for
this work, but has expended $1,780,000 on
an estuary in Alameda County.
Figures are adduced showing that duties
amounting to two hundred million dollars
have been collected at this port since the
State was admitted to the Union. It is
said that one rock has caused twenty-five
shipwrecks. The report says: "The Na
tional Government claims jurisdiction
over all our navigable waters and should
certainly afford such relief as is necessary
in tne way of the removal of dangerous
rocks, the dredging of the harbor, and in
deed should undertake the building of the
bulkhead and save us from a tax which is
too onerous for our commerce to bear."
A letter presenting these facts and con
clusions has been sent by the Grand
Jury to Judge Maguire, a member of Con
gress from the Fourth District.
DRIED FRUIT TO EUROPE
Shipments Can Now Be Made
Direct to England and the
Continent.
R ductd Rates Have Bsen Arranged
for by the Southern Pacific
Company.
In order to aid the dried fruit industry
of California the Southern Pacific Com
pany has made arrangements whereby
shipments of dried fruit can be made di
rect from any point in the State to the
principal cities of Europe.
Heretofore but little of this class of
goods das cone to Europe, owing to the
supply having found a market in this
country, but this season stocks have ac
cumulated to such an extent that prices
have fallen considerably below the usual
figures.
Another reason why no outlet to the
European market was attempted before
was that freight rates were not favorable.
Under the arrangements effected by tne
Poutnern Pacific the rates have been ma
terially reduced, so that a saving of about
25 per cent of the former tariff is made.
Tne new rales, which went into effect yes
terday, are as follows:

These rates are for carload lots of not
less than 24,000 pounds and only apply
over the Sunset route to New Orleans,
whence the Morgan line of steamers will
convey the consignments to New York.
Here close- connection will be made for the
port of destination.
It is expected that the new departure
will open up a considerable field for the
consumption of California dried fruits and
thus tena to advance prices and stimulate j
the trade in all its channels down to the
fruit grower.
VOTERS FOR SUFFRAGE.
Precinct Workers Find That They Will
Outnumber the Opponents Three
to One.
The precinct woman suffragist workers
are busy getting pledges from voters to
cast their ballots for the suffrage amend
ment. Thus far about 6000 voters have
been interviewed and stand about 3 to 1
in favor of the amendment. The ladies
are hard worked, but the encouragement
which seems to greet them at every turn
makes their labors much lighter than they
would otherwise be.
A Show In Himself.
This evening Frank Lincoln, whose occupa
tion is to dispel melancholy and provoke
mirth, will give one of his popular entertain
ments in the Y. M. C. A. Auditorium. His en
tertainment is a sort of humorous monologue,
consisting of musical travesties, sociwl satires
and numberless stories and impersonations
which he has picked up In all countries dur
ing the last five rears. He has raised a laugh
upon the lips of kings, and has brought a
chuckle to audiences all over the world, ior
there are but two English-speaking countries
that he has not beeu in. HiÃ entertainment
here will be under the patronage of a number
of well-known society ladies. Mr. Lincoln
comes here highly rscommended by promi
nent newspapers, actors and playwrights.

AN OLD BOHEMIAN
NEARING THE END
Demetrius G. Camarinos Is
Lying at the Point
of Death.
KING OF THE "SPARTA."
He Dispensed His Hospitality
With More Than a Lav
ish Hand.
NOW HE IS IN A HOSPITAL.
His Bohemian Friends Are Unab'e to
Help Him in His Hour of
G-eat Need.
Demetrius G. Camarinos, mine host of
the Sparta when it was in all its grandeur;
a bohemian, whose love for the good
things of this world made him a "good
thing' 1 for the bohemians he chose to
gather about him, is penniless, almost de
seited, and lyine at death's door at the
French Hospital.
It is a strange story, that of Demetrius
George Camarinos, crowded into the 41
D. G. Camarinos.
years he has been on this earth, the first
peep at which he took in classic Athens,
Greece.
He came here in 1875 a poor man. Start
ing as a fruit peddler, be acquired a fruit
store at the corner of Suiter and Powell
streets, where, during the five years he
presided over the institution, he succeeded
in acquiring a moderate competency and
a fairly good knowledge of the English
language. Subsequently he branched out
as a wholesale dealer in produce, Â«nd ow
ing to his connection with a younger
brother in Honolulu he was enabled to
outstride his competitors and he soon be
came one of the fruit kings of the commis
sion trade.
Honors were cast upon him as his bank
roll became rounded. In 1892 he was ap
pointed by King George of Greece as Con
sular representative in this State, succeed
ing Harry Cooke, a wholesale leather mer
chant, who died in 1891. When tbe Beat
of the Consulate was removed to Los An
geles, in 1894, Camarinos resigned. At
that time he was conducting the "Sparta,"
at Sansome and Merchant streets, as de
lightful an oasis as conld be found in the
downtown desert part of the City.
The cooking was delicate and the serv
ice refined. Bankers, merchants and
others aole to pay for the good things
they liked crowded to the house of this
Grecian Consul, who did not hesitate to
step into the kitchen and make a saute
sec or a poulet a la Marengo for his
friends. Newspaper men heralded Cam
arinos everywhere as a prince of good fel
lows, and he liked their adulation, while
with aue modesty he placed his right
hand over his heart, bowed and declared
he did not deserve it.
One of the Consul's best friends was
Harry Bigelow, a clever writer and aa
ultra bohemian. The last time Camari
nos was seen on the streets of this City
was at his friend "Pete's" funeral.
Eddie Morphy, who went to the Ja
panese-Chinese war some years ago and
who fell in love with Japan and stayed
there, is another of Camarinos' friends.
There were scores of them â good fellows,
bright, witty, bon-vivantsâ but all im
provident. Camarinos suffered in conse
quence, and when adversity came he
lound his safe filled with tags, bat no
money.
A mixed crowd visited the Sparta, and
a morning paper accusea Camarinos of
being at tbe head of a gang of people who
were violating the revenue laws. He
brought suit for $20,000 damages, and the
expose which followed caused him to drop
the suit. His business fell away and he
was sued and attached until he finally
went into bankruptcy.
Illness came on top of all these troubles,
and but for his younger brother in Hawaii
the prince of good lellows would have to
loo* for assistance from strangers.
Dr. B. de Marville operated on the ex-
Consul in June last, removing a virulent
cancer from nis groin. While the Datient
,has been progressing fairly well his life
still hangs in the balance.
KING CASE COMPROMISED.
The Property of the Eccentric Mission
Cooper Soon to Be distributed.
The contest over the property left by
"Barrel" King, the eccentric Mission
cooper, who in 1894 died in an insane asy
lum, has been compromised.
King, whose given name was Cornelias,
left an estate consisting of money in bank,
amounting to over $200,000. He made a
will leaving his entire property to the
children of his brother, of whom there
were four â Cornelius, Mary, James and
Daniel. The niece, Mary, died before the
testator, leaving no issue. Nephew Cor
nelius also died, but left four children â
Mary, Cornelius Jr., James and Valentine.
The will was contested by a small army
of other brothers, sisters, nephews and
nieces, who claimed that King was insane
when he drew up his last testament. The
matter haa taken up a considerable por
tion of Judge Coffey's time for more than
a year past, but yesterday a compromise
was agreed upon.
There is now in the bands of the execu
tors, James and Daniel King, who are the
principal legatees, $180,000 which can be
distributed. It was agreed between the
parties that the contest would be settled
by giving $80,000 to the contestants and
$100,000 to the legatees under the will.
By this agreement James and Daniel
King, who have already received $10,000
each, will get an additional $31,333 33
each. The children of their brother Cor
nelius. who reside in New York and are
named Mary, Cornelius Jr., James and
Valentine, get $9333 33 each. Mary Ma
chaao will receive $22,916 66.
Florence Carey King gets $18,750 and
Florence Carey King Jr. $4583 34. Kate
Riordan, Michael King, Daniel King and
Dennis King, children of Michael King
Br., get- $3750 each. John, Cornelius,
Jerry, Daniel, Michael and James Sulli
van, Mary Warren and Kate Whooley,
children of Catherine Sullivan, get $2343 75
each.
The order for partial distribution is
drawn up and will be presented to Judge
toffey for his signature to-day.
AN INCREASE OF HOURS.
The County Clerk's and Sheriff* Offices
Will Hereafter Be Open
VntH 5 P. M.
There is a settled gloom In the County
Clerk's office. Attendants who were once
most blithe and obliging now go about
with downcast eyes and sullen mem.
Since yesterday at 9 a. m. pounds of flesh
have been lost by the different employes
of Mr. Curry and buckets of tears have
been shed. The reason for all the sadness
is that yesterday the county government
bill want into effect ana one of its pro
visions makes it necessary to keep the
County Clerk's office open until 5 p. m.
Heretofore its doors have closed at 4.
The new rule only exemplifies the old
ada c that there is no rose without an ac
companying thorn. On Wednesday the
men who are now the chief mourners were
leaders in the jubilation that resulted
when the Supreme Court handed down its
decision that Mr. Curry is entitled to a
four-year term. Being assured of their
tenure of office they are now wailing over
the additional hour they will have to
labor each day.
The Sheriff's office is subject to the
same rule as the County Clerk's office and
hereafter it will remain open until 5 p. m.
McKENNA WAS ABSENT,
The U. S. Circuit Judge Fails
to Answer a Justice
Summons.
A R quest for the Citation of the
Non-Appearlng Federal Officer
Is Refused.
Yesterday a State Justice Court awaited
in vain tbe appearance of a United States
Circuit Court, and wnen the latier came
not the former closed it doors and went
home.
It is not often that one court gets itself
in the odor of contempt with another, and
the spectacle is an interesting one. The
alleged offender is no less a personage
than Judge McKenna, and he is said to
have set at naught the order of Justice of
the Peace Groezinger.
Recently a suit was tried in Groezinger's
court, in which Eugenia de Mauvron was
given a verdict against Miss Kate Mc-
Kenna, sister of Juage McKenna, in the
sum of $175 for services rendered. The de
fendant failed to pay the money in accord
ance with the judgment, and the United
States Circuit Judge and his brother were
summoned to appear before the Justice
Court and testify at to their sister's
finances.
When his Honor of the Circuit Court
failed to appear the attorney for the
plaintiff requested that Judge McKenna
be cited to show cause why he should not
be punished for contempt, and that a war
runt be issued for his appearance. This
Justice Groezinger refused to do, statin e
that he knew Judge McKenna to be a
person possessing every respect for the
order of any court, and that there must be
some good and valid reason for his non
appearance. The case was then continuea,
tbe court stating that the ju licial witness
would doubtless explain satisfactorily the
cause of his absence. Plaintiff's counsel
protested and raised the question as to
whether a Federal Judge in his court,
which is a United States reservation, is
out of a State court's reach, should he
choose to avail himself of that privilege.
Hudelaon's Trial.
It la probable that an application will be
made to-day by Benjamin F. Hudelson for a
change of venue ot nis case to Oakland. Reel
B. Terry said yesterday that Hudelson is enti
tled to sach change, and that it will probably
be granted.
Criminal Proceeding*.
Arthur Arlington was yesterday acquitted
of a charge of forgery in Judge Wallace's court
Luke Gaffney was found guilty of assault with
a deadly weapon, He will be sentenced to-day.
KEW TO-DAY.
The Fall Styles
In Men's attire are examples of high art and
good taste. We make to order garments that
would find favor and admiration on the streets of
London or the boulevards of Paris.
Why are you paying $25 to $40 to tailors for
suits when we make better garments to order for
$10 to $20 ? We do everything on a wholesale
scale ; five stores, over 200 employes, ten times
the business of the average tailor. Any wonder
we can make clothes for half his prices ?

When Bryan Spoke in
Madison Square.
HARRISON AND COCKRAN.
New York Estimated to B? for Me-
Kinley by a Majority of
200,000.
H. H. Vreeiand, president of the New
York Traction Company, employing 8000
men, and the Whitney-Wiedner-Eikins
Company, controlling the leading street
railway properties east ol Chicago, which
employ 25,000 men, is at the Palace.
Mr. Vreeland haÂ« come to California for
the first time. His object is to examine
into the cable and electric roads of the
coast and especially of San Francisco. He
is a large man, apparently only a little over
40 years of age, and used to be a railroad
conductor. Thus he is a self-made man,
and is several times a millionaire.
The gentleman is an ardent supporter of
Major McKinley and says he has no doubt
from what he knows of the East and has
seen of the West that McKinley will be
elected.
He says that at tbe time of the nomina
tion of Bryan things were very unsettled
in New York. It could not then be told
how the wave tbat was supposed to be roll
ing eastward from the West ana South
would leave things when it got into the
Empire Stute. But afier Bryan had made
his aadress in Madison Square the end
came. Business began to settle in its
accustomed grooves and stocks rose a few
points. Ever since then things have been
straightening out.
When President Harrison made his
great speech in Carnegie Hall there was
such a crowd that it he could have had a
hou^e covering three blocks it would have
been completely tilled. The sreech set
things right, and the effect could be
noticed at once. The people began to feel
that the National contest would be settled
rieht
A little later when Bourke Cockran
made his eloquent address people realized
more than ever that McKinley was to be
the next President.
"I estimate that he will carry New York
by 200,000," said Mr. Vreeland. "As for
Illinois, where I was for a few days on
my way here, I would not like to make
an estimate, but feel that he will carry
that State.
"Wuerever I went I found the McKin
ley sentiment growing. The peoplr want
sound money and an honest dollar. I
talked with c, good many different crews
of railway men and I found without ex
ception that they were in favor of Me-
Kinley. The railroad men, I know from
nay own experience, are pretty e;ood judges
of what is going to occur. They see ana
talk to a great many people and have a
campaign pretty well sized up.
"Among an I saw 1 did not find any
who were not also enthusiastic In their
support of Mr. McKinley. In fact among
all classes, when you get above men who
work merely with their hands and do not
drink, they were for an honest dollar.
Take the intelligent artisans and workers
of other classes wno mix ideas with their
work, and they are all for the nominee of
tbe Republican National Convention."
Mr. Vreeland has had a remarkably suc
cessful career. He is known, not only
over the United States and Canada, but
throughout the world as one of th- great
est of common carriers. His cable sys
tem alone in New York, which extends
over seventeen miles, carries over 300,000
people every twenty-iour hour-. The sys
tem of street railroads in cities east* of
Chicago which he controls carry millions
of people every day.

CATHOLIC KNIGHTS
Father Yorke's Spirited
Address in Metropoli
tan Temple.
AIMS OF THE SOCIETY.
It Has Paid $7,000,000 in Bene
fits Since Its Organi
zation.
NO LITIGATED DEATH CLAIMS.
An Organization Whose Charity Is
Always Ready and Uni
versal.
A musical and literary entertainment
and a lecture by Rev. Father P. C. Yorke
were given last evening at Metropolitan
Temple under the auspices of the Catholic
Knights of America. The letters of red
and gold, peculiar to tbe temple, por
trayed across the front of the pipe organ
the vords in glittering characters, "Cath
olic Knigats."
If the temple bad been a theater playing
a popular drama the legend "standing
room only" ought to have been displayed
at the main entrance before 8 o'clock.
Every chair in the temple was taken,
people crowded the side and rear aisles,
and the terraces of steps in the gallery
were improvised as seats.
A. J. McMahon was chairman. He
made a brief speech, and introduced each
feature of the programme. He spoke of
the founding of the organization of the
Catholic Knights of America in 1877, and
stated that on four different occasions the
society bad received the blessing of tbe
Pope. He stated that 1700 of the regular
Roman Catholic clergy curry a certificate
in tbe order; tbat the order bad paid
$7,000,000 in benefits since its organiza
zation, $162,000 in San Francisco, and had
never litigated a single death claim.
In his opening remarks Father Yorke
referred to the colors of red and w iie in
which the hall was ornamented. He said
he did not know just what they meant at
first. He thought they might refer to free
silver and the Roman right hand until he
heard that they were the remnants of a
recent free-silver meeting, lie thought at
first that they might be a delicate com
pliment to the blood which has been seen
"in the moon out on Valencia street."
The subject of Father Yorke's address
was "Tbe Catholic Knight's of America.*'
He said substantially:
"You know this is an age of organiza
tion. Men and women have gone into so
cieties in order to advance their interests.
If we look in the social or political world
we find anything that it is uorth doing at
all is done by organization. We find the
Catholic church is not behind the times in
this. She is progressive in the matter of
organizations. She is for this world as
well as for the next. She wishes her chil
dren not only to be abreast of the times,
but to be ahead of the times.
"If there is one virtue needed by men,
youngandold.it is the virtue of stead
fastness and nru'lence. No nan is abso
lutely alone in the world. It is his duty
to see that there is before him such com
fort as <* modest provision wquld give. It
Is not humane or Christian to leave pos
terity in want. No man has a right to
brine children into the world unless he
provides for them.
"Th^idea of the family Is that it is
something continuous. Unfortunately in
our day the family seems to be only a
name. That iv fact is not the case. Tbe
head of tbe family should see and provide
that if he be taken away tbe family will
live in peace and comfort afterward. Few,
however, do this.
"There are a large number of million
aires, but no one cares to inquire too
carefully how they got their money.
Men should strive to provide for those
that come after them. Societies which
loot after the widow and the children
after the head of the family is away are,
to my mind, one of the best features of
our civilization. The Catholic Knights of
America seek to be such a society and to
preserve that Christian institution, the
Christian home.
"Can you imagine how much comfort
has been given by $7,000,000 paid to bene
ficiaries since 1877? It was not given as a
charity, but given as a right. [Applause.]
"One of the objects of this meeting is to
brine before Catholic men the objects of
this society. . We should be prepared for
both riches and poverty. It would be well
for young men starting out in the battle
of life to remember that the future has
claims and that wife and children
should not be left to cold charity. It is
your duty to insure yourself with benefit
societies, so that if you are taken away
something may be left to those who are
dependent upon you.
"Theee societies have their spiritual and
intellectual Rood as well. The day has
passed when Catholics need to apologize
for organizing as Catnolics. Men know
that in this City we are in the majority,
but defenseless.
"There is a necessity for Catholics or
ganizing, but not on political lines, thank
God. But we want no man to understand
that he can override us, because we are of
a religion that is guaranteed us by the
constitution. Two years ago strangers
came out of the woods and declared that
Catholics were not loyal. Was there a
paper in San Francisco that came to your
defence? No. If your rights are worth
having they are worth .fighting for. It is
the duty of Catholics to stand together
for their rights."
It was announced that the next lecture
tinder the auspices of the Ladies' Liberal
League would be given September 21, in
stead of September 28. The literary and
musical programme rendered was well
appreciated,. and called forth much ap
plause. _ _^___________
WITH BABE KNUCKLES.
Two Young Men Fight a Des
perate Battle in the
Mission.
Twenty-Eight Bloody Rounds in a
Local Clubroomâ The Result
a Draw.
It took twenty-eight rounds of desperate
bare knuckle slogging early yesterday
moraine to settle a grudge that has
existed for a long time between Jimmy
Brit, once champion bantam-weight of the
coast, and Frank Lawlor, another well
known athlete whose doings in the fistic
arena have made him quite prominent.
Britt Â»nd Lawlor were formerly friends,
but bad a falling-out, some say, over a
member of the fair sex, and their greet
ings have recently been very frigid when
they met. Recently it came to the ears of
on* or the men that the other was making
desparazine remarks about his abilities as
a boxer, and a challenge to fight to a
finish with bare fasts was the result. Both
men are members of a well-known athletic
club in the Mission that has turned out a
great many S uod boxers, and on the
challenge being accepted it was decided to
hold the match there.
The location of the rine was kept an
absolute secret until the last minute, and
while the fighters were in training no one
except a favored few knew where the mill
wus to take place.
It was shortly after midnight yesterday
morning when the men were called into
the ring by the referee, a well-known
sporting man. Both men were in a con
dition that promised a long and desperate
engagement. The men were ready and
willine, and tbe effect of tbe fierce rallies
in which they engaged soon began to show
on their faces.
Lawlor'a lips began to look puffy before
the end of the third ,round, and be was a
little more cautious as he stepped about
Britt.
From the third to the twelfth round the
fighting was fast, but both men had bel
lows to mend and they took things easier
until the twentieth round, when another
tierce rally nearly resulted in Britt going
out from a right-hand swing that landed
on his neck.
He recovered in the next round, and
from that to the twenty-eighth round he
had a shade the best of the argument,
Lawlor being tired.
As there seemed to be little chance of a
finish beirtg seen for many rounds to come
and as both men were terribly punished,
thereferee called the match a draw. Both
will be confined to the house for days be
fore their faces will b ; presentable.

FOUND DEAD ON THE SOFA
Achille Waldteufel Passes
Away Under Most Peculiar
Circumstances.
The Gas Turned On, but It Is Be
lieved to Have Been the Result
of an Accident.
Acbllle Waldteufel, general manager of
the Catholic Art and Book Company, 723
Market street, was found dead in tbe par
lor of bis home, 414 Van Ness avenue t
yesterday morning. The deceased was
lying on the sofa when discovered. One
of the gas jets was turned on in full force,
the doors and windows tightly closed, in
dicating suicide, though the family pro
tests that death was the result of accident.
"It could not have been suicide," said
Mrs. Waldteufel. "There was no reason
why he should do such a thing. lam
sure it was the result of an accident."
Further than this the family do not care
to talk. This relicence has probably given
rise to the suicide theory.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Wood, who
rents the upper flat of 414 Van Ness
avenue to the Waldteufels, perceived a
strong odor of gas. She traced the odor
to the front parlor, which is used exclu
sively by her tenants. She called her son
and the two proceeded into the room. On
the sofa lay Mr. Waldteufel apparently
asleep.
Young Wood first found the jet from
which the gas was flowing, and stopping
that hastily opened all the doors and win
dows. Dr. Mattuer, who lives near by,
was hastily summoned, and as &oon as He
saw the man pronounced him dead. Just
when death occurred is not Known, though
the body was warm when found.
Deputy Coroners Smith and Hallett
were called, but were unable to learn
whether death was the result of suicide
or of accident.
Mr. Waldteufel has not been well for a
long time, asthma being the particular
trouble. For the last four nights be has
slept on the parlor sofa. Last night he
was lyine on the &ofa when his wife re
tired at 9 o clock. He was reading a news-
Eaper at the time, and it is presumed that
nally becoming sleepy, he attempted to
turn off the gas, but only partially suc
ceeded.
It is said that the business in which Mr.
Waldteufel was engaged has not been very
prosperous of late, though this is not
given as any reason why lie should com
mit suicide. Recently he La's moved from
the street floor to some rooms upstairs in
tbe History Building.
The deceased has been in the book busi
ness in this City for the last twenty years.
He was a natiye of France and about 66
years old. He leaves a wife and beveral
grown, sons_ and daughters, ail of whom
were partners in the Catholic Art and
I Book Company.
ILLEGAL FLAHING.
Many Arrests Made Within the Past
Few i ays.
The Deputy Fish Commissioners are do-
ing fine work in breaking up illicit ti?hing
in the streams of the Btate. Deputy A.W.
Wilson arrested six men ten mlies from
Modesto for catching salmon in a barbar
ous affair.
These fellows had a rabbit-tight wire
fence strung across the Tuolumne River.
It was &o arranged that the hsh were run
into a small wins, from which they were
tossed with pitchforks by the lawbreakers.
As this is the closed season and the. fish
were running up the river to spawn, the
fishermen were charged with catching
salmon out of season. Their cases will
come up ou Monday.
Deputy Davis landed another illegal
fisher on Wednesday at the mouth of
Montezurna Slough ior fishing in the
Ciosed salmon season. He got tbe fellow's
net. This makes the sixth net confiscated
this week in the upper bay.

DEMOCRATS
IN THE DOOR
They Must Work for Cator
for United States
Senator.
TERMS OF THE COMPACT
Mr. Cator Says He Is the Logical
Candidate of the Demo
crats.
HE REPRESENTS THE DCCTRINE
Which Is the Cornerstone of Democ
racy, and He Expects Demo
cratic Support.
It is evident that Thomas V. Cator be
lieves that be is the candidate of and de
serves and is entitled to the support of the
Democrats in his race for the United
States Senatorship. The terms of the res
olution of union agreed to by the Demo
crats and Populists of this State as a basis of
joint action seem to warrant the statement
that he has the Democrats in the door.
Mr. Cator started for Fresno last nicht.
Be *ook along a satchel well filled with
statistical and other information. He
made no secret of the fact where he was
going, and offered no coy denial that he
was on political business bent, when he
was asked by a reporter for The Call
about politics from his point of view. In
fact, be said, with every indication of farm
conviction, that he would know very soon
more about the Democratic-Populistic
union nominees for seats in the Legisla
ture than he knows now.
Expressing ttia matter briefly and in
matter-of-fact lashion, Thomas " V. Cator
started out last nipht on another of those
tours through the Bate of which more or
less has been said, and the main purposo
he had in view was to see that his political
fences were put into the best condition
possible to meet climatic vicissitudes inci
dental to the political month of Novem
ber. He said that he has been touring
some. He has talked about the United
btates Senatorship with the masses orreD
resentative members of the same. He has
considered carefully the attitude of the
Democratic leaders in this State who are
pledged under the resolution by which
fusion between the Democrats and Popu
lists was effected to help elect such mem
bers of the Legislature as are jointly nom
inated.
"I am a candidate for the United States
Senatorship as a matter of course," said
Mr. Cator, briskly, "and I am supposed to
be and am working to succeed, but I do
not want to be placed in a false position in
this matter. The Populist party has
mapped out for itself and has pursued a
different programme in reference to the
United States Senatorship from that of
the other parties. It has made its nomi
nation already for the Senatorship. It
has placed me in the position of standard
bearer in this matter. Do you not see
that I am in a different position than I
would be if I were personally seeking the
election?
"The Populists, when they nominated
me fcr United States Senator, undoubt
edly expected that I would work to the
best of my ability to cany out their views.
The terms of the union of the Popuiists
and Democrats under the resolution
adopted to effect fusion, pledged both
parties to support t c nominees for the
Legislature who are named jointly. I
have no doubt of the good faith of the
Democrats in this matter. I find that the
rank and tile of the people, Democrats
and Populists, favor my election as Sena
tor. This does not take account of the
gold Democrats, who are so few that they
count very little, and of them I have taken
little account."
"Do you mean to say, Mr. Cator, that
the resolution to effect fusion pledged tbe
Democrats to favor the election of the
nominee of the Popuiists fÂ«w the position
of United States Senator?"
"No, I do not mean to say that and do
not wish to be understood "that way. I
think you will agree that I am tbe logical
candidate for the Uuited States Senator
ship from either side of the house â Demo
cratic or Populist. So far as the Popu
list nomination is concerned, I think
that I can say that it has
been won fairly. I have worked in
tbe free silver cause six years and have
upheid the principles of the Populist
party all through. Mr. Bryan makes the
advocacy cf the free coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1 the leading issue of the
campaign. I believe in that fully. The
Senator who will be elected lrom Califor
nia should be in full sympathy with the
nominee for the Presidency of both the
Populists and the Democrats."
"Why do you think that the Democrats
will support you ior the United States
Senatorship?"
"Well, I have already said that I fand
none of thÂ« leaders are hostile. I also
find that ths rank and tile are friendly.
The terms of fusion or union, under the
resolution, took in joint action on Legis
lature, Congrfssman and President."
"But have you assurances of the sup
port, such assurance being personally re
ceived, from all the iu*ioÂ» candidates for
the Legislature who have been named?"
Mr. Cator fenced with this question and
diplomatically answered that he had not
yet talked with all tbe nominees. "I
will soon know better how taey stand,"
he said.
"It would be interesting to know what
progress you have made in tbe interior,
Mr. Cator."
"Eh?" said Mr. Cator. "Eh, what is
that?"
"How many voters are you sure of np
to date?"
The Populist leader smiled, and into hxs
eyes came a far-away look, in which hope
aDd diplomacy seemed to be about equally
apportion- d.
"Ah, yes; I have not talked with all the
nominees, so I <io not know."
"Well, you know of some?"
Mr. Cstor smiled again, but he did not
mention any names. "I want to say once
more," he said, "that I am making this
contest because I am instructed to do so
by my party. It is the interest of the
Democratic party to secure the election of
a United States Senator who isentirelv in
sympathy with Mr. Bryan. I believe that
the union ticket will carry California. I
think that it is generally recognized that
I am the legitimate candidate."
Mr. Cator arrived at the ferry in advance
ol the time lor the boat to depart and put
in his leisure time discussing the situation
with other travelers, principally from the
interior, who had congregated at the ferry
and were awaiting to 'begin their home
ward journey. In this way he may have
collected a little more information about
the outlook.

dull bnt strong to-day. The transactions footed
up only 143.710 shares, including 38.300 Sui;ar,
20,700 St. Paul and 106.900 Manhattan. Opera
tors, who were generally arrayed on the bear side
yesterday, 1 made a complete change of front and
were moderate buyers throughout me session. At
the start the ' market ' was stimulated by more
favorable advices from London regarding the
political situation in t.e East and by the an
nouncement that the governors of the Bank of
England had not advanc-td the rate of discount
after all. Near the close it was rumored thai
Lazard Freres hurt engaged a big block of go.d

stocks The former advanced from 81% to 8534.
The rise is attributed to coverings Of a long out

DOCTOR McLEAN'S '
SUCCESSOR DUE,
The Rev. Charles Reynolds
Brown a Stranger to
His Flock.
WAS LATELY MARRIED.
Starting in Life as a Lawyer,
He Felt Himself Called to
the Ministry.
WORKED THROUGH BEMINARY
After a Short Methodist Experience
He Was Ordained a Congrega
tional Minister.
Oakland Office San Feancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 17. )
Although the Rev. Charles R. Brown is
to become permanent pastor of the First
REV. CHARLES REYNOLDS BROWN of CKarlestown, Mass^
"Who Will Come to QaklancJ Immediately After His Wed
ding to Succeed Rev. J. K. McLean, D.D.
Congregational Church in two weeks, not
one of the vast membership of his influ
ential pastorate has seen him either per
sonally or pictorially. Ail that is known
of him is that he is an accomplished
preacher who has accepted the unanimous
call of the congregation and has resigned
Irom his Charlestown church, near Boston.
The successor to Dr. J. K. McLean will
come to this city under very interesting
circumstances.
The trip will in reality be his honey
moon, as he will leave the day after his
marriage. The wedding will take place in
the Winthrop Church, of which he has
been pastor for four years next Wednes
day. Ihe bride is Miss Alice Tufts, who
has lived all her life in Charlestown acd
who is beloved and respected by her vast
acquaintance. She comes of the old Tufts
family of New England that founded
Tufts College, near -Boston. Her father is
treasurer of the Warren Bank, and Miss
Tufts is,a graduate of Radcliffe College.
Thursday next, Mr. and Mrs. Brown
â will leave Boston and will reach Oakland
in time for the pastor to occupy his new
pulpit on the first Sunday in October.
Rev. Charles Reynolds Brown is a native
of West Virginia and is now thirty-fonr
years of age. He graduated from Wash
ington (Iowa) College and was awarded
the degree of A. B. at lowa University in
1883. â¢
During his course at the university he
began the study of shorthand. In De
cember, 18S3, he removed to Davenport,
lowa, where he entered the law offices of
Davidson & Lane.
In the Bummer of 1885 he abandoned
law and entered an insurancs company's
office in Dcs Moines, in order that he
might save money to carry him through
the seminary. In September, 1886, he en
tered the theological school of Boston
University and on the day after he deliv
ered his graduating address he was ap
pointed pastor of Wesley Chapel M. E.
Church in Cincinnati.
There he remained until 1892, when he
abandoned Methodism, accepted the call
of Winthrop Church, Charlestown dis
trict. Bnd on September 20, 1892, was or
dained as a Congregational minister and
installed as pastor. He has done great
work while there, and has established an
excellent reputation for himself as pastor
and preacher. The congregation steadily
increased during his ministry, and his
helpful influence in the community was
appreciated by all classes of citizens.
During his lour years at Charlestown
Mr. Brown received 221 new members into
his church, and the firm place he held in
the hearts of his congregation is evidenced
by their genuine sorrow at his resignation.
In a letter from a member of Rev. C. R.
Brown's congregation at Winthrop
Church, received to-day, occurs the fol
lowins *
"A thunderbolt from a clear sky would
have caused but little more surprise to the
congregation of Winthrop Church last
Sunday than the announcement by Rev.
Charles R. Brown, the brilliant and es
teemed young pastor, that he intended to
tever his connection with the church
wherin he was ordained four years ago
and with whose people he has labored
earnestly and faithfully ever since.
"After the refusal of the generous call
which Rev. Mr. Brown received from a
Maiden congregation a year or more ago,
the majority of his people were inclined
to the opinion that he would serve in the
local ministry for some time to come.
"Mr. Brovrn is not one who jumps
hastily at any straw which may blow his
way. He readily appreciates the value of
friendly counsel and how to put it to good
personal use. It was, therefore, after due
donsideration and mature reflection that
be decided to accept a call to the First
Congregational Church of Oakland, Cal.,
which is the largest church on the Pacific
Slope, and ranks seventh in the large
churches of the Congregational denomina
tion. Although in receipt of the call
some little time, and being present in per
son at tbe regular Friday nis:ht meeting,
he did not consider it best to make any
announcement of the fact until Sunday,
| and in consequence the surprise to the
congregation was all the more complete.
"There was no attempt at a dramatic
parting in the reading of the letter. It
was a clear, straightforward statement of
his position and his intentions, full of sin
cere and affectionate regard for his people
and showing great sadness at his neces
sary departure for other fields of labor. It
was evident that it was a hard task to him
to read the letter, because of the pleasant
relations which have always existed bs
tween him and the people of Winthrop
Church, yet there was happiness underly
ing all sentiment in the fact that he was
going to greater vineyards where an op-
Eortunity for greater work was before
im. There was an absolute hush through
out the church during the reading of the
letter, and it was apparent that all were
eagerly listening to every word."
ro Appeal Again.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept 17.â The sen-
tencing of C. R. Bennett was continued
until Monday by Judge Ogden to-day, on
motion of Bennett's attorneys. His coun
sel stated that they would appeal the case
to the Supreme Court upon exceptions to
rulings made during the trial. The recent
decision was upon an appeal of the prose
cution from the setting aside of a verdict.
DR. TRENOR DROPS DEAD
Heart Disease Takes Off One
of Alameda's Oldest
Physicians.
Mrs. G. A. Weise Loses Her Jewelry.
* The Dawn Goes on a Cruise,
A Firrman Honored
ALAMEDA, Cal.,. Sept. 17.â Dr. Eus
tace Trenor, one of the oldest and best
known physicians of this city, died sud
-1 denly at 2 o'clock this afternoon at his
i home, 1312 Oak street, of heart disease,
j superinduced by an attack of pneumonia.
I He had been conversing with his wife,
when he suddenly sank down and died.
The doctor came here from New York
City in 1801, and built up a good practice.
He (inducted a private insane asylum in
j conjunction with Dr. Tucker. It was lo
j cated on the lot in the rear of the present
Park Row. About twenty years ago the
place burned and was never rebuilt. He re
sumed his private practice and continued
up to within a short time of his death.
He bad been ailing for some time, but
death was unexpected.
Dr. Trenor was born in New Yor* City
in 1834, and was of a family of five boys,
all of whom, with their father, were
members of the noted Seventh Regiment
.New York Volunteers. Soon after com
ing here he enlisted in the Twelfth In
fantry and was detailed as assistant sur
geon, which position he filled with credit
for five years. He was at Fort Grant and
Fort Tucson during this time. He then
settled here, it being in 1867,
The deceased leaves a daughter, Mrs.
McAllister, and a widow, both of whom
were with him at the last. He was form
erly a member of the Salvation Army, but
cast his lot with the American Volunteers
some time ago. The funeral services will
be bela from the latter's headquarters in
San Francisco next Sunday afternoon.
Captain Mills of the Oakland Post was
present at the doctor's deathbed.
Pioneer Fireman Honored.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 17.â During
the after-dinner speeches last night at the
banquet of the Citizens' Hook and Ladder
Company No. 1, P. W. Barton, its first fore
man, was presented with a handsome
gold bad^e, set with diamonds and rubies.
It is in the .share o f a fire front of a fire
man's helmet, with the figure lon the
face. The lettering reads: "First Fore
man Citizen H. and L., P. W. B." On the
back is the following inscription: "1876.
A token of esteem from Citizen H. and L
Co., No. 1, A. F. 1)., P. W. Barton their
First Foreman. 1896." The presentation

surprise.

ON PINS AND NEEDLES,
Not a Single Candidate Is Cer
tain of a Republican
Nomination.
Mount Eden Will Open Her Big Wig
wam With a Barbecue, a Meet
ing and a Ball.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
903 Broadway, Sept. 17. j
So complex are the positions of the many
candidates for the Republican nomina
tions at Monday's convention that no one
can, at this time, assert that his position
is secure. On account of the conflicting
boundaries of the Supervisorial, Assembly
and Senatorial districts, it is almost im
possible to make a trade and to guarantee
that any delegation will stay traded. Tbere
will be three tickets in the field in nearly
every district at Saturday's primary, and
when the results are known candidates
will have to rush to and fro like the wind
all Sunday to make new combinations
ready for the convention which assembles
in Lindemann Hall, Alameda, on Monday.
The latest feature in the fight for
Superior Judces is the coming to the front
of Judgo J. J. Allen. When elected Jus
tice of the Peace two years ago, Judge
Allen received the largest vote of any
Justice, and he is still as popular. He lias
not yet completed the combination he will
enter. He says that his ticket will be for
the Third Ward candidates who have not
rallied to the Greene-Hall ticket, but he
will not mix up in the Senatorial fight.
Supervisor Pelouze announced to-day
that he will run independently to succeed
himself.
MOUNT EDEN, Cal., Bept. 17 The
Republicans of Mount Eden and vicinity
are preparing for a big time Saturday
afternoon and evening, when the new
wigwam of the Mount Eden Republican
Club will be formally dedicated to the
cause espoused by McKinley and Hobart.
The Brat of the exercises will commence
at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when a big
meeting will be held in the new building.
A fine programme has been prepared, in
cluding speeches and music, while other
features will entertain.
At the meeting C. M. Shortridge and
Congressman 6. G. Hilbqrn will each de
liver an address on the issues of the cam
paisrn, and local orators will also be heard.
During the afternoon a regular old-fash
ioned barbecue will take place, and this
will particularly interest the country
people.
In the evening a dedicatory ball will be
given, which promises to be largely at
tended.
The wigwam, which is an imposing
structure, is to be gayly adorned with ban
ners and bunting, and will undoubtedly
be the scene of more real Republican en
thusiasm than has been known of in Mt.
Eden's history.
SUFFRAGISTS SPEAK.
A Large Audience Hears Women Argue
for Their I'.ighU.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 17.â The Expo
sition building held an enthusiastic audi
ence of fully 2500 people to-night to par
ticipate in the tirst distinctive suffragist
rally and mass-meeting held in this city
during the campaign. The stage was
beautifully decorated with the National
emblems, palms, fern 3, cut flowers and
smilax. Mrs. Lloyd Baldwin, president
of the Alameda County Political Equality
Society, presided and was surrounded by
a hundred or more of the most prominent
men and women ot the city. Among the
number were Rev. C. W. Wendte, Miss
iMollie Connors, editorof Saturday Night;
Mrs. A. A. Moore, Mrs. Olive Clifford,
Mrs. Ida A. Harper, Mr-. Nellie Holbrook-
Biinn and Miss Winifred harper.
The first speaker was Mrs. Carrie Chap
man-Catt, who began by giving a review
of the condition of women from the fourth
century down to the present time, and de
clared that men had advanced during all
these years, and that women had ad
vanced also, though they had been kept
behind by men. With the close of the
nineteenth century they desired to ask to
be allowed to take their places beside
the ir brothers and make the world what
it should be. She said' that the only rea
son women had not been enfranchised
long ago was because the political parties
and politicians hail not been satisfied that
they would benefit their special party. In
support of this she Quoted the fact that no
Territory had ever been admitted to state
hood until known that it would support
the party in power at the time and assist
to keep it in power.
Rev. Anna Shaw, the other speaker, has
been here on several occasions, and was
warmly greeted when she faced the au
dience. She reviewed the situation as she
found it in the State. "The most danger
ous class," she said, "is the wily, unscrup
ulous politician, with money to buy the
votes of the ignorant class. Their power
is more to be feared than that oi any other
class in the land."
Observed a Jewish Holiday.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 17.â Judge Ells
worth observed the "Day of Atonement"
to-day out of respect to several j'irors of
the Hebrew faith who were listening tn
the testimony in the case of Caiharina
Moir aea!nst the Southern Pacific Rail
road. Two years ago a juror asked for a
vacation at this time and was refused, and
on the next day he died.
UNCLE SAM'S
LONG-HIED BOY
Lyman P. Baare Is a Post
man Who Believes With
Samson.
STRENGTH IN HIS HAIR
He Lost Three Days' Pay Rather
Than Remove His Hat in
the Office.
REASON FOR HIS BELIEF.
Since Allowing His Locks to Grow
Baare's Physical Development Has
Been Very Rapid.
Oakland Office San Frakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 17. Â»
A most novel proposition has been made
to Postmaster White by Captain Harry
Williams of the Oakland Cycling CluD.
Wiliiams is a barber, and he has offered to
LETTER-CARRIER BARRE, Who Lost Three Days' Pay Rather
Than Expose the Top of His Head.
cut the hair, shampoo and shave Letter
carrier Lyman P. Baare, it the latter will
consent. Bat Mr. Baare will not even
take off his hat, and il is highly danger
ous to any one to suggest hair-cutting to
him.
Baare has been the most notable char
acter in the Oakland civil service for
some years. His peculiarity consists of
his long hair, which he will not cut and
which he claims is the secret of his pres
ent good health. Baare's hair is long
enough to cover his shoulders and he ap
pears strangely out of place among such a
trim body of men as there is in the letter
carrier service.
Some time ago Baare lost three days'
pay rattier than take his hat off while at
tending the delivery-window on Sunday.
The clerk in charge saw Baare with his
bat on handing letters to ladies through
the window and told him it was not the
proper thing. Baare persisted and was
laid off that day, and when the matter
was reported to the Postmaster Bnare was
laid off for two more days, and ail because
he would not take his hat off. No one
ever remembers seeing Baare with his hat
off.
A few years ago Lyman Baare was in
Door health when compared with his
rooust constitution at this time. He ex
plained recently to a friend that the secret
of the change was in his hair. He said
that he believed in the story of Samson
and is of the opinion that long hair is con
ducive to health and strength. Since let
ting his hair grow Baare claims that his
physique has wonderfully improved, and
bin appearance certainly bears out his
claim, as he is a finely developed man.
Postmaster White denied that he was
trying to get some authority from Wash
ington to require Baare to cut his hair.
"I am thinking of no such ridiculous
thing," said the postmaster to-day. "I
I cannot force a man to cut his hair. All
I can do Is to insist that every man shall
present a neat, respectable appearance and
I can co no further.' 1
Baare is a very reticent young man ana
his long locks have made him very promi
nent. He ties his hair with a narrow rib
bon at the back of his neck and owing to
the notoriety which he has obtained on
account of his peculiarity he has been in
duced to place it on the top of his head
bo that it is covered by his hat.
OFFICERS IN DOUBT.
Snpreme Court Decision May Hake It
Necessary to Elect Jus
tices.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 17.â The gen
eral impression among the legal fraternity
in this city is that the decision of the
Supreme Court regarding the term of
offices in Ban Francisco has vacated the
term of City Justices J. J. Allen and T. V.
Wood at the end of this year, and that as
a consequence there must be nominations
made at the coming county conventions.
The Supervisors will undoubtedly in
clude in the call for the general election
the City Justices, and this will give the
fcocumbents the opportunity to bring in
junction proceedings to prevent the
names from being placed on the ticket.
Id case this is not done those nominated
at the conventions or those who choose to
run independently would bring suit to
have their names placed on the ticket.
The Superior Court would pass on the
issue in time for election, but it would
then go to the Supreme Court.
Palmer's Return.
OAKLAND. Cal., Sept. 17.â The Rev.
S. S. Palmer, pastor of the Brooklyn Pres
byterian Church in East Oakland, has re
turned from a two months' vacation in
Honolulu. While absent he supplied the
Central Union Church of that city. He
was fortunate enough to see the great vol
cano in action, feel the eartn tremble and
see the molten lava spurting out in balls
of fire and then fall back again into the
seething mass below.
The Central Union Church of Honolulu
is built from the same plans as Mr. Pal
mer's church in this city. It is considered
a model in architecture and internal ar
rangements. It is a beautiful structure of
lava atones and cost $135,000.
Democrats Indifferent.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 17.â The Demo
I cratic primaries last night in this city
were the quietest ever held. In some
places not a dozen votes were cast. There
was no contest worthy the name, and as it
had been given out that the Populists
j were to have half of the nominations few
j felt impelled to take the trouble to hunt
up the polling-places and cast a ballot.
SAVED THE DUMMY.
But Had It Been a Human l'.ody It
Would. Have Been the
Same.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 17.â The test of
streetcar fenders to-day on Washington
street attracted quite a crowd, among
which Mayor Davie and several Council
men appeared, as well as streetcar men
and others Interested.
George Risen Mailer, the Ban Francisco
inventor, has a framework with a rope
net which would pick up anything from a
cat to a horse and buggy. It is so ar
ranged that if a prostrate body is hit the
net is lilted so as to pass over it, but in so
doing a smaller apron under the car is
dropped and scoops up the body. It is
an impossibility for a body to cet under
the wheels with this apparatus in use.
The scoop was set in to-day's trials for a
track that is above the street level, as in
suburban traffic, it having been tried at
Elrahurst, In the city, where the pave
ment is level with the rail, it has to be set
a couple of inches higher to correspond to
the difference to the street level, the first
apron necessarily being nigh enough so as
to only touch n prostrate body slightly
and not to roll it.
All who saw the trial expressed the be
lief that a life-saving guard had been in
vented that would save life. Its appear
ance is not what might be desired, but
this in a second consideration, and might
be easily remedied by the inventor with
out any loss of effectiveness in preventing
the mangling of persons who tire caujjbrt
by the cable and electric cars.

in a bottle he took with him. His friends
have calculated that Mr. Dutton took just
a trifle less than a dime a day from be
neath the snow, and although the returned
artist still refers to the "good prospects"
in the northland, it is not thought that
there will be another exodus from Oakland
next sprinc.
"If the Government does not send a
revenue cutter up north to brine: back
some of tbe .stranded gold-hunters'," said
Mr. Dutton to-day, "there will b? great
suffering this winter. I took up enough
food to last me all summer, and although
provisions are not more than four prices,
there are several people who are dependent
on charity, with no prospect of earning
their fare home."
It is said that Mr. Dutton did not fare
even aa well as he reported. His refusal to
take the cork out led to the jocular rumor
that the gold dust was filed, from one of
the "gold" bricks that haveJJJ figured so
prominently in recent criminal proceed
ings in this city.
WANTS TO RUN AGAIN.
Theodorianitis, the Aged Greek
Sprinter, Ready for a
Match.
Important Viticulturai Experiments.
Organizing a Free Silver
Club.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 17.â Nikoloas
Thecdorianitis, the sturdy old Greek, who
ran eight miles in 64 minutes last Sunday
over the rough road from Ban Pablo to
Berkeley, as told in The Call, wants to
make another run. But the next time he
dons his running garb it will be in a con
test for a purse. He ran, or rather walked
and ran, alone last Sunday, unpaced, with
no particular object in view further than
to limber up his legs and get back big
wind.
The hardy veteran Macedonian Is look
ing for a man about 50 years of asre to run
against, notwithstanding the fact that he
himself is in his seventy-seventh year.
This race must be a time race. That is,
the man who covers the greatest distance
in the same period of time takes the laurel
wreath and the purse.
Tneodorianitis says that he can do
nothing in a short race, but that his
strength lies in his ability to run for ten
hours, or even ten days. What he pro
poses is a race for ten or fifteen hours over
some country road in the vicinity. 'He is
not particular whether it be hilly or as
smooth as a barn floor, so long as his
opponent has to run over the same course.
The run which the old Greek took last
Sunday was his first since winning the
championship of Greece on the stadium
in 1890. He has taken long jaunts into
the country recently and has made some
remarkably pood time considering his age
and lack of training. Parties in Berkeley
who know of his record last Sunday are
considering a proposition of putting up
$500 on the Greek in a long-distance race.
They are having Theodorianitis practice
dally with the view to getting into trim
for a tryout.
Tbere is talk of having him enter in a
race from San Francisco to Lios Angeles.
The aged sprinter has several times ex
pressed his desire to run that distance for
a consideration.
Vineyard Experiments.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Sept. 17.âIn
structor Hayne and Mr. Bioietti of the
department of viticulture at the State
University will leave to-morrow to con
duct a series of wine experiments at the
Niitoma vineyard in Napa County.
They will tafce along a quantity of bac
teria for fermenting purposes, and will
employ a cooling machine for adjusting
the temperature of wines, which was in
vented by Mr. Hayne. The general pur
pose of the experiments is to find means
for making dry wines in climates where it
is now impossible to do so. The depart
ment expects during the present season to
make some very important improvements
over present methods of wine-making.
San Francisco's Milk Supply.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 17.â Professor
E. J. "JVickson of the department of agri
culture at the State University is engaged
in the preparation of an extensive sta
tistical report of the milk trade
of San Francisco for the Jnited
States Bureau of Agriculture. The pro
lessor is receiving data for the completion
of this report by means of schedules sent
to the leading dairymen of the country
who dispose of their product in San Fran
cisco. These replies, of which about fifty
have already been received, are being com
piled in narrative form.
Free Silver Club Formed.
BERKELEY, Gal., Sept. 17.â The Pop
ulists and Democrats of Berkeley met last
night at Pythian Hall for the purpose of
forming a Free Silver Club. A commit
tee was appointed lor the purpose of ef
fecting a fusion between local Democrats,
Poputists and Silver Republicans. The
committee consists of General Theodore
Wagner, D. H. Frye and Robert VV. Good.
The committee will act at once with the
view to establishing the Free Silver Club.
Meeting at Golden Gate.
GOLDEN GATE, Cal., Sept. 17.â A Re

THE OLYMPIAN FRACAS.
S. F. Hughes and Philip Wand Severely
Rebuked by Judge Campbell for
Their loul Language.
Samuel F. Hughes, druggist, and Philip
Wand, sprinter, both members of the
Olympic Club, appeared in Judge Camp
bell's court yesterday. Huehes was charged
by Wand with threats against life and ex
hibiting a deadly weapon.
The trouble occurred early Tuesday
morning in front of Hughes' store on Post
and Powell streets over a setter dog be
longing to Wand. The laneuage used on
theoccasion was unfa for publication.
Wand, when questioned by the Judge,
admitted that he had called Hughes a liar
and that he was not afraid of him. Charles
Moreli, who was present during the
trouble, testified that Wand made a mo
tion to strike Hughes, and it was not till
then that Hughes drew his revolver and
warned Wand to keep away. He did not
think Wand's life was in danger.
The Judge dismissed the case and said
he was a shamed* to think that fellow club
members could descend to use the lan
guage aa testified to. He thought both
Wand and Hughes ought to be ashamed
of themselves.

A laiee number of citizens recently met In con
sultation wii* the Board ot Supervisors of Madera
County to consider the advisability of submi ting
to the voters of the county a proposition to issue

District Attorney Miles \Ya;lace expressed the

James 11. Bacon of the Bank ot salt Lake and
First Bank of Men 11 r has made an offer of sett.e
metit 10 tue creditors of tne bank. He offer?, with
the assistance 01 11. IL. Kea, vice-president of the
Dalton <& 1 ark Gold, Silver and Lead Mining and
Milling Company, to pay all claims against the
bank with Dalton & Lark slock at $1 per share,
less any dividends that may accrue in the mean
time, but with interest at the rate of t> percent, 'Ihe
Dalton it Lark Company Is capitalized for 82,500,
-000, and since its incorooration about eight
months ago has paid dividends to the amount of
*85,U00. They are large silver and lead producers i
i.t Uisgham. A part 01 Mr. Bacon's offer is as fol
lows:
"1 now inclose a proposition from Mr. Rea,
which only needs the acceptance of four-tifths of
my creditors In amount to make it a success, 'l he
stock will be delivered for claims when that
arrouni have accepted. At the present time it Is
Impossible to r;Â»ise cash. The report of the re- I
ceiverÃ, as pub ished, shows the 'total possible '
assets' to be worth $58,939 50, which makes, when
prorated among my creators, about 20 cents on
the do. .ar of their claims, from which, of course,
will be deducted the f- ci for receivers, their attor
neys and court and other expenses. An estimate
of these, if the matter is ;o be prolonged fora year,
would probably reduce what the creditors wUI re
ceive throuih the receivers to lo or 15 cents on
the dollar. The stock of the Dalton <& l.ark com
pany sells for 50 cents per share, aud in fairly
good times is worth far in excess of that
pi ice. It you will hold the certificate of 'stock you
Â«et of Mr. Kea tor two years. 1 will agree on the
back of it to purchase it at $1 per share, aud 10
pay therefor, on or before two years, with 6 per
cent interest, less the amount ot dividends de
clared by the Dalton <fc Lar* Guld, silver and Lead
Mining an. 1 Mi.iing company during such time. If
the storK should not be worth a dollar per share at
the end of two years, 1 will be pa. ing aiy debt to
you and to Mr. Rea bo.h; but I would rather pay
twice, if need be, than to let any one truthfully
hÂ»v 1 had not done my beau This proposition will
bÂ« open untiil September 21, 1896."

TO BUMP PHELAN
AGAINST RAINEY
Kid-Gloved Anti-Raineyites
Will Run "Jimmy"
To-Night.
BUT SAM ISN'T EXCITED.
A Night Caucus at Which the
Junta Minority Talked of
Another Struggle.
COLIN BOYD ON THE SIATE.
Rainey's Platform Snubs the W men
and Boycotts All the Buckley
Candidates.
Rainey's municipal convention "will
aSord a tug of war to-night between
James D. Phelan and Colin M. Boyct, ac
cording to the indications at midnight.
There was a caucus last night of some
of the kid glove anti-Raineyites at the
State Central Committee rooms, at which
these "kindergartners" talked their cour
age to the sticking point and decided to
give Mr. Rainey another tussle to-night.
That is very kind of them, as it will give
Rainey, Lanigan, Greaney, Maxwell and
the rest of the Mint and Fire Department
gang a little entertainment and make
their "cinch" in the convention the surer.
Rainey displayed a majority of 165 in
the convention on Tuesday evening when
C. A. Reynolds defeated Eugeue N. Deu
prey for temporary chairman. His ma
jority was largely made up of the strength
of the "anarchists" who Btoodsolialy with
him. McNab, Popper, Sullivan, Has
sett and the rest of the anti-Raineyites
threw up the sponge, quit and said noth
ing. The first gleam of hope returned to
them last night at the California Hotel
caucus. It was rigured out that enough
independent anarchists and stray votes
could be now switched from Rainey to
overcome his majority. At the caucus
were Gavin McNab, M. C. Hasaett, W. P.
Sullivan, Charles GilOea.W. J.Biggy.FranK
P. Hughes, Clltus Barbour and others.
It was officially stated that Mr. Pnelan
would accept the nomination if it were
secured for him, and it was argued that
the Non-Partisan indorsement couid prob
ably be secured for him. The game was
recognized to be worth a herculean effort,
and these people decided that unless some
of their calculations on votes should be
upset to-day Phelan' s name should be pre
sented to the convention.
The caucus had no official reports from
the stable as to what Mr. Rainey had been
doing since Tuesday night and what he
might be doing to-day.
There are no indications that the pro
gramme of the Raineyites to nominate
Colin M. Boyd will be changed. The
Raineyiies would vote for Max Popper as
quickly as they would for Mr. Puelan, the
kid-gloved aristocrat, wno carries his nose
pretty high, scorns tne "push," and wno,
they say, "would ' Roosevelt" the town if
the new charter is adopted.
It is the decision on the four-year term
question that has made possible this new
uream of bearding Sam Rainey in his own
convention. Ihe "anarchists," represent
ing about eighty votes in the conven
tion, were won by Rainey through com
binations on certain nominations
which will not now be made. John F.
McGovern, secretary of the General Com
mittee, who is a business man on Third
street of good standing and character, was
conceded ttie nomination for County Clerk
for one thing, and other promises of
place and patronage helped buy the
banded anarchists who held the balance
of power. The Supreme Court decision
wrecked these -combinations, and yester
day everybody was at sea as to what new
combinations and deals would be formed.
It was seen, however, that Rainey and Lani
Â£an had the convention anyway and that
with the prestige of the victory and his
skill at convention work, Rainey's rule of
the convention was certain. All sorts of
things may happen, but if Odd Fellows'
Hall will not be a slaughter-house for
Phelan, if his name is presented to-night,
many prophets on the 'â¢inside" are fools.
The Rainey-Lanigan people were busy
as nailers yesterday and last night, and
they are generally understood to be a
match for the kindergarten bosses of the
opposition.
Rainey's platform committee, of which
Alex T. Vogelsang is chairman, met at
the Flood building headquarters last night
and got the platform out in the rough.
One of the first planks adopted was a
strong one providing that no nominee of
the Buckleyites should be accepted. A
minority opposed this, and then some
members wanted an exception made of
the judicial nominations. Friends of Jo
seph Leggett, who is on the other ticket
for Superior Judge, of Dr. W. J. Gavigan,
who was nominated for Police Judge, and
of one or two other candidates tried hard
to get this exception made, but failed.
Another effort will be made in t..e conven
tion.

a woman-^uffrage plank, but it didn't get
a vote. The Buckleyites unqualifiedly in
dorsed the cause.
The A. P. A. and the. State Board of
Equalization were denounced, and three
pledges ior Supervisors were adopted.
One was a highiy revolutionary one; re
quiring Supervisors to bind themselves^to
keep the City Hail clean. Another re
quired auction of trancbises and the third
the prohibition of garbaÂ»e-carts in the
streets in day time, while on the matter of
municipal purity it wasdecided to indorse
the Board of Health.
The committee decided to go trie Buck
leyites one better in playing to the
bicyclists. A plunk not only champions
their baggage tight and declares for tÂ»ood
streets and so on, but it demands the pav
ing of Market street with bitumen, the
lighting of Golden Gate Park and good
highways throughout the Siate.
A charter plank was put in, too, remark
able us it may seem. The plank, however,
turns out to be a recommendation that
voters study the charter and vote on it as
they think best.
The taxation plank was referred to a
sub-coniniittee consisting of Charles Wes
ley Reed, Isidor Jacob*, J. A. Spinetti.
Hugo K. Asher and M. O'Brien, who will
talk it over with Auditor Broderick to-day.
The entire committee will meet at Odd
Fellows' Hall at 7:30 o'clock tnis evening.
The convention may become a lively
and highly entertaining one to-night. It
depends on the "nerve" of the anti-
Kanipyites after the day has given its in
dicsitiuns.
Samuel Braunhart was to have been
nominated for benator in the Seventeenth
District at Irish-American Hail, but there
was not a quorum of delegates prespnt,
and the convention adjourned. Braun
hart seems sure of victory, but the Rainey-
Lanigan-Daggett forces are fighting hard
to down him with John Coglihn, and the
Jack of a quorum was attributed to their
efforts.
McKINLEY OR PALMER?
Why Sound-Money Democrats De
clined Honors. "
The Palmer and Buckner campaign,
which has just begun in California, has
furnished at its inception a striking illus
tration of the Democratic landslide to Mc-
Kinley.
The committee in charge of the electoral
ticket has had to change it because some
of the nominees are out-and-out McKinley
men. They decline the honor of places on
the ticket because they believe that the
sound-money cause and the interests of
the people generally will be best served
and the defeat of the anarchistic captors of
their party most surely effected by Mc-
Kinley's election.
One of tnese is William F. Detert of
Am ador County, and in his place TnoÂ«nas
B. Bond of Lakeport has been named.
Another one is William J. Hunsaker of
Los Angeles, ana this vacancy has been
filled by naming L. B. Hakes of San
Diego. Jeremiah Lynch has taken the
place of John Herman of San Francisco
and Robert Y. Hayne is named instead of
J. J. Valentine, who is out of the State.
The ticket of electors now stands as fol
lows:
Clay W. Taylor, Shasta.
Thomas B. Bond, Lake.
James K. O'Brien, Yuba.
John Rosenfeld, San Francisco.
Jeremiah Lynch, San Francisco.
Charles Anderson, Santa Barbara.
John Roth, Tulare. - , , Â£
Robert Y. Hayne, San Francisco.
L. B. Hakes, San Diego.
'The Palmer and Buckner ticket is not
intended for Democrats who are willing
to vote lor McKinley, but for the many
Democrats whose party prejudices are so
deepseated that they will not vote the Re
publican ticket and who would gladly
support a ticket representing true Demo
cratic principles.
"Day after day," said Secretary Elliott
McAllister yesterday, "we receive in in
creasing .numbers expressions of gratifi
cation at our putting the ticket in tne field
from Democrats who would otherwise vote
for Bryan." *
Ten paid canvassers were out in this City
and Oakland yesterday soliciting signa
tures to the big petition necessary to file
with the Secretary of State. Members of
the committee also carry blank petition?,
and many have been sent to interior
workers.
The literary committee is busy, and next
week a bie and varied supply of campaign
literature will be ready for distribution.
The leaders have decided to carry on a
vigorous campaign and able sound- money
Democrats will soon appear on the hust
ings. '?'>o".;><

BUCKLEY RATIFICATION.
A Bigr One Will Be Held Some Day
Next: Week.
The executive committee of the Buck
leyites considered the big ratification
meeting of the party last night. It had
been set for last Wednesday night and
then postponed to allow the Silverites to
use Metropolitan Hall for their mass-meet
ing of that evening.
The date was not fixed last night, as it
was not known what evenings next week
Metropolitan Hall could be secured.
Joseph I. Dimond, the candidate for
Mayor, will be the principal speaker of
the eveninz and all candidates will spe;ik
briefly, pledging support to the platform.
A quartet will help vary the proceedings
and a band and bonfires will help whoop
things up. It was decided last night to
require of every candidate a written
pledge to live up to the promises of the
platform if elected.
Secretary D. M. Gavigan served on
Registrar Hinton yesterday the alternate
writ of mandate granted oy the Supreme
Court. Mr. Hinton expressed a desire to
see the leeal que*tion speedily determined.
Garret McEnerney, attorney for the Elec
tion Commissioners, will probably conduct
the case in opposition to the Buckleyites.

PHCENIX CLUB.
The Drill Corps Paraded In Their I
Gay Uniforms.
Andrew Branch addressed the Phoenix
Club in Scottish Hall last night on the is
sues of the day and made a convincing ar
gument on the vital necessity for protec

uniforms tnrned out for drill, and were
applauded for the neat manner in which
they executed the marching evolutions.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 18, 1896.
REPUBLICANS OF
THE WEST END.
Magnificent Popular De
monstration at the
Chutes.
ELOQUENCE AND SONG.
Masterly Address on Protection
by Ex-Governor George
C. Perkins.
GEORGE A. KNIGHT SPEAKS.
The Democratic Party Is Hauled Over
the Coals by the Hon. Eugene
F. Loud.
Persuasive and impassioned eloquence,
music whose sound stirred all the sensi
bilities of patriotic bouls, the leaping,
dancing flames of great big bonfires and
the starry raaiance of countless incandes
cent lights â all combined to render last
night's Republican rally at the Chutes a
truly grand affair.
The occasion was the first public de
monstration of the West End Republican
Ciub and its members certainly did them
selves proud. About 5000 persons were
present, the proportion of ladies being
very large, and the big Casino was barely
large enough to hold half of the great
assemblage.
The interior of the building was elab
orately decorated, flags, festoons and
shields adorning the walls ana roof,
while the cornices were outlined by row
after row of electric lights in various
colors.
On the staee sat the Hon. George C. i
Perkins, the Hon. Eugene F. Loud, the '
Hon. George A. Knight and a number of
other prominent visitors, besides the fol
lowing committees of the club:
Executive <ommittee â C. O. Burton
(chairman), M. M. Stern (vice-chairman),
Hon. J. H. Aitken, Alva Watt. E. O.
Tuttle and Lyman Mowry. Finance com
mittee â General E. S. Salomon, Dr. C. D.
â¢Salfield, D. S. Crittenden and C. E. Me-
Gowan. Reception committee â C. O.
Burton, M. M. Stern and Hon. J. H. Ait
ken.
Mr. Stern, who is the Western Addition's
choice lor Supervisor from the Twelsih
Ward, and Ben 1. Salomon deserve much
of the crt-dit tor the admirable order and
smoothness which characterized the entire
affair.
Mr. Salonv n in a graceful address of
welcome called the vast as-embly to order.
He said he had always believed that Re
publicanism was strong in the Western
Audiiion, but now the veriest skeptic
would have to acknowledge the fact. He
said he would leave speech-making to tne
club's distinguished guests, but before in
troducing them would assure the audience
that they would hear the cream of Repub
lican logic and eloquence.
Mr. Perkins was introduced amid much
applause. He paid a compliment to the
committee on arrangements for the bril
liancy and ta^te displayed in the d cora
tions and the general harmony apparent
among the Republicans of the Western
Addition.
"We have lately heard good news from
the Green Mountains of the East," he
said. "The old State of Vermont promises
a Republican majority of 40.000, while
Maine jroe9 her 10,000 bettar. The people
oi the Union ana the people of California
are coming to the conclusion that the
Democratic regime is a well-proved
laiiure."
Mr. Perkins then gave a spirited and
Jucid exposition of some of tie principal
planks in the Republican party platlor'm,
notably the protective tariff doctrine. The
Gorman-Wilson tariff bill, for which he
said the Democratic party was responsible,
might be styled a bill for financial ruin
ana deficiency rather than for revenue to
the Government. He outlined the history
of the bill and its disastrous results upon
the National finances.
"tVe have the grandest country in the
world," concluded t&e Senator, "'"and all
we need is a wise administration. This
need can be repaired by means of the bal
iot-box. Free and unlimited coinage of
silver will not help matters. We would
only be injured by such a policy, and the
first to ieel the smart would be the la
borer, the mechanic, tne bone and sinew of I
the Nation."
Tne address closed with a glowing trib- |
ute of loyalty and regard to Major Me- I
Kinley, which called forth volleys of rap
turous appluuse.
The bn:id played "Hail Columbia" and
the California Quartette sang a stirring
campaign song, the refrain to which,
"That's Wi:at'Â« the Matter," was so cor
diaily applaud d that th- tuneful song
fters gav<? "Up Salt River."
Hon. Eugene Loud was the next speaker.
The Republican party, he said, was ready
and willing to meet and refute any false
issue which might be created lor the politi
cal telogL'ing of the people.
"The Democratic party," he continued,
"had better stop and look about a iittie.
It is hastening toward the hat-money
goal. It is trying to catch the vote of the
American people by promising them an
unlimited and illimitable Natiolal del
uge of silver. What this country
wants above all things is a return to the
system of protection to American indus
try which made us a great Nation. We
want a res oration of popular confidence
in the Government. This can be brought
about by the election of the Republican
Presidential nominee.
"McKinley is a man of whom the Na
tion may well be proud. [Tremendous
applause.] This man was nominated not
by rings, bosses or political plotters; he
was catted ior and i > is nomination de
manded by the voice of the Nation. This
is the man who will lea<l to victory the
I same grand party which saved the Union
in 1861." v
The quartet sang "McKinley's the
MÂ»n" in fine style, giving as an encore
"Whom Shall He Be?"
Mr. Knight was received with an out
burst of applause. He had barely com
menced speaking when the lights went
out.
"Never mind the darkness," he criod
amid a general laugh; 'McKinley will
bring us out into the light."
"'lhe blacksmith, thu farmer and the
clerk," he continued, "should receive suf
ficient pay for their work in order to live
and raise thmr children in a manner
worthy of the dignity of American citi
zenship. The wage rates ol Europe or the
Orient cannot be allowed to Dreva.l here.
"Now, how can we keep up the honora
ble estate of American labor? Protection,
I assure you, is the only means. In the
early part of this century we were pro
| tecied by the ocean; but now the vast
expanse of water has been practi
cally get at naught by the 'ocean
greyhounds,' and we must look to National
right'and law for the protection, without
which our country will infallibly sink to
the industrial level of the Old World.
"When you get home," he concluded,
"I asK yon to think over the Democratic
party, its platform, its nominees and its
ways. You will find them unworthy the
serious consideration of intelligent Amer
ican cit zens."
Mr. Knight pave a sparkling satirical
description of the Wilson bill, which he
said was "sired toy John Bull and dammed
by America." [Laughter.]
- "We want confidence in each other, and
then money will not be lacking. If I had
Claus Spreckel9' note for $500 I would uoi
be afraid of coming to want in any city of
the world. We want our Government's
monetary medium to be as worthy of gen
eral confidence and faith a3 is an honest,
solvent man's note of hand."
The assemblage dispersed with three
cheers for the Republican nominees, after
which the gnests spent an hour or two
amid the attractions on the grounds.

tection and Honor.

SAMUEL M. SHORTRIDGE.
Just Convalescing: From a Very
Serious Illness.
Samuel M. Shortridge has been confined
to his room in the Palace Hotel for the
past ten days with a serious attack of sick
ness. He was able to leSvfr his bed yester
day for the first time and his physician is
confident that he will be able to go out
some time next week.
On account of his sickness Mr. Short
ridge has been obliued to cancel his many
engagements during, the past ten days to
speak In San Francisco, San Jose, Stock
ton and elsewhere.
German -American s.
The regular meeting of the German-
American Club will take place to-night at
413 Bush street. The programme which
has been arranged by the executive com
mittee will undoubtedly prove to be an
interesting one. A delegation from the
Teutonia Singing Society will be present
and will render several vocal selections.
The enrolling committee reports great
success in obtaining new members for the
club. All German-Americans who have
not yet signed the rolls will have the op
portunity to do so at to-night's meetiflt?,
and it is expected that a great many wil:
take advantage of the invitation to do so.
A large number of the German- Ame icans
in the club have hitherto been Democrats,
but they have concluded to vote for pro
tection, prosperity and patriotism and are
among the most ardent workers in the
Republican cause.
The executive committee will soon make
arrangements for a monster mass-meeting
of German-American Republicans, which
will undoubtedly be held at the Audito
rium.
Stratton Indorsed.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 17.â Uni
versity Students' Republican Club met
this afternoon and unanimously indorsed
Fred S. Btratton for Senator. "They also
indorsed Oliver, Easton and Waste for
dele, to the county convention, which
will be voted on at the primaries next
Saturday.
G. F. Remhardt '97 and Ralph Marshall
'97 were candidates on the anti-Stratton
ticket, but such strong pressure was
brought to bear against anything that op
posed Stratton that they withdrew from
the ticket.
A dele ation of probably 100 representa
tives from the Young Men's Republican
Club of Berkeley and the Students' Re
publican Club of the university will at
tend the rally to be held at the Audito
rium building in San Francisco to-morrow
evening.
* â

CROSS COMES TO
TEACH FOOTBALL
Stanford's New Coach Ar
rives Earlier Than
Expected.
WAS YALE'S CENTER.
Believes in Sparing the Men
From Too Hard Work at
First
HE WAS TAKEN FOR COBB3TT
Is Eager to See His Pupils and
Wants to Do Some Hunting
and Cycling.
Cross, the youn? giant of Yale, who is
to coach the Stanford football team, ar
rived here last night direct from New
York. It is not an exaggeration to call
him a giant, for he is six feet three inches
in height and weighs 222 pounds.
Harry P. Cross hails from Wakpfield,
R. 1., and was center rush on the Yale
team last year. Just before |graduation
this summer hÂ» was voted t c second
best all-round athlete at Yale, Sheldon
having the first place.
During the football seasons of 1893 and
1894 he was center rush on the Yale sec
ond eleven against the great Stillman, the
phenomenal Varsity center up to 1895,
when he was graduated. For his whole
four years at Yale Cross was on the track
team as a hammer-thrower.
Dave Brown, the Stanford football
manager and coast champion mile runner,
had gone up the road to meet him and was
the only escort, for the exact date of the
coach's arrival was hot known to the men
at P lo Alto.
"I'm eager to get down as soon as pos
sible to see thosu fellows." was about the
first thing the new coach had to and
the next was: "Say, but this is tine air:
ought to be able to do great work out here.
I can't say just what I shall
do with the men until I see them,"
he continued, "but the main thing about
the training will be not too much work.
We must save our good men, and not do
them up early in the season. At first I
shall give them very light work, but no
gymnasium-work. All the exercise will
be out on : he field.
"1 want the men in condition before we
do much lining up.
"As to diet, the men should abstain to a
certain extent witliouta training-table un
til, perhaps, several weeks before the
game. The man that won't look out for
his own good without being watched has
no business training for football.
"Five positions to fill on the team?
Well, we must get out some good, lively,
heavy men for backs. I'll have those can
didates for fullback out kicking to-mor
row.
"From what I hear of the weight and
experience of the Stanford line I think
heavy line play will be the feature of our
game, particularly as the Berkeley line
will be made up pretty much of new men.
"On the way out I was taken for Corbett
and for Chovnski."
SOUND MONEY.
The League Decides to Keep It All
in Its Own Pocfcets.
The executive committee of the Sound
money League held a meeting yesterday
afternoon and dicussed the maierof the
disposition of the money collected thus
far. A motion was made to turn over the
money to the Republican State Central
Committee, but objection was made on
the ground that tne State Central Com
mittee might use the funds in advancing
the prospects of a candidate for the
United States Senatorship rather than in
the sound-money propaganda.
It was decided to keep the fund where
it was.
A Small B!uze.
Box 453 at 10 :25 p. m. was for a fire in a two
story dwelling at 4083 Army street, owned by
John Orr and occupied by E. Philpot. Loss
fSO. It was caused by carelessness with
matches.
