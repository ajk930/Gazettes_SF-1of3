The New York delegation will not bolt the convention. It cannot afford to
do so as such action would split the party in New York State and the Tammany
machine would lose its local power. Hill will present a minority report from
the Committee on Platform. He and Whitney have already drafted it. â  It
upholds the cold standard and indorses the administration. ,
Hill is expected to address the convention to-day. The gold men are much
better organized than the silverites, in whose ranks personal ambitions and sec
tional jealousies are cropping out. Stevenson's candidacy is being urged for
ward.
Governor Stone said to me to-night . that Bland would be nominated on the
fourth ballot. Delegates and visitors despite the : excitement and fatigue of the
second day of the .convention are still swarming about the hotel corridors at
this hour. It is not thought possible that candidates for the Presidential nomi
nation will be balloted for to-day.

CHICAGO, 111., July B.â After passing
â hrouirlj a !iÂ«UesÂ« morning session the
Democratic National Convention wit
ies9ed two scenes to-night which com
jensated those whose pent-up feelings
Â»ad been given no vent in the eariier part
if the day. Men anrl women joined in the
lemonstration for each of the contending
actions of the Democracy. They shouted

â¢urned the convention hall into a pande

It was during the rollcall of States on a
notion to adopt the minority report of

gymnastics which their enthusiasm forced
on them. A man among the spectators
rose and waved his hat and in an instant
the audience was up, seemingly en masse,
and people were cheering like madmen.
Things began to quiet down after a few
minutes, but the playing of the band
broke in as though it were intended as a
signal to renew the applause. Up again
came the Eastern delegates and up came
the spectators. In the midst of the New-
York seats a bearded man jumped on a
chair and waved his hat. He shouted
something to his fellow-delepates and
nearly every man among the New Yorkers
leaped to his feet, many standing on their
chairs and shouting like men gone wild in
delirious joy.

Chicago, ill., July 8.)
A superficial view of the fielÂ«i this morn
ing seemed to prove t' at this convention
was sobered by the effect of its work in
the temporary organization. It had
trampled on a party precedent followed
for fifty-four years. The California dele
gation, ridden by its leaders, had helped
brain the National Committee by voting
for Daniel, and the young members were
s jrprised when they were told that in 1888
Senator White was made temporary chair
man at St. Louis in the same way against
which they voted with ungrateful solidity
to-day.
Under the temporary organization the
majority proceeded without compunction.
Loot and pillage were virtues to ther
After Daniel had laid down in his spec a
the programme of discredit and dishonor,
the plan more disastrous to every public
and private interest than would have been
the successful division of the Union
which he and his section attempted in
1861, the convention obeyed its riders to
the end. When it adjourned the word
went around that the two-thirds rule was
to be respected, and the sound-money
men rejoiced that responsibility had
sobered the power-intoxicated majority.
That this was a delusion was apparent
when the credentials committee proposed
to expel bodily the Michigan, Nebraska
and South Dakota delegations, all elected
as regularly and commissioned by as in
vulnerable party authority as that of Cali
fornia. It then dawned upon the radicals
who needed the old rule to guard them
against the fury of their own side that to
day the men who yesterday cut an equally,
venerable, just and powerful party prac
tice to elect Daniel, would be found invok
ing the memory of their fathers, the an
cient practice and hallowed precedent of
the party, to sustain the two-thirds rule
because, if abrogated, Bland would be nom
inated on the first ballot. Some of them
say they will prevent this, because Bland
is in alliance with Altgeld and has prom
ised to make an anarchist Attorner-Geu
eral. Already the match of disorder, which
yesterday they scratched so gayly, has
kimlie'd to conflagration against every
safeguard of property and that fright
ens them. Robespierre lost his head
by the ?ame knife on which the blood
of Louis XVI had mated but eighteen
months.
There is a growing suspicion that the
syndicate of Senators .is under contract to
deliver the nomination to Teller, in ac
cordance with a promise and programme
arranged before his bolt at St. Louis.
Look at it I Senator Daniel, temporary;
Senator White, permanent chairman;
Senator Jones, chairman of resolutions
committee. This closes the Senatorial
grip on every instrument of the conven
tion's power.
The maker! of the constitution, giving
the Senate concurrence with the President
In treaties and confirmation of appoint
ments, secured against puppetting the
Presidency by providing that when elec
tion by the people fuiled, the chair shall
be tilled by a unit vote of States in the
House. These Senators, sitting with Re- I
publicans in that chamber for years, have
seen them make an errand boy of the
President. They have seen Johnson im
peached for revolting and Garfield mur
dered for refusing to wear the badge of a
district messenger boy. The practice
made each Senator a President within his
jurisdiction.
The crime called Senatorial courtesy,
applied to confirmations, grew out of this
custom. From the first Mr. Cleveland
stood and at the end stands against the
usurpation of his office. Therefore, these
Senators ure syndicated to make their
creature President; to make in the con
vention a collusion forbidden by the con
stitution. It means a radical change in
our scheme of government, accomplished
by indirection, which will make the Sen
ate the executive authority and the Presi
dent a nullity. , It cuts every check and
destroys every balance of the constitution;
substitutes for the single Presidency a
panarchy, and provides means for final
absorption of the House itself and an end
of popular government, under a written
constitution.
The next few hours will tell whether
this conspiracy succeeds now or is de
ferred by invocation of the same forces of
confusion in which it generated.
Last night the old Democracy met in
council under the chairmanship of Sena
tor Gray. The room was crowded and the
crowd indignant. Every Southern State j
was represented, some by tne sound mi- I
norities of their delegations, others by
Democrals delegated by business centers.
Their attitude was one of the most aston
ishing features of this astonishing time.
They came asking the sound Democrats
of the North to save them from Southern
politicians, as the same Democracy saved i
them from Republican politicians of the !
North. Earnest men were they, declaring
that the majority programme will destroy
the South by destruction of credit. They
SDoke of the growth of dishonor from the
repudiation seed planted by Mississippi
sixty years ago, and declared that their
own demagogue politicians are more their
energies than the Northern armies which
lelt a trail of ashes behind them in
the civil war. They refused to submit
to tbis thing, and declared that
separate action is absolutely neces
sary to save their people and preserve
their credit and honor. Some of these
gentlemen have been, some are in Con
gress. Many are in business. All are
patriots. They belong to the later school
of Southern men and declare that Ala
bama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West
Virginia, and perhaps old Virginia, will
aot give an electoral vote to this ticket
which stands for repudiation and dis
honor. They join their fortunes to every
Northern State in the council, led by
Bragg, Ewing, MacVeagh, Coudert, Gover
nor Russell. Martin of Nebraska, aye, and
men from Montana, Idaho, California,
Oregon and all the North.
While the infuriates in the convention
denounce goldbugs people wonder at the
source of all this maddened display and
the lavish expenditures which stage the
tragedy. A weazened little man, on
whose skeleton finger glitters a diamond
known as the Montana kobinoor, is seen
furtively gliding around hotels and seek
ing locked rooms. He looks like an
emptied purse. It is Clark of Montana,
the thirty-ply millionaire silver miner.
He and twenty other silver millionaires
are here merely in behalf of the toiling
masses, ready to poultice their wounds
with silver at $1 29 per ounce which
costs 12 cents to produce. But then the
profit on drugs was always high, especi
ally when the physician gets a commis
sion on the prescription.
The three States marked for expulsion
were assassinated one at a time. The
knife was used first on Nebraska. Life
long Democrats were sent out to the
morgue and men who were never in the
party before sat in their places in a con
vention presided over temporarily and
permanently by Senators who voted for
â  the Pefter-Allen bill to repeal the resurnp
j tion act and yusDend specie payment.
The morning session was not piquant.
When the Nebraska delegation was ex
' pelled and the one seated by no right but
micht marched in an attempt was made
to get up a demonstration. The un
ele'cted usurpers were led by Bryan, clad
in a silver mantle and following a silver
| banner, which he regarded with that
rapt look which a Mohammedan bestows
upon his prayer rug. It was a failure-
Nobody noticed it, and the gentlemen ex
pelled to make room for this tawdry play
got the most attention.
It is settled th*t California, per Mr.
Foote, is to second Senator Blackburn's
nomination for the Presidency. Whether
the delegation can be forced into support
ing him is a much-discussed matter.
The convention's assassination of Michi
gan was iollowed by a war dance while
the band pluyed "Dixie." It has rapidly
crystallized opinion and made more cer
tain a movement repudiating the repu
diators. John P. leish.

Delegates were glow in arriving at the
Coliseum this morning. While waiting
for the report of the Committee on Cre
dentials the convention wag addressed
by several silver men, who hurled defi
ance at the advocates of gold.
The gold delegates from Nebraska and
Michigan were unseated and the free
coinage contestants seated, giving silver
more than the iwo-thirds majority re
quired by the rules for the nomination
of a President.
Senator "White of California was made
permanent chairman of the convention.
The afternoon session, beginning at 5
o'clock, wag mostly occupied -with the
debates on the adoption of the minority
report of the Committee on Credentials
in the Michigan contested case.
Senator White made a very favorable
impression. He has a clear, strong, pen
etrating voice and hag parliamentary
tactics at his finger-ends. He was en
thusiastically cheered when he said that
his rulings as chairman would be unbi
ased and impartial.
Koss Altgeld's programme has been
faithfully followed thus far. To-mor
row morning the Committee on Plat
form will report. It will declare for
the free coinage of silver at the ratio of
16 to 1. There will be a few planks, but
they will be merely subsidiary.

Chicago, 111., July 8.)
Chicago offered one of her loveliest
mornings to the Democratic Convention
to-day. The refreshing breeze from the
lake had an invigorating effect upon the
large number of delegates who had not
gone to bed until 3 or 4 o'clock this morn
ing and they were in rather a merry mood
when they entered the convention hall.
The delegates wer- late in arriving and
it was nearly 11 o'clock before the con
vention was called to order. After tho
chaplain of the occasion had asked a
blessing upon the gold and silver men
alike, as the rains and the dews and the
sunshine fall upon the just and unjust,
the band struck up "Away Down South
in Dixie." This enlivened matters, the
delegates from the South throwing their
hats into the air and applauding. "The
Girl I Left Behind Me" was then produced
by the band, whereupon New York and
the Atlantic Coast were heard from, there
being a few gentlemen of Irish descent in
the convention whahad Jeft several "gals"
apiece behind them in New York and
Boston. It was a morning of music
While the convention was waiting for the
report of the Committee on Credentials a
Boies band outside struck up "Auld Lang
Syne" and several Democratic Caledonian
yells went up on the inside. Then a
Bland band marched in playing as a testi
monial of devotion to the Sunny South
"My Maryland," and the Democratic yell
broke loose again.
The silver men were in jolly good humor
and enjoyed the music greatly, while
Senator Hill and a few gold friends wera
away somewhere in seclusion humming
the "Dead March in Saul," relieved with
a few snatches of the popular air, "Do, Do,
My Huckleberry, Do," and that college
song, ' : Adoo, Adoo, Kind Friends, Adoo,"
the Senator and his friends fully appreci
ating the fact that they had been done to
a turn by Boss Altgelu and his push. The
gold men in the convention were not in a
very pleasant mood and they kept calling
for "Hill, Hill," while Chairman White
persistently rapped for order. Then the
chairman would call upon some gentle
man for a speech to while away the time,
and as he called npon none but silver men

a wild, glad shout went up from tbe rep
resentatives of the irrepressible West.
Governorr Hogg of Texas made what
would no doubt have been a very fine
speech if anybody had beard what he sa ; d,
but his ttestnres were very dramatic, and
when he scowled like a thunderstorm in
St. Louis, and murderously shook his
clinched fist at a few hundred visitors in
the chairs at the farther end of tbe hall,
the people yelled and applauded him.
This inspired the Governor to greater ex
ertions and he stamped his- broad Texan
feet and brandished his clinched fist in
heavy villain style, the poor man laboring
under the delusion that The Call staff
could hear every word that he said and
were taking down his remarks in six dif
ferent styles of shorthand.
When Hogg got through Chairman
White rapped for order, and the gold men
began yelling for Hill again as noisily and
as piteously as a flock of lambs that had
lost their mothers. Blackburn of Ken
tucky received a great round of cheers
when he stepped up to the platform and
hurled the resonant defiance of the silver
men into the gold teeth of the opposition.
"Hill! Hill!" yelled the gold men once
more, and their request was met by the
production of Boss Altgeld, who expressed
his very peculiar views on tbe subject of
political economy, advancing the start
ling proposition that if you wished to ex
chanpe a bushel of corn for a half pint of
whisky you can't do it without taking in
silver as the middleman, and that if you
can't get the half ounce of silve r the bushel
of corn and tbe half pint of whisky will
immediately be put upon the market for a
quarter of an ounce of silver, and that the
poor man, who in thatevent buys as much
for a quarter of an ounce as he had pre
viously paid a half an ounce for, is de
frauded and robbed by Mr. Hill's gold
bugs.
Altgeld was well applauded, although
only a very few could hear what he said,
but they clapped thsir hands and shouted
at him to make him feel good and as a
mart of courtesy to the boss. Then the
song of Hill was again taken up by the
belated New Yorker?, and Chairman
White, having succeeded in obtaining a
hearing, remarked sarcastically in that
clear, ringiDg silver free-coinage voice of
his that the chair would take great pleas
ure in recognizing the distinguished gen
tleman from New York, "but," he added,
"what's the use of calling for a gentleman
who is not in the hall?"
"Give it np," shouted a delegate from
"Montana. After this diversion Mr. Ober
â meyer of Pennsylvania was turned loose
on the platform and harrowed up the feel
ings of the outraged gold men and rubbed
salt on their wounds by exclaiming dra
matically, "Yesterday the seat of empire
was transferred from the Atlantic States
to the Mississippi Valley."
Yon should have heard the yell with
which this roar of defiance was greeted.
And so on Until nearly 2 o'clock" there
â¢were silver speeches and gold groans, and
then the convention growing very weary
of so much oratory and tired of waiting
for the credentials committee, took a re
cess until 5 p. m.
The gold men left the hall feeling that
the silver men were on horseback and in
tended to ride roughshod over them.
Several hundred newspaper correspon
dents are very much dissatisfied with the
manner in which seats for the press have
bÂ«en arranged. It is right, of course, tbat
the press associations should be given tbe
nearest space to the speakers' platform on
both sides, but the hundreds of corre
spondents who have been herded and
cramped in a corral 100 feet away where
they can see but little and hear nothing
are chafing in their chairs and muttering
their condemnation of tl.e mismanage
ment by reason of which they have been
obliged to suffer. Immediately back of
the speakers' platform and on both sides
of it, where an excellent view of all the
delegations may be obtained, and where
all the speakers may be plainly heard, is a
large space sufficient to accommodate al
most twice the number of poor devils in
ihe corral, >et this space is given up to
ladies and gentlemen who have a push.
In consequence, the correspondents are
writing to their respective papers roast
lets concerning the sergeant-at-arms and
tbe manner in which be has laid out the
ground plan of the convention. There
were 600 seats for the press at the St.
Louis Convention, while in tbis big hall
which will easily seat 15,000 people, there
are not more then 400. However, The
Call staff have been treated well, because
they have succeeded in obtaining four
seats, while the Examiner and the Chron
icle were allowed but two each, a visible
indication of tbe respective circulation and
influence of tbe Chronicle and Examiner
as compared with the circulation and in
fluence of The Call.
Two new free shows of the dime museum
order have been opened on State street,
wituin a block of the Palmer House, at a
very expensive rental. The names of
these are blazoned in incandescent lights
over their respective entrances â the New
York Journal and the Cincinnati En
quirer. The vacant store occupied by the
Journal is used for the purpose of an exhi
bition-room of quaint-colored posters ad
vertising the Sunday Journal, and a large
room partitioned off in tbe rear contains
the real features of the museum â the
writers for that paper, of whom there are
probable a score. After tbe horribly ugly
women who throng the sidewalks on State
street every day have examined tbe
posters they stand at tbe door of tbe inner
room and gaze with ill-concealed admira
tion at the classic features and the Van
dyke beard of Ned Hamilton of San Fran
cisco, who sometimes does his writing
there. Notning obstructs the view of
passers-by from the staff of the Cincinnati
Enquirer. The writers extend from the
show-window to the rear of the room,
illuminated witn electric lights and ex
posed to the raking fire of wistful female
eyes, whose shafts pierce through the
plate-gla?s windows and tempt the good,
pious, gentle, modest reporters to blush.
This placing newspaper writers on pub
lic exhibition is suegeative of a freak de
partment in a dime museum. It is done
fur the purpose of advertising the news
papers which resort to thU store-renting
habit. I think that the columns of the
newspaper itself, the quantity and quality
of matter which it contains, its reputation
for reliability and integrity, are the best,
ihe most rational and succe?sful advertise
ment that a newspaper could have, if this
plan of giving away a bicycle to the pur
chaser of each box of matches is persisted
in some of tbe sensational journals will
will soon be offering a reporter free to each
subscriber.
A Democratic bootblack, while spoiling
my tan shoes a morning or two ago, was
bewailing the stupidity and the ignorance
of ttie working people of Chicago. "Why,"
he said, "I know a lot of Democratic work
ingmen in this town who say that they
are going to vote for McEinley because
they want to have the McKinley bill in
again, and because they have had nothing
but hard times since Cleveland and the
rest of the Democrats got into power." I
gave this weeping Democrat a copper cent
for a tip.
Senator Hill made his fir^t appearance
ia the convention to-day, at the opening
of the evening session at 5 o'clock. He
must hare felt nattered at the applause
bestowed upon him. After having thrown
a man into the soup it is majrnanimity
and good politics to stroke him on the
back and compliment him on being a fine
swimmer. John Pacl Cosgrave.

DESCRIBED BY McCUIRE.
Tumult Caused by the Outpouring
of the Feelinsrs of Silver and
Cold Men.
CHICAGO, 111., July B.â The first de
monstrations of the Democratic National
Convention of 1896 occurred in the Coli
seum to-night. Thi-y were the outpour
ings of the pent up feelings of the silver
and gold wings of the party. The scenes
were full of color. They were heroic in
character.
It was all over the contest in the Michi
pan delegation. There were majority and
minority reports from the committee on
credentials, and the champions of tbe two
factions urged the indorsement of their re
spective recommendations in outbursts of
fevered oratory.
The majority report recommended the
seating of the contestants from Michigan,
and the minority report declared in favor
of the persons already seated. After hours
of bitter denunciation from both sides a
rollcall was ordered, and when New York
was reached a great cheer went up from
the vast throng*
THE SA]N FKANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JDLY 9, 1896.
It was started from tbe delegates from
the Eastern States, and tbe refrain was
taken np by tbe galleries and carried to
the roof. It was indeed a period of intense
excitement. It was the first pronounced
expression of sentiment on the part of the
advocates of the yellow metal and their
friends.
For a short time it looked like a stam
pede of tbe conventipn by this compact
and thoroughly organized element. Flags
were wared, bats were tossed np, women
stood on chairs and cheered, side by side
with the men, all seemed carried away by
this sudden expression of devotion to
Tammany and the old Democracy of what
was once affectionately alluded to by the
American people as the Empire State of
tbe Union.
When the time came for the silver men
to cheer it was thought by some that the
empire had moved westward. The dem
onstration of the silverites was proroked
when the chair announced the result of
the ballot, and it was shown that they had
a large majority in the convention reject
ing tbe amendment and sustaining the
original report of the majority of the com
mittee on resolutions to seat the contest
ing delegates from Michigan. These dele
gates are united for silver, and as they are
in the majority they will carry Michigan,
which is pledged to the nnit rule, twenty
eight strong, into the camp of the white
metallists.
The specta cle was magnificent. A long,
united chorus of voices seemed to swell up
from the very ground, it was carried
through the rows of silver delegates and
thence to tbe galleries, gain ing additional
force as it careered along to the upper sec
tions of the Colisseum and spent its fury
in the open air beyond. The music of the
band was lost in the volume of voice that
rose np from a solid, aggressive, excited,
angry, silver multitude. The sea of fuces
was a vast mirror that cast forth a thous
and varied reflections under the rays of
tha electric lights. The scene dazzled, ex
cited the Benses, bewildered the compre
hension.
The vote showed that the silver men
had a handsome majority in the conven
tion. They polled 558 votes against 388
by the enemy. The result was most cheer
ing to the silver men and they are confi
dent that they will be able to control the
convention, even if the two-thirds rule is
allowed to stand. As to candidates they
were not heard of in the advance skirmish
of the gold and silver men to-day. It is
not likely that a vote on candidates will
be reached to-morrow.
The day will be consumed with the plat
form, and Senator Hill of New York will
probably be heard in a speech in support
of the minority report which will be sub
mitted to the convention. "It will be the
speech of his life," said a Tammany man
to me to-night, referring to Hill's attitude
on the financial question and the line of
thought he would probably pursue in his
efforts to convince the silver delegates of
the error of their ways. "Tbe minority
report," continued my informant, "will
commend the honesty, courage and fidelity
of the present Democratic administration.
From the silver men, however, I learn
that President Cleveland will be ignored.
Bland is not gaining any additional
strength. In fact, he lost grevsnd to-day.
Illinois gave it out that the delegation
would only vote for him on the first
ballot. This was a severe blow to the
Bland managers, since they do not expect
to secure the nomination of their candi
date until the third or fourth ballot. A.
8. Trude, a leader In the Illinois delega

Illinois will take up a man from within its

Platform of tfje
Democratic Party as Presented
to tfye Convention.
We, the Democrats of the United States, in National Convention assembled, do
reaffirm our allegiance to those great essential principles of justice and liberty upon
which our institutions are founded and which the Democratic party has advocated
from Jefferson's time to our ownâ freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom
of conscience, the preservation of personal rights, the equality of all citizens before
the law and the faithful observance of constitutional limitations.
During all these years the Democratic party has resisted the tendency of selfish
interests to the centralization of governmental power and steadfastly maintained the
integrity of the dual scheme of gover nment established by the founders of tbis Re
public of republics. Under its guidance and teachings the great principle of local
self-government has found its best expression in the maintenance of the rights of the
States and in its assertion of the necessity of confining the General Government to
the exercise of the powers granted by the constitution of the United State?.
Realizing that the money question is paramount to all others at this time, we in
vite attention to the fact that the Federal constitution names silver and gold together
as the money metals of the United States, and that tbe first coinage law passed by
Congress under the constitution made the silver dollar ihe monetary unit,
and admitted gold to free coinage at a ratio based upon the silver dollar unit. We de
clare that the act of 1873 demonetizing silver without the knowledge or approval of the
Ameritan people has resulted in the appreciation of gold and a corresponding fall in
the prices of commodities produced by the people; a heavy increase in the burden of
taxation and of all debts, public and private, the entrenchment of the money-lending
class at home and abroad, the prostration of industry and impoverishment of the peo
ple. We are unalterably opposed to monometallism, which has locked fast the pros
perity of the industrial people in the paralysis of hard times. Gold monometallism is
a British policy and its adoption has brought other nations into financial servitude to
London. It is not only un-American but anti-American and it can be fastened on
the i United States only by the stifling of that spirit and love of liberty which pro
claimed our political independence in 1776 and won it In tbe war of the Revolution.
We demand the free and unlimited coinage of both gold and silver at the present
legal ratio of 16 to 1 without waiting for the aid or consent of any otner nation. We
demand that the standard silver dollar shall be a full legal tender equally with gold
for all debts, publio and private, and we favor such legislation as will prevent in the
future the demonetization of any kind of legal tender money by private contract.
We are opposed to the policy and practice of surrendering to the holders of the
obligations of the United States the option reserved by law to the Government of
redeeming such obligations in either silver coin or goM coin.
We aie opposed to the issue of interest-bearing bonds of the United States in time
of peace, and condemn the trafficking with banking syndicates, which, in exchange
for bonds, and at an enormous profit to themselves, supply tbe ifederal treasury with
gold to maintain the policy of gold monometallism.
Congress alone has the power to coin and Issue money, and President Jackson
declared that this power could not be delegated to corporations or individuals. We
therefore demand that the power to issue notes to circulate as money be taken from
the National banks and that all paper money shall be issued directly oy the Treasury
Department, be redeemable in coin and receivable for all debts public and private. We
hold that tariff duties should be levied ior the purpose of revenue, such duties to be so
adjusted as to operate equally throughout the country and not discriminate between
class or section, and that taxation should be limited by the need 3of tbe Government,
honestly and economically administered.
We denounce as disturbing to business the Republican threat to restore the
McEinley law, which has twice been condemned by the people in National elections,
and which, enacted until the false plea of protection to home industry, proved a prolific
breeder of trusts and monopolies, enriched a few at the expense of the many, restricted
trade and deprived the producers of the great American staples of access to their
natural markets. Until the money question is settled we are opposed to any agitation
for further changes in our tariff laws, except such as are necessary to meet the deficit
in revenue caused by the adverse decision of the Supreme Court on the income tax.
But for this decision by the Supreme Court there would be no deficit in the revenue in
the law passed by a Democratic Congress in strict pursuance of the uniform decisions
of tbat court for nearly 100 years, that court havlne in that decision sustained consti
tutional objections to its enactment which had previously been overruled by the ablest
Judges who have ever sat on that bench.
We declare that it is the duty of Congress to use all the constitutional power which
remains after tbat decision, or which may come from its reversal by the court as it
may hereafter be constituted, so that the burdens of taxation must be equally and im
partially laid, to the end tbat wealth may bear its due proportion of the expenses of
the Government. We hold that the most efficient way of protecting American labor
is to prevent the importation of foreign pauper labor to compete with it in the home
market, and tbat the home market to our American farmers and artisans is greatly re
duced by a vicious monetary system wbicb, depresses the prices of their products be
low the cost of production and thus deprives them of the means of purchasing the
products of our home manufacturers.
The absorption of wealth by the few, the consolidation of our leading railroad sys
tems and the formation of trusts and poois require a stricter control by the 1 -deral
Government of those arteries of commerce. We demand the enlargement of the
powers of the Interstate Commission and such restrictions and guarantees in the con
trol of railroads as will protect the people from robbery and oppression.
We denounce the profligate waste of the money wrung from tbe people by oppres
sive taxation and the lavish appropriations of recent Republican Congresses, which
have kept taxes high while the laborer tbat pays them is unemployed, and products
of the people's toil are depressed in price till they no longer repay the cost of produc
tion. We demand a return to that simplicity and economy which befits a democratic
Government and reduction in the number of useless offices, the salaries of which drain
the substance of the people.
We denounce arbitrary interference by Federal authorities in local affairs as a
Violation of the constitution of the United Btatesand a crime against free institutions,
and we especially object to Government by injunction as a new and highly dangerous
form of oppression by which Federal Judges, in contempt of the laws of the States and
rights of citizens, become at once legislators, Judges and executioners, and we approve
the bill passed at tbe last session of the United States Senate and now pending in the
House of Representatives relative to contempts in Federal courts, and providing for
trials by jury in certain cases of contempt.
No discrimination should be indulged by the Government of the United States in
favor of any of its debtors. We approve of the refusal of the Fifty-third Coneress to
pass the Pacific Railroad funding bill and denounce the efforts of the present Republi
can Congress to enact a similar measure.
Recognizing the just claims of deserving Union soldiers, we heartily indorse the
rule of the present Commissioner of Pensions, tbat no names shall be arbitrarily
dropped from the pension rolls, and the fact of enlistment and service should be
deemed conclusive evidence against disease and disability before enlistment.
We favor the admission of the Territories of New Mexico and Arizona into the
Union as States, and we favor the early admission of all the Territories having the
necessary population and resources to entitle them to statehood, and while they remain
Territories we hold that the officials appointed to administer the eovernment of any
Territory, together with the District of Columbia and Alaska, should be bona-fide resi
dents o! the Territory or district in which the duties are to be performed. The Demo
cratic party believes in home rule and that all public landa of the United States should
be appropriated to the establishment of free homes for American citizens.
We recommend that the Territory of Alaska be granted a delegate in Congress,
and that the general land and timber laws of the United States be extended to said'
Territory.
We extend our sympathy to the people of Cuba in their heroic struggle for liberty
and independence.
We are opposed to life tenure in the public service. We favor appointments based
upon merit, fixed terms of office and such an administration of the civil service laws
as will afford equal opportunities to all citizens of ascertained fitness.
We declare H to be the unwritten law of tbis Republic established by custom and
usage of 100 years and sanctioned by the examples of the greatest and wisest of those
who founded and have maintained our Government that no man should be elidible for
a third term of the Presidential office.
The Federal Government should care for and improve the Mississippi River and
other great waterways of the Republic so as to secure for the interior States easy and
cheap transportation to tidewater. When any waterway of the Republic is of suf
ficient importance to demand aid of the Government such aid should be extended
upon a definite plan of continuous work until permanent improvement is secured.
Confiding in the justice of our cause and the necessity of its success at the polls we
submit the foregoing declaration of principles and purposes to the considerate judg
ment of the American people. We invite the support of all citizens who approve them
and who desire to have them made effective through legislation for the relief of the
people and the restoration of the country's prosperity.

HILL'S PAST VIEWS.
It Is Not Very Lonjr Ajro Since He
Championed the Cause of the
White Metal.
CHICAGO, 111., July B.â A letter writ
ten by Senator Hill to the Atlanta Consti
tution on July 13, 1893, on the issue for
the campaign of 1896, was quietly circu
lated about tbe hall this afternoon.
In the letter Senator Hill declared him
self opposed to the repeal of the Sherman
law. and said:
"We Bhould be for free silver coinage
under an international agreement, if it be
possible to procure it â and for which every
exertion should be made â and if not pos
sible then for independent bimetallism.
This is the one great goal for which we
should strive. It cannot be done at once.
Our friends must not be impa
tient. The people must be educated.
The unexpected action of India and
the general sentiment of the moneyed
classes conspire against us at this time. I
do not believe iv the Bland bill or any
other measure which guarantees anything
less than an unrestricted coinage of cold
and silver alike as pledged in the Demo
cratic National platform. Let us prepare,
not for present vi?tory. but for victory
u>.on that issue in 18%. The repeal of the
Sherman law will not give the relief which
is anticipated. It will aid business tem
porarily, but in a year times will be hard
and tbe demand for permanent financial
relief will be irresistible. We should con
tinue to hold out free silver as the goal
which the country must intimately reach.
Tbe triumph of the monometallist will be
but temporary."
A ROAST FOR GROVER.
Senator Tillman Has an Amend
ment to the President's
Indorsement.
CHICAGO, 111., July B,âWhen the
report of the committee on resolutions is
made to the convention a minority report
will be also presented indorsing the
financial policy of the Cleveland adminis
tration. The report will be very short
and relate exclusively to the financial
plank. It declares for tbe existing
standard and indorses the calling together
of an international monetary conference.
To this Senator Tillman of South Caro
lina will offer an amendment and address
the convention upon it. Senator Tillman 's
amendment is in these words:
We deuounce the administration of Presi
dent Cleveland as un-Democraiic and tyranlcal
*nd as a departure from those principles which
are cherished by all liberty-loving Americans.
The veto power has been used to thwart the
will of the people as expressed by their repre
sen tati ves ia Congress. The appointive power
has been used to subsidize the press, to debauch
Congress and to overawe and control citizens
in the free exercise of their political rights as
voters. A plutocratic despotism is thus sought
to be established on the ruins of the Republic.
We repudiate the construction placed on the
financial plank of the last Democratic National
Convention by President Cleveland and Secre
tary Carlisle as contrary to th? plain meaning
of English words, and as being an act of bad
faith deserving the severest censure.
The issue of bonds in time of peace with
which to buy gold to redeem coin obligations
payable in sliver or gold at the option ot the
Government, and the use of the proceeds to de
fray the ordinary expenses of the Government,
are both unlawful and usurpations of author
ity deserving impeachment.
WEAK AND MISLEADING.
Bailey and Bryan to Enter a Protest
Agrainst the Wording of a Clause
In the Plank.
CHICAGO, 111., July B.â During the
evening Representative Bailey of Texas
and Mr. Bryan of Nebraska entered a pro
test against the wording of the last clause
of the money plank which reiers to legal
tender money. The sentence is regarded
by them as weak and misleading, and
they understand that many of the silver
men oppose it on those grounds. It was
this disagreement among the silver men
that caused the adjournment to-night. It
is hopea an agreement can be speedily
reached to-morrow, but the Indications are
tbat tbe committee will be in session for
perhaps several hours.
Benator Tillman, according to the pro
gramme, will open the debate on the
platform and will be followed by Senator
Jones. Senator Hill will submit the mi
nority report and reply to these gentle
men. The debate, according to an under
standing between Hill and Jones* has been
limited to two hours. But it may take a
wider range and set at naught any agree
ment that has been made.

LEBANON, Mo., July B.â Mr. Bland
was in town this morning and went home
to dinner, returning again at 4:25. After
getting his mail he went into the club
rooms where the bulletins were posted and
read the monotonous recital of the proceed
ings at Cnicago. He took supper with his
family at the Farris residence and sent
word to headquarters that be would not
return until to-morrow morning.
The people here are begining to wake up
and if their champion is nominated tbe

Mr. Bland feels quite sure that the silver
ites will win in the convention and is sin

that the victory of his doctrine will be
victory enough for him.

Chicago, 111., July 8.)
Among the leading candidates for Presi
dent Bland is the only one who appears to
be gainine ground. Illinois pledged her
4^ votes to him on Monday. Tennessee
pledged him her 24 votes yesterday and
the Georgia and Virginia delegations de
clared for him to-day.
There are predictions that the gold men
will select one of the other silver candi
dates and nominate him over Bland by
casting their solid vote whenever the op
portunity may offer. Just now their
motto seems to be "anything to beat
Bland," and they are not concerned about
the "hoodoo" which their support would
cast upon the candiiate so nominated. In
deed, while they profess the tenderest so
licitude for the welfare of the party, they
seem to think that its welfare would be
beÂ«t promoted b/ its defeat in the coming
campaign.
The gold men held a conference in Chi
cago last cv ninp; and decided to devote
their energies and mean? to the organiza
tion of gold monometallic Democratic
clubs throughout the Union during the
next four years to teach the people the
beauties of English monometallism. One
of the distinguished leaders of this educa
tional movement is Colonel John P. Irish,
Naval Officer at the port of San Francisco.
It was expected that the convention
would to-day adopt its platform, but the
exciting struggle over the Michigan con
test lasted until nearly 10 p. m., and, after
effecting permanent organization, tne con
vention adjourned for the day. The plat
form will be reported immediately after
the assembling of the convention to-mor
row and will probably be adopted as re
ported.
Tne sub-committee on platform inserted
the rnti-fundinsr bill plank, and as it was
this morning adopted by the full commit
tee it is now a part of the platform to be
reported to the convention to-morrow and
will undoubtedly be adopted by that body.
This we regard as a great victory and feel
well rewarded for all the effort that it has
coat.
Senator White, having been selected for
permanent chairman, requested that I be
selected to take his place on the commit
tee on platform, which the delegation
promptly did.
We expected a stubborn fight against
that part of the platform, as Mr. Weatlock
of Michigan, who was one of the strongest
supporters of the Reilly bill in the Fifty
third Congress, is the administration rep
resentative from the State of Michigan in
the committee. The plank approving the
action of the Fifty-third Congress wÂ«*s a
direct condemnation of his course in sup
portine the bill.
At first he seemed determined to oppose
the adoption of the plank, but finally
came to me and asked if I was going to
insist upon it. I told him I certainly
â¢would insist upon it more strenuously
than upon any other plank in the plat
form. When the plank was about to be
read, however, he left the room and did
not return during its consideration. I
think the reason for his desertion of his
once favorite measure was that he re
ceived no encouragement from the other
members of the committee, who had been
thoroughly canvassed and advised about
the matter. Allen W. Thurman of Ohio
was one of our champions and Senator
Tillman, he of the pitchfork-tongue, was
also a member of the committee and eager
to lash any friend of the monopoly who
might raise his voice there. Congressman
Robertson of Louisiana was a member of
the sub-committee and rendered us great
service. James G. Maguirk.
LEANDERS WIN AGAIN.
New College Beaten in the Fifth
Heat for the Grand Chal
lenge Cup.
A Splendid Race, the Losers Being
On y Half a Length
Behind.
HENLEY- ON - THE -THAMES, Exg.,
July B.â The principal events of the pro
gramme of the Royal Henley regatta to
day were the second trial beats of the
eight-oared c ntest for the grand chal
lenge cup and the single scull contest for
diamond sculia to determine which crews
and individual oarsmen shall row iv the
final heat in each race to-morrow.
The fourth heat in the race for the Grand
Challenge cup having been a bye for the
Thomas Rowing Club, the fifth neat of
that race was tLe first of tliat series to con
tested to-aay, between the Leander Row
ing Cub and the crew of New College,
Oxford, the two crack teams in the list of
entries for the Grand Challenge cup.
In spite of the magnificent showing
made by the Leanders against the Vales
yesterday, the New College m^n were the
favorites Tlie New College men started
first at a stroke ot 22 to 43. Leander rowed
at a stroke ranging from 21 to 42.
The New College boat had a clear lead
in a minute, having kept in front irom the
stroke. Then was space between the
boats at the Rectory, and New College was
a length and a quarter ahead at the half
mile, a lead which was maintained until
tÂ£e boats reached Fawley Court. The
first half of the course was rowed over by
New College in 3:20.
Passing Fawley Court Leander began to
spirt and drew up level with the Oxford
men at the mile post. Then the nose of j
1 he Leanders' boat showed in front, and at
the Isthmian waa tnree-quartersof a length
ahead. Passing the Isthmian the New
College crew made a grand spurt, but the
Bucks side favored the Leander boat, and
in the desperate (rial of speed and endur
ance for the finish the finer form of the
Leander men was clearly apparent, the
latter boat crossing the finish line half a
length ahead in 7:06.
Both crews were pretty well pumped.
The New College men were the worst
winded, however, and it was some minutes
before they recovered.
The race was a splendid one and both
crews were cheered, the Leanders of course
receiving the larger share of applause.
The sixth heat of tne race for the dia
mond sculls between R. K. Beaumont of
the Burton-on-Trent Rowing Club and
Dr. W. S. McDowell of the Delaware
Boat Club of Chicago, who beat the Hon.
E. A. Guinness of Eton College so easily
yesterday, was regarded as of especial im
portance in view of the fact that if the
doctor should vanquish Beamont as easily
as he did Guinness he would stand
a good chance of capturing the
diamond trophy from the Hon. Rupert
Guinness, the holder of the diamond
sculls and the only other survivor of the
trial heats. The result snowed that there
vras little ground for apprehension that
the trophy would be won by an American,
for McDowell was beaten witn as great if
not greater ease than he beat Guinness
yesterday.
In the Grand Challenge cup heat be
tween the Thames Rowing Club and the
first Trinity Hall eight Trinity got away
first, rowing a stroke of from 21 up to 41,
Thames' stroke running from 21 to 40.
Trinity was a canvas ahead at the top of
Temple Island and at the half mile had
increased the lead to half a length.
Thames then began to draw up, and
passing Trinity was leading by half a
length" at the Fawley Court boathouse.
from this point the Thames boat went
away clear of Trinity and held her lead to
the finish, winning by a bare length in
7:29.
In the heat for the diamond sculls be
tween Vivian Nickails and the Hon. Ru
pert Guinness, the latter crossed tl.e finish
line four lengths ahead in 9:19.
The sixth beat for the ladies' plate was
won by the Eton Collece crew, who beat
the Radley College boat easily.
The fourth heat of the Wyfold challenge
cup was won by the crew of Trinity Col
lege, Oxford, who beat the Caius College
crew easily.
The second heat for the stewards' chal
lenge cup was won by the Thames Rowing
Club, which beat Magdalen College, Ox
ford, by a length and a half.
The first heat of the pair-oared, raced for
the Nickails challenge cud (silver goblet),
was a row over for E. W. Ecrum and C. M.
Pittman of New College.
The fifth heat for the Thames challenge
cup was won by Emanuel College, Cam
bridge, which beat the Kensington Row
ing Club easily.
In the fourth heat for the Wyfold cup,
the London Rowing Club beat the Long
ston Rowing Club a length and a half.
The fourth heat, for the Thames chal
lenge cup. was won by the Societe d'En
courageinent crew of Paris, which beat the I
crew of Trinity College, Dublin, by half a ',
length.

SAN LUIS OBISPO FIRE.
A Great Conflagration Sweeps
Through the Business
Section.
Property Valued at Upward of $80,000
Destroyedâ The Entire Town
in Danger.
SAN LUIS OBIBPO. Cal., July 9â '2 a. m.
Fire is raging in the business section of
the town. Cohen & Peyran's paintstore,
the old Central Hotel, the Hutcbinson
block and the Bell photograph gallery
have been destroyed and the Henderson
block is burning. If the flames are not
checked at this building all of the struc
tures covering an entire block of land will
be destroyed, as they are all of wood.
The loss already exceed-! $80,000, and if
the buildings now threatened are not
saved, it will be over $250,000. The entire
town is in danger of destrnction.
The conflagration started shortly after
11 o'clock in the rear of Cohen <fe Peyran's
paintstore, on Main street. It gained con
siderable headway before streams of water
could be turned on, owing to the inade
quate water supply.
This was a large two-story building. It
was soon in ashes, and the flames spread
to the old Central Hotel, another large
building. The inmates had but little time
in which to save their valuables, and at
midnight the walls of the hotel had fallen.
The Hutchinson block adjoining, occu
pied by Ping Brothers as a liquor-store,
soon followed the hotel as food for the
flames. The Bell photograph gallery, a
one-story structure, was destrayed.
The flames are now raging in tne Hen
derson block, and there is little likelihood
that it will be saved.
A hole has been burned through the
side of the Brooks block, a brick structure
occupied as a dry-goods store. The stock
is partially consumed.
The firemen are battling bravely to stay
the conflagration, but the intense heat
drives them back.

Chicago, 111., July 8.)
The California Democratic delegation
has got in good shape to do some excellent
work for Senator Stephen M. White, in
case the presidential nominee is to be a
dark horse.
Mr. White is on very friendly terms with
Senator Hill and the entire New York del
egation- Moreover, he has not antagon
ized in any way the other delegations. He
is so popular that after he had been called
out and notified that he had been made
chairman of the National Convention, he
was on his return apprised that he had
been made chairman of the committee on
resolutions. He was obliged to decline
the latter honor while accepting the
former. He has been assured also that
the New York delegation stands ready to
give him its entire vote if it is sure that it
would not beat him. There are many Cal
ifornians to-night who believe he will
eventually be nominated for President.
Mr. White to-day presided for a time
over the big conventio n and made an ex
cellent impression. The split of the Cali
fornia delegation on its vote on the Michi
gan contested delegations will do Mr.
White no injury, but will, if anything, aid
him in his ambition to get the Presidential
nomination.
The friends of W. J. Bryan, the boy
orator of the "Platte," had been hoping
that the lightning would strike in his
vicinity. Bryan is very diplomatic. He
is so popular at home that when his dele
gation was seated the other Nebraska dele
gation, which was for gold and which bad
been sent here through the political work
of J. Sterling Morton, made no objection,
but accepted the situation and quietly de
parted. It does not seem possible, how
ever, that Bryan is well enough known to
figure in a large way as a Presidential
possibility. As a Western man White is
apparently stronger than Bryan, and he
may be stronger than either Bland or
Boies.
Senator White occupied the chair of the
convention during the whoie of the fore
noon at the requestor Senator Daniel, who
was very tired. He showed great skill and
ability ac a presiding officer and has in a
quiet way made a lot of friends.
A striking feature of the city ani of
the convention are the gold and sil
ver hats that are exhibited. They
are of the stovepipe variety and are
glossed to represent the favored met
al of the wearer. Many of the silver
hats are worn, but the gold hats are as yet
in the stores and store windows, none
of the gold men having donned them. The
Brice men are sporting imitation silver
dollars from the gilt ribbons on their
breasts, while the Bland followers of silver
â there is an army liere, mainly from Mis
souri â wear big white caps on which is
the word "Bland" in silver letters an inch
and a half long. There are many sorts of
badges, and banners innumerable, all
built to secure attention and further the
different booms.
Chicago is as busy as usual chasing the
nimble dollar. Restaurant prices have in
a great many cases been raised, old signs
having been removed, thus giving the pro
prietors a chance to size up their custom
ers and charge all the tariff will bear.
Consumers of beer have been stocked
to find the price raised from the
humble nickel a glass to 15 cents a glass or
a quarter for two. Any kind of a room
commands the biggest kind of money.
The city is so thronged with visitors that
many have been forced into the garrets
of the disreputable lodging-houses. Rob
beries are frequent there, and the daily pa
pers are full of the accounts of them each
morning. The agile footpad and the pick
pocket are also both well in evidence.
There was never a better 'place probably
for holding a National Convention than
the monster Coliseum at Jackson Park.
It is capable of holding 20,000 people and
is comfortable, well arranged and has an
abundance of light and air. The acoustic
features are admirable.
In the Palmer, Sherman, Great North
ern, Auditorium and other hotels to-night,
as for many nigh Is previous, great throngs
are gathered. Knots of men vociferously
debate the respective merits of gold and
silver. The speeches are red hot and acri
monious.
There was the biggest crowd in the Col
iseum to-day that has ever gathered
there. The building was almost com
pletely filled, big as it is.
I do not believe that Hill, Whitney and
Flower, Mailed diplomats and tacticians
as they are, will be able to swerve the sil
ver advocates from the lines they have
mapped out. C. M. Cok.

MONTEREY, Cal., July 8.-It would
be hard to realize to-night that this old
town has recently been the scene of a most
interesting and exciting celebration.
Where there were a thousand neopie on
the streets last night there is only one to
night.
Quiet reigns where all was noise and
hilarity and Monterey has gone to sleep
again. Now that statistics are to be had
it is shown that at least 25,000 people at
tended the celebration. Tnis vast crowd
was handled so skillfully that at no time
was there confusion in their coming and

8o great became the volume of sound
and so widespread the confusion that
Grant, Hinckley and the man who was
the object it of allâ David B. Hillâ who had
sat quietly and calmly in his chair while
the tumult raged, finally appealed by voice
and gesture for quiet and order. But they
might as well have argued or attempted to
subdue so many Comanche Indians, and
though things became quieter for an in
stant when Chairman Daniel endeavored
to make a statement, the multitude seemed
even to gain greater vehemence by their
brief pause, and yelled and waved with
such heartiness that the demonstration
went beyond its former bounds.
Governor Altgeld rose to speak, but he
was shouted down, and Hisses commingled
wit.i the shouting. Grant and the New

the tumult, and finally order waÂ« restored.
The second demonstration was a repeti

counter charge of the siiver men. They

CONVENTION HALL, CHICAGO, Ilu,
July B.â There was no repetition this
morning of the offensive scenes of yester
day so far as admission to the convention
hall was concerned. By order of the tem
porary clairman, Senator Daniel of Vir
ginia, just before adjournment last even
ing, the doors were opened at 9a. m. and
all persons having the right of entry â
delegates, alternates and holders of
ticketsâ were admitted as soon as they
presented themselves. In that way the
sergeant-at-arms escaped the curses which
fell thick upon him yesterday from the
thousands who were victims of his stupid
order to keep the doors closed till the last
moment The rows of. spectators' scats
were soon filled without pushing, con
fusion or display of ill - temper, and
delegates and alternates had no difficulty
in reaching their several sections. The
weather, which had been rather chilly for
some days past, was sunny and bright
this morning and there was a delightful
freshness in the air.

The business of the convention was to
have begun at 10 a. m., but punctuality is
not the cardinal virtue of such assemblies,
and for an hour after that time the thou
sands of spectators were entertained more
pleasantly with musical selection;, inter
spersed with choruses, performed by an
excellent band stationed in the gallery
back of the platform.
There were but few demonstrations in
recognition of public favorites as they en
tered the hall. One of them was startedâ
with not much spirit or enthusiasm â for
Bryan of Nebraska, "the boy orator of the
Platte," who. with his fellow-silver dele
gates from that State, had gained a point
by the report of the committee on creden
tials admitting them and excluding their
gold contestants.
At a few minutes before 11 the tempo
rary chairman called the convention to
order and announced that its proceedings
would be opened with prayer by the Rev.
Thomas Edward Green, rector of Grace
Episcopal Church, Cedar Rapids, la. At
this time the section of the New York
delegates was still unoccupied.
The prayer called for a special "blessing
on this convention, gathered from a.ll over
our fair land," and asked that the minds of
the delegates should be "dominated for
good, for humanity and for God," and that
what they did might "tell in the years to
come for the advancement and lifting up
of our human kind."
Senator White, permanent chairman
elect, relieved Senator Dan el of the gavel
and presided over the informal procedins;s
of the convention which followed, Mr.
Daniel being in poor voice after his exer
tions of yesterday.
The chairman announced that the first
business in order was the report of com
mittees, as no business could be done ex
cept by unanimous consent until the com
mittees reported. He called the first com
mittee in order, the committee on creden
tials, and there was no response, and after
an interval of about ten minutes it was an- j

nou need that the committee on credentials
was about to reassemble after their long
night's session.
At 11:12 ex-Senator Martin of Kansas
was recognized and moved an informal
recess of five minutes to permit G/overnor
Hogg of Texas to address the convention.
Governor Hogg began by sajring thia
should be a proud occasion for every Amer
ican citizen. He advocated the/cultivation
of a spirit of friendliness in order to win
the victory next November. Every Demo
crat in the United States should lay aside
his prejudices ana march with his rival
brother against the common enemy, the
Republican party [cheers], which was
pleading in glittering generalities ana
promising better behavior if the people
would only try them again. Their fight
should not now be waged with each other,
but with the common foe. If Democrats
only united they could carry consterna
tion, disaster and defeat into the Republi
can ranks. [Cheers.]
He assailed the Republican doctrine of
protection and bounties, and said the Re
publican party proposed to destroy labor
organizations, and had organized syndi
cates and trusts for that purpose. It
proposed, through the use of the Federal
courts, backed by Federal bayonets, to
strike down and overawe those labor or
ganizations. In condemning the Republi
can party for its declaration in regard to
gold and silver. Governor Hogg ex
claimed in tones of indignation:
"Are you Americans or are you truck
ling sycophants, winning smiles from for
eign crowns?"
Governor Hogg's ''five minutes" were
stretched into half an hour, but still there
were no tidings of the committee on cre
dentials, and, amid vociferous cries for
"Hill,'' who was not present, the chairman
recognized Senator-elect Money of Mis
sissippi, who moved that Senator Black
burn of Kentucky be invited to the stand.
Mr. Blackburn, the first pronounced caa
34
didate to be heard, was received with
tumultuous applause. Senator Blackburn
said:
"Democrats- of America have gathered
here to do an important work. They are
charged with a great duty. The vast ma
jority of the American people are suffer
ing and look to this convention to correct
their grievances and to right their wrongs.
You have opened this campaign in splen
did style, State by State. You have swept
over the skirmish line; you have come
here instructed by an overwhelming ma
jority of your party and your pebple.
There can be no doubt as to where your
duty lies. You are here to meet the rea
sonable expectations of your people. They
don't need to be told, because they know,
that they are to-day the victims of vicious
and unjust legislation. They know and
they have instructed you to declare that
they will no longer submit tamely to the
class legislation under which they have
groaned for twenty years. Thoy have not
gent you here to quarrel among your
selves. Lot us take no action that 'a not
tempered with the fullest measure of fair
ness. Let us declare to the world that
which we approve and that which we dis
approve.
"Let us promulgate a platform which
neither human nor devilish ingenuity can
subject to more than one construction ; let
us declare that we are here to promulgate
a platform that shall be in line and con
sonance with the oft-repeated declaration
of our party, and that shall not obscure or
deflect public attention from the one main
issue upon which this contest turns. Let
uÂ« declare what we approve and what we
disapprove. Let us declare that we want
to unlock the doors of the American mint,
and that we mean to put silver back where
it was before. [Cheers.] That we mean
the unrestricted, the unlimited free coin
age of both pold and silver on even terms,
without discrimination and without the
slightest regard to the action of any other
power on this earth. [Cheers.] Let us
declare further that the Democratic party
does not approve the issue of 'coin bonds'
in a time of profound peace. Let us de
clare that we don't approve of giving the
right of option to the men who hold the
obligations, but the men who owe them;
let us declare that we don't approve but
condemn the proposition of retiring the
non-interest-bearing legal tenders, green
backs and treasury notes.
"Let us declare further that we are not in
favor of perpetuating either a national
debt or a national banking system. You
cannot persuade the American people to
believe that the depressed condition of
their industries is not the result of vicious
legislation. You cannot make them be
lieve that the fires have gone out in their
furnaces, that the spindles have ceased to
hum in their factories, that the farmer is
no longer able to get the cost of produc
tion for his productc, and that a million
unemployed laborers are to-daj* tramping
the highways of the country, while the
laws under which they live are equitable
and fair. They know better. It seems to
me, my countrymen, that the correction
of thes6 evils is the duty which devolves
upon this great Democratic nation. The
eyes of the country, the eyes of tue world
rest fixed and centered on this hall of as
sembled Democrats. [Cheers.]
"If prosperity is to be brought back to
take the place of poverty, if happiness is
to be given once more to the American
people; if free institutions are to be safe
picketed and anchored in the hearts of our
people, it will only be when the banner
under which you gather here floats out
once more in proud triumph from the
dome of our country's capitol. [Cheers.]
It is in your hands to give this boon to
the American people. Be temperate; be
conservative, but be manly and brave. Do
not fail to gather the fruit 3of the splendid
victory which you have already inaugu
rated. You have carried the outer
trenches, but the inner citadel is to be con
tended for in November. Let us do noth
ing except with an honest effort to sus
tain the sentiment of the people behind
us. I appeal to every Democrat, whether
he be with the majority or with the
minority, wbetner he be for a single
standard or for a double standard, to re
member, in God's name, that he is a Dem
ocrat still. [Applause.] I pin my faith
to the principles and loyalty of my party.
""Remember, my countrymen, that for
twenty years we have waged the fight, un
awed by power, stubbornly contesting
every inch of ground, and now we are on
the eve of the fruition of our hopes. We
read without doubt or uncertainty the
restoration of the Democratic party to
power. By all the sacred traditions that
gather about our party, by all the hopes
that nerve us for the future, appealing to
your loyalty, appealing to your patriot
ism, appealing to your courage and to
your love of country, I beg of you, fellow-
Democrats, to make a platlorm that shall
tell the truth and rally as one man to vin
dicate its fairness." [Applause.]
As Mr. Blackburn sat down more cries
were raised for Hill, without response.
A motion to adjourn for half &n hour
was voted down and the band was started
up to drown the confusion which pre
vailed.
Mr. Henry of Mississippi moved that
the Hon. W. J. Bryan of Nebraska be in
vited to the stand. This was received with
every demonstration of approval, but the
cbair announced that Mr. Bryan was not
in the hall.
Governor Altgeld of Illinois wu then
called for, and rising in the body of the
hall the Governor indicated a desire to
give away to Senator Hill. The chair
stated that Senator Hill was engaged with
the committee on resolutions and was not
in the hall.
Governor David Overmeyer of Kansas
took the stand and declared that the seat
ot empire was transferred from the Atlan
tic States to the Mississippi Valley. The
day of the common people had dawned
and the "dollar of our daddies" would be
restored. This sentiment was received
with unbounded enthusiasm.
The band once more filled up the inter
lude to kill time.
Governor Altgeld was again called into
requisition as a stop gap. His swarthy
visage, as it appeared alongside the chair
man, was greeted with cheers, to which he
responded by saying he did not come here
to make a speech, but to assist in nomi
nating a President and preparing a plat
form which should bring hope to the
people. He was listened to with attention
as be proceeded to discuss the cause of the
existing conditions of distress, which
he summarized as the combined action
of the moneyed interests of the world
to make money dear and property
and labor cheap. The first step in this
plan was to strike down silver. This
doubled the work of gold and doubled its
purchasing power. The consequence was
that prices were oniy half as high as when
we had both metals, and it took all the
farmer could raise to pay his fixed
charges â bis interest and his taxes. The
farmer was prostrated, the merchant and
the railroads did less business and the
laborer was out of employment. Shall we
continue this system, lie asked, or go
back to where we were before? and a loud
chorus of "noes" was the result. Shall we
ko on, he added, paying interest of 200
--cent dollars, or go back and pay in 100
--cent dollars? That was the great question
before the convention. He characterized
the Republican Convention as "Mr- Mark
Hanna's trust." At that convention
Hanna nominated a man with one idea
and that idea wrong. [Laughter.] That
convention adopted a single-gold standard
and the English money-lenders approved
it. Englishmen were always delighted
with anything that tended to get more
blood and more sweat out of the American
people. [Renewed lauchter and cheers.]
The same men were here trying to pull
the same halter upon us.
"Are you going to stand it?" he in
quired, and again the response was a
vigorous "no." Another point loudly
cheered was when he declared: "We will
have no straddling on platform and no
straddling on candidates. Those gentle
men who have to consult the tin roosters
when they get up in the morning in order
to see what their opinions are for the day
have no show in this convention."
The hand of compromise, he said, never
yet ran up the flag of freedom. No com
promise army ever Xought the battle of
liberty.
As he retired from the stand he was
greeted with loud cheers.
George Fred Williams of Massachusetts
was next called upon and was greeted
with a cry of "Three cheers for George
Fred Williams." He combated the as
sertion that the seat ot empira had been
transferred from the Atlantic Coast to the
Mississippi Valley. The seat of empire
was where it ever was in ell the States of
the Union, and the battle now being waged
was for the restoration of the union of the
States. He begged there might be no
other word of sectionalism heard in this
convention. The fight was not to transfer
the seat of empire from the East to the
West, but to transfer the control of the
treasury and of your money and mine
from Lombard street to the centers of in
dustry in the United States. [Loud
cheers.]
At this point (1 p. m.) the chair an
nounced a partial report of the committee
on credentials, recommending that each
of the Territories and the District of Co
lumbia be granted six votes.
After careful comparison of the cre
dentials as returned by the National
Committee, they found .all of them correct
except those from the States of Nebraska
and Michigan. In regard to Nebraska
they were pleased to report that the dele
gates headed by Hon. W. J. Bryan should
be admitted to seats. In regard to Michi
gan, they asked further time.
Mr. Manoney of Nebraska rose in the
body of the hall and gracefully offered to
vacate the seats now occupied by the sit
ting members for the benefit ol their suc
cessful contestants. The motion to adopt
the report was declared carried by a viva
voce vote, a demand for a rollcail, which
was at first made by Governor Russell,
being withdrawn on the statement of the
chairman of the credentials committee
that the report was unanimous.
At 1:10 the gold delegation from Ne- j
braska retired to a march tune by the band
and their silver successors took their
places. The Bryan men as they marched
in headed by silver-tipped spears and a
banner bearing Mr. Bryan's name in silver
letters, were vociferously applauded.
Shortly afterward Senator Daniel (at 1:18)
resumed the chair and Governor Ben Till
rnan of South Carolina was invited to ad
dress the convention. The reply was
made, however, that the Governor was in
attendance on the meeting of the commit- i
tee on credentials.
At 1:37 Mr. Altgeld moved that the con
vention take a recess till 5 o'clock. The
proposition met with loud shouts of dis
approval. Thereupon the chairman (Sen
ator White of California) stated that it
had become manifest that there would be
no report from the committee on creden
tials for some time and that the motion
just made *vas the result of that fact.
Mr. Flnlay of Ohio moved that the re
port of the committee on permanent or
ganization be now read and that the con
vention proceed to its permanent organi
zation, leaving the report of the commit
tee on credentials to be disposed of subse
quently.
The chair ruled that as there was no
permanent roll of the body there could be
no declaration of a permanent organiza
tion. He then put the question on the
motion for a recess and declared it carried.
So the convention took a recess till 5 p. m.
W. J. Bryan of Nebraska, who is con
sidered by many the possible compromise
candidate for the Presidency, was early
upon the floor of the convention in the
afternoon and was cluing missionary work
among the delegates. His face was
wreathed in smiles when he was greeted by
a United Press reporter.
"Nebraska has won a big victory so far,"
said Mr. Bryan. "The financial plans as
drawn up by the committee on resolutions
is identical with the one adopted by the
Nebraska State Convention in 1894 and
which was written by myself."
The Nebraska men used this as an argu
ment during the afternoon with the dele
gates in their endeavor to secure votes for
Mr. Bryan. Mr. Bryan personally circu
lated a petition about the ha!l for signa
tures indorsing the Monroe doctrine.
The convention reassembled at 5:30 p. m.
with a full attendance of delegates and
crowded galleries.
Senator Daniel of Virginia was in the
chair as temporary chairman. The sec
tion assigned to the New York delegates
was, however, an exception to the general
rule, very few of the members of that dele
gation being present. Senator Hill, Gov
ernor Flower and Mr. Whitney were con
spicuously absent. Perry Belmont hov
ered around as though be had no particu
lar liking for his surroundings. There
appeared to be no business ready for pre
sentation and the band tilled up the time to
the general enjoyment and satisfaction.
Senators Harris of Tennessee, Coclcrell
of Missouri, Jones of Arkansas and Till
man of South Carolina, with ex-Senator
Reagan of Texas, moved around uneasily
from section to section. At 5:30 o'clock
an oriier went forth through the sergeant- ,
at-arms that the committee on permanent
organization would meet in its room im
mediately, and the audience amused itself j
for some time with calls for Bryan, but
these calls met with no response.
At 5:40 Senator Hill, followed by many
members of the New York delegation,
came into the hall and was immediately
recognized and greeted with cheers and
shouts of "Hill!" "Hill!" No notice of !
this demonstration was taken by him, but i
be and his companions quietly took their
seats.
Soon afterward Colonel John R. Fellows
came in from another quarter of the hall
and joined his associates. He was not
recognized by the crowd, and consequently
'nvas allowed to take his seat quietly.
In an aisle in close proximity to the New
York section, there was at this time a
group of distinguished politicians in an
apparently earnest and anxious colloquy.
The group consisted ot Senators Harris,
Jones and Tillman and Governor Stone of
Missouri.
At o:50 the committee on credentials
presented its complete report, admitting j
to seats the contesting silver delegates
from the Fourth Congressional District of
Michiganâ Messrs. Chamberlain and Hart;
also admitting the contesting delegates
from the Ninth Congressional District of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1896.
Michigan, ; Messrs. Hoyt ; and White, and
recognizing the right to their seats of all
the other delegates from Michigan. " ; .
. Mr. Crosby of Massachusetts explained
that this meeting had lasted nearly all
night and most of the day. - The minority
felt it ' should be known that in their
opinion the report was a great injustice.
Mr. Crosby's voice was very wean and he
spoke with a running accompaniment of
cries of ,V Louder" ana derisive applause,
most of his remarks .being v delivered in
dumb show. He closed by offering an
amendment to retain the fonr unseated
members in their seats.
Brennan of Wisconsin also advocated
the adoption of the minority report and
said they feared the effect of the adoption
of the majority report upon the country.
He entered into details of the facts in
volved in _" the contest and said the' report
in this case, if adopted, would establish
the fact that a majority in the first flush
of success might go into a sovereign Slate
and upset the action of a legal convention.
[Cheers.] He charged the contest origin
ated only three or four weeks ago when
certain facts became apparent as to the
majority lin this convention. He had
since become acquainted with' that ma
jority, and he appealed with confidence to
their sense of justice and fairness. [Loud
cheers.]
Taylor of Arkansas, a member of the
committee on credentials, argued in favor 1
of the majority report and declared him-,
self in favor of the list of delegates from
the State of Michigan as prepared by the
National Committee.
Governor McLaurin of Mississippi, an
other member of the committee on cre
dentials, cave a history of the election of
delegates in Michigan, asserting that there
was a clear majority of Democratic votes
in that State in favor of silver, so that
there was no issue here to throttle the will
or to stifle the purpose of that majority of
Democrats. He spoke of the orders issued
from Washington to Federal office-holders
in Michigan to carry that State at all haz
ards for gold, and he said that it was a
question for the convention to decide
whether the men who represented the ma
jority of the Democrats of that State were
to be driven out of the convention.
Tue audience manifested impatience at
the length of Mr. McLaurin's explanation
and broke in with constant cries for a
speech from Hill, but notice was given
that if these interruptions were persisted
in the galleries would be cleared. The
threat was of little avail, for nardiy had
Governor McLaurin taken up the thread
of bis story again when the shouts for Hill
broke out afresh.
Then the serjeant-at-arms made the sol
emn proclamation: "Ladies and gentle
men : The chair has requested the sergeant
ac-arms to instruct the assistant sergeant
at-arms and the police department to
remove from the galleries any one who
disturbs the meeting, and he will carry out
the order."
McLaurin then brought his remarks to a
close.
Mr. Salusbury of Delaware opposed the
\ majority report. He said he had been
: elected on a 16 to 1 platform and he could
not conceive of the convention doing in
justice by unseating those who were duly
elected as delegates. [Cheers.]
Mr. Stevenson, member of the National
' Committee from Michigan, opposed the
j majority report, beginning his speech
with the statement: "I am the man
who, they say, stole Michigan. Even so.
[Laughter.] Ido not desire to discuss the
j financial question now, but to assert the
| rights of the delegates elected by a sov
-1 ereign' State to sit in a Democratic Na
'â  tional convention. [Cheers.] "
"The convention,'.' he added, "has no â 
j right to sit as a committee on credentials
ion a State convention. It may answer its
purpose now, but it will make a precedent
which will return to damn it some day.
[Cheers.] The only safe Democratic doc-
I trine is to stand by precedents, and to seat
the delegates who hold the only creden
tials that have been issued from those dis
tricts."
Ex-Lieutenant-Governor Sheehan, a
member of the National Committee, made
a statement to prove the impartiality of
! that committee on the various contested
election cases, and argued in opposition to
j the majority report of the committee on
credentials. ...*â â 
Mr. Sheehan referred to the fact that a
| poll of the Michigan delegation as it orig-
I inally stood showed 15 for gold and 13 for
' silver, and he disclosed the secrets of the
j committee-room by saying that at first the
| majority of the committee favored unseat
| ing all four of the delegates-at-lar^e ; but
wiser counsel prevailed and the delegates
at-large were retained. But the district
delegates had been unseated, and what
was the purpose? To make the delegation
15 silver to 13 gold, and thus open the way
j to the overthrow of the time-honored doc
trine of the two-thirds rule. â¢
Mr. Blake of Texas, a member of the
: committee on . credentials, argued in favor
!of the majority report. He said that on
1 principle he was opposed to going behind
. the returns, but in this case the evidence
' was abundant that the State Convention
i had been manipulated in the gold interest
! and the will of the people slighted. In
; his judgment the whole infernal delega
: tion from Michigan ought to be turned
out. [Cheers.] The committee on ere-
I dentials acted justly in reporting in favor
I of admitting ' the contestants from : the
Fourth and Ninth districts. You under
stand the question. Vote for the majority
report and you will do what is right.
[Applause.]
McKnight of Michigan, also . a member
of the committee on credentials, asked the
support, not only of the silver men, but of
the entire convention in support of the
report of the majority. He asserted the
State. of Michigan elected a majority of
200 to their convention in favor of silver
and when tae administration in Washing
ton found this out Mr. Stevenson was sent
to Michigan to upset the will of the peo
i ple..
'â¢There is not one word of truth in all
â  Chat," said Mr. Richardson from his seat.
As Mr. McKnight proceeded further
! with hid statement of alleged facts Mr.
Weadlock, one of the delegates at large,
seated in the front row and immediately
1 facing the speaker, said in an audible voice:
"That's a lie." No notice was taken of
this interruption.
Mr. McKnight closed by saying that if
â  the majority report was adopted the Demo
j crats would carry Michigan by at least
25,000 majority.
Mr. Brucker of Michigan declared that
he had always been a free silver man, and
that there were enough silver delegates in
the convention : to ' nominate 7 a â . President
by a . two-thirds majority without \ tie
necessity of committing highway robbery.
[Applause and laughter.] " -
C. S. Thomas of Colorado, a member of
the National Committee, next took the
stand, but the audience was becoming im
patient and raised loud cries of "vote."
He held it would be a mistake to attempt
to elect a Democratic â¢ President : by over
j turning the will of a sovereign State. He
I warned them that they could riot afford to
strike down the State "of Michigan simply
for the purpose of â¢ obtaining a : two-thirds
majority. BmR
" Mr. Powers of Utah, a 'member of the
committee on credential?, argued in sup
port of the majority report of that com
mittee, on the ground that the title of
the sitting delegates from the Fourth and
Ninth districts of Michigan was tainted
with fraud. It was not for the purpose of
having a silver majority in the convention
that he would exclude these men and seat
the coniestants in their places â because
they had a two- thirds majority already â
but because that action would be just and
right.
State Senator Thomas F. Grady of New
York spoke against the majority report.
He referred to the frequent statements in
the newspapers weeks ago that the Michi
gan delegates would be unseated for the
purpose of making the abrogation of the
two-thirds rule unnecessary, but he de
clared that the people of the United States
would not be deceived by. the action of
tbe convention in tnia matter.
At this point one of numerous very ob
tuse policemen stationed in the building
attempted to prevent the entrance of a
delegate, and a small-sized row and some
excitement prevailed, but the chairman
ordered the band to strike up, and the con
vention quieted down.
Resuming his remarks, Senator Grady
said it seemed his unfortunate fate never
to make a speech without raising some
kind of a row.
"My purpose in speaking," he contin
ued, "was to avoid a row. There must be
a row, if not here in some place else, if we
overturn a precedent which is a part of
party discipline itself by adopting this re
port."
The discussion was closed with two more
speechesâ one by Mr. Weadock of Michi
gan and the other by Mr. O'Donnel! of
Colorado. Little or no attention, how
ever, was paid to these speeches, as the
crowd in the galleries was quite turbulent
and could not be kept in order. The con
vention itself, as well as the spectators in
the galleries, was in a hurry to come to a
vote, and Mr.O'Donnell assisted that view
by moving the previous question on the
report The previous question was sec
onded. The chairman declared the pre
vious question ordered, and the rollcail of
States was beeun.
When New York's seventy-two votes
were announced ayeâ in favor of the mi
nority reportâ a tumultuous wave of cheer
ing broke over the assembly. The first
efforts of the chairman to repress the
manifestation by the use of his gavel were
met by a counter demonstration on the
part of the gold delegates, who, rising and
turning their backs to the chairman and
their faces to tbe immense crowds in the
galleries, waved hats and handkerchiefs
and stood on their chairs and gesticulated.
The galleries, evidently strongly anti
silver in sentiment, were not slow to re
spond, and unearthly sounds from 15,000
throats filled even the vast space of the
great hall. The Tammany yell was plainly
heard in every temporary lull. Then tbe
silver men began to hiss and stamp their
feet, and this made matters infinitely
worse. Senator Daniel's powerful voice,
much worn with service yesterday, called
the next State, "'North Carolina."
''North Carolina declines to vote until
she can be heard," replied the chairman of
the delegation.
State Chairman Hinckley, ex-Mayor
Grant and other prominent New Yorkers
vainly tried to stop the demonstration*
It went on uninterruptedly for fifteen
minutes, and was t arely silenced when
the rollcail was resumed.
When Pennsylvania was reached and
Chairman Harrity, mounting on a chair,
said, "Pennsylvania casts her 64 votes
aye,'* an attempt was made to renew the
demonstration, but it died away in a few
seconds, spectators and delegates being
almost tired out.
The vote was taken on tne minority
amendment, winch retains the sitting
members from the Fourth and Ninth dis
tricts of Michigan in their seats, and re
sulted in the rejection of the minority re
port. Ayes 368, noes 558, absent 3.
"The noes have it," said the chairman,
"and the amendment is lost."
It was now the silver men* turn, and
they yelled and wared hats and handker
chiefs and displayed Bland pictures and
made the night hideous for nearly as long
as the gold men, tbe galleries impartially
assisting.
During the jubilation by tbe silver men
two stout Kentucky delegates danced a
breakdown in the aisle at the rear of the
delegation, several others "patting" time
amid the wildest laughter. The official
detailed vote was as follows:
The chairiran put the question on the
majority report of the committee on cre
dentials and declared it adopted.
The report of the committee on perma
nent organization was then pre-ented by
Mr. Finley of Ohio, naming Senator White
of California as permanent president of
toe convention and Thomas J. Cogan of
Ohio as permanent secretary.
A question was put to Mr. Finley as to
whetder the State of Michigan has a rep
resentative on the national committee, as
reported, and it was answered in the
affirmative.
An amendment to the report was offered
in relation to t c appointment of dele
gates from Nebraska to the several com
mittees (substituting other names), and
the amendment was agreed to.
A motion was made to refer back to the
committee that portion of the report re
lating to committeemen from Michigan,
and it was agreed to.
With these exceptions the report was
adopted.
A committee of three was then appointed
to escort Senator White, the permanent
chairman to the chair, the committee con
sisting of Mr. Finley of Ohio, Mr. McCon
nell of Illinois and Senator Vest of Mis
souri.
Senator Daniel, in retiring from the tem
porary chairmanship, expressed his deep
sense of honor which he had enjoyed, and
introduced Mr. White as "the distingu
ished Senator from California. [Cheers.]
Senator White, on taking the chair,
â poke of tbe convention as an assemblage
of men from every State and Territory in
the Union, and said he was prepared to
extend full, equal, absolute and impartial
treatment to all. Every question before
the convention should be, he said, consid
ered carefully and deliberately, and when
the voice of the convention was crystal
lized into a judgment that judgment should
be b ; ndin>ron all true Democrats. [Cheers.]
"We differ, perhaps," he continued, "'on
vital issues. We meet in friendly con
test, presenting what seems to us proper
and rUht. We submit our views to the
canriid judgment of our brethren, and on
that judgment we will certainly rely. We
find in life numbers of instances of hopes
unrealized. Men of prominence pass
away, some to oblivion, others because
they are summoned to another shore, but
the Democratic party will not die, even
wher. we all have ceased to live. [Cheers.]
"When the differences that challenge
consideration to-ni.ht have passed into
history, the Democratic party â the puar
dian of the people's rightsâ will endure to
bless man. [Applause.] My ambition
and yours is but for a moment. Whether
I Bucceed, or whether you succeed, in im
pressing my views or your views on the
convention, seems now of supreme impor
tance, but will not seem so in the future.
In this council cnamber the Democratic
party looks for the vindication of its ex
istence. The people look to us here for
the righting of their wrongs and for the
defense of the constitution, the great bul
wark of our liberties.
"We are here to-night its best, its truest
and its most loyal defenders. There is no
sectionalism here â none whatever. Equal
and impartial justice to all this land, the
triumph of the people as exemplified and
expressed in Democracy is the object for
which we have assembled, and to carry
out that object I will consecrate my best
efforts." [Loud applause.]
Mr. Clark of Montana, rising in the
body of the ball, producing a silver gavel
from the mines of Montana, which he
tendered to the presiding officer in the
name of the delegation from that State.
The chairman remarked that in the ab
sence of objection he would feel com
pelled to accept this handsome token
from the Montana delegation. No objec
tion being beard the gavel was passed up
to the chairman.
Senator Jones of Arkansas, chairman of
the committee on resolutions, announced
that the committee on platform and reso
lutions would meet to-morrow at 9:30 a.m..
This was taken by tne heated and excited
audience as an indication of an immediate
adjournment, and for the second time in
the course of the day an incipient panic
partially developed. People in the gal
leries begun to move out with a rush, and
a corresponding movement was started on
the floor. Trouble might have ensued,
but the sergeant-at-arms, raising his big
voice, commanded his lieutenants to
"Stop those men."
When some degree of order had been
thus restored, a motion to adjourn until
10 a. m. to-morrow was declared carried,
and at 9:38 the second day's convention
ended.

OFFICERS' QUARTERS AT THE LEAGUE OF THE CROSS
ENCAMPMENT.
[Sketched for "The Call" by a member of "The Call's" art staff.}
To-night a council of war was held to let
the matter go over until to-morrow. This
was because some of the leading officers
desired to spend the evening in a drive up
the valley for a change of air and rations.
Cook Matteson's wound is not at all dan
gerous and he is getting alon-^ nicely.
Willie Long is gradually recovering his
equanimity. To-day he facetiously willed
his sword to Lieutenant Drady and hung
up a soiled necktie for the first man in the
guardhouse to-night.
The following formal proceedings for
the court-martial huve been drawn up:

the trial of sucb prisoners as may properly be
broufhtbefore.it. Detail for the court: Sur

The court met in pursuance of the foregoing
order, and shall proceed la arraign and try Pri
vate William Long on the following charges
and specifications:
Charge firstâ Attempt to murder; specifica- !
tion Iâ Tnat the said Private William Long of
Company A did, on the night of the 6th inst.,
with malice aforethought and the promptings
of the devil in bis heart, make a felonious !
and murderous attack on Al Matteson, a cook |
employed iv said camp, inflicting a saber stab |
on the forehead ofjthe said cook, Al Matteson. |
Specification 2â That the said Private Wil- '
liam Long of Company A, when asked by the i
sergeant of the guard why he assaulted said '
cook, said: "I saw his hea>i protrude from
under the hospital tent at 11 p. m., and as I
supposed that he intended to break the rules
of the camp by attempting to go outside the
limits of the camp at that hour, 1 made up my
mind he should not"; and when the said ser- '
geant of the guard told the said Private Long
of Company A that tne cook was asleep at the
time, he replied: "I thought he was awake,
for x saw his eyes aud mouth open."
The charges were drawn up by Captain j
H. P. Filgate. a typical Western soldier. '
who is well known in San Francisco mili- ;
tary circles, and is here assisting Major
Drady in giving the cadets military in- i
struct ion. Captain Filgatn occasionally
entertains the cadets around the campfire
at nignt with stories from his fund of ex
citing experiences on the plains of the
great West.
Surgeon and Major Mulligan went
through the dress parade last night, and
though be is accused of having been
coached beforehand, and having some of
the orders written on his cuffs, he ac- I
quitted himself in tine style.
Last night was one of unusual excite
ment in camp. A storekeeper in the
neighborhood announced that he had rec
ognized in a man whom be bad seen in
the vicinity eariy in the evening a sneak
thief and opium tiend. The story spread
quietly, and, as it was then dark, grand
rounds were made at once and the sentries
instructed to be exira vigilant The entire
camp seemed to feel as though it was I

! in the record of Camp Montgomery. The
challenges of the sentries could be heard
at all hours of the night, ihis morning
at reveille the camp was founa not to have
been carried away during the night and
nothing was missing.
The guardhouse had threa prisoners at
daybreak. Curiously enough the prison
ers were members of the guard them
selves, bu: they got in after reve lie. Two
donkeys stravtd into camp about that
time and the puards got on their backs
and proceeded to have fun with them.
The donkeys made a dash for liberty and
carried their riders outside the lines. Then
the other members of the guard, who had
failed to eaten the donkeys hrst, turned
tbe tables on their three comrades and
arres ed them. The three had no business
outside the lines. They were put into
the jruardhouse, where they were kept
until lone after the messes had had break
fast, when hey were released, but they
I prevailed upon kiml-hearted Cook Matte
! son who bad a narrow escape from death
from Private Willie Long'- saber thrust,
to find them something to eat.
The heat to-day was sweltering. It was
102 in the shade at noon. The shaded
swimming pool in the creek, a quarter of a
mile away, was congested with popula
tion after 3 o'clock in tde afternoon. The
reason that there is not more drilling and
hari work is that the atmosphere is too
tropical. L>r. Mulligan has prohibited
swimming between the hours of 11 a. m.
and 3 p. m. on account of the heat.
Major Drady and Captain Filgate say
tbe cadets are steadily improving in their
dri ling, soldierly bearing and conduct,
and there is no doubt that the encamp
ment will be profitable to them.
The sun has been destructive of all com
plexions, and a very brown, but a husky
and healthy lot of young men, will be
seen when they get back to she City next
Sunday night or Monday morning.
Preparations are being made for a large
crowd next Saturday, when members of
the Young Ladies' Institute will arrive,
and for military mass under the trees on
the arrival of the train at 9:30 Sunday
morning. A special drill and military ex
ercises will be given for the young ladies.
This afternoon a large "canopy was
stretched, under which mass will be said.
DIVORCED AT SEATTLE.
Dr. Dawson Wins His Suit for
a Separation From His
Pretty Wife.
The Defendant Is Awarded Present
Custody of the Children and Lib
eral A'imcny.
SEATTLE, Wash., July B.â The divorce
suit brought by Dr. Dawson against his
handsome wife came to a close to-night
when Judge Humes rendered a decision
giving the plaintiff an absolute divorce on
tbe ground of cruelty.
The custody of the children is awarded
to Mrs. Dawson until they shall be 8 years
of age, when, under the decision of the
court, they will be turned over to the
father. The Judge ordered that Dr. Daw
son pay his wife a goodly sum for alimony,
the amount to be fixed later by the court.
The verdict was a partial victory for the
defendant, in that the court granted the
divorce on the ground of cruelty, which
was supposed to be only a minor allegation
in the complaint. The court said that as
cruelty had been proved it formed suffi
cient ground for a decree of divorce.
Mrs. Daw'on, who was in the courtroom,
almost fainted from excessive joy when
the decision was announced. Tbe oue
great fight she made was for the posses
sion of the children, and shn won; for
when they are about to become eight years
of age nothing can prevent her leaving the
State and thus placing herself and the chit,
dren beyond tbe jurisdiction of the Supe
rior Court of King County.

FUNERAL OF THE VICTIMS.
Hundreds Fo'low Their Bodies to the
Graveâ Proving a Dead Han's
Guilt
MINNEAPOLIB, Minn., July B.â Scott
Richardson, the stepson of Mrs. H. R.
Richardson and stepbrother of Miss Ethel
Richardson, the women murdered in Mon-
scenes of TWo Tragedies in J^orvtecito, arvd Or\e of the principals.
Tfie likeness in the upper Uft-hand corner is that of Cyrus Barnard, killed while resist
ing arrest for the murder of Mrs. Richardson and her daughter, Ethel. The large residence
is the Richardson home, where the murders were committed. The smaller cottage was the
abiding place of Barnard. When the officers arrived to arrest him he met them at the door in
the rear and was there shot dead after firing twice at the men outside.
tecito, Cal., on Monday, has established
an alibi which removes the suspicion di
rected against him because of his known
enmity to the unfortunate pair during
their lifetime. The fact that he was in
Minneapolis to-day proves that the man
seen lurking about the Richardson
grounds Monday evening, and whom the
California officers believe to have been an
accomplice of the murderer, was some one
other than Scott Richardson. A careful
investigation by Detective N. Smith
proves that an injustice was unintention
ally done the man when the authorities
looked upon him as the possible slayerjof
his relatives.
Richardson was found by a Call corre
spondent to-day, and gave an accounting
of his recent movements.
"1 left California, where my wife and
myself had visited with the old folks, one
year ago last April," said he, "and I have
seen nothing of them since. Since my re
turn I have been in Dub uq tie and in Wis
consin. This man Barnard that the dis
patches speak of I don't know and I can
not recall that I ever heard of him. They
must have hired him after I left there.
"The first I heard of the affair was to
day. I have been working for the county,
and on Tuesday afternoon I left home
about 4 o'clock ana went to Eden Prairie
to goto work. I had not been gone over
ha!f an hour before my wife received a
telegram concerning the matter. The
telegram was from Sheriff Hicks, whom I
know well personally, as I was there at
the time he was elected Sheriff. My wife
knew of no way to get word to me, and she
went and spent the night with her sister,
Mrs. Smithers, at the Laurel Flats. This
morning they hired a team and drove over
to Eden Prairie, where I was working. I
came to town and at once wired to Hicks.
"I have a well-to-do brother-in-law re
siding in Boston, and I guess he will go
out there to look after the property inter
ests, as there is no one left there now.
All I know about the affair is what I have
read in the papers, beyond my telegram
from Hicks. My stepmother was about
57 years old, I guess, and Ethel was about
16."
Richardson does not state whether he
would be benefited in a financial way by
the death of the mother and daughter,
but does not appear to believe he would.
A DEAD MAN.
Officrrt Determining the Guilt or Inno
cence of Barnard.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., July B.â An
extraordinary struggle is in progress in
Santa Barbara. All day long a jury has
sat in a cheery office, the target of a cu
rious multitude's eyes, trying to deter
mine the guilt or innocence of a man who
iies stark and stiff in an adjoining room,
unable to utter a word in his own defense;
unable to prove an alibi; unable to make a
full and free confession of the horrible
crime and perchance to extenuate himself
by telling of some unexpected circum
stances which will now never be told, and
which converted the sneaKing pilferer into
a murderer. Hour by hour the network of
testimony grows stronger, and those who
at first looked with pity upon the dwarfish
corpse are becoming more and more con
vinced that Cyrus Barnard was the butcher
who took the lives of defenseless Mrs.
Richardson and her pretty daughter,
Ethel, at Montecito on Sunday night.
Cyrus Barnard was a man without any
near or warm friends. His was not Â£. na
ture or character calculated to inspire re
spect or affection, yet the love of fair play
is so strong in men that those who in his
lifetime viewed him contemptuously and
only tolerated him as a companion or ac
quaintance have united in a zealous en
deavor to bring forward every particle of
honest testimony that can be found in his
behalf.
To-day's testimony was, much of it, a
mere repetition of that produced at the
Mrs. Richardson inquest yesterday. The
only new point made seems to have been
the discovery of Barnard's missing "jump
ers" and overalls hanging in his step
father's barn. Every garment that the
dead man possessed his wardrobe was
a meager one) now seems to have been
accounted for, and there is no blood to be
found upon anything save that which
flowed from the wound in his own breast.
Dr. Hall has taken Barnard's knife for a
microscopic examination. Although the
blade, which was supposed to fit the
wound in Ethel Richardson's throat, had
been recently cleaned the crevice where
the nail is inserted to open it is still dirty,
and Dr. Hall declares that if it was used
in the butchery there will be corpuscles of
human blooa there. Upon this examina
tion much devolves and upon its result
may depend the question of the dead
man's guilt.
At an early hour this afternoon a mourn
ful cortege started from a local under
taker's to the Richardson home in Monte
cito. In the lead was a hearse bearing the
body of Ethel Richardson, in a pure-white
casket, on which lay a floral-piece, con
tributed by her classmates. In the sec-
ond was the dark wood coffin containing
her mother's remains. The. pall-bearers
of the young girl were her boy classmates
in the High School. All Montecito and
hundreds of Santa Barbara people bad as
sembled. The grounds of the pretty villa
were thronged and the road was lined
with carriages.
The Rev. Dr. Dodge of Montecito read a
brief service on the doorsteps, the caskets
were replaced in the hearses, and a great
procession moved to the cemetery just
below, where all that was mortal of the
unfortunate victims was placed to rest on
the sunny slope of the bluff overhanging
the sea.
Sheriff Hicks yesterday received a dis
patch from the express company by which
Scott Richardson is employed, in Minne
apolis. It gave Richardson's address. He
immediately sent a dispatch to Richard
son informing him oi the crime, with in
structions that it should be delivered to
him in person, and to notify him if it was
delivered. This afternoon the office has
received the following notice from Minne
apolis :
Yours of the 7th, to Scott Richardson, signed
Thomas H. Hicks, was receipted for by Scott
Richardson 6:20 p. m., 7th. Union agent.
This completely does away with the
theory that Richardson was here on Sun
day night and committed the double mur
der, getting away without being detected.
The following telegram was received
late in reply to an inquiry addressed by
' the Sheriff to the Chief of Police in Minne
apolis :

FRANCAS AT ALBANY.
Mrs. Everett Horsewhips a Neighbor and
Shoots at an Officer Who Tries
to Arrest Her.
ALBANY, Ok.. July B.â Mrs. Frank
Ketchum and Mrs. Thomas, her neighbor,
were exchanging current gossip in the
former's yard to-day. Mrs. May Everett,
who lives near by, witnessed the confab
and imagined they were talking about her.
Armed with a bucket of water, she ap
proached tbe pair and dashed the water
into Mrs. Thomas' face. The latter re
monstrated, but Mrs. Everett's ire was
aroused. She went home, procured a
horsewhip, returned and again attacked
Mrs. Thomas.
George Carnese, who owns a trained bull
dog, happened to pass by. His dog, hav
ing been accustomed to play with a whip,
rushed in and took the whip away frcm
the an^ry woman, and thus ended the
fracas.
A warrant for the arrest of Mrs. Everett
was issued, and Constable Blount pro
ceeded to the Everett residence to place
her under arrest. Mrs. Everett had the
door securely locked and refused to admit
the officer. He broke through the door,
and was met by a very angry woman,
armed with a repeating rifle. When he
attempted to enter she shot at him. For
tunatoly she was a poor markswoman.
The officer rusUed forward and the woman
fired again just as he seized the rifle bar
rel. The shot passed harmlessly between
his arm and body. The weapon was a 22
--caliber Winchester rifle, but was plenty
large enough to have resulted in a rauraer
had her aim not beenfaulty. Mrs. Everett
ia in jail.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1896.
JAPAN'S LOSS BY
THE TIDAL WAVE.
The Victims Believed to
Number More Than
100,000.
MANY CITIES LEVELED.
Nearly 40,000 Bodies Buried in
the Miyas Gi and Iwate
Prefectures.
FREAKS OF THE PHENOMENON.
Ships Carried Inland and Deposited
in Fields Far From the
Shore Line.
VICTORIA, B. C, July 8.-The steamer
Braemer arrived from the Orient this
morning and brought news up to June 22.
It has additional details concerning the
recent tidal wave. There were 14,970 people
killed and 4586 houses destroyed by the
wave in the Miyas Gi prefecture, and in
the Iwate prefecture 22,186 perished, while
1244 were injured and 5030 houses de
stroyed, making a total in the two pre
fectures of 37,156 killed. 1244 injured, and
9616 houses destroyed.
The number of deaths in the Aomori
prefecture is not known yet. In the
Miyagi prefecture the villaees of Shizu
kawa. Otani, Otatsa and Karakuwa suf
fered most from the wave. In Iwate pre
fecture. Kisen-Numa. Sakari, Kamaishi
and Kuji were most damaged. In Aomori
prefecture, Minatok, Hacbinohe and
Miyako were severely damaged.
A dispatch to the Yomiura from Morika.
dated June 20, states that over 60,000 peo
ple were either killed or injured by the
recent calamitous wave. Over 500 koku of
rice were sent from Hakodate to various
places for the survivors, who were on the
verge of starvation. In Kesen district of
Iwate one town and eleven villages were
destroyed, while 6000 persons perished and
1400 houses were swept away. In the
Minami Hei district three town? and eignt
villages were overwhelmed; 5627 persons
were drowned, 382 were injured and 1236
bouses were destroyed. A full investiga
tion will probably double these figures.
In Awomorie prefecture 300 persons per
ished, 143 were injured, 18 houses were
destroyed and 480 schools demolished.
Over 150 bodies were cast ashore on an
island five miles distant from Kamaishi.
Tbe following figures refer to the Kesen
district: Six thousand and nine dead, 313
injured, 3518 houses destroyed. TheNichi
Nichi states that the survivors of the re
cent disaster are subsisting on fish washed
ashore by the wave. They are compelled
to eat them raw, having no cooking ap-
purtenances. The ships Daisan Choan,
Maru, Kaijo, Myozin and Kompira, which
were in Kamaishi harbor on the night of
I Monday, were left by the wave, almost un
injured inland among the fields.
The visitation will probably be remem
bered as the most extensive of its kind
since 1854, when the provinces of Suruga,
Totomi. Mikawa, l^a, Ise, Settsu, Harna,
Awa, Sanuki, Iyo and Tosa were swept by
huge waves in November. The wave orig
inated not far from the Japanese coast,
probably in an extensive displacement of
the seabed on the southwestern edge of
Tuscarora Deep, and it appears to have
visited over 300 miles of coast line. Even
in Hokkaido it wrought destruction. The
most southerly limit of the ravages ap
pears to have been just a little north of the
famous arcnipelago of Matsushima. Had
the wave impinged upon the coast south
of Kinkasan it would have worked ruin
among the town and villages such as
Ishinomaki, Shiogama, Nobiru and oth
ers. But it missed the promontory and
began its devastation with the villages of
Onagawa and Okachi, situated across the
neck of the peninsula. Thence to the
northward its ravages may be traced by
reports that have come from Kesen-
Numa, Hamisho and other towns and
hamlets.
The country between Miyako and
Kesen-Numa has hilly peninsulas, a fiord
like coast, with mountain ridges leading
down to it. The harbors are stated to be
tbe finest in Japan. The fishing industry
is large. This is the region that has been
laid waste.
Japanese papers have many theories as
to the cau&e of the sudden ocean dis
turbance. Some suggested that a volcanic
eruption had taken place far out in the
Pacific. Another toeory is that a huge
cave-in occurred in the southern part of
tbe great deep, beginning off Ishinomaki
and stretching over 700 miles northward
and eastward.
A Hachinohe telegram states that many
bodies and wrecked houses were ashore in
the Kamikita district of the Komorito
prefecture, from which the conclusion is
drawn that the wave traveled southeast
and northwest. The Jiji says, referring
specially to the Motoyoshi district, that
though the bodies recovered were only
five or six hours in the water they looked
as if they had been tossed by the waves
for several weeks. The bodies were laid
in heaps, in many cases with nothing to
cover them. A telegram trom Kamaishi
states tnat only 2000 out of a population
of 6500 were saved at that place. Those
who escaped were more or less injured.
The medical assistance was insufficient.
The wave reached a height of eighty feet
in the Iwate prefecture.
Abbe H. J. K. Rispal, the French mis
sionary, saw those drowned at Kamaishi.
He stated that a great many Japanese
fishing-boats had been destroyed by the
wave. No damage to European vessels
has been reported. The Oshirohma and
Yoshima post and telegraph offices with
j their officers and families were swept
I away.

PACIFIC GROVE CHAUTAUQUA.
Seven Hundred People Present When the
First Day's Gathering ts Called
to Order.
PACIFIC GROVE. Cax., July B.â The
first session of the twelve-day Cbautauqua
Assembly began here to-day. About 700
people were present. Rev. Dr. McClish
presided and Rev. Dr. Filben, the superin
tendent of instruction, had the manage
ment of the programme..
The course of this year's assembly is a
most interesting one, and many of the
most prominent people in the State will
read papers on topics in which the Chau
tauquans are concerned.
One distinctive feature is the devoting
of certain days to certain subjects. Chau
tauqua day falls on a Sabbath, and a moot
interesting programme has been ar
ranged. Besides this there will be a
women's day; a field-day, when all indoor
work will be suspended; an American day,
recognition day and assembly Sunday.
To-day's programme was long and in
teresting, but devoted almost entireiv to
musical exercises. No papers were read,
as the idea has been to make the first day
one of pleasure, and thereby give mem
bers a chance to get the work before them
well in hand before they actually start in
on it. There were nineteen members on
this evening's programme, and it was
participated in by the California Male
Quartet and the Treble Clef Ladies' Quar
tet. The Misses Sherwood performed on
the mandolin and guitar, and Miss Ship
ley played several solob on the cornet, as
did Miss Stickney on the violin. Miss
Safford gave several interesting readings.

BAKERSFIELD, Cal., July B.â The
mystery of the death of Felix Anliker has
been explained. It appears that he and
his partner, while on their way to San
Luis Obispo, got on the wrong road, on
which no water was to be had for sixty
miles. After suffering from thirst Anliker
became ill, and his partner left him to go
in search of water ana assistance. After a
long searcn he met William Smith of
Antelope, who showed him where water
could be obtained. With a cask of water,
both men went back to where Anliker had
been left, but could not find him. He had
evidently gone in search of water on his
own account, taking a coffee-pot with him.
It 1b evident from subsequent discoveries
that Anliker wandered a long way from
the road, and finally died from thirst and
sickness on the spot where his body was
found.
LOS ANGELES QUARREL
Lively Tilt Between Members
of the Normal School
Board.
Funds Transferred to a Bank in
Which Trustee Wilson Is
a Stockholder.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July B.â The ad
journed meeting of the Normal School
trustees this afternoon was characterized
by lively tilts between Governor Budd's
newly appointed members, Wilson and
Brooks. The latter was appointed to fill
the vacancy caused by the death of Gen
eral Mansfield. Trustee Davidson was re
moved to make way for Wilson. Senator
Brooks, in a speech laden with severe in
vective, asserted that his opponent had
been appointed to a live man's position,
while he (Brooks) was tilling a place made
vacant by an unfortunate and untimely
death.
The controversy arose over a transfer of
Normal School funds at the instigation of
Trustee Wilson and others of the board
from the Farmers' and Merchants' Bank
to the Merchants' National, formerly the
Southern California National Bank.
Trustee Brooks, the "great economizer" of
the board, pleaded that he wanted this
large fund kept in banks that had never
closed their doors, even in the hours of the
wildest monetary panics. He said that
any hank with this record would be ac
ceptable to him.
The fund amounts to about $40,000.
Trustee Wilson owns some of the Mer
chants' National stock aud is one of its di
rectors. He was reminded of this during
the controversy thio alternoon. The vote
was four to one in favor of Wilson's bank.
TRAGEDY AT SAN JOAQUIN CITY.
George Finch Mistakes His Brother for a
Burglar and Shootsâ Dies in His
Slayer's Arms.
STOCKTON, Cal., July B.â A pitiful
tragedy â the unintentional slaving of a
man by bis brother â was enacted at San
Joaquin City shortly after midnight this
morning. George Finch, the proprietor of
the only hotel in the village, shot and
killed Alfred Finch, whom he mistook for a
prowler for whom both were searching.
The tragedy occurred in the hotel bar
room. George Finch had been aroused
from sleep by a noise made by some one
moving in front of the building. Believ
ing it was made by a robber he aroused
Alfred, telling the latter to get his pistol,
the only one about the place, and give it
to him. George then armed his brother
with a brass faucet and toid him to keep
behind him while he reconnoitered to see
if any one was without.
Instead of doing as he was told Alfred
slipped through the saloon door, which
was unlocked, to see if any one was hidden
within. George Finch did not know this,
and, hearing a noise in the saloon, de
manded to know who was there. Alfred
gave no answer. Seeing his form in the
darkness the elder brother fired, the bullet
talcing effect in Alfred's back below the
shoulder-blade. George then ran in to
grapple with the supposed robber, but
stopped aghast when the latter exclaimed:
"George, you've killed me." Alfred Pinch
expired In his brother's arms a few mo
ments later.
There is no telephone or telegraph com
munication from San Joaquin City, so C.
A. Dreyer drove to Banta and telephoned
to Sheriff Cunningham and Coroner Clark
about 2 o'clock this morning. Both started
for the scene of the killing at an early
hour this morning, and an inquest was
held at San Joaquin City over the body of
Alfred Finch. The brothers were on the
best of terms, and each highly esteemed
the other. The inquest proved this, and
that no blame could attach to the one who
did the shooting. He will not be arrested,
as the District Attorney is satisfied that
the killing was accidental.
Many years ago George Finch kept a
blacksmith-shop in this city, and he is
well known here and on the West Side.

ALCATRAZ PRISON
TO HOLD A BARON
Yon Adlesdorff, a Titled
Bavarian, Arrested for
Desertion.
FLED FROM ARMY LIFE.
Imprisoned After Repeated At
tempts to Quit Uncle
Sam's Service.
WANTED IN HIS NATIVE LAND.
He Had Engaged in Many Duels and
Once Murdered a D.fenseless
Adversary.
PORTLAND, Ob., July B.â A corporal's
guard passed through here last nijjht, en
route for the military prison on Alcatraz
island, San Francisco bay, having in
charge seven military prisoners from
Montana and Idaho posts.
Among these prisoners was August
Leibknecht, a German, 35 years old. He
has been in this country seven years only,
but in that time has deserted rive times
from the United States army in various
parts of the country. His latest desertion
is said to have been from Fort Benton,
Montana, about four months ago, but he
got no further than Helena before he was
recaptured.
There is a Dit of tragic romance at
tacned to Leibknecnt's career. His right
name is Baron Yon Adlesdorff and he be
longs to one of the minor noble families
of Bavaria. At the age of 22 years, after
completing his education, Yon Adlesdorff
was graduate ' in the Bavarian contingent
of the Prussian army as a junior officer.
He became a hard drinker, and tnat, cou
pled with an irascible disposition, led him
to engage in broils with his feflow-officers
and others of his social rank. Up to his
twenty-eighth year, it is reliably stated,
Yon Adlesdorff fought on an average of
two duels a year after the first year of his
service in the army.
His last escapade in that line, occurring
in 1889, was a disgraceful and cowardly
one, compelling him to flee from his na
tive land. The story goes that in the
early spring of that year he crossed swords
with a young officer on the outskirts of
Munich. The Baron's adversary fell, but
not fatally hurt. Yon Adlesdorff attacked
his prostrate foe, piercing the defenseless
soldier's breast witn his sword. It was a
miserable, cowardly act, but the Baron's
friends aided him to escape from the field
of honor before bis victim's adherents
could summarily avenge his death.
The Government offered a large reward
for the murderer's capture, dead or alive,
but he succeeded in eluding identification
until recently, when he was sentenced to
eight years' confinement in a military
prison for desertion from the United
States Army. At this crisis the so-called
Leibknecht, in his desperation, had the
foolish temerity to appeal to the Ger
man Consul-General in New York for in
tercession in his behalf. A superanuated
attache of the Consul's office remembered
Leibknecht's Bavarian crime, and the
faci of his being in the custody of the
American military authorities has been
communicated to Europe. In the mean
time LeibKnecht will spend his days in
prison.
FAST RACING AT NAPA.
Stam B Takes Toggles' Measure
and Lowers His Own
Record to 2:11 3-4.
Owyhee Easily Wins the 2:40 Class
Trot and Lady Tnornhill the
Special. 1
NAPA, Cal., July B.â This was chil
dren's day at the track, and the young
idea held full sway during the forenoon.
Pony, sack and running races for money
prizes proved a strong drawing card for
the youngsters of both sexes, and to the
successful contestants as much homage
was paid as was accorded the Greek hero
of tbe Marathon race.
In the afternoon the great 2:15 trot
attracted a big crowd expecting to see a
great contest between Stam B, the grand
four-year-old son of the majestic Stamboul,
owned by the Tuttle Brothers of Rocklin,
and Toggles, the crack son of the Fresno
sire, Strathway. There was no disappoint
ment, for it was the greatest race of the
meet.
After four heats had been trotted aud
t he dust of battle had cleared away victory
rested on the crown of Stam B and his
record is now 2:11-%, a reduction of 3%
seconds. Napa tracK was tbe scene last
year of the winner's great struggle with
the sensational Zombro, when he had
finally to acknowledge defeat, though not
until he had set t"he Pacific Coast mark for
three-year-olds in a race as well as the
coast stallion race record for horses of that
age. Just six years ago his renowned sire,
Stamboul, set the big crowd wild by trot
ting a mile in exactly the same note as his
son made to-day.
The day opened piping hot, but by the
time the first race was called the cooling
breeze put in its usual appearance to the
relief of all. The track was in splendid
shape and fast time was looked for. The
betting is still light and one would he con
strained to think that many of the wor
shipers of the light-harness horse must be
existing in a trance or under the influence
of a Svengali.
The opening race was for two-year-old
trotters and marked the second appear
ance of the Oakwood Park stock farm's
young giant, Owyhee. He brought $20
against $7 for tbe entire field. It was
simply no race at all, for the lavorite won
both the necessary heats as he liked, tbe
time being 2:33 in each. Lynall, who ex
hibited fine bursts of speed, divided second
money with Lottie Lilac.
When the six starters for the 2:15 trot
were called the betting strongly favored
Stam B, who sold for $20, Toggles $13 ana
the field $7. Tbe second choice was heavily
played to win the first heat, which he did,
the favorite fetching up a length further
back-, in 2:l2 U'.
There was but slight change in the bet
ting after this beat, Stam B still selling a
pronounced choice. Toggles led the fa
vorite to the homestretch, where Delaney
began making bis drive. In a desperately
fought-out contest Stam B passed the wire
a head in advance of the Fresno gelding
in 2:11%, the fastest time ever trotted
over the i\apa track in a race. As on the
occasion of his other defeat .by Stam 8.,
Driver Clark's horse-seemed to lose heart,
lor Stam;;: B experienced no difficulty in
placing the remaining two heats and the
race â¢to his â¢ credit ;in 2:17 i and 2:16, re
spectively. In the concluding heat Tog
gles finished last. .
The special event, best three in five
heats, brought out Lady Thornhill, Gil
patnek, Prince Ira and Millie S. Lady
Thornhill sold favorite in the pools at $10,
Prince Ira ; bringing $5 and the field $3.
The favorite won the opening heat, but
the time, 2:32^, was so slow that the
judges declared all bets on the heat off
and instructed the drivers to all "go" for
the next heat; or suffer expulsion. -The
Lady then took the }. second , ; heat rin \ 2:20.
She was beaten* out in a close finish by
Gilpatrick in the third heat, and then cap
tured the necessary two. It was a very
tame betting affair.

Colonel John S. Young mentioned for
the Major-Generalship.
Gossip in military circles has recently
been rife with suegestions in regard to
the probable successor to the late Major-
General W. H. Dimond. The latest name
to be mentioned in this connection is Colo
nel John S. Young, who has seen many
years' service in the National Guard, and
is known as an able officer.
Colonel Young was asked if he was an
aspirant for the place, and replied that he
had not made any effort to advance his
interests in that direction; nor did he feel
it proper or dignified for him to take any
such action. Some of his friends bad sug
gested the matter to him, but he had
not given it serious consideration.
General Thomas J. Clunie and General
Warfield are mentioned as probable ap
pointees. Colonel Walter Turnbull is also
on the list.
It is expected that Governor Budd will
not make the appointment for six months
or a year, following the course he has so
consistently followed in filling vacancies
since his inauguration.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL. i
PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION
and PROSPERITY.
FOB PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Obio
FOB TICr-PKKSI DENT-
GARRET A. HOBART, or New Jersey
EJECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
Chairman Daniel's speech was decidedly
a dull thud.
The people ask for work and Democracy
offers them wind.
Eastern Democrats may not bolt but
they are preparing to scatter.
It is becoming evident that when local
politics opens up it will open up big.
Senator Hill declares he doesn't feel sore,
but he admits his feelings were hurt.
Whitney continues to decline â not the
residency â but in public estimation.
If the goldbug free-traders bolt there
will be no place for them but England.
Daniel went to Chicago with a reputa
tion as an orator. He will leave it with a
valise.
If the Populists consent to fuse with any
such gang as that at Chicago they deserve
to be lost.
About this time Senator Teller begins to
wonder what he got off for and where he
got off at.
The Chicago convention has made things
look squally for Democracy, but the coun
try is all right.
There is one sign of improvement in
Democracy. It has repented of Cleveland
ism and repudiated it.
As the platform demands an income tax
we have another evidence that Democracy
never learns anything.
The turning down of Tarpey is another
victory for Daggett. The mint seems to be
working as a scalp factory.
Altgeld is a good boss so far as managing
men is concerned, but the work he gets out
of them is always a Dad job.
Before Monterey celebrates another semi
centennial she will be a bigger town and
have more room for visitors.
The free-trade rooster cannot crow for
free silver, and if Democracy, wanta a bird
this year she will have to take a goose.
When Cleveland raised the dust of the
money question to hide the tariff issue he
never dreamed that it would obscure him
also.
Mr. Cleveland may now have himself
depicted as the Ancient Mariner, "Alone,
alone â all, all alone; alone on the deep,
deep sea."
Compare the speech of Thnrston at St.
Louis with that of Daniel of Chicago and
see the difference between eloquence and
platitudes.
Over in the greenback-using East they
know about as much of the question of
standard coins as a goat knows of high
art in bill posters.
About this time the administration has
begun to feel very sorry that it ever put
the money question to the front to keep
people from talking of the fiasco tariff.
The Yale boys have the satisfaction of
knowing that while they did not win the
prize they pulled off an international boat
race without a Bquabble and they deserve
a medal for that
Gold money is good and silver money is
good, but without work a man can get
neither gold nor silver, and therefore the
people demand protection to American in
dustry as the first issue in the campaign.
Th<Â» Republican pledge to promote inter
national bimetallism is worth more to
intelligent advocates of free silver coinage
than all the Democrats or Populists could
promise though they talked from now till
doomsday.
All classes of farmers have felt the de
pression caused by the overthrow of the
protective system, and as a consequence
the Populist as well as the Democratic
party will see many of its members cast a
straight vote on election day for McKin-
Jey and protection.
There is a report that General Maceo not
only passed the Spanish trocha but en
tered Havana and took a leisurely stroll
a boat the streets; and while the story may
not be true the fact that it is current
shows what the Havana people think of
the situation and of the possibilities that
exist in it.
A correspondent of the New York â  Tri
bune says that frost 'is an increasing dan
ger to the orange industry of Florida, as
the records show the "frost line" is stead
ily moving - southward in - the State and
cold waves are 'â  becoming \ severer ' every
year. We may yet have to take on our
selves the task of supplying all the citrus
iiiiU needed ia Una country.
SILVER REPUBLICANS.
We have received from various parts of
'the State letters from silver Republicans
asking how they can support the St.
Louis ticket and platform without being
adverse to the great cause of bimetallism
and free silver. These letters attest in every
line the earnestness which marks the
character of the true patriot who desires
to vote right, and they are, therefore, de
serving the attention of the public gen
erally.
Those who are in doubt on this issue
have not read the St. Louis platform
clearly, nor do they understand existing
conditions rightly. The St. Louis platform
does not declare for the gold standard.
On the contrary, it pledges the party and
its candidate for the Presidency to pro
mote international bimetallism. This
declaration is certainly not adverse to the
movement toward the free coinage of
silver. As a matter of fact some ot the
most earnest advocates of silver have long
advocated just such a course, and all free
silver men can consistently support it as a
first step toward the accomplishment of
what they so much desire.
The issue becomes better understood,
however, when we consider it in relation
to the whole situation. A vote against
the St. Louis ticket and platform would be
a vote against not only bimetallism by in
ternational agreement but against the
protective tarin system and American in
dustry. It would be a vote against the
party of efficient government in favor of
the party of bungling and misgovern
nient. It would be to turn away from the
soldier candidate McKiuley and all that
his heroic record in war and peace repre
sents, to ally one's self with the crowd
ruled by the anarchist Altgeld of Chicago,
or the ignorant and sectional Tilman of
South Carolina.
If we turn from the Nation at large to
this State we shall see abundant reasons
why all intelligent and conservative busi
ness men and workingmen should remain
true to the Republican party and give an
earnest support to the St. Louis ticket
In California the silver question is not an
issue. All parties are pledged to it. Re
publicans, Democrats, Populists and Pro
hibitionists are agreed on that issue.
Every candidate for Congress from this
State, ho matter on what ticket he runs,
will be favorable to free coinage. The di
viding issues with us are those of protec
tion against free trade and of capable men
against incompetency and bungling. The
Democratic administration failed as much
from weak men as from bad measures.
The party could not act together on any
subject, and the result was a fiasco in
every branch of the Government and in
every administrative department.
The first issue before us is the restora
tion of prosperity, the revival of industry,
the employment of idle men and the re
establishment at Washington of a Govern
ment capable of dealing with great ques
tions in a statesmanlike way. When we
have provided work for the people, en
acted a tariff that will yield a revenue to
the Government, turned the balance of
trade in our favor and have at the Na
tional capital a body of able, resolute and
united men to manage the affairs of the
Republic, we will be in a position from
which we can go forward to bimetallism
without danger to our finances or disturb
ance to our industries, and it is to that
end therefore that all true bimetallists
should work during the campaign and
vote on election day.
ALTGELD'S PLATFORM.
Inasmuch as the majority of the dele
gates to the Democratic convention went
to Chicago for the express purpose of com
mitting the party to the free and unlim
ited coinage of silver without qualification
or safeguards of any kind it is no surprise
that the platform speaks upon that ques
tion with emphasis. But, on the other
hand, it is in the nature of a deli to all
the world and implies an independence of
the commercial world which our farmers
more especially do not want.
The Democracy would needlessly
antagonize our grain and provision pro
ducers in the markets where they sell
their surplus produce. Moreover, there is
an intimation that, as Mr. Boies pats it. as
between all silver and all gold as the
metal for redemption-money the first
named would be preferable. It will be seen
that although the platform declares for
the free coinage of both gold and silver it
does not necessarily mean bimetallism,
since in any event silver must be coined.
The difference between the Chicago and
St. Louis platforms on that question is
clear and distinct. The latter is for the
coinage of both metals in a way that their
parity as redemption money will be main
tained under any and all circumstances.
The Wilson-Gorman tariff act is prac
tically indorsed. Although the wording
of that plank is vague, yet when taken in
connection with the declaration on the
income-tax question, it is plain to be seen
that the idea is to add to the free list
and make up the deficit by swamping
the Supreme Court, so that a decision
favorable to the income tax theory of col
lecting revenue may be adopted, which
shall be the policy of the Government.
The only protection to American labor
provided for is such by immigration laws
as shall prohibit the landing in this
country of competing workingmen of
that kind, but meanwhile the gates
are to be opened wide to the importation
of goods and wares that are produced by
pauper labor in other couutriea. The
platform contains the usual Democratic
glittering but meaningless generalities,
and the document shows ibat its making
was in new and untried bands. It is just
such a declaration of principles as will re
quire continued explanation by the party.
In short, It is a piece of patchwork through
out.
NOW FOR THE POPULISTS.
Now for the Populist National Conren-
tion. It meet* July 22 at St. Louis, and
the attendance is likely to , be very, much
larger than at either the Republican or
Democratic gatherings. The hotels of St.
Louis do not expect to be overrun, but
keepers of boarding-houses are preparing
to reap a bountiful harvest.
The old leaders are in favor of the Omaha
platform, but some of the younger mem
bers want more practical politics and less
sentiment. The Omaha, declaration de
mands Government ownership of the rail
way and telegraph lines; the abolition of
the national bank system; the free coinage
of silver the resumption of the issuing of
greenbacks , the right of the citizen to bor
row money of the Government at a nom
inal rate of interest; "a : system of ; storage
warehouses where farmers may store their
grain until satisfactory prices are reached ;
postal savings banks, and i free trade in all â 
manufactured goods, but not in farm prod
ucts or raw material that is a product of
this country. â  v- -V '
y Mr. Taubeneck, who is the guiding spirit
of the Populist party, is of the opinion

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1896.
and it would be an abject surrender of all
the Populist party has labored for to in
dorse or in any way affiliate with the new
Democracy. For once the Populists will
show evidence of possessing some sound
political sense if they stick to that resolve.
DEMOCRACY'S PURPOSE.
The speech of Senator J. W. Daniel, tem
porary chairman of the convention, voiced
the new doctrine of the Democratic party.
There were other speakers, but their utter
ances were merely sound and fury, signi
fying nothing. The principles of the party
which had been proclaimed by fifteen pre
ceding National Conventions as containing
the sum total of the desire of the party's
heart were ruthlessly cast aside and Alt
geld't tale of woe substituted for them.
Mr. Daniel put it well when he said "the
party began with tee sunrise in Maine and
spread into a sunburst in Louisiana and
Texas." When the sun bursts there 1b
everlasting darkness, and there is where
the once grand and glorious Democratic
party lies weeping and wailing and gnash
ing its teeth. llow are the mighty fallen !
There was cunning in Altgeld's purpose
in selecting Virginia's great orator to pro
claim that upon coming to the parting of
the ways the Democracy had taken the
left-hand road. The occasion needed just
such glitteiing generalities and rhetorical
rubbish as Mr. Daniel could weave and
dig up to divert the mind and cover over
the dastardly work. But will there not be
"a Daniel come to judgment" by and by,
when the spirit of the Democracy of Jef
ferson and Jackson cries out for rescue
from Altgeld's whited tepulcher? The
principles laid down by the father of
America's Declaration of Independence,
and which were defended by the hero of
New Orlean?, rolled into a football by a
son of the mother of Presidents for an
archists to kick hither and yonl
It is not surprising that in sounding the
"keynote" of the campaign Mr. Daniel
.should lay all the troubles that have come
to humanity, including the fall of Adam,
at the door of the money question, but it
is surprising that a man of his character
should become such an abject slave of Alt
geld. Mr. Daniel stated to the convention
that the commercial failures, industrial in
activity, idle workmen and general de
pression in recent years all came as the
legitimate consequence of the so-called de
monetization of silver in 1573, but he
knows very well that the tone of business
operations of all kinds was generally
healthy and that the wage-earners hud
plenty of opportunity to employ their
skill and energy in all the years between
1873 and the substitution of Democratic
free trade for reasonable protection. He
knows very well that it is not the "silver
question" but the operation of the Wilson-
Gorman tariff act that has Kept the busi
ness interests of the country in the em
brace of disaster the past three years.
Mr. Daniel made no reference at all to
the operation of the tariff law which bis
party enacted, except to roundly abuse
the Supreme Federal Court for not decid
ing the income act constitutional in defi
ance of what the constitution distinctly
declares. He skimmed on the crest of the
Populist silver wave, and crowded his
speech full of bold and broad assertions,
but not one of his suggestions was fortified
with a logical reason. But then the new
leaders of his party are masters in the art
of deception, and in ratio to their ability
to mislead the people will they succeed in
laying hands upon the machinery of the
Government.
WOMEN BICYCLE RIDERS.
In Washington, D. C, there is a society
called "The Woman's Rescue League, 1 '
and just now it is making war upon the
bicycle as a means of rapid transit or
pleasure for women. The league pro
claims that "immorality is alarmingly on
the increase among; American women,"
and all because of the horrid bicycle. It
may be that the ladies of the Rescue
League are actuated by the loftiest and
most sincere motives, but for all that it is
unfortunate for themselves tliat they have
so little confidence in their sex. It may
be, too, that the rescuers are in a measure
right when they say that the bicycle pro
moted immorality, but a mere assertion
that it is so does not make it so.
Undoubtedly the bicycle tends to more
familiar association between men aud
women than some other ways of enjoying
companionship, but if the logic of these
rescuers is good to apply to bicycle riding
it is good to apply to buggy riding or
walking. It is the guilty mind that
suspicion most troubles. No doubt women
would be safer if they were kept in seclu
sion, and they would be safer still if they
were in their graves, but there would be
no thought of their safety if men were
fitted to coffins and the lids nailed down.
Now, a true woman does not compro
mise her modesty a whit more on the
bicycle than she does riding on a street
car or a buggy. All things are evil to the
evil-minded.
It so happens that a great many women
use the bicycle for convenience. They
have to go from place to place on legiti
mate business, and it ia quite as proper
to go on a bicycle as it is to walk. Then
very many women ride the bicycle for
health and others for pleasure, and if
there be anything; immoral in it it is dis
covered by others than those who ride
wheels. It ia very true that some women
bicycle riders adopt costumes that might
be spliced out a little with the same kind
of material, but the same is very much
more true of some men bicyclists. The
fact is, these are not the days of the May
flower, but there are just as many good
and true women now as there were in
those days. The members of the Rescue
League might better attend to rescuing
their own minds from the many unfounded
suspicions which appear to keep them in a
etate of agitation. *
DEMOCRATIC CIVIL SERVICE
Fresno Republican.
J. W. Anderson, who in now doing mission
ary work among the Federal office-holders of
Nevada in behalf of the Democratic campaign
fund, levies ass^smeius on the officials as fol
lows: $25 on $750 per annum situations, $30
on $1000 postmasters, soon to be in the civil
service, $/0 on $1000 appointments, $125 on
SlOOOand $300 on if 1000. He is said to be
doing a good business among the faithful, too.
As somebody has been heard to remark, (treat
is Democracy, with its civil service reform, and
greatly to be praised. Evidently, il the Demo
cratic host has no campaign fund in the ap
proaching campaign it will not be for lack of
"practical politics." What a gorgeous farce
talk of political reform sometimes is, to be
sure.

MUSICS &
MUSICIANS
HOW HISTORY IS MADE.â Don Chisciotte,
a Roman nevspaper, haa been amusing its
readers by publishing a criticism on the first
performance of Verdi's "Krnani/ which, it
says, was published in L' lllustration in 184 U.
The paper adds that on its first performance
the work was not entitled "Ernani," on ac
count of Victor Hugo's prohibition, but wan
produced under the title of "The Proscript."
"Since Verdi wrote his 'Nabucco,'" says the
critic of L'lllustration, "he has certainly made
progress. The composer's thought seems now
to be more clearly developed, the instrumenta
tion is less noisy, and more regard is shown for
human voice. Signor Verdi Is not yet prodigal
of melody, but he is less miserly of it than
before, and his style has more force, warmth
and dash. In the ensemble work he rises to
great power." The critic sums up his opinion
of the composer by saying: "This opera does
not put Verdi among composers of the first
rank, but he is a musician of merit who has
some brilliancy and eclat. Fortherest.be is
youne, and perhaps may do better. It will be
worth paying attention to what he goes on
producing. If he succeeds in acquiring more
power for writing melody and learns to vary
his effects, if he gets a little more sensibility
and passion, he may perhaps become one of ths
notable artists of his day."
The strangest thing is that "Ernani" was
first produced at Venice in 1844, under its
present title. Terhaps it was a pirated edition
of the wora that L'lllustration criticized two
years later.
The financial difficulties of Abbey, Schoeffel
<i Grau have been adjusted, and the firm
is now resuming business. This means that
New York is to have another opera season in
1896, and with Melba, the De Reszkes and the
rest of the great company of last year. The re-
Florence Gerard Abbey, Whose Husband Will Resume Business Without His
Wife's Assistance
[Reproduced from an engraving.]
habilltation of the firm has been brought
about with wonderful speed. Meeting with
overwhelming disaster they have made a
settlement in six weeks and are again on their
feet, so tosp'ak. Abbey was lying almost at
the point of death when the bankruptcy
occurred, yet he managed to gather strength
enough in a few weeks to face the situation
and make a great and determined fight to pave
the firm from utter financial annihilation.
He has his enemies; they are determined in
opposition and they think they have good
cause for their attitude. But, however that
may be, they cannot Dut admire the manner
in which be, ill and weakened, struggled to
his feet and put up a gallant fight to retrieve
his lost position.
Another fact that greatly embittered Abbey's
condition was the announcement made in the
depths of his disaster that his wife, Florence
Gerard Abbey, intended to leave him and re
turn to the stage. Various reasons have been
assigned for this step, but the real facts are
not definitely known. It will be nine years
next February since Florence Gerard left the
stage. Since that time the general public has
only known Her as a handsome woman smartly
gowned, who has figured as a striking feature
In boxes at the opera in the various cities her
husband has visited in his role of impresario.
She has been an important factor in the Abbey,
Schoeffel and Gran Company, however, on ac
count of her tact and skill in managing the
visiting artists, keeping peace between the con
tending elements and being absolutely neutral
in the midst of the jealousy of rival stars. Her
immediate friends say she has been a good
wife and a good mother to the children sbe
found in Abbey's household when she became
its mistress. Mrs. Abbey, who will be a great
loss to her husband's company, has no inten
tion of going on the lyric stage. She will prob
ably be seen in legitimate drama in New York
next season.
A large part of the credit for the satisfactory
position, in which the Abbey, Schoeffel <t Grau
firm now finds itself is due to Mr. Grau.
While Abbey was attending to the financial
part o: the affair Grau was abroad undertak
ing the delicate and diplomatic work of keep
ing the artists from making new contracts
while thÂ« settlement was being adjusted in
New York. What would it have profited the
firm had the creditors been appeased, only to
find that the superb company had been scat
tered? When Abbey cabled to Grau that the
creditors had practically unanimously con
sented to the reorganization of the firm Grau
cabled back that he held the company practi
cally intact, and that the artists were ready to
come when wanted. There was a Boston end
to the affair also, and on this Schoeffel was
busily and successfully engaged.
The little church of Arnstadt in Thuringia
still contains the organ on which John Sebas
tian Bach played early in the eighteenth cen
tury, tli at iÂ« to say from 1704 to 1707. This
instrument is considered to be one of the fin
est in Germany, which possesses so many re
markal>io organs, ana the souvenirs attaching
to it render it particularly interesting. Un
fortunately it was restored for the first time
.about tweutjr years ago, and UiÂ« work wM
done so badly that a complete rehabilitation
has now become necessary. A committee has
been formed at Arnstadt to raise the lunds
necessary for this important restoration, and
the town is preparing a grand Bach festival,
which it is expected will attract devotees of
the great John Sebastian from all parts of Ger
many. All the proceeds to the festival will be
devoted to the restoration of the historic or
gan.
It is in France particularly that the female
composer is being honored and feted, probably
because France adores art and the female
composer there is doing her work well. Rouen,
the town of Joan of Arc, has been holding a
grand exposition and instead of letting the
composers of the sterner sex monopolize the
musical part of the affair it was resolved that
the exposition's special musical attraction
should consist of an Augusta Holmes festival.
A number cf this gifted Irish-French compos
er's works were performed, including her patri
otic "Ludis pro Patria" and her "Ireland." The
hall was filled to overflowing and ovations
were lavished upon the music, which was
rendered by a grand orchestra end chorus
and by soloists from the Grand Opera-house
of Paris.
After the terrible chandelier accident at the
Opera Comiqup it was resolved to adopt a
more modern system of lignting the house
and Gailhard, the manager, is now in London
examining the mode of lighting employed at
tne Empire and the Savoy. These theaters
are inainly illuminated by incandescent elec-
trie lights in tne ceiling and I
glass which incloses them is said to be attached
so securely to counter weights slung over the
beams within the roof that there is no danger
of its falling. If M. Gailhard could invesii-
gate the mode of lighting adopted in most of
the San Francisco theaters he would learn of
something safer still.
Budapest has Deen giving a grand na
tional exposition, and the students of the
town, resolving to celebrate Hungary's thou
sandth birthday by lifting up their voices in
song, banded themselves into a chorus 1400
strong and gave a monster concert in the vast
gallery of the exposition. The students had
been well trained, and the effect produced by
their young, fresh and sonorous voices is said
to have been superb. It would add a good
deal to the effect of grand celebrations of
Native Sons if something of the sort could be
accomplished here.
Mme. Ambrolse Thomas has been so ill since
her husband's death that she has not been
able to move from the apartments at the Con
servatory of Music in Paris, which belong to
the directorate of that iustitution. Theodore
Dubois, the new director, gallantly placed the
rooms at her disposition as long as she wanted
them, but as Mme. Thomas is now a little
better in health she has announced her inten
tion of moving to a flat in the Champs Elysees.
Saint-Sacns had one jubilee performance
and liked it so well that now he has had a sec
ond. It was of a more private character than
the first affair and took place at the home of
Mr. Gigout in Paris. Gigout boasts that he
learned to improvise from attending the
church of the Madeleine when Baint-Saena
played the organ there.
It is announced that Siegfried Wagner, the
"Heir to the Name," will be one of the con

BOARD WANTS EVIDENCE
The Rub Will Come on the Event
of the Companies'
Refusal.
DR. STANTON'S RESOLUTION.
It Indorses a Schedule of Rates
Adopted by the Southern
Pacific
Yesterday afternoon the Board of Rail
road Commissioners in regular session
took tbe initial step in determining
whether or not it has jurisdiction over the
street railway companies to such an extent
tnat it may compel the companies to re
duce their present rates of passenger
transportation. Hitherto the action of
the board in this matter has been charac
terized by extreme caution and slowness
of movement. Yesterday it was resolved
to make an investigation of the books of
the companies as a preliminary move.
In the event of the companies refusing to
appear before the board with this informa
tion the case will be carried on a writ of
mandate to the Supreme Court, where a
decision may be expected within three
months.
Another highly important matter, the
approving of tlic present schedule of grain
rates on the Southern Pacific Railroad, in
troduced by Commissioner Stanton, was
briefly discussed, but on motion of Com
missioner I,a Rne, who feared inviting
contempt of court by coming into conflict
with Judge McKenna's injunction should
such an adoption be made, the question
was laid on the table for further considera
tion.
The board listened to the protest of An
drew J. Clunie aeainst the Southern Pa
cific's charge of 5 cents on the creek route
while on the regular ferry line the charge
was 10 cents. He said that this was a vio
lation of the law, and it was the tint* of
tbe boaid to insist on the company's
charging uniform rates on the ferry lines.
With regard to reducing the fares La
Rue said thai he did not think that there
could be any contempt of court in investi
gating the profits and expenditures of the
company, but he did believe such would
be the case if the board snould publish a
schedule of passenger rate-.
"If this di?criminaiion exists," said Mr.
Clunie, "it c<m be regulated without our
interfering with Judge McKenna's injunc
tion in any way."
Stanton was m favor of hearins evidence
on the matter, and suggested that a day
be set aside for this purpose.
Clunie said that the company had raised
the rate 5 cenis without notifying the
board of its intention, and that t/ua was a
violation of the State constitution.
La Rue and Clarke believed that action
on the matter should be postponed until
the injunction of Judge McKenna should
be dissolved. A vote~to postpone action
was carried.
Letters were rend from the different City
and County railway companies, in which
they denied that the Railroad Commis
sioners had any jurisdiction over them in
this reeard.
A letter was also read from Attorney-
General Fitzeerald stating that he was not
prepared to give an opinion as to whether
the board had a right to publish and main
tain a schedule of rates: that he would pre
fer to await the issue of the injunction
case, but that he would prepare subpenas
requiring the presence of the railway offi
cials before the board.
"I told *you at the time you requested
the Attorney-Genera! for this information,"
said Mr. Clunie, "that it was too close a
question for him to answer yet. If you go
ahead and get a test case "on a subpena
you wiil never get any closer to it. You
wiil never get at the merits of the case by
these mean:?.
. "If our information is correct the rail
way- have been charging exorbitant rate?
for the past three months. I want to say
to you that I have evidence from the books
of the railroad men tbemselves which will
enlighten you on this matter. If there is
a question of doubt it should be thoroughly
decided. The Attorney-General himself is
in doubt; he wants the matter decided by
the courts. If you are satisfied sfter in
vestigation that tne rates are too high and
decide to lower them, on their refusing to
do so you can carry the case to the Su
preme Court and net a decision there
within three months.
"This board." continued Mr. Clunie,
"has more power than any tribunal in the
State. Give the public the benefit of the
doubt in this matter at issue and take the
first step."
"They say," said Mr. La Rue, "that
street railway lines are not railroads."
It wcuid be no small matter to investi
gate this thing," said Mr. Clarke. "It will
require time and money."
â¢It will take no longer than ten days,"
said Mr. Clunie.
On motion of Dr. Stanton it was re
solved that the secretary be instructed to
prepare subpenas under the direction of
the Attorney-General to serve on the
officials of the Market- street Railway Com
pany, that the officials may bring such in
formation to tha board as it may require.
It was further resolved that the case
should come up for hearing at the next
meeting, August 5L /
This information will consist of such
items as bonded indebtedness, capital
stock, operating expensos. interest, tax
account, miles of road. etc.
"Could we proceed with the case
though," asked Or. Stanton, "should the
official- refuse to come?"
Mr. Clarke said that if they do refute
their refusal will constitute a test case.
On motion of Mr. Clarke Mr. Clunie was
requested to file a formal complaint with
tbe board against the present rates.
A letter was received from the Board of
Railroad Commissioners of lowa asking
the board's opinion as to whether ex
press rates are controllable by the Board
of Commissioners. The secretary was in
structed to write that in the opinion of
the board rates of express companies,
being rates of transportation companies
that work in with the railroad to the
detriment of slippers, are subject to ihe
control of the Hoard of Railroad Com
missioners.
A schedule of rates on grain and grain
bags sent by tbe Valley Railroad being in
consonance with the present system was
adopted.
Dr. Stanton submitted the following res
olution:
Whereas, This Boarc of Railroad Commis
sioners did on the 17th day of September.
1895, adopt and publish a schedule of
rates for the transportation of grain over ihe
lines of the Southern Pacific Company, and in
accordance with the law defining the powers
and duties of this commission served upon the
officers of said company copies of said grain
tariff, and ordered adopted by this board rela
tive thereto, and thAtsabarquent to this action
by this boani the Southern Pacific Company,
upon the representation that said rates were
unjust and unreasonable to that corporation,
made application to and secured from the
United States Circuit Court a temporary re
straining order, enjoining this commission
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1896.
from reducing any of the rates ot said com
pany; and, whereas, the Southern Pacific Com
pany has at various times since the adoption
and publication of a grain tariff of that com
pany by which grain rates have been reduced
to amounts equal and in some instances ex
ceeding the percentage of reductions made by
this board; therefore
Saolved, That the following schedule of
rates be and are hereDy approved as the official
rates of the Railroad' Commissioners for the
transportation ot grain over the lines of the
Southern Pacific Company from and to sta
tions named therein, and it being the judg
ment of this board that the rates so approved
having been voluntarily reduced by the South
ern Pacific Company for the purpose of com
peting with another common carrier, it is
ordered that snch reduced rates shall not be
again raised or increased without the consent
of this Board of Railroad Commissioners.
To tnese resolutions were appended a
schedule of rates adopted by the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company.'
A complaint was read from San Diego
saying that the Sonthern Pacific had
abandoned that part of the road near
Teniecula. The railroad states that the
line was abandoned for reasons it deemed
reasonable and proper. The board will
leave for San Diego Saturday to investi
gate this matter.
FOR THE CONVENTION.
A Little Extra tffort To-Dsy Would

HER SISTERS BONDS.
Lillian Ashley Could Not Secure Them
TeÂ«terdmy.
Miss Lillian Ashley was busily occupied
yesterday in trying to secure bail for her
sister Emma. Pastor W. L. Birch as -is ted
her and applied to E. J. Baldwin, who em
phatically refused to become one of
Emma's bondsmen.
"The truth is," said Baldwin, "both of
these women (Liilian and Emma) are ad
venturesses, and I feel that I must pro
tect myself, as well as other men, from
being b'.a.-kmaile 1.
"I believe that Lillian joined the Cal
vary Presbyterian Church merely for
effect, and that the shooting at me in the
courtroom was deliberate and premedi
tated."
Miss Lillian Ashley says that it is her
desire to remain in San Francisco, and
that she thinks she will resume the mani
cure business. She is very anxious to get
her sister Emma out of jail and to secure
some employment for her brother.
Although Lillian applied to several gen
tlemen yesterday, she was not successful
in securing bondsmen for her sister. It is
expected that the amount of the bond,
which is now $5000, will be reduced by
Judge Slack.
STOCKHOLDERS MUST PAY.
Judgment Against the Anburndmle
Fruit, Raisin and Nut Company.
Judge Murphy yesterday gave E. C.
Clowes judgment against the stockholders
o: the Auburndale Fruit, Raisin and Nut
Company for 30 per cent of $2525 36.
Clowes in 1594 obtained judgment against
the corporation for that amount, but it
was ne7er satisfied. Hence he brought
suit apainst the individual stockholders.
As the stockholders had only paid in 30
per cent of tne capital stock of the corpo
ration they were only liabie for that per
centage of the judgment.
His Honor also allowed Clowes interest
on the claim at 7 per cent.
WORK FOR THE CARNIVAL
Arranging the Programme
for the Great
Event
A Big Musical FestivalâEncourage
ment 1 rom the Far
South.
All arrangements for the big mass
meeting to be held this afternoon at 2:30
o'clock at the Chamber of Commerce have
been completed.
No set programme has been arranged
for the meeting. It was at first intended
to invite prominent speakers there, but
the executive committee deems it more
; advisable to allow those who attend to ex
j press their own views upon the subject.
The committee will state exactly what it
requires in the way of money to make the
thing a success, and what programme
they intend to present.
During the Monterey celebration General
Warneld made close observation as to the
amount of money expended in Monterey
immediately preceding and during the
I celebration. It Is estimated that the town
I gained not less than $300,000 in outside
money during the days of the celebration.
Oscar Boldemann of the executive com
mittee, who has been in San Diego during
the past week, has written to headquar
ters, stating that San Diego is with us on
the carnival proposition. The miiitia are
looking forward to visiting San Francisco
in carnival week, with their renowned City
Guard band, which is said to be one of the
finest in Southern California. The steam
ship company has been seen by the repre
sentatives of the militia company, and has
j agreed to make a very low rate both com-
I me and going.
William Greer Harrison of the Cali
fornia Music Festival Association has ad
dressed a communication to the executive
committee suggesting a grand popular
i concert at the Mechanics' Pavilion during
| the week of the carnival. He suggests
i that it would contribute greatly to the en
j tertainment of the people then gathered
i in San Francisco, and tne association sug
j gests that a chorus of about 1000 voices
| and an orchestra of about 100 instru
. ment&lists will be quite compatible with
! the present arrangements, with James L.
: Howe as conductor. To assist in the fes
: tival there will be a gathering of some of
| the best voices in the State to compete in
! contests which the Festival Association is
: arranging for. It is considered that this
| will insure not only a large but a very ef
! fective chorus. SoLsts of National reputa
tion will also be engaged.
The executive committee will meet to
night in the parlors of the California Ho
tel" to arrange a programme for the auction
sale of seats at the Columbia Theater on
Tuesday afternoon, July 14. Bonre very

Sausalito is gradually growing in im

Kinley is firmly seated in the Presidential
cnair the intention of tbe authorities is to
Ihe American Ship Snow and Burgess, the First Vessel Which Has Ever Un

have it made a port of entry and thus be
on an equal footing with Oakland. At the
present time the largest fleet of American
and foreign ships ever tied up in the har
bor is at inchor in Richardson's Bay. Fre
quently British ships have discharged part
of their cargoes at the narrow-gauge
wharf, but it remained for an American
ship to be the first to dock fully loaded
ana discharge her cargo into the coal
bunkers.
The Snow & Burgess arrived here from
Sydney, N. S. W., a couple of weeks ajio,
and was at once towed to Sausalito. She
has a cargo of coal for the railroad com
pany and it is being gradually unloaded.
In a few days she will be empty. She will
go to Puget Sound in ballast to load lum
ber for Port Piri. Bhe is a very handsome
craft and was well known for years in the
New York and San Francisco trade.
The nn fortunate Blairmore is in trouble
again. Another attempt to raise her was
made yesterday, but it failed. Tne weigiit
placed on her bilge raised her a certain
distance, and then everything gave way
again and once more her masts rolled into
the mud. "Try, try, try again" is Captain
Burns' motto, and as toon as things can
be got into position again another attempt
will be made.
Guests from the Bald win- Hobart wedding
who went to Oakland after the ceremony
in the launch Amy had a rongh time of it.
Among the party were John Drew and
Miss Barrymore, the Messrs. and Misses
Tobin and several others. They wanted
to reach Oakland in time for the actors to
play at Macdooough's Theater, but, owing
to a bead wind and a heavy sea, they came
near to being late. The Amy pitched into
it, and several times she had' to be slowed
down in order to prevent the sea from
breaking over. Cantain Peterson knew
I his boat well, however, and landed tne
party, safe and sound, at Broadway wharf,
Oakland, et 7:15 p. m., thus giving Mr.
I Drew and Miss Barrymore three-quarters
of an hour to reach the theater and dress
for the performance.
The launch Hueneme was stolen from
her moorings at Tiburon last Tuesday
nieht and t.iere is now a hue and cry
after her along the front. Her owner was
at all the tugboat offices and reported the
matter to the Harbor Police. No trace of
the boat can be found, end Captain Dun
ieavy thinks that her disappearance will
prove to be as mysterious as that of the
Goat Island launch Periwinkle.
Once more the State tug Governor Irwin
is undergoing repairs. About a year a_o
new boiiers were put in, but the job was a
failure and everything has now again to
be renewed. Yesterday new engines and
boilers were b ing put in, and when the
work is completed the vessel is expected to
be as good as new.
The monitor Monadnock and the cruiser
Philadelphia both returned from Monte
rey yester lay. The Monadnock crept in
through the fog early in the morning an<i
no one saw her until she was off Lonfbard
street wharf. The cruiser took no chances
and remained outside until the fog lifted.
Crews from both vessels will take part in
the celebration in Portsmouth square to
day. A detail of sixteen Naval battalion
men from the Comancbe will tire the
salute.
The Comancbe is to be officially in
spected durinp the week. About twenty
tons of coai were put into her bunkers yes
terday, and s earn will be got on the boil
ers to-day. Probably on Saturday Cap
tain Sumner of the MonadnocK will go
all over the vessel, and the turrets will be
worked. After the inspection the mon
itor may be taken on a cruise around the
bay.
The steamer Monticello broke down on
her way from Vallejo yesterday. The
Vigilant took her place on the morning
ana evening runs, but everything will be
in good working order again to-day. After
Sunday next the Monticello will run reg
ularly'to and from Vallejo, leaving here
each Sunday morning at 10:30 and Vallejo
at 4 p. m., thus giving passengers a three
hours' stop at Mare Island.
By steamer to Alviso and thence by rail
through Santa Clara Valley is an assured
fact. The railroad company has secured
the right of way over the entire distance,
the rails are at Alviso and the piles for tbe
new wharf are at Vallejo, whence they
will be rafted to their destination. The
only tiling slopping the enterprise at tbe
present time is the Southern Pacific. It
has blocked the scheme at tbe Alviso
crossing, and an injunction suit is now
pending. In order to eet the octopus to
relent the Board of Trade of San Jose has
sent a delegation to San Francisco to in
terview General Manager Fillmore on the
subject, but the chances are that they will
not succeed, as the Southern Pacific is not
encouraging opposition.
FIRE DEPARTMENT.
Fines Imposed and Several Appoint*
menti Made.
The Fire Commissioners, in view of the
celebration to-day, held a special meeting
yesterday afternoon. John Devine, stoker
of engine 19, was lined three days' pay for
sleeping during his floor watch ou the

BANKS MAKE PROTESTS.
Assessor Siebe's Figures Are
Distasteful to the Cor
porations.
County Equal z-rs Asked to Make
Redactions Amounting to
Millions.
The assembly-room of the Board of Su
pervisors presented a busy scene all day
yesterday when several him i red tax-pay
ers called to pore over the books of the
Assessor and gather figures on which to
base protests to the County Board of
Equalization. Ail about ttie room huge
volumes were spread out, and a force of
clerks was busy taking off figures for the
future use of the Assessor and for publica
tion in the municipal reports.
The Supervisors did not meet as equal
izers, but a number of protests that
will be considered in the near future were
received.
The London and San Francisco Bank
and the bank of British Columbia objected
to their assessments on the ground that
the Assessor bad acted arbitrarily and that
his action in including among their sol
vent credits debts that are unsecured by
trust-deed mortgage or lien is illegal.
The foraier institution represents that
its solvent credits were assessed at $999,
--298, but that there should bave bee.i de
ducted 188,765, that being the total amount
of unsecured debt". Moreover, the bank
is assessed for $164,576 due from J. P.
Morgan & Co. of New York. The peti
tioner contends that this credit has no ex
istence in this State and should not be
taxed here. Amonj the items in the sol
vent credits on the Assessor's books is the
sum of $385,853 which appears on Â»he
books of the corporation as due from the
branch oflice. The petitioner declares that
this is "only a bookkeeping contrivance
whereby the bank is made neither richer
nor poorer."
Another item is the sum of $116,774, due
from the Portland branch office, and $428,
--539 due from the Tacoma branch office.
These items are characterized in the peti
tion as "bookkoeping devices for the con
venient transaction of business." The
total amount alleged *o be improperly as
sessed against the bank as solvent
credits is $1,107,360. The petitioner fur
ther asks that the sum of $10,000, being
the assessed valuation of the franchise, be
stpcken off the boots, because the only
franchise the bank has was obtained under
tne laws of Great Britain. According to
the petitioner's estimate the total a.<<e-s
--ment should be reduced from $1,196,125 to
$78,765.
In the case of the Bank of British Co
lumbia the statÂ»iiÂ»c-nt is made in the pro
test that the assessment should be reduced
ffom $2,155,250 to $459,063.
The claim is made that all unsecured
debts, as well as $235,000 belonging to
numerous agencies, should be deducted.

MISSION FLATS

Sides About the South
ern Hills.
BIG CONTRACTS LET.
The Potrero Land and Develop
ment Company Sets the
Pace.
OTHERS ALSO FALL IN LINE.
Workingmen Protecting Themselves
From Mr. Vinlng's
Greed.
The busiest section of San Francisco as
regards street improvements is that known
as the Potrero or Southern Heights.
Since the Potrero Land Improvement
Company started in to cut down Blue
Rock Hill on the "Western side of Ken
tucky street some three years ago the in
centive has been recognized by other prop
erty-owners, and to-day hiUs and mounds
are being removed and gulches and hol
lows are being brought to grade surface.
This improvement company is still at
work cutting down Tennessee. Minnesota
and Indiana streets and the property ad
joining thereto. There is sufficient work
in sight for this company's men, teams
and rolling-stock for tne next three years.
But when the work is finished tbe oldest
inhabitant of the Potrero wouid not recog
nize the place, so great will be the trans
formation effected on the old. bald hills
that frowned down on Mission Bay.
Further back on tbe western slope Con
tractor John Kelso has an army of men
grading Alameda street, from Potrero ave
nue to Fifteenth street eastwardly. To do
this work there is a big cat through the
hill required.
.Fifteenth street, from Nebraska to Bry
ant avenue, a distance ot hve blocks, is
being put in shape to be graded. A
little further off, on Hampshire street, be
tween Fi.teenth and Sixteenth, the same
contractor has another pang at work get
ting that place in presentable condition for
building purposes.
To do ail this there will have to be over
30.000 cubic ysrus of earth removed, which
will be dumpe<i into Mission Bay, or, more
correctly speaking, Mission mud flat.
Another progressive association which
has done much to bring South San Fran
cisco and the Potrero country into habit
able condition is the Real E-tate and De
velopment Company, which has continu
ously kept an army of men and horses at
work for the pa^t three years.
Tnis company has just finished grad
ing the block bounded by Missouri, Con
necticut, Eighteenth and Nineteenth
streets, and has moved its plant one block
further, between Missouri and Eighteenth
streets, where the cutting will be used to
fill in the hollow and bring Mariposa
street, from Pennsylvania to Indiana, a
distance of three blocks, up to grade.
Twenty-tifth street is being graded,
curbed, sewered and macadamized from
Nebraska to Kansas street by Warren &
Malley.
Much of the dirt taken from the cut
operate I by the Potrero Land Improve
ment Company is b ins: used by the
Arctic O:i Works, which company is fill
ing in the block recently purchased along
side of its present stores. When this fill
ing is done a substantial brick building
will be erected thereon for tank and stor
age purposes.
The Union Iron Works has the first
story of its new building above ground,
and will have it finished and occupied be
iore the winter sets in.
The construction of this building and
the converting of the old office into a
boiler-shop will necessitate some changes
in the railroad track and switches leading
into the company's yards.
On some of the newly made ground, as
also upon the graded streets, several neat
residence buildings are being erected for
those workingmen who have families, and
who have suffered so much perturbation
at the hands of Mr. Vmm? in his Eastern
methods of running streetcars. So nig
gardly has been the system ot transfers to
or from the residence portions of the City
and the Potrero that many have made up
their minds to build their own little
homes near to their work, where tbey wi.l
not be compelled to pay 20 cents % day for
1 the privilege of seeing their little "ones
I when their day's work is over.

NO CHEATING AT CARDS
Judge Campbell I>i-mif>seÂ« the Caae
Against Saloon-Keeper Cawley.
William Cawley, saloon-keeper on Polk
and Me A lister streets, who was arrested
on Monday on tbe charge of robbery, had
his case dismissed by Judge Campbell yes
terday morning.
The charge grew out of a pofcer game m
Cawley'3 saloon. Cawley, If. Kinney. the
complaining witness, an -i H. Sanford were
playing Sunday nigh: when Cawley found
that Kir.ney was cheating nim by having
part of the deck of carJs on his knee. He
promptly pulled out his revolver and took
possession of th-i money he had lost.
The Judge in discussing the case said:
"If a footpad takes your ntor.ey fr^m you
at the point of a pistol, and you present a
pistol at him and take it back from him,
you couldn't be charged with robbery. So
if a man cheats you at cards and yoa take
back your money from him I don't con
sider that is robberyâ at least I feel sure
no jury would convict. But I want it un
derstood that no man has a right to pull a
revolver upon another man, even if he
rinds him cheating at cards."

"A DISGRACE TO
OUR CIVILIZATION."
Judge Campbell's Comments
on the Lack of Usury
Laws.
MRS. E. P. FERRY'S CASE.
She Was Charged Interest at the
Rate of 3 Per Cent
Per Month.
USURERS ARE BADLY SCORED.
lac Complainant Repeats the Story of
the Raid Made Upon Her Fur
niture and Eff:cts.
The search-warrant case of Mrs. E. P.
Ferry, 1107 Bush street, against John W.
F inn, auctioneer, 321 Gutter street, came
on for hearing before Judge Campbell
yesterday afternoon. Mrs. Ferry was rep
resented by Attorney McGowan and Fiinn
by Attorney Countryman.
Mrs. Ferry detailed the raid made by
Flinn and six or eight of his men last
Thursday afternoon upon her furniture
and other effects, as already published.
The document by which Fiinn claimed
the right to denude the house of ail its
chattels and throw them into the street
was put in evidence. It was an ironclad
note and agreement by Mrs. Ferry to S.
Jacobson, dated April 16, 1?96, promising
to repay the $1000 borrowed within six
months, she to pay interest at the rate of
S per cent per month, compounded, and if
at any time the interest should be over
ton had the right to seize the
furniture by force without any other pro
cess of law.
When the Judge read the document he
was wiid with indignation, and spoke his
mind freely and forcibly.
"This is* an abominable outrage," he
said, "upon an unsuspecting woman. It's
-.tee to civilnation that in this State
we have no usury laws lite other States.
No man should be permitted by law to
charge more than 8 percent interest, and
the sooner we have a law passed to that
effect the better.
"For a temporary loan of $1000 upon
furniture -aid to be worth six times the
amount this lady is charged the mon
strous sum ol $36 per month. It's a shame
and disgrace to our boasted civilization,
and such men as Asa FUke and others
who charge these exorbitant rates should
be driven out oor. r the town. They are al
most as bad as Shylock. Three per cent
per montti compound interest! Why, its
monstrous!
â¢And then if the interest should be a day
overdue this unfortunate woman's furni
ture can be seized, thrown into the street,
1-laced in some second-hand store and sac
linced for what it will bring:. It's not
right and it must be remedied.'
Mrs. i'erry testified that she had offered
to pay Flinn the interest several times,
but he had refused to take it as he insisted
upon having the principal and nothing
Attorney Countryman raised an objec
tion tfca; the complaint was defective in
asmuch as tbe law provides that in a
swell warrant there must be a deposition
as well as an affidavit by the complainant.
In this case there was no deposition.
Tne Jud?:e, after argument, said he
decision on the point this
afternoon, and ii weii taken Mrs. Ferry
could procure another search warrant and
inar.e her deposition.
Attorney Countryman wanted to cross
examine Mrs. Ferry, Claiming that from
her own mouth he would show that Fiinn
acted within bis rights, but the Judge
would not permit him in view of his od
jection to the warrant.
A BAY AT THE EMPORIUM
Shopper* Find Comfort and Attractive
Bargains at Their Clearing
Sale.
Comfort ;n shopping is something to be |
desired and it ia evident that the ladies of !
ttis City have found that the spacious !
Emporium is an ideal place in this parti- I
cular. Be- this feature is least of the
store's attractions just now, for they have
just inaugurated their first summer clear
ing sale. The extensive number of de
partments and the consequent great va
riety of goods to be obtained at this great
store makes it now more than ever the
Mecca of iadies on their shopping expedi
tions.
This is the first dealing sale of the house
since its opening, and tne management
state that v is their intention to make the
occasion one long to be remembered. At
the prices they have been asking they say
they nave been giving extra values, but
now. at this sale, everytning is maried
down so low that all who are fortunate
enough to take aovanwee of it will obtain
bargains rarely found either in this City
or elsewhere. Mr. Harper, the manager
of the Emporium, yesterday, whiie show
ing a Call representative through the
mammoth establishment, called attention
to a few of the articles being offered, as
weli as the prices being asked for same,
and said that the few illustrations cited
were samples of the cuts made in every
Jihe and every department. He showed
some dress eoods as iow as 15 cents per
yard, fancy checked taffeta silks at 25 cents
j-er yard, beautiful sheer Scotch dimities
at 8 cents per yard and novel lappet lace
dimities, which, he said, were among the
highest novelties of the season, at 15 cents
per yard.
For the ladies ready to wear depart
ments Mr. Harper called special attention
to genuine imported gowns of the finest
aimity. made in Paris by a famous dress
maker, and which they are selling at from
$:i5 each up. Paris millinery in abundance
is being offered for a mere song while
fcilk-lmed ladies' jackets at $8 90 and all
wool capes at 98 cents each are amon: the
other wonderful values seen at this sale.
One item in the clothing department, viz. :
Suits for boys from Bto 14 years old at;
$2 65, is a sample of the great reductions
mad* there. A leading feature in the fur
niture and carpet department is the pres- i
ent sale of the best body Brussels carpet
at vSO cents per yard, it would require col
umns to give extended mention of the
many bargains to be obtained at the Em
porium during this great clearing sale,
but the few just mentioned will suffice to
give a slight idea of the earnestness of the
Management to make this -ale one long
to be rememberd because of the wonder
iul values that are and will be offered.

Muddle.
As the result of a conference held.last Sun

of Health sent the following telegram to
the Secretary of the Treasury at Washing
ton, D. C, yesterday :
Dear Sir: For the better enforcement at the

laws require that the local quarantine officer
shall first board all vessels subject to inspec
tion, the Board of Health of this City, desiring
to co-operate with the Federal authorities in
this bebalf. suggests that the local quaran
tine officer shau first board such vessels, and
thereafter the proper msoection of such ves
sels shall be made conjointly by the Federal
officer detailed for that purpose and the local
quarantine officer. Dr. John F. Morse,
Ittt. G. J. Fttsgisbon,
Dr. Hekby H. Hart,
Dr. J. M. Williamson.
Though no reply has been received by
the board the members express confidence
that the Federal authorities will set the

IMPRESSIONS OF AN ENTHUSIASTIC ARTIST.
CANNOT DELIVER LETTERS
Local Firms Prohibited From
Competing With Uncle
Sam's Carriers.
This Action Will Swell Considerably
the Revenue of the Local
Postoffice.
Inspector in Charge Manro is fn receipt
of a ruling from the Postmaster-General,
which will swell considerably the revenue
of the local Postoffice, and incidentally
shorten the income of several enterprising
firms.
The particular case in question, how
ever, is the application of the Merchants'
Special Bill Delivery Company, 2107 Mason
street, to operate a general delivery sys
tem on a cheap scale in San Francisco and
adjacent towns. It was proposed to have
a central office, guaranteeing patrons at
least ore delivery each day. Particular
attention was to have been paid to monthly
bills, receipts and notices of all kinds. For
this service a 50 per cent redaction was
guaranteed. In other words the Mer
chants' Special Bill Delivery Company
would charge only 1 cent as against the
Government's 2 cents. To boost the scheme
it was pointed out that some half a dozen
firms were already engaged in a similar
business.
The local authorities submitted the
whole matter to the Postmaster-Genera),
the latter deciding that sucn a scheme was
clearly a violation of the postal laws. In
support of this position be refers to sec
tion 654 of postal laws and regulations,
which nays:
"Nothing herein contained shall be con
struei to prohibit the conveyance or trans
mission of letters or packet* by private
hands without compensation, or by spe
cial messenger for the particular occasion
only."
It ia said that there are several privmt*
firms in San Francisco conducting a deliv
ery business along the lines suggested by
the Merchants' Special Bill Comoanv
The matter will be looked into carefully
by Mr. Manro and the law stringently en
forced.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1896.
IT WAS PITCH
AND NOT HONEY.
The Newsboys Had a Pic
nic Near Lotta's
Fountain.
A TERRIBLE SETBACK.
The Bursting of a Barrel Affords
Amusement for the
People.
MICKEY O'BRIEN'S PHALASX.
They Besmear tbe Car Tracks and
Decorate a Policeman With
Sticky Pitch.
Mickey O'Brien, the street arab who hit
a streetcar conductor with a brick the
other day because he kicked him off a
Third-street car, quit selling papers yes
terday afternoon.
He was too busy having fan, and this
being a week of holidays anyhow he added
one day to the list and had a merry picnic.
The pleasure was so much greater that
it was unexpected.
A well-laden truck, piled high with gro
ceries and topped with a forty-gallon cask
of honey, slowly rattled no Market street.
Suddenly there was a lurch, the cask wob
bled and toppled, falling to the basalt
pavement ten feet below.
The impact was so great that the barrel's
head flew oat and what the boys took to
be bright, limpid honey emptied itself at
the shnne of Lotta's fountain.
There were fifty newsboys around at the
time, and they immediately suspended
business to engage in pastime more agree
able.
"Talk 'bout your land c' sunshine, fruit
an' flowers!" exclaimed Mickey; "get on
to yer land o' honey."
There was a wild scramble. Mickey and
his business competitors made a rush and
came together in the most approved style
of football mix-ups.
Little, dirty hands scooped at) the juicy,
toothsome liquid, clothes, none too clean
before, were besmeared, and eager mouths
were filled with nasty, dirty pitch.
Oh ! but it was such a comedown. In
stead of sweet honey it was mouth-puck
erine pitch.
Tne first disappointment over, the news
boys made the best of it by adapting
themselves to circumstances.
It was late in the afternoon, when the
people were rushing to catch their cars.
Everybody was homeward bound, whether
toward the ferries or toward the park, and
as usual Lotta's fountain was the most
sought-for point of embaikation on the
streets.
In the crush of humanity the emptied
barrel and the pond of pitch passed un
noticed. The newsboys assisted in the de
ception by standing everywhere and in
everybody's road. To reach the cars the
peop.e bad to rush and mire themselves
in the sticky spill.
Ladies, with dresses trailing, babies
toddling by their sides, waded through
the gummy stuff only to find themselves
hopelessly stuck before being
by willing hands on the outer edge.
This i>itch was not of the watery brand
easily got rid of, but rather of the pine
nitch kind that knows how to take hold.
One unfortunate lady, in a hurry to
catch the ferry to Oakland, plnnged right
into the pool. The crowd yelled with de
light at her discomfiture while she was
trying to become loosened. She was ter
ribly embarrassed and flurried. In her
excitement she slipped. The newsboys
were in their glory. Down she fell, and
thearabs were in their serenth heaven.
But the poor woman was-a pitiable sight.
A lew sympathizers helped her out, and
incidentally got somewhat "stuck on her"
themselves.
As the night grew on 10.000 people must !
hare looked down that empty barrel, each
person getting the soles of his ftet more â¢
or tesa glued to the pavement.
Mickey O'Brien discovered that the j
electric cars running down Kearny street â 
flashed electric sparks when passing over I
that part of the territory where the pitch !
covers the rails, he soon got his squad of ;
boya together and the lot, armed with
sticks, began smearing the. rails half way â 
to Post street. The result was moat grati- i
fying. The electiic current sent out bright j
bine spalterinfrs that lighted the entire j
street to the delieht of the urchins.
But Mickey ran foul of policeman 821,
MM came on duty at 6 o'clock. He had
gathered a cupful of the pitch and was
carefully daubing the stone posts about !
tue fountain, daubing them so that to sit ;
on any one of them while waiting for a car i
meant to sit there ad infinituni or else '

officer grabbed Mickey by the back of the
neck and the bosom of his pantaloons and
rubbed the itinerant newspaper vender's
nose in the pool of pitch with which he
had been harine bo much fun.
But the phalanx which Mickey headed
was not inactive durine this time. They
let fly their sticEs covered with pitch at
the hostile policeman, and now he will
have to get another uniform.
One or two bicycle riders ran fonl of
the dangerous pool and met with mishaps.
The pitch in quantities proved as slip
pery an ice and the wheels went from un
der their riders.
A few ladies who inadvertently stepped
in the slush fond that their skirts had an
unusual fondness for tbeir ankles. Men
with loose boots lejt them behind, and
scores of ludicrous situations recompensed
the newsboys for their own misadventure
in eating pitch for succulent honey.
GENERAL WARFIELD WINS
The Point of Seniority in the
National Guard Is De
cided.
The Attorney-Genera! Does Not Up
bold tie Claims of General
Holler.
The question as to who is the senior
brigadier-general of the National Guard
of California has been settled. When Gen
eral Dimond went East and after his dtath
Brigadier-General Muller assumed com
mand ;of the State troops, Brigadier-Gen
eral Warfield was of the opinion that
he was entitled to the position and the
matter was submitted to Adjutant-General
Barrett, who in turn consulted with Attor
ney-General Fitzgerald. The latter yes
terday sent the following opinion to the
adjutant-general. It is favorable to the
claims of General Warfield :
iTon. A. W. Barrett, Adjutant-General, Secra
nento. Cat.â Dear Sir: lam in receipt of your
favor of the 16th inst. in which you state that
General Muller was retired under the provis
ions of section 2003 of the Political Code as
amended in 1895 (3tau. 1895, p. 186), which
reads at follows:
The National Guard or the State of California is
hereby organized into three brigades, each com
manded by a briÂ«a<ier-general. the limits of each.
brigade to be fixed by the Commander-In-Chier.
Brisadter-geoerals and tbeir staff officers deprived
of their office by reason of the reorganization here
by provided for, are hereby placed on the retired
list with meir rank.
That thereafter, on the 15 th day of May, 1895.
General R. H. War field was commissioned as
Brigadier-General; and that subsequently, on
October 10, 1595, General Muller, then -upon
the retired list, was. appointed brigadier-gen
eral of the Third Brigade "to r*nk from No
vember 16, 1591." In reply to your question
as to which of these gentlemen,- in view of a
leave of absence granted to the Division Com
mander, "should be in command of the divis
ion," I am of the opinion that this duty de
volves upon General Warfieid. -
Paragraph 13. found in article 111 of the rules
and regulations ot the National Guard (p. 69).
provides that "Officers and non-commissioned
officers rang in each grade In accordance with
the date given in their commissions or war
rants."
Subdivision 5 of section 1973 of the Political
Code provides that "officers on the retired
list shall on all occasions of duty and all oc
casions of ceremony take rank next to officers
of like rank upon the active list." It is mani
fest from these provisions that while General
Muller was upon tne retired list he ranked be
low General Warfield, who was upon the active
list.
The subsequent appointment of General
Muller to the command of the Third Brigade
was not In the nature of a reappointment or
reinstatement as bridadler-general. but was
in effect an original appointment to that rank,
and could not, therefore, affect the relative
positions ot himself and General Warfieid.
That portion of General Muller't commission
which provided that he should "rank from
November 16,1891," was not authorized by any
law of this State or any regulation of the Na
tional Guard, and was, for that reason, sur
plusage. Therefore General Warfield is. in
my opinion, "the senior brigadier-general en
titled to the command of the division." .: â 
THE REVISED RULES
Concerning the Appointment of Teach- i
ers and Contagious Diteases.
Among the new rules recently adopted .
by tbe Board of Education ia section 131,
which reads as follows:
Pupils who are affected with, or in whose
families there may be any contagious or in
fectious disease, including scarlet fever,
diphtheria, whooping cough, cholera, con- â 
sumption, opt h aim Ia (sore eves), scabies (itch), |
etc., shall not be allowed to remain in or to <
return to school, except that the certificate of
the physician, countersigned by the Health
Officer, that there is no danger of contagion or
infection, or that the danger has passed, may
authorize the principal* of schools to receive
such pupils.
The only new feature in this rule is that
it enumerates the list of so-called "con- ;
tagious diseases."
Dr. Clinton, who is on* of the active
members of the Board of Education, ex
plained that this rule was hastily adopted
and would be revised at the next session of
the Directors, so as not to exclude from
admission into the public schools the chil
dren of consumptive parents. "The old
rule," said Dr. Clinton, "was the same in
substance, only it did not specify what
diseases were included under the head of
'contagious.' Measles should also be
added to the list of contagious diseases."
Concerning the appointment of teachers
tbe Board of Education has adopted a new
rule, providing that "when the day sub
stitute class (of thirty-six teachers) falls
below twenty-four each Director shall
nominate two candidates for tbe vacancies,
who shall then pass an examination."
Under the old rule the responsibility of
ti;e examination and the appointments
was vested chiefly in a committee of the
faculty of the University of California.
CRESS FROM THE SWAMP.
Rancher MrDonough Reprimanded for
Allowing Hit Coira to Feed In
the Â»an Bruno Mormas.
Patrick McDonougb. who was com
plained of by Milk Inspector Dockery for
allowing his cows to graze in the San
Bruno marshes, was before the Board of
Health yesterday to show cause why his
permit to sell mUk should not be revoked.
He testified that he had set a man to
watch his cattle and see that they did not
feed in unclean places, but that' his em
ploye bad neglected his duties.
He was reprimanded and told that a re
petition of his offense would result in his
losing his license.
Dr. Morse, while explaining that it was
about time to make an example of some
one in the matter, stated that the pest
house sewer emptied iuto the morass in
which the cows were feeding, and also
that he had heard that the watercress
used in many of tbe local restaurants was
from near the mouth of the
drain.

BISHOP HENDRIX HERE.
Came to Accept a Large Dona
tion for the Methodist
Church South.
Land Given by Rev.- Winters of HolÂ«
listerâ Will Preach Here and
in Oakland.
E. R. Hendrix of Kansas City, Mo.,
bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church
South, arrived at the Palace yesterday.
Bishop Hendrix came to California a
short time ago to arrange for the transfer
to the board of missions of his church of
property valued at 1*25.000 and consisting
of 300 acres of choice land in Santa Clara
Valley. The property is the gift of the Rev.
W. M. .Winters of Hollister, San tfenito
County.
After completing the business at Hol
lister Bishop Hendrix, who is accompanied
by his wife, visited Monterey, Dal Monte
and Santa Cruz and then came here.
Next Sunday morning he will preach in
Dr. Briggs' pulpit in this City and in the
evening will preach in Oakland. On Mon
day he will start for home by way of Salt
Lake and Denver.
Last fall he passed through San Fran
cisco on his way from China bearing a
message from the great Chancellor, Li
Hung Chang, to the United States. It
was just after tbe massacre of the mission
aries that he saw tbe wonderful old Chi
nese statesman.
"He said to me in that interview," re- j
marked the Bishop yesterday, " 'Say to
the American people for me to send out
more missionaries for the schools and hos- j
pitals, and I hope to be in a position both
to aid and to protect them.' That they
were not idle words appears from his
edict shortly afterward removing compli
cations interfering with the Christian re- !
ligion. You know, Grant after bis tour of
the world said that he had met three great
statesman â Gladstone, Bismarck and Li
Hung Chang. He is certainly a wonder- !
ful man. His insight into the affairs of |
nations is remarkable. As soon as 1 was
presented to him he began asking the \
most analytical questions in regard to men !
and governments I had recently yisited.
"I said, 'I hope you will come to Amer- j
ica some time and see our people.'
" 'I am an old man,' he replied, 'but I !
may travel yet. Would you let me run for I
President? 1 he asked, laughing. 'Xo,' I j
said, 'but we might let you run for a ,
Cabinet position.' 'Ah! that would do,' |
replied the agsd statesman.
"He has built two hospitals himself and |
is deeply interested in educational work. '
Ot) to the time I saw him he had been out
of China but once and then only to Japan, !
but his present trip I have no doubt will j
result in a visit to America, ana pernaps I
to San Francisco on his way home."
Bishop Hendrix is one of the nine I
bishops of his church in the United States. !
During President Grant's administration
toe visited the foreign missionary fields
and made a report. Subsequently he vis
ited Europe with personal letters from
Grant to persons of prominence.

NOTARY PUBLIC.GRAIN RATES
SLASHED AGAIN.
Traffic Manager Mess
Wields the Bowie With
Telling Effect.
CUT TO SAN FRANCISCO.
Fifty Cents a Ton From Stockton
to Vallejo, Port Costa or
This City.
DEAL WITH A WATER-CARRIER
The New Schedule Went Into Opera
tion Yesterday and Is the
Lowest on Record.
Rates were put into operation by the
Pan Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railway Company yesterday that will per
mit shipments to be made direct to San
Francisco, Port Costa or Vallejo, as well as
to Stockton, from any point which that
railroad touches; and more than this, such
shipments will take a cheaper rate than
has ever before been enjoyed by the pro
ducers of the section benefited.
These new rates to San Francisco, Port
Costa and Vallejo are made 'n connection
with the California Navigation and Im
provement Company, which will operate
a line of steamers, as oatJined in The Call
yesterday, between Stockton, San Fran
cisco, Vallejo and Port Costa.
In its latest tariff, made to meet the
competition of the Valley road, the South
ern Pacific Company quoted larjrely re
duced rates not only to Stockton, but to
Port Costa, Vallejo and San Francisco,
notwithstanding that the Valley road had
quoted rates to StocKton only. By the
new Southern Pacific schedule the rate
between Siockton and Vallejo or Port
Costa was fixed at 50 cents, and between
Stockton and San Francisco at $1. It was
to meet these rates of the Southern Pacific
to San Francisco, Vallejo and Port Costa
that the traffic arrangement with the
California Navigation and Improvement
Company was made.
The latest schedule of the Valley road
more tiian meets the cut of its bin rival!
It makes an all-round rate of 60 cents per
ton from Stockton to either Vallejo, Port
1.-ta or San Francisco. The schedule in
full ia as follows:
These rates apply to grain in carloads of
24,000 pounds and upward, and are in
cents per ton of 2000 pounds. They went
into effect yesterday. The rates quoted
beyond Stockton are subject to changes in
traffic arrangements with carriers .by water
from that point.
In this schedule is also included a reduc
tion of 5 cents from Empire to Stockton.
This is now $1 10. The reduction was
made to meet the if 1 10 rate quoted by the
Southern Pacific from Modesto, which
station is in connection witn both Clau
ston and Empire of the Valley road.
Up to July 1 of thi9 year the steamer
rate for grain from Stockton to Port Costa,
Vallejo or Sau Francisco was 75 cents per
ton, but on the first of the present month
(>0 cents was quoted from Stockton to Port
Costa and \ allejo and 50 cents to San
Francisco, so that the new rates make a
reduction on even the previous steamer
rates.

CONTEMPT OF COURT.
An Electrician Calls Down on His Head
the Wrath of Judge Mor
row.
F. C. Engineer, employed by the Edison
Electric Light and Power Company, came
very near yesterday having to spend five
days in jail because of a saucy answer re*
turned the Deputy Marshal in attendance
on Judge Morrow's court.
Ensinger, with a large force of men, is
engaged in putting electric lights through
out the Federal buildings. Necessarily
the work of placing the wires caused con
siderable noise, particularly in the Dis
trict Court, the men being at work directly
under the courtroom.
Judge Morrow ordered the work stopped
during the session of the court, but En
singer refused to desist. He said ne was
working under orders from Washington
and would stop only by similar instruc
tions or by the order of his employer".
Ensinger was immediately arrested for
contempt of court and on being brought
before Judge Morrow was sentenced to
five-days' imprisonment. The foreman
saw that he had made a mistake and forth
with made a lengthy apology. He was
released under the promise never to again
disturb the dignity of the court.
WOMEN REPUBLICANS.
The State Club Had a Good Attendance
at Its Meeting .Last
Night.
Mrs. Addie E. Ballou presided over the
Women's State Republican Club last night
in Justice Grbezinger'a courtroom.
There were a good many well-known
Republicans present from the Phoenix
Club and Continental League, besides a
large attendance of the lady members of
the club.
Short speeches were made by Dawson
Mayer ana J. Keliy of the Phoenix Club.
Mrs. Bailey spoke of the Republican
party as being the only party from which
tbe women may expect tbe right of suf
frage. She said she would rather be a
Republican without a vote than a Demo
crat with two votes.
Major C. W. Kyle, in one of his eloquent
addresses, praised the Republican women
of San Francisco for the services rendered
by them in the interest of the party, and
hoped that the day mierht not be far dis
tant until they go side by side with their
fathers, brothers, husbands and sons to
the polls and assist in framing law* under
which they shaii live.
This is one of the constitutional rights
given the men, and it should be given to
women also. Taxation without represen
tation meant a great deal to the American
people, and because it did in the past revo
lutionize nations, it will now in tbe near
future revolutionize politics throughout
this land.
Judge Campbell bowed to the women
and made a short address on the suffrage
question which was well received.
C. H. Clear of the Republican County
Committee followed with a few well-timed
remarks, and finished by singing the cam
paign song, "The Workmen's Jubilee."
Dr. Burgess, Mr. Leavitt and others fol
lowed, after which Mrs. Ballou in a neat
speech thanked the men for their visit and
promised to assist the Republican party^to
a grand victory next November.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1896.
REV. DR. BROWN
SAYS FAREWELL.
Affecting Scenes at Last
Night's Prayer
Meeting.
HIS FARTING CHARGE.
Nervous Prostration Is Alleged
as the Reason for His
Departure.
CERTAIN REPORTS DENIED.
Efforts May Be Made to Continue the
Work of tbe "Independent
Church."
"Bat you, beloved, building yourselves
up on your most holy faith, praying in the
Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love
of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord
Jesus Christ unto eternal life."
In these words of St. Jude the Apostle,
his yoice trembling and husky, the Rev.
Dr. Charles Oliver Brown delivered his
parting charge to the faithful flock which
had gathered with its pastor for the usual
Wednesday night prayer-meeting.
Golden Gate Hall was nearly rilled with
a devout throng, and the opening exer
cises were of the usual informal sort. A
few words of promise and good cheer were
read by the pastor from the Scriptures
with brief but simple and direct comments
and explanations, and a number of oid
lashioned devotional hymns were sung,
tne piano accompaniment being played by
the pastor's son.
Then came the testimonies. In simple
speech member after member recounted
trial" endured witn patience, temptations
I resisted and graces received, while others
asked for prayers in behalf of perplexed
and tormented soulp.
The pastor'a wife gave the first signal of
the parting.
"1 shall always thank God," she said in
a low tone without rising from her seat,
"wherever 1 may go that the friendships
1 have met here have beea the true and
lasting friendships of Christian people."
"And I," said a kindly faced old lady,
"having been brought here by a feeling of
mingled curiosity and sympathy, have
remained because the members of this
isolated congregation have made me feel
at home."
Deacon Dexter said a few words abont
the beauty of Christian fellowship, and
was followed by Deacon Morse, who spoke
most toucningly in the same strain. Other
testimonies were given in rapid succession,
many of which referred directly to the
pastor and his work, and all of which
seemed to be dominated by a note of sor
rowful foreboding.
"It is my principal duty," said the pasÂ»
tor, when all who desired had spoken, "to
wish you farewell for a time â perhaps for
a long timeâ God alone can cay."
The effect of this announcement was
strangely noticeable. It was as though a
pall of deathlike silence hae fallen upon
the assemblage.
"During the past few months," went on
the reverend doctor, "I have passed
through a time of trial the like of which
few men have known. Months ago tbe
doctors ordered me to take a rest, but by
making us* ot toy will power I was able to
keep ahead with'm v duties and hays done
so until now. At length, however, I feel
myself breaking down. One of my sons
has invited me to go and rest with aim,
and there 1 intend to go.
"But there is one thing I would impress
upon you. In all the tempestuous and
troublesome times through which we
have passed I am sure none of you have
heard me say one word against the old
First Church. 1 now beg of yon all,
whether I return or not, to keep in the
bonds of Christian fellowship and love. I
leave you in the hands of God, knowing
that in any event you will be guided into
ways of peace and comfort. And now
that I have to say farewell I must try to
express some of the gratitude which I feel
toward those who stood by me in my hour
of direst need, but when I remember â
when I thinkâ lâ"
The pastor's voice died away, and amid
the silence low sobs commenced to make
themselves heard. Grief, of a sort more
ueep than demonstrative, seemed to take
possession of the assembled worshipers,
and for awhile no one spoke. At length
Deacon Morse addressed the meeting.
"Those of us who have been near our
pastor," he said, "have noticed that he is
failing day by day. Frequently he has
barely been able to finish the Sunday
services. He needs rest. Whether he will
a<:ain be seen among us God knows. We
hope to have nim for our father and friend
for many long years to come, but whether
we shall see our hope realized or not lies
in tbe secret of devine providence. We
can only say our love and our prayers will
always follow him."
Young and old then offered tearful
words of affectionate and reverent fare
well. Tie situation was becoming
strained and Dainful to all present. The
"sweet sorrow" of parting seemed to have
more of sorrow tban of sweetness, and
the pastor sought to end the ngony by
giving the people his blessing and dismis
sing the meeting. But for upward of an
hour the tearful crowd lingered.
Dr. Brown declined politely bnt posi
tively to say anything as to his future
movements. Deacon Morse, however,
was more communicative.
"We all consider this determination of
Dr. Brown in the light of a great priva
tion," he remarked. "At the same time,
any one can realize that the man is at
present a physical wreck owing to the
nervous prostration which has seized upon
him. Rest alone can save save him. He
will in all probability leave tne City before
Sunday. W nether he will return and
when is a question, but we all hope he
will.
"A strangely distorted report was circu
lated this evening as to the doctor's al
leged inability to secure a pass to Chicago.
Dr. Brown did not ask for a pass at all. I
made application for one without asking
him for permission to do so. Mr. Fill
more simply told me he could not give me
one, and that was the end of the matter.
"I anticipate that the 'Independent
Church' will continue in existence irre
spective of Dr. Brown's retaining pastoral
charge over it. The average attendance
at trie services has been about r>oo, even in
this present season of outings, while tha
subscriptions, donations and collections
have been generous. The 'Independent
Church' is financially solvent beyond all
cavil. As to luture services, announce
ment will be made in Saturday's papers."
Other members took a similar vfcw of
things, and references to the council and
its personnel were frequent and spirited,
one venerable participant in the trial be
ing characterized as "the Pope of Califor
nian Congregationalism for seven years
past."
The general impression seems to be that
in case Dr. Brown decides to resume his
pastoral w<>rK in this City he will encoun
ter no difficulty in gathering a devoted
flock about him.
McPIKE SCOFFS
AT LEES' THEORIES.
Declares That the Old Man
Is Not What He
Used to Be.
FORGERT TRIAL CLOSING
All the Evidence Is Now In
and Argument Has Al
ready Begun.
HOTEL EMPLOYES PXAMINED
Bellboys. Clerks and Chambermaids
Add Their Little Mites of
Evidence.
All the evidence in the trial of Becker
and Creegan for forgery is now in, and
probably the arguments will be finished
by this afternoon. Possibly by to-morrow
morning a verdict will have been reached
and the guilt or innocence of the two de
fendants determined.
Yesterday's testimony established strong
ly the fact hitherto unproven â that
Becker was In this State at the time of
the forgery. Numerous hotel employes
from Oakland and Sacramento identified
him aa having been in these cities. Some
expert testimony on the process of raising
a draft was aleo given by Captain Lees and
Expert Gnmpel. The value of Captain
Lees' expert testimony was somewhat dis
counted by Attorney McPike in his argu
ment.
G. W. Kingstury, the cashier of the
Lick House, was the first witness called.
He testified that Dean or Seaver, under
the name of A. D. Howe, had registered at
the Lick House on November 26 and re
mained until th? sth of December. The
hotel register with Dean's signature was
introduced in evidence.
Miss Kate .Brady, â  chambermaid at the
Galindo Hotel in Oakland, testified that
she had seen Becker at the hotel, where he
had occupied rooms 54 and 55. Becker had
been at the hotel over a week, and kept
his room nearly all the time except when
the chamtermaid was doing her work in
the room. He had told her always to lock
the door of his room wheD she got through
with her work.
C. E. Harrison, the clerk of the Golden
Eagle Hotel at Sacramento, identified
Becker ns the man who had registered at
the Golden Eagle on November 30. 1895, un
derthe name of A.L.Dresspl,and remained
until December 7. At the Golden Eagle as
at the Galindo Becker remained most of
the time In his room.
Charles Walsh, the elevator-boy of the
Golden Eagle, corroborated the statement
of Clerk Harrison, that Becker, or Dressel,
had kept to nis room nearly all the time
he was at the hotel.
Cornelius Geebel, the bellboy of the ho
tel, also identified Becker as the man
Dressel who had stopped at the hotel.
Lizzie Morrison, a chambermaid at the
hotel, also recognized Becker as the man
who had staid at the Golden Eagle.
Cashier Michael F. Bray of the Grand
Hotel in this City identified Creegan as
the man who had registered at the Grand
on November 30 as J. P. Holland of Chi
cago. Creegan Had remained a guest at
the hotel until December 17.
B. F. Schanhoff, a druggist on Seventh
street, near Broadway, identified a satchel
shown nim as being very similar to a
Batchel ieft at his store by McCloskey.
Train Agent H. C. Hubbard identified
Becker as the man whose signature he had
required to identify his railroad ticket.
Becker had written the name of C. L.
Werner, and had been accompanied by a
man giving the name of J. Harris.
Captain Lees took the stand and mod
estly admitted that he had had some
forty years' experience in detective work.
He had known of Becker for a long time
and knew him to be an expert with pen
and brush. He had examined the $22,000
check ana had it photographed. The
photographic copy showed more plainly
the defects of the draft than the original.
As tending to show his competency to
examine the drafts Captain Lees admitted
that he had raised many checks himself,
but merely for experiment. With the aid
of a lens the captain then proceeded to
examine the check. The name "A. H.
Dean' and the letters ' - twe" had been left
intact. The letters "nty" had been added
after extraction. The "nty" and the first
"2" in the 22000 were of a slightly different
colored ink from the rest of the writing.
Furthermore the captain detected that the
"2" bad been changed from a "1" and
after the "twe" the indistinct trace of the
loop of an "1" was visible.
Captain Lees' testimony was inter
mingled by some expert testimony ot
Coiner A. T. Spotts of the Mint in regard
to the marking of $20 pieces coined at the
Mint in this City. The detective then
proceeded with his expert examination of
the draft. He gave as his opinion that in
the work a fine camel's hair brush or
pencil and also a fine pen had been used.
In making the catches where the perfora
tions had been, Lees declared that a very
sharp knife and a block of some bard
wood or substance had been used.
More hotel employes were examined at
the opening of the afternoon session.
First, however, John Bedford, a Pullman
car porter, testified that Becker and Cree
gan had got on his car at Sixteenth street,
Oakland, and had ridden to Tracy, where
they had changed to the Santa Fe car.
The porter transferred their luggage,
which consisted of one small and two
large grips.
Manager Carlson of the Galindo Hotel.
Oakland, testified that Becker had stopped
at his hotel from December 7 to 18.
Becker bad first been assigned a room at
the hotel facing the court, but he had ob
jected to this and was given a suite facing
on the street. G. R. Sharp, the night
clerk at the hotel, had seen Becker and
another man come out of the former's
room at the Galindo. He could not iden
tify Becker's companion, but thought he
was taller. Elmer Hartman, a waiter at
the Galindo, corroborated the previous tes
timony as to Becker's habit of keeping to
bis room. Detective Seymour was callea
and identified the satchel which he had
got from Druggist Schunhoff at 460
Seventh street, Oakland.
M. Gumpel, a lithographer and an
expert on handwriting, gave it as his
opinion that the signatures upon the rail
road tickets, hotel registers and other
memoranda were written by the same
person. The witness was then given the
forged dralt and proceeded, with the aid
of a magnifying glass and a blackboard, to
give an exposition from an expert's point
of view. He detected various slurs in the
forged writing, showing that it bad not
been done with a Den, but with a brush.
At the conclusion of Expert Gumpel's
testimony Mr. Black stated that the pros
ecution here rested. The defense had no
additional evidence, and the argument of
the case begirt. According to agreement
the defense opened the argument.
Attorney McPike opened his argument
with a few compliments to Captain Lees.
The attorney admitted having made a
mistake in asking to have Lees excluded.
"We thought," said McPike, "that Cap
tain Lees was what he was twenty years
ago and that he might injure the chances
of the defendants. Bat Captain Lees of

the Brotherton case, Captain Leps of
world-wide reputation is a very different
man from Captain Lees of to-day. If he
was the same Captain Lees he would not
have allowed Dean and"McCloskey, two of
the slickest thieves that ever the sun
shone on, to escape."
Attorney McPiKe proceeded to review
some of Lees' theories. "Captain Lees,"
he affirmed, "is a great iheorizer. When
he drops onto a theory he sticks right to it
and nothing can shake him off it. After
he had Dunn in custody the veteran de
tective formulated a theory that there
were others engaged in the Nevada Bank
forgery and that Dean could not have
done it alone. 'Dean,' he said, after hav
ing taken him around on various occasions
to the Cliff, to the park and the prize-fight,
'Dean, you didn't forge that draft â you
couldn't. You're only an ordinary coun
terfeiter, only convicted twice of counter
feiting. You can make greenbacks that
will defy all but expert scrutiny, but you
can't raise a draft.' Dean readily dropped
on and was quite positive that he could
not.
"Having formed his theory the captain
immediately set out to fit the facts to it.
He helped to secure McCloskey's acquit
tal, for it was a part of his theory that
Creegan, not McCloskey, was Dean's ac
complice. If Captain Lees had used all
his efforts to convict Dean and McCloskev,
the arch-criminals, that he used to defend
them, the trial of these defendants would
never have taken place."
At the conclusion of Attorney McPike' s
remarks which, he said, were but a gen
eral introduction to the argument for the
defense, Judge Wallace adjourned court
until this morning at 10 o'clock, when the
argument will be resumed. In all prob
ability the case will go to the jury before
this evening.
SOCIALISM AND ECONOMY.
K. T. Kingsley Delivers an Address at
the Temple.
Liberty Branch of the Socialist Labor
party was addressed at hut night's mass
meeting in the Temple, 115 Turk street.
The chairman, Henry Warnecke, out
lined the political objects of the Socialist
Labor party and referred to the address of
the evening as very appropriate at a
time when the economic fallacies of the
day are causing many supporters of the
old parties to sever their allegiance thereto.
After a reading from a socialistic journal
by the secretary of the branch, Theodore
Lynch, the chairman introduced E. T.
Kingsley, State organizer of the party,
who said: If I were to aak your attention
to-night to a question that affected money,
tariff or some of the other unimportant
questions, you would be far from the
cause of the evils, that infest society.
Foolish people, who claim that socialism
is the product of a partr'cular nation, are
daily receiving an object lesson in the
economic field. Every intelligent man to
day in this country knows that socialism
is the child of economic conditions.
"The workers of America are face to face
to-day with a condition of things that
must inevitably end in their complete
degradation to abject slavery or revolu
tion if those who love their country and
their fellow-beings negiect the advantages
that socialism offers to adjust the society
we live in on a more harmonious basis.
We are living to-day in the heroic age â
an age in which the chivalry of youth can
again emulate the spirit of liberty that
animated the heroes and patriots of days
gone by."
Short speeches by strangers and econ
omic inquirers followed, and among them
were remarks by Rev. J. E. Scott, Leo
Gasser, "William Edlin and Theodore
Lynch.

The West Coast Company's
Factory Badly Dam
aged.
THREE ALARMS SOUNDED
Much of the Rough Material
in the Shops De
stroyed.
ONLY A SMALL INSURANCE.
The Loss Will Reach a Total of
Nearly F>fty Thousand
Dollars.
One-half of the West Coast Furniture
Company's factory on Fourth and Bryant
streets was destroyed by fire last night.
The blaze caused three alarms to be
sounded from box 63 after 10:20 o'clock.
No sooner had Assistant Chief Engineer
Dougherty, who is acting as Chief during
tne absence of Chief Sullivan, reached the
locality than he realized it was a danger
ous blaze, and had to be conquered
quickly or it would spread.
He immediately caused a second alarm
to be turned in, which brought eleven
engines.
The building is a large brick structure
in the shape of an L, four stories on the
Fourth-street side, three on the Bryant
street front. The former is filled with a
large stock of furniture and the latter part
is where the rough material was worked
up.
It was in this part that the fire was
located, near the boiler-room, and it
spread through the shavings and inflam
mable material with alarming rapidity.
Ten minutes after the second alarm
the third was turned in, and seventeen en
gine companies were soon at work pumping
thousands of gallons of water through the
windows into the fire, which was fortu
nately confined within the brick walls.
In the yard between the L and the street
was the principal seat of operation. Half
a dozen streams were "siamesed" and
the column of water was directed against
the flames, which were steadily progress
ing toward Bryant street.
Lines of hose was carried to the roof of
a couple of small buildings in the yard
and to the top of the main building from
which they were brought to bear upon the
monstrous furnace below.
On the south side of the building is a va
cant lot, and there the water-tower took
up its position and poured a powerful
stream into the windows. Another stream
was directed into the building from the
Perry-street end, which prevented any
spread in that direction.
For a time it was feared that the flames
would Â£et into the main building, not
withstanding the heavy brick fire wall that
separates the two parts. Had the flames
reached tne varnish-room there would
have been a merry blaze, and nothing
short of the total destruction of the build
ing and contents and probably a part of
the surrounding buildings would have
been the result.
But the firemen held their own and Kept
the fire confined in the south L. At mid
night they had the blaze under control.
The wooden and willow ware factory of
Armes & Dallam occupied a part of the
building in the rear, and this place with
the rest went up in smoke.
HOW IT STARTED.
The Origin of the Fire a Mystery to
All Interested.
The watchman, M. Zickyrooff, states
that when he saw the blaze it was under
he stairs leading to the second story, at a
considerable distance from the engine
and fire rooms and nowhere near the
parts where the lumber and shavings were
located.
His story was to some extent corrobor
ated by Frank Miller, a boy who lives at
411 Fourth street. He first saw the fire on
the steps in back of the boiler-room. He
immediately told the watchman, who had
just returned to the office after making his
round of the building.
The watchman turned in an alarm from
the auxiliary box and then hastened to
turn in a regular alarm lrom the box at
Fourth and Harrison streets, after search
ing about the building for a hose.
Several people on the surrounding
streets state that the fire was in the second
story at the west end, and that it seemed
to leap into the third story and through
the rooms on both floors as though along
a train of powder or gasoline.
Tne engineer asserted that it could not
have started in eitner the boiler or shav
ing rooms, as both were inclosed in fire
proof brick walls.
INSURANCE WAS RISKY.
Representatives of Companies Tell
Why Insurance Was
Light.
A representative of the Royal Insurance
Company of London and the Continental
Insurance Company, both of which have
risks on the building, gave the following
statement of facts:
"The insurance on the building is light.
Just what it is, of course, I am not at lib
erty to state.
"It is the class of insurance that goes
begging on the street. Several fires have
broken out in the building before. It in a
part of the Sharon estate, and companies
have been freely offered good risks in all
the buildings of this estate over town if
they would insure this particular one.
"The part fronting on Harrison street
was burnea to the ground about three
years ago, and was replaced by a corru
gated-iron building two stories high, a
solid brick wall separates this from the
adjacent building. It i-> occupied by Chi
nese cigar manuiacturers.
"An American cigar-box factory is on
the ground floor of the building near the
intersection of the two wings. We always
dislike to insure such light and in
flammable material. Besides, the yard was
constantly niled with lumber, sawdust and
shavings. Add to this the fact that the
structure was filled with furniture, oil and
other highly combustible a. tides, ana you
can easily see why we have not taken
heavy risks."
LOSS AND INSURANCE.
Only $12,000 on the Whole Build-
\ng and Scarcely Anything on
the Burnt Portion.
L. Emanuel, one of the proprietors of
the company, reached the building shortly
after the alarm was turned in. When
seen late last niirht he had just come back
after an examination of the stock room,
â where the Underwriters' Patrol men were
busy c vering the furniture with rubber
blankets.
Mr. Emanuel could not venture a guess
as to the loss. The fire destroyed the con
tents of the cabinet-room, consisting of
lumber, machinery and miscellaneous ma
terials. The insurance on the whole
building was only $12,000, and on the
burnt wing of the building there was
scarcely any insurance at ail on account
of the high rate of 6 per cent The insur
ance was placed with the Scottish Com
mercial and various other insurance com
panies, but just which company insured
the destroyed portion it was impossible to
learn.
The loss and damage will not be learned
for several days. Mr. Manuel states that
there was not a very large amount of raw
materials in the part that was gutted, but
others assert that the place was well filled,
as the firm has several large contracts to
fill.
The greatest loss and damage was to the
machinery, which was heated to a white
heat by the flames and then broken to
pieces by the douches ot cold water that
flooded tne building.
It was roughly estimated that Emanuel
<fe Co. will lose between $25,000 and $35,000,
while Armes & Dallam's loss will run be
tween $6000 and $10,000. It is believed
that not less than $50,000 will cover the
loss, to say nothing of the damage to the
building.
A VICTIM OF FIRES.
Emanuel & Co. Have Had a Run of
Very Bad Luck.
The fire fiend seems to have camped
upon the trail of E. and L. Emanuel.
This is about the fourth time they have
been fcjurnt out. Several years ago their
building at the same place was wiped out
by ablaze. Eight years ago the scene of
last night was enacted in the south L,
nearly the whole of that part going up in
smoke.
The big Bancroft fire on Market street
will long be remembered. It started in
Emanuel's furniture store in that fatal
structure and a large stock was then de
stroyed. There have been several small
fires in the factory during the past six
years, but none of a serious nature.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
Crowds Go to See " Romeo and
Juliet" at the Tivoli Opera-
House.
There was no falling off in the attend
ance at the Tivoll last night; indeed the
crowd was so great at the box-office that a
couple of special officers had to labor
diligently to keep impatient hungerers
and thirsters after opera lrom breaking
out of line. Â»
The work given last night was Gounod's
"Romeo and Juliet," for the first time in
this City.
That significant fact shows what an
operatic famine San Francisco has been
enduring, for in the East and in Europe
"Romeo and Juliet" is one of the most
sung works of the French repertory. In
deed at present it almost exceeds "Faust"
in popularity. To attempt a detailed criti
cism of the work at this late day would be
absurd.
In the main the libretto follows the
story of Shakespeare's tragedy, dealing
chiefly with its love element, which it has
treated to a considerable extent in a series
oi dramatic and exquisitely melodious
duets between Romeo and Juliet. The
duel scene has been made much of, and
from a dramatic standpoint forms a mag
niheent foil to the linked sensations iong
drawn out of the love bcenes.
Musically speaking "Romeo and Juliet"
is more modern in its treatment than
"Faust," "Mirella," etc On this account
the rich, almost sensuous melodies in
which it abounds do not strike the ear so
strongly on a first hearing. Those who
were familiar with the opera, however,
could revel last night in the "tunes,"
which after all are what appeal most to
the popular ear. To those who heard it
for the first time "Romeo and Juliet" no
doubt sounded declamatory. As an
operatic drama it is not so stirring and
dramatic as "Faust," though the story is a
tenderer and more exalted one.
The performance was less even than that
given to the "Lucia." In certain scenes it
was brilliant, in otners it left something to
be desired, but on the whole it was one on
which to congratulate the management.
Fernando Michaelena, as Romeo, more
than fulfilled the promise of real dramatic
genius, which be had given as Edgar of
Ravenswood.
All through the long, exacting role he
shone alike as actor and singer.
His round, well-schooled, vibrant voice
was fully equal to all vocal requirements
of bis role. His acting would have been
applauded if ha had only been acting and
not singing. His by-play, particularly in
the dramatic duel scene, was most fin
ished, and in the love passages he was as
tender as he was virile where the role
called for sterner stuff.
Nina Bertini Humphreys was on the
whole a satisfactory Juliet. She will be
remembered as one of the stars of the
Tavary troupe two years ago. It was no
doubt a little hard for her to come after
M me. Natali, who is such a much more
finished yocalift in every respect, but if
Miss Bertini Humphreys' work seemed at
times schoolgirlish compared to that of
the more experienced pntna donna who
preceded her on Monday and Tuesday,
she nevertheless made a charming Juliet,
and in the balcony scene, as well as in the
scene in her chamber, she did some very
oretty work. Her waltz song, which she
sang in French, did not produce the effect
that it generally creates.
John J. Raffael really surprised hiÃ
friends by the excellence of his Mercutio.
He sang the "Queen Mab" aria delight
fully and his duel scene was a fine piece of
acting and singing. Martia Pache made
an excellent Tybalt. The pretty role of
the page was not made the most of by
Miss Russell, who has a fine voice, but
does not know how to use it. Mine. Casati
had so little opportunity of shininc as the
nurse that it might be fairer to defer judg
ing her singing.
As friar, Lawrence Abramoff did excel
lent work.
"Romeo and Juliet" contains splendid
choruses, and too much praise cannot be
the chorus work in the street scene,
which includes the duel. Much of the
other chorus work was good, but this par
ticular scene, both with regard to chorus
and soloists, was trie gem of the per
formance and well deserved the ovation
it received.
Gustave Hinrichs conducted" with his
usual skill. At first it seemed doubtful
whether the public would really enter into
the spirit of the beautiful work, but the
enthusiasm began with the beautiful gar
den scene and it went on crowing.
New and artistic scenery had been
painted for the representation.

COSTLY GIFTS FOR OFFICERS
Grand Banquet, Reception and Enter
tainment at K. R. B Hall in
the Evening,
The Grand Council of the Younp Ladies'
Institute opened yesterday morning with
an address by the Rev. Father Comyns of
St. Charles, the spiritual director of the
Miss Sophia A. Grote, Acting President of the Grand Council, Y. L. I.
organization, who complimented the order
for its efficient work in the past and en
couraged them to reach still farther in
their laudable endeavor to aid the sick,
suffering and destitute with which the
land abounds.
"By their fruits shall ye know them,"
said Father Comyns. "I am happy to
state that the fruits of your labors are
such as to justify me in saying you may
be recognized as a band of noble Christian
workers in the vineyard ot truth."
This address was followed by continu
ing the reading of the minutes of the
grand directors. At the conclusion the
reports of the grand secretary and grand
treasurer were submitted.
That the institute is in a most flourish
ing condition is amply demonstrated by
these reports. The receipts of the past
year aggregated $9320. while the disburse
ments amounted only to $5219.
The reports of the finance, sr.pply, head
quarters and printing committees were
submitted. The report of the finance
committee corroborated that of the tr as
urer. The headquarters committee re
ported having $1125 in the treasury. This
fund was raised by setting apart 2 per
cent of t;e receipts.
These reports were all examined by the
committee on returns and adopted. The
members of this committee are Miss
Nellie Greany. Mrs. A. Wilkes and Mrs.
Sweeney.
At the conclusion of this business there
was an alarm of fire and a recess was de
clared in order to afford the rural dele
gates an opportunity to view the firemen
in action. It proved a false alarm, bow
ever, and the Country delegates must wait
for another opportunity to view the fire
laddies.
Father O'Connell enlivened the morn
ing session with an interesting discourse,
in which he gave the institute some
earnest and timely advice. Success in
any undertaking, he said, depends quite
as much upon the work done by indi
vidual members as upon the harmonious
action of all.
It was learned with gratification that
the organization of a branch institute had
Deen effected at Livermore and that appli
cations had been received from Stockton
and Port Costa to lollow suit.
The committee on returns was notified
that it would be expected to make recom
mendations regarding the expenditures for
the ensuing year, including the subject of
choosing headquarters. This ended the
work of the morning.
In the afternoon an invitation from
Mayor Sutro to visit the Heights and
other points of attraction in the vicinity
was read. The Frawley Company also
extended an invitation to the institute to
attend the play of "London Assurance."
The company was seconced in this cour
tesy by Manager Friedlander, who offered
the liberty of the theater.
The following telegram was received
from the grand president, Mrs. I. Wynne,
now lying very in at her home in Vallejo.
It was addressed to the grand secretary,
Miss Josie Mailoy:
Vallejo, Cal.. July 8.
To the Omeerg and Members of thr F.iqhlh Grand
Council oj the Young Ladle*' Inntttuteâ Many
thanks tor sympathy. My heart and thoughts
are with you. May success attend you.
An amendment to the effect that sick
and death benefits be placed in the by-laws
instead of tue constitution was then
brought forward. T n company with other
am*n:ments it *ill be acted on some time
to-day. The delegates were instructed to
have all their amendments placed upon
the -table rsady for action to be taken on
them this morning.
Some discussion was indulged in anent
a supreme jurisdiction. At present there
is an Atlantic and a Pacific jurisdiction
but the desire has been expresse i that
a supreme jurisdiction be created. Tins
question will receive further consideration
later on.
In the evening a grand banquet, enter

tainment and reception was tendered the
visiting delegates by Young Ladies' Insti
tute No. 1 at K. R. B. Hall, corner of Ma
son and O'Farrell streets.
New officers have recently been elected
in this order, and the ceremony of instal
lation was first conducted witn closed
doors. The installation ceremony was
conducted by Past Grand President Ella
Comyns. Following is the list of newly
elected officers :
President, Miss Kate Driscoll; first vlce-
I president, Miss Mnrgrctte Svan; second vice

Monahan Kate Conklin and Rose Ollwelf;
organist, Miss Lottie Dwyer.
In the name of the order Miss Sophia
A. Grote presented the retiring president,
Miss Kate Fitzoatrick. with a handsome
anu costly gold watch and chain. Miss
Grote embraced the occasion to praise the
r tiring president for the efficiency she
had demonstrated in the discharge of her
manifold official duties, Â»nd thanked her
therefore in the name of Institute No. L
Miss Fitzpatrick replied in a neat
speech, saying the moment was one she
would always remember, and the gift
should b - one of her most carefully cher
ished mementos, coming as it did from
those with whom she had been so long
and so intimately associated. Miss Kate
Gieason, the retiring treasurer was pre
sented with a beautiful pin, also.
A royal "good time" was then enjoyed
by those assembled, which lasted till late
in the evening.

DEATH AT THE BATHS.
Frank Denvin Falls Into an
Empty Tank and Crushes
His Skull
Satro's Famous Resort the Scene of
a Tragedy, Attributed to
Carelessness.
Frank Denvln, the 16-year-old son of
William J. Denvin, a contractor, living at
426 Castro street, received injuries at the
Sutro Baths yesterday resulting in his
death three hours later.
Whether the accident was due to the
criminal carelessness of those in cbarge of
the baths or to young Denvin's own reck
lessness, or both, is a matter of much
speculation. In attempting to climb a
ladder leading to one of the slides the
deceased lost his footing, tumbling to the ;
big tank below. Uis head was first to strike
the hard cement, resulting in a severe
fracture of the skull. The tank was empty,
otherwise the fall might not have resulted I
fatally.
Young Denvin, in company with Mrs. i
de Haven and Bert de Haven, 417 Castro
street, and Mrs. Chappman, 435 Eddy !
street, visited the Cliff House yesterday
with the intention of making a day of it.
About noon the boys determined to take
a plunge before lunch and tor that pur
pose repaired to the bathhouse. There
were a lot of other fun-seekers on band,
and soon t c two boys were making merry
with the throng. It is considered great
sport to slide down the sharp inclines
which lead into the smaller tanks, and it
was while endeavoring to enjoy one of
these exhilarating slides that Denvin met
his death.
Five or six of the young boys attempted
to climb into the slide running into tank
4. They all got up safely except Eu
gene Yanke and Denvin. As the former
was about to step on the platform above
his loot slipped, causing him to fall heav
ily against Denvin. The latter lost his
hold on the ladder, and, falling to
the platform below, bounded into the
empty tank. It is a mooted question
whether the fructure came from the first
obstruction or the cement flooring. His
friends claim that he fell from the ladder
to the tank, never once touching the nar
row platform. The employes at the baths
say, however, that the fracture came from
the impact with the platform.
"I did not see the accident myself,"
said Professor Killick, who has charge of
the life-saving department at the baths,
â¢'but from what I can gather, the boy
struck the platform head first and then
bounded into the tank. It is possible, of
course, that he might not have
touched the flooring at all, but
the surroundings do not favor such I
a thelbry. One of my .keepers caught
young Yanke, thus preventing hiÂ» receiv
ing a fall which migbt also have resulted
fatally. I have cautioned the boys time
and again to be careful, but my warnings
are never heeded. Of course, it there bad
been water in the tank the results might
have been different, though I hardly
think so."
The big tank at Sutro's Baths is emptied
twice each week. Yesterday was the reg
ular day for putting in fresh water. Prior
to the accident there were no ropes guard
ing the platforms bordering on the tank,
but immediately following Denvin's fatal
fall ropes were stretched.

ROCK THAT IS PURE QUARTZ
An Old Tin Pan and a Shovelful of
Earth Yield a Lump of
Yellow Metal.
Jack Hayes of the harbor police is no
longer a silver man, in fact he is a decided
gold bug. His change of metallic prefer
ence too* place a day or two ago. Mr.
Hayes lives in Sausalito among the charm
ing Hurricane Gulchers.
A creek runs behind Mr. Hayes* cottage
and in bis wanderings along its bank Mr.
Hayes has observed the presence of old
fashioned, gold-bearing quartz in large
quantities. Mr. Hayes knows this rock to
be gold quartz, because when he was
younger he spent many a prosperous hour
prospecting on Pikes Peak and vicinity
for this same metal.
Day before yesterday Mr. Hayes said to
his wife, "I believe I will experiment a
little." Accordingly he shouldered a
shovel and bung therefrom a large pan.
He filled the pan full of the prombiug
looking earth and cradled it out in the
good old way. Mrs. Hayes, who tells the
remainder of the story, says she heard
shouting in the neighborhood of the creek
and saw her husband rushing toward the
house, batless, shovelless, but bearing in
his hand the large pan half full of the wet
earth.
As soon as Mr. Hayes recored his breath
sufficiently he gasped, "Look at this," and
held up to the astonished gaze of his wife
two good-sized nuggets of pure, yellow
gold. Mr. Hayes is now negotiating to
buy the lot that adjoins nim on tne creek
side.
"I always wanted the lot," said he,
"but it seems dearer to me now than ever
before. But I hardly think there is very
much metal hereabouts. I found th >c
nuggets in the bed of the creek. It may
have been washed down from up higher
on the ridge.
"All the land around here was first
bought by a man named Miiler as mining
property. It was subsequently sold to
the Sausaiito Land and Ferry Company.
The ground upon the ridge about seven or
eigdt years ago was quite extensively pros
pected for gold, but whether much was
found Or not Ido not know. There may,
of course, be nothing in this; still, next
Sunday, when I have leisure, I intend to
thoroughly examine the locality and wash
quantities of the gravel. Even if it has
washed down from above the creek is
deep enough in gravel to contain a snug
little fortune."
The two nuggets found by Mr. Hayes
are about as large as huckleberries. He

DEMOCRATS TO RATIFY
The Junta and tlie Buckleyltea With
Rival Sh<>Â«->.
Arrangements for the rival local Demo
cratic ratifications went ahead indepen
dently last night and Saturday night.
Democrats may take their choice between
open-air meetings on Grant avenue run
by the Junta and the meeting at the Met
ropolitan Hall which the Buckleyites will
strain every nerve to make a great success.
There was some little street talk yester
day between members of the factions
about getting together in the interest of
the National ticket, and when the Buck
ley ratification committee met at dead
quarters with th<* presidents and secre
taries of the district clubs there was an
understanding that a committee from the
Junta would visit them, but as 10:30 p. M.
arrived and no committee came the pos
sibility was given up and everybody was
in favor of an independent ratification
anyway.

MISCHIEF BENT.
Judge Campbell Deals Leni
ently With the Mas
querader.
SHE MEANT NO WRONG.
His Honor Charitably Ascribes
Her Celebrating Attire to
Foolishness.
HAD IMBIBED TOO FREELY.
Her Attorney Ascribes Her Actions
to Liberal and Injudicious
Hospitality.
Mrs. Mamie Baldwin, or Mamie Roland
as she chooses to call herself when Bbc
slips out of her Dr. Jekyll existence and
impeding skirts into a Hyde spree and
masculine apparel, may not look quite as
interesting in conventional garb as she
did the morning of her arrest, but there is
no disputing Judge Campbell's intimation
that she looks a great deal prettier.
As she sat in the absurdly inadequate
courtroom yesterday afternoon awaiting
sentence she looked anything but the em
phatically new woman who celebrated the
Fourth of July by declaring her inde
pendence of skirts and going forth to
exercise man's inalienable right of v/ear
ing trousers and gazing through the bottom
of a cocktail glass at the frescoed ceiling
of a bonton saloon.
Mrs. Baldwin doesn't look like the
The Woman Charged With Wearing Male Attire in Judge Campbell's Court.
*Oman who would enjoy that sort of thing;
at least she didn't look like it yesterday.
Her round baby facw, albeit there is noth
ing about her proportions to otherwise
suggest a juvenile looking out from be
neath a wide brimmed hat, gave her a sort
of innocent Maud Muller appearance that
fitted ill with tbe imaginary picture of a
young lady of the Standard magazine
type drowning the eagle's scream when
the Fourth ol July was very old in all
ports of wicked tipples, and starting in
with tbe early Fifth to properly receive
the next holiday.
Yet thai same young lady answered
demurely when Judge Campbell read from
h s docket, "Mrs. Mamie Roland, for
masquerading in male attire, has pleaded
jfuilty and up for sentence."
Attorney McGrath, who represented the
young woman, made a brief plea for
judicial clemency. "I would like to
nave your Honor consider that she was
celebrating the Fourth of July," ne said.
"Some friends called on her and they
imbibed a little too freely, perhaps. These
friends bantered her to put on male at
tire and go downtown. She finally put on
her husband's clothesâ"
"But they were not her husband's
clothes," interjected Judge Campbell.
"She testified they were her brother's."
"That wan a mistake," replied the at
torney, lightly; "they were her hus
band's."
The attorney then proceeded to explain
that his client did not know she had vio
lated the law and had had much cause to
regret her foolish escapade.
"Have you anything to say on your own
behalf in this matter?" asked his Honor.
Tbe fair defendant said never a word, and
she was then told to stand up. The attor
neys and the courtroom loafers craned
their necks to get a look at the woman,
but Judge Campbell's remarks were few,
and as she had taken a seat in a retired
corner few were satisfied.
"I will state," said the Judge, "I am
very mnch more impressed with your ap
pearance to-day than I was tbe other day.
1 would strongly advise you never to put
on male attire again. Such practices are
both dangerous and decidedly improper.
"I think you have already been pun
ished thoroughly. You have had your
Picture in the paper and all that sort of
thing. I don't believe your action was
malicions, but more in a spirit of mis
chief. Under the circumstances I will
not send you to jail. Tne sentence of this
court is that you be fined $5, witb no al
ternative." Which is no penalty at all.
Almost before Judge Canipbell had
ceased speaking Mrs. Baldwin, with the
two ladies who had accompanied her, was
hurrying from the room. A sigh of relief
escaped her as she reached the door, and
it is big odds that Mamie will at least
compromise on bloomers when next the
spirit of '76 urgÂ«s her to break from the
thralklom of conventional female attire
and take liberties with the time-honored
prerogatives of the enemy â man.
POINTED RESOLUTIONS.
The Woman's American Protective Ai
â¢ociatlon Pick* Up the Gauntlet of
the Woman's Liberal League.
A-t a regular meeting of the United
Councils' committee of the Woman's
American Protective Association held on
Tuesday afternoon, July 7* the following
resolutions were unanimously adopted :
Whereas, The so-called American Woman's
Liberal League of this City, en organization
formed for the avowed purpose of promoting
equal rights to all, free thought, free speech,
etc.; and whereas, if Die members of the
American Woman's Liberal League are hon
est and conscientious in their belief
aud intend to carry out the principles
embodied in their platform they should
j be willing to grant unto others the privilege
of holding an opinion which may possibly dif
fer from that held by the members of the Lib
eral League, without making them the sub
ject of bcurrilous and bitter attacks through
the columns of the daily press; and whereas,
m e American Woman'u Liberal League has
seen fit to denounce through the columns of
the leading paper* of this City the Merchants'
Association and its honorable secretary,
because the said association and its
secretary have deemed it wise and for
the best interests of the city to
support the proposed new charter; and
whereas, tne cause of the above attack arises
from the fact that a certain clause in the laid
charter makes it compulsory that all teachers
to be employed in the public schools of San
F.-anciÃco shall have received their education
in the public schools of California- and
whereas, they have demanded that the charter
be defeated because it seeks to protect the
schools of this City from the evils of sectarian
ism, which has been forbidden by the con
stitution of the State and the United States;
and whereas, the object of this organisation
and the action it has taken is to open the
door for the introduction of ecclesiastical con
trol and instruction in bigotry and sectarian
ism, be it therefore
Jietolved, That we the United Councils' com
mittee of the Woman's American Protective
Association condemn the American Woman's
Liberal League as being un-American in its
practices, which are entirely contrary to the
principles embodied in their platform ; and be
it further
Hesolval, That we denounce the attack upon
the Meri-hdut.s' Association and its secretary,
and declare that such attacks as have been
made upon J. Richard Freud as being un-
American and illiberal, and which only could
emanate from miuds which have received their
early training in an atmosphere or school
which breed only Digots aud shallow-braiued
fanatics; and further
Resolved, That vÂ»e indorse most beartily that
clause in the preposed new charter which pro
hibits any but those who were educated in the
public schools of California from teaching
therein ; and be it further
Resolved, That we believe and hold that it
our public schools are not pure and good
enough to receive their education therein,
they shouldâ to be consistent â consider them
selves too good to enter as teachers; and be it
sti' 1 . further
Resolved, That this disloyal attack upon this
provision in the proposed new charter is in
sulting to the intelligence of those who have
been educated in our free public schools, like
wise an insult to the honorable gentleman
who framed tne charter; further
Rftolvtd, That we, as loyal American women,
pledge ourselves to support and do all in our
power be an organization to have the charier
adopted at the coming election; and further
Resolved, That we consider it the duty of
every loyal citizen of the City and County of
Son Francisco who favortt home talent and
public schools free from religious or sectarian
teachings to give his hearty support and use
his influence for the proposed charter at the
coming election, to be held in Novamber. 1896.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1896.
MAY SHEATH
HE RATE KNIFE,
Fares and Freights to Port
land Likely to Be
Restored.
OFFICIALS TO CONFER
Exodus of a Number of Promi
nent Railroad Men North
ward Bound.
A HEW DEAL IN PROSPECT
Sale of the 0 R. and N. Co.'s Prop.
ertyâ Details of the Proposed
Reorganization Plan.
Within the next few days a conference
will take place at Portland, Or., between
officials of the Southern Pacific Company,
of the Oregon Railway ana Navigation
Company and of the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company, which will in all probabil-
ity result in rates, both passenger and
freight, being advanced.
For nearly ten months a determined
rate war has waged between the Southern
Pacific and the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation Company with disastrous results to
the revenues of both companies, the issue
being the proportion of business etch was
entitled to.
Before the war the passenger rate by
steamer was tls first class and 57 50 sec
ond class, and by rail $25 nrst class and
$16 50 second class. During tbe struggle
for business these were cut to $5 for first
class steamer passage and $2 50 for second
class and to $10 for first-class rail transpor
tation and $5 for second-class fares.
Though not directly interested in the
fight tbe Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany was by force of circumstances in
self-protection compelled to cut its rates
between here and Puget Sound ports from
$20 for first-class fares and $10 for second
class to $8 and $5 respectively.
Freight rates also came down with a
crash. The Southern Pacific rates for
first-class goods was $1 30 per hundred
pounds and other classes in proportion.
The contest brought the first-class rates
down to 40 cents per hundred pounds and
the lower classes tumbled in proportion.
These rates applied from all California
terminals north of Lathrop. Later a spe
cial tariff was issued by the Southern Pa
cific Company from San Fiancisco only
making a rate of 12J^ cents per hundred
pound? for tbe first fonr classes in less
than carload lots and of 10 cents p*er hun
dred in carload lots.
Steamer freight rates followed the down
ward trend. From 75 cents per 100 pounds
for hrst-class freight tbe rate dropped to
30 cents, and in proportion rates went
down all along the scale, from Portland
southbound. Northbound freights fell to
$1 a ton of 2000 pounds or forty cubic feet.
At the recent meeting in this City of the
Transcontinental Passenger Association
the general passenger agents of the South
ern Pacific Company and of the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company were
appointed a committee to settle the differ
ences between the two companies, but this
was looked upon m railroad circles simply
as a pleasantry.
To-day the sale of the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company under foreclos
ure proceedings will take place at Port
land, Or., and it is believed that under the
reorganized administration will come a
favorable opportunity for adjusting the
troubles of the past.
On Tuesday night's train J. C. Stubbs,
traffic manager of tbe Southern Pacific
Company; H. R. Judah, assistant general
passenger agent, who has charge of the
passenger business of the Shasta route of
the Southern Pacific Company ; William
Sproule, assistant general freight agent,
who looks after tbe Southern Pacific freight
interests on the name line, left for Port
laud. On the same train there also de
parted for the same destination J. G.
Woodworth, assistant to the receiver end
general manager of the Oregon Railway
and Navigation Company, who has been
in the City for the past four days, and
Edwin Goodail of the Pacific Coast Steam
ship Company.
It is no secret among railroad men that
this simultaneous exodus of these repre
sentatives of the hitherto clashing inter*
ests portends a conference having in view
the signing of a joint treaty of peace.
Under the plan of reorganization, the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Company
will undergo a slight modification in the
title. The word "railway ' will simply be
changed to "railroad." This will be done
to conform to the law in the case.
Receiver McNeil will, it is understood,
be president of the road and Mr. Wood
worth the general manager. The latter is
a comparatively young man for the posi
tion he is to fill, and will probably be the
youngest man in the United States in
such an important position. He is said to
have a very wide acquaintance with busi
ness men, and is thoroughly posted on
railroad matters. He was formerly con
nected with the Union Pacific system.
The sale will be simply a matter of form,
and the road will return to tbe control of
the present stockholders, who have guar
anteed the bondholders the interest on
their securities for ten years. All tbe
present staff of officials will in conse
quence be retained, and the road will re
tain its entire independence.
To just what extent rates will be ad
vanced should an agreement be reached
no one is in position to say, but a serious
disturbing factor will continue to exist in
freight matters at least in the steamers of
the North Pacific Steamship Company,
which company was the real cause of
water freights being forced down to $1 per
ton to Portland.
The new company will probably be in
position shortly after the sale to talk busi
ness with reference to rates. The present
trouble is said to have been one of Hunt
ington's investigations while in this City,
but it is believed that Mr. Stubbs has been
clothed with full power to act for the
Southern Pacific Company.
As the Southern Pacific Company is re
quired to eive ten days' notice under the
interstate commerce act of any change in
rates, it is safe to assume that it will be at
least a fortnight before the new rates be
come operative.
BOYS TO HAVE AN OUTING
Friends and Inmates of the Youths'
Directory Enjoy a Day Under
tbe Trees.
Good Father Crowley r s little wards of
the Youths' Directory are going to have a
grand time to-day. A lovely nook in a
retired corner of Marin County will surely
find its wonted stillness strangely broken
by boyish shouts and songs, while the
birds will have their first opportunity of
singing to the accompaniment of violin,
mandolin, harp and guitar.
The outing promises to be most enjoy
able. About 100 boys will form the larger
portion of the crowd of merry makers, but
will be ably seconded by numbers of the
reverend clergy and other friends. Among
the guests will be the Rev, D. 0. Crowley,
the honored president of the directory;
Miss Nora Sullivan, Mrs. K. Lawlor, Mrs.
J. F. Sullivan, tne Misses Noone, and a
number of musical . people, who intend
giving an impromptu concert under the
trees. Many good things to eat and drink
have been provided, and a number of valu
able and beautiful prizes will be given the
winners in the various ganu-s and racrs.
The railway and streetcar lines have given
the boys free transportation to and from
the picnic grounds, for which they and
their friends are most grateful. A very
enjoyable day i 9 anticipated.

explanation.
The arrow files with the wind. The top figures
: a - station indicate maximum â  temperature for the
days; those underneath It, if any. the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in Inches and hundredth*.
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect polii's of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accomuanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompitnied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior 1
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
â¢ north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb- I
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and !
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer j
' weather may be expected in summer and colder ]
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
v.-il! produce an opposite result.
WEATHER BUREAU REPORT.
United States Dkpabtmknt OF Agricul
ture:, Weathkb BrREAt', San Fbancisco, July
'8, 1896, 5 p. m. Weatner conditions and general
forecast:
The following maximum temperatures are re
ported from stations in California to-day:
Eureka 64, Fresno 110, San Diego 72, Red Bluff
108. San Luis Obispo 84, Yuma 106, San Francisco
68, Los Angeles 82.
San Francisco dataâ Maximum temperature 68,
minimum 55, mean 62.
The pressure has fallen slightly over the north
ern half of the Pacific Coast and has risen slightly
over Nevada and Southeastern California. There
are no well-marked high or low areas and the con
ditions are favorable for generally fair and con
tinned warm weather in the coast states, with â 
cloudy weather and possibly light thunder-storms j
in the interior.
The temperature has risen slowly over | Oregon
and Washington and has fallen in Central Cali
fornia and Northern Nevada. The fall in tempera- ]
ture in Nevada is probably due to light showers.
The temperature has riser, decidedly In Northern
Arizona. Very warm weather has prevailed In
the San Joaquin Valley and the northern portion
of he Sacramento Valley. Within a distance of
100 miles from San Francisco there is a difference
01 60 degrees of temper
Forecast made at san Francisco for thirty hours
ending midnuht, July 9, 1896: '
. Northern â Fair. Thursday; contin
ued warm weather in the valleys; light northwest
erly winds on the coast; probably light fog along
the coast

KEW YORK. N. V.. July The stock mar
ket, while a little livelier than - on yesterday, may
still be called intensely dull.. The total transac
tions were 133,083 : shares. Sugar and tobacco
made exceptional gains of about 2y, the former
rising from 109% to 111% and the latter from
60% to 62%. The rise induced realizations dur
ing i ;it- afternoon under which the whole list yield- I
ed VW&HSS- In the absence of any Known cause,
the decline was ascribed to the news from the Chi
cago convention regarding the tree sllverltes and
the radical measures proposed In the platform.
These matters gave the bears an opportunity to
hammer the list, tint they made comparatively
little impression on prices, and commission houses
reported few offerings for the long account. In
many quarters the belief obtains that the late de
pression in prices fully discounted anything that
the Chicago convention may do in the way of free
silver. At the moment the business' of the ex
change Is confined almost exclusively to the room
traders, but leading operators are expected to
take a hand after the convention takes definite
action. Speculation closed weak in tone.
â  The active stocks showed net losses of i/s to (Â«â¢
per cent. the Grangers leading. Leather preferred
gained %. Jersey Central 1, and Tobacco 1 1/4 on

this level and in the winze below it they continue
to turn over the old fillings, which have been low
in grade for the week, and to follow the streak
going south, which Is of fair. They have saved for

Department.
RECEPTION BY RELIEF CORPS.
Ccmmander Norton Counsels the
Burying of the Hatchet and
Future Unity.
OAKLASD OFTICK SanFrASCISCO CALL,)
908 Broadway, July 8. |
Lyon Post is again a portion of the
G. A. R., Department of California and
Commander E. A. Morton of Lyon Post, Whose Ninety Days' Suspension Has
Terminated.
[From a photograph by Bushnell, Oakland,]
Nevada. The suspension of its charter
for ninety days iapsed at midnight of
Monday and last night there was a re
union.
The first meeting of the post after sus
pension was not one of unalloyed satisfac
tion. There was a vacant chair and the
members all felt regretful that they had
not met as when they were forced to dis
continue meeting as a post.
Ninety days ago, when the suspension
went into effect, Comrade Charles B.
Kimball was in the full vigor of life. He
was an active member of Lyon Post and
keenly felt the humiliation of the suspen
sion. On Decoration day the post went to
the cemetery early in the morning and
heid their individual exercises. They were
prohibited from appearing as a funda
mental part of the department in the pro
cession and decorated alone. Comrade
Kimball was of the number that went to
the cemetery. He never missed aG. A. R.
funeral and was one of the most frequent
in attendance at tbe meetings.
Two weeks ago Comrade Kimball
grounded his arms and next year his
grave will be decorated by those of his
comrades who remain. At last night's re
union much reeret was expressed that
their comrade had died while the post was
under suspension so that bis brother
members could not attend officially and
pay the final honors as they desired.
Comrade Norton presided last night
over a very large gathering. His chair
was draped with the American flag which
was presented to Lyon Post by the Relief
Corps. There was a general hand-shaking
and exchange of greetings.
About a hundred members were present,
and several Â«hort speeches were made by
Comrades Goldsby, Talcott, Norton and
others. The susoension of the post seems
to have cemented the members more sol
idly together in fraternal feeling.
Comrade Norton made a short address
in which he counseled the burying of the
hatchet and standing shoulder to shoulder
as in the past.
A cordial invitation was received from
Lyon Relief Corps No. 6, W. R. C, to at
tend a reception to be given by the co ds
to the post on Tuesday evening next.
This date will be the twelfth anniversary
of the organization of the corp*. This
auxiliary has stood loyally by Lyon Post
during the dark days of its suspension,
and is the first to welcome them back to
the fold.
CONSUL GALLEGQS' DEATH
Came Suddenly as the Costa
Rica Representative Was
Walking.
Heart Diseas tbe Cd useâ Difficulty
Between the Two Local Repub
lican Clubs Adjusted.
BERKELEY, Cal., July B.â Senor
Kafael Gallegos, who has been Consul-
General to ban Francisco from Costa Rica
for the past five years, died suddenly tnis
morning on Shattuck avenue while walk-
Ing to the station.
The cause of I is sudden and wholly un
expected death was heart disease. The
Consul had been in poor health for some
time j.ast, but was wholly unaware of his
impending demise.
He has been able, however, to attend
to his official duties at bis office in
San Franci-co notwithstanding his condi
tion. He passed a good night last night,
ate a hearty breakfast this morning and
left for the local. He was somewhat de
pressed, however, on account of the de
parture 01 two of his daughters to the
country on their outing. Walking along
Shattuck avenue he was seen to stagger
upon the sidewalk for a considerable dis
j tance, but before be could be reached fell
to the pavement in a swoon. He was
lifted up and assisted for some distance,
when a wagon drove alone and took him
to a corner drugstore. A physician was
called, but his services were of no avail, as
the Consul was too near death, and soon
expired.
Senor Gallejros was 65 years of age and a
native of Costa Rica, but a resident of the
Lnited States for over twenty-five years,
four years of which have been spent in
Berkeley. He leaves a large family, hav
ing five grown daughters and two sons, one
of whom s in the employ of the Canadian
Insurance Company. An inquest was held
over the remains this afternoon, with the
verdict of heart disease.
The funeral will take ulace from St.
Joseph's Church in Berkeley next Friday
moraine at 10 o'clock. Interment in
Calvary Cemetery, San Francisco.
Peace in the Camp.
BERKELEY, Cal., July B.â The Mc-
Kinley Leauue at their meeting last night
took measures as a body to patch up tbe
slight breach recently caused between
their organization and the Edgar Repub
lican Club, by some of the individual
members of the two political organiza
tions. They passed a set of resolutions
embodying the general sentiment of the
club as regards the organization of which
Robert Edgar is the head, and in them it
was stated that no inharmony was exist
ant, and that they 3tood ready to co
operate with all Republican organizations.
Considerable friction had arisen between
the two clubs as a result of the stand
taken against the Edgar Club by J. W.
Striker of the McKinley League, who de
clared that the former had no right to ex
ist as a representative Republican organi
zation, since their existence had not been
recognized by the State Central Com mi t-
tee. Members of the Edgar Club, Captain
Morrison in particular, took up the fight,
and thus relations between certain mem
bers of the two clubs were getting to be
much strained. Before the matter had
gone too far the McKinley League steps
in and passes resolutions declaring for har
mony and co-operation.
It ?eems that the Edgar Club was formed
several weeks ago as a permanent Repub
lican organization, with the view to con
tinuing on in their party work even after
the coming Presidential election, while
tbe McKinley League was formed for tbe
campaign reason only. The latter re
ceived recognition from the State Central
Committee, while the former did not, and
around this point Centered the whole dif
ficulty.
The election of Robert McClain as presi
dent of the league was confirmed, and the
following additional officers elected : First
vice-president, Dr. Hubert N. Rowell ;
second vice-president, W. B. Winn; treas
urer, Harry Squires; sergeant-at-arms,
George Moore.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1896.
DISAPPEARANCE OF
A YOUNG WIFE,
Friends Fear Grief May
Hay Have Unhinged
Her Reason.
HER HUSBAND MISSING.
Mrs Daniels Was Distracted by
the Thought That She
Was Deserted.
MAY HAVE ENDED HEX LIFE.
Another Chapter to the Mystery That
Is Agitating North Oak
land.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, July 8. )
Mrs. Daniels of 588 Thirty-third street
is missing and her numerous friends and
neignbors are as anxious to hear of the
young wife as she herself was to hear of
her husband, who suddenly disappeared
over a month ago. It is feared that she
has been overcome by her grief and has
made away with herself.
When Mr. Daniels disappeared his wife
was destitute and it was feared by her
friends that her reason would give way.
She paced to and fro in tbeir beautifully
furnished home, and when week succeeded
week and nothing was heard of her hus
band she confided to a friend that she
feared she would never see Mr. Daniels
again.
The Daniels moved to their home about
nine months ago. He always bad money,
which he spent lavishly, and it was stated
that he was a mining man. He and his
wife made but few friends. She was a
very handsome woman and the young
couple attracted general attention.
About a month ago Daniels left home
suddenly and told bis wife he was going
to Liverpool, Eng., for the benefit of his
health. He left home and has not since
been heard from. Telegrams have brought
no news, and now his wife has dropped
completely out of sight.
For several days before disappearing
Mrs. Daniels was bordering an hysterics,
and was cared for by neighbors.
"When he first spoke of going off,' 1 said
Mrs. Daniels, "I intended to go with him,
but he was in toe much haste to allow of
my prepari ng for such a journey. When
be left me I had but 80 cents in my purse,
and he was to send me money in a couple
of days. He was to have written to me
from various places, but I have not re
ceived any money or any letter. He used
io deal in stocks, and was always well sup
plied with money, and I never Knew what
it was to be short. Our married life has
always been happy and pleasant, and I
fear that my nusband must have been
taken sick, or met with some accident. He
was very jolly when he left, and I expected
to receive letters from him all along the
route of his journey. The steamer on
which he was to have crossed the Atlantic
has arrived at Liverpool and he was not a
passenger."
It is about two weeks since Mrs. Dan
iels spoke as above to a Call reporter and
the continued strain told heavily upon her.
"For a few days before leaving," said an
intimate friend to-day, "Mrs. Daniels
feared she had been deserted and she be
came very despondent. She cried most of
the time and frequently said that she had
no desire to live without her husband,
who had always been kind to her. I fear
that her grief has turned her reason and
that the poor creature has done something
rash. She was of a proud, impetuous na
ture and it was heartbreaking to her to
have to depend on the charity of her
neighbors for her daily bread. No one
aeemed to know where they came from or
to know anything about their relatives.
He seemed to be a perfect gentleman and
they were a devoted couple. She was
quite young and of too lively a disposition
to bear up long under deep sorrow. I fear
she has done something desperate."
UNREQUIIED AFFECTION
Causes a Sixteen- Year-Old Girl
to Swallow Toothache
Drops.
A Public Meeting to Be Heid to Con
sider Principal Trne's Removal
by tbe Education Board.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July B.â Unrequited
love and blighted affections made Miss
Jennie Carlston of 529 Taylor avenue
despondent last night. She did not want
to live in this world any longer, and hav
ing got that thought into her silly 16-year
old head she visited the West End Drug
store at 9 o'clock. The drug clerk, Horace
B. Meader, sold her eorue three drahms
of chloroform and cocaine. The combina
tion known as toothache drops was for her
sister, so Miss Jennie said, and the drug
clerk took the precaution to label the
bottle with a poison label with its accom
panying skull and crossboues.
The symbol had no terror for Miss
Carlston. She retired to her bedroom,
uncorked the phial and poured the
contents down her tbroat to relieve her
heartache.
One of her sisters a short time afterward
found ber in an unconscious state ana
gave the alarm. Drs. Morgan and Lub
pock were railed in at once an :l after work
ing for three hours with her they finally
restored her to consciousness and placed
ber ont of immediate danger.
The gay deceiver's name is Hugh, and
be is a Ban Franciscan. It was Teamed
after ber desperate act that she bad writ
ten to Dim to meet her last night, and
that she kept tryst at the corner of Santa
Ciara avenne and Webster street until her
patience was exhausted. The relatives of
the girl are disinclined to discus* the oc
currence, but she divulged to them that
she had been deceived and had lavished
ber young affections on one who ill re
quited them.
Miss Jennie is a smart young woman,
rather prepossessing, and, so far as the
neighbors know, had a happy home.
They declare her rash act was the result of
morbid brooding over her cross in love
Her ravings made it evident that this
subject was uppermost in her mind for, as
she was brought round, she made touch
ing appeals to her mother for her lorgive
ness.
A Formidable Petition.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July B.âA lengthy
petition is being circulated, addressed 10
the Board of Education. It prays lor the
reinstatement of Principal C. If. True to
the Wilson School. It also condemns the
board's arbitrary action in dispensing with
his services, and states that he has shown
himself to be an able, progressive and
conscientious teacher. In the event of the
board refusing to reinstate Mr. True the
petitioners ask for a valid reason for the
denial of the request. A public meeting
is to be held on the 20th inst. to consider
the question and appoint a committee to
wait on the board. It is claimed that 95
per cent of those having children attend
ing the school are in favor of Mr. True's
reinstatement.
A Rumored Resignation.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July B.â Rumor has
it that Rev. W. M. Lane, rector of Christ
Episcopal Church, intends to resign. The
reverend gentleman is suffering from se
vere clergyman's sore throat, and leave of
absence has been granted him until Au
gust 1.
Senior Warden Smith says he has beard
of the rumors, but the only thing to make
Rev. Mr. Lane resign would be that the
climate is not conducive to his health.

then reported the fact to the Board.
Either tbe Board or printers would have

STELLA'S FATHER
QUITE SATISFIED,
Says Rev. Marshall Law
Acted Like a True
Friend.
BAKER FEARS HIS WIFE.
Since Reading a Sensational
Story Her Mind Has
Been Aff.cted.
REMARKABLY BRIGHT GIRL.
She Tells Her Own Story and Speaks
Highly of Her Late
Pastor.
Oakland Office Sajt Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, July 8. f
E. M. Baker, the father of Stella Baker,
made a statement to-day that thoroughly
exonerates Rev. Marshall Law from the
insinuations made by Mrs. Baker.
"Rev. Marshall Law did just what was
right," said the girl's father to-day. "He
saw that Estelle was not receiving proper
attention and was roaming around the
streets and he tried to do all in his power
to see that she was placed where she could
be looked after. This is a very grave mat
ter and may yet end in a tragedy. I am
afraid of Mrs. Baker, as I am sure she is
not responsible and la daily getting worse.
Stella denies ever saying a word about the
pastor of tbe Church of the Advent except
that he was interested in her welfare.
''Mr. Law told me tbat he bad discov
ered that Stella is a very intelligent girl.
She can sing and play music at sight and
is a good writer. He took her into bis
choir for the purpose of encouraging her,
and she left two months ago. Her mother
ia subject to halucinations and she has
imagined all she has said about Stella. I
live iv fear of her mother. When that
woman murdered herself and two chil
dren in San Francisco some months ago
Mrs. Baker was greatly affected by read
ing the news ana has frequently spoken
since of suicide as the only remedy for
human sorrows.
"There is no conspiracy to take Estella
away from her. The girl has already be
come wayward and needs a guardian. She
tells me that her mother has been cruel to
her and that she used to beat her and pay
no attention to her. She has threatened
to kill us all and this morning my son
who works at my shop in San Francisco
told me he was afraid his mother would
kill me."
Stella is at present staying with a pri
vate family in East Oakland awaiting the
ontcomeof the case.
"I have run away from my mother
twice," said the girl, "but it was because
she did not treat me right. Once I went
to my father and another time I went to
Mrs. Jfrescott of the Children's Society
and she sent me to the Chabot Home. My
mother says that I once asked a man for
money who was a stranger to me. I was
on my way to Good Friday services at Mr.
Laws' church. One of my knees gave out
and I asked a gentleman who was driving
to give me a riae. He took me a part of
the way and then gave me 10 cents with
which to complete my journey. That is
all there is to it."
Both sides are makice sensational
charges and when tbe case comes to trial
something tragic may be expected.

The august body of theologians that

of holding the examination.
While the questions were being asked
Mr. Bailey some of his flock thought that
the interrogators were too severe. A few
hints to this effect were dropped, but ttia
questions did not appear to be any easier.
There Is a young man who is a pillar of

were mainly suggested by Mr. Bailey's
equivocal answers. Mr. Russell evidently
thought that we were there to sanction
anything he wanted. We regard the ex
amination of a minister as a very serious
affair, and we do not appreciate inter
ference. After the examination we
passed Mr. Bailey, and he is now a full
fledged minister."
Hopeless Case of Insanity.
OAKLAND, Cal., July B.â Mrs. Annie
E. Tillman of Pleasanton was committed
to Agnews this afternoon. Her husband
is the proprietor of the Rose Hotel in that
town.
She has refused food for five days, tried
to kill ber baby and believes tbat the dead

has been treated at a private asylum for
some time, but her friends are afraid that
the case is hopeless.
Practicing Without a License.
OAKLAND, Cal., July B.â Mrs. M. Hy
land swore to a warrant to-day charging
one Broker with practicing medicine
without 4 license. She alleges that he
represented that he could cure ber of cer
tain ailments, and accepted pay for his
services.
This is the second case of its kind in
this city within a year. Dr. Ambrosque,
a Russian, was fined on a like charge, and
appealed it to the Superior Court and was
held liable, and finally paid his fine.
No Warrant Yet.
OAKLAND, Cal., July B.â Winnie A.
Stedman, who charged Harry de May with
betraying her under a promise of mar
riage, has not yet sworn out a warrant for
his arrest.
De May is out on bail. His case was
called for the second time in the folice
Court this morning. No warrant appear
ing, his attorney asked fora dismissal. As
Miss Stedman is unable to leave her
room, the case went over until to-mor
row.
FOR THE TIDAL CANAL
A Delegation of County and
City Officials to Visit
Colonel Suter.
Will Ask That Seventy-Five Thou
sand Dollars Be Expended on
Oakland Harbor.
Oakland Office Ban Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway. July 8. \
A large delegation of officials from Oak
land and Alameda will call upon Govern
ment Engineer Suter at his office in San
Francisco next Saturday morning. The
party will consist of Councilman Dam
and Capell, Drs. Beckwith and Chamber
lain of the Board of Health, Supervisors
Talcott and Church. Mayor Davie, City
Attorney Piersol, City Engineer Wilson
and Health Officer Dr. Bradley, all of
Oakland, and Health Officer McLean,
Trustees Leydecker and Fletter, Dr. Lub
bock and Dr. Bull of the Board of Health,
W. A. Knowles and J. B. Lanktree of the
Board of Education, City Engineer W. R.
Payzer, City Attorney* Taylor and City
Clerk Lamborn, all of Alameda.
The delegation is going in the interest
of harbor improvement. It desires to
have tbe canal finished at once, us recom
mended years ago by commissioners who
examined the project. It will require
about $75,000 to do this, but the report of
the above mentioned commissioners says
that the opening of tbe tidal canal and
the placing of flood gates there will do
more to keep the harbor in condition than
a whole force of dredgers. They recom
mended that this work be done and then
to let nature do the dredging for a year or
two. The committee wants that work
done now.
Now that the work is on the continual
contract list all that is necessary is for the
engineer in charge to ask for the amount
of money that he wants to use on the
work. It is the desire of this delegation
of city and county officials to have
Colonel Suter make the above recom
mendation to his superiors.

BUILDING ASSOCIATION SUIT.
The Suicide of Louis Blank Recalled by
the Testimony.
The case of the Security Loan Associa
tion against Mrs. Josephine J. Pritchard
is being heard in Judge Slack's court.
The case recalls the suicide of Louis
Blank, who swindled so many of the
building and loan companies a short time
ago.
The Security Loan Association is suing
Mrs. Pritchard for a balance due on a loan
of $4200. Mrs. Pritchard's husband, who
is now dead, borrowed that amount from
the association and took twenty-one and a
half shares of its stock, which he was to
pay up in weekly installments. He paid
$1182. which the association acknowledges
haying received, and his wife claims he
paid $1669, which Blank received and did
not account for.
The association is ready to acknowledge
that Blank may have received and not ac
counted for this money, but claims that he
in his will left to Mrs. Pritchard an
amount which offsets what' he appro
priated. On the other hand Mrs. Pritchard.
says that was simply a legacy and had
nothing to do with the business of the
Security Loan Association.
Mrs. Pritchard was on the stand nearly
all of yesterday afternoon and the matter
is not yet settled.

EQUAL SUFFRAGE
AND ITS FRIENDS.
Precinct Clubs Are Being
Organized in the
Interior.
MUCH INTEREST RIFE.
The Good Work Is Progressing
Admirably in Alameda
County.
ENTHUSIASM HERE IN TOWN.
Adherents of the Movement Appear to
Be ThoroOily Confident of
Victory.
"Woman suffrage is a serious matter
nowadays," remarked Miss Bay, chair
man of the State Central Committee of
the "Woman Suffrage Association, yester
day afternoon. The chairman, since she
cannot be called a chair-lady, was seated
at her desk endeavoring to get about two
bushels of letters into some sort of order,
and apparently meeting with only indif
ferent success in the effort.
"The volume of correspondence which
passes through this office," she went on,
"is something incredible. From tne let
ters one can easily see that the cause is
gaining ground all over tbe State. Women
write to us on all subjects, even remotely,
related to the suffrage movement. For
instance, I have seen a few letters con
taining complaints that the terms used by
the newspapers in referring to the suf
fraei3t claims were too flippant. Of course
these letters come from persons who do
not recollect that any one who ventures
into the field of politics is almost sure to
be 'guyed' unmercifully, sooner or later.
"I am bound to say, however, that de
spite some little gayety of phraseology
the local papers have as a rule treated us
kindly and respectfully.
"Of course, from The Call we have
learned to expect nothing but words of
cheer and encouragement. I could not
begin to number the families which to my
certain knowledge have ceased taking the
other papers in favor of The Call since
that great paper came out in straight
forward advocacy of woman suffrage.
Members of the Suffrage Association and
other friends of the movement look to
The Call for the most reliable informa
tion on the subject, appearing to regard
that journal as in a certain sense the
organ of the cause.
"But we are working as well as talk
ing," continued Miss Hay vivaciously. ''In
Madera County we have Mrs. Ida C. Haz
lett, late of Colorado, who is busy organiz
ing precinct clubs in the interior towns of
Southern and Central California. She is
aided by a corps of devoted lady assistants,
all of whom report that wherever they go
they tind crowds of enthusiastic, hard
working and high-minded women anxious
to work for the cause. In many instances
these women are obliged to travel long
distances in order to attend the meetings.
"Here in town, despite the season, much
interest is perceptible. At yesterday's
meeting of tbe Thirty-second Assembly
District Woman Suffrage Club the ladies
displayed thÂ«Â» most vivid appreciation of
the ends had in view by the movement
and evinced a determination to work un
flaggingly for its success. Miss Harriet
Mills delivered a stirring address, which
was frequently interrupted by applause,
and several committees were appointed to
see that the good work shall go on until
its grand object shalJ have been realized.
"On Tuesday afternoon we had a grand
meeting in Oakland. All the leading
spirits of the movement who reside in
Alameda County were present in force.
Mrs. A. A. Sargent, Mrs. Nellie Holbrook-
Blinn and I addressed the meeting on the
subject of precinct organization. The as
sembly was of one mind on the matter,
and steps are being taken for tbe organiza
tion of a well-ordered and comprehensive
plan of campaign throughout the county.
Meanwhile the Political Equality Club of
Alameda County has gotten out this little
leaflet, of which thousands of copies are
being circulated."
The leaflet, neatly printed on hot
pressed white paper, reads as follows :
The policy of the State Woman's Suffrage
Association Is non-partisan. The platform is
woman suffrage and our efforts will be concen
trated uf.on trying to carry the eleventh
amendment to the State constitution, which,
if it receive a majority of votes at the election
in NovemDer, 1896, will suffrage to
lvomea upon equal terms with men.
We base our claim to enfranchisement upon
right and justice, and believe that woman
suffrage is but carrying the principles of thi6
Republic to their logical conclusion.
We hold thet the interests of men and
women are not divided, but identical, and ask
for a fair-minded consideration of the amend
ment by all voters. After having tried until
election day to convince them of the right of
woman to self-government we shall submit
our case to their sense of right and justice
"So you can see," concluded Miss Hay,
with a despairing glance at the pile of let
ters before her, "that the suffrage move
ment is neither dead nor dying; that it is
very much alive ana that it is much too
important an affair to be lightly put off
as undeserving of serious consideration."
THE WIND DID IT.
Patrick Sullivan, Charged With Petty
.Larceny, Makes an Ingenious
Defense.
Patrick Sullivan, according to Judge
Conlan, is the boss prevaricator of the sea
son and is possessed of more nerve than
any prisoner that has come before him.
Sullivan was arrested last Thursday aft
ernoon in front of Nathan Lowenstein's
store, 901)4 Folsom street, on the charge
of petty larceny. He had stolen a rug
from a bupjry that was standing in front
of the store. It was found under his arm.
Two passers-by at the time, who saw
Sullivan Meal the mg, gave their evidence
and the arresting officers testified to find
ing the rue under Sullivan's arm.
"VVnat Lave you got to i-ay tor your
self ?" iraid the Judge, addressing the de
fendant.
"Well, you see," said the prisoner, "it was
just this way : I was walking past the
buggy and the wind was blowing strong,
and although you may not believe it the
wind lifted the rug out of the buegy and
it fell into my arms. Before I could re
turn it to the buggy I was arrested; and
that's tbe truth, your Honor.' 1
"Have you any witnesses?" asked the
court.
"None, except you take the wind," re
plied the defendant, with a grin.
"You will appear for sentence to-mor
row morning, retorted the Judge, and
Sullivan was led back to prison.

Tbe temporary order obtained some weeks
ago by Assistant United States Attorney Knight
restraining Treinore Coffee and William Wood
burn from disposing of certain property se
cured by them from James Henoy, now serving
a term of five years for robbing the Carson
City mint, came Jiefore Judge McKenna for
final disposition yesterday. In the argument
defendants' counsel raided tbe point us to the
court's jurisdiction, which brought out sucn a
flood of legal lore that Judge McKenna decided
to take the matter under advisement. Attorney
Knight suggested, however, that the order be
so modified as t6 permit the sale of the dis
puted property, provided the defendants would
deposit tbe proceeds with T. J. Edwards, olerk
of the Circuit Court of Nevada, pending l.tiga
tion in the Nevada courts. This was agreed to
by the defendants' counsel. The Government
will new institute suit in the Nevada Circuit
court to test the validity of the transfer by
Heney to the defendants.

PENCIL DEEDS
AND WILL GENUINE,
James G. Fair in Person Ac
knowledged Themâ So
Says Notary Public
Cooney.
THE EVIDENCE OF THE
OPPONENTS.
Richard Dey, Governor Budd,
Charles Fair, George Knight
and R. H. Lloyd Declare
Them Genuine.
MBS. NETTIE B, CRAVEN IS
STILL ILL.
Hearing in the Celebrated Case in Which
Millions Are Involved to Be Re
sumed Before Jndge Slack
This Morning.
James J. Cooney, the one-time notary
public who took the acknowledgment of
James G. Fair to the deeds of two pieces
of property "in favor of Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven, was yesterday served with a sub
pena calling him into court that he may
tell all about it.
The matter is to be heard before Judge
Slack at 11 o'clock this morning.
Mrs. Craven will not be in court as she
is very ill and under the constant attend
ance of physicians who forbid her leaving
her bed. One of these will be present to
make a statement to the court. If George
Knight still insists on adjourning rather
than breaking in upon the testimony of
Mrs. Craven by some other witness therr.
the other side," which comes forward in the
same matter with an independent pro
ceeding, will take the stage so that there
will not likely be a postponement.
There are, however, several other wit
nesses who have been summoned in the
same matter and who are enjoying very
good healtn and could occupy the time
quite profitably, no doubt, if they are per
mitted to do so. There is, for instance,
George R. Williams, who knows much
about Mrs. Craven' 4 * affairs, having been
her attornr y. There is also Mr. Roberts,
who has a lot of information about teie
u'rams that passed between himself atad
Mrs. Craven in cipher.
Then, on the other hand, there is Rich
ard V. Dey. who has a contract in writing
entered into by the heirs under the will
by which they bind themselves to pay to
Mrs. Craven $500,000 if she will forfeitber !
claims to all the property deeded to her by
Mr. Fair. It would be an interesting
story that he might tell.
Then there is James J. Cooney. as re
ferred to, who might tell about the taking
of the acknowledgment before him â how j
it was made by Mr. Pair in person.
Mr. Cooney does not hesitate to say so 1
to questions out of court and to say that j
be will be willing to tell all about "it in
court. He declares that he remembers
the circumstances of the taking of the
acknowledgemnt very well. It was all
a very ordinary and commonplace matter
and had not the slightest tincture of any
thing irregular or even unusual about it,
he says.
"James G. Fair in his own person
brought the deeds to me that I might cer
tify to the signatures," said Mr. Cooney
yesterday. "I knew Mr. Fair personally
and there could be no shadow of doubt
about it â Mr. Fair made the acknowledg
ment to me in person
"My office was in tne Lick House block,
and it was most nat nra l, because conven
ient, that Mr. Fair fl houid come to me. I
made no note of the transaction other
than the usual entry, as in other cases. I
was only interested in the signatures, and
these, upon the presentation of Mr. Fair,
I certified to as genuine. I made no note, j
that I remember, as to whether the deeds j
were in ink or in pencil, as it did not affect i
their legality in any way."
The testimony of the attorneys for '
Charles L. Fair, who have been summoned I
by the attorneys for Mrs. Craven, will be |
most interesting in view of their previous
utterances on the subject of the pencil j
will. It will not De forgotten that those |
who are now in opposition to the pencil
will were the parties who first brought it
forward and swore to its genuineness.
On the 18th day of March, 1895, the three
children of James G. Fair hied a petition
for the probate of the pencil will dated
September 24, 1894, alleging that the docu- j
ment was wholly in the handwriting of j
their father. In their petition they said: '
That said deceased left a last will and testa- I
ment, made, executed and dated on the 24th !
day of September, 1894, which was entirely j
written, dated and sigued by the hand of the !
fcald James G. Fair himself, and which will has
lately come into the possession of your pe
titioners, and they now deliver it to this hon
orable court, which haa jurisdiction over the
estate of said deceased.
Their prayer to this petition was as fol
lows:
Therefore your petitioners pray that said
will may bt admitted to probate as the last
will and testament of said James G. Fair.
The petition was sicned iv person by
the children of James G. Fair and their
many attorneys, as follows:
C. L. Fair, Theresa Alice Oelrlchs, VirKinia
Fair, Knight <fe Heggerty, attorneys for C. L.
-Fair; Lloyd Â«fc Woods, attorneys for T. A. Oel
richs and Virginia Fair; Garber, Boalt &
Bishop and Wilson & Wilson of counsel for C.
L. Fair, Theresa Oelrichs and Virginia Fair.
Touching the genuineness of this docu
ment, which they asked the court to ad
mit to probate as the last will and testa
ment of James G. Fair, deceased, there
were several interviews in the press with
the gentlemen who are now attacking the
instrument. In one of these Reuben H.
Lloyd is reported as saying:
The three children have joined In a petition

for the probate of this will and they are a unit
in their judgment that it is genuine. The
girls recognize the handwriting and the signa
tures tud have no hesitancy in declaring it
Pennine. Fair wrote frequently with pencil.
We have compared this will with no end of
his handwriting and the resemblance is
throughout. The will bears inherent evidence
of its genuineness, even if the proof of its ex
istence and signing were not so overwhelming.
We have felt right along that a later will,
written by the Senator himself, was iv exist
ence, but we did not know in whose custody it
had been left and feared that it might be in
the vault iv the Fair building.
George A. Knight said :
The accusation that the will is a forgery is
absurd. Its history is a little peculiar, but no
one should think for a moment that reputable
attorneys would introduce it into court until
they had become thoroughly convinced that it
was genuine. The names of the attorneys
fathering the will ought to have considerable
weight Garber, Boalt & Bishop, Lloyd &.
Wood, Wilson & Wilson and my partner, Mr.
Heggerty, and myself would never sanction a
forgeiy. We investigated it thoroughly before
we became satisfied that it was genuine, and
we feel confident that it is.
Richard Dey, who was Senator Fair's
private secretary for many years, was con
fident that the will of September 24 was
genafeie. In an interview published in
The Call on March 20. 1895, he said :
The handwriting of the will is most as
suredly tnat of the late Mr. Fair,
and I don't hesitate to pronounce the will
genuiTie in every respect. I should be lamiliar
I with Senator Fair's handwriting ii anybody is.
I was his secretary from, let me see; anyway,
it was in the '60's, uutil 1884. I understood
him thoroughly. We consulted together,
dined together, traveled together.
There is no doubt in my mind but that the
new document expresses the manner in which
the late Senator wished to dispose of his
estate. It was just like him to write this new
will. 11 was hiswavof doing things. He al
lowed these executors (the executors of the
first will filed) to thinfc that they had every
thing their own way, and then he went ofi'and
upset the whole matter by writing another
wilL Nothing could be more characteristic of
the man.
Charles L. Fair said :
I think I ought to know my father's hand
writing. And this talk about the will being a
forgery is absurd.
Governor Budd, who is also an attorney
for Charles Fair, being interviewed said he
had thorough confidence in the authen
ticity of the will and scouted the idea of
it being a forgery. He has not in any pub
lic utterance shown any disposition to this
day to do so.
After the will of September 24 had
been presented to the court as before
stated its probate was contested by some
of the collateral relatives and by young
Herman Oelrichs by Van R. Paterson,
their attorney, appointed by the
court. This contest was upon the grounds
that the instrument was not the last will
of James G. Fair, and that it was a for
gery. To ibis contest Charles L. Fair,
Theresa A. Oelrichs and Virginia Fair an
swered on April 26, 1895. The answer
was as follows:
These defendants deny that the said will,
dated September 24, 1894, is not the last will
or any will of James G. Pair, and deny that the
said will, dated the 24th day of September,
1894, was not or that any part of it was not
written by the said James G. Fair, or
that it was never signed or dated by
him or by him executed in any manner
whatever, but on the contrary these defendants
averfthat the said will, dated the 124 th day of
September, 1894. is the last will and testament
of said James G. Fair, decensed, and that thf>
same was wholly written, dated, signed ajid
executed by him, and was so written, dated,
signed and executed by him as and for his
last will.
Defendants deny that the said James G. Fair
did not make, sign, publish and declare said
writing, dated September 24. 1894, to be his
la^t will, but 011 the contrary these defendants i
aver that the said James G. Fair made, signed,
published and declared said writing, dated the j
24th day of September. 1894, to be his lnst
will, and that said writing was by him in- j
tended so to be.
This answer was signed by Knight &
Heggerty, attorneys for Defendant Charles
L. Fair; Lloyd <fe Wood, attorneys for De
fendants Theresa A. Oelrichs and Virginia
Fair, and by Garber, Boalt & Bishop and
W 7 ilson & Wilson of counsel.
So, as stated, it will be an interesting
hour or more, in which all these gentle
[ men try to reconcile these statements with
i their present position in opposition to the
1 pencil will and their declarations that the
j will and the deeds are forgeries.
MR. FORMHALS WENT OUT
Tiff in the Mechanics' Institute
Over the Recent Prize-
Fight.
J. N. Cummings Resigns as Trustee and
Is Elected Secretary Over Sev
eral Other Candidates.
There has been a row in the Board of
Trustees of the Mechanics' Institute.
The St. Louis convention had its Teller;
! the Baldwin Hotel had its disgruntled
j bellboys; and the series of bolts is not yet
jat an end. Last night Trustee Ferdinand
; Formhals threw down the gauntlet and
1 walked out of the trustees' meeting.
It was all an aftermath of the recent
â  Corbett-Sharkey hugging match in the
I Pavilion, and grew out of a discussion of
i the private arrangement made by Mr.
Forinnais for the rent of the building on
that occasion.
Before, when the Pavilion was rented
for one night and the arrangements re
quired a day or two, it was customary to
charge a half rate for each day so occu
-1 pled. Formhals did not exact "this extra
charge. The president of the National
! Club had put up the required guarantee to
cover damages to the property, had paid
I for the one night and had pocketed the
I balance after settling for incidental
! breakage. The trustees came to the con
clusion last night that no exception should
be made for prizefights, and Trustee P. J.
Healy lit the fuse that caused the explo
sion when he murmured:
"Mow are we to recover this |300? Is
there any way?"
"Certainly," tartly responded Trustee
Formhals.
"I move we take the proper steps then
at once," continued Healy.
"I sit in this board no more," shouted
the agitated Mr. Formbals as he made a
breaK for the door and then banged it
after him.
For a moment a dead silence followed,
and then from the maz#s of Director
Healy's auburn whiskers came soft music
as he hummed, "\ou can't lose me,
Charley." The directors smiled; and
from the other end of the long table Mr.
Ayers murmured:
"But the cat came back."
As the storm clouds disappeared Director
Healy got up again and submitted a reso
lution "that hereafter we charge persons
wishing to use the Pavilion for boxing
purposes $500 in gold coin, including the
day before and the day after the contest."
The resolution was carried.
A good deal of routine business was
done and preparations for the coming
Home Products Fair were discussed at
length.
The recent resignation of the secretary
lof the institute, who has accepted the
j principalship of Cogswell College, brought
out several candidates for the position,
which will become vacant on August 1.
The candidates were: Carl H. Clark, agent
for the prospective fair; J. H. Wood, an
employe of the Mechanics' Library for the
last ten years; Richard Ott, an insurance
I man, and Joseph N. Cummings, a trustee
of the Mechanics' Institute and the sec
retary of the board. Mr. Cumraings ten
dered his resignation for both these posi
tions in order that he might be a candi
date. His resignation was accepted, and
later he was unanimously elected secretary
of the Mechanics' Institute.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JULY 9, 1896.
DEMOCRATS GOING
TOWARD M'KINLEY.
Representative Men Dis
gusted With the Chi
cago Stand.
WATKINS, POND, BISHOP.
With Others They Are Out
spoken Against Silver as the
Single Issue.
WANT A SOIFND-MONEY PLANK.
Marcus Rosenthal Declares He Will
Certainly Vote for the Ohio
Favorite.
Although tho Democratic Convention
now in session at Chicago has not yet
adopted a platform or named a candidate,
the indications are conclusive that a strong
16 to 1 silver plank will be placed in the
declaration of principles of the party, and
that the Presidental nominee will have to
stand firnily on this platform.
Already many strong gold Democrats
are crying out against what they do not
hesitate to call the suicidal policy that has
been foreshadowed in the proceedings at
Chicago, ana some have gone so far as to
declare outright for McKinley, gold and
protection, while others, more partisan
and less patriotic, have announced their
intention of remaining passive during the
campaign, and of refraining from voting
at the election in November.
There is a promise that there will be a
large defection from the Democratic ranks
owing to the attitude of the party on the
financial question, and that the voting
strength of the Republicans will be aug
mented proportionally.
A. A. Watkins, formerly chairman of
the local Democratic committee of 450,
was outspoken against silver, its advo
cates and its evils, and broadly intimated
that events at Chicago might compel him
to cast his vote for the nominee of the Re
publican Convention, which is before the
country with a platform in favor of protec
tion and gold.
"The nomination of a free-silver-coinage
candidate at Chicago will simply mean
defeat for the Democratic party," he be
gan. "1 don't think it possible for the
Democratic or any other party to elect a
silver candidate or one favorable to the
free coinage of silver.
"I thinfc such a nomination on the part
of the Democratic Convention will drive a
great many Democrats into the ranks of
the Republican party. In my limited ar
quaintance I can count up twenty-five
stanch Democrats who have declared
that they will remain passive during the
campaign if they don't go over to the
other side.
"They can't carry on the campaign," he
added, "very effectively without tne
sinews of war, and they will not be forth
coming in this campaign as they have
been heretofore.
"I am of the opinion that the 300 gold
men will nominate a candidate on a gold
platform and that we will have a repeti
tion of 1860, when the Democrats split up
at Charleston, the Northern faction
naming Douglas and the Southern faction
Breckinridge. We will have two wings of
the Democratic party opposed to each
other, and the result will oe the election of
McKinley.
"I shall not vote for a Presidential can
didate on a platform indorsing the free
coinage of silver at any ratio. It is a
heresy, the same as was the greenback fad.
Many will remember Vallandingham and
Pendleton. They were prominent Demo
crats of Ohio, but they were buried in
their attempt to carry out a greenback
policy. Silver is a similar heresy that
will carry down politically those who ad
vocate it.
"I have never failed to vote for a Demo
crat all my life, and have always sup
ported the Democratic ticket, but the
party has changed so much that there is
now nothing left of Democracy but the
trademark.
"I shall not take any active part in the
campaign. One itronp principle of the
Democratic party has been its opposition
to class legislation, and most assuredly
the free coinage of silver as advocated is
claas legislation. .
"Many Democrats express themselves
similarly to what I have said, but they
don't like to leave the party; yet they
can't stay with it under the circum
stances."
"Shall yon vote for McKinley?" was
asked.
"I am not prepared at this time to say,
but circumstances may arise that might
compel me to do so. At present I can
only say that I have determined to remain
passive."
"I regard the declaration for silver at 16
to las a great misfortune to the party,"
said ex-Supervisor James Decman. "1
have done all I could, both in the conven
tion at Sacramento and elsewhere, to
avert what seems to me a disaster, but
we roust do the best we can. I have been
a Democrat forty-five years, and I certainly
shall not vote for McKinley.
"The people have gone wild over silver,
and there are comparatively few Demo
cratic gold votes. A number of Demo
crats will refuse to support silver, but there
will be more dispusted Republicans who
will not vote for gold. This silver ques
tion places the Democrats in a peculiar
position. Ti ey have been fighting against
the protective system, wnich makes richer
those already rich, and now they have to
choose between a high protective tariff and
free silver. Although many declare they
will not vote for any free-silver man,
nevertheless when the election day comes
I believe few will vote for McKinley.
"It looks to me," continued the ex-
Supervisor, lapsing into prophecy, "as
though Teller would be the nominee of
the convention, and I believe Teller could
be elected. The Populist vote will decide
the contest, and if the Democrats put up a
man who will draw the Populist vote the
Democratic nominee will be elected. The
Democratic and Republican parties have
long been pretty evenly matched, and the
2,000,000 Populist votes are sufficient to
turn the scale either way. If the Demo
crats put up Teller or even Bland they
will get the Populist vote and elect their
man. If they do not the Populists will
put up a man of their own, and that means
McKinley's election.

E. B. Pond declined to be â¢ interviewed
upon the present political situation when
seen last evening. "I do not believe it
would be quite in place to speak on the
subject at this time," ,he said. '.'When
some definite action shall have been taken
perhaps I shall have something to say.
Of course everybody knows I am a gold
man â at least I .am opposed to the free
coinage of silver at 16 to 1, and at the
proper time I shall express "myself on the
subject."
Thomas B. Bishop, the well-known at
torney, lately of the linn of Garber, Boalt
& Bishop, who has previously been a good
Democrat, has been converted to Repub
licanism, and declared . his . intention of
casting bis vote in the coming election for
McKinley and Hobart, because he thinks
that their election will insure the finan
cial and industrial prosperity of the coun
try. ;!gs fWMSMinfIsVnVBI
It is expected that this . change of heart
in Mr. Bishop will have its due influence
and that many others of his late party will
follow his example. Â«
Marcus Rosenthal. the well-known at
torney, while inclined to be cautious in
expressing his views before a . platform
had been adopted or a candidate named,
appeared to feel confident that silver
would be the slogan of his party.
"Should the convention name a candi
date, on a silver platform," he said, "I
shall â be : constrained to vote for Mr. Me-;
Kinley. Of course it would give me a great
deal of pain to be compelled to a ever my
connection with the Democratic party, but
lam confident that the adoption of free
coinage would be so damaging to the beat
interests of the country that I would have
to place patriotism tin this case before
party interests. .The i election of a ' Presi
dent on a silver platform would inevitably
bring on a great financial panic and
crash." _^^____ _ _
DROPPED DEAD IN CHURCH.

seen to fall from his chair to the floor.
The pastoi hurried toward the dying man

MRS, PERKINS VERY ILL
She Is Supposed to Have Taken
an Overdose of Some
Powerful Drug.
Fears for Her Life Were Felt at
Firstâ She Is Now Out of
Danger.
OAKLAND, Cal.. July B.â The wife of
George C. Perkins Jr. was taken seriously
ill this afternoon, and for a time it was
thought that she would die.
The family lives at Eleventh avenue and
East Twenty-ninth street, and many con
flicting stories are told by the servants
and neighbors concerning the circum
stances surrounding the sudden attack of
sickness.
Mrs. Perkins had just finished a light
meal which she had been eating with her
little boy when she cried out to a servant
to bring an emetic as she bad swallowed
something Dy mistake. She was very
much frightened and told the servant
that she thought she was dying.
The servant at once got into a buggy
and started out to find medical aid. While
she was absent Mrs. Perkins expressed
great fear that she was attacked with a
fatal disease and asked that her husband
and mother be sent for.
Dr. McCollough answered the summons
for aid and when he arrived Mrs. Perkins
was unconscious. He was soon afterward
joined by Dr. Sill and they worked over
the patient for two hours without any
effect.
It was stated that Mrs. Perkins had acci
dentally taken a big dose of laudanum.
After the first violent effects of the drug
bad been overcome the lady became hys
terical and had to be treated for several
hours. Till late this evening it was neces
sary to keep her moving to work off the
effects of the potion. There was no one
in the house at the time but the servants,
and they profess to be unable to account
for their mistress' sudden sickness, for no
one saw her take anything. One of them
stated that Mrs. Perkins had been elooruy
all morning and had not felt well.
Whatever were the circumstances there
is every effort made to keep the details of
the affair secret. Mrs. Perkins was out
driving about an hour before it happened
and a dealer named Vestal, who calls at
the house regularly, said that she looked
to De in particularly good spirits.
About an hour after being at the house
the servant passed him in the buggy and
told him her mistress was fatally sick.
Until late to-night Drs. McCullough and
Sill were in attendance on the sick woman.
When Mr. Perkins was asked to-night how
bis wife was progressing tie said that she
was all right and out of danger, but de
clined to say more.
It is believed that Mrs. Perkins was
taking some medicine and took an over
dose. It is reported that similar mis
takes have been made in the past.
As soon as they were notified of the ac
cident, Mr. Perkins Jr. ami Mrs. Quat
man, the wile's mother, arrived, but
neither would talk of the matter.
Mrs. Perkins was formerly Eva Quat
man. She married Senator Perkins' son a
few years aeo, and lived for a time on her
husband's ranch in the country. Recently
they moved to East Oakland. They have
a child about 4 years old.
At midnight Dr. Sill said that Mrs. Per
kins was conscious and out of danger.
