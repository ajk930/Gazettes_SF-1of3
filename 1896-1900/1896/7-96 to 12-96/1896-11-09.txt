PLANS OF SILVER MEN.
. Will Continue to Advocate Free Coinage
Despite the Industrial Awak
ening.
â¢WASHINGTON. D. C, Nov. B.âDirec
tors of the American Bimetallic Union,
who constitute the bulk of the silver lead
ers in three parties, have decided to main
tain Headquarters in this city and use it as
the agency through which literature is to
be spread broadcast over the land. The
branch office at Chicago will be consoli-
dated w ith the Washington office, but the
So-n Francisco branch is to be conttuued.
A. J. Warner, president of the uuion, at
the request of the directors bag issued the
following address setting forth the pur
poses of the silver men:
To the silver leagues and bimetallic unions
of the United States: silver has lost in this
election, but the battle for the overthrow of
the gold standard has not ended. The dis
astrous consequences that must aiUndupon
the continuance of this standard make it im-
possible to relinquish the struggle against it
until it is folly overthrown.
The geld standard caunot. be maintained by
increa*iÂ£g revenues, because revenues are not
paid in gold. The attempt to maintain the
gold standard by perpetual loans must also
sooner or later fail. Tije only other way is by
contracting the currency and forcing down
prices so low that gold will come here of itself
in such quantities as to constitute, ip part at
least, the currency with which revenues are
paid, and no debtor nation can long maintain
such a policy.
.Either course, therefore, leads to inevitable
ruinâ the one by bankrupting the Government
and the other by bankrupting the people.
Either policy will subject the United Stuies
absolutely to British dumiuatioii, aud hence
the rejoicing of the Br.tish press over the
deieat o: silver here.
The victory ul gold is a victory of trusts and
Bviidica;ed wealth, brought about by corrup
tion and coercion and not a victory by the
people for the peuple, and it cannot last.
There must be an end also to the constant ap
preciation of money. The appreciation of
money alone, ii allowed to go on at the rate
it has gone on for the past twenty years, will
in hall a generation more transfer the bulk of
all the wealth of this country from those who
have created it to the hands of the few who
control the money uud own the debts.
No power can be conceived so potent to gather
wealth into few hands us the ceaseless, all
â¢ prevuding power of an appreciating money
standard. No civilization can stand it. It
must end or the foundation upon which, free
institutions rest will be broken up.
T^e battle therefore ior. the restoration of
'silver must go ou nitnout abatement, and 1
urge upon all silver and bimetallic leagues
and unions to Keep up their organizations and
â hen continue the light till victory for the
people is final!}' won.
The noble iight made by our intrepid leader
In the campaign just ended endears him to all
who believe in the righteousness of our cause,
und under his leadership we believe victory
will be won in 1900.

Final Ilulleti* From Kentucky** Repub

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. B.â The Re
publican State Campaign Committee will
close up suop to-morrow. Chairman Rob
eits issued ms final bulletin this u.ter
. ' noon. It is as follow^:
â¢ Practically complete official returns give
'; McKinley 444 plurality iv Kentucky, unoffi
cial advices indicating that the four missing
counties will iixrease rather thfin decrease
these figures. The Kepublicans elect lour
members of Congress and a Judge of the high
est court of the State for an eight-year term,
and by the tilling of vacancies have secured a
majority of two in the General Assembly on
Joint ballot, winch insures the election of a
Republican successor to Senator Blackburn.
The total vole of the State will approach
425,000, an increase of 70,000 over last yeiir's
vote and 25.000 more than the hiche^t esti
mates before the election. The Republican
vole increased about 4000 over JBradley's vote
a year n^o, which was 17,000 higher than ever
â¢ before cast In a Presidential election. The
Democratic vote was U5,000 higher. These
tgures -will give some idea, of the intensity of
* the political struggle through wliich Ken
tucky lias just passed.
A Samiel J. Roberts, Chairman.
â  Mr. Roberts has sent congratulatory tel-
V"ami to Major McKinley and Mark
NHunua giving ti.e facts as to the final re
sult. When asKed about the probability
of the Democrats getting one electoral
vote Mr. Roberts stated that this could
not be ascertained until the official count
was made by the State canvassing board.
â¢ Governor Bradley, as a member of the
The san Francisco Call
State canvassing board, has sent the fol
lowing telegram to National Committee
man Scott of New York :
FRANKFORT, Kv., Xov. 6.â Kentucky has
certainly gone for McKiuley and .will just as
certainly be counted. W. O. Bradley.
Up to 10 o'clock 10-night the Courier-
Journal hud no new figures on the rpstilt
of the election in Kentucky, and McKiu
ley's plurality stands at 4SS, wit:: six
counties to be heard from only. Whether
or not the discrepancy botween the votes
for different electors on the same ticket
lias resulted in the choice of one Bryan
elector and twelve McKinley electors can
not be positively known until the State
canvassing board foots up the vote for
each elector. The Democratic leavers still
claim ttie State, but uoae of them Were in

STATUS OF THE SENATE.
Mirer Itmublican* Matt Held to the,
WiU of Ihrir Farty.
PROVIDENCE, 11. 1.. Nov. B.â ln an
interview last evening with a Journal re
ptrter Senator Nelson W. Aldnch gave it
as his opinion that the standing of the
two leading parties in the next Senate
would be very close. It is expected that
President-elect McKinley will call a spe
cial session of Congress to consider the
revenue question soon after inauguration.
The Senator lietirei that at the present
time only two States are doubtful â North
Carolina and South Dakota.
In the former the Legislature is fusion,
Republican and Populist, and in the latter
the Populists claim n majority.
As matters stand, the financial forces are
evenly divided in the Senate â forty-four
gold and the same number of silver.
These figures are likely to change, how
ever, for it is possible tbat some silver Re
publicans may accept the verdict of the
elections and accede to the St. Louis plat
form. Until the exact status of the Sen
ate is decided. Senator Aldnch will not
state his opinion concerning the future
course the party is likely to take in the
matter cf revenue legislation.
WNATS NO MORE AGITATION
Advice of a Free Silver Journal to Itry
ii i and Jlii Lieutenant*.
COLUMBUS, Ohio. Nov. B.â The Press
of this city, which was one of the most
enthusiastic supporters of free silver in
the late campaign, deprecates the deter
mination of the Western free silver men,
with Mr. Bryan at their head, to keep up
the agitation of the silver question. It
says:
No National election wiil take place for two
years. In 1898 a new Congress must be elected.
At that time we shall see whether the election
of MeKinley has brought permanent pros
perity. If It has, then nothing can overthrow
ttie Republican party at that time. If, on me
other hand, limes are stiil hard and getting
worse, that will demonstrate that his eiection
was a mistake, aud the people will elect a
Congress opposed to Mr. McKinley's adminis
tration. But for the present no aggressive op
position should be organiz-d which could in
any way tend to retard the revival of business
activity.

MUSKEGON, Mich., Nov. 8. â About
10:30 o'clock this morning the beach pa-^
trolman on the south shore of the harbor
reported wreckage coming ashore. This !
report brought to the mind of Captain
Wood the question of the safety of the
big three-masted schooner which arrived
off tne point about 4 o'clock yesterday
afternoon flying a tug flag as she came
into sight, and word was sent lor the Car
rie Ryerson, which came down, but did
not venture out in the face of the big sea
which wa-t running. The schooner was
apparently all right during the evening,
and at 9 o'clock the looKout man saw her
lights. After that they disappeared and \
nothing more was seen of them. It was i
thought that she had slipped her cables i
and run out to get room, but the sequel
shows she had not. En the storm, the
awful cold and darkness seven live 3 had
been lost.
The lookout man at the life-savinc sta
tion thought he saw something move on
a dark object which bobbed with the swell
of the sea about half a mile off the har
bor. This was at the break of day, and
Captain Wood was notified and speedily
found out that it was the wrecic of a ves

a sailor clineing to an improvised raft.
The man was hardly able to wave the life
preservers as they came up. He was taken
to the station, and when pronounced out
of danger was sent to bed.
This evening he wns able to teli that his
name was Frank Delach ; that they left
Turington Friday, and almost immedi
ately the captain began drinking, having
for his companions a sailor named Fred
and the mate. Soon the three became
drunk and they continued that way until
the end.
The boat leaked badly ail the way, and
the hands at the pumps soon became
worked out. The sea increased, and the
men begged the captain to beach the
boat, but nc refused. When they came in
sight, of Muskpgon he did not know where
he was, and anchored a mile and a half
out, against the protests of DeJach, who
wajited him to either enter the harbor or
go ashore. TbÂ« drunken captain, how
ever, refused, and would not allow any
signals to be given to bring help, locking
up tne torches. Shortly after the boat be
gan breaking up, and the men sought
safety in the rigginir. One by one the

This was Dslach's first trip on the boat

FUNERAL OF MRS. VANDERBILT.
Her Body Will Be Borne to the Tomb on
Tuesday â Cornelius Vanderbilt
Improving.
. NEW YORK, N. ST., Nov. B.â The funeral
of the laV-> Mrs. William 11. Vanderbilt is
to take j>lÂ£C2 Tuesday morning, arrange
ments having been perfected to-day alter
consulting with Cornelius Vanderbilt and
other members ot the family. The pall
bearers will be D. O. Mills, S. F. Barger,
Ciiauncey M. Depew, George Crocker, J.
A. Burden and John Sloane. Services
,wil! be held in St. Bartholomew's Church
of which Mrs. Vanderbilt was aya v member,
at 10 a. M., conducted by the rector, Rev.
David K. Greer. The remains will be
entombed at Dewdrop, Staten Island.
The health of Cornelius Vandorbilt is a
matter of solicitude at this time, because
of the shock of his mother's death coming
upon him while he was still confined to
his Newport home convalescing. Mr. De
pew said to-night that Mr. Vanderbilt had
stood the trip from Newport better than
might have been expected, and that be
was certainly getting along well. Most
Â«nen suffering from an attack as severe as
that sustained by Mr. Vanderbilt wou^d,
he thought, have been confined to the
house for six months and incapacitated
from business for a longer period. From
his remark?, it is evident Mr. Vanderbilt
is able to give some slight attention to
business matters, though still uuder the
care of his physician.

EUROPEAN DEADLOCK BROKEN.
The Powers Believed to Hive Reached
an Agreern nt 1o Act in
Unison
PARIS, France, Nov. B.â lt is evident
that the speech delivered in the Chamber
of Deputies by M. Hanotaux, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, has had an extraordinary
effect upon the Sultan of Turkey and has
produced results that the most sanguine
almost despaired of ever s-eing. The
statement cablt d last night by the United
Associated Presses as to the attitude of
the Sultan after he learned what M. Hano
taux had said, and the many reforms he
promised in consequence of the attitude
of France, was official, it having emanated
from the Foreign Office here. Seldom, il
ever, has partial fulfillment followed so
closely upon the Turkish promises, and it
is believed here that all reforms promised
by the Sultan will be carried out as quickiy
as circumstances will permit, particularly
as M. Cambon, the French Embassador to
the Porte, has received precise instruc
tions from the Foreign Office to watch the
application of the preliminary reform in
the Turkish administration.
As stated in last night's dispatches", the
Sultan, as soon as he received from the
Turkish Embassador here a telegraphic
report of M. Hanotaux's speech, sent one
of his secretaries to M. Cambon, who im
pressed upon the secretary that there was
urgent necessity for the Sultan to adopt
measures to reassure the public opinion
and satisfy Europe. The French repre
sentative spoke with no uncertain tone,
and the whole conversation was repeated
by the secretary to the Sultan, who ap
parently realized tbat the time for trifling
was past. At any rate the Turkish Em
bassador at Paris yesterday visited the
Foreign Office and informed M. Hanotaux
that the Saltan had decided upon effect
ing widespread and radical reforms.
Among the promises made by the Sultan
was one to dismiss the Vali of D.arbekir
for the share he took in the disorders
there, and this promise has already been
fulfilled. Khalid Bey, president of the
Criminal Court, will replace the dismissed
Vali.
Advices from Constantinople show it is

shows that tho European deadlock is
ended, and that the powers have finally
decided upon a joint plan of action.
The Daily News will express itself as
being skeptical of the reforms being car

Russia's active support.

dispatch from Vienna saying it is reported
there that France has obtained the assist
ance of Russia in a reorganization of the
TurKish finances on the basis of European
control. The dispatch notes that M,

Brutal Attack Upon an

in Cuba.

SEVENTEEN PACIFICOS SLAIN.
Murder of Unarmed Workingmen
Reported as a Decisive
Victory.
KEY WEST, Fla., Nov. B.â Passengers
who arrived last night from Havana
brought news of another outrage com
mitted on an American citizen. Although,
the details are incomplete the facts aro
positive, since the victim has filed a pro
test with Vice-Consul Springer and the
case has been sent to Washington for in
structions.
It appears that near the town of San
Jose de las La jus, this province, a Spanish
force patroling the country surprised
three rebels who tried to sneak into town.
The Spaniards gave chase and the rebels
fled. In order to discover the hiding
place of the fugitives the Spanish forces
were divided into squads of tilty ineu and
sent in diXferenl. directions.
One of these parties went to the estate
owned by a Cuban where Frederick L.
Craycraft, a native of Indiana and only
two years in Cuba, was manager. They
entered the residence, destroyed the fur
niture Â«nd ransacked the premises. The
women present were insulted in the most
outrageous manner. Craycraft protested
that he was an American and showed pa
pers. This seemed to incense the officer
iv command, who drew a sword and com
menced slashing at Craycraft. He man
aged to avert death, but was wounded in
the back, receiving a, fearful gash thct
carried away part of the ilesh. His fore
arm was also cut to the bone. The other
officers interfered and saved his life. Cray
craft was forced to deliver about $160 in
his possession.
Meantime Craycraft heard great oubÂ»
cries outside, and later found that seven
teen Pacilicos had been killed. There v,;t3
not one insurgent among them. All thia
was reported last week as a great Spanish,
victory.
Letters received from Puerto Principe
give further details of the capture of tho
town of Guoyamuro by Calixto Garcia.
The whole garrison, IGO men, surrendered
and are still pr.soners, although Garcia
sent word to Castellanos that he would
deliver them. Garcia is also attending to
the officers' and soldiers' wounds.
It is rumored that Weyler has issued
secret orders to military commanders in
the sugar districts prohibiting grinding,
except on Spanish properties. Orders
have also been issued to seize foreigners
residing on sugar estates, to kill cattie and
destroy implements and to simulate a
fight in order to scare the farmers and
laborers.
Passengers by the steamer Olivette re
port that numerous insurgents from the
command of General Gomez have entered
the province of Matanzas during the past
few days and have caused General WeyK-r
to dispatch 6000 of his troops stationed in
Pinar del Rio district into Matanzas.
Considerable excitement exists in Havana
ana al>o in Matanzas, the people fearing
an attack upon the latter placa.
WATCHING THE FILINUSTERS.
Mysterious Movement* of the Dntintlen*
an<i Three Friends.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Nov. B.â The
steamer Dauntless, seized by the collector
of customs at Fernandina for violating
navigation laws by not carrying a suffi
cient number of lifeboats, has, it is alleged
gone to Brunswick, Ga., to engage in the
towing business. The Government offi
cials are suspicious of the alleged filibus
ter and yesterday, as soon as the revenue
cutter Colfax arrived here in charge of
Captain Herrinsr, the cutter Boutwell at
once took on coal and started in pursuit
of the Dauntless.
In an hour after the Boutwell crossed
the bar the filibustering steamer Three
Friends left its dock and crossed the bar
alter dark. It had on board three weeks'
supply of coal. The Three Friends was
closely followed by the steamer Kate Spen
cer, which has several times carried out
cargoes of arms and ammunition for the
Three Friends. The United States crui-er
Raleigh has been ordered from Key West
to the St. Johns bar to watch for ul^us
teriug expeditions.

BISMARCK'S STRIFE
WITH THE KAISER
Prince Hohenlohe Seeks to
End the Disastrous
Feud.
The Chancellor's Health Im
paired by the Acuteness of
the Controversy.
M'KINLEY'3 POLICY DEBATED.
Hoped That His First Aim Will Bs
to Secure International
Bimetallism,
copy righted, 1896, by th 3 Cnlted Associated
I'resÃes.J
BERLIN, Germany, Nov. B.â A report
which gained general credence was in cir
culation last evening that the Emperor
had demanded that Prince Bismarck come
to Berlin for the purpose of engaging In a
conference with himself and the Imperial
Chancellor, l'rince Hohenlohe, in regard
to the disclosure of State secrets which
Prince Bismarck has been making and
continues to utter through the medium of
his personal organ, the Hamburger Nach
richtcn. Prince Hohenlohe, who is prac
tically placed in a position which is very
distressing to him and is desirous of hav
ing a quiet official life, has suggested that
bolh the Emperor and Prince Bismarck
tate some means to bring about an im
mediate cessation of their polemics,
which are endangering the peace of
Europe. Among the stanch adherents
of Prince Bismarck the opinion prevails
that things have already gone too far and
they are agreed that the controversy must
cer.se, but, none of them venture to bu:
gest any plan whereby this opject can be
accomplished. From Munich, Carlsruhe
and other places, where Princa Bismarck
is strong in the possession of friends of in
fluence and high station, it is known posi
tively that supplications have been ad
dressed to him to discontinue the course
he is pursuing as the only means of avert
ing serious trouble.
Apart from the responsibility of the ex-
Chancellor for the revelations of the
Russo-German neutrality treaty and other
disclosures which have been made, the
question has been discussed in Berlin
whether Dr. Hoffman, chief editor of the
Hamburger Nachricuten, ought not to be
indicted ; but, as a result of the discussion,
it was decided that the indictment of Dr.
Hoffman would be as impracticable a
move as to prosecute Prince Bismarck
himself under the articles of the penal
cod<: by which Count yon Arnim and Pro
fessor Geitiekin were tried, convicted and
imprisoned, and under no circumstances
would the Emperor permit such a pro
ceeding as this.
The controversy has now reached an
acute stage and is seriously affecting the
health of Prince Hohenlohe. who is essen
tially of a pacific temperament and accus
tomed to quiet diplomatic combats.
'ihe feverish and implacable tight which
is being waged by Prince Bismarck is
causing the Chancellor to pass many
Bieepless nights, and for this reason the
Emperor is de-irous of putting an end to
the whole matter as speedily as possible.
Otherwise the Kaiser is understood to be
willing to allow Prince BismarcK to ex
pand to his uttermost limit, meeting each
of the developments of his warlare with
explanations marking the present honest
policy of the German Government as con
trasted with the Bbifty diplomacy of the
old Chancellor. In the meantime Hohen
lohe is standing between the Emperor and
Prince Bismarck in the attitude of a
peacemaker, anxious to conciliate both
sides and at least to obtain cessation of a
duel without the precipitation of a na
tional scandal.
Meanwhile it is undeniable that the
effect ol the controversy, coupied with the
articles thereon published in she official
press,- has been to weaken and to decry the
policy of Germany as untrustworthy.
The policy which Mr. McKinley is ex
pected to pursue after his inauguration as
President of the United Btate3 in regard
to bimetallism and the tariff continues to
be discussed iv the columns of the lead
ing newspapers. The Kreuz Zeitung
maintains that there is reason for a feel
in'c of satisfaction among the biruetailists,
as there is hope that the tirst aim ot Mc-
Kinley will be to obtain a settlement of
the monetary question upon an inter
national basis. As to the tariff, the Zei
tung proceeds to advocate the co-opera
tion ot the European powers for a con
certed interpretation of the money doc
trine as international law, and then goes
onto argue la favor of an international
agreement for common duties upon the
leading American imports.
"This movementof acommon European
tariff war in response to the election of
Mr. McKinley," the Zeitung says, "is not
a new suggestion, as the same cry was
heard during the first outburst against the
tariff law when it went into operation in
the United States, but the movement was
seen to be impracticable."
Pursuing the subject, the paper says:
"If it is impossible to achieve joint Eu
ropean activity Germany must proceed
upon independent lines, first creating a
high tariff and then giving notice of the
cessation of the 'most favored nation' Bys
tern as soon as the Government raises its
tariff."
The Zeitung says thi3 would have the
effect to secure the success of negotiations
for v tfeaty based upon the new German
maximum tariff.
The HamDurger Nachrichten relies upon
Mr. iacKinley'n favoring bimetallism on
principle, and believes that he will do his
utmost to obtain an international mone
tary agree me :it.
The Harubur. .y- Oorrespondenz, a semi
official journal % tn that although it is
not in expectatio.. that there will be any
ultimate benefit 10 the commercial rela
tions between Europe and the United
States as a result of the Presidential elec
tion, it is convinced that the bimetallic
movement will rather revive than subside
undeT the administration of President Mc-
Kinley.
The Socialists differ greatly in their
comments upon the defeat of Bryan and
their estimates ol the results ofHhe elec
tion of McKinley. Herr William Lieb
knecht. the Socialist leader, in a com
munication to the VoerTvaerts argues that
there would have been a convulsion of
trade, if Bryan had been elected, which
wouidhave worked serious Injury to the
working people. Mr. Bryan. $lerr Lieb
k:;echt says, is not a scientific socialist,
but is rather an a jitator.
Ex-Court Chaplain Stiecker, in his
Christian Socialist organ, the VoJk, takes
an opposite view, holding that Bryan is a
leader of social reforms based upon Chris
tian principles.
Tiie returns of the imports of American
butter into Germany show that ihe im
portation coniinues'to increase. In 1893
the quantity of American butter brought
to Germany was only 21.500 kilograms. In
1894 ihe aggregate was 296,000 kilograms,
in 1895 375,000 kilograms, and for the first
eight months of 1896 the importation
reached 398,000 kilograms.
The merchants of Hamburg are com
plaining of the strictness with which the
measures of the United States consulate
in that city are now being enforced.
Hitherto the United States Consul has ex
ercised his discretion in legalizing invoices
after shipments had been effected, but
acting under instructions from Washing
ton, the consulate now 'insists upon the
legalization of invoices before or con
temporary with the shipments.
The exports of raw sugar from Ham
burg has taken on such large dimensions
that on Friday five vessels were engaged
at the same time in loading with 10,300
tons of the product. This increase is
largely due, however, to the desire of the
dealers to get as much raw sugar out of
the country as possible before the new
sugar iaw goes into effect.
The great increase in the importation
of American apples into Germany has led
the agrarian newspapers to agitate in
favor of the Government taking measures
to prohibit further imports, alleging that
sources of disease have been discovered in
recent importations of the fruit.
Apropos of the attempts oj the agra
rians to restrict American exports gener
ally the North German Gazette says that
American newspapers are bndly informed
when they assert that the German Gov
ernment contemplates placing lurther
restrictions upon the importation of
American products. The statement that
the inspection here of ail importod tinned
meats has been ordt-red or is about to be
ordered, the Zeitung says, is also erro
neous.
The manager of the Prussian Govern

POSTAL SERVICE REPORT
Great Saving During the Year
and Improvement in
Delivery.
The Franking Privilege Abased Dur
ing the Campaignâ A Penalty
Recommended.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov., B.â First
Assistant Postmaster - General Frank
Jones, in his annual report for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1896, states that
there has during that time been a saving
of $3,278,985, and also shows an improve
ment in the service of delivering the vol
ume of mail matter.
Tne number of Presidential postoffices
is 3684, the salaries of postmasters being
$0,203,900, and the total gross receipts
Irom these offices were $65,282,364.
Mr. Jones recommends that $17,000,000
be appropriated to compensate postmas
ters for the next fiscal year. He asks only
$11,000,000 for clerk hire, a considerable
decrease in proportion to the increase of
clerks to be employed. He recommends
that $75,000 be appropriated for the rental
and purchase of canceling machines. He
thinks that $100,000 is a sufficient sum to
cover advertising expenses regarding un
claimed letters and advocates the adop
tion of the bulletin-board system in this
matter. He recommends that ten in
spectors be assigned to look after the work
in the salary and allowance branch of the
service.
Free delivery service has been estab
lished at twenty-four cities during the year,
and there are now but sixty-three enti
tled to it, but on account of the expense
the remainder could not be benefited.
Experimental free delivery in towns and
villages has shown a reduction in gross
receipts in a majority of offices. By No
vember 1 next rural free delivery will be
tested in about thirty States. There was
a reduction of dismissals of letter-carriers,
which evidences the high standard of dis
cipline.
An estimated expenditure of $13,326,500
is made on account of free delivery sys
tems for the fiscal year 1897-98.
Negotiations are now pending for an
exchange of money orders with Mexico.
Mr. Jones recommends that a penalty
be prescribed for the unlawful use of the
frank of a member of Congress, and sug
gests $300 fine in each case. He says the
law was disregarded during the campaign
just closed. He asks legislation to do
away with private postoffice boxes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1896.
PROSPECTS FOR A
TARIFF MEASURE
The Confident Expressions
of Senators Quay and
Sherman.
Say the Dingley Bill Can Be
Enacted at the Short
Session.
THI3 IS HIGHLY IMPROBABLE.
An Extra Session, a New Senate and
a N.w President Seem to
Be Necossary.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. B.âSena
tors Quay and Sherman have within the
past few days expressed the confident
opinion that at the coming short session
of Conereds an effort will again be made
to pass the Dingley tariff bill through
Congress. This effort, if successful, would
obviate the necessity for calling the new
Congress in extra session immediately
after the inauguration ol Mr. McKinley.
It is therefore conceded that it would be
most desirable to clear up the difficulty
now embarrassing the treasury.
Unfortunately, however, in spite of the
fact that two Senators so eminent in their
party's council as Messrs. Quay and Sher
man ha7e asserted the probability of the
passage of the Dingley emergency bill, it
does not seem likely the measure can pass
the Senate. In the first place, the Re
publicans lack far too many votes to make
a solid compact majority for any pariy
measure like a tariff bill.
The coming short session, at which Mr.
Quay belives a tariff bill can be passed,
will see in their seats on the Democratic
side Messrs. Gibson, Brice, Hill, Palmer
and Blackburn, all of whom will be suc
ceeded next year by Republicans, but all
of whom would talk and vote against a
tariff bill, and who would glory in de
voting their last days in Congress to the
defeat of any tarff legislation. More
over, it is a short session, and at the short
session the Appropriations Committee has
full say in the Senate.
Conceding that the Senate Finance Com
mittee, which at the present time is still
in the power of the free-silver Senators,
couid report the bill to (he Senate with
only the usual routine delay of the Senate
committee, it would still be some time in
J anuary before the measure could be called
up in that body. With only six or eight
weeks remaining to the session in which
the thirteen indispensable appropriation
bills must be passed, it is easy to see how
it is possible for a few Democratic Sena
tors to talk tariff until the Appropriations
Committee would peremptorily demand
the withdrawal of the measure. Besides,
it appears to be forgotten in Mr. Quay's
programme that Mr. Cleveland is still in
ihe White House, and that even if the bill
passed both branches of Congress it would
meet a prompt veto at the other end of the
avenue.
It is the general belief that no serious
attempt will be made to pas 3 the Dingley
bill, but that an extra session of the new
Congress will be called, at which a care
fully drawn protective tariff bill yielding
ample revenue will be adopted, and at
which a bill may also be passed author
izing the Secretary of the Treasury to
issue short-term low-ir.terest bonds suf
ficient to meet any emergency that may
arise until the new tariff bill will bring Iv
sufficient revenue to enable the Government
to meet all its expenditures.
FAR-REACHING TELEPHONE ORDER.
Practically Puts an End to the Western
Electric Company's Exclusive Manu
facturing Rights.
CHICAGO, 111, Nov. B.â ln the United
States Circuit Court yesterday Judge
Showalter issued an order of far-reaching
importance to the telephone industry it:
which the court practically puts an end to
the alleged richt of exclusive manufacture
hela by the Western Electric Company.
The order or entry made in tne case is to
the effect that the Watson telephone
switch patent had "xpired July 30, 1895,
by virtue of its having been tasen out in
Canada by the inventor July 30, 1880. The
discovery that a Canadian patent had
been issued on the invention was made
only recently by the Western Telephone
Construction Company, which concern
was the principal defendant in the suit
brought by the combined Bell ami West
ern electric combination. The court has
had the case in which the Western Elec
tric Company charged infringment under
advisement since last summer and in the
meantime tne Western Telephone Con
struction Company discovered this new
evidence.
Aside from ordering the admission of
this testimony yesterday Judge Showalter
could do nothing further until he renders
hi* decision.
Under the decision in the Bates refrige
rator case the discovery of the Canadian
patent shortens the life of the Watson
concession five years, it having been ruled
that a patent taken out in a foreign coun
try acts against a later patent issued in
this country.
Hi A>S- Missis Ir r 1 CONGRESS.
W. J. Bryan Will ->ou> Devote Himself to
the Cam inn Exposition.
LINCOLN, Nebr. Nov. B.â W. J. Bryan,
as president of the Trans-Mississippi con
gress, is interesting himself in that enter
prise, and since the election result became
known has received a number of calls
from Omaha gentlemen and others urging
him to call a meeting of the congress at as
early a date as practicable. The congress
originated the exposition as a means of
bringing trans-Mississippi States together
in closer v.nion. Omaha was selected as
the site of the proposed exhibition. lowa
ana Louisiana Legislatures have met since
plans for the exposition were perfected,
and each made appropriations to defray
preliminary expenses for arranging a State
exhibit.
Legislatures of other Western States
will meet in January, and those inter
ested in the exposition want an early
meeting of the Trims-Mississippi Con
gross, so that plans may be arranged to
induce Legislatures of Western States to
set aside funds for State exhibits.
These matters were discussed with Mr.
Bryan, ana he was authorized to do what lie
could to further tue interests of the expo
sition. The visiting delegation wants the
Trans-Mississipni Congress to meet about
December 15. No definite action has been
taken by Mr. Bryan, but it is understood
that the annual meeting will be held not
later than that date. The meeting-place
this year is Salt Lake.
The Nebraska Legislature at its coming
session will be naked to make an appro
priation of from $100,000 to $209,000 In be
half of the exposition.
Mr, Bryan will remain 8t his home in
Lincoln for an indefinite period.
MINNIE DUPREE TO WED.
Second Matrimonial Venture of the Cali-
fornia Actress Formally An
nounced.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 9.-A morn
ing paper says: Minnie Dupree, who re
cently finished a two weeks' engagement
at the Boston Museum in the "Two Little
Vagrants," has announced her intention
to forsake the stage at the end of the sea
son for a second matrimonial venture.
The man of her choice is Major William
H. LangJey, a cotton millionaire who lives
at the New Amsterdam Hotel at Fourth
avenue and Twenty-tirst street.
Major Lantrley's first wife, who was
Marie Bell Shepard, got a divorce from
him about a year ago. At the time the
Langleys separated it was said that the
wife received $350,000 for herself and $1,
-000,000 in trust for her three children.
Major Langley is a member of the Man
hattan and other clubs and is reputed to
be worth several million dollars.
Minnie Dupree is a Californian, 26 years
of age, and has played leading part* with
Richard Mansfield, Nat Goodwin and
Stuart Robson.
SNOW IN SOUTH DAKOTA.
The llearu and unseasonable Fall Will
Cause Much Suffering,
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 8. â Reports
from points in South Dakota report a re
markably heavy fall of snow for this
Beason of the year. A Huron special says
from twelve to fourteen inches o! snow
covers the ground in that portion of the
State, more than fell all last winter, and
the heaviest so parly in the season for six
teen years. Thousands of acres of corn
are covered, and but a small portion of
the crop has been threshed. Settlers Rre
unprepared for winter and much suffering
will follow. The snow has drifted and
railway trains are impeded. Chamberlain
and Miller report heavy loss to stock and
much suffering as a result of the severe
weather.

WANT McKINLEY'S FAVOR
CKfic -Seekers of Every Descrip
tion Are Now Presenting
Their Claims.
Wagon â¢ Loads of Flowers Divided
Among Sick Friends or Sent
to Hospitals.
CANTON. Ohio, Nov. B.â Major Mc-
Kinley is rapidly recovering from the
effects of the mental strain and arduous
labors of the campaign, and this evening
expressed himself as being quite fully
rested. He is in excellent health and
spirits. The President-elect spent a very
quiet Sunday. He took a short walk early
in the morning, attended church as usual,
and in the afternoon went for a drive. The
balance of the day Mfttof McKinley passed
.quietly in his library. Among those who
called were: Charles G. Dawes, member
of the executive committee of the National
Republican Committee. Ferdinand W.
Peck and Alexander Revell of Chicago,
Captain A. T. Wimberly of New Orleans
and Congressman Francis H. \vilsou of
Brooklyn, N. Y.
The determination of Major McKinley
to remain in Canton till the middle of this
week on account of the feeble condition of
his wife may keep the stormcloud of
political interest central over Canton for
some days longer. The character of the
visitors to Major McKinley has changed a
good deal since his election.
During the campaign when the railways
made low rates there were hundreds and
thousands of people from the lowly walks
oflife who came to Canton. Now the vis
itors are largely of the political, office- j
holding or office-seeking classes, and only
aspirants for places of the higher grades
take the trouble to come to Canton. For
the apparent purpose of tendering con
gratulations in person many persons who
have great expectations bring themselves
into the horizon of the President-elect.
Applications for official places are begin
ning to come in by mail in large numbers,
and they include appointments from day
laborers up to chiefs of bureaus. Flowers
in unlimited quantities continue to reach
Mrs. McKinley. Every room in the house
is filled with them, and the supply was so
large yesterday afternoou that a wagon
load was divided among sick friends and
the patients in the city hospital.
Among the many letters and telegrams
received by the President-elect to-day
were the following:
R. J. Colcord, chairman State Commute,
Carson, Nev.â The few Republicans of Nevada
extend sincere thanks and hearty congratula
tions to our gallant leader and the Repub
licans of the great East for having saved us
irom dishonor, repudiation and pernicious
heresies of Populism.
W. W. Baker, editor, Portland, Or.â The
Farmer and Stockman extends to you and the
country Its congratulations.
Hon. George C. Perkins, San Franciscoâ l
congratulate you upon your magnificent
victory, assuring prosperity to our common
country. California, lam pleased to say, joins
the Republican columns.
William Barr, chairman Republican County
Committee, San Rafael, Cal.â Marln, the ban
ner Republican county in the State of Califor

cessful campaign.
KENTUCKY'S ELECTORAL VOTE.
Chairman Woodson. <l<tim* a Conspiracy

OWENSBORO, Ky., Nov. B.â ln a com
munication to the United Associated
Presses this evening, Ury Woodson, chair
man of the Democratic State Central Com
mittee, says:
1 have only to nay that Governor Bradley, by
his te.egram of November 6 to Republican Na
tional Committeeman Scott of New York, in
which he said, "Kentucky has certainly gone
for McKluley, and will just as certrlniy be
counted," proves that he is and haÂ» been from
the first iv a conspiracy to steal KentucKy for
McKinley. The Republican State chairman
only claims about 400 plurality out of 425.000
votes, and on November 6, the date of ;he Gov
ernor's telegram, it was known to no man that
Kentucky hud certainly gone for McKinley nor
Bryan either. Nor is it yet.

STATEN ISLAND
MONGOL SLAIN
Highbinders Take the Life
of a San Joaquin County
Gardener.
Sever an Ear and Carry It
Away as Evidence of
Their Success.
TEN CHINESE UNDER ARREST.
Emp oyes of the Murdered Man Sus
pected of Complicity ia
the Crime.
STCCKTON, Cal., Nov. B.â One of the
most brutal murders in the histery of San
Joaquin County was committed last night,
and ten Chinese are in jail here charged
with complicity in connection with the
killing of See Jack, a Mongolian gardener
of Stateu Island. The murder was clearly
the deed of some highbinders' organiza
tion, as the left ear of the murdered man
was cut off and carried away by his
slayer as an evidence to those who em
ployed him that he had disposed of his
victim.
t See Jack was engaged in farming a tract
of land on Staten Island and had two
oiher Mongolians in partnership with him.
A number of almond-eyed coolies were
employed in cultivating the place, on
which was raised garden-truck for the San
Francisco market. The men were all in
the bunkhouse lar.t night, according to
the statement of the occupants, when See
Jack went outside. He was heard quar
reling with another Chinese, but those
â Within did not go outside to see who the
other man was. Shots were heard, and
when the inmates of the bunkhouse
rushed out they found See Jack lying
dead outside, with three builets in him
and his head mutilated where the assassin
had cut off his ear.
The Sheriff's office was notified and the
otacers who went to the island scout this
story. The dead Mongol was found to
have one bullet, froai a 44-caliber pistol,
in his neck; another entered above the
eft nipple, and a third entered his body
from the left side. The missing ear was
cut off so close to the head tuat it must
have been severed with a knife as keen as
a razor. The other Chinese on the place
denied all knowledge of the killing and
united in saying that they knew nothing
until they heard the shots and ran out to
find See Jack iying dead in a pool ot
blood. The Sheriff \s deputies did not be
lieVfe this, and arrested every man on the
place for complicity in the crime.
Tnis county has for years been very free
from highbinder warfare, as the officers
keep a strict watch on all who come from
San Francisco for this purpose and notify
them to leave at once upon their arrival".
On the islands, however, it is difficult to
learn whether representatives of the San
Francisco societies are anout, and this
murder is, without doubt, the work of
some member of the organization of paid
assassins. Ait inquest will be held to
morrow afternoon, when it is expecte.l
that new evidence will be brought out.
Meantime the officers are busy on the
case and expect to implicate some of the
Chinese now under arrest.
OAKLAND BEATS STOCKTON.
Hussell's L* ft- Handed Twirling Him a
Baseball Game,
STOCKTON, Cal., Nov. B.â The Oak
land aggregation of baseball players did
about as it pleased with the crack nine of
Stockton at Goodwater Grove to-day. The
Stockton team had been ieading in the

BUTLETIN'S STATEMENT.
Speaks of the Losing Battle of the Free-
Silrer Force*.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. Bâ Senator
Marion Butler, chairman of the National
Committee of the People's party, has
Issued the following statement:
To the People of the United States: In the re
markable campaign just closed the People's
party was the only party that supported
solidly and unitedly the great and vital issues
represented In the candidacy of Mr. Bryiin.
This was natural, for the People's party came
into existence to bring to the front and to
press to victory tho principles of Lincoln and
Jefferson, already long discarded by the two
old parties.
The money power, feeling reasonably sure of
its control and domination of the leaders and
the controlling influences In the Republican
party in 1892, gave its support to the candi
dacy of Grover Cleveland lor tho special pur
pose of having him, through tne use of
patronage and otherwise, crush out the silver
sentiment in the South and make the leaders
in that party as completely subservient as
those in the Republican party.
To accomplish this purpose four Cabinet
Ministers from the South and an unusually
large amount of patronage was used on the
leaders to the same effect.
It will be remembered that Mr. Cleveland
demanded that Democratic Senators and Con
gressmen give a decisive vote in the interest
of the gold standard before he would even
give out the postotlices. This deep plan mignt
have succeeded had not the People's party at
thU juncture sprung into existence, exposed
the plot, stood in the breach and appealed to
the patriotic hosts of both parties to chock the
scheme of the people's despoiler and rally to a
common cause.
Then the People's party forced the Demo
cratic organization to repudiate Cleveland and
to return to the correct fundamental princi
ples. Not only this, but the People's party
then lorced the Republican parly to cease
hedging and straddling for the purpose of de
ceiving people, and drove it into a stand on
one side or the other of the vital issues at
stake.
The issue now being squarely defined, it was
evident that those influences in the Demo
cratic pa'ty which had dominated and de
bauched the party for a quarter of a cemury
would be driven to the support of a party mat
took a position on the side of trusts, monopo
lies and money gamblers. While on the other
hand it is evident that even though the
lnrger per cent of the Republican party
favored the principles not squarely forced to
the front, yet only a small per cent would In
this campaign support thorn because they
found them advocated by the Democrats. But
had It not been for the prejudice
against the Democratic name as well
as a want ot confidence in Demo
cratic promise?, for which it must be
lairly admitted past experience furnisties am
ple ground, a majority ol the voters of the
country, in spite of the tremendous and un
paralleled forces put forward by the Republi
can managers, would have cast tlfeir vote* for
reform and American independence.
The People's party, with a high patriotism
and an unselfish devotion to principle greater
than ever before exhibited by any other party,
stepped outside of its organization to throw
j its 2,000,000 votes solidly for Bryun. Had not
more than this number of those wbo called
themselves Democrats in 1892 given their sup
port to McKinley, the cause oi the people and
American principles would have triumphed
this year.
This class of Democrats will surely support
the party of monopolies and trusts in the
future. Their places in the ranks of there
form hogis may be taken by patriotic Repub-
I licans. In fact, Bryan would have been elected
I in this contest had even 25,000 silver Repub
j licans come to tne rescue.
The election of McKinley and triumph of the
t gold standard does not express the desires and
! sentiments of the American people. Tne ma
i jority oppose the policy for which he stands,
I und will so vote whenever an opportunity is
! presented for proper alignment. The remark
able and brilliant campaign of William J.
Bryan would have aligned these forces and
marched them to a triumphant victory if any
candidate or leader in American could have
done so under the Democratic banner.

THE HOTTEST REGION ON EARTH.
Water for tho Inhabitants Obtained
From Springs at the Sea Bottom.
The hottest region on the earth's surlace
is on the southwestern coast of Persia, on
the border of the Persian Gulf. For forty
consecutive days in the months of July
and August the mercury has been known
to stand about 100 degrees in the shade,
night and day, and to run up as high aa
130 degrees in the middle of the afternoon.
At Bahrein, in the center of the most
torrid part of this most torrid belt, as
though it were nature's intention to make
the place as unbearable as possible, water
from wells is something unknown. Great
shafts have been >unk to a depth of 100,
200, 300 and even 500 feet, but always with
the same result â no water.
This serious drawback notwithstanding,
a comparatively numerous population
contrives to live there, thanEs to copious
springs, which burst forth from the bot
tom of the gulf more than a mile from
the shore. "Machadores" (divers), whose
sole occupation is that of furnisning the
people of Bahrein with the life-giving
fluid, repair to that portion of the gulf
where the springs are situated and bring
away with them hundreds of baes full of
the water each day. The water of the
gulf where the springs burst forth is nearly
200 feet deep, but these macnadores
manage to fill their goatskin sacks by
diving to the bottom and holding the
mouths of the bags over fountain- jets â
this, too, without allowing the salt water
of the gulf to mix with it. The source of
these submarine fountains is thought to
be in the hiils of Osmond, 400 or 500 miles
away. Being situated at the bottom cf
the gulf it is a mystery how they were
ever discovered, but it is said that they
have been known since the dawn of his
tory. â Popular Science News.
BISHOPS AGAINST A PRINCE.
Long Conflict Over the Fnraous Do
ceaaed Wife's Sister BUI.
The famous deceased wiie's sister bill is
at this moment nearer to passage by the
English Parliament than ever before in
its long and eventful history.
The bill, as some Americans may not
know, seeks to repeal the existing statute
making the marriage 8t a widower with
the sister of his deceased wife null and in
cestuous. Such a statute remains on the
statute-books of England alone of all
civilized or uncivilized countries. Even
in the British colonies and dependencies,
from one end of the empire to the other,
such marriages are permitted. The in
hibition was raised in France Bixty years
ago, and in Germany and Scandinavian
countries even earlier. Iv countries sub
ject to t c spiritual rule of the Church of
Rome such marriages are nominally for
bidden, but are allowed by dispensation.
The history of the repealing bill in Eng
land affords one of the most amusing ex
amples of British clerical obstinacy. For
many years it has been known that the
great majority of British commoners de
sired the'repeal of the statute. Most of
the gentry and even the lords temporal
were of the same inin<t. Even the royal
family, almost without exception, are and
have been with the commoners. The Dis
senters are as a unit in the same party.
The opposition to this vast preponder
ance of opinion lies in the Archbishop of
Canterbury and the Bishops or lords
spiritual. These prelates have held the
balance of power in the House ot Lords,
and year by year have prevented the pas
sage of the repealing law.
This year, greatly to the scandal of
their lordships, the Prince of Wales him
self came up to London and canvassed
among the peers for votes. ThÂ«* bishops
were all the more scandalized because th?
date for the second reading was so fixed aa
not to interfere with the Prince's Ascot
engagements. His Royal Highness suc
ceeded so well as a drummer for votes
that the second reading was passed by a
handsome majority. It has since come to
the thiri reading, and is now ready for
the Commons. The Earl of Dunraveu en
gineered the passage of the bill through
the Lords.
The ultimate fate of the bill depends
upon its fate in the Commons. If it
reaches that body at a comfortable season
before adjournment it will be passed, and
the obnoxious law will cease to be. If it
be deferred till the closing hours it is
likelyto die, and all the troublesome busi
ness will have to be gone through again.
IThe contention over the bill is chiefly
of a religious controversial character. The
Archbishop of Canterbury has indeed con
tended that to permit such marriages
would be to "comproiuise the peace of
families." but with the principle of Ger
many, France, the United States and all
the British colonies before their eyes this
argument has not gone far with the iirtt
ish public.
The present b 11 exempts the clergy of
the Church of England from its opera
tions, insomuch that if the bill be passed
the marriages comprehended in its pro
visions must be performed in England by
Dissenting, Jewish or Roman Catholic
clergymen, or by a civil officer. â New

"MEXICAN VOTE CAN BE FIXED."
The Missive Unfolds a Scheme to
G.ve Picacho Precinct to fne
Fuiionists.
â¢.â 'â â¢ â 
SAN DIEGO, Cat,., Nov. B.âHon. W.W.
Bowers returned this evening from Santa
Ana, where be participated in the jolliii
â¢ cation last night. He was asked if there
" was any change in his fight in the Seventh
District.
."Ye?, there is some little change," re
plied Mr. Bowers, "and the worst of it is
.the change is for the bad. I am still
Â§ ahead, but my plurality is reduced. From
4^rpturns 1 have received to-day I find that
1 have lost 45 votes in Madera County
and a recounting shows that 1 have about
100 plurality now, that i?, counting my
figures as correct. Unless I have been
deceived by telegrams from my friends in
the northern part of the district, 1 am still
ahead and will come out all right in the
official count. . I admit that the figures
are now so close that it is impossible to
say. with certainty whether Mr. Castle or
mvseif is elected. An official count is the
oniy thing that can decide the matter.
I have every reason for believing, how
ever, that I will serve in the next Con
gress."
As an example of the frauds that have
been committed in the rural districts of
this county, if not throughout.the entire
district, attention has been called to
Picacho District, which is a small precinct
on the Colorado River in this county, so
" remote that it is practically inaccessible.
A letter was written by a prominent
. Democrat there to a Democrat now tilling
.1 county office, referring unmistakably to
the manner in which the frauds would be
carried out. Colonel D. Allen, who
seems to be the only stalwart Republican
at -I'ieachc, was watching things too close
ly, and the Democrat in his letter wrote:
"I will send you the name of a Demo
crat and also a Silver Republican. You
can put them on the election board and
. thus we can checkmate D. K. Allen. The
Mexican vote, of course, can be fixed.''
ByafatMl error this letter, instead of
beinc addressed to the Democratic office
holder, was inclosed in a printed envelope
addressed to a Republican. He has it
still, and has given certified copies to
several candidates, who may find use for
Ihem later on. In consequence of the
frauds at Picaclio. McKinley received two
votes and Bryan fourteen. Bowers two and
Cattle fifteen, and the fusion candidate.for
the Assembly, K. Dryder., received fifteen
mor<> votes than Cox, Republican. ~ The
district at the former. election cast an
almost solid Republican vote. Though
Mr. Bowers is silent on this point, it is
â  openly predicted by bis intimate friends
that if Castle receives a plurality in the
official count. Bowers will contest the
election in Congress, where he will be
sure to receive a hearing and an investiga
tion into the frauds.

MOXTEItEY DEMOCRAT'S PLIGHT
Tlruan'* D'fcitt Cause* Him to Give a
Republican a Wheelbarrow Ride.
MONTEREY, Cat.., Nov. The people
on Alvarado street this afternoon were
very mach amused at seeing a small pro
cession coming down the street headed by
a local drum corps, as the result of an
election bet. The waper was between City
Treasurer Gunzendorfer, Republican, and
Night Watchman William Kilpatrick,
fus'onist. The conditions were that the
loser should wheel the winner in a wheel
barrow from the plaza at one end of Alva
raao street to the custom-house at the
other end and back to the starting point.
A proviso in the agreement was that if the
loser should at any time daring the march
desire to quench his thirst the ore in the
barrow would pay for it.
According to agreement, Kilpatrick was
on hand and ready at 4 o'clock to make
the start. Dr. WestfalJ, one of the prom
inent physicians of Mont marched
just in front of the wheelbarrow with a
large paper rooster in one hand, bearing
the inscription "1G to IâNit," and his
case of surgical instruments in the other
hand. Kilpatrick was thirsty at each of
the fourteen refreshment places on Alva
rado street while both
marching ways.

It was noticed and has been tally com

While others rejoiced, the spurious Re

leaders of the counterfeit party had a sin

How " Uncle Sam" Got Ilia Name.
The nickname, "Uncle Sam," as applied
totheUn'ted States Government, is said
to have originated as follows: Samuel Wil
son, commonly called "Uncle Sam," was
a Government inspector of beef and pork
at Troy, N. V., about 1812. A contractor,
Elbert Anderson, purchased a quantity of
provisions, and the barrels were marked
"E. A.," Andc-rson'.s initials, and "U. S."
for United States. The latter initials were
not familiar to Wilson's workmen, who
inquired what they meant. A facetious
feliow answered: 'I don't know, unless
they mean 'Uncle Sam.' " A vast amount
of property aiterward passed through Wil
son's hands marked in the same manner,
and he was often joked upon the extent
of his possessions. The joke spread
through all the departments of the Gov
ernment, and before lone the United States
was popularly referred to as "Uncle
Sam." âLadies' Kome Journal.

NEWS OF A BATTLE IXPECTED
Men of Usal Will Atttmpt a Lynch

a Capture.
CAHTO. Cal., Nov. B.â A messenger
who arrived at Fsal 10-night lrom the
vicinity of Island Mountain reports hav
ing met the Sheriff's posse about 3 o'clock
to-day at a point close to the Trinity
County line and about forty miles north
from Usal. The officers were confident
they were on the right trail of the assas
sins of Rancher Mudgett, and would over
take them before dark. The Sheriff's
party had gotten near enough to the flee- |
JOHN H. MUDGETT, the Wealthy Rancher of Usal, Whose
Assassins Are Now Leading a Sheriff's Posse a Lively Chase*
l ng criminals at one time to-day to see
two of them pass over a high elevation of
land just north of Island Mountain. The
murderers, discovering the pursuers,
quickly left the trail and disappeared in
the timber. The horses of the Sheriff's
men appeared fresh and capable of doing
many hours of service beibre aark.
Under Sheriff Handy and posse show
no fear in snch close pursuit, keoping up
rapid riding and plunging into canyon
trails where there is great danger of being
ambushed. The country about Island
Mountain is rough and heavily timbered
and dark jungles are numerous. The
long, damp grasses that almost obliterate
the trails make pursuit slow by day and
impossible at night.
The excitement in this region shows no
abatement, and threats of lynching made
by friends of the dead man arc not idle
and grow more alarming. Cooler heads
do not approve of such swift vengeance
being meted out and have conveyed their
fears to the posse 1 that in the event of a
Capture it can take the prisoners by some
unfrequented traii to Ukiah.
Fears are entertained that the officers
will be ambushed. These forebodings nre
based upon the known treachery of the
two half-breed Ind'ans, Noble and Dodge.
Noble, in particular, has the sneak in
stincts of a full-blooded Indian. He has
but one eye, has remarkable ability as a
marksman, and frequently exhibited his
skill about town by tos3ing up a quart can j
into the air and, with a revolver in each !
hand, keeping the can dancing in midair
until the chambers of the guns became j
empty. Should the officers corner this j
man he wil' shoot and will not waste am
munition.
Last night a heavy rain and wind storm
set in, making trail travel more difficult
and delaying the return of the messencers
senttotho scene. A volunteer party of
five men, friends of Mudgett, left early
this afternoon to join the pursuing party, |
and witli this additional reinforcement |
the escape of the accused men seems
doubtful.

No finer weather for conrsing than that
of yesterday could be imagined, and as a
consequence, the hares ran well.
The temporary closing of Ocean View
park, made necessary because of the ma
licious action of some person in cutting
the fences and allowing the hares to es
cape, turned the coursing public to Ingle
side, and a big crowd at that place was the
conseqnence.
Blackette, P. C. Curtis' fast and clever
bitch, showed her quality by defeating the
best dogs in the State and getting away
with ths first prize.

An Artistic Ev.'nt Well Worth a
Journey Through the Rain
to Erj)y.
Perbarjs Mr. Hinrichs. contented him
self, upon viewing the scantily filled house
last night at the Baldwin, as his illustrious
compatriot, "Papa Haydn," is said to
have done on a similar occasion, with a
"Oh, never mind, de music will sound de
! better! ' Be that as it may, the Hinrichs
j lieel 'Top" last night was,' taken as a
I whole, a musical treat, and thoroughly
| enjoyed by the "small but appreciative
audience."
The programme opened with the "Coro
nation March" from the Folkun<Â»er by
| Kreischman, after which Wagner's soul
stirring strains, as heard in the "Tann
hauser Overture," evoked hearty applause.
It was h andled . in * a vigorous manner,
which, however, did not prevent an artistic
i climax. .
The air from Bach's "Suite in D" was
played with a good deal of uncertainly â
some of the strings being a half measure
I or so behind the others â but a second ren
; dition fully compensated for this and the
audience manifested its approval by
| heartily applauding. Bizet's "Arlesienne
I Suite" was performed, the adagio being
! rendered. willi exceeding refinement and
delicacy. â â ...' , ; â¢*â¢"' . â â  . -'

j did sonic good work in the exacting tenor
solo ; from the ' first act tof Leo Delibes'
"Lakme," although, the orchestra was
rather too much in evidence arid almost
drowned his heroic efforts in some pass
age?. .
The duet with Mrs. Priest-Fine, how
ever, was dramatically rendered, but the
gem was found in the "Bell Song., for so
prano, which showed off the exceptional
flexibility of Mrs. Fine's voice. ; It is not
an â¢ easy thing to attack an altitudtnous
note with the v "haif voice," but this she
accomplished with ease and without vary

SHOOTING MELEE
AT MONTEREY
An Eastern Tourist Wounds

Bartender.
Mexican Friends of His Victim
Pummel the Stranger
Unmercifully.
QUARREL IN A KENO HALL.
The Revolver-Wielder Is Accused of
Neglecting to Pay fcr Sundry
Drinks.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., NO7. B.â John
Smith, a bartender in the Seal Rock, a
faro den in old Monterey that has been
the scene of many a bloody affray, was
shot and dangerously wounded last night
by Harry T. Force, an Eastern tourist.
Force was in turn pounced upon by Mexi
can friends of the bartender, who gave
him an unmerciful beating.
After the McKinley parade last night
Force and two friends, also from the East,
walked up Alvarado street, around the
old plaza and into the oldest portion of
Monterey. They were attracted while
passing tbe Seal Rock by the rattle of the
keno box inside. They entered the place
and after watching the game for a while
they began to play themselves. They won
several kenos during their stay and, ac
cording to the rules of the house, treated
on each'of these winnings.
Their luck and bad whisky did not seem
to agree. Force became boisterous and on
one occasion failed to treat and on another
did not settio for the treat. The barkeeper
protested and informed Force that he
would have to settle for his drinks or quit
the game. The Easterner would not stop
playing and claimed he had already paid.
One word brought on another until the
stranger followed Bartender Smith into
the front room and said that if Smith
would come outside he would settle with
him. Smith came from behind the bar
and was about to follow Force outside,
when the latter drew a revolver and shot
at him, the buliet taking eftect in the arm
and terribly lacerating it.
Smith jumped for his antagonist and
Force tried to shoot again at close quar
ters. The first shot had attracted the at
tention of Smith's Mexican friends and
they rushed to the rescue. Force's two
friends fled to the St. Charles Hotel, about
a block away, but he could not get away.
He received an unmerciful beating at
the bands of the bartender's friends.
Policeman Kilpatrick appeared on the
scene and Force was taken to jail and
Smith to the nearest hotel, where medical
aid was summoned.
Force, together with his mother and
two friends, reside in New Jersey. They
have been in California for about six
months, making a tour of the PttUe. They
came to Monterey from Tassajtira Springs
about a week ago and were stopping at
the St. Chailes Hotel. They are on their
way home and intended leaving here to
day.
REED WINDOW DEDICATED
Ihe Memory of Sittrr Helen Elizabeth
PACIFIC GROVE, Cau, Nov. B.â Right
Rev. W. P. Nichols, D. D., Bishop of Cali
fornia, to-day delivered the dedicatory
sermon for the Reed memorial window at
the Episcopal Church of St. Mary's-bythe-
Bea. The service of blessing and dedica
tion, performed by Bishop Nichols, was
impressive. Rev. Mr. Fackenthall, the
rector, read tbe morning service, after
which the Bishop gave a scholarly dis
course from the text " The garment of
praise for the spirit of heaviness."
In the course of the nermon he spoke of
the lite and work of Miss Reed, to whose
memory the window is dedicated. He told
of how much of the present prosperity
of trie church at Pacific Grove was due to
her; of her being ordained deaconess
with the name of Sister Holen Elizabeth,
and of how her increasing labors among
the poor and sick in the slums of San
Francisco broke her health and brought
her useful life to an untimely end.
The window, placed directly over the
altar, is a representation of the annuncia
tion of the angel to ihe Virgin Mary, and
is both beautiful and costly.
UNWRITTEN HISTORY.
Sheridan's Hide and the Whisky That
â¢ John AVilkes ltooth Drank.
"The maddest man I ev,Â»r savr," said
Marshall Philips, "was General Sheridan
a minute or so after he had been informed
that some ono had sold a horseshoe, get
ting a high price for it, on the ground that
it was one of the shoes worn by Sheridan's
horse, Winchester, on his famous ride in
the Shenandoah Valley. The general
fairly boiled. 'In the lirst place.' paid
General Sheridan, 'my twenty-mile ride
never took place, for the distance was but
fifteen miles. The writer of those verses
was a better poet than topographer, and
we might excuse him for that. Next, I
never bad any horse by that exact name,
and if 1 had, myself or none of those
around me would nave thought of secur
ing his shoes and holding them for a rise.'
"I did my best to quiet him, and only
succeeded in doing so by telling him the
relic whisky story, which used to ba told
of the barkeeper of the little place on
Tenth street, adjoining Ford's Theater,
the place where John Wilkes Booth got a
drink just before he assassinated Presi
dent Lincoln. The place was run as a
barroom for several years after the Gov
ernment took possession of the theater
property. Visitors to the city always
took in the barroom as one of the sights,
and some of them took in the liquor sold
there. The barkeeper had a way. after
telling the story or the assassination, of
pointing to a small demijohn and saying:
'Booth asked me to hand him this demi
john, and he poured out a heavy drink
and swallowed it down in one gulp. There
is a little of the same identical whisky in
it yet.'
"Frequently some of those w"ho took in
the story would go further and ask for a
taste of the whisky. This wish was al
ways graiified for the price. One day a
Maine man had a taste of it. For this he
was charged 25 cents. The taste was,
however, a good-sized drink, of the Maine
regulation size, too. After putting down
his class he remarked :
'"And so that was the whisky that
Booth drank just before he killed Lin
coln, was it? Well, sir, until thi* time I
have always blamed Booth, but that
whisky, sir, would make a man kill his
own mother!" â^Yashington Star.

PIRST BUILDEE OF THE VATICAN
The Vast Structure Js Mainly Due to
Pope Nicholas V.
The present existence of this palace is
principally due to Nicholas V, the builder
Pope, whose gigantic scheme would startle
a modern architect. Ri3 P i an was to build
ihe church of St. Peter's as a starting
point, and then to construct one vast cen
tral "habitant" for the pupal administra
tion, covering the whole of what is caiied
the Borgo, from the castle of Sant' An
gelo to tbe cathedral. In ancient times
a portico, or covered way supported
on columns, led frpm the bridge to
tbe church, anil it was probably from this
real structure that Nicholas began lm im
aginary one, only a nnall part of which
was ever completed. That small portion
alone comprises the basilica and the Vati
can Palace, which together form by far
the greatest contiuous mass of buildings
in the world. Ths Colosseum i 3 195 yards
long by 15(5 broad, including ths thickness
of the walls. St. Peter's Church alone is
203 yards long and IM broad, so that tbe
whole Coios^etini would easily stand upon
the ground-plan of the church, while the
Vatican Palaca is more than half as large
again.
Nicholas V died in 1455, and the oldest
parts of the present Vatican Palace are
not older than his reign. They are gen
erally known as the Torre Borgia. from
having been inhabited by Alexander VI,
who died of poison in the third of the
rooms now occupied by the library, count
ing from the library side. The windows
of these rooms look upon the large sauare
court of the Eelvedere, and that part of
the palace is not visible from without.
Portions ot the substructure of the
earlier building were no doubt utilized by
Nicholas, and the secret gailery which
connects the Vatican with the mausoleum
of fiadrihn is generally attributed 10 Pope
John XXIII, who died in 1417; but on
the whole it may be said tbat the Vatican
Palace is originally a building of tbe
period of tlie Renaissance, to which ail
successive popes have made additions. â

BEACHED OFF
BLACK POINT
The Bark Canada Ashore
and Stuck Fast in
the Mud.
She Tried to Sail Up the Bay
While in a Disabled
Condition.
THE RESULT OF A COLLISION.
Che Anchor Was Gone and the Other
Cams Adrift as She Attempted
to Drop It.
The American bark Canada, sixteen
days from Union City, is on the beach
off Black Point. She is resting on a muddy
bed and it is thought she can be pulled
into deep water before any damage is
done.
The Canada arrived outside the heads
early Saturday morning and in order to
save expense her captain, C. Wicksberg,
refused a tow and anchored outside in
tending to sail into port yesterday after
noon.
Owing to a collision with the steamer
City of Pnebia off Otter Point, in the
Straits of Fuca, on the night of October
24 the vessel lost one anchor, her martin
gale was carried away, and the jibboom
was so badly damaged that she could carry
no head sail.
In ihis crippled condition the vessel
started into port. Everything went well,
and the vessel was about to anchor off
Black Point when an unfortunate acci
dent occurred. As the anchor was being
dropped the chain broke and the ship was
helpless.
Sho drifted toward the beach and al
though strenuous efforts were made by
the captain and crew to keep the bark in
deep water, she was beached by the strong
rddy and was soon fast in the mud.
Tugs were summoned by the Merchants'
Exchange to mill the Canada lrom her
unpleasant position, but the tide had re
ceded and she was held too fast.
The vessel is loaded with piles and is in
no danger, and owing to these facts the
tug men may wait until high tide to-day
before undertaking to pull her into deep
water again.

It is one of the most interesting places
in the country. The old walled town i 3

the newer town built round the harbor.
This harbor when the boats are in is a
very beautiful sight. The sardine nets are
all hanging from the masts to dry in the
sun; they are so fine in texture tbat they
look like silken gauze. Some of them are
brown, others a delicate blue-gray, and as
they wave in the wind they give exquisite
masses and blendings of color.
Sardine fishing and all the processes of
preparing: and 'pteking the dainty little

many thousands of men and women, "it

A HEW CHARTER
ON NEW LINES
How the Municipal Reform
League Would Ad
vocate It.
Contend That All Power Should
Be Centralized in a Beard
of Supervisors.
NEED OF A NEW OEGANIC LAW
J. Munsell Chase Tells How a Pure
Municipal Government Can Be
Inaugurated,
Regardless of what may come out of the
present agitation looking toward the re
submission of tbe vexed cnart?r question
to tbe people, it is definitely settled that
the Municipal Reform League will oppose
the measure as it stands to-day. The or
ganization recognizes the almost absolute
need of a new organic law, but they pro
pose to reach this end along lines not
hitherto considered by the general masses.
At a meeting last Friday night of the
Municipal Reform League, the recent
campaign for and against the defeated
charter was discussed by the various
speakers present, among the number be
ing Rev. Dr. J. E. Scott, Dr. J. F. Wetzel,
A. D. d'Ancona, J. M. Reynolds, P. J.
Healy, T. Carl Spelling and J. Munsell
Chase. Resolutions were adopted con
gratulating the citizens of San Francisco
on the defeat of the proposed charter and
upon the adoption of the fourth and fifth
amendments to tbe State constitution,
whereby cities are enabled to secure more
simple and workable governments than
was possible under the constitution as it
formerly existed.
The Call was complimented on the
fairness it had disr layed during the cam
paign in opening its columns to both sides
of the controversy.
The need of a charter that should em
body all the best ideas of municipal or
ganization as worked cut in Eastern and
European cities was agreed upon by all
present, and the club decided to go ahead
with the work of securing a charter, the
fundamental principles of which shall be â
civil service and the concentration of
power in a large board of responsible Su
pervisors.
J. Munsell Chase, one of the acknowl
edged leaders in municipal reform, when
asked to outline the league's ideas and
also the easiest way to accomplish the end
desired, said:
"We have defeated four proposed char
ters in San Francisco, the first in IS3O and
the second in 1883. Four years later an
other charter was proposed, but it, too,
went under. Now comes this last, its de
feat being oi so recent occurrence as to
need no comment. An essential teature
of this continual failure has been the cen
tralization of power. This is particularly
true o:' tne last, two charters. San Fran-
Cis-co is in need of a new organic law.
'"The questions we now have to consider
are: What shall be its essential features,
and bow shall we go about it in order to
secure a charter satisfactory to all classes?
As to the last point, first, deliberation
should be the order of the day. The people
who are in favor of a new government
should get together and determine just
what they wish. I think eight months'
time would be none too short for the con
sideration of -neb a document, and I do
not think it would be expedient to try and
get a charter wuhin two years.
"Representatives should be called from
the Merchants' Association, Board of
Trade, Chamber of Commerce, Federated
Trades, Good Government Clubs. Civic
Federation, Municipal Reform League
and aii similar organizations, and this
body should proceed to tbe formation of a
charter. Having done this they stiouli
select a board of freeholders and have a
special election called for their election,
who in turn should propose the charter
thus prepared to the people for adoption
or rejection. I believe if tnis policy is
followed a charter can be prepared which
will be adopted.
"There are two schools of municipal ref
ormation, those who are in favor of cen
tralizing power largely in a Mayor and
those who would centralize power in a
large Board of Supervisors. I belong to
the latter. ' I believe that the people can
be trusted and that we can never have rea
sonably satisfactory government until we
do learn to trust them. I wish to see the
city redistricted so as to give either thirty
six or Beventyrtwo wards; that is, two or
four wards for each Assembly district,
with a Supervisor elected from each oisÂ»
trict, and to see them at all times held re
sponsible. Our present ward divisions are
absurd. They give the Third Ward, which
bad in 1894 640 voters, as mucH influence
as the Eleventh Ward, witn 18.631 voters.
This is well illustrated in the vote of IS'J-i,
which was as follows:
' ' Firs: Ward, 9 entire precincts, 1 fractional

"Another difficulty we want tp remedy
is to ailcw each district' to do its own se
lecting. Under the present system, the
onljTrequiaite is that a man shall reside in
the distr ct he is supposed to tepresent
while the whoie City votes for him. This
system renders it possible for a man to be
el#c*ed from the Firs: Ward sho did not
receire in that w*.rd a single vote.
"Another objection to electing at large
rests upon this met, that a Supervisor is
allowed by law to use no more than $120
in making nis canvass. No man can mÂ«kt
a canvass iaSan Francisco on that amount
of money. To have sent a letter to each
Toter in San Francisco in the last demon
would cost $1200. Tne absurdity oi a man
attempting to make such a campaign on
$120 is manifest. But witn small wards,
containing not more than I^oo votes each'
it would be quite possible for eac.i candi
date to make known his views to each
voter, and use no more than the law at
present ai.ows.
"Under the present system each elector
is pupposea to vote for twelve SaporviÂ»or>.
He niUbt select these from airson- tifty to
sixty candidates. It 1* very difficult for
the ordinary man to make an intelligent
selection. Under the system which we
advocate the voter would be cal.ed on to
make a selection from only five or six can
dates. There would be no confusion, and
a man would have no excuse for making a
poor selection.
"We want direct responsibility of Su
pervisors to their electors. No "business
man would pass over the management of
bis business to any man for a definite
period of two or four years without hlm
â¢elf holding some power to cU^ck his rep
resentative in that business, and yet that
is what the people do in governmental
matters. We believe that many officers
now elected by the people should be made
appointive, but the power of appointment
should be placed in the hands of the Su
pervisor- and not in the hands of a dicta
torial Mayor. In this connection I will
call attention to the fact that the fifth
amendment to the constitution just passed
wi!l enable us to accomplish that result.
"I find, in consulting the constitution of
California that it is possible to secure a
vote of the people as to whether they want
this power concentrated in the Mayor
or .Board of Supervisors. Article 11 sec
tion 8 says:
In submitting any such charter or amend
ment thereto any alteration, article or propo
sition may be presented for the choice of the
voters, and may be voted on separately with
out prejudice to others.
BABES IN THE STORM.
Secretary Welch Takes a Woman In
Charge for Cruelty to Children.
Secretary Welch of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children brought
to the Central police station, about 10
o'clock last night, a Mexican woman who
gave her name as Mrs. Joaquin Sanchez
and two chilrden, one a babe in arms and
the other a boy (J years old. The officer
found the woman running about Broad
way, near Stockton street. She was par
tially intoxicated and the children were
drenched and shivering.
The woman stated that her husband was
out of town and for four days she had oc
cupied, with three Mexicans, a house on
Card alley. Last night the men got to
fighting and she sought refuge in the
streets.
The society will look after the children
to-day.
THE SIGN OF THE CROSS
Interesting Sermon on It by the
Paulist Fathers at St.
Mary's.
Explanation of a Pious Catholic Cus
tom Which is Held by Many to
Be an Enemy of Evil.
An interesting "five-minutes' " sermon
was preached at the morning masses in
St. Mary's Church, California and Dupont
streets, by the Paulist fathers as follows
on the text in the Epistle: "All whatso
ever ye do in word or in wore, all things
do ye in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ."
"This was tbe custom of tha early Chris
tians and they never began a work without
invoking the Name of the Lord, under
whose protection they placed themselves.
For it was He who had commanded them,
'If you love Me keep My commandments.'
and they tried to carry out His words by
bringing all their actions into harmony
with those commandments and by invok
ing His sacred Name upon them.
â¢'The Name which Christ has taugbtHis
disciples was the sacred Name of the
Triune God. He ;oid tbem to 'teach all
nations, baptizing them in the .Name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost;' aud it was under the invoca
tion of this most holy Name that it De
came customary from the very day of
Pentecost to ble^s tnemselves, iheir pos
sessions, their actions, ana those things
which belong to their neighbors.
"The most poorly instructed Catholic
knows how to bless himself. It is among
tbe first of the divine things that the
mother teaches to her infant and it is the
iast thing which a bad Catholic evor for
gets. When the hand is plac-d on t.'ie
foreliead, the breast, the left shoulder and
the right, and the lips pronounce. 'In the
name ol tbe Father, and of the Son, and
of the Ho!y Ghost, Amen,' tbe person
who docs this is blessing himself in ac
cordance with the precept laid down in
the Epistle of to-day, 'Ail things do ye in
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.'* He
is calling on the Most Holy Trinity whom
Je-us Christ taught to protect him, to
guide him, to strengthen him and to re- |
ceive him at the hour of his greatest need. |
He is moreover professing his telief in |
that doctrine and bearing witness that he â 
is ready to hold it firmly as the essence of j
the Catholic faith which alone is able to I
save his soul.
"If every one who names this divine
name were to carry out tbe injunction of
the apostle what a very different state of
affairs we should see on the face of the
earth. Men beginning their every deed in
tne name of Christ would be exceedingly
careful what those actions would be.
Now many an evil deed could be avoided
if this was only a universal custom. How
many an uncharitable conversation could
be left unuttered if every word was meas
ured by that holy name of Christ. How
the evil thoughts wnich are so easily con
ceived In the mind wouid be bani-hed and
put to flight if at the first moment when
they come tbe sacred name of Jesus were
invoked.
"The.sign of the holy cross ia one of the
most potent enemies of evil, either in
thought, word or deed. It is powerful to
drive away not only temptation but sin
its-elf. It put to flight those hosts of evil
and fallen spirits who have our damna
tion at heart and who are ever about us
to help us en in the ways of sin and wick
edness. It is a great aid to us to help us
to persevere in the light and holy way of
life.
"One of the first things that we do when
we arise in the morning is to bless our
selves. Let this sign of the cross follow
us all day long; and let it not be the first
and the last" time, either. When we are
at work let it precede our every action, by
making it on the ft r- head "or the heart
;hat it may not provoke any blasphemous
remark from nn believers, and we shall be
surprised to find what a difference will
come over our daily lives."

TUFTS-LYONS ARE
THE CHAMPIONS
Defeated the Nevada Stars
and Won the Trophy
in Contest.
Riviera, the Citrus-Belt Twirler,
Too Skillful ior His
Opponents.
MADE SIXTEEN STRIKE-OUTS-
Men From the S\!ver Sat Outplayed
at All Points by the Caii
for nil Lads.
The amateur baseball championship of
tbe Pacific Coast, including the silver
trophy and pennant, was yesterday won
by tne Tufts-Lyons team of Los Angeles.
They won the deciding game from the
Nevada Stars, champions of the Silver
State.
The prime cause of the defeat of the
young men from Virginia City was their
inability to size up the delivery of Riviera,
the Los Angeles twirler. Kiviera is a
little, spindle-shanked, copper-colored
son of a Spaniard, with a long arm and a
long head and an over-developed baseball
tendency. He is about as big around as
an umbrella, and looks as though he
might be wafted out of the lot by a strong
gust of wind. But the manner in which
he can work shoots and curves into tbe
flight of a thrown ball is a wonder to all
beholders. Tbe heavy-weight Miners
were as pigmies in his hands and no less
than sixteen strikeouts were placed to his
credit.
Next to the pitcner, Mangerina, the
other half of tbe Los Angeles battery, was
the bright particular star of tn.e game. He
is even smaller than Riviera and looks to
weigh about three pounds less than a
straw hat. He, however, is a burale of
nerves, has an eye like an eagle, and is at
all times busi r than a boy in a store.
But one of the visitors from Nevada suc
ceeded in stealing a base from him, and
be played the game through without a
battery or fielding error. He also suc
ceeded in obtaining his base on oalls no
less than three times, and out of tlie other
three times at bat secured a two-bagger.
Of the other citrus-belters, Strohn ex
celled at the bat, h obtaining two singles
and a double out of six times up. while
Franek, Cummings and Tyier made two
safe hits each.
Moore ana Radcliff or the Nevadans
made two hits apiece, one of Moore's swats
beina over the right-field fence.
Neither side scored a run during the first
two innings.' Riviera struck out six of the
Miners and two of the Los Angeles lads
perished in the same manner. The other
four were retired at first. In the third
inning, after Perrow had made three fruit
less jabs at the sphere, MerKle secured a
hit, but was thrown out trying to steal
second. Moore then hit the ball squarely
on the nose ana lifted it over the rieht
faeld fence for a home run. Radcliff re
tired the side by fanning ont. In their
half of the tuira the orange-eaters saw the
Nevadans one and raised them one
Strohn. who was first at bat, hit safely
and Franek iollowed suit Cummincs
struck out. Mangerina secured a base on
balls, fhhng tde bans. Farrell was re
tired en a poorly to Perrow, when farmer
Tyler dropped a sale one into leltfield and
Strohn and Franek scored. Tufts retired
the side on a fly to Randall. ""red
Hits by Riviera, Stiohn and Franek
earned a run for .the Tuf.s-Lvons in the
fourth, and in the fifth the Nevadans tied
the score on Franck's error, a base on balls
and hits by Moore and, Radcliff. That
however, was the end of tneir run-gettine

bai for Los Angeles in the sixth inning.
He obtained a life on Merkie's error, went

effort to capture a grounder from Farrell
bat after Mangerina had been given a basa

Tufts then hit safely Drinking in Manger

play and Tyler crossed the rubber. Wooif
sKill flew out first and Strohn coming to
the bat for the second time lifted the ball
into the crowd securing a two-base bit
and scoring Tuits. Franek retired the
side on an easy one to the pitcher.
The disastrous sixth inning took the
heart out of the Miners, and after that
they secured bat two widely separated
hits. The lads from the citrus-beit, how
ever, got two tallies in the seventh on
two hits and an error and two more in
the eiehth on Franck's life and doubled by
Cummiiiirs and Mangerina.
At tlie close of the eama the crowd from
the bleachers rustud upon the field, cap
tured the Los Aiij-eies boys and almost
smothered them witli their congratula
tions.
The Hawaiian band was also accorded
an ovation for the excellent selections
rendered during the afternoon.

1 333 Sliuket St.. S. Jb\-tSead *<" Circular)NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
â  â¢ The proposed emergency call is the chio
topic of talk at the armories. It is said
the troops are not to be cabled out to as
certain the number of men that can De
rallied within a given time, but rather to
show the condition, so far as equipment
is concerned, of the men responding to
__the call. Take for example Major Sime's
battalion of the First Infantry. When
his troops are formed in line ready for
duty, it may be noted here many of the
.men have serviceable overcoats, blankets,
'canteens and Haversacks. The same ob- j
servation may be made in the other bat
talions. One would suppose that ordin- |
ary inspection of equipment would im
â¢ part the information desired in this re
spect, but tlie emergency call may pre
sent the deficiency in the light of an ob
â¢ ject lesson.
â¢The election of a Legislature largely
â  Republican leads men of ' the National
Guard to believe that a fair appropriation
of public money for the guard will be â 
made at Sacramento next winter. What- :
eyer may be the political opinion of the j
men in the guard, it is generally acknowl- j
edged that the RepuDlic*ns are more i
liberal in supporting the military arm of
the State than the opposition, composed ',
of Democrats and Populists. There dots i
not seem to be any demand for an increase
[b the numerical strenuth of the guard, ;
yet there are many men of good, sound
judgment in military matters who con
lend that the Seco.id Brigade, located In
San Francisco, should have a battery of
light artillery. Others "till entertain the
notion tnat the First Intantry should be
â¢ organize ias an artillery regiment and in
structed in the handling of the modern
guns now mounted in the batteries to de
fend the harbor.
The same rica was in vogue when the
oid Second Artillery, N. G. C, was or
ganized, but during ihe entire existence of I
â¢ tnat organization no instruction was j
given in other than infantry drill. It Is |
conceded by many who are well posted
in military affairs that a mistake was
made vfli n the light artillery of the brig
â¢ ade was reorganized out of existence. A
brigade of infantry ought to have at least
one battery of tield artillery.
Considering that California has been so
li-beial in allowance of money to build up
and sustain a creditable division of State
troops, ti.e Conere.-sional delegation from
this State should manage to procure from
â¢ the War Department rive or six of the new
rifled breech-loading guns, such as are
now us*d by the light batteries in the reg
ular service.
Next to Xew York and Pennsylvania,
California is the most enterprising State
of the Unio:i in the duty of maintaining a
w.ell-organized military force. The con
stitution requires this maintenance from
every State, but many have observed the
letter rather than the spirit of the require
ment. On a proper submission ot the
facts to the War Department, California
â¢shoukl be ab!e to secure from the Govern
ment a proper equipment of arms for tne
National Guard. Concerted action on the
part of the Governor, the United States
Senators and the Representatives in Con
gress should be able to obtain what the
guard needs.
Nothing has-been officially transmitted
from Sacramento to indicate whether
Governor Budd, the comrnaiider-in-chief,
has accepted the resignation of Colonel
,Georee B. S perry, inspector-general of
rifle practice.
_ Colonel F. S. Chadbourne, paymaster
general on the Governor's staff, has re
turned from Chicago and New York. Dur
ing his absence he sustained the loss of
his mustache.

Your kinri fivorof the stÂ»i lust., ciial;eiiuing
ihe F'rst Regiment, N. G. 11.. to shoot a maicn
at 200 yards with 100 men against a like pum
bcr ol men from the First Ri-gicent Iniantry,
N. G. C, was duly received, and 1 rave the
honor to iniorm you thai at a cpecial meeting
ot the officers held last evening it was unani
mously vott-d to accept said challenge, pro
vi.led you will permit us to mnlce a slight
change ln reference to the rifle used by one of
ihe companies, whic i is armed by the Govern
ment with the I^ee- Remington, all the other
companies being armed with ihe Springfield.
As you have asked us to name the date, Â«c
' would succest that it take place between the
Ist and 15th of January, 1897; captains of the
respective teams to notify representatives of
opposing teams r>f date selected by his team.
Consul-General C. T. Wilder will represent
our team In San Francisco, and will also rep
resent us in. tlie matter of the tr.iphy. We will
communicate with him by this mail.
The interest tbut will attend such an inter
national match l* sure to result in good shoot
ing for both regiments. May the best team
win. I have the honor to be, very respectfully,
your obedient servant, R. H. McLean,
Colonel First Regiment, N. G. 11.
Colonel Macdonald of the First Infantry
was seen last evening and as Keel if the
modification desired by Colonel McLean
of the Harrison Guard would be accepta
ble. He replied that no objection would
be interposed to the use of the Lee-Rem
ington rifle. The challenge is now ac
cepted and the California guardsmen may
iiiive to do some first-class shooting to
win the trophy.
There wns a good deal of talk about a
day's outing this month for the First
Regiment, but as the holidays are approach
ing and requiring the constant attention
'of many of the men of tlie regiment at
their places of employment, the field-day
may be postponed until February 22. Now
that the match Â«nth the Harrison troops
is no longer a conjecture, but an assorfd
1 fact, it will rrqmre some active work to
A pel one hundred men in good shooting
V f<mi by the middle of January.
A Colonel Macdonald asserts that there is
v. misapprehension as to tho re-enlistments
i.. the lMrst Regiment. He maintains that
the regiment is stronger tnnn it was im
niedia ely after the reorganization, and
that it is gaining, rather than declining
in strength. Apart from the strength in
numbers, the Colonel contends that there
is a vast improvement in the material
now eulisting. Officers are working to-
:ether in harmony, and the enlisted men
ire taking a deep interest in the welfare of
.he organization.
Thirty members of the Signal Corps,
inder command of Lieutenant Phil Per
iins. all in fatigue uniiorm, left the
irmory on Ellis street yesterday morn
ng at 0 o'clock for a mounted practice
iril J. The signalers presented a tine ap
pearance, each naviug secured a first-class
lorse. They rode west and turned into
Point Lobos avenue, continuing until the
ocean boulevard was reached.
The march was then to a point on the
beach near where the road leads to Inele
9ide, and there the members of the corps
w^re drilled for more tnan an hour; and,
while the evolutions were very commend
able, the drizzling rain interfered in a
measure with the comfort of the men.
After a rest and lunch the corns sprang
into the saddle again, rode to Ingle-dde,
from there along tho Alms iouse road ann
through Golden Gate Park to the armbry,
arriving there at 3:30 o'clock.

The Cook That Suited-
Some time ago a lady advertised fora
cook, and many applied for the situation.
Owinc to her fastidiousness, however,
none of them seemed to suit her require
ments, until at the eleventh hour a
Bridget {from the Emerald Isle) also made
application, and was put to the test.
Mistress â Are you able to do plain cook
ing?
Bridget â The plainer the hotter for me,
ma'am.
Mistressâ Now look here, Bridget, my
husband likes his meat boiled, and I like
mine roasted. You understand?
Bridget â Yes, ma'am.
Mistressâ Now if I give you a fowl to
cook for dinner, how wou:d you do?
Bridget (thought:ully) â I wud roast it
first, ma'am, and you could ate your share,
thin I wouid boil what you left for the
masther.
He Designed the Capitol.
An architect dies and passes away from life and time, and if no burial trile
marks the place of his sepulture the work of his hand and brain exists after him,
and the great ediiices filled with the living are the enduring monuments to his
memory. So will be remembered William Mooser, the pioneer builder of
this City, who died at his late residence, 2709 Pierce street, late Friday night.
He was born at Geneva, Switzerland, 62 years ago and came to this State Oc
tober 10, 1854. Having studied architecture in his native land he fonnd
among the houseless sand dunes of Yerba Buena a field for his genius and the
yonng man began to build and builded well, for a great city has grown, like the
fabrics of a genii, from his handiwork. Sir. Mooser's first labor was a brick
house that stands facing South Park. He not only drew the designs and
superintended the construction, but made the material that went into the
walls, and did the carpenter work with his own hands. Then rapidly followed
a number of other buildings in different parts of the City, among which are
Metropolitan Hall, the Cosmos Club, the big woolen mills at North B^ach,
and later on the splendid new French Hospital in Richmond District. A few
months ago he competed for the honor of drawing the designs of the muni
cipal building to be erected on the site of the old City Hall, and won the sec
ond prize. Ihe Macdonough Theater in Oakland was designed by the dead
architect. In 1860 lie drew the first complete map of A'amsda Couaty and a
few years later assisted in designing the noble Capitol at Sacramento.
For some time he suffered from kidney troubles and gradually sank until
death ended his busy life-work. He leaves a widow and six children, William
Jr., Charles E., Joseph H., Louis H., Albert H., and Alice. William Jr. is
also an architect and was connected in business with his father in his life
time. The luneral will tate place from 2709 Pierce street this morning at 10
o'clock-

SHOOTING FOR BEST BTJLLSEYES
The Blanding Trophy Causes a
Spirited Rivalry in the
Columbia Club.
It was a great day for the rifle and pistol
shooters at Shell Mound yesterday. From
9 o'clock in the forenoon until as late as
the targets could be seen there was a lively
rattle of muskets and sporting rifles inter
spersed with the spiteful crack ot the 22
-caliber pistols and rifles on the fifty-yard
range adjoining. Taken on a whole the
light was good. In the earlier part of the
day there was a stiff breeze from the west
thai kept the marksmen shifting there
wind gauges. The marksmen were the
Nationals, Veterans of the National Guard,
Independent Rill &, Germamas, San Fran
cisco Schuetzen Vereir., Norddevitschen
Verein and the Columbia Pistol and Rifle
Club.
The latter club held its regular monthly
medal and prize contests. As the end of
the year approaches the interest becomes
more intense, as there are a number of
valuable medals hanging in the air, so to
speak, which at present no one can lay
very much claim to. A. Strecker is in
the lead for the fine Unfred diamond
medal. Yesterday in three shots he
made 7, or an average of a two and one
third inch circle. On another re-entry in
the same match he made 10 points or an
average of three and one-third inches to
a shot. This pats him 11 points ahead of
F. O. Young. D. W. McLaughlin is a
close third and promises to pull deeper
into the contest now that he'has increased
the weight of his 38 Ballard by encasing
the barrel in a section of bicycle frame
tube. The medal is worth the effort.
The Glinderruann rifle medal filled the
; stand with muskets, and those who did
! not really enter into the competition did
j considerable practice for an effort before
; the season closes four weeks hence. There
is another reason for the practice. A St.
j Louis r.fle and pistol club, composed of
several hundred members, is carrying a
chip on its shoulder, and at the last meet
ing of the Colurobias the secretary was in
structed to see wh.it kind of an all-round
j match for fine rifle, musket, pistol and
revolver could be arranged.
On tho 50-yara pistol range the contests
I were even more exciting. The Blanding
; pistol medal, presented by Gordon Biaod-
I ing, is causing a deal of rivalry. Tne man
making the best ten scares of three shots
to each score takes the prize.
As it is a re-entrj' match, there are sev
eral who spend their entire time shooting
in this contest. When the target closed
last evening, Charlie Daiss was in the lead
on the total of ten scores with 66 points.
I His best score was 2, 1, Iâ4,1 â 4, which was a
I duplicate of one made by F. O. Yonng pre
viously. A. H. Pape is next highest, with
n total of 72, J. E. Gorman thircf, with 77,
F. C. Y'onng fourth, with 79.
There is no little interest in the 22-cali
ber rifle contest. In this Ed Hovey's ten

SHOT FOR A PURSE.
Wollmer Defeats Woenno by Sixty-
bevan Rlnps and Wins $20.
The ranges at Schuetzen Park would have
been altogether deserted yesterday after
noon had it not been for the private maich
between J. Woolmer and Emil Woenne of
the California Schuetzfn Club for a purse
of $20, which was decided in favor of the
former. His score was 318 rings out of
twenty shots, as against his opponent's
261.
Xhe match opened shortly before 3
o'clock and lasted a little over an hour.
August Hampel acted as referee, but, in
the absence of alt serious dispute, his po
sition was very much of a sinecure. The
day was an ideal one for shooting. The
light was equable and there was scarcely
any wind. Under sucl; auspicious circum
stances the comparatively poor scores
made would seem to indicate that both
men were a trifle nervous.
Woenne was undeniably in that condi
tion so disastrous to marksmen, seeing
that he ruined a performance of average
merit by firing no less than three wicies.
J. Wollmer, the former hero of a dead
center, is older and more seasoned; tiie
result, therefore, is no reflection upon
Woenne's ability. The latter is a promis-

ing cadet and will not consent to accept
yesterday's issue .as conclusive, but has
challenged Wollmer to azaiu tempt fate at
an early date. From the appended scores
it will be seen that Wollmer nearly re
peated his feat of two weeks aeo. His
ninth bullet went clean through the second
figure in the 25 ring:
J. Wollmerâ 9. 19. IS, 23/ 22, 13, 19 10,

14, 9, 0, 17. 23, 12, 0. 18, 4, 18, 10, 14-251.
Both the foregoing scores were beaten
by Hampel, the referee, and C. Peach, a
new member of the crub, though neither
Performance was on the programme. Mr.
i Hampel, however, intimated that such
| eminently favorable meteorological con
diiions deserved a more grateful recogni
tion on the part of C. S. C. marksmen
than had been accorued them, and forth
with made the following excellent scores,
which may be left to speak for them
selves: 19. 21. 23. 18, 19, 19, 18, 22, 18. 19,

PHILADELPHIA'S LOYALTY.
The Doctor ' Says an American Flag
Seemed to Hang From Every
Build
Rev. John Hemphill, pastor of Calvary
Presbyterian Church, occupied his pulpit
yesterday morning for the first time in
two months.
Dr. and Mrs. Hemphill returned last
week from a rather hurried irip to Europe.
The long juurney across the continent nnd
the Atlantic was made for private business
purposes only, but in his flying itinerary
Dr. Hemphill caught mental snapshots of
many beautiful and wonderful scenes
which he reproduces in vivid and enter
taining description.
"We went to New York by the old over
land route," the doctor said to a Call rep
resentative, "and stopped for a few days
in Philadeluhia, where I preached. I did
not occupy my oid church, but the doors
of that place of worship were closed in the
evening and the pastor and congregation
came to give their old minister a royal
welcome. Being a loyal American, who
believes in patronizing home industries, I
took the steamer Â±*aris of the American
line at New York. It was a speedy and
pleasant trip, just seven days being con
sumed.
"We immediately crossed the Channel
to Paris, where we stayed twelve days.
'We were fortunate in beini in Paris
when the Czar of the Russias was feted.
We were further fortunate in having a
balcony on the Champs Eiysees, where
the grand procession was at its best. We
were delighted to have Henry L. Dodue
and bis wife, oid California iriends, on the
balcony with us. Paris is always beauti
ful, and the Parisians have a hapt>y
faculty of decorating, so we saw it at its
best. It was a sight worth going all the
way to Paris to see.
"We crossed over to London and stayed
at the Cecil Hotel, one of the newest of
London's grrat hostelrics and owned and
controlled by an American syndicate.
"Paris and London are as unlike each
other as can be. Paris seems to me a toy
city. London is as solid and enduring as
the Rock of Gibraltar. Of the two I prefer
London.
"When I reached New York I found the
political pot boiling all over. The interest
in New \ork and Puiiadelphia was in-
tense. The gold procession in New York
on the Saturday preceding the election
was supberb. Philadelphia was a sight
never to be forgotten. An American flag
hung out of almost every building. I
counted fifty magnificent flags over the
Union League.
"We .'topped election day in Chicago.
The feeling there was very intense, yet
everything was quiet and orderly.
"On my journey I heard services and
preachers or all sons, but Joseph Parker
of the City Temple, London, was the great
est of them all. Although an Independent,
or what wouid be called a Congregational
ist here, he paid a glowing tribute to the
Archbishop of Canterbury, who had died
that day.
"1 am tired of globe-trotting," con
cluded the Doctor, "and I am ready to
settle down again to hard work. 1 '
AWAITING A MESSIAH.
An Apoitle of Apostles Predicts Dark
ness and Light.
Mr. Davenport, who announced himself
as an evangelist of the Catholic Apostolic
church, preached in Odd Fellows' Hall
last night on "Our Lord* Second Coming."
He comnjenced his discourse by saying
that he was not opposed to the orthodox
churches and ministers, but sustained
them. He was ODpoaed to all that tends
to divide tne church. He explained that
the second coming of Christ meant the re
turn oi the same man Jesus who was upon
the earth almost two thousand years aeo.
Almiehty God, he said, is about to allow
society ;o fall into confusion and disaster,
because men refuse to look to him and to
hi* son. Men will fall so low ti.at they
will be willing to turn for help to God, and
help will come in answer to the cry of
those who sen they have failed to help
themselves. The dark cloud which now
> threatens the world is to burst and sweep
away all institutions which oppose God,
making way for the coming of Christ, the
savior of the world.
The church is the instrument by which
Christ will help to rule the world. She
must suffer terribly, even to persecution,
in the great tribulation which is about to
try all men who dwell upon the earth, to
prepare her for her Savior's personal
presence.
Not only is a time of trouble and deso
lation close upon us, but there is a ray of
bright light God has sent help to the
church. He lias sent her an offer of help
and has commenced to reorganiza if. He
has restored the gifts of the Holy Ghost
and the office of apostle.
Mr. Davenport was very explicit that
he himself is not an apostle, but was sent
by restored apostles to declare to the
j eople of San Francisco that God has sen t
help to prepare for tho coniiug of our
Lord.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Now for business
Make the week lively.
Keep up with the procession.
Look out for California industries.
Make San Francisco a home martet for
home goods.
Now is the time to advertise for the holi
day trade, and don't you forget it.
Fatten your birds, Mr. Turkeyman ; we
all wish a rich feast this time.
Four more months of Cleveland clover
and then we get ready to make hay.
You promote your own welfare when
you promote that of yonr neighbor.
Speculate on the composition of McKin
ley's Cabinet all you please, but don't bet.
Read the news of the day and delight
yourself with the reports of reviving busi
ness.
In the revival of trade the home market
should give the preference to the home
worker.
All that California asks for now is a wet
winter. Everything else seems propitious
to prosperity.
Don't forget that California novelties
are about the best things you can send
home for holiday gifts.
There is going to be a gold mining boom
in California before long and mining
counties will be way up.
Many a Uryanite will De a McKinley
man before the next election. Prosperity
is a pretty good persuader.
The next McKinley tariff won't be
thrown down in a hurry, and the coming
prosperity will last a long time.
Thanksgiving football games will soon
be looming up as a town topic and politics
will be talked only on the side.
The Cuban crisis should open up this
week and show whether there is in it any
thing more than in a chestnut burf.
Cleveland found the Democratic party
divided and demoralized and will return
it to its old leaders in the same condition.
Olney has about four months left in
which to put his vigorous foreien policy
into play and let the people see it work
once.
With money circulating and work in
creasing there will be good reason for
everybody to rejoice in the holidays this
season.
It would be money in the pockets of the
people to revive the crusade against the
sale of lottery tickets and those who ad
vertise them.
Bryan Democrats and Palmer Demo
crats have a big crow to pick with one an
other before they are ready for Thanks
â  giving turkey.
Eastern people will please take notice
that if they start West at once they can
have strawberries for Thanksgiving with
out extra charge.
California should loot toward the Pa
cific for her trade and every Cahfornian
in Congress should do his best to encour
age the upbuilding of our merchant ma
rine.
McKinley has an abundance of able sup
porters from amone: whom to select his
Cabinet, and it goes without saying he
will form one of the best known to our
history.
That spirit of local patriotism which de
lights in promoting home industry should
assert itself now in ail parts of California.
We have been importing too many goods
that could be manufactured at home and
the time has come to make a change.
With a strong and vigorous man in the
office of Secretary of State the McKinley
administration ought to be able to clean
up all our outstandingdiijlomaticdisput.es
and bring about nn international agree
ment for the free coinage of silver without
much delay.
Tbe Bryanites are deceiving themselves
if they expect to make another campaign
on the silver question. Long before the
end of McKinley's term the Republican
party will have settled the finances of the
Nation on a basis so solid that the whole
country will be satisfied.
The war in Cuba has come to be a con
test of endurance rather than of fighting
ability, and hard as it has been on the
Cubans it seems to have been almost as
disastrous to the Spaniards. The army
and navy and the treasury of Spain are
Dearly worn away, and that once strong
and still proud country is to-day but little
better off than Turkey.
Speaking of tbe infamous methods pur
sued by the New York Journal and the
Examiner the San Francisco Argonaut says:
"From the very beginning of the cam
paign the methods of these two papers
have been indefensible. There was no
party slander too mean, no campaign
calumny too vile for them to publish.
There was no caricature too coarse, no
cartoon too indecent for them to print."
Every good man and every good woman
in California will indorse these brave, true
words.
NOW FOR BUSINESS.
; List week we closed up politics. This week
! we begin business. The holiday trade will
soon engage the attention of everybody.
Tke windows of the stores along the streets
I are already brigtit with the novelties in
â¢ tended for the coming Christmas. The
people feel more cheerful than they have
for years, and a new activity as well as
I a new hope is visible in all the channels of
business.
The holiday trade, however, will be but
an episode in the great revival that has
begun. It will serve only as a preliminary
to the far mightier activity that will begin
to move the industries, the energies and
the enterprises of the American people.
In every form of human undertaking,
from the construction of far-reaching rail
roads to the planting of small orchards,
there will be an onward movement this
winter.
Reports from all parts of the Union
show that the people of every State are be
ginning to feel the new impulse and are
making preparation for an expansion of
industry in the near future. In many
lines of work this expansion will begin at
once. In others it may have to wait until
the passage of a protective tariff bill,
which is to be confidently counted on
when McKinley and a Republican Con
gress enter upon office next March. Even
in those industries that are waiting there
i 9, however, a sense of confidence that
leads men to make preparations for the
expansion that is to come, and this work
of preparation will give employment to
many who have been without wages or
regular employment during the long years
of the Democratic depression.
While this stir of activity is making
itself manifest in all parts of the Cnion,
the people of California will not be idle.
No State in the Union has such vast un
developed resources as ours, and no pro
gressive State falls so far short of manu
facturing her raw material. We have,
therefore, better prospects and better in
ducements for entering with confidence
upon a revival of business than the people
of any other section of the country.
It will be our own fault if we do not profit
by the advantages given to us by nature
and the opportunities to be afforded by
wise lecislation. It is that thought which
should be uppermost in our minds as we
begin the work of this first week in a new
era of prosperity. Let each man resolve
to do his share in the work of upbuilding
the State, and let him remember that
many great enterprises can be carried out
only by co-operation with his neighbors
of progressive spirit.
We must work together, as well as work
for ourselves. We must join unity of
action with our activity. We must lend a
helping hana wherever help is needed, and

THE CHANGING SOUTH.
Probably the last great political buttle
in the United States in which a South any
where near solid is to figure has been
fought and won. The great questions to
be discussed and decided by the American
people in the coming elections will be
economic ones in which patriotic South
erners will differ too widely to vote
all one way, and the dread of negro domi
nation will cease to be so overwhelming
as to prevent consideration of other issues.
The late election showed the shadow of
coming events. Many good Democrats
and true lovers of the South voted for Mc-
Kinley because they thought a settlement
of the financial agitation was the supreme
issue. Many other?, whose dislike to the
Republican party was too ingrained to
ailow them to vote for McKinley, simply
threw their votes away by casting them
for Palmer and Buckner. Differing views
about the expediency or honesty of the
unlimited coinage of silver at an arbitrary
ratio have already caused great fractures
to occur in the old tim*!-honorcd solidity.
These fractnres will widen into a complete
breakup when other questions come to the
Iront for study and settlement.
Protection will become, as it were, a
new question for the South because of the
rapid increase of manufacturing interests
within hei borders. The Government
ownership or complete control of railroads
will be one of the problems up for practi
cal solution in the near future, and about
this men will disagree without regard to
the section in which they live. Questions
as to what is the best banking system for
us and about the retirement of the green
backs, will also soon be live political
issues, and about these Southeners will be
unable to think and vote alike.
As an illustration of the break in the
old Southern unanimity may be cited the
remark oi a distinguished Georgian Judge,
made shortly before the election. He had
been a lifelong Democrat, but he consid
ered the financial plank in the last plat
form of that party so wild and such a
menace to the prosperity of the country
that he emphatically declared, "the good
God surely thought too much of this land
of ours 10 permit the election of Bryan. 1 '
So strong an expression from such a man
is a good indication of the temper of
many Southerners.
The South is traditionally conservative,
and though temporarily carried into the
ranks of, extreme radicals, will soon re
turn to her natural bent. When ques
tions are settled without the prejudices of
sectionalism, diÃcussion will be more com
plete and fair. Men will sooner arrive at
the ieeling they are arguing with iriends
and not with enemies, and this will make
truth and ideal government sooner at
tained.
HOME INDUSTRY.
This is the time to remember home in
dustries. This is the time to bear in mind
that California should be the best market
for California goods. This is the time for
every citizen to consider how he can best
promote the general welfare by promoting
the industry of his neighbor as well as
that of himself.
The coming decade should be one of
more than ordinary prosperity in Cali
fornia. It should see great progress made
m all lines of work. It should see citizens
combining and co-operating to establish
in various localities those large enter
prises which cannot be carried out by a
single individual. We ought during the
next ten years follow the plan of the
richer Eastern States aqd build a factory
by tbe farm. We should bring about a
diversified Industry. We should not only
produce raw material, but should manu
facture it to its final and most finished
form so that we can get for it tbe highest
price in the markets of the world.
Good prospects await the State. There
is everywhere evidence that we have men
of enterprise and capital among us
capable of being leaders of industry who
will accomplish success in their undertak
ings. Men of this stamp exist in almost
every community in the State, and if
their fellow-citizens will only give them
loyal support and active co-operation the
industrial system of California will be
virtually revolutionized within the de
cade.
We send our raw fruit to the East and
buy back jams and jellies. We send
abroad or destroy at home some of the

finest wood in the world and buy bacK
cabinet ware and even household furni
ture. We leave our quarries of fine stones
undeveloped and bring finished stonework
from abroad. 'We export leather and
wool and import shoes and clothing. We
even import meat, eggs and butter in a
State where the climate is perhaps better
fitted for the maintenance of dairies,
poultry farms and the raising of cattle
tnan any other in the Union if not in the
world.
In these and in a hundred other ways
we waste our substance while leaving our
resources undeveloped and our energies
unemployed. It is time to change this
condition of affairs. We must bear in
mind that the principle underlying the
great cause of protection is that of pro
moting home industry, and while we give
preference in our markets to American
goods over foreign goods by law we ought
to give preference in California to the prod
ucts of California industry by tb6 exer
cise of popular sentiment and individual
will.
THE STATE CAPITOL.
The biennial report of the Secretary of
State of California, which has just been
issued for the two fiscal years ending
June 30, 1890, recalls attention once more
to the bad condition of the State Capitol
and recommends several improvements
which he urges will not only better tne
building in many ways, but tend to econ
omy in its management and maintenance.
The Secretary says: "The building, for
the health of its inmates, should be ven
tilated, because when it was erected venti
lation was entirely ignored. The base
ment is never free from the foulest air
and many parts therein are as far from
light as Egyptian darkness." There is no
fire protection in the upper stories, and it
is said in the report: "If a fire should
start above the third floor of the building
and gain ordinary headway, the entire
building would De destroyed."
In addition to recommendations for im
proved ventilation, fire protection and
plumbing, the Secretary points ont several
means for maintaining the building with
greater economy than under the present
system. By the expenditure of a few
hundred dollars for two electric motors,
with attachments and pumps, it is claimed
that the elevator and pumps could be run
by electricity and a saving made to the
State of at least $2uOO annually.
The State row pays $600 for water u*ed
in tne building and $12,000 for water for
irrigating purposes. The Secretary thinks
that for $500 a well could be sunk which
would furnish all the water needed for the
building and grounds. The quantity of
fuel now used to heat the offices and
rooms by grates entails a large cost, and it
is believed the expense could be largely
reduced by substituting heaters.
The Secretary asserts: "With electric
motors in place, 1 will be able to save the
State in light and fuel within the building
more than $4000 a year. The sum is cer
tainly worth the saving and the plans sug
gested for the economy are all the more
worthy of consideration, since they
promise not only less expense, but greater
degree of security for the building and
comfort for its inmates."
Members-elect of the Legislature should
read the report with care and go to Sacra
mento with some knowledge of the prob
iem of the State Capitol, which will con
front them there. The building has long
been a subject of complaint, and something
should be done to make it a fit Capitol of
such a commonwealth as California.
THE MINING INDUSTRY.
The convention of the California Miners'
Association, which assembles in tins City
to-morrow, will be the first great indus
trial assembly in the State under the new
conditions produced by the election of
McKinley. The proceedings of the con
vention will therefore be followed Dy the
public with more than ordinary interest,
and it is safe to predict the attention given
will not go unrewarded.
The outlook; for no industry in the
Union is brighter than that for California
mining. Every feature of the situation is
encouraging. The demand for gold, al
ready great, will be increased by the ex
pansion of all forms of trade in tbe new
era of prosperity; improved scientific pro
cesses and new mechanisms enable miners
to work with profit ores that were unprofit
able before; men of capital and enter
prise in the great centers of wealth are
turning their thoughts to California as the
land where gold mining under tbe new
conditions promises the best results, and
as a consequence, the gold-yielding coun
ties of the State have the prospect of a
coming prosperity borne forward by the
triple force of increased demand, im
proved methods and enlarged capital.
The impulse of improvement has been
already felt, and every mining county in
the State will have good reports to make
of work accomplished or undertaken. The
convention will include many notable
men and in its entirety will truly repre
sent tbe energy and confidence of the
State in the coming of better times. San
Francisco will extend to them a most cor
dial welcome and will heartily co-operat2
with them in ajl they devise for the ad
vancement of their golden industry and
the welfare of California.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The improved naval ordnance of Great
Britain Is exemplified in the 12-lnch wire
wound breechloadlng rifles, which weigh only
forty-six tons and yet have the same penetrat
ing power as the 17-inch guns, weighing 110
tons, on the Sunspareil and Ben bow. Tae new
guns are being placed on the ships of the lla
jt-stic m.d Csesar class. â¢
Messrs. Yarrow & Co., the weli-known tor
pedo-boat builders on the Thames, are about to
establish a branch yard in (Jerniuny, and It is
their intention to gradually transfer their
business in England to the proposed new
worka, chiefly on account of the cheaper labor
in Germany.
The French naval programme lor the next
fiscal year has been proposed^ay the Govern
ment and approved by the budget Ministry. It
provides for one armored battle -ship of
11,270 tons, 28500-Uorsepower. triple screws
and a speed of 23 knots; one protected cruiser;
two coast-defense cruisers of 5500 tons,
17100-horsepower and 23 knots speed. One
third-class cruiser of about 2100 tons, oue
gunboat, one torpedo-boat destroyer and two
first-class torpedo-boats are likewise provided
for, and while the number of vessels to be built
is but small it is to be noted that in the pro
posed triple-screw battle-ship of 23 knots
France will have by all odds the most superior
fighting ship existing in any navy.
The Diadem, sheathed cruiser of 11,000 tons
displacement, was launched from the stocks
of the Fairfleld yard on October 21, which was
214 days after her keel was laid. This Is the
best record of ship-building for the British
navy.
The French Superior School, instituted a
few montns ago on tftree cruisers in the Med
iterranean, has been abandoned, and a school
will be opened in Paris for lieutenants of the
navy desirous oi becoming proficient in spe
cial branches connected with nnval warlare.
The school will be presided over by an ad
miral and wiil have a large corps of specialists
as teachers.
The Talbot on her trip across the Atlantic
from England to Halifax bad a narrow escape
from going down on October 3 during a hurri
cane. Her spars came down and the captain
narrowly escaped being killed. The sheet
anchor was lifted bodily from its place and
shifted over on the turtle-back deck. Several
of the boats were smashed in the davits and
serious leaks developed under the gun plat
forms.
The Powerful, British cruiser of 14,000 tons
and 25,000 horsepower, has not yet concluded
her trials. The eight hours' full power trial
on October 21 had to come to a ciose after two
hours' trial owing to an eccentric strap break
ing and a gauge pipe oursting. The mean
horsepower developed during the two hours
was 24,700. During the prior thirty hours'
coal consumption trial at sea the horsepower
developed was 18,433, with 103 revolutions,
and the coal expended, as taken from actual
weight, was at the rate of 1838 pound 3 per
horsepower per hour.
The Bwordfish, torpedo-boat destroyer re
cently completed for the British navy, made
a speed on her trial of 3/7.12 knots, with 203
pounds of steam, 399 revolutions and 4570
horsepower. The contract called for 27 knots
on 4000 horsepower.

"EXAMINER" METHODS.
">o Caricature 2\>o Coarse, Ao Cartoon
Too indecent."
San Francisco Argonant, Nov. 9.
Among the many gratifying things in
this election, not the least is the utter dis
comfiture of the kind of journalism prac
ticed by the New York Journal and San
Francisco Examiner. From the very be
ginning of the campaign, the methods of
those two papers have been inde ensible.
There was no party slander too mean, no
campaign calumny too vile for them to
publish. There was no caricature too
coarse, no cartoon too indecent for them
to print. Their attacks on McKinley,
Hanna, Reed and other leading Republi
cans have been so vicious and so vile that
they have made even Democrats ashamed.
That they have been a power in the recent
campaign cannot be deniedâ but it was a
power that worked the reverse way. They
made thousands of votes for the Republi
cans by their ruffianly methods. San
Francisco generally coes Democratic, but
under the influence of the Examiner she
went for McKinley. Mr. Hearst came out
of the West to regenerate New York and
instill into her pure Democracy and free
silverism. New York always goes sweep
ingly Democratic, but under the influence
of Mr. Hearst's Democratic teachings and
new journalistic methods, she went
sweepingly Republican. If Mr. Hearst
wants to be a power in journalism, we ad
vise him to change his methods.
BACKING UP ADVERTISE
MENTS.
Why Three-Tenth* of the Advertising
fails.
Business men as a rule expect too much of
their advertising. Advertising by itself does
not sell goods. It is simply the connecting
link between buyer and seller. When it has
brought the customer to the door its work is
done. If the prospective buyer is not well
looked after when he reaches the store the ad
vertising will show loss.
There ia no factor more important in trade
than the salesman. A careless, ten-dollar-a
week salesman can kill the effect of thousands
of dollars* worth of ihe very best advertising.
I know of half a dozen stores in this City
who are continually advertising "tremendous
bargains," "genuine values," etc. When a
customer inquires for any of the articles ad
vertised the clerk will first make a determined
effort to sell something higher-priced. If per
sistently arced he will anally show the arti
cles, but with a remark that the goods are of a
very poor quality, would not suit the pur
chaser, etc. Should the customer insist upon
purchasing the cheap article, the disgust of
the clerk ia apparent, and tee buyer is made
to feel that it was something to be ashamed of
to desire to purchase any thiug cheap.
Xot long since I was in a store watching the
progress of a special sale. Piled upon a coun
ter near the dcor were a number of articles of
wearing apparel, slightly damaged, which had
been that day advertised. A prospective buyer
who had been attracted by the advertising
came in and stood looking over the articles for
some moments, then stepping over to the floor
walker, he asked if they Lad any similar arti
cles not damaged at about the same price. The
question, a periectly civil and reasonable one,
was received as though it conveyed a deadly
insult, and the flippant answer, "Of course
not; do you want the earth?" was hardly sat
isfactory to the would-be customer, and of
course he turned away never to return.
I know a man who went into a shoestore in
this city lust week, where three clerks were
"busy" (?) telling lunny stories in the rear.
After waiting for five minutes, one of the
clerks came forward and asked if anything
was wanted. While the "trying on" process
Whs in progress, a friend of the clerk's came in
and the customer was left to his own reflec
tions for another five minutes, while social
topics were discussed by the "friends." This
man told me that no amount of advertising
would ever induce him to trade in that store
agaiu.
These are not Isolated instances; dozens of
similar cases could be named.
We read many advertisements which invite
us in beautiful language to "come in and look
around without thought of buying." Well,
now, you try that in San Francisco, and I will
guarantee that la the majority of cases if you
say you are "just looking 'round," you will be
treated like an interloper and made to feel
like one; and should your examination of
goods cause you to ask for information or as
sistance you will be made to feel "welcome
ana at home" by attention so grudgingly be
stowed that it borders on insult, to state it
mildly. And this is not an exaggerated state
ment, but a cold, bare fact.
Another point which militates greatly
against successful advertising is the, gener
ally, absolute indifference of clerks to the sub
stance of tbe firm's advertisements. Suppose
an advertisement brings a reader to the store;
he Bsks a pertinent question about the article
advertised. Should the salesman not be quick
and decisive with his answer, but hesitate or
possioly go to another salesman for help, he
immediately creates a suspicion in the mind
of the wouid-be buyer that the promises of the
advertisement are not to be carried out.
Salesmen should be constantly in touch with
the advertising of the firm they represent.
Nor are these drawbacks the only features
that advertising is looked to to overcome. 1
am frequently asked by business mea why re
tail advertising in San Francisco is not pro
ductive of as quick returns as in other cities.
I believe we have not far to go to find the rea
son. We are simply suffering from an over
dose of "faking. 11
Time was, and not very long ago, when the
extravagant expressions "cost," ''below cost,"
"half price," etc., were the key to crowded
houses. Then the advertising was strictly
carried oat in the store. But unscrupulous
people took advantage of their neighbors' suc
cess und as soou as business was dull made
haste to put a "sale" ad in the paper and a
"sale" sign over the door, then sat down in
their offices to watch the "suckers" come in.
The prices in tbe store were not changed, and
in many instances eveu the window prices
were left the same.
Prices are published to-day with values at
tached that would have astonished Us several
years ago. Now they create scarcely any com
ment. People have learned from Bitter experi
ence that something cannot be given, and is
not given, for nothing. The consequence is
that faith in all advertising has been shaken.
The-legitimate merchants are suffering with
the "fakers." If people do not believe adver
tisements they will not answer them.
The remedy, I think, is to cut loose from
tremendous adjectives, come down to ordinary
every-day language aud to tell absolutely
nothing but the truth. That famous Abe Lin
coln-ism is as true to-day as the day it was
utteredâ "No success can be lasting that is not
established on a solid basis."
Clement Wildeb.

A Bjll op Saleâ A. F., City. If a person pur
chases a place of business he is not required to
have the bill of sale recorded at the Recorder's
office, but he ran do so lor his own security in
case of loss of the original. The fact that such
a bill is not recorded does not bind the pur
chaser to pay the debts contracted by the
former owner of the business.
Amount of Legal Tenderâ H. D., City. A
merchant cannot refuse to accept standard
dollars to any amount in payment of a bill of
goods sold, unless at the time ot the sale he
stipulated that the payment should be made
in gold. In this country a merchant Is not re
quired to receive coppers in payment of a bill
when the amount tendered exceeds 25 cents.
Lithographyâ S. P. S., Winters, Yolo County,
Cal. There are several lithographic establish
ments in the City of San Francisco, but this
department will not advertise them. Had
this correspondent signed his name, instead of
only his initials, he would have received an
answer by wail, but he, like others who are
afraid to sign their names to letters of inquiry,
must not feel disappointed if the information
asked for is not furnished.
Docksâ H. P. W., Seattle, Wash. The dry
dock at Hunters Point, fau Francisco, will
admit vessels of 22}^ feet draught. The Mer
chants' drydock (floating) will receive vessels
that have a draught of sixteen feet; the dock
at the Union Iron Works will receive vessels
of seventeen feet draught. There is no dry
dock at the Fulton Iron Works. The only
other floatins dock in the bay of San Fran
cisco besides the Merchants' is' the one at the
Union Iron Works.
Casinoâ o. S. H., Nevada City, Cal. The
rule in casino Is that a player cannot ouild
from the table. For instance: If a seven and
two are upon the table and a player puts an
ace upon them calling it eight, his opponent
cannot employ another two upon the table to
build it up to ten. If A and C are partners
and A plays a card and makes a build 01" four
teen, B his opDonent plays a six, C, who is A's
partner, cannot take that six and place it ou
an eight on the table aud call it fourteen.
El Doradoâ Questioner, Ignacio, Marin
County, Cal. El Dorado (Spanish) has been ap
plied to man and place. It has been inter
preted to mean "the golden city." Milton in
"Paradise Lost" says :
Ouiana, whose great city Greyson's sons
Call "JSI Dorado."
Tbe Muysca Indians of Bogota called each
new chief an l< Ei Dorado." It was customary
among those people at the time of the explora
tions in the sixteenth century for each new
chief, with his nnked body anointed with res
inous gums and covered' with gold dust, to
head a solemn procession to the Lake of Go
vita and to wash himself therein after much
impresMve ceremony. At the same time the
assembled savages cast into tbe lake gold
trinkets and precious stones, as offerings to
the Koddess of the lake, the drowned wife of a
former chieftain. The Spaniards applied the
name to any place that was supposed to be
fabulously rich in KOld, and they searched at
various times for an El Dorado in South Amer
ica, Mexico aud Florida in the United States.
Moneyâ E. G. S., Lrvermore, Cal. A check is
a written order for money drawn on a bank or
private banker or bank cashier, payable to a
person named or to his order or to bearer. In
legal effect it in a bill of exchange. A certified
check is one that has been recognized by a
competent officer of a bank as a valid appro
priation of tbe amount of mouey specified
therein to the payee ana bearing the evidence
of such recognition. Notes issued by a Gov
ernment are recognized as money. Walker,
in his work on "Political Economy,' l
says: "Money is the medium of .ex
change. Whatever performs this func
tion or does this work, is money, no matter
what it is made of, and no matter how it came
to be a medium at first, or why it continued to
be such." In another work, "Money, Trade
and Industry," Walker says tha; mouey "is
that which passes freely from hand to hand
throughout the community in tinaldischarge of
debts and full payment for commodities, being
accepted without reference to the character or
credit of the person who offers it and without
the intention of the person who receives it to
consume it or enjoy it or apply it to any other
use than ir turn to tender it to others in dis
charge of debts or puyment (or commodities "'
The check of a private individual is an order
for money. When it is that of an individual
known to have a credit or balance at a solven t
bank and is used in payment of debts or the
purchase of commodities it is money. A check
not honored by payment is not money.
LADY'S SEVEN-GORED SKIRT.
The slight change in skirts consists of a nar
rowing of the front gore, and a decided mass
ing of the fullness ill back folds, the sides
beine very smooth at top, but flaring well, as
they have for some time past.
The one shown here has a front gore, one
side gore and four back gores, which are laid
in small box pleats at the top, or gathered,
making in all seven gores.
Plain skirts still predominate, though trim
ming is undoubtedly used.
Braiding at the sides of front breadth, or set
crosswise ut the foot of the iront breadth, ex
tending up the seams, is more used than any
other style, but bands of braid around entire
skirt are used, as well as braiding in pointed
designs taping toward the top, at every seam.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS
Rev. S. F. Moore, a Presbyterian missionary
In Korea during the last four years. Is at iho
Occidental Hotel with his wife and two srhnll^
children, en routs for nis old home in Chicaeo, 4 *^
having arrived here Saturday night on the Rio
from the Orient. "The work of the Christian
missionaries In Korea is very encouraging,"
said he yesterday. "The Chino-Japan war haÂ«
proved a help rather than a nindrance to the
spread of Christianity. The Korean Govern
ment lias passed some laws doing away with
the worship of idols, and has caused the de
struction ol certaiu wayside places of wor
shipâpiles of stones and other monumentsâ
where the natives were wont to observe their
heathen rites, and where sorcerers prayed. Fe
male sorcerers have been forbidden to con
tinue business. The King is a progressive man,
and missionaries are permitted to preach all
over the country. Little congregations are
springing up here and there right along, but
there is still a great deal of heathenism left.
More advance has been made in the last two
years than in all the time preceding, for
Protestant missionaries have been in that
country but twelve yenrs. The Roman Catno
lies have been established there 100 years, and
they claim 80,000 converts. The Koreans are
perhaps more intelligent and receptive than
the Chinese, but ancestral worship is supreme
with them, and that is why it is difficult to
wean them from idolatry. They believe that
the man who will not sacrifice for an ancestor
has lost his reason, and they assert that the
Korean who embraces Christianity has done
so because of some drue administered by the
missionaries, causing him to become Insane."
Rev. Mr. Moore will return to Korea in a few
months to resume his work.
ONE WEEK OF PRAYER.
livery T. M. C. A. in the World Observ
ing These Seven Days.
All over the world wherever there is a
Y. M. C. A. this week is known and ob
served as a week ot prayer in accordance
with a custom established just thirty years
ago and followed every year since then.
Yesterday afternoon the local association
began the seven days of prayerfulness by
assembling in the Y. M. 0. A. auditorium
to listen to afi address by the Rev. Dr.
Marshal of Chicago, field secretary of the
Board of Foreign Missions of the Presby
terian Church, and to music by the Moody
quartet.
Every night this week the young men
will meet in the Association hall, corner of
Ellis and Mason streets, at 8 o'clock and
devote the evening to prayer. To-night
and to-morrow night the Moody quartet
will be with them to furnish additional
music. All the churches in the City will
also unite with the Christian young men
in this week of prayer.
During a long discourse, made up of
reminiscences of noted foreign mission
aries and their work, Dr. Marshal held the
interest of a large audience. He was for
merly a well-to-do clergyman and made a
tour of the world, inspecting: foreign mis
sions at his own expense. He returned to
this country greatly impressed by what he
had seen and determined to devote his en
tire attention to that particular field of
Christian work. Since then he has trav
eled extensively in his official capacity
and is now here, lecturing in the different
Presbyterian churches to raise funds.
He said yesterday that the first Chris
tian missionary went to China in 1807,
and after twenty-seven years of constant
labor, aided by other missionaries, it was
estimated that there were then six Chris
tians in Cliina. so slow was the work of
converting a people steeped in idolatry
and the traditions of their ancestors.
There are now 70,000 baptized Chinese
Christians, several hundred" ordained Chi
nese ministers of the gospel of Christ and
Â«n ever increasing corps of Christian
teachers, an ever expanding system of
Christian schools where young Chinese
are being educated.

First Steamship of a New
Line Has Arrived
in Port.
The Amarapcora Has a Heavy
Cargo on Her First Com
peting Voyage.
CAPTAIN CAMERON'S YARN
Tbe Sealing Ship Glencona Drops
Anchor in Harbor 21 Days From
Yokohama.
It was misty and thick outside the
heads, and also inside, yesterday after
noon. A number of vessels which pre
ferred to square away for the Golden Gate
under sail instead of tying up to a tug
stood off shore waiting for clear weather
and favorable wind. Among these is the
bark Canada, which for the last twenty
four hours nas found safety in plenty of
sea room.
An arrival of widespread interest to the
Pacific Coast, as well as to the water front,
yesterday, was that of the steamship
Amarapoora, Captain Cameron, which tied
up at pier 27 at the foot of Lombard street
at 4 o'clock in tne afternoon. The Amara
poora represents the line to Central Amer
ican ports in opposition to the Hunting
ton steamers. Stie came in from Puget
Sound ports to finish her cargo, and from
the mountains of freight, comprising
everything from railroad freight cars to
boxes of crackers, piled up an the pier
shed she will be able to finish her cargo
all rig>it, and make the first trip, so iar as
cargo is concerned, a successful one. The
Amarapoora was put on this run to divide
the business and make the cold perspira
tion stand out on the strong box of the
Huntington liners.
The Amarapoora is a British tramp iron
steamer of leviathan proportions. She
looks built and equipped to ride any sea
stiffly and gracefully, broadside on, and
she looks big enough to ride tne turbu
lent ocean with hea i to the sea, as stately
and unshaken as Telegraph Hill. This
ship has never been into San Franci>co
harbor before, it is said. She put into
Puget Sound, hailing from Japan.
Captain Cameron's mental condition as
to Pacific Coast newspapers is in about
the tame state as cow's milk after a storm.
A sheet at Tacoma, with more respect for
enterprise than facts, published, soon
after Captain Cameron dropped anchor off
the foot of Pacific avenue, a story to the
effect that there had been a semi- mutiny
aboard the Amarapoora on the cruise from
the Flowery Kingdom, and that a part of
the crew was in irons. About this Cap
tain Cameron -an!:
"The story was totally false. I did not
read the newspaper, but I could not avoid
hearing about it. If I could nave pot hold
of the ruan who published that yafn I'd
hare keel-hauled him or knocked him
into a cocked-hat. A day or two later
when one of them asked me how big this
ship is, I told him she was four miles
long, her speed 150 miles an hour and that
she carries nothing but gold and silver."
Then the captain cnuckied softly to him
self, and added that tbe Amarapoora has
accommodations for forty cabin passen-
gers.
The British ship Glencona, Captain
Lynn, seventy-one oaya from Singapore,
was towed in yesterday afternoon. She is
in ballast and consigned to E. C. Evans.
While coming in Captain Lynn read in a
newspaper about the ship Ar.delana maK
ing the passage from Yokohama in
twenty-four days, which is coupidered
very fast time for a sailer.
He claimed to have beaten the Andelana
out of sight, stating that twenty-one days
ago he was off Yokohama. Captain Lynn
neglected to get a bill of health at Singa
pore, and there will on that account be
some delay at least in his entering the
Custom-house here. Health Officer Dr.
Blue said yesterday that he found the
ship ail right, and that he could give the
captain a pratique. Subsequently the
captain must settle with the Collector of
Customs.
The ship L. G. Burgess will go to Oak
land to-day. She will De tbe first ship to
tie up at the new coal bunkers up Oakland
creek.
Thomas P. Ryan, a politician and ex
corporal of the police lorce of this City
who was stationed on the water front for
a nutiib.fr of years, died of heart failure
November 1, and was buried from his late
residence, 160J Mission street, last Tues
day in Hoiy Cross Cemetery. He was 50
years old, and resided in this City since he
was a small boy. A widow an.i six chil
dren, one son and five daughters, sur
vive him.
NO VALUABLES FOUND,
Mysterious Disapp2arance of
Mr. Seeligsohn's Watch
and Diamonds.
But the Autopsy Shows Asphyxiation
by Submersion and No Mark
of Violence.
Some myterious circumstances sur
rounding the death of the young attorney,
Michael Seeligsohn, whose body was
found floating in the bay uear Goat Island
laÂ«t Saiurday evening by yachtsmen, yet
remains to be cleared up.
The young man habitually wore a dia
mond ring, a diamond stud, and carried a
gold watch and chain. When the body
was recovered all that was found on it
was a pocket-knife, two white metal cases
and one or two other pocket trinkets. He
was also known to have a sum of money.
The fact that all the valuables are missing
supports the claim of the family and
friends of the deceased that he met with
foul play.
Last evening Mr. Simon, his brother-in
law, and Abe Seeligsohn, bis brother, re
fused to see reporters or further discuss
the case. It was stated for them that there
were no new developments in the case.
The autopsy was held yesterday at the
Morgue by Autopsy Physician Morgan. It
showed asphyxiation by submersion.
There were no visible marts of violence
on the body. The Dody has been in the
water such a length of time that it would
be difficult to hnd such marks. The
Morcuo officials are still inclined to think
the case was one of suicide. One of the
main facts to support thi- theory is that
the pockets of the clothing of the deceased
were found loaded with rocks, apparently
for the purpose of insuring singing.
The rooms of the deceased at 309 Powell
street have not yet been searched. No
letters, however, were left there by the
young attorney. Mr. Cobnreich, the pro
prietor, said last evening that Seelizsohn
was m good circumstances, usually in
good spirits, a young man of fine charac
ter, not given to dissiDation, and . that it
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1896.
â was impossible for him to believe he com
mitted suicide.
Dr. Trask, who treated Sepligsohn for a
hoarseness of the voice, says he was incor
rectly reported by a morning paper in
making him say that he had noticed aber
ration of mind in the young attorney.
THE CITY THEATERS.
There Will Be Many Attractions for
Those Who Want to Go to the
Playhouses To-Xight.

said to be very effective, and while tearful

At Morosco's Grand Opera-house there
will be offered a patriotic play called "The
Minute-men of 1774 and 1775," ir. which
Victory Buteman will appear, supported
by Leslie Morosco, who has always been a

Tivoli Opera-house will offer its patrons
to-night. Lilly Post is cast for the char
acter of Safti, the gypsy girl, and Rhys
T.omts will take the part of Sandor Ba
rinicay, an exile (the Baron).
Among the many attractions to be of
fered at the Orpheum to-night there is one
from Europe known as "The Lavater Hog
Orchestra," the Quaker City Quartet, Nel
son, Ginseretti and Delmonico, acrobats,
and a number of other specialty artists.
Arion, who rides a trolley wire at night
many feet above the ground, ia still the
attraction at the Chutes. The skating
rink that has been opened but a week ia
well patronized and is a splendid place for
all who are fond of roller skating.
Professor Kennedy, the mesmerist, or
hypnotist, as be is called, will give one of
his laugh-making exhibitions at the Bush
street this evening. Whatever may be
thought of the result of Kennedy's linger
ing of bis subjects, it is amusing.
At the Baldwin Theater next Friday
afternoon Messrs. Hinrichs and Beel will
give their final symphony concert, nt
which will be rendered numbers by Gade,
Tschaikowsky, Macdowell, Bach-Aibert,
fcvensden, etc.

LUTHER'S ANNIVERSARY.
Rev. Oliver C. Miller Â«>f the Church of
the Holy Spirit on the Reformer.
Yesterday the four hundred and thir
teenth anniversary of the birth of
Martin Luther was observed in an appro
priate manner at the Lutheran Church of
the Holy Spirit, Jackson street near
Buchanan. Rev. Oliver C. Miller preached
an appropriate sermon on the life of the
great icformer. He quoted Luther as say
inp that the strength of a nation was not
in its armies and Jortifications, but in the
integrity and uprightness of the people.
He s.iiu that Luther belonged to all
Christendom and he himself sorrowed
that his own name should bo given to any
particular church. The Augsburg confes
sion had become the basis of all the Prot
estant churcnes and could not possibly ad
mit of that narrow interpretation eiven it
by some zealous Lutherans and higo
churchmen.

DEATH FROM A FALL.
Mr*. Catherine Quigley Dies From
Injuries Received Last Wednesday.
Mrs. Catherine Quigley, a widow 65
years of age, died in' her home, 7 Verona
street near Third, from the result of in
juries sustained in a iall down a flight of
stairs last Wednesday. Dr. Rottanzi was
called to attend the injured woman, and
at first it was thought she would recover.
She had sustained serious internal in
juries, however, and all treatment proved
without avail. The case was reported to
the Coroner's office, but as death resulted
solely from the result of the accident an
inquest was waived.
MANY YEARS IN SERVICE
Twenty-Filth Anniversary of
the San Francisco
Fusileers.
The Quarter of a Century Veterans
Were Presented With Tokens of
High Esteem.
The twenty-fifth anniversary, banquet
and ball of the San Francisco Fu?ileers'
Mutual Benefit Fund was held on Friday
evening at California Hall. The San
Francisco Fusileers, Second Itesiment of
Infantry, N. G. C, was organized on No
vember 6, 1871. On June 1, 1881, it was re
organized as the San Francisco Fusileers,
Battery C, Second Regiment of Artillery,
N. G. C. Again on December 7, 1895, an
other change took pJace and the old com
pany became the San Francisco Fusileers,
Company I, Sixth Infantry Batallion, N.
G. C. The last change was made two
days after the last date and the body be
came simply Company 1, First Infantry
Regiment, N. G. C.
Through all these changes the members
have held together and several years ago
they formed a beneficiary auxiliary to the
body known as the Mutual Benefit Fund.
It is the custom to meet once a year and
have a pood time as In former days and
such was the nature of the last anniver
sary reunion. At the banquet table every
thing that could tempt the appetite was
to be found. The opening remarks were
made by Major A. Huber and the toast
"The Steamship Fearless" was responded
to by Captain L. Siebe. Charles Thier
bach responded to "The Benefit Fund"
anl Major Charles Boxton to "The
Ladies."
There was a delightful treat in store for
a number of the old veterans, those who
had served in the company for tbe full
twenty-five years. Th-se w'ers Captain L.
Siebe. Lieutenant David Schoenfieid, Her
man Paulsen, D. Duuker, Charles Thier
bach, D. Behrens. John Hoss, August
Brume and John D, Siebe.
Kach was presented with a beautiful
gold watch charm emblematic of the Fu
sileers. Major Charles Boxton was also
well remembered. He was presented with
a beautiful sword, belt and spur?. After
tbe presentation and the banquet the com
pany and its guests en joyed a dance, which
lasted until a late hour. The affair was
under the direction of the following gen
tlemen:

STRICKEN WITH APOPLEXY.
Death of Judge Krwin T. Cage at the
Keceiving Hospital.
An old gentleman was picked up on
FranKlin and Sacramento streets Friday
night by Policeman Charleston. He was
in a dazed condition. He was sent in the
patrol wagon to the City Prison, where he
cave hia name as Erwin T. Case, an attor
ney.
As he did not seem to recover, Serjeant
Bidwell sent him to the Receiving Hospi
tal Saturday morning, and it was at once
seen that he was suffering from a stroke
of apoplexy. He died yesterday morning.
The deceased was an ex-judge and lived
at 1723 Clay street. He was 57 years of
&ne and leaves a son, who is an attorney,
and two daughters, one a physician and

WILL LIGHT THE
PARK BY NIGHT
The Means to Be Furnished
Out of This Year's
Appropriation.
A New Cross Road From Point
Lobos Avenue to ths
South Drive.
PLANTING MADRONE AND HOLLY
Many Swimmers in November â An
Aeronaut Who Went Up in
a Drizzling Rain.
There is more than a probability that a
portion of this year' 3 appropriation for
Golden Gate Park will be used for the
purpose of lighting the park with elec
tricity. There has been a demand for
such an improvement for about two years
and the matter has been under considera
tion for some time. Those interested ad
vanced so far in the matter that last week
they requested Superintendent McLaren
to communicate with the officials of the
principal parks in the East for the pur
pose of obtaining from them the fullest
information on the subject of park illu
mination. Letters have been sent and
when the information is at hand all the
methods will be carefully studied, and it
is likely that the one offering the greatest
advantages will be adopted. As yet the
Commissioners are undecided as to
whether the arcs should be illumined all
night or only during the early hours.
A new crossroad has been built and two
irregular ones that were laid out in the
long ago have been closed. .Thenewone
commences at D street and Twenty-fourth
avenue, which is west of the prayer-book
cross, and, traversing the part, leads to
the southern drive. This new road con
nects on the north with Point Lobos ave
nue. The ones that have been closed were
transverse roans east of the new one, and
led by irregular lines to the western end
of the JaKe. The winding path from I)
street and Seventeenth avenue that leads
to the boathouse is still opeo.
in the immediate vicinity of the new
road a section of the park will soon be
planted with madrone and California
holly, and when these trees, which have
for six years been growing in the propa
gating section, are transplanted aad at
tain a fair height they will, with their
bright foliage, dark bark and carmine ber
ries, prove an added attraction. It is a
remarkable fact that these trees do not
commence to develop to any extent until
after they have attained the sixth year of
growth.
The day after the election there was
sent to the park zoo a magnificent deer,
bearing a card on which was written in
bold letters, "William McKinley."
During the early part of the "day there
were a good many people in the park, but
whpn it commenced to drizzle at 3 o'clock
in the afternoon, there was a hasty de
parture from ail sections for the nearest
car lines.
There was a large number of visitors to
the conservatory to view the beautiful dis
play of chrysanthemums, which were in
full bloom and appeared to better advan
tage than on the previous Sunday.
The reopening of the museum has again
been postponed *.o a time not yet deter
mined upon, in consequence of the non
arrival of special locks to be used in clos
ing the many new cases in which a great
number of exhibits have been installed.
The number of visitors to the ocean
beach was unusually small, owing to the
weather, but the mnjoritv of those who
did go went into the bathsi" and the swim
mers were not few. Up to 3 o'clock 863
individuals, in addition to those holding
commutation tickets, indulged in tank
swimming â not a bad showing for the love
of salt sea bathing in November. A 12
-inch pipe is to be placed in the interior of
the baths for the purpose of forcing hot
air through it, so as to maintain an even
temperature of 74 degrees. On very warm
days cold air will be forced through this
pipa to reduce the temperature. Last
Saturday, the first day that the baths were
thrown open free to the school children,
161 public school pupils were admitted to
view tne wonders in the big building.
Despite the unpleasant day there were
many people at the Cuutes, and the per
formance outdoor and indoor went on as
on a clear sunshiny day. Arion showed

AN ACTION TO
BREAK A WILL
The Estate of Carlton C.
Coieman Now in the
Courts.
Charges That He Was of Un
sound Mind aDd Unduly
Irfluenced.
MUCH PHOPEBTY INVOLVED.
Grave Complications That Aff j et the
Interests of a Boy New
Twelve Years Old.
A case of unusual interest is soon to be
heard in the Probate Court. The interest
lies iiot only in tbe fact that a large and
valuable estate is in controversy, but also
in the prominence of the parties whose
names are involved in the action. It is a
contest of the will of the late Carlton
Chirm Coieman by Mrs. Edith Bianding
Coieman on behalf of her 12-year-old sou,
William Tell Coieman.
Many years ago C. C. Coieman, son of
the Jate William T. Coleraan, led Miss
Edith Bianding to the altar, and the fruit
of that union was tbe boy wno now figures
in this case. The marriage did not prove
to be what was expected and desired, for
several years ago the couple were legally
separated, the minor son being awarded to
tt-e mother, who secured her part of the
communiiy property.
C. C. Coieman went to reside with his
mother. Mrs. Carrie M. P. Coieman, and
after a long illness he died on October 19,
1895. Deceased left an estate in United
S.aies bonds and equally good securities
valued at about $55,000, after all his debts
were paid. In his will he disposed of his
property in a peculiar manner. Unuer iis
provisions the Union Trust Company was
made ihe executor. Tbe latter was only
to allow the boy $100 per month until he
was 21 years* of age. From that time un
til he was 30 y ; ars oM the young man
could only draw the interest or rever.ue
from the estate.
If the lad died before he reached his
thirtieth year the entire property was to
go to his (deceas d's) mother, Mrs. Wil
liam T. Coieman. Matters became badly
complicated by the death of Mrs. W. T.
Coieman on May 6 of thisyear, and by her
will she left most all of present and pros
pective estates to her son, Robert L. Cole
man. Her estate was appraised al about
$400,000. Her estate aho was left in the
hands of th â¢ Union Trust Company, and
she set a?-ide about $55,000 for her grand
son, William T. Coieman, under precisely
the same conditions as the father â that
the lad should have an allowance, but
tiiat in the event of his death before his
thirtieth year the entire estate should go
to Robert L. Coieman.
Mrs. Edith B. Coieman. in her contest
that was filed yesterday, pays no attention
to tbe will of ber boy's grandmother, but
as guardian for her son sue attacks the
will oi Carlton C. Coieman with vigor. In
her statement she sets forth that the
drawing of the will was irreeular in
many respect?; that Coleman's will was
not signed by Carlton Cbinn Coieman,
nor was it signed by his direction.
Further that it was not witnessed in his
presence and last that at the time the will
was made Carlton C. Coieman, by reason
of his sickness, was not oi sound mind.
The allegation lurther sets forth that
Carlton Chirm Coieman was
Unduly Influenced by his motner, Carrie M.
P. Coieman, who wholly controlled and irre
sistibly Influenced tne testator and who cher
ished the most bitter enmity toward the peti
tioner and his mother, Kdlth ttinnding
Coieman. The said Carrie M. P. Colemau was
a woman of strong will and overbearing and
domineering disposition and easily and con
tinuously influenced her son.
Actuated by her unnatural and intense
ha. red of petitioner and his mother she poi
soned the mind of Carlton China Coieinan
agaiu.st his offspring and Edith Bianding Cole
man itna inllueuccd him to deprive them ot
their natural rights by representing tnat tho
mother of petitioner was extravagant and
would squander the fortune if U were left to
petitioner, uho>e guardiun she is.
All attorney who is more or less inter
ested in the casa stated that Mrs. E. ii.
Coieman is in no way concerned in the
matter except as the guardian for her
child, whom she desires to see put in pos
session of bis father's estate. He aaia, in
substance, that theallegationsof undue in
fluence on the part of Mrs. W. T. Coieman
are true to Uir letter and are apparent to
all familiar with tbe tacts. He said that
tbe same band that drew up Mrs. Willinm
T. Coleman's will and maae sued peculiar
and unnatural conditions also madu tne
will of Carlton Chirm Colemnn.
He said : "Carieton C. Colraan's will is so
drawn that the boy cannot secure the
benefits of his lather's estate. If be dies
before he is twenty-one tbe estate goes to
his uncle, who is already a very wealthy
man. Suppose that after the lad reaches
his majority he should mnrry and have
children and then die b?fore he reaches
his thirtieth year why his widow ana
children would b2 left, penniless. Under
the will they could not secure a cent of
their husband and father's estate, which
would all go to a man already wealthy.
"It is unfair and unnatural, and the
document on its face shows tho handi
work of some one other than the boy's
father, Carlton C. Colemnn. Whose handi
work ami influence caused that will to be
drawn is also apparent by the terms of
Mrs William T. Coleman's will, which
are identical in every particular with
those of her son. Mrs. Edith B. Coieman
makes her claims dispassionately for her
boy."
Tne Union Trust Company has been
cited to appear iv court on November 20
and show cause why the will should not
be revoked. As a rule trust companies do
not waste much time lighting such cases,
so it is expected that the active contest
will be made by Robert L?wis Coieman,
who i* now one of the most interesiep
parties in tiie case.
The Kgyptiau Kabob.
Every country has its own little delica
cies and Egypt is famous for its kabobs.
Ihe kabob is broiled meat, but is broiled
in so ridiculous a fashion as to be really
funny. The peddler uses a little charcoal
furnace, something like those in use by
our plumbers. In it he Keeps up a small
but liot fire. Attached to the side of the
furnace are a lot of iron skewers. When a
customer approaches the hawker takes a
small piece of meat, mutton or goat, the
latter being the most popular; cuts it with
ii sharp knife into a long ribbon, winds it
around the skewer and places it upon the
charcoal lire. Some of the drippings are
collected and with a little salt and ppice
make a pleasant aauce for the kabob when
it is done.

during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperatirre. The
word "hleh" moans high barometric pressure and
Is usually acconuiani.-d by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather'and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
rcast. When tho pressure is high in thr interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when ihe "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rnin BOiith of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in ihÂ« vicinity of Idaho, and
ihe pressurfi falling to the California coas 1. warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these condition*

AT THE POLLS
The Followers of Frick
and Hilborn Kept Their
Knives Sheathed.
A Solid Republican Front for
the Municipal Cam
paign.
NO NEED FOR NOK-PARTISAN3.
The Secretary of War Will Soon
Think Alameda County Is
Full of Cranks.
Oakland Office San Fbaxcisco Call,}
903 Broadway, Nov. 8. f
Not for many yeara have the Republi
cans of Alameda County shown so much
harmony as existed at the polls last Tues
day. Three montus ago, according to the
statements of the fusionists, the party
here was about equally divided between
the followers of Mr. Frick and Mr. Hil
born, and it was predicted that when the
election came off there would be a greater
breach than at the primaries. Just the re
verse was the case, and so far as can be
seen by a critical examination of the Hil
born vote, not a single knife was un
sheathed within the party. Hr. Hi! born
received a vote as large as that cast at the
primary for both himself and Mr. Frick,
and certainly there could be no better evi
dence of a solid party. With the exception
of one supervisorial district, which is so
. close that the result will be contested, no
one outside of the Republican party was
â¢ elected. There is a moral in this which
must not be lost sight of and on which
the welfare cf Oakland depends for the
next two years.
A municipal campaien wili be com
menced in a few weeks, and it is to be
hoped that the indications of a united
party in the city as well as the whole
couniy will not be blasted. With such a
-mowing as was made last week there can
be no need of any intermediate or non
partisan parties in this city. Four years
.i-yio when tne Non-Partisans scored their
first victory there was possibly some ex
i-use ior their existence. Now there is
none. It stands to reason that with such
a majority of the electurs as is possessed
by the Republican party at this time mere
must be within that party a majority of
the best material from which to select a
comjilete municipal ticket. Four years of
a disrupted municipal government has
not be#n without its advantages in the
way of imparting experience, and, al
though the dignity of the c;ty may not
have been benefited during that time, the
less-otis learned may prove of inestimable
value in the future. It. has been clearly
proved that nothing can be done either in
the way of public improvement or of econ
omy unless there be harmony between
the various governmental boards.
Over v year has parsed since Mayor Davie
was read out oi ihe People's party atiii was
ieciared to be what he is in fact, a Repub
lican, and there might oe worst- mistakes
made than to place mm in the po-itiun vi
his own successor. But It is altogether
too early to predict at this time what the
volaiile people oi Oakland will do at the
muuicipal conventions.
Some prominent members of the Oak
land Board of Trade said some very pe
culiar things last week about the singular
behavior of Alameda's Board of Trustees.
As a result of the tigli ting over the tidal
canal there is now on file ai the Ciiy Hall
the choicest collection of contradictory
matter that has ever found a place in the
interesting archives of Oakland. Ed>ou
Adams, H. C. Trowbndge and M. J. Kel
ler are wondering what ciass of people
dwell in the city across the estuary. They
Lave ceased talking about the points in
controversy, and the present difference is
confined to estimating the amount of re
liability that it is safe to place in a cer
tified document of an Alameda city official.
The Oakland gentlemen have the signa
tures of tue Alameda gentlemen to an
agreement which is also attested by tie
City Council of Oakland and will shortly
arrive at the War Department, Washing
ton. About the same time a document
will arrive from Alameda withdrawing
the signatures of the Alameda officials, in
forming the Secretary of War that they
signed their names to something they d:d
not mean, and expressing a desire tnat
what they did in good faith shall be
ignored. This is in accordance with the
precedent set by Dr. McLean. Health Offi
cer of Alameda, some month- ago, when
ho obtained the signatures of the Oakland
officials to a document which they signed
under a delusion, and which they after
ward repudiated. At the present stave of
affairs the whole business looks like a
monkey-and-parrot circus.
For many years Oakland, from n social,
political and religious point of view, has
been regarded as the Mecca of cranks. If
some sensible and abiding agreement is
not !-oon reached between the two leading
ciiies of this county the Secretary of War
will think that the unenvious distinction
is now being sought by the commercial
element. S. W. B
TO HONOR IRISH.
Sound Money League Intends to Ex-
press Its Gratitude.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. B.â The Sound
Money League of Oakland considers that
it ought in some way to testify to its ap
preciation of the services of Colonel John
P. Irisn.
Within a few days a meeting will be
aeld and the matter taken in hand and
icted upon. No DlanÃ have yet been laid
and it is not known wnetber the reception
will take the form of a public meeting or a
banquet or what body shall have cuarge
of the affair. But there is a strong feel
ing that Mr. Irisn's services to the cause
'A sound money demand recognition in
ais home city.
Now that the colonel is at home, he is
full of funny stories of how he chased Mr.
Bryan on special trains, caujhi the same
crowd, how he got into a railroad wreck
and out of it unscratcbed, and several
sther interesting experiences, most of
a Inch have been touched on in the tele
graphic dispatcues of his campaign.

The Man Who Refused a Federal Office.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. B.â Frank A. Leach, the proprietor of the Oakland
Enquirer, surprised his friends yesterday. A statement had been published
that Mr. Leach was a candidate for Postmaster. Last evening Mr. Leach pub
lished the lollowing notice in his paper:
"Enterprising journalists,, who are announcing the disposition of all the
Federal offices, would do well to remember that some of them will not be
vacant for a loni? time yet. The Postmaster of Oakland has two years or more
to serve, and, as McKinley's is to be a civil service reform administration, Mr.
White will not be disturbed till the end of his term. Six years ago* the
appointment to the Oakland postoffice was offered, absolutely and without
qualification, to Frank A. Leach, and he declined it because he thought that
newspaper publishing and Federal office-holding did not go well together.
And he does not want a postoffice any more now than be did six years ago."
TIIE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 6, 1896.
BERKELEY TRUSTEES
AND A CITADEL
They Have Concluded That
Mrs. Townsend Is in
the Wrong.
The Old Woman Who Holds Her
House With a Pistol
Must Fight.
WARRANTS FOR HER ARREST.
Eight-Day Ccurse of Mission Lectures
Begins at St. Mark's Epis-
Ci pal Church.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. B.â The town
authorities have taken up the case of
Mary Townsend, who has been waging
war against the Sonthern Pacific Com
pany and the town of Berkeley now and
then for the last twenty years, over the
possession of a strip of land on iShattuck
avenue, and, as the matter now stands.it
would seem that the case will soon be
settled once for all unless the gray-haired
littie woii.au carries out her threat to
shoot the man who lays hands on her
dwelling, wh:ch is now astride a gutter on
Shattuck avenue.
I'rt's i;cnt Richards of the Board of
Trustees, Town Attorney Hayne and
Street Superintendent Guy Chick were
in consultation this afternoon over the
matter and the decision was reached by
them that Mrs. Townsend has no right
whatsoever to the property in dispute and
hence no just reason for setting up a gar
rison within her humble dwelling and de
fying law and order.
The impression baa gone abroad that
Mr?. Townsend is a much abused woman
and that she is being soreiy persecuted by
the railroad company and th town of
Berkeley, but reference to the history of
the early procee dings in the case, which
date back some twenty years, goes to show
that she was well paid for the lot which
she is attempting to hold, besides being
mede a present of the house thÂ« has
turned into an arsenal.
It seems that when tbe railroad was
about t o be put through in 1876 the com
pany sought to purchase a small lot from
Mr-<. Townsend, which projected into
what is now Sbattuck avenue. Sue re
iuse<i to sell, contrary to the precedent
set by all the other property-owners along
the line, an ; so a suit to condemn the
property was entered.
The jury set a price of $1030 on the land
j and house, which was said to have been
nine more than it was worth, and the
railroad com pan paid the bill, giving
back to Mrs. Townsend the house thai
they had purchased from her.
The franchise of the company was to ex
tend fifty years, at the find of which time,
if i: was not renewed or the road was
I abandoned, the property, which once be
! longed to Mrs. Townseiia, should revert
to her. Only twenty of the fifty years
have passed and so the lady seems to have
no claim on that ground, s j far as tbe rail
road is concerned.
The town authorities say that even. if
such an agreement had not been reached
between Mr-. Townsend and the company
the town of Berkeley could legally claim
the piece of property, because they have
had peaceable possession of it as a thor
oughfare for the past five years.
A few days ago she secured permission
to move the house into the street, osten
sibly for the purpose of having the lot
upon which it stood graded. When the
house was partly moved onto the dis
puted property she cut the hawser with a
hand ax paid the contractor for the work
and discharged him.
The grading proposition seems to have
been only a subterfuge for netting the
house down on the old lot. Since its re
moval either she or her son has stood
guard over it with a revolver, defying any
one lo lay their hands on it.
When the time comes for the return of
the house to its p ace, which is only a
matter of a few days, the Street Superin
tendent will take it in hand, and unless
Mrs. Townsend is placed under arrest be
fore that time or acquiesces in the opinion
of the Town Attorney a shooting affray
will not be an impossibility.
The Town Board will meet in regular
session to-morrow evening, at which time
the case will be brought up. Two wai
rants are out for the arrest of Mrs. Town
send, who is 76 years of ace. but no one
has seemed inclined to serve them.
Misgio â  Service* Begun.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. B.â Archdeacon
Percy Webber of Boston opened his eight
day course of "mission" lectures under
the auspices of St. Mark's Episcopal
church at Shattuck Hall to-night. A large
audience was present, notwithstanding the

although the Archdeacon preached this
morning at St. Mark's Church. At the
mornine service an extraordinarily large
audience was present, the building naving
been crowded to the doors. Many wore
forced to stand because of the lack of seat

The disllnguinhed speaker chose for his
text: "If any man will come alter me, let
him take up his cross daily and tollow

which will be of good service to mankind

WOMAN OF THE FUTURE.
Mrs- Hodgson Burnett Gives Her Opin
ion on the Subject.
In the admirable speech in which she
responded to the toast of her health at the
pleasant dinner given in her honor by the
Authors' Club, Mrs. Hodgson Burnett
drew a picture of the woman of the future
thus:
"I think it probable that, say a hundred
years from now, a woman may stand as I
do in some such place as this, the guest of
men who have done the work all the world
has known and honored, an t she will be
the outcome of all the best and most logi
cal thinking of all the most reasonable
and clear-brained men and women, women
and men, of these seething years. She
will know all the things 1 have not learned,
and she will be a woman so much wiser
and more stately of mind than I could ever
hope to be; she will have so much more
brain, so much more fine and clear reason
that if we were compared we should
scarcely seem to be creatures of the same
race. And of this woman I say 'Good luck
to her, great happiness, fair fortunes, and
all the fullest ioyousness of living; all
kind fates attend her, all good things to
her and to the men who will bej her
frieuds.' "â Westminister Gazette.

BROOK INTERFERENCE.
Mr. Krk Creates His Own Styles
and Repels Suggestions From
Poole and Eell.
The new Li Hung Chans overcoat which
J. Waldere Kirk, the emperor of the dudes,
brought here from New York, and which
has charmed the eye of the multitudes, as
told yesterday, continues to attract at
tention.
The emperor got back last night from a
brief visit to San Jose. No sooner had he
registered at the Palace than a crowd sur
rounded him. When he walked across
t h.- corridor later and finally went to the
grillroom all eyes followed him.
Mr. Kirk is a young man of rather
comely appearance. Attired in his best
suit with his big Li Hung Chang overcoat
on and his trusty walking stick grasped
by the middle he cuts a figure such as is
sure to make the ladies look twice at him.
This is not unpleasant to Mr. Kirk, for all
his life he has been an admirer of the sex
less stern than himself.
When it comes lo coats and other arti
cles of apparel Mr. Kirk is his own
modeler, or, as he says, they are of his
own creation. He will trust nobody else
to do this. Even those whom Mr." Kirk
knows intimately are never consulted, and
as to Bell and other similar authonties|as
to tne architecture of clothes, he will have
none of them unless they comply with
what he thinks is the right idea.
"In these things," said the gentleman
who sets ihe styles, speaking in the plu
ral, "we lead; we do not follow."
It was thus that his slogan went forth.
There has been a number of the San
Francisco tailors who have called on the
distinguished visitor during the last few
days to view his raiment. To each and all
he has been invariably polite.
has not only exhibited the Li Hung
Chang coat, but numerous others con
structed for the various occasions for
which as a leader of the fashions he must
be appropriately att'red. He has also
shown bis ies in all their infinite variety
and brilliancy of finish.
Besides all these and the countless
other things which an eminent gentle
man needs on his travels, he has exhib
ited the fourteen pairs of shoes which
always go with him, and which fill of
themselves a large traveling case.
As to the rings and pins, each set with
rare and costly gems, which the royal
visitor possesses, words fail almost to ade
quate.y set forth their virtues. It is
enough probabty to say that Mr. Kirk is
stocked up in this, as in other respects.
New riiiKs and pins are flas ed every day
and on each occasion as befits it.
Tde Li Hung Chang coat, one of the
M;rnal virtues of which is its liberality of
size as regards the back, is the creation in
which the potentate takes the greatest
pride.

TO HELP WORTHY WOMEN
The Associated Charities Are
Trying: to Arrange a
New Plan.
Laundris a.d Workrooms Have
Proved to B- Mrst Practicable
in the Eist.
Oakland Office Han Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 8. J
Having successfully launched a wood
yard where men can earn at least food and
lodging, until other employment can be
obtained for them, the A-sociaied Chari
ties is now directing its attention to un
employed women.
There are in this city quite a number of
women who are able and willing to work,
but who are denied tie privilege. By the
records kept in the office of the Associated
Charities it is known that they are in
every respect honorable and worthy. By
corresponding with other cities, ihe in
formation has been gained that the most
practical method of putting these women
in an independent position s by the
establishment of first-class laundries.
The public have, wtiere tne experiment
has been tried, been very generous in the
patronage ot such place*, while it does
not appear that any alternating hardship
has been worked except probably by
throwing a lew Chinese out oi employ
ment.
"Now that the desire of our hearts for
years has becume a fact," said Mrs. S. C.
Borland of the society, yesterday, "and
the woodyard is established, we wish to
begin on the other side of the problem and
provide work ior women also. We reler.
of course, to unskilled laborers who need
just such an opportunity to work as the
woodyard affords to the men. We have
long leit the necessity of this move, but
we have to proceel very slowly, as our
tr cans are so limited. We have discussed
this question occasionally with the benevo
lent and philanthropic women of this
city, an 1 we nave every reason to believe
tnat as soon as they understand that the
association is ready and anxious to in
augurate snch a work, they will respond
nobly to our plea with most geuerous con
tributions.
"Getting started in any business enter
prise is '.he hardest work. In consulting
the reports whit h have come to our office
from various cities we find the successful
and favorite plan for women is the esiab
lishment of laundries and workrooms. In
Brooklyn the quality of work done in
their several laundries ;s first class. The
clothes are all washed and iror.ed by hand
and no injurious chemicals are used. The
laundries are thus not only benefiting
those employed in them, but are render
ing useful service in the community. In
tne various workrooms women are taught
to repair and make over garments from
clothing donated, the garment then be
coming their own property. Meals are
served at the rooms and women take their
turn in preparing tnenÂ». They are taueht
the most economical way of cooking, the
setting of tables and houst cleaning. Those
who cannot do heavier work cut and sew
carpet rags. The re-ult of this experiment
has been that a marsed improvement has
been noticed in the order and . eneral de
portment of the women thus helped.
"Whe.her a laundry in this city in com
petition with the Chinese would be self
supporting we are not prepared to say
just now, but that some such work lor
women is a necessity tnrough the coming
winter is a self-evident lact."

ACTIVE DUTY IN
ARMY CIRCLES
Routine of Artillery In
struction Resumed at
the Presidio.
Colonel Young of tha Fourth
Cavalry Is Coming to Inspect
New Horses.
SCME RECENT PROMOTIONS
Reports on Athletic Exercises â Ci
ditions of the Obstacle Race in
Ih3 Cavalry Camp.
The regular routine of military duty has
been resumed at the Presidio, Fort Mason,
Alcatraz and Angel Island. Artillery
men, according to orders, were brought
over from the inland posts last week and
given instruction in tho handling of the
dynamite and mortar batteries and the
li-inch rifles. The officers and enlisted
men of the Third Amlleiy welcome the
change from Florida and .Louisiana to
California with delight, but perceive al
ready that the duty in the harbor is to be
active. The magnitude of the fatigue par
ties going out early every morning to
work on the fortifications indicates that the
life of the soldier is not an idle one. lour
ing the past week the weather has been
favorable for worK and drilling;.
Lieutenant - Colonel Samuel B. M.
Young, Fourth Cavalry, will be in town
for two or three days this week. Jle is
coming in from Madera, where his troop
ers are now stationed, to inspect some
horses recently purchased in Southern
Oregon by the quartermaster's depart
ment. Colonel Young will inspect twenty
eight horses. -â  â â >,*â¢
On Friday, December 4, Colonel A. S.
Kimball, chief quartermaster of the de
partment, will open proposals for twenty
three horses. The process of selecting
horses for the cavalry is interesting.
The cost averages $123 per animal, but not
own than one of every twenty horses
offered is accepted. , The horses to be re
ceived must conform to the following
specifications:
They must be sound, well bred and of a su
perior class; gentle under the saddle; free
from vicious habits ; with tree and prompt ac
tion at the walk, trot and iruliop;Uviihout
blemish or defect; of a kind disposition, with
easy month and gait, ami otherwise to con
form to the following: description: Geldings
of uniform anci hardy coiors; in good condi
tion; from fifteen and one-luu.-rii to sixteen
hands high; weiebl not less than 950 nor
more than 1150 pounds; from four to eight
years old; head and ours small; ' forehead
broad; eyes large and prominent; vision per
fect in every respect; siioulders long ana slop
ing well back; chest full, broad and deep;
forelegs straight and standing well under;
barrel large and increasing iroin girth toward
flank; withers elevated; back short and
straight; loins and haunches broad and mus
cular; hocks well bent and under the horse;
pasterns slanting and feet small and sound.
A horse under 4 years of age will not be
accepted, unless he is a specially fine
animal, well developed. Of the twenty
three cavalry horses required, two must be
blood bay color, six must be iron pray,
seven must be black, seven must bo dark
bay and one must be gray. <
When a band of horses is chosen, for
instance in Southern Oregon, the Chief
Quartermaster sends a man there to make
a preliminary inspection. The lirst in
spection is so thorough that the horses
which pass are almost sure to be accepted
at the Presidio, unless bruised or blem
ished by transportation.
There is some rejoicing in military
circles of San Francisco over lecent pro
motions. Lieutenant Sydney A. Clonian,
First Infantry, has been advanced one
grade in the lieutenancy. The promotion
follows so soon after his successful sire
ship of the united service jinks at the
Bohemian Club, that there is sure to be a
demand in army circles for the honor of
siring a jinks.
James M. Lancaster, Third Artillery,
has been promoted to major, Fourth Ar
tillery. Joseph â M. Califf has been pro
moted from first lieutenant to captain,
Third Artillery.
Morris K. Barroll has been promoted
from first lieutenant. Second Artillery, to

Additional Second Lieutenant James N.
Pickering, Tsnth Infantry, is to be second

At San Diego Barracks there was boat
racinsr, and boats had to be hired for the
occasion. The post commander at San
Diego, probably a young officer, managed
to gel in one blow on the quartermaster's
department. In commenting on tieUl day,
the ollicer says: "It is a matter ol con
stant regret to us as well as a surprise to
the public mind that tho pos!, with its
tine water facilities and tht necessity (aud
economy for official visits to ship 5 ) lor a
boat, has not a suitable barge. With no
funds for prizes and no gymnasium, it is
rather disheartening to remember that a
requisition for such a boat was disapproved
in March last, after having been approved
by the department commander. It is
hoped that the nsw uses which can be
made of such a boat, which are so entirely
in accord with the expressed wishes of tr.e
major-general commanding the army,
with reference" to uthletics, may cause a
favorable consideration oi our necessities."

<laiiÂ£erod.
Hon. D. P. Thompson of Oregon, ex-
Minister to Turkey, arrived here yester
day, alter having been in Japan since
August. Mr. Thompson ran for Governor
of Oregon in 1890, but was beaten by
Pennoyer by 5000 vote?, the Democrats and
Populists having fused against Mr.
Thompson, who is a Republican.
Mr. Thompson carefully looked up
manufacturing in Japan. He says ho has
returned more than ever convinced that
San Francisco needs protection. The
Japanese now have a great cotton-cloth
factory in Osaka. They get the cotton
from the Uniiei States via Liverpool and
through the buez canal, and with their
cheap labor are able to make cotton goods
lar cheaper than we, and sell the gooas
finally to us.
Itis the same way with bicycles.c les. Three
great factories have sprung up in Osaka
and there the Japanese are turning out
large numbers of pretty fair bicycles at M
yen each, or $17. L.adot only coats 15 cents
a day.

. Veneered Djviitry.
"After the Election, What?" was the
subject selected by Rev. Dr. Case last
night. Among other things he said:
A great election like that of last week is
a great focalizer of thought and feeling.
It was a nation in ferment, a nation
aroused. It was the most thoughtful
canvass of the century, and more people
knew why they voted for Bryan or Mc-
Kinley than ever before. It was a most
hopeiul canvass, an intelligent focusing of
thought. The people knew what they
were voting for and did not hesitate to do
it. All this means the breaking up of old
party lines, the burying of old issues and
the taking up of new.
The two old parties are slowly disin
tegrating, for there are other things to be
considered besides the question of low
tariff or high tariff. There are moral
issues mat must and will be considered. I
do not think I want to live another hun
dred years, but the coming generation will
witness a new era of things. Our land is
the battlefield of the world. It is destined
to become a field of blood, in which priest
craft, saloon.", misrule, atheism, infidelity,
anarchy, monopoly, capitalism, pauper
ism, laziness, socialism and crime will
take part. There will be great struggles
between great armies, and only the Om
nipotent can tell what, the political com
plexion will be a hundred years hence.
But, after the election what? Election
iÂ« a sort of socialism or communism â a
bringing together of nil the forces favor
ing either candidate. After the election
it becomes an individualism. A sol
emn trust is imposed in the suc
cessful candidates and thÂ« , people
who elected them should not quietly
slip in the background. We should work
all the time and see to it that the bosses
are downed. We. must do away with the
spoils system ; it is a harbinger of crime
and is generally demoralizing to the
asses, v;
The greatest obstacle in our municipal
government is the boodler element, that
is, the man who buys a vote and the man
who sells it. It ought to be a penitentiary
offense for a man to sell his ballot. To
overcome this we must educate the peo
ple, beginning with the little children.
We want men to feel the power of per
sonal influence. I think we should ask
every man who runs for office if he has a
wife, and if so what kind of a woman she
is. If a man is not married, then we
ought to know the kind of women he con
sorts with after regular business. It is
this subtle, unseen influence that we want
to purify tiiemunicipa:ity.
Among the people there is at present
but little happiness, wnereas thirty or
forty years .12:0 there was contentment.
The air is full of pessimism and crime is
stalking unchecked through the land.
Nearly every day we hear of a suicide, and
the divorce courts are full to overflowing.
Men are trying to band together as Popu
list?, socialists, labor unions and such
things, and for the most uart, especially
in Europe, they ignore God. But the
wants of the poor are just as pressing as
before these organizations came.
The interests of San Francisco demand
a number of radical reforms, but the poor
have to wait. How long? How lone be
fore Sunday closing? . How long before
municipal honesty? How long before the
rich are taxed in proportion to the poor?
How long before San Francisco shall be
one of God's cities instead of the head
quarters of masked and veneered deviltry?
But the world moves. The good old times
were the bad old times. Time was never
so old as now and never ho good. But we
can make them better. How? Bygettinc
right in with God. ' .'

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1896.
REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
A Revival of Business
Believed to Be Near
at Hand.
The Savings Banks to Gradually
Resume the Loaning
of Money.
RECENT IMPORTANT SALES.
The Menlo Park Property in the City
of Los Angeles to Be Sold
at Auction.
The indications during the past week for an
enrly revival and quickening of trade, com
merce nnd manufacture haVe Deen most pro
pitious. Although the real estate market in
this City at the present time is inactive,Jpromi
nent dealers express the belief that a decided
improvement for the better is near at hand,
ana look forward to thd next few months
bringing these returns.
The savings banks express their intention
of gradually resuming the loaning of money
which was almost entirely suspended a few
months ago.
The most Important transfer of the week
was effected by Shainwald, Buckbee & Co. in
the sale of the property on the north line of
Geary street, west of Powell, wnich was for
merly occupied by the Union League Club.
The lot has a frontage of 50 by a depth of
137:6 teet, and tiie price reported is said to be
about $900 a front foot. Miss Juauita Lnveaga
is the seller ami A. Arousun the purchaser.
fn place of the old building now on the lot
plans are being prepared for a six-story struc
ture of brick and stone to cost in the neigh
borhood of $7r>,000.
Tne following is taken from Magee's Circular
for October:
"Although four or five largo sales or ex
changes of real estate were made in October,
â¢be market generally was a very dull and
waning one. The question of the election
ruled. â¢ * â¢
"There is an immense amount of money in
investors' hands â money drawn from banks as
well as money gathered in from rents, pay
ment of debts, etc. * â¢ * Therein likely to
be a very decided increase in real estate sales.
The rise in wheat and crapes, and the im
proved value of country landt which followed,
tend to benefit City real estate. Many persons
had their confidence in City real estate weak
ened by the continuous fall in prices of agri
cultural products, which began about live
years Ago, and the reduced value of agricul
tural lands which followed.
"There is still a fair demand for lots â worth
$1500 to $3000 and of vacant lots of the value
of $3000 to $5000. â¢ â¢ *
'â¢ All of our city savings banks combined lent
only $3-10.835 in October, against $865,275 in
October, '95, und $1,099,445 in October, '94.
Small as the amount 01 money lent last month
was, too, the figures are larger man the facts,
for a', Â«st one- third of the mortgages recorded
were renewals of old loan** and not the letting
out of new money. Applicants for loans last
mouth wore told that they could have all
the money they wanted in November
ifMcKinley was elected. Now, ns this was the
answer at all ol the banksâ the oflieers of some
of which are prominent' Democrats â it can
safely be asserted that such answer was not
born of politics but of facts which are not all
within the control of bank directors.
Private lenders last month lent $352,522 on
city real estate mortgagee. The rate of iuter
est they exacted was greater than that charged
by savin?* banks. The total number of mort
gages recorded in October was 315, of the
total value of $(!!Â»."Â». 507. against 173 releases
of the value of $384,048."

I PISTOL AT A
PRAYER MEETING
Excitement in the Salva
tion Army Head
quarters.
Charles R. Sbaw, an Intoxicated
Member, Pulls Out a
Revolver.
FIGHT FOR ITS POSSESSION.
The Revolver Explodes and P. G.
Schipper Has His Thumb Almost
B own Off.
A pistol shot in trie Salvation Army
headquarters, 1193 Market street, caused
considerable excitement in the neighbor
hood yesterday morning about 11 o'clock.
A bullet was iired from a revolver in the
possession of Charles R. Shaw, a carpen
ter by trade, and a member of the Salva
tion Army, who was under the influence
of liquor and is at the City Prison on the
charge of assault to murder.
Shaw hed been drinkine for about a
week nid Adjutant Bull of the Sixth
corps, to which Sbaw belongs, happened to
see him on Taylor and Maiket streets
yesterday morning where the corps holds
open-air meetings. Knowing his condi
tion she did not wish him to take part in
thi open-air meeting, so she sent M. M.
Woods, another member of the corps, to
bring him to headquarters to attend the
morning prayer meeting there.
Woods, after a deal of persuasion, got
Shaw to accompany him to headquarters.
They took a seat on a form in congress
hall near the door. The meeting went on,
but Shaw became noisy and "Woods could
not prevail upon him to keep quiet.
P. G. Schipper, who was seated opposite
to Shaw, crossed over to help Woods in
keeping Shaw in order. Woods whispered
to Schipper that Shaw had a revolver in
his overcoat pocket and to try and get it
from him. Schipper talked to Shaw for a
few moments and noticed that he kept his
hand in his overcoat pocket. Finally
Rhaw put ou his tint and rose from his
beat.
"You're not going away?" asked Schip
per.
'Yes, I am," replied Sbaw, "I want to
get uut."
"You're not mad, Charlie, are you?"
asked Schipper. "Sit down, man, and re
main till the meeting is over."
Siiaw placed his hat on the seat and
puiled fcue revolver out of his overcoat
pocket. Schippor was watching him
and promptly grabbed the weapon to
wrencu it from htm. During the struggle
the revolver exploded and the bullet
struck Schipper s right thumb, went
through Shaw's hat and buried itself in
the seat. Ischipper wrenched tne revolver
Irom Shaw. It was fortunate that no one
was sitting in the vicinity, otherwise Shaw
might have been called upon to answer to
a mors serious charge.
The report of the shot brought the meet
ine to an abrupt close. Adjutant Bull
and other members of the army crowded
round Shaw, while Schipper hastened to
the Keceiving Hospital.
A member of the army ran to the Cen
tral Police Station and notified Sergeant
Nash of the shooting. The sergeant sent
Policeman Gaynor with the patrol wagon
to the army* headquarters and Gaynor
placed Shaw under arrest, against the
strenuous objections of the members of
the army, who claimed it was all an acci
dent. No one would prefer a charge, so
Gaynor had to do so himself.
Adjutant Bull had a long talk with
Shaw in the City Prison. She tried bard
to ascertain what he wanted with a loaded
revolver, but he would not give her any
satisfactory answer. She found out that
he bad married a young girl aboul a week
ago, but whether ttiat had anything to do
with starting him off on his debauch is a
matter of conjecture. Shaw is 30 years of
age.
MEETING OF THE MINERS
The State Association to Con- !
vene in This City To-
Morrow.
Important Subjects to Come Before
the Members for Discus
sion.
The State Miners' Association will con
vene to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock in
Odd Fellows' Hall with a full representa
tion of delegates from all of the mining
centers of the State.
The number of representatives and the
counties from which they come are as fol
lows:

These with members of the Chamber of
Commerce and .Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association will swell the number
present to quite a dignified body.

association, will open headquarters at the

tamed regarding the questions likely to
come before the convention.
The convention will take decided meas-
Uies lo have the laws amended regarding
location and assessment, riparian rights,
sale of bullion and amalgam â subjects
that have received no attention at the
hands of the Legislature since 1850.
Another question that will receive the
attention of the convention will be a reso
lution which will no doubt be passed, re
questing Governor Budd to till one of the
two vacancies soon to occur in the Board
of Regents for the State University with a
practical mineralogist.
The convention will also urge that the
next session of Congress make provisions
for the appointment of an additional Cabi
net otlicer, whose duties it will bo to look
after mines and miner?' claims* and rights.
An officer attached to the executive
branch of the Nation's Government on
this subject, it is claimed by those inter
ested in mines, would be of equal if not oi
more importance than a Minister of Agri
culture.
An act had been before Congress on a
previous occasion, but it did not pass. In
tbe meantime the miners were busy in ob
taining favorable views from the present
elected members regarding this bill with
the Cabinet provision uttacned.
The valuable services rendered the
Miners' Association by President J. H.
Neff will insure his re-election, although
he has signified his intention of retiring,
but the delegates whose views have been
ascertained on this subject say they will
not listen to President Neff's wishes in the
matter.

PHILBROOK WILL FIGHT.
He Will Ask the Supreme Court for a
Rehearing in the Levinson Case.
Horace \V. Phil brook is not satisfied to
let the case of Ira P. Rankin as adminis
trator of the estate of JohnLevinson.de
ceased, against William J. Newman rest
upon the decision handed down by the
Supreme Court last Thursday. This was
the ca*e which led to the disbarment of
Mr. Phil brook. Yesterday Mr. PhilbrooK
said that he would very soon lite a peti
tion in the Supreme Court for a rehearing.
He said that he believed that he would be
able to show good and satisfactory grounds
j for granting his petition. At any rate, he
was going to make the attempt as soon as
he could do so.
Since the Supreme Court disposed of
i th â  cisc Mr. Philbrook has been studying
I the two opinions that were filed. The
first of these was signed by Justices Gar
routte, McFarland and Van Fleet. The
; Â«econd was signed by Justices Beatty,
! Hensbaw and Temple. Mr. Philbrook be
; lieves that this was a mistake. The law
j makes it necessary for four Justices to
j concur. Mr. Philbrook claimed, :m d the
j record showed, that there were only three
signatures to either of the opinions handed
down. He has various grounds for
moving for a new hearing, but he declined
to mane these public yesterday.
LIVE HARES WERE SCARCE.
Tho Hnmane Directors Met
With a Ituther Sad Disappointment.
Directors Theodore Gruenhagen, Luman
Wadham, Max Stein, Martin Stevens and
H. E. Holmes of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals were early
callers yesterday morning at the Presidio
Athletic Grounds.
Tney had been Invited by the directors
of the ban Francisco Fox-terrier Coursing
Club, and it was proposed to illustrate to
them that the killing of hares by fox
terriers was by no meant cruel and surely
not so painful as the killing done by
honnds.
TLere was disappointment all round, as
the hares ordered by the ciub failed to
arrive until loug after the ueparture of
the guests.
In consequence there was no live game
coursing and the few hundreds of people
who assembled witnessed the running of
the stuffed har- pulled along at the end
of a cord and chased by the terriers.

TOM SHARKEY
HAS A MASCOT
It Is a Handsome Bull-
Terrier of an Affec
tionate Turn.
The "Sailor" Likes Htm Be
cause He Bites Wilhout
Making Noise.
HARD WORK AT THE BEACH.
A Chat With the Phenomenal Young
Fighter While Hs Rests on
Sunday.
Tom Sbarkey has a mascot. He de
j clared yesterday that he had great confi-
I dence in the efficacy ol this lucky com
panion, although ie is nothing more nor
' less than a handsome bull terrier with
i sleek white hair, a good-natured eye, but
, ! constructed on business lines. The dog
i is named Sharkey Junior and after his
i second day with the wonderful pugilist
j has become a constant and faithful fol
lower.
"He's a mascot," remarked Sharkey at
I the Ocean Beach pavilion. "He's my
best friend. Fitzs.mmons had a iion.
That's too common. I had a bear. That's
j too slow. This fellow is all right. A
white dog is safe to bet on."
Just then the ferocious, although most
docile, terrier started in to punch the bag
!in his own way by jumping up at the
i leather ball and vaiuly endeavoring to
! snap it in two.
"Come off thero !" Sharkey shouted.
But the mascot would not let go. '-He's
made of the right stuff," the fighter added,
"but I want him to obey me. Yesterday,
1 while I was punching the bag, he had me
by the leg before I knew he was near me.
You see he never barksâ just goes to busi
ness and says nothine."
Sharkey unbuttoned his coat to give a
little exhibition of whirlwind tinting.
The bag seemed to be a!l over me plant nt
once. Arms and resolute lists and leather
ball were all mixed up, but the "sailor"
was awa)* from the tangle standing erect
except when he ducked occasionally. It
wa-j ereat sport for the mascot, which
emitted short, suppressed growls and
< snapped his teeth.
"Sow what do you think of my training
quarters?" asked Snarkey.
T;iey have been comfortably fitted up,
and the gymnasium has everything neces
sary for n man in training. In a long
room with windows on botii Â«ide* is where
Sharkey trains. At one end is a bath
roomâto be used on wet days only â and
a punchir.g-bag. Then on tire walls are a
I wrist machine, a chest machine and de
| veloper, one of which consists of thick
i rubber cords that fly back when extended.
j The elasticity does half the work, and
Sharkey prefers the machine, which is of
j his own invention.
At the end nearest the ocean there i? a
I rubbing bench, with shelves of bottles
J and tables holding clubs and dumb-bells;
! aiso a leather bag, made according to
Sharkey's own ideas. This bag haa a
universal swivel connection tor the rope,
j which consequently does not twist, and
! still the rope is badly wornâ a sure sun
1 of the hard time that ball of leather is
j having. When the "sailor" punches it
< the whole pavilion hums and people
\ downstairs say "That's Sharkey at the
j b;Â»g." Tho other sphere shows where it
j had been burst by Sharkey's terrible
blows.
"I had that bag made in Chicago," he
explained, "and it's the speediest and
biggest Dag I've seen. But I must get a
small one, the size of Fitz's head, so that
I can be accurate in hitting him. There's
my trunks." he said, picking up a littlo
bundle of green. "I fought thirty- three
battles in them," and the generous, good
humored smile of his spread over his
whole face.
"I haven't had a month's rest in three
yeari since I started fighting," he said.
"I have been training waile tuose other
people were haviug a trood time. When
I came here from the East I weighed 175
I pounds, but then I had kept up my train
ing all the time. Yesterday my Welch t
was 180' i. I'm not losing weight, but
then I was never in better condition in
my life. Every morning 1 get up at G and
take a bicycle spin. At fifteen minutes to
7 1 have breakfast, and at 8 I go for a run
to the end of Golden Gate Park at Baker
street and back, about ten miles. Then I
j have a swim in the ocean surf and a good
I rub-down, and at 12 1 take lunch. At 2:30
I start in work again and keep it up till
3:45, punching the tag aix rounds, boxing
wiiu Billy Smith four lounds and with
George All?n three rounds, swinging clubs
and working the machines. The dpy end*
with a swim and rub-down, and if I feel
like it a bicycle ride for ten miles before
or after supper, which I have at 6 o'clock.
I'm in bed at 8:30 every night. This morn
ing I ran fourteen miles dowu the beacu,
and took a swim in the surf and punched
the bag for ten minutes, but it bein Sun
day I rest for the remainder of ti>e day.
"I could not take a bath in fresh water
without catching cold, but I'm used to the
sen air and sea wat^r, and' l like to bo
alongside the sea. No matter how wet I
may be after a run 1 can go into the sea
and never take cold. I'm right at home
out here."
One of Sharkey's trainers was nursinc a
darkened eye, and the other a swollen
hand that was sprained on Sharkey's face.
They are pven more confident than Qb ar
key himself that he will put up a memor
able battle. He ordered a pair of cloves
yesterday from a San Francisco maker,
t*ho has instructions to make a pair that
will please Sharkey's lancy.
"THE GYPSY BARON."
A New Sunday Night Departure Made
by the Tivoli. and With
Success;
The Tivoli began a new departure last
night by opening on Sunday instead of
Monday. Despite the rain the house waa
full, and there is every reason to believe
that, from a business standpoint, the
change was a wise one.
The opera was Johann Strauss' "The
â¢Gypsy Baron," which lias not been heard
here for a couple of years. The scene of
the first two acts is laid in Hungary,
and the tuneful music is given
an added fascination by the intro
duction of a good many dashing
rhythmic Magyar strains. This charac
teristic mustc calls for a *:ood deal of brio
on tne part of the conductor and the per
formers, but the really strong light opera !
company which the Tivoli now possesses
proved itself quite equal to the demands of
"The Gypsy Baron," and the chorus did
such excellent work that it was repeatedly
encored.
Lilly Post, whose light was rather hid
den beneath a bushel in "The Babes in
the Wood," had an opportunity last night
of showing her fine resonant voice and
what good control she possesses over it.
She is a much better vocalist than many
of those who have been given to us in
grand opera and at hicher prices. Rhys'
Thomas sang and acted well as the Gypsy
Baron, and John J. Raffael's song was
one of the pleasantest numbers in the
opera.
Ferris Hartman, who is nothing if not
whimsically fantastic, chose to play his
role with a strong German accent, which
caught on immensely.
His song, "More As I Can Use," was
encored so often that he had to apologize
finally, for having run out of versps.
Bern ice Holmes' voice was scarcely ro
tund enough for the role of the old gypsy,
but her make up was effective and she
acted conscientiously. El via Crox Sea-
brooke was sprightly and clever as usual
and the minor parts wereweli tilled.
LOST THEIR TOFKNOTS.
Great Grief Amon? Koreans
Because of Unceremonious
In'ruders.
Bands of Outlaws Cause Danger to
Tray lersâ A King's Predica
ment.
The Rev. A. F. Moore, a missionary of
the Presbyterian church, ior four years in
Seoul, Korea, arrived here on the steamer
Rio yesterday accompanied by his family,
and it at the Occidental. He says there is
great disquiet in Korea, and that bands of
dissatisfied natives of as many as 100 each
are going about the country robbing and
pillaging. Travelers are not safe.
King Vi, whose consort was mnrdered
over a year ngo, is still at the Russian
legation and largely under its control.
There is much dissatisfaction because of
this, A new palace is being built near the
legation f,or the King.
Some months ago the Japanesp, who
dictated the appointment of the Korean
cabinet, caused the Japanese police to cut
off the hair, or topknot, so called, of a
great many Koreans. The topknots are
a sign of distinction. They are worn only
by married men, and no man is supposed
to have properly asserted himself until he
is married and has a topknot.
The cutting off of these appendages
caused gn-at grief. There were man}' re
monstrances ann increased dissatisfaction.
However, things have so far improved
now that an edict has gone forth allowing
the Koreans to wear their topknots. The
consequence is that many whose hair was
cut oft had gone and collected it again and
fastened it on, co that their happiness has
been re-established.
The reverend gentleman says many of
the Koreans are embracing Christianity.
Mr. Moore will be here a few days and
then go on to Chicago, his former home.
A Theosoplilcal Lecture.
W. J. Walters, secretary of Golden Gate
Lodge, T. S., last evening delivered one of a
series of free lectures under the auspices of
that body. The subject was â¢'Alciiemy and
the Alcnemists." The speaker maintained
that all Binitor is one in substance ; the differ
ence in appearance biing due to ih-nikal
laws and molecular motion. The modern
science of chemistry has done much to formu
late these laws, and" whan it beotnes an exact
science will be able to reduce all niaUcr, not
only to component pans, but to primordial
substance. Mits Bertha Wudham nnd Count
Axel Wacatmeister were the musicians oi the
evening.
COLLIDED WITH
A BAY PORPOISE
Jack Caughlan's Attempt to
Swim Against a Heavy
Tide.
The Dolphin's Champion Swim
mer Tries to Lower
Cavill's Record.
WAS BAFFLED BY THE TIDE.
The Dolphin Club Turns Out With Its
Fair Lady Guests to Encourage
the Intrepid Athlete.
Jack Caughlan of the Dolphin Swim
ming and Boating Club would have sur
passed Cavill's feat in swimming across
the Golden Gate had the steam launch
that accompanied him not been delayed.
Had he started one half hc-ur earlier he
would have avoided the strong November
tide that was rushing like a millrace out
to sea.
It was his intention to begin his long
swim at 2 o'clock, but the launch that was
to land him at Lime Point was delayed
and it did not arrive there until 2:45.
His clubmates tried to dissuade him
from making the swim as the day was a
raw and misty one. A heavy fog obscured
their view of the fort and tbey were afraid
to let him risK it. But Caughlan would
not be dissuaded. He had set his mind on
equaling or surpassing Carvili's teat and
he said the day was as good as another.
Alter receiving a rub-down with witch
hazel, ana with the encouraging cheers of
his clubmates, he sprang into the chilling
sea at the same spot that Cavill left when
he made his memorable swim.
With a powerful side stroke he contin
ued his journey, heading in a straight
course toward the fort.
The only inconvenience he encountered
was the iish bei'ig carried out by the out
going tide colliding with him. A large
sized porpoise struck him, and became'so
frightened that it jumped nearly live feet
out of the water.
About two-thirds the distance he en
countered the swift tide, and those who
were on the steam launch could see him
exerting all his strength, but no living
man could withstand h current racing at
the rate of ten miles an hour, and he was
carried out for over a mile. He continued
his swimming, but seeing he could make
no headway against such a tide he con
cluded to give up his attempt for the time
being. He signaled to the Jaunch to be
picked np, but the ocrtipants were having
their hands full.
They had just struck the swift current
and despite their powerful engines they
made no headway and came near being
swamped. Putting on all force they
slowly worked their way to the plucky
swimmer and took him aboard.
On their home journey the tide was so
strong that they were only able to go a
quarter of a mile in a half an hour.
Caunhlan'a time for two-thirds the
distance was thirty-one minutes, and had
he started earlier he would have surpassed
Ciivill's time, as it took Cavill over an
hour to make the journey, and that was
made on a more favorable day.
Mr. L'aui>h!an, when seen after his long
swim, said he felt in no way tired, and
had the tide not been so swift would have
succeeded. It is his intention to try
a<:ain a week from next Sunday.
Mr. Caughlan is a graduate of the Uni
versity oi California, of the class of '90,
and played football on his class team.
He is an excellent oarsman and la
possessed of a magnificent physique. He
is twenty-live years of age and a native
son.
The Dolphins had two of their large
boats out, the Wieland and the Arion.
Both boats were crowded with the young
ladies of the club, and they did their
share in encouraging the hardy swimmer.
On board the Wieland were: E. P. Sul
livnn, K. Blennerhassett, T. K. Keenan,
C. M. Farrell, John Marron and Captain
W. O. Patch. On the Arion were: T.
Fitzpatrick, J. Campodonico, J. Caughlan,
G. K. Sullivan and V. Devlin. On the
luunch Ariel were Al Rouard, J. H. Wes
sels antl T. J. Kenny.
The boats were ably commanded by
Commodore J. C. McCarthy.
HANDBALL COURTS.
Several Interesting Games Played in
the Olympic Tournament and
Other Attractions.
The handball courts were crowded yes
terday and the games were of more than
usuai interest. At the San Francisco court
the attraction was a paine in which J. C.
Nealon and P. T. Donnelly, the amateur
champion, played against R. Linehan, the
overhand swiper, C. Bradley and E. Rob
inson. It was closely contested from start
to finish and Isealon and Donnelly won
the final by two nces. Another exciting
game way played, in which G. McDonald
and R. Shea defeated D. Rodgers and Phil
Ryan in a close finish.
The event of the day at the Union court
was a game in which R. Linehan and J.
Nealon played apainst J. Harlow and
Terry McManus, the heavy. weight cham
pion. The two latter were defeated in the
final by three aces. It was one of the
keenest contested games ever played in
the court. C. Bradley of the Occidental
court played a rattling irame against W.
Fnhey and won fhe final by two aces. The
two were very evenly matched.
Several frames were piayed yesterday in
the tournament at the Olympic court in
the first, seeonJ and third classes.
Following were the games played in the
courts yesterday :
