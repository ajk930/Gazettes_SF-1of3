Minister de Lcm^ Asks Americans to
Suspend Judgment Until After
an Investigation.
WASHINGTON* D. C, Dec 13.â Little
else was discussed in Washington among
diplomats and politicians beyond the
tragic death of the insurgent general,
Maceo. The sentiment here among all
classes is decidedly with the insurgents,
and expressions of sympathy were heard
on all sides for the ultimate success of
the Cuban cause. Tie euoject ot Maceo's
death will be brought up in Congress to
morrow, most probably in the Senate,
where several resolutions recognizing
Cuban belligcrancy are pending. It is
less d:fficu!t to brine the subject up there
than in the House, where the rules restrict
action.
Chairman Hittof the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee was not in a position to
night, he said, to discuss the subject of
Maceo's death. The news was too con
flicting and indefinite, and he was in favor
of waiting until the details of the circunir
stances, assuming that Aiaceo is dead, are
received through United States official
channels. Mr. Hitt, because of his promi
nent position, is cautious, and lie voices
tlie general sentiment of the conservative
element of both parties.
Tliere is in botn branches of Congress a
large number wlio are ready to recognize
Cuban belligerency, wnether the Maceo
incident proves correct or not. Senator
liJaufhani nf Louisiana represents this
element when he declared to-nignt that
he was ready at any time to voie for a
resoitrtiofl recognizing the belligerency of
the Cuban?, or, better still, their inde
pendence.
Senator Platt of Connecticut said that
the mendacious character of the news
from Cuba of the past six months and its
utter unreliableness, prevented him from
expressing any opinion in advance of
official information confirming Maceo's
death.
"Nobody knows," he declared, "whether
Maceo is dead or alive; how he met his
death or any of the essential details upon
which to base an intelligent opinion, and
until I do I will not speak as to what
ought to be done or indicate how I will
net."
Senator Thurston of NebrasKa said he
would vole to enter the protest of th:s
Government against the manner of war
fare being carried on in Cuba, and Mc-
Millan of Tennessee and Berry of Ken
tucky favored some action by the Govern
ment which would show to the world that
the United States did not stand idly by
and by its silence approve of the methods
of the Spanish Government against Cuba.
It is not believed that a resolution to in
vestigate the manner in which Meceo met
his death will be offered in Congress.
Even Cuban sympathizers do not think
such a matter is within the power of this
Government, as Maceo is a Spanish sub
ject and his death, if dead, occurred on
Spanish; soil, but it will be within the
province of the United States Consul-Gen
eral at Havana to institute such inquiries
and for Congress to call for and act upon
his report. The matter will doubtless
take this course.
INTESSE LADIONATION.
Maceo'* Murder Caune* Many Men to
Volunteer to Fight Spain.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 13.â The circum
stances attending the death of Com
mander Maceo of the Cuban army have
aroused a feeling of intense indignation in
this city. The stories published in the
morning papers were discussed at the
various clubs and hotels and the opinion
was almost unanimous that Congress
would take summary action during the
coming week. All agreed that the assas
sination of Maceo would do Spain more
harm than eood.
Edward F. Cragin, chairman of the
Cuban Relief Committee of this city, said
to-night: "If this news of Maceo's death
is correct the effect will be to ruin the
cause of Spain. Maceo in death will ac
complish more than in life. This treach
erous, cold-blooded, diabolical murder
places the Spaniards below the Cubans
and removes the last vestige of reason
why we should consider Spanish feelings.
The conservative spirit will not be strong
enough to hold Americans back.
"The vote in Congress where there were
only sixteen in the negative was a fair in
dication of the feeling then, but during
the year that has passed that feeling has
been growing more and more intense. We
may never know just what were the per
suasions used by the Spaniards or what
was the motive of Maceo of going into
their hands 10 confer with them and thus
trust to their honor. I cannot think of
anything unless it was President Cleve
i land's message, as I can conceive of no
linessage of the Spanish Government that
*vouid receive any attention from him,
Wt if the Spaniards should have repre
sented to him that the President of the
United States wanted the war to cease,
and bad suggested that there mixht be
some way to bring it about so that the
honor of Spain could be maintained, and
at the same time satisfactory terms could
be made with Cuba and peace be secured,
The San Francisco Call
1 can see how such an argument might
influence him. 1 hope that one result of
this outrage will be that we will no more
hear of the much-taiked-of pride and
honor of the Spaniards. Senator Cotlum
painted a pretty dark picture, but he
would have painted a darker one had he
known of this treacherous murder."
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 13.â Upon receipt
of the news in this city by the United A -
sociated Presses of the circumstances of
Maceo's death a wave of public indigna
tion arose. It is the absorbing topic of
discussion wherever men gather, and the
treachery of the Spanish general is con
demned in the strongest language. It is
well known that Si. Louis is the western
depot of the Cuban Junta, and inquiries
pour in upon every one supposed to bfi â¢
connected with the Cuban cause as to the
means of enlisting in the Cuban army.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 13.â A Cuban
insurgent recruiting orlice has been opened
at the Grand Central Hotel here. The
man in charge of the oth'ce seems to have
plenty of money. He is engaging non
commissioned otlicers of the Seventeenth
Regiment, United States army, located
h?re as they are discharged on the expira
tion of their terms of enlistment, paying
them $50 per month. A detachment of
ten will leave here next week, going by
way of New Orleans.
PLEA OF MINISTER DE LOME.
Ash* the American People to \Suspend
Their Jmtysnriit.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 13.-The
Spanish Minister, Mr. Dupuy de Lome,
expressed the hope to-day that the Amer
ican people wil! suspend judgment regard
ing the reported assassination of Maceo
until the real facts are known. He ridi
culed the statement that the Vice Captain-
General, Ahuniada, could be a party to
such an occurrence, and believes that there
are a sufficient number of reputable cor
respondents in Havana to investigate
these charges fairly and publish the re
sult. The statements of the Junta, which,
he says, bear the stamp of absurdity upon
their face, are made to neutralize the effect
of the President's- messa^n and to create
sympathy with their failing cause.
"We have been accused repeatedly," he
said, "of circulating the report of Maceo's
death to affect the action of Congress. It
is quite reasonable to assume that Maceo
is known to be dead; that the Junta is
originating reports of his death by treach
ery for the same reason."
WILL AGAIN ENTER THE FIELD.
Weyler Hoes >Â«t Want Assistant Assat-
tins to Get All the Glory.
HAVANA, Cvba, Dec. 13.â Official ad
vices from the province oi Pinar del Rio
are to the effect that Colonel Feijoo, act
ing under orders from Captain-General
Weyler, left Campo Florida, near Havana,
on FridayÂ»and went in search of the rebels,
under Aguirre, Castillo, Arangnren and
other leaders. The insurgents, compris
ing 1200 cavalry, were found at La Luz
ranche and were attacked and defeated.
The Spanish troops pursued them and
â¢several rights occurred at other point?, in
which the rebels were invariably defeated.
In all theÂ«e encounters the rebels lost
seven killed and four wounded.
On Saturday Colonel Feijoo's command
met a body oi rebels at Tumba Cuatro and
dislodged them from their positions. The
insurgents left eleven dea<i on the field
ami carried many wounded with them on
their retreat. The Spanish loss was nine
teen wounded.
The Havana Volunteers organized a
grand torch-light procession and unarmed
demonstration in honor of General Wey
ler to-night. Large crowds were out to
witness the demonstration. The pnraders,
who were accompanied by several bands
of music, marched through the principal
streets and then proceeded to the palace
where a great crowd had assembled.
General Weyler was most enthusiastically
cheered, and there were many cries of
"Long live the King," "Long live Spain,"
and other patriotic phrases.
A number of speeches were made in
which the speakers expressed the greatest
loyalty to crown and country and urged
their hearers to lay down tlieir lives if
necessary for the honor of Spain. All
the speakers were cheered to the eci.o.
After the speeches the demonstration
ended.
General Weyler will return to the
province of Pinar del Rio this week.

DALLAS, Tex., Dec. 13.â Two thou
sand persons assembled in mass meeting
at the city hall to-day and organized the
Cuban Aid Association of Dallas. More
than 400 men put their names on
the roll of "active" membership.
Andrew Jackson Houston, a son of bam
Houston, the Texas liberator, presided.
Strong speeches in favor of Cuban inde
pendence and war with Spain, if neces
sary, were made and resolutions indors
ing the position of United States Senator
Mills, as stated in his recent resolutions
in Congress, were adopted; also a resolu
tion deploring the death of General An
tonio Maceo.
Copies of the proceedings were ordered
sent to Tomas Estrada Palma, New York
City, the Texas delegations in both houses
of Congress and both branches of the
State Legislature.
The wildest enthusiasm was shown dur
ing the proceedings. The association ad
journed until to-morrow night. Many
letter* and telegrams were received from
prominent Cubans and Cuban sympa
thizers in and out of Texr.s, and many
telegrams were sent out after adjourn
ment.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Dec 13.â There in
but one sentiment in this country regard
ing the assassination of General Maceo.
Indignation is freely and emphatically
expressed whenever and wherever the
matter is discussed, and there has been
some talk of a mass-meeting for the pur
pose of giving public expression regarding
the killing of Maceo, and formulating a
petition asking that the United States
recognize the belligerency of Cuban in
surgent*. Maceo's assassination is re
garded as a violation of the rules of war
fare.

NOW EULOGIZES MACEO.
Hut Weyler Did Jfaf I'rrvent the Brutal
As* assignation.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 13 âThe Her
ald's special cable di-palch from Havana
gives the following account of an inter
view with General Weyler on Saturday
ni-ht:
"What can you say of President Cleve
land's message?" 1 asked.
"Nothing â absolutely nothing. I am a
military man â not a politician. I can
only say I have no feeling against Mr.
Cleveland or any other Pre-idont."
I asked Captain-General Weyler to ex
press an opinion regarding Antonio Ma
ceo. He said :
"Maceo was a brave man and, I thought,
a great general until the Pinar del Rio
campaign. To-day I believe him to have
been a brave man of great prestige, a
fighter all through and a man who cannot
be replaced by the Insurgents â in fact he
was their main stay â and Gomez, who is
an old man, would not have come to Cuba
at all except for Maceo."
Speaking again of Maceo General Weyler
said lie regarded the rebel leader as the
most apt person of the insurrection, and
he added: "'I went to Pinar del Rio my
self to cope with him and thought he
would await me in his position, which he
did not."
The general added that Maceo was dead
beyond doubt.
WATCHING THE LACRADA.
Great Esrcltement in Spain Over the Fill'
hunter'^ t.r.pected Arrival .
LONDON, Ekg., Dec. 13.â The Morning
Post to-morrow will print a statement by
the lteute'rs Telegram Company that the
vessel signaled off Valencia; Spain, yester
day, was not the ex-filibuster Laurada.
The vessel is not ejected to arrive at
Valencia until Monday, jier consignee
has disclaimed her cargo. ' â  ' .
If this statement is true it furnished an
effective denial to a dispatch alleged to
have been sent from Madrid to the Chi
cago Associated Press denying the dis
patches of the United Associated Presses
that the Laurada intended to call at Valen
cia after sailing from Messina.'
Reuters Telegram Company is appar
ently not aware of the fact that the Chi
cago Associated Press, which in a way
represents the former concern in the
United States, had emphatically denied
the truth of the United Associated Presses
dijpatcnes and had explained that the
Valencia referred to was Valencia, Venezu
ela, and not Valencia, Spain. Otherwise
the British concern would not now say
that the Laurada was not expected at
Valencia, Spain, until Monday night and
that her consignee had refused to accept
the responsibility for her cargo. As a
matter of fact the Madrid dispatch of the
Chicago Associated Press, or th? greater
portion of it, was not sent from Madrid,
or if it was it was expanded in New York
to suit the end which the Chicago Asso
ciated Press had in view â that is, to deny
the truth of tne news it is not in a posi
tion to < over.
VALENCIA, Spain, Dec. 13.â A mistake
was made in reading the signals displayed
by a vessel which arrived off mis port yes
terday and as a result it was announced
that the notorious filibustering steamer
Laurada, which has carried men and arms
to Cuba to aid the insurgents, was coming
into port from Messina, whither she had
gone on a regular voyage. The statement
that sucn a vessel would come into a Span
ish port aroused much indignation, as was
cabled at the time to the United Asso
ciat d Presses. The report caused the
greatest excitemeut among the populace
and it was leared that if sbe came into the
harbor an attack would be made upon her.
The forpe of police and military was in
creased in order to suppress any orertact
against a vessal under the American flag.
The crntser Marie Theresa arrived here
to re-enforce tne coast guard vessels, which
will keep a close watch upon the Laurada
when she arrives.
The authorities have decided not to for*
[ With apologies to Sarah Grand.]
bil the Laurada entering the harbor. She
will be allowed to enter the port and
anchor alongside a warship, but will not
be permitted to approach the wharves for
the purpose of landing. Much satisfaction
has been afforded the Spanish Govern
ment by the action of the Washington
Government in advising the captain of
the Laurada not to insist upon taking a
cargo on board at Valencia or otbe
Spanish por:s. The excitement over the
expected arrival of the steamer ia very
high to-day, and it is now thought that no
international complications will follow.
THEACHERY OF APANIARDS.

Irnr* War.
/, JACKSONVILLE, Dec. 13.â The ,
Cubans of this city will to-morrow night
hold a torchlight â  procession , and mass
meeting of citizens to express their indig
nation at the murder of General Maceo
and the methods of warfare practiced by
the Spaniards under. General Weyler in j
Cuba. Speeches, will be made by promi
nent Americans as well as by Cubans. ,4^.^
Joaquin Fortune, the president of El
Circulo Cubana and one of the representa
tives of the junta in Florida, said to-day:
"The cowardly murder of gallant Maceo
by the Spaniards does not go very far to
prove the splendid Datriotism and chiv
alry of the Spaniards mentioned in the
President's message."
He gave several instances of Spanish
treachery during the last tenlyears' war
in Cuba and recalled that when Generals
Jose Maceo, GuiJlermo, Moncada and
Quentin Bandera celebrated a treaty
of peace with Spain in 1878 they were
promised that if they laid down their
arras they and their families would be
permitted to embark for Santiago de Cuba
and the Government would pay their pas
sago to any country they wished to go.
They embarked, but all were immediately
put in chains and sent to African prisons.

BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 13.â Rear -Admiral
Belknap, retired, of Brookline, in an in
terview on the assassination of Maceo,
said to-day that lie never heard of a more
cownrdly act, that it was not war but
assassination; that the United States and
every civilized nation should interfere, and
that Congress would probably acton the
matter on Monday, which would not be
too soon.
RAINES LAW VIOLATORS.
They Are Vigorously Scored at a Meeting
of the Temperance Union.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 13.â At a
meeting of the American Temperance
Union, which was held in Chickering
Hall and at which Rev. Dr. C. H. Mead,
president of the union, presided, Rev. Dr.
I. J. Funk, editor of the Voice, denounced
the Kaines law, Senator Raines, city offi
cials and police officers of this city and
Brooklyn nnd charged officers appointed
under the Raines law with neglectaf duty.
He demanded the dismissal of some of the
officials, especially ot Commissioner of
Police Wells of Brooklyn, who, he said,
should be sent to the penitentiary for
trading off law for votes. Dr. Funk said
in part:
"It is a cross trifling witn the public.
It is a roaring farce for Senator Raines
and his committee to come here and ask
whether the Raines law has been violated
and why it has not been enforced. That
law has been violated on all sides ever
since it has been put in force, with the
knowledge ot Senator Raines, with the
knowledge of every newspaper man in the
State, with the guilty knowledge of the
police, the Superintendent of Buildings of
New Yorfc and Brooklyn and with the
guilty knowledge of the District Attorneys
and most inex cusabie of all the officers ap
pointed under law to see its enforce
ment."
A report from inspectors of the union
showing violation of law and order in this
city was read.

DUNHAM SEEN
BELOW THE LINE
Men Who Worked for Him
Say There Can Be No
Mistake.
Their Information Led to the
Gathering of Officers at
San Diego.
One of Detective Gard's Force Dc
cares That the Fugitive Is
Located.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 13.â Sheriff
Lyndon of Santa Clara County arrived
here to-night and registered at the Thorn
ton House under an assumed name. He
was met by George E. Gard, ex- United
States Marshal, who has been here since
yesterday. They conferred for a long
time to-night and refused to bejinterviewed.
Mr. Gard said he had nothing to add to
what he told The Call correspondent last
n lght, wh icb was that he was on a "Quien
Sabe case" which would turn out big if it
turned out anything.
Though Mr. Gard Is very close-mouthed,
as an officer should be, a local officer who
has been working with him is not so
shrewd. From him while he wa^ drinking
with a few friends enough was learned to
give a good idea of what the officers are
after. Word was received from the San
Rafael Valley, Lower California, throe
weeks ago that a stranger, supposed to be
Dunham, the Campbell murderer, had
been seen at a camp in the mountain.
San Rafael is about 150 miles south of
here, in a thinly settled portion of the
peninsula. The stranger first attracted
attention to bimseif by showing too much
concern for the people who approached.
He came out of his cabin and scrutinized
everybody, and was never seen without a
rifle. His face resembled Dunham's, ex
cept that he was smooth shaven.
Two weeks ago the man disappeared
and was afterward seen on his way north,
riding a mule. He told persons whom he
met that he was prospecting. He was un
communicative and had a suspicious man
ner that attracted attention. That was
the last seen of Him, so far as known here,
nnless the officers have received later
word, which is doubtless the case.
About the time that the straneer was
seen on the mountain side a couple of
Mexicans told an American, who was in
Lower California hunting, that they had
seen Dunham. They had worked for him
on his bee ranch at Duizura and knew
him well. They said he was hiding down
there, and paid an occasional visit to his
ranch, always in the night. They thought
he went to meet some one there.
Adjoining the ranch on the eastern end
is a long, deep canyon, which cuts south
ward find extends for several miles, heav
ily covered by underbrush. This canyon
was thoroughly explored by the officers
last July. Marshal Gard was one of the
party at that time. The canyon runs
from the ranch as far south as the Mexi
can line, and even a short distance into
Mexico. This has been regarded by the
officers as an ideal hiding-place, and a
number of them have held that sooner or
later Dunham would be found in that vi
cinity, on account of bis intimate knowl
edge of the country and the haudiness of
the Mexican border.
In addition to these facts, it was learned
to-day that a person alleged to be a 33 r ounger
brother of Dunham was here last week.
He paid a visit to the ranch. Officers fol
lowed every step he took, and failed to
find anything suspicious about his move
ments; but they believe that he might
have sent wcrd somehow to his outlawed
brother and that the ranch might be a
rendezvous where the fugitive could find
money or provisions when hard pushed.
It is these points that have led to the
meeting of Marshal Gard, Bheriff Lyndon
and local officers in this city. Tne utmost
secrecy is being observed by all but one,
and his talk, if it. reaches Gard's ears, will
end his connection with the hunt. The
intention cf the party, it is believed, is to
locate the man suspected to be Dunham
and get a view of him if possible.
Then, if his hiding-ulace is below the
line, Mexican aid must be enlisted, as the
kidnapin? business would not be tolerated
by either Government. The chase is ex
ceedingly delicate from the fact that the
talk of $20,000 reward has stirred up every
one to lever heat, and somebody is likely
to inadvertently put Dunham on his
guard. The officer who gave away all that
has been learned so iar said to-night:
"We're after big game. There is $10,000
in it, and we'll eet him alive or dead. He
may get one of us, but we are too many
for him. We've cot him located all rieht
nnd he'll be there when we go after him.
There is no mistake about the man, either,
because he is known here like a book."
SUSPECT ARRENTED AT SILAO.
Believed by Ouadnlnjara Officer* to Be
Fugitive Dunlinm.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Dec. 12.â Sheriff Lyn
don left this city yesterday, and it is pre
sumed that he left for the south, but no
information in that connection could be
obtained at the Sheriff 's office. The depu
ties refused to discuss the matter, but it
was lenrned from outside sources that the
Sheriff's errand is to follow up a supposed
clew as to the whereabouts of James C.
Dunham, the murderer of the McGlincy
family.
It is probabl6 that Sheriff Lyndon's des
tination is the State of Guadalajara, Mex
ico. There is a well-anlhenticated story
that a man said to be Dunham was ar
rested by a police agent at Silao, Mexico,
a few weeks ago. The suspect had an
assumed name and was keeping himself
in hiding in his hotel as much as possible.
The officers of Silao had pictures of Dun
ham and several, of them were positive
that the prisoner wns the Campbell mur
derer, but the police chief, for some un
known reason, ordered the release of the
suspect. The supposed murderer imme
diately left Silao and started for Guadala
jara.
Efforts to have the suspect again appre
hended have been unavailing, as the
Mexican Government has issued a circular
warning that no arrests shall be made on
the recommendation of police agents
unless authorized by the Minister of P'or
eign Affairs. It is believed that Sheriff
Lyndon has received information as to
the suspect's present whereabouts and has
gone to Mexico after Mm.
BOGGS IN TACOMA 'S JAIL.
The Ex-Treasurer Brought Back From
Spokane in Charge of a
Sheriff.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 13.â George W.
Boggs, ex-City Treasurer of Tacoma, re
turned to-day from Spokane in the cn?
tody of Sheriff Parker, who had apparently
forgotten that Boggs promised when he
went away to return any time that Parker
wired for him. Boggs endeavored to keep
his word, and was trying to secure trans
portation home when the Sheriff met him
Friday on the street at Spokane. Boggs
seems as hapj>y .and jolly as ever, rie
does not act like one expecting to spend
six years at hard labor in the Walla Walla
prison, but he says:
"I am here to obey the court's man
dates and if they say 'go to Walla Walla,'
why, I go. Of course I had rather stay
here, but the sooner this is over the bet
ter."
He was taken to the County Jail this
afternoon and ttiere met his attorneys and
several friends, who called to tell him to
brace ujv The ex-Treasurer did not need
this advice, for of the entire group he
seemed the most unconcerned.
His attorneys are Judge Fremont Camp
bell and L. C. Dennis To-day it was an
nounced that they will ask the Supreme
Court to rehear the ense on which Its re
cent decision that Boggs must go to prison
was based. Failing in this they will mase
efforts in a different direction to keep h m
out of Walla Walla.

"LONG GREEN"
An Examiner Reporter
Wagered a Large Sum
on Sharkey.
PLAYED IN SMALL
AMOUNTS.
The Agent His Been Andy
Lawrence's Man Friday
for Years Past.
POOLROCM3 VISITED JU3T BE
FORE THE FIGHT.
This Simo Man Brought Earp to
"Long Green" to Be Engaged
as a Bodyguard.
The career of Long Green Lawrence of
the Examiner is now freeiy discussed,
apropos of the disreputable part he p:ayed
in the Sharkey-FiU'simmons fight. Facts
are coming to light day by day ihat show
beyond ali question that Fitzsimmons was
jobbed in the fight and that tne manag
ing editor of the Examiner was deeply
implicated in the plot.
Wyatt Earp was appointed referee of
the Fitzsimmo:is-Sharkey fight at tne di
rect instance of Andy Al. Lawrence, bet
ter known as "Long Green," erstwhile
peanut butcher and now managing editor
of Mr. Hearst's Examiner. In the first
flush after t^e decision Mr. Gibhs admitted
this. He unquestionably told the truth
then, and his subsequent evasion was the
result of an enforced interview in thje Ex
aminer editorial rooms, in which he was
warned not to admit the truth again at
the peril of his reputation and the lash of
the journalistic bully on Mission street.
There are many peopleâ prominent in
every walk of life â who know what it
means to be "invited" to visit the journal
istic Czar. Many proad and spirited men
have gone thither defiantly and gone out
crushed and crestfallen. The smallest
blow-hole in a man's armor is sufficient; to
make him bend to the wishes of that
newspaper.
When the Examiner wants anything it
sends for a man, and *-hen it sends for
him it usually has a disreputable way of
convincing him that he was wrong in his
previous preierences and that the bully of
Mission street is right. So came Gibbs,
the other half of the National Athletic
Club, the day of the fight, in the after
noon. He went away convinced that
Wyatt Earp ought to be the referee oi the
ti^ht; that he must be the referee. He
was the referee. To ths better under
standing of the peculiar selection of Mr.
Earp, The Call is able to give a little in
side history, antedating the fight, but
serving as a connecting link, as significant
as it is indisputable. The story goes back
to last summer, when Dave Neagle made
his assault on James H. Barry, the editor
of the Star. The Examiner denounced
Neagle's conduct. His character was
painted in colors deep und red and the
hiring of "a Daid assassin" was an act
held up to the scorn and the loathing of
the people. The readers of The Call will
bring to mind the pictures which bubbled
out ali over the Examiner about that time.
The main point at issue was the hiring
as a paid guard a man whose chief recom
mendation rested on the iaeff that he was
â¢'a killer."
The honesty and consistency of the Ex
aminer is beautifully illustrated by the
sequel.
The tyranny of the Mission-sreet bully
is hedged about by cowardice. The dun
which he occupies is provided with intri

TREATING THE WRONG
DISEASE.
How large bills are run up without
benefit to the sufferer.
Many times women call on their family
physicians, suffering, as they imagine, one
from dyspepsia, another from nervous dis-
ease, another from liver or kidney disease,
another with pain here and there, and in
this way they all present alike to them-
selves and their easy-going, indifferent, or
over-busy doctors, separate and distinct dis-
eases, for which they prescribe their pills
and potions, assuming them to be such,
when, in reality, they are all only symptoms
caused by some womb disease The physi-
cian ignorant of the cause of suffering, en-
courages his practice until large bills are
made. The suffering patient gets no better,
but probably worse, by reason of the delay,
wrong treatment and consequent complica-
tions. A proper medicine, like Dr. Pierce ' 3
Favorite Prescription, directed to the cause
would have entirely removed the disease,
thereby dispelling all those distressing
symptoms, and instituting comfort instead
of prolonged misery. It has been well said,
that "a disease known is half cured."
Dr. Pierce s Favorite Prescription is a
scientific medicine, carefully compounded
by an experienced and skillful physician,
and adapted to woman's delicate organiza-
tion. It cures all derangements, irregu-
larities and weaknesses of the womanly
organs. It is purely vegetable in its com-
position a"d perfectly harmless in its ef-
fects in at?.' condition of the system. For
morning sickness, or nausea, due to preg-
nancy- weak stomach, and kindred symp-
toms* :ts use, will prove very beneficial. It
also makes childbirth easy by preparing
the system for parturition, thus assisting
Nature and shortening ' ' labor. " The period
of confinement is also greatly shortened,
the mother strengthened and built up, and
an abundant op^^tion of nourishment for
the child promoted. Sold by ail dealers.2
cate compartments, convenient and de
ceptive screens, unexpected traps and
hidden photographic cameras. (iuards
are stationed at the inner and outsr doors
of the main office, readied only by three
tiresome flights of stairsâ a climb likely
to cool and discourage the most enraged
man. Just off the room of the outer
guard, where Charlie Rochette. the prize
fighter, did service for many years, is a
waiting-room, comfortably furnished, with
entrances and exits directly into the
lobby and the editorial rooms.
It was into this side room, commanding
both the inner sanctum and the outer en
trance, that Wyatf Earp, the greatest liv
ing representative of border ruffianism,
was installed as bodyguard-in-chief at
this time. He was hired by Long Green
Lawrence as his special guard. He was
placed on the payroll of the Examiner at
that time, and it is believed that he re
mained on Mr. Hearst's payroll up to the
time of the now famous fight.
So while tiie Examiner was denouncing
the hiring of Neagle it was all the while
employing Earp in the same capacity. It
was certainly a case of unparalleled
hypocrisy. Earp was employed in this
way: The races were off ; characters of his
kind were either "broke" or out of town
and "grasa was uncommonly short."
While lounging in front of the Peerless
saloon he was approached by one of Law
rence' 3 henchmen and asked if he would
not like to earn a little money easily.
Earp intimated that he would be glad
of a chance to make money Dy almost any
means short of holding up 'a train or a
stage. The reporter tola him that Mr.
Lawrence desired to see him, and the two
proceeded togetner to the Mission-street
structure. A deal was made at $50 a week,
it is hinted, and Earp was instatlei in the
sanctum as chief swa?hbuckler, with
headquarters in the ante-room, though he
was also permitted to enjoy the privileges
of the inner temple upon occasions.
Meantime Earp also shadowed Lawrence
about town and from and to his home.
It will be noted that a confidential rela
tion existed between Lawrence and Earp
long previous to the fight, and that when
lie suggested Earp's name as referee of the
fight he was giving a place to his own em
ploye and a man whom he well knew and
largely owned.
It might be stated, too, that Earp did
not appear on the payroll of the Exam
iner as a bodyguard, but as a library at
tache. He was paraded and widely adver
tised as the author of a serial Sunday
story, descriptive of his valorous deeds
and general outlawry. These stories were
written by young Chambers, a special
writer, whom Mr. Hearst imported from
New York. It was under the guise of
pay for these stories that Earp figured on
the payroll. Whether this was done to
hoodwink bluff Tom Williams, the Exam
iner's business manager, or to deceive
young Hearst has not been explained. It
is a mystery that Mr. Hearst will prob
ably solve for himself.
A singular feature of the case is that evi
dence is daily accumulating that Long
Green Lawrence was concerned in and
directly benefited by the steal that robbed
Bob Fitzsimmons of a well-earned victory
and $10,000.
Those who have watched the gradual
expose of the crookedness of Long Green
and his henchman and bodyguard, Wyatt
Earp, have wondered how long it would be
before something direct and substantial
would show the unmistakable smudge of
Long Green's eager fingers.
The evidence is at hand and, moreover,
wili be made public in the hearing of the j
case as it progresses before Judge Sander- I
son.
Of course, no one doubted that little
Willies pet editor was a pot of money in
pocket over the- steal perpetrated by the
border ruffian wnom he caused to have
appointed referee of the fight.
It is now known positively that a mem
ber of the Examiner reportorial staff â a
man whom Long Green has kept on the (
paper when other powers of the Exam- j
iner wanted him discharged â bet a large j
sum of money on Sharkey in the pool
rooms during the three hours preceding
the tight.
This man has for years been to Long
Green what Friday was to Robinson Cru
soe â always at his side ready to do his
bidding in anything. It was he who
acted as tne go- between 1 when Lawrence
engaged bad man Earp as his bodyguard
and brought him to the Examiner sanc
tum for the first interview. This man is
known to be in a continual state of finan
cial collapse. He has nothing outside of
the salary he earns running errands for
Long Green, and yet he fcei hundreds on
fcbÃrkey at a time when the poolrooms
were crowded and be would be least likely
to be noticed, and about the time that a
tip that the ftght was fixed saved a num
ber of sporting men from serious loss.
The money was certainly not bis own,
and if this was the case who else would
give him a big commission to execute but
Long Green ?
The poolrooms were jammed witn an j
eager crowd of spectators when Long i
Green's factotum appeared. He edged up
to the box where Fitzsimmons money was !
plentiful and out of a pocket that jingled
musically produced a shining $20 and
placed it on Sharkey to win.
Those who knew him wondered where
be got so much money and their surprise
was increased when $10 more went into
the box on the sailor man. Then he
edged away for a moment, but was soon
b ck and bet $40 on the sailor.
The crowd was continually shifting as
its bets were made, but Lawrence's agent
kept close to the box and inside of an hour
bet several hundred dollars on SharkeV.
There were other men known to be in the
confidence of Long Green close to the box
and likewise betting amounts ranging
from $1.0 to $50.
Now that the connection of Earo and
Long Green has been conclusively shown
those who saw the bets made will never be
convinced that the Examiner's ex-peanut
butcher was not the one who furni-hed the
coin that the reporter bet on Sharkey. It
is also known that he made a number of
wagers about town, in saloons and else
where on the fight during the half day that
preceded it.
The Long Green crowd knew that to
send in a big commission as honest sports
did would be to invite suspicion in case
the steal was raw, and they chose this
method of "chipping" their money in and
cashing a big bunch of tickets when the
box was opened for those who profited by
the robbery.
By the way, it was not the lamented
EJdie Farrell who gave Lawrence his
cognomen, but Frank P. Bull, who de
clared that Andy tried to "pull his leg"
for $10,000 in the legislative session. Tn'at
is an interesting affidavit, even if Bull
didn't yield the "long irreen."

Does Not Relish Exposure
of Scandals Among
O.ficers.
Major Tausch of the Political
Police Is Quite Willing
to Confess.
But Higher Officials Implicate! la
His Pecu'iar Fl.ts Are Hea
ing Off Publicity.
[Copyright, 1896. by the United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Germany, Dec. 13.â The
statement published in the Reichsanzei
ger, the official journal, that so long ago
as October the Kaiser was informed of
tne source of the libels against Freiherr
Marschali yon Bieberstein, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, is taken as proof that the
prosecution of both Baron yon Lueizow,
the editor who a few days ago was sen
tenced to eighteen months' imprisonment
for perjury and forgery, and Major Baron
yon Tausch, the chief of the political
police, who is now in jail awaiting trial
for perjury and forgery and also for aiding
and abetting others in the commission of
those crimes, has received the full sanc
| tion of the Emperor.
The conservative newspapers are rather
reticent concerning the latter, knowing
that the dominant influence in the Em
peror's entourage is now that of Baron
Marschali yon Bieberstein. One imme
diate and practical effect of the prosecu
tions has been' the cessation of inspired
utterances in the newspapers. The court
and Government officials now evade and
ignore journalists and the office of the
court marshal even refuses cards of ad
mission to any court festivities, which
have hitherto been regularly accorded to
members of the press. Only August de
Grahl, a member of the official bureau,
will henceforth be admitted to these func
tions, and his report must be bought by
the papers that want reports of the move
ments of the Emperor and his court. It
is only the independent papers that are
now trying to penetrate the mystery re
maining around the prosecutions.
The Tageblatt in an article on the sub-
ject says that the trial and conviction and
sentence of Baron yon Luetzow was a
mere prologue to the political drama of
which the trial of Baron yon Tausch will
be the central development. The Lokal
Anzeiger asserts that after his arrest
Tauscii offered to reveal everything, eveii
to the disclosure of the names of the per
sons who were behind him and inspired
the acts of which he now stands accused.
The National Zeitung insists that the
Government shall institute at once an en
ergetic purification of the police. None of
the independent papers, however, is so
I boldly explicit as tbe Vorwaerts, the lead
{ ing organ of the Socialist party, which is
i daily howling in triumph over tiie down
fall of its old enemy, Baron yon Tausch.
Hitherto the Socialists have denied that
Buron Marschali yon Biebersteiu was pos
sessed of any grit, and their present sup
port of him causes trus Germans to doubt
whether he was well advised in forcing
for his own interests the most extreme
publicity of matters in regard to the dis
j sensions and sources of dissensions within
i the Government, and especially official
I circles are asking whether the welfare of
I the public would not have been better
served through some other mode of in
quiry, say by bringing disciplinary pro
. ceediugs against Tausch for abuse of bis
office. The Vorwaerts, sarcastically point
ing out the fact that Baron Marschali yon
Bieberstein pretends to believe that
Tausch had no cue behind mm, adds:
"Yon Bieberstein is altogetner 100
clever and too well informed not to
know the whole affair to its root. As
a matter of fact nobody acquainted
with the court or high official circles
credits the Eulenburg family with Having
instructed Tausch directly to operate
a.ainat Yon Bieberstein, but ail ol tne
court know what tremenUous influence
the Eulenburgs wield. Tneir princely po
s-tion and wealth influence all German
and Austrian courts, and it is now a diffi
cult matter to conceive that a creature like
Tausch did not need any explicit orders
to act in the Eulen burgs' interests."
la conclusion the Vorwaerts says: "If
the trial of Major yon Tausch is not to be
a farce Baron Mar.-cinul yon Bieberstein
must insist upon exculpation through the
cleverest methods, proceeding not alone
against Count yon Eulenburg, but also
j against General yon Waitiersee, Prince
: Bismarck and Count Herbert Bismarck."
Herr Bebel, the Socialist leader in the
j Reichstag, has written an open letter, in
| which he alludes to the "trinity of con
spirators" behind Taus-ch and declares
that he will lay the statement upon the
subject before the Reichstag.
Tiie world outside of Germany possibly
fails to conceive of the awful impression
made by the revelations concerning the
weakness ot the Government, and espe
cially the disclosure-) of the Kaiser's sub
jection to possibly corrupt and unpatri
otic influences, which give a sense of the
insecurity of ti<e Fatherland that has
never been felt before.
The new bourse laws which will go into
effect on January 1. which were only pub
lished apart troiu the bill on Wednesday
last, excite the greatest discontent among
bourse operators.
Disentangled from the verbiage of tiie
act it is recognized on all sides that the
regulations cannot be made workable,
and bankers and dealers alike concur in
the opinion that it is impossible to see
how a law insisting upon registration of
bourse transactions can be made opera
tive. Most of the bankers have decided to
do business with their clients alter Janu
ary 1 precisely as they did before, and
then test the question in courts as to time
operations being unlawful.

SLAIN BY A BURGLAR.
Murder of a Young lowa Farmer Who
Grappled With an Early Morning
Intruder.
MARSH ALLTOWM, lowa, Dec. 13.â
Andrew Hart, living near LamoUle with
his parents, was murdered by an unknown
burglar, whom he surprised in the act of
pilferiue the house early this morning.
The affair has caused intense excite
meut throughout this locality, and a
posse with bloodhounds is now in pursuit
of the deperado, with indications that he
will soon be captured. The circumstances
surrounding tbe affair are as follows:
Young Hart is a farmer about 25 years of
age and worked for his parents. One of
his duties was to light the fires in the
morning, and he arose this morning as
usual to perform his duty. On reaching
the bottom of a flight of stairs which lead
to his sleeping apartment lie was heard to
say: "What are you doing there?" He
had surpris&d a burglar.
A scuffle followed which lasted about a
minute, when the robber drew a revolver
and fired two shots, both of which took
effect in the heart, killing his victim in
stantly. Other members of the family
heard the shots and hurried to his assist
ance, but were too late to assist the young
man. Hardly had the report of the shots
died away when men were in pursuit of
the murderer. In his haste to escape the
assassin jumped through a window, break
ing the sash and glass into fragments. He
was traced into a cornfieid, and must have
been badly cut by the broken glass, as he
left many blood marks on the stalks.
Neighbors and friends soon gathered, the
Sheriff was summoned and a posse was
sent in pursuit of the desperado.
Later bloodhounds were put on the
track and every effort is being made to
capture the man. Up to a late hour this
evening they had not been successful. The
Harts are old settlers in this vicinity and
are highly respected. The whole neigh
borhood is aroused and 500 men are in
pursuit with shotguns and revolvers, and
assert that the murderer will be lynched
if captured.
DEEDS OF A NEGRO LAD.
Crazed by Disappointment in Love Young
Edward Brooks Runs Amuck, Shoot
ing Five Persons.
WACO, Tex., Dec. 13.â Edward Brooks,
a colored bootblack, aged 17, ran amuck
last night with a revolver in his hand and
sbot five persons, one fatally. He started
on the east side of the city by shooting
two colored men, inflicting flesh wounds.
Leaving them he tried to shoot a woman,
but tbe pistol failed to work. He then
tooK a streetcar and went to the Baptist
Tabernacle, where he shot two more col
ored men, one in the leg and the other in
the arm. Going a mile farther he went to
a house where a dance given by colored
people was in progress and shot another
man, killing him instantly. The name of
the man killed is Alexander Wiilis. The
wounded men are Jake Wedley, Charles
Woodward. Gene Townsend and Willie
Nichols.
Shortly after Brooks shot Alexander
Willis he was captured by the police, just
as he was in the act of shooting another
man. The theory is that Brooks was
crazed by love for a girl who did not
reciprocate his passion. Until the present
mad performances he was regarded as a
quiet, industrious boy.

. WINONA, Minn., Dec. 13.â Jonathan
Carver, one of the first explorers of the
Northwest, makes mention in one of his
books of a large cave with walls covered
with Indian picture writing , near the
southern boundary of Minnesota. A Wi
nona scientist has just located this cave
and it has been thoroughly explored. It
is at Lamoille, sixteen miles south of
here. â â¢/ â  . . \ -
The entrance to the cavern" is semi
circular, fifty feet wide ! and twenty feet
high. Upon entering the fact is discov
ered that the cave is a large room, oblong
in shape. This chamber is 100 feet lons,
running from side to side, and about sev
enty feet in width. The root arches to a
height of nearly twenty-five leet. The
walls are found to be a mass of Indian
writings.. ,
Among the figures is that, of a man
nearhr six feet lone and well proportioned.
A space where the wnter has prevented
people from marring it is literally covered
with drawings of raccoons, eagles, mu ck
rats, beaver?, rattlesnakes of all lengths,
birds, buffalo heads and ho ts of other
animal?. The pictures are beyond a doubt
the work of Indian tribes, mostly the
Sioux, who lived in the region for cen
turies.

VACANCIES IN THE
ARMY AND NAVY
They Must Be Filled Soon
After McKinley Be

Several High 0 ficers May Re
tire Prematurely to Give
Cleveland a Chance.
Twj Adm ra's, Two Commodores, a
M j)r-General anl Several Briga
diers to Bs Named.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec I&âlm
mediately following the accession of Mr.
McKinley to the Presidential chair he will
be called upon to fill a large number of
vacancies of importance in the army and
navy. Soon after his inauguration he
will appoint two general officers of the
army as well as successors to Admiral*
Walker and Ramsay.
During the tint year of his administra
tion he must select successors to a chief
of engineers in the War Department, an
adjutant-general and commissary-general,
oesides one major-general and one briga
dier. In the navy he must appoint a new
chief of the Lighthouse Boar*, chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, commandant for
the Norfolk Navy-yard, commandant of
the Newport station and a new superin
tendent of the Naval Observatory. Before
his term expires he will have at his dis
posal twenty vacancies in high of
fices in the army and about the same
number in the navy. The first military
vacancy to be filled will be occasioned by
the retirement on April 2of Major-Gen
eral Ruger, commanding the Department
of the East. The expectation is that Gen
eral Merritt will be na^med. On May 8
Brigadier-General Wheaton retires and it
is believed that Colonel Wade of the Fifth
Cavalry will succeed him. On July 1
General Craighill, chief of engineers, will
retire.
A story was in circulation a few days
ago that General Craighill may apply for
retirement before the 4th of next March,
in order that President Cleveland may ap
point Colonel ''Jack" Wilson, at present
the efficient Superintendent of the Public
Buildings and Grounds in Washington.
Colonel Wilson was the superintendent of
the West Point military academy, and is
one of the most popular officers in tbe
array. His ability for the office is con
ceded on every hand.
A vacancy in the staff will be caused by
the retirement of Adjutant-General Rug
gles. and it is supposed that Colonel Sam
uel Breck, at present assistant adjutant
general, will succeed him. On January
18 General Morgan, the present commis
sary general, will retire, and wiil probably
be succeeded by Colonel Morgan, who, re
tiring the following November, will per
mit President McKinley to mine a second
commissary-general, probably in the per
son of Colonel Cushins;.
Of the naval vacancies, the principal
ones will be caused by the retirement of
Admirals Waiker, Ramsay and Brown,
and Commodores Pythian and Wallace.
There is little room for speculation here,
s'nee in the navy promotion goes by
seniority. It is rumored that Admiral
itamsay may retire before the end of this
administr ntion, like General Craighill, in
order that President Cleveland mny make
the appointment of the new chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, and in that event
the name of Captain Robley D. Evans is
uggested.
IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE.
Some of the Most Important Measures
That Will Engage the Attention of
Congress This Wzek.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 13.â The in
effectual effort of last week to sidetrack
the immigration bill indicates that that
measure wi'l be maintained as the tin
finis ed business until it iia- been put to
the fiiiai vote.
By unanimous consent. House bill pro
viding for free homesteads on the public
lands in Oklahoma Territory for actual
and bona-n'<le settlers and reserving the
public lands for that purpose has been
made the special order to follow the immi
gration bill. The homestead bill is likely
to arouse some antagonism, but it U be
iieve.i that it will come to a vote without
unusual delay.
Beyond these two subjects there is noth
ing on the calendar having the right of
way. Morrili's resolution prohibiting the
nse of the Congressional Horary for the
purpose of the inaugural ball is likely to
ba reported from the committee and called
up. The friends of the resolution claim
that it will readily pass when it has been
reponed. Cuban affairs are also likely to
come to the front at any moment.
In the House to-morrow is District of
Columbia day under the calendar. The
bill defending the rights of the purchas
ers of the franchise and property of the
Atlantic and Pacific Railway Company,
sold under foreclosure of the mortgage
authorized by the act of 1871, will come
up on Tuesday.
It is wituin the power of the House
under the conditions now prevailing to
as much time as may be desirea to
the consideration of this measure.
The military appropriation bill is ex
pected to he on the calendar in time for
discussion Wednesday, and the legislative
and judicial bill by Thursday.
It is among the probabilities that ad
journment for the holiday recess will be
taken on Friday. The subject was dis
cussed by Rei'iiulican members of the
Committee on Ways and Means Saturday,
and no conclusion was reached. The re
cess, whenever it begins, ia expected to
extend until Monday or Tuesday after
New Year's.
Death of a Great Racer.
ST. LOUIS, Mo, Dec. 13.â Freeland, the
greatest thoroughbred horse on the Amer
ican turf, died yesterday of old age on
George Wright's stock farm near this city.
He was a son of Longfellow and Belle
Kni.ht, and was foaled at the Nantula
farm in Kentucky in 1879. His Kreatest
performance was in 1885. when he beat
Miss Woodford for a $20,000 stake. Of late
years he has been the property of A. H.
Snink, who starred the horse in his play,
"The Derby Winner."
fterer Counterfeit Coin*.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 13.â Some clever
counterfeiter is flooding the circulating
medium of St. Louis with an exceedingly
well executed counterfeit of United Stntes
$5 gold coins. The dies are almost perfect
and the only rough work about the coun
terleit coin is in the milling, the edges
being irregular and thicker than on the
genuine. The metal, however, is sofr,
wears easily and the center clearly indi
cates plating. With all these defects,
howerer, the counterfeit is a dangerous
one and caculated to deceive the unwary.

Central Railroad.
NEW YORK, N. Y.,Dec. 13.-J. Pierpont
Morgan, it is said in a report puDlished
to-day, represents a majority of the stock
of the New York Central and Hudson
River Railroad Company, and will soon
crowd out the Vanderbilt interest in the
management. C. M. Depew was described
as intending to resign the presidency of
the road and to go as Embassador to Eng
land under Mr. McKinley's administra
tion. Mr. Depew said to a reporter of tbe
New York Times to-day:
"The Vanderbilts have not had a con
trolling interest in New York Central stocK
since IHBO, when William H. Vanderbilt
sold $30,000,000 in stock to English buyers
represented by the Morgan house. W. H.
Vanderbilt thought that the ownership of
a majority of the shares of the company
by one person or family would be to the
detriment of the property.
"Though the public used and profited by
the railroad, it would be more likely to
complain ol one than of many owners. It
was deemed advisable to diffuse the own
ership among many persons, and there are
now 13.000 stockholders, persons of every
condition of life, of course, and the usual
number of widows and orphans. Mr.
Morgan's relations with the Vanderbilts
and with the company are up to this min
ute precisely what they have been for a
long time, and the cordial co-operation
will continue to exist. Since the sale of
$30,000,000 to English investors the capital
stock of ihe company has been increased
from $89,000,000 to $100,000,000. The Eng
lish have not increased proportionately."
Mr. Depew said that the Vanderbilts
were necessary to the New YorK Central
and it could be seen why to the interest of
all the stockholders the Vanderbilts
should remain in control. They con
trolled the lines east and west that end in
Montreal. If those railroads were divert
ed to the Erie or the LacKawanna, Mr.
Depew said, it would be greatly to the in
jury of the Central railroad. Mr. Depew
repeated that the relations of the Vander
bilts to the company will be maintained.
As for the embassadorsbip to England
or Secretary of State, or any other posi
tion in the administration, Mr. Depew
said he bad not been offered any one and
consequently it was no use for him to say
what he would do.
THIS IS AN UNUSUAL SUIT.
An Action Commenced in Kentucky to
Recover Property Belonging to the
Estate of a British Subject.
HENDERSON, Ky., Deo. 13.â An un
usual suit which wili be watched with in
terest ail over the United States was filed
here yesterday, it being stated that tbe
point involved is raised for the first time.
The State seeks, under the alien law, to
reclaim property valued at $30,000 because
the owner afterward became a subject of
Great Britian, the contention being that
he thereby forfeited the right to own prop
erty in the United S;ates.
Mrs. Mary Newcombe and others are
made defendants. There are complica
tions because Mrs. Newcombe is the second
wife, but this does not affect the particu
lar point at issue. B. F. Newcombe, now
deceased, owned various pieces of prop
erty in and about Henderson, At the
breaking out of the Civil War he fled to
Canada where he later took an oath of
allegiance to the Queen of Great Britian
and never returned to this country. He
became a British subject thirty-three
years ago. A contest of the will by a son
of Newcombe by his first wife is now
pending in the higher courts.
DELAY ED BY THE GALES.
Hough Voyage of the St. Louin and Lxi-
ciinin slero** the Atlantic.
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 13.â The
American liner St. Louis and tne Cunarder
Lucania, two of the fastest merchant ves
sels afloat, tied up at their docks this
this morning after the longest trip, in
point of time, in their history. Neither
met with an accident of any sort, the
delay being caused by gales and squalls
which they encountered from the time
they got well to sea until tbe last thirty
hours of their trip.
The Lucania traveled a course of 2776
knots in 7 days 10 minutes. She was
beaten at Fire Island by the St. Louis by
over six hours. The latter boat covered
the trip of 3054 knots in 7 days 13 hours
and 32 minutes.
The smallest day's run of the Lucania
was 268 knots, while the elements could
not confine the American liner to less
than 317 knots for a single day's run.
UNION PACIFIC COLLATERALS.
I'lan of Agreement }or Their Proposed
R'orgnnizntion,
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 13.â The plan
and agreement for the reorganization of
t c Union Pacific 6 per cent collateral
note trust will be published to-morrow by
distribution of copies at t lie Mercantile
Trust Company's in New York and the
American Loan and Trust Company's in
Boston. The plan proposes the organiza
tion of a new company for the purpose of
acquiring under foreclosure the collaterals
held in the Union Pacific note trust of Sep
tember 4, 1891, and allots to depositors of
notes par in 5 per cent bonds and 50 per
cent in the stock of the new company. The
committee consists of John G. Moore and
James W. Alexander of New York and Ed
win F. Atkins of Boston. The considera
tion requiring this organization are out
lined as follows by a member of the com
mittee:
"It is the purpose to reorganize the
truÂ«t certificates in harmony with the re
organization of the Union Pacific Rail
way. The character of the securities is
such that this method of reorganization
is required to best preserve and enhance
their value. They largely represent en
terprises promoted by the Union Pacific
Railway Company, or so reluted to it that
the best results to both interests can only
be obtained by such a harmonious reor
ganization. The holders of notes are
called upon to accept a 5 per cent obliga
tion in lien of an overdue 6 per cent obli
gation secured upon the same collateral.
The difference in the interest rate, and the
possibility of increased value resulting
from holding the securities together and
-id ministering them as proposed by the
committee, are represented by the stock
of the new company to be issued to the
assenting note-holders in the proportion
fixed by the plan."

AFTER THE GREAT
SIX-DAY RACE
The Wheelmen Recovering
From the Effects of
the Strain.
Rice Is Now Anxious to Enter
Into a Contest With Hile,
the Champion.
The Wilkesbarre Boy Says Ho Is
Confident of Covering Two
Thousani Miles.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 13. -Teddy
Hale, although somewha; stiff and sore
to-day, did not seem much the worse for
winning the championship of the world
hi the six-day bicycle race. When he
spoke, however, it was apparent that the
cigar smoke in the garden had done its
work. As soon as he could get away from
the scene of the race Saturday night Bale
was taken to a bathing establishment,
where he was massaged and allowed to
sleep fourteen hours at^ intervals, the
longest period being five hours. During
the race he had only eight hours' sleep.
His appetite was enormous every day, as
was also that of Rice, who complained
that his trainers were "trying to starve
him."
Hale's managers' calculations show that
the winner traveled just thirty-five miles
more than the official score of 1910 miles
and 8 laps and that by ieaving the track
for the short rest be lost about sixty-six
miles. On this figuring Hale wouid very
likely have established a record of over
2000 miles had he adopted diff rent tactics.
Starting to-morrow Hale will begin an
engagement at one of the local variety
theaters. The other members of the for
eign party will go either to Baltimore or
Washington and then on a tour of the
cities. The proposed Australian tour has
been abandoned owing to the success of
Hale.
Rice, the Wilkesbarre machinist, who
finished second to Hale, was as strong as a
lion to-day and in condition, he said, to
ride a fifty-mile race in fast time. He re
turned to the Putnam House early in the
morning after a visit to tbe Turkish bath,
during which he slept for four and one
half hours at intervals. His appetite was
something remarkable. He suffered very
little during the race physically, and lost
only one pound during the week. His
mind wandered a bit toward the close of
the race, but be is all right now.
The lack of attention Monday and Tues
day destroyed Rice's chances lor first
prize Practically he might as well have
had no attention at all. On Wednesday
when he was in such bad condition
Michael Breslin went to his assistance and
brought him around and kept him in con
dition until the arrival of Harry Campbell
from Wilkesbarre.
Campbell said to-day that Rice had
trained very little for the race. "In fact,"
said he, "all the training he did was to
work on his bicycle until 11 o'clock every
night during the week before the race.
He built tbe machine he rode."
This was Rice* first long race, although
in 1892 he started in one but was forced to
quit. He knows now, that with the ex
perience gained in this race, he can cover
2000 miles within six days. He says he
wouid like to race against Hale again and
could get plenty of backing if the Irish
man wishes a race. The Wilkesbarre man
will leave for home Wednesday. Forster
suffered more than any of the others.
His face showed the strain under which
he had labored. Taylor, tbe colored boy,
was none the worse for the ride.
The prize-winners and the four men
who failed to land within the first eleven
will receive their rewards to-morrow at
noon in the Hotel Bartholdi.

737 Market Street, Sau Francisoo, Cal.DINGLEY TO GET
A CABINET PLACE
Now Certain That He Will
Receive the Treasury
Portfolio.
During This Session of Congress
the Maine Statesman Will
Revise the Tariff.
Then the Bill Bearing His Name Will
Bs Enacted by Him as Treas
ury Secretary.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 13.âRepre
sentative Dingley of Maine will be the next
Secretary of the Treasury. This is settled as
definitely a3 any position in President
elect McKinley's Cabinet can be settled
nearly three months before the official an
nouncement is made. Mr. Dingley knows
that he is Mr. McKinley's choicÂ» for the
treasury portfolio, and he has even con
ceded to one or two intimate friends that
after the 4th of next March he will not
represent Congress in his old district.
Next to Mr. McKinley Mr. Dingley is the
ablest student of the tariff in American
Ai'Oiitics. The new tariff bill will be framed
â ny him as the chairman of the Ways and
'Means Committee of the present Congress,
and administered by him as Secretary of
the Treasury.
There is a rumor current to-night that
Mr. Dingley will endeavor to frame the
new tariff bill in time to pass it tbrough
the present House.
Certain it is that it is the intention of
the Republican members of the Ways and
Means Committee to push the work of
preparing the measure with the utmost
dispatch. The time which will be de
voted to hearings of manufacturers and
workingmen will be limited and will cer
tainly not extend beyond the middle of
January. Every member of the present
Ways and Means Committee has been in
Congress for years, and has attended these
hearings so often that they are perTectly
familiar with the details. If possible, the
bill will be drawn up, it is said, in time to
report it to the House in February, and to
pass it at this session, after reasonable
debate.
Mr.Reed.it is understood, is in accord
with Mr. Dingley's hope. It is known
that the Speaker is not anxious for an
extra session and would leave noihing
undone to prevent one. If the bill passes
the House and dies in the Senate, then
upon that body will rest the responsibility
of an extra session.
The friends of Mr. Dingley will earnestly
support him if he determines to under
take the passage of a tariff bill at this ses
sion. Mr. Dingley will frame the bill,
â¢and it wiil be the "Dingley" tariff bill.
It would be manifestly unjust, they say,
if, after Mr. Dingley has had all the labor
of its preparation, the bill should be
known by some other man's name. The
Dingley b.ll, they assert, will ba the tariff
Jaw for tbo uezt quarter of a century, and
they are anxious that it shall stand on
the statute-books as a monument to Mr.
Dingley's industry and ability. By pass
i^inp; the bill at this session it will be known
7 always as the Dingley bill, even if neglect
of the Senate to act upon it would compel
Mr. Dingley's successor as chairman of
the \V;iys and Means Committee in the
Fifty-fifth Congress, who will probably be
Mr. Dalzeli, to reintroduce the measure
when Congress meets in extra session.
It is reported that Speaker llped will
Jend every aid to Mr. Dingiey's ambition.
Within the past few days several mem
bers who asked him privately if their |
presence was needed at the session, w. en I
only routine business was contemplated,
were told in positive terms that the
Speaker expecied every man to be present,
as be might be needed.
BASS A. MAY I.1 '. H.T ACCEPT.
And Jieie â¢ Torhers Likely to Get Two
I'lace* in the Cabinet.
CANTON,. Dec. 13.â After a week
of great activity Major McKinley enjoyed
a restful morning. He walked to church
in the morning, and later called at his
mother'?, where he remained to dine. ;
There ' will be a number of visitors of
wide reputation this week and among
them will be Mr. Hanna. It is believed
that he has made up his mind to go into
the Cabinet if a place is offered him. as it
doubtless will be. There is no probability,
however, that the two most important
places in the Cabinet, the pivotal places,
as it were, that of Secretary of State and
Secretary of the Treasury,. will be filled
by the middle of January. Major McKin
ley is giving the problems which confront
him due consideration and he will not per
mit himself to be hurried.
The Ne-v York situation is the most
complicated one, and it may be solvad by
the selection of two Cabinet officers from
that State â one a man to whom Platt i^
friendly ar.d one particularly acceptable
to the original McKinlty men. C. N.
Bliss, Andrew D. White, Horace Porter,
Stewart L. Woodford and J. S. Fassett are
the names most frequently heard here
when the New York situation is under
consideration. One thing, is certain, and
that is that no one in New* York State has
yet been offered a Cabinet portfolio. Can
didates for other than Cabinet places are
beginning to manifest themselves in Can
ton. William M. Hahn of Onio is an
active candidate for the important posi
tion of Commissioner of Pensions.
Visitors to Canton who have talked with
Major McKinley about tariff legislation
indicate that he is not in favor of an ex
treme measure of any sort, and that he
impressed upon those Congressmen with
whom he discussed the matter the idea
that no bill will do that shall not be so
fair, so thorough and so adequate that with
a little revision from time to tiras it wili
stand for ten or twelve years and give the
country an era of prosperity and freedom
from tariff agitations.

INDIANAPOLIS. Ixd., Dec. 13.â The
executive committee of the Monetary Con
ference is sending out letters to boards of
trade and commercial 1 oiies in the coun
Â«try to impress upon these orcanizations
the importance of selecting tne best possi-
Ye men to represent them in tne coming
convention.
The letter declares that no mistake
shouid be made in this direction ; that if
the convention is composed of able men
its work may do immeasurable good, but
if riot so composed it will thwart the ob
ject of i he meeting and result disastrously
io the recovery or prosperity and obstruct
future efforts of business men to promote
legislation.
A meeting of local business men was
held, and each will urge commercial inter

ST. LOUIS. Mo.. Dec. 13.â The Woman's
Bryan Club ot this city met yesterday and
reorganized as the Women's Political
Lvalue, the change in name being at the
request of Mrs. Bryan. A letter â¢from her
was read. Following is an extract from it :
"In behalf of Mr. Bryan and myself I
wish to thank you most heartily for the
greeting sent us by your organization. We
have not felt dismayed nor dish-artened
by defeat, for, with an adverse Congress,
the cause is much better without a Presi
dent than witn one. I think there will be
a movement put on foot for a permanent
organization of the women's silver clubs
throughout the country, in which move
ment I have no douut you are taking a
deep interest. It seems to me the right
thing to do, as we can then keep con
stantly informed as to the laws made by
the administration during the next four
years and also will be able to note the
growth, and strength ot the trusts and
corporations of our country and tlius keep
he people alive to the^ dangers that
hreaten our institutions."

met each other since the election. Sena
tor Teller stated that if he had been here
he should have declined to go into the
ltepublican caucus this week, as did his
silver colleagues who left the St. Louis
convention. What policy he should pur
sue in tne future he declined to say. So
far as the tariff was concerned Mr. Teiler
said he had his own views and would vote,
when ihe time came, as he thought beat

following reply to questions addressed to
him by a citizen of Marion touchine his
position on the silver question:
"Of course the ultimate question is
whether silver shall be money of final re*

is to be an inferior money redeemable in

Ireland's Executive Taxes.
CORK, Ireland, Dec. 13â A meeting
was held here to-day to protest against
the excessive taxation imposed on Ireland
by the British Government as compared
with the taxation in England, Scotland
and Wales. Lord Castleton of Upper
Ossory made a speech, in which he de
nounced the obstinacy of the British
Treasury in refusing to right the grievance
of the Irish in respect to the matter of
taxation. He added that he houed hi<=
tory might not repeat itself and that peo
ple of Cork follow the example set by Bos
ton in 1773, when indignant residents of
that place threw a quantity o. tea into the
harbor as a protest against the tax of 3
pence per pound imposed on that article
by the British Parliament. This utter
ance called forth cheers from the audi

ST. JOHNS, N. F., Dec. 13.â An
audac'ous smuggling conspiracy has been
discovered through the recent seizures of
contraband tobacco at Fortune Bay. The
tobacco was brought from the United
Stutes packed in special boxes, two of
which were intended to be concealed in
lobster cases and exported to England,
wnere the duties on tobacco are vory
heavy. Imnien>e quantities of canned
lobsters are exported from Newfound
land to England yearly, which has en
abled this practice to be pursued with
slight risk of detection.

OFFICERS RAID A
STOCKTON MINT
Coiners of Bogus Money
Caught After a Long
Search.
Made and Passed Large Num
bers of Spurious Quarters
and Nickels.
An Aged Coup c and Their Son Who
Led Agent Harris a Lively
Chase.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 13.â One of the
most important captures of counterfeiters
in recent years was effected in this city
last nieht, when Police Captain Simpson
ana Officer Mike Carroll arrested W. A.
Karns in a lodging-house here. The cap
ture breaks up a gang of counterfeiters
which has had headquarters in San Fran
cisco and Sacramento ana which recently
came to Stockton to work off a supply of
spurious coin. For some time Secret
Service Agent Harris has been on the trail
of three counterfeiters â an elderly man, a
woman and a youth â who have been dis
posing of quantities of counterfeit quar
ters and nickels. So cleverly have the
three evaded capture that Harris' work
would probably have proved futile had it
not been for the'r own carelessness, the
vigilance of Sheriff Cunningdnm and the
prompt action of Chief Kincsoury aud his
officers.
Karns, his son Bauny and the woman
have been operating on tbis coast for
many month?. Their counterfeit quarters
and nickels have been so well made that
it has been comparatively easy for them
to pass the coins turned out from their
molds. It became known to Harris that
bogus coins were being circulated in con
siderable quantities. He found that the
trio had headquarters on Market street in
San Francisco and in Sacramento, but be
fore lie could get certain evidence against
them they disappeared.
Several days ago the landlady of the
lodoing-house in which the counterfeiters
j lodged when they arrived in this city
came to Sheriff Cunningham with some
quarters and nickels which she had swept
up from beneath the beds of her lodgers.
They were unquestionably counterfeits,
for they were not finished, the edges not
having the facsimile of the mill work on
them completed. Cunningham at once
knew that a gang of counterfeiters was at
work here and he telegraphed to Secret
Service Agent Harris to come to Stockton
immediately. The Government official
was not tardy in coming and secured a
room next to that occupied by Karns and
i his son.
During the night he heard the chink of
the coins they were turning out, but he
did not dare to break in upon them and
seize the outfit, as in a recent case the
court decided that he made an illegal seiz
ure by not havins.' a search warrant issued
by the proper United States authorities.
The next morning such a warrant was is
sued by United States Court Commis
sioner Webster, but before an arrest could
be made Karns and his son disappeared.
A watch was kept upon their rooms, but
they did not return.
Harris went back to San Francisco,
leaving the affair in the hands of the au
thorities here. The room was watcheu,
and last night W. A. Karns returned. He
was at once arrested oy Captain Simpson
and Officer Carroll and the entire outfit in
his room seized. At first he seemed much
surprised, but finally took his arrett i
philosophically and told the officers
where he had been. He said he had been
at Oakclale, and that he walked from that
place to Stockton yesterday, a distance of
over thirty miles. Constable Crow at
Oakdaie was instructed to look for young
Karns, and this morning a telegram came
notilying the Sheriff of his arrest.
Harris was notified by wire last nieht of
the arrest of the elder Karns and arrived
to-day. He was anxious to have the news
of the cauture of the lather and son sup
pressed in order to capture the woman,
who is supposed to have cone to Sacra
mento.
The elder Karns is fully 65 years old.
There is little doubt that he will plead
guilty to the charge of counterfeiting. In
his trunk were found spoons and metals
for making the .spurious coins, but the
dies and molds were not captured. Harris
believes that the woman not only assisted
in passing the bogus money, but that she
helped in making it. While here Karns
and his son went under the name of Pres
ton.
When Karns was arrested he endeav
ored on a pretext to get out ot the room
in which the officers were. At this juncture
Sheriff Canninguam came in and asked if
the man had been searched. Simpson and
Carroll started to search him. Karns
took a handful of nickels from his pocket
and tried to hide them in the bed beside
which he was standing. The officers de
tected him and >ecured a quantity of the
oogus 5-cent pieces, which will be used as
evidence against him.
BURGLARS LOOT A PAWNSHOP.
Carry Away Everything of Value That
They Found Stored in the
Place.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 13.â One of the
boiuest robberies that have taken place in
years was committed at an early hour this
morning when the pawnbroker's shoo of
11. Jacobs was entered and ransacked by
two burglars. The men effected an en
trance through a trapdoor in the sidewalk,
and after they were once in the basement
they had no difficulty in gaining an en
trance to the store. They had a brace and
bit v,-ith them, and by borinir through the
wooden partition above the entrance from
the basement soon forced out a piece suffi
ciently large to enable them to enter the
store.
After getting into the pawnDroker's
shop, which is just across the plaza from
the courthouse In which the police sta
tion is located, the men had everything
their own way. They seem to have haa
no fear of detection, for they took off
every bit of their clothing and dressed
themselves from head to foot in garments
found about the store.
Their old clothes were left on the floor,
together with their hats and shoes, and
from these the officers hope to be able to
overhaul the thieves.
After thus clothing themselves the
burgiars took all the watches, jewelry,
trinkets, revolvers and ihe best clothing
in the place, and with these packed in
valises made good their escape.
Nothing was known of the robbery until
Jacobs opened his shop this morning. He
found that the p ace had been stripped of
everything of value. Not a single articie
that was worth anything had been left.
On the floor was the clothing of the
thieves, with the tools they used in break
iug into the place, llie clothing mdi

FIGHT FOR LIFE
WITH AN EAGLE.
Great Bird Attacks a Boy
on a San Marcos
Ranch.
The Lad Goes to ihe Defense oi
His Dog and Is Fiercely
Succeeds in Killing the Feathered
Invader After an Exciting
Combat.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 13 âTne Sledge
ranch, near San Marcos, is in a pretty
country not far from the impenetrable
crags of Palomar Mountain. Great cray
and bald eagles make their eyries on the
mountain, where they are safe from hunt
ers, and where a view stretches from Rin
con Indian reservation past Horsethief and
Hellhole canyons clear down through the
San Luis Rey and Escondido valleys to
the ocean. The great eagles on summer
days can be seen â specks in the sky â
taking a cruise out for stray sheep. On
the Sledge ranch there are many sheep
and their owner has been much troubled
by the depredations of eagles and coyotes.
Several days ago Henry Sledge, aged
16, was going through the fields with bis
dog when he saw a commotion a half
mile distant. T/he sheep were scattering
In all directions and there was a flapping
of wings and a general hubbub. Young
Sledge ran toward the spot as fast as he
could and h!s dog ran faster. A great
gray eagle had captured a fat young ewe
and was tearing her to pieces. He had
flicked her eyes out at one stroke of nis
claws and was using his beak and claws
with murderous effect.
The dog, a collie, attacked the eagle.
Young Sledge saw the fight. The eagle
paid no attention totne dog until attacked,
when it turned from the dying ewe and
returned the attack. For a moment there
was a mixture of fur and feathers, while
yelps, howls and growls mingled with the
Bcreams of the great bird,whose scruff was
raised, wings half open and claws and
beak in active operation. The eagle tried
to get at the dog's eyes, but the collie, by
instinct, avoided a thrust that would
blind it. The dog reached for the bird's
neck, but the eagle kept him off.
They rolled and tumbled, with the eagle
generally on top while the boy looked
around for a club with which to join the
fight. He finally got one and ran toward
the combatants. He was just in timp.
The eagle had secured a powerful grip
upon the dog and was attempting to rise
from the ground when the boy reached
the 6pot. The dog, bleeding and half
flayed, was yelping and ready to quit.
Young Sledge struck a hard blow on the
bird's wing, which caused it to drop.
Then, with its yellow eyes blazing, it
turned upon the boy.
Sledge was scared, but held his ground
because he could do nothing else. He
backed off and struck repeatedly at the
great bird, which took the offensive and
hovered over the lad.
Sledge used bis club with good effect,
striking the eagle over the wines and upon
the beak, which was invariably extended
with the rapidity of lightning toward the
descending weapon. The great claws
were dangerously near the boy's face,
when a iuckly blow upon the head stag
gered the f agle and it fell to the ground.
Sledge gave it no chance to recover, but
rained down blows upon its head and tin
ally dispatched it.
The dos was found to be suffering and
apparently dying and it was shot. Tne
boy took the eagle home and measured it.
Its great wings extended seven feet irom
tip to tip.
PLANS OF SOLA NO HUNTERS.
Will Shoot on Navigable Waters Within
tho Cordelia Club's Leased
Domain.
BENICIA, Cal.. Dec. 13.â The injunc
tion granted by Judge Buckles, restrain
ing hunters who are not members of the
Cordelia Club from shooting on the Suisun
marshes, while in line with the decision
of the Supreme Court, has created .a hostile
spirit among the sporting fraternity. Per
haps the views of Vie Harrier express the
sentiment of all interested. In an inter-
View to-day he said:
"We all recognize the fact that the in
junction, under the decision of the Su
preme Court, iB legally binding ; still the
marshes are traversed by navigable
streams in every direction, and on those
streams no injunction holds. The various
clubs have leases for over 22,000 acres,
which practically covers all the territory,
but the leases do not carry with them con
trol over the waters that may be naviga
ble, and we are going to shoot as much as
we wish, taking chances on what happens.
â¢'Of course we have the right of a new
trial, which we have every reason to be
lieve would result favorably to us, but we
would expect to have it appealed even if
we won. There is one thing in our favor,
and that is the public is with us and is
opposed to the clubs monopolizing these
shooting grounds. Any law that has not
received the support of public opinion
sooner or later becomes a dead letter."
Regarding the Supervisors, Mr. Harrier
said : "We will not ask them to take any
action in the matter, because there are go
in* to be some changes on the board.
New members are coming in ana old ones
retiring; consequently any action by them
might be the cause of complicating
matters."
B. Develin, the Senior Democratic
Supervisor, when askea wbat the actions
of the Supervisors would be said that
while the matter had Dcen discussed some
before the hunting season opened, lately
they had not done anything, and he did
not believe they would take any action.

Four Fishing Sloops Wrecked in Sight of
Spectators on the

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Dec. 13. â The
heaviest sea known here for years was
witnessed by a large crowd upon the
wharves this afternoon. Fears were ex
pressed for the fishing sloops out in the
bay, especially round the northern point,
and they were not groundless. The strong
southeasterly eale was the cause of wreck
ing four sloops in close proximity to the
wharf and in full view of the crowds
A gallant rescue was effected by Manuel
Lopez and Jose Amaya, who went on a
stoop out into the teeth of the gaie and
re&ciud the occupants of a wrecked boat.
No casualties are reported, but fear is felc
as to the safety of many of the boats now
out. The, swell sli-htly abated as dark

burning on the wharf it is hoped the
worst is over. It is not uncommon for
sixty b oats to be out in the buy at this
time, as the salmon are being caught in

Wants t'.imtiivr'i Seat,
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 13.-Among
the papers that will b; laid before the
House to-morrow will be the documents
in the matter of the contest by Alexis
Benert for the seat from the Fifth Louisi
ana District for the present term of the
Fifty-fourth Congress, for which C. J.
Boatner holds a certificate as the result of
a special election heid November 3 last.
Boatner and Eenert were opponents at
the election of 1894, and Boatner at that
time received a certificate oi the full term,
but he was unseated last spring as the re
su.t of a contest by Benert. The House,
however, refused to give the contestant
the seat for the reason that while
Boatner' 8 election was inval d, Benert
did not receive a sufficient number of
votes to warrant the House in declaring
him elected. So they tried it over again
last month and now Benert asks the
House to review the election. The con
test wiil go to the Committee on Elections,
of which Johnson (R.) of Indiana is
chairman.

EARP'S MANY COLORS.
Two Accounts of His Career In the
Examiner and Journal.
Wyatt Earp, the gun-fighting bodyguard
of Long Green Lawrence, managing editor
of the Examiner,, has as many colors as
Jacob's coat, if the accounts of him that
have been published in Mr. Hearst's two
papers are to be believed.
/ About the time that he was engaged as
gun-fighter-in-chief of the San Francisco
Monarch of tho Fakers a series of articles
appeared in that sheet exploiting his
career.
He was held up as the hero of many
stage robberies who had defended pas
sengers and mails at the risk of his
life. No praise was too great for his cour
age and honesty.
Here is what Alfred H. Lewis, who
knew the "bad man" in Arizona, has to
say in the New York Journal, Mr. Hearst's
other paper, which is not dominated by
Long Green, of Earp, in connection with
stage robberies:
In the early eighties there were two factions
in Tombstone. Virgil and Wyatt Earp led
oneâ the Stage Roobers. Johnny Behan, Ike
Clatuon and JacK Ringo led the otherâ the
Rustlers. The Stage Robbsrs were In politics
Republican, and stood up stages and plun
dered express companies for a livelihood. The
Rustlers were Democrats, and devoted them
selves to cattle-stealing, murder, whisky and
faro bank as steady pursuits. In these days
Jonnny Behan was Sheriff of Cochise County
and Virgil Earp was the Marshal of Tombstone.
Behan, as stated, belonged to the Cow-thief
Democracy party, while Earp robbed stages
and voted with the Republicans.
The Earps, Wyatt, Virgil, Warren and
Julian, had treated themselves to many a
killing. But there was no money in murder;
nothing but relaxation. So thjy devoted
themselves to holding up tlie stage. Virgil
Earp had a combination with Barshel Wil
liams, then the Wells-Fargo agent at Tomb
stone. When big money went out on the stage
Williams, tipped it off to Virgil- Earp. The
hold-ups were then planted in a convenient
canyon. When the stage came along, at the
words "Hands up!" Warreu Earp, who was a
stage-company guard, meekly put biÂ« hands
over his head. Then the hold-ups went
through the express pouches and boxes like
the grace of heaven through a camp-meeting.
There was never any shooting; it was from
all standpoints a family affair on the part of
the Earps. Often they got as high as $25,000.
After a roDbery the Earps â¢ made further
money, enlisting themselves v ? ith a posse
comltatus and chasing themselves. Virgil, as
marshal, would enlist Wyatt, Warren and
Julian, together with Curly Bill, their cousin,
and hum the hold-ups. It was a great indus
try, and by thus playing both ends a?ainstthe
middle, first robbing the stage and then pro
ceeding to chase the robbers, Virgil, Wyatt
Warren and Julian Earp waxed opulent.
An auditor in a Japanese theater is
allowed, for a; small fee,. to stand up, and !
the unfortunate individual behind v him
has no right to remonstrate or to rise and
get a peep at the stage. He may hear, i
but he cannot see. t " ' ' .<â¢'

WHERE RIVERSIDE
LEADS ALL CITIES
Has the Lowest Tax Rate
of Any Municipality
in California.
Grows and Prospers in the Cen
ter of a Horticultural
District.
Fifty-Two Square Miles of Garden
Land Embraced Within Its
Boundaries.
RIVERSIDE, Cal., Dec. 12.â The city
of Riverside, the judicial seat of the
county of the same name, is the com
mercial, social and industrial center of
one of the wealthiest sections of country
in Southern California. The city is situ
ated in the northwestern part of the
county, occupying a salubrious location
upon the elevated mesa rising from the
left bank of the Santa Ana River. It is
forty-five miles from the ocean, sixty
miles east of Los Angeles and 100 miles
north of Snn Diego. The first settlement
here was in 1871. The developments made
by the early arrivals, demonstrating tbe
wonderful resources and advantages of the
locality, soon attracted other home-seek
ers and by the year 1883 tbe town had
acquired a population or more than 2500
and was at that time incorporated as a
city. The valuation of property was then
$1,000,000.
la June, 1893, it became the county seat
of the newly formed county of Riverside.
The city now has over tnree times the
population which it had when incor
porated (8000), while its valuation has in
creased six-fold and amounts to $5,958,247.
It has a tax rate of only 65 cents on the
$100, the lowest of any city in the State.
The population of the city being largely
composed of well-to-do horticulturists
and substantial business men engaged in
occupations, directly or indirectly, con
nected with or dependent upon that prof
itable industry is, socially, of an excep
tionally high order, as is evidenced by
their refined and beautiful homes, their
splendid educational system, and the wise
and economical administration of the
municipal government. The city main
tains a line free public library and reading
room. The library has more than 9000
volumes and is drawn upon monthly to
the extent of 5009 volumes.
Eastern people, accustomed to the com
pactly built, densely populated cities of
their section, will be eurprised, no doubt,
upon learning that the city limits of Riv
erside comprise fifty-two square miies, up
on which is a population of less than
10,000. The reason for this is simply that
outside of the main business portion the
city is made up of small horticultural
farms, for the most part brought under a
high state of cultivation and laid out with
a view to beauty as well as utility.
The much-mooted question of "breath
ing spots" which occupies the attention of
the residents of the over-uopulated cities
of the East will never vex the fortunate
citizens of Riverside. Each property
holder has his own breathing place in his
beautiful, flower-perfumed grounds; and
the rich acres studded with the never
fading verdure of the orange, the lemon
and the olive. Broad avenues Jead out
for miles in all directions, giving easy ac
cess tor driving or rapid transit transpor
tation systems to the suburban towns, and
magnificent : hade trees upon each side
veil the sometimes too ardent glances of
the sun.
The business center of Riverside com
prises some nine or ten large blocks, each
about three hundred feet square. The
building;] are mostly of the bast modern
style of architecture, built of brick and
stone, and are two and three and four
stories in height. Some very imposing
facades of pressed brick, carved granite
and Arizona sandstone have been erected,
and compare favorably with those of any
city of its class.
Indeed, the Handsome and substantial
character of both business and residence
structures is perfectly in keeping witn the
status of Riverside as the wealthiest city
per capita, in the United States. And dur
ing the last few years of the country's
business depression Riverside properties
have maintained a good substantial value.
There is no more certain index to tiie pros
perity and wealth of a community than
the steady maintenance of good real es
tate values. Boom figures may be asked
and obtained for a brief period, bat
values must find their permanent level
at thi! tide-mark of solid and tangible
progress and improvement. To this is
owing the fact that Riverside was but little
affected by the absurd boom epidemic
which convulsed Houtuern California a few
years ago. Legitimate progress in the di
rection of horticultural industry was well
tinder way at that time, and a3 sales were
quickly made to people who sensibly saw
mat tne surest way to competency was to
plant and improve their property, and not
venture the savinge of a iuetime in specu
lative methods, which must inevitably re
suit disastrously to the inexperienced who
failed to "unload" in time.
In th.s way Riverside County secured'a
large number of her best and most pros
perous and conservative citizens, who are
energetic in promoting all worthy plans
lor extending her commercial and indus
trial interests. The business enterprises
of Riverside are very satisfactory, in spite
of the universal Depression which has
made itself felt throughout the United
States for the past three and a half years.
Tne city is the commercial and banking
center of a wide area of rich country, and
the fact that our banks are of tne sound
est and most substantial character is evi
dence that there is a large amount of
money to handle.
Id but lew lines of trade is there an ap
pearance of overcrowding, but the growth
of the mercantile and manufacturing iii
terests keeps at about a just ratio to the
demand.
Riverside has just completed lighting
her streets with electricity, having more
than 100 arc lights and some thousands of
incandescents for commercial and do
mestic lighting. The city is also just
closing the last section of paving of more
than seven miles of her beautiful streets
and avenues, thus adding to the comfort
of the tourist and stranger as well as the
enjoyment of her own citizens.

BEFORE THE WAR.
How the Memory of Other Days Dwells
in the Southern Heart.
Southerners who lived in more luxury
before the war than they have been able
to do since have a very natural way of
dating everything by comparing every
event of the present time to those balmy
days "befo' the wa'." It i 3 quue unneces
sary to say that all things suffer by com
parison. It was the custom of the guests
at the sanitarium to assemble on the
porches just before sundown, to watch
the retiring process of old Sol as he
slipped away to bed behind Mount Pis
gah, one of the loftiest peaks of the Blue
Range.
Some of the guests were asserting they
could see the gray hairs on the back of
the "Rat," another elevation, so called
from its resemblance to that animal, A
lutle patch of fleecy clouds had evidently
cauidit fast on the pines in passing a
cliff, and some one said .Beancatcher Peak
was flirting with Beaumont, while the
Balsam Range, others said, had already
put on a nightcap of mist, with now and
then a oluejack peak projecting above the
clouds. Otherwise not a cloud was to be
seen, save a few mackerel scales just above
the western horizon.
Just as but half of the sun's orbit was
left in view, and shadows v.ere rapidly
deepening and the last departing shafts of
sunlieht were gilding the domes of the
most lofty hills, and every one was all but
speechless with admiration at the splen
dor of the sunset, one woman, a North
erner and a newcomer, was able to keep
her tongue going.
'â¢Oh, i was thinking," she was saying to
a Southern lady, "that was the most ex
quisite sunset I ever saw; tell me, is it a
custom down here for the sun to set like
that?"
â¢'Oh, that's nothing," was the reply,
"you should have seen it befo' tnewa'!"

NELSON'S FAMOUS SIGNAL.
"England Expects Every Man to Do
His Duty."
At the United Services Institute, White
hall, at which relics connected with Tra
falgar and Nelson are to be exhibited,
there is a time-stained document framed
and hung on the western wall from which
it appears that the famous signal, "Eng
land expects every man to do his duty,"
was not wholly Nelson's, says St. James'
Gazette. Lieutenant Pasco, who was re
sponsible for the signaling on the admir
al's ship, makes the following statement:
"His lordship came to me on the poop
and alter ordering certain signals to be
made about a quarter to noon said: '"Mr.
Pasco, I want to say to the fleet: "Eng
land confi'lea that every man will do
his duty."' He added: "You must be
quick, for I have one more to add.
which is for close action.' I replied: 'If
your lordship will permit me to substitute
the word '"expects" for "confides" the
signal will soon be completed, because the
word "expects" is in the vocabulary and
"confides" must be spelled.' His lord
ship replied in haste and in seeming satis
faction: 'That will do, I'asco; make it
directly.' As the last hoist was hauled
down Nelaon turned to Captain Black
wood, who was stanaing Dy him, with:
" 'JNow I can do no more. We must
trust to the creat Disposer of all events
and the justice of our cause. I thank God
lor this ereat opportunity of doing my
duty.' When Lord Nelson's message had
been answered by a few ships in the van
he ordered me to make signal for close
action and keep it up. Accordingly, I
hoisted No. 16 at the topgallant masthead,
and there it remained until shot away."
Such is the du!v sworn and attested state
ment of Nelson's flag lieutenant, which
he gave to Colonel Baylis, Q. C, who pre
sented it to the museum.
The Czar of Russia owns the largest
landed estate in the world. It is about

OF CALIFORNIA
A The month of December is the season of
1 social Jestivity and gayety in the National
" Guard. Accord'ng to tbe regulations
â¢drills are not compulsory this month, so
attention may be turned to dances, jinks
and minstrel shows in the armory. Spare
time can be devoted to discussion of mili
tary necessities, such as the allowance of
public money for overcoats, blankets and
clothing for all-around duty.
Colonel William Macdonald"s First In
fantry regiment has in its keeping the
, honor of the National Guard of California
so far as merit in marksmanship is con
cerned. Colonel Macdonald, Lieutenant- !
Colonel Duboce, the gallant majors and
the equally gallant captains of the First
insisted that the Hawaiian National j
Guard should be challenged to a trial of
sboeting skill. The challenge was ac- i
cepted, and so next month 100 men of i
each organization will shoot for a trophy. |
It is expected that the First Infantry ,
marksmen will win, but if by some un
luc&y chance, poor ammunition, high j
winds or undue excitement the Hawaiians !
should carry off the honor, the First â 
â¢ would be guyed unmercifully by the Sec
ond, Fifth and Sirth reeimenis. It is |
surely in order for the local marksmen j
to get down to practice work at the range. \
Captain Carrmgton, U. S. A., who is on j
duty as inspector of the State troops, has j
lorwarded to the Secretary of War the !
names of officers in the National Guard of j
California who are competent to command I
â¢ troops in the field, ibis supplemental
report is considered at the "\Vi-r Depart
ment as a confidential communication to
'. the Secretary, and is, therefore, withheld
from the public It is ascertained, how
.._ ever, that tne list embraces twelve or more
names.
Company G, First Infantry, has elected I
WÂ« N. Swasey second lieutenant to fill the
." vacancy caused by the resignation of Lieu
.Tenant Christy.
Everything appears to progress swim
', n'ingiy with the proposed new troop of
cavalry. Toe members are enthusiastic
and ail are energetic in their effons to .
make it a thorough cavalry organization,
- well disciplined and handled. Nearly all
I' thus far enrolled have been otfic rs and
non-coin missioned officers, and quite n
number oi them wear the badge of the
â¢ Veteran Corps, indicative of Beven years'
' service.
At the meeting held on Monday even
ing iast it was decided that sufficient
members were enrolled to prepare for per- â¢
nianent organization, and a committee,
consisting of Colonel Â±1. P. Bush, Captain
William L. SuUivan iÂ»nd Frank Triest,
were appointed to formulate a pian to â 
that effect. As it was decided to close the j
enrollment with seventy-five members, a j
suggestion was .made tuat the committee 1
â¢houid provide in its plan for an initia
tion fee 10 be charged to all joining after
the report is submitted.
Resolutions were adopted to meet each
Monday evening for the present and to
invite officers of the army to add ress the
members on military subjects.
The committee on permanent organiza
tion is expected to submit its report tuis
evening, and the first lecture of the course
will de delivered at the rooms in the
Flood building.
When the reports on the recent emer
gency call are all considered at headquar
ters it will be found that the Fifth 111
-lantry Regiment, Colonel Fairbanks', will
be entitled to a position near the head of
tbe column. Captain D. A. Smith, adju- j
tant of the Fifth displayed remarkaDle en
ergy in dispatching orders by telegraph,
but in the absence of reeimental funds he
was ooliged to pay from his o*n pocket
the expense of sending the messages over
tne wire. The various organizations of
the Fifth responded promptly.
Colonel Fairbanks still maintains regi
mental headquarters at Petaluma. There
ha 3 been some talk of establishing head
quarters in Snn Francisco.
WOODLAND, Cal., Dec. 11.â This being
a quiet month for the raili;ary there is but
little to write about -he doings of the citi
zen soldiers. 1 here is considerable work
bsing done in and out of the armory. The
stone walk is finished and adds very much
to the appearance of the armory. The
mnch-talked-of flagpole has been erected.
It is composed of turee sections of pipe.
The lower section is 4 inch, the middle
section is 3 inch and the upper section is
2 inch. It is imbedded in cement at the
bottom and attached 10 the building by an
iron shoulder. Ail that the company is
waiting for now is for some patriotic per
son to present a flag. The halls and one
or two of the rooms have been painted
â¢and sanded to the height of about six
feet. A football team has been organized j
in the company, and it would like to have
the other companies in the Stale do like
wise and then play a series o. games 10
see who is boss. Private Marden is the
coach and is doing good work with the
team, and expects soon to have first-class
players. The team will soon be ready to
meet any other football team of the N .G.
C. barring all profes-ionals.
Some tiino in February the company
will give a grand ball to celebrate the first
anniversary of the new armory.
NEWS OF THE ANGLESEY.
The Overdue Vessel Spoken Five Days
Ago by tbe French Ship I-eg
Atleiphes.
Yesterday was a good day for port ar
rivals and five deepwater vessels made
their way into the harbor. They were the
" French ship Les Adelphes, 75 days from
Newcastle, New South Wales; the British
ship Lanpdale 73 days and the British ship
Kerr TI days from the same place; the
British ship Centesima, 171 dÂ£y3 from
k Dundee, via Newcastle, England, 145 days,
and the British ship Osborne, 122 days
.from Swansea.
The Les Adelphes reports that four days
â¢ away from this port she spoke the British
ship Anglesey, now 100 days out from
Newcastle. Tbe vessel is so long overdue
that her charter has expired and 15 cents
reinsurance has been paid on her.
The vessel had been delayed by heavy
winds and stormy weather. Tim news
relieves her owners and consignees of an
anxiety that was increasing ev<-ry day.
The steamer Czarina, after her exfn
sive repairs, went to sea ye3terday, bound
for Coos Bay, practically a new vessel.
Captain Drisko speeded the vessel around
the bay before going outside as he wished
to verify his compasses. She was raptur
ously saluted by all the vessels in the
haroor as she steamed away. The bar was
too roush for her, however, and she re
turned in the afternoon.
The sloop Nellie returned yesterday
from a week's cruise along the duck pre
serves of Suisun Bay. She carried a party
consisting of Captain Dave Deane, E. P.
Peterson, James H. Daley, A. Houston
and Otto Hines. They renort innumer
able hairbreadth escapes from the perils
of sea and land, ana also that they bagged
a dozen ducks.
As the Centerime was entering the har
bor she struck on the north bank, causing
the vessel to spring a leak. The sea was
breaking heavily on the bar, and the
swell, rolling under the ship, let her down
hard on the bank. The lenk was slight
and she came to anchor off Green-street
wharf about 4 o'clock.

WORK AMONG
THE DESTITUTE
Report from the Society of
St. Vincent de Paul for
the Past Year.
Fifteen Hundred People Hive
Been Helped Out of Their
Troubles.
More Room and More Clothing Need-d
for the Poor at the A mshou.e
This Winter.
At the quarterly meeting of the Society
of St. Vincent de Paul, held yesterday
afternoon at the church of the Mission
Dolores, a splendid showinz was made of
charitable work done among the deserv
ing poor all over the City. Reports were
read from all the conferences except St.
Mary's, which by an oversight had been
made to cover only two months' work in
stead of that of the whole term. The re
port will be filed with the secretary of the
society in a few days.
The work is progressing very favorably,
and the society is planning a large exten
sion of its usefulness by securing the
co-operation of conferences from the
foreign Roman Catholic churches, which
have a large membership in San Fran
cisco. The number of German Catholics is
especially large and they have two
churches. There are also French, Spanish
and Italian churches. The Society of St.
Vincent de Paul desires that conferences
of these churches of foreign speech should
come into their society, and the question
of inviting them will be submitted to the
cor.sideration of the Archbishop.
After the secretary of the society, P. J.
Thomas, had read" the detailed reports
from tde several conferences, the presi
dent, J. M. Burnett, summed up the last
term's work, as follows:
Total receipts, $1309 07; total expenditures,
$17u9 30; balance in treasury, $2000; num
ber families relieved, 471: number of per
sons in- same, 1476; number or visits made
1051.
A report from the Almshouse commit
tee of the society was read, which states
that the inmates are well looked after and
generally contented. Donations were
made to them of reading matter, consist
ing of papers and prayer-books and of
tobacco to the men, all of which were
greatly appreciatad. There is a lack of
accommodation there, owing to the largely
increased number 01 inmates, which is
is now eighty-four more than were there
iast year, making a total of 897. There
are accommodations for 89G. but the pos
sibilities of a large increase in this num
ber during the cold winter months makes
the present provision inadequate. Mr.
Reddy, the superintendent of the Alms
house, suggested that the society's com
mittee assist him in obtaining an appro
priation from the Supervisors of $2500, to
be used in the purchase of fifty beds and
seventy-five blankets and the fitting up of
No. 2 building as a dormitory.
The committee further reDons that
clothing is needed for both men and
women and suggests thai an organized
effort be made by all conferences 10
gather clothing that could be used by
these poor old people, who reqniie warm
clothing during the cold winter months.
The society took action on this report
by passing a resolution that each con
ference should be urged to exert itself to
secure clothing for these unfortunate
people.
The Conference of St. Joseph was ap
pointed to visit the Almshouse during the
next term.
The next regular meeting of the society
will be held the first Sunday in Lent at
St. Joseph's.
Father J. J. Prendergast of St. Mary's
Cathedral, who is the spiritual director of
tiie society, delivered a short address, in
which he commended the various con
ferences for their energetic work among
the poor. He said this wort had been
most effective and that there had been no
carelessness and no indifference.
The meetine was closed with an earnest
prayer by Father Prendergaat.
The work of the various conferences in
detail is as follows:
Sacred Heartâ Total receipts, $70 10;bal
nnce last report, s6l 65; expenditures, $81 25;

During the p3rformance at the Co'urn

Davies, the actress, was badly bruised by
being in the play-elevator, weighing 400
pounds, when it slipped down further
than usual and rested heavily upon her.
Dr. Edwin Bunneil, who was in the audi
ence, at once came to her assistance and
attended her in her dressing-room. She
so far recovered after a fainting spell that
she appeared on tbe stage in tho next act,
inconvenienced only by a slight Jimp.
Another elevator accident resulting
more seriously occurred between 5 ana 6
o'clock at "The Maze." "Ed" MoKeever,
an employe, residing in Oakland, had
stepped down into the sidewalk basement
elevator from the street, intending to de
scend. He pulled the wrong rope and
both legs were crushed as the elevator
rose. He was removed to the 'Waldeck
Sanitarium, where his left leg was found
to be broken below the knee and his riÂ«ht
leg severely crushed. The leg was set by
Dr. Barbat.

LITTLE CHILDREN
WILL TEND TABLE
Brigadier Keppsl Prepar
ing to Feast Three
Thousand.
The Dinner Will Take Place in
0!d Armory Hall on
Christmas Day.
Members of the Salvation Army Busy
Seeking Contributions for
Their Fund.
A new and pretty feature ia to be Intro
dated at tbe dinner which will be given
by the members of the Salvation Army at
the old armory, corner of Howard and
New Montgomery streets, on Christmas
day. The child members of the army
will take a very prominent Dart by assum
ing and acting as little waiters and wait
resses.
Brigadier Keppel has displayed much
interest in the preparations which are be
ing made and wishes it understood that
the dinner is not to be considered in ths
light of a charity affair.
He says it is not their intention to treat
the people that gather at their tables as
though they were a band of hungry ani
mals.
The dinner will be given for the benefit
and happiness of the poor friendless men,
women and children who, were it not for
the never-failing kindness and generosity
of the Salvation Array, would spend a
dreary, cheerless Christmas.
The children have in store a surprise for
the army's cuests in the nature of a sim
ple entertainment of music and sonjj.
Dozens of letters are received daily at
the army headquarters begging assist.
ance, many of them containing a plea not
to be forgotten at Christmas time. And
not one of them will be forgotten if the
army has means to supply them all â but
it takes money to buy food and clothing,
and so far contributions have come in
very, very slowly.
About 3000 people are expected to dine
at the armory on Christmas ilay, and al
though the members of the Salvation
Army always investigate a case of charity
reported to them before they tender the
necessary assistance, at Christmas-time
there is never any distinction made. The
good and bad, worthy aud unworthy will
be seated side by side.
At the headquarters all will be bustle
and excitÂ«rnem from now until ihe2sth
inst., for donations will be pouring in
from all quarters, and the distribution of
them wul not be an easy task. If those
who take an interest in the army will send
any illustrated pa pern or colored pictures
that they happen to lnve on hand to the
army headquarters the members will be
very grateful. The union unates who live
at the Pest:i<Hise and the inmate* of the
Home for Imbeciles at Glen El'en are
supplied with pictures and papers by the
army.
League of the Cross Football.
During the past week preliminary arrange
ments were made for the annual League of the
Cross Cadets tootball game, to be held at Cen
tral Park on New Years day. The contest will
be betweeu elevens from Company Aof tne
Cathedral parish and Company B of St.
Charles.
Great interest is manifested in this game,
as there is a strong but friendly rivalry be
tween the two companies. The team from
Company A has played several games, of
which it won two and tied another. The

An extra session of Congress seems vir

ine a protective tariff bill for submission
to it is now under way, so that it behooves
the people of California to be active in
making representations at Washington
which will secure for our industries the
protection they need.
Notwithstanding the recent campaign
was waged mainly on tho money question
the people of this couutry were never so
indifferent in recent years to all sorts of
money reform as they are now. The only
thing they are discussing is the tariff. It
is evident they know what they need, and
are determined to have it.
The prediction that Wiliie Hearst may
yet go up the Hudson and change his
name to i\o. 741S is not regarded in New
York as a hope merely. It is remembered
that a fellow who ran a Hearaty news
paper in Chicago is now known by the
number of his cell, and what has hap
t>eneH there may happen in New York.
The New York Herald notes with pride
that at present "we have a glut of idle
money, rates of interest are lower here
than in Europe and the bankers and capi
talists of the Old World are borrowing
from us.'' It is questionable, however,
whether there is good cause for pride in
the situation. It would be better for us
to be using our money to build up the un
developed West than to be sending it
across the ocean.
WILD-HORSE JOURNALISM.
As a striking exampie of "Wild-horse Journalism" the Examiner is at present
making itself an immense success. In the nope of diverting the public mind from
indignant comment upon its recent indecencies it has been running of late a reckless
aDd riderless course, without apparent thought or care where its runaway will end
or what the consequences to the public or to the paper may be.
About a week ago, in a fit of extreme though not unusual folly, it repub
lished certain comments of a quite uncomplimentary character
which interior journals of the State had made upon it, and under
took to eneer at their proper and forcible criticisms in a spirit of
boastful levity. The readers of the Examiner were led to believe that having entered
upon this sort of publication it would continue to reproduce a daily estimate of its
own un worth from the columns of its couteniporarir s, regardless of how true or how
severe such comments might be.
With an earnest desire to assist the Examiner in collecting the cabbages and dead
cats and overripe things which the country press was engaged in heaving at it,
The Call with some degree of care collated the most apt and exact
opinions about the Examiner, as expressed by its contemporaries, and submitted
them to it for republication. For some unknown reason, however, the Examiner
has not seen fit to accept our well-meant assistance or to continue its double-column
display of unwelcome truth respecting itself. In fact, its Long Green editor does not
appear to appreciate the earnest desire of The Call to lighten his labors in this re
spect.
In its issue of yesterday the Examiner furnished the public another striking exam
ple of its recKles3 disregard of either consistency or truth.
It stated editorially that The Call was attempting to create a diphtheria
panic in this City and that such an attempt had no foundation in fact
and was to be deprecated as a "dangerous and inexcusable newspaper
sensation." It then proceeded to quote what The Call did say on the subject,
which was that "Health Officer Lovelace declared yesterday that diphtheria was
epidemic in this City." The Examiner avers that the Health Officer never made
such a statement. The Call avers that he did, and, further, directs public
attention to the fact that in the local columns of the same
issue in whicn the Examiner makes this misstatement there appeared with flash pic
tures and under scare deads a one-half page article upon the subject of Diphtheria,
wherein it is stated 'hat "The Board of Health physicians have arrived at the conclu
sion that a serious condition exists owing to the prevalence of diphtheria among the
children of San Francisco,"
To the average reader this looks very much like a statement on the part of the
Examiner that diphtheria is epidemic, and if it is not the Examiner's scare head half
page is calculated to cause the few people who still retain some degree of confidence
in that newspaper's statements to think it so.
This trifling inconsistency between the local and editorial columns of yesterday's
Examiner has a simple explanation. It doubtless arises from the fact that its man
aging editor is just at present devoting all of his mental energies to the hopeless
task of clearing himself from complicity in the prize-fight fraud and robbery, and
has therefore no time to devote to the equally hopeless task of keeping the Exam
iner consistent with itself.
STREET IMPROVEMENT.
The splendid display of public spirit by
progressive merchants in various parts of
the City is one of the features of our civic
life on which we can look at this time
with the greatest gratification. The move
ment for better street lighting begun in
one locality has spread rapidly to others,
until at the present time almost all of the
more important business streets are in
volved in it. Improvements are being
made in all directions, and each successive
step serves to encourage others in the on
ward movement.
So rapidly are these improvement clubs
bein s ' organized that the energies of the
press are taxed to keep up with them.
The work of one is hardly recorded before
a new one is organized and further work
begun. The spirit that animates the move
| ment is in the fullest sense progressive.
!It goes forward all the time. It sees in J
I the accomplishment of every task a reason
; for engaging in the performance of an
other and counts all that has been done as
but the earnest of greater tnings yet to be
achieved.
It can hardly be doubted that this spirit
which prompts men to undertake improve
ments in the localities where they carry
on their business will in the end prompt
them to engage in larger works of improve
ment for the whole City. There will grow
out of these various progressive steps a
general municipal movement for public
improvements of all kinds. It is altogether
satisfactory, also, that the attention of this
rapidly developing public spirit is directed
mainly to street work. It is upon our
thoroughfares that our municipal reforms
are most needed. Our streets are at pres
ent paved in a way that not only entails
heavy cost upon traffic but constitutes a
disgrace to our municipal government.
They should be not only better lighted
but better paved and better swept To ac
complish all the improvements needed on
them will require as much energy as the
fullest public spirit can arouse, ana it is
gratifying to know that such a spirit is
now being directed to that purpose.
WATER THE ARID WASTE.
Among the important matters soon to
come up in Congress for settlement and of
especial interest to the West is the ques
tion of the disposition of arid public lands
which are susceptible of reclamation by
irrigation. There is no doubt that a hun
dred million acres of such lands could be
profitably watered by engineering works
undertaken on an immense scale. The
main problem for Congress to solve is
whether the great works should be under
I National or State control. The vast area
j could only be made to yield harvests by
the most economical use of the water
which would be available, and the Na
tional Government has no power by laws
now in force to prevent the improvident
waste of the water.
Secretary of the Interior David R. Fran
cis in his annual report says the public
domain is now 1,849,072,587 acres, and, ex
cluding Alaska, there are 600,000,000 acres
still vacant. If settlers continue to take up
land in the future as they have in the
past there will be little left at the end of
thirteen years. The Secretary urges that
every encouragement should be given to
actual settlers to take up these lands, as
that disposition of them best subserves
public policy. He reports 500,000,000 acres
of and land, and that one-fifth of this
could be reclaimed by the conservative use
of water.
The attention of Congress is called to
the necessity of legislation to this end.
The Secretary recommends that a choice
be made between two plans: Either the
National undertaking of a vast system
which would embrace the reclamation of
the entire arid districts from a general
source of supply, or else the adoption of I
the suggestion of the Commissioner of the |
General Land Office, which is that these i
lands be put under the control of the
States for reclamation.
The question i 3 of such great impor- i
tance it is to be hoped Congress will give ;
it such earnest ana attentive study as will |
lead to its speedy settlement. The waste j
of vast sums of money and a long delay in j
the multiplication of happy homes upon I
the now desert places may be averted by j
though if ul efforts to find some plan
wuich will stand the test of practical ap
i plication and need no radical correction.
There are good arguments for both of
the proposed plans. The scheme of a
great National system would have the j
advantages that always go with immense
power exercised with perfect unity of
purpose, and is worthy of careful consid
eration. On the other hand, the course
most in harmony with our methods of
j government would be to put the responsi
bility of controlling the work upon the
Btates which are especially interested.
The closer home we brine the accounta
bility the less the likelihood of delinquen
cies, and the evil of a possible failure
would fall upon those who cad the best
opportunity to avert it.
The experiment with the present law,
which authorizes States and Territories to
reclaim arid lands within their borders,
does not seem to have produced great re-
I suite. This, however, may be due largely
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1896.
to the fact that the law is regarded as
merely tentative, and the States are bold
ing back to see if the National Govern
ment will not undertake ihe work. Con
gress, therefore, should promptly decide
upon which course it intends to follow. It
is fall time the work of irrigatine our
arid lands on a large scale should be
begun in earnest.
PROTECTING THE GOVERNMENT.
The report of the minority of the Pacific
Railroad Committee, which has just been
submitted to the House of Representa
tives, shows that the efforts of the major
ity to rush the Powers funding bill
through Congress will be met with strong
opposition. The minority in a concise
document state many and weighty rea
sons why the bill should not be accepted
by Congress, and these will undoubtedly
have much effect in determining the votes
of members who have not already made
up their minds on the subject.
The report of the minority sÂ»ys:
Without any fault of ours conditions pre
vail which render it necessary for the Govern
ment to either lose an enormoihj sum of money
or to adopt a refunding scheme! but before we
can agree to any refunding scneme it ought to
be clearly demonstrated that the Government
would be placed in much better position than
it now is. Believing the Government's posi
tion would not be materially improved if the
terms of the proposed bill were carried out
we cannot assent to its provisions.
Among the amendments proposed by
the minority is one recommending that if
| the debt due by the Pacific roads be ex
tended it shall be at 3 per cent instead of 2
per cent per annum, as is proposed. An
other is a recommendation that a provi
sion be inserted requiring the law officers
of the Government to institute proceed
ings looking to a foreclosure of its lien
and the sale of the property in the event
that the terms of settlement are not ac
cepted by the companies. The report also
points out that if the Government extends
its mortgage it would in effect guarantee
the payment of the first mortgage bonds
and thus the bill would place the Govern
ment In a worse position than it is at
present.
The report does not enter into any dis
cussion of the merits of the proposition
that the Government should become the
owner of the railroads, but seeks merely to
provide a means whereby the interests of
the people and the Government may be
protected against companies which have
defaulted in the past and are likely to do
so again. It points out that if the Pow
ers extension bill is adopted the Govern
ment will be granting to the Pacific roads
a favor which has never been equaled by
any granted to a corporation before, inas
much as it will give to the owners of
those roads the use of the Government's
money at 2 per cent per annum when they
would be able to negotiate loans at 4 per
cent to the amount secured by the iirst
mortgage.
The report of the committee is so mod
erate in its tone and so conservative in the
methods suggested it is difficult to see
how any great opposition can be made to
its recommendations. It affords a safe
basis on which the opponents of the Pow
ers bill can make a fight against that
measure without involving themselves in
support of any extreme or radical mea&
ura of Government ownership. It, there
fore, gives encouragement to the belief
that we shall succeed in defeating this
measure as we have defeated former ones,
and promises a final victory for the people
in the long battle against the monopoly.
A TIMELY CONFESSION.
The Examin er stated yesterday morning
in one of its sslf-appreciative editorials that
"it had the first authentic news of the testi
mony that the Fitzsimmons-Sharkey fig-ht
was 'fixed.' " This statement is so com
pletely in accord with the evidence on that
subject that we are inclined to believe it
to be true. In fact, from the testimony it
seems to be quite well established that
the Examiner, through its editor, "Long
Greeu" Lawrence, knew that the fight
was fixed several hours before it occurred,
and that in consequence of that Knowl
edge its people had "money to burn" on
Sharkey on the afternoon before the fight.
COAST EXCHANGES.
The Independent and the Silver Advocate, two
weekly newspapers published In Han Bernar
dino, have consolidated and under the first
mentioned title will keep up the agitation for
free silver in that section of California.
Tiburon now boasts of a weekl* newspaper,
the Marin County Union, of which Sam D. Chat
ter ion is publisher and proprietor. The Union
iscieartand sprightly, and its editor reminds
its readers that mighty ouks from small acorns
grow, wherefore he ventures the hope that by
keeping abreast of the times the new paper
will rise to greatness along with the promising
towns of Tiburou and Belvedere.
H. F. Ellis and S. E. Wright, the new propri
etors of the Livermore Herald, conclude a
lengthy salutatory with this sage advice to
the Herald's rural constituency: "Let every
farmer study the science of domestic economy.
His home market is his own larder. Let him
supply it more and more from the soil he tills
and less and less from off the shelves
o! the grocery store. Let us learn to
live on what we have and not on what we are
going to have. Let us be content to have
enough and have a clean conscience. Let us
not make ourselves bilious with envy because
somebody else wears a plug hat and false
teeth."
The Los Alamos Ventral has entered upon its
sixth volume. The paper remarks that the
town has had a number of setbacks in the last
few years, but now the star ol prosperity is
seen to be rising in the distance, and the citi
zens are inspired to new hope and heartier
efforts. Los Alamos is the center of a very
lertile district and ought to bean excellent
little business place.
The Escondido Times is making commenda
ble efforts for the advancement of its home
town. Among other things ii remarks: "II we
would have a prosperous community, where
people will come who are looking for, a loca
tion for new homes, we must hush the voice
of the chronic growlers arJd habitual kickers ;
also bury petty local jealousies and let spite
work seek for jobs elsewhere."
The Etna (Siskiyou County) Reporter is one
year old, and, having emerged from the pe
riod of uncertain life which every newspaper
is supposed to experience in its infancy, now
makes its obeisance to the public as a healthy
member of the journalistic family. The Re
porter is worthy of the success it is achieving.
The Los Angeles Times is fifteen yean old,
and, in entering upon its new year, the eten
torlan-voiced publication of the orange land
declares its intention to continue to do all the
good it can, hoping "for no greater reward
than has been accorded it In the swift years
that count up to fifteen."
The Newman Tribune will, on December 19.
issue an illustrated edition, the object of
which will be to attract home-seekers from
less favored Eastern sections of country to its
own productive and rich locality.
The Fresno Expositor has started a crusade
against the "tin-horn" gamblers of the Raisin
City. Its endeavors are well employed. When
the â¢â¢tin-horn" procession moves out of Fresno
the Expositor opines that "the sneakthief, the
footpad and the bunco-steerer" will co, too.
NEWS OP FOREIGN NAVIES.
Two Spanish torpedo-boat, destroyers, Furor
and Terror, built at Glasgow, completed their
trials November 24, and were to leave at ouce
for Spain. Their mean 6peed on a three hours'
run was 28lÂ£ knot*. The Furor during her
trial had the full load of seventy-five tons
aboard, which is considerably more than the
load carried by the destroyers of the British
aud other Governments.
Late advices from the Orient state that the
Emperor of Japan was to pay an official visit,
November 25, on board the armor-clad Chin
yeu, captured from the Chinese during the
recent war, and great preparations were in
progress at the naval station at Yokbsuka.
Twenty-one warships and a number of torpedo
boats were to be in line for the occasion, a fleet
eqnal if not superior to any naval gathering
of United States war vessels.
The Corientes, one of four torpedo-boat de
stroyers built by Yarrow's for the Argentine
Republic, bad a successful trial November 18
under exceptionally severe conditions. The
boat on a mean draught of 4 feet 5% inches dis
placed 240 tons and carried a load of 35 tons,
including 50 persons, ou board. She attained
a mean speed of 27.359 knots during a three

The Russian armored cruiser Russia, built
at St. Petersburg and launched some months
ago, got stuck in tho mud in the Kronstadt
Roads, and all efforts to get her free have
failed. The latest scheme was to drive rows
of piles around \h-s ship to protect her from
damage from the ice in the river, and now the
plan of building a concrete wail around her is
seriously considered. All further efforts of
getting the Russia afloat have, however, been
abondoned until spring. The unlucky vessel
is of 12,330 tons, and was intended tc steam
tweuty knots. As she now lies she represents
a loss of $2,000,000.
Discussion of naval estimates in the French
Chambers has directed attention, as never
before, to the condition of the French navy.
Messrs. Lockroy and Clemenceauâ the former
especiallyâ have been very severe in their
criticisms, and even the Minister of Marine
has made unfavorable reports. M. de Kerjegu
declares that England is evidently intending
to possess a fleet equal, if not exceeding, all of
Europe. He affirms that the French arsenals
are badly organized, and that the coaling
stations are too few to allow of extended
operations. He believes that the present
French fleet is entirely inadequate, and that
the case is so urgent that France will only have
time to increase her warships by numbers
rather than by tonnage. His report concludes
with the significant remark that the aim of
every patriotic Minister of Marine ought to be
to push oa to the possession of a fleet capable
of ruining the commercial supremacy of
England at a given moment.
The Monarch, coast defense vessel built for
the Austrian navy and launched in May last
year, is approaching completion. She is one
of three similar ships of very pretty appear
ance and good design for the purpose in
tended. Their dimensions are 30G feet length;
extreme breadth, 55 feet 9 inches; mean
draught, 20 feet 10 inches, on which they dis
place 5464 tons. The speed under forced
draught with 8500 horsepower is expected to
reach 17% knots. The armor protection con
sists of a belt seven feet in width extending
five-sixths of the length of the ship, varying in
thickness from 10.63 inches over the middle
body and tapering to 5 inches forward and 8
inches aft. Above the water-line belt is the
battery armor, 3.15 inches thick. She has two
barbette towers 9.8 inches thick. The total
weight of armor is nearly 1700 tons. The
armament consists of four 9^-inch and six
6-inch Krupp guns.

HOLDING THE MIRROR UP TO NATURE.
Placer Argus.
Ihe Call is doing up the Examiner in tine shape. Willie Hearst owns^oth
that paper and the New York Journal, and it now occurs that while the Ex
aminer was blowing hot in San Francisco the Journal was blowing cold in New
York City. This was in a measure so during the campaign. There was an
evident attempt for the Journal to carry a gold rider early in the campaign,
but it finally settled down with Tammany to attempt to (Jrive Billy Bryan's
team to the Wnite House. Lately the Journal attempted to prove the verity
of the California airship whiie'the Examiner was caricaturing The Call pro
prietors for doing the same thing in San Francisco. And then ih3 Examiner
is unspeakably filthy in its methods. It is notorious that it was compelled to
call in one of its issues with absolutely obscene suggestions in one of its carica
tures. The fact is stiil fresh in the mind 3of our readers of the contract with
the Sotithern Pacific Company, on which several thousand dollars were paid
the Examiner for fair treatment, and how on withholding the residue all their
dogs were turned on the company. It hounded the Hon. Grove L. Johnson*
with all the persistency of a sneak thief just because he gave an honest ex
pression of feeling not in accord with their views. The Portland Oregonian,
very foolishly forming its estimates of California morals, gave us a severe
lashing, the oniy possible excuse being the reflex taken from the Examiner.
We say to The Call, jto ahead, and hold the mirror np to nature until the
people shall discern plainly what a rotten concern the Examiner and Journal
combination is, for a fact! We apologize to our readers for giving so muca
space to bo lilthy a subject and our oniy excuse is the verity of our comments.

that the principals of all public schools

The horror and awe of tragedy could
not long pervade the tenantless home on
Vallejo street. From the delicate vines
that form a lacewom of green as they
cling tremulously to the bousewall and
modestly aspire to surmount the doorway,
to the wealth of fragrant heliotrope which
banks the entrance steps â all the sur
roundings and aspects of the place seem
breathing something of p;ace and quiet
ness.
The groups of the curious and morbid
who had heretofore gathered in front of
the residence were not in evidence yester
day. Yet the place was uot deserted. All
day friend after friend opened the low gate
noiselessly as though in fear of disturbing
the sleepers within, and reverently passed
into the house. They were paying their
last tribute [of love.
With a natural reticence it had early
been decided by those who were nearest
and dearest to the departed, that there
should be as little ostentation as possible
connected with the burial. With delicate
sensitiveness they shrank from the
thought of having the features of their
dead friends gazed upon by those
among whom there might possibly be
some who were actuated by curiosity or
morbidness. For this reason they Had de
cided that the bodies should not be viewed.
The knowledge of this decision was pain
ful to many of the mourning friends â
more painful perhaps than those in charge
had appreciated. Scores who had loved
and been loved by the dead ladies called
to gently remonstrate.
The following is a characteristic letter:
824 Valencia street.
My Dear Mrs. Hale: After Mrs. Swift aud I
left you this afternoon on the sad scene ol
j your present duties, we talked long and
earnestly of our dear deed friend and agreed
to give you the result of our thoughts. What I
have to say is only a suggestion and will, I
hope, be treated with tne leniency due an
earnest desire to show our respect â reverence
lor that silent saint, your friend and ours.
Would it not be well, in consideration of Mrs.
Cooper's kindly nature, to give an opportunity
to some of those people whom sue held in her
tender care, to avail themselves of the painful
privilege <it looking npon her beautiful face
once more? This may at first seem not con
sonant with good taste, but upon reflection I
am sure you will think with me that a woman
of such wholesome prominence, of such
beneficent influence, should be laid in state
where the pooro&t of her beneficiaries might
be able unw more toeazeupon the lineaments
of that tender face. Think of what it may be
to them, and ask if s"he would not have clone
for them anything in her power.
Were she to bo laid in her own churchâ that
sacred place to her â for a period of some lew
hours, with orderly arrangement for ingress
and egress, many a person whose heart may
have been touched by her tender ministra
tions, or whose conscience may have beeu
awakened by her justice and moral foree â
certainly all those who loved herâ may sigh
their adieus. Moreoverj Mrs. Cooper was a
public woman, with the'public weal at heart,
and tho public reverence her; she is entitled
to all the honors that wonld be accorded a
man of like strength and usefulness. We think
it due to herâ due to her people, due to her
public. Wi.l you kindly consider the matter
from this point of view, and pardon if I seen
intrusive? Sincerely and sadly yours,
Elizabeth H. Oulton.
Those who are lovingly performing the
work of arranging the services ielt that
the rights of such friends were too strong
to be denied. Instead of having the body
of Mrs. Cooper lie in state at the church,
however, the. caskets were opened yester
day afternoon.
The caskets, surrounded by tearful
friends, were placed in the cozy little par
lor. A modest arrangement of flowers
was at the head of each. All afternoon
the procession of griei -stricken friends
passed in and out. There were women
rich in worldly goods who had been the
patrons of Mrs. Cooper in her charities;
there were scores who had been her b ne
ficiaries. There were tears alike for
mother and daughter. The two were in
separable, and the friends of one were the
friends of the other.
Arrangements have about been com
pleted for the funeral services to-day.
The pallbearers a? named at present â
though changes may be necessaryâ are:
John F. Mprrill. Professor Earl Barnes,
J. Foster, Dr. Jonathan T. McDonald,
Major Hooper. C. J. Lathrop, Horace
Davis, Lovell White, Edwin Sweeny and
John Taylor. Walter Bannett will act as
master ot ceremonies.
There will be a benediction at the bouse
by Rev. J. K. McLean, after which the
bodies will be borne to the First Congre
gational Church, where the principal
services will be held at noon. These will
consist of a requiem by the choir, under
the direction ot Samuel D. Mayer, as the
caskets are being borne to the altar. Dr.
McLean will read a scriptural lesson, after
which the congregation, led by the choir,
will sing a hymn which was always one
of ilr=. Cooper's fay ritesw Dr. Adams
will then deliver a brief address, followed
by a eulogy by Dr. McLean. It had been
an expressed wish of Mrs. Cooper that
Dr. McLean would perform this office for
her in ca.*e he â arrived her. After a hymn
Dr. Adams will offer a prayer and the
services in the church will close with an
anthem by the choir. At Laurel Hill Dr.
Adams will conduct the services.
It is expected that there will be a
wealth of floral tributes, and in order tnat
the church may be properly decorated the
following ladies have been asked to direct
the work: Mrs. Story, Mra. Jonathan T.
McDonald, Mrs. Louis Sloss, Mrs. F. B.
Cv ler, Mrs. Sperry, Miss (Jhilda and Miss
Mary Bates.
Many touching letters of condolence
have been received by Mrs. Gaden and
Mrs. Hale from persons who are them
selves mourning Mrs. Cooper's death.
Among these is the following from the
pastor of the Plymouth Congregational
Church:
Plymouth Congregational Church, )
1719 rt)st street. \
Pear Mrs. Gaden: My heart is too heavy to
write nt length; I am so sad! Our friends
peacefully Bank Into the outstretched arms ot
our Heavenly Kather. Earth is poorer to-day;
heaven is richer.
May God comfort the mourners, and they
are not a few. If I can add any solace or serv
ice please command me. Sorrowfully yours,
William D. Williams.
The friends of MrÂ«. Cooper have viewed
the remarks of Rev. J. T. Blanchard of
Chicago, Dr. C. O. Brown's friend, with
pained surprise. They declare that the
story of her enmity to Dr. Brown on ac
count of a controversy which the latter
had had with her cousin, Colonel Robert
G. Ingersoll, is preposterous on its face,
and particularly so to those who had any
knowledge of Mrs. Cooper's character.
They deem Dr. Blanchard's remarks at
such a time not only in bad taste, but un
charitable *nd unchristian.
THE SAN FRACNISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1896.
Scene of the Exciting International Tug-of-War Commenced at Sutroville Yesterday, and Which Will Be Continued
Daily With Two Matinees Throughout the Week*
THEY ALL TUGGED
ON THE BIG ROPE
The International Tug-of-
War Started at the
Sutro Baths.
America and Ireland Proved the
Favorites in the First
Day's Contest.
One Full of Thirty Minutes, During
Which Neither Team Was
the Winner.
The interest in tugs-of-war does not
seem to have diminished in San Francisco,
judging from the immense crowd that as
sembled in the Sutro Baths yesterday to
witness the opening of the great inter
national contest for superiority of strength
â pure hard pulling for merit.
The vast amphitheater was black with
spectators, many of them being ladies;
the seats on the east side, which were re
served, were well filled and tne prom
enades were thronged with people.
Shortly before 3 o'clock triangular signs
bearing the names of the first of the com
peting teams were hung over the one hun
died and twenty-four foot cleated plat
form, which had been erected over the
smaller of the bathing tanks, "Denmark"
was hung over the southern half of the
platform and "Norway" over the northern
end. and as the band played the national
air of Denmark, the Danish team wearing g
uniform blue shirts wllh the letter D in
white on the bosom, marched up to the
platform, and then to a Norweigan air the
sons of Norway took their positions.
The teams were, Denmark â N. Larsen,
captain; M. S. Madsen, anchor man; O.
Johnson, C Swan, M. F. Clausen, C. Lar
sen, N. Anderson, G. Jensen. Norway was
captained by J. C. Johnson, and the mem
beraof the team were Bergu Nelsou, an
chor man ; Ole Johnson, Fred Oisen,
N. Wilson, H. Heiroon, J. Hudson and
Lou's Larsen.
When C. W. Freese, acting as referee and
timekeeper, fired the signal shot, the men
on each side buckled down to work and
for a few minutes it was an even tug, the
indicator remaining as stationary as if it
had been nailed to the platform. Sud
denly it. moved, going to Denmark, but be
fore it had moved one cleat it was bauleff
back. Then the captain of the Denmarks
gave a signal and his men gave one strong
pull and Norway went south two\sleats.
Then followed a test and theh another
tvs hard and strong. Denmark gained
the advantage and held it, the men
sliding backward until the top of the
indicator knocked the distance bar off its
pins. The tug was an exciting one and a
loud cheer greeted the winners. Time â 12
minutes.
Next came the United States and Italy.
The teams were: United Statesâ Peter
Buckley, captrfin; Tom Nolan, anchor
man;. A. McCaffel, 8. Pinkerton. Frank
Scbade, Billy Morgan, James Manning
and George Brickedell. Italian team â
Joseph Merani, captain; J. Gabarino, an
chorman; G. Gasper, F. Christo, G. Tor
lero. G, Anurea, F. Parodi and Vie. Vacar.
The teams were not evenly matched, for
the sons of sunny Italy were much lighter
than those who represented the United
States. Still they went to work witn a
will, and for a time it was doubtful ii the
stronger team was going to have a walk
over. But there came a moment when the
Americans gained a point and kept it, and
at the end of 7% minutes they had pulled
their opponents over the winning line.
Then came Ireland and Slavonia. The
Irish team was captained by James Herd
nedy and James Cameron was the anchor
man. The ether members of the team
were: John J. Cameron, Walter Bpntly,
John Rogers. James Smith, Jerry O'Dowd
and Arthur McMahon. The members of
the Slavonian team: A. S.indon, captsiin;
T. EJminster, anchorman; Joseph Kurn
cocy, J. W. Huserick, O. M. Edminster, Z.
W. Bastalta, L. Berry and Sieve Powell.
The Irish team had atfethe heaviest men
to the front and it was nox lons before the
effect of this arrangement was made ap
parent. After a few minutes ol heavy
tugging on botn sides the Irish team
started their opponents off their feet and
in 6 minutes and 10 seconds won the tug.
The next, was between Canada and
Portugal. The Canadians were captained
i.y George Duplissea. Robert Smith was
anchor-man and ttie members of the team:
F. A. Martin, Dan McPherson, James
Jordan, Gus Hoffman, Joe Gibson and 11.
M. McDonald. A. Bourguin was^aptam
of the Portuguese. A. Silva, anchor-man ;
Tony Enoa, D. Jackson. Pete Silver, V.
Furio, G. Angelo. J. Chilico were the
workers. This was an interesting tug'and
the men seemed equally matched as to
strength, but Canada proved to be the
stronger in 8 minutes and 35 seconds.
Then came ihe last tug of the aiternoon,
Germany and Sweden. The captain of the
German team was C. Weller; J. Kruger,
anchorman; F. Gunter, A. Winter. S.
Grosman. W. Barth, J. Wagner and Gus
Miller. Tho team from Sweden, all men
wbo work at the rolling mills, had for cap
tain A. M. Planck, Ed Anderson, an
chorman; G. Lund, H. Bloom, E. Nielson,
Ed Bloom, E. Forselt iind Peter Anderson.
Tiiis was one oi the finest displays of
hard pulling. The indicator went from
one side to the other in the center, and
what one lost the other regained. Then
the men from the rolling mills pulled with
a will and soon got the mastery. Germany
was forced to give up and Sweden won in
9:15.
Tim bettine was Denmark 10 and Nor
way 5, America 10 and Italy 5, Ireland 10
ana Slavonia 4, Canada 10 and Portugal 2,
Sweden 10 and Germany 2.
The first tug of the evening was be
tween Canada and Denmark and was one
of the best contested ones of the first day
and n'ght. The men worked for all there ]
was in it and at the end of the time limit, j
I thirty minutes, neither had been able to
lira ff the other over the line. The anchor
men of the teams were so stiff from the
half-hour's exertion they were unable to
rise without assistance. The referee an
nounced that the bets on the tug would
not be decided until the final pull.
After this Sweden and Italy went at it
again. This also was a good show of en
durance and for several minutes neither
side won a cleat, but then Sweden got in
its work and carried the indicator over the
line.
The next was between America and Nor
way, and it was a walkover for America.
There appeared a strong determination on
the part of Norway to hold fast, but two
minutes after the signal America gave a
strong pull and the men from Norway
were hauled ever without an opportunity
to catch a cleat to save themselves.
Then came a tug between Ireland and
Portugal, with bets 3 to 1 on the men from
the Green Isle. The effort showed that
their opponents were not in it â not a little
bit â for they were following the indicator
from the first, and in thirty-five seconds
the Irish team was the winner. This, the
shortest tug, was loudly applauded, and
the band played "Wearing of the Green"
with unusual vigor.
The last pull of the nipht was between
Germany and Slavonia. This pull was
also short but well contested. The Ger
mans proved the victors in two minutes
and ten seconds.
To-night the tournament will be re
sumed at 8 o'clock, and after a day's rest
the various contestants will be fresh for
the fray.
During the afternoon Tom Sharkey
and Danny Needham cave an exhibition
match. Sharkey was asked if if he should
be announced as the champion heavy
weight.
He replied with that remarkable modesty
that has marked his course ail along:
"Naw; I'm the champion of the world;
didn't the referee say so?" And he was
so announced.
Sharkey moved around with the agility
of a cat and didn't appear like a man who
had been seriously affected by a toul
blow. Needbam, who is rather alight
weight compared to the sailor, proved
himself, in the several rounds, the more
graceful and scientific boxer.
MONDAY NIGHT SHOWS.
The Several Kntertainmenta That Are

BURGLARS IN THE
WESTERN ADDITION
Residence of Mrs. Michaels,
1436 O'Farrell Street,
Entered.
Silverware, Jewelry, Wearing
Apparel and Other Articles
Stolen.
Three Yonng Men Who Drove Up to
the House in a Wagon Suspected
of Being the Burglars,
Burglars seem to be doing a wholesale
business in the Western Addition, as they
drive around with a horse and wagon to
move easily and expeditiously their plun
der to a nlace of safety.
Between 8 and 9 o'cioc* Saturday night
a horse and wagon stopped in front of the
residence of Mrs. Michaels, 1436 O'Farrell
street, and three young men jumped out.
One of them rang the front-door bell, but
there was no response, as Mrs. Michaels
and her family were visiting at the resi
dence of Sergeant Lindheimer, 1117 Geary
street, who is Mrs. Michael's father.
Two of the young men, after waiting for
a minute or two. disappeared into the
house by using, it is supposed, a skeleton
key and the third remained outside as a
lookout. In a few minutes the other two
came out of the house, each carrying a
large bundle, which they placed in the
wagon, and then the three drove off.
Mrs. Michaels and her family returned
home between 10 and 11 o'clock and they
were amazed to find everything in dis
order. All the bedrooms bad been vis
ited and the bureau drawers and closets
ransacked. Her son, Joseph's, dress suit,
his goid watch and chain, and other ar
ticles belonging to him were stolen. Silk
waists, hats, and otuer articles of wear
ing apparel, belonging to herself and
daughters, were also stolen, and a trunk
in which was contained her silverware,
most ol which was her wedding presents,
had been broken open and the silverware
carried away. The interior of the house
was practically looted, almost every
article of jewelry going along with the
others.
Detectives were detailed on the case
yesterday, but with little chance of dis
covering the burglars. Some of the neigh
bors saw the three young men drive up to
the house in the wagon and two of tnetn
enter, but they did not suspect that Mrs.
Michaels was not at home and paid little
attention to the burglars, so that a de
scription ot them cannot be obtained.
On the previous Saturday night the resi
dence of Mrs. N. J. Franklin, 1410 o'Far
rell street, two doors from Mrs. Michaels'
house, was entered by burglars and
looted, and it is believed that both bur
glaries have been committed by the same
men.
Two winters spo numerous burglaries
were committed in the Western Addition
by a lone burglar, and although nearly
the whole police force blockaded the
streets for weeks they were unable to
catch him. There have been several bur

mo far there has been r.o clew to the men.
Another burglary was reported to the
police yesterday morning;. It was at the
residence of C. B. Rode, 45 Zoe street, on
on Saturday night. Mr. Rode and his
family went downtown and on their re
turn they discovered that the place had
been entered by burglars, who took $350
in coin and a diamond shirt stud. A skele
ton key had been used to open the front
door. Detective Harry Reynolds was de
tailea on the case, but so far he has been
unable to rind a clew to the burglars.
THE BOXERS TO-NIGHT.
Hiram Cook Asked to Referee the Con-
testa at Woodwards.
To-night tbe quartet of feather- weights â
Anthony, Ward, Rochette and Gansâ will
glove their ambitious fist 3 and interview
each other in their pugilistic way for ten
rounds at Woodward's Pavilion. They
are all lively little fellows and their re
spective records in the ring show up well.
It will probably be give and take hard
and quick in both contests.
Anthony and Ward will fight at 115
pounds apiece and Rochette and Gans at
130. At (Jorbett's last evening Anthony
and Gans were the favorites over the\r
respective opponents at 10 to 8, with
plenty of money for Rochette and Ward.
The Occidental Club has asked Hiram
Cook to referee the contests. Manager
John Mitchell does not want any Earp
work or a decision from which every
lover of t-port and lair play will dissent.
Without doubt the gentleman so unani
mously chosen will consent to act, and the
public may rest assured of a square deci
sion.

THE CURSE OF MONOPOLY.
Plea for the Abolition of the Private
Ownership of Public Utilities.
The hall of the Socialist Labor party
at 909 Market street was crowded last
night by an audience eager to hear what
Gree Majors had to say on the subject of
â¢â¢The Private Ownership of Public Utili
ties."
The lecturer delivered a short but pithy
address, in which he gave some interest
ing facts and figures. The system of pri
vate ownership of public utilities in
volved, he contended, an enormous cost
upon the public, amounting to something
like $82 per capita per annum. This ex
pense is attributed chiefly to thÂ« private
operation cf railways, telegraphs, tele
phones, etc.. and to usury. The average
worker produces about $1818 a year, of
which he receives $347, the balance being
absorbed by the capitalist. In other
words, the laborer produces $(> a day and
gelssl. The only hope of amelioration,
in tlie lecturer's opinion, lay in a ceaseless
propaganda which must appeal to self
interest and avoid metaphysical the
orizing.
Branches cf the Socialist Labor party
have recently been organized in Santa
Barbara and Hollister.

Open Meeting of the Ladies'
Auxiliary, A. 0.

A Large Hous? Applaurs Irish
Talent, Musical and
Oratorical.
Patriotic Speeches by Father Crowley,
Chairman Fannerman anl
Dr. T. J Galvrn.
The Ladies' Auxiliary of the Ancient
Order of Hibernians of America held its
annual open meeting and entertainment
in Odd Fellows' Hall yesterday afternoon.
Martha Washington Circle was responsible
for an excellent programme, judiciously
composed of oratorical and musical
features, both of which had a decidedly
national and patriotic flavor. The hall
was well filled.
T. P.. Bannerman, introduced by Mr?.
Jerome Deaay, tooK the cliair at 2:30
o'clock, and indulged in a commendablv
brief opening address, which was cordially
received by bis hearers. He congratulated
the officers and members of the auxiliary
on the liberal patronage accorded its an
nual open meeting, which ho regarded
as a happy angury.
Speaking of the organization itself, he
said that to his mind the most important
and praiseworthy portion of its work was
v determined effort to strengthen and
perpetuate family life, a veneration for
whose sanctity has always character iz -d
and immortalized Irish women.
In^ the absence of Miss M. Need. Miss
McKenna contributed a spirited i iimo
solo to the programme, and was followed
by Rev. Fattier Crowley, who devoted his
address to an explanation of the aims and
objects of the ladies' auxiliary, in the
course of which he managed to say a good
many gallant things of the sex. One of
the oruer'a primary object*, he said, was
to perpetuate the best traditions of the
Celtic race; as also to foster patriotism for
the flag under which we live. From Lex
ington to the surrender of Lee, he main
tained, the Irish have always shown
themselves foremost in the struggle for
liberty.
Miss Katherine Black 3ang several Na
tional selections in admirable style, and
was loudly encored on each occasion. Her
sister. Miss Fanny Blaclc, was equally suc
cessful as an elocutionist, her choice and
treatment of subject, albeit undertaken at
a moment's notice, achieving instant pop
ularity.
The last orator on tne programme was
Dr. Thomas J. Galvan, who spoke for up
ward of half an hour with an eloquence
typically Celtic, and although perhaps un
duly tinged witn the"deathrock me asleep
spirit his period* were epigrammatic,
spirited and patriotic, and as such warmly
applauded. He reminded his hearers that
Ireland had not only produced apurilist
like Sharkey, but also a soldier like I* nil
Sheridan, and pleaded for greater co
operation among those of that race to
stem the tide of Saxon prejudice.
The following committees attended to
details:

THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Champion* Blordan and Donnelly De
feated by J. C Nealon and
T. F. Bonnet.
The San Francisco Handball Court was
crowded yesterday afternoon, the attrac
tion being a ganu in which J. C. Nealon
and T. F. Bonnet played against John
Riordan, the coast champion, and P. T.
Donnelly, the amateur champion.
The game had been on the cards for
several weoks, but owing to sum- unfore
seen circumstance it did not take place
till yesterday. It was expected that the
two champions would play all round
Nealon and Bonnet, but nevertheless a
great game was looked for. In this latter
expectation the spectators were not disap
pointed, but the outcome was a genuine
surprise. Nealon and Bonnet won the
first game and Riordan and Donnelly the
second and third. They looke 1 like sure
winners, but Nealon and Bonnet pulled
themselves together and won the next
two amid the wildest excitement.
The champions did not at all like their
defeat and challenged the winners to play
next Sunday. It was at once accepted.
James Stanton, the oldest handball-player
in the City, was an interested spectator of
the game.
The Union court will be opened next
Sunday under new management and
various attractions are promised. During
the week the walls will be plastered and
whitewashed and everything done to
make the court attractive.

Pastor Whitaker Makes Another
Ojslaught' on Church Fairs
and Bazaars.
Oakland Office Sah Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 13. j
Many of the people who are now putting
themselves >orward as desirable and log
ical candidates for city oihees present a
strange contrast to the class of citizens
upon whom these honors were bestowed
many years ago.
During the past few weeks many names
have been presented through various chan
. uels of men whose absence would be a
benefit to the community, and while there
is little i ope of their aspirationa ever
being parsed upon by the body of voters,
they work an incalculable evil. The asso
ciation of their names with any oince in
the gift of the people acts as a deterrent to
men who are honorably fitted to discharge
official duties, but who refuse to have their
names mentioned in any such connection
because of the cloud thrown over such an
aspiration by the character of the political
place hunter.
A little while ago, when an old building'
was torn down, in the cornerstone was
found a paper containing a "Citizen's
Ticket" of many years a.- o. Every name
on it was that of a solid, honorable citi
â en, and it is almost unnecessary to say
that it was elected. There was a leading
lawyer, who was afterward a Justice of
the Supreme Court; another man who
became Mayor, and four or five highly
r.'spected citizens, who have since proved
that their claim, even at that early date,
to be considered lit for office, had a sure
foundation.
If such a ticket be placed before the
people of Oakland at the coming election
it will undoubtedly meet with the same
bucces*. For several years Oaklanders
have been berating themselves for their
lack of public spirit and they will still
have cause to do so so lone; as a few men
who have nothing to lose and evervthm
' io gain by the success of their schemes
are able to dictate who shall rill the re
sponsible positions in this city.
Rev. Robert Whitaker of East Oakland
still keeps up, through the organ of his
church, the Pacific Baptist, nis war on
church fairs and bazaars. In the latest
number he takes up the article published
in Ihe Call some weeks ago and reviews
the interviews of which it con-isted at
some length. He '.-ays he does not ques
tion the honesty and intelligence of many
who apologize for such things, but he de
' elates they speak from the standpoint o:
interested witnesses. He says, li We still
abide in the opinion that church fairs and
bf-.zt.irs as conimoniy carried on are
tarthly, s-ezisual and devilish."
WW - not <ieny that fairs and
boz.turs may possibly be conducted a-j a
means of praco, Editor Whiiaser does not
consider they have any part in the true
church practice. He instances a case in
Philadelphia and suys he has been assured
that in this instance there is an orgau.zu
tion of evangelistic forces that make lairs
and bazaars really revivals in which hun
dreds are converted. He then makes a
iree offer ot a whole paste advertisement
" to any fair or bazaar held on this coast
which will accomplish any such results.
TuatMr. Whitaker does not believe in
any such theory Is evidenced by his re
mark, "Ourexperience is that church lairs
and bazaars are about as likely tc converi
people as a uorserace-or an industrial ex
position. Tne best thing that can be said
for them is that they make money."
There is now little doubt but that Oak
laud will have a representative Republican
government elected next March. The
â  Non-partisan element, most of whom are
Republicans, have shown a desire to unite
with the regular party provided that a suf
ficient representation s given them. The
Non-partisans at neHLerof their previous
conventions have elected their delegates at
primaries, and the plan of selection by ap
pointment will be carried out in this'cam
paign. Tne Republicans ure not anxious
to undertake the expense oE holding pri
mary elections for delegates for th- city
conventions) and have shown a desire to
follow the example set by the Non-parti
flans. With inclination to unity from both
sides, it is very likely that but one strong
Republican ticket will be placed belore
tnepeopip. Should this plan be followed,
there i-> no doubt of its success at the polls,
for Oakland was n-ver more truly Repub
lican than at this rime.
Under these conditions there will prob
ably be only two tickeis in the field. The
other one will be a combination of all the
lesser parties and wi.l probably not be
known as erther Democratic or Populist,
but as a silver ticKet. An effort will un
doubtedly be made to have it appear that
tbe latter ticket is that <.l the working
men, but; this will be a difficult, matter in
the face of the evidence put forward by the
workingmen of their allegiance to Repub
licanism in the memorable parade of No
vembers.
A copy of a London newspaper wag re
ceivea in Oakland this week, which con
tains one of those stupid, misleading arti
cles of the condition of society on the
Pacific Coast that work so much unjust
barm to this locality in foreign cities.
Some one signing himself-G. W Steevens
has forwarded a long article to the London
Mail, and his initial sentence is typical or
the remainder. He says: "San Francisco
-is the Pacific Coastâ the metropolis of an
empire, roughly a dozen times the size of
EnL'land; here, so runiOr says, We.-t-rn
Ireedom from restraint takes a special
form. It is said to be the one city of
America where you can maintain a semi
> official wife without the len-t prejudice <o
' your position in society. Many of the fair
maidens of San Francisco, remarks the
local guide-book genially, !inve memories
of gallant times at the Cliff House that lie
buried in their heart? as their greatest se
crets. The bistrry of many a midnight
revel there will forerer lie buried in ob
livion."
To a resident on the Pacific Slope who
is not accustomed to the general interest
and canfidence placed by the average
British reader in letters from foreign cor
'respondenis the language of Mr. Steevens
cunnot possibly convey as objectionable a
moral as to the readers of the Mail. Ii
Mr. Steevens were the only offender his
remarks might be pa.-sed by without com
ment. But he only represents one of a
large number of unrelinble louring "cor
respondents," who are periodically
iioodiiig British journalism with mis
representations of the state of so
ciety on the Pacific Coast. Such
writers never find spnee to treat of such
noble women as Mrs. Phoebf Henrst, Mr?.
Sarah B. Cooper, Mrs. Pettee, Mre. Stan
ford, and many others that could be
named, but seemingly take pride in glean
ing a few ideas from the disreputable por
tion ol t c City and holding them forth as
samples of the rest. Nothine is ever said
about the people who form the social
backbone of the community, and it is safe
to assert that if these wandering corre
spondents were to live here long enough*
to become naturalized they would be able
to send abroad something truthful that
might at the same time be of some use as
a guide to the true conditions of society
on Ihis coast. Stuart W. Booth.
LARGE CLASS CONFIRMED.
Sacred Rites Administered to Twenty-
Seven Young People at the Berk
eley Kplacopal Church.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 13.â Bishop
Nichois of the diocese ol California con
firmed a cla~s of twenty-seven at St.
Mark's Episcopal Church this morning.
As the topic for his sermon to the congre
gation he took "Preparation for Christ,"
after which he delivered an address to the
confirmation class.
After the Bishop's remarks the wardens
and vestry were called to the chancel for a
special service of prayer.
"We have made a definite engagement
with Bishop Nichols." said Rsctor Swan,
"to be with us on Easter morning. We
consider this a considerable honor, be
cause of the many requests he will doubt
less receive from larger conuretratious to
be preent with them on that day. The
B shop evidently regards this parish as an
important one. Its growth nas been very
rapid in the last year. Thouek our build
ing was recently,enlar}jed many people
were turned away this morning for luck of
room. This condition again calls atten
tion to the necessity of the new flifica
which the board has under contempla
tion."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1896.
FIRE DESTROYS
OLD ST. JOHN'S
Was the Pioneer Protestant
Place of Worship in
Oakland.
Forty Three V ars Ago the Con
gregation Met Under
the Oaks.
Tae Aged Pastor, Father Akerly,
Who Built the Church, Is
Seriously 111.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, Dec. 13. J
St. John's Churcl), which has been one
of the landmarks of Oakland for nearly
forty year?, was destroyed by fire early
this morning. Just before the Sabbath
dawned flames wer* discovered issuing
from tbe lrout of the main chancel and
Old St. John's, the Pioneer Episcopal Church of Alameda County,
Which Was DÂ«stroyed by Fire Yesterday.
before the Fire Department got fairly to
workâ and no time was wasted â the old
structure was nearly enveloped in flames.
The fire is supposed to nave originated
in the vicinity of the beating apparatus,
though no reason can be advanced why
such should be the case other than that it
was in the r.eighborhood of the heater
that the fire was first discovered. Every
effort was made to save the building, but
one-half was burned and the remainder
completely gutted before the fire was sub
dued.
St. John's has a most interesting his
tory, and everybody in Oakland regrets
its destruction. In August, 1853, the
church was originally established. Rev.
Dr. Ver Mehr, rector of Grace Church, San
Francisco, came over to establish th?
church, and with much difficulty a meet
ing of twelve persons was convened. The
first services were held under the oak
trees, after which a tent was erected with
a cross on top and a temporary pulpit
fitted up inside.
In December, 1854, Bishop Kip cele
brated divine service in a room that was
rented for tne purpose. TnÂ« following
January Rev. E. W. Svle became acting
rector of the young parish. In July, 1856,
Rev. James W. Caper became rector, but
resigned the following year, and was suc
ceeded by the venerable Father Akerly,
who is now the oldest Episcopal clergy
man in California.
Dr. Akerly at once set about the build
ing cf the structure which was destroyed
this morning. A lot wai purchased in
1860 for $450. and a church edifice erected
at a cost of $.600. Twice since then it has
been enlarged, but nothing can be done
with the ruins that remain, and a new
building is a necessity. The large lot on
which the church stood can undoubtedly
be sold .'or a sufficient sum of money to
build a church and purchase a lot some
whero in the parish. It stood in the mid
dle of a block, was surrounded by Old oaks
and did not occupy more than one-tenth
of the area of the laud owned by the
parish.
O;d St.-John's was justly regarded as
one of the prettiest scenes in older Oak
land. Its architecture, while partaking
somewhat of the nature of the church,
was certainly that of the pioneer type.
The low building nestled in a small forest
of oaks, and thousands of people passed
by the large block and have not known
that the building was a place of worship.
But for the cross over the entrance and
two or three pointed windows, the old
church might easily have been taken for a
pioneer ranch-house.
Father Akerly is confined to his house
with sickness, and owing to bis advanced
age grave fears are entertained for the I
future.
PEESIDIO WATER SUPPLY.
Twenty Thousand Gallons an Hour.
Frogress of Tunnel Workâ JTlre-
Fighting Troopers.
According to the report of Lieutenant-
Colonel A. S. Km ball, chief quarter
master of the department of California,
which was recently forwarded to the War
Department, a large and inexhaustible
supply of water has been developed at tne
Presidio. The water is found on top of
two clay strata, one lying about 50 feet
and the other about 100 feet below the
surface of Mountain Lake, and each sup
porting from 20 to 30 feet of good water
bearint? sand. The water stands in the
wells about 6 feet below the surface of
Mountain Lake.
Thirty-nine drive wÂ»lls, terminating in
the upper sand stratum, and two 45-inch
wells, sunk to the lower clay stratum,
nave been completed. The plant can
supply 20,000 gallons of water per hour for
any number of hours that may be re
quired. This is an ample supply for all
legitimate requirements on the reserva
tion, including the pneumatic batteries,
works of construction of the engineer de
partment, irrigation, road sprinkling and
the supply of the garrison.
The water is of sood quality, clear, odor
less, well aerated and suitable in all re
spects for domestic purposes. The water
is pumped through the main pipe line
over the Presidio hill to the reservoir at
the post. Thk highest point on this pipe
line is an elevation of 340 feet above mean
low water.
The greatest elevation at which water
will be required for use at any of the bat
teries is 305 feet, the pneumatic gun plant
beiue below this level. These batteries
could therefore be supplied with water
from the present plant by t c erection of
a tank or reservoir at or near the highest
point on the present pipe line, and the
laying of a gravity water main from this
reservoir to the fortifications.
Speaking of the tunnel at the Presidio,
which was projected years ago, Colonel
Kimball says:
â¢â¢A flow of between 500 and 1000 gallons
of water per diem has been developed in
the tunnel which is beins: excavated into
the Presidio Nill. This quantity may be
increased as the tunneling is continued,
but I do not expect to find much water in
the tunnel unless ledge ro<k be encoun
tered. The pneumatic gun plant batteries
and other engineer works of construction
are located at a higher elevation than the
tunnel. They could not therefore be sup
plied by water from the tunnel without
the additional expense of raising the
water with pumps. The water from the
tunnel may be conveyed by gravity flow
to tUe post reservoir at the Presidio, and
this is therefore considered to bft the best
disposition to be made of it
"Tbe contract for tunneling provides
that it may be terminated at the option of
the Government at the end of any 100
feet. The work is experimental in its
nature and I do not know how far it mny
be continued nor the probable quantity of
water that is likely to be developed. The
tunnel has been excavated about 550 feet.
The total length provided for in the con
tract i- 2000 feet. If it should be continued
tne full 2000 feet it might then without
groat addiiional expense be extended
through the hill to a connection with the
main supply line from the pumping works
and be used as a conduit for conveying
the water pipes from the pumping works
to the reservoir ana save the power and
consequent expense for fuel now necessary
in forcing thÂ« water through tho pipe
line over ihe hill."
The converted ei;rht-inch muzzle-load
ing rifles have been removed from the
works near the Presidio parade field and
placed near the lifieen-inch smooth-bores
at Fort Point.
Tne artillerymen stationed at the Prt
siciio hayÂ« now opportunity for instruc
tion in the duty of handling the high
power guns. The companies of infantry
at tue post perform garrison and guard
duty, and the batteries therefore have
time to drill. J; ,
Nine cows were slain at the Presidio last
Wednesday by direction of the Post Coiu
ihander, Colonel Shatter. Th" cows were
inspected and found' to be afflicted witn
lung disease.

ANTI-SALOON MEETING.
Gathering of EmhuÃiaÂ«t* at Simpson
Memorial Church to Organize Op
position to Saloons.
At the Simpson Memorial Church
yesterday evening there was a well at
tended meeting held for the purpose of
arousing interest in the Anti-Saloon
League movement. Tiie expectation is to
organize a City Anti-Saloon League here,
and another meeting will be called at an
early date at which this will probably be
accomplished. Cards are being gotten up
for the prospective members to sign which
will pledge them only to work against
saloons and declare an absolute neutrality
as to the different political parties as the
policy of he league. There are to be no
dues nor fees to pay.
The State ieague was organized about a
week ago, and after the City league is
formed it is contemplated, to get up smaller
orjian.zations representing the various
churches The metho i of worK on which
they will place most hopes will b â¢ to exer
cise a united and persistent influence on
the successive State legislatures until
they puss such laws as will be effective in
prohibiting the evil.
The meeting was addressed by four
speakers, id. P. Shedd led with an argu
ment for moral suasion, but did not think
that could be mitrie effective without the
aid of legal enactment. Mrs. L. P. Wil
liams, ex-president of the \V. C. T. U., fol
lowed with an account of the wonderful
bemfits the suppression of saloons had
wrouunt in M.aine. She is a native of that
State and was 12 years old before she saw
a saloon.
H. T. Hammond gave some statistics of
the liquor traffic, which showed the great
ness ot the evil, and the vast sums that
are annually misused In its purchase. The
estimate is made that there is a saloon for
every twenty men in San Francisco. He
drew a comparison between the State of
Maine, which prohibits ?aioon*, and other
wealthy States which do not by stating the
per ca"ita savings bank accounts. Maine
has $80 per capita in such tmnks, while
li.ino.s has but $6 12, and Ohio $9 42. He
showed that the city of Boston spends
more for liquor than the combined cost of
her public schools, parks and police and
fire departments, and estimates that San
Francisco spends a larger proportional
sum on liquor than Boston.
The last speaker was the Rev. John
Stephens, pastor of the church. He gave
s >nii- further statistics and closed with an
earnest call upon all those who are op
posed to saloons to unite for energetic
work. His idea of the work to be is to
bring influence to bear upon the LeÃisla
ture, for he does not think moral suasion
will ever be effective. This, he says,
shouid De done without any party affilia
tions.
GENESIS AND THE CREATION.
Key. \V. Rader l>elivers the First of a
Series of Biblical Discourse*.
At the Third Congregational Church
last night Rev. Wiliiam Rader delivered
the first of a series of sermons dealing
with the Bible considered as literature.
The title of last night's discourse was,
"Genesis and the Croation."
The speaker prefaced his remarks with
an explanation to the effect that he be
lieved in the scriptures as containing a
perfect rule of faith and practice; as a
fallible collection of books containing in
fallible and eternal truths. He believed
in the Bible's fallibility as a book and in
its infallibility as the word of God. It
was said that the only infallible book was
Euclid's Geometry.
"The making of this world," he said, is
the oldest and grandest fuct of history.
The Hebrew cosmogony is recorded in the
Book of Beginnings, familiarly called
Genesis.
The difference between the Christian
and the pagan account of creation is the
difference between a belief in a blind force
and a belief in a personal God. This
theistic conception distinguishes the ac
count i;i Genesis from all other cos
mogonies. Where ibis account came from
we do not know. Did Moses receive it
from Abraham? If so, where did Abraham
get it? Did Moses receive it from God?
If he did, he did not say so. The making
of the world is more easily accounted for
on the hypothesis of evolution than In
any other way.
"That hypothesis holds that the world
was not made 'Uddeniy; that the stars
were not struck out in the night as one
would strike a match, but that creation
was progressive according io the laws of
God, and under the guidance of iiis per
sonal presence and infinite wisuoni. Ac
cording to the Scripture creation was
originated by the Father, executed by the
Son and continued by the Spirit."
Next Sunday's discourse will be en
titled "The Fail of Man."
DEATH IN THE CLOISTER.
Mother Mary Thomas Pasaes Away at
St. Catherine's, Beuicia.
Mother Mary Thomas, O. S. D.,
secularly known as Margaret Golden,
passed away at St. Catherine's Convent,
Benicia, on Saturday after an illness of
five months' duration. The funeral will
be impressively solemnized in the Domini
can Church at Benicia to-day.
Mother Mary Thomas was the oldest
child of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Golden,
both well-known as early and hignlv re
spected residents of tuis State. When
merely a girl she responded to the re
ligious promptinss ot a naturally refined
and cultivated nature and joined the late
Rev. Mother Gomare, O. S. D., at
Monterey, whero that celebrated superi
oress had Jounced a community of the
Third Order of St. Dominic for women.
After entering the novi iate there she en
tered St. Catherine's Convent at Benicia.
It was not long before her many admir
able qualities secured recognition, and
she was elected superior-general of tbe
order on the coast, a position which she
held for ten years. She likewise received
the appointment of superior of St. Rose's
Dominican Convent in this City and re
sided here for some time.
The deceased enjoyed during her life
time wide celebrity as an educator, and
did much to instill into the minds of her
many female pupils a love for the best
English cia>sical literature. The two sis
ters of the deceased, Mrs. C. A. Macomber
and Mrs. A. D. Jenny, as well as the Rev.
Mother Louis, O. S. D., superior of the
Dominican Convent at San Rafael, at
tended her last moments.
EARLY MOR NING SHOOTING.
Bloods on a I*ark Create a Sensation in
Which the Police Join.
Stockton street, near Post, was the scene
of an early morning sensation, in which
several shots were fired by Police O fhcers
Douglas, Donovan and Farrell, fortunately
with no serious results.
The cause of the shooting grew out of
the conduct of Jack Williams, George
Bower, Tnomas Burns and James Smith,
who had been visiiing a house in the
vicinity at the early Hour of 4 o'clock on
Sunday morning.
In their exhilaration they broke a win
dow, and on seeing the officers approach
started to run. The officers gave pursuit
and, not being able to keep pace with the
fugitives, fired several snots in their wake.
This had the effect of bringing ih* quar
tet to a halt, when they were all placed
under arrest and taken to tbe Calitornia
street station, where they were charged
with malicious mischief.
They put up the requisite bail and were
permitted to depart.

TO A HIGHER LIFE.
Dr. Spalding Points to a Lesson in the
Life of St. John.
Dr. Spalding of St. John's Episcopal
Church took for his sermon yesterday
morning the words, "What want yÂ© out in
the wilderness to see?"
He told of John the Baptist's life, of
how he preached of Jesus and baptized
him, never doubting' that he was the Christ
for whom they looked, of how after he
was cast into prison he sent two of nis dis
ciples to the Master to ask if he were the
Christ or if they should look for another,
not sending them for his own sake, but for
theirs. Jesus told them to go and tell
John all they had heard : that the blind
received their sight, the lame walked, the
lepers were cleansed, the deaf heard, the
dead were raised and the poor had the
g#>pel preached to them.
From the last of these^Dr. Spalding drew
a lesson of missionary duty and said that
we should not thinK that our duty lay
only in our own homes and in our own
parishes, but thai each should help in aid
ing the preaching of the gospel to the
poor, not only the poor in wealth, but the
poor spiritually. He said that &t. John
drew men to him because, though he lived
in this world, he also lived above it, and
that jdstso now, if one does that he will
influence men for good and draw them to
a higher, nobler life.
TALKED OF THEOSOPHY.
Amos Johnson's Address at the Acad
emy of Sciences Last Night.
Amos J. Johnson of this City addressed
the open meeting of the TheosoDhical So
ciety last night in Academy of Sciences
Hall. He spoke on "God's Heroes and
Men," a subject that he treated as an ex
position of some oi the principles of
theosophy. In brief he said:
Every man is a god incarnate; every man a
spurt from the one divine flame of absolute
being that descends from the infinite foun
tain of life and courses torough eternity ou a
pilgrimage, the purpose of which we can but
faintly conceive. From the great unknowable
deity down to the lowest monad of the mineral
world there is a direct chain of heredity biud
ing all of existence into one harmonious
whole.
Following the lecture there were ques
tions of all sorts put by tbe audience and
answered by members of tue society.
St. Luke's Night.
To-morrow evening St. Luke's parish, in the
regular order of church nights, will give a re
ception to young men at the Young Men's
Christian Association parlors, corner Mason
and Ellis streets. There v.ili be a brief musi
cal and literary programme and a social h our
All members of St. Luke's church are invited,
to be present, as well as all members and
friends of the association. These church
nights are always exceedingly pleasant and en
joy able.

served mural paintings have been discov
ered at Kertoh, in the Crimea, the an

ARCTIO GOLD BURNS SKIN.
It Is tike a Blast From a FurnaceâKx
plorers ' niter From Thirst.
Dr. Nansen, who recently returned from
an arctic journey, says that the thirst in
duced by the irksome labor of sledge
hauling is the severest discomfort to the
explorer. Though the polar world is cov
ered with frozen water, there is none to
drink save that which is thawed, and on
the march it is almost impossible to thaw
it. Other explorers complain of the effects
of the wind and sun. It is well known
that a low degree of cola can be borne
without discomfort so long as the air is
still, but the moment it gets into motion
it strikes the skin like the blast of a fur
nace, says the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
lio effects have often been described as
precisely similar to those of a burn. The
sun, when it is visible, is hot and peels
and blisters the skin, making it infinitely
more sensitive to the attack of the wind.
O.'hers, again, cay that '.he warm relaxing
damp of the polar summer, with all the
diseases that it bring-, is infinitely worse
loan the intense cold of winter, but, per
haps, after all, tbe greatest evil and misery
which confront the polar explorer spring
from the depression] mental and physical,
of the long night of 2000 and 3000 hours of
gloom and semi-ilarkness.
Under its influence men seem to suffer
like plants deprived of suuh'/ht. A week
or so will oiten completely change their
characters, and the enforced idleness, uni
versal gloom and bitter coM combined, re

REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
The Outlook in Realty Mat
ters Is Premising and
.. Encouraging.
Inquiry Developing More Gen
erally ard Trading Becoming
More Positive.
The Usual Midwinter Dullness Bids
Fair. to Bi Less Marked
''â ',"' This Year. â 
Last week was a fairly good one for real
estate' business. Inquiry is developing more
ueuerally and trading is becoming of more
positive character, r Circumstances are almost
daily multiplying that nelp in fostering prop
erty, matters end give additional interest to
everything associated with land operations.
The midwinter dnllness in real estate, which
is usually first felt as the holidays approach,
bids fair to be less marked this season. Much
of the credit for this encouraging condition of
affairs must be accorded to the real estate
brokers, who are keeping up their usual quota
of advertising which in â  degree of power is
the first among stimulating agencies to the
market. There is no more reliable or practical
index to the financial condition of any com
munity than the real estate advertising col
umns of its daily newspapers.
On . the temper, energy and wisdom of the
real estate brokers is dependent in a great
measure the prosperity of San Francisco.
While her real estate men have always been
pushing and energetic they. have never gone to
the extreme of wild speculation or attempted,
by creating prices not based on actual value,
to inaugurate a boom which would prove more
disastrous in the- end than . a total state of
inertia. Those are the men who have repre
sented the City abroad and attracted popula
tion to extend the boundaries of the City
settlement. . They are the men who have not
worked alone, but have bent their energies to
the upbuilding of San Francisco. - In one re
spect their success is pronounced. In the per
centage of people who own their own homes
Sau Franc sco leads most of the large cities of
the Union.
The prosperity of the community lies in the
prosperity of the common reople; and thÂ«ir
prosperity is best indicated, not by high wr ges
and cool living necessarily, but by their own
ing homes. That person is tmly prosperous
who owns his house and has sufficient income
for a comfortable living. When a person has
a steady occupation that brings him fair â 
wages, so that he is enab ed to rent a com
fortable tenement, he soon discovers that a,
home of his own would be far preferable and
cost no more: for nowadays any one -can pur
chase aliouse on such easy installments tint
renting is really the more onerous. That this
realization has been felt by many is evinced
by th*Â» great increase of/the purchase of homes
and the corresponding increase of vacant tene
ments. -
The tendency toward home-building has a
stimulating effect on the real estate market;
it causes outside and other improved property
to be subdivided and sold for homes, and the
owners of tenements have to improve their
properties to hold their' tenants or sell to
those. wanting homes. Modern methods of
rapid transit have had much to do with mak
ing this prosperity possible, for it brings a
large territory within easy reach of the busi
ness part of the City. Du-ing a â¢ few years past
there has been a depression in the demand for
homes, but that is now, har.pily past, and
homes are being built on . every hand. Meas- ;
ured by home-building the real estate market
of San Francisco has decidedly a prosperous
outlook, and brokers look forward to an ac
tive, steady market.

Mach Interest in the Inter-Republic
Matchâ German Sharpshoot
ers' Contest.
Nearly all of the prominent ritte
shooters in this vicinity were at the Shell
Mound range yesterday. With them were
dozens who are not in the front row bnt
who are nevertheless enthusiasts in ihis
line of sport, and the five rifle, pistol nnd
military targets were kept on the move all
day.
Ihe Columbia Pistol and Rifle Ciubheld
its last contest of the year for the club's
class medals, but there will be one more
contest en the 27th inst. for there-entry
or all-comers' medals. On that date the
season's sport will conciude.with a team
shoot, rifle and pistol, in which all mem
bers will participate, to be followed by a
banquet at Captain Siebe's, at which all
the prizes will be distributed. As stated,
the winners of the class medals were de
cided at the contests yesterday. D. W.
McLaughlin won the champion class ritte
prize, his best four scores lor the year be
ing (Columbia Jarget): 52, 52, 56, 56â216.
F. O. Young missed by two points, his
total score being 218. In ihe first class F.
E. Mason captured the medal with 66, 74,
86, 82â308. He was closely followed by
H. K. Crane with 311 and A. B. Dorrell
with 318. E. Jacobsen won the second

closest competitor was J. E. Gorman with
320.
Mr. Gorman, however, consoled himself,
for he won tht champion ui<tol medal,
with 37, 39, 42, 46-163. A. H. Pape waa
only ten points behind, or 176, and F. O.
Young made 186. To a score of 30 in ten
shots made four months ago A. U. Dorrell
| is indebted for the tirsl-class Pistol prize.
His best four scores were 30. 49, 55,59-193.
It was expected that Dr. L. O. Rodders
\ would secure that prizg with 45, 50, 50, 50â
195, but Dorrell's 30 put the latter too far
ahead. Â£. Jacobson was the fortunate
winner of the secon<l-ciass pistol iuo lal,
with 55. 59, 66, 65â245. G. AI. Bailey for a
time had a chance to win on 262.

but Hovey brought the situation back to
two points in liis favor on an eight. His

THE PULPIT ON
A DECADENT PRESS
Rev. William A. Gardner's
Views on Lotteries
and GamiDg
Glad to Know That One Paper
Here Exposes and Opposes
Lotteries.
"Our Daily Pfpers Are Aiding and
Abetting These Nefarious
Institutions."
â¢'The Lottery and Other Forms of Gam
bling" was the subject of a vigorous dis
course delivered in the West-side Chris
tian Church, on Bush street, last night by
the Rev. William A. Gardner, the pastor.
Mr. Gardner was greeted with a large con
gregation, as usual, end it was evident
that his sermon caused a deep impression
on his hearers.
He said that gambling is more preva
lent to-day than ever before. Even boys
on the streets flip nickels. The preacher
saw it take place in a streetcar where two
men gambled for the two fares. And so
on, he said, through al 1 grades of society,
gambling is eating into everything, in
stores, in the Home, on the streets, every
where.
"Men who have entered our colleges
with bright minds were blighted by this
curse of gambling," he added. '"There
are iawyers who have been cursed by their
clients because instead of studying and
properly preparing their cases, they spent
their time in some gambling den. The
cause of the sudden fall of many promi
nent men is gambling â in the Stock Ex
change, in the Produce Exchange, in min
ing stocks. This sin or crime of gambling
has spread itself over society and is draw
ing down strong men. It is one of the
greatest crime- breeders in the land. There
is nothing else that causes so much crime
and sin â except the one vice of liquor."
Quoting from Chauncey Depew, he said
that 90 per cent of the crime in his experi
ence was due to gambling, and whiie that
is permitted to exist there cannot be mor- j
ality in public hie nor religion in the
churches.
"Tne sad thing of our State is that one
form of gambling is licensed by the law,"
he continued.
"The statutes of California forbid the
sale of an article by raifle. I see in the
store windows articles to be sold by raffle.
This is against the law. Shame! that this 1
sin should come into the church of Christ; !
that the church should thus be degrjded.
"The Lonisiana lotter}', when in full
blast in this country, received through the
mail about 30.000 letters a day and through
postal orders about $30,000 a day, or a little
more than $60,000.
"There was enougn paid into that treas
ury daily to pay for 120 comfortable
homes; in one year for homes for 42,320
families. At an average of five to the
family 221,600 people could be furnished
with homes in one year from these re
ceipts. To-dsy there are similar insutu
tions in Mexico, Central America and the
islands robbing the people of this land.
" 'Tis a shame that our daily papers are
aiding and abetting these nefarious insti
tutions by publishing their advertise
ments and carrying them into the homes
of our people and ihus acquainting our
children with this crime that is wrecking
homes and ruining men and women.
"I am clad to know there is one paper"
(he was referring to The Call) "in this
City, one of the great dailies, that tights,
exposes and opposes these lotteries. And
also that this paper refuses fat sums
offered it for those lottery advertisements.
The daily papers that pass through the
mails dare not have lottery advertise
ments, it would be a violation ot the law ;
and yet we give these papers that publish
Buch advertisements to our children to
read, these papers which should be' edu
cators instead of demoralizers."
Mr. Gardner concluded with a reference
to horse-racing and cards, and cautioned
his congregation against gaming.
A College and a Camera.
The California Camera Club has prepared a
pleasant entertainment, which will be held j
next Friday evening in Metropolitan Temple, j
O. V. Lange will deliver a lecture on "Through i
the University of California with a Camera." I
The address is to be Illustrated by a fine col- j
lection ol stereopticon views of the great Cali
fornia College, showing nil of the interesting
features of the establishment. This witi be

THE WILDCAT
AND CON MOONEY
Both Were Gathered in by
the Police and Landed
in Jail.
Some Particularly Cruel Sport
That Was Not Allowed
to Come Off.
A Eulldog's Life Savid on the San
Mateo Boundary Line by Two
Energetic Oificrs.
Con Mooney t the veteran promoter of
cock and dug lights, was cast into a dun-
["he Wildcat From El Dorado County That Con Mooney Was
Anxious Yesterday to Fight Against a Bulldog on the San
Mateo Boundary Line.
geon yesterday evenine by Officer Hol
brook of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Auimals.
With Mooney when arrested by Hol
brook was a wildcat, the largest and most
fierce ever captured in E. Dorado County.
Two charges were placed against Moon
ey's name and the cat was held as evi
dence. The two charges are: First, at
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1896.
tempting to brine off a fight between
dumb animals, and second, the use of vul
trar language.
Taking these chnrges which necessi
tated Mr. Mooney to put up $300 bail
money to a^ain roam at large instead- of
remaining a guest of Captain Gillen's, it
is prirua facie evidence that tbe old sport
is suspec.eri of an intent to do something
cruel to the cat, and being so suspected
and arrested he gave vent to his wcll
huna; tongue with which to lash Officer
Holbrook ia the choicest cockpit ver
nacular.
As a matter of fact, Con was said to have
been up to his old tricks. Although just
recovering from a severe attack of rheu
r.iati.-ra he has managed to get around in
his buggy and succeeded in locating a
wildcat. "
The animal was sent down here from El
Dorado County as a Christmas present, as
weil as a joke, to Billy Kenny of the Cos
monolitan Hotel.
Major Fahey, the proprietor of the
place, refused to keep tno vicious beast in
his house and Kenny was glad to unload
him on Mooney.
The latter immediately spread the word
that he was going to give his friends some
choice sport in the line of badger baiting.
There was to be blood, laceration and
i>:iiri to the sntisloction of everybody, and
those who delve in the love of cruelty to
animals were eacer to pay any figure from
$1 to $25 to be favored wiih an admission
ticket to tee sacrifice.
The tip was given out at midnight yes
terday that Ca^sidy's resort, at the Seven-
Mile House, would be the scene of
carnage. A henltny and vicious bulldog
from Barney Kiley's kennel had been
| picked out to meet the cat, and all holders
of tickets must be on hand at Ocean View
not later tnan 9 o'clock in the morning.
Con Mooney, without telling Cassidy
what he wanted his place ior, had rented
it for one day. In one respect he misled
Cassidy by asking him lo clear the floor of
I the big hall and put a piano in the place.
Cassidy, therelore, came to the conclusion
that Mooney was about lo give a party to
sume friends and that there would be
dancing.
But this delusion vanished with the ap
pearance of Otiicers Holbrook and Hooper
of the Society for the .Prevention of Cru
elty to Animals.
They were on the grounds before noon
and in hot chase of Mooney, the wildcat
and the dog.
In the meantime Mooney and a score of
swells, hor.Â«e-show n.en and bookmakers,
were made aware of the poiice b?ing atter
them ;o prevent the tight. They stopped
off at Wolff's place, next to the Ocean
View station, and were prepared to bring
off the figlit there, when the tall figure of
Officer Jack McGrevey loomed up and "it
was all off."
Mooney, with the cat in a huge cage,
took a circuitous route to Colny's place
opposite the Holy Cross Cemetery in San
Mateo County. Billy Kenney packed the
brindle dog in another conveyance and
after an hour's ride they came face to face
with Sheriff Kenney of San Mateo
County who qu etly suggested that they
might fare better by going back iroui
whence they had come.
The procession then took to the original
place â Cassidy's â hoping that Hooper and
Holbrook had vanished. But they had
not. Delegations, including such a states
man and clever talker as Harry Maynard,
argued with both officers that they had no
jurisdiction in San Mateo County."
"You are right," said Holbrook. "Our
office ceases in San Mateo County, except
ing to the extent of 500 yards beyond the
county line, which is allowed us by the
State law. This place is only fifty yards
lrom the line, and if you want io carry on
your rij-ht you'll have lo go 450 yards far
ther up the Jive and see my friend Sheriff
Kenney.''
In the meantime Con Mooney, wilder
than the cat he had in the box, was trav
eling over the hills to get back into the
City, when Holbrook overtook him and
placed him under'arre&t.
The most fortunate in the wildcat
ana bulldog matinee is the latter. Ho
weighs about twenty-two pounds, and the
cat tops him both in size and weight. It
is safe to say that the authorities length
ened the lease of that dog's life.

The particularly interesting feature of
the coaching party was the fact that it
was a contest for $200, a first-class lunch
and glory. Not a word was said about the
race to Burlingame by those in the event
until tho start was made from the Pavil
ion, shortly before 11 o'clock in the morn
ing.
The contest was among W. S. Hobart,
Henry Crocker and Joseph Grant, who
tooted their fours- m-band shown in the
ring.
Mr. Crocker handled his handsome bays
before his road coach, on which were
George A. Pope, George Newhall, Marion
Storey. Reginald Rives and Captain Bay
lard. The ex-ringmaster of the horse
show, Ricnard Uraham, volunteered to be
guard. Mr. Crocker had a change ot
Horses at San Bruno.
Walter Hobart went out with a picked
four and a cockhorse with a regulation
postilion carrying n crosstree; also a
guard in a ilaming scarlet coat bedecked
with brass buttons, and a fuzzy gray hat
which eclipsed Dan McCarthy's.
On the break wer* H. W. Kemp,
R. F. Carman, W. E. Lester and W.
Hobatt, who tooted his four-in-hand.
Mr. Hobart had three ci:a.nges along the
road, one each at the Six-mile House, Holy
Cross and MUlbrae.
Mr. Grant drove his elegant four-in
hand to a body break and had as guests
Joseph Donohoe, Major Rathbone and
some other friends. He had no change of
horses, and took the bay road, leaving his
competitors to the Mission road.
At 12:10 p. m., Mr. Hobart's coach pulled
up at the burlingama clubhouse, and
twenty minutes later Mr. Crocker arrived.
Snortly afterward Mr. Grant put In an
appearancp. The breaks and horses were
covered with mud that gav<* evidence of
wretched roads and a hard drive, still the
best time was less than an hour and a half.
Mr. Hobart won the prize of $200, and Air.
Grant wi.l have the pleasure of acting as
host tit a delightful luncheon either at the
Bnrlingame Club or in town, at which his
guests will be the party that rode in the
exciting race.
The afternoon was spent on the Bur
lingame polo ground, and in the evening
Mr. Hobart entertained the whole party
at his villa at San Mateo.
Charles A. Baldwin drove to the Bur
lingarae Club earlier in the day in his
yellow and black break with a four-in-hand
team, but he was not in the most remarka
ble race that has taken place in many
years in California.

CRUELTY IN THE
HORSE SHOW RING
The "Bucking Bronco" Was
a Gentle California
Horse.
Goaded Into' Rearing Over the
Fence by Spurs Through
His Flanks.
Ri flections of an Imported Grocm
on the Brilliant Society
Event.
An English groom reclined in the
oddest though swellest rig of young Mr.
Hobart at the Mechanics' Pavilion yester
day, and looked the picture of disgust.
He had the queer hood put up to add a
little to his comfort. His leel were
stretched out over the costly dashboard
in front.
"Aw" (be was half asleep); "aw, I'm
glad the bloody show is over."
He twisted about again in his master's
soft seat and groaned in spirit at the un
yielding back. Twelve hours before h!s
master was in the same box, full of the
victor's pride as be dashed around the
ring.
"What do I think of the show?" he
said in his own peculiar dialect.
"I'm beastly tired," and he yawned
again. "You can't have a horse show
with American horse?. Mister Hobart,
he's the only gentleman what knows his
business. I'm glad the bloody show is
over."
Whereupon he settled himself down
comfortably for a sleep.
But there were many 'more sleepy
grooms, watchmen and attendants in the
Pavilion, as none of them had slept dur
ing the night. They roust have put in a
busy night, for at noon yesterday not a
show horse remained in the stalls, harness
and rigs were nearly all removed and the
work of demolition of stables and horse
show fixings nad begun. Only the ring it
self was Jeft intact.
Its neefulness was not at an end, either,
as it served as a show-ground for Cal
ifornia-bred hackneys to be sold at auc
tion soon. A prominent gentleman who
became possessed of a strong desire to own
a coach and four examined .some of these
horses, and all but decided on four hack
neys Jor his prospective break. The show
cave him the inspiration, and soon an
other four-in-hand will be added to the
small but crowing collection of these rigs
in California.
The "untamed bucking bronco" that
scrambled over the ring fence Saturday
night was led away yesterday by his
owner, S. Guittard, a downtown mer
chant. Mr. Guittard was the only dis
gruntled and angry man in the building,
and he complained very bitterly at the
treatment his handsome black horse re
ceived at the hands of the inhumane rider,
who received jutt retribution in the form
of a broken collarbone when thrown over
the fence.
Little did the refined people who viewed
the vaquero exhibition dream that this
black beauty was a kind horse with excel
lent manners, and that he was goaded to
madness by vicious jibbing of terrible
spurs in the HanK-% the tenderest soot in
the horse. The spurs cut underneath and
inside the flank â a spot the true norse
man will never touch. Some of the most
skillful men about horses inspected Guit
tard's horse yesterday and declared that
he bad been treated worse than half the
bull* in a Mexican bullring. Tho>e who
passed such or a liKe judgment are Mr.
Hobart's and Mrs. Lester's head men, Mr.
Mitchell, an expert in 'horses, and others.
This horse would grace any road rig, or
make a fine showing under a sad tie. He
was raised on the Murphy ranch, near San
Jose, and was well trained.
"It was disgraceful, the treatment he
got in the ring,' 1 said Mr. Guittard. "This
fellow who rode him came to me yester
day. He ssked for a loan of tho horse.
'Let me have him for the night,' he saiÂ«l.
'I won't do ?nra any harm and will make
a few dollars oat of it.' He broke the
horse for me some time ago and I thought
he was all right, so I let him have a loan
of my horse. The next thing 1 knew they
had him in the ring for a bucking bronco.
You can see where the spurs were put
into his flanks that would make any horse
buck and it drove him crazy against the
fence. He reared when jabbed through
the flanks and fell upon the fence, then
ro'led over."
The horse was badly cut on the fetlocks,
the "arms" and in several places over the
trunk and hock*. Though utill nervous
yesterday he was gentle and did not once
betray a bad trait.

A DRUNKEN FREAK.
C. . McCarthy, a Mulder, . Arrested â¢ for
Driving Off With Another Alan's
â¢ Horse an I Buggy. : '
C. McCarthy, a molder, imbibed too
much liquor yesterday afternoon and see
ing a horse and buggy standing on the
corner of Turk and Tayior streets he
thought he would lifce a ride. He jumped
into the buggy and drove off at a reckless
speed aloiw Turk street. He turned south
on Van Ness avenue and one of the wheels
was broken by striking againat the curb
stone.
Policeman Campion saw him and no
ticing that he was drunk attempted to ar
rest him. McCarthy whipped up the
horse and Campion save chase, overtak
ing him on Market street. Campion ar
rested him for being drunk and took him
and the horse and buggy to the Central
Police Station.
Mentima the Central Police Station had
been notified by J. F. Power, 1611 Goagh
street, that his rig had been stolen ;rom
Turk and Taylor strtet?. He was in
formed of McCarthy's arrest and then he
called at the station and identified the
horse and buggy as his property. A charge
of "driving off with another man's horse
and buggy" was then entered against Mc-
Carthy.
