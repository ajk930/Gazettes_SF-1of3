"Trsgic EndiDg of the Young Man's
Record of a Misspent
Career.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 21.â As the
clock was striking 10 this morning, and
just without the portals of the local tem
ple of justice, James L. Lowe, scholar and
lawyer in em bryo, shot down the partner
of his guilty love, and ended his ruined
and wasted life by blowing out his brains.
The shooting occurred in the ballway
come twenty feet from the door opening
into the police courtroom, and but a few
feet from the open door of tbe City Attor
ney's < ffice. The City Attorney was at the
time engaged in making out complaints
to be sworn to by the arresting officer?.
Suddenly the report of a pistol rang
through the building, followed almost mi*
. mediately by a second shot, and simulta
neously the piercing screams of a woman
startled every one within hearing. The
next moment a woman sprang into the
City Attorney's office and fled through
into the adjoining office of Judge Davis.
She was May Melville, the companion of
the jnurdered woman. Policeman Michael
Fisher, who was in the office of City At
torney Miller, ran out into the hall just in
JAMES L. LOWE, Who Killed Miss Addie Schilling and Himself at
Sacramento.
time to see Addie Schilling, formerly Gertie
Stonehouse, the victim of the assassin's
pistol, fall to the floor, but before he could
interfere the murderer placed the muzzle
of his pistol to the back of his right ear,
pulled the trigger and fell dead within a
few feet of his victim who, with both
hings perforated by bullets, lay prostrate,
face downward, gasping her life away.
- Lowe's death was instantaneous. Seem
ingly not a muscle of his body stirred after
l.c struck the floor, nor did his hand re
lease its grip upon the gold-headed cane
i he always carried. His victim, however,
V J-ved for upward of two hours without
ever regaining consciousness. Both bul
let* from Lowe's pistol struck the un
fortunate woman in the chest. One struck
three inches above the heart, passed di
rectly through the right lung, marked the
top of the bench on which the woman was
sitting, struck the plaster and fell to the
floor. The other bullet passed through
the right lung and lodged beneath, the
ikin of the back.
At the time of the shooting Officer
James Douglass was in a closet bat a few
feet away, and as the third pistol-shot
rang out he rushed into the hall, pistol in
hand, and seeing a man standing in the
vicinity of the two victims, ordered him
to throw up his hands, believing that he
â was the one who had committed the shoot
ing. The onlooker promptly complied
with the stern command of the officer,
and Douglas was soon undeceived by his
brother officer, Fisher, who had been an
eye-witness of the last part of the shoot
ing. This bystander was Perry Johnson,
who, in speaking of the tragedy, taid :
"I am a watenman for the Sacramento
Transportation Company, and having as
sisted in the arrest of a band of hobos
last evening was sitting in the open win
dow at the hall waiting for court to open,
as I was required as a witness. Presently
I noticed two women come upstairs and
sit down on the bench, where they becran
chatting in an animated manner. The
. iyounger of the two had some letters in
â her hand which she alluded to as .she
Talked. Two or three minutes later a man
CVune upstairs, walked in front of the
women, and without naying a word drew
a revolver from his pocket and fired two
shots at one of the women, wbo fell from
tbe bench to the floor, while the other
woman fled screaming into the City At
torney's office. Tbe man then stepped
across the hall, placed, his pistol to his
The San Francisco Call
right temple, and pulled the trieger. Tbe
weapon snapped without exploding, and
he then re-cocked it, placed the muzzle
back of his right ear and blew his brains
out.
"The whole thing happened so quicily
that it was over before I could rise to my
feet. The next instant Douglas covered
me and ordered mo to throw up my hands
and I did so, and was very iively about it,
for he had shoot in his eye."
A friend of the dead man, who was
standing in front of the City Hall in com
pany with Lowe and conversing with him.
said:
"Jim seemed to be in a very good hu
mor when I met him, and after we had
chatted a few minutes he asked me for a
cigarette. Just at this moment May Mel
ville and Addie Schilling passed by us,
going into the Courthouse. As Addie
went by she gave Jim a very contemptu
ous look and tossed her head, as much as
to say: 'I'll fix you.' In a moment he
turned perfectly wftite, and when I handed
him a cigarette hi? hand trembled so that
he could hardly take it. At this moment
his attorney, Senator Frank Sprague,
came up and banded him a letter. Jim
read it, thruvt it into his pocket, left me ,
abruptly and entered the building. The
next moment the shots ran oat, and when
I ran upstairs I found the woman dying
and Jim dead."
May Melville, the companion of Addie
Schilling, said:
"We were sitting on the bench at the
head of the stairs chatting, when Jim
Lowe came up and stopped in front of us.
I never saw such a fiendish expression
upon a human being as he wore. It was
such a horrible look t:iat I shall never
I forget it as long as I live. Just as soon
as Lowe began tiring I jumped up and ran
away. He never spoke a word to either
Gertie or myself to give any indication of
what he intended to do."
The chief actor of the tragedy was
James Lowe, a young man who was a
comparative stranger in this community,
but who had become quite well Known
among a certain fast set. He has been
here four or five months. He dressed
neatly, carried a cane and was considered
quite "swell." Lowe was a genial fellow,
well educated, an entertaining conversa
tionalist, and he made many friends. He
wrs the son of ex-State Senator James R.
Lowe, a prominent lawyer of San Jose,
and hud studied law himself.
Addie Schilling, the woman in the case,
was a girl highly educated, vivacious and
a musician and vocalist of no mean abil
ity. - It is claimed, that she was born in

woman's weakness â and she was an out
cast.
Later, it is claimed, she met a soldier in
the ranks of the United States army, mar
ried him and their wedded lite lasted for
a brief five months. She procured a di
vorce and entered upon a life of shame.
Eventually she drifted into Sau Jose and
started a lodging-house^ There she met
young Lowe. He became infatuated with
her and forsook wife, family and all to ac
company her. For a time the course of
'iheir guilty love ran smoothly, but
eventually his funds dwindled away, and
at iast, driven to desperation, it is
claimed that he set fire to his residence to
procure the $980 insurance he carried,
and left San Jose in her company for Sac
ramento. where he has since resided. It
is claimed that, this sum being exhausted,
be began to draw upon the woman's re
sources, and at times treated her with
brutality; so much so that, fearing for her
life, she applted to the police to rid her of
her burden. It is claimed that on (he
night on which Lowe is said to have
burned his residence he confided his
scheme for obtaining a fresh supply of
money to the woman, saying as the
sound of the firebells rang out in the night
air:
"There goes my house. I set it afire
with a fireball and time fuse, and within
a few days we'll be fixed for money
again."
It is thought that this fact was in some
way conveyed to the insurance compa
nies. At all events, the latter detailed an
inspector to inquire into the matter, and
for several days past he has been in Sac
ramento tracing the matter out. Several
nights ago, in company with Policeman
Talbot, the room occupied by Lowe was
visited for the purpose of obtaining evi
dence of Lowe's crime. At the time the
officers believed the room to be vacant,
but they found it occupied by Lowe and
two companions. Fearing that his sus
picions would be aroused and that he
would flee from the country they placed
the men under arrest and preferred a
charge of vagrancy against them.
The men were released on bonds the
next day, and it was to answer to this
charge this morning that brought Lowe
to the Police Court and his death.'
That tbe crime was premeditated has
been proved beyond a donbt, as Lowe had
orenly threatened the women, and, itj. is
claimed, has written of bis intention to
others. The following letters, taken from
the women's had as she Jay on the floor

ILLINOIS DAY AT
McKINLEY'S HOME
Large Delegations Pour in
From Morning to
Night.
Pilgrims From the Home of
Lincoln Make a Fine
Display.
ENTHUSIASM UNRESTRAINED.
Handsomely Uniformed and Wei'.*
Drilled Voters Add to the
Animated Scenes.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 21.â Major McKm-
Jey bad the liveliest Wednesday he has
experienced in the campaign to-day.
There were three laige delegations, num
bering in the aggregate about 9000 people,
and several small delegations which de
manded their share of time, attention and
speeches. The day was called Illinois day
and there were many trainloads of visitors
from that Slate. Some of them arrived as
early as 5 o'clock in the morning. Among
the first to come were those from Spring
field, who wore badges on wnich were the
words "Pilgrims from the home of Lin
coln to the home of McKinley." The ora
tory which Major McKinley listened to
to-day was of a higher character than that
usually addressed to him, and while there
were large numbers of farmers and work
ingmen among the visitors there were,
too, an unusually large ftumber of men
who bore the stamp of successful urban
life.
Though it was Illinois day, the citiz-ns of
the famous old Nineteenth Congressional
District of Ohio, the district of Wade and
Garfield, had decided it as a fitting time to
pay their respects to McKinley, and they,
with Colonel W. H. Pond's superb Mc-
Kinley regiment of Cleveland, very con
siderably outnumbered the visitors from
the more distant State.
For the first time in, the campaign here
glee clubs made a distinct impression upon
the throng 9of visitors and campaign
songs were potent enough to sway a vast
audience. The Weber quartet of Chicago
was loudly and repeatedly encored when
it sang the Ohio and Illinois State Bongs.
Major Mc*Kinley was in excellent form
to-day, and his voice, notwithstanding
the face that a sharp cold wind was blow
ing and that he had to address people on
all sides of trim, was clear, far-reaching
and effective. The weather was clear and
bright, but cold.
At 1 o'clock Major McKinley received a
call from the members of the McKinley
Club of Lowell, 111., and a large party of
friends from Poland Township, Maboning
County, Ohio. This delegation, made up
of nearly 300 persons, received a cordial
welcome from the candidate. It was in
Poland Township that Major McKinley I
spent the greater-part of his boyhood and
from which he went as a soldier to serve
liis country. .These points were brought
out m the brief introductory address of
Judge Georcte Farrell of Youngstown, who
acted as' spokesman. When Governor
McKinley had finished his brief talk he
greeted each of his old neighbors with a
hearty handshake and a pleasant word.
The mounted escort of Chicago rode up
to the McKinley residence just as the
Poland-township people were leaving, and
Major McKinley, after reviewing them
from the platform erected on the front of
his lawn, complimented the escort upon its
excellent appearance.
I'he members' of the Garfield Cub of the
old Nineteenth Ohio District and their
friends, to the number of 3500, were the
next callers. They arrived on four special
tra'ns and were accompanied by several
brass bands and glee clubs. The old Nine
teenth District embraces the portions of
the counties of Lake, Porteee. TrumDull,
Ashtahula. Mahomng and Geauga. All
of these localities were represented here
to-day and the enthusiasm was unre
strained. After filling the McKinley lawn
the crowd literally blocked North Market
street in front, and Major McKinley was
obliged to abandon the porch for the more
prominent position on the platform, where
he could be more readily heard by all. Hi?
appearance on the platform was the signal
for a tremendous outburst of cheers.
The McKinley Glee Club of Niles, Ohio,
and the Weber Quartet of Chicago ren
dered several campaign selections and
then Captain Wallace, president of the
Garfield Club, introduced Congressman
Northway as the spokesman. When Ma
jor McKinley had finished he introduced
State Senator James R. Garfield, who
spoke briefly. Among others who accom
panied this delegation were Judge John
son and Lieutenant-Governor A. W. Jones.
The great Illinois delegation pressed
close behind the army of enthusiastic
.voters irom Gtirfield's old district. T.bÂ£
Illinois and Chicago people, escorted by
the Black Hussars and tbe Canton troop,
passed in review before Major McKinley
before he addressed them. After the pa
rade General John McNulta spoke in be
half of the Chicago Republicans, with J.
Calhoun for the State of Illinois, Robert
J. Given for the Republican club-; of Chi
cago, and P. J. Miniter for the labor or
ganizations. Major McKinley addressed
them in reply at some length.
A short time after the Illinois delega
tion departed about 500 laboring men of
Chicago and Illinois called on Major Mc-
Kinley, and told him they wanted to as
sure him that the workingmen of the
country understood the question at issue,
and that they considered him one of their
most trusted and useful friends. M. H.
Madden was spokesman. Mr. McKinley
responded briefly.
At sunset the Cleveland East End Mc-
Kinley Regiment, a handsomely uni
formed and drilled body of enthusiastic
voters, marched up to the McKinley resi
dence. They were preceded by their own
mounted escort, their own pioneer corps
and their own bands. It was the most
impressive, the most elaborately uni
formed and carefully drilled marching
club that has been seen in Canton. While
their spokesman, F. G. Hogen, was ad
dressing Major McKinley, each man
lighted a torch, and in a moment's time
1000 lights were swinging and flashing in
the street.
In the evening the Republican march
ing clubs of Massillon paid Major McKin
ley a visit and was briefly addressed by
him.
SILLOWAYE AN IMPOSTOR.
Robert T. Lincoln Expcses the Sorry Rec-
ord of the Man Who Is Fighting
McKinley.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 21. â Robert T.
Lincoln to-day declared that he believed
"this man who called himself Colonel Sil
lowaye is a simple impostor and that noth
ing he saya is entitled to the least faith or
credit." ,
Sillowaye is the man who claims to have
in Jiis possession a letter alleged to have
been written in 1890 by Major McKinley,
in which the writer is represented as op
posed to grantfng pensions to. veterans of
th c Civil War. Mr. Lincoln further said
that in 1893 and in 1894 he received marked
copies of a Boston newspaper containing
a long account of the distressed circum
stances of a Colonel William A. Siilowaye,
in which the latter's valuable military
services were vaguely referred to, as well
as his special claim oh charity for Having
saved President Lincoln from being cap
tured by rebels. One of the headlines
asked, "Why doesn't Robert Lincoln help
this man?"
In September, 1894, Mr. Lincoln received
a letter from the editor of the American
Nation, published in Boston, vouching for
Sillowaye and asking Lincoln to assist in
securing a pension for him. As Sillowaye
had claimed to have a letter from Presi
dent Lincoln thanking him for bis services
Robert Lincoln offered, if the letter was
sent for examination, to return it, together
with' a sum of money as a gift In reply
to this a rambling letter was received, in
which Sillowaye said the letter was in the
possession of his daughter and he had
been unable to get it.
"iAh' examination of the army register
shows no officer by the name of Sillow
aye," said Mr. Lincoln, "and the steamer
Brooks, on which Sillowaye claimed to
have been employed an an engineer in the
navy, was a river Doat hired by the War
Department and operated by the owner."
Continuing Mr. Lincoln said:
"Sillowaye wrote thai the saying of my
father from capture took place May 13,
1863. His statement is to the effect that
he steamer Brooks was attacked by rebe!3
May 13, 1863, down the Potomac, ana that
he in some way undescribed saved the
President from capture. On page 474 of
part 11, volume 25. of series 1, Records of
the War of the Rebellion, is found a tele
gram dated Washington, May 13, 1863,
which is addressed to Major-General
Hooker and signed by President Liucoln,
requesting General Hooker to come up
and see the President that evening, and
following that telegram in the book is the
reply of General Hooker stating that he
would come.
"From all these facts I therefore nave
no doubt whatever that this man Sillo
wnye is a simple impostor."
HANNA ANSWERS JONES' CHARGES.
Says the Accusation That Voters Are Co
erced Is an Intuit to Both Employer
and Employe.
CHICAGO, 111.. Oct 21. â Chairman
Hanna this morning gave to the press the
following:
The manifest policy of the Silver Democratic
managers in this campaign, as set forth by
their candidate for President shortly after his
nomination, has been to create the belief in
the minds of the workingmen that they were
being coerced by their employers to vote con
trary to their convictions. The chairman of
the National Committee, Hon. James K. Jones,
has emphasized this policy in a proclamation
in which he boldly eharses the employing
classes of lhe country with having entered
into a conspiracy to coerce their employes into
voting contrary to their opinions.
This is a very grave charge and it has now
assumed a form that justifies giving it some
attention. It is an insult both to employer
and employe. We do not believe that one is
despotic enough to attempt to coerce, or that
the other is so cringing as to be coerced. Em
ployes and employers are all free American
citizens, knowing their rights and capacity of
asserting and maintaining them. To coerce a
voter is a crime against the laws of the land,
and if Messrs. Bryan and Jones know of coer
cion they make themselves accomplices of the
criminals by not informing the proper authori
ties ana taking steps for prosecution.
It has been the policy of the Republican
party since its organization to protect every
citizen in the exercise of his elective fran
chise, and it wiJl still adhere to that policy.
While -we consider the charce absurd and be
lieve that American workingmen and em
ployers are too patriotic to be either coerced
or to coerce, the Republican National Commit
tee will jo anything in its power to protect
workingmen in the free and nntrammeled ex
ercise of their rights as citizeni and will
cheerfully unite with the National Democratic
Committee in any movement having that ob
ject in view.
Coercion of voters is not only an un-Ameri
can, unpatriotic and despotic usurpation of
the rights of a free ci izea, but it is a wrong
that will inevitably recoil upon its perpetrat*
ors. It is an arbitrary use of power that is in
direct conflict with the principles of our Gov
ernment. The civil compact of majority rule
means free majorities, tor whose protection
all constitutional powers should be used and
without which a political victory would be
barren of results worthy of a great party.
This committee will spare no pains to secure
to every citizen, whatever ' bis polltios,
the right to cost his vote according to his
convictions and to a&va his vote honestly
counted.
MORRISON SCORES ALTGELD.
Caustic Open Letter From the Chairman
of the Interstate Commerce
'Commission.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 21.â An open letter
has been received from Hon. William R.
Morrison, chairman of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, to Hon. Benja
min R. Burroughs of Edwardsville, 111.,
containing some caustic criticisms of Gov
ernor Altgeld's administration and his
attitude on the silver question. The letter
carries with it the conclusion that Colonel
Morrison will not vote the State Demo
cratic ticket in full, although he does not
explicitly say so. In part Colonel Morri
son says:
If beliel in the silver provision of the Chi
cago platform is the only test of merit, what
claim has the Governor on Its advocates? His
leases provide for the payment of rent in gold;
whether to htm personally or as president of a
corporation is immaterial. They show that he
believes and expects free coinage will result in
a depreciated silver dollar, and hjs utterances
for free coinage can have no higher purpose
than to delude those who do honestly believe
In It The Democratic party of the State has
only lost its regained power. It will doubtless
outlive the domination and control of Gover
nor Altg eld, Hon. H. E. Taubenecfc and Hon.
Jehu Baker, but it will more certainly survive
this leadership if as a party it can be relieved
from the scandal of laws disobeyed, oaths
broken and treasuries plundered.
The writer repeats the published charges
that Altgelrt violated his oath by borrow
ing State money, allowing the unlawful
use of State money by the deceased Treas
urer Ramsay, and by unlawfully opening
the treasury vi~ult after his death.

FURTHER ARRESTS AT LEADVILLE.
Three More Miners Charged With Murder
as a Result of th* Grand Jury's
Investigations.
LEADVILLE, Colo.. Oct. 2LâFollow
ing the arrest of Eben â¢ Costley last
night, three more miners were' arrested
this afternoon. They are: John
Geary, John Mullen and John Brennan,
while a warrant is out for another man
who has not yet been located. The ar
rests are the result of the Grand Jury's in
vestigation of the Coronado affair, ard the
men arrested are not to be admitted to
bail, as they are charged with the delib
erate murder of Jerry O'Keefe, a city firs
man, who was shot down while perform
ing his duty on the night of the Coronado
fire.
it is impossible to 1. am the evidence
that the Grand Jury has secured against
these men, bat it is supposed to be of a
sensational character. A plan is on foot
by a number of lessees here to gradually
dispense with the services of the union
men in their employ, whom they claim
are agitators. To-day tÂ«he management of
the Sedalia property discharged the entire
force of twenty union men, but resumed
operations to-night with a force of non
union workmen.
A court-martial will be held at Camp
Mclntyre to-morrow to try several impor
tant cases.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
ONE HUGE WAVE
SUNK THE ARAGO
Dashed the Vessel Onto the
Unfinished Coos Bar
Jetty.
Captain Reed Had Guided His
Charge Almost Out of
Danger.
EMPTY BOATS WASHED ASHORE
Bodies of None of the Drowned Re
coveredâEye-Witnesses Tell of
the Disaster.
MARSHFIELD, Ob., Oct 1. â Two
masts projecting a few feet above the
swell at high tide mark the spot where
the steamer Arago lies beneath six
fathoms of water, just beyond the end of
the unfinished jetty at the entrance to
Coos Bay. The vessel has not moved
since it was carried out of its course by a
huge bilJow, dashed on to the rocks, and
then lifted again and literally planted on
the crest of the bar. The decks of
the steamer have been swept clear,
and it is evident that the hatches are
broken, as a quantity of merchandise
which was stored in the lower hold ha)
drifted ashore. The beach has been
patrolled all day by the life-saving crew,
but none of the bodies of the drowned has
been recovered. The impression now ob
tains that the disaster was not due to the
negligence or incapacity of the captain or
his officers, all of whom behaved with
great heroism. No blame attaches to the
members of the life-saving crew, who
acted with promptness and bravery.
The following is a corrected list of those
lost: John Norman, passenger; It. Wal
ters, passenger; J. Sparks, passenger; E.
McGraw, passenger; George Patience, pas
senger; W. E. Brown, chief engineer; R.
Paterson, steward; F. Fernandez, cook; J.
Kruger, sailor; Harry Sander, sailor; Wil
liam Whittle, fireman; A. McDade, fire
man; E. Wall, fireman, and Ben, mess
boy.
Some trunks, valises and cases of butter
and honey have come ashore from the
wreck. The trunks are usually stowed in
the hold, and the finding of them makes
it certain that the force of the waves has
burst open the hatches. The hull is intact.
This proves thÂ« stanchnoss of the ves
sel, as she has been subjected to a terrible
buffeting from the elements.
Two of the ship's boats, badly smashed,
were found on the beach this morning.
It is thought that one of them was the
boat from which tha chief engineer and
crew were lost.
It was found in the vicinity of where
the unfortunate men were last seen alive,
making a brave fight again-it heavy odds
in the surf to righ t the boat. The boat com
ing ashore would suggest that the bodies
would also be thrown on the beach, but
there is a strong undertow along this por
tiou of the coast which carries a body
into deep water, burying the remains in
the sand, never again to be viewed by
friends or relatives in this world. This is
the general rule, and though it is hoped
there will be an exception in thi3 case
previous experience is to the contrary.
In regard to the occurrence of the disas
ter a few words explanatory of the sunken
jetty would not be amiss. The jetty was
built by sinking piles in the sand ahead of
the work. A traclc was then constructed
on the piles and rock was dumped from
cars until the embankment was of suffi
cient height to make the whole substantial.
As tbe work was advanced across the
spit and into deep water nenr the bar the
jetty was subjected to the full force of the
seas rolling in irom the ocean. Especially
was this severe during winter storms, and
while an appropriation was being ex
pended repairs on the track were con*
stantly necessary.
When the last appropriation was ex
hausted all work was discontinued, and
the portion in deep water soon showed
evidence of the ravages committed by the
breakers. Tbe piles and track were washed
away for a distance of 200 feet, leaving
nothing to show the dangerous embank
ment of rock hidden from view at all
stages of the tide.
Vessels give it as wide a berth as pos
sible, but when crossing out, owing to the
trend of the current being south, they are
obliged to hug the jetty as closely as
safety will permit to prevent drifting to
ward the south spit.
It was on the end of this sunken jetty
that the ill-fated Argo struck.
One eyewitness states that the vessel
was caught by a minature tidal wave,
carded out of her course and dashed her
onto the rock embankment. Another
wave carried her clear off the jetty into
deep water, where she rapidly tilled and
sank, going down stern foremost.
A. W. Neal of Marsh field, who was one
of the first to reach tlie scene of the wreck,
states that from the information obtained
from Captain Reed the Arago was steam
ing out over the bar. When she was
abreast of the outer end of the jetty, the
captain noticed that tbe swell and current
were setting the steamer on to the jÂ»tty.
Me immediately ordered the helm put
starboard, and she was answering her
helm nicely when an immense swell lifted
her stern and set her with terrific forca
down upon the jetty. Captain ReÂ«d be

Si ' : Â«'te^* I I fIS tt H FbtSÃ
A PERFECT BREAKFAST FOOD.'2
lieves that the piling of the jetty went
through the steamer's bottom. After
striking: and settling her bow swung
around with the swell until she was
headed in shore, and that is the position
she is now in, lying in about twenty-eight
feet of water.
The first sea that struck the steamer
after she had settled upon the jetty car
ried away all of her houses, sweeping her
deck clear.
Captain Reed says that First Officer
Warner's boat, containing Chief Engineer
Brown and six others, was lost through
the neglect of the tirst officer. It appears
that after Warner's boat had capsized and
been righted twice Warner deserted and
swam to the second officer's boat, which
was then close by. The captain says that
had Warner remained with his boat the
fives of seven persons would have un
doubtedly been saved.
To eive an idea of the size of the swell
that carried the iii-lated steamer on to the
jetty the distance it washed upon the shore
was measured by A. W. Reed of Gardiner,
who found it just seventy feet higher than
any swell that rolled in atterward, and
the tide ran in for three and a half hours
after. Captain Reed says there is not a
possibility of a doubt but that this im
mense swell was the one that lifted the
Araco and threw her with such terrific
force upon the submerged rocks of the
jetty.
The Coos Bay life-saving crew deserves
great credit for their services. They had
a four-mile puli against a very strong flood
tide, and had to cross a very lumpy, rough
bar, and arrived at the wreck after four
men had been washed from tho vessel
and one boat-load lsad been lost, but they
at once went to work to rescue Captain
Reed and his remaining passengers ana
crew.
Thi3 was accomplished by the life crew
giving them a line, and one at a time they
tied it to themselves and jumped from the
riggins into the angry sea and were pulled
aboard the lifeboat. Captain Reed was
the last man to leave his ship.
C. E. Getty lives at Rocky Point, just
opposite the Coos Bay bar. In an inter
view he says he left his home yesterday
at 8 o'clock, accompanied by his wife, in a
small boat for Empire City. They had
proceeded but a short distance when they
beard four short whistles from the tug
Columbia in the direction of the bar and
in a few minutes four more whistles from
some boat in the direction of Coos Head.
He remarked to his wife that tbe lifeboat
was needed and something must he
wrong on the bar. Just then the tug
came in and passed up the inside channel
to the Government works, v.'here she
sounded four short whistles.
Mr. Getty pulled as hard as he could to
catch her, but she c.mie down again and
passed below him and returned to Empire
City, after blowing four more whistles as
Bhe passed the life-saving station. Mr.
Getty was by this time in the channel
above the Government works, when he saw
Morton L. Tower running down the beach.
They went ashore and Tower told them
that the steamer Ara^o was lost and that
the life-saving crew had been notified and
were on their way to the scene of the wreck
against a very strong flood tide. Getty
left bis boat and walked down with Tower
to the Government works, and they got a
oandcar ready to go to the end of the jetty.
By this time J. G. Haynes, in charge of
the iile-saving crew, had joined them. He
with two others, Getty ana Tower, boarded
the car and went out on to the jetty until
the location of the steamer couid be as
certained. Than they returned to the
Government . works and the life-saving
crew started around tbe jetty and over
the bar for the scene of the wreck. Getty
and Tower loaded the car with life-buoys
and lines and returned down the jetty "as
far as they could with safety. They could
Â«cc the wreck very plainly, and could see
eight men in the rigging and two boats,
one near the stern, with ten or twelve
men in it and apparently free of water.
The other, near the shore and abreast
of where Getty and Tower were standing
on the jetty, had live men in it and was
nearly mil of water, but right side up.
After passing thronsh several heavy
seas all right, with one man bailing and
two rowing, the boat was capsized and the
men washed away from her, but all got
back again. Then a succession of heavy
seas came and the boat was finally seen
empty.
They looked for the other boat, which
they watched from time to time, and saw
that she was working to the south in line
with the jetty. She was going through a
very rough sea and in raising on the top
of a wave she seemed to stand straight oa
end.
"We could see only a part of the steer
ing-oar standing straight up iv the air,"
he continued. "We were sure that every
sea that struck her would engulf her, but
Fhe stood it through one after another.
They were running mountain high and
most of the time we could not see the boat
at all. Too much credit cannot be given
Second Officer Banks, who was in charge
of this boat, for his heroic efforts alone
caved the lives of all the occupants. "
When satisfied that the boat would
make shore safely Mr. Getty, unable to do
anything on the jetty, went back on the
car and went on the beach as near to the
â¢wreck as possible in hopes that some of
the first orficer's boat crew would âash
ashore. The boat came ashore but it was
empty. Two other boats were ashore at
the same place, one of them high up on
the beach. He looked for tracks but found
none. The beach was by this time strewn
with wreckage. Mr. Getty and Mart Ro
sell searched the beach north and south
as far as there was any wreckage, but
could not find tbe bodies. They were the
only ones on the beach until the second
â¦h. â¦â Z u?a Bay where the whaleback Wetmore met her fate some years ago, and where the steamer Arago went ashore Tuesday morning, is one of
the most difficult .and dangerous entrances on the Pacific Coast. The bar at the mouth varies in depth from nine to nineteen feet, according to the season, and is
ting that the locations of the several buoys marking its. limits aie not put down on the Government charts. Vessels entering the harbor eenerally approach from
Â» northwest keeping a narrow open api.ee in sight between Guano Rock and Coos Head until past the former, when they steer more to the south and then to
the north-northeast in the channel just east of the north spit. Going oat, the same course is followed. The long stretch of shallow running down from the north
(pit toward Coos Head makes the passage difficult at any time, and very dangerous in rough or fo K gy weather. The north jetty when completed will modify these
conditions very much. It has now been finished well out to Guano Rock and partially so a little beyond. It was on this unfinished tto ArJTww 'drive"
by the breakers and lost. The vessel is said by those well acquainted with her to have been very reluctant to obey her helm.
officer's boat landed in the bay, and the
men came running across the beach
almost frantic looking for their shipmates.
From them Mr. Getty learned that the
first mate and two sailors had left the
swamped boat and swum to the second
officer's boat.
While on the jetty Mr. Getty saw the
life-saving crew making heroic efforts to
pull over a very rough bar and against a
heavy flood tide. They were nearly three
hours in reaching tho "wreck, whereas bad
the tug taken them in tow instead of going
up the bay they would have reached the
wreck in less than half that time and the
five men Getty witnessed drowning would
probably been rescued. But for some
reason the tug steamed to Empire City
and did not return in time to be of any
assistance to tho life-savin? crew.
Mr. Getty picked up a Wells-Fargo box
floating in the bay and turned it over to
the steamer's agent at Empire City.
The Arago was entirely under water
except her masts when Mr. Getty arrived.
The bar was breaking heavily and while
quite hazy in the bay it was clear outside.
The bar is very rough to-day and tho
steamer Homer was unable to cross out.
Most of the survivors of the wreck will go
to San Francisco on the Homer.
WARNING HAD BEE N GIFEN.
Lighthouse Inspector Merrill Knew- of
the Dangerous Situation.
The following letter is self-explanatory:
Obegon Coal and Navigation Company, (
San Francisco, Cal., Oct. 10, 1896. j
Lieutenant-Commander John C. Merrill, Light
house Inspector. x Portland, Dear Sir: As
you are doubtless aware, the superstructure at
the outer end of the Coos Bay jetty has been
carried' away for some .months. This leaves
the point without any safeguard to navigation
and In foggy weatner vessels are liable to get
on to the rocks at the end of the jetty before
they can see the superstructure,* a distance of
something over 200 feet. Besides, we under
stand the channel is cutting around to the
northward now, as it did some two years ago,
when it was necessary to go within forty or
fifty feet of the outer end bi the jetty. â  '
' This' is dangerously close unless there is
some buoy or prominent object there to notify
navigators oi the danger.
We would, therefore, ask that you kindly in
vestigate the matter |as nearly as possible,'
with the view of placing a buoy there. Kindly
favor us with reply and oblige, yours truly,;
Goodall, Perkins & Co.
The reply was:
Just as soon as one of the tenders is avail
able she will be sent south, and if the buoy
asked for is found to be necessary one will be
placed there. * ; John P. Merrill,
Lieutenant-Commander United States Navy,
Inspector Thirteenth Lighthouse District
"It simply amounts to this," said Ed
win Goodall yesterday: '"We considered
the channel dangerous and so informed
the Lighthouse Board. When the
200 feet of the wharf was washed away a
shoal formed to the south, and instead of
passing straight out all vessels had to make
a swing to the north. In doing so they had
to pass very close to the jetty, and on
every occasion the captain ran a great
risk. Hence our letter to the lighthouse
inspector."
A pathetic incident in connection with
the wreck of the steamer Arago took place
in this City yesterday morning. Margaret
Barns, 5 Elizabeth street, a niece of Wil
liam Whittle, , the fireman who was
drowned, was so excited over the news of
the wreck that she went downtown to await
the issue of the morning papers. B She was
accompanied by a lady friend. She pur
chased a paper from a newsboy on Market
street and when she saw her uncle's name
in the list of dead she went into a violent
lit of hysterics. She was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital in the patrol wagon and
it was several hours before she recovered.
CAPTURED A FILIBUSTER.
rie Steamer Daunt/ess and Her Tender
Overhauled by the Revenue
Cruiser Raleigh.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. 2Lâ Off
New Smyrna bar, this morning, the
United States cruiser Raleigh captured
the filibustering steamer Dauntless and
her tender, the S. L. Mabey. The Daunt
less was caught at 6 o'ciock-and the Mabey
later. The latter steamer was putting out
to sea with coal and supplies for the
Dauntless' when the Raleieh rired a blank
cartridge for her to stop.
The Mabey turned about and tried to
escape, whereupon tbe Raleigh fired a
solio shot across her bows, and the tug
hove to. An officer was pnt in charge of
the Mabey and the Dauntless was brought
to St. Johns bar and now lies inside, in
charge of officers of the Raleigh. Cubans
here are greatly excited, but claim that
the Dauntless had no arms nor men on
board. In chasing and capturing the
Dauntless tbe Raleigh used her guns sev
eral times, and the little filibuster came
near being sunk.

THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1869.
POPULARITY OF
BISHOP KEANE
Directors of the Catholic
University Hold a
Session.
Decline to Accept the Deposed
Rector's Resignation From
the Board.
THE VACANT RECTORSHIP.
Three Names Agreed Upon at the
Meeting for Presentation to
the Pope.
WASHINGTON, D. OL, Oct. 21. â Al.
though the proceedings of the board of
directors of the Catholic University, which
beeun its session to-day, were hedged
about with secrecy, some portion of the
business transacted has become known.
It was anticipated that tbe vacancies in
the board to be filled to-day would be
filled by the selection of churchmen not in
sympathy with Archbishop Ireland and
Bishop Keane. The contrar}', however,
proved to be the case. The resignation of
Bishop K^ane as a member of the board,
tendered at the same time he resigned the
rectorship of the university at the request
of ihe Pope, was declined, and this action
was of course largely due to the high
regard in which the deposed rector is
held.
Another vicancy bad been caused in
the board by thedeath of Bishop Martin of
St. Cloud, who during his life was a strong
adherent of the party opposed to Arch
bisLop Ireland, and it was supposed his
successor would hold similar views.
Archbishop Riordan of San Francisco, a
friend of Archbishop Ireland, was elected,
and this, It is claimed, places a strong and
influential member of the American party
in the board.
The meeting was presided over by Car
dinal Gibbons as chancellor of the uni
versity. AmoDi the other directors
present were: Archbishop Corri^an of
New York, Archbishop Williams of Bos
ton, Archbishop Ryan of Philadelphia,
Archbishop Ireland of St. Paul, Arch
bishop Chapelie of Santa Fe, Bishop Macs
of Covington, Bishop Foley of Detroit,
Bishop Horstman of Cleveland, Bishop
Farley, auxiliary Bishop of New York ;
Rev. Father Thomas S. Lee, pastor of St.
Matthew's Church of this city, mid Rev.
Thomas Â£. Waggeman, also of Washing
ton.
There were present also as ex-officio
members of the board, who were not en
titled to a vote on any question presented:
Archbishops Elder of Cincinnati, Riordan
of San Francisco, Kain of St. Louis, Gross
of Oregon and Feehan of Chicago.
Although trie fact could not be ascer
tained with positiveness, there is trood
reason to believe that three names were
agreed upon before the meeting adjourned
to-day for presentation to the Pope as
successor to Bishop Keane. but thoae pres
ent refused absolutely to discuss the mat
ter. Among the churchmen so far named
in connection with the rectorship are the
following : Father Connata, head of the
Catholic Summer School of Philosophy at
Statesbury, N. V. ; Father Brannon of St.
Agnes Church, New York; the Very Rev.
Howitz of the Paulist congregation of
New York; Dr. Edward P. Allen, head of
St. Mary's Seminary, Emmetsbure, Md. ;
Bishop Spalding of Peora, III.; Bishop
Horstman of Cleveland and Bishop
Becker of Georgia; Archbishop Chappelle
of Santa Fe and D:. Carrigan, acting
rector of the university.
The board held a special meeting at 4
o'c'ock to receive the endowment fund of
$50,000 raised by the Ancient Order of
Hibernians for tbe establishment of a
chair of Gaelic literature in the university.
The presentation was made in McMahon
Hall, which was decorated with the Papal
colors, yellow and white, mingled with
the red, white and blue. A committee of
tbe Ancient Order of Hibernians occupied
seats on the platform. P. J. O'Connor of
Savannah, president of the order, made the
presentation speech, and addresses on be
half of the order were also made by M. E.
My i here of Philadelphia and Hon. J. C.
Weadock of Bay City, Mich.
Cardinal Gibbons accepted the donation
on behalf of the university. He said that
for many years priests and laymen of
Gaelic origin had made isolated attempts
to secure on American soil the teaching of
the language of their ancestors. Review
ing the wont of the Hibernians, the Car
dinal paid a fitting tribute to their gener
osity, many of whom were not, he said,
over rich, but who helped to bear the ma
terial burdens of the church in all the
States and Territories. The donation re- I
vealed a spirit of profound confidence, a
firm conviction that the solemn invitation
of Leo XIII to contribute to the support
of the university, and the controi exercised
over the entire' work of the American
episcopate was ample guarantee that tbe
will of the donors would never be frus
trated nor the spirit of the gift violated.
The founding of this chair was, the Car
dinal continued, moved by sentiments of
gratitude and veneration for the past ser
vices of the Gaelic tongue; it had no in
tention of adopting the Gaelic as a spoken
tongue. The great tongue of this country,
by a marvelous dispensation of divine
providence, is the English tongue. As
loyal and affectionate sons of this mighty
commonwealth the members of the order
cliue not only to the fundamental com
pacts of the Nation and the States, to the
common institutions and also to the spirit
of this country, but likewise to its Na
tional tongue and literature.
The Cardinal devoted a considerable
portion of his remarks to the past history
of the Gaelic tonsrue and literature and
the honored place they held in the es
teem ot all modern philologists and re
ferred to it as being during the last half
century the object of profound research.
The board of directors later gave out
the following list of names they had
selected to be forwarded to Rome from
which it is expected the Holy Father will
select one for the rectorship of the Catho
lic university: Rev. T. J. Conaty, D.D.,
of Worcester, Mass.; Very Rev. J. A.
Mooney of New York and Rev. Daniel
Riordan of Chicago.
The board followed strictly the letter of
the constitution, which says that the rec
tor must be a priest. Bishop Keane was
elected to his position before the constitu
tion was approved or enforced. It was
enacted that the rector will be elected
hereafter for a term of six years. Many
names were presented by the directors
viva voco. When it came to the selection
by ballot Very Rev. Dr. Garrigan, acting
rector, positively withdrew his name from
the list.
The resignation of Professor Perrier of
the thair of canon law was accepted.
FRANCE AND RUSSIA.
Outlines of the Military Convention Be
tween the Two Countries Formed
Six Years Ago.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 21.â The Daily
Chronicle in to-morrow's issue will claim
to have obtained the outlines of the much
debated treaty of alliance between France
and Russia, which was germinated in tie
military convention of 1890. The treaty
was signed in December, 1893, M. Casimir-
Perier and M. de Giers, Russian Foreign
Minister, being chiefly concerned.
The treaty, tne Chronicle will say, is
simply a military convention, with special
relation to the balance of power created
by the Austro-German alliance, and lapses
when the latter terminates. It is purely
defensive, and, therefore, could not be
used to aid in the recovery by France of
the Reichsland, and is directed only
against such attacks on the part of Ger
many as was meditated by Prince Bis
marck in 1875. Codicils have been added
to the treaty dealing with the unfounded
scare over the reported intention of Great
Britain to intervene in Morocco and the
China- Japan war.

MURDERED BY DYNAMITE
Bomb Placsd Under the Desk of
a Business Man at Yonkers,
New York.
Believed to Have Baen the Work of
Anarchists, Who Killed the
I Wrong Man.
YONKERS, N. V., Oct. 21.â Hamlin J.
Andrus, secretary of the Arlington Chemi
cal Company, was murdered to-day in his
office by some unknown miscreant who
chose a dynamite bomb as his weapon.
The work looked like that of a mad man
or an anarchist, and when all the evi
dence that could be gathered to-day was
sifted it looked as if the bomb had not
been intended lor the victim which it
reaehen, but for his brother, John E.
Andrus, the wealthiest man in Yonkers
and president of the concern.
The dynamite bomb is supposed to have
been placed on a wastepaper box under
the desk which Mr. Andrus used as a
footstool. Mr. Andrus bad not an enemy
in the world as fur as known.
His brother, John E. Andrus, is wealthy
and has enemies. The family suspect no
one. Several employes have been dis
charged recently for lack of work, but
they showed no ill feeling. The police be
lieve it to have been the work of anarch
ists.
J. E. Andrus firmly believes that it was
a case, of assassination. He thinks the
bomb was intended for both his brother
and himself.
He says that since the young Americans
have been driven out of the carpet works
in Yonkers their places have been taken
by foreigners who are anarchistic in their
leanings.
Twice within the last month he has
heard menacing threats. Monday, when
he was walking on Greenwich street in
this city, he was accosted by a roughly
dressed man, who said, "If you had your
junt deserts youkl be made to give up one
third of your money x'o us."
"Another time." continued Mr. Andrus,
"as W. F. Cockran, who owns the carpet
factory next to my place, was getting into
his carriage, I overheard a man say:
" 'It's our blood that enables the likes of
him to ride in carriages. We work our
Jives out and starve while he has every
thing. 1 "

BULLS AND BEARS
IN THE WHEAT PIT
The Former Worsted After
a Brief but Exciting
Conflict.
December Options Fall Several
Points in the Chicago
Market.
A RESULT OF FOREIGN APATHY
To San Francisco Lukewarmness Is
Attributed the Check of
the Boom.
CHICAGO, 111.. Oct. 21.â A short-lived
flurry, in which the bulls came out second
best, took place at the opening of the
wheat market to-day, the excitement at
tendant upon the trade running, quite
high. When the market opened a rapid
sliding was inaugurated, December options
dropping to 76% cents. The decline was
clparly the result of foreign indifference.
Liverpool was 2d higher, but that advance
was not considered in keeping with the
anxiety said to exist abroad, and impor
tance was also attached to the apparent
lukewarmness of San Francisco, where the
boom appeared to have been checked. At
the end of the first half hour of the session
there was farther weakness, which assailed
prices, and December fell off to 76)4 cents,
where it rested, 1% cents under yester
day's close. Afterward there was a drop
to 75J^ cents, and on the curb a further
decline to 74% cents ensued.
JONES ATTEMPIS TO EXPLAIN.
Hays the Advance in Wheat Proves the
'Jheories of the Silver Men,
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 21.â Senator Jones,
chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, was interviewed to-day by a re
porter for the United Associated Presses re
garding the pronunciamento of Chairman
Babcock of the Republican Congressional
Committee, in whicn : Mr.Babcock insists
that the recent rise in the price of the
bushel of wheat, while the price of the
ounce of silver has declined, indicates
that the claims of .the silver men that the
price of wheat depends on the price of the
ounce of silver are unfounded. The Sena
tor said :
The advance In- the 'price of . the bushel of
wheat proves rather than disproves the theo
ries -of , the silver men. S Our contention has
been that the wheat of I India competed with
our American wheat in the Liverpool markets;
that the Liverpool merchant could in normal
times buy in India at any time during the past
twenty-three years a bushel oi wheat for about
an ounce of silver. '
* When the ounce of silver was worth $1 29 in
gold in 1873 this meant that the bushel of
wheat was worth about that in gold, but, al
though the India wheat .farmer, has always
been willing to take an " ounce of silver for a
bushel of wheat/ the ounce of silver has fallen
in value, owing to its demonetization and dis
use, and consequently as gold value of the
ounce of silver declined the gold value of the
bushel of wheat declined, f and the American
farmer has been compelled to receive the gold
equivalent of the â  ounce of Â»> silver * for :> his
bushel of wheat. This ' meant a gradual de
cline la the price from ; about $1 29 or $1 30 a
bushel in 1873 to 60 or 65 cents in 1893. :
The real cause, therefore, of . the ' decline *in
the gold value of our wheat was largely
in the . competition |of . : India. This competi
tion has been recently; done ; away- with by
reason of the failure of the wheat crop in India
and hence the price of American wheat, de
prived of : this competition, has steadily ad
vanced, s Should, 5 - however, I the normal crops
be restored in India, the old effect of the fall
in silver will be felt in wheat end the price . of
the American wheat iin gold will again be
measured by the gold : price of the ounce of
silver if the present financial system Is main
tained. â¢
Were ; India in a - position to 'export wheat
she would import silver In exchange, and her
demand for silver would strengthen the silver
market. -.As it is she imports wheat, dimin
ishes her . favorable ; balance of trade i and
thereby reduced her demand for silver, and
the price of sliver falls.
NO COR Shit AND NO POLITICS.
President Bill of the threat A'orthern
Veniea Wild Humor*.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Oct. 21.â The atten
tion of James J. Hill, president of the
Great Northern Railway, was called to a
sensational story printed in a New York
paper yesterday morning to the effect that
he, Charles A. Pillsbury and other men of
wealth had entered into a gigantic combi
nation to corner wheat. Mr. Hill charac
terized the story as wholly absurd. He
said reports from the various stations
along the Great Northern Road indicated
that there was far less wheat in the ele
vators than at any time for tbe last three
years, and that he bad no doubt that the
grain was moving to market with unusual
speed, owing to tbe great rise in the price
of wheat since last Friday.
Grain was even moving in large quan
tities from as far west as Idaho and Wash
ington, some of it going directly to Port
land, thence to be shipped to India. Mr.
Hill rejects the idea that there is any
politics in the rise in the price of wheat.
Both Mr. Washburn and Mr. Pillsbury
last evening denied that they had any in
terest whatever in a wheat corner.
FOSEION MARKETS FIRM.
Short Crop in France May Cause Further
Advance in Wheat.
ANTWERP, Oct. 21.â The wheat market
to-day was firm, and prices were main
tained fully on a parity with the late Pans
rates. Millers were more disposed to pur
chase, and an advance of 7)Â£d to lOd was
established.
PARIS, France, Oct. 21.â The French
provincial grain markets to-day were
firm, the opinion gaining ground that a
further advance was probable in France,
as the French wheat crop wouid nut be
sufficient for home consumption and that
the country would be compelled to import
wheat freely.
ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, Oct. 21âA
firm tone prevailed to-day in the wheat
market in sympathy with the feeling in
other grain centers.
Ihe London Gr.iin Market Firm.
LONDON, Exo., Oct. 21.â 1n the grain
market to-day there was less activity than
there has been, but there was no abate
ment in the firmness of its' tone and the
tendency was higher. Foreign wheats
were 6d dearer and sold firm.
THE CASTLES IS RETIREMENT.
Futile Efforts of the Reporter* to , Obtain
â  _ ' l_."l ""'' Their ; Address.*; \_ '.-â¢''_
Â LONDON, Esq.', Oct. 21.â Solicitor Ab
rahams of the United States Embassy was
besieged . this morning by report
ers who were endeavoring to ob
tain the address of Mr. and Mrs.
W. A. Castle of San Francisco, who were
com milted for trial yesterday on a charge
of shoplifting and liberated on Â£40,000 bail
pending the cominc up of their case in the
Clerkenwell sessions on November 2.
Mr. Abrahams refused to disclose the
whereabouts of the Castles, though he
admitted they were in London. The soli
citor said that Mr. Castle was absolutely
innocent and that justice required his
acquittal. Mrs. Castle, he said, was very
much broken down by her ordeal.
Her defense, Mr. Abrahams intimated,
would bs mental irresponsibility, owing to
her sufferings from troubles peculiar to
females. He did not appear to be over
confident of the success of the defense in
securing Mrs. Castle's acquittal.
ANOTHER BATTLE IN CUBA.
Rebels Said to Have Been Defeated With
Heavy Loss â Meeting of the Spanish
Cabinet.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 21.â A report has
been received from Colonel Vintos stating
that the force under his command en
countered a band of insurgents under
Aguirre and other rebel leaders near
Jaruco, in the Havana province. Tne
rebels were strongly entrenched and made
a good defense, but were finally obliged to
retire by a bayonet charge by the Span
iards, made in the face of a heavy fire of
artillery. The insurgents retreated to the
Bonillaand Peru hills, whither they were
pursued by the Government troops and
dispersed completely.
The Spaniards lost two killed, two cap
tains and fourteen privates wounded
seriously and nineteen privates slightly.
The loss of the rebels is believed to be
heavy, but is not officially known, as all of
their dead and wounded were carried away
by tne survivors.
Angel Cowley Hurtado was shot at
Matanzas to-day for the crime of rebellion.
MADRID, SrAiN, Oct. 21.â At a meeting
of the Cabinet tc-day the claim of thÂ«
United States Government for damages
for losses sustained by Americans in con
sequence of the enforcement of Captain-
General Weyler's decree prohibiting the
export of tobacco from Cuba was consid
ered, but no decision in the matter was
reached. The Cabinet adopted a resolu
tion to send General Polivoeja, who some
time ago was mentioned as Weyler's
possible successor in the captain-general
ship cf Cuba, and Brk-adier-General Sap
pino to the Philippine Islands to assist
Captain-General Bianco in the work of

A DELIBERATE SUICIDE.
Absconding Banker Shoots Him
self in the Fredericksburg
Cemetery.
Carefully Prepared Instructions as to
the Disposition ot His Body
and Effects.
FREDERICKBBURG, Va., Oct. 21.â
W. T. Rambusch, an absconding banker
from Wisconsin, killed himself' here last
nijjht. Rambusch came here a wees ajro.
He registered at the hotel as C. T. Ander
son. He shot himself in the National
Cemetery.
It was evident from papers found on
Rambusch's person that he had contem
plated suicide, but was hastened in com
mitting the deed as soon as he did by the
appearance in yesterday evening's papers
of a cut of himself and a detailed account
of his crimes. He addressed a letter to
th 6 Presbyterian minister asking that he
offer a prayer over his grave and beg
heaven's protection to his wife and daugh
ter. He requested that his remains be
buried here and that parties named by
him be wired to come here and identify
the body, that his family would have no
trouble in securing the insurance money.
He claimed when he came here that he
was in ill health and had been ordered by
his physician to seek rest and recreation,
and as be had not visiteti the battle-fields
of this section since he participated in the
stormy scenes of the war l;e had come to
this piace. He had no effects with him
save a small hand-satchel in which were a
change of underwear and a few other
small belonpings and the $125 found on
his person. This he requested to be used
in settling his unpaid hotel bill and fu
neral expenses.
He was very methodical in all he did,
and went to his death with a deliberation
and calmness that only a man of iron
nerve could command. Those who came
in contact with nim were impressed with
his intelligence and dignified manner.
The verdict of the Coroner's jury was mur
der by his own hand.
Telegrams have been received from
friends in Wisconsin and New York, but
as they are somewhat conflicting the
senders have been summoned here in per
son. The letters to his wife and John
Curtis of Centerville, his cousin, were at
his request forwarded unopened. In
neither of his communications to parties
here did he refer to the grave charges
made against himself in the papers, doubt
less thinking that the disclosure of his
identity would be sufficient to publish his
wrongdoing far and wide.

ANDERSON'S GREAT TURNOUT.
Party Feeling So High at Muncie That
a Confl ct Is Narrowly
Averted.
FORT WAYNE, Ind., Oct. 21.â The
orange insignia of the Republican cause
was met by William J. Bryan all through
Indiana from Richmond to Fort Wayne
to-day, but he had large audiences at
every place where a stop was made, and
created a great amount of enthusiasm.
That, stronghold of Republicanism, Rich
mond, gave him his welcome to the
Hoosier State, and prepared him in a
measure for the "yellow _ fever," as he
calls it. which naturally might be expected
to exist in the section through which he
passed, which has long been noted for its
allegiance to the principles of the Repub
lican party. However, Mr. Bryan had
every reason to be gratified with the de
monstration In his honor, for the outpour
ings of people were remarkable in point
of numbers and the enthusiasm shown.
Between midnight and the time he con
cluded his second speech at Fort Wayne
this evening, Mr. Bryan spoke to eighteen
audiences. Two speeches were made at
Richmond, three more at Fort Wayne and
one each at C.yde, Tiffin and Bradford
Junction, all in Ohio and the Indiana
towns of Cambridge City, Rushville, New
castle, Muncie, Anderson, Alexandria,
mitville, Fairmount, Marion and Bluffton.
One remarkable feature of the day was
the unprecedented gathering, for that
place, at the meeting he addressed at
Anderson, which was composed of about
25,000 people. The Indiana State com
mittee does not intend to make Mr. Bryan
work so hard as he did. in Ohio, and be
tween Fort Wayne and Terre Haute, the
6cope of his labors to-morrow, he is
scheduled to speak at sixteen points only.
Mr. Bryan spent the night at Fort
Wayne, and will start out on the second
and last day of his Indiana campaign at
4:30 to-morrow morning.
A magnificent demonstration was given
Mr. Jsryan at Kushville. It was hard to
estimate the crowd gathered in a big open
field there, because of the presence of
dozens of carriages and wagons forming a
deep fringe about the immense throng
solidly massed around the speaker's
stand, "but between 12,000 and 15,000 is a
reasonable calculation. Mr. Bryan's re
marks-were vigorously cheered. He
brought out no new "features in his
spleen, iv:
Newcastle was reached more than an
hour behind schedule time, and furnished
an audience of between four ana â  five
thousand, to' which Mr. Bryan made a lew
remarks. As at Richmond and several
paces in Ohio, daring yesterday's trip, he
was con ronted by many McKioley badges,
but those who wore pictures of Bryan ou
their bats and Rryan ribbon? on their
coats seemingly outnumbered their oppos
ing fellow-townsmen. ;
Mr. Bryan referred to the trip General
Harrison is making through Indiana, and
added these words:
*Ex-Presldent, Harrison was elected to the
Presidency on a platform that denounced Mr.
Cleveland's, administration, on the ground
that he had tried to demonetize silver, but the
ex-President to-day is stumping this State try
ing to get the Republicans to indorse Mr.
Cleveland's financial policy. His policy dur
ing the last administration was worse on the
money question than during the. first admin
istration, but such n change has come over the
Jle.puMir.an leaders that they want us to-day
to submit to a policy which they denounce.!
eight years ago.
But I say to yon, my friends, * that the only
reason for this change is that the money in
fluences wrote the Republican platform' and
'influences are trying to make the Amer
ican people bend to a foreign yoke and pay
..tribute to a loreign despotism.' ,
Party feeling was running high in Mun
cie when Mr. Bryan arrived there. Wil
liam I). .By n urn had an engagement to
speak late in the day and the friend 3of
the well-known gold leader had dis
tributed with a lavish hand thousands of
orange-colored badges inscribed with the
names of McKinley. and Hobart and
"sound money, protection and prosper
ity." Most of the Bryan adherents, to the
number of 6000. were gathered at the ball
park awaiting his coming, but the streets
were .crowded with McKinley people,
male and female. There had been rumors
that questions would be asked Mr. Bryan
at the park, and that trouble was feared
between opposing factions was evident
from the fact that hundreds of men,
whether wearing gold or silver badge?,
were around with big clubs.
A howling crowd of Bryan enthusiasts
lollowed close behind 'he candidate's four
in-hand as it was driven through the
streets, followed by another contingent
cheering lor McKiiiley. There was much
disorder and the several contingents of
seventeen little girls, symbolical in their
dress of the money ratio Mr. Bryan wants
to establish, were lost in the confusion.'
But though the yellow was predominant
in the streets th* 0000 people at the ba 1
park left no doubt as to their sympathies
by the inscriptions they bore and by their
hearty cheers. A solid mass, every man
having the name of Bryan tinned to his
hat, faced ihe nominee as he began his
address, in the course of which he said:
When I find a man who denounces agitation
and tries to stop public discussion I find a man
â who would ' feel mora at home under a
monarchy -than he does in a republic where
laws are made by the people. [Cheers.].- it is
because they know that the gold standard will
not stand the test of discussion and because
they know that the errors whien lie behind it
and the fallacies which Â«re inthe arguments
that support it will be discovered by public
discussion they condemn pubic discussion,
and attempt to quiet, the people and compel
them to accept without protest. a financial
policy which Wall street demands that' the
American people shall submit to. [Cheers.] â¢
WOULD BE A POPULIST VICTORY.
Colonel Norton Says the . People's Party
Will Receive the Credit it Bryan
Wins.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 21.â Colonel
h. F. Norton of Illinois, who was the can
didate of the middle-of-the-road Populists
at the St. Louis convention, has written to
Chairman Butler a commication which
says in part:
However much Populists nay have differed
at Si. Louis as to the correct policy to adopt ;
however; much some of us jnny believe that
mistake* were ' made, under, existing circum
stances *^ ere Is only one course to pursue and
that is to loyally and earnestly. support Mr.
isryanâ so much for the sake of : ; elevating
Dim to the Presidency as for the purpose of
tiqieatiriK wnat . may ;be appropriately ana
most expressively termed Mark Hauna Repub
licanism. Although some of us regret certain
fusion arrangements which have been I made,
v v a notabie fact that no other man in the \
The Competitive Drill of the Grand Cantons, I. O. O. R, at the Armory, Santa Cruz, October 2\ f Witnessed by 3500 People.
United States is so much troubled about it as
tlie manager of the Republican party.
I never realized before how Republicans
have always "respected" and "honored" the
Populist party till it fused with the Dem
ocratic party. If any consolation is needed,
however, for this loss of Republican esteem, it
may be found in the fact that Messrs. Cleve
land, Carlisle and Palmer have become tne
legatees thereof.
Our political a'tiies in this campaign may
not have treated us as fairly and justly as they
ought in the matter of representation of Vice-
Presidential electors, and this seems to be the
chief cause of complaint, for I have yet to
meet with a Popuiist who does nol admit that
Bryan is the ablest and most fearless champion
of reform principles that the reformers them
selves have chosen in the last twenty years.
His an event in history io find a man backed
by more than 4,000,000 votes who has the
patriotism and courage to stand up faced by
the combined find battle-worn fla? of reform
that the old guard has held aloft bravely and
heroically all these long years, and anxious
solicitude as to the outcome may be excus
able.
But let us not be unnecessarily alarmed
about the future of the reform movement. H
has passed the danger point. It is capable of
taking care of itseh under any und all circum
stances. Traitors cannot betray _it; time
servers cannot sell it out; injudicious friends
cannot destroy it; defeat cannot demoralize
it ; its opponents, however powerf uland crafiy,
cannot crush it; even the gates of hell cannot
prevail against it.
For twenty years, although subjected to all
the dangerous t>itfalls, perils and quicksands
incident to the development of a new party, it
has grown to be the greatest factor in the
arena of American politics to-day. And if
elected 1 beiieye that Mr. Bryan will not be
slow to recognize this facv and that, he will
soon learn to rely upon the counsel and sup
port of the new party which has revolution
ized the politics of the country, forced
to the front new and vital issues and mÂ«de
it possible for the people, instend oi oflice
seeking politicians, to place a champion of
Drogressive ideas at the head ot the Govern
ment. I believe that he will apnreciate the
fact that we have placed in ihe hoilow of
his hand, not only the selfish hopes and patri
otic aspirations ot the People's party, but the
most sacred cause that was ever intrusted to
living man, and that he will not bevray the
trust.
In conclusion let me say that If my twenty
years of work eniitles me to the confidence of
my co-work-era, let me ask them to lay aside
every other consideration and help Mr. Bryan
ânot lor his sake, but the cake ol the princi
ples which we all hold sacred and jiear. If
success is achieved '.he Populist party can
never be denied the glory ot the victory. If
defeat awnira us and our standard-bearer falls,
let there be no Populist arrows found in his
breast or in his back. Let the responsibility
rest on other shoulders than our own.
CERTAIN FOR McKINLEY.
Good -VtrÂ» From the ttnkotas, Kansas
and Nebraska.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 2LâCommittee
man Payne said to-day that the mail re
ceived at Republican National headquar
ters from the Dakotas, Nebraska and
Kansas contained reports ' which proved
beyond doubt in his mind that those
States would give substantial majorities
for McKinley, showing that he was right
in adding those States to the sure column
and thus sustaining Chairman Hanna's
claim of over 300 electoral votes. -
Senator Allison came in from.lowa on
his way to Indiana. He spoke in Indian
apolis to-night, and goes to Jacksonville,
111., to-morrow. The Senator will deliver
an address at Minneapolis on October 29,'
and will close the campaign in- his own
State. ? His \ confidence in a bis- majority
for McKinley in lowa is unshaken. .'
Mr. Hanna, when he read the letter
claimed to have = been written General
Welles by Major McKinley in regard *to
the Sigourney pension, declared it to be 1 a
forgery. He said the letter carried on its
face the fact that 'it was- not -genuine,
because it was directly opposed to McKin
l-ey'a record on pensions during his public
career. -â¢ Besides, it was evident that the
letter was ; never written ; by t the major,
because at the time it was alleged to have
been sent. Major McKinley signed himself
William McKinley,. Jr., while the alleged
letter omitted the junior.

GENERAL HARRISON'S WORK.
The Ex- President Addresses Enthusiastic
Multitudes at Many Places in
His Own State.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind , Onr. 21.âGen
eral Harrison, upon his arrival home this
evening, seemed but little fatigued and
was in the best of spirits. The Republican
leaders who accompanied him on his In
diana tour expressed gratification over the
day's journey. Larce crowds greeted the
ex-President all along the route. His spe
cial train went into New AlDany at ' 9
o'clock this morning from Evansville
amid the tremendous tooting of whistles
and firing of cannon.
The street leading from the Air Line to
Scribner's Park was packed with people
to such a degree that it was difficult to
force f. way through it for the carriages of
the distinguished speaker and party.
When he appeared from the rear of his
car he was greeted with loud cheers. It
took time to get him to Lba park, and
more time alter he had arrived there to
force a passage through the dense throng
to the stand. The crowd had been con
tributed to by Louisville and points north
ana was estimated at from 20,000 to 25 000
people. General Harrison addressed him
self first to the worKingmen, of ' whom the
crowd was largely composed, explaining
that they were the first to suffer from a
depreciated dollar, and they had already
suffered enough from low tariff.
After the speech General Harrison was
driven to the Monon station, where his car
was awaiting him.
The next stop was at the little town of
Borden, where something over 1000 farm
ers had gathered, and, as at all country
stops, there was a profusion of gold in the
decorations and uniforms.
At Salem, the county-seat of the sparsely ,
settled agricultural county of Washington,
a stop of nearly an hour was made. The
gathering surpassed anything Salem has
ever seen, estimated at about 10.000, who
had gathered irom Washington and adja
cent counties, escorted by a company of
cavalry.
At Bedford, the great center of the In
diana stone industry, was the most re
markaole demonstration that was met
during the day. There was not less than
25,000 people on hand. The crowd was so
great that it was almost impossible to talk
to it, and not a quarter of the people
could get within heuring distance.
At Groer.castle, the last stop scheduled
for tho day, about 5000 people were found
wedsied in the Bpace about the depot, and
General Harrison spoke from the rear
platform. It was already dark and nis
speech was very brief.
The party took supper in the car after
leaving there, ana the run to Indianapolis
was made without further incident.
THEIR GANK TOO SCANTY.
Citizens of Cambridge Complain of the
Harvard Athlete*.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 21. â Re
peated complaints are coming to the Catn
brk'ge police about the costumes, or rather
the lack of costumes of the Harvard ath
letes who every afternoon run through
he streets of Cambridge for exercise.
Two years ago similar complaints were
made, and the result wa3 that the captains
:>f the various teams united in a circular
letter asking the candidates to wear more
slothing while exercising, bnt tho clothing I
lias teen petting less and less, and again
the inhabitants of Cambridge nave asked
the police authorities to take immediate
action. They say they do not mind
merely having the students run in the
streets with their tight fitting running
trunks and no stockings at all, but they
do object to having their daughters walk
ing around with men in such costumes,
it is thought that the faculty will issue an
edict on the subject soon.

geles was declared chosen by acclamation.
The proposed amendment to increase
admission fees was lost. The preamble
eulogizing the services of Grand Treasurer
Lemont of San Francisco and a motion
to present him with a suitable memento
were carried. The motion to increase the

grand patriarch was lost. At 3:30 p.m.
the grand encampment went into secret

fied by George F. Roesch, grand represen
tative, assisted by C. W. Savage, past
past grand representative.
The competitive drill was of exceptional

Tbe evolutions were of great msrit.
The prize was the Grau l Encamp

Odd Follows of Santa Cruz. The
money was divided into three prizes. No
decision was given, but San Francisco is

PHOTOGRAPHED PRINCESS TOM.
Alaska Explorer Dyche Brings From the
Yakutat Country a Valuable
Curio.
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 21.â Professor
Lewis Lindsay Dyche, the noted Green
land walrus hunter, naturalist and profes
sor in the University of Kansas, has just
returned after a summer In hunting and
exploration in the wilds of Alaska.
He was so successful and interested in
the natural history field presented in
Alaska that he intends to organize a well
equipped expedition and return to the far
North, probably in the summer of 1898.
This year ne proceeded to Cook's Inlet,
and after some explorations he made his
permanent camp at the dead of that curi
ous arm of the sea â that is, at the point
where the Kuik and the Madenuska rivers
join and enter the inlet together. This is
the place chosen the past summer by the
Alaska Commercial Company for its trad
ing post, which is in charge of a man
named Creasing;.
He had formerly been located fifty miles
further toward the sea and then his post
was 125 miles beyond Tyoonic, the prac
tical head of navigation on the inlet. The
new site of this post was chosen for the
purpose of trading with tbe Copper River
Indians, who come down the KuilÂ» and
Madenuska rivers periodical ly to trade.
At this place Dyche succeeded in making
a fine collection of the materials he was in
search of, and also in adding a number to
bis already long list of adventures.
Dyche explored the Kuik River to its
source, thirty miles, with the aid of a
crew of hardy natives. "It took two
' weeks to go up and two minutes to come
down," said the professor. He obtained
forty-two specimens of the new mountain
i sheep, Orvus dalli; twelve large moose
heads, three caribou heads, six young sea
otters, mice, birds and other, interesting
forms, including a quantity of ethnolog
ical materials and 200 photographs. He
was the first man permitted to pho'oeraph
Princess Tom, the famous Yakatat Prin
cess, who is wealthier than any other
Alaskan native.
She has $15,000 in gold buried, and
wears on her arms $200 in gold pieces ham
mered into bracelets. Sue is 65 years
old and is living with her fifth husband,
who is 20 years of age and whom she pur
chased from his parents for 500 blankets.
The Tlinkit women are masters of their
households.
In talking of Alaska, Dyche concluded:
"That country is full of glaciers slowly
tearing down rocks, the rivers are vomit
ing out quantities of quicksands, the
mountains are smoking, earthquakes are
frequent and the coal is soft. In fact, the
country is only half made. Leave it alone
for a few centuries and it will be a good
country.

WHITE CAP RULE
IN SAMS VALLEY
Masked Men Drive an Old
Resident From the
Country.
Call at His Home and Compel
Him to Travel With
Them.
HAS NOT SINCE BEEN SEEN.
The Vigilantes Said to Possess Evi
denco to Prove Their Victim's
Dishonesty.
MED FORD, Ob., Oct. 21.â The residents
of Sam 3 Valley, a settlement north of
here, are greatly excited over a whitecap
ping episode that occurred there last
Saturday. An old settler of the place was
the victim. He has since been missing
and is believed to have been driven from
the country.
About fifteen or twenty masked men
rode up to the residence of Mrs. Maty
Vincent in Sams Valley. They asked if
J. L. Adams was there. Upon being in
formed that he was they requested that
he come out. He complied, and was told
in the presence of Mrs. Vincent that he
had better prepare to die, as they were
tired of the trouble he had bien causing in
the neighborhood and it was their inten
tion to hang him. He remonstrated so
pitifully that be was given his choice of
either leaving the State or suffering deatn
at the end of a rope.
Mrs. Vincent, who is a well-respected
woman, was a witness to all that toot
place. She says that the men put Adams
into a buggy and drove off, since which
time nothing has been seen of him.
Adams is a man well alone in years and
has but one arm. He is quite well known
in this county, having been engaged in-the
book canvassing business for a number of
years. The matter has been laid before
"the Presfcuting Attorney and an investi
gation will be made.
Advices from Sams Valley, reaching
here this evening, are that the whitecaps
are reputable men, who are in possession
of facts which stamp Adams as a very dan
gerous man. It is very likely that arrests
will be made to-morrow, when the story
prompting his summary expulsion may
be disclosed.
ARRESTED AT CORONA DO.
Vice-President of a Defunct Ohio Bank
Accused of Having Falsified Returns
to the Comptroller.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Oct. 21.-Jefferson
L Watkins, late vice-president and head
bookkeeper of the collapsed Farmers'
Nationai Bank at Portsmouth, Ohio, was
arrested thi3 evening at Coronado by
United States Deputy Marshal W. J. Oakes
of Los Angeles. Watkins is charged with
rendering false reports of the bank's con
dition to the Comptroller of the Currency.
The bank failed last January, and Wat
kins turned over about $100,C00 worth of
his property to satisfy his creditors, but
since that time the Federal Grand Jury
has been at work, and it has returned an
indictment against him on forty-two
counts.
Watkins came to Coronado with his
wife and two daughters six months ago
and leased a cottage. He is about 60 years
of age and very ill, so that it is not likely
that he will live to go through the trial.
He was sitting on the porch of his cottage
when the officer served the papers. He
was completely prostrated by the sudden
turn of affairs and is now in bed.
The officer put a guard over him and
came over to this side, placing the papers
before united States Commissioner
Knoles. who fixed the bail at $30,000.
Mrs. Watkins wired to her son in Ports
mouth to see Garland Cleveland, Federal

range for bail. Marshal Oakes says that
if bail is not forthcoming he will have to
send an ambulance lor Watkins and
piace him in jail, though he believes it
will prove fatal to me prisoner.
The Government examiner found that
another official of the bauk. besides Wnt
kins was implicated, and so notified the
authorities, who have been shadowing the
man. He was not to be arrested, how
ever, until Watkins had been raptured,
so Marshal Oakes notified the Cincinnati
people immediately of his success and no
doubt the other man is now in custody.
Both of the (laughters of Watkins have
reached their majority. One of them told
Marshal Oakes that her father was penni
less, having turned over his entire fortune
to the creditors of the bank.
The cottage at Coronado, she said, was
given to them rent free by a friend. The
failure of the bank causen widespread dis
aster at Portsmouth, and Watkins' fortune
was noi enough to stem the tide. It is
said that circumstances show that Wat
kins was led into falsifying tiie reports in
order to shield others in the bank, and
that he personally was not guilty of rob
bery.
LIVELY CHASE AT FRESNO.
Crozy Tramp Captured While Trying to
Get Away With a Southern
Pacific Ticket.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 21.â A man ap
peared at the window of the local ticket
office of the Southern Pacific at 8 o'clock
this morning and asked Agent Avila for a
ticket to Los Angeles. Tne agent stamped
a ticket and gave it to the applicant, ex
pecting that he would pay for it. Instead
the man handed Avila a slip of paper on
which was scribbled the following:
C. P. Iluntington: I got a ticket to Los An
geles from your Fresno agent This makes us
even lor the time I left Albany for San *ran
cisco, when you beat me out of $8.
T. 11. Bakxess.
The man then ran out of the depot and
Agent Avila gave chase. He wanted tho
ticket back, as he would bs held responsi
ble for it. He did not consider that
harness' written explanation would be
satisfactory to Collis. Policeman Clifton
joined in the pursuit and Barness was
captured at the park. He reiused to giva
Tip the ticket ana was taken to jail, where
he was compelled to lot Avila have it.
Barness is undoubtedly unbalanced
mentally. He is a typical hobo. He says
that he purchased a ticket from Albany.
Or., to San Francisco about three years
ago and paid $16 for it. He asked tho
agent for the cheapest fare, which was $8,
but this was refused him. He was thereby
beaten out of $S, he claims, and this morn
ing he conceived the idea of getting even.
Bciore the ticket episode Barness went
Into the depot hotel and ordered a 40-cent
breakfast. He devoured it ravenously,
but whon asked to pay for it he offered
only 10 cents. He was impudent and
waliced out of the dining-room.

LOS ANGELES. Cal.. Oct. 21.âPrepa
rations are going forward for "Tom Reed
day." Everybody is enthusiastic. The
various sub-committees are working like
beavers. Those little yellow ribbons bear
ing the words, "I will march for sound
money October 27, 189 C," are becoming as
numerous as the blossoms in an orange
orchard. In all the downtown offices, on
the coats of the workinsimen, everywhere
are thej* seen. The demand for these
Bonvenir ribbons exceeds the supply. Up
to the noon hour to-day 10,000 of them had
been given out. One thousand were taken
up in iess than fifteen minutes this fore
noon at the headquarters of the Business
Men's Sound Money Club.
It has been almost definitely decided to

SAN JOSE'S SIS RALLY.
Republicans From Far and Near Wilt
Invade the Garden City on
Saturday.
SAN JOSE, Oal., Oct. 21.â A rousing
meeting of the various committees of the
local Republican clubs was held in Hale's
Hall to-night.
The committees of ladies from the sev
eral wards and the outlying districts made
reports of splendid progress for the Satur
day night rally.
A friendly rivalry is existing between
the sections as to which locality will do
the most to show its fealty to the Repub
lican party and its kindly feeiing toward
Tisitors from the bay cities.
This has resulted in a wonderful display
of enthusiasm. Commnnicatior.s accept
ing invitations are being received trom
vai iou3 clubs by every mail and President
McGraw in an interview says that it
seems as though San Francisco, Oakland
and Alameda would turn out en masse.
The great banqueting-hall is being trans
formed into a bower of beauty.
The ladies ana their assistants have
been hard at work and by Saturday will
have everything in first-class shape.
Grand Marshal Whitton reports that ac
ceptance of invitations have been received
from every club in the county. They
will turn out in force and help to" make a
display that will startle the "oldest in
habitant" and live long in the annals of
San Jose.
Theyouth and beauty of the city will
turn out to welcome the visitors in a royal
manner.
If San Jose is not overwhelmed with
guests who are anxiously looking for an
opportunity to show their belief in the
doctrines of Republicanism, she will feel
that her reputation for hospitality is
waning.
DAVIS AT LOS ANGELES.
Eloquent Speech by the Ex- Congress man
From Minnesota.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 21.â The po
litical meeting at H azard's Pavilion to
night, under the auspices of the Business
Men's Sound-money Club, was presided
over by M. H. Newmark Jr., a mem ber of
one of the leading wholesale grocery
houses of Southern California.
Mr. Newmark explained that he had al
ways voted the Democratic ticket, but
would not stultify himself by supporting
the platform and candidates of that party
tnis year.
The speaker of the evening was ex-Con
gressmen Frank F. Davis of Minnesota.
This gentleman had made many speeches
in this part of the State during the cam
paign, and had strong words of encouraae
ment for the cause of peace, protection
and sound money.
The speaker said that at nearly all the
meetings addressed by himself a large
proportion of the audiences was composed
of Democrats who. like the chairman of
the evening, were devoted to the cause of
McKinley and Hobart. He said that some
of the most sacred principles of American
institutions had been assailed by the plat
form adopted at Chicago.
For the first time in years prominent
Democratic speakers and writers were at
tempting to revive the old exploded
doctrine of State rights and of sectional
animosity. It was thought that these
doctrines had been forever settled at Ap
pomattox; but, aias, not so. The Till
mans and Altgelds were determined to re
embitter one section of the country against
another.
It was monitrous and entirely unsuited
to the present enlightenment and general
education of the people, and was sure to
meet with a rebuke on November 3. These
agitators and malcontents should never
again be able to array one part of this
common country against any other.
Reading a plank of the Democratic
platform wherein Federal Judges were a%
raigned, the speaker said that that feature
was injected therein by Altgeldof Illinois,
and was the echo of complaints against
the President because he had seen tit to
protect the people's property in Chicago
during the riots of 1894.
The Democratic party, converted by the
Populistic wing of it, had declared that it
was the right and duty of the United
States to pay its obligations in a depreci
ated and discredited money. "Are you,"
said the speaker, "in favor of tarnishing
tho eood name and credit of your coun
try?"
"No, never!" rang out from all parts of
the pavilion.

father, but he refused to send it, so you grant
me the favor. Answer immediately so I can
make arrangements to leave.
This evidently met with no response, so
he wrote the following:
Well, I have been waiting for an answer.
What are you going to do? I will not go until
I get that business I spoke about â and. another
thing, Addie, don't be telling your friend and
the ffirls all your business and laugh and call
me bad names, and think it is very funny, for
the laugh may be on my side. Remember one
thing, that wnen people have trouble, your
friendsâ your would-be friendsâ are always
ready to knife.
I was within five feet from you last night,
but did not care to speak for fear of being ia
snlted. When I call for you at the room don't
have the girls tell me that you are nor at
home, for 1 know better, and speak to me like
a woman aud cot act the part of a sneak. J.
P. S.â Send me answer by 2 o'clock, and If so
I will see an attorney. Don't forget about mat
note that I gave, bill of sale for my rig and
several other matters in regard to money that
I loand you and have good witness.
The latter disconnected letter would
seem to indicate that the trouble was
affecting his mental status, and it is
thought that the knowledge that the
woman with whopi he was so madly infat
uated had cast him off and refused further
intercouse with him, even to the loaning
of but a small portion of the large sums
he bad squandered on her; the fact that
his father refused him further aid; the
fact tbat his wife had served divorce pa
pers on him. he receiving them on the 23d
of September, and the fact that he was
threatened with arrest on> a charge of
arson and that the gates of a State prison
were opening for him, combined to drive
him to desperation and partial insanity,
and resulted in this morning's dreadful
tragedy.
Last night Lowe wrote two letters and
addressed them to his father and to a Mr.
Newman, a friend of his. What the con
tents are cannot be learned.
Senator Lowe arrived here this evening.
He refuses to open his letter until he re
turns to San Jose. He claims that
there is nothing in the arson charge
and says that, he having been confined to
his bed for some time by sickness, Gen
eral Allen had been answering his corre
spondence, and he was not aware of the
tenor of the letters received from his son
requesting money, etc.
That the young man intended to kill
the woman and then commit suicide is
further shown in two letters which he
wrote. One was to James Holman, a
friend in San Francisco, who seemed to
know all about the affairs of Lowe and the
woman, and the other was to Addie Schil
ling. In the former be complained bitterly
of the woman having deserted him. He
said he had expected to marry her and
give her a home. Lowe wrote that he
could not go back to his home in San
Jose, as he was disgraced there. He ad
milted that he had been drunk and that
he abused the woman.
She had ieft him, be said, without money
or clothing. He said that she would never
have the satisfaction of living with any
other man, and he intimated that he in
tended to commit suicide. In a letter
which Lowe wrote to the woman, under
the date of the 12th inst., he called her his
"little girl," and. after tbe use of a lot of
vile language, he said:
3y the time you receive this letter I will
be dead to the world, and bear it in mind that
you are the cause of this rash act. If there
is any truth in there being a God and that
spirits can return to this world, I will remem
ber you.
Then he proceeded to heap vile abu?e
upon the woman in relation to some
stories he had heard about her, after which
he proceeded :
You have given me dirt, and one that gives
dirt must expect the same. It is only a mat
ter of time. Little one, I wouldn't give two
bits for your life. Some one will enter your
parlor some night and then you will be minus
your breath. You will cer tainly get It, if not
in Sacramento, elsewhere.
Little one, be careful. Things look very
rocky for you. Yon will get it when you lease
expect it. Your smiles will never be as pleas
ant In a parlor as heretofore, for I will haunt
you to your dying day. for you know In your
heart you done me dirt. You made me lose
my position and I lost my wife. My name was
good for anything that I might ask for. I gave
my folks up for you, and you cannot deny
v/ilskt I say.
From this night on your life will be miser
able and you will be convinced, and others
will notice the same.
The letter was signed, ''Your unfortu
nate friend, J." A messsge was received
in this city thi3 evening from the father of
the dead girl, saying:
Give Addie burial and write particulars.
Forward me her effects. V. S. Schilling.
HIS A WASTED LIFE.
Zoxve Had Every Advantage Which Wealth
Could Supply.
SAN JOSE, Cal.. Oct. 21.â James W.
Lowe, who killed himself at Sacramento
to-day after killing Addie Schilling, was a
native of this city, and was familiarly
known as "Jimmy" Lowe. He was of a
very estimable family. In youth he had
every advantage which wealth could sup
ply-
He had been given many opportunities
to secure business advantages, his father
providing several openings for him, all of
which he neglected. He was married in
this city several years ago, but was sepa^
rated from his wife soon after. His wife
is now a resident of this city.
The young man met with a misfortune
a few years ago while working on a ranch
near Fresno.
He was compelled to sleep out of doors
for a few nights while working at a part
of the ranch .distant from the living quar
ters. The exposure resulted in rheuma
tism, which rendered him partially a crip-
Ele, Le being obliged to use a cane. He
ad been in Sacramento for some time
past.
Addie Schilling was known in San Jose.
The couple left San Jose for Sacramento
several mouths ago.
EVENTS IN THE
MIKADO'S LAND
The American Ship Luzon
Stranded on Woo
sung Bar.
Tornado Greatly Damages the
United States Consulate
at Tientsin.
THE ATROCITIES AT MANILLA.
Spanish Troops Execute Their Pris
oners by Shooting Them in
the Back.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 21.â The fol
lowing mail advices were received by the
steamer Empress of Japan to-day: The
American ship Luzon, from New York
with a cargo of kerosene oil, consigned to
the Standard Oil Company, was stranded
on Woosung bar. The ship at the time
was drawing 19 feet 9 inches, and the
water signaled at the Signal station was
20 feet 4 inches, but while crossing the bar
she took a sheer and stranded, taking
ground on a ridge of hard sand right
amidships. All efforts to float her on that
tide failed and she remained until October
6. As the tide fell the vessel remained
suspended on the ridge, with the conse
quence that she became seriously hogged
and it was feared that her back was
broken. She was floated off at high
water on the 6th and towed to Shanghai
in a very disabled condition. The steamer
Guernsey, which was following the Luzon
across the bar. was run onio the shore to
avoid a collision and remained there until
October 6.
The terrific tornado at Tientsin did
great damage to the United States Con
sulate. The railing and brick piers of the
building were twisted into every conceiv
able shape by the violence of the wind
funnel. The iron roof and large portions
of the building were lifted high into the
air and deposited in fields miles away. A
large number of natives were killed and
many boats wrecked.
James Nelson of the United States
steamer Olympia was asphyxiated by gas
during the latter part of September. He
was buried with military honors.
It is stated by many well-informed peo
ple in Hongkong thai the chief leaders of
seditious agitation in the Philippines re
side in Japan, whiiher they immigrated
from home after the Japanese triumph
over China. Their aim was to excite the
Mikado to seize the Philippines, and, in
deed, some time ago they presented his
Majesty with a petition signed by 20,000
inhabitants, asking him to invade the
islands.
Afterward, however, it was discovered
;that at least 19,000 of these signatures
were obtained by makinz the natives be
lieve they were signing a petition to the
Spanish Government for a reduction of
tuxes.
The North China Daily News has a
short special on the rebellion in the Phil
ippines, which says that the rebels are col
lected in force fifteen milea;from Manilla,
and that the Spaniards, doubting the loy
alty of their native troops, are afraid to
attack them. The Spaniards had cap
turtd seventeen rebels, whom they exe
cuted at once by shooting in thebacK.
The rebel battlecry is "Death to the Span
iards, death to the Chinese, death to the
priests."
Five hundred Chinese who have just
returned to Shanghai from Manilla give
such horrifying accounts of the situation
there that hundreds of Chinese who were
leaving for Manilla, many of whom had
already taken passage, quietly disom
barked and disappeared, and the steamer
left without a single Chinese passenger.
Several Japanese merchants of Manilla
have been arrested for selling Japanese
swords, the importation of arms being
prohibited, but Japanese swords have
hitherto been considered as curios and
their importation permitted. The Jap
anese Government is being urged to dis
patcn a man-of-war for the protectiou of
Japanese subjects in the islands.
Brigadier W. M. Powell has been ap
pointed by General Booth to command the
Japanese Salvation Army, vice Colonel
Wright, absent on furlough.
The Eastern bimetallic league has been
suddenly silenced by the clause in the
Shimonoseki treaty which gives foreigners
the right to open manufactories in China.
The British e.-peciaily were not slow to
avail themselves of this newly acquired
right, and wit'iin four months of the pub
lication of .the treaty six foreign companies
for working cotton-mills were started in
Shanghai. '
Following this result of the clause the
members of the bimetallic league gave up
their strenuous struggle and are not now
so anxious to get the difference in ex
change removed. The extent of this new
cotton manufacturing industry in China
will, it is predicted, make Manchester

SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 21.â Major E. H.
Hinman, who for a number of years was
captain of the guard at San Quentin
prison, and who is possessed of one of the
best rogrfe galleries in the State, furnishes
the following history of Albert Downen,
the self-contessed highwayman and bur

LOOKS LIKE COFFEE, V
But Made of Nature's Pure Grains â A
;' ' I'ure Food. , . â '
The ancient Germans were a sturdy race,
and history records that they were great
users of grains, in their daily food. -
Persons who stick to a plentiful diet of
grains, 1 bread, meat and fruits are reason-
ably sure to keep 'i well."' Much butter or
sweets should bo avoided, as the starch of
the food is turned to sugar and w finally to
fat. Tea and coffee make themselves felt
with thousands of Americans of the pres-
ent day. -They delay digestion, as shown
in late experiments, and this fact explains
the cause of the serious disorders which
frequently come to old and steady tea and
coffee drinkers. â  .>>:>" :
' â â 'â â  A new drink, r ; called "Postum Cereal,"
has lately, been produced by a careful
preparation of the grains, and it possesses
the important elements of being fac-simile
in looks of the: finest Mocha coffee, has a
rich, pungent flavor and is easily digested
by the weakest stomachs. It is a nourish-
ing food drink of the most perfect charac-
ter, and is quickly, taken into the system
and into the circulation. The makers claim
that "it makes red blood," and results
justify the claim. V It is especially sood for
the , production oo h a clear skin, through
which the coursing red blood can be seen
in pink and ruddy flashes, producing -that
charming complexion so much admired
in the thoroughly healthy woman or man.
; "Postum" can be used :by the', children
as well as the adults, 'i and the I chicks I be-
come very fond of their "coffee." Being
composed of grains alone it \is absolutely
pure and healthful, a natural food drink

SUICIDE AT VANCOUVEN.
Body of a Xew Tork louna Woman
Found Floating in the Inlet.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 21. - The
body of Miss Rosendahl was found this
afternoon floating in the inlet near the
city wharf. The unfortunate young
woman came hero last fall and was living
with her sister, Mrs. Rubinowitz. She
had lately been haunted with a desire to
return to New York but lacked money
to pay her fare. A week ago she said 1 to
her sister:
"Give me money or you will have no
sister to-morrow."
The money not being forthcoming she
disappeared and was not seen again until
her body was found to-day. She had told
the wife of a Baptist minister that if she
did not get the money she would drown
herself. The deceased was 25 years of age.

SANTA ANA, Cal., Oct. 21.â The
seventh annual fair of the Orange County
Association opened this afternoon witb a
iiijht attendance. Many horses did not
â  reach here from Los Angeles until to-day,
owing to the two special days' racing in
Los Angeles, Monday and Tuesday. The
racing to-day was very good, and the at
. tendance will no doubt be largely in
creased during the week. For Saturday
a special race between Klamath and Stam
f B for a purse of $COO has been arranged.
t This will be the best card o'i the meeting.
Two running races to-day were closely
contested. In the pace, Bastina, a local
pare, disappointed the crowd by being
ristanced in the first heat, owing to a bad
â¢ break on the backstretch. She was ?n
line condition, and was confidently ex
pected to win. Bill Nye, another Santa
fvnacolt, took second money.

STASFORWS GIRL ATHLETES.
Basket-Ball Jieriral Engineered by the
Co- Ed Jbuthusiastn.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
21. â The co-eds don't intend to allow in
terest in their branch of athletics to sub
. side, and as proof of the fact have called
for a meeting of all of last year's basket
pall players, as well as new players who
are sufficiently interested to come out.
. Miss McCrea, the captain of last year's
team, which defeated Berkeley, believes
that the team can be made even stronger
â  this year, and she expects to see it become
.even more popular among the women
. than it has been in the past. Most of last
year s enthusiasts are back and are eager
Vo get at practice in a game which those
who play say is "just too fascinating."
As soon as a team can be organized and
given some preliminary practice, games
will be arranged with some of the neigh
boring girls' schools and academies.
The co-fids have also revived the tennis
craze, and on Saturday will hold a tourn
ament to decide just which of their num
. ber are entitled to enter in a champion
ship tournament to be held still later.
Among the new girl students to enter this
year are said to be several excellent play
ers, and the prospects are promising for
an exciting tournament.

' in San Francisco. ;
CARSON, Nev., Oct. 21.â The victorious
Stars arc back once more in their native
sagebrush, and they are nursing a huge
disgust. " They say that they went down
as champions oi Nevada to play the cham
pions of i California. They wiped the val
ley-bred ball-pounders off I the earth last
â Sunday in the presence of 10,000 deliehted
Spectators, and supposed they had only
to play the champions of Oregon and
Washington to ; win, the Examiner trophy,
but were informed after game that
they had only beaten one of the champion
clubs of California, "and there are others."
They had a meeting, and after discussing
the matter decided to return r home and
take no further part in the tournament.
The Stars ara .already arranging for a
tour of the Pacific States under their own
management.

OGDEN CANYON ACCIDENT
Cable Tramway Car Escapes
and Dashes Down a Steep
Incline.
Distinguished Guests of the City In
jured While Being Shown
the Sights.
OGDEN, Utah, Oct. 21.â Ogden Canyon
was the scene of a serious accident this
afternoon, by which three men were
slightly and one seriously, if not fatally,
injured.
Arrangements had been made for a gala
time in honor of the presence of the city
and county officials of Salt Lake, who
came at the invitation of Ogden City to
inspect the work of the Pioneer Electric
Power Company. The party left Ogden
about 9:30 and proceeded to the canyon,
and after going through the. machine
shops had dinner, and then started up the
mountain-side.
About three miles up the canyon there
is a cable tramway, which is used to carry
up pipe for the pipe line, and two parties
of eleven made the trip up the 300- foot in
cline (45 dec.) on the car. One party re
turned- safely, but on the last trip, when
the car was about 200 feet from the bottom
of the incline, ithe brake on tbc cylinder
around which the cable was wound broke
and the car sped wildly to the bottom.
Tiie track and cable cross the Ogden
River at the bottom, and as the car
crossed the river, Clem Schramm, a promi
nent Ogden citizen, was thrown out ana
fell a distance of twenty feet onto the
rocks beiow.
The car struck the post at the end of the
incline and was thrown bacfc over the
river, where Councilman Jones, also of
Ogden, waÃ thrown out. Two others of
tiie party were hurt slightly, but the rest
were only stunned. Schramm was got
out of the river as soon as possible and
brought to town. Several of bi? ribs are
broken and he is bruised all over and in
jured internally, but whether fatally or not
cannot now L>s said.
Santa Barbara* Aged Odd Fellow.
SANTA , BARBARA, ; Cal., OcL 21.â 1n
the midst of the discussion as to who shall
carry off the : honors of being the oldest
Odd v Fellow in ,i California, Santa Barbara
wants to put in her claim. James David
son of this place will be 84 years old on
January 21. 1897. On June 10, 1839,- he
joined Wheeling Lodge No. 3, I. O. 0.F.;
of .West Virginia, "and is now a member of
Fort Jones Lodge No. V 185, of ; Siskiyou
County, Gal. He is at present making his
home with ; bis daughter, . Mrs. Birnbaum
of Santa Barbara. _ , .â >
Convicted at Mirrrtide.
RIVERSIDE, Cal., Oct. 21.â A blood
thirsty half-breed Indian named Albert
Banks was to-day convicted of assault to
commit murder on J. C. Conover. Banks,

was drank at the time of the assault. He
struck his victim on the head with a
Winchester Title, and came near killing
Conover.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1896.
POLITICS RAGING
IN THE SCHOOLS
How the Tickets Are Being
Made Up by Little
Cliques.
Said to Be Formed Outside the
Schoolrooms by Friendly
Teachers.
MORE OF THAT ASSESSMENT.
Four Candidates Were Virtuoas and
Refused to Pay the Ten Dollars
Demaadei.
If the quiet and peaceable residents of
Oakland, Berkeley, San Pablo and Ala
meda snould bear a confused bubbling
sound like the noise of many waters pro
ceeding from the hills of San Francisco
they should not feel alarmed, for tne hub
bub is simply the vocal expression of the
interest taken oy the lady teachers in the
coming election for School Directors.
They ara talking for their favorites.
Of the 900 teachers employed in this
City only about 75 or 100 belong to the
male sex. Taking the outside figures,
there would appear to be only 100 votes in
the department, but that is a fallacy, for
there are about 2500 or 3000 votes. The men
teachers can poll 100 votes, while the 800
women, although not vested with the
right of suffrage, can control from three
to four votes each, so they say.
This is why the majority of the candi
dates for the schcol board nut bouton
nieres in their coat lapels and cHI at the
schools by way of expressing their deep
interest in the cause of education. Tne
San Francisco schoolteacher whose sex is
feminine does not form a convention for
the purpose of putting a ticket in the
field and parading it under the banner of
the School Department, but she segre
gates herself into social clubs, tea lights
and so forth, and a ticket is made up by
each club, which ticket contains the
names of personal friends and the favor
ites of the members.
There are six of those independent club
tickets already in the tield, and the candi
dates on some of them have been assessed
$10 each for the purpose of obtaining a
fund with which to defray the expenses of
printing. Four Directors, who had been
asked to contribute to this fund, told some
of their friends in the School Department
about it. and those friends in turn in
formed Elisha Brooks, principal of the
Girls' High School, as to what was being
done. One of the candidates had received
a circular stating that the teachers gen
erally were making up a ticket to be sup
ported by them, that the candidate receiv
ing the circular had been selected as one
of the chosen twelve, and that a collector
wonld be around within a few days to
gatber in the $10 assessment.
Mr. Brooks was highly indignant that
the name of the school department should
have been used for such a purpose without
the authori ty of any one, and he expressed
his opinion freely at the teachers' anti
charter meeting held in Ms school last
Tuesday afternoon. His resolution de
nouncing all such attempts to mingle th c
department with political matters was
unanimously adopted, and among those
who voted were some ladies who that
very day had beer, engaged in putting up
one of those little slates to whicn refer
ence has been made.
Mr. Brooks told a Cail reporter yester
day that all that he knew about the mat
ter was what had been told him.
"Have any of the teachers in the Girls'
High School made up a ticket?" was
asked.
"O, no." replied Mr. Brooks, "if there
was anything of that kind going on they
would nave told me."
Mr. Brooks showed the reporter one of
last campaign's tickets. It was printed
on a piece ot pasteboard of the size of an
ordinary business card.
Across the face of the ticket was printed
in drawing ink with a pen the words,
"Teachers' Ticket." This was the offense
which smelled to Heaven.
A. L. Mann, principal of the Denman
Grammar School, did not know anything
about the matter except what he had read
in yesterday morning's Call. None of
the teachers in his school had been en
gaged in getting up a ticket. If they bad
he would have known of it, he said.
There was no organized effort among the
teachers looking toward that end. "We
have not been invited to become members
of any particular clique," he said. He had
no doubt that little coteries got together
and picked out their friends from among
the candidates, but there was no concerted
action and nothing in that way was being
done in the name of the department.
Miss Laura T. Fowler, principal of the
Normal School, denied that she had got
ten up or assisted in getting up the ticket
published in yesterday morning's Call as
having been the production of the Teach
ers' Mutual Aid Society. Teachers got to
gether in little bands, of course, as private
individuals, she said, and selected the best
and most moral candidates and urged
their friends to vote for them.
Mis.-* Fowler was sure that none of the
teachers in the Normal School had been
engaged in printing tickets or assessing
candidates. She added:
It Is true that I am interested in the election
of good mon to the Board of Education. It is
my right and my duty to be so, In common
with all public school teachers. We are train
ing the tuiuro citizsns of this City and Nation,
and we should be posted in the principles of
good government and on the alert with our
v : most power to help secure It.
Government is what the people make it, and
if the better class of citizens eschew it and
decline to serve in it, they should forever hold
their peace if the corrupt elements control us.
In my judgment, every moral power should
be exerted In this election to secure the best
men to govern us. As a body of working
people the teachers are not called in to select
these men; therefore, their discrimination as
to their merits after the selection is made be
comes a right, and we can do that for our
selves.
So far as a teachers' ticket is concerned I
know nothing of it. I have attended no gath
ering for such, and I know nothing ot any
"assessment" made for any purpose whatever
and I have never approached a candidate for
the office ; but I have received many personal
calls from those selected. All such -I received
with courtesy and attention to their claims
for recognition, and, so far as these gentle
men can show me good, clean indorsements
from reputable citizens for fitness and just
ness of character to work for the best interests
of our schoolsâ both teachers and pupils, for
both have rightsâ l stand ready, without fear
or favor, to speak good words for them in the
coming election, regardless of party restric
tions.
What we need in the Board of Education is
good true men, who will be independent
enough to vote for propositions according to
their personal convictions and not from rine
affiliations.
The ticket you *o facetiously call mine I
have scanned and think it. contains good can
didates so far as it goes, but you might have
added at least fifteen others equally well In
dorsed on mvlist. It had no connection what
ever with any society or combined action of
any one.
Some of these candidates are young men
who have boen my pupils. They have prown
into an honest American manhood, and thus
step forward to help bear the burdens of gov
ernment as they should.
Flrsr, lust and all the time I will give my
hearty support to all such who will convince
me that their motives are just and good. Con
trary to the new charter, I favor a larger
Board of Education than the present, for I do
not think it safe to intrust the welfare of our
schools to five Dir^clors, who can abolish our
schools at will.
Feeling thus, I reserve to myself the right
to do all in my power ns a private individual,
having the moral courage of my convictions,
for the good government of our City, and
especially her public schools.
The latest ticket in the field is a combi
nation of the following twenty-one names,
out of which twelve will be selected. It
exists only in manuscript, and is said to be
in favor among some of the teachers in the
Normal School:
Democratsâ Thomas Carew, Benjamin Ar
mer, C. Barrington, H. Conrad, F. Bragg, â
Dernam, Dr. Blake, â CuthberiKon, â Waller,
â Bantell, â Morey.

VISITS THE OTAY DAM,
A. B. Spreckels Says Construc
tion Work Is Progressing
Satisfactorily.
When Completed Its Capacity Will
Treble That of Sweetwater
Reservoir.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Oct. 21.â A. B.
Spreckels, who, with his brother, John D.
â¢Spreckels,' is interested in the Southern
California Water â¢' â  Company, which is
building tho largest water system in the
State, comprising three dams each three
times as large as the famous Sweetwater ,
dam, is at Hotel del Coronado. He re
turned yesterday from a visit to Otay dam,
in company with E. S. Babcock, president
of the company. Mr. Spreckels expressed
much pleasure at the progress being made
on the great enterprise. The Morena
dam, now being built ,by the company,
will supply the city with water.'; This is
fifty miles inland and. Mr. Spreckels did
not have time to visit it. . .
"The Olay dam >is a very great under
taking," said Mr. Spreckels, "and â¢'!= am
much pleased with the way it is being
carried out. Everything thus far has been
done in the most workmanlike manner. I
have no doubt as to the ultimate success
of the enterprise. We went out through
Chula Vista and saw the lemon â  groves,
and came back by another route and I saw
more rich land ; than 1 expected to find.
The land under the Otay system is just as
rich as that at Chula-* Vista, and all it
needs is water to make it immensely
valuable."
"What is the height of :* the dam at
present?" ' .' '.
"It will be 106 feet in height in January.
After seeing ! it and - consul with Mr.
Babcock, we have , decided .to . raise ' it to
130 feet, -which will give it a capacity three
times greater than Sweetwater reservoir.'
Water is what this country needs 1 and we
are going to get it." ; '.
. . Mr. Spreckels is j president of the San
Diego * Electric Railway ; Company. He
was asked *if be intended to extend bis
lines.
'â¢Well, we [ have ; several . extensions in
contemplation, and I shall go over the
line with General Manager Flint to-mor
row and we will decide r what to do. . The
road is in first-class condition. The ser
vice is,' I believe, appreciated- by the pub
lic. The returns are satisfactory to us." '
"Then, taKen all around, you are pleased
with the state of your investments in this
section?" , â¢â I. .:r--^'-' 'â "â  \ -r^)-
"Yes. Everything is ; as" good as could
be expected. Of course there is. a feeling
of i. uncertainty i here Â» as '} everywhere '; else
just ; before election. If McKinlev is
elected all will be well. In all ; parts of
the country there has been a disquieting
situation v, on account 'â¢' of rl the â¢, fear that
Bryan might by some chance get in. But
I notice that the stock^and bond ;; market
is easier and ; ,' more cheerful and that
money is easing up a little. ;,- /.
â  -'" "This, I believe, is because the people of
the country are I over .* their : scare ; and j are
now convinced that McKinley is to be the
next President. The great; need > of; this
country K is *: protection, ;' and McKinley
means protection. We cannot admit for
eign I products into this country in compe
tition with our own and keep wages up to
where they are now. 3t is absurd to talk
about it. The more America protects her
self the better it will fbe I for her. We pay

Pwjrt Siiu-Kt Competition.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wasii., Oct. 21.â
The tramp steamship Aramapoora, now
due from Nagasaki, Japan, will load a
general cargo at Tacoma for Central
American ports. It is believed that the
vessel is under secret charter to the Pn
cific Mail, which is heartily opposed to the
â success that is being met with by the
Puget Sound and Central American* linÂ».
This company's steamship Transit has
been making deep inroads into the
revenues of the Pacific Mail, which until
quite recently held full sway on the Cen
tral American coast, and it is believed
that the Aramapoora has been secretly
chartered by it to run the Transit off the
-oute.

A SETBACK FOR
THE RAILROAD
Geary - Street Franchise
May Not Be Sold at
Present.
Judge Daingerfield Rules That
the Proceedings Were
Illegal.
PERCENTAGE BIDS ARE VOID.
But Privileges Already Granted on
the Sam: Basis May Not Be
Disputed.
The present Board of Supervisors will
not grant the proposed new franchise for
the Geary-street road. Judge Dainger
field yesterday decided that the cor
poration of the provision for the
payment of 2 per cent of the
gross receipts of the proposed road, as
part of the bid for the franchise, renders
illegal the whole proceeding. The mat
ter would, therefore, have to be done all
over again and new bids advertised for
before a franchise could be disposed of.
According to the citizens' defense law, no
Board of Supervisors may let a franchise
within ninety days of tne expiration of
their term of oflice, and as the present
board will retire before that length of time
has elapsed it caii take no further steps in
the matter.
Judge Daingerfield'a decision is as to
demurrers to petitions for a writ of re
view, of prohibition and of injunction,
prayed for by Georsa R. Fletcher, to re
strain the Board of Suporvsors from sell
ing the privilege of operating a street rail
road over the present route of the Geary
Street, Park and Ocean Railroad for a
period covering the next fifty years.
It was alleged In the petition that the
conditions imposed upon bidders for the
franchise are such as to prevent fair, open
and public competition, and that the con
ditions were so made for the purpose of
restricting successful bidding to the Geary
street road, which is now being operated
under n franchise which will not expire
until 1903. It is further alleged that the
franchise advertised is worth $1500,000,
and that but $500,000 could be obtained for
it under the conditions advertised.
The attorneys for the Supervisors de
murred to the complaints, alleging that
the court had no jurisdiction in the mat
ter, and consequently could not issue a
writ either of prohibition or review. His
Honor, however, holds that grounds exist
on which a writ of review or certiorari
may issue, for the reason that it is alleged
in the petition that the application tor the
franchise purports to have been made by
the Geary-street, Park and Ocean Rail
road Company, but was not in reaiity
made by that company, and that under
the circumstances the right of whoever
made the application depends upon mat
ters of law and fact within tlie judicial
powers of the board to ascertain, weigh
and pass upon. Therefore, the board
would be acting judicially, and hence
would be subject to a writ of review.
Judge DaingerfielU remarks iv his de
c.'sion that if the resolution passed by tho
board and its record were both valid on
their face, and no other jurisciictional
defect existed, there would be nothing for
tho court to annul. It appears to him,
however, that the provision requiring the
payment of 2 per cent of the gross annual
Income accruing, from the franchise con
travenes the requirements of the act of
1893 that, franchises must be awarded to
the highest bidder, and thus vitiates the
entire Droceedings.
"When a statute says 'highest bidder' it
means highest bidder for cash or ready
money," says his Honor. "Gross receipts
mny be large or small and are always in
definite and uncertain. Tho amount is
elusive and dependent on many condi
tions. A franchise may be so sought
merely to shut off competition, and with
no intension to make the cross receipts
anything more than nominal.
"The resolution of the board requiring
the payment of a percentage is an insep
arable part of its determination to grant
the franchise and is in excess of the juris
diction of the Board of Supervisors. The
resolution and advertisement constituted
a determination, presumably founded
upon proper evidence, that the applica
tion was legally grantable. The act pro
vides for no further examination into the
propriety of the sale of the proposed fran
chise and therefore such determination is
final so far as the board is concerned. The
board has power to incorporate all lawful
terms and conditions into the franchise
that it deems proper, whether stated in
the application for the franchise or not;
but when it determines to sell to some one
other than the highest bidder it deter
mines in excess of its jurisdiction. The
provision exacting an annual percentage
is inseparable from the rest of the judg
ment and vitiates it throughout. The de
murrer to the application for a writ of re
view is overruled."
With regard to the petition for an in
junction, it is decided that the petition
counts on fraud and breach of trust, but
neglects to state who intends or designs
the evils complained of, and is therefore
indefinite. His Honor advises that the
complaint be amended in this particular
and grants ten days time in which it may
be done.
In conclusion, he said that he did not
deem "it necessary to pass upon the ques
tion whether the effect of the decision of
the Supreme Court referred to was to in
validate franchises already in oporation,
wherever percentages of current incomes
had been exacted, but considered it proper
to state that where such percentages had
been exacted and paid upon the faith of
the validity of the franchise, both the mu
nicipality and the franchise-holder were
estopped from disputing that validity."
Although the writ of certiorari may
now issue, there is nothing to review and
ths matter will probably be dropped.

FOB VICF-PKESI DENT-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, 1896.
Hanna's answer to Jones was a center
shot.
The Popocrat manager has been called
down on his bluff.
People who talk of coercion should
name the coercers.
California should no longer be counted
as a doubtful State.
If Bryan really meals well it is a pity
he does not say something that sounds
well. _ .
The appeal to revolution makes a great
deal of noise, but it finds no echo from
the people.
Reduced to its last analysis the whole of
Bryan's canvass is an attack on prosperity
and the wealth that it leads to.
Every business man in the country who
looks forward to prosperity is looking
toward the election of McKinley.
The Bryan movement after all is only
an excrescence on American politics. It
was born of the bad times and will vanish
with them.
It is hich time for the Bryanites to be
hunting their overcoats. Two snowstorms
have occurred in the East and election
day is at hand.
Mark Hanna is making no sectional
campaign. He is fighting for the whole
Union, ami stands a good chance to carry
nearly all of it.
About all the Democrats can do now is
make faces at Mark Hanna, and while
that is not very effective in making votes
it may perhaps relieve their feelings.
The Republican party has ever been the
champion of a free ballot and a fair count.
Coercion has never been practiced in this
country except in Democratic States.
Recall the story of the Chicago conven
tion and then ask yourself if you are will
ing to entrust the Government to the men
who follow Altgeld and Till man in that
crowd.
Bryan promised as much for free trade
as he now promises for free silver and the
country can judge by the result of his
former promise what the present one is
â worth.
Hard times invariably lead to discon
tent among the people and discontent al
ways makes the matter worse. Let us
vote for law and order and prosperity and
all will be well.
The price of wheat has risen nearly 25
cents a bushel within five weeks and every
point made in that upward movement has
added new votes to, the side of McKinley
and prosperity. . ' .
The Bryanite organs are not wholly
wrong in declaring the McKinley move
ment has something to do with the rise in
the price of wheat. Good politics always
â lakes good prices. '
. If at any time in the campaign Mr.
Bryan he's showed by any word or deed a
fitness to be President it has not been
noted by the people and his organs have
never pointed it out. â¢
Chairman Butler of the Populist Na
tional Committee says the rise in the' price
of wheat was caused by the wicked gold
men and seems to look upon it as another
case of horrible coercion.
' The fact that Tillman has been shoved
into the background during the campaign
is a proof that even the Bryan managers
know they must not go too far in impos
ing upon the patience of the American
people.
Bryan's tour in Ohio may prove in the
end to be beneficial to him, for it has given
him a proof of the strength of the McKin
ley sentiment and done much to counter
act the folly which his flatterers have put
into his head. .
â  Â« â¢â 
To coerce a voter, is a crime and, as : Mr.
Hanna says, if Bryan or Jones knows of
any coercing they made ; themselves the
accomplices of the crime. by not informing
the proper authorities and taking steps
for prosecution.
Â«
Give to the industries of California an
adequate protection .'; and the energies of
her people will do the rest. Every dollar
of our gold will be pat into circulation,
there will be profits for every producer and
employment for every workingman. :
The impression made by the speech of
Mr. Boutelie will long' remain with the
people of San Francisco. U will connrm
the allegiance of the. wavering to the Re
publican cause and add to the ardor Â»of
the loyal in the battle for victory.
VICTORY ASSURED.
In no possible way can the fusion man
agers figure oat anything like a showing
for the success of Mr. Bryan. The revolt
of conservative Democrats against the
Chicago ticket has more than offset any
gains that may possibly be made from the
ranks of the Populists. Even the Populist
gains will be smaller than was hoped for by
the fusionists. There are stalwart Popu
lists as there are stalwart Democrats, and
these will not support the fusion ticket
any more than will that band of patriotic
Democrats who, setting the welfare of the
country above party success, have decided
to vote this year either for Palmer and
Buckner or for McKinley, according as
such. votÂ« will help most to defeat Bryan
ism.
Fusion tickets have never been success
ful in American politics. The people of
this country stand for great political prin
ciples, and are never willing to be led into
the abandonment of their principles for
the sake of electing a certain set of
politicians to office. Even had they been
tempted to do so in this case, they would
have been turned from it by the nature of
the fusion which seeks their vote. It has
been the worst elements of Democracy and
Populism that have fused to produce the
Chicago platform and the Chicago ticket.
In the Bryan, Altgeld, Tillman and Peffer
combination there is nothing attractive to
an American citizen. On the contrary,
there is everything to repel him with indig
nation and disgust
From all parts of the Union come re
ports which make it sura that not only
will all the steadfast Republican States
vote for McKinley, but many of those
which in former elections have been
counted solidly Democratic will give their
electoral vote this year to the Republican
candidate. New Jersey, Delaware, Mary
land and West Virginia may be couuted
sure as Republican States. There are
bright prospects for carrying Kentucky and
Missouri, as well. New York has ceased
to be doubtful, nor are Indiana and
Illinois to be included in that column.
The whole Nation is more nearly unani
mous this year than ever before.
How will California stand in this con
test? Is it possible that this State can be
accounted doubtful when such an issue is
presented to its people? Every interest of
business as well as every instinct of patriot
ism impels the people of California to
range themselves on the side of the great
mass of the American people. California
must stand with Maine, New York and
Ohio for protection, prosperity and the
law of the land.
If there has been any doubt heretofore
how the vote of this State will be cast it
ha 3 been occasioned solely by lukewarm
ness in the ranks of the Republican party
or from over-confidence arnons the people.
Thousands of conservative Democrats in
this State are to-day prepared and ready
to act with their law-abiding fellow-citi
zens to elect McKinley and it needs only
that the campaign shall he conducted
with due earnestness to make victory here
as sure as it is in the Union at large.
Let the Republicans of the State maka
an aggressive fight for the brief period that
remains of the campaign. Let them
cordially welcome the assistance of every
patriotic Democrat. Let all good citizens
assert themselves. Let us make sure that
the vote of California shall be counted on
the side of protection and law.
Give us direct and ample transporta
tion facilities under the American flag,
and controlled by American citizens; a
currency sound in quality and adequate
in quantity; an international bank to
facilitate exchanges, and a system of re
ciprocity carefully adjusted within the
lines of protectio ; and not only 'will
our foreign commerce again invade
every sea, but every American Indus
try will be quickened and our whole
people. feel the impulse of a new and
enduring prosperity â Hon. William
Windom.
CALLED DOWN.
Senator Jones, chairman of the Demo
cratic National Committee, has been most
emphatically called down. His recent
manifesto charging the employers of labor
with having attempted to coerce working
men into voting the Republican ticket has
heen challenged by Mr. Hanna. The chal
lenge is direct, terse and forcible. It calls
upon Senator Jones to furnish proof of
the truth of his charges under penalty of
being discredited before the country.
The aggressive portion of Mr. Hanna's
reply is embodied in the words: 'To co
erce a voter is a crime against the laws of
the land, and if Messrs. Bryan and Jones
know of any coercing they make them
selves accomplices of the crime by not in
forming the proper authorities and taking
siepsfor prosecution."
What have the Bryanite orators and
organs to reply to that?
Mr. Hanna v>ry justly says the cry of
coercion raised by the Bryanites is "an in
sult to both the employer and employe."
It is a wrone to American manhood. The
workiegmen of this country are inde
pendent and could not be coerced into a
surrender of the free ballot by any power
on earth. The employers of America are
true-hearted Americans and would never
be so false to justice and patriotism as to
attempt to subvert the laws of this coun
try and the liberties of their fellow-citi
zens.
The Republican party can afford to treat
this senseless cry of coercion with the
scorn which it deserves. The grand old
party from its very origin has ever been
the champion of labor and of a free ballot
and a fair count. One of its long contests
with Democracy has been over this very
issue of coercion practiced in the Southern
States. This is well known to every in
telligent voter, and it was hardly neces
sary for Mr. Hanna to say the Republican
National Committee "will Bpare no pains
to secure to every citizen, whatever his
politics, the right to cast his vote accord
ing to his convictions and have his vote
honestly counted."
Let your verdict this year be for hon
est money, public security, National
tranquillity, a protective tariff and re
ciprocity, and, abÂ»ve all, let there
â onnd forth a verUUt for this Nation of
law and order and its enthronement in
every corner of the RepublicâMcKin
ley.
LAW-LOVING DEMOCRATS
"The buttress of liberty is order. The
bell tower of order is the law. Both liberty
and order are assailed by the platform of
the Chicago convention. To that extent
and in that regard it was distinctly a con
cession to the exactions of Governor Alt
geld and Senator Tillman."
It la in these words that Henry Watter
son calls the conservative Democrats of
Kentucky to repudiate the actions of the
political adventurers who, having stolen
the name of Democracy, are now endeav
oring to delude Democrats into following
the worst form of Populism and the lead
ers of incipient anarchy. Mr. Watterson
does not stand alone in this protest
against the men who are now seeking to
disturb not only the finances of the coun
try, but to overthrow the maintenance of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1896.
law itself. In every part of the country
Democrats scarcely less known and less
eloquent than himself are denouncing the
Chicaso platform and the Chicago ticket,
and with a genuine patriotism are declar
ing themselves on the side of sound money
and the preservation of the dignity of
American law.
It is easy to understand that these
stanch and conservative Democrats find it
difficult to break away from their party
ties and unite with political opponents to
bring about the crushing defeat of their
party candidate.- This, however, is not
the first time that Democrats of patriotism
and intelligence have been called upon to
make such a choice. Stephen A. Douglas,
the great leader of Northern Democracy,
found such a choice before him in 1860,
and most nobly did he respond to it. John
A. Dix, though at the time an office
holder under a Democratic administra
tion, with a patriotism not less than that
of Douglas, declared himself also in favor
of the maintenance of the Nation against
those who sought to overthrow it, and
gave utterance to those memorable words,
which will live forever in the hearts of the
people: 'If any man attempts to haul
down the American flag shoot him on the
spot."
The issue to-day is not one of war, but
it is scarcely less well defined. It is the
issue of law and order against the agita
tors and lawless elements of the country.
Today, as in 1860, Democrats who love
their country more than their party have
to make the choice which was imposed
upon Douglas and Dix and the thousands
of loyal Democrats of a former generation.
As Mr. 'Watterson declares, "the buttress
oi liberty is order, the bell tower of order
is the law." From that tower rings the
bell of alarm and of warning to-day. It is
fortunate for the country tnat good citi
zens of all parties will respond to it.
Democracy is on trial before the Nation,
and it is a satisfaction to every patriot to
see that this party now as in the
past is not lacking in men who are worthy
of American citizenship and true and
faithful supporters of American liberty
and American law.
I am confident that the men "who
work, whether for salary or by the day,
will be with the Bepublican party in
this campaign for honesty and for a
souud, one-hundred-cent dollar. Any
oiher interpretation of the attitude of
the wage-earners would be an insult to
their patriotism and their intelligence,
for they have more at stike in this
issue -than any other class of men. â
Mark Hanna.
DESPERATE TACTICS.
It is now clearly evident that the Bryan
ites intend to make in the closing weeks
of the campaign a desperate effort to
arouse labor against capital and every dis
contented man against his more prosper
ous neighbor. The argument for free
silver has been abandoned as completely
as the argument for free trade. The one
cry uttered from the orators on the stump
and appearing day after day in the Bryan
ue organs i 3 the cry of coercion and in
timidation. Everything which ingenuity,
misreptesentation and falsehood can do to
alarm the people into the belief that the
great employers of the country are trying
to force workingmen to vote for McKinley
will be resorted to from now until election
day.
A striking illustration of the tricks
which will be devised for this purpose
appeared yesterday in the San Francisco
Examiner. The paper flared up under
scare headlines and in large print a letter
from Henry C. Caldweli, United States
Circuit Judge at Bt. Paul, written in
answer to the editor of the World- Herald
of Omaha, declaring that it will not be
necessary for the employes of corporations
under Federal receiverships over which he
has any control to vote for McKinley or
Bryan or any ether Dolitical office-seeker in
order to hoM their places. The plain intent
of the publication of tlis letter is to induce
the credulous to believe that coercion is
to be employed by some corporations.
The letter itself, however, contains no in
timation of the kind, and when rightly
construed is nothing more than a repu
diation of the idea that tli great railroads
oi the country are likely to attempt any
such coercion.
We can well understand the indignation
of Judge Caldweli in being called upon to
answer '.hi^ impudent inquiry of the
Worid-Herald. The question asked of him
was insolent in the highest degree. By
what right did the eiitor a-<sum* that the
Judge would be likely to exert coercion
upon the employes of the raiiroads under
receiverships appointed by his court? If
the Judge, however, had abstained from
answering the question, as he might well
have done on the plea that such insolence
wer best treated â with contempt, the
malicious Bryanite organs would havn
been sure to charge him with being afraid
to answer. Now that he has answered
with clearness and with dignity, they print
his letter beneath flaring headlines as if
he had joined with them In denouncing
some actual coercion of voters.
It is not easy to answer what mighf be
called "a whoop in hell," and the cries of
coercion are certainly in the nature of
such whoops. The common-sense of the
people must be relied upon to estimate
these charges at their worth and the in
dignation of the people counted on to em
phatically rebuke them at the polls.
There is no coercion in this country, and
he who asserts that the American work
ingman either is or can be coerced is a
libeiou.i maligner of the manhood of the
country.
WHEAT AND SILVER.
United States Investor.
The noteworthy thing about the rise in
wheat 1b that it has been unaccompanied by
an advance in silver. These two commodities
are supposed by some persons to benr a marked
resemblance to the Siamese twins. But It
seems that during the last few weeks the one
has abandoned the other in a most shameless
fashion. We find wueat advancing about 13
cents a bushel since September 1, while silver
has had hard work to keep itself on a level
with the then price (66% cents). We shall
have to go buck to 1892 to find prices for
wheat In October at all comparable to those
quoted since the beginning of the present
month, and when we get back to 1892 we
find that the average price of silver for
the year was over 87 cents per ounce, the
minimum quotation for that period being over
75 cents. With October quotations on wheat
st> far about on a level with th< se of October,
1892, we note a heavy falling off in the price
of silver. An explanation from the free
silver laction of the advance in wheat is
awaited with Interest. The answer may be
that peculiar conditions have intervened
this year to counteract the usual tendency
to a union on the part of wheat and silverâ a
short crop abroad and manipulation at home,
for instance. But if this is the plea of the sil
verites is it uot incumbent upon them toshow
beyond all question that all the phenomena
witnessed in connection with wheat and silver
since 1873 have not in like manner been due
to peculiar conditions?

HON. GROVE L. JOHNSON.
Grove Laurence Johnson, the Republican nominee for Congress in the Second
District, is a native of New York, 55 years of age. He studied law, and was admitted

sembly in 1878-79, and of the California State Senate in 1830, 1881 and 1882. Mr. John
son's practice as a lawyer has not been coafined to Sacram*>nto, but he has been en
gaerea in many important legal contests tnroughout the State. He Conducted the

HOW THE TIDE RUNS
Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
Seven States have held Staie elections this
year. Five of them have gonu Democratic
and two Republican. Wherefore the stricken
Popocrats pretend to see a glimpse ol hope for
'heir cause in the coming National election.
That is one way of looking at it. Another way
is pointed out by the Pitts tmrg Dispatch,
which thus compares the pluralities irven in
those States with the pluralities of 1892:
1892. 1896.
Vermont 21.000 36.00

LALY'S JACKET.
The arrangement of the fullness of the skirt
of this jacket is one of the best liked or the
season. The center seam is lapped, the full
ness being supplied by side plaits at other
seams.
Lady's cloth made with velvet collar, a skirt
of the same, makes an extremely stylish and
useful costume suitable for almost any occa
sion.
Jackets of tan cloth are made of smooth
faced materials, with velvet collars of same
shade.
For general wear costumes of cheviot, serge,
etc., with skirt and jacket matching, make the
most economic investment.
Mixed effects are often chpsen, with lining
to match one of the colors in the fabric.
For extra jackets to be worn with any skirt'
plain colors axe best liked.
MUSIC AND MUSICIANS,
A Trieste newspaper, II Mattino, tells what
appears to be a well authenticated piece of
news illustrative of the remarkable facility of
ear possessed by Tzech musicians. It appears
that a few days ago the Tzech orchestra of
P.aab, directed by Farkas, was playing an en
gagement at Vienna and appeared at a fash
ionable festival, for which Johann Struuss had
composed a new waltz. During the first inter
val Count S. said to Farkas: "In a few mo
ments Strauss is going to conduct a perfectly
new waltz. If a moment after your orchestra
can also perform it I will give you 300 florins.
"Meg less Meltosay" (That shall be done, your
excellency), replied Farkas; and in effect
Strauss had hardly terminated when the
Tzech orchestra executed in its turn the new
waltz with perfect, exactitude, except that a
few lucarnes were filled with the cymbalum.
Strauss was stupefied; then he talked of cor
ruDtion and taid hi 3 score must have been
stolen. But Count S. immediately tranquilized
him by explaining the remarkable facility of
ear possessed by the Tzechs. After the bank
notes given by the Count others from different
people present found their way to Farkas'
pocket, and StrausÃ wanted to contribute, too.
Farkas, however, would accept nothing but a
handshake from the composer and a promise
of the pianoforte score of tne new waltz.
Fannie Bloomnelfl Zei3ler. who gives her
first concert here November 10, is not insensi
ble to the allurements of flattery, as the fol
lowing story told by he.r advance agent shows:
Last winter Mrs. Zeisleaj gave a recital at
Cincinnati before the Ladies' Musical dub of
that city. Every seat in the hall was taken by
the members of the club and a few of their
favored friends. The general public was ex
cluded and there were no seats for sale. An
old doctor from a neighboring town presented
himself at the door and piteously pleaded for
admission, but met with a stern refusal. So he
planted himself at the stage entrance and
awaited the arrival of the artist. As she got
out of her carriage he told her that he had
heard her once before at a symphony concert
in Cincinnati, and that he had traveled twenty
miles through a snowstorm to hear her again,
ana asked if she would not help him to gain
admission to the hall. He appealed not in vain.
The generous aitist said: '-Come right with
me, my friend. I will take you along into the
greenroom, and from there you will slip into
the hall, and if they stop you I shall refuse to
play. You are my guest."
Signor Luigi Arditi, who has played no in
considerable part in the history of Italian
opera in this country, has publishea under the
title of "My Reminiscences" a volume of me
moirs. In the course of a long and distin
guished career Signor Arditi has met many
famous composers and singers, and they do
not, from the anecdotes he tells of then, seem
to be nearly so entertaining off the stage as
they are on. He gives a lively account of the
doings at Craig-v-Nos when Mme. Patti, whose
acquaintance he first made when she was a lit
tle girl singing in New York, opened her pri
vate theater at her castle. They celebrated the
occasion in fine style, and "450 bottles of
champagne were consumed at supper." The

SILVER COINAGE.
Why the Present by stem of Coining Sil
"' ver Is Better lhan free Coinage.
Sax Francisco, Oct. 21, 1896.
â¢- To the Editor of The Callâ Will you kindly
give place to the following as offering an
argument not yet advanced by any of tin
sound-money men, so far as I have seen.
We can speak to no issue in this campaign,
except on the "silver" question, for Bryan wil]
not discuss protection, and that is not really
the issue, for : it will not be discussed by the
Bryan partisans.
Bryan is to bring relief to the idle, the bun*
gry and the naked, by the free and unlimited
coinage of silver. But we cannot coin silvei
.without - limit. . The highest estimate of the
capacity of all the ..United States mints com
bined is fifty millions per annum. Conserva
tive . men place the limit from forty to forty
five mil.ions. in order to make Bryan's prom
ise good we must increase, at least double oui
mints, and it takes a long, weary time to past
'acts of Congress to erect even a single mint
With the capacity :we have now we could
not coin more than forty-five millions pet
year. } :
in a late edition of the newspapers I saw
a small paragraph of less than a dozen lines,
to which no especial attention was called, anil
the significance of , which no .one seemed to
appreciate, but it had a meaning, for .the
tuoughtiul, and that was a report of the coin
age 01 the mints of the United States for the
month of September, just pawed. This showed
that during me month of-- September the
United States mints coined 2,700,000 standard
silver $837,428 of whicu went to the
Government as proht, which oi course belong!
to the people. â  > â¢
I have lost my clipping for August, but the
figures were in round numbers $2,650,000,
with a profit to the Government of upward^ oj
$800,000. . .
; - Now, mat is at the rate of 33,000,000 of sil
vei dollars per annum which we are now com
ing during a Democratic "goldbug" adminis
tration, I'nis is almost as much silver coined
as Mr. Bryan and his friends propose and
promise to perform lor the buffering memDers
of this Republic. r*j&Â§3&sjÃÃ&B&feg&&iasS
. i Now, the Government, receiving the seig
moriage, iÂ» bound to stand behind these silver
doi>ara and hold them all &ta parity with gold;
but Bryan proposes to coin , all the silver pos
sible (not ; possibly much more than is now.
ing coined) tree, wiiuout any charge. l;ut â
what is â¢ the resu t ? First, the Government
will not hold it at or with a parity with gold,
and, second, Who will be benefited by the iree
coinage ? Why, Stewart, Teller, Newiami.s, and
that class 01 silver capitalists. Not the poor
man, nor the laborer, lor, besides not being
able to get any . of â¢ it, he Has to bear the ex
pense of coining it, for he is part of the Gov
ernment. :. . . â  .
.Then, if the coin should not be depreciated,
as the Bryan men promise it will not be, will
follow what all the Hryan orators and Bryan
himself so loudly deploresâ another | crowd of
capitalists, and, where there is one capitalist
made, according to Bryan, there are a thou
sand men mane paupers.
To sum it up, I would rather have the Gov
ernment go on coining at the rate they hava
been and are now coining â to tne full
capacity of the mints, which is kept, up to
a parity with gold â than to have a promise
to coin unlimited* (which means but a little
I more than is now- coined) and -free, which
means that we snail, allot' us, put our hands
in our pockets and pay the expense of coining
money for the .benefit of the siiver-bullion
holders and mine-owners.' Very respectfully,
Leonard S. Clarke.
HOW TO DO IT.
New York Sun (Dem.).
The way to beat the boy oratorâ Bryan, the
Presidential candidate who stands for an
archy, National disgrace and the iree-silver
fraud, is to elect William McKinley.
The way to elect McKinley is to vote for him.
And don't you forget it!

ANOTHER RATE
WAR IS NOW ON
Freight Rates Between Here
and Mazatlan
Slashed.
The Orizaba Will Take Out
Merchandise at a Very
Low Figure.
FUETHEE CUTS NOW EXPECTED
A General Strike Among the Long
shoremen Is Anticipated to Fo!Â«
low the Cat on tbe Sadie.
There is another rate war on. The
steam schooner Protection has gone into
the Central American trade, and in con
sequence a cut in rates is i:i order. The
new boat touches at Mazatlan, and thus
cuts into the trade of Goodall, Perkins &
Co.'s Orizaba. The latter vessel is to leave
on the 25th inst., and in order to offset the
next trip of the Protection the following
circular was sent out yesterday :
PACIFIC COAST STEAMSHIP COMPANY.
Notice to shippers'. Cut freight rates, San
Francisco to Mazatlan, Mexico! Steamer Ori
zaba, sailing from tan Francisco October 25,
1896, at 10 a. M. General merchandise, $5
(Mexican silver) per ton, weight or measure
menu Goodall, Perkins & Co., General Agents.
The ProtÃCtion charges $5 a ton in gold,
while the Orizaba willcarry goods at $5 in
Mexican Money. This virtually means a
reduction of 60 per cent, as a Mexican
dollar is only worth 50% cents in ban
Francisco.
There was a miniature strike on the
water front yesterday that may grow into
large dimensions. The longshoremen
near the Powell-street end of ttie front
have a grievance and yesterday struck for
their rights. A few weeKS ago the Golden
Gate Lumber Company sold out to the
D. B. Bibb Lumber Company. The
| former concern was in the habit of paying
the longshoremen 30 cents an hour for
ten hours' work, bnt when the latter firm
took control the rate was cut to 20 cents.
I Yesterday the schooner Sadie and the
steamer Empire began discharging at
section lof the seawall. When the men
learned of the cat they all struck and the
schooner was practically tied up.
The steamer put the crew at work, and
with her steam winches managed to get
nearly all her cargo ashore. The Sadie
was idle all day, as all the men who could
be got to work did not move over a lew
thousand feet of lumber.
All the Bibb Company's boats will be
boycotted in future, and unless the old
rate of 30 cents an hour is restored the
strike is likely to sptead to other lines of
coasters which have given notice of a win
ter reduction.
The Bibb Company asserts that it is
making no money, owing to slack busi
ness and low rates. If it comes to a ques
tion of paying 30 cents an hour for dis
charging, the Empire, Sadie and other
vessels will be iaid up for the winter. The
men say that the vessels are all paying,
and that the cry of dull times is only an
excuse to cut wages.
Among the arrivals yesterday were the
barkentine City of Papeete, from Tahiti.
Captain Lunn reports tin uneventful pas
sage. He took the place oi Captain Be
rude, who remained behind on account of
sickness. Since the death of August
Schmitt (Pinei & Co.) it is not known who
will manage the City of Papeete, Tropic
BirJ and Galilee, but the chances are that
Berude will assume control and that Lunn
will remain on the Papeete.
The Glassendale and Miltiades got in
from Australia, the Jean d'Arce'from
N. ft. W. ; the Socotra from
Hongkong, the Santiago from Hilo, H. I. ;
the Elweil from ISanaimo, B. C. ; and the
Lamoriciere from Valparaiso in ballast.
All the vessels report light and variable
winds during their ent re voyages.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
"As You Like It" Will Be
Given at the Baldwin
To-Night
Success of the Tivoli Bicycling
Night â Benefit at the
Alcazar.
It is said that tbe Tabers were anxious
to receive San Francisco's veraict on
"Romola." If so the rows of empty
benches at the Baldwin nave spoken more
eloquently than words. They may take it
for granted that no amount of good acting
can save "Romola." As a drama it is hope
less, and the best thinx the Tabers can do
is so consign it to the study, where George
Eliot's novels properly belong.
'â¢As You Like It" will be presented this
eve nine, and in all probability will mark
the real opening of the Tabers' season.
A very good performance of "The Ugly
Duckling" is being given at the Alcazar.
The play is interesting and the strone
dramatic situations are made much of by
the company. John T. Sullivan as Count
Maletesta and Miss May Buckley as The Ugly
Ductti ng shnre the nonor*, but Carl Smith, J.
B. Polk, Frank Dcmne and Mrs. F. M. Bates are
doing excellent work.
The Catnolic Ladies' Aid Society No. 2 will
be tendered a benefit at the Alcazar this
evening.
Florence Bindlev's "Pay Train" is doing a
large business at the Grand. The piece is very
handsome'y stayed, and the company at the
Grand are doing it full justice.
Bicyclists and their friends fillbd the Tivoli
Opera-house last night. The galleries were
prettily draped with flags, and a number of
"gaÂ«s" touching local bicycling matters were
introduced by Ferris Hart man. The chorus of
bicycling gins was especially applauded.
Everyone considered the Ca.ifornia Asso
ciated Cycling Clubs' evening had been a com
plete success.
"Town Topics," which is holding down the
Columbia Theater this week, its a string of
variety "turns" held together by a plot which
is almost too gauzy to beepi.arent. Most of
the joices merit the respeot due to old age, al
though it is but fair to add that the audience
hail them witb hi.nrlty. S-jme of the "turns"
are very far from what one would expect to
tind in a theater sacred to the memory of the
polite, well-dressed, well-bred Frawleys.
The Horn brothers and Miss Joe Reeves have
made a great hit at the Orpheum this week.
They are, without exception, the best English
artists who have ever appeared at this house.
A number of the other new acts are going

A large audience gathered at Metro
politan Temple last evening to hear Rsv.
T. Caraher's lecture on "Dangers to the
Republic." The lectnre was given under
the auspices of Bermingham Couucil No.
59, Y. M. 1., the proceeds to go to tne
benefit of the Presentation Convent.
Frank J. Sullivan, in his remarks as
chairman of the evening, gave a history of
the foundation of the order of nuns who
conduct Presentation Convent. He stated
that no less than 20,000 pupils have been
educated tiy these good sisters in this City
alone.
After an organ solo by Miss Georeriana
and a song by W. J. Hynes, Father
Caraher was introduced. He said in part:
Shortsighted indeed must be the man who
desa not see dangers threatening this ReDublic,
and he is unpatriotic if he does not point them
out. I perceive these perils and feel that I
snould sound the signal of alarm, for I allow
no living man to surpass me in love for this
country. While I love the land that gave me
birth, I am ready to stand or fall with the Re
public of Washngton.
The first clanger threatening this country is
religious bigotry and intolerance. Although
the Declaration of Independence makes no par
ticular allusion to religious liberty, yet free
dom to worship ana religious tolerance spring
naturally from its principles.
The constitution expressly forebade the
making oi a man's relicion a test of his fitness
for office. George Washington frowned down
all such attempts and occasionally worshiped
in Catholic churches. In the face oi such an
example we have since had frequent exsmoles
of religious bigotry. The persons and prop
erty of Catholics have been frequently violated.
At the instance of Rev. JLyman Beecher the
Ursu.ine Convent was burned by a fanatical
mob. This is a stain upon America. In the
days of Know Nothingism the streets of some
Eastern cities ran red with Catholic biood.
Within the last few years frequent attempts
have been made to revive the doings of those
day.".
Three years apo 3000 A. P. A.'s, headed by
the Mayor of Toledo, Ohio, were actually
awaitinp the signal to slauehter their Catholic
lclliiw-civizens. It would seem that the
Catholics of that city should have been able
to cope with that force, but they were unpre
pared and unaware. Again, the police lorce
and military, under the command of the
Mayor, were rcadv to aid the A. P. As.
Recently in thi3 State endenvors have been
made to rouse the t assions of the inflamma
tory A. P. A's against the Catholics. If reli
gious riots have not taken place in this. City
it is not the fault of Drs. Case, Goodwin, Dllle
and Hovsrd.
This b.gotry strikes at the foundation of the
Republic, for it makes possible a religious war.
Even if that should not take place it ke x ps
many of the people divided into two hostile
camps, and a house divided is weakened
against a toreign foe.
I wish here to warn all Americans against
the intrigui g policy of England and her Ju
das Chamberlain. There has been no one
dei-per implicated in tbe Armenian massacres
thau he. The very agents that Chamberlain
is using to keep Ireland divided and from
giiinlng her independence are being employed
here to disrupt this Republic. They are the
Orangemen and their kindred.
I wish also to ask Americana to frown down
In the future every manifestation of religious
bigotry. Coming generations implore us not
to hand down to them the heritage of religious
dissention.
The next danger Is that of political corrup
tion. I see that the letter of Archbishop Ire
land has drawn down on him much abuse.
Had he known the nature of that abuse he
would probably have hesitated. I see that he
was assailed by a Dr. Derrickâ whether a horse
doctor or a chiropodist I don't know. Arch
bishop Ireland is the peer of any man in this
State to-day.
Our political system here is deeply tainted.
Our prlmnries have become a disgrÂ»ceful by
word. Respectable citizens stay away from
tl^em and It aye them to the control of the dis
reputable politicians. The conventions foist
candidates upon tlie public who are not fit to
hold a plow, mucn less an office.
Before the adoption of the Australian bal
lot system our elections were foul, drunken
orgies. The polls were controlled by unjailed
feions and some of the voters were sure to be
beaten by paid bullies. But the Australian
ballot does not secure the desired effect. It is
too complicated. Corrupt politicians hÂ«ve got
around the ballot. By means of a corrupt board
on the inside and intriguers on the outside
the will of the people is defeated.
Within a few years an organization has
sprung up to fumigate the polls â the Ameri
can Protective Association. Its primary object
is the total extinction of Catholics. Its secona
object is to purify politics. Its leaders are
among the greatest criminals that curse crea
tion to-day. They are stemm'.rg the tide of
corruption by selling their votes to the high
est bidder.
The citizen who sells his vote should be dis

franchised, and he who buys it should be
forever debarred from office. The corporation
that dares to interfere in politics snould be
dissolved by an angry people, and the million
aire who opens his money bags at election
time should have his property confiscated.
Although the people let this wrongdoing go
on for awhile they eventually rise In their
might and stamp it out. "In God We Trust" is
our National motto, and with the assistance of
the Almighty the safety and perpetuity of the
Republic is asssured.
WHY HE WAS STRUCK
Aftermath of the fracas in George
Davis* Fruit*tore on I>eavea
worth Street.
The fracas at the fruitstore of George
Davis, 220]4 Leavenworth street, Tuesday
night, when a revolver was discharged,
has led to serious trouble for Davis.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Katharina
Coifits, 220 Leavenworth street, swore to a
complaint in Judge Joachimsen's court
for the arrest of Davis on a charge of of
fensive conduct toward Edna Kelly, a
little girl 5 years of age. Davis was ar
rested and booked at the City Prison, and
a few hours later another charge of ex
hibiting a deadly weapon was registered
against him.
The man who struck Davis Tuesday
night was William Barrett, who lives
above Davis' store, and the reason why he
struck was because of his off- nsive con
duct toward tbe little girl, who is Bar
rett's niece.
Barrett was arrested on a complaint
sworn to by Davis charging him with bat
tery and was released on bail. Barrett
will this morning swear to a complaint
charging Davis with assault with a deadly
weapon, as he says he can prove that
DaviÃ' revolver was not accidentally dis
charged, but on the contrary that Davis
fired the shot at him.
REORGANIZE THE BOARD,
Request of the People's Home
Bank Depositors to the
Commissioners.
Directors Who Have No Interest in
the Wrecked Concern Will Be
Asked lo Resign.
Since the court has not granted the re
lief asked by th- associated depositors of
the People's Home Savings Bank an ef
fort has been made to reorganize the
board of directors of that institution.
Some directors who have no interest in
the bank have determined to resign and
thus be rid of the many annoyances asso- j
ciated with their office. They are slow,
however, in carrying tbeir determination
into effect, and lor that reason the at
torneys, Messrs. Gunnison, Booth and
Bartnett, representing depositors, have
sent the following letter to the Bank Com
missioners requesting tliem to reorganize
the bank's directory:
To the Honorable the Board of Bank Commis
sioner* of the State of California, San Francisco, ,
â¢ a/.â Gentlemen: We inclose you herewith 1
the opinion oi the Hon. J. M. feeawell, Jud^e ;
of our Superior Court, in the proceeding
brought by the California Sale Deposit aud I
Trust Company against S. K. Thornton and j
others, t^e suid proceeding having been in
stituted in that certain action entitied the I
People of the State of California, etc., vs. the I
People's Home Savings Ba:ik.
The opinion, while not approving certain of j
the acts ot the mannger and officers of said i
bank, nevertheless is|adverseto the conten- '
tions made by us. At tl>e close of the argu
ment of Mr. Carpenter, thf counsel (or de
fendants in this proceeding, he made the
statement to the court that certain of his cli
ents, who were defendants in this action, had
no interest in the bank and Intended to resign
from the directory, but that they did not deem
it judicious to retire in the face of these pro
ceedings. We have had the promise of at least
one of your honorable Commissioners that an
effort would be made to reorganize the direc
tory of said bank in such a way a: to give the
depositors a representation on tne board. We
are of the opinion that such a step would be in ]
the interest of all interested in said bank.
We therefore respectfully direct the atten- '
tiou of your honorab.e boara to this matter, '
and ask that you cive it such attention as in â 
your opinion the importance of the matter
demands. Respectfully submitted,
Gunnison, Booth & Bartnett,
Attorneys for the California Safe Deposit
and Trust Company.
The attorneys take a cheerful view of ;
the situation "and say that one Commis
sioner promised to reorganize the People's
Bank management so that depositors
would have a representation on the board
of directors. This desired chance would
place the banKs affairs in control of men
whose money is at stake.
Great expectations are held by the ex
ecutive committee of the depositors that a
dividend of 15 or 20 per cent will be de- ,
dared next January, provided that the
Los Angeles street railways are purchased .
by the English syndicate represented by
Charles Butters. The bank is heavily in
terested in bonds of these consolidated
lines.
Debate Upon the New Charier.
A debate upon the new charter has been ar- '
ranged to take place next Monday evening at
Turn Verein Hall, 323 Turk street. Professor
HenrySengerof the University of Caliiornia i
has consented to preside, and F. W. Dohr
mann, president of tbe Merchants' Association, i
will speak upon the affirmative, and Emil â 
Liess, editor of the Tageblatt, will speuk upon \
the negative. As both parties aie thoroughly ,
conversant with all the provisions of the new \
charter it is expected that the debate will
prove interesting and instructive.

COLLECTOR WISE REVERSED.
Trouble Among Those Interested in
the Mount Eden Leads to Inter
esting Results.
Collector of the Port Wise has just re
ceived from the Treasury Department a
decision in a case recently submitted
to the Washington authorities which will
be of great interest to snip-owners ana
the masters of vessels, touching as it does
the business status of the two when the
masters are part owners of the vessels
under their command.
F. H. J. Petermann and Nicolai Moller
are each half-owners in the steamer
Mount Eden, tha former as managing
owner and the latter as master. Some
months ago they quarreled and Peter
mann as managing owner dismissed Mol
ler and appointed Richard EL Barron in
his place.
Holler appealed the matter to the Col
lector of the Port, and Mr. Wise decided
that Petermann bad kept within his
rights, and was justified from a legal
point of view in dismissing Moiler. The
latter entered a formal protest against the
action and lodged it with the Collector,
who sent it to Washington. The result
was the following opinion, which is final
unless the matter is taken into court :

half-owners of the steamer, Petermann being
named in the outstanding papers as managing
owner. Tne latter tiled a written notice that
he had appointed Richard E. Barron as master
in plnce =>f Nicolai Moller. Barron took the
oath, and you indo.-sed his name as master.
Moller claims, in his written protest, that he
was not aware a change was being made; that
you had no authority "to make a change";
that he and Petermann had agreed that the
latter should attend to the shore business and
Holler be master, and that he served as such
from July 1, 1893, to the time of his displace
ment.
The department notes your statement that
if the complainant had filed protest prior to
the change being made, or if he had served
written notice on your office not to make the
change, it would not have been made unless
you had been otherwise instructed; that your
office cannot know of personal difficulties be
tween owners of vessels, and can act in such
cases ouly as the managing owner requests,
without regard to private agreements existing
between the various owners of the vessel, and
you report, therefore, that you cannot see that
your office acted in any manner contrary to
"law, justice and equity."
Prior to April, 1872, a master could be dis
possessed under the circumstances of the
present case, except by due process of law,
and the act of Congress of that date merely
authorized such dispossession by a majority of
the owners, and not then if there was an
agreement dated prior to April 19, 1872, by
virtue of which he had possession as part
owner, unless by action of a court of compe
tent jurisdiction.
The department holds that Moller was not
lawfully dispossessed; that on the presenta
tion of the vesse.'s documents he should be
permitted to take the requisite oath, and
that thereupon the change should be indorsed
by the customs officers, as th ; law and regula
tions prescribe (section 4171, R. S.). Any de
cree ot a competent court, however, should be
duly observed.
Please take action accordingly. Respectfully
yours, S. Wike, Assistant Secretary.
SHARKEY'S PRESENT.

Tom Sharkey, the champion pugilist of
Uncle Sam's navy, was presented with a

stating that he would be always proud to
be the possessor of such a beautiful token
of esteem, and that as a pugili-t he hoped
that tne time was close at hand when the
stick will be handled by the champion
heavy-weight of the world.
On tne head of the cane is engraved:
"Tom from his snipmates of the U. S. 8.

The officers of the Republican campaign

night made a mistake vrhen they engaged
the Auditorium as the place for the rally.
It was much too small, several hundred

persons having been obliged to stand
against the wall in the rear, not to speak
of the crowd that was not able to get in
at all.
Notwithstanding the large crowd in the
building the best of order prevailed. It
was an enthusiastic, jubilant audience,
quick to appreciate the telling points in
tne speeches and generous in its encour
agement of its speakers. It was aroused
to a great pitch of enthusiasm when the
Phoenix Club Drill Corps and the drill
corps of the Thirty-fifth District entered
the building inarching after rife and drum
and carrying torches and transparencies.
Ex-Congressman W. 11. 11. Stowell of
Minnesota was interrupted twice in his
peech by the entrance of the uniformed
Republicans, and once by the audience
rising to its feet and cheering William A.
Deane, Republican candidate for Auditor,
when he took his seat on the platform.
The speaker took the interruptions good
naturedly, and to enjoy those
spontaneous outbursts of Republican en
thusiasm.
Mr. Stowell is a fine looking man, ap
parently abcut 45 years of age, and he
made his hearers catch their breath when
he announced that he was approaching
his sixtieth year. He has a remarkably
sweet and persuasive voice, with very dis
tinct articulation.
When J. Alva Walt, who acted as chair
man of the meeting, walked to the speak
er's stand he was greeted with a cordial
hand-clapping that was only an earnest of
what was to come from the houre later In
the evening.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "it
affoids me great pleasure to meet yon here j
to-night, for we meet not only in the in
terest of the Republican National ticket,
about which we are each and every one
most enthusiastic, but also in the interest
of the local ticket, which has already re
ceived the unanimous indorsement of the
people of San Francisco.
"Tnis meeting ia the inspiration of â¢
i moment. It was gotten up without seri
ious and careful consideration, but rather
as an outburst of loyalty to the principles
for which we are all lighting together and
of enthusiasm over the issues of the day.
And yet 1 see before me as large and as
enthusiastic an audience as ever met to do
honor to the Republican party in this City.
I will further say :hat there are many
other enthusiastic maÂ«s-meeting3 of Re
publicans in San Francisco to-night, else
this hall would be altogether too small to
contain the crowds that would throng
round the doors for admission.
"You will Fee here later on the various
uniform clubs of the City after they have
attended the other gathering?.
"Now it is my pleasure to introduce to
yon one of the war horses of the Repub
can party, the Hon. \V. H. H. Stowel! of
Minnesota. He has been one of the true
men who have been supporting party
principles and fighting for party and
country in Congress for many years. Be
fore further trespassing on your time I will
introduce him to you." The house ap
plauded loudly as Mr. Stowell stepped for
ward and bowed lm acknowledgments.
Mr. Stowell said:
"Mr. Chairman and ladies and gentle
men: I certainly must return my thanks
to you tor this very cordial r rception,
which, while it is equally flattering to me
as an individual. I cannot take to myself
in any measure, for I am a stranger to
you, and I know that your enthusiasm is
not tor me, but for the cause which we
hay* so much at hear.
"I am well nigh on to 60 years of age,
and it has been twelve or fifteen years
since I made a speech until I mnde one
about a week ago in your City. I never
expected again to take part in any politi
cal campaign, but when I saw and heard a
great public party put a falsehood at the
base of its platform and build up all of its
arguments upon that falsehood, I felt it
was my duty as one of the participants in
the act of 1873, to defend it from the as
persions that had been cast upon it. [Ap
plause.]
"This has been in the East a campaign
of bate and of falsehood, i have been in
your midst only about ten days, having
been called here because of sickness in my
family, and up to the time 1 left the East
we have had the most remarkable cam
paign that has ever existed in American
politics and the most importanfeampaign
since 18G1. I say that this has been a
campaign largely of hato and misrepre
sentation.
"I mate that assertion because the mov
ing spirits in the Chicago convention were
Tillman of South Carolina and Altgeld of
Illinois, and the only appeal and the only
argument that Senator Tillman used in
the earlier days of the campaign was to
array section against section. The only
arcument used by Governor Altgeld in the
earlier part of the campaign was to array
class against class and the clatses against
the masses.
"In order to show that their- platform
was founded upon misrepresentation, I
will read from the platform itself, so that
you can see that 1 do not misstate it:
"We declare that the act of 1873, demonetiz
ing silver without the knowledge or approval I
of the American people, has resulted In the ap- i
preciation of gold and a corresponding fall In I
the prices of commodities produced by the j
people ; a heavy increase in the burden of tax- I
ailou and of all debts, public and private; the
enrichment of the money-lending class at
home and abroad; the prostration of industry
and the impoverishment of the people.
"Now, there are two misstatements in
that. In the first place, the act of 1873
was not passed in secrecy and in fraud.
As I happened to be a member of Congress
from 1871 to 1877 and was in Coneress
when that act was passed, and voted for
it with a full knowledge of what it con
tained. I think that I am a living witness
of the falsehood of that platform which
has been the basis of their whole cam
paign. [Applause.]
"I remember tne day that bill passed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1896.
the House, and the day it was discussed
In the House, just as well as 1 remember
this scene before me to-night, and the rea
son I remember it so well is because Sam
uel Hooper, who was chairman of ihe
Committee on Coinage ana Weights and
Measures, was a man whom I personally
knew and respected."
Here Mr. Stowell was interrupted by the
entrance of a drill corps. "I yield to su
perior noise," he said, amid laughter.
After the applause had subsided Mr.
Stowell proceeded:
'*So, I left my seat, he being a man of
threescore and ten years, and not speak
ing very distinctly, in onler that I might
be nearer him so as to hear what he was
saying."
"I propose three cheers for the Thirty
fifth District Club," shouted James Alva
Watt.
The cheers were given with a will and
the drill corps responded with cheers for
! McKinley. Mr. Stowell went on:
"After our Government was formed in
1792 one of the first things brought under
consideration was the question of money,
and after very careful deliberation Hamil
ton and Jefferson, who were the two lead
ing spirits on different sides of the party,
agreed upon a basi* of value between
gold ana silver at 15 to 1. It happened
that at that 4ime all the other nations of
the world were on a basis of 15}^ to 1, and
have remained there ever since, nearly all
of them.
"Now, what happened? The man who
had a pound of gold took it to France and
wouid get fifteen and a half pounds of sil
ver for it. He put a half pound of silver
into his pocket, took the fifteen pounds to
the United States and had it coined into
dollars, and with these dollars he bought
another pound of gold, which he took to
France and sold lor iif:ceu and a half
pounds of silver. Then he put the half
pound into his pocket and went througii
the same performance againâ a kind of
perpetual motion in finance. [Laughter
and applause.]
"In ISQG Thomas Jefferson by his own
executive act put a stop to the free coin
age of silver, as you mignt call it, and
from that time on there was no silver
coined in this country to speak of. In 1834,
under the Presidency of Andrew Jackson,
another tolerably good Democrat, al
though of course he didn't know as much
as Mr. Bryan [laughter] and under the
leadership of Tnomas Benton in the Sen
ate they changed the ratio from 15 to 1 to
1G to 1.
"Then what happened? Just the re
verse would take placp. A man wouid
bring the gold into trie United States and
the silver would go to France and the rest
of Europe and we were practically on a
goid basis and remained so and no silver
was coined because silver was worth more
than gold in the United States.
'â¢Then when the war came on the coin
age of both go!d and silver was sus
pended. From 1834 on. all the silver was
driven out of the country. In 18G7, soon
after the war ended, the leading states
men of the country cÂ«me to the conclu
sion that they wouid better tako time by
the forelock and codify the laws and the
monetary system. B?fore that time all
the mints in this country were running
independently, and it was proposed to
bring all the different mints and assay
offices under one bureau in Washington,
and to codify all the laws that had been
passed and make a new system of coinage.
"For this purpose an international com
mission met at Paris, Mr. Ruegles being
the American Commissioner. The object
in view was to establish a uniform coin in
weight and fineness. For instance, the
pound sterling is worth about Â§4 8(3 in our
money, because it has just that weight and
fineness. The idea was to have the pound
sterling and the half eagle and the 20-franc
French piece to contain just the same
quantity of gold â to be of the same weignt
and finenessâ so that they might circulate
everywhere in the world; but that com
mission failed.
"J. J. Knox of Minnesota.who was Deputy
Comptroller of the Currency, presented a
bill to Mr. Boutwell, Secretary ol the
Treasury, together with a volume contain
ing the testimony of experts from all over
the world on that subject. That bill pro
vided lor the dropping of the standard
dollar of 4121^ grains free coinage, and it
dropped the 5 cent and 3 cent silver pieces,
and in all the discussions that took place
in Congress there was no argument what
ever against the dropping of the standard
silver dollar. On the other hand, every
member that spofce upon the question â
about tweDy-eight members of the House
and seventeen Senatorsâ said that that
was the proper thing to do, and that the
gold-dollar should be the unit of measure.
"There were a few men in Congress who
thought t hut tue creation of a new bureau
and the appointment of a few extra men
to oifice might increase the expenses of the
Government, ana they objected. There
was quite a discussion as to the number of
giains of silver that should be put into the
dollar that was finally adopted. The first
proposition was to make the dollar 384
grains, instead of 412, and the reason for
that was that^silver was worth more than
goid, and they wanted to put just enough
silver in so as to make it pretty nearly the
value of a dollar, and ."till make U under
weight, so that it would not be melted up
into silver spoons.
"Another set of men who were from the
Pacific Coast said that we had recently
concluded a treaty with China, and that
we were trying to build up a trade with ;
China and Japan and Mexico, and for that
reason they Wanted the dollar to contain
420 grains and to use it as a trade dollar,
and nave it limited as a legal tender, and
that was the dollar that was finally
adopted. That dollar was of full free and
unlimited coinage.
"During the eighty years from 1792 to
1873 the Government coined 8.000,000
standard dollars, and from 1373 to 1878
35,000,000 of trade dollars were coined.
"That bill was recommended by the
Secretary of tli6 Treasury in 1869-70, and
it was before Congress five different ses
sions. It was brought up in the Senate
for consideration four times in the second
session of the Forty-first Congress and
nine times in the House, and in the third
session of the Forty-first Congres:s ten
times in the Senate and eight times in the
House; in the second session of the
Forty-second fourteen times in the House
and eight times in the Senate, and in the
third session of the Forty-second twelve
times in tbe Senate and fourteen times in
the House. It was before the two houses
of Congress seventy-nine times in three
years.
"I got these data more particularly from,
the files of t:>e Congiessional Record in
the Public Library in this City. There is
not a free-silver country in the world that
has a free public library. [Continued ap
plause.]
"The discussion upon the question oc
cupied sixty-six columns in tue Congres
sional Record in the Senate, participated
in by seventeen Senators. The debates in
the House, participated in by twenty
eight members, occupied seventy-eicut
columns, and quite a large portion of that
discussion was taken up by Senators Nye
ana Stewart of Nevada, by Corbett and
Williams of Oregon and Cole and Casserly
of California.
"So you can see how much secrecy there
was in this debate."
The speaker said that he could not be
lieve that such a man would father a
fraud.
The sneaker was given a grand ovation
as ho retired after reciting a patriotic ad
aress to the Union. The applause was
loud and most cordial and it was some
time before the band took the place of this
uproar with an inspiring air.
Ed I. Wolfe, candidate for State Sena
tor, was then introduced as the next
speaker of the evening. He said he felt
he was in a rather awKward position, hav
ing Deen preceded by the eloquent gentle
man from the P2ast and Colonel Eddy oi"
the West was ready to follow him.
"I agvee with the gentleman who pre
ceded me," said Mr. Wolfe, "that the real
issue now confronting us is how many
dollars we can put each day into the
pockets of American workingmen. It has
been truthfully said this is a campaign of
education, and the people will wholly de
cide the questions that have arisen; and
the last four years' experience under Dem
ocratic administration will teach us in
California to vote for McKinley and Ho
bart and protection to American indus
tries and for prosperity to the Nation.
[Cheers.]
"There is but one issue in this cam
paign â protection to American industries.
[Applause.] The speaker has said that
California nad a fii;ht against the bar
barism of Asia, that the mighty moun
tains of the Pacific Coast suggested to
him the idea of a providential barrier
agaiust the Asiatic hordes. You all well
remember the slogan of a few years ago
when this whole coast rose up and cried
with one vo:ca, 'Tne Chinese must go!'
We all know how party was sunk then on
that question, and we all were a unit on
tiiat right; and 1 ask y%m now, what is
the difference if we throw down the bar
riers of protection and allow the goods
manufactured in Asia to come into this
glorious land in competition with the
product of free American labor, and still
keep up barriers against the people of the
Orient?
Mr. Wolfe was given a parting cheer in
recognition of his eloquent defense of Re
publican principles and of the honor of
the party. In conclusion, he appealed to
the house for its support of himself in his
campaign for State Senator.
Colonel C. L. Taylor, the nominee Tor
Mayor, was received with applause when
introduced. He thanked the house for the
hearty greeting, and said he expected the
votes of all present, and their assistance
also, and further remarked that he left it
to themselves to say whether he had done
his duty in the last two years. Anyhow,
he gave his assurance that if elected Mayor
he will do his duty to the best of his
ability.
"Talk of the boy orator of the Platte.
but," the chairman said, "Bryan was not
in it with the young orator of the Pacilic
Coast, Hon. T. V. Eddy." The Phcenix
Club yelled cheers for their president, and
Mr. Eddy explained that there was evi
dently some mistake. He was not run
ning for office, but had the honor to be
president of this grand republican club.
"My friends, I bring yougreeting from,
the interior of California and that is Mc-
Kinley is going to b* elected President of j
the United States, and that California is i
going to give him her vote. The people o*
thiscommonvealth havegrown tired of the
last four years of misrule, four yeais of
bitter experience to America. The people
are sick aud tired of the prophecies of this
young man who is going about speaking
from the platform of a Pullman car leav
ing a blaze of oratory behind him all
across the country. '"Wheat will go to
$1 50 a bushel, the workinEmen will have
money and be happy,' he said four years
ago. I don't like to say he is a liar, but
che experience of the last four years dem
onstrates that his prophecy was false.
"Now this orator has got a new medi
cine; he gave us a dosa of free trade some
time ago; now it is free silver. What will
he give us next?"
"Free lunch," came from the hall.
"That's right," added the speaker.
"Free soup, and there will have to be
some mighty hard scratching. I'm afrairi,
to get free sounif they give us free silver."
A' glowing tribute was paid by the
speaker to California's intelligence, man
hood and honor, and consequently the
State should be at the top of the colnmn
on November 3 and so be a brilliant star
in the galaxy of States that will support
McKinley, under whose banner it is glori
ous to march.
Turning to the local Republican ticket
Mr. Eddy said he hoped every man on it
would be elected to office. Any man who
would split the party in this campaign
when so much depends upon the weal or
woe of the party is not a good Republican
at heart. [Loud and prolonged applause.]
He added he never did train v/ith any one
but straight lie publicans and he never will.
While he did not know all the candidates
personally ne declared that the nomina
tion in itself on a Republican ticket was a
sufficient guarantee of en aracter. Colonel
Taylor whs complimented for his reputa
tion in public and private life.
William Deane's name set the audience
and particularly the uniformed clubs wild,
and cheers were given for thenominee for
Auditor. "If there is any cutting of Re
publicans' salaries to be done, let it be
done by a Republican and a good fellow,"
remarked the speaker when the applause
subsided.
George W. Elder, nominee for Superin
tendent of Streets, and John Aitken, for
District Attorney ; the Superior Judges,
Carroll Cook, Judge Finn, Judge Hunt,
Judge Bonestell, were spoken ol in very
complimentary terms. Tne nominees for
Police Judges and the Legislature were
mentioned.
"I want to know in the name of all that
is goodâ do you want Cator?" asked the
speaker.
"No!" shouted some one in the audi
ence.
"Do you want a Democrat?"
"No."
"Whom do you want?"
"A Republican."
"Yes, you want a Republican, because
in the next Senate you want a man who
will stand by McKinley. Then, when
California has given her electoral vote to
McKialey, you will have done your whole
duty.
"My friend?, our political opponents are
losing heart. They see their strength
fading away from them from day to day.
and now there is nothing left to them or
in them but noise. They would not
belong to Bryan's party if they
dia not make noise. They remind me
of a steamboat on the Mississippi
that had a three-horsepower engine and a
seven-horse whistle and whenever the
captain wanted to whistle he had to stop
the boat. It took more power to blow the
whistle than to run the boat, it is the
same with these free-silver curbstone ora
tors. When you hear them speaking about
1G to 1 you'd think that the National.
Guard of California was turned loosseupou
the streets. To go into a discussion of the
free-silver question is worse than foolish;
it is not needed by men who have paid
any attention to the vital issues of the
campaign. I believe there are ene
mies of this tjreat free country going
about the land to-day. When men are
stirring up strife, preaching to the Nation
that man must stand up and light against
his fellow-man. I say that that man is no
friend of the Republic, lly friends, this
country has cost too much to preserve it
and hold it one; hundreds of thousands
of lives were lost on the Southern plains.
Shall it be said that this young man of
Nebraska shall preach a new dogma to the
people; this man scarce 36 years of aÂ«e,
who is not old enough to remember what
it cost to save this country ?
"Do you kuow that the women of this
country are for McKinley? [Applause.]
lean tell yon why. There is not a woman
in this land that would be afraid to trust
her little child in the hands of this good
man, Mr. McKinley; they know that he
is a good Christian gentleman who has
done his duty. And if these rood women
are willing to stand for McKinley, what
thanks is it for us poor rats to support
him?"
Mr. Eddy was cheered by the whole
audience as he closed in a burst of elo
quence, assuring his hearers that Cali
fornia would give McKinley a full vote,
and that the success of the Republican
party is certain.
Georee W. Eider said that his record for
the past two years was well known, and
he wanted the people to examine it. If
satisfactory he wanted their votes.
The chairman announced that the
meeting was at an end, and the large au
dience dispersed cheering for McKinley,
Hobart and protection.

The facts were stated briefly in ytster
â¢ day's Call. Clarke is the son of the senior
'member of the firm of Clarke & Bushnel),
wholesale grocers in New York, ode of the
wealthiest firms of the Kind on the conti
nent.
â¢ Some time ago young Clarke started on
' a trip around the world, being supplied

- young man and soon made hosts of
friends, with w"hom he spent his money
lavishly till a few weeks ago, when he
â¢ found himself short of funds.
The only one he knew in this City be
fore arriving here was Wheeler, and on
October 10 he went to him and presented
a draft for $250, which he had drawn ou |
bis father, asking him to get it cashed for j
him. Wheeler took the draft to J. A. ;
Foitrer & Co., wholesale spice and coffee !
merchants, and they honored it. Tuesday i

"It is a case of malicious prosecution,"
" said Clarke yesterday, "on the part of
Wheeler, and as soon a? I am released '
from custody I will soon straio-hten the I
matter out. Wheeler, I learned to-day i
â¢ from a friend, has an old grudpe aeainst '

"I have been guilty of no false pretenses, j

only explain why it was not honored by i
the fact that my father was out ot the city
and as it was the first time that 1 had drawn
on him, the firm did not honor the draft,
thinking perhaps there was something !
wrong. I have not wired to my parents
as I would not for the world let them
know that I was in prison, but I will do so
â¢ as soon as released.
"My attorney, R. Porter Ashe, is getting
bonds for tne and I expect to be out of j
here to-night."
The story told at the office of F. A.
Wheeler at 114 California street differs
very little from Clarke'.- version con
cerning the cashing of the draft. The
motives actuating Mr. Wheeler appear in
a very different li?ht. Mr. Wheeler is a
second cousin of Clarke. Mr. Wheeler's
purpose, so it was said at his office, was to
. do Clarke a favor in the matter of having
the draft cashed. When Clarke bad pos
session of the $250 he went out on the
street and soon made a hole in the cash,
.if the accounts current on California street
. are to be believed.
One statement is that he was soon
throwing dice for a $50 stake and that,
â' 'having lost, he repeated this experiment
once and perhaps more, with the same re
sult. Knowledge of this coming to Mr.
Wheeler, in connection with the subse
quent dishonorins of the draft, caused
him to lose sympathy with Clarke. It was
â¢ denied positively that he had any grudge
against Clarke.
Swallowed Carbolic Acid.
i Alfred G. Andrew, living at 1910 Larkln
(irtet, wa6 found dead in his bed yesterday
â jirning. The deceased had taken the poison
tWUi suicidal intent the day before, but it was
tiibugtt that he had fully recovered from its
' effects, hence no one was with him when
death came. Andrew has Deen subjected to a
series of misfortunes, which it seems affected
bis mind. Three months ago, after many
weeks oi idleness, he secured work, but on the
becond day an accident occurred whereby he
broke his leg. Finally he grew better and
thought himself able to resume work when he
was taken seriously ill. This last misfortune
bore so heavily upon him that on Tuesday
last he swallowed an overdose of carbolic acid.
-Mrs. Andrew is left with three small children
on her hands and is in very straitened circum
stances.
BASKET-BALL TEAMS
Sport That Will Be Witnessed in the
Gymnasium of the Christian
Association.
In connection with the "ladies' night"
in the Young Men's Christian Association
gymnasium this evening, a game of
basket-ball will be played between the
"Rushers" and the "Business Men's
Team." This is the second game in the
championship series.
The "Rushers" will place the following
men on the floor: Left forward, George
Klarman, captain; right, O. D. Eastwood;
left center, W. W. Harden; center, E.
Fleischer; right center, Fred L. Shaw;
left back, Wiliiam Mitchell; right, D.
Hanrahan.
The substitutes are : E. L. Spacher, R.
H. Marchant and L. L Edredge.
The "Business Men's Team" will line up
as follows: Left forward, F. M. Goodrich;
right forward, Louis Titus; leit center, C.
J. Anger; center, H. J. Biedrich Jr.; right
center, W. Wilson; left back, Chris Bern
hard; right back, F. J. Batzer; substi
tutes: J. A. Percy, P. T. Tompkins, C. T.
Pfarrer and H. B. Ward.
The score of the first game in the series
was 7 to 0 in favor of the "Rushers," but
the outlook for to-night's play favors- a
victory for the "Business Men" in view of
the strong team in line to-night. Anger,
Batzer, Diedrich and Titus are the strong
hold of this team. They were missing iv
the first game.
FIERCE WAR IS RAMPANT
An " Anti-Looting " Sign Nailed
to the Nucleus
Building.
American Women's Liberal League
vs. Non-Partisan Campaign
Committee.
An irrepressible conflict rages in the
Nucleus building, which is situated at the
southeast corner of Market and Third
streets, opposite the magnificent sixteen
story structure that is now being erected
for the new home of the San Francisco
Call.
The Nucleus is at this moment the
warmest place in the campaign, and un
less something is done to mollify the feel
ings of the excited contestants there is no
telling what may happen. The trouble
that rocks this solid structure "from tur
ret to loundation stone"' is between the
Citizens' Non-Partisan party and the
American Women's Liberal League.
Some time ago the two signs of these
two organizations blossomed out on the
outer walls of the Nucleus. One of the
signs read as follows:
i citizens' non-partisan headquarters ;
for the new charter â¢
: and â¢
GOOD GOVERNMENT. J
; LITERATURE FREE. :
BOOMS 12 AND 13. â 
Immediately adjoining was another
red and black placard bearing the legend:
j AMERICAN WOMEN'S LIBERAL LEAUUE. |
; ANTI-CHARTKK LITERATURE ;
â¢ free. â¢
: room 21.
There was some dispute as to the prior
ity of the banners, but at any rate the
Non-Partisans complained that the oppo
sition sign impinged upon their own
and led to confusion, as some persons
might think that the Non-Partisans wera
trying to carry water on both shoulders so
far as the charter was concerned.
Subsequent proceedings may be best
understood by the explanation which Miss
Morse, one of the ladies of the American
Women's Liberal League, gave yesterday.
"All this difficulty came about by Mr.
Clark, the manager for the owner of the
Nucleus, and Mr. Wallace, the agent, al
lowing themselves to bs bulldozed. We
had as much right to put out our sign as
the Non- Partisans had, and as we wanted
to advertise our anti-charter literature we
did so. When we first heard of the objec
tion to onr sign we paid no attention, and
settled our rent as usual when it was clue.
i A few minutes later we received notice to
take down our sign, but we did not heed
the command, as the Non- Partisans still
had up tneir banner.
''Then somebody came into our rooms at
night with passkeys and robbed us of our
sign. I went to Mr. Clark and told him
that I wanted him to tell me where our
sien had gone, as I intended to swear out
a search warrant. He said he would take
an oath before a notary public that he
didn't know anything about the where
abouts of our sign. I asked for permis
sion to put up a new sign, which he refused
because he said we had not obeyed his
orders about the other sign.
"As I stood in the door about to go I
said:
" 'Then you refuse to '-ive permission
for our sifn to go up again?'
" 'I do,' he said.
'â¢'Well, we'll nut it up, anyhow,' 1
replied; 'and I'd like to see anybody try
to take it down.'
"80 you see we have got a bigger sign
than ever â a sign that can't be looted by
taking it through our windows, and I
don't think anybody can got at it without
breaking his neck unless he has a nying
macliine: that's why we changed the let
tering, making it read, 'Anti-A. P. A..
Anti-Charter Literature Free â Anti-Loot
ing Made Easy.'
"We keep a watchman on thÂ« premises
all night, and we don't care if he hires a |
bulldog to bear him company in the loÃe
vigils of the night. One thing is certain;
we don't intend to take any more chances
on losing our sign."
Meanwhile the Non-Partisans are fol
lowing the example of Brer Rabbitâ they
are lying low ana saying nothing.

FLOORED BY CREICHTON.
The Weil-Known Politician Resents an
Insult to a Policeman.
Richard Creighton, the well-known
politician, was in Judge Campbell's court
yesterday morning when a witness in a
case used an offensive expression in regard
to a policeman who was not present.
When the witness left the court Creigh
ton followed him into the corridor and
asked him if he meant what he said. The
man replied that he did, and wanted to
know if Creighton would take up the
policeman's fight. Creighton promptly
threw out his right hand, which struck
the man on the jaw, knocking him down.
Policeman E. J. Thompson, who was in
the corridor, arrestid Creighton for bat

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1896.
THE COWS MUST
ALL BE WASHED
And Milkmen Must Take
an Occasional Bath
as Well.
Some New Dairy Rules Framed
by the Board of
Health.
CATTLE MUST BE TAGGED.
They Will Have to Wear Certificates
of Character Conspicuously
Displayed.
The Board of Health adopted its long
heralded regulations for the milkmen
yesterday ana ordered them posted in
conspicuous places about the City.
As the enforcing of the new rules would
necessitate the employing of 200 or 300
inspectors in addition to those now in the
department it is likely that they will not
be very closely observed, but they showed
the inclination of the board. The rules
are ai follows:
Cows must be kept in well-ver.tilated stables,
having at least 600 cubic feet of air spacu for
each cow.
Cows will be tagged with the tag of the
Health Department. Said tag must not be re
moved except by the chief inspector of this
department.
If it is desired to remove the cow from the
stable the chief inspector of foods at the Healtn
Department must be notified, aud the cow
must not be removed until tiie owner is au
thurized to do so in writing.
Cows that have beeu examined and tagged
by this department must not be kept in sta
bles with other animal* or cows not tagged.
Manure must be removed and stable cleaned
one hour before milkine. The floor and stalls
must be sprinkled with water just before milk
ing commences.
The teats and tag of cows ana the hands of
those engaged In milking must be washed and
well dried before milktng commences.
The utensils must be washed with boiling
water containing soda, soup or some alkali,
an<l then with boiling water before using.
The milk must be strained through a fine
sieve, then placed in a cooler and cooled to a
temperature of at leas-t 50 degrees Fahrenheit
before offering for sale.
(Note.â During cooling the cooler must be
tightly covered with a piece of tine net to keep
out dust.)
There must be no changes in the care of cows
or in the amount or quality of food supply or
in the hours of watering, quality and source of
water, except by order of the Chief Inspector.
Secretary L. R. Mead of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association sent in
a communication calling attention to tne
fact that the association was about to take
energetic steps toward the promotion of
home industries in California, and asking
that a committee of three be appointed
from the Board of Health to confer with
committees from the other bureaus of the
City in regard to tiie necessary steps to be
taken. The communication was placed
on file and Drs. Morse, Williamson and
Fitzgibbon wera appointed a committee to
atteud the conference.
MINERS' CONVENTION.
Very Ijnrge Delegat onft Expected From'
tiie Country Associations.
Great preparations are being made for
the California Miners' Association Con
vention which will be held in this City on
November 10. From all reports every
county organization will double the num
ber of its delegates over last year and
then there were 300 delegates.
It is expected that the miners will re
elect Jacob H. Neff as the president of the
association, although he is very anxious to
shift the responsibilities upon the shoul
ders of some other well-known mining
man. From all accounts there will be a
spirited contest for the vice-presidency.
The executive committee has been so for
tunate as to secure a one and a third rate
for the round trip for delegates on all of
the railroads.
The principal business to come before
the convention will be the Dreparation of
a measure for the creation of a Cabinet of
ficer on mines and mining.
Yesterday Julian Sonntag received a
letter from the Santa Clara Mining Asso
ciation at New Almaden stating that the
organization had elected Charles C. Derby
as president, Ellard W. Carson as secre
tary and Robert R. Bulmore as treasurer.
These three officers, with Richard Pearce
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
and Thomas Wasley, will serve as dele
gates to the big convention.
Mr. Sonntag has appointed George A.
Tomb, A. McLauirhlin and S. H. Tacy as
delegates from the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, that organization
having been prominently identified in the
same interests as the Miners' Association.

A REHEARING WANTED.
Buckley Democrats Looking to the
Campaign of 1898.
D. A. Macdonald, the Buckley candidate
for Superintendent of Public Streets, has
filed in the Supreme Court a petition for a
rehearing or new trial of the case of D. A.
Macdonald vs. W. M. Hinton, the Regis
trar of this City and County. The peti
tioner is very anxious to be placed am ong
the candidates on the regular Democralic
ticket, but Registrar Hinton denied his
petition and the case was carried to the
Supreme Court, which sustained the de
c'sion of the Registrar.
In his petition for a rehearing or a new
trial in the case the petitioner's numerous
attorneys set forth:
That there was a misapprehension on the
part of the court in making the order on mo
tion of judgment on the pleadings in this,
that said order was made final and went to the
extent of denying the writ and dismissing the
petition, when it should nave only denied the
motion for judgment on the pleadings and set
the matter for trial on the issues of fact raised
upon the record. * * * The statutes gov
erning the remedy by mandate expressly pro
vide for the trial of issues of fact either before a
court or referee. We respecUally submit that
it Is unjust to allow the respondent to make
up a case of facts. The respondent can under
such practice bind a petitioner by any denials
or statements of fact, limited only by the
bounds set by an elastic conscience.
We earnestly invoko the attention of the
court to the gravity of the case. Nothing can
be bo important as the political rights of a
great number of voters constituting a party or
ganization. The very existence of an organ
ization numbering thousands of voters and its

RAINED BLOWS IN
A RESTAURANT
Attorneys Kenny and New
berger Were the
Principals.
Newberger Made a Disparaging
Remark About Judge
Conlan.
KENNY CHOSE TO RESENT IT.
Judge Campbell Was an Interested
Spectator of the Rough-and-
Tumble Fight.
The local political campaign for the po
sition of Police Judges was the cause of a
lively scrap between two attorneys yester
day.
At the lunch hour several attorneys
were in a restaurant on Larkin street, op
posite the City Hall. Judge Campbell
was seated at one table with Attorney A.
Newberger and two or three others. At
an adjoining table was seated Attorney
John J. Kenny and some friends.
In the course of conversation Judge
Campbell complained that Kenny was
fighting against his election. Kenny re
plied that although he liked the Judge so
cially he objected to him as a dispenser of
justice.
Just then Newberger chimed in with a
disparaging remark about Judge Conlan
and Kenny promptly resented it.
"When you made the same remark to
me yesterday," said Kenny, "I told you
you were a liar and warned you not to re
peat it. You wouldn't come outside now
and repeat it to my face."
Kenny bad by this time risen to his
feet and Newberger as he repeated the re
mark ros>e also, and Kenny shot out his
right, which landed on Newberger's nose.
To save himself from another jab New
berger clinched. There was no referee to
make them back away and they hugged
each other till they both landed upon the
floor and rolled underneath the table.
The fought viciously on the floor, and
although Newberger is much heavier and
taller than Kenny, the latter got in the
most blows, but failed to reach New
berger's face.
At the start of the fight the lunch eaters
simply looked surprised, but when the two
attorneys fell to the floor locked in each
other's embrace, they jumped to their feet
and a rush was made to get a close view
of the fight.
Two or three, thinking that hostilities
had been allowed to go far enough, pulled
the struggling attorneys apart, and they
soon recovered their breath and their
temper and brushed the dust from their
clothes. No blood was drawn.
"Judge Conlan," said Kenny afterward,
"is a personal friend of mine, and I will
not allow a man like Newberger to vilify
him when he is not present to defend him
self. If the same remark had been made
about any other of my personal friends I
would have* done the same thing, no
matter how big the man was who made
the remark."
The police were not informed of the
fight and uo arrests were made.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth!),
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure: Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hich" means high tarometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us' ally 'first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
â  the pressure falling to the California cobs'- warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
will produce an opposite result.
WEATHER BUREAU REPORT.
United Statks Department of Ageicpl
tcbe, Weather Bureau, San' Fbaxcisco, Oct.
21, 1896, 5 p. x.â Weather conditions and general

ditions are ex pecte.l Thursday night as far south

above 1500 or 2000 feet elevation. Light rain ha*
fallen todaÂ» in Western Montana, Idaho and

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Ita.. Oct. 22.â Wheat wasn't worth
so much by several cents to-day es it was jester
day or the day before. After carefully studying
the cables and the Information from Â£an Francisco
this morning some of the big holders concluded to
secure a portion of the rrotii3 already credited to
them on paper. This proceeding necessitated the
selling out of large quantities of wheat, and, as the
short interest in the inarkf t is notably small, the
offerings greatly exceeded the demand, to the det
riment of prices.
Liverpool cables were 1% 10 2d higher, repre
senting only sympathy with ojr strength of yes
terday, San Francisco closing weak yesterday,
showing waning enthusiasm at that place. He
celpts were 349 cars at Chicago and 11.750 bus!ir> s
were taken from ntorf. TliÂ» Northwest had 985
cars, against 867 last Wednesday and 933 a year
ago. Bradstreei's reported an increase in the
world's available supply of 6.064,0^0 bushels.
Closing continental cables were irregular, but
no excitement was indicated In any of the foreuu
markets. Experts were 3-13.900 bushels. The
last few moments were panicky, offerings becm
ing enormous and the disposition to buy corre
spondingly backward. The lowest quotations of
the day were then established. Decemoer wheat
opened from 77% cto 77ygC, declined toYSy B e,
closing at 751,4 c. 3ygc undÂ»r yesterday. Esti
mated receipts tor to-iiiorr.'W 239 cars.
CORNâ The weak position of corn was demon
strated by the rapidity with which pr ces dropped
when deprived of ihe supporting power of wheat.
Local specula' ors whu had DOtiglit on th"- assump
tion thai values were certain to rise by the assist
ance obtained from the leading market were sellers
on to-day's bmak. Liverpool cables were 141 lower
to 1 id nuttier. Receipts were 839 cars and 612.881
bushels wcr- taken from store.. F.xi-ort clear
ances amounted to 380 409 bushels. Brads'.rect's
gave an increase in stocks of V, 7*0,01,0 bushels.
May corn opened at 3 ,ic, declined to 'i77.se,
where it closed is/ c under yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 705 cars. - â¢
OATSâ Like corn, havlug ascended through sym
pathy with wheat, was naturally affected unfavor
ably* by the general ' weakness existing in other
parts of the room. Becelpts were 418 cars. There
were no withdrawals from store. Bradstreet'a re
ported an increase in slocks of 792,000 bushels.

Board of Trade Will Act
on Colonel Bridges'
Report
The System Governing Golden
Gate Park to Be Closely
Followed.
NEED OF A BOND ELECTION.
The Engineer Says That 0 kland Can
Easily H ye Baautifnl
Boulevards-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 21. j
It now seems probable that this city will
have some public parks. The efforts of
the Board of Trade and the City Council
were shown to-day in the report of the
joint committee.
The report recommends that bonds be
issued to acquire by purchase or condem
nation the necessary realty. It proceeds:
We also recommend that the entire care,
control and management of said park or pe.rks
be vested in a Board of Park Commissioners of
five in number (whose services shall be ren
dered gratuitously), the first commission to be
nominated or chosen in the manner deemed
expedient by you.
We would also suggest that we avail our
selves of the forms and plans adopted by the
Golden Gate Park Commission, so far as they
may seem to meet our requirements aud con
duit ions.
Colonel Bridges' report was also made
public to-aay. The Colonel is the con
sulting engineer of the Board of Trade
and he has made a thorough stuayof con
ditions and localities. He says that Oak
land admits of a system of boulevards
and parks that can be located more ad-
Tantageously than in any other city in
America.
Colonel Bridges says that the most de
sirable and the easiest obtained localities
would be as follows:
1. The Occidental Park, near Sixteenth-street
station, West Oakland, with 100 acres east of
the Southern PaciÃc Raiiroad tracks (and fifty
acres on the west of the Southern Pacific Rail
road iracks now belonging to the city).
2. Central Parkâ The most central and avail
able location (after the Occidental Park, on
the west bay shore) for a public park is un
doubtedly at the head of Lake Memtt, known
as the Sathi-r, Merritt and Crocker tracts, ex
tending irom Lake Merritt boulevard along
Excelsior avenue to the junction of Fourteenth
avenue and Moraga Valley road at Milbury
street; thence along said county road until
Lake avenue extended would reach said
county road; thence by Lake avenue to head
of Lake Merritt. This would include Indian
Gulch, Trestle Glen, all of the Sather and Mer
ritt hill and valley lands and a small portion
of the Crocker lands, making a gem of a nat
ural park oi about 400 acres that would attract
ail citizens a;id visitors.
Ea-t Oakland bou.evards and drivesâ From
a junction with Lake Merritt, Fourth
avenue and Seventh street to Fourteenth
avenue, with a bridge over Commerce avenue
to Fifteenth avenue to and along Sixteenth
street, passing Independence Square to a
crossing Fruitvsle avenue to High street and
Prescott street to Central avenue. Also along
Park street from Sixteenth street to the .Ala
meda city steel bridge, and on High street
from Prescott street to the Alameda
city line. .East Oakland would nave
an admirable system of drives to what is much
needed to that wel.-settled part oi the city,
viz. : a public perk.
The Fremont Parkâ Located on the north of
Eixtt-enth street and Prescott street, on the
east of Redwood county r .ad south oi Vernon
avenue, continued to Central avenve and west
of Central avenue containing about 500 acres,
or the tract bounded by Prescott street, Red
wood county road, Vernon avenue and High
street, containing about 300 acres of high
rolling ground well covered w ith forest, shade
trees, etc., well adapted for a pub;ic park.
The Pacih'c Park, the grand park of the fu
ture, not only lor this city and vicinity, but
for the Pacific Coast, of not less than 1000
ncres, can and should be secured alone the
hills and dales ot Temescal Creek (inc'uding
Little Chabot Like) where nature has done so
much. There is no natural park that can ex
cel it, and now is the time to secure these
grounds and water rights even if the im
provements are not made until other parks
are completed.
With boundaries commencing at Broadway
and College avenue, College avenue to Clare
mont avenue to the Ballard tract, Russell
street from College avenue, crossing Clare
mont avenue, continuing to the Gwin estate
tract to the northwest corner of the Gwin and
Kohler tracts ; thence along the west side of
the A. Kohler tract to tract "A," to J. Dingee
tract, including the "D" Dingee tract, along
the west side of the cemeteries to and along
Clifton street to the junction of Broadway and
College avenue.
The system of drives and boulevards in con
nection with present and proposed parks is
now authorized by State laws of 1889, and only
need to be dedicated and set apart lor present
and future uses. I know oi no city where
streets can be so easily and economically cou
â  verted into excellent drives and boulevards,
and with a few links of new roads or streets all
of your parks will be connected with them.
I respectfully recommend that your commit
tee submit a list of streets to the City Councils
and Board of Supervisors that may be set apart
for drives and boulevards without delay, and
that an act may be prepared aud passed by the

OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 21.â The funeral of Miss Kate Stanton will take place to
morrow morning from the little Catholic church at Hay wards. The deceased young
lady will long be remembered by hundreds of those whom she helped in a substantial
manner during the past few years. Miss Stanton was three years ago a belle of San
Francisco society, and her family holds large possessions in Alameda County. Miss
Kate Stanton is known as the young lady who would stop her carriage and take in
anybody, no matter how humble, whom she would meet toiling along the county
road. A few months ago she was stricken down by consumption and gradually sank.
People of all creeds are preparing to attend her funeral, and all the town of Haywards
will be present to show their love and respect for her. She was only 23 years of age
and lived with her mother, Mrs. M. Stanton, in Castro Valley.

FOUR NOW TWO.
Nuptials of the De Mont Sisters to
George Bambxuer and John Allen
of Merced.
OAKLAND, Cai*. Oct. 2Lâ A pretty
double wedding took dace in the parloss
of tbe First Presbyterian Church at 7
o'clock this evening, the Key. R. F. Coyle
officiating. The principals were the
daughters of Mr. ami Mrs. George R. de
Mont, well-to-do residents of Merced

WHO WAS THE INVENTOR?
Trouble Over Who First Saw
Faces Through a Tele
phone.
A Swedish Scientist and an Eastern
Physician Compete With the
Local Man.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) i
9uÃ Broadway, Ocu 21. j
The contest for the honor of having in
vented the process by which it is claimed
pictures can be transmitted through a
machine just as sound is now transmitted
through a telephone has taken an inter
national turn. Dr. F. M. Close, the San
Francisco scientist; a Swedish inventor
described as "a prominent physicist in his
own country," and the unknown Alameda
j wealthy amateur electrician ail claim to
be the designers of the process.
A few weeks ago Mr. Harbourne, the
c ty librarian, made public the fact that
the unknown Alamedan had completed
his work and was going to experiment
with his visual telephone on one of the bay
wires of the Sunset Company.
This information reached Dr. Close and
he wrote to Mr. Harbourne, referring him
to the New York Herald, in which his in
vention, the telectroscope, is fully ex
plaine-l.
"If your friend has something practi'
j cal," wrote Dr. Close, l I should very much
I liKe to meet him. Perhaps in the combi
nation of our iueas tne desired result of a
practical machine and the consequent
realization of its commercial value would
be more speedily attained." Dr. Close
says his invention is caveatei and will be
patented.
"1 have read the account of Dr. Close's
invention," said Mr. Harbourne, "but it
is nothing like that of my friend. I am
not at liberty to introduce the two gentle
men at this time. We are now laying a
cable to East Oakland under the estuary,
and will make nothing more public until
we have completed our experiments. The
machine has done all that is claimed for
it over a coil of wire three miles long, but
! it has often been lound that the same re
sults are not attained when the same wire
is stretched out and run under water, and
we are anxious to guarantee perfect re
suits before we seek notoriety."

OAKLAND. Cal., Oct. 21.â The case of

o'clock. Coroner Baldwin will attend and
have personal supervision of the ease.
The facts were given out to-day by the
family and nothing new will be learned at
the inquiry.
"Mr. and Mrs. Wahmuth Sr. left borne
early in the afternoon for San Francisco,"
said a member of the family to-day,
leaving the daughter-in-law at home and a
son, Louis, in school. The latter came
home at 3 o'clock and found the house
closed and locked. Thinking by this that
his sister-in-law was visiting he went off
to play. At 7 o'clock the parents and hus
band returned toeether and found Louis
trying to get in. They entered and found
the wife's hat on the table. Thinking that
his wi;e had retired he went to their room,
but found it empty. On looking farther
he found gas escaping from one of the
rooms and broke in the locked.door, where
he found bis wife."
In regard to finding her Mr. Wahmuth
said: "I opened the door to the room,
and there lay my dear wife upon the floor,
with the pas turned on. She was still
breathing, aud I picked her up and placed
her upon a lounge. Dr. Stedman was
called, and after working over her an hour
we called Dr. Keys, but she breathed her
last before be arrived.
"Often when I spoke to her of late I
have noticed that she did not seem to un
derstand what I said. She seemed dazed
and frequently complained of pains in
her bead. I cannot ascribe any cause for
the act."
The deceased was formerly Miss Bertha
Ruff, daughter of Stephen" Ruff of 3255
Briggs avenue, and bad lived here nearly
seven years. She and a sister were con
sidered among the most bcautilul girls of
this city. Her parents stated to-day that

since her marriage in June last.
Tne funeral will take place Friday
morning at 11 o'clock. Interment will be

AFRAID Of THE TENTS,
Co-Eds Fearful Lest the Can
vas Houses Should
Collapse.
An Ex-Convict Has Trouble With His
Wifeâ Brief Berkeley
Items.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 21.â Work on
the erection of the second and largest tent
of the three on the grounds of the State
University was completed to-day. The
large tent, which measures 40x80, will be
be used for an assembly hall, principally,
and is capable of accommodating 500 stu
dents. Though more than ordinary pre
caution has been taken to firmly erect
these canvas houses and to provide for
sufficient guy ropes and stays, yet there is
some fear that they will not withstand the
storms of the comine winter. Tho fact
that the tents are rectangular and hip
roofed rather than circular tends to
strengthen the belief that the wind and
rain will seriously affect their stability.
Some of the co-eds have expressed
themselves as being rather afraid of at
tending recitations within the impromptu
houses when a "southeaster" is blowing
lest they should collapse.
Tronble With His Wife*
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 21.â H. L. M.
EMridee, an ex-convict, was arrested by
Officer Esmond last night on a charge of
burglary, pre erred by his wife. She
states that Eldridge, with whom she has
not been living since about the first of
August, entered his house and stole a
nugget pin belonging to her. Elaridge
was taken to the County Jail last night,
where he will await trial.
The main evidence of the prosecution is
a pawn ticket from ar. Oakland loan office,
which was made out in Eldridge's name.
The accused has been out of the State
prison for only about eighteen months,
having served two- terms, aggregating fif
teen years. One conviction was for burg
lary in Alameda County and the other was
in San Francisco.
The couple have been married for only
about six months.
Student* at the Foils.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 21.â An appeal
has been made to the students at the State
University by the Citizens' Charier Asso
ciation and tne Citizens' Non-Partisan
Association to aid them in counting the
ballots in Ban Francisco on the nigtit of
election. The system of having university
students to act as watchers at the polls
and during the counting of ballots after

during the big anti-Tammany campaign of
two years ago. Jt is now proposed to have
the students act asasort of a policeduring

G.nerai G od Cheer Are the
Attractions.
The fair and festival in Mangels' Hall
on Folsom and Twenty-fourth streets, in
aid of Si. Peter's Courcb on Twenty-fourth
ana Alabama streets, is a pronounced suc
cess. The purpose is to gather a fund for
the interior decoration of the church.
When this is complete St. Peter's Church
will be one of the most beautiful places of
worship on the coast.
Father Casey's parishioners nave rallied
to the cause with an energy and enthu
siasm which shows that their hearts are in
the work. Already $8000 has been realized
at the fair, and as it will not close until the
last Saturday in the month it is believed
that this sum will be considerably in
creased.
Never since Mangels was erected has it
presented such animated scenes as it does
and has for the past few weeks. The
booths are of artistic design and the en
lire interior is gayly decorated in bright
colors pleasing to the eye. Everywhere

raised a terrible row, which wound up in
her making an assault upon him, from
which assault he beat a hasty retreat.
Asrain in May, 1896, Mrs. Inglis is ac
cused of attempting to beat the defendant,
and on August 29", at the Victoria Hotel,
she is said to have, in the presence of

Dan Stuart, tbe noted sporting man of
Texas, who had the management of the
great carnival at Dallas when tne Corbett
and Fitzsimmons tight was billed to come
off there, arrived here yesterday ana is at
the Palace. Stuart is a heavy-built man,
about 45 years old, with a broad, bronzed
face, black and thick hair and da rk eves.
He was disinclined to be interviewed,
intimating at first that he was here for
pleasure, and finally saying that he did
not wish to be quoted. His coming was
unexpected. It is believed he is here to
bring about changes of interest to the
sporting world. He has never been in,
San Francisco before, he says, but has
several times been at Sacramento. Stuart
not only had to do with tbe arrangements
for xhe Corbett-Fitzsimmons tight which
ended as a fiasco, but was a leading spirit
in the Fitzsimmons-Maher fight. He has
lost a lot of money lately, according to
accounts.

SENATOR WHITE
TALKS FOR BRYAN
Says the Boy Orator Is
Old Enough to Be
President.
Is Anxious About ths Election
of a Democratic Legis
lature.
ROBERT B. SMITH OF MONTANA.
Said to Resemble Mr- Bryan Some
what in Appsarance and His
Style of Speaking.
Hon. Robert B. Smith, the fusion can
didate of the Democrats and Populists for
Governor of Montana, spoke at Union
Hall on Howard street last nitrht.
Mr. Smith is a good speaker. In appear
ance be somewhat res-embles William
Jennings Bryan, except that his front hair
is somewhat scanty. But the resemblance
does not end here, for in style of oratory,
diction and manner of delivery Mr. Smith
has been further likened 10 Mr. Bryan.
In his introductory remarks William H.
Afford, chairman of the California Demo
cratic campaign committee, gained a
round of applause by saying that though
the Democrats of this State were proud of
Mr. Smith's help yet he insisted that no
outside assistance was really needed, since,
in his opinion. California is safe for JJryan
anyhow. He said Mr. Smith would be the
next Governor of Montana.
The first part of Mr. Smith's speech was
devoted to a history of the Presidential
nominating conventions of the present
year, and he congratulated the people on
the fact that there had been no juggling
of words in the platforms of the different
parties. The issue had been clearly made.
In his opinion those who believe the mag
nates of Wall street and of Threadneedle
street and the power? and potentates of
foreign countries oueht to control our
legislat'on, financial ami otherwise, oueht
to vote for Mr. McKinley; otherwise,
otherwise.
Speaking to his hearers as wageworkers
and producers he warned them against the
dangers that he believed lurked in the
goldbug policy of the Republican party.
Senator Stephen M. White of Los An
geles was greeted wit i cheers.
National matters, Mr. White said, would
receive his attention.
It would not avail much for the people
to elect Mr. Bryan .President, Mr. White
said, unless they backed him up by choos
ing Democrats to the United States Senate
and to the House of Representatives. He
paid a glowing tribute to judge James G.
Magnire.
Referring to Mr. Estee, Mr. Barnes, Mr.
Scott, and Mr. Butterworth, the speaker
declared that all these gentlemen had
clanged their views on the silver question
within s*ix months.
Mr. White said it had fallen to his lot to
preside over the deliberations of tne great
est convention of recent times. That con
vention had declared unequivocally in
favor of the free and unlimited coinage of
silver witliou: the consent of foreign pow
ers. He was willing to admit that the
Queen of England and Kaiser of Germany
had a right to conduct the affairs of their
own realms, but there their power ended.
Touching the question of the gold
standard, Mr. White said that such a
standard would double our National debt
and cut the income of the working-classes
one-half. The United States as a debtor
nation is interested in the extension of
the circulating medium, and our peocle
in their own behalf ought to oppose the
enforcement of the gold standard. Mr.
White said:
Some people ask what it matters to us of
California whether we have the double stiuici
ard hero, since ino>t of our contracts call
specifically for pajment in gold. Skin deep,
indeed, must be the knowledge of political
economy that asks sucha question. It is not
that we shall pay onr deuts in gold, as we
shall in nil probability continue to do, but
that the gold which we mast pay has been
going up and up.until like the faDled ladder of
the Orient it rises beyond our reach. True bi
metallism will guard against this danger, and
that is the course to which the Democratic
party is pledgeo.
I recall to you the scenes that were enacted
on the r.anks of tnc Monongahel?., when the
blood of union laboring men was shed b'j
causc they dared to protect their manhood.
They were shot down by such men as Mark
llanca and those who are associated with him.
Yei. these men declare that they arc devoted to
the gold standard, because it will keep the
â¢wages of the working people from being ie
duccd.
Will yon, who have seen the fury of the
soldiery aud the power of a great priva'-e de
tective agency, armed to the teeth, thrown in
the scale against your companions? Will you
nllow these men to deceive you with such sud
den simulation of interest in your welfare?
Will you permit them to seduce' you from the
support or that man who is to-day lighting the
real battle for the people?
Tariff legislation, Mr. White declared,
would not bring relief.
Bonie people had pretended to think that
the working-men would be coerced and
would be forced to vote against thoir prin
ciples. He aid not believe it. He em
phasized his advice for th m to make any
kind of a promise that was necessary to
hold their jobs and then go into the Aus
tralian ballot booth and vote in accord
ance with their own conscience. Some of
the Republican newspapers had criticized
him ior giving such advice, yet he was
willing to 3tand the consequences.
Bryan's youth was a subject in which
Mr. White showed much interest. He
thought at any rate he was doing a man's
work. :
THEY WAIT MORE SPACE
Improvement Clubs Tnink the
Papers Are Not Fair to
Them.
They Rg>ice Over the Defeat of the
Geary-Street Francbiss Ex
tension.
The Associated Improvement clubs met
last night in B'nai B'rith Hall. Forty-six
delegates were present from the various
clubs comprising the main organization.
Vice- President. George R. Fletcher pre
sided in the absence of President James D.
Phelan.
In the matter of street franchises a com
mittee reported that the decision on thnt
very day by Judae Daingerrield was favor
able to the position taken by the associa
tion and would probably prevent for sev
eral years at least the passage of the
Geary-street iranchise by a Board of
Supervisors.
The inconvenience long caused to traffic
on Montgomery street by reason of the
fact ihat the horsecars pass to the left of
each other instead of to tne right, was
called to the notice of the association by
J. J. McSwen. A committee, consisting
of J. J. MtEwen, Charles Ellis aud Leon
Samuels, was appointed to visit Mr. Vin
ing and request that the tracks be properly
arranged now that the pavement on
Montgomery street is being repaired.
Mr. Williamson was introduced to the
meeting and proceeded to deplore the
amount of good newspaper sj ace daily
given to political cartoons and to news
from outside towns. He would have a
change instituted Jn San Francisco's news
paper offices, whereby some of that space
might be curtailed and in ore given to en
couraginT the work of the improvement
clubs. He expressed his views in the fol
lowing resolution, which, after he had
finished reading, the meeting indulgently
adopted:
Whereas, This City is awakening from its
past lethargy and its citizens have been
nrouscd to its needs and necessities and are
banding together for local improvements and
to encourage home industries and enterprises
and to stimulate the consumption of home
products; and whereas the press of this City
has in times past been a misjhty factor in en
cotiragiu? such enterprises and has promoted
ami fostered home producisand local improve
ments, but of lale and at present is not pub-
Hshing the local news of this City to any ex
tent, giving Oaklnud and the surrounding
towns more prominence than the metropolis;
therefore be it
Betolved, That we deplore this leek of zeal on
the part of our papers and protest against this
metnod of retarding this City and booming

JOCKEY MARTIN HERE
Will Bide for Fat Dunne During; the
Coming Racing Seasonâ
of the Turf.
Jockey Willie Martin is in town. Willie
and the officials of the New York Jockey
Club clashed over riding matters, bat the
jockey arrived from St. Louis yesterday
with the string of Pat Dunne and expects
to ride for his employer throughout the
winter. In Dunne's stable are such good
ones as Flying Dutchman, Captive,
Damien, Salvable, Preston' and Stentor.
The Dutchman broke down during his
last run in lie far East, but it is thought he
may again stand training after a long
rest. .With the Dunne string came eleven
horses owned by Eugene Leigh. J. Gard
ner will do the riding for the latter
horseman.
Jack Atkins and Abe Stein is a book
making firm that will probably weigh-in
the opening day at Oakland. .
While driving through the part near
the beach on Monday, Galen Brown,
trainer for A. B. Spreckels, met with an
accident that resulted in his losing several
strips of skin from his face, numerous
sundry bruises and a smashed buggy. An
amateur bicycle rider, spinning along i the
road, lost control of his wheel, and taking
a header fell under the hoofs of the horse
driven by Brown." The animal lunged to
one side, brincing tip against a fence, and
then began kicking the vehicle he was
hitched in to pieces. . . â¢ â¢
He : was quite successful in his efforts,
and finally, freeing himself, started off on
his own account. Mr. Brown, bruised and
dusty, walked home saying all sorts of
pretty things about bicycles and bicycle
riders.
The programme for the first ten days'
facing at Ingleside will be issued to-day.
The initial event |the opening day at
Ingieside on '.Wednesday; October 28, will
be a $1000 handicap over's distance of one
mile, with entries closing on Saturday
night. Weights will be out on Tuesday,
October 27, when declarations will be in
order. '
Judge Joseph J. Burke, who will pre
side in the stand at the Oakland track, is
in the City. He reports that San Fran
cisco stands head and shoulders over most
of the Eastern cities as a racing center,
and says there will be no dearth of first
class horses and celebrated racing men
here from. New York and vicinity in a
short time.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 22, 1896.
THE SHIFTING OF
THE LOCAL ARMY
Arrival of Several Batteries
of the Third Ar
tillery.
The Last of the Fifth Starts
Eastward Next Sat
urday.
A MYSTERY CF ALCATEL Z
Rather Awkwari Arrangement in
Order to Give Col. Sbafter Com
mand at the Presidio.
Two batteries of the Third; Artillery, Bat
tery D, Captain Humphries, and L, Cap
tain Hess, a part of the command taking
the place of the Fifth Artillery, sent
East, arrived yesterday. They were under
command of Colonel Wiiliston. Captain
Hess' command was sent to Alcatraz and
Captain Humphries' to the Presidio.
The other troops, the main body and
completing the detachment, except the
light batteries, will arrive this morning
under command of Colonel Bainbridpe.
They are Batteries A, B, E, G, H and K.
Battery A will be stationed at Alcatraz
and B, G, H and X go to the Presidio and
E will go to Fort Mason. Battery lof
this same regiment will co to Fort Canby.
Captain Smith of Battery X and Bur
bank of Battery G and Davis of Battery B
do not accompany their commands, the
first being on leave in Europe and the sec
ond beinj: detaileo for duty with the Na
tional Guard of New York, and Davis of
Battery B serving now as aid-de-camp on
General Miles' staff.
Battery A is under command of Captain
James Chester; E, Captain Pratt, and H,
Captain O'Hara. These batteries were
expected to arrive yesterday, but they
were delayed.
On Saturday morning the last two bat
teries of the Fifth stationed here will
leave for their new quarters in the Ea*t,
D, Captain Thorp, going to Fort Hamil
ton in New York Harbor, and F, Captain
Riley, to Kansas. Their places will be
taken by Battery E of the Third, Captain
Lancaster, and F, Captain Potts, the one
from Washington and the other from San
Antonio. This will complete the transfer.
The location of the artillery on Alcatraz
Island causes some comment in military
circles, as it will necessitate bringing the
men over to the mainland where the guns
are every day for drill.
Colonel Shafter, the senior officer here
in command of the First Infantry, having
been transferred from Angel Island to the
Presidio, it is presumed that the artillery
has been disposed of in this manner
in order to allow him to command this
post.
It has been intimated, by way of ex
planat on, that guns were to be placed on
Alcatraz, but experts say that the scheme
of the defense of the harbor does not con
template any such action lor, at least, ten
years to come.
FAVOR THE CHARTER
School Teachers jCall a Meeting for
To-Morrow to Dlscnsg Means
for Its Passage.
Those of the teachers in the Public
School Department who are in favor of
the adoption of the proposed new charter
have concluded that the time for con
certed action in the matter has come and
that they must express their feelings.
A circular has been issued signed by
Albert L.yser, Nettie A. "Wood, AUolph
Herbst. Frank Morton, A. L. Mann, R. D.
Faulkner and Jean Parker, calling a meet
ing for 4 o'clock to-morrow afternoon at
the Girls' High School Auditorium. The
circular reads as follows : .
The undersigned, who issue this call, be
lieve our tenure in imminent danger, pot
irom the new charter, but from the present
disorganized condition of our City govern
ment.
They believe tde new charter specially as
sures and guarantees the tenure by which we
hold our positions, making the same depend
ent solely ou competency and good behavior.
To aid in the adoption of the new charter,
hnrmouious action is needed.
That action, initiated irom such a united
body of teachers as agrees witn us in the Im
mediate necessity for the charter, will be an
efficient means witti the people of San Fran
cuco to secure its adoption.

Yesterday was a busy dny for Hymen.
The little god of marriage had to preside
it three weddings â one afternoon cere
nony and two evening ones.
The nuptials of Dr. William F. Dohr
nann and Miss Chrissie Siebe was a most
ilaborate affair. About 200 guests were
issembled to witnes3 the marriage of this
DR. AND MRS. W. J. P. LAWTON (nee Nightingale), "Who
Were Married Last Evening.
"oung couple, whose wedding means the
â¢_nion of the two most prominent German
aroilies in this City.
Miss Siebe is the daughter of Assessor
fohn D. Siebe. She is talented and beau
iful and a preat social favorite. Dr.
Johrmann is the son of President Dohr
nann of the Merchants' Association and
s extremely popular anions a host of pro
essional and fashionable friends.
The Siebe residence on Sacramento
(treet, where the ceremony was per
ormed, is eminently adapted for enter
aininp purposes. The rooms are a!i
arge and handsome and conveniently
â pen into one another. They lend them
elves readily to the decorator's art, and'
â esterday evening were more than usually
ittractive with their wealth of autumn
)lossom decorations.
In the main drawing-room, where the
cremony was performed, white chrythan-
Lemumsand great branches of stripped
taniboo were used for adornment.
At 9 o'clock the young coupie met at
he improvised altar, where the Rev. Mr.
'"uendeling pronounced them man and

The bride looked extremely lovely in

WILD~
With Eczema
I was a sufferer for eight years from Eczema, but "^
now am entirely cured. " The palms of my hands '
were covered . and , badly inflamed ; j little white .
blisters appeared, then would peel off, leaving %
a red, smooth surface, which would burn like i-
' fire and itch. On the inaide of the tipper part of ;
. my limbs,' great red blotches would appear, and I
dm soon as I became warm, the burning and itch- 1
ing would begin. >. Night after night I would lie %
awake and scratch, and almost go wild. I got a â¢
box of Cuticdra, and a bottle of Cuticura Rk- B
bolvunt, and after a few applications I noticed I
the redness and inflammation disappear; before 1
had uÂ»ed one box then uai not a sign of Ecxftna ',
left. I can truthfully aeÂ»ert that $2.00 worth of I

sage was cut low and finished off with a
tiny flounce ol lace.
A. H. Williams officiated as best man.
After the ceremony the newly married
couple led tbe way to the dining-hall,
where an elaborate supper was served by
Ludwig.
Toasts were in order, and A. H. Wil
liams proposed the health of the young
couple in a song especially composed for
tbe occasion by Charles Bundschu.
Each guest carried away a handsome
souvenir of the wedding in the shape of a
white and gold leafl t which contained sev
eral appropriate verses written in honor
of the young couple. There were verses
of sentiment both in English and German
and verses with a touch of comedy. Many
of the verses were set to the melody of
popular operatic selections and were sung
by the assembled company with right
good cheer.
Dr. and Mrs. Dohrmann are going South
for a bridal tour and on their return they
will reside with John D. Siebe until
January, when their new home will be
completed.
Only relatives and a limited number of
intimate friends were present at the
nuptials of Miss Minnie Niphingale,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Nightin
gale and sister of Dr. Nightingale, and Dr.
W. J. P. Lawton, a popular young dentist
of This City.
||The ceremony was performed at 8:30
o'clock, Rev. Dr. Siebbins officiating. In
the way of ideal simplicity there were no
bridal attendants, no maid of honor, no
bridesmaids and no best man.
The briae wore an elegant gown of white
brocaded satin. The skirt was made walk
ing length and finished off with a full
ruche of the satin. The corsage was
veiled with chiffon and finished off with a
bertha of point applique.
Dr. and Mrs. Lawton have gone to re
side at their new home, 310 Haight street,
and will receive the second and fourth
Wednesdays.
The weddine; of MissHattie Maud Cross
and Louis Muller was celebrated yester
day afternoon at half-past 3, at the resi
dence of the bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
J. R. Cross, 801 Haight street. Pastor
Fuendeling officiating.
The bride was attended by Miss Lillian
Hudson, who officiated as maid of honor,
and Miss Rose Trainor, who acted as
bridesmaid. R. W. Roberts was the best
man.
The bride wore a pretty gown of white
mousseiine duchesse over white silk. The
veil was fastened to the coiffure by a spray
of lilies of the valley and a diamond star,
the pift of the groom.
Miss Hudson wore a stylish dres3 of
cream China silk and Miss Trainor'sgown
was of cream flowered taffeta.
Mr. and Mrs. Muller will spend their
honeymoon in Southern California, and
pn their return will occupy their ne k home
on Devisadcro street, near* Waller.
TO ENJOIN THE AUDITOR.
The Civic Federation Will Tegt the
County Government Law.
The Civic Federation has been busy of
late between preparing for the campaign
and the protection of the nominees of the
Non-Partisan party at the polls and during
the count.
In addition to this an injunction will be
asked for to prevent Auditor Broderick
from auditing the demands of the deputies
of the County Clerk, Sheriff and the other
county officers embodied in the recent de
cision of ttie Supreme Court.
This conclusion was reached at a meet
in^ of the federation last night, at which
injunction proceedings will be com
menced during the present week, with
either Joseph Britton or Stewart Menzies
as the plaintiff and William Broderick as
the party to be enjoined.
This action the federation claims must
be sustained in view of the recent de
cision rendered by which a portion of the
City and County officers are municipal
and others county.
Th< county officers under this decision,
the federation claims, must pay their
deputies out of their own pockets.

ment

welfare and best interests of the owners of
property, to encourage needed enterprise and
home industries, to promote such needed pub
lic improvements thnt will enhance values and
encourage immigration to our City.
Jvirstâ For the mutual protection of the vari
ous real estate firms.
Second â To have such laws and regulations
passed at the coming term of the State Legis
lature, whereby the owners of property and
tenants may be better protected with refer
ence to the unlawful detainer laws now in
vogue in this State and for such other and
wholesome laws as may be necessary and
proper to advance the municipal govern
ment of this City and County.
Thirdâ The association is non-partisan and
will select the more capably candidates aspir
ing for office at the coming election, who will

ernment to this City.
The real estate firms of this City, realizing
that the majority of the citizens of this City

the various aspirants for office and reporttjjeir
qualifications to the public In general and the
taxpayers, and to thittend an organization has

organized a powerful combination.
This ticket will be published in the press of
this City of the various indorses, and will be
mailed to every client, landowner and tenant

insure the election of most any candidate re
ceiving its indorsement, as they are in touch
and sympathy witu most all the real estate
owners and people renting property in the
City and County of San Francisco.

DARE WAS INDIGNANT
Republican Candidate for Senator De
nounces the Chronicle in
Open Court.
John T. Dare scorched the Chronicle
yesterday morning in open court. Mr.
Dare is the regular Republican candidate
for State Senator from the Mission. He
is also a lawyer and is Prosecuting Attor
ney in Police Court 3.
The courtroom was filled when he arose
and requested of Judge Joacbimsen a per
sonal privilege. He then read this short
article from the morning's Chronicle:
Thomas Connelly, the boy who fired three
shots from a pistol at his father at Twenty
fourih and Sanchez streets last Thursday
afternoon, was held to answer yesterday by
I'olice Jud?e Joachimsen upon a charge of as
sault with a deadly weapon.
Prosecuting Attorney John T. Dare con
ducted the case for the people in a half-hearted
manner. It was apparent that he did not
ardently desire a conviction in the case. When
the judgment of the court was pronounced
Dare remarked that it was outrageous. Dare
is a candidate for State Senator, and Con
nelly's father lives in his district.
Remarking that the derogatory para
graph was "a lie from start to finish,"
and "unfair, malicious and dishonest,"
Mr. Dare declared that the report had
been deliberately falsified for political
purposes. He then called upon the sev
eral officers ol tne court to corroborate his
declarations regarding bis prosecution of
the case. Thereupon Judpe Joacbimsen,
Clerk Jacob Shane, Court Reporter Gaw
thorne, Officer McMurry and several others
who had been present on the day previous
intimated that they snared Mr. Dare's
indignation and openly denounced the
paragraph as cowardly and untrue.

AN ARMY OFFICER
UNDER SUSPICION
Quartermaster's Engineer
Humphreys Is Charged
With Dishonesty.
An Inquiry New Being Con
ducted at the Post Head
quarters.
HAS MADE SOME ENEMIES.
And His Friends Say That That Is
All There Is to the
Charges.
For the past several days, in the quiet of
a shady room at military headquarters, In
the Phelan building, there has been an
inquiry going on â not a court-martial,
but an inquirv â as to the competency of
Lieutenant Humphreys, engineer in the
chief quartermaster's office. That is the
way it is given out, but it is well under
stood that the inquiry is directed at a
more serious matter â a charge of dis
honesty.
Colonel Kimball is the chief quarter
master of the department. As his en
gineer Lieutenant Humphreys has had
active charge of a great deal of work that
has been carried on lately in the depart
ment, much of it at tbe Presidio. While
he does not have the actual making of
contracts he has much to say in the mat
ter. For a lone time past there have been
rumors that all was not as it should be in
his relationship with contractors. Tiie
contractors themselves have been chiefly
responsible for the rumors.
Some months ago open charges were
made by some of the contractors against
him a:id at that time some inquiry was
made. Since then these have been re
peated, this time by W. J. Holmes, a con
tractor, and the matter broueht formally
before Colonel Burton inspector-general
for this coast. That officer is now con
ducting a thorough inquiry into the mat
ter at headquarters.
Yesterday Lieutenants Hoan and Gatley,
quartermasters at different posts with
whom Lieutenant Humphreys comes
much in contact, were to tell what they
knew in the matter.
It is said in defeDse of Lieutenant
Humphreys that his position is one in
which it is very easy to make enemies;
that he has made them â quitea number of
themâ and that they in their tnrn have
constant opportunity to do him harm.
His friends say that this is ali there is to
the charge of dishonesty and that Hum
phreys will have little difficulty in making
this clear.
West End Republicans.
The West End Republican Club will

near Stanyan, to-night at 8 o'clock. Ar

This evening there will be a big labor
silver mass-meeting at iJnion Hall, under
the auspices of the silver campaign com
mittee. George Lafayette, past president
of the International Bricklayers' Union,
will preside. Tho speaker of the evening
will be M. F. Taylor, the gifted orator
from Colorado, who will discuss the labor
question and reply to the arguments made

dependent in politics. Mr. Bannerman,
the president, is a Republican.
The offices are evenly distributed among
Democrats and Republicans.
Judge Sullivan mnde a stirring speech
in favor of Mr. Dimond, whom he de
scribed as an anomaly in San Francisco
politics, an honest Supervisor, a man who
entered the Board of Supervisors poor
and leaves it poor. Upon the conclusion
of the Judge's speech three cheers were
given for Mr. Dimond and the Judge.
Frank T. Shea, architect of the City
Hall, the vice-president of the club, also
made a speech complimentary to Mr.
Dimond. As Mr. Shea concluded his
speech Mr. Dimond entered the hall and
received an ovation.
Mr. Eisenschimel. Mr. Bannerman,
George Â£. Gallagher, Judge Ferral, Coionel
O'Byrne and Charles McGiynn of the

forth that the Independent Dimond Club

for public offices; that Joseph I. Dimond
is such a man, as he has already proved
himself to be above corrupting influences
while filling tne office ol" Supervisor; that
he has proved himseU' a fearless pro
