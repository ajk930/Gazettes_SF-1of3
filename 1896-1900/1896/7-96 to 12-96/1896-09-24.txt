Peculiarly Happy Address to
the Young Men by the
Major.
HE ALSO TALES TO AN OLDEK
DELEGATION.
Reiterates His Assertion That It Is
Better to Open the Mills Than
the Mints.
CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 23.â delega
tions which came to call on Major Mc-
Kinley to-day were from the natural gas
districts of Ohio and Indiana. The first
visitors were from Wood County and
Bowling Green, Ohio. " They arrived about
2:30. The delegation was composed of a
first-voters' club of Bowling Green, parts
of the various Republican clubs of the
county and the Woman's McKinley and
HoDart Club. The members of the latter
organization wore white Tarn o'Shanter
caps. The whole delegation numbered
600. A. S. Parker was spokesman. In
response to his remarks Mr. McKinley
said:
i am glad to meet at my home this represen
tative delegation from Wood County. I am
especially glad to make suitable recognition
of the women who have honored me with
their presence to-day. [Cheers.] The pres
ence of this body of young men who are to
vote for the first time next November, is to me
an Inspiring sight, and that you are soon to
enjoy the priceless privilege of citizenship
must be to all of you an Inspiring thought. 1
wouder whether you fully appreciate the
privilege and honor which you are so soon to
have. I fear sometimes that few of us estimate
suffrage at its true worth. It clothes us with
sovereignty. It is a guaranty to our liberties
and institutions and is our surest safety. It is,
indeed, a priceless inheritance and should be
valued as such by every young man. It should
nrrer, so never, be Uiroita b^aiuat the coun
try and should never represent public dis
honor. [Applause.]
I recall, young men, my first vote. With
what a thrill of pride I exercised for the first
time the full prerogative of citizenship. In
the crisis of â in the very field of conflict â
my first vote was cast for Abraham Lincoln.
[Cheering.] It is to me a priceless memory.
You, gentlemen, did not have that privilege,
but it having been denied you then it will be
some satisfaction to you to vote for the party
oi Lincoln, which rallied -the . young men of
the country around the banner of liberty,
union and National honor between 1560 and
1865 [applause], and now summons you under
the same glorious banner. [Renewed ap
plause.]
It is seldom given to the first voters of this
country to start in in so important a National
contest, where so much is involved and where
so many interests are at stake. It is a year,
too, when old party divisions count for littleâ
when men of all parties are united in the'
common object to save the country from dis
honor and the currency from degradation.
[Cheers.]
My fellow-citizens, I ventured a few weeks
ego to suggest in a public speech that
it would be better to open the mills than
to open the mints. [Great cheers and cries of
"That's right."] I see thut some of our polit
ical adversaries criticize the statement, saying
that it is "putting the cart before the horse."
They seem to think that the way to open up
the woolen-mills, lor example, is to start a
yardstick factory. [Great laughter aud ap
plause. j They forget that you must make
cloth before you can measure it [renewed
laughter], and that the weaver must be em
ployed before the yardstick is required. [Ap
plause.] But they say the yardstick is too
long. I answer, if you make a yardstick nine
teen inches, instead of thirty-six inches, its
' present length, you will not increase the out
put of cloth or its value or give an additional
day's labor to the American weaver. Nor will
a 52-cent dollar increase industrial enter
prises, add to the actual earnings of anybody
or enhance the real value of anything. [Great
applause.]
It will wrong labor and wreck values, and
has done so wherever It has been used. More
cloth might require more yardsticks [laugh
ter], but more yardsticks or shorter ones will
not create a demai.d for more cloth. [Re
newed laughter and cries of "Good, good L"]
Nor will short dollars from wide-open mints
free to all the world increase our factories.
[Applause.] More factories at work will find
work for the good dollars now in their hiding
places and find employment for the good men
now idle at their homes. [Tremendous cheer
ing.]
Industry must come first. Labor precedes
all else. It is the foundation of wealth; it is
the creator of all wealth. [Applause.] Its
active employment puts money in circulation
and sends it coursing through every artery of
trade. [Great applause.] The mints don't
distribute it in thai way. Start the factories
in lull blast and the money will flow from bank
and vault. The lender will seek the borrower,
not, as now, the borrower the lender. - [Great
cheering.]
Start the factories and put American ma
chinery in operation and there will not be an
idle man in the country who is willing and
able to work. There will not be an American
home where hunger and want will not disap
pear at once, and there will not be a farmer
who will not be cheered and benefited by his
improved home markets and by the better and
steadier prices for his proJucts. [Applause.]
Plenty and prosperity will return to us again,
and do not forget, men and women of Wood
County, that you cannot coin prosperity [great
cheering] and you cannot revive industries
through the mints. They come through labor
and confidence, skill and enterprise and hon
esty, and they will come no other way. [Great
cheering.]
The second and last delegation to-day
came from Muncie. Ind. Four bands of
music accompanied the Indiana visitors,
and a more enthusiastic delegation has
not been seen for weeks in Canton. The
spokesman for the Indiana delegation was
N. E. N edham, who made an'earnest;ad
dress. In response Major McKinley said:
It is needless for me to say that I am greatly
nouored to receive this call from my .. fellow
clticens of Muncie. I must congratulate this
The San Francisco Call
Oh! What a Difference in One Short Year!
assemblage of Indianans upon the selection of
their spokesman, who has delivered before me
so able and eloquent and telling a speech.
[Applause.] He has said that "'it is understood
lam an American." That is altogether true.
[Applause.] 1 believe in America for Ameri
cans â native born and naturalized. [Cries of
â¢'Good."] I believe in the American payroll
[laughter and applause[, and I do not believe
in diminishing that payroll by giving work to
anybody else under another flag while we
have got an idle man under our flag. [Tre
mendous applause.]
Four years ago the laborer was agitating the
qnestion of shorter hours we then had so much
to do. I have heard no discussion ol that kind
for four years; [laughter and applause] but I
believe I have never beard of the laboring
man discussing the desirability of having
short do'lars. [Applause.] The complaint â
the chief complaint of our opponents is, first,
that we have not enough money, and, second,
that our money is too good. [Laughter and
applause.]
To the first complaint I answer that the per
capita of circulating medium in this country
has been greater since the so-called crime of
1873 than it ever was before [applause], and
that jt has been greater in the last five years
tliaa it ever -./as in all onr iikttory. We have
not only got the best money in the world, but
we have got more of it per capita than most of
the nations of the world. ] Applause.] We i
have got more money per capita than the
United Kingdom, than Italy, than Switzer
land, Greece, Spain, Roumania, Servia, Aus
tria, Hungary, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Russia, Mexico and the Central and South
American States, and more than Japan or
Chiua per capita. [Great applause.] So that
some reason rather than the lack of volume
of money must be found to account ior the
present condition of the country.
To the second complaint, that our money is
too good, it would seem to be enough to say
to say that the money of any country cannot
be too good, and that no nation ever suffers
from having its medium of exchange of the
highest and best quality, [Great applause.]
It has been poor money, not good money,
that has been the cause of so much loss and
ruin Id the past, both to the individuals and
to nations. [Applause.} The olaer men of
this audience will remember that before the
war we did business with an uncertain and
fluctuating currency known as State bank
money. Many ol these banks and their notes
were absolutely sound, but for the most part
they were subject to a discount* The total
number of banks in 1860, exclusive of State
branch banks, was 1570. Of this number "the
counterfeit detector," then in use, reported
832 as "broken, closed, failed, fraudulent anc
worthless." The notes of these banks were in
circulation among the people, and had been
received by them for their good labor and
their eood products. They were absolutely
worthless*, and of no more value than the paper
on which they were printed.
Upon whom did this loss fall, my fellow-citi
zens? There is scarcely an old gentleman in
this audience who will not recall that it fell
upon the laboring man and the farmers of tl.e
United States. [Cries of "That's right!" and
applause.] I allude to this only to show that
those who suffer most from poor money are the
least able to bear the loss. It is the story of
mankind, that the least valuable the money
which will pass current is the money that at
last finds its resting-place among the poorer
people, and when the crash comes the 10.-s
must be borne by them. You will remember
that from 1862 to 1879 we did business with
paper money exclusively â we had neither gold
nor silver; and you will remember that gold
was constantly at a premium, ranging from 40
to 100 per cent. Then when a man wanted to
borrow money he bad to pay a higher rate of
interest than he has had to pay since 1870 on
a gold basis. [Applause. ]
When we were doing business with a depre
ciated paper money Interest was very much
higher to the borrower and to the debtor than
it is now. 1 can recall when here in Ohio the
ruling rate of interest for that paper money
was 10 per cent annually, and often 1 per cent
a month or 12 per cent a year. The rnling
rate here in Ohio for what some people are
p'eased to call a 200-cent dollar is 6 or 7 per
cent to-day. It may run as high as 8, and pos
sibly that has been the ruling rate during the
last two or three years, but that is because dis
trust has fallen upon the country aud men
who have money will not part with it and
take chances without a higher rate of in
terest. Money to-day is idle because it cannot
De profitably and safely ii. vested by those
who have it. It is neither a lack of volume of
our money nor the quality of the money that
is our trouble, but a lack of confidence in the
steadiness and stability of business.
The threat oi free silver is driving our money
into hiding to-day. The way to bring it out is
to restore confidence, and how will you restore
confidence? There is only one way. [A voice:
"Vote for McKinley." Applause and laugh
ter.J The way to restore confidence is to defeat
tnrough the ballot the party that destroyed
confidence. [Cries of "Good."] We cannot re
store the business nt the country m long as we
do so much of our business abroad. [Cries of
"Good" and "That's right."] Let us bring Jt
back borne again for our own people and our
own labor, f Continuous cheering, j

RUSSIA ACTIVE IS THE ORIENT.
Placing Northeastern China in a Condi
tion for Defense Against
Other Powers.
LONDON, Ekg., Sept. 23.â A. special
dispatch to the Globe from its correspond
ent in Shanghai states that the Russians
are displaying great activity in the north
eastern part of China, and are placing the
country in a condition for defense.
Russian engineers have been busily at
work at Port Arthur for weeks. That im
portant place was left in bad condition
when the Japanese abandoned it at the
close ot the war with C hina.
The Russians are now placing every
thing in good order. The docks and war
ships will soon be iv better condition than
ever before, and vast enpplies of coal are
being collected there for the use of the
Russian warships. The piace was a very
important naval station when under
Chinese control. With the help of Russia
it can be made practically impregnable.
The Russian warships in the Pacific are
more numerous than the British, though
hardly as formidable. There is an ominous
activity about them, too. Everythine In
dicates that orders have been issued to
have matters in good shape should a
European war break out.
It has always been that the princi
pal object of Li Hung Chang's recent trip
around the world was 10 meet the Russian
authorities ana bring about an under
standing between that country and China.
From the activity prevailing now in and
around Port Arthur it is believed that a
satisfactory arrangement has been reached
and that there will be some sensational
developments within a short time.

LONDON, Eire., Sept, 23.â With the
dawn of to-day Queen Victoria's reign his
exceeded that of her grandfather, George
111, and she has, therefore ruled longer

ONE BIG FRIGHT OF THE DAT
Guns Fired and an Attempt Hade to
Destroy the Water Works and
Burn the City.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Sept, 23.â The
presence of the militia has had no appar
ent effect in quieting the nerves of the
people of this unfortunate city. The
feeling is so tense that the people clutch
eagerly at the most absurd rumors, and
the fear is general that dire disaster is
certain soon to come.
There were plenty of sensations to-day.
Interest centered in the hoped-for mar
tial law order which has not yet come
from Governor Mclntyre. General
Brooks received at an early hour to-aay
an order from the Governor which ap
pears to be of an advisory nature. Gen
eral Brooks was in aonversation with the
Governor over the telephone during the
day, and late to-night Brooks issued a
proclamation outlining his military policy
while in camp.
Judge Owers of the District Court also
talked with the Governor, bat was appar
ently not satisfied with his interview, and
he declined to talk.
All day the business men and mine
owners have been frantically demanding
martial law, that the strikers be disarmed,
their ammunition and dynamite confis
cated ana all possible means of resistance
taken from them.
A warrant was issued in the Justice
Court of P. M. Wall for the arrest of P. B.
Turnbull, vice-president of the Miners'
Union, &. J. Dewar, financial secretary of
the Miners' Union, Eugene Gannon, one
of the leading strike agitators and a
member of the Engineers' Union, and
Gomer Richards, a principal character in
the union strike committee. The men
are charged with being principals in the
riot which resulted in the killing of Fire
man Jerry O'Keefe at the Coronado mine
last Monday morning.
They were all placed under arrest be
fore 1 o'clock to-day. A large number
of arrests are likely to be made to-night,
and probably some effort to search for
arms will also be attempted.
One of the frights of the day was the
rather vague story of an attempt to de
stroy the city water works. The Miners'
Union has long boasted that in the event
of armed intervention it would destroy the
water system and burn the town.
The water works are located about two
miles from town, in California Gulch.
Troops were posted there yesterday, and
last night a detail of thirty men in charge
of an officer were stationed inside of the
works. Pickets were thrown out, and the
dark, rainy nieht passed as comfortably as
could be expected. Just before dawn
there was the flash of a shot and a faint
report on a distant hill, such as mig'it
have been a signal. A little later one of
the sentries made oat some dark forms
crawling up the hill. He hailed them and
was answered by a shot.
There was silence for a time, and then
several scattering shots were fired from
the gullies, but the attacking party, find
ing the guard wide awake, drew off with
out any injury so far as could De learned
on either side.
Colonel McCoy, in charge of Camp Mc
lntyre, took the matter less seriously, "I
am not inclined to think, from the report
my officers made to me, that there was
much in the affair," said he. "It is true
there were some shots tired in the dark
ness, but I don't believe, from what I
heard, that our boys returned them. None
of our men were hurt, and I am inclined
to think that it was mere horseplay on the
part of some one."
THE FATHER A FIEND.
Ghastly and A/most Successful Attempt of
Joseph Bash to Kill His Whole Fam
ily With a Crowbar.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Sept. 23 âA most
inhuman attempt upon the lives of a
whole family was made early this morn
ing by Joseph Bash.
The man rose early to prepare the morn
ing fires. For some unknown reason he
conceived the ghastly idea of killing his
whole family and securing a crowbar re
paired to the room where his wife and two
daughters were sleeping. With one. blow
he crushed the skull of his wife and then
turned to the cradle of his youngest child.
The 19-year-old daughter in another bed
awoke and sprang to arrest the fiend's
arm, but the blow fell across tne infant's
lace.
A desperate tight between father and
daughter took place. The girl's screams
brought assistance and the man fled. He
has not been arrested yet. The woman is
at the point of aeath, but the infant may
live.

GRAND JUNCTION, Colo., Sept. 23.â
The worst storm for ten years has been
raging since yesterday. East of here on
the Denver and Rio Grande road there are
eleven washouts within six miles.
The Rio Grande Western running west
from here is in a worse condition. A long
bridge at Salt Wash has gone out, as have
also several smaller ones. The Denver

here is badly damaged.
Trains on all roads are water- bound at
various points along the road. The main

ASBURY PARK, N. j., Sept. 23.â James
J. Corbett was arrested this afternoon at
his training quarters at Loch Arbor, for
negotiating a prize fight.
The warrant on which the fighter was
arrested was issued by Justice Borden on
information and papers brought here by a
detective. When arraigned before Justice
Borden he was met by friends and curious
spectators'. The champion was required
to give $1000 bail for his appearance in
New York on September 30. A. R. Par

signed the bail bond, and the prisoner
was discharged.

For Mayor â Charles 1.. Taylor.
For Auditorâ William A. Deane.
For Tax Collector â Cord Wetjen.
These were the nominations made at the
regular Republican Convention of the City
and County of San Francisco last night at
the Auditorium.
One of the most significant features of
the proceedings was the eutire absence of
anything that looked like a concession to
the disgruntled, dishonorable, dishonest
' and rule-or-ruin leaders of tie Mahoney-
Keily-Rainey stuffers and corruptionists.
To those who have the true and best in
terests of the Republican party of this
City and County at heart, and who have a
knowledge of what Is actually transpiring
among the leaders this was no surprise,
bnt many werejed to believe that an un
holy alliance, for such it would have been,
had been made with the men who pose as
Republicans for the only purpose of se
curing a dishonest revenue from the
patronage that might fall into their hands
for distribution.
It is true that overtures were mad.c to
the representatives of the regular organ
ization, bat they were so palpably dishon
est, dishonorable and indecent to every
man with any sense of shame or morality
that they were not even given considera
tion, but were indignantly rejected.
Tne story that these political tricksters,
devoid of purity as of power, had been re
ceived into the councils of the regular or
ganization was one invented by these
shameless would-be traffickers in the
spoils oi office, and then conveyed to Sam
Raiti' y, the leader of the faction of what
is now known as the reorganized Democ
racy, but better known as the Junta.
This ally of the Mahoney-Kellyites, in
accordance with the scheme of the latter,
poured forth the story to the editor of the
organ of the Junta, and, still following
out a prepared programme, that paper
gavetbe fake to tne puolic.
It has been questioned by many men
with a nice sense of honor whether there
really has been or is a combination between
these pseudo-Republicans and Sam Rai
ney, the boss of the Jamaâ whether men

could really sink as low as to wantonly
and for love of gain alone deliberately
plan to betray the party to which they
feigned allegiance.
For the information of such it can be
stated that a visit to the stable owned by
Sam Rainey on Bush street, just above
i Kearny. on almost any day will find the
I Democratic boss in consultation with Ma
i honey and Kelly, scheming how best the
latter may be able to aid the local Democ
racy by bringing disruption into the rankÂ«
j of the Republican party.
W: en the story published in the Ex
aminer yesterday morning alleging that
Nahoney and Kelly had been received
into fellowship with tne membership of
i the regular organization was called to the
t attention of J. D. Spreckels he was more
i amused than indignant. He said:
"Just let the people watch the proceed
i ings of the convention while it is in session
j at the Auditorium and they will find an
j answer to the fake story published that the
â¢ corruptionists had been allowed to break
| into the organization.
"They came to the leaders of oar organi
zation with a plan for joining forces with
us, but their conditions were so dishonest
and dishonorable that we could not, in
justice to ourselves and the party we rep-
resent, even give them decent considera
tion, and felt ourselves forced to reject ail
overtures.
'â No combination has been made and
none is likely to be made."
All the delegates to the convention were
in their seats, and on settling down to
business they presented the spectacle of a
respectable, intelligent body of men, ap
parently imbued wit^i sincere motives, for
they were in the fullest sense of the word
representative Republicans.
A clear understanding of their duties to
the people of San Francisco and to their
party made itself evident in the delibera
tions of this second session. All through
the greatest enthusiasm prevailed in
unison with harmony, and all these char
acteristics combined to make it an ideal
political meeting.
The nominees for Mayor, Auditor and
Tax Collector were greeted, each in turn,
with very flattering ovations, and this not
alone from the delegates but from the gal
leries and unreserved portions of the ball.
There could be no mistaking the seal of
public approval thus set upon the choice2
of the convention for these three offices.
It was all spontaneous and deeply in
earn
Every clause in the platform of the
regular Republican party of San Fran
cisco was accep ed with ringing plaudits,"
which told of its hearty commendation
by the convention. - ...-â¢*
When Chairman T. P. Riordan called
the convention to order the Auditorium
was densely crowded and the galleries
were full to the walls. With the rap of
the gavel silence fell upon the large gath
ering. .
James A. Stevens moved that the read
ing of the, minutes of the previous meet
ing be dispensed with. ' The motion was
promptly seconded and , carried unani
mously.
The report of the committee on organi
zation and order of business was read by
Assistant Secretary Andrew Branch.
The report was adopted by a unani
mous vote which was greeted with ap- '
plause. . ,
â¢â¢ Immediately after John M. ;â  Chretien
read the report of the committee on plat
â¢ form and resolutions. He said by way of
introduction that his committee had con
sidered ad interests in the regular Repub
lican party of Ban Francisco, with a view
that justice be done to all and that none
be slighted.
This announcement, brief as it was,
called out enthusiastic applause, where
upon Mr. Chretien added: "We have
done the best that we could, and sincerely
hope that our efforts in behalf of every in
terest of the local Republican party will
meet with your approval and the approval
of all Republicans of San Francisco.'.' *
The meeting was interrupted by a burst
of applause when the names of McKinley
and Hobart were mentioned, and at vari
ous other places the platform was cheered.
It is as follows:
The Republican party of the City and County
of San Francisco, this day assembled in muni
cipal, judicial and legislative convention,

We indorse the National Republican plauorm

Chairman of the committee on platform and
resolutions.
The platform was adopted amid hearty
applause after Martin Stephens of the
Thirty-ninth District hau moved for the
original question, which shut off debate.
The convention was only too well satisfied
with the patriotic declaration of princi
ples, and to a man almost, the delegates
saw notiiing to amend or to introduce.
Nominations, according to the order of
business, were then in order. They were
ruade amid frequent outbursts of enthu
siasm that cleariy indicated tbe entire
coruruendation of the nominations, and
the unity of sentiment which pervaded
the assemblage in favor of good ana true
men as representatives of the regular
Republican party in San Francisco.
lhe chair announced that nominations
f r Mayor were in order, and Robert Ash
of the Thirty-sixth Assembly District pre
sented the name of Colonel C. L. Taylor,
the Supervisor, for that office. Ash spoke
to the point, though compelled to desist
at repeated intervals by the plaudits of
his audience. He said :
Mr Chairman: I desire to make a nomina
tion for the renponsible and important posi
tion of Mayor. This convention is the Repub
lican convention of the City and county of
San Francisco. [Applause.] I wish to noml-
Tiate a man who is well known to you a
gentleman who will be a successful candidate.
The gentleman who I propose to place In
nomination (irst saw the light in the East
who comes irom one of our New England
States; who comes from that State which we
are all proud of ; that has always been a State
In the lead of the Republican party and its
principles, a State which has furnished us
huch statesmen as James G. Blame [appiause]
the grandest representative ot the Republi
cau party and its protective policy; and
Thomas B. Reed, another grand represen
thtive of Republican principles and a noble
defender of our National honor.
The erentleman whom I desire to nominate
is known to you all. Ii is Colonel Charles L.
Taylor.
At tbe mention of Supervisor Taylor's
name there was a spontaneous outburst of
WILLIAM A. DEANE; the Regular Republican Candidate for
Auditor.
applause which evolved into a storm of
cneers and shouts expresaite. of the en
thusiasm felt for the Supervisor who has
made such an enviable record within the
past two years. When the demonstration
had subsided sufficiently Mr. Ash con
tinued as follows: â¢
The gentleman whom I have named is known
as one of the most honest Supervisors the City
has ever had. He has represented the City
and County of San Francisco in a most honor
able and satisfactory manner to every citizen.
The Republicans are proud of his record, and
I pledee you, gentlemen, that if he is nomin
ated here to-night he will lead us to honor and
success.
Martin Stevens of the Thirty-ninth As
sembly District seconded the nomination
in an eloquent speech, which still further
stirred the convention. He said:
Mr. Chairman, gentlemen and fellow Repub
licans : Ii looks as If we are going to have a
little fight here, and that is what we like, be
cause it will be a fair fight and the best man
will win. lam here for the purpose of second
ing the nomination of Charles L. Taylor.
The immortal Lincoln said : "You can fool
some of the people all the time, you can fool
all of the people some of the time, but you
can't fool all the people all the time."
If Lincoln were here and he knew Charles L.
Taylor he would be standing on this platform
and pointing his index linger at him and say
ing that through all his long and honorable
hie he never fooled any of tho people any of
the time.
Here is a man who can unite the Republican
party of this City and County, and the Repub
lican who cannot vote for him deserves to be
incontinently kicked out af his party.
We have divisions in this County; we have a
great newspaper which ought tobe supporting
the regular Republican organization. If in all
the wide domain of this State, if from the top
most corner of the State to lie bottom, if in
any pface there is one man who owes the R?
publican party his unfaltering fealty and
strongest support, it is Michael Henry de
Young.
Against the sentiments of the State, against
every portion of it: against the sentiments of
the City and County, the then Republican
organization sent its delegates to Sacramento.
and they voted for him for United States Sen
ator first, last and all the time. If there is a
man who should vote this ticket, and par
ticularly if Charles L. Tavlor is nominated, it
is Mr. de Young. If he does not support him
he i& no longer a Republican, and the senti
ments ho expresses in his paper are not Re
publican sentiments. [Cheers and applause.]
This is a most Important office. If the charter
is adopted the Mayor will appoint nearly all
the officers in this City and county. It be
hooves us, then, io elece the Mayor if we wish
to save the City from the corrupt spoliation of
Democratic misrule, that has burdened it so
long.
Taylor can win, and we want to win, and I
believe that the other convention will be cer
tain to nominate him.
He reviewed the record of the Supervisor
while in office, and paid a nigh triDute to
CORD H. WETJEN, the Republican Candidate for Tax Collector.
his honor, honesty and ability and faith
fulness to duty. Continuing, he said:
It needs a man of thia kind for the office of
Mayor, and the taxpayers are ripe for a man
of this kind. They want a man who can hold
a thieving Board oi Supervisors in check, and
this is the man.
When the applause following Stevens'
address ceased a voice from the Thirty
second District wa9 heard above the cries
for "Taylor!" "Colonel Taylor!" All the
delegates listened to what was coming
from the Tliirty-second when the chair
had recognized Michael Hines of that dis
trict.
"I understand," yelled Hines, "that
Colonel Taylor has been already nomina
ted. He has been nominated by the A. P.
A." fCries of "No, no."]
"I want to nay, sir. that Mr. Taylor hails
from Maine, and Maine, sir, knows no
creed, exclaimed Stevens of the Forty- j
third, whereupon the house gave vent to a
Justy cheer. The name of Colonel Taylor
was placed before the convention by the
chairman, who shouted, "There is no
creed in this organization. This conven
tion is above creed âit Knows none."
There was a thundering "aye" in response
and Colonel Taylor was declared the regu
lar Republican nominee for Mayor of the
City and County of Ban Francisco.
As Colonel Taylor was not present the
chair appointed John M. Chretien, Robert
Ash and Martin Stevens as a committee
to escort him to the convention hall, so
that he could apoear before the delegates
and indorse the platform.
William H. Schooler of the Forty-first
District placed in nomination for Auditor
William A. Deane, in a highly eulogistic
speech. The name was greeted with loud
â¢nd long cheerinjr. The galleries went
lairlv wild, and when the din at last sub
sided some one called out, "Three cheers
THIS SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBJSK L' 4, lsye.
for Willie Deane," and three good cheers
were given.
Schooler said that Deane is a printer by
profession, and a bright, competent young
man, who enjoys remarkable popularity
all over town, where he has lived from
childhood. His character and his (itness
for the office were so well known, the
speaker said, it was not necessary to dwell
upon those qualities. Deane has been an
active Kepuulican for many years and has
many friends in the Democratic ranks as
we'l as in his own ptrty. He is a brother
in-law of M. H. de Young, editor and pro
prietor of the Chronicle.
The nomination was seconded by P. A.
Bergerot of tbe Thirty-eighth. District.
Deane was declared the choice of the
convention. "Is Billy Deane in the hall?"
asked Chairman Hiordan. He was pres
ent, and as soon ac he showed himself on
tbe platform delegates and spectators
cheered enthusiastically. He indorsed
the platform of the regular .Republican
party, and was declared the nominee by
acclamation. In his speech Mr. Deane
wag overcome oy the hearty reception ac
corded him, but clearly indorsed the plat
form.
Fred A. Elliott of the Thirty-sixth Dis
trict named for Tax Collector a man wno,
he said, was eminently qualified for the
position, a successful businessman, promi
nent in social and political circles and a
popular representative of the German
citizens â Cord Wetjen. The nomination
was seconded by Lincoln E. Bavage, who
said he had known Mr. Wetjen as a
"square" and honorable man and a worthy
member of the regular Republican party
of this City.
Mr. W'etjen said that if he was elected
Tax Collector the business of the office
would be conducted in an honest, intelli
gent and business-liKe manner. He
thanked the convention for the honor of
nomination, and was then declared the
nominee by acclamation.
At this juncture Colonel Taylor walked
from the wings uDon the stage. As soon as
lie showed himself fairly before the conven
tion a wild, enthusiastic cheer went up
from all parts of the house. Delegates
threw their hats into the air; others
jumped to their feet and swung theii arms
enthusiastically. It was some time before
this magnificent spontaneous reception
came to an end, and then Mr. Taylor, in a
dignifi-d and vigorous ruapner, in itself
convincing, made his speech of acceptance,
saying:
Fellow Republicans: I esteem this nomina
tion a great honor for more reasons than one.
In the first place, in looking at your faces, I
pee before me a body of intelligent, representa
tive menâ representative of the great priuci-
pies of the Repnbl lean party. But more than
all is the fact that I have been one of the hum
ble servants of this government for nearly
two years, and I look upon this nomination as
an indorsement of my actions in the past, and
I appreciate it on that account beyond any ex
pression that I can give.
I do not propose to take np your time with
any extended remarks. I ao not need to tell
you that I have long been in the Republican
ranks, and that forty years ago I was chairman
of tne Republican County Committee and
served as such for several years, and that I
presided over the first ratification meeting of
the nomination of Abraham Lincoln, and I
have served in the Republican party ranks
continuously ever since.
I have several timei: received the votes of the
people for different positions, and all of them
were unsoujrht, as was the case two years ago.
I was not advised and did not know until 10
o'clock next morning that I was nominated at
that time.
I never ran for office, but 1 feel that with
your support and the support I am offered
outside of the Republican ranks, for 1 have
been visited within the past three or four
months by hundreds of Democrats who have
proffered me their services, I shall certainly
carry the day. Ido not know how loyal the
Democrats are to their party this year. I find
that many are very shaky. They'are willing
to get in and give their strength to the party
of prosperity, and I expect to see on election
day an unusual turning over of that element
which has always heretofore been steadfast in
the ranks of the Democratic party.
I have beÂ«Â«n called upon within the last two
or three day* to say what I would do if I were
Mayor. I can't tell you what I would do if I
were Mayor. We will wait until the occasion
comes for action, and when it does I will en
deavor to be there and do my duty to the best
of my ability. If lam elected I shall make an
effort to serve the people of thia City and
County without regard to party and shall do
the best for thÂ» citizens regardless of party
At the same time, as I said before, I have been
long enough in the ranks of the Republican
party Â».o make my friends confident that I
shall te true to my Republican colleagues, but
1 shall look after the general interest* to the
bent of my ability.
X don't know what the platform is and I
generally want to know what I am indorsing,
but I know that tha Republican party has not
presented anything to you In its platform that
I cannot indorse. I am satisfied without
knowing that they have presented principles
that if we live ud to and right for during this
election, and arter the election, will give satis
faction to the people; therefore I am ready to
Indorse it without reading any of the princi
ples that are promulgated in your platform.
In conclusion he thanked the conven
tion for the honor conferred upon him,
and said he was willing to receive the
indorsement of all other clubs and organ
izations, but proposed, nevertheless, to
maintain bis allegiance to tbe Republican
party, which, he said, was the party of
protection, and would go forward to vic
tory in November under the leadership of
that grand banner-bearor Irom Ohio, Wil
liam McKinley.
Three cheers were given for Colonel C.
L. Taylor, the regular Republican nomi
nee for Mayor of San Francisco, and the
convention adjourned until this evening
at 8 o'clock. Nominations will then be
continued in the selection of a Treasurer,
Superintendent of Streets and municipal
judicial officers.
After the onvention adjourned dele
gates of the Forty-second Assembly Dis
trict convened and selected Lorenzo
Henry as their nominee for the Assembly.
Henry is a printer and a native son. fie
has occupied positions in the State
Printer's office during two terms and is
now following his profession here.

There has been of late considerable talk
in Democratic and other anti-Republican
newspapers to the effect that there is a
division of greater or less extent in the
ranks of the Republicans of this City, so
far as local offices are concerned. The
Democratic papers have gloated over the
fact and have espoused the cause of the
small fraction of people who have been
dragged into the circus by the false pre
tenses of Martin Kelly and his side part
ner, Senator Mahoney. They do this
because by bolstering the weak cause of
the usurpers they hope to make the divi
sion permanent.
The few henchmen of Martin Kelly,
who, by the by, is being treated with great
consideration by the Examiner, which not
long ago denounced him as a boodler and
a ruffian, are making considerable noise
with a few loud voices for the purpose of
inducing the belief in tbe minds of the
people that ttie regular Republican County
Committee and the County Convention
were unauthorized bodies and usurpers.
Iv order to set the matter in its true
light and in order that the peopie who are
entitled to know may be advised as to the
merits of the case, a Call reporter yester
day interviewed several lawyers of high
standing In this City as to the legal posi
tion of the Republican committee of which
Mr. Manwaring is chaiiman and of the
Republican County Convention of which
Thomas D. Riordan is chairman. They
nave staked their reputations as lawyers
on tbe soundness of the opinions advanced
by them, and for that reason those
opinions arc entitled to tbe respectful con
sideration of the people.
Judge S. C. Denson, one of the best
known lawyers in the State of California,
said:
"The regular Republican County Con
vention, of which the Hon. Thomas D.
Riordan is chairman, was called by the
regular County Central Committee, which
derives its title and claims its genealogy
for years back as the controlling body of
the Republican parjy in this County. 1
know of no reason way it should not be
recognized as thrj legal organization in
control.
"i understand that its authority is ques
tioned only by some gentlemen who were
elected delegates, or who claim to have
been elected delegates, to tbe National
Convention at St. Louis, and wbo were
recognized as such by the National Com
mittee and the National Convention; bin
I don't understand tnat, under party law
or usage, such delegates nave any juris
diction over county, State or municipal
affairs. They are simply creatures of the
Congressional district convention, and
nothing else.
"I don't know what authority they have
in the district where I live greater than
tnat exercised by the County Central Com
mittee ofâ say Aiameda County, or of any
other district, Congressional or otherwise.
If they have any authority from the Forty
first District, in whif h I reside, I know of
no reason why the delegates of the South
ern Congressional District, or of any other
district in the State, should not also claim
iike authority. In short, Ido not under
stand that they have any such authority
at all.
"Tbe Fourth Congressional District
Convention having performed its duties
within its powers has become functus
officio, or dead to the world to use a
homely phrase. Its only remaining power
would be to fill whatever vacancies may
occur in its Congressional or Presidential
electoral nominations."
Thomas D. Riordan said :
"In the first place, conceding for the
sake of the argument that the decision of
the National Committee seating Messrs.
Spear and Kowalsky was correct, all that
committee decided was that the conven
tion which nominated those gentlemen as
National delegates was the legal conven
tion of the Fourth Congressional District.
A Congressional district convention is
formed for the purpose of electing dele
gates at large to the National Convention,
Congressmen, Presidential electors, State
Commute men, and there its duties and
powers cease.
"Now, the Kelly and Mahoney people
claim that the Fourth District Congres
sional Convention can go further than
that simply because they inserted the
words 'and such other business as may be
brought before it, 1 but those words appear
in every call, and the fact that this phrase
is inserted does not mean that they can
call a State convention or that two years
from now they can appoint a county com
mittee or anythiue else."
"The Fourth Congressional District
takes in only a little more than one half
of San Francisco, but it does not take in
all the wards, and they lie when they
make that statement, their claim rests
on the fact that the wards touch the
Fourth District, but there are only a few
bouses in that situation and not more
than ten votes. The vast area of terri- j
EX-JUDGE HENRY C DIBBLE of the Forty-First District, Regular
Republican Nominee for the Assembly*
tory included in the Fifth Congressional
District constitutes considerably more
than one-third of the City and County of
San Francisco.
"It has never been known in the his'ory
of either the Democratic or Republican
parties that the Congressional convention
bad power to call a municipal convention.
That power emanates from the County
Committee and from no other source.
This has been the rule and tbe precedent
oi both political parties from time imme
morial.
"Our convention was called by this
County Committee, elected two years ago,
and whose legality has never been ques
tioned and is not even now being ques
tioned. The powers of that committee
continue to exist until its successors are
elected and qualified. The two years of
the term of the County Committee have
not yet expired."
Judge Henry C. Dibble, on being asked
for his professional opinion on the sub
ject, replied:
"To my mind there can be no question
whatever as to the legality of the Repub
lican conveution presided over by Thomas
D. Riordan, and "the County Committee
of which Mr. Manwaring is chairman. It
is unquestionably the only legal County
Committee in existence. It has received
its powers by direct transmission from the
County Committee which preceded it, and
so on back through the history of the Re
publican party in San Francisco for many
years.
"At lhe last general election, in San
Francisco the candidates nominated by
tbe convention which constituted tbe
present County Committee were recognized
by the Election Commissioners, and were
placed upon the ticket as tbe regular nom
inees of tbe Republfcan party, and there
is no reason in the world why the nom
inees of tue present convention should not
be so regarded and treated by tne Registrar
and the Election Commissioners, aside
from any division that may or may not
exist among Republicans in San Fran
cisco.
"It seems to me to be beyond any ques
tion that the Main waring County Commit
tee is the only one in existence."
J. Aiva Watt said:
"The present County Committee, of
which Mr. Manwaring is chairman, is the
regular successor of its predecessor, tbe
County Committee which called into ex
istence the convention held in 1Â»94. That
County Committee was the successor of its
predecessors cabled into existence and or
ganized in the^ same manner during a
period of many years.
"The legal existence and authority of
the county committees so organized, ex
ioting and succeeding each other, has
never been questioned in the political his
tory of the btate. The line oi succession
is undisputed and cannot be attacked upon
any le^al ground, the proof of which is
that no attack has been made upon it, ex
cept by the present so-called Kelly-
Mahoney faction of the party, which fac-
John MÂ» Chretien.
tion is but a fraction even on paper, with
out support or backing of any consider
able number of Republicans of this City,
and which pretends to have organized for
municipal and county purposes.
"That pretense is founded upon the pro
ceedings had for the purpose of nominat
ing Congressmen and Presidential electors
in the several Congressional districts of
the State. Their organization had its in
ception in a call issued by the National
Committee for the election of delegates in
the several Congressional districts
throughout the whole country for the pur
pose of nominating Congressmen and
Presidential Electors. That call of itself
however, distinctly recognized the sepa
rate and legal existence of the State Cen
tral Committees in the different States,
and in this State the call was not consid
ered of itself operative, bnt was given
effect only through the action of the State
Central Committee in this State.
"At the time of the issuance of the call
of the National Committee there were no
existing Congressional committees save in
one district. The Fourth and Fifth Con
gressional districts were without Con
gressional committees. The State Central
Committee, in order to give effect to the
call of the National Committee, adopted
a resolution whereby the members of the
Btate Central Committee residing in the
several Congressional districts had dele
gated to them the power to select and
appoint the Congressional Committee for
each district, and by that means tbe ex
isting Congressional District Committees
were called into existence. No conflict as
to the selection of those Congressional
Committees occurred in any district in the
State, save in the Fourth.
"In tnat district, at two separate meet
ingaÂ«of the State Central Committeemen
residing therein, two separate Congres
sional committees were chosen and a con
flict arose as to which of those Congres
sional committees was regularly chosen.
"The purpose of the call of the National
Committee was aa I have stated, namely,
to provide for the nomination of Congress
men, Presidential electors and delegates to
the National Convention. The National
Convention recognized the election of
Messrs. Spear and Kowalsky as delegates
[to that convention, and they settled a
! matter that was within their power and
jurisdiction. It naturally followed that
the norn nees of the same convention for
Congressmen and Presidential electors
were legally and properly nominated, but
there the powers, duties and functions of
the Congressional convention ended and
that convention could not by its own acts
perpetuate its existence nor eniarge its
Dowers.
"Tiie Fourth Congressional District
constitute* but a fractional part of the
City and County of San Francisco. The
convention of that district had no power
to exercise any riehtg, duties or functions
whatever in the Fifth Congressional Dis
trict, which had its independent conven
tion.
"The Fifth Congressional District Con
vention of which I was and am the chair
man, having nominated its Congressman
and Presidential elector, adjourned to
the call of the chair. No meeting of that
convention, either of itself or jointly with
the Fourth Congressional District Con
vention, has ever since been called.
"The so-called Kelly-Mahoney County
Committee was appointed at an alleged
joint meeting of the Fourth and Fifth
Congressional districts, but since no such
joint meeting was ever called or held by
any legal authority, and sine* the alleged
source of authority never existed, it fol- I
lows that the Kelly-Mahoney County
Committee, so called, has not and never
had any legal existence.
"The Kelly-Mahoney convention gets
its pretended authority from an alleged j
County Committee called into existence
as above stated, but it can have no greater
or higher authority than that which called
it into existence, and it legitimately fol
lows, therefore, that it has uo legal exist
ence.
"If it should be claimed that the Con
gressional committees in the several Con- I
gressional districts in the State alone rep- !
resent the power and authority of the Re
publican party, it must follow that the
action of every county convention held
throughout the State under the auspices
and jurisdiction of the county committees
is illegal ana void, a-nd there has not been
a legal nomination for any Superior j
Judge, Assemblyman, Senator or other I
officer in the State. The statement of this
fact alone shows the ridiculous and pre- I
posterous nature of the pleas advanced by
the so-called Kelly-Mahoney faction. â 
"If the Fourth Congressional District had I
the power to call into existence a county I
committee, the Fiftn Congressional Dis- |
trict convention, which embraces a lame |
section of the City, had the same power j
and may still be called upon to exercise 1
the same functions and have tbe same
power as is vested in the Congressional
district conventions and the entire Fiftn !
District is entitled to participate therein i
and it would follow that we would be !
obliged to call in the delegates from the I
counties of San Mateo and Santa Clara
which constitute a part of the Fifth Dial
trict, to participate in the proceedings
leading up to the nomination of a muni
cipal convention in the City of San Fran
cisco."
John M." Chretien gave his opinion as
follows:
"Ever since the Republican party was
organized in this Count 3' the municipal
convention has been recognized by a cer
tain number of people who composed the
County Committee. The County Commit
tee is the body which calls the convention
for the purpose of electing delegates to the
municipal convention, which, in turn,
would nominate otneers for the municipal
election. That county convention, while
in session, would name the successors of
that body which had called them together,
and the people whom they elected were
to serve until their successors qualified.
"Following that rule and principle iaid
down by Democrats and Republicans
alike, two years ago the Republican
County Convention, which was presided
over by Mr. Watt, named the County
Committee. After they had done so they
adjourned sine die. They were then dead
and out of existence. This County Com
mittee were the sole arbiters of the quali
fications of its members. They could in
crease or diminish their numbers, and ex
pel or suspend anybody that they wanted
tom their County Committee by a majority
vote. Tneir term of office does not expire till
January 1, 1897, and until that time they
are the only successors ot the County Com
mittees that have existed during the past
twenty years. They have the books, the
archives and other property handed down
by their predecessors. They call the
county convention which names their suc
cessors, and, whether they name Uie same
men or new men has nothing to do with
any National party or any State Central
Committee, nor with any members of the
National Committee from Maine, or II
linoi3, or Nebraska, because, while we are
Republicans, we believe in State rights to
this extent, that no combination of men
from different States and territories of the
United States can direct or dictate who
shall be the Coroner of this City and
County, or who shall be the County Com
mittee.

IN ONE NIGHT
Mr. Bryan's Husky Voice
Sounds to Thousands
in Brooklyn.
GLAD HE'S A DEFENDER.
Attacks the Supreme Court for
Its Decision on the
Income Tax.
GHOST OF LINCOLN INVOKED.
His Opponents Remind Him of the
Man Who Feared He Would
Get Justice.
BROOKLYN, N. V., Sept. 23.â William
Jennings Bryan, the Democratic candi
date for President, delivered three
speeches to-night. The first was in the
Academy of Music, the next to an over
flow meeting, and later he addressed a
large gathering of laboring men In tne
upper part of the city.
A solid mass of humanity packed the
Academy of Music It was crowded fully
an hour before the beginning of the meet
ing. The doors were closed and thousands
turned away. The streets surrounding
the academy were blocked with a dis
appointed throng, who struggled and
fought to gain admittance to see the
Democratic standard-bearer.
When Chairman James D. Bell took his
seat on the speakers' stand at 8 o'clock
there were in the hall over 5000 people.
There was a fair sprinkling of ladies
present.
Among those who sat on the stage were
Elliott Danforth (chairman of the State
Committee), Mr. Blackburn of Kentucky
and Colonel Thompson (ex-Congressman
from Kentucky). Judge Gaynor of this
city was chairman. The audience cheered
bim to the echo.
Mr. Bryan was escorted to the theater
by ex-Congressman Clancy and B. J.
York of the Kings County Democratic
Committee. He remained in an ante
room until his turn came to speak.
After preliminary remarks in which
Judge Gaynor said that in this campaign
the Democracy would not be wanting for
leaders. Senator McCarren was intro
duced. He read a resolution, which was
adopted with rousing cheers, pledging the
Democrats of Kings County to the
earnest and uncompromising support of
Bryan and Sewall. When the names of
Senator Quay and Mr. Platt, both of
whom were sarcastically alluded to in the
were heard there were hisses,
while load groans followed the mention
of Chairman Mark Hanna's name.
Then Mr. Bryan suddenly appeared.
He had become tired of waiting for the
preliminaries to end, and, with Bernard
J. York, entered the stage from the rear
and walked calmly down the narrow aisle
formed by the sitting and standing
people. A mighty shout went up. The
audience seemed to rise as one man. In
one instant men were shouting with all
the power of their lungs, and as nearly
everybody was provided with a small
American flag these were waved in the air
until the whole audience seemed to be a
kaleidoscope of red. white and blue.
Those who did not participate at first
soon became enthused and rose and
cheered with their more emotional neigh
bors. It was a Biirring scene. Order was
finally restored after the cheering had
lasted many minutes. The crowd wanted
to bear Bryan and Bryan alone, so his
introduction was brief.
"We will dispense with the formal parts
of the meeting and I will now introduce
to you your great leader, Mr. Bryan," said
the chairman.
That was all the Judge said. His last
words were drowned in the roar that came
from every part of the house, and as the
band played "Rally Hound the Fla^" the
people had a new incentive to shout.
When quiet was restored Mr. Bryan spoke
as follows:
If you don't stop, if you don't preserve
order, our opponents will say you are agaiust
order as well as against law. I esteem it a
great privilege to be permitted to defend a
cause which I have espoused in this campaign,
and I urn Kiad to be permitted to present that
cause to the people of Brooklyn. I only wish
that that great divine whose name has added
even to the fame of your great city, Henry
Ward Beecher [applause], were with us to-iay
that be might again champion the cause of the
people in their great fight.
Beiore addressing myself to tne money ques
tion 1 desire to say something in regard to the
planks of our platform which have been
assailed by the enemy. I only speak of them
because persons hiifh in the Republican party
have called attention to them and sought to
twist them into a meaning never intended and
to give them an interpretation which they will
cot bear.
Mr. Bryan then read the plank denoun
cing Federal interference, and declared it
as mild in tone when viewed by the side
of the plank on the inviolability of State
rights in the Lincoln platform of 1860.
Continuing Mr. Bryan said:
Now, my friends, if our platform is wrong, I
want theEe Republicans to reiiUdiate Abraham
Lincoln. [Applause.] Because if you take
Abraham Lincoln from the Republicuu party,
you nave taken from it its most sacred
memory. [Applause.] Now let me call your
attention to another thing they complain of.
They fay we criticize the Supreme Court. Let
me read you what we say on that subject.
The speaker quoted the plank in the
Chicago platform denouncing the Supreme
Court for its decision against the income
tax, and continued:
What cri!ici6m is there? I call attention to
the fact that the court overruled the decisions
of a hundred years. We dec-are that Congress
ought to use all the constitutional power "that
remains. Let them insist that having taken
part we dare nnt u*e what they have leit. We
demand that Congress shall use such power as
stay come irom a reversal by the court as it
may hereaiur be consiituted. Has no court
bereuHtr a right to reverse the decision of this
court? If not, what right had this court to
reverse the courts for 100 years before it?
[Applause.] This court changes from time to
unit. Judges die or resign and new Judges
take their places. Is it not possible, my
friends, thut future Judges may adhere to the
precedents of a century instead of adhering to
a decision rendered by a majority of one, and
that one changed his mind in two months?
Every time a lawyer goes into court and asks
for a reversal of a decision of the court â and it
is not an infrequent tn ingâ every time a iaw
yr does itâ he attacks the correctness of the
decision which he desires to have reversed.
1 et me read to you what tne Republican plat
form siid about decisions of the Supreme Court
in 1860:
\\<- condemn the recent opening of the African
slave trade under tee cover of our flag,
aided by perversions of judicial power.
That is what the platform saidâ it declared
that a decision of the court was a perversion of
judicial power. Tiere is no language in our
platform ti.at is as harsh on the Supreme Court
rb t ha Republican platform. [Applause.]
My fneii'ls, on these two questions, on which
we arc assailed by the KÂ»-pubiicans to-day, we
have not taken as emphatic a stand as the Re
sin party took in the first platform upon
which it elected h President of the United
States. I^t me read to you now what Abraham
Lincoln caid about the Supreme Court. This is
from his inaugural address:
tdo not forget the position assumed by some
that constitutional questions are to be decided by
ri iâ¢ lpreme Court; nordoldeny thai such ae
clsons must be binding in any case upon parties
10 the sun as to the object of that suit.
.u The Â« next was quoted, and
then Mr. Bryan said :
Mr Lincoln says that if it is meant to be as
seneu that the Supreme Court has a right to
determine the policy of the people on great
questions that they will have cssigned our
Government into the hands of the Bupreme
court. Our platform is not as- harsh as the
language of Abraham Lincoln.
I quote these authorities, my friends, m
order that you may all see how far-fetched is
the criticism that is leveled against us. I quote
these in order that you may see that the very
men who used the criticisms against us must,
in order to do so, abandon the Republican
platform upon which Lincoln was elected.
[Applause.] Now our opponents say that we
are opposed to the enforcement of the law. I
deny it. I stand as the candidate of three
parties. Ido not speak of myself as an indi
vidual, because the individual is lost in a cam
paign In the representative character of the
candidate. But, my friends, I want to say to
you that the fear that is expressed is not a fear
that if elected that I will not enforce the law.
I have said it before and I say it again, that if
by the suffrages of my countrymen I am placed
in that position which is the highest position
in the gift of the people of the world, every
law shall be enforced against the great as well
as against the small. [Applause.]
It is not a fear of lawles.-ness, my friends.
Think of men who have transgressed the law
being afraid that there will be a lax enforce
ment of the law. Think of the men who have
considered themselves greater than the Gov
ernment who are afraid the Government will
not be great enough. They remind me ol the
man in courtâ the person who seemed uneasy â
and the Judge assured him that he bad noth
ing to fear; that ne would get justice in that
court, and he said: "Great heavens, Judge,
that's what I'm afraid of." [Applause.} They
say that we have been the peculiar objects of
these imputations. We pause, therefore, for a
moment to repel them.
We entertain no sentiments diverse to social
order; we seek not to destroy, but to preserve
in their purity the institutions of our country,
whose language is the language of Samuel J.
Tilden [applause], used in an address to farm
ers, workinzmen and mechanics delivered on
February t>, 1883. They accused reformers
then of being destroyers of the peace, and he
asserted then, as we assert now, that we have
not come to destroy. Let me read from that
speech of Tildeu's: "A powerful moneyed cor
poration, engaged in a death struggle with the
Government to whom it owed its existence,
assailed the purity of our press. A mighty
combination of politicians and moneyed inter
ests is again in the field to control elections, to
change the administration of Government and
to re-establish the supremacy of the great
moneyed corporations over the business of the
country."
That same moneyed power exists to-day. It
is doing this same work to-day that it did in
the days of Tilden, and business men are ter
rified. Tilden said that the patriotism of the
people prevailed in that struggle, and I be
lieve it will in this. To think otherwise would
be to despair of a government like this. My
friends, we cannot have a free government un
less the people are free to act. I repeat, my
friends, that this government by the lew, this
government by asserted wealth, this govern
ment by corporations, is the most tyrannical
government that any people ever suffered
under. [Applause.] When you know that I
am opposed to a government by the few; that
I am opposed to a government by the great
corporations, you will understand why they
call me an anarchist.
I want for a few moments to call your atten
tion to the present financial system, and ex
plain to you what we desire to substitute for
it. Now the present financial system is based
upon gold. The present financial system con
templates the retirement of greenbacks and
treasury notes and the substitution of bank
paper for those notes. The present financial
system contemplates the retirement of all
iegal tender silver certificates, contemplates
gold only as the legal tender money of this
country, and bank paper only as the paper
money of the country. The financial policy
under which we now suffer, therefore, contem
plates a condition in which a few men will
control the gold money and the national
banks will control the paper money, and the
people will have nothing to say about it. Mr.
Carlisle, iv a recent letter, says that it is the
duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to re
deem silver dollars in gold whenever it be
comes necessary to do so, in order to maintain
the parity.
What does all that mean? It means that all
this talk about retiring greenbacks and treas
ury notes is a farce, and when this farce gives
out they intend to start another endless chain
as soon as they get through with the present
endless chain.
We have got to have either one kind of
standard money or two kinds. If we cannot
have two kinds then ii must be one, and the
Government must have the right to use a stiver
dollar. If the Government cannot use a silver
dollar to pay all the debts that it owes then
the silver dollar is not as good as the gold dol
lar. I believe this Government has a right to
use its silver dollars as it uses its gold dollars;
but our opponents have gone on a different
theory, and they have taxed the people of this
country to pay interest on $226,000,000 in
bonds in order to buy gold, on the theory that
silver was not as good as gold.
My friends, when I see bonds worth $119
sold for $1 04?*. and try to describe what kind
of a transaction it was I regret that my
parents did not teach me more tongues in
which to express my- ideas. And yet the peo
ple who sell for $1 04% bonds worth
$1 19 assume that they are the only people
who understand financiering. I believe that
instead of the Secretary of the Treasury get
ting down on his knees and asking these men
to please tell him what he ought to do he
ought to stand up and with 70.000,000 of peo
ple behind him tell them what they ought
to do and make them do it. You say that it
is not impossible. The great trouble has been,
in my judgment, that our Treasury officials,
instead of being in sympathy with the mass of
the people of the United States^ have been in
sympathy with the syndicates and financiers
of the United States.
Our platform declares for the double stand
ard without discrimination or charee for
mintage. Our platform is but a reiteration of
the main part of the platform of 1892 without
the steps. [Laughter.] We left tne steps off
because the candidate did not care to step
down this time. [Great applause.] Our plat
form is not made simply that they may get in
on it, but it is made to sthnd on after election.
I am in favor of tree coinage whether we
produce silver in this country or not. I am in
favor o: the use of silver, not because we
produce, but because we own it. [Applause.]
If w2 ueed it, and if it is best for urn at our
present ratio, I am in favor of having it even
if to have it gives the people who produce
silver a chance to <io what they did beiore the
law struck silver down.
They tell you that free coinage helps those
who delve in the mines Admitted. I tell you
that when they bring out that metal they
pour it into the channels of trade, ana we are
blessed by its discovery. [Applause.] Who
will be helped by the gold standard? Not
those who produce the metal and pour it into
the channels of trade, but those who corner
the money of the world and keep it out of the
channels. [Applause.]
Mr. Bryan then went over his favorite
argument of Bismarck and bimetallism,
and said:
Shame on the cowardly American who
thinks this Nation is not as big as Bismarck
thinks it is !
When Mr. Bryan concluded he was
cheered loudly. He presented Senator
Blackburn, asking the audience to listen
to him. Most of the audience remained.
The journey of Mr. Bryan from Phila
delphia to Hoboken was marked by
gatherings at nearly every railroad station.
He made a number of speeches, one of
forty five minutes at Washington, N. J.,
ana others of brief duration. Most of his
addresses were cur short by the train
movina out. The stops were frequent but
very brief. Mr. Bryan's appearance was
almost invariably cheered. He was for
tunate on such a "busy day in having cool
weather, and on his arrival at Hoboken
showed none of the fatigue that has fol
lowed his campaigning during the hot
season.
AT REPUBLIC AN H EADQUARTERS.
Notable Visitors iron*. Many Mates
Bring Encouraging Sews.
CHICAGO, IIL., Sept. 23.-* John Sher
man was a notable visitor at Republican
National headquarters to-day. He stopped
in Chicago on his way home from a trip to
Montana and Colorado, taken for rest, and
he was induced to address the noon-hour
meeting of the Commercial McKinley
Club No. 1 at the clubrooms. He will
make some speeches in Ohio and other
States, but he is not physically able to do
much active campaigning. He addressed
two meetings in Montana, and ne told
Chief Hahn of the speakers' bureau that
be was surprised to find so many Republi
cans in Colorado, where he had been told
everybody was for silver.
Senator Manderson of Nebraska, who
has been here trying a lawsuit, returns
home to-night to engage in campaign
work. He will accompany tho Alter party
through Nebraska the first of October and
will contine his speaking to Nebraska on
account of his professional engagements.
General Manderson said to a reporter of
the United Associated Press at National
headquarters:
. "The Republicans in our section are
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1896.
earnest and vigorous and aggressive. I
hope rather than have confidence that we
will carry Nebraska by a small majority.
This talk about Bryan carrying every State
west of the Missouri River is all bosh. I
told Mr. Hanna when I was in New York
that he must not depend on any State
west of the Missouri. Thpre is lots of sil
ver sentiment in my State."
The Bismarck letter has made an im
pression at headquarters, but there is a
disinclination on the part of the commit
teemen to discuss it from the Republican
point of view. Chairman Payne's opinion
is that if the German ex-Chancellor has
any interest in the election of Bryan it is
based on the tariff and not on the currency
question. Mr. Payne supports this opin
ion by the statement that the Democratic
tariff legislation repealed the sugar bounty,
which placed Germany at a disadvantage
of 2 cents a pound, and destroyed the in
dustry in low-grade knit woolen goods,
which Germany has a monopoly of in
trade with this country. In all the inter
national monetary conferences, Mr. Payne
said, Bismarck has always thrown his in
fluence against an extension of the use' of
silver, and has always been the strongest
gold man in European politic.
The new programme was received from
ex-Governor Hughes of Phoenix, Ariz.
He states that the Republican Territorial
Convention had declared that while Ari
zona was friendly to silver it was per
fectly willing to trust its silver interests to
the Republican party.
Ex-Governor Fiferof Illinois called and
reported the situation improving steadily
in this State, and in his ex ensive speak
ing tour among the farmers he had not
found the silver sentiment which had
been claimed by the Democrats.
VIRGINIA DEMOCRATS.
Sound-Money Talk at Jltchrnond Re
ceived With Cheers and Hisses.
RICHMOND, Va., Sept. 23.â The meet
ing in this city to-night under the auspices
of the cold Democrats, and at which Gen
eral Buckner, Colonel John R. Fellows of
New York and Governor O'> were
announced to speak, was a success in
point of numbers. The Academy of Mu
sic was crowded to its utmost capacity,
but before the speaking wae over the
mingling of hisses and cheers evidenced
that in its financial views the audience
was greatly divided. Bryan's name was
cheered whenever mentioned.
Colonel Fellows did not reach the city,
but General Buckner arrived this after
noon.
Governor O'Ferral presided over the
meeting. The Governor's address was an
important event of the evening, as he had
but recently given his adherence to the
Paimer-Buckner ticket. He said he was
a Democrat and that he had never cast
his ballot fur a man who was not a Demo
crat. But be found now that his party
1 had fallen upon evil times and its accred
ited representatives had forsaken the
true faith.
The Governor repudiated the charge of
being a bolter. When delegates sent to a
convention made a platform not Demo
cratic there was no rule, he said,
to require a Democrat to vote for that
platiorm. Suppose that he were techni
cally a boiter of the party, the Chicago
I convention had done worse, for it had
bolted Democratic principles. TheGover
j nor then introduced General Buckner in
I high terms of eulogy. General Buckner

DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN - BOOK.
Large Volume Just Compiled by Con
gressman McMillin of Tennessee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 23.âSen
ator Jones, chairman of the National Com
mittee, and Senator Faulkner, chairman
of the Democratic Congressional Commit
tee, called on Representative Benton Mc-
Millin of Tennessee about a month ago to
compile the material for the Democratic
campaign- book of 1896. He accepted the
task and has just finished the work. The
book begins with the admonition of Jeffer
son in his first inaugural address, to bow
to the will of the majority. It gives the
platform recommended by the committee
on resolutions of the Chicago convention,
the speech of Mr. Bryan and the notifica
tion speeches and letter ol acceptance. In
the first chapter it lays down the funda
mental principlesot the Democratic party,
as expounded* by Thomas Jefferson, Wil
liam Allen of Ohio, Governor Seymour of
New York and William Jennings Bryan.
It devotes a hundred pages to the silver
question and the "crime of 1873."
Another chapter takes up Governor Mc-
Kinley's public record on the subject of
silver, Chinese immigration, th-; force bill
and his tariff law. Jefferson, Monroe and
Cleveland are quoted on tne Monroe doc
trine. A chapter on ti.e income tax gives
Bryan's speech in the House on that sub
ject, the report of the committee, Mr.
Wicke's speech, the dissenting opinions of
the chairman and Senator Vest's review
of the whole subject.
The book produces in full Mr. Bryan's
Labor day speech at Chicago. The volume
makes about 350 pages.
DEMOCRATIC COMFORTS.
Doubtful Western state* and. a Solid
South Claimed for Bryan-
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 23.â Hon. William
R. Morrison, chairman of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, held a conference
to-day with Chairman Jones of the Demo
cratic National Committee. Mr. Morrison
is giving his hearty support to the Bryan
and Sewall ticket, and might make some
speeches during the campaign.
Hn, Ruth E. Plumb, widow of the late
United States Senator from Kansas, sent
$50 to the campaign fund.
Mayor Thomas Taj;gart of Indianapolis
and a member of the State committee, re
ports that State safe for Bryan by 30.000
majority, and his estimate is agreed to by
Governor Matthews. A canvass of Mis
souri by the Democratic State Committee
is said to have resulted, according to (he
report of Chairman Cook, in tx showing
for Bryan carrying the State by 100,000.
The headquarters opinion is that fusion
1 with the Populists in Kentucky and North
Carolina removes any doubt of tue South
being solid for Bryan in NovÂ«mber, and
they claim the same result from fusion in
Illinois and Wyoming.
BISHOP McC ABE'S FIEWS.
Opposed to Free Silver and Hopes to See
McKinley Elected.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Sept. 23.â Bishop J.
B. McCabe, who has just concluded the
Methodist conference at Hastings, was
asked what effect the political contest was
having on the progress of the church and
said:
"The interests of the church are almost
identical with those of the Nation. I oe
lieve it would subserve the interests of the
church if McKinley should be elected. As
to the present campaign, I think the piat
form that has been adopted by the Demo
cratic party in the Chicago convention
very unwise. The assault upon Pr sident
Cleveland for that act of his administra
tion which showed him to be a patriot,
namely, the using of United States troops
to put down the rebellion in Chicago, is
unpatriotic in the extreme. The Gov
ernor of Illinois refused the State troops
for that purpose and the Mayor of Chi
cago was dilatory. The President arose
to the emergency and did the right thing."
Bishop McCabe said he was opposed to
free silver and he believed a majority of
the Methodist ministers also were.
UNION VETERANS PROTEST.

LINCOLN, Nebe., Sept. 23.â At a meet
ing of the Veteran Soldiers' Bryan Club of
Lincoln the following resolution was to
day adopted:
Resolved, That while we respect our old com
rades and commanders. Generals Sigel, Sick
les and others, for their courage and valor, we
do not recognize their authority or wisdom in
their attempt to control or direct the votes of
those who inarched in the ranks, whose equal
valor and courage placed the wreaths ol laurel
upou the brows of their commanderÃ. We be
lieve that as citizens we are competent to de
cide for ourselves. Further, that we are more
loyal to the old flag than are those who con
sent to the control by foreign nations of our
finances.
THE "CRIME OF '78."
Senator Sherman Defends the Position
Taken by His Party.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Sept 23. â The
Cincinnati Post publishes to-day a letter
from Senator Sherman, emanating from
the National Republican campaign com
mittee, defending the position his party
took in the so-called "Crime of '73." Mr.
Sherman declares:
"I have never been able to see what
motive could have existed for secrecy in
this matter. There was no indication
whatever of the fall of silver and no one
could foresee that it was destined to rap
idly decline in price. No one asked to
have the dollar coined and no one was op
posed to its discontinuance.
"To prove that there was no secrecy and
not leave the matter to argument or in
lerence, copies of the bill were sent to ex
perts all over the country asking their
opinion, and answers were received and
laid before Congress in printed form, in
which the discontinuance of the silver
dollar was thoroughly discussed. The
bill was printed thirteen times and extra
copies were printed for distribution. It
was conned over, amended and debated
almost as copiously as any measure ever
considered in Congress, and no man in
either house proposed to retain the old
silver dollar. The fact that it was omit
ted from our coins was referred to in
debate."

Editor Charles X. Matthews of the Non
conformist, the National Populist organ,
returned to-day from St. Louis, where hfa
attended the conference of Populists. He

BAD LUCK OF THE PERRY
Loses a Number of Seamen and
Suffers Damage to Her
Machinery.
Ciptain Hooper's R ports of His S a
son's Operations in the Bering
Sea.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 23.â a re
port was received at the Treasury Depart
ment to-day from Captain C. L. Hooper,
in command of the Bering Sea fleet, dated
Unalaska, in which he says:
The Perry has been singularly unfortunate'
this season. In addition to her machinery
giving out, she lias lost a number of men. I
inclose herewith Captain Smith's recount of
the accidental death of seaman C. C. Moul- j
throp, who fell from the main truck to the
quarter deck of the Perry, on July 16, and was
Instantly killed. Moulthrop was the man who !
jumped overboard from the Perry at the risk
of his life and saved the lives of three of his
shipmates, in the early spring.
The cause of the accident was possible heart
trouble, brought on by the exertion of cli>nb
ing up to the main truck. Dr. Kieruiff in
formed me that the man was subject to slight
attacks of loss of mu.-cular power after over
exertion. Moulthrop was an American, a
native of Massachusetts. Captain S<mith will
communicate with his friends or'relatives, ill
the address of any such can be found among
his effects. He was buried at Unalaska, on
July 17, with military honors.
The death of this native is the subject of !
deep regret in the fleet. An effort is being i
made to raise money for a marole monument j
to his memory.
A later report, dated Unalaska, August
27, was also received from Captain Hooper
to-day, in which he says:
I forward by the Homer a report of the seiz
ure of the American schooner Jane Gray and
the BritiÂ«h schooner Viva. The former goes '
to San Francisco and the latter has been or- i
dered to proceed to Victoria by the British
naval officer to whom she was turned over. I
send the Jane Gray to San Francisco because
it is her home port, and because it is more
convenient for our witnesses than Puget
Sound or Alaska. She has been seized so muny
times that she seems to have acquired the!
habit. I sent a report by the mail steamer up
to the 20th, and, with the exception of the
seizures, there is nothing new to report. The
season is an unusually windy one and poor for
sealing. The average catch to date is far be
low that of last year, and all agree that pelaeic
sealing is no longer a paying investment. Un
less other seizures are made, this is the last
chance to send mail before the season ends
and the fleet returns home.
WHEAT PRICES ADVANCE.
Rome and Foreign < , < Tend to
Strengthen- the Mark-t.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 23.â The price of
wheat, which advanced to-day, was at
tended by considerable excitement. From
the opening of the session until the final
trades were made the course was con
tinually higher. A few minor reactions
took place, but they indicated no abate
ment of the bullish sentiment. The
strong feeline which culminated in
to-day's flurry was ol some days' develop
ment.
The Northwest has been sending bullish
advices of the yield of spring wheat, ac
companied by reports of an improved de
mand for flour. Foreign markets have
been advancing, and the crops of Eu
ropean countries are in many instances
decid dly short.
Iv vi w of these facts the belief that the
world's supplies will be inadequate to the
consumption during the coming year finds
many adherents, wno nre determined to
profit by the situation. December wheat
opened this morning from 62% c to 63c
and advanced to 65c, the gain over yester
day being 2%c per bushel.

GOES TO COURT
Four San Fraijciscans Sued
for Heavy Damages in
Boston.
REFUSED TO SELL STOCK
The Rawhide Mine of Tuolumne
County the One in Liti
gation.
CLAIMS OF AGENT PINNEY.
Plaint ffj Wanted to Take All the
Stock, Which Was Valued at
$1,500,000.
BOSTON, Mass, Bept 23.â The action
brought by Charle3 W. Norton of this city
against William A. Melville, William H.
Martin and John Ballard of San Francisco,
to recover $750,000 damages, was heard in
the equity session of the Superior Court
to-day by Judge Dunbar on a demurrer
which the defendants filed to the plain
tiff's declaration.
The suit is brought because of the re
fusal of defendants, who were the original
owners of what now constitutes the Raw
hide Gola Mining Company's property, in
Tuolumne County, California, to perform
a contiact which the plaintiff alleges he
made with them March 23, 1896, through
their agent, George M. Pinney, to buy the
full company stock of the gold mining
company, 100,000, for 11,500,000, at the rate
of $15 a share.
The plaintiff's agreement to purchase
the stock, it is set forth, was made with
Pinney in his name. Under this agree
ment the plaintiff was given the right to
take the entire stock at the rate of $15 a
share, or $1,500,000 for all the shares, by
paying the latter sum into the National
Bank of the Republic in this city, where
the certificates of stock were to be depos
ited in pursuance of a contract which the
defendants made with Pinney.
The Rawhide Gold Mining Company is
a West Virginia corporation. The de
fendants, as the owners of the property,
made an agreement with Pinney on Sep
tember 23, 1895, and a supplemental
agreement on September 30, 1895,
under which he was to act in
the relation of promoter to sell the
stock. He was to dispose of it for not less
than a minimum price, which was to be
fixed by the defendants, and for cash.
His contract retained him in this relation
to them for a year after it was made.
The defendants deposited certificates for
100,000 shares in the National Bank of the
Republic for Pinney to sell and fixed the
minimum price at which he was to sell
them at $15 a share, lie was to receive a
commission of 5 per cent. On March 23,
1896, he made the contract for the bread
of which the plaintiff sues, the defendants
having repudiated this contract on April
1, 1896.
The defendants' demurrer was argued
by the council, Mr. Solomon. Messrs.
Gaston & Snow appeared for the plaint
iff. The defendants contend that the
declaration does not make it appear that
Pinney was their agent to make the kind
of agreement which the plaintiff relies
upon.
They say it appears from their contract
with Pinney, which the plaintiff sets out,
that Pinney was authorized to sell the
stock only for cash. They further say
that the contract between Pinney and the
plaintiff does not purport to be made by
Pinney for them. They say also that the
declarations make it appear that the
plaintiff is able to perform his part of the
contract; that no tenders of money or
stock were made by the plaintiff.

Auction stuff, but good standard garments.

upon any excuse or pretext, she would
have to face that combination; and that

MENDOCINO POLITICS
Republican* Waging an Aggressive Cam-

MENDOCINO, Cal., Sept. Mendo
cino County has during the past few
weeks placed itself on record as being
strongly in favor of \\ illiam MeKinley
and protection â protection to American
industries and protection to American
labor. The Hon. J. W. Johnston, late of
Nebraska, and Hon. George A. Sturtevant
of Ukiah have been making a campaign
tour of this county, speaking in every
town and cross roads. They have met
with the most fluttering reception in all
the towns along their route. Men,
women and children are showing the
greatest interest in the great questions
that are being discussed.
Mr. Sturtevant speaks on finance and
Mr. Johnston on protection and other is
sues. Both are forcible and logical speak
ers, who understand their subjects per
fectly and present strong argument?,
backed by Government statistics. Re
cently they spoke in this place to the
largest and most enthusiastic audience
ever gathered here. Teams from adjoin
ing towns began to arrive oefoie 7 o'clock,
coming as far as fifteen miles, loaded with
voters. Cheer upon cheer was given for
McKinley, Hobart and protection as they
drove into and through the town.
At 7:30 o'clock the streets were lined
with people following the largest torch
light procession ever formed in Mendocino

NAPA MURDERER
William Moore's Story Is
Discredited at Los
Angeles.
ACTS AS THOUGH CRAZY
His Confession May Bj Only the
Fiction of a Diseased
Brain.
CAPTAIN GREENWOOD DOUBTS
Inclined to Disbelieve That the Saver
of His Wife Has Been
Captured.
Los Angeles Office of The Call,)
gijgg 328 South Broadway, V
Los Akgelks, Cal., Sept. 23.)
Sheriff Burr left here this afternoon for
i Napa, bavins; in charge William Moore,
I alias Crum, alias Daley, the self-confessed
j murderer of Mrs. Greenwood, in Napa, on
] February 9, 1891. Moore, or Crum, is a
: queer specimen of humanity, as' far as
i appearance goes. He loots the veritable
! hobo and has the stare of a maniac His
j "voluntary confession" is likely to turn
' out a hoax after all. Protracted drinking
has about done its fatal work with Moore.
To a Call correspondent the prisoner
\ talked in anything but a rational manner
I to-day. He would first deny and then
I confirm former statements attributed to
him in such rapid succession that nothing
1 could be made of his answers. He de
clared over and over again that he killed
I Mrs. Greenwood, and that Schmidt had
I nothing to do with it. He insists that the
â  newspapers have lied about him out*
â¢ rageously, and during the conversation
; came very nearly telling Sheriff Burr that
he had mixed things up in his talk to the
press.
It may turn out that; Moore is a barm
less idiot, crazed by the use of too much
bad liquor.
GREENWOOD IS SCEPTICAL
Honors That the Murderer of His Wife la
in Prison.
VALLEJO, Cal., Sept. 23.â Captain
John Greenwood was to-day shown the
statement of William Moore, who says he |
| killed the captain's wife. Mrs. Greenwood,
;on the night of February 9, 1891. Captain
! Greenwood doubts trie statement. He is
i quite certain of being able to identify tr.e
person if he has an opportunity of seeing
him. It is his* sincere hope that if Moore
I is the man that he claims to be he will be
tried and properly dealt with according to
law.
Captain Greenwood returned to . his
ranch this evening. As soon as the self
confessed murderer is brought to Napa he
will go there to identify him. The features
of the man are indelibly imprinted upon
his mind, and he thinks there will be no
likelihood of failure in identifying the
man who committed tbe crime if he has
really been captured.

DOOLAN'S EAR FOR MUSIC
It Doesn't Suit Hinrichs, Leader
of the Exposition
Band.
Military men ana military music pre
dominated at the Home Product Exposi
tion last evening. The attendance was
up to tbe average. During the afternoon
the Pavilion was turned over to the chil
dren of the public schools and their teach
ers.
The Knigbts of Pythias will attend the
fair this evening la full uniform.
Proud mothers, are getting their babies
in order for Babies' day, Saturday after
noon. Twelve valuable prizes will be given
for infants "possessing special merits. A
board of lady judges will bo selected.
There is a clash of authority between
the.nianugement of the institute and Gus
tav Hinrich, the leader of the orchestra.
It is believed to have been started on what
was called Irish night.
The leader was requested to play a num
ber of Irish melodies, but is said to have
ignored the request and selected instead a
few, Irish pieces that have lon outlived
! any interest. Then came German or
| Wagner night and bet one of the great
composer's productions; was rendered,
much to the annoyance of the manage
ment and the disgust of the attendance,
which was largely German.
The last straw was placed on French
night. Leader Hinricns was asked to
render a waltz specially composed by
Mile. Ilelene Thirion and dedicated to the
Native Sons and Daughters of French par
entage. It was entitled "En Flirtant."
Leader Hinrichs refused to play it.
Doolan Hew into a rage and expressed his
opinion of the situation in very forcible
language, and the male members of the
French colony took Leader Hinrichs'
action as an affront. It is said that several
of the lady composer's admirers will call
Leader Hinrichs to a personal account.
How the troublo will end in this direction
remains to be seen.
A meeting of the board of directors was
held which quickly turned into an indig
nation meeting. All the directors ex
pressed the opinion that where they pay
for the music they should have what ihey
want- Directors Doolan, Hsaley and Leu
gett roundly denounced Leader Hinrichs'
selections as being too classical, and Mr.
Hinrichs personally for failing to obey
orders.
The fight is not yet over and liveiy de
velopments may yet result fro:ai the clash.
The following musical programme will
be rendered to-day :
March, from "Rat Catcher of Hamlin" (Wess
ler; overture, "Si J'etals Koi" (Adam); waltz,

JUDGE GRANT'S ORDER.
Names December 18 as the Date
for the Condemned Striker's
Execution.
HIS FKIESDS ARE DILIGENT.
One Thousand Signers to a Petition
Praying for Executive
Clemency.
WOODLAND, Cal., Bept 23.-8. D.
Worden, who was convicted in the Super
ior Court of this county of derailing a
train and causing the death of Engineer
Clark with four soldiers during the great
railway strike of 1894, appeared before
Judge Grant to-day to be resentenced, the
former sentence being stayed by an appeal
to the Supreme Court. Although Worden
was pale and nervous, he seems to have
gained flesh during his long imprison
ment. He was accompanied into court
by his brother, Rev. W. S. Worden. He
listened very attentively to the remarks of
the court, who said :
"In this case the remittitur from the
Supreme Court of the State has been re
turned to and filed in this court, from
which it appears that the judgment here
tofore rendered herein has been affirmed.
The defendant being in court, it now only
remains for me to ask the question, 'Have
you any reason to show why at this time
the day should not be fixed for carrying
into execution the sentence already im
posed upon the defendant?' "
Mr. Bush of the counsel for tbe defense
said there were some matters that ought
to be urged in behalf of the defendant, but
he knew of no legal mode in which they
could be presented eitner to this court or
any other at the present time. He thought
they were such that when properly pre
sented and properly considered they would
prooably operate in favor of the defendant.
He asked that a continuance be granted.
Judge Grant denied the motion and or
dered that the sentence of death formerly
passed by the court be put into execution at
the State prison at Folsom on the 18th day
of DecenTber, 1896. Tbe prisoner will be
taken back to Folsom to-morrow. The
petition now being circulated by his
brother, asking that his sentence be com
muted to imprisonment, has about 1000
signatures.
MILES AT PORT TOWNSEND.
Continuing the Inspection of Comst For
tification Sites.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wabh., Sept. 23.â
Major-General Nelson A. Miles of the
United States army arrived this afternoon
and will spend several days in this vicinity
inspecting the sites of the fortifications
soon to be constructed for the proper pro
tection of Puget Sound. Accompanying
the commander is Major J. Van R. Hoff
and Captain E. Micbler, adjutant of his
personal staff. The visit to Port Town
send is only one feature of an extended
trip of inspection, which was decided
upon by the authorities some months ago.
It includes visits to all the principal army
posts of the United States, together with
the inspection of the different places se
lected for the placing of fortifications.
To-morrow, through the kindness of
Captain John B. Libby, manager of the
Puget Sound Tugboat Company, the dis
tinguished visitors, accompanied by mem
bers of the Board of Trade, will be taken
to visit Marrowstone, Wilson and Admir
ralty points, all of whu>h are to be forti
fied. General Miles will add pleasure to
business on the trip. He has with him his
guns and a hunting-dog, and the Protec
tion Island private game reserve will be
visited by the hunters at Captain Libby's
invitation, that they may bag some of the
handsome Japanese and other pheasant
that abound there. From here the general
and his party will go to San Francisco
overland.
SAUSALITO TRUSTEES ACT.
Mound the Iteathknell of So- Called
Commission- Houses.
SAUSALITO, Cal., Sept. 23.â The Board
of Trustees of Sausalito at a special meet
ing last night, after ordering extensive
street improvements, passed the following
resolution, which rings the deathknell of
poolrooms in Sausalito. It was introduced
by General Dickinson and unanimously
passed :
Eesolred, That the licenses taken out by cer
tain persons under the name of commission
houses and under which they claim the right
to conduct and are and have been conducting
the business of pool-selling, one and each of
them is. hereby revoked and canceled and re
' called, and the clerk is hereby directed to
notify any and all such persons of this reso
lution.
This action is taken because the Board
of Trustees is satisfied that such licenses
were obtained under false pretenses and
cave not been used for the conducting of
a legitimate business, as contemplated by
the ordinance, and the Town Attorney is
directed to take ail legal steps necessary
to enforce this resolution and stop such
business. Any and all applications fo rre
newal of licenses or for 'licenses to do a
commission business shall hereafter be
referred to and passed upon by the Board
of Trustees before being issued.
SANTA BARBARA'S GAIN.
Last Obstacle in the Way of a He%c Elec
tric Railway It'tnored.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Sept. 23.â A
deed was filed to-day in the office of the
County Recorder transferring to the new
Consolidated Electric Company all the
franchises and property of the Santa Bar
bara Street Railroad Company and the
Citizens' Railway Company. The con
sideration is $35,000 in 6 per cent gold
bonds, issued by the electric company.
This transfer removes the last obstacle
from the path of the new company, and,
while the old mule road virtually goes out
of existence, its owners become stock
holders in the new company.
With no more injunctions in its way the
electric company is hastening the com
pletion of connections along the line. The
power-house is already builf, the engine
Bet up and in running order, the trolley in
ulace und a portion of the rolling stock
already here. It is believed that Uie road
Will be opened early next wee*, affording
connection and fast transit between the
two extremities of the city.

SANTA CRUZ. Cal., Sept. 23.â Miss
Geraldine Mcyrick, authoress and poetess,
lelt to-day for Palo Alto, the home of her
mother. From there she goes to assume
the duties of private secretary to Mrs.
1 1 iff Warren and Bishop Warren of Uni

Santa Cruz is deeply deplored and leaves
a void in literary and social circles.
PORTLAND'S MURDER MISTERY.
The Death of William Jones Recalled by
a Detective' Suit.
PORTLAND, Ob., Sept. 23.â suit of
Detective Thompson; against the Everest
family of Newberg, Or., for services in try
ing to solve the William Jones murder
case and for exhuming Jones' remains to
see if he had been poisoned resulted in a
verdict for the defendants to-day.
The old murder mystery of Yamhill
County was given an airing again, but no
important evidence was brought out .as
was expected there would be, showing
whether old man Jones had been poi
soned, and if so by whom. The detective
asked for $1200, and heclaimed that in his
investigations of the circumstances of
Jones' death he found that the Everest
family, for whom he was working, was im
plicated.
The case was a peculiar one. Jones died
over four years ago, and the $17,000 in
cash he was supposed to have in his posses
sion at his death could not be found. His
heirs have been fighting over this ever
since, and have made charges and counter
charges of killing Jones for his money.
Certain of the heirs were strongly sus
pected, but. the evidence procurable did
not warrant arrests.
ACQUITTED AT FRESNO.
The Slayer of Alsxaniter Betbeder at
Firebaugh Goes Free.
FRESNO, Cal., Sept. 23.â Shortly after
noon to-day the jury in the Lambert mur
der case returned a verdict of not guilty,
and one of tbe most sensational trials in
the history of the county was brought to a
close.
John *W. Lambert, the defendant, shot
Alex Betbeder in a saloon row at Fire
baugh last May. Betbeder was in Lam
bert's 9sloon and became quarrelsome
from excessive drinking. Strong enmity
had existed between the men for a long
time, brought about by charges preferred
against Betbeder by Lambert in the
Knights of Pythias Lodge at Firebaugh,
because of alleged dishonesty and uu
brotherly conduct.
The quarrel was renewed in the saloon
the day. of the shooting, resulting in a
threat on the part of Betbeder to shoot
Lambert. The former drew a pistol from
his pocket at the same time. Lambert se
cured a revolver and an exchange of shots
ensued, Betbeder being killed. Public
sentiment has all along been with Lam
bert and his acquittal caused general sat
isfaction. The trial continued for two
weeks and some of the best legal talent in
the State participated.
WAY ON BUNG MAX BE NAMED.
Touted As the Future Chinese Minister
to Washington.
VICTORIA, B. a, Sept. 23.â There ap
pears to be likelihood, from what is being
said in Chinatown, that Wav On Bong,
the military attache who was in Victoria
some time ago awaiting the arrival of Li
Hung Chang from the East, may be the
next Chinese Minister to Washington.
When the Chinese Viceroy entered Van
couver, Wav On Bong was there to meet
him, and it is understood he requested his
Excellency to be appointed to some office
in a" foreign country in the Chinese diplo
matic service. Li Hung Chang asked
whether he would like a position of this
kind and Wav On Bong replied :
''Yes, I wish one if I can eet it"
To this Li Hung Chang remarked: "I
think I can get you one."
Sow it appears that the term for which
Yang Yu, Chinese Minister at Wash
ington, was appointed will soon expire,
and though Li Hung Chang, like the ex
perienced diplomat he is, made no prom
ises. He gave Wan On Bong a "letter
which he instructed him to carry to Wash
ington and present to Yang'Yu. The
Viceroy also wrote to Yang Yu telling
him to entertain Wav On Bone as a guest
at the Legation until he heard from the
Viceroy at Peking.

Annual Conference of the
Southern California
Pastors.
BISHOP FOSS PRESIDES.
Higher Mission of the Church
Explained in an Inspir
ing Address.
A FRIEND OF THE MASSES.
Its Field of Labor Among the Com
mon Peopleâ Opening Work
of tbe Session.
Los Ahgklks Office of The Call,)
328 South Broadway. V
Lob Angeles, Cal.. Sept. 23.)
The Southern California Methodist
Episcopal Conference began its public
work in Simpson Tabernacle here this
forenoon under the most favorable
auspices. Over 200 ministers of the church
were in attendance. The great tabernacle
was filled with people at the hour of open
ing. Bl3hop Cyrus D. Foss, D.D., LL.D.,
presided. Communion was administered
and at the close Bishop Foss addressed
the conference in an inspiring manner on
the work of the church in general.
Bishop Foss said that the Methodist
church was raised up to preach Scriptural
doctrines; to herald missionary zeal
throughout the world and to be a friend
of the masses of tbe people, especially in
this decade of strife between the wage
earner and the multi-millionaire. With
such resources as were at her hand she
faced the twentieth century with grander
prospects of triumph than ever before in
her history.
The Bishop first reviewed in a general
way the work done by the church since its
organization and dwelt on the good influ
ence which it had exerted. He pointed
out the necessity of following along those
lines. The power and influence which
had come to the church by reason of the
increase of members and the prestige of
previous deeds had increased the responsi
bility of the MethodiÃt church. The power
of the Methodist church did not lie so
much with the wealthy classes is with the
middle and poorer people. Unless the
mas=es were Christianized, the speaker
maintained, this Government could not
stand. Mob violence would prevail, and
it was to prevent this that the influence of
the church could be exerted to good and
practical ends in arbitration.
As an illustration he told how, through
the agency of himself, an Episcopal Bishop
and a Catholic Bishop, a streetcar strike
had been settled satistactorily in Phila
delphia. The mob had been growing more
violent, and at Jast the three churchmen
held a consultation with the owners of the
car lines and discussed with them their
responsibilities. The laDor leaders were
next called in, and after talking over the
situation with both interests the Bishops
drew up an agreement which che street
car owners and the labor representatives
signed, and thus the strike was brought to
a termination.
The officers of the conference were then
chosen as follows: Secretary, H. J. Crist;
assistant, E. J. Iawood; statistical secre
tary. J. M. Rich; assistants, N. J. Burton
A. M. Gibbon, H. W. Waltz :>nd A. H.
Guunett. The roll of the honored dead
was called and nominations for the various
committees made. A number of visiting
brethren were|greeted by Bishop Foss and
introdued to the conference. Among them
were: Robert Barton and D. R. Coliins of
Centralia. 111., S. L. Hamilton of Michigan,
C. R. Pattee of Kansas and J. if. Stine of
Minnesota.
Resolutions were passed indorsing the
Deaconesses' Home. The committee on
public worship reported Sunday afternoon
as the day for holding memorial services,
but after a general discussion it was
decided to include ordination services at
the meeting abo. Friday morning at 10
o'clock was selected as the time for dis
cussing constitutional issues. The princi
pal question which will come before this
session will be that of admitting women
as delegates to the general conference.
A statistical session was held in the
afternoon when the various pastors made
reports of the condition of their respective
churches as regards numbers and finances.
The wives of the various ministers attend
ing the conference also held a meeting at
3 o'clock at which a musical ana literary
programme was given.
A rally of all Epworthians in Southern
California will be held in Los Angeles
during the session. To-morrow is the day
selected for this gathering of young wai
riors. The convention will open at Ip. m.
in Simpson Tabernacle. An elaborate
programme by representative young peo
ple of Southern California has been pre
pared for the afternoon session. At 7:30
p. m. the anniversary of the league will be
celebrated in the auditorium of Simpson
Tabernacle. Bishop Foss will address the
assembly. Rev. Clarence True Wilson
will deliver his speech on "The Force of
Forces."

FIRED IN SELF - DEFENSE
Albert Kingsburu'* Story of thn Killing
of Rafael Grijalva.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 23.â The
culmination of the trial of Albert Kings
bury of Compton for the killing of Rafael
Grijalva last May was reached here this
morning, when the defendant gave his
version of the tragedy. Kingsbury said
that Grijalva came to the Van Ness ranch
on Thursday before the Sunday of the
shooting and called for him. Grijaiva ac
cused Kingsbury of talking about him.
Kingsbury replied that he had said noth
ing but what Grijalva stated before him in
the presence of two young men. Grijalva
called him a har, and took a pistol from
bis hip pocket and put it in his ri'ht
poclret. Urijalva told the defendant that
he had told Mrs. Van Ness he had
wronged her daughters.
On the Sunday of the killing Kingsbury
took two ladies who had been visiting
Mrs. \an Ness to the afternoon train at
Compton. Frankie Van Ness went with
him. As they were on the road borne. the
defendant saw Giijalva come from under
a willow tree along the road. Before they
reached him they saw a man nan.cd Joe
Machado, who is now missing, come along
leading a mare. As Kingsbury, in the
two- horse wagon, drew near, Grijalva
stepped in front of the horses and stopped
them.
Kingsbury asked Grijalva what he
wanted, and the latter said he wanted to
know why fCingsbury had not kept his ap
pointment to "go to Torris' saloon, as he
had agreed to. Kingsbury replied that he
did keep it. Grijalva exclaimed with an
oath tnat he was a liur, and put his right
hand back to his hip pocket, and Kings
bury saw the butt of a pistol. Grijalva put
bis left hand behind him and was trying
to disentangle his pistol. Kinzsbury felt
that Gnjalva was endeavoring to shoot,
him, and, drawing his pistol from the belt
with his left hand, fired one shot at
Grijalva and then drove on.
Kinssbury's testimony was given in a
straisrhtlorward manner, and could not be
shaken in cross-examination.

long time, has become a "bone of conten
tion 1 ' between her father, L. J. Selby, and
the Mitchells. The trouble resulted to
day in habeas corpus proceedings by Mr.
Selby to recover possession of his daugh
ter. Mr. Selby is Mrs. Mitchell's brother.
In his petition Mr. Selby states that in
1892 he was a widower, and bis mother
and daughter .lived with him. In 1893
they visited the Mitchells and his mother
died at their house. He then placed his
daughter in the care of Mr. and Mrs.
Mitchell, on the express understanding
that she should remain with them only
until he could properly care for her. For
nearly three years he has paid for her
board and lodging. Recently he married
again, and he is now able to take his little
daughter home.
He alleges that Mr. and Mrs, Mitchell
refuse to give the child to him and threaten
him with bodily violence if he tries to od
tain possession of her. It is for this rea
son, he states, that he applies to the court
for an order for possession of his daughter.
John W. Mitchell, tlie uncle of the
â¢child, is a well-known lawyer and leading
Democratic politician in Southern Calf
fornia.

I tain John R. Fletcher, who shot himself
I yesterday afternoon in an attempt to com
i mit suicide, died this morning. He was

KERN COUNTY SENSATION
Former Grand Jury Accused of
Having Defrauded the
People.
Alleged to Have Drawn Pay for Ser
vices When Not Actually in
Session-
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Sept. 23.â The
Grand Jury caused another sensation here
j to-day by demanding that the members of
the famous Long Grand Jury, which
: brought so many abortive indictments
j against county officials and others last
year, refund to the county the money
which it is alleged to have unlawfully
drawn for Sundays and holidays while
serving. In going over the records the
present Grand Jury found that the mem
bers of the former bod}' had charged the
county for services rendered on Sundays
and holidays when it was not actually in
session.
It is rumored that some action will be
taken in the case of Edjrar Moore, the al
leged expert upon whose testimony the
abortive indictments were found. He had
two assistants while be was experting the
county books and they drew $5 a day
apiece, but it is said they paid Moore $2 a
day each. Moore has refused to return
and testify in the cases where indictments
were brought upon his alleged discov
eries.
VISALIA TRIAL NEARING AN END.
Charles Ardell Denies the Charges Made
in the Confession of Silas
Lovren.
VISALIA, Cal., Sept. 23â Silas Lovren,
the convicted train-robbery plotter, stated
in a confession made by him on Sunday,
September 6, that Charleas Ardell, who is
now on trial, had given to Dan McCali, the
j outlaw killed at Tagus, certain guns, and
that Frank Davenport, now under arrest,
would bring out the other guns in time.
This morning Ardell went on the stand
and said that he had seen Lovren give the
weapons to McCali before the attempted
holdup at Tagus. Ardeli denied every al
legation that implicated him.
After David Butler was recalled the de
>fense rested its case and the closing argu
ment was commenced. F. B. Howard
opened for the prosecution and was fol
lowed by E. O. Miller for the defense. J.
W. Ahem and General Kittr-<ll will speak
to-morrow and M. E. Power will close.
E. O. Milier, the defendant's attorney,
made use of the following language in his
argument:
"They (the prosecution) have two able
attorneys with ill-gotten money in their
pockets, detectives supplementing the
Sheriff's office and a servile press bought
by railroad money demanding the defend
ant's blood."
FAILURE AT SAUSALITO.
Colonel Slinkey of Hotel El Monte
Heavily Involved.
BAN RAFAEL, Cal., Sept. 23.â Colonel
J. E. Slinkey, proprietor of El Monte
Hotel in Sausalito, filed in the Superior
Court at San Rafael to-day a petition in
insolvency. The schedule shows the
amounts of indebtedness to reach nearly
150,000. There is a list of 122 creditors,
the heaviest of whom are the Excelsior
Loan Association, $30,000, and Juuah Boas
of San Francisco $5000. Both are secured
by mortgages on the property. The indebt
edness to the other creditors varies from
$600 to $250 each. The assets above the
mortgages amount to about $4700.
Colonel Slinkey came to Sausalito in
the sixties. At that time he built El
Monte Hotel and the Sausalito Hotel, in
vesting about $90,000.
Improvements for Agnews Atylum.^
BAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 23.â A meeting
j of the board of trustees of Agnews Insane
I Asylum was held this morning for tbe
purpose of considering bids for the erec
tion of three cottages and two dormitories
on the asylum grounds. The plans had
not been approved oy the Governor, State
Treasurer and Secretary of Stai.e, and the
bids were returned unopened to the con
tractors. A joint meeting will shortly be
held at Sacramento by the trustees and
State officials, after which bids will be
called for. Contractors who were present
suggested the substitution of the use of
California redwood in \:lace of pine in the
construction of the buildings. This met
the board's approval, and the plans will
probably be thus changed. The three cot
tages are to cost $3000 each and the dormi
tories $4500 each.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept 23.â Gus Lion,

FOB VICF-PRRHI DENT-
GARRET A. HOBART, or New Jersey
EtFCTION XOTEMBEB 3. 1896.
To the Examiner even Presidential pol
itics is a freak.
By protection we flourish, but by free
trade we fall, and free silver wouldn't
save us.
"On to Canton" is still the cry of the
people. They know where the true
ieader is.
We must send to Congress men who will
not only rej resent our industries but vote
to protect them.
We have the best country and the best
people and must maintain the best wages
and the best money.
Sound money, sound business and
sound men are what the Republican party
offers to the country.
Anything for a new faks is the motto of
the Examiner, and Bryani6m is about as
good as a lottery scheme.
It is still a matter of doubt whether the
Democratic fusion bosses are playing Cator
for Senator or only for a sucker.
bo long as Bryan refuses to answer ques
tions about the tariff the people will have
to ask themselves what his silence means.
The Tammany braves thought Hill was
crawling into a hole and didn't know he
was digging a pit for them until they fell
into it.
Even Bryan himself has lost hope in his
election and has began to hedge by talk
ing of keeping up the fight in case of
defeat.
Bryan talks more and more about
nothing every day. His Philadelphia
BpÂ«pch was devoted largely to a talk about
his dignity.
Senator Hill drew it mild in saying
there is too much Populism in the Chicago
platform. As a matter of fact, there is too
much Altgeldism in it.
The Popocrats have had to give up the
attempt to make fun of Mark Hanna. He
has shown himself too big a man to be
hurt by their little ridicule.
Bryan Is not directly responsible for the
support given him by fake journals, but it
must be said there is something about
him which is attractive to them.
McKinley holJs his place in the center
of the country, while Bryan swings around
the circumference like a wandering satel
lite and shines Dy reflected radiance.
That the New York Democratic Btate
Convention has left a muddle behind it is
tbe best evidence possible that it was
truly representative of the party.
"He who tampers with the currency
robs labor of its bread," said Daniel Web
ster, and under Democratic conditions the
labor of America has no bread to lose.
Senator Thurston reports that in his
stumping tour he has found that the silver,
sentiment among the farmers is like
the milk sickness â always in some other
county.
The people of Europe who favor inter
national bimetallism will find an ally in
America, but those who hope to dupe
this country into going it alone will be
disappointed.
Senator Hill iB quoted as saying "The
common people do not understand the
currency question," but then the Senator
has always trained with the Democratic
machine and doesn't understand the
people.
While the Democrats have been hunt
ing Populists in the woods, the Republi
cans have taken complete possession of
the field of battle, and there isn't a single
point of vantage left for the fusionists to
occupy.
The popular vote In November will con
firm *he statement of McKinley â "The
people have no patience with those who
would violate the plighted faith of the
Nation and stamp its obligations with
dishonor."
The Examiner declares the change in its
I olicy on the silver question has not been
due to any recard for Hearst's mining
property, and it would seem therefore
that it surrendered to Aitgeld only be
cause it saw in his platform and his can
didate the crankiest freak and gayest fake
of the season.
"T:ie best of candidates for Supervisors
offered to the Democratic convention,"
!-:iicl tin- Examiner yesU-rday, "is enough to
discourage the voters of the party. If
this is the best that can be looked for it is
time that there was a new deal." There
will be one, of course, but the Examiner
will be disappointed. It won't be a freak
deal. r
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?
The Republicans of San Francisco
should consider seriously to-day wbo is
responsible for whatever of discord and
dissension exists in the local Republican
party. It is a shame and disgrace that,
on the eve of a Presidential election, when
great issues are at stake and the honor
and loyalty of California as a Republican
State is involved, that Republicans ol
San Francisco should be dragged into a
brawl over the party organization and
forced against their will to divide their
voting strength between two rival tickets
in tbe field.
Who is responsible for these divisions?
Who are the real traitors to tbe party ?
Who are to blame for defeat which dissen
sions may bring?
These are pertinent questions for every
Republican to ask and to have answered
fully and clearly to-day. Let the fects
turnish the answer. These are the facts:
The convention which assembled last
evening at the Auditorium and nominated
Hon. C. L. Taylor for Mayor of this City
is the only regular and legal representa
tive of the local Republican party. It de
rives its right to make nominations from
the regular County Central Committee of
tne party â a committee which was selected
in the usual and orderly way such com
mittees are constituted during the pre
vious campaign.
The right of that committee to repre
sent and act for the Republican party of
San Francisco during the past two years
has never been and cannot be dis
puted nor denied. It has never
been displaced or superseded by
any other political body possessing
any origin of right or title to aot for tbe
local Republican party. Its action and
its power to act for San Francisco were
formally confirmed by the Republican
State Convention which met in Sacra
mento last May.
By every party tradition and custom,
by unbroken descent of title, by every
principle of political self-government, the
Auditorium convention is the regular
Republic n convention, and each and
all of its nominees are entitled to
be recognized and received as the reeular
Republican party nominees of the City
and County of San Francisco.
For several days pust another body of
men have been attempting to meet and
have been assuming to call themselves a
"regular" Republican Convention of this
City. What is their right to this title?
What is the basis of their claim to recog
nition?
What is the foundation and superstruc
ture of their pretension that they are the
"Regulars," and that as such they have
the right to embro.l the party in the dis
cord and confusion of two political con
ventions?
There is absolutely no foundation to the
whole ridiculous pretense.
Conceding that the St. Louis National
Convention gave its recognition to the
contesting delegates from the Fourth
Congressional District for the purpose of
determining its own membership, its acts
and its power ended there.
By no possible stretch of authority could
a National committee or convention reach
into San Francisco, destroy its local po
litical organization and extend the powers
nf the claimants of regularity in a single
Congressional district over the whole City.
Such an act would have been subversive
of every right of local self-government
and of every principle and practice of
party politics.
The National Convention never did nor
intended to do this wrong, and yet upon
the flimsy and foolish claim of such
action the entire right and title of this so
called convention rests.
Upon this pretension also the one or
two men who are behind such shadow of a
convention have based their persistent
attempt to break into and break down the
reeular and legal organization of the Re
publican party of San Francisco.
In this attempt they have received
constant support and aid from a Demo
cratic newspaper, whose political wisdom
is limited to its effort to create division
and discord in the Republican party as a
means of Democratic success.
Who, then, is responsible for the exist
ing state of affairs in the local Republican
party? The men whose title to the party
organization is clear and indisputable, or
the men who have no title or right to call
or hold a convention and whose political
loyalty is illustrated and defined by their
desperate attempt to break into the party
organization, and failing in this to compel
it and its regular nominees to defeat?
Let the Republicans of San Francisco
consider to-day whom they will hold ac
countable for party dissensions and dis
cordâthose whom they selected and ac
credited as their regular and legal repre
sentatives, or those whom they have
never so selected. Whom will they believe
and supportâ Mr. John D. Bpreckels and
his associates or Martin Kelly and Jere
Mahoney? The choice Is with them.
We want a dollar that will lose none of its
vahie in our hands, a dollar that will be just
as good when we come to pay it out as uhen
we receive it. We want a dollar that can be
exchanged for any other dollar at -any time
or place that we may want to use it. Those
of us who are unfortunate enough to be pay
ing interest know that just as certainly as the
value of the dollar decreases so certainly the
rate of interest will increase. â N. B. Critch
field of Ohio.
CONCERNING WAGE-EARNERS.
The purchasing power of the wape
earners of this country is, of course, de
termined by the number of day's work
they have and the per day wages they re
ceive. When they have plenty of work at
good wages they are liberal buyers of
table commodities, for the American
workingmau is a good liver when he is
making money; but when be is
obliged to practice close economy
he can do it, and he has been
obliged to do it for a few years past.
But while we all know that certain of our
neighbors have been in enforced idleness
for nearly ttiree years, and consequently
have had to consume sparingly, it is doubf
ful if many have ever thought what a dif
ference in the total consumption of pro
visions the country over such idleness
makes.
In the one item of breadstuffs 65,000,000
people bought and consumed 800,000.000
more bushels of corn and about 69.000,000
more bushels of 'wheat in 1592 than 70,
-000,000 people did in 181*5. in 1892 prao
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1896.
tically every industry in the country was
running on full time, giving employment
at good wages to all who wanted employ
ment. In 1895 there were not many indus
tries in operation, ard consequently only
a few wage-people had opportunity to
earn wages. Of course all the other items
of consumption were cut down to the
lowest possible point, and everything that
approximated luxuries was given up en
tirely. But another item of vast import
ance which enters into the life
of tbe American workingman bad
to be given up, very much to his
physical hurt ami mental distress.
We refer to the days and evenings set
apart for recreation. He had to forego all
pleasure tl at cost incuey, for he could
not afford to have Eiore than the com
monest necessities. Such has been and is
still the fruit of the Wilson-Gorman tariff
act which working-people gather.
It would be a reflection on the intelli
gence of the working class to say that they
do not know all about these things, but it
would be a reflection on their reputation
for being -industrious, frugal and willing
workers to say they ere so indifferent that
they will not take aa active part in the
work now in hand to reopen mill and fac
tory bo that they may again have all
needed opportunity to earn good wages
and consequently be able to live as be
comes an American mechanic or laborer.
It is rot human nature to want such con
ditions of existence an the AVilsoii-Gorman
tariff has caused and workingmen will not
vote to continue them.
I recommend the. election of Major McKin
ley most stromjly, beeavse I believe in v hat
is praised as "the vionty of the constitution."
I want to see the triunph of "the dollar of
our futhers." But J uould say that when a
man comes to vie with <*nly 50 cents' worth
of silver duly stamp i and profanely in
scribed "/u God We Trust, v and asks me to
take it and palm it ojT on romelody else as
the "dollar of our dadditM," to be received
by that somebody else fir a dollar's worth of
something I want that he has â / say that I
decline to join in the svinale, and I proclaim
this to him: "iiir, my daddies and the daddies
of this Nation were, not that kind of men. 17 â
liev. F. W. Gunsauhts.
THE NEXT MAYOR.
The Republican County Convention be
gan its work well when it placed at the
head of its ticket for the responsible
position of Mayor of San Franci-co a gen
tleman so well and favorably known, not
only to the people of this City, but to the
people of the State as well.
C. L. TayJor is not an experiment in the
field of government. He haÂ» been tried
and found true. He is a pioneer resident
of this City and his public and private life
has been open to inspection for nearly a
generation. In business circles he Is
among the most prominent, and the
breath of reproach has never dimmed the
luster of his integrity.
This is the type of men of which good
officials are made. A man who has been
successful in his own business is tbe kind
of officer that tbe people want to suter
vi-e their affairs. A - a Supervisor Mr.
Taylor built up a record for un-werving
fidelity to the interests of his constituents
which any official niicht well envy.
The public have not iorgotten the solid
four who stood out manfully for right and
justice, and contested inch by inch the in
cursions of the execrated eight, who will
be soon relegated to the oblivion which
they have earned so well.
Mr. Taylor, in his ofiicial capacity, has
done and ha 3 helped to do many things
for the benefit of the people. They are
fresh in memory, and it is not necessary
to particularize them here. That the
tax levy* has been held within the
limits suggested by taxpayers is
due in no small measure to his efforts.
His experience in the chair, presiding
over the Board of Supsrvi-ors during the
nb-enceof Mayor Sutio, added to his ex
perience as a Supervisor, will be of much
value to him in the future.
He stands prominently forward as a
representative of that clement which is
most deeply interested in securing for it
self a capable and honest government.
He is also a representative Republican
and a citizen whom ev^ery voter may in
dorse with a feeling of confidence and se
curity.
The country is cursed with political as well
as financial heresy, certain phases of which
are entirely new, foreign to our soil and alto
gether un-American. They spring from and
are directly imported from the hotbeds of
European socialism. Let no one imagine
this statement an exaggeration. Examine
the socialist programmes, as they are called,
of Europe; their advocacu of repudiation of
debt, the nationalization of industries, pro
gressive income taxes, the fomenting of
alleged class animosities, the referendum,
their disregard of the validity of contracts, of
legislative acts, of legal forms and prin
ciples. You will find their counterparts in
Populist utterances and in the Chicago and
St. Louis Populistic platform*.â Perry Bel
mont.
TAMMANY AND HILL.
Tammany in particular, and the Demo
cracy of the country in general, now know
what Senator Hill meant when be said to
the Chicago convention : "I am a Demo
crat, but lam not a revolutionist." Ad
dressing himself to Tammany, but intend
ing that the whole country should hear
him, be said: "I would see the Demo
cratic party in first before I would in
dorse some parts of the Chicago platform."
The occasion was a meeting of Tammany
to force John B. Thacher, the party's
nominee for Governor of New York, off
the ticket because he is not a Bryan man,
and Hill was there not only to insist
that Tna cber remain at the head of the
ticket, but to read tbe riot act to the
party.
There does not seem to be any doubt
that the Buffalo convention, which was
packed with delegates 01 the Bryan wing,
was inveigled into a trap by Hill and that
it did not realize its predicament until it
had nominated a very pronounced anti-
Bryan man for Governor. Tammany, or
rather a few of the bOÃPet> who happened
to have control of the organization, under
took to revamp the party of the State upon
Bryan lines, and had tha scheme worked
S nator Hill and ail the other old leaders
of the party wouid have been carted off to
Tammany's burying-ground, but the
scheme did not work.
The upshot of the rupture will be that
Tbacher will not withdraw, the anti-
Bryan Democrats will not put up a ticket
and the State will cive McKinley more
than 100,000 majority, with possibly a
Democratic .Legislature. At this distance
that appears to be Hill's programme.
But anyway it is very evident that the
Hill following do not intend to let Bryan
carry the State, and to that extent at least
the country is better off for having Hill
live in it. It is a little curious that the
Tammany following which Hill is fight
ing is the same crowd that fought Cleve
land in 1892, and it ia also interesting to
note that Hill was then their leader,
which puts him in a position where he has
to acknowledee that Cleveland knew Tam
many in 1892 better than Hill did, and it
puts Hill in exactly tiie same position
with reference to the party that Cleveland
occupied four years ago â and Cleveland
won.

Katherine Klafsky, who died at Hamburg on
Tuesday, will be a great loss to Wagnerian
opera. There are few prima donnas who
could surpass her in certain Wagnerian roles
since Materna retired from the operatic stage.
Klafsky owed more to her superb natural
voice and her fine stage presence than to her
vocal training, thougn she was a pupil of the
far-famed Mme. Marches!. Last winter when
she sang in New York with Walter Damrosch's
opera company the critics were loud in their
lamentations that such a "gorgeous" voice
should be so indifferently used. Brunhilde
was one of Klafsky's favorite pans, but
though she was not so large as Materna she
was gaining In weight and gave an impression
of bulk which Materna never conveyed as the
warrior goddess. She was still a compara
tively young woman, being three days past
her_ forty-first birthday at the- time of her
death. She began her career at the age of 20,
but on ncr first marriage retired from the
stage, and subsequently began her career all

tors hayÂ« filled the palace of fine arts with
their works and its musicians have shown
their compositions in a symphonic concert,
which took place last Saturday in Victoria
IiÂ»:i, a magnificent new building, the like of
which is not to be found in Paris. To tell the
truth, I rather distrusted going to that con
cert. I did not know whether serious conser
vatories and choral societies existed in the
country, and without exactly limiting Swiss
music to the 'Kanz uea Vacbes' I did not be
lieve in it. 1 wes wrong, and 1 hasten to make
amend*. There are musicians in Switzerland
âgood musicians â and the courageous little
country will have Its part in the modern musi
cal movement. There is Edouard Combe,
born in 1866. His 'Adagio Symr honique' is a
beautiful inspiration, and I should not be
astonished il a great future were reserved for
him. Jacques Dalcroxe is certainly the
most original and expert of the Swiss com
posers. His overture to 'Sancho,' an opera
which he holds in reserve for the Geneva
Theater, is, I believe, a wonderfuly ingenious
work." Among the other Swiss composers
mentioned by Carre are Frederic Hegltr, di
rector of the Zurich Conservatory, and Gus
tave Doret, who promises to hare a brilliant
future.
A perfect craze for musical comedies seems
to have broken out in the British capital, and
as New York often follows London's lead In
matters theatrical the epidemic will no doubt
spread to America. Indeed, "The Geisha" has
already tern transported by Daly from the
Gaiety Theater and has been mounted at
Hoyt's regardless of expense. The matter is
becoming serious in London, for before tho
end of next month half the theaters in the
city will be playing musical comedies, and the
cry is still they come! All sorts of subjects
are being travestied by these musical farce
I composers, who pay Gilbert and Sullivan the
I sincerest form of flattery, though their imlta
j tions are not up to the originals. The "Geisha
Girl" is Japanese and deals with tourists and
i dancers. May Yohe is going to produce an
t Egyptlan musical comedy, "The Belle of
Cairo," and "Monte Cario" is an operetta that
treats Europe's greatest gambling resort in a
light and airy vein. No subject is sacred from
the travesty-maker and the latest announce
ment is that the Armenian subject is to be
turned into a musical comedy. This operetta
will be called "The Piccadilly Pasha."
Among the most Interested listeners at the
last series 6f performances at Bayreuth were
Jean and Edouard de Reszke, who no doubt
went to the fountain head for inspiration for
the roles of Wctan and Siegfried, which they
are respectively engaged by Grau to. sing in
London next season. Jean de Reszke is to marry
his countess next month, and he would much
prefer to retire permanently from the stage
after his wedding, but Grau is a warm personal
friend of his, so to oblige him Jean will sing
for Abbey, Bchoeffel & Grau this season in
America, and will also lend his help to Grau
for the London season of '97. At the end of
next year Jean de Rcszke says he will forever
sever his connection with the theater, as he
wishes to retire to his estate in Poland and
live the life of a wealthy country gentleman.
One of the outcomes ot the recent Wagnerian
performances at Bayreuth is a dispute between
the critics as 10 the spelling of certain proper
names in Wagner's operas. Should it be
Slenmound, or Biegmund7 Nibeloung, or
Niebetung? Of course, the answer to this is
that the spelling of legendary names in a
foreign literature cannot be fixed by any defi
nite rules. Each translator has the right of
spelling in the way that seems best to his
point of view. For instance, It is now granted
that one can now write indifferently Parsifal,
or Perceval; Walkyrie, or Valkyrie.
A spirited new marcn has just been pub
lished by Major C. Hunt entitled "The
Pride of the Navy." The new work, which is
dedicated to Irving M. Scott, has a good swing-
Ing melodious retrain which should make it
as popular as any of the Sousa marches. "The
Pride of the Navy" has already bten played by
tbe Park baud more than once, and on each
occasion was very heartily applauded. Major
C. Hunt is a Native Son, and his decided tal
eut in the way of march composing should
bring him rapidly to the front.
The first Bacon-Miuetti matinee will take

A monster organ has just been inaugurated
in Sydney, the construction of which was com
menced in 1893. According to the papers it
has five keyboards and several miles of pipes.
Its sonority is remarkable; as great, indeed, as
the price, and that is over a hundred thousand
dollars. The day of its inauguration the
maker gave a banquet which was served in
the interior of the instrument. Â»
"It is not without lively satisfaction." says
L'Eco Musical, "that we see the normal Ditch
making progress in England. At the annual
concert Just given by the Royal Academy of
Music, the French pitch was used for the first
time in the history of the institution."
The indefatigable Mme. Cosima Wagner has
discovered a new tenor in the person of a
j blacksmith's apprentice, named Charles Kein'
j lechner. He is to be placed in the musical and
dramatic school of Bayreuth, wl.ich has
already produced so ninny remarkable artists.
The Swedish composer, Ivar Hallstroem,

"L'Enfant Prodlgue," was such a success in
Europe and the East, has just writteu a new

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
IN POOR CONDITION.
A Portion op Folsom Street That Needs
ATTENTION.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Call -Sir:
I wish to respectfully call the attention of the
authorities through the columns of your paper
to the condition of Folsom street between
Fourth and Sixth. Those who have the con
tract to bituminize the two blocks have re
moved all the basalt blocks on botn sides, ex
cept the entrance to stables, etc., which leaves
tliK street in a very bad condition and detri
mental to any 0113 living or doing business
withm above named blocks.
Winter Is fast approaching and there is no
sign of the contractor resuming the work, Con
sequently it seems quite possible that the
street will be left in the same condition as it
wtis two years agoâ simply impassable.

A JACKET COSTUME FOR GIRLS.
Jacket effects are always extremely becom

unusually graceful cut. The full under front
is becoming alike u> stout or very slender fig
ures. A stylish addition is the "narrow belt,
which may be of leather, gilt braid or ribbon.
The skirt is simply gathered into the band, a
five-inch band of hair cloth or some stiff inter-
lining being set on the bottom to give the
proper flare. Wash-dresses are simply hemmed
at the foot and worn over very full petticoats.
A dress of cadet blue had a full vest of blue

were likewise of the silk, with green spangles

rows of green braid. A dress of dark-blue
novelty goods had a vest of batiste, cross
barred with stripes of many blight colors. The
sailor collar was ot the same fabric, the revers
being of the mohair.
All woolen roods makeup beautifully after
this model. One of a blue and white broken

Tunnelâ N. S. M., East Oakland, Cal. There
is a tuunel under the St. Clair River between
Port Huron, St. Clair County, Mich., and
Sarnia, Canada. This tunnel was built to con
nect the tracks of the Grand Trunk Railroad
of Canada with the Chicago and Grand Trunk,
the Detrcit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee and
the Toledo, Saginaw and Muskegon railroads
in the United States. The tunnel was built of
cast-iron segments by means of hydraulic
shields, and was the first cast iron tunnel of
its kind and tne longest river tunnel in tho
worldâ 6oso feet. It was begun in August,
1889, and was Duilt at the rate of 159 feet per
week, the two shields meeting in the center
August 30, 1890. The iirst railroad trip was
made through it April 9. 1891, and it was
formally opened on the 19th of the following
September. The outside diameter is 21.7 and
the inside 20 feet. The cost of constructing
this tunnel was within tho estimate ot
$3,000,00. In 1871 it was proposed to con
struct a tunnel under the Detroit River to con
nect the City of Detroit with tne Canadian
ride, for use ot the Michigan Central and the
Great Western Railway of Canada. A small
drainage tunnel was driven as an experiment
to a distance of 1240 feet from the Michigan
side and more than 370 feet from the Canadian
shore. Great difficulties were encountered
from the inflow of water and gas, the former
under a head much greater than that due to
the depth of the river. The cost far exceeded
the expectations. Rnd the work was finally
abandoned in 1873.

make time. Tramp steamers have cume
here from all parts ot the world, and me
cry is "still they come." Puget Sound,
Central America and the Orient have
thrown their disengaged tonnage on Cali
fornia, but the demand has been so great
that vessels are now eagerly sought for by
the grain merchants. Nearly 100,000 tons
of wheat and oarley have left here during
the past month, but the supply is uu
diminished and every vessel in port and
those on the way can be loaded.
Yesterday tbe Merchants' Exchange
marine reporter had a busy time of it at
the Heads. Three ships and a steamer, all
grain laden, went out and several vessels
were coming in at the same time. The
tugs which towed the grain ships to sea
made for borne as soon as the work was
done, and in consequence visitors to the
Cliff House saw the prettiest scene viewed
from Point Lobos this year.
Among the departures was tbe British
ship Star of France with 51,245 centals of
barley, valued at $40,500; the Britiab ship
Formosa with 43,662 centals of bariey and
&*3l centals ot wheat, valued at $45,000;
the Norwegian steamer Aggi with &5,i7U
centals of barley and 50,579 centals of
wheat, valued at $75,380, and the Helens
burgh with a wheat cargo valued at over
$45,000. Tbe John Cookts is to sail to-day,
to the race home is sure to be a lively one.
Tbe betting on the race is brisk, favoring
the Star ot France. Captain Wyatt says
he will beat the record "il I only get fair
winds." The ship in question is a smart
vessel and me chances are that she will
show the others her heel?.
Cauiain Cooper of tbe British ship Royal

and his wife boarded the car at the
Kearny-street junction and took the front
seat on tbe dummy. He was dressed like
an Englishman ami bad the accent of bis
mother country in bis speech. Captain
Meredith happened to be on tbe same car,
and just bebind the couple. Getting as
near to the Yankee twain; as a Welshman
possibly can, he remarked, "Strangers
welcome to San Francisco." Cooper
stopped the car and was demanding an
explanation, when be recognized bis life

not tate Captain Cooper's anger long to
turn into joy as soon as be recognized his

The four-masted British ship Bermuda
got in from Puget Suund in ballast yester
day. Sue will load wheat for Europe, and
will get quick dispatch. She is an English
whaieback and tbe first of her kind that
has ever come to San Francisco. She has
no bulwarks, but shipping men say the

WHARTON IS WORSTED.
The Supreme Court Will Not Remove
the Judgment "Whereby He la
Disbarred.
Z. F. Wharton, a Sacramento attorney
recently disbarred by the Superior Court
of Sacramento County, appealed to the
Supreme Court for redress yesterday.
Justice Garoutte rendered a decision
affirming the judgment of the Capital
City tribunal, Justices Harrison, Hen
shaw. McFarlana and Temple concurring.
The main charges against Wharton are
that in the divorce case of Hoxie against
Hoxie he filed a fraudulent affidavit, and
did the same in hi 9 own application for a
divorce from his wife. The affidavits in
bot â¢ cases were signed by one Peter
Stortz, who was led to believe that he was
signing a receipt in the former instance
and a will in the latter. Wuarton's con

CALIFORNIA FRUITS.
In Great Demand in Several European
Countries.
J. A. Filcher, manager of the State
Board of Trade, has been informed tbat a
general horticultural expositionâ one of
the most extensive in modern history â
will be held in Hamburg, Germany, from
May to September of next year. H;s cor
respondents, who are representative Ger
mans of tbis City, earnestly advise that
the Btate Board of Trade make special
efforts to send a fine exhibit to the Ger
man exposition.
They claim that an exhibit of what this
State can produce in tbe dried and pre
served fruit line would be the means of
creating a demand for California products
in Germany. The matter will be consid
ered at the cext meeting of the board.
The secretary of the California Wine
Association also writes to Mr. Fiicher
stating tbat Pietro Righi of Bologna,
Italy, has written to the association, and
says that in Genoa there is a great de
mand for California prunes shipped in
bags. Mr. Filciier will place the matter
before local dealers with the view of send

Italy's demand for prunes.

The Charge of Perjury Against Dr. A.

The case against Dr. A. A. Cunningham,
ex-secretary of the Veterinary Department
of the State University, charged with per
jury, was dismissed by Judge Joachimsen
yesterday, as the complaining witness,
Justice of the Pease Carroll, failed to ap
pear. , i
â¢ The charge arose out of a statement made
on an affidavit by Dr. .Cunningham for a
change of venue in regard to the hearing
of a charge of misdemeanor-embezzlement
against him. : Justice of the Peace Carroll
was at the time presiding in Judge Con
lan's court, ; and in the affidavit it was
stated that he belonged to the same order

It is understood that the charge was
based on misinformation and Justice Car
roll is stated to have made the amende
honorable' to Dr. Cunningham, by apolo
gizing for having, through a misunder
standing, put him to any trouble in the
matter. Tbis action entirely exonerates
the doctor.

FIVE BISHOPS
WILL CONVENE
An Episcopal Conference to
Be Held Here Next
Week.
BISHOP NICHOLS* IDEA.
They Will Come From Olympia,
Utah, New Mexico and
Los Angeles.
ALL TO PREACH ON SUNDAY.
The Bishops Have a Programme
Before Them That Will Last
the Entire Week.
Episcopalians will have a plethora of
riches next Sunday in the matter of
preachers, for five local pulpits will be
occupied simultaneously by as many bish
ops, all of whom have claims to eloquence.
It is said to have been Bishop Nichols'
idea to assemble together some of the
leading Western bishops in a sort of in-
Bishop Barker of the Diocese of
Olympia.
formal bishops' convention. It has been
his wish for some time to meet his breth
ren on the bench and talk over the inter
ests of Episcopalianism In the West. He
also wis: ed to see all the Western bishops
become trustees of the Divinity School at
San Mateo, for, though the school was
founded primarily for this diocese, it also
aims at taking students from all the West
ern section of the country.
Four bishops were able to respond to
Bishop Nichols' desire, and they are ex
pected here on Saturda3\ They are:
Bishop Barker of Oiympia, Western Wash
ington, Bishop Kendrick of Arizona and
New Mexico, Bishop Johnson of Los An
geles and Bishop Leonard of Utah Ne
vada and Western Colorado. The Ri<*ht
Rev. William Morris Barker, D.D.. suc
ceeded Bishop Paddock aa Bishop of Olym
pia. He is a man about 40 years of age
and ij said to be full of energy and enter
prise. He is what might be called a broad
churchman, a man of liberal education,
who has traveled much and read much!
and he is said to be an excellent business
director. Bishop Barker has the open
sincere manner peculiar to people familiar
with Western Hie, and is as easily ap
proached as the humblest curate in his
diocese.
Bishop Kendrick has been several years
in Ni'W Mexico and Arizona, of which he
is the third missionary Bishop. He is a
man of great energy, and is said to be a
1 line speaker. One feature of bis work nas
been the way in which he has taken the
Reformed Church of old Mexico into his
jurisdiction. He has made several pas
toral visits across the frontier, and has
held confirmations and ordained deacons
in the sister republic. Bishop Kendrick is
a native of Ohio.
Bishop Leonard succeeded Bishop Tut
tle as Missionary Bishop of Utah. Bishop
Johnson of Los An-eles is well known in
this City, as he was here during the re
cent Episcopal convention. The fifth
Bishop who will occupy a local pulpit will
be Bishop Nichols himself.
Ah interesting programme has been ar
ranged to occupy the entire week during
the bishops' stay. On Sunday tbey will
preach morning and evening. Bishop
Barker wiil occupy the pulpit of St. John's
in the morning and will be heard, at St.
Paul's in the evening. Bishop Kendrick
will give the morning to the Church of
the Advent and tbe evening to St. Steph
en's. Bishop Johnson will be heard at
Trinity in the morning and St. Luke's
Church at nitrht, and Bishop Leonard will
preach at Grace Churcn iv the morning
and St. Peter's at night.
On Monday Bishop Nichols and the
four visiting bishops will attend tbe meet
ing of the clericus aud in tbe afternoon
the Episcopalian clergy of this City who
compose the clericus will tender a dinner
at the Occidental to the visiting bishops.
On Tuesday evenina the Brotherhood of
St. Andrew and the Daughters of the
King will meet in tbe Church of the Ad
vent and there will be addresses by all the
bishops. On Wednesday the bishops will
visit the chnrch institutions of the diocese,
the Maria Kip Orphanage, the Sheltering
Arras, etc., and will lunch at Trinity
School. Thursday and Friday will be de
voted to visiting Bishoft Nichols and the
Divinity School at San Mateo, but on Fri
day evening there will be a grand mission
ary meeting at St. Luite's Church, at
which ail tbe bishops will speak. Satur
day will be devoted to a basket picnic to
Tamolpais and on Sunday all the bishops
will preuch again.
During his stay in this City Bishop
Barker will stay with his brother-in-law,
Colonel Mendell. Bishop Leonard will be
the guest ol James Brown of tbe Bank of
California.
Held for Perjury.
Meyer Livingston was yesterday held to
answer before the Superior Court by Judge
Low la $1000 bonds on the charge of perjury.
He was a member of the insolvent firm of
Livingston Brothers, Junk dealer?, and during
his examination in the Superior Court swore
that a bag containing $5000 had been stolen
from his house, which forced the firm into
insolvency.

HAS HE KEPT HIS CONTRACT?
The Superior Court Is Asked to De
cide as to the Young Man's
Conduct
The Superior Court, in a complaint filed
by Charles F. Crocker and William H.
Crocker, has been asked to declare if George
Crocker has been strictly sober for five
years. If he has been he is entitled to a
princely fortune. The plaintiffs, who are
trustees of a fund amounting to over a
half million dollars, ask that the Superior
Court terminate their stewardship.
The trust is a peculiar one, and was
created by Charles Crocker, the father of
Charles F., William H. and George
Crocker, April 22, 1887. By terms of
an agreement made that day the property
was to be held in trust for George Crocker
for fifteen years. If during that time he
should remain Bober for a period of five
years it must be paid to him.
If George Crocker died within the time
named, without having received the heri
tage, or if he failed to remain sober for the
required period, the trust fund was to
have been distributed between the chil

dren of Charles F. and William H. Crocket
and Harriet V. Alexander.
Charles Crocker died August 14, 1883,
and failed to make any provision for hia
son George in his will. The trust prop
erty, which consists of 490 bonds of the
Southern Pacific Branch Railway Company,
has been under the absolute control of the
trustees ever since.
George Crocker did not feel equal to the
task of winning his fortune until Septem
ber 22, 1891. On that day he abjured the
pleasures of the flowing bowl and has since
been sober. The period of proba
tion was up day before yesterday, and
George Crocker at once served notice that
he would like to have his half million.
The trustees are not only willing but
anxious to comply with this demand, but
are afraid to take the responsibility of
deciding that the beneficiary is entitled to
the property. They say in the complaint
filed that the minors, who would recieve
the money in the event of George
Crocker's failure to do so, may have some
reason to question the statement as to his
recent sobriety, and hence ask the court
to determine whether or not he la en
titled to the money.

STOCKTON'S TRACK
Speedy Horses Compete in
Three Exciting
Events.
SLEEPY LOUPE AWAKENS
Phenomenal Time Made by the
Golden Gate Fark
Roadster.
TOO FAST FOR DEL NORTE.
Drivers McManus and Cecil Fined by
the Judgesâ Fanny C Shows
Class.
STOCKTON. Cal., Sept. 23.â With beau
tiful weather, a splendid card of trotting
and pacing events, and a free gate for the
fair sex, the officials of the track looked
for a big attendance to-day, yet it must
nave been with a feeling of disappoint
ment that they cast their syes upon the
meager crowd in the big grand stand, that
in the years gone by re-echoed with the
cheers of thousands of excited spectators.
Can it be that harness sport is on the
decline? It must be so. The betting, as
well as the betting ring itself, showed a
marked improvement, the pool sellers
enjoying a most enervating day's business.
In the lower grand stand, a couple of
wagon loads of the more pacific-minded of
the unfortunate human beings from the
State Insane Asylum gazed upon the
finishes, with at times a gleam of intelli
gence lighting up their stolid countenan
ces.
Of the sport itself, nothing bat praise
can be said. Fanny C, owned by the well
known Sacramento merchant, Hugh
Casey, made her field look very ordinary
in the 2:40 trot, much to her owner's
delight. She was driven by Charley
JeSeries, who thus successfully signalized
his first appearance before a California
racegoing public, and created a very
favorable impression.
Conn was finally cut loose and captured
the best part of the heat dash es for horses
of the 2:19 class. The 2:13 pace remained
unfinished as the sun sank below the
level of distant hills. And what an over
throw it promises to bel Del Norte, the
statuesque son of Altamont, buried in the
dust kicked up by the neels of the sleepy
looking Loupe, which all winter long
posed as an ordinary roadster in Golden
Gate fark, San Francisco, hauling his
owner out to the beach and sniffing the
invigorating sea breeze with such delight
ful results that he to-day stepped a mile
of the third heat in 2:lo>i and this in
such hurricane fashion as to indicate that
2:oB}Â£ might not be beneath his level. The
first heat, won by Del Norte and in which
Loupe barely got within the distance flag,
was expensive for Driver McManus, who
was rightfully fined $100 for his wiseness.
Another driver, W. Cecil, took things
easy in the 2:40 trot with Peter Jackson
and he stands charged up with $50.
Pity it is the strict rules of the running
turf are not in effect on the trotting and
pcaing turf. The iatter is gradually drift
ing to ruin through the machinations of a
clique of "wise drivers," who have grown
rich and again poor at the expense of a
disgusted puolic which now seeks relief
by staying away.
With but three very ordinary ones op
posing her, Fanny C sold a $20 to $4 favor
ite over the tield, and won in three straight
heats, with Peter Jackson taking second
nioney. The mare will hereafter appear
in the colors of Mr. Wins Dip.
The 2:19 trot, heat dashes, was a rather
contused affair. Before the first heat, clos
ing pools were: Field $10, Nettie Ham $9
and Neernut $4. Conn took the first two
heats off the reel, and that after making a
bad break in the second heat. He took a
mark of 2 :15^ in the first heat. A break
cost him the third heat, won by Eva T,
and under the conditions of the race he
as well as the mare went to the stable.
For the consolation heat, Neernut was
favorite over the field. He failed to get a
slice of the coin. Columbus S won the
heat, but was placed second and the heat
given to Clay S, greatly to the crowd's
satisfaction.
The betting on the 2:13 pace showed a
greatly agitated market, the pooling being
about the liveliest of the entire circuit.
Del Norte brought $40, Loupe $22, Hazel
HsB and the field $11. Del Norte took the
first heat after a bruising finish with Hazel
H, in the fast time of 2:lo>^, which is now
the black horse's mark ; the crowd cheered.
The heat winner then sold a $10 to $6
favorite over the field for the second heat,
with a few short-end purchasers. Loupe
challenged his brother back in the stretch
and made him look like a "yaller dore,"
winning easily in 2:11 J^. Now Loupe sold
82to 1 choice over the field. He marched
around Del Norte in the stretch and
finished like a cyclone in 2:lo}^, with Bill
Frazier second. In this heat the hand
some mare Lena N created a sensation by
flying past the field in ghostly fashion the
first quarter and giving promise of mak
ing the two-minute record. She made a
break midway down the backstretch,
which threw her put of â [ the heat. The
race was postponed on account of dark
ness until 1 o'clock to-morrow. .

FOOTBALL AT STANFORD.
Fine Showing Made by the Men in a
Practice Game.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
23.â The playing of the football men to
day was admirable, considering how early
it is in the season. There was quite a per
ceptible amount of interference and the
team? worked together better than in the
previous games. Cross waded around in
the muddy clay after the players, and no
good play missed his commendation or no
poor play missed his reproof. His whole
heart was evidently in the game, and he
had the men equally interested. The
grounds were in miserable shape, being
water-soaked and slippery.
Dole '98 and Fisher '98, at halfback po
sitions, showed up well. Dole has a good
"straight arm," which helps him greatly
in his runs, and he is fast proving a first
class man back of the line. Fisher's
strong point is in bucking. He hits the
line with great force and is a hard man to
throw off his feet. Williams, at center of
tbe Varsity, played a good game, and B.
Thomas '97 and Lanegan '90, both at halfs,
showed that they had football blood in
them.
Among those who have thus far shown
the greatest ability as ends are McGilvray
'00 and Madden '00. They are speedy
men at getting under punted balls, and
each of them had several excellent tackles
to his record yesterday.
So evenly were the first and second elev
ens divided that neither showed much su
periority over the other. Inasmuch as
there still remain two weeks and more for
practice before the first match game of the
season Stanford, from present outlook,
should have a much better team afield
than ever before at so early a date in the
football season.

Day's Winners.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., Sept. 23.â The
attendance, at the fair grounds at Glen
brook Park to-day was much larger than
yesterday, owing partly to the more favor
able condition of the weather and partly
to the fact that the people are beginning

A GIRL'S FOOLISH ACT
Mildred A. Clark Took Lauda
num in a Market-Street
Lodging-House.
She Said Seme One Told Her to Go
to the Devil, and She
Tried to Do So.
She was told to go to the devil. That
was all that caused Miss Mildred A. Clark
to swallow a bottleful of laudanum, so
she says, and but for timely assistance the
girl would now' have been dead.
She is young, handsome, is a talented
vocalist, and lived in a good home at 2218
Webster street.
Early yesterday afternoon Mlbs Clark
went to the Mascot lodging-house at 1118
Market street and hired a room, of which
she immediately took possession.
Late last evening some noise attracted
Ed M. Sim, one of the runners for the
nouse, to enter the room, and he found
her lying on a sofa unconscious.
At once the girl was aroused, and was
walked up and down the floor to keep the
eflects of the laudanum from overcoming
her, and then, when she was in a con
dition to remain still for awhile, she was
sent to the Receiving Hospital.
At the'hospitai the girl said some one â
she would not say who â had told her to
go to the devil, and. as she was tired of
life, she thought she would do so.
She wanted Dr. Hubbell of 2339 Pine
street sent for, as sl.e said he was the fam
ily physician, but he refused to come and
said to send for her mother. This was
done.
s, In her pockets were found a bottle
which had contained the laudanum,
labeled Bowman & Sons, Oakland; also a
card with the inscription "Miss Mildred
A. Clark, mezzo soprano."
She seemed well acquainted in musical
circles.
Her folks were surprised when they
learned she was at the hospital, but be
yond saying her mother would be down
later they would not speak of the case.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1896.
AROUND THE WORLD
ON A BICYCLE
A One-Legged Rider Is
Pedaling His Weary-
Way.
TRAVELED 2878 MILES.
He Left Madison, South Dakota,
on June i, and Went as
He Pleased.
FLEP FROM "HARD TIMES."
Now His Possessions Are Reduced to
a Single Cent, Some Old C othes
and His Trusty Wheel.
R. W. Brown, who left Madison, South
Dakota, on June 1 to ride a bicycle around
the world, reached this City yesterday
afternoon, weary, battered, bruised and
hungry.
Brown is not trying to matte any par-
ticular record. All he wants is a change
of scenery and especially to get away, as
be says, from "the hard times in South
Dakota."
He has been pushing westward only
one-third of the three months and twenty
three days he has been away from Madi
son, and has made many pleasant stops
along the road.
At Ogden he rested for four days and he
spent two pleasant weeks in Salt Lake
and eight days at Sacramento, without
counting brief stops at minor points along
the road.
"In all," stated the cyclist, "I have
traveled, according to my cyclometer, a
distance of 2878 miles, less two rods."
Presumably R. W. Brown would have
traveled that distance in half the time had
he started out without a serious handicap.
As it is, he has but one leg, a lett one at
that, the other having been amputated
some eight years ago.
"1 was born forty-two years ago in the
Vermont Green Mountains and have been
a farmer, harness-maker and a carpenter
up to the time I found I couldn't make a
living in the East. I had my wheel and
exactly 34 cents when I started out, leav
ing behind me no relatives nor pleasant
recollections and having the world before
me to traverse at my leisure, making my
living as best I could, either riding exhi
bitions or working at mv trades. That is
all there is about me. I'm here now with
exactly a sum total of 1 cent as my capital
and I'm hungry, need a bath and some
clean clothes, and I'm positive I'll have
all this before many hours. At all events
I'd just as soon starve in this country as I
would dry up and blow away in Madison."
The agent for the cycle on which Brown
rode across the continent was soon with
him and it is not likely he will remain
long in want.
"The centpiece I still possess," said
Brown, "is an English coin, with the
stamp of Queen Victoria on it. I propose
presenting her with it when I reach Eng
land.
"It took me thirty-one days to get to
Ogden. At Deny r I rode and" won a race,
for which I received $5.
"I left Ogden Wednesday, the 27th of
August. At Orand Junction I was pre
sented with an $8 parse for giving an exhi
bition.
"I must not forget the professional race
in which 1 rode at Salt Lake. There were
thirty entries and twenty- one starters. I
was allowed a seven-minute handicap
over the scratch man and I came out
eighth in a ten-mile race,
"The best time I made on the entire trip
was eighty-seven miles in twenty-four
hours, my average time being sixty-four
miles. I rode with light tires until I got
to Ogden, when I was obliged to change
them for these heavy road ones. They
were punctured eighty times over the Ne
brasKa desert, where I frequently had to
ride over fields of cactus plants. These
heavy tires were punctured but twice.
"I propose to leave here as soon as I see
my way clear to get away. I will go either
to Japan or Australia, as circumstances
will permit, and I expect to be back next
fall, having consumed about eighteen
months in visiting this country, Japan,
India, Austria, Germany, France and
England."
Brown carries with him a water canteen,
a small gripsack, a cane ana a crutch, ail
of which are strapped on tbe N right side of
his wheel, where tney offer a resting-place
for the stump of his leg.
AFRICAN CHURCH WORK
Bishop Galnes on the Religions Effects
Among Freedmen of California
and Elsewhere.
Biehop W. J. Games of the African M.
E. Church, who has been on a visit to
Washington and Oregon, arrived here
yesterday and is at the Russ. His home
is in Atlanta, Ga. He is very much de
lighted, so he said yesterday, at what he
has seen on the Pacific Coast.
"We have here." he said yesterday,
"about 1000 members. That is not very
many apparently, but it is really a good
many, for our population here is very
light. The African M. E. Church has
-700,000 members, eleven Bishops, and
churches all over the United States. Be
sides this, it has missions in Africa, Nova
Scotia, Bermuda and Hayti.
"I am very much pleased with what I
have seen of the Pacific Coast; people are
broad minded and hospitable. I wrote a
letter, a few days ago, to the Atlanta Con
stitution, in which I said that 50,000 in
dustrious colored people could rind homes
and employment on the Pacific Coast.
Last Sunday I preached at the First M. E.
Church in Seattle, at the invitation of the
minister, and I never saw a finer audience
in my lite. It was a white audience, of
course, and they were willing to listen to
a colored man, and treat him with all the
consideration received by any white pas
tor."-
The Bishop left for Los Angeles last
night. He was accompanied on his trip
by his daughter.
AT THE CARNIVAL.
French Day and the Tableau of the
First Singing of the â¢â¢*â¢Â«â *
seillaiae."
Yesterday was French day at the his
torical carnival in Native Sons' Hall, on
Mason street, between Post and Geary.
The beautiful booth of La Belle France
was the center of attraction, and the
girls, clothed in the national tricolor,
were the first ladies of the fairy carnival
scene.
In the evening a concert was given with
the following excellent programme:
Duo by Mile. Elena Roeckel and Mme.
Roeckel; tenor solo, Charles Morel; chanson,
Mile. Alice Decourtienx: va.se charlee, Mme.
Prosper Reiter: mandoline melodic, Mile.
Roeckel; chanson, Prosper Reiter; couplets,
Mme. Ellen Coursen - Roeckel ; romance,
Charles Morel.
At the conclusion of the concert a tab
leau was eiven by the mnsic booth, the
subject being "Rouget de Lisle singing
the Marseillaise for the first time before
Dietrick, the Mayor of Strasbourg, in
1792." The participants were John P.
R. W. BROWN.
Duffy, Milton Washerman, Oscar Frank,
Alfredo Borlini, William Conlon, Frank
Poulsen ana Charles Wescott, Mrs. Wil
liam B. Hunt, Mme. Prosper Reiter, Mrs.
Gilbert Wnilaker and Mi3s Dora Cohn.
To-day will be the Scotch, Irish and
Gypsy day.
EMMA ASHLEY IS FREE,
Found Not Guilty of Assault to
Murder Millionaire E.
J. Baldwin.
It Took the Jury Only Two Minutes
to Determine Her In
nocence.
The farce of trying Emma Ashley for as
sault to commit murder in having shot at
E. J. Baldwin was yesterday concluded.
As was predicted several days ago, the jury
acquitted her in less than five minutes.
The party most injured in the entire
matter was the City and County, which
had to pay several hundred dollars for a
long-winded trial, the conclusion of which
was practically foregone.
Yesterday's proceedings, arguments and
all, were dull and uninteresting. Dr. John
W. Robertson was on the stand in the
morning and testified as an expert on in
sanity. He gave it as his opinion, in
answer to a hypothetical question, that
the defendant was sane at the time the
shot was fired. The afternoon was con
sumed by the arguments of Assistant
District Attorney Piexotto, General
Friedrichs and the charge to the jury.
The only occurrence out of the ordinary
was the manner in which the prisoner's
counsel scored Millionaire Baldwin. He
said among other thines that it was a stain
upon the honor of the State that the horse
man should go unwhipped for his actions
during the past forty years.
The time consumed in actual dolibera
tion by the jury was exactly two minutes.
On the return to the courtroom it was re
ported that "We, the jury, rind the ac
cused not guilty, by reason of insanity."
Emma Asnley, on hearing the verdict,
quicitly rose and said to the jurymen,
"Gentlemen, I thank you." One or two
emotional females among the spectators
burst into tears; the attorneys congratu
lated the Ashley sisters and a trial that
has been utterly devoid of anything sensa
tional was ended.

Three boys broke into the residence of
W. Loncaa, 804 Greenwich street, about 1
o'clock yesterday afternoon, and were ran
sacking the rooms when Loncas came
upon the scene.
The boys ran out of the house, pursued
by Lonca?. When they reached the mid

RAINEY'S SLATE
FOR THE BENCH
The Junta Nominates Jus
tices and Police
Judges.
MR.O'DONNELL'S STRING
The Slate Went Through With
Expedition, Harmony and
Satisfaction.
TEX DOLLARS IS IMPERATIVE
On Monday Night the Convention Will
Gamble en the Supreme Court
Reversing Itself.
The Rainey Democratic municipal con
vention held another session in Odd Fel
lows' Hall ias,t night during which Jus
tices of the Peace and Police Judges were
nominated and three unimportant resolu
tions passed. According to the Rainey-
Lanigan programme the convention ad
journed until next Monday evening
after deciding to nominate a full munici
pal ticket in view of the remote pos
sibility that the Supreme Court may re
verse itself regarding the* four- year term
on Garret McEnerney's motion for a re
hearing in the county government case.
The convention thus has before it not
only ihe nominations for Superintendent
of Schools, School Directors and Super
visors, but for the offices which the Su
preme Court decided were to be filled only
every four years.
These nominations create new interest
in the convention, and the "anarchist"
combination is being revived. The nomi
nation for the county clerkship appears
to be the leading fight, and John F. Me-
Govern, the Third-street merchant and
secretary of the General Committee, is
again at the front with the prospect of
getting the nomination, which depends
for its value en the hazard of McEnerney's
petition.
The convention was called to order late
by Chairman Ragan. The attendance was
smaller than usual and the proceedings
constituted a noisy but good-natured and
smooth pulling through of the slate.
Attorney Joseph E. O'Donnell, whose
voice had already so often been heard in
the. convention as a representative of the
Rainey-Lanigau power, became a regular
judge-maker.
He has been mightily interested in the
judicial slate from the start, and at the
preceding session had nominated Frank
J. Murasky for (Superior Judge â he whom
the Buckieyites are aDout to kick off their
ticket for letting the thing occur. Mr.
O'Donnell at the former session also sec
onded another nomination, and last night
he nominated a Justice of the Peace and
then a Police Judge.
The nominations made were as follows:
Police Judgesâ C. G. Conlon. George A.
Proctor, J. A. Spinnetti, Stephen R.
O'Keefe.
Justices of the Peace â John J. Kennedy,
John A. Carroll. William T. Hess, Michael
O'Gara, Sands For man.
At 9 p. m. the convention came to order
and Secretary Saulman read a report from
the committee on resolutions, reporting
favorably the resolutions referred at the
last session providing respectively that
the chairman of the convention, the com
mittee on platform and the general com
mittee of the party be a committee to
look after the observance of the platform
by nominees, if elected; in favor of paying
the municipal debt and in favor of the
passage of a pure primary law by the next
Legislature. The report was adopted in a
perfunctory way.
A further resolution submitted by the
committee on resolutions recommended
that nominations for a full municipal
ticket be made in view of the possibility
of the Supreme Court granting a rehear
ing in the county government case involv
ing the length of terms of municipal
officers. This resolution enumerated the
offices to which the Supreme Court award- j
ed four-year terms, viz.: County Clerk, j
Sheriff, Recorder, Coroner, Public Admin
istrator and City and County Attorney.
On motion, consideration of the resolu
tion was postponed "until next Monday
evening," which was in effect, a resolution
to hold a future session on that day.
The chairman took up the course of
nominations by announcing that nomina
tions for Police Judge were in order. The
slate at once went through smoothly.
Eugene N. Deuprey took the platform
and lv a few nice words nominated Police
Judge Charles G. Conlan, whereat the boys
cheered again and again. Once again was

it shown in a municipal convention that
the "push" knows its friend.
Joseph E. O'Donnell took the stage, as
usual, at this point. Mr. O'Donnell is a
remarkably important part of the Rainey
convention. He is the great nominator of
that aggregation of political journeymen.
Mr. O'Donnell nominated a Superior
Judge, a Police Judge and a Justice of the
Peace, besides seconding the nomination
of one of each variety of Judge, and also
had his say on the platform in connection
with most of the ticket.
Mr. O'Donnell nominated George A.
Proctor,"a graduate of Santa Clara College,
who four years ago poiled 16,000 votes for
Police Judge."
Herbert Choynski took the sta-e, men
tioned "the glorious work that has been
mapped out" for the convention, and
named J. A. Spinetti.
W. J. Locke nominated "a well-known
resident of the Mission," Stephen R.
O'Keefe.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
JamÂ«B E. Runcie put C. G. Conlan's
name before the convention.
C. A. Reynolds seconded the nomination
of O'Keefe and Deuprey that of Proctor,
whereupon nominations closed and the
ticket was declared.
There were calls for all the nominees
but none responded and nominations for
Justices of the Peace followed.
George Gallagher named John J. Ken
nedy and Joseph E. O'Donnell put John
A. Carroll in nomination.
Hugo K. Asher nominated William T.
Secretary Saulman Studying.
Hess, son of the chief proprietor of the
German Demokrat Mr. Hess Sr. had
been a slate nominee for Treasurer, but he
stepped aside to give his son a show.
H. C. Gesford, who is getting into local
politics as deeply and prominently as he
can since his removal to the Ciiy, fol
lowed.
"Possibly sentiment has no place at this
time â this is a practical convention," said
the ex-Senator of the interior. "I was
born and raised in a little county
north of San Francisco â Napa County â
and from boyhood to manhood,
one of my truest friends was
Michael O'Gara. [Great cheering.] He
was true to his family in his struggles to
maintain them, and one of bis boys he
sent to that great institution at Santa
Clara which has produced a White, a Del
Valle, a Dennis Spencer and others like
them. It eives me pleasure to nominate
John O'Gara â a good old Democratic
name. Vote for him."
C. A. Reynold nominated Sands For-
WiU Be Satisfied "With Most Any

man, nominations closed at once, and tbe
acclamation process followed.
On motion of E. N. Deuprey, amended
by Herbert Choynski, it was ordered that
the names of all who seek rominations
for Supervisor or School Director must be
banded to the secretary, to be published,
and that they be not acted upon by the
convention until Monday evening.
E. P. E. Troy, with an eye to the best
and not the usual convention methods of
disposing of the ten-dollar pieces collected
from all candidates for nominations,
moved that there be appointed a treasurer
and an auditing committee and that any
possible surplus be turned over to the gen
eral committee.
There were howls of "No!" and Deuprey
got in a motion that candidates for School
Director be excepted from the $10 tax
called a "donation" out of formal respect
to the purity of election laws.
W. P. Sullivan made a point of order,
which somehow involved the considera
tion that if aspirants for the Board of
Education were excepted there might not
be enough to go around among the big
crowd of sergeants-at-anus and secretaries,
and the whole proposition was buried,
whereupon the convention adjourned nntil
Monday evening.
The following candidates for nomination
for School Director were reported to the
secretary: George S. Bachman, dentist, 6
Eddy street; Benjamin Armer, book
keeper, 2815 Pine; C. A. Bautel, 427 Lar
kin; J. J. McCarthy, secretary of the City
Hall Commission, 270 Minna; Michael
Byrne, merchant, 1235 Green; George
Walcom, furniture, 402 Sutter; Dr. Horace
Laidlaw, 1715 Broderick.
The following additional aspirants for
the Board of Supervisors were registered
at $10 apiece: W. O'Connell, Seventh
Ward, 326 Powell street ; M. C. McGrath
Ninth Ward, hotel, 530 Fourth street; j!
D. Griffin, Eleventh Ward, boat-builder

will leap with joy â then the
bright spirit will shine forth in
your eye, and the happy smile
in your countenance will tell
your acquaintances that you
have found a new existence.
Then you meet your friends
with the strong clasp of the
hand and the look of confidence
which tell them that "here it
the new-born man." .
Your every action bespeaks
new manhood. You are then a
better man physically and men-
tally than if you had never
known weakness.
"You can say that I was
nearly a wreck in every way.
but I am now a better man than
I ever thought of being," says
L. L. Jaccard, the Jeweler, of
San Leandro, Cal., after using
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
Some men feel that they are
not weak, though they are not
what they might be in manly*
vigor had they not lightly trans-
gressed the laws of Nature.
These are just the ones who
most appreciate the value of Dr.
Sanden's Belt. In a few weeks
they learn that it can make them,
twice as strong as they were.
"Before I began using your
Belt I thought there was not
much the matter with me, but
after using, it a month I have
found the value of good health .**
says Wm. Simpson, Goleta, Cal.
Electricity is wonderful in its
strengthening influence. You*
vitality seems to grow stronger
and more buoyant every, day.
There seems no limit to your
Clergies. You can do twice the
amount of work you formerly]
could, aiid not get weary.
"I can do as much work as
any two men now," says L*
C. Minyard, Napa, Cal.
Words cannot tell of the
gratitude felt by the men
who have been restored to man-,
.hood by Dr. Sanden's Electria
Belt. Will you become one of
its happy patients? You can-
learn how great has been its
good work by reading the little
book, "Three Classes of Men,'*
which Dr. Sanden will send you
free, closely sealed, on request.

A glandered horse was killed in front of
the Board of Health office yesterday, by
Secretary Holbrook of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. A ped
dler called in the morning and reported
that he had bought the horse, which was
evidently sick, for $5, and wanted to know
what was the matter with the animal.
An examination by the veterinary of the

WAS AFIELD FOR RUSSIA
Colonel De Wogack, Military
Agent of the Czir, Is in
the City.
Colonel de Wogack, for five years past
military agent of Russia in China and
Japan, and who accompanied Li Hung
Chang on bis trip throughout Europe, and
as far as New York, arrived here yester
day and ii'at the Palace.
The colonel is one of the most distin
guished niilitary'men in the Orient. He
served all through the Chinese-Japanese
war, and was an eyewitness to most of the
great battles., He left the Orient in April
lass, and was with Li Hung Chang at the
coronation of the Czar. He then attended
the great exhibition in London with him,
and afterward accompanied the noted
Chinese to Fari3 and other great cities.
"I was in the Japanese army with
Marshal Yamagata." said Colonel do Wo
gak. "I went with him through Korea,
and was also with him in Manchuria. I
saw a great many of the engagements,
witnessing them for ray Government and
studying the situation.

Port Arthur, seeing the great : contest
there, and so continued until the close of
the war.
'â¢The difference between Japan and
China in this war was, that Japan had
trained soldiers. Of course she had good
warships and they were well manned, ana
the arms on sea and on shore were all that
could be desired. China had good arms
too, but her soldiers were not trained; the
difference was in the training.
":â  "So far as the story of the press Jdis
patches is concerned, that the purpose of
the visit of Li Hung Chang to the different
countries of the wo) Id was preparatory to
opening the ports of China, 1 believe the
ports are all pretty well opened now. Li
Hung Chang has stood his trip well, not
withstanding the fact that he is 74
years old. I got a letter from some of
his friends since my arrival here, and they
tell me that he got through in excellent
condition. . >
"Now. as to the story that Russia is
about to take possession of Korea, it seems
tome that Russia does not intend to do
this or it would have been done long ago.
Bhe could have taken possession of the
country at any timeÂ»she desired, but Rus
sia did not do so, and, as I understand it,
she only wants that Korea shall remain an
independent country. You know the
Government there has not been very stable
for a good while.
"As for Japan losing Formosa, as has
also been reported, I see no reason why it
should lose that country.; There is nobody
there except some Chinese and some na
tives that it can easily keep in subjection,
and there is no cause whatever that I can
see why Japan should lose Formosa."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 1896
FOUND DRESSED
IN DEATH ROBES
Phillip Phillips, a Tailor,
Attempts to Commit
Suicide.
WELL-KNOWN FORESTER
He Was Short in His Accounts
as Treasurer of Court
Washington.
SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE
Left a Number of Letters, in Some of
Which He Bitterly Attacks a
Wei:.Rnown Rabbi.
Philip Phillips, a tailor at 7 Lddy street,
made careful preparations for ending his
life in his shop yesterday morning. He
dressed himself in the Jewish death robes,
PHILIP PHILLIPS at the Receiving Hospital.
locked and bolted the door, swallowed a
dose of chloroform and lay down on a pile
of cloth to die.
Attorney Nagle happened to call at
Phillips' shop, and was surprised to find it
locked and the curtains down. He spoke
to F. K. Weiss, the florist, next door,
about It, and together they went in search
of Policeman Frank Eiley. The three
tried to open the door, but it resisted their ;
combined efforts, and finally they broke
the glass in the door and were able to
force an entrance.
They found Phillips, in an unconscious
condition, and he was driven rapidly to
the Receiving Hospital in the patrol
wacon. Dr. Rinne administered antidotes
without effect, and the conclusion was
reached that his prospect of recovery was
very slight.
Phillips â¢ was a- prominent member of
j the Ancient Order of Foresters. He was
| a past chief ranger and at present holds
j the office of deputy chief ranger of Court
I Magnolia and treasurer of Court Washing-
I ton. : He was short in his accounts to
j Court Washington, which was discovered
about two weeks ago. The Surety Com
j pany, being appiised of the shortage,
i threatened to have him arrested, but his
friends came to his rescue and promised
to make good the shortage yesterday.
They were unable to do so and asked for
and obtained another day's grace.
Ever since the shortage was discovered
Phillips had been threatening to poison
himself. About a week ago he attempted
to swallow a dose of carbolic acid, but a
friend happened to be present and took
the bottle from him. Yesterday morning
about 10 o'clock ho showed another friend
a bottle and said he was going to poison
himself with it. Ho appeared greatly
worried about what the Surety Company
would do, although his friend told him it
would be all right.
Phillips was also in debt to the extent of
â¢bout $200, and he was unhappy in bis
domestic relations. His wife and daugh
ter left him about a year ago, and have
been living at 425 Stevenson street. When
Policeman Riley called upon Mrs. Phillips
ana notified her that her husband had taken
poison she remarked that he was a fool. - He
asked her to go with him to see her hus
band, but she at first objected that her
dinntr would be spoiled. bhe finally went
with him, and raised a row because the
glass in the door had been broken. At
the hospital she said, she was forced to
leave him, as his whole time was given up
'to attending lodge meetings.
Phillips left a number of letters, which
were found in his vest pockets. One, ad
dressed to Court Washington, had on the
corner "If not delivered return to Philip
Phillips, Hills of Eternity." Another was
addressed to Court Magnolia Â¥ a third to
his brother, Joel Phillips,' Sydney, Aus
tralia, and the fourth to F. K. Weiss. .â¢â¢
An opened unsigned letter to his wife
reads as follows: â â â â â 
Dear Sarah: I have written to the Coroner
not to take me to the Morgue; he also haa a
letter. .
I also wrote to the Rev. Rabbi Julius Fryer
to officiate at the funeral; 11 -Jake 'would' not
object I would' lika to bo buried alongside
Hetty. â¢.â â¢'.-..,â¢--;â '- â *: y.-
You .will find a small Mexican lottery ticket
In my purse for Thursday; also pawn ticket
for my watch, ring and pin. My gold pin is in
my vest pocket. My rent is paid to October 1.
If you keep it Charley will be glad to buy you
out.
Phillips also sent a big batch of letters,
evidently intended for publication, to the
Coroner. They were replete with harsh
sentiments ceriously reflecting on a well
known rabbi. The letter to Dr. Hawkins
read as follows: .
September 16, 1896. -
Dr. Hawkins, Coroner, or Hit Deputies, Wil
liam Ilallett and the Others: You are suri>*ised
to get this from me, but as we are friends and
brotners you will oblige mo by complying with
my request. Do not take *me to ttie Morgue,
but let me remain where I amor send me to
McGlnty. â¢ A post-mortem Is not necessary, as
you will see by the verdict 1 write. But you
can say if you wish that the hypocrite, black
leg, tliief, Rev. . is morally the cause of it
From December 5. 1885, to Juno 14, 1888, he
demanded and collected from my wife during
my absence every month from ana to those
dates money represented to be paid to the
enfeebla-minded institution, He did not pay
it in the institution, but appropriated it to bis
own use. -lie also bough tone and a half tickets
to Australia May 8, 1886, at special rates under
the guisa.of a minister and; lor charity and
sold them at full rates. â¢ â¢ â¢ Colonel Har
vey was anxious to send him to San Qnentin,
but I stopped It, and . ibat is the gratitude of a
pious hypocrite who walks -the street seeking
victims whom we never hear of, and , the
Third-street pawnbroker, is his ally, who re
spects men of his caliber. â - It Is well for the re
jspectabie people to know who they talk to or as- .
sneiate with. Why would not thÂ« congrega
tion elect him? Because they are respectable
people^ â knew him, and that he wotild be a dis
grace to the pulpit. I will say no more, only
be is a disgrace to the congregation and the
Jewish community.
I remain, dear doctor, or your deputies,
Hallet, MeGinnis or McCormlck, your frater
nal brother, Phillip Phillips.
The desperate man seemed to be mindful
even of small thing 3, as will be seen from
the following verdict prepared for the
Coroner's jury, which he presumed would
be called :
We, the undersigned, convened to inquire
into the cause of death of the deceased, do find
that his name is Phillip Phillips, born in
London, England, September 23. 1839, that
he died by his own hands by taking chloro
form and carbolic acid witn suicidal intent or
otherwise, and, as deceased claims, that Rev.
Is morally responsible for his ingratitude,
after saving him from being sent to San
Quentin for being a blackleg, thief and extort
ing money under false pretenses and embez
ling the same.
To this is added a postscript, which
reads :
The verdict as written is true in every par
ticular, and the above ahout is my dying
declaration. And now that I am dead, Mr.
Jake Silverstein, B. Kitchinski or my wife will
not tell a lie for him. I don't believe they will.
Inclose find what 1 wrote for publication,
Phillip Phillips.
There were half a dozen other letters,
one being addressed to his wife and a sec
ond to the public at large. In all of these
he referred in bitter terms of the reverend
gentleman who, he claims, ruined his
life. Attached to his wife's letter is a
check for $3 75, payable to his daughter
Pauline and drawn on the First National
Bank. Phillips also left an inscription
for his tombstone, as follows:
PHILIP PHTLLIPS,
Loving husband of Sarah and affectionate
father of l'au'ine Phillips.
BORN
September 23, 1839.
DIED
September â , 1896.
P. C. R. Court Washington 37, F. of A.
In the letter addressed to the public
Phillips tells his friends not to worry
about his shortage, as the Surety Com
pany will make it good.
Phillips regained consciousness last
night, but he was too weak to talk. The
doctors think that he will recover.
GROCERS GET READY.
The Association of Retail Dealers Oil
cuts Plans for the Coining
Campaign.
The political situation formed the sub
ject of debate at a large and enthusiastic
-meeting of the Retail Grocers' Association
last ni^bt.
Mr. Nobmann explained that, pursuant
to an invitation issued by tbe directors of
the Retail Grocers' Association, commit
tees from various organizations of liquor
dealers met and decided to leave all action
to a meeting of tbe directors of all the in
terested associations.
This meeting waa called and it was de
cided to form a club to be composed of
three delegate from each association. Of
this club, which was named the Whole
sale and Retail Liquor Dealers' League,
Mr, Nobmann said be had been made vice
chairman. He then outlined their plans
bo far as they were perfected.
A list was to'be made of the 12,000 men
interested in the liquor business. To each
of these, a day or so before election, a
ticket would be mailed bearing the name 3
of tboso candidates who were friendly to
the interests of the liquor-dealers. These
men the liquor-dealers would be expected
to vote for. Mr. Nobmann also explained
that precautions were being taken to pre
vent any imitation of the ticket used by
the league.
Numerous speeches followed. Tney
showed that the members of the associa
tion were all in earnest and were deeply
interested in the outcome of the pending
election. b
A DIAMOND BADGE.
Captain Wittman Honored With a
HamUomn Gift by the Mer-
chants Last Right.
Last night certain of San Francisco's
representative merchants assembled at
Bergez's restaurant, 334 Pine street, and
after a sumptuous least presented Captain
Wittman with a most beautiful diamond
badge as a token of their appreciation.
M. J. Bahlein made the toast to Captain
Wittman, which was responded to very
appropriately by Attorney Charles L.
Welier. s
Weller showered encomiums upon Cap
tain Wittman and the Police Department
in general, after whic^i he presented the
officer with the badge. It consisted of a
gold and silver shield. Across the top, in
gold letters on blue enamel, was inscribed
"Captain of Police." At the buse wa*
a bear, emblematic of the State, and the
initials S. Â¥. ; in the center was a large
diamond; on the back wasinscrioed, -'Pre
sented to Captain Geo/ge W. Wittman by
tue merchants of San Francisco, Septem
ber, 1896. Committee, S. C. Beaver. F. M.
duff and John McCarthy."
In response, Japtain Wittman said that
this waa one of the occasions when his
heart was too full for utterance, but he
hoped he \\ui 1 I never do anything to
bring discrete i.j.un the emblem.
Supervisor Dimond arose and compli
mented tbe captain on his gift, saying he
hoped it would be chanced only in case of
promotion. Captain Wittman in reply
paid an eloquent tribute of respect to Chief
Crowley. Tne gathering adjourned amid
general conviviality and good will.

JOHN F. MORE AS -
AN EMBEZZLER
Judge Coffey Officially
Makes That Grave
Accusation.
OVER $12,000 MISSING.
Removed From tha Adminis
â¢ tratorship of the A. P.
More Estate.
ELIZA MILLER SUBSTITUTED.
Santa Rosa Island Cattle Were Sold
and the Proceeds Not Ac
counted For.
Judge Coffey yesterday removed John
F. More from his position as adminis
trator of the estate of A. P. More, and in
cidentally remarked that the ex-admims
trator has been guilty, among other
misdeeds, of embezzling $12,000 belonging
to the estate.
A. P. More was a wealthy owner of live
stock, and died October 23, 1893. leaving
no will.
On February 12, 1894, John F. More was
appointed administrator of his estate, part
of which consisted of 1500 head of cattle
and 40 ; 000 sheep at pasture on Santa Rosa
Island.
John F. More continued in complete
charge of the affairs of the immense prop
erty until a few months ago, when Mrs.
Eliza Miller, one of the heirs at law of the
deceased, became convinced that all was
not as it should be, and made application
to have More ousted. He was temporarily"
suspended by Judge Coffey aod Mrs
Miiler granted special letters of adminis
tration.
As a result of the investigation which
followed, Judge Coffey made the order
filed yesterday. His Honor says in part:
"I find that between October 1, 1895, and
January 1, 1896, John F. More embezzled
from the iunds intrusted to him $12,000.
During the period named he sold a num
ber of cattle to t.*ie Western Meat Com
pany, from which concern ne received
over 114,000, |12,000 of. which he has failed
to account for.
"When the estate was turned over to
Mr. More there were on Santa Rosa Island
40,000 sheep and 1500 cattle. A commis
sioner sent to investigate has reported
that there are now on the island 25,389
sheep. Mr. More reported to this court
that the full number was there when he
knew there were less than 31,000 on hand.
"A lot of abalone shells, etc.. have also
been fold and the proceeds appropriated
oy the administrator.
"The land has also been depastured by
stock belonging to John F. More person
ally."
Judge Coffey further recites how Mr.
More has time and again failed to be pres
ent in court when cited to appear and how
other judicial orders have been disre
garded, and concludes by ordering his re
moval from the administratorship.
Mrs. Eliza Miller is appointed in More's
stead, and proceedings to recover the
missing funds will probably be at once in
stituted.
KELLY-MAHONEY.
Some Further Nominations Made
and Some Verbal Bouquets
Thrown.
The Kelly-Mahoney followers assembled
at Pioneer Hall last night and added
names to their list of self-sacrificing as
pirants for public office.
Judge John F. Finn and Judge John
Hunt sent letters accepting their nomina
tions and promising to render all the as
sistance in their power to elect the nomi
nees of the convention.
A delegate vouched for Carroll Cook's
acceptance of the nomination for the Su
perior bench.
Delegate Ruef placed Edward I. Sheehan
in nomination for the office of Tax Col
lector. Captain Blennerhasset of the
water front, in a spread-eagle speech, sec
onded the nomination.
Sheehan was declared the nominee by
acclamation. He appeared and indorsed
the platform.
Secretary A. J. Morgenstern placed
Archibald Barnard in nomination for the
position of City and County Attorney.
There were no others who sought the
office.
Gaston Strauss placed David L. Farns
worth in nomination for Street Superin
tendent. He went through on a rush, not,
however, without a positive "no" from
Ray Falk, who said that was the first time
in his life that he did not swallow the pro
gramme.
Colonel Kowalsky nominated Madison
Babcock for Superintendent of Schools.
He went through, but later on Martin
Kelly discovered that there was a blur on
the slate, and he consequently gave notice
of reconsideration at to-night'a meeting,
when no doubt Babcock will come down,
as the push does not want him.
H. I. Willey and Lott D. Norton were
placed in nomination for Surveyor. Nor
ton was the boys' favorite, consequently
he won out by a vote of 191 to 47 for Willey.
Leon Dennerv was nominated for the
Assembly for the Forty-third, John R.
Glassford for the Thirty-ninth and 11. W.
Littlefield for the Thirty-seventh.
Quite an array of names were placed be
fore the convention for Supervisors from
the twelve wards of the City.
Previous to adjourning James McCa be
offered a series of resolutions lauding the
convention and finding fault with all
those who do not bow down before the
Kelly-Mahoney throne.
The People's Church.
The People's Church at the Metropolitan
Temple, Fifth street, Rev. D. W. L. Birch min
ister, will open on Sunday night, 7:45 o'clock
sharp. All seats free. Collections will be
taken up for widows and orphans.
Irish Wit.
The well from which Irish stories are
drawn is inexhaustible. Here is a good
example oi Pat's wit and readiness. An
Irish witness was being examined as to
his knowledge of a .shooting affair. "Did
you see the shot fired?" the magistrate
aaketi. "No, sorr. I only. heard it," was
the evasive reply. "That evidence is not
â¢atisfactory,' ' replied the magistrate stern
ly; "stand down!"
The witness turned round to leave the
box. and directly his back was turned he
laughed derisively. Toe magistrate, in
dignant at this contempt of court, called
him back, and asked him how he dared to
laugh in court. "Did ye see me lauirb,
your Honor?" queried the offender. "Nc,
sir. but I heard you," was the irate reply.
"That evidence is not satisfactor)-," said
Pat quietly, but with a twinkle in his eye.
And this time everybody Janghed except
the magistrate.â Westminster Gazette.

â *~ i .
How many unfortunate men have vio-
lated the. laws of nature and are now pay-
ing the penalty? / .
Some have been addicted to foolish
habits in their youth; some have over-
indulged later in life; wnilo others have
wearied themselves into unmanly wtak-
uess over bad crops, business reverses or
financial failure. In one way or another
they have overdrawn on their stock of
vitality, which is getting dangerously low.
As. a consequence they have lost their
grip on life. Every little annoyance
seems a mountain of despair. Every
speck in the heavens looks like an over-
whelming shadow. Every cherished am-
bition is dead, and the poor, suffering
victim almost wishes he wore dead too.
He thinks of suicide. ' ,\.
Men, there is help for you. Don't brood
over your disgraceful weakness any longer,
but get strength at once. Get back to life.
Go to Doctor Cook, who will lift you *p
out of the slough of disease, disgrace and
despondency into which you have fallen

rTITW YORK. N. V., Sept. 23.â Sugar wan the
feature of the stock market to-day. It opened
slightly lower at 111% and soon dropped to 110%.
The decline was followed by purchases to cover
short contracts and a rise to 112% followed. The
transactions were heavy, the stock figuring for
62,900 shares, in a grand total of 22J.897 shares.
The erratic course of the stock naturally caused a
good deal of comment. One storr was that the In
siders had par ed with their speculative holdings.
A rumor which gained currency late In the day.
and which induced some selling, was to the effect
that the Mollenbauer refiner}- of Brooklyn would
Increase its capital to $20,000,000.
The significance of this statement lies In the
fact that the Mo lenhauer Company Is ontside of
the trust. Reading was next in point of activity
and sold up to 19%, the best price for a long time
past.. The bonds of ; he company were also in re
quest and scored material gains. The securities of
the company were Influenced by the completion of
the foreclosure proceedings at Philadelphia to
day. The general list ruled ra:her weak after the
opening on account of the heaviness of sugar ana
a belief that the Bank of England will advance its
ra'.e of discount. . A report was also afloat that the
bank In ended to put up its price for bar gold an 1
American eagles. This, it was argued,* would
check the flow of gold this way.
Nevertheless the sum of $1,500,000 additional
gold was withdrawn from the . bank to-day for ex
port, bringing the out! engagements on. the way
and delivered since August 28 last up to nearly
$41,000,000. lie downward movement In stocks
did not last long, and hy 2 o'clock the early looses
were not only recovered, .but In a number of in
stances the highest figures of the day were reached.
At the top notch the leading issues showed ad
vances of V*(Â§) 2 per cÂ«nt. Near the close when
SSuear develoi-ed renewed weakness, the entire
market sympathized and a recession of I4@li/i
per cent ensued, speculation closed barely steady.
Net changes were confined to fractious. Reading,
however, rose 1 and Chicago Gas % percent,
wbl.e sugar lost 1% per cent. In the inactive

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO. Iti., Sept. 23.â bullish temper
J of the wheat trade was more j pronounced and ag
gressive to-day than it has been at any- time since
the recent advance * was inaugurated. Prices
leaped quickly after the opening, and . after the
expiration of the first forty-five minutes were 1 Vac
hif uer than they closed yesterday. The situation
ore-.ented no new or startling features, but the
sentiment has ten hardening for some time, new
allies joining the bull ranks every day. North
western receipts were unexpectedly light to-day,
only 640 cars arriving against 932 last Wednes
day and 808 a year ai:O. A falling off was looked
for, but not quite so much as really took place.
Liverpool opening cables Â«ere 14 d higher, and an
advance of 1 Vs&l-I'i marks was quoted at Berlin
a: the opening. . Chicago received 169 cars and in
spected out 1Â°.'6,5&8 bushels.
The session was one of continuous flurry, reac
tions were of the most insignificant character and
each one was succeeded by renewed buying ex
citement. Closing . Liverpool advices were %d
I higher and Continental markets responded to our
advance without equivocation. The only disap
pointing circumstance was the absence of outside
trade, iocal operators t;ein_- the best traders. Ex
port clearances were' liberal at 406, .-(79 bushels.
December 1 wheat opened from 6-iysc to 63c, ad
vanced 10 65c, closing at 64%@tiac, 33/ -is2%c
higher tban yesterday. Estimated receipts for to
morrow 200 cars. â¢ :
COKNâ Was a laggard m the race. While prices
for this grain were fairly firm out of resi ect to tne
strength of wheat, nevertheless there was no
energy or vigor in the m. rket, and only mo 'crate
appreciation took place. Receipts were 405 cars,
35 more than estimated. Withdrawals from store
â¢ were 126.6.'*8 bushels. Liverpool cables were firm

A splendid line, worthy of Virgil or Mil

Then the three lines, of which Mrs.
Yardley quotes two, in "The Princess" :

The moan of doves in Immemorial elms.
And murmuring of innumerable bees.
Charles Kingsley praises these three lines

It was announced to-day that the Amer

ticket to be voted for at the coming elec
tion. An officer of the order said to-day:
"The several political parties oi Alameda
County having made their nominations,
under the plan of procedure adopted by
the American Protective Association, a
county convention of the members of the
order will be called to agree upon a ticket
to be supported by the A. P. A. in the
coming ele.-tion.
"Under these rules this convention will
be called on the basis of one delegate to
each twenty-five members and one for
each council. The order having eighteen
councils in Alameda County and a mem
bership Of some 3000 will give the conven
tion about 150 delegates. Candidates for
office and members of the advisory board
are not eligible to membership in the con
vention. vVith this larae membership,
which will vote the ticket selected by the
convention, the order expects to hold the
balance of power."
Very complete arrangements aro being
made for tue Republican meetine to be
held at the Tabernacle next Saturday
night. George A. Knight and D. K. Mo .
Kinlay will be the principal speakers, and ;
if possible a prominent suffrage speaker
will also make an address.
The most interesting point at present is }
that for control of the County Commit.cc.
There are thirteen members of the com
mittee, and the best guess at this time is j
that they stand six to six.
Joseph Johnston, the Supervisor from
the Fourth District, is of the opinion that
he, Church, Mautalen, Fletter, Striker,
Morrison and Riley will without doubt
stand toeether. and thÂ« same is true of
Breed, Palnrer. J. W. Evans, Robinson
and Hawes. This leaves Archibald and
Neal in doubt, and the doubt will proba
bly exist till a vote on chairman is taken
next Saturday.
Miss Bu an B. Anthony left Oakland this
inorn'ng to open up the campaign in Sac
ramento, where very little suffrage work
has yet been done. In this ciiy the "par
lor meetings" are being pushed and much
active work is being done by raffragi ts.
The lauit-s are now considering whether it
would be more advi.--.able during the ensu
ing f-ix weeks of the campaign to attempt
to obtain some lime for speaking at the
party political meetings or loconfine theni
selv a to purely suffragist meetings.
Bey. E'iza T. Wiikes bu stated that she

A Wealthy Rancher, Well-Advancei

Child of 14
Oakland Office San Fbakcisco Call, )
9CW Broadway. Sept. 23. f
Mjs. J. Furtadp, by her attorney, Ben if.
Woolner, filed an application this after
i noon for a writ o; habeas corpus, to com
pel the Azeredas family, at Twenty-third
avenue, to produce her child, a girl of 14
j yenrs of age.
Behind this application is a love story of
a romantic nature. The girl's mother
re ides in San Francisco, and the child has
been boarding with her brother at the
home of the Azeredases. It was while here
that Manuel Fur: ado, a man nearly 50
years of age, first met the pretty, dark
eyeii coquettish maiden. The casual
acquaintance soon ripened into something
more than mere friendship.
While the family n:ime is the same
there is no relationship between the two.
Tbe Romeo of the affair is a well-to-do
ranch-ir well advanced in age, but be de
clares nis lovp for .he child is ardent and
deep despite the discrepancy in ages. The
mother, however, objected when she
found how matters stood and refused her
consent to such a maniage and notified
the County Clerk not to issue any licenses
for the event.
All attempts to induce the girl to go
with her mother were futile and tha
mother now applies to the court to get
control of her, charging the Azeredas
fanvilv with <onceaiine ;he cbiid until
arrangements can be made io get her and
her lover to sea. wht-re there would be no
bar t-> a marriage. She declares that Fur
tado lu.s spent money lavishly to induce
the Azeredas to hold ihe nirl for him.

LIFE SAVED BY
A RUBBER BAND
The Remarkable Escape of
an Electric Railroad
Motorman.
MELTED A GOLD CHAIN
His Watchguard Came in Con
tact With an Open Controller
on His Car.
RECEIVED THE FULL VOLTAGE.
The Current Burned His Coat and
Vest but Stopp d When It Met
the Rubber.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. Sept. 23.âMotor
man E. V. Marx of the Alameda, Oakland
ana Piedmont electric line has been receiv
ing congratulations all day on his narrow j
escape from instant death yesterday. He
received the full voltage of the electric
current and lived to tell of it.
It was during the rain of yesterday
morning that the accident happened. !
The car, being thoroughly wet, acted as a
first-class conductor, and when a watch
chain came in contact with an open con
troller-box it completed a circuit which
came near killing Mr. Marx. The car
â¢was on Santa Clara avenue, near Webster
street, at the time of the accident, and as
a result he is wearing a new coat and vest
to-day.
Marx made the following report of the
accident to the officials of the line. He
said : "I had burned out one of my motors,
and opened the controller box to fit a new
one. After working at it I left the box
open ana ran the car along. When 1 had
an opportunity I leaned over to see how
everything was going. All of a sudden
there was a blindine flash and I was
thrown violently back against the front
door of the car. I was the most surprised
man imaginable; but on fathering myself
together I found that I was not injured,
but my watch-chain was melted into a
shapeless mass and my coat was burned
badly on the side where my watch 7?as.
"I was surprised to find my watch was
not ruined, but I bave decided that it was
saved by a mere chance. Some tince ago
1 broke my chain and fastened my watch
on by a rubber band. That was a non
conductor and stopped the current."
Many reports have been made of men
who received electric shocks during rain
storms, but this is tbe most serious case
yet reported.
WILL STUDY THE BRAIN,
New Psychological Laboratory
for the State Univer
sity.
Dr. Stratton Will Toke Charge-Fifty
Students Already En
rolled.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 23.â The estab
lishment of the new psychological labora
tory at the State University, for which ar
rangements are now being made, wiil
mark an era in tbe history of the depart
ment of philosophy at Berkeley.
The Board of Regents have set aside
about $1200 which will be used in the con
struction of a special laboratory for the
use of the department.
Dr. George M. Stration will take charge
of the work.
About fifty students have already regis
tered for courses in the department, but
as yet little practical work has been
accomplished because of lack of room and
the unfavorable condition of the building
in which the apparatus is stored.
Dr. Stratton, in speaking to-day of the
new line of work to be inaugurated at
Berkeley, said:
"The psychological laboratory will
serve var.oas purposes. By means of it
the nature of experimental psychology
can be brought before students with a
deriniteness and force that can never be
attained merely by reading or by listen
in.- to lectures.. Another work will be
that of investigating in various fields
which have hitherto never been subjected
to experiment.
"The nature of the experiments in
psychology requires that the laboratory
be in some quiet, isolated spot, and that a
| number of rooms be at the disposal of the
investigators. The person experimented

Psychological Laboratory at the State University.
upon must, as far as possible, be protected
from outer disturbances.
"He i* generally placed in a room sound
proof and absolutely dark and communi
cates solely by means of an electric key
with the- person conducting the experi-
m ent. Then there must be room for elec-
I trie batteries and for chemicals, a separate
! room where the delicate instruments are
kept, and a room from which prisms,
lense-* or reflectors can carry any desired
ray of liirht to a screen before the eye of
the subject in the dark room. For the
teaching work of a laboratory a large
demonstration! room is also essential.
"The apparatus is tor the most part espe
cially designed for psychological experi
rnenrs. One peneral class of instruments
pres-nts with great nicety different ob
jects either to the eye or to the ear or to
one of the other senses.
"A second class of instruments is not for
producinc changes, but for recording
them. We have in this group instruments
for Doting lapses of time as short as a
thousandth of a second, or for recording
the slightest variations in the volume or
position of a given portion of the body,
all of which are valuable aids in psycho
logical investigation."
Special Tax Levied.

the election recently held in Berkeley, for
the purpose of securing new school build

JAMES HILL, Night "Watchman of the Gty Hall, "Who Is
Considered to Be Worth His Salary.
salary that they did di?cuss. It was that
of old James Hill, the nightwatchiran of
the City Hall.
James Hill is probably the oldest ex-
Chief of a fire department in the
countyr. Sixty years ago Hill and Chief
Scannell were both connected with the
New York Volunteer Fire Depart
ment. Hill was a member of the
hand-engine company, wtiich hauled
the engine known to this day as
the "White Ghost," In 1343 Hill came
west to Cleveland, Ohio., and at onco
joined the volunteer fire department and
served until 1852, when he was appointed
fire warden. Two years later a paid de
partment was organizud and Mr. Hill was
made chief.
When the war broke out Hill joined a
"thirty-day" company and served in tho
Cleveland Grays under Captain Paddock.
Some time later he enlisted with the First
Ohio Volunteers under General Cook and
served with him for three years and took
part in the fi ht at Bull Run.
In 1864 Hill returned to Cleveland and
was at once reappÂ»inted Fi:e Chief. He
built up the det>arira rit rapidly and in
1875, owing to a political deal, he was re
moved and at once came to this coast. He j
Sfttled in Oakland and in a short time
he was appointed as a driver in the
Oakland department. Two years later he
wan appointed cliiei engineer and served
five years and' sevt-n months.
During ihe time Chief Hill .vas serving
as chiel here there was a reun on of the
old fire- lighters of C eveland, and a. though
he could net be with them he was not for- i
and his old fr ends sent him a solid s
silver trumpet, appropriately ngiaved.
In 1879 he was appointed niv.htw:.ti hman
at the City Hall, ana he is there yet.
"Ii I had b'-en as to my>eif as I ;
have been to others all my lite I stiould be [
a little richer to-day," said tlie old man at j
his dome, 818 Clay street. "I have helpfd |
people all my life and have occasionally j
set somebody tin in business, bat I have
mÂ»>i with a full share of ingratitude.
However, 1 am getting old now and o it
is no ui-e talking. I saved thai old City
Hall from fire on two occasions â once
when O'li ien was clerk and another time
when Lambert wuÂ» Police Court Clerk. I
go to the hah every nighi at 5 o'clock and
stay till 6.00 next morning. On Suuday 1
go there at 3:30, and lor the last seventeen
years the place has almost been my
home."
Hill is now 78 years of age, but he is still
an active man.

ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 23.â The many

I have only recently become aware of bis
whereabouts."
Mr. Cory said: "1 do not care to dis
cuss the matter at all. I left Chico two
years a o, alter losing considerable prop
erly, and located litre. I could not get

ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept. 23.â The case
of the W&tsons over the control of their
two children was partially heard before
Judge Otrden in the Superior Court to- |
day. Mr. Watson introduced the much
ialked-oi photographs of Reed, a painter,
and bit* 11-year-olu daughter, as taken by
Dr. Carpenter. They show Reed situnt:
by a lence with ttie chiid sitting by his
s;ue. All of the testimony went to show
that the girl had carried messages from
her mother to Reed.
Mrs. Watson's defense ia that she was
using 11 <-d to gather facts for use in her
divorce case, and used her daughter as a
messenger.
The order forbidding Mr. Watson from
visiting his home was vacated by the
Judge, who stated that it was not the
court's jurisdiction to separate a nusDand
and wiie, but rather to keep them in har
mony.

POLITICS IN OREGON.
Joseph Holladay Says Every
thing Is Very Much
Chopped Up.
tomething Necessary in Order to Set
the Idle Men at Workâ Silver
Arguments Unsound.
Joseph Holladay of Portland, Or.,
brother of Ben Holladay, founder of the
Pony Express and overland stage, is at
the Occidental. Mr. Holladay is one of
tbe oldest and wealthiest residents of
Portland. He has acquired a gteat deal of
real estate there and has lons been one of
the distinguished citizens of Oregon.
He says that Oregon, as well as the en
tire coast, as he views it, is in a peculiar
condition just now. In Oregon, he says,
so far as politics is concerned, things
could not be in a worse chopped up con
dition. You meet a Bryan man and ha
claims everything for Bryan; meet a Mc-
Kinley man and McKinley is going to
carry things by an overwhelming majority.
"It is just according to the man you
meet," said Mr. Holladay. "You can get
a majority any way you want it. For my
part, I am satisfied that times will be bet
ter no matter who is elected. This condi
tion oi things cannot continue as it is.
Whoever is elected will have to get in and
have some laws passed that will set to
work the idle men that are now to be seen
in all the towns of the country.
"In Portland we have these men, as you
have here, plenty of th^m, with nothing
to do. This free silver idea, however,
there is nothing in that, do you think so?
That's all been exploded long ago. But
there is one thing sure, something is
wrong when we see all these people who
want work and can't get any. Where is
Joseph Holladay, the "Wealthy
Oregonian, a Brother of the
Founder of the Pony Express.
[Sketched from, life by a " Call " artist.]
the trouble? Farmers have got lots to
sell, it's so in Oregon, but they can't get
anything for what they have got. Thera
iÂ» no prices.
"I have just come up from Los Angeles.
That town is re<l-hot on politics. They
are discussing politics everywhere and
getting out and mating speeches on the
streets, and in the parKs you will see men
with crowds around them delivering ad
dresses. I don't think any man knows
how the country is going at all. If there
is anybody that does he's a long ways
smarter than I am. We are simply in the
dark md none of us will know till the
I votes are counted late on November 3."
The i mneror and the Artist.
The Emperor Francis Joseph recently
went unaccompanied to the studio of the
artist, Ludwig Bruck, in Budapest, in
order to sit for a portrait, which is to
adorn the ereat Council Hall of the Royal
Palace of Justice. During the hour and a
half which he passed with the Dainter he
spoke with much pleasure of the rapid
progress made with the portrait, which
represents him in the regalia of a Knight
of the Order of St. Stephen, and con*
versed also with great evident interest on
the questions which most engage the at
tention of the modern schools of art, such
as impressionism, symbolism and natural
ism.

DID THE COMPANY
USE ITS PULL?
Very Peculiar Case Heard
Before Commissioner
Heacock.
PROSECUTED BY FOOTE.
How the Southern Pacific Made
a Cat's Paw of the
Government
UNFOUNDED FORGERY CHARGE
G. H. Lawrence, Arrested in Ogden,
Gives Conclusive Proof of
Innocence.
From the Â«vidence introduced at the
preliminary hearing of G. H. Lawrence,
charged with forgery, before Commis
sioner fleacock yesterday, it appeared
that the Southern Pacific was outraging
the feelings and jeopardizing the life of
one roan in oraer to get back at another.
The court evidently entertained the same
opinion, for tbe case was dismissed and a
tevere rebuke administered to those who
had a hand in tbe business.
Probably tbe worst feature of the case,
however, is found in the reports current
about the Federal building that the rail
road used the Federal Government through
District Attorney Foote to pull its dis
agreeable chestnuts from the fire. Mr.
Foote fought valiantly for the cause he
represented, but Commissioner Heacock
would have none of it, and so informed
the Government's chief prosecuting offi
cer.
The facts in the case, from the evidence
introduced, may be briefly stated as fol
lows: Ten days ago Lawrence bought of
Conklin & Co., scalpers, an order in four
parts, calling for a ticket from Oakland
Mole to Chicago, via the Southern Pacific
lines. The order was in the name of oiie
Parker Bray, a pensioner, and had been
issued by local Quartermaster Lee.
Lawrence was informed by the brokers
that he had a perfect right to sign Bray's
name as the latter had given them (Conk
lin & Co.) such authority in the shape of
a power of attorney. Acting on this as
surance he purchased the order, effectine
a saving of $12 50. Lawrence then visited
the Southern Pacific ticket office, pre
sented the order and after some short de
lay was furnisi-.ed a ticket. The next
morning he started on the long, journey,
all going well untill near Carlin, Nev.
The conductor demanded the ticket and
also full fare to Oeden. Lawrence gave up
the one and paid the other. On arriving
in Ogden he was tafcen in custody by a
United States Marshal, who informed him
that he was wanted in San Francisco for
forging the name of Parker Bray to a Gov
ernment order calling for a ticket to Chi
cago. This telegram had been sent by
District Attorney Foote.
Lawrence protested his innocence, but
declared his perfect willingness to return
to San Francisco and face his accusers,
and that, too, without a requisition.
These facts and others were brought out
at the hearing, the principal contention,
however, being that Lawrence had a per
fect right to sign Bray's name to the
order. It was also shown that the Gov
ernment had not lost a dollar, nor had>
there ever been any chance of such a
thing.
The complaint on which Lawrence was
tried for forgery was made out by one
Adams, an employe of the Southern Pacific,
and hence did not come in the jurisdiction
of Federal authorities. The interest Dis
trict Attorney Foote took in the case,
therefore, was not generally understood,
the result being that many unkind things
about the Judge were whispered around
the corridors of the big Appraiser's build
ing.
While Lawrence was on the stand he
became great affected in reciting the in
dignities to which he had been subjected.
At the conclusion of the hearing the court
officers, with one single exception, crowded
about him, offering congratulations and
sympathy. The railroad had a special
officer in citizen's clothes on hand to ar
rest Lawrence should he be turned loose,
but after hearing the evidence they
determined to give him no more trouble.
Mr. Lawrence has been dangerously sick
for a long time and his physician stated
yesterday that it was providential death
had not resulted from the excitement to
which he had been subjected. It is un
derstood that Lawrence will immediately
institute suic for damages against the rail
road and probably a Government official
or so.
THE POLICE ON PARADE
Fifteen Companies Inspected on
Van Ness Avenue by
Chief Crowley.
They Are Pat Throurh Various Evo-
Inlions, and March With Re
markable Steadiness.
Fifteen companies oi the police mus
tered on Van Ness avenue yesterday aft
ernoon for inspection by Chief Crowley,
preparatory to the great parade of the en
tire department on October 7.
Each company consisted of 25 men, mak
ing 375 altogether in the ranks, and each
was in command of an officer. The com
panies were divided into two battalions,
the first composed of eight companies
from Captain Wittman's district, and the
second composed of seven companies,
four from Captain Spillane's district, two
from Captain Gillen's district and one
from Captain Dunlevy's district. Each bat
talion was headed by two rifle companies.
Chief Crowley was in command of the
two battalions, and had as his aid-de
camp Drill Instructor Marshall. They
were both mounted, and the veteran
Chief's manly figure looked to perfection
as he sat firmly on his seat and rode along
the lines with a pleased lootc on his face.
Captain W.utman acted as major.
The battalions were first drawn up in
line, the first extending from Market
street to Hayes and the second from
Hayes to Fulton. They were then put
through various evolutions, including
marching in column of companies, col
umns of platoons and in lours. They
marched with remarkable steadiness con
sidering the fact that there was no music
to guide them.
Two Sharper* Arrested.
William Goldsmith and George Hlnes were
arrested yesterday morning by Policeman
Georjre Rlortlan and locked up In "the tank-"
at the City Prison. They passed a confederate
bill on the proprietor of a lodging-house,
Magon and Post streets, receiving a .fo gold
piece as change, after presumably paying $o
>or rooms they engaeed. Tbe police believe
that Goldsmith and Hines are the two men
who have been victimizing numerous hotel
keepers and boarding-housekeepers in tne
same way.
HIGH EXPLOSIVES USED.
Quarrymen on Bluerock Hill Send
Showers of Flying Itock Against
Dwellings.
The quarrymen who are engaged in cut
ting through the bluerock hill on Ken
tucky street have been using explosives of
such high grade that when the blasts are
let off fragments of rock are sent flying
through the air in such reckless fashion
as to injure property and endanger human
life.
On one occasion recently an unusually
heavy charge was let off and it threw frag
ments of rock against houses situate over
1000 yards away. A number of windows
were broken. On another occasion a rock
weighing twelve pounds was sent over a
spur of the bill and across Kentucky to
Napa street.
The neighbors do not object to tbe blast
ing, but they would recommend that less
powder be used.
OLYMPIC CLUB BANQUET.
The Advisory Committee Enjoy a Pleas
ant Feast, at Cafe Norman.
The advisory election committee of the
Olympic Club of '95-96 held a pleasant re
union and banquet at Cafe Norman on
Tuesday evening. Among those present
were: F. H. Kerrigau (chairman), E. P.
McLennan (vice-chairman), H. C. Massie,
E. Unger, 6. V. Casady, H. 8. Jerome, W.
W. Coates, C. A. Reynolds, J. A. Mallon,
C. M. Gunn, F. J. Devlin, I. Deutscn, J.
F. Coffey. F. R. Butz, Oscar A. Tolle and
J. X. de Witt.
The speakers of the evening were : F. H.
Kerrigan, E. P. McLennan, F. R. Butz, C.
Reynolds and J. A. Mallon, all of whom
favored the cutting down of expenses of
the club as far as expedient. Boxing,
football, handball and cycling the speakers
thovght should be encouraged, as they
formed the principal fields of sport.
REPORTS ARE WITHHELD
Commissioner Stanton on the
Trail of Recalcitrant
Railroads.
He Introdnced a Motion Aimed at the
Officials of the Southern Pacific
Company.
Owing to the failure of the Attorney-
General to reply to the communication of
the Railroad Commissioners, recently ad
dressed to him. concerning the jurisdic
tion of the commission over street rail
roads, the alleged contempt of Secretary
Willcutt of the Market-street Railway
Company, the question of bicycles as bag
gage and the recalcitrancy of the steam
ship companies which failed to submit
reports to the committee, those subjects
were not taken up for consideration by
the commission at its session yesterday.
But in order apparently that the com
mission might not be accused of failing to
earn its salary another move was made
directed against the Southern Pacific Com
pany, though ostensibly against a number
cf minor roads which had failed to
send reports to tbe board.
These reports should now be in the
hands of the State Printer, so that they
mipht be incorporated in the annual re
port of the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners, which is usually submitted to the
Governor at the beginning of each year.
Ever since the institution of the suit by
the Southern Pacific Company against the
commission in the United States Circuit
Court to prevent a reduction in freight
rates, the great corporation, acting in con
formity with the claim set up in its com
plaint that the commission is an uncon
stitutional creation, has ignored that
body.
It has persistently refrained from filing
with the cpmmission the new schedulesof
fares and freights it has made, and now
refuses to submit a report of its opera
tions for the past year, as it had previ
ously been in the habit of doing ever
since the organization of the commission.
President La Rue was not present at the
session of the commission yesterday, owing
to illness, and Commissioner Clark occu
pied the chair. After a number of com
munications of no general interest had
been read by Secretary Newman and or
dered placed on file, Commissioner Stan
ton moved that the secretary be instructed
to write to all the companies that cad
failed to 'file reports with the commission,
informing them that unless tUese reports
were forwarded within ten days the mat
ter would be placed in the hands cf the
attorney for action. Subc-nas will first
be issued, citing the officials of the defiant
companies to appear and produce their
books, and should these fail to be effective,
the Attorney-General will be asked to take
the proper legal steps to compel compli
ance with the order of the board. The
motion was duly adopted.

FOLSOM GRANITE
WILL BE USED
Convict Labor Stone for
the Affiliated
Colleges.
SO SAYS JAMES EAE.
Contractors Think That the
Trade Unions Will Make
Protest
CONTRACT HAS BEEN SIGNED.
Claim Made That the Terms Upon
Which Bids Were Based Were
Not Understood.
The buildings of the Affiliated Colleges
will be constructed of J?'olsom granite,
quarried by convicts. James Rae, of the
Rae Building Company, said yesterday
that this is the fact. The contract for the
mason work went to the Rae Building
Company, whose bid for the granite work
was $143,500. This announcement will
occasion lively in ierest among the mem
bers of the trade unions and not less
among those who bid unsuccessfully for
the masonry contract. It is also probabie
that the stone will be cut at Folsom, but
Mr. Rae said that this had not been
decided upon. The general belief among
contractors is that this course will be pur
sued. The contract was awarded some
time ago, but was not signed until last
week.
Already the subject of convict-quarried
Btone has caused a Btir in various quarters.
This has been on the increase ever since
the bids were opened, when it was found
that the Rae Building Company had not
only underbid competitors to the amount
of several thousand dollars for the cranite
work, but had actually bid less for granite
than for sandstone.
The bids for the granite work were as
follows: J. F. Riley, $148,480; R- Ring
rose, $149,250; T. W. Butcher, $170,900; C.
Ferris, $167,597; T. Butler, $158,650; M.
McGowan, $163,000; R>chardnon <fe Ciale,
$178,000; R. Mitchell, $170,000; J. Wagner,
$179,000; Rae Bunding Company, $143,500.
This was $15,000 lower tlian any other div
for the same work. The Rae Building
Company's bid for sandstone was $145,300,
or $1800 biaher than for granite.
Tbia iact naturally caused much surprise
among the competing bidders, for granite
is more expensive than sandstone. Tiie
bidders at once jumpe-l to the conclusion
that this meant that con victpranite would
be the building stone, and this is now con
firmed by a member of the successful firm.
Allegations are already made by contract
ors that their understanding was that the
Folsom granite would not be used, aiut
that consequently their bids were offered
under a misapprehension. The advertise
ment for bids made no specification con
cerning the source from which the build
ing stone should be procured.
When James Rae was asked yesterday
whether it is true that tbe bid of the con
cern was based upon Folsom granite and
if that material will be used in the Affil
aied Colleges, he promptly said "Yes."
Then he made another statement. "The
State," said Mr. Rae, "is privileged to use
its own material in constructing the State
buildings. It would not have been possi
ble to construct the colleges of granite in
side of the contract price of $250,000 on any
other sort of an understanding. There was
no concealment of our purpose to use Fol
som granite. Three or four others men
tioned Folsom granite in connection with
their bids. One of these concerns was
Miller & Beck. I do not recollect the
others. We are going to use the Folsom
rranite. Whether or not it will be cut in
Folsom has not been decided."
The matter was discussed with contrac
tors at the Builders' Exchange yesterday.
A representative of a large stone concern
: aid that contractors had feared that the
use of convict granite would have in
volved them in trouble with trade unions,
and so bad not bid on that basis. One
contractor said be was asked by the archi
tects, when the bids were opened, how
much less he would make the bid with the
understanding that he would use Folsom
convict granite, and he had replied that
the difference would be from $12,000 to
$15,000. The contractors whose figures
were comparatively low are not satisfied
with the result.
One cause alleged for dissatisfaction is
that the Rae BuQdin- Company is really
McCann, whose connection with work on
the City Hall will be remembered. But
this is vigorously denied by Mr. Rae, who
says that McCann has no connection with
the company in any capacity other than
as a stockholder, and that be will have
nothing to do with the direction of the
work upon the Affiliated Colleges.
The architects who prepared the specifi
cations for bidders are J. Â£. Kraft and
Mertens & Coffey in the Academy of Sci
ences building. Mr. Kraft said yesterday
that be had supposed the idea that Fol
som convict granite might be used was
commonly entertained prior to the open
ing of the bids. The entire subject was
discussed openly and was publicly re
ported in the daily papers something like
one year ago Alien the Board of Regents
of the university had the plans for the
Affiliated Colleges under consideration.
Mr. Kraft also said there was nothing in
the advertisement calling for bids which
gave out any hint or information that
couid lead any one to suppose that Folsom
granite was barred. The estimates upon
one set of designs that were submitted to
the Board of Regents were oppnly based
?jpon the Folsom granite proposition.
One contractor said that Governor Bndd
hud told him he favored the use of the
Folsom granite in the Affiliated Colleges.

IT MEANS $400,000 A YEAR
TO MR. HEARST.
Substantial Reasons % for Advocating
Free Coinage.
The Value of the Output of the Ontario Alone
Would Leap From $10,000 to
$75,000 a Month.
If Mr. Bryan is elected President of the United State", and the free coinage of sil
ver is adopted as the policy of the Government, and if such policy has the effect of
enhancing the price of silver, as the champions of that policy say it will, then the
success of Mr. Bryan will be worth to William R. Hearst, proprietor of the Examiner
and of the New York Journal, not less than $400,000 a year. This is the estimate
placed on Mr. Hearst's "winnings," as they say, on the appreciation of the value of
the product of his silver mines.
Mr. Hearst owns a third of thÂ« stock of the Ontario Mining Company, 82,281
shares, appraised at the time of his father's death as worth $1,226,678. He owns of the
Daly Mining Company stock 27,633 1-5 shares, appraised at the same time as worth
$525,030 80.
The Daly mine is a sister vein of the Ontario mineâ practically the same mine.
The Ontario mine is rated am">ng mining properties as jnst the best silver mine in the
long list of silver mines in this country, if not in the world. It has paid in dividends
alon<* no less than $9,000,000. When the price of silver was at its best the Ontario
mine was yielding to its stockholders $75,000 a month. It Is now yielding but $10,000
a month. That is to say, the value of the productâ not the quantityâ has depreciated
to less than one-seventh what it was when the price of silver was up.
The whole argument of the fr^e-silver men is that the free and unlimited coinage
of silver at 16 to 1 would not only lift to but would maintain the price of, silver at that
ratio to gold. That is to say, it would cause silver to be worth $1 29 an ounce, and the
product of the Ontario mine would leap from $10,000 a month to $75,000 in net value.
"To account for this difference in the value of the product, as compared with the
anticipated advance in the price of silver, it must be remembered that the expenses of
worKine the mine remain the same, whether the price is up or down." said a gentleman
who is big in mining affairs, but, being a Democrat and on friendly terms with the
proprietor of the Examiner, would not permit the printing of his name. "The fact is
that if silver were to go up to $1 29 it would be worth just $65,000 a month, or $780,000 a
year, to the stockholders of the Ontario mine. As Mr. Hearst owns a third of the stock
of that mine you can figure out his share yourself. It would be $260,000â it would be
worth that much more, you understand, than he is getting out of the property now.
The same increase in values would result on the Daly mine, which, as X say. is a sister
vein equally rich, and of which Mr. Hearst owns considerably over $500,000 worth of
stock.
"Of other silver minrne stock he owns what would be to another man a fortune
but which in the presence of these big properties is scarcely worth mentioning. In
round figures the advance in the price of silver that tne free-coinage men predict as
the result of free and unlimited coinage would net Mr. Hearst a cool $400,000 a year
over and above his present revenues."
Mr. Hearst is the owner of the only paper in Ban Francisco that advocates this
free coinage. He is the owner of the only paper ln New York City that advocates it.
They have botb been advocating it loudly and clamorously. The facts here set forth
may assist its readers in understanding why they advocate it.
The Examiner yesterday published what is called "An answer" to Tint Call's
presentation of the appraisement of the Hearst estate and of the mining stock listed
as a part of it. The answer is nothing more than a painful champing and frothing
and crying of "liar," strong in evidence of how the exposition toucoed Mr. Hearst.
The fact is that it cut the silver champion both ways. It was an Irrefutable showing
rf his immense personal monetary interest in tne success of Bryan and free coinage.
But, on the other hand, as to the wealth of Mr. Hearst, it did not show enougn. Here
was a most embarrassing situation. Its millions in silver mines, sucn as must surely
dazÂ« the mind of the workingman, in whose behalf Mr. Hearst was making bis daily
plea for more and cheaper money, was still far short of what Mr. Hearst's new mil
lionaire acquaintances in New York had a right to expect
When Mr. Hearst made his recent advent into New York he was made the subject
of a long article at $2 per line in the Fourth Estate, a journal devoted to newspaper
men. It was illustrated with his picture in half tone. In that article, the data of
which was secured from Mr. Hearst himself of course, the Hearst estate was said to
be worth $27,000,000. It was, therefore, very embarrassing to have that appraisement,
aÂ« carefully copied from the document itself in the County Clerk's office, printed in
black type in a newspaper in this City and in New York.
In this dilemma â the necessity of appearing poorer to the poor than the facts
would allow and of appearing richer to the richâ Mr. Hearst saw no other way than
to jump up and down in a passion and cry out, "Liiar!" The Examiner takes great
pains to explain that the Anr conda mine, scheduled in the appraisement at $3,600,000,
had since been sold for $7,500,000. Very well. The Call mentioned particularly that
the Anaconda mine had been sold, but not knowing the figures did not state them
Mr. Hearst is here given the benefit of the $7,soo.oooâ taking his own word for the
amount.
According to Mr. Hearst's statement the Anaconda mine was appraised at about
half its value. If, as it is fair to presume, his silver mines, the Ontario and Daly, were
also appraised at half their value, this advocate of free coinage owns silver stuck
valued at $3,000,000. This being the case, Mr. Hearst will have no difficulty in cou
vincing any one in a lunatic asylum that he is an unselfish apostle of free coinage.
However, he does not deny the ownership of three silver mines. In view of the
general and indefinite cry of liar The Call has taken the pains to make a fac-simile of
the appraisement of the mining stock, as it is on file in the County Clerk's office, and
also presents Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst's affidavit as to its correctness.

FOR THE HOMELESS BOYS
The Grand Festival of the
Youths' Directory Will
Open To-Night
Armory Hall a Scene of Color and
Beautyâ Contests for Popu
larity.
The grand festival in aid of the Youths'
Directory will open this evening in Armory
Hall, on Market street, near Tenth. For
some time the committee of charitable
ladies have been laboring assiduously col
lecting donations and enlisting the sym
pathies and services of all kindly disposed
toward the homeless boys cared for at the
institution, and now they are ready to
launch the festival before the public.
The great hall of the armory will oe sec
tioned off into pretty booths, from which
fairy places the ladies will dispose of the
articles which have been donated or pur
chased. There will be refreshments and
also an entertaining musical programme
each evening, varied with addresses from
well-known speakers.
The San Francisco Letter-carriers' band
has volunteered to give a concert on one
evening and on another the band of the
Hebrew Orphan Asylum will play.
Several fine orchestras will participate.
The principal feature will be a voting
contest in which a prize of a gold watch
will be given to the most popular police
captain. The voting is now going on at
Raphael's store.
The other contest will also be a gold
watch to the most popular letter-carrier,
the Toting now going on at the postoffice
stations of the City. Another contest will
be for the World's Fair drum, donated by
Captain Jerome Deasy, to be given to the
best drilled League of the Cross company.
For the opening Chairman James R.
Kelly will introduce the Very Reverend
Father Prendergast, who, in the absence
of Archbishop Riordan, will declare the
festival under way. The musical pro
gramme will consist of bolos by Miss
Catherine Black, Miss N. C. Kirby, G. V.
Woods, Mr. Berger. There wiil be a read
ing by Miss Anna Daly. Mrs. Paul B.
Hay will accompany the singers.
'J he tickets for single admission are 25
cents, and season tickets good for the en
tire term will be sold for $L
THE FIGHT WILL BE HERE.
Corbett and Sharkey to Â£n e n C Â« Before
the National Club.
In regard to thÂ« Corbett-Sharkey
comedy, now being played on this conti
nent, Manager Groom of the National
Club sai i yesterday:
'There seems to be an impression
among some people that the match is not
settled. We deem that, when we have ac
cepted Mr. Corbeti's offer of putting up
the $10,000. the match is fixed, be
cause w.- are not asking anything that he
did not volunteer io do himself.
."So far as the contest la concerned it
will be und(.r the sole management of the
Rational Club, the refeiee to bÂ« selected
by the club without any reference to the
principals- whatever. We have deter
mined that a determined referee of un
questioned integrity shall be selected.
Ihis will obviate all chances of a pre
arranged agreement on the part of the
pugilists.
â¢The articles of agreement declare in
unmistakable terms that ciinchintr, foul
ing or wrestling are prohibited. This will
insure fair fighting. To protect the club
against any accident we have arranged
that the principals shall be examined "by
a physician and pronounced in good con
dition before entering the rng.
"Dr. Lustig nas been appointed the offi
cial medical examiner of the Na:ional
Ciub. ho man likely to suffer serious
physical injury from a blow will be per
mitied to enter the ropes."
Certain representative citizens, who de.
sire for obvious reasons that tneir names
he withiteid, held a conference with Messrs.
Gibbs and Groom a short time ago, and
stated that they were willing to put up
any bond, note or other security demanded
by Corbett ana Sharkey.
As Corbett in a telegram yesterday
stated that he would accept nothing but a
cash deposit, another conference was held
last night, and the same gentlemen agreed
to put up a cash deposit for the National
Club. They objected to this until it was
regarded as unavoidable, because they did
not want so large a sum of money to re
main idle for at least three months.
So it seems that San Francisco will get
the ficut after all.
THE WORLD'S GOLD.
J. J. Dwyer Addresund a Full House
at the Metropolitan
Temple.
A good audience greeted J. J. Dwyer at
Metropolitan Temple last evening when
he appeared upon the platform, intro
duced by Chairman M. A. Hurley. A
goodly company of vice-presidents of the
meeting also occupied tne stage.
The speaker in his advocacy of free
silver coinage held that there was not gold
enough in the world for the needs of its
business. Of the $4,000,000,000 in use Eng
land, France and Germany possessed one
half and the former country hsd a con
trolling interest in the other half.
There was only $600,000,000 in this
coun , try, and that was not enough for trade.
Millions, he said, were hoarded in Europe
against the time when the inevitable war
between those threatening kingdoms
breaks out, and $1,000,000,000 is held tied
up here.
80 the Rothchilds, he said, with their
agents, the Morcans, the Belmonts et al.
have their grip on the gold of the world.
This country is groaning under the bond
issue, and to maintain the gold standard
there must be more bonds issued. There
is no other way. The gold bug wants an
honest dollar, and the dollar he wants is a
dollar that will hatcn other dollars while
he sleeps.
The speaker read several published ex
tracts on the subject, and quoted Webster
and Blame as advocating bimetallism.
He also scored Bourke Cockran. He was
interrupted frequently w>th applause, but
on the whole the audience took the speech
quite quietly.
SOLD BY THE SHERIFF.
The Ending of an Opposition Telephone
Company at Topeka, Kans.
On September 19 Sheriff Kepley sold
under an execution the laree opposition
telephone system of the Harrison Te.e
phone and Electric Company at Topeka,
Kans. The company was backe 1 entirely
by local capital and has been operating
for about a year, thÂ«Â» rates for service beiuc
less than the established Bell Company.
Although the Harrison Company had
connections to Holton.Circleville, Elmont,
Hoitt, Mayetta and Soldier, all by lone
uistance lines and equipped with lons
distance telephones, the public support,
which was at first almost unanimous, was
gradually withdrawn until the enterprise
ceased t3 be self-support-ng.
The judgments against the property
amounted to $32,500, and the plant was
sold to the Missouri aud Kansas Tele
phone Company of the Bell system for
$8000. The Harrison investors lost about
$40,000 on the experiment.
