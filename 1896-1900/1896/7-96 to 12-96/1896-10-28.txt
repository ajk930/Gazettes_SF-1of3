LOS ANGELES GREETS
MAINE'S FAVORITE SON
Fifty Thousand Califor
nians Addressed by
Speaker Reed.
Greatest Political Demonstration
in the History of the
Golden West.
PARADE OF REPUBLICAN LEGIONS.
With Convincing Logic the Statesman From
the East Appeals to the Intelligence
of the West.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 27.â When
â¢ the train bearing Thomas B. Reed of
Maine entered California through its
southern gate this morning the snow was !
falling in his Eastern home and the cold
breezes from Lakes Erie and Michigan
were chilling the marrow of the residents
of Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland. It
was raining on the sand and sagebrush
that skirt the oranee land, but as the day
wore on the dirty clouds became white
Bnd rolled toward the horizon, leaving j
. bare a sky of purest, deepest blue, such as j
that against which the white marble
temples of old Greece stood up, or such as i
shine in Egypt land before the stars come j
out at even to make the somber showows
' of the pyramids more sacred and more
mysterious.
Mr. Reed stood upon the rear platform
' of his car and glanced upon the sandy
plain cf cactus and sagebrush, relieved
'.' here and there by clumps of the yucca
palm and the dried stalks of the Spanish
bayonet. Beyond him arose the brown,
bare mountains, the farthest deepening
into smoky hue, their tops tipped with
the first snows of the year. He took a full
breath of the cooJ, light air and smiled.
.It did him goea. Mr. Reed is a large con -
turner of California air, tor he is a big
man â over six feet tall and 250 pounds in
weigct, with shoulders, chest and lungs
to mateh â and he muttered, "What a
differenci; what a difference."' Then he
took another full breath and remarked
that the air of Caliiornia always made him
feel so much better.
The statesman from Maine is a large
' man, mentally, physically and morally.
He is one of those rare men who loom up
. against you with the suddenness and tne
terrifying ponderosity of an Atlantic
1 :.er in a fog. You lose your presence of
â¢ mind, and no matter how captious you
may be, you first skip out of the way and
you protest as well as you can in the big
wake he leaves behind him in the water.
When you see him and hear him speak
you do not wonder that the crushed
tragedians of the Democratic opera bouffe
called him "Czar" Reed. Yet all that he
did to deserve that title was to rule that
a Democrat present in the flesh in the
House of Congress and visible to the eye
of the Speaker, with ail his sins and im
perfections, was also present politically
and as such should be marked on the roll
call.
Mr. Reed does not wtar wnisker*. If he
did he would look too much like a Popu
list. He has a full, round, big face with
. fat cheek?, a double chin and thick eye
lids. It is the frame and countenance of
joliy Friar Tuck, and, to tell the troth,
the big man from Maine is as jolly as any
friar dare be, even in the olden times
when a laugh and a joke were not con
sidered sins.
There was nothing in the landscape par
t'cularly to enliven a man until in the full
glory of the warm sunshine the orange
groves and vineyards on the outskirts of
: Los Angeles were reached. The orange
groves were the subject of Mr. Reed's at
â¢ tention, with here and there a field of
rreen alfalfa so refreshing to the eye.
Here and there in front of a humble farm
- house was something red as dame waving
'. in the breeze, and as the eye cot properly
focused upon it it resolved' itself into the
stars and stripes, waving to do honor to
the visiting statesman from Maine.
Judge Enoch Knight, a sound-money
' Democrat, formerly of Maine and now of
Los Angeles, was wailing at the southern
gates ot the State with the corumittce on
reception. He is an old friend of Mr.
Heed and was cordially greeted by the big
man. Mr. Knight is going to vote for Mc-
Kinley, and he asked Mr. Reed what he
thought of the prospects froÂ»n his own ob
servations. Mr. Reed said that he had
the utmost confidence in the election of
â¢Major McKiniey. The frea-silvfr men in
the Republican party would be more than
offset by the sound-money men in the
ranks oi the Democratic party.
While be admitted that there were a
great many unknown qualities in the con- j
test, he could ngt find room for any doubt
as to the general result, from the fact
mat the business men and all other con
servative citizens had taken hold of the
matter in earnest, reahiinjr. fully the im
portance of the coming election, and tnat
ciass of citizens bad never yet failed to
carry ar. election, he said. The election of
Garfield was due to the efforts of the
_ business men of the country, ami they did
not make 3ny mistake when they sup
. ported him. The sober second thought of
kthe Â«ountry had been awakened to the
â emergency and was assertim- itself. He
\ad found that almost all the business
lA ii of the country were forsound money.
Tue parade to greet Mr. Reed was one
' of the longest ever held in Los Angeles.
It seems as though the whole country had
poured into Los Angeles city to see him.
The sidewalks and streets were impass
able and the orange colored ribbon with
The San Francisco Call
the motto, "I am for sonnd money," vas
seen everywhere on the coat lapels of the
men and tne bosoms of the ladies. In the
case of the fairer sex the ribbon was sup
plemented wfth the golden chrysanthe
mum, just as if the whole country were
giving a yellow tea party.
Fifty thousand people would not be too
large an estimate of the crowd that tried
to get into the park to hear Mr. Reed this
afternoon. This crowd was swelled by a
train of twelve cars from San Francisco
and way stations, on board of which were
Charles M. Shortridge, Senator E:i Den
ison, Mr. Crothers of the Bulletin and
others on the way to greet Mr. Reed, but
the train had been delayed three hours at
Tracy last night and did not reach Los
Angeles until 3:30 o'clock this afternoon,
by which time the waole affair was over.
The orange counties turned out right
loyally to greet Mr. Reed. Delegations

a glad smile and sent her children thither
with the kiss of welcome, and from the !
polden mines and cactus fields of San !

loyal men to cheer the patriot, on his way.
It was not a sectional greeting, but the
hand of all Southern California was ex
tended to the statosman from the East.
It was a cordial, warm-hearted reception,
one not lightly to be received nor easily to
be forgotten.
Thomas Fitch, the silver-tongued, called
upon Mr. Reed at the Westminster shortly
after the meeting. He arrived from the
East about two weeks ago after a cam
paigning tour in Michigan, Oiiio, Illinois,
New York and Missouri. Before coming
here he made a speech in his present
homeâ Arizona. There the Republicans
are united for sound money and tho Demo

are a meager resource with which to por

of banners and the transparencies with
appropriate and skillfully devised mottoes,

whole was resplendent with a thousand

the State much of its renown as well as its
wealth.

TWO BANDITS STOP BULLETS.
The Desperadoes in Retreat Toward

ALBUQUERQUE, N. Mex., Oct. 27.â
A dispatch receivea here from Fort Stun
ton late this afternoon says that members
of a hunting party which passed the post
a few hours before stated that they learned
from a ranchman with whom they camped
last night, about thirty miies northeast of
the fort, that one of the posses in pursuit
of the outlaws who held up the San Anto
nio-White Oaks stages a few days ago had
come up to them and that a pitclied battle
had ensued. Forty or fifty shots were ex
changed. One of the officers was killed
outright and another is thought to be
mortally wounded.
There were four men in the party of
bandits. One was shot through the body
and is believed to bo mortally wounded.
He dropped his gun and rode off to the
rear, stooping in his saddle as though un
able to sit upright. Another was shot
through the right arm or hand and was
unable to use his gun.
The gang retreated, going southward.
Owing to the fact that they could not
leave their wounded and dead to the
coyotes the officers were unable to follow
the robbers, but were making their way
back to thp settlements.
The portion of the country in which
these pangs are operating is the wildest
part of the Southwest, taking in all the
dreaded Malpai country east of the Jar
nado del Muerta, and covering a section
100 miies east and west by 190 miles north
and south, settled only by a few cattle
men, whose ranches are usually forty or
fifty miles apart. This is what renders
pursuit of the bandits so very difficult.
The officers have no way of obtaining pro
visions or animals except such as they
take with them, while the bandits forage
on the country, killing cattle when they
need meat and taking provisions and
horses from every ranchhouse they come
to. United States Marshal Hall, Sheriff
Bursum of Socorro County, and Postorh'ce
Inspector Fredricks are all on the trail
with different posses, but it cannot be de
termined from the report received to-day
which of the posses had the engagement
with the bandits, or who the officers were
who are reported killed or wounded.
Pat Garrett, the famous Lincoln County
Sheriff who ran down and captured Billy
the Kid not far from where the.-c outlaws
are operating, has organized a posse and
left Los Cruces two days ago to take the
trail. He goes well armed and well pro
visionsd and intends to stay with them.
It ia believed that the robbers are now
making for Old Mexico and Garrett 'is
heading for the border to cut them off.
Deputy Marshal Loomis arrived from
CONGRESSMAN JAMES McLACHLAN, Chairman of the Great
Meeting; on "Tom Reed Day " at Los Angeles*
Juarez this evening, but was unable to
give any additional particulars of the pur
suit, except that the Mexican border for
more than 100 miles ia now so thoroughly
guarded that it will be impossible for the
bandits to get out of the country. He had
nothing additional in regard to the fight
with the bandits.
BRUTALITY OF ROBBERS,
At a Possible Cost of Two Lives
Four Masked Men Make a
Big Haul.
A Hotel-Keeper and Wife Are Sand*
bagged anJ R? leved of About
$5000
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 27.â A Herald
special from Shamokin, Pa., says: At a
possible cost of two lives four robbers on
Sunday mornine stole $5000 from Mr. and
Mrs. Anthony Monagiian, in the mining
village of Rappahannock. The heads of
Mr. and Mrs. Monnghan were crushed with
sandbags. Last nieht they were in a
critical condition, and it was not expected
they would live until morning. The rob
bers are still at large, but partiej of men
are scouring the mountains on each side
of the village in search of them.
The Monaghans are the owners of the j
Rappahannocfc Hotel. They did not i
maintain a large bank account, but it was
generally believed tnat a large sum of
money was hidden in the hotel. There
were no guests in the hotel Saturday night.
The Monaghans were alone.
The burglars gained entrance to the ho- 1
Tel by climbing on the roof, forcing the
second-story shutter with "jimmies" and
then making their way to the room where
the old couple slept. There were four of
the robbers and all were masked. The
curtains were drawn, and the leader
coolly told one of the burglars to light a
lamp so they could locate the money sup
posed to be in the house.
"Now," cried the leader to the trem
bling hotel-keeper,"we want all the money
there is in this ranch. Don't speak above
a whisper or we will kill you." Monaghan
replied that lie was poor and bad nothing
more to give than already stated.
â¢'Take that," the leader answered, and
down came a sandbag unon the head of
the landlord. Mrs. Monr.ghnn shrieked
and tried to leap from the bed to rush
for a window and call for help. She was
knocked down by the burglar.
During the attack Mrs. Monaghan re
vived, and although half dead from her
wounds, cried to the men to have mercy.
A brutal kick in her' face was the reply.
The open door of the saloon attracted at
tention in the morning, and an investiga
tion led to the finding of man and wife,
still insensible. Yesterday afternoon it
was learned that the amount of money
stolen was $5000.
FirÂ« la nd to lit Sold.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 27.â The prop
erty known as Fire Island, in the bay,
will be sold at public auction at 71 Broad
way to-day. Fire Island was bought by
tr>e State of New York from David S.
Samnis in May, 1893. when the cholera
scare obtained a foothold in this country,
for a quarantine station. It cost a quarter
of a million dollars.
Since tho cholera scare the State has
had no use for the island, and efforts to
rent it out for hotel purposes have not
been particularly profitable. The com
missioners do not expect to get back any
thing like the figure paid for the property,
but will let it go if auytning over $100,000
is offered.

SIGNS FOR
TOM REED
The Giant Parade Points to
McKinley's Victory-
Day by Day.
CROWDS WANT TO JOIN
THE LINES.
Committees Are Encouraged
Among All Classes of
the People.
BOURBON LIES OF COERCION
SET AT REST.
None Except Friends of Sound Mon?y
â¢ and Protection Are Wanted
in the Ranks.
Yesterday was one of the most encourag
ing days yet seen in the work of organiz
ing the great parade for Saturday, and
there is now no doubt that more men will
be in line than were ever seen in any pro
cession in the great West.
The significant and beautiful feature of
the great demonstration is tnat it is vol
untary in every phase. At every meeting
of the general committee and of the many
sub-committees it has been laid down that
no man is desired in line unless he volun
tarily wears a McKiniey button and in
tends to vote for protection, prosperity
and sound money.
The spirit of the movement was fully
voiced by Oscar Lewis at the headquarters,
24 Fourth street, last night, when he an
nounced flatly that no Democrats or
Populists were wanted in lino and that it
was an insult to freemen to insinuate that
coercion was being attempted or could be
effected.
The sentiment was loudly applauded by
more than a hundred delegates represent
ing almost every hue of business and in-,
dustry in the City.
Leaders of the parade movement were
wrotn at the Democratic press and Gov
ernor Budd yesterday for circulating the
story of coercion. Many comments were
heard to the effect that the' Governor's
utterances were demagogic.
AH day yesterday telegrams, telephone
messages and letters came to headquar
ters conveying the information that ad
jacent towns -are deeply in earnest and
that they mean to turn out as large a force
as possible to make the day one never to
be forgotten.
Colonel Stone again requests that every
organization intending to parade send in
names of marshals at once, that proper
arrangements for placing each body be
made.
The members of the National Republi
can League are requested to meet at 24
Fourth street at 1 p. m. on Saturday to
make final arrangements. Each member
will be furnished with one of the famous
McKiniey and Hobart protection um
brellas, which are neatly woven of the
National colors.
The press committee last night issued
the following official statement on the
progress of parade matters:
"Badges will be ready for distribution
Wednesday morning, October 28, at par
ade committee headquarters, 24 Fourth
street.
"All those intending to march in the
parade will be furnished the badge upon
application. Club and other organizations
are requested to procure the badges
through one of their officers.
"The parade committee wishes it under
stood that they are notengaeing any more
bands as they have already secured the re
quired number.
"The following have been appointed as
additional aids to the grand marshal;
George W. Brown, Marcus Harloe, W. G.
Jobson, Dan F. Crowiey, W. Ros3, C. B. F.
Lincoln, James Corlett, H. J. Burns, C. N.
Colby, F. H. Titus, John P. Fraser, Jacob
Salz, C. H. Depew. W. A. Haistead, Mil
ton M. -Davis, P. Bokeriza, E. tie la Torre
Jr., S. K. Thornton, M. F. Taylor.
"The following is the regalia for officers
of the parade: Grand marshal, cold sash;
chief of staff, red, white and blue sash;
aid to grand marshal, red sash; divisiou
marshals, blue and gold sash; division
bids, blue sash. Mounted officers are re
quested to wear dark coat, black slouch
hat, gauntlets and waist belt.
"AH aids are requested to call at head
quarters before purchasing regalia."
There was a largely attended and en
thusiastic meeting of the general com
mittee at 24 Fourth street last night, at
which there were many repoits of
prograss. Every committee from the
many branches of industry represented
had words of cheer, and it is apparent
that there will be fully 30,000 people in
line by 2 p. m. on Saturday.
H. A. Williams of the Fruit Exchange
reported that fifty-eight firms were repre
sented at a meeting yesterday and that
800 men are already enlisted to march.
"I am satisfied," said Mr. Williams,
â¢'that fully 2500 men in the fruit industry
will turn out in the parade."
The fruit men offered 250 decorated
wagons, but these the committee refused
on the ground that few wagons and car
riages are wanted, the procession being
almost wholly of men afoot.
General Sheehan reported the resigna
tion of William Ciuff as treasurer of the
parade committee. J. C. Currier was ap
pointed Treasurer Cluff's successor.
J. Carey Friedlander reported that 2500
closing notices are ready for distribution.
It is probable ihat Saturday afternoon will
be in the nature of a holiday and the
streets will have a gala appearance, for
many business houses will decorate.
â¢ A resolution was adopted requesting
business houses to close at noon on Satur
day, and that all employes, if they are Re
publicans or for sound money, be re
quested to parade.
Oscar Lewis took occasion at this junct2
ure to make a telling speech on the free
dom of employes. Among other things
he said :
"The slanderous reports of the .Bourbon
press about the coercion of American em
ployes are an insult to every American
employe. There is no coercion, and we
want, none but friends of sound money in
the parade. [Cheers and applause.] If
there is anything in human shape so con
temptible as to wear a ; McKinloy button
and parade when opposed to the things
McKinley stands for, then that low form
of humanity would probably be found in
such a party as Bryan represents." [Ap
plause.]
The association has one strong object
lesson that is a contradiction to the
slander that men are being coerced by L
their' employers. ;It has many applica
tions from the unemployed, who want to
march for a cause that promises to give
them work again, and the committee has
made arrangements to give the unem
ployed a prominent place and to furnish'
them officer?, flags and badges.
The furniture, upholstery and carpet in
' dustries will be largely represented in the
parade. They held a meeting yesterday,
and arranged for a union band of sixteen'
pieces, for 300 flags, a float and badges.
More than 300 will te in line.
The following are some of the additional
organizations that have reporred that
they will, participate in Saturday's great
m arch :
The BÂ»;ir Club, uniformed, 275 in
line.
' -Fire and Marine Insurance men, 250,
with United States First Infantry Band.
Leather-workers, tanners and boot
and shoe men, 750 strong.
The JloKinley Invincibles, 200, sixty
of whom will be uniformed. Baud.
Woman* Annex of the National Re
publican League, fifty, in carriages.
Oakland Republican Alliance, in uni
form, 100.
The Phoenix Club, 500 strong, band
and 70 men in uniform.
The Bedrock men, 30, with two four
horse teams.
The 'University of California Repab
. lican Club, 400. ,
The Tubbs Cordage Company, 400,
with floats.
United Railway Employes, 1000 men,
bauds and transparencies.
The Union Iron Works, 800 men, with
a float, " The Oregon," drawn by six
. horses.
â¢ The Wool Dealers and Handlers, 200,
with two four-horse floats.
The Winemakers' Association and the
Coopers' Guild, 700.
Carriages, about 75, at the end of the
parade.
The following organizations from San
Jose will participate:
> Santa Clara County Republican League,
80 strong, with a drum corps of IS.
, The Sound Mot L ague.
McKinley Labor Union.
Italian-American Republican League.
Afro-American Republican League.
It has been decided that all carriages!
will be placed at the very end of the
parade, the places of honor in every in
stance coing to those afoot.
;-â  Ail organizations in Oakland, Berkeley
and Alameda are requested to report at
once to L. L. Bromwell, 410 California
street, that there may be no delay in
making arrangements. , .
All the railroad and Eastern steamship
company agents in this City will turn out
and form a special division 100 stroi.g in
She great Republican daylight parade.
That was decided yesterday at a meeting
held in the rooms of the Traffic Associa
tion in the Mills building. A large repre
sentation was present, including officials
from all of the thirty or more agencies
here of Eastern railroad and Atlantic
steamship lines, exclusive of the Southern
Pacific, wnich will turn out a special divi
sion of its own. Â
"The decision was unanimous and spon
taneous that the various agencies take
part in the parade.
One of the most significant features of
the novel undertaking was the selection of
a marshal for the division. To D. \V.
Hitchcock, the well-known general agent
of the Union Pacific Railroad, was ac
corded the special honor, because up to
the present campaign he has been widely ;
and generally known to his associates in
the railroad service as a life-long Demo
crat of the old Jeffersonian school. This
time he will cast his first Republican vote,
and it will be for McKinley.
Mr. Hitchcock could not be at the meet
ing, but the following committee was ap
pointed to notify him at his office: M. M.
Stern of the Canadian Pacific, Frank
McCormack of the Hock Island . road, F.
F. Connor of the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company, W. D. Snedaker of
the Rio Grande, H. Fahnestock of the
American Line Steamship Company and
C. L. Caufield of the > Rock Island road.
As chairman Mr. Stern told Mr. Hitch
cock of his appointment and welcomed
him into the Republican ranks. v
In a happy little speech Mr. Hitchcock
accepted the position. He will appoint
his aids to-day.
The committee of arrangements, of
which M. M. Stern is chairman, will meet
at 10 o'clock this morning to decide "upon
the character of uniforms to be worn and
to attend to other matters. A novel and
attractive showing is promised, as all the
participants are enthusiastic and declare
that there can be no suggestion of any
coercion in what they have so heartily
pone in for.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company
has made special round-trip rates from
neighboring towns. The rate will be good
on all trains arriving here Saturday lore
noon and returning Saturday afternoon or
Sunday.
Round trip rates will be as follow?:
From Sacramento '. S3 ' 30
From Stockton. 3 35
From Calistoga ':........... 3 10
From Santa Rosa... 2 OO
From Vacavllle...... 1 70
From tivertnore 1 70
From San Jose 1 70
Special rates on the same scale of re
duction will be given from all the inter
mediate stations. ' Â» :'-;'
Some of the towns are forming parties
and buying tickets in blocks of sixty to
secure chartered car rates which will be a
trifle less even than the general reduction. I
Great interest is being shown all down
the line in the Reed meeting to be held at
Stockton to-niirht. The railroad has made
speciai reduced round-trip rates for that
also. A special train will be run Jrom
Sacramento to Stockton to take persons
wishing to hear 'the great Maine orator
Epeak. A similar arrangement of special
rates has been made for the Reed meeting
â at San Jose to-morrow night. Â

following were present: Henry Sonntag,
Wendell Easton, G. H. Umbsen, 0. A. yon
Rhein, John Pforr, Charles Spader, G. W.
Jsurnham, David Rich, A. J. Rich. .
It was decided to issue a general call to
clients and property-owners. They will
be invited to participate â¢ with the real
estate division, which will have banners,
fifths and a band. This division will
travel in carriages.
Martin J. Burke was elected grand mar
shal. He is the oldest real estate man in
the City.
The textile-dealers had a meeting at the
Board of Trade yesterday to further
perfect plans. They will issue a circular
to the trade forthwith. All who desire to
take part under this division should re
port to Phil Fisher, chairman of tne com
mittee.
At an enthusiastic meeting of the fruit
deaiers yesterday afternoon the following
committees were appointed by Chairman
Allison:
Financeâ Messrs. Lowenthal, Freeman,
Jaudin and Calm.
Musicâ Messrs. Holloway, Rowley and
Lowenstein.
A. D. Cutter was elected grand marshal.
There are evidences that more than 1500
men will parade.
The metal and iron workers had a meet
ing at the Board of Trade yesterday aiter
noon. It was reported that 1348 names
have already been signed to the lista and
that 1500 will march.
The harness men will join with the
metal-workers. Fifteen hundred badges
and an equal number of chrysanthemums,
canes and hats will be provided, and the
First Regiment band will be engaged.
Now that rates have been secured there
is every evidence that there will be a large
attendance from Santa Cruz. The Re
publicans there were only waiting fora
rate before promising a large delegation.
All members of the fraternal insurance
orders who are interested in the election
of McKinley will meet at the Alcazar
building to-morrow evening to make ar
rancements to participate in the day
parade on Saturday, October 31. It is ex
pected that a large number of fraternal
men from the different organizations will
be present.
The leading officers of the Order of
Chosen Friends, the American Legion of
Houor and Knights of Honor have already
signified their intention to be present.
The temporaiy committee consists of: C.

POLICE AND CORONAN DIFFER.
Jhere Is Tet Mystery Connected With
the Death of Andrua.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 27.â But little
has been done in the way of clearing up
the mystery surrounding the death of H.
J. Andrus of Yonkers on Wednesday last
Coroner Mills continues to say that he has
some information as to the persons con
nected with what he believes to have been
a murder, but the Coroner and police are
in accord neither in theory nor in action.
So far a3 can be learned the only step
taken in rpgard to the Andrus affair was
an examination of the safe deposit vault
of the Yonkers National Bank, in which
the will of the dead man was supposed to
have been placed. This examination
showed that there was no will in the
vaalt nor anything else of any importance.
The lanuly say that the will may be in
one of the safes of the office of the Arling
ton Chemical Company, of which Andrus
was secretary, and the safes will be opened
to-day. The inquest was to have been
held yesterday, but it was postponed until
more definite information can be secured
by the authorities.
PRINCE LOUIS OF SAVOY.

Brotherly Lore
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Oct. 27.â Prince
Louis of Savoy, who has been the recipi
ent of much social attention since his ar
rival here on the Italian cruiser Crisinfero
Colombo, and who returned last evening

BURGLAR CADER THE DED
After Seeking the Man for Ten Jears
a Woman Is Rewarded.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa., Oct. 27. -All
things come to those who wait, and such
was the experience of Mrs. Bernard Hai
kins, 7722 Woorjlawn avenue, last night.
It has been Mrs. Harkins' custom every
night for the last ten years before retiring
to look under the be>l. Last night sue
looked under the same as usual, and
uttered a scream of fright, for the soles of
a man's shoes were clearly to be seen. He
was there, for sure, and her ten years of
waiting were patiently rewarded.
Mrs. Harkins' screams brought her hus
band and he pulled the would-be house
breaker from under the bed. Mrs. Har
kins yelled ''Police!" and her husband
held the burglar until the police arrived.
The captured man proved to be Elmer
Elroerdine, a burglar who has a long rec
ord in criminal annals.
Found Head Sear Red Bluff.
RED BLUFF, Cal., Oct. 27.â The body
of D. B. Rowland was found by the road
side about five miles south of Ked Blnff
this morning. He was in town yesterday in
apparently good health and started home
toward evening facing a rain and wind
storm. There were do bruises of any
kind on the body and the supposition that
be must have had some affliction of the
heart, which, combined with the exposure,
caused his death. No truce of bis wagon
could be found, but the mules be was
driving were found near by. Rowland
was 47 years old and a native of Washing
ton. He leaves a family.
Judge Robert Feehal won the respect
of everybody as Superior Judge. He is
popular with all classes and will be re
turned to the bench. His voting number

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1896.
LOS ANGELES GREETS
MAINE'S FAVORITE SON
Continued from First Page-
tain the credit of this Nation unimpaired,
it was supplied in this gathering of true
and tried voters.
The day opened with rain and a cold
wind, which continued up to noon, and
the mettle of the gathered thousands was
indicated when it was given out from
headquarters of commanders and leaders
that "We shall march auyway, rein or
shine." '*
But just as Mr. Reed's train reached
La Grande station the clouds suddenly
divided and rolling mountainward let
through the gladsome sunlight. There
was no rain in the afternoon.
The parade consisted of eight distinct
divisions. Amid the tremendous throngs
the Americus Uniformed Club of Pasadena
deserves special mention. It 3 banners,
gorgeous white uniforms and flags were a
splendid spectacle of the day.
A significant feature of the outpouring
to-dny was the palpable and generally re
marked fact that those in line were of the
best and most thrifty American citizens
and nearly all of them voters. The
Lankersbeim delegation carried red, white
and blue pampas plumes and easily stood
second in the matter of decorations among
the country clubs. The Soldiers' Home
sent over 300 veterans. Many were
Fcarcely able to walk, but they did their
best and added their nine to the enthusi
asm. The speaker came in for a great
deal of cheering all along the route, and
by the frequent outbursts of cheering it
was plain tlial Congressman McLachlan
was as popular as ever.
The ladies in tally-hos won the admira
tion of the people who lined the side
walks. They received tlie plaudits with
that modesty so becoming to Southern
Californian ladies.
The line of march was from the plaza
south on Main street to Spring, thence to
Seventh, east on the latter street to Ath
letic Park. The first division was a large
one, composed as it was of several hundred
veterans of the late war, the Citizens'
Sound-money Club, wholesale and retail
merchants and their employes, with la
dies, followed in tally-hos. The guest of
the day was in the position assigned him
in the first division, in a carriage drawn
by four splendid horses, having for his
escort the members of the Republican
committee and as a special escort mem
bers of the Pine Tree State Association.
Continual cheers greeted the distinguished
statesman, and he smilingly responded.
In the carriase with Mr. Reed were Con
gressman McLachlan, Dr. G. W. Cochran
and George H. Stewart. The carriage was
beautifully decorated with yellow chrys
anthemums.
The second division was one of the
longest in the parade. It was made up en
tireiy of country delegations. They came
from every point within a radius of 100
miles.
In the third division the Los Angeles
Military baud was in the lead. Then came
the Young Men's League, Young Men's
Sound-money League, the McKinley Club,
the Colored McKinley Club and pupils
from the High School.
The fourth division was where Pasadena
people displayed themselves. All the Re
publican clubs of that city were repre
sented by full membership. They were
headed by their own band, and to keep
them company and as a continual in
spiration a number ot young ladies in
tally-hos paraded with them.
In the nftli division were assembled hun
dreds of German-Americans, who will
vote on NovemDcr 3 as ti.ey cheered
to-day. They made a fine appearance.
Following them came quite an army of
colored men composing the McKinley
Club of the Golden West.
The country was again very conspicuous
in the sixth division. There were clubs
from Ventura, Orange, Alhambra, Mon
rovia, Duarte, Sierra Madre, Long Beach,
Lankersbeim, San Gabriel, North Ontario,
Covinia, Hyde Park, Inglewood, Wil
mington, Redondo, Cahuenga, Redlands,
El Monte, Santa Monic, Glendale, Whit
tier and other places.
In the seventh division were the South
ern Pacific employes, sound-money clubs,
the Railroad Men's Sound-money Club
and the Workingmen's Sound-money
Club. The railroad men numbered 700.
They were the most enthusiastic of the
marchers.
The eighth division was made up of all
classes of citizens who favor sound money,
an honest dollar and a chance to earn it.
NEEDS OF THE NATION.
Speaker' Reed's 1 poeal for an
Honest Currency and Protec
tion to Industries.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 27.â N0 man
could estimate the thousands who
thronged into Athletic Park to hear Mr.
Reed's speech. A number of newspaper
men who have seen and estimated vast
standing multitudes pronounced this one
the largest they ever saw. None of them
placed the figures below 40,000, while some
said 50,000. Of course, but a modicum of
these could hear the speaker, and this con
stituted the greatest and saddest disap
pointment of the day. Many thousands
left the grounds when they realized that
not one word could be understood at their
distance from the speaker. The grand
stand and bleachers were crowded by ladies
who could not catch a single word, partly
owing to a brisk west wind, which Dlew all
the afternoon.
When Mr. Reed entered a great cheer
went up and thousands of people waved
flags. On the speaker's stand were mem
bers of the Supreme Court, Hon. Thomas
Fitch, Congressman J. F, Aldrica and wife
of Chicago, Miss Reed, ex-Governor Pa
cheoo and other prominent citizens.
George Stewart, president of the Busi
ness Men's Sound Money Club, called the
vast throng to order and briefly introduced
Hon. James McLachlan, who, he said,
had been in Congress with Mr. Reed, and
whom the people were going to send bacK
to Congress. Mr. McLachlan said the
people had turned out not to hear him,
but to hear one of the greatest men in the
United States, who had come across the
continent for the express purpose of speak
ing to the people of the coast. He then
introduced Mr. Reed. The cheering as
Reed arose lasted for fully five minutes.
Speaker Reed said in part:
For the first time In my life I find myself
facing a multitude so great that it seems to
me an absolute hopeless task to attempt to
reach one-half of them. Your presence here
to-day is a much greater speech than I can
make. It shows your determination. It shows
that the cause of righteousness hat found a
foothold on the Pacific Coast.
California, alone and of itself, Is a great em
pire. I told the people of New York eight
years ago that if their State were three times
embroidered on the map of California you
could then put Pennsylvania there also, and
then have room for other States. But great
as California is in its surface area it is greater
still in its resources, in its natural wealthâ a
wealth of almost uncounted millions. Never
theless, you labor under some disadvantages.
You are separated from the great markets of
the world by the great ocean on one side,
which bridges the way from a population
which you have no desire to become acquaint
ed with. You are separated on the other siao
by the thousands of miles of wnat used to be
called a desert, but which I refuse to believe
will always remain a desert. At present you
are shut off from your market You ought to
be wiiliDg and anxious enough that its dis
tance should be no obstacle.
On the issues of the present campaign,
whether McKinley is elected or not, I don't
mean to dwell. That is for you to consider
among yourselves. There is another point
upon which I wish to speak. For once ia my
life I had an opportunity to say words of in
terest, perhaps, and I seized upon the oppor
tunity to say them in Maiue after the Maine
election. The result of that election showed
tnat there is great common sense in the
northeastern corner of the United States of
America, and I can see by this assemblage that
there is as great comniou sense in the South
west.
We have been dallying with the silver ques
tion for years, but we have now a field lor
warm discussion, and it is astonishing to see
how little there is in it. I hardly know how
to broach it. I hardly know how to discuss it,
unless I discuss it here in California as I did
in Maine, upon the basis of common sense.
This world is governed not by superior men,
but by the common sense of the average citi
zen of the United States, and unless I can pre
sent arguments which will be satisfactory to
him I talk in vain.
Money is a transferer of value, just the same
as a hay rake is a transferer of hay. You
would not expect to increase the hay by add
ing more hoy rakes. Let us see what the fact
is. In 1878 we went to work and bought
$2,000,000 worth of silver a month under the
Bland law. Then, in 1890 we bought 4,500,000
ounces of silver. Thnt is about all we maae
in America. What was the result? Why,
there was a tremendous increase in demand.
Then what was the resultâ higher piice?
Why, no; it went right down, just as if it had
been lead instead of silver. Now, I want to
ask you if coining the whole American product,
or nearly the whole, has resulted in lowering
the price of silver, what wi!l coining the rest
of the silver in the world do? Isn't that simple
arithmetic? Well, don't let us have any more
weak subterfuges in connection with this.
Prove something or quit the field.
I think that when we consider all questions
connected with the currency we had better
consider them from a point of view of our uot
being an exception to the natural laws. I
think we had belter make up our minds that
water will run down hill in the United States,
and that the attraction of gravitation, in order
to be withstood, has to be withstood by an
awful power in the opposite direction. [Laugh
ter and applause.] In other words no mira
cles will be performed for us.
Now, it is proposed to change the currency
of this country; not to change it a little, but
to change it seriously and radically. Of course
it is claimed that this change is to be for the
country's benefit. But singularly enough the
gentlemen who are advocating the change
nevei condescend to show us how it is going to
benefit the country. They simply receive us
With the statement that they believe so and
so will happen. Now, as I said before, "we be
lieve" is a very good foundation for the ora
tor. It does very well where you are not
going to contest it until you come to the next
world. [Laughter and applause.] But in the
world of business "we believe" is worth
nothing.
But they say that the farmer will get im
mediate relief by the free coinage of silver.
Let us see. Are there any among us who
wishes to discharge his indebtedness with 50
--cent dollars? In the first place such a man,
even upon Democratic theory, cannot be quite
honest who wants to pay his debts at 50 cents
on the dollar because of a depreciation which
they claim for silver since thÃt fated year
1873T All they claim for it is a drop of 5
cents. They say that that came in
twenty yearsâ twenty-one years, to be exact.
That is what they say. Well, now, if there is a
man here whose debts run back to that time
I would like to see him. I think; he has been
lucky and has the confidence of the commu
nity. [Applause and laughter.] On an aver
age there is no debt that la four years, old.
Are you going to settle with your creditor and
pay him one quarter, take one quarter of the
depreciation, or are you going to take the
whole? If you are going to Uke the whole
you are not honest.
Whether you are honest or not, if you do
that sort of thin? you will get into trouble.
In this world as a whole the privilege of bor
rowing is of more consequence than the re
pudiation of debts, even if you can do it hon
estly. If the inrme'r gets rid of one-half of
his debts he will still have the other half to
struggle with, and he is going to struggle with
it in a world that does not believe much in
him. In other words, the one-half that he did
not pay comes out of somebody, spoils some
body's business and spoils the business of the
whole community, as I will point out to you
in a few moments â absolutely spoils it, and he
has got to pay that under a disadvantage that
will make him wish he had a good, prosperous
country and v/as going to pay the whole. I
s'jy that it does not pay to do this thing
because the power of borrowing is of the ut
most importance.
You know there there is a vast difference
between dreamland and the world of fact. In
dreamland the creditor is a rich man and
every debtor is a poor man. The time was
when a debt used to represent how far behind
a man had got in the world. To-day it repre
sents his belief in the fature. Some of our
ablest and strongest men are the men who in
the time of prosperity carry the biggest load
of debt.
Every big institution in the country is in
debt, and when it is the most prosperous it is
iv debt the most. Take a great comimny that
I know of. In times of prosperity it borrows
$5,000,000 ox $10,000,000. In times ot ad
versity it lends money to other people. If you
will think a moment you will see that there is
not any enterprise upon which civilization is
dependent that is not dependedton the borrow
ing power.
What does the borrowing power depend on?
It depends on the confidence and honesty of
the people at large. A dishonest community
cannot borrow money. It is not every man
who has money who will lend it, notwithstand
ing the statements of some people to the con
trary.
Now, let us put ihat to a plain test. Suppose
there were in this audience some gentlemen
who have $10 â probably several thousand.
Now, I want to ask each one of these gen
tlemen: If a man came to you and told you
he wanted to borrow that $10 and said frankly
be was only going to pay you $5 back, would
you let him have the money, or would you let
it lie idle? But suppose you thought you
would like to make a good turn there, what
would you do? The first thing would be to get
50 per cent for risk, and then you would want
about 10 per cent more for incidentals aud you
would give him $4 and take his note for $10.
As a matter at fact, of course, you would not
lena it.
Now, if you will not loan a man $10, do you
suppose any man with .f 100 has any less sense
than you have? Don't you suppose that a for
eigner knows as much about that as you do?
Here is a plain question: Here is a great
country, rich, but not with 10 per cent of the
riches absolutely necessary to develop there-
Eources in sight, but undeveloped; here is a
country that not only wants its own money,
but dfcnts the money of everybody else on the
face of the earth, and we propose to borrow
money of the people of this country and bor
row the money of people of other countries,
with the distinct understanding that we will
borrow it upon a gold basis, anq if we can
possibly do it, will repay it on a silver basis.
Do you think we can get it? If we won't got it
are we not acting like a lot of foolish persons?
Our busine-s prosperity is depending on our
action, and here we are dallying with this
question. We are not going to dally with it in
the East, are you here?
Can you conceive any advantage that It
would be to you as a community to have a
barrel of flour worth $5 in our present money
become worth $10 in money only half as valu
able! Oh, but you say that "we believe that
silver will appreciate and bacome just like
gold." I wish to remark if that is so the poor
farmer whose debts are going to be paid is go
ing to be lost somewhere In this shuffle. But
I leave him to take care of himself and say in
response to the statement of these gentlemen
who "believe" that the facts of human history
are against their belief. Why, I could even
cite China and Japan and that republic of
Mexico, which some seem to think deserves
imitatingâ l could eveu cite them to show the
folly of their proposition, but I prefer to con
tinue citation of the history of the United
States, which is good enougn for me.
"Why," they say, "don't you recognize the
great law of supDly and demand? When there
is a demand how can prices help going up?"
Temporarily, yes. But there is another great
law of demand and supply which is more im
perious still, ana that is that whenever, there
is a big demand there is always a big supply
following that and that the big supply is al
ways sold at a less profit.
lam going tt> say one word mor?. Gentle
men of the West, I see by your attitude, by
this great audience and by everything 1 have
heard since I came here that you are going to
allow U3 in the East to agree with you on the
subject of finance. If there is any superiority
of common-sense you have it in tlie West
rather than the East. That it U not because
you are the better men: it is because you are
in close contact with the development with
this country and you are obliged to be more
sensible, and you are nghfug the enemy band
to hand.
I don't pretend to be a prophet; I can only
Judge the future by the past. Mr. MeKinley Is
going to represent you. Let him be elected by
a good healthy majority in a good splendid
Californian way.
In addition to the afternoon parade and
gathering, another great Republican
meeting assembled this evening at j
Hazard's Pavilion. This large hall was
crowded in every nook, corner and cranny.
There were no less than 7000 people at the
meeting. The speakers wore Mr. Reed
and Hon. Thomas Fitch, the "silver
tongued orator." The Maine statesman's
time wns limited, so he spoke only a few
minutes, recounting his astonishment at
seeing the tremendous crowd of the after
noonand the general enthusiasm, which
he pronounces beyond anything he ever
witnessed. This, the speaker said, could
mean but one thing, and that was that
California would go for McKinley and
Hobart by a stupendous majority.
Speaker Reed said in a conversation this
evening that the throng of the afternoon
at Athletic Park was the largest he ever
attempted to address in his life.
This bas great significance when it is
remembered that Mr. Reed has been in
public life for thirty years and made hun
dreds of speeches, many of then} of his
toric and international interest. The dis
tinguished guest left for the north on the
regular San Francisco train at 9 p. m., amid
a shower of plaudits and the best wishes of
thousands of Southern Califoriiians.
Mr. Reed and party were accompanied
north by the San Francisco reception com
mittee. Mr. Reed is billed to speak at
Stockton to-morrow evening.
Following Reed's address at the pavil
ion came one of Fitch's soul-stirring
speeches. He spoke for more than an hour
on the issues of the campaign, showing in
true Tom Fitch style the fallacies and va
garies of tbe Bryanites. It was a terrific
arraignment of the calamity-howling ele
ment in societyâ of the Tillmans, the Alt
gelds and the Cators.
PRIDE OF PASADENA.
The Americus Uniformed Club Pro-
nounced California's Best Cam-
paigrn Organization.
PASADENA, Cal., Oct. 27.â The Ameri
cas Club of this city, which was prom
inent in the parade at Los Angeles to-day,
is said by Senator Perkins and others
equally good judges to be the crack cam
paign club of tbe State. The clnb was
organized on August 6 with a member
ship of forty-five young men, and the list
kept climbing in numbers until a grand
total of 180 uniformed members has been
reached. Even the most sanguine of its
organizers did not at first expect more
than 100 marchers, considering tne fact
that Pasadena has but 2330 voters, and the
number of young men is exceptionally
f" w in proportion to the size of ihe town.
Were the list still open for new members
it is probable that the club would have a
total of 300 or 400 men.
After the ciub was fairly started two
nights a week were spent in drilling
under the efficient supervision of
Captain N. 8. Bangham of the
National Guard o,f California, and each
member entered into the work with a spirit
and zest that made it but natural that the
club should acquire such a degree of skill
and reputation as entitles it to be consid
ered the best drilled and most attractive
looking organization in the State.
One important fact in regard to this
club is that its members are of the very
best class, the greater portion of them be
ing first voters. Some at the beginning of
the campaign were out-and-out Bryan
men.
The club uniform includes a white duck
coat trimmed with yellow braid, white
trousers, white cap and yellow leggins,
the effect of w&ich is very striking. Each
member carries a small silk flag on a
white staff surmounted by a gold knob
and a small lamp with red and blue glass
sides. The club has its own fife, drum and
bugle corps of nine members and a drum
major. â¢
The officers of the club are: Major, Ni S.
Bahgham; staff â Adjutant, Edwin
Steams; sureeon, J. W. Wood; quarter
master, W. E. Arthur; commissary. H.
M. Dobbins; ordnance officer, John Mc-

AWFUL TRIPLE MURDER
Mrs Jessie Winner and Two
Babies Are Most Brutally
Butchered.
The Woman's Skirl Battered anl the
Throats of the Children Are
Cut.
RICHMOND, Mo , Oct. 27.â The com
munity is shocked by the discovery to
day of a frigbtfal triple murder. The
perpetrator of tbe crime is still at larce
and his identity is concealed, but indig
nant neighbors have their suspicions and
it will not be long before the triple mur
derer is caught.
The murderous acts were committed
some time last night. Mrs. Jessie Win
ner, a respectable bard-working woman,
and her two babies, aged two and one
years, were killed. The woman's sieull
was battered in and the top of her head
cut off. She had apparently made a tight
for her liie and had been bsaten down by
the murderer. The throats of the two
little children were cut and they lay in a
pool of blood.
A pathetic feature of the murder was
the presence of a little deaf and dumb
child or Mrs. Winner by another mar
riage. The little one is unable to tell any
thing about the crime. It has not been
educated at all and is not able to write
and can barely tell what its simplest
wants are.
So far the citizens have not been able to
discover any definite clew to the mur
derer. He very carefully left no traces be
hind him. One thing is settled, however,
and that is the fact that the murders were
not committed for the purpose of robbery.
There is every indication that revenge
was the motive for tbe crime.
The nearest neighbors beard no signs ot
the struggle which must have occurred
when the woman was killed. She always
was a very quiet little woman and never
meddled with any one else or received
many callers. She bad quite a number of
friends in the neighborhood.
The peculiar atrocity of the crime has
made the people here very angry, and
there is strong talk of lynching the mur
derer when be is caught.

Delegations From New England
and Ohio Visit Major
McKinley.
MANY WOMEN AMONG THEM.
"This Is a Year When Partisanship
Counts for Naught and Patriot
ism for Everthing."
â¢ . CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 27.â Canton has
nad another beautiful day of mild Indian
summer weather and seven delegations
took advantage of it to call on Major Mc-
Kinley. His visitors to-daj came from
New England and Ohio. Two delegations
were composed wholly of women. The
moÂ«t elaborate speech of the day was the
one addressed to the Sound Money Leacue
of New England, and it was received wit a
fervent demonstrations 'of approval.
. Every delegation to-day brought great
clusters of flowers for both Major and Mrs.
." McKinley.
The first delegation to arrive was a large
one from the mountain counties of West
Virginia and Maryland. A delegation of
'* about seventy-five ladies from Martins
Ferry arrived with the Virginia and
Maryland people. They were presented
to Major McKiniey ia a graceful speech by
Henry Pratt.
Major McKinley thanked them cordially
for the compliment of their call and ad
diessed them with the larger delegation.
He did not make a speech to the Martins
Ferry delegation for the reason that it
came in with another delegation and did
not ask for a separate address.
! The next, delegation came from Cleve
land, ana was composed of about 10G0
employes in the aggregate of the Ujsou
Nut Company, the Lampson-Sessions
â¢ Company, and the Peck, Stow and Wilcox
Company. The delegation was a hilarious
; and uncommonly enthusiastic one. Ma
. jor McKinley's appearance was greeted
with thunders of applause and cbeers
that continued for several minutes.
The spokesman said that a large num
ber of the men in the delegation voted for
free trade four years ago and that they
had been sorry for it ever since and pro
posed to reverse the verdict they helped
to render then. Major McKinley took
up this line of thought ana discussed the
tariff for several minutes.
Pressing closely behind tbe Cleveland
. ;delegations were the 500 workingmen from
. : the Junction Iron and Steel Works of
"Mingo Junction, Ohio. Captain W. J.
Xjrquhart introduced them to -McKinley,
â¢who addressed them standing in iron t of
â  .'his lawn.
A special train of handsoms Wagner
sleeping and dining cars brought a fine
delation from Boston and New England
ci ies at 2 o'clock. The excursion was
under the auspices of the Boston Herald.
The members of the New England
. Sound Money League, who composed the
delegation, was met. at the station by the
mounted Canton troop and the widely
known Grand Army band and a commit
â¢ tee of prominent citizens, who escorted
them to M;i jor McKinley's residence. The
spokesman lor the New England visitors
'was Hon. Frank W. Rollins, who ad
dressed Major McKinley with great earn
estness and eloquence.
"This delegation brought several gifts
, to Major .McKinley. R. A. Soule
of New Bedford presented him with a
large cutglass punch-bowl and some hand
somely polished whales' teeth, O. W.
Holmes, on the part of the Salem Cogs
well Republican Club, with a golden
witch spoon, and the women of Massa
chusetts, through Mrs. Emma Almy, sent
Major McKinley a twig from a pear tree
' planted in Danvers in 1630 by Governor
Etidicott. A letter was read from tbe
Governor of Massachusetts wishing the
delegation a pleasant journey, and one
from Edward P. Shaw.
Mr. McKinley addressed the New Eng
land delegation in part as follows:
This is a yenr, my fellow-citizens, when par
tisanship counts for naught and patriotism
for everything. It is not a question simply as
to whether one party or another s-hall win, as
in times pastâ that sinks into comparative in
significance in a crisis like thisâ but it is a
question whether now, in our great strength,
we shall proclaim to the world whether or not
we are a Nation of peoole that can b$ trusted
or whether we shall allow it said that we, the
people of the United States, believe in paying
our honest aebts in bits of metal stamped in
the name and by the authority of the great
Republic as worth a hundred cents for all
duties, public and private, when in fact they
are worth only 50 cents.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart
or this callâ not as a tribute to mo; far from
that, but as a tribute to the holiest cause in
â which citizens of a free republic ever were
engagedâ that ol maintaining their honor and
credit.
A well organized and interesting delega
tion of women from Norwalk, Ohio, were
the next callers. There were more than
300 in line when they marched up the
streets accompanied by a reception com
mittee of Canton ladies. Each woman in
in the delegation carried a red, white ami
blue umbrella. They marched well and
bad several bands. Tbe ladies were
greeted with cheers and applause along
the line of march.
Mrs. H. A T loxoro was marshal and
Mrs. L. 11 Laylin made the address to
Major McKinley. It was a ringing politi
cal ;-p ech and she was freely arplauded.
Mrs. George S. Titus presented Mrs. Mc-
Kinley with flowers. The Norwnlk ladies
were introduced to Major McKinley by
Mr?. R. W. Day of Canton. After Major
McKinley's remarks to the Norwalk ladies
they sang "The Red, White and Blue."
The last delegation to-day was a
sprightly one composed of about 300 mem
bers of the Underwriters' Sound-money
Club of Cleveland. Major McKinley
made the most stirring speech of the day
to the underwriters.
FUN NAME AND COUSVET.
" Chairman Jlannn ' lisifs ""a. Final Ap
-4 peal to :Voter*.":
1' CHICAGO,. 111.. Oct. 27.â 0n behalf of
Hie Republican National Committee Chair
'ftian Hanna issued to-day his last appeal,
addressad "To Voters." After impressing
upon their minds the fact that the destiny
. of .the Nation is in their bands he advises
them to calmly and carefully think before
they vote in the seclusion of their booths;
with their conscience as their only guide.
He urges them to look upon the flag as
they go to the polls and reflect on the cost
of its preservation.
They are reminded of the cnlltodis-'
play the flag next Saturday and are asked
to let the National colors remain until
after the election as an inspiration to
voter 3 and a universal expression of pa
triotism. Finally patriotic voters are
asked to "secure for these great principles
â good money, good government ana pro
tection to your home and your flar â at
least one other vote by individual effort,"
and the women of the country are es
.pecially appealed to for effective work in
tlii* direction.
Special dispatches were received by Mr.
Hanna from lowa, giving the expected
majority there for McKinley at 50,000;
from Minnesota, claiming the State by
30,000 to 40,000; from Michigan, putting
the mnjority there at 30.000, and from
Kentucky, placing that State in the Mc-
Kinley column by 15,000 to 25 000. The
Tennessee State Committee also sent in
formation to Mr. Hanna tnat it won d go
Republican.
r ihe Bryan demonstration under the
walls of the headquarters building did
not have any perceptible effect on the
spirits of the campaign chairman or on his
subordinates. He was as confident as
ever, and said Bryan had come to Chicago
too iate to make any serious inroads upon
the Republican ranks. Mr. Hanna said:
"This Bryan noise does not send any cold
shivers chasing up and down my spinal
column. Nearly all tbe voters have got
their minds made up on the main issue,
so that any changes which Mr. Bryan may
effect while here will not show materially
in the result."
CAN TOTE AS THEY PLEASE.
Chauneey ill. Jtepeu) Hays liailroad Men
Are ->ot Coerced.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Oct. 27.â There
have been a number of charges made by
the Democrats that the employer* of rail
road men were attempting to coerce their
employes and compel them to vote for
McKinley.
Cliauncey M. Depew, president of the
New York Central Railroad, has been in
censed greatly over thei-e charges, because
he is at ttie head of a system which em
ploys a large number of men. He said to
a reporter yesterday :
"I went to Rochester last weet to ap
pear before a meeting of the railroad men
for the specific purpose of informing them
myself that the railroad of which 1 am
president, or its board ol directors, does
not intend and will not do anything what
soever to require a man to vote in any way
except as his conscience may dictate. As
the official head of this road I know that
the board of directors and stockholders
wish tne men to have absolute political
independence. No man ever has been
asked or requested in any way to vote for
any one or anything. If I learn that an
official of this road attempts in any way to
coerce an employe, no matter how high or
low, I shall discharge him immediately.
Every railroad man has a right to vote aS
he pleases, and so has every one else to do
so."
IOWA SAFE FOR McKINLEY.
Repulicans Will Hare a Majority in the
State of 75.000.
DES MOINES. jowa, Oct. 27.â Chairman
McMillan of the Republican State Com
mittee to-day gave out a detailed state
ment claiming the State by 75,000 for Mc-
Kinley.^ His figures are as follows: Mc-
Kinley "251,113, Bryan 175,926, Palmer
85C0, Prohibition (two tickets) 4500.
Mr. McMiflan says that in the last four
years the widest variation ever made by
the Republican poll from the result of tbe
election in 1892, when the poll showed the
State Republican by 30,000 and it went
only 23,000. This year's is the best poll
ever made. He gives the figures on a large
number of counties whick the silver men
have claimed by reason of great defections
from Republican ranks, and shows that
they are all safely Republican. Three per
cent of the Republican vote, or 7500, he
concedes for Bryan. He claims 30,000 Dem
ocratic votes. The tendency of the last
two weeks has been for all sound-money
Democrats to vote for McKinley. Ger
mans, railroad men and business men
make up tbe Democratic vote for McKin
ley. Mr. McMillan claims all the Con
gressional districts for the Republicans.

WEST VIRGINIA IN LINE
Voters Will Anote Under Bryan and free
Silver.
NEW YORK, X V., Oct. 27. -George
Wise, chairman of the Republican ad
visory committee of West Virginia, writes
to Assistant Secretary Perkins at Repub
lican National headquarters as follows:
"There is positively no question about
West Virginia. We are lo have a great
sound-money demonstration here Novem
ber 2, when Republicans and sound
money Democrats will join hands against
Bryanism. Wo shall g*ve McKinley and
Hobart a handsome plurality."
General Powell Clayton, who is in
charge of the speakers' bureau at Repub
lican headquarters, said this afternoon:
"The letters I am receiving from our
speakers in what may be called the doubt
ful Southern States are most encouraging
in character. The reports from Tennessee,
West Virginia, Maryland and North Caro
lina all indicate that lhese Stales will cast
their electoral votes for McKinley."
BEWARE OF FELLOW JACK.
There Is Danger of the Disease Coining
From Cuba.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 27.â The
public health report, issued by the Marine
Hospital Service, brings to the attention
of the authorities the dancer of importing
yellow fever from Cuba through a new and
hitherto unknown agency. Dr. D. M.
Burgess, sanitary inspector from Havana,
writes 10 Surgeon-General Wyman under
date of October 17:
"I cm informed that the Government
here has appr> priated and is already using
foi hospital purposes the extensive alma
cenes or sugar store-houses < f Re^la,
whichstructures.it will be remembered,
are situated contiguous to the wharf on
the opposite side of the harbor from this
city. This measure, or course, will infect
those buildings, and possibly much sugar
may be stored in them."
Dr. Burgess says: "Yellow fever does
not exist to any great extent among
civilians in this city, oÂ»ving to the fact
that few of such persons have come here 1
during the past year ,vho are liable to
have it. But that disease continues with
ail its malignancy and perhaps increasing
numbers among the Spanish soldiers.
The statistics of the many military hospi
tals in the neienborhood of Havana, that
is to say within a radius of twenty-five
miles or so, cannot at present be obtained,
if ever.
"Sixty-one of the sixty-five deaths from
yellow fever during the week were among
Spanish soldiers in the military hospitals,
while the remaining four deaths from
that disease were among civilians in the
city. .
"Smallpox here is now limited almost
entirely to civilians, nnd the Spanish
troops are now supposed to be vaccinated
either before leaving Spain or on their
way here.
"All the deaths from smallpox were
among civilians in poor circumstances."

CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 27.â A conquering
hero returning home from victories galore
could, not have been more royally wel
comed than was William J. Bryan on his
arrival in Chicago this afternoon. The
enthusiasm was remarkable. Crowds
lined the entire route over which he
passed, from the railway station to the
scene of his initial speech in his fight for
Cook County, and maintained a continu
ous cheering. Many organizations pledged
to support the Democratic nominee were
in the escort procession, brass bands
clayed patriotic marching airs with a visor
born of the excitement along the way,
and altogether from the time his train
came to a standstill in the Union depot j
until he concluded his address at Battery j
B amory he was lauded by thousands of
enthusiasts with such heartiness of voice
ana action that he could not help feeling
gratified nnd showing that gratification in
his remarks.
A wild xhriek that continued to crow in
I volume went up from the big crowds lining
every approach to the Union depot when
I Bryan's special pulled in at 3:30, exactly
ion time. The poiice nad done very well
I in their endeavor to keep the people out of
I the inclos-ure wheie the trains stand, out a
couple of thousand men and boys eluded
the blue-coats, and made a dash for the
, private car in which Mr. Bryan has tray-
I eled for the past three weeks. The police
i we^e almost powerless in their attempt to
I keep the shouting enthusiasts from over
! whelming the candidate and his wife, and
it was only by a hard struggle that they
were pushed, pulled and wedged to a stair
way leading to the street.
This proved an island of safety, for tho
police turned on the excited mob follow
ing Mr. ana Mrs. Bryan and Kept them
from going farther. Outside street and
sidewalk were crowded. A great cheer
went up as the candidate stepped into a
carriage drawn by four white horses. After
j some delay the procession started, the car
j riage containing Mr. and Mrs. Bryan pass-
I ing through a double line of political or
! ganizations, which fell into line and fol
j lowed after it. The central committee of
I the Cook County People' 9 party organ
] izntion, the central committee of the
1 Democratic party of Cook County, the
j "Silver Leagne of Cook County i ihe preÂ»i
--j dents and secretaries of Democratic and
1 silver clubs of Cook County, the Carter
Harrison Association, Cook County Dem
ocracy Marching Club, a Nebraska free
! Silver club, and Bryan clubs composed of
j Germans, Irish, French, Polish, Bohe-
I minn, Hebrew and other foreign nation- j
alities were in the parade.
The candidate hail as his personal escort j
a large body of men, composing the Clii- !
! capo reception committee, who marched !
beside 1 is carriage over the entire route. |
They proceeded up Canal street to Mad 1 .- !
son, to Filth avenue, to Washington street,
to Clark, to Monroe and to Battery D, ar- !
riving at the intersection of Monroe with |
Michigan avenue. All along the ground
about the line of march the greatest en
thusiasm was manifested. Hisses were
heard frequently. They came principally
from people who swarmed in the windows j
of business houses and Iroueht vigorous j
responses of an uncomplimentary cnarac
ter from those in the line.
As the negro silver club was hissed the
loudest so was it the recipient of the great
est shouts of applause. The Cook County
j Democracy Marching Club also camÂ» in
for much of the enthusiasm. Nearly
everybody in the procession carried an
American flag.
It was just before Mr. Bryan reached the
j Armory building on the lake front tnat I
I the only incident that marred the demon- ,
j stration occurred. A number of eggs were |
I thrown in the direction of his carriage
from the Metropolitan Business College,
on the fourth floor of a building situated
on the north side of Monroe street, near
the corner of Michigan avenue. None
of the missiles reached the candidate or
j his wife, but several members of the re
ception committee marching beside them
I suffered.
Daniel J. McMahon, alawver; Sol Van
Praag, a well-known First \Vard politi
cian; James Traynor and J. R. Pyne were
among those who exhibited yellow staÂ»ns
on their clothing to a reporter of the
United Associated Presses.
The spacious Armory, capable of hold
ing 10,000 people standing, had be a kept
clear by the police until the arrival of the
principal actor. A wild rush of the peo
| pie followed Mr. Bryan's entrance. 80
! quick was the charge of those anxious to
get inside that Mrs. Bryan had not time
to alight before a wild cheering mob sepa
| rated her from her husband. Sho there
lore remained in her carriage and was
driven to the Auditorium annex, where
the nominee will make his headquarters
while here.
When Mr. Bryan, cheered by the 2000
or more who had obtained entrance be
| fore him and who were seated in the gal
lery, reached the stage and had shaken
hands with National Committeeman Fa
han and other prominent Democrats who
were seated there, the doors were opened
and the outside crowd poured in. By that
time, however, many thousands of those
who had witnessed Mr. Bryan's arrival
had gone away, but those who remained
! were sufficient in number to crowd, with
{ out too much discomfort to themselves,
tue entire floor space.
Alex Jones, chairman of the Cook
County Democratic Campaign Comrritiee,
made an eloquent address of welcome 1
that was frequently cheered. He wa-s fol-
Jowe'i by Jomi Weinberg, who presented 1
Mr. Bryan with a silver star in behalf of
the Democratic Hebrew Club. Then the 1
I candidate rose and a scene that he has
witnessed so frequently in the paÂ»t thre.e
months was repeated with \igorous en
thusiasm. Many people in the audience ,
carried American Hags, and these they
waved in accompaniment to their cheers.
Hats were waved and handkerchiefs
flaunted, and for a minute or two the
building resounded with applause.
A bugler in uniform blew a call and
thus secured partial quie\ butibefore Mr.
lityan could speak there was much con
tusion caused by hisses that seemed to
proceed mainly from the gallery and 1
shouts of di-approval from the more
ardent of the Bryanites. Finally things
became still enough to let the candidate
be heard and he began his speech in a 1
voice somewhat, hoarse, but which could
be heard distinctly over the hall. His 1
speech follows:
Mr. Chairman, Fellow-citizens: I came to
Chicago as I started on my way to New York
to open tnis enmpaign and I return to your
city to take part in the closing exercises of
this campaign. I have witnessed to-day a
scene which impresses me aud leads me to be
lieve thHt this great city of the West, which
rests upon the prosperity of the great mats of
our people, which cannot prosper witnout
they prosperâ ihat this great city will cast Its
Influence one week from to-day on the side of
an American financial policy for the Ameri
can people. [Applause.]
I beg to express my deep gratitude to these
organizations which participated in this wel
come to-Uay. My friends, I an not vain
enough to believe that any part of the extra
ordinary enthusiasm whlcn I have witnessed
between the Missouri and the Atlantic Coast
is iniended as a pe'sonat tribute.
No, my irieads. I want you to believe me
when I say that in this great contest it is tne
principles for which the candidate stands and
not the candidate himself that has called
forth these demonstrations. [Applause.]
There is only one thing for which 1 cliim any
credit. I believe that you and others who
have expressed themselves as you have ex
pressed yourselves have confidence that I will
carry out the pledges which I have m tidet in
this campaign. [Applause.] It is simply your
confidence that 1 will do want I promise to do
and car ry out the idtas for which, in this
campaign, I stand, and for this only mat I can
elnim any credit.
But, my friends, what credit is it to a man
to be what he seems to be? Why, if i were
other than true to the principles which I ad
vocate I would be beneath the contempt of
those whose suffrages I ask. [Applause.] I
do believe that in this campaign a great ques
tion is to be determined, for the present, at
least; I do believe that the settlement of that
question affects every man, woman and child
iv ail this land, anu when I see the people
stirred as they have been seldom stirred be
fore, 1 believj that they appreciate the respon
sibiJitirs of citizenship and that they intend
that their ballot shall be enst for that finan
cial policy they believe to be best for them
selves, their neighbors and their country.
[Applause.]
1 appreciate, too, the kindly feeling that nas
prompted this gift from the Hebrew Democ
racy. [Applause.] Our opponents have some
times ti lea to mane it appear that when we
denounce the financial policy advocated by the
Rothschilds we are Httacking a race. We are
not, my friends. We are equally opposed to
the financial policy of J. l'ierpont Morgan as
we are to the financial policy of the Roth
schiHs. We are not attacking a race; we are
attacking greed and nvanee, which knows no
race nor religion. [Applause.] Ido not know
of any class of our people who, by reason of
their history, can better sympathize with the
struggling masses in this campaign than the
Hebrew race. [Applause.]
Whenever we have a greatcontest and when
ever right is arrayed agalust might the exam
ple of iJavid and Cioliah is always cited to give
inspiration to those who light for the truth.
l)avid conquered not beause he was strongâ
| he conquered not because of his might; fie
I conquered because he was on the right side of
I trntii, and in this contest if our Hebrew
friends will liken me to David, let me say to
them that as David triumphed because he whs
on the right side, so my only hope of victory is
in the righteousness of our cause. [Great ap
plause.]
My friends, I may be wron?. [Cries of "Xo,
no," aud cheers. ] I have never claimed infal
libility; but when I examine a question and
reach a conclusion which I believe to be right,
when I take a position winch my judgment
supports, I Â«m willing to stand by what 1 be
lieve, I care not what may happen. And in
this btruggie for the restoration of bimetal
lism theie was a time when I hnu less com
pany tlian 1 have now. [Laughter.] Your
papers call me a demagogue. [Hisses.] There
is one thing which 1 am uoi; ii is a dema
gogue.
A demagogue is defined as a man who advo
cates a thing which he does not believe, in
orderâ [varies of "Bill McKinley" and cheers.]
A demagogue is a man wuo advocates a tniug
which he does not believe in order toâ [Great
appUuse and cheering. J This audience is too
responsive. [Applause.] My friends, let me
now get through with tuat sentence. [Laugh
ter and a voice, "Ain't he a peach?" and
cheers.] iS'ow let me finish that sentence. A
demagogue is a man who advocates a thing in
order to conciliate those who dill'er from him.
[Cheers.]
A demagogue is a man who is williug to ad
vocate anything, whether he believes it or not,
which will be of advantage to him aud gain
him popularity. [Gi eat applause.]
Now, my friends, I have never advocated
during my public lift- a single thing I did not
myseli believe in. [Applause.] 1 have proven
my willingness to go down in defeat by advo
cating things when I was in a minority, and 1
have always beeu willing to accept defeat
when 1 went down with my convictions rather
than to rise by demasogueism. [Applause.] I
say that here because in this cuy the papers
are against us and we have to do our own
talking for ourselves. [Cries of "How about
the Dispatch?" and cheering.]
1 do not. mean to slight the Dispatch, but
you know thut the great bulk of the piess of
this city are against us and that we must seek
to reach the peopie directly, because we have
not the advantage that our opponents nave of
ieaching them through the daily press.
It there is anybody in this city who believes
that the free coinage of silver will be injurious
to this country he has a right and a reason for
voting agninst those who stand lor tree coin-
I age; but I do not want any person who is in
favor of the money of the constitution to be
deterred from voting for those who stand for it
i by any abuse that any of our opponents may
| use against us between now and election day.
! [Great cheering.]
I shall be in this city for a few days and
I shall see as many of your paople as it is pos
sible for me to sue in that time ; and I snail
deiend the principle for wnich I stand before
these people, and I hm going to talk to the
people themselves aud not 20 to the employer
1 and bargain for the delivery of the votes of
the people. [Great cheering.] I have been
taught to believe that the bal.ot was given to
I the individual for his own use and tnat the
I citizen who has the right to vote also has the
1 ability to dotermine how he ought to vote.
j Therefor, in this enmpaign, I want to address
; my Â«rgumentt to the individual voter and uot
to the head of a firm or the president of a rail
road or a boss of a corporation. [Wild cheer
ing and a voice, "We'll be with you Tuesday. "]
Three political parties have declared that
the money question is the paramount issue
and the bolting Democrats who are helping
the Republican ticket without having the
courage to com? out and say so have declared
tnai this money question is the paramount is
sue, and the leading Republlcrns have admit
ted it. And yet, when our opponents are
driven to the wall on the money question;
j when they have failed in their attempt to de
fend themselves before the American people,
they attempt to turn the discussion of this
campaign off from the money question and on
to other issues. [Cheers.[
But I give them notice that for one week
more they have to march up to the roonoy
question nnd tackle it. [Great applause.] In
tne past the gold standard has gained every
advantage whicli It lias thus far gained under
cover and in the dark. And in this cajnpaigu
the gold standard, having laiied before the
people, U seektntr to secure its hold upon the
American peoplo by going into power under
the cover that the Nation is in danger if those
who beliove in the Chicago platform are
elected. [Applause.] lam willing to trust to
the intelligence 01 tne American people to de
cide whetner this Government is safer in the
hands of those v/ho believe in the ability of
our people to govern ourselves or in the hands
of trusts and syndicates that have been bleed
ing tho people of this country. [Great cheer
ins?.!
I am willing to let the American people de
ci'ie whether our Government is safer in the
hands of those who believe in our form of
Government and would die to perpetrate it, or
whether it is safer in the hands of a few
financiers who cannot think on the money
question until they cable to London to find
out what they think. [Great cheering.]
Now, my friends, I only came here this
afternoon to giect you and receive your words
of welcome, and I must go now in order to be
ready lor the evening campaign.
I simply want to ask you this afternoon
to put one question to every goldbug who
comes nnd lalfcs to you, and that question is
this: You ask him why it Is, if the gold stand
ard Is a good thing, that he taiks about
"sound money" instead of "gold" when he
tnlks. [Great cheering.] Teh him thnt so
long as he is ashamed 10 use the word gold
when he talks that he need not expect you to
be ieve in the beauties of a gold standard.
[Great cheering.[
Mr. Bryan's first evening speech was
delivered 'at Arcade Hall. Six'y-lifth and
Wentworth streets, at 7 o'clock. Long
before the hour the large hall was crowded
with enthusiastic supporters of the silver
cause, and by 7 o'clock the nnrabsr nnable
to obtain a glimpse of the leather-lunged
elocutionist from the shallow river Platte
when he left the hall, was fully as great
as the crowd inside.
Mr. Bryan spoke briefly, explaining the
issue of the campaign and closed with the
assurance that the advocates of free coin
age did not desire to coerce any one, but
only wUhed each voter to study the ques
tion for himself and vote as his conscience
should dictate. "I do not want your votes
as a personal tribute," he declared, "if I
have your heart I am satisfied that your
votes v\ ill be cast as you behevo is for the
best interests of your country, and lam
content to abide the result."
The Polish school hall, where Mr. Bryan
delivered vis third speech, will hold prob
ably 1000 people when filled as it was to
night, but early in the evening the doors
were locked to prevent overcrowding, and
anotner great mass of people leathered in
the yard adjoining, and they were only
appeased by the assurance that Mr. Brvan
would show nimself there before going on
his way. Inside the rafters were lined
with clinging men and boys when Mr.
Bryan appeared, and the greeting was of
tbe most enthusiastic kind.
A laree majority of this audience was
made up of Poles, and as Mr. Bryan con
cluded dis remarks he was presented with
a b-.iuquet of sixteen white and one yellow
chrysanthemum, attached to which was
a card inscribed: '16 1. To our next
President, compliments of the Polisn
toiiers." A band of sixteen young ladies
in white and one in gold occupied the
platform and greeted nira with song.
Mr. Bryan spoke against allowing for
eign influences to predominate, and said
the people of Poland, many of whose sons
were in the audience, know the effect of
foreign domination. [Cheers and cries of
"Good."] In conclusion Mr. Bryan
warned his hearers against allowing em
ployers to influence their votes, saying
the employer had no more right to dictate
to them how they should vote than they
had to dictate to the employer how he
should vote. The fact that some employ
ers are resorting to coercion shows that
they have lostlaith in the justice of their
cans"-, and are afraid to trust the wisdom
of the people.
Inside and around the mammoth tent
at Twenty-ninth and Halstead streets
about 15,000 people were massed when Mr.
Bryan and his escort arrived, at 9:15.
The nominee was cheered heartily. So
great wa3 the rush of the crowd in his di
rection as he left the tent to go to Tatter
sail's that several of the outer poles were
carried away, and for a minute there
seemed to be danger that the immense
tented structure might collapse. Quick
work on the part of the police kept the
crowd back until the nominee had gone
and the danger was averted.
Twenty-rive thousand people were
packed in the pit and gallery of Tatter
sail's when Mr. Bryan emerged on the
small platform after a brief but exciting
struggle with a crowd outside the build
ing. This great audience was composed
mainly of men who had physical endur
ance and party spirit in sufficient quantity
to contend for seat or standing space and
then remained sweltering in the half-suf
focating atmosphere until Mr. Bryan ar
rived. The great iron arches wiiich
spanned tne seas of human laces were
fringed with men who waited for tbe
nominee in a perilous position.
Enthusiasm upon the arrival of Mr.
Bryan and at frequent intervals during
his speech was intense but not of long
duration. If McKinley men were there
they did not sbow it by auy counter dem
onstration.
Mr. Bryan was presented with a floral
horseshoe by the Horseshoers' Association
of Milwaukee. Mr. Brvan talked about
half an hour, his address being along the
lines of those delivered earlier in the even
ing.
THAT EGG INCIDENT.
It Was Probably the Pranh of a Mis
chierau* Hoy.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 27.â The egg
tlirowing incident of the Bryan parade
this afternoon has aroused considerable
indignation in Chicago, and Chief of Po
lice Badenoch took prompt action in the
matter. After the Battery D meeting,
Saul Van Praag and J. W. Murray of the
Cook County Marching Club, who were
hit by the eggs, made a complaint to the
police.
The organization of which they are
members acted as escort to Mr. Bryan in
the parade from the Union depot to Bat
tery D. While passing a building on
Michigan avenue, between Madison and
Monroe streets, three eggs were thrown
from a window of the Metropolitan Busi
ness College. One of them hit Mr. Van
Praag full in the buck, and those march
ing near him had their clothes spattered.
None of the eggs hit Mr. Bryan or came
nearer his carriage than probably ten feet.
The Chief on bearing the complaint, de
tailed fifteen men to investigate the mat
ter and offered a reward of $500 for the
apprehension of the throwers. No arrests
have been made.
It is stated that one of the tenants occu
pied by t>e business college saw a boy
probably 18 years old climbing down the
tire escape about thÂ» lime the incident
occurred. This leads to tne belief that
the occurrence was the prank of an
over enthusiastic youth.
The cotiege dismissed its pupils at 4
o'clock, and the place was deserted by the
time Chief Badenoch's men arrived on the
scene. The matter will be fully investi
gated to-morrow. The rumor was wide
spread during the afternoon that one of
the eggs had fallen in Mrs. Bryan's lap.
This is without foundation, and was prob
ably started by some persons who saw a
ball of paper fall into the seat beside the
nominee at the time the eggs were being
thrown.
LUNCH'S WILD PRATTLE.
Sayt That Republican Agents Are Jn-
timidattna the Farmer*.
MINNEAPOLIS, Itanr., Oct. 27.â E. R.
Lynch, secretary of the People's party
State Committee, makes the following
statement:
Within the past forty-eight hours I have re
ceived 500 letters from different sections of
the Stale saying that loan agents are notifying
mortgagers that in case Bryan is elected they
will promptly foreclose every mortgage as fast
as it becomes due and that insurance agents
say they will cancel all policies in the same
event.
The letters state that in every township in
the State where the farmers are heavily mort
gaged and where the silver sentiment is
strong, one of these agents can be found. The
Republicans have made a careful poll of these
townships and know who have mortgages,
when they are due, how the mortgager in
tends to vote, his nationality, whether he can
bi Influenced, etc. '
This iniormatlon is given to the agent so that
he knows how to work each person. Some he
tells that Bryan intends to deraonetizs gold,
and that there will be no gold with which to
pay gold mortgages. Ho tells others that if
Bryan is elected gold will go to a premium and
that it will take two silver dollirrs to get one
gold dollar; and, therefore, it will take twice
as many doliara to pay his mortgage if Bryau
is elected.
He pats the farmer on the back and tells
him thai nothing but pure love for the farmer
induces these bants, loan companies and in
surance companies to call on him and warn
him against danger; that these companies are
opposed to any law that would .compel the
farmer to pay them twice as many dollars as
he borrowed. Oh, you have no idea how those
soulless corporations love the dear larmerl
Tnt-y are the greatest philanthiopists In the
world. 1 fear that Jesus made a great mistake
when he drove the money-changers from the
temple. He did not know them as well as we
do, you know. If Jesus should come on earth
tc-day and call for disciples to follow him, and
preached his gospel of charity and brotherly
love, what a great rush there would hi from
the banks, corporations, mid from Hanna's
committee to be his disciples.
It will give the State to Bryan by a tremen
dous majority. It is the last grand t ffort of a
corrupt and unscrupulous party to rescue it
self from overwhelming defeat. It is a desper
ate game and will react. We will lose a few
hundred votes by it, but will ghin thousands.
It is the most appalling case of intimidation
in the history of the human race. A party
that will resort to such methods of campaign
ing should be swept from the face of the earth
forever, aud I beiieve that it will.
ARE PERMITTED TO SPEAK.
United State* Attorney*, However, Must
. .Mot , Recomtt â  Offensive. : â¢ â¢
WASHINGTON, D. iC, Oct. 27.â 1t iis
learned by inquiry at the Department of
Justice that no attempt has been made by
the Â¥ . Attorney-General \to prevent United
States ; Attorneys from making political
speeches during the present campaign,
although a number of such ' officers have
been ;" making them on both sides of the
the money question. While the Attorney-
General would prefer that t such ; officers
should not ; make speeches, vhe resolved
early in the campaign and advised vari
ous ones of 1 them who ; inquired \ that no
complaint would be" made, providing pub
lic business should not 1 * be neglected and
speaking should be in the officer's neigh
borhood where he}. 1 would not ' be " out of
reach ; that it should not be carried onto
such an extent as to be thought to inter
fere with the discharge of duty, and should
also be confined to a decorous discussion 1
of f the questions fat " issue. The various
complaints which have been received
â  irom S sound-money men i against officers
making j free-silver speeches indicate a
misapprehension of the policy of the de
partment, which has been confined to for
bidding its officers from becoming candi
dates for office or taking part as members
of committees or organizations in the man
agement or direction of the campaign.
While tho mnjori.y of attorneys have
not made such speeches, it is learned
that several are doins ao on behalf of tho
three Presidential tickets, but all, it is be
lieved, within the limits above mentioned.
WAISON'S LETTER RECEIVED.
But Senator Butler In 3'ot Anxious to
Hare It Published.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 27.â Senator
Marion Butler, chairman of the Populist
National Committee, to-niglit gave out the
following:
Mr. Watson's letter whs received Saturday
night. It had been detained in the poi-toffice
for want of sufficient postage, and I had not
been notified by tho postoffice authorities Ol
course, 1 expected Mx. Watson to give his
letter to tno public in the usual way as soon
as he had it ready.
At a recent meeting of our Executive Com
mittee at Chicago Mr. Washburu was sent by
our committee to Thomson, Ga., to confer with
Mr. Watson. On last Monday, October 19, 1 re
ceived a telegram from Mr. Washburu, sent
while he was at Mr. Watson's home Ht Thom
son, asking me not to publish Mr. Watson's
letter until I heard irom him; but that was be
fore I had received the letter.
In the meantime Mr. Washburn went to
Nashville, Term., on last Saturday for.another
conference with Mr. Watson. I \vire>l Mr.
Washburn, who hart just returned from Nash
ville, where he had had a second conference
with Mr. Watson, that the letter had been re
ceived. Mr. Washburn wired sac in reply,
asking me not to publish the letttr at present.
In the meantime I have wired to Mr. Wafson
urging the advisability of making at least one
important change in his letter. If he author
izes this change 1 will give out ihe letter.
Otherwise ho must take the responsibility of
publishing it himself. Marion Butleb.
Watched at the Vatican.
LONDON, E>-g., Oct. 27.â The Pall Mall
Gazette publishes a dispatch from its
Rome correspondent, in which he says:
The coming Presidential election in the
United States is the absorbing topic at the
Vatican, owing to the strides made by
Catholicism in America, now one of the
largest sources of income the church has.
It has recognized that the standing dan
ger to Romanism in the United States is
the independence of the American
Bishops, notably since the death of Pius
IX. Tbe latter recognized that these
Bishops enjoyed greater power than their
brethren elsewhere, and he showed he un
derstood this by his answer to some Eng
lish priests who asked for certain privi
leges. He said : "1 am, as yon say, Pope;
yet I cannot grant your request. But I
can show you a way to obtain your desire.
Go to America, lor there the Bishops are
greater than the Pope." On the ascension
of Pope Leo matters assumed a different
aspect. He charged Mgr. Satolli with the
d uty of intimating to the Bishops in un
mistakable language the limits of their
powers and the result was something like
a split, which it took Mgr. Satolli to heal.
But his mission Had good results.
The correspondent adds that the Vati
can doe 3 not wish the clergy in the United
States to take part in the campaign, lest
there should be a new division in the
ranks and an outburst of intemperate
political feeling on the part of the clergy.

In a Few Minutes the Fire
- - Spreads Through a Big
Building.
XOSS OF LIFE IS AVERTED.
Stat the Structure Is Wrecked and a
Loss of Three Hundred Thousand
Dollars Sustained.
BROOKLYN. N. V.. Oct. 27.â A disas
trous fire in Ronalds & Co.'s six-story
building on the corner of State street and
Brum place, in which there were a num
ber of narrow escapes from loss of life,
took place this afternoon. The Â£rrn are
wholesale dealers in plumbers' supplies,
and other tenants are Pay, Harman &
Cnadwick Manufacturing Company, cor-
Bet manufacturers; Lockitt & Findley and
Seymour Bros., skirt manufacturers. The
latter firms employ upward of seventy
five girls, and the fact that all got out
eafely is almost miraculous, as they were
in the upper stories.
The fire originated on the fourtn floor
from an unknown cause and spread both
upward and downward, and in a few min
utes the whole structure was a mass of
flames and thousands of people had col- i
lected in the streets near by.
The Fay, Harman & Chadwick em
ployes, about 100 in number, nearly all of
whom were girls, were in the part of the
building first attacked by the flames and
there was a great jam on the stairs and
fire-escapes, but so far as can be learned
to-night all have been accounted for.
Many of them fainted and had to be car
ried down the stairs by the firemen and
male employes.
The girls in Seymour Bros.' skirt factory
were panic-stricken when the dense smoke
began penetrating their room, and many
ran helplessly about. The employers, as
sisted by the male help, partially quieted
the girls and piloted them to the stairway
and all reached the street in safety, but
most of them without their wraps and
hats.
The fire burned five hours and com
pletely wrecked the building. The loss is
estimated at $300,000, most of which is
Ronalds & Co.'s. Fay, Harman & Chad
wick place their loss at $25,000.

He May Lose His Right
Hand.
BOSTON. Mass., Oct. 27.â John L. Sulli
van's mighty right fist has been attacked
by cancer and the entire arm is in immi
nent danger of having to be amputated.
A few days ago the pain became so severe
that he went to the Emergency Hospital

van was warned that if he did not follow
out the doctor's instructions to the letter
"the whole right arm might have to come
off.
BEAUTIFUL "AID A" PRESENTED.
Brilliant Opening of the Season of Grand
Opera.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 27.â The open
ing night of the Mapleson Academy Opera
Company turned out to be a brilliant suc
cess, both socially and artistically. The
familiar old house was filled by eu
audience that was from the first well dis
-1 . posed toward singers and performanc*.
The opera was "Aida." A little of the
inevitable nervousness inseparable from
the introduction of artists to a perfectly
strange audience was observed in Signor
Durot (Rhadames) and Mme. Bonaplata-
Ban (Aida).
Mme. Baa is worthy of praise. Her
voice carries well and is steadily sustained,
but is of a racy, pungent quality that re
quires familiarity to reconcile to its
peculiarity. She is a good actress, with
out possessing either marked individual
ity or an excessive amount of grace. Bin
boni, Mapleson's young conductor, showed
himself a master. In the second act all
the Mapleson singers did conscientious
and capable work, and the audience was
excited to a pitch of enthusiasm. So
great was the applause and so constant
that finally all the cast, with Mapleson,
the conductor and the stage manager,
f>assed across the stage. If the promise of
ast evening is fulfilled tbe public can ex
â¢ â p'ect much that is agreeable from this
opera season.
Heirs Divide the Money.
\ NEW LONDON, Cokn., Oct. 27.â The
American heirs of William Bindleas of
Kendall, England, yesterday received
their share of the estate. Palmer Bind
less of this city has been in England
several months, looking after tne in
heritance that belonged on this side of the
Atlantic, and he brought the money back
with him. The eight heirs met here yes
terday, and $141,000 was given to each.
CLAIMS OF THE BRIANITES.
False Figures Given Out by Campaign
Chairman Campttu.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 27. âChairman
Campau of the Democratic National Cam
paign Committee received to-day in reply
to instructions issued some time ago, tele
graphic reports Irom 29 Democratic State
chairmen, giving estimates as to how the
States will record their votes one week
from to-day, based on tbe latest informa
tion received by the State committees.
This is the last formal report that will be
made by the State chairmen. After com
piling the advices received Chairman
Campau made the following statement to
the United Associated Presses:
The Democratic National Committee awaits
the result of next week's election with serene
confidence. William Jennings Bryan will be
elected by the largest popular majority given
any President in a quarter of a century. He
will have more than 300 votes in the electoral
college.
Our reports from the Middle Western States
show the effect of his wonderful campaigning
tour through them. His majorities will be
increased by many thousands as a result of
his great^ journey. Illinois, Micnigan, Indi
ana, lowa and Minnesota arc absolutely safe,
and our chances of success in Ohio and Wis
consin are more than flattering.
Senator Gorman guarantees us Maryland.
Our reports from Kentucky are that Republi
can monopoly and Democratic treason will be
outvoted by more than 40.000. The desperate
and despotic effort to coerce and buy the
American people is doomed to dismal and
Humiliating failure.
The following States will give their votes
for Bryan without the shadow of a doubt-
Alabama, California, Florida, Idaho, Indiana
Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi
Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Washington
Wyoming, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia. lilt
nois, lowa, Kentucky, Mitrylnnd, Minnesota,
Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ort-pon,
South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia.
Total electoral votes, 283.
In addition to this our chances of success
in the following States are far bettor than
those of the Republicans: Delaware, Ohio,
Wisconsinâ total, 38 electoral votes.
The brag and bluster of the Republican
National Committee In claiming 350 electoral
votes Is shown in the inclusion in their esti
mates of such States as Texas, Idaho, Utah and
Montana, where the majority for Bryan can
only be measured by considering almost the
whole voting population for him.
It is time that the people understood
plainly that McKinley will not curry the
country.
Chairman Campau then gave the follow
ing reports from the State chairmen ex
actly as the messages came over the
wires:
Arkansasâ Democratic and Populist fusion
on the electoral ticket working harmoniously
and will receive at least 95,000 votes. Mc-
Kinley will not receive over 35,000. Bryan's
majority will be CO.OOO in Arkausas.
Californiaâ ln my opinion, in spite of In
timidation and coercion wnich are being
practiced in all the cities and large towns of
California to a very great extent, they cannot
prevent by any possible means the election of
the fusion electors by a majority that will not
fall below 25,000.
Colorado â Bryan and Sewall electors will
have 120,000 majority in Colorado.
Connecticutâ The Republicans are boastful,
making reckless estimates without anything
to back them. Impossible to make canvass.
Workingmen, regardless of past affiliations,
unanimous for Bryan. Republicans are count
ing McKinley buttons worn by workingmen and
basing estimates upon tbem. Workingmen
wearfMcKinley buttons to retain employment.
In one factory where the superintendent made
a canvass in a room of eighteen, tbe canvass
showea: McKinley 17, doubtful I. The way
they will vote is: Bryan 12, McKinley 5,
doubtful 1. I believe there Is a surprise in
store for the Republicans. Will elect Congress
men in the Second (New Haven) District, pos
sible one in the Fourth (Bridgeport) District.
The silver men are hopeful, while the Repub
licans are full of bluft' and bluster.
Idahoâ Bryan will carry Idaho by 18,000
majority.
Illinoisâ The corrected poll of nearly all the
counties in the State shows a substantial
gain over the first poll taken. There
seems to be no doubt of a large Demo
cratic majority in the State outside Chicago
and we are now confident of carrying that city.
Making the largest allowance for the doubtful
vote â we can count on a plurality of at least
30,000 for Bryan. We shall elect fourteen of
the twenty-one Congressmen.
Indianaâ The situation was never brighter
for a sweeping Democratic victory. I am
confident we will give Mr. Bryan the
electoral vote of Indiana; elect a Legislature
and carry nine and probably all of the
thirteen Congressional districts, besides our
State ticketâ all by a safe majority. Notwith
standing the attempts at coercion and cor
ruption, the people are loyal and determined.
All the recent alleged defections which have
been heralded by the gold-standard press
are of men allied with corporations and who
fought the silver element prior to the Chicago
convention and have given the ticket no sup
port since, so that the effect of their desertion
was long since discounted. The free-silver
Republican vote will exceed the gold-standard
vote three to oue.
Kansasâ Kansas is absolutely safe for a ma
jority for Bryan electors of not less 40,
--00 0.' State fusion ticket will also be elected.
We will elect six Congressman and good fight
ing chance for the other two. campaign is
in splendid shape.
Louisiana â Louisiana certain. Democratic
electoral ticket will receive 40,000 or 50,000
majority. Expect solid Democratic delega
tion to Congress.
Michiganâ There is no doubt that Michigan
will give its electoral vote to Bryan. Our con
clusions are based upon the following reasons:
A harmonious union of all the elements that
in all past Presidential elections have con
stituted a majority. These united forces have
constantly increased at the expense of the Re
publican party. Not a day but reports come
from every county asserting that we are stead
ily gaining new converts. A poll of
thirty counties shows twenty-eight will
give majorities for Bryan. The precincts polled
show an average of sixteen Republicans who
will vote for Bryan. If the average in the
thirty counties holds good through the entire
State it will amount to over 30.000, which
â would indicate a majority of not less than
36,000 for Bryan. This calculation assumes
that the gain from prohibition votes would
equal the vote for Palmer and Buckner. There
is no escaping the conclusion that the State is
safe for Bryan and the entire ticket.
Minnesoteâ Minnesota will give the Bryan
electoral ticket 20,000 to 25,000.
Mississippiâ The Democratic free-silver ma
jority will not be less than 75,000. Full free
silver Congressional delegation.
Missouriâ Bryan's majority in Missouri can
not be less than 05,000. The State ticket, on
which there is no fusion, may run 20,000 be
low this. The Legislature will be safely Dem
ocratic in both branches, and largely so in the
joint ballot, and will re-elect Hon. George G.
Vest lo the United States Senate. We will
elect fourteen Congressmen.
Montanaâ Montana will give the Bryan
electors at least 12,000 majority.
Nebraskaâ Our poll shows 17,000 majority in
favor of Bryan.
Nevadaâ The total vote of this State will be
10,000. The Bryan electoral ticket will re
ceive 7000 votes. Newlands will be re-elected
to Congress by an increased majority.
North Carolinaâ Electoral fusion between
Democrats, Populists and silver Republicans
is complete in North Carolina, which will re
ceive a majority for Bryan of 30,000 at least.
North Dakotaâ Xortn Dakota will be for
Bryan by 3000 on a conservative estimate,
based on a full poll of ths State. There are
not to exceed 2000 gold Democrats in
the State, while there are fully 5000
silver Republicans, many of them prominent
leaders; will also elect Congressmen and a
full fusion State ticket, with almost a certain
ty of carrying the Legislature and electing
Utii'ed States Senator. In the Legislative tight
the Republicans have a majority of twelve
of holdover State Senators, but their corrupt
legislative record, with overwhelming silver
sentiment among the farmers, will give us a
majoiity.
Oregonâ Oregon Is safe for Bryan at from
3000 to 4000â a very consecvative estimate.
Republican claims are largely exaggerated.
South Carolinaâ This State will give Bryan a
majority of at least 50,000. All Democratic
candidates for Congress wil 1 be elected.
South Dakotaâ We are confident this State
will give Bryan electors 5000 to 8000 ma
jority.
Texasâ From the information obtainable
the Bryan and Sewafl electors will have
a clear majority of 150,000 over Mc-
Kinley. Tnere is no possible combination
that can defeat Bryan and Sewall in Texas, all
reports to the contrary notwithstanding. This
estimate is based on a careful and conservative
poll of the State.
Utahâ Bryan will carry this State by 40,000
majority. King, the Democratic candidate for
Congress, surely elected. Will elect Demo
cratic Legislature.
Vireiniaâ Virginia is safe for Bryan by a
handsome majority.
Washingtonâ Washington will give Bryan
at least 15,000.
Wyomingâ Wyoming will give Bryan not
less than 1800 majority, and It may reach
3000. The Hanna managers are using des
perate efforts to buy and steal the State, but
they cannot buy and steal enough to reduce
the majority below the above mentioned
figures. Ex-Governor Osborne will be elected
to Congress over Mondell, the present Con
gressman, without doubt.
Floridaâ There is no donbt whatever that
the vote of Florida will be for Bryan and
Sewall by a majority of from 10,00 to 15,000.
West Virginiaâ We will carry West Virginia
for Bryan and the entire State ticket by from
8000 to 10,000 majority, and will certainly
elect three and probably all the Democratic
candidates for Congress.
Marylandâ Our campaign is exceedingly
warm, and we are more than satisfied with the
progress we have made.
ARE THE THIS DEMOCRATS.
Sentiments of Palmer and Bnekntr Fx-
pr*s**d at Omaha.
OMAHA, Nebr , Oct. 27.â Senator John
M. Palmer and Simon B. Buckner, candi
dates respectively for President and Vice-
President on the National Democratic
ticket, arrived here at 11 o'clock this morn
ing from Council Bluffs.
They were met by a delegation of gold
Democrats and escorted to a hotel, where
they rested until evening. To-Dight the
Presidential nominee addressed an au
dience of 2000 people and was received
with considerable enthusiasm.
Senator Palmer asserted that the true
Democracy in convention assembled at
Indianapolis was upholding the time
honored principles of the party which had
been sourned by a convention assembled
under the name of "Democracy" at
Chicago.
He scored the free silver Democrats and
said that the principles of the party would
he upheld by the courageous ones who
stand for National honor to-day.
General Buckner followed with a review
of the party since. Jefferson, discussing the
arguments of Mr. Bryan and free silver
advocates at considerable length.
The audience was largely composed of
Republicans, who cheered the mention of
McKinley's name and the arguments for
sound money liberally.
R. B. Robb, gold nominee for Governor,
spoke briefly.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1896.
"KID" LAVIGNE
IS THE VICTOR,
Gets the Decision From
Everhart After a
Hot Fight.
Twenty-Four Fast and Furious
Rounds Boxed by the So-Called
Lightweights.
STOPPED BY THE REFEREE.
But the New York Police Were in At
tendance to Prevent a Possibe
Knockout.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 27.â The arena
of the Bohemiam Sporting Club was filled
to its utmost capacity to-night to witness
for the first time in this club a champion
ship contest â that between "Kid" Lavigne
and Jack Everhart of New Orleans. There
were three events on the programme.
The first bout was a six-round affair at
122 pounds between Jack Delaney and
Jack Burge. At the end of the sixth
round the referee awarded Delaney the de
cision.
David Wall and Jerry Reedy at 112
pounds were the next pair to appear.
Reedy, who is a novice, was simply a
punching-bag for Wall, and his antics
created much merriment. In the fourth
round he shouted, "He couldn't knock me
out with a sledge hammer." Wall con
tinued his punching in the last two rounds
and easily won the decision.
The purse hung up was $3500 and the
prices charged for admission, $30, $20 and
$10, kept the class of spectators, very
select. This was the second meeting be
tween Everhart and Lavigne. At Coney
Island they fought a twenty-round battle
two years ago, when Lavigne got the deci
sion.
The betting to-night was $1000 to $700 on
Lavigne, who has improved wonderfully
since that time. To-nlgnt's contest was
advertised as being for the "light-weight
championship of the world," but the
weights at which the men fought precludes
any such conclusion; besides, Jack Mc-
AuHffe undoubtedly holds the light-weight
championship.
Just before the bout Police Commis
sioner Andrews and Acting Inspector
Harley arrived. It was understood from
the Commissioner that he was present to
see how far the Horton boxing bill provi
sion operated in an important glove con
test of this kind, but that the Inspector
was there to prevent a "knockout."
Just before the men shook hand La
vie ne's party registered one bet of $5000 to
$2500 on their man.
Lavigne entered the ring at 10:25, ac
companied by Sam Fitzpa:nck. He was
quickly followed by Everhart and Charley
White at 10:30.
The betting was in favor of Lavigne at
big odds. A few offered even money that
Lavigne would win in ten rounds. "Hon
est John" Kelly was referee. The men were
to fight twenty-five rounds at 138 pounds,
and it was announced that both had
weighed in under the limit. At 10:40
they shook hands.
Round Iâ The Kid landed on the body and
Jack on the head. Alter a lively rally Jack
forced the Kid to the side of the ring. Ever
hart missed with the leit, but Lavigne ran in
a right on the jaw. The Kid put a straight left
on the chest and repeated it with a good left
on the eye. Everbart landed on the Kid's
wind, and a clinch followed.
Round 2â LaviKue lauded on the chest. Jack
swung wildly and the Kid punched him right
and left on the stomach.' The Kid landed a
Rood right on the neck, receiving one on the
jaw, and then got home heavily with his left
on the body and bis right on the ear. ' Body
blows were exchanged as the Kong sounded.
Round 3â Lavigne opened with two straight
lefts on the mouth and received a stinger on
the jaw. Jack whipped his right into the wind
and George retaliated with a good left on the
ribs and right on the chest. Another straight
left from Lavigne followed on Jade's chest,
and another, and still a third in the same
place.
Round 4â The Kid rushed, and Jack caught
him on the jaw with a left. In the mix-up hot
work was done by both, and Everhart put a
terrific right on the jaw of his man. They ex
changed lefts, and Jack staggered with two
hard right swings on the car. Another smash
from the Kid's left sent Jack wobbling.
Round sâ Lavigne opens hostilities with a
left on the jaw and then the left on the head,
and Jack clinches. The Kid swlugs left and
right on ear and head, and Jack reaches the
Kid's jaw with a ieft, but it lacked force.
After a smash on the ear Jack looks weary,
but put a good left on the jaw. Lavigne upper
cut him u3 the round closed.
Round (i â They clinched at start. Jack
jabbed with his right on the chest and the
Kid beat a tattoo with right and left. Lavigne
ducked an awful smash from Everhart and at
close quarters hammered away at Jack's body.
Just as the bell rang the Kid landed two
straight lefts.
* Round 7â Jack put his left on the Kid's
jaw. Lavigne then banged Everhart three
times with his left on the face and Jack
clinched. The Kid uppercut viciously twice
with the left, receiving one on the jaw in re
turn. They exchanged rights on head and
body as ihe round closed.
Round Bâ Jack opened with a good left on
the head aud the Kid reached the body. La
vigne landed on the jaw, sending Jack's head
back. Everhart played for head and the Kid
smashed him time and time again.
Round 9â Lavigne ducked' into a left on the
jaw, but pounded Jack on the ribs. The Kid is
putting in telling work and Everhart staggers
and is all but gone when the gong sounds.
Round 10â Everhart comes up smiiinÃ and
looking fresh after the awful punishment.
Lavigne goes right at the body and Jack for
the head, but clinches when it gets too warm.
The Kid lands three awful leits and catches
Jnck full on the jaw. He staggers against the
referee as the gong rings.
Ronnd 11â Everhart lands right and left
lightly on the head and receives three in the
same place. Jack swings his left on the ear,
but was nearly floored with two swinging lefts
on the jaw. He receives a straight right and
left on the head aud two more on the jaw as
the round ends.
Round 12â Everhart swings on the ribs.
They are slugging each other terrifically,
Everhait showing that he is a glutton for
punishment. He puts his right on Lsvigne's
wind and takes a bad left on the jaw. Ever
hart looked glad when the gong sounded.
Round 13â .Everhart op^nn with a left on
the jaw and swings his right to the same
place, receiving two on the ribs In return.
Three times Lavigne gets in on the body and
head. A hot rally and hot exchanges follow.
Everliart looks dazed but is still in it.
Round 14â The Kid opens with a left on
the ribs, taking a right on the jaw in return.
Everhart rushes Lavigne to the ropes and
lands riÃht and left on the head. The Kid
lands a hard one on the ribs, following it up
with a perfect voiley of blows. Everhart is
standing punishment well.
Round 15-Everhart uppercuts the Kid with
terribie force. It is hammer and tongs, and
Jack gets iv heavily on the face with tne left.
They slug at long range with honors even, but
Lavigne gets in a good left on the chest at the
end.
Round 16â Everhart puts in a good right on
the jaw, but the Kid whipped his right in
Jack's face four limes. Jack clinches con
stantly, but gets In an uppercut as the round
closes. A tame round.
Round 17â Everhart opens with a hard left
on the ear, receiving one on the ribs in return.
A brisk rally follows, and Jack lands wiih
right and left on the jaw and ear, the Kid
meanwhile planting bkiw after blow on the
head with the left and hard swings on the
jaw with the right as the bell ends it.
Round 18â The Kid ducks clumsily for a left
and Jack pastes him twice on the jaw. La
vinge runs into a straight left, but comes back
with right and left on tne head. Two more
smashes from the Kid's left and Everhart is
grogsy for a moment, but recovering gets
home with the right on the face three times.
The pace is telling on both.
Round 19 -A few good exchanges, but lots of
clinching and the referee's cry "break" be
comes monotonous. Jack is back with right
and leit swings on the face. The bell was a
welcome sound to both.
Round 20â The New Orleans man Is nearly
downed with a right swing on the ear; another
right swing staggers him once more, but the
next moment he is dancing around and lands
a left on the jaw. .Everhart was very tired at
the end.
Round 21â Everhart jabs with left and
they clinch. A hot exchange follows.
The Kid bangs the raw spot on Everhart's ribs
time and time again. He lands on Jack's jaw
twice and Everhart reels again. As the gong
rang Everhart was only prevented from falling
by Lavigne's glove against his head.
Round 22 â They came together with
lefts on the jaw and the Kid shoots his
left three times on the head. A mix up follows
and then the Kid put three straight lefts on
the face. Everhart was still able to swing a
light left on the head as the gong sounded.
Round 23â The Kid swings right on Ever
hartls ear, and the latter upper-cuts with
right, but Lavigne plunged his left three timts
in the face ana ripped his right into Jack's
wind pitilessly. Jack clinches hia man to
keep from falling. Three more body blows
from Lavigne and Jack makes only feeble
efforts to reply. They clinch ana Lavigne is
holding Everhart up at the end of the round.
Round 24â An exchange of right? and the
Kid ducks into an upper-cut. Then Lavigne
resumes his banging on the head and ribs. A
right swing on the jaw sends Kverhart reeling
and another straightens him up. A third one
staggors him again, when the referee jumped
between them and stopped the bout, award
ing the fight to Lavigne, after one minute and
and iifty-Uiree seconds of the twenty-fourth
round.
Everhart took punishment enough to
have finished a half dozen men, and his
frequent recoveries were astonishing.

Fresno County lrouble.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 27.â Serious trouble
is brewing in the oil wells in western
Fresno County. The fields, which are
certain to be productive of much wealth,
were located by Fresno, Tulare and Vi
salia capitalists under the provisions of
the mineral land law. In August of this
year Hoke Smith ruled that petroleum
lands were not mineral lands. Possessors
of oil fields disregarded Smith's ruling,
and now certain persons have tiled home
steads on lands referred to.
The feeling against the trespassers is
very, bitter, and the original locators say
that they will forcibly repel all interlopers
and if necessary will apply the torch to
every well in the district. Many thou
sands of dollars have been invested by
original locators, and much petroleum is
now being shipped to Los Angeles. The
matter will at once be taken into the
couÂ»ts and a long and costly litigation will
follow.
Xapa Stag* Wrecked.
NAPA, Ual., Oct. 27.â While coming
down the grade between Napa and Monti
cello to-day the brake of a stage gave way,
and the horses were soon beyond the con
trol of the driver. After runnine about
naif a mile they went over an embank
ment. There was only one passenger,
Spencer Wilcox, aboard. He fortnnatoly
fell so that the stage cleared him and was
uninjured. Jeff Smelser, the driver, was
badly bruised. The stage was completely
wrecked.

several selections early in the evening.
The Chautauqua Hall on Seventeenth

and the address of the brilliant ediior was
delivered in the Portuguese language.
The speaker said he was opposed to the

forth were unsound and dangerous and
would work incalculable injury to the
whole people of the republic. To prevent
hereafter undue reaction against whole

Interment
PORTLAND, Or , Oct. 27.â Editor Hay
den of the Catholic Sentinel this after
noon received a letter from a priest at
Mount Angel, a few miles from here, an
nouncing that Mrs. Mary Dickenson of
that place had a narrow escape from being
buried alive last Saturday afternoon.
On Friday last the announcement of me
death of Mrs. Dickenson was made. The
funeral had been arranged for Sunday
afternoon Trom tbe Catholic church in
Mount Angel. .
The congregation had assembled, the
pall was spread lor the coffin, and the
priest and the servers awaited the arrival
of the funeral procession.
After so long a delay as to warrant ap
prehension that something unusual had
occurred, the priest sent a messenger to
urge haste. The messenger met another
from the Dickenson household who told
the causa of the delay.
When the undertaker put the hd on to
the coffin the consequent suffocation had
aroused the supposed corpse, and Mrs.
Dickenson awoke from a trance. When
the letter was written Mrs. Dickenson was
alive, with every prospect of many years
of life before her.

"Realizine thax I had been set down as

shore, "and that when we got outside,
where to resent any kind of ill treatmen t
is mutiny, the officers would improve their
opportunity to get even by subjecting

what little I had coming to me would be

termined to leave her.
"Accordingly I slipped off my shoes,

started for shore. It was a long swim and

TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 27.â The steamer
Amarapoora, 1619 tons. Captain Cameron,
arrived this afternoon, after experiencing
one of the stormiest voyages ever encoun

kong via Kobe was twenty-one days
making the passage from the Japan port.
When three days out from Kobe it en
countered a typhoon, which lasted seven
days. The steamer was forced to ran her
engines at half speed. Heavy seas swept
over it, smashing the skylight aft, and
great volumes of water poured into the,
cabin. Its ballast shifting, the vessel
listed to starboard. The edge of the deck
was under water, and she was often forced
to lie to. The Amarapoora will take on a
cargo of flour, lime and coffins from Ta
corua for Central America.

iJATTLF.-SniP Oregon, >
Monterey Bat, Oct. 27. )
To be ready for an official inspec
tion soon to be made by a board of
naval officers yet to be appointed, the
United. States battle-ship Oregon, Captain
Henry L. Howison commanding, sud
denly weighed her anchor last Sunday
morning, passed down San Francisco Bay,
pushed her great white prow through the
Golden Gate and put to sea for a practice
cruise. There was, perhaps, not a man
aboard who was not glad of it. The Ore
gon had been hugging the shore so long in
San Francisco Bay that, as an able sea
man put it. there was some danger of the
crew becoming "landlubbers."
The Oregon bad been preparing for a
week to get underway. Captain Kowison
had had her drifting and making short
trips around the bay, compensating her
compasses and completing other necessary
preliminaries. Tne crew had been expect
ing to put to sea for a week. "When at last
the captain decided to heave anchor Sun
day morning, in view of the favorable
weather, it took about thirty secondsfor
the word to be gladly passed over the ship,
from the lookout's perch in the conniiig
tower 10 the orlop deck. Even the water
ballast, away down next to the sea itself,
gurgled itÂ» j"oy.
The crew sprang to its duties with alac
rity. The scene aboard was one of unusual
activity. A man with a spyglass ashore
might have thought the Oregon was pre
paring for action. A whisper by Lieuten
ani-Commander and Executive Officer E..T.
Drake on the bridge seemed to penetrate
all the hatchways and be heard even in
the forehold. The gangways, the pro
peller and lower booms, on which so many
' admiring visitors have climbsd aboard
the ship, were quickly unshipped and
stored away. Water-tight shutters were
dragged out for the hatchways, iron buck
lers were made fast over the portholes of
the big guns, and the guns themselves
were swathed in sleeves and hoods as ten
derly as an infant ashore is wrapped up
lor a cruise thiough ihe park with a pretty
nurse for a propelier. They were then
coated with Albany grease, so they would
not rust on being lashed by any bold wave
of a furious sea. The steam cranes amid
ships picked up tne steam-cutters and
small boats irom the water, as tliougU
they were so many chips, and deposited
them softly in their cradles on the s-uper
structure. At 9:45 the anchor was clear,
and with three stentorian blasts on her
ruellow whistle, and Captain Howison's
gr.rn vitaee peering occasionally from the
iorwan.l bridge, she moved.
"Sing hoy, our first cruise," was shouted.
The ship which male a maximum speed
of 17.34 knots on her trial trip, the ship
which in the theater of naval construction
made tne Cramps change their seats irom
the orchestra chairs to the gallery, the
iinest and most Jormidable battle-ship in
the world, was under way.
When passing the flagship Philadelphia
the guard was paraded and all men not
bu*y stood at attention.
It was noon when the Oregon passed out
the gate. Great booies move slowly. She
seemed to creep down the bay. Tne fer
ries Oakland and Newurk saluted. The
. crowds on their decks rushed to the raiis
to see the stately spectacle of the Oregon
under way. And it was a stately spectacle.
Her white hulk, emblematic of peace, the
cavernous, c!ark and frowning muzzles of
her great guns, eloquent of war, tumult
and destruction even in their silence; the
' white turrets almost contradicting nature
in their indestructibilityâ a monsier en
gine of combat embodying the latest in
struments of annihilation that science and
skill could devise â slowly she swept on by
the defenseless rxerchantmen, at once
their protector and their destroyer, white
omnipotent among them.
She sailed straight out to sea. Nobody
knew whither the Oregon was bound â no
body but one man. lie had not told and I
nobody dared ask him. It is a capital i
crime almost for anybody to be inquisi
tive aboard a man-of-war except a land
lubber. There were all kinds of guesses as I
to where she would finally drop anchor.
The weather was cool and cioudy and a i
gentle breeze came along from the* south
southwest. She steamed straight west for
an hour and then straightened away to
â  south. Then the guessing began in earn
â  eat. One suggested Santa Barbara Chan
nel as the destination, as that affords a
' suitable ranee to try the big guns. A ju
nior officer having pleasant recollections
' .ashore of the water carnival and the sum
mer girl in her bathing-suit mentioned
Monterey Bay. Several wise marines and
prophetic tars winked knowingly, whis
pered Callao or Guayaquil, where the big
tire was, or Chile, where the girls run the
streetcars and the climate is much like
that of California.
A naval cadet, one of the bright and
ambitious young men provided Dy An
napolis to be the captains, the commo
dores and the admirals <rt the future, saw
some connection between the recent de
parture of the French man-of-war from
" San Francisco for Guayaquil and the cruise
of .the Oregon and sniffed war afar off.
He thoueht the Oregon might be heading
for Guayaquil to stand by and look serious,
the latter not a very difficult thing for the
Oregon to do.
Meanwhile the Oregon kept on a straight
coursD to the south. The sphinx-like com
mander paced tiie bridge and the land on
u.e port side did not disappear until it
passed from sight into the night. She
was steaming under two boilers and mak
ing about seven knots an hour all day.
There was plenty of time a head ana pienty
of provisions and coal aboard and noocca
t-iou for hurrying. The weather con
tinued cool and cloudy all day, with a
lfttht southwest breeze and a smooth seu.
it being Sunday the day was uneventful.
There were no drills or exercises to speak
of, except ihe recular morning and even
j'lf; mustering and inspection at quarters.
Ihe rollcall showed that notwithstanding
the fact that there are over 150 landsmen
on board who, like the Oregon, had never
made a cruise to ?ea before nobody had
iiailen over the rail.
â  The Or gon rode the sea steadily. No
â  how big a ship is or now heavy she
Vuay be she will roll some on the lone
ftt-avy swells of old ocean. The ship
nee:ed over occasionally to an angle of five
degrees, but the pendulum in the pilot
house usually indicated from one to three
.decrees. The Oregon may roil over to
ihirty degrees and still be in no danger of
capf^n^ but beyond thirty degrees vis
ions of what happened to the -good ship
Blairmore in Mission Bay might ariÂ«Â«e.
On account of the recently adjusted
compasses, the proximity of the shore
and the fact of the ship being a new one
on her first cruise, the night was one of
unusual and continued vigilance on the
part of the officer on drck. Captain How
ison, who looks a typical seadog In wet
weather harness, got about an hour's sleep
during the night. The midnight stroller
was likely to run up against Executive
Officer Drake anywhere above or bHow
the berth deck, while the light of Lieu
tenant and Navigator Hughes gleamed
like a beacon all night lo:ig in the chart
room high on the conning tower, just
abaft the wheel house.
At 7 o'clock Sunday nieht the Oregon
was abreast the lights of Pigeon loint,
where the steamship Colombia wont
ashore one foggy morning last June.
On Monday morning the sun rose in a
clear sky and looked down on a smooth
and smiling sea. There was a long sweil
from windward, with the oreeze slightly
freshening from the southwest.
1 iie main object of this cruise is to make
the crew familiar wiih its duties. The
captain gave orders yesterday to get down
to business. The muster and inspection
at quarters takes place every morning and
evening. About 10 o'clock yesterday gen
eral quarterj were sounded. This is the
assembling of all men to their proper
positions ready for action in goin* to bat
tle. The magazines were unlocked and
men darted down into their cavernous
depths far belov,- the waterline. The pas
sageways, the steam elevators the trol
leys for carrying the heavy shells and
other ammunition were quickly manned,
the gunners and the gunners' mates
jumped to their stations, ammunition was
passed up and the ship was a scene of war
between all decks from the bridge to the
keelson and from stem to stern. When
the Oregon goss into battle and the great
guns and the little guns, the saber?, the
cutlasses and the torpedoes show the ter
ror that their throats and flashing biades
now conceal, the crew wili come to quar
ters just as it did then.
The 13 - inch guns forward ana aft,
the 6 and 5-inch guns amidships, the
6-pounders on the superstructure and
the 2-pounders on the conning tower
were manned and maneuvered. 'I.he thir
teen-inch turrets in which the men that
man them are concealed and which weigh
900 tons were swung in all directions.
Tney aro moved I y hydraulic power. The
turning of a small wheel on the inside
swings them from port to starboard aud
back apain, swinging athwartships as re
sponsive and steady to the touch as the
ship's propellers are to the levers in the
engine-room. Men in the hoods on the
top of the turrets look through the peep
holes ami aim the big guns. Aloft on the
bridge are rance-fuiders with telescopes
who find the range of another ship or
whatever object may be shot at, and tele
phone it to the turrets. There are tele
p ones all through the Oregon, even in
places that seem hardly accessible.
The 8-inch ami G-inch guns are
turned by steam. These guns sweep all
points of the compass and horizon. The
13 - mcii guns, almost capable of
blowing Spain off the map at a simul
taneous discharge, were swung around
until their muzzies were directly beiow
I these of the 8-inch guns a Jittle ior
] ward of amidships, tht gun's being at rieht
| angles to each other, showing tne possi
bility of an awfui crossfire.
The first divisional drill took place yes
terday. In this the men are drilled in
infantry tactics. Th -re are about 500 men
aboard the Oregon and about 80 per cent
of them are muster* din this drill. Even
the Chinese cooks and waiters and the
coal parsers are armed with Springfield
rifles and taught how to use them.
While the Oregon was heeling gently to
a long swell at 11:15 o'clock there was a
cry of "Man overboord." If there is any
thing that produce.-* a sensation at sea it
is that cry. Instantly the main deck and
the superstructure decks and the balus
trade before the water tight doors were
full of men rushing from their quarters on j
board. Officers piled up out of thehaich- ]
ways af:.
The figure of a man could be seen bob- !
bing on the waves astern. The officer w:>s i
on the after bridge. He cried an order to I
man the starboard lifeboat swinging to its j
davits nearly amidship, and there was a
rush to the lifeboat. The engines were
ordered stopped. The life buoy was lÂ«*t
go when the body floated opposite it. It
louled somewhat and did not drop at the
time it should, it followed perhaps 100
feet behind ti.e floater.
The lifebuoy has two torches which
burn calcium phosphate, which ignites
when it comes in contact with the water.
The torches aro for use particularly when
there is a man overboard at night. When
the ship was slowed uown the lifeboat
was lowered, and went into the water
without loss of time. The crew, in com
mand of Naval Cadet Rabe, rowed for dear
life for the unfortunate floater. He was
picked up in exactly 8 minutes 50 seconds j
after the cry of "Man overboard." Consider- |
ins the fact that this was the first time the
lifeboat was manned, and by a greeu crew,
j the time is said to be excellent.
Toe Oregon was backed astern. It re
quires some lime to stop the momentum
of a 12,000-ton ship. In sixteen minutes
the ship was under way again. The man
overboard was a dummy created by Naval
Cadet Johnson, who pitched it headlong
into the sea. It was a device forgiving
thÂ« crew practice. The torches, on the re
covered buoy could not be extinguished
by water. They had to burn themselves
out.
During the day infantry, saber, setting
up, calisthenics, signal, battery and col- j
Hsion drills were executed. These and
others will be had every day during the
cruise.
The Oregon went through an unusual
I and curious performance yesterday after
' noon. This was a turning \rial for the
purpose of determining the tactical diam
eter of the ship. Her helm was put bard
| over and she steamed in a circle. Boxes
| were pitched into the sea to mark the
i starting-point. The idea of this wr.s to
n:id the diameter of the circle in which
the ship could turn, information very ne
cessary in case of an engagement. The
wake of the ship showed that she made
two complete circles joining each other,
and composing the figure 8. The diame
ter of ths circle is determined by the dis
tance the log shows its circumference to
be.
The weather having been exceedingly
favorable for all the drills and maneuvers,
the captain concluded to put back on his
cour&e. He concluded to leave the firing
of the bie and little guns to the board of
inspectors when it shall come aboard.
There was a shade of disappointment at
this. Everybody wanted to hear the thun
der of the 13-inch giants and the crack of
the 6-ponnders. But it coits something to
shoot thoÂ«e guns. It costs about $500
each, or $2000 to shoot the four 13-inch
guns once.
Each torpedo costs $2500. To shoot the
entire complement of forty-two guns of
the Oregon and fire the "live torpedoes
only once would cost Uncle Sam $15,930.
When abreast of San Luis Obispo the
Oregon straightened away on a north
ward course, bound, the crew did not
know where. At 3 o'clock yesterday lifter
noon the wind began to freshen, occa
sionally shifting from the south-southeast
to the west-southwest. At 6 o'clock it
was a smoky sonthwester with fog and the
wind stiffening. The sea beean to rise
and the rain fe!l in squalls. The Oregon
plowed steadily on, her nose parting the
great waves and the foam rushing from
her bows 100 yards over the sea. She
pitched some. The opportunity had
come to see how she would behave in
rough weather. The captain was on the
br:dee. The seamen in their weather
clothes and hats made a weird picture
passing in and out nf the li-hts and
shadows of the decks. The wind whistled,
the seu roared and the big guns bobbed
defiance at the big waves. The captain
missid his dinner. Lieutenant Rooney
braved the weather during the first watch
irom the forward bridge.
Durine'the mid and morning watches
Ensign Durell and Er.sizn Eberle were on
deck. The weather continued squally all
night. Captain Howison was on deck
fortv-cight hours since the ship left San
Francisco, with the exception of about two
hours. He said to-day:
"I did not remain on deck either from

lack of confidence in the ship or in the
men. But the Oregon is a new ship and
had never sailed this course. I was not
anxious at all. The next time I sail this
course I can' go to bed and go to sleep.
The ship has behaved splendidly all the
way."
At 8 o'clock this morning the Oregon
dropped anchor in 'Monterey Bay. As
Â»he was swinging to the anchor the heavy
seas caught her oroadside on. She heeled
a few times to an angle of 13 degrees.
The Oregon may reach San Francisco
Friday or Saturday.

The Olympic Club hns been granted a
permit by the Health a-ul Police Commit
tee of the Board of Supervisors to givÂ»* a
boxing entertainment iÂ» Dei-enibsr. W.
J. KenneJy, the superintendent of the
Olympic Ciub, has the matter in charge,
and douotless he will select only nrsi-c'ass
fistic talent Jor thiÂ», the second profes
sional bcxing entertainment which will be
given uti.ier the auspices of the club.

probability the entertainment would be

ter parrot December. Tne superintendent
could not, at this early hour, say who will

PACIFIC UNION CLUB.
Money* Will Be Ita'ned to Carry Out the
â¢ ' Van > ims Avenus Enterprise.
A general meeting of members of the
Pacific Union Club was held last evening
to hear the report of the committee ap
pointed to raise by bond subscription the
sum of $325,000. Eighty or more mem
bers attended and E. W. Hopkins, presi
dent of the club, presided. It was decided
to extend the time for final decision on
the proposition to build a new clubhouse
until December 1. ,
The sentiment in favor of a new club
house on Van Ness avenue is very strong.
The indications are that the required
money will be raised in due time.
The special committee having in charge
the auty of procurinc tt^p necessary sub
scriptions for the enterprise will report
again on December 1.
Tuo inference that the money will be
raised comes from the fact that several
prominent capitalists who subscribed lib
erally to build a new house on Union
square have renewed thÂ«*ir subscriptions
to the Van Ness avenue project.

John H. Harney. Ed B. Smith, Charles
Mayers, Frank Benson and others devoted
the ten nnnntes allotted to them in eulo
gistic terms of the magnificent record
made by Mr. Eider as street expert of this
City. Between the speeches the Sunset

warm applause. A resolution was unani
mously adopted urging the election of

Streets, on the ground that he is honest,
efficient and thoroughly competent.

PORTLAND CROOK
COMES TO GRIEF
Ezra Durand Arrested for
Forgery in South
Africa.
Sold to British Capitalists a
Mine That He Did
Not Cwd.
HIS CAEEER ON THIS COAST.
Fiei After Defraud rg Oregon People
Out of Sevrnty-Five 'Jh usani
Dollars.
rORTLAN'D.On , Oct. 27â Ezra Durand,
who fied from here in 1892, lias turned up
! i:i Cape Town, South Africa, where, after
pursuing nil scoundrelly tactics for a few
months, he fell into the hands of the
police and is now in prison.
Durand came to Portland in the '80's
and established an agency for the sale of
organs and pianos. He was a fat, sleek
man, with an oily tongue, and was an ar
i dent church member. He succeeded in
j building ut> a very large business, and in
a comparatively short time won the confi
dence of many wealthy people, from whom
he borrowed large sums of ensh or obtained
their indorsements to promissory notes.
j Early in 1892 it leaked out that Durand
i had been engaged in some losing specula
| tions, and that his legitimate business had
i greatly suffered and deciined in conse
quence. Ttiis rumor was not long in
spreading, and Â«men Durand heard that a
tornado was gathering about his sleek old
I head he disappeared.
From that day to this his victims have
been unable to >:et a clew to him, notwith
! standing some clever detective talent was
I enlisted to capture him. It is estimated
! that lie had defrauded his victims out of
! $75,000.
The advices from Souh Africa stale
i that Durand is in a Cape Town prison
i awaiting British just'ce to be meted out
to him for a gisantic mining fraud, in
which another American named William
Blessing was implicated. This transaction
was engineered b}' means of iorged
! papers, which Durand and his conted
eraie hart transmitted to a London syndi
' cnte, with which they were negotiating
j for the sale of valuable mining property
in the interior, to which they hail not a
tithe of title. The British investors sent
out two mining experts and one of their
members to inspect the property. The
result j, roved satisfactory and Durand and
Blessing were given Â£'JO,OOOas an advance
upon the sal^ of the property. On the
I night the. two swindlers were about to sail
I for Southampton they were taken off the
I steamer and locked up for forgery and
other crimes in connection with this deal.
: How the forgery came to light just in the
nick of time is not disclosed.
FIGHTING DELEGATE.
Violent Attack Made Upon President J.
J. Barrstt of the Bakers'
Union.
J. J. Barrett, 123 Clara street, president
of the Bakers' Union, swore to two com
plaints in Jndgo Conlan's court yesterday
charging "John Doe" Dougherty with
battery and threats against life.
There has bsen some trouble in the shop
where President Barrett is employed. A
f -w days ago Doughertv, who is a stranger
here, went to him and wanted to be en
gaged to "do up the other fellows." His
overtures were rejected and he went to
the other side and was, according to Bar
rett, engaged by them as a delegate to "do
him up" on the strength of getting a job
if SUCCrSSfUi. "
Early Monday morning, while Barrett
and an assistant were working in the
bakeshop getting out the morning's bread,
Dougherty made his appearance and care
fully locked the door. He is a big. power
ful iellow and after notifying Barrett that
he was there to "do him up," according to
Barrett, he made a pass at him with his
list. The blow was dodged and he tried
two or three times more to land upon Bar
rett, but wai each time foiled.
Barrett stood his attacks as lone as his
patience lasted, but thinking it was time
! to defend himself he, as Dougherty made
I a rush at him, jabbed him in the neck
with a knife. The sight of blood was too
I much forDousherty and he beat a retreat,
| but not before he had threatened to return
l and make another attempt to 'do" Bar-
I rett '"up."

ASKING FOR VOTES.
The Point Lobog Improvement Club
Kntertains Many Political Can
didates.
It was the Point Lobos Improvement
Club's evening at homo last nig tit. It
kept open hou*e, so to speak, on Fifth
avenue, near Clement, and President
George R. Fletcher and Secretary W. P.
Johnson took the part of host. The club
members had invited the numerous can
didates for political offices to meet wiih
them, ami the invitation was eagerly ac
cepted by those who want the votes of the
R chmonditps.
For hours t lie tide of office-seekers was
to the west, and for hours the eathering
in the hall sat patiently and listened to
the promises that fell from the lips of the
speakers.
On several occasions rival candidates
met on the platform and they took occa
sion, metaphorically speaking, to throw
bouquets at each other.
Even the Socialist Libor party's candi
dates were there, and their nddresses were
a revelation to those not familiar w.th the
Socialistic doctrine of political economy.
Following were the candidates who spoke
and the positions to which they aspire:
I). A. Macdonaid, Superintendent of Streets;
A. T. Barnett, Justice of the Peace; James
liritt, Suji-rvisor Ninth Ward; James L,
Halsted, Ssnool Director; J. C. Bunner,
City and County Surveyor; J. A. CÂ«r

IMPORTANT QUESTION.
Shall Bryan Votes on Democratic
and PocuMstlc Tickets Ba
Actrrefirated ?
A circular has been issued by the Demo
cratic State campaign committee warn
ing election officers that the committee
thinks it the duty of election officers to
tally the total votes cast for any candi
date, no matter under what heading or
designation a voter may stamp his ballot
lor such citididate. This is to cover the
d lficulty wuich may arite from the fact
that the same sets of Presidential electors
are printed on the Democratic and Popu
listic tickets. It remains to be seen
whether the election officers of the Staie
will heed the dictum of the Democratic
committee. It seems almost inevitable
i that a test of this matter will have to be
I niaue, and that it will be settled by a
j decision of the Supreme Court of the State,
I nnd possibly by the Supreme Court of the
United States.
O'Brien Scores Matjulre.
A rousing meetinc of the Thirty-second
Assembly District Republican Club was
held at Bo&rdman place last night. The
principal event of the evening was an ad
dress by Thomas B. O'Brien, who poured
hot shut into James G. Maguire for cer
tain utterances of a personal nature. His
speech was heartily applauded.
Death of Aclolph Ivronberg.
Adolph Kronber?, for many years a resident
of this City and well known In Hebrew circles,
died at his residence on Turt street early Mon
day morning, lie had been ill for some time,
but not seriously enough to be confined to his
home. He had always taken an active part in
politics and iv this campaign worked assidu
ously. The excitement of the canvass he wns
rnakin? brought en nervous prostration, from
which he did not recover. Mr. Kronbere was
a member of the Independent Order of B'nai
IJ'rlih and he was one oi the directors of the
B'nai B'rith Hall Association. He was a ua
tive of Austria, 50 years of ace, and leaves a
widow and several children. The funeral will
be held irom B'nai, B'rith Hall this morning.

FOB PRESIDENTâ

FOS TICK-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, *896Â»
Time flies and the Pops with it.
The weather cannot dampen enthusi
asm.
Come with the people and keep up the
shouting.
Honest money Democrats! come out of
the wilderness.
Every day brings Tom Reed nearer and
the victory also.
Have your decorations ready and don't
forget "Old Glory."
We expect all Central California to come
to town on Saturday.
The grand rally will be a ratification of
returning prosperity.
Look out for the campaign canard and
don't let it surprise you.
Next Tuesday we sweep Bryanism out
of the road and make way for business.
The man who advocates the coinage of
a dishonest dollar will appeal in vain for
the suffrages of an honest people.
The brightest sign of the times is to be
found on a law office in Canton and it
bears the name: William McKinley.
Illinois will not turn away from the
memories of Lincoln, Grant, Logan and
TrumbuU to vote for Bryan and Altgeld.
Bear in mind the importance of the
legislative ticket California cannot afford
to elect another free-trader to the Senate.
Four years ago the people voted for a
panic without knowing it, but they won't
vote for one this year with their eyes
open.
Nothing can stop the people this year â
they are determined to put an end to mis
chief-making agitations for a long time to
come.
The deficit in the treasury is crowing all
the time, and every day a new increase of
debt warns the people of the need of tariff
reform.
Workingmen know they had good wages
under the protective system in the past
and can count on them under the same
Bystem in the future.
Bryan is opposed to protection, opposed
to sound money, opposed to the civil serv
ice law, opposed to the Supreme Court and
decidedly opposed to common-sense.
The election of Bryan the blatherskite
would mean the domination of Altgeld
the anarchist and the Jaw-abiding people
of the country will never submit to that.
The hope of the Nation is the restora
tion of Republican rule, for all men can
see that the greater portion of our evils
has been brought upon us by Democratic
legislation.
The car on which Bryan is traveling
over the country is called the "Idler," and
it goes without saying that Bryan may
take the name for himself after the elec
tion is over.
The services of Colonel Taylor on the
Board of Supervisors are well known to
the people and give assurance of the zeal
and ability with which he will administer
the office of Mayor.
There is no question that the vote of
California will be given for McKinley.
When loyal Republicans and honest
money Democrats unite for the public
good nothing can resist them.
No man who wishes to preserve the pur
chasing rower of his wages, of his bank
Ravings, of his insurance, of his pension,
or of his income from rents will vote for
Bryan and the depreciated dollar.
To the glass-workers of Pennsylvania
who asked him to vote for protection to
their industries Bryan answered: "You
are robbers â you are public beggars," and
now he is going round begging working
men for their votes.
The big parade of Saturday will be a
?ight wortn seeing, and people from all
parts of the State should come to town and
lee how California can welcome Tom Reed
Ind ratify the union of good citizens of all
parties in the cause of good government.
One of the strange features of the cam
paign is that Senator Teller's speeches
aave been very coldly received all through
:he canvass, and he has not attracted half
is ranch attention as Altgeld or Tiliman.
He teems to be too conservative for the
Popocrats, and they do not warm up to
aim.
If under the free coinage of silver our
lollars should come to have the present
ralue of a half-doliar all specific duties on
'oreign imports would be lowered in value
;o that extent, thus decreasing the rev
t'.'.ue and at the same time breaking down
ihe protection now afforded to American
udustry.
TO SAN FRANCISCO REPUBLICANS
The Republicans of San Francisco who
love their party and hope to be proud of
its success in electing a President upon
Tuesday next have laid upon them a local
duty which complete loyalty to the party
requires them to perform. Conceding to
the local elector a certain degree of inde
pendence in the selection of strictly local
candidates there are certain offices in
volved in this election the regular nomi
nees for which should receive every Re
publican vote. These offices are the Presi
dential electors, the legislative candidates
and the nominee for Mayor of the City
of San Francisco.
It is hardly needful to argue that party
loyalty requires every Republican to vote
for those electors who are in turn to cast
their ballots for McKinley. These should
be voted for as a body, without any indi
vidual preference or objection, lest the
State of California should by any mis
chance be again committed to the humili
ation of a divided vote in the Electoral
College. It is not likely, however, that
the Republicans of California will this
year stray far from their duty of voting
for each and all of their party electors,
and this, with a large accretion of Demo
crats who hold the National honor and
safety in higher regard than their party
allegiance, will insure California a place
among the Republican States when the
electoral vote shall be cast.
It should be esteemed a no less Import
ant duty on the part of honest and loyal
Republicans to strive to elect a Mayor for
San Francisco who is also a Republican.
The chief magistrate of this great City is
something more than a mere petty muni
cipal official. He represents the most
populous and important subdivision of
the State. He performs duties and wields
an influence wider than the boundaries of
his civil jurisdiction. He illustrates the
strength and the purposes of bis party
within the metropolis of the State, anc
the City over whose affairs he presides is
reckoned to be Democratic, Republican or
Populist, according to tho politics of its
Mayor-elect.
The regular Republican nominee for
Mayor of sian Francisco is Colonel C. L.
Taylor. He represents in every sense the
honest purposes of hi 3 party for the wel
fare of the City. Against his integrity,
his intelligence and his official ability, as
measured by the test of experience, no
political critic has dared to raise his voice
in this campaign. If he shall be elected
San Francisco will be known as a Repub
lican City during hia administration, and
it goes without saying that during his
official term this City will have a Mayor
of whom the Republican party of Califor
nia may well afford to feel proud. These
things being true, it is the duty of every
Republican in San Francisco as a matter
of party loyalty and duty, to vote for
Colonel C. L. Taylor, the regular Republi
can nominee for Mayor.
There is still another set of officers for
whom every Republican wHbin his re
spective district should consider it his
duty to cast a vote. These are the regular
Republican nominees for the Legislature.
It is well understood that by the concur
rent action of the Senate and Assembly
of California at its next session a United
States Senator ia to be chosen. Next to a
Republican President it is the highest
duty which the people of the State owe to
their party to select Republican Senaiors.
When the President and the Senate are
Republican the administration is Repub
lican. It is therefore an imperative duty
laid upon every individual Republican to
assist to the extent of his power and in
fluence in the election of a Republican
Legislature. Let no loyal member of the
party fail upon next Tuesday to do his
full duty in this respect.
Tou can only prosper uponhonestprin
oipleg, honest purposes, honest laws,
public and private honor. Agriculture
will be prostrated, commerce will lan
guish, mining will decrease and manu
factures diminish, if to the misery of
partial free trade you add the heresy of
free silver, which, in this content, means
the violation of existing contracts ai;d
the utter disregard o f good faith and the
absolute repudiation, in whole or iv
part, of our public and private obliga
tions. â McXi lfy.
BANNER DAY.
Marcus A. Hanna, chairman of the Re
publican National Committee, has re
quested the State Central Committee to
make special efforts for the celebration of
flag day on Saturday, October 31. It is
the desire of the National Committee that
all Republicans should assemble in the
cities and town 9 nearest their homes and
shew their patriotism, devotion to coun
try and to their flag, and their intention
to support the party which stands for pro
tection, sound money and good govern
ment by having patriotic speeches and
such other exercises as will be appropriate
for the occasion, and tend to make the
day a general demonstration of the loyalty
of the people to National prosperity and
National integrity.
The address of the National Committee
is in harmony with the preparations al
ready made for the great patriotic demon
stration in this City on Saturday next.
That day will be for San Francisco and
indeed for all California a day of patriotic
loyalty and of public manifestation of de
votion to the nag and all that it symbol
izes for the American people. It will not
be a partisan demonstration in the sense
of parties, as they were aligned in former
years. Democrats and independents will
join with Republicans in celebrating the
day. It will mean the unity of the better
elements of the American people against
agitators and mischief-makers, and the
popular determination to maintain the
prosperity of American industry and the
soundness of American money.
From the time of the nomination of
Bryan it has been apparent to the Ameri
can people that all conservative citizens
would have to unite to check the tendency
toward civil disturbance, financial wreck
and industrial ruin. When the statesmen
of the Democratic party were hooted out
of the Chicago convention, and Altgeld,
Tiliman and Bryan took control, it was
made clear that tne long-postponed issue
between good government and lawlessness
had been forced upon us at last, and that
the people would have to face the elements
of discontent excited and augmented by
the hard times of the free-trade depres
sion, meet them in the discussion of the
campaign and overthrow them on elec
tion day.
It is altogether fitting, therefore, that
the closing day of the campaign should
be made a great rally of all those citizens
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1896.
wno believe in maintaining law and the
upholding of the existing order of society.
Everything which is represented by the
flag of the Nation is to-day represented by
McKinley and Kobart. Intelligent Demo
crats recognize this as clearly as do Re
publicans themselves. They have not
hesitated to declare themselves opposed
to Bryanism, even though that movement
masquerades under the old name of
D mocracy. They have come forth, as
their predecessors did in 1860, to stand for
the Union. Thousands of them will be
seen marching with Republicans on Sat
urday, and that great day will be in the
fullest sense of the word a banner d&y for
San Francisco.
Delegations from all interior counties
are expected in the City on that day.
Central California in particular will be
strongly represented. It will be made a
demonstration for the whole State. It will
have the inspiration of the presence of
Tom Reed. It will appeal to patriots by
all that the National banner stands for.
It will undoubtedly be tue most glorious
political demonstration ever made on the
Pacific Coast, and will carry to the East
the assurance that California stands with
her great sister States for the Nation ana
its stainless banner.
To coerce a voter i* a cr.ine against
the laws of the land, and if Messrs.
l!i van and Jonea knew ot coercion they
made themselves accomplices of th<*
criminals by not informing the proper
authorities and taking steps for prosecu
tion. It has been the policy of the Ke
publican party since its organization to
protect every cit zen in the exercise of
his elective franchise, and it will still
adhere to that policy.â Marcus A. Hanna.
THE OUTLOOK
The defeat of Bryan by an overwhelm
ing majority of the American people is as
well assured as any future event can be.
According to the latest estimates he is not
likely to carry more than twelve States in
the Union, and even these will be carried,
not on nis merits nor on the merits of his
platform, but solely because local ques
tions may determine the people of those
States to vote for him, being assured that
their votes will in no wise endanger their
prosperity by any chance of electing him.
We need not base our estimates of the
result of the election upon predictions
that are sent out from the Republican
headquarters. A sufficient basis for them
is found in the mighty forces which are
working against Uryanism and for the
success of McKinley and Hobart. No
man has ever been elected to the Presi
dency of the United States who has not
been supported by a large portion of the
character, intelligence and business ele
ment of the American people. Mr. Bryan
is opposed, not only by the united Repub
lican party, but by almost every sta esman
of rank and eminence in his own party.
Ouiside of the extreme Southern States, it
is difficult to lind any man of National
fame who advocates his election, and
throughout the entire Northern and West
ern States almost all the conservative
strength of the Democratic party is ac
tively and aggressively opposed to him.
The effect of the defection of leading
Democrats from the party is felt at the
party headquarters, and all reports show
that the National managers for the fusion
ticket nave virtually abandoned all hope
of success. Reporters wno visit botn
headquarters describe Chairman jones of
the fusion committee as listless, dreamy
and uncertain. There is no sign of vigor
or hopefulness anywhere around the com
mittee rooms. Everything is shiftless
and no one seems to have energy to do
anything beyond making a boast or utter
ing some claim of carrying disputed
States. In the Republican headquarters
all is different. Every man employed by
tne committee is full of vim and visor.
The energy of Mark Hanna is shown
everywhere, and from the highest to the
lowest among persons employed in the
headquarters there is an air of confidence
in coming success and of determination to
work for it with an unabating aggressive
ness.
With tnis contrast between the elements
behind Bryan ana the elements support
ing McKinley and Hobart, and the addi
tional contrast between the energy of the
Republican managers and the hesitating
timidity of the fusion managers, there
can be no possible doubt of what the re
sult is to be. It is not necessary that Mr.
Hanna should send out a prediction.
Every intelligent man can see for himself.
Let the people of San Franci-co look
around. .Let them talk with their neigh
bors, and if from this they cannot learn
that the election of McKinley is a cer
tainty they have only to wait and it will

The moment we go to free silver a
premium goes on gold, we logÂ« our
gold, the gold disappears from the cur
rency of the country. It is !5500,000,
-000 or 8600, 000,000 That gup must
be filled, because that will make an
immediate and severe contraction. The
mint capacity of the United Slates is
$40,000,000 a year, going eight hnuvs
a <lny and running the mints at the full
capacity on s'andard silver dollars. At
that rate it would t-ike them more than
ten years to fill thn gap caused by the
disappearance of gold.â Senator Lodge.
THE BRONZE BAOCHANTE
While the country at large has been con
cerned almost wholly with the Presiden
tial campaign the pood people of the city
of Boston have been engaged in a contest
of their own which, while it may be called
a tempest in c teapot, has nevertheless
been hot enough to make the water boil.
The cause of the heat was the presenta
tion to the Public Library of a bronze
Bacchante by Mr. MacMonnies which was
altogether too shocking for the good peo
ple of Boston to gaze upon with serenity
of mind.
William Jennings Bryan ia the bronze
Bacchante of American politics. His
figure in this campaign has disturbed the
orderly good sense of the people generally
as much as the bronze extravagance of
Mr. MacMonnies disturbed the peoDle of
Boston. His canvass has been as alien to
American sensibilities as was the statue of
the immoral artist. His speeches and
harangues have sounded more like mad
appeals to European mobs than to well or
dered American citizens. He has gone
about the country exaggerating every dis
content, inciting every envy and arousing
every p/assion which could be affected by
the language of a demagocue and has
shown himself better fitted to be the leader
of a Parisian Commune than of an Ameri
can party.
Even those who were not driven out of
the Democratic party by the Chicago plat
form have looked with amazement upon
the extraordinary course of the Chicago
candidate for the Presidency. When he
announced early in the canvass that h
was going to New York to begin his cam
paign in the "enemies' country," they re
garded this as simply an extravagance of
speech. They could hardly believe that a
man who sought to be President of the
United States would speak of any portion
of his common country aa a land of the en
emy. Mr. Bryan, however, soon showed
them that he intended to make a sectional
canvass and that he did in all seriousness
regard the East as the enemy of the West.
Later on he went further still. Demo
crats who hoped to be able to support the
ticket while scorning the platform were
shown that Mr. Bryan intended not merely
a sectional canvass but a class canvass.
He not only regarded New York as the
enemy of Nebraska, but he spoke of capi
tal as the enemy of labor and property as
the foe of poverty. Never did a Bac
chante iv the days of old run greater riot
through the woods of Greece than ha 3
Bryan run through this campaign. Talk
ing of the strife of classes and the strife of
sections with a lightness which seems to
imply a total lack of moral responsibility
as well as of political sense, he has made
himself the most amazing figure known
to our politics.
The American people can accept him as
typical of our statecraft no more than Bos
ton can accept the last extravagance of
Mr. MacMonnies as typical of what they
meant when they erected their creat pub
lic library. As Boston rejected the Pari
sian madness of her gifted artist, so will
the American people reject the Chicago
madness of Democracy. There is a limit
beyond which extravaganc of any kind
cannot be carried in this country, and
the bronze Bacchante of politics, as well
as that ot art, has gone beyond the line
and will not be tolerated by the people.

One Dallas Man Must Weae the Othee's
Garments.
Boston Journal.
There are two men in Dallas, Tex , who are
as different in their build as they are in their
politics. One is a McKinley gold man, and the
other is a Bryan silverite. One is short and
fat, not more than 5 feet 4 inches in heipht,
ivlthouiÂ»h He weighs rather more than 2fÂ»o
pounds. The other is as slim as a rail, and
could make money us a living skeleton in a
dime museum, as he is 0 feet 2 inches in
height.
The two men are great friends, however, and
one day, while engaged in the luxury of a
joint debate on the issues of the dÂ«y, the fat
man proposed with the thin man that they
make a wager. The terms proposed were that
if McKinley won the fat man was io wear a
suit of the thin man's clothes for a month,
while, on tne other hand, if Bryan were to
come out at the lop of the poll, t.ie thin man
would wear the other's clothes for the same
length of time.
The friends are very much interested in the
outcome of the novel wager, although it is
suggested that the thin man hns rather the
belter of thu wager, for he will be covered,
except at least as much as the average bicycler
exposes, while the tat man could not get into
the thin man's raiment without bursting it.

THE SITUATION IN OLD VIRGINIA
We are permitted to make the following ex
tract from a private letter written by Joseph
Bryan, proprietor of the Richmond Times,
dated October 20, 1896. Mr. Bryan is one of
the lending men of Virginia and was formerly
an officer in Mosby's battalion. The letter is
as follows:
"My Dear Colonel: * * * The situation- Is
immensely improved in Virginia ar:d we have
Rood hope that the State will actually go for
McKinley. I believe that it would certainly
do so if we could get a fair election, but the
scoundrels are kicking and squealing; and
being in full pos-ession of the machinery and
utterly unscrupulous wo will have a hard
time." * * *
The colonel has also received a letter from
Colonel James I). Brady, secretary for Virginia
of the National Campnien Committee, dated
Richmond, October 19, 1896, in which hesays:
â 'Thousands ot heretofore Democrats have
announced their purpose to vote for McKtnley
and we will undoubtedly carry the State unless
the most infamous -ystem of ballot-box stuff
ing ever Heard of is put into operation on elec
tion day. The Silvcrites, or "Coxeyites" as
you properly call them, are desperate. We
have driven them to the wall and tney are
mad enough to take their shotguns and kill
the Sound-Money Democrats. Everything is
redhot in Virginia." â¢ .*â¢ â¢

McKINLEY OR BRYAN.
The Contrast Between the Jiival Candl~
' dates for â  Ihe ''Presidency.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Dear
Sir: It seems to a non-newspaper man, which
the writer is, that since the Bryanite organs
have wholly abandoned legitimate argument,
and now confine themselves almost exclusively
to vilification of Mr. Hanna and abuse of
Major McKinley as "Hanna's Mau McKinley,"
it may not be improper nor unprofitable to
compare the nominations of the two candi
dates and thus ascertain which would be the
more likely to be influenced in case of an
election.
It is well known to all intelligent voters that
during the past four years no name has been
more prominent than that of Major McKinley
as the probable candidate of the Republican
National Convention of 1896. His intimate
connection with the McKiDlev tariff law, the
successtul operation of that law, the emphatic
repudiation of the repeal of that law in the
elections of two years ago, and the triumphant
election of Mr. McKinley as Governor of his
own State by au overwhelming majority, all
combined to designate him as the logical
leader of the Republican party in the present
contest for the Presidency. He was not and is
not the choice of any one man or of any clique,
but the chosen candidate oi the great Dody of
the Republican party through their repre
sentatives. Even tne leading Bryan organ of
this City predicted his nomination long before
the a?sembling of the St. Louis convention,
and previous to the mention oi Mr. Hanna's
name iv connection with the nomination or
subsequent campaign.
The truth is Mr. MeKiuley is no man's man,
ami the Bryan oruans are well cognizant of
tins fact. He has ever been independent in
his views and fearless in their advocacy. If
elected.it will be by the votes of intelligent
and patriotic citizens, and to them only will
he be accountable, aud by their best interests
only wit! he be influenced.
But how different is the case of Mr. Bryan.
Prior to the Chicago convention no mention
appears ever to have been made of his
name as coming b fore any political con
vention for Presidential honors. And uo one,
in the wildest flights of lancy, co Id have
imuginea him as the nominee of the Demo
cratic National Convention. But when the
Chicago convention assembled and the wily
Altgeld of anarch. stic notoriety . b.ained coa
trol of that convention and formulated its :ev
olutiomry platform, tnus causing all true con
servative Democrats to withdraw, then Mr.
Bryan became not only the probuble but the
lofeical candidate of such a couvemiou to stand
o;i such a jiiatlorm.
The motiey a sembly of delegates, represent
ing every shade of politic*) erankism, unused
to the c ocution ot the schools and the high
sounding phrases ot sophomoric rot, listened
to the boy orator and were captured.
They became hysterical, and in a fit of hys
terics declared that tho youth.ul Mr. Bryan
! should be their leader in the Presidential
fi^ht. And so he is, the hysteric product of
sophomoric rot. It must be remembered, how
ever, that the nomination of the boy orator
only became possiDle throueh tne prior ma
nipulations oi the crafty Altgeld. Vhatever
Mr. Bryan now is as a Presidential candilate,
ami \\ haicV'-r his ci.ances may be, he is wholly
indebted thert-for to Altgeld, the anÂ«rchist
Eardosier and friend of anarchy. And in the
ands of this crafty schemer the susceptible
and visionary young orator can be but as
dough in the hands of the baker. He is Alt
gi-iu'.- man or tool, so to speak, a^d Altgeld is
I not the man to take his hanas off any tool so
1 long as he can wield it for the accomplish
i incut of his own selfish purposes.
Such, briefly stmed, ar the facts bearing
upon the nomination of each of the lerding
candidates for he Presidency, and, iv view of
these facts who can have any doubt as to
which of the candidates vyouid be the more
su-ccptible to individual innueuce iv case of
election. There can be but one answer. Mr.
Bryan, thou art the man.

SILVER JACOBINS.
A. Lesion From the History of franco
of Present "Application.
Editor Call: For years prior to the French
revolution the nobility and aristocracy of
France thought it fashionable to advocate tho
extreme radical theories of certain French
political economists and writers who were ad
vocating a radical change in the political and
social system of France, not because they be
lieved in the uew school, but because they (the
nobility) wanted to show their contempt for
their King, as they believed that the old
feudal power which the French nobility ex
erted over their sovereign was slipping from
their grasp; so to counteract the growing
power of the sovereign the nobility coni
meuced to advocate the advance theories of
the new radical school of the eighteenth cen
tury. And what was the resu.t? Anarchy,
revolution aud death. In a year of financial
depression, misery and want the States Gen
eral, composed of the different estates (clashes),
was callod to grant relief. Yet no effective
measures were passed granting reiiff, on ac
count of ihe attitude of the leaders of the es
tatesâtho nobility because they thought it
was good policy to follow radical views and
hamper tne King whenever he offered any
measure for the relief of the people.
Now, in the Presidential campaign of 1896,
we are witnessing the same species of po.iticul
demagogism made by the silver barons of
America, believing that the power by which
they have controlled silver legislation in
America i-ince 1873 was slipping from their
grasD, have entered Into an alliance with the
Democratic-Populist party, and the party lead
ers of this hybrid combination are now advo
cating revolutionary measures if success does
crown the ticket of Bryan and the Siamese
twin possibilities, Sewall or Watson.
The leaders of the present anarchistic, social
istic Democratic-Popuist party knowing that
there was no chance for the success of the
Democratic parly if the Democracy fought its
battles in the Presidential campaign of Y 96 on
the real issues of the day, the question of pro
tection versus free trade, whicn went against
them in the Congressional fight of '94, result
ing in the election of a R -publican House of
Representatives; a rfew issue must be brought
forth to gull the American people, so the crime
of ' 73 was brought forward, the great "silver
conspiracy" that has taken the silverites
twenty-three years to find out, aud to secure
its passage through Congress Senator Stewart
of Nevada voted in the affirmative, for which
part Senator Stewart now turns state's evi
dence and asks the people of the Pacific Slope
that he be forgiven for his past sins ana trans
gressions. And the leaders of this so-called
Democratic Convention, held in Chicago in
July last thought by picturing to the masses
the degradation and want caused by financial
depression made by the repeal of the McKinley
bill have now sought to continue ia control of
this Government by trying to array class
against class, if classes exist in America, claim
lug that the present condition of affairs is
caused by class legislation arraying the rich
against the poor and against capital
accusing the money power of the United States
of trying to restrict or contract the output of
money to the detriment of the people by hos-
Ule financial legislation. While talking revo
lution do they remember tne aftermath oi

on the fact that the same story had been pub
lished in many of the Eastern papers, each one
declaring that it had occurred in the city of
publication, and in each Instan c it was cred
ited to a different sineer. Since then this de
partment has received a communication from
a friend, in which is made the assertion that
the song was sung by Miss Abbott to Philip J.
Boost when he was dying, and that his
broi her, J. Boost, now living in this City, on
Twenty-filth street, still has the leaves of the
rose torn apart by the prima donna when she
sang the sweet words of Tom Moore. Another
friend has submitted a copy of a letter written
by Boost in San Francisco, December 19, 1890.
It was addressed to his father and mother,
who were living in tne East, and in it he
wrote :
Do you remember, mother, when yon were ont
here and I went to the Bush-streei Theater to sea
Herman? Km ma Abbott occupied one of the
boxes that evening. She Is now playing at the
BaMwin TheÃti-r with her opera company. I
have an old friend. Mrs. HoMlinu, who lives at the
Baldwin Hotel, where Miss Abbo.t Is stay In?. -ShÂ«
called to set- me a few days bacK, ano as we were
talking about the opera I said I w ould so much
iiÂ«e to b<ar Miss .^bbott sing the "Last Kose of
Summer." Now, she said noihiii? to Miss Abbott,
but in a round about, way Miss Abboit i,'.eard of
my remark and said that it I cou.d noi come to
the opera-house 1 shuuld hear the song anyway,
for she cou d come up to mv room and sine it tor
me; and, tur.- enough, yeste rda> afternoon she
came up and spent half an hour wHh me. she
broj ht some roses and viole s and sang "The
Last Hose ot .-ummer." It must be heard as sung
by her to be comprehended. Its beau.y and
melody I cannot describe. Iv singing the song
she pulled a .ose apart, leaf by le t. and then let
them drop to the floor. I send you in this lVtter
sora.- of the leaves anil some of the violets she
gave me. she is a kind, womanly wmian, and
treated me lixe an old irieud and cried because abe
could do n thing for me.
Young Boost died in this City a short time
after Miss Abbott sang the song to him.
THE REAL GOOD STANDARD.
Ex-Secretary Bout well.
A gold standard does not imDly the exclu
sive use of gold, as Bryan and hia followers
teach. Our standard is gold, and tne circula
tion in millions is thus divided: Gold, $4(J3,
--000,000; silver, $497,000,000; paper, $577,
--000,000.
The duty of a country under a gold standard
is periormed fully when gold can be hail for
international transactions and for domestic
purposes without the payment of a premium.
This is the condition of the United States to
day.
HONEST MEN STAND TOGETHER.
New York Advertiser.
For the last days of the campaign we want
honest men everywhere to stand together. We
want them to vote for goo^l money. We want
them to vote against silver swindles and repu
diation. A vote for McKinley is a vote for
good business and good wastes. It is a vote
against idleness and starvation. It is a vjote
for the enforcement of the law, to uphold our
courts and the President of the United States
In the preservation of peace. It is a vote for
the glorious old nag, that should never te at
tacked bj our own countrymen!
SPEAKS WITHOUT AN INSCRIP
TION
Chicago Tribune.
If each American flag that is displayed in
Ctiicago every day represents a Republican
vote it is hardiy an exaggeration to say Mc-
Kinley will carry Chicago. There is scarcely a
downtown business block without a flag at
every one of its windows, and scarcely a resi
dence that does not put out its flag every
morning.
Every street intersection in the downtown
district has two to four of the symbols of lib*
eriy floating overhead, and scarcely a vessel
passes up or down the Chicago River tnat does
not carry the American flag displayed, as if in
defiance to some hidden enemy.
A noticeable feature of the display is that
very few of the flags carry any sort of political
emblem. Tne stars aud stripes tell their own
story better than uuy campaign orator could
doit. They do not need the emblem of a gold
dollar sewed to them to tell the crowds in the
streets that the men who have hung them
there are opposed to National dishonesty.

General Chipman and J. C. Camppell
spoke last night at the Auditorium before
the guests of the McKinley Invincibles.
Under the names of successive Presiden-
GENERAL N. P. CHIPMAN, the Veteran Orator, Who Addressed the Mass-Meeting at the Auditorium.
tial candidates the Invincibles have held
ud the Republican banner in this Slate
since the Grant and Coifax campaign of
1868.
It was in those days, when Major Jack
Stratrnan was presi lent of the club which
met in old Congress Hall, on Bush street,
near Belden place, that it was unsafe to
openly avow being a Republican, so bitter
was ihe opposing political element. ThÂ»
meetings of the Grant Invincibles, there
fore, were secre:, a password being re
quired to gain an admission to them.
It was not so last night at tbe Audi
torium meeting. The doors were thrown
wide open and men and women were
given ample cnanco to listen to the
speakers and learn the true doctrine upon
which the Republicans of this advanced
day baso their platform.
In 1876 it was the Hayes invincibles;
tben, in 1880, the Garfield Invincibles
were to the front. They were called the
Blame invincibles after that until in 1888,
they were the Harrison Invincibles uniil
1892.
From this aggregation of sound Repub
licans the present McKinley Invincioles
spring as legitimate successors.
They have stepped forwari so far as to
be able to br.ng to their rueetines their
sweethearts, wives and children to listen to
able orators, just as they would to a rendi
tion of a highly educational effort by a
recognized master.
Music was provided to entertain the
auciie cc between the speeches. There
was an excellent band and a talented^
quartet, and Mrs. Nellie Molbrook Blinn
recited "Old Glory."
The speakers of the evening â General
Cbipman and J. C. Campbell â touched
upon the various issues of the day. The
former andkd facts only, making no
endeavor toward oratory or embellish
ment of phrase.
He presented unvarnished and stern
realities. Campbell, while following the
same strain, punctuated his remarks with
pleasant ana appropriate anecdotss.
Promptly at 7:30, Chairman A. G. Booth
called the great assemblage of people to
order, and in a few stirring words went
into the object of the meeting.
It was an elucidation of the money ques
tion of the present campaign and the
principal issue before the people to-day.
At the close of his remarks he introduced
the first speaker of tbe evening, General
N. P. Chipman, the venerable orator
whose voice has so often been heard in
ringing terms advocating ;h e principles of
Rei-Ã¼b.icanism and patriotism.
When the general arose from his place
among the gentlemen and ladies that
crowded the stage of the Auditorium, the
applause that burst out from all parts o;
the house was spontaneous, deafenin and
continuous. Quiet at last bettled down
over the audience and the speaker without
preliminaries launched into his subject.
"Tbe Democratic party,'" said be, "has
declared in ;avor of silver a: the ratio of
16 to 1. This declaration carries with it
the index of absurdity when it is krown
that the commercial ratio is about 30 to 1,
and they have resolved that the people
shall receive this debased currency.
"Now stop and consider what an en
croachment this is upon your risrhts, that
you shall accept in your private contracts
a coin oi fa se measure, a money of depre
ciated value.
"Now there is one other matter I want
to speak of, and that is the misapprehen
sion as to what these new dollars are to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1896.
be. They fthe Democrats and Populists]
s-ay tbese pieces of silver shall have just
the same purchasing power as the sound
dollars of a past coinage.
"The dollar of to-day stands the un
changeable and everlasting pledge of the
United States Government. Tlie gre*t
republic issues it and redeems it at the
same value and makes it of the same
value all over the globe. And what is this
Bryan dollar to be? It i 3 to have the same
inscription, the same device, the same 'In-
God-We-Trust' motto united thereon, but
what else? Nothing.
"The Government does not issue it and
does not stamp a changeless value on its
face. There is no reception by the Gov
ernment and no redemption. The mint
only take the rough bullion from the
miner and hands him back the coins it
shapes from that metal, just as the miller
gives back to the farmer the flour he
grinds from the wheat brought to his door.
[ADplause.]
"I have in my hand two Mexican dol
lars, which have each 3 cents more silver
than the dollars minted in the United
States. Now, I ask why is it that tnese
two coins, having intrinsically more value,
can be bought for one of our dollars?
Mexico is coining freely 40,000,000 of these
silver dollars every year, bur. she cannot
bring tliem up to a parity with gold.
"Nothing can bring about this equality
of values unless a great government, like
that of the United States, stands back of
the co'nage. [Applause and cheer*.]
"Why did the Democratic party declare
in favor of the ratio of 16 to 1 when they
could have advocated any ratio with as
much reason? Now it took the fathers of
the country years to learn just the exact
relative value of the money of this land
and to fix its intrinsic and commercial
standing.
'In 1792 it was placed at 1 to 15, but be
ing at 15J^ to 1 in France international
confusion resulted. In 1837 the ratio was
fix<"(i at 1 to 10, but this not being enough
2-100 of a grain of gold was added in order
to eqnaliae the two ratios. The Republi
can party is and always has been the
Inend of silver. From *1793 to 1853 we
coined over $7ii.000,000 of that me;al and
from 1853 to 1873 upward ol $65,000,000.
From that 'late to the present time we
minte i $552 650,744.
"All down the line of the Democratic
i arty you can read their inconsistent and
wild statements regarding the financial
condition of the country.
'â¢They have said that among other de
plorable things the demonetization of sil
ver would iower the price at wheat. Well,
you have seen by the market quotations
of the last few days how that argument
has been answered.
"Yet a few more days and every argu
ment of the Bryan orators will have been
answered in tbe same manner. They also
p,ay onr per capita circulation has run
down; but I need not tell you liow false
that statement is ami how wealthy we are
compared with other nations.
"Of the act of 1873, 'the crime' they now
call it, I for an answer point to tbe
glorious record of the Republican party
[applause], the years of prosperity, the
decrease of the National rtebt, the finances
of tbe Republic on a sound foundation
j and the cood coin of the realm honored
I amonj the nations of the earth.
" 'He who runs may read,' and all will
read and be convinced ere November 3,
and the truth that is in the Republican
party will prevail.
"The avowed purpose of the Democratic
party is to array the South against the
North, section against section and class
against class. The Republican party has
never elected a President on these lines.
Such a man is false to his country and
would tear down the temple of liberty.
"I do not believe that the millions of
voters of the iorty-five Ssates of this
Union will elect to fasten upon the coup
try the oligarchy of free trad* and free
siiver, and that is all that can be hoped for
in the choice of Bryan. It is contrray to
American principle and American pa?
triotism. [Applause.] The Republic will
live and its glorious institutions will con
tinue to prosper, with protection its watch
word " [Great applause and cheers from,
all parts ii the house.]
Chairman Booth introduced J. C. Camp
bell immediately after the rendition of
"Old Glory" by Mrs. Nellie Holbrook
Blinn.
The speaker's remarks might be summed
up into these facts: Bilver is not the
main question at issue now, but pro
tection, which will open up the
factories and mills of the United
States in preference to the mints;
protection against immigration which has
brought 15,000,000 people into this coun
try in fifteen years, to a good purpose, but
which is sufficient for the time being, but
which threatens the livelihood of the boys
and girls already here; the prosperity of
the country for twenty years under a Re
publican form of government, and the ter r
rible depression which has existed during
the past five year?.
"The time has passed,'' said the speaker
in prefacing his remarks, "to give figures;
we must at this time consider what are
the facts that we know exist. We know
our mills are closed and we want to bear
the wheels of our machinery keeping time
to the song of the wind."
Touching upon the financial ques
tion Mr. Campbell stated: "Four
years a o tbe surplus was the oane of the
Democrat's life. Where is that surplus
now? We have goue $260,000,000 in debt
since they were howling that we have too
much money in our treasury."
As both General Caipman and J, C.
Campell have visited every county in the
State the latter speaker ventured to say:
"From what I have seen California will
give McKiniey a majority ol 15,000, and it
remains witn us in San Francisco to make
it more.
"We want to send a solid Republican
delegation to Congress and a Republican
delegation to the Legislature wno will
elect a Republican Senator to Washing
ton."
OBSTRUCTED A CAR.
F. t>. Wilson Arrested for Slow Driving
Contrary to Law,
F. L. Wilson's stubbornness or peculiar
idea of a joke, U is not known which, re
sulted in his getting arrested last evening
ou a charge of obstructing a streetcar.
The young man, who is a salesman by oc
cupation, was out delivering some goods,
using a horse and wagon for the purpose.
He turned into Kearny street at Wash
ington, and, finding himself in front of a
Bouthbound electric car, evidently con
cluded to enjoy himself. The motorman
rang for him to turn from the track, but
he failed to do so. The horse jogged along,
dragging the wagon directly on the car
tracks, and tho motorman ran? his bell
in vain.
This state of affairs continued until Post
street was reached. At this point the
conductor pot off and notified Policeman
F. W. Engel regarding the young man's
actions and Wilson was placed under ar
rest. He denied remaining on the tracks
for tbe purpose of obstructing the car, but
nevertheless he was obliged U> produce $10
bail before he was released.
AMERICAN SECURITIES,
What Would Happen in Europe
if W. J. Bryan Were
Elected.
Eiitor Thomas Lloyd of the London
"Statist" on the Present
Campaign.
Thomas Lloyd, editor of the London
Statist, the greatest journal of finance in
England and probably of the world, ar
rived here yesterday and is at the Palace.
Mr. Lioyd is accompanied by Mrs. Lloyd
and Miss May Lloyd.
The distinguished editor came over to
America several weeks ago to study the
campaign, with the object of getting tne
sentiment of the people on tbe money
question. He stayed for a time in New
York and other Eastern cities, and then
went to Chicago. After he had been there
long enough to view the situation he went
to St. Paul and Minneapolis.
He came on to the Pacific Coast from
there, and has recently been in Portland.
Mr. Lloyd's paper is regarded as an
authority among European investors. It
has a very large circulation. Mr. Lloyd
has devoted many years to the study of
financial questions.
He said last night, when a Call repre
sentative called on him, that he did not
desire to be understood as interfering in
politics here. He haa met a great many
Americans, and had altogether been
treuted so cordially that he hesitated
while among us to speak all that he be
lieved woula happen in case Mr. Bryan
was elected. Besides this he bad no wish
to gain the ill will of any of the people
here.
"I found in Chicago, as in the cities
farther East," said Mr. Lloyd, "that the
great majority of the people with whom I
talked who had any property were for
McKinley. This extended even to tbe
barbers whom I met. Th^y thought the
country sufer with Mr. McKinley at its
head than with Mr. Bryan and Iree silver.
The pcnpral belief was that there was too
much risk in electing Mr. Bryan.
"The Republicans, too, were very en
thusiastic, and I find they claimed much
greater majorities than the Bryan people.
The Bry^an men did not ciairu large ma
jorities. Of course I was simply a looksr
on and do not pretend to say how things
actually were, for I did not meet as many
of the faboring men and farmers as I did
of the others. However, so far as I coulu
judge, the great majority were unques
tionably in favor of M^Kinley.
â¢â¢In St. Paul and Minneapolis I found
the condition sometuing the same, except
that when I mentioned to some Bryan
men the great number of McKinley but
tons displayed they claimed they did not
mean anything â that they would in a
large measure vote for Bryan on election
day. One man would tell me one thing
and another another thing, so that I could
not fully make up my mind. But, as I
viewed it, there were more McKinley
men than men for Bryan.
"It seemed to me that the McKinley
men were also in the majority in Oregon,
and at any rate, wherever I was, I found
that the men who were possessed of prop
erty wore for McKiuley.
"Now, as to what will result here in my
judgment in case Bryan is electedâ that is.
as to whether there will be a panic â 1
hesitate to speak, for 1 fear the followers
of Mr. Bryan might claim I was interfer
ing with something that was none of my
business. Ido not wish jo do that. lam
simply looking on and gaining what infor
mation I can duiing tbe campaign.
"However, if you ask me what will be
the effect of Mr. Bryan's election, so far as
American securities in Europe is con
cerned, I can say in my judgment it will
be bad. They will begin at once to unload
these securities, and so many of them be
ing unloaded at once it cannot be other
wise than that they will depress the mar
ket and produce abroad what would seem
now to be little less than a panic.
"Such a result occurring abroad, I think
it will be seen that it must affect things
here, and bow much the people here must
judge.
"To the countries of Europe the situa
tion in the United States would seem very
serious. The people there cannot under
stand why any of the people here who
believe in the honest payment of obliga
tions should want tree silver. Ot course,
the people of Europe who have lent
money or become investors even to the
extent of $100 say for example, want to
get $100 back.
"Whatever sums they have lent or in
vested, they do not want to lose anything.
This is the whole situation, and if the
people of this country woula reflect I
believe they would sea that this is only
justice."

COL, TAYLOR ON
NATIONAL POLITICS
He Says That McKinley's
Election Is the Desir
able Thing.
His Defeat Means a Continuance
of Disasters and Hard
Times.
" WHAT ABOUT YOURSELF ?"
In Answer to a Voice in the Audience
He Tell What He Will Do
When Elected Mayor.
Colonel C.L.Taylor appeared at the rally
of the Spanish- American League at Califor
nia Hall on Bush street last evening and
was greeted with spontaneous enthusiasm
by the big audience.
Colonel Taylor is conducting a cam
paign that enlists the respect and confi
dence of every good citizen.
He is anxious for the success of the local
Republican ticket, at the head of which
stands his own name; but, as he said in
an address last night, "I 3"metimes forget
that I am a candidate, so engrossed am I
in the triuniph of the National Republican
ticket."
And so he appears to be. In his whole
address last evening he scarcely referred
to his own candidacy.
He talked of the thing of chief moment
to all good citizens â the National election.
Without posing as such he appeared to
the audience as a man, a patriot, who
could sacrifice his own personal career, if
need be, to secure the election of the head
of tbe National ticket.
"I tell you, my fellow-citizens," he said,
"this gathering means something. It is
significant of the feeling that tne new
element of citizenship in this Nation has
in its destiny a desire for its stability, a
desire lor good government. I have been
doing yeoman work throughout this City
and County for the National Re
publican ticket. We could live through
a couple of years if some worse man
than myself were elected Mayor. But I
hesitate to paint the picture of what
might follow upon the election of irre
sponsible experimenters licensed to juggle
with the finances of the Nation. At its
very mildest it would mean an indefinite
extension of this period of prostration of
business aud enterprise, an increasing
number of people out of employment, suf
fering, distress and contraction of values.
I started in life as a working man.
I worked for what I hav<\ I
thought I had, by my industry,
accumulated a fair share, but I have seen
the values shrink .to a comparative noth
ing. So every man who owns property
has suffered. But the laborer who has
only what he earns from day to day â
what becomes of him when he loses the
means of earning his living? He is the
greatest sufferer of ail, and my sympa
thies are with him.
"So we want to bring this distressing
period of doubt and uncertainty and loss
and distress to an end. We want a return
of confidence in the Government, and that
means an expansion of trade and of values
and employment of labor all at once."
Some one in the audience as'ied, "But
what about yourself and the mayoralty?"
â¢'Well," said Colonel Taylor, "for my
self 1 have to say that if you desire to see
the executive office of this City and County
conducted upon a basis of justice to all,
without regard to creed or color or condi
tion, you may with entire confidence give
me your suffrage. If elected Mayor I will
do all that in my power lies to advance
the interests of the City upon sale lines.
"I have to say that the franchises which
have been given so lightly and without
any consideration to corporation sought to
be paying large sums into the City
treasury, thereby reducing the taxes of
the people. I believe with such an ex
ampe as Glasgow before us, where
these public conveniences pay the
entire expenses of the government,
we should at least move in that direction.
I assure you that :f I had a veto no fran
chise should be allowed to anybody that
did not make provision for paying a good
percentage of its earnings to the City.
[Applause.] In my capacity .as Super
visor I was instrumental in fixing such a
toll upon a new telephone company that
one of its managers saicj it would be worth
millions to the City. What we want, my
friends, is government. L'-'t us
elect the full Republican tirket from Mc-
Kinley down." [Great applause.]
A number of other candidates addressed
the meeting, as well as Mrs. Spenc?r in
behalf of woman suffrage. The lady sang
the "Star-spangled Banner," the audience
joining.
The league decided to take part in num
bers in the big parade of Saturday.
ERRONEOUS INFORMATION
"Why I*. A G. Brenner Were Included

Recently there appeared in The Call
the story of a suit in which L. &. G. Bren

have been construed to a reflection on the

attorney in that suit to L. & G. Brenner,
dated October 22, 1896, is self-explanatory :
Messrs. L. &O. Brennerâ Dear Sirs: After a

you that while my duty toward my clients
forced me to take this step, It was based upon
information entirely erroneous. * * â¢ Im
diately upon the return of Mr. Gus Brenner to
this City he called upon me and to my satis
faction explained his entire connection with
the money sued for, which was purely acci
dental and innocent and without any im
proper motive on his part.
I there lore take great pleasure in asserting
that I entirely rely upon Mr. Brenuer's plain
and straightforward statement of facts, and
to further advise you that had I been in pos

of the suit alluded to your firm would never
have been made defendant.
I write this letter as a matter of justice to
you, and with assurance of my personal es
teem, I am, very truly yours, Henry Ach.
Mr. Ach indicated the situation by re
questing Judge Daingerfield to dismiss
the action against Messrs. L. & G. Bren
ner, stating in open court that it was
brought under misapprehension, which
he sincerely regretted. The court dis
missed the suit at once.
WATCH THE COUNT.
The Charter Association Explains to
Itev. Father Yorke the Object of
Certain Circulars.
The following open letter to Key. Peter
C. Yorke explains itself:
Eev. Peter C. Yorke, Cityâ Dear Sir : In the
report of your address last evening, as pub
lished to-day, reference Is made to a letter,
purported to have been sent by the Merchants'
Association, lor persons to watch the count at
the approaching election. Permit us to cor
rect the impression conveyed by your words
that letters of any description have been sent
by the Merchants' Association to any organi
zation on this subject.
As a matter of fact, the Citizens' Charter
Association issued 1787 copies of a circular
letter and postal card, of which copies are
herewith Inclosed. They we:e sent to all pub
lic organizations in San Francisco mention -d
in the City Directory. Tbis list comprises 5G7
organizations of every description, and is
open to the inspection of yourself or any per
son interested. Athletic, benevolent, com
mercial, fraternal, labor, literary, social,
scientific, State and trade organizations are
included. There is absolutely neither distinc
tion nor discrimination as to nationality or
religious belief.
In organizing this force of watchers at the
election precincts, not the slightest reflection
is made upon the many worthy citizens, who
have been appointea election officers. The
force of watchers organized by the Charter As
sociation joined by the Democratic State Cen
tral Comiuiuee and the Non-Partisan Darty.
will co-operate with all honest election officials
to secure a correct and prompt count of the
entire electoral ticket. The official record of
past elections in this City proves conclusively
that grave frauds have benn perpetrated at
tne ballot-box. Surely, there can be no more
patriotic duty than to guard the uanctity of
the ba.lot and stamp out this threatening dan
ger to the sovereign right oi the people. Re
spectfully yours,
citizens' Charter Association.

The old case of Thomas K. Stately against

inence again yesterday when Judge Morrow
cited John Chat wood, E. G. Knapp and Thomp

called that Jndge Morrow granted an injunc
tion in favor of Stately, restraining the parties
named above from proceeding in the State
courts. Recently it appears Thompson &
Thompson made application to Department 3
of the Superior Court to pay Chatwood certain
fees alleged to be due, hence the contempt
proceedings of yesterday. The gentlemen
named have made affidavit that they were not
aware of an injunction having been issued,
ana it is thought that on this showing tbe con
tempt proceedings, which are down Tor hear
ing November 10, will be dismissed.

READY FOR THE BUGLE CALL AT INGLESIDE
Grand Opening of the Racing
Season in San Fran
cisco.
The "Opening Day" Handicap the
Feature of the Day's
Spore.
TAME KACING IN OAKLAND.
Two Out of Five Favorites Win.
Tommy Butler Rode a Great Fin
ish on Peter the Sicond.
After three days of sport at tne California
Jockey Club's new Oakland track, that
meeting was brought to a ciose yesterday,
and to-day Inpleside track, the home of
the progressive Pacific Coast JocEey Club,
will celebrate the opening of the fall and
winter racing season on this side of the
nay. With its elegant new club
house, just completed, and the grounds
beautiSed by landscape gardening, shade
trees and palms, the course will appear
lite an apparition to those racegoers who
have not visited the track since the close
of last meeting. The clubhouse is one of
the handsomest structures to be seen on
any racecourse in America, and during
the season will be graced by the presence
of some of San Francisco's most select so
ciety ; a valuable adjunct to the sport.
A. B. Spreckels, president of the club,
and Secretary W. S. Leake have been ex
ceedingly busy the past few days attend
ing to the many minor details, and to-day
all is in readiness tor the opening.
Noted for the clean quality of sport fur
nished the race-goiug public at its initial
meeting, the officials of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club intend that during tne com
ing eeason this same high standard of ex
cellence shall be maintained, and jobbery
will not be tolerated. As an incentive for
honest racing the club hangs up rich
purses for each event, and the owner,
trainer or jocktjy caught dealing in sharp
practices w ill have his tun career abruptly
terminated.
In fie judges' stand the popular turf
man, Captain J. W. Rees of Memphis, will
again preside with J. W. Wilson of Sacra
mento as associate judge. Harry .Kuhl
of (Jhieago will act as clerk of the scales
and the nelds will be dispatched by the
efficient California starter, Richard
Havey, whose work with the Australian
gate gave such general satisfaction dur
iae last meeting.
Transportation facilities to the tract
are abundant and thoroughly adequate to
handle the largest crowds. From the
Southern Pacific depot, Third and Town
send streets, trains will pull out at stated
intervals, landing passengers at the tract
entrance. A ticket purchased for $1
carries the bearsr to and from the tract,
as well as admitting him to the course.
The Mission-street line of troliey-cars
nlso runs direct to the track. Manager
Yining of the Market-street Railway sys
tem informed Secretary Leake yesterday
that the cars ot the Mission-street line
wouid run to the track entrance without
transfers after 12 o'clock.
The racing card prepared for tne open
ing day, while not a heavy one. possesses
considerable quality. The Bpecial feature
is the '"Opening day" handicap, over a
mile, for a purse of $1000. In it Damien, a
good performer in the East, makes his
California debut, and if in good form he
and Installator should furnish a rare con
test. In the hurdle event the good
jumper Captain Rees will try the lettle
of California timber toppers. Everything
points to a very large attendance. Thu
lirst race will be called promptly at 2
o'clock.
The track at Oakland was heavy, though
favorites started in well by taking the first
two events, and then outsiders distin
guished themselves by capturing the re
mainder of the card. Reddington, at 7to
1, was the longest priced winner.
By far the prettiest contest of the day
was the seven-furlong handicap, which
dwindled down to a field of four starters.
Through a splendid exhibition of jockey
ship. Tommy Butler brought the light
weighted Peter II in. winner by a neck.
Thebetting was all in favor of Rosebud,
who, with hinety-eigbt pounds up, ruled a
6 to 5 choice, with Sir Play at 9 to 5, also
well supported.
Grady and Peter were the outsiders.
Brown on Sir Play made the running
â when the quartet was dispatched, showing
first until a furlong from the stand. Here
Butler, coming on the inside, challenged
with Peter 11, and in a hard
drive got him past the wire a neck before
Sir Modred filly. The hard-ridden favorite
was third, with ncr head at Sir Play's
saddle-skirts.

field in the opening seven-furlong run
and starting a 1 to 2 favorite packed her
99 pounds to easy victory, after indulg
ing the outsider Tuxedo with the lead
until within close proximity to the wire.
Tne books laid 10 to 1 against the latter
for the place.
The speedy Tea Rose cake-walked away
with the sixand * fcalf furlong jaunt for
two-year-olds. Coupled with her stable
mate, Joy Wheeler, the pair reigned 1 to
2 favorites at post time. Tea Rose made
all of the running, and, with little to
spare, finished less than three lengths in
front of Howard S at the finish. Don
Clarencio could not untrack himself in
the going.
Frank Farrar's brown colt Huenerae
opened a 2 to 1 favorite for the race that
followed, a six-furlong selling ?print, but
there appeared to be nothins: doing in his
direction, and his odds floated back to 3 to
1 or worse.
The judges then replaced Peters with
Snider, and the change of jockeys caused
a rub in the price azain. It worked no
benefit, however, for the son of Sid ran as
tnough he baa wallowed in icecream and
other refresnments, never looking a win
ner. At the end Reddington won gallop
ing from JimÃozeman. Uicardo ran about

win the concluding five and a half iurlong J

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1896.
GENERAL CLUNIE'S
SILVER SPEECH,
Was Delivered Last Night
in Metropolitan
Hall.
The Usual Prediction That Mr.
Bryan Will Carry Cali
fornia.
\
MR. JETER A3 AN ANARCHIST,
Wi linÂ» to Be Classed With Dynamiters
ot This Stateâ Morton and
John P. Irish.
Hon. Thomas J. Clunie was recently
spoken of by W. P. Lawlor at Union Hall
as the best-equipped Democratic speaker
on the stump in California for a discus
sion of the silver question, and at Metro
politan Hall last niebt Mr. Clunie justilied
this opinion, judging from a Democratic
point of view.
The hall was filled, there not being on
empty seat, and standing-room was in
demand.
Gabriel Conn called the meeting to
order and paid a tribute to Charles D.
Lane, George W. Baker and W. P. Lawlor
for their services to the cause of silver.
He introduced Lieuteaant-Governor Jeter
as chairman of the evening. Mr. Jeter
said he had learned all he knew about the
stiver question from W. H. L. Barnes, Irv
ing M. Scott, M. M. Estee and George A.
Knight.
He was grieved to find that his tutors
had deserted the truths that they hail in
stilled into his pure young mind. He de
rided the idea of saying that the sup
porters of Bryan are anarchists, but any
how be was willing to be classed with a
dynamiter like General T. J. Clunie and a
bomb-thrower like 11. E. Church. Us in
troduced Professor J.H.Simmons, who said
that the Republicans are trying to dis
hearten fhe advocates of free silver by cry
' ing that the plan to remonetize silver is
â  impracticable, and said that has been the
way thronjrhout'the world from the be
ginning of time. Whenever anything
new or anything for the benefit of the
people has been proposed there has always
been a small-minded, crooked-backed per
son to say, ''It won't work."
Campaign sones by a quartet from the
Berkeley' University aroused considerable
enthusiasm.
11. E. Church was introduced as a stu
dent of the Hastings Law College. Mr.
Church said lie came from the ereat State
of Nebraska, and described several of the
prominent citizens of that State.
He said: "J. Sterling Morton is to Ne
braska what John l. Irish is to California.
The tail goes with the hide. Both are
insatiable pap-suckers and both are loud
shouters for Grover Cleveland and the
gold standard."
When General Clnnie was happily in
troduced by Air. Jeter the audience fairly
rose to him in enthusiastic applause. As
soon as the demonstration had subsided
he opened his address by savins that he
had teen all over the State in the past
few weeks. From the towns and cities of
the interior he brought tidings of good
cheer and an assurance that Bryan would
come to San Francisco with a majority of
at least 40,000; expecting this great me
tropolis to roll up 10.000 more.
It will be noted that Mr. Clnnie sticks to
the estimate agreed on by the Democratic
Stale Campaign Committee at its meeting
laÂ«t Saturday.
Mr. Clnnie said that it was his privilege
to i eln organize the IMmetallic League of
California, and that in that work he stood
shoulder to shoulder with his friends M.
M. Estee, W. H. Mills, W. H. L. Barnes,
W. S. Barnes and other prominent Repub
licans. Yet to-day he finds that those
zentlemen are no longer with him. He
said that some Republican politicians
would like to deny their former state
ments, but that they are on record in
writing and cannot do so. The editor of
ths Sacramonto Bee, he said, In trying to
advance the cause of free silver, had
written to the leaders of the Republican
party for an expression of opinion. These
letters are now in existence, and General
Clunie said that he had copies of them.
He would quote only one, though all were
of the same import. The letter from M.
H. de Young, editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle, was to the effect that he em
phatically favored "the iree coinage of
gold aud silver."
It was unfair and untrue, the speaker
said, to oall the adherents of Mr. Eryan
repudiators and anarchists; it was onlyfi
short time ago that the Republicans held
to the same oninions that arc now es
poused by the Democrats, iiut he had to
smile at the simplicity of Republican
party managers who annopneed through
the newspapers that they would concede
to Mr. Bryan only 116 electoral votes. Toe
solid South would count more than that.
He said lie called the attention of the
world to the fact that in addition to the
stanch old Democratic voters who have for
years stood together the Bryan forces are
backed by the sterling Fopulitts of the
country who are so much despised by the
plutocrats of the East, and in addition the
honest silver Republicans are supporting
13ryan.
In Sacramento the other day General
Clunie heard a Republican orator de
nouncing the free- trade measures of the
Democrats. He asked the speaker if he
meant the Wilson-Gorman bill when he
spoke of a free-trade measure, and the
speaker admitted that lhat was what he
meant. Mr. Clunie said:
I took him on that point, and told him I had
made a careful examination of the Wilson
(iorman bill rs compared with the McKinley
bill. The McKinley bill imposed a tax of
about 48 per cent on the necessaries consumed
by the peode of tho country. Tne Wilson-
Gorman bill made a reduction ot 8 per cent,
leaving ;i lax of at least 40 per cent, where
upon you shout that we are iree-traders. I
deny if, and I will illustrate what I mean by
thi>- : Suppose one of your acquaintances had
been in the habit of taking forty-eight drinks
of liquor a day, aud in ihe interest ot his
health and decency had resolved to reduce his
consumjrtlon of liquor to forty drinks a day,
would you call that man a tettotaler ?
Mr. Clunie said he had been criticized
by plutocrats for going on the stump and
speaking for the common people, but he
felt that he was justified, as he sprang
from the common people. His parents
were poor and had a hard time to rear
their young family. He had even known
what it was to go to bed hungry, and now
because he was, in the language of the
street, "a little ahead of the hounds. 1 ' he
would not turn his back on the people
with whom he had lived from childhoou
to manhood. He would defy the associ
ated villanies nnd continue to express the
honest views of his heart regardless ot
criticism.
Mr. Clunie said that the rich didn't
care whether you demonetized gold or
silver, just so you make money scarce,
and closed with a prediction that when Mr.
Bryan is elected tnere will be free coinage
of both gold and silver, regardless of the
dictates of England and all other foreign
powers.
Mr. Clunie was frequently applauded,
showing that the people appreciated his
points and arguments as they were pre
sented.
FRAUD IS SUSPECTED.
Collector Wise Sezes Three
Cases ofStatuary Imported
by Waldteufel.
Imported for Church Purposes, yet
Never Delivered to the Proper
Parties.'
The peculiar circumstances surrounding
the importation by Waldteufel & Co. Sep
tember 1 last of five cases of statuary will
be investigated by Collector Wise. The
first step in this direction was taken yes
terdny, when the three remaining cases
were seized and heia subject to lurther in
quiry.
The importation of the statuary has de
! vetoped into a most remarkable ca*e. It
will be recalled that some weeks ago
Achille "Wsldtenfel was found dead in his
parlor. Two days after this event District
Attorney Foote and Collector Wise re
ceived two anonymous letters calling at
tention to the importation Dy Waldteufel
i A: Co. of five cases of stamnry. The writer
alleged that fraud had been committed by
the importer swearing that the articles
contained in the cases were for a church
at Banning, Cal. The law provides that
no dnty shall be collected on any mer
chandise or work of art broueht into this
country for some particular church.
More as a matter of form than anything
else a letter was addressed to the priest at
Manning asking if certain statuary had
been ordered, and if so how many cases.
The reply came back that only two cases
had been ordered from Waldteufel cfc Co.,
and that the same had been received.
Further inquiry developed a very peculiar
state of affairs.
When a Government official called at
the place of Wnldteufel & Co. and asked
about the statuary he was told that it had
been shipped to the parties for whom it
was ordered. They were then requested
to produce the freight receipts, but they
were unable to do this except in the cases
sent to Banning. In the meantime the
officer observed three statues answering
the description of those imported, lie
asked Assistant Appraiser Doolan if he
identified the articles as thoÂ«e examined
August 29, and he replied that he did.
Since that lime the Government has
been making further investigations", with
the result that Collector Wise is now of
the opinion that a gross fraud has been
committed. A strong and determined
| effort is being made to fix the guilt where
it properly belongs. Collector Wise has
secured a specimen of Achilla Waldteu
fel' b handwriting and compared it with
that of the anonymous letter*. To the
non-expert they appear identical, and
there is Jiltle doubt among tho*e who
have charee of the case that Waldteufei
wrote the warning letters.
In the meantime Waldteufel & Co. de
cline to discuss the matter in any way ex
cept to deny that their father had any
thing to do with writing the anonymous
letters.

COLBERT WANTS
BIG DAMAGES
Two Police Commissioners
Included in a Big
Suit.
Chief of Police Crowley and R
P. Hammond Jr. Also
Concerned. -
'3 PLAINT.
Attorney Clarke Thinks $641,000 a
Small Enough Demand on As*
signed Claims.
There was filed in the Circuit Court of
the Ninth Circuit of the Northern District
of California, October 12, a document that
is aimed directly at the arbitrary power
residing in the Board of Police Commis
sioners of this City and County.
The complaint was filed by Attorney
Alfred Clarke in behalf of John H. Col
bert, and is brought against William Al
ford, Chief of Police Crovley, Robert R.
Tobin and 11. P. Hammond Jr., adminis
trator of the estate of R. P. Hammond,
deceased.
The cause of action is given that be
tween the years 1879 and 1892 Colbert was
discharged from the police force without
cause and in violation of the rights se
cured to him by section 1979. Revised
Statutes of the United States. There are
many others concerned in the suit, but
their claims have all been assigned to Col
bert in order to avoid a multiplicity of ac
tions.
The combined damages asked for by
Colbert in his own and the assigned
claims amount to $611,000. This is claimed
to be equivalent to the loss of salary from
time the men were discharged to the pres
ent, loss of position and consequent pros
pect of police pension, counsel fees and
cost of litigation and punitive damages
in the sum of $5000 for each man, because
tne Commissioners' alleged open disre
gard of the fourteenth amendment to the
constitution is claimed to be a matter of
great public and evil example.
Tne whole authority for the suit lies in
Attorney Clarke's interpretation of the
fourteenth amendmentto the constitution,
which forbids any attempt to deprive a
man of properly without due process of
law.
While Commissioner Gunst is not con
cerned in the suit, Attorney Clarke prom
ises that a few matters are going to crop
up shortly that will make things lively
for him also. On what grounds he refuses
to state.
A Hopeful Democrat.
W. H. Alford, chairman of the Demo
cratic State campaign committee, yester
day received a telegram from which he
draws considerable encouragement. The
dispatch is dated at Chicago and is signed
by James Dietrick, formerly a division
superintendent in this State for the South
ern Pacific Company. Mr. Dietrick says
that he has made a canvass of the railroad
men in the principal cities of Illinois and
finds them almost solid for Mr. Bryan.
He thinks the Democratic National ticket
will be carried in Illinois by a big ma
jÂ°rity ' . . .

nefarious operations, the failure of justice In deal^ !
Ing with these conspirators, and | the open organi-

Each candidate Indorsed : by ' the Non-Partisans

rotary, to conduct the affairs of the city economi-
cally, honestly, - and \on business I principles, and

the letter. . . . "
;; Every citizen recognizes the demoralized condi-
tion of our Municipal Government, and will admit
that constant watchfulness . is necessary to samp
out existing abuses and prevent the growth of
others.
Good: officers need their arms strengthened
again*-, schemers and temptation.* and *; faithful
officers are entitled to support; while those : who
fail In their duly, or yield to the debasing Infhi''
ence of the bosses, or to the direct or Indirect
bribes of corporations, should be made to feel ' the
strong arm of the law.
! The Citizens' Kon-Partizan Party's aim is to se-
cure to the City of San ; Francisco a good govern-
ment, and \ for ; this purpose Hi organization will
continue until its aim is accomplished. . '
' Jt is therefore justified i in ; aiking â  the effective
and earnest support, of _ all /citizens or San Fran-
cisco, irrespective of party politics, In its efforts to
secure at the coming election good officers for the
City of San Francisco. "...

NARROW ESCAPE
FROM DISASTER
..The City of Puebla and an
Unknown Bark in
Collision.
Both Vessels Were Considerably
â¢ Damaged, but Were Able
to Continue.
ARRIVAL OF THE PUEBLA.
A Brutal Fight on the Battle-Ship
Oregon Just Before She Sailed
From S.iU-alito.
There was almost another marine disas
ter on the 24th inst. Tne Pacific Coast
Steamship Company's City of Puebla was
in collision, off Otter Point, with an un
. known British bark, but luckily the dam
age wa? not excessive. Had the sailing
| -vessel struck the steamer fair and square
! i roba'ly both would have gone down, and
V " ie loss of life would have been appalling.
â¢The accident took place in a dense lop,
and Captain Debney neither saw nor
heard the bark until she was almost right
': <?n the Puebla.
The captain's account of the collision is
short and to the point. He ssys: "We
.left Victoria, B. C, on the 24th inst., at 10
p. H. When off Otter Point we collided
.with an unknown vessel, supposed to be a
British bark. The bark struck the Puebla
on the ftarboard side, carrying away our
â¢ main and fore rigjrine and snrouds. Over
"thirty feet of the bridge and several
stanchions were carried away, and the
â¢daÂ»vits of the forward boat were started.
The damage to the unknown we could not
ascertain, but the chances are that she
lost hÂ»Â»r bowsprit."
'When the two vessels came together
there was considerable excitement on the
steamer, but Captain Debney and his offi
cers rfssured the passengers that there
..was not the slightest danger and their
'. fears -soon subsided. The bark was hailed
and asked her name. An answer was
given, .but could not be made out. As sbe
continued on her course, Captain iJebney
â¢came to the conclusion she was not dam
.hged to any extent and got under way for
ban Francisco.
As soon as the Puebla was flocked yes
â¢" -te'raay a gang of men were at once put to
â¢ -w"orjfc 'repairing the damage. When she goes
. : out again in a few days it will never be
known that Bbc had ever been in a col
lision.
, The high winds of last Monday night
dreve the river steamer City of Siockton
fen a mud bank and held her therefor
â  "flpur hours. Finally the Dauntless came j
| ong and pulled Her off. This job made

where else. It was pointed out that the
company was now handling all tho
freight of the San Joaquin Valley road
and in consequence had lour of the largest
barges in the bay constantly employed.
The barges come and go at all times of
the tide and in consequence collisions
with the McDowell aru frequent. "Our
expense item on this account alone has
been very heavy," said Superintendent
Hugh J. Corcoran, "and we cannot afford
to be constantly repairing the Govern
ment steamer. The space is badly wanted
for river freight, and I think we should
get it. as one wharf is just as good as an
other for the Government steamer to
dock at."
It was decided to leave the matter in
the hands of Chief Wharfinger Root. He
will confer with army officers and see
what arrangements can be made.
H. A. Rood asked for 300x100 feet of the
inshore side of section Bof the seawall.
Chief Engineer Holmes said that the land
asked for was on the thoroughfare. The
matter was referred to Mr. Holmes to in
vestigate.
The Risdon Iron Works offered to put
the braceÃ in the tower on the ferry depot
for $1550. Mr. Holmes thought the price
was too high and the matter was laid over.
The biggest cylinders ever used in dock
building arÂ» to be put in under Folsom
street wharf. They are six feet in diame
ter and will be driven an extra depth in
order to secure, stability. Rapid progress
is being made in the building of the new
wharf.
Pacific street is now one of the busiest
jon the front. The schooner Annie and
I the ship Roderick Dhu are both loading
for Hawaii and the steamer Mouowai for
Australia. All three take general cargoes
and tnree gangs of men are kept going
irom morning till night.

The Barkentlne Marion Libeled.
The crew of the barkentine Marion yesterday
libeled that vessel in the sum of $2000, alleged
to bo due for wages. It appears from the com
plaint that In April lest the crew signed with
the captainof the Marion foravoyage to Gooks
Inlet and return. A portion of the wages
agreed on were paid, but there still remains
due the sum already mentioned. Captain
Andrews, it seeme, stoppsd off at Cooks Inlet,
sending the ves-cl home in charge of Mate
Walsh. On arriving at this port an effort was
made to comprorrise the matter, but thÂ«
sailors would have nothing to do with such a
proposition hence the libel.

C. S. LAUMEISTER
IS REPUDIATED
Railroad Employes Angry
Over a Trick Played
on Them.
They Denounce the Chronicle
for Convey in? a False Im
pression Yesterday.
OVEE TWC-THIRDS FOR TAYLOR
Secretary Cook Says the Fake Will
Not M?ke Any D fferenca to
the Colonel's Friends.
The few friends of Charles 8. Laumeis
ter, candidate for Mayor, in the United
Railrood Employes' Republican Club are
said to have played a scurvy trick upon
the other members of the club, which has
been exposed by W. C. Cook, the secretary
of the club, who is n personal friend of
Supervisor C. L. Taylor, the Republican
candidate for Mayor, and is doing every
thing he can to secure Ids election.
In yesterday's Chronicle it was stated in
the report of the meeting ot the club at
Mission Parior Hall Monday night that
when the meeting adjourned the men
crowded round Laumeister ami accorded
him a most cordial greeting, every one be
ing eager to grasp his hand, and ail assured
him of their hearty support. This would
lead to the impression that the club was
solid for Laumeister.
"My name ia mentioned as being pres
sent," said Secretary Cook last night, "out
I was not there, and for a very good rea
son. Friends of Laumeister came to me
yesterday and to other members of the
club who are friends of Colonel Taylor and
told us that the meeting had been post
poned. I did not go to the meeting in
consequence, but as I began to think over
the matter it occurred to me as very
strange and I made up my mind to co to
the hall. The meeting had just adjourned
and I saw no one giving Laumeister a
cordial greeting. It is possible he may
have taken some of his friends to a neigh
boring saloon, but the report in the Chron
icle gives the false impression that every
one at the meeting crowded round i:im.
"A private canvass of the members of
the club has been made and over two
thirds have pledged themselves to vote for
Colonel Taylor, which shows how false the
report in the Chronicle is.
"I and other members of the club are
indignant at the 'fake' report in the Chron
icle, but it will not have any effect on
Colonel Taylor's friends in the club."
BAD EASTERN FRUIT.
Measures to Prevent It Being Sold
Under California Labels
The committee of the San Francisco
Fruit Exchange, having in charge tne
matter of packing Eastern fruit under
California labels, has secured the ser
vices of Chickering, Thomas & Gregory
and Gerstle <fc SJosh, who have in turn en
gaced competent attorneys at all the
objec.ive points in the section where this
disreputable traffic is being carried on.
This is not the first year that the practice
has been in vogue, out until now it has
not been done ;o so great an extent or
in such a barefaced and open manner, and
the committee intends there shall be an
end of it.
As a sample of the correspondence re
ceived from honest packers the following
was received from Nashville, Term. :
I find that all through the South these dis
reputable Baltimore packers are putting in
car after oar of "slush" peaches at (!5 cents to
75 per dozen, under California- labels, and I
fee! that some effort should be made to re
strain them, else it will ruin the California
canned-fruit business in the South. The poor
ignorant people who buy this "stuff" suppose
they are getting California fruits, and, disap
pointed, next time they will buy Baltimore
fruits, which will naturally appear better to
ihem than the California article, so-calied. I
think Californians should have a law passed
through Congress making it a crime to label
goods representing them to bo packed in one
State while'actually packed in another. Cer
tain it is, if something is notflone, an irrepar
able rtamaec will be done to the California
canned-fruit business throughout the entire
Southern States.
Young Republicans Awake.
The executive committee of (he Young
Men's Republican League, composed of some of
Vac brightest young stalwarts of tho grand old

The ticket will be issued on Thursday.
MISS ANTHONY ASSURED
Satisfied That the People Will
Adopt Woman Suf
frage.
She Hns Toured the Stata From End
to Ead and Is Confident of the
Popular Vcice.
If the political future seems as well as
sured to others as it does to Miss Susan
B. Anthony in reference to the subject of
woman suffrage, then there are many
skies that are reddened by hope. But
Miss Anthony bases her opinion on per
sonal observation, on conversations with
men and women throughout the length
and bieadth of California, ana on the
very significant fact that in all California
only one organization has decided to op
pose the constitutional amendment which
may confer on women the power to vote.
"I don't see how we can be defeated,"
said Miss Anthony last night, "but," and
Miss Anthony loosed benignantly but de
cidedly throuah her glasses, "if we are
defeated we will go at it asain. After the
campaign is over we will have a grand
rally in this City in Golden Gate Hall,
November 5 and 6. The railroad has
given us regular convention rates, and
women will be here from all. over the
State. On the 7th six of us, the Eastern
emissaries who came out to work in Cali
fornia, will ail journey eastward together.
I have been campaigning tin the Pacific
Coast eight months, and have met with a
variety of experiences. Among other in
cidents I spoke from the rear e:id of a
train down in San Luis Obispo County,
the train stopping ten minutes to enable
me to address the people."
Rev. Anna Shaw addressed a meeting of
printers yesterday at the office of Francis
& Valentine, speaking on the theme that
"No One Class Can Legislate for Any
Other Class." At the close of her address
she received three cheers. Airs. Carrie
Chapman Catt addressed a meeting of
railroad men yesterday, and three cheers
were given by the men for Mrs. Catt and
for woman suffrage.

J?-FW YORK. N. V., Oct. 27.â From a rather
Irregular opening the stock market resumed Its
upward course and lor a time the dealings were
characterized with buoyancy. - The feverishnessat
the start was the result of London selling, higher
rates for money and a falling off in the demand for
wheat. The losses in stocks at this time were in
significant, and before 11 o'clock the entire list
displayed renewed sirengtb. Sugar was the gre\t
feature, and 011 enormous dealings move 1 up to

tracts was the main . factor at work in this stock,
although there was some buying for the account
of lower Wall-street interests. ' " â¢ â

Oakland Wins Her Fight
â for Improvements in
the Harbor.
Aiameda Will Not Get the Canal
;.'. Dredged for Many
Years.
DELEGATES AIL OF ONE MIIUE.
i.First the Harbor, Then the Tidai
Canal, Then the Buildissg of
the Floodgates.
. Oakland Office San Fbaxcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 27. )
The great controversy between the two
cities of Oakland and Alameda has been
settled, and the Secretary of War will soon
receive a report signed by all the duly ap
pointed committees of the conflicting ele
ments. Every effort has been made to
' discover the terms of the compromise, but
tono effect until to-night, when the arti
cleis of agreement were obtained. They
are as follows:
Firat â The completion of the dredging
of .the Oakland harbor before any other
work is done.
Secondâ The completion of the tidal
canal.
Thirdâ The building of the floodgates
ajt the entrance of San Antonio Bay.
This has ended the struggle that has
prevailed between the two cities for sev
eral years. It has caused the getting of
petitions and counter-petitions and the
sending of communications to Washing
. ton, until a few weeks ago the news came
over the wire that all work would cease
until the rival cities could agree on what
was wanted. This threat brought every
body ro time, and a conference was ar
â¢ ranged between committees representing
the Oakland Board of Trade, the City
Council and the Aiameda Board of .Trus
tees.
, " Engineer Poyzer, Health Officer Mc-
Lean and President Forderer represented
Alameda: M. J. Keller, Edson F. Adams
and J. P. Taylor appeared for the Board
of Trade, and a secret meeting %vas held
last Saturday; but not a word could be
wrung from the committeemen, altnough
two cities were interested in it.
The report refers at some length to the
controversy and to the existing conditions
of the harbor, and sums up with the rec
ommendations quoted.
.. As the terms are almost identical with
. what Oakland has fought for it is very evi
dent that Dr. McLean has materially
. altered his views. He has always main
tained that the tidal canal should be
dredged through as a sanitary measure,
and that until this was done the dredgine
done in what is known as Oasland harbor
would fill ud from the tidal canal. The
â plan unanimously approve! provides for
the dredging of Oakland harbor first.
The report will be presented to the City
Council at its next meeting, and will no
doubt be very acceptable. A storm of in
dignation will probably be raised on the
other side of tbe estuary.

ENTRAPPED BY A
SEA CAPTAIN
Two Bunko Men Get a
Free Passage From
Portland.
They Fleeced Two Strangers
From Minnesota Out of
Their Money.
TOOK THEM TO THE STEAMEP.
The Bunko Men Were Detained on
Board and Arrested on the Ves

A Dunko game with sensational incidents
was played upon two young and unsophis
ticated men in Portland last Friday, and
FRANK HOWARD, ALIAS ED PIERSON.
two of the gane are in the City Prison here
on tbe charge of conspiracy.
Alexander White an I Charles White ar
rived in Portland on Friday on their way
to Oregon City to join their uncle, who
has a ranch there. They had $160 with
them. While wandering around waiting
for a train they were approached by two
men who soon gained their confidence and
heard their story.
The strangers advised the brothers not
to go to their uncle and they would find
positions for them to herd cattle at $35 per
month and "found." The prospect pleased
the Whites and they accompanied the two
strangers for a walk across one of the
bridges over the river.
W en they reached a secluded place in
the brush the strangers introduced the
VVhites to the old-time lock game and
they soon parted with $55. They refused
to go on with the game, but before they
could get away three other men made their
appearance. The two brothers were forci
bly held till their pockets were rifled of
$105, the balance of the money they had
with them.
The five bunko men kept them in the
brush tili darkness set in and then re-

crossed the bridge with them. On the
way across the brothers pleaded with
them not to leave them penniless and they
got $10. They were taken to a room in a
house and without any explanation were
locked in.
ThÂ« following night two of the gang
took them out of the room after relieving
them of the $10. They were taken to the
steamer State of California, the two bunko
men giving each a ticket for a passage in
the steerage to this City.
The bunko men were so anxious to see
them off that they remained on board tili
the steamer was about to sail. Meantime
Alexander White had seen Captain Green
of the steamer and told him the story of
being robbed. It was too late to give in
formation to the Portland police, so the
captain refused to permit the two bunko
men to land, much to their discomfiture,
and the steamer sailed away with them
and their victims.
On the passage to this City the bunko
men tried to get the Whites on to the hur
ricane deck at nicht during a storm, and
the Whites believe that if they had cone
they would have been thrown overboard.
When the steamer arrived here yester
day morning the captain notified the po
lice and Detective Graham ana Policemen
Ellis and Dillon went on board and ar
rested the two bunko men. They were
taken to the City Prison, and as soon as

IN A CASKET OF GRAY.
Mrs. a B. Mellersh's Last
Receptacle Was Symbolic
of Youth.
The Deceased Woman Was the Wife
of a Popular S. F. ai.d N. P.
Railway Official.
The sun shone warm and bright yester
day morning and the birds caroled their
sweetest lays, but nature's joyous manifes
tations carried no comfort to the saddened
heart of Thomas Meller^h, one of the most
efficient and popular officials of the San
Francisco and North Pacific Railroad.
It was the occasion of the performance
of the last sad obsequies over the mortal
part of his wife, Harriet B. Mellersh, who
died of consumption at their residence,
814 Bush street, Friday last. Her age waa
but 39 years, and, symbolic of her youth,
the casket was colored an ashen gray.
The impressive ceremony at the family's
residence was conducted by Rev. Dr. Riley
of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, during ibe
course of whicn the antnems, "Hy Cool
Siioam's Shady Kill" ana "Jesus, the Very
Thought of Thee," were sang by a mo
consisting of Mrs. Rullofson, Miss Fletcher
and F. P. Ruyie. The latter also feelingly
rendered "Nearer, My God, to Thee." The
parlors were appropriately draped for the
occasion, while the rooms were filled with
the odor of choice exotics, brought by Mr.
Mellersh's brother officials One huge urn
of flowers owed its presence to President
Foster.
The honorary pallbearers were: R. X.
Ryau, F. R. Zook, W. G. Corbaley, George
HicKox, W. J. McMullen and H. C. Whit
ing. The casket was borne by George B.
Root, F. B. Singley, Denis Maloney, Ed
ward Dunn, Fred Youngberg and liobert
E. Kearon.
The remains of Mrs. Mellersh were tem
porarily laid to rest in the family vault
of Attorney Samuel L. Wilson in* Laurel
Hill Cemetery. It is probable that in time
the body will be s.ipped Last to the home
of deceased at Carlinvilie, 111.
The parents of the d ceased, whose
maiden name was Harriet Biackman Mc-
Ciure, were telegraphed for last Thursday
and arrived in time to be present at the
funeral.
Mr. Mellersh is one of tue most highly
respected officials ol the San Francisco and
North Pacific Railway Company and came
originally from England as a railway ex
pert. He was prominent in railway cir
cles there and married the woman who
bore bis name in 1882. Eigut years ago he
came to California tor his wife's health
and was immediately secured to take the
position he still holds. The couple re
sided as was most convenient for M r. Mel
lersh's labors, he being the secretary and
controller oi the company, either in San
Rafael or this City.
Two children are the result of the
marriage, Harriet Neale and Claude Mel
lersh. Both survive their mother. Dur
ing her long illness it is said that the sick
woman was not only patient and cheerful,
but persisted in performing her manifold
duties as wife and mother till the ravages
of the dread d.sease rendered it impossible.

Enthusiastic Meeting of the Polk-Street
Improvement C!ub at Lodge
Hall.
The Polk-street Improvement Club held
its regular bimonthly meeting at Lodge
Hall last night. Incidentally the occa
sion was taken advantage of to ratify the
great demonstration of Saturday night
last, commemorating the first great vic
tory of the clubâ the placing of electric
lights on Polk street, from Sutter to
Vallejo.
The major portion of the evening was
spent in discussing the present and future
needs of the street. The club now has a
memDership of 185, composed mainly of
storekeepers, and an extra effort will now
be made to have the landlords and prop
erty-holders in general join forces with
these.
It was suggested, though not finally
acted on, that the Polk-street business
guide be issued and distributed among the
residents of the Western Addition. Every
business-house on the street will be listed
alphabetically, and then the objects of the j
club and what it hopes to accomplish will
be set forth in a bnef but forcible man
ner. The idea will probably be favorably
acted on at the next meeting. In con
nection with the proposed guide Mr.
Bibo moved that the second article of the
by-laws, which reads "The improvement
of Polk street,' 1 be changed to read as fol
lows: "'The improvement of Polk street,
promotion of business in general and pro
tection to its members." The motion was
carried with a rousing cheer.
A letter was read from James D. Phelan,
expressing his regret at not being able to
j-articipate in the celebration of Saturday
iiight. The writer said tnat he would
have attended, but for the fact that he is
a candidate for office, and his motives !
would probably have Deen misunderstood.
On motion, the secretary was instructed to
invite Mr. Phelan to address the club at
Its next meetine, for at that time there
would be no political environments to !
hamper him. The club then fixed the j
salary of the secretary at $25 per month,
after which an adjournment was taken.
Within the next week or so the Polk
street Improvement Club will begin an
energetic but consistent warfare for
greater streetcar facilities. The first move
in this direction will be a formal request |
to the Suiter-street Company to allow j
atop-over privileges of at least half an !
hour on any portion of Polk street, north i
of Sutter. In conjunction with this an !
effort will be made to have the company |
put in a cable line in place of the horse-
Cur system now employed from Pacific
avenue to Union street. An effort will |
then be made to effect transfer arrange- I
nients between the Union and Polk street
lines.
â¢In addition to this the club will seek to i
have all cross cable lines north of Sutter ]
street transfer to Polk street. It is be
lieved that the California Company will
readily agree to such an arrangement,
though there is some doubt as to how Mr.
Vining's corporation would view such a
proposition. President Kahn is confident,
however, that in time such an arrange
ment will be in operation.

immediately following the executive com
mittee and indorsed the action of the
committee as far as it had reported. The
committee on personal property tax
evil" reported that it bad made a canvass I
among the banks and had found them in !
perfect accord with the idea sought to be
gained by the association. Two more
nrms were added to the association.

JAMES D. PHELAN
ROUNDLY SCORED
.He Is Declared to Be ai
Egotist Without an
Equal.
Patrick J. Reddy Ridicules His
Claims as a Candi
date.
HIS AUDIENCE WAS AMUSED.
TJjis Occurred at a Large Meeting of
Citizens Called to Oppose the
New Charter.
<â  An anti-charter meeting was held at
Union Hall, on Howard street, last even
ing. There were three speakersâ Patrick J.
Reddy, Joseph I. Dimond and ex-Judge
J.F.Sullivan. The principal speech of
the evening was made by Mr. Reddy, who
waxed sarcastic at the expense of James
D". Phelan, and the audience laughed
: heartily at the points he made.
Mr. Reddv spoke of Mr. Phelan's readi
ness to take office under the charter, bad
as it is, as an indication of a fevered
Understanding and immaturity. He ridi
culed the idea tbat Phelan would be able
to accomplish more than his many prede
cessors in the office of Mayor, and said
tbat as an egotist he has no equal.
Phelan must be a most wonderful man
if' he can accomplish what he believes
he can. "Phelan said that he will
reform the system of taxation," said Mr.
Reddy. "Perhaps he will do that in one
particular. He may put in his own prop
erty for taxation at its full cash value."
Mr. Reddy also said that Mr. Phelan
would not "help tbe poor men by reducing
taxation, for that reduced revenue and
would reduce employment.
J. S, Bannerman called the meeting to
order and made a few preliminary re
marks complimentry to Joseph I. Dimond.
He incidentally made a hit at James D.
Phelan, saying that in this contest for the
mayoralty "wealth has made itself felt."
A .list of vice-Dresidents was read, after
â¢â¢which Patrick J. Reddy was introduced.
Mr. Reddy said that in a lew days the
people would be called upon to choose be
tween the existing government and an
entirely new form of government which is
proposed by the new charter. The peo
ple would ask themselves whether they
â¢conld not live under the consolidation act
until a board of freeholders could be found
who would be competent to frame!
a charter which would be properly pre- j
'jjared. There was no doubt that it was
possible to live under the consolidation
act for a time.
â¢ "At the head and front of the pro-char- j
ter forces stands Mr. Phelan. He looks !
well notwithstanding the hideousness of j
this act under which we live, and the Mer
chants' Association of this City, so far as
they are represented in this association,
have all done well under that consolida
tion act.
"They continued to do well until by the
narrow-minded policy and the moral cow- j
ardice that, has stamped their advocacy of
the proposed new charter they became in
competent to mind their own business.
They have stood and allowed themselves j
,to be trampled under foot bj'the railroads !
without a protest, and now they try to lay j
the blame upon the consolidation act.
Whetever there is of want of prosperity
in this community lies at the door of tha
incompetent band of men who now come
forward and lay the blame upon the laws.
"Why, the consoiidation act is not to
blame. No form of government can pos- !
sibly aid these men, because, like the j
new charter, they will have to be amended j
before they can be successful."
The speaker was here interrupted by
the entrance of a Democratic club with a
brass band, at the close of which Joseph I.
Dimond stepped on the staee amid three
cheers proposed by Mr. Reddy.
"Bad as this consolidation act is de
clared to be," continued tbe speaker, "we
find tbat Mr. Phelan is perfectly willing
to take office under it. [Laughter.]
"It is said tbat it has been so confounded
and so confused by amendments that no
one can tell what powers public officers
have. Then no one should undertake the
task. [Applause.]
"But it is said the only reason Mr.
Phelsn has to sacrifice himself for this
public office is that he thinks, even
under the consolidation act, he can do
something for this City which has never
been done by any man before him. This
seems to me to be the result of a fevered '
imagination â tbe zeal of youth that}
usually accompanies a man who is inex
perienced. [Laughter and anplau^e.]
"What lie will or can do under this con
soiidation act he has forgotten to explain.
He has the most convenient way of for
getting things of any young gentlemen I
ever saw. [Uproarious laughter.] How
ever, despite all this, he is going to wipe
out all the luster of the great names
which lam about to read to you." [Mr.
Reddy read off a list of the Mayors ot the
City from Kalloch to Sutro.]
"This younc man," he continued, "is to
come in and do things under this consoli
dation act which none of these great chiefs
were able to accomplish. [Laughter and
applause.] This is a most wonderful I
young man. As an egotist Ido not Know
anybody that excels himâ no, that even I
comes within a mile or two of him. He is I
simply outof sight. [Uproarious applause,
mingled with laughter ana cries of 'give it
to him.']
"Mr. Phelan says that he will be able to
and will inaugurate a system of reform in
taxation. That is a fine promise and by
putting in his own property at its full cash
value he will be able to do it. [Wild
cheering.]
"He says that he will reduce taxation. I
have no doubt tbat he will be perfectly
willing to do that, and so are nearly ail
the men who possess vast property. .[Ap
plause.] That is what the corporations
are trying to do now." (Bannerman here
arose and proposed three cheers for Di
mond, given with a will, while the band
struck up "See, the Conquering Hero
Comes.")
"Now, Mr. Phelan says that he is going
to reduce taxation. In other words, the
revenue which will go into the City's
treasury will be greatly reduced. Thereby
he is going to help his friends, the labor
ine men, out of their troubles.
"Now, how does that strike you? Will
he not reduce the chances of the laboring
men for employment? Unquestionably.
"How many are there of the laboring
nien that rely upon their hands for a liv
ing in tbis City who are burdened by taxa
tion? You will not find one in a thousand
who has ?50M. It seems to me that help
ing the poor man is out of the question in
this case. That is merely vii* point
.where Mr. Phelan is going ta serre the
people and Mr. Phelan at tbÂ« same time.
[Applause.]
"Now, he says he is going to make public
improvements. Evidently he expects to j
improve more rapidly than he has hereto
fore. But, I say, how can he, if he is
going to cramp the public revenue?
Under such a parsimonious administration
he would have no chance to make public
improvements of any kind, no matter how
good his wilh His will seems as un
bounded as bis wealth.
"If there is a tax upon property, the
money which pours into the City's coffers
will be drawn out for the benefit of the
poor man. Stop that revenue and you
will stop the pay of the poor man. [Ap
plause.]
"vVhat interest has the poor man in
this particular piece of business tbat Mr.
Phelan proposes? What interest has he,
who, after paying his bills and furnishing
his family, has to walk to his work on Mon
day morning because he has not a 5-cent
piece to pay his fare.
"It must be conceded that under this
consolidation act which has been attacked
by the pro-ctiarter men â it must be ad
mitted, I say â that a grand City has been
established here under its provisions;
that it is as prosperous outside of the par
ticulars I have named as any city that
can be found in the United States; tnat
its officers, who have been elected by the
people of this community, have been
generally men of honor and integrity. I
speak of no particular man now. But
from the beginning to the end I have
been informed tnat only two in the his
tory of this City have defaulted, and
their defalcations were made good.
"Men who are attempting to publish to
the world that this is the most corrupt
city in the United States are simply
libeling the City and its Kovernmenu
"These men say you must lay all this
aside because there has been some corrup
tion. You must give up your elective
franchise and place all the elective rower
in the hands of one man. 1 leave you to
judne for yourselves.
"If amendments have destroyed the
original consolidation act what will be
come of this sickly little charter which
needs the aid of a doctor before it was
adopted? The consoiidation act enabled
the people to take part in public affairs
and to elect officers to administer their
affairs. It was proposed to place the
power in the hands of one man. That
had been tried in Chicago. The. iirst
Mayor of Chicago under that plan was
honest. The second Mayor was assassi
nated. The next Mayor went into office
a poor man and emerged worth $1,500,000.
It would not do to listen to the siren song
which is sung that under the proposed
new charter San Francisco could, be sure
that it would always have a good Mayor."
Mr. Reddy continued that the consoli
dation act kept the teacher in the public
schools in office during good behavior.
An editorial in the Examiner showed that
while tbat paper might know something
about ilanna, it did not know anything
about the school law of this State. He
had been assailed by the Examiner. He
was sure that his record was as firm as
tbat of the Examiner. His principles
were as fully grounded. He was not
speedy enough to keep up with the
lightning changes of the Examiner. He
wss sure that he was justified as fully In
taking retainers in law cases as the Ex
aminer was to derive revenues from
massage advertisements and others of a
similar character.
The Examiner should shut up shop on
the school question or hire a lawyer. It
should learn the difference between con
tracts made with a board of trustees and
teachers hired by a Board of Education.
The changes in the proposed charter were
devised to make a sweep and to put the
power practically in the hands of the
Mayor. The Examiner's statement that
the teachers would ba out of employment
next June 30 if the new charter should not
be approved would not scare the teachers
into support of the charter.
The charter embraced the idea of cen
tralization, the creation of a greater boss
than ever was known by placing all the
paironage of the City in his bands. He
would be the boss of all the bosses and
they would have to truckle to him.
Louis XIV was accustomed to say, "I am
the state." Under this proposed charter
the Mayor of San Francisco could say, "I
am the City." If he should be a man
without conscience he could so handle
the paironage as to hold on in office in
definitely. The charter would supersede
the general law, and the schools, whicli
have their foundation under the general
law, would therefore go out as an entirety.
The charter provided for a complete sys
tem of schools of its own. There could
not be a dual system. Under the charter
ail the school officers from the Superin
tendent down would be wiped out. What
was the use of saying that the teachers
would be protected by laws which the
charter would wipe out? The system of
schools provided for in the charter is
totally unlike the one provided for under
the general laws. The provision that no
one should teach in the public schools
who was not educated in the public schools
of San Francisco was a measure devised
by the A. P. A. The plan was to put out
all the Catholic teachers.
Some confusion arose at this point.
There were cries of "Diraond," which
made it difficult for Mr. Reddy to pro
ceed. Chairman Bannerman came to the
front of the stage and cailed the audience
to order and read them a little lecture.
"The trouble with meetings of this kind
is that they will not listen to the facts.
They want Greek fire, red tire and other
pyrotechnics. I must ask you to listen to
Mr. Reddy."
Mr. Reddy continued and said that the
"best citizens" would, he hoped, consider
fccis.
Joseph I. Dimond spoke very briefly.
He said that this was an anti-charter
meeting. He had only a few remarks to
make. He was strongly ODposed to the
charter. He wished to strongly deny that
he wan the tool of a boss. He had never
been bossed. He accepted the nomina
tion for Mayor on the one condition con
tained in the oath of office only â to do his
duty. He had no doubt that he would be
elected the next Mayor of San Francisco.
Ex-Juoge Sullivan said that he would
never be untrue to the blood that flowed
in his veins, or to the faith that had ex
isted for nineteen hundred years. He
then suoke in a complimentary way of
Mr. Dimond. "Let no man come before
the public and say that the Catholic
priesthood is trying to regulate the votes
of Catholic citizens.
"Every vote cast for Mr. Phelan is a
vote for Ihe new charter. 1 wish to say
to you, my friends and neighbors, who
have known me since I was 10 years of
age, 1 noticed in the press a statement
that Mr. jfhelan had been named first
among the number of names of those who
advocated the adoption of the new char
ter. Do you want that charter adopted?
[Hisses and yells of 'No!' and 'Nit!']
"I do not want it adopted. I want peo-
Dle of my kind respected for their worth,
but if the question were entirely removed
Irom this municipality, and a man was
out battling, with all the powers at
his command, saying to his fellows,
'I am for this charier, and if 1
am elected Mayor I will go to
Sacramento, and use my best efforts to
have the Legislature vote for it â I say if
you vote for that man you are voting for
something that is antagonistic to all the
feelings I have, at least, and to the feel
ings I think the people ot my kindred
and my creed holi dear."
A WANDERING CLUB.
The Latest Addition to the City Cycling
Organizations.
The latest entry to the circle of local
cycling clubs is the Wanderers, which or
ganized en October 16. The membership
is limited to twenty and clubrooms have
been established at Nineteenth and Guer
reio streets.
The club is made up of enthusiastic
wheelmen who don't care to scorch, who
won't stick to weH-known roads, however
good, but who liko to roam from plaje to
place whenever a reasonable good road
stretches before them, caring little for
place, time or distinction, and only look
ing for a new place to drive their wheels.

NO MORE FREE
FROSTED CAKES
Jealousy Among the Ladies
Makes Trouble for
the Bakers.
German and American Master
Breadmakers Associ
ated.
OTHERS KOT IN THE UNION.
Decisive Action to Be Taken at tbe
Meet nj of the Association
To-Morrow.
The question to be decided at to-mor
row's meeting of the Master Bukers' Asso
ciation is, whether the customers of the
ninety-five German and American bakers
in this City will receive on Christmas eve
tbe accustomed cake with its frosted sur
face and last rose of summer, or the
frosted go-by, without either cake or rose.
At a meeting of the Master Breadmakers
on Monday night a resolution was adopted
denouncing tha making of Christmas
presents in future. This resolution will
come up for final action at to-morrow's
meeting of the association.
The reason for the bringing up of the
resolution at this time means tbat should
it be adopted the customary Merry Christ
mas cake, which heretofore was presented
to every family who patronized the in
dividual baker, will remain in the store to
be sold like its fellows for cash, not good
will.
One of the knights of the flour bin, Nich
olas Frost, president of the Master Bak
ers' Association, said:
"I has cost me between $400 and $500
every Christmas to give presents to my
customers, and in the majority of cases
general dissatisfaction follows. No two
families appreciate their presents alike.
The cake is either too small or not rich
enough, and tbe one the other got was so
much better and larger than the one
which came home to each. And as a con
sequence I lose customers every Christ
mas.
"The best and only way to settle the
trouble is to abolish the entire custom,
which I think we will do at tbe meeting
to be held Thursday.
"In this association the German and
American bakers only are represented.
The Italian and French bakers have an
association of their own, which prohibits
the iving of presents.
"Our association has had this subject
under consideration for some time, but
for some reason or other it was put off
until now. when the approach of Christ
mas makes it imperative to take definite
action one way or ihe other. Ir the asso
ciation should reject ihe resolution about
to be brought up for final action it would
perhaps result in leaving things just as
they are.
"But the habit of presenting a cake to
every customer is expensive to the baker
and unprofitable in the end, as it makes a
good deal of discontent, without pleasing
those whom it was intended to make
happy and cheerful."
In addition to this question of free cake
the other and perhaps more important
one to small and poor storekeepers is that
of declining to take back the stale bread
wh?ch has been left on the hands of cus
tomers.
Tne meeting to-morrow will handle
those two very weighty questions of
"stale bread and free frosted cake."
THE DIVORCE COURTS.
Seven Mismated Couples Were Sepa
rated Yesterday.
Joseph Dilhan, the riding-master, was
yesterday granted a divorce from Grace
A. Dilhan, and so ends a case that some
time ago furnished the community with a
hearty laugh.
The couple came here from Portland
several years ago and started a fashionable
riding academy on Pacific avenue. Sub
sequently Dili. an deserted his wife and
went to live at the home of a lriend. Mrs.
He has attended every municipal and
State convention since 1881 and has al
ways given his time, money and best
energies in advancing tho principles of the
party. Mr. Bettman was a member of the
last Legislature, and was active in secur
ing the defeat of the bill repealing the fee
bill, which saves to the taxpayers about
$40,000 a year, which otherwise would
have gone into the pocket of the Sheriff.
He also voted for the bill granting to the
Valley Railroad Company the lease of
China basin, thereby giving to the people's
competing railroad an entrance into San
Francisco.
Mr. Kett man's record during the session
of the .Legislature is marked by an honesty
of purpose that distinguishes him among
his fellows and which gathers about him
now in his candidacy for re-election a host
of friends, who are working valiantly and
have already made his election sure.
Dilhan then sued the harborer of her
SDOUBB for $10,000 damages for alienating
his affections.
Since that time the Jady has reconsid
ered the matter and recently she went
East and forgot to enlighten Mr. Dilhan
as to ber destination. He has in conse
quence secured a decree of divorce.
Judge Sanderson granted Mabel Val
Poole a divorce from A. Laurice Val
f oole on the ground of failure to provide.
Saran I/. Moore was divorced from
Frank P. Moore by Judge Hunt because
of the defendant's" infidelity.
Willful neglect was the cause of the di
vorce Judge Hunt granted Hattie U.
Meighan from Thomas P. Meighan.
Abigail Maxwell was freed from Wyman
Maxwell by Judge Seawell on the ground
of desertion.
Judge Daingerfield granted Annie Wal
cott a divorce from Eugene W-Walcott be
cause of tbe lutter's licsertion.
Mme. Nordica.
The manager of Mme. Lillian Nordica has
been in town for the past few days trying to
arrange a date for the great prlma donna. On
account of the expense attached to bringing
the artiste here none of the musical or otner
societies have cared to take bold of the matter
until they could see their way clear. It is
proposed to open a subscription list at Sher
man, Clay & Co.'s for the next two days, and
if enough subscriptions are made the artiste
will come.
LESSON OF A BUSY LIFE
T. B. Valentine, the Pioneer
Printer, Passes to His
Rest.
He Attributed His Marked Success in
Life to His A'tention to Busi
ness and Economy.
Thomas B. Valentine, the well-known
capitalist, prominent as the founder and
president of the printing firm known as
the Francis-Valentine Company, died in
his apartments at the Baldwin Hotel at
7:30 a. M. yesterday of cancer of the
stomach, with which he has been suffering
for several years.
Unaware of the nature of the dread
disease which was slowly sapping away
his life until a few days ago, h* found it
necessary to submit to an operation per
formed by Dr. Taylor.
It was seen that his case was hopeless
from the start, and soon after the opera
tion he became unconscious, remaining so
with the exception of onp hour's con
sciousness Monday evening, wben he again
relapsed into a comatose Mate and sank
rapidly till tbe hour of his death.
At his deathbed were present: Mrs.
Valentin", his wife; S. D. Valentine, his
brother; and Mrs. N.T.James,
Mr. and Mrs. H. H. Noble and Dr. Taylor.
Deceased was numbered among the
pioneers, as he came to California in 1851.
He was born iv New York and was 65
years old.
On hiÃ arrival in California he branched
forth m tbe real estate line, the venture
being attended with uniform success.
About this time he is said to have secure-l
the rights to a Mexican land grant of
many thousand acres. Petaluma now
stands upon this tract. In the litigation
following the pressing of his claims he
established his ownership so fully that
the Government was obliged 10 issue him
certain script empowering him to settle
in surveyed and unsurveyed Government
land no matter where he found it.
Accordingly he loca'ed on thousands of
acres of lÂ»nd in the State, now very valu
able. Among the vast landed intere"sts he
left are the Corte Madera ranch, situated
near San Rafael, and containing several
thousand acres: the Mahoney mine on
Suiter Creek and several Sacramento River
islands.
In 1855 he founded a printing establish
ment in San Francisco with Mr. Munson,
under the firm name of Valentine & Mun
son. His interest was purchased in 1863
by D. B. Francis 8. D. Valentine was
then a partner, and, on his brother selling
out his interest, the name of the rirm was
changed to Francis & Valentine.
This was further metamorphosed into
the Francis-Valentino Company when the
firm was incorporated about one year ago,
and deceased was elected president.
The issuance of that script to Valentine
rendered his fame world wide. A portion
of it was sold to speculators, one of them
creating a sensation about a year ago by
locating on property in Chicago worth
millions of collars. The claim being con
tested is still in litigation.
Valentine was manied twice, but
leaves a widow without children. He was
very industrious and economical. He
used to any that no man could hope for
success in life otherwise. Arrangements
for the funeral are now being made, and a
private interment will be had at Cypress
Lawn Cemetery on Thursday.
HOW TO VOTE OH
THE AMENDMENTS
Proposed Changes in the
Constitution Are Im
portant
Number Three Is Bad and Ought
to Bs Overwhelmingly
Defeated.
TO DECIDE WC MAN SUFFRAGE
"Shall the Ladies Vote?" Is Oce of
ihe Burning Questions of the
Campaign.
The proposed amendments to the State
constitution have received but little atten
tion from the newspapers and platform
speakers during the present campaign, for
the reason that the interest of the people
has been more thoroughly aroused in re
gard to the success or defeat of National
and municipal nominees.
Changes in the fundamental law of the
commonwealth are necessarily of impor
tance to the people, and a brief review of
the alterations suggested is opportune at
the pieaent moment.
The proposed amendment designated as
amendment No. 1 in the official procla
mation issued by Governor Budd and Sec
retary of State Brown relates to the ex
emption of mortgages from taxation. This
is a subject that received a great deal ot
attention in the convention tbat framed
the new State constitution. The majority
of that body decided that the tax on mort
gages must be paid by the mortgagee.
The proposition before thje people is to
undo that part of the convention's work,
and this has caused considerable discus
sion.
Those who favcr the amendment con
tend that the change would benefit the
borrowers of the State. They argue that
under all circumstances the oorrower must
ultimately and in fact pay the tax on
the mortgage, for the reason that
the lender protects himself against
loss on account of his expenditure
for the tax by increasing the rate of in
terest. To substantiate this position, at
tention is called to the fact that the aver
age rate of interest advanced throughout
the State after the adoption of the State
constitution in 1879.
Opponents of the proposed amendment,
whi.e admitting that there was a slight
advance of the rate of interest after the
adoption of tho new constitution, assert
that the time that has since elapsed has
equalized and minimized the rats of in
terest that lenders are willing to accept, go
that borrowers now bear no burdens that
may possibly be shifted to other shoulders;
that the lender now pays the tax on the
mortgage, and that if this requirement be
abandoned the borrower will still be com
pelled to pay the tax on his property at
least for the lull amount of the mortgage,
and will have no assistance from ihe
mortgagee in the shape of the mortgage tax
as at nresent.
Amendment No. 2 proposes to provide
for the use of voting machines if satisfac
tory apparatus be offered and provided by
the constituted authorities. Several in
ventions intended to secure this end have
been patented, and some of them are said
to have beeD successfully operated.
Amendment No. 3 is intended to limit
the liability of stockholders in incorpo
rated companies. The lunguage ot tbe
amendment is as follows:
The liability of stockholders of corporations
or joint-stock associations shall be li mi led by
the face value of the shares of the subscribed
capital stock or shares of such corporation or
association; and whenever any shares have
been fully paid up the holder of sum shares
shall not be further liable to such corporation
or association, or the creditors thereof, 011 that
account. Each stockholder of a corporation or
joint-stock association, whose capital stock is
not fully paid up, shall be individually and
personally llabl.v lor such proportion of all its
debts and liabilities contracted or incurred
during tbe time be was a stockholder or share
holder, as the amount unpaid upon the stock
or shares owned by him bears to the whole
amount unpaid upon the subscribed capital
stock or shares of the corporation or associa
tion. The directors or trustees of corporations
and join trS lock nssociations shall be jointly
and severally liable to the creditors ana stock
hol ten for all moneys embezzled or misap
propriated by the officers of such corporation
or joint-stock association (lining the term of
office of such director or trustee.
Tbis is so important and is fraught with
so much danger to tbe general public that
it is published in full. It is not considered
that making tho directors or trustees
responsible would protect the public
against the organizers of fraudulent cor
porations. It would be possible to put up j
dummy directors or trusteej, behind
which wealthy but unscrupulous stock
holders might hide and escape financial
responsibility with even greater safety
than under the present law.
Amendment No. 4 is intended to give
I ome rule to San Francisco and will be
supported by all who are not in favor of
going to the Legislature for general laws
that are intended to apply to this City,
, but which no one can be sure will reach
the necessities of this community.
Amendment 6 is simply to enforce the
female suffrage issue, in favor of whicn
The Call has already spoken with so
much force. Those who believe that the
ballot should be given to the women will
vote for this amendment. The only pro
posed change from the present lav.' is thÂ«
omission of the word "male," in defining
the qualifications of electors in this State.
The issues thus placed before the people
are already outlined and are easily under
stood. Voters who wish to vote intelli
gently on the questions presented will be
able to comprehend the entire situation
by five minutes' study of the amendments
taken in connection with this article.
