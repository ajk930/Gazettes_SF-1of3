A Chain of Suspicious Circum
stances That Make Assur
ance Doubly Sure.
WHAT MEDICAL MEN FCUND.
J ke Raver's L.vcly Chase After the
C rtificate cf Deposit for Ten
Thousand Dollars.
Excitement about the raw decision of
Wyatt Earp. the bodyguard of "Long
â  Green" Lawrence of the Examiner, is in
creasinir rather than diminishing among
lovers of honest Bport as the facts of the
transparent conspiracy are being dragged
' .to the surface.
â â -'â¢â¢ It is now said that Earn had been se
â¢â¢; â¢ lected as "the dark horse" for referee long
before the tight, and long before the peo
ple had any idea that there was the re
'â¢;. . jnotest chance that San Franciscans of un
'blemislted reputations, who had been con
;.. ' neaped with boxing and other athletics for
â¢ years and years, would be turned down,
/": and a faro-dealer and gunfighter from
.â¢â ..Arizona or anywhere else would be se
'...' Jected in their stead.
â¢:;./. B, nee the developments which have
'. been made during tbe past twenty-four
hours additional significance attacties to
. the fact that Referee Earp went into the i
' â  â  ring with a navy revolver a foot long j
' sticking out of his hip pocket.
... Mr. Earp is no fool. He knew that he i
â¢ .."was in a civilized community; that the j
.: boxing contest had the sanction of the au- {
â  thorities; that the spectators â the major- |
". â¢ ityof the spectators â were respectable and
â¢ .influential business men of this t)ity and
â¢'â  State, and that they had assembled for
.'..the purpose of witnessing a contest of
..';. skill, agility, endurance and bravery be
Â«. 'tw.een two men who claimed to be rivals lor
. ' â¢ .fhe w.orid's championship in the art of
â¢ '.self-defense.
â¢â¢ "He knew that the betting was a sec
... .ondary consideration, as it is and should
". be in all matters of sport, and a device to
â ' .'ftiye more zett to th 6 occasion, and he knew
' that.no matter what decision he might
give sj lont; as it bore frbe color of hon
esty and fairness, would be acquiesced in
â¢ ' -and that his person wonid be as safe from
. violence and his personality as sacred
f-rom insult as that of the Mayor of the
. . City.
Then why did he go into the ring with
the frontier revolver under his coat tails?
That is a question which nr any people
are asking and answering in 'a manner not
â  ..complimentary to the referee and the
gang which secured him that position.
â¢' Th.ey argue that the referee armed him
. ?elf as though he were in an uncivilized
â  community, and that tbe reason why he
â¢ â¢ -.did so must have been, or appeared to be,
because he feared that his decision would
â¢ " evoke such a storm of indignation that he
. ' would subject himself to be assaulted by
â  the persons whom that decision would rob.
. " The whole affair reeks with suspicion
against Earp and his friends.
. One of his most intimate friends, the
' man who recommended Earp for the po
â  sition and who did as much as, if not more,
' than any other person to secure his being
selected as referee, is Andy M. Lawrence, â 
familiarly known as "Lonsr Green Law- 1
. rence," managing editor of the Examiner.
Why was Long Green so anxious to have
Earp referee the fight?
Manager Julian says that from the very
â¢t.â¢ t . start the Sharkey people, and particularly
. Mr. Lynch, objected to any person named
"... as referee by the Fitzsimmons people or
â¢'â¢ by disinterested individuals, and insisted
â¢' that the club should name the referee.
..Mr. Julian mentioned such well-known
. gentlemen as Hiram Cook of the Olympic
â¢; "Club and Mr. Fulda of the Athletic Club,
. both o! whom have acted as referees in
scores of glove contests. Lynch refused to
entertain their names for a moment and
â¢ â¢ fyially *aid that he would not accept any
: man nauied by Julian; that he desired the
.club to appoint the referee. Finally he
named three or four h(rsemenand race
track frequenters whose names were un
familiar to Julian and in boxing circles.
â "â¢â¢ Then he cut the interview short with the
declaration repeated that the referee
â¢. ' should be a man selected by the club.
Lynch T s persistence on this point is re
.parded as another suspicious circum
. stance taken in connection with the
others.
'. He trusted implicitly to the club. Such
childl'ke â nay, lamblike â confi lence is
seHom found to rule the breasts of mana
gers of pugilists. Lynch was evidently
willing to accept any man whom the c'.ub
might select, and this extraordinary and
â¢',.â¢ unusual willingness, this eagerness al
nfo*t,.to purchase a pig in a poke, shades
â¢Lynch's conduct in a suspicion so deep
.that it- is very doubtful whether he will
* eve,r be able to swim out of it.
. â¢ Even the Examiner, managed by "Long
Green" Lawrence, did not say that
Sbarkfy was fouled, rmt published the
'report in a half-hearted way.
'â¢Mr. Hamilton and Mr. N&uzhton. who
' yttote special accounts of the CgUt, do not
.â¢â â¢ay that fcjharkey was struck a foul blow.
'Jin Naughton begins his retort with tbe
' statement that if Fitzsimmons fouled
.HLark-py he (Nau^hton) did not see it
â  M.r. Hamilton did not see it either, and j
" '/contents himself with facetiously calling
: .attention to the dexterity with which

"limters Mjd discharges the swivel gun
I .iarngiiii; at his belt, and suggests that ad-
I â  c'rse criticism would be il!-advised in the
V;;iceof that formidable piece of portable
artillery.
The big odds of 3 to 1 offered by sport
ing "men who were well acquainted with
the capacity of both pugilists was the great
temptation rÂ«l<ied to the purse of $10,00)
-which actuated the conspirators. In the
face of those unusual odds against his

man Danny Needham telegraphed to
friends in different parts of this State and
of the United States to bet all they could
on SharKey; that he was a sure winner.
Of course he was. That matter had
been arranged beforehand, and Sharkey
couldn't have lost. With a purse of !
$10,000 for a starter, $30,000 bet in the pool
rooms at the average odds of 3to 1. be
side thousands of dollars in private betÂ« in
the hands of private stakeholders the !
game was too large and too rich to be :
allowed to escape, when a little mauipu- j
lation, a little whispering In the dark and
a little well-groomed judgment on the
part of the referee, with a newspaper to
stand brhind the decision, were all that
was necessary to capture the prize.
Men foremost in the community, of
undoubted integrity and veracityâ not a
few of such men, but hundreds of them â
have denounced and continue to denounce
the decision as one of the most bare-faced
robberies tliat has ever been perpetrated
in this State under the guise of sport.
SHARKEY'S INJURY.
It Is a Common Complaint Among
Athletes, Caused by Overex
ertion or Exhaustion.
Added to the preponderance of evidence
that Fitzsimmons did not foul Sharkey is
the fact, vouched for by medical men,
acrobats, bicyclists, wrestlers and other

athletes, that Sharkey's present physical
condition is very common among ath
letes following overexertion. It is more
frequent among persons subject to vari
cose veins than those wr.o are not afflicted
with this tendency, and it is now known
that Sharkey is suffering with varicose
veins :n his legs, caused by the exertion
of the fight.
Dr. P. J. H. Farrell, a reputable physi
cian, who was present at the fight, gives
strong testimony in favor of Fitzsimmons.
Dr. Farrell is a lover of honest sports and
has seen many contests of skill and en
durance between men, and his r pinion is
worth more than that of ascoce of men
| who have not had bis experience. The
j doctor said to a rej-orter that he went to
the fisht with all his sympathies on the
side of Sharkey, but that he became dis
gusied with his foul tactics before the end
of the second round.
He believed Sharkey to be the worst
kind of a coward. Every time that Shar
key was l.it he lost his temper and seemed
to desire hia revenue in any way he couid
get it. He seemed to be indifferent as to
the kind of revenge he took, edded the
doctor. He fouied Fitzsimmons in a low,
brutal way more than a dozen times.
Then the speaker added :
"I am reliably informed that Sharkey
has been suffi-ting irom varicose veins, a
condition that would make him very sus
ceptible to any strain or overexertion.
Never have I seen a man struck below the
belt fall in the manner in which Sharkey
fell. Had Ftzsimmons struck him in the
region where tne â¢weiitna is now Sharkey
would have beta black and blue for weeks
afieiward, but the discoloration is very
slirht."
It is n fact which will be vouched for by
medical men that a swelling such as Shar
key exhibits could be caused by a hypo
j dermic injection of iodide of potassium
lor other poisonous substance. But it
would not be nefessary to resort to this
operation in the case of a man suffering
from varicose veins.
WALTER WATSON'S IDEA.
The Knockout as Graphically De
scribed by the Boxing Instructor
for the Olympics.
Walter Watson, boxing instructor for the
Olympic Ciub, in a letter to The Calt,
gives the following account of the termi
nation of tbe fight as he saw it:
To Ike Editor oj the CallâSin: At the request
of Mr. Geary I send you a few lines describing
the finish of the Fitzsimmons-Sharkev fl^ht. I
saw Fitz cross SharKey with his right. He
then changed his position, bringing his left
foot to the rear aud his left shoulder well
back, and nppercut with the left hand, at the
same time guarding his face with the right.
This blow, as far as I could see, Unaed in
the stomach, and the blow brought Sharkey's
head forward. Pitz used the same uppercut
again and landed ou the chin.
Walter Watson.
WHERE IS THE CHECK?
A Difference of Opinion as to the
Fruits of the Fight.
One of the most interesting phases of
the squabble over the fight that devel
oped yesterday was the fact that there
seems to be a serious doubt as to the
whereabouts of tho famous $10,000 certifi
cate of deposit which represents the re
muneration of Sharkey.
Every one, including Sharkey, supposed
of course that Danny Lynch had it, but it
now appears that he has not, or at least
he says so.
When Fitzsimmons' case on order of
examination was called in Justice Groez
inger's court yesterday Lynch, who ap
peared under protest, was placed on the
stand by George Perry, who represents J.
J. Kauer, to whom Jimmy Carroll's claim
has been assigned.
He was asked particularly about the
checK, in which he denied having the
slightest interest, and wiien pressed to
tell where it now is, said that a man
named Dowdelle, whom he described as
being from Montana, had it.
"How did he get it V" asked Perry.
"Mr. Sharkey told me to give it to him,"
said Lynch.
"Do you know what Mr. Dowdelle did
with it?" asked Perry.
"I do not," was the answer.
â¢'Do you mean to say that you gave up
so valuable a i>iece of paper without find
ing out what was done with it?" queried
Perry.
"That's right," said Lynch. "I sup
pose he put it in some safe deposit."
"But you do not know what one?"
"No, sir, 1 do not."
Lynch further said that the check was
entirely Sharkey's property, and that as
far as he knew the "Sailor" was not in
debted to the Montana man.
After J. J. Groom had been placed on
the stand to testify that thÂ« club had no
further interest in the check, the hearing
was adjourned to next Tuesday.
Then the Justice, the attorneys and the
reporters adjourned to Sharuey's room at
the Windsor. The sailor had been sub
penaed, but had remained in bed on the
plea that his injuries would not permit of
his going out.
Lynch had evidently not anticipated
such a move, for he bad failed to post
Sharkey, and the sailor was all at sea
when questionct.
Asked about Dowdelle he said thatjhe
thought he had heard of him.
'â¢Did you authorize Mr. Lynch to give
him the $10,000 certificate of deposit?"
asked Perry.
"I did not," was the answer. "Lyncii
has the certificate now."
He also stated that he had not seen it
during the day, which was a fiat contra
diction of Lynch's statement thatSbarkey
had held the check earlier in the day.
So it seems that Sharkey says Lynch
has the chock and Lynch sÂ»ys Dowdelle
has the check locke.l up somewhere and
no one seems to be able to cet track of it.
Unless Wyatt Earp appears in court on
Tuesday next when his name is called he
will be arrested for contempt of court.

THOUSANDS
DAZZLED.
Sixth Street Had a Great
Time With Its New
Illumination.
ARC LIGHTS RIVALED
THE DAYLIGHT.
Dense Crowds Frequented the
Thoroughfare All Last
Evening.
MYEI&D3 OF LANTERNS HUNG
ALOFT.
Decorations Were Pleas ng and the
Comments of Spectators Were
Favorable.
The electric illumination of Sixth street
last evening was duly celebrated.
iThe lichts, which are suspended over
tbe middle pf the street for a distance of
three blocks, between Murket and Folsorn
streets, were turned on soon after dark,
and ai once the thoroughfare was as
bright as day.
Soon after, the crowd which swarmed
on the sidewalks and even invaded the
street, in the reueral desire to see what
was going on, numbered thousands. I
There were probably 20,000 persons at least I
who, during the evenine, went over the
illuminated portions of Sixth street. The
general opinion was that Sixth street had
the biggest gathering in its history.
The general spectacle was fully a3 bril
liant ns had been anticipates. The illu
mination supplied by the arc lights was
supplemented by two strings of Japanese
lanterns, which were suspended on either
side of the street from Mnrket to Folsoro,
and also by thousands of other lanterns,
which were hung from the curbs in strings
and festoons over tbe sidewalks, being
attached to the store irunts.
The display of bunting was quite gen
eral. There was quite an nrray of flags
hung over the middle of the street. M:ir.y
merchants decorated their stores, and
there were very few stores at which there
were no decorations.
To call attention to tbe demonstration
a decorated cart was drawn to and fro
over tbe adjoining part* of the City, a
band playing, this being accompanied by
another wagon on which red fire was
burned.
Throughout the entire evening rockets
were discharged from various places on
Sixth street, and a crowd gathered on
Market street and added to the previously
(.r.'at number who helped to make the
occasion all that the projectors had
wished.
Boys were in their glory from Folsom to
Market streets, enjoying a regular Fourth
of July celebration, in which giant lire
crackers and redheads figured. In addi
tion to the combined effort of the mer
chants to send up pyrotechnics individual
business houses did something in the
same line. Stores were well patronized
and the dealers in various kinds of goods
did a "laud-ofnce business" and were cor
respondingly happy.
The glare of the electric lights brought
into strong relief the cobbled pavement
which extended over a part of the illu
minated area. It alao caused the antique
"bob" cars, drawn by one horse, to be seen
of all men and to be unmercifully joshed
as they slowly plodded along between the
dense crowd which lined either side of the
street.
All the corners were crowde I by specta
tors for a long period, the general appear
ance thereby being suggested of Market
street corners upon the day of a great
parade. Oh all sides exclamations of ap
proval were heard. Ie became known
that the Sixth-street Improvement Club
had already arranged to meet at once to
advocate a better pavement, and also to
briny; pressure to bear to have the back
numcer "bob" car line succeeded by some
thing more .-nodern and in better accord
ance with the progressive spirit of the
time and locality. Wilh these improve
ments added to the fine lighting already
provided, Sixth street will have taken a
very lone -'â tcp forward.
The illumination and the demonstration
accompanying it beins a joint enterprise
and paid for by all the merchants, all who
were concerned are entitled to an equal
and large shar^ of credit. The Sixth
street Improvement Ciub took the lead,
and nas brought about the lighting of the
thoroughfare, and will lead the other en
terprises to be put on foot. The commi'
tees who had charge of the illumination
were as follows:

from which he died soon after, and En

HEARST'S AIRY CHAMELEON,
In the New York Journal
It Is a Bona Fide Fly
ing Machine,
IN THE SAN FRANCISCO
EXAMINER A FAKE.
Illustrations of the Sacramento
Street Scene Were Sent
From This City.
AN OSTRICH-LIKE ATTEMPT TO
DELUDE THE PEOPLE.
Conflicting Stories Printed by the Siamese-Twin
Faker Show the Unreliability of the
Two Shameless Papers.
A further study of the New York Morn
ing Journal's page indorsement of the San
Francisco airship siory confirms the
opinion that it was written in the Ex
aminer office of this City.
The illustrations of the street scene here
during the passage of the aerial visitant
appear to have been drawn in the Ex
aminer office here.
The Call to-day reproduces in a dimin
utive form the picture that the Journal
printed across an entire page, being a
street scene in Sacramento during the
night when some bright object passed
over the City, attracting the attention of
all who had eyes.
The incident illustrates as plainly as did
tbe two views Mr. Hearst held on the gold
question how the young millionaire toys
with the truth and fakes here and there to
cater to the strange mob that reads his
papers.
Another illustration of the absolute un
reliability of the Examinerâ and like in
stances appears In the Journal â is seen
in yesterday's issue. Great space is given
to the account ot a supposed airship that
was discovered in a gully near Twin Peaks
a few nights ajo. The Examiner's mis
leading description and great illustration
might lead the reader to believe a boca
h'dd airship had been found, whereas the
most cursory examination shows that the
tin rattle-trap discovered was a clumsy
fake, probably projected by some adver
tising man who will seek to exhibit it
later.
A little more detailed study of the arti
cle that appeared in the Journal of No
vember 28 shows how fully the paper gave
credence to the story which the Examiner
here ridiculed becnuse The Call had the
news iirst. Among other things, after
quoting a number of people, the Journal
said:
"Hundreds of similar interviews could
be obtained. Many practical electricians
saw the strange sight. All of them main
tain .that the searchlight was electrical in
character. They say, too, that to produce
a light of such power and brilliancy would
require at least one horsepower, and that
would mean a vessel capable of sustaining
half a ton weight for the light alone. One
thing all the witnesses of the phenomenon
are positive of; that is that the search
light was white, like that shed by an arc
lamp.
"The inventor of the successful airship is
Dr. E. H. Benjamin of San Francisco. It
is, however, suspected that this is an
assumed name to conceal the inventor's
real identity. His attorney is C. W. Col
lins, a prominent lawyer with offices at
rooms 21 and 22 Crocker building, San
Francisco."
Describing the appearance of the phe
nomenon seen in Sacramento, the Journal
saiil :
â¢'On the evening of Tuesday, November
17. many citizens of Sacramento, Cali
fornia, were surprised by the sudden ap
pearance, directly over the city, of a
startling aerial craft. The peculiar night
visitant made its appearance about 7
o'clock. People standing on the side
walks saw coming through the sky, over
the housetops, a huge and brilliant light,
propelled swiftly by some mysterious
force. So brilliant was the light that as
it flashed past suburban residences the
inmates went to their doors expecting
to find a neighboring house in flames.
5 eSrice FIVE CENTS.
Instead they saw a wonderful craft of the
SKY."
Throughout the Journal article the
affirmation is made that what was seen
was some craft in the sky, while every line
that appeared in the Examiner pooh
poohed the idea. Tbe articles side by side
show how unreliable the Examiner is in
its handling of local news. Its real views
appear in the Journal's account of the air
ship, while every line in the Examiner
was written from the spirit of envy be
cause it "was originally beaten in the- news.
As later evidence of the puerile, fan
tastic double-dealing of the Examiner of
this City may be adduced the contradic
tory attitude of its local and editorial
treatment of the "fake showmen's" air
ship, exposed in The Call. In the local
Columns this is treated as a solemn, in
controvertible fact, to be viewed by visitors
to Twin Peaks. Turning over the page,
an editorial says:
Two men in this City, apparently trying to
turn the craze to financial account in the dime
museum line, hare just taKen the trouble to
build a forty-foot galvanized-iron 'airship,"
and' roll it down a hill, with the chance ot flat
tening themselves under It.
Again, in the face of the straight news
giving of The Call, and the warm cham
pionship of the airship by his New York
Journal, Mr. Hearst in the Examiner of
yesterday says, editorially:
"Fake journalism" has a good deal to anawer
for, but we do not recall a more discreditable
exploit In that line than the persistent at
tempt to make tne public believe that the air
in this vicinity is populated with airships. It
has been mauifest for weeks that the whole
airship story is a pure myth.
Shears and paste are cheap, and the
Examiner, in its disgruntled envy caused
by being outclassed in giving the news,
might try to redeem itself by extracting
some airship news from the columns of
its Eastern supplement, the New York
Journal.

TWO GUNBOATS
ARE LAUNCHED
The Vicksburg and New
port Glide Down the
Ways at Bath.
Vast Crowds Welcome the New
Additions to the Modern
Navy.
Both Vessels Christened by Young
Ladies Under Most Historic
Circumstances-
BATH, Mi, Dec. s.â United States gun
boats Vicksburg and Newport were
launched at 12:40 and 12:55 P. M. re
spectively.
Ten thousand people witnessed the twin
launching at the Bath Iron Works to-day.
Mi-s Addie Trowbridge of Vicksburg
broke the ribbon-covered champagne bot
tle on tne stern of the vessel of tnat name,
saying, "I christen thee Vicksburg, and
may your history be as memorable as tuat
â¢of your namesake."
Miss La Farge of Newport, granddaugh
ter of Commodore Perry, broke the cham
pagne bottle and christened the boat
Newport.
The gunboats are of what is known as
composite construction, the entire frame
of steel, and above the water each is
plated with steel and planked below. The
jilankine is covered with copper, the ad
vantage of this over t:;e steel being that
the vessel will not need docking for years
and may make uninterrupted cruises of
seven or eight years. Each boat has three
lull decks, running the entire length of
the vessel.
The length over all is 200 feet and 168
feet between perpendiculars. The beam
between moldings is 35 feet 5 inches and
extreme beam 3(J feet. The mean draught
is 12 feet and the displacement 1000 tons.
As compared with the Machias and Cas
tine these new boats are twenty-two feet
shorter, four feet wider and of the same
displacement. The rigisthatof a barken
thw, and the area of the nine principal
tails will be 11,500 feet.
The armament consists of six 4-inch
rapid-fire breech-loading rifle 3, four
6-pound rapid-fire guns and two 1-pound
ers. The boilers are of the Scotch type,
two iv number, with a working pressure
of 160 pounds.
The engine is of the vertical triple ex
pansion type, with cylinders 16 inches, 22
inches and 36 inches in diameter, respec
tively, and with a 24-inch stroke. Its
horsepower is 800, half that of the Machias.
The contract speed is twelve knots, with
no premium for excess, but with penalty
for falling short, but they will be accepted
if they make eleven knots.
The coal capacity is 300 tons, giving a
steaming radius of 11,000 knots. But as
the boats are designed to cruise under sail
ordinarily they will not have to recoal in
skta oi a year. The total cost will be
$460,000. The boats will be ready for sea
early next year. Each will carry nine offi
cers, ten marines and 125 bluejackets.
Tbeir rig will be very heavy and the boats
will be very heavy under sail. In appear
ance they are much like steam yachts of
approved model.

Brought by Budge et al. Against
the Union Pacific.
BOSTON. Mass,, Dec. s.â The action at
law brought by Henry Budge, Charles A.
Peabody and Henry de Coppel, of New
York, vs. the Union Pacific Railroad Com
1 any, and the bill in equity brought by
the Union Pacific Railroad Company vs.
Budge, Peabody and De Coppel, were
heard in the United States Circuit Court
to-day by Judge Aldrich upon preliminary
motions filed by the parties.
/ The action at law is brought by Budge
et al., who are a committee of the bond
holders of the Uniou Pacific Railroad
Company, whose bonds were secured by
an equal amount of bonds of the Denver,
Leadville and Gunmson Railroad Com
pany as collateral. They seek to recover
of the defendant Union Pacific Railroad
$3,000,000 damages.
They rely upon a deficiency in the price
reaiz-d from a sale of the collateral at
New York in October, 1894, which amount
was only $25 000 as compared with the
amount of ttie Union Pacific bonds which
they held, amounting in face value to
$2,484,000, and with the overdue interest
to something more.
The suit in equity brought by the Union
Pacific against Budge et al. seeks to set
aside the foreclosure sale of the Denver,
Lfatlville and Gunnison Railroad Com
pany bonds, which were neld as collateral,
claiming that the foreclosure was invalid
because the Union Pacific was in the hands
of receivers, and the foreclosure was with
out lÂ°ave of court, was without notice and
was not in good faith, and was fraudu
lent.
The suit was brought upon a motion by
defendants, the Union Pacific, asking that
the trial, which had been fixed for n ext
January, be delayed until the plaintiffs,
who are the defendants in tho equity case
brought by the Union Pacific, shall ap
pear in that bill.
The equity case was brought up on the
motion which the defendants' counsel
filed tinder a special appearance, claiming
that the court had no jurisdiction, prin
cipally because the grounds upon which it
waÃ based were the same as tnose which
taÂ° railroad relied up n ana sot up in de
fense of the action at law.
The motions raise novel and imnortant
questions of practice, and the court re
serves them for further consideration.
OPPOSITION TO THE GARNEGIES.
The Standard Orl Company and the Rocke-
fellers Go Into the Iron and
Steel Business.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec s.â The actual
purchasers reoently of a large tract of
Jand in the Caiumet River region of South
Chicago and the ultimate purpose to
the property will be put leaked out
to-day.
The Standard Oil Company and the
Rockefellers bought $130,000 worth of real
estate from the Calumet Canal and Dock
Company, embracing 3600 feet of docKsge
along Lake Michigan, the Caiumet River
and slip at the mouth of the river. Upon
this land the Rockefeller interests will
buiid :he largest steel plant in the country,
including blast furnaces, steel rail mills
and roilja for the manufacture of struc
tural iron.
Tlie total cost of the plant will be
$10,1)00,000. This new enterprise will
bring the Standard Oil Company into di
rect competition with' the Carnegies. The
Rockefellers already own great ranges of
iron mines in the Lake Superior region
and a fleet of steel steamers which will
carry the ore to the Calumet River. This
fleet is to be increased next season. Build
ing operations are to commence early next
year.

' nplnhirij.
BTANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec.
5.â N. A. Carle '98, the big Stanford right
guard, is out as a candidate for the cap
taincy of the Stanford football eleven.
Cotton was first in the field and it
looked ior a time as tnougn he had no
competitors, but the Mends of Carle have
urged his name so persistently of late
that there is no longer any doubt that he
is in the race.
He has played two years on the Varsity
eleven with increased ability each season,
and his game on Thanksgiving proved
him one of Stanford's strongest players.
Cotton has played three years on the Var
sity, and is regarded as tne best ali-round
player on the team. The contest between
the men is most friendly, and both are ac
knowledged by tbe students to be good
men and unusually brilliant players.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
ANNUAL REPORT
OF SEC. HERBERT
Reviews the Progress of
the Building Up of the
New Navy.
Light-Draught Vessels Needed
for Entry of Ports Along
the Rivers.
Comparisons in Tonnage to Show This
Country Is Not Yet Able to
Cope With Powers.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. s.âSecre
tary of the- Navy Herbert in his annual
report asks Congress at the coming session
to authorize three light-draught battle
ships and twelve torpedo-boats. He recom
mends that these ships be planned for an
extreme deep-load draught of not more
than twenty-three feet and suggests that
considerations of strategy upon our At
lantic and Gulf coasts render this an es-
ential to the success of the naval cam-
MigttS.
"This reasoning," he says, "is the final
esult of much careful study by able offi-
cers of conditions as they exist on our
southern coast. Battle-ships that could
enter the harbors of Savannah, Bruns-
wick, Key West, Tampa, Pensacola, Mo
bile and the mouth of the Mississippi at
all times would have an immense advan
tage over the battle-ships oi foreign na
tions, few if any of which could enter
these Torts. Light-draught battle-ships,
if we had them, could make any of these
ports bases of supplies, could tally forth
frpm them or retire into them'at will and
could therefore most always offer battle
on their own terms. There are alsj many
of our ports furtuer north which would
give the same advantages to such ships."
An interesting feature of the report is a
resume of the progress of the upbuilding
of the new navy from the time of its in
auguration under Secretary Chandler.
Congress has authorized during the pres-
ent administration twenty-eight vesseiS
with a total tonnage of 65.8U6 tons. Of
these five are first-class battle-ships and
sixteen torpedo-boats.
"Large as the above increase appears,"
says the Secretary, "it is not sufficient to
place the United States navy in a satis
factory condition. We mean to be able at
all times to defend our long line of sea
coast, afford unquestionable protection to
our citizens in loreign iand?, render ef
ficient aid to our diplomacy and maintain
under all circumstauce9 our Nattoual
honor."
The Secretary, calling attention to the
comparative naval strength of the prin
cipal powers, states thai while the results
achieved by the United States are highly
creditable to the country, yet it is clear
that the great powers with which we are
brought into close relationship largely
exceed us not only in the number of battle
ships and torpedo-boats actually in com
mission but in their naval programmes
for the future. The Secretary shows that
on June 3J, 1893, there were thirty vessels
in commission, with a tonnage of 62,820
tons, while on December 10 the total ton
nage in commission will be 137,859 tons,
Attention is again called to toe necessity
for some legislation by Congress which
will enable the department to make use
in case of an emergency of the tugs,
yachts and vessels engaged in the fishing
fleets and coastwise and lake trade and to
call into the service of the navy the suilora
and officers necessary to command and tit
such ships in ca=e of threatened or actual
waiu He recommends an additional ap
propriation for the purpose of supplying
guns and ammunition with which to arm
vessels to be called into service from our
merchant marine.
Reference is also made to a reserve sys
tem, and the Secretary sets forth the
report of a board appointed to formulate a
general plan for the laying up of vessels in
reserve, and in this connection it is
announced that the department expects to
be able to submit to Congress at an early
day during the comiug session suggestions
for such legislation as may be needed to
enable it to provide proper accommoda
tions for ships, so tnat it may establish
and maintain a reserve system with the
value and importance of which the depart
ment is deeply impressed.
The 'subject of the naval militia is dealt
with at some length, and it is shown that
at the close of the last year the number of
naval military lawfully certified was 1794,
divided among the States of Rhode Island,
Maryland, South Carolina, North Carolina,
Massachusetts, California and New York.
From the last official returns they number
3339 from the States of New York, Califor
nia, Rhode Island, Maryland, South Caro
lina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Illi
nois, Connecticut, Michigan, New Jersey,
Georgia and Louisiana, and the depart
ment has been informed of che prospective
formation of an additional battalion in
New York (at Brooklyn) and an organiza
tion in Ohio.
During tne summer the various battal
ions have been drilled in vessels of the
navy and have had the advantage of tar
get practice and drills with the batteries
of the ships. The Secretary devotes con
siderable space to reviewing the reports
of the chiefs of bureaus which have al
ready been published, and in this connec
tion ask 3 Congress to authorize the build
ing of a dock at Norfolk of suflicient size
to take in the largest vessel of the navy.
This he recommends should be constructed
of concrete, as it is more readily repaired
and cheaper than a wooden dock.
Such satisfactory experiments have
been made with liquid fuel by Engineer
in-Chief Melville that the department has
ordered that a tug now being constructed
at the Norfolk yards and one of the
smaller torpedo-boats being built by the
Herreschoff Company be fitted for using
this oil, intending thus to thoroughly test
its capabilities. These boats will be
adapted for coal if oil fails.
For the relief of the overworked Eigi
neer Corps it is urged that their number
be increased until the limit shall reach
250 instead of 194, as at present.
It is announced that a training station
on the Pacific Coast, on the island of
Yerba Buena. as provided for by Congress,
will soon be established, and that in the
meantime th* Adams, now returning from
Honolulu, will be fitted for the duty.
CLETELAND WILL BE THERE.
Elaborate Preparation* fnr the Jackson
liirlhday littnqart
CHICAGO, 111., Dec 5. â The local
leaders of the National Democratic party
are counting on the presence of President
Cleveland at the Jackson birthday oan
quet, which is to take pl&ce here Janu
ary 8.
A formal letter of invitation has Deen
written by Chairman Goodrich of the
committee of arrangements, and the least
that is expected in return is a political
letter to be read at the banquet. Ex-
Mayor Hopkins, who recently saw the
President, brought assurances that the
President's acceptance was not an im
probability.
Others to be invited, who will no doubt
be here, are: Senator Vilaa and General
Bragg of Wisconsin, John P. Irish of
California, HÂ»nry Watterson, J. M. Outh
wai.e of Ohio, Secretary ox Slate
Olney, E. \V. Lehman of Missouri.
Tnomas Gargan of Massachusetts, ex-Sec

GOES BY THE GAS ROUTE.
Suicide of a Hotel Porter Who Knew
Every Politician in This Countryâ The
Defeat of Blame Broke His Heart.
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. s.â Albert F.
Lovejoy, who was for many years a porter
at the Filth-avenue Hotel, committed sui
cide during the night at his room in the
Putnam House by inhaling gas.
He was found dead this morning. He
had made certain of death by stuffing
with paper the keyhole and seams of the
door in bis room and also fastening the
window tightly.
Lovejoy had a peculiar history. During
the quarter of a century be was in service
at the Fifth-avenue Hotel he met almost
every prominent politician in the country.
He was a special friend of Blame. Grant
and Garfield. Whenever Grant stopped
at the hotel Lovejoy was detailed as his
valet and ho was relieved of all other
duties.
The failure of Blame's election in 1884
broke L.ivejoy's heart and he took to
drink. He continued his spree until a
couple of years ago, when he was dis
missed from the hotel.
Since then he has done nothing in par
ticular. Lovejoy, while head porter of the
Fifth-avenue Hotel, became a mine of po
litical information, and was as wel posted
as any one on the political affairs of the
Nation. There was not a prominent po
liiical frequenter of the hotel whom he
did not know and with whom he did not
have a personal acquaintance.
His position at the hotel was a lucrative
one and he saved considerable money, but
got rid of it speedily when he began his
dissipation. Lovejoy had no relatives so
far as known, but there is little doubt
that his old-time friends will take charge
of the remains and give them fitting
burial.
MEXICAN RAILROAD POOL.

prospect of the flood leaving the city en

no great destruction of property.
Business men who were compelled to re -
move their goods are not taking any risk
by moving back into the abandoned build

pected to resume much of its normal con

BISHOP BONACUM
YET SHOWS FIGHT
Will Not Abide by the
Decision of the Metro
politan Court.
Determined to Appeal His Cele
brated Case to th 3 Apos
tolic Delegate.
In a Letter He Heaps Abuse Upon
His Judges and the Priests Who
Vanquished Him
LINCOLN. Nbbr., Dec. 4. â Bishop
Bonacum to-day gave to the press the
following letter, being his side of the now
famous fight between the Bishop and the
priests in this diocese, and bearing more
directly on the recent trial at Dubuque, in
which the Bishop was defeated:
Lincoln, Nebr., Dec. 5, 1896
Rev. Father Fancy, Hector of the Auburn Mv-
Bionâ Reverend and Hear Sir: I have been
absent from home administering contirma
tions in the southwestern part of the State,
and the circumstances will explain why I
have not written to you sooner.
In order that you and your people may not
be deceived by the telegraph dispatches which
are btung sent out from Dubuque in reference
to the case of the diocese oi Dubuque vs. Rev.
Dennis Fitz;erald, 1 will state that the dis
patches in question have been written or in
spired by two persons who are known to us all
us men of unblushing mendacity and who, in
collusion with two others, have for the past
three "bi- four years made use of the press agen
cies and two or three disreputable newspapers
to create a public opinion agalust me through
out the country.
It is known to you, reverend and dear sir,
that with two or three exceptions I have never
noticed these slanderous attacks, for I do not
recognize the public as the tribunal to which
I am amenable ior my official conduct.
Neither have I had at any time a desire or in
clination to engage In nowspapar controversy
with abandoned men.
As to proceedings in the Metropolitan Curia
at Dubuque, I have to say that they are null
find void (ab initio), and, therelore. that the
sentence of which the dispatches speak is of no
force and is not to be regarded by you. The
miscarriage of the case is to be ascribed solely
to the unfortunate selection of the judge who
was delegated by the Most Reverend Metro
politan to hear the case. For grave and
weighty reasons and in accordance with a
practice which obtains in some Metropolitan
courts his Grace of Dubuque deemed it for the
best in this to take no part in tne proceedings,
and he accordingly left the adjudication of the
case to a certain Rev. P. A. Baart of Michigan.
It ts proper to state here that this clergyman
wag wholly unknown to the Most Reverend
Archbishop and that his Grace selected him
solely on the recommendation of another per
son. As the aforesaid Baart was not above sus
picion on account of his strained relations
with his own ordinary and ior other reasons,
the Rev. Thomas Eagan of Milwaukee, procu
rator for the diocese of Lincoln, challenged
him peremptorily; but, strange to say. con
trary to all ecclesiastical law and usage, the Rev.
Mr. Baart refused to withdraw from the case.
He even declined to receive and place on file
the formal challenge which had beeu made
against him, but with indescribable non
chalance he put the document in his pocket.
Kay, he went so far as to ins'ruct the notary
not to enter the procurator's exceptions on the
SYMPTOMS.

record. Under the circumstances nothing was
left for the diocese- of Lincoln to do but to
protest against such arbitrary conduct and to
withdraw. This was done and we left the
court.
The case now goes on appeal to the apostolic
.delegation at Wnshington, ana I will advise
you of the outcome. I am, reverend and dear
â ir, your devoted servant in the Lord,
Thomas Bonacvm, Bishop of Lincoln.
P. S.â As 1 nnish writing the above an official
copy of the decision is handed to me. It is in
deed a very strange document and replete
â¢â¢vitli the grossest calumnies against me. In it
Rev. Mr. Baart descends from tbe exalted posi
tion of a judge to the level of the blackguard,
and becomes the special pleader for a brace of
clerical adventurers who have invariably
given trouble to the Bishops and people of the
various diocese in which they have been. I
shall have occasion in the future to animad
vert more at length on this extraordinary pro
duction. ______ââ â â .

;" ; : '. .BERLIN, Gep.maxv, Dec. s.â Woon the
itT-ial: of the rive editors, Baron yon
.; Luetzow and Herren Ploetz, Foellmar,
â  Leckert and Berber for libeling Baron
Marshall yon Bieberstein, Minister of
X Foreign- Affairs, Prince Alexander yon
tlohehbole and Count August Eulenburg
was adjourned yesterday, the prevalent
opinion was that disclosures of even
more importance than those developed in
the course of the proceedings were im
pending. The case is really a duel be
tween the secret police and the Foreign
Office^ in the progress of which Baron yon
i .Uebersteiii obviously feels that he is on
4 ;al himself and needs exculpation from
*:he suspicion of having unduly influenced
the Emperor's decision and carried on in
tricues against other Ministers.
When the Minister of Foreign Affairs
accused Baron yon Tausch, the chief of
.tbe political police, of having inspired ar
ticles in the press against him and at the
same time admitted that tlie Foreign Of
lice employed newspaper men to supply
. ii with information in regard to the writ
ing, of articles and other ways, he incurred
.â  the implication contained in the" response
â ;â¢â  hrade by Baron yon Tausch that the po
;:â  lit iqal. "police did nothing different from
.. *^sv-li;rt was done by the Foreign Oirlce. "If
ironorable for the Foreign OlJice so to
â  ; . wprk," he said, "the policial police claim
â '; that their method is equally honorable."
.â¢}:, Trie whole affair is leaving the very
. 'â¢ â¢ w;orst'impression upon the country regard
; .-.'ins the relations of the official bureau and
â  tb.e^ so-called inspired newspapers. The
â¢â¢; mere mention, to say nothing of the fact
. .-'.as shown by tbe confession of Baron yon
Livet-zow, that a police agent on a begeariy
salary bi $50 a month could be employed
to forge calumnies in behalf of the chiefs
of the political police, attacking the heads
oft he Government and even endangering
international relations, has utterly shocked
ihe" public. Nor is it surprising that
.Baron vo:i Luetzow should have rounded
"tfp; on Chief Tauten. Realizing that the
'."sgVna'e is up he naturally shifts the responsi
\tiilit-y''upon the shoulders of his employer.
.liiron Marschall yon Bieberstein, how
> ever, seems very likely to come first-best
â¢oat. of the proceedings, though the ma
â¢... clifrua't'ions of tho defendants and their
â¢ : -iilHj3s:'are'so complicated that it is impos
'' 'svble to predict the issues of the case with
'- <my degree of certainty. As the public
. utor intimated yesterday, it is prob
' abitfthat Baron yon Tausch will be accused
a.s" accessory to Luetzow's forgeries, yet
Baron' 'Marschall yon Biebjrstein cannot
r' escape criticism. The bard iact remains
tnat.ectnal antagonism between certain
i^Jmistcrs within the Cabinet and the
â¢ Ahje'fs of .the Emperor's Cabinet not only
â¢i existed but still continues.
;â¢ /Tiie explanation of the Minister of
â¢j\ Foreign Affairs that articles appearing in
"- "t'U.e Cologne Gazette, the Hamburg Corre
:< F^Q'ndenz and other so-called semi-official
!' -journals were rarely inspired by the For
â¢V,eiÂ£n Office did not clarify the question
â¢"/:>^hly these journals persistent^' attacked
â .'â¢ t"hÂ£ chiefs of the Emperor's Cabinet.
' : [{ .;.."T.iie Nt^^te Machrichten says: "It is not
â¢: â  .w)Vbout considerable astonishment that
" . â¢. toy, pifb'.ic watches the great machinery
- â â¢â 'set. ill motion hy the Foreign Office over
.tfiesetwo despicable intriguers, while the
, .';â¢ rn'uch more serious accusations against
.. -Baron Marschall yon Bieber^tein {and
â¢â¢. tttjrers published in the Klatteradatsch
â  :. ye'a'rsf. ago were deliberately ignored, and
: tliei-r ' authors, instead of being arraigned
ii.h'Hhe courts, where they were eager to
Appear, were challenged to -fight duels.
â¢ An.other reproach is levied against Baron
'M-axschmll yon Bieberstein in the reason
Whith' "he has given why Tausch and
Luptzow are only now exposed. Someof
th'cir intrigues long ago affected General
Brcmsart yon Schellendorf, late Minister
of-^V'ar; Herr yon Koeiler, formerly Min
ister ,of tne Interior, and Count yon
Eulenburg, yet he kept silent.
. at he says: 'When Tausch had the
insolence to circulate calumnies about me
and 'the Foreign Office officials I decided
upon making the matter public' The
pebple are asking what the Emperor
thinks about it all."

of gold from the United States is less as

in New York as compared with the rates

tae statement published yesterday morn
"inp.by the Daily Isews, to fie effect that
the. six great powers would shortly con
sider a project, the object of whicl; is the
'occupation by Russia of ihe northeastern
*prner of Turkey, formed by the ;; Bos"
ruorus and the Black Sea,, to a bout half-?
way down the Bosphorus, which, to
gether with the Dardanelles, will be made
entirely free to tbe vessels of all nations.
The Daily News added that the forts along
tho Dardanelles wtfuld be dismantled and
Abdul Hamid would retire from the
Sultanate.
In official quarters here it is declared
that the alleged project is an absurd
fantasm. The Foreign Office has heard of
no such proposal, and oificials there say
it is impossible to understand why a re
sponsible paper would publish such a
statement. The truth is that there is
still complete pause in the discussion of
the question affecting the Dardanelles.
When the matter is reopened Lord Salis
bury will not admit of any change in his
intention that whatever rights in the
straits have been obtained by Russia must
be extended to all the powers.

COL. O NEL MAPLRNON SURPRISED.
Could Xnt Understand Why Backers
Kicked Orer Â«* "Trifle."
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. sâ There
were probably more people to whom the
news of the breaking up of Colonel Maple
son's new Imperial Opera Company in
Boston was a cause of regret than to
whom it svas a cause of surprise. It was
generally expected by the time the com
pany was fairly started on its engage
ment here that it would not be a financial
success. It was rumored, indeed, that the
company would not leave New York, but
It went to Phildelphia and then to Boston,
and there it has closed its cureer unless
the resourceful Colonel succeeds in patch
ing things together so as to take ths
sineers, or some of them, to Mexico.
When the plans of the new Imperial
Opera Company were lirst promulgated
it was announced that a new opera-house
was to be built lor it in London, on the
site of tbe old Her Majesty's Theater,
Haymarket. That part of the scheme
was the first to be given up, and now that
spot is to be occupied by a hotel and a
theater, the latter to be called again Her
Majesty's Theater, and to be occupied by
Beerbohm Tree.
The first plan was for the opera com
pany to have a season each year in Lou
don and a season in America and as the
theater was not to be ready so soon as the
comnany, it was arranged that the start
should be made in America. When it
proved that the opera-house never was to
be ready, the American season became
the chief object. The financial backing
was vested in an English corporation of
supposedly untold wealth. Colonel Maple
son is quoted as expressing surprise that
the company got tired of a little thine like
the loss of from $12,000 to ?l."),000 a week.
The remark is characteristic of the
Colonel. Â«

Another Examination of th* Baltimore
and Ohio's Aeeounti to lie Blade..
BALTIMORE, Md., Dec. s.â The Bal
timore reorganization committee of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company is
not satisfied with the report of Stephen
W. Little on the financial condition of the
property between the dates of September
30, 1888, and November 30, 1890, the period
of the Mayer management, and will profc
ably make an Independent examination of
the books and accounts of the corporation
on lines entireiv different from those fol
low*d by Mr. Little in his investigation
for the New York reorganization commit
tee.
The fcatnro of Mr. Little's report that
has attracted most attention is that which
deals with the floating debt of the corpora
tion. This was stated in the annual re
ports to be $4,000,000, but Mr. Little found
it to be over $16,000,000. The Baltimore
committee will nave a meeting next week
and decide upon what action, if any, is to
ba taken.
May Abandon the Jtarrnrkn.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 5.-By order of
Major-General Merritt a rigid inspection
of Jefferson Barracks and the rifle rango
at Arcadia, eight miles south, is to De
begun on the lGth inst. For thi3 duty
Colonel Guy V. Henry, Colonel Albert
Uartouff and Major J. B. Giranl, the two
latter of the medical staff, are detailed.
Upon their report the fate oi the barracks
as a military post depends. It is asserted
that the prevalence o! malarial fever has
made the further maintenance of the post
undesirable. It is pointed out by the bar
racks officers, however, that the hospital
and its attachments, which v-'ere con
structed in 18.54, have not since been
changed and are necessarily unsanitary.
The abandonment of the barracks except
as a recruiting station will follow an ad
verse report.
Vinpoti'.ion of Indian Znnda
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. s.â lndian Agent
D. M. Wisdom, stationed at Muscogee,
Ind. T., passed here to-day going to
Washington, where he will confer with
Secretary Francis upon the disposition of
Indian lands. "One of the plans pro
posed," said he, "is that the Indians of
the five civilized tribes sell the land to the
federal Government, and to receive $400
apiece for it. The entire Territory would
then bo opened for settJement. This
schema would seriously affeci a score of
townsites and prosperous villages now es
tablished, but meets with much favor.
Other members of the five tribes prefer to
have the land allotted so that each may
do ior himselfâ live on the land if he
chooses, or sell to the best advantage.".
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
WEST INDIES
SUGAR INDUSTRY
The Decay of the Colonial
May Be Used to Get
Protection.
An Agitation That Is Not at
All Relished in British
Ministerial Circles.
It May Cause an Alteration in the
Commercial Policies of the United
Kingdom.
LONDON, Eng., Dec. s.â The agitation
in favor of the West Indies sugar industry
has acquired large political interest in
England and bids fair to become an initi
ative toward a revival of protectionism.
In ministerial circles the agitation is
not at all relished. The Ministers know
that an increasing body of their support
ers are eager to seize the decay of the colo
nial sugar industry as leverage toward a
revival of protection generally. Lord
Salisbury, while the last Conservative
Government was in power, determined in
favor of what was termed "reciprocity,"
or some system that would check the de
structive interference of bounties upon
the colonial produce.
It will be recalled that the London con
fprence, presided over by Baron Henry de
Worms, now Lord Pirbright, discussed this
question of reciprocity, and after long sit
tings arrived at no conclusion giving a
remote indication of how to balance con
flicting interests. Now that the foreign
bounty system threatens the absolute ex
tinction of the colonial sugar trade, the
Conservatives want decisive legislative
action.
The predictions in English free trade
quarters that the European countries
would get tired of paying bounties to give
England cheap su?ar are proving false.
The fear now is that once the extinction
of British colonial products is accom
plished, the British consumer will find
himself in the Dower of Continental rings
which will raise prices at their will.
The situation has become so acute with
such far-reaching possibilities of an alter
ation in English commercial policy that
the representative of the United States
Associated Presses has felt it advisable to
interview some of the chief men con
cerned in the agitation. T. L. Ohlsen,
secretary of the West India committee,
stated that the chief consideration of a
Government commission would be reme
dial measures for the distress in the West
Indies, and connected therewith the
granting of imperial loans (administered
through the Jocal Governments on certain
conditions of interest, etc.) to planters
who improved their estates. The West
India committee was in constant consul
tation with the Government, urging it to
call a conference, and had reasonable
hopes that the influence of Mr. Chamber
lain would be exerted on their behalf.
Trie committee was also in communica
tion with prominent foreign politicians
and commercial bodies. Regarding the
question of the annexation of the British
West Indies to the United States he knew
that among; the planter* there was a strong
feeling that they would be better treated
if absorbed by the United States.
Touching this subject of annexation
Neville Lubbock, when interviewed, said
if the West Indies were to be ruined and
England was determined to continue her
cheap pugar, leaving the West Indies to
starvation, there was going to be much
rioting and bloodshed. The educated
masses, growers and others whose money
and interests were in the islands were
nearly all patriotic Englishmen.
But there was increasing feeling amongn g
them that in the event of the refusal of
England to assist, there was but one alter
nativeâthe annexation of the islands to
tho United States. They would prefer to
remain English, if they could, but not at
the cost of entire ruin.
The United States would not allow an
industry so valuable to the American peo
ple to be destroyed, and when the time
came for the West Indian colonies of
Great Britain to be taken over by the
United States, as the colonies seemed to
be worth nothing to England, she could
not offer to sell, but must give them to the
United States. W r est Indian sugar enter
ing the United States duty free would suit
the American people and restore the
finances of the islands to a flourishing con
dition within a few -.-pars.
SANIA IS RECEIPRESHIP
Surprising Answer tiled by the Attor-
neys of the lioati.
OSKALOOSA, Kan., Dec. s âThe Santa
Fe receivership case took a surprising turn
here to-day by the railroad attorneys
filing an answer in the case. The answer
filed to-day covers sixteen full typewriter's
pages, and certificates of the organization
of the new company and objection to the
proceedings of this court, and sets udâ
first, a general denial; second, it denies
that more than 20 per cent of the stock
was held by aliens at the time this suit
was brought; third, that the law was
never passed, and that if passed it was in
violation of the charter granted by the
State as well as a violation of the United
States constitution. The answer prays
that the case be dismissed and the com
panj r recover its losses herein.
Tne attorneys here think this action in
dicated that the attorneys for the road
have looked up the law and decided that
the court here has jurisdiction and that
Judge Taylor will so hold in his opinion
which will ba rendered at Topeka Mon
day. The filing of tnis answer is a de
cided surprise to the attorneys here after
the statement of the railroad's attorneys
that they would pay no attention to this
court, in view of which statement it was
expected that the case here would be
allowed to go by default.
To Indict Jeleyraph Offlelalt.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. s.â The Grand
Jury to-day voted to indict five officials of
the Western Union because tickets used in
cambling-houses belonged to the Western
Union Telegraph Company. State At
torney Kern and his assistant. Mr. Lynch,
both refused to draw up indictments, say
ing that no crime bad been committed
and that it wouid be just as reasonable to
indict a railro'id company because â  it
hauled goods that had been stolen. Judge
Hutchinson, to whom the Grand Jury ap
l.ealed, sustained the Slate Attorney and
advised the Grand Jury to reconsider its
action, which it promptly did.

MARK HANNA AT
THE WHITE HOUSE
Pleasant Meeting Between
the Republican Leader
and the President.
Amusing Incidents of the Late
Campaign Related by the
Visitors.
Obj ct of the Trip to Washington Is
to Make F nal Arrargments
for the Inaugural.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. s.â Mark
Hanna's presence in Washington to-day
did not give rise to a flood of Cabinet
speculation that ha:l been anticipated, for
the very satisfactory reason that he an
nounced early tnis morning that he was
here to perfect arrangements lor Mr. Mc-
Kinley's inauguration and not to cousult
with any one with respect to their Cabinet
preference. Neither would Mr. Hanna
throw any light on the report that he
himself would be a member of Mr. Mc-
McKinley's crficial household.
There is a well defined opinion among
those who have an intelligent understand
ing of the situation that whiie Mr. Hanna
could have any appointment under the
President-elect that he desires, he'wishes
to remain in private life and that will be
his ultimate decision. The Secretaryship
of the Treasury, to which popular report
has assigned him, will, it is thought, be
given to Congressman Dingley of Maine.
The only objection to his appointment is
the difficulty of finding a suitable suc
cessor for him in the chairmanship of the
Wuys and Means Committee.
Mr. Dingley has had so long and va
ried an experience in the House, and he
is so thoroughly familiar with the intrica
cies of the tariff that it is feared tiie party
would be a distinct loser by removing him
irom the arena in which he has been so
long a conspicuous figure.
It is this consideration and this only
that militates against his chances. There
are many, however, who assert that the
Treasury portfolio will be given to him
notwithstanding these objections, al
though it is confidently stated that up to
the present time no tender of a Cabinet
place has been made tc any one.
The uossip which connects Senator
Sherman's name with the State Depart
ment is thought to rest upon a reasonable
basis of probability, but it is denied that
Mr. Hanna's presence in Washington is
to confer with him respecting the matter.
It is regarded as more likely that Mr.
Hanna is more interested in learning the
views of public men upon questions of
policy than in selecting members of the
Cabinet.
Mr. Hanna to-day met President Cleve
land for the first time. He was intro
duced by General Horace Parter of New
York, the other gentlemen in the party
' being Senator Proctor of Vermont, Repre
sentative Babcock of Wisconsin and
Henry C. Payne, the National Committee
man from that State. Their stay did not
exceed fifteen minutes.
The time was consumed in an informal
chat, in whicti the President and his vis
itors related several amusing incidents of
the late campaign, but beyond this poli
tics were not discussed. The President
was in an agreeable frame of mind and
Mr. Hanna remarked, after leaving the
White House, upon the courtesy and affa
bility with which Mr. Cleveland had
greeted them.
JUeKISLEt'S PJUVATESECRETART.
Ferry Â«â¢ Heath Will Probably Be Se-
leeted for the Place.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 5.-It is
gossiped here among the friends of Perry
S. Heath that he aspires to be private
secretary to President-elect McKinley.
Mr. Heath's nome is at Muncie, Ind. For
fourteen years he was a Washington cor
respondent, and acquired a wide acquaint
ancs with public men. Mr. Heath was
for eight or nine years Washington corre
spondent of the Indianapolis Journal.
He might have been made private sec
retary to President Harrison, but did not
press his claims for that position, so
Elijah Halford, his former managing ed
itor, received the appointment. Mr. Heath
was an intimate friend of Major McKinley
â¢when the latter was a member of Con
gress, and when Heath became editor ana
proprietor of the Cincinnati Commercial
Gazette he immediately commenced to
boom his friend the major for the Presi
dency.
Heath was at the St. Louis Convention
in charge of the literary bureau at the
Southern Hotel, and he did his work so
â¢well that after McKinley's nomination he
was made chief of the bureau of literature
at the Chicago Republican campaign
headquarters. It it believed that McKin
ley has decided upon Mr. Heath for pri
vate secretary.
This pleases the old-time friends of the
ex-Washington correspondent, and all
along newstaner row is expressed the
hope that Mr. Heath may be highly hon
ored by the incoming administration.
Mr. Heath is now en route to Mexico, and
will return to Indiana by Christmas.
HOSVREIi til THE TETERAAS.
Grand Army Men Jirjoiee in the Eleva-
linn of Comratte McKinley .
CANTON, Ohio, Dec. s.â The President
elect had another active day. Congress
men were numerous and office-seekers
who came to make "social calls" were
more numerous. Representative Albert
J. Hopkins of the Eighth Illinois District
was an early caller and had a long talk
with Majoi McKinley.
Mr. Hopkins is chairman of the Ways
and Means Sub-committee on Recipro
city and it was of reciprocity legislation
he came to talk. He carried away the
impression that Major McKinley would
gladly support any suitable legislation de
sired to redeem the promise of the Repub
lican National platform on the subject of
reciprocity.
Representative George E. Fossof Illinois
was also a caller at the McKinley resi
dence to-day. He lunched with Major
McKinley, and joined him and Charles G.
Dawes in a short walk about the streets
of Canton at noon. Mr. Foss is a member
of the CommiMee on Naval Affairs, and
told the President-elect something of the
work the committee had in hand. The
local Grand Army post, of which Major
MrKinley is a member, has adopted these
resolutions:
"Whereas, Our esteemed comrade Major
William McKinley has been honored and
triumphantly elected to the highest office
in the gift of the people of the grandest
and most powerful republic thÂ« world has
ever seen; and, whereas, Lis election has
been accomplished by such an abso
lute majority of votes as to make
it an epoch in the history of
our nation, adding to his triumph a dis
tinction never before accorded to a Presi
dent-elect and thereby ;eflecting honor
and credit not only on him as a man and
a citizen, but on us as his comrades, and
on this post, in which he has always been
an honored comrade; therefore,
"Resolved, That we do most heartily
congratulate Comrade McKinley, not only
or, the unparalleled and brilliant cam
paign he conducted, but on his election to
the most exalted office he has been called
to fill.
"Resolved, That this memorial De pre
served on the records of this post and a
copy De sent to our distinguished com
rade."
NOE REPUBLICAN ELECTORS.
Attorney Wood S*'k* a Writ of Man
(tumus in South Dakota.
PIERRE, S. D., Dae. s.â At 8 o'clock
tonight Attorney Kichard Wood, one of
the Republican electors, appeared belore
the Supreme Court and asked for an al
ternutive writ of mandamus ordering that
certiticates of election be given to the
Republican electors on the vote as now
before the board, excluding the votes of
Lawrence and Butte counties, which give
the Populists about 700 majority and the
leaving out of which would give the Re
publican electors a majority.
The court refused to srant an alterna
tive writ, but granted an order to show
cauie why a peremptory writ should
not issue and set the answering of the
same for December 12. No action was
taken in regard to the count on Congress
men and it cannot be learned whether
any action will be taken or not.
Contests in Idaho.
POCATELLO, Idaho, Dec. s.â Contests
have been commenced against three Du
bois members of the Legislature in Bing
bam County, and the statement is made
that the four Dubois members-elect will
be contested in Bannock County and two
in Fremont County. The Pouulists are
behind the contests, the chief allegation
being that the candidates were on two
tickets. The seat of Frank A. Fenn, the
only McKinley supporter elected to the
Legislature, has also been contested.

CARSON, Nev., Dec. s.â The Secretary

PANIC AMONG PASSENGERS.
Frant c Attempts of a Demented Woman
to Commit Suicide in a Crowded
Railroad Car.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. s.â Mrs. Annie
Weinstein, a demented woman, who had
been an inmate of the poorhouse at Dun
ning and had left that institution after a
quarrel with employes, frightened a car
load of passengers into a panic this morn
ing on a St. Paul line train which was
coming into the city from Dunning.
She rushed across the aisle of the car,
grabbed a knife violently from the hand
of a man who was using it to peel an
apple and running to an end of the car
made a frantic attempt to kill herself.
She waved the weapon in the air,
uttering piercing screams at some
imaginary object and tried several times
to run the knife into her heart. Men
were afraid to go near her and women
scrambled out of the car. Two passengers
finally overpowered her. B.'ing more
composed when the train rpached Chicago
the woman was allowed to go her own
way.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
TURN MASSACRES
INTO "VICTORIES"
Treacherous Surprise of a
Cuban Hospital by
Spaniards.
Forty â¢ Five Helpless Inmates
Slaughtered by the Lying
Butchers.
Captain-General Weyler Takes the
Fieli Because Ordered to Do
So by Superiors.
KEY WEST, Fla., Dec. s.â Passengers
who arrived to-night from Havana give
interesting information as to the condition
of affairs in Cuba. Feverish excitement
prevails in Havana since the rumor
spread that Weyler intended to return,
announcing, as reported, that he had
pacified the province of Pinar del Rio,
when it is a known fact that Maceo re
mains, bidding defiance to all forces sent
to crush him.
The Spanish are bitter against Weylex's
unsuccessful effort, and say his return will
mean defeat. The official statement of
pacification is ridiculed in the face of the
number of rebels in the province and the
activity displayed recently. Weyler has
established headquarters at Los Palmicos
and sends columns to sweep the country,
leaving trails of fire and blood. All pris
oners captured are killed on the spot. All
who surrender are also killed. The Span
iards are horrified at such slaughter and
destruction.
Meluizo's reported victory was simply a
treacherous surprise of a Cuban hospital.
Forty-live helpless inmates were slaugh
tered. Meanwhile the rebels are display
ing activity all around.
It is said that under cover of the attack
a body of 400 insurgents crossed the line in
to Pinar del Rio and last night again at
tacked the trocha at Zayas station. The
losses are unknown.
When the rebels entered Guanabacoa
Tuesday, tne night after burning twenty-
BiX houses and looting several stores, they
announced that they would soon return
and carried out their threat, as last night
the town was again attacked, several
houses were burned and other stores
sacked, despite the garrison had been re
enforced. Besides, at Guanabacoa the
rebels lately attacked aud burned many
houses at Arrayo, Naranjo, El Cano,
Santa Maria, all within a radius of fifteen
miles of Havana.
The glares of fires are nightly seen in
the city. It is said that news has been re
ceived at the palace that Colonel Aldea
had a serious encounter with Lacret at
Purgatroio Hills in Matanzas. The Span
ish admit they suffered a loss of seventy
five, but claim the victory, saying they
Killed 300 rebels.
It is reported as soon as Weyler returns
a delegation of Spanish planters will peti
tion to be allowed to start grinding. la
case of refusal they will cable to Madrid
asking Weyler's recall.
Among Spaniards Weyler is considered
doomed. It is considered significant that
lie received a curt message from the Min
ister of War saying, "Saiga operaciones,"
that is, "Take the field."
HAVANA, Cuba. Dec. s.â Major Ciru
geda, with the S.ni Quetine battalion, after
a march entailing great hardships, has
captured the rebel position in the Baracoa
Hills, near Junta Brava, in the Havana
province.
The fight lasted two hours, at the ex
piration of which the rebels were dis
peroed, leaving in their flight thirty-three
of their dead on the fi?ld and carrying
away a great many more. The losses of
the troops were one man killed and a cap
tain and ten privates wounded.
Colonel Aldea, with ltX) men, has had a
battle in the Purcatorio Hills, near Saban
illa, in the Matanzas province, which re
sulted in his capturing the rebel position.
The rebels, strong in numbers, made
several rallies, but were repulsed by
cavalry charges. The rebels were finally
all driven from the field, from which they
carried many of their dead. The Spanish
losses were twenty-four privates killed and

The losses of the insurgents are esti

HAVANA IS THREATENED.
Gomez and Ilia Follower* Stake Raids
When They Please.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Dec. 5.-Among
the passengers on the steamship Vigilan
cia, which has just arrived from Havana,
was a young American who has been en
gaged in business in Havana for several
years.
Just before the steamer sailed, he says,
rumors were spread about the city to the
effect that the insurgents were displaying
unusual activity in the provinces of
Matanzas, Pinardel Rio and Santa Clara.
A body of daring horsemen dashed up to
within six miles of Havana, burned a
plantation and e-caped before the squad
ron of cavalry sent out to meet them got
to the scene.
Such incidents as this, which a short
time ago would have created a profound
sensation, are alarmingly frequent now,
the American said. They produco the
double effect of demoralizing the Spanish
soldiery and shaking the belief of resi
dents of the city in the ability of Weyler
to keep the insurgents away from
Havana.
Outwardly the city is quiet, but under
the surface there is much disappointment
at the management of the fepaniajds in
both the military and civic departments.
A third of the inhabitants are friends of
the revolution and many others sympa
thize with it. The rest are with the Span
ish. The Government cannot punish men
now as it could formerly for treasonable
utterances, as it is afraid of precipitating
serious trouble.
Gomez is now investing the town of
Santa Clara. He cut off the garrison from
all communication with the outside world,
and unless relief comes soon the town
will surely fall intq his hands. His cav
alry has been particularly active in de
stroying property "ana cutting off foragiug
parties.
The hopes of the patriots in Havana
have been greatly heightened by these ex
ploits. They think it 19 only a question
of time when Gomez will be under the
walls of Havana itself. The Americana
in Havana, Dearly all of whom are in
sympathy with the revolution, are not bo
sanguine, but they believe that if Gomez
and Maceo hold out until President-elect
McKinley is inaugurated and the new
Congress is iv session, when American in
tervention is expected, they will win.
The Americans do not lay much store
by public sentiment in Havana, because
the Cuban is as easily elated by victory as
he is depressed by defeat. The American
contingent is the only part of the foreign
colony in Havana which leans toward the
rebellion. This probably accounts for the
intense hatred the .Spaniards entertain to
ward Americans.
The Germans, Frenchmen and English
men all incline toward the Spanish side,
and have given Weyler numerous as
surances of their sympathy.
An incident occurred the other day
which painfully illustrates the discredit
into which American citizenship has
fallen.
An American bookseller of the name of
Wilson with a place in one of the princi
pal streets had a sign out in front of bis
store which read "The American Book
store." la one of the outbursts of Spanish
wrath following the Newcastle (Del.) flag
inciden t a crowd coliected about the s>tore
and threatened to loot it. Wilson became
frightened and changed the sign to "The
English Bookstore." There were no more
threats made.
RESTORATION OF TONNAGE DUES.
German Newspapers Declare That Cleve-
land Issued the Proclamation to In
crease His Own Popularity.
BERLIN, Germany, Dec. s.âComment
ing upon the proclamation of President
Cleveland restoring tonnage dues upon
German vessels, the National Zeitung
says that the tonnage dr.es at Hamburg,
Bremen and other ports wil! surely be in
creased, but solely for the purpose of im
proving the harbors for the general bene
fit of shipping, aud not for state purposes,
as in America.
"Foreigners having their own wharves
in Germany," the paper adds, "German
shippers must build their own wharves in
America; Germany will now be deprived
of the advantages she obtained in 1888,
the sacrifice being imposed upon German
ship-owners."
The Freissinnige Zeitung estimates that
the North German Lloyd Steamship Com
pany alone will be subjected to an in
creased expenditure of 150,000 marks and
the Hamburg-American line will suffer to
almost as great an extent.
The Cologne Gazette regards President
Cleveland's proclamation as an effort on
his part to retire from office in a blaze of
glory. The President's assertion that
state tonnage dues are levied at German
ports, however, is erroneous, as the dues
imposed are solely for the use of special
port facilities. In conclusion the Gazette
expresses hope that in the enforcement of
the proclamation "even la the case of
Germans in America," the American
courts will see that the principle of right
and justice is upheld, and that meanwhile
Germany may convince America that
such an infringement of German rights
cannot be accepted.
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND WORDS.
The President's Message Will Be a Most
Exhaustive Vocutnent.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 5.â W. H.
Crook, disbursing clerk of the White
House, will leave this city to-morrow
afternoon charged with the duty of dis
tributing the President's message to the
press so that it can be published contem
poraneously with its delivery to Congress.
The two official copies intended for
formal presentation to the Senate and
House will be in writing according to un
failing custom. The preparation of these
manuscript copies is no light task inas
much as the present message is under
stood to make nearly eighteen thousand
words. The agent of the President will
deliver the printed copies cf the message
to the postmasters of Baltimore, Phila
delphia and New York with directions to
furnish copi-a to the managers of the
United Associated Presses to be re'eased
when the message reaches Congress.
Opposed to Concessions.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 5. â The
members of the joint Congressional Com
mittee appointed to investigate and re
port upon the matter of internal revenue
regulations, with a view to permitting tne
use of free aleo 1 ol in tue arts, returned to
day from New York, where they have
been investigating the matter. No con
clusion has oeen reached on ttie subject,
but it is understood thit a majority oi the
committee are opposed to any concession
in the desired direction being made.
Germany Enters a Protest.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Drc. 5. â The
formal protest of the German Government
against the proclamation of the President
reimposing the tonnage tax on German
vessels in American ports, has been re
ceived at the Department of State. The
President's reply lo this protest and his
reinsertion of the grounds on which the
United States' action has been taken will
probably be made before Congress in the
message on Monday next.

BOLD ROBBERY
AT YUBA CITY
Masked Highwayman En
ters the Southern Pa
cific Depot.
Compels the Station Agent to
Open the Doors of the
Safe.
Less Than Two Hundred Dollars
Found to Pay Him for His
Risk.
YDBA CITY, Cal., Dec. 5.â A masked
man entered the Southern Pacific depot
here at 10 o'clock last night shortly after
the departure of the passenger train for
Marytville and at the point of a revolver
compelled Station Agent S. F. Warren to
deliver up all the money and valuables
tbe office contained. The agent was made
to open the safe and then stand a silent
spectator while tbe interior of the strong
box was rifled.
â¢'â  After taking the cash on hand, the
' bandit went his way and has not been
captured.
Warren gives a pood description of the
man who committed the robbery. The
visitor, he says, was about 5 feet 10 inches
in height and weighed about 160 pounds.
"He wore a small dark mustache of a
few weeks' growth, and was, altogether, a
very 'seedy-looking' individual. His
face was concealed behind a red handker
chief, with eyeholes cat into it."
Warren says that he had extinguished
the lights and locked the doors and
stepped out through the rear entrance to
go to his home.
"Just as I stepped out the fellow pointed
& revolver at me," continued Warren,
"and commanded me to throw up my
hands,-which I did. Then the robber com
manded me to again light up the office,
and 1 began feeling in my Dockets lor
matches, when I was sternly commanded
to keep my hands up.
"The robber said he would look for the
matches, and proceeded to search my
pockets. Finding a match he ignited it
and handed it to me. I entered the office
and lighted the lamps. Then the robber
compelled me to open the safe. He kept
me covered all the time with his revolver,
a weapon of bl ack steel. 1 '
Warren said the robber got $15 of the
railroad company's money and $150 which
belong to the Wells-Fargo Express Com
pany.
"After getting the money," said the
agent, "he forced me to march outdoors
â¢ again. I wanted to stop and lock the
door, but be objected and compelled me to
walk down the street about 300 yards.
"He asKed me if I had a revolver and I
told him that I had not. He evidently
did not believe me, for he searched mv
pockets. Tbe robber then ran away in
. the darkness, going iiÂ» tbe direction of
Marysville. I at once notified the offi
cers."
It is believed that by means of the accu
rate description of the robber whicb Mr.
Warren was able to give, the officers will
be able to capture him.
STRANDED NEAR CHI CO.
The Steamship Red Bluff Caught on a
â  Sand Bar â One of the Deckhands
Drcwned.
CHICO, Cal., Dec. s.â The steamer Red
Bluff, belonging to the Sacramento Trans
portation Company, is stranded on a sand
bar near Squaw Hill, a few miles above !
the Chico bridge. The vessel was on its
way down the river when it undertook a
cut-off, which is its usual custom when
the waters are ud, but this time the water

caught on the bar and will have to remain J
untii high water comes and carries it off. j
The cargo was transferred to another boat.
While this was beinsr done one of the
deckhands was knocked into the river and
drowned before he could be rescued.
STRANGE DEATH AT HIGHCANOS
llanch Employe Killed by a Bean That

SANTA CRUZ. Cal., Dec. s.â The story
of a strange death comes to-day from

LOS ANGELES CRUSADE.
Examination of the First Alleged Offender
Accused by the Parkhurst
Society.
LOS. ANGELES, Cal., Dec. s.â The first
case to go to trial in the sensational Park
hurst Society crusade against violators of
the liauor-selling ordinance and keepers of
disorderly houses was heard this forenoon
in the Police Court, the defendant being
Charies Pickenbach of the Olive saloon.
The witnesses against him were 11. S.
Ryder and Charles Sail, theological stu
dents.
Uuder cross-examination it was devel
oped that shortly before 12 o'clock on the
nlpht in question they had gone to the
saloon and asked to be shown to the lava
tory. They remained in there until after
closing time and then came out and asked
for something to drink.
One called for a glass of beer and the
other for a glass of wine. Pickenbach sug
gested that if the latter was ill he had bet
ter take blackberry brandy. Just how the
! defendant got the idea that the witness
j needed blackberry brandy was a mooted
I question.
When questioned about this matter from
the stand the defendant said :
"When a gentleman comes to me in
distress I wiil help him. I have that
much Christianity that I would help a
sick dog. Therefore, when he asked me
for a flask of whisky, and me thinking
him ill, I sold it to him. Had he came in
fair and square and acted like a man I
should have told him that it was after
hours."
The defense proved an excellent charac
ter for Pickenbach, General C. F. A. Last,
George Zoebelein, Joseph Maier and Dr.
N. Lindenfeldt gave testimony in his be
nalf. The case was taken under advise
ment by Judge Morrison.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
TARDY JUSTICE
COMES TO BAKER
An Innocent Man to Be
Pardoned From San
Quentih.
Spent Three Years in Prison
for Forgery Committed by
Another.
Deathbed Confession of the Real
Culprit Results in His
Release.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. s.â On Mon
day morning the prison gates of San
Quentin will swing open and restore to the
world and to citizenship Edward L. Baker,
who lor three years has been unjustly im
prisoned for a crime which, if the sworn
word of a dying man can be relied upon,
he was never guilty of.
For three long, weary years Edward L.
Baker has been an inmate of San Quentin,
forced to consort with the lowest of hu
manity. Dressed in prison stripe?, he has
gone to his daily task, and when the day
waned he fell into line and entered his
granite cell to hear the iron door clang be
hind him, always tortured by the knowl
edge that he was au innocent man, with
no way of proving that innocence.
The prison annals show that Baker has
been more than an exemplary prisoner,
and has at all times obeyed to the letter
the rules and regulations of the institu
tion. This has been a decided advantage
to the innocent man, and to a certain ex
tent resulted in makine his enforced
servitude less irksome than it would have
been if he bad rebelled at the unjustness
of his fate.
Edward Baker was born in New York
StÃte, and after tbe usual vicissitudes of
childhood and early manhood came to
Los Angeles, where he engaged in mining.
Eventually he and his co-defendant, a
man named Hay, were arrested and
charged with the crime of forgery. At
the trial Hay perjured himself and laid
all of the blame upon the shoulders of
Baker, who was convicted and sentenced
to servÂ« a term of fourteen years in San
Quentin prison.
On December 1, 1893, the prison gates
opened and Baker became one of the
wards of the State.
Once and once only since his term of
imprisonment began has he enjoyed even
partial liberty. That was on February 4,
1894, when he doffed his prison suit for
eight days and went again among his fel
lowmen to testify in a certain case.
Since tbat time hi" co-defÂ«ndanf, Hay,
has passed over to the great majority.
When on his deathbed Hay, stricken by
remorse, called a notary to his aide and
made due acknowledgment of the fact
that be alone was guilty, and that on the
witnpss-stand he had committed perjury
and been instrumental in causing an in
nocent man to suffer for his own crime.
So strongly did Hay's story bear the im
print of truth that many of the influential
men in the southern portion of the State
interest themselves in Baker's case and
laid befor* Governor Budd the circum
stances in such a clear a.nd concise man
ner that it was impossible for the execu
tive not to taka official cosnizance of the
case. The result is that a par.ion has been
signed and will be issued on Monday.
Among those who have been instru
mental in procuring this pardon are Hon.
James McLachlan, formerly District At
torney of Los Angeles County; all the
members of the Grand and petty juries;
Hon. E. M. Koss, United States Circuit
Judge; G- J. Dennis, United States Dis
trict Attorney, and nearly all the Con
gressmen of tue StatÂ°.
On their strong recommendations
Governor Budd granted the pardon. At
torney-General Fftzaerald also recom
mended that Baker be pardoned, as he
was assured tbat Baker was an innocent
man.
SACRAMENTO SUICIDE.
310.en Jock, a Consumptive Mongolian,
Die* by the Rove.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. s.â Mach
Jock, a Chinaman 40 years of age, com
mitted suicide yesterday afternoon in the
basement of a building on I street, be
tween Third and Fourth. Mach Jock had
been in ill health for a long time, suffer
ing from consumption. He was without
means.
The Mongolian ended his life by hang
ing. He tied one end of a rope to a
rafter, rar.de a loop in the dangling end,
and then climbed upon his bed and rested
his chin in the loop. He did not adopt
tbe ordinary method of putting his head
through the loop and then jumping off
into eternity. The Chinaman simply put
his chin over the rope, and still standing
upon the bed, bore down the weight of
his body until he was strangled to death.
MISSING FROM PORTLAND.
Disappearance of a Young Man Who Was
to Have Wedded an Heiress at
Christmas.
PORTLAND, Oee., Dec. s.â Guy Hum
phrey, a popular and well-known young
dental student in the Marquam building,
is among the missing and his friends in
this city are greatly excited over his
strange disappearance. He is the son of
a once very wealthy man here, who lost
his fortune in tbe crash of 1893.
Guy, who is but 21 years old, was en
gaged to wed a beautiful daughter of a
wealthy family here on Christinas day.
Od Thursday Guy left his home as usual
to go to the office, but did not return at
noon. Neither did he put in an appear
ance at dinner time.
His mother, while somewhat concerned,
concluded that he would show up later.
The night passed away without any sign
of Guy. On Wednesday morning Mrs.
Humphrey came downtown and visited
the office in which Guy worked.
There she was informed that nothing
had been seen of him since 10 o'clock the
previous Uay, when ne left the office. His
absence was accounted for by the fact that
for several days he had been complaining
of feeling unwell. It was supposed that
he had gone home after leaving the office.
This morning a young man who was on
intimate terms with Humphrey stated
that on Tuesday about noon he met the
latter on the street and, after shaking
liau.s, Humphrey bate the friend good
by, stating that he was going to take a
little trip over to the Sound.
The friend wished him a pleasant time
and thought nothing further of the mat
ter until be heard of the circumstances
surrounding Guy's departure.
Humphrey's more intimate friends fear
that he has met with a violent death.
VALUE OF THE CAROLENA,
Shipping Men Testify Before the Bering
â â ' tiea Commission. ".â  \; :
VICTORIA, B. 0., Dec. s.â Before the
Bering Sea Claims Commission this morn
ing, Daniel Warner, a shipwright, testified
the schooner 'Carblena was worth $3800
or $4000. During the cross-examination
by Dickenson as to the vessel beltip
brought around the Horn in 1886, Peters
raised the objection that the matter was
new and the witness had already said he
could not fix dates. Dickenson said the
objection was highly technical, and a
somewhat animated debate eosued be
tween the senior counsels for. the respec
tive Governments. Finally Judge Putnam
said they had not thought well to lay
down strict rules, and Judge King said
the same, but added that counsel must
keep the case within the limits of the
pleadings.
The next witness was Captain Sabiston,
who said that in 1884 as good a vessel as
the Carolena could not be bought for less
than $5000. John Clark, a well-known
sealing man, also gave evidence as to the
price of building Bchooners in 1891 and
1892, and the commission adjourned till
Monday.
SAN JOSE WIDOW'S SUIT.
Mrs. Sarah G. Tully Brings Action for
Possession of Her Late Hus
band's Estate.
â¢SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. s.â Sarah G.Tnlly,
widow of the late John Tully, to-day begun
suit against Alary E. Tully, Edward O.
Tully, Isabella Tully, Eleanor Tully,
Joseph Tully and Dorinda Tully, children
of the deceased by a former wife, to re
cover possession of 1263 acres of land in
the Yerba Buena Rancho.
The property involved is situated within
a few miles of this City and is valued at
over $100,000.
In the complaint it is alleged that prior
to October 15, 1894, the plaintiff, Mrs.
Tully, was in possession of said lands, and
at that time the defendants unlawfully
and wrongfully entered into the posses
sion and occupation of said lands and
ousted and ejected her.
The land involved consists of six par
cels, aggregating 1268 acres. The plaintiff
asks for $4000 for the use and occupation
of each piece of land for each year, which
foots up $48,000. The sum of $6000 is also
asked for the wrongful ouster and with
holding of the premises.
There is a long story in connection with
the suit, which dates back to 1886. when
John Tully, who was a wealthy old pio
neer, married bis second wife, the plain
tiff, against the wishes of h's children.
Tully at that time was over 60 years of
age and Mrs. Tully but 25.
Trouble soon came and Mrs. Tully sued
for divorce. While the action was pend
ing Tully deeded all his property to his
children. Judge Belden granted the
plaintiff her divorce and decreed the deeds
iraudulent as to whatever interests she
had, but those rights were not determined.
A few months later Tully and his di
vorced wife were remarried and the prop
erty was deeded to her. Then shortly
before his death, about three years ago, lie
deeded all the property again to his
children.
The suit begun to-day is for the purpose
of having the deeds to tbe children set
aside, and the deeds to the widow* de
clared in force and effect.
Identity of a Dead Man.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. sâ An inquest

STANFORD'S RIVAL ORATORS.
Students Will Contes) for Places on the
Intercollegiate Debating
Team.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec.
s.â The Student Body has elected the fol
lowing Btudent3 to contest in its behalf
for places on the intercollegiate debating
team: J. M. Ross '97, Burton Palmar '97,
J. M. Bell '97, C. E. Schwartz 'y9 and
Switzer '98. ,
Other representatives will be elected by
each of tbe debating societies and from
the entire number the three intercolle
giate debating representatives will be se
lected. It is the intention this year to
have several preliminary debates before
the final selection, not only to determine
on the speakers, but as practice for those
who will represent the university.
Some o' tne faculty members and the
more vitally interested students are agi
tating the institution of a new college
course in elocution and forensic?. It is
hcl'l that such a course would be very
popular and would permit of a peculiar
anil valuable sort of training not now
available here.
There seems to be more interest taken
here in the intercollegiate and Carnot de
bates than usual. Many new men have
avowed their intention to try for a place
among Stanford's representative trio.
Every encouragement will be given them,
and the students are generally hopeful
that Stanford will carry oft the honors in
these debates this year.
The executive committee of the Inter-
Society Debating League selected January
19, 22 and 29 as dates for the preliminary
debates.
Stanford Engineer* to Combine.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec.
5. â Arrangements are now on foot for the
organization of the three local engineer
ing clubs â the civil, electrical and me
chanical â into one large, body, the idea
being to more closely unify the common
interests of the engineers. Committees
from each of the clubs have been ap
pointed to make the arrangements.
â¢ It is probable that this larger club will
undertake the publication of, an engineer
ine journal which will contain the more
important reports, papers and addresses
given by the student members of each of
the clubs and by faculty members in tne
engineering departments
It is not the intention to dissolve tho
separate clubs, which are all in a flourish
ing condition, but merely to bring tnem
into closer relationship by another larger
and more exclusive society.

Rifled.
Masked Highwayman Compels
the Driver to Do His
Bidding.
Government Reward of Fiva Hundred
Do lars Offjrel for His
Capture.

stage running from Los Alamos to Lorn
poc, used exclusively for carrying mail,
was robbed last night at 10 o'clock after
passing the Stuart postoffice, a station
about midway between tbe line's termi
nals, by a tall highwayman, masked and
wearing a large sombrero. He raised to
his shoulder a weapon, which the 10-year
old driver â Miller byname â supposed was
a gun, but which proved to be only a club,
and commanded the driver to stop.
The boy, who was the only occupant of
the stage, obeyed, and was so badly fright
ened that he did not resist wnen the rob
ber began to rifle the mailsacks.
After the robber had looted tbe mail
and taken what he wanted he allowed
the boy to proceed. Miller hurried to
Lorapoc and notified the officers. Deputy
Sheriff Nick Foxen organized a posse and
started in pursuit of tbe outlaw.

ernment for his capture has stimulated

uty Inspector Flint:
Los Angeles, Dec. 5.
Shiriff Hicks, Santa Barbara County : Stage
robbed last night between Lcs Alamos Riii
Loin poc. Government offers a reward of $500.

J. R. Chace Attributes His Financial Mis
fortunes to Exorbitant
Rents.
BANT A CRUZ, Cal., Dec. s.â The fail
ure of J. R, (Jhace has to-day been the ab
sorbing topic of local interest. It is stated
that Mr. Chace has left for Salinas to as
sume the management of a new hotel
there, but this report has not been cor
roborated.
Mr. Chace left a letter for publication,
in which he charges the F. A. Hibn Com
pany with demanding a rent exorbitant
and prohibitive considering the business
depression. The rent was $2500 per an
num for the Ocean House. In the ietter
he foretells disaster for bis successor if the
rent is above $1000 per annum.
The F. A. Hihn Company, he states,
also charged him $15 per month for water,
when tbe city chareed only $7. In South
ern California every assistance is given to
a hotel man, but in Santa Cruz an effort
is made to break him up, Mr. Chace de
clares. Continuing, he says:.
"1 tried to meet my obligations. I
never gambled or drank or spent money
foolishly. I have paid dearly [he refers to
the financial disaster and also to the loss
of his son, Dick, who died from fever in
the Ocean House] for my experience in
the. Ocean House.
This letter is the more significant when
it is remember* d that J. R. Cnace is re
lated to the Hihn family.

LE ROY G, HARVEY
GOES SCOT FREE
He Got $50,000 Worth of
Mrs. Smith's Prop
erty.
Technicalities Â£to:d in the
Way of Successful
Prosecution.
District Attorney Barnes Said the
C mp aining Witnesses Had
Grown Lukewarm.
The indictments against Le Roy G.
Harvey for embezzlement and grand lar
ceny growing out of bis appropriating to
his own use about $50,000 worth of bonds
and other property belonging to his cli
ents have been dismissed.
When the grand larceny case against
Harvey was called by Judge Bahrs yester
day morning it was apparent that there
was but little interest felt in the uroceed
ings by Harvey himself, who evidently
knew that he wa3 soon to be freed from
further responsibility for hU extensive
peculations. There was no pretense that
he did not get the money, but it seemed
to bo agreed that be had so far imposed on
the trustfulness of Mrs. Emily A. i\ Smith
and her daughter that it would be difficult
to secure a verdict of conviction.
Harvey appeared to be particularly well
pleased "with himself, and it was noted
! that he was by far the best dressed man
! in the courtroom, not even excepting his
Honor Judge Bahrs ana District Attorney
Barnes, both of whom are strictly up to
j date in the matter of wearing apparel. It
could scarcely be expected, however, that
mere public officials could outshine a
financier like Harvey, whose superior
j nbiliUes have placed at his disposal a fund
I of $50,000 tliat he may safely devote to
i personal adornment.
lie lore moving to dismiss the charge of
\ grand larceny against Harvey the District
Attorney read and filed with the clerk of
the court the following letter:
San Francisco, Nov. 25. 1896.
Hon. W. S. Barms, J'ittn'ct Attorney, San Fian
ci<c>. i al â DEAS >IR". My d.iughier and I are
the I'ompinining witnesses In the cases ot the
People Hgainst Le Roy G. Harvey now pending
trial in Judge Bahrs' court. Since tne former
trinl on another charge, which resulted in ac
quittal of Harvey, we have comp to the con-
L-iusion that, under all the circumstances of
the case, we do not wish to proceed further
with the matter, and therefore we request you
I to dismiss the charges.
Trusting that this will meet with your ap
; probation and action, 1 remain, yours "truly,
Emily A. P. Smith,
Maude A. smith.
Mr. Barnes said that on account of the
peculiar circumstances under which Har
vey obtained possession of the properly
! and the lukewarm feeline and disinclina-
I tion of the complaining witnesses to pro
' ceed witli a vigorous prosecution, he
j could not feel much hope of securing a
conviction. It appeared to be a breach of
trust on the part of Harvey, who had
i taken advantage of the confidence reposed
| in him by the ladies whose property he
i had appropriated.
Tbe ruling or the court at Harvey's for
i mer trial on the charge of embezzlement,
I wherein tlie same property was concerned,
was also referred to by Mr. Barnes. As
the jury then had been instructed to
acquit, it seemed that without tne hearty
cooperation of Harvey's.victims it would
i be a waste of the public funds to proceed
further with a trial when a conviction
would be almost out of the question.
Judge Bahrs wanted to know if the
i District Attorney moved to dismiss the
! case, and Mr. Barnes replied in tne affirm
| ative, whereupon an oraer was entered in
I accordance with the District Attorney's
request.
Harvey stalked haughtily from the
j courtroom.

QUACKENBUSH'S PROPERTY
Suits Involving Over a Million Dollars

Nancy A. Quackenbush, who claims to

Quacfcenbush, though he coyly denies the
soft impeachment, has filed an amended

Some time ago Qnackenbush instituted

tract, and hy viruie of which she claimed
to be his wife. He said such pÂ»per, if it
really exist, is a forgery, and he demanded
that'it shall be canceled and destroyed by
order of the court.
The lady's response was to sue him for
$500 permanent aliruonv, but just before

Joseph Seeley, lale of thp Pomona, went
out a3 chief steward, vice T. K. James, re
signeJ. The latter was down to see the
j last of his old ship and the reception he
! receive! must have been most gratifying
Ito nim. The passengers thronged around
I him ana all ana sundry wished him suc
cess in nis new venture. Mr. James goes
to New Orleans to manage one of the
largest hotels in that city. For years he
was in the employ ot the Pacific M.'.ii Com
pany, and made many a trip to China en
the City of Kio de Janeiro. The day he
resigned from the Australia he had just
finished bis one hundredth trip, but was
compelled to make another run. as the
company could not get a suitable man to
' take bis place.
James was giving some of his reminis
cences on the wharf alter the vessel had
I sailed to a party of his friends. "It was
on the Rio de Janeiro, and Freeman was
purser then as now," said he. "We were
on our T.ay to Yokohama and we met
I nothing but a succession of gales. Every-
I body was seasick, and the son of a niiilion
| aire Milwaukee brewer was th', worst of
| the whole lot. Time and asjain he asked
j me for something to pive him relief, but
; nothing would stay on his stomach.
1 One day when there was a very heavy
i sea on ho said, 'Oh ! Jarue*, if you would
| only give me Bomeibing that would stick
i to my insides for half an hour I would be
I cut ami about inside of six hours.' 'I'll
fix you,' was my remark, ani his face
showed the joy my words brought. 'If
you do/ said ne, 'you will earn my eternal
gratitude.' I hurried to the purser's room
and got a Oottle of mucilage. Witn that
I went back to the young millionaire's
stateroom and handing it to him said:
â¢Here, drink that; if it doesn't stick to
j your insides, why nothing concocted on
this sublunary sphere will.' He looked at
me. looked at the mucilage and then burst
into a roar of laughter. 1 think that
laugh cared him, 83 he was up and about
j next day." James will probably leave for
I New Oneans the latter part of this week.

The new Humboldtcame down in tow
of the Ship-owners' and Merchants' Tow
boat Company's Rescue yesterday. The
run from oar to bar was made in 25 hours
30 minutes, which is remarkably quick
time. After unloading at ihe foot of Ihird
street the new boat will go to the Fulton
Iron Works to have her boilers put in.
The new boat has alieady been described
in The Call and a cut of Her published,
so the readers of this paper will easily
recognize her when she jroes out on her
trial trip the end of the month. The
Rescue did i.ot waste any time here but at
once coaled up and during the afternoon
started for Eureka with the barkentine C.
C. Funk in tow. The latter will load red
wood lumber for Sydney.
AmoiiEr the arrivals yesterday afternoon
was the British ship Bacchus in tow of tne
tug Active, and the liathdown in tow of
the Vigilant.
The scow schooner Erie met with a
peculiar accident at Port Costa yesterday.
6he was on her way to the mills with a
Joad of grain and had a northwest wind
and ebb tine to help her alonj;. While she
was still two miles away the British bark
Invercoe was towed out into the stream
by the tug Vigilant and there dropped,
while the tug got out her hawser to tow
the vessel to ti&n Francisco. The scow
came tailing along and got dangerously
near the stationary ship. "Luff! luff!"
yelled the captain of the luvercoe, out ti.e
men on the scow attempted to nut about
and before the schooner ga.hered way Â»he
was under the bark's quarter. A few
minutes later it was discovered that the
scow was leaking badly, so Captain Silo
vich was told to haul in His hawser and go
to her assistance. The Invercoe came to
an anchor and the EriÂ» was run on the
Benicia mud flats. The schooner is not
badly damaged, but the wheat cargo will
probably be a total loss
A peculiar state of affairs exists between
Balfour, Guthrie & Co. and Captain Hicks
oi the British bhip Manchester. The ves
sel is chartered to load wheat at the line
raie of Â£16>9d (freights are now going
bepeing at 18s 9d) and Balfour, Guthrie
& Co. are loading her. The Stockton
steamers have put in several loads and
Captain Hicks has all along been grumb
ling at the sacks in whicii the wheat is
sent dowu. He says they are no good and
yesterday refused to receive another con
signment because of the state they were
in. He lurther notified Balfour, Guthrie
& Co, that if the sacks of wheat now in
the hold were not repaired lie would have
all tbe wheat put on.the wharf at owner's j
expense to-morrow. The grain tirm
laugh at his threats and want Hicks to go
ahead as that would mean the abandon
ment of the charter and the saving at
least of 8s a ton for them.
A barge loaded with brick went adrift
from Fort Point yesterday afternoon with

CHURCH WINDOWS BROKE
Boys Shooting at Pigeons Do
Much Damage at St.
Ignatius.
The Numerous Broken Parts Are
N&w B-inÂ» Replaced by
Local Art sts.
When the fathers of St. Ignatius Church
on Hayes street had the four magnificent
windows sst up in the facade of the church j
they did not deem it necessary to protect j
i the glass with wire screens. Now they j
! find to their surprise that this oversight
I will cost them several hundred dollars,
i besides much trouble in repairing the
damage done.
Somewhere about the same time that the
great windows were placed in position !
pigeona first made their homes high up!
in the eaves of the church buildinp. The i
; birds used to fly about the street and j
! alight on cornices near the windows, j
I This was early impressed on small boys
of the neighborhood, who found a new but
mischievous in shooting at the
birds. Airguns and catapults were em- !
ployed by the boys, who generally stood j
; across the street in a va<ant iot, from j
! which vantage ground they carried on j
j their hurtful play. No particular atteti- j
j tion was paid to them, but lately when the j
! windows were examined it was discoy- j
ered that as many as thirty-eight panes in |
the pictorial class which represents van- j
oils subjects of church history had been
destroyed.
These broken parts included portions of
figures and the decorative sec. ions, so that
it was necessary to place the work of re
pairing in t ho hands of a competent local
artist. Owing to the great size and har
monious color scheme of the subjects in
I the windows it required a nice coiisidera-
I tion of the general arrangement to have
the new pieces conform with the rest.
These windows are among the finest of
their kind on the Pacific Coast, having
I been made in Munich for the facade ot St.
j Ignatius Church from designs by eminent
i artists. The beauty of these works of art
! has been seriously impaired, but the dcli
i cate task of replacing and matching the
j broken portions has been intrusted to a
j loctl artist, whose ability is a guarantee
| that the uamage can be repaired. For
some days past men have been working
on the windows, and others preparing
strontÂ» wire screens for protection against
vagrant missires.

Barclay Bonthorn and "W. Gordon Ross,
of Johannesburg, and Theolore Haddon
of Buluwayo, South Africa, all owners of
gol i properties in the Dark Continent, ar
j rived here yesterday ana registered at the
I Palace.
Mr. Bonthorn commanded a corps of
mounted Scots in the Jamison raid and
Mr. Ross was a member of the
committee of the Scottish corps,
which consisted of 2500 armed men.
They were ready to do battle on many oc
casions, but when the war wes entirely de
clared off they resumed the peaceful occu
pjition of mining.
They are now on their way to British
Columbia to examine some pold proper
ertiea. They will visit the new and. thrifty
camp of Kossiand, and will spend some
time in looking over the mines ol Trail
j Creek.
Mr. Bonthorn says Ihnt notwithstand-
I ing contrary reports the Johannesburg
district is going steadily ahead.
"The output is increasing," he said. "It
is averaging about 800,000 ounces of cold a
month, or about IfG.OX), 000. Developments
on new properties are revealing additional
bodies of mineral. Wherever prospecting
is bsing intelligently done it is met with
reward.
"The same interest continues. Things
are not as wild us they were, so far as
stock speculations are concerned, but in
every other way tnere is life and all that
could be desired. 1 predict the country
will go right alon^, so iar as gold mining
is concerned."
"It is rather slow about Buluwayo, in
Rhodesia," said Mr. Haddon. "Tne war
is entirely over, however, the natives hav
j inp ceased hostilities. But we are 700

ELOPED FROM
REDWOOD CITY
Flight of John Tribolet
and Miss Jennie
Clifford.
Bslieved to Have Come to San
Francisco to Procure a
License.
The Ycu'h Is but Eighteen and t c
Ma. den Tw.nty Years of
Age.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Dec. sâ The
elopement sensation has given whatever
gossiping dames there are hereabouts a
choice morsel upon which to exchange
heir "I told you 509." Late yesterday
afternoon John Tribolet and Miss Jennie
Clifford were seen by friends driving
southward toward Menlo Park, where
they probably boarded the train bound
for San Francisco, as they were seen
together when the train passed through
Redwood City. They attempted to evade
detection by pulling down the blinds of
the car window. Their actions aroused
suspicion and the Sheriff's office was com
municated with. The Sheriff commenced
pursuit, intending to prevent any con
templated marriage and bring them back
if possible. Thus far his efforts to find
the couple have been unsuccessful.
The affair has created considerable talk
here, because of the youth of the elopers
and their prominence socially. Young
Tribolet is only 18 years of age and Miss
Clifford two years older. They have been
keeping company for some time past, but
their infatuation for each other was be
lieved to be no more than temporary. It
is not believed that they will be able to
procure a marriage license, as the young
man does not appear to be over 16 years
old.
Henry G. Tribolet, the father of the run
away, is an old and respected citizen of
Redwood City, having been in the hotel
business here for many yoars. He has
amassed considerable wealth.

had been employed at a salary of $60 per
month and board. It had been customary
for him to handle $300 or $400 worth of

having implicit confidence in him, re-
Quired him to make monthly reports and
remittances only. When he failed to re

they came to Redwood City yesterday to

SANTA ROSA INDICIVENE.
Grand Jury A< cusi-x iCx-Heeorder Ball
of Htnbeezlement.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Dec. 5. â The
Grand Jury has returned a second indict
ment against ex-County Auditor and Re
corder Gil P. Hall, charging him with
the embezzlement of $34 15. There are
also three civil suits pending against Mr.
Hall and his bondsm.-n.
The jury finished its labors to-day after
a se-sion of several weeks. It recommends
that the office of Auditor and Recorder be
segregated by the Supervisors, believing
thai the entire time of one man should be
expended in keeping the county's ac
counts. It is the opinion of the Grand
Jury that the change should be made on
the first Monday in January, 1899, and
that separate candidates be voted for at
the general election of November, 1898.
Tl.T 1 . is also recommended tbat no county
official act as notary public.
The jury found all of the county offices
and institutions in good condition. Only
eight complaints were heard during the
session and fotir true bills were found.
MADE A STAKE
ON THE NEW ERA
The Fitzgeralds Who Sold
It for $80,000 Are
in the City.
Wonder 'u! Progress of Sonora
and Jimtown and the Mines
About There.
Among the arrivals in the City are the
Fitzgerald brothers, who lately sold the
well-known New Era iiold mine in Tuol
umne County lor $80,000 in cash. The
New Era is near Fort Juan and about
six miles west of Sonora. It is a hand
some property, being on the mother lode,
and showing a vein, as is stated, from
twenty to thirty feet wide.
The Fitzgeralds have been at the Grand
for the last day or two. They are natives
of Tuoiumne County, and acquired the
mine three or four years ago. The devel
opment of tho property consists largely oj
a 200-foot shaft. It is by this that the ore
is reached.
"This mine is one of tbe best in that
part of Tuolumne," said a gentleman yes
terday who is well informed regarding
the mines of that region. "An enormous
vein has been exposed, and I look lor rich
returns from it.
"The property is situated right alongside
of the Jumper, and it was to the Jumper
Company that it was sold. It is to be
openod out now for all it is worth. Tbe
three Fitzgerald boys wto have just sold
it are practical miners and are familiar
with every property in Tuolumne.'
Among the raining men who are here
from Tuolumne is Howard M. Preston,
who sold the Whisky Hill and other prop
erties some time since, and is now putting
in an ice and electric plant in Sonora. The
visitors say that the activity keeps ud in
Tuolumne. Many men are going there
and investing in property.
Sonora, the old California m : ning town,
which was for a long time very dull, has
taken on a new lease of liie. Tbe improve
ments which begun a year or two ago are
being continued, and the city is thrifty
and enterprising. Jimtown, on which for
a time the dust of ages seemed to have
settled, has got quite skittisn and active.
It is doin ' business at the old stand some
thing as it was in the early days.
It is believed that the mines which now
show up so well about there will become
great ana steady producers. All the
Tuolumne County men now here have a
cheerful look.
FILCHER'S IDEA
FOR A BUREAU
The Novel Structure He
Would Have for a State
Exhibit.
Opinions as to Locating the Min
ing Building in Golden
Gate Park.
George A. Knight is the attorney who
ias been requested to look up the law and
prepare a bill for the establishment and
maintenance by the State of an extensive
raining exhibit and another of the other
irouucts of the State, as announced in
rhe Call. As yet a diaft of the bill has
lot been' prepared, but it will, it is ex
pected, be drawn up for presentation dur
ne the early part of the next session of
he Legislature.
J. A. Filcher, secretary of the State
3oar<i of Trade, in discussing the pro
posed bill said that he was in favor of a
raiiding in which there could bo made an
ixtensive display of all the products of
California.
"My idea," said be, "is that the build
ing should be in the shape of tbe State,
tfith a section set apart to represent each
:ounty just as they are shown on the map.
iVhere tlie division lines are in the map
:here ought to be walks. In each county
here should be a full exhibit of every
produci, and each county should furnish
reliable data about these products and tbe
rei-ources-. Such a building would be edu
cational in a high degree, and would give
people at a giance the relative position of
>ne county to another. Such a building
would be an odd-shaped one, of course,
and would require a laree cite, and with
that idea in view Golden Gate Part would
be a good location ior it.
"In my judgment there ought to be in
such a building all tbe public offices that
are maintained at the expense of the State
and which are scattered in every
direction."
Julian tsonntag, secretary of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association, said that while
an exhibit of the minerals of the State is
good in its way and might as well be in
Golden Gate Park as anywhere else he did
not think that was what was wanted to
induce people to develop the mineral re
sources of the State.
'â This State," said the secretary, "ought
to make a liberal allowance to enable the
State mineralogist to procure full, reliable
:iatu about every mining district in the
State, which he cannot do now for want
af the means required. The mining in
terest is, in my opinion, the most import
ant in the State to-day, and in order to
properly develop it there should be reliable
figures, maps and charts, so that those in
search of information could obtain it.
Pitty thousand dollar:, a year for live years
expended for tne Mining Bureau, which at
t^iis time is of but little value, would re
sult in attracting people to this State, who
would develop its mineral resources, and
the expenditure oi that amount of money
would be worth hundreds of millions of
dollars to the State. If anything is to be
done to increase the usefulness of the
Mining Bureau it should be in the line of
enabling it to gather information which
could be relied upon rather than in the
matter of an exhibit.
"As to a State exhibit, that is well
enough as an attraction, but what the
State needs is more manufactures and a
determined movement against convict
manufactured goods."
John J. Crawford, State mineralogist,
said that while he was favorable to a move
ment that would increase the usefulness
of the Mining Bureau and would preier a
site in the park to the present loca
tion, he did not think the place a suitable
choice owing ,to the distance. He
thought it ought to be in a central loca
tion.
Joseph Austin, president of the Park
Commissioners, said that if the State
would establish tho Mining Bureau and
State exhibits in the park there would be
found plenty of room for the building or
buildings necessary, and suggested as to
the style of structure that ought to be left to
competition by architects. He was of the
opinion that such exhibits as have been
suggested would be ot the greatest benefit
to tbe State and City.
Presence of md.
A young woman in a Western State,
who lives near to a railway crossing, look

a laborer jump from one track to the
other to escape an approaching freight

HIS LIFE SPENT
AMONG LEPERS
Father Conrardy Tells of
the Molokai Island
Colony,
Experiences of the Priest Who
Succeeded the Revered
Damien.
Will Return to His Charge After
Fitting Himself as a Phy
sician.
PORTLAND. Or., Dec. s.â Rev. Father
L. L. Conrardy, who left the Umatilla In
dian reservation in 1889 to tafce the place
ot the late Father Damien, in charge of
the Molokai (Hawaii) leper colony, is here
visiting Archbishop Cross. A few months
ago he went to Japan to visit the leper
colony of Gotamba, near Yokohama.
What he witnessed tbere impelled him to
the belief that it was his duty to return to
civilization and lit himself as a physician
and surgeon by a course of study, and he
is on his way to place himself under the
instruction ol Dr. Monnet of Chicago.
"When I left Molokai," said Father
Conrardy in an interview this morniig,
"thftre were just an even 1200 lepers in the
three settlements on the island. Of these
17 are white men, 2 white women, 25 Chi
nese and 1156 Hawaiians â that is, includ
ing half breeds, with negro, Chinese, Ja
panese and Caucasian blood in their veins.
"Leprosy is not a contagious disease ex
cept by inoculation. Let a person take
proper precautions as to cleanliness and
never allow any part of bis skin that may
be in any way abrased or broken to come
into contact with the person of a leper
and he may go on for years living among
them without contracting the disease."
"How, then, did Father Damien con
tract it ?" was asked.
"Through his inability to refuse at
tendance on a boy who had been badly
hurt in an accident," replied the mission
ary. "Father Damien was suffering from
a badly hruised hand, but binding the
wound with antiseptics and trusting for
the best, he dressed the boy's wounds.
His precautions were useless. He had be
come inoculated, and it, was not long be
fore the marts oi a leper appeared upon
him.
"There are two stages, or rather grades,
of leprosy. One is the anesthetic leprosy
and the other the tuberculous. The rirst
is characterized by a suffusion under the
skin and a drawing up of the chords and
tendons without any eating away of the
T>arts. The other is accompanied by a
sloughing away of the flesh, particularly
about the nose and ears, and the loss of
the first joints of the fingers and toes. It
is this latter leper who carries with him
the most dread of inoculation to the clean
person.
"Here is a sad case," continued Father
Conraidy, producing a bundle of photo
graphs and selecting one, pointing out the
figure of an old, white-bearded man,
who^e sightless eyes and shortened fin
gers told of his horrible condition. "This
man is Captain Clayton Strong, once the
master of a smart trading schooner Diyinjr
among the South Sea Islands. For fif
teen years he has been a resident of
Molokai, a leper.
"For ten years he has been paralyzed
and for seven years blind. He is a Puila
delphian. and has wealthy relatives in
Illinois, but they reluse to communicate
with him, despite several letters I have
written to them in his behalf. The o<l
man is 56 years of age, and has been among
the natives of the South Seas since he was
a lad 16 years old, having run away from
a whaling bark at that tiice.
"His case is remarkable owing to tbe
wonderful' vitality which keeps him alive.
The usual life of a leper who is afflicted
with the disease after reac ing maturity
is six years. Children are seldom able to
withstand the ravages of the disease
over one year alter it has made its
appearance.
"We have on Molokai three distinct set
tlements, stretching along the beach for a
distance of about four miles. These are
occupied by the adult males, the boys and
girls, and the women, respectively. In
charge of these are six Catholic brothers
and five Sisters of Charity."
After finishing his course of medicine
Father Conrardy will return to Molokai,
relieving Father Damien, a brother of the
dead priest.

BATTLED FOR A
BALLOT SYSTEM
Mechanics' Institute Mem
bers Hold a Lively
Discussion.
The Vote Proves Proportional
Representation an Easy
Winner.
Tiie First Installment of Nominations
Hade of Trustees for the
Coming Year.
There was a lively members' meeting of
the Mechanics' Institute last evening. It
was nominally a quarterly meetinE, but
the two last quarterly meetings having
failed of a quorum the business of nine
months was to be attended to. It was
early made plain that there was no danger
of a lack of a quorum at last evening's
meeting.
Before the hour for the opening every
chair provided was occupied and the
ushers were bftsily finding new accommo
dations. It was understood that the long
pending agitation in regard to the method
of electing trustees was to be put to an
issup, and many who <iid not intend to
participate in the contest came in antici
pation of watching a battle royal. They
were noi disappointed.
After the reading of the minutes Presi
dent E. A. Denicka made a brief verbal
report in which he stated that there had
been no change in the Post-street prop
erty except to remove the reading-room
from the basement to an upper floor. He
congratulated the members upon the
success of the late fair, which, in spite of
hard times and although tbe admission
fee was reduced one-half, paid within
about $2000 of the profits of the previous
exposition.
The Sixteenth-street property, he stated,
woula be leaded again to the parties who
are now conducting a recreation grounds
tbere.
The report of the secretary showed that
the receipts, including cash on hand, for
tbe last three quarters were $68,788 35 and
the disbursements $67,697 04, leaving a
balance of $1091 31 on hand.
The prefhs of the late fair were shown
to have been $8149 57. The librarian's re
port showed the number of members on
the roll at present to be 4789.
The bone of contention was then
brought forth. Seer tary Cummings r ad
an a.menciment proposed at a previous
meeting providing for tne instituiion of
the majority system of voting for trustees,
in lieu of the preferential and proportional
system now in vogue.
The latter system has for four years been
the special pride of a number of enthusi
astic members of the organization. They
have advocated eariy and late its adop
tion by mu'iicipaliiy, State and Nation,
and their efforts nave resulted in its adop
tion in a number of local clubs and soci
eties.
It was well understood that any effort
to attacK this cherished institution would
meet with determined opposition by its
adherents. But it had determined op-
Donents.
Thomas Clare, who introduced tie
amendment, spoke at length in lavor of
the measure. He declared that the man
ner of election he advocated was a plain
proposition of justice.
The proportional method he declared
preferential, mysterious and rascally.
â¢'This fcrm of voting," he dec ared,
"would be very well if we could know that
about election time we could get men
above ordinary human nature. But how
can weknow that? It is the rottenest
thing the Mechanics' Institute was ever
guilty of and is corruption from begin
ning to end."
C. M. Oummings, one of the trustees,
said it was to remedy injustice that the
proportional system was inaugurated.
"By the old system if 1000 votes were cast,
501 persons could vet together and elect
the entire board, and 'the 499 would have
no representation whatever."
Mr. Cummings terminated I. is remarks
with a motion that tho matter be indeti
nitely postponed. A. M. Clark designated
the motion an effort to gag the meeting,
and a spirited tilt ensued. The chair re
fused to put the motion, and Thomas
Clare, who had previously been inter
rupted, was allowed to proceed. lie was
followed by L. E. Phillips, who earnestly
advocated the amendment.
The proportional system, he contended,
perpetuated cliques and was so abstruse as
to be beyond the metes and bounds of
human understanding.
Trustee P. J. Healey defended the pro
portional system as a marvel of simplicity.
He explained tne system and staled that
there was nothing abstruse about it, ex
cept to those who did not desire to under
stand.
A. M. Clark characterized the propor
tional system aa undemocratic and unre
publican. "Mr. Cummings advocates it,"
he said, "because, after being elected by
the majority system, he finds he can keep
himself perpetually in office."
"I can see in the discussion to-night,"
said Charles W. Plum, "nothing but a
spirit to tear down, instead of to build up.
"If this plan is not the most democratic
it has certainly served this association
well. We have tried it for iour yearsâ try
it once more. I say vote for the amend
ment."
Joseph A. Leggett decried the criticism
of the institute and its management
which some of the speakers had voiced.
He gave it as his opinion that such a
course was not for the interest of the asso
ciation. "Don't you be afraid of the pref
erential and proportional system of vot
ing," he said. "It will give you fair play,
justice and good government."
Alfred Cridge, the father of the institute,
spoke in favor of the proportional system,
a? did H. C. Kenny and Attorney Reed.
L. E. Phillips offered an amendment to
the amendment umier discussion. This
action precipitated a parliamentary de
bate, the chair ruling the amendment
out of order.
The original amendment was then put
to a vote, and the proposition to do away
with proportional representation was de
feated by a vote of 13 to 59.
L. E. Phillips then offered an amend
ment similar to the one defeated to be
voted for at the next meeting.
Trustee P. J. Healy offered two amend
mentsâone providing that the president
must call a special meeting at the request
of twenty-five members in good standing,
and the other providing for the publica
tion in the institute bulletin of notices of
quarterly meetings.
The latter proposition is advanced in
view of tbe trustees' intention to publish a
regular monthly bulletin. Announce
ments in this way save a great outlay in
postal cards.
The election by the trustees of Henry
Root as trustee, vice G. Howard Thomp
son, resigned, and George H. Wallis as
secretary, vice Joseph M. Cummings, re
signed, were unanimously approved.
Nominations for trustees were declared
In order, and the following names were
submitted: D. A. McDonald, A. J. Mc-
Nichols, L. K. Phillips, A. F. Allen, R. p.
Clement, S. L. Taylor, A. R. WMls, M. A.
Wheaton, G. B. Meriani, S. G. KHiogg, E.
A. .Denicke, F. T. Doian and Dr. C. A.
Kern. Nominations will rrnain open

OAKLAND WON THE GAME.
The High School Team Across the Bay
Vanquished Lowell High at
Football.
The Oakland High School football team
completely defeated the Lowell High
School eleven of this City yesterday after
noon :on the Central Park gridiron. The
score wa3 28 to 0. â¢
On the Saturday before the rival high
schools had played, a -tie game, neither
aide being able to score. Their second
match was to decide which should contest
with St. Matthew's School of San Mateo
on next Saturday, December 12, for the
State academic championship. Oakland
was. conceded the advantage before the
game, for Lowell High had been ma
terially weakened by the loss of the two
Bishop | brothers, whose i playing was a
feature of Lowell's game the week before.
This loss in itself had something to do
with the result, though Oak. and High de
serves credit for the wonderfully improved
game her team ; put up. Oakland's play
was much faster, her backs were remark
ably quick in darting for and finding a
hole in the Lowell High School line, and
QuarterbacK Russ and little Collier at left
end four times made connection on the
seldom successful quarterback kick, and
for gains of from twenty to - thirty yards
each time. These quarterback kicks and
the skillful catching and plucky tackling
of the diminutive Collier, by far the light
est man in the field, were distinct features
of Oakland's play. r
"Where but two punts were attempted
during the whole game *on the previous
Saturday, and those by Lowell High, yes
terday no ' less ; than twelve punts were
made by both teams in the second half
alone.
The present apparent prospects of the
State academic championship were tritely
sized up at the game yesterday by Porter,
the Olympic tackle oi '95 and '96, the Cali
fornia Varsity half of '94, the Amherst
player of '88, and the St. Matthew's School
teacher and coach from '90 to '93. "Oak
land High. School," he said, "is putting
up a tine game and I'm afraid she'll prove
too much for San Mateo next Saturday."
Heretofore San Mateo has been con
sidered pretty sure of the first place, so
this sudden improvement in Oakland's
chances promises a good contest lor the
final game to be played at the Presidio
grounds next Saturday afternoon. . ..
Both Huh schools were well repre
sented in the grand stand by students
wearing the blue of Oakland and the
scarlet and white of the local school, and
their clamorous chorused yells added to
the spirit of the occasion. Along the side
lines were a number of men who in their
schoolboy days had owed allegiance to
one or the other of the rival schools.

HE MADE HIS MARK
And Then Could Not Getty
His Signature Honored.
A LAWYER'S PREDICAMENT
Photographs Are Not Used for
Identification, but Signatures
Are.
"When they talk about positively iden
tifying a man in a criminal case by big
personal appearance only," said a promi
nent attorney of this City a day or two
ago, "I always have a ulight feeting of
pity for the accused, no matter who he
may be. And that Is all because of ray
very positively refusing to identify one of
my own clients, and that, too, not long
ago. But it was, I admit, under condi
tions that, thank heavens, are not found
every day in life."
Pressed for detaib as to the matter he
said: 'Mr. Long, who has beeu for years
a client of mine, as well as being my per
sonal friend, calle \ at the office one day,
and, while I had known that he was a
pr tty sick man for some time, he ap
peared to me to be rather more worried ,
and pale than usual. After some pre
liminary talk, addressing rue by my
my Christian name, he said : 'George, I
am going away, to begone six months.
I am getting wor>e rather tnan better, and
all the physic that I am pourinsr into nfte
does me no good. I have resolved on 4i
chance of air. My interests will wafit m
good deal of attention during my nbsen^J,
and if you are willing I wish you would
draw up a power of attorney for me (men
tioning whom he wished named In the
document), and then it you'll get me out
some notes as to just how my property
stands at present I'll feel better satisfied
to go off and rest.' The news did not sur
prise me much, for he was pretty shaky,
and although he had tried innum rable
remedies and doctors to the point of folly
be seemed to be 'iosing ground' all the
time. A couple of days after I wa? able to
send him word that the power of, attorney
was ready and the memorandums of bis
affairs completed. Next afternoon be
came down to the office, and it seemed to
me that even then I could notice a change
for the worse since I had seen him last.
His band â never very steady for a couple
of year.- â shooK so that he cou.d not sign
his name, and he had to simply make a
cross, which I got duly witnessed, and
when everything was completed to his
satisfaction" he porketed the papers and
off he went in a carriage. For months L
heard nothing of bim, until one day out in
the park 1 saw a man ho resembled him
somewhat in his former days, but it was
only a passing glance and I paid no
attention at all to it.
"During the time that I failed to see or
bear of him the gentleman who had his
power of attorney was continually send
ing me sums of money so. that I might
place tbem to Mr. Long's credit, the
understanding being that I was to honor
any draft that Long migtit make on me
from anywhere. Through one of the lead
ing banks one day I got a draft purporting
to have been drawn by him for $200. The
writing was somewhat like Long's had
been some years before, when it was hold
and firm, but it bore no resemblance to
nis wretchedly weak scrawls of the past
two years; and then aga'n I remembered
that when I saw him last he couldn't
write at all. I tried to got at his friend,
but he was out of town, and so of course I
returned the draft with a note saying it
was not signed by Long. Two days atter
came a telegram asking me to come to
Santa Cruz and bring some money. Ir.
was signed 'Long.' I went down, a>jÂ£^|
on arriving at the hotel was told that &+^U
Long was on the veranda, I was waikinj^
around the porch when a man came up to '
me and shook me by the hand lieartily,
saying, 'Why, George, I'm very glad to
see you.' The voice was Long's, but tho
face and form, no. 'Wnat does all this
mean?' I asked. 'Yes, I see,' he said,
'you do not believe it is me. I can't he^p
it, but it is. I had intended to send you
my photogiapii when I drew on you, but
remembering that that would not helD
identify mo, and knowing that I could not
write in that old thaky way that you
knew so well any more, I just asked you
down.' It was hours beiore I was actually
convinced. Here wax the wreck of a ner
vously prostrated man brought back to
perfect health. In 'he evening he told me
what he had done. He had driven straight
from my office to the great Hudson Medi
cal Institute, on the corner of Stockton,
Market and Ellis streets, and placed niin
self unreservedly in the hands of the doc
tors there. He had stayed in seclusion in
the City for three months, not letting any
one know where he was, and then he had
come down here for a short rest. 'What
treatment on earth did they give you?' I
asked, almost in awe. 'Nothing but that
marvelous "Great Hudyan 1 ' of theirs,' he
said; and producing a stack of reading
matter out of his porket, which he says
the Institute sends" to all inquirers, ha
said: 'Read some of that testimony;
tbeie are many quite as wonderful case-j
as mine.' I did so. and there certainly
are some most astounding cures â some
having been made in thirty days."

MARKET ST.S.F^Â£SS/W.A. CLARK THE
COPPER KING
.... Tells of the Big Forces at
Work on the United
Verde.
.He Is N.w Putting Up Five
Great Structural Steel
Buildings.
; : The Mine Producing Forty Tons of
â¢ . Copper Dailyâ Big Sugar Works
'.: ' for Orange County.
W. A. Clark, the mining ning of Mon
tana and Arizona, arrived here yesterday
on his way to Butte, in the former State.
He came from his famous United Verde
copper mine 3in Arizona, and will only re
main a day.
Mr. Clark is engaged in many enter
prises. Be-ides mining enormous quanti
ties of copper and oth^r minerals, reduc
ing ores, banking and doing other busi
ness, he is now building a sutrar factory
near Anaheim to cost between $400,000 and
1500,000. He said concerning the United
Verde copper mine at Jerome, which he
owns:
"It is now producing about forty tons, or
$0,000 pounds, of copper a day. This
means the mining of a good many hun
. Sred tons of ore daily. The copper is
almost pure, being 99V4 per cent fine. The
small remaining impurity is taken out in
â  the Ka-t, where' it can be done, because of
thedifference in the price of labor, cheaper
â¢ than I can do it myself.
"I am making some improvements â
putting everything under steel to pre
': vent fire. To this end five large struc
:. tural steel buildings are being erected.
These will include the engine-room, con
verter, blast furnaces, machine.- shop,
foundry, boiler-room and biacksmith
". shop. Tfce converter building will be 225
feet long, and the foundry, boiler and
blacksmith departments will occupy a
â  building 160 feet lone.
"The explorations in the mine are going
. .on all the time, so that we are always
.keeping reserves of ore. About 600 men
â  are now employed in the mine and works.
' Prices for copper are very fair. The cop
. . per business is about the only one that
has not been affected by the hard times.
"Lately I have become interested in an
other enterprise, that of manufacturing
sugar, and I am now erecting a large su
gar-beet factory. It is nt Los Alamitos,
â  nine miles west of Anaheim, in Orange
County, this State. Tne buildine and
plant will cost between $400,000
and $500,000. The Duiluing will be
of structural steel, and 260 feet
long. The machinery will be the latest
â¢ and best and all of it will be of American
manufacture. The factory will have a
capacity of 700 tons daily, and will be
completed in July, in time for the season,
which lasts lour months.
"I have made contracts for three years
for half the capacity of the works. I ex
.: pect to raise or have raised for me next
. . year 2000 acres of beets. The soil and
'. climate there are peculiarly adapted to the
,â ' production of fine beets. They average
.. about founeen tons to the acre, and there
'. is an unu.Â«uaJly iarge per cent of saccha
rine matter in them. Some of them run
..' as much as 20 per cent
"This will make the seventh beet-sugar
factory in tne United States. Ger
many has over 400 beet sugar plants,
- France has over 300 and this entire coun
try as yet but v.x. We produce in the
i United States but 15 per cent of the en
tire amount we consume. We sent $129,
/â¢. 000,000 to foreign countries last year alone
I ' for sugar. It is really, therefore, as I look
â¢, - at it, dome a good thing for this country,
. "when we put in money to establish plants
here."
PACHECO GOES TO OHIO.
~ The Ex-Governor of California Wants
."' ..' to Be Minister to Either Spain
or Mexico.
Ex-GoTernor Romualdo Pacheco is a
â  candidate for the tosition of Minister to
either Spain or Mexico. He would as a
matter of course prefer to be given an op
â ." portunity to shine in court circles of
Madrid, but should another aspirant for
that office have stronger influence on
President-elect McKinley and so secure
the Spanish embassy, the ex-Governor
â would be satisfied with a sojourn of four
years in the beautiful City of Mexico.
Mr. Pacbeco has gone to Ohio with the
object of presenting his claims in person
â  â¢ beiore McKinley at Canton. He is said to
- have taken with him strong recommenda
tions from prominent citizt-ns of Califor
â¢ . nia. Among his credentials are letters
from the Spanish-American Republican
Club of San Francisco, and from people of
Spanish descent in the southern part of
.â¢the State.
In the last camoaign ex-Governor
Pacheco took quite an active part, more
particularly in Southern California. He
was a leading member of the Spanish-
American Club, and delivered able cam
' paigu speeches before the club aÂ« well as
â before similar organizations throughout
the State. His part in the tight was
cbiefiv confined to ."tumping for McKinley
and the Republican platform.
Of the ex-Governors of California now
Jiving Mr. Pacheco enjoys the distinction
- of being the first in point of succession on
' date 01 incumbency in office. He was
Lieutenant-Governor under Nekton Booth
. and became Governor upon Mr. Booth's
election as United States Senator. S.nce
then he has been United States Minist r
to Guatemala, in which position he serves
'. with distinction. He hopes that his record
-/will have considerable influence in hid
' present mission.

Acted in Self-Defense.
The charge of assault with a deadly weapon
against William Mclntosh, who keeps a res
taurant on Howard street, was dismissed by
Judge Low yesterday. The complaining wit
ness was P.J.-Koonpy, bnt it was shown that
Rooney first assaulted, Mclntosh, and he waÂ»
ting in self-defense -.when he struck Kooney.
Mcluteifa had sev ra! reputable witnesses to
'tnuiv to nisscoa character. '
44 Yes, ft is true that he called me a crank, but not an adventuress, I would have shot him if he had
called me an adventuress," said Mrs. Keller in answer to a question by Attorney Shortridge.
CAN'T FIND ONE
"DEAR WIFE" LETTER
Mrs. Marie Viola Keller
Searched Through Her
Ten Trunks in Vain.
Declares N~w That Every One
of Them Was Taken by
Robert.
She Says Tbat She Kept the Judge
for the First Year Following
Their Marriage.
Mrs. Marie Viola Keller was to have
taken before Notary Levy yesterday after
noon the letters which she claims the late
Judge Hastings wrote to her during his
lifetime in which *he was addressed by
hiru as "My Dear Wife," "My Darling
, Wife," and other such terms of endear
ment.
Mrs. Keller appeared in Samuel M.
Shonridge's office with her attorney, Matt
I. Suhivan, promptly at 2 o'clock. Notary
Levy was there, Mr. Gise'.man was there,
the executor of Judge Hastings' will, as
well as several other persons interested in
the estate and the proceedings. But the
letters were not there.
Mrs. Keller said she had ransacked
those ten trunks and the two boxes that
were stored away in the dark, cold cellar
no less than five times without having dis
covered one solitary epistle with the
"dear wife" appellation. The lady said
she had conned over stacks and stacks of
manuscript, had dug up insurance policies
and other more or less valuable docu
ments wherein the Hastingsname figured,
but of the "dear wife" letters there were
none.
She explained this as she has explained
it before, of course, by the declaration
that Robert Hastings had "raffled" the
trunks and taken them.
The lady talked to volubly in answer to [
Mr. Sbortridge's questions, drifting away
from the subject and interjecting state
ments and opinions with regard to Robert
anil ethers, that the lawyer found great
difficulty In securing answers to the ques
tions. Much of what she said had for this
reason to be ruled out, and the notary !
called upon her to confine herself to the |
point.
Mr. Shortridge called the attention of
the witness and that of her attorney to the
language of the order of court which re
quired her to produce not only the "My
l)e..T Wife" letters, but all of the letters
addressed to her by Judge Hastings. He
asked the witness if she had any letters
from Judge Hastings. She replied that
she did nave some, but that they were
now in her attorney's safe. She did not
know whether she had any others, but
thougnt she conld find some if she had a
search warrant to go through the papers
of Robert Hastings.
Mr. Shortridge advised her that it was
her privilege to taKe out a search warrant
if she wanted to.
Mr. Sullivan said that he had one, per
haps two, letters which had been left with
him by his client, and which were sup
posed to have been written by Judj,e
Hastings.
"We want you to understand." said Mr.
Shortridge to the witness, "that on no
iuture occasion can you introduce these
letters that are called for under this order
of the court, you having Deen given full
opportunity to make a search lor them.
You will therefore take notice and bring
what letters you may have of any charac
ter from Judge Hastings on the date to
wliic this healing shall adjourn." Con
tinuing the attorney asked : "Have you a
letter referr np to a boy called 'Joe' T'
"I did have."
"Did you ever claim tbat that child be
lon ed to your sister?"
"Never."
"That was your son?"
"Yes, sir, that was my son."
"Where was ne born?"
"In what were then my rooms, at the
corner of Sixth and Mission streets. I
had an eiejjant suite of rooms on tbe cor

attended me. He is dead now, but his
wife is living. She knows all about it.
The landlady w;is an English woman. I
do not remember her name."
"How soon after the birth of tbe child
did you inform Judge Hastings about it?"
"Kight away. I kept him informed by
letter. He sent me money regularly at
tbat time. Mr. Giselrnau used to bring
me $50 every month and Judge Hastings
would give me as much as $100 at a time.

children and she would give her eyes to
hav<> a child."
"When did the child die?"
"In March or April, 1884"
Mr. Shortridge showed the witness a'
paper addressed "To Whom It May Con
cern." the handwriting of which she iden
tified as her own. Tbe letter stated that
she, Mrs. Keller, had stood as godmother
to a boy wi o was named after her father,
and tbnt she had also taken care of a
dozen other children. The witness ex
plained tnat this letter was written as a
mere blind to "Bob." Bob. she said, had
seen heron the street in company with a
child; he had been prying into her af
fairs; he was very jealous concerning pos
sible heirs to his father's estate, and this
little paper was designed to disarm him.
She was afraid that Robert would spirit
the child away if he believed it to be a real
heir. She had to move about with the
child a great deal to protect him from
such a mischance.
The witness stated that Judge Hastings
had become paralyzed in 1882; she had
ceased to receive letters from him in 1885.
Previous to that time, however, the cor
respondence, she said, had been very pro
lific, she having written him a letter dur
ing a long period nearly every day. She
declared that 300 of them had been stolen
from tUe Judge's safe in Lakeport.
Mr. Shortridge bepan to question the
witness further concerning the letter
which she nad, in anger, torn the letter
head ana signature from, burning the rest.
This letter she insisted came from Robert,
although she would not say tbat Judge
I Hastings' name was not signed to it. She
I tore off the signature, she said, in order
j that she mieht compare it with the known j
signatures of Judge Hastings.
The letter referred to formally denied
i any marital relations between Mrs. Keller
and Judge Hastings, or any promise of
marriage, and wnile acknowledging the
receipt of a large number of letters breath
ing love declared thai the feeling was not
reciprocated. She said she received a
number of such ugly letters, but she was
ceriÂ»in ihey all cams from Robert.
"Did you Â«"ver mention to anybody be
fore Judge Hastings' death that you were
his wife?"
"Yes, to a hundred people, but not
until after he attempted to repudiate me.
At first we undertook to keep it a secret,
but when Robert oe?an to persecute us, so
that we were compelled to move from
place to place, the JudLe introduced me
10 the landladies as his wife. I was thus
introduced to a great number of lodging
house keepers."
"How did Robert cause all that?"
"Well, he would frequent the same place
with dissolute women" until we w re com
pelled to leave. I would go away for a
week somet.mes and then return to my
former lodgings, or I wou'd move away
and he would foilow us to the new lodg
ings. Sometimes he would get people to
go into my rooms and put croton oil into
my food. But I kept house on Mason
street. No. 503, for lour years."
"Did Judge Hastings always pay you
money subsequent to your marriage?"
"There was no paying about it. He
gave me money, but for the first year sub
sequent to tbe marriage I may say that I
kept him. He lived at my house without
paying rent or board and I had his wash
ing oone."
"You were married twice, you say?
What were the dales? '
"The first time was 1877; the second in
1879."
The hearing was here adjourned until
Wednesday next, when ihe letters, of any
kind whatever, from Judge Ha-tings to
Mrs. Keller must be produced or kept
out of the case.
WHILE THEY LAST.
Those Who Act Promptly Can Still Se
cure One of Those Special Ency
clopaedic Dictionary Sets.
The Pacific Coast Newspaper Syndicate,
which lately distributed among readers
many thousands of sets of the above great
work at a very low introductory price, are
now closing out at a merely nominal figure
a few of these sets which have become
slightly marred in the course of the distr.
butioo.
In packing, unpacking and handling, (he
covers of some of the volumes have been
rubbed a lilt. câ so little, indeed, that few
purchasers, even at the regular price ot
$42 to $70, would be able to discover any
cause lor complaint either regarding ap
pearance or condition.
As a matter of fact these special sets are
just as good as new for all practical pur
poses, and would compare favorably with
any absolutely perfect $42 to $70 set that
bÂ«d seen n few days' usage at home,
library or office.
The price which the syndicate has ar
ranged lor "ne of these special sets is
surely attractive to any one earnestly de
siring to own a strictly high-class refer
ence work at a trifling cost.
The four volumes are sent to any address
on payment of only $1, and if on examina
tion they are not satisfactory they can be
returned within a week, which is allowed
for examination, and tbe money will be
refunded; or if the work is retained the
small balance is payable in easy monthly
amounts.
This is certainly a rare opportunity for
any person lo whom the former iow intro
ductory price may have seemed too hiL'h.
But the number of the-e snecial sets is
naturally limitd'i, and application should
be made at once to syndicate headquarters,
14 Sansome street.
Any out-of-town reader can, of course,
apply by letter with the remittance of $1,
and one of the sets will be reserved.
HAS COME TO SPEND
$50,000 FOR CARS
A. de Cima of Mazatlan to
Build an Electric
Railroad.
He Will Also Increase His
Telephone and Lighting
Systems.
A Former Student of Santa Clara
Now United S ales Consul â Activ
ity in Mexican Mines.
Arthur de Cima, United States Consul
for four years past at Mazatlan, arrived
here yesterday on the steamer San Jose,
accompanied by Mrs. de Cima, and is at
tbe Occidental.
Consul de Cima was born in San Fran
cisco and educated at Santa Clara College.
After his graduation he was in Europe for
a time and then went to Mazatlan to look
after the large interests of bis father. It
is thus that he has remained there ever
since.
He is the owner of the electric-light
plant and telephone system in Mazatlan.
His electric plant has a capacity of 1500
liu'hts, but aa many more are needed, and
he will make arrangements for extra
electric supplies while here. He will also
get extra supp'ies for hi? telephone sys
tem. There are 100 telephones in the sys
tem now, but more are required.
However, important as this may be, he
has a far more important object in com
ing. He has a franchise for putting in an
electric streetcar system in Mazatlan and
has come here to get about $50,000 worth
of cars, rails and other apparatus.
"I will need six passenger cars and
twelve freight cars," said Mr. de Cima.
"The idea is to transfer freight from the
wharf, and from one part of the city to the
other on these cars. The business men
have agreed to support the project. I
think I will get a subsidy from the Gov
ernment too for putting in the system.
The matter is under way now, but I could
not wait as in matters of this kind things
move a little slow.
"Estimates had been received by me
from different firms in Caliiornia on the
cars and electric supplies before I left
Mazatlan, and I went over them all very
carefully. But ihere was a good many
things that need inquiring into in person,
before a contract of this kind is let, so I
came up.
"The whole of the $50,000 will be spent
here. That is the intention. N.S.Ameri
can, my electrician, came up with me. He
is well known here and was at one time
electrician at the Baldwin Hotel. Besides
these cars and the various apparatus I
will take back an engineer with me.
"At Mazatlan now things are a little
quiet, but there is a Rood deal of activity
in the gold mines of Rosario, fifty-nine
miles east of Mazatlan, which is reached
by stage. That is where nearly all the
Americans go who come to Mazatlan. The
Ban Jose Ue Gracia gold mine, north of
Mazatlan, is employing large forces of
men. It is a very big and rich mine."
Consul de Cima will be in the City about
a moQuh.

SELF-DESTRUCTION
HIS CONFESSION
Fung Ah Get Commits Sui
cide in the City
Prison.
He Is Found Suspended by His
Queue From the Bars of
His Cell.
Accused of the Murder of Lee Ah Mcc,
a Waiter, ou October 5
Last.
Fang Ah Get. a Chinese laundryman,
accused of murder, hanged himsef in his
cell in the City Prison early yesterday
morning, which put an effectual stop to
the proceedings against him.
Fung Ah Get occupied ceil 27 and at 10
minutes past 2 o'clocK yesterday morn
ing Sergeant Bidwell in making his
rounds of the cells spoke to him. Twenty
five minutes later the sergeant had oc
casion to pass cell 27 and was startled at
seeing the prisoner hanging from the bars
of his cell and in an apparently dying
condition. He had twisted his queue
round one of the bars just above the
crossbar and had then tied it firmly round
his neck. To enable him to do this he
stood upon a form, which he kicked from
under him, leaving him suspended by the
neck.
In an instant the sergeant had cut Fung
Ah Get down and finding that bis heart
was beating feebly he telephoned to ibe
Receiving Hospital for a doctor. Dr.
Thompson quickly responded, but found
that life was extinct. Later the Dody
was removed to the Morgue.
Fung Ah Get was arrested on October
20 by Sergeant Wollweber and Policeman
T. R. Flinn for tbe murder of Lee Ah Mcc
on October 5 last at the iodging-house,
840 Washington street.
Lee Ah Mcc was a waiter in the Yet
Ting How restaurant, 810 Clay street. He
was in the habit oi taking a meal every
night to the occupant of room 93
in the building. He was descending
the stairway, carrying the dishes with
him, when he was shot, as the broken
dishes were lying around him when he
was discovered in a pool of blood on the
second landing.
The bullet struck him in tbe neck
and had taken an upward course, aevarii.g
the jueular. The assassin concealed him
self in the narrow hallway at the sec
ond landing, ar.d had fired at Lee Ah Mcc
when at close range.
Sam Lock and his friend, Wong Ah
Jung, were in the building at the time
looking for work, and saw the assassin
lire tne fatal shot. Becoming frightened
they hurriedly left the scene, but later in
tbe evening reported to the police what
they had witnessed, giving the name of
the murderer and describing how the deed
hud been committed.
No trace of the murderer was found till
October 20, when Wong Ah Jans pointed
out Fans Ah Get to Serpeant Wollweber
an.l Podceman Finn, and he was arrested
and cuarged with the murder. Wong Ah
Juug claimed to have seen the shooting
and so testified in court.
Fung Ah Get was a member of a high
binder society called the Bo Leong Tong.
His society had a feud agaidst the Bo On:Â»
Tong, of which Lee An Mcc was a member.
Tne murderer received $500 to avenge
bis society and he picked out Lee Ah Mcc,
a harmless waiter, as his victim.
Alter committing the murder he went
about Chinatown spending his ill-gotten
money in carousing and gambling, and
was captured.
The case was assigned to Judge Camp
bell's court, and the friends of the mur
dered Chinaman employed Attorney John
E. Richards as special prosecutor, the
prisoner being represented by Attorney
Arthur Mack.
The attorney for the murderer asked
for and received a number of continuances,
the obvious purpose being to allow the
murderer's friends to put the eye-wit
nesses out of the way. In this they suc
ceeded, as it was with great trouble that
the prosecution was able to locate the
second eye-witness.
The case came up on Friday last and
the prosecution asked tor a bench warrant
to bring the reluctant witness into court.
A continuance was then taken until Mon
day.
There is no doubt that the murderer,
seeing that the meshes of the law were
being drawn closer and closer around him
and seeing no escape from the hangman,
became discouraged and committed
suicide.

and Other Reforms Considered by

Gold Tempts Mrs. A G Phillips
to Waive Her Marital
Standing.
By Having Herself Declared a Mil.
lionaire's Wife the Woman
Invites Bigamy Charges.
Still further complications have ariÂ«en
in the romantic suit of Mrs. A. G. Phil
lips for a divorce from her truant hus
band, who deserted her and her children
when a poor man and returned from the
African geld mines a few months ago a
millionaire.
As slated in TnE Call yesterday Mrs.
Phillips rot a divorce four years ago. but
her attorney failed to have the decree en
tered and omitted to file the findings, jo
that the divorce is in fact a nullity, and
Judge tieaw e:l has so declared in deciding
on a motion to vacate it
The foregoing facts have been greatly
harassing the husband, who had hoped
tfie old judgment was ;il! light, because, it
is rumored, he is very anxious to marry
again at his present home in Wisconsin.
New facts, however, came to light yester
day, and they put the wife in a worse
position than she appeared to be by tbe
story us told by her attorney. While
standing up for the validity of the mar
riage, or rather, while denying the bin<t
inc force of the judgment for divorce, the
wife places herself in a bad position, be
| cause she originally recognized the bind
ing lorce of the judgment, considered her
self free and married again.
It is understood that Attorney W. H. H.
Hart will contend that the divorce was in
every particular legal and that the decree
can be entered now under what lawyers
term a rule of "nunc pro tune" âan order
made now for then.
The case promises to present many
novel features before tha final heanntr.
The divorced husband's millions have
proved luring enough to the wife to in
duce her, though married again, to have
her prior divorce set aside. It is among
the possibilities that the woman may yet
be prosecuted for bigamy.

ZAMAR II TOOK
A RICH PRIZE
A Swerve Enabled Him to
Beat Howard S for the
Mumm Stake.
Chartreuse II Nosed Out Ruinart
and Made a New Track
Record.
Grady Galloped in Winner at 50 to I.
Capt. Rees Proved the Best of the
Jumpers â Preston Again.
Some people are born with a silver spoon
in their dainty mouths, while others are
compelled to travel through the various
walks of life and eat soup with a pewter
fork having but one tine. "Curly"
Shields, owner of the cracking good colt
Howard S, should now have the $1000
check that went to the winner of the G. H.
Mumm & Co. stake for two-year-olds in.
his inside pocket, but a humping match
fifty yards from the finish deprived him of
this rich plum. Zamar II had his number
.hoisted, and the St. Louis tnrfman, Dan
Honig, can congratulate himself that his
luck has returned.
The event in particular was the ieature
of the card at Ingleside yesterday and
attracted a big crowd of racegoers. The
distance was six furlongs, and thirteen of
the best two-year-olds in training picked
up their entitled weights. In the betting
Howard S, with Willie Martin in the sad
tile, and the Burns & Waterhouse stable's
Candelaria and Casper vied for favorit
ism, either being neld at odds of 2 to 1.
Of the other starters Aquinas. True
Blue and The Roman commanded scat
tering support. At the post Havey lost
little time, sending them away to a pretty
start with the gate, Howard S being the
first to break ground. Zamar 11. with H.
Martin up, seemed to possess the speed of
the party and almost immediately went to
tbe front, followed by True Blue and The
Sinner. The latter did not hold his po
sition long, giving way to Casper. Swing
ing into the stretch Zamar II was leading
by two lengths, True Biue's head in front i
of Casper and Howard S back in tbe ruck.
Martin on the Whistlejacket colt and j
6haw astride Bernardillo began moving
about the same time, and at the paddocK
had H. Martin riding the leader, Zamar
11. As Howard S with Bernardillo at his
side was making rapid strides to the front
Zamar ll swerved or was pulled over to
ward the rail by his rider, interfering with
the two contending horses and marring
what would have been a merry finish.
This interference enabled Honig's gelding
to win by half a length, with Howard S a
neck before Bernardillo. Time 1:15. The
winner was at one time 15 to 1 in the bet
tin sr.'
The bookmakers had a very busy aay of

book and probably more coin was wa

season opened. The favorites had an off

supporters by getting back to the wire ia

The weather was cloudy and at one

down a most ordinary lot. She was backed
down o even money to carry off the puise
offered for the opening seven-furlong race,
decided under celling conditions, but
could finish no better than third. Trap
pean, a 7 to 1 shot, won easily at the end
from Bombnz?tte.
The idea of Geyser, a two-year-old dele
gated to carry 98 pounds in the mile
handicap, beatinur Chartreuse II with 85
pounds utÂ» and Ruinart in at 96. looked
preposterous, though Mr. Corrigan's
youngster was made an 8 to 5 favorite.
The latter horses were tae fancy of the
handicappers and 4 to 1 was obtainable
apainst either.
Ruinart was unfortunate in being cut
off at the first turn, but soon getting
through the bunch set hot after Char
treuse and Sir Play. Passing the latter in
the stretch he looked to have the chestnut
mare beaten at the paddocx, but she re
sponded again thirty yards from the tape
and got the decision by a nose in 1:40^.
The mile and a half hurdle handicap
resulted in the lirst two horses finishing
as ihey had been played in the betting.
Captain Kees, with 8 to 5 about him,
passed the second choice, Baby Bill, less
than a furlong from the stand, winning in
a drive by a head. Hello was third, fif
teen lengths away.
Pat Dunne's Preston made it four
st-raight in the last, a six-furlong selling
sprint. He was a4to 5 choice and won
easily from Caesarian in 1:14)^.
Notes.
The win of Trappean did not prove a
very profitable one for his owner. The
last time out the borse was ridden by
Davison, who wore no spurs. Mclntyre
had the mount yesterday and with spurs
won easily. Lobsters are expensive out of
season.
Shaw, who rode Bernardillo, made a
vigorous protest at tho fouling done by
Zamar 11, but Willie Martin was most un
concerned. Martin piloted Howard S. but
as his old friend, Dan Honig. won the
stakes he evidently did not care to make a
strong kick. Had "Curly" Shields,
owner of Howard S., ridden Enos as he has
done in the past, the stake might have
been his, as he could not have scrambled
the eugs much worse than the Eastern
crack.
If Woodchopper had been ridden with
rubber reins yesterday he would have been
at the wire when the others struck the
stretch. The horse hsd speed enough to
run over the top of his field, running un
der double wraps all the way. There must
certainly have' been a little dust on the
official glasses in the judges' stand.
Horsemen have seen Taw rides and rides
that went for "RilÂ«y," but this one should
receive favorable mention from Congress
wtien that body meets.
It's on Riley Grannan again this winter.
The Kentucky plunger, tired of tearing up
losing tickets, will take a trip to Coronado
Beach next week. He is many thousands
to the bad, and the Sharkey- Fitzsimmons
match did not swell his bank account to
any noticeable extent.

RAUER CUTS IN.
The Collector Wants to Qet Hold of
the Famous Check.
The legal cloud which overhangs the
financial end of the big tight grows darker
every day, and a new element that vastly
complicates matters has been interjected.
When J. J. Raver, the collector, prepared
to swoop down on the purse, which mo-t
people thought would go to Fitzsimraons
to satisfy n judgment obtained by Jimmy
Carroll, he knew of nothing that would
tanele him up with Danny Lynch.
Now it look* as if Raver will eventually
get possession of the precious bit of paper,
and that it will coat, some one a pot of
money to recover it.
When Fitzsimmons was robbed of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
tangible fruits of his victory Raver was
disconsolate. Fitz is known to be far from
opulent, and the $904 claimed by Carroll
seemed tar away. Yesterday, however,
the collector was all smiles, for he was in
receipt of new information.
After the fight he received a letter from
G. W. Venable of New York, to whom
Lynch is indebted in the sum of $1402 on
an old judgment.
"Collect if yon can," wired Venable.
"I'll try hard," answered Kauer, and he
tried.
The first move was to place a garnish
ment on Sharkey for any interest he
might have in the check, and then to serve
theAnglo-Caiifornian Bank with a garnish
ment on anything Lynch might have
there in the way of an interest in the tied
up money. Next information as to
Lynch's possessions must be got out of
the manager. So the case against Fitz in
which Lynch was called as a witness was
pressed.
Lynch came and was asked about the
check. He toid of Dowdelle, who is asso
ciated with him in the bookmuking busi
ness, having possession of it. A garnish
ment was at once prer^ared for Dowdelle.
Unsuspicious Danny went on to tell that
he owned horses, which he named as fol
lows: Mr Jingle, Volt. Robin Hood, Con
tribution, Ross, Charlie T, Riot and eight
maiden three-year-olds.
Of course, this was good news to Raver,
and Lynch was pressed to tell more of his
belongings, but he became suspicious and
would not acknowledge being any richer.
Tbe attorneys had enough, however, and
Fitz was not called upon to relate that he
was poor and unable to pay.
Lynch's horses will be attached and the
check closely watched, and there appears
to be trouble iv store for the astute man
ager.
As the matter stands there are three
aspirants, Raver, Fitz and Sharkey, for
the possession of that precious certificate.
If Raver gains possession or even ties it
up he will bÂ« in a position to dictate terms
to all, for if Fitz wins his case in court he
will have to pay Carroll's $904, and if
Sharkey wins, Lynch's debt of $1402 to
Venable will likely be paid, particularly
as Raver claims to be able to prove that
Lynch is interested in the certificate.
NO MORE FIGHT PERMITS.
Public Indignation Has Its Effect
Upon the Super
visors.
It is likely that no more boxing contests
will be had in thu City for some time to
come. The effect of the aroused public
sentiment over the manner in which Fitz
simmons was robbed has not failed to
make itself felt on the Supervisors.
"The matter has not yet been dis
cussed," said Supervisor Dimond last
night, "except privately, by the various
members of the board. For essential
reasons the last meeting of the License
and Order Committee was very brief and
the matter failed to come up.
"My private opinion is tnat the public
feeling in the matter has not failed of
effect, and that this board will not grant
any more permits for boxing contests in
this City and County.
"Only one permit is now out â that for

TTOXJ C-AJ>T BE CURED.
Lay Aside Prejudice Caused by the Failure of Quackeryâ Listen to the
Words of Praise Uttered by These Prominent Men, and Be Just to
Yourselfâ Try Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
It is pitiable to think of the vast number of men who go on from day to day suffering
mental and physical torture as a result of their weakness, while right at their doors other men
are being cured of the same disease. One who has not known it himself cannot realize the feel-
ings of the man- in an advanced stage of Nervous Debility, nor does he hear of it, for these men
do not talk of their troubles. Even when they are fortunately led to use the remedy which is
now so well known â Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt â and are cured by it, they do not mention it to
their closest friends ; hence the prevalence of this trouble and the means of cure are appreciated
only by those who have had experience.
Considering these points, it is worth while to note how many men throw aside all feelings
of delicacy and give to the world, for the benefit of fellow-sufferers, the fact of their cure by Dr
Sanden's Electric Belt.
"The Belt which I bought of you six months ago has entirely cured me of Nervous Debil-
ity, and I feel better than I ever have in my life, as it has made a new man of me. I will gladly
recommend your Belt, as it surely does all you claim for it," writes Paul Watterstein, Visalia
Cal., Nov. 24, 1896.
Mr. L. L. Jaccard, one of the best known and most respected mcii in Alameda County, in
the jewelry business at San Leandro, was cured by Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt over a year a<* o.
Last week he said :"I have no delicacy in making this statement. Your Belt has cured me of a
varicocele and weakness that has been slowly destroying me for twenty-six years, and now that I
am cured I think it is no more than right to tell the'rest of the poor sufferers of it. A thing that
is really good ought to be spoken of." Mr. Jaccard is now one of the best specimens of physical
manhood in Alameda County. He is 50 years of age, 5 feet 9 inches in height, weighs 210 pounds
and does not carry an ounce of superfluous flesh. His form is a mass of muscle.
Strength of manhood is not dependent upon flesh. Fat men are seldom vigorous. This
strength is in the nerves, and the life is electricity. This explains the reason for the inevitable
failure of drugs and the success of Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt in restoring the lost power.
Applied for three to six hours in the twenty-four, at any time during the day or night that
is most convenient to the patient, it saturates the system with Electric energy (animal magnet-
ism), and this energy slowly builds up the forces of all vital parts.
"I received your Belt on February 9th last and wore it for two or three hours every night
for about two months. I am cured, and my partner, Henry Mauvis, used the same Belt for vital
weakness, and it has cured him," says Julius Jahn, Silver Star, Montana.
No remedy is so easy to use as Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt. None gives such quick results.
It has a patented regulator, which enables the wearer to turn the current on mild or strong at
will while the Belt is on the body. It is warranted to last and give a strong Electric current for
one year. It is by all means the surest cure for any weakness.
Young, middle-aged and old men should send for Dr. Sanden's famous work, "Three
Classes of Men," which will be sent, closely sealed, without marks, free. It gives full information
and hundreds of letters from people cure*d. It may save you a great deal of suffering. Get it.

amounting to nearly $30,000, were paid off

winners presented themselves. There
were two or three oral protests, the loud

CEMETERY THREATENED.
A Movement on Foot to Cut
Sutter Street Through
Laurel Hill.
Those Who Have Lots in the Bury
ing Ground Are Strongly
Opposed to the Measure.
A lively legal battle is on foot over an
attempt that is being made to induce the
Board of Supervisors to order Sutter
street cut through Laurel Hill Cemetery.
The Richmond Improvement Club is at
the head of the movement, and it is op
posed by a large number of wealthy and
influential people who own lots in the
burial ground.
The improvement club claims that the
opening of the street is of vital importance
to the interests of that section of the City
and will ask the Street Committee of the
board to consider the matter at its meet
ing Thursday next.
Henry P. yonntag, who is a trustee of
the Laurel Hill Cemetery Association,
suras up the position of the opposition as
follows:
The question is one of vital importance to
a large number oi people and should be very
carefully considered before Rny action is taken.
The opening of a street through the cemetery
would work a very great hardship upon
vast interests, Tne strip of land which it
is proposed to condemn contains the
monuments of some of San Francisco's
most noted citizens, and the financial
output represents millions of dollars. Indeed,
the strip is known as "Senators' row," for there
are to be lound the tombs ot Senators Fair,
Broderick, Sargent, Gwin and others, while
Leautiful Mr-.ictures in commemoration of the
dead have been erected by the Flood estate,
by the relatives of Dr. Cooper, Milton S.
Latham, Loring Pickering and many others I
could name.
At the point spoken of the grade is very
steep iv the cemetery, and in order to bring it
down to the level of the street, as it is at pres
ent, a deep cut would have to be made. This
would virtually destroy the whole cemetery.
As may readily be seen, the damage resulting
would be much'greater than any benefits re
sulting from the proposed opening of the
street.
Furthermore, the rules of the cemetery asso
ciation, as prepared in conformity with an act
of tne Legislature, and embodied in the deed
to the land, declare that no lot can be sold in
the cemetery for any other purpose than the
interment of the dead. I woula consider it
needless desecration to make the proposed cut.

year. It was expected that there would
be a big contest over the presidency be
tween A. P. Swain of the Acme Club and
A. W. W^lie of the San Francbco Club,
but Mr. Wehe's name was withdrawn at
the last moment and Mr. Swain was unan
imously elected. The other officers elected
were F. T. Dwyer of Sacramento, first
vice-president; G. G. Taylor of Mountain
View, second vice-president; J. F. Han
cock of San Francisco, secretary-treasurer,
there being no opposition to any of these
nominations.
The newly elected officers took their
seat?, and after considerable routine busi
ness the meeting adjourned to meet two
months hence.
Sacramento's Police Case.
The somewhat complicated case of Warren
F. Drew against John B. Rodgers will be re
heard by the Supreme Court, the order having
been made yesterday. This is the case in
which the rival claims of Drew and Rodgers
to the office of Chief of Police of Sacramento
during a certain period, some years ago, were
involved. The contention now is practically
to determine who was entitled to the salary.

George E. Martin Comes Here to Get
' . ' Capital to Search â Expeditions
â¢ That Failed.
The mystery of the fabulously rich
guano island off the coast of Central
America, for which many expeditions
have searched in vain, bids fair to be
â  cleared up at last and in a most romantic
manner.
On Monday last a quiet-looking young
fellow", about 2S years old, registered at an
uptown hotel as George E. Martin from
Boston, and after inquiring the address of
a number of men prominent in maritime
cir.cles, departed to iook for them. The
game evening he paid his bill and left,
stating that he was going to Oakland to
stop for a few days.
From a gentleman with whom Martin
became acquainted while on tne journey
from Boston to this City it was learned
that Martin is a nephew of Captain Mar
tin, the original discoverer of the island,
a.nd that he is bent on making a voyage
to it.
Martin said that his uncle while on his
way from Apia to this City many years
ago in command of a schooner was blown
aut. of his course by a gale, and while
getting back to it sighted a low island.
He drst supposed tnat it was Clipperton
Island, which is not so much out of the
line of vessels plying between Samoa and
San Francisco, but boon saw that he was
mistaken.
. The high point of rock that distin
guishes Ulipperton was missing, and to
satisfy his curiosity Captain Martin sailed
clo.se in to the island. He ? oon discovered
that the island was an atol, and that it
was enormously rich in the phosphates
- that- bring such rich remuneration to those
whro can land them in sufficient quantities
â <yn American soil.
â¢ Provisions and water were running short
and Captain Martin continued on his voy
age after taking observations to show the
1 L'rition of the island, intending 10 return
and make his fortune out of the valuable
' d-eposits.
â¢ -Ttiis information was conveyed 1o his
relative's in Boston in a letter which ac
companied a bulky package of papers
whiCQ the old mariner asked them to keep
, until he shouid send for them. The pa
pers were carefully put away, as he re
quested, and eventually iorgotten, as
nothing was ever heard of him again. It
was supposed he had gone in search of the
island and had been lost at sea.
Martin was taken sick with typhoid
fever alter reaching San Francisco, as the
result-of the privations he had endured,
atii.was sent to the hospital, where he re
mained for several months. When be
wa'a finally able to get about his mind was
itir., aired and he was totaliy unabie to re
iiiember what had become of his private
.jmpers*, and though he called on every
'â¢friend he iiad in the City and 'inquired if
.he had left anything witn them the docu
nJen's never turned up.
Captain Martin trieu faithfully to get
ca.pitai" to invest in a ship to search for
'tfie islaud, the location of which he was
su'fe>'h.e could find, but people took no par
tfcuiar notice of his talk, thinking him
demented. He died broken-hearted a:
â¢ noi. being able to search for nis lost island.
â  "â¢VÂ«ars afterward a Captain Burns, who
owned a schooner called -the Vine, came
: into .possession of an old chart that Cap
tain Martin had drawn from memory, and
taking stock ia the story relating to the
island, fitted out his vessel and started on
a voyage of exploration. Burns cruised
about for several months but found noth
ing and finally gave up in despair.
. 7-The map that Burn 3 relied on located
"the.island about 400 miles southwest of
Clipperton Island, which has already pro
duced a* fortune in phosphates.
â¢ .In" July last another band of adven
.turous -sailors, after looking the matter
.carefully over, concluded that they could
fin-d. the island if it was still above water
aad chartered the little schooner Moon
light of J. A. Magee and others, who con
stitute the Oceanic Phosphate Company.
' â¢' .Captain Spencer headed the parry and
alter taking aboard provisions for several
â months a cargo for Altata, Mexico,
she sailed in search of fortune. From
Altata the schooner headed for the sup
posed location of the atol, but though the
search was kept up for a month, beating
backward and forward across the trackless
waste, nothing more than the pinnacle of
Clipperton broke the monotony of the
trip.
Provisions were looked over on the for
tieth day out aud, concluding that it was
useless to risk starvation, the party re
luctantly turned the vessel's prow toward
San Francisco and reached here in Octo
ber, dbheartenert and out of time and
pocket. The chart on which this party
relied is supposed to be the same one tnat
sent Captain Burns on his long and fruit
less voyage.
Now comes the strangest part of the
story, where it is taken up by the man
who arrived here on Monday.
.Long accounts of the Moonlight trip
were published in the San Francisco pa
pers and the Eastern press copied the
tale. A New York paper fell into the
hands of Martin and brought to his mind
ajbun,dle of old, musty papers, charts,
etc., that he had been examining a few
years, before.
They had struck him as curious, but he
.had. regarded them as valueless aud had
contemplated destroying them.
He instituted inquiry among his rela
tives and learned the story ot how they
liad reached Boston and at once concluded
that he had iound his uncle's original pa
pers.-. Their presence in the Boston home
he accounted for on the idea that when
Captain Martin tirst fell sick he concluded
that such valuable papers had better be in
the safe keeping of hi* relatives and that
he could s?nd for them when he recov
ered, if that was to be bis fortune.
When recovery came his mind was gone
a"* far as the papers were concerned, and
tb'ey had remained unnoticed for many
years.
'. Young Martin decided that he would
make an attempt to find the island, and is
here to see whether he can find ao;ne one
to take the matter in band and put in the
neqeSsary capital.
Regarding his charts Martin has very
little to say. except that he hÂ«s positive
evidence that they ara the original?, and
that if the fruitless expeditions went in
tte direction reported they were wrong.
He says that they were hundreds of miles
off -the right track, bat refuses to say in
which direction.
A captain-owner in Oakland is inresti
rating the story told by Martin, and if
convinced of its worth will soon take nis
Vessel to the south seas.

HAMEL LOSES.
Margaret Hnckmaitcr't "Love and Af
fection" Deed la Ordered Canceled.
Judge Seawell has eivÂ«m judgment for
the plaintiff in the case of Joan C. Buck
master against Joseph Hamel. The suit
was to recover possession of real estate on
Eighteenth street, near Mission, that was
deeded to Hamel by the late Margaret
Buckmaster, the consideration mentioned
being "love and nffection."
The complaint alleged that Hamel ex
ercised undue influence over the mind of
Miss liuckmaster and made her believe
that her relatives had no regard lor her.
Hamel's answer was that he and Miss
Buckmaster liad agreed to reside togeth er
as brother and sister and that they had
borne that relationship for several years
in an honorable way, the agreement being
that each should deed to the other the
property which they owned, the survivor
to take it all.
The conn while not finding adversely to
this statement decided that the circum

ROASTED THE EXAMINER.
Captain Ransome Complains oi
Unfair Treatment of But
terworth.
Bath Varsity Teams Dined by the
University Club Last Nighlâ New
Baseball Trophy.
The Varsity football players of Stanford
ana California were dined last night by
the University Club in the club's building
on Setter street.
The victors of the great Thanksgiving
came were indistinguishable from the
vanquished, as all in fuil evening dress
sat promiscuously about the banquet
board and forgot their rivalry and resent
ment and remembered only that they were
fellow university students among neutral
friends, whose own happy college days
were but memories of the past.
At the conclusion of an elaborate menu
of many courses speeches were made by
the two captains and by several of the
hosts.
Big Captain Fickert of the Stanford
team in the course of a brief little speech
thanked the University Club for bringing
about such a pleasant union of the two
universities.
Captain Ransoroe of California spoke
more at length. He took the opportunity
to make a defense of Coach Butterworth
and remarked tint he is all right. Then
he went vigorously into a roast of the Ex
aminer for what he styled its unfair treat
ment of Butterworth after his departure
for the East.
He Dad, be asserted, gone to the Exam
iner in an attempt to have that paper do
the fair thing and square the derogatory
and unwarrantable impression created in
the public mind by articles seriously re
flecting upon the coach and his relations
with Ransome, but to no purpose. The
paper would nave none of it. Going
further into the attitude of the press,
Ransome declared that none of the pub
lishecl newspaper explanations for Cali
fornia's defeat had emanated from any
one of the players. They had no explana
tion ; they were fairly outplayed.
Proiessor Bacon of Berkeley made the
humorous speech of tlie evenine.
Trustee Taylor of Stanford University
made some happy verbal hits himself in a
speech laudatory of football aa a manly
game.
The following were seated at table:
From Stanford there were Captain Fickert,
Cottou, Fisher, Searight, Carle, Jack Rice, Ray
Smith, Football Manager Dave Brown, Pro
lessor Campbell and Professor Allerdice.
From Berkeleyâ Captain Ransome, Hall,
Snerman, Kennedy, Carr, Simpson, Ludiow,
KcNott, Arkley, Jimmio Hopper, Instructor
and Assistant Coach Nott, Professor Bacon,
Professor Edwards, Proiessor Clapp and Pro
fessor Haskell.
The University Club has decided to of
fer a fine silver trophy cup to be competed
for by the Varsity baseball teams. Am
ple funds for the cup have already been
subscribed. It will be competed for by
Stanford and California and will become
the property of whichever baseball team
shall win two of the three annual Varsity
games two years in succession.
Better Lighting Is at Haiirt.
The Merchants' Association has received so
much encouragement from the property,
owners and tenants in its efforts for the better
lighting of the City that orders h*ve already
been given for erecting arc lights of 2000
candle-power along Kearny street, from Market
to California, and on Post. Geary, Sutter and
Bush streets, between Grant avenue and
Kearny. It is expected that in the course of a
few days the lights will be in operation and
all these blc.cks highly illuminated. The asso
ciation is also co-operating with the merchants
and property-owners on Fillmore aud Third,
Fourth ana Sixth streets for electric lights
upon these thoroughfares.
Last Night's Alarm*.
An alarm was sounded from box 146 at
5:45 o'clock last evening for v blaze in the
rear of J. H. Boyson's drugstore, Twenty-first
and Va encia sireets. The fire, which was
caused by the careless handling of matches,
damaged'the building to the extent of $50.
The alarm from box 532 at 8 :30 p. m. was for
a fire in a cooper-shop connected with the
South San Francisco Packing Company's build
ing, Sixth avenue and M street. The damage
will amount to about .fIOO.

Joseph Dornate was arrested on Friday for
cruelty to a horse Dy Officer McCurrie of ttie

not pull a heavy load to Ms satisfaction.
Reflection* of a Bachelor.
A woman Knows a good thing when she
doesn't see it.
The homeliest girl in the world will be
lieve you when you tell her that she has
line eyes.
As soon as a girl has been to Europe she
stops talking about Indian summer and
calls it "I'.alion weather."
A woman likes to put her nrm around a
man because it 3eerns as though she was
protecting him from something.
If cvory young man could be made to
put up one stove with his girl to boss the
job there would be ;otÂ« more bachelors.
If a man was struck by lightning in his
own house on a clear day his wife would
say it was just because be didn't take care
of himself.â New York Free Psess.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1596.
A MERRY WAR
AMONG THE ELKS
Lodge Number Three Re
sents Slurs Against a
High Officer.
A Suit by Golden Gate Lodge
Stirs Up Some Unfrater
nal Feelings.
J lines P. Dunne and Others Speak in
Def.nse of Grand Exalted Ruii-rJ
Detweiler.
The legal contest between Golden Gate
Lodge No. 6, B. P. O. Elks, ana its succes
sor, San Francisco Lodge No. 3, promises
to be waged with great bitterness in the
courts and to result in the development of
feelings quite unfraternal.
The members of the new order feel very
bad because Grand Exalted Ruler Meacle
D. Detweiler of Harrisburg, Pa., who came
here to settle matters,Jaas not been treated
with the delicacy and consideration He
deserves by those who siill insist that
Golden Gate Lodge No. 6 is the only and
original order.
All the above came out because of the
suit of the members of the old lodge
against James P. Dunne and others to
recover $4388 49, which was turned over to
the new lodge by the officers of the old,
Grand Exalted Ruler Detweiler having
revoked the charter of the old lodge and
received the funds.
"Detweiler is not a tramp or a hungry
walking delegate, who was swayed in his
judgment by a good meal," said Mr.
Dunne yesterday, "but he is an honorable
man who stands well in his State and who
acted fairly."
Joseph Howell, one of the officers of
the old order who abandoned it for the
new, was equally indienant. Speaking of
the matter, he said; "Detweiler is a man
of m.-uisand standing, is District Attor
ney of Harrisbure, and wh.-n he came
here to adjust matters he acted equi
tably."
The whole qnestion is whether Det
weiler had authority to suspend the old
lodge, call in i;s charter and take its
funds, even with the consent of its officers.
The nght now on in the courts is whether
the fifteen or eighteen members of the old
order can hold out against the ruling and
establish their claim in the courts. Nearly
Xli of th? mcribejs of Golden Gate Lodge
No. 6â about 100 in allâ went into the new
loip^e. No. 3, but those who held out
promise to wage a merry war for the
funds. All agree, however, that Exalte!
Ruler Detweiler has been put in a false
light.

MRS. OR, F. CLARK, 420 Geary St.,
S-A.2ST FRANCISCO. CAL.
their attorney, has sued James P. Dunne,
Charles W. Nevin, Alfred Perrier, J. E.
Howell and Charles S. Hoffman for
$4888 49 on account of moneys and prop
erty belonging to said lodge which the de
fendants are accused of converting to their
own use on the 19tb of last August.
The complaint alleges that the lodge
had on deposit certain sums of money,
and that the same was unlawfully with
drawn by the defendants and converted to
their own use. It also charged that Mr.
Dunne and his co-defendants have taKen
possession of and illegally hold certain
books, records, paraphernalia, papers, pic
tures, documents, chattels and other mis
cellaneous personal property belonging to
the lodge and used it for carrying on its
business, the same being wortn $1000, and
that though the members of the lodge en
titled to possession of the property have
been diligently seeking for it during the
past thirty days they cannot get hold
of it.
The complaint is sworn to by Harry
Newboff, exalted ruler of the lodge.
Two jM-iandly Suits.
A week ago mention was made of a suit
brought by MrÂ». Lydia Krull against several of
her children for property in the Mission. Also
that the Krull family had been sued by A. J.
Wohlander and 0. Groenberg for a lot on
Howard street upon which a church, known
as Our Savior Scandinavian Evangelical Luth
eran Church, is located. The first action was
a friendly suit, simply to quiet the title to
Mrs. Krull's property, to which the children
lay no claim. The second action also is a
friendly suit brought for a similar purpose.
The late E. G. Krull was a trustee of the
church, which is not incorporated, and the
widow lays no claim to the lot. Both actions
have been decided to the satisfaction of all
parties. _

."That is 'Moo,' the noise a cow makes,
Lucy.' See, it 'ls made up of pot-hook?

learning on." .
So Lucy sat down and prepared' to copy,
"Moo." But she did it An a queer way.
She made an M at the beginning of. each
line, and followed â : each M with a whole
ring of o's all across the slate, like this,
Mooooo. â 
"Bui that isn't right, Lucy," said, the

DISAGREEMENT
OF THE JURY
Judge Hebbard Fails to
Convict T. S. Williams
of Libsl.
Attorney Foote Makes an Ex
traordinary Plea and a
Promise.
An Argument Abounding in Senti
mentâBare'ay Henley on ths
Verdict.
Twelve weary men filed into Judge
Da'ngertield's court in charge of Deputy
Sheriff Hayes at half-past 5 o'clock last
evening, and as Clerk Dunker called tho
role they answered to the following
names: John D. Robertson, Myer Cohn,
John Kiordan, Alfred Eislen, T. It. Hor
ton, Chris. M. Christopher, Joseph M.
Donlon, M. H. Gaffney, John H. Mehr
tens, Alfrtd Packsher, John Tercey, Orrin
Bailey.
These tired citizens were the juror 3in
the case of Thomas b- Williams Jr., who
was charsed with libeling J. C. B. H(?b
bard. They had been locked up for twenty
four hours.
Before calling Ihe jury into court to
ascertain their opinions* in regard to the
probability of an ntrreeruent Judge Dain
perfiel I expre-sed a desire 10 have the
deliberations of the jury prolonged for at
least another night, uut at ihe request of
the pro-eculing witness and the defendant
it was decided to have ti.e jurors in ana
hear what they Mad to
One incident wnict. led to the calling m
of the jury was reported by the bailiff.
He stated to the court that a member of
the jury had obtained possession of a
book which he persisted in reading, ignor
ing other members oi ihe jury.
Foreman Donlon informed Judge Dain
gerfieid that he thought it would be im
possible to agree, as one of their number
had refused to agree to any honorable
suggestion for settling the question.
Juror Robertson firmly objected to this
remark and the jurors were asked one by
one if they thought they could ever agree.
They all replied in the negative ami were
discharged at the request of Attorney
Kabn, representing the prosecution, and
Attorneys Baker and Costello,' represent
ing the defendant.
It is thought that Williams will not be
tried again on this charge.
Mr. Henley, speaking last night of tho
aciio:Â» of the jury in failing to acquit
Thomas S. Williams, staled that it was
due mainly to two c.iu*es, viz.:
"First, the refusal of Judge Dainger
field to admit certain material and im
portant evidence tending to estab.ish tho
justification of the libel; secondly, that
portion of Mr. Foote's speech wherein he
urged the jury to convict, saying if they
acquitted it would ruin and destroy Judge
\Heubard's future usefulness on the bench
and piace an indelible stain on his ciiar
acter, whereas if they convicted Williams
he (Foote) would see that the fine was
merely nominal.
"This extraordinary plea was twice
urged by Mr. Foote with great force and
earnestness. It was a remarkable state
ment to make to a jury.
"In other words, an acquittal won'd
ruin Hebbard and a conviction would not
harm Williams*. It is not at all strange,
that this argument produced some result,
but it is strange that counsel should lo^e
sight of justice and get far into the realms
of i-eiuiiiient.
"The public will wonder if Mr. Foote
would have been able to deliver the goods
ana eot the defendant off with a nominal
fine in case ihe jury had convicted.
"As to whether the result thus obtained
may be fairly reLarded a* a vindication o!
Judee Hebbard the public may determine
as it may elect."

:. â  Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)

â i The bridfre across San Leandro Creek
'-that was built by the electric railroad will
,&e a scene of considerable interest during
:: -tlie next few days. It is not at all unlikely
,:thjit court injunctions and armed watch
.â â ihefn will be necessary to protect the
.-bridge from being sawed asunder.
, .About tive years ago, when the electric
:r : oad built the bridge, it purchased from
.:the- owner, D^vid Moyes, several feet of
â¢â . Jiis ground as a right of way. It was nec
.'â e?9sa,ry to acquire this land so tiiat a foot-
I-.alk. could be constructed alongside the
.:ra"ck of the electric cars. Mr. Moyes was
â¢/well paid for his property and would nave
'had no grievance had not the company, as
â ii"c" alleges, taken more ground than they
â '. paid. for. He asserts that when the com
'.pany wanted to build they acquired title
'to enough land for their bridge, but not
for t-hs sidewalk, and that at th â  present
...titoe tbe sidewalk is entirely upon ii is
â  pro-periy, and also that one of the piers is
vsuok in his land. Some time ago he
.: called the attention of the company to the
â â¢alleged trespass, but the company did not
.look on his claim with any degree of
iTnerit nor accord him any satisfaction.
:â¢â  waited until nearly five years
;have passed away and cow he demands a
â¢â¢.settlement. Five years' possession of the
/land would give the company a right to it,
:Â£hd Mr. Moyes does not intend to sleep
.and .let peop c appropriate his land.
!â¢'â¢ Jt -few days ago the owner decided to
â .â fo'ebe matters to an issue. He removed a
...) o. ti.oi> of the property that is on his land
: jiiwi..tbTeatene<i to saw off the whole of the
â¢->id.ewalk if a satisfactory settlement were
\;.iKst at once feacheJ. As a result of his
V.work quite a large portion of the footwalk
â¢running alongside the track from the
::â¢. n ;rth side of tlie bridge to the center of
y the, creek has been removed, and the
".D.wher intends to treat the remainder in
'/the* same way unless his claim be satisfied.

FIGHTING, BUT FRIENDS.
Young Men Republicans Do Some Old-
Timo Politics.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. s.â The Young
Men's Kepubliean Club, which held a
very siormy election last nignt, will not
be disrupted by the two factions who were
I anxicus to elect their men for Dresident.
Although the struggle wnskeen it was not
bitter, and to-day all hands are treating
last night's scrimmage in the nature of a
good joke.
President Stetson, who was elected after
ex-President Walsh had left the chair,
may have to go through the formality of
another election if it is shown that last
night's proceedings were irregular, but if
this be the case he will certainly be re
elected, as it was proved conclusively that
his friends are largely in the majority.
Harry Pulcifer, Stetson's rival, refused
to recognize the authority of the meeting
at which Mr. Stetson was elected. But
there is no doubt that he will not push
hi" fipht under the circumstances.
President Stetson has appointed the
following executive committee: First
Ward, John Mott and Oscar Breiling;
Second, Al Williams Â°nd V. W. Condon;
Third, Marston Campbell and J. I.
Palmer; Fourth, 0. J. Mullen and O.
Tobriner; Fifth. J. Cal Ewing and F. E.

Ex-President Walsh declares that he
will meet next week with his followers
and elect officers who will in reality be the
oiiicers of the club. But it is generally
supposed tliat he will change his mind
before that time.
SUCCESS WITH TOBACCO.
San Leacdro Board of Trade
Makes an Interesting Ex
periment.
The First Crop Is Now Being Dried
and Is Pronounced to Be of
an Excellent Grade.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Dec. 5. f
After man}' experiments, the San Le
andro Board of Trade has proved the pos
sibility of raising tobacco in the vicinity
of San Leandro in sufficient quantities and
of such quality as to make its cultivation
profitable.
When this industry was first mooted a
grave trouble faced the projectors of the
movement. It was the difficulty of pro
! curing the services of a man familiar with
the raiain ; and curing of tobacco. At
length the acquaintance was made of
Charles Napier of San Francisco. He at
once examined into the conditions of soil
and climate at San Leandro, and reported
that both were favorable for the propaga
tion of the weed.
Some months ago he agreed to make a
trial and was thereupon furnished with
the necessary seed and ground.
A portion of the seed he planted on the
I ground of J. A. Gallet and a larger part on
| the Hastings place. The seed sprouted und
j the plant thrived, and indue time ripened.
The experiment was successful and now
about 300 pounds of iine looking tobacco
are undergoing the process of drying.
Mr. Napier has carefully examined it and
is conlident that it can be successfully
cured and will make an excellent grade
of tobacco. Mr. Napier is also exueri
menting at Haywards, San Jnse and Napa,
and in each case he already sees sufficient
encouragement to warrant him in saying
that the tobacco-growing industry can be
added with pronounced profit to the
other industries of this State.
EIGHTEEN BURGLARIES.
Remarkable Confession of a Boom
Ihief Caught "While at
Work.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 5 âJohn Taylor,
a well-known burglar, was cleverly cap
tured this morning by John Monroe at
the Avenue House, on San Pablo avenue.
At the police station Taylor confessed 10
eighteen lodging-house robberies in this
city within the past three months.
John Monroe, a clerk employed by Phe
lan & Fish, rooms at tbe Avenue House.
About 5:30 o'clock this morning he heard
somebody in his room, and when he
opened his eyes he saw a man inspecting
the pockets of his clothes. Monroe jumpedn ped
out of bed and grabbed the fellow around
the waist and yelled for help as loudly as
he could. There was a struggle between
the two men, but Monroe held on until
assistance came. Tne first to arrive was
Mr. Dennison, tie proprietor, and he was
quickly followed by several others. When
the burglar saw them he ceased struggling
and waited quietly until the police came.
At the police station he was recognized
as the man who served a short term in
jail some month 3 ago for stealing an um
breila. After being locked up he sent
word to Chief Lloyd from his c?ll that he
wished to make a confe-sion, and in the
pre ence of the Chief and the detectives
he admitted that he had carried out
\ eighteen burglaries this fall. He seemed
I to have a good memory, and remembered
the details o: each crane. He did not use
skeleton keys and never forced his way
into a room, always doing tiis work early
in the morning at a time when there was
sure .to be several room doors open.
According to his own statement he has
secured various parcels of booty and
money from . the Hotel Merritt, Weber
House, Newland House, Richmond Hou9e,

LEAD THE COAST
IN SELF-DENIAL
Oakland Corps of Salva
tionists Eat Bread and
Water for the Cause.
They Raise a Large Amount ot
Money and Are Helped by
Juniors.
Little Soldiers Prcvj Equal to Theii
Seniors in the Matter of
Sacr fice.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, December 5. f
The Oakland corps of the Salvation
Army, wnich enjoys the distinction of
being the first branch to be organized on
the Pacific Coast, is also the banner self
denying corps of the West. The week of
self-denial, which has just been observed
The Little Daughters of Adjutant Reid, Who Have Worked Hard to
Make the Oakland Corps the Banner Self-Denial Corps on
the Coast.
by the army, was the means of rai3in
$sob among the local soldiers.
These figures represent a vast amount,
when the various ways and means by
which it was raised are taken into con
sideration. Among the most energetic in
denying themselves for the cause of hu
manity were the little juniors, who en
tered into the spirit of the observance
with a zeal and activity to a greater ex
tent than was expected of them. The
little people alone succeeded in raising
nearly $100, many of the little tots indi
vidually handing in cards showing they
had gathered in $10.
Tho spirt of aeif-denial was practiced
alike by the child of the millionaire and
of the struggling officer. Litt:e Faith
Montgomery of Beulah, whose parenis are
the richest Salvationists in the land, did
her part, but did no moie than the chil
dren of Adjutant Reed, whose income
depends solely on the excess of the collec
tions above the running expenses of the
corp^. These collections generally need
strengthening to the amount of about $I*o
a montu in order to balance the ipdj^er.
The cadets in thÂ» garrison wlio are try
ing to become oflicers and whose bill of fare
under the most favorable, circum-tances
does not compare with ttial of a<i orvlinary
dime restaurant, found many ways by
which they could make a sacrifice and
swell the fund. Some of them denied
themselves everything that was not
absolutely necessary to sustain their
health and strength, and Adjutant Roi.il
enjoyed many sumptuous banquets of
bread and water ?o that he might be able
to save at least something for the benefit
of the many channels of philanthropic
work into which the self-denial fund Mows,
it is usual at tbe commencement oi the
week of self-denial ior the officer in charge
of a division to issue an estimate of the
various amounts that each corps may be
expected t.> raise. This estimate is always
placed sufficiently high to create a healthy
umbiiion. In the case of Oakiand it was
placed at $450, and by its activity and hp\l
sacrtnee the soldiers ol Oakland aided by
â¢their friends h;ive increased tuis sum $100.
There is considerable rivalry among the
corps of a. division regarding this tund,
but no otner corps on the coast can
present such a good showing as California

OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. s.â The malarial
odors of West Oakland are stil! pursuing 1
the Hon. John P. Irish. For many years
he ha 3 ma<ie an earnest fight to have the
nuisance abated, but up to date with little
success. He publishes a statement to-day
in which he say 3 that every objectionable
thing in town is directed toward West
Oflkland. He concludes by saying: "We
cannot sell out and go elsewhero, and
with common justice done to this part of
the city we don't want to leave it. Now
if it is asked where is the do:' pound, the
answer is West Oakland. Where is the
marsn? West Oakland. Where is the
;;artage burned? West Oakland. Where
has garbage been dumped for years? West
Oakland. \Vtiere does the mai-.i lake
s?wer empty into the bay? West Oakland.
And, pray, where is West Oakland? It is
on the best side of the peninsula, where
the pure soh wind first comes undtfiled, to
be poisoned by pestiletiyal tilth and carry
contagion and stench into every home in
the city."

OAKLAND, Cal, Dec. s.â The junior
class of '98 of the University of California
save their annual farce at the Macdonough
Theater this afternoon. This is the first
time that junior day has been celebrated
in Oakland, and the theater was packed
beyond the point of comfort.
The curtain-raiser was entitled "Seven
Years Alter," and was written by Ray
mond J. Rubs '95. The scene was a
masked ball in an old Virginia dining
room, and the parts t>f He and She, which
were takrn by Walter Starr and Miss Cen
tennia Barto, were highly amusing.
The farce was written by Walter Starr
'98, and was entitled "The Black Colt."
There was but one act, and it was very
cleverly rendered. The dramatis persoaie
iv ere:
Rev. Joshua Paynton, Will C. Russell; Dob
son Dobbard (a younpr man in search of
health). Hen Bakewell; Pete Randy (a jockey),
Billie Smith ; Mrs. Joshua Paynton, Miss Alice
Marcbebout; Mdrjqry and Elizabeth (her
daughters), Miss Centennia Barto and Miss
Agnes Kuerr; Briggs (a iconstable), John
Kainey.
Rev. Joshua Paynton (Will C. Russell),
a horseracing preacher, was rather gay for
even a modern parson, and his taste tor
horseracing was only equaled by the
knowledge he possessed of the various de
tails that go to make op what is known as
the shady side of the turf. Pete Randy
(Riliie Smith). Mrs. Joshua Paynton
(Miss Marchebout) and her daughter, Miss
Marjory (Miss Centennia Barto) were
very funny.
The musical rrograrnrde was as follows:
Overture, "Asmodeus," orchestra; violin
?nlo, "Fantaisie Ballet," Mr. T. F. Rosenthal
(Miss EIsCOO accompanist); president's ad
dress, Everett J. Brown; soprano solo, "Sum
mer Ciinmiuadi-," Miss Florence Doane;
narcli, "Under the Double Eagle," orchestra.
Everett J. Brown was president of the
day. Tho junior orchestra was compOÃ^d
ol: CurtC, Davi?, director; Miss Florence
Doane, vocalist; T, F. Kosenthal, violin
soloist.
Th 3 junior dny committee were: J.
Hoppe (chairman), Mi?s McCleane, Allen
Chickerlug, G; j orge .Clark, Miss Barto,
Miss Whipple. E. W. Siadtmuller.
Mr. Wood and MiasÃoardman were the
coaches lor the farce.
It is estimated that not less than 1200
people witnessed the farce, and the whole
periormance was undoubtedly the best for
many years.

CORBETT AND
BOB FITZSIMMONS
Olympic Club Will Give
$5,000 for a Ten- Round
Bout.
James Is Willing-, but Robert
Says It Must Bs a Fight to
a Finish.
Julian Says That Corbett Is Bluffing,
and That He Should Accept
Stuart's Off;r.
The Olympic Club is in the field as a
bidder for a contest between Bob Fitz
simmons and James J. Corbett.
The directors met last Friday evening
and instructed William Kennedy, the
superintendent, and Howard Taylor, the
indefatigable leader of the club, to go
ahead and consummate a match between
those two famous exponents of the manly
art if possible.
A telegram was immediately sent to
Corbett in New York, stating that the
club would allow him $1000 expenses and
give a purse of $10,000 for a ten-ronnd con
test between him and Fitzsimmons.which
contest must be held in this City under
the club's an.-pices.
Last evening a reply was received from
Corbett which read as follows:
If you will give a purse of $15,000 I will
talk business. Answer and tell me best offer.
Will rost me considerable to bring trainers to
San Francisco. J. J Corbett.
Messrs. Kennedy and Taylor left the
club last evening purposely to see Julian
and Fitzsimmons in the matter and get
their answer to the offer, but wnen a Call
representative saw Julian at a late hour
last evening lie said that be had not seen
any person from the Oiympic Club, and
did not know anything about the pro
posed purse.
"You can state, however," said lulian,
"that we will do nothing in the way of
match-making until this Sharkey and
F-tznmmons affair is settled.
"Regarding Corbett's actions I must say
that they are very puzzling. A few
months ago he came out openly and said
that if Fi;zsimmons wanted to meet him
it must be in a finish right or not at"all.
When he found that Dan Stuart had ar
ranged to carry oft a fight to a finish free
from police interference, he turned tail
and accepted an offer made to him by
some New York club to fight Fitz a
rwenly-rotmd contest. Now he makes
another move and states his willingness
to fight in this City, when he knows only
too well that Fitzsimmons has accepted
Stuart's terms to fight to a finish on Texas
soil.
"What kind of in-and-out-work do you
call this?
"Now, I don't care wheie the contest is
held, so long as it is to a finish. I have
every reason to believe that Fitz would be
accorded fair and honorable treatment by
the Olympic Club of this City, but that's
not the question at issue. I have already
given my word and honor to Dan Stuari
that he has the first call on Fitzsimmons
and 1 do not propose to break my word.
In case Stuari sliould fail to carry out his
agreement, then 1 will talk business with
the Olympic Club if that organization can
arrange for a finish fight."
'Now, Mr. Julian, if Corbett should re
fuse the offer made by Stuart for a finish
I'm lit, what do you propose to do in the
premises?"
"Why, what can we do? Isn't that evi
dence "sufficient to prove tuat this stiff,
Corbeit, does not want to fight Bob? In a
ten-round contest, supposing he should
act in the manner he did with Sharkey
when the sailor had him pumped out â
you know he hueged Sharkey for dear
lifeâ he may use those same tactics and
hold out to the end. Oh, no ! It must be a
finish fight or nothing."
Fitzsimmons was en joying a canvasback
duck dinner at the Baldwin when he was
apprised of the Olympic Club's offer and
Corbett's acceptance to a $15,000 pu-se.
Fitz looked a bit surprised at first, but,
after he had taken a couple of short jabs
with the steel at the "ribs" of the duck,
he muttered something about Corbett
which would not sound pleasant to the
ears of the champion if he happened to be
within hearing distance.
"I don't want to bother myself about â
what do you call himâ the champion, did
you say?
"Oh, well. I guess be is the champion
talker all right, but he won't fieht me,
and he has proved tbat in more ways than
one. Why don't he accept Dan Stuart's
effer? Isn't it good enough for him?
Well, pshaw! I'm losing my appetite talk
ing about that fellow.
"Will I fight him in the Olympic Club?
"Yes, I'll fight him anywhere on top
of God's green earth if the match is to a
finish, and I'll knock the top oi his head
off the first punch I'll hit nim. But he

It's largely a matter of health. The

me about the champion? Let him accept
Stuart's offer, if he means business, and
I'll guarantee that there won't be much
left of nim after I have finished decorating
his face," and Fitz cut another gash in
the duck's side.
It is hoped by the better class of sports
men of this City that the Olympic Club
will secure the next meeting between the
two greatest fighters of the day.
FREDERICK-STREET CARS.
The Disused Une Suddenly Revived
and Brought Into Active
Operation.
The Market-street Company astonished
the residents of the Ashbury Heights by
placing electric-cars on Masonic avenue
and Frederick street yesterday morning.
The first intimation the people on these
two streets had that the Market-street
Railway Company remembered them was
when they saw half a dozen laborers with
brooms and scrapers removing sand and
dirt that had accumulated over the rails
during the past twelve mouths.
The next surprise in store for the people
ob the south side of the part panhandle
was yesterday morning, when two trans
formed horsecars belonging to the old
Fourth-street line hove in sight over the
O:ik-streot hill, and meandered around
until they eveutually brought up on
Masonic avenue at its junction with Page
street.
Thence the car went up the hill and
succeeded in rounding the mound into
Frederick street, where car and man sped
along to First avenue.
A similar perlormance was gone through
by car 2, and thus Masonic â¢ avenue and
Frederick street were at last brought into
direct communication with town.
Those cars run, or are supposed to run,
every five minutes. It takes eighteen
minutes to make the round trip. At pres
ent the transfer points are at Oak street
and Masonic avenue and llaight street and
Masonic avenue.

Over 500 separate pieces of delicately

day afternoon and evening to the large
main parlor of the Occidental Hotel.
It was the occasion of the second annual
exhibit of the work done by the Dresden
Keramic Club, a woman's art society of
this City. The members of the club, some
twenty-five in all, and their friends pre
sided over the different tables and were
largely instrumental in making the exhi
bition a charming social gathering, par
taking much of the nature of an afternoon
tea and an evening reception.
It would be difficult among so many
exhibits to particularize and be just to all.
Tne most generally admired exhibit, per
haps, was a beautiful chocolate set in gold
and foft rich brown, the handiwork of
Mrs. Walter Graves.
The whole center-table was given over
to work by the president of the club, Mrs.
Chester S. Pollard. A large table at one
end of the room was covered with pretty
things done by Mrs. Freeze and by Mrs.
Walker Graves. At the opposite end of
the room was a similar table ndorned with
ail manner of dainty ware made beautiful
by the brushes and skill of Miss Emily
Hprzer and Mrs. Joe Green. Another large
lable bore a collection of exquisite piece s
made so by Mrs. H. V. Scott, Miss Emma
Staples and Mrs. Frank Kelly.
Then there were two smaller tables side
by side with the exhibits of Miss Murphy,
Mrs. Sanborn and Mrs. Switzer: a pretty
array on a single little table in a far cor
ner presided over by Miss Fricke as her
individual contribution; another table
near the entrance laden with frail, shell
like bits of decorative work done by Miss
Hoesch; an 1 still another corner table
with the combined exhibits of Mrs. Gra
ham and Miss Scbwerin; and finally a
numerous display on one small table,
showing th" ability of the two little Graves
orothprs, Walker and Jeffs â boys several
years yet, f 10m thejr teen?.
At the conclus'on of the exhibition the
club members eu joyed a supper served in
the hotel dining-room.

ACCUSES HIMSELF
OF A CRIME
Strange Story Told by
Ralph Duncan From
Omaha.
Wanted to Be Restrained From
Committing a Greater
Offsnse.
He Was Locked Up in the City Prison
Pending tb.2 R?ceipt of Advices
From Omaha.
A man giving his name as Ralph Dun
can was locked up in the City Prison
yesterday after telling an extraordinary
stor}'.
Justice of the Peace Barry occupied the
bench in Judge Conlan's court for a short
time yesterday afternoon to hear the Â«es
timony of some witnesses in a case that
came before him during Judge Conlan's
vacation after the elections.
After he adjourned court, Duncan, who
had been sitting in the rear of the court
room, followed him along the corridor to
his chambers.
"I noticed yon in court,'' said Duncan,
"and your face shows me that I can talk
with you and trust you. Now, supposing
you had committed a crime and you felt
that you would commit a greater crime
unless you were restrained, what would
you do?"
"That is a peculiar question," replied
the Judge. "You don't suppose that lam
going to give you advice as to committing
a crime?"
"Well," said Duncan, "that's my posi
tion. I committed a crime, and I feel
that unless I am restrained I will commit
a greater. I will either kill myself or kill
somebody else. Now, what can I do?"
The Judge took Duncan into Chief
Crowley T s office, and Bailiff Kelly, who
was there at the time, escorted him to the
City Prison.
Captain kobinson questioned him and
he told the same story. He said he had
been once confined in an asylum in the
East. He came here about ten days ago
in search of work, but had been unable to
procure any. He was a olerk by occupa
tion. He declined to say where he came
from or what was the nature of the crime
he charged himself with committing, or
the one he felt impelled to commit. He
admitted that he was without funds, and
that was another reason whys he wanted
to be locked up.
"I could put a charge of vagrancy
against you," said the captain, "and you
would be sentenced for six months."
"I am no vagrant," said Duncan, as he
drew himself up.
"If I lock you up for a day or two as a
lodger, do you think you will be all right
then?" a?ked the captain.
"Yts, I think this feeling will wear
away in a day or two," replied Duncan.
Duncan was placed in a cell and later
Detective Bainbridge had a talk with
Him. He told Bainbridge that became
from Omaha, whpre he had been a clerk
for several years. He said he was 40
years of age, alihoueh he looks much
younger. He reiused to ray anything
about the crime. H- was troubled with
insomnia and suffered with nervous pros
tration.
Bainbridge, after leaving him, expressed
the opinion that Duncan was laboring un
der a hallucination brought on by his
nervous condition. But with the object
of finding out if there was any truth in
his statement of having committed a
crime, a dispatch was sent to the Chief of
Police at Omaha.
YOSEMITE NATIONAL FARK.
Report of Colonel Young, Acting Super
intendentâThieve* and Fire.
8. M. B. Young, lieutenant-colonel ol
the Fourth Cavalry and acting superin
tendent of the Yosemite National Park,
lias complied witn instructions from
Washington and sent to the Secretary of
the Interior a leport concerning the con
dition of affairs and the management of
the park. Colonel Young holds that the
park should be accurately surveyed and
the boundaries clearly defined. In order
to satisfy the rights cf bona-fide settlers
and preserve the purposes for which the
park was established ihe report suggests
an examination of the entire park and it 3
present boundary lines by a competent
and duly appointed commission. The ex
amination should be made before the act
ual survey. The report says*
"California, with her 20,000,000 acres of
magnificent timber, owns but little, if
any, of the land upon which it stauds.
The General Government has reserved
and controls about 6,548,000 acres of these
forest lands that regulate and conserve
the water supply of tne State, and upon it
rests the responsibility of providing the
proper means for the preservation and
management of these reservations. The
Yosemiie, Sequoia and General Grant
National parks comprise in all about
1,114,000 acres, leaving about 5,434,000
acres of tnese grand forests without any
practical protection against timt>er
thieves, sheepherders and their natural
sequence, destructive forest tires."
The report mentions that over 200 stands
of arms have been taken from persons
entering the park by the two main
thoroughfares, and as a possible resultant
young broods of quail and grouse abound
throughout the park. The deer, bear,
lynx, fox, coon, tree squirrel and chip
munk, although not scarce, are not so
plentiful as they should be in their natural
home ia the park. If firearms, hunters
and trappers are kept out of the park
they will multiply and become plentiful,
and their instinctive fear of man will
gradually so lessen in a few years that
visitors will be enabled to see and study
them in their natural state.
The report states that the stakes set by
the trespassers employed by the manage
ment of the Yos?mite Valley and Merced
Rtulway Company, to survey a route up
the Merced River from the western bound
ary line of the parK to the State grant
line have all been pulled up and destroyed.
Colonel Youne urges the necessity of
Congressional measures toward the ac
quirement of title by the Government to
all lands within the park boundaries. He
says: "So long as settlers own lands in
the park and live thereon trespass cannot
be entirely prevented."
Colonel Young, to clinch his argument,
sends to the Secretary oi the Interior this
aDt remark from Jotin Muir's Sierra Club
bulletin 7:
"The smallest reserve and the first ever
heard of was in the Garden of Eden, and
though its boundaries were drawn by the
Lord and embraced only one tree yet the
rules were violated by the only two set
tlers that were permitted on sufferance to
live in it."
McCALLA IS HONORED.
California Homing Club Elected
Him an Honorary
Member.
Naval Commander Thanked for Estab
lishing Homing Pigeon Servica
at Mare Island-
Commander McCalla of the United
States navy is very popular with the Cali
fornia Homing Club, on account of what
he has done to introduce the use of nom
ine pigeons into the naval service on the
Pacific Coast. Last evening the California
Homing Club held a meeting at 632 Mar
ket street and proceee'ed to unanimously
elect Commander McCalla an honorary
member of the club.
Commander McCalla was proposed for
membership by A. Carlisle, who remarked
that the commander, sagaciously foresee
ing and vigorously acting, lad adopted
measures which would be of material as
sistance in calling attention to the valu
able use 3to which homing pigeons may
be applied. Mr. Carlisle also predicted
that Commander McCalla's indorsement
of and panic pation in the work in which
all the members of the club were con
cerned would result in eventually aug
menting the membership of the club.
The nomination was seconded by J.
Welch, and the election weut through
with a rush.
The secretary of the club was instructed
to tend a communication to Commander
McCalla notifying him of his election.
The communication which was for
warded was in part as follows:
The California Homing Club at a regular
meeting held this evening has unanimously
e.ecied you an honorary member of the club
in token of appreciation oi the practical assist
ance which you have rendered to those who are
seeking to have the merits of homing pigeons
more widely recognized on the Pacific Coast.
Please be assured th.it this club will always be
ready to co-operate with you, in viow ol the
public benefit which you have in mind
through the use of homing pigeons upon ves
sels ol the United States navy to carry mes
sages, in any movement calculated to perma
nently establish and extend the scope of the
service.
POULTRY EXHIBIT.
Domestic Fowl and Pigeon Dealers to
Have a Grand Display.
The directors of the Pacific Poultry and
Pigeon Association held a meeting at their
headquarters, 417 Sacramento street, last
Tuesday evening. There is a great deal of
enthusiasm being shown by the fanciers
of poultry and pigeons, and the association
expects to have over 3000 birds on exhibi
tion at this their second annual show, to
be held in tbeeiposition buildings in Oak
land January 23 to* 31 inclusive. They
have secured the services of J. K. Felch of
Notic. Mass., better known as "the sage of
Natic," to place the ribbons.
There wiil be very keen competition in all
classes, especially" the Plymouth Rock,
Minorcas and Leghorns, the
clubs of these varieties having offered
some very handsome trophies, such as
cups and medals. New York and Massa
chusetts will be represented in the show
room, also some birds from the Crystal
Pa. ace show in England. The egg and
broiler exhibit will be recognized very
handsomely by cash and special premi
ums, prizes having been offered for the
best white eggs and the best brown eggs
and for the heaviest broilers.
The object of this exhibition is to edu
cate the poultrymen on this coast to the
fact that if Pacific Coasters can increase
the size of the broilers by special feed, etc.,
and in less time, it will not be necessary
to send East to supply tlie home market.
California sends over $3,000,000 lo the East
annually for poultry and eggs.
The management has also offered some
handsome prizes to tue piceon fanciers.
The homers will have a chance to show
their qualities the la*t day of the show.
DENOUNCED THE SCHEME.
The Labor Alliance Meels a New Socieiy
of Idle Men.
The following preamble and resolutions
have been adopted by the San Francisco
Trades and Labor Alliance:

that a certain class oi unemployed have organ
ized themselves in this City and have lor one
of their objects the offering of iheir members
to employers Jor employment at half the rate
of wages now being paid by them to their em
ployes; and whereas, every â workingman will
see that this is contrary to the work all the or
ganized unions of the world have tried to ac
complish and that this is one step backward;
be it
Resolved, Â£y the San Francisco Trades and
Labor Alliance, that we denounce the ring
leaders of this scheme as the enemies of or

MADE A BREAK
FOR LIBERTY
Georga Taylor and George
Williams Escape From
Custody.
They Were Being Taken to
Court to Receive Ttieir
Sentences.
Taylor. Was Recaptured by a Special
Officer, but Williams Was
More Fortunate.
Two prisoners who were being taken from
the City Prison to Judge Conlan's court
room yesterday morning to be sentenced
made their escape, but one ol them was
recaptured.
The prisoners were Georee Williams, a
well-known bunko steerer, who was con
victed of stealing a ham from A. Harring
ton, a butcher on Fourth street, and
George Taylor, convicted of petty larceny
and carrying concealed weapons. Taylor
is the man who was arrested early Tues
day morning by Policeman George Doug
lass on Post and Jones streets, and when
searched a piece of iron bar sixteen inches
long and a revolver were found in his pock
ets. He said he carried them because he
wanted to be arrested, but the police be
lieved tbat he was out with toe intention
of committing robbery.
Bailiff Kelly and Policeman Maurice
Behan left the prison shortly before 10
o'clock with nine prisoners. Six, who
have to answer to felony charges, were
handcuffed together, and Taylor, Wil
liams and another prisoner, who were
charged with misdemeanors, were not
handcuffed. Behaa walked in front and
Kelly behind.
When they reached ths entrance to
Judge Conlan's court Williams and Tay
lor made a break for liberty. At that hour
there is always ft crowd in the corridor
waiting for admittance to the courts, and
Williams went through the crowd to the
north entrance to the hall from McAllister
street and made his escape.
Taylor ran along the corridor to the hall
entrance from Lurkin street, next to the
Chief of Police's office. He rushed down
the steps into Larkin street and ran along
to Birch avenue, between Fulton and
Grove strpets.
Special Officer Lewin of the Southern
Pacific Company was in Judge Conlan's
court on Friday when Taylor was con
victed. He had a good look at him,
which proved very fortunate. Lewin was
walking along Ash avenue to the hall
when he saw Taylor rushing down
the steps. He concluded at once
that Tavlor had mode his escape and
gave chase. He gradually overhauled
Taylor, and as the latter turned
into Birch avenue he was not many yards
behind him. Lewin pulled oat his re
volver and called upon Taylor to stop or
he would shoot. Taylor stopped an l
threw up his bonds.
Lewin took Taylor back to the court
room. By this time Judge Conlan was on
the bench and he at once sentenced Tay
lor to one year in the County Jail, six
months on each charge.
Every effort is being made to capture
Williams, and it is expected that he will
be behind the bars soon.
The escape of the two prisoners wns re
ported to Cnief Crowley by Captain Rob
inson and a thorough investieation will be
made so as to shoulder the responsibility
upon the proper rerson.
A BALLET MASTER.
Arrival of Arnold Kiralfy, One of the
Spectacular Impresarios of London.
Arnold Kiralfy, one of the Kiralfy
brothers of the celebrated London spec
tacular productions, arrived in this Olty
last night under contract to produce a
grand ballet as one of the Christmas at
tractions at the Orpheum. Mr. Kiralfy is
going to bring five premieres and about
thirty coryphees from Ihe East, and the
rest of the corps will be recruited in this
City.
For a number of years Arnold Kiralfy
was connected with the old California
Theater; later he went to New York,
where he had the charge of such scenic
productions as "The Fall of Babylon,"
the "Siege of Taris," eta Lately tie has
been in London helping his brotner wiih
their "Venice," "Constantinople" and
other spectacles, which are supposed to
have been some of the most remarkable
scenic displays ever exnibited.
A Novelty Social.
On Friday evening the parlors of the Cen
tral Methodist Church were crowded with
members and friends of the Ladies' Aid So
ciety. William Abbott presided.
After singing the doxology and prayer by
Rev. E. R. Dtlle, Miss Lulu Mephiu sang. Miss
Erwin and Miss Mabel O'Brien rendered a
banjo and piano duet. Miss Jessie Haskins
recited and J. C. Jones sansr. Then followed
the special exercises of the evening. The roll
was called and each member responded wttn
a rhyme telling "How I Earned Mr Dollar."

â¢ put throuch the half-open windows of the
incurables' ward at the Children's Hos
â p-itai.. It was a child's voice, yet so mag
netic, in its sweetness that the sun-warmed
anr .seemed to ciing to the sounds as
though loth to lose them forever.

.way'in the old cemetery the wind whis
:.pe'ne'd the words through the branches of
: tryeteypress trees and they sighed on and
ph-over the white tombstones as though
in quest of something.
;'.; '. .-."You came to see our little band of he
joes-?" asked the bright-faced attendant
who met us at the door. Then she led the
way' down the long hall and into the ward
at the farther end. On a couch lay a tiny
form and from one end, where tbe bed
cjothine was turned down, emerged a lit
" tie - woolly head. Two great, big, black
"eyes looked out from the wasted face.
â¢ ' "This is Mamie Brown," said the at
tendant. "Mamie, tell the lady what you
.'are."
â  A spark of mischief Sashed into the
child's eyes for a second, as she said in a
Ipvp tired little voice, catching her breath
between each word:
"l-se â a â little â pickaninny !"
.Then, reaching up one hand, slie said,
"Hlease give me a flower," and holding
the pink rose in her hand, she smiled and
â¢began, in a voice that quivered when she
tried to make it strong:
"When I walk dat levee roun', ronn', roun',
I'he lookln' for dat nigger an' he can't be found."
"Are you feeling better to-day, Mamie?"
I asked.
"Yes'm. Say, Chris'mas is comin' !"
"And what shall Santa Claus bring
you?"
" ihe pathetic face grew almost happy in
its expression as she clasped her hands,
â  forgetful of the rose.
"Oh, a big balloon. Yes! a red one!"
"Shall I tell him to bring it here?"
"3Jaybe I'll go 'way." The voice was
very ismt and weak. A)ne had to bend low
to catch the sound. "But he'll find me."
A ray of sunlignt streamed through the
half-raised curtain and rested on the white
coverlid, and just touched the transparent
hand that held the beautiful rose, and
â¢then, stealing softly, it kissed the wasted
â¢cheek.- The wind sighed into the room,
"and drew the curtain sharply against the
' Window as it withdrew.

Odd Anticipations
of JVlerrvj Gkristmas
A deep-sen Santa Claus!
. ' v 'Eij:hc bells" are struck, and it is mid
day on the water front. Men of heavy
' build wearing long white aprons are stand
ing in doorways or behind bars ready to
serve steam beer and free lunch for a
nickel. Landlubbers from the ferries are
entering cable and electric cars through
their "booby hatches" and scooting away
with the aid of steam and electricity, lay
ing their courses in various directions.
"EiL-ht bells" play a tune good for hun
gry men 10 hear, for it is time to eat.
There are certain small wooden structures
on the water front, having a "list" to port
or starboard, standing, like jovial tars, a
little unsteadily, braced as If not quite
sure of their sea legs. On the weather
side of these several sons of Italy owning
bootblack-stand 3 uae shoebrushes ostensi
bly, but tbeir real mission is to holy-stone
off the corns of their patrons, which they
do'witb every indication of keen delight.
Just after "eight bells" comes the soci
able time of the day on the front. True it
is that eating seems to be something to be
done like stowing cargo â that is, it must
be done with some specd â but when tne
midday cargo of lunch is in there is a slack
time when everything is discussed, from
the Sharkey-Fitzsimmons tight upward
and downward. Neptune's sons, nephews
and longshoremen â distant relatives â
take in the sunshine, tr.iff the familiar
odors of salt water and tar commingled,
and are unconscious of the vague suspicion
of countrymen that they are so "salt" that
bnrnacles are growing on them.
That is to say, that the whole commu
nity, for a depth of a block or two and a
g/>od part of a degree of latitude, is dis
tinctly aquatic, sun-browned, muscular,
speaking all the "lingoes" of the civilized
globe, and of much area that is less civil
ized, with an inherent love of fun and in
herited tendencies for walking with hands
in pockets and with coat collars invari
ably turned up in the back of the neck.
An easier-tempered and kindher-hearled
set of men never formulated thoughts,
which, like seagulls, are upon the water
most of the time.
Odd characters came in on ships, odd
types of "Jack, the man behind the gun,"
types of men from every island or main
land where stormy breezes blow or billows
break along tbe shore. They are. one
and allâ the odd people, that is to sayâ
-semi - humorously inclined. Some are
hairy and some hairless; some with a
stock of sea yarns reminiscent of Sinbad;
some with a capacity for drinking that
would mate them prime favorites with
both Bacchus and Gambrinus â prime min
isters in their bibulous couris, keepers-in
chief of the keys of the royal wine cellars
and breweriesâ men able to wrestle with
king John Barleycorn long and faithfully.
Latterly there has appeared at the noon
hour at one of the eailor boarding-houses
the oddest of all odd characters, his real
name unknown, but jocularly called by
chance acquaintances "Captain Jack
Whiskers," also called by others "the Â£ea
Santa Claus." This last title fh.iicates,
not only his general appearance, but also
suggests a new line of thinking.
Suppose that some day, when the fog
trumpets and fog sirens about the bay
seemed to be calling for more fog, a stout,
rather under-sized man in a pea- jacket,
the collar being turned up in the back as
a matter of course, should dispense such
an aroma of Medford rum at a boat land
ing a* he came ashore as to make it seem
safe to bet that he could be sniffed out by
his fragrant wake at a distance of a block.
Suppose that from his bushy whiskr-rs
he should skakeoff drops of fog, like snow
nakes, just like a real Santa Clausâ as real
as an >'- Then, drawing from the depths

selves in chairs, or played languidly about
on the warm, sunny floor.
''I've got two hips," volunteered Don,
as I r-at down beside him.
"That is the common expression that
we use," the attendant said, laughing.
"He means that he has the disease in
both hips."
"I've been here four years," said Don
ajjain, looking at me with his comical
almond-shaped eyes and a queer smile on
his round, polished face. "Yep, I like it;
guess I'll stay always," he replied re-
"What are you, anyway, Don?" asked 1,
marveling at his pure English and correct
pronunciation.
â¢â¢I'm a McKlnley," exclaimed he
prouilly, trying to sit up on the stretcher.
"An a 'Merican," he added, as we all
laughed. "What's Santa Claus goin' to
bring me? A box of paints, an' a pair of
reins. Then I can play horse with the
foot of the stretcher an' I won't mind its
hurting. Brave? Well, I couldn't cry,
'cause I'm a 'Merican, you know."
Bright, cheerful little spirit! Hasn't it
been written somewhere that he who
would receive a reward of happiness must
become as a little child? Up tbe stairs
we proceed and across the way to the
newly finished incurables' ward. The
little bodies turned on their beds of pain
and the childish faces brightened as we
entered. At the bedside of pretty Ger
trude Untried our guide paused. And who
could help pausing?
In sharp contrast with the closely
cropped heads and emaciated faces of the
other sufferers were this child's mass o!
thick brown curls and the rich coloring in
her cheeks and lips. Half reclining
against the pillows with her small, per
fectly formed hands lying on an autoharp,
she made a picture of beauty one would
bag of tobacco, suppose he should begin to
emit smoke, his mild, blue eyes taking on
the look of languorous contentment which
belongs to the sun-baKed children of the
tropics, bis lips ripe and red as coral, for
instance, and the fat upon him, as the
story-books say, "shaking like jelly."
Brown of whisker and ruddy as to com
plexion, both hands thrust deep in his
pockets, his watchchain showing a dang
ling anchor as a chaim, rolling a little in
his gait as becomes a loyal seaman, a nav
igator and a sailoring gentleman who fol
lows tbe sea for the sake of fresh air â and
gets not much else. That is he.
The whole water-front population, espe
cially the younger part, are ready to adopt
a maritime Santa Claus â brown whiskers,
pea-jacket, submarine Christmas gifts,
shells for tbe Christmas tree instead of
gewgaws from the shops as adornments,
mermaid baby dolls and all. Tbe marine
Santa Claus is something new. And why
not really have a nautical Santa Ciaus for
San Francisco?
Our artist has humorously caught the
spirit of the demonstration which will at
tend a wider knowledge of "Captain Jack
Whiskers" as he navigates the water-front
streets, bat he has not imagined the
sailors' Christmas- tree celebration. Im
agine the services beginning with the
lusty "chantey" :
Old horse, old horse, how came you here?
It may be only a coincidence,
happening along just before Christmas
time, but the fact is tbat lately
tne stocking peddler has been through all
the haunts of sailors on East, Steuart and
other water-front streets. Sailors, taking
turns back and forth, to and fro on the
sidewalks, never stopping as they vigor
ously talked, walking as if they were on
the decks, have been among his auditors,
but his sales have been few. He appeared
about the time that the "Sea Santa Claus"
began to amuve the water front.
"In all latitudes," said one sailor, "I

TWO SUNSETS.
I.
Across the vale the sun is sinking,
Behind the forest-covered hill.
The gloomy, cloudy day is dying ;
The cold November wind is still.
11.
A gray, sad day, but watch its closing.
The dull clouds part and now they show
Their edges, golden, silver, crimson,
And sparkling in the ruddy glow.
111.
The west grows bright with rosy beaming.
The colored rays strike down the vale ;
The day is smiling c'en while dying,
And death and all his terrors fail.
IV.
I know a life whose sun is sinking
Behind death's dark and misty hill;
A cloudy, storm-tossed life is closing,
A weary heart will soon be still.
V.
A gray, sad life, but watch its closing ;
The old eyes see beyond the gloom,
And clouds that were so dark and heavy
Show lights of gold and flecks of bloom.
VI.
The light that gleams above death's
mountain

A Splervdid Tribute to
a Faithful SlaVe
Whan a man has been dead forty-six
years it is rather late to write a tribute to
his memory. But this is an instance
where a conjunction of circumstances
crowded out tbe facts, and the good which
tbe man did was almost interred with his
bones.
A writer for the New York Sun re
cently made a journey into tbe counuy
near Harrieville, Mo., the county seat of
CasÃ, the county adjoining that in which
Kansas City is situate. A few miles from
the county seat two graves were seen from
the highway. They were conspicuous
more from neglect than otherwise. The
man who was acting as guide said, in a
matter-of-fact manner, as he coaxed the
team:
"One is in the grave of the mistress; the
other, that of her faithful negro man. He
was buried beside ber, as you see, at her
request."
Of course, be explained, they died about
the same time. The mistress was told a
short time before her death that the old
slave was dead.
"They were victims of the cholera,"
continued the guide, "when that awful
scourge swept over the country. It almost
depopulated Harrisonville. Every doctor
in the town was stricken down, and then
the only men in the town who sold
drugs or knew anything about medicine
dropped dead in their work. After that
those who were left died in their turn, it
seemed, and without any assistance. Two
of the latter lot were those who are buried
in the graves we have just passed. The
women was the wife of the oldest and best
doctor in the town, John McÃeynolds.
"When the California gold fever struck
the whole country Dr. McÃeynolds caught
it, and he joined that long procession
which whitened the plains and crossed
the mountains. He took with him his
faithful body servant, an old negro who
had been his property from infancy. He
had attended his master so long that the
been in the hospital seven years. She ha
wasted away until her little frame has
only tbe skin stretched over it.
"I have a spine!" she remarked de
murely, as she closed her lips together
like a little old woman. There is nothing
about the w ole hospital that Rose doesn't
know. She tells the nurses where to find
everything that is needed, she orders the
doctors and attendants about, and there is
not a child on her side of the ward who
does not obey the slightest sound of her
thin little voice. Rose knows the exact
state by her temperature each day, but
she is always hopeful and brave, and never
complains. But Rose wasn't quite sure
that it was not too childish to ask for
Christmas presents, and she wasn't quite
sure which, of all the things she heard
about, she wanted the most.
As I turned away the attendant whis
pered, "The children, May and Emily, are
going to sing for you."
Softly at first and then more strongly
the two little voices trembled upon the
air. The child who could not lift her
head, nor scarcely her hand, from weak
ness, lay pouring out her soul in a sweet,
plaintive voice, while the other sang with
all the fervor of sweet hopefulness, "I am
a little beggar-girl."
There was no other sound in the ward.
Even the little babes hushed their fretful
plaints and lay with their big, earnest
eyes wide open, listening. Only one little
child reacned out ber hand and caught
mine and smiled up into my face. Tears?
How can we shed tears in the presence of
angels? As tbe pathetic melody died
away the silence was broken only by a
sigh from the child who held my hand.
"What is it, dear?"
"Nothing, onlyâ only my mamma is in
San Jose, and â and she's had a pretty
hard time; she's so sick now, and she
can't work, you know, and I haven't seen
my papa since I've been here, and â oh â
onâ"
The little heart-broken sobs and the
nurse's low, comforting voice reached me
as we went down the stairs. Innocent, and
suffering such physical pain, and home
sick, too!
"I am glad that somebody somewhere
wrote, 'Of such is the kingdom of heaven.'
I suppose it will be all right if parents and
balloons and reins and dolls come pouring
in here to-morrow, won't it?"
The attendant looked ber surprise. But
after I got into the air there came to me
the whole verse irom that old Bible: "Suf
fer little children to come unto me, and
forbid them not, for of such is the king
dom of heaven !"
"I suppose they would be happier to en
ter into that heaven, but I think we need
them here!"
"What are you talking about?" asked
the artist.
"The brightness of the sunbeams," said

master regarded him as necessary to his
welfare. The old servant often accom
panied bis master in the calls of the latter
on his patients.
"When the doctor reached the gold
country he gave up vis profession and be
came a miner, and the old servant was his
assistant in that, as he had been in other
things in the States. They were success
ful. At the end of a year the old doctor
had $lu.ooo in gold, and that was a fortune
then. But in the midst of his luck he was
taken sick and died, His nurse, attendant
and undertaker was his faithful servant
Asa. They did not waste much time on
funerals out in that country in those days.
After Asa had buried his master he owned
himself. He was in a country where there
was no slavery and had the entire pos
sessions of his master in bis own hands.
No legal steps that might have been taken
n Missouri could have reached him. He
was a rich man.
"I have been told, but I do not remem
ber the particulars, that some of the people
in the mines, who believed that Dr. Mc-
Reynolds left a fortune, undertook in
various ways to get it. But the old
servant thwarted them all, and succeeded
in getting out of ihe country. His journey
back across the plains was an eventful
one. He was followed and tracked and
often forced to resort to strategy to evade
his pursuers. Once he buried the fortune
of his master in tbe sand of the desert
when he was hard pressed, and in escap
ing from a band o! desperadoes he found
h<mself a captive of Indians. What
his fate might have been you can guess if
he had not had a bit of good luck about
that time. Some sort of an epidemic had
broken out in the tribe where he was held,
and as Asa was a sort of a doctor from ob
servation he experimented on the sick
reds with such success that they regarded
| him as a special dispensation for their
! benefit from the hands of the Great Spirit.
J In this way he regained his freedom, re
turned to the place where he had buried
the fortune of his master, resurrected it
and resumed his journey without further
molestation.
"He reached Independence, Mo., and
called upon a man who had been a patient
and friend of his master. This friend
accompanied him to Harrisonville, and
was the messenger who gave Mrs. Mo
Reynolds the first information cone >rning
the death of her husband. Then the
friend told her about her faithful servant
Asa; and this was followed by calling in
the old servant from the negro quarters,
and he rendered to bis mistress an ac
count of his stewardship, with the larger
amount of his master's fortune.
"I have been told by some of the very
oldÂ«limers that Asa was the first colored
man who ever received anything like an
ovation in Missouri. When Harrisonville
heard of the old negro's return he was in
vited to the homes of the people, and had
greater glory than any white man who
! has ever lived there since.
"His mistress gave him his freedom and
some of the money; I don't know how
much. But he remained her faithful
servant. He refused to accept his free
dom as long as his mistress lived.
"The cholera came, as I have said, and
one of the victims was the mistres" of Asa.
He cared for her and was her attendant
until he was stricken himself. When he
failed to respond to her call she suspected
the reason, and then it was told her that
he was dead. She knew her time had
come and she hardly had time to request
that his remains be placed besides her's,
and it was done. And there are their
graves. Only a few people living know
even the names of the dead, and not many
know the story 1 have told you. If I were
a rich man I would put a monument over
the grave of that colored man, and I would
just bave a few words on it after his name
something like this:

THE WONDERFUL MYSTERIOUS RUINS OF ANCIENT BOLIVIA
The exploration of the mysterious ruins
of Lake Titicaca. in Bolivia, has been the
object of one of the expeditions sent out
by the Pennsylvania Mu?eum, and tne
collections representing the first year's
work, from February, 1895, are now dis
played in American Hall, says Stew
art Culm in tue Philadelphia Times. This
undertaking, planned by Mis. Cornelius
Stevenson, supported by a small commit
tee, of which Dr. William Pepper has
ncted as chairman, and executed by Dr.
Max Uhle, a trained and skillful explorer
of the most distinguished reputation, has
yielded the most valuable results.
Lake Titicaca, or Chuquito, occupies a
valley or plateau, which forms the most
elevated tableland in the globe, with the
exception of that of Thibet. The lake is
actually 12,600 feet above the lev^l of the
sea. It has an extent of 3220 square miles
and within it lie several islands, from one
of which, called Titicaca, Manco Capac
and bis consort, the great founders of the
empire of the Incas, are fabled to have
issued to spread civilization, industry and
government among the surrounding" na-
tions. Its irregular shores are lined with
ruins, and near the southern shore, at
Tiahuanaco. are cyclopean remains of
vas-t edifices, apparently never completed.
In this basin of Lake Titicaca lived a
race known as the Aymara, differing from
the natives southward. Their language
. survives, still spoken by the Indians of the
lake, where also are found remnai ts of a
savage tribe called Urus, who live among
the reed beds and islan s. Few spots in
,the world offer more tempting opportuni
ties to botii the archaeologist and eihnolo
" gist, or even the general traveler. The
scenery is wild and beautiful beyond de
scription. The inhabitants â a mixture of
various races, chiefly Spaniards with tne
' In<lian nativesâ preserve many traditions
of the past. The ruins are among the most
stupendous on the American continent,
and the soil is so rich in remains of prehis
toric antiquity that implements, arms and
pottery are yielded by every touch of tne
spade. Bui exploration in this remarka
ble land is not without its drawbacks.
Transportation is difficult, the inhabitants
. suspicious of exp orer-, and the most belt
denying effort has been necessary to ac
â¢ cumulate the rich scientific treasures that
are now snown at the university.
Above the long rows of flat cases con
taining the objects are a series of photo-
graphs illustrating the lake, its ruins and
the ex sting Indians. The first picture
represents the construction of a balsa or
straw boat on the island of Paco. These
are the boats with which the ancient
Indians used to navigate the dangerous
waters of the lake. In the case beneath
are numbers of rounded stones, grooved
for a straw rope, t c anchors of the balsas
used iv the early time. Tuis boat of straw
is nearly identical with a boat constructed
by the African natives, to which it fur
nishes a curious and interesting parallel.
Among the many arts possessed by the
people of Titicaca was that of working in
metal. Gold, silver, copper, bronze, and
even lead were wrought by casting and
hammering into many useful and orna
mental forms, as are attested by the
specimens s. own. Most numerous area
kind of needle or hairpin cailed a "topo,"
usually with a flattened heaa, sometimes
made to represent the Lead of a llama or
bird. One of gold Las abeaien head three
inches in diameter, with an embossed hu
man face. These same ornaments are still
made and worn by the Indians in Bolivia
and Peru.
Gold is found very plentifully in the
mountains of Bolivia, but the mines are
not extensively worked through the ex
pense of reducing the ore. There is shown
in the Royal Museum at Madrid a mass
of native gold found by an Intiian near
La Paz that was sold for $11,269, and it
was doubtless from native goid that the
specimens shown were manufactured.
Silver, however, is tne staple product of
the country, and from Potosi alone, from
the middle of tne sixteenth century down
to the year 1800, no less than $823,950,509
were coined, while the total product of
the Bolivian mines down to that time is
estimated at $1,617,901,018 in 255 years.
The silver specimens comprise many
POMP AND PAGEANTRY AT THE MAYOR OF LONDON'S SHOW
First we scrambled up to the top of the
omnibus in hot haste. It was well to have
something hot on such a morning. The
instant the great lumbering vehicle came
pounding down the street the waiting
crowd attacked it and ruen and women
burst inside and sat down suddenly and
firmly, panting and breathless but shel
tered on the warm velvet seats. Those
who had too little presence of mind and
too much absence of body to "get there' 1
climbed on top and choked back violent
language into the depths of their
inadequate coat collars.
And yet the sun shone through the mist,
a faint blur of pinkish yellow, the air was
as sharp as a knife and as fresh as â well,
it was extremely fresh. Comparisons are
especially odious when you cannot think
of a suitable one. And the sky was actu
ally blueâ a pale, washed-out, irresolute
biue.
Two boys in the seat behind the driver
were discussing with that fat functionary
the possibility of climbing the Nelson
monument in order to see the Lord
Mayor's show. Two women in the oppo-
Bite seat declared nervously that they did
hope Alfred could secure a window; they
never coult stand on tne street.
The man in the next row expressed his
scorn of such things in stentorian tones,
addressing the world at large and calling
it monkey play and an olÂ«i woman's tricks
just fit for children and women and idiots
and strangers. He growled like distant,
thunder, pulling <*t his moist beard ..nd
spitting every now and then with great
emphasi-* into the street. He glared at us
so that we felt that our destination was
written in drops of ice upon our guilty
brows. We tried to look as though we
were not going to the Lord Mayor's show,
as though we had not been impatient of
every delay and consumed with the fear
of missing one gorgeous red .-oldierman or
the vigorous blare of a single brass band.
We belonged to almost all the con
demned classes; we were confused into
trying to hide our identity â to look a>j
iittle as possible like children and women,
and idiots and strangers. Tne strain
upon our nerves was awful; it was a relief
when he stumbled over an artless um
brella and went down the steps like the
funny man in a regu'ar old-fashioned
melodrama. Only he seemed to be lackine
in any sense of humor.
His descent and disappearance cheered
our spirits; everythin chattered more
openlyâ our teeth, the windows, and the
women in the front seat.
Tne city was alive with people, and the
flags and banners of the corporations and
great guilds almost met overhead in the
narrower streets. Around Guild hall,
where the ceremonies were to take place,
"topos, " and a great pile of flat silver
plates, some round and some square, no
doubt intended to ornament some royal*
or priestly robe. Copper and bronze are
wrought in knives, in bells and bell-like
ornaments, in miniature human figures,
pierced for suspension, and among many
other objects into spoons with circular
bowls and long narrow handle-, bearing
at the top effigies of birds, dogs and the
inevitable llama.

was something ' almost inhuman. The

into the crisp, chill &ir resembled nothing
more than those that may be heard
around a circus tent when the animals are
about to be fed.
The Lord Mayor, hitherto Alderman
Fauvlet-Philips, is the first Lord Mayor
of London who has succeeded his father
in olttce. He enjoys an unusual popular
ity, and it was remarked upon by the
d^iily papers that for many years no civic
display liad met with such universal en
thusiasm.
The procession itseif was a curious
and not on interesting spectacle, the
modern and the ancient splendors neing
minded in a rather bewildering con
fusion. Patriotic as was the window of
the New York Life Insurance Company,
we were not convinced that a home
parade was not more di nified. We
missed, without yearning lor the "substi

meats or canned fruits which are such
distinguishing features of our Fourth of
July proce eions. There were floats, of
course, "England and Her Heroes," three

general symbolic car of Victory. Old
guns, manne-i by men in the uniiorms of
the early part of the century, were fol
lowed by the latest inventions of those
messengers of death.
In the regular troops t iere was that
magnificent precision that makes a great
body of men moving as one so form da
ble an engine of destructipn. The volun
teers, however, were far more to the
front, and they straggled along in brand
new uniforms, with occasional jeers from
the crowd, which threatened at one point
of the game to result in a hand-to-hand
squabble not in the programme. The
"regiment" suddenly broke into the
crowd and punched the heads of those

the martial strains of the first, playing a

unholy din. The 'Washington Post" was

in ihe form of a star. Two specimens
from the coast are exhibited with the orig

hair. Stone mortars also abound, with

It was impossible not to contrast the
procession, winding Mice a snake between
the dense masses, a vivid ribbon of crim

rare gayety of a spot of color in a child's

The pottery of Tiabaanaco is of a distinct
and peculiar type, far more elegant than
that of Ancon and the coast, and painted
with conventional designs once represent
ing men and animals. A common form is
a tall, beaker-like vessel, almost identical
with th* familiar druggists' mortar. Jugs
and bottles with handles and small plates
with curious patterns formed by little
llamas or birds painted in black upon a
red ground abound. The handles of these
plates are artistically wrought to repre
sent the beads of various animals.
Heads of the llama and its congeners,
the alpaca and vicuna, birds like the duck,
water hen, condor and curacoa, and the
domestic dog, of which two varieties were
known to the old Peruvians, are frequent.

vases. As elsewhere in America, he must
have occupied an important place in the
myths of these ancient people, for his

by which the pictured animals on the vases
have become conventionalized, disappear

white and black, which when arranged in
sequence can be connected with the orig

But these relics are trifling when com
pared with the ruins which must always
remain until earthquakes and the ages
work their final destruction. Casts,
measurements and photographs are all k
we can hope for, and these have been ob- '
tamed in abundance by the university's
explorer. Most famous of all are the
great monolithic stone gateways at Tia
buanaco, carved with the emblems of the
old religion, the object of fruitless spec
ulation and research since the time of the
Spanish conquest. Their age yet remains
a matter of conjecture, but they have
been assigned to a lost and prehistoric
empire, preceding by centuries that ol the

Capac, died in 1527. the year Pizarro first
appeared on the coast. The picture shows
the eastern front of the greatest of the
gateways, cracked by an earthquake, yet
still grand and impressive beyond descrip

this monument represents! Its sculp

is soon to be built upon the land given by

conception of the original structure.
Another branch of archaeological in
vestigation too often neglected by the ex
plorer is that of humar remains, not only
with reference to the mode of burial, but
the collection of the bones themselves.
And this forms for many the most inter
esting part of the recent work of the de
partment of archaeology. The interments
near the lake were in circular stone struc
tures, called cbulpas, from which were
obtained a number of skeletons wrapped
in coarse bags, wholly uulike the carefully
prepared mummies from the coast. Dr.
Charles Lester Leonard, of the Pepper
Clinical Laboratory, has made radiographs
of some of tnese specimens, disclosing
without tue removal of the wrappings the
bones and ornaments contained within
them.
One of bis pictures is that of a desic
cated foot of a mummy fron the ancient "T|
stone cbulpa at Campalachi. The leather â¢
sandal, which still remains attached, is
faintly shadowed behind ihe bones, which
are covered on the original by their dried
integument. The present collection is
arranged somewhat differently from most
archaeological collections, being displayed
witn the photographs to show the results
of each special exploration. Pictures of
the Indians, illustrating their dances and
festivals, give life and interest to the ex
hibit, which is one of more than ordinary
importance.
sions of old must have been a problem to
combat with, how to outshine the actual
every-day jticturesqueness of ordinary cos
tumes. What a sea of color must have
surrounded a similar sixteenth century
paeeant.
The crowd was interested chiefly in the
old stagecoach, one which actually car
ried her Majesty's mails between London
and York and which had for its guard a
man who had been on the road twenty
eight years. The passengers were lively,
indeed, butterflies of the fashion of 1790,
and were making merry as though they
had a long journey before them and bad
to beguile the time. 'In singular con
trast to this relic of old-time gayety

marks were distinctly audible.
"Wot about the . poor 'osses ! You've

"Made in Germany," yelled a flower-girl,
"Hooray for de motto can". The "motto
car" seemed to restrain a desire .to run
ahead, it panted like a thirsty dog, and
once when there was a clear space of some
thirty feet it ; shot ahead. "Grease,

At Guildhall the ceremonies were
shorter than the speeches. Minister Bay

that greeted him. American popularity
abroad has increased tenfold since the
election. It is regarded as the triumph of
law and orderâ a triumph in which Eu
rope was not only a "disinterested ob

The end of the display was the most in
teresting from the picturesque point of
view. The whole procession formed its
entire length, filing from east to west past
Guildhall Yard. The , great gold coach
behind "eight beautiful horses came lum

OUR STATE
UNIVERSITY
At a recent meeting of clergymen in
. this City the Rev. S. H. Wiliey, D.D., de
livered an address on "The College of
California; Its Founders and Our Inheri
. tance in Their Labors." As Dr. Wiliey is
the onJy surviving member of the original
board of trustees, the address embodies
the most authentic history of the early
days of the State University, and will
' therefore be of great interest to the
alumni and the many welJ- wishers of the
university who are proud of its rapid de
i velopment. Inasmuch as the university
'â¢â¢ Â«t Berkeley now takes rank among the
â ;'â¢ leadiug educational institutions of the
United States and has prospects of greatly
increased endowments and wide exten
sion, Dr. Willey's sketch of its earl? strug
gles and mention of the benefactors who
were instruments in its organization and
growth is of historic importance.
Dr. Wiliey is one of the pioneer clergy
men of San Franciscoâ perhaps the one
-whose experience has extended farthest
".* back into our early history. He started
from New York hither in December. 1848,
and when in New Orleans first heard the
momentous gold news. He did twelve
years' pastoral work in this City, from
1850 to 1862. Then came his long presi
dency of the College of California, and in
more recent years he has served the cause
of education as principal of Van Ness
Seminary. His mind is well stored with
recollections about early events in the
State and City, which are history to most
of the inhabitants now. His address was
not intended for publication, but was
composed soieiy to interest the circle of
clergymen to whom it was delivered and
at their request.
The first promoters of the Collece of
California were: Revs. S. H. Wiliey, John
W. Douglass, Joseph A. Ben ton and T.
Dwigbt Hunt. Douglass, Benton and
Hunt were graduates of Yale and Dr. Wil
iey graduated at Dartmouth. They be
gan to correspond and plan about a Cali
fornia college in the spung ol 1849. The
first effort at getting a site and property
was in San Jose, but the proposed dona
tions were not secured, and this plan
failed in 1850. In 1853 the Rev. Henry
Durant came to California and proposed
.to devote bis whole time to the founding of
the; college. He became tne leader and
the other four promoters co-operated with
him. He began with a school for boys,
â though there were very few ol them in
California. There was no great wealth in
the" Stale at that time, and the school
had to depend upon such annual sums as
the business men could afford to give from
their small incomes. This school was
located in Oakland and by Mr. Durant's
â¢fores. ght four blocks and included streets,
'.â¢east of Twelfth street, were obtained and
â¢ buildings erected thereon. Although
I this was only intended as a tempo
. rary location, the preparatory school grew

to the life class, in which he learns more
about painting and working in the higher
realm of his art. Apparently the best stu
dents in the School of Design have done
very well in this high stage, if one may
draw conclusions from the several clever
studies from life in the winter exhibitiou.
In the past many of the pupils con

objects as lamps, vases, copper pots,
boons and so on, or iittle studies of flow

third year Dr. Wiliey was appointed

paid for, tne third college class was ad

the ablest trustees at that time was Fred

W. A. COULTER'S SKETCH OF THE FAMOUS BRIG PILGRIM
ffff*^ HE subject of the accompanying illustration (by W. A. Coulter) is the famous Yankee brig Pilgrim,

J|Lf^ type of vessel was quite common along the Pacific Coast nearly fifty years ago; but to-day not a single
one of that rig can be found in these waters. This brig, it may be noted, is square- rigged on both masts.
It is a type of a time gone by, so far as this coast is concerned. The sketch herewith produced was made from
a paintinc done by a nephew of Captain Thompson of the Pilgrim. This brig sailed from Boston

subject be a study from nature â a tree, for
instance â every branch -is studied, the
play of light and shade portrayed with an
effort to be correct. Idealism and im
pressionism are tabooed, as no doubt the
teachers have convinced the pupils that
tilings must first be understood as they
seem.
Some of the pupils have been honored
with positions in the main gallery, though
the best work from them is in the con
servatory, where pictures are seen to ad
vantage in the superior light. It may
better be stated here that some of the best
artists have preferred hanging their pic
tures in the conservatory to display ing
them in the main gallery, where visitors
gather and receive first impressions.
Among the pupils' paintings in the
main gallery is a portrait, No. 30 on the
catalogue, by Miss Caroline E. Kixford.
This is a large canvas representing a
young woman sitting comfortably in a
chair; the color is worked out in harmoni
ous tones, above which a nicely molded
and expressive face appears in a warm
light. The picture is a strong study, with
much to commend it.
Manuel de Urunuela, a pupii, who of
fered to him, but bad health prevented
him from accepting.
In the fourth year the curriculum was
on a level with the best Eastern colleges,
and the scholarship was kept well up to
the best average. Dr. Wiliey was still
president.
Then came a time of hardship. Some
of the ablest trustees died and some went
away, and the college was in financial
straits. The authorities of the collece
went East for aid. The College Society
became interested, and the best known
late has been doing considerable out-of
door work, has "A Sketch in Alameda"â a
small painting, in which the artist has
put the character of the marsh country
with truthful coloring.
Joseph C. Eckler has a cool bit of im-
ture, "Evening in Sansalito," as evidence
that he hat been occupied with foliage and
sunset effects. Direcily opposite is a tiny
study, "An Oak," by Mrs. Geneve S;r
geant, on the line. Mrs. Jane G. Powers,
another pupil, exhibits "A Sunny Road,"
which will be found interesting in the
study she has made of sunshine and sunny
colors.
The largest canvas pent in by a pupil i*
one by Mrs. Mary T. Mentou en.itled
"Glenwood Grapes." Tbia is an ambitious
work on which induscry is stamped, and
witb. it the talent of the painter which
brings out the clusters of rich, purp.'e
grapes in their transparency ana bril
liancy.
What appears to be the best thing from
the pupils is in the conservatory. This is
the mysterious painting by J. Martinez, a
medalist, "Offering to Chac-Mol," the
Aztec fire god. There is something of
weirdness in the subject and the treat
ment of it that causes people to stop be
fore the picture. An Aztec kneels before
a stone altar covered with character writ

whom fire is burning in a vase iti front of

can you expect us to there, when we

college has received from the Ea?t does

to get Eastern aid the college was in a
perilous position.

pressed a deep feeling. The picture has
already been sold.
Miss Marion Holden has a "Study in
Black and Green," a nicely treated por
trait of a young girl. There is also a por
trait, "Worried," by Miss R'.xford, that is
worthy of notice, as the face represents an
Interesting study, and the color is pitched
in an odd key.
Mrs. L. Sleeth is here represented by a
portrait of a girl, an attractive subject,
painted in airy colors and evidencing re
rined taste in the general treatment. This
portrait shows out against its neighbors.
J. Raphael, a medalist, has an oil paint
ing on exhibition for the first time. He
calis it "A Mother." It is in a way quite
clever, this first picture of his, but the
painter affected something beyond the
student's province trhen striving after a
bizarre effect, combining impressions and
other things not always found in nature.
And yet tue picture is rich in suggestion,
an'l shows clearly that there is good ma
terial in its painter, as well as his search
ing propensities for someihing higher in
art.

afier an agreeable fashion.
But r scue was closer than they thought,
and Dr. WilJey thus tells the history of it:
Just at this time Dr. John Todd visited the
California institution and was very favorably
impressed with it He found it under the in
fluence of good men, and ii seemed to recon
cile to a lar, r e degree State control with moral
und religious influences. This turned the
thoughts oi many of the trustees and iriends
to the idea of a possible university here, in
which the college might be the central life.
Governor Low, who was one of our support
ers und was present at commencement, re
marked to me as he looked over the audience:
A happy subject that brings to mind an
illustration from a story book is a picture
of "The Village," by Mrs. JaneG. Powers, 1
a bright pupii of the art school. Its com
position gives a chance for study on tree?,
houses and bright snnny effects. The
village has its quaint steeple and its rude
homes showing through foliage, and a
strong light seems to color the whole
scene after a blithesome fssbion, which
may appear perhaps exuberant. But
there is evidence of close study and
thought in the picture.
Sidney J. Yard exhibits a pastel sunset
scene with much feeling in it, and also a
clever sketch from nature entitled,
"Sketch From Penitencia Creek." This
latter picture has a flavor of the open air
and indicates that the man who painted it
is at home with California landscapes.
"The Outskirts of the City," by Mr.
Urunuela, is a clever interpretation of a
gray afternoon in some spot in the suburbs
that appears familiar. It is a suggestive
bit of landscape, with a few houses in the
middle distance.
Miss Nora G. Cashin exhibits an "Out
door Study," which is nothing more than
a cluster of trees in shadow, yet it is con
scientious and a faithful portrayal of the
trees and the shafts of sunlight upon the
sward. She has another "Outdoor Study"
that has truth in it.
Mrs. Lucia K. Mathews has a small
pastel, a ''Sketch at Menlo, :> with good
color, though the sketch is a modest
thing in its way.
Wallace yon Helms and J. C. Ecfcler,
pupils, contribute to the collection of pen
and ink sketches.
In the National /\cadem\j.
It is a week since tbe fall exhibition of tbe
National Academy opened in New York,
and from all accounts it is coming in for a
generous share of patronage on the part
of the public. Taken on tbe whole it is
said to be better than last year's ezhibi-
tion, but much inferior to some of the ex
hibitions of past years.
A glance over the catalogue shows that
there are 340 pictures hung, and all of a
fair order oi merit. In fact, tbe exhibition
may be said to be unusually good in this
"Here you have a well-organized institution;
you have scholarship and prestige, but you
lack money. The State has none of these
things, but It has money. What a pity the
two things could not be brought together."
Next cume the question, Would the State
establish a university? It had never proposed
to do that. There had been bills and discus
sions about the establishment ol some indus
trial institutionâ some agricultural and me
chanical and mining arts collegeâ but noth
ing had ever been said about a literary and
scientific college, and there was no popular
demand for the use of the State's money in
that way.
respect. Nine-tenths of the exhibitors ar 3
painters who have worsed up some repu
tation. Of real bad work there seems to
be practically none.
But on the whole the exhibition is un
satisfactory to those interested in the
progress of American art. The really
good painters seem to have gotten into a
rut, and bob up with their same old sub
jects painted in their same old styles.
Not one of all the men who have National
i reputation has contributed anything
really new. The impression of all their
work is that you have seen it before.
But there is hope in the work of the
! younger painters, because the exhibition
jis lacking in impressionist imitators.
There is not a work in the whole exhi
bition that sugcests Monet, which in it
self is a promising sign. Of course it may
be that a large quantity of this sort of
stuff was turned in and rejected by the
hanging committee, but even that is a
good beginning. There is nothing like
discouraging those insincere workers.
For some reason the exhibition is wo
fully lacking in marine pictures. There
are hardly half the number of these works
that are generally hung. Carl ton Chap
man hangs the best of these, the picture
being a view of the coast of Maine show
ing a wave breaking over the end of a
reef.
Of the older men, J. G. Brown is quite
conspicuous with a picture of a bootblack
entitled "Looking Ahead." But it is the
same bootblack he has been painting for
years. To give an idea of the way the ar
tists have worked in their old ruts it is
only necessary to state that Bruce Crane
sends a "Rainbow," De Forest Bolmer
"Shadows Over the Marshes," James M.
Hart "A Landscape,-' Charles F. Naegle
â¢'Young Mother," George Taggert "The
Raffle," Thomas Moran "Sinbad the
Sailor," Edward Gay* "Mother Earth."
Frederic Remington "Vaquero," F. A.
Bridgman "Algerian Figure Composi
tion," J. Wells Champney "Nude Figure."
And so one might go through the entire
catalogue. There are very few pictures
contributed that have been painted by
men in Europe, which certainly shows
that artists are meeting with some en
couragement in this country.
STORy OF ITS
FOUNDATION
It was suggested, however, that if the col
lege would become the literary center, and
offer its fine Berkeley site, selected after
years of search and study, the State might
broaden its plan, and undertake to build a
full university. Governor Low thought so,
and said he would recommend it to the Legis
lature in his message, as he was about to retire
from office.
Witu so many things in favor of joining in
the university idea, and such a complication
of difficulties in the way of developing the
college, a majority of the board of trustees
voted to make the transfer, if the State would
establish a university, and the rest of us were
silent for it was of no use to oppose.
The property value of the four blocks in Oak
land with the buildings thereon was more
than enough to pay all the Indebtedness of the
college, leaving the Berkeley site, which in
cluded the hill land, comprising almost the
entire watershed of Strawberry Creek, ample
water rights covering the whole flow of Wild
cat Creek, and a costly topographical survey
by Fred Law Olmsted, laid down on maps with
drawings for engineers, all as a donation to
the State.
Though Governor Haight In his inaugural
message recommended the establishment ofH
university be was no special friend of the col
lege. But in the Legislature the offer made by
the college reconciled differences of opinion,
and it was accepted and the university was es
tablished.
It certainly would not have been established
at that time had it not been for this offer, and
It might never have been in its present com
plete and comprehensive form. It was gen
erally accepted as a reasonable expectation
that in the board of regents first appointed, to
whom would fall the shaping of the Dew in
stitution in a considerable degree, some of the
original trustees of the college would be called
to take part. But thai was not the Governor's
opinion, and through his Influence and by his
authority the board of regents was made to
consist largely of eentlemen unacquainted
with the college and unfamiliar with the man
agement of institutions of learning, but the
most experienced college trustees were all
omitted. The result was that the State lost
entirely its invaluable water rights in Wildcat
Creek; also its possession of the hill land
and the topographical survey of the university
grounds and the prospect for their improve
ment, made after long study by the mos: S*"*
tinguished landscape architect in the United
States. Hence the commendable efforts of the
present regents to retrieve as well as they can
these losses. But in these later years the ad
ministration of the university has fallen into
more competent hands, and it has become a
great institution, worthy of this noble com
monwealth. If it does not aud cannot fulfill
all the hopes of the founders and friends of
the College of California, in many respects It
lar surpasses what we ever expected to see.

Teas Fill In a Busy Week â Preparing for
the Horse Show
Weddings, dinners, luncheons, receptions, i
teas and the cotillon were among the many
amusements society had to choose from dur
ing the week.
Charity also appealed to the gay set, and not
in vain. The Woman's Exchange tea on Tues

The lovers of the beautiful assembled at
Hopkins on Thursday evening to see and to
criticize the product of the local artists' brush.
The two most elaborate affairs of the week
just gone by were the Tallant luncheon and
the Newhal* dinner.
Mrs. Tallant ! luncheon was in honor of
Miss Bernice Landers. Thirty-four guests were
entertained, and the young ladies were seated
at six tables, each one boasting an original and
individual decoration. Mrs. Newhall's dinner
was in honor of Miss Caro Crockett.
The coming horse show is the all-absorbing
topic in social circles. The private boxes have
all been secured by prominent society people.
Belles and buds and matrons alike have all
been busy with the modiste and couturiere,
and marvelous creations of the milliner's and
mantua-maker's art are sure to be displayed.
The members of the Altar Society of the
Church of St. Mary the Virgin will hold a re
ception next Tuesday afternoon and evening
at the residence of Mrs. Frank M. Pixley.
There will be no charge for admission, but an
invitation is necessary in order to obtain ad
mittance to the house. Beautiful articles of
fancy work will be for sale for the benefit of
the society, and an excellent musical and lit
erary programme will be presented by Donald
de V. Graham. Amadee Joullin, Miss Van
Wyck and Frank Lincoln.
The third annual ball of the Delta Sigma
Delta Fraternity was held on Thursday even
ing, in the maple hall of the Palace Hotel.
Dr. Noble, assisted by William Sharp led the

Their many friends took possession of the
pretty home and decorated it with palms, ferns
and migrant blossoms.
Mr. McLaren, superintendent of Golden Gate
Park, sent many choice blossoms to add to the
embellishments.
Song and instrumental music made the
evening pass all too quickly.
Miss Eleanor Coniieii gave several vocal se

The "Gall" jKro\igh an Honor.
Mr. George L. Buun of St. Paul, one of the
greatest whist-players liviug and whist editor
of the St. Paul Globe, is just now engaged in
a Tronrhet-Ansot act with Milton C. Work,
who is a close tecc-Ed :n whist skill, also
whist editor of the Evening Telegraph of
Philadelphia. Their rapiers have a fine edge
and are highly polished. The cause of tnis
little tilt is differences of opinion on the play
of calling for trumps in the original lead or a
call through en honor turned. Mr. Bunn pub
lished a deal in the St. Paul Globe, October
23â one that whs played in the semi-finals
between St. Puul and Hamilton at Manhattan
Beach for the Hamilton trophy. This same
deal, by the way, was played In the match for
the Hideout trophy at Vallejo between Vallejo
and Oakland. Vallejo gained. two tricks on it.
The number of the deal was 40. A Hamil
ton player led the five of spades from the fol
lowing hand:
Spadesâ J, 8, 5
Heartsâ 9, 8. 7
Clubsâ 9,s, 4
Diamonds â 9, 8, 3
Queen of diamonds turned.
Mr. Bunn in the St. Paul Globe says:
The pleyer was compelled to make this singular
lead by reason of tbe very common aversion to the
lead of a tramp from hands containing ihree three
card suits and ur trumps, and because If tie had
l<dthrtopof either of his plain sui s he would
be considered under the am lion "cull through
an honor system" as calling for trumps. In cur
comment on the lead we remarked teat the Hem
ilton device sometimes caused trouble, and we in
tended this Instance as an illustration. The fact
that the peculiar lead caused no damage does not
disci edit the Illustration. We cannot help feeling
that any ("j-Mtni which compels a p ayereven In
very rare cases to make such an opening lead
as was made from the above hand must have
some quite decided advantages in order to Justify
its adoption by whist-play eis.
Mr. Work's answer:
This liana has caused great discussion as to
whether it is not of a type which is numerous
enough to make the Hamilton âºy.-.u-m of consid
ering any irregular lead a trump call when an
honor Is turned doubtful play.
We do not believe, however, that there are half a
dozen A. W. L. players of any ability outside of St.
Paul and Minneapolis teams who would advocate
a trump lead under Mien circumstances, and our
opinion .Is that a si em which requires such a
lead must prove ultimately very expensive, and
if i: was in the hands of any players who had no;
reached the wonderful proficiency of Mr. Boon's
team would be very destructive. _
We _ have seen so many tricks gained by the
ability to call for a leaa. through un honor, that to
abandon the play would seem like deliberately
suffering a handicap. By this we do not mean
that wo approve of the play in all of the cases in
which we have seen it used; like the trump signal
its use Is greatly abused by players of moderate
ability, who desire to show their knowledge, and
then when It fulls to come off in cases where it
would never have been tried by an expert the
play and not the player is criticised.
* While, therefore, we be.ieve In the play in cer
debutantes of the season. Mr. Eppinger is a
son of H. Eppinger, the well-known grain
merchant and a prominent member of the
Concordia and Calliopean clubs. They will re

her friendship.
Mr. Neumith, who is connected with the
1 - irst National Bank of San Jose, is well known

tain cases we have long doubted as to whether an
Irregular lead was tne best way to make such a
can, inasmuch as the fact that the lead is irregular
ha* not always developed by the time the partner
first gets in, and it is absolutely essential to tn â 
success of the play that the. j artner be ab e to
recognize it at once. â¢
To remedy this we have to suggest the following
scheme: Let the lead of a 5, 4. 3 or 2 with an
honor turned be considered au absolute calL
Mr. Buna's Final Reply.
Mr. Work does not feel like abandoning his Â»ys- '
teni. We do not blame htm any more than we i
blame a father for not wishinir to abandon his i
chi:d wuen it Is sick unto ath. But doe* not |
Mr. Work advocate such a radical change in the i
system as to amount to its abandonment? He I
proposes now to make the lead of a 5, 4. 3 or 2
with an honor turned an absolute trump call, and |
to attach no such significance to an Irregular lead !
of a high card. Thia may "cause trouble." There
are a few hundred four and five card suits in
which the lowest card or cards are not higher Uinn
a live. Take such a combination us ace, king,
que-'ti or jack and thiee - small cards, two of
which are lower than a six, and such
suits ps ace ami four small, king and four I
small, queen and lour small. Is it not clear that
there are almost countless combinations from
which the lead or third best or higher would be
ridiculous? Yet the, devotee of the new system
must not lead fourth b st when an honor is turned
if he does not wish his partner to shoot a trump.
There may be cases, too where un honor is turned,
and the leader has DO rive, four, three or two in nis
long suit, lie must then choose the "bottom of
nothing" in order to mace the call.
We do not be ieve that the system proposed by !
Mr. Work deserves a trial. We are surprised that :
so great a p!aver and analyst should advocate such
a change from the old order of things with no
greater object in view thin a trump lead through
the turned honor. "Catch the honor" V- may be. a
pretty game, but the whist-players of America will
not readily all ow ii to supplant the game of whist.

one is to get ready for the battle. How can we
do it? The answer is simple.
STUDY ALL KNOWN SYSTEMS.
T. E. Otis, director of the American
Wh:st League and whist editor of the Newark
News of Nev, ark/N. J., a brilliant writer on
the game, one who is always cracking a nut
that has a lot of good, rich meat in it, say:.:
It is good to stu ly and practice all systems,
leads and piays, so as to be able to recognize at all
limes the style of game the opponents are play
ing: but move all be sure you know ths pame
your partner desires to play aud that he knows
yours. Never play a misleading card. Have each
on- that is laid on the table expreu exactly what
it is intended to convey. At all times make it
easy for partner.
The writer has examined and played over many
I recorded hands of ucLual play, and finds as v re-
I suit tha, seldom or never has the lobj of a same
resulted from the adoption or use of any particu
lar system, and that the losses can almost always
be place 1 10 bad play, noor judgment used in lead-
I ing or returning the leal. Many of the gain* aro
made by the poor r.se the opponents stake of
j thMr trumpi. Horue are always lea ling them
: from length in tiie vain hope of rinding partner
| wiib a long sut: he can niasu. The player who
i makes the b'st usp of his trumps is the one who
â  reserved his strength and refains from leading
I them until he has a dt finite, oliji-ct to accomplish.
I Mo'e tricks are gained or lost by the manner in
| which one ujes his trump sireug'.h than in any
! other vv:i , .
j Wlilsi resembles chess to a great extent becaus?
I of the variety of openings now in vogue, and each
j requires a different defense. There Â«re many
! chess-players of to-day who can rcmemberihe
time wh.le learning the game, to gain temporary
advantage over their opponents they would pore
over the literature on tue subject, study up some
ancient or seldom used opening, and until the
same became familiar to those with whom they
were plavi.ig they were successful. The same is
being done In wbist now.
j It is not to be wondered at tliat all of the new
| systems do find fol owers. 'Ihu vary newness of
the one adopted makes Victories. It is a rare
thing to rind a genuine whist studentâ one wno
takes, weighs and analyzes all plays to learn their
value and defense.
To be considered a player of the first class means
a complete and perfect r 'iidiug of the cards under
any style or system that may be used. It o.ie

The ninth challenge match for the Rideout
trophy took place in the rooms of the San
Francisco Whist Club last Saturday afternoon
and evening. Mr. K. F. F re -Mil in of the Tri^t
Duplicate Whist Club acted as referee and
conducted the match. For quick work this
match beats the record. Forty-eight deals
were played in 4 hours and 15 minutes.
The oakland 3 gained ou nine deals, the San
Franciscos on nineteen and. twenty broke
even. Total score, San FmncUcos -9, Oak
lands 14, the San Franciscos winning by a net
gain of 15 tricks. The players representing
the Oakland team were Messrs. M. Eyre, N.
Halton. S. M. Haslet and A. N. Brown. The
Han Francisco Club was represented by I!. C.
Richards, the veteran captain, and Messrs.
G. A. Singer, A. Moreton and \V. T. Biayden,
the latter acting as substitute for Mr. HuTiiliii.
The Linda Vista Club of Oakland was next
on the list, but owing to tue inability of
President Calley to plisy in the team the chal
lenge has been withdrawn.
The Oakland club is next in order, and will
play on December 12 and 14 if no objections
are offered.
President Bates of tho San Francisco Whist
Club has the right idea of not allowingâ other
things being equal â the same players to con
stitute the team in defendinj the trophy. If
some of our Eastern clubs would pattern after
Mr. Bates more interest would be taken in the
games. What wo want is teiiui work.
Teams of Four.
Milton C. Work, whist editor of the Evening
Telegraph of Philadelphia, says: Four men
cannot get along together successfully in a
longsjrie? of whist encounters unless their
ideas arc in perfect harmony. Ideal team work
chii never exist where one or more players
have adopted "a system" under compulsion,
where one man plays one w;iy and another
follows theories that are diametrically the
opposite, where one man is a star, officious
captain, or coach, who dictates to the others
what should and what shou.d not be done,
where the players are so jealous o f each other
that they watch more closely for a partner's
errors than they do ior tricks, or where a
player is hauled over the coals by his partner
for each mistake he happens to make. We
agree with the Sun In believing the team work
of the Hamilton four, while far from perfect,
is rather above the average, and wo are In
clined to assign for this the following reasons:
(a) Long experience together In match play.
(6) Absolute satisfaction with the system in
use.
(c) Knowledge of each other's ideas.
(d) No "bossing" or oftcious "coaching."
(c) No stars, the four players being as nearly
even in playing ability as it is possible for four
different men to be.
(/) An absence of over-confidence.
Wantedâ Name for a Whist flay.
In the playing of a hand at whist it often
occurs that you plÂ«y a higher and then a lower
card. This play is made to "CRll for trumps,"
to "echo," to "sub-echo," to "change the suit,"
to "reverse" the meaning of the discard, to
show "command," to show four trumps, and a
number of other things, and there is no name
for the play, excepting "call" and "echo" in

In anticipation of a large influx to this City
of visitors from surrounding towns during the
week of the horse show the management of
the Palace have in preparation many novel ad
ditions to their already extensive cuisine,
which will be duly set forth on a handsome
menu card, embossed appropriately, and made
emblematic of the week's festivities.
No prettier sight, no more complete and
modern grillroom is there in all the country
than is the ladies' grillroom of the Palace
Hotel.
The marble court leading from the street to
the grill is flanked by the fresh darK green of
choice tropical foliage and small decorative
palms, boldly set off by the panels of beauti
fully colored and costly marble. Passing
through the portal and on into the grill,
wherever the eye is directed in this elegantly
appointed establishment a new charm-ap
pears, each in itself lending to the complete
ness of arrangement of one of the most mod
ern grillrooms in this country.'
The centerpiece of each table is a silver can
deinbra, holding two waxen candles, each of
which if surmounted by a pink or golden ro
sette. The walls and ceilings are finished in
decorated frieze and colored relief work in
white and gold, and broken by Gothic arches.
Between the arches ate fixed candelabra*.
each beaming ostensibly a dozen candles,
but in reality concealing as many in
candescent lights. The candle pretense
modifies the electric glare and the
light is further mellowed by the alternate
adornment of pink and golden fluffs of tissue.
Through these filtered rays stream forth,
rivaling In tint the first flush of dawn or the
last glow of a summer sunset. .'
The cuisine of the Palace is too well known
to require any commendation. No hotel in
i the Cny sets such a table; no hotel in Lon
don, Paris or New York is its superior in any
way.
The ladies' erlllroom h as found an abiding
place In the hearts of Western femininity. As
a rendezvous for the elite it is becoming more
popular every day, and now that the horse
show is coming on society will undoubted y,
as usual, take possession of the Palace Grill.

MUNICIPAL PAP
Not Enough Offices to Go
Round Among Faithful
Democrats.
Supervisorial Committees Said
to Be Fixed, but Not
Satisfactorily.
â¢Other Party Henchmen Who Are
Thought to Deserve Well of
Their Country.
The nine Democratic Supervisors-elect
have their hands full in trying to make
about fifty offices in their gift suffice for
â  5000 aspirants.
â¢ So great is the pressure from those who
have, or think they have, claims upon
those honored by the people that the
newly elected Supervisors have shifted the
â¢responsibility from their own shoulders
.by sending the hungry applicants in all
. directions seeking indorsements from dis
trict committeemen and others whose
â¢ counsels have been of benefit to the party.
'This wise step has saved the members
.'from being woke up nights by men with
.a ".pull."
As it is now none need apply except
Â»they carry in their inside pockets a list of
names from those in some way connected
with the counsels of the Democracy in the
' City. Whether this is a bluff or blind to
get rid ot the prowlers or nut cannot at
present be ascertained and will not be
Known uutil the ofrl ial chairs are set
round the patronage board next month.
In the meantime there are some candi
dates for office who are not troubling
themselves about obtaining the signatures
of the committeemen in their own or any
â¢ '.other district.
Among them are "Bob" Man, chairman
of the campaign committee. "Bob" will
. have the honor oi prosecuting some of his
party patriots in one of the Police courts.
â¢â¢â¢ ' -John M. Farren, who held the position
â of cle-k in one of the Police couns, will
do likewise during the next two years,
' while Mr. Lynch expects to be the next
â  â  License Collector, giving up his Federal
position in exchange therefor.
William Asmussen, who ran for office
but got left, will contest Mr. Lynch's right
to this office when the time comes.
Wiliiam Allman expects to occupy a
-eat as one of the clerks of a Police court, j
while William Culligan, who has the rep
iitation of being one of the best garden
ers in the City, is pretty 6ure of securing
â  the head gardenership from the board.
Culligan in addition to his experience in
' this capacity has some of the most promi
nent members of the party pushing him
ahead.
Thomas Gallagher, one of Buckley's
' faithful followers, would be content with
being appointed a prosecuting attorney in
Judge Conian's court.
. â¢ The consoling "tip" has gone out that
.Street Superintendent-elect Ambrose will
. : :give the Rainey organization twelve
" . deputies.
Treasurer Block has, it is said, promised
to make such changes in his present staff
of deputies as will let in quite a number
of the hungry outs.
. Sheriff \V helsn has placed a red fish
hook mark opposite the names of twenty
.five deputies, who wijl, it is claimed. Keep
.the sidewalk down after the first of the
new year.
Recorder Glynn is to be heard from
later on as to what he will do on the slid
ing scale.
Proposed changes in the License Office
af'er the first ot next, July will provide lor
a few out of the many seekers for office
among the "push."
The all-important question now at issue
between tne nine Democratic Supervisors
is the fixing up of the committees.
The slate has already been chalked off
with the following for chairmen of the
committees:
Finance and Auditingâ Rottanzl.
Judiciary â Clinton.
Streets and Wharfs â Devany.
Public Buildingsâ Sheehan.
Hospitalsâ Dodge.
Water and Water Supplyâ Morton.
Health and Policeâ Delany.
License and Orderâ Lackman.
Printing and Salariesâ Haskins.
Fire Departmentâ Britt.
Street Lightsâ Rivers.
Outside Lands â Smith.
Whether this programme will be carried
out or not is what is now the topic of those
"on the inside."

â¢ The hall was prettily decorated and
around the large apartment were many
' neatly arranged Btands and booths con
taining articles and re freshmen ts for stle.
The candy table was in charge of Mrs. Mc-
Lenegan and Mrs. Guy Manning, ana the
fancy table was kept by Mrs. William
Frank, Mrs. S. E. Cowell and the Misses
Steinhart, the apron table by Mrs. J. W.
Pew and Mrs. George Smith, and the ice
cream booth by Mrs. Burns and Mrs. Has
icell. The doll's shoe, which was a large
shoe in which little Maggie O'Brien, a
small fonr-year-old inmate of the nursery
was seated, was looked after by Mrs. A. B.
Woodward and Miss Clara Wilson. A
prabbag was kept by Mre. Bretz and Mrs.
Elder, the cologne and stationery booth
by Mrs. Collins. Miss Tuska and the
Misses May and Daisy Collins, the tea

by Mrs. A. J. Stevens and Mrs. E. Lark in.
' A part of the entertainment last evening
" was a serieÃ of Hying pictures under the
direction of John Housman. They were
four pictures from Gibson, the eminent
artist, entitled, "f :nd the girl who had
been kissed in the last ten minutes,
"When Cupid goes out it is hard to get
him back " "An afternoon reception in
Herculaneum," and "Lenten Confes
sions." There were also living posters
and a tableau, "Songs of Love "
There was a good attendance, and the
â  nursery netted a fair sum for its homeless
\ charges. _

Atkinson Suspended for
Conducting a Bucket-
Shop.
Retaliates With Some Racy
Accusations of the Other
Members.
Denies the Charge, and in a Sarcastic
Letter to the Board Orders
His Seat Sold.
Thomas T. Atkinson, a grain-broker,
doing business at 623 Market street and
residing at 1444 McAllister street, has been
suspended indefinitely from the call
board on the charge of doing a "bucket
shop" business, which the board considers
a flagrant violation of the ethics of recog
nized legitimate exchange. On the first
of this month he was- suspended from
membership in the Produce Exchange on
the same charge.
A "bucket-shop," so called, is a place
where deals are made on the differences of
fluctuations in the regular market; a place
where bets are made on the prices of com
modities.
There is no law against them in Califor
nia, but in Illinois extreme measures are
enforced for t!>eir suppression. In Chi
cago tne mail for or from a known bucket
shop proprietor is not allowed to be de
livered.
This is the first case of the kind that has
ever been dealt with here. "Only two other
bucket-shops have, it is said, existed here,
and they, when discovered, quit the ex
change and gave no further trouble.
Speaking yesterday of the case one of
the officers of the Produce Exchange said:
"This suspension means that the man
can neither vote in the exchange nor have
a voice in the call board. If be will
abandon the bucket-shop business we will
reinstate him. Further than that either
way we can do nofhing. We can dispose
of his seat for him and turn him over the
money, but he cannot come and do any
business for himself."
Atkinson, in his own defense, said:
"1 deny that Wheelock & Co. are con
ducting a bucket-shop, as they do business
on the same general plan as tne Produce
Exchange, but on better terms and at
less cost to the general pubHc, as is proved
by the fact that many of the Produce Ex
change members avail themselves of
Wheelock & Co.'s more advantageous
facilities.
"Second, I deny that I am to any extent
a co-partner of Wheelock & Co., and that
their profits and losses to any extent af
fect me. Tnird, the by-law under which
I am suspended is of recent date, partial
and obscure, while the call-board mem
bers, perhaps without exception, violate
in all their transactions for customers an
old constitutional provision. (I refer to
the law on commissions.)
"In conclusion I would simply submit
a copy of my last letter to the board of
directors, as follows:"
Decemocr 3, 1896.
President Gerberding and Directors of the San
Francisco Produce Â£xchangeâ (jKNTLKMKn : I am
in receipt of two letters, dated 2d insi., from
your secretary which appear somewhat con
tradictory, lor the first oae notifies me of my
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
suspension by your honorable body, wblle the
other cites rue to appear to-day, 3d, and show
causu why I should not be suspended.
Kot being particularly robust and hence not
seeking any undue mental strain, I write you
briefly as to my views on the matter. I have
explained that I am not a partner of Whee
lock & Co. â not interested in profits or losses;
;hat I know of no law, human or divine,
which precludes a man and a father from
earning for himself and family the income
necessary to prevent them becoming a charge
on the public, and that 1 fail to see the wis
dom or correctness of your findings in my case.
Yet if you in your united legislative, judicial
and executive powers can see good and suffi
cient reason to suspend me for a trifling viola
tion â if such it isâ of an obscure by-law, and
at the same time condone your own and gen
eral violations of both constitution and by
laws, I can stand even the contemplated dis
regard of equity and justice.
Mv business, I am happy to report, is on a
paying basis, and I am too much occupied to
even attempt to attend your sessions.
Once more I would suggest that you retire
my seat at $800, a moderate valuation, and
thus satisfactorily solve a knotty problem.
Respectfully, Thomas T. Atkinson.
REV. MR. RADER'S VISIT.
He Returns From the South Encour-
aged by the Endeavor Sentiment.
Rev. William Rader, one of the mem
bers of the committee of '97, has just re
turned from a trip to Southern California.
He went in response to an invitation from
the Christian Endeavorera of that section,
and while there addressed a numoer of
large and enthusiastic meetings.
The Southern California district conven
tion, comprising delegates from the fire
southern counties of the State, was in
session in the First Presbyterian Church
of Pasadena, and on Saturday evening Mr.
Rader spoke on "San Francisco '97." He
gave an outline of the work already done
by the '97 committee, and enlarged upon
the scope and spiritual significance of the
coming convention.
The large and attentive audience gave
good indication of the interest in the work
which he represents. Already hundreds
are preparing to come to San Francisco
next year, and a committee or seven has
been appointed tooversce the preparation
in the south. The plans already laid are
quite extensive. The delegation will
divide, part making the journey by rail
and part by boat. Those who come by
steamer are contemplating making the
boat their headquarters during their stay
here, while those who decide to patronize
the railroad are hoping to rent and oc
cupy a large apartment-house where they
can all be together.
The Eastern visitors who return to their
homes via Los Angeles will be entertained
there with true California hospitality.
On Sunday evening in the closing meet
ing of the convention Mr. Rader spoke
upon "The Worth of a Soul," a n d a
packed audience testified to the <iesj re to
hear this Christian Endeavor orator
On Monday evening, by special invita
tion of the ministers and prominent citi
zens of Pasadena, Mr. Rader delivered a
lecture upon "Christian Citizenship," a
subject which just now ia being carefully
considered by Christian people all over
the land.
On Tuesday evening Mr. Rader ad
dressed over 300 boys at the Reform School
at Whittier, which is now nnder the
shadow of a great scandal. After his ad
dress Mr. Rader was shown through the
entire institution, including the depart
ment now under investigation.
He will tell about what he saw there on
Tuesday evenine at the meeting of the
Men's League of the Third Congregational
Church.
After visiting and addressing the
Friends' College" at Whittier, Mr. Rader
returned home, abundantly satisfied that
Southern California will be well prepared
fcfr her part in the great convention of
1897, and that she will maintain the repu
tation of our fair State for open-handed
hospitality.

FROM GREATER NEW YORK
/\ Budget of Interesting NeWs Qossip
/\bout the California Colony in the
Eastern Metropolis
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. I.â Twenty
years ago New Yorkers had the joy of
looking out upon a snow-clad world every
Thanksgiving day, and the country clubs
were busy entertaining city friends who
ventured through the storm of snow.
Those were the days of real mincemeat,
real open-faced pumpkin pies, genuine
country turkeys and good old hard cider.
What jolly days those must have been
with the
Snowflakes whirlin', whirlin', and the fields a
frozen glare,
And the neighbor*' sleds and wagons congre
gatin' ev'rywhere.
Thanksgiving day was as warm as the
last day in May, and didn't seem a bit like
the supplementary introduction to a New
York winter.
Perhaps the most thankful and happy
man in town Thanksgiving night was Al
bert E. Ca-tle, who had come direct from
San Francisco to meet his brother, Wil
liam M. Castle, and his sister-in-law, who
has had such an unhappy experience
abroad. Though the meeting was fraught
with sadness for them the reunion was a
happy one, and W. M. Castle's first re
mark on touching American soil was di
rect from his heart, "Tnank God, we are
in America again !"
Personal friends of Mr. and Mrs. Castle
say they have both suffered greatly in
appearance since they left here last June.
The bitter humiliation they have so cour
ageously passed through has aged them
cruelly. As they desire to escape all
publicity they have taken up their resi
dence temporarily with friends. Albert
E. Castle is stopping at the Fifth-avenue
Hotel, and will most likely remain here
until something definite is arranged re
garding the advisability of pitting Mrs.
William M. Castle under the care of a
New York specialist. She is a very ill
woman, but the loving sympathy of
friends will aid much in restoring her
health and peace of mind.
Dr. and Mrs. Mart Krotoszyner were
also passengers on the steamship Havel,
which brought the Castles over. It was
a very pleasant meeting for the little
party of Californiana. Dr. Krotoszyner
attended Mrs. Castle during the days she
was ill on the voyage. He aud his wife
will immediately proceed to California.
H. T. Payne, the editor and publisher
of the San Francisco Field Sports, is here
on a pleasure trip, and declares he has
come to enjoy himself and not worry abouÂ£
business of any sort. On Saturday he left
for Newton, N. C, to attend the United
States field heats for hnnting dogs, which
is always an interesting and exciting
event. Mr. Payne will proceed homeward
by way o^New Orleans.
J. E. Harteil and wife passed throusrh
the city last Tuesday on their way to Los
Angeles, their home.
Mrs. Marcelena Jones, the well-known
schoolteacher and authoress, is enjoying
her visit East among friends. She is at
present the guest of Mr. and Mrs. E. P.
Critcher at Mt. Vernon, N. Y. Mr.
Critcher, who for years wa3 connected with
the advertising world ou tbe coast, is
meeting with considerable success here.
John Hill, the veteran real estate agent
of the slope, has about finished his busi
ness here and anticipates an early return
to San Francisco. Though Mr. Hill has
been busily occupied in the settlement of
a large Western estate he has managed to
enjoy his visit in Gotham, as he has many
good old friends here who have welcomed'
and entertained him.
Colonel A. W. Jones of Monterey is a
familiar figure down in the busy sections
of Wall and Broad streets, attending to
the development of his Western railroad
scheme. The colonel hopes to return to
California in time to spend the Christmas
holidays.
R. Eloesser, the Eastern buyer for Rey
nemann & Co., is stopping at th<> Plaza.
It is twenty -five years since Dr. J. Cln
ness left New York. Last Sunday he and
his good *wife arrived from Sacramento
and registered at the Grand Hotel, since
whicb time the doctor has been trying to
seek out old landmarks and familiar
faces. "They are all gone," he says, and
consequently a loneliness possesses bis
heart. Dr. and Mrs. Clnness will visit
relatives in the South before returning to
California.
It must be an appalling sensation to old
time New Yorkers when, after years of ab
sence, they return to find that the "great
city" has actually been giving way to the
improvements and advancement which
Western "nerve" and Western "push" al
ways inspire. It has been a struggle for
the true old Knickerbockers to part with
their tumble-down landmarks and pnt
away their fossilized customs; but they
are doubly repaid, because now in their
places stand magnificent hotels, substan
tial business blocks and rows of comfort
able apartment houses and private
dwellings. New and handsome cable-cars
speed along the tracks where, a few years
ago, slow and uncomfortable horsecars
jogged noisily. The theaters are beauti
fully decorated and brilliantly lighted,
and even the lovely women are becoming
more lovely by removing their "picture
hats" and "Imported bonnets.'' New
blood has been infused into the stagnant
veins of New YorKs phlegmatic exist
ence, and the fever for improvements is
cropping out in every part of town. Wit
ness the smooth asphaltum carriage drive
which is being laid on "Fifth avenue.
Of course there is much cruel complaint
in regard to the torn-up streets and the
laying of new and larg9 sewer-pipes, but
that is nothing compared to the pleasure
the citizens in years to come will enjoy
when they ride over the even roadway.
Farewell ye square, gray, basalt blocks!
Many a poor patient horse has found his
slender legs grow stiff and big-jointed
over thy treacherous surfaces. Many a
strong man and woman have cultivated
sensitive and shattered nerves by the
shaking up they have received traveling
over you! Farewell, the futare holds
naught/or you!
Eugene R. Gregory, ex- Mayor of Sacra
mento, has spent the past six weeks in
Boston, Mass., where he has been engaged
in placing an immense Western mining
property. He returned to New York some
days a_-o. His young son is here with
him. It must be encouraging to Califor
nians to know that their mines and their
wonderful products are being sought after
by the whole world of speculation and
commerce.
"During the coming year thousands of
Easterners will take up their permanent
residence in California." So said a very
Wealthy and prominent San Franciscan to
me the other morning. He ought to
know, because he keeps his fingers on the
public pulse constantly.
Mrs. J. 08. Gunn and daughter have
returned from their visit in Maryland and
are stopping at the Fifth-avenue Hotel.
They will soon start on their homeward
journey. Mrs. Gunn will stop eu route at
Cleveland, Ohio, to visit her old friend,
Mrs. W. N. Lamprecht.
Mrs. Lamprecht was Miss Emms Pear
son, the charming daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. VV. H. Pearson, and though she has
not been on the coast in years she has a
host of loving friends in California who
will never forget her.
On Wednesday F. George and wife of
San Jose arrived and registered at a down
town hotel.
B. E. Carl and T. Newton, of San Fran
cisco, are in town.
G. W. Rumble of San Diego reached the
city on Thursday. His visit is of a strictly
business nature.
New York hotels have been packed fnll
ever since the election; in fact, many of
the more prominent hotels have been
obliged to refuse accommodation to guests"*
on account of having no room left. The
bonifaces are reaping a harvest and the
most astonishing rivalry exists among the
fraternity. It reminds one of the old
country storekeeper in Maine, who, when
asked if he were going to attend the
funeral of a business rival, vigorously re
plied: "No, b'gosh; I hain't got time; bat
I approve of it."
Moody and Sankey, those magnetic re
vivalists, are setting lower New York wild
with religious enthusiasm. The revival
meetings at Cooper Union are packed to
overflowing each day. Down on the
Bowery men and boys are whistling
"Hold the Fort," "Pull for the Shore,
Sailors," and "Almost Persuaded."
Up in the windows of the crowded tene
ments women and children are singing
"Beulah Land," "Onward, Christian Sol
diers," and "Where Is My Wandering
Boy To-night?"
There is a pathos in it all, and those
who might wish to scoff could spend their
time better in a silent prayer.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Sixth street did herself proud.
Let us have a crusade against the cobble
stones.
In all your plans for Christmas remem
ber charity.
Read our advertisements and learn
where the bareains are.
Congress opens up the floodgates of poli
tics to-morrow, but to-day you can rest.
Cleveland has less than three months
more and then comes the innocuous des
uetude.
The art exhibit will make the week
lovely and the horse show will give it
liveliness.
Which will be the next section of the
City to celebrate its improvement by a
festal night?
The blizzard season has abated a little
;n the East, but the tourist tide has started
and won't turn back.
The man who makes investments in
California now will get in on the ground
floor and rise with the elevator.
The railroad company ought certainly
to join the progressive movement on Sixth
street by improving the car service.
Now is the time to begin looking for
California novelties to make a merry
Chriitmas for your Eastern relatives.
San Francisco has more improvement
clubs and more things to improve than
any city in the Union. She's all right.
The fight for the speakership of the
Assembly this winter will soon be lively,
li.c contestants are getting into the ring.
England apologizss for not helping the
Armenians by explaining that she has a
greater call from humanity in the Soudan.
It would not hurt the Pacific roads much
if they lost the funding bill, but it would
hurt California a great deal if they won it.
McKinley has the satisfaction of know -
ing that Congress will occupy the atten
tion of some of the statesmen from this
time on.
When you have made up your mind
what you want for Christmas just read
our advertising columns and you will find
where to get it.
The voting machines tested in the East
were hardly more satisfactory than the
old-fashioned political machine. They
did not count right.
People who cannot afford a luxurious
Christmas can enjoy themselves looking
in tne shop windows and seeing how
many things there are they don't want.
The report of the Secretary of the In
terior shows that public land is getting
scarce in this country, so now is the time
to get yourself a ranch and hold on to it.
Now that California has put forward ten
men as candidates for a position in the
Cabinet, the East will begin to understand
something of the extent of our resources.

WITH ITS OWN PETARD.
The Examiner was hoist with its o^n
petard yesterday morning In a most awk
ward but highly entertaining way. It un
dertook with characteristic impudence to
shift its established reputation as Monarch
of the Fakers to other shoulders, with the
result of fastening that reputation all the
more firmly upon its own. In an editorial
article entitled "The Airship Nuisance,"
which opens with the appropriate confes
sion that "Fake journalism has a good
deal to answer for," the Monarch of the
Fakers presumes to take The Call to task
for publishing the news upon the subject
of the airship. It charges The Call with
a "prolonged attempt to humbug the
community," and describes those who
have testified to having seen the stranee
lights and other indicia of an aerial trav
eler as "practical jokers or unbalanced
enthusiasts." It derides the whole sub
ject as a "silly craze."
While engaging in tnis sort of drivel
editorially the Examiner locally delivered
itself over to an already exploded airship
fake of the rankest kind, devoting* page
or more to the congenial labor of giving it
the appearance of truth. In the headlines
and body of the article it describes the
Twin Peaks contrivance as flying, and in
a half-page illustration depicts it and the
man who it states fiew in It. That the
Twin Peaks airship was a clumsy fraud it
only required daylight to discover, and
the fact that it was such was known
about town at least twelve hours before
the Examiner went to press. In fact it
was just such a fake as led many people to
believe it to be of that newspaper's own
devising. It is evident that in thi 3as in
several other more or less important re
spects the right hand of the Monarch
knoweth not what its left hand doetb.
By a bappy coincidence The Call was
enabled to supply yesterday another apt
example of the duplicity of Mr. Hearst's
organs in the matter of news. The New
York Journal of last Sunday devoted an
entire page to the California airship, giv
ing a large cut of the vessel passing over
Sacramento, with a long descriptive arti
cle under such headlines as "A Working
Airship Seen on the Pacific Coast," and
the like. The body of the Journal article
contained the statements of many wit
nesses to the phenomenon, with the re
peated assurance that they were persons
of unimpeachable credibility and good
repute. The article was evidently sent
to the Journal from the Examiner office in
San Francisco, and our "deadly parallel"
proved that it was written at the very time
when the local faker was casting all sorts
of ridicule upon the idea of an existing
airship, and was asserting that alleged
observations thereof were had in sus
picious proximity to breweries, and were
made by those who had been viewing the
heavens "through a glass darkly," so to
speak.
The Call has carefully abstained from
the expression of any opinion regarding
the existence or non-existence of an air
ship, and intends to continue so to do
while the subject remains in its present
condition of doubt. It desires to submit,
however, the following proposition to
candid minds. If in its airship stories the
New York Journal was indulging in an
unwonted approach to the facts, has not
the Examiner been willfully keeping itself
at quite a distance away from them? It
may be remarked incidentally that there
is nothing unusual in this, for the reason
that the Monarch of the Fakers could not
well expect to sustain its reputation as
such without being watchful to have the
width of the continent between itself tnd
the truth.
Without in any way deciding whether
the stories of the airship are true or false,
let the impartial reader consider the rela
tion of Mr. Hearst's two newspapers
toward it, by the light of each other. The
Journal of last Sunday declares that "a suc
cessful airship has been buiu. " The Ex
aminer of yesterday asserts that "It has
been manifest for weeks that the whole
airahip story is a pure myth." The
Journal repeats that "The testimony con
cerning it seems to be unimpeachable."
The Examiner insists that its alleged ob
servers are "practical jokers or un
balanced enthusiasts." The Journal re
iterates that the truth of the story "is
testified to by so many reputable citizens
that there Beems to be no reason to ques
tion its accuracy." The Examiner assever
ates that any paper which publishes such
a "persistent falsehood" is attempting to
"infect its readers with a silly craze.''
What do the public think of this exhi
bition of deliberate double-dealing on the
part of the two newsnapers whose owner
is Mr. Hearst? What do people who be
lieve in truth and decency the country
over think of Mr. Hearst anyway? From
the above revelation of his right to the
title of "Monarch of the Facers," it must
be evident that he has missed his voca
tfon, and that instead of posing as a
journalist in two cities he ought to be
engaged in making grimaces, singing
ballads, shuffling cards, or selling gew
gaws in the side-show of a circus or the
byways of a country fair. A3 King of the
Gypsies and Monarch of the Fakers Mr.
Hearst is an immense success.
SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.
At the in vitation of William J. Buch
anan, United States Minister to Argen
tina, a delegation of twenty manufacturers
left this country last May and made a trip
to Bouth America for the purpose of see
ing what could be done to promote Ameri
can trade with the countries of that conti
nent.
The delegation on its return made an
exhaustive report which has attracted
considerable attention in the East and is
of as much interest to California as to
that section. It shows that the condition
of our trade with South America is de
plorable. We are sending to the markets
of those countries only a small portion of
the goods demanded there, while the
English, the Germans and the French are.
profiting by our neglieence.
The people of South America. It is said,
are, with the possible exception of those
of Chile, more favorable to trade with the
United States than with Europe. They
prefer our manufactured goods to those of
European make when they can be had on
equal terms; but while we have madÂ« no
efforts to supply their markets the
Europeans have done everything to obtain
them, and as a consequence, while the
European trade is increasing our com
merce with that continent has declined
nearly 87 per cent inside of thirty years
and its course is still downward.
The first step in the direction of ob
taining South American trade is the im
provement of our communications with
those countries. We must have more
steamers or we cannot have more trade.
From the report of the delegation it is
evident that some effort will be made to
procure Government aid for lines running
between Eastern seaports and the Atlantic
coast of South America from the next
Congress, if not this winter, and it be
hooves the manufacturers and merchants
of California to be equally vigilant in en
deavoring to promote lines from the
Pacific Coast States.
It is certain the development of our
trade with South American countries will
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
be one of the most important problems to
be dealt with by the incoming adminis
tration. President McKmley can be
counted on to carry forward the great
work begun by Secretary Blame under
the administration of President Harrison,
and we can look for a speedy re-establish
ment of reciprocity treaties when he
comes into office.
These treaties, however, will not be suf
ficient to secure us the markets which we
desire. The one thing essential to com
merce is shipping. It is that which we
must revive if we are to reap any benefit
from commercial treaties. Other nations
have been liberal in promoting their com
merce by the up-buildine of an extensive
merchant marine and the United States
must either follow the same course or
abandon the field even in our own hemis
phere.
SIXTH STREET.
The rejoicing last evening by merchants
and property-owners on Sixth street in
celebration of what they have accom
plished in the way of improving their
thoroughfare was one in wtoieh the whole
City can feel more than ordinary satisfac
tion. The subject to which the public
spirit of the progressive men on that street
is directed is one which concerns us all
and in which all are benefited by every
forward step which is taken.
Almost every street in the City needs
improvement of many kinds, but this is
particularly so on those great thorough
fares which lead from Market street south
ward. The streets of that section of the
City have been neglected even more than
those elsewhere, and yet none more surely
need to be put into the best possible con
dition.
When the coast road is completed, the
main thoroughfare of travel between Los
Angeles and' San Francisco will b* along
that line. The majority of tourists to the
City will then arrive at the Fourth and
Townsend streets depot, and the thorough
fares leading therefrom will constitute the
main entrances by which visitors will
reach the hotels and the business center
of the City. All of those streets, there
fore, should be out in good condition, and
Sixth street merits an early attention to
its needs by reason of the fact that its
merchants and property-owners have done
Â»o much themselves to make improve
ments.
It certainly would not be asking too
much of the street railway company to
equip Sixth street with a better streetcar
service. The company should take part
In the work of improvement and do its
proper shate to complete it. Sixth street
has a great future before it, and the car
company will lose nothing by co-operating
with its merchants in making it as speed
ily as possible ona of the most attractive
thoroughfares in San Francisco.
The fact that so much remains to be
done does not detract in the least from the
excellence of what has been accomplished.
The enterprising, public-spirited men who
by their own efforts have done so much
for the street have set a good example to
the whole City, and were fully justified in
making their accomplishment the occasion
of general rejoicine.
THE ART EXHIBIT.
The winter exhibition of the San Fran
cisco Art Association which has just
opened consists entirely of the work of
California artists, and the State may well
be proud of the abundant evidence of local
talent with which the walls of the Hop
kins Art Institute are now beautified. The
display is not quite equal in numbers to
the one last spring, but is considered fully
equal in the general fineness of the work
manship to the exhibits of previous sea
sons.
It is part of the policy of those who are
fostering art by means of these exhibi
tions to permit no retroeression among
the artists. The man who has shown him
self capable of finer work must continue
Km come up to the standard set by himself
or else his pictures will not be recognized,
even though they fully equal those of
some beginner whose first efforts find a
place in the exhibits. By such rules the
tyros with splendid possibilities are en
couraged to develop what is in them and
those who have reached a large measure
of success are compelled to regard their
.achievements as but the starting point for
new efforts.
It is usually considered that a new coun
try will be too much occupied with the de
velopment of its material resources to ac
complish much in the fine arts, and if
we are to regard California's present per
formance as but the promise of futurs
work, then we may well expect that we
will have artists who can equal tho great
masterpieces of Europe. Caiifornia is a
land so picturesque that if, as many be
lieve, this young Nation is destined to de
velop a higher civilization in all ways
than the world has ever seen, it is proba
ble that amid these mountains and in this
atmosphere of fog and sunshine will be
nurtured the new masters who are to sur
pass the old.
The exhibit sen on the walls of the
Hopkins Institute gives ample encourage
ment to these sanguine hopes. It must
be borne in mind, however, that the suc
cess of art depends not altogether upon
the skill and industry of the artist It is
in a large measure dependent udoii the
general culture of the community in
which it is curried on. The winter exhibi
tion affords a good opportunity to the
people of San Francisco to advance them
selves in that culture, and it should be
made use of to its full extent.
TRUSTS AND TRADE.
The weekly review of trade Dy R. G. Dun
& Co. states among the reasons for increas
ing confidence in the coming of better^
trade conditions that two of the largest
combinations in the country, by which
the iron industry has been retarded, have
been abandoned and that there are reasons
for believing two others will soon share
the same fate.
The expression of this opinion on the
rjari of a well established commercial
journal shows that the belief that trusts
and combinations of a similar nature are
injurious to business is not confined to
farmers and consumers. Commercial men
themselves recognize the evil of such or
ganizations and count it a good thing
when they go to pieces.
It is worth noting, moreover, that Dun
& Co. regard the abandonment of these
combinations as not only a sign of the
coming of better times, but as a proof
that better times to bomo extent are
alread> oere. The Review says: "Such
a state of things within a month after the
election suggests that these organizations
formed when depressed business failed to
support all the works in existence are not
expected to survive a general revival of
ample demands lor products.* l
This means that trusts are the outcome
of hard times and not of prosperity. It
is a complete refutation of the oft-repeated
assertions of the free-traders that such
combinations are caused by a system of
high protection. It is under protection
that we are most prosperous and therefore
least liable to have business disturbed by
the organization of trusts to crush out
smaller men and monopolize the markets.
The return to prosperity promises, there
fore, to have good results in more ways
even than were expected. By making
better markets for all producers it wiil re
move all inducements to form trade com
binations opposed to the general welfare.
Good trade and trusts are opposing factors
in the problem of industry. We have had
hard times and trusts and now we are to
go forward to better times and fair com
petition.
The Faker Rebuked.
News Letter.
The practical rebuke of business men to W.
R. Hearst for his disreputable style of journal
ism pursued in the New York Journal and the
San Francisco Examiner is finding expression
in the withdrawal of financial support to his
papers. It is said that the sales of the Police
Garette and similar papers have sadly fallen
oft since Hearst took charge of the Journal and
began editing its cartloads of libelous scandal,
declasse articles and scurrilous stories. It i 3
also announced that Willie has sunk two mil
lions of his mother's fortnne in the unsuccess
ful effort to establish his metropolitan sheet,
and the end is not yet. Its present monthly
logs is said to be $40,000. Merchants, large
advertisers and corporations, whose legitimate
interests are the subject of daily attacks, nat
urally withhold their support from Mr.
Heart's New York paper, and the same
state of affairs is noticeable in the manage
ment of the Examiner. Its attitude in the re
cent election campaign has cost it many ad
vertisers and thousands of subscriber*. The
loss of its expected annual retainer of $30,000
from the Southern Pacific was a blow irom
which it has not yet recovered, and that expe
rience, it is said, has been repeated in more
than one quarter. To meet monthly deficien
cies in its profit and loss account, the Exam
iner has had recourse to the generous policy of
making its employes pay the penalty of its
owner's mismanagement. Salaries in the
Mission-street editorial rooms have been cut
right and left, and each reporter has now to do
the work of si_ at one-third of bis former
wages. Retrenchment in every department
continues to be the watchword of the Exam
iner. A few weeks ago Hearst endeavored to
curtail the expenses of his news service by a
little scheme which did not work. He threat
ened to start a new evening paper in San
Francisco if the atternoon papeis now in the
field did not join his news syndicate and so
lessen ita coÃt to Hearst. The bluff did not
work, the Bulletin and Post refusing to "stand
in" on the Hearst news bureau scheme. The
"Evening Examiner" proved to be as visionary
as most oJ Hearst's schemes. The dethrone
ment of the self-crowned "Monarch" is now a
part of the history of Pacific Coast journalism.

HE THOUGHT HE HAD GREAT
ODDS
Winnlngton Post.
A McKinley man in Cleveland wagered with
a Bryan friend $100 to a cent that New York
would give over 150,000 plurality for the Re
publican candidate. A condition of. this ap
perently great odds was that if the McKinley
man won he should receive an additional
cent for every vote In the plurality above
150,000. McKinley's plurality In New York
was over 266.000. The man who had offered
the odds of $100 to a cent therefore wins by
the terms of his wager $ 1160. The Bryan man
when he drew his check lor the amount said
it was a bunco game, but any man fool enough
to get caught like that ought to pay for it.
PROSPEROUS FARMERS.
Philadelphia Record.
It appears that 72 per cen c the farms In
the United States ara fr ',irom mortgages.
This is a fact, and a gratifying and rose-colored
fact, which "knocks the stuffing" out of many
loud and long-winded harangues. If further
inquiry should be made it would doubtless
be discovered that in a majority of instances
the mortgages on the 28 per cent of mortgaged
farms represent money borrowed for improve
ments. The American farmer sometimes has
occasion to growl; but, take him for all in all,
tie is the most prosperous tiller of the soil and
the most Independent in the world.

Losing and Gaining a Dayâ J. H., City.
There are 360 degrees of longitude in the
entire circle of the earth. As the world ro
tates on its axis in twenty-four hours, one
tweuty-fourth of 360 degrees, which equals
fifteen degrees, corresponds to a difference of
one hour in time. Imagine a ship sailing from
New York eastward. When it has reached a
point fifteen degrees cast of New York the sun
will come to the noon line, or meridian, one
hour sooner than at New York. When it has
reached to 30 degrees of longitude east of
New York it will be noon on shipboard two
Lours earlier than at New York, and
so on, until when it is 180 de
grees east of that city it will be
noon on shipboard twelve hours earlier
than at New York. Imagine a ship sailing
Irom New York westward and it will be easy
to comprehend that every 15 degrees sailed
westward there will be a difference of one
Hour later in the time of the sun's coming to
the noon line, and at 180 degrees
west of New York it will not be
noon on the ship until twelve hours
after it was noon at New York. If the two
ships meet at this point the one will have
gained twelve hours and the other will have
lost twelve hours, and if there were no
rule of navigation to regulate their calendars
one crew would insist on calling the time noon
of one day while the other would insist on
calling the time the noon of the day before
or the day after. Tne rule of the calendar
makers arirf all navigators is to drop out a day
for the day lost when the ship crosses the one
hundred and eightieth degree of longitude,
sailing westward (that is the one Hundred
and eightieth degree from Greenwich,
near London), and to add a day to
the week or double the day on which
they reach the same degree in sailing east
ward. When a ship sailing eastwnrd reaches
the 180 th degree on Wednesday that day and
the next day is called Wednesday. When a
ship comes to this same meridian, sailing
westward, on Wednesday, instead of calling it
Wednesday, it is called Thursday. The one
ship has two Wednesdays in a week and the
other has a week without any We inesday.

LITTLE JOURNEYS TO THE HOUSES
OF GOOD MEN AND GREAT.
I'nder this somewhat ponderous title Elbert
Hbbb&xd has given us a more than usually
readable series of sketches of various nota-
Kes. "Little Journeys," he tells us in his
preface, does not purport to bo a guide to the
places described, nor a biography of the char
acters sketched.
They are something greatly better than
either ot these, however, albeit Mr. Hubbard
does not tell us so. With a rare, happy appre
' elation both of what to say and what to leave
. outbid, he has given us in each "Journey"
' , the record of a beautiful day spent in haunts
jnade sacred or historic by the residence
among them of "Some good man and great."
George Eliot, Carlyie, Ruskin, Gladstone,
.. . Turner, Goldsmith, Shakespeare, arc among
. â¢ the dozen great ones whose homes and haunts
'â¢ he visited, aad he has done that dillicult
â¢ â  thing, given us a fresh, pleasing, spontaneous
â¢' â¢ impression of each of these. It is largely this
â .'â¢ \ -unwearied, simple seeing of things and think
:.. . .ing about them that constitutes the charm of
';.'.. Mr. Hubbard's book. It is really remarkably
v. ', -free from pose or affec'ation, and his essays,
.'â : ; .deÃpite an occasional regretable let down in
; â¢â¢-"style, are characterized by good taste and the
- discernment of a genuine lover of books. Mr.
.{'.;. iHubbnrd is an enthusiast, but is withal a
..â philosopher as well, and all that he has to say
'â¢; â -'â is tempered with a certain fine good humor
.:.l.hat makes him the pleasantest of guides on

wards. Rand, McNolly & Co., New York.
The fact that this story won a $10,000 prize,
for which there were 816 competitors, is a
strong recommendation. Many people will
be curious to read it just to see what manner
of story was decided by literary experts to be
the best out of so many hundreds. An
other matter of special interest about
the book is that the writer is a South
ern man, and tne competition was open to
the world, this because tbe South Is considered
tardy in literary development. Such a story,
however, would have been sure to attract a
wide attention without the fame of its prize
winning. It is a tale of absorbing interest and
in many parts the style of composition is of
surpassing grace. It is a story which may
Lave a lasting place in literature because of
its value to future historians. It is
a vivid description, by a talented man, of a re
markable transition period in this country's

This is a collection of good short stories,
some of which have been prize winners. The
one called "The Takin' In of Old Miss Lane,"
won the $500 prize from McClure's Magazine,
and the "Mother of Pills" was awarded the
prize for the best original story in "Short

Lane" is a fine sketch of human nature, told
with great brevity. It shows how kindness
can be mixed with carelessness or thoughtless
ness About the good we can do that lies right
around us. In this little tale, Mrs. Bridges is
talking about how the law ought ro take hold
of some people who are not acting kindly
to a poor old woman In their neighborhood,
but it takes a deal of suggestion from her
daughter and a whole day and night of think
ing before it comes home to her that she can
help the old lady herself.

IRISH PROGUE.
RING O' BUSHESâ By Shan F. Bollock. Btone
<fe Kimbali. New York. Price $1 25. For sale by
Doxey, Palace Ho.el, City.
The Ring o' Rushes refers to a circuit of
Irish country which is graphically described
in the prologue of the book. This circuit is
the scene of a series of tales told largely in
Irish brogue, which gives us an insight into
the old country life of the Hibernians. One of
these tales, called "His Magnificence," de
scribes the return to his mother country of a
prosperous Chicagoan, whose magnificent-ex
terior failed to hide from the shrewd Irish
woman he had once loved his insignificant
soul. He thought to overawe her with a
show and brag of his newly acquired wealth,
but the girl, who has married a plain Irish
farmer, does not regret her fate in the least,
and with her quick Irish wit, while affecting
to be very glad to see her visitor, makes sport
of his "magnificence." Her untrained chil
dren come home from school and make un
consciously sarcastic remarks, which put the
Chicagoan very much out of conceit with him
self. Another good one, but a sad story, is
that of the "Splendid Shilling." The shilling
is miscalled splendid, for it spoils three lives

liam Doxey, Palace Hotel, City.
In his prefatory note to this little book the
author quotes a Venetian, who says that "hu
manity has always quested after the marvelous
like a hound." Mr. Ross must have believed
this, for he does not hesitate to tell a tale so
extraordinary that it puts his boojc distinctly
on the list of romances. A plain New York
citizen befriends a foreign lad 7 who is visii-
ing there, but is hounded by enemies. She
turns out to be a princess of the house of Ro
magna, with a claim on ihe throno of Dal
matia. The New York man is suspected of
knowing too much about the Princess, and so
he is kidnaped and placed on board a Russian
yacht and carried across the ocean. After a
most extraordinary series of intrigues and ad
ventures the plain democratic cltizan, who has
become the "puppet" of destiny, marries the
Princess.

They tell me money waits for me,
They say I might have fame.

It leaves me robbed of thee ?

in the hours<of the night" ; and, secondly, to
set forth some reasons for an assumption that
no part of life is 'consecrated to nobler or
more important uses than that usually spent
in sleep."
Mr. Bigelow advances the theory'*that men
tal, phyr-ical and intellectual development
goes on during sleepin the same way as it does
during our waking hours. "The night-time of
the body is the day-time of the soul," said
lamblichus, and this sentiment is echoed by
the author of "The Mystery of Sleep," who
further puts forward the opinion that were the
matter of sleep properly investigated it would
be found to be as full of surprises as is eloctrie
ity or any one of the natural sciences.

The December Arena is a good number. It
opens with a well-written article ou "The Re
lation of Art to Religion," by the widely
known sculptor, William Ordway Partridge,
and.closes with another of Will Allen Drom
goole's inimitable short stories entitled
"Sweet 'Laases,' ' in which, as usual, the humor
and pathos are deliciously blended. Within
these limits are to be found valuable papers
on a great variety of subjects, in proof of
which it is sufficient to cite merely the names
of some of their writers: Professor Frank
Parsons of Boston University School of Law;
Edward Everett Hale, D.D. ; Mary A. Liver
more; Lillian Whiting; Camille Flammarion,
the great French astronomer; Eltweed Poine
roy, B. O. Flower, Ellen M. Hecrotin, etc.
Camille Flammarion contr. bates a psychical
romance of great interest entitled "A Celestial
Love." There are two fine portraits of William
Morris and Rev. E. A. Horton.
The main feature of the bound volume of the
Century Magazine, just issued, is, of course,
the conclusion of Professor Sloane's "Life of
Napoleon." In addition to this there are in
cluded two serial novels, one by Mrs. Hum
phry Ward and the other by W. D. Howells, and
a number of first-class short stories and 11
lustraied articles on various subjects. The

Miss Helen Evertson Smith has written a
paper on "A Group of American Girls Early in
the Century" for the Christmas number of
the Ceiitury. It is based mainly upon the
letters and personal recollections of the
â writer's grandmother, who was a cousin of
Chancellor Livingston. The paper gives a
picture of social life in the manor houses along
the Hudson River at the beginning of this
century.
The same house has just issued new editions
of Macaulay's History of England in five
volumes, illustrated with twenty full-page
portraits of. lending figures; bound in red
maroon, corded silk cloth, with leather labels
and gilt tops. The price is $3 75. Bound in
same style and illustrated with full-page
portraits of Gladstone, Milton and William 111
is their new edition of Macaulay's Essuys,
three volumes; price $2 25.
The American Publishers' Corporation has
nearly ready a fine, new edition of the works
of Marie Corelli, ihe popular writer of occult
novels and author of "The Soul of Lilith."
There will be six volumes, illustrated, printed
on fine laid paper, with ample margins, hand
somely bound in a new and ornate style in

An American book called "Naval Actions of
the War of 1812"' will shortly be published
here by Messrs. Oseood, says the London
Chronicle. The writer Is James Barnes, who
is already known for a novel of the American
Revolution. The ocean fights which he now
describes were, of course, waged between the
English and the Americans. This leads him
in his preface to tackle the question, "Does it
do harm to resurrect these old striies?" He
points to the English veneration of Nelson,
and asks whether it implies ill will toward the
modern French nation. The historic fight
between the Chesapeake and the Shannon
makes one of the most attractive chapters in
Mr. Names' book, which is illustrated.
The Macmillan Company of New York have
issued an abridged edition of "The American
Commonwealth," by James Bryce, lor the use
of colleges and high schools. It is intended
as an introduction to the study of the govern
ment and the institutions of the United States,
and has been prepared to meet the wishes of
a number of teachers who rightly think that
"parts ol the complete worn: are either too
difficult for their pupils, or at any rate beyond
the range of their requirements." Written
as it was originally lor the use of European
rather than of American readers, its reception
in this country has been little short of mar
velous, and the fact that it has been necessary
to publish this new and separata edition
containing nearly all the data that will be
required by the average American reader may
be taken as no small compliment to Mr. Bryce's
work. The constitution of the United Sjtates is
added to the present work as an appendix, and
there is, in addition, an excellent index. The
work under review is well printed and bound.

The men are all discussing the horses
and we are likewise deeply interested in
the beauties, but dear! oh, dear! we have
also to think of our frocks, our wraps, and
last but not least of our chapeaux and
bonnets. As a result, witb tbe numerous
social duties that begin to crowd upon us,
we are fairly being rushed to death. Ever
since the arrival of the unusually cold
weather wraps have become subjects of
serious investigation, for several of the ex
quisite toilettes shortly to be worn are of
the airiest of fabrics. Many will spend
every afternoon and evening during
the show at the Pavilion. As a
result smart costumes of varied
sorts will be offered for our critical admi
ration. Numerous gorgeous capes and
cloaks, stiff with embroidery, relieved
with fur and lace, will be commented on.
Some will, perhaps, like the beautiful
model here illustrated, of rich velvet, cov
ered witb an applique of lace which alone
cost a small fortune. The chinchilla lining
and edging it is of the finest quality, most
becoming to a clear skin, bright eyes and
rosy color.
A pelerine in Breitschwautz, also repro
duced by our artist, the latest Parisian
model, received by me. is uniquely ex
quisite in cut and perfect for afternoon
wear, as were also some velvet coats worn
on a similar occasion, very recently, in
New York and Paris. One especially noted,
of black velvet, had a roll collar and re
vers; in the back it fitted tightly, and
each seam opened to disclose a lining of
lustrous sati^p.
It fell straight in front, every seam being
braided with black silk braid. Round tbe
throat was wound a cravat of white surah,
which, tying as it did under the roll col
lar, imparted an indescribable air. This
arrangement of surah is spoken of as the
1830 cravat. An evening cloak, made em
pire style, was black satin lined with white
brocade, with a collar of sable resting
upon a hood of lace caught up into a chou
at each side of the neck in the front and
fastened with white satin ribbon?. The
white brocade lining to this coat was
adorned with a thick ruching of white

satin ribbon with the happiest cf results
when tbe coat was worn open.
Another lovely coat is of a beautiful
brocade, having a ground of cream satin,
upon which are large blossoms and light
airy foliage; it is lined with a satin cov
ered with large grape leaves.
Tbe great high collar is homered with
some exceptionally good white Thibet,
which also edges the fronts. Imagine the
charms cf a long cloak of pale blue moire
brocade lined with ivory Duchesse satin,
which has a delightful zouave of fine gui
pure ecru in tone, edged with chinchilla,
tbe sleeves and lovely collars edged with
the same fur.' Indeed, I often wonder
what women would do without fur, lace
and feathers. They lend an air of soft
ness to the hardest face and impart a
charm that mere words are inadequate to
express when permitted to adorn beauti
ful women. You may smile at my love of
tbe little luxuries of life and of, its beau
ties, but I know that one must pay the
penalty if one understands the pleasure
that can be imparted by a harmonious
blending of colors or by the mere breath
of a delicious perfume, for there are so
many discords on all sides that for most
of us it isjbetternot to dwell on sensibili
ties. Now, if I had written a single line
more you would have believed that Mar
cella intended to deliver a lecture on
'â¢Harmonies in Nature," etc. ; so let us
return to a discussion of our costumes for
the show, as we are assured by tbe best of
authorities that it will be a most brilliant
event, well worthy of tbe bravest apparal.
Gowns for morning, noon and evening
must be considered.
A dress that comes from one of our best
dressmakers is appropriate for the alter
noon, being a coarse black canvas over a
bright green silk. Tbe corselet and neck
band are of a tartar silk. With it is worn
a bolero of black baby lamb, on whicb is
carried out a neat artistic pattern with a
heavy gold cord. I really covet one of
green cloth. Tbe plain skirt has two rows
of inch and a half wide chinchilla.
Throughout tne lining is of a chameleon
ailk, varying from pale blue to a dull rose
and yet again to green. The bodice is of
green velvet, of the latest cut and seems
decidedly long to us. It has a seam on
tbe hips, the basque being pleated at tbe
center of the back, and in front it reveals
a vest of china-blue and white satin, bro
caded all over with rosebuds. The pointed
revere an of it also, and they extend over
*& r~^Â£ f^ =^ > iff..

the bodice, which is hemmed everywhere
with chinchilla. A great hat of black
velvet with plumes and just a touch of
green completes a satisfactory dress. How
well a pretty debutante will look next
week when arrayed in a dark crimson
serge. Encircling the skirt are three rows
of black ribbon velvet, bordered top and
bottom witb chinchilla.
The bodice is made with a bolero, cov
ered with a conventional design in black
velvet. The soft front is of chine basset
work silk. A beautiful blonde will be
equally attractive in a dark-green clcth
frock, made with a bolero of caracule,
showing an applique of ereen satin traced
with fine jet beads. The vest of white
chiSon is made over white satin. A youth
ful matron in a dress of brown-face cloth,
with a zouave of velvet about two shades
darker, will receive many compliments.
Her waistband and collar are of green
taffeta, and a large brown felt hat is
trimmed with plumes that match the vel
vet. I must not forget to add that the
velvet zouave is piped and lined with
green, as are also the deep cuffs. Tbe
sleeves have moderate puffs. All the
gowns I have thus far* mentioned can be
worn during the morning and afternoon,
but in the evening many will be the elab
orate creations worn in the boxes. In
deed, last year the dresses were almost as
beautiful as those to be seen on a first
night at the opera.
J{ Peart-Colored Velvet.
A much admired dress worn at there
cent New York show was of a pearl
colorett velvet. The skirl had no orna
mentation, but the bodice was a work of
art. The soft vest of accordion-pleated
white chiffon fell over ivory-white moire.
This moire appeared to form a sort of
little coat, over which was worn a bolero
of the velvet, edged round the neck and
down the front with costly sable. On the
other side of the fronts ot the coat, which
was made to open widely to show the
vest, were seven gold buttons, each the
size of a quarter, enameled in rose pinks.
In the center of each appeared an odd
black Egyptian character. Around the
waist was carried a deep belt of black
velvet, which was tied gracefully at the
left side. Over the edge of the high moire
collar fell a little rare Ducbesse lace. The
tiny bonnet had a foundation of the gray
velvet, three very full white ostrich featl -
Seienee Obtains a Closer View of tbe Red Planet .Maps
Though at present the planet Mars is
about 52.000,000 miles distant, its com
parative nearness has brought important
results that will awaken renewed investi
gation and discussion during the coming
months.
The sea-green area which has been gazed
on for centuries with wonder as a watery
mam, "an ocean hung on high," seems
destined, like the dark lunar tracts, to be
a topographical paradox, a sea in name
only, traversed by permanent ridges and
furrows that can be identified under favor
able conditions.
Scarcely had the orb ascended to north
ern skies and turned its north polar
regions earthward before the new tele
scope of Mr. Lowell's observatory at
Flantaff was put in use for the study of
the surface details. Tbe object glass,
which has already given proof of its ex
cellence in difficult observations of Venrr,
was, according to the interesting account
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
c r's, and unusually excellent aigrette, and
here and there loops of white velvet. A
single touch of black appeared at one
side.
The gown appeared to be completely
lined with white taffeta and the fair
wearer, a bride of a month, carried a huge
bunch of heliotrope and maidenhair
ferns. This gown was made in New York,
as was also the one in which her sister, a
well-known belle, appeared one evening.
It consisted of a skirt of light blue poult
de sole having a greenish tone. Around the
bottom was a twelve-inch border of deep
green velvet, charmingly embroidered in
tones of blue and green with a touch of
gold. The bodice was a combination of the
silk, the velvet and a good deal of very
old yellow lace, out of which the sleeves
and yoke were evolved. The velvet formed
a deep corselet which was drawn through
a buckle of rare beauty, for the finest of
turcfuoises were thickly set in the gold.
The tiny bonnet worn had a crown of real
turquoises and a sprightly aigrette. This
gown was lined with green and numerous
were tbe frills of lace and silk revealed
when the skirt was siightly lifted. In
front of this pretty girl rested an immense
bunch of the new variety of mignonette.
Imagine another gown from the same
city of lime-green silk and black-dotted
chantilly net. The under slip is of this
charming color, covered with chiffon to
match ; finished with a flat plisse on the bot-
torn. The full black lace skirt is mounted
separately with two loose chiffon skirts,
besides being entirely plissed, with a nar
row black lace on the bottom. Bands of
the finest jetted lace fall vertically at in
tervals, and an Oriental suggestion in
massing the lace jetted on the top of front
gore was most effective. The composition
of bodice, which was high, was the same
treatment of lime-green silk, covered with
chiffon â the lace in long lines, with two
narrow vertical panels of yellow velvet in
front, showing through jet interstices.
The ligbts and shadows gained by this
veiling give the pleasure we derive from
color transfused in pottery or enamel, and
therein lies tbe real art instinct.
Numerous will be the skirts of white
watered moire and poplin worn with chic
waists of tulle lace, and chiffon surah
beauties have been sent home, and I have
seen a red one, a green one and more than
one in white, pink and blue, but their
charms 1 cannot dilate on, having been
sworn to secrecy. I wonder if we will see
any of the new boas ; tbe latest fad is to
by T. J. J. See, recently published, con
structed from disks of glass that were ab
solutely flawless. Witb a diameter of 24
inches, it has a focal length of 21 feet,
while the mounting is such as to insure
the utmo3t stability. With this powerful
and perfect instrument the supposed
watery tract, long known as the Hour
glass Sea, and also called the Syrtis Major,
received special attention, and Percival
Lowell's own fluent words, in his pub
lished account, will best explain the dis
covery made:
"Unfortunately for the ocean-lovin#the
character of the Syrtis Major must pass
with other charming myths into the
limbo of the past. For the great blue
green area is no ocean, no sea, no any
thing connected with water, but some
thing very far removed from water,
namely a vast tract of vegetation." This
interesting conclusion has not been hastily
arrived at, as in 1894 there were evidences
of solidity and of seasonal changes that
were inconsistent with the ocean theory.
Tbe accompanying illustration, taken
from "Popular Astronomy," of the Hour
glass Sea, the tapering outline of which is
well known to even the occasional tele
scopic observer, shows very clearly the
light and darK streaks whose variations
are the basis of Mr. Lowell's theories.
He classes the markings in question as
light bands and patches and dark lines
and spots. In the beginning of the Mar
tian summer these markings become
visible, under the midsummer sun they
are still more distinct, and later on as
sume mellower tints that are suggestive of
a landscape in the fall of the year. Sohs
Pons and Lunse Pons, the light bands on
the right, have been known for some
years, but that on the left and another
not visible in this illustration have been
recently discovered at Flagstaff. The dark
lines are the most conspicuous of the
canals detected by Mr. Douglas of the
Flagstaff Observatory in 1894, and again
in the present season, though a few were
noticed by other observers previously.
have them match tbe gown, not only in
the identical color, but in minute shad
ings. Truly only a large income admits
of the numerous extravagances whicb are
offered as temptations daily". Before
leaving tbe evening toilettes I want to
mention one I have just heard about that
is the work of an American dressmaker
and is of ivory silk trimmed with ruch
ings of shell pink roses, the sleeves and
corselet being of velvet exactly matching
the roses. On the bodice the flowers are
laid close together without any foliage,
and are veiled with Argenton lace.
Now, concerning hats, bonnets and
toques, we must bave something abso
lutely and entirely new, as last season's
will not stand comparison with the lovely
conceits now being offered by our leading
milliners. To convey some idea of the
marvels to be had in capotes and chapeaux
I repeat for your edification descriptions
of several worn at a marriage which took
place last month. A hat of Nile green vel
vet having a crown richly embroidered in
gold and the aigrette composed of lace
wings incrusted also with gold and a
white "crosse" is alluded to as lovely.
Two choux of pink and Nile roses framed
the hair at the back on either side.
Equally worthy of admiration was a
Marie Antoinette capote in point
d'Angleterre with a transparent crown of
old gold embroidery, an aigrette of birds
of paradise plumes and two choux of
turquoise and velvet studded with tur
quoises and precious stones. Decidedly
novel was a Louis XV toque made of a
velvet in the new tint of lilac rose,
trimmed with feathers that perfectly har
monized and a cachpeigne of white gar
denias. With this was worn a fijll ruche
of glace velvet in the same soft and be
coming tint? of pinky mauvre bordered
with zibiline over a second ruche of cream
pleated chiffon.
A capote a la Charlotte Corday was
unique. Old-gold embroidery formed the
crown and ancient point d'Angleterre the
border. A great row of mandarine velvet
gave a decided cachet to this artistic hat.
A black velvet Louis XVI hat, trimmed
with black plumes and black velvet bows,
fastened with a handsome buckle of rare
eems, was worn with a collet of white
ostrich plumes. The headgear worn by
another guest is described as "a small
begnin in three parts of cream satin em
broidered with Turkish turquoises, becom
ingly finished with a coquille of cream
ribbon, two black feathers and a white
paradise aicrette." The ruche worn was
also of white ostrich feathers. How beau
tiful must have been a "toque Renais
sance," in white glace velvet embroidered
with pearls and large turquoises, with a
Louis XVI bow in white moire attached
with an ornament in pearls and turquoises
and a white paradise aigrette. Some of
these hats I have had reproduced for my
readers.
This season the French women are
wearing their toques right on the top of
their eyebrows. Such a style may be very
Frenchy, but certainly we would not care
to gaze upon ourselves if our hats were so
placed. Chapeaux composed of chenille
plaited with straw are much in demand
Mr. Lowell's interesting and plausible
theory is that Syrtis Major, the supposed
sea, is a tract of land not uniformly level,
bnt belted by natural depressions, through
which the melted polar snows find egress
toward the equatorial regions. The rather
broad and irregular dark streaks that ap
pear in the early Martian summer are due
to the vegetation springing up over those
watered depressions, and later, in the de
cline of the year, these broad stretches
give place to remarkably straight lines,
which, according to Mr. Lowell's interpre
tation, bear tbe stamp of artificiality, and
may be an intelligent engineering expedi
ent for utilizing natural declivities and
and are supposed to be far lighter than
liKe structures in velvet or felt; this, bow
ever, is a mistake, as their weight is con
siderable. A

Beautiful Crjpigtmag Gifts.
Not far from Pittsburg, Pa., the factory
I is established from which is Deing sent
this beautiful ware. It challenges the ad
miration and wonder of all connoisseurs
of rare, uniaue and beautiful glass. Every
one should examine the specimens of Vol
lenden, which have just reached us. In
deed the proprietors of one of our leading
stores is to be congratulated on having re
ceived a consignment, as the manufacturers
have been very cautious in placing the
Voilenden, and I understand that besides
the firm in .this City only Bailey, Banks
& Biddle and Caldwell in Philadelphia,
Tiffany in New York and Burley & Co. in
Chicago have had the pleasure of handling
it, so limited are the number of pieces
made. Positively no mere words can be
gin to express the simply marvelous
beauty of some of the pieces. One alone
is well worth a journey to see, for in the
factory are employed well-known artists
from France, Italy, England, Germany,
Turkey, etc. As a result the decorations,
designs and colorings are as varied as
though the lamps, etc, had come from
these different countries. For example,
one lamp is of a deep rich green color, and
on the stand and globe are exquisitely
painted portraits. Those on the globe are
of Salvatore Rosa, Rubens and Rem
brandt; the portraits on the body of the
lamp are after Vandyck, most skillfully
reproduced by Sigmund Wirkner.
Mr. Hunter, Gazoo Fouii, Albert M. Par
low, William IJ. Morley, George Morley,
Dominco Campano, Edward Zabn and
Frank J. Vetter are among the well-known
artists engaged by the owners of the glass.
The lamps, on whose translucent surfaces
bloom such roses as Queen Mab must
twine for her lovely hair, are extraordi
narily beautiful; on others flatboats, in
which her Majesty might have drifted down
many a moonlight river. The greatest
novelties of all are the incense- burners,
which may be had in vase-sbaped designs
of rarely charming colorings. A liquid
perfume most delicious is slowly burned
in them. One of these esthetic ornaments
was sprayed with the most natural cherry
blossoms I have ever seen. Over another
fluttered birds across a cloudy sky. and a
third was purely Turkish in design. The
vases, bowl 3, etc., indeed every piece,
must De seen to_be properly appreciated,
and before deciding on your holiday gifts
I do advise you all to make a judicious ex
amination of this most fascinating ware.

Fop .Men.
"Him's" latest communications will
cause a little flutter, as he tells this week
about the "stir" made by the reefer, and
although it will never take the place of
tbe frock coat, as some have predicted it
would, still it will be very considerably
worn; sol give you this authority's re
marks concerning the garment:
"The reefer, of which I spoke some
time ago, seems to have created some un
wonted excitement. It is identical with
the three-seamer, the debut of which has
thrown into consternation the London
tailors. After all, what is it? It is only a
jacket with square edges, very much on
making them more effective by construct
ing watercourses through them.
The light bands in the supposed sea are,
then, the uplands parched by summer
heat, outlined by the encroachment of the
watered soil and made distinct by the con
trast between barrenness and vegetation.
The canals and oases, as shown in the
drawing dated October 9, cross both seas
and continents alike; 'but of the latter
divisions this keen-eyed observer reserves
his recent impressions for a later date.
These will be awaited with intense inter
est, as Mr. Lowell's keen-witted infer
ences, as well as his practical zeal in the
cause of telescopic research, give him a
prominent place in the scientific world.
In September, 1892, Professor Schaeberle
of the Lick Observatory announced his
belief that the dark areas on Mars were
land, as the streaks and variation in tint
seemed permanent, while the supposed
continents glimmered brightest when on
the central parts of the disk, in truly
oceanic fashion. The canald and vases
crossing the so-called continents he con
sidered to be the ridges and intersections
of submerged mountain ranges 6ften
duplicated as on the earth.
With these views Schiaparelli entirely
disagreed, but as they were founded on ob
servation and experiment, and are now in
part corroborated by the efficient observ
ers of Flagstaff, they may bring the un
settled state of the Martian land question
to a satisfactory conclusion.
It will be several years before the bright
orb that is the subject of these scientific
controversies revisits the firmament in its
present beautiful aspect. Being the bright
est red star visible, it is easily seen be
tween the tips of the horns of Taurns,
rising at dusfc in the northeast, passing
tbe meridian at midnight at a high alti
tude and setting at dawn in the northwest.
It is now at its mean distance !rom the
earth, and on December 10, being in oppo
sition to the son, will still afford excellent
opportunities for observation during the
coming weeks. Rose O'Halloban.
the lines of the yachting reefer or pea
jacket, but longer and more of a coat than
a jacket. It is also finished in much better
style, and there is a certain entrain about
it. It has been used on several occasions
this summer and autnmn by the Prince of
Wales as a compromise between the in
formal and formal afternoon dress. In
deed, I don't see the cause for this agita
tion. The new square-edged jacket is,
after all, only a very pretty sack coat,
with a bit of suggestion of formal attire
about it. Perhaps it, will take a place in
relation to the sack and the frock, as has
already been occupied by the dinner
jacket. I do not believe men will wear
high hats with it, and I doubt very much
if you will see many of them in the height
of the winter season in New York, unless
downtown or at tbe clubs."
Last August men wore at Newport
lounge suits for calling, garden parties
and even luncheons. Quite a change from
the fashions of two or three years, ago.
Very smart suits are now to be seen of
both blue and black serge, indeed one can
not fail to note them with pleasure and
relief, so numerous are the tweeds. Such
serge suits emphasize a good figure and
have the faculty of not drawing any undue
attention to a bad one. The new "three
seamers" are made of these serges and
such suits when lined in black are certain
ly swell.
This season the most fashionable gloves
come in shades of tans and browns for t!ie
country and when driving the reddish tan
are most correct. Tbe suede vanished at
the approach of winter and they are only
worn for half mourning. Gloves have
longer wrists at present, but one button
only.
Colored shirts, with all around turn
down white collars, will be worn by f well
dressed men all winter with their business
suits, but never will they be seen in com
bination with frock coats, as they were
last year.
The black club tie is enjoying a great
popularity and is worn on all occasions.
The latest trousers are made compara
tively loose from the waist to the knee,
and from there they are tightâ"some
what on tbe pegtop principle."
When the weather is very cold it is a

WrAj Do the Lpst Walk ir\ Circles ?
The question is often asked: Why is it
that a person who is lost, whether it be in
a dense wood or on a prairie, invariaoly
moves in a circle and always to the right?
No satisfactory answer bas ever been given
for this well-known peculiarity under the
circumstances mentioned.
Some physiologists, anatomists and
speculative philosophers claim that the
left leg in the human species is slightly
longer than the right and so takes longer
steps, thus causing a motion to the right
whicb in time completes a circle, if the
mind is so bewildered that it has no fixed
objective point in view. Perhaps tbe real
answer to this queer question lies in the
fact that most persons use their right
hands in preference to their left, and are
accustomed to passing objects on their
right-hand side, and so, unconsciously,
keep edging off to tbe right. On a prairie,
however, where there is nothing in the
way of obstacles worthy of mention, this
cause or reason for walking in a "right-
Handed" circle would hardly hold good.
Does any reader know whether it is a fact
or not that left-handed persons who are
lost make the circle in an opposite direc
tion to that made by a right-handed per
son? â St. Lonis Republic

fripW It Feels to Hold the Jhrottle at 112
Miles ar\ Hour.
This-is the story of how it feels to drive
an Engine at its utmost spe d, gathered
from -the lips of tbe drivers. Various
â¢persons have from time to time related
. their sensations while on board a railway
â¢ -t'r&in traveling at the rate of a mile a
â â minute, but much more interesting are j

co.njpanion, and who turn their backs on

It is one thing to sit in a parlor car and
Â£a<?? at the landscape flying by as if it

: It- is altogether a aifferent matter to look

; : . â¢'Think of traveling at the ra:e of 112
â¢ rri-ilos an hour! Only once ia the entire
b-isTcry of railroads has the feat ever been
tfeccunpfished. The bearers of this record i
u.he 'engine i !*t. that most famous of Ameri
can.: locomotives, and us driver, John
JJeg&r:. It all happened on the tracks of
' tfce. -^>w York Central, between Syracuse
au-i". Buffalo. This is what Engineer
. Ulqcftn says:
â i^Te travel along the rails at the rate of
4);.! miles an hour is as nea: like flying as
â ft-nyfh'inj; I can think of. Wben we got
outside" of Syracuse and began to crowd
; â â¢Â«'Â« Steam we shook just as if we bad been
Bt. sea. I tell you I feit excited as we
gradually put on steam, and I knew we
â¢w-'efeV get ting closer and closer to a point
;b.T ..speed- that had never been passed by
atiy:ehgine. Faster and faster we went,
.:..:iny... .heart beating like a trip-hammer.
â : kii'e country and the towns on each side
' Joi.the track don't seem like anything but
â¢ streaks-. " It seemed to me as if everything
> .â hail gone out of my bead. but just the
..â â â¢â  : :pi9'5 r e"r to watch that steam gauge and to
: . :k-Â£ep" tfacK of that speed. When we
â  ' ;r-eSajpbed the 100-mile-an-hour pace 1 knew
;- al-rrecords had been broken. Old 999 and
. Jpn'a Hogan had gone faster than any
â J and engineer had ever traveled. I
felt a. sense of exhilaration and pride such
â¢as- 1 .never experienced before nor since.
Then came the desire to see what we
really could do. It seemed to me as if I
would almost burst. I saw that every
condition wa*B favorable to a wonderful
run, and I had a good excuse for it, for we
were a little behind time.
"A little more pressure and the engine
jumped forward as if it wereaJive. The
rueb of wind outside the cab was so like
a gale that I felt we must be in a storm.
One hundred and five, six, seven, eight,
then nine and ten miles. 1 began to won
der where on earth we were going to,
whether we ever could find a limit, and I
was so intoxicated with the success that
we had achieved that I made up my mind
to flo all that was possible.
"*At last there came a moment when I
knew we were doing all that we could and
I can't tell Low sorry it mede me feel to
find that limit. We were running at the
1 rate of 112 miles an hour and my hÂ»art
\ sank when after about five miles we had
to slow down to the hundred rate; but
Odd as it may seem I did not realize what
c had been done until we came to a dead
stop in Buffalo, and then it all came over
nie. Say, I wa| as weals as a cat. That
is how it feels to ride at the rate of 112
miles an hour."
The night run of the Empire State Ex
press from New York to Albany is one of
tht: best known and most trying runs out
of New YorK City. This is the star tran
of the New York Central. Nothing must
be permitted to interfere with its progress.
It must be on time. All these things the
engineer ha 3to face when he pulls the
throttle* at Forty-second street, and the
run toward the Harlem River begins. He
knows he must make Irom fifty-three to
sixty-five miles an hour, and that accident
is to be avoided under any and all circum
stances. William Marley makes this run
three times one week and four another.
"Nerve?" said he, when he talked of the
task thatlie accomplished so often. "Why
I haven't got any at all, if you mean the
force that makes you tremble. I guess I
have got some of the other *md or I
wouldn't be running this engina -^n't
mind telling you that a man in this duo'
ness wants to forget all about tbe fact
that he's got nerves. They would only
interfere with his work. On the run like
the one I have, all a man has to do is to
watch his engine and go ahead on time.
When a man is in the cab of his engine
he has eyes for only one thing, and that
is possible dancer. I know that lam al
ways on the lookout for it. and I always
would be, whether 1 was running the Em
pire State Express or a local one only
three miles out.
'There is a sense of responsibility felt
by locomotive engineers unlike that which
rests upon a man in any other business.
The fact that one man is responsible for
the lives of hundreds is enough to make
him careful. On a fast train like I run
the engineer always has that sense of get
ting somewhere quickly.and I can't tell you
how satisfactory it is. Then be always
has the feeling of power. Somehow it
just comes to bim from the big powerful
engine that doesn't stop lor anything.
"When I am running an engine I sel
dom think of what may be on the track
ahead of me. Why, if I should see my
own mother on the rails in front of my
engine, within a train's length of me, I
would know that no power but that of God
Almighty could save her. Once anything
that li\es gets within a certain distance
before the engine it simply means instant
death for whatever it may be. lam sure
that a train going at the rate of sixty
miles an hour could never be stopped
within its length unless it was a much
longer train than the Empire State Ex
press. I never think of the possibility of
an accident when I am on a run. You
see they are not pleasant things to have in
your mind anyway, -these possible disas
ters, and I always figure there is time
enough to think about them when they
come, if come they must.
"When a roan sees what seems certain
death him in the face as he sits
on bis seat in the engine cab he doesn't
feel at all. He merely realizes everything
and just does all be can to avert the
LIGHTNING EXPRESS, 112 MILES AN HOUR.
danger. He has no time to feel at all un
der such circumstances."
One of the old-timers of the Pennsyl
vania is Ned Perkins, who, in addition to
bis other virtues, acknowledges having
been in an accident. "I guess that nine
tenths of all the railroad men in the coun
try have been mixed up in some sort of an
accident in the course of their expe
rience," said he. "I had one once which
took me as near death as I care to go until
the actual end comes. I was running a
local out of Philadelphia on the western
division and Jiad a good fireman, but a
poor engine. She was a cranky machine
if ever there was one, and tbe men in the
roundhouse were always joking me about
tbe 'mule,' as she was called.
"I had been pretty lucky and was con
gratulating myself upon avoiding acci
dents, wben one day my turn came. I
was a little behind time and had just got
fairly started on my run. I was going
alone at a forty-mile speed when we came
in sight of a si^e track. I had been over
that switch hundreds of times and gave it I
no thought, until suddenly the engine
gave a jump and began to pitch and toss

and was a3 if turned to stone. I remember

PACED BY A GALE HE SMASHED ALL RECORDS.
/\ Darir\g Wheelrr\ar\ Whirled irv the JeetK of a Storm j^ides a
Wonderful JMile ir\ Fifty-Eight Seconds.
The bicycle has just proved itself speed
ier than a hurricane. Stanley M. Barrows,
a young Denver rider, is the cyclist who
traveled the fastest mile that any wheel
man over rode â 58 3-5 seconds. A mile in
less than a minute. That is a record which
few limited express trains equaf. Yet it
was proved to be correct by competent
witnesses. It is not often that a wheel
man has a gale or a hurricane act as pace
maker, but (hat was young Barrows' ex
perience, and, odd though it may seem, he
left the pace-maker behind him from start
to finish. I
This happened near Montclair, Colo.,
very near to Denver, on a plain where the
wind had full sweep. The wind always
blows in Denver, and when it decides to
take an extra spurt it's a wind worth
thinking about. It was a wind like this
that was blowing the day Barrows went
out to break the record. If that wind blew
in most States east of Kansas it would be
considered a very respectable hurricane,
but in Colorado it is known as a plains
zephyr. Mr. Barrows has taken the
trouble to relate his experience on this oc
casion and to tell why he made the effort.
This is his story, in his own language, just
i as it was written and signed by himself:
"To the Editor: On the 27th of last
March I rode a straightaway mile in 1:31.
A few minutes after I made the ride M.
O. Dennis rode a mile over the same
course in 1:11 3-5. Ever since then I have
been awaiting a favorable opportunity to
lower the record made by Dennis. On
September 25 a heavy windstorm came
down from tbe mountains west of here
I and I secured timers and witnesses and
went out to the course, which is situated
on a course six miles from Denver. Owing
i to the poor condition of the roads I was
â¢ unable to try for the mile, but succeeded
my mother and then wondered what was
going to become of me if I was killed.'
"As for myself, I thought in the few sec
onds that the affair lasted of everything
that ever happened to me during my en
tire life. Perhaps I skipped a few things,
but it didn't seem so. It was the only
accident lever had, and I don't mind tell
ing you that I never want to be in another.
It did not seem to affect me beyond a
general shaking up, and although I- have
heard of men losing their nerve after an
accident, 1 do not think I did so, for I ran
in riding a quarter in 15 2-5 seconds. I was
satisfied by this performance that I could
get the mile in a minute flat or better. No
vember 2 we had another windstorm and
1 again tried the mile. This time the
wind shifted around to my side just as I
arrived at the course and the best I could
do was 1:221-5.
"On November 5 the wind blew strongly
and direct from the west. About noon
the wind was at the highest, and I se
cured two timers and three witnesses and
went out to the course, which is consider
ably higher than the highest building in
the cit y. The course over which I rode
was about half a mile east of tbe course
which' Dennis used. On the course over
which Dennis rode there is a climb of
about thirty feet in the mile. In the first
half of the course over which I rode there
is a drop of over fifty feet and a climb of
probably twenty feet in the last half. The
road was in excellent shape, with the ex
ception of tbe stretch of adobe near the
half, which was somewhat rough for about
thirty feet.
'â¢I started about 100 yards back of the
beginning of the mile and was under full
speed by the time I reached the mark.
All went well until 1 reached the adobe
stretch, when the jar threw ma out of
the saddle, but I was going at such a rate
it was lor an instant only. My feet were
firmly fastened to the pedals and.it was
impossible for me to be thrown from the
wheel, the only dancer being a breakage
or a collision with some unlooked-for ob
ject. The time of the start was 1:07:31 3-5
and the finish was 1:08:301-5.
"I rode a track-racing bicycle weiph'ng
twenty pounds and fitted with road-racing
tires. It was geared to 120 inches. lam
inclined to think this record will stand for
a long time. Yours, very truly,
"Stanley M. Barrows."
Mr. Barrows only tells a part of the
story. To him the story consists of what
he knew of hi 3 ride as he made it on his
wheel. There is another view, which is
equally interesting, and that is the view
of the persons who saw the race. They
say it was a sight worth going a long way
to see. In their opinion Barrows could
race with a bullet with fair chance of suc
cess. While the ground on which tbe ride
was taken is known as a plain, it ia mere
ly so by comparison, for the course that
Barrows rode is down hill the first half
mile and up hill the second half, although
the gra'ie is not so very difficult. The
tape was laid at each end of the mile, and
Barrows wheeled back 100 yards before he
started on the ride that made him fam
ous.
The wind was blowing a hurricane and
when he went over the tape where Bert
Yardley, the timekeeper, stood he seemed
to have been condensed into a flash. The
stop-watch registered 1:07 3-5. By tbe
time Yardley manasred to get his eye on
Barrows the rider was out of hearing. He
had passed the wind. The hurricane
which should have been blowing him
along before it, could not keep up with
him. Instead of being driven by the
wind he was in reality acting as pace
maker for it and had to meet a lively
breeze caused by his tremendous momen
tum. Think ot beatinjr a hurricane. Was
ever such a feat accomplished by a human
being before? Old Boreas must have
hung his bead in shame.
Before the mam at the other end of tbe
mile realized what was happening, some
thing went over the tape-line in front of
him, and he stopped his watch mechani
cally. When he managed to turn his eyes
down the road to see what it was, he dis.
covered Barrows at least a quarter of a
mile away, apparently pedaling along for
all he was worth. Really he was trying to
stop, but there are easier things to bring
to a standstill than a bicycle that has been
traveling a mile in less than a minute.
Frank C. Wolff, who was the timekeeper
at the last end of the mile, had got his
breath by this time, and looked at his
watch. It registered Â«l:oÃ 15. This meant
that the mile had been traveled in 58 3-5
seconds.
After a while Barrows managed to re
turn from his over-time trip, and found
that he had done what he had hoped to
do, and had broken every record that
anybody had ever tried to make on a
whepl. No one who saw the race was Bur
prised. Not one of them had ever be
lieved such speed was in a wheel. It must
be remembered, too, that Barrows beat
the hurricane, therefore it cannot be said
that the hurricane helped him along. It
over that line a long time after that with
out any accident. Nevertheless, I always
felt a certain sense of relief when 1 had
taken the last car of my train safely over
tbat switch."
These facts show that the life of the en
gineer is never devoid of sensation, for
there is sensation in expectation and both
are included in uncertainty.
All of these elements enter into the life
of the man who holds the throttle, and,
holding the throttle, has in his keeping
the lives of thousands.
is just like that famous 112 miles an hour
run of engine 999 of the New York Cen
tral. Nobody ever believed it could be
done until it was accomplished.
This record of Barrows' was witnessed
by Charles Jnglin, Phillip Snowden and
Louis Snowden, besides tb.6 timekeepers.
It is not official. It never will be con
sidered so. That does not alter the fact
that the record has been made, and
though it may be declared informal and
not to be considered by tbe professional
record breaker, it is, just the same, the
fastest mile that any one ever made on a
wheel.
JYlarvvj Still Speak Qaelic.
A new appointment has been made from
Waterford to the chair of professor of
Gaelic in Maynooth College, Ireland. The
new appointee is a member of the Gaelic
League of Dublin, and was the first editor
of the Archaeological Journal of Water
ford. Tbe opinion is very general that
Gaelic is an extinct language, or one
nearly extinct, and the labors of the
Gaelic Society in New Y< rk to revive its
use have lent some color to that opinion.
Nevertheless, as figures show, the Gaelic
tongue is very tenacious, and, according
to tne last reports, is spoken, though not
exclusively, by 1.000,000 persons in the
British Islesâ 6oo.ooo in Ireland, 330,000 in
Wales, and 220,000 in Scotland.
Though English is the official language
of all these countries, the popularity of
English increases slowly despite the dis
advantage under which those who use
Gaelic labor, that of having no established
grammar and no recognition in an official
way. Gaelic fulfills the colloquial require
ments of the fnrmers and fishermen in the
counties remote from the large cities,
somewhat us tbe Basque language con
tinues to be popular in the northern prov
inces of Spain.
In this country Gaelic has made little
headway, thoueh many patriotic Irish
men have by various methods endeavored
to acquaint others less patriotic with its
advantage*. While the use of most Euro
pean languages has about doubled in
seventy-five years, five times as many per
sons speak Enelish a3 did in 1820.
London's population increases by 70,000
each year.

Mr. Warrineton Baden-Powell, elder
brother of Sir George Baden-Powell, M. P.,
and Major Baden - Powell, who led the
pioneers in the late Ashantee expedition.
An expedition is now being planned, but
whether it will travel under Britsh or
American auspices has not been decided.
The peculiar craft by which it is be
lieved the success for which millions of
money have been spent and many lives
sacrificed will be achieved is to b'
like nothing ever constructed, in its
entirely. It resembles In a degree the
ocean whaleback. The deck covering is of
steel, studded with heavy rivets, the
whole specially drawn and welded with
tbe idea of withstanding extreme tem
perature, the sort that is naturally ex
pected to exist in the vicinity of .the pole.
This is about tbe only resemblance, so far
as any striking feature is concerned, to any
other craft which was ever planned. In
fact, it is noticeable for the many radical
changes and departures from all previous
theories of marine architecture.
At the apex of the bow is a curious
screw, not unlike a series of circular saws.
This ice-destroyer, for that is what it
really is, constitutes the means for forcing
a passage through ice floes which never
could be accomplished continuously and
successfully except by some such means.
As the ship lies in the water this screw
saw is observed as projecting several feet
and partially out of the water. In appear
ance this curious contrivance resembles
more than anything else a huge sorew.
As stated, it has teeth like a saw cut in
the edges of its thread. Tbe shaft or cen
ter of this screw is a massive affair of
steel, pointed at one end so that it may
be operated as a ram. It is the idea of the
inventor to ser.d the craft ahead at an ice
pack or floe under a full head of steam,
with tbe propoller at the stern and the
tcrew at the bow, both working together,
although one receives its power from an
electric engine, while the power of the
other comes from an engine driven by
steam.
The rapidly revolving screw and ram
combined will first crash into the ice im-
BATTLE WITH A BUCK.
I pelled by a power that is tremendous when
I the size of the craft is considered. Then
it will saw and bore its way through the
pack or floe, throwing the ice upward and
backward. It might be thought that the
flying ice and snow would injure or bur
den tbe vessel, and to avoid anything of
this nature a shield has been constructed
which will answer the dual purpose of
withstanding the heavy shocks of the
waves iind the bombardment of flying ice.
This shield is a curved affair, running
from a point just forward from the deck
house backwaid at an angle of forty-nye"
degrees. It is made of heavy boiler iron,
sheets of which are riveted together.
While only built for moderate speed
this craft is especially designed for batter
ing and ramming ice, and its pro
pelling engines, which will be com
pound triple expansion oaes, are to
be correspondingly heavy and power
â¢ful. fully 1500 horsepower. The latest
principle in tne way of fuel will be fol
lowed, and the flame which heats t .c boil
ers will have as its source petroleum.
Well forward in the bow is placed the
powerful engine which runs the ice-crush
ing scr.->w saw. Huge electric motors and
powerful gearing are the characteristics of
this engine, which will only be used when
it is necessary to cut a channel through
the ice. T c electricity is supplied by an
immense dynamo, which is driven by the
main shaft. Below and all round the
electric engine-room are the steel tanks in
which the petroleum is stored. These ex
tend well under the cabin and living quar
ters of tne crew.
In tbe after section of the hull, about a
thud of the way from the stem, is located
the engine which runs the propeller. The
boiler-room is just in front. Storerooms
in which can be carried provisions for
three years and a half and petroleum
tanks occupy the after portion of the ship.
The living quarters of tbe crew and
members of tbe party who accompany
the expedition are amidships, partly above
and partly below water. Here are store
rooms tor delicate scientific instruments,
medicines and articles required for con
stant daily use. Tbe turret or deckhouse
and quarters are thoroughly piped from
the boilers, and thus any degree of warmth
can be maintained regardless of the
weather ontside. A constant supply of
fresh air is obtained in tbe boiler and en
gine rooms, down in the body of the ship,
below the waters' surface, by means of
forced draft, which sends the air down
two large ventilators on either side of the
smokestack.
Tbe steering apparatus of tha boat will
be tbe very best that ingenuity can devise
and money purchase. It will be sa ar
ranged t at th* vessel can be steered from
I any section of the cabin. Still ano'her
! peculiarity of the craft is the odd con
j struction and position of the propeller.
It is set, not at tbe extreme stern, but a
little forward and beneath a sort of pro
jection which, however, is all below the
surface. The idea of this is to protect the
rudder and propeller as much as possible
from icejams, and to further add to this
the blades of the propeller are thicker
than is ordinarily the case and sharper on
the edges in order that they may cut
rather than break any ice cakes wbicb may
come within the sweep.
Marine engineers and explorers alike
are watching tbe construction of this
unique craft with no little interest. Many
opinions have been advanced regarding
the possibilities ol this vessel. The in
ventor, however, is confident that he has
at last reacned a solution of that most
puzzling problem which has occupied the
attention of scientists and navigators for
centuries.
It is considsred by all odds the most
novel method of reaching tbe pole that
was ever originated. M. G. L. Pesce, a
French civil engineer, has conceived tbe
idea of reacbiug the Mecca of Arctic ex
plorers by means of a submarine boat,
which he would have travel 160 feet be
neath the surface 01 the sea. Most per
sons, however, would prefer to travel on
top of the water, and that is why Mr.
Baden-Powell's idea is considered worthy
of consideration and not chimerical.
It is not among the impossibilities that
at the proper season in 1897 this strange
craft may journey northward. Who will
man her, nnder whose guidance she will
go, is something for the future to dfcide.
It is quite likely that if she does go she
will float the American flag.
Battle With a Jfovjal Buck
William M. Stover, one of the lessees o
the Doyle mine at Horseshoe Bend, on
ilie Stanislaus River, was an unwilling
participant in a thrilling adventure last
week. The Sonora Democratic Banner
says that be shot at a larae buck which
was standing in bold relief on the crest of
a bill. The bullet went straight, and the
deer plunged forward and fell. Mr. Stover
laid his rifle down and hastened to his
fallen game for the purpose of cutting iti
throat. Just as be reached the deer and
leaned over to apply the knife the animal
leaved to bis feet and glared at Mr. Stover.
instantly the man seized the beast by
the horns. That action terrified the buck.
He made a plunge and down the steep
sides of Devils Canyon be Tent, carrying
the man with him. The deer was madly
frightened, and Mr. Stover was more
scared than the deer. He could not turn
loose, and away went man and animal
over rocks, bushes and briers. When
near the bottom of the canyon the deer
fell against a tree, ana before he could get
up, being nearly exhausted by his terrible
run, Mr. Stover grabbed a large piece of
quartz rock and killed the animal by beat
ing it on the head.
Mr. Stover had his clothes badly torn,
and his face and hands were scratched
by the bushes like unto the results of a
scrimmage with cats. He is unable to tell
how he escaped serious injury while going
down the side of the rough hill at a break
neck pd eed. The deer took him on the
jump every foot of the way. After the deer
was dead an examination showed that
the bullet bad struck him square upon
the horns near the head, which â  caused
him to fall over in a stunned condition.

A Romantic Stonj of the Days of

*â¢' â¢ From Golden Days.
In Lyonesse there reigned a King called
JLeliodas, who was a great hunter and
warrior. One day, while he was out with
h,is train, a snow-white hart dashed past
kirn, and pursuing it into the depths of
'the forest he became separated from his
followers. Then an enchantress, who had
sent the hart to lure the King into her
trap, imprisoned him in her castle, and
his followers sought but could not find
him.
\Vlien the Queen, who was a sister to
King Mark of Cornwall, heard of the
King's disappearance,- she searched in the
forests with only her attendant for com

panion. At last she fell sick from fatigue
and sorrow, and one beautiful morning
she closed her eyes upon the world,
breath. ng her last words into the ear of
her faithful gentlewoman, who held her
in her arms while her spirit fled.
"When the King returns tell him to
have my little son called Tristram," she
prayed, "for that means sorrowful birth."
And it was done as she asked.
King Meliodas loved Tristram for the
sake of the dead Elizabeth, but when the
child was 7 years old he married again.
The new mother learned to hate the boy,
for in him she saw the rival of her own
children to the inheritance of the crown.
So bitter did her thoughts become that at
last she laid a foul trap for the murder of
Tristram.
The young Princes played together in a
beautiful room in the palace and on a
table there the Queen placed a silver cup
containing a liquid poison. She hoped
that after playing Tristram would drink
from it in his thirst; but her cruel deed
cost her much suffering, for instead of
Tristram one of the other Princes took the
draught and the unhappy Queen saw her
own child die from the effect of her deed.
After this her hatred seemed even
greater toward the innocent cause of her
anguish, and again sbe put poison in the
cup with murderous intent But again
the boy was protected and tbe Queen was
foiled. King Meliodas, coming into the
room to see the Princes at their play, felt
very thirsty after the morning's hunt,
and, taking up the silver goblet brimful of
sparkling liquid, would have quaffed it.
But the Queen just then entered the room,
and with a cry dashed forward and
snatched the cup away, spilling the con
tents on tbe floor. Then in her fright
at what she had done she stood trembline
before tbe monarch, and good cause she
had to fear.
Drawing his sword the King stood above
her and commanded her to speak the
truth and tell what the cup contained, for
her action bad aroused his suspicions and
the Knowledge that his other son had been
poisoned seemed but to confirm, his fear.
The wretche l woman confessed her guilt,
but sbe pleaded for mercy on the ground
that her love for ber own children had
made her do the deed. But the King was
inexorable. He called his barons together
and ti.e council confirmed the King's de
cision that the Qusen should be burnt at
the stake.
When the news of the terrible punish
ment was noised abroad the people came
from far and near to witness the awful
spectacle. The stake was erected in the
courtyard, the fagots piled around its
base and as the mist lifted in the morning
the Queen was leu forth and bound.
Amidst awful stillness a burning brand
was tbrown on the pile and the flames
leaped up.
Ju^t at that moment, Tristram, who saw
the whole spectacle from a window in the
castle, rushed down, his face white and
drawn with agony. Failing at the feet of
the King, be cried:
"A boon, sire! I crave a boon !"
" 'Tis thine, my beloved son! Speak!"
"Oh, give me the life of thy Queen, my
mother!" he cried.
"Nay, thou shonldst not ask that. It is
for thee that I have condemned her. Ask
something else!"
But the boy only cried more loudly:
"'Tis all I wish! Spare her for my
sake!"
"My word is given," the King answered.
"Take her yourself from the fire. She
is yours to do with as you please."
All this took but a moment. The flames
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
had not yet reached the stake, when Trist
ram sprang across the burning pyre,
trampling the fire under his feet, and, cut
ting the cords that bound her, dragged the
half-fain tine Queen to safety.
Not content with tbe performance of this
noble deed, which won for him even more
love and esteem from the court and the
countryside than had before been lavished
upon him, Tristram found no peace or
rest till he had effected a reconciliation
Detween the King and the Queen. But
while he forgave her, Meliodas feared to
keep Tristram near the Queen, though she
showed by every sign that her hate had
turned to love, since the boy saved her life.
Tristram, therefore, was pat under the
charge of a learned man called Gouvernail,
who took him to France, where he learned
the language, the manners and customs of
the people, and bow to play on the harp
and on all other musical instruments.
For seven years he remained away, and in
his fifteenth year he returned to his
father's court.
When he reached the age of 19 years he
w*as the handsomest youth in the king
dom. Tall, straight as an arrow, with a
powerful form and a face in which
strength and gentleness met, he showed
in his outward semblance but the truth of
his character. He had proved himself
gentle hearted, loyal and kind, unselfish
and pure-minded, such a youth as one
would expect to find in the court of King
Arthur, though as yet Tristram had not
set foot there.
Though brave and valorous and strong,
the youth had not yet sought knighthood
by deeds of arms. But events were shap
ing themselves that would soon call him
into action.
It happened about this time that
King Anguish of Ireland and Tristram's
uncle, King Mark of Cornwall, had
a disagreement. Tbe ruler of lrelend sent
to King Mark, demanding the payment
of a tribute, which for seven years bad re
mained uncanceled. King Mark sent the
messenger back with the answer that he
owed no tribute nor would he pay it; but
that if King Anguish wished to prove his
claim he must send a champion who could
overcome King Mark's champi n At this
answer the monarch of Ireland was very
wroth, and he selected Sir Marhaus, a
knight of the Table Round, and brother to
his wife, for his champion.
Sir Marhaus hastened to Cornwall, ac
companied by a following, and his fleet of
six ships were soon anchored near tbe
castle of Tintagil. From there Marhaus
sent a challenge to King Mark, but he had
neglected to provide a champion.
Then word was sent out over Cornwall
that a champion for the Cornish right was
challenged by Marhaus. At first King
Mark's councilors advised sending to Ar
thur's court for Sir Launcelot dv Lake,
but as Marhaus also was a knight of the
Table Round, the inadvisability of doing
this was soon seen.
Day after day passed, each succeeding
one seeing a new challenge sent by Mar
haus to the King. And yet throughout
all Cornwall no knight appeared, for well
they all knew the strength and valor of
Marhaus and that no glory could come to
them in encounter with him.
At last the news spread to the court of
Meliodas, and Tristram hearing it felt all
the aneer in his youthful bosom roused
that in all Cornwall no knight was valiant
enough to face the champion of Ireland.
Seeking his father he poured forth his
indignation and besought- him to think of
some way by which the honor of Cornwall
might be saved.
"My son," Meliodas answered him. "I
know not what can be done. Marbaus is
a valiant knight King Arthur chooses
only the bravest to sit at his Table Round.
I fear that in all the land no knight can
cope with Sir Marhaus."
"Say you sol" the excited youth cried.
"Oh! It only I were a knight I would
show Sir Marhaus that the land is not full
of cravens! Shall we let him return to
Ireland to boast that in all Cornwall there
was no knight to break a spear with him!
Oh, my father, let me depart to my uncle's
court. Perhaps he may knight me and
let me hold arms as his champion!"

If you have a silver dollar of 1836, 1838,
or 1839, or one of the first nickel cents
coined in 1856, you will find upon it the
true portrait of an American eagle which
was for many years a familiar sight in the
streets of Philadelphia.
"Peter," one of the finest eagles ever
captured alive, was the pet of the Phila
delphia mint, and was generally known as
the "mint bird." Not only did he have
free access to every part of the mint,
going without hindrance into the treasure
vaults, where even the Treasurer of the
United States would not co alone, but
used his own pleasure in going about the
city, flying over the houses, sometimes
perching upon lamp-posts in the streets
Everybody knew him and admired him,
and even the street boys treated him with
respect. The Government provided his
daily fare, and be was as much a part of
the mint establishment as the superin
tendent or chief coiner.
He was so kindly treated that he had no
fear of anybody or anything, and he
might be in the mint yet if he had not
roosted on one of the great fly-wheels.
The wheel started without warning, and
Peter was caught in the machinery. One
of his wings was broken, and he died a
few days later. The superintendent had
his body beautifully mounted, witn the
wings spread to their fullest extent; and
to this clay Peter stands in a glass case in
the mint's cabinet, where you may see
him whenever you co there. An exact
portrait of him as he stands in the case
was put upon the coins named.â Harper's

Ten weary, footsore travelers,
All in a woeful plight,
Sought shelter at a wayside inn
One dark and stormy night.
"Nine bedsâ no more," the landlord said,
"Have I to offer you;
To each of eight a single room,
But the ninth must serve for two."
A din arose. The troubled host
Could only scratch his head;
For of those tired men no two
Could occupy one bed.
The puzzled host was soon at ease-
He was a clever man â
And so to please his guests deviled
This most ingenious plan:
JA|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|l!
In room marked A two men were placed;
The third he lodged in B;
The fourth to C was then assignedâ
The fifth retired to D;
In E the sixth be tucked away,
In F the seventh man;
The eighth and ninth in G and H
And theu to A he ran,
Wherein the host, as I have said,
Had laid two travelers by,
Then taking oneâ the tenth and last,
He lodged him safe in I.
Nine single roomsâ a room for eachâ
Were made to serve for ten,
And this it is that puzzles me
And many wiser men.

would write and let you know that I am still
in existence, although I have neglected the
Childhood's Realm during the last few weeks.
I saw a letter from Irene Phillips some time
ago. I know her and was glad to see a letter
from this town written by some one else besides
myself. Am I entitled to be a member of the
C. R. C? I have had a story, a poem and
about half a dozen letters printed in The
Call. I would like to be a member of the club
very much. That famous aerial ship was re
ported to have been floating over Calistoga
and Santa Rosa on Thanksgiving night. Wish
I had seen it. Your friend,
M. Eva Navone.
San Francisco, Cal., Nov. 25, 1896
Dear Editor: I thought I would write to The
Call. I like to go to school. We have spell
ing, arithmetic, geography and language.
We are going to have a vacation for two weeks
in December. At Christmas I am going to get
some playthings. We shall have a small
Christmas-tree, and a goose and turkey on
Thanksgiving day. Your friend,
Fred Figuera.
Oakland, CaL, Nov. 29.
Dear Editor: We have bad so much fun mak
ing gobolinks, I thought I should write and
tell you how much we enjoy your paper. We
had some gobolinks ready to send to you last
Sunday, but they got spoiled. We will try
some more soon. Papa took your paper last
summer, when we were at the Etna quicksil
ver mines, and mamma liked it best of all. If
you print this letter next Sunday I shall write
again and tell you how they get the quick
silver. Hoping this will please you, lam your
little friend, Gdy Pagnbllo, age 8 years.
Dear Editor: lam just 11 years old and go
to school. I love to write letters and I tried
to write some poetry. 1 send you a copy, and
if you think it worth puttingon the children's
page I should be very glad to see it. We have
three dogs and a Maltese cat, besides lots oi
chickens, four homing pigeons and eighteen
little birds, and the birds are all in one big
cage. One of the dogs is a big staghound, one
is a red Irish setter named Ginger and the
other is a fox-terrier His name Is Tony aud
he can do lots of funny tricks. This Is a long
lelter and 1 am afraid it will take up too much
room to print. Your friend,
Lulita Bates, 323 Geary street.

/Commodore DaVid Porter, Victor in Many Sea Figkts, J*an Foul of
Officials on Shore
Every American is familiar with the
early career of Commodore David Porter;
how as a lad he entered the first navy of
the infant republic; how in 1798, at the
age of 18, he became a midshipman; how
in Ihe following year he distinguished
himself during the struegle of the Con
stellation with l'lnsurgente by cutting
tfw,ay a wounded spar on his own respon
sibility*; how he shared the fate of tne
creW o;f the Philadelphia and was impris
6rred;at Tivoli, and how his cruise in the
E^sex was by far the most gallant and
.â¢.rGiH&ntic episode of the war of 1812.
Popular knowledge regarding Porter,
bowevsi, ceases with the return of peace.
says," Uie New York Sun. The popular
bel.ief .doubtless is that he then retired
into'some Valhalla of comfort, sustained
by the^gratuude of his countrymen and
cheered, Ly their universal plaudits. But
the sequel in reality was vastly different,
airo, in its record of futile self-sacrifice and
success and of patriotism confounded by
conservative officialism it presents a tale
of melancholy interest.
. :.Ln 1823 the Key West buccaneers were
dispersed by Commd'dore Porter, and
American merc'.antmen sailed unmo
:iee.ted. under his vigilant convoying. All
Xftis, however, was accomplished at the
cbstof-much sickness and many lives. In

-) ." N*ow, Mr. Southard, can you assert that
you know the bow from the stern of a
. friÃate?" .
Between him and Porter there was an
uigonism. The Secretary felt that be was
>~nored; the commodore fretted irom lack
of appreciation. The one felt his official
and the other his natural superiority.
There were squabbles about Porter's right
to return without permission. There were
muonstrancea over a suitable flagship
not being furnished. At length, in the
autumn of 1824, Porter sailed away lor his
station in the John Adams, as indignant
over slights as was Southard himself.
Meanwhile there had also been trouble
with 'the Mosquito fleet. On October 26
complaint was made to Charles S. Platt,
lieutenant commanding the Beagle, that
the stores of tee American Consular
Agent" at Bt. Thomas had been broken
into ,and goods to the amount of $5000
stolen. Many circumstances indicated
that this property had been carried to
Foxardo, a small town of unsavory repu
tation on the eastern end of Porto Rico.
More than once had pirates taken refuge
ifjero; more than once had its inhab
itants been guilty of acts of .'awlessness.
I'latt determined to proceed thither and
ke the aid of the authorities. He

which he bore addressed to one who was
universally deemed the first citizen of the
plpce..
PJatt anchored bis boat in the harbor

w"ilh three others, all being in private
dress. He found this iirst citizen, who
â¢ '\v:ts profuse in promises of assistance.
him he called on the Alcalde and
j captain of the port and demanded
COMMODORE DAVID PORTER
reparation 'and restitution. At first the
lieutenant's character was conceded and
his object of secrecy in appearing without
his uniform recognized. Later, however,
after the first citizen had talked apart with
'the officials, there was a' change. Platt
. was requested to show his register, and,
though be finally sent for his uniform and
commission, was denounc d roundly as a
pirate and placed under arrest in a filthy
s ronghold. At nightfall he was curtly
dismissed, and returned to his ship, with
out the stolen goods, and amid the jeers
ar.d curses of the populace.
On November 12 Porter arrived at St.
Thomas and received a report of this scur
vy treatment. He acted at once. Accom
panied by the Beagle and the Grampus he
sailei on the John Adams for Foxardo.
'1 here he sent a flag of iruce to the town
viih the message that if apology for the
4 â¢ atment of Lieutenant Piatt was not
J: ade within one hour he would storm the
:ice. He then landed companies of sail
ors and marines aggregating over 200 in
number. Ti.ese spiked two batteries
wlfere threatening preparations were be
ing mads ahd then proceeded inland. A
mob of native militia made some bliow of
force and for the moment an engagement
was imminent, when the Alcalde and the
captain of the port appeared and rendered j
submission. They apologized for Piatt's
imprisonment, they admitted that it was
wrongful and promised that thereafter
American officers should be respected and |
assisted. Then the troops marched back j
again, partaking of grog on the shore Jit '
the expense of their late antagonists.
Porter trade due report of these pro
ceedings to the Navy Department, prais
ing the conduct of his men and expatiat
ing on the good which this example would
produce. There is no doubt that he be
lieved he deserved well of his country;
there is no doubt that the order which he
received in reply from Southard recalling
him to explain "ihe extraordinary trans
actions' at Foxardo" came with crushing
force and shock. Not for one instant did
he regard such treatment otherwise than
as an outrage. He hastened to Washing
ton, hot with indignation, all ablaze from
the fever of wounded hhonorr r impatient of
each moment that delayed his vindica
tion.
There were many such moments, weary
and maddening. The department seemed
content to keep him on waiting order?.
The administration of Monroe was Just
passing out There Mere other matters
that could less conveniently await the
administration of John Quincy Adams.
But not for one moment did Porter ac
quiesce in such leisure. He wrote letters
by the score, entreating, berating. He
bombarded the press with voluminous
communications. If ever there was an
old sea dog_in a righteous rage, he was
that old sea dog.
In April President Adams ordered a
court of inquiry. This held its sessions at
Washington and throughout its course
was subject to Porter's acute and minute
criiicis-nis. Before its decision was ren
dered he had published an account of the
proceedings, showing his own iufallible
position. The court, however, took an
opposite view, and on its recommendation
Porter was summoned on the 231 of June
as a defendant before a court-martial of
twelve captains, with James Barron as
president.
Richard S. Coxe appeard as judge advo
cate. Porter's instant objection to him
resulted in a rather whimsical procedure.
One of the judges disclaimed his ability to
decide whether such a challenge should
be permitted without a legal opinion. The
judge advocate was thereupon called upon
to furnish such advice, which be naturally
did in favor of his own independent and
immovable position.
The charges were twofold. The first ac
cused Porter of disobedience and conduct
unbecoming an officer in that "he did
laud on the island of Poita Rico in the
dominions of his Catholic Majesty tne
King of Spain, and commit divers acts of
hostility in contravention of the constitu
j tion, the laws oi nations and the Govern-
I ment's instructions." The second charge
was the direct consequence of Porter's
sincere but injudicious rage, and dealt
i with his behavior since his return. It ac
' cused him of sending divers insulting let
ters to the President and Secretary of the
Navy, of having published an incorrect
account of the proceedings of the court of
inquiry with highly disrespectful com
ments, and of having made public various
official communications, thus "impairing
the discipline of the service and setting a
most dangerous and pernicious exampie." i
The proof adduced by the prosecution
on the first charge must have been highly
satisfactory to the old bero. Lieutenant
Platt testified as to his treatment at Fox
ardo, whereby it appeared mat in all like
lihood the worthy first citizen whose aid
be invoked was the receiver of the stolen
goods and had bribed the officials to in
sult and drive him from town. Platt and
the other officers present also testified as
to the details of Porter's famous expedi
tion. They all agreed that everything
had been done in an orderly manner and
under colors; that the spiking of the guns
had prevented bloodshed; that both the
Alcalde and the captain of the port had
excused their conduct by claiming to have
been urged on by the piratical nature of
the inhabitants; that for years past Fox
ardo had been a refuge for freebooters who
had ridiculed the prowess of Americans,
bat that now the flag and the uniform
met with respect.
Porter's defense was impassioned. Re
garding the second charge he said:
"If taken unawares by the buddenness
of the attack or the novelty of the situa
tion an excruciated sensibility may for the
time have broken loose through the guards
which should have preserved me unmoved
and self-balanced; yet, after all, I bow
with humility and experimental convic
tion to the moral system of compensa
tions."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
Doubtless he realized that he bad been
somewhat unmannerly in his demands.
Doubtless he felt, as every one well knew,
that he was as little fitted for a sea lawyer
as he was thoroughly fitted for a sea
fighter.
But the first charge was the main one
and alone worthy of consideration. Por
ter boldly justified his conduct. He
claimed that his instructions ordered him
"to protect the commerce and the citizens
of the United States from piracy," and
that discretion wps necessarily implied.
He showed that the Spanish islands were
without proper government and hence not
entitled to the benefit of the laws of
nations. He quoted from Join Quincy
Adams' spirited reply to the complaints
of Spain regarding General Jackson's in
vasion and occupation of the Floridas as
follows: "The right of the United States
can as little compound with impotence as
with perfidy." Indeed, he seemed
to find a sheet-anchor in Jackson's deeds
at Fort Bt. Marks and Pensacola. He ar
gued with Vattel that "there are occasions
when the subject may reasonably suppose
the sovereign's will and act in consequence
with his tacit commands."
But in vain. The court found Porter
guilty on botlfccharges and sentenced him
to suspension for six months. Regarding
the first charge it had the grace to say
that it ascribed the conduct of the accused
"Tougfy JWag," the Champion of Jack, Tap
/\ Rare Gharacter of the Barbary Goast, Popular Jhrougkovit the
White Nav\j.
"Tough Mag" is a rare character. She
is neither tall nor short for a woman,
neither blonde nor brunette; she dresses
neatly and wears usually a sailor's blouse;
she is rather pretty and as bright and as
keen as they make them on the Barbery
Coast; she knows every trick aboard a
man-of-war, anil every man of war's man
who sails into this port is her friend; she
has a ready tongue and snappy, forcible
words always on the end ot it; she has
some money and a decently furnished flat
up on Montgomery avenue near Union
street filled with curios and treasures from
over ihe seas i hat came from ali quarters
of the globe; beyond question she is the
only one of her kind on either the Barbery
or the Pacific Coast, and her name is â
well, they call her "Tough Mag."
She has a quick eye for business, ar.d
can figure interest with the speed of a
lightning calculator. The policemen on
the beat will tell you she is honest, and
there isn't a bluejacket in this port who
wouldn't trust her with his full kit and
buck pay included. Those who travel the
"coast" late at night have seen her in one
or the other of the coffee joints along
Montgomery avenue, for she doesn't keep
such hours as would be deemed entirely
respectable, say in the Western Addition.
Nevertheless she's a belle in her own "set."
and she has a reputation for "honesty, in
tegrity and veracity" â as the lawyers
say â that would be worth lots of money
to a business man or banker who should
be lacking in that respect.
Maggie JKelly she calls herself, but no
one else calls her that, and she answers to
the other name just as readily. She's the
patron saint of the sailor boys who go
down to the sea in Uncle Sam's white
ships, and she knows every man-jack one
of them. She's their banker.
Is Jack Tar broke while in port? Then
he pays a visit to "Tough Mag." He finds
her at home, or somewhere else on Mont
gomery avenue, and when hs conies into
her presence he ta lres off his hat, just as
folks do in the We3t&rn Addition, and
though he talks to her in his own jargon
and technique of the breezy ocean he treats
her respectfully â as Jack Tar always
knows how to treat a woman. She knows
what he wants â perhaps better than he
knows himselfâ and he always gets it,
somewhat after this fashion:
"Why don't you fellows save your
mouey? Then you wouldn't always be
broke. You're a disgrace to., yourself and
the ship you sail in. Been on v tear,
haven't you? You're good for nothing,
anyway, but to spend money. Don't tell
me you sent money home. That won't
wash. Oh, I'm onto your tricks. Why,
you ain't even written to your old mother
for six months. 'Why don't you brace up
and be a man ? It'Â« ten dollars you want,
is it? It's just ten cents you'll get out of
me. I've got no money to throw away on
such as you! W 7 hen'.s.your liberty up?
This afternoon, eh! And you're going
over to Mare Island looking like that?
Say, here's a fiver; put your namo dowu
there. Now, go and get a shave and a
cup of coffee, and get down to the Mc-
Dowell as fast as you can."
"to an anxious disposition on his part to
maintain the hono- and advance the in
terests of the nation and the service";
but there was no saive for Porter in these
words. He felt unjustly disgraced. He
resigned his commission and accepted the
offer of commander-in-chief of the naval
forces of Mexico.
Though this position was splendid in
power and emoluments it proved but bit
ter exile to Porter. He waa^an alien, sur
rounded by those who hate^ his race, de
spised hi 3 raligion and envied his honors.
This extract from ore of his private let
ters describes his experience there:
"A retrospect of the history of my life
seems a highly colored romance which I
should be loth to live over again, and it
would not be believed if it was written.
My sufferings in Mexico, the trials of for
titude I underwent there, exceed belief. 1
could have served that base and unprinci
pled nation, but they would not let me.
But I left them without a stain on my
character, w.'iich was not what others un
der the same circumstances would have
done."
With the election of Jackson there came
welcome relief. Ohl Hickory had a fellow
feeling for one who "could as little com
pound with impotence as with perfidy" in
the Dons. And so Porter ceased to be a
mercenary and once more served his coun
try, becoming her representative, first at
Algiers, and then at Constantinople. He
proved, as ever, faithful and competent,
but his end was an anti-ciimax from the
glorious days of the Essex. He surely
deseivid a better fate tban defeat after sn
unworthy struggle with red tape and wax.
Much might well have been forgiven him,
for hi both loved and served much. He
was a type of the old navy, bluff, simple,
brave; above all and through all patriotic
âa type to be worthily remembered.
THE PETRIFIED WOMAN ON EXHIBITION.
If Jack is a new man at this port, and
no one has posted him about "Tough
Mag," he is likely to put his foot into it
by trying to interrupt her scolding or of
fering any excuses for himself. In that
case he will only call down upon his de
voted head a more prolonged and more
picturesquely worded tongue-lashing than
he has heard for many a day. Perhaps it
does him some good and perhaps it
doesn't. At all events it probably does
him no harm, and Maggie ieels in duty
bound to administer it whether or no.
For she is a motherly sort of a girl, who
takes no little pride in her self-imposed
task of reforming Jack Tar. Some people
wouldn't approve of her methods alto
gether, but it is safe to say that her good,
honest, homely scoldings are more effect
ive and far-reaching than an equal amount
of finely phrased sermons would be.
She wears quire a wonderful navy blouse
on all state occasions, it wan made on
the high seas by JacK Tar and his brother,
and was presented to Maggie with due'
ceremonial solemnity several years ago
when she lived at Vallejo. Though the
blouse is hand-made, and masculine-made
at that, it bears evidence of an immense
amount of v#ry careful and somewhat r.r
tistic needlework. It is covered with flags
and cannons and other navy emblems,
and thongli it is worth lots of dollars, in
trinsically, it would never sell lor half the
value she puts upon it. When Maggie
wants to be real swell she wears this navy
blous*, and no fine lady in the Western
Addition is prouder of her fine silks or
laces than is Maggie of her sailor-made
jacket. â¢ .
She had a husband onee â Billy Lias â
and he is living, so far as is known at this
writine, and there has been no divorce.
But Billy always gets in trouble with
knives and pistols and such things. He
seems to have a penchant for that kind of
conduct, and just at present he Is in retire
ment, or was not long ago. At all events
he is not in evidence now, and his person
ality is commonplace and uninteresting,
wnile exactly the reverse is true of Mag
gie. Hers is one of the most interesting
and picturesque characters to be found in
these modern prosaic days. There is so
much of contrariety In it, to begin with â
so much of conventional wickedness, so
yttle of moral sinfulness.
Judged by the surroundings alone one is
nmazed to find in this loud-spoken, deter
mined little woman of the Barbary Coast
a strong individuality of kindly instincts
and generous impulses. She is always
jolly, yet always sensible, always frugal
and" painstaking, economical and indus
trious; she can paddie her own canoe
under all circumstances, and she asks
neither friend nor foe for favor. She makes
her own living and makes it "squarely,"
as the sailors say, and she saves her money
without being stin.y with it. At times
she has been a waitress here or there in a
restaurant or in a beer saloon, but always
she has loaned money to the able seamen
of the white navy, and when they have
paid her back they have always paid her
more than she loaned them. And this is
the most contrary circumstance about her
.Now Chicago .Has a Petrified Woman
/\ JMarVelous Discovery Jhat Is at Present Engrossing the Attention
At last the secret of seeming perpetual
existence, at least in material form, for
human beings has been discovered. A
Chicago man is the originator of the cause |
of this phenomenon which has deeply in- j
terested medical scientists. He has in his |
possession at the present moment a I
woman whose eyes closed to earthly things ;
last July; who, to all appearances, has just j
awakened from slumber.
This new idea must not be confounded
with that of the ancients, specimens of
whose skill have been unearthed by
archaeologists. Had the knowledge of
this modern inventor been possessed at
the time of the Pharaohs it would not j
have been necessary for us to learn of the j
appearance of the famous persons of cen
turies ago from description. We should
have been able to see for ourselves just
how they looked. It would have been
possible to have marveled through actual
sight at the beauty of the woman for whom
Marc Antony surrendered life and honor.
Though we could not have heard the song
of Miriam we could have looked upon the
face of the sinyer. The discovery goes to
prove that the boasted superiority of the
knowledge of those who lived at the be
ginning of the Christian era is at least
tradition only in one respect.
How the marvel is accomplished is the
secret of Inventor Boydston, who lives at
âthat she should be a usurer. How
ever, no one ever called her Shylock, and
the rate of interest she demands is much
less than the average money-lender out
side oi commercial life usually extorts.
The appellation of "Tough Mag" grew
upon Maggie Kelly not so much because
she was really tougher than the other
girls of her class as because of her inde
pendence and her ability to take care of
herself under all sorts of circumstances.
To attempt any undue familiarity
with Maggie Kelly is to receive a stinging
slap in the face, or, perhaps, if the case is
not aggravated, then a scolding that is
calculated to put the offender to flight if
not to shame. It is true, also, that Mag
gie's choice of words upon all occasions is
original. She selects them more for the
purposes of emphasis than euphony, and
her language at all times is more forcible
than poetic. Sometimes she uses words
that newspapers employ dashes to repre
sent. It is said that in her dealings with
the numerous family of Jack Tar she has
never lost a cent. Many an able seaman
sails out of this port indebted to her from
half a month to three months' pay. Per
haps he will return in a few months, per
haps in a co.iple of years, but when he
does come back he squares accounts with
Maggie the first thing. And he gives her
a present besides. He brings her some
thing from over the seasâ a rare fur, a
parrot or a shell. Her home on Mont
gomery avenue is quite a museum in its
way.
She might sell many of these presents
and realize handsomely on some of them,
but she never does. She prizes them all
and cares for them with a good deal of
pride In their possession, and her fond
ness for money does not reach beyond the
stage of endowment with a knack for
making it and keeping it. In truth, she
hasn't any great amount of it to boast of,
but what she has she has made by the
sweat of her own keen wit.
You may see her after night with two
or three reeling bluejackets in tow. She
has met them on the street, perhaps. She
knows they are in no condition to go
prowline around, and she has issued per

It wa3 high treason for a bluejacket to
disobey Maggie Kelly's command, and
they never do. She takes them home,
gives them a cup of strong coffee; gives
them each and all a good scolding and
then sends them back to their ships. Or
you may see her meet a reeling sailor
early in the evening on the "coast."
Then she demands his money and his
watch. If he has either or both he hands
them over without grumbling, and when
he has sobered up the next day or the day
after he will find his valuables safe with
Maggie Kelly, and himself that much
richer for her good offices. She's a rare
character, is "Tough Mag," and the annals
of Barbary Coast will, in future years, re
member her as the patron saint of the able

still more prosaic latter day will sigh vain

For years he has experimented along the
line which has ended in success. He be
lieved himself for a very long period on
the verge of a great discovery and finally
he achieved what he bad almost begun to
fear was an impossibility.
The subjact of this experiment ended
her life last July. Nature had made her |
beautiful, and. Ln all the weeks that have
elapsed since existence terminated not
one whit has that beauty deteriorated.
The young woman was just nearing her
twenty-third year and was a Chicagoan
by birth. She was rather above the aver
age station in life, but had been thrown
on her own resources. She died rather
suddenly and thei efore no wasting disease
marred her beauty. As all her relatives were
dead, and as her friends were unable to
pay her funeral expenses, Mr. Boydston
determined, instead of letting her go to
an unmarked <:rave, to make her the sub
ject of an experiment. The thought of
keeping a young woman wbo had passed
away iv a big city was a daring one and
seemed more like the tale of a fiction
writer.
Mr. Boydston resolved to brave criticism
and proceed to put his theory to the test.
In a selected space in the rear of his shop
he placed the young woman and then be
gan the process that has resulted in a
marvel. At the present moment this
phenomenon lies in a box within a few feet
of one of Chicago's bnsy streets. Thous
ands pass daily, unconscious of her pres
ence. When Mr. Boydston wishes to ex
hibit the success of bis idea the young
woman is taicen from the place where she
lies and placed in such a position that she
is supported by the wall. Behind her is
draped a curtain. She seems to have just
awakened from slumber and to be about
to speak. Her eye.s are bright and look
out at those around her as if instinct with
life, and yet she is as inanimate as a mar
ble statue.
Every possible test has been made to
prove the experiment either a success or a
failure, and in every instance the result
has pointed toward the fact that now
stands revealed. Mr. Boydston here for
the first time makes public the knowledge
of what has happened. It is nor a matter
of which he cared to say such, but finally
he realized that such knowledge as this
was not only of interest to people in gen
eral, but would engross the attention of
medical science. It marKs a new era in
the line of avoiding, in anpearance at
least, the presence of the great destroyer.
It accomplishes what many persons have
sought for years to do. It shows that we
are on the borderland of a continent of
knowledge of which even the closest
students of the human physique are to
tally ignorant.
Mr. Boydston's discovery seemingly
makes a person who has passed away
totally impervious to the destructive pro
cesses of nature. A startling fact is, too,
that it is in toial contradiction to one of
the best-known biblical precepts. Never
In the history of the world has anything
been discovered of this sort which com
pares with this, or, at least, what it seems
to be. Of course, time alone can success
fully answer the question, but so far as
experiments can show the statement
made is absolutely correct.
While Mr. Boydston has had but little to
say concerning the strange truth his pa
tient investigation has revealed to him the
fact of his achievement has become noised
abroad to a slight extent among medico-
MAGGIE KELLY, THE SAILOR'S FRIEND.
scientists and others interested in the
subject. In consequence of this he has
permitted a numDer of persons to Res for
themselves just what has been accom
plished. The accompanying illustration,
which is drawn from a photograph taken
expressly by iui-tructions of Mr. Boyd
ston to make clear to the eye what this
article fails to make understood, shows
the subject of experiment exactly as she
appeared the other day when viewed by a
party of visitors. It will be observed that
she is apparently standing looking out at
those about her, much after the fashion of
a model in the studio of aan artist. In
fact, to those to whom studio life is
familiar there will seem little about the
picture that is unusual. The posture, the
drapery and all are not uncommon in the
least. It is a fact that a person who by
chance entered the room where she stood
would for the moment think himself
looking upon a beautiful statue or else
that he had stumbled upon a woman pos
ing for some character that existed in the
days when all roads truly led to Rome
and Rome was the world.
To none has this strange discovery and
its equally marvelous result been of
deeper interest than to the members of
the medical profession. The skill of the
best of them has never been ablo to ac
complish or even to suggest what this
plain every-day student of Chicago has
learned through sheer perseverance. It
all goÂ°s to show that while science is a
tremendous factor in the world's progress,
sterling common sense and unwavering
resolution will accomplish much. So it is
that physicians and surgeons are forced
to admit that for once the layman has
proved himself superior to the professional
in a purely professional matter. So rare
it is that such a thing happens that it is
almost worth a separate entry in the book
of fate.
Mr. Boydston has not yet decided what
'he will do with the secret that is his. Of
course, the charlatan has attempted to
victimize him and there is no lack of offers
from "disinterested" persons to exploit
both himself and the knowledge that he
has gained. None have met with success.
At present he will do nothing beyond
what has been accomplished. He con
siders there is plenty of time in the future
to arrive at a decision.
Present indications are that the ulti
mate result of this new process will be
petrifaction. The opinion of all medical
scientists who have viewed the subject of
experiment is that this is what is grad
ually coming to pass. It may bo this dis
covery will result in the majority of future
generations being transformed into stone
and that their appearance when life ended
will remain without change perhaps until
tne last trump is sounded.
In the early days of civilization in
America Ponce de Leon sought in vain for
the waters of the fountain of youth. Five
centuries later the secret of making us
seem to have perpetual life stands re
vealed.
The Qreat Khan of Tartarvj.
The personal appearance of the Great
Khan, as described by Marco, was as fol
lows: "He ia of good statue, neither tall
nor short, but of middle height. He has
a becoming amount of flesh and is very
shapely in all his limbs. His complexion
is white and red, the eyes black and fine,
the nose well formed and well set on."
But the portrait of Kublai Khan, drawn
by a Chinese artist, does not exactly cor
respond with the pen portrait given here
by Marco. We know also, from Marco's
own narrative, that the Emperor was sub
ject to gout in his later life, and we are led
to infer that he was rather corpulent, as
he is represented in the drawing given by
the Chinese artist. â Noah Brooks in the

General Horace Porter, in his "Cam-
paigmng With Grant" in the December
Century, relates an anecdote telling how
General Grant aided a drover in turning
his cattle. General Porter adds: He
knew, of course, that the man did not
recognize him. If he had supposed the
man was lacking in proper military re
spect he would perhaps have administered
to him the same lesson which he onot
taught a soldier in the Twenty-first Illi
nois, when he commanded that regiment.
An officer who had served under him at
the time told me that Colonel Grant, as
he came out of his tent one morning,
found a strapping big fellow posted as
sentinel, who nodded his head good

"Howdy, colonel?" His commander
cried, "Hand me your piece," and upon

"The play's the thing," not only, as
Hamlet remarks, "to catch the conscience
of the King, " but also to catch the
elusive dollar of the fickle theater-goer.
Wilton Lackaye has just given us a sink
ing proof of this. For a long time he
reaped a golden harvest as Svengall in
"Trilby." His success enamored him of
hypnotism, and last week he appeared at
the Baldwin as a star in "Dr. Belgraff,"
a play by Charles Klein, based on hyp
notism. The company was better than
Palmer's "Trilby" Company, and Lackaye
gave a magnificent character study of the
hypnotist, but the play !â aye, there's the
rubâ the play made the fickle theater-goer
take some of bis dollars elsewhere.
The shortcoming in "Dr. Belgraff"
is its unpardonable lack of ro
mance. People may be fickle, common
place and sordid in real life, but it is com
mercially unwise, as well as dramatically
immoral, to represent them all as being
so on the stage.
Charles Klein's play is as sordid as a
chapter out of tbe Police Gazette, and as
destitute of any snarK of romance. Dr.
Belgraff, a country apothecary, is so
wrapped up in chemical experiments as to
be blind to the fact that his frivolous sis
ter has fallen a victim to one of the most
blackguardly baronets that ever trod tbe
stage, and baronets in the drama are gen- j
erally steeped in vice. The apothecary's I
v Because murder ain't my game n â Scene in ** Cotton Kino; " at
the Columbia*
shop seems to be the rendezvous for the
aristocracy of the neighborhood, who walk
in and out promiscuously without buyine
anything, which perhaps accounts for Bel
graff's straitened circumstances. Sir
Geoffrey Langham has long scenes with
Miss Belgraff in the shop without being
disturbed by customers or arousing the
suspicions of the household. This phil
andering .is put a stop to by a young
squire, who is in love with Agnes Lang
ham, Sir Geoffrey's sister. The enter
prising youth divulges the true state ot
affairs to Belgraff, and almost simul
taneously with his vow of vengeance the
apothecary discovers that he can sway
Miss Langham as he wills through his
power to hj pnotize her.
After these discoveries matters go on
briskly. Dr. Belgraff murders Sir Geoffrey
and Agnes is a witness to tbe crime. No
one else seems to suspect ihe doctor, and
dressed up in his best clothes he takes
up his abode at Langham Hall as tne ac-
Knowledged fiance of Agnes, who gives all
the outward and visible signs of insanity.
The idiotic family practitioner jovially ac
quiesces in the matrimonial arrangements,
in spite of the fact that Dr. Belgraff is
consuming enoueb whisky (presumably
an asset of the murdered baronet) to jus
tify any friend of Miss Langham's in for
bidding the banns. But the .sacrifice is
about to be consummated when the vil
lage policeman, the only entirely sane
character in the play, takes a hand in the
coime of events. This astute limb of the
law make it his business to bring a cele- j
brated aiienist from London, and the vis
itor finds out at a glance that Agnes is
not mad, but hypnotized. She is at once

the game is up Belgraff takes poison, and
the last scene of all, which ends this
strange, eventful history, shows Agnes
falling into the arms of her lover, who,
although accused of Sir Geoffrey's mur
der, is roaming aoout at large.
The audience is sent home with the
distressing knowledge that Miss Langham

where she undoubtedly belongs. The
(ears for her future are not allayed by"
the recollection of portentous remarks

ity ana the sins of the father being visited
on the children. Miss Lan^harc's father
had erred and strayed from the narrow
path, and his shortcomings had oeen
visited on his daughter in the shape of
mental weakness.

ness, and to people who like the morbid
satisfaction of getting cold chills "Dr. Bel
graff" must have been a great treat. I
think, though, that most of us are of a
eayer disposition than Mr. Klein and Mr.
Lackaye give us credit for. Villainy and
brutality do not repel us on the sta*e
when they are used as foils to virtue and
heroism, but why should we pay our hard
earned dollars to sit under a pall of gloom,
unrelieved by a ray of heroism, unrelieved
by a hero to applaud or even a heroine to
weep for?
In his eagerness to give Lackaye a great
role Cnarles Klein has tried to make him
the hero and the villain rolled into one,
and the result is something that is neither
fish nor flesh nor good red herring. Bel
graff's one weak effort at heroism is when
in the dawning consciousness of his love
for Agnes be advises her to elope with her
lover. But no sooner does he find that
her departure will jeopardize his own
safety than he thinks better of bis mo
mentary unselfishness and acts with as
sharp an eve to the well-being of No. las
the most vulgar criminal could do. In
real life we might feel a contemptuous
pity for tbe poor wretch, but on the stage
we have no u*e for a hero whose heart is not
in the ri ht place. As a villain K-lcraff
is lacking in daring and resource. What
self-respecting villain would let himself be
foiled by a fat, self-complacent village
policeman?
As for Agnes, tbe girl whom Belgraff
controls hypnotically, she is given no op
portunity of showing that she possesses
either a mind or a heart, and her utter
mental flabbiness aronses only shocked
surprise and a creepy feeling of disgust.
Miss Marie Wainwright has a thankless
task in her puppet-like rolfc. Its one oppor
tunity lay in the expression of horror,
nd of that she took such good advantage
with her cold, stony glare and white, petri
fied face that she actually aroused a re
sponsive shudder.
The most sympathetic of characters, |
and that is not saying much for him, is
Agnes' lover, a manly, commonplace
young fellow, who does nothing to
arouse especial interest, except on the
strength of the proverb which says that
all the world lovas a lover. The rest of
the dramatis persons are cast in such an
unheroic mold that no one cares much
what becomes of them. Even the comic
errand- Hoy is selfish and his affections
have not the sticking-plaster consistency
for the comic maid which arouses the
admiration of the gallery for the normal
stage errand-boy.
In short, despite their excellent char
acter drawing, Wilton Lackaye and Lis
gifted company are placed, for lack of
sympathetic material, in the position of
tbe Israelites when called upon to make
bricks without straw.
The mistake lay in believing that a
weird story and the artistic rendering of
sordid characters were sufficient of them
selves to arouse public enthusiasm. Rouzh
hew them as you will, though, the ends of
the dramatist are to appeal to the heart or
the risibilities of his audience. If he
pipe tbe audience will dance (metaphor
ically speaxing), and if he mourn it will
lament, but let him brin i out tbe scalpel
and the stethoscope for cold analysis and
the audience Ah! where is it? Gone
to hear rival dramatists, of course. Ibsen
and other morbid gentlemen have tried
spreading out grewsome dramatic feasts,
but the paying public has never been
tempted to their board. Charles Klein
has now shown us that without something
romantic to rire the heart and the imagi
nation even a fascinating study in hyp
notism cannot make a successful play.
Just across the way from the Baldwin
Joseph Grismer gave his ideas of a hero,
at the Columbia, in a part he bad /written
to order for himself, aided and abetted by
Clay M. Greene, and a rich, ripe, luscious
feast of noble deeds be made of it.
Captain Ford could have fed Dr. Belgraff
with the crumbs of good deeds that fell
from his table â aye! a dozen such, so
bountifully was bis measure pressed down
and running over with all the virtues in
the calendar. Captain Ford was honest,
manly and noble; he unselfishly thought
of tbe heroine before he dreamed of think
ing of himself; when foully provoked he
bore taunts rather than forget tbat he was
a gentleman, and he had the courage to
slay and face the tortures of a prison when
urged to seek safety in flight. Cold words
cannot convey any true idea of Captain
Ford's noble deeds, for Joseph Grismer
has played many parts in his time â heroic
partsâ and be has made Captain Ford a
conglomeration of tbe heroic qualities to
be found in all of them.
It was the old and the newâ Grismer
showing the antique hero of melodrama,
all virtue and eldry, and Lackaye giving
us a modern character study, as unsoftened
by romance as the dissecting-room is.

When Thomas W. Keene made his last
trip to England he visited Bosworth field
and determined to bring back \o his
friends a peculiar souvenirâ a Richard 111
variety of potatoes. So he bought a bushel
of the "murphies" tbat had grown on that
historical battle -ground and had them
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, STXSÂ«rwAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
sent to him. He had a lot of trouble to
get them safely over to this country, but
they arrived just before he started out for
his annual tour, and he took them to his
Castleton Corners home, and had them
safely bestowed in a dry corner of the
cellar, to be kept for planting in the
spring. One day the servant ran across
these potatoes and found that they had
begun to sprout.
"It's too bad to let these potatoes be
spoiling here in the cellar all winter," she
said, and she carefully brushed away the
swelling "eyes" and took them up to the
pantry. Mrs. Keene had been on a visit
to her husband when this happened and
she returned home about the time tbe
last of the Bosworth field beauties bad
gone into the pot. "Where did you get
these potatoes?" she asked the girl;
they are nice large ones." "In the cellar,
ma'am." "In the cellar? I didn't know
that we had any potatoes in the cellar."
Then she remembered that Tom bad
asked her to look particularly at his
"Richard III" tubers and see that they
were keeping well, and she huriied down
to investigate. The sack was empty.
"Annie," she said, solemnly, to the girl,
"you have fed the family well. Those
potatoes cost Mr. Keene $2 50 each. Did
they taste any better than those you
bought at the grocer's for 10 cents a peck?"
Thatcher, the minstrel at the Orpheum,
was telling a story on Alf Hampton
of the Lackaye company, the other day,
which he says is true, because he was
present when it happened. Hampton so
strongly resembles Nat Goodwin that he
is often called "Goodwin's double," and
on the strength of this likeness he has
given public imitations of Goodwin in his
various parts.
Some time ago both great men happened
to be playing in the same town and Good
win managed to get off from a matinee
performance to see Hampton impersonate
him in "A Gilded Fool." Hampton's turn
came on and Goodwin from a stage box
watched it with such deep interest that
Hampton ;felt convinced he had made a
deep impression. Both actors met outside
the theater when the show was over,
and Hampton asked eagerly, "Well,
Goodwin, what do you think of it?"
"Well," replied Goodwin, in his lei
surely way, "if that is an impersonation
of my acting, all I can say is, that one of
us is no good."
BaldWirv Theater.
From all accounts Wilton Lackaye will
offer a fine bill at the Baldwin Theater to
morrow night when ne will produce for
the first time on any stage the comedy
"Captain Bob" and the one-act drama
"Moliere" for the first time in America.
The latter play was presented in England
by George Alexander, and is said to have
achieved a prominent success. It is from
the pen of Walter Frith, son of the Frith
who is the celebrated Royal Academy
painter. "Moiiere" is lounded on the last
hours of the comedy genius and illustrates
the manner in which t c famous man be
came reconciled to his wife, from whom
he bad been estranged, just before be died.
"Captain Bob" 'is in three acts and is the
worK of Robert Drouet, an actor and piay
1 wri^ht. Lackaye will appear in the title
role.
The next attraction at the Baldwin
Theater will be the spectacular production
of "Palmer Cox's Brownies."

"The Cotton King," one of Brady's melo
dramas. The most realistic scene in the
play is said to be that which shows tbe
Asbton Mills, with the calico spinning
machinery in full operation.
The story is said to be full of interest
and sentiment.
Joseph R. Grismer on this occasion will
essay a character role, that of James Shil
lingiaw, an engine-driver. It will be
quite a departure from tbe parts he has
played recently. John T. Sullivan has
been specially engaged to play the part of
Jack Osborne, Edward Heron for Benja

who has been Drought from Npw York
City, will play the part of Kitty Mansfield.

SALVINI WILL fLy\y IT.
A Romantic Drama by Johr\ Bor\
r\er and Daughter, jVliss
Qeraldine Bonner.
It hai jnst leaked out that two well-
Known San Francisco writers, John Bon
ner and his daughter. Miss Geraldine
Bonner, have written a romantic drama,
which will shortly be produced on the Pa
cific Coast.
Tbe work was completed several months
ago and was first submitted to Alexander
Salvini, who was so delighted with it that
he at once decided to make the Bonner
drama one of the star features of his au
tumn and winter tour. Shortly afterward
the young traaedian fell ill at the villa of
his illustrious father in Italy. Reports of
his condition crew more and more dis
couraging, and finally tne Salvini tour
was abandoned and the Italian papers
stated authoritatively tbat the young tra
gedian was dying of tuberculosis of the in
testines.
In this unhappy state of affairs it seemed
impossible that the drama written by Mr.
and Miss Bonner could ever be produced
by Salvini and they were just opening
negotiations with James O'Neill, when
yesterday they received news that Salvini
was well acain and would shortly betnn
his long-defÂ«Â»rred American tour. Not
oniy is Alessandro himself again, but he
is said to be Istronger and better for his
long rest and he is anxious to give the
drama written by the Bonners its first
hearing in San Francisco. In all proba
bility that will be some time this season,
as tbe canceled dates in the Salvini tour
are rapidly being filled again.
The name of the drama and its story are
still kept close secrets, but the subject is
known to be a very romantic one.
John Bonner is one of the best known
newspaper writers on the Pacific Coast
and Miss Geraldine Bonner has made
quite a name for herself as a contributor
to Harper's, Vogue and other well-known
periodicals. She also has the reputation
of being one of tbe most talented and re
liable on dramatic subjects in America.
Mrs. Ker\dal's /\r\ger.
Mrs. Kendal has been letting her angry
pas&ions rise again, not against the great
American "public this time, but against
the London critics, headed by Clement
Scott, and particularly against a writer in
th>- Lon :on Referee.
The matron of the British drama said
that she went home and wept when she
read the things that Clement Scott and
his fellow-critics said about her acting.
In this lachrymose state of mind she found
one day on her kitchen tab c a copy of the
Referee, in which a well-known writer,
who bears the pen name of Carados,
pointed out the fact that Tom Robertson's
crave in Brompton Cemetery was going to
wreck and ruin from neglect.
Tom Robertson, in addition to being a
famous playwright, had the honor in his
day of being Mrs. Kendal's brother. When
the lady espied the reference to his grave
on her kitchen table she at once wrote a
choice epistle to Carados, of which the
following is the conclusion:
I offered years ago to attend to my dear
brother's grave, but the paper proving the
ownership of same cannot be found and
among so many has been loft; and (as even
you in your ignorance may know) that unless
one can prove the ownership of the grave to
clean or alter anything connected with it is
Impossible.
When you write my brother's name again
do it on your knees with your hat off ! 1 never
knew your paper existed till I saw it one day
on my kitchen table, when I told my House
keeper to burn it. She rung for the groom,
who sent for the stable boy, who did so. Yours
faithfully, Madge Kkndal.
While Mrs. Kendal was penning this
ladylike effusion Clement Scott, who iiad
also read the Referee, was wending his
way to the grave of Tom Robertson. He
easily obtained the permission of the
cemetery authorities to restore his old
friend's monument at bis own expense
and put flowers and plants there, wnich
made it a little garden of sleep. It is an
onen secret tbat for some years past Mrs.
Kejidal has had a grievance against Cle
ment Scott. Not long ago she wrote of
him: "The poor man has lost his judg
ment and makes me weep." Well! Cle
meru Scott has heaped coals of tire on her
head", but it is very probable that they
will only add fuel to the fire of Mrs. Ken
dal's wrath.

There is a play in New York which has been
written around a 'cello. It is to be hoped that
this won't start our dramatists writing plays
around fiddles, bass drums and trombones.
We have had plays written around fire en
gines, train wrecks, bank burglars and bridge
jumpers, but they are fast serving their useful
ness. Let our future plays be written around a
j story.

S Explanation.
The arrow files with the wind. The top figure* I
, at station indicate maximum temperature for thÂ« ;
days; those underneath It. if any, the amount of â 
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and bundredtbs, â 
during tbe past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid j
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso- .
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hleh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied .by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
'and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us 1 ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In thÂ« interior
and' low along the coast, and the Isobars extend,
north and south along the coaÂ«. rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregdn is improb
able. With a "high" in ihe vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
will produce an opposite result.

fallen from 8 deg. to 10 de;. In Northwestern Ne

CHICAGO MAKKETB.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. s.â As the advance of
Thursday in this market was disregarded by Liv
erpool, so also was the decline of yesterday. The
fact that cables from that place quoted a firmer
unchanged market proved to be a saving factor,
prices at the opening being qnotably from %c to
iy 8 c over yesterday's , close. Argentine crop re
por.s were bad, rain in that country, causing dam
age. The shipments from there for the week were
128 000 bushels. American shipments for th<Â»
Shine period from both coasts were 3,653,000
bushels. '. M , â  ,â_,

Ciiicaxo received 47 cars and inspected out 81.
324 bushels Laree clearances at Atlantic ports
for the day, 631.949 bushels,, and charters at that
Dlace for 600.000 bushels gave prices a further
upward impetus. Closing Continental cables were

the buying- Receipts were 326 cars ana 34.697
bushels were taken from store. Exports <t corn

. OAT â The trade In oats was of tbe same dull
and unattractive character as was â¢ usual. .-Yester
day's decline although moderate created a "short"

the tone. Sympathy with the other grains was
the consideration. Receipts .were 26s cars, and

A FORTUNE HANGS
OF A LITTLE WORD
Charles Manner May Get
One Hundred Thousand
"Then, Again, It May Amount
to Only Ten Thousand
in Value.
When the Late J. S. Hendy Wrote
"Oae-Fifteth" in His Will,
What Did He Mean ?
It is not every man who is able to say
that the interpretation of the meaning of
a single letter makes a difference of $90,000
to him, yet that is the position of Charles
Manner, for many years .connected with
the Hendy Machine Works of this City.
If Judge Coffey's decision goes his way his
purse will be ten times as bip as the
$10,000 prize for which Sharkey and Fitz
simmons lought in the ring and for which
they are now squabbling in the courts;
but if it goes against him he will still get
as much as was offered by the National
Athletic Club, with nothing to be de
ducted for costs of training and subse
quent litigation.
The orthography of the late J. S. Hendy
was not altogether above criticism, and
his originality in this branch of learning
has led to prolonged discussions by many
attorneys in Judge Coffey's department
lof the Superior Court.
Some time before Mr. Hendy's death he
decided to make a will, and to dodge a
. lawyer's fee by writing the document
himself.
Mr. Manner's interest in construing the
will depends on a brief clause which reads
. as follows:
I give to Charles Manner one-fiftetb. of my
s tock in the Hendy Machine Company.
The reason for asking the court to con
strue the meaning of this disputed word
was that an effort has been made to settle
certain contentions among the relatives.
A certain amount of money was necessary
to consummate tho arrangements, and in
open court bamuel M. Shortridge an
nounced tnat he represented the capi
talist who stood ready to advance the
coin.
- â¢ Upon that Attorney E. B. Young took
up the argument against Mr. Manner's
view of the case. He said that the testi
' pony showed that Mr. Manner was not
' related to the testator, and that it ap
peared that the intention as indicated in
_ the will was to give all the young men
associated with him enough to equal
about $1000 a year extra compensation.
If this were interpreted to read "one-fif
tieth" it would allow Mr. Manner $1000 a
year during the time he was in the service
of the deceased, but if it were to be said
â  that it meant "one-fifth," that would
â  give" him about $9000 a year extra.
Analyzing the mechanical process of
, writing the word, Mr. Young said that in
bis opinion when Mr. Heiuiy came to
"this part of the will he must nave rea
soned to himself that fiftieth ought to be
spelled phonetically, as follows: "F-I-f
fif, "V te, "e-t-h" eth. It seemed to him
that a man who wrote dead "dedd" and
debts "dets" was so far committed to the
chonetic method that he could reasona
bly be 9uppo<ea to tnink tnat "fifteth"
would spell fiftieth.
There was some suggestion that the
vowel in the last syllable was an "i" in
stead of an "c," but Attorney "W. H. H.
Hart informed the court that an enlarged
photograph had been made of the word
and that it was settled beyond question
that Mr. Hendy intended to write an "c."
Mr. Hart also directed the attention of
the court to the fact that Samuel J. Hen
dy and John Hendy, who had helped to
build up the fortunes of the dead man as
well as Mrs. Green and Mrs. McGurn,
members of the family, for whom Mr.
Hendy had great affection, had not re
ceived any stock of the Hendy Machine
Company by the terms of the will. He ar
gued that it would not be likely for the
deceased to act more liberally to a young
man who was not in any way related to
him than to his own flesh and blood. The
testimony showed, Mr. Hart said, that
Mr. Manner was a poor young feilow
when he went to work for Hendy; that
Hendy found him sitting on the steps of
the machine-shop one * morning; that
Manner told him he was "strapped" â
that is, without means or capital outside
of strong hands and a willing heart ; that
Hendy gave him employment and kept
him until his death, ten years later.
It was known that "Hendy thought
much of Mannei, but it would scarcely be
contended that he intended to give him
so much more than the other legatees
under the will. Besides, it was obviously
the intention of the testator to keep the
Hendy Machine Works in the Hendy
famhy, but if Mr. Manner were to be
awarded one-fifth of the testator's stock it
would take the control out of the hands of
the surviving members of the Hendy
family.
Attorney W. T. Baggett informed the
court that he desired to have five days in
which to file a brief in reply to the argu
ments by Mr. Young and Mr. Hart.
"That is your right," said Judge Coffey,
and the case will come up for further
hearing next Wednesday.
labacco seeds are so minute that it is
said a thimbleful will furnish enough
plants for an acre of ground.
THE DREADED CONSUMPTION
T. A. Slocnm, M. C, the Great Cheiniat
and Scientist, Will Send 1 rep, to the
Afflicted, Three Bottles of His
Newly Discovered Remedies
to Cure Consumption and
All Lang Troubles.
Nothing could be fairer, more philanthropic or
carry more joy to the afflicted, than the offer of T.
A. blocum, M. O.i of New York City.
Confident that he has discovered an absolute
cure for consumption and all pulmonary com
plaints, and to make its great merits known, he
will send, free, three bottles of medicine to any
reader of The Call who is suffering from chest
bronchial, throat and lung troubles or consump
tion.
Already this "new scientific course of melicine"
has permanently cured thousands Of apparently
hopeless cases.
The doctor considers it his religions dutyâ a
duty which he owes to humanityâ to donate hig in
fallible cure.
Offered freely, is enough to commend it, and
more so is the perfect confidence of the treat
chemist making the proposition.
He has proved the dreaded consumption to be a
curable disease beyond any doubt.
There will be no mistake in sendingâ the mis
take will be in overlooking the generous invita
tion. He baa on file in his American anc'
Kuropean laboratories testimonials of experience
from those cured in all parts of the world.
Don't delay until it is too late. Address T. A.
Slocum, .Â«. C, 98 Pine street, New York, and
wh'u wriiiui: the doctor, please give express and

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1896.
A NEW WORLD'S
TANDEM RECORD
Fast Riding of Kraft and
Dixon at the Velo
drome Track.
McFarland and Stevens Also
Bring Down Two Coast Pro
fessional Marks.
Russ, a New Rider, Beat Kenna in the
Handicap Amateur Eventâ Wells
end "Bob" Terrill Unplaced.
The third meet held at the new Velo
drome cycle racing track yesterday after
noon furnished a better day's sport than
either of the two previous ones, and the
attractive programme drew a larger crowd.
The men are steadily improving in condi
tion, and as they are now thoroughly ac
customed to the track, the racing is faster
and devoid of accidents.
Wells defeated Downing in the first heat
of the two-thirds mile scratch, profes
sional, after a hotly contested ride, show
ing that the big Bay City flier is fast
rounding into his true form.
The second heat was very prettily rid
den between Foster, Terrill, Whitman,
Boyden and Slater, and you could have
covered the ent re field with a blanket as
they crossed the tape, finishing in the or
der named in 1:36.
Neither "Bob" Terrill, Jones nor Mc-
Crea could ride fast enough to qualify in
the third heat, which was won easily by
Becker of Minneapolis in 1:38 1-5, Dow of
Seattle second.
Â£d Chapman, Olympic, paced the final,
and made it so very fast that they beat the
coast record one second. Foster had the
pole and was never headed, though closely
pressed by Terrill and Becker. Wells was
thrown out of his stride on the last turn
and could do no better than fourth.
Downing was last. The time was 1:27 1-5.
The first event of the day was the Velo
drome shield match race, between W. A.
Terrill, Bay City, and W. E. Becker of
Minneapolis. As prophesied in The Call
yesterday, Terrill forfeited to Becker to
save himself for the two-thirds mile
scratch, professional, toe purse for the
latter event being larger than that ior the
shield race. Becker rode the mile alone
unpaced to qualify for the prize, making
it in 2:2 L Terrill did not quality in his
heat of the two-thirds, however.
The two-thirds mile scratch, amateur,
Was run in five heats. Those who quali
fied for the final were: J. R. Kennu, Bay
City; G. H. Crafts and H. W. Squire*,
Acme ; Â£. F. Russ, Olympic, and B. C.
Raynaud, Bay City. The final was paced
by G. E. Kroetz, Olympic. After one
false start they got going. Kenna jumped
the pacemaker and took the lead. On the
third lap Raynaud fell, bringing Russ and
Crafts down with him. They were not
hurt and jumped on their whepls and fin
ished, Kuss getting third, Kenna and
Squires having finished ahead of him in
ihe order named. Keana's time was
1:313 5.
Dizon and Loos, amateurs, rode a tan
dem half-mile in 56 2-5 seconds, a coast
record, and within two-fifths of the world's
record.
Orlando L. Stevens of Ottumwa, lowa, a
crack Eastern professional just arrived
here, rode a half-mile exhibition, paced by
Dow and Boyden on a tandem, 56 sec
onds, a new coast record. It was a pretty
ride, his time beinu: faster than the ama
teur tandem team (Dixon and Loos) made,
and shows what speed these Eastern riders
have.
Floyd A. McFarland of San Jose, fresh
from a long season of racing on the Eastern
circuit, appeared for a mile exhibition
paced and was very cordially received,
ilis pacers were the McCrea-Ohapraan and
Dow-Boyden tandem teams. He made
the first half in :57 4-5 seconds and lost
several seconds by the poor pickup of
Chapman and McCrea. The mile was
mnde in 1:55, creating a new record and
beating Foster's performance of Thanks
giving day by a second.
George E. Dixon and Charles A. Kraft of
the Bay City Wheelmen lowered a world's
record in a five-mile tandem exhibition,
amateur, making it in 11:09 4-5. Tne in
termediate times were: One. 2:09; two,
4:212-5; three, 6:48 4-5; four, 8:55.
Kenna lowered the coast record three
seconds in the fourth beat of the half-mile
handicap amateur, riding the distance
from scratch in 1:04-45. Those who quali
fied for the final by winning their neats
were Squires, Russ, Mott, Kenna and
Chllds.
The final was a surprise for the "talent."
Every one thought Kenna had a "cinch"
on it, but Russ and Mott fought It out
with him for the entire last lap, and the
best he could get was second position.
Russ won the race, Kenna second, Mott
third. Russ is a new man on the track
and from his performances yesterday will
be a top-notcher before long, if he keeps
un his present form.
The following is the summary:

PHILBROOK'S PETITION,
Supreme Court Refused Yester
day to Grant Him a
Rehearing.
Final Ending of the Suit Which Inci
dentally Caused the Attorney's
Disbarment.
Horace W. Phil brook's petition for a
rehearing of the case of Ira G. Rankin
against Newman was dismissed yesterday
by the Supreme Court. In reality the
case had taken on the shape of Philbrook
as administrator against Newman, and
the petition was so entitled, Mr. Itaniiin
having died and Mr. Philbrook having
been substituted as administrator of the
Levinson estate.
Only two words were required to dis
miss the petition, but these are supposed
to have been sufficient to close up the
whole case, which has caused bo much
talk.
While engaged as attorney for the ex
ecutor of the Levinson estate Mr. Phil
brook made the allegations which led to
his exclusion from practicing by the Su
preme Court of this State for three years.
Since the court excluded him Mr. Phil
brook hns memorialized the court. This
memorial was not accepted. The petition
for a new hearing, which was filed a few
days ago, bore Mr. Philbrook's name, but
as executor and not as attorney.
The petition contained a reiteration of
the charges which had been originally
made by Mr. Phil brook, and they were
again made with even more force than in
the first instance. Justice Harrison was
again assailed, and the other Justices re
ceived the attention of the irate attorney.
The Justices paid attention to the peti
tion at an early date and have dismissed
it, while it is only a few days old.
The action of the Supreme Court yester
day seemingly winds up the case incourt.
Mr. Philbrook has been unable to prac
tice in the Supreme Court now for about
two years. The court possesses the power
to keep him out of the court as an attorney
until it issues an order to a.-am admit
him to practice, either being at the option
of the Justices.
Mn. Zelsler's Final Recital.
Mrs. Fannie Bloomrleld-Zeisler gave a piano
recital in the Metropolitan Temple, yesterday
afternoon, assisted by Sigmund Beel, who ap
peared with her in a Greig sonata, Op. 45, and
a sonata by Rubinstein, Op. 13. Little can be
added to what has previously been said con
cerning Mrs. Blooraneld-Zeisler's perform
ances. She is not beyond criticism. No one
is beyond that. Her rendering of a programme
made up of selections from Greijr, Godard,
d'Albert, Moszkowski, Strauss and Rubinstein
was clean-cut, sympatnetic and musicianly.
Mr. Beel played brilliantly and with fine ex
pression. Ttie audience was large and de
monstrative.
