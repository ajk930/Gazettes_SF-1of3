CHICAGO, ILL,., JULY 10. 5
ThÂ« silver monometallism In the uniform of Democrats to-day threw, down
that sturdy, honest, old farmer, Boies of Iowa; repudiated their old-time
leader and incorruptible champion, Silver Dick Bland of Missouri, and placed
at the head of their ticket an elocutionist, 37 yours old, who has won the favor
or the Populists of his state by speaking at their meetings.
New York sat in the council white-faced, sullen and silent, with a sneer on
her intellectually aristocratic lips. When she announced that she declined to
cast even one of her seventy-two Democratic votes for a freak man on a freak
platform a shower of hisses and curses fell about her head.
Blonometal lists and monomaniacs demanded that her delegation should be
.expelled from the hall. New York's retort 'was a smile, asneer and that particu
lar kind of silence which acts as the sign-post for contempt.
Senator Hill wore his white face to-day. In the .midst of the , storm he ex
hibited that peculiar smile which is suggestive of an extremely disagreeable
hereafter for the person or thing favored by it. -
- â¢ -\ltgeld and his pal, Governor Stone of Missouri, were turned down by the
defeat of Bland, and the marks of the political gamblers' thumb could be plainly
seen on their backs. Tillman, the political blackguard and. party splitter from
South Carolina, received one vote for President of the United States. ''That vote
vr;ia hissed. * - ;â¢ '. - â 
Colorado, faithful to her cause and to her favorite: son, cast her solid vote for
Senator' Teller. She was hissed until a delegate from another State . cried
"Shame '." . t . â . ' '. â '
Senator Hill and ex-Secretary Whitney went home in disgust to-night. '
' They will be heard from before November. But as the heavy tragedian's
role doe* not require him to go before the 'footlights and praise the acting of
the supernumerary it is not expected that brainy. Hill will, mount the stump
for Bryan.
The convention resumed Its session at 8 o'clock in the evening for the purpose
of nominating a Vice-President, but Governor Altgeld was not ready and an
adjournment was had until 10 o'clock to-morrow. . <-' '

HOW BRYAN WAS CHOSEN.
Supporters of Leading: Candidates
Forced to Give Way to the
Convention Clamor.
CHICAGO. 111., July 10.â William J.
Bryan of Nebraska was selected to-day as
the standard-bearer of the Democratic
party in the campaign for the Presidency
of the United States. Yesterday when the
handsome young Nebraskan mounted the
rostrum in the convention hall to close the
debate on the party platform he was con
si lered the merest possibility in the race
for the honor to be conferred. Halt an
honr later, when he concluded hia great
rhetorical effort, he had become a seem
ing probability. With the hours of the
night his chances grew, and when the con
vention resumed business this morning he
had been established as Richard P. Biand's
most formidable competitor.
As the balloting progressed his popnjar
ity among the delegates became more and
more apparent and his strength in votes
went by leaps and bounds until the culmi
nation came in the capture of Illinois and
Ohio and the withdrawal of Bland with the
consequent transfer of Missouri to the
Bryan column.
There were no glaring transparencies, no
life-sized lithographs, no special bands of
music to attract to the eloquent lawyer
and newspaper man. The modest banner
oi the William J. Bryan Club, a Nebraska
organization, was the only conspicuous
emblem of the Bryan cause.
During the night a standard had been
prepared bearing the concluding words of
Bryan's speech of yesterday â '"No crown
of thorns, no cross of gold"â and this
alone was the most suggestive outward in
dication that the Nebraskan was in the
race to stay. But it needed no artificial
means, such as these, to keep Bryan's
name to the fore. His striking presence,
his earnest bearing, his wonderful melod
iousness of Toice as exhibited in his speech,
had not faded from the minds of dele
gates and spectators, and every mention of
his name brought forth hearty cheers that
told the story of the firm hold he had upon
tbose who could make or unmake him in
his Presidential aspirations and upon the
thousands of on-lookers.
The battle of the ballots was fought
with a doegedness that showed a firm de
termination on the part of those pledged
to particular candidates to be consistent in
the desire of thÂ»>ir hearts, but little by lit
tle the standard of Bryan was pressed
nearer and nearer to the point of vantage.
At first he gained slowly, then a great
leap would be made as some delegation of
formidable numbers would throw in its
The San Francisco Call.
lot with his cohorts. The fourth ballot
was reached and the result was still un
certain, but at its end Bryan was all but
within the goal.
Delegates and audience became excited
when it became apparent that the Nebras
kan had gathered many recruits from
the Bland forces, and cheer altercheer
went up from floor and gallery. A rumor
went round the vast hall that Illinois,
consistent as Missouri in adherence to the
lifelong champion of free coinage of silver,
was wavering, and When Governor Alt
eeid and his associates withdrew for con
sultation the excitement grew to fever
heat. Change followed chance in the bal
lots cast by the various States and all
went to the man from the Platte, and
when Illinois, Ohio, and finally Missouri,
threw their strength to his support the
race had been won, and William J. Bryan
stood forth in triumph as the leader of his
party.
Exhausted Dy cheering the name of the
Nebraskan, the vast congregation in the
convention was slow to avail itself of the
opportunity for displaying the full extent
of its vigor, but It gradually rose to the
demands of the occasion, and turned loose
a volume of sound that made the iron roof
tremble in unison. Every man and
woman in the hall was standing as the
Bryan supporters on the floor grasped the
guidons indicating the positions of the
various States and marched in triumph
through the aisles bounding the square
spaces reserved lor delegates, and as the
guidons of other States joined the proces
sion the cheering became madly intense.
Bland banners, 8.-ies banners and em
blems of other candidates fell into line,
and the culminating point in the enthu
siasm was reached when the Bland band,
headed by the numerous transparencies
bearing the Missourian's name, took step
with the rest and bent their endeavors to
"Dixie's" quickstep. When it was all
over people fell back in their chairs weak
and exhausted and listened quietly to the
formalities which concluded the session.
To-night a session was held for the pur
pose of selecting tne candidate for Vice-'
President, but without proceeding to a
ballot an adjournment was forced until to
morrow at 10 a. m., when efforts will be
made to complete the business of the con
vention.

in torrid heat, un tempered by any of the
cooling breezes which have hitherto fa
vored the gathering.
The galleries' occupants were on hand
promptly ana in full force, quite prepared
to taKe charge of the proceedings, as they
did repeatedly yesterday. There were not
a dozen of the New York delegates in their
seats when the proceedings opened. Mr.
Whitney was there, but Mr. Hill was con
spicuously absent.
At live minutes before 11 o'clock Sena
tor White of California, the permanent
chairman, took the chair and made an ef
fort to establish a degree of quiet and or
der in the hall. Alter five minutes de
voted to that purpose, with very little suc
cess, prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. Gron
of Grace Episcopal Church, Cedar Rapids,
lowa, the same clereyman who officiated
the last two days.
The chair then recognized Mr. Harrity
of Pennsylvania, who, standing in the
main aisle, was greeted witti cheers. He
said:
"I desire to say that in obedience to the
instructions given by the Democratic State
Convention the Pennsylvania delegation
presents the name of Robert E. Pattison
of Pennsylvania as a candidate for the
Presidency."
The chair asked if there were any other
nominations.
Dr. Mattingly of the District of Colum
bia, from his place in the rear of the hall,
seconded the nomination of that peerless
champion of free silver, that true Demo
crat and friend of labor, John R. McLean
of Ohio.
Mr. Miller of Oregon, on behalf of that
State, nominated ex-Governor Pennoyer.
No other names being presented the
chair declared the nominations closed and,
first invoicing order, directed the secretary
to call the roll of States. But before this
was commenced Mr. Smith of Ohio in
formed the convention of the sudden de
mise of the Hon. Frank Hurd. The chair
asked if any action was desired, and Mr.
Smith said not at tbis time.
The call of the roll then commenced.
When the first State was called Chairman
Lomax of Alabama rose to say tbat John
B. Knox, H. B. Foster, S. J. Carpenter, J.
H. Minge and D. R. Burgess desired to
vote for ex-Governor William E. Russell
of Massachusetts, but under the unit rule
he cast the twenty-two votes of Alabama
for Horace Boies.
Several of the chairmen of the delega
tions injected little stump speeches into
their announcements ot the votes of the
delegation. Marsden, the "water fiend"
of Louisiana, stood up, and, holding a sil
ver dollar, said something which was
drowned in the laughter and cheers.
When Massachusetts was called a dele
gate announced that the chairman and
vice-chairman were absent, and Mr. O'Sul
livan of the delegation said that these gold
men were purposely absenting themselves.
The chair took this occasion to ask
delegates to restrain themselves from
making speeches and to confine their an
nouncements to a statement of the votes.
Michigan's delegation was polled, and
several of the delegates when their names
were called responded in loud tones: "I
decline to vote.' 1 Others simply said:
"Not voting."
Minnesota brought Adlai E. Stevenson's
name before the convention, but not a
solitary cheer greeted It.
New Jersey being reported, the chair
man of the delegaiian rose and said New
Jersey respectfully declined to vote,
whereupon the galleries broke into cheers
and hisses. The chair requested that such
demonstrations cease, and a delegate
shouted: "They are all Republicans and
ought to be put out,"
The State of New York adopted the
same course as the State of New Jersey.
On being cailed, ex-Governor Flower rose
and said: "In view of the platform
adopted by tbis convention, I am in
structed as a delegate from the State of
New York to say that the delegates have
agreed not to participate in the selection

The dark horse won. ; Bryan Hccnred the nomination as a result of bis great
speech. Before that he wag a hundred to One shot. When the silver delegates
went to bed last night they were still for Bland. When they arose Id the morn
ing they.were for, Bryan. The strength of - the Nebraskan had steadily level
oped from the hour of his magnificent defense of bimetallism.
Just think of it! He had been "turned down" by the original delegation
from his State. He was without a seat on the convention floor, and still lie

The chairman of the North Carolina
deleeation, when that State- was called,
parodied Mr. Flower's words, saying: "In
â¼iew of the platform adopted by this con
vention, lam requested by the delegates
from North Carolina to cast 22 votes for
Bryan." [Cheers and laughter.]
There was some curiosity to hear how
Ohio would vote and the chairman of the
delegation manifested a full desire to
gratify it. Standing on his chair, he be
gan a speech, stating the individual pref
erences of each delegate, mentioning him
by name, but the chairman cut this per
formance short by asking him to simply
give the totals. The Ohioan then stated
that 41 delegates were for McLean, 1 for
Bryan, 1 nothing, 1 Bland, but under the
unit rule Ohio casts its vote for the man
who made this convention possible, John
R. McLean.
The purpose of Ohio to get the individual
votes of its delegation on record was not to
be thus balKed, and a delegate challenged
the vote and a poll was had. McLean's
name being reached it was stated that he
was absent, but his alternate was here.
The alternate's name being called, he
voted for McLean.
South Carolina caused a surprise when
the chairman announced that under in
structions of her State South Carolina cast
seventeen votes for her ''honored son,"
Benjamin Tiilman, one not voting. [Hisses
and cheers.]
Mr. Powers of Utah rose to a question of
personal privilege and asked the chairman
whether the spectators in the galleries
should be permitted to express their ap
proval or disapproval of the course of dele
gates.
"A very pertinent question," the chair
man admitted, and then he added : "Pro
ceed with the rollcall."
The vote of the State of Tennessee was
challenged and the chairman asked the
delegate who demanded a poll whether he
meant to deny the accuracy of the state
ment made by the chairman of the dele

cation (Senator Bate). The delegate said
he did. The delegation being polled the
announcement of Senator Bate as to the
preferences of the delegates was fully
sustained and the presiding officer re
quested gentlemen preferring such charges
to bind themselves more accurately in the
future. [Applause.]
When the State of Wisconsin was called
a contention arose among the delegates,
some of the silver men claiming that the
unit rule did not govern their action and
the gold men (especially General Bragg
and Senator Vilas) insisting that it did
and that the instructions were printed on
the commissions of delegates. A copy of
these instructions was sent to the chair
and was read by one of the secretaries. It
declares the delegates from Wisconsin are
to vote as a unit on all subjects and candi
dates as the majority may determine.
General Bragg, in the course of a some
what angry altercation with a delegate op
posed to his views, declared that the silver
delegation from Virginia should not de
termine the course of the Democracy of
Wisconsin.
He added that at a meeting of the Wis
consin delegation yesterday twenty de
clared themselves in favor of not voting in
the convention ana four of them in favor
of voting.
The chairman instructed the secretary
to call the names of the Wisconsin dele
gates, and in response to this call General
Bragg, Senator Vilas and eighteen others
declined to vote, while four others voted.
E. J. Dockery, one of the silver delegates
from Wisconsin, mounted the stand and
argued that the instructions as read did
not authorize delegates to refrain from
voting or authorize a majority of them to
prevent a minority from voting.
General Bragg got on the chair of one
of the Texas delegates to make a speech,
but was rather rudely repulsed, where
upon Governor Hogg of Texas courteously
offered his chair, which General Bragg
courteously took. He argued that the in
structions required the vote of Wisconsin
to be cast as a unit. There had been but
four votes cast now by delegatesâ contrary

to the will of the majorityâ and those four
votes, he argued, could not bind tiie
twenty non-voters nor disgrace the State
of Wisconsin while the convention stood
under the piatform adopted by it. [De
risive cheers from the silver men of the
convention.]
The chair ruled on the point of order
raised by this discussion. He first read
again the instructions of the Wisconsin
delegation and said : "The chair rules that
these are not instructions to abstain from
voting. [Cheers.] The chair further rules
tliat when the roll is called gentlemen ab
sent shall be recorded ss absent, and that
if a majority of the delegates vote their
votes shall be individually recorded, but a
minority cannot cast the entire vote of the
delegation."
This ruling was received with applause.
The vote of Wisconsin was then an
nounced: Declining to vote 19, Bland 4,
Blackburn L
The State of Colorado, which had been
passed by consent, was called and brought
Senator Teller's name before the conven
tion. It was received with faint hisses
and very slieht applause.
Massachusetts, which had also been
passed, brought in Hill's name by casting
one vote for him.
The chair announced the result of
the first ballot as follows:! Bland
223. Bryan 105. Boies 86. Blackburn 83,
McLean 54, Matthewi 37, Campbell 2, Pat
tison 95, Pennoyer 10, Russell 2, Stevenson
2, Tiilman 17, Teller 8, Hill 1, absent and
not voting 185.
The second ballot was begun at 12 :35.
As soon as it was started Senator White
vacated the chair, placing the gavel in the
hands of Mr. Richardson of Tennessee.
South Carolina swung over from Tiilman
to Bryan, whose gain had begun early in
the balloting.
The District of Columbia manifested its
capacity for lightning changes by scatter
ing its votes as follows: Three for Bryan,
1 for Bland, 1 for Boies and 1 for McLean.
Before the vote was announced and while
it was being footed up, California an
nounced a change of her vote, as follows:
Bryan 14, Bland 2, Matthews 1, Boies 1, a
gain of 7 for Bryan.
The result of "the second ballot was an
nounced at 1:18 p. m.. as follows: Second
ballotâ Bland 281. Boies 37, Matthews 34,
McLean 53, Blackburn 41, Pattison 100,
Bryan 197, PennoyerÃ, Stevenson 10, Hill
1, Teller 8, not voting 160.
Mr. Marsden of Louisiana, the hero of
the water scene the first day of the con
vention, raised another small scene. He
rose to address the chair, and several
glasses of water were tendered him, some
of which he drank and one be threw away.
He afterward mounted the platform, and,
amid considerable confusion, said: "I
move that it is the sense of this conven
tion that the majority should rule, and
the precedent established by Democratic
conventions heretofore under the two
thirds rule is a cowardly subterfuge."
[Hisses and uproar.]
The presiding officer remarked that
while he did not think the gentleman had
made any motion, he would reconsider
and would announce that the gentleman
from Louisiana moved that the two-thirds
rule be abrogated.
Senator B lan chard said he was author
ized by the Louisiana delegation to say
that the motion of the delegate (Mr.
Marsden) was not made at its suggestion,
and he moved to lay that motion on the
table. At the same time a point of order
was made that the motion to abrogate the
two-thirds rule must be firÃt considered by j
the committee on rules, and the point of
order was sustained by the chair. There
upon, Mr. Marsden, smiling but discom
fited, retired from the platform, saying to
the chairman as be left the stand, '-You
will bear from me later,"
The third ballot was then began at 1:30
p. m.
New York on the third ballot, as on the
second, remained mute when the name of
that State was called, and the clerk re
peated the call in his loudest tone, but
without result.
The result of the third ballot was an
nounced at 1:50 p.m., as follows: Bland
29L Boies 36, McLean 54. Bryan 219, Black
burn 27. Pattison 97, Stevenson 9, Hill 1;
absent or not voting, 162.
A fourth rollcall was immediately or
dered and Senator White resumed the
chair. The result of the fourth ballot had
only been partially announced when it
was interrupted by another intensely dra
matic scene. When Bryan's gain from 219
to 280, heading Bland and all the other
candidates, was announced, by a pre
arranged plan Bryan banners were raised
on the standards of several States and
much shouting was indulged in, with a
view to stampeding the convention to bis
support.
Nevada, a McLean State; Kansas, a
Bland State; Idaho and other States that
had previously voted for other candidates,
led the movement. They were quickly
followed in the order named by New Mex
ico, California, Nevada, District of Colum
bia, Idaho, Minnesota, Washington, Vir
ginia, Indian Territory, who all raised
their standards and joined in the general
shout for Bryan.
Then a procession was started, the stand
ards of twenty-two States and Territories
being borne round the ball amid a perfect
tornado of cheering. Then Illinois joined
in and Florida followed. Ohio came in,
and a brief spell of silence followed as the
rumor passed around that a deal was on
with McLean for second place.
After fifteen minutes of this perform
ance the announcement of the result was
continued and the fourth ballot was of
ficially announced as follows: Bland 241,
Boies 33, Matthews 36, McLean 46, Bryan
280, Blackburn 27, Pattison 96. Btevenson
8, Hill 1, absent or not voting 162. Total,
930. Total number of votes cast on fourth
ballot, 768. Necessary to a choice, 512.
Immediately following the tin&l oat*
come of the fourth ballot the chairman,
Senator White of California, said that the
proceedings had reached the stage where
it was necessary for the chair to state bis
construction of the two-thirds rule.
A careful examination of the records of
Democratic conventions left but ore de
cision open to the chair. The noise and
confusion in the hall made the chairman
pause.
"Oh, gentlemen," he remonstrated, "do
keep quiet." [Cries of "Sit down, ait
down."]
The chairman resumed his statement
and said that the two-thirds rule had
been acted on without objection ever eince
its adoption in the Ohio convention in
1872. The rule read that "two-thirds of
the whoie number of votes given shall be
necessary to a nomination for President or
Vice-president. Therefore, in the opinion
of the chair, two-thirds of the votes given
would nominate the candidates for Presi
dent and Vice-President of the United
States." [Cheers.l
"Call the roll," he ordered, and the fifth
ballot was begun.
At 2:45 o'clock the fifth rollcall was be
gun and it soon became evident that Bryan
wo uld secure votes enough in this ballot to
nominate him by the necessary majority.
When Kentucky, which was one of the
States which did not join in the proces
sion, was reached, Mr. Rhea, who bad put
Senator Blackburn in nomination, rose
and said :
"While Kentucky loves her great Dem
ocrat, Joseph Blackburn, and would be
] glad to see him elected President of the
j United States yet as he served in the Con
federate army they don't seem to want
him. [Faint hisses.] Therefore Kentucky
takes pleasure in casting her twenty-six
votes for the world's greatest orator, W. J.
Bryan. 1 ' [Cheers.l
Illinois, which had asked to be passed,
cast her 48 votes for Bryan. This left him
with 44G votes, 66 short of the necessary
number. Oklahoma changed her 6 votes
I from Bland to Bryan, making 454. Then
Ohio withdrew the name of McLean and
cast 46 votes for Bryan, making his total
500. Before the result was announced,
but when it was known that Mr. Bryan
had received within a few of the neces
sary number of votes, Governor Stone of
Missouri ascended the platform and as
soon as order could be obtained he ad
dressed the convention in these words:
"Gentlemen of the convention: Two or
three days since I received this note,
which I will read in your hearing from
Richard Parks Bland: 'I wish it to be
understood that I do not desire the nomi- j
nation unless it is the judgment of the
free silver delegates that I would be the
strongest candidate. If it shall at any
time appear that my candidacy istne least
obstruction to the nomination of any can
didate who is acceptable to the free coinage
delegates of the convention, or one more
acceptable to a majority of those delegates
than myself, I wish my name, at once, un
conditionally withdrawn from further con
sideration. lam willing to waive State
instructions for me, if need be, and to let
the free silver delegates decide the whole
Matter. The cause must be put above the
man.' [Applause,]
"I came to this great city-," continued
Governor Stone, "as one of the delegates
from Missouri, voicing the sentiment of
the Democracy of that State to present for
your deliberate consideration the name of
that illustrious commoner for whom many
of you have expressed a preference by your
votes in this convention. To those who
have been our friends in this struggle I de
sire now to return my grateful thanks,
but, following the direction of Mr. Bland
himself, that whenever a majority of sil
ver delegates expressed their preference
for another, he desired nis name with
drawn, now, in the name of Missouri, I
lower the standard under which we have
fought throughout this convention, and
in its place I lift that of the gifted and
glorious son of Nebraska. [Loud and ions
continued cheering, j
"We have chosen a splendid leader,
beautiful as Apollo, intellectual beyond
comDtrison, a great orator, a great scholar,
but, above all, there is beating in his
breast a heart that throbs inconstant sym
pathy with the great masses of the people
and instinct with the highest sentiments
of patriotism. We will not only nominate
him, but I believe with as much con
fidence as 1 can believe anything in the
future, we wiii elect him by a very large 'â 
majority in November. And, gentlemen
of the convention, we will inaugurate not
only a Democratic administration at
Washington, but one that will be set down
as among the purest and ablest and the
most illustrious of American history.
"So now, gentlemen, 1 withdraw the
name of Richard Parks Bland and cast the
thirty-four votes of the State of Missouri
for William J. Bryan.''
Governor Stone was listened to with a
silente such as no other orator had been
honored with, except Mr. Bryan himself,
and at the close of his effective little speech
he was loudly cheered.
Judge Van Wagenen of lowa was next
recognized. He said the lowa delegation
bore to Chicago with them from Governor
Boies a message saying that he had only

the success of the party at heart; that he
would not be disappointed if he was
not nominated, but he would be disap
pointed if success did not come in Novem
ber. In case the delegation found when
they arrived at Chicago that some other
candidate had more votes than he then
his name was to be withdrawn. Acting
under these instructions, he formally with
drew the name of Horace Boies from the
convention and cast the twenty-six votes
of lowa for W. J. Bryan.
Senator Jones stood on his chair to an
nounce that Kansas changed her vote of
sixteen from Bland to Bryan.
Montana changed their six votes from
Bland to the winner, the chairman de
claring that it was the intention of his
State to stick to Bland from first to last,
and they had done their duty.
Senator Turpie of Indiana mounted the
platform and said, amid great noise and
confusion, that the delegates from Indiana
had stood from first to last for the distin
guished chief magistrate of Indiana, but
in view of the wave which had just swept
over the convention he was now author
ized to withdraw the name of Governor
Matthews and to cast the vote of Indiana
for William J. Bryan of Nebraska.
[Cheers.]
"In view of the u^iity which .Â«hou!d pre
vail in the convention I move that the
nomination of W. J. Bryan be made unan
imous." [Cheers. J
After the. vote of T xas had been shifted
to Mr. Bryan the chairman put the ques
tion on Senator Turpie's motion to make
the nomination unanimous, and declared
it carried, only a few votes in the negative
coming from the Pennsylvania delegation.
When the announcement was made all
order was cast to the winds. The dele
gates and the audience began to cheer and
wave hats, Hags and banners, while the
march around the sections was again
taken up, ail the State emblems being this
time carried in the procession.
A band of music entered the hall from
the vestibule and marched at the head of
the procession playing "Marching Through
Georgia" and other popular aira, in the
chorus of which many of those present
joined. "Dixie," which the band also
played, bad the usual effect of heightening
the enthusiasm and was cheered and
cheered again.
At 3:45 p. m. the sergeant-at-arms, in be
half of the chairman, succeeded in gettine
a hearing so far as to be able to announce
that the convention stood in recess until
8 p.m.
GRAND EVENING CIRCUS.
Bltter Words Exchanged and a De
sire Shown to Cut Loose From
Boss Altsreld.
CHICAGO, 111., July 10.â The proceed
ings of the evening were opened a few
minutes before 9 p. m., when Senator White
of California, the chairman, called the
convention to order. At that time ex-
Governor Flower and a fair proportion of
the New York delegates were occupying
seats in their section. Senator Hill and
Mr. Whitney having left the city in the
afternoon. Moat of the New Jersey dele
gates weie also present. The fact that
both these State delegations had declined
to participate in the balloting for the
Presidential candidate made their pres
ence to-night a matter of remark.
The chairman announced that after the
nomination for Vice-President should be
made (whenever that might be) the com
mittee on notification would at once meet
in the rooms of "the committee on resolu
tions" to the right of the chair. He then
stated that General Bragg of Wisconsin
desired to make some remarks, and he ac
cordingly introduced the general to the
convention. General Bragg said:
"I rise, Mr. Chairman, on a question of
State privilege. When the delegation of
Wisconsin was to-day engaged in private
consultation as to what should be done by
it in the future some gentleman (I suppose
he was a gentleman ; in fact I know him to
be such) stole the colors of onr State and
passed them as the representation of my
delegation and of my State into the trail
of the victor for whom we had re
fused to cast our votes. I make this
statement, not in ordaj to cast a reflection
on "anybody, but simply to place the Slate
which I represent as its chairman right,
â o that the record will show that we trailed
not the Wisconsin 'badger' behind the
votes of a majority of this convention."
[Cheers.]
Mr. Dockery attempted to take the stand
to answer General Bragg's remarks, and as
the two Wisconsin antaconiels confronted
each other, General Bragg shook his finger
in Mr. Dockery's face, and said : "If you
make any personal remarks about me you
will suffer for it."
The chairman remarked that whatever
asperity might exist between the gentle
men from Wisconsin ought not to enter
into a National convention. He was satis
fied that the gentlemen in the end would
be found supporting the ticket, and he re
fused to recognize Mr. Dockery for the
pnrpose of addressing the convention.
Mr. Dockery then left the stand and this
terminated the incident.
Governor Stone of Missouri was next
recognized to move an adjournment. He
said the work thus far done had been, in
his judgment, well done, but they had yet
to name an associate for their great leader
on the ticket. He believed this was an
important work, which should not be
hastily or inconsiderately performed. It
should, ou the contrary, be performed in
the most mature and deliberate manner
possible, and to the end that the delega
tions might have the opportunity to con
fer with each other and arrive at a con
clusion which in the end would strengthen
the ticket, and, in order that no mistake
might be made, he moved that the con
vention do now adjourn until 12 o'clock
Jo-morrow. The galleries, which were
densely packed, and which to a greater
extent before than last night undertook to
take charge of the proceedings, here in
terposed a loud chorus of noes.
Henry of Mississippi moved to make
the hour 10 o'clock. Governor Stone ac
cepted the amendment.
Khea of Kentucky made the point
of order that the motion had not been
seconded, but the chair, disregarding the
point, ordered the secretary to call the
roll.
The first open revolt in the convention
against the domination of Governor John
P. Altgeld manifested itself when the
Governor, in his capacity as chairman of
the Illinois delegation, announced the
forty-eight votes of the State for adjourn
ment. Harry Donovan of Chicago, who
has been a Boies man from the start,
jumped up to challenge the accuracy of
the count. His note of defiance was re
calved with applause from the Chicago
crowds in the gallery, who understood the
situation, and cheers followed each negaÂ«
tive vote. Metropolitan and country
delegates who had been lukewarm in their
obedience of the Governor's will and rest
less en numerous occasions voted against
adjournment. The vote was: 24 ayes, 11
nays, 13 absent.
Under the unit rule this vote was made
48 ayes, but Mr. Donovan and others dis
puted its correctness, shouting that it took
25 votes to make a majority. .
"What's the matter with Illinois now?"
inquired the chair good-uaturedly, and
closed the incident by ruling in favor of
the Governor.
The audience followed the taking of the
vote with quite as much interest as it had
shown on the questions on the platform
and the balloting for a Presidential candi
date, and whenever any delegation voted
"no" on the question of adjournment the
vote was greeted with loud cheers.
However, when the call of the roll had
proceeded far enough to show that the

By reason of the very general belief that the nomination of William J. Bryan for
President of the United States by the Democratic National Convention at Chicago was
Jargelv effected by bis famous speech for silver, the subject of National Convention
oratory take? on new Interest. Mr. Bryan is not the first orator who has by well
rounded periods awakened the enthusiasm of delegates. Below are submitted extracts
from various convention orations, including some of the more striking passages of Mr.
Bryan's address.
I would be presumptuous indeed to present myself against the distinguished gentleman to
Whom you have listened if this were but a measuring of ability; but this is not a contest of
persons. The humblest citizen in ail the land, when clad in the armor of a righteous cause,
ger than all ihe hosts of error that they can bring. I come to speak to you in defense
of a cause as holy as the came of libertyâ the cause of humanity. When this debate is con
motton will be mnde to lay upon the table the resolutiou offered in commendation of
the iidmlnMration, an'i aiso the resolution in condemnation of the administration. I shall
... bringinj; this question dowu to the level of persons. The individual is but an atom.
Ho is born, he" acts, he dies. But principles are eternal, and this has been a contest of princi
ples. * â¢ ' * We do not come as aggressors. Our war is not a war of conquest. We are fight
ing tor our homes, our families and prosperity. We have petitioned and our entreaties hive
sregarded. We have be? Red and they have mocked, and our calamities became worse.
We beg no longer. We entreat no more. We petition no more. We defy them.
The gentleman from Wisconsin has said he fears a Robespierre. My friends, in this land of:
the free, you need fear no tyrant who will spring up from among the people. What we need is
an Andrew Jackson to stand, as .iHckson did, against the encroachments of aggrandized
wealth. â¢ â¢ â¢ Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests, and
all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for the gold standard by saying to
them. You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not
crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.â William J. Bryan at Chicago.
I propose to present to the thoughtful consideration of the convention the name of one
â who, on the field of battle was styled "The Superb," yet won the still nobler renown as a
military Governor, whose first act, when in command of Louisiana and Texas was to salute
motion for adjournment was to prevail,
the crowds, without waiting for the ter
mination of the vote, determined not to
"stand upon the order of their going, bnt
to go at once," and so they began an in
formal and rather tumultuous withdrawal.
The clerk went on with the rollcall and
did not always wait for a reply, but set
down the State as voting "aye," and in
this way the result was arrived at and was
announced as carried in the affirmative.
The chairman then stated, at 9:30 p. m.,
that the convention was adjourned until
10 a. m. to-morrow.
FOR VICE-PRESIDENT.
Conference of the Leaders Held,
but an Understanding Is
Not Reached.
CHICAGO, 111., July 11.â A conference
on the Vice-Presidential nominee was held
at the Sherman House to-night. Nearly
every State except the gold States was
represented. Governor Stone of Missouri,
Governor Altgeld of Illinois, Senator
Daniel of Virginia and other prominent
leaders were present.
It was nearly 11 o'clock before the meet
ing got under way. The door was care
fully guarded and little leaked out as to
the deliberations.
John R. McLean. Governor Matthews,
G # . Fred Williams and Joseph Sibley were
talked of, as were others who have been
mentioned in connection with the second
place on the ticket. The relative streneth
of each man was considered and a mes
sage was sent over to Mr. Bryan to learn
his position in regard to the men most
talked of.
At 12:30 a. m. no decision had been
reached as to who should be placed in
nomination. The concensus of opinion
was that candidates from the South and
from States east of the Alleghenies were
unavailable. This practically killed the
chances of Sibley and Sewell of Maine,
George Fred Williams and the several can
didates from the South.
The split in the Ohio delegation, which
was divided between John R. McLean and
Allen W. Thurman, made it unlikely that
either of these candidates would be se
lected.
Governor Mattnews of Indiana seemed
to stand the test of criticism better than
rr.ost of the other candidates. Governor
Altgeld discussed the qualifications of ex-
Conpressmar Fithian of Illinois and C. K.
Ladd and J. R. Williams of the same
fc-tate.
BRYAN IS CONSIDERATE.
In the Event of Election He Will
â¢ Not Be a Candidate for a
â â¢:â .; Second Term.
CHICAGO, 111., July 10.â William Jen
nings Bryan, the nominee of to-day's con
vention, heard' the news at his rooms in
the Clifton House, and received it without
any apparent show of feeling. His wife
was not present to greet him, for, she wit
nessed the extraordinary demonstration
in the hall that stampeded the convention
to the standard of her husband.
Together with a few friends Mr. Bryan
received bulletins ' that told him of every
move made in the political game being
played at the Coliseum. At this distance,
unmoved by the stirring scenes enacted on
the floor of the convention, Mr. Bryan was
able .to analyze the situation figure
out the. victory that appeared to be within
his grasp at an early hour this morning. y
A party or newspaper men r were the
first to congratulate after the reception of
the bulletin announcing his nomination.
As the men' gathered about him to shake
hands, Mr. Bryan, reached for a .piece of
paper and wrote the following, which he
said was intended for the American peo
ple: . â  .-' .;â 'â â¢;â â¢'â¢ â¢â  < i â â '
"In order that I may have no ambition
but to discharge faithfully the duties of
the. office, I desire to announce that if
elected, I shall under no circumstances be
a candidate for re-election."
"This is not a sudden resolution on my
part," said Mr. Bryan. "I have had it in
my mind ever since my nomination has
been considered by my friends as a possi
bility. I believe it is a good principle for
me to follow, and l shall live up to it.
The Presidency is the highest honor that
can be bestowed upon any human being
by his country, and . the power placed in
the hands of the President of the United
Slates is so ereat that there "should be no
temptation thrown in his > way to cause
him to use it for his personal advancement.
.''Mr. Cleveland, in bis first letter of.ac
ceptanci?,'set forth the objections to a sec- i
ond term in language -so forcible that it j
cannot be surpassed. President Haves ad- i
vocated an amendment to the constitution
making the chief executive of the United
States , inelieible , for re-election, and a
similar amendment was advocated by
President Andrew Jackson.' .-.'â :
"I desire to express my deep apprecia
tion of the kindness shown to me by other
candidates." My nomination is due to the
peculiar . circumstances which surround
this campaign and not to any superior
merit. ,In ..fact, had the convention con
sjdered who was most deserving the lot
would ' have fallen upon another. Iso j
highly appreciate the ':â ' re'sp'oh si bilty.-^ im- J
posed by this nomination that * : I/Â» have I
avoided making any promises or pledges
to any person."
â¢After indicating this declaration Mr.
Bryan accepted the congratulations that
were tendered," and in â¢; a~, few moments it
was apparent that the room would' not
accommodate those who were surging to i
eet in. In response to appeals Mr. Bryan j
took a position in the lobby and for almost
an hour shook; bands 'with Â£ the crowds as
they passed in line. ; :
?â¢ Mr. . Bryan was forced to say a few
words. He < declared 'he felt Vhig i j ly. hon- j
ored by the convention, but ) asserted that
no words of his ; could add to the work of j
' * InFTnrai^MwAwiMWHiiiiawiitwiftJii ml nil' >Â»iii win i m
the convention. The convention, however,
was but the beginning, and whether its
action was wise or not could only be de
termined in November next.
It was not for him to say whether the
convention had acted wisely, t>ut it was
his duty and all those who agreed with
him to back up the convention and the
platform and make the election sure. Mr.
Bryan closed bis short but felicitous
speech with an injunction to those pres
ent who believed in the Democratic party
to make it their business to see that its suc
cess was assured this fall.
During the course of the evening Mr.
Bryan was visited by several hundred
people, prominent among whom were
many of the delegates of the convention.
Visiting clubs also called at the hotel
and clamored for a speech from their new
candidate. Mr. Bryan was compelled to
make three short addresses during tbe
evening. One of them was to the Bland
Club of Kansas City, Mo. In his speech
Mr. Bryan complimented Mr. Bland as
the pioneer in the fight for free silver, and
stated that it was his generosity in with
drawing that enabled liim to become the
nomine? of the convention.
Mrs. Bryan held an impromptu reception
In tbe parlors during the evening, quite a
number of ladies of Chicago paying their
respects to her. It is the present pro
pram me of Mr. Bryan to leave thÂ« city to
morrow, accompanied by his wife, and go
to Salem, 111., his old home, where he will
spend a week, at the expiration of which
I time he will go to Lincoln, Nebr., where
he will receive the formal notice of his
nomination.
Within a few minutes after the nomina
tion was announced telegrams of congratu
lation began to pour into the hotel. They
were from all parts of the country. Among
them were several from Republican and
Populist leaders, especially in the Western
States, all pledging support for Mr. Bryan
in the coming campaign. Among the
telegrams were the following:

WILD WITH ENTHUSIASM.
Omaha People Suitably Celebrate
the Nomination of the Editor-
Statesman.
OMAHA, Nebr., July 10.â From the
time the convention opened in Chicago
this morning there were crowds at all the
bulletin boards. In front of the World-
Herald office, of which paper Mr. Bryan is
editor, the street was packed with a surg
ing mass of humanity, and bulletins were
posted and announced by men stationed
at different points in front of the building.
As each cain for Bryan caiue in it was
greeted with mighty cheers.
Though not unexpected, when the first
balletion saying "Bryan is nominated"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1896.
the constitution by proclaiming that the military rule shall ever be subservient to the civil
power. The plighted word of a soldier was proved by the acts of a statesman. I nominate one
whose name will suppress all factions, will be alike acceptable to the North and to the
Southâ a name that will thrill the Republic, a name, if nominated, of a man that will crush,
the last embers of sectional strife, and whose name will be hailed as the dawning of the day of
perpetual brotherhood. With him we can fling away our shields and wage an aggressive war.
We can appeal to the supreme tribunal of the American people against the corruption of the
Republican party and their untola violations of constitutional liberty. With hhn as our
chieftain, the bloody banner of the Republicans will fall from their palsied hands. Oh, my
countrymen, in this supreme moment the destinies of the Republic are at stake and the
liberties of the people are imperiled. The people hang breathes on your deliberation. Take
heed! Make no misstep! I nominate ona who can carry every Southern State, and who can
carry Pennsylvania, Indiana, Connecticut and New Yorkâ the soldier statesman, with a record
as stainless as his swordâ Win field Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania. If elected he will take his
seat.â Daniel Dougherty, at Cincinnati, 1880.
I have witnessed the extraordinary scenes of this convention with deep solicitude. No
emotion touches my heart more quickly than a sentiment in honor of a great and noble
character. But as I sat on these seats and witnessed these demonstrations it seemed to me you
were a human ocean in a tempest. I have seen the sea lashed into a fury and tossed into a
spray, and it? grandeur moves the soul of the dullest man. But I remember that it is not the
billow*, but the calm level of the sea, from which all heights and depths are measured. When
the storm has passed and the hour of calm settles on the oceanâ when sunlight bathes its
smooth surface â then the astronomer takes the level from which he measures all terrestrial
heights and depths. â¢ â¢ â¢ Not here in this brilliant circle, where 15,000 men and women
are assemDled, is the destiny of the Republic to be decreed; not here, where I see the
enthusiastic faces of 756 delegates wailing to cast their votes into the urn ana determine the
choice of the party, but by 4.000,000 RepuDlican firesides, where the thoughtful fathers, with
wives and children about them, with the calm thoughts inspired by love of home and love of
country, with the history of the past, the hopes of the future and the knowledge of the great
men who have adorned and blessed our Nation in days gone byâ there God prepares the
verdict that shall aetermine the wisdom of our work to-night. In the silence of deliberation
will this great question be settled.â James A. Garfield, nominating John Sherman at Chicago,
1880.

came the crowd seemed stunned for a
moment and then went wild, the demon
stration growing and continuing for half
an hour.
Crowds packed the streets until a late
hour, keeping up the enthusiastic cheer
ing. Since the evening set in there has
been a continuous celebration all over the
city. Stocks of fireworks left over from
the Fourth are being used up, principal
corners are illuminated with red fire, flags
are flying and the whole city is being dec
orated.
In all of this demonstration Republicans
and Populists are taking an active part,
and declare that they want to take part
and assist in the ovation which will be
tendered Mr. Bryan when he reaches
Omaha.
To-night in one of the opera-houses a
large meeting was turned into an im
promptu ratification meeting of the nomi
nation, every mention of Bryan's name
bringing forth the pent-up enthusiasm of
the audience. His welcome home will be
by far the largest affair of the kind ever
witnessed in the city.
To-night everybody, without respect to
politics or anything else, is celebrating as
the fancy strikes him. Several Bryan
yells are heard on the streets, and every
body is shaking hands and congratulating
everybody else, whether friend or stran
ger. It is a tribute to Bryan's personal
popularity among all classes, and an ex
pression of gratification at the honor done
one of Omaha's citizens. Nothing ap
proaching or like it has ever been wit
nessed in the city.
IT PLEASES LEWELLING.
Bryan's Nomination Meets the Ap
proval of the Ex-Governor
of Kansas.
WICHITA, Kans., July 10.â Ex Gov
ernor Lorenzo D. Le welling of this city,
who is a delegate-at- large to the Populist
convention at St. Louis, is highly pleased
with the nomination of Bryan. In an in
terview with The Call correspondent to
night he said:
"It is probably the best nomination that
could have been made, and I can see no
reason why it should not be eminently
satisfactory to the Populists throughout
the United States. The position he has
maintained on tne silver question and
other questions which are uppermost in
the minds of the people have made him
no uncertain candidate. He represents
many of the ideas for which the Populists
are contending.
"He is a Western man and knows the
wants of the people of the West, who are
the chief sufferers under the present condi
tions. The platform is more than could
have been expected and all that could have
been desired under the circumstances and
I am personally in favor of the indorse
ment of Mr. Bryan by the St. Louis Popu
iist Convention.
"Considering the fact that he is a young
man, that he is Western man, and that he
is the first man who has ever been named
for the high office of President west of the
Mississippi River, I believe his candidacy
will appeal to the votes of the States that
are absolutely necessary for his success in
the coming campaign. His brilliancy and
occasional magnetism make him an ideal
candidate, especially when hi 3 integrity
and personal worth cannot be ques
tioned."
"It is measures, and not men, for which
we have contended, and if we do not get
all the measures which have been sought,
we will, by the election of Bryan, at least
be able to strike a light by which we shall
see our way clear to the ultimate triumph
of the people over their oppressors.' 1
The ex-Governor has sent his congratu
lations and tender of support to the nomi
nee.
GREAT JOY IN NEBRASKA.
Residents of Lincoln Wtll Give
Bryan a Great Reception Upon
His Return.
LINCOLN, Nebr., July 10.â The enthu
siasm at Chicago and in the Democratic
Convention hall itself could not have been
much greater over the nomination of
Hon. W. J. Bryan for the Presidency than
here at bis home. The result was in a
measure anticipated since yesterday when
his epeech closing the debate on the adop
tion of the platform and the demonstra
tion following almost stampeded t lie con
vention and launched him firmly as a pos
sibility. But with the temper of the dele
gates not well understood at this distance
there was enough of the element of doubt
to keep his friends and supporters on the
tiptoe of expectancy from the time the
convention met until the result of the fate
ful filth ballot was flashed from the wires.
Then Bedlam broke loose.
At the Democratic headquarters on
Eleventh street, in the heart of the busi
ness district, where a crowd running into
the thousands had gathered and remained
since the first bulletins began to arrive,
the effect was magical. "Bryan is nomi
nated" came the word, quickly |followed by
the announcement "by acclamation."
The cheers that followed were deafening.
They swept across the big room, out into
the open, dashed themselves against the
brick walls across the street and rolled
back in echoing reverberation.
The whole city seemed to catch the con
tagion. Republicans shonted as lustily as
Democrats, and Populists vied with their
Prohibition brethren in attempting to
outdo the other in making noise. Every
whistle was set screeching, bells were rung
and the bands played. Five minutes after
the result was officially announced a
parade was formed and the jubilation
began in earnest A big cannon was un
asrthed somewhere and carried bodily into
the public square to be utilized in adding
to the din. No attempt was - made at
speech making, that being reserved for a
later date.
When the first burst of enthusiasm had
in a measure subsided preparations were
begun for a more elaborate demonstration
on the return of the Nebraska delegation,
accompanied, it was hoped, by Mr. Bryan
himself. The pent-up feelings of the
people, however, were not allowed to wane
and throughout the evening and far into
the night the sound of marching shouters
was heard. Among all classes of people,
even the more moderate political enemies
of Mr. Bryan, there was a feeling manifest
of mutual congratulation, "It is a great
thing for Lincoln, a marked honor for
Nebraska," was the universal comment,
and this sentiment seemed to find an echo
everywhere. From ail over the State
came messages of congratulation to friends
of the nominee.
On the return of the Nebraska leader it
is proposed to have a State demonstration
in Lincoln which will outshine anything
of a like nature ever held within her
limits. The first step in this direction
will be taken to-night, but, of course, will
be subject to the approval and suggestion
of the delegation on its return from Chi
cago. None of Mr. Bryan's immediate
family are in the city, his wife and three
children accompanying him to Chicago,
and the hundreds who were unaware of
this and who early hastened to the modest
home at Sixteenth and D streets to offer
congratulations were obliged to postpone
the pleasant duty until a later date.
REJOICING IN UTAH.
Both Republicans and Democrats
Unite in Expressing: Joy Over
the Nomination.
SALT LAKE, Utah, July 10.â The town
is wild with enthusiasm for Bryan. Can
nons are being fired and fireworks sent up.
General rejoicing, in which Democrats
and Republicans uni*e, is the order.
Ninety-five per cent of the prominent Re
publicans of this city, on being inter
viewed, declare they will support Bryan
and free silver. Judge Goodwin, editor of
the bait Lake Tribune, the leading Re
publican paper of the State, says:
"Bryan is the best man named in the
convention. He will come nearer getting
the indorsement of the Populists, will
come nearer harmonizing all the elements
of the Democratic party than any man
who could have been selected from among
the names which went before the conven
tion, and I believe be will be elected. I
believe he will carry every State west of
the Allegheny Mountains."
OGDEN, Utah. July 10*â Ogden City
and Northern Utah have gone absolutely |
wild with enthusiasm at the nomination
of Bryan fnr President. When the an
nouncement came from the wires the
enormous crowds which were gathered in
front of the telegraph office broke out
with cheer after cheer. The entire city is
awake to-night and meetings are being
held to Drepare for the grandest ratifica
tion meeting ever held in the State. Re
ports from all over the State indicate that
Bryan is the man of all men for Utah cit
izens, regardless of party. All the little
towns are enthusiastic in their demonstra
tions, and the coming few days will usher
in one grand continuous ratification of the
youthful candidate from Nebraska.

or in peace, his name is the most illustrious borne by any living man; his services attest his
greatness, and the country knows them by heart. His fame was born not alone of things writ

search in vain in the future, as they have searched in vain in the past, for any other on whom
the Nation leaus with such confidence and trust. â¢ * â¢ Never having had a policy to enforce
against the will of the people, he never betrayed a cause or a friend, and the people will never
betray or desert him. Vilified and reviled, aspersed by numberless Dresses, not in
other lands, but in his own, the assaults upon him have strengthened and seasoned his hold
upon the public heart. The ammunition of calumny has all been exploded, the powder has all
been burned once, its power is expended, and Grant's name will glitter as a bright and imper
ishable star in the diadem of the Republic when those who have tried to tarnish it will have
moldered in forgotten graves and their memories and epitaphs have vanished utterly.
Never elated by success, never depressed by adversity, he has ever, in peace and in war,. shown
the very genius of common sense.â Roscoe Conkling, nominating U. S. Grant, 1880.
The Republicans of the United States demand a man who knows that prosperity andire-
Bumption, when they come, must come together; that when they come they will come hand in
hand through the golden harvest fields; hand in hand by the whirling spindles and the turn

down the halls of the American Congress ana threw his shining lance rail and fair against

leader upon the Held of battle. â¢ â¢ â¢ Gentlemen of the convention, in the name of the

fore the bulletin boards cheered the nomi

something about the man before commit
ting themselves. A few hours later the
Denver public had satisfied themselves of
his silver record, and they now talk of
majorities for him ranging from 25,000 to
85,000 votes. A classmate of Bryan in
Union College Law School practicing here
states that fearlessness and loyalty to prin
ciples are his leading characteristic traits.
"It will now be a contest of the people
against money," said D. H. Moffat, presi
ident of the First National Bank. "I am
glad that they have named a candidate
whose personal character is beyond re
proach and whose life has been clean.
Although a Republican I can vote for him,
and Colorado will, of course, give him a
great majority."
Governor Mclntyre, Republican, says:
"Bryan is magnetic and he will put plenty
of enthusiasm in the campaign. His silver
record will elect him."
Nearly every town in the State to-night
is celebrating the nomination by out-of
door mass-meetings.
COAST SENTIMENT.
Democrats, Populists and Bolting
Republicans Applaud the
Nomination.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 10.â The
nomination of Bryan at Chicago to-day
seems to give great satisfaction to the rank
and rile of Democrats in this city, but
what is somewhat surprising is that Popu
lists and bimetallists are equally delighted
with the nomination and ao not hesitate
to express the opinion that Bryan will re
ceive the indorsement of their parties at
St. Louis on the 22d inst.
A Call correspondent met Hons. Enoch
Pepper and J. T. Savage, both Popnlistic-
Bilver leaders, soon after the announce
ment of Bryan's nomination, and asked
them what they thought of it. Pepper
replied:
"It is a capital nomination, from the
standpoint of Populists and free-silver
men. Bryan is an able and aggressive
young man and one of the first and most
eloquent defenders of the white metal.
Support him? Of course I can, with
heart and soul."
Mr. Savage, who listened to these re
marks, added : "Yes, Bryan is really a
Populist anyway, and will without doubt
get the St. Louis indorsement."
Colonel John R. Berry, delegate-at-large
to the bimetallists' convention at St.
Louis, said: "It is the best thing Demo
crats could have done. Bryan is an able
and courageous champion of the white
metal and will unquestionably be indorsed
by the free-silver men at St. Louis. While
I was sure he would be acceptable to the
bimetallists I am surprised to learn that
both wings of the Populists here are for
the silver-tongued orator of the Platte."
Hubbard and Love, silver men ana dele
gates to the bimetallist convention, are
delighted with Bryan's nomination.
PORTLAND, Or., July 10.â The news of
Bryan's nomination was hailed by bul
letin-board crowds with manifestations of
joy, and the concensus of opinion among
Democrats is that he is the "ideal candi
date." Napoleon Davis, secretary of the
Democratic State Central Committee, said
to a United Press representative to-night:
"In my opinion no nomination has ever
been made by the Democratic party that
will give such universal satisfaction to the
rank and file of the Democracy as that of
W. J. Bryan, and especially to the
younger members of the party. Already
here in Oregon there is an evidence of
enthusiasm that has never been called
forth by the nomination of any other can
didate. Young men of all parties agree
that Bryan is an ideal candidate and a
man who, if elected to the position for
which he has been nominated, would
recognize the young men of the Nation as
no other man has ever done."
"While the Democracy of Oregon is dis
appointed in that ex-Governor Pennoyer
did not receive the nomination, it feels
that it could not have fallen to any other
man more acceptable than Bryan as a sec
ond choice."
RENO, Nkv., July 10.â The nomination
of Bryan was received with general satis
faction by Democrats and silver men of
Reno. The booming of guns to-night be
cause of the nomination showed their ap
preciation.
The Silver party members here seem to
be a unit in a demand that their National
Convention indorse Bryan's nominatiou.
J. B. McCulloueh, chairman of the Popu
list State Central Committee and one of
the delegates to the National Convention,
stated to a correspondent this evening
that the nomination of Brvan was even
more satisfactory to him than if Teller
had been named, and he would use every
effort for his indorsement by the Populist
National Convention.
George Peckham, Populist candidate for
\Governor at the last general election;
Hon. Benjamin Curler, late candidate for
District Judge; William Thompson and
B. F. Curler, delegates to the Populist
National Convention ; J. M. McCormack
and other prominent Populists are loud in
tdeir advocacy of Bryan's cause.
SEATTLE, Wash., July 10.â Three dele
gates â Richard Winsor, Colonel J. H.
Todd and E. \V. Wayâ to the National
Populist Convention, this afternoon, upon
the announcement of Bryan's nomination
sent the nominee this telegram, which
was signed also by eight other leading
Pooulists of Western Washington:
Populist friends send congratulations and
city wild with delight
Hon. John Wiley, Colonel George G-
Lyon, ex- Mayor Harry White and other
boUinc Republicans wired as follows:
Seattle friends send congratulations. Wash
ington is yours.
Bryan's nomination appears to have
. been received throughout the entire State
with marked satisfaction on the part ot
the Democrats. This is especially trae of
Seattle, where the applause and demon
strations following the announcement
were vigorous and hearty. Leading Popu
lists and bolting silver Republicans almost
to a man expressed their approval of the
result, and openly declare that they believe.
Bryan will either be indorsed or nom
inated outright at St. Louis.
PHCENIX, Ariz., July NXâ When the
news cf Bryan's nomination was an
nounced, the general verdict of the silver
ites was that an ideal candidate bad been,
selected. He is liked more than Bland.
Populists, silver men and Democrats all'
favor Bryan, who last spring won their
hearts in an impassioned silver speech.
Of the Â«ix candidates presented Bryan*
was by all odds the choice of the people
of this city. Phcenix will ratify to-morrow
night with the biggest demonstration ever
given in the Territory.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 10.â The People's
Party Club of this city is opposed to the
National Convention, which meets in St.
Louis, indorsing the Democratic candidate
for President. Last evening the club
adopted the followine resolution.
Resolved, That it is the sense of thistrtub that
we are unalterably opposed to the indorse
ment of any Democrat for President of the
United States, as such action would be equiva
lent to indorsing the inconsistent stand of the
Democratic party on all great political-ques
tions.
BAKERSPIELD, Cal., July 10vâ The
Democrats here received the nomination
of Bryan with great enthusiasm. They
held a ratification meeting with music,
fireworks and speeches by prominent
Democrats to-night. A number of men
who have been leaders in the Populist
movement have declared that they are
going back into the old party ranks again.
WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN.
Sketch of the Life of the Nebraska
Statesman Nominated for
the Presidency.
History has repeated itself in the in
stance of the nomination by the Demo
cratic National Convention of William
Jennings Bryan of Nebraska for President
of the United States. Sixteen years ago in
a Republican National Convention James
A. Garfield made a speech nominating
John Sherman of Ohio. The cheering del
egates forgot Sherman and, charmed by
eloquence, named the gifted orator, Gar
lield, the standard-bearer of the party.
Thursday morning the nomination of
Richard Parks Bland for President by the
Democratic National Convention seemed
to be a foregone conclusion. Bryan was
hardly mentioned as a dark horse. Thurs
day the "Black Eagle of Nebraska,"- as ha
is called at home, addressed the Chicago
convention, and his eloquence carried him
at once from a place in the ranks to the
top of the wave of popularity and stam
peded the delegates in his favor. He was
not an active candidate prior to Thursday;
not one shouted for him on that morning,
but that night the whole convention
shouted "Bryan." The candidate is ten
years younger than Grant was when ha,
ran for President the first time. William
J. Bryan is only 36 years of age. He hasi
been championing the cause of free silver,
for the last fifteen years.
William Jennings Bryan was born in/
Salem, 111., March 19, 1860. He was grad-.
uated from Illinois College at Jacksonville
in 1881. To make his way through the.
Union College of Law at Chicago he,
worked in Lyman Trumbull's law office
and became a favorite with that distin
guished jurist.
From his earliest years' he had a fancy
for public speaking, which developed his
oratorical powers. In 1880 he won second
prize as the representative of Illinois Col
lege in the State collegiate oratorical con
test. He was valedictorian of his college
class and came within one vote of being
elected to the position in the law school.
From 1880 he spoke in political campaigns.
NEW TO-OAT.
Success.
The people believe in Roos Bros. We
are drawing big trade with our special
sale of $16 to $20 suits at $15â when the
glittering, glaring offers of "one-half" or
"one-third" value are leaving the stores
of would-be competitors lonesome and
deserted.
No fakish, fanciful bargains to draw an
unreasoning buyer, .but a reasonable re-
auction that appeals to men of common-
sense.
Success in such a case is absolute proof
that the reductions are genuine and the
goods first class.
Sale continued until further notice.
We'll make it more spicy with a lioeral
seasoning of $22 50 and $30 suits to go with
the others at
$15.
3In 1887 he removed to Lincoln, Nebr.. and
formed a law partnership with a fellow
classmate. "I don't think that lellow
knows much law," said a veteran practi
tioner concerning Bryan soon after the
latter began to practice, "but he can talk
like tbe devil."
Bryan supported J. Sterling Morton for
Congress in 1888. The latter was defeated
by 3500 votes. In 1890 Bryan himself ran
in the same district against the same
opponent. He challenged his adversary
to a series of joint debates, and made so
brilliant a showing that he carried the
district, which had gone 3500 Republican
at the former election, by a majority of
6700 votes.
The fame he gained in these joint de
bates, of which the tariff was the theme,
induced Speaker Crisp to appoint Bryan
on the Ways and Means Committee, an
honor which many Congressmen have
schemed years to secure. On March 12,
1892, he scored his first great oratorical
success in Congress in a speech on the
tariff. The reapportionment in 1891 di
vided Bryan's Congressional district in
such a way that it made his canvass en
tirely new, but Bryan was elected, turjiing
a Republican majority into a Democratic
plurality of 140.
That the Democratic Presidential candi
date possesses the gift of eloquence in a
rare degree nobody who has heard him
will deny. Wlien he toured the leading
States of the South and the West last year
in behalf of free silver he received gener
ous notices from the press for his silvery
tongued oratory. His visit to San Fran
cisco last September was made a prominent
occasion by local adherents of the wbice
meta', and he did not fail to enthuse the
large audience which gathered to hear him
at Metropolitan Temple. During that
visit Mr. Bryan delivered addresses on the
silver question at Berkeley and Stanford
universities, and the students of those
.universities gave him- warm receptions
and applauded his outbursts of eloquence.
The silver qnestion is Mr. Bryan's
favorite theme, but he can Â«tir a congre
gation of church people with a sermon as
easily as he can move a convention with
sounding platitudes. He frequently
preaches lay sermons in one church or an
other in his Nebraska home, ana the re
ligious folk thereabout have often ex
pressed the belief tbat tbe pulpit lost a
most effective exborter when Bryan took
to law and politics.
In the last State campaign in Nebraska,
in 1894, Bryan posed as a candidate for
the United States Senate, and stumped
the State in behalf of the Democratic leg
islative ticket. The avowed candidate on
the part of the Republicans of tbat State
was Hon. John M. Thurston. Bryan
challenged Thurston to a joint debate on
tbe issues of the day, and the speeches of
these men created much interest at the
time. The joint debates occurred at Omaha
and Lincoln.
Bryan was eloquent, as usual, but Thur
ston was more than his match in sound
logic, and at all events a Republican Legis
lature was chosen, and to-day Mr. Thur
ston wears the Senatorial toga for which
William Jennings Brvan strove in vain.
The subject of this sketch is sometimes
alluded to as a journalist. The reason for
this is that his name has appeared as
editor-in-chief of the Omaha World-Her
ald. His duties have not been wearing or
exacting in that position. In fact, he has
never performed any newspaper work of
any description worth mentioning, but ne
was an excellent advertisement for the
World-Herald, the management of wtich
pay him a salary for the use of his name,
and he has been used to boom the weekly
edition of that publication.
In religion Mr. Bryan is a Presbyterian,
but he remarked once that he had never
read the confession of faith, and although
he did not know much about the religion '
he was born in that faith, and would stay
in it.
Mr. Bryan belongs to the anti-Cleveland
faction of the Nebraska Democracy, and
his elections to Congress have been se
cured through combinations with Popu
lists. It was the Cleveland wing of the
Nebraska Democracy that was responsible
for Mr. Bryan's iact of desire for a third
term in Congress, and even before the
committee on credentials of the present
Democratic National Convention the regu
lar Nebraska delegation was anti-Bryan,
but it was in favor of gold, and tbe free
silver committee turned it down and gave
tbe Nebraska seats to the contesting dele
gation led by the man whose flow of lan
guage subsequently created a tidal wave
which engulfed his op; onents in the con
vention, and on tbe top of which he rode
into a candidacy that will make his name
known in history as the young man who
represented the dying Democracy when it
received its deathblow in November, 1896,
at the hands of the triumphant champion
of protectionâ William McKinley of Ohio.
Mr. Bryan married, in 1884, Miss Mary
Â£. Baird, the daughter of a merchant of
Perry, 111. She was a student in the an
nex of Illinois College while Bryan studied
in the college. They graduated simul
taneously, being valedictorians of their re
spective classes. Sbe studied law and was
admitted to the bar in Nebraska. She is a
writer of much ability and president of the
Lincoln Sorosis. They have three chil
dren â Ruth 11, William 6, and Grace 5.
In a recent interesting sketch of W. J.
Bryan, Champ Clark, the Missouri orator
and statesman, after drawing a compar
ison between Samuel J. Randall and Mr.
Bryan, thus describes the latter:
'In four years' service Bryan estab
lished a far greater reputation than did
Randall in the same length of time. In
deed, it may be said without any extrav
agance that when Bryan quit Congress he
had as widespread fame as Randall had
when hedied after twenty years of Con
cress. Whether the Nebraskan plowed
hie ideas as deep into the minds of men as
did the Pennsylvanian is an entirely dif
ferent question; for as late as 1694 the
line of cleavage made by Randall in the
Democratic party on the tariff was easily
discernible to the naked eye, when seven
teen of his disciples bolted th- Wilson bill,
and several others had the will to bolt, but
lacked the courage.
"Bryan is a collegiate scholar, and has
stowed away la his capacious cranium
much of the golden grain of wisdom and
little of tbe husks, and it is all there for
use, either as argument or embellishment.
Some men are so ugly and ungainly that
it is a positive advantage to them as pub
lic speakers. Some are so handsome and
graceful that they are on good terms with
the audience before they open their lips.
Of the latter class Bryan is a shining ex
ample. His appearance is a passport to
the affections of his fellow men which all
can read. He is the picture of health,
mental, moral an*! physical. He stands 5
feet 10, weighs about 170, is a pronounced
brunette, has a massive head, a clean
shaven face, an aquiline nose, large under
jaw, square ciin. a broad chest, large us
trous dark eyes, a mouth extending almost
from ear to ear, teeth white as pearls and
hair â what there is left of it â black as
midnieht. Beneath his eyes is the pro
tuberant flesh which physiognomists tell
us is indicative of fluency of language and
which was on- of the most striking
features in the face of James G. Blame.
"Bryan neglects none of the accessories
of oratory. Nature richly endowed him
with rare grace. He i- happy mattitr.de
and pose. His gestures are on Hogarth's
line of beauty. Mellifluous is the one
word that most aptly describes his voice.
It is strong enough to be heard by thou
" sands. It is sweet enough to charm those
the least inclined to music. It is so modu
lated as not to vex the ear with monotony
and can be stern and pathetic, tierce or
gentle, serious or humorous, with the
varying emotions of its master. In his
youth "Bryan must have had a skillful
teacher in elocution and must have been a
docile pupil. He adorns his speeches with
illustrations from the classics or from the
common occurrences of everyday life with
equal felicity and facility. Some passages
from his orations are gems and are being
used as declamations by boys at schoolâ
the ultimate tribute to American elo
quence.
"But bis crowning gift as an orator is
his evident sincerity. He is candor incar
nate, and thoroughly believing what be
says himself it is no marvel that he makes
others believe.
"Bryan's first speech in the House â the
one on the tariff in 1892â fixed his status
as one of tbe great orators of tnis genera
tion. It astonished old stagers, electrified
the country and stimulated the ambition
of every younc man in the land. Envious
carpers lugubriously predicted that he
could never duplicate tbat far- resounding
performance; that he would be lifce a
wasp, biggest when first batched, and that
bis Congressional song would be pitched
in diminuendo instead of crescendo. But
he utterly confounded these jealous Cas
sandras by delivering a speech on silver
which must forever remain as a classic in
Congressional literature.
"If it did not increase his fame as much
as did his initial effort, it was for tbe all
sufficient reason tbat there was not so
much room for him to grow in. If Daniel
Webster himself could have come back to
life he could not by twenty years of cease
less endeavor increase his fame as an ora
tor; for while here before he butted his
lofty head against tbe stars. But Bryan
went on to the end, making speeches
stronger and ever stronger, manifesting
new powers every time he arose. Perhaps
his later addresses lacked something in
effervescence, brilliancy and piquancy,
but they grew constantly more logical if
less rhetorical."
The following extracts from some of Mr.
Bryan's speeches in Congress have been
much quoted by Democratic campaign
orator?, and did much to establish his
fame as one of the leading exponents of
tbe income tax and free silver theory:
"They call that man a statesman whose
ear is turned to catch tno slightest pulsa
tions of a pocket-book, and denounce as a
demagogue any one who dares to listen to
the heart-beat of humanity."
â¦ â¢ â¢
"The poor man who takes property by
force is called a thief, hut the creditor who
lean by legislation make a debtor pay a
dollar twice as large as be borrowed is
lauded as the friend of a sound currency.
The man who wants the people to destroy
the Government is an anarchist, but the
man who wants the Government to de
stroy the people is a patriot."
â¦ * â¢
"Some, who are ready to use the power
of the Government to limit the supply of
money, in order to prevent injustice to
the creditor, are slow to admit the right
of the Government to increase the cur
rency when necessary to prevent injustice
to the debtor. I denounce that cruel in
terpretation of governmental power which
would grant the authority to starve, but
would withhold the authority to feed our
people â which would permit a contraction
of our currency, even to the destruction of
all prosperity/but would prohibit the ex
pansion of our currency to keep pace with
the growing needs of a growing Nation!"

"The gentlemen who are so fearful of
socialists when the poor are exempted
from an income tax view with indifference
those methods of taxation which give the
rich a substantial exemption. They weep
more because $15,000,000 is to be collected
from the incomes of tbe rich than they do
at the collection of $300,000,000 upon the
toods which the poor consum-. And
when an attempt is made to equalize these
burdens, not fully, but partially only, the
people of the South and West are calied
anarchists.
"I deny the accusation, sirs. It is
among the people of the South and West,
on the prairies and in the mountains, tbat
you find the stanchest supporters of gov
ernment and tne best friends of law and
order.
"You may not find among these people
the great fortunes which are accumulated
in cities, nor will vor nnd the dark shad
ows which these fortunes throw over the
community, but you will find those will

wliite they demand that property shall
bear its share of taxation. You may not
find among them as much of wealth, but
you will find men who are not only willing
to pay their taxes to support the Govern
ment, but are willing whenever necessary
to offer up their lives m its defense.

TWO WOMEN'S AMBITIONS.
Mrs. Bryan's Exultation and Mrs.
Russell's Chagrin Over the
Convention's Action.
"The Call's" Headquarters, )
Great North een Hotel, y
Chicago, 111., 1 July 10.)
One of the remarkable leal ores of
this remarkable convention ' were : the
actions of two notable ladies.;; ; Seated
' with ; ; the;: â¢: Massachusetts delegation,
iln the front ; row next to the
i grand stand, just after the marvelous
speech of ' W. J. : Bryan, the boy orator of
the Platte, was a lady whose eyes ever and
anon tilled with , tears. . Her face flashed
and she bit her lips vexatiously. Beside
her sat that other > boy orator : of ; the con
vention, ex-Governor Rinsel), and the ;â¢ in
formation' vri.B soon conveyed to the spec
i tators ranged in front that the lady was
none other than Mrs. Russell. -
In a moment many curious, eyes were
gazing; at her, 'but there was from all a
delicate ; recognition of her position, and
these eyes were soon. withdrawn.
The row of Massachusetts delegates sat
,r. A, FHANCIBCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1896.
stolidly -surprised, bat with an air of
resignation. The lady continued to
glance furtively toward the stand. "When
George Fred Williams, tbe live silver man
of the Massachusetts delegation, took a
seat near her she scarcely noticed him. It
is said that Williams is looked upon as a
traitor by the Massachusetts people.
Their general treatment of him indicated
this. Doubtless, Mrs. Russell anticipated
that her husband, the widely advertised
boy orator of Massachusetts, might be
nominated for the Presidency. Instead of
that, the convention placed the wreath on
the brow of the orator of the West. Is it
any wonder she was vexed, and that her
vexation was in evidence? All the hopes
of years were dashed to earth, and her
hubby all but without a party.
On the stage to the right of Senator
White there sat with three or four friends
another lady whose race was livid wiui
expectancy and bright with happiness.
Like Mrs. Russell her hair is dark, almost
black. She is of somewhat slighter build
and her eyes are dark, while her features
are regular and her face in every way
pleasant. She chatted gaily and smiled.
Mrs. Bryan is her name. She is tha wife
of the man about whom everybody was
talking because of bis famous speech.
Life appeared to her brighter than to the
lady of the Bay State and her great happi
ness well showed it. Later when her
husband was nominated and when every
body went wild with the joy of it Mrs.
Bryan sat in nearly the tame place ana
expressed her gratitude to her friends.
She was composed in a way, but her voice
trembled. C. M. Cob.
TELLER IS NONCOMMITTAL
Not Disposed to Say Much Until
After the Conference of the

PUEBLO . Colo., July 10.â Senator Tel
ler stated to-night to a representative of
The United Pre^s his views regarding ex-
Representative Bryan in the following in
terview:
"What do you think of Bryan's nomin
ation?"
"I consider the nomination an excep
tionally strong one. Bryan is an able man
of high character, a strong friend of silver
and close to the people. He will make an
excellent President."
"Do you think he can secure the support
of the siiver men who left the St. Louis
convention?"
"The men who left the St. Louis con
vention will make the silver question par
amount to all others. It is not a question
of politics with them, but of principle. I
am not at liberty to speak for them at this
time, ns I bave received peveral telegrams
concerning a conference to be held within
a day or two and asking me to withhold
any expression of their views until after
such conference."
"I believe you have said that if a siiver
man was nominated at Chicago all the
friends of silver should act together in his
support."
"Yes, I said we must for this campaign
at least overlook all minor differences and
put the country on a sound financial sys
tem that recognizes gold and slyer as the
money of the constitution. To that end
all the energies of silver men should be
bent. lam still of that opinion and hope
to see tbat done, and if it is I leel confi
dent of success."

officially to-day by General Secretary Baer.
To say that the Californians here in at
tsndance are happy woaid be stating the
case mildly. In speaking of the matter,
Rolia V. Watt, chairman of the delegation,
who had labored so faithfully in the
cause, said that 50.000 Endeavorers should
be cared for, if necessary. He believes the
trip across the continent will be an educa
tion to every Endeavorer, and wants all to
come and promises a hearty welcome.
"Not only will the Golden Gate be
opened to welcome you, but the gates of
our hearts and our homes," he said earn
estly in conclusion.
In honor of tbe selection of San Fran
cisco, the bad fs of the Golden State are in
demand, and the favorite song of the Cali
fornians. "Sunshine in the Soul," is heard
on every hand. The sin, ing has become
one of the marked characteristics of the
convention.
Tbe delegates are beginning to sing in
the streets and in the cars as they go from
point to point in their sight-seeing. Their
example is contagions, and Washington
ians are already beginning to learn the
refrains of such songs as "Scatter Sun
shine" and the "Light is Come."
The visitors have been officially esti
mated at 32.000. and the total registration
of the convention is about 42,000. There
are not quite as many here as were ex
pected, but enough to make a great gather
ing, rilled withenthusiaom, philosophic
over the damp weather and firm in the be
lief that the United Society of Christian
Endeavor is the greatest organization in
the world, a beliet ihat is share-i by many
of the people of the Capitol City.
Among those who delivered addresses
at Tent Endeavor this evening was Qiies
Kellogg of San Diego.

Chicago, 111., July 10.)
White-faced and sullen, her bosom heav
ing with indignation, her eyes flashing
with anger and clutching in her tightly
closed hand the seventy-two votes tbat she
refused to give to the National Democracy
New York State sat silent to-day among
her jubilant sisters.
Her dignity had been outraged and in
suit had been added to injury. While the
big hall was a tumultuous mass of men
and women, standing on their chairs in
the midst of a fluttering of handkerchiefs
and waving of flags, New York sat in the
center and d;d not once clap her bands or
raise her voice. Senator Hill, her great
; sachem , wore his white mask and smiled
| at the yelling mob. He and bis colleagues
j kept their seats, so that there appeared to
I be a crater in the center of the hall. It
i was the volcanic crater of discord smolder-
I ing with rancorous fire.
New York's Democracy and her delega
tion were insulted yesterday, first by that
poiitical blackguard, Tillman, he of the
evil eye, and later by Will'am J. Bryan,
the Populistically popular young orator of
Nebraska, and all tbe time by the jeers
and taunts of the majority, simply because
the New York delegates remained true to
their convictions and their pledges.
To-day, when that delegation announced
that it declined to vote for any candidate
who would stand upon a silver platform,
the two-thirds majority hooted, hissed
and jeered. Some silver men shouted
that New York's seventy-two representa
tives should be expelled from the floor of
the convention.
David Bennett Hill smiled a smile that
concealed a dagger. It was a smile of de
fiance, a threat more ominous than a
drawn revolver. There was more phos
phorescence than usual in his light-blue
eyes ana a boldness tbat challenged to
combat. Other members of the delega
tion gritted their teeth and muttered dur
ing that rain of hisses, that snowstorm of
denunciation, that whirlwind of hate.
When the second ballot came round and
the name of New York was called all eyes
turned that way and a stillness fell over
tbe scene. New York closed her lips and
would not answer.
There was a moment's pause, and the
chairman gazed steadily at the group in
the center seats. Then realizing that the
delegation bad determined to repay insult
with contemptuous silence, the chair
passed on to tbe next State, and the storm
of hisses burst forth.
The majority in the State of Wisconsin
â  and other States with gold delegations
; announced that they declined to vote, but
New York slapped the silver convention
in the face with the hand of dumb con
tempt. The convention felt the blow and
smarted under it, and smarted the more
because of that wicked, cruel glittering
smile with which the slap had been ac
companied, and four times the thing
which had been slapped hissed its hate
| like an angry snake.
Next to Senator Hill, General Bragg of
â  Wisconsin was a target for the scorn of
I the silver majority. A courtly gentleman
â¢ he is, his hair touched lightly with the
snows of many years. He responded for
! tbe State of Wisconsin by announcing
I that the majority of tbat delegation de
; clined to vote, for a reason similar to that
j advanced by New York. He was hissed
and greeted with coyote ye!ps and owlish
: hootings. The minority of the delegation,
being siiver men, were allowed to cast
their votes, for all is fair in love, war and
politics.
Every majority or minority of a delega
tion that declined to vote was insulted.
The rabid silverites bissed even their own
friends. Tuus, when Colorado voted for
her favorite son, Henry M. Teller, the
Colorado Republican was hissed so noisily
and persistently that a delegate who liad
red blood in his veins arose and declared
that it was not rood Democracy to hoot at
the name of any person voted for in that
convention. He also was subjected to tbe
indignity of the execration of a mob,
drunken with power and spurred on by tbe
demagogy of a Tillman and a Altgeld.
The sound-money minority did not bolt.
Its members made a passive resistance,
and sat with folded hands while tbe thing
which they had declared would be the
disruption and ruin of the Democratic
party was being done. They did not bolt by
walking bodiyout of the hall.but they wrre
jus; as much out of tbe hall and out of the
convention while sitting in the midst of
the others as though a thousand miles
away.
The votes which they would not give as
delegates they will not give as individuals.
The voices which they would not raise in
tbe convention on behalf of the ticket are
the Â«ame voices which they will not lift
on the stump for the Democracy in the
coming campaign. Let it go down in
history that they did not bolt. Let it be
recorded that tney rejected and denounced
the platform, but that they did not com
mit the unpardonable political sin of bolt-
ing.
Tbere were several picturesque scenes in
the hall to-day. The thunder-storm of
enthusiasm which broke forth when the
announcement was made that th* young
and shallow stump-speaker from Nebraska
had received 280 votes was one of them.
It was a rnignty roar of yells and shouts
and cheers from the throats of 10,000
wildly excited men and women.
The iuterior of the hall became at once a
sea, whose waves were fans, hats, parasols,
banners, nags and handkerchiefs, and in
the midst of this sea, rising from above
the wa*ves, stood two fair girls, oneof 18and
the other of 16 years, attired in simple
costumes of pink, with inflated sleeves
and collars of white lace about their necks
and shoulders. Tneir heads were bare,
showing light brown hair, which the
light from tne windows kissed with gold.
The elder gently waved a large American
flag to and fro. The younger had a smaller
flag and lean' d close against tbe shoulder
of her who looked like her sister. The
pose was most artistic, and its graceful
curves were enhanced by the tumultuous
background. It was the result of long
practice, copied from some good painting
and imitated under the watchful eye of a
Delsartean professor.
The split Democracy may be congratu
lated on both sides on the fact that Boss
Altgeld of Illinois and his political pal.
Governor Stone of Missouri, were
placed to rest where ?row the
daisies of defeat. Bland was their
man, and they lost him. Some of Mr.
Bland's friends are very sore because of
the recognition of the A. P. A. by the con
vention. Members of this organization
scattered pamphlets among the delega
tions to the effect that if a confessional
was wanted in the White House they
should vote for Bland. His friends say
that he is a Methodists, but that the A. P.
A. does not like him because some of his
relatives, whose souls are not in bis keep
ing, are Roman Catholics. There can be
no doubt that it was an A. P. A. under
current that swept Silver Dick off his feet.
The best speech with the poorest deliv
ery was that made yesterday by Senator
Vest when presenting Mr. Bland's name
before the convention. The poorest speech
with tne best delivery was that of Bryan
of Nebraska yesterday on the silver ques
tion. Yet it gave him the nomination for
the Presidency. There was no reasoning
in it. There was no argument in it. It
was an exulting over a prostrate enemy
and a cheap defiance directed against a
crippled foemen. A few pretty and not
original sentences, such as that one about
the crown of thorns on the laborer, who
has to carry a cross of gold, and that about
destroying the cities and their rebuilding
by the farmers, caught the ear and the
heart of the convention, and because their
eyes were pleased with his fine presence
and their ears tickled with cheaply gilded
words they bestowed upon him the doubt
ful honor of being stood up to be knocked
down and out by Mr. McKinley of Ohio.
The partiality of the A. P. A. delegates
for Mr. Bryan was n<jt unnoticed by the
friends of Mr. Bland and some of them
are saying that there may be good reason
to suspect that the boy Populist socialistic
orator from Nebraska, who now captains
the sinking ship of Democracy, is a mem
ber of tbe American Protective Associa
tion and tbat he will receive the hearty in
dorsement of that organization.
The Democracy has wisely chosen for
its candidate for the Presidency an elo
cutionist. In its tee-bee age of maiden
hood it has allowed its old and much-worn
affections to be won by the elitter of
cheaply gilded words and the tinsel of
high-school sentences, so that when the
dear old thing shall die it will have some
one left to shed a dramatic tear over its
grave and to utter some beautiful though
not original thinklets.
'Tib a consolation lo be assured of a sen
timental funeral oration, but the difficulty
is the more than likelihood that the chap
lain and the deceased will be buried to
gether and that the words cf consolation
to the living will be uttered by a gentle
man from Canton, Ohio, who was not
nominated on Friday.
I have bad several looks and several
listens at the prominently unfortunate
Mr. Bryan during the past week. He is
not like his pictures, which represent him
with a fat, short head. He is above the
medium height, just nice looking enough
and tall enough to be a popular actor.
Like Major McKinley, he is a brunette. If
his shapely nose did not fall short he
would have a classical face.
His lips are thin, closely set and drawn
down at the corners, and his smooth
shaven face gives him the appearance of a
juvenile tragedian. He has a beautiful
voice, clear and mellow, with no trace of
falsetto or shrillness. It is what I would
call a barytone, without the usual vibrato.
When I said that Mr. Bryan was an elo
cutionist, I described tbe man's mentality.
He is a showy, shallow man, with words
as bis stock in trade and owes his nomina
tion to his elocution. His speeches fall
very flatly on the reader when they are
dive>ted of the stage costume of gesture
and accent. John Paul Cosgravb.

Bryan's personal assurance, it is stated
thav he is not an A. P. A. He is a Preaby

of the Modern Woodmen of America.

(. hicago, 111., July 10. )
The great fierbt is over and the promi
nent hero of the occasion has been nomi
nated for President. He came as a con
testant for a seat in the convention to fight
for the adoption of a silver platform and
the nomination of a silver candidate. His
success in the matter of tbe platform was
signal and he should certainly be satisfied
with the candidate. His nomination has
started a wave of popular enthusiasm here,
which bids fair to grow.
I was present at a large single-tax meat
ing this evening, which was attended by
Democrats, Republicans and Populists.
The mention of Bryan's nomination was
greeted with general and repeated ap
plause.
The California delegation voted solidly
for Bryan on the fifth ballot, and he waa
the choice of a majority of the delegation
from tne beginning. On the first four bal
lots members of the delegation cast com
plimentary votes for other candidates, but
the first, the real break in favor of "the
boy orator of the Platte," came from Cali
fornia.
The convention was finally stampeded
by the delegations from Alabama, Cali
fornia, Colorado and by the announce
ment during the fifth ballot that the Illi
nois delegation, which had previously cast
43 votes for Bland, wished to retire for
consultation before voting. It was well
understood that Bryan was the second
choice of the delegation, and the an
nouncement of its motion for consultation
was practically a notice to the convention
that it would change its vote from Bland
to the Nebraskan. This knowledge created
great excitement on the floor and caused
many of the delegations to go to Bryan ns
the probable winner before the vote of
Illinois was announced.
At this point, when his nomination
seemed assured, the standards of twenty
two States were wrenched from their
places by excited men, carried to the cen
ter of the convention section and waved
aloft for fifteen minutes. Then a pro
cession of the standard-bearers formed,
and, amid the shouts and cheers of del
egates and applause of 20,000 visitors,
marched repeatedly around the hall.
When this gr^at outburst subsided the
names of Bland. Boies, Matthews and
McLean were withdrawn and the votes
thai had been given to them were trans
ferred to Bryan, giving him a clear two
thirds majority.
Senator Turpie of Indiana moved to
make the nomination unanimous. When
the motion was put a great affirmative
shout went up tbat must nave shaken the
rafters ol the amphitheater. The noes
being called for New York and the other
dissenting delegations remained silent.
The nomination was declared unanimous
and then for tbe first time in tbe history
of this remarkable and memorable con
vention the silver men of tbe West ap
plauded the golden silence of the men of
the East.
The nomination of a candidate for Vice-
President has been postponed until to
morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
It is believed the se-sion will be short
and that the nomination will be given to a
representative of the Middle West, either
Ohio, Indiana or Illinois. My personal
preference is Adlai Stevenson, but a ma
jority of the delegation favors either Mat
thews of Indiana or McLean of Ohio.
The delegation held a very pleasant final
meeting this afternoon and agreed that,
notwithstanding the friction naturally at
tending attempts to harmonize differences
of opinions in the heat of such contests as
we bave bad in this convention, all of the
members of the delegation are jolly
good fellows and have conscientiously dis
charged their duties.

McMINNVILLE. Or., July 10,-The first
annual convention of the newly formed
Oregon partyâ the Union Bimetaliistsâ
vraa held yesterday. Over 300 delegates
were present, representing eleven counties

and free-silver Republicans, Populists',
Democrats and Independents participated'
in the convention and united in forming
the platform.
Besides the work of extending the plat
form as reported, the convention elected
| seventeen delegates to the St. Loais con
vention, all of whom are Populists and
- Republicans, exceptinu one Democrat.
D. P. Thompson of Portland was made

ESADE WITH GERMANY.
It May Be Stimulated by Sending bales

NEW YORK, N. V., July 10.â William
D. Warner, the United States Consul at
Cologne, has written the State Depart
ment that lie has many inquiries from
American exporters as to European trade.
He says all complain of a lack of results.
Mr. Warner says this is due principally
to the fact that American business men
rely almost entirely upon circulars. They
plaster Germany witn printed matter, all
of which is ignored. The only way to en
gage in trade is by direct negotiations by
personal work. He advises the sending to
Germany of eood agents, intelligent men
acquainted with both the English and
German languages. He warns Americans
also not to stop with the establishment of
relations with German agents at the sea
ports, but to send men into tbe interior
and sell direct to merchants of the inland
cities and towns.

About four hours after the red sun had
sunk out of sight behind the great hills
and the golden halo that spreads fan-like
up from the horizon had changed into
night, Private Willie Long, having tired
of wandering, came back into camp last
night. It was then too iate for his mock
execution at tne cannon's mouth, as
ordered by the court-martial, for having
accidentally stabbed Cook Al Mattison in
the forehead with a saber; and besides,
the festivities of the evening were at their
height. Attractive as executing a man
may be to the cadet, the charms of a cool
and social evening with the Indies on a
dancing platform are greater, and Willie
tvas allowed to turn in and sleep peace
fully until this mornine's reveille.
The farce of the execution of Long was
carried out to-ni.ht. A large crowd of
spectators from the ranches and small
towns was present. Lone bore up bravely
and asked for something extra for supper.
He ate oyster soup, kindly prepared by
Al Mattison, the cook, for the alleged at
tempted murder of whom he was found
guilty by the court-martial, and sentenced
to death before the cannon mouth.
The prisoner was attired in white trous
ers, white shirt and white hat. His hands
were tied behind his back with a white
handkerchief. He was then placed in the
center of a squad of cadets, under com
mand of Captain Drady, and all took their
position on the dancing platform.
A drum corps with muffled drums stood
at one side. When all was in readiness a
dirge was played on the organ. Dr. A. P.
Mulligan joined in with a violin accompa
niment, and the solemn march to the exe
cution ground was begun.
The squad marched first round the plat
form and tben proceeded down the main
avenue of the tents to the field, the pris
oner being in the center, cooliy smoking a
cigar which had been presented to him by
Rev. Father Yorke. The hospital corps,
bearing a white stretcher to carry the body,
brought up the rear.
At tbe lower end of the avenue the
frowning mouth of a cannon about eight
inches iong couJd be seen by those who
had spyglasses. Others were told where
it was.
Prisoner William Long was tola to step
from the ranks. He stepped forward as
brave as a Spartan and with a defiant air.
Death bad no terrors for him, his whole
bearing evidenced.
The prisoner was led over to a long box,
on which he seated himself, and he was
then blindfolded. The box was supposed
to do duty as a coffin. He sat facing the
cannon. A hush fell on the spectators.
The people looked on with bated breath.
At that critical moment Rev. Father
A Scene Under the Big Trees at Camp Montgomery.
O'Ryan stepped forward and protested
against the execution as invalid, claiming
it should have taken place last night at
the time set for it by the court-martial.
Tbe objection was overruled. A voice in
the crowd suddenly shouted, "Advance,
vanguards!"
A rescuing party of cadets with drawn
6abers rushed forward through the crowd.
â¢Draw," shouted the captain of the regu
lars, and the next instant tbe rescuers and
tbe regulars were engaged in mortal com
bat. Sabers clashed in the air and there
were hoarse and desperate shouts.
The prisoner was in the center. He was
blindfolded, dragged hither and thither
while the troops fought nocly on. Finally
the rescuing party was vanquished, and
the prisoner" with his beautiful white fu
neral garments soiled by the straggle in
the attempted rescue, was replaced on the
box and again olindfolded.
"Are you ready?" asked the captain.
"Yes, sir," from the soldier at the
cannon.
"Fire!"
There was a flash of flame, a thunderous
report which echoed along the valley, and
Willie Long was no more. He fell over on
the box with his face to the sky as natur
ally as though it were a real execution.
t)r. Mulligan, the camp physician,
stepped forward, felt his pulse and offi
cially pronounced him dead. Then a roll
of drums was heard and the late Willies
comrades of the League of the Cross
Cadets began to moan out their grief and
to apply their handkerchiefs.
T;.e hospital corps stepped forward, the
body was placed on the stretcher, and,
with beating drums and a sorrowful pro
cession, the march back to the platform
under the spreading oak tree was begun
in the deepening twilight. Once on the
way back the body was spilled out of tbe
stretcher.
There the friends of the late Willie passed
in review before the remains to catch a
'ast glimpse of his white blindfolded face
before he was allowed to return to life.

LOS ANGELES SUICIDE
'â ::â â â ;. â â¢, I
Uarmaduke P. Hi/and Drowns Himself in
Echo Lakeâ A Slave to , %
Liquor.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 19.â 1n the
waters of Echo Lake Marmaduke P.
Hiland sought : surcease from the evils of
an uncontrollable appetite for liquor this
morning. After he had taken the first
leap, the suicide, appalled at the coming
of death,' cried out and attempted to regain
the shore. Before assistance could reach
him he had gone down for the last time,
and the would-be rescuers towed a corpse
to the shore.
On the bank was Hiland's coat, hat and
cane. With them was found the following
note, addressed to bis wife, written on the
back of a large yellow envelope:
Dear Anna: I expected this would end it,
but I could not help it. All I have is yours.
Kiss baby for me. Oh, how I love her.
The suicide was a son-in-law of John
Charter, a wealthy resident of this city.
He was 34 years of age. His act widows
an excellent woman and leaves four beau
tiful children, the. eldest 16 and the young
est 2 years of age, without a father. Hi
land and Miss Charter were married when
quite young, and for many yeais they re
sided at Duarte.
About three years ago the husband took
to liquor, which set his wife's parents
against him. He was finally induced to
take the Keeley cure, and for eight
months he lived uprightly. He then
moved into Los Angeles and took a
special agency for several insurance com
panics. Everything went well for some
time, when in an unguarded moment he
yielded to the old tempter.
Drink caused him to lose his position.
He became despondent and resolved to
put an end to his existence, believing that
if he was out of the way his father-in-law
would look after his widow and children.
The body was brought to an under
taker's, where an inquest was held, a ver
dict of drowning with suicidal intent
being rendered.
When Coroner Campbell brought the
grii-stricken widow into the room where
the body lay the poor woman threw her
arms about the silent form, and with
streaming eyes showered kisses upon the
lips. Appealing to the dead she exclaimed
again and again :
"Oh, my darling husband, why did you
not wait for me."

LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 10.â The
orange-growers of Southern California met
in special session in the Chamber of Com-

cuss the outlook of the citrus fruit crop
and to form a permanent organization,
that the growers may with co-operation
obtain the best results in the growing and
marketing of their citrus fruits. W. H.
Young of Duarte was made chairman and
H. E. Cheesbora of Covina secretary.
President Young announced the object

GUARDS REVIEWED
AT CAMP BUDD.
The Governor Visits the
Quarters of the First
Infantry.
PRAISES THE TROOPS.
Pleased With the Precision and
Military Grace of Their
Evolutions.
BLTJECOATS ATTEND A DANCE.
The Elite of Stockton Assembles at
Agricultural Pavi ion to Greet
Its Guests.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 10.â Governor
Budd and staff accepted the invitation of
Major Tilden of the First Infantry, N. G.
' C, to attend a review this evening in honor
of bimseif and staff at Camp Budd. By
the noon train from Sacramento the Gov
ernor and Assistant Adjutant-General
Peeler arrived and on the afternoon train
from San Francisco came Colonels Chad
bourne, Fisher and Vail and Captain Car
rington of the regular army. Colonel
Sperry of this city, also of the Governor's
staff, assisted in the review, in which com
panies A and B of the Sixth Regiment
also participated.
A lar^re crowd journeyed to the camp to
witness the maneuvers. Tbe men executed
the evolutions with clock-like precision
and acquitted themselves creditably. The
Governor was highly pleased with the
work of the guardsmen and said so. He
is deeply interested in the work of the
National Guard and is ready to do any
thing be can for the benefit of the service.
To-night the camp was, in a measure,
deserted. The officers and men left their
tents to attend the ball given in honor of
the visiting guardsmen by the officers of
companies A and B, Sixth Regiment, sta
tioned at Stockton. The big hall of the
Agricultural Pavilion was engaged, and
a merry throng danced to the music sup
plied by the Sixth Regiment band. The
swagger set of the city was in attendance.
The visiting guardsmen will remain
here two days longer, when they will
break camp and return homeward. They
have had a jolly time in Stockton, but the
intense heat of tbe past four days has
somewhat marred the pleasure. They
have made up for lost time in the cool
evenings, and many a iolly party of blue
coats has been landed in the guardhouse
for being out after Hours.
LIFE AT CAMP WALKER.
Soldiers of the Boy' Brigade Enjoy
Their Outing at Guerneville.
GTJERNEVILLE, Cal,, July 10.â In
their cool retreat under the shade of the
redwoods at Camp Walker in the old Bo
hemian grove the Second Regiment of the
Boys' Brigade is enjoying life. With
roaming through the forest or Bwimming
in the river after guard mount the youns
sters are making the most of their sum
mer outing.
However pleasant the days are the nights
are quite cold, and a two-hour picket-post
is not as pleasant and restful as the same
period spent in the tent-bed. Conse
quently the small warriors "kick" like
old soldiers when their guard detail comes
around. Besides, the sentry beats are out
side of the camp, and the small sentry
must walk close to the dark, thick brush
that surrounds the clearing. In these
gloomy shadows countless savage foes may
be lurking, such as coyotes, wildcats,
mink and weasles. Even the night owl'
whose dreadful hooting be hears in the
treetops above him, has a voice that terri
fies. He does not know that the grim
bird is only protesting against this war
like invasion of his "ancient, solitary
reign." Nor does he know tnat much of
the coyote yelps and mink squeaks which
he hears are frightfully poor imitations
coming from the mouths of bis comrades
who are generously sacrificing their sleep
in their tents that he may not get lonesome
on his post.
Colonel Walker, the commander of the
regiment, has not yet arrived nor has
General J. H. Russell, the brigade com
mander. Yesterday Major A. W. Taylor,
who had been on the sick list, relieved
Captain B. L. Weymouth, who had been
in command of the camp. Captain Wev
mouth is the regimental paymaster and
doubtless it is owing to bis efforts that the
mess contains such good fare. A sutler's
store in the camp sells at reasonable rates
whatever in the way of eatables or drink
ables the juvenile troopers may desire.
Tfre religious services are conducted by
Rev. Mr. Scudder of the First Congrega
tional Church of Alameda, and also by
Major Taylor. Under the grand old trees,
with tbe congregation of young soldiers
sitting on fallen logs, no divine service
could be more impressive. It recalls the
line: "The groves were God's first
temples."
The Woman's Auxiliary Corps is under
tbe command of Mrs. Jeannette Jones of
Alameda. Their tents occupy one-half of
the camp in a pleasant locality near the
river. Captain McNeil!, who is a strict
disciplinarian, advocated giving the
younger portion of tbe auxiliaries post
duty in some part of the camp. The corps
protested, .stating that as mothers and
teac'iers in the Sabbath schools they were
always on guard. The ladies, however,
detailed themselves to make a blackberry
raid in the woods. They promised upon
their return to become cooks, and bake
enough blackberry pie to last tne entire
regimen' luring the oamp. They knew
right wbere the berries were and how large
they were, and one young auxiliary said
she had seen them crowing in her dreams.
So they sallied forth, escorted out of th c
camp by the officers of the guard, and,
guided by the dreamer, plunged irtto the
forest. About sundown they came back
rejoicing, bearing their plunder â a dozen
and a half poor, little, miserable, blighted
berries that a jaybird would scorn to
notice.
Paymaster Weymouth continues to pro
vide the pies.
The camp will close next Tuesday.
BAKERSFIELD CRACKSMEN.
Unsuccessful Attempt to Gain Entrance
to the County Treasurer's
Vaults.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal, July 10.â When
the janitor opened the Court-house this
morning he found that burglars i ad en
tered the building during the night and
made an unsuccessful attempt to force an
entrance to the vault in the County Trea
surer's office. The burglars got in through
a window opening off the front porch, the
office being on the ground floor. They
broke off the knob of the door, ana with
an ordinary breast drill bored three holes
into the dial of the combination lock. Iwo
were through the metal, but in the third
the drill broke and was left in the hole.
They also broke a second drill, the pieces
being found on the floor. Many burned
matches were strewn over the floor.
The vault door is old-fashioned, and had
the burglars drilled through as they in
tended, they Tould have been able to
break the lock and force an entrance.
But even had tbev got through the out
side door, they could not have got at the
$12,000 or $13,000 in the vault without cut
ting through another door, and then open
ing a modern burglar-pioof safe in which
coin was kept.
The job was evidently the work of ama
teurs, as the tools with which it was done
were stolen from a blacksmith shop yes
terday.
TRAGEDY AT SACRAMENTO
Joseph Mitchell Murdered by
a Lunatic Known as
Whistling Pete.
The Madman Escapes From His Pur
suers â His Victim's Mother
Becomes a Maniac.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 10.â Joseph
Mitchell, 28 years of age, was shot and
killed this evening by a naif-crazed man
who is known by the cognomen of
"Whistling Pete," at the corner of Twelfth
and P streets. The assassin escaped, with
the entire police force in pursuit.
When last seen he was rushing at a mad
speed through the Capital park, flourishing
his revolver.
Whistling Fete has resided in this city
for years, and made a livelihood by doing
odd jobs of gardening.
He has always been considered barm
less, but could be thrown into a frenzy by
whistling at him as he passed along the
street.
Several young men, including Joe
Mitchell and his brother Ed, were sitting
in front of a grocery-store this evening
and Pete passed them.
Ed Mitchell began whistling and in
stantly drew the attention of the man,
who turned and scolded the crowd. Again
some one whistled and the lunatic
whirled, walked back to the crowd and,
with the words, "I'll stop this whistling,"
drew a revolrer and fired two shots.
As Pete fired the second shot Joe
Mitchell grappled with him in an attempt
to disarm him. The lunatic placed the
muzzle of the pistol against Mitchell's
head and pulled the trigger. The bullet
struck the jawbone ana ranged downward
into the throat and the young man fell to
the Sidewalk a corpse.
Whistling Pete tuen fled up the street.
Ed Mitchell ran into the grocery store and
procured a revolver, intending to pursue
his brother's murderer and kill him, but
he was overpowered and disarmed. The
murderer ran directly by the home of his
victim, whose mother was standing at tbe
gate.
She called to him, and asked him what
the trouble was. but he refused to answer
and kept on running. A moment later
she was informed of the death of her son.
2She ran down to where the body lay
across the sidewalk, and at si^ht of the
corpse became, seemingly, a raving maniac.
After a hard struggle she was overcome
and conveyed to her home, where it took
the united efforts of six men to retain her
on a couch until -the arrival of a physi
cian, who administered morphine until
her struggles ceased.
It is feared that her reason may be per
manently injured.
Â£The affair nas created the greatest ex
citement. It is feared that tbe crazed man
may kill other.* before he can be secured
and disarmed.
Whistling Pete is a tall, sparely built
old man, weighing 145 pounds, with red
hair and short, stubby sideburns ana chin
vhibkers. He is about 50 years of age.

A MURDER AT
FORT MASON
Private Joseph E. Quinn
Has His Throat
Cut.
PRIVATE KELLY JAILED
The Two Men Had Quarreled
At an Early Hour in the
Evening.
KELLY'S RAZOR WAS USED.
When Arrested He Was in Bed, but
His Hands Were Blood
stained.
Joseph E. Qainn, a private in Battary E,
Fifth Artillery, was murdered laat night
at Fort Mason by a companion.
James Kelly, a member of the same com
pany, is under arrest. No cause is known
other than that Quitin and Kelly had a quar
rel early in the evening, which, however,
was supposed by their friends to have
been of no more than passing moment,
and it was thought that the men had re
sumed their former friendly footing.
The killing was of a rather remarkable
character, Quinn's head being almost
severed from his shoulders by a razor cut.
So far as known there was no witness to
the affair, although a private named
Kampsmith, being arrested, laid the crime
at once to Kelly.
The crime was committed at about 11:15,
when the men were responding to the
"call to quarters."
At that time Kelly and Quinn were re
turning from a walk outside the immedi
ate grounds of the fort. They both slept
in the same barracks but in different
rooms.
Something of a struggle was seen In
front of the barracks and the circumstance
was reported to the sergeant of the guard
by Private Mills.
When that officer got to the place he
found Quinn prone upon the ground and
in bis death struggle, his throat cut and
blood pouring from the wound in a stream.
Post Surgeon G. W. Wells called and
the body â for life was extinct â was carried
into the hospital and laid upon the floor.
Captain Vogdes was notified, and he
made a rapid tour of the grounds and bar
racks.
He encountered Private Kampsmith in ,
the grounds and asked him what he was
doing there at that time.
Kampsmith replied that he was there
"on pass."
This being contrary to regulations the
captain ordered Kampsmith under arrest.
In the guardhouse Kampsmith, without
any question being asked, volunteered
the statement that "Kelly did it."
"Leaving him there," said the captain,
last night, "I went to the battery office
and confined Private Mills, who had been
reported to me as having had a row with
Quinn early in the evening.
"The doctor and I then went bacx to the
quarters and woke Private Kelly up. The
doctor examined his hands and found
them stained with bipod.
"I then confined Private Kelly and went
to the place of the murder, and found a
hat belonging to Qainn and a cap belong
ing to Kelly lying on the ground.
"Kelly was reported to nave had a razor
in hi- pocket early in the evening, which
could not now be found.
"The doctor and 1 then searched and
found a razor, which two witnesses testify
as being Kelly's, on the ground about
forty feet from the place of the killing.
"Private Quinn was never able to speaK
after being found."
The parties who identify the razor ns
being Kelly's are Sergeant Smith and
Corporal Collins, the latter having made
Kelly a present of it.
Captain Vodges says there is no doubt
in his mind that on their way to their
quarters Kelly slipped up behind Quinn
and drew the blade across bis throat.
Quinn, the murdered man, bore an ex
cellent reputation. He was a good, steady
soldier, something of an athlete, and was,
therefore, in frequent small but semi-good
natured quarrels.
He was born in Chicago, where he has
relatives. Kelly is somewhat older. He
refuses to talk about the matter.
Being asked how his hands became
bloody, he said he did not know.
Kelly was taken to the City Prison this
morning by Officers Conley and Herring
ton.
The Coroner brought the body to the
Morgue and an inquest will be held this
morning.
When brought to the City Prison Kelly
refused to discuss the murder and
denied any knowledge of it. He said that
ne had been drinking at "Tne Canteen"
during the evening and got full.
He went to his quarters and retired. The
first he knew of any trouble having oc
curred, he declared, was when he was
awakened and told that he had killed a
man.
Kelly is 29 years of age and a native
of Ireland. He has been in the service
two and a half years.

tragedy and Cyrus Barnard, the supposed
murderer, all under ground, it might be
supposed that the sensation which has so
shaken Santa Barbara would subside and
the city fall back into its accustomed
peace, but this is not the case.
Sheriff's deputies have to-day been ply
ing hither and thither. One posse re
turned from the mountains after a two
days' stay, and it is understood that an
other is about to start out. AH this holds
much significance, but Sheriff Hicks keeps
his own counsel, only saying in response
to inquiries that he is not yet ready to dis
close the nature of the work that is being
done.
Out in Montecito a whisper is going
about which is probably wholly baseless,
but suggests the awful possibilities that
attend the liberty allowed a deranged and
irresponsible person.
In a beautiful home about a quarter of a
mile from the Richardson place, and with
only one tiny cottage between, a dement
ed girl belonging to a noted Eastern fam
ily has long been living, surrounded by
every corn for; and attention, having been
brought thither in the hope thai a change
of scene and climate might restore ncr
lost reason.
She has a large corps of trained attend
ants, one of whom volunteered I.er services
tor the benefit of Mrs. Richardson, as she
lay unconscious and near to death. This
young lady has been growing sullen and
violent of late and has frequently escaped
from the custody of her attendants.
She has often made her way to the house
of neighbors, and women in the vicinity
have grown nervous and apprehensive,
having often seen her face pressed against
their windows at nighr. Sne has broken
into houses, and been found seated at sec
retaries and writing letters, an occupation
which seems to be one of her mania-.
At 4 o'clock on Monday morning some
musicians were returning from a Spanish
dance at Montecito, when their horse
shied violently at what appeared to be a
human form lying beside a culvert on the
left side of the road and at a place com
manding a view of Ethel Richardson 'si
lighted window.
This figure had no defined contour, and
in their hasty glimpse of it resembled a
woman's draperies; but they assumed
that it was some drunken man and passed
on.
It is the story of these . musicians, and
the knowledge of, the young woman's
violent whim.?, mat has given rise .to the
horrible rumors connecting 1 her name with
those of murdered Mrs. Richardson .and

to-day caused two residents of Rincon
Valley to believe hat the end of the world
was near. The storm, if su:h it could be
called, waa short but sharp, and consisted
of one big b\&c\ cloud, one terrific peal of
thunder and a bolt of business-like light
ning.
The lightning struck in the county road,
about thirty feet from Richard Weather
ington. who was at work in a hay neid.
He was prostrated by the force of the
shock, and remained insensible for some
time. Mrs. J. Norris, who was driving
by at the time, was about forty yards from
where the bolt struck, and though fully
conscious of/ Mr. Weatherington'.^, plight,
was unable fo go to ftis assistance for some
time. They say the sensation of being
struck by lightning is far from pleas
ant, Mrs. Korris describing it as a
"tingling in her limbs as though her foot
had been asleep," The large jagged hole
in the ground where the bolt struck is an
object of great interest to many sightseers.
In tne year 1596 there were only four
kinds of hyacinth, the single and the
double blue, the purple and the violet. At
the present time there many thousands of
varieties.

FOR PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Otiio
FOR VICF-PRESIDKNTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1898.
Bryan is not so much a dart horse as an
off-colored colt.
The issue of the campaign is to turn
down the fools.
Now then register at once and get ready
for the campaign.
Bryan will get no congratulations signed
Grover Cleveland.
And the lone fisherman of Buzzards
Bayâ what of him?
The people will vote for statesmen and
not for blatherskites.
Conservative Democrats will find room
for them in Republican ranks.
What will it profit Democracy to gain
Nebraska and lose New York?
There are some Democrats left in spots,
but there is no National party of them any
more. . <-
Democracy will have nothing to ratify
but wind, and it ought to be able to unite
on that.
Whitney, Pattison. Russell and Hill will
find a European trip very pleasant this
summer.
The Democratic donkey can say with
truth: "The convention was ruled by my
brothers."
Now then we shall see whether any boy
orator can lead the Populists into a fool
movement.
Charles A. Dana is a Democrat, but he is
no fool, and is not following the party
flock this year.
The Democratic Presidential candidate
is better than his party, inasmuch as his
record is shorter.
Bryan's oratory will go through the
Democratic platform like a windstorm
through a fogbank.
The Democratic ticket makes Republican
victory sure, so get into the procession
and help to whoop it up.
A promise of free silver is but a poor
gilding for such a bitter pill as a free-trade
tariff and ruined industries.
The only thing in New York that
Democracy can claim ia Tammany Hall,
and they are welcome to that.
After the meddling and mudoling of this
administration who can trnst the Demo
( ratio party on any platform?
The country was never more in need of
a strictly business administration, and
Democracy offers it a windbag.
Silver Dick liland and Farmer Boies can
sympathiee with one another in mourning
the ingratitude of Democracies.
The Chicago platform is weak, but it
may be strong enough for the light-weight
ticket that has been placed on it.
We said this woulu be a campaign of
business against flapdoodle, and Bryan's
nomination fulfills the prophecy.
Turning down Cleveland at Chicago this
year shows a repentant spirit for having
elected him, but It doesn't atone for it.
The result may have been due solely to
Bryan's cyclonic oratory, and then, again,
there may have been a dicker with Alt
geld. _
We will be much obliged if the Demo
cratic party will circulate the speeches of
Altgeld and Tillman as campaign docu
ments.
Bryan may possibly carry Nebraska, but
we take notice be did not do it when he
was a candidate for Senator against
Thurston.
The trans-Mississippi section of the
Union has at last a Presidential candidate,
but he is only a little one and won't be in
the count.
There are almost enough conservative
Democrats in this country to elect McKin
ley, and they are declaring for him all
over the Union.
It will be noted that the Chicago plat
form gives nothing but a snub to those who
wish -work and wages and a home market
for home goods.
The deficit party remains true to the de
ficit tariff and gives the country another
proof of its incapacity to learn anything
even from experience.
We can gauge tbe capacity of the Chi
cago convention by the fact that so shal
low a rhetorician as the boy orator of the
riatte could intoxicate it with the ex
uberance of his verbosity and send it reel
ing off its feet.
CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS.
As the campaign progresses it will be
seen that tbe protest uttered in tbe Chi
cago convention by Whituey, Russell,
Hill and Vilas gave expression to a senti
ment which is not confined to a few lead
ing politicians disappointed in their
aspirations for office. It expressed tbe
earnest convictions of conservative Demo
crats all over the country. In San Fran
cisco, as well as in New York and all along
the Pacific Coast, as well as along the At
lantic, that protest is being repeated and
reasserted.
Business men who believed in the prin
ciples of Democracy will not follow blindly
the lead of Altgald, Tillman and Bryan.
They know that a Government by these
men would be disastrous to every interest
and every industry of the people, it
would fill the country with disturbance,
arraying one class of people against an
other, and be productive of evils which,
in the aggregate, would be hardly leg'
disastrous than civil war.
That clear-headed, patriotic Democrats
perceive the danger ahead is beyond ques
tion. We have published in The Call in
terviews with many of them in this City,
and the prevailing sentiment among them
is unmistukable. Tbey will not vote tbe
Democratic ticket so long as the Demo
cratic party is controlled by agitators,
demagogues and men utterly incompetent
either to lead or follow wisely. Tnousands
of men who would gladly have supported
Wnitney or Pattison will Dot support
Bryan. They will not lend their assistance
to men who are trying to raise class issues
and sectional issues in this country. They
are business men and they wish business
to be on a safe basis. They are patriots
and they wish the Republic to be free
from disorders arid dangers. Tbey will
vote this year for McKinley because he
stands for protection that means pros
perity in business, and because he has a
record of patriotism that means a devo
tion to the welfare of the whole people
and the whole Union.
The vruth is Democracy is an utterly
discredited party. It was never so weakly
or so viciously led as no^v. Never did it
have in Congress so many men each aspir
ing to dictatorship and eager to rule or
ruin the Republic. Cleveland could not
control these men. They made his admin
istration a fiasco. They gave the country
a deficit tariff. They forced the President
to borrow money and then denounced
him for doing it. They broke every pledge
made to the people or to one another. They
filled both halls of Congress with bitter
denunciations of er.ch other until their
open, loud and shameless quarrels became
a public scandal. Such leaders will not
find support in America. If there were
not Republicans enough to baffle such
schemes and such Catalines there would
be enough conservative Democrats to do
it. The voice of protest at Chicago rings
through the land like an alarm bell, and
all good citizens will rally to confront the
danger. ______________
WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN.
While standing thereupon the hall plat
form, all ready to declare the eternal ad
journment of the convention and the
everlasting burial of the Democracy,
Chairman White might have looked down
into his party's grave, and said with
Hamlet as tbe Dane stood beside the
grave of Yorick, "To what base uses we
may return!" There were giant minds
in the convention. There were men there
who stand well to the top of America*
long list of great political economists and
master 3of the science of government, but,
like Gulliver, they were tied to a stake by
Lilliputians. But then as Dean Swift says:
So. naturalists observe, a flea
Has smaller fleas that on blm prey;
And these have smaller still to bite 'em;
And so proceed ad lnfltiitmu.
It is hard to understand bow the conven
tion finally settled upon William Jennings
Bryan, the 3G years old Nebraska orator.
If, just before plunging into the abyss
from whose depths of deeper political
damnation the Democratic party will
never return, the convention thought it
would perpetuate a huge joke wherewith
to round out its blundering and perfidious
life, the nomination of a man who sold
out bis party body and sou! for one chance
in a million to draw the epaulets of a
United States Senator is easily explained.
Bryan's nomination is a joke.
Mr. Bryan is not a Democrat, nor is he
a Populist, but he gravitates from one to
the other. He might be called a political
Don Quixote, unattended by a common
seuse, unimaginative Sancho Panza. He
does not mean to be ungrateful, but he
does not think it ingratitude when favors
are bestowed upon him to turn ana rend
the bestower of them, if to 'do otherwise
would binder him in satisfying hii ambi
tion. He coquetted with the Louisiana
delegation, yet he looks upon the payment
of a bounty to the sugar-growers of that
State as something rather worse than
highway robbery.
Two years ago tbe Democracy of Ne
braska conferred upon Mr. Bryan the dis
tinguished honor of "orator" of the State
nominating convention. lie delivered
one of his "tornado" speeches and carried
the majority of the convention into a trap
which he bad previously set, and before
many delegates knew what they were
doing they had indorsed the nominees,
platform and all, of the Populist Conven
tion which had been held a week or two
previous. Tbe price of the sellout was the
support of what was counted upon to be
a Populist Legislature for United States
Senator. He got less than one-fifth of the
vote of tbe Legislature.
His candidacy for member of the Fifty
third Congress was steep uphill work
until a deal was made with certain Popu
lists to throw the vote of that party to Mr.
Bryan. Near the close of the campaign
money was needed to "consummate" cer
tain trades. The Democrats who put up
the required sum were in (he delegation
to the Chicago convention that Mr. Bryan
had declared "irregular," so that himself
ana his followers might be seated. Im
mediately after his defeat for tbe Senate
by John M. Thurston, Mr. Bryan started
upon a lecturing tour of the country, deliv
ering everywhere the one lecture, "The
Free and Unlimited Coinage of Silver at
tbe Ratio of 16 to 1 Without Waiting for
the Consent of Any Other Nation on
Earth." The expense of tbe tour, includ
ing Mr. Bryan's salary, was provided for,
it was said, and it has never been denied,
by an organization composed wholly of
silver miners who were anxious to see the
products of their hills and mountains
doubled in price by Mr. Bryan's plan of
bimetallism.
In point of understanding of the science
and philosophy of government, he stands
some distance below the foot of the long
listof aspirants for the Chicago nomina
tion.
Mr. Bryan has "talked silver" so long,
and so much to the exclusion :of : all other
economic questions, he has almost : per
suaded himself that there is no ailment to
which the body physical or body politic is
heir that doses lof â  silver will i not cure.
In fact, he is almost a silver monomaniac. 4
At v least ;he pretends to believe the ; re
moaetization of silver â is all =â  under * the
shining son that is, needed to make pros
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1896.
perity so superabundant that the people
would cry for a streak of hard times just
to break the horrible monotony of raking
in profits.
On the tariff question Mr. Bryan is for
free trade, pure and simple. He is very
pronounced in the belief that the Govern
ment should be maintained from income
tcxes, and to that end he is in favor of re
vamping the Supreme Court of the United
States so that it will reverse the present
court's decision, which was that an income
tax law would be unconstitutional. These
are only a few of the more leading "quali
fications" of William Jennings Bryan for
theofiiee of President of the United States.
And the once great Democratic party has
come to this ! â¢
A FEW TARIFF FACTS.
The Chicago convention's platform was
constructed, it would appear, under the
impression that the supporters of tbe
Democratic ticket do not or cannot read.
How far that may be true tbe leaders of
that party ought to know, but when they
condemn the Republican tariff act of 1890
"because it restricted trade and deprived
the producers of the great American sta
ples of access to their natural markets,"
they rely rather too much on the credulity
of their following. Let us see how the
McKinley act "ruined" the country.
The returns of tbe bank clearing-houses
in the United States in the year 1392
amounted to $36,602,469,202. In 1595 tbe
returns show the clearings to have been
$29,841,795,922. This indicates a shrink
age in domestic business of $6,820,673,280
for 1895 under the operation of the Demo
cratic tariff as compared with the volume
of trade in 1892 under the McKinley tariff.
These figures represent the transactions of
banks, and then only those situated in
cities large enough to maintain a clearing
house, and it is estimated that bank clear
ings represent not more than 50 per cent
of the total domestic business of the
country.
In 1892, when our tobacco growers were
protected, there were imported 3,073,175
pounds of leaf and wrapper tobacco. In
1895, after the tariff had been greatly re
duced, the cheap-labor tobacco growers of
ether countries shipped to this country
5.680,252 pounds, thus forcing an increase
in imports and a corresponding hurtful
competition, which is represented in the
difference between the above totals, which
was 2,007,077 pounds.
Our wheat exports in 1895 amounted to
$40,898,547 under the Wilson-Gorman act,
and to $101,393,132 under the McKinley
law in 1892. In trying to capture the mar
kets of the world, the Democratic tariff
cost our farmers $120,500,585 in 1895, as
compared with wliat they received in
1892.
The Democratic tariff reduced the im
port tax on rice, which increased imports
from 77.622,464 pounds in 1892, to 136,106.
--809 pounds in 1895, thus throwing 58,484,
--345 pounds upon our markets in direct and
hurtful competition with American rice
growers.
The commodity item of potatoes mates
an important showing. On January 1,
1892, under protection, one barrel of
potatoes would buy twenty-eight pounds
of sugar. On January 1, 1896, one barrel
of potatoes would buy fourteen pounds of
sugar.
In view of these facts, and the same may
be said of tbe entire list of merchantable
commodities, the chances are that the
more the people think what the Chicago
platform proposes to do for them the more
convinced they will be that the tariff act
of 1890 is about the thing they want.
NEW YORK "SUN" FOR M'KINLEY.
The New York Sun, altogether the ablest
and most influential of the Democratic
newspapers of the country, did not wait
until the nominations had been made, but
upon the adoption ot the platform an
nounced its repudiation of the Chicago
convention, its methods, its men and its
measures. The Sun will support William
McKinley, not that it accepts the St. Louis
platform as wholly reflecting the prin
ciples of government as advocated by that
journal, but because the time has come
when it behooves the patriots of the com
monwealth to lay aside party differences
and go forward as one man to defend the
Nation against the assaults of men gone
wild ia their chase after economic vagaries
and who boast of their purpose to over
throw and overturn the basic principles of
the Republic.
Charles A. Dana does not turn the bat
teries of his great newspaper upon his
own political dwelling-place with pride or
exultation. No doubt it is done at the ex
pense of more than one heart string. No
one could be more sincere in devotion to
party principles nor could one do more to
promote his party's welfare than Editor
Dana has done in the years of its struggles
for supremacy; but when the alternative
was thrust upon him to leave his political
home or join with its worst element in
conspiracies against tbe life of the Nation,
it did not take Charles A. Dana long to
decide. Those who know how the New
York Sun has labored in the past to hold
tbe Democratic party to the broad, com
prehensive and patriotic principles of
Thomas Jefferson will know that the Chi
cago convention must have abandoned all
tbe traditions and all for which the party
has stood three-quarters of a century,
which it did.
It needs no prophet to foretell what the
Sun's repudiation of the Chicago conven
tion will lead other Democratic news
papers to do. It may safely be said that
before the month is out there will be
found very few of the old newspaper
wheel horses of the party pulling tbe
Chicago load. A newspaper is strictly a
business enterprise, and it could no more
afford to advocate the employment of rash
and threatening methods in the conduct
of its affairs than a farmer, a manufac
turer, a merchant or a banker could in his.
Nearly every one of the leading Demo
cratic newspapers of the country has been
urging and entreating the rank and file to
turn a deaf ear to the insidious whisper of
the Tillmans and the Altgelds of the party,
but the power of these political serpents to
charm and destroy was greater, it ap
pears, than the power of words of wisdom
to inform and save, and tbe once proud
and defiant rank and file â the majorityâ
of the old Democratic party are now in
the coil of the snakes of their political har
vest field.
"THE SUNDAY CALL"
To-morrow'a issue of Thb Call will be
replete with entertaining and interesting
reading matter, aside from its most com
plete and comprehensive presentation of
all the news of the world, the Nation, the
State and the City.
There are many particularly bright
featurea, all of which are handsomely
illustrated. The Suwday Call is not
made to please the eye alone, but rather
assumes that the reading public of this
City and State have the intelligence and
good taste to appreciate the very best and
highest class of modern journalism. By
this, as readers of Thb Call well know,
is not meant a dry or spiritless journal,
but one that reaches the heart and mind
of all classes and kinds of men and
women, becÂ»uÂ»e v abounds, with
human interest. That is the key
note of modern journalism â human
interest. Realism without vulgarity is
another definition for the same thing.
We have passed the stage when allegories
and fairy tales flatter the dawning intel
lect, and the public to-day want to read of
real men and women and of the actual
romances and wonders and conditions of
an everyday life that is far more fascinat
ing and poetic than life ever was before. It
is rather upon these lines than upon sensa
tionalism and "freakJsm" Thb Call seeks
to intereet its readers, and if circulation
figures mean anything the reading public
appreciates these efforts. And to find the
poetry, the romance, the wonderful and
the human interest in real life one need
not seek far and wide for themâ they are
ever before our eyes, as one can readily
see by scanning briefly this partial list of
features that will be contained iv to-mor
row's issue of The Call:
"The Man Who Was a Prince for a Day
in San Francisco on Two Bits."
"The lnterpenetration of Solids," a

In the village of Pomfret, a lew miles from
Putnam, Conn., lives tbe only surviving
great-great-granddaughter of General Israel
Putnam, Mrs. Mary Putnam Sharpe, who is 84
years old. Her grandmother was General
Putnam's favorite daughter. Â«
Jules Simon left no will, but a short time be
fore his death gave to his friend, M. Leon
Cohn. a bit of paper on which, with feeble fin
perg, he had written his last wishes. Among
them was a request for tbe following inscrip
tion to be placed on his tombstone: '-Jules
Simon, 1814-189 G. Dleuâ Patrieâ LibÂ«rte."
It is Interesting to note that, had it not been
for the act of settlement, the English crown,
by hereditary descent, would have gone to the
family of the daughter of Charles I, and would
now be vested in Mary Theresa of Modena.
This lady can trace her descent in a direct line
to Henrietta Maria, the youngest daughter of
Charles I, who married Philip, Duke of
Orleans.
Count Tolstoi thui describes hit recent
project of starting a newspaper: "I have
butiea myself lately with plans for founding a
newspaper. I wished a newspaper to spread
abroad my ideas. I thought I should like a
newspaper in London, which would give space
to the opinions of my opponents as well as
myself, and be managed by a committee in
which these opponents would have representa
tives. This committee would have to decide
on the articles to be published; the crucial test
in each case would be the sincerity of the au
thor. That was my idea, but I have changed
my mind a little now."
LADY'S TUCKED WAIST.
A charmingly simple model for wash fabrics
isÂ«hown here. The waist has a fitted lining
which may be omitted. The skirt is cut circu
lar in tront, with two gores in the back. The
trimming shown on it above is laid on in bias
folds to similate tucks.
Batistes, mulls, organdiesâ in fact, any other
fabric Is pretty. The sleeve may be cut off at
the puff, as shown in the small figure. A belt
and collar of ribbon is all the adornment
necessary.
A dark blue dimity, with white figures and

AROUND THE CORRIDORS,
Charles H. Keyes, president of the Throop
Polytechnic Institute and president ot the
Pasadena Board of Trade, has just returned
from Sacramento, whither he was called by
Governor Budd and asked to accept the trustee
ship cf the Whittier State Reform School made
vacant last March by the expiration at the
term of Andrew J. Mullin. whose poor health
rendered further duty impracticable.
Mr. Keyes (pronounced Kys) has accepted
the position, the Governor having persuaded
him that his experience in manual training
methods would be particularly valuable when
applied to the coarse of study in the reform
school. The other trustees ate Hon. W. C.
Patterson, president of the Los Angeles Cham
ber of Commerce, and Mrs. Adena Mitchell of
Los Angeles.
After his appointment he visited the Preston
Charles H. Keyes, President of the Throop Polytechnic Institute, President of the
Pasadena Board of Trade, and Just Appointed Trustee of Whittier Reform
School.
School of Industry, the boys' reformatory at
lone. He then came to this City in company
with State Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion & T. Black, who laughingly remarked
yesterday that he is convincing Keyes of the
error of his Democratic ways, has him already
on the run and really believes that tae will
vote for McKinley, though he will not yot
acknowledge it.
Professor Keyes is a tall, distinguished look
ing young man, with hair and mustache of a
silvery gray thai adds considerably to his ap
pearance.
"The Throop Polytechnic Institute," said he,
"has been in existence five years, and two
classes have been graduatedâ twenty-four
students in all. One of the graduates is at the
head of tho sloyd department of the Los
Angeles school. Another is at the head of the
sloyd department of a private school in Los
Angeles. Another is in the Sloyd department
in the Riverside school. One is in the National
Bank at Los Angeles. Another is bookkeeper
in a large mercantile establishment. Another
is instructor in mathematics and mechanical
drawing in Tbroop. Two are teachers in Ven
tura and Santa Barbara" counties.
"Tbe present school plant is worth $110,000,
and was largely the gift of Amos G. Throop
during his lifetime. He also endowed tbe in
stitution with $00,000, none of which, how
ever, is yet available, because of the unsettled
condition of the estate. Tuitions are the prin
cipal source of support, eaoh pupil paying
$105 a year. There are 313 students between
the ages of 14 and 25. A little over two-thirds
of them are boys. The students board in pri
vate families in Pasadena. The seven south
ern counties furnish the majority of the stu
dents, although a number come from Western
and Mississippi Valley States.
"There are twenty-one teachers in all â four of
them women â and, by the way, two of the de
partments are in charge of Stanford graduates
â I*. H. Gilmore, teacher of physics and electri
cal engineering, and Ernest Â£. Hoag, teacher
of physiology.
"All the courses are elective, that is after cer
tain elementary work is finished. We exempt
no student from elementary English and cer
tain fundamental work, mathematics and
physics. Even the mechanical work is elec
tive, but of the 313 students 280 elected to
doit
"The mechanical work consists of an hour
and a half spent each day in the shop and one
to two hours in the draughting-room. At the
same time nothing is eliminated from a sound
education along traditional lines of study.
More than a pure gain ia made by applying
academic principles to the daily shopwork
and drawing.
â 'The Polytechnic Hall contains the wood
working shop, the pattern shop, the forging
shop, the cookine school, the sewing and gown
making department, the mechanical drawing
department and the chemical and physical
laboratories. In East Hall are the offices, the
class rooms in physics, history, English, mathe
matics, Latin, Greek, French, German and
Spanisn; the biological laboratories, the as
sembly ball, tho library, the freehand draw
ing-room, the clay modeling-room, wood
carving room and the sloyd room."

sistant in the library of | Scion College, London,
which proved a step to the ÃbrarUnahip of the
City Liberal Club of tbe great English metropo
lis. In the meantime andforseverai years before
coming to America he was secretary to Herbert
Spencer. In 1890 he was made cataloguer of
the President White Library at Cornell Univer

sistant librarian. His reputation as a hard
student, his familiarity with book*, Ins long

upon the works of Botswlthaâ a prioress of the
middle ages whose writings his discovery
practically made known to the literary world
caused him to be called to Palo Alto in 1892

Three Tugs Towing Vessels Pass
Meiggs Wharf Almost
Together.
CLEVER STEVEDORING WORK.
The Steamers Colon and City of Peking
Leaded at the Mail Dock in
Three Days.
Matters in shipping circles were quite
busy yesterday. Although nearly all the
wharves are deserted there were quite a
number of movements and about 2 p. v.
three deep-water vessels were being towed
to sea. The brie Lurline, in tow of the
Monarch, and the bark Columbia, in tow
of the Reliance, were almost in collision
when passing the seawall. The Columbia
was in ballast and the Lurline heavily
laden, so the Keliance gradually forgad
ahead in the run to the heads. This is
the first voyage the Columbia will have
made in some time. Latterly there has
been nothing for her to do, so she was tied
up in Mission Bay. In the old days she
ranked as a clipper and many a fast run
has she made between New York and
LiverpooL When started coming around
the Horn she kept up her record and since
she has been in the coasting trade her
voyages have all been fast ones.
Right behind the Reliance and Monarch
came the Sea King with the Rufus E.
Wood in tow. She made pood time, but
was only off Lombard street when the
others were abreast of Alcatraz. The tugs
and their tows made the first lively scene
that has been seen on the bay in weeks.
Yesterday morning's thunderstorm
played havoc on the water front. The
lightning flash injured one or two people
and scared half a dozen others half to
death. Chief Wharfinger Root, Sergeant
Jack Hayes of the State Harbor Police
and Dave Creamer were discussing the
gold find in Hurricane Gulch when the
lightning struck. It put out the electric
lights and the wires began to sputter,
! while the telephone bells rang a merry
tune. Hayes did not wait to find out
what was the matter, and he ana Creamer
nearly broke their necks in getting over
i the dividing rail and through the door on
jto the wharf. Chief Root got caught be
tween his chair and the desk and yelled
frantically to the flying twain not to
desert. When the clap of thunder came
jhe broke away and finally reached the
street. The rain drove them indoors
again and their damages were repaired.
On Washington -Btreet wharf Frank
Piper was using the telephone in the
branch office of the Piper-Aden-Goodall
Company when the storm broke. The
I lightning struck the wire and almost
I knocked Mr. Piper senseless. Captain
George Gibson of the Etta B had hold of
the steel shrouds ot the schooner and was
knocked to the deck. A man known as
"Hardworking Tom" was injured on
Jackson street, and/ Amos Rohis was
knocked senseless .vhile at work on the
ferry foundation. Robls had a steel rod
in bis hand and was in connection with
!an iron girder when the flash came. All
j who were injured soon recovered from the
effects of the shock and went to work
again.
Captain Sumnor of the Monadnock will
i inspect the Naval Battalion on board the
j Comanche to-day at 2 p. m. Officers from
: the engineer's department of the Monad
j nock will get up steam on the aged mon
itor and the battalion will be taught how
to work the turrets and lire the machine
guns. The drill will probably last two
hoars, and every member of the com
panies is expected to be in attendance.
Some very smart stevedoring work has
been done on the Mail dock during the
past three days. In that time the steam
ers Colon and City of Peking have both
been loaded, and the former is now on her
way to Panama, while the latter sails for
China this afternoon. The Colon has the
largest cargo aboard she ever took out of
this port, while the Peking has nearly 3000
tons under her hatches. Of this quantity
2200 tons is flour for Yokohama and Hong
kong. In order to load both vessels, the
men worked night and day in two shifts ot j
twelve hours each.
Hughey Smith of the State dredger
added another to his lone list of rescues
yesterday. A man named Andrew John
son fell from t' c coal chutes at Beale street
into the bay, and as he could not swim
came near* drowning. Smith jumped in
and helped him to the dredger, where he
was pulled aboard. In their eagerness to
help Smith the deckhands threw over an
entire coil of rope and the swimmer got
tangled up in it. Finally another was
t Town and he was hauled aboard.
A big fleet of chips will soon be on its
way from Australia. Private advices re
ceived yesterday state that the strike in
the New South Wales collieries is over and
that the men will return to work on Mon
day. There are 101 vessels in Newcastle,
N. 8. W., alone, awaiiine cargoes, and
many of them are listed for San Francisco.
After twenty years of continuous service
'Captain Henry S. Ackley of the steamer
State of California has retired, and Captain
Green of the St. .Paul will take his place.
During all the years he has been a master
Captain AckJey never had an accident
happen to bis vessel. He is now 75 years
of age. and considers himself entitled to a
rest.
Work on the new ferry depot has at last
begun and. now that Judge Slack has de
cided that Colusa stone can be used, rapid
progress should be made. The first two
girders were put in place yesterday, and
| the contractors say it will not take them
j long to make a sood showing. Commis
sioners Chadbourne and Colnon started
for Stockton yesterday to be present at a
i review ot National Guardsmen that is to
i be held by Governor Budd to-day.
Another Austrian war-vessel will visit
ban I rancisco in a few weeks. She is the
training-bng Artemisia, and is coming
here from China via Honolulu. The vessel
only carries two guns, and is used solely
for training sailors for the navy. She will
remain here probabiy a month, and the
boys will receive considerable shore lib
erty.
The Spring Valley Water Company is
determined that there shall be no leak on
the water front. Two special policemen
patrol the front every night to make sure
that no one shall steal water under cover

FIRE AND SMOKE
SHOOT THE CHUTES
The Weil-Known Pleasure
Resort Has a Very
Close Call.
THE TUNNEL BURNED.
William Havice, an Employe,
Barely Escaped With
His Life.
SAVED BY THE FIBE LADDIES.
The Disaster Will in No Way Inter
fere With the Amusements
To-Morrow.
Nothing bat the most unadulterated
good luck saved the Chutes from total
destruction yesterday forenoon.
Two workmen,, one named Doxey and
Westerly End of the Chutes Grounds Where the Fire Burned Oat the Scenic
Railway Tunnel.
the other William Eavice, were tinkering i
away in the tnnnel on the west side of the
enclosure. It is the 370-foot tunnel
.through which runs the scenic railway.
The electric light current haTI been turned
off and they depended mainly upon the
light from a candle to see their way clear
ly. They say the candle did not topple
over and fall into the paint they were
using, but the management, as well as the
underwriters, believe that such an event
occurred. At all events the tunnel caught
fire and for a full hour threatened to wipe
up the Chutes' costly plant.
The inter. or of the tunnel was stretched
with well-painted canvas representing
scenery. Back of this were the tongue
and groove Doards of the outer walls, the
entire structure being something in the
nature of an elevated shaft with draught
power calculated to accelerate any blaze.
Doxey and Havice used the buckets of
water stationed from place to place in the
tunnel, but without avail. In fact, the
fire gained such rapid headway tbat
Havice was almost caught and burned to
death. As it happened, while making his
escape, he had to crawl on hands and
knees oat of the north end of the tunnel.
Engines 30 and 21 were the first on the
scene and, as the names, after destroying
the tunnel, began licking away at the
roof of tne $11,000 casino, recently com
pleted, they turned their streams on the
fire.
There were few people on the grounds
and what might have resulted in a panic
was avoided. The gates were thrown wide
open and the morning crowd had ample
time to make an exit.
The damage will amount to about $2000,
fully covered by insurance.
Sylvain Weill, president of the commit
tee having in charge the Fall of the Baa
tile celebration, was on the grounds early
in the afternoon. Manager E. R. de Tarn
ble of the Chutes assured him that the fire
would in no way affect the coming cele
bration.
"In fact," stated Mr. de Tamble, "we
will have the tunnel and everything else
in perfect running condition by Sunday
next. But we nave certainly had a close
call."
Last week the Chutes people had a com
plete fire apparatus placed on their
grounds, but no connection bad been
made with the water mains. These con
nections were promptly attended to after
yesterday's fire.
DAMAGE TO SHARON ESTATE.
Wednesday's Fire Caused a Lou of
_; 828,000â Yesterday's Fire Alarms.
It will take over $28,000 to cover ' the loss
of Wednesday's fire at 432 Fourth street.
Captain Comstock of the Fire Patrol
busied himself yesterday endeavoring to
ascertain the cause of the fire, but failed.
;. The building, which is owned by the
Sharon : Estate Company, was damaged to
the extent of $7000. L. and E, Emanuel'?
stock of rough material and furniture suf
fered damage to the extent of $12,000. â¢; r
It ;is i estimated that i $8000 & w ill I cover
the : loss of â  Armes & Dallam, dealer* in
wooden and willow ware. John Hoey's
mattress factory was also slightly dam
aged. The loss* on Frowling & Meban's
cigar-box factory will amount to about
$500.
An alarm was sounded through box 158
yesterday at 2:50 a. m., for a fire in a two
story frame building, 931 Harrison street,
occupied by H. C. Bohry as a barber-shop
and dweiling.
A defective chimney caused the blaze.
The building was damaged to the extent
of $175. An alarm from box 152 at 3:10
o'clock yesterday morning called the de
partment out to extinguish a blaze in a
two-story iranie" building at 315 Dore
street owned and occupied by Mrs. H. C.
Mosher as a dwelling. The cause of the
fire, which damaged the building to the
ezteut ot $500, is unknown.
ARE NO LONGER ABUSED
Owing to "Â«* The , Call*" Exposure,
"Drunks" Are . Carried, Not
. ; Dragged, to the Lock-up.
i The Call's exposure of the methods
used in handling "drunks" at the Califor
nia-street Police Station has, to a I certain
extent, resulted in rapid reform. . Men
taken into the station in an unconscious
state of intoxication are no longer dragged
across . the floor , and down the flight of
stairs leading to the lock-up, but carried,
as they always should have been. â 
,It is also safe to assume that in the fu
ture unconscious "drunks" will be suffered
to si' ep off the effects of their debauch and
will not be subjected to kicks, hair-pulling
or. ear-twisting in an endeavor, to procure
their names in order that they may be
properly.; registered.
The jail id still in its old condition and
the stinted quarters are nightly crowded
to overflowing; consequently it is hto be
hoped that in the near future the Super
visors will -cc fit to -. enlarge the jail and
provide comfortable quarters ample
enough to accommodate all who may be
arrested.
WOMEN IN THE PRECINCTS.
Clubs Will Be Gotten Into Work
ing Order in About a
Week.
Miss Hay Says Over a Hundred
Papers Have Declared Editorially
for Woman Suffrage.
"I thought I knew what work was, but
this beats anything in the way of work I
ever heard of."
With this plaintive sentiment Mrs. Long,
the lady organizer of the precinct clubs of
the woman suffrage movement, sank down
exhausted. She had just returned irom a
long tramp in the Western Additioc and
was literally tired out. But worn out
though she was physically, she evinced no
flagging in her devotion to the cause.
"We are progressing splendidly," she
went on, "and in a few days I hope to
have a lot of encouragin g news to report.
When our plan gets to working we will
have about four hundred womp n in vari
ous parts of the City all laboring as one
body for the realization of a common end.
The whole trouble seems to be to get the
thing a going. That is what I am
trying to do now, and though I have a
host of earnest devoted helpers there is
necessarily more or less confusion and an
incredible amount of work. Still all the
indications are most encouraging and the
goodwill of the workers is truly gratify
ing."
At the Woman Suffrage Bureau all was
in a bustle. In one corner a tired-looking
lady had a great number of precinct maps
before her, and with the assistance of half
a dozen others was assigning certain local
ities to the respective committees in
charge. Miss Hay, the chairman, was at
her never-finished task of dictating an
swers to the letters with which the bureau
appears to be perennially inundated.
"The papers can help us a great deal in
this work of precinct organization if they
will," she remarked. "Thus far over a
hundred papers in various parts of the
State have declared editorially in favor of
woman suffrage, and all, with few excep
tions, have referred to our work in terms
of respect Now, if our precinct meetings
can only be reported, just as the men's
nvetings are, our work will be vastly ad
vanced. The meetings will soon com
mence, ana we intend to make tbem in the
highest degree interesting to the public."

ATTACHED FOR
THOUSANDS.
The Sterling Furniture
Company's Big
Debt.
WALTERS' $22,000 BILL.
To Protect Itself, the Carpet
Company Tied Up What
Was in Sight.
HAD TO PAY A JUDGMENT.
No Intention of Embarrassing the
Affairs of the Furniture
Concern.
The Sterling Furniture Company has
been attached for $22,000 and the balance
jon a $5600 judgment due to Dunne <fe
McPike fora client who was injured while
in the se rvice of the tirm.
The attachment was levied by D. N. I
<fe E. Walter, the carpet firm, with \
whom the Sterling Company has dealt for !
years. Yesterday E. 8. Heller, attorney j
for the firm, learned that a balance of
$2800 was due on a judgment of $5600 and
would be paid. The Sterling Company
owed the Walters $22,000 and as Heller
had learned that the Sterling Company
was running behind rapidly 1 , so to pre
vent the payment of the $2800 and to re
tain, as tie said, the money of the strug
gling firm for the benefit of all the cred
itors instead of only one he at once sued
for an attachment and had the firm's
money tied up.
This afternoon the directors of the
Sterling Company will meet and consider
what will be done under the circumstances.
R. G. Davis, president of the company,
refused yesterday to say anything more
definite than that an attachment had been
levied. "We do not know anything about
the case," he said, "except that there is
an attachment. What we will do I cannot
Â»ay, nor can I say just why the attachment
was levied. We will meet to-morrow and
consider the matter."
The Walter Company disclaims any in
tention of injuring the Sterling Company.
One of the members of the firm said yes
terday that the levying of the attachment
was only to protect snch debts as were
owing. "We do not desire to embarrass
the Sterling Company in any way," said
one of the Walters yesterday. "We have
carried them on our books for a long time
and we would carry them longer only we
feared that, what with this paying of
judgments and the accumulation of debts,
we would have a big loss on our hands
unless we piotected ourselves. It was for
this reason we sued fbr the attachment."
The primary idea in levying the attach
ment at this time was to prevent the pay
ment of the balance due on the judgment
received by Dirnne & McPike. This money
is now effectually tied up and the affairs
of the Sterling Company are in abeyance.
They are said to owe about $100,000.

article is entitled "The Democracy Gone

another article the Examiner is taken to

The Harbor Commissioners were acting in a
strictly legal manner when they substituted
Colusa sandstone for Oregon graystone in the
contracts for the construction of the ferry depot
buildings. Judge Slack so decided yesterday.
James F. Martin applied for an injunction to
prevent the substitution and his Honor refused
to issue it despite the fne.t that Martin claimed
that the sandstone is cheaper and an inferior
article to the graystone.
The original contract was awarded to C. F.
McCarthy and the substitution was made with
his consent.

stating that the postoffice had been robbed of
stamps to the value of $54. Thursday night
two expert cracksmen secured admission into

AN EDITOR AND A
CLERK INDICTED,
Newspaper Man for Libel,
the Clerk for Em
bezzlement.
A SERVIAN JOURNALIST.
B. M. Gopcbeivich Libeled Spiro
Radulovich Last
April.
H. LEVI & CO.'S COLLECTOR
Accused of Embezzling Two Thou
sand Dollars of the Firm's
Money.
The Grand Jury heard someexpert testi
mony yesterday concerning the cost of
conducting the County Clerk's office.
There seems to be a strong impression in
the jury that the present management of
that department of the municipal govern
ment is extravagant and that the work
necessary can be done by a smaller num
ber of clerks than the payroll now carries.
The experts examined were ex-County
Clerks J. J. Flynn and M. C. Haley and
Major J. D. Rusgles and B. M. Gunn, who
were formerly employed in the County
Clerk's office. Major Ruggies went into
the County OlerK's office in 1866, and
served there twenty-five years. His ser
vice was continuous until Mr. Curry was
elected, excepting the four years during
which Colonel Stuart Taylor had the place
of Naval Officer, when Mr. Ruggies was his
chief deputy. The jury asked the wit
nesses many questions, ana the result of
the inquiry will be presented in the final
report to be made this month.
The Grand Jury went into Judge Slack's
court and presented the indictments. H.
Batzner was indicted for embezzlement
and B. M. Gopcheivich for libel.
According to the testimony of Jacob
Levi Jr. and Louis R. Levy, H. Batzner
was the clerk, agent and servant of Her
man Levi, Jacob Levi Sr. and Jacob Leyi
Jr. of the firm of H. Levi & Co., and did
embezzle from his employers the sum of
$2000 on March 8 last. It seems that Batz
ner was a collector and held out collections
for his own use.
B. M. Gopcheivich, against whom the
indictment for libel is found, is the editor
and publisher of "Srbin - Amerikanre."
which translated into English is "Servian-
American."
The complaining witness, the man who
was iibeied, is Spiro Radulovich, a very
respectable citizen who resides at the cor
ner of Bush and Polk streets. Judging
from the indictment, to which is attached
several columns of reading cut from the
Servian- American, Mr. Radulovich is not
the kind of a man who can be dismissed
with a single paragraph. The libelous
matter appears to be in the form of a nar
rative or serial story under this heading:
"A Conspiracy Against B. G. (meaning
B. Gopcbeivich)â Historic Fact in San
Francisco â True Occurrence." This pub
lished article or -narrative seems to accuse
Spiro Radulovich of joining a conspiracy
to assassinate the cdi.or. Moreover, it is
asserted in the article that Mr. Radulo
vich, while residing in Weaverville, Trin
ity County, lapsed from integrity and em
bezzled money from his employers.
There was enough in this article pub
lished last April in the Servian-American
to create a great commotion in the Ser
vian colony. No one clearly understands
now why the case was not taken to the
courts, and why the subpenas were not
issued through the regular channels.
About a month ago Eutrene Deuprey,
counsel for Spiro Radulovich, unexpect
edly entered the jury ante-room with an
army of Servian witnesses, and since then
the Grand Jury has struggled with the
case. The case will now go to the courts.
When the indictments were presented
District Attorney Barnes told the court
that no necessity existed for placing the
documents on the secret file. The usual
motion was made for the issue of bench
warrants.
Last Thursday Theodore F. Payne, Al
pheus Bull Jr. and C. L. Haskell of the
Grand Jury, accompanied by Director
Henderson and Inspector Kincaid of the
School Department, visited a number of
public school buildings. The houses in
spected were the Lincoln, Marshall, Rin
enn, Longfellow, Starr King, Columbia,
Buena Vista and the new Dudley C. Stone
school building on Haight street.
ARGUMENTS COMPLETED.
The Becker- Creegan Case Will Go to
the Jury To-liay.
Assistant District Attorney Black closed
the arguments in the Becker-Creegan case
yesterday. He reviewed all the evidence
and made out a very strong case against
the defendants.
Mr. Black laid especial stress upon the
proven fact of the presence of Creegan and
Becker in California in December last;
upon the New York Herald personals and
letters signed "Howe," mailed in New
York City. He claimed that "Howe" and
Creegan are one and the same person.
The discovery of forger's materials in the
possession of Becker and of new $20 pieces
minted in San Francisco in 1895 in the
possession of both Becker and Creegan
was also brought out strongly. The hand
writing of the accused, specimens of which
were secured on different hotel registers

The late domestic quarrel between the
martial array of the Junta and the wor
shipers of Chris Buckley, late leader of the
Democratic "push," has been happily set
tled at last. It was conclusively demon
strated at the meeting of the lroquois
Club last night.
When tbegathering once got into swing
the friction between the two factions set
the political caldron to boiling, and it
hummed merrily all the evening. The
ball was started rolling by John A. Wall,
a Buckleyite.
"Mr. Chairman," he demanded, "I want
to know whether this ratification meeting
to-morrow night is to be under the auspices
of the Iroquois Club or the Democratic
party ?"
President Lemon rose to his feet, and in
classical English informed the gentleman
that itwasunder theauspicesof the Demo
cratic party, which he said had no factions
â whatever. "He said it as if he meant it, but
"Wall wasn't satisfied.
"There is no use in denying, sir," he
emphatically retorted, "that there are fac
tions in the Democratic party. Any fool
ought to see that. Don't you?"
He was hereupon forced to take his seat
and wait for the matter to come up in
regular order.
Peter Kelly, the silver-tongued orator of
the club, walked to the center of the floor
and lauded the California delegation for
its noble work at the Chicago convention.
He was applauded.
Then came the explosion of the fire
cracker that started fun. George H. Fran
coeuer reported what the committee of
which he was chairman had done in the
matter of investigating precinct registra
tion. His advice that a late act might
make it illegal stirred the chairman to
wrath and he took a hand.
Then every member took a hand and
pandemonium reigned. Every man in the
room was on his feet shouting for recog
nition. Motions pro and con were made
with such frequency that a phonograph
would have registered fifty a minute.
Judge Robert Ferral finally poured ver
bal oil upon the sea of ears with which he
was surrounded, the angry waves of dis
cord subsided ana the good bark of har
mony sailed into calm waters.
Then came another merry row, when an
invitation from the Junta to attend their
ratification meeting to-night was read. T.
Carl Spelling wanted the club to accept
the invitation of the Buckleyites also, and
the result that ensued was worse than the
wrangle in a stocK pit.
In rapping for order, Chairman Gilday
jarred a glass off the secretary's desk, and
it broke into 100 pieces.
Thomas Curran accused Spelling of try
ine to bring discord into the meetm g, and
was promptly given the lie.
He said he would make it a personal
matter, but friends managed to prevent
trouble by the use of many gentle, plead
in c: words.
The eonfusion-that ensued whtn the
club decided to attend the Junta ratifica
tion Â§o inspired orator Kelly that he per
sisted in taking the floor "and had to be
seated by the sergeant-at-arm9.
A resolution indorsing Bryan as the
siandaid-bearer of the Democracy was
rushed through with tumultuous applause.
The irrepressible Kelly tried to rise again,
but was sat on by his nearest neighbor.
Then the platform and everything else
in the platform was indorsed. They all
just leaped over one another in hunting
something else to indorse.
It was decided to send congratulatory
telegrams to Bryan and the California
delegation at once. Kelly seconded the
motion with fervid eloquence.
The chairman announced that all would
meet to night, and, with a silver dollar for
a badge, march to the ratification meet
in c.
In this they counted without twenty-five
Buckleyites\ They will go to Metropolitan
Temple.
PREPARING TO CANVASS,
Committees Ready to Start
Raising Funds for the
Carnival.
Plans for Disposing of the Surplus
Expected to Survive the
Festivities.
The special committee appointed at the
meeting held at the Chamber of Commerce
Thursday, to further the interests of the
Carnival of the Golden Gate, met at the
Lick House yesterday afternoon. Nearly
every member was present. All came pre
pared to advocate the immediate work of
raising funds. There was but little dis
cussion on the advisability of holding the
carnival and it was decided that the active
canvass should begin at once.
W. H. Mills and Henry J. Crocrer will
call upon H. E. Huntington, president
of the Southern Pacific Company, at 10
o'clock this morning to ascertain how
much that company, as the largest rail
road corporation in tho CHy, is willing to
invest in the carnival. The next place
they visit "will be the street railway com
panies represented in the Market-street
Railway Company. After this is visited
Mr. Crocker and Mr. Haber will visit other
of the transportation companies, the gas.
electric light and water companies. David
Rich will canvass the real estate men and
Colonel George Stone will visit the hotels.
The committee will meet later in the
afternoon at a place to be designated, and
trom the confident tenor in which many
of the members tpoke about one-half of
the amount needed will probably be
pledged to-morrow ni;:ht. They base their
calculations upon promises made to
others in the committee earlier in the
work, and since the matter received such
an impetus at the hands of the Chamber
of Commerce on Thursday they feel that
their ideas as regards the financial ques
tion are not extravagant. â¢
W. H. Mills was the author of a very
happy suggestion as to the surplus which
will undoubtedly remain after the features
of the carnival are carried out. "For
years," said Mr. Mills, "San Francisco has
beeu handicapped in many ways by the
lack of a proper building in which to bold
monster meetings, grand opera and larjje
musical affairs. No better disposition
could be made of whatever remains after
this carnival than the formation of a fund,
to commence the erection of ?uch a struc
ture, which would be not only a credit to
San Francisco, but would be the means of
bringing thousands of people here.
"The Christian Endeavor convention
has selected San Francisco for its conven
tion next year. Some 30,000 people are
coming here, and it will be a most
auspicious welcome if the managers of the
Carniyal of the Golden Gate thin year will
turn over sufficient surplus to enable ihe
people of San Francisco to erect a build
ing capable of accommodating that many
persons." Mr. Miils also elaborated upon
the idea that such a meeting-place would
attract future political conventions, and
referred to the fact that San Francisco is
seriously handicapped by the lack of a
building large enough to hold a crowd
sufficiently large to make any enterprise
pay.
Invitations are being sent out to all or
ganized bodies in San Francisco notifying
them to elect a delegate who will repre
sent them in the formation of parades dur
ing carnival week. The idea expressed in
the invitation by the committee is that all
societies having a speciiic object could be
represented by a float depicting this fea
ture, for which a prize will be offered,
probably for the best idea, the handsomest
lioat, or such other features as the com
mittee may decide on after they learn
what the societies propose to do. The
committee will exercise great care to pre
vent the introduction of any floats into
the parade that would be likely to cause
offense to any part of the community.
William Gans of 703 McAllister street
is the first party who has applied at head
quarters for a collection-book. Mr. Gans
is well known throughout the Western
Addition and anticipates no difficulty in
raising a considerable sum of money from
the storekeepers in that section.
A general display of carnival colors is
expected to-aay by many of tbe larger
A Corner in the New Headquarters of the Republican State Central Committee.
stores in the City. Since the adoption of
the colors large orders for the blue, gold
and cardinal in all kinds of material have
been placed with the manufacturers in
anticipation of the large demand. Already
many are wearing bits of ribbon in their
button-holes.
The committee on badges, carnival col
ors and regalia will meet at headquarters
this afternoon to decide upon n number
of important features in connection witli
their particular line of carnival work.
The members of the executive commit
tee are rapidly disposing of the tickets for
the benefit performance at the Columbia
Theater on Thursday afternoon next.
The sale of seats will commence on Tues
day, subject to the reservations made at
the auction on that afternoon at the Mer
chants' Exchange. The gross receipts of
the performance will be given to the car
nival fund.
T. A. BURNS UNDER FIRE
: He :la Accused of Embezzling the Pay
of Several Restaurant
Waiters.
Two warrants, charging Thomas A.
i Burns with feloniousembezzlement, were
' sworn out yesterday in Police Court Iby
j Manuel Fernandez and Anton : Huber.
! Burns is a produce merchant at 109 Sev
! enth street. In May, 1895. Meyers' restau
j rant, on Ellis street, was attached by
creditors. â¢ Burns and ' two other creditors
were put in charge of the establishment
to represent all of the claimants, it being
the understanding , that they should keep
the place open at their own Trials
;-, Burns took possession of the place, and
conducted it from one Wednesday to the
I following Sunday, during : which time he
| furnished \ the supplies in bis line at the
I highest market prices, so it was asserted.
I During that time Burns asserted that the
j place had lost $900, and that "the receipts
had amounted to only $300. Those inter
ested were not 'satisfied with this report,
claiming that each table realized from $25
to $30, a day and there ; were thirty -six
tables. . Â. . ;;x
.\ On the Monday morning following the
creditors . released â¢ the . attachment, and
Meyers gave Burns a bill of sale to the proD
ertv. The restaurant was i subsequently
sold for $1100, the purchaser giving Burns
$791 and assuming the responsibility for a
crockery bill for the balance.- He gave the
produce merchant a check for the amount.
i It '- was , the understanding that , Burns
should use this money for the payment of
the hired help in the restaurant, they be
ing the ' preferred creditors under the law.
Their claims amounted to $750. The com
plainants in the criminal action state that
Burns â¢ promised y to - pay them at once.
That was on May 29, 1896. but he neglected
to do, and on one occsion, when the res
taurant employes called at his bouse, there
was a disturbance in which the police had
to interfere. . v ' ; - ; Â» :
From - that time : to the present the
Meyers insolvency case has been dragging
along in the court, ; but the. employes
have not received their money.
Fernandez and Huber decided that they
would not wait an y. 1 / longer, bo they swore
to the complaints as stated. Fernandez
says that Burns owes him $160 and Huber's
claim is , $58. In / all v probability- : about
j twenty more employes' claims of the same
character will be pressed. in the Criminal

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JULY 11, 1896.
ARBITRATION IN
ALAMEDA COUNTY,
Republican Factions Sub
mit to the State Central
Committee.
CONGRESSIONAL PEACE.
Both Factions Satisfied and There
Will Be Harmony at the
Primaries.
ELECTION BOARDS DIVIDED.
The Third District Convention Will
Elect a New . Congressional
Committee.
The Republican State Executive Com
mittee devoted most of its meeting yester
day to settling the factional differences
that have existed in Alameda County over
I the coming Congressional convention of
the Third District.
Fourteen of the members were present
in tbe handsome and convenient new
headquarters on tbe first floor of the Palace
Hotel. H. Z. Ogborr.e of Los Angeles and
Irving B. Dudley of San Diego were pres
ent from tue south. Chairman McLaugh
lin, Secretary M. R. Higgins, John D.
SpreckeJs and A. B. Lemmon of Santa
; Rosa were among tbe others on band.
The committee wre3tled with the Ala
meda trouble for two hours, and then
gave a decision that satisfied both sides,
and which will result in harmony in tbe
I district convention called for the 22d inst.
{in Vallejo, unless the factions break out
j again. The trouble presented for arbitra
! tion and tbe situation out of which it grew,
were briefly as follows:
When the Congressional committee,
before the State convention, decided to
appoint delegates from the counties of
the Third district, some of the Republican
leaders and clubs demanded primaries.
The members of the Congressional com-
I mlttee representing Alameda County
! appointed delegates and a contesting
delegation was elected at the primaries. At
: Sacramento the contesting delegation was
seated. Then it neld a Congressional con
| vention, at which two district delegates to
\ St. Louis were appointed and at which tbe
present acting Congressional committee
j waa created.
Tbe unseated appointed delegates held a
rival convention ajid elected two contest-
Ing delegates to the National Convention.
There tmj contestants were seated and by
this the Congressional convention which
the State Convention repudiated was
recognized.
Not long ago the Congressional com
; mittee created at Sacramento called a con
vention for the 22d inst. to nominate a
Congressman and ordered primaries od
the 15th inst. In all counties supervision
of tbe primaries was delegated to the
county committees, but in Alameda
I County, where the factional split re
j mained, it was ordered that the county
committee should name but two of the
five election officers in each precinct, the
Congressional committee to name two
and the fifth to be selected by lot.
This the county committee, a majority
of which ia controlled by the Denispn fac
tion, would not stand. It was declared
that the Congressional committee was not
a legal one, as the convention from which
it proceeded had not been recognised at
St. Louis. Tho county committee pro
posed to go ahead atfd call an election 'of
its own, refusing to recognize the call un
less it was^ given full control of the
primary. Various compromise propo
sitions were made, but the Congressional
committee refused them and appealed to
j the State Executive Committee to take a
band.
8o the factions assembled from across
the bay. The Congressional Committee
! faction was represented by George L.
i Babcock of Alameda, who was the chief
i spokesman: William Laird Hill, George
| C. Pardee, W. H. Friend and by Charles
L. Pierce, W. A. yon SchmJdt and W. W.
Knickerbocker, members of the present
Congressional committee.
The county committee faction was rep
resented by M. C. Chapman, Rod W.
Church and Charles Mautalen, chairman
of the county committee. Eli Denison,
Georse P. Morrow and W. J. O'Conneli
also came along.
Tbe case was beard in executive session
in tbe presence of both sides. After much
argument, and after a half hour's consid
eration by the committee, the following
derision was rendered.
While not recognising the legality of the
call made by the Congressional committee of
the Third District, this committee, in the in
terest oi harmony, recommends that the call
heretofore issued by said committee be carried I
out, except in Alameda County, where the
County Committee shall have full authority
and responsibility in the holding of the pri
maries.
We further recommend that the County Com
mittee of Alameda County give equal represen
tation to the element represented by the Con
gressional committee; that tbe returns be
canvassed by the County Committee and cer
tified to the district convention anu that the
precincts shall be those lately adopted by the
Board of Supervisors.
The Executive Committee thus avoided
deciding ou tiie legality oi the Cougres
sional, recognizing it as a de facto com
mittee. Both sides expressed satisfaction
with the decision and departed. The call
provides that a new Congressional Com
mittee shall be elected at the convention.
The rest of tbe proceedings of the Ex
ecutive Committee consisted of intormai
discussion of campaign prospects.
VETOED BY THE MAYOR.
His Honor Does Not ApproTe or the
Private Contract Ordiuauee for
Street Work.
Mayor Sutro sent the ordinance reviv
ing the private contract system of doing
street worir back to the Board of Super
visors yesterday without his signature.
The Mayor contends that under the sys
tem of public bids for street woric the tax
payers get more for their money than
under the proposed lÂ»w and that tbe or
dinance ia unjust in that it does away
with the safeguards thrown around the
interests of the citizens by previous regu
lations.
_ He also objects to the measure because
it authorizes the collection of money on
street work before it is accepted and be
cause it does not protect the property
owners who refuse to sign private con
tracts.

PORTLAND RATES
HAVE GONE UP,
Result of the Conference
Held Yesterday at
Portland.
NEW FARES ANNOUNCED
They Will Go Into Effect on the
Steamers Within Ten
Days.
KAIL BATES NOT YET FIXED.
The Special Oregon Train to Be With
drawnâFreights Not Yet
Acted Upon.
Whoever wants to travel to Portland on
the existing low rates will have to do so
within the next ten days.
Peace, and presumbly harmony, was re
stored between the Southern Pacific Com
pany and the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation Company yesterday* and the im
mediate result is an advance in rates be
tween San Francisco and Portland, which
will go into effect on the steamship line on
the 21st inst., and probably on the same
date on the rail route.
General Manager E. McNeill of the Ore
gon Railway and Navigation Company ar
rived in Portland a few days ago, and
learning this fact Traffic Manager J. C.
Btubbs of the Southern Pacific Company
.wired him requesting an interview with a
view of settling the rate war that has been
in progress for ten months past. McNeill
responded favorably and on Tuesday night
Mr. Stabbs. accompanied by H. R. Judah,
assistant general passenger agent, and
William Sproule, assistant general freight
agent of the Southern Pacific Company,
proceeded to Portland to confer with M"r.
McNeill.
Tho definite result of the conference
was the receipt yesterday of a telegram by
F. F. Connor, the local agent of the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company, in
forming him that steamer rates were to be
advanced from $5 to $12 for first-class fares
and from $2 50 to $6 for second - class.
These will go into effect on the steamer
Columbia, leaving Portland on the 21st
inst., and on the State of California, leav
here on the 22d. Bnt two more steamers
will leave here under the war ratesâ one
on Sunday next and another on the 17th.
On the State, which leaves, here on Sun
day, every regular berth was taken on
Thursday, and tickets are now being sold
which provide sleeping accommodations
on the floor. Only ten or twelve of these,
however, are sold on any one ste&mer.
No word was received at the office of
the railroad company yesterday as to
what rates would be put in under the new
deal, but it was stated that the special
train, which has been operated to leave on
the days when steamers departed, would
probably be taken off altogether, and the
present rates of $10 for first-class passage
and $5 for second-class would in conse
quence be abolished. Under ante-war
conditions the price of a thirty-day first
class ticket was $25, of a rirst-clans five-day
ticket $20, and of a second â¢ class
ticket flu 50. The last named included a
berth, but on the other two the berth
charge was extra, and waa $5 for the two
nights occupied in part of the journey.
The cut rate of $10 and $5 respectively in
cluded bertha.
It is stated that a $20 first-class ticket,
with a five or ten days' limit, will now be
placed on sale, and a $12 second-class
ticket. The $25 tickets will probably be
withdrawn. Mr. Judah is expected back
to-day and railroad ratea will then be
definitely announced.
Thus far nothing has been done to
change freight rates, but it is expected
that these will be advanced also as the
result of the Portland conference.

Republicans, City. There was published, in
Answers to Correspondents in the issue of The
Call of June 29, a half-column answer in rela
tion to the siiver question. These correspond
ents are referred to that.
Old Coinsâ M. X., City. The sun dial coin
you name in your letter is one of a number of
coins almost similar in pattern that were
minted as experimental coins in Continental
days. For such a one as you describe dealers
will give 10 cents. There is no offer for a
Mexican Maximihau dollarof 18t>7. Forsuch
dealers charge from $ 1 75 to $2 50.

posite Portsmouth Square, along Kearny street
to Market, to Page, to Baker, to the entrance
to the panhandle of the park, out through the
park and thence along the Ocean highway to

nigh schools of the State, nor is there any pro
vision far such medals. County boards may
adopt resolutions to the effect that no medals
shall be distributed in the district over which
they have control.
Morphineâ o. S., City. This department does
not recommend the method of any specialist
for the cure of the morphine habit. A person
addicted to the use of morphine may, if It has
not taken too tirm a bold, conquer it by will
power. The amount of suffering t jch a resolu
tion wouid entail would depend to what ex
tent the person had been a user of the drug.
The Shakers-A. 8., City. The census of
1890 shows that in the United States there
were 2400 Shakers, divided into eighteen
secieties, as follows: Three in New York, four
ia Massachusetts, two in New Hampshire, two
in Maine, one in Connecticut, four in Ohio,
and two in Kentucky. In any of the modern

: account of the Society oi' Shakers. A history of
this sect cannot.be reproduced in this depart
ment for want of space.
General Woolâ M. E., City. This is the
second time you have asked about the arrival
of General Wool in this City. The question
was answered October 14, 1893, but as you
have probably forgotten the dato of arrival it
is given again. The steamer, John L.Stephens,
with General John Ellis Wool and Lieutenant
Hardie, his aid, on board, arrived in this port
on the 14th day of February, 1854. General
Wool relieved General U. W. Halleck on the
, 17th of the same month and was in charge of
the Department of the Pacific until 1857.
Marriageâ A. B. C, Sonoma County. If you
have knowledge that an effort is being made
to marry a. crippled, imbecile girl of 13, with
the consent of her parents, to a man of 73,
you ought to lay the facts of the case before
L the County Clerk of the county in which a
license is to bo applied for. and it is very lifce
â¢ ly that the official would reiuse to issue the
license asked for, on the ground that the girl
is not physically able to enter the married
state. In some parts of the Union parents
â¢ who would attempt to bring about such a
. marriage would be treated to a style of dress
that cannot be purchased ready made in the
' stores.
Father op His Countryâ J. A. M., City. A
few years ago Judge Pennypacker of Phila
delphia in an address before the Pennsylvania
1 German Society said: "I have brought with me
a specimen of these (oldtime German) al
manacs printed in Lancaster, Pa., in 1779. Its
i special interest consists in tue fact that in it
I for the first time General Washington was
: called the father of his country. You can see
I upon the title page a representation of fame.

"Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep"â X. X. X.,
City. The author 'of "Now I Lay Me Down to
Sleep" was "Mr. Rogers, the Martyr." In an
almanac dated 1691, in the possession of the
j Boston Historical Society, appears the follow-
I ing advertisement: "There is now in press
and will suddenly be extant a second .m
--presii.m of the New England Primer, en
larged, to which is added more directions for
spelling the prayers of R. Edward VI, and
verses made by Mr. Rogers, the Martyr, left as
! a legacy to hi* children." A copy ot this
primer dated 1775 has in it, among "the verses
made by Mr. Rogers, the Martyr," the well
known "Now 1 lay me down to sleep."
Santa Anna's Cork Legâ X. X. X., City. Santa
Anna's cork leg is now in the Patent Office at
Washington, D. C. The general and the leg
parted company at Cerro Gordo. He was so
closely pursued that he took a mule to ride
away, leaving the cork leg in his car
riage. Two companies of the Fourth
Illinois Regiment were the first troops
to reach the carriage and Private Abe
Waldren of Company G was the first to -ay
hands on it. Sergeant Gill and Privates Sam
and Frank Rhodes of the same company bought
the leg for a small sum and rook it home with
them to Pekin, 111. In 1862 they sent it to
General McCook at. Washington, and he
placed it in the Patent Office.
Second Artilleryâ S., City. What prior
to the great upset in the National Guard by
Governor Budd was known as the Second
Artillery Regiment waa originally organized
as the First Infantry Battalion on the 18th of
May, 1861. It was reorganized as the First
Regiment of Artillery on the 3d of April, 1863.
It was then reorganized as the Second Regi
ment of Infantry on the 23d of August,lÃ66. Its
I designation was changed to Second Artillery
! Regiment June 1, 1881. On the 24th of Jnne
I 18b7, at the old Grove-street armory, "Judge J.
F. Sullivan, on behalf of the lady friends ot the
regiment, presented to it a stand of colors, and
on the 27th of May, 1892. Miss A.M. Geary, on
behalf of a committee of ladies, presented a
stand of colors to the regiment to replace the
one previously presented, and which had be
come faded and worn.
In God We Trustâ F. M., City. A half dol
j lar of 1850 without the motto "In God We
Trust" is not a scarcity, and is worth only its
face value. Prior to 1864 no coin of the
United States bore that motto, a writer
who looked up the matter gives the
following account of the placing of
the motto on the coins: "The introduction
of a motto or device on the coins had been
suggested many times more or less directly,
! but the suggestion that was finally adopted
' came from a Maryland farmer. In 1861,
j when Salmon P. Chase was Secretary of the
I Trearury, this old farmer suggested that, aswe
claimed to be a Christian people, we should
indicate our profession on our coinage. The
letter was referred to James Pollock, the Di
rector of the Mint, who in his report for 1862
discussed the question ot the recognition of the
sovereignty of God and our trust in him on
our coins. The proposition to introduce~him
on our coins, he said, hnd been favorably con
sidered by Mr. Chase, ana he did not doubt
that it would meet with approval by an intelli
gent public sentiment. But Congress gave
I no attention to the suggestion, so in his next
annual report he again referred to the subject
as follows: 'The motto suggested, "God Our
Trust," is takeu from our National hymn,
"The Star-spangled Banner." The sentiment
Is familiar to every citizen of our country; it
has thrilled the hearts and has fallen in
I song from the lips of millions of American
freemen. The time is propitious; 'tis an hour
of National peril and daDger, Â«n hour when
man's strength is weakness and salvation
must be of God. Let us reverently acknowl
edge his sovereignty and declare our
trust in God.' A two-cent bronze piece
was authorized coined the following year
(April 22. 1864), and upon this was
first stamped 'In God We Trust.' By an
act of Congress, March 3, 1865, the Director of
the Mint was authorized to place the motto on
ali gold and silver coin."

Engagement Announced of
Miss Catherwood and
Dr. Grinell.
THEY MET AT CORONADO
Pleasant News Told at a Dinner
in Honor of General
Forsythe.
A BELIE AND AN HEIRESS.
T:e Groom Is a Promicent New Yorl
Pnysic'an and Distinguished
Yale Man.
The engagement is announced of Miss
Jennie S. Catherwood and Dr. Morton
Grinell.
The announcement was made last even
ing at a dinner at the Presidio given by
Mrs. Darling in honor of General For
syihe.
Seated at r the table were brave officers
and charming women, who offered their
congratulations and drank to the health
and happiness of the young couple in
bumpers of champagne.
Miss Catherwood, the fair young bride
to be, is the youngest daughter of Mrs.
Darling, wife of the gallant major of the
Fifth Artillery.
Since her debr>t in society three seasons
aso Miss Catherwood has been a favorite
as well as a leading belle. Having been
educated in Paris and London and spent
the greater portion of her short life abroad,
the young fiancee combines that rare mod
est charm of the European maiden with
the delinhtful piquancy of the American.
The result is a delicious mannerism that
captivates all that have the good fortune
to meet her.
As far as accomplishments go Miss
Catr.erwood has all the cultivated talent?
that distinguishes the modern, highly ed
ucated girl. She has devoted, however,
most of her time to the cultivation of her
voice, a rich and pleasing mezzo-alto. Its
cultivation she owes to the celebrated
teachers Marchessi and Belari.
Nature has been more than kind to Miss
Catherwood. Not only has she endowed
her with rare mental qualities, but lav
ished upon her rare personal charms &s
well. She gave her a beautiful face and
marked it all over with unmistakable signs
of a bright and happy disposition, and she
crowned it with a mass of fluffy hair that
just escaped being golden.
Fortune has also smiled upon this young
lady. By the will of her grandfather, the
late Judge Hasiincs, Miss Catherwood was
handsomely provided for. He bequeathed
her $50,000 and an interest in theHasiing'a
deed trust, her share of which renresents
$300,000.
Dr. Morton Grinell, the fortunate man,
is a celebrated New York specialist and a
distinguished Yale man. Socially as well
as professionally he occupies a very high
position in New Y'ork's exclusive set. He
is a member of the Univertity Club of
New York and of the Scroll and Keys, the
very exclusive Yale club that corresponds
to the "Hasty Pudding" of Harvard.
Dr. Grineil is a descendant of an old
French family who-^e name is closely iden
tified with, the stirring epochs of French
history. A lasting monument to his
noble family is the Boulevard Grinelleand
La Place Grinelle, Pans, named after them.
Miss Catherwood and Dr. Grinell met at
Coronado early in the spring, and their en
gaeement followed shortly afier. They
will be married at the Presidio early in
November. Dr. Grinell has been offered
a prominent professorship at a leading
New York medical college, but has not yet
decided to accept the position. If he does
not the young couple will pass the next
four years in European travel.
The guests who were present at the din
ner, when the announcement was made,
were: General Forsythe, Lieutenant Bell,
the Misses Young, Miss Catherwood and
Major and Mrs. Dariing. The dinner was
followed by a reception for young people.
INDORSING M'KINLEY.
Strong Resolutions Adopted by the
Republican Executive Council of
California.
Mrs. J. M. Bailey ana Addie L. Ballou,
representing the Women's Republican
Club, participated in the discussion on
the present political issues last evening, at
the regular meeting of the Republican
Executive Council of California.
Mrs. Ballou stated that she desired to
withdraw the names of Nellie Holbrook-
Blinn and Mrs. Dr. Oimsted as representa
tives in the council, as they were nnable
to attend the meetings. She proposed at
another session to present two other can
didates lo fill the vacancies.
The name of Representative Owen, from
the Forty-third District, was withdrawn
by R. H. Warfield and that of James Kip
substituted.
The absence of Secretary Oscar Tolle
necessitated the filling of his position by
H. M. Williams, while President M.Cooney
rilled the chair, excepting when he called
on Vice-President K. Briggs to preside.
Judge Firebaugh presented the follow
ing resolutions, that were unanimously
passed :
Resolved, That tne Republican Executive
Council of California heartily Indorses the
platform of the principles promulgated by the
Republican National Convention at St. Louig.
Resolved further, That this coucil indorse the
nomination of McKinley and Hobart us Presi
dent anrt Vice-President of the United States
believing that their election is necessary to the
return of prosperity to tbe American people
and the perpetuation of Republican institu
tions.
Among the speakers during the even

B. Morion.

BURGLARS FOILED
BY A NEWSBOY.
He Informs Captain Lees of
a Bold Plot to Rob
a House.
AN ERSTWHILE ROBBER.
A Detective Joins the Gang and
Leads Them Into a Neatly
Laid Trap.
THEY ABE NOW IN THE TANKS
Thought to Be Guilty of a Half Dozen
Burglaries Committed in the
Same Neighborhood.
la the tanks at the City Prison are two
men who will be charged with robbing the
house of Mrs. Conreitch, 611 Eddy street,
as soon as the detectives have completed
their efforts to trace some half dozen rob
beries committed within the last three
weeks to the same parties.
In the meantime the accused men are
down in the "small book," and the police,
with customary discreetness, refuse to give
their names or even talk about the case.
However, the capture made by Captain
Lees on information furnished by a
newsboy is regarded in police circles as
most important. Outside of this it carries
all the sensational features of an up-to
date novel, including a detective turning
robber â the thieves searching the jewel
box, only to find that the precious gems
have been abstracted, and then the cli
maxâstaiwart policemen issuing from
secret biding places and commanding the
midnight maurauders to surrender.
The story as told by the neighborsâ Mrs.
Conreitch refusing to talk until given per
mission to do so by the detectives â em
braces all the features above recorded and
others equally thrilling but old. Last
Thursday night shortly after 8 o'clock a
newsboy loitering along Eddy street, near
Taylor, observed two men engaged in
earnest conversation. As he was about to
pass his quick ear caught the word "rob,"
followed a second later by "611 Eddy."
Under some pretext the boy managed lo
remain within earshot without exciting
suspicion, the result being that he learned
the whole plot.
Quick as bis little legs could carry him
the boy was oil to the Central Station and
there told what he had heard. Captain
Lees at once detailed a man on the case
said to be Detective Seymour â and later
conceived a neat scbeme to effect tbe cap
lure of the would-be burglars. The detec
tive called at the house of Mrs. Coureitch
and attempted to tell that lady of the plot
10 rob her house. But the landlady would
have nothing to do with him, fearing that
her reputed savior was one of the robbers.
Disgusted at his reception, the detective
retired, to return a few minutes later with
a couple of officers and a star displayed
conspicuously on his own breast.
This time Mrs. Conreith was willing
enough to believe the atory, and readily
ag:eed to secrete officers in any manner
or place desired. This much accom
plished the detective retired temporarily
from the scene.
Just how the detective managed it is not
apparent at present, but in a short time
he met the robbers and was soon a "boon
companion." The bftrglars took their
new-found friend into their confidence,
the detective, of course, falling; greedily in
with the scbeme. He was willing to do
anything which promised a fair return for
the time and labor invested.
At 1:30 o'clock Friday morning the
three men arrived at 611 Eddy street, and
without much ado cast about for the most
available entrance. It was finally deter

work, and in a trice the three men were
into the parlor discussing what was the
next best thing to do.
Into the next room they went, and there
conveniently placed was tho coveted jewel
case. It was but the work of a moment
to open the prize, but gladness was turned
to anger when only the shining silk lining
met their gaze.
Just as the men angrily tossed the case
to one side, two policemen came into
view and with leveled revolvers demanded
"hands up." In a second the two real
burglars were securely handcuffed and the
story has it that the detective submitted
to a similar operation in order to keep up
the farce before the real culprits.
The men were hurried to the prison and
placed in the tanks, excepting, of course,
the detective who had so cleverly led them
into the trap.
Within the past three weeKs more than
half a dozen robberies have been com
mitted in the immediate neighborhood of
611 Eddy street. It is thought by the
police that the men now under arrest are
guilty of all these outrages.
Mrs. Conreith, acting under instructions
from Captain Lees, refused to talk about
the case, though she admitted that the
facts as here related are correct.

CRUELTY ON THE INCREASE
Secretary Holbrook of the S. P.
C. A. Notices a Frequency
of Cases.
Three Men Arrested for Driving
Horses With Diseased Necks
and Shoulders.
"It is strange aDd disheartening," said
Secretary Holbrook of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals yester
day, "to observe the frequency with which
unoffending and useful dumb brutes are
mistreated. Cases of cruelty to horses
have become so common that nobody
seems to speak of them, while even the
newspapers barely mention themâ if, in
deed, they notice them at all.
<; For example, to-day the officers of this
society arrested three men for driving
horses with sore shoulders. I suppose
there is no 'story' in the case, yet if the
poor horses could speak they might reeard
tbe matter differently. For some time a
number of teams have been engaged in
leveling a road to tbe park in the vicinity
of the Ahnsliouse.
"Among the horses were several whose
necks and shoulders were festering. The
men in charge of the work had been urged
more than once to replace these suffering
beasts with others in a healthy condition,
but to no purpose. To-day we placed tbe
foreman and two of his assistants under
arrest, and I for one hope that an exam
ple will be made.
"This sort of thing should cease. If the
perpetrators of these and similar cruellies
could be held up before the public in their
true light, I am sure the very shame of
the thing would deter others from the
commission of deeds of this sort."

YOUNG LADIES OF
TIE INSTITUTE.
A Grand Ball Last Night
in Native Sons'
Hall.
VARIOUS AMENDMENTS.
Yesterday's Session Marked by
the Enaction of Several
New Laws.
BISHOP MONTGOMERY'S WISH.
Associate Members W ll Now Be
Admitted on Certain Pre
scribed Conditions.
The Young Ladies' Institute convened
yesterday morning earlier than usual in
order to dispose of the mass of amend-
I nients submitted by the various delegates.
| This was by far the most important ses
j sion held yet, so far as the actual trans
action of business is concerned.
Tbc first amendment to come before the
institute dealt with the taking of appeals
in regard to sick benefits. Formerly there
was no time limit, but now an appeal
must be taken within thirty days after the
decision has been rendered.
After considerable discussion it was de
cided to let the death benefit remain at
$150. The rules of order also remain un
changed.
Another important amendment was one
pettlinrj tne status of associate members.
Heretofore no associate members were
permitted. It was decided that associate
members cannot receive death benefits
nor vote on them. Neither will they be
permitted to hold office. The age limit
was fixed at seventeen years.
The discussion of tne foregoing took np
all the time of the morning session, and
after the amendment in regard to associate
members had been passed an adjournment
was taken till 2 p. M.
In the afternoon, before proceeding to
business, a telegram from Bishop Mont
gomery was read to the institute. The
text was as follows:
San Lots Obisfo, July 10.
MUs Joirte Malloy. Grand Secretary of the Yovna
Ladies' Institute: Wish council every success
for tin 1 good work. George Montgomery.
The next amendment was on the ques
tion of honorary members. As the law
now reads they may be admitted at the
discretion of the president, providing that
! not more than five be admitted into one
branch.
The regulation of sick benefits was
placed in the by-laws of the different
branches. A limit of not over $7 and not
less than $1 per week was placed in the
I authority of the branches.
Hereafter members $3 in arrears will
stand suspended. The secretary is no
I longer required by the constitution to
no ify members in arrears, but this matter
is left entirely with the by-laws.
The report of the headquarters com mi t
: tee showed that the fund for establishing
a headquarters contains 51125. This fund
I was formed by a tax of two per cent on all
! receipts.
Several amendments were also made to
the by-laws of subordinate institutes. This
completed the work of the day, and a
recess was taken till this mornine.
In the evening a ball and banquet was
held in Native Sons' Hall, which wae one
of the most successful evenis of the season.
The hall had been decorated with bunt
ing, pule blue and yellow shades being
festooned in an artistic manner over the
immense room. The emblem of the order
abounded, and flowers exhaling fragrant
odors were everywhere.
The grand march was led by Miss Sophia
A. Grove and her brother, Frank Grove.
Following were the committees for the
occasion :
Floor committeeâ Philip Lawier, Dr. D. F.
Rapan, J. T. Greaney. J. F. Dwyer, J. J.
O'Biien, Jere Looney, Emmet Hayden and L. Q.
Haven.
Reception committee â Kate Fitspatrick,
Kate Desmond, Ella Comyns, Kate Kennedy,
Delia Curran, Mrs. Nellie Lucy and Mrs. Mary
Kentzel.
James A. Brien acted as floor director
and John C. Comyns and J. Fred Grote as
assistant floor directors.
NUEVO POTRERO
IS UP IN ARMS,
Property â¢ Holders Object
Vigorously to the
Pesthouse.
DEMAND ITS REMOVAL.
Present Location Declared to Be a
Menace to Health and
Progress,
POLICE PROTECTION SECURED.
Thanks Returned to Chief Crowley and
Other Officials for Courtesies
Extended the District.
The Nuevo Potrero Improvement Club
is in deadly earnest in its demands for the
removal of the Pesthouse from its dis
trict. At its meeting last evening the
members were enthusiastic in their con
demnation of the present location.
A. A. Schumann occupied the chair ana
L. J. Puyer acted as secretary. Rev.
Stubbs of the hospital committee reported
that at the last meeting of the committee
they had decided to have posters and
placards placed in publi places calculated
to alarm the residents of tfc* district to the
danger of having a new Pesthouse erected.
The president stated that the executive
committee bad considered the matter and
had concluded that the method suggested
was not wise.
L. J. Dwyer stated that the Federated
Improvement Clubs had declared in favor
of advocating State aid in the location of
the Pesthouse. "It seems to me, how
ever," he said, "that it is to our interest to
push this matter ourselves without
depending solely on the San Francisco
improvers. If we urge the matter the City
ofncials will have to do sometning very
soon. We should ask the Mayor and the
Board of Health to locate this Pesthouse,
and I move you that it is the sense of this
club that the Pesthouse be not located
upon the City and County Hospital tract,
and that it be located without this section
of the City entirely."
The sentiments expressed were heartily
indorsed and the motion was unanimously
cariied.
Rev. Mr. Rtubbs said he haa communi
cated with the Chief of Police and the
latter had promised to furnish all police
protection necessary to the district. Two
patrolmen have already been furnished,
and the good effects are already evident.
In view of the courtesy extended by
Chief Crowley, Captain Spillane, Lieu
tenant Bennett and Officer Stanton, he in
troduced a resolution expressing the
thanks of the club to these officials. The
resolution was passed by acclamation.
William Siebert called attention to the
necessity of an additional primary school
in the district. In order to urge the mat
ter properly it would be necessary to as
certain the number of children of school
ase within the district embraced, and Mr.
Dwyer volunteered to attend to the mat
ter.
The matter of improving Arkansas
street was brought up by G. Scnier. He
said there was a petition being circulated
to put a sewer in the street. He was not
opposed to the improvement, but thought
that before the sewer was put in he would
insist on the proper grade being estab
lished. Other property-owners" affected
spoke in the same strain. On motion of
Mr. Antonson the matter was referred to
the street committee.
Mr. Antonson called attention to the
necessity of fire-alarm boxes in the vicin
ity. Mr. Dwyer made a motion that the
executive committee correspond with the
Board of Fire Commissioners and such
committee of the Board of Supervisors
having jurisdiction, tending to better lire
protection in the district.
The motion was carried.
It is the intention of the club to get a
fire engine and hose wagon in the district
if possible. This provision was made for
them during the period of extra danger
last week, and the members of the club
believe it should be made permanent.
Mr. Dwyer spoke enthusiastically of the
good work being done by the San Fran
cisco Improvement clubs. He spoke also
of the great earnestness of the people of
the Nuevo Potrero in trie agitation to re
move the Pesthouse. "Let every property
owner out here join this club," he said,
"and devote his best energies in this ques
tion. You can accomplish something by
agitation. If you want this hospital re
moved you can only accomplish it by a
concert of action.
"You have got to show these officials
that you mean business. If they do not
wish to study your interest you must
teach them a lesson when they come up
for your suffrage."
An earnest protest was made against
any money being expended in improving
the present City- and County Hospital.
The club is primarily in favor of remov
ing the hospital from the neighborhood,
but if this be not done they would be
partially satisfied if a sanitary and seemly
building was erected.

The entire control of the advertising
agency conducted under the name of
Remington Brothers at fittsburg and
New York passed into the hands of R. R.
Remington June 18, by the purchase by
him of his brother's interest in the con
cern. R. R. Remington has always been
the active head of the business and is
widely known.
In 1890 R. R. Remington opened a
branch office in New York City, taking
charge personnlly and dividing his time
between New York aud Pittsburg.
The growth of the New York office has
been greater than that of the home office,
especially during the past year, during
which time it has been run independently
of the Pittsburg office. During the last
year all the regular routine work regard
ing the business of the New York office
has been done there, tnus facilitating the
business considerably.
The Remington agency makes a spe
cialty of placing advertising in two
classes of papersâ a county seat list and
large city dailies.â The Newspaper Maker.

THE FIELD OF SPORT.
What the Oarsmen, Athletes and
Cyclists Are Doing.
The National Club is chagrined because
or the refusal of the Supervisors to grant
it a license to conduct a boxing entertain
ment at the Pavilion next month. The
managers of the club state that if they
had the remotest idea of the intentions of
the City Fathers they certainly would not
have incurred the expense they have al
ready gone to in consummating a match
between Maher and Choynski. They will
make another attempt to soften the hearts
of the good fathers.
The Olympic Club will endeavor to bring
about a second meeting between its ath
letic team and a team of athletes from the
Muitnomah Athletic Club. A return
match between the athletes who con
tested in the Nortnwest will certainly at
tract a great gathering at the Olympic
Club grounds.
The oarsmen of this City and Stockton
are haying a friendly discussion over row
ing matters. The local scullers are deter
mined to have the next regatta held on
this bay, but the Stocktonians contend
that the sport would be a far greater suc
cess, financially and otherwise, if held
within easy reach of their city, and thus
the matter stands at present.
Coursing enthusiasts are promised a
great day's sport to-morrow at Ingieside
Park, where the fastest greyhounds in the
State will contest.
The anglers are now scattering all over
the country and favorable reports from
mountain streams and lakes arrive daily.
Inanimate target shooting is a pastime
which has become very popular within the
past year; as will be seen by a reference
to the department that refers to the gun
there are quite a number of club matches
slated for to-morrow.
THE WHEELMEN.
Twenty- Mile Road Race of the As-
sociated Clubs.
To-morrow morning at 10 o'clock the
big twenty-mile race of the California As
sociated Cycling clubs will start on the
San Leandro road, full particulars of
which were eiven in yesterday's Call.
The preparations for the race are com
plete and the men are all in good form.
There is not as much uncertainty attend
ing the result of this race as there was re
garding the relay, and it is generally con
ceded ty those in a position to know that
the Acme Club of Oakland has the strong
est team entered and stands the best show
of winning.
On Sunday, July 19, the annual picnic
run of the association will be held at Coy
ote Point Beach, near San Mateo, and will
be attended by nearly all of the clubs be
longing to the association.
At their last meeting the Alpha (ladies')
Cycling Club elected the following officers:
President, M. McCarthy; vic?-president,
A. Wynne; secretary, Dorothy Pender
gast: treasurer, N. Magoire; sergeant-at
arius, M. Madsen; captain, M. Mahony;
first lieutenant, L. L. Egeberg; second lieu
tenant, L. M. Lange. To-morrow the club
will have a run to San Leandro to witness
lhe road race.
The Reliance Club Wheelmen have a j
picnic run to Lake Chabot on the cards for
Sunday, July 26.
Oscar Osen of the Olympic Cyclers is
trying to arrange a match race between
himself and a trotting horso, to take place i
at Petaluma Sunday, August 2.
James W. Coffroth of the Olympic Cy
cltrs, has returned from his trip to Port
land.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen will hold
a five-mile handicap road race over the
San Leandro-Haywards course Sunday,
August 2. What makes the race of more
than ordinary interest is the fact that J.
E. Wing will ride from scratch, paced h?
tandems, and will endeavor to lower the
world's five-mile road record of 11:112-5,
held by George Hamlin of the San Fran
cisco Road Cub.
G. A. Wahlgreen of the Cycling West of
Denver is in the City on a business trip.
Mr. Wahlgreen was" here last fall and is
very popular with the club wheelmen.
Charles W. Etting, secretary of the Pa
cific Cycling Club, furnishes the readers of
The Call with the following interesting
account of the run of his club on the
Fourth of July to Santa Cruz:
On Saturday morning, July 4, Captain Law
rence W. Pryor, Adolph Herbst, Altred Bach
Fred M. Hartter, Herbert R. Hicks and Ernest
E. Erbe, members of the Pacific Cycling Club,
started for Santa Cruz via Congress Springs
and Boulder Creek. The start was made from
Ninth and Market streets loDg before most
people were out of bed â 4:30 a.m. As guests
they had Messrs. Cullen and Pinching of the
Olympic Cyclers and Mr. Brady of the Cali
fornias.
Starting down Ninth street the route then
continued to Brannau, to Potrero avenue,
thence to San Bruno road. The morning was
somewhat cloudy Dut warm, and tne boys rode
at a good pace, reaching San Mateo at 6
o'clock, an hour and a half after starting, the
distance being twenty miles. From San Mateo
the roads weie mucii better than they had ex
perienced along the bay road. Redwood City,
nine miles, was reached at 6:45, where break
fast was hud. At 7:15 a. m. the start was again
made, and with an easy pace Mountain View
was reached at 8:30. From this point to Con
gress Springs a pretty lively pace was set by
E. Erbe. and although it was upgrade, they all
arrived at this point in good condition at 9:45.
At Congress Springs another stop was made,
and after partaking of a hearty meal and
plenty of Congress water they again started at
11 :30 and moved up the road, to be introduced
to by far the worst feature of the trip, the hill
to the summit, which of course had to be
walked, some six miles. It was extremely hot,
with not a breath of air to temper the fierce
heat that beat down upon them. Their cona
tion can better be imagined than descrit^a
They reached the summit more dead than
alive at 2:30 P. m., having consumed three
long hours in walking th* six miles. This
part of the journey will long be remembered
by the boys as the hardest bit of cycling known
in their erperience.
After a half hour's stop at the summit they
again took to the road, which waÂ» the be
ginning of a thirty-mile down-grade ride to
Santa Cruz. After every one had tied a piece
of shrubbery to a rope attached to his wheel to
serve as a drag, they begnn moving down the
grade, being about 200 yards .apart, so as to
avoid the dust made by the man in front. The
roads in this section of the mountains were all
that could be desired and the scenery was
grand. It was a few minutes after 6 o'clock
when they passed Boulder Creek bound for
Santa-Cruz, fourteen miles away, which was
covered in a little over an hour, they finishing
the eighty-seven mile trip at 7:30 p.m., fifteen
hours after starting.
It is needles* to say that they all enjoyed the
journey, excepting that hill, and slep: scmndly
that night. Sunday morning a trip was made
to Capiiola, where a swim in the breakers was
in order. After dinner they returned to Sauta
Cruz for home. The members say that except
ing the six-mile hill from Congress Springs to
the summit, the ride cannot be excelled for
fine scenery and good roads.
The next meeting of the California As
sociated Cycling Clubs will be held Satur
day evening;, August 1.
Captain Pixley will take the members of
the San Francisco Road Club to San
Leandro to-morrow to witness the 20-mile
road race.
The Western Wheelman, a local weekly
cycling paper, has suspended publication
owing to lack of patronage from adver
tisers.
The proposed indoor race meet to be
held at Sacramento the latter part of this
month is attracting the attention of the
riders of this City and across the bay. and
many of them will go th-re to compete.
The races will be held in the new pavilion
at Fifteenth n:ui N streets. Entry blanks

Captain Black has called a ran of the
Golden Gate Cycling Club for to-morrow
to Hay wards, takine the 8:30 A. M. boat
and stopping at San Leandro to see tne
road race. At the last meeting E. A. Kirk-
Patrick was elected to membership and
several other applications were received.
C. Unfred oi the Golden Gates has re
turned from his trip to San Luis Obispo
and reports the roads in that county in
fair condition. P. J. Hyde, secretary of
this club is working on a new proposition,
which if successful will be an innovation
in the good-roads movement.
The Cycle Board of Trade will meet next
Wednesday evening, July 15, at the Ramb
ler Biclorama, Tenth and Market streets,
to further discuss the proposed bie street
parade of wheelmen on Saturday evening,
July 25. The various City clubs "have been
invited to send delegates to the meeting,
it being suggested that the captain of each
club attend. It may be news to the Board
of Trade, but I have canvassed several of
the big clubs and find it is a fact that they
are not wholly in sympathy with the
movement to have a big wheelmen's pa
rade.
The individual riders themselves do not
like to parade, at least the majority do not.
It is hard work to ride in line slowly over
rough streets and cobbles, which have,
perhaps, been sprinkled, with the possi
bility of some small boy thrusting a stick
through your wheel any minute. Again,
the big clubs and the Board of Trade are
not so thoroughly in touch since the re
fusal of the latter to stand in and help the
ciubs. support tUe Central Park track.
"WÂ« wanted their Help then and they
refused it ; now let them whistle for ours,"
was the way one gentleman, the president
of a club, put It. Evidently his club will
not turn out. If any of the Bay City
Wheelmen turn out, either, it will be a
surprise to me. I have talked with over
half of them on the subject; the mere
mention of a cycle parade is abhorrent to
them ; they never did and never will
parade, except for their president, Frank
H. Kerrigan, in politicul times.
But this is only the dark side of it. It
must not be thought by the wheelmen or
the c'.ubs that they would be doinjr the
Cycle Board of Trade any more good than
they would themselves by helping to
make this parade a big success. Improved
streets and the lighting ol the park will no
doubt aid fn the sale of more wheels, but
what a great boon they will also be to the
riders themselves. . If this parade is to be
held at all, let us make it a big success. It
would be a mistake for the wheelmen to
turn out few in number and half
heartedly. lam of the opinion that just
about this time a representative wheel
men's parade would do a world of good in
showing to the people the number and
i strength of the bicycle's devotees. Now,
if the captains of the big local clubs will
each take a personal interest in the mat
ter and work it up among their members,
no doubt the greater portion of them will
turn out this time, and they certainly owe
it to themselves to do so. Let the various
captains attend that meeting next
Wednesday night and become enthused
on the desirability of the project, as I
have.
The League of American Wheelmen in
North California now numbers just 1500,

THE ANGLERS.
Bass Fishing: tn Russian Riverâ
Spooning for Salmon In Mon
terey Bay.
Angleres who are anxious to enjoy a few
days' good bassfishing should repair to
Guerneville, which is situated on the line
of the San Francisco and North Pacific
Railroad, and cast their lines in
the deep pools of Russian River.
Several fine bass have been taken
from river recently by anglers who used
live minnows. Some eood results were
also had from grasshoppers and large
angle-worms. The evening fishing is said
to be the best at the present time.
Justices Carroll and Groezinger are
meeting with grand success at Lake Inde

tice Carroll writes that flyfishing is excel
lent The trout he sent to his brother in
this City arrived in very poor condition.
Theodore Allison and Fred Go bey are
enjoying tirst-class trout fishing at Lake
Tahoe.
James Stan ton, father of the Railroad
Commissioner, shipped a splendid creel of
rainbow trout last Monday to Ed Ladd,
the gun merchant, from Tahoe.
Mr. Mullin, a well-known insurance
manager, Ed Greenway of the Four Hun
dred, ex-Sheriff Laumeister and Samuel
Daniels of the Bank of California, had
great sport last week catching salmon in
Monterey Bay.
Nothing has been heard of Alfonso Cnm
ming, the champion fly-caster of Fruit
vale, Alameda County, since his depart
ure for Dormer and Webber lakes. The
friendd of the Highlander are anxiously
waiting for some of those delicious trout
that the angler promised prior to his de
parture for parts unknown.
T. H. Curley, the forgetful angler,
Charles Green, Chris Moorehouse and Billy
Jones left this City last Wednesday to
prospect for bass in Russian River. The
party had as luggage fourteen bottles of
adulterated water, one barrel of condensed
milk and a loaf and a half of bread. It is
hardly necessary to remark that they pro
pose having a good time regardless of bass,
wind or weather. They will return to
morrow evening if nothing unforseen
happens to prolong their Btay on the
Russian. * .
Professor Horatio Terry of the Ban
Francisco Rod and Gun Club returned
from Ten-mile River, near Fort Bragg,
last Monday. The professor states that
camping parties can be seen along the
banks of the river for miles and that the
trout are consequently shy and wary.
Frank Marcus and "John Butler are at
the present time "spooning" for salmon
In Monterey Bay. A friend of the anglers
wrote to John Lemmer yesterday to the
effect that the whales and sharks have
taken their departure forother parts. The
leviathans of the deep were evidently
alarmed at seeing the irnpliments of
torture which Marcus and Butler used for
the capture of salmon. The writer states
that the spoons the anglers used in troll
ing resembled, in a measure, the blades of
a warship's propeller, and the recent de
crease in the numbers of salmon and other
fishes in the bay is attributed to the sud
den scare they received on seeing this
new and desperate device for their cap
ture.

ATHLETIC
How Tallent, the Great Mller of
the Northwest, Jumped Into
Fame.
Captain Gill oi the Olympic Club will,
like many other members of the team
which recently invaded Portland, be a bit
surprised to learn that Tallent, the cham
pion long-distance runner of the North
west, is a single man, 23 years of age, and
not 38 years, as erroneously reported. The
following letter from Robert Gibson of
Astoria, Or., concerning Tallent will be
read with much interest by local athletes.
Gibson was at one time a prominent mem
ber of t .c Olympic Club, who had a strong
predilection for outdoor athletics. The
letter reads:
Sporting Editor Call: Tallent's ascent of the
lf.dder of athletic fame has been riipid. and
the only reason why it was not accomphKbed
at a single bound was because he was not
called upon to show his iull powers. Tho de
velopment of the muscles, which have carried
him to victory on the cinder path, wns begun
on the football field four years ago, previous
to which time he bad shown no indications of
eithei speed or endurance. Since boyhood he
has been an ardent admirer of boxing, which,
with rowing and hunting, formed his chief
sources of outdoor amusement and exercise for
a number of years.
In 1891, when association football was intro
duced in Astoria by the football club. Tallent
was quickly interested and seldom missed a
practice game for two or three yexrs. Being
an enthusiast and popular in 1892 he was
elected captain of the learn, and w title never
a brilliant player displayed such remarkable
staying powers that he attracted the attention
of older athletes, who predicted a brilliant
future for him. He made his first appearance
in running clothes on July 4, 1894, partici
pating in several events on a field day given
by the Astoria Football Club. He only suc
ceeded on that occasion in capturing second
place in a 220-yard nurdle race. A few weeks
later tie again competed in indoor games held

;. A marked improvement was noted In his
gait then, and then he was induced soon after
ward to train for the Multnomah Club's
games in 1894. His hollow victory in both the
distance events then and the consummate ease
with which he romped away from his oppo
nents caused many spectators of the games to
express the opinion that the Astorian was a
"ringer," and- the handicappcr, who allowed
Tallent sixty yards in the half and a like dis
tance in the mile, fell in for a generous meas
ure of criticism. Tallent was well -known,
however, by many members of the Multnoman
Club, all of whom vouched for the fact that he
was only a novice. *â¢ -.. â¢ r *
His only defeat â : was at Tacoma last year
when John Button, probably the best middle
distance man that ever donned a shoe in Cali
fornia, took him over the first 440 yards of the
hall-mile race in 57 seconds and left : him to
"fight it out" : with ' two Tacomans, ' one of
whom succeeded in beating Tallant out for
first place. The former Berkeley man had en
tered the race solely as "runner-up" for a
clubmate and the Astorian's condition was not
such as to enable him to successfully cope
with fresh men after negotiating a mile in
, 4 :40. His later victories are still fresh In the
minds of all coast athletes. R. Gibson.
It can be safely said that the' Olympic
Club of this City, will offer tempting in
ducements to the Multnoniah Club to send
a team of athletes to ; this City in Septem
ber to meet the champions of the Olympic
Club in a series of 'outdoor games. .

THE GUN.
Sportsmen Must Be Careful Where
They Shoot Deer and Doves.
The trap-shooters are now enjoyine a
ereat feast of prosperity, so to speak. Each
Sunday several club shoots are held at
different points within easy reach of this
City, and, judging from the enthusiasm
manifested, it would appear that inani
mate-target shooting has come to stay.
The Reliance, Olympic, Empire and En
cinal gun clubs will bold contests to-mor
row at their respective shooting grounds
in Alameda.
TvÂ« Sportsmen's Protective Association
will meet to-morrow at the grounds of the
Soutn End Gun Club, near Colma. The
club has offered a number of valuable
prizes to be contested tor and a first-class
day's outing is promised aii those who
will attend. A series of pool-shooting
events will taire place immediately follow
ing the association's shoot. The San
Francisco and San Mateo Electric Kail
way will take sportsmen direct to the
grounds.
On the 18th inst. the Alameda Sports
men's Association will meet at Alameda
Point, and on the 19th inst. the Lincoln
Club will shoot on its own grounds. The
California Wing Club will endeavor to
hold a live-bird shoot at San Bruno after
having two postponement*.
Reports from the interior stated that
doves are stiil nesting, and many sports
men have refrained from shooting at them
until next month. Jud^e McKenna and
a friend returned a few days ago dis
gusted, because they found nearly all old
birds which were then caring for their
young. After shooting some birds they
put up their guns with a resolution to re
irain from any further dove-shooting un
til the young birds are able to look out for
themselves. How many sportsmen can
there be found among the fraternity, who
go into the fields in quest of doves, who
will emulate the act of Judge McKenna?
Under the provisions of the general law
the dove season opened on July 1 (a month
too early) and will close on February 15.
Sportsmen should not forget that the Su
pervisors have the power to shorten the
season, and this has been clone in some of
the counties. The deer season, under the
general law, has been changed by ordi
nances in several counties of the State, as

THE. OARSMEN.
Stockton and San Francisco Fight
ing for the Annual Regatta.
Considerable dissatisfaction is prevalen t
among the rowing fraternity at present
relative to making the regatta to be held
at Stockton during the Native Bons' cele
bration on November 9 a championship
affair.
The Btockton Athletic Association ap
plied for a sanction for the regatta over
two months ago and asked to have the
affair made a championship event, but the
P. A. A. anticipate a big regatta on the
bay here during fiesta week, and as Stock
ton has had two regattas this year efforts
are going to be brought to bear to have the
rhumpionship races alloted to this City
during the carnival.
S. J; Pembroke of the Alameda Boating
and Swimming Club was present at one of
the meetings of the Chamber of Com
merce held recently and pointed out to
them the advisability of setting aside an
appropriate sum for a fiesta regatta, and
his efforts received commendable consid
eration. He now feels certain that a re
gatta will be part of the athletic pro
gramme of the carnival.
In the event that the 9th of September
regatta will not be a championship affair
it will undoubtedly be one of the greatest
aquatic events ever held 011 this coast,
The clubs are fast developing new mate
rial, and many new crews that have never
before been seen in a race will take part iv
the Admission-day regatta. This will be
a grain of comfort to the spectators, for it
has long been a pr-vailing feature of re
gattas that the same men are always tak
ing part and the same men always win
ning and losing.
At the Stockton regatta on July 4 several
new men participated in the races, and as
a consequence some of the old-timers were
ignominiouslv defeated. George Pbelan,
the latest addition to the rowing world,
will certainly mnke his rowing prowess
known in all future regattas. He won the
junior outrigger-skiff race at the Stockton
regatta so handily that he is already
looked upon as the coming coast cham
pion.
I'helan was the only one out of the Oriel
Club's many entries in the Stockton races
who brought victory to his club.
The Stockton people feel rather sore over
the defeat of their new barge in its first
race, but the barge, in the opinion of
many, is not what it is cracked up to be,
and if anything the Stockton crew that
rowed it on the Fourth were the equal in
every particular of the South End crew
that defeated them. It can be, therefore,
seen that the contest was an equal test of
home production against Eastern manu
facture and home production came out on
top.
The barge is altogether dissimilar to the
home boats. It is shorter sits lower in the
water and the eunwaie is perfectly
straight. The bottom of the boat resembles
a wedge. The stern is drawn in almost to
a point, the bow is rather fall and the stem
comes straight down until it reaches the
water, when it begins to taper off grad
ually. In the home barges the stem
begins to taper off from the gunwale and
resembles a yacfct with cutaway bows, but
the stem of the Stockton boat is almost
straight.
The boat is not by any means a hand
some craft. The workmanship is very
plain, and the knowing onea say she will
do all right for the placid waters of the
Stockton slougb, but woe betide her when
she reaches the rough waters of the bay.
The South End junior crew, which de
feated the Stocktonian oarsmen, is cer
tainly deserving of great credit. After
passing a sleepless night before the race,
owing to lack of accommodations on the
steamers, the boys won from the StocKton
crew after one of the .earnest races ever
rowed on the coast. Tbe Stockton crew
led them from the start and at the stake
were two lengths ahead, but tneir new boat
couldn't turn as fast as the South End
barge, and before the Stockton boat was
half around the staie :he Soutn End boys
were well on their way home, rowing a
beautiful stroke.
To-morrow at 10 o'clock on the Alameda
estuary the losers of last Sunday's regatta
will meet for a medal donated by s. J.
Pembroke; the jeweler.
Dr. Dennis and Fred Avers will meet
again and Hadcock and Webb will meet
to settle first and second place. A barge
race for a silver cup will also take place.
All the rooms of the Olympic Club boat
house arenow being occupied by members,
who are making it their residence for the
summer. Kodgers, the boat-builder, Gas
completed their four-oare shell and a
crew will soon be put into practice, as it is
the club's intention to take abvantage of
the low rate to Portland and the Sound
cities and enter a crew in some of the
regattas.
They would like to see some of the other
local clubs tafce to shell racing, as barges
are not recognized in the East, and if aliell
rowing was encouraged here California
may be in a position to send a crew East
every year.
McElroy intends to get the Olympic
crew in practice again for the Admission
day regatta. It will be the same crew that
rowed at El Campo on May 30.
THE BOXERS.
National Club in a Quandary, Occl-
.dental Club Happy.
The National Athletic Club received a
smash on the vulnerable point yesterday
from the Board of Supervisors which
stunned it badly. It applied, as of old, for
a permit to give an athletic exhibition in
August, but Supervisor King winked at
his friend Benjamin, who ixx turn winked
at Dunker who jumped to the center of
the ring, and with one mighty bound ac
administered an upper-cut which com
pletely floored the National Club.
It was a quick and spirited contest, which
lasted only one round. It is hardly neces
sary to say that the managers of the club
expected to meet sucli an able opponent in
Dunker, who was selected to put on the
finishing touches. Although the club has
not yet fully recovered from the effects of
the blow, another effort will be made to
bring about a return match, and it goes
without saying that it will be in better
condition for a hard and successful fight
the next time it faces the mighty muscles
of the City Fathers.
Joe King says tnat he will train for the
struggle at his old favorite resort, Gold
Mountain. Dunker will, in all probability,
put on ihe finishing touches in Silver Can
yon. Benjamia is uncertain as to the
place he will select for a training station,
but his iriends of the board hint that Ben
will unfold his tent, like the Arab, and nic
away under cover ol night to a favorite
resort which is known only to himself and
a certain coterie of friends.
It is safe to say, however, that he will
return in magnificent condition to meet a
hard battle if nis opponent proves worthy
of his steel.
The Occidental Club is on Easy street at
present. The Supervisors have taken pity
on it owing to its first exhibition, which,
unfortunately, terminated unfavorably.
A permit will be granted to the Occidental
managers to give an exhibition in August,
and in all probability Young Mitchefl. its
president, will negotiate for a ten-round
contest between Maher and Choynski.
The Olympic Club is figuring on giving
an entertainment on the evening of the
31st inst. The star attraction will be a
10-round contest between Jeffries of Los
Angeles and Van Buskirk of the Olympic
Club; that is, it those fighters can be in
duced to box for a reasonable considera
tion. Members will be charged an admis
sion on this occasion.
Tne Manhattan Athletic Club of this
City will hold a tournament at its club
rooms on Tuesday eveninu, August 11,
during which the feather-weight cham
pionship of the coast will be decided.
Secretary Gallagher states that the first
prize will be $100 and second prize $50,
which considerations are not in conso
nance with the rules of the Amateur Ath
letic Union. Entrees for the tournament
will close on the evening of August 4.

Westminster, Orange Co., May 18, 1896.
Dr. A. T. Sanden â Dear Sir: The Belt which
I bought from you some time ago has cured.
me. My disease was seminal weakness of five
years' standing. ' I had emissions on an aver-
age of five times a week, and many times' three
In one night. I used â  all kinds of drugs and
patent medicines, and was, when I began your
treatment, in a very weak condition, both
from my trouble and the many different drugs
I had taken. As soon as I applied your Belt I â 
found relief from my losses, in three , weeks a
general improved condition, and I am now en-
tirely cured.. I cannot say 100 much in praise
of your Beit. Yours truly, J. M. HUBBARD.
No man can attain physical or muscular
perfection while there is any want of vital
force. It is the grit, the vim, the "ginger"
which supports the powers of endurance,
and the command of latent physical
strength.
. Every â  man â  knows himself. He knows
where he is weak. Knowing it, if he is
true to himself, he will try to recover the
vital power he has waste!.
The source of all physical power is in
the nerves. The life of the nerves is elec-
tricity. â  So says science. Man, if you lack
any of the elements of manhood, will you
barter your future happiness any furtba?
by letting this chance pass? Be one â¢-.!

hood, physically, sexually, mentally.
: "A great change has come over me, and I
feel better than I ever did. I feel in such good
health that I cut about a cord- of wood a day
and don't feel tired at night." So writes Mr.
JOHN W. PHILLIPS, Coif ax, Cal., June 29.
A steady, even flow of electricity into your '
body for several li ours at night will bring
new life to the nerves, and from them to
the whole body. The brain will be re-
freshed, the i nerves ; strong, quick and ac-

expand and develop in force and vitality.
It ' will, in : three ! months, renew perfect
manly vigor in every part. It is as good
for women as for men. :

LECTURES ON ANARCHY
Henry Addis of Portland Continue!
the Work of Pietro Gori.
Henry Addis of Portland, Or., lectured
Thursday night under the auspices of the
local anarchists' club, at Powell and Union
streets, to a large audience. He intends to
carry on the work begun here by Pietro
Gori, the celebrated Italian anarchist.
"Tbe socialists," said he, "have been
casing for an opponent and mv friends
brought me down here to accommodate
them. Now that lam here they refuse to
debate with me. They tell me they want
to debate with persons of reputation,
and they don't know me. I met Laurence
Gronlund in Tacoma in debate and de
cidedly carried the crowd with me."
Addis is known through the Firebrand
of Portland as a writer on anarchy. Ar
rangements are to be made for a series of
lectures, and he intends to speak on "The
Value of Proposed Reforms," "Is Social
Revolution Inevitable," "Mission of Trade
Unionism," "Industrial Reconstruction"
and "Social Reconstruction."

Them.

E. P. Ferry is seeking the aid of Judge
Campbell's court to recover a large amount
of furniture which John W. Flinn seized
Judge Campbell and S. Jacobson. Dealer in General Merchandise, but Willing to
Enter Into Any Business in Which There Is Anything for Himself.
upon authority of a chattel mortgage exe
cuted by Mrs. Ferry to S. Jacobson, devel
oped a marked resemblance to farce
comedy yesterday afternoon.
Mrs. Ferry, who was to have been put
through a cross-examination by Attorney
Robert H. Countryman for the defendant,
was reluctantly excused for the time being
after Dr. E. J. Fraser had testified that
she was suffering from heart trouble and
the lady herself had taken the stand and
gaaped painfully at every question asked.
Jacobson was then put on the stand. Mr.
Jacobson was an unwilling witness for the
people, but he was a more than williug
talker. Every question of Attorney Me-
Gowan called forth a flood of garrulity
from the old man which neither Jndge
nor stenographer could begin to follow.
"You talk like an alarm clock,'.' ex
claimed his Honor in despair. "Go a lit
tle slow and see if we can find out what
you are talking about."
By dint of patient questioning it was as
certained that Jacobson resided at 511 Van
Ness avenue and did a merchandise busi
ness at 120 Kearny street. He denied that
be was a money broker, but admitted
"any Kind of business comes along I tend
to it if there ia something in it for me."
He told of having loaned Mrs. Ferry $1000
with interest at 3 per cent, taking a chat
tel mortgage upon* her furniture. Asked
as the particulars of the instrument exe
cuted Jacobson replied excitedly, "How
should I know. I have honest business on
my mind."
"Tnis is not honest business then?"
asked McGowan.
"No, sir," exclaimed the money- lender,
excitedly.
Judge Campbell saw the old man's vol
ubility was getting the best of him and
called a halt in the proceedings until he
had explained McGowan's question to
the witness.
Jacobson then said he didn't mean to
call the transaction dishonest.
"Where is that note now?" asked Mc-
Gowan.
"I have got them. I cwn the note yet."
Jacobson said he had received $30 interest
from Mrs. Ferry. At first he declared that
was all he had received on account of the
note, but afterward admitted he had re
ceived $30 more through Flinn.
"I went to see her twice," he said, "and I
she would not see me. She gave me a
square answer. She said 'Go!' like that.
I would never go there any more." Ja
cobson then recounted how he went to
Flinn and reproached him for sending
him such a bad client as Mrs. Ferry had
proved. Flinn told him if Mrs. Ferry
didn't pay him be would.
"Did you instruct Flinn to take the fur
niture from the house?" asked Judge
Qampbell.
"No; 1 didn't know he was going to do
it, but I had a suspicion," was the answer.
"Does Flinn owe you anythine?" asked
the Judge.
"Yes; $1000," was the reply.
"Does Mrs. Ferry owe you anything?"
Jacobeon saw he was centered. He saw
that if Flinn owed him the money he
must relinquish hi* lien upon the furni
ture, while if Mrs. Ferry owed it to him
Flinn would have no justification for
seizing the property. The witness tried in
vain to evade the issue, but Judge Camp
bell and Attorney McGowan stayed at
him mercilessly. At last be said be was
looking to both or either of them. All he
wanted waa his money.
Theodore Kytka, an artist, told of the
circumstances of the signing by Jlrs. Ferry
of an alleged bill of sale to Flinn. He
said he was sitting back smoking a cigar
when Flinn called, and be took only "an
"artistic interest" in the proceedings. His
testimony was to the effect that it was
dark and Flinn had represented to Mrs.
Ferry that she was signing a receipt. He
also testified to the raid made upon the
house by FJinrf and his men, when all the
furniture was removed.
The ease was continued until Monday
at 2 p. M. to allow Mrs. Ferry to recover
sufficiently to be cross-examined. Judge
Campbell instructed the attorneys that be
was getting tired of this case, which was
civil in its nature. "I am paid for battery, I

disturbing the peace and vulgar language." i
he said, "i don't want any civil business.''
He intimated very strongly that from
Jacobson's testimony it looked to him as if
Flinn bad no right to touch Mrs. Ferry's I
goods.
THE SOCIALISTS' IDEA.
Oliver Everett Speak* Upon Labor
Unions aud Party Politics.
There was a large attendance at Thurs
day night's meeting of the Jewish Branch
of the Socialist Labor party at its head
quarters, 970 Folsom street. The address
of the evening was by Oliver Everett, who
was introduced by William Lewis, the
chairman of the meeting. After speaking
on the economic advantages offered to the
wageworkers by trades associations in the
past, Mr. Everett said that the distress
universal to-day throughout the country
has already resulted in a variety of reme
dies, including the McKinley protection
plaster, tbe .Democratic free trade and
tree silver coinage remedy, and the Popu
lists are already promising to imitate
both old party tactics with its free-coinage
plank in the vain hope of decoying the
labor vote or stampeding the rural vote
into its camp.
The Socialist Labor party has no need
to have recourse to any such political
gerrymandering or bunco-steering tactics
to gain a following. It promises no illu- -
sory dreams of ease and wealth to those
who adopt its party platform. Broadly
aiming at the destruction of the wage sys
tem, and pledged to the collective owner
ship of all the opportunities of life,
viz,, the means of production and
distribution, it appeals with confidence to
all classes of society, and with more par
ticular stress to the toiling millions bend
ing beneath the weight of poverty and
oppression to unite under the banner of
socialism, promising in return for their
solidarity equitable enjoyment and par
ticipation In all the bounties of Mother
Nature's larder.
It is the duty, continued Mr. Evereti, of
every humanitarian to support the princi
ples of the Socialist Labor party as the
only ones conducive to the needs of civ
ilization.
Short speeches followed by William
Lewis, William Edhn, Mark LeitÂ°s E T

SECURE FOREIGN TRADE.
San Francisco Merchants Look
ing for More Business
With Japan.
The Chamber of Commerce May Send
a Man to Solicit Trade Across
the Pacific.
Much importance is attached to the pro
ject now being considered by the Chamber
of Commerce to send a representative from
the Pacific Coast merchants to Japan for
the purpose of soliciting foreign trade and
broadening the commercial interests of
California, particularly of San Francisco.
It is the purpose of the merchants' organ
ization to send a representative man to
Japan first as an experiment, and if the
results of his labors there in stimulating
trade are sufficiently encouraging other
representatives will be sent by the Cham
ber of Commerce to other seaport conn- ' l
tries, such as Peru, Chile, Brazil, the
Sandwich Islands and the countries of
Central America.
San Francisco has taken the initiative in
the matter of seeking for more foreign
trade, and the project is being commended
on all sides with a strong tide in favor of
the dispatching of a competent man in the
near future.
The matter was to have come up for dis
cussion yesterday afternoon at the meeting
of the Chamber of Commerce, but as the
delegation from the Board of Traae did
not materialize the session was postponed
until next Wednesday afternoon at the
Board of Trade rooms.
The wholesale importing merchants of
6an Francisco and the owners of steam
ships and sailing vessels hive been com
plaining for some time past of the laxity
of the foreign trade, and it is believed that
soliciting among the merchant , abroad
and stirring them up will improve the con
dition of affairs. Many vessels are now
lying ;n tat harbor waiting for charters
while others which are doing duty have
not paid their own insurance premiums in
the past tnree years, according to the
statements of thcr owners.
As there is at present no fund in the
hands of the Chamber of Commerce for
defraying the expense of sending a man to
Japan thi amount will be made up by in
dividual subscriptions from the various
merchants interested. At present there
are ten or twelve names under considera
tion, and it is expected that both the ques
tions of sending a man and who shall be
sent will be decided at the meeting on
Wednesday. 6

LAID IN WAIT
FOR HUNTINGTON.
Sensational Action of an
Ex-Employe of the
Railroad.
THREATS AND DEMANDS
A. J. Collins Declared Hs Would
Risk His Life to Secure
Justice.
CAPTAIN LEES TO THE RESCUE.
The Man Who Demanded $25,000 for
Alleged Wrongs Allowed to
Roam at Large.
It is many a long day since the railroad
building on the corner of Market and
Montgomery streets was the scene of so
much suppressed excitement and mental
uneasiness as yesterday.
It arose from the visit of A. J. Collins,
an ex-employe of the Southern Pacific
Company, who came with implied threats
against the life of Vice-President H. E.
Huntington and extraordinary demands
against the corporation.
' Collins was formerly engaged in the Los
Angeles yards of the company, and had
one of his feet badly mancrled in an acci
dent while at worfc. Subsequently he wa3
discharged from the employ of the com
pany. This, he alleges, was without just
cause and to get rid of him. Since that
time, he declares, he has been persecuted
by the company to such an extent that he
has become absolutely destitute.
Last fall he created consternation on the
fourth floor of the Union Trust Company's
building, wherein are the offices of the
Southern Pacific Company, by making an
assault on Manager J. A. Fillmore, but
without serious results. He has now di
rected his attention to H. E. Huntington.
and oi late has made persistent though
unobtrusive efforts to secure a personal
interview with the nephew oi Collis P.
Huntington. He called at the railroad
offices on Wednesday, but Mr. Hunting
ton was out. He waited around, evidently
for tne purpose of intercepting the object
of his search should he enter the building,
but became wearied and departed.
Collins called again yesterday morning,
waited in the ante-room connected with
the private office of H. E. Huntington for
about two hours and then left for lunch.
He returned about 2 o'clock and, finding
that the man he sought was out, de
scended in the elevator to the lobby which
opens on Montgomery street. He had not
long to wait this time, for soon Mr. Hunt
ington, accompanied by Chief Engineer
Hood, entered and beaded for the ele
vator. Collins followed a few feet behind
them, intending, undoubtedly, to secure
an interview with Huntington in h^ pri
vate office. When the elevator came
down Bert Wortnington, Huntington's
private secretary, stepped out and, recog
nizing Collins and apprehensive that
trouble might ensue, he stepped in front
of Collins and engaged him in conversa
tion, thus allowing his chief to ascend to
his office.
Worthington left the building on an er
rand for a few moments and when he re
turned to tbe fifth floor found Collins in
the anteroom waiting to see Huntington.
He at once telephoned for Captain Lees,
and then engaged Collins again in conver
sation. The latter poured out his griev
ances at length and in detail, and wound
up by saying that he came not with any
intention of doing any one harm, but
to secure justice for the wrongs he had
been made to suffer from the persecution
of the railroad company. He added that
in order to secure this reparation he would
not hesitate to risk his life.
W'lion asked what he desired he replied
that he wanted $25,000. He was offered
employment, but said he did not care to
go to work for the company again.
Meanwhile Captain Lees arrived and
was ushered unseen by Collins into the
sanctum occupied by Collis P. Huntington
when he deigns to visit this City. This
office immediately adjoins that of the
nephew. Cullius was brought into tbe
' presence of Lees, and after telling his
1 troubles to tbe policeman deemed it best
I to depart, which he was allowed to do.
No attempt was madeto search him or
to arrest him. The railroad people are in
clined to look upon Collins as possessing
a deranged mind, but Captain Lees'
! opinion is that the man is perfectly sane
I and that he is simply playing a coarse
! game of blackmail.
While Collins was kicking his heels in
the ante-room he niade no secret of the
purpose of his visit and occasioned con
siderable perturbatiou iv the minds of
[ many of the office attaches. H. E. Hunt
ington, however, showed no signs of un
easiness, and when asKed about the sensa
tional incident and the bold^intruder said
he knew the man, but had not seen or
spo&en to him for at least two years and
did not know on what grounds* he based
his extraordinary demands.
MARRIED A GAY DRUMMER.
Mm. Mary K. Mi.Quiddy la Xow Seek
ing a Separation.
Mary E. McQuiddy appeared in Judge
Slack's court yesterday in a suit for main
tenance. She has applied for a divorce
from her husband, Redding McQuiudy,
and the case is pending in Judge Troutt's
court. Redding McQuiddy is a traveling
salesman employed by Reddington <fc Co.,
the wholesale druggists. He is in receipt
of a salary of $125 per month, and also re
ceives a commission on goods sold.
Mrs. McQuiddy says her husband is a
bold, bad man, bolder than and fully as
bad as the gayest young blood on the
road.
According to her own testimony, Mrs.
McQuiddy is herself no angel. She con
fesses to having taken treatment at the
Keeley Institute in Los Gatos, but con
tends that she only did it to please her
husband, und in t because she was accus
tomed to over-indulgence in alcoholic
stimulants- Nevertheless, she is quite an
authority on the drink question, in tell
ing of a time when she watched outside a
door in the Grand Hotel, her husband,
another man and a woman being locked
behind it, she said she counted twentv
eight drinks that were carried in.
The husband's attorney, among other
questions, asked Mrs. McQuiddy if it was
no' true that the reason her husband de
prived her of money was because she
could not be trusted with it. He claimed
that she spent all her coin for liquor.
This the witness denied, and asserted that
recently she had been in actual want for
food, and on one occasion fainted by rea
son of weakness caused by lack of nourish
ment.
Mrs. McQniddy denied that her hus
band ever found empty whisjey bottles in
her room in San Jose, and branded as a
falsehood the statement that she went out
on the streets of Hanford, clad in a single
garment, in quest of liquor. She also said
she never drank cologne when she could

The fair plaintiff has an aunt who is
matron of a hospital in Hollister, and Mr.
McQuiddy wanted her to live with her
relative. She refused to do this because
the hospital is also an almshouse and be
cause she does not appreciate such sur
roundings.
Judge Slack allowed the complainant
$10 per week alimony pending the hearing
of the trial.
OFFICIAL KITE-FLYING,
Weather Prophet Haramon Meets With
Success in His Experiment*.
Weather Prophet Hammon still con
tinues his kite-flying experiments with
gratifying results. At present all of the
observations by the Weather Bureau are
made from the surface, or at best from the
tops of I lgh buildings and hills.
Scientific men, however, have invented
delicately constructed instruments by
wlnc!i the humidity, temperature, wind
velocity, etc., can be determined at eleva
tions above the influence of the conditions
at the surface of the ground.
The difficulty has been to get such an in
strument at the required elevation without
the aid of a balloon.
The difficulty has been overcome by the
flyers of kites, and when this feat 13
brought to something liko perfection the
little register, which weighs about two
pounds, wi'l be sent into the sky on the
tail of a kite.
The attempt of Mr. Hammon to send
up several kites from the top of the Twin
Peaks last Saturday was not a success, as
the wind blew such a gale at that point
that it tore five of hia eight large kites to
pieces.
On Wednesday he made another and
more successful attempt in' this direction
at tbe park. He used piano wire, two
pounds to the mile, and sent one kite up
1600 feet on half a mile of wire.
A second kite was fastened on, tandem
fashion, and the first kite reached an alti
tude of 2700 feet on a mile of wire. The
lifting power proved satisfactory.
After a few more trials Mr. Hammon
will send up the little instrument to help
him in forecasting the weather.
GIVES HERSELF THE LIE,
Alma E. Josselyn Retracts Her
Charges Against George
Staacke.
Dr. Marten Says She Must 83 Insane
or Influenced by Designing
Persons.
A new phase of the Dr. Marten- Alma
Josselyn case oame to light yesterday.
Some time ago Miss Josselyn sued |
George Standee for $50,000 damages for al- j
leged seduction. Staacke is her grand- !
father â that is, Alma Josselyn's father is
the adopted son of Staacke's wife. ; The
young woman declared in her complaint |
that when she first came to live in the
Staacke home, being then less than 12
years of age, her grandfather by threats
and force accomplished her ruin and that
their illicit relations extended over * a
period of several 'years.
Yesterday General "W. H. L. Barnes,
who was /Miss.- Jo&ielyn's attorney, tiled a
paper asking that the case be dismissed.
Attached to the : request was the following
letter from his client:
San Francisco, July 9, 1896.
. General If*. H. L. Barnesâ Dear" Sib: . I re
ceived your message this morning through D.
A. Ryan.- In regard to the suit that was filed I
against my grandfather, George Staacke, I beg 'â 
to say that what the affidavit contained was j
false, every word of it, and I was compelled by !
Dr. . Arthur Marten to swear to it under j
threats . of : death; < not only this affidavit, but
many other documents ; . and â  under the v
cumstances I beg of you to dismiss the case I
against Mr.rStaaCke, as no such a thing ever'
happened, and I hope â  and trust - that :, Dr.
Marten, may be placed where he belongs.
Very respectfully, -.s Alma E. Josselyk.
When Dr. Marten, who is still confined
in the ' City Prison, was . told of the
woman's statement be became . greatly
excited and exclaimed, "She >is crazy ;
completely out of her head in consequence
of her physical condition. When her trou
bles are over she will tell the truth about
all these affairs."
When asked if he had compelled or even
advised her to -begin the damage suit
against George Staacke be said :
*;*'Tobe sure I knew about it, but I did
not advise* her to do as she did in this
matter.; What I did , tell her was that if
she began such an action I, as her hus
band, would stand by her and uphold her
honor.. She has fallen into the hands of
shaiks, who by the use of money. are mak
ine her say anything that pleases them.
When her mind clears up she will tell the
truth, I am sure.""

HEALTH IS A BIRTHRIGHT TO MAN!
Almost One-Half of the People That Are Born Into
This World Have Lost This Birthright Through
the Errors of Parents or Ancestors.
HOW TO REMEDY THE WRONG
Through the transgressions and disre- I
gard of the physical laws which govern !
the human system one-half of the people
born into the world commence their exist-
ence hereditary wrecks, with feeble con-
stitutions, and a lack of that vitality
which is necessary to make life a success.
This class of sufferers are not responsible |
for b ing born in this deplorable condition,
but they are simply paying the penalties
for the errors committed by parents nr an-
cestors against our physical laws. "While
they are not to blame for the condition in
which they come into the world, yet if
they neglect to remedy the wrong when
the means of relief is within their reach
then they are not only responsible for
their own weakness but for the untold
misery and suffering of their posterity.
The other half of the people who are
horn into the world come into it with per-
fect health and this greatest of all bless-
ings they retain just as long as they obey
the laws of nature. Disease to them is a
violation of these laws and nearly all are
transgressors. For such transgressions
we receive our punishment, and the

A LICENSE WAS REFUSED
The National Club Will Not
Hold the Maher-Choynski
Fight.
Supervisors Declare in Favor of a
More Eqnal Division of
Licenses.
Unless the Health and Police Committee
of the Board of Supervisors changes its
mind speedily, the sporting fraternity of
San Francisco will be disappointed in re
pard to the Maher-Choynski fight, which
was billed to take place before the Na
tional Athletic Club on August 5.
The club had a petition for a permit be
fore the committee, and was so sure of re
ceiving it that it did not see fit to have a
representative present to urge its claims.
Tbe committee, of which Messrs. King,
Benjamin, Dunkerand Morganntern were
present, were not in a lenient mood, how
ever, and when the petition came up it was
refused without a dissenting vote.
"There ia such a thing as riding a gift
horse to death," remarked Supervisor Ben
jamin in explanation of his vote. "Now,
the National Club has had four or five
permits, and I believe that some of tbe
other clubs should have an opportunity.
When we granted the Occidental Club its
first permit it was with the understanding
that it should have two more, the same as
the National Club had when it first
started off.
"I understand that the Occidental's first
performance was not a success, so now I
suppose they will need the other to get
even, and we will have to grant them, as
we promised. We refused the St GÂ«orge
CJub, a highly respectable organization,
on the same score, and I don't see how we
could favor the National after we have
done this. We had to refuse some of these
petitions. We couldn't grant a them all: if
we did, there would be boxing matches
every night, and this, of course, would
not do.
"The Board of Supei visors do not intend
to refuse licenses for boxing entertain
ments altogether, and this committee wili
recommend certain permits, but the di
vision will have to be more equal among
the different ciubs."
It is expected some other club may take
up the Maher-Choynski match.
SCHOOL TEACHERS' SAL ARIES.
Director J. H. Super Favors a Liberal
Policy.
Dr. J. H. Soper, the newly elected School
Director, says that he believes in paying
liberal salaries to teachers and then re
quiring the best service.
"The salary of the average teacher," he
said, "is too low at present, and the men
and women following it earn far less
money than is earned by the representa
tives of the other learned professions.
It is unjust, in my opinion, for directors
to reduce teachers' salaries to make up a
deficiency in the fund, or to withhold a
part of them for a longer or shorter period
of time. Teachers are not supposed to be
capitalists, but if they have any money to
lend they are entitlea to the legal rate of
interest for the use of it."
Dr. Soper is chairman of the Supplies
Committee and a member of the Qualifi
cations and Visiting committees.
The fern is indicative of fascination. In
Saxony the present by a lover to his sweet
heart of a handful of ferns is equivalent to
a proposal.

THE WEEK'S FAILURES.
The Bradstreet Mercantile Agency reports 9
failures for the Pacific Coast States and Territories
for the week endineyesterdav as compared with 17
lor the previous week and 14 for the corresponding
t\eeK or IBPS. The failures are dividea amonc the
mides as follows: 3 saloons, 1 saloon hxtrres, 2
grocers, x furniture, 1 hotel and 1 general store.
Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
a: station indica:e maximum temperature for the
days; tho^e underneath It. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and buudredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lin> s. connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
won! "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually arconiuanitHi by fair weather: "low"
r.fers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washlnston
r;a*:. Wh--n the pressure is high in the interior
and low a.on? the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
en the "lew" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of <Â«reÂ«;on is improb
able, with a "hlKh" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
Will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Jnly 10 The transactions
at the Stock i-.xchange were less than 94,000
snares to-day, and at times there was a close ap
proach to stagnation. The bulletins from Chicago
possessed more attraction for operators than the
record of the sales at the board and the ticicer at
lines was deserted. The withdrawal of $776,000
gold from the sub-treasury, of which 9500.000 is
for Austria caused scarcely a ripple of excitement,
ami had absolutely no effect on stock exchange
values. The dullness during the afternoon ses
sion was relieved by a break in certain ot the in
dustrials. Cotton Oil preferred scored the heaviest
loss, breaking from soyg to 45.
Ihe drop in tli- stock was attributed to tne low
record price for lard, which materially interferes
with marketing of the company's products. Chi
cago Gas, Bay state Gas, Leather preferred and
Colorado Fuel and Iron dropped l<g,'J per cent,
Leather preferred leading. London bought moder
ately of its favorites and foreign bankers here
stated ha; their correspondents were not greatly
concerned about the Chicago platform. Specula
tion closed firm. Net changes show gains of ygjs
lyk P er cent. Cotton oil stocks lost l@ss/g per
cent and Leather preferred ly^ per cent- (sugar
was the most active stock, with 23,300 shares.
St. Paul figured for 15,800, Burlington and Quinty
for 7200 and Leather preferred for 7000 shares.

loss, was traded in to the extent of only 1000

CHICAGO MABKETS.
CHICAGO, But, July 10.â The . wheat market
to-day was still possess" of the .Inert conditions
which have been prevailing characteristics all the
week. The majority of : traders , charged the inac
tivity to the counter attraction s 0 th Democratic
Convention. Â Prices were generally easier, with
lower cables, good receipts (161 cars at Chicago
and 418 In the Northwest) and favorable advices
on the crop were responsible for the weakness.
Withdrawals from : store were 215.000 bushels.
Export clearances amounted to '231,410 bushels.
September- wheat opened from 66% cto 5t3%c and
6614 c, sold between 56Vi and 55% c, clos.ni; at
6684 o 55% c, 8/ a under yesterday. Estimated
recelntÃ tor to-morow, 160 cars.
CORNâ Was slow and without apparent decision
In its undertone, and for that reason simply fol
lowed wheat. Receipts were 391 cars, and 281,
--619 bushels were taken from store. Liverpool
cables were %d lower. Export ' clearances were
213.865 bushels. .-September corn opened at 2t<%

.-';./ DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., July o.â O. Dun A Co.
will say to-morrow in their weekly review of trade:
Failures : for . the * week . have been * 215 ;in . the
United States against 253 last year and 39 In
Canada agatns t35 last year. - , . -
With a political convention In progress directly
antagonizing the position taken on the money
question by the convention of last month It is nat
ural that there has been with many enough un
certainty about the ' future to intensify, the dull
ness expected at this season : Wall street exhibited
no excitement. * though stocks were weaker on
Thursday and closed lower for the week, 25c 1 per
share for railroads, but trusts rose 18 points.
. - The wheat market â  advanced a little while, the '
other speculative markets :. were stagnant or
slightly declined, i but its small advance was
mainly due to reports of foreign crops and needs.'
There were many who believe that the decrease In
yield this year has been underestimated - and I part
of the dispatches gathered by Dun's review last
week tended to support that view, though prac
tically all the returns from what are now the chief
wheat-growl States were more cheering. â  :
' â  Corn 1 and â  oats promise â so well . thus far that
prices do not advance, although exceptionally low
already, and some meats have made a new record
. for cheapness. '*Wti|'li|i jMmwfJUW^WHijW'U
.. Serious apprehension regarding injury by drought
to cotton in Texas seemed justified by some dis
patches published last week, so . that telegraphic
advices of somewhat general rain In the State .Is <
welcome. Whether it Is in ; season or sufficient to
insure a satisfactory, yield cannot be < definitely
known, nor tbe extent of injury said to have been
done by excessive rains In- some Atlantic States.
But with tbe large increase of acreage a yield of at
least fair proportion seems to be probable, and In
view of heavy slocks carried in mills and markets
here and abroad, and mills closing, quite exten
sively to permit lightening of accumulated stocks
of Koods. large yield cou la hardly prove most ben
eficial to tbe producers. ' 'llimiljaimiiinitlciiiiinnuC
Large sales of print cloths are â  reported at 2%c, .
slightly above the bottom prices, but other goods
have not ;yet been strengthened, â¢ .some decrease
appears In the demand for boots and ' shoes ' since
higher prices have been asked. Tinnii|itglMiiWMlllll(
Not much can be said of .. a market so flat â¢as
that of. iron and steel products.' but part of the in
activity is strictly reasonable; patt is due | to | still
unsettled conditions about wages and much more
to general disposition to defer orders until the fu
ture is clearer. - . â : ."V'.u*-v.<. â .;â â - â â ';â¢-â:.-: ;;~~? ; . v

. â¢ COALâ Harrison's circular says: "During tbe
week there have been six* arrivals from the Coast
collieries with 11,297 tons of Coal and Christine
from Sydney with 2990 tons. Business in the fuel
line has been very dull for several weeks past, and
orders have DÂ«en very light tor the steam trade as
well as for house uses. As Is usual at this season
1 of the year, the consumption of 1 Coal for domes to
purposes is materially diminished, in July ice has
tbe call, not' Coat Some 'of our large consumers
of crude oil are I canceling I their contracts and are
swerving oatk to CoaL as the present low prices of
steam grade justify heir doing so from an economi
cal standpoint. The total arrivals from all foreun
sources for the past 30 days only amount to 16,440
tons, this is exclusive of shipments from British
Columoia. This Is mainly attributable to the ces
sation of shipments from Newcastle, N. S. w., for
the past 11 weeks, caused by the strike 'there,
which is still In force. [ A private t telegram from
Newcastle, N. S. W., states that: the Duckenrield
colliery will resume work next Monday. -Ed,
Call, j One conclusive fact has become evident,
that we are self sustaining on the 'fuel' question
locally, without drawing any supplies . from the
Colonies, as the market prices here nave not been ;
advanced in tbe face of a protracted discontinuance
of Australian ; shipments. r It 'is - singular that the
British Columbian managers have not made their

RELIC OF EUGENE HOUGH
The Board of Health Expected to
Produce a Small Sen
sation.
MAYOR DAVIE IS INDIFFERENT
If the L"dy Is Unseated It Will Not
Be to Satisfy His Desire
for Revenge.
Oakland Office San Feaxcipco Call.)
908 Broadway, July 10. \
Members of the old school of medicine
declare that in a few days Mayor Davie
will be revenged for the chagrin of a year
ago when his lady appointee on the Board
of Heaith refused to vote for his Honor's
candidate for secretary of the board.
Should sucti be trne, it means the dls-
Dr. Sarah I. Shuey, President of the Board of Health, Who May Be Unseated by
Members of Her Own School on Account of Politics.
omfiture of a lady â Dr. Sarah Shuey,
president of the board. It means that she
will be deposed from her position of honor,
for such is the only manner in which the
affair of a year ago can be offset.
Last week the Board of Health, by the
aid of the homeopathic members recently
appointed by the Mayor, summarily dis
missed the allopathic Health Officer and
appointed one of their own school. At
their next meeting other heads will fall,
and it is expected that the secretary, Paul
Bchaffer, will be succeeded by ex-Harbor
Commissioner C. O. Alexander, who has
been favored by the Mayor, and who would
have been elected long ago but for the
neeative vote of Dr. Shuey.
It has always been supposed that Dr.
Sarah Shuey was appointed by Mayor
Davie for the express purpose of bringing
about a change in the secretaryship.
Such is not the case, and according to the
story of one of the Mayor's closest friends
the lady doctor owed her appointment to
the labor orator, Eugene Hough, who has
since located in the East.
Hough was one of the best informed and
most effective speakers in Oakland and
made the campaign that resulted in the
election of Davie. After the election
Davie asked Hough what he could do for
him.
"I want nothing," said Hough. "It
would destroy my usefulness if I took any
municipal appointment. However, I
want a place for my friend Thurman. He
is worthy, has a family and has poor
health."
Davie agreed to do all he could for
Thurman and the secretaryship of the
Board of Health was decided upon.
Hough agreed to tind a doctor who was
hitrh in the profession and who was favor
able to Thurman. He found Dr. Shuey
and the Mayor appointed her. When the
time came Dr. Shuey considered that the
best interests of the office would be sub
served oy retaining Paul Schaffer. Thur
man was elected for two weeks, but
Schaffer was put Back.
Then it was reported that the Mayor
and the doctor were enemies from i euce
forth. The story had no foundation in
fact, but waÃ repeated so often that it
seemed at last as if the principals be
lieved it.
Just before the allopaths Trent out of
office a month ago they appointed Dr
Sbuey president and she still holds the
office. She is also an allopatti, so that the
other three members of the board, who are
of the school, must choose ' between
their fealty to their profession, their eal-
Jantry to a lady and their loyalty to "the I
Mayor.
"This matter possesses no interest for I
me," said the Mayor to-day. "It is a mis- !
take to suppose that I am dictating the |
policy of the Board of Health. I believe j
all the members are able physicians and
quite capable of managing the affairs of
the department. If Dr. Shuey be deposed
as president it certainly will not be
through any influence of mine."

SPENT TWO YEARS
IN THE SOUDAN.
Dr. Eric Lewis Arrives
and Will Speak at the
Y. M, C. A.
TRAVELER AND ORATOR.
European Diplomats Ignorant of
the True Character of a
Soudanese.
HOSPITABLE BUT CEAFTY.
The Noted Scholar Will Deliver Two
Free Lectures During His
Short Stay.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 10. \
Dr. Eric Lewis, a traveler and linguist,
and a graduate of Cambridge, England,
Dr. Erie Lewis, the Soudanese Traveler, in the Garb Presented to Him by a
Noted Sheikh.
arriv d to-day and has promised to deliver
two lectures on Soudan and the Soudanese.
One of these will be at the Y. M. C. A.
Hall Sunday afternoon and the other at
the First Christian Church on Sunday
evening.
Dr. Lewis has just completed two years
of travel in the Soudan and adjacent
countries and has compiled a mass of in
teresting data relating to that country.
He has studied the people, their country
and their manners, and is well posted on
the Egyptian question, which is now
puzzling the powers of Europe.
'*! have paid particular attention to the
differences of opinion that exist regarding
the Soudanese," said Dr. Lewis, "and I
have come to the conclusion that they
cannot be controlled by any foreign power
any more than a leopard can change its
sputa,
"The diplomats of Euiope do not under
stand the Soudanese nature, and until
they do, the reports of guerrilla warfare
and events such as the death of General
Gordon must be expected. They are a
hospitable people, and are no more ad
vanced in what we call civilization than
they were a thousand year's ago. They are
not a cruel race, as some of the reports
published make it appear. When an out
rage is committed it is made to appear as
bad as possible, and as most of the dis
siminators of news from that country are
English, nothing is said of the circum
stances which wrought the outrage.
"Soudan is not a country rich in natural
resources. There is not much to develop
and the Soudanese are as nomadic as they
ever were. It is an impossibility to adapt
them to western methods of life and gov
ernment and the sooner this is realized
the sooner the periodical loss of life
through intermittent warfare will cease.
That country has cost Great Britain a
mine of money, and as a matter of fact
she is not any nearer to reducing it to sub
jection than when General Gordon's life
was sacrificed nearly twenty years ago.*'
When lecturing Dr. Lewis wears a Sou
denese garb that was presented to him by
a noted nheikb, who was highly interested
in the traveler. It consists of a large flow
ing robe, a turban and an enormous hat,
but it cannot be said that it is picturesque
to a western eye. It is just a little less
attractive than bloomers.
He has made America his home for
many years and is a forceful platform
speaker. ____________
WATER COMPANY PROTEST
Contra Costa Corporation Objects
to Its Franchise Assess
ments.
Tbe Board of Equalization Asks for
an Extension of Time Over
Dalton's Objections.
Oakland Orrics Bak Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, July 10. j
The Board of Equalization met this
morning, and were greeted with six appli
cations for reductions of assessments.
James Letter filed one, tbe Contra Costa
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
Water Company four and A. C. Bernard
one.
The first and last parties were exam
ined and their cases were taken under ad
visement, while Monday afternoon at 2
o clock was set for hearing the testimony
in the cases of the water company. Mr.
Letter owns property on the corner of
| Eleventh and Clay streets which is mort
| gaged for $7500. He swore that last year
he paid taxes on $6200. He sold two of
his houses since. He believed that if the
property was to De sold to-day it would
not bring more than $6500. Assessor Dal
toii testified that he thought the property
assessed properly, and the case went over.
J. H. T. Watkinson, agent and acting
for tlje water company, said the franchise
of his company is a right in cbmmon ana
open to all persons and corporations under
the constitution of this State and is being
used and exercised by other corporations
and persons in the city of Oakland and is
not at all assessable, and is not of any
tangible value and did not exceed in value
$1000, if anything. He asks that the as
sessments on the franchises in Oakland,
which are placed at $150,000 by tbe As
sessor, be stricken from the roll or placed
at $1000; in Oakland Township, assessed at
$25,000, reduced to $500 or be stricken from
the roll; Eden Towns ip, assessed at $25,
--00 C, reduce to $500 or nothing; Brooklyn
Township, assessed at $5000. reduce to $500
or nothing.
Supervisor Church moved that the
clerk be instructed to ask the State Board
of Equalization, which convenes in Sacra
mento next Monday, for an extension of
ten days in which to examine and equalize
the assessments. He stated that be un
derstood all of the banks were coining in
to fight their assessments, and if such
was the case they would be compelled to
have more time. He said tne board would
meet Monday, and the!) adjourn for a
month, and if this reqiest were not made
now it would be too fate to make it.
Assessor Dalton asked permission to ad
dress the board at this point and said :
"It seems to me it is not right to anticipate
what is going to be and ask for more time.
If you ask for an extension of time and it
is granted the people are going to wait
until the eleventh nour before they come
here. That is what they did last year. I
think it will only unnecessarily delay mat
ters."
Supervisor Talcott seconded the motion,
after which Mr. Church added : "It is not
a question of anticipation on our part, but
the people have anticipated something.
They have called a mass-meeting for Mon
day night in the Exposition building."
The motion was carried, with only Su
pervisor Pelouze voting no.

fifteen feet distant. Camocia was hurled
a distance of sixty feet. The right side of
his head was crusned in and his body was

A POPULIST VIEW
OF DEMOCRACY.
Wardall Admires Bryan,
but Sneers at the
Platform.
WILL HAVE NO FUSION.
The People's Party Leader Re
views the Democratic Na
tional Platform.
CALLS IT A STUMP SPEECH.
Southern Party Bitterness Will Pre
vent Any Alliance With the
Democrats.
A Populist estimate of the Democratic
platform, W. J. Bryan and the political
prospects of the Democratic and Populist
parties was expressed yesterday by E. M.
Wardall, chairman of the State Central
Committee of the People's party.
Mr. Wardall, who is a plain, level-headed
fellow, who always talks with candid good
setibe and never gets excited, says that
Brvan is a strong candidate, but that he
looks at the platform more than at the i
nominee, and that with the exception of
the silver and one or two other planks, the
Democratic platform is a loose stump
speech full of well-sounding phrases that
may mean anything or nothing.
Wardail says that the Populist party will
go ahead independently and would prob
auly nominate Teller if he would come
into the Populist party first and stand
squarely on its platform.
The Populist leader sat with State Sec
retary R. E. Bush at the People's party
State headquarters in the Donohoe build
ing, at Market and Taylor streets, where
the business that now goes quietly on con
cerns mainly the preparations for the St.
Louis convention on the 22d inst. and the
departure of the California delegation on
the 16ih inst.
"I think that Bryan is the strongest man
they could have put up," said Mr. War
dall, in expressing early impressions three
hours after Bryan had been named in Chi
cago. "He is a magnetic man, and as far
as I know he has a clean record. He is a
man of ability and took a strong stand
with Maguire in Congress in opposition to
the funding bill.
"But his weakness is that he is a West
ern man. He is in a section of the coun
try that it is impossible for the Democrats
to carry. Nebraska has a Populist Gover
nor, and its Democracy is split wide open.
His majorities will have to come mainly
from Indiana and Ohio and some States
about them. He cannot carry States that
Bland or Blackburn would carry.
"I would rather have seen Bland nomi
nated. Bland might nave s> cured even
more electoral votes than Bryan wiil, but
Bryan will hurt us more. He is a young,
bright, brainy man with no war record to
be used again-t him either way, and he
wiil appeal to the progressive West, where
be will come into competition with us
more than Bland would nave done.
"There is no possibility of our indorsing
Bryan."
'"'You see our strength is in the South."
put in Secretary Bush on this point, "and
tnere our fight is with the Democrats. We
are nearer to the Republicans there. The
Democrats are the ones that have counted
us out of offices in the South and the feel
ing between the parties is bitter from
Texas to Georgia. The South will largely
control our convention as far as the selec
tion of a candidate is concerned.' 1
"The election of Bryan on the Demo
cratic platform." continued Mr. Waraall,
"would afford but little and temporary
relicf â just enough to make it impossible
to get adequate relief later. We would
rather wait iour years and get what we
want.
"I think that the silver Republicans
will come to us, and if so we will carry
many Western States. The majority of
the party will favor Teller if he will stand
on our platform. We will not nominate
him as a silver Republican.
"But the man nominated at Chicago
doesn't cut the main figure. What Igo
on is this," and Mr. Wardall pulled from
a boos a copy of the Chicago platform,
which he proceeded to briefly analyze in
a cursory way, according to his own no
tions. His analysis suggests that a great
many oth^r sensible American citizens
will analyze it the same way when the
thinking period fairly arrives.
"This is a weak platform. It isn't
specific. It reads like a stump speech and
a loose one at that.
"Let's see. This free-coinage plank is
plain enough and is about what we would
adopt, as tar as the first sentence goe3, but
the next I am in doubt about. It seems
to favor letting all existing contracts to
pay in gold stand as they are, while
favoring a law preventing future special
contracts to pay in gold. We believe that
money that is good enough to pay the
Government in is pood enough to pay
niorttjages in an<l that existing special
contracts to pay in gold ought to be de
clared void. A law should declare that all
contracts should be payable in any legal
tender money and I believe that our con
vention will so declare.
"This paragraph about 'bonds' is a good,
fair declaration in part, but at the end is
something we cannot agree with. It saya:
'And we demand all the paper money
which is made legal tender for public and
private debts, or which is receivable for
dues to the United States, shall be issued
by the Government of the United States
and shall be redeemable in coin.'
"We are opposed to the redemption of
greenbacks in coin. That is one of the
troubles now. Green bacKs are used to
pump gold out of the treasury. It is an
other way of maintaining the gold stand
ard. Money should be interchangeable
and not redeemable in any other kind ex
cept at the option of the Government. As
a whole the financial question is not cov
ered completely and satisfactorily.
"The whole tariff plank doesn't mean
anything except that the McKinley bill is
'denounced,' and we are not with them in
that. We demand a protective tariff, bat
one that will protect the laborer and pro
ducer and not the trusts. The plank
doesn't say anything for the Wilson bill.
It is a dodge, it is insincere and it doesn't
express any party attitude.
"The income tax plank might mean
anything. We demand a constitutional
amendment, if necessary, to establish a
graduated income tax.
"This labor plank is a peculiar thing.
It talks about preventing the importation
of 'foreitn pauper labor,' but imported
cheap labor is not necessarily 'pauper'
labor. Like Jhe rest of the platform, it is
a loose stumii speech instead of a declara
tion of principles. It doesn't demand the
restriction of foreign immigration. 'Pau
per labor' doesn't mean anything. The
plank doesn't pledge the party to any
thing and is merely written to catch the
eye of the people.
"Tlie same paragraph says regarding J
railroads: 'We demand the enlargement
of the powers of the Intersiate Commerce
Commission and such restrictions and
guarantees in the control of railroads as
will protect the people from robbery and
oppression.' That is meaningless. It
doesn't say that rates should be lowered
or the water squeezed oat of stock. The j
Interstate Commerce Commission can't do
anything. The courts will protect the
stockholders belore the people. W> de
clare that the Government can't control
what it doesn't own.
"Here's something about 'taxation.'
'We denounce the profligate waste of
money wrung from ths people by oppres
sive taxation' and so on. It's ali generali
ties and contains no promise of anything.
It mis;ht be construed into opposition to
drinking champagne at government ex
pense.
"I must say that I approve the plank
about 'Federal interference,' though it is
not as clear and specific as I would like;
and the funding bill paragraph is all
right. The paragraph about Cuba isn't
half strong enough.
"Well, taking it up one side and down
the otneV there is a contain degree of
similarity between the Democratic plat
form and what ours will be in regard to
silver, the revenue tax, cou^t injunctions,
opposition to bonds and opposition to the
funding bill.
*"our platform will oracticaliy be an
anti-monopoly platform of four proposi
tions. Three "planks will deal with finance
and monopoly and the fourth will present
the rem&dy in direct legislation, which is
simply placing the veto power in the
hands oi the people as well as in the
bands of the President. People are goinp
to think thiÃyear and our platform will
be regarded by a large element of the peo
ple almost like the ten commandments.
"Our party has changed in ten years.
We have gained a stamline and character
as a party of the oeople. At Omaha there
were various elements thrown together,
and a platform was rushed together and a
ticket nominated in one or two days.
Things were i.ot thought out. It will be
different with us this year."

DEMOCRATS WANT
SOUND MONEY ONLY,
Local Leaders of the
Party Foresee Disaster
in Free Silver.
CALIFORNIA MADE A TAIL TO THE SILVER
STATES' KITE.
"The Most Deplorable of Evils Which May
Completely Overthrow American
Institutions."
"In flying to free silver as a remedy and Imagining that debasement ot tbe
currency will uproot monopoly, in my deliberate judgment, we are permitting
California, which is a gold-producing State, to be used as a tail to the kite of
Nevada and other States where silver is the leading industry, and entailing upon
ourselves the most deplorable evils, which it will take generations to eradicate,
even if they do not lead to the complete overthrow of our institutions." â Henry
IS. Higrhton, the Democratic "war-home."
"The country has gone crazy over the free-Silver fallacy." â E. R. L,ilienthal.
"I don't think the Democratic party is sincere in its free-silver advocacy. I
will not vote t lie ticket, and I do not see how any conscientious Democrat can vote
against his principles."â C. J. Paddock.
"I believe in sound money, and I trill support McKinley for the sake ot
principle." â John T. Doyle.
"The country ha* gone crazy over this fallacy of free silver. It is the har
binger of disaster."â X. R. Lilienthal * Co.
"It is a political measure on the part of Democrats. Mo Democratic mer
chant can afford to support the ticket."â Leon Blum of Roth, Blum & Co.
"A Democrat cannot be honest with himself and vote for the country's ruin
through the medium of free silver." â A. K. Mnnson.
"I cannot vote for the ticket because I cannot vote against principle and my
conscientious convictions. Free silver means a period of great distress for the
country."â C J. Paddock, vice-president of J. A. Folger & Co.
Simultaneously with the nomination of
Bryan, the young politician from Omaha,
as Democratic candidate for the Presi
dency of the United States, there came
yesterday to the hearts and pockets of
thoughtful Democrats in San Francisco an
overpowering sense of impending disaster.
Nor was this disaster plainly visible alone
in the Democratic party, but throughout
every stratum of society of the whole Na
tion. With the spirit of patriotic, though
mistaken, loyalty to party some of these
men openly declared they would link
tneir fortunes with Democracy on election
day, even while admitting in the same
lac-simile r auction of the Circular Letter recently formulated hy the California Biinker3 r 'AiÂ«cÂ»cTaÂ»

To the Banker* of California :
Gentlemen :
Thoughout the Union California is reputed to be "a Silver State." The impression that it is so has been strength
ened by the adoption at a convention recently held in Sacramento by one of the great political parties of a resolution in favor of
the free coinage of silver.
That the Bankers of the State do not share in the delusion that free coinage it a panacea for financial ills is evidenced by a
resolution in favor of the gold standard adopted at the convention of the California Bankers' Association, held at Fresno in Oc
tober last. I
A meeting of the Executive Council of the Association was held in this city on Wednesday, 20th inst, and by the members
present (the representation being nearly full) the time was thought opportune to aeain place the Bankers on record on a question
they deem of vital importance to the country and to this State, and this was done by adoption ot a resolution reading as follows :
"Resolved, That the standard of value in the United States should continue to be the dollar containing 25.80 grains of
"gold, 900 fine, and that any attempt by legiclation or otherwise to lower that standard would be disastrous to the fu
ture welfare of every class of our citizens; aud that silver and governmental paper as forms of currency can only be
"used with safety in such quantity as will be absorbed by the people and remain in circulation constantly without
"throwing upon the Government at any time the burden of redemption to maintain a parity."
The newspapers have published this resolution, but they carefully abstain from discussine it, hence it is not likely to have
the attention of the public to a degree that its importance demands.
A number of copies of this is sent you with the request that you freely circulate them among your customers and corre
spondents both local and Eastern.

breath their hearts were not in assumed
fai thf ulness.
It was hard, indeed, to break away from
party traditions â to be, as it were, home
less wanderers in the field of politics; in
fine, to stand for once for principle and
pocket â to support the sound money
standard of this age against a depreciated
and altogether disastrous one.
Everything was so sudden, so unex

were bitter in their protests against free
and unlimited coinage of silver. Bankers
fairly shuddered at the thought. Students
of finance, men of sound judgment and
strong intellectuality, leaders at the bar,
all alike and all stanch Democrats, rose
up against the free-silver proposition.
They were in revolt and talked their
minds freely. John T. Doyle, the re
spected, venerable lawyer, writer and
advocate of Calif or nian industries, an
nounced bravely with the courage of con
victions based on consciencious study and
a ripe knowledge: "I believe in sound
money, and I will support McKinley for
the sake of principle." And Garret Mo-
Enerney, representing the rising young
division of the divided Democracy, boldly
asserted: "I am unalterably opposed to
the free and unlimited coinage of silver."
Henry E. Highton, the "war-horse" of
Democracy, declared that flying to free
silver was permitting California to be used
as a tail to the kite of silver States where
silver mining has been the leading in
dustry. In fact, language strong enough
could not be used by the leaders of the
Democratic revolution.
Barry Baldwin, the United Btates Mar
shal, announced his loyalty to his party.
"I am in favor of the free coinage of sil
ver," he said, "but then I believe this will
divide the party."
Sands W. Forman, who has for many
years been a leading and zealous Demo
crat, declared that the platform of the
Chicago convention was a surprise to him
and meant disaster to the Democratic
party.
"Prom the beginning of the world, step
by step, the value of currency has ad
vanced," said ue. "From shells it has
gone up to gold, and silver was skipped as
a standard. I cannot see why we should
go back to it â that is, make a Retrogressive
movement. It is a depreciated currency.
Gold is the standard and should be so
maintained. It is the history of Mexico
and the South American States, where sil
ver is the standard, that wages have depre
ciated and the working people have suf
fered.
"If a workingman pays $7 60 for a $5 suit
of clothes, be feels it keenly, and that is
practically what he will have to do if
silver is dominant. For then |7 50 in
silver would be only equal to $5 in gold.
The same thing applies to tne necessaries
of life. You will have to pay more for
them than now, but wages won't advance
a cent. So the ratio will be against the
poor man. It is tbe same old proposition ;
the working people want a change, and
they will make the change without an.

reason. I suppose they are eager to find
what the effect may be.
"This is going to be the most dangerous
experimentâ if it be madeâ that the peo
ple of the United States ever attempted.
All the speeches made in tne *National
Convention at Chicago in favor of silver
were buncombe and slush.
"I think it will burst the Democratic
party wide open. There simply won't be
any Democratic party any more. The
people will want to hang the men who did
U before two years of the free silver regime
will have paused."
Probably no young man in the front
ranks of leading Democrats of California
is more favorably regarded for his keen
insight into all serious and important
questions of the day and tor his sincerity
in treating them than Garret McEnerney.
He says little regarding the financial
problem now before the people, for he evi
dently deems it a plain proposition that
calls for no discussion.
"I am unalterably opposed to the free
coinage of silver," he said yesterday in
reply to a request for his opinion. "I am
a gold Democratâ a Cleveland Democrat."
"On a general proposition I am with the
party," said Alexander T. Vogelsang,
one of the prominent Democrats of San
Francisco, "and I will support the nom
inee Bryan. He won the nomination on
his speech, even though Hill spoke against
him. And Hill is a man for whom I have
a profound respect. I have read a great
deal on this question and I was inclined
to look favorably on the gold standard.
"It is going to be a very serious question
and will disturb things badly." .
Mr. Vogelsang gave an illustration of
how the question has already influenced
public thought.
"I have a client," he continued, "an
estimable lady. She came here to my of
fice and asked my advice as to what she
ought to do with l.er money. She has
money in the savings banks, and wanted
to satisfy herself upon â  the result of a
change in the political situation regarding
money. She asked if it would not be best
to get her money in gold and put it in a
safe-deposit box, so that she would be sure
of the principal, no matter what might
happen. Capital, you kpow, is timid, and
if a financial disturbance should come
upon us it might be disastrous to the
working people. The capitalists can af
ford to wait longer than the workingmen;
they can crawl into their hole and pull
the hole in after them. But the poor man
must have bis money."
The announcement made yesterday on
the street that John T. Doyle, the able
lawyer, writer and well-Known Demo
cratic politician, had declared in favor of
McKinley caused commotion in Demo
cratic circles. He had a firm conviction
that the money question was over and
above all other considerations in im-
portance, and he believed that tne people
at large would be doing nothing more
than sincerely performing a duty in voting
for McKinley and the gold standard.
"I have not changed my political faith,
however," remarked Mr. Doyle. "I am
still a Democrat, and will remain one
until the end of the chapter. I believe in
sound money and I will support McKinley

The well-known 1 attorney Henry E.

cago convention. Though one of the war
horses of the Democracy, Mr. Highton de- â

' 'I bel ieve paternalism to be the final result
of protection and that free stiver is among
the worst forms of paternalism. It is im
possible to argue this question in a shoit
interview.
"I claim to be an American Democrat,
and as such my platform is the fullest de
velopment of the individual Â«nd the se
verest limitation of the powers and func
tions of government consistent with the
maintenance of communities and of the
Union.
"The difficulty with the country is the
confusion of questions which m them
selves are separate and distinct from each
other, and the possible adoption of
imaginary remedies which are worse than
the disease.
"There is a perfectly legitimate opinion
among the masses of our citizens of all
parties against the undue ascendancy of
the money power and the subversion and
corruption of every department of gov
ernment by corporations, trusts and com- I
binations, which represent only them
selves and constitute the most dangerous
form of oligarchy. In this State that opin
ion is intense and is more than justified
by the tyranny of the Southern Pacific
Company and all that it represents.
"In flying to free silver, however, as a
remedy and imagining the debasement of
the currency will uproot monopoly, in my
deliberate judgment, we are permitting
California, which is a gold-producing
State, to be used as a tail to the
kite of Nevada and othir States,
wnere silver is the leading industry, and
entailing upon ourselves the most de
plorable evils, which it will take genera
tions to eradicate, even if they do not lead
to the complete overthrow of our institu
tions. As an American Democrat I am
unable to perceive how I can vote for
Bryan on al6to 1 platform. The proba
bility is that on election day I shall not
v.ote at all.
"I desire to add that, while I do not
concur in all his ideas, I recognize Grover
Cleveland as a great and patriotic Amer
ican, and that I indorse all the main fea
tures of his administration."
"I am a Democrat, though nothing of a
politician." 9aid Leon Blum of the firm of
Roth, Blum <fe Co., "but I am able to com
prehend one thing, and that is the great
political fraud that is being perpetrated by
the Democratic party on itself and the
people at large. It is politics â politics and
not principle. Some enthusiasts go about
spouting over the independence and su
premacy of the United States; that the
United States is big enough to look out for
itself and can make and use any kind of
money it sees fit. They are fools and noth
ing less. We are too small to compel the
countries of Europe to bow down to us,
and too large to be fenced in. , If the Gov
ernment were to adopt free silver, we
would be as bad off as India, China or any
other silver countries. Our business affairs
would virtually be out of oar own hands.
They would be controlled by the markets
of Europe. The laboring man. and in fact
all classes of wage^earners would be the first
to suffer, and yet they are first and fore
most in the cJamor for free coinage. The
employer would buy silver with his gold
and pay off his men in the cheaper metal,
thereby saving himself * percentage on
the poor man's labor.
"The poor man's silver would not go
more than two-thirds as far as it does
now and he must work just as bard. The
price of all commodities would come up to
meet the new commercial exigencies and
to save the merchants whose goods have
to be paid for in gold, but the price ol
labor would be the last to be raised. In

tbe meantime the moneyed men in the

selves as best they could by tacking on
prices and making all their customers sign
contracts to pay in gold coin. No doubt
many of the leading wholesalers and im
porters have already begun tojlo so. It is
not enough that the words 'payable in
gold coin' appear at the top of a rendered
statement or bill. That is not legally
binding. It must be in the shape of a con
tract and signed by both parties. We
cannot afford to take any c nances, and
our safety is the small dealers' loss. They
must sell for silver and pay us gold for
their goods. No Democrat in business or
out can possibly follow his party this year
unless he wishes to blast the prospects of
his country."
"No, I do not support nay party in its
free-silver advocacy," said C. J. Paddock,
vice-president of the J. A. Folger Com
pany, yesterday, "though lam not desir
ous 01 discussing the situation publicly
that is I do not care much about having
my name in print. I shall not vote for a
1 silver candidate simply because 1 cannot
â¢vote against my principles. Ido not see
how any conscientious Democrat can in
dorse such a policy. It means disaster to
all of our business and commercial inter
ests. No merchant, irrespective of his
political predilections, can, in his sane
mind, help to place the conn try under
such a ban by casting his vote for a
silver candidate. I do not think the
party is sincereâ that is to say, the leaders
in whose hands rest the shaping of its
policy. It is a question of expediency.
"If the Republicans had taken a silver
stand the Democrats would have
been for j?old, as they always have been.
I can't vote the ticket and I do not believe
you will find a Democratic merchant in
this City who will admit that his political
patriotism, or more properly speaking,
his partisanship, is stronger than his
principles. It is not only against
political principle, but it is antagonistic
to all the commercial, manufacturing
and mercantile interests of the whole
country. We will be going about buying
cold at a premium, and in a short time
the country will be on a silver basis. Then
where are we? At the mercy of all the
great industrial nations of Europe."
"If the people of California and the
United States want to bring disaster and
ruin on the whole country they will vote
for free silver," said E. R. Lalienthal, the
wholesale liquor merchant. "How any
man. Democrat or Republican, can for
one moment . think that such a policy
would be of benefit to the country's inter
est is more than I can comprehend, unless
it be that ignorance and a lack of care
have led to the fallacy that free silver
means more money and better times for
all hands. That is probably true so far as
the laboring classes are concerned. They
do not stop to think, but take the word of
the silver demagogues that, with free coin
age, they will have dollars where they now
have dimes. Ido not think the Demo
cratic merchants will support the ticket.
How can they? The country has gone
crazy over this claptrap of a catch-word.
There is no sincerity in it, except among
those Democratsâ and Republicans, tooâ
who have direct interests in silver mining
or in States where silver mining is of local
advantage."

ticket. He said yesterday: "No true
Democrat in this or any other State. can
vote for silver. It is not the policy of the
true Democracy, neither is it a grounded
principle of the party. Whether the
Democrats who denounce the silver plat
form will go to McKinley is not for me to
say, but I think many of them will, though
they do not confess as much. It is plain
gold or silver as between Jhe two parties,
and the free coinage of the latter means
ruin to the whole country. Ido not see
why any Democrat should be at all back
ward about expressing his views â it is a
question of principle and not partisanship.
Democrat or Republican, to vote for free
silver is to vote for a periodof great finan

country has never before passed through.
