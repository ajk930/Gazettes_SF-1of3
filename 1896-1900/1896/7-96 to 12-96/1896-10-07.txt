Great Enthusiasm Caused
by the Arrival of Czar
and Czarina.
Never Before Has There Been
Such a Vast Crowd in the
French Metropolis.
MILLIONS LINE THE STREETS-
Police and Soldiers Out in Great
Force to Protect the Royal Visit
ors From Possible Insults.
PaRIS, France, Oct. 6.â The Czar has
come and Paris has gone wild in welcom
ing him. It is believed ihat never before
has such a multitude of strangers been in
the city. It was estimated last night that
over 1,000,000 visitors were here, and all
through the night every arriving train
from the north, south and west brought
in its quota ol' strancers to swell the crowd
already here. Even to-aay the streets
have been packed with late comers. It is
impossible to even approximately esti
mate the number ot visitors, but it would
not be at all surprising if their number
was nearer 2,000,000 than 1,000,000. The
weather was sunny and everything was
propitious for the great popular welcome
that had been prepared for the white Czar,
who is undoubtedly to-day the idol of the
French people.
The railway over which the Czar trav
eled from Cherbourg, from which place he
started last evening, had erected a special
station for the use of his Majesty at Passy
Banlieue. Here an immense crowd was
gathered at an early hour, many of those
present having remained in the vicinity
throughout the night in order to be sure
and get a glimpse of the Czar and Czarina
as the imperial visitors entered the city.
The entire route from the station to the
Russian Embassy at 79 Rue de Grenelle
St. Germain, was packed with people be
fore 8 o'clock. The route was across the
Bois de Boulogne, through the Avenue dv
Bois de Boulogne, Place de l'Etoile, in
which ttands the Arc de Triomphe, thence
down the Avenue dcs Champs Eiy^ees to
ana across the Place de la Concorde, to and
across the Pont de la Concorde and down
the Boulevard St Germain to Rue St. Si
mon, which leads directly to the entrance
of the Russian embassy.
The entire rou'.e was decorated with
magnificent and tasteful arches and pillars
I and French and Russian colors. A nov
elty in decoration wa- seen ou the trees
along the route. These were covered with
paper flowers of all kinds and were very
handsome, the colors adding materially
to the beauty of the scene. The Palais d'ln
dustrie, on Avenue dcs Champs Elysees.
and the Chamber of Deputies, Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, Ministry of War and
Ministry of Public Works, all of which
are close to the Boulevard St. Germain,
were especially noticeable for the beautiful
and artistic arrangement of their decora
tions.
The whole garrison of Paris was turned
out in honor of the imperial visitor and
for tne practical purpose of guarding the
route along which he passed. The soldiers
lined the entire route and back of them
Etood policemen facing the crowd, in
order that they might bb able to detect
and arrest any one who should attempt to
insult the Czar by uttering seditious cries.
The police arrangements were perfect. In
fact, the regulations adopted for the occa
sion were so stringent they occasioned
some adverse comment, but the author
ities believe they are fully justified in
taking extraordinary precautions to guard
the imperial visitor.
At 8:30 o'clocr the sun was shining
brightly and the crowds were constantly
augmenting. Some of the sightseers were
quite boisterous in their light heartedness,
but there were no signs of disorder. Oc
casiona ly there would be a scuffle in the
crowd as a policeman or detective would
discover a pickpocket plying his trade,
and promptly arrest him or hold him.
Every window and balcony along the
route was occupied, the occupants of the
houses in many instances having been
paid very large sums for the privilege.
President Fanre, the Ministers and
v other dienitaries who had traveled from
Cherbourg on a special train ahead of the
Czar, arrived at Versailles at 8:20 o'clock.
The train bearing the imperial guests
rolled into the station twenty-three min
utes later. M. Faure was in the reception
room, and as the Czar and Czarina
alighted from their train, he stepped for
ward ana greeted them. After a short
conversation between the Ministers' suites
and the suites of the Czar and Czarina,
the Emperor and Empress retired to the
special train, where at 9:06 they proceeded
to the Passy Banlieue station, where the
municipal authorities were waiting to
present their respectc There were thou
sands of people along the railway from
Versailles to Passy Banlieue, and as the
train passed they cheered enthusiasti
cally.
Arrived at Passy Banlieue, the Czar and
Czarina alighted from their carriage, and
as they did so a great shout of welcome
&oundea from the myriads ot people as
sembled about the station. The guard of
honor presented arms, and at a given sig
nal a battery began firing an imperial
salute of 101 guns. Every available space
wa* packed almost to suffocation. It is
stated that fully 20,000 persons slept in the
Bois de Boulogne last night in order that
they might get good places from which to
see the Czar before the immense crowds
arrived from elsew ere in the city. The
cheering lasted for some minutes and was
acknowledged by repeated bows by the
/Czar.
1 The imperial visitors, accompanied by
President Faure and the Ministers, en
tered a tent that had been erected at the
station, and here their Majesties received
the municipal authoiities, a number of
civii and military di.nitaries. After the
reception the Czar and Czarina and Presi
de* Faare entered a gala carriage with
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
postilions, that was awaiting them out
side the tent.
The President: occupied the front seat
with his fack to the horses. The various
officials, members of the Czar and Czar
ina's suites, entered other carriages and
the cortego proceeded at a walking pace to
traverse the streets to the Russian em
bassy.
The Czarina was attired in a handsome
dress of white satin She wore also a cape
and a small bonnet. Her usually grave,
sweet face, wa3 wreathed in smiles and
she appeared to be very happy at the
warmth of the reception accorded to her
and her august husband by the French
people. The Czar was attired in a Russian
military uniform. He did not appear
to be embarrassed, and looked as tuouzh
lie enjoyed the popular acclamations.
President Faure wore a black suit and the
broad sash of the Legion of Honor.
1 As the procession started from the sta
tion the massed bands began playing the
Rus-sian national anthem. At the head of
the cortege marchea a body of Arab chiefs
who had been brought from Africa
especially for the purpose of adding to the
picturesqueness. of the scene. They pre
sented a unique appearance in their white
burnoses. After them came a double line
of troops, chasseurs d'Afrique, zouaves
and Tonquinenez soldiers. Members of
every French regiment were included in
the troops who lined the route, holding
back i he crowds.
When the Czar stepped into the carriage
there were many shouts of "Long Live
the Emperor," "Long Live Russia." But
it was noticed that the cries were not
unanimous. For some reason the assem
blage at the start of the procession was
stiff in its manner; the enthusiasm that a
few minutes before had marked the pro
ceedings appeared to have waned. This
did not continue long, however, and
as the procession advanced the ebullitions
of the vast throng became more pro
nounced. The cheering and the shouts of
welcome rapidly increased as the proces
sion passed through the Bois de Boulogne
and as it entered the Avenue dv Bois de
Boulogne the. multitude became fairly
frantic in their reception of the Czar and
Czarina. From this stage of the Czar's
advance in til the Russian embassy was
reached, there was one continuous roar
of cheers, in which the spectators in the
windows joined equally with those in the
streets. From many balconies ladies
threw flowers in front of the imperial car
riage, and after the procession the people
made a wild scramble for them.
When the Czar arrived at the embassy
be was welcomed by Baron Mohrenhe m,
the Russian Embassador. After a short
conversation their Majesties retired to
the "apartments set apart for their use,
where they rested for a time. The Czar
and Czarina lunched with their suites and
the personnel of the embassy. At2o'clock
they entered a carriage and were driven to
the Russian church in Rue Daru to give
thanks for their safe journey. The impe
rial couple traversed the same route they
had followed from the railway station as
far as the Arc de Triomphe. Here
they turned up the avenne, driv
ing up to Rue dv Faubourg St, Honore,
from which Rue Daru runs to Rue de
Courcelles. The church is situated directly
opposite tbe end of the Rue Pierre le
Grande, and with its gilded domes is
plainly visible for a considerable distance.
Large crowds were assembled in the vicin
ity and their Majesties were again the re
cipients of an enthusiastic ovation as they
entered the church. They were accom
panied by their suites and the members of
the embassy. The services at the church
included the singing of the Te Deum.
Later in the afternoon their Majesties
were driven to tne palace of the Eiysee,
escorted by cuirassiers, where they made
a formal visit to President Faure. The
route to the palace was lined with people,
who gave a respectful but enthusiastic ova
tion to the guests of the nation.
The Czarina, in response to tbe cheers of
the multitude along the route from the em
bassy to the palace and back, bowed grace
fully at intervals, and the Czar was kept
constantly busy returning salutations ex
tended to him. The President gave a re
ception in their honor at the palace, to

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 7, 1896.
CLAUS SPRECKELS, President of the San Joaquin Valley and San Francisco Railroad,
Who Was Accorded a Tremendous Ovatior During the Celebration at Fresno
of the Valley's Freedom From Monopoly's Rule*
which were bidden among the guests sev
eral of the heads of the great families of
France.
Later the Czar gave a reception at the
Russian embassy, whence President
Faure proceeded in state to return the
visit of the Czar and Czarina.
In the evening the President gave a ban
quet in honor of the imperial visitors at
the palace of the E ysee. The dining
room was handsomely decorated and the
illumination was magnificent. Among
the 200 guests invited to attend the ban
quet were the President of the Senate and
the Chamber, the Ministers, the general
commandine the army corps and the great
state officials. After the dinner the Czar
and the Czarina attended a gala perform
ance at the opera. To this performance a
number of Senators and Deputies were in
vited.
The entire programme for the day was
carried out without a hitch and those hav
ing the arrangements in charge are highly
gratified with their success.
The city to-night was one mass of illu
mination. The river Seine looked weirdly
beautiful as it reflected tbe thousands
upon thousands of lights burning along
\ts banks and upon passing vessels.
AT THE EVENING BANQUET.
JPreiident JFaure and Czar Nicholas Ex
change Pleasant Word*.
' .PARIS. France, Oct. 6.â At the banquet
at the . Palace of the . Eiysee, President
Faure, in proposing a toast in honor of
the Czar, said: .. .!
"Your Majesty's presence has, amid the
acclamations of our whole people, sealed
the ties uniting our two countries in har
monious activity amid mutual confidence
in their destinies. The union of your
powerful empire and our republic has
already exercised a beneficial effect upon
the peace of the world. Fortified by tried
fidelity it will continue to spread its
fortunate influence everywhere."
The remainder of the President's re
marks consisted of compliments and good
wishes. The Czar in reply to the toast
said:
"I am deeply touched by the welcome
extended to the Empress and myself in
great Paris, the center of much genius,
taste and Jight. Faithful to imperishable
tradition. I have come to France to greet
you, Monsieur President, the chief of the
nation to which we are united by such
precious ties. As you have said, the union
cannot but produce by its constancy a
most fortunate influence. 1 beg you to
interpret these sentiments to the whole of
France."
Along the boulevards and principal
streets to-nig t varicolored lanterns were
swung in festoons upon the trees, produc
ing a most beautiful effect among the
foliage. The Place de la Concorde was
one blaze of light, and all the chief build
ings, from the church of Notre Dame on
the Isle de la Cite to the Place of the
Trocadero, were outlined in flame. Late
in the evening a flotilla of illuminated
boats passed down the Seine, presenting a
beautiful spectacle.
Thousands of persons paraded along
the river froat between Notre Dame and
the Trocadero lost in admiration of the
magnificence of the illumination, which
it is believed was never before equaled.
Paris to-night well deserves the appella
tion of "City of Light."
There were displays of fireworks at six
places in the city. The most, beautiful
displays were along the banks of the
Seine between the Eiffel tower and the
palace of the Trocadero, which is directly
opposite the tower.
The Pont de Jena, which connects the
grounds of the Trocadero with the Champ
de Mars on which tbe tower stands,
looked like a dream of fairyland, it being
illuminated with thousands of small
electric lights.
After the banquet the imperial party
watched from the loggia of the Trocadero
the illumination of the Eiffel tower, which
pointed skyward like a gigantic finger of
fire, and then turned into a cascade of
tumbling flame. The sight was ex
quisite.
When the Czar and Czarina returned to
the Russian embassy, after the close of
the day's functions, they were wildly
acclaimed by ti e crowds. It was the con
sensus of opinion among everybody here
that Paris and the visitors will admit that
Parisians have fairly outdone themselves
in showing honor to the Czar.
IT IS NOT YET SETTLED.
But Developments in the Venezuelan
Cn*e Are Expected.
LONDON, Ekg., Oct. 6.â lnformation
has been furnished to the United Associ
ated Presses that no communication has
passed between Great Britain and the
United States on the subject of arbitration
in over a month. Important develop
ments in connection with Venezuela, how
ever, will probably occur in October.
A settlement of tha dispute is by no
means imminent and it is not true, as has
been alleged, that Great Britain has been
making concessions to Venezuela. Much
depends upon Mr. Chamberlain, Secretary
of State for the Colonies, who sailed from
New York for England on September 30,
though his decisions are subject to the
approval of Lord Salisbury. The latter,
the Foreign Office officials say, is hopeful
that the Venezuelan question will be
solved, but he is at present occupied by
the Eastern question.

PRAISE FOR CLAUS SPRECKELS
Expressions cf Hearty Good Will
From tbe Peop'e of the San
J:aquin.
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 6.â While the city
to-day, in comparison with yesterday, ia
as a sideshow to a circus of rejoicing, still
the people did not yet seem to have
enough of the celebration of the opening
of tbe San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railroad, which was consummated
yesterday with such great success. SevÂ«
eral thousand people remained over night
to see, possibly, how it all looked the day
after, and when they did look they saw a
modified repetition of the same scenes.
Fresno is making the most of it.
Business men, manufacturers and farm
ers arose this morning with a fuller reali
zation of the significance of yesterday's
celebration not only to themselves but to
the whole San Joaquin Valley. So quite
a number of them got out their exhibits
again to-day and they were driven through
the principal streets. One farmer with a
unique load of corn in the ear, declared
his intention of driving under the tri
umphal arch again, and he carried it out.
Hundreds walked out to the five-acre
depot grounds, which had been cleared
for the celebration, and inspected them
with interest and deliberation. The rail
road is now an accomplished fact, with
freight trains carrying products to mar
ket, and the few castles in the air that
may have been built by the second day's
soberer visitors to the terminal grounds
were not only pardonable, but had a foun
dation on 125 miles of steel rails, one of
the best roadbeds and the best rolling
stock in California.
The new locomotives have a sort of
chime for a whistle, and there were doubt
less some who turned their ears to the
south and tbe future, and beard the har
mony of the whistles of an "overland"
train approaching the metropolis of a
valley which, Claus Spreckels said, tbe
youneer generation now living would see
supporting in abundance a population of
5,000.000 people.
Tbe decorations in the streets are still
up. They will be allowed to remain in
definitely. The city is loth to take off the
garments in which she celebrated her de
liverance from the throttling freight and
passenger tariffs of the Southern Pacific
Company.
A force of men was put at work this
afternoon removing the remnants of the
great barbecue. There were no remnants
to remove except the dishes, tables and
benches.
The multitude, which had fed on more
than "loaves and fishes," had carried
away the rest of it in perfect comfort and
satisfaction.
President Clans Spreckels and the San
Francisco directors of the road left at 2:40
o'clock this morning for San Francisco.
As late or early the hour may be, technic
ally considered, a number of prominent
citizens of Fresno saw them off with many
hearty expressions of good will. There is
no name more revered in the entire San
Joaquin Valley than that of Claus
Spreckels.
It would require a descriptive pen with
very flexible and facile points to do
justice to the subject of the reception of
the first train into Fresno yesterday.
There were acres of waving umbrellas and
hats and handkerchiefs, acres of solid
humanity and a unanimity of cheers
which resounded far beyond the limits of
the greatest throng of enthusiastic people
that ever assembled in the valley.
The train was welcomed hjr a multitude
the limits of which were visible to a field
glass, but whose feeling of gladness at
liberation from a tax on their toil and cap
ital was not to be measured except by
a sight and sympathy that perceives the
sunlight after years of clouds.
Freieht traffic is already busy on tbe
road. Regular passenger traffic will open
in a tew weeks with the completion of the
construction of more depot facilities.
The Fresno County Fair opened today.

PITTSBURGH Pa., Oct. 6.â A bad acci
dent took place early this morning on the
Pennsylvania Railroad, near Donoboe
station, in which at least two : lives were
lost. An extra freight train bound east
broke in two on the grade near that place
and the two sections collided with terrific
force, causine one of the worst wrecks
ever seen in this part of the road.
Fourteen cars full of merchandise were
smashed and piled into a heap of wreck

BRYAN APPEARS
AT INDIANAPOLIS
Curiosity Causes Thousands
to See the Nebraska
Orator.
National Democrats Called a
Fraud by the Silver
Candidate.
MR. BYNUM ALSO ASSAILED.
P,enty of Word- by the Young Elocu
tionist to Bo ster Up the Chicago
P.atform
INDIANAPOLIS. I.yd., Oct. 6. â In
dianapolis exceeded the most sanguine
expectations of the local and Slate sup
porters of William Jennings Bryan in the
series of remarkable demonstrations
givea the Chicago nominee to-day. Tne
outpouring of people was extraordinary.
l''rom the time Mr. Bryan reached this
city early in the afternoon until he con
cluded his last address to-night he was the
center of the great enthusiasm indulged
in by countless thousands of Indianans.
The committee in charge of the arrange
ments gave Mr. Bryan an opportunity to
test his physical ability to its utmost, for
it had provided for no less than four
speeches by the candidate in various parts
of the city.
The first meeting was at the hall where
the State Legislatures hold their meet
ings, at 3 o'clock, and was followed by a
meeting in front of Tomlinson Hall. Mr.
Bryan begged off from making a third
afternoon address, as arranged by the
committee, compromising by promising
to give two speeches in the evening in
stead of one.
Mr. Bryan's arrival from Louisville was
the signal for the beginning of the con
tinued ovation. Excursionists from many
parts of the State helped swell the crowds
on the streets along the line of bis
progress from Meridian street where he
left the train to tbe Grand Hotel, his abid
ing place while here. The Bryan and
Sewall Traveling Men's Club and many
other political organizations were in the
escort procession. The Cleveland Club of
Indianapolis acted as Mr. Bryan's per
sonal escort and marched throughout the
day beside the carriage drawn by six
white horses, in which he sat with Gov
ernor Matthews, Mayor Taggart and John
W. Tomlinson of Alabama, a member of
the National Democratic Advisory Com
mittee who will accompany Mr. Bryan
through the West. Mr. Bryan was
cheered almost continuously along his
route by the thousands of citizens who
Jined the streets and sidewalks.
At 3 o'clock the candidate drove to the j
State House and delivered an open-air ad- I
dress to a crowd that was nearly, if not
quite, equal to the crowd to which he
spoke at Columbus, Ohio, and on Boston
common, the banner crowds of his cam
paign. Another tremendous throng
awaited him outside Tomlinson Hall,
where he spoke from the baicony at 4:30.
To-night he addressed two more great
gatherings, one inside and the other out
side Tomlinson Hall. There is no doubt
that the number of people who heard him
here to-day exceeded by far ibe aggregate
of his audience in any other city since the
campaign began.
All along the route to Indianapolis the
demonstrations were repeated. At Sey
mour 4000 or 5000 people heard Mr. Bryan :
a throng between 8000 and 10.000 was at
Columbus; Edinburgh turned out 3500 and
Franklin nearly if not quite 5000.
Estimates of the size of the crowd be
fore which Mr. Bryan appeared at the
State House go as high as 60.000. A very
conservative estimate is 35,000. The peo
ple were packed in a solid mass tightly
wedged together and movement was abso
lutely impossible. From the temporary
stand erected in the State House yard
Governor Matthews introduced "Mr.
Bryan. A bedlam of enthusiasm broke
forth from the crowd and it was some
time before Mr. Bryan could proceed. His
speech was frequently interrupted by
wild cheering. He said :
This city enjoys the unique distinction of
being the birthplace and the deathbed of a go
called party. [Applause.] My friends, I know
that I am not obeying the Bible injunction.
'â¢Let the dead bury their dead." when I SDeak
of thi3 so-called Democratic party. [Cheers.]
I speak of it as I would not speak oi any
bona-fide organization of men. But this party
occupies a peculiar place in history. It calls
itself the National Democratic party when it
does not expect to carry a tingle county in the
â whole Union. [Cheers and laughter.] It called
itself a Democratic party when it was organ
ized for the express purpose of electing a Re
publican candidate for President [Great
cheering.] If it was big enough to justiiy the
name it would be a stupendous fraud [loud
laughter], but it is too small to be called
stupendous. [Laughter and cheers.] I will
call It a transparent fraud. [Cheers.] It was
the first political convention ever held in this
country where the members of the committee
nominated a ticket that they did not expect to
vote for, and the first place where men have
received a nomination and don't want to be
voted for. [Cheers and laughter.]
The minority plank in the Chicago platform
opposed free coinage, on the ground that it
would interfere with International bimetal
lism, and when they failed to secure the adop
tion of that plank they assembled in conven
tion here and forgot all about international
bimetallism. [Applause.]
There has been no clearer evidence of iv
tended deception than is found in the fact
that the minority at Chicago, when they had
things all their own way, repudiated the
planks they stood on there and came out in
favor of a gold standard instead of inter
national bimetallism. [Cheering.] My friends,
I am willing to meet an open enemy in an
open field and concede to that enemy ail the
rights and privileges of open warfare, but
when our opponents call themselves advocates
of sound money and want to fasten upon us
an unsound financial system; when they call
themselves the advocates of honest money and
then demolish honesty; when they say that
they are a Democratic party and yet employ
speakers and openly say they are going to vote
the Republican ticketâ that party does not de
serve to be treated like an opponent in this
campaign. [Applause.]
My friends, I have no criticism to make of
any man who believes that the election of the
Chicago ticket would destroy this country and
who votes the Republican ticket, but, my
friends, to find a man who wants to elect ths
Republican ticket and then has not the cour
age to bear the odium of advocating it is an
entirely different matter. ["'GiveittoÃynum,"
cried a voice.] If you want to know what that
distinguished citizenâ ["Extinguished," came
from the crowd.] The gentleman suggests ex
tinguished citizen [great cheering and laugh
ter], but I will say aibtinguished because he
has a past, whether he has any future or cot.
[Great cheering and laughter.] If you want to
know what be said about the gold standard let
me read from his speech In favor of silver in
1886: "Again the advocates of gold approach
us with open hands and smiling countenances,
but I fear that the dagger Is concealed beneath
their coats." Ah, my friends, he understood
the nature of the animal before he began to
associate with it
He is right in his description. The gold
standard never fought an open fight. It car
ries the knife of the assassin and does its work
behind the mask of a burglar. It is not an
open enemy, never was, and never will be.
[Great cheering.] Now, see how well be un
derstood them. Be said: "Oh, they say,
we want silver, we are bimetal lists, but we
%\ ant an honest dollar. Suspend coinage and
we will drive England, Germany and other na
tions to bimetallism and then the price of si
*er bullion will appreciate Ad our dollaij
will be worth a hundred centi.' " [Cheering.]
That was what was saia in 1886. My friends,
instead of saying now that we will adopt bi
metallism and drive other nations to it, he
says that we will stand by the gold standard
and allow other nations to drive us away from
it. [Applause.]
The rest of the speech was devoled to a
discussion oi the silver qnestion on lines
familiar to readers of his previous ad
dresses.
The six black horses that drew the
candidate's carriage from the State House
to Tomlinson's Hall cavorted all along the
way past cheering people on the side
walks. About 15,000 people were in the
audience ther?. They were quite as en
thusiastic as the vast throng at the State
House. Mr. Bryan spoke from the balcony
of the hall. He said in the course of his
remarks that when he came to Indian
apolis opponents had discovered a new
method of warfare. He said:
I found that in the State of Indiana the Re
publicans'were circulating an editorial which
appeared in tho Oniaba World-Herald about
tour years ago. It was an editorial which
criticised pensions and pension appropria
tions, Â»ud it was stated that tbat was my
language because I was the editor of the paper.
But I need not tell you, because you have al
ready been told before, that that editorial ap
peared in the World-Herald about two years
before I had any connection whatever with the
par>er. [Cheering.]
There is no reason why any soldier who
believes in the principles set forth in the
Chicago platform should vote against the
nominees of that convention. If there are
soldiers who are opposed to the principles set
lurtb in the Chicago platform they will be
found upholding the ticket, just as auybody
e\ae will oppo-e the ticket which ii opposed to
the policies supported by the nominees. But
there is no reason why any soldier who be
lieves in the right of this Nation to have a
financial policy of ita own should oppose any
man named on the Chicago platiorm. My
friends, when I hear these financiers appeal
ing to the soldiers and telling them that the
free coinage of silver would hurt the soldier I
cannot but wonder when the financiers be
came so much interested in the welfare of the
soldiers. [Cheers. A voice: "It's a KepubU
can scheme all the time!"] The soldiers who
went through the war will distinctly remem
ber that when they were out fighting in the
field the financiers were making laws, and
they so made the laws that the man who fur
nished money was paid back iti gold, while
the man who risked his life was paid in green
backs. [Cheers. A voice: "Worth 40 cents
on the dollar."]
The gentleman puegests that they are worth
40 cents on the dollar. He is right The very
men who are now so afraid that the soldier
will draw his pension in 50-cent dollars were
not afraid to pay him for his services in 40
--cent dollars. My friends, if the soldier looks
at the money question, merely from the stand
point of his owu interest he must remember
that his pension is only property Â«nd that if
he legislates the value of the dollar up, while
he raises the purchase power of his pension,
he will increase the value of whatever other
property he has, find it he finds that he can
benefit himselt by raising the purchasing
power of his pension he must remember that
he is condemning his children and his chil
dren's children to the injustice of a gold stan
dard.
The rest of the speech was devoted to a
discussion ot the money question, Mr.
Bryan following his previous lines of argu
ment.
Before starting out to make his night
speech Mr. Bryan was waited on by the
Bryan and Sewall Travelers' Ciub with a
request for a speech. He addressed the
members for a few minutes in the Grand
Hotel. His first speech to-night was from
a stand in Courthouse ParÃ, where 15,000
enthusiastic people gathered. He spoke a
few minutes only and then went to Tom
linson Hall to address a mass-meeting of
workingman. Six thousand was the
audience, packed, jammed and huddled
together. The cheering that greeted the
candidate's entrance lasted fifteen min
utes. In his brief address Mr. Bryan com
plimented Governor Matthews and spoke
of how deeply he had been touched by the
loyalty and devotion of candidates for
the Presidential nomination. He urged
his bearers the necessity of supporting
not only the National ticket, but also the
free silver Congressional candidate, and
not to nejrlect the fight in the selection of
a United States Senator.
Mr. Bryan will leave here at 8 o'clock
in the morning and will end his ludiana
speechmaking at Hammond, where is due
to-morrow night.
BIA CMS WESTERN TOUR
TaTka Confidently of the Sound- Money
Success in the Battle.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct, 6.â William
D. Bynura, chairman of the National Gold
Democratic Committee, expects to return
to Chicago to-night. There was some fur
ther details relat'ng to the organization
that will require his attention at Chicago.
Chairman Bynum, after he has disposed of
them, will make speeches in Indiana, Illi
nois and Michigan. Chairman Hanna
made the following statement to-day in
reference to the political situation :
â¢'Everything is perfectly satisfactory.
Our position 13 strong in the Eas;. It has
been growing stronger every day on the
sound-money question, and the reflection
of that is spreading and exciting its in
fluence all over the country. I have yet
to discover any weak spots as a result of
the second invasion of Bryan. Igo West
fully prepared and ready to meet our op
ponents in the open field of baltic, which
they have chosen for the final contest,
with perfect confidence and assurance as
to the result
"The campaign has been extended. It
now goes into many of the Southern
States, which sive promise of success,
owing to the developed strength of sound
money principles, and this comes irom
the loyal sentiment in that section. Al
though the campaign is more comprehen
sive, it will be, nevertheless, active and
exhaustive because of the importance of
the question and tbe feeling of the people
on the Chicago platform. I go West, be
cause in dividing my time between the
Eastern and Western headquarters it
seems better to be West, during tue Te
mainder of the campaign, inasmuch as
they have stated that the battle ground is
in the middle Western States. The organ
ization of these Eastern headquarters in
point of efficiency and harmony is per
fect and does not seem to need any assist"
ance whidh I can give it.
"It is needless to say that I appreciate
fully how much credit is due to the news
papers of New York, Brooklyn, and, in
fact, the press of the whole East lor the
gratifying condition of affairs in this part
of onr country. Their patriotic course
cannot have failed to create a profound
impression upon the mindsof the people."
Protest Ayaintt Certification.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Oct. 6.â Theodore
Nelson, secretary of the Democratic State
Committee, filed a petition with the Secre
tary of State against the certification of
the independent National Democratic
State ticket. He gives as his reasons that
the law has not Deen complied with ; that
there are not enough names to the peti
tion, and that it is illegally constituted.
The secretary refused to certify. the peti
tion of David Holmes of Mount Erie, the
independent Democratic candidate for
Supreme Court Clerk, and Walter Snook
of Chester County, candidate for Appellate
Court Clerk for the Southern jurisdiction.
He claim:) that their petitions had only
1809 when they should have had 3802
names.
May Not Get On the allot.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Oct. 6.â The State*
and electoral tickets of the sound-money
Democrats mar not get on the Australian
ballot in this State after all. The State
Democratic Executive Committee filed a
protest against admitting the ticket to the
ballot with the State Supervisor of Elec
tions to-day. It is based on the ground
that the name is so similar to the regular
Democratic party that it is likely to give
rise to confusion. There is a State law
against this. Secretary of State Taylor
took the protest under consideration.
Jhinka Hilt Will Support Bryan.
NEW YORK, N.Y., Oct. 6.â Chairman
Danforth reached the Hotel Bartholdi
Democratic headquarters shortly before
noon. He talked freely about bis talk
with Benator Hill. "I am confident,"'
said he,, "that Senator Hill will announce
his intention soon of supporting both
Bryan and Sewall and the State ticket.
Later on in the week I may issue a state
ment that will leave no doubt as to Sen
ator Hill's position."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1896.
SEWALL ACCEPTS
THE NOMINATION
Not at All Backward in
Being Bryan's Run
ning Mate.
Expresses Satisfaction With the
Chicago Platform of the
Party.
FINANCES HIS MAIN THEME-
Says the Peopb Now Facs a Crisis
More S rious Than Any Since
the War.
BATH, Mi., Oct. 6.â The following is
the letter of acceptance of Hon. Arthur
Sewall. Democratic nominee for Vice-
President of the United States:
Bath, Me., Oct 6, 1896.
Hen. Stephen M. White, Chairman and Mevi
hers of the Notification Committee: I have the
honor to accept in writing, ai I have already
verbally done, the nomination tendered by
you on behalf of the Democratic party as its
candidate lor Vice-President of the United
States. And in doing so I am glad, first, to
express my satisfaction that the platform of
our party, which has commanded my llfe-long
allegiance, is honestly and fully declaratory of
all its privileges and especially of the absorb
ing financial Issue upon which, as you say, I
took my stand: ';When the hours of triumph
seemed remote and when arrogant money
changers throughout the world boasted that
the conquest of the American masses was
complete."
These principles have been of late in abey
ance only because those whom we trusted to
maintain them have failed to do so. These
principles can never die. We have rescued
our party from those who, under the influence
of the money power, have controlled and de
based it. Our mission is to now rescue from
this same power and its foreign alliances our
beloved country. This is the first and highest
duty imposed by. our party's platform; upon
the performance" of this duty all other reforms
must wait. The test of party principles is the
government that I desire; the proof of good
government is a contented and happy people,
and the supreme test of both is the ability to
guide the country through a crisis as well as
to administer the Government in ordinary
times.
Our people now face a crisis: a crisis more
serious than any since the war. To what party
shall they turn in their dirs emergency? It is
true that the present crisis may not involve all
equally; that there are those who do not suffer
now, and who may not suffer should the cri>is
threatened by the gold standard come on in
all its fury. Human selfishness makes those
deaf to all apneals, but to these, fortunately,
the Democratic party has never needed to ap
peal to win Its battles; nor does it now, save
as there are some among them who can rise
superior to self in the sacrifice which such a
crisis demands of every patriot. We are told
that the country has prospered under the
present monetary standard; that its wealth
nas enormously increased. Granted. But in
whose bands? In the hands of the toilers, the
farmers, the miners, the fabricators in the
factories, the creators of the Nation's wealth in
peace; its defenders in war?
Have they prosperity, which was theirs so
late as even two years ago? I deny it. I deny !
it. None affirm it save those whose interests j
it iÂ» to do so, whose profits would diminish as ;
prosperity returns to those on whose distress i
they thrive.
A;l is indeed rght between capital and capi
taL Tfce best money in tho world is none too j
good fr.rthose who iiave got it, but how is it I
with the !K) per cent of our people who have
"got it to get?" How is it with those who :
must buy this "best money in the world" with i
the products of their own labor? These are !
I the people for whom the Democratic party i
i would legislate. What 1s the best money for
| these is the question for all to ask who renlly
| love this land. How also can you increase I
j labor* purchasing power but Dy increasing I
! the price of labor's product*?
19 it a fair measure of value that in our great
: producing sections ten bushels vi potatoes
! must be paid for a dollar, ten bushels of oats
' for a dollar, six bushels of corn for a dollar,
i three bushels of wheat and all other products
j oi the soil and mines and the labor of all
| wage-earners at the same ratio ? Does any j
â¢ fair-minded man say ihis is honest money |
| that forces such an exchange, and if it is not j
! a fnir exchange, is it honest, is it less than I
robbery? This is the condition to which the \
single gold standard has brought us. Under it j
the appreciation of the "best money in the |
world" has increased ihe wealth of the rich,
and for the same reason has increased the
dobt of tho creditor, fc'o u:;der the present
standard it must continue to be. With the ob- I
ject K-!-3ons about us, little need have we for
history and statistics and the studies of
scholars. Little satisfaction is it to us that
they have wtrned us long since of the deadly
evil' of the gold standard. It has brought us
at last to the parting of the ways.
Whither shall the people go? In the way
that has led to their enslavement or in that
which offers them their only chance to regain
individual liberty, lasting prosperity and hap
piness? Let not our opponents charge us with
creating clnss distinctions. Alas for the Re
publicans! they are already here, created by
the Republican policy of the last thirty years;
created by the very system we would now
overthrow and destroy. Nor do we raise a
sectional issue. The nomination you tender j
repels the charge. None know better than I
that this nomination is meant as no personal
tribute, but as an assurance that our party is
a non-secUonal party. Not by our policy, but
only by the continuance of the gold standard,
can sectionalism be revived. Neither shall
our opponents be permittsd to terrify the
people by predictions that temporary disturb
ance or panic will come from the policy we
propose. Tbe American people will be loyal
to the Nation's money, will stand behind and
maintain it at whatever value they may them
selves lay upon it.
Once before have our people been called
upon to face a great crisis. What then said
Mr. Lincoln, the chosen leader of the people
of this land? Was he awed by threats or
weakened by pleading* of false friends who
pleaded lor compromise with wrong? His
â  nswer was: "If our sense of duty forbids
thiÃ, then let us stand by our duty fearlessly
and effectively. Let us be diverted by none of
these sophistical contrivances wherewith we
are so Industriously piled and belabored, con
trivances such as groping for some middle
ground between the right and the wrong, re
versing the divine rule and calling not the
sinners but the rigiUeous to repentance, such
as invocations to Washington, imploring men
to say what Washington said aud undo what
Washington did."
Neither let us be slandered from our duty by
faise accusations ageinst us. Let ns have faith
that right makes might, and in that faith to
the end dare to do our duty as we understand
it. We know what the nature of the struggle
is in which we are engaged; we are anxious
only that the people of the land shall under
stand it and then our battle is won. Behind
the strong lntrenchment of the gold standard
are gathered all the hosts of the favored classes
it has fostered, the only dangerous classes of
the land. Avarice and unholy greed are there;
every trust and combination in there; every
monopoly is there, led by the greatest monop-
I oly of all, the monopoly of gold.
With us are tbe unselfish men, who, not suf
fering themselves, cannot rest content with
conditions so full of suffering lor others, and
that vaster number of our people who have
been sacrificed to the smaller selfish class who
now resist their attempts to regain their an
cient rights and liberty. These are the pa
triots of 1896, the foes of a '"dishonest dollar,' 1
which enriches 10 per cent of our people to
rob the rest; the defenders of the homes of the
land, o! public morals and public faith, both
of which aliKe forbid the payment of Govern
ment obligations iv a coin costlier to those
who have to pay than that the contract calls
for; the defenders of the honor Of the Nation,
whose most sacred charge it to care for the
welfare of all ita citizens.
The free and unlimited coinage of silver is
the sole remedy with which to check the
wrongs of to-day; to undo the ruin of the past,
and for our inspiration we have the justice of
our cause and those cherished principles of
Jefferson and Jackson which snail be our
guide on our return to power.
Equal and exact justice to all men, absolute
acq.ulesence ia the direction* Oi tbe majority.
the vital principles of the Republic, the honeit
payment of our debts and sacred preservation
of the public laith.
Profoundly sensible of tbe high honor of the
nomination you tender I am truly years,
Arthur Sbwell.

number constantly sick was 33.89 per
thousand of strength as compared with
34.49 during 1895 and 41.87 as the average
annual rate of the preceding ten years.
Tbe mortality rate from all causes was

HAWKINS GIVEN
THE DECISION
Declared the Victor of Ganz
in a Fifteen-Round
Battle.
But the Baltimore Feather*
Weight Clearly Fought
to a Draw.
SURPRISE AND MUCH DISGUST.
After the Preliminary Bents the Men
Fought Viciously, but the Cali
fornian Was Favored.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 6.-Dal Haw
kins of California was given the decision
over Joe Ganz, the colored feather-weight
of Baltimore, in their fifteen-round battle
at the Bohemian Sporting Club to-night.
Hawkins' supporters were about as mucn
surprised at Referee Kelly's decision as
Ganz' backers were disgusted. The con
test was clearly a draw. Hawkins, who is
a protege of Jim Corbett, had the advan
tage of height and reach over the colored
lad.
After the preliminary bouts were de
cided che main contest was put on at 11:30
o'clock. Hawkins was looked after by
Jim McVey, Corbett's sparring partner,
and Corbett himself sat within coaching
distance of the Caliibrnian's crowd. Ganz
was taken care of by Al Hofferd of Balti
more and Charley White. Hawkins
showed up well, and before the first round
was over it looked any odds on him. He
assumed tbe aggressive at once and fairly
smothered Ganz with heavy left swings
on the face and body. Ganz only landed
twice in the round.
The first part of the second was a repe
tition, and Ganz was winded and nervous,
but recovered somewhat before the bell
rang
The Baltimorean bad a bit the best of
the third. He found a guard for Haw
kins' swinging left and stopped some vi
cious attempts. Joe put in some good
body blows, and botlj were tiring from the
fast pace. In tbe next Ganz had his man's
measure, and keeping well away from
swings he forced the righting and jabbed
bis man hard on the jaw with bis left.
There was some very fast fighting in the
fifth, both exchanging hard body blows.
A hard swing on the jaw made Hawkins
rather dazed as the bell rang.
Hawkins opened the sixth round with a
hard left on tbe ribs, but Ganz retaliated
by jabbing his man four times in succes
sion with lefts in the face. Hawkins' left
ear was bleeding and he clinched hard.
The Californian swung wildly and Ganz
punched him bard. The Californian
steadied himself in the seventh and the
exchanges were even. Both fougnt very
fast at the start of the eighth. Ganz
drove his man's head back with a left on
the chin aad Hawkins came back with a
vicious swing tbat staggered the colored
man.
Hawkins' neck was very raw and red
and bis left eye was swollen. In the ninth
and tenth rounds the fighting was even,
both countering with lefts. Neither used
tbn right with any effect.
Ganz started in as if to finish his man
in tbe eleventh, but Hawkins came back
well. Hawkins was wild and tbe colored
lad let three or four openings pass by
badly. Hawkins got in some stinging
body blows in tbe twelfth, but Ganz evened
up matters with left jabs on the face.
Hawkins came up for the thirteenth
swinging his left in all directions, but
Ganz avoided him neatly and jabbed him
bard on the body and jaw. It was Ganz'
round.
There was a lot of vicious in-fighting in
the fourteenth, of which Ganz had the
best. Hawkins swung a swift left that
found an opening on tbe jaw. Ganz re
turned with a corking left on tbe jaw that
sent Hawkins staggering across the ring,
but the Baltimore boy was fresh.
Tbe last round was a fast one. Dal
dashed George to the ropes and sent in a
left on the face, but the latter came back
smiling and jabbsd his man several times.
Thpy were fighting when the bell rang.
Most of the spectators had moved
toward tbe doors, thinking there would
be only one decision, and tbe astonish
ment was universal when the referee's
fiat was announced. Many of the spec
tators thought that GÂ»nz should have
been given the decision, but the bout was
clearly and unmistakably a draw.

REPUDIATION MEANS EUIN
Delegations to the Shrine of Reput>
licanism Told of the Blunders
of Democrats.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 6.âNotwithstand
ing the inclement weather viking delega
tions to the shrine of republicanism to
day heard Major McKinley's words of wel
come and utterances on the issues of the
campaign, but the tabernacle had to be
used instead of the porch of the candi
date's house. Tbe first delegation that
arrived was from East Brady, Pa. Major
McKinley addressed it in part as follows:
One thing I tniuk we are sometimes too apt
to forgetâ we are too apt to forget what is be
hiud us, too apt to be heedless of our own ex
perience. Wo can hardly realize that from
1573 to 1893 we reduced the Dublic debt
from $2,333,331, 308 to $570,000,000. We
paid off during those twenty years $1,623,581,
--671 oi the public debt. And we were under a
protective and sound money system when we
were making large payments. Two-thirds of
that great debt disappeared, and while we
were paying it off we were building up in this
country the most splendid industrial enter
prises, giving constant, steady employment to
American labor.
Now, my fellow citizens, four years ago the
people of this country determined to change
its policy. They did change it. What has
been the result? We Lave since that time
created a National debt, principal and inter
est, of ab.mt $300,000,000; we have had for
the greater part of that time a deficiency tn
the treasury, the Government not collecting
sufficient revenues to meet its current
expenses. Labor has been unemployed.
If we will but follow the lamp of
experience, following in the direction
in which the light of that lamp leads us, on
the 3d day of November we will vote down
the policies which have brought us these con
ditions and vote to continue a monetary sys
tem, built udoii a solid basis, which will give
us the best money in the worldâ a money
which panics cannot disturb and business
iailures cannot depreciate. We want good
times, plenty of work, good wages and good
money. How will you vote? I thank you
most heartily for this call, and bid you all
good morning.
At 3 o'clock a delegation of 950 lumber
men from Buffalo and Tonawanda arrived
on a special train. To them the candidate
said, after quoting extensively from sta
tistics relating to the lumber industry and
the benefits it derived from the protective
tariff:
I am in favor of encouraging our shipping
interests in every proper and suitable way. and
I am in lavor of the restoration of a tariff sys
tem which builds up home factories, home
markets and home trade and which makes this
wonderful international commerce of oura
possible. [Great cheering.] For the past three
years we have contributed something to build
up maufacturiiig in the cities of Europe,
which is well enough if we had no idle men at
home [great laughter and applause], and
while we have been doing this we have cor
respondingly been doing something to drag
down manufacturing in the United States and
doing good to our foreign relatives to our own
injury; helping foreign markets by surren
dering our own markets and getting nothing
by the process. Is that business? [Cries of
"No!']
In common with other good citizens you are
concerned in the proper settlement of the free
coinage question. [A voice, "We will settle it
all right," followed by great laughter and ap
plause.] Did you ever reflect how it wou4
help the prices of real estate and buildings to
have a.l values unsettled and the validity of
contracts thrown into jeopardy? The history
of the world proves that real estate suffers
most severely In every period of financial dis
tress and of all property it recovers the most
slowly. Read the history of the great finan
cial depressions and panics of 1825, 1837,
1841, 1857, 1873, 1878, 1893 and 1896 and
gee it this U nut true. The triumph of sound
money and protection at the polls in November
will, in my judgment, restore confidence and
thereby help every species of business, and
when that is done your business will share in
the general advancement and profit by the
general prosperity. [Great applause.]
The next delegation to arrive was from
Syracuse, N. Y. They came at 5 o'clock
and marched throngh the driving rain to
Major McKinley's house and then to the
Tabernacle, where the candidate addressed
them in part as follows:
In common with Republicans everywhere
this year you show an ardent interest in the
pending campaign, of which yet only four
â weeks remain. The campaign of 1894 was
peculiarly a campaign of the peopleâ then
they expressed themselves for the first time
after the campaign of 1892. Their verdict
was an impressive protest against the tariff
legislation of a Democratic Congress. Men of
Syracuse, have you changed your opinion of
thÃt legislation since then? [Loud cries of
"No! no!"] The same question is prosented
now with the added one which involves the
character of our country and the inviolability
of our credit. Ii the free trade policy of the
Democratic Congress merited (as I think
justly) the condemnation you gave it, how
much greater must be your vote of protest and
disapproval when it is coupled with the prop
osition to enter upon the free and unlimited
coinage of the silver of the world.
The people of New York naturally are most
deeply concerned as to the outcome of the
latter ipsue, possessing db tney do nearly
$600,000,000 in their savings banks, $300,
--000.000 in United States insurance companies,
aud $700,000,000 in the capital and loans of
your State and National basks, in addition to
your other forms of property, in all of which
they would suffer immense loss if we should
enter upon an era of dishonest and depreci
ated currency. Greatly as you have suffered
in your business enterprises by the tariff
policy which has prevailed for tbe past three
years the new issue would still further entail
los 6 and injury, and is a change, I believe, that
our people will not tolerate lor an instant, as
they value their material interests and the
honor of this great Nation. [Great applause
and cries of "No, never."]
Property and investments are dear to all of
them, but I am fully persuaded now, as so
many times in tbe past, neither would weigh
in the balance with love of country whenever,
wherever and however its honor may be as
sailed. As the allied parties in opposition are
urging this question, it is not a proposition
for the free coinage of both gold and silver,
but practically that of silver alone, and not
silver by international agreement, for to that
they are not opposed, but solemnly, exclusively
and defiantly if you please, the free, indepen
dent and unrestricted coinage of the -ilver of
the world, regardless of consequences and
despite the certain distress and ruin in which
it would involve us all. [Applause]
A voiceâ "We don't want free silver." [Ap
plause.]
Considerations of prudence, a faithful regard
lot obligations aud proper respect for the rights
of our citizens as individuals, are all left out
of the question, and we are blindly to follow
wherever tbey may dare to lead.
It Is not a leap in the dark, for we lspow
from sad experience what a depreciated cur
rency means to every invested interest; what
it means to wages, to labor and to property; to
credit and to the country itself. Ignoring all
existing conditions among the great commer
cial nations of :he world and the requirements
of sound finances, obvious to every considera
tion of prudence, care, thrift and National in
tegrity, their proposition would engulf us in a
system of absolute silver monometallism, for
they are themselves the only unconditional
and unqualified mouometallists iv the United
States. Our policy insures the use of ooth gold
and silver at an equality. They seek to drive
us to silver alone. They advocate what they
call financial independence, and in the name
of independence ther appeal to us to debase
our currency and repudiate in part or whole
all our debts and sully our National honor.
This we decline forever to do. [Great ap
plause.]
This is not the character of inde
pendence which the American people
love and sustain and are accustomed
to exercise. It is independence with
honor to which we hold, independence
to which attaches a taint of dishonor. We
would not want that distinction at any price,
[cries of "Right, right."] It is neither digni
fied nor justified in public debate that we in
dulge in harsh names. I; is not becoming to
any to do it, nor does it help the cause which
they espouse. 1 prefer to treat my fellow
citizens aa being honest in their convictions
and desirous of what they believe will pro
mote the public welfare, convinced that if
they are wrong they will eventually espouse
tne right, when at last thoy see the right. It
is their intelligence we scet: to reach; It is
their sober Judgment we invoke; it is their
patriotism to which we appeal. It is to per
suade not to abuse, which is the rightful ob
ject of discussion. In that spirit I address my
fellow-citizens and abjure to reflect before
they add dishonor to our credit or our cur
reacy. Let the words or the reverend states
man of all parties of the past dissuade them
from putting any stain upon, the financial and
hitherto good name of this Republic. [Great
applause.]
A delegation from Kewanee, Mich.,
fhimberint; 500, marched into the hall as
the Syracuse visitors left. The Michigan
men were stalwart farmers and they made
the auditorium ring with their lusty
cheers. When silence had been restored
:<e said:
To me the contention for protection is from
first to last a plea for labor und the agricul
tural interests of the United States. [Great
cheering.l I: is a recognition of the men who
toil, whether in the factory or on the farm, and
an effort ior their advancement and coastaut
betterment, We want in this country none of
the harsh and degraded conditions on the free
silver in America that prevail in some coun
tries. [Cries of "No, no," and applause.] And
we do not mean to have them, because unlike
other Governments of the world, this Govern
ment rests upon the consent of the governed.
[Tremendous applause.] We have no place for
the laws of caste or primogeniture and want
none of their artificial conditions of btrth and
society in our matchless civilization. [Ap
plause.]
The door of opportunity swings open to the
honest, Inaustrions workingman, as well as to
those of every other condition. [Cries of
"That's right!"] They talk about our being a
deotor nation, and because we are a debtor
nation they want us to repudiate our debts.
[Loud cries of "No, never!"] That sentiment,
my fellow-citizens, will never meet with the
indorsement of a majority of the American
people. [Applause.]
In the evening the Syracuse Republican
escort, bearing colored flambeaux and fol
lowed by the delegation from that city
and by all the uniformed campaign clubs
of Canton, marched up to Major McKin
ley's residence and were reviewed by him.
The visitors were cordially applauded
along tne line of march, and they made
the most effective night parade that has
been witnessed here.
Among Major McKinley's caller? to-day
was A. M. Hig.-ins, president of the Amer
ican ljeacue Clubs of Indiana. Mr. Hig
gins told Major McKiniey Indiana would
give him a plurality exceeding 150,000.
FOR A VIGOROS CAMPAIGN
Republican Leader* to Labor in Douht
ful States.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 6.â There was
quite a number of callers to-day at Repub
lican headquarters. Mr. Hanna left for
Chicago this evening and in all probability
will not return until after election day.
Mr. Hanna was early at headquarters to
day, and during the morning finished up
the campaign work that required his per
sonal attent on.
The executive committee held a meet
ing this afternoon and Mr. Hanna and his
associates discussed the political situation
in detail. A vigorous campaign will, it is
said, be carried on in all the doubtful
States, and every inch of ground will be
fought over.
LARGE REPUBLICAN GAINS.
Town Election* in Connecticut Show the
Drift of Sentiment.
HARTFORD, Conn., Oct. 6.â The town
elections held in this Statb yesterday show
large Republican gains over 1895, larger
than those of 1894. Of the 1602 towns that
voted last year 98 were Republican, 28
Democratic and 36 divided. There were
162 towns which voted yesterday, all ex
cept Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven,
Ansonia, Derby and Naugatuck. The
results so far as can be learned indicate
that of these 162 towns 113 are Republican,
18 Democratic and 16 divided. There is
Republican gains of 16 towns. The only
Republican loss was in Litchfield County.
The Florida Election.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. 6.â The
election in Florida to-day passed off
quietly, but the meager returns so far re
ceived indicate that a very light vote was
cast. Only very meager returns are be
ing received as the count is exceedingly
slow owing to tne length oi the ballot.
All the returns will not be in before to
morrow or next day, but estimates to
night place the Democratic majority at
less than 20,000.
Gnod Sew* From JUcGraw.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 6.â John H.
McGraw, Governor of the State of Wash
ington, in a letter to Assistant Secretary
Perkins says: "Our friends are very con

elect our State ticket, but also give our
electoral vote to McKiniey."

secretary, Thurb?r, left at daylight on the
steam yacht Oneida as guests of Commo

Ruth, Estoer and Marion left on the cars.
The President will cruise along the sound

Washington, via the Pennsylvania Rail
road. He expects to arrive in the latter
city either Thursday or Friday.

IN A LONDON PRISON.
Walter M. Castle, Wife and Son
Accused of Having Stolen
Furs.
Colonel Castle, Brother of the Accused,
Says the Charge Mast Be a
Mistake.
LONDON. Eng.. Oct. 6.â Walter Michael
Castle, who claims to be an American
merchant; Ella Castle, his wife, and Fred
Castle, his son, 10 years old, were arrested
to-day at tbe Hotel Cecil and were cnarged
at the Police Court with stealing several
sable and chinchilla skins, of a total value
of $105, from furriers of this city.
Evidence was presented that the pris
oners bad entered the shops, and after ex
amining the furs went out without buying
any. Immediately after the proprietors
misled the goods the Castles had exam
ined.
The police say they found in the rooms
occupied by the Castles at tbe hotel sev
eral trunks marked "Mrs. William Castle,
San Francisco" and "Mr. Walter Castle,"
which contained the missing furs, much
jewelry and some old hand-painted china.
Mrs. Castle, when taken into custody, said :
"We bought most of the things in Ge
neia and one Saturday we bought from a
booth in the street."
The prisoners were remanded for a
week, bail being refused, and the boy was
discharged.
In reference to the npws that Walter M.
Castle, his wife and child, have been put
in jail in London on a charge of theft,
Colonel Albert E. Castle said last night:
"This must all be a mistake. No one
who knows Walter will believe any soch
statement. If Walter is in jail there is
some misunderstanding about the matter.
Ido not believe that there is anything to
it or I would have received a personal dis
patch from him, but I have not had such
a dispatch. Walter was to have started
for home with his family to-morrow."
Walter M. Castle is a member of the
firm of Castle Bros. He has always been
known as a man of high character and is
exceptionally popular, for many amiable
qualities, all over the Pacific Coast. He
has also been noted for public spirit and
enterprise, being one of the foremost
young business men of San Francisco.
He has been abroad upon a vacation.

, One Property Owner Can Prevent an Ob
jectionable Tin tine mm.
DES MOINES, lowa, Oct. 6.â An impor-
I tant decision was handed down to-day in
the District Court. George Rohl, a saloon
keeper, was enjoined from opening his
place because a\j property-owner within
fifty ' feet - had objected. When "? Rohl
opened the saloon a year ago he had the
consent of all property-owners as required
by law. One of ; them .afterward , changed
bis ; mind ; and asked for I the ? injunction.
The case was fought, and the court held
that i at-; saloon J man ' had no protection
against such contingencies. Kohl held a
long lease of his room and bad his liquor
tax paid ;in advance, but without any re
course !on \ those - accounts ! he ' must close.
Several other cases of the same kind will
be commenced at once, property-owners
in the business part of town being of the
opinion the ': saloon* hurt * their > property
and business. v :t The Rohl ,:. case will be
taken to the Supreme Court. 'â Â"

Survivors of the Willie Rosenfeld Tell of
the Vessel's Loss in a
Heavy Gale.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 6 âOn the
steamer Carib Prince, which arrived this
morning from Rio de Janeiro, were Mate
E. H. Gillespie and wife, Steward Burn
ham and his wife, who was the stewardess'
and a cabin boy of the wrecked ship
Willie Rosenfeld, which left here on April
23 last for San Francisco. Mate Gillespie
tells this story :
Two days aftar leaving New York
Charles Simpson of New Jersey cut his
thioat. They jjot along well until on Julyll,
in latitude 58 south, longitude 60 west, a
.southwest gale and tremendous sea struck
them. The vessel sprang a leak and they
could barely keep her free. On the morn
ing of the 18th of August there was four
and a half feet of water in her hold and it
was decided to leave her.
They began work on the boats and by 9
o'clock next morning were clear of the
ship. Two and a half hours afterward
they saw her sink.
The first boat was commanded by Mate
Gillespie, and contained Captain Dunphy,
Mrs. Gillespie, steward, stewardess, car
penter, boatswain and five seamen. The
second boat was commanded by Second
Mate Baldwin and contained six sailors.
Two ol the men who shipped as A. B.s
were Englishmen named Ro*s. They
were sons of an English barrister, who
had bought a fruit ranch for them in Cali
fornia, and they were on their way to
take charge of it.
The third boat was in charge of Third
Mate Smith, formerly a Columbia River
fisherman, and contained nix sailors.
The boats soon got separated, bnt the
first boat and one other landed, which
one Gillespie had been unable to find out.
By 11 o'clock on this day it was blowing a
gale and the boats nearly capsized before
they hove to and took in sail.
The gale lasted about thirty hours. The
women suffered very much. They first
sighted land ninety-nine miles out of
Imbetiba, Brazil, and could see tbe people
on the beach, but could not land on ac
count of the breakers. They finaily landed
at Imbetiba in the afternoon of August 19.
MANY HOUSES WASHED AWAY.
Hundreds of Lives Lost During the
Floods in Mexico.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 6â A special to a
morning paper from Guadalajara, Mex.,
says: Overland advices received here from
the port at Mazatlan state that the damage
wrought by the recent floods in the State
of Sinaloa was much greater than at first
estimated. All tbe rivers in that State
were over their banks, and a number
of villages and farmhouses were washed
away. Over 100 bodies have been recov
ered and many others are missing.
The damage to shipping in this vicinity
is believed to be very great, but as yet re
ports as to the safety of coast vessels are
very meager. A full report of the damage
done has been forwarded to President
Diaz, and n public appeal will be made for
funds to relieve the wants of the storm
sufferers.

HOLOCAUST AT SUMMIT,
Entire Family Burned to Death
in the Little Oregon
Village.
Charred Corpses of Mrs- Savage and
Her Three Children Found
in A-hes.
Â«
ALBANY, Or., Oct. 6.â News was re
ceived here to-day of a shocKing tragedy
that took place Sunday evening near the
town of Summit, in Benton County. A
whole family was burned to death, and
none of the neighbors knew of the disaster
until the next morning.
On Sunday afternoon Mrs. Tom Savage,
living near Summit, went to call on her
neichbors, the Thrashers, and left their
house to return to her own home, not far
away, early in the evening. A little later
a neighbor passing her house saw her in
the;vard cuttinu kindling wood, appar
ently preparing for the evening meal. Still
later, about 8 o'clock, a neighbor passing
the house noticed that everything
about it was quiet, and that the lights
were out.
On the follow ing morning Bert James,
driving along the roaa, discovered that the
house had been burned. He went over to
view the ruins, and found that there were
several blackened bodies in the ashes.
An investigation was begun and the
body of Mrs. Savage was found in the
ruins beneath where her bed had stood.
Near by w:is the charred corpse of a young
baby. Upon a wire mattress lay the re
mains of the two Savage boys, burned to
a crisp. They had apparently been
smothered, as there were no signs of a
strug'-le. An ax lay on the floor in the
middle of the room.
The cause of the fire is unknown, and
the affair is regarded by the neighbors as
mysterious. The discovery of the ax on
the floor has caused suspicion that the
fire may have been preceded by foul play.
STAGE ROBBERY
AT CRIMEA HILL
Mail From Chinese Camp
Captured by a Lone
Outlaw.
Finds but a Single Money Order
Jo Repay Him for His
Risk.
PASSENGERS NOT MOLESTED.
Wells-Fargo's Treasure Box Is Taken,
but It Contained Nothing of
Va ue.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 6.-ThÂ« stage
that runs between Chinese Camp and
Knights Ferry was stopped an an early
hour this morning by alone highwayman.
The stage had five passengers â four men
and a woman. As it neared Crimea Hill,
midway between Chinese Camp and
Cloudman, the driver heard the com
mand "halt" from the side of the road.
Haying previously looked down the bar
rels of a shotgun he did not hesitate, but
pulled up immediately.
The coach was going up grade at the
time and the robber stepped from behind
a tree as it came up to him. It was dark
and all tbe driver could see wax that the
highwayman held a glistening revolver in
one hand. The robber ordered the ex
press and mail matter thrown out, and
this was done with alacrity. Then the
highwayman ordered the stage-driver to
start the horses, and he did so without
further ceremony.
The passengers in the sta^e were much
frightened, but the highwayman did not
attempt to molest them, being content
with what he thought he would get out of
the mail and express packages.
As soon as it became light the Postmaster
at Cloudman drove out to the scene of the
hold-up and found that tbe mail pouch
had been rifled. The letters were scat
tered over the ground about the empty
pouch, and a registered letter containing
$65 was mi-sing. This seems to be all
that the highwayman got for his pains,
as a later investigation showed that he
got nothing of value from the Wells,
Fargo & Co.'s box.
It has been the custom, since tbe hold
ups of tbe past year, to invariably send a
shotgun messenger with every stage that
contained anything of value, and, as
there was no coin to be sent from Chinese
Camp to Knights Ferry, no measeneer
was sent. There is little doubt but that this
is the same man who stopped the Chinese
Camp stage on two former occasions.
In each instance he got very little plun
der. The detectives in the employ of
Wells, Fargo & Co. were confident after
the last holdup that they knew the
identity of the outlaw, but they have evi
dently not been able to locate him. After
the second robbery a number of the de
tectives in the employ of the express com
pany were in Stockton looking ior the
highwayman to show himself here, but
tbey went away disappointed, as he kept
to the woods.
Every effort is now being made by the
authorities to catch the lone highway
man, and as be has secured very little
plunder he is not likely to go far from his
haunts.

and arrested a Chinaman found hiding in
a Chinese bunkhouse. He denied having
had anything to do with the shooting, but

man arrested, is one of the men who hela
him while Quong shot him.
TROUBLE IN THE COUNCIL.
Investigation of Alleged Shady Trans

BAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 6.â The meetine
of the Common Council this evening had
an unexpected feature. Mayor Koch called
attention to a claim against the city for

BUM'S FOES AT VALLEJO
Good Templars' Grand Lodge of
Cal if or it a in Annual
Session.
Absence of Ministers From the Order
Deplored â New Ledges
Instituted.
VALLEJO, Cal., Oct. 6.â The Grand
Lodge of California, Independent Order of
Good Templars, convened in thirty
seventh annual session in this city to-day,
Rev. J. W. Webb of Frssno, grand worthy
chief templar, presiding.
The Grand Lodge degree was conferred
on thirteen past officers, A letter was re
ceived from Past Grand Chief Templar
Hoag, announcing his inability to attend
the opening session owing to tbe death of
his wife. Resolutions of condolence were
passed and ordered transmitted to him.
The report of the grand chief templar
was submitted at tbe fotenoon session.
He regretted greatly that a gain in mem
bershin could not be reported. Though
the officers had striven to build up the
order, other religious temperance societies
bad drawn largely from the Good Temp
lars. Comparatively few preachers worked
in the ranks, though all were for temper
ance. They prayed for it, some worked
for it, but they did not join the lodges.
He recommended rousing educational
meetings and personal attention to juve
nile work. The grand chief templar also
recommended Unit a beneficiary feature
be attached to the order: that tbe number
of lady managers ar.il trustees of the
Orphans' Home be considerably reduced,
in the interest of harmony and efficiency,
and that the elective members of such
boards be carefully chosen, with a special
view to their experience and fitness rather
than their distribution over the State or
their personal popularity.
The Rescue, the official paper, is poorly
patronized and a recomniencintion is made
that the columns of some weekly temper
ance paper be utiliz?d. Women are wel
comed into the order and the Prohibition,
Populist, National and Republican parties
are complimented for advocating woman
suffrage. The grand chief templar urges
all men to vote for the party that has the
best temperance plank in its platform.
The grand secretary's report shows a
membership of 4226. Number of lodges
120. Eighteen new lodges were instituted
within a year and it is hoped the down
ward course has been checked. During
the year there has been a loss of 1161 mem
bers and a gain of 293. making a net loss
of 868. The loss so far this j ear is-198.
Dr. Oronhyatekba, past grand chief tem
plar of the world, visited the Grand Lodge
this afternoon and made an interesting
address.
During the day a resolution was intro
duced by Judge Thompson declaring that
in the opinion of this Grand Lodge the
time had come to consider t-.e advisability
of forming a corporation under which to
conduct the business of the Good Tem
plars' Home for Orphans, and resolving
that for that purpose a committee of seven
be appointed to consider the same and re
port on Wednesday at the opening of the
afternoon session. The purport of the
resolution is that in the future no'debt can
be saddled on the home. An effort is to
be made to counteract the impression that
the orphans' home is exclusively for or
phans of Good Templars, when, as is the
fact, it is open to all orphans.

SAN BERNARDINO'S
MURDER MYSTERY
Mrs. Rodriguez Confesses
to the Killing of a
Mexican.
Declares That She Brained the
Man to Protect Her
Honor.
HER STORY IS NOT CREDITED.
Officials Believe That the Woman
Seeks to Shield the R al
Assassin.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Oct. ftâ
Mrs. Vircinia Rodriqucz killed a Mexican
named Manuel Monjarro this morning.
The woman gave the alarm herself and
the police were quickly on the premises.
They found Monjarro's body lying in a
pool of blood with his skull crushed.
The woman admitted that she had done
the killing, but declared it was in defense
of her hor.or. She claimed that after she
had retired tbe man came to the back
door of her house and demanded that it be
opened, or he would break it down.
Finally she opened the door and was con
fronted by Monjarro with a razor in his
hand. She pushed him over, seized an ax
and crushed his skull.
The story of the woman is not believed
in certain quarters and tbe officials are in
vestigating. It is intimated that another
man is mixed up in the affair and that the
woman's story was conceived to shield the
real murderer. The Coroner is also taking
a hand in the endeavor to arrive at the
facts and this afternoon that officer re
fused to proceed with the inquest claim
ing that he had received information
which if found correct would place an en
tirely different aspect on the mysterious
affair.

The Ohio orator was in baJ trim, his voice
being husky and showing the effect of
over use, but he held, his hearers by his
apt and ingenious manner of putting, his

1 never forget wherever I go in this broad

should not give her electoral vote to XVilliam
McKinley. 1 have talked with Republicans,
Democrats. Populists aud Prohibitionists, in
cluding the Chicago wing of the Democracy
and ihe Indianapolis wiag, and not a man
hnve I met who liÂ»s said that the election of
Bryan would prosper any institution in the

1; there is auv State in the Union that con
tains institutions of which Mr. MeKinley is
the especial ch&aipion, California is that
Mate. There is no Mate to which he Is not de
voted. You have a promising city here; but
what makes it promising but your agricultural
and manufacturing interests?â all of which
are suffering as the result of your judgment
four years ago in accenting the cffÂ«r of the
Democratic party that it would improve ex
isting conditions if given the opportunity.
I am not here to war against the individual
citizen, whether Democrat, Populist or Pro
hibitionist. But I would say of the Prohibi
tionists that if -the world "gets much worse
they cannot succeed, and it it gets better their
services will not be required, t Applause.] I
would advise them to pitcu their tents
with us.
Democrats as loyal and patriotic &< any
American citizens have told you that if you

their honesty, but their wisdom. We in 1896
are here to pass in review upon what they
did. We have felt the stripes and know our
conditions. Men do not gather graDes or rigs
from thistles, and I hold that we cannot
gather figs from Populist thistles. And where
ever the Democrats have succeeded prosperity
has folded its tent and gone irom the borders

If there is a State anywhere that should
champion the principles of MeKinley it is
California. You cannot afford 10 " strike

From shop to shop, from flock to Cock, trom

that bill. Now. the question is* whether we
shall let the same party fool us twice. If a
man fools me once, it's his fault: and if he
fools me twice, it's my fault. [Applause.]
Mr. Butterworth then turned his atten
tion to finances. He said that this country
in 1861-63 tried to place a stamp on paper
money and declare it to be worth some
thing, but though the promise was writ
ten in the blood of patriots, that mooev
steadily sank m value until it reached 35
cents on the dollar. -No law, he claimed,
could make something worth more than
it would be worth under the higher and
immutable law of supply and demand.
He said he was a friend of silverâ as
good a friend as it had. He was also a
friend of common-sense. He did not pro
pose to commit suicide in November for
fear of dying in March. He said this
country had kept the silver dollar worth a
dollar, by guaranteeing to redeem it. The
whole power of the Government was be
hind it. The countries of the world were
becoming convinced that silver must be
remonetized, and the Republican party
was anxious to act with tÂ» em. But the
United States could not afford to make
itself the sacrifice to determine for the
profit of other nation.*, whether a country
could by its fiat defy the laws of supply
and demand. The price of gold, like
wheat, tobacco, cotton, silver, or any other
material thing, was regulated beyond the
power of Congress or Parliament.
Chairman Reed introduced Senator
George C. Perkins. Mr. Perkins was loudJy
cheered when he arose to speak. lie has
spoken in San Diego before, and he met in
tae audience many of his old friends. He
began by reviewing ihe present condition
of the country under a tariff for revenue
only ana what it was under the McKinley
protective law. when every industry in the
country was flourishing. * Said he:
The Republican party Is the exemplar of
protection to ihe industries, to the labor, to
ihe homes of America. It believes in the pro
tection of labor, which is the foundation of
â¢k e*lth. It believes ia taxing the luxuries
which are brought to this country. The Dem
ocratic bill for revenue should be called a de
ficiency bill (laughter], beaeause we hare run
behind under i:s operation $202,000,000
during the last three years. The people have
paid during that time $9,000,000 per year as
interest on bonds.
There was a great surplus in the treasury
when Harrison slipped out, and the Dam<>
cra:s Â«.'Te murh concerned. "Why," tisey
cried, '"somebody is iosing tliÂ« interest on all
this io: of id!e money." Well, they can't com
plain now. (Lauehter and cheers.]
Daring the Harrison administration we not
ocly raised enough to keep going but we re
duced the puplic debt by $250,000,000. The
Democratic bill has not only not kept us out
of debt but it has discriminated ariirm parts
of the country, particularly ag&inst C*li
lornia. The leaders have said. "Here, we
must protect the paper-dollar industry be
cause a distinguished Senator from New York
&ays we must, or lose his support; but we will
hit the raisin industry of San Diego Coon ty.
California. . We must keep up the tariff on
morocco lest her because New Jersey men of
influence are Interested in its manufacture â¢
but we will strike down the wool industry of
California.
Senator Perkins devoted the latter part
of his address to the monetary question.
He held that the Republican party was
the true friend of silver, and that no effort
to inflate that metal or 10 give it a ficti
tious value would be a move in its favor.
It would rather retard its march to a place
of parity with go!d.> He closed with a
strong appeal to his hearers to stand by
the glorious Republican partyâ the party
with a history of noble deeds performed,
of promises kept and of courage to fight
now for the people's interests. â

w During the ' afternoon session the grange
j listened to an ; able â¢ speech -. by Master W.
, W. Greex on matters pertaining to the
advancement and interests of the farming
community throughout -, the ; State. Re
garding the flax-raising industry he said :
Four years ago a creditable i: effort was made
to place vegetable fiber culture on a profitable
basis in this State. ?-. Much was wriuea - and
said; experiments were made in growing flax,
hemp and ramie, which * so- encouraged those
interested a* to lead to the passage of a bill
through the Legislature appointing a superin
tendent of ramie culture under the direction
of the State Board of Agriculture. s-~ "â¢ - r
yt From causes which in no way reflected upon%
those esgarea is promoting tat 'â  industry or
suggest its impracticability, the effort I to do
anything in a public way was abandoned after
seed had been distributed. * few farmers
assisted in making an experiment, inventors
induced to attempt the construction of ma
chines suitable fur working up the raw mate
rials, and the importation of a complete mill
for utilizing the various libers.
As a result of the work done at that time we
now learn from reliable sources that there
were planted the present year 3000 acres of
flax, 300 acres of hemp and eigbty acres of
ramie. Machines have been invented that
will enable us to work up the raw material at
a great profit, provided suflic.ent quantities
are produced iv any given section.
A iew enterprising men have carried this
important industry past the experimental
sta^e and deiuouMrated that Â«t lenst three
varieties oi vegetable fibers can be success
fully grown and worked into manufactured
articles equal to those produced in any part of
the world.
We are led to believe that the reason fiber
culture has made no greater progress lies in
the fact that there are three distinct branches
or departments that must be simultaneously
developed upon a sufficiently large scale to
attract attention in order that either may be
come a commercial succe^.
(1) The farmers must grow enoueh of the
raw material in certain localities to justify
(Si the inventors or manufacturers of ma
chines in building and operating perfected im
plements for separating the Tiber from the
stalk and f3) to induce capital to construct
factories for manufacturing the finished fab
rics.
All three of these arj being done in a limited
way, but as capital is always excessively shy
of any new departure, and as it would be diffi- (
colt, if not impossible, for the farmers to make
an organized effort, we would suggest that the
State should again be persuaded to lend Its aid
by an appropriation to be used in developing
the three branches and In bringing them to
gether in such a way aa to make them mutu
ally helpful._
WOMEN WANT NEW LAWS,
The Women's Federation Will
Act to Secure Better
Legislation.
A Strong Effort Is to Be Hade to Se
cure the Conviction cf Peter
Lane.
At the meeting of the Women's State
Federation Monday the code committee
was instructed to give especial attention
to an eSort to amend laws relating to
women and children, some of which they
consider most defective. A special meet
ing of the committee is to be held this
week, to outline a plan of work. The fol
lowing ladies comprise the committee:
Mrs. Eva Bates, Miss Lila May Kimball,
Mrs. Rose French, Mrs. M. Ackley. Mrs." E.
M. Worth, Mrs. Dr. Janes, Mrs. K. Atken,
Mrs. J. Payne. Mrs. J. Griffith, Mrs.
Neilie Blessing Eyster.
The women of the federation have en
tered a charge of misdemeanor against
Pe:er Lane, one of the old men connected
with the scandalous North Beacn cases.
It was resolved yesterday to present this
charge as strongly as possible, in order
that Lane may be punisbed to the utmost
rigor of the law of misdemeanor, which
means six months in prison.
Miss Rose French stated that Meyers
; wilt plead guilty when his case comes up.
; She alÂ«o stated tnat Carroll Cook has
' withdrawn from defending the old men
connected with the North Beach scandals.
Tbe federation decided to adopt a button
for its badge. The metal was not decided
â  upon, but it wilt probably be either silver
i or copper.
The house of refuge committee was
! stated to be hard at work looking out for a
j suitable location. The ladies are anxions
I to make a beginning no matter how
: humbie and it is probable that a location
, will soon be secured.

Two Men Are Killed Outright
and Five Dangerously
Injured.
FRIGHTFUL CBASH AT A CUEYE
The Locomotives Were Started With
out Proper Orders, to Rectify
a Conductor's Error.
GRANTS PASS, Or., Oct 6.â Two wild
j engines running without orders on the
Southern Pacific between Koseburg and
Dillards collided in a dense fog on a enrve
half a mile from Greens station at 6:30
o'clock this morning. John McGonigle of
Portland, firerran of the southbound
engine, ana Albert N. Toish of Salem, a
brakeman who was on the engine, were
instantly killed. Five trainmen were
badly injured. They are: James Porter,
engineer on tne northbound engine,
severely bruised and one ankle broken;
George Happersette, fireman on the north
bound engine, both legs broker and feet
crushed, rendering amputation of one leg
below the knee and the other foot neces
sary ; Benjamin Lohr, head and face cut;
Fred Wall, conductor, on Porter's engine,
bruised and cut about face and bead;
Engineer McCalley, badly bruised.
Conductor Wall of the overland bound
for San Francisco accidentally left his
tickets and papers at Roseburg this morn
ing. He could not well proceed without
tnem, so be sidetracked at Dillards and
taking his engine started back to that city.
In the meantime Conductor Wall's papers
were discovered by the station agent at
Roseburg and tbe train-dispatcher orderect
out a light engine to overtake the overland
about Myrtle Creek keeping a lookout for
No. 10 and section men.
The morning was densely foggy and
while rounding a curve the engines
crashed into each other. Both were going
at full speed and traveling backward. So
great was tne force of the impact that ail
the occupants were thrown into the air
and the two tenders wrecfied. Tigh and
McGonigle were instantly killed.
Engineer Porter had reversed his engine
before being thrown from the cab. The
locomotive broke from the tank and ran
southward a couple of miles, where it was
found exhausted. Tde tanks of both en
gines were oediy demolished.
The first news of tne accident was
brought to town by a farmeron horseback.
Division Snperintendent Fields, who ar
rived this morning from Portland, went
immediately to the scene of the wreck
with physicians and brought back the in
jnred men, returning with a Coroner. The
Coroner's jury heard some evidence this
atternoon, and, owing to the condition of
the injured men, adjourned the hearing
until to-morrow morning.
FIRES IN THE SIERRA MADRE.
. Futile Attempts to Stay the Progress of
the Flames â An Appeal for
Assistance.
PASADENA, Cal, Oct. 6. â Flames
| along the top of Browns Mountain,
i plainly seen from Pasadena, show that
! the fires are far from being extinguished,
even on the front range, and great
1 volumes of smoke farther back indicate
; that a large area of timber land is still
! being devastated. Proprietor Switzer of
; Switzer's Camp, which, though the fire
I burned ail around it, is still intact, owing
I to the unusual precautions taxen, came
down this afternoon and returned with ten
additional men to go tip the south slope of
i Browns Mountain and meet the force
working this way from tbe north side.
The Sac Gabriel Canyon tire is stall
j burning fiercely and the Tejunga fire is
1 apparently spreading.
The City Council adopted a resolution
I to-day asking the County Supervisors to
: appropriate county funds'to help fight the
j fire. Some of the fire-fighters are disabled
! from injuries and others from poison oak,
and more are needed back of Pasadena,
i but particularly northeast of the San
! Gabriel Canyon region. It is reported
, that an area of fifty square miles has al- j
; ready been burned over. An appeal for j
. assistance was made to-day to the Los ;
| Angeles County Supervisors. It was re-
I ferred to the finance committee, with j
; power to act in conjunction with the j
j board.
DEPARTS FROM EULEYN.
The Monitor Slonattnoek Will Anchor at
j San > -Francis cÂ«.
EUREKA, Cal., i Oct. 6.â The United
States monitor Monadnock, which has
been in the bay here for the past nine
days, left for San Francisco this morning.
It was to have departed ' yesterday, but
owing to the lumpy condition of the â¢ bar
it was thought best to ' take ' no chances
with such a * valuable battleship.' The
depth of water on the bar nad nothing to
do with tne detention of the vessel, as
both in coming in and going oat the mon
itor had ; from six to eight feet ;of water
under her keel. , 1
. . The Monadnock is the first warship and
the largest vessel ; that ever crossed Hum
boidt bar,' and its presence here advertises
tne fact that this is one of the few safe and
accessible harbors on the coast. As a : re
sult cf the Monadnock's .visit it is prob
able that it or some other war vessel will
be tent I' each year ; to r drill s the naval re

First of a Trio of Socialists Arraigned i
for Speaking in Central
Park.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Oct. aâ Police ,
Judge Owens' courtroom wa3 packed to
the doors this forenoon by socialists and j
their sympathizers. The attraction was i
the trial of J. E. Higgins, ex-Conprega- ,
tional preacher, and one of the three so
cialists arrested a week ago in Central ,
Park while making speeches from a wagon, j
The forenoon session was devoted to se- j
lecting a jury, a most difficult task. At I
the afternoon session the first witness
called was Officer Eowie, who made the
arrest. He stated that residents on Hill
street came to him and requested him to j
stop the speaking, a3 it disturbed their
peace. Fe arrested the defendant, but
had no sooner started away with him
than another man mounted the platform
and commenced speakin?.
The defendant has subpenaed about
fifty witnesses, and the trial will doubtles3 |
consume two or three days. H. W. Wil- i
kins, former editor of the San Jose New I
Charter, was one of Higgins' associates
when he was arrested in the park.

SAN FRANCISCO'S LEARNED AND SKILLED SPECIALIST.
Years of successful practice in this city has stamped him as
; the master of medicine and surgery. Medical institutes have
| risen and fallen. Specialists have come and gone. Others will
come and go the same as those before them, leaving their patients
poorer and uncured, but Dr. Sweany, through the confidence of
| an appreciative people, throngh the great demands from the sick
! and afflicted for his professional services, and throngh his
\ unparalleled success in curing disease, has built up an immense
and extensive practice, which has substantially and permanently
established him in this city.
| In seeking the services of Dr. Sweany you place yourself under
| the care of a highly educated physician^ a* physician whose ambi-
j tion is to excel, whose whole life is devoted tothe advancement of
the science of medicine and the relief of suffering humanity.
He has no single remedy which he deals out as a common cure-
all, nor any mechanical contrivance which he heralds to the
j world as a remedy for all ills. His medical education condemns
: such methods. His lofty aspirations and honesty in practice
j place such modern impositions back in the days "of witchcraft
; and quackery, where they justly belong. Dr. Sweany is a great
: student as well as a Doctor. Through constant study and deep
I research he is always abreast of the times. There *is no new
| discovery in medicine, no new apparatus to assist the physician
in treating disease, but what is at his command as soon as
science proves it to be of worth and benefit. Every case that he
undertakes to cure is treated scientifically with such remedies
and such means as in his judgment that particular case requires
in order to effect a speedy and permanent cure. He has no
experiments to make in treating disease, for he is thoroughly
educated and prepared through experience already gained to
accomplish his work in the field of medicine. He has given
special attention to all classes and kinds of nervous and private
diseases of both men and women, and has restored to health
many after other methods of treatment and other doctors of
ability failed. Those living away from the city who wish to
avail themselves of Dr. Sweany's professional services should
always write an unreserved history of their cases, giving every
detail in plain language. He will then render them^such advice
as he deems will be of benefit to them. Call or addreÂ«> A

Whebkah. The Ban Francisco Call is the
only metropolitan daily havi::g a representa

J. M. Rosa,
F. J. Bettencouet,
M. T. Fbkitas
Something might be said of tue person
nel of the delegates who are in attendance
at this Grand Council. They comprise all
the walks of life â the doctors and lawyers,
judges and writers, artisans and mechan
ics, capitalists and laborers â all of Portu
guese descent, who have joined themselves
into a fraternal body for the protection of
the widow and orphan, the husband and
father. The Portuguese, although they
comprise a small proportion of the popu
lation of this State, are a thrifty, in
dustrious class of people, and it is the
ambition of each to own his own home
and prove a blessing in the community in
which he lives and an honor to the coun
try which he has adopted. Old Glory
waves proudly as their banner, and
many of the delegates who are present
hold positions of honor and trust under
the guidance of Uncle Sara.
The election of grand officers takes
place to-morrow and candidates have an
nounced themselves bj the score. Frank
Lemos will undoubtedly be elected grand
president, as Mattos and Fonte will with
draw in his favor. The most interesting
contest will be for medical examiner. Dr.
Cabrai of Oakland will contest the honor
with Dr. A. J. Dean of Haywards,
the incumbent. Dr. Dean is so well
known and popular*with all the delegates
that his defeat is doubtful.
The amendment to create a policy of
$1400 with an assessment of $2_a month
and also a policy of $700 at a cost of $1 per
month, was adopted. In case the wife of
the member dies, the husband would re
ceive $400 on first policy and $200 on latter.
The report of the grand medical examiner
was read and created much discussion as
to the suggestion he recommended. The
council then adjourned until to-morrow
at 10 a. m.
MUSICAL SUFFRAGISTS,
Brilliant Success of the Concert
Given by the Young
Ladies.
Few of the City's music-lovers were ab
sent from last nieht's campaign concert
given by the younger ladies connected
with the Woman Suffrage Bureau. The
Metropolitan Temple was crowded and
the large audience was well repaid for at
tending. The stage was beautifully
adorned with potted palms and flowers,
while the auditorium was festooned in
graceful hangings of harmonious hues.
The programme opened with Rossini's
overture from "William Tell," rendered
in masterly style on the great organ by
Professor A. 0- Eckmann. The j vocal
quartet from the Hawaiian band gave one
of its favorite numbers, and Miss Adeline
B eckhnsen played one of Chopin's waltzes
as a violin solo. .A- pretty number was
the guitar and mandolin duet by the
Misses : Grace and Lilian Homer. .while
Miss Mary Mann's rich, mellow. contralto
was heard to splendid advantage in the
song. "Spring's Awakening."
One of- the best numbers on the bill was
the serenade by the Knickerbocker Quar
tet. Mr. Laymance, besides singing in
the quartet, let some of his -silvery, high
note-* be heard in his solo, "Down by I the
Mere." Miss Jennie Eastman's aria from
I'RigoleUo" was well received," as was also
Miss Gertrude Judd's whistling solo,- "La
Czarina," while Miss May belle Holbrook's
mazurka on the violin : was â > a ; veritable
gem. : The concert ended with Mendels
sohn's "Idyl" by Professor Eckmann on
the organ.
The entire affair was most creditable to
the young j lail ieai under whose auspices it
was given, while financially speaking Miss
Holbrook's management was eminently
successful.* ' ,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1896.
CHARLES FAIR IS
ANXIOUS NOW
Does Not Know Whether or
Not His Sisters Are
With Him.
Attorney Delmas Has an Inter
esting Time With the
Opposition.
WHBELEK TRIES TO EXPLAIN
But Judge Slack Is Unab'e to Com
prehend His Reversible
Position.
Yesterday was the date fixed by the
court upon which the Fair will contest
to have come on regularly for trial.
It did not come on, but the occasion was
not lost to the attorneys for the Fair heirs.
They developed altogether the spiciest
row that has taken place through all the
length of the tangled litigation. It was
provoked by the attorneys for the Fair
sisters â Charles S. Wheeler and Reuben
Lloyd â and against them the army of at
torneys for all the other interests turned.
When the case was first called Mr.
Wheeler was the only one who answered
ready. As the daughters of the late Sena
tor Fair had previously withdrawn their
petition for the probate of the will and as
Knight & Heggerty and Arthur Rogers,
representing the contestants, had not an
swered at bII Mr. Delmas insisted that it
be made a part of the record that Dr. Marc
Levingston was ready for the trial.
Knight & Heggerty, representing
Charles L. Fair, moved a postponement of
the trial, stating that all the other attor
neys interested had agreed that the case
go over until, say, the 15th of November.
Here, Mr. Wheeler, representing Mrs.
Oelrichs and Miss Fair, put in the objec
tion that roused all the others. He said
they were ready for trial and wished to go
on at once to the final determination of
the status of Van R. Paterson (repre
senting Herman Oelrichs Jr.) in the con
test.
Mr. Delmns, of Delmas & Shortridge.
who represents the proponent of the will,
Dr. Marc Levingston, wanted to know by
what right Mr. Wheeler interfered, as he
was not a party in interest so far as the
record disclosed. "Since this controversy
began," he said, "I have offered no ob
jection to whomsoever would entering
the contest. But I insist upon knowing
who are my antagonists, who my allies.
"The daughters of Senator Fair having
first petitioned for the probate of this will
have since withdrawn their petition. It
is only fair that I should know whether or
not they are contestants. The record rep
resents them as defendants. I submit
that they should not be allowed a voice
in this matter until they have defined
their position. "
Wheeler recited the history of the pencil
will and his clients' relation to it. They
first presented it for probate together with
their brother. Afterward he withdrew
and opposed the probate. The sisters filed
an answer to the contest because they did
not have information concerning the gen
uineness of the will.
Subsequently coming to the belief that
it was a forgery, they withdrew the peti
tion, and with it the answer fell. They
appeared here as the parties in interest
and as a friend of the court to take excep
tion to the right of the contestants to con
test. They had their depositions, said
under oath, that they looked upon the
will as a forgery. At the proper time
they would file a contest. But they de
sired that the proceedings be regular and
depended upon the court to see that jus
tice was done.
"In other words," said Garret MeEner
ney, "they are partly in favor and partly
opposed to the pencil will. It is lime
that the counsel for the daughters of Sena
tor Fair should say where they stand;
they should be compelled, to use a handy
phrase, to either fish or cut bait."
Arthur Rogers, representing with Judse
Paterson, the minor heirs, and who has
not been heard in the matter before, made
a tart sally at Wiieeler. He declared that
before the case went to trial the daughters
should be required to define their posi
tion or remain out of the case. "As con
testants, we want to know whether they
are foror against this will."
Then up rose George Knight and joined
in the onset. "As representing the inter
ests of Charies Fair, 1 ' he said, "we are in
a peculiar position â made so by the other
counsel. We are trying to get out of it as
best we can. As a contestant, we look
upon Judge Paterson as a friend. We do
not entirely agree with his methods, but
we do not wish to hinder him. It is strange
to me that the counsel, if they are opposed
to the pencil will, should desire to cripple
the contestant, and why the heirs at law
should be misrepresented by the ir counsel
in this way. Charies Fair has a rifrht to
know w ether or not his sisters are with
him. He wants not only to learn it by
word of mouth, but he wants it on the
record."
Judge Slack said to Wheeler that he
could not understand his position, threat
ening a future contest of the will, but
denying tha right of others to contest.
Mr. Wheeler went over the ground
again. He was a friend of the court. He
represented parties in interest. He did
noi believe the minor heirs had a ri^ht to
make this contest and that matter should
be settled. That being done the parties
who had a right to contestâ his clients
would determ ne in what manner they
would make the contest.
"In other words," said McEnerney,
"Mr. Wheeler says to Van R. Paterson,
'We are with you in your opposition to
the pencil will, but we wish to knock you
out.' He says to Charles L. Fair, 'We'are
with you, but we wish to knock you oaf.
When you have been knocked out we will
come in as friend and protector of the
court and tile a contest.' But the others of
us fear that Mr. Wheeler will offer us
such protection as vultures give to lambs."
Mr. Delmas, who had been sitting quietly
at the counsel-table enjoying this war
among the counsel opposed to him, now
stepped in to bring the scene to a close.
He said that all the counsel who accord
ing to the record had a standing in the
case hod agreed to have the case post
poned until November 15. "Now." he
said, "a friend of the court, a mere citizen
at large, who comes to you, the court,
designating your weapons of justice as
being in your hand and the sources of jus
tice in your heart, calls upon you to dis
regard this agreement and the convenience
of the interested counsel, and to suit his
convenience go forward at once with this
trial. This is the only question before the
court. 1 ask, has he that rielit?"
"I must say I do not understand Mr.
Wheeler's position," said the court.
"Nor do' l," retorted Delmas, "but that
is immaterial. 1 do not even hope to un
derstand it. The only merit I can see in
it is that which Horace Platt felicitated
himself uion when, a solitary Democrat
at a Republican banquet, he said that the
Democratic contingent present was at
least harmonious."
Mr. Delmas, pleased with his little joke,
delighted at the disrupted attitude of his
opponents, sat down.
The court named as the date of the trial
the 9th of November instead of. the 15th,
and so the case went over.
Tiieu Reuben Lloyd uskod that Mrs.
Oelrichs and Miss Fair be released from
the subpena served upon them, and which
required them to oe present at the trial
and to furnish certain p;iper&. He said
they were then in court and could answer
that none of the papers referred to were in
their custody. It was very necessary that
they go to New York at once.
"Cannot this be arranged?" asked Judge
Slack of Mr. Delmas.
"Here are counsel, refusing to define
their position here, bnt who are attempt
ing to bring this case to trial when they
know that it would be next to impossible
for me to attend to it now. I ask your
Honor if under the circumstances I should
be expected to mni:e important conces
sions to them?" said Delmas.
"Well, they have given their deposi
tions, they are here in court and they are
going away to-morrow â I give the counsel
fair notice," said Lloyd, hotly.
â¢â¢Why the counsel should be so assidu
ous in giving me notice 1 cannot under
stand, said Delmas, coolly. "If his
clients have been advised to and are de
termined to break the law that is a matter
between them and the court. I have
nothing to do in the matter."
"Why cannot this be arranged?" asked
Judge Slack.
"I will tell your Honor why," said Del
mas. "I occupy a most peculiar position
here, a few months ago when I entered
this case 1 found all the heirs-at-law stead
fastly supporting tho will of the 24th. Ihe
children of James G. Fair had represented
in the most solemn and forcible manner
their belief that it was genuine.
"Now I stand alonedefending tbatdocu
tnent. I must carefully husband my re
sources in sustaining my cause. I want
the twelve men who sit in the jury-box
there to see the witnesses, to hear them
tell why they changed their minds and to
be assisted in forming an opinion by the
manner is which t:>e testimony is given.
A cold deposition does not convey this in
telligence. In the depositions already
taken many of the most important ques
tions the witnesses have refused to an
swer, the papers have not been produced.
This is a case involving the millions left
by Senator Fair. Surely his daughters in
such an important matter migntby trying
hard be able to remain here a few weeks.
I am sorry if it inconveniences them."
Wheeltr said it was a matter ot law ami
that tue subpena could not properly hold
them. He offered to produce the deposi
tions that the court might rule upon
them â whether the questions were mate
rial or not, or whether the witnesses
should be required to answer. Besides,
he said, they were residents of another
State, merely sojourning here, and could
not be held when the date of a lawsuit for
which thej r had been summoned was post
poned by the parties issuing the subpena.
The court seemed to agree with this
position.
"But I have not asked for a continu
ance," asserted Delmas. "I have said
from the beginning that I was ready to
try this case on twenty-four hours' notice.
I repeat that assertion. lam here ready
to ko on now."
This spifeed that gun. The others were
not ready to go on. However, the court,
in dismissing the matter, said that in the
general subpena requiring the attendance
of witnesses at the opening of the trial,
November 9, the names of Mrs. Oelrichs
and Miss Fair would be omitted. "You
know your course, 1 ' he said to Delmas.
"I do, your Honor," said Delmas, nod
dine, and officers stood ready, as they
came out of the court, to serve upon the
ladies new subpenas tUat had been already
issued at the instance of tne far-seeing
counsel to meet just this emergency. The
ladies will probably not leave to-day.
The date for completing the deposition
of Mrs. Craven before Judge Stack was
fixed for Saturday, the 17th. At the same
time the counter depositions of Lloyd,
Wilson, Dey and other* on behalf of Dr.
Levin ston will be taken by the further
order of the court.
The Silverltes.
Hjiaoorate preparations are completed
for the bis,' silver mass-meeting to be held
at Metropolitan Hull this evening. W. W.
Foote and James*H. Barry of the Weekly
Star will be the principal speakers. Gov
ernor Bndd has consented to preside. As
this will be the Governor's first appear
ance in politics since his campaign of
1894, it is expected that there will be a
great crowd present to hear him. There
has been much speculation as to his atti
tude on the financial issues and his
declarations will be eaÂ«ely looked for.
There will be the usual campaign songs
and music.

LYNCH ANX:OU3 OVER FORFEITS

i
Jim McGrath Challenges the Coast at
122 Pounds Weight, Raphael
Preferred.
The sporting world now is in keen an
ticipation of the contest between Green
and Tracy, billed to come off under the
ausDices of the new Occidental Club at
Woodward's Pavilion to-morrow evening.
The fight wiil be of ten rounds. Green
will probably weigh in at 142 pounds and
Tracy between 140 and 142.
Green's training consists of punching
the bag ana sparring in the morning at
the Olympic Club rooms, ana outdoor ex
ercise in the afternoon at the Olympic
Club grounds. He is being handled by
Billy Armstrong.
Tracy is being trained by Billy Delaney
in Oakland. He works at the Reliance
Club rooms in the morning and in the
afternoon lakes a run out to the Terrace
Baths. The betting on this event is about
even. Pools are not yet opened up at
porbett's, but are expected to start about
even.
There will be two other sparring exhibi
tions the same evening, one of ten rounds
between Billy WalKer of Australia and
Charlie Turner of Stockton, and the other
between two lignt weights for six rounds.
Tom Sharkey is expected here to-day.
If Corbett insists on "throwing" his fight
with Sharkey, Dan Lynch says the latter
will seek the nimble gentleman of the
pompadour and ''use rude language to
him." J. J. Groom of the National Club
has received a telegram from Corbett stat
ing that an important letter is on the way,
but as he mentions nothing about accept
ing the club's offer nothing definite can
be known until the letter arrives.
Lynch is slightly anxious over Corbett's
forfeit. He declares that Sharkey's money
has been up from the first, but fears that
the astute James haÂ« executed a hocus
pocus so far as his $5000 is concerned.
Jim McGrath is out with a challenge for
any 122-pound on the coast, Raphael pre
ferred. He is a brother of Tim McGrath,
who trained "Mysterious" Smith, for hia
late set-to with Gallagher.
SOCIALISTS AROUSED.
Oppoied to liepublioan France Toady
ing to the Czar of Kugsia.
The County Central Committee of the
Socialist Labor party met last evening and
elected Charles Riddel!. The latter, at
the request of the French branch, was
instructed to make arrangements for a
maas-meeting, the purpose of which is to
express condemnation of the action of the
officials of republican France in hobnob
bing with the autocratic ruler of despotic
Kussia. Resolutions deploring the death
of the late William Morris, socialist and
poet, of London, were passed.
The American branch of the Socialist
Labor party passed similar resolutions and
draped the branch's red flag.

FOR PRESIDENTâ
WILLIAM McKINLEY, or Obio
Â»OE TICF-PRESIDEXT-
GARBET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Fresno is all right.
The San Joaquin hag the life of trade.
It takes a competing road to do business
for the people.
Abovf all other local issues is the issue
of Republican harmony.
He is an enemy of Republicanism who
Eeeks to divide the party.
McKinley talks business every time and
business men listen to him.
The hoe that was roasted at the Fresno
feast was the S. P. monopoly.
One question of the campaign, What
does Bryan propose to do for workine
men? remains unanswered.
By and by San Francisco, like the San
Joaquin, will have a competing road, and
then we will have a banquet.
Is there no candidate in the Democratic
camp lor United States Senators ? Is Cator
all in all and without a rival?
Whatever is done against Colonel Tay
lor is done in tbe interest of Buckley and
Kainey, and don't you forget it.
There are not many workingmen who
wish to be paid in a fifty-cent dollar and
Bryanism is at a discount in labor circles.
Democrats may appeal their party
squabbles to the courts, but the Repub
lican party should be a self-governing
body.
Bryan may think he is stumping the
country, but we take notice that every
time anybody asks him a question he is
stumped.
No matter what figurehead may be put
on a factional Republican ticket It will be
the hands of the Democratic bosses that
push it along.
One faction of local Democracy has
gone off to the Populists, the other has
gone to the Non-Partisans, and the old
campground is deserted.
Perhaps the reason why we are hearine;
nothing about "the poor man's dinner
pail" in this campaign is because there is
no lonser anything in it.
As wheat is rising without waiting for
free silver coinage the farmers can see
they do not have to vote for Bryan in
order to promote prosperity.
Since Bryan has taken the stamp in
Tennessee we may put that State in the
doubtful column. Even bourbonism can
not stand Bryanism at short range.
Buckley has loaded nimself with Popu
lism and Rainey has loaded up with Non-
Partisanism, so now is the time to fire
them. Both loads are highly explosive.
Loyal Republicans will support the
local ticket indorsed by the State Central
Committee. To do anything else will
weaken tbe party and help the Democrats.
Tbe iehow that started the report that
Mr. Hanna concedes the electiun of Bryan
is certainly the wildest braying donkey in
. the Democratic camp. He merits the
medaL
According to Bradstreet the business of
the country was seven billion dollars lÂ»ss
in 1895 than in 1892. That is the differ
ence between Democratic and Republican
conditions.
Party government by State Central Com
mittee is universal throughout the United
States. Why should Republicans of San
Francisco make themselves an exception
to the rule?
Where iÂ« Bill English and where is Bill
Foote? Where are all the spell- binders
and sbouters? Why have they deserted
the whoop-her-up camp and gone off to
the camp of the doubters?
If San Francisco does not cast a Repub
lican majority that will carry the State for
McKinley it will be tbe fault of those dis
loyal members of the party who think
more of petty squaDDles than of great
principles.
Charles L. Taylor has been tried in office
and found able and faithful in fie per
formance of every duty. Why should any
Republican oppose his promotion to the
office of Mayor? Why should not all
good citizens vote for him?
Republicans represented by Colonel Tay
lor are giving a loyal support to Mr. Spear
for elector and Mr. O'Brien for Congress
in the 1 Fourth District. Why' should not
these men and their friends give an
equally cordial support to Colonel Taylor
And his ticket? ; \ . . 1
SAN FRANCISCO'S OPPORTUNITY.
Never have the people of San Francisco
had a better opportunity to provide a good [
municipal administration than in this j
campaign. The division of the Demo j
cratic party, the fusion of the Buckley
wing with the Populists and of the Rainey
wing with the Non- Partisans, opens a way
for the election of Colonel Taylor if only
the Republican party unites in his sup
port and receives the votes which it may
reasonably expect from the better element
of our citizens.
Colonel Taylor's official record is known
to every citizen who reads the newspapers
and has paid any attention to the con
duct of City affairs. On every issue aris
ing bsfore the Board of Supervisors in
volving the weliare of tbe people and the
interests of the City, he has acted uni
formly for the public good. Of this there
can be no dispute. The record was made
openly. It is to be found in the public
accounts of the proceedings of the Super
visors, and no man can point to a single
objectionable feature in it.
While Colonel Taylor in this way repre
sents the best interests of the City and the
highest hone>ty in official service, it is
known that those who are opposing him
are to a greater or less extent represetUa- j
tives of all that is meant by Buckleyistn â 
and Raineyism in municipal politics. To i
vote against Colonel Taylor is to cast a j
vote on the fide of those personal influ- j
ences which have been so corrupting in j
times past and which, it is hardly neces- j
sary to say, vriil be equally corrupting in !
the future. This being so, there ought to j
be a most cordial support given to Colonel !
Taylor by every Republican in the City I
an 1 by all members of other parties who j
are willing to unite with Republicans for
good government, clean politics and an j
honest, business-like administration of j
municipal affair .
Free silver coinage and a revenue tariff are
not the only mischiefs of the Democratic
platform. Perhaps they are not the chief (ft.
The repudiation of our obligations, the pros- j
titution of the courts to the will of a tun- \
porary majority, and the curtailment of the
power of the Executive are of the gravest im- j
port. â Hon. W. & Knox.

j
TO YOUNG VOTERS.
The address of McKinley to the young
men of Canton who are to cast their first
Presidential ballot at this election should
be read and studied by every young man
in the United States. It was warm with
the fervor of a true patriotism and laid
down principles for the guidance of young j
men not only in this campaign but for all
campaigns to come.
The Republican party, as McKinley
pointed out, represents the best hopes and
aspirations of the American people. It
embraces within rts doctrines and pur
poses the honor of the Nation and the
greatest prosperity of the public. No
party ever had a grander history or ever j
did more for liberty and equality. It has j
an especial claim upon the youth of the I
land, since it represents what is best 'in j
the past and gives promise of what will
be best in the future.
As in lÂ£6o the Republican party stood
for the maintenance of the Union so it
now stands for the maintenance of the
credit of the Nation and the promotion of
the welfare of the people. No party, as
McKinley said, appeals so much "to the |
intelligence, pride and patriotism of
young men." They can read in its his- j
tory the glorious records of Lincoln,
Grant, Garfield and Blame and gather |
; from the lives and words of these immor- j
tal leaders inspirations which will direct '
them in the paths of political wisdom and j
the truest patriotism.
Young Americans should vote for j
American principles and maintain Ameri- j
can industry against all the world. If i
they do this they will find their proper ;
place in the Republican party and have a
part in the great work of upbuilding the ,
Nation and making its glory more glori
ous still.
-~
Start the factories and put American ma
chinery in operation and there will not be an I
idle man in the country who is witling and !
able to work; there wilt not be an American â¢
home where hunger and want MfÃ not disap- J
pear at once, and there will not be a farmer \
who will not be cheered and benefited by his !
improved home markets and by the better and i
steadier prices for his products.â McKinley. j
FIGHTING FOR SENATORS.
A bulletin issued by the Republican
National managers declares that from now
on the Democratic National Committee
will in effect abandon tbe attempt to
elect Bryan and devote the rest of the
campaign to the election of Legislatures
in State- where United States Senators are
to be chosen. Their plan is to try to re
tain the free silver control in the Senate
by electing enough silver Senators to hold
the balance of power and prevent the
passage of a tariff bill.
One of tbe States in which it is tbe hope
j of the fusion to bring about the election
of a Senator opposed to protection is Cali-
I fomia. To achieve that result the fusion
managers have set aside tbe ablest and
wortniest leaders of the Democratic party,
and will combine with the Populists to
bring about the election of Mr. Cator. It
behooves the people of California to be on
their guard against this trick of the
enemies of the industries of the State.
California is already misrepresented by
one free-trader in the United States Sen
ate, and we cannot afford to run the risk
of another.
It is not likely that any more will be
required than to call the attention of the
peonle to this danger. The fight from now
on will be for Congressmen and members
of the Legislature. Bryan himself is
virtually defeated. His party is abso
iutely demoralized. Not one single man
of eminence is supporting him in the
campaign. The issue is to secure the con
trol of Congress. Fusion in this fight can
be defeated as eaÃily as fusion in the
Presidential fight. Let the people be on
their guard. No man should be elected to
Congr ss who is not in favor of protection,
and no man should be elected to the State
Legislature who will not yoU for a stanch,
stalwart Republican for the United States
Senate.
Industry must come first. Labor precedes
all else. It is the foundation of wealth; it w
the creator of all wealth. Its active employ
ment puts money in circulation and sends it
coursing through every artery of trade. The
mints don't distribute it in that way. Start
the jactories in full blast and the money will
flow from bank and vault. The lender will
seek the borrower, not as now, the borrower
the lender. â McKinley.
AS TO TOM WATSON.
Whatever else may be said of Tom Wat
son, it cannot be said that he is stupid.
When Watson announced that he was op
posed to fusion with the Democracy uÂ£on
any kind of a basis that contemplated the
transfer of Populist votes to the Demo
cratic candidates be showed, that he had a
good deal of political sense. He reasoned
along logical lines when he declared that
a Populist could not consistently vote for
a Seirail elector any more than he could.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1896.
vote for a Hobart elector. In fact, Wat
son's position with reference to the true
status of the Populist ticket before the
country has been right all the time.
Watson very properly holds that the St.
Louis convention was a legally consti
tuted Populist convention, and that no
provisions were made for the nomination
of any but Populists for President and
Vice-President. It follows, therefore,
Watson contends, that Bryan was nom
inated because the convention not only
believed him to be a Populist, but the
most available member of tbe Populist
party for Presidential candidate, as WTat
son was for Vice- Presidential candidate;
that no one has the right to undo the
work of the convention by substituting
another for either one of the nominees,
and that fusion or combination that con
templates making the National ticket read
"Bryan and Sewall, 1 ' "Bryan and Hobart"
or Bryan and any one other than Watson
would be an illegal proceeding. In that,
however, the Georgian is piayins bluff, for
electors are not bound except by their
honor to vote for any particular man for
President. McKiniey electors could vote
for Bryan if they wanted to, just as Bryan
electors could vote for Palmer or McKin
ley, or for some one whose name had
never been mentioned in connection with
the Presidency.
But Watson is clearly right when he
says the Populist party has no official
knowledge of such a ticket as "Bryan and
Sewaii," and therefore no Populist could
vote for such candidates. Watson adruit3
that the Bryan and Watson ticket could
com Dine witn the Bryan and Sewall ticket
and with the McKinley and Hobart ticket
for mutual advantage in local affairs, but
says no combination could be made by
which the standing and rights of a Presi
dential or Vice-Presidential candidste
would be jeopardized, for that would be an
nulling the work of the nominating con
vention, which could not be done except
by the party in convention.
While admitting the right of the Demo
cratic party to nominate Bryan and
Sewall electors, Watson insists that it is
an act of false pretenses to call such a
ticket the Populist ticket, and that it is
equally dishonorable to combine on
Bryan and divide on Sewall and Watson
in nominating electors. Of course \Vat-,
son could say nothing that would change
the programme, for the bosses have
already determined what their course
shall be, but he has the satisfaction of
showing the country that he is not the
chump the Bryamtes have been taking
him for.
It is said that silver is the poor man's
money. It is no more the poor man's money
than it is the rich man's money. It is the
money of small transactions, and, the tran
sactions of the poorer c ass of people being
generally smaU, it is the money a/most ex
clusive y used by them, and therefore I want
it to be as good as the dollar that is used by
the rich man. â William D. Bynum.
ABSUED ON THE PACE OF IT.
The report that Mr. Hanna despairs of
the election of McKinley was effectually
refuted by the vote in Connecticut on tne
day it was made public. How can any
man who is at all well informed be doubt
ful of Republican success in a year when
every election shows Republican gains?
There was an increase of the Republican
i vote even in Arkansas last month, and
j now the town elections in Connecticut
I prove that the great Republican majorities
j of two years ago are to be exceeded in that
: State in November.
Mr. Hanna when asked about the re
! port said: "It is absurd on the face of it.
| I have never at any time anything
; capable of such construction. I have
j never conceded the election of Mr. Bryan
j and I certainly cannot concede it now
when tbe tide is flowing so strongly and
; unmistakably in the direction of Repub
! Hcan success." It hardly needed this de
nial to confirm the public judgment on
the report which was flashed up so con
spicuously by the Examiner yesterday.
I As Mr. Hanna says, absurdity was "on the
i face of it," and in no possible form could
| that absurdity have been made more
: prominent and protuberant t an in the
i particular shape the Examiner gave it.
The report in itself was a matter of but
little importance. It derives interest only
; from the fact that it is another evidence
I of the foolish, ridiculous and almost silly
i way in which the campaign is beinÂ» cun
| ducted by the Popocrat managers and
organs. No story is too evidently false
for the managers to set afloat or for the
organs to publish with display headlines.
The leaders of the Democratic party who
! have scorned the Bryan platform setm to
have taken all the brains of the party
with them. The managers or misman
agers in charge of the fusion are making a
I campaign which is nothing more than a
I political farce. The whole programme is
i "absurd on the face of it."

THE SCHEME
EXPOSED.
What Is Said of Mr. Hearst's
Position on the Financial
Question.
Contemporaries Unite in Denoun
cing the Silver - Mine
Owners' Conspiracy.
The editors of California continue to
speak out plainly regarding Mr. Hearst's
attitude on the financial question. A few
extracts are appended:
STIRRED UP A HORNETS' NEST.
Woodland Mall.
The Examiner siined up a hornets' nest
when it attacked The Call and the manner
in which the latter is getting back at the
Fakamlner is highly amusing.
THE REASON.
San Bernardino Sun.
Thk Call has lound a reason for the open
championship of free silver by the Examiner
and the Journal. It lies in the fact that some
thing like $8,000,000 of the Hearst estate con
sists in silver-mine; properties. It's a good
reason, too, but tna public likes to know, you
know.
ONE RATHER WEIGHTY REASON.
Napa Register.
The Call says the.Examiner has substantial
reasons for advocating free coinage; that the
"unlimited" system of finance would mean
for Mr. Hearst $400,000 a year ; that the out
put of the Ontario silver mine, in which Mr.
H. is largely interest-'d, would alone leap
Irom $10,000 to $ 75 ,000 a month.
FOR REVENUE ONLY.
Redding Free Press.
The Ban Francisco Call has been drawing
the deadly parnllel.on the Examiner, much to
the tatter's discomfiture. Thk Call charges
that the present utterances of the Examiner
on the silver question are in direct antagonism
to its published ideas one year ago, when it
denounced free silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.
The Hearst estate is interested in eight &ilver
mines, and has "substantial" reasons for ad
vocating tree sliver at this time. Tne proprie
tor of the Examiner appears to be in the silver
combine for revenue only, which explains the
silver editorials and artic.es now published in
that paper. Free saiver would undoubtedly
be a good thingâ for the Examiner.
GRAND WORK.
Amador Republican.
Mainly through the efforts of the San Fran
cisco Call the people of this Coast have had
their eyes opened to the real enormity of the
monumental and colossal silver mine owners'
conspiracy to g2t oontrol of this Government.
It is so enormous that it almost staggers be
lief, but the truth seems to be well established
by The Call, ana all that the people can do is
to shudder and th nk God that it Is no worse,
and that it has been exposed intimetopre
veut this nation from falling into a trap. The
work the Call has done in unearthing and
exposing this gigantic combination is simply
grand, and should be and will be appreciated
at its true value by the people of the whole
country, and especially of the West, saving
and excepting alwuys those interested in the
scheme aad their friends.

in town property, and also in some valuable
timber claims. She has always been public
spirited, and on several occasions has partici
pated in campaign work.
She says that Eureka, including the country
generally about Humboidt Bay, lsquiet. There
is almost no outside demand, comparatively
speaking, for lumber, so many of the mills are
not running. Of those that are, some are with
small forces of men.

several days. She will remain at Vallejo

TWO GERMAN CONCERTS
Active Preparations for Inter
esting Events in the
Pavilion.
The Proceeds Will Bs Devoted lo
Charitable Workâ The General
Committee.
The German General Benevolent Society
and the German Ladies' General Benevo
lent Society are preparing for two grand
promenade and garden concerts to be held
in the Mechanics' Pavilion on Saturday
and Sunday evenings, October 17 and 18.
The net receipts of the two concerts will
go to the two organizations to be used for
charitable purposes. -
: The ladies' society has been , organized
since 1870, and it now has a membership
of 225. The amount of good work it has
performed in relieving distress is not
known to the general public. 1 The gentle
men's organization was formed over forty
years ago and since that time it has spent
over $2,250,000 for the German Hospital
arid ; charitable work. It has a member
ship of about 3300. .
The affair now being arranged is under
the direction of Gustav Uinrichs.
The festival will not be of the nature of
a fair, but will be arranged r.s an unpre
tentious, enjoyable reunion of all German-
American associations, and of all the
friends of those societies with a view to
fostering and encouraging their laudable <
efforts under the banner of benevolence
ana humanity. The annual charity ball
of the German Ladies' Society will not
take place this year; the ladies count,
however, upon the success of these enter
tainments to meet the demands upon ;
charity. j

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLES
THE GENERAL FCSTOFFICE.
a Correspondent's Efforts to Locate That
Institution.
To the Editor of the San Francisco CallâSn:
At the present time the public are in a quan
dary as to the esact location of the San Fran
cisco main Postoffice.. borne three weeks ago
all the carriers and the majority of the clerks
were ostensibly transierred irom the old main
Fostoffice, at the corner of Washington and
Battery streets, to the newly erected red log
cabin situated at the foot of Market street,
now known as "Station D" Pos'.cffice. After
making several "fool's errand" trips on Sun
days to the old office the regular Sunday
callers were finally impressed with the iact
that hereauer they would be obliged to call at
"Station D" for their mail on Sundays and
holidays, as all business pertaining to the City
Distribution, as well as to the outside dis
patches, would be transacted only at that
office, and that only the money-order, stamp,
general delivery and registry divisions would
do business at the olu aland.
Callers whose mail was formerly delivered
from the old main office, after calling ut "Sta
tion D" on Sunday aDd Monday last (Labor
day), were informed that their mail wouid be
deiiveretf to them at the old office again, as it
was found necessary to move the carriers
back on the day before. It is very annoying
to the public to be kept running around iv
this manner after their letters, first to one
office and then to another, without any appar
ent certainty as to where they thould really
Advance announcements should be made by
the Posioffice officials before any nsw move is
made for the guidance 01 the public, and this
mysterious shilling of the carrier division
from one place to another is not at all in keep
ing wiih the working ot that branch of the
(ioverument service.
Another matter whlcn I would like to
draw your attention to is the fact tiiat on
Sundays, holidays and weekdays, after 5
o'clock in the afternoon. U is impossible to
purchase stamps or postal-cards in the vicin
ity of the main office. Yesterday, i^abor day,
I stepped into a stationery-store necr the old
Postoffice and a*keu to be accommodated
with a small quantity of postage-stamps, but
the clerk poately informed me that within a
couple of uours in the forenoon he had sold
nearly $20 worth of stamps ana did not have
one left. He said thai since the carriers' de
partment of the old main office had moved
no stamps could be purchased outside of the
regular weekday stamp-office hours. The pub
lic support the Postoffice Department, and why
should not the pubiic be served in a proper
manner, Pro Bono PublicÂ©.

WAS PICKED UP
IN A DENSE FOG
The Ship Kelburn Was
Making Port Under
Full Sail.
A Chapter of Accidents During
the Long and Boisterous
Round Voyage.
VESSELS WRECKED AT ALTATA.
Two San Francisco Vessels and a
German Barkentine Among
the Number.
The British ship Kelburn came in
through the fog yesterday. Tugs were
out in plenty, but not one of them saw
the bitr vessel until the Alert ran across
her by accident. The Kelburn hove up
in a moment and the tug had to go full
speed astern in order to avoid a collision.
Once hailed, Captain Jones of the Brit
isher did not hesitate about taking a tow,
and soon after noon his vessel was at
anchor in the bay.
The Kelburn had an unusually disas
trous voyage. While lying in Newcastle,
Australia, Captain Jones broke his lep;
and was laid up for several months. On
August 8 last the vessel was caught in an
unusually heavy gaie and tlia cross seas
caused the ship to roll and pitch in a ter
rific manner. John Anderson and John
Harvey were on the mizzentopsail yard
reefing when an unusually heavy lurch
threw Harvey against Johnson. They
both lost their hold, and while Johnson
went overboard Harvey fell to the deck.
The former was never seen again and
Harvey only survived his injuries twelve
hours. Anderson was a native of Sweden,
aged 46 years, ana Harvey was a native of
the United States, aged 31 year 3.
The Kelburn is coal-laiien, and after
discharging will take in a cargo of wheat
for Europe.
A private letter received by Captain
Olsen, owner of the schooner Rebecca,
gives the information that another dis
aster has occurred in the Gulf of Cali
fornia. The details are meager, but it
appears th*t the town of Altata has been
wiped out and the schooners Rebecca and
Comet a of this port and the German
barkentine Heiena are total losses. On
the' last occasion it was a tidal wave that
did all the damage, but this time it was a
hurricane.which swept down on the town
ship and left only one house standing.
The letter says that the damage was done
prior to September 18, but as it was writ
ten in a hurry. In order to reach San
Francisco as quickly as possible, no de
tails were given.
The Rebecca and Cometa were well
known in this port, the latter being one of
the smartest vessels of her class afloat.
She was built by Turner at Benicia, and
was especially designed for service in
Central America.
The British ship Blairgowrie, Captain
Mansen, got in from Newcastle, N. S. W.,
yesterday in fifty- three days, the fastest
trip made this season. The last time the
vessel was here Captain Dark was in com
mand, but when he retired Captain Man
sen took command. It is thirteen years
since the present master of the Blair
gowrie was in San Francisco.
The America got in from Prince Wil
liams Sound yesterday with 53,000 cases of
salmon. While in Alaska the mate fell
from aloft and broke seven of his ribs. He
has not yet fully recovered from his in
juries. The America's cargo is the largest
consignment of salmon that has come to
San Francisco this season.
The Coryphene had a narrow escape in
the fog yesterday. . The wind fell light
and the vessel nearly drifted ou Point
Reyes before Captain Grant could get
steerage way on her. Later a tug hove in
sight, but the captain deciined a tow and
elected to sail in. When the Santa Clara
returns from her trip to Australia Captain
Grant will take command of her and some
one else will take the Coryphene.
The revenue cutters Perry and Richard
Rush, the former from Astoria and the 1
latter from Sitka, got in yesterday. The
Corwin got in some days ago, and with the
arrival of the Bear the entire fleet will be
here for the winter. The Rush brings the
news that the schooner Sitka, seized for
illegal sealing, has been condemned and
ordered sold. The case will probably De
appealed to the United Stales treasury.
Captain Dan Haskell, the well-known
and popular master of the big tug Fea
less, was yesterday given the appointment
as pilot, and will proDably take office the
first of next month, or as soon as the tug
boat company can spare him. As a tow
boat master Captain Haskell has been one
ot the most successful in San Francisco.
Hia long search after the Honresfeld will
be Jong remembered, while the number of
disabled vessels he has towed into port
are legion. For years he has been one of
the Spreckels' tugboat company's most
trusted employes, and also oue of the most
popular men on the water front. All and
sundry join in wishing Captain Haskell
success in his new undertaking. Captain
Trask, who retired from the office, could
not have a more worthy successor.
The Harbor Commissioners did not hold
a meeting yesterday. President Colnon
was back Irom Eureka, but as Commis
sioner Cole was in the country, and Com
missioner Chadoourne in the East, there
was no quorum. , Probably a session of
the board will be held to-morrow.
The French bark Jules Verne arrived
last ni ht from Newcastle, N. S. W., 114
days out. She had an unusually long
passage, owing to strong head winds, high
seas and calms.
SCHRADER GONE.
The Alleged Healer Has Left Town for
Kansas.
"They have wept," was the curt reply
given last evening when inquiry was made
as to the whereabouts of Schrader, the
alleged healer, and the speaker then
added: "The healer, his agent and the
photographs are on their way to Kansas,
having purchased first-class ; tickets for
the whole outfit."
The self-styled healer, who did not heal,
after consulting with his scent upon the
articles published in The Call about him,
concluded that the atmosphere of Cali
fornia, and particularly Ban Francisco,
despite the many assertions about beauti
ful climate, was not of the kind he desired
to breathe, so, without giving notice of
his intention to leave, he purchased tickets
for the city named, and without; saying
good-by to any one he left the City with
all his belongings.
Injured by the Cars.
Joseph J. Oumper of 1217 Kearny street,
received painful injuries lust Monday night
while crossing Broadway and Kearny streets.
He stopped at the curve between two car
tracks as two cars going in opposite directions
passed him. The tracks are so close together
that the steps of the two cars almost touched
each other. Mr. Gumper lost some flesh from
his shins by being struck by the car steps, and
he saved himself from being thrown down aud
mangled by jumping on one 01 the cars.

A Scheme That Failed

Disorder Over Parliamentary
Law and a Grand
Marshal.
PREPARING FOR A PARADE.
The National League of Republican
Clubs Will Wave Torches and
Transparencies.
A chairman who lacked the mental
agility and knowledge of parliamentary
procedure and a meeting the members of
which were at cross purposes and exceed
ingly verbose, were the causes of a stormy
session of the National League of Repub
lican Clubs last night.
The meeting had been called for the
purpose of making arrangements for a
grand torchlight parade, and the rock
upon which it grounded was the election
of grand marshal. It was alleged on the
side that the guileful Colonel Kowalsky
had packed the meeting m the interest of
G. E. Morse, the husband of a niece of
Major McKinley, and that the job was to
elect him grand marshal at once. The
other side said that General Sheehan him
self wanted to be grand marshal.
General John. F. Sheehan headed the
opposition and insisted thai the election
should be postponed until the next regu
lar meeting for the reason that not one
third of all the clubs in the City were
represented by delegates present.
The proceedings were enlivened with
several ornate speeches by Senator T. C.
Maber, who smoothed the ruffled feathers
of the meeting while he was on his feet,
but as soon as he ceased the air was hazy
with motions to adjourn, calls for the pre
vious question and points of order. Most
of the discussion was carried on by four or
five delegates on their feet at the same
time yelling at the chair.
Finally, after a considerable storm, a
motion to refer the matter to the execu
tive committee with instructions to report
at the next meeting was put and decided
by a standing vote of 42 for and 28 against,
but Chairman Morse refused to announce
the result. General Sheehan thereupon
left the hail and was followed by cries of
"Bolter." This made him red in the neck
and he hurled back defiance.
Vice-Chairman Thomas W. Collins cut
the Gordian knot by putting the question
to adjourn and declaring it carried.
The following clubs were represented:
Twenty-ninth District Club, W. P. Duran.
Army and Navy League, James Kipp.
Union League, J. b". Sheehan.

Z. J. Dodge read the report of the com
mittee appointed to make the preliminary
arrangements for a monster torchlight
parade. The committee reported that they
considered that the interests of the party
would be weil subserved by holding a
monster torchlight parade in this City.
Chairman McLaughlin of the State Cen
tral Committee haÂ»t given the committee
the assurance that the State Central Com
mittee most heartily indorsed the parade.
Colonel Stone of the Union League had
also approved of the proposition. It was
estimated that the cost of the parade
would range between $3500 and $5000. Tbe
committee recommended the appointment
of William Cluff as treasurer and the ap
pointment of an executive committee of
fifteen with full power to act.
The report was amended by making,
instead of a committee of fifteen, a com
mittee composed of one representative
lrom each of the clubs represented at the
meeting.
Ohio Is Solid.
Colonel James A. Whiteside, president
of the Veteran Soldiers' and Sailors' Asso
ciation of California, has received two let
ters, one from H. L. Morey, ex-member of
Congress from the Third District of Ohio,
and one from State Senator. Harris of
Ohio.
The following is an extract from Mr.
Morey 's letter: â  â¢ ' /; ':â ;,<â ;â 
In : a conversation yesterday with General
Boynton of Washington, I). C, he said that the
result in Maine is but an .index of what will
happen in all the States east of the Ohio. He
spoke with the utmost confidence and enthu
siasm. !
I do not remember a campaign since the war
period in which the people ' were so intensely
interested as in the present one. If the ten
dency la in our direction, as I believe it to be,
this intense interest, may carry the result to
surprising lengths, and it is lor this reason
that I feel the. .confidence I have herein ex
pressed. .â .;.,.â ;-; ?' ; ;.~ .- Â..,â¢. 'â¢,..;â  Ââ .â -â '.-..:
The letter from Senator Harris states
that Ohio will give McKinley a plurality

BOURBONS ASLEEP
AT THE SWITCH
Democratic Blundering Will
Lose Them Stanislaus
County.
They Creep to the County Clerk's
Office Too Late to File
Their Ticket
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT.
Attorney John E. Richards Will Rep
resent the Republicans at
tbe Bar To-Day.
It Is very probable that the Democratic
leaders in Stanislaus County have wrecsed
their prospects hopelessly by falling asleep
at the switch and failing to file their ticket
within the time provided by law.
The whole question will corns before the
Supreme Court this morning in the hear
ing ou a writ of mandate asked by the
Democratic Central Committee of Stanis
laus County.
Chairman Elliott of the Republican
County Central Committee of Stanislaus
County was in the City yesterday, and he
retained Attorney John E. Richards to
appear before the Supreme Court to-day
on behalf of the Republican party. There
is no dispute about the facts, which are
as follows:
On Monday the Democratic Central
Committee presented its certificate for fil
ing at the Clerk's office, Modesto. The
Clerk refused to accept it on the ground
that Monday was a legal holiday. Yes
terday the certificate was again offered
and was refused because it was too late,
not being presented within the time pro
vided by law, which says the instrument
must be lileii not mbre than sixty nor
less than thirty days before election.
Mr. Richards will contend that, irre
spective of the question of legal holiday,
the Democrats arrived too late, the legal
time having expired on Saturday. That
is the construction that has prevailed in
this City ana elsewhere throughout the
State.
If the Republican committee win it
will be equivalent to a gain of sayeral
thousand votes for the Republican party,
as there will practically be no other ticket
in the field.
Death of Arthur DintfeUpiel.
Arthur Dinkelspiel, secretary and one of the
owners in the Kutner-GoldSteln Company of

years in the store at HÂ»uford, and then went
to Fresco, spending in all about ten years out
side of the City. Then he came here with the
firm. He had for some time been in feeble
health. Four months ago he went to Wash
ington, but was not benefited by the change
and returned. His age was 38. He was the
brother of Emiie and Louis Dinkelspiel, and
of Mrs. J. R. Davidson of this City and Mrs.

DUCK HUNTERS'
MASS-MEETING
The Sportsmen's Protective
Association Expects
Trouble.
Preserve Clubs Have No Right
to Blockade Navigable
Waters.
IBIS GUN CLUB TRESPASS CASE
Attorney James Smith Instructs the
Members on Matters of Impor
tance to Sportsm n
The Knights of the Red Branch Hall
was crowded last evening with the mem
bers and friends of the .Sportsmen's Pro
tective Association. W. J. Anern, the
president, occupied trie chair, and after
calling the attention of the sportsmen to
.the objects of the meeting he introduced
Major James Smith, the attorney for the
association, who addressed the members
at length on the subject of land preserves
and the blockading of navigable waters.
In answer to a question in relation to
the obstruction of navigable sloughs, Mr.
Smith said that the lessees or owners of
land had no jurisdiction over any slough
or water course that has ever b?en used
for navigation, and as an illustration be
mentioned the Frank Horn slough in the
Suisun marshes, which has been blockaded
by the lessees of the property which sur
rounds it on either aide.
"If the slough in question is of sufficient
depth to float a small schooner," said Mr.
Smith, "it is certainly navigable accord
ing to the Interpretation of the laws of
navigation, and no one has a right to
place obstructions in it that would im
pede navigation of any description. The
Attorney-General, I have no, reason to
doubt, will take the proper steps to
remedy the nuisance when he has con
cluded that the laws of navigation have
been violated.
"Of course this matter must be properly
investigated and the facts submitted to
him before he will be in a position to pro
ceed in a lawful way."
Mr. Smith said further that the law rela
tive to salt marsh land giving sportsmen
a privilege of shooting on all overflowed
lands was certainly unconstitutional, but
that additions could be made to the law as
it now reads which v. ould be of material
interest to the association.
'Jtie case of the Ibis Gun Club against
certain members of the Mallard Club and
many otiier so-called poachers will come up
lor trial next Monday in the Circuit Court
before Judge McKenna. Following this
trial tbe Teuk berry case, of which so
much has been said and written, will come
up before the Superior Judge of Contra
Costa County. This case will be tried in
Martinez.
A special meeting of all sportsmen in
terested in duck-shooting preserves will
be held some evening of next week.
The secretary of the association was in
structed by the chair, at the suggestion of
George Dennis of Alaraeda, to write to the
Governor of the State that its members
heartily approve of John H. Sammi for
the offic of State Fish Commissioner in
lieu of William C. Murdoch, who recently
resigned. â

The idea in to gwe an entertainment
that will be thoroughly unique, and that
will afford such a variety and quality as
will be interesting from beginning to end.
Tbe programme will probably be about
half theatrical and half club.
There is a great deal of talent in the
club and there is a desire to utilize some
of it. At the same time there will be at
tbe date of the entertainment a number
of stars in the City, comprising ladies and
gentlemen who have attained exceptional
distinction on the boards. A number of
these have already tendered their services.
There will be original papers of unusual
merit, poems, music, bits of tragedy and
comedy, caricature and brief addresses.
The object is to give an exceptionally
good programme without continuing it to
i undue length. Popular prices will be
charged.

William N. Neilson's Wife
Insists Upon a
Divorce.
Says He Threatened Her With
His Control of the News-
Letter.
CRUELTY IS THE GROUNDS.
A Complaint Bristling With Charges
Involving the Conduct of the
Well-Known Attorney.
Through her attorney, P. B. Nagle, Mrs.
Nancy Neiison has brought suit for di
vorce from her husband, William N. Neil
son, on the ground of extreme cruelty.
Tne petitioner was a Miss McFarland
before she wedded the defendant, in 1894.
He is one of the characters that go to
make the history of the State. He was,
if he is not to-day, a brilliant writer. His
line was that of deep study and serious
ness, and twenty years ago when Fred
ericfc Marriott pere took him up he was a
power.
It was he who first discovered that Miss
Hillâ Sarah Altheaâ as she was subse
quently called, had a grievance against
the late Senator Sharon. He induced her
to bring suit for divorce from the multi
millionaire, and during the first stages of
the case he was her adviser and friend.
Subsequently they quarreled, the young
woman making ail sorts of accusations
against him of selling her out and deliv
ering to Sharon documents which could es
tablish her right to call herself nis wife.
These charges were not substantiated.
Out of this suit grew others innumer
able in which Neiison and his employers
were always the defendants, suits that
were the outcome of his tierce attacks
through the papers in which i,e wrote
against the people on the other side.
The^e suits, continued indefinitely in the
lower criminal courts, have never come to
a consummation, having been dropped
from the calendar.
The cruelties to which the petitioner,
according to the complaint, was being
subjected were of an unspeakable nature
physically. She says that he refused her
food, so "as to indulge his appetite for
strong drink and laudanum; drove her
from a sick bed to make her wait upon
him, and while she could hardly place one
foot before another compelled her to climb
a steep, two-mile grade, packing an im
mense bundle. In the latter case he
tramped on ahead and gained a place of
rest, where be lay down to enjoy his com
forts, and made her wait upon him as a
sJave. These were the physical injuries
inflicted. As regards to the moral ones
they take in a wider scope. Curses and
words degrading for any woman's ears to
hear were heaped upon her.
The defendant, it appears from the com
plaint, also made threats that were most
disquieting. When the plaintiff could no
longer support him he caused her to bor
row money from her relatives to do so.
When she could no longer borrow and ne
would not help in the maintenance of
their home he followed her to the home of
her sister. They lived there until, says
the complaint, "his drunken and lauda
num-befogged condition incited him to be
vulgar and beastly in bis way of eating
and rough and uncouth in his language"
to his benefactors.
Then, the wife says, he, being threat
ened with expulsion, declared in return
that he was in control of the News-Letter,
a weekly publication in this City, and
that if the plaintiff or her sister refused to
care for him he would eat at tne free
lunch counters of the saloons in this City,
"a fit place for any gentleman to eat," and
that he would wreck his wife and her
friends with the articles he would write
against them.
He would do more than that, according
to one of the allegations in the complaint,
which reads:
He proposed to court favor by the use of the
News-Letter by vilifying Protestant ministers
and teachers for the purpose of getting Into
the good grace of Father YorKe and the
Roman Catholic Church, so that they would
take care of him the remainder of his days;
that they were always glad to make converts
of superior nwn like him and that were it not
for the incumbrance of this plaintiff he coula
be a priest.
The petition was filed before Superior
Court Judce Slack, who assigned the case
to Judge Daingerfield.
The latter immediately issued an order
restraining the defendant from commit
ting the threatening actions complained
of and compelling him to show cause on
the 16th iust. why an order should not be
made condemning him to pay plaintiff $60
per month alimony and $250 attorney's
fees.
Fred Marriott, proprietor of the News
Letter and the employer of the defendant,
was also included in the restraining order
against any transfer of debts or credit of
the defendant .
TOOTED HIS OWN HORN
Hon. D. S. Farnsworth Offended
the Ashbury Heights Im
provement Club.
Report on the Disused Rails of Oak
and St anyan Streetsâ Demand
for Later Cars.
The Panhandle and Ashbury Heights
Improvement Club held a special meeting
â¢Oast night at the Columbia Cyclery Hall.
1970 Page street, to hear the reports of the
various special committees appointed at
the last meeting.
The committee on Market-street Rail
road Company, composed of Messrs.
Hendrickson, Lund and McFarland re
ported that they had waited on Manager
Vining in regard to haying the unused
rails removed from Oak and Stanyan
streets. They asked for further time,
stating that a day had been appointed to
meet Vining again next week, when &
definite answer would probably be ob
tained.
A resolution was adopted thanking
Thomas Ashworth, Superintendent of
Streets, and his chief deputy, Andrew
Donovan, for the speedy starting of street
work or. Oak and Stanyan streets and
iheir hearty co-operation with the club for
improving the Panhandle and Ashbury
Heights districts.
It seems that the president of the club.
Dr. Salfield, had invited E. 8. Wolfe,
candidate for Senator from the Twenty
first Senatorial District, to come before
the club and make an address on the
political questions now under discussion.
This caused an active debate, and led to a
vigorous protest irom Henry Coffey, who
did not want the club to pu: itself on
record for any party or candidates. A
motion embodying this non-partisan idea
was carried. .
H. I. Mulcreevy warmly commended
the action of the club. He was followed
by D. S. Farnsworth, Kelly- Mahoney
candidate lor Superintendent of Streets,
who delivered a lengthy harangue, promis
ing that if, the club would support him
they would not be disappointed in secur
ing his earnest support as an official.
Farnsworth was not all bashful. He ex
plained that he considered himself the
best man for the position, and for that
matter believed that the majority of the
people thought so as well.
Mr. Farnsworrh's action was the more
deprecated by the club as he was per
mitted to speak out of courtesy immedi
ately af:er the adoption of the resolution
condemning political speeches in the
club. Such was" the general indignation
at his conduct that a member of the club
rose as soo.i as Farnsworth had finished
"tooting" and said he hoped no member
would again mate a speech to the club
asking for political support
E. J. Wolfe, candidate for State Senator
from the Twenty-first, briefly responded
to an invitation to speak, and said it was
the co-operation of all good men that de
stroyed "boss" rule. He was generously
applauded.
James P. Haggerty, Louis Lipman and
Charles Ellis were appointed a committee
of three to confer with the directors of
the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric
Railroad in regard to running their cars
through to Stanyan street after 9 p. m.
Considerable complaint had been made
by various members at not being able to
reach their homes by this route later than
9 o'clock.
JUSTICE DELAYED.
Judge Campbell's Court Adjourned
Through the-Xon- Appearance of the
Prosecuting;. Attorney.
The case of James Neal and Joseph
Burke, charged with grand larceny, was
set for preliminary hearing before Judge
Campbell yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock.
The two men were brought from the
City Prison and their attorney and the
witnesses for the prosecution and defense
were all in court when the Judge took his
seat on the bench. Prosecuting Attorney
Charles H. Forbes was not present, and
after waiting patiently for nearly an hour
the Judge nad to adjourn court owing to
Forbes' non-appearance, and all the par
ties interested in the case will be put to
the trouble of appearing again on Satur
day.
This is not the only instance. During
the preliminary examination of John Col
lins, longshoreman, a few days aso on the
charge of murder Judge Campbell had to
perform the duties of Judge and prose
cuting attorney, as Forbes was not pres
ent ,

Keenan having in the meantime been ex
cused. Four men were therefore needed,
and F. W. Zehfuss, M. Spiro, William H.

His Honor read the usual charge to the
jurymen, instructing them a> to their
powers and duties, and after the appoint
ment of Frederick Hobbs as foreman, the
jury retired to its room and selected Harry
Durbrow as secretary. It was then discov
ered that some one had answered to the
name oi Â£. H. Cutter at rolicall in the
courtroom, for Mr. Cutter was absent.
The jury returned and reported the mat
ter to Judge Slack, who ordered the mem
bers to report this afternoon at 1:45, when
Mr. Cutter will be sworn in and the
charge re-read.
Frederick Hobbs has long been a resident
of San Francisco and is a member of the

MAY BE A SUICIDE.
C. B. Aii-tin's Family Afraid His Body
Will Be Found in the
Bay.
The disappearance of C. B. Austin, 65
years of age, was reported to the police
yesterday afternoon by his daughter, Mrs.
Martinez of 1600 Lexington avenue.
He has been a sufferer for years from
violent headaches and frequently, while
under their spell he threatened to commit
suicide. Monday he suffered from an un
usually severe attack and acted very
strangely.
He lived with his son at 1911 Mission
street and about 11:30 Monday night his
daughter-in-law saw him leave the house.
She watched him from the window and
became alarmed when she saw him board
a Mission-street car going in the direction
of the ferry.
She hastily donned her hat and cloak
and followed him to the ferry. She made
inquiries about him, but no one had seen
him. It is thought that he had been able
to catch the 11:45 boat and his friends are
afraid that he had jumped overboard
without being seen.
What leads to this suspicion- is that he
left his watch, knife and other articles
that he always carried with him in his
"room. He was also an inveterate cigar
ette smoker and did not even take any
cigarettes with him.
He is five feet five inches tall, full gray
beard, white hair and wore a gray sack
coat, overalls and black soft hat.
ATTORNEYS WRANGLE.
Lawyers in the Quill -Case Quarrel
Over the Impeachment of a Wit- - ;
ness.
The proceedings in the : Quill damage
suit against the Southern Pacific Com
pany were yesterday enlivened by an
other tilt between counsel. The railroad
attorneys sought to impeach Witness
Cheeseman, who testified for the plaintiff.
Cheeseman swore that he is an insur
ance agent, while the lawyers of " the cor
poration offered to prove that his occupa
tion is that of selling lottery tickets.
They were not allowed to proceed because
sufficient ground for the impeachment
had not been laid in direct' examination.
The witness will probably be recalled.
Seven witnesses were on the stand yes
terday, the burden of the testimony being
as to the time the train stopped at the
station at which May j. Quill met her
death. The ; plauitiff claims -it was r sta
tionary but five seconds, while, the de
fense seeks to prove a much longer period.

BEGUILED WITH
. BIG PROMISES
Insolvency of the Equitable
Aid Union of Pennsyl
vania.
Affairs of Class A Placed in
the Hands of a Re
ceiver.
MANY THOUSANDS WERE DUPED
Liabilities Shown to Be Three Hun
dred Thousand Dollars in Ex
cess of Resources.
Another endowment organization,
which promised to its memberÃ more
liberal returns than it was justified in do
ing according to the assessment imposed,
has cadsed wailing and gnashing of teeth
among its constituents, who number more
than 30,000, including about 1000 memDers
in California who support about half a
dozen lodges or unions.
On September 19, 1Â§96, a receiver was
appointed at Erie, Pa., by Judge Guani
son to take charge of the affairs of class A
of the Equitable Aid Union on a showing
made by one of the beneficiaries under the
laws of the order that its liabilities were
$300,000 in excess of its resources.
Some time during 1895 the wife of Al
bert E. Bowell of Corry, Pa., died. She
left an endowment policy in the union
calling for $650, payable to her husband.
Repeated demands failed to secure a
liquidation of the claim and Bowell finally
resorted to the courts, asking that the af
fairs of the union, so far as class A is con
cerned, be wound up. His showing taken
from official figures, which were not ques
tioned or contradicted by the officers of
the Equitable Aid Union, set forth that
the New York jurisdiction of the order
had liabilities to the amount of $163,283 50
in excess of all resources, actual and ex
pected; that the Pennsylvania jurisdiction
had a similar excess of liabilities to the
amount of $100,547 91; that the Supreme
jurisdiction, in which is included Cali
lornia, was $34,462 25 behind, and the Ohio
jurisdiction wu shott $3201 15 of being
able to meet the claims against it. The
only solvent jurisdiction was that of
Michigan, which had resources to the
amount of $6*6 80 in excess of liabilities.
On this representation the Judge men
tioned appointed Chauncey P. Rogers Jr.
of Corry, Pa., receiver.
Despite the fact ti>at thia occurred on
September 19, the officers and members of
the local unions assert that no official
notice of this matter has yet been re
ceived in this City, and many of the mem
bers are still paying their assessments,
which are being forwarded to the head
quarters of the order, located at Colum
ous, Pa.
What makes the situation more aggre
vating to the local members is the fact
that on August 1, 1895, the supreme body
created what is virtually a new organiza
tion, and which was distinguished from
the old one by being called class B, and
which was provided as a sort of safety
valve for class A, but of which the local
members were not informed until about
three or four months a;Â»o.
The managers at Columbus claim that
class A was wrecked because of the "ex
pectancy endowment" feature. This pro
vided for the payment of half the face of
the policy when the policy-holder reached
a certain age. In class B this "expect
ancy" clause is eliminated, and all mem
bers of class A were privileged to join class
B on the payment of a certain amount,
fixed according to the face of the policy,
as an initiation fee and the continued
pavraent of the former assessment.
The time for joining class B expired on
the Ist of August, 1896, and but very few
members in this City, not a score in all,
took advantage of the opportunity to
leave the wrecked order. They claim that
they were not informed of the unsound
ness of class A, but on the contrary were
assured by some of the local lodge officers
that its affairs were in good condition,
and that class B was simply provided for
such as ilid not care to stand any possible
future increased assessments.
Membership was made attractive isj this
order to people fairly well advanced in
years, both men and women being eli
gible, and the membership was largely
composed in consequence of people who
could not afford to Duy insurance at the
regular market rates, and who therefore
feel their loÂ«s the more.
The Odd Fellows' Library.
The special committee having charge of the
advancement of the Odd Fellows' Library,
after discussing various ways and means to
promote its interest, has decided to send a
notice to each non-contributing memljer of
the order, asking his co-operation in the
matter.

THAT TIRED FEELING
Ennui Reigns Supreme at
Their State Committee
Rooms.
This Is Explained by the Fact
That the Feople Are Not
for Bryan.
M'KINLEY TO WIN CALIFOKNIA
Such Is the Conclusion That Must Be
Reached After Analyzing the
Situation.
Rent by â chisms, feuds and dissensions,
the Democratic party of California to-day
YOUNG MR. ALFORD, the Boy Manager of the Boy Orator's
Campaign in California, "Waiting for Something to Turn Up.
presents a spectacle that would be pa
thetic were it not grotesque. Tbe leaders
of the party, the wheeihorses of the or
ganization, the men who in the past have
been reiied on for support, the brains and
worth of the party have voluntarily re
tired from the heat of battle, because they
see that Bryanism cannot win in this
State this year. The places of these old
; time warriorsâ the grizzled veterans of a
thousand fields â are occupied, but not
filled, by striplings of no experience or
executive ability, to whom are joined a
few venerable political hacks who are
willing to scrape up any crumbs, however
trifling, that may happen to fall to them
from the party lunch-counter.
The situation at the Democratic State
headquarters in the California Hotel on
Bush street in this City may be taken as a
fair index of the actual state of affairs
throughout California. Visit the head
quarters and yon will see for yourself the
evidences of depression and hopelessness.
A plain, unvarnished description of the
place will carry conviction to every candid
mind that the adherents of Bryan have
practically abandoned all expectations of
carrying California on the 3d of next
month.
Nothing will convey a better idea of the
outlook than to compare the present con
dition of the rooms to their appearance
during the campaign of two years ago,
when Frank Gould of Stockton was in
command and the master spirits of the
old party were on deck day and night
booming the cause to which they were all
devoted, i'ou can see nothing of that
kind now. â  The rooms are practically de
serted. There is no life.no stir, no en
thusiasm. In the secretary's room are
several tables, but only one solitary clerk
sits there hour alter hour writing his
name over and over again with a blue
pencil on an immense sheet of blotting
paper, only varying the monotony of this
exciting performance by cutting unused
telegraph blanks into small fragments
with a brand new pair of scissors. There
is one typewriting machine in the room,
but its keys do not click to tue music of
stirring messages to the erstwhile faithful
throughout the length and breadth of the
land; for tbe reason that the aforeiaid
erstwhile faithful have lost interest in
such communications. The inventory of
office furniture includes one telephone
silent) and two messenger-call boxes (not
in use).
Then there is a picture of Mr. Bryan.
In fact there are two pictures. But the
one that attracts most attention is a col
ored lithograph from a , St. Louis pub
lisher representing the Democratic nomi
nee as a rosy-cheeked young man of bucolic
appearance, with a smile like a seraph and
neckscarf like that worn by the tamborine
endman in a minstrel company.
"It's a pity to put up a flashy picture
like that," admitted tbe lonesome clerk,
pausing for a moment in his work of sign
ing his name, "but it seemed to please
tome of the boys, bo we let it go at that."
In the next room sils the Hon. W. H.
Alford, the boy manager of the boy ora
tor's campaign in California. He list
lessly rests bis patent leather shoes on his
patent roller desk and patiently waits for
the important political visitors who never
come. To relieve the ennui he chats with
the janitors and messengers that now and
again happen in with unimportant infor
mation about inconsequential matters.
But you should see the visitors if you
wish to size up the situation as it actually
exists, .for they really do have some visi
tors at the Democratic State Central Com
mittee rooms. _
The most prominent caller on Mr. Al
ford yesterday was a gentleman who pro
claimed himself as a polyglot politician,
and offered his services to speak in five
different languages in as many successive
minutes at any public meeting that might
be called by the committee. :
This was thought to be a pretty good
proposition and was taken under advise
ment by the manager of the orator's cam
paign.
I After that came a painter who was wili
ng to limn Mr. Bryan's pleasing counten
'rfnce on the dead walls of the City and the
Seal Rocks at the Cliff House < for $3 per
limn. tt- r
Then came a procession of bill posters,
distrtDutors of campaign documents,
. would be stump speakers, grafters,
hangers-on ana the like, but to all of them
the boy manager oi the boy oratw'a cam-
paign turned a deaf ear. He was waiting
for Digger game.
"Why do you suppose they employed a
boy to run the Democratic machine this
year?" growled a wrinkled politician who
has seen better days, "l'li just tell you
why they did," he continued, answering
his own question. "They had to take this
smooth-faced Jad because they coukin t
get any of the old warhorses to stand in
and shoulder the responsibility of certain
defeat. Youn< Mr. Alford will live long
j enough to outgrow it, I hope, for I have
nothing against him. He is bright and
polite and well educated and well dressed,
and he wears a sweet, pink in his button
hole; but what he hasn't learned about
managing a political campaign would
make Bill English and John P. Irish and
Frank Gould or Jim Budd laugh.
"What do you suppose was the reason
Mr. Alford gave lor not wanting to send
me out to North Beach to make speeches
forJ3ryauand free silver?" he demanded
I austerely. "I'll tell you that, too. He
1 said it was because the committee had no
I free silver to give out for expenses. Qi
course, they have no free silver or any
thing else to run the campaign on, and
good reason, too. It's because the people
of California are not with 'em in this cam
paign, and people consequently don t
come up with the money. It's no dis
grace for a committee to be poor, of
j course, any more than it is for a man to
I be poor, but when you understand the rea
! son for the Democratic State Committee s
depleted exchequer it is a dead pointer on
how the cat's going to jump, for if the
people of the State believed in Bryan and
haa any Idea that he was gorng to win
they would contribute funds enough to
hire speakers to stump North Beach dis
trict and the PoÂ»rero. That shows me that
McKinley has got the State, and that we
Bryan men might as well get ready to
throw up the sponge."
AMBROSE AND HIS CINCH
Rainey's Man Has a Father
Who Wants the Pound
cf Flesh.
Plenty of Spoils "On the Side" if
Democracy Controls the S'reet
Department.
There has lately been a great deal of
speculation among the large class that is
engaged in laboring in the Street Depart
ment as to what would be the outcome of
the election of William Ambrose as Super
intendent of Streets, owing to the fact
that his father now shaves the warrants of
employes of the Street Department.
It has lately been argued that the elec
tion of Ambrose could mean, inferentially,
that none save those who sell warrants to
his father would be welcome on the pay
roll. The Call has lately heard consider
able complaint about tnis phase of the
question and the matter is quite plainly
voiced in the following sample letter, be
ing the complaint of one citizen:
San Fbancisco, Cal., Oct. 3. 1896.
Editor Call: Is there no protection for the
poor workingman? At 5334 City llall avenue,
opposite the Hall of Records, there is a saloon
kept by M. Ryan. On the 2d and 3d of each
month Mr. Ambrose, the father of Sam
Ralney's nominee for Superintendent of
Streets, Billy Ambrose, hires one oi Mr. Ryan's
back rooms to shave tne warrants oi the em
ployes of the Street Department from 3 to 5
percent. If Mr. Ambrose can shave the wai
rants of the Street Department now, what will
he do if his son Billy is elected Superintendent
of Streets? He will have an office the same as
George Ackerson had when Billy was Superin
tendent of Streets, and no man will be em
ployed that does not '-ash his warrants at his
piace of business. "Uncle Smith," on Mont
gomery street, gets some now, but he will oe
out in the cold if Biliy Ambrose is Superin
tendent of Streets. EJdie Greaney says that
Ambrose was his man for that office from the
start. It was be that mentioned Billy's name,
and he is going to have a say who his deputies
are going to be and who the men aie that will
work on the streets. If Billy Ambrose is
elected it will be another Billy Ackerson Sup
erintendent of Streets. One term and he will
be dead. Yours truly, Joseph McCakthy.
A Call reporter visited Ryan's saloon
last night and found the place almost de
serted. "Ambrose has his office here one
or two days each month," said the pro
prietor, "but I don't think he makes
much money out of it. He shaves war
rants for the accommodation of a few of
his friends, but he has not been here for
some months, because I thinÃ he has run
short of coin."
There are many people, however, who
believe that the election of Ambrose would
force workingmen to patronizs his father
or compel them to resign.
PLANS ACCEPTED.
BidÃ for the New Municipal Kuiltling
Will Be Opened on tne
26th lust.
The Municipal Buildings Committee of
the Board of Supervisors took a decisive
step in the matter of the structure which
is io be built ou the siie of the old City
Hall yesterday.
The committee was called together to
pass finally on the plans of Architect Shea
that were accepted some time ago.
The plans were elaborate and accom
panied by many type-written paces of ex
planation, all of which was satisfactory
to the committee.
It was unanimously decided to accept
the plans and to advertise lor sealed pro
posals to be opened on the 26th inst.
The matter of putting a clock in the
tower was discussed, all of the members
being in favor of a timepiece. It was de
cided to tmrchase a clock, the price of
which shall not exceed $2500. The ques
tion of putting in bells or chimes was not
decided.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1896.
IN THE SUPREME
COURT'S HANDS
The Case of D. L Farns
worth Against Regis
trar Hinton.
Garret McEneroey Opposes the
Granting of a Writ of
Mandamus.
A. RUEF FOR PETITIONER.
The Legislative Act Defining What
Is a Legal Convention Exten
sively Debated.
The Supreme Court, in bank, yesterday,
took under advisement the case of D. L.
Farnsworth against Registrar Hinton, in
which a petition is presented for a writ of
mandate to compel the defendant to place
the Kelly-Mahoney nominees on the bal
lot of the regular Republican party.
The petitioner's counsel were A. Ruef,
A. Barnard, W. T. Baggett, A. W. Mor
genstern and C. H. Forbes.
The defendant was represented by Gar
ret McEnerney, J. Alva Watt, Thomas D.
Pviordan and John M. Chretien.
Originally, this matter was brought up
by J. B. Brown, the Senatorial candidate
put up by Mahoney and his associates,
and the attitude of the court in this case
will decide both at one sitting as well as
any future move on the same lines.
The lengthy petition of plaintiff filed
several days ago was answered by Garret
McEnerney, counsel for the Board of Elec
tion Commissioners, in behalf of Registrar
Hinton.
Attorney J. Alva Watt, in a few concise
expressions, placed before the court the
denials of the defense to the allegations
made by the plaintiff. He spoke princi
pally of the undisputed right conceded to
the "County Committee since 1892 until
1894 and to the present organization to call
tor the conventions through which were
made the legislative nominees.
The contention of the plaintiff that the
Kelly-Mahoney faction had held a joint
convention of the Fourth and Fifth Con
gressional districts was untenable, and if
only the Fourth Congressional District
was represenied it represented but a frac
tional portion of the City and County of
Sun Francisco, and the entire fabric must
fail to the ground.
Ruef argued that the joint convention
was simply one of the Fourth Congres
sional District and of all the Assembly
districts encompassed by the boundaries
oi the Jity and County of San Francisco.
He added that the particular point he
desired to put forth was the denial of the
right of a Registrar, who is but a minis
terial officer, to refuse to receive and file a
properly certified list of nominations.
"If the petitions are properly formed
the Registrar shonld accept and file them.
In a case such as this the province of ac
ceptance or rejection should lie in the
hands of tbe party, at the polls, and both
tickets should be presented to them for
their suffrage.
"I deny the power of the County Com
mittee to give a set of nominees to the
party at large to vote upon.
"A political party can only be one which
at the last election polled a 3 per cent vote.
The primary held by the faction Here rep
resented polled 10,000 votes. Is it then to
be contended that at tbe regular election
the County Committee with in handful
of men is the Republican party, or is the
organization to he represented by these
10,000 voters?"
Attorney Ruef stated further that if it
was accepted that the County Committee
represented the Republican party the
former could at any time throw over the
latter for the benefit of some other party
regardless of the objection of the greater
number of Republican voters.
"The only thing that gives the County
Committee power/ added Ruef, "is the
acquiesence of the Republican electors;
there is nothing in tbe law recogniziug
the supremacy of the State or County
Committees.
"I contend that any Republicans of
this City may organize among themselves
and repudiate the County Committee."
"You are then rather antagonistic to the
stand yon take in the Fourth Congres
sional District Convention, are you not?"
asked the Chief Justice.
"No," answered Ruef. "We explain our
right as a body of Republicans to repre
sent the party as well as hag the County
Committee.
"We do not deny their right to filing
their tickets, but we claim an equal right,
which is refused us by the Registrar.
"I understand that the other side trusts
to the decision rendered by this court
some years ago in the Dolan case. 1 take
it that the decision was given because the
plaintiff's side bad assumed to appropri
ate the name of a party already in exist
ence."
"How would the voter know whether he
is voting for party principles if you put so
many ticnets in the field?"
"The Republican principles would be
voted anyhow, because all nominees
would be of that party, no matter the in
dividual.
"The election law is unconstitutional,
according to my idea. There is no way to
regulate the 3 per cent inquired at "one
election to entitle a party to a piace on
tbe ticket at the next. In this case of the
Democratic-Populist fusion, for instance,
bow will it be possible to tell at the next
elections after "this which percentage each
party received? Hence, if each cannot
hold a convention, the politics of the
country must remain as a monopoly In
the hands of the old parties."
Garret McEaerney said: "In regard to
the question in these proceedings of
whether or not the Registrar, as a judicial
or ministerial officer, has done or failed to
do his duty according to law, it appears
from tbe act passed by the Legislature
that only one list of nominees is entitled
to recognition or else there would be no
necessity for regularly organized conven
tions according to law, and a properly cer
tified ticket of nominees ou file.
"Tbe petitioners in tbii case do not say
they are the Republican party, but they
state they claim to be. They do not deny
our right to represent the Republican
party, Out they hope to share with us in
the feast. It is just like the infringer who
offers to grant to the rightful owner of a
patent a share of his rightful belongings.
"If the petitioners deem they are wrong
fully dealt by tney should find redress
within the party or cease to be partisans.
"The court has no jurisdiction by writ
of mandate to compel tbe Secretary of
State to do an act which it is not his duty
to do, and there is no way to remedy the
matter.
"If this court cannot Â«cc its way clear to
decide which of the 1 two claimants to the
title is entitled to it, it must leave the pe
titioners where they were picked up. The
petitioners do not deny the rieht of the
regularly organized body of Republicans,
according to custom and authority, to file
its certificate, but they step in when pro
ceedings are brought calculated to disin
tegrate the party."

Snpsrvisor Berjamin Will Move to
Purchase a Year's Supply of
the Drugs
At last oriental science seems to have
called a halt to the ravages of that dread
Eastern scourge, leprosy. About two
months ago Supervisor Benjamin, who
had personally interested himself in the
lepers at the Pesthouse, raised $200 by
subscription and sent to Japan for the
celebrated remedy of Dr. Goto. This
eminent physician had used it in the hos
pitals of Yokohama with marked success,
if not positively curing the patients at
least checking the disease and bringing
comparative ease and comfort to the af
fected persons.
When the case of medicine arrived Mr.
Benjamin, being unabie to get it landed
duty-free, paid the customs charges and
sent it out to the Pesthouse. There were
sixteen iepets in thut hospital, some of
them Chinese, including a woman of that
nationality, some of them so badly af
fected that they could hardly move
around. They immediately began to use
the remedy in the shape of pills and in a
bath.
The result is most satisfactory. The
dreadful pain and the tormenting itch of
the great swollen spots have in most cases
completely ceased, and the ravages of the
plaeu* have been cheeked. Ah Loung, an
intelligent and English-educated China
man, who is onltf slightly touched with
leprosy, is tno most favorable case. His
face, neck aim Hands are clear of the pus
tules and rosy tint that mark the leper,
and several of bis countrymen show un
mistakable evidences of improvement.
Anna, the Chinese woman who play^the
organette for visitors and by their gen
erous contributions is enabled to buy
many little comforts for herself and fel
low-afflicted, seems to have taken on a
new lease of life. She has purchased a
new cylinder â the air of "Marching
Through Georgia" â for her music ma
chine. When she is lying in her Goto
bath she passes away the time turning the
crank of the wheezy little instrument, and
the inmates of the dismal institution hear
"From Atlanta to the Sea" all day long.
Lena Grinn, the girl donated with her
afflicted brother to this City byMendocino
County several months ago, shows less im-
Erovement than the others. Her face is
adly swollen and one of her hands al
most useless.
There are now sixteen lepers at the hos
pital, a new patient having come in last
Sunday. His name is George Pepalou,
and he is a white man, born in the Hawa
iian islands thirty-six years ago. There
has been leprosy in his family for three
generations. He was living in Houston,

Texas, with his brother, who died from
the disease not lons ago, and the health
authorities of that city passed him along
toward the Pacific Coast. His ticket, with
which they provided him, gave out at El
Paso and he was given another by the peo
ple of that place. It carried him to Los
Angeles, where the lynx-eyed Board of
Health caught him and it was a toss-up
between their pesthouse and San Fran
cisco. This City won, as usual, and an
other ticket was given him, which brought
him here.
Pepalou does not use the Goto remedy,
but a preparation which he first procured
at Hot Springs, Colo. The prescription is:
Strychnine, 1-150 of a grain; chlorate of
potassium, \% drachms; oil of aconite,
10 drops; distilled water, 1 quart; dose,
from 2 to 3 tablespoonsful three times a
day. He says this treatment is curing
him rapidly, and that his body, once cov
ered with the pustnL., of true leprosy, is
now clear of all evidences of the plague.
The patient is desirous of returning to
Honolulu that he may join his brother
and si >ter at the leper colony on the island
of Moiokai.
Mr. Benjamin is so far encouraged by
tbe efficacy of the Japanese remedy that
at the next meeting of the Board of Super
visors he will bring up the subject and try
to have a year's supply, of the Goto drugs
'mirchased in Yokohama for the use of the
lepers here. He believes that $500 will be
ample for that purpose. There is enough
of the remedy remaining at the Pesthouse
to last two months.
URGES THE CHARTER
In Resiguing Cummitteeman M. H.
Hecht Advocates an Unselfish Con
sideratioD of the Instrument.
The following communication is self
explanatory:
San Francisco, Cbl., Oct. 6, 1896.
J. Richard Freud Esq., Secretary Citizens'
Charter Associationâ Dear Sir: Nothing short
of the utmost importauce could induce me at
this time to obey the imperative summons that
called me by wire to-day to Boston and compels
me to resign' from the finance committee,
though I should still like to remain as vice
president of the association if I may be per
mitted to do so.
If it is at all possible I shall return In time to
participate in the closing days of the campaign
for the charter. In my judgment the import
ance of its adoption overshadows by far every
issue before the people of San Francisco. If it
should be defeated it will bo a calamity for
our people from which they will suffer for a
very long time, certainly until a charter can
be adopted. To my mind, while this one may
not be absolutely perfect, there can never be
a charter framed again that contains more
that is good and less that is bud. I have care
fully observed all that has been advanced
against it and can easily trace every objection
to self-interest, pure and simple, with perhaps
the objection of too much power in the Mayor,
which is only apparent, but not real and has
been explained away many times.
If the new cbarter is defeated It will be
from precisely the same causes that have re.
tarded our progress and blocked the prosper,
ity that our btate is by its wealth and re
sources destined to enjoy. It i 3 sad, but un
fortunate that our people do not seem able to
rise above their own petty little individual in
terests so that no public question is ever pre
sented but what the majority of our people
ask. themselves first and foremost "how will
this affect me?" Until this condition is
changed it is hopeless to expect good govern
ment and honesty in public affairs, and the
sooner this is understood the better for us all.
This may seem harsh criticism, but is, alas,
too true. lam now speaking from the expe
rience that came to me in the advocacy of the
new charter, though, it is by no means a new
idea. I could furnish many instances cor
roborative of, this statement, which, however,
is so apparent, from everything; bo far said
against the charter that a simple analysis will
reveal its truth. In conclusion, I appeal to
you all to spare no effort to secure tne adop
tion of the charter; try to make the people
understand that they owe something to the
community in which they live, that the great
est good to the greatest number is a truism that
has never yet tailed to bring forth golden fruit.
'â¢The Lord'heips him who helps himself," and
if our people are so indifferent or so selfish as
to defeat this organic law that has so much to
commend it, and is absolutely necessary for
our future good government and home rule,
then let us forever alter hold our peace, cease
bewailing our misgovernment, betrayal oi
trust in office, incompatency of our officials,
and lay the blame exactly where it belongs,
to ourselves. Sincerely, M. H. Hecht.

Boardman.
The Rector of St. Stephen's Comes
Over to St. Luke's to
Officiate.
THE BRIDE IS A BELLE.
Four Bridesmaids in Ye low Taffita
Gowns and Black Velvet Gains
borough Hats.
Miss Mary Mercado and George C.
Boardman were married yesterday at noon
at St. Luke's Church.
Rev. E. J. Lion, the rector of St
Stephen's, and for many years a warm per
sonal friend of the bride,, left his own
pulpit to come to the little church on Van
Ness avenue to pronounce the young
couple man and wife.
It was a yellow wedding. Yellow roses
and chrysanthemums were placed upon
the altar, and cordons of yellow blossoms
twined the chancel rail.
Promptly at the hour announced foT the
ceremony the strains of the "Bridal
March" from "Lohengrin" announced the
arrival of the bridal party.
From the restry-room came the bride's
attendants, the maid of honor, Miss Mar
garet Salisbury, and Miss Kate Salisbury,
Miss Mamie Scott, Miss Clementine Kip
and Miss Julia Tompkins. The young
ladies marched down the center aisle to
the entrance, where they met the bride.
The procession was again formed, and
with the ushers, S. H. Boardman, Charles
M. Gunn, Milton Latham and Samuel
Buckbee, leading, the party proceeded to
the altar.
Here the groom, assisted by his best
man, T. Danforth .boardman, awaited the
arrival of his bride.
Rev. Mr. Lion read the impressive
Episcopal service, and in clear, firm tones
th c young couple made the responses.
After the ceremony a wedding breakfast
was served at the residence of the bride's
cousin, Mrs. Sanchez, 2140 Sutter street,
at which only the relatives were present.
The bride wore an elegant gown oi silver
velour. The jupe was en traine and per
fectly plain and the corsage was elabo
rately trimmed with rare old point.
The maid of honor wore a modish gown
of white taffeta and chiffon and a large
white felt picture hat, trimmed with long
white plumes.
The bridesmaids were attired alike in
yellow taffeta gowns and wore black velvet
picture bats and black gloves. All the
attendants carried bouquets of long
stemmed white chrysanthemums.
The bride, who is a charming and ac
complished young woman, is a niece of
Mrs. Monroe Salisbury and a favorite in
the smart set. The groom is connected
with the firm of Shainwald & Buckbee.
Mr. and Mrs. Boardman left last even
ing for a three weeks' bridal trip, to be
spent in the northern part of the State.

YOU FEEL SMALL.
HOW SMALL YOU FEEL WHEN
you begin to notice your powers of
manhood waning. Then you lose the con-
fidence and self-esteem which comes with
vigorous strength. You imagine yourself
small, and you are. You lose that respect
which is the right of manly qualities.
You get nervous, fretful and incapable of
mental action. You are approaching ner-
vous debility, and Deed help.
Through years of good, faithful service
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt has been the

made thousands of lives happy, saying
them from a miserable existence. "1 am

It is a natural remedy. It cures by
making you strong and helping you to
throw off disease. "It only belps nature.' '

rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure: iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hleh" means hlch barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is - usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and raini.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington
coasi. Whin the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure tailing to the California coas'- warmer
weather may be expected In summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NtW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 6 âSpeculation at the '
Stock Exchange to-day was unusually quiet, the
sa'es of stocks aggregating only 113.160 shares.
The dealings in the bond department were also
light, footing up.a .title over $. 00,000. The share
list at the opening wis inclined to sag on weaker
quotations from London and the reports from that
center showed a rather disturbed condition of
affairs, because of politics. As a result prices have
yielded about Vi to 1 tier cent. Following the re
action there was a sharp rise in Sugar, Manhattan,
Tobacco and leather preferred, . but the usually
active stocks continued to sa<. he stocks named

Manhattan a rumor which was subsequently

gained 2 pÂ«r cent to 67% on contracts put out on
dividends In the afternoon suddenly advanced
10 12 per cent, and there started moderate liqui
dations all along t:ie Hue. The rise in money was
due to the disturbances in loans incident 10 the
city tax payments. This caused great shifting of
call runs and accounts for the bull department.
Later the quotations dropped back to 3 to 4 per
cent. In the late decline in stocks, sugar. Chicago
gas, the grangers. Louisville and Nashville, Read
inc and Manhattan were conspicuous.
The decline in the highest point of the day was
equal to .fa.li /S percent, Manhattan leading. A
favorable development of the day was the con
tinued weakness iv the s erltng exchances, the
result of an increased Â«upply of commercial ac
ceptances and a light demand. Rumors of fur

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, bit, Oct. 6.â Wheat Drices were
rushed up lc between yesterday's close and this
morning's opening so that holders found them
selves considerably better off when trading bej;an
to lay than when it endi'd yesterday. The strength
originated abroad, Liverpool quoting a Strong
market, at an advance of \ 3 (pi Id. Commission
houses had European buying orders and were well
patronized. Receipts in the Northwest were
heavy at 1. '289 cars, against 1,182 last Tuesday
ami 1,01)6 a year ago Chicago received 364 cars
and Inspected out 409,820 bushels. Trices con
tinued to advance throughout the morning.
Bradslreet's report of an increase in the world's
visible supply of 3.721,000 bushels temporarily
cased the market, but it was soon lost slsht of,
prices rallying to the early high point. Export
clearances were liberal at 4. '4.11. bushels. Clos
ing Antwerp cables were l'-'Vs imes lower
and Berlin IVi marks higher. Realizing sales
caused recessions at the cose. December wheat
opened from 68% to 68% c, advanced to 69"}ic,
closed at l>9c, Vie higher iban yesterday. Lsti
mated receipts to-morrow. '2so rars.
CORNâ This grain received sufficient firmness
from wheat to cause a fair advance iv price.' The
influence mentioned was (be principal one, and
under the encouragement offered thereby shorts
wen- Induced to act on the Ion;; side. Liverpool
cables were i^d higher. Receipts were 41- cars.
Bra i s:r. el's imported an increase in stocks of
873.000 bushe.s- May corn opened from 26% to
â -6 4. sold between 26% to 1:6%. closed at the
inside y a higher than yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts 10-morrow, 670 cars.
OATSâ Followed the lead of wheat and corn,
oats s owing improvement early. There was some

GRANTED MORE TIME
The Auditor Given Another Week iv
Which to Complete the Assess
ment Kolls.
OAKLAND. Cal., Oct. 6.â The County
Tax Collector had to refuse some tax
money offered h m to-day, owing to the
failure of the Auditor to have the assess
ment rolls made up. To-day was the first
day taxes were payable, but the only rolls
accessible were six from Alameda, five
from Berkeley Township, one from Hay
wards, one from P<easanton and one from
Livermore.
The following letter received from C. M.
Coglan, clerK of the State Board of Equal
ization, to M. A. Whiiiden was read at the
meeting of the Board of Supervisors and
ordered placed upon th minutes:
Dear Sir- In nccordnnce with the provision
of section 30705, Political Code, 1 certify to
you the following order, this day made by the
State Board of Equalization, and entered upon
its minutes:
"It is hereby ordered that the time of the
Auditor oi the county of Alameda to deliver
the assessment-bc.k to the Tax Collector as
required by section 3732 be and the same is
extended one week, to the second Monday in
October."
T c board also listened to W. W.
Cameron of Pleasanton, who wanted them
to build a steel bridjre seventy feet in
length to take the place of the present
wooden bridges 800 feet in length, and
the annual replanking of the same. The
citizens have subscribed nearly enough to
build a canal from the Rose estate to
Lopez place. Tne matter was referred to
the District Attorney to report upon the
power of the board.
Arnott Did Not Betorn.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 6 âThe contin
ued absence of Motorman Robert Arnott
of the Twelfth-street electric line from his
home, where his wife and baby daughter
await him, has made bis friends believe
that he has deserted them. He arew his
pay before leaving a week a?o to-night
and kissed the baby and his wife good-by,
saying that he was goin? ont for a while.
Since then nothing has been seen or heard
of him.
To-day his wife stated tbat she knew no
reason for his sudden disappearance, tibe
I had not hearu from him and did not know
where he was. He was the oldest man on
the line and very industrious. He leaves
a few unpaid bills at the stores about bis

OAKLAND, CAi... Oct. 6.â The suit of
F. W. Morgan, ex-City Engineer, against
the city tor $1970 for work perform' d be
tween Aukusi 22, 1892, and June, 1893, on
the two sewers in the district on the
eastern shore of Lake Merritt was begun
to-day in Judge Frick's court. Tne city
denies its liability, claiming that no such
sewer system was ever contemplated; tbat
the Council never ordered such work;
that Morgan never went to such expense
for t. c city; that the claim is barred by
section 339 of the code of Civil Procedure,
and that when the claim was presented
there was no money in the city treasury
that was a revenue for the fiscal year of
1892 and 1893.
Mot "i/ove at First Sight."
OAKLAND, Cal. Oct. 6.â Not through
a period of several weeks, but of several
years, did the courtship of Leigh Beau
champ and MX- Amelia Kio.zen extend.
Ti.ese young people were married on Sun
day, and published accounts of the cere
mony embodied a romantic tale of "lore
at first sight" and streetcar â a betrothal
lollowing an accidental meeting. As a
matter of fact, declare the relatives ot the
bride, Mr. Beaucliamp and Miss Klotzen
became acquainted years ago, and when
he came to Oakland recently it was to lead
the young lady to the altar, according to
their prearranged plans.

WALTER HENLEY
KEPT HIS WORD
He Has Not Been Seen Since
He Threatened to Kill
Himself.
Let His Belongings and a Note
Saying He Was Tired
of Life.
SUPPOSED TO BE DROWNED.
After a Year's Vain Searching Ho Is
Honrned as Dead by His
Relatives.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 6.â The relatives
of Walter Henley, who disappeared sud
denly from his home, 2143 Encinai ave
nue, a year ago last August, have .-ntirely
lost hope of ever seeing tne young man
alive again. EvÂ«ry effort to locate him
has proved unavailable and the heart
broken parents have given up in despair.
Henley left home on a Friday, saying
that he was going fishing. As it was cus
tomary for h;m to stay away several days,
bis absence was not at first noticed, but as
the days passed his family began to make
inquiries. His room was opened, and on
the table lay bis pocket-book, watch,
knife and cane. There was also a note
giving directions in regard to certain
business transactions he was interested in,
stating where the necessary documents
were located. This was given publicity,
but the fact that he stated in the note
that he would do away with himself was
not given out and every denial possible
was made of any suicidal theory.
On August 3 following the remains of a
young man answering the description of
Hen ley were found on the ocean beach
near the Cliff House, taken to the Morgue,
marked unidentified, and later buried in
the potter's field. Nearly three weeks
later J. A. Siddon, a neighbor of the Hen
leys, decuied that the body was that of the
missing boy. He called at the Morgue,
and after examining the pictures among
the unknowns picked out that of the man
found on the beach as being Walter Hen
ley. The corpse had been terribly dis
figured and was scarcely recognizable, but
after a very careful examination Mr. Sid
don came to the concluson that the re
mains were those of Henley, and said he
would ask the Board of Health for per-,
mission to exhume them in order to be
sure.
Now Mr. Siddon and the other mem
bers of the family have changed their
opinions formed a year or more ago. They
did not exhume the remains, but gave
way to the opinion of Mrs. Siddon, a Bister
of the young man, who was positive that a
mis(ake bad been made. In speaking of
the disappearance yesterday, a member of
the family said: "Yes, we have given
Walter up entirely. Every effort was
made to locate him, but all hope has been
given up. Not a word have we had since
be disappeared. I am satisfied that the
body found shortly afterward upon the
beach in San Francisco was not his, and
so are the other members of the family.
He surely kept his word and did away
with himself."

ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 6.â The Board

His Dogs' Instinct.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oci. 6.â lt is said that
the cocker spaniels of Captain Hunter of
the wrecked Umatiila attracted general
attention on the ferry-boat Encinai on the
day of sailing of the Umaiilla. They al
ways accompany the captain across the
bay. On this occasion they persisted in
running to the stern of the boat, as if de
bating whether to jump off and attempt
to swim back to this city.
Captain Hunter called them to him sev
eral times, but they would return at once.
Those on the boat commented upon the
fact that they seemed to foretell an acci
dent. The captain seemed somewhat
net led, as his attention was continually
called to their action*, but he gave no in
dication that be thought it f ore bodo dan
ger to himself or his vessel.
Serious Charges Made.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 6.â The police
are again loi king for John F. Burrison a
warrant vworn to by John Gooby, who
charges him with obtninin money under
false pretenses. Gooby says Harris persuad
e't him to loan the former $160 upon an as
signed claim purporting to be assigned by
Mrs. Mary Guerine. It was a claim on
the estate of Guiseppe Cavagnaro, now in
course of probate. Gooby was to ret eive $50
for the loan. He became suspicious and
visited Mrs. Guerine, who informed him
that the assignment was fraudulent and
that the claim was on hie in tne County
Cierk's office. On a cearcn being made It
was tound missinn, and later was found
in the hands â  f Jake Raver, a Ban Fran
cisco collector, who says Burris assigned
it to him. Burns will have to answer for
its disappearance from the court as well, if
he is caught.
The Forester*' Reception
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 6 âThe reception
to Dr. Oionhyatekha, the supreme chief
ranger of the Foresters, will be held la
the Armory on n xt Saturday night. This
will be the event of the year with the
members of the order, and every effort Is
being made to make it one to be long re
membered. Arrangements had been made
for Linderman's Opera-house, but that
place has neen let to the Republicans for
that night, so they decided upon Armory
Hall.
The first heard of Dr. Oronhyatpfcah,
who, by the way, is not only a born Cana
dian, but also a full-blooded Indian, and
one as loyal to his blood as to his country
and the great order i c represents, he was
practicing medicine in London, Ont. By
carrying the same energy and enthusiasm
inio Forestry that he had into the practice
of his profession, he was soon elected to
the office of high chief ranger of the
province, and in this capacity showed sucn
steadiast devotion to the order that he at
tracted the entire Forestric world and was
rewarded by the highest office within the
gift of the order, that of supreme chief
ranger.
In Masonry Dr. Oronhyatekah has re
ceived the degrees of the Royal Arch
Chapter, Knights Templar, thirty-third
degree in the Scottish rite and that of tne
Mystic Shrine, and is also M,ost Worship
ful Grand Master Mason of the Dominion
of Royal and Oriental Masonry.
A Practical Joke.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 6.â The friends
of Miss Mabel Williams of Alameda ave
nue are enioyii.g a huge joke they played
upon her yesterday afternoon which
caused her to summon two policemen to
tho house. While calling at the house
one of them secreted her jewelry and
other valuables. On going to her room
later she missed several pieces of jewelry
and a casual glance showed that she had
lost everything. She at once telephoned
the police station and Officers Conrad and
Welch responded promptly. The neigh
borhood was thoroughly aroused by the
reported robbery, but Miss Williams was
greatly relieved to find her things hid in
the room during the investigation tbat
followed. Now she is looking for the
joker.

MADE A VICTIM
OF EVIL GOSSIP
Mrs Kelly of the Associa
ted Charities Cleared
of Blame.
Refus d to Again Take Office
Until the Directors Made
Full Inquiry.
JEALOUSY WAS THE CAUSE.
Rev. Dr. Chapman Dec-ares That
There Was No Foundation for
the Slanders.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
808 Broadway, Oct. 6. )
Mrs. Helen Kelly has been made the
victim of jealousy and misrepresentation,
but the directors of the Associated Chari
ties have declared that they have un
bounded confidence in her, and have reap
pointed her as secretary and superinten
dent.
For several months all kinds of little
stories have come to the directors' ears
about Mrs. Kelly's partialiiy and general
mismanagement, and it became necessary
to make an investigation so as to prevent
the good work of the association from
suffering.
The directors, nnder the supervision of
Rev. Dr. Chapman, the president, made a
full inquiry, and found that there was no
foundation for the charges and that they
were circulated by a lady whose name
they will not divulge.
So keenly did Mrs. Kelly feel her posi
tion thai she positively refused to again
accept the office of superintendent owing
to the opposition manifested in certain
directions to her work. At the meeting of
the directors they expressed themselves
as satisfied with her work and pleased
with her methods, and after they had
done so Mrs. Kelly agreed to continue in
the office, wiiich is one of great responsi
bility and very trying.
A few weeks ago some surprise was
manifested when an attempt was made to
induce the Council to cut the monthly ap
propriation for the Associated Charities
from $150 to $100. No complaint had ever
been made about the use to wiiich the
fund was applied, and Dr. Chapman ap
peared b fore the Council and succeeded
in persuading them that the amount was
not too large, or in fact large enough.
An investigation was made and the at
tempt to have the appropriation cut was
traced to the same source. The directors
unanimously disapproved such conduct
and iv ere l ou\l in theirdenunciations of the
party with whom it started.
"The petty jealousy that has been
shown by a lady from whom more honest
conduct was expected is very exasperat
ing," said a director to-night.
'â¢It is just a lot of gossip that began wHh
a lady who was ones an officer of the asso
ciation and who was not re elected. She
has misrepresented Mrs. Kelly, and has
done all possible to retard her work, and
it is disprac eful that such a thing should
be. Dr. Bodle, who has interested himself
in having the appropriation reduced, hns
toid us that he was induced to do so by
the same party that has made all the mis
chief. He did not know of these affairs at
the time, but he has changed his mind
since."
THEY PLYED FAST BULL
Snappy GamÂ° Between the U C.
and the Relianc? Football
Teams.
A Coalition B- w en the Republican
Clubs of Berkeley to Be
Formed.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct aâ The uni
versity football team and the Reliance
Club eleven held a lively practice game
this afternoon on the Berkeley fieid.
About thirty minutes was spent in snappy,
vigorous work. The Reliance team lined
up in practically the same manner as they
did last Saturday in the game with Berke
ley at Central Park, while the University
team was comprised of an almost entirely
new lot of men. Fumbles were numerous
on both sides, and euch team lost the ball
to the other several times on downs. Tne
Reliance team made their best gains on
bucking the line, while Berkeley ran the
end' and kicked the pigskin almost en
tirely.
Wnlton of the Reliance made two bril
liant runs from his position at right half,
and Oliver broke Berkeley's line several
tmes .rom his position at iruar i, poinz
through it like a pile-driver. Toland and
Smythe at ends and Ludlow as . uard
made the plays of the afternoon for Berke
ley by their clevr tackles.
The Reliance team will probably come
out again on Thursday afternoon for an
other practice game.

HUNTED WITH INDIANS,
Travels and Adventures of Zske
Miller, an ex-Messenger
Boy.
He Is Now in the City Prison Booked
for Some Public Institu
tion.
Zeke Miller until a month or five weeks
ago wa a a messenger-boy with the San
Francisco District Telegraph Company.
Since then he has undergone a varied
experience and is now in the City Prison,
booked for some public institution.
Zeke is 14 years of age and a bright,
handsome boy, with light curly hair and
big, frank eyes. He lived with his mother
and stepfather, Samuel Miller, at 2903
Pine street. Miller is a gripman on the
Sutter-street cable road. Zeke'sreal name
is Eddy, but when Miller married his
mother after his father's death about
eleven years ago he adopted Miller's
name.
About five weeks ago Zeke had a row
wiih the daughter of. a neighbor. His
mother took the girl's part and Zeke got
disgusted and made up his mind to run
away from home and start out for himself.
In the City Prison -last night he told his
story. "I had saved up some money out
of my wages," he said, "and bought a
ticket for iJeihany, San Joaquin County,
where William Alexander, a friend of the
family, Had a ranch. When I got there
Alexander was just selling out, and he
was sending a wagon-load of fruit and
other things to a place in Texas. I forget
the name of the place, but Indians live
around there.
"I secreted myself in the car, as Alex
ander told me that Texas would be a good
place for me, and for five or six days, till
the car reached there, I lived on fruit I
enjoyed the trip greatly.
"When tne car reached its destination I
got acquainted witn some Indians, who
took a tancy and were very kind to me. I
lived with them for two weeks and went
hunting for deer with them. They taught
me to shoot, and before the end of the
two weeks I was able to bring down a deer
myself.
"I got homesick, and they made up a
purse to pay my tare back. I reached
here Monday, and called upon some
friends, who advised me to go home. I
went there, and my mother bad a talk
with my stepfather about taking me
back, but he 'kicked' against it, so this
morning mother took me to the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children,
and here I am. I suppose I will be sent
to the Youths' Directory."
A MILITARY COMPLIMENT
Banquet to Be Tendered to Gen
eral William M. Graham,
U. S. A.
M.eting of National Guard Officers
to Arrange for the
Event
A meeting of National Guard officers
was held last evening at General J. H.
DicKint=on's offices in the telephone build
ing to consider the spontaneous sugges
tion of giving a dinner in honor of Gen
eral William M. Graham, TJ. 8. A. Among
the officers attending were General Dick
inson, Colonels William Macdonald,
Thomas F. Barry, D. E. Miles, Thomas
Cluff, H. P. Bush, Wiiliam Edwards,
James Smith, Maiors Willis Dodd, Charles
T. Stanley, Charles Jansen, Captains
Marshall, Margo, Sutliffe Filmer and
Lieutenant L. Barrere. This attendance
embraced a representative of the staffs of
Major-General N. T. James and Brigadier-
General R. H. Warfield.
The proposition to give General Graham
the parting compliment of a banquet re
ceived instant and unanimous commenda-
tion.
General Dickinson was appointed a com
mittee of one to wait upon General
Graham and tender the invitation. Should
the latter accept General Dickinson will
report the acceptance at a meeting to be
held at 1 o'clock to-morrow auernoon,
when the time and place of the dinner will
be designaied.
A commutes was appointed to inter
view officers of the National Guard who
were not present at the meeting last
evening.
It is understood that General Graham
leaves for Nuw York with the Second Bat
talion ot the fifth Artillery on the 15th
inst. Officers of tne National Guard of
California as well as those serving in the
United States army re. ard General Gra
ham, w.'io ha* been promoted and brevet ted
for meritorious conduct on the fields of
Antietam and Gettysburg, as an ideal
American soldier. It was the sentiment
of the meeting last night tbat the National
Guard should embrace this occasion to
honor the worthy veteran.
There is nothing more soothing in case
of nervous restlessness than a hot salt
bath just before retiring.

SQUABBLE OVER TAXES.
The Southern Pac fie Seeks to
Collect ao Old Debt From
the A. and P.
Master in Chancery Appointed to
Adjust a Claim for Fitty Thou
sand Dollars.
An interesting railroad case which prac
tically dates back some eight years was
heard before United States Circuit Court
Judge Ross on Monday. The suit in ques
tion is that of the United States Trust
Company against the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad and others to foreclose a mort
gage of $16,000,000 held by the former.
Incidentally there is fight on between C.
W. Smith, receiver of the Atlantic and
Pacific road, and the Southern Pacific, in
volving back taxes to the amount of
$48,000.
Among the visiting legal fraternity pres
ent were C. N. Sterry of Albuquerque, N.
Mex., representing the receiver of tne At
lantic and Pacific; Neill B. Fuller of Albu
querque and Judge Hutton of Los An
geles in behalf of the United States Trust
Company, trustees of the first mortgage
bonds of the Atlantic and Pacific, and
Charles Munroe, representing the Mer
cantile Trust Company, trustee of the sec
ond mortgage bonds of the same road.
The first matter considered was a motion
by the United States Trust Company's
attorney for a decree ordering the sale of
the road. Judse Ross appointed O. N.
Marron of Albuquerque as master in
chancery to appraise the road and report
to the court as soon as this duty was
complete. It is generally thought the
road will be sold by January. It is not
believed that the Santa Fe system will be
come the purchaser, but they will probably
effect a close traffic arrangement with the
buyers.
The real interest in the suit, however,
centers in the intervention proceedings
instituted by the Southern Pacific to com
pel the receiver of the Atlantic and Pacific
road to pay back taxes amounting to
$43,000. The facts in the case may be
briefly told as follows:
The line between Mojave and Needles is
operated by the Atlantic and Pacinc road,
but owned by tne Southern Pacific. It
was a part of the contract that the first
named corporation should pay the taxes.
It seems that they failed to do this in the
year 1888, compelling the Southern Pacific,
after long legal proceedings, to pay the
same. It seems that the United States Trust
Company interposed an objection to the
payment by Receiver Smith of the sum
demanded. This latter gentleman ap
peared yesterday through his attorney, C.
N. Sterry, and assed the court to instruct
him as to his duty in the premises.
Judge Ross appointed H. S. Warren of
Albuquerque as master in chancery to de
termine the facts in the case.
. . .
HERMAN MEN IN COURT.
Continuance of Ten Days Granted to
Examine the Complaint.
The case of the crew of the otter hunt
ing schooner Herman vs. the Pacific Trad
ing Company was called in the United
States District Court yesterday and went
over for ten days at the request of the de
fendants. Mr. Hutton, for the sailors,
made a vigorous protest, pointing out that
hi 3 clients were without means and that
a continuance meant starvation for them
unless they accepted the money offered by
the company.
Judge Morrow considered the matter for
a few moments and then decided that the
defense was entitled to a delay in order to
examine the complaint and file an answer.
When the Herman docked tne trouble
began, and at that time The Call stated
that the mate had given A. P. L,orentzen,
agent for the vessel, a pair of black eyes.
This was published under a misapprehen
sion, as while there was a wordy warfare
and the police were called in there was
not a semblance of a blow struck.
Labor Notes.
At a meeting of the Plasterers' Union Monday

TIME CALLED ON
THE THEATER HUT
Drop Curtains Might Be
Used to Banish It
From View.
Novel Suggestion Made by an
Actress Which Provoked
Many Smiles.
AGE LIMIT TO REGULATE.
Managers Have Not Followed the
Example of the Baldwin Tet
and May Not Do So.
"Ladies 85 years old and upward will be
permitted to wear their hats in this thea
ter. Younger ladles will please remove
their hats."
That is the inscription which a witty and
somewhat satirical actress has proposed
for the adornment of the drop-curtains of
every theater in San Francisco.
"That would take off the theater hats
and permit the general public to see us,"
said this actress.
Would it ? The managers of all theaters
admit that it would be a good move if all
the ladies would take off their hats while
attending performances. The size of this
"if" is undetermined. They all hailed the
suggestion of the thirty-five year limit
last evening with hilarity. Their glee
ranged from a somewhat elastic smile to
a resonant hal ha!
The hats came off at the Baldwin Thea
ter again last night; much as on the pre
ceding night. On all sides the people in
the seats who were enabled to see the stage
asked tnat the. choicest blessings might
fall on all who were concerned in inducing
this blissful condition. The people on the
stage beamed in the consciousness that at
last they were visible to all the audience,
and that no cartwheel-like aggregation of
hat brim, flaring feathers and projecting
ribbons would blur the vision of any man
or woman in the house.
Some of the ladies in attendance at
otner theaters voluntarily removed their
hats, in the absence of any request by the
management in that direction. These
ladies could have had any political office
in the gift of the people present and would
have been certain that ail other citizens
who attend plays at any time, including
all the Judges of the Supreme Court,
would have ratified the choice, on the
ground that if the law did not make the
election legal then it is so much worse for
the law.
Mr. Gott'ob of the Columbia Theater
said that the removal of hats by the ladies
was a strong indication ot good sense. He
would say, IE fact, that it would be a good
thing if all the hats were voluntarily re
moved. Undoubtedly the big theater hats
are a nuisance. It is difficult to success
fully dictate what a lady shall do in this
matter, but he hoped that the day is not
far away when all ladies will think as he
does. No rule has been made at the
Columbia, and probably none will be, re
ferring to the wearing of hats.
Oliver Morosco said at the Grand Opera
house that no rule would be made tnere.
The Grand Opera-nouse is a family the
ater distinctively, and it woul'l be unwise
to ask the ladies to come hatless or to re
move tneir hats and sit bareheaded during
the play. It would be well if the hats
were not worn.
Mr. Walter of the Orpheum said that
nothing l:ad been done at his place of
amusement concerning the wearing of
ladies' hats. If the Indies will agree to sit
without their hats during the performance
that would surely tie a good thing, but it
all rests with the ladies to do what they
desire.
No rule has been made at the Tivoli nor
at the Alcazar, nor is there any immediate
prospect that one will be devised to cur
tail or in any way interfere with the hats
ladies may wear into their precincts. The
regulation of the circumference of such
appendages will depend entirely upon the
wearers thereof. The developments of the
season which has opened are sure to be
watched ai home and elsewhere with in
terest, for the conditious are reversed, and
the wearing of big theater hats less con
cerns the ladies than it does downtrodden
man, who can dodge a runaway trolley
car easier than he can keep bobbing
aiound to catch the view shut eff by the
periphery of a phenom hat.
GAVE NINE DECISIONS,
The United States Court of Ap
peals Gets to Work
Again.
The Court Decides That Wong Fong
Is a Merchant and Entitled
to Remain Here.
The United States Court of Appeals for
the ninth circuit held its first session for
the October term yesterday. Altogether
nine decisions were handed down. Judce
McKenna dissenting in the case of Har
vey M. and Ida B. Lichtz, plaintiffs in
eiror. vs. Joseph R. and Mary A. Lewis,
defendants in error, in an action for eject
ment.
Another case of particular importance
to insurance people is that of the action
brought by Eliza M. Frazer against the
Standard Life and Accident Company, to
recover $4000 on a policy issued on the iife
of Henry L. Fraser. The insurance com
pany set up the claim that Fraser had ob
tained the policy b}' misrepresentation. It
seems that he was proprietor of a saloon,
but did not regularly tend the bar, bu;
that on one occasion he did tend bar,
p.nding the return of his regular man
from lunch, and while shaking dice with
a customer became engaged in a quarrel,
during which he lost his life. The com
pany refused payment, whereupon the
wife brought suit in the United States
Circuit Court of Washington and obtained
judgment for the amount claimed. The
Circuit Court of Appeals, ihrou^h Judges
Gilbert, Ross and Hawley, affirm the de
cision of the lower court, with costs to the
defendant in error.
Wong Fong of Riverside obtained a de
cided victory over the Government in an
action for deportation brought two years
ai:o. It appears that Fong owned a store
near Riverside and that while in China on
a visit the property was destroyed. He re
turned to America, finally landing on pre
sentation of proof that he was a mer
chant. Later he was arrested and, being
without a certificate, was held for de
portation. It was shown in the lower
court that the store had been rebuilt, but
Fong's interest in the same was not per
fectly clear. He was therefore ordered
returned to China. The Court of Appeals
now holds that the evidence offered by
P'onc was conclusive as to his being a
merchant, hence he had an unquestioned
right to remain in this country.
The remaining cases with decisions of
the court may be briefly summarized aa
follows:
Pacific Coast steamship Company appel
lant vs. Eben W. Ferguson et al. appellees
(Northern District of California). Judg
ment aiiirmed.
Chester H. Kerlil, as receiver of tbe
South Bend Water Corapanv, plaintiff in

Central Railway Company appellees (Dis
trict of Montana). Judgment affirmed.
J. R. Marks plaintiff in error vs. North

appellees (Northern Division District of

John M. Klein plaintiff in error vs. city
of Seattle, defendant in error (Northern

ment affirmed.
WAS SHE PREJUDICED?
Frank iiobey's Ex- Wife Sues His Estate
on a Peculiar Contract.
The trial of the suit of Mary E. Det
tricii, formerly Mary E. Gobey, divorced
wife of Frank Gobey. against the estate of
her ex-husband, was begun in Judge
Hunt's .court yesterday.
Gobey and the plcintiff were divorced in
1880, when the custody of their child â a
little girl, was given to the mother. An
agreement wÂ«tf made between the two in
1883, by the terms of which the little one
was to be sent to Gobey's sister in Canada,
to be educated and there remain until 18
years of age. It was stipulated that the
child was not to be prejudiced against
either of its parants and was to be re
turned at the expiration of the contract to
the mother. A clause was inserted in the
contract, however, by the terms or which
Gobey agreed to forfeit $1000 in case all
the specifications of the agreement were
not carried out. It is under this clause
that the suit is brought.
Williams in the City.
Dick Williams will prcbably be released on
bail to-day. He was brought over from San
Quentin yesterday afternoon, with a view to
being released immediately, but there was a
latal hitch in the bentf offjred. It appears
that the bondsmen do not own any property
in this district, all their wealth lying in the
counties of Tulare and Los Angeles. Williams'
attorney says he will have no difficulty in se
curing the proper sureties to-day.

FATHER FLOOD
READY TO BUILD
The Imposing Edifice for
the Sacred Heart
Parish.
It Will Be of Brick and Stone
and an Ornament to the
City.
DIGNIFIED CLASSIC BEAUTY.
Construction Will Be Commenced
Without Delay and Pushed to
Completion.
It will be only a matter of a very short
time now until the Sacred Heart parish
will have an imposing church at the south
east corner of Fell and Fillmore streets.
This c ifice, its builders say, will rank
among the best monumental buildings of
San Francisco and will be an ornament to
the City. From its commanding location
at the top of an eminence it will be seen
from almost all parts of town and its lofty
to<*er will be one of the familiar land
marks.
The Rev. James Flood, pastor of the Sa
cred Heart parish, has decided to build his
new church of buff Roman brick with
terra cotta trimmings, and stone columns
at the vestibule. The Italian renaissance
style, combining imposing outlines with
simplicity of detail, so as to be very effect
ive, has been selected.
It is the intention to build at present
only so much of the church as can be
erected without interfering with the ex
isting church and to build the remaining
portion as the funds become available.
Construction will be commenced immedi
ately.
The church will be classic in outline and
details and the principal leature will be a
tower 120 feet ljih on the north west corner
of the building. Tn is tower is in the Italian
campanile style, and is at once simple ana
effective, throughout the design the aim
has been to get an effective outline with
out excessive ornamentation.
The main portico at the west front is 40
feet long and 26 feet high, and is sup
ported by four. stone columns, between
which columns are the three entrances to
the vestibule, all inclosed by handsome
wroughtiron gates. The church will be
155 feet long 61 feet wide and 49 feet
high.
The interior is designed specially with a
view of future decorations. Pilasters with
Corinthian caps divide the side walls and

Corner of Fell and Fillmore Streets.
[From the architect's sketch.]
support a cornice and frieze, and above
this cornice springs an eight-foot cove,
dying into ceiling.
The side windows are m one length and
are intended to be filled with memorial
glass in the future. A large rose window
fills the end of the sanctuary.
A basement 61 feet by 71 feet and 12 feet
high is formed under the east end of the
church, and owing to the grade on Fell
street the greater portion of the basement
IB above ground and a good entrance is
obtained by descending a few steps from
the sidewalk.
A special effort has been made to obtain
an efficient system of ventilation. By
means of ducts the foul air is drawn from
every poition of the building to two foul
air rooms in the attic and thence expelled
by mechanical means. A sufficient fresh
air supply is provided, and it is calculated
to cuange the air every twelve minutes.
The plans have been prepared by T. J.
Welsh, the arcnitec\ The estimated cst

BUCKMAN'S LEASE.
He Will Locate His Camp for Ten Tears
Near the Head of Guerrero Street.
The meeting of the Guerrero-street Im
provement Association, which had been
announced to take place at 134 Guerrero
street last night, will not be held until to
morrow night.
"This association has been formed,"
eaid H. Hoffman, a prominent member of
the organization, "for the purpose of pro
tection, and improvement of the district
The main purpose was to prevent the lo
cation on the block bounded by Four
teenth and Fifteanth, Dolores and Guer
rero streets, of the Buckman camp of
graders, which some lime ago was de
clared a nuisance. The peop:e of this
district fee! alarmed that the location of a
camp against which the Health Depart
ment made a declaration should be
made here. They fear that it would en
gender disease and depreciate the value of
property. To-day a committee of this
association called on Mr. -Mangel, who
has the control of the block in which it is
proposed to establish this camp, and it
waÂ« informed that the land had been
leased to Buckman for ten years. I
hardly know what can be done, but that
may be determined at the meeting on ;
Thursday.
"The association will seek to have Four
teenth street, between Dolores and Guer
rero, which waa cut through a short time |
ago and is now impassable, put ii: good i
conuition, besides looking after other im- â¢
provements to be considered in the :
future."

Local Tickets Receive the
Attention of Two So

Interesting Proceedings of the Mc-
Kinley Veterans' League Last
Night.
There is a great deal of activity among
the various Republican clubs of the City.
The United Labor party and the McKin
ley Veterans' League are particularly in
earnest.
Tne convention of the United Labor
party met again last evening in Sniiley's
Hall, Valencia street, and listened to a
report from the committee appointed at
its last meeting to interview and report
npon the candidates to be indorsed by the
convention.
The following candidates were favorably
reported npon by the committee and
unanimously indorsed by the convention:
Mayor, C. L. Taylor; Auditor, William
A. Deane; Treasurer, A. C. Widber; Su
perintendent of Streets, G. W. Elder; Tax
Collector, Cord H. Wetjen; City and
County Attorney, John R. Aiken; City
and County Surveyor, Charles S. Tilton*;
Judges Superior Courtâ Carroll Cook, John
Hu.it, Judge Sanderson ; Supervisor First
Ward, John Hayes; Supervisor Eighth
Ward, Frank ConJclm; Board of Educa
tionâDr. G. I. Drucker, Dr. J. H. Soper;
Assemblyman Thirty-fourth District, 8. L.
Lent.
The chairman of the committee, S. M.
Williams, siaied that the committee ex
pected to* have the entire ticket com-
pleted by to-morrow (Wednesday) even
ing, and that the petition would be filed
with the Registrar Saturday.
Frank Roney, the oreanizer and first
president of the Federated Trades of this
City, addressed the convention at some
length. He said it bad always been a sub
ject of wonder to him how work.ngmen,
and particularly trades unionists, whose
basic principles were protection, could in
any numbers be found on the side of free
trade, or any propositions tending in that
direction.
Men joined labor organizations, he said,
because as individuals they were unable
to advance their interests otherwise. Yet
these same men often most inconsistently
clamor and strike for higher wages and co
into the eh ape&t markets to purchase
their necessities, ignoring the fact that
cheap poods meant reduced wages.
Higher wnges produced a plenitude of
money and It made little difference what
kind it was provided there was always
enough. He hoped the United Labor
party was a party of protection, otherwise
he would collider himself much out of
place. Mr. Roney's remarks were listened
to with marked attention and his address
freauently punctuated with applause.
After short speeches by G. W. Elder,
Cord Wetjen, L^eon Jones, William A.
Deane and S. L. Lent the convention ad
journed to the call of the chair.
A large and enthusiastic meetin? of the
McKinley Veterans' League of the Fifth
Congressional District was held last even
ing at Swiss Hall, Fourteenth and Mis
sion streets, Colonel E. McCormick pre

Whereas, George W. Elder, the faithful ex

Peralta, in which he dwelt upon the
known fidelity of the Spanish-speaking
citizens to the Republican party, and
prophesied a continuance of that fidelity
during the forthcoming elections.
Edward Sweeny gave some humorous
recitations, and between the speeches)
songs popular and patriotic were ren
dered by Messrs. Silva, Clark, Bernard,
McGrath and others.

Boston, Mass., Sept. 39, 1896.
Glorious suggestion. We co-operate heartily.
John Willis Baeb.
The following communication was sent

ANNIE CON ROY'S DEATH.
The Young Lady Did Not Commit Sui
cide, but Made a Mistake in
Taking Medicine.
The statements published yesterday
morning to the effect that Miss Annie
Conroy had committed suicide are posi
tively denied by her sister Lizzie, her
father, and also by her brother-in-law,
J. T. Wiseman, who resides at 506b Turk
street. They have authorized Clay W.
Taylor to make the following statement of
the facts in the case:
The young lady, Annie Conroy, was a
sufferer from heart disease and rheuma
tism. She procured from Mrs. Jb'errali, the
landlady at 532 Jessie street, two bottles of
medicine, the contents of one to be taken
inwardly and the other for outside appli
cation. The same kind of medicine had
brought relief to the landlady's niece and
so Mrs. Ferrall prescribed it for Miss Con
roy.
J. C. St. John was sent for Monday with
reference to a business proposition. He
was in no sense the lover or beloved of
Mi?s Annie Conroy. The business with
him pertained to a negotiation for a loan
of money. The Conroy ladies owned tim
ber land in Shasta County and desired to
pledge that property as security for a loan
to enable them to establish a lodging
house here. Of this land-ownership Clay
W. Taylor is familiar. During the inter
view Miss Annie Conroy reached for her
medicine and took a dose. Immediately
after she swallowed it she exclaimed to
her sister: "Oh, Lizzie, I have made a
mistake and taken the wrong medicine!"
Her sister Lizzie ran for salt and at once
directed Bt. John to run tor a doctor.
When Dr. Fitch iirnved he found the girl
unconscious and had her sent to the Re
ceiving Hospital, where she died Tuesday
evening.
The family is greatly grieved over the
publication of stories vhat the young lady
took her own life by design, and desire
that the widest publicity should be given
to the denial.
STRIKERS ENJOINED.
Union Bakers Commanded Not to Inter
fere With the Men at
Work.
The trouble between Davitt & Daly,
who ran bakeries in different portions of
the City, employing non-union men, and
the American Bakers' Union No. 51 cul
minated yesterday in tne first named get
ting out an injunction, commanding the
union ana its members to refrain from in
terfering with the business or employes of
the plaintiffs.
For a long time past the union has been
boycotting Davitt & Daly and has dis
tributed handbills asking people not to
patronize them. It in also claimed that
the union men have threatened to assault
the other "workmen and have in every pos
sible way made life miserable for them.
Judge Murphy issued the injunction.
HE WOULD NOT PAY.
An Attorney Who Took Refuge Behind
the Statute of .Limitations.
J. B. Sh rrard, who testified that he was
an attorney and employed in the United
States District Attorney's office, took ref
uge behind the statute of limitations in
lustice Groezinger's court yesterday to es
cape paying lor a suit of clothes.
Sherrard bought a suit from a Market
street tailor in April, 1894, agreeing to pay
$45 for it. For some reason the claim was
not pressed until lately, and then suit was
begun. On the stand yesterday, when the
atiorney for the plaintiff, J. J. Kauer,
asked about the matter, Sherrard admitted
owing the bill, but stated that as the law
protected him he would decline to pay.
Theodore Lynch Lectures.
The Jewish branch of the Socialist
Labor party was addressed at Its agita
tion meeting at 970 Folsom street last
night by Theodore Lynch, secretary of the
Liberty Branch, and member of the State Ex
ecutive Committee of the party on the subject
of "The Empire of Greed and the Kingdom of
Unselfishness." The address of the evening
was preceded by an open-air meeting.
Three Big Expoaitloma.
The California Btate Board of Trade will
hold its regular meeting next Tuesday, and
the principal matter to be discussed will be
whether or not California will be represented
in the big international expositions ol 1897.
Expositions or fairs will De held in Hamburg,
Guatemala and Nashville, Term. A large
number of people are desirous of having the
State send exhibits to all three events.
HOLLADAY WILL
RESIST THE BOARD
Supervisors Warned Not to
Try to Grade Lafay
ette Park.
A Claim Made That the Land in
Question Is Private
> Property.
PEDDLERS' LICENSE ORDER.
The Provision Requiring the Wearing
of Tags G es Back to the
Committee.
The threat of an injunction brought one
proposed action of the Board of Super
visors to a sudden stop yesterday. It bad
been decided in committee to advocate
the grading of Washington street, between
Gough and Octavia, where it runs along
in front of Lafayette Park, in spite of the
protest of S. W. Holladay, who claims
that the portion of the park affected is
private property. At the last moment a
formal communication, of which the fol
lowing is a portion, was served on the
board : ,
I tnink it proper that your honorable board
should be informed and notified, as you are
now hereby informed and notified, that the
land in question is private properly; it is not
within or a part of any public park or reserva
tion, and yon and your employes, agents and
contractors are now hereby forbidden to enter
upon or meddle with said land by grading it
or otherwise, and that any interference with
it will be resisted. 8. W. Holladat.
Under the circumstances the matter
waÃ laid over for a week to give the com
mittee a cance (or further investigation.
The Panhandle and Ashbury Heights
Improvement Club petitioned for the re
scinding of the resolution permitting the
Park Commissioners to extend the fences
of Golden Gate Park to the outer line of
the sidewalks of Fell, Oak, Stanyan. Ful
ton, D and H streets.
Owners of property south of Twentieth
street, on Folsom, sent in a petition re
questing the board to compel the Market
street Railroad Company to extend its
line on Folsom street to the Precita-avenue
terminus, as called for by its franchise.
Supervisor King introduced a resolution
repealing sections 2. 3 and 4 of the ped
dlers' license ordinance, requiring peddlers
to wear license tags.
It was expected that the author of the
license measure. Supervisor Dimond,
would resist the passage of the resolution,
but he did the contrary, supporting the
matter after it bad oeen seconded by Su
pervisor Taylor. The final decision of tne
board was that the Committee on License
ana Order should again investigate the
necessity of the tags.
A resolution was adopted requesting
Mayor Sutro to take steps to force the con
tractors who were awarded the work of
tearing away the foundations of the old
City Hall to carry out their agreement at
once.
The position of Chauncey F. Cooper, a
janitor in the City Hall force, was declared
vacant
JOE KELLY'S ROAST.
Will Turn the Tables on the Examiner
To-Morrow Night.
One of tne joyous features of this com
plicated campaign will be Joseph P.
Kelly's own mass-meeting at Metropolitan
Temple to-morrow night.
Kelly, the regular Democratic oandidate
for Congress in the Filth District, has
tired somewhat of the misrepresentations
and the uncalled-for partisan abuse which
the Examiner has been showering upon
him in the progress of its fight fur the un
known Populist fusion candidate, and he
has hired Metropolitan hall for to-mor
row evening for the express purpose of
paying his respects to the Examiner as a
faking newspaper, and to Mr. Hearst as a
man and a journalist of much uuworth.
Mr. Kelly, it is understood, will say
some highly interesting things in bis an
swer to the Examiner and some of the
people who run it. He has some mat
ters of history to present, and it is vaguely
hinted by some of Kelly's friends that he
may talk about Mr. Hearst in fully as per
sonal a way as Mr. Hearst has talked about
him.
John D. Grady, late of Fresno, its poli
tics and its McWhirter case, will also
speak from the stage; and Mr. Grady, it
is said, will have some things of consid
erable interest and force to say.
Altogether, the big anti-Examiner meet
ing at Metropolitan Hall to-morrow night
promises to be one of the most interesting
mats-meetings of this present campaign,
ana the big hall will probably be crowded
as densely as it ever has been in its cam
paign history.
Mr. Kelly's experience is also a very fair
illustration of the degree of political in
fluence exercised by tne Examiner, the
nondescript "organ," generally repudiated
by the Democrats, which is making the
candidate of the Democrats of the Fifth
District the subject of a daily roast, while
it tries to boost into Congress a good
natured Populist health inspector namea
Kinne, who was nomited by Cator and
Wardeil instead of the people of the dis
trict.
Five small politicians controlled by a
small clique turned down Kelly after be
was selected by the people in the Demo
cratic way by a regular convention. This
little political job has been warmly backed
by the Examiner, but it is daily more ap
parent that the job and the Examiner are
being repudiated by the Democrats of the
district who do not relish being sold out.
Ou last Saturday the Democratic County
Committee of San Mateo County held a
meeting at which all the sixteen members
were present. The following resolutions
were adopted by a heartily unanimous
vote:
Whereab, The Hon. Joseph P. Kelly is the
regular nominee for Congress in tne Fifth
Congressional District, in whose nomination
the Si ate representatives of the Democracy of
this county favorably participated; therefore,
belt
Resolved, That in justice to the sentiments of
the Democracy of San Mateo County, as voiced
in the action of its representatives, Joseph P.
Kelly be recommended to the Democratic
citizens of this county for their recognition
and support.
This is an interesting indication of the
successful progress of the fusion deal and
nf the influence of the "party organ." Mr.
Kelly is receiving similarly hearty sup
port in Santa Clara County and in San
Francisco from Democrais generally who
understand that the Examiner has mo
tives of its own and that it is "dumping"
the party this year as it has generally
done before.
Windsor Castle has been used for a royal
residence for 786 years.
