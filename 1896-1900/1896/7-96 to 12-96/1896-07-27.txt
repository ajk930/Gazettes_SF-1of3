The Young Orator Ridiculed as

"Pretty Man."
RECORD OF THE GEORGIAN.
Once Created an Uproar in the House
by Accusing Members of
Drunkenness.
"WASHINGTON, D. C, July 26.â The
nomination of Tom Watson of Georgia as
a running mate with Bryan on the Popu
list ticket is regarded with derision in
Washington, where Watson is best known.
It is recalled that Bryan and Watson,
when members of the Fifty-second Con
gress, were often pitted against each
other in debate. Indeed, the Georgia
Populist seemed to feel an especial ani
mosity toward Bryan and vented his
spleen whenever opportunity offered. The
two men are as different as possible in
both physical and mental mateup. Bryan,
a gifted orator, a man of commanding
presence and a fine voice, always had the
sympathy of fellow members and Of the
galleries, which greatly irritated his ad
versary. Watson is a typical "corn-crack
er."' His physical appearance is utterly
insignificant and strongly reminds one of
"Ransy Sniffle," described .in Judge Long
street's Georgia scenes as a native of
Georgia, who had been reared on a diet of
red clay and blackberries:'
Watson was an aggressive Congressman,
impetuous and intemperate in his utter
ances and seemed never .happy unless be
was fomenting trouble in the House of
Representatives. When the tariff bill was
being considered, he sought to show that
Bryan was insincere in his tariff-for-rev
enue professions. He paid his compli
ments to Bryan in this fashion:
On the other hand, we have our handsome and
brilliant friend from Nebraska (Bryan), who
was put forward as the "darling" of the Demo
cratic side of the house, the prettiest man In
all the bunch, and his entire j speech, which
ranged -^ from Tom Aloe-* 1 - poetry to Joe
Miller's jest book, was ttw- â and substance
of the old Democratic -position on the tariff
that "We will practice what is wrong, while
we know what is right." .
After, a burst of laughter Watson pro
ceeded to the serious features of the tariff,
but soon returned to Bryan, and con
tinued :
He announced his ideal Democratic plat
form, not a platform you would have, but a
platform you should haveâ a platform you
could have if a man were sitting quietly by
bis fire at night with his feet in his slippers,
cigar in his month, a hot | toddy by his side,
nothing to disturb him, and ideal Democratic
dreams in bis heart.' Now, what was that plat
form? It was very pretty. It has all the vague
charms of the undefined. It has all the bound
less beauty of a landscape that has no limit.
He says this phrase, ''tariff for protection," is
the only thing of which he complains. He
says, in effect: "I do not object to it if it does
by indirection what the other says fit should
do directly; but I object to a tariff which says
in plain words what it is meant to do."
There was much laughter on the Repub
lican side. < Watson quoted some of
Bryan's glowing sentences and then
added :
That is beautiful. It Is like the old fish
trap, with one mouth down the stream and the
other up, and it catches 'em a comln' and a
goin\ [Great laughter.]
Watson finally made himself odious to
his fellow-members by writing a campaign
book, in which he accused Home of them
of incompetency, intemperance and venal
ity. On one hot July day General Wheeler
of Alabama arose to a question ' of privi
lege and read from the clerk's desk the
following paragraph from Watson's book:
Lack of common business prudence was never
more glaring. Drunken members have reeled
about the aisles, a . disgrace â to the Republic.
Drunken speakers have debated grave issues
on the floor, and in the midst of maudlin
ramblings have been heard to ask, "Mr.
Speaker, where am I at?"
General Wheeler then proceeded to ar
raign Watson for his statements. Watson
tried to make an explanation, but was
howled down. This angered him and he
bellowed, loudly: ,
I want it to be understood that no Repre
sentative from New York can bulldoze me In
the exercise of my rights on this floor. He
may as well understand that now. I stand
here to defend every line in the book, and will
do it again s.t att comers, whether from the
North or South. [Hisses.] I say that every
word in that book is literally true, and all
men wuo have been keeping their eyes open
and wanting to admit the facts will admit
these facts as fairly stated.
A scene of confusion followed, and Wat
son was calle i to order, but by a vote of
139 to 25, was allowed to proceed as
follows:
I ask no grace from a Democratic majority
which seeks to hiss me down when I am
defending my character on this floor. I scorn
your grace. I scorn your mercy. The only
crime charged in that paragraph, which a
Democrat takes offense at, is that he got drunk
al the barroom this congress allows to be run
in the basement, and the record shows that
members came up here on a previous day and
admitted that they were drinkers at it. You
have planted the tree, why should you wonder
at its fruit?
Loud protests were now beard from all
parts of the chamber, and the House voted
against allowing him to proceed. Watson
frequently gave utterance to incendiary
sentiments. He was one of the strongest
advocates for an investigation of the
Pinkertons, and it was during the discus
sion of a resolution to this effect that he
used the following language:
We are on the eve of a social outbreak. We
are at the crisis oi our republican govern
ment. In a few months it vill be decided
whether we have a Government of law and or
der, whether peace can be maintained by the
constituted authorities, or whether each side
will arm itself with the deadliest weapon of
destruction and fight out their grievances.

WINSLOW STEPS OUT.
The Democratic Nominee for Governor of
Maine Resigns.
PORTLAND, Mi., July 26.â 1n a letter
ol withdrawal given out to-night by Hon.
Howard B. Winslow of this city, who last
month was nominated as the Democratic
candidate for Governor, he says :
The platform adopted by the State conven
tion, which has declared for a single gold
standard, is plain, and it was upon that plat
form that I was nominated, and I could not,
even had I so desired, have accepted this
nomination under any ; other , circumstances
than to stand firmly upon the platform made
by the Democratic party of Maine.
The Democratic National Convention
adopted a platform declaring for the free and
unlimited coinage of silver and , there was a
strong pressure brought to bear to have me
announce myself in favor of the National Con
vention, which I did not consider was right
to do. There have been , many expressions on
the part of the Democrats of Maine in regard
i to my duty, but it has been plain to jme at ail
times that there was but one thing for me to
do, and that was to stand firmly, by the Maine
platform. It is evident 1 from the free expres
sions of opinion. that if I. wish to secure tile
vote of the Democratic party I shall be obliged
to harmonize with both gold and silver plat
forms, and that I cannot do under any circum
stances.
A meeting of the State committee will
be held at once to take action o n this im
portant matter.
JONES VISITS BRYAN.
Earnest Conference on the Demo-Popu
listic Situation,
LINCOLN, Nebb., July 26. â Senator
Jones of Arkansas arrived in Lincoln this
evening and was immediately driven to
the residence of Mr. Bryan, where an ear
nest conference was held on subjects of
much importance to the Democratic and
Populist parties.
In spite of its importance as a political
center, having two candidates for the
Presidency â Mr. Bryan and Mr. Bentley,
tbe Prohibition-Silver nominee â as citi
zens, Lincoln is a very quiet place these
days. Mr. Bryan has been little seen by
Lincoln people since he reached here Fri
day week. He spends most of his time in
his library going over the mass of mail
matter and tbe packages of telegrams de
livered to his residence every day, and
dictating replies to his clerical assistants.
Of these he has three â one a lady â and
they have had their hands full in keeping
np with the nominee's correspondence.
So great has been the avalanche of writ
ten matter addressed to Mr. Bryan that he
is practically swamped, and many of the
letters and telegrams that were sent im
mediately after his nomination are not yet
answered.
Tbe Bryan and Sewall headquarters at
the Lincoln Hotel are intended principally
for the use of Mr. Bryan in receiving vis
iting delegations and conferring with
Democratic managers. Mr. Bryan has
used them two or three times only, but
with tbe National Silver and Populist con
ventions added it Is expected that be will
be obliged to go there more frequently.
The speech delivered by Mr. Bryan In
closing the debate on the Democratic plat
form at Chicago has been printed for dis
tribution under the supervision of Mr.
Bryan, with some verbal corrections.
A meeting of the State Central Commit
tee of the free silver wing of the Demo
cratic party of Nebraska will be held at
the Lincoln Hotel in this city on July 30.
Mr. Bryan has promised to be present.
Senator Jones left Lincoln on a late
train to-night over the Missouri Pacific
for his home, Washington, Term. He
wired to Governor Stone of Missouri to
meet him at Jefferson City to-morrow.
Just before leaving, Senator Jones said he
would leave it to the common-sense of the
people to right the Domination of Watson.
No definite action, he said, would be taken
at this time with regard to the acceptance
or declination of the Populist nomination
by Mr. Bryan. Senator Jones added that
he thought tbe notification meeting in
New York would take place August 10.
TEXAS POPULISTS ARE BITTER.
Prefer Fusion HUh Republicans to
Si'vport of Brynn.
AUSTIN, Tkx., July 26. -Leading Popu
lists here bitterly denounce the action of
the St. Louis convention in nominating
Bryan. John Caulfield, a prominent local
Populist leader, said:
"It appears to me that Jones and spoils
men at St. Louis ran that convention in
the interest of Bryan, and it looks to me
as though we had been sold out. To ari
icept of the convention's action is to destroy
the Populist party. 1 propose to work to
uef eat the St. Louis spoilsmen, and I shall
vote for McKinley. The Populist Conven
tion meets in Gaiveston tbe sth oi next
month, and I shall work there to bring

"There was a young lady from Niger
Who rode, with a smile, on a tiger.
They returned from the ride with the lady inside
And the smile on the face of the tiger."
about a fusion in Texas with the Repub
licans."
Gould Martin, another prominent Popu
list, who has often been represented on
their tiefcets, concurs with Caulfield, and
they claim they represent a large majority
of the Populists in the State.
BRYAN A PLAGIARIST.
Made Use of a Portion of Congressman
McCaul's Speech.
WASHINGTON, D. OL, July 26.âCon
gressman McCaul, backed by the Congres
sional Record, makes a very substantial
claim to being the oricinator of the phrase
which nominated Bryan at Chicago. Mr.
McCaul claims and proves by reference to
bis speech, as it was printed, that on Jan
uary 26, 1894, or eleven months before
Bryan first made use of the sentiment, in
discussing the Wilson bill he introduced
the reference to placing a crown of thorns
upon the head of a laboring man. The
exact wording of the speech was as fol
lows:
Ready as you have ever been to betray it
with a kiss, you scourge to the very quick, and
press a crown of thorns upon its brow.
Mr. McCaul said that he did not Know
whether Mr. Bryan was in the bouse when
he delivered his speech, and he did not
wish to accuse him of plagiarism. "But,"
said he, "there's what I said, and you
know it was said at Chicago."
SENTIMENT IN LONDON.
Banker Tritton Foresee* Disaster to
America if Bryan Wins.
LONDON, Esq., July 26,-The Daily
News will to-morrow publish a report of
an interview with Mr. J. H. Tritton, a
prominent London banker, regarding the
chances for the election of the Presidential
candidates in the United States, in which
Mr. Tritton says he considers it improb
able that Bryan will be elected, but the
situation is one of the most serious char
acter. Confidence, Mr. Tritton believes,
will not be restored here until the United
States Congress shall have passed a reso
lution declaring that it is firmly deter
mined to maintain a gold standard. Cer
tainly, says Mr. Tritton. the National
finances of America need to be overhauled.
The country is suffering from a plethora
of paper money.
Cleveland Receives No Callers.
BUZZARDS BAY, Mass., July 26.â As
is his usual custom, the President remained
at home all day. There were no callers.
He did not attend the memorial exercises
of the late William E. Russell at Sand
wich to-day, as expected. It has been re
ported by several seamen that tbe yacht
Albatross, with Senator Hill on board, has
been seen cruising off tbe coast of Marion.
The Senator has not landed at that place,
however, nor has he visited President
Cleveland.
A Bishop Denounces Populism.
ASBURY PARK, N. J., July 26.-At
the National service in the Asbury Park
Auditorium this afternoon Bishop John
P. Newman created a sensation by declar
ing that Populists were no better than an
archists and were not good American citi
zens. Instantly a man io the rear of the
hall jumped up and shouted, "Bryan is a
good American!' He tried to propose
three cheers for the Democratic- Populist
candidate for President, but his voice was
drowned by the music of the choir.
Plans of the Silver ites.
BUTTE, Most., July 26. -Senator Lee
Mantle and Congressman Hartman ar
rived in Butte to-day from Bt. Louis.
Senator Mantle said be bad not yet de
cided whether or not he would take the
stump for Bryan in the East, but was
ready to do everything he was asked to do
to help along the cause of silver. Con
gressman Hartman sairt he would remain
in Montana until the Ist of September
and from that time on he would campaign
through the Central States for Bryan.
Dickinson Is Silent.
NEWPORT, R. 1., July 26.-Hon. Don
M. Dickinson left for New York to-night.
Before going he stated that he had noth
ing to say to the public In answer to the
query to state the purpose of his visit, he
replied that he was as much surprised to
read that be was to hold a conference here
as Mr. Hill was to learn it.

A feeling of gloom pervades the camp and
the native troops are wailing with grief
over the loss of the two officers.
ENTOMBED INA
CUBAN DUNGEON,
Case of Young Ona Melton
Presented to Secre
tary Olney.
HIS HEALTH GIVES WAT.
Confined in a Little Dark Cell
Reeking With Filth and
Vermin.
HORRORS WOR3? THAT 9 DEJLTH. '
Unless the Unfortunate Competitor
Captive Is Soon Released
He Wll Die.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., July 26.â A de
termined effort is being made to induce
the United States Government to secure
the release of Ona Melton, the young
American who was captured on the Com
petitor and it now confined by the Span
iards in Fort Cabanas. The people of Key
West have petitioned Secretary Olney to
act, forwarding the petition to T. T.
Stockton, general manager of tbe Times-
Union, for transmission to Washington.
With the petition Mr. Stockton includes a
letter to Mr. Olney, in which he says:
I feel deep interett in Melton, as he went to
Cuba as the correspondent of the Times-
Union. He had no intention of serving in the
army of the insurgents, but simply desired to
get within their lines to furnish reliable news
as to the situation in Cuba. I furnished tbe
young man credentials as the representative
of the Times-Union, and these credentials he
should have had on his person when arrested
by the Spaniards.
Mr. Stockton further says that he has
reliable information from Havana that
the prisoner's health is giving way, and
that unless he is released or his condition
ameliorated he cannot live.
The petition and statement to Mr. Olney
recites that it will be remembered that
Ona Melton, who went to Cuba on the ill
fated Competitor as a representative of
the Times-Union, was arrested aboard that
vessel when she was captured by a Span
ish cruiser after havine landed an expedi
tion on the north coast under command of
Colonel Monzon. The crew of the schooner
were also apprehended and taken to
Havana, where they were subsequently
tried by a drumhead court-martial and
sentenced to be shot for piracy. An ener
getic protest made by the late Consul-
General Williams, under instructions from
Washington, secured a temporary reprieve
for the prisoners and the case was referred
to Madrid for revision.
The Spanish home Government has
since ordered a new trial for the prisoners
by the civil courts, as provided by the
terms of the protocol and treaty stipula
tions, but, like all official matters on the
island of Cuba, the trial may be put off
indefinitely through red tapeism.
Meanwhile Melton, with the other pris
oners captured on the Competitor, is con
fined in tne military fortress of Cabanas,
at the entrance to Havana harbor, in a
little dark cell, reeking with filth and ver
min. As if to add to the horror of theii
situation, a drain runs through the room,
breeding pestilence and death. Twenty
other prisoners of all colors and nationali
ties, and accused of every crime in the
catalogue, are also huddled together
within the narrow confines of the cell,
and if reports received here lately are cor
rect a leper has been thrown into the dun
geon to increase the diseases of the other
prisoners,
The late Consul-General Williams, in
view of these facts and on account of the
prisoner's extreme youth and undoubted
innocence, made every effort to have Mel
ton released, and General Lee, the present
Consul-General at Havana, has also en
deavored to have bis condition improved,
but apparently every effort seems to have
been in vain.
CUBANS MAKING GAINS.
The Spanish Garrison at Ciego Montero
Join* the Insurgents.
NEW YOBK. N. V.. July 27.â A special
cable to the World from Havana says: A
cry of alarm has been raised by ti:e Her
aldo of Madrid over the discovery of
alleged defective plates in the new iron
clad Carlos V. The announcement is cre
ating a big sensation throughout Spain.
The Havana papers, quoting tbe Her
aldo's Cadiz special dispatch, say that
though launched eighteen months ago,
the vessel, as yet, is not ready to receive
her guns, the woric being done at a snail's
pace and shoddy material being used. A
recent inspection shows that a majority of
the plates are already ruined, and it will
be necessary for the contractors to replace
them before the Government will accept
the vessel.
Re-enforcements are being hurried to
Manzanillo by sea to strengthen the
Spanish garrison. The town is reported
as besieged by the insurgents, led by
Masso, Rabi and Rios.
It is reported this morning that still
another Cuban expedition has finally dis
embarked in Pinar del Rio. It is under
stood that 125 men landed under Miros'
leadership with two cannon and an ample
supply of arms, munitions and dynamite.
The fort at Ciego Montero, near Dirigo,
Santa Clara province, surrendered to the
rebel chief iulet on the lltti withou: fir
ing a shot in defense. The Spanish garri
son joined the insurgent ranks, delivering
to the rebel leader sixteen Manser rifles
and 8000 rounds of ammunition. In Puerto
Frincipe and Pinar del Rio many deser
tions from the Spanish columns are re
ported, the officers in some instance going
over. Every effort, however, is officially
made to suppress names.
RACE RIOT IN FLORIDA,
Whites Intrude at a Colored
Festival With Dire
Results.
Six Men Killed and Eight Wounded.
Two of the Latter Are
Women.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., July 26.-Dis
patches to the Times-Union from Jasper,
Hamilton County, Fla., state that a race
riot occurred last night fifteen miles
northeast of here, in which six men were
killed and eight, wounded. Two of the
latter were women.
Those killed are said to be Henry Jack
son, Albert Sullivan and Edward Johnson
(white), Jim Solomon, Amos Campbell
and Ike Mitchell (colored). Tbe names of
the wounded have not been learned.
The traeedy occurred at Haggard's tur
pentine still, where many negroes are em
ployed. The negroes gave a "festival"
last night, and while it was in progress a
number of white men intruded and the
shooting resulted.
It is rumored that the negroes are gen
erally arming and a posse of whites left
Jasper to-nicht for tbe scene of the trag
edy.
FLORIDA HOMICIDE.
A Doctor Shot by a Neighbor Whose Life
He Mad Threatened.
GAINESVILLE, Fla., July 26.â Dr. J. D.
Cromwell was shot and fatally woun<ied
to-day Dy Towney Kenard. The trouble
started yesterday, when a niece of Crom
well, who Jived with him, ran over toKen
ard's, who lives next door, and asked him
to protect her, stating that the doctor had
struck her, and she oelieved would kill her.
This morning Cromwell demanded that
she return home. Kenard had him placed
underarrest. He pave bonds and returned
home, stating, it is said, that he intended
to kill Kenard. He secured a gun, and
was standing on his back steps when tbe
shooting commenced. Kenard fired both
barrels of a shotgun loaded with buckshot,
and six bullets entered Cromwell's body.
Kenard is under arrest. Dr. Cromwell is
about 60 years of age, crippled by rheuma
tism. Kenard is about 26 years old.
McLUCKIE SCORES CAR NEGIE.
The Eec- Burgess of Homestead. Wants the
Manufacturer Indiettd.
HAVERHILL, Mass., July 26.- John
McLuckie, ex- Burgess of Homestead, Pa.,
spoke before tbe Central Labor Union
here this afternoon, his effort being to
agitate the bringing of an indictment
against the Carnegie Company of Home
stead for furnishing the United States
Government with defective armor plate
for warships. He was very bitter in his
utterances. He said that lie was not doing
his work for the love of the country, but
for revenge. He said that in 1892 the men
at Homestead had 300 Winchester rifles;
now they have 3800, and they are ready to
use them if occasion requires.
In the late war the North compelled the
receding States to return to the Union by
force of arms, and in a Mice manner the
labor unions ought to compel workmen
out of the union to come in by shot and
shel!, shooting them down in case they
did not come in, so that the capita'ists
could not use them. The Government in
vestigation of the armor frauds was hung
I np in the Senate through the efforts of Sen
ator Quay, Carnegie's tool.
The speaker was frequently applauded,
but the union did not vote to indorse his
I sentiments.
TWENTY-EIGHT VICTIMS.
Result of the Awful Cloudburst in
Colorado Last Friday
Night.
Twenty-One Bodies Have Been Recov
ered, and the Others Have
Floated Away.
DENVER, Colo., July 26.â The victims
of Friday night's flood were the three in
Golden, four in Mount Vernon Canyon
and twenty-one near Morrison, making a
total of twenty-eight.
The servant-girl, Anna Hansen, who
was reported dead, was not at the camp at
the time of tbe flood, and consequently es
caped. A charcoal-burner named Nichols
up at Evergreen is reported missing, mak
ing the total list still twenty-eight. Of
these sixteen bodies were recovered yes
terday, and the body of Mabel Herres, a
little child, was found to-day.
P. Johnson of Arvada telephoned Into
Denver this afternoon that he had found
four bodies in the bed of Clear Creek,
a.bout a mile above tbe town of Arvacb.
The coroner at Golden was notified, and
will take charge of the bodies.
Up to the discovery of these four bodies
no report of any missing persons has
come from Golden. Arvada is a country
hamlet between Golden and Denver along
Clear Creek Valley. These bodies there
fore either floated down from Golden or
are those of campers in Clear Creek Valley
between the two points, and are not to be
confounded with missing dead over the
ridee in Bear Creek Valley, where Morri
son is located.
FINDERBILT IMPROVING.
The Millionaire Invalid Goes for a
Cruise on the Conqueror.
NEWPORT, R. 1., July 26.â Last night
Cornelius Vanderbilt was removed from
his residence on Fifth avenue, New York,
and taken on board his brother's (F. W.
Vanderbilt's) steam 3'acht Conqueror. An
easy trip was made up along the sound
and the yacht arrived here at 5 o'clock to
day. She made for the Fall River Line
dock, a most unusual place to tie up, and
the sick man was brought ashore and
placed in a New York ambulance in wait
ing. An easy drive was made to "The
Breakers." He was accompanied by his
wife, doctors and nurses. Gertrude, his
daughter, and his sons arrived last
evening.
So far as can be learned, Mr. Vanderbiit
stood the fatigue of the journey as well as
could be expected. It is hoped the sea
air will make his recovery more speedy.

Campaign.
SHERMAN GIVES ADVICE
Urges That Speakers Begin the
Work of Education at
Once.
SHOUT TALKS ON FINANCE.
Dreary Ante-Election Literature Will
Not Bi Extensively
Circulated.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 28.â Major
McKinley and Mark Hanna, chairman of
the Republican National Committee, have
been in conference most of the day and
evening at Mr. Hanna's beautiful suburban
home on the lakeside. Maior McKinley
reached Cleveland last evening and was at
once driven to Mr. Hanna'a home. Al
though Mr. McKinley has been in Cleve
land most of the week and has been the
guest all of that time at Mr. Hanna's
house the candidate and his manager have
had no opportunity to discuss the forth
coming campaign. Major McKinley said
to-day:
"I came back to Cleveland because my
many engagements during the centennial
exercises made it impossible for me to
have a full and satisfactory talk with Mr.
Hanna about the campaign and its man
agement. Indeed, we have had but one
extended talk since my nomination, and I
now find that there are scores of matters
which demand, attention and discussion
with Mr. Hanna."
The campaign has been outlined in a
general way by Mr. Hanna and his com
mittee. They do no^ know what turn
affairs may take in reference to another
Democratic ticket, and of necessity their
actions are somewhat limited in scope
and significance by the imperfectly devel
oped situation which confronts them.
Under the circumstances the most that
can be done is to have campaign literature
of an informing character quickly pre
pared and widely circulated.
Seaator Sherman, who was here two or
three .Jays last week to participate iv the
centennial exercises, is somewhat alarmed
at the manifestation of the silver senti
ment in certain sections and communities.
He told Major McKinley that his volu
minous correspondence was laden with
inquiries about the money question and
that he was of the opinion that the most
active measures to combat the silver senti
ment ought to be taken at once. He urges
both Mr. Hanna and Major McKinley to
have the speaking campaign begin at
once, and said he was ready and willing to
taKe the stump at a moment's notice.
Other Republicans of prominence, such as
Senator Hawley and ex-Governor Mer
riam of Minnesota, have expressed them
selves in pretty much the same manner to
both Major McKinley and Mr. Hanna.
Major McKinley and his manager have
reached the conclusion that the best re
sults this year will be attained by Holding
a large, indeed, an uncomonly large num
ber of political meetings. It is believed
that it will be difficult to get people to
read heavy congressional speeches on the
money question or other long documents.
On the other hand, there is abundant
evidence of a lively demand for clear,
crisp, simple talks on the money question,
and for short articles and leaflets bearing
upon it. In short, this year the commit
tees of both parties will undoubtedly spend
their money to keep hundreds of speakers
at work in the field, instead of sending
out millions oi dreary documents as baa
frequently been done. Major McKinley
and Mr. Hanna are of one mind upon this
point, and the necessary orders to the
clerk in charge of this work will be given
out at once.
When Major McKinley settles down in
Canton again this week he will begin to
think seriously about his letter of accept
ance. He expects to begin work on it
within ten days, and may have a draft of
it completed within a fortnight. It is not
his intention to make it public for a month,
or so, however. He wants to see what
turn events will take, and needs some
thing to determine the ultimate cast
which he shall give to the issues of the
campaign. The letter of acceptance will
be a sort of final, supplementary, up-to
date platform, and tbe great work of tha
campaign will be done on the lines wnich
it indicates. Major McKinley will pre
pare this document with great care, and it
will De one of the most important utter
ances of the campaign.
LEAVE FOR THE COAST.
California and Nevada Delegates Depart
from St. Lotus.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., July 26.â The great
crowds of delegates and visitors to the
Populist and Silver conventions have
melted away and St. Louis is to-night as
quiet as a graveyard. The California and
Nevada delegates, with a few exceptions,
left for home to-night. The silver men
from the Golden State carried away the
laurels of their gathering. They dom
inated the convention.
Charles D. Lane of California, chairman
of the National Committee of the Silver
party, will leave for home to-morrow
evening. He made a splendid impression
among the silver people here, especially
those coming from the extreme East. His
generosity was boundless. He contributed
largely to the expenses of the convention,
and considering the fact that he is a gold
producer the stand he has taken in this
campaign is quite unique. He will visit
Mr. Bryan on bis way home.
George P. Keeney, the young Califor
nian with classic face and flowing locks,
whose energy and ability have been rec
ognized by the leaders of the Silver party,
will leave for New York to-morrow. He
has been officially designated as the rep
resentative of the Silver party on the2
Democratic National Campaign Commit
tee. At New York he will confer with
William P. St. John regarding arrange
ments for the big Bryan-Sewall notifica
tion meeting in Madison-square Garden.
He will be in charge of the National Silver
headquarters. A. H. Pile of San Francisco
will be his assistant in charge of the office.
It was he who captured the young Democ
racy in New York, and his work here dur
ing the past week has been no less striking
or effective.
R. E. Ditendorfer, the permanent secre
tary of the National Convention, is a
Philadelphian. He was one of the execu
tive committee of the old party organiza
tion and is now chairman of the Pennsyl
vania State organization.
Hugo Hornlein left to-night for Mil
waukee and after paying a short visit to
his parents wili return to San Francisco.
All of the Californians seem very much
pleased with the result of their work.

MR. CLEVELAND'S ATTITUDE.
The President Said to Bare . Decided to
little a Statement.
' WASHINGTON, D. C., July 26.â A gen
tleman prominent in Democratic circles
who has withiq a few days conferred with
President Cleveland at his summer home
at Gray Gables, Mass., is authority for the
statement that the President has decided
to write a statement bearing on the politi-
c al situation which will cause a furor.
While he declined for obvious reasons
to be quoted, he said that Mr. Cleveland
had freely expressed displeasure at the
Chicago platform and the nominating
work of the convention and had assured
him that he would within g. few
days write a letter in which he wo nld re
pudiate the nomination because of the
free-silver platform. The President fur
ther expressed himself, according to the
gentleman, as looking with favor upon the
proposed sound-money convention.
SEQUEL TO A FIST FIGHT.
Two Young Kentuckians Settle
a Drawn Battle With
Revolvers.
One Is Instantly Killed, the Other
Wounded and FleeiDg From
the Officers.
WILLIAMSTOWX, Ky., July 25â Out
on a country road, in the Fork Lick
Hills, five miles south of this place, was
enacted a tragedy about 11 o'clock last
night that resulted in the death of one of
the participants and the wounding of the
other. Carl Hightower and Noah Reade
nower, the sons of well-to-do farmers,
v.hose faims join, had a fist-fight a few
days ago at the wedding of a neighbor's
daughter. Readenower has since threat
ened to kill Miditower. Last night they
met at Mount Pleasant Church.
Hiqhtower was riding home, accom
panied by a friend,-when he was overtaken
by Readenower, who stopped him,
and, after a few words were passed, struck
him in the face with a stone, which he
took from his pocket. Hightower drew a
revolver and fired two shots at Reade
nower, each shot making a slight wound,
and then wheeled his horse and started to
run. As he started, Readenower, who had
got his pun from his pocket, fired at him,
the ball striking him in the back and kill
ing him almost instantly.
Readenower took to the hills and is still
at laree. The Sheriff with a posse of men
are in pursuit. If he is found a lynching
will likely occur.
TORNADO IN MICHIGAN.
Appalling Destruction of Life and Prop
erty Reportedâ Wires Prostrated
and News Meager.
DETROIT, Mich., July 26.â At a late
hour to-night meager reports were received
here of a diastrous tornado, which sve-pt
throu.:h the southern part of the State
rarly this evening.
The most alarming reports come from
Homer, Calhoun County, from the vicin
ity oi which it is said great damage was
done to farming property, with probably
serious loss of life. Farm houses are re
ported overturned and wrecked, barns
thrown down and all crops laid low.
The wind and rain following the storm
were bo severe that it has interfered with
with both telegrapn and telephone ser
vice, and it is practically impossible to se
cure more definite returns before morning.
The storm in this vicinity waa very se
vere. Fully two inches of ram fell inside
of two Hours, doing considerable damage
by flooding the basements of business
bouses.
The electrical display accompanying the
rai n lasted from 7 o'clock to midnight,
and made the heavens as light as day.
Every streetcar road in the city suffered.
Drowned in the Ohio.
BELLAIRJE, Ohio, July 28.â While re

wheel of the United States snagboat E. A.
Woodruff, which is moored near the
moutn of McMeechan Creek, and were
sucked in by the swift current, capsizing
their boat and drowning Mrs. Long and
her daughter. The water at this point is
about 30 feet deep, and nothing was done
to recover the bodies to-night Mrs. Long
leaves a husband, two sons and one
daughter. The captain and crew of the
Woodruff did all in thoir power to rescue
them, but were helpless.

BRYANIZING Of
TIE POPULISTS,
The Chaotic Conditions That
Led to the Nebraskan's
Nomination.
WEAVER'S CLOSE CALL.
Elected Chairman of the Plat
form Committee by Only
One Vote.
RESULTS THAT BEEM STRANGE.
Two R?asons Why the Middle-of-the-
Roadsters F i cd to Control tbe
Convention
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 26.â 1 resume my
review of the conditions which made the
inevitable and gave color to the proceed
ings, and I shall close with a succinct
statement of the actual political situation.
I premise that my twenty hours of close
contact and hand-to-band encounters
with forty-rive of the best men in the
Populist party who constituted the com
mittee on platform and resolutions â men
who are thoroughly schooled in the eco
nomics and philosophy of the Populist
system, and coming to the work in hand
thoroughly equipped by intellectual train
ins and made practical by political and
official experienceâ gave me a complete
mastery oi the purposes and methods
both of the straight Populists and our
Bryan ized associates.
It is also important that I state a tact
with regard to tbe choice of chairman of
the committee, for it is generally known
that General Weaver was elected by but
one majority, and two belated members
arrived just as tbe vote was declared who
would have voted for Judge Jerome C.
Kerby of Texas, Populist candidate for
Governor of that State, and he would have
been chosen by one vote instead of Gen
eral Weaver, who said to me in a tone of
defiance just before the vote was taken :
"I shall be elected by a two-thirds vote,
for I represent two-thirds of tbe conven
tion."
That wai no doubt the belief of all
Bryamzed Populists. â¢ Probably General
Weaver never went through a more excit
ing event in his life than while the vote
was counted. His face was purple with
excitement. But from the moment the
vofe was announced the word was passed
rapidly to all the leading Bryan Populists
not on our committee, and they at once
moderated their attitude toward the
straisrht Populists. When the convention
reversed the order and decided to elect the
Vice-Presidential candidate first, and then
proceeded in spite of all obstacles raised
by tbe Bryanites to elect Tom Watson, the
actual strength of the straight Populist?
asserted itself.
In the face of these results it may seem
strange to some people that tha straight
Populists did m t thereafter rule the con
vention and even go so far as to nominate
Colonel Norton or some other man as they
did Watson, but a look at the facts be
neath this space will make this seeming
inconsistency perfectly clear. There are
two reasons: First, the straight Populists
never intended to refuse alliance with the
other reform forces which stood for free
silver and more money, and they were
agreed that Bryan stood for perhaps a full
third of these forces, and was in fact at
heart at Populist; second, they recognized
the fact that the country was in the first
stage of a great Bryan fever, and half the
people of the whole country were gone
daft in favor of Bryan, and that it would
be necessary to keep the convention here
perhaps ten days, in order to change pub
lic sentiment and make it safe to ignore
the claim and pretensions of the Bryan
ites.
It was known to all that the poverty of the
delegates would force two-thirds of them
to return on Saturday; hence, a nomina
tion became necessary and Bryan had to
be tbe man. It may help to make the
proceedings of this most extraordinary
convention a little more comprehensible
if I call attention to the fact that four
States were organized and consolidated
with the ablest leadership to force the issue
of nominating Bryan on the vast unorgan
ized majority, who had no plans laid, no
candidates agreed upon, no concert of
action of any kind, except to secure a
genuine and unimpaired declaration of tbe
party's faith in the platform. Those four
States were lowa, Nebraska, Kansas and
Colorado.
Weaver in lowa, Allen in Nebraska,
Llewellyn m Kansas and Tom Patterson
in Colorado led the fight in their several
States. They soon succeeded in dividing
the delegations in several of the States
west of Ohio. It was a comparatively
easy matter for these four States, with
tbeir large delegations under the inspira
tion and direction of the State leaders, to
invade the defenseless delegations of all
the other States and win over a part
of them, and thus create dissensions and
distrust, with all the attendant weakness
and distraction of a divided delegation.
I must abruptly close. Tbe heat has
been so prostrating that writing was out
of the question till late in the afternoon,
and it is now half-past 6, with the ther
mometer at 98 deg. and no preparation
yet made for our journey, and we are to
start in two hours. We are all well except
Dore of Fresno, who is worn out and half
sick to-day with work on the National ex
ecutive committee; but he will be able to
go. I will resume the analysis of the situ
ation to-morrow.

MRS. BALLING TON BOOTH.
An Enormous Crowd Gathers at Psekskill,
N. V. f to Listen to the Popular
Volunteer Commander.
STATE CAMP, PEEKSKILL, N. V.,
July 26.â One of the largest crowds that
ever gathered to hear religious services in
camp since the days of Beecher and Tal
mage was the one that surrounded Mra,
BalUtigton Booth in the Y. M. C. A. tennis
court this afternoon. At 3:30 o'clock the
commander of the Volunteers, escorted by
the commander of the post, General Me-
Alpin, marched through the crowd, fol
lowed by all the State officers in fatigue
uniform and with swords.
In introducing Mrs. Booth General Mc-
Alpin spoke briefly of the circumstances
that led up to tne secession from the
parent organization and the formation of
the Volunteers. He also spoke very
highly of the work Mrs. Booth has done
and is aoing.
Mrs. Booth stood upon a chair, that her
voice might the bettor be heard by the
audience. She said she came to speak to
the soldiers, but she was very glad to see
so many other people present. Then fol
lowed one of her bright talks, full of
simple lessons. A crowd of soldiers fol
lowed her to the stage when she had fin
ished, and as it moved away their hats
were waved to her until the stage rounded
the bluff and was lost to sight.

RAIN SPOILS A MEETING,
Forty Thousand Socialists Get a
Drenching at Hyde Park,
London.
No Speeches Are Made, but an Anti-
Landlord Resolution Is Put
Through.
LONDON, End., July 26.â A deluge of
rain which began early this afternoon and
continued throughout the remainder of
the day had the effect of spoiling the in
ternational peace -demonstration in Hyde
Park . organized by the . International So
cialist Congress, which will begin its sit
tings to-morrow. ' .. ~ ' â¢
A number of trade societies and many
Socialists assembled upon ' the Thames
embankment at noon and marched to
Hyde Park. It is estimated that 40,000
persons were in line when the procession
started, and this number was augmented
steadily after Hyde Park was reached
until the rain began to fall.
Eventually the ' heavy downpour com
pelled the assembled crowd to break up
into groups, which took refuge under
trees. Before dispersing, however, a reso
lution was proposed and adopted declar
ing that the only way. to secure inter
national peace was through the abolition
of the capitalist- landlord system in which
wars have root. , ,
Among the speakers whom it was in
tended should address the meeting were
MM. Jaures, Miller and Guesde, mem
bers of the French Chamber of Deputies,
and Herren Liebknecht and Bebel of the
German Reichstag. The list of speakers
included no members of the House of
Commons, but Tom Mann, the labor
leader, and a number ot other socialists
were, according to the .programme, to ad
dress the meeting.

L<aurier delivered an important speech at
St. Johns, Quebec, yesterday. In the
course of his remarks be said nothing
would be done at the next session of Parlia
ment except to pass supply bills, and that
tbe consideration of the tariff would be
deferred until the regular session in Jan

greatest caution, so as not to interfere with
tbe business interests of the country. The
Government, he said, would settle the
Manitoba school qnestion within six

development of the Northwest and to
strengthening the commercial relations
between England and Canada and between
Canada and the United States.

Unspeakable Crimes Allowed to Go

BERLIN, Germany, July 26.â Count
Goluchowski, Austrian Minister of Foreign
Affairs, returned to Ischl for the purpose
of holdin â  an interview with Emperor
Francis Joseph, after having had a con
ference with Prince Hohenlohe, the Ger
man Chancellor, at the latter's chateau at
Alt-Ausse, and reached Vienna on Thurs
day. On the day of his return to Vienna
Count Goluchowski had an interview with 1
Count Nigri, the Italian embassador to
Austria, and since then Count Nisri has
been summoned to Home by the Marquis
Visconti-Venosta, the Italian Minister of
Foreign Affairs. These comings and go
ings of diplomatic chiefs cannot be at
tributed to any other cause than the
gravity of the situation in the East. A
concert ot the powers has failed to per
fectly result, as has already been stated,
and the events which are now taxing place
completely overwhelm diplomacy.
According to the telegraphic advices re
ceived here yesterday, the rising of the
insurgents in Macedonia has become ex
ceedingly formidable. Greece, while pre
tending to take stringent measures against
any Greeks engaging in a faid on the
Macedonian frontier, has allowed upward
of 600 men, all of them armed with Ebel
rifles, to enter Macedonia from Greek ter
ritory. These men, after surprising and
cutting to pieces the Turkish troops at
Moussa, succeeded in repulsing a strong
force of Turkish soldiers which had been
sent from Saionica to re-enforce the Moussa
troops.
A dispatch to the Vossiche Zeitung says
that the Redifs (reserves), who have been
called out under an irade from tbe Sultan,
are showing a disposition to revolt in con
sequence of the fact that thoir pay is very
much in arrears and the rations which
are being issued to them are very bad in
quality and very small in quantity.
A special dispatch received by the Neve
Freie Presse from Salonicaon Thursday
says that statements made by the Turkish
officials concerning the situation are all
calculated to conceal the desperate condi
tion of affairs in Macedonia. Hard fight
ing is going on nearly every day at Drum
nits Seres and at nearly all points in the
mountains. The Turkish reserves at Priz
rend Preshtima and elsewhere in that sec
tion are being equipped and sent to the
front as rapidly as possible, and it is es
timated that the total number of Turkish
troops concentrated on the Macedonian
and Bulgarian frontiers exceeds 7000 men.
Even this force, however, has not been
found sufficient to make any headway
against the insurrection, which, under the
influence of successes already achieved by
the insurgents in the field is becoming
stronger every day. t
Stimulated by these and similar reports,
semi-official newspaper organs lite the
North German Gazette and the Cologne
Gazette, are taking a more definite tone in
their articles commenting upon the grav
ity of the situation.
The North German Gazette reproduces
an article from the Cologne Gazette which
declares that unless the powers interfere
in an energetic way, instead of submitting
proposals to the Porte, the troubles in
Crete and Macedonia wiil never end.
The Reichsbote (Conservative') publishes
a letter written by a German lady living at
Monatstir wherein tbe writer narrates
atrocities which are practiced there every
day withont the slightest attempt at inter
ference on the part of the authorities.
Among the horrors of which the lady
treats in her communication, she details
the fact of Turks assaulting Macedonian
women and girls publicly in the streets,
before the eyes of their husbands and pa
rents. This letter has stirred op a strong
feeling of public indignation here, more in
fact than the remoter massacres and out
rages in Armenia.
The Reichsbote, in an article accompany
ing the letter, appeals to the powers to
cease their jealousies, and interfere in be
half of the Macedonians and Cretans in
tbe interests of humanity.
The Bismarckian organs, on the other
hand, are strongly opposed to any policy
of interference on the part bf Germany.
The Neuste Nachrichten declares that
the powers must maintain Turkish
rule in Crete and Macedonia, which the
insurgents are trying to shake off. If
they continue their efforts to throw off
the Turkish yoke, the paper adds, they
must suffer the consequences. Europe
cannot stake tbe peace of the world on
their account.
After the meeting of the Emperor with
King Oscar of Sweden-Norway on Thurs
day the imperial yacht Hobenzollern,
with the Kaiser on board, steamed up to
Maerk, at the head of Geiranger Fjord,
which is about the end of the Emperor's
northern tour.
Advices from Molde Fjord say that the
Emperor had a week of better weather
than that which he experienced at the
beginning of his trip. The entertainments
on board the Hohenzollern have been ex
cellent throughout the weak. A choir of
sailors, comprising 100 men whose voices
were tinely trained, were heard to ad van
tage at the Sunday servicea, and their
chorals were accompanied by the ship's
band. Upon these occasions the Emperor
reÂ»d a short discourse and two prayers.
Berlin has hardly ever before witnessed
such a scarcity of notable persons in the
city. Dr. Miqael, Minister of Finance;
Baron yon Hamraerstein-Loxten, Minister
of Agriculture, Domains and Forests, and
Herr Nieberding, Imperial Minister of
Justice, left the city for their holidays on
Thursday. Count Posadowaky-Wehner,
Minister of the Imperial Treasury,
started for the Tyrol on Thursday, and
Dr. Bosse, Minister of Ecclesiastical Af
fairs, Instruction and Medicinal Affairs,
has gone to Carlsbad. The Foreign Em
bassadors and Ministers are also gener
ally taking tbeir holiday.
The Wugnerian festival at Bayreuth has
attracted many cf the most distinguished
Germans and foreigner;. Among those
who are sojourning at Bayreuth are the
Prince and Frincess of Saxe-Meininsren,
Prince yon Honenlohe-Langenburg, Duke
and Duchess Albrecht of Mecklenburg-
Schwerin, Princess Vera of Wurtemburg,
Prince and Princess yon Leiningen, Count
yon Wedel-Piesdorf and Dr. Schweninger,
Prince Bismarck's physician.
Among the crowds of Americans at Bay
reutb are J. B. Jackson, first secretary of
the United States Embassy, and Mrs.
Jackson, the Misses Butler, Louise Dana
and Natalie Curtis of New York,
Mesdames H. R. Chamberlain, Patterson
T. Williams aud ixÂ»wry of New York,

The dates of the Czar's proposed visits
to the principal Continental capitals, if in
deed they have been fixed, are being kept
very dark. Recent announcements have
been made that his trip is becoming more
uncertain daily, and nihilism seems to be
the specter wnich is standing in his Majes
ty's way. All that is now known of his
intentions is ti.at it is his purpose to visit
Vienna and Berlin and probably Paris,
but when the visits will take place it is
impossible to say.
The Emperor's visit to Ninjhi- Novgorod,
which he made on Saturday, was accom
panied by the usual precautions, so far
as railway travel was concerned. The rail
ways over which he traveled were guarded
by troops throughout, but when his
Majesty was within the limits of the city
of Niujlii-Novgorod, the usual lines of
police guarding the streets through which
he passed were dispensed with. The Mayor
of the city issued a manifesto to the people
urging tnera to maintain order themselves
and to keep the streets clear of crowds.
The Mayor's confidence that the citizens
would preserve order was not misplaced,
as there was no trouble whatever.
The case of M. Herbette, formerly French
Embassador to Germany, who was recently
recalled from Berlin by his Government
on account the imperial social disfavor
here, is paralleled by the case of M. Loze,
French Embassador to Austria. M. Loze
owed nis appointment to the post in
Vienna to his knowledge of secrets which
seriously affected members of the French
Ministry, which information he acquired
while holding the office of Prefect of Police.
These secrets relate to the Reinach scan
dals in the Panama canal case, which the
Ministry suppressed by the appointment
of M. Loze to lepresent France at the
Austrian court. His career as an attor
ney's clerk and a police official, which be
came known in Vienna, injured his
chances of being accepted in society at the
very outset, and his defective manners ex
posed him to no end of ridicule. Mme.
Loze, his wife, was greatly more refined
than he and made a social success, but
Austrian aristocracy, which is extremely
exclusive, would not tolerate M. Loze.
He made a complete failure as a diplomat
and has now been recalled.
The German authorities have arrested
Herr Schweder, tne agent of the German
East Africa Company on the Pangani
River, upon charges of extreme cruelty to
natives, especially toward the women,
many of whom he is accused of having
assaulted. Herr Schweder has been trans
ported in chains to Tanga, Herr Eugene
Wolffe, the African explorer, has written
to the Tageblatt, in which be speaks very
highly of Schweder, who, he says, was
liked by everybody, including Baron
Wissmann, the German Governor.
An agent of the Venezuelan Government
is here endeavoring to negotiate with the
Disoonto-Gesellschaft a loan of $50,000,000.
Up to the present time he has not been
successful.
Dr. Luetgenan, the Socialist Deputy in
the Reichstaz, in a speech delivered to the
Socialists of Essen yesterday, declared
that the Socialises had no definite pro
gramme, their primary object being to
destroy tbe existing society and govern
ment. When the downfall of these insti
tutions had been achieved then the Social
ists would formulate a platform upon
which they would build.
The Vorwaerts declared that the dele
gates comprising the coming international
Socialist congress in London will stead
fastly refuse to admit anarchists into the
congress. The Neuste Nachrichten de
clares that this declaration of the Vor
waerts is mere hypocrisy. The Socialists
and anarchists, the Nachrichten declares,
are brothers, only the latter are the more
impatient about attaining their aims. If
the barriers of society should ever be
thrown down, the Nachrichten adds, the
anarchists would reap what the Socialists
have sown.
The Emperor has accepted the Invita
tion of Prince Luitpold, Prince Regent of
Bavaria, to review the Bavarian army
corps at Wurzburg on September 18. This
is regarded as a counter-blast against the
particularist agitation in Bavaria and other
South German States.

STOCKTON BOYS SCALDED.
Children Overturn a Boiler Willed With
Boiling Water.
STOCKTON, Cal.. July 26.â Two sons
of W. S. Reynor, who lives on East South
street, in this city, came near being scalded
to death last night. The boys are aged 9
and 14 years. The younger may die from
the effects of the terrible burns received.
Mrs. Reynor had placed a boiler full of
water over a gasoline stove, and the water
had healed to the boiling point, when the
boys, who were playing in the room,
knocked the stove over. Tbe scalding
water fell directly on the children, and
their screams brought Reynor and his wife
to the rescue. The younger child was the
more seriously burned, and Dr. Lanthurn
was at once summoned to attend to his
injuries. He found tbe younger very badly
burned about the abdomen and thighs,
and tbe other scalded on the left arm and
shoulder. To-day the children were rest
ing easily, but there is still danger that
ti e little fellow will die.

the request was granted. Unless a new
trial is secured the case will be taken to
the Supreme Court.

was drowned to-day in the surf at Long

of the party had a rope thrown to him
and was tov.-ed to sbore. N. G. Hughes

ous undertow which came so near engulf
ing the whole party that no assistance
could be given to Gee. A sad feature of

daughters witnessed his struggles with the
waves and heard bis piteous outcry for
help. Tbe body had not been recovered at
a late hour to-night.
San Joaquin Grain in Demand.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 26.â Grain is
not coming in to the warehouses here as
fast as it did at this season last year.
There are several reasons for this, and
some of these reasons the warehousemen
of Stockton do not fancy. Three firms are
fighting for the warehouse business along
the lines of the Valley road ana the
Southern Pacific Company. This is work
ing against the Stockton warehouses tem
porarily, but the damage to the local grain
handiera can only be temporary, as the
"freeze out" game that the three concerns
are now playing cannot last very long.
While it does last, the farmers of the
Valley are gainers.
The Carmelito Pipe Line.
PACIFIC GROVE. Cal., July 26.â Work

ready expended over $80,000 in trying to
develop a coal mine situated there.

Grand Keeper of Records
and Seal McConnell
a Defaulter.
FLEES FROM PORTLAND.
Squandered Thousands of Dol
lars of Lodge Funds in
Riotous Living.
LIQUOR CAUSED HIS DOWNFALL
Once Confessed to a Shortage but
Was Forgiven by His
Brethren.
PORTLAND, Ob., July 26.â Being a
jolly good fellow and an extravagant man
about town have involuntarily exiled
from this city and from his family and
friends George McConnell, grand keeper
of records and seals of the Knights of
Pythias. In short, McConnell robbed the
order of between $"000 and $3000. Experts
are now going over his accounts and when
they make their final report it is possible
that this defalcation may be considerably
swelled.
The first intimation of McConnell's pec
ulations came to light last October, during
tbe meeting of tne Grand Lodge. At a
morning session an announcement was
made that the reports of tbe grand officers
would be received in the afternoon. Dur
ing the recess hours on that day McCon
nell confessed to ten of his most intimate
friends of the Grand Lodge that he had
embezzled about $800 of the Grand Lodge
funds. With tears streaming down his
cheeks he stated that drink was the cause
of his offense. He promised, if granted
immunity from criminal prosecution and
Kiven another chance, that he would for
swear liqnox and make restitution.
The Knights wliom McConnell took into
his confidence not only refrained from ex
posing the culprit, but they gave their in
dividual notes to cover the shortage. In
order to allow McConnell to redeem him
self, these ten men were instrumental in
causing his re-election to the trust he had
betrayed; but to guard against any future
dereliction on his part, an amendment to
the laws was enacted, in effect that all
subordinate lodges from that time on re
mit their dues to the grand master of ex
â¢ chequer instead of to McConnell.
Quite a number of subordinate lodges in
this State, however, continued sending
their dues to McConneli. Sums amount
ing to $1400 he absorbed in riotous living.
Since then the experts have discovered an
additional $400 stolen by McConnell in
1895. He left nere a few days ago, pre
sumably going to his old home in Canada.
Steps will be taken toward having him ex
tradited.
AN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL.
Archbishop Gross' - Authority â  Defied in
. ' . His Oirti Archdiocese.
PORTLAND, Or., July 26. -Archbishop
Gross' authority is being defied in his own
archdiocese. He is having more trouble
with his parishioners a>. Cedar Mills, Wash- '
ington County, and though it is serious
from the view point of the church, it ,is
not likely to worry the archbishop very
much. The trouble arises from the build
ing of an independent Catholic school at
Cedar Mills by the sisters of mercy. They
v, re on the side of Father Kelly in his
quarrel with the archbishop and Sister
Viiiiam a year aeo. When the arch
bishop refused to let them teach in the
diocese, they went to Cedar Mills, and
Father Kelly sheltered them. . When they
refused to obey the orders of the arch
bishop be excommunicated them. Noth
ing daunted, they solicited funds to build
a â¢ chool.
This school is about completed and will
be opened late next month or early in
September. The archbishop refuses to
recognize the school as a Catholic institu
tion and will deny the rights of the church
to parents sending their children to the
school. While they' were at Cedar: Mills
Father Kelly published a number of arti
cles in a newspaper attacking Archbishop
Gross and Sister William, the superior
under whom the sisters of mercy had
been given their trial as teachers. -
Inspect Portland's Harbor.
PORTLAND, Ob., July 26.â The Japan
ese visitors, President Asano of tbe Orien
. tal Steamship Company and other offi
cials spent the day looking at Portland's
harbor and at Willamette Falls, Oregon
City, where they were shown the immense
eiectric light and power plant system
which is established there. The visitors
are pleased with Portland's advantages.
However, one of the directors says they
will give San Francisco and San Diego
careful investigation and that all claims
will be impartially considered with re
gard to a terminus for the steamer line.
They left to-night for San Francisco to
join the other members of the party that
is to locate the terminus for the steamship
line.
WELCOMED TO EUREKA.
Oregon Excursionists Tendered
a Reception by the
Citizens.
Given tbe Freedom of the City and a
Varied Programme of Enter
tainment.
EUREKA, Cal., July 2G.â The Oregon
excursionists in a body attended the ball
given last night in honor of their visit.
Despite the fact that the committee had
been forewarned, it was uncomfortably
near Sunday before the dancing ceased.
At the appointed time this morning, a
large number of ladies and gentlemen had
assembled in the parlors of the Vance
Hotel to welcome the visitors and tender
to them the freedom of the city. Attor
ney F. A. Cutler delivered an address of
welcome, which was responded to by
Judge Murphy. Judge J. D. H. Chamber
lain followed with a talk on the benefits
of such excursions from a business point
of view.
So greatly pleased are the voyagers with
their reception, that another party will
be made up at Orescent City for next Sat
urday, for the beneht of those left behind
because they could not secure steamship
accommodations.
The party will leave Eureka at 7 o'clock
Monday morning, when it will be escorted
by a reception committee with a band of
music to the entrance of the harbor.
After the reception to-day some remained
to see the d^ll and hose contests. Others
left with friends and acquaintances to
visit at tne homes of townspeople until
to-morrow. The public buildings were all
left open for inspection by the visitors.
In the afternoon from 2 until 4 an open
air concert was given by the Tenth Bat
talion Band. The two hours' intermission
had allowed the excursionists time to rest,
ana before the concert began the streets
were crowded. Special attractions were
arranged at the several churches for this
evening. After the services the excur
sionists made ready for an early start in
the morning.
THE SA NTA CRUZ CAMPERS.
Large Gatherings of Christians Attend
Anobath Serrices.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., July 26.â Sunday
was a great day for the Christian people at
Garfield Park. Lone before church time
wagons and buggies arrived, bringing
worshipers from among the country peo
ple. These, together with the city folk
and the campers, filled the immense au
ditorium.
The morning sermon was preached by
Rev. F. M. Jefferson of Berkeley, who
spoke on "The Reconciliation." It was
an elaborate study of comparative religion,
the incarnation of Christ, his resurrection
and atonement. The discourse was on
orthodox lines, except as to the atone
ment. The speaker's remarks on this
point were not fully indorsed, many say
ing: "We will have to study the matter a
little before accepting fully Brother Jeffer
son's ideas." All admitted that it was a
remarkable discourse, and it was highly
appreciated.
There was a large attendance at the
Bunday-school at 9:30 o'clock, led by A.
Sanders of Marysville. Many of the chil
dren from the city joined the young folks
among the campers in tbe Sunday-school.
At 3 p.m. Rev. H. Shadle, J. W. Kelsey
and R. L. McHatton led the communion
service, several hundred partaking of the
ixtrd's Supper.
The Christian Endeavor service was a
spirited one, led by Miss Ivey of Sacra
mento and attended by a large number of
Endeavorers. Following this meeting,
Rev. S. M. Martin, the evangelist, spoke
eloquently on "Tne Holy Bpirit."
POINT LOMA ADVENTURE
Coronado Summer School Girls
Explore the Oceanside
Caves.
They Are Lowered to the Water
With Ropes and Swim Into
the Caverns.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., July 26.â Four girls
and three boys in the geological class of
the Coronado summer school engaged in
a perilous venture yesterday morning be
fore daylight. They visited the caves on
the ocean side of Point Loma, making a
start at 2a. m. in order to reach the caves
at low tide. They expected to gather
marine curiosities, and carried ropes,
picks, crowbars and iron buckets. Upon
reaching the caves the tide was at the low
est mark, but. the question was how to get
the young ladies into the caves. It was
necessary to lower them with ropes. The
water being deep and the night cloudy it
was a hazardous undertaking.
"Why," said the Polhamus girls, "we
have our bathing-suite with us. We wili
put them on and be lowered dov/n. We
will taCe candles with us and swim into
the caves. We came here to go into the
caves and we will go."
The Misses Bremer and Freeze proved
to be as venturesome as the Polhamus
girls, and they were all let down by ropes
to tbe water and swam into the caves with
lighted candles on their heads. They
were accompanied by Messrs. Woodward,
Magee and Morse.
The caves were thoroughly explored and
some valuable specimens secured. Some
trouble was experienced by Misses Bremer
and Freese in getting back upon terra
firma. Two of tbe young men had to
climb tbe rope hand over hand and pull
the girls up, while tbe third youne man
did the "boosting." The Polhamus girls
are members of the Zlac Rowing Club,
and are very athletic. Tney climbed the
rope like the boys. All declared it was a
jolly experience, but they admitted they
were scared when they first struck the surf
and found it was boiling around the mouth
of the cave. The caves are proving a great
attraction to sightseers.
WOODBRIDGE DAM WASHED OUT.
Great Damage Caused by High Water
in the Mokelumne
River.
LODI, Cal., July 26.â The big wooden
dam across the MoKeiumne River at Wood
bridge was greatly damaged by a washout
at 10:30 o'clock this morning. It was
washed out for a distance of 100 feet, and
the piling and apron are partially gone.
No warning of the approaching disaster
was given. The part that is gone is that
put in last winter at much expense. No
estimate can be made of the amount of
the damage until the water is lower. The
farmers will get no water until next win
ter, as no repairs can be made until then.
It will cause great loss to alfalfa-raisers.
No further break Ls expected. The dam is
the property of the Wood bridge irrigation
and Canal Company.
SAN JOSE AFFRAY.
Two Zaborers â  Seriously Injure Each
Other in a fight. ]
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 26.â Luigi Scarre
and Roceo Lotito, laborers who occupy a
small shanty on El Dorado street, became
engaged in a row last night and when the
police arrived both men looked as though
they had been run through a thrashing
machine. The trouble started over the

A Great Enterprise That Is
Now Well Under
Way.
KERN RIVER HARNESSED
Waters of the Stream Utilized
to Turn the Wheels of
Industry.
TAKING A FORWARD STEP.
Three Hundred Thousand Dollars Ex
pended on a System of
Development
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., July 26.â For
many years it has been apparent to all
who have been cognizant of the situation
that in the larce and perpetual flow of the
Kern River (ranking as the third stream
in point of size in California), coupled
with the heavy grade of that watercourse,
lay dormant an amount of power that
must inevitably at some time be harnessed
to the wheels of industry and furnish sup-

Over a Dangerous Place Along the Cliff.
port for thousands who would find em
ployment in the wide range of industries
that might be successfully and profitably
carried on with its aid, while supplying a
good home market for the wide range of
raw materials that are now or can be suc
cessfully produced here. Although these
facts have been patent for years to all ob
servers, it has remained for the Power
Development Company, an organization
of San Francisco capitalists, to take hold
of the project in earnest.
The point selected for the initial opera
tions of this company was at the mouth
of the canyon of Kern River, about six
teeu miles northeast of the town of Bak
ersh'eld. Here that stream, after its bois
terous course of 100 miles from the slopes
of Mount Whitney through a rugged and
almost impenetrable series of precipitous
mountain canyons, takes a series of tinal
plunges over falls, forming cataracts and j
rapids, preparatory to entering on its
peaceful journey through the valley and
the green fields, orchards and vineyards
beyond, of which it is the life-giving fluid.
Near the mouth of the canyon, on tbe
northern bank of the river, a site was se
lected for a power-house, and then, in
order to obtain the necessary fall for the
water that was to be used in the generation
power, which was the object sought,
surveys were made which showed that it
would be necessary to go some 9000 feet
up the canyon before the level of the river
could be reached at a point suitable for
the diversion of a portion of its flow.
The site was so steep and rugged that in
many places it was found necessary to let
men down with ropes from overhead and

ment Company.
keep them suspended while they drilled
holes in the rock and prepared the giant
powder blasts which were to clear the
pathway for the immense flume that is to
carry the water to the power-house. A
trail or pathway, in some cases more than
twelve feet in width, had to be cut from
the rock the entire distance, upon which
to lay the timbers of the flume. When,
this task was completed the construction
of the flume was commenced. The lum
ber had to be hauled by team from tne
railroad sixteen miles away, after a sub
stantial bridge had been built across the
river, as the only available wagon-road
came to the soutb side, and deposited at
the power-house site. Then a tramway
325 feet long and with a slope of 30 per
cent was laid up the steep hill to the point
where the flume was to commence, or
rather end. A steam sawmill was set up
at tbe foot of this tramway, where tbe
lumber was all cut to the proper dimen
sions, loaded on cars and hauled by wire
up the incline to the level of the trail.
There the work of building the flume was
commenced. As the flume was built an
iron track was laid upon the cover or top
floor, over which the lumber was hauled
by horses "to the front" as fast as needed
in tbe work of construction.
The flume is 8 feet wide by 6 in depth,
and is constructed on 4x6 sills and up
rights, three feet from center. At the bot
tom an iron bolt or tierod extends across
between each upright, while the latter are
held together at the top by 2xÃ inch tim
bers, on which 2-inch plank 13 laid fora
covering. The flume itself is made of
first a course of boards 1 inch thick and 12
inches wide. On this is laid a coat of
heavy felt, and this in turn is covered with
a layer of hot asphalt. Over this again :s
a lining of balf-inch boards, thus
making the structure watertight and free
from loss by leakage. On the top of the
2-inch plank covering the railroad track is
laid for the full length.
There is not a single angle in the entire
8000 feet of flume, the changes in course
being ail made by curves and tangents,
which of course adds greatly to the stabil
ity of the structure by lessening tbe strain
incidental to the carrying of a large vol
ume of water at a good grade along a
tortuous course. The grade of the flume
is 5 8-10 feet to the mile and it has 23 per
cent of curvature.
Not less than 475,000 feet of the choicest
clear Humboldt redwood enter into the
construction of the flume. Only the roof
and top girders are of pine. So carefully
was the redwood lumber selected that the
manager says be would deem it a safe
proposition to forfeit $1000 for every knot
found, provided he be given $1 for every
board or sticK found in which there is no
knot.
An interesting feature of this structure
is an arch of sixty-foot span, upon which
the flume is carried over a particularly bad
place along the cliff. This arch was made
"by building up false work and upon it
bending ordinary Ix 6 boards. Twenty of
them were thus bent and fastened to
gether for each curve of the arch, with
the result that a most substantial and
perfect arch was made at small cost.
The flume will carry 280 cubic feet of
water per second, and at its terminus at
the mouth of the canyon, 8574:9 feet from
the point of leaving the river, it is 202 feet
above the power-bouse. There the water
will be delivered into a steel pipe 5 feet 6
inches in diameter and 540 feet long, said
to be the largest steel pipe in the State.
The fall from the end of tbe flume to the
power-house is exactly 201:9 feet, and tbe
volume of water carried will generate
about 7500 horsepower.
The wheels by which this power is to be
generated have not yet been contracted
for. They are to be of the tangential type,
and a number of companies constructing
different patterns of w'beels are preparing
to make proposals for their construction.
The power-house itself is a structure
35x70 feet clear floor space and IBleethieh.
In it will be installed at first two* 460 K. W.
(600 horsepower), 257 R- P. M. G. E. alter
nators, 7200 alternations per minute, ini
tial voltage 500, raising transformers to
increase voltage to 11,000, provision being
made all through for other generators of
the same size as they are required. The
electricity will be conducted from the
power-house on six No. 4 bare copper
wires at 7U per cent of loss in line and
1000 drop in voltage to the distributing
station in Bakersfield. a distance of four
teen miles by wire line and sixteen by
wagon road.
Here it will be transformed and reduced
to 2000 voltage and then sent out for gen
eral use. It will be utilized at first for tbe
operation of an extensive system of elec
tric railroads connecting the towns of Ba
kerstield and Kern, and possibly extend
ing into outside districts. Incandescent
and arc lights will be provided in both
towns for street and house illumination.
Power for the operation of pumps for irri
gation will be supplied, as well as for man
ufacturing of every kind. Tbe mines in
tbe mountains to tne east and accessible to
the power-house are expected to take con

hoisting works, which will be cheaper
than any other power that can be pro
cured.
There are about, forty men now at work
on the plant, the poles for the transmis
sion of the electricity to the distributing
station in town aro all up, and it is ex
pected that by November 1 tbe entire
machinery will be in operation. The con
tract for supplying the electric machinery
was let to the General Electric Com
pany of Schenectadv, N. V., while Lacey
&, Co. of Los Angeles have the steel-pipe
line contract. All the work so far has
been done by day's work, which is a guar
anty of its having been well done. Among
other things the company has erected a
handsome cottage at the power-house for
the occupancy of the man who will have
charge, while a telephone line is now in
operation connecting the power-house
with the office in town. The entire plant
will involve an outlay of over $300,000, and
it is wholly a cash outlay. No bonds have
been issued, no bonus asked, and all bills
have been discounted. There have been
no advance contracts entered into or solic
ited, and the whole project has been and
will be carried out on a strictly business
basis.
Charles Webb Howard of the Spring
Valley Water Company is the president of
the company, W. F. Goad is the vice
president, C. N. Beal is secretary and
treasurer, while the directorate includes
Albert Miller of the San Francisco Sav
ings Union and E. H. Clark, manager of
the Hearst estate.
An interesting feature of this enter
prise, though not connected directly with
it. is the possibilities which will be cre
ated by it for the mining of the bed of the
Kern River at the point where the power
company is at work. It is known that
this stream both above and below the
point referred to is rich with placer gold,
and much has been extracted from it.
But there is a large space where the
walls are too precipitous and the stream
too swift to permit of its being diverted so
that the bed can be got at and worked. It
is exnected, however, that the power com
pany will at times of low water divert the
entire flow of the river and accordingly
leave the bed bare. In view of this possi
bility several miners have located the bed
of tbe river for the entire distance from
the power-house to the point where the
flume is taken out, and they are confident
that whenever the water shall be diverted
they will find tbe richest kind of rich dig
gings in tne uncovered bed.

The Board of Trade of Vallejo is en
deavoring to obtain data regarding the
condition of the channel between the up

Perkins has sent a second letter to the
board saying he was misinformed at first,
when he attributed the Oregon's not com

the channel was not large enough and that
it needs dredging.

in part as follows:
I hereby tender my resignation as a member
of your body. My reason for so doing is be
cause I cannot indorse the financial plank: in
the platform as passed by tbe Chicago conven
tion. I believe that the financial question is
the question of the hour, made so by that con
vention when it refused to listen to reason or
make any concession.
It is true that when I was elected a member
of your body I was in full sympathy with both
the National and State platforms of the party,
and it might be saia that I still represent
them; but it is also true that since that lime
both this State's and the National Democracy
has seen fit to go back on its past record and in
convention assembled advocate the rankest
kind of class legislation.
I sincerely hope that those parties who are
opposed to repudiation will put another Na
tional ticket in the field and that the party la
this State will get rid of its Populistic inter
lopers and again put itself in line with true
Democratic principles. I must have my
hands free to do all in my power to bring
about such a result.

REPAVE MARKET STREET
Thousands Take Up the Cry
and Are Ready to Do
Battle.
WILL LABOR PERSISTENTLY.
The Cycle Board of Trade Proposes to
Work With a Will for a
Smooth Roadbed.
. "Repave Market street." The slogan
has been sounded and the friends of good
highways are marshaling for an energetic
and persistent: fight The demonstration
of Saturday night is a source of gratifica
tion to wheelmen and others directly in
terested and to the great mass of specta
tors who viewed the line of march it was a
revelation. The showing made by the
cyclists was a fruitful topic of conversation
in the bicycle clubs yesterday afternoon,
and the oninion was enthusiastically ex
pressed that when such a body wants any
thin c nothing can stop it. And the wheel
men want Market street repaved.
"It was a great showing," declared W.
J. Kenny, chairman of the parade com
mittee of the Cycle Board of Trade. "We
have been nearly two months getting
ready for it. and it has entailed no end of
hard work. At first some of the bicycle
clubs seemed reluctant about entering.
Then we went before them oil their meet
ing nights and explained just what we
wanted. When we convinced them that
the board was honestly endeavoring to
start an agitation that would result in bet
ter roads for this City they came up nobly
and the parade, as far as the wheelmen
were concerned, fully came up to our ex
pectations. It took hard and persistent
work, but I suppose that is necessary to
accomplish anything important. Anyway
that is the way we intend to proceed to
get Market street repaved.
"What the bicycle dealers and riders
want most now is some kind of a smooth
pavement from the ferries out Market and
Valencia to Twenty-ninth. We are not
porticular what kind of a pavement.
Macadam would suit us as well as any
thing, but we do want something that a
bicyclist can ride upon without risking his
neck. j We, of course, wish the best pos
sible pavement put down, but we are will
ing to leave it to the judgment of others
what is the best. ' .
"Valencia street is virtually a continua
tion of Market street and it is the main
artery of one of the most populous sec- !
tions of the City. Watch the cars as they
travel along that street .and you will gain
an idea of : the traffic along it. ,- Every car
is : tilled, and before the Mission-street
electric-cars were put on the people were
compelled to stand up inside and hang on
outside. It is the most natural outlet of
the City, yet a bicyclist cannot traverse
that street with safety. His only choice
is between the well-nigh impassable basalt
blocks and a cable-slot, which at places is
two or three inches above the surface of
the street. To slip from the slot it such a
place would mean almost inevitable dis
aster.
"The wheelmen have no desire to have a
road built for them alone. They want a
good, smooth, serviceable road upon
which teamsters can haul to advantage
and which will be a benefit to the whole
people. We intend to keep on agitating
this matter, and we rely for aid and sup
port, as we have had in the past, from the
press, the Merchants' Association, the
teamsters, the improvement clubs and the
great army of enterprising citizens who
believe that pood roads are a necessary
feature of a well-regulated city. We must
have good roads, and we will have them
First of all, Market : street must be re
paved."
A. B. Maguire is one of the most active
members of the executive committee of
the ; South Side clubs. To Mr. Maguire
good roads has become almost a creed,
and the ; suggestion of improvement flits
forth unlimited enthusiasm. Mr. Ma
guire was an aid in the Saturday night
demonstration and expressed himself as
delighted with the turnout which the
wheelmen made.
"What the South Side clubs are now
working for mainly," he said, "is the con
tinuation of the improvement of Folsom
street from Third to the ferries, the block
between Eleventh and Twelfth and the
crossings at Ninth, Eleventh and Twelfth
streets. Then we want the sidewalks re
duced from 19 feet 6 inches to 15 feet
giving the extra width to the roadway. '
. "We are also in favor of repaying Mar
ket street. The present pavement on that
Ftreet is a constant menace to teaming.
The basalt blocks and . cobbles are as
smooth as glass and horses frequently slip
and their power is constantly diminished.
Bitumen partakes of the same fault when
it is wet, and it seems to me something
should be found in which this element is
not present. Personally, I think macadam
makes the best road, but I know a great
many would not aeree with me. :
"Now that the advocates of good roads
have shown their strength, it seems to me
they should determine what kind of pave
ment they want; then, having decided on
that point, demand an appropriation and
stay with it. The great secret of success in
these matters is persistence. Some one
must take the matter in hand and with
tireless energy push it along. It will be a
thankless task. People will impugn the
motives of the leaders, but they must not
get discouraged. Much will depend- on
the press in this matter. In our agitation
for the Improvement of Folsom street the
press.has been our backbone. It has
treated us royally, ana we feel that our
success is due to it. If the united press of
this City decides that Market street must
be repaved It will be done within a year."
The teamsters, who were at first reluct
ant about entering the movement, under
the belief that : bitumen was the only
pavement to be considered, are now heart
and soul with the agitators. A number of
them entered the procession Saturday
night as mounted" aids, and the more
progressive of them have taken up with a
will the slogan: "Repave - Market street."

Branch of the Republican National
League Club to Be
Formed.
A brief and informal meeting of the
committee appointed at a meeting of the
Union League Club a week ago to take
steps toward forming a local branch of
the Republican National League Club was
held yesterday afternoon, Colonel George
Stone of the Union League Club presiding.

Masteller and Tirey L. Ford, who, with
Colonel Stone, compose the committee,
were also preset.
No action was taken in regard to organ
izing the club, but considerable discussion
was carried on and an understanding was
reached as to the best method of proceed
ing in the matter. Next Tuesday another
meeting of the committee will be held,
when the committee will have formulated
a plan for organization and on Wednesday
evening a meeting will be held to organize
the proposed club.
JEHOVAH OR BAAL?
The Rev. Dr. Dille Exhorts His People
to Live Actively In the Lord's
Service.
The sermon preached last evening by
the Rev. E. R. Dille at the Central M. E.
Church was entitled, "A Call 10 Decision."
The text was from Kings, "How long halt
ye between two opinions?"
After referring to the duel of the deities
on Mount Carmel, where, at the request of
the Prophet Elijah, fire descended from
heaven and tbe followers of Baal were
weaned from their idol worship and forced
to recognize Jehovah as the only true
God, tbe speaker said: "When humanity
cries out. every star, every blade of grass,
every flower, every tree, every river, every
brook and every mountain proclaims the
existence of the Lord.
"I say to you, if you believe in Jehovah,
the manly thing for you to do is to follow
him. Many laymen intend eventually to
become Christians, but delay too long, and
at the close of a sinful and selfish life think
to say a prayer, repent and so sliD into
heaven through the infinite mercy of God.
This is a mean policy to pursue, and it is
not always safe to rely for salvation upon a
deathbed repentance.
" 'Tis true that there are many unworthy
Christians in this world, but then the
church is our common mother and we
should be the last to see her faults. Would
that all of our churches were united, then
we should be so strong that we could put
down the saloons and stamp out political
corruption.
"Laymen are as responsible for the sal
vation of souls as churchmen. We should
enter into tbe service of the Lord, not for
our own sakes merely, but because he
needs us to aid in reclaiming our fellows.
Choose then between Jehovah and Baal,
for eternal life is of far greater value than
wealth or temporal power."
Tne speaker illustrated his discourse by
references to current topics.
SOCIALIST LABOR PARTY.
Arrangements to Place a Muni
cipal Ticket in the
Field.
Some Assemblymen Already Selected
for tbe Honor of Representing
Their Party.
The Socialist Labor party at their meet
ing yesterday afternoon took initiatory
steps to the placing of a municipal ticket
in the field for the coming election.
With this object in view a meeting of the
eighteen Assembly District delegates, com
prising 150 members, assembled at Social
Hall, 115 Turk street, yesterday.
The first order of business was announced
by the temporary chairman, H. Sailer, to
be the selection of a permanent secretary
for the general committee. H. Ford was
the unanimous choice of the body for that
office.
According to the standing rule of the
party the secretary has the naming of the
chairman for each meeting. The comrade
selected for the honor of presiding at yes
terday's meeting was G. B. Benham, who
presided over the body.
A caucus of tbe Assembly delegates wts

ECHO FROM CALAVERAS
The "Prospect" Has Its Say
About an Enterprising
Pioneer.
Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Foorman have just re
turned after an extended visit to Mokelumna
Hill. Irurins his stay in Calaveras Mr. Foor
man visited many points of interest, and was
the subject of an in tereatlac interview in that
enterprising newspaper, the Calaveras Pros
pect.
The following extracts from the reported In
terview will be read with interest by the many
triendÃ of the worthy president of" the Moke
lumne and Gampo Seco Canal and Mining Com
pany.
' After paying: a neatly turned and graceful
compliment to the popular pioneer the Pros
pect states: "Mr. Foorman say* he notices a
marked change in San Andreas â a departure
from the placid, easy-going days of yore, and
a painful absence of many old-timers, princi
pally old Ben Hawei, without whom he de
clares the place no longer looks like the old
Ban Andreas.
"The company which Mr. Foorman represents
is the oldest in the country, and Its works
cover an area of something like forty or fifty
miles, extending from the mountainous re
gions around West Point to the valley lands of
the San Joaquin.
"With the revival of mining in that end of
the country the company has largely extended
its works and new systems have lately been in
troduced at different points along the line,
principally in the vicinity of Valley Spring.
The Rood that end of the country has derived
through the company's work is invaluable,
and its system has done more toward develop
ing tbe mineral and agricultural resources ot
the country in their locality than any other

LINCOLN, Nebb., July 26.â Myriads of
grasshoppers, in clouds so dense as to al
most obscure the sun, passed over this
section of Nebraska to-day about noon.
Their appearance caused apprehension
among farmers, but few alighted. Their
course was from west to east Tbe last
grasshopper scourge in Nebrasea was in
1874, and as they usually make their ap
pearance much earlier in the season it is
thought the present visitation does not
presage any serious damage to crops in
this locality.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 27, 1896.
SERGEANT CURTIS
WON THE MEDAL
Quarterly Rally First Dis
trict League of the
Cross Cadets.
TWO PARISHES COMPETE
Splendid Literary Productions
Rendered With Oratorical
Power.
THE PRIZE A BADGE OF SILVER
Sergeant Curtis Will Be One of the
Four Contestants for the Gold
Medal Next Year.
Mission Parlor Hall was far too small
to accommodate the immense number who
came to the grand rally of the League of
the Cross Cadets of the first district. This
Sergeant A. B. Cnrtis of Company I, League of tbe Cross Cadets, Who Won the
Silver Medal at the Quarterly Rally Yesterday.
includes the parishes of St. James', St.
Peter'a and St. Paul's churches.
The principal feature was the first con*
test of the second series of essays on
"What Drunkenness Costn," by competi
tors from the three parishes. The prize
for the most meritorious production and
best delivery was a silver medal. The
winner will be one of the four district
contestants in the final battle at tbe Me
chanics' Pavilion a year from August 9.
Arthur B. Curtis of St. Peter's Parish,
sergeant of Company I, League of the
Cross Cadets, captured tbe medal in a
splendid effort of eloquence and rhetorical
brillancy. The parish of St. James did
not enter the contest, thus leaving the
chosen orators of St. Peter's and St. Paul's
to strive for the medal.
The platform was occupied by Chairman
Charles B. Fenn, Rev. P. 0. Ryan, Rev.
James McDonald, Sergeant A. E. Curtis,
Company I; Lieutenant Charles Skelley,
Company I; Captain Peter J. Haggerty,
Thomas H. Murlow, Joseph H. Donald
son, Charles Willie, Captain James H.
Reilly, Company X; Lieutenant James
O'Neil, Company X, and Captain D. Mc-
Carthy, Company Â£.
Tbe rally was opened by a hymn and a
prayer offered by Father O' Ryan, spiritual
director of the league, after which was
rendered an instrumental duet by Miss
Pauba and Mrs. Fenn.
Lots were then drawn by the two con
testants for the first reading, which fell to
Sergeant Curtis. He spoke in substance
as follows:
"That the intemperate use of intoxicating
liquors is an evil of immense and incalcu
lable magnitude at the present day there
are few who will deny; nor will it be
questioned by any who have bad partici
pation in criminal proceedings that it is
one of the most fruitful sources of crime."
He said that tbe amount of money spent
for liquor all over the world was enormous,
and he quoted statistics to abow that
England expended annually over Â£125,
--000,000 for alcohol, while America expend
ed $1,474,000,000 annually.
"Aside, however, from the immense
monetary loss," he continued, "and tbe
inevitable misery due to indulgence in
liquor its evil effects on man may be taken
in three ways: First, on the moral man;
second, on the physical, and third, on the
spiritnal nature.
"Liquor destroys the Image of God in
man and lowers him to the level of the
brutes. No other evil has caused such
sorrow and misery. Broken homes, blast
ed hopes and wasted lives result from it.
Intellect is ruined and principle is sacri
ficed to it."
Tbe successful young orator was warmly
applauded when he sat down.
A musical solo by Miss Annie Doyle fol
lowed, after which was a recitation by
Sergeant McCrystal.
Then followed the second essay by
Joseph D. Donaldson of St. Paul's Parish.
He spoke well and received frequent ap
plause.
"Oar subject," said he, "is one that com
pletely defies the power of eloquence to
describe. The immense sum of money
annually expended in America for drinK
is drained largely from the hard-worked
laboring classes.
"Go to the weeping mother and tbe
heart-broken sister and ask them what
sorrow drunkenness causes. Let as not for
get that the corruption of Rome, Persia
and Carthage was caused by intemper
ance."
The glee club of Company A then sang
"Just Before the Battle, Mother," in a
manner that won them much applause.
Their singing was followed by the address
ofthÂ« afternoon by Rev. James McDonald
of St. Peter's, who said that people from
reading the reports in the papers and hear
ing the people talk, were led to believe
that the world is in a veiy bad way. He
said that one-half of the country wants
gold and.tbe other half silver, bat no one
can aay that the country, no matter what
metal is chosen, will be any better off on
November 6 than it was on May 8.
"No political party will do away with all
the evil in the world," he said. "I am not
a prophet, bnt I have a cure. The thing
we want so badly and the thing that will
will save our country is an honest man.
"So far as honesty is concerned, both in
public and private life, there is very little
of it. Honest men have come to the con*
elusion that both good and bad politicians
are tarred with the same brush. Nobody
goes into politics but for what there
is in it. No nation ever became
great or powertul which waÃ built on a
rotten foundation. The ages of chivalry
have past and we have now advanced
civilisation, but there is a vast difference
between the ideal of the gentleman of to
day and of then. Kind hearts, courteous
words, unselfishness, purity of heart and
mind will make the world as it should
be."
The judges for the essay were Professor
Knowlton, Frank B. Lorrigan and MUs
Shay. At tbe conclusion of the address
Professor Knowlton announced that Ser
geant Curtis had won the literary and
oratorical victory by thirteen points, and
Father O'Ryan then pinned on the coat of
the victor tbe silver medal.
SCANLAN'S SUCCESSOR.
Channcor Olcott I'omei to Sing in a
Hi c h-Toned Irish Flay.
Chauncey Olcott. the successor of Min
strel Scanlan in Irish plays, arrived Sat
urday afternoon from the East. His
mother, Mrs. P. J. Brennan of Buffalo, ac '
companied him.
"I nave had a delightful trip westward,"
said Mr. Olcott, "and feel that it has done
me a world of good.
"It feels like being at home to be here
once more. I don't want you to publish
that I said I am very fond of San Fran
cisco. People will laugh and say, "ThÂ»
old gag'; but, nevertheless, it is so. Some
of the happiest days of my life were spent
in this City, and I feel as" if it were the
place in which I made my first success as
a singer, even though it was in a modest
way. It is fully twelve years, but it seems
like yesterday that I stood up in the 'first
part' in the Emerson Minstrels and sang
the 'Blue Alsatian Mountains.'
"Mj life has been rather eventful since
then. After pottering around in other
minstrel companies, with the 'Old Home
stead' and other plays, I went to England
and settled down to study singing. I had
an idea of fitting myself for grand opera,
and vmnt to work in earnest with thai
famous old master Alberto Randesger.
"I began to play Irish roles in London.
Charles Wyndham heard me sing at a
concert one night, and as be had the pro
duction oi 'Miss Helyett' in mind at the
time he offered me the part of Don
Patricius Julius Caesar O'Flanagan, tbe
Irish toreador. I had no con lid en cc in
my ability to play an Irish character part,
never having essayed one, and after re
hearsing it for two weeks became so thor
oughly frightened that I went to Mr.
Wyndham and asked to be released from
playing it. He was very kind and talked
me into trying ii. When the opera was
produced I made quite a success. The
London papers said I did, anyhow. I
Bang in 'Blue-Eyed Susan' aud other
operas while in London and one day re
ceived a communication from Augustus
Pitou of New York.
"When Scanlan broke down, Mr. Pitou
waited in vain for same signs of improve
ment and then looked around for some
one to fill the comedian's place. Some
friends of his had seen me playing in
'Miss Helyett,' and wrote him about my
per.ormance of tbe Irish toreador. So he
sent for me. To go into Irish comedy was
to give up the grand opera career which
had been the height of my ambition; yet
to fill a place of such importance in the
field offered was no slight honor. After
thinking it over and getting some advice.
I decided to accept Mr. Pitou's offer. I
came over to New York, and made my
debut in 'Mavourneen,' the play in
which I will open at the California
Theater.
"The class of drama which I am giving
is the realization of a dream of Messrs.
Pitou and Scanlan. The latter bad beer,
developing up from tbe simple peasant to
something better and had just about
reached the acme of bis ambition when
be met with his terrible misfortune.
â¢Mavoumeen,' for instance, is a story of
Dublin a hundred years ago. when it vied
with London and Paris as the fashionable
ccn ter of Europe. As our story deals with
the fashionable set the costumes are very
elegant, the minuet, for instance, being
dancea in silka and satins."
Another Death by Gai.
Maria Scott, aged 63 years, was found dead
in her bed at 623 Larkin street yesterday
morning from the effects of gas. From the ap
pearance of the gas jet and other surrounding
circumstances the Coroner's deputies came to
th <; conclusion that the act was accidental.
Tbe deceased was the widow ot Captain
bcott. an army officer, who had served iv the
Union army during the late rebellion. She
wa i ? pensioner on the bounty of Uncie Sam,
and belonged to the Women's Belief Corps.
She leaves a son in Colorado, H. C. Martin,

LED BY A DOG TO
AN UNMADE GRAVE.
The Animal's Piteous Cries
Attracted Attention at
Laurel Hill.
WAS THE ONLY MOURNER
Strange Discovery of the Bcdy
of an Ud known
Man.
HAD BEEN DEAD SOME TIME.
Dumb Sympathy Exhibited by the
Only Friend of the Dead
Man.
It was by the whims of a dogâ a lonely
neglected, friendless little creature â that
the dead body of an unknown man was
found in Laurel Hill Cemetery yesterday.
It had lost its master, and for three days
it tried to attract the attention of passers
by and lead them to where the body lay.
It was followed by a lad y yesterday, and
bounding along the path it brought her to
an unmade grave, and then with a moan
it cnrled up by tbe head of what had once
been its master.
The body lay in an unfrequented po
tion of Laurel Hill Cemetery and it had
evidently been there several days, it was
that of a man apparently about 60 years
of age, attired in a brown suit of clothes,
white shirt and black- tie. A much-worn
slouch bat lay a few feet from the body,
where it was dropped as its owner, it is
presumed, stricken with heart disease,
reeled and fell to the ground dead.
Without doubt the dead man was the
master of the dog. During the last few
days the little animal had been frequently
seen wandering around the cemetery. A
number of attempts to drive it away were
unsuccessful; it always returned, and
would whine piteously as though in sor
row. Yesterday afternoon Mrs. L. C.
Ayer, who resides at 6400 Mission street,
had occasion to visit the cemetery.
She had not been there long, however,
before the peculiar actions of the dog at
tracted her attention. It appeared to be
making an attempt to inform her regard
ing some unusual occurrence some dis
tance away. Mrs. Aver finally decided to
follow the dog which had so singularly at
tracted her. She did, and tbe little mes
senger led her to the body of its master.
Mrs. Ayer then notified H. N. Pearson,
assistant superintendent of the cemetery,
as to her discovery. The Coroner's office
was then notified, and Deputy Coroners
O'Brien and Smith went to remove tbe
body to the Morgue. When they arrived
the little dog went up to the body and,
crouching up close by the head, refused to
leave.
It was carried some distance away in
the hope that it would remain, but as soon
as it was released it hurried back and
once more lay down by its master's head.
The body was finally deposited in the re
ceiver, and the little dog. the only
mourner, was tacen to the cemetery house.
The body was taken to the Morgue, but
thÂ» forlorn little animal still whines piti
fully in his loneliness.
' The latest watch is a marvel of inge
nuity. It is the size of a small solitaire,
and is intended to be worn as tbe button
of a shirt or a sleeve.

VARICOCELE.
the Most Weakening of All the Bad

cocele. This disease is a swollen condition
of the ;| veins, which become . weaK and

culation, unhealthy perspiration and - ex-
treme weakness. Ii drains and drags the
vital energy; from the body. It destroys
strength; it ruins the nervous system, and
makes men unfit for society, business or
pleasure. :r\
Do you suffer from it? Watch yourself
carefully. It creeps upon its victim

symptoms it may sap the foundation from

SOLD FOR FOOD.
The Board of Health Will
Stop the Nefarious
Traffic.
A MENACE TO HEALTH.
Tc-Day the First Effort to Pre
vent the Sale Will Be
Made.
VIGOROUS ACTION PROMISED
A Band of Sick Cows Driven Into
San M teo County to Avoid
Inspection.
The Board of Health will begin an in
vestigation to-day into the disposition of !
cows suffering from tuberculosis, It has
been brought to the attention of the board
that some unscrupulous persons have
taken diseased cows from dairy ranches in
the County of San Francisco and sold the
animals to butchers for slaughter. This
was done to avoid the loss of the cows,
â¢which appeared inevitable in case of an
examination of their condition by the
Board of Health Inspectors.
The owners of these infected cattle knew
very well that the official inspectors would
Instantly kill all cows afflicted with tuber
culosis and so they sold the. sick animals.
By thus taking time by the forelock the
owners, so it is stated, have got fair prices
for cows the fate of which was already
sealed. This startling news set the mem
bers of the Board of Health thinking very
hard for a day or two, and they have all
come to the same conclusion â that imme
diate steps must be taken to stop this dan
gerous traffic in consumptive cows, and
also to institute legal proceedings against
all parties caught at it.
Dr. Henry H. Hart of the Board of
Realm was indignant yesterday when he
discussed the question. He branded the
traffic in tuberculous cattle as murderâ the
meanest, most contemptible kind of mur
der, it was strong language, but it came
irom a physician .who knew what he was
saving.
'If these cows are being slaughtered
and sold for meat it is a terrible thing,"
he said. "It is monstrous. I intended to
consult with some members of the board
this morning about it, bat was prevented
by an urgent call. I snail, however, bring
the matter before the board to-morrow,
and more than likely some action will be
taken to put an end to this disgraceful
work.
"Suppose a dairyman is informed that
his cows are suffering from tuberculosis.
there is where a crime is batched at once
if the dairyman should sell them. It's a
crime when any one will sell cattle for food
knowing it to be diseased, the foulest kind
of a crime done in a secret way. For the
sake of a few dollars he makes, thousands
of people are exposed to the dangers of
eating meat full of the germs of consump
tion. Of course, some people are constitu
tionally strong enough to withstand it.
It's true the disease zerms are killed by
heat, but the heat of cooking meat is not
enough to kill the germ*. While the
germs are most likely killed in the well
done parts, they are alive in the rare por
tions. You may get them in the red,
juicy part of your steak.
''One tubercular cow in a band in time
will communicate the disease to the whole
band. Drinking at the same trough or
stream, eating with other cows quickly
spreads the disease.
'â¢If all boards of health throughout the
United States are as energetic as we I
think this thing of Germany refusing to
take American meat for fear of disease
will soon be a thing of the past. Disease
is being stamped out thoroughly and
effectively, and there is as good beef here
as anywhere in the world.* We are stamp
ing out disease as fast as we can, and it
won't be very long before everything will
be in complete working order wÂ».h pure
food stations for the examination of food.
"It may seem rather hard to destroy
twenty or thirty, or more cows that suffer
from tuberculosis, hard on the dairyman;
but what is that compared to thousands
of human lives sacrificed by selling dis
eased meat or milk? in my opinion 75
per cent, if not more of the babies, have
died in large cities, and particularly in
infant asylums from tae milk of diseased
animals. -
"The people themselves ought to get up
in arms against any person or persons
known to sell meat that has been con
demned as diseased. In fact, the
people should patronize butchers that
they know would not do a thing of
that kind. It is deliberate murder. There
is no crime as great as that where a mur
der is committed in this secret way. If
you meet your assailant openly you can
defend yourself, but in this case you can't.
You are dimply eating your own poison in
the meat given you.
"I am under the impression, that there
is from 40 to 60 per cent of the dairy cows
diseased. I think that the dairymen are
perfectly honest and do not know that
their cows are diseased until a test is
made. All dairymen have a perfect right
to have a veterinary surgeon present dur
ing an examination by the Board of
Health. The board is only doing its duty
to the people, and its members are simply
carrying out their oath of office." '
Dr. J. M. Williamson will advocate
prompt and decisive action by the board
in regard to the sale of consumptive cows.
"In my opinion," he said yesterday,
"this matter should be dealt with rigor
ously. It is strongly possible that if cattle
of that stamp are sold for human food the
germs of consumption will reach the peo
ple, and if the one who eats this meat is
in a right condition for the deposition of
the genus in his system he is liable to be
afflicted with consumption.
â¢â¢I think that any dairyman caught sell
ing diseased, tuberculous cattle to any
butcher who buys that meat and exposes
it for safe ought to be dealt with crimi
nally. Meat Inspectors now saturate con
demned meat with coal oil so toat it can
not be used . for food. It is well known
that condemned meat has been followed
, to the fertilizing works and taken back to
Chinatown to be sold for food. So it is ap
parent that an efficient force of inspectors
is necessary to watc Â» the food prepared
for consumption in the City.
"With an extremely limited force of in
spectors tnis thing A selling tuberculous
meat may be done for quite a long time
before being detected. It argues strongly
in tavor of an increased appropriation,
which we have'asked for to better protect
tee health of the City.
'I have been informed that a band of
5r y cattle n San Francisco were pri
vately inspected for tuberculosis and driven
over the line into San Mateo County. And
the milk from that consumptive band is
.now coming into San Francisco for sale.
1 could not ascertain to what dairy this
band belongs. We can't watch the county
line, of course, but with regard to killing
si.k cows anA selling them for food we j
shall do wliaSle <-an to put an end to iv"

AN OLD-FASHIONED GAME
Oakland Ball-Players Defeat the
Californias in a Hard-
Hitting Contest
Local Men Do the Best Stick Work
and Make Fewer Errors, but
Are Shy on Rues,
There was a real old-fashioned game of
ball at the Folscm-street grounds yester
day afternoon. The new Californias and
the Oaklands participated and the way
they banged the ball about the lot was a
caution to amateur pitchers. The Cali
fornias did the most of the swatting and
made fewer errors than the Oaklands, but
were deficient in runs when the game was
over.
Sykes' batting waa the feature of the
game. Out of five timej at bat he made
three hits, two of which were three-bag
gers. Wilds also did well, securing a triple
and a single. For the Oakland^ Agnew
made a double and two singles out of five
chances, but strange to say be feiled to
score a run.
"Pudgy" Arlett carried off the palm as
a gatherer of tallies. He succeeded in
safely making the circuit no less than
lour times. Kuasell, Donovan. Hardie and
O'Xeiii made three each. Sykes scored
three times for the local men.
Although the Californias started off in
the iead. tne result of the game was never
in doubt after the third inning. The
score then stood 8 to 5 in tneir favor.
They added another to tneir total in the
fourth, four more in the fifth, one in the
sixth, four in the eighth and two in the
| ninth. The Califoruias finished well, send
inz five men across the rubber in the
seventh and four in the final inning, but
were five runs *by when the last man
was out.

awarded to the "Saturday Press* team by
a technical score of 9to 0. In the eighth
inning tie winners were well in the lead,

and because his protest â¢ was not allowed,
called bis men from the field.

SAN FRANCISCOS WON.
They Played All Round the Stock-
ton Home Team Yesterday.
STOCKTON, Cax., July 26.â San Fran
cisco played all around the Stockton base
ball men Uwiay. The strong point of the
Sockton nine has been its fielding, but to
day the local men could not stop the ball
with a scoop-Met, while the visitors did
some of as pretty fie. ding as is seen on the
baseball field. Sweeney, who played at
third for San Francisco, made a jump for a
high drive in the seventh, and puiled it
down amid the cheers of the crow i.
There waa a good crowd at the game to
day, and it was willing to cheer for both
the visiting and home tÂ«am when any good
work was done. In the seventh inning
there was a pretty double play by Stock
well,- Stockton's left-fielder, to Babe White
at second, and to Stewart at first.
It was a long drive to deep center, and
Stockwell scooped it in time.
The Stocktons' men hit Eber. but they
played in hard luck every time, while the
roor fieldine of the Stocktons permitted
the visitors to make many an unearn<>d
run. Pace, the Stocktons' catcher, did
some good work with the stick as usual.
and De Costa pitched good ball. Had he
received any sort ot suppo~t the score
would bare told a different story. Follow

light, which was a little uncertain at
times, some fine scores were made. How
ard Carr was on the ranee with a fine 30
--catiber Winchester magazine rifle" of the
latest pattern, which taiesthenew smoke
less cartridge.
He was experimenting with a telescope ;
attachment, and despite all that has been !
stated about the new srr.ekeiessamrauni- '
tion carrying the steel- jacce ted and the i
"soft-nosed" bullets being inaccurate on [
the 200-yard ranges, Carr made some ve-y
rretty patterns on the Columbia target.
He also used Dlack powder, but the n.tro :
proved its equal for accuracy and the
speed and penetration were much greater.
While many are loth to part with the o;d
black powaer, their decision as to mer is ta
due more to prejudice than actual tens
and experiments.
For an hour or so there was consider- !
able interest manifest in a fifty-shot 22- i
caliber rifle match between E. Jacobson j
and Smith Carr for a small purse. The
shooting was on the Columbia target, fifty
yards, off and. Several weeks ago these I
two sharpshooters met and Jacobson i
won. He gave Carr a return match,
and when they met yesterday each was
determined to win. Jacobson proved the
'Uperior of the two. He won by a score of
121 to Carr's 144. By Creedmore count
Jacobson's score was 229.
One of the happiest marksmen on the
pistol range was A. H. Pape. While
shooting in the Bland ing medal match he
broke all previous pistol records with a !
â¢core of 1, 2, IâL1 â L In other words, two of I
his bclWs punctured the inch center and j
the other shot was less than half an inch I
from the center. This puts him ahead of
Daisa in the ten best scores. In the ten
best scores Pape stands 77, DaiÂ«s S2 and â¢
Gorman yesterday pulled ahead to S3.
Yesterday' s records show the following i
to have made the most flags (or one-inch
centers) during the month: PistolâGor

flags or centers entilie the marksmen to '
the cash prizes in each match stated.
On the 200-yard range the Columbia's
members did considerable practicing, but
only a few record scores were made. F. E.
Mason ran up a practice str.ng of such
merit that it was a pity it was not on a
record match. His nits were 1, 5, 5, 6, 2, 4,
3, 4. 8, 3, total 41, which is a score'that is
hard to beat. The records on the Coium

ATTACKED BY A BIG BEAR
Charles J. Collins Has a Start
ling Experience Near
Pieta.
He Shot Bruin From a Tree and Was
Knocked Senseless by the
Beast
A letter has been received from Charles
J. Collins, telling of his encounter with a !
bear â > while hunting deer in " the canyons â¢
near Pieta. as follows :
On Wednesday I started out on a deer hunt
with a few friends. The Vassar accom
panied â  as, and their dog* soon got on the
track of deer. We killed some does, and on
the return home th- hunters discovered the
tracks of a bear, wnich the d gs followed.
Bruin was discovered hidden away In a
ledge of rocks, and tne dogs giving him a hard
chase, he found refuse in a tree. I happened
to be near at hand when the don forced Mr.
Bear to seek safety in the forks of a redwood,
and, of course. 1 wa* anxious to distinguish
myself as a second D-ivy Crockett. ZrWufipns
' Having :horocÂ«;nly tested the shooting quali
ties or my Winchester, 1 determine! to make
that old bear sick by filling his shaggy carcsss
! full of lead. Taking deliberate aim at hi* eye
âwhich, as you know, is me only spot I shoot
at when hunting lartre and treacnerocs game,
I fired and down rolled the black rascal appar
ently as dead as a mackerel.
You have not tue remotest idea of how I felt
when I -aw my game land up against a rock
without a kick. Intact I actually considered
that my record was established as a bear
hu'iter. I was as proud as a Golden Gate pea
; cock and lost no time in yanking from my
i scabbard that treacherous-looking hunting
| knife which job were so anxious to. know
j what I proposed doing with on mv hunting
\ expeditlon.3ri>BMpÃMNfPW . / _. â 
v Well. I walked op to rhat old black rascal,
feeling that I could "do" him any now, dead
or alive. The inÂ«Unt I stuck the steel into his
neck Mr. Black, who was only stunned by the
bullet, raised up on his hind feet and, as quick
as a flash, he landed an uppercu: on my neck
which sent me folly five yards down the gulch.
When lr covrred my equilibrium Mr. Bear
and the dogs were having a rough-and-tumble
contest at my feet, and before I could realize
j what was going on I received the worst smash
i of allâ a right eonnter in the ribs, which blow
doubled me up like a iackknife. I was com
pletely done ud. and I eueÂ»s that my name
would have been McGinnis instead of Coiiin
had it not been for. the timely arrival of 1 the
huuters, who quickly dispatched Mr. Bruin. ,
The bear â¢ weighed â¢ 450 pounds, and I am
more : than -pleased, althouen. still suftVrlt.g
: from the attack; that 1- am alive and able to
' writ* yon this ;.. interesting account of my

NO WOMEN ARE
WANTED THERE.
Offending Sign Board on a
Downtown Lodg
ing- House.
LADIES AEE INDIGNANT.
Miss Mary Hay Says Women
Should Not Be Discrimi
nated Agairst.
DECLABES THEM NUISANCES.
Mrs- Emma Sweet Says Lady Ten*
ants Take Too Many Liberties
About a House.
"No rooms rented to women" is the un
gallant legend emblazoned in black letter
ing on a huge yellow sign which adorns
the front of a recently refitted lodging
house on Montgomery street above Bush.
The fair sex do not like that sign. They
glance at it superciliously as they trudge
along ou the opposite side of the street and
more than one lady bachelor has commit
ted herself to the extent of saying it was
"too mean for anything."
For the sisn is an indication of an un
welcome atate of facts. The hitherto
gallant metropolis ot the West is taking
on the customs of the effete East, and
proprietors are beginning to discrimi
nate against the ladies. Tbe Mcn;Â«omery
street house is not the nrÂ»: to establish
such a rule. More pretentious hostelries
in the more fashionable carts of town have
lone since adopted the strict. v masculine
rule, but they have done so in a meek,
apologetic sort of a way that has incited
contempt rather than animosity.
The Montgomery-street house is the tint
to dine forth bo'.diy the gage of battle,
and now the ladies propose to look into
thi* matter some, and see whether or no
they are to be discriminated against at
the boarding house as well as at the ballot
box.
Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Blinn. when told
of the tira'dity of the downtown lod^ing
honse keepers, said that such a rule would
probably result in trouble for some one.
"1 have long known that women bad
trouble getting desirable quarters
here," she said. "I have a
friend, a widow of mosr estim
able character, who started out to
seek lodgings. She was very rnucb to-
I noyed by the persistent questioning of tbe
i proprietresses, and she almost despaired
of hnding a room. Being like C
wife, above suspicion, the inquires of the !
lodgine-housf keepers were inexplicable to
her. Perhaps a few letters of recommen
dation would have male tbe matter all
right, but she certainly had a most un
comfortable time of it."
Mis* Mary Hay, National organiser of
the suffrage society, expressed the opinion
that the d:Â«crimir.a:ion was unkind and
nnjast. "Women may be a trifle more
particular than an<?n.'"' she said. "They
naturally would be, for they understand
what housekeeoing n. and would probably
demand tha: toings be conducted right, i
Women alone in a lodging-hou-e might, j
too, demand favors w- ich men would not I
ask. Dut wbai are we here for if ir ;s not to
aid one another? Ido not believe women
' are sufficiently 'fussy' and disagreeable as
I tenants to warrant any lodging-nouse
: keeper in ruling against th a m."
Mrs. Emma Sweet, private secretary for
Susan B Anthony, declared that there
was nothing about the Montgomery-street j
lodging-house aim which made her blood |
boil. "In New York unless a woman has
the marks of Metbusaleh upon Ler,"' she
declared, "it is next to impossible
for her to get a room, and even then
lit is no easy matter. Women are
1 a nuisance about a lodging-house.
They want to borrow a natiron, then they
wish to use the laundry: they ut: : â¢
j kitchen stove, and tsice liberties with : he
i sewing-machine. All these things are an
annoyance to a landlady, and I do not
I wonder they prefer men, who, as a usual
j thine, can pay more and demand le*s."
Mrs. Sweet recounted an interesting ex
perience ot her girlhood days in Roches -
i ter, New York, where only by the influ
ence ( f tne utmost persuasion ahe was
able to get a room in a desirable family.
The proprietor of the offending house
declares that, beine a single man, he is
very partial to ladies, but desinne to keep
j his bouse in good repute he did not care
< to take upon himself the task of passing
upon the moral attributes of lady ten
nants. He express d profound ignorance of
their being nuisances about a house.
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Ryan and Kodfrn Defeat McÂ»itl and
McDonald, Which Decide* a Long
standing Dispute. ~
. Handball was booming yesterday, the
courts being crowded. At the San Fran
cisco court a match that excited the great
est interest was played between Phil Ryan,
the proprietor of the court, and D. Rodg
ers against M. McNeil! and M. McDonald.
There had been a long-standing dispute as
to which was the better team, and yester
day was settled upon to decide the matter.
The match was won by Ryan and Rodgers
after some brilliant playing on both (ides.
Ryan had the wisdom to spend Friday
and Saturday in Maria County, and the
pure ozone of Tocaloma and Nicasio had
a wonderful effect upon him. McNeill
trained 0:1 French dinners, and before the '
match was half through he felt sorry for !
it and promised his backers that he would
never do it again.
P. T. Donnelly, the amateur champion,
and D. Connelly defeated G. Hutchinson
I and P. Kelly, after an exciting struggle. . ,
At the Union Court the event ot the day
'â â  was a match between J. Hariow, the ex
coast champion, and Al Pennoyer and J.
iJ. Feeney and M. J. Dillon. Itwaaaereat
! game and was won by Feeney and Dillon
in a close finish, chiefly- owing to the
splendid service . of Dillon. .Terry Mc-

spectators. The men were very evenly
matched, and as a result there were some
exciting finishes.

BOHEMIAS WIN
The Alameda Cricket Eleven Defeated
by Over Sixty Eon* at
Alanieda.
There was only. one, cricket match for
the Hunter-Harrison cup played yester
day. It was between the Alameda and ;
Bohemian. clubs, was played at Alameda
and resulted in a victory for the . Bo
hemians by 63 runs on the final innings.
Captain Hogue of the Alamedas won
the toss and sent his opponents in.
Thanks principally to the bowling ,of
Sloman, the scoring was anything but
rapid or formidable, and bad it not been
for the ever invincible William Robertson,
who put up 57 with his wonted noncha
lance, the side would have made no show- ;
in at all. As it was, the total reached
only So and things looked favorable for the <
Alamedas.
Bat the uncertainty of the game is pro
verbial. As with the bat, so with, the ball
the Bohemian chief did deadly havoc.
Not one Alameda man attained double
figures, and the entire side was dismissed
for 22 runs. ' The bowling analysis tells
the story * more . graphically than could
columns of words.
Following on, the Alamedas, thanks to
Hood, made a more respectable record,
but the 96 rens compiled did not affect the
resultâ much in favor of their foes.

GARRET A. HOBART, or New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
"Is this a nomination I see before me,"
says Watson, "or a dream?"
If the Populists vote at all this year
they will have to vote for spite.
If Bryan really does not want that nomi
nation he had better send it to Grover for
bait.
The Populist ratification meetings are
eoing to be among the liveliest humors of
the season.
Sewall will have to stand, for the simple
reason that he cannot sit down after the
Populist kick.
Now is the time for alert Republicans to
begin to hunt up the laggards and make
them register.
The Democratic donkey has the satis
faction of knowing he kicked the Populist
cart sky-high anyhow.
Many an old war Democrat will support
McKinley and oppose anarchy as bravely
as he opposed disunion.
The free coinage of campaign literature
is going rapidly on upon a ratio of pampn
lels to the voter of about 1G to 1.
If the goldbug Democrats will now get
together and give their exhibition the
campaign will take rank as the gayest on
record.
Don Cameron's piatform is terse and
businesslike. He says: "I shall vote for
McKinley. lam for free silver, but I'm
not a fool."
The Populists will now have to make a
strong fignt for their State and Congres
sional tickets. If they lose them they are
gone coons.
Senator Daniel of Virginia is on his way
to Europe. He indorses Mr. Bryan of
course, but evidently prefers to let some
one else work for him.
If conservative Democrats do not like to
join Republican clubs they ought to or
jranize clubs of their own and work for
business and prosperity.
By way of beginning tbe amenities of
the campaign, a Gold Democrat in New
York suggests that the Chicago nomina
tion should ba called the pickpocket ticket.
Bryan's statement: "There will be no
sign up to keep off the grass when I am
President," in being widely quoted in the
East, and will probably capture Coxey's
army to a man.
Business men who are uniting for the
prosperity of the Nation should unite also
for the prosperity of the City. Let us
make it this year a clean sweep for good
government all alone the line.
What was done in the Populist Conven
tion will not have much effect on the cam
paign, but as a matter of passing curiosity
a good many people would like to know
how it happened to be done that way.
in writing of the St. Louis Convention,
several English papers referred toÃt. Louis
as a city in Massachusetts, and now both
the city and the State are denouncing
British ignorance as if It were an insult.
Professor William G. Sumner of Yale,
the noted freetrader, who has long been a
pillar of strength to New England Demo
crats, has turned his back on the Bryan
crowd, and is reported to have said the
action at Chicago was a suicide caused by
insanity.
The only danger that now confronts the
business of the country is the tendency
among business men (0 be too sanguine of
the election of McKinley. These people
should remember that all discontented
persons are for Bryan and that all of them
will vole.
British opinion is now so favorable to
arbitration with America, there can be
no question an international agreement
in favor of bimetallism could be reached
if we on onr side would intrust the matter
loconsenrative statesmen instead of ex
tremists.
It is believed that Gorman hopes to be
come the actual, if not the nominal, head
of the Democratic executive committee,
and the argument is that while he is not
very eager to elect anybody there are a
stood many little foes in the party whom
he wishes to make sure of killing.
It is assorted that when Bryan was a
member of Congress he obtained for the
Lincoln postoffice a passenger elevator.
When this was erected it bad on Us front
a German silver plate whicn had engraved
upon it: "This elevator was secured by
Congressman William J. Bryan." To that
extent, therefore, is Bryan's name re
corded as a practical statesman*
REPUBLICAN VICTORY.
The assurance ot a sweeping Republican
victory in this year's election which pos
sessed the public mind two months ago
has been made more certain by the re-
Bults of tne recent conventions. If the
condition of the Democratic party was
desperate before its convention met, it is
now pitiable. Never since tbe nomination
of Greeley has it been so divided iv its
councils or no untrue to its statesmen and
its principles. Abandoned by its thought
ful and consistent adherents and abandon
ing tbe only leaders who have achieved its
victories in the National and State elec
tions of tbe last thirty years, it has no
reason left for existence nor right to suc
cess.
Tbe Populist party by the follies of the
past few days has so enmeshed itself in
dilemmas, and so entangled itself with
Democracy, that its defeat is equally as
sured. It has stultified its past in the
nomination of a Democrat, who lias al
ready refused to stand upon its platform,
and by so doing it has abandoned the very
principles which gave it birth, if Popu
lism is not tbe party of extreme paternal
ism it is nothing. Its prophet and its
priest was Edward Bellamy, and its later
apostles bave been the advocates of Gov
ernment control over the great agencies
of production and trade.
These doctrines are the extreme an
titheses of Democracy and Bryan as a
Democrat cannot adopt them without
treason to the chief tenet of the Demo
cratic party. The result is self evident.
In the indorsement of a candidate who
does not indorse it the Pooulist party has
invited defeat in the first National cam
paign wherein it had a hope or chance of
success.
In order to make disaster more certain,
both for itself and for the Democrats, the
Populist party repudiated the running
mate of Bryau and named a Vice-Presi
dential candidate of its own.
This of necessity divides the vote for
Bryan, as well as for Bewail and Watson,
in every State and thus insures Repub
lican electors in each doubtful one at
least. It also furnishes a reasonable hope
of Republican success in the South and
makes such great States as New York,
Illinois and Indiana no longer doubtful.
The consequence is easily foreseen. Tbe
thoughtful and order-loving people of tbe
Nation are turning to the Republican
party as their only means of escape from
the evils of depression and distress into
wbich the Democratic blundering of the
past three years has plunged the country.
They will no more trust the Populists
with the keeping of tbe Republic's order
a rid honor than they would have trusted
the Democrats again. They will vote for
a change to the patriotism, protection and
prosperity of Republican rule. It is this
growing feeling which makes more cer
tain every day the election of McKinley
and the triumph of the principles of na
tional honor and duty which he repre
sents.
THAT "CROWN OF THORNS."
The crown of thorns wbich Bryan said
should not be placed upon the brow of
labor now ornaments the bowed head of
Populism, and in a little while it will be
jammed down to tne eyes and ears. Poor
betrayed Populism ! Let it sing :
It is so soon that 1 am done for,
I wonder what 1 was brgun for.
The Populist National Committee is
clothed with almost plenary power,
and it is dominated by Bryan's
professional tricksters and manipula
tors. Naturally the next move will
be to withdraw Watson and leave the
field clear to the Maine National banker
and oppressor of labor. Already Bryan's
managers are claiming that tbe Populist
Convention thrust the nomination upon
him, and consequently he is that party's
candidate without pledge or promise of
any sort, so far as the platform is con
cerned. Then, if that be so, what was the
sense of formulating a declaration of prin
ciples?
The fact is, the Populist United States
Senator from Nebraska, William V. Allen,
manipulated with treacherous intent the
most diabolical conspiracy against the
members of his own political household
that ever disgraced a party organization.
No doubt tbe majority of the delegates
went to St. Louis filled with honest desire
to formulate a platform and nominate a
ticket close upon the line* the party has
adhered to from the beginning, but they
were no match for Bryan's bunco-steerers,
and before they knew it they had parted
with all their party's valuables, and not
only that, but they found themselves
pledged to help the fellow who nad fleeced
them in a game to bunco the whole coun
try.
But the Populists will do nothing of the
kind. They were fooled in convention,
but they will not be fooled at the polls.
While their principles of government are
communistic and antagonistic to what tbe
fathers of the Republic had in mind, it is
nevertheless tree tbat the "middle-of-the
road" Populist is, generally speaking, an
ideal American citizen, barring this one
economic fallacy. As a rule the Populist
is a hard-working man, a frugal man, a
temperate man, a law-observing man, a
determined defender of personal liberty
and a man with whom humanity is his
neighbor. When such a man awakens to
the fact that be has been played upon and
deceived, and his honest efforts made to
mock him. think you he will show no
resentment? Wait and see.
OUR CONVENTION REPORTS.
Early in June The Call dispatched a
corps of staff correspondents to report the
proceedings of the Republican, tbe Demo
cratic, the Populist and the Silver Na
tional conventions. Tbe conventions are
now historical events, but the readers of
The Call are familiar with them all. It
is doubtful if the readers of a newspaper
ever before had such a clear and compre
hensive chronicle of passing happenings,
but nothing less wa9 to be expected of
such a corps of news gatherers. Every
member of it is a graphic writer, bnt what
is more and better is, be knows what news
is and how to communicate it that it may
be the most easily understood.
No doubt the readers of Thk Call ob
served all during tlie time leading up to
and daring the sitting of the several con
ventions that the forecasts of coming events
by our correspondents were marvelouyiy
accurate, so much so indeed tbat the
reader knew in advance what would be
done in convention.
Bat the convention work was not all
that was transmitted to The Call for th*
benefit of its readers. Not only the nomi
nees of the several parties were promptly
interviewed, bat distinguished men from
all parts of the country were persuaded to
give their views upon current questions to
The Call's readers. In fact, not an item
of important news escaped. The several
conventions are now past events, but those
who have preserved files of The Call have
a full and reliable history of perhaps the
most interesting, if not the most critical,
epoch in the*Nation'a life since the foundal
tion of the Government, which could not
be duplicated.
No doubt not a few readers of Tne Call
THE SA3 FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JULY 27. 1896.
wonder how such correct likenesses of
prominent men were obtained. The fact
is The Call sent one of its most thorough
masters of the art of pen and ink por
traiture to. the scenes of action, and among
others Mr. McKinley and Mr. Bryan ac
corded him a private sitting, add tbat is
how The Call eclipsed every other news
paper in the United States in illustration
and portraiture. In this connection it is
well :o remind our readers that the United
Press, which serves Thk Call with cur
rent news, accomplished more in the way
of gathering and transmitting happenings
than the special correspondents of very
many of the metropolitan dailies. No
better service could be rendered, and the
occasion gave the United Press the oppor
tunity to prove that it baa no competitor
worthy of the name.
The Call is a newspaper in the broadest
and fullest meaning of the term, but this
its patrons know, not only from relying
upon it for the news, but by comparison
with TflK Call's contemporaries.
THE GOLD OF CALIFORNIA.
The State of California has poured into
the lap of commerce during the past forty
seven years the enormous sum of over
11.600,000,000 worth of gold. It is still an
nually adding to the wealth of the world
an average output from its mines of pure
gold equal in value to $12,000,000, and the
indications are that it holds within its
bills a stored-up treasure which will en
able it to maintain this average for an in
definite period of time.
The last report issued by the State
Board of Bank Commissioners discloses
the surprising fact that, at tbe time of tbe
report, there wss not to exceed the sum of
twenty-live million dollars in gold coin in
the State of California. There is probably
no more than that amount at the present
time. Where has the gold of California
gone? What have the people to show in
its place? How can the outflow of the
past be checked in the present and future,
so that California may keep her gold at
home?
These are serious questions, ana the
State of California cannot hope to be
permanently prosperous until she has
answered them all. The first two of these
queries fir.d their answer in our past
history. The gold of California began its
outward flow with the very opening of its
mines in 1849. It went eastward with its
returning miners and with the ships
which brought merchandise to tbe new
and undeveloped State.
As the valleys of California were settled
by a pastoral people the gold still went
away to bring them finished products
which they required, but did not produce.
As population increased, this demand
kept pace with it. and up to the present
day California, with all her diversified
productions, bas never been able to secure
and keep the balauceof trade in her favor.
This is why her gold flows out annually
faster than it flows up and in from the
heart of her mountains and mines. There
is another reason fur the outflow of our
California gold. As the industries and
trade agencies of the State bave expanded
great corporations have been formed to
control these enterprises and absorb from
them the utmost o* wealth for their or
ganizers. These corporations found it
expedient to borrow money in their in
fancy for the purpose of accelerating
their growth. The result has been the
creation of a large interest-hearing debt,
due to the East and tbe Old World,
payable, principal and interest, in gold.
The Southern Pacific Kailroad Company
alone, for example, pays annually tne
sum of five millions of dollars in gold as
interest on its bonds held abroad. This
vast out-going stream of gold equals
almost half of the annual gold product of
the California mines. Is it surprising that
of its billion and a half of gold production
our State has but a beggarly one-sixtieth
of that vast sum remaining in its banks
and arteries of trade?
The third query remains to be answered :
How shall California in the present and
future keep her gold at home? There is
but one way possible to accomplish this
result. California must turn the balance
of trade in ber favor. But how? By be
coming a manufacturing State. By chang
ing her immense annual product of raw
materials into finished products within
her own borders, instead of sending them
abroad to be made into finished forms and
returned to her people for their own con
sumption. By encouraging her citizens
to build factories and develop enterprises.
By demanding of the Federal Govern
ment that protection of her industries
which it has accorded to tne Eastern
States when they and their manufacturing
enterprises were young. This is the way
to keep the gold of California at home.
This is the way to bring back tbe wealth
which has flowed out in the years gone by
in adverse balances of trade. This is tbe
paramount problem of business and cf
politics presented this year to the people
of our Golden State.
A GREAT SCHEME.
Nest to putting the country's financial
system upon a greenback basis Populists
deem Government ownership of the rail
way and telegraph lines as the more im
portant. The country has had too much
experience with a greenback basis for a
circulating money medium to entertain a
proposition to return to it, but public
ownership of railway and telegraph lines
has never been tried, and therefore it can
not be said that experience justifies the
rejection of the plan. It would not take
a great deal of common-sense, however, to
convince one that the party that happens
to be in power when the Government
takes possession of the railways and tele
graph would never surrender the Presi
dency and Congress to another party.
With the hundreds of thousands of men
in the direct employ of the railways, and
the hundreds of thousands who make rail
way supplies, having in mind the fact that
their jobs were contingent upon re-electing
the "powers ti-at be," there would be no
use in running an opposition ticket.
Bat it wonld take a good deal of money
to control the railway and telegraph lines
of this country, unless, as has been sug
gested, they be confiscated. The pres
ent capitalisation of the railway and
telegraph companies is over $11,000,
--000,000. Even with the mints wide
open to silver the country would have
to issue bonds to the fuil amoant in
order to pay for the several properties.
The debt of all the nations of the earth
aggregates less than $30,000,000,000 (thirty
billion dollars), and so if we issue bonds
to bny the railways and telegraph oar
public debt would be more than equal to
one-third of the national debt of all the
rest of the world.
Now that Mr. Bryan is the candidate
for President on the Populist ticket, per
haps he would not mind saying whether
or not he is in favor of issuing enough
bonds to buy the railway and telegraph
lines. It is a very important matter, and
his views might be valuable at this time,
lie need not express himself on the ques
tion of returning to the greenback basis
for the Nation's financial system, for
everybody knows that he is quite in
accord with that idea, and he is known to
be one of the original cnarapions of the in
come-tai theory, but he is not on record
concerning the issuing of $11,000,000,000 of
bonds to buy the> railways and telegraph.
COAST EXCHANGES.
The Jackson (Amador County) Republican has
fulfilled its promise of a daily â¢dition, which
made its Initial appearance last Thursday. It
is a model little paper in every respect, hand
some, well arranged and well edited, and It
proudly floats tne banner of McKinl'\ and
Hobaru In his lirst number the edittr -says:
"The object of this paper is to speak si- times
each week, in no uncertain tone, of the vast
resources of Amador County and the bright
future for Jackson and the entire region
through which runs the world-famous 'mother
lode.' We believe that the beginning of a
marvelous development, both in mining and
otner industries, has been inaugurated in this
section of California, and we propose to cast
In our mite and help it aiofig as rapidly as
possible. Should our venture meet with the
approval and patronage ot tiie people of Ama
dor County sufficient to justify the outlay, the
Daily Republican will be enlarged from time to
time in a manner cmnieusurate with the sup
port it receives."
The Lodi Review Budget has changed hands
and comes out with a low brand of politics.
George Shoals, the new editor and proprietor,
formerly conducted a Democratic paper in
South Dakota. He has tacked the Bryan-Sewall
colors to his mast in the Lodi publication.
It is opined that the town of Saa Bernardino
is a very profi table journalistic field judging
from appearances. The SUB of that place in
forms us that "a Populist paper was recently
launched there and that it is a settled fact that
a local mining journal will shortly make its
appearance. More than thip. It Is said there
are to be two new dallies, one Republican and
the other Democratic. In fact, Urn air lately
has been full of newspaper talk. It has been
even said that some of the established Jour
nals were to change hands, several local capi
talists who had once been engaged in news
paper work in this city contemplating a profit
able investment."
Yolo County has a new weekly paper, the
Winters Independent, edited by B. J. Waugh.
It makes a very respectable appearance and
proclaims its mission to be to acquaint the
world at large more fully with the resources
of the productive country around Winters and
to do battie for the cause of free silver.
L. W. Allum, who for the psst three years
has been city editor ol the Riverside 'Daily
Prett, has vacated that position and will be
succeeded by A. F. Clarke, one of the proprie
tors of the paper, who has hitherto been en
gaged in editing the Ontario Record, which he
and his brother owned and have just sold.
Mr. Allum purposes to start a new morning
Republican paper in Riverside about August
15, to be called the News.
There is rejoicing in Ventura over the grati*
fying news that all the formidable obstacles in
the way of the proposed Ojal Valley Railroad
have been removed, and that the enterprise
will be pushed forward with all possible speed.
The Ventura Weekly Democrat says of the pro
jected line, whien will make Ventura the mar
ket of the fertile valley of the OJai: "The
$10,000 required of our citizens in cash and
right of way is practically provided tor. The
liberality of our citizens generally makes a
creditable showing, and it is safe to predict
that not one of those who have made the Ojai
Valley Railroad possitle will regret the part
tbey took in promoting it by means of cash or
accessions in the matter of right of way. The
right of way, with the exception of a few
short gaps, has been secured, and these few
property -holders will assuredly be reasonable
and not retard the progress of the project by
exorbitant demands. We are authorised to
announce that the building of the road is now
a certainty, and its corns truction â will be com
menced by Captain Cross as soon as a few
minor details are arrangedâ probably not later
than September 1."
The Redding Free Prer* furnishes a timely
object lesson in the article which follows:
"The news tbat the Shasta Lumber Company
will start up will bÂ« received with gladness by
the people ot Round Mountain and Montgom
ery Creek. William Hers, who was here Satur
day, says that the settler:- have been having a
hard time to make both ends meet, and the
starting up of this enterprise not only fur
nishes employment, but gives a home market
for produce which the settlers raise. As
Major McKinley says, what the people need is
some gaiufnl occupation to make them happy
and prosperous. Protection is a greater issue
aud more reaching in its effects than the free
coinage of silver. Manufacturing enterprises
in Shasta County make a market for labor and
a market for the products of the farm and or
chard. What we n*?d is not more money, but
the circulation of the money now held in
bank. A demand for lumber makes the in
vestment of idle capital in the lumber fields
productive 0/ returns to the capitalist and cir
culates money among the people. These 125
men who will be employed by the company
will scatter money all through the county. It
is the policy of the Republican party to restore
conndence by passing those laws which pro
tect American products and furnish gainful
employment What has made the lumber
trade so dull is the removal of the tariff by a
Democratic administration on Canadian lum
ber, bringing the lumber product of a foreign
country into competition with ourown lumber
and creating a stagnation of the lumber
trade."
Ex-Judge Hastie of Clayton, Contra Costa
County, while digging for water last week dug
into a promising coal prospect, and a corre
spondent of the Martinez Gazette thus refers to
the discovery : it is in hard sand rock and on
the water level, but not enough work has been
done to prove iv value. There is a chance for
home capitalists to come in and develop li if
they want to, for the Judge lacks the necessary
means. There is on top of the supposed vein
ten feet of solid ground, with quarts boulders
weighing from one to 2,000 pounds each, and
it takes both time and money to move them;
but everybody hopes ths Judge will succeed in
getting to the coal as soon as possible,for it will
benefit his neighbors as well as himself more
and more as the work progresses.
The town of Riverside has nearly completed
its new electric-light works and the Reflex
states tbat arc lights, for which the town has
been paying $15, will now cost only $4 50
each, while a sixteen-caadle power Incandes
cent lamp will cost three-quarters of a cent an
hour. "So you can put in as many lamps as
you want all over your house, and if you burn
say three lamps three hours on the average,
which is about right for the average family,
your lights will cost you only f2 10 per
month."
The new mining town of Mojav* on the
desert of that name already has a sprightly
newspaper, the Pick and Pan. It declares that
"what Leadville has been, what Cripple Creek
is Mojave may become if the energies, intelli
gence and ambition of her citizens are pushed
in the right direction."
It calls upon the citizens of Mojave to bestir
themselves and "set the example of a hustling,
bustling community, which in times of busi
ness depression did not alt still and wait for
legislation, tariff or silver, to put us on our
feet, but just went right ahead regardless of
the ill-omened talk of the croaker, who is ever
with us, and nnatched the wealth of victory
from the reluctant grasp of tnÂ« desert."
The paper remarks that it will "use its pick
to unearth the nuggets of news from tbe sand
and debris of the desert and camp, and its pan
for the purpose of separating the dirt from the
yellow metal, and leaving as its residuum
nothing but grains of gold."

on whom he gazed. But that was not the only

flashed and flittered sparkling diamonds set
in gold buttons formed by large block letters

Clasped upon a white bow tie was a diamond

as if doubly to assure any over-cautious bunko

Mr. Kellner's name also appears upon the

FROM McKINLEY'S SPEECHES.
The American people , hold the financial
honor of our Government as sacred as our flag,
Sfm-.^ *? Â°Pon to guard it with the
tame sleepless vigilance. â¢
Our creed embraces an honest dollar, an un
tarnished National credit, adequate revenues
forthe uses of the Government, protection to
laDorand industry, preservation of the home
market and reciprocity which will extend our
foreign marsets.
Our trouble is not with the character of the
money that we have, but with the threat to de
base it. We have the same currency that we
had in 1892, good the world over, and unques
tioned by any people. Then, too, we had un
exampled credit and prosperity.
Not content with the Inauguration of the
ruinous policy which has brought down the
wages of the laborer and the price of farm
products, its advocates now offer a new policy
which will diminish the value of money in
which wages and prices are paid.
What we want is a sound policy, financial
and industrial, which will give courage and
confidence to all, for when that is done the
money now unemployed, because of fear for
the future and lack of conndence in invest
ment, will quickly appear in the channels of
trade.
The money of the United States, and every
kind and form of it, whether of paper, silver
or gold, must be as good as the best in the
world. It must not only be current at its full
lace value at home, but it must be counted at
par in any and every commercial center of the
globe.
The employment of the idle money we al
ready have in gainful Dursnits will put every
idle man in the country at work, and when
there is work there is wsges, and when there
are work and wages there are consumers who
constitute the best market ior the product of
our soil. â¢
The piatform adopted by the Republican Na
tional Convention has received my careful
consideration, and has my unqualified appro
val. It is a matter of gratification to me, as I
am sure it must be to you and Republicans
everywhere and to all our people, that the ex
pressions of its declaration of principles are so
direct, clear and emphatic. They are too plain
and positive to leave any chance for doubt or
question as to their purport and meaning.
Recent events have imposed upon the patri
otic people of this country a responsibility and
a duty greater than any since the Civil War.
Then it was a struggle to preserve the Govern
ment of the United States; now it is a struggle
to preserve the financial honor of the Govern
ment of the United States. Then it was a con
test to save the Union ; now it is a contest to
save spotless its credit. Then section was ar
rayed against section; now men of all sections
can unite, and will unite, to rebuke the repudi
ation of our obligations and the debasement of
our currency.
ELECTIONS THIS FALL.
Elections will be held in six States before
the grand battle of ballots is joined on Tues
day, November 3. These States and the order
in which they will vote are as follows : Ala
bama will elect a full State ticket in August;
Vermont, Arkansas and Maine will vote for a
Governor September 1, 7 and 14 respectively;
Florida and Georgia vote for Governor in Oc
tober, and then there will be a lull until No
vember. There seems to be no doubt that
Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Florida will
go Democratic, while it is equally safe to pre
dict that Vermont and Maine will go Repub
lican, probably by increased majorities- Louisi
ana, Rhode Island and Oregon have already
held elections this year.
Louisiana went Democratic by a decreased
majority; Rhode Island increased its Repub
lican majority, while the vote on the Con
gressional ticket in Oregon -was very close, the
two Republicans getting the returns-by an ag
gregate plurality ot only 600 or 700. At the
November election, besides the Presidential
electors. Governors will be chosen in the fol
lowing States: Colorado, Connecticut, Dela
ware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massa
chusetts. Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Mis
souri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York,
North Carolina, North Dakota, South Carolina,
couth Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington,
West Virginia and Wisconsin. For the first
time Utah will vote as a State, and the elec
toral vote of the United States is increased to
447, making the number necessary to a choice
in the Electoral College 224.

The British ship Star of France which

a floating chicken ranch. The poultry
consists of one motherly old hen and a

notwithstanding their fateful number,
have brought no bad luck to the vessel â
the rule probably goes contrary in the

them roost on the spare booms lying along
the deck, but as they grew larger she led
them higher, and their sleeping place was
in the lower rigging. In all the rough
weather, with the ship pitching from wave
to wave, not a chicken was lost overboard.
Often they were disturbed and scared
down on deck when the sailors climbed
hurriedly up the rigging to struggle with
the gale-rilled canvas aloft, bat they re
turned to ttieir swaying roost.
That old hen is a true warlike British
Amazon. She sits on tne ship's rail and
watches the docks with a savage eye.
Whenever a Brannan-street pullet ven
tures down on the wharf in search of a
meal she springs off her perch and
charges the intruder. If a number come
down instead of one she battles with them
all the same. Sne is no respecter of the
lordly male and will fly with savage
squawks at a rooster as quickly as at a
fowl of her own sex.
Often after she has cleared the dock she
will go aboard the ship and whip some of
her own c ildren, so thoroughly does the
fighting spirit take possession of her. No
cat, dog or bird can live on that vessel,
and even the pis in his pen forward is only
safe from her furious attacks because she
can't get at him.
The bark Albert, the first vessel of the
island sugar fleet which sailed for this
por: about the Ist, came in yesterday
morning twenty-six duys out. She left
Honolulu in company with the S. N.
Castle and the ship J. C. Glade, but out
sailed them. The schooner Transit and
bark S. C. Alien from the islands are both
twenty-eight days out and the barkentina
S. G. Wilder nineteen days.
On Juiy 22, in latitude 33 north and
longitude 134 degrees 30 minutes west, tne
Albert sighted the schooner Martha Tufts,
48 days out from Tres Marias, Mexico.
She had met with calms and unfavorable
weather, and, in consequence of the length
of time at sea, was out of provisions and
in distress. Captain Griffiths supplied the
hungry crew with food, and the vessels
parted company, the schooner bearing
away to her port, 600 miles distant.
The schooner Cbecto sailed yester
day morning for Pigeon Point for a
load of damaged freight from the stranded
steamer Colombia. It is thought that
those engaged in getting the ship's cargo
will find their venture a profitable one, as
the weather is favorable for the work of
completely emptying the bull and much
of the cargo is not easily damaged by
water.
The Chinaman sicK with varioloid at the
quarantine station on Angel Island is re

ease have appeared.
A number of excursionists went out to
the battle-ship Oregon yesterday, but were
not permitted to go aboard, as the crew
-were busy working with the torpedoes,
and the presence of visitors was not desir
able at that time. Commodore Howison,
however, will throw the ship open to the
public next Sunday if she is in the harbor.

BURGLARS FROM SUISUN
E. G. Wright and C. Hinds
Cleverly Captured by Po*
liceman Ryan.
They Were Trying to Dispose of Their
Piunder to a Pawnbroker on
Third Street
Two burelars from the interior were
cleverly captured by Policeman T. L. Ryan
on Saturday afternoon at Third and
Market streets.
The police had been notified that the resi
dence of Mrs. Josephine Davis of Suisun,
Solano County, was entered by burglars
last Tuesday night and a larze quantity of
silverware and other articles were stolen.
It was expected that the burglars would
make their way to this City to dispose of
the plunder.
Ryan was on special duty, and Satur
day afternoon he dropped into the pawn
shop ol Andrew Coleman, 41 Third street.
Two men were there at the time trying to
dispose of some silverware, which they
bad in a telescope basket. Ryan's sus
picions were aroused and he asked the
men where they got the silverware. They
gave him an evasive answer and hurriedly
left the store.
Ryan followed them, and at Third and
Market streets placed them under arrest
and took them to the City Prison. On ex
amining the contents of the basket, Ryan
discovered a pawn ticket for a poid watch
and chain ai.d a diamond ring in tbe name
of Josephine L>avi.Â«, dated in April last.
This gave him a clew and he accused the
men of committing the burglary at Mrs.
Davis' house at Suisun, but they stoutly
denied it. The men gave the "names of
Edward G. Wright and Cortis Hinds, and
their occupation as laborers. They are
both young men.
The Sheriff of Solano County was notified
of their arrest, and yesterday morning
Constable Kinloch arrived with a Justice's
warrant, charging the men with burglary.
They were booked en route to Suisun, and
last night Constable Kinloch left with
them.

BEATEN BY OVEE-CONFIDENCE.
Attempts to Dispose of Four Dozens
After Eating an Ordinary
Meal-
An egg famine has been averted. The
man who can at one sitting dispose of the
product of the combined labor of fifty
hens for one day, or one ben for fifty days,
! is vanquished. His fame as a gastronomic
wonder will no longer bear tbe light of an
{ X-ray inspection.
George Parsons is a teleeraph operator,
and a good one, bat it is not as a juggler with
electricity that he has won the plaudits of
the multitude. Parsons' "strong holt" is ;
a well-developed appetite and a fondness
for egps. He eats eggs three times a
dayâ boiled eggs, fried eggs, scrambled
epgs and eggnog; eegs of the hen, the
duck, tne goose, the ostrich or the turtle â
anything that wears a shell and is not so
stale as to provoke unfavorable comment
It is said of this gourmand that be has
but onp "square" meal a week, and that
on payday. He has been known to fre
qeotlv enter a restaurant and call for two
dozen fried eges. At first the waiters
would look at Parsons with tears in their
eyes, but now they are accustomed to his
strange order and are not offended if he
abuses them for failing to select the
largest fruit ol the fowly ard. The annihila
tor of eggs goes into those two dozen as a
terrier would into a cageful of rats. Oc
casionally he stops to eat a bun or drink a
cup of coffee.
When the victuals or his exchequer are
eibausted he leaves the place reluctantly
and hies away to curb his charging appe
tite until the next meal hour arrives.
Often after one of these meals â ordinary
to him, but death by torture to a common
man â he mounts a bicycle and rides a
distance of thirty or forty miles into the
country to "settle his stomach," and the
bent at tbe end of the route he chooses
are forced to work overtime for the next
week or two to regulate the supply and
demand. IM-1 , Â
Napoleon met his Waterloo; Marc An
tony fell before the wiles of Cleopatra:
Mayor Sutro has his Broderick to contend
with and George Parsons went up against
too many eggs. He was the victim of
over-confidence. Having prepared for the
fray by imbibing sundry potions of
"steam" and disposing ot an order of pork
and beans, sufficient in itself for a street
sweeper, he attempted to partake of four
dosen fried eggs on a wager. It was the
error of his lifeâ the BharKey that ended
his champiousnip.
The match was made in the little Ger.
man restaurant on Geary street, near
Kearny, on Saturday night. Several hours
previously Parsons had dined heartily.
The gnawing of hunger led him restau
rantward once more, and, accompanied Dy
friends, he sat down to partake of a goodly
quantity of pork and beans, with buns,
coffee and other accessories. These dis
posed of, and his yearning yet unsated, he
negotiated a bet with bis companions. The
terms were tbat he should eat forty-eight
fried eggs within thirty minutes, being al
lowed a two minutes' breathing spell be
tween each dozen. If he succeeded, the
others were to pay for the meal and a week's
board for the victor; if he lost, the matter
of settling with the cashier devolved upon
himself.
Four dozen of the largest eggs on hand
were selected and, without delay, the
gourmet began his task. He was still
hungry when the first dozen disappeared.
Tbe second twelve faded away as mist be
fore a July sun. As tbe start was made
on the second half of the consignment,
those who had wagered their money
aeainst his appetite wanted to hedge.
They appeared grieved and melancholy,
like tbe backers of Ida Saver at the old
Bay District track.
Laattuing to scorn their talk of compro
mise Parsons started after the third dozen.
Seeminely he still wÂ»s hungry. He had
got to the thirty-third etsg, when suddenly
his grin died away. Swallowing became
difficult, and even the drinking of two
cupfuls of coffee did not alleviate his dis
tress. The champion, seeing defeat at
hand, put on a bold front in the hope that
the other bettors would again seek to
hedge; but they had watched the craning
of his tfeck and bulging of his eyes orer
the last egg and were gloating silently.
The thirty-fifth egg went tbe way of its
predecessors, and then Parsons leaned
back in nis chair and solemnly announced:
"I quit you-"
A yell of delight went up from the spec
tators. It was the exuiting shout of
Envy's triumph. The king ot egg-eaters
was dethroned, and by a plate of pork and
beans.
Failure cost the egÂ»-eater $2 40â the
price of his meal. Like Corbett, he admits
that he underrated his task, and intends
to try again. He is likely to win.
FRENCH CHARITY.
Generous Distribution of tbe Proceeds
of ths Recent Celebration of
the Fall of the Bastile.
The finance committee of the 14th of
July celebration, composed of P. A. Ber
gerot, J. Lambla and John Bayle, sub
mitted its report last night at tbe meeting
of tbe general committee of the financial
operations of the celebration. The report
shows that the' total gate receipts amounted
to $29j1 49 and that tbe expenses were
$1092, leaving a balance on hand of
$1899 49. It was decided to reserve $149 49
of the net proceeds for next year's cele
bration and to distribute tbe remainder to
Tarious charitable organizations, as fol
lows: To the French Ladies' Benevolent
Society, $1000; to the invalids' relief fund
of the French Hospital Society, $300; to
the Alliance Francaise for the support of
French classes in the public schools, $200;
to the indigent French at the Almshouse, â¢
$100; to the widows' and orphans' police
fund, $JOO, and to the Union Chretienne, a
relief society, $50.
A vote of tnanks was next adopted in
favor of Mme. C. Fischter for having sung
"The Star-spangled Banner" and to E. J.
Dupuy and Professor E. Knowlton for
having pronounced the French and Ameri
can orations respectively.
The eeneral committee then adjourned
sine die, after having elected the follow
ing committee to take charge of the next
year's celebration: S. Weill, P. A. Ber

The Quartermaster -General of the
Army Will Retire To-Dayâ Ap.
plicants for the Place.
It has been derided that seven com
panies of the First United States Infantry,
under Colonel Shafter, shall go to Santa
Cruz for a practice march and camp of in
struction in field exercises.
Last Wednesday Captain Charles G.
Starr, Company F, and Lieutenant Sydney
A. Clomau, Company Â£, started in an am
bulance for Santa Cruz. They have gone
in advance to select a site for the camp
and grounds for the maneuvers.
Four companies of the regiment are at
Angel Island and three at Benicia bar
racks. They will leave San Francisco Au
gust 10 for Santa Cruz and will remain
there until the middle of September. The
troops will march to Santa Cruz via San
Mateo. Belmont, Redwood City, Los Gatos
and thence over the mountains to the sea.
An army retiring board has been ap
pointed to'meet at Chicago. August 10, or
as soon thereafter as practicable, for the
examination of such officers as may be
ordered before it. Detail: Major-General
Wes:ey Merritt, Brigadier-General John
K. Brooke. Colonel James F. Wade, Fifth
Cavairy; Lieutenant-Colonel William H.
Forwood, D. 8. G. ; Major Calvin de Witt,
smrceon; Lieutenant-t'oionel W. Clous,
D. J. A. G., recorder.
Major J. A. Darling, Fifth Artillery, has
been ordered to report in person to the
president of the retiring board in Chicago.
Colonel Crofton of the Fifth Infantry
has determined to contest the authority
of the board to retire him. Army officers
generally entertain the opinion that the
colonel has made a mistake of judgment
iv forming this decision.
R, N. Batchelder, quartermaster-general
of the army, retires to-day. General
Batchelder entered the volunteer service
early in the Civil War, and displayed so
much ability as a quartermaster that he
was promoted and commissioned in the
regular army.
While stationed in this department he
planned and executed many improve
ments at the Presidio reservation. Men
who did not give him credit for unselfish
motives started the report that he was
largely interested in San Francisco real
estate adjacent to the reservation. The
report waa accepted as correct, so when
General Batcbelder was in this City a few
weeks ago be was asked about his real
estate holdings here. He replied that he
never had any property interests in San
Francisco. He will probably make his
home henceforth in. or near Washington,
where be has acquired some real estate
and made other investments.
General Batchelder's successor, it is
thought, will be Colonel C. G. Sawtelle, the
ranking colonel, although the latter will
retire May 10. 1898. Colonel M. U Lud
ington is the second ranking colonel on
the list ana as he will not attain the age
of retirement until July 4, 1903, it is
fancied that the President may yet decide
to give him the preference. Colonel G. H.
Weeks, who retires February 3, 1898, and
Colonel Moore, who will not retire until
October 26, 1901, are applicants for the
position.
A general court martial convened at the
camp of the Light Artillery Battalion,
Santa Cruz, last week for the trial of
Private Benjamin A. Barlow, Battery D.
The followine officers constitute the court:
Captain Charles Morris, Captain Frank
Thorp, Captain Euclid B. Frick, assistant
surgeon; First Lieutenant Wilrnot E.
Ellis and Second Lieutenants William G.
Harm, Thomas W. Marston, Louis R.
Burgess, Charles P. Summerall and
George G. Gately. The last named is
judge advocate.
The order appointing the court contains
this paragraph: "The trial of the case
being necessary for the Bake of immediate
example the court will sit without regard
to hours."
Leive of absence for ten days has been
granted to First Lieutenant W. W. Gal
braith, adjutant Fifth Artillery.
Furloughs have been granted to Thomas
Powell, Battery E, Fifth Artillery; Cor
poral Charles W. Holliday, Troop D,
Fourth Cavairy ; Corporal Charles Morri
son and Alban Daumler, Battery L, Fif :tx

"The Spirit Helpeth Oar Infirmities,
but Who Can Bear a Wounded
Spirit?."
The aristocratic neighborhood of Clay
street and Van Ness avenue was yesterday
the scene of one of the most solemn and
impressive funerals ever witnessed in San
Francisco. More than two hundred of the
most prominent men and women of the
City gathered at the Stetson residence,
1801 Van Ness avenue, at 1 o'clock, to pay
their respects to the family of the late
Albert L. Stetson and offer their tributes
of loving remembrance to him that lay
asleep in death beneath countless wreaths
and tender little immortelles.
The conspicuous feature about the as
sembly was the preponderance of eminent
citizens â men whose names and achieve
ments are known wherever the fame of
the State has spread. The services were
simple and beautiful, marked by a gener
ous catholicity of sentiment that appealed
with touching power to all who heard the
words of comfort that fell from the pas
tor's lips.
Promptly at 12 :30 the doors of the resi
dence were opened to the family's friends,
and shortly thereafter a number had as
sembled in the parlors, library and spa
cious hallway. At 1 o'clock the services
began with singing, the choir being sta
tioned in the back parlor adjoining the
front room, where lay the body of the un
fortunate dead.
The choir sang softly, "Nearer, My God,
to Thee,' ' and the words sounded strangely
plain in the silence of the bereaved house
hold. As the theme rose in melody the i
eyes of strong men were fiiled with tears.
The son? done, Rev. Robert Mackenzie
read a cnapter from Proverbs.
Then there was another song. This time
Cardinal Newman's immortal creation,
"Lead, Kindly Light." It was now time
for the words Over the dead. Gently the
silver-haired minister stepped into the
hallway and began: "Friends, how strik
ing at this solemn moment are the words
of God found in Proverbs, 'The Spirit
Helpeth Oar Infirmities,' and the qfues
tion that follows close, 'But Who Can Bear
a Wounded Spirit?' There is great wisdom,
great food for thought in these words."
The speaker's manner was quiet, im
pressive and conversational, fie cited ex
amples from the lives of men to illustrate
the words of the text.
"We have all seen the case!of some'poor
cripple," be said, "chained in a diseased
and deformed body, harassed by cares and
racked by pain, yet living on and on to
old age, refusing to surrender. "Why?
Some people say because he has a strong
will. Ad, truly, this only means that he
has a spirit that helpeth his infirmities, a
dauntless spirit. But if the spirit is
stricken by invisible shafts, as by storms
and thunderbolts, what then? If tne cita
del is stormed by unseen forces, what
then? Who Knows what battles are fought
in another man's heart? Who knows why
the wounded giant falters? What man
shall judge of his brother, or woo can look
into another's soul and say what conflicts
are rasing on the battlefield there?
"The longer I live the more just and
beautiful it seeme to me that God has re
served the power of judging of human
conduct, and that we are not to pass sen
tence on our fellow-men.
"This moment we are in the presence of
a great bereavement. We have gathered
as friends and neighbors to sympathize
with a family that stands higb, a family
\ghose members have often consoled others
in the hour of sorrow. I offer them yoar
sympathy, but 1 ask that all of us, as we
step softly in the presence of the dead,
take unto ourselves the solemn lesson of
this deep mystery enfolded in another's
death. Let us properly read the lessons of

Theie were many brothers from t-an Pedro and

Found the Workmen of San Diegj fully alive,

"Your deputy, Brother Stelner, is doing good
work, and Brother Matlgley is a nost in himself.
To him is due much of the life of Point Loma. The
brothers of San Diego chartered a special train
and went 10 El Cajon Valley, where the officers of
the lodge were installed. We bad the pleasure of
witnessing the initiation of three candidates by
the amp.ified form and screen work, tbe officers
<>f Point Loma officiating and furnishing the para
phernalia, doing the work In a very creditable
manner in a darkened room. From the interest
and enthusiasm manifested by the brothers of San
Diego and this little valley, 1 look for abundant
results this year, and I feel encouraged and repaid
for this trip lo >an DiÂ»go. Last Monday I as
sisted to install the officers of Citrus LodÂ«e,

ATTORNEY QUITZOW'S DEFENSE
Denounces the Charges Against Him
as Blackmail and Promises
a Vindication.
At the Good Citizenship meeting held
yesterday afternoon at Metropolitan Tem
ple Chairman Quitzow spoke briefly in
reference to the charges that have been
recently brought against nim of swindling
a client. In his opening remarks Chair
man Quitzow said:
"I wish to say a few words on a subject
that hardly merits notice as far as I am
concerned, but as you may be curious to
know my version of the matter I will
briefly statÂ«:
"That an obscure sheet called the Moni
tor promised last week to publish 'Quit
zow's Record,' and having promised it
had to produce something.
"On Friday last the Monitor's posters
displayed on the street corners had this
printed upon them in bold type: 'Quit
zow the Pure. A client claims $8000.
Swindle extraordinary.'
"The Monitor of the 25t,h inst. (this
week) comes out in a slanderous attack
upon my clothes and good hat, which
were not injured, and then pr nts in full a
complaint which was drawn for tbe pur
pose of publication in t at unclean sheet
to revive its waning finances.
"A suit, of which this is a repetition,
came regularly on for trial in the Superior
Court. Clune or his counsel failing to ap
pear the evidence in my deiense was heard
by the Judge in open court, and upon that
evidence judgment was rendered in my
favor and which stands recorded on the
28th day of April, 1896.
"The bringing ud anew of this same
case, and the former one, is merely an at
tempt at blackmail.
"You can rest assured that I will meet
all ana any legal proceedings brought
regularly against me in the proper man
ner, and I can assure you in advance that
I will be completely* vindicated in the
courts of our State."
Rev. Ray Palmer was then introduced
and announced that he would speak upon
the subject, "The Ot>en Ques ion, or Who
Built the Temple of Liberty ?"
"It seems to me," began the speaker,
"that any one who cannot understand the
aims of our society must be wrong in thÂ«
upper story. 1 do not see how anybody
can fail to see the difference between
Americanism and Romanism. Romanism
is lixe an old battered sailstiip, towed by
a tug of a Pope from beyond tbe sea.
Americanism is a mighty steamship
plowing boldly through the waters of
the sea.
"But who built the temple of liberty?
I beg of you that you will be patient
while I go into history to answer this
question. CÂ«rdinal Gibbons says that
every man has a right to worship in ac
cordance with a rijjht conscience. The
Roman church denies to the individual
the right to determine what is a 'right'
conscience. Romanism does not say that
a man shall worship God according to the
dictates of his own conscience, but in ac
cordance with what the Pupe of Rome
shall pronounce to be a 'right' conscience.
"So you see that beneath these words of
Cardinal Gibbons, seemingly so accord
ant with the principles of liberty, are
really far other than they seem. Beneath
the smooth and apparently harmless
words are the hiss and sting of the Mr
pent"
The speaker cited at length instances of
Catholic persecution of Protestantism, de
claring that these instances typefied what
Cardinal Gibbons called a "right con
science." Rev. Palmer then proceeded
with a refutation of a statement made by
various Catholic prelates that religious
toleration in this country was first shown
by a Catholic, Lord Baltimore. "Even ad
mitting that Lord Baltimore was naturally
tolerant, nevertheless by the terms of bis
charter, granted by King Charles, he was
compelled to observe tolerance. The
Protestant ascension to power in England
compelled the trembling Catholics of
Maryland to grant toleration after seven
teen years ot persecution.
"I prÂ»y," concluded the speaker, "that
this Government shall never fall into the
hands of the Pope of Rume. I fear that if
it does, it will never be able to get out of
his hands attain. I urge you, therefore, to
be wakeful and alert to protect unsullied
our American institutions.
"1 am not discouraged at the work we
have accomplished in t. is country. It is
amusing to hear Father Yorke count the
A. P. As. in this country. We have ac
complished much. ItwaÂ«none others but
the A. P..A. that sent Satolli out of this
country. We have made it hot for the
Romanists in this country.
"The Catholics in this City aver that
they hays an American championing their
cause. Very well, as long as he behaves
himself as an American, out if he dares to
lay his hands on our public school system
we will see that ne is sent to Halifax or
some other place where he belongs. Our
order is strong â stronger than it seems.
Many of our sympathizers will vote
with us and work with us, but will not
join our order for fear of sufferinc; finan
cially for it. We, of the American Pro
tective Association declare, aud declare
confidently, that Romanism's sun is about
to set, never to rise again."
Next Sunday afternoon Rev. Ray Painaer
will deliver his final lecture in this City
before leaving for the East. The subject
upon which he will speak was announced
yesterday as "Roger Williams Opening
the Gates of Liberty."

I ' The arrow flies with '.hÂ» wind. The top figures
1 at station indicate maximum temperature for the
i days: those underneath It, If any, the amount of
j rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth*,
during the past twelve hour*. Isobars, or solid
lint's, connect pains of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hlKh" means high barometric pressure and
Is- usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to . low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rain*.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south alone the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the'"low" Is inclosed' with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "hUh" In the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition!
mill produce an opposite result.

LOST TO SIGHT,

Went to the St. Louis
Convention.
NONE LEFT TO RATIFY.
Great Interest Shown in the
Future Movements of Frank
J. Moifitt
QUICKLY THE FIRE DIED OUT.
But the Dispay of Republicanism
at the Tabernacle Went to
People's Hearts.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 26. Â»
The Populists and Democrats and the
Silver party of Alameda County are
directing their attention just now to the
homecoming of Frank J. Motfitt. A year
ago when the ex-Senator gave up his
Democratic newspaper and. retired from
the surface of politics it was predicted
that he would rise again at the head of
some other combination, which was not
at that time foreseen by the curbstone
politicians. But Frank Moffitt saw it.
The man who could command the services
of a special Southern Pacific locomotive at
midnight to fly to Altamont and do that
which eventually unseated S. G. Hiiborn
in Congress could see farther than his
neighbors, and the dispatches received
during the past two days have conclusively
proved the truth of the prediction.
Frank Moffltt will return to Oakland in
a few days and everybody is wondering
what he will do.
That he will not be idle is a foregone
conclusion to all who know the tireless ac
tivity of the man. He has always been a
Democrat, and about two years ago he
commenced the advocacy of free silver.
He is one of the committee appointed by
the Bimetallic Convention to convey the
news of its indorsement of the Demo
cratic candidate to Mr. Bryan, and it is
safe to say that he will not confine his
' mission to the business delegated by the
convention. Frank Moffitt is sanguine.
Sanguineness is his life, and he believes
he has already helped to elect the next
President. He has graduated from the
school of petty politics that dominate a
town election or even a question of State
policy and has taken his stand among
National politicians.
The dispatches from St. Louis have
made frequent mention of the man from
Oakland, and Dr. Woolsey led the march
in the convention hall when Bryan's in
dorsement was announced. Should the
impossible happen and Mr. Bryan be Mr.
Cleveland's successor there will be a lot
of patronage to be dispensed, and it is
sale to say that Mr. Daggeit and Mr.
Irish will not have much to say about the
apportionment.
In such an event W. "W. Foote, Bill
English and Frank Moffitt would be
elevated to a position for which they have
already built a solid foundation.
It is safe to say that the ex-Senator will
at once commence to solidify all the dis
gruntled elements in politics so that a
respectable Bryan vote shall be returned
from Alameda County. At present there
is not a Democratic or Populist organ on
this side of the bay with the exception of
one weekly, and so it is not unlikely that
the ex-editor will again get into harness,
and that Athens will howl.
"We have all been sold," said a Populist
office-holder in this county this morning.
"If Bryan should be elected, what wonld
the Populists get? Our old friends, Foote,
Moffitt and English would try to be as
generous as possible, but with such a
horde of hungry Democrats to feed, they
could only have apologies and regrets left
for us, and then we should surely get in a
greater ratio than 16 to 1."
Rev. Dr. Wendte is pastor o* the church
of which John P. Irish is a trustee. Dr.
Wendta is an observant man, and he is
also an advocate of a sound money
standard. He has been called "a Christian
who believes in one God, and 100 cents
(not 53) in tne dollar." "And that is
what I am," said the doctor yesterday.
One of his friends, Adna D. Dennison, a
leading Populist of tMs city, asked thÂ«
doctor how the silver fight looked. "To
tell thÂ« truth," replied Dr. Wendte, "you
are the first free-silver man that I have
seen since I left Oakland."'
Two weeks have gone by since the Dem
ocrats nominated the boy orator, who is
38 years old, for President, and yet the
Democrats of Alameda County have not
ratified. If there be any Democrats at
all in this county they certainly have done
nothing to show their appreciation of the
convention that would foist upon the
country another four years of maladmin
istration infinitely worse than the last.
The only reasonable inference is that all
the Democrats have either enlisted under
the banner of protection or have left the
district. As the only Democrats known to
be abroad are W, W. Foote, Dr. Woolsey
and ex-Senator Moffitt, it seems reasonable
conclusion that they are the Democracy of
A'ameda County. Had these gentlemen
been at home there would cerjtainly have
been a band-wagon and a transparency and
some red fire and speeches long before
this, and such tactics would have brought
out a crowd and the air would have been
full of enthusiasm. This is a peculiarity
of Alameda County. The air is full of De
mocracy and the streets of Democrats, but
the election returns always make it ap
pear that they emigrate on the eve of elec
tion day. â¢
The preceding paragraph cannot but
point out a most pertinent moral to the
Republicans of Alameda County â the
need, the demand for harmony. Although
a pronounced Republican county it is a fact
that to-day ths majority of office-holders
are freak politicians. They have taken
advantage of prevailing discontent in Re
publican ranks and have slipped in un
awares because the party vote was hope
lessly divided. Although the probability
of harmony on matters purely local is not
particularly roseate, it is encouraging to
note that there is a marked evidence ot
unanimity regarding the necessity of pro
tection and of working for its standard
bearer. The letting off of Democratic
and Populist fireworks during the past
few days has subsided just as fast as the
rocket sticks fell, but the patriotism,
the figures, the facts, the manhood
displayed at the Tabernaclo on the
night of the great Republican
ratification meeting still live- The
argument made that night by W. ft.
Davis was like a seed dropped on. fertile
ground. It is sending forth shoots on
every street corner, and when the votes
are counted it will bÂ« seen that however
much fireside matters may rend the party
in this county on the great issue of
protection Aiamedans are united.

PETITIONS FILED EARLY.
Objections to the Estimated Values of
the City Assessor.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 26.â The street
car companies are taking time by the fore
lock ana presenting their petitions for a
reduction of assessments to the City Clerk
before the City Assessor has turned his
books over to that official. Yesterday the
Oakland Consolidated and the Alameda,
Oakland and Piedmont electric lines pre
sented their petitions and had them filed.
The assessments are the same as those
made by the County Assessor on each
line- The tracks, poles, road and road
bed of the Consolidated from Second
street to the northerly line of the city are
placed at $23,225. whereas the company
only asks $8087 for them. The franchise
is placed at $25,000, while the company
holds it at $4000.
On the Sixteenth-street branch the com
pany asks for a reduction of from $11,000
to $5585 and on toe franchise from $5000 to
$1000.
The Eighth-street branch is assessed for
$16,650 and the franchise at $10,000. The
company asKs a reduction to $7524 and
$3000 respectively.
The aosessment upon the Alameda, Oak
land and Piedmont Company's track,
poles, road and roadbed in Oakland is
placed at $43,450. The company wants ii
reduced to $20,481. Several franchises
cover the right of way, whicn are assessed
separately, aggregating $35,000, which the
company wants placed at $9500. The
franchise covering one-half of the Webster
street bridges is placed at an additional
$1000, but the company thinks it should
not be over $500.
PHILIPPIC ON GAMBLING
Police, Like Ministers and Their
Deacons, Should Not Lounge
About Salcons.
Rev. F. D. Bovard Is Doubtfnl If the
Chief of Police Would Bb on His
Side in Suppressing Gambling.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 26.â Rev. F. D.
Bovard delivered an address this evening
to his parishioners on "How Gambling la
Carried On in Alameda."
He said that there are two well-known
characteristics of pamblingâ hazard with
all the attendant excitement and the ab
sence of an equivalent for that which may
be gained. "The gambler." he said, "is
an anomalous member of society. He has
no god but chance, which is the wildest
sort of atheism. He ignores all the laws
of industry, which makes him an anarch
ist. His ends are not mutual advantage,
but simple robbery, though not so gross
and blnnt in methods yet as surely rob
bery as it thst of the highwayman.
"The Chief of Police thinks it is my
duty to run down and arrest evil doers.
There are several reasons why 1 cannot
comply with his request, the principal
one being that I should want some assur
ance that the Chief was on my side in the
contest."
The doctor then described the method
of gaining entry into these resorts and the
purchase of "chips" and the playing of
"draw poker." In concluding he said:
"I am convinced that a genuine revival
of righteousness and particularly right
eous indignation among the guardians
of the law would go a long way
toward stamping out the evils of our large
cities. A police that hang about the sa
loons, smoking, swearing and drinking,
are breeders, not suppressors, of crime.
Their duties are sacred and they have no
more right to lounge in the haunts of vice
than the clergyman and his deacons. If
these places are unfit for tne one they are
equally so for the other."
The People's Party.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 26. â The
People's party held a ratification meet
ing last night that was fairly well at
tended. Great credit was given to the
Democratic party for its enunciation of
some of the Populistic convictions. One
speaker said that the chief curse of the
country was the American Bankers' Asso
ciation and that while they ruled the
country the Populists would be found
ready to unite with any party to combat
their foe.

Strong Words From an Afro-Ameri

Oakland Ofkicb Baw Feait-isco Call,)
908 Broadway Ju'y26. Â£
Three days ago the colored Democrats of
San Francisco issued a challenge in The
Charles Felix T. Lafon of Oakland, Republican State Committeemanat-Lorge.
Call to their Republican brethren. The
vital part reads as follows:
We hereby ."publicly challenge the Republi
cans of this City to rind two men (we draw no
color line) who will meet us in joint debate on
issue* of the present campaign and their rela
tion to the Interests of the colored men of the
country, the debate to take place at Metropol
itan Temple at an early date and under the
auspices of the State central committees of the i
Republican and Democratic parties.
Charles Felix T. La lon of this city, a
well-informed Republican leader of his J
race, is highly indignant over the remarks
of the colored Democrats of San Francisco, j
Mr. Lafon, who is a member of the State
committee at large, makes the following
reply: '
I am ashamed and very much surprised to
read in Friday's pater the challenge from the
Colored Democratic club. 1 did not know that
there was existing such a body as the Colored
Democratic Club, for I do not believe that
those young and intelligent â  men . would sup
port a party that has : been an enemy to our
race and trodden them under foot for so many
years, a party that has . opposed every act â in
the Congress of the United States and in the
House that would benefit our race. I do not
believe they meant it as a challenge, and I do
not believe that there is a true colored Demo
crat at heart living to-day in the United
States.
As a true Republican, a politician and a
member of the State Committee at large I
would accept the challenge for the interest of
my party. . But I am called away: to Los An
geles as a delegate to the Colored Congress
from the Afro- American League.
â¢ I will give the Colored Democratic Club
this nut to crack And reflect upon. First, for a
colored man to be a Democrat he must be a
traitor to true principle, an enemy to justice
and a tyrant to his lawfu' friend and party
which is the original Republican party of Abe
Lincoln. McKiniey, the present leader of this
party, has stood in the battlefield weeping and
sighing while fighting for the. freedom of our
race and the union of our country, willing to
sacrifice his life for our cause, crying aloud
"Oh, God, let me see these people free from
this bondage. Soldiers, follow me to the front,
for this is the battle of freedom* to the negro
and our country."
Now, is there a colored man of principle
that would go back on such a man as this?
We say No 1 No! On the opposite side I can
provewhere Mr. Bryan and many other Demo
cratic Congressmen and. Senators cast their
votes, both in the House cf Congress and in
the Senate; of the United States, to shin us
away as dogs from our country to the wilds of
Africa, a country we know nothing about
This is what the Democrats would do lor us
Everything that was ever done in favor of
our race, for its elevation, enlightenment and
protection, has been done by the Brand old i
Republican party from the time the good and i
brave soldiers of the Union army entered into I
the battlefield : to sacrifice their life lor the !
freedom of our people and the union of the
great republic. Take history for, it, you will
find two-thirds of the army were stanch Repub
licans. The Republican party so loved our
people that they kept an army of soldiers all
through the South to protect our people until
such time as they were able to protect them
selves. This was done at great expense to the
Nation.
As I sit looking at the picture of one of the
greatest Republicans of the world who has
taken away the shackles of slavery from the
poor slave, T feel that I could sacrifice my
very life and soul for this great patriot, and
especially for the great genera), McKinley !
who is the friend of my race and our country i
Â£Â£ was a Republican, James A. Garfleld, who 1
once stood In ibe House of Congress and said-
Gentlemen, we must protect our black brothers

CALIFORNIA LANDS.
State Board of Trade Compiling a Circu
lar of Valuable Information.
J. A. Filcher, manager of the California
State Board of Trade, has struck upon a
new plan for gathering statistics of valua
ble information for the benefit of those in
the Eaai who contemplate changing their
homes. While Mr. Filcher was at the
Atlanta Exposition he met many people
who desire to settle in California, but who
labor under the erroneous belief that lands
in this State are very high priced and con
sequently difficult for one of moderate
means to acquire. Within the past week
Mr. Filcher has sent the following letter
to all of the newspaper proprietors in the
State:
I am convinced that people are being diverted
from California who would otherwise come,
because of the impression that prevails almost
universally throughout the East that lands
are so high here that a man of moderate means
cannot very well get afoothold. Many people
of the East and Middle West who are disposed
to change their location, are induced to go to
the Southern States, where it is represented to
them that land can be had at very low rates
and on easy terms. The impression regarding
hlgn prices of land iv California have been
created by conditions that prevailed here a few
years ago, but which are not true to-day.
In justice to our State, the people of the
East and of the world should know the truth,
and to this end we desire information from all
parts of California, from which can be com
piled a summary of the situation regarding
the terms and opportunities for obtaining
land here to-day.
I would be glftft, therefore, if you will pre
pare an article for your paper setting forth
specifically the situation in your locality, stat
ing the kind of land, what it is capable of pro
ducing and at what price and on what terms
the land you describe can be had.
The article will be effective in the first place
in disseminating information abroad on this
important matter regarding your section of thÂ«
State, and then if you wiil send us a copy of
the same, cut out and mailed in an envelope
so that it will not be overlooked, we will use it
in making up a summary of the situation in
California.
Trusting that I have made this matter clear,
and that you will act upon the suggestion, I
remain, etc.
Mr. Filcher will begin at once to compile
a circular in wtrch all of the information,
data, etc., will be summarized. These will
De put into an attractive form and sent all
over the East, where they wili naturally
catch the eye of the prospective home
seeker in the West.
WEDDED AMID APPLAUSE,
Salvation Army Camp-Meeting
Closes With a Double Mar
riage Ceremony.
Adjutant Willis Wins a Wife and
Is Promoted at the Same
Time.
Oakland Office San Feancibco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 26. $
The closing feature of the Salvation Army
camp-meeting was the double wedding that
took place this afternoon. The event was
solemnized in the pavilion, which held
about 2000 people, and as many more wit
nessed the ceremony from the outside.
Commander Booth-Tncker conducted the
meeting, and half an hour before the first
wedding he called for the brides and bride
grooms "so that the people could sice them
up." Ensign Campbell and Miss Lucas
entered first, and they were quickly fol
lowed by Staff-Captain Willis and Miss
Wise. Both the ladies are officers in the
army.
The commissioner then proceeded to
speak of marriages in general and Salva
tion Army weddings In particular, and of
the events of the afternoon in detail. He
rÂ«ad the articles of marriage from the army
ritual, and then called for Ensign Camp
bell and Captain Mattie Lucas. The cou
ple took their places on either side of the
commissioner and were married.
The responses were very clearly ren
dered by the bride, who wore her bonnet
and looked as much at home and as free
from nervousness as though she were con
ducting a meeting at Petaluma.
A large bouquet was handed to her and
she received it, while the vast audience
cheered and clapped its hands.
No sooner bad Staff-Captain Willis and
Staff-Captain Minnie Wise taken the posi
tions just vacated by Mr. and Mrs. Camp
bell than several in the crowd shouted,
"He's all right."
"He is," said the commissioner, and the
ritual was again performed. Allss Wise
was a little more nervous than the other
bride, but she recovered herself when
called upon to speak. All the newly
married folks gave a little teat'mony and
were loudly cheered.
Commissioner BoothrTucker then sprang
a little surprise. He called Staff Captain
Willis to the front and publicly an
nounced that he had been promoted to |
adjutant. As is usual in such cases his |
brother officers bounced him in the air, to
the creat (ielinht of the audience, the dis
comfort of the newly made adjutant and
to the consternation of his wife of five
minutes, who looked as fearful as though
her husband were being executed.
Rev. Mr. Wise of Ban Francisco then
spoke a few words. He is the father of
Mrs. Willis, and he said that he had two
daughters in the army, and he would be
very pleased if his other children fol
lowed their example.
Editor Milsop or the War Cry has re
turned to the desk from which he was
transferred several months ago and was
at tne meeting.
The campmeeting closed with to-night's
service, and meetings in all the corps wiil
be resumed at one*.
TURNED OUT TO
SEE THE BABIES,
Watching New Arrivals in
the Golden Gate
Park Zoo.
SOME DESIRABLE WALES
Proposition to Build a Grand
Amphitheater in the Vicinity
of the Cliff House.
" JOE," THE INTELLIGENT OBANG
A Pretty Ascent by Balloon, but a
Hard Way of Coming Downâ Miss
Viola's Experience on a Housetop.
The indications early yesterday were
that it would be an unpleasant day, but
before the midday there was a change lor
the better, and the result was an immense
crowd of people at the park, the beach and
the places of recreation in the western
part of the City.
The babies in the park, that is, the many
babies in the zoo, the baby elks and the
baby buffaloes, were the center of attrac
tion, and at no time have there been so
many people around the inclosures within
which the animals are kept as there was
yesterday.
But little work is being done in the park
at this time, as the Commissioners do not
know what amount of money they will be
allowed, and until tnat is known no defi
nite plans as to improvements will be de
cided upon.
The contemplated improvements are
the bridge across the main driveway to
the new music concourse, which it is esti
mated will cost from $25,000 to $30,000 if it
is to be finished in ornamental style; an
electric plant, which would be used to
illuminate the park in response to a popu
lar demand and which would cost about
$20,000; cases and cabinets for the new
annex to the museum, which will cost
about $6000, and tne fitting up of the con
course and building of the band stand at
one end of it. As to the cost of that there
is no estimate, as it has not been de
cided what kind of a structure should be
erected. It has been suggested that as the
street railway combine is in a great meas
ure benefited by the music and other at
tractions in the park it ought to erect the
new band stand.
The various footpaths that have been
covered with coarse gravel are provine a
great success and are blessed by pedes
trians who were in the past forcea to
trudge over dust that clung to and dam
aged wearing apparel. The proposition is
to ultimately cover all paths for pedes
trians with this kind of gravel.
There were several contributions to the
Park Museum during the week, the prin
cipal one being a donation by J. Z. Davis
of this City of curious swords, knives,
battle-axes, guns, spears and arrows that
were used in the long ago by some of the
old-time inhabitants of Europe, and which
will make an interesting addition to the
collection already in the armsroom. He
also gave a number of Japanese curios. J.
L. Bardwell donated three Japanese fig
ures and two ancient chalices. M. Braver
man of Visalia contributed six specimens
of gems.
During the afternoon a boy about 14
years of age was seen running down one of
the|paths near the bridge that leads to the
band-stand, and suddenly he reeled and
fell. Several persons ran to his assistance,
and found that he had become exhausted
in running away from a policeman and
dropped. In a short time he was restored
to consciousness, and it was ascertained
that an officer who had seen him using a
sling to kill birds had called to him, and
fearing arrest he ran away. When the offi
cer who had detected him in the violation
of one of tne park ordinances came up he
became very violent and made another at
tempt to run away, but he was held and
forced to accompany the officer to show
him "the other boy who did it."
Prior to the opening of the Midwinter
Fair the park was filled with quail and
other birds, but the unusual din and the
crowds there every day drove the birds all
away. For a long time what had become
of them was a mystery, but recently it has
been discovered that they have migrated
to the territory north of the pars and south
of Point Lobos avenue, and that many of
the quail have located on Sutro Heights.
The Mayor takes a great deal of pride in
the birds and has fed them every day.
The white seal, which has recently ap
peared on the rocks near the Cliff House,
was one of the objects that drew a big
crowd to the beach, but his scalship did
not put in an appearance, but that he was
on the rocks ana frightened away the oth
ers of darker hue is vouched for by Colonel
Wilkins.
The many attractions on "The Merry
Row" were viewed by the crowd, and tne
new scenic railway, which runs smoothly
since bearings have been run down, were
crowded with passengers all day long. By
night this is to be made attractive by
numerous electric lights. Mayor Sutro
took his first iconic railway ride yester
day.
Within the baths there was a good pro
gramme of performances in the water by
the California Swimming Club and spe
cialty artists on the platform. During the
afternoon J. Anderson of 821 Mission
street won the 50-yard race, and P. Schles
enger oi 534 Page street was second. Iv

The California Swimming Club will this
week issue a challenge to all comers for
the Spreckels trophy.
Arrangements are being made for the
placing of 150 tub baths in tbe big build
ing, and the work of placing them in posi
tion wiil probably be commenced this
week.
The large terraced space to the east of
the batlis will, it i; stated, shortly be
turned into a monster amphitheater. It
is proposed to build seats on the terrace,
plant trees to shade spectators, and to
have an immense platform at the bottom
of the terrace on which to give exhibitions
of Olympian games.
In view of the increased traffic on the
Sutro line a number of trailers are being
built to attach to regular trains and
thereby accommodate those who ride.
There was a great throng of people in
the recreation grounds, and the Chutes
and scenic railway carried full loads all
the afternoon. There were many who
entered tbe tent to pay their respects to
"Joe," the orang-ontang. He is a curious
little fellow, about three feet high, shaped
liked a human being, except as to face
and feet. The head differs from that of
the ape and is almost like that of what
is known a bullet-headed man. He is re
makably intelligent and comprehends
what is said to him as readily as a child
would. He is in great fear of the whip
and when he is chided or threatened with
a whipping he ambles up to his master,
places his great hairy arms around his
neck and placing his broad face and coarse
lips against his cheek kisses him.
In this he is as affectionate as a child,
and like a child seems to beg not to be
punished. He does a lew specialties and

does these well. He dresses himself,
smokes, pours milk from a bottle, uncork
ing and recorking it and holding a glass
in one hand uses it with the naturalness
of a human being. The fingers of his
hands are as well developed as those of a
man, and have finger-nails that many a
man would be prond of.
Miss Viola made a very pretty ascent
from the grounds, bat the descent was not
all she desired, and her experience in
reaching the roof of a bouse near Haight
and Octavia streets was not at all pleas
ant. Tbe balloon rose well and high, and
when it showed signs of descending the
aeronaut attempted to cut away, but with
out success.
She was seen tugging at the cutaway
line aud then the parachute opened, but
suddenly closed again, and then the bal
loon with the weight still attached to it
continued to descend. A second time the
parachute opened and closed again, and
the opinion was that Miss Viola would
come down with the balloon, but when
within a few feet of a roof the ropes that
held the parachute suddenly parted, the
balloon rose and Miss Viola iell on the
roof â a flat one â carrying the parachute
with her. Those who went to assist her
found her suffering from a sprain to one
of her ankles and from a number of
bruises, but none were serious. She was
taken to her home, where she received
proper attention.

REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
A Few Sales Reported, but
Mainly for Small
Amounts.
A GOOD BUILDING EECORD.
Business Prospects for This Fall.
Miscellaneous Notes of
Interest
The market continues dull. Sales are not
numerous, and the few that, are being made
are mainly of small properties. Some dealers
report a alight increase in inquiries tee past
week, but any marked increase in business is
not anticipated much before September 1. It
is generally believed that the volume of busi
ness this fall will not be equal to that of a year
apo, owing to the fact that it is Presidential
election year. When the result of the election
is known the season will be too well advanced
to permit of sufficient business Deing done,
even with the most tavorable conditions, to
bring up the total for the year to that of 1895.
The decrease in the amount of transfers for the
first six months of 1896 was 20 per cent, as
compared with the same period of last year.
At the present rate it looks as if the same per
centage of decrease would be maintained for
the entire year.
REVIEW OF THE RECORDS.
Last week there was a very favorable show
ing made in the number and amount of build
ing contracts recorded. Eight separate con
tracts, amounting to $18,340, were for the

$17,075, was for the new market building now
in course of erection by George D. Tay, on

THEIR ARMS AT ROME,
Why All the Naval Battalion
Equipment Was Not at
at Armory.
It Is Said That All the Divisions'
Property Can Be Mustered on
Call.
Captain Turner, lieutenant command
ing the naval battalion, made a short trip
with some friends to the battle-ship Ore
gon yesterday afternoon. He was seen
there by a Call reporter in regard to the
criticism of the arms and equipment of
the Xaval Reserve by Lieutenant-Colonel
Currier, division inspector of the National
Guard of California, in his recent annual
report.
Captain Turner declined to talk on the
subject of a report made by his superior
officer. He admitted the general correct
ness of the report m regard to the miss
ing arms and equipment, but said there
were some inaccuracies in it, which he laid
to the newspapers, and declined to specify.
The facts in regard to the missing arms
and equipments indicate more an inad
vertence by the men of the divisions than
carelessness in regard to the care of the
property. Some of the boys are good
shots, and in order to take better care of
the (runs they were permitted to take
them home and keep them in order there.
Many uniforms also were at home instead
ot at the armory, as in moving the divis
ions to the water-front armory the men
were each ordered to take care of his own.
The result of this arrangement was that
when Lieutenant-Colonel Currier appeared
for inspection of the quarters, etc., the arms
and other equipment not in the armory
were counted as missing. As a matter of
fact it is said that all the property of the
divisions can be mustered out on call.

NO MORE OIL
FROM UNCLE SAM
Sumatra May Supplant the
United States in
Japan.
BIG PRODUCTIVE WELLS.
Threaten to Supply All Oriental
Markets Inside of Five
Years.
DAMAGING TO THIS COAST.
A Great Dutch Industry That Will
Injure San Diego's Prospects
as a Port.
The island of Sumatra may within the
next five years supplant the United States
as Japan'u source of supply for kerosene.
What that means to this country can be
inferred from the fact that last year Japan,
according to the United States Minister in
Tokio, who returned to this City yesterday
from Washington, imported about 30,000,
--000 gallons of oil from America.
Dr. Muir. who was for many years an
oil-refiner at Titusville, arrived at the
Occidental yesterday with his family. A
little over fonr years ago he established an
oil refinery for a big Dutch company in
the then recently discovered oil fields far
in the interior of Sumatra. Since that
time he has been constantly employed
managing the refinery and perfecting the
plant.
He returned to America a few weeks
ago to get his family, ana is now on his
war back to Sumatra, where he has orders
to begin the construction of two more re
fineries, so extensive is the business be
coming.
The oil region is on the bank of a navi
gable river, and is practically in the heart
of the jungle.
The Dutch own the island. The Dutch
own the wells ana the refinery, and the
Dutch hold all the managerial positions
connected with the oil business.
Mr. Muir is the only American among
fifteen Dutchmen who have charge of a
colony of nearly 5000 natives and half
castes who are employed about the vari
ous departments of the business, which
includes a can factory, a box factory and
a sawmill, good timber being found close
at hand.
British and Chinese steamers come up
the river and load the cases of oil right
at the relinery. Tbey carry them to Singa

Twelve wells are in operation in the one

find them.
All thin information 13 in substance
what Mr. Muir said yesterday, but he par
ticularly requested not to be quoted lest it
might affect the company's plans.
He declared very emphatically that in
five years from now no petroleum will be
shipped from the United States to Japan.
He also said that Japan gets some oil
from Russia, but that it is not high grade.
He refused to say what the quality of
the Sumatra oil is, but reiterated his as
sertion in regard to toe future exports
from this country to Japan.
Mr. Muir has been in the cftl refinery
business for thirty-one years.
One of the principal reasons, Sho Ne
moto, the Japanese Commissioner of Com
merce, stated the other day, in favor of
San Diego as a terminus for one of the
new Japanese steamship lines, was that it
would be a more convenient port at which
to load kerosene, raw cotton and ma
chinery for the Japanese markets.
"For," he said, "our country imports
great quantities of kerosene from Amer
ica."
The State Mining Bureau's expert has
disclosed, after an investigation of a year
and a half in the oil regions of Southern
California, that this State is a great un
developed oil region that must rival Penn
sylvania. A. S. Cooper, the Santa Barbara
oil expert, has said the same thing.

PRECINCT REGISTRATION.
Its Possibility Still an Ex
tremely Doubtful
Question.
Populists to Make a Strong Fight for
Two Officers on Precinct
Election Boards.
The possibility of precinct registration,
instead of approaching a certainty as the
days draw near election, on the other
band seems to become more iurolved.
Leading Populists term the system simply
a means of corruption, and lay upon it the
whole blame lor the trouble of two
years ago.
"I am a workingman," said one, "and I
do not see why other workingmen in the
City cannot afford one. day in two years
to go down to the City Hall to register,
where there is little chance of unfair
methods being used."
They cinim there is no oupervision in
piecinct registration and nearly 1000 men
are required to do the same work that ten
or fifteen at the City Hall could do much
better.
The main figbt now on the hands of
the State central committees of the Re
publican and Democratic parties is to bee
that good men are appointed to serve at
the different precincts at the time of
election.
A canvass is being made in the wards
for the names of those clerks, judges and
"nspectors that were published on the
black list of two years ago. As soon as
the Election Commissioners announced
the appointees for a certain ward a writ
ten protest is forwarded the board, to
which is appended a list of the men found
wanting in the balance two years ago.
This is done on the supposition that if
am an falls from grace once he is likely to
do so again.
It is said that the Board of Commission
ers are paying special attention to these
lists. They hold secret sessions at which
they appoint election officers and an
nounce the names when they are ready.
They are particularly careful that the
lists shall be authentic, and sometimes
demand to see the court records.
Between fifteen and twenty names have
been cited daily as unfit for appointment.
Eighteen will be cited to-day.
The Populists trill make a strong effort
to get two men from their party ap
pointed on the election board in each pre
cinct, instead of one, as the law really
allows.
A prominent Populist said yesterday:
"We do not want to get men on the board
Â»imply for what there is in it. We want
to watch and see that we get a square deal
when the ballots are being counted."
MAHER AND CHOYNSKI.
The Native Son Wants to Fight Manor
Here and Then lletire From the
King.
Peter Ma her and his manager, Connolly,
waited yesterday afternoon at the Bald
win expecting to see Joe Choynski on his
arrival from Howell Mountain. Choynski
did not show up, however, and as a matter
of fact there was nothing new in the way
of a fight taking place in this City be
tween Peter and Joseph.
Connolly received a dispatch from his
partner, Quinn, which stated that one
of the leading sporting clubs of New York
had bid |6000 lor a twenty-round contest
between the heavy-weights, the match to
take place in September.
Connelly stated that under the circum
stances he would net dream of matching
his protege against the Native Son for any
consideration short of $6000.
"We will co East on Thursday next,"
remarked Mr. Connelly, "unless some
ti.ing good turns up in tne meantime to
detain us here."
Eddie Graney, manager for Cboynski,
was seen last evening, and he said posi
tively that Choynski will not journey
East any more: that he proposed settling
down in this City, and that if Jdatier has
the remotest idea of meeting him the con
test must take place in this City under the
auspices of some of the local clubs.
"I judge that $45U0 j 8 a pretty good snm
of money to fight for nowadays," said
Graney, "and Maher must be dreaming
when he refuses to box eight rounds for
this money.
"He can return East after this contest
and meet some other man for one of those
promised purses, but you can state for a
/act that Choynr-ki has decided to quit
pugilism and settle down to business of
some kind in this Citj. This will be
Maher's last chance of meeting him, and
he had be tier get a move on himself."

ARMS AND FOOD
FOR THE CRETANS
California Greeks to Aid
Their Persecuted Coun
trymen.
MUCH MONEY COLLECTED
Hellenic Benevolent Society
Leads in the Soliciting
of Funds.
ALL THE GREEKS
President Demetrak of Berkeley Talks
Freely of the Cretan
Situation
BERKELEY, Cal., July 26.â The
Greeks of California are raising a fund to
supply munitions of war to their perse
cuted countrymen on the isle of Crete.
The recent dispatches concerning the
barbaric treatment received by the Hel
lenes at the hands of the Turks on the Cre
tan Island have caused nearly every native
Greek of America to turn his attention in
the direction of his mother country, and
to lend what assistance is possible from
this side of the Atlantic. The movement
by the Greek-Americans to supply funds
to purchase arms, ammunition and pro
visions for their maltreated countrymen
has been going on silently for the past six
weeks.
The Grecian benevolent societies in
nearly every State in the Union have been
raising money for this purpose. The tide
of sympathy and the desire to extend
financial aid to the Cretans have reached
this State. The Hellenic Benevolent So
ciety of California, the strongest of all the
Greek organizations on the Pacific Coast,
has taken up the matter and is making
â¢.'ood progress in the raising of a fund for
the defense of the Cretans against the
Turkish power, and for the re-establish
ment of the Grecian power over the
"green isle of the Mediterranean."
C. Demetrak, president of the Benevo
lent Society and a citizen of Berkeley, has
the work in charge. He, together with
the other three officers of the society, con
sisting of George t'undas, vice-president;
A. Papageorge, secretary, and A. Kosta,
treasurer, compose a committee appointed
by the society to take the work of secur
ing subscriptions in band.
They have been at the work for onjy a
short time, and already several hundred
dollars have been subscribed.
In an Interview to-day with a Cam, cor
respondent, Mr. Demetrak told of the
persecution which his people are now
forced to bear at the hands of the heart
less Turks in Crete, and of the work of as
sisting them with equipage for war, which
he and his associates had undertaken. He
said: "We are toing to collect all the
funds we possibly can for our persecuted
friends, the Cretans, who are now fighting
for their liberty against the dog-hearted
Turks.
"Every one knows the circumstances
surrounding the last troubles which the
Cretans have been having with the Turks.
Crete is one of the largest islands of the
Mediterranean Sea. It is a beautiful green
island ana tue pride of the Grecian archi
pelago because of its excellent climate, its
fertile soil, its nearness to the mainland
and its many historic associations. It has
a population at the present time of about
200,000 Greeks, besides the Turks and a
few other foreigners.
"The Cretans have been fighting against
the Turks many times during the last few
hundred years, but this struggle for their
rights will be the final one, because they
have made up their minds to secure lib
erty or perish in the attempt. They are
not asking for any held from any one, ex
cepting their mother â Greece. They say
they can, if left alone, run the Turkish
forces off the island and burn all the
Turkish ships, and set up in the middle of
the island the blue and white flag of
Greece. I believe that they can do all they
claim, for I know full well what the
Grecians who love their country are when
it comes to a matter of liberty, and the es
tablishment of their rights. Sometimes
the Grecian people have quarrels and dis
agreements among themselves, but when
there comes an issue of such importance
to our nation as the present one, we are
as one body â a single unit. We care not
for our lives so long as we can secure our
posÂ»erity their just heritage.
"Once Greece was the most prosperous
country in all the earth; then her power
and strength waned ; persecution came
upon us later and some of the stronger
powers of Europe attempted to overthrow
us entirely and to deprive us of what
little we had remaining. We are now de
termined, in the face of much opposition
and almost overwhelming difficulties, to
regain at least a portion of the territory
and authority that nas been snatched by
unclean bands from us.
"We are nol asking for anything but
justice. We want the property which be
longs to us, but which has been taken
from us by mightier powers. The great
countries of Europe pretend they are good
friends of Greece, but we know by this
tiroejthat they are most dangerous enemies.
They have promised often and often to
assist us in securing what really is ours.
We have become tired waiting for their
promises to be realized, and so now we do
not ask their help, for we do not need it.
All we want is to be let alone and we can
ol ourselves drive tue barbnrous Turks
from our midst and from all Europe â for
that matter, into Asia, where they belong.
"Lately I have learned through tele
grams from Athens that the great powers
of Europe nave requested the Grecian
Government to keep quiet and they would
take upon themselves the responsibility of
settlinp the Cretan question. They did
not wish the Grecians to send any ships of
war to help the poor Cretan mothers and
children who are suffering at the hands of
the Turkish forces, but wished that the
whole matter be left to them for adjust
ment. But we are certain now what the
European powers attempted to do in re
questing us to leave the settlement of the
diffii ulty to them. We do not intend to
ask their advice any longer, but have now
taken the matter in our own hands and
will pusn it to an issue. Just as fast as
money is raised here by our society we will
send guns, cartridges, swords, clothing and
provisions to the Cretans â our brothers â
in order that their rights might be pre
served.
"1 saw by a dispatch from Athens yes
terday that a party of Greek insurgents
had entered Macedonia and routed a de
tachment of Turkish troops at Kara-Tsari,
near Moussa, killine all but three out of
the band of eighty-three. I was pleased
to learn of this, and before long we will
hear more of the same kind of news, un
less the Turks recede and give the Gre
cians their rights and liberties.
I'Thoueh 1 am a native-born Bpartan,"
said Demetrak, 4i l am an American citi
zen through and through, but when I
hear of the wrong heaped upon my own
people and the struggle tney are having
for their rights, then I shall come to the
front and do all I can for their interests.
"We Greeks have recognized that the
American people have been kind to us in
the past, and have befriended us in many
ways, for all of which we are very thank
ful. We know that in any case when it
comes to a question of justice Americans do
the right thing, and we hope that in the
present struggle they will rssist ns in so
far as they can. We will be glad to re
ceive donations from all parties interested
in the promulgation of justice in foreign
countries, and especially in the restora
tion of the Grecian people to their author
ity over the Isle of Crete and in the pre
vention of further atrocities among them
at the hands of the Turks.
"As the Cubans have been persecuted
and have risen up to defend their rights,
so have we been trodden down, and will
protect our interests."

HOW THE LADY
MISSED THE SHOW.
And Louis W. Martin Was
Soundly Thrashed Next
Morning.
THE WIFE BEGAN IT.
Dow Williams, the Horseman,
Bravely Came to Her
Assistance.
BESSIE RYAN'S ACCIDENT.
A Clerk Dropped Into a Market-S'reet
Cafe and Was Kicked Down
stairs at Home. .
Dow Williams is a Creole horseman. He
has been behind and training running
horses the most of his life. So when he
rose up from his chair the other day and
began to pummel the face of Louis W.
Martin it is not astonishing that the blows
landed on Martin's physiognomy at a 2:04
pace.
Martin is a clerk in a prominent down
town store. He met on the street the
other day * handsome young woman,
Miss Bessie Ryan, eighteen years of age.
Martin used to know some of her rela
tions and insisted on claiming an acquain
tance with her on that account. She, on
this account, finally satisfied him by as
senting to receive his attentions.
Miss Ryan is a young woman of ele
gant figure, oval face, gray eyes and brown
hair. She has previously received some
public notice in reference to an acquaint
anceship with "Lucky" Baldwin. When
she appeared last night out at the resi
dence of Dow Williams on Clement street
she was the picture of attractive demure
ness in a negligee gown of blue. Miss
Ryan is charming in her simplicity, and
she increased the impression by having
nothing to say, or, rather, by being per
mitted to say nothing.
On a recent evening Miss Ryan accepted
an invitation from Mr. Martin to attend a
tneater. Mr. Martin was well known to
Mr. and Mrs. Dow Williams jand they did
not think it necessary, to chaperon the
young couple on their trip downtown.
But previous to going to their seats at
the show they strolled down Market street
and in a forgetful moment, productive of
much subsequent regret, dropped into a
fashionable cafe not a hundred miles from
Montgomery street. Soft lights and pic
torial art had tneir effect at the beginning.
From Napa soda and lemonade the
young couple passed to drink when it is
brown with a cuff on it, to wine when it
is red and to wine when it comes at $5 per
quart, heedless of the old injunction not
to look upon strong drink when it is rag
ing.
There was some excuse in this for the
demure young lady, for her physician had
pronounced her frail in health and rec
ommended port wine for her consump
tion.
But the itory does not end with the
wine. It seldom does. Young Martin,
the confidential clerk, became too confi-
dential. The jolly yet unhappy young
lady was too late for the theater and in no
mood to go home. She bad, unfortunately,
overestimated her capacity for the part
which puts roses in the cheeks and self*
assurance in the demeanor, and when the
time came to take a Geary-street car for
Richmond and beyond she declined to go
home. Morpheus was her resort, and to
him she had recourse, appealing to the
proprietress of adjoining rooms.
Miss Ryan is a stepdaughter of Dow
Williams. Wtoen young Martin appeared
the next day at the Clement-street resi
dence he came to "square himself." it is
said, and to explain how it happened.
The young lady had previously arrived
and explained bow it came that she missed
the theater and her usual hours of sleep in
her own bouaoir. She frankly told them
that though she spent all the nijrht alone
she did not want to come home while
under the accidental and unexpected "im
pression" of the cafe on MarKet street.
So when Mr. Martin reached the Clem
ent-street house be met with an astonish
ing reception. Mrs. Dow Williams got
into his hair for happening to "keep Miss
Ryan out until next day. Her reception
was so vigorous that he sought to protect
himself as best he could.
Then Mr. Williams came on to the scetie.
The result was very unhappy for Mr.
Martin. He was alone in the house of his

NAVAL ENGINEERS BLUE,
There Are Few Opportunities for
Promotion in Their
Work.
Bright Young Men Leave the Service
for Better Places in the
Busy World.
A great many men in the United States
navy are beginning to wonder what the
Government intends to do to maintain an
efficient service, now that the White
Squadron is growing great.
It is not generally known outside of
naval circles that there is great unrest
among the brighter young men that enter
the service because the pay and oppor
tunities for promotion are not great. A
number of old past engineers have been
investigating the matter lately and there
is a probability that steps will be taken at
an early day to urere legislation to make
the naval billets more attractive. " '
"I am about the only man I know who
is in a position to talk freely," said Presi
dent C. A. Wight of the Hawaiian Steam
ship Company at the Occidental Hotel a
few nights ago. Continuing, he said:
"Nearly all the bright young men leave
the engineering corps of the navy. They
see that they work harder than deck offi
cers, yet have almost no recognition and
few opportunities for the future. The
result is that they abandon the navy and
tatce up other callings. Those who re
main are overworked and often inefficient.
I know that there are not enough engi
neers on the great cruisers and battle
ships.
"1 know that there are men in respon
sible places who do not understand the
machinery they work with. As a result
tdere will be great youDle Borne day. It
seems to me that While Americans have
been building many fane ships they have
almost entirely overlooked the fact that
the provision caring for machinists and
engineers is antiquated and wholly unfit
for these times."
Continuing, Mr. Wight said: "I am
myself an example in point. I quit the
navy, becauss I saw that about $5 a day
was the limit, and because I saw that the
deck officers treated engineers with about
as much consideration as they would treat
a dog. I know of many other men who
have quit for similar reasons."
