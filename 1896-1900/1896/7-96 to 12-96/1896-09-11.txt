VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 103.
HANNA TALKS OF
BRYAN'S LETTER
An Appeal to the Poor to
Battle Against the
Rich.
IT IS A FALSE POLICY.
And With It No Candidate for
President Has Ever Been
Successful.
KEPTJBLICANS GAIN HEADWAY
From Many Sections Come Assurances
That Major McKinley Will Be
Elected.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept 10.â Chairman
Henna is still directing the "details of or
ganization" at Republican headquarters.
He is kept busy eight hours a day talking
to and being talked to by scores of. politi
cians and business men. He will devote
most of his time until election day to the
West, where he acknowledges there is
much hard wort yet to be done to make
success a sure quantity.
Mr. Hanna said to-day to a reporter for
the United Associated Presses that the re
ports which he had received since he had
arrived last Saturday showed the Republi
cans were getting most of what he termed
the uncertain element among the electors,
and the party was steadily recovering lost
ground. He declared the best and most
numerous element of organized labor was
friendly to McKiniey, and agitators like
Debs were against the Republican party
because it was composed of men who had
been successful.
Mr. Hanna took up the subject of Mr.
Bryan's letter of acceptance, and comment
ing on the brief reference to free coinage
said:
"Mr. Bryan admits the failure of his
arguments for free silver and he gives
rotice in his letter that henceforth he will
deal with the rest of the Chicago platform.
He will appeal to the masses to array
themselves against the classes, the poor
against the rich. He intends to appeal to
the passions and prejudices of men. He
sadly mistakes the intelligence of the
American workingman if he minks they
will support him. No candidate for Presi
ever smcceÂ»d*<i with sucu a
policy."
John M. Ewing, secretary of the Wiscon
sin committee, called and asserted his old
allegiance and reports that Wisconsin will
give 50,000 majority for McKinley, the
Germans being almost solid lor him.
The resignation of Sterling H. Holt,
chairman of the Indiana Democratic com
mittee, was regarded at headquarters as
an indication that the gold Democrats of
the State intended to make a fignt against
the Bryan followers and 15,000 to 20,000
votes go to McKinley.
J. D. Elliott, chairman of the South
Dakota committee, wrote to Cnief Hahn
of the speakers' bureau: "We have them
on the run in this State. We are making
a schoolhouse campaign and the reports
which I receive daily show that the silver
voters are enrolling themselves with the
McKinley clubs, fcouth Dakota will surely
go Republican. I have made one hundred
assignments for speakers in the last three
days."
Hon. Roswell G. Horr of New York
wrote from Kansas to Mr. Hahn that he
had never in his political campaign ex
perience had such large meetings to ad
dress. When the halls and tents were
filled there was always an overflow meet
ing to address. He said Kansas was
ablaze and the Republicans working har
moniously.
Mr. Hahn to-day assigned Hon. Ben
Butterworth of Ohio and F. X. Schoon
maker of Illinois, among other speakers,
to make a tour of the Pacific Coast States,
speaking in Minnesota, Nebraska and
Wyoming first. This is the first time a
National committee has attempted to sup
ply speakers for the Coast States.
Terence V. Powderly, the labor leader,
has been engaged by the National Com
mittee to make a speaKing toar through
the West especially for workingmen, be
ginning about Septem ber 25.

GREAT MILITARY MANEUVERS.
Eighty Thousand German Soldiers Engage
in Sham Encounters at
Goerlitz.
BERLIN, Germany, Sept. 10.â The mili
tary maneuvers were resumed at Goerlitz
to-day, both armies beginning to move at
6 o'clock in the morning. The right ,wing
of the Prussians pressed the Eighth Saxon
Division back upon Schaff berg, whereupon
the Thirty-second Saxon Division came to
tao aid of the Eighth Division and stayed
the advance of the Prussians.
In the meantime the right wing of the
Saxon troops drove a wedge into the Prus
sian Sixth Corps, while the extreme right
of the Saxons outflanked the Sixtn Corps
of Prussians, getting the latter under a
cross fire at Kopschuetz.
At this juncture the Emperor called a
halt, and the Sixth Prussian Corps then
re-formed and the operations were re
opened. At 11 o'clock in the forenoon the
Prussian Sixth Corps had driven back the
Saxons' left win â¢ on the bases of the Jenk
witz and Kama. Eighty thousand men,
440 guns and 7000 horses were in action
along a line reaching several miles.
DEATH OF ACTOR LEWIS.
Few Members of the Theatrical
Profession Were More
Beloved
For Nearly Twenty Years He Ap
peared With Mrs. Gilbert in
Daly's Productions.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 10.â James
Lewis, the well-known actor, died sud
denly at West Hampton, L. 1., this morn
ing from heart failure. The news of his
death was telephoned to his manager,
Augustin Daly, shortly before 9 o'clock
and within half an hour the news was
known all along the Rialto. Expressions
of regret were heard on every side, for
there are few members of the profession
who were more beloved.
Next to Mrs. Gilbert, who has just cele
brated her seventy-sixth birthday, Mr.
Lewis was the oldest member of the Daly
company. He was born in Troy, N. V.,
58 years ago, and lor a number of years
was engaged in mercantile work. His
adopting the stage as a profession was an
accident. A friend of his who was acting
in a small stock company feJl ill, and
Lewis at the last moment was persuaded to
bo on in his part. He made a hit, and was
so delighted with the stage that he took
to It permanently. In the annals of the
American stage Lewis' name will also be
indelibly associated in an artistic sense
with Mrs. Gilbert. For nearly twenty
years these two have been playing opposite
parts in the Daly productions, "Nancy and
Company," "A Night Off," "The Railroad
of Love," "The Taming of the Shrew,"
and a thousand and one other productions
which have seen the light at Daly's and
have been foreotten.
In London Lewis was, If anything, even
a greater lavonte than in New York.
Years ago when the Daly company was at
the zenith of its success, the London critics
used to refer to them affectionately as the
great fourâ Renan, Drew, Gilbert and
Lewis.

SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 11, 1896.
Idle Laborerâ "What's that, Mr. Bryan?''
COLLAPSE OF THE
MUTUAL NATIONAL
One More Bank at New
Orleans Compelled to
Suspend.
DUE TO HEAVY DRAINS.
Depositors Became Suspicions
and Made a Run That
Causes the Failure.
MORE MONEY COULD HOT BE HAD
Now All Clearing House Banks Will
Only Pay One Hundred Dollars
on Checks.
NEW ORLEANS. La., Sept. 10.â The
Mutual National Bank closed its doors
this morning. The effect of this suspen
sion has been discounted as it was well
known to be in a bad way. Shortly after
the American National Bank failed a run
was made on the Mutual and the collapse
of the bank at that time appeared inevit
able.
Luckily the rnn was started on Saturday
shortly before noon, and Saturdaj being a
le. al half holiday in New Orleans, fortune
was on the side of the pressed institution.
By Monday morning it had a chance to
recuperate. The clearing-house held a
meeting, and the other banks of the city,
fearing a panic, came to the rescue and
advanced money enough to meet all de
mands on Monday.
Large sums of money came here from
various sources, and the United
States sub-treasury was paying out the
sugar bounty as fast as possible. Before
noon of the day the run ceased and all
looked favorable.
The president states that a steady drain
has been made by depositors taking ont
their money. The unexpected failure of
the Union National Wednesday aroused
the suspicions of depositors and another
rush was made on the Mutual.
The clearing-house banks had advanced
the Mutual $100,000, a little more than
$17,000 of which had been repaid. Last
hiL-iit the Mutual tendered the clearing
house another lot of collaterals, and asked
for further assistance to the extent of $25,
-000. This the clearing-house refused, and
the suspension of the Mutual followed
thi- morning.
The president says: "The bank owes
depositors $92,993 72. which we have ample
assets to pay dollar for dollar."
President Baldwin of the clearinghouse
says:
"The officers of the bank foresaw what
was coming, and, as is customary in such
case?, called on the other banks to come
once more to their assistance. A bank in
distress is expected to hypothecate securi
ties that will justify other banks in lend
ing the assistance. The security offered
by the Mutual was not considered 'the
proper quality of paper to justify the
clearing-house in making the loan and
the ossistance was refused."
The bank was organized in 1871 with a
capital of $100.0:0. In January, 1895, the
Mutual absorbed the Traders' Bank and
most of the stockholders of the Traders'
Bank became interested in the Mutual.
At a meeting of the clearing-bouse the
financial situation was discussed and the
iollowing resolution was adopted:
Resolved. Tnat for the present the clearing
nous â  banks shall not pay out o i checks more
than $100 to any one depositor in one dayâ all
other payments shall be made by certification
of checks, which shall be received upon de
posit by the clearing-house banks.
This step was necessary as a precaution.
Employers of labor will be supplied with
money to meet their payrolls. It was also
agreed to adopt a system of clearing
house certificates similar to tuat used in
New York during the crisis of 1893. The
savings banks also took steps to prevent a
run by posting the sixty-day rule.
There are no new developments in the
case of the Union National. President
Chalaron is bitterly criticized to-day for
bis precipitate action in closing the bank
without consulting the directors. He is
in seclusion and will see no one.
Bank Examiner Johnson, temporarily
in charge of tne Union Bank, was formerly
confidential bookkeeper and agent for A.
and V. Meyer, whose failure seriously at
fected the bank. This fact has caused
much comment. To-day another Bank
Examiner has been ordered to take his
place, a protest having been wired to
Comptroller Eckels against Mr. Johnson
continuing in charge.
SHOT IN THE CABANA FORTRESS.
Luis Martinez Put to Death by the
Spanish for AHegsd Rebellion and
Incendiarism.
HAVANA, Ccba, Sept. 10.â Luis Mar
tinez, one of the men who took part in
the expedition landed by the filibustering
vessel Three Friends, was shot in the Ca
bana fortress to-day, for the crime of re
bellion and incendiarism.
The rebels placed dynamite cartridges
on the railway tracks near Ramblazo, in
the Puerto Principe district.
The en. iue of a military train, when it
passed over the cartridge, caused an ex
plosion, which blew it from the track and
badly damaged the cars. The engineer,
conductor and two passengers, an officer
and a private were injured.
Four thousand troops arrived here from
Spain to-day. The steamer Alfonzo XII
will carry on her outward passage twelve
culprits, who have been sentenced to the
military prisons on the Ceuta and Saffarin
islands.
BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE.
Its Anniversary Observed by an
Interesting Celebration at
Cleveland.
One of the Participants a Daughter of
Ben Fl mingr, a Gunner on
the Lawrence.
CLEVELAND, Otiio, Sept. 10.â The
anniversary of the battle of Lake Erie
was a holiday for the city. The majority
of the shops and factories closed, and the
city put on a gala dress for the occasion.
Commodore Perry's monument in Wade
Park was covered with flags and flowers.
Great numbers of visitors from Northern
Ohio came to the city.
Governor Bushnell of Ohio presided at
the morning exercises. He suggested
that Congress or the State ought to ap
propriate money to erect a monument on
Put-in-Bay Island to the memory of the
men killed in the battle of Lake Erie. He
then introduced Governor Warren Lippitt
of Rhode Island, the orator of the day,
who delivered;* 7 stirring address.
Ex-Senator M. C. Butler of South Caro
lina, a nephew, and Oliver Hazard Perry
of Elmhurst, N. V., a grandson of the
commodore, were introduced and made re
marks.
One of the most interesting incidents
of the morning meeting was the intro
duction of Mrs. Elizabeth McPeteis. She
is a daughter or Ben Fleming, one of the
gunners on the Lawrence. She is now an
inmate of the City Infirmary. General
Axline sprang to his feet and moved that
steps be taken to take her from the insti
tution and give her a comfortable home.
L. E. Hclden promised that she would
be removed.
Rev. C. E. Manchester, a cousin of Com
modore Perry, delivered the closing
prayer.
An imposing civic and industrial parade
toole place this afternoon, the streets
through which the procession moved be
ing thronged with people.
The battle of Lake Erie was reproduced
on the lake front this evening, closing the
celebration. The display was a success
and witnessed by an immense crowd.

LONDON. Esq., Sept. 10.â A dispatch to
a news agency says that a cyclone from
the southwest passed over Paris at 2:30
o'clock this afternoon, doing much dam
age. A number of vehicles were blown
over and young trees torn up by the roots.
The window* of the Palace of Justice

in torrents.
The Paris correspondent of the Tele

in the storm. The roofs of the Tribunal
of Commerce and the Prefecture of Police
were torn off.
PARIS, Fbascb. Sept. 6.â Traffic in the
streets was stopped for two hours by a
seven* wind and rain storm that passed
over this city to-day. The wind blew
with hnriicane force ana the downpour of
rain was torrential. Much damage was
done and several persons were injured by
being struck by flying debris.
Two hours before the storm broke the
atmosphere gave indications of its coming.
It was dark ana sultry and tne clouds had
a peculiarly lowering appearance.
Among the buildings that stood in the
pathway of the cyclone was the Opera
Comique, V. c roof of which was blown in.
Most of the persons injured were cab
drivers.
A reporter of the Temps, who witnessed
the cyclone from the top of an omnibus,
says that it did not last more than a
minute. He suddenly saw what appeared
to be a tall pillar of smoke advancing, and
imagined that there was a large hre. But
almost immediately he saw the branches
of trees snapped off and countless chimney
pots hurled to the ground. Then the
storm immediately passed away. Those
on the omnibus were untouched.
The west end of the city wholly escaped
the fury of the storm, but eastward along
the river much destruction was caused.
Between the Pont St. Michael and Pont
Neuf forty large trees were torn out of the
ground and blown into the Seine. Many
persons who were crossing the bridges or
along the river front were caught up by
the wind and thrown into the river, but so
far as Known ali these were rescued. Some
of those in the path of the storm were
dashed against houses and injured. Many
cabs were literally blown to pieces, so vio
lent was the force of the wind.

Rumors That the Powers Are Considering
the Question of Deposing the Ruler
Are Confirmed.
LONDON, Eng., Sept. 10.â It is reported
that a private dispatch arrived here to
night from Constantinople confirming the
rumors that the powers are seriously con
sidering the question of deposing the Sul
tan. It is added 'that important develop
ments are expected from the probable ac
tion of the Sheikh-ul-Islam, whose fiat is
necessary for the legal removal of the
Caliph.
A few days ago Mr. Gladstone was re
quested to address a mass-meeting to be
held at Liverpool for the purpose of con
demning the Sultan of Turkey for permit
ting the massacres of Armenians. In reply
to the request, Mr. Gladstone has written
a letter in which be says: "My opinions
of the disgrace the European powers have
allowed him to bring upon them are well
known to my countrymen, but I do not
think that benefit would accrue from my
taking part in meetings, however valu
able and even obligatory such meetings
may be for those still engaged in the active
duties of public, life."
ATHENS, Geeeck. Sept. 10. â In conse
quence of the receipt of a peremptory
British note, the Sultan of Turkey has is
sued an irade ordering that the expulsion
of Armenians from Constantinople be
stopped.

BTOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 10.â Stockton
is playing a thinking part to-night. It is
a real pleasure too, for it is the first oc
casion this week on which the residents of
the Mill City have had either the time or
inclination to do so. The visiting Native
Sons and Daughters have gone, their ac
companying friends have vanished, the
blare of bands is no longer heard in the
street; the marchers, the holiday enthu
siasm, the crowds, are missing; nothtng
of the Ailmission day festivities are left to
Stockton's people but the memory and
the decorations. The flags, the streamers,
the bunting, float gayly in the breeze; the
red and blue and white and yellow lights
blink owl-like in the darkness, and the
lonesome resident waiks the street, his
hands deep in his trousers pockets â and
thinks.
He thinks that he would that there
were 365 Admission days per year and
that they were all celebrated in
Stockton. ,To-morrow he will resume his
usual ideaâ that his town is the gateway
to the San Joaquin Valley, and that it is
time to go back to work.
After the carnival last night the crowds
of visitors began to depart. At 2 o'clock
this morning two trainioads of Natives
started for San Francisco and a little
later the boats left for the same place.
The Sacramento delegation departed early
this morning and at 12:10 and 3:40 o'clock
this afternoon the last of the Bay City vis
itors journeyed homeward.
The final number on the programme of
the entertainment committee was carried
out this morning. It was the race for the
Governor's cup, Governor Budd having of
fered a challenge trophy to be raced fo r
annually by launches. The executive and
his party were present to see the event.
But six aspirants showed up at the ap
pointed time, two of which, because of
their small size, seemed to have no chance.
It was agreed that the launches should
be brought as near together as possible by
arranging a time allowance. The length
over all of each contestant was measured,
and the Dirigo, the longest, was made to
allow each of her shorter competitors
fifteen seconds per mile for each foot she
out measured them; that is, as the course
was over a distance of four and a half
miles, each boat larger than another al
lowed the shorter one 67>Â£ seconds a foot.
Few spectators were present when the
boats lined up for the race, which was run
in two heats. The Dirigo finished first in
the initial trial, her actual time being 30
mm. 55 sec. Favorita was second in 32:33
and the Naval Re.-erve launch Camanche
third in 33:04. In the second heat Nor2
wood finished first in 35:11, Se Da second
in 41:57 and Cuckoo third in 42:07. The
corrected time was: Camanche, 29:34;
Dirigo, 30:55; Favorita. 30:55^; Norwood,
34:37; Seba, 34:57; Cnckoo, 36:07.
The Camanche therefore won by almost
a minute, with the Dirigo, which is
really much tbe fastest boat of the lot,
second, but a fraction of & second before
the Favorita.
Ferris Hartman, whose vast knowledge
of yachts and yachting acquired during
his residence in Sausalito appalled the
Stockton boatmen, was appointed com
puter of the official time. He is still try
ing to explain to the Dirigo's owner bow
he made that boat allow the Camanche
two minutes and nine seconds on a four
and a half-mile course at the rate of fifteen
seconds per mile for each foot tbe Dirigo
is longer than the Camanche when the
latter craft sanded the track and carried
real sailors in uniform and finished third,
while the Dirigo was first. The amiable
comedian will probably bave to hire an
accountant to get bis books straight.
Lynn, a member of the Stockton Ath
letic Association, won the junior shell
race postponed from yesterday. Foley, his
only competitor, did not finish.
ONE GJiAA FREEDOM.
Jiesperate Break of 3u>o Murderers Front
a Penitentiary.
LEAVENWORTH, Kaks , Sept. 10.â
William Blaylock and Charles Pond, mur
derers, made a desperate attempt to es
cape from the Kansas penitentiary yester
day. During the noon hour they climbed
out of tbe prison coal shaft, 720 feet deep,
by using the brace scantlings, which are
three feet apart and in tho form of a
ladder. Tne scantlings were wet and
slippery, and the prison officials and
miners never believed such a feat to be
possible. While coming up the coal
cages passed, and the prisoners saved
tbemselves by getting on the air-*hait
side.
On gaining the outside of the prison
wall the tower guards saw them, called on
them to halt and opened fire on tiiem
when they refused. Eight shots were
fared and each man was hit twice and fell
each time. Pond arose tbe third time and
managed to gain tbe woods. He is still at
large. BlaylocK was shot through the left
thigh and the abdomen and is totally
wounded. Blaylock and his brother Jona
than were train-robbers, and in May, 1888,
shot and instantly Killed City Marshal
David Gordon of Columbus, Kans. They
were captured after a hard tight and sen
tenced for life.
Charles Pond is under sentence of death
for murdering his wife at Galena in May,
1891. He was about to oe pardoned, the
State Board naving completed a favorable
investigation of his case.
FATALITY IN A FAMILY
Series of Shootings Followed by
the Mysterious Wounding
of a Wife.
William Eecatur Hale and His Spouse
Found Locked in a Mortal
Embrace.
CAMDEN, N. J., Sept. 10.â The strange
fatality that overhangs the Peak family
was shown last night when William
Decatur Hale, who six months ago mar
ried Minnie Peak, shot her and then him
self. The wife may die.
Barclay Peak, Minnie'B brother, lOyears
old, shot and killed his cousin Mary and
is now serving a twenty years' sentence.
Annie Peak, Minnie's sister, was mur
dered three years ago by her common law
husband, Wesley Warner, who was
hanged.
Hale ye?terday, although ont of work,
pure ased a revolver and, he says, a vio
lin. He and his wife had supper and
drank a kettle of beer. Both say that he
took tbe revolver apart and was putting it
together again when it was discharged.
The wife was sitting opposite to him at
the table ami the bullet struck her and
went through a lung. He then put the
pistol tD liis own head and fired. A neigh
bor broke in and found Hale with his
head bleeding and his wife in his arras
moaning.
"Minnie, darling, I didn't mean to shoot
you," he was saying.
"No, Will, I know you did not," the
wife gasped and lapsed into unconscious
ness.
Both were then taken to the Cooper Hos
pital, where she revived long enough to
make an ante-morteru statement. No sat
isfactory explanation has been made to
the police as to who bought the revolver.
Hale uj) to last Monday was employed as
a bat'gage porter by the West Jer-ev and
Seashore Railroad. He was then laid off,
with fifty others, on account of the end oi
the summer. He had no prospects of
work and the house contains only a couple
of chairs and a table. There is betiding
on trie floor but no bed. Why he should
hayÂ« spent his last money for a revolver
and violin is not understood. He is under
police surveillance at the hospital.
BYCYCLES IN THE MOUNTAINS.
Practicability of the Wheel for Military
Purposes Prorea.
HELENA, Mont., 10. â The
Twenty-fiith Infantry bicycle corps, com
manded by Lieutenant Moss, hes reached
Helena from Fort Yellowstone. The dis
tance between the two posts was covered
in twenty-seven hours. Lieutenant Moss
and his men left Fort Missoula twenty
two days ago, and have covered 1100 miles
in mountainous country. It is the first
Rockies, througn tbe National Part. The
object of the trip was to test the bicycle in
mountainous country. It is the first prac
tical test of the wheel for military purposes
ever made. On that account the trip has
ranch significance, and has been waicneu
with interest by men in the army.
The trip has proved the entire practica
bility of the bicycle for military purposes
over such roads as are usually found in a
mountainous country. Lieutenant Moss
said:
"This is the first real test ever made
with tiie bicycle as a machine for military
purposes. Oa several occasions one officer
and one or two privates have made runs
to see how fast they could go. Those were
tests of rapidity; oars is a test of durabil
ity. The party was not made up of expert

LIVELY TIMES AT
A CONVENTION
Democrats cf Pennsylvania
Are Not in Perfect
Harmony.
TWO CAUSES OF DISCORD
One a Protest Against Resolu
tions and the O.her an At
tack en Harrity.
BUT BRYANI3M IS INDORSED.
Vacancies on the Ticket Caused by
the Resignation o! Candidates
Are Filird
HARRISBURG, Pa., Bept. 10. â The
Democratic State Convention this morn
ing reconvened with the purpose of filling
tbe vacancies on the ticket caused by the
resignation of tbe candidates since the
adoption of the CDicago platform. Chair
man Keenan, in a ringing speech, de
nounced the gold Democratic movement.
When the convention assembled this
afternoon the temporary organization was
made permanent. Tue resolutions reported
a platform indorsing Bryan and bewail;
accepting and heartily indorsing the
Chicago platform, "particularly tiiat plank
in favor of free coinage." and affirming a
belief that tbe election of Bryan will em
phasize the fact that "a Government of
the people, by the people and for the
people sball not perish from the earth."
Robert F. James started to read a pro
test against the resolutions. It was
framed by the gold Democrats. Mr. James
had spoken but a few words when there
were loud cries of "Shut him off," "He's a
friend of McKinley," and like remarks.
The delegates were soon in a turmoil and
Permanent Chairman Koenan and State
Chairman Gorman tried in vain for ten
minutes to restore order. Throughout
the disorder Mr. James stood unmoved.
Finally the delegates became partially
quiet and Mr. Jnnies proceeded.
When he had spoken a few words, how
ever, the delegates again broke out. Mr.
James did not cease, but his voice could
not be beard.
The convention cheered for Bryan while
Mr. James was talking and the scene was
one of wild disorder.
D. C. Dewitt of Towanda appealed to
the delegates to hear Mr. James, and then
the convention, upon motion of Magis
trate Hughes of Philadelphia, decided that
all speeches pertaining to the platform be
limned to fire minutes.
Mr. James again proceeded, and he was
given some attention. The document,
which is a lengthy one, speaks for '-those
members of the AUentown convention,con
stituting a large proportion of that body,
who refuse to surrender Democra tic'prin
cinles or to accept the substituted hereves
of Populism." It denies the right of this
convention to change a line of the "sound
Democratic doctrine proclaimed at Allen
town by the authorized convention of our
party," and protests against "the unlaw
ful organization of this body in violation
of party rules' 1 and its arbitrary action
in unseatine lawful delegates for "the
offense of fidelity to Democratic princi
ples." The declarations of the Chicago
convention are dec:areJ to be "unpatri
otic, vicious and un-Democratic. "
The protest was signed by a committee
of twenty gold Democrats. Thomas F.
Eraraens, also of Northampton, then ad
dressed the convention and declared that
Mr. James d'd not reprpsent the Democ
racy of that county. Judge Dewitt also
criticized Mr. Janr s' remarks.
The majority resolutions were then
adopted by a vote intermingled witti
cheers.
Ex-Congressman W. H. Sowden of Al
entown next offered a resolution to oust
.Mr. Harrity as the Pennsylvania National
committeeman.
The introduction of this resolution cre
ated another exciting scene. An aye and
noe vote was finally taken, which resulted
in 171 ayes and IC7 noes, and the resolu
tion was tabled and thus killed.
The report of the committee which con
ferred with the People's party on the
question of fusion, and which recom
mended the acceptance of the Populists'
offer, was read by Judge Dewitt and
adopted.
The nominations made are as follows:
Judye D. C. Dewitt of Bradford County
and J. T. Ailman of Juniata County, Con
gressmen at large, to succeed Ben C. Potts
of Media and John M. braden of Wash
ington, resigned ; Thomas Sterrell of Erie,
Louis N. Ireland of Allegheny and Thomas
G. Delehanty of Philadelphia for electors
at large, to succeed Jamas Denton Han
cock of Franklin, G. W. Guthrie ot Pitta
burg and W. M. Singerly of Philadelphia,
resigned.
The" vacancies caused by the resigna
tions of a number of district electors were
also filled.
JOHJ*soy>s WILD CLAIMS.
Says That the Hn/an Sentttnent Is
Rapidly Spreading.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 10. âJ. G.
Johnson of Kansas, a member of the
Democratic National Executive Com
mittee, returned to Chicago to-day from a
two weeks' tour through Minnesota, the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, Kan
sas and other Western States. He said :
"Minnesota will go for Bryan beyond
doubt. Even tbe leading Republicans of
that State privately concede the election
of Mr. Liud, the silver fusion candidate
for Governor. From all thai I could learn
Mr. Bryan will not run behind the State
ticket, and I am confident he will carry
the State by a good majority. Tbe Demo
crats, Populists and Silver Republicans
arÂ« thoroughly united and are working
with a will."
Mr. Johnson added that the Bryan sen
timent in the Dakotas, Nebraska, Utah
and Colorado was so strong that it was
only a question of majorities. He made
the sweeping assertion that the Democrats
would carry every Western State by over
whelming majorities and Kansas would
give not less than 20.000 majority for
Bryan. Mr. Johnson will remain at head
quarters lor the remainder of the cam
paign.
Chairman Campau of tbe campaign
committee said the private advices which
he had received from Michipan indicated
the free silver tide was rising in that
State at a tremendous rate and pointed to
a big majority for Bryan. In Gratiot
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, ' FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1896.
County, which had a normal Republican
majority of 2000. a poll just completed
has shown that Bryan will carry it by
1200 majority. Mr. Campau said the Pop
ulists and Prohibitionists were solid for
Bryan, while 000 Eebublicans in that
county were actively supporting the
fusion ticket. He counted Michigan safe
for Bryan.
A letter from John S. Bronk, chairman
of the Democratic county committee of
Rochester, N. V., states the siiver senti
ment among the farmers and workinÃmen
in that part of the State is simply amaz
ing. He adds: "In one township thirty
representative men of this county who
were formerly Republicans will vote for
Bryan, while in the adjoining townships
the silver Republicans are still more nu
merous."
A German department has been added
to the headquarters, Felix Senff, a local
German newspaperman, being placed in
charge. Clubs are being organized in
Chicago and throughout the West by

"You are regarded by the members of
that association," he said, "as tbe man of
America who stands for America and
American institutions, and we greet you
in behalf of the members of this associa

citizens you, sir, will surely win. [Cheers.]
As American citizens, representing no

promise you our support."
Mr. Bryan, in reply, said: "lam very
glad to meet you, gentlemen. I only re

repiesentatives of an occupation ttiat re

FUSION IN COLORADO.
Committees Frnm Four Parties Spend a
I>au in Conference.
DENVER, Colo.. Sept 10.â Th* Siiver
Republican convention completed its
labors to-day by naming a full State ticket
and appointing a conference committee
with full power to dispose of the candi
dates upon a fusion ticket.
The fusion conference of committees
from the four parties has been in session
all day, but nothing has been done. A test
vote on Governor failed to secure a major
ity of the conference for any candidate
though a tie vote was recorded for Adams
(Dem.). The delay hinges on the guberna
torial nomination. The conventions have
all indorsed tbe Bryan and Sewull electors
nominated by the Democrats, makiiiir the
fusion absolutely certain, but a failure to
set up a fusion State ticket will be the
probable outcome of the conference to-day.
Tne ticket named by the silver Republi
cans is as follows: For Governor, J. L.
Brush of Greeley; for Lieutenant-Gov
ernor, Simon Guegenheiru of Denver; for
Secretary of State, Harry Â£. Mulnix of
Trinidad; for State Treasurer, G. W. Kep
nart of Durango; for State Auditor. John

General, Byron L. Carr of Boulder; for
Superintendent of Public Instruction, M.

ERIE, Kanb., SoDt. 10.â Thomas E.Wat,
son, Vice-Presidential candidate, spoke
here to-day to an audience of 2000 people.
He began by reviewing the history of the
People's party from its inception," saying
that the West and South, the great agri
cultural sectious of the country, had
joined hands in the great work of securing
the rights of the people. Then he made
an appeal to voters to stand by the Popu
list party until the corporations had ail
been downed. Referring to Sewall'g can
didacy he was exceedingly bitter, saying:
"I will come off the ticket when my boy
gets out and makes speeches against me,
as Sewall's boy is making speeches against
him. A man who c&nnot carry his own
family carries no political strengtn. Our
people would not consent to my coming
off the ticket. I say that lam not here to
be run off the ticket. 1 would not take an
electoral vote that should not be given to
Bryan, too."
He concluded by saying that come weal
or come woe, he was for William J. Bryan,
and ttiat four years hence he would be
found as nowâ fighting for the People's
party and its integrity. He left the city
for lola, Kans., where he Bjpeaks to
morrow.

on the Question of
Currency.
PROSPERITY IN THE PAST
Due to Sound Money Worth One
Hundred Cents on the
Dollar.
LESSONS OF THE GREENBACKS.
Great Temptation to Flood the Conn
try With a Harmful Circulation
Withstood.
PORTLAND, "feu, Sept. 10. â Hon.
Thomas B. Heed closed the campaign
nere at an immense meeting at tbe City
Hall to-night. Mr. Reed's voice was in
excellent form, and he held the audience
interested until the close of his speech.
In discussing the currency question he
said:
"I remember another time when I was
before an audience like this In this place
We had gonÂ» on in our career of pros
perity from 1868 to 1873; enterprises had
been spread all over the country; more
miles of railroad had been built every year
than were ever built all the world over
since the beginning of time. We out
stripped our own pace, and in 1873 there
came a crash.
"Then we attempted to get out of our
trouble, and it was a very serious trouble,
Decause we had a currency that had its
fouidation in the faith of the people in
the payment by the Government some
time or other.
We had every temptation then to
listen to the men who .-aid to us 'lssue
more greenbacks, let us have larger cur
rency and then we will go forward.' The
temptation was great. We were suffering
from the slow depreciation which resulted
from lifting greenbacks from 60 cents on
a dollar to 100 cents on a dollar. It would
have been a great blessing to some oi us
who were carrying debts at the time if this
could have been an issue, and a great com
fort to some of us, but we resisted the
temptation.
"We said, 'When the United States says
this is a dollar and they are big enough to
make it a dollar, just that moment it
ought to be a dollar, and sball be.' And
what was our reward? It was fourteen
years of the most mad prosperity that the
sun ever shone upon.
"From 1879 to 1892 the United States
was great in wealth, dignity and honor.
I say to you that if ever a nation could see
from its own experience that it pays to be
hones: it is the United States of America.
The experience of the world has proven to
us beyond peradveiUure ihat the attempt
to issue government money every time a
speculative period has set in and burst
means destruction and ruin out of which
there is no way except bankruptcy. Now
we have got to learn that it is not wise to
lower the currency one-half in order to
eke out a speculation. I tnink we shall
.earn it. 1 '

MADE A WORLD'S RECORD
Fastest Mile Ever Paced in a
Race Negotiated by John
R. Gentry.
He Beat Star Pointer Only a Few
Inches for a $5000 Parse
in 2:01 1-2
GLENS FALLS, N. V., Sept. 10. â A
perfect day and last track drew a crowd oi
8000 persons to tbe racecourse to-day.
The event of the card was the match race
between John R. Gentry and Star
Pointer. The race from start to finish
was of the closest an 1 most exciting sort,
and when after the second heat, which
Gentry won by a short head, the time,
2:01%, was marked up and it was realized
that the world's record was broken, the
spectators madly cheered the king of
pacer 3 and his driver, Andrews.
Before the first beat betting was two to
five against Gentry. They got away from
the second score, Star Poinier at the pole.
He led to the homestretch, when Gentry
slowly forged ahead, inch by inch, and
won the fiist heat by a nose. Time by
quarters. 31^-1:03^â1:35â2:03^.
In the second neat the excitement cul
minated. The horses got away on the first
score and went around the tracit neck and
neck, with the precision of machines,
neither gaining nor losing, in the breath
less s lence of the crowd. Just before
reaching the wife Gentry made another
macnifioent spurt and won by a neck,
amid wild enthusiasm. The time by quar
ters was: :31, 1:02, 1:32, 2:01%, the" last
eighth being the fastest ever paced.
The announcement wan received with
renewed cheers by the crowd, which was
beside itself with enthusiasm.
The victory was no less a credit to Star
Pointer, who gained on his previous rec
ord more than did Gentry. The climax
was over with this heat. The horses were
tired, and the race seemed, by tacit agree
ment, to belong to Gentry, who won the
third easily by a length. Time, 2:05%.
. Andrews drove Gentry and Clary ban
died the reins over Star Pointer. Tne race
was for a $5000 purse, and the Breeders'
Association of this place offered $500 extra
if the world's record was broken.

he went to recruit his health. He is
suffering from pneumonia, and bis phy
sicians assert that if he takes a year's rest
in a mild climate he will recover com
pletely, whereas, if he .remains in office
he cannot live more than a few niontns.
Count Inouye resolutely refuses to accept
the portfolio, and there remains only
Count Okuma, a man oi universally recog
nized competence, but so strongly allied
with the extreme wing of tbe opposition
that his entry into the Cabinet would put
an end to the alliance now existing be
tween the latter and the Liberal party, by
whose support the Government was able
to carry their measures through the Diet
last session.
The Department of FinanceJ also greatly
needs an abler statesman than its present
chief. The man pre-eminently ntted for
that post is Count Matsukata, but he will
not come into office unless he has Count
Okuma'a assistance in foreign affairs.
Hence the situation virtually resolves it
self into the transfer of administrative
power to the opposition, which appar
ently involves the old dilemma, a Cabinet
without a majority in the Diet. The Jap
anese, how ever.are past masters in the art
of compromise. It is quite possible that
some easy exit may yet be found from the
dilemma.
A new link between Russia and China
has been forced by the arrangement that
the steamers of the Russian volunteer
fl et, rlying between Odessa and Vladi
vostock, shall henceforth call at Shanghai.
There are twelve of these steamers, and,
excluding tue Habarousk. a vessel of only
2500 tons, they range from 7876 to 10,500
ton?, their speed varying from 13 to 19
knots.
The constant passage of such vessels to
and fro between European Russia and her
most extreme post in tbe far .East suggests
the ease with which she could gradually
muster a strong military force at Vladivo
stock, were she so disposed. At the same
time, experts are well aware that Russia's
naval strength in the Orient is greatly
overestimated by the general public. She
has, it is true, a squadron, powerful In
number of ships, displacement and weight
of armor and armament. But among all
her cruisers in Japanese and Chinese
waters one only carries quick-firing guns,
and the significance of that fact is not to
be underrated. Besides, her vessels never
maneuver together. The British admiral
is perpetually exercising ten or a dozen
ships in squadron, but his Russian con
frere makes no such effort, and it is more
than probable that this radical difference
of training would tell markedly in war
fare.
A subscription has been started in Japan
for the relief of Formosans rendered home
less by the recent rebellion. The Em
peror and Empress set the example by
subscribing 3000 yen ; the treasury gave
40,000 and private subscriptions are rapidly
coming into the newspaper offices. It
has always been the habit of Chinese in
surgents or disbanded soldiers to burn,
pillage and murder, and many excesses of
that nature perpetrated by the Formosan
rebels have been laid at the door of the
Japanese. As for the rebellion, it is now
virtually stamped out, though desultory
raids continue to be made by little bauds
of desperadoes.
Particulars of the wreck of the German
gunboat litis showt hat she was lost, not,
as was originally reported, hecause of tbe
incapacity of her engines to save her from
drifting on a lee shore, but through
striking on a rock while hugging the coast
at night during a heavy gale. The en
gines were working well at the time, but
the vessel seems to have been caught by
an extraordinary current and carried out
of her course. The last scene on board
was (splendid. The captain summoned
the crew aft as the ship was beginning to
break up and called upon them to give
three cheers for the Kai?er, which they
did most lustily. They then sane the
Flagglied hymn, and were actually sing
ing when tne Iltis parted amidships. The
few survivors that clung to the forward
portion were rescued by a Chinese boat
after thirty-six hours' exposure.

SOME PREMATURE SPECULATION
Men Who Are Mentioned for Port
folios in the Event of the
Nebraskan's Election.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Sept. 10.â The
telegram of Secretary Lamont in which
he announces his intention to vote for
Palmer and Buckner, the Presidential
candidates of the Indianapolis ticket, and
denounces the "new and strange creed
proclaimed in a moment of delirium at
Chicago," is expected to be followed
shortly by a letter or telegram from Presi
dent Cleveland. It is said that Mr. Cleve
land indicated his purpose some days ago
of making a public expression indorsing
the action of the Indianapolis convention.
Secretary Lamont's open avowal of his
attitude sets at rest any doubt as to his
position and, incidentally, vindicates the
prediction made In these dispatches when
the Secretary returned from his visit to
Gray Gables that the master of the White
House would yet bring every recalcitrant
member of his Cabinet into line against
the Chicago ticket.
Mr. Carlisle, for instance, who told
Senator Lindsay of Kentucky before his
visit to Gray Gables that he would vote the
Democratic ticket, recently expressed him
self very strongly in favor of the Indian
apolis ticket. It is curious that the gentle
men deepest interested in this movement
cannot succeed in forcing upon the people
the name which they adopted for their
party, namely, the "National Democratic
party." Every man, no matter what be
his sentiments toward the Chicago plat
form, recognizes that the ticket nomi
nated there is that of the National Demo
cratic party, and the sound-money Demo
crats are in very grave danger of passing
down into history without any name at
tached to their movement except that of
the city where their convention was Held.
The sound-money men will open their
campaign on the Ist of next month. They
will have no literary bureau to speak of,
because their activity will be confined sole
ly to sending oat able speakers, whose
only topic will be the danger of the free
silver heresy. The literature which they
would send is already being supplied more
systematically and far more liberally by |
the National Republican committee than I
the sound-money men could hope to do.
There will be perfect harmony of action,
and the sound-money sp akers will be
careful to arrange all their itineraries in
such a way as to co-operate with the
speakers' bureau of the Republicans.
There will be no attempt made by the
sound-money men to dictate the action of
any State committee in the matter of put
ting up an electoral ticket. It is conceded
that the sound-money men everywhere
have only one purpose in view, the elec
tion of McKinley, and it will be left to
their discretion everywhere to run an in
dependent electoral ticket or to place the
State electors for McKinley under the
Palmer and Buckner party emblem.
Thus, men like Representative John K.
Cowen of Baltimore, E. J. Phelps of Ver
mont and Bourke Cochran of New York,
who beliove that a McKinley vote is the
most sensible and straightforward way of
defeating Bryan, will be cheerfully sup
ported in this work. It is generally under
stood that in almost every State the
sound-money men will, a day or two be
fore the National election, practically
abandon their own ticket and throw their
votes to McKinley and vote for the sound
money candidate for Congress, no matter
what are his party affiliations.
At Democratic headquarters the action
of Mr. Lamontis discounted by the asser
tion that Senator Hill will undoubtedly
come out for the Democratic ticket after
the convention at Buffalo next Wednes
day, notwithstanding his telegram of to
day to the county chairman at Albany.
Hill's telegram puzzles the politicians !
somewha,t, i>ut they take it to mean that
he refuses to be bound by instructions.
The general opinion is that he will yet an
nounce himself for Bryan.
His inconsistent action in advocating
what he fought so bitterly at Chicago is
ingeniously explained away by his friends
at the headquarters. Mr. Hill, they say,
went to Chicago as the representative of
his party in New York, carrying, as it
were, a power of attorney from them. He
made his right and was defeated.
If next Wednesday the representatives
of the Democratic party in New York, j
whose attorney he was in Chicago, decide
upon a new course, then Mr. Hill, the
faithful attorney of his party, will be
guided by their new orders. It is believed
at the Democratic headquarters in allserl
ousne&s that Bryan has more than a fight
ing chance in New York. This is not the
idle campaign claim of the shouters about
the headquarters, but is the calm judg
ment of the men who do not as a rule give
out campaign interviews.
Senator Gorman, who spent nearly two
weeks at Saratoga studying up the politi
cal situation in New Yoik, is said to be
fully convinced that Bryan will come
down to the Harlem running very little
behind McKinley, if not passing him, and
if Tammany only does its duty New York
will be in tiie Democratic column. Cer
tain it is that this claim was never made
for New York until the recent visit to the
National headquarters of Senator Gorman.
And it is believed that Senator Gorman
is authority for the firm faith in Mr. Hill.
There is such an amount of assurance
that Mr. Hill will come out for Bryan and
that New York can be carried for Bryan
with proper effort that it is already said at
headquarters that Hill will be made Secre
tary of State "in case Bryan wins."
The rest of the Cabinet has not yet been
entirely parceled out by enthusiastic Dem
ocrats, but at present ex-Governor Hogg
of Texas, who is now at the New York
headquarters, is spoken of as the Attorney-
General; Governor Stone of Missouri is
slated for the Secretaryship of the Inte
rior, thus succeeding his Missouri rival in
politics, ex-Governor Francis ; George Fred
Williams of Massachusetts is to be the
Secretary of the Navy, so that Newport
and "society" generally Is to have a kid
glove representative in the Cabinet. The
treasury is to go to Senator Teller, because
Mr. Bland, whose name naturally suggests
itself for that office in case free silver wins,
intends to be Speaker of the House of Rep
resentatives.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Sept. 10.â After

Men, the committee's report, recommend
ing that the ritual be printed only in Eng

the order is a distinctively American one.

LEADVIULE, Colo., Sept. 10.â A party
of union miners attacked several non

of a serious nature. This scrimmage is
the only foundation for the reports sent

but business for a year has been poor.
BOURKE COCKBAN'S STAND
Cannot Accept a Congressional
Nomination From New York
Republicans. . ,
Will Vote for McKinley in November,
but Is Not Prepared to Leave
His Party.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept 10â Bourke
Cockran has declined the nomination for
Congress offered to him by the Republi
cans of the Twelfth District. In his letter
of declination he says:
The assault led by Bryan on American honor
and industry is fraught with such danger to
tne country that I snail vote ior Major McKin
ley as the n.ost effective method by which 1 can
aid in preventing its success. I could not,
however, accept any nomination during this
campaign to any office nowever exalted for
which I would be indebted to the political
organization whose candidate I am compelled
to support by the exigencies of a grave National
peril but to whose distinctive principles I am
oppf^ed.
while the Democratic organization remains
a party to the Populist conspiracy against
wages I shall labor untiringly tor its defeat, but
I will not consent to profit by its overthrow.
The faithless leaders who have betrayed the
Democratic Convention to the Populists de
serve a crushing rebuke at the polls and I am
anxious to join in administering it to them,
but I am resolved to share the exclusion from
office which I shall urge the people to impose
on my party.
LOS ANGELES REDDING.
HUH am West and Mitttt Helen Ball Made
Man and Wife.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 10.â This
evening Miss Helen Ball, daughter of
Captain and Mrs. C. J. Ball, was married
to William West of this city. The wed
ding took place at the residence of the
bride on West Adams street and was a
very interesting affair, over 200 invita
tions being issued.
The ceremony took place in the large
drawing-room, under a crowd of white
carnations and smilax. The bride was
led to the altar by her father, who gave
her away. Miss Hattie Kimball of Oak
land was the maid of honor. Miss Lillian
Wellborn and Miss Mac Newton were
bridesmaids; the best man was Dee Sale
and the groomsmen were George Stamm,
George Larence, Fred and Horace Hen
derson.
The little ribbon- bearers were Thomas
Creighton and Athlene English. The
music was under the direction of Pro
fessor Krauss, the violinist, and there
were also selections of vocal and instru
mental music by Mr. Zinck, tenor, and
Miss Delphine Todd, soprano. The cere
mony was performed by Rev. A. S. Clark
of Christ Church.
SEIZED SKALEE AT VICTORIA.
Captain Brown of the Aurora Seem* to
Have Been Vntueky.
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 10.â The seal
ing schooner Aurora, Captain Thomas
Brown, arrived to-day from Bering Sea,
where she was seized by the United States
revenue cutter Rush on August 10 for
having aboard three skins bearing sup
posed marks of a shotgun.
These pelts have been kept separate
from the others secured by the sealer, and
when the schooner was overhauled Cap
tain Brown drew special attention to
them. He was unfortunate, however, in
not having landed all his guns and am
munition at Atu before entering the sea
and thus avoiding suspicion.
Had|he observed this optional formality
there could have been no excuse for the
seizure, for Captain Brown firmly con
tends that the holes in the skins were
made by a spear. After the seizure a prize
crew was placed aboard the Aurora, and
she was sent to Unaiaska. Here she re
ported to her Majesty's steamship Icarius
and was ordered home.
GEORGE E. KhItCKHOFF DEI ID

wise taking an active part in the adminis
tration of its business. He was extensively
interested in real estate transactions and
various other business enterprises. Mr.

The Al-Ki Overdue From Juneau.
BEATTLE, Wash.. Sept. 10.â The Pa
cific Coast Steamship Compauy's steamer
Al-Ki, running on the Alaska route, is
three days overdue from Juneau. Some
anxiety is felt in this city for the safety of
the vessel, but the company's agents *say
there is no occasion for alarm, as she has
probably been greatly retarded in her
progress owing to the unusually dense
fogs. The AI-Ki was to have sailed to-day
from this port on her return trip.

IN CONFERENCE
Second Day's Session of
Methodists at Pacific
Grove.
ELDERS MAKE REPORTS
San Francisco Said to Be a
Wicked City, but Not So Bad

MANY M'KINLEY ADHERENTS.
Scheme of a Reverend Gentleman to
Rehabilitate the Politics of
the Country.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Sept. 10.â
After the usual early morning prayer
meeting, at which the attendance is grow
ing, the second day's session of the Cali-
Scene at the California Annual Conference of the MethodLt Ep'scopal Church, Now Being Held in
the Methodist Church at Pacific Grove.
fornia conference convened at 8:30 o'clock.
The congregation was larger than on the
previous day. Opening devotional exer
cises were conducted by Rev. Alfred Kum
mer of Oakland, He read a scripture
lesson and led in a powerful prayer. A
number of other clergymen also made
feeling prayers, and all invoked a special
blessing on the conference and the im
portant work before it.
At 9 o'clock Bishop Foss took the chair
and presided until the noon recess. He
remarked that the Methodist Episcopal
church is the only body of its kind which
annually inquires into the personal char
acter of its ministers.
Following this statement there were
numerous and fervent "Amens." In this
connection it is gratifying to the confer
ence, though nothing out of the usual or
der, that there is not a charge of any
Kind against any member. Rev. F.
A. McFaul of Lockeford resigned during
the year because he could no longer accept
the doctrine of the trinity.
As the names were called this morning
the ministers in several districts reported
the amount of money collected during
the year for missionary work and confer
ence claimants. The reports were quite
gratifying. They show an increased in
terest in the work. The amounts were
taken down by statistical secretaries, who
when all the reports are in, will make the
footings and report the result to the con
ference.
The presiding elders, too, were called on
for their annual reports oi the work in
their respective district*. Those were
very complete and extensive, and sub
joined are extracts made from as many as
reported this morning.
The reports were listened to with great
interest by the entire congregation, and
reports of good work in any field were
enthusiastically approved in the nsual
manner.
A complaint by letter against the min
Rev. A. H. Needham, Secretary of the California Annual Conference
at Pacific Grove, and Pastor of Pacific Grove Methodist Church.
ister at Smith River by a saloon-keeper
was read and humorously regarded by the
conference. The saloon-keeper said he
wanted a minister who was not so hot
against saloons.
The matter of the organization of the
district missionary societies then came up.
The general Methodist Conference at its
last session arranged for the appointment
in each presiding eider's district of a dis
trict secretary, whose duty shall be to
work up interest in missions. The matter
of the manner of the appointment of this
committee was referred to :i committee.
The only sign that the conference showed
of entering into a spirited debate to-day
was on the action of the general confer
ence in admitting women to its member
ship and the question of what action the
California conference should take subse
quent to it.
Parliamentary tactics prevented a pro
tracted and very spirited debate, as the
conference is understood to differ on the
matter. The action of the general con
ference as to the admission of ministers
and laymen to equal representation also
brought out practically the same situation.
A motion by Rev. Mr. Antnony, to take
up the matter to-morrow morning with
out debate, finally prevailed, though there
â was some outspoken objection to shutting
off the ritrht of free speech. The matter
of accepting by the conference the under
graduates from accredited literary and
theological schools was referred to a com
mittee composed of Reverends M. D. Buck,
J. W. Ross and W. B. Urmy.
After the transaction of a few formal
matters the regular session of the con
ference adjourned, and the auditorium
was occupied in the afternoon by auxil
iary meeting.
At 2:30 o'clock Mrs. Alfred Kummer
presided at the meeting of the Wom'an's
Foreign Missionary Society in the audi
torium. The scripture lesson was read by
Mrs. C. C. Lombard. Rev. Mr. Osborn led
in prayer.
The'first talk of the afternoon was made
by Mrs. R. S. Cantine on "Medical Mis
sionaries." She said her talk would be
chiefly about the women medical mission
ary, and referred to Dr. Carrie Swain of
New York, who made many converts in
India and became ianious throughout
that foreign land when the strictly relig
ious missionary made little progress.
At first the medical missionaries, by
reason of their knowledge of the healing
art, made much more progress. English
physicians cannot be admitted to the room
of a woman in India, except a woman of
the street, and on this account the women
of India have suffered untold pain. She
gave several instances where the Gospel
had found an entering wedge in foreign
lands through a Christian physician hav
ing traveled and cured a dignitary and
m:i'le a way for it.
Mrs. Lucy Drake Osborn, a missionary
late of India, entertained the audience
with a talk on that country. She said that
the great majority of the population of
India is on the verge of starvation, except
for six weeks of the year during the mango
season. They carry starved children
around and keep them starved in order to
better get alms. Regularly organized
missions are doing the best missionary
work in India.
A collection was taken up, and the
meeting concluded with the singing of
several songs in Mahrattee and Hindus
tanee by Mrs. Osborn.
Following tti* 1 missionary meeting was
a Pentecostal meeting of song, prayer and
praise, led by Rev. Mr. Bain. He awak
enea a wonderful religious spirit. Mem
bers of the congregation kneeling at the
chancel and responding with fervent
amens to the preacher's praying macie one
of the most impressive scenes of the con
ference, and certainly the most impressive
of tho second day.
The concluding rueetinc of the afternoon
was that of the Ladies' Aia Society. No
business was transacted except the ap
pointment of n committee to make nom
inations for officers to be elected at the an
nual meeting of the society next Saturday
afternoon.
The meeting wns called principally for
the purpose of making arrangements for a
reception to the wives of the ministers,
to be >_-iven in El Carmeio Hotel on Satur
day eveninc
Bishop Foss is holding daily cabinet
meetings with the presiding elders. At
his reauest Rev. M. H. Alexander, D.D.,
was appointed assistant statistical secre
tary in place of Rev. W. C. Kurnow, who
is not present at the conference.
Several ministers wear McKinley but
tons in their coat lapels, but not a Bryan
button is seen. One of the secretaries said
he thought that a large majority of the
conference members were for McKinley.
This evening the Sabbath observance
anniversary was held, a fine audience being
present. Rev. Dr. M. C. Briggsof San Jose,
who travels in the interest of Sabbath ob
servance, presided and delivered the prin
cipal address. He spoke of the need of a
Sabbath for laboring people, a Sabbath for
rest and home life.
Rev. John Stephens of Simpson Mem
orial Church, San Francisco, made an
address in which he said that he did not
want a return to the blue laws, but did
want a greater observance of the Sabbath.
Rev. Dr. W. R. Goodwin of the Cali
fornia-street Methodist Church, San Fran
cisco, spoke. He said if bicycles brought
people to church he would call on the
Lord to bless them, but if they did not he
might feel more like calling on the Lord
to do the ether thing. He added that
San Francisco had all the vices of Sodom
and Gomorrah, and felt that the good
people in the City were the salvation of it
from tuewrath of God. He said he would
like to have God President of the United
States for one term, Jesus Christ Secretary
of the Treasury and some preachers in
Congress, and then the industrial, the
Sunaay and the financial questions would
be settled.
He said there is gold and silver enough
in this country, but what was needed is a
better way of using it. He said there
ought to be a little more morality about it.
Henry J. McCoy of San Francisco, gen
eneral secretary of the Young Men's
Christian Association, who is attending
the conference, donned bis bicycle suit
this morning and went out for a spin.
He rode along the sidewalk, being igno
rant of the fact that there is a Pacific
Grove ordinance against it, and was
promptly arrested by City Marshal Rich.
Subsequently the matter was dropped.
Presiding Elder E. R. Willis of the
Naps district reported that hard times had
affected both salaries and collections. He
said :
'â¢The word Vallejo is not synonymous
with righteousness. Kins Alcohol is on
the throne. The city stands because there
are more than ten righteous one^ in it. To
see a man at the mourners' bench in Val
lejo would surprise the people more than
an earthquake.
"I believe that God will capture this
modern Jericho. Brother Woodward's
work has been chiefly confined to leading
the people into higher religious experi
ences.
"Benicia," he said, "is the same kind of
soil that is found at Vallejo and the same
conditions prevail. They have paid off a
large portion of the church debt.
"At Vacaville there was not a tent a year
ago, but now there is a chapei free from
debt. The church is in Vacaville to stay.
"As to Dixon every saloon-keeper there
would like to see Brother Wa Iker
cremated. This field was like a strong,
vigorous man who had fallen into a de
cline and magnified his feebleness. It has
been largely the mission of the pastor
here, Rev. Mr. Walker, to tell the people
that God is not dead.
"The towns of Madison and Guinda are
a new and promising field. Up to this
year the congregation had to meet in the
schoolhouse, but now it has a chapel of
its own free from debt.
"In .LaKe County, with a population
much scattered, the church property is
improved.
"I am hopeful for a new church at
EureKa. At Yolo and Blacks the church
has been lifted out of obscurity. Brother
Rodda has raised a $500 debt at Ferndale,
and at Woodland the church is strong and
without a discordant note. An effort to
proselyte the church members was foiled.
"Results at Ukiah are growing in ex
tent and the church at Crescent City is
sti oncer than for years.
"To be, or not to be is the question at
San Rafael. If help is not obtained the
Sheriff will get the church there. It would
be a shame for .Methodism to abandon one
of the most important cities near San
Francisco.
"Windsor Church is inadequate to the
present demands. Hydevllle, a long time
dead, has come forth again and wants
preaching this year.'"
The Green Valley debt on the parsonage
had been paid and the next step will be
toward a new church. The debt at Man
chester has been canceled. Petaluma is
one of the most substantial charges and
the outlook for a prosperous year is en
courapring. At Boonville a new church has
been erected.
"Calistoga's year has been one of the
best ii: its history for Methodism. Prog
ress is reported at Ukiah and at nearly all
the remaining charges of the district/
John Kirby, presiding elder of the Oak
land district, which has an area of 15,000
s^uiire miles, reported that upward of half
of the fortyâeven charges are free from
debt. He said:
"Over $7000 of debt on churches and
parsonages has been paid during the past
year. Rev. G. H. Jones of Thirty-fourth
street churoh and Rev. Wallis of Twenty
fourth-street church, Oakland, have raised
considerable of the church debt during
the year. A now parsonage has been built
at Diiuoiid. with a small mortgage of
$1100, but the church is free from debt.
"At Linden the chnrch has been im
proved, and at Coulterville the church has
money in the treasury and the edince is
in cood order.
"The parsonage at Amador has been en
larged. A new church has been built at
Pino and paid for as each nail was driven.
There has been no great revival in the
district, but in several places the revival
fire has burst forth.
"Rev. F. A. MoFaul of the Oakland dis
trict has resigned during the year, havine
abandoned the doctrine of the trinity and
gone into 'logic,' where the song birds
never sing."
F. J. Masters, presiding elder of the Chi
nese district, which extends to all cities of
the. conference, reported that never before
has there been such an interest in San
Francisco Chinntown in the gospel as dur
ing the past confprfiife year.

DETECTIVE WORK
AT SACRAMENTO
The Dead Robber's Compan
ions Believed to Be in
the City.
TWO ARRESTS ARE MADE
One Man Is Turned Loose, the
Other Kept in Strict
SeclusioD.
MUCH MYSTERY AND SECRECY.
Clews, Descriptions and Photographs
That Are Expected to Lead to
Results.
BACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 10. - After
several days' hard work the detective
forces of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company and Wells-Fargo have evidently
arrived at the conclusion that the much
wanted train-robbers whose companion
was killed by Engineer Ingles in last Sat
urday night's attempted hold-up are at
the present time waiting the streets of
this city, trusting to evade detection
among the immense crowd of outsiders
who throng it rather than to maJte any
attempt at escape by any of the carefully
guarded thoroughfares leading to other
localities.
All day long there has been extreme
activity among the rank and file of man
hunters, and at least two arrests have
been made, one of which is rumored to be
importantâ with how much truth it is
impossible to ascertain, as Hume and
Thacker, who are captaining the search,
have sealed the mouths of their subor
dinates.
All that can be learned is that a man
named Mike Golden was arrested this
morning and has since been turned at
liberty, though he is said to be still under
surveillance, and that later a man named
Sullivan was placed under arrest and con
veyed to the County Jail, where he is kept
in strict seclusion. From the impene
trable air of mystery which has been cast
around him it is thought that possibly he
may be one of the trio who made the at
tempt on the company's train. On the
other hand there are companions of this
same man who claim to have been in his
company during the entire night of the
robbery.
That the whole scheme was concocted
in this city by outside talent has been
proven beyond a doubt. The robbery of
the powder magazine and the purchase of
the fuse and caps have both been traced
to the dead man and his companions,
whose actual description is in the posses
sion oi the detectives. Their hanging-out
places while in this city are known and
there is but little doubt that it is a mere
matter of time until their capture is
effected, as it is claimed that the photos
of the two men wanted have been secured.
CAMPEELL'S CASE AT REDWOOD.
Judge Buck Will JVot Hear the Issue In
volving Hiit Fee.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Sept 10.â Â»
Judge Buck will not hear the issue involv
ing the allowance of Attorney Campbell's
fee in the estate of Charles Lux, deceased.
The clerk to-day wrote Governor James H.
Budd requesting him to designate some
other Judge to hear the issues. Conse
auently the case which was set for argu
ment for next Saturday will be continued.
This action was caused by the recent
publication of certain articles in San
Francisco dailies containing reflections of
a serious nature against certain attorneys
in the case.

GREAT ACTIVITY AT SAN LUIS..
Rousing Meeting of the McÃ-inley and
Hobart Club.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., Sept. 10.-
Last evening a rousing meeting of the
McKinley and Hobart Club was held at
their headquarters.
Chairman Fowler presided and made a
few opening remarks. He was followed
by G. W. Kemp, who delivered a half-hour
opeech on the tariff which was warmly
applauded. The club is daily increasing
and using every effort to nave all voters
fall in line for McKinley and Hobart.
The Brvan Club met last night at the
opera-house and an address by C. A.
Barlow, the fusion candidate for this dis
trict, was listened to. The Udell letter to
The Call, in reference to Barlow, is hav
ing a telling effect upon tne community.

equal the effort made by Tiburon, and the
North Pacific Coast Railroad Company is
expected to assist largely. The commit
tee on arrangements will be named this
week.
Chinaman Killed Aear Bakersfield.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Sept. 10. â A
telephone message was received here this
evening from the Fish ranch, twelve miles
west of here, that a Chinaman had been
killed by the falling of a hay derrick mast.
He was a trusted employe and had been in
the employ of Mr. Fish, proprietor of the
ranch, for a number of years.
VALLEJO HAS A SUICIDE.
Richard Willis, a Veteran
Marine, Shoots Himself
Through the Head.
Dismissed From the Yountville Home
for Disobeying Rules, He Suc
cumbs to Despondency.
VALLEJO, Cal., Sept. 10.â Poor, old
and broken down, Richard Willis shoi
and killed himself last night. Ha was the
possessor of three honorable discharges,
more than a dozen small discharges of one
year each, and an autograph letter from
Hon. Gideon Welles, ex-Secretary of the
Navy, for gallant and meritorious conduct
during the several engagements of the
United States ship New Ironsides in the
assaults on Fort Fisher, in December,
1864, and January, 1865, during which en
gagements he was wounded in the legs,
and as a result was in receipt of $36 per
quarter as {tension money.
For twelve or fifteen years past Willis
has Berved as signal quartermaster on the
receiving-ship Independence. About three
years ago he decided to quit the navy and
go to the Veterans' Home at Yountville.
He remained there for a time and having
disobeyed the regulations was discharged,
with the penalty of not being entitled to
admission for six months.
Willis was old and infirm and had been
since subsisting on the small pension re
ceived. He had been stopping in a little
room near the water front, out becoming a
pauper and unable to pay the rent he was
turned out. A neighbor gave him a couple
of nights lodging and again he was left to
drift out into the night, when an old lady
took compassion and offered to share her
humble abode with him. Willis thanked
her and with but 20 cents lefi he asked Her
to have a sup of beer. They drank to
gether in a saloon at the corner of Branci
forte and Capitol streets, when Willis ex
cused himself for a moment and passed
out of the front door into the darkness.
He had not gone twenty feet before
taking a revolver from his pocket, which
he placed to the side of his right ear and
fired, and by the time the inmates of the
saloon had reached him he was dead.
Willis was a native of England, about
80 years of age.

ROYAL RACING AT
THE STATE FAIR
Vinctor and Libertine Fight
Their Battles Over
Again.
TEE CALIFORNIAN WINS.
An Odds-On Favorite Badly Rid*
den by Little Jockey
Frawley.
DISCIPLINE FOR THE RIDER.
E'mwood Stock Farm and El Pri-
mero Stable Horses Capture
Two Races Each.
BACRAMBNTO, Cal., Sept. 10.â This
forenoon at the track was taken up by the
stock parade and the country visitors were
creatly Interested in the magnificent spec
imens of thoroughbred horses and cattle
that were walked around the ring. The
second parade will take place on Saturday,
\t which time the premiums will be
awarded.
In the afternoon a big crowd was in at
tendance to witness the running events.
The Vinctor stake, usually one of the star
attractions of the meet, resulted in a walk
over for the great Californian, Vinctor,
who merely received the entrance money
Ms stable put up. In the race following, a
mile special, he again made the mighty
Libertine bow to him, nosing the Easterner
out in 1 :41, over a track not lightning fast.
Joe Narvaez, the rider of Vinctor, was en
thusiastically cheered for his great saddle
work.
El Primero stable's Caliente, a son of El
Rio Rev, took the Ladies' stake, from a
field of nine, in a romp, starting a 2 to 1
choice. The brown colt Ruinart, carrying
Bookmaker George Rose's colors, proved
himself a smashing good three-year-old
by picking up 112 pounds and defeating
Grady, Installator and Arnette at a mile
and seventy yards, finishing like a real
good one.
Fleur de Lis and Nebuchadnezzar also
picked up purses for their respective own
ers. Many visitors arrived from San
Francisco and Stockton this morning, and
the ring enjoyed about the busiest day of
t'.e meet.
Entered to be sold for $600 and pitted
against an ordinary lot of two-year-old
platers, the opening' five-furlong scramble
looked a pick-up for Flear de Lis. The
books laid 7 to 10 against her, and, shak
ing Dolore off in the stretch, she won
comparatively easily at the end in l:01>Â£.
Dolore, who ran an exceedingly good race,
beat Alazan, a 30 to 1 shot, four lengths
for the place.
A seven and a half furlong run brought
out a field of seven, with John Hum
phreys' mare Chartreuse II opening a pro
nounced 1 to 2 favorite. The "dope"
players considered her a "pipe." Nebuch
adnezzar's great run in the Farewell
handicap decided over the Bay District
track some months ago, when he was
beaten but a head in 2:07 for the mile and
a quarter, was evidently quite forgotten,
for he went begning at 4 to 1. McClain,
who had the mount on the latter, sent
him to the front as the barrier was lifted,
and, leading throughout, he won very
handily, a length and a half before Sea
side, in 1:34 >Â£. The favorite received a
sort of tepid ride at the hands of little
Frawley, for which the lad waa set down
for the meeting.
Ten faced Btarter Havey for the Ladies'
BtÂ«ke, worth $690 to the winning three
year-old. The erratic Peixotto opened a 9
to 5 choice, but when the coin began pour
ing in on Caliente, forcing his price down
from fours to 2 to 1, he receded to 12 to 5.
Heartsease, Lucille and Miss Pollard re
ceived the most support of the other start
ers. Hazlett on Peixotto managed to get
the bad actor away fairly well, and at once
hustled him to the front. He did not ap
pear to have his customary turn of speed,
for as the stretch was reached Lucille and
Caliente were at his side. The latter be
gan pulling away below the paddock,
finally winning easily by two lengths in
l:l4Ji, Miss Pollard made a good run
through the stretch, taking the place by a
length from Lucille.
After Vinctor had galloped around the
track for the Vinctor stake the betting be
gan on the mile special, with Lobengula
112, Vinctor 118, Libertine 116 and Wheel
of Fortune 108 as starters. Vinctor was a
hot favorite in the betting, going to the
post 4to 5. Lobengula at 16 to 5 was well
supported, and Libertine's friends eagerly
cobbled up the 4>Â£ to 1 offered against the
big bay. "The Wheel" was steady at
fours throughout the betting. When the
quartet was dispatched, following his
usual custom, Macklin on Libertine set
sail for the lead, but Narvaez on the favor
ite did not intend to lose him, and soon
had his mount at the crack miler's heels.
Vinctor began forging to the front as
the distance to the wire shortened, and at
the furlong pole had the footing on Liber
tine. Then it seemed as though Narvaez
grew just a trifle over-confident, for Mack
lin, next the rail, suddenly shot Libertine
up to equal terms with Vinctor, and from
the entrance to the saddling paddock a
desperate drive took place, Vinctor get
ting past the mark first by a nose. Loben
gula put in a bold bid less than a furlong
from home, but McGlone used poor judg
ment when he endeavored to squeeze in
between the two leaders and was shut off,
finally finishing a good third.
Another quartet started in the Native
Sons' handicap, over a mile and seventy
yards. Ruinart opened an even money
chance, the books later lengthening this
out to 7 to 5 from force of the coin that
went in on Installation, cutting his odds
from twos to 8 to 5. Grady and Arnette
also came in for quite extemive backing
at more juicy prices. To the far turn the
order was Arnette, Urady, Ruinart and
the second choice. ' Soon after, Freeman,
on Ruinart, apparently satisfied that he
had the two leaders beaten, took his
mount back and let lostallator have third
position. Below the furlong pole he let
out a wrap on Ruinart, and the brown colt,
taking command of things, won galloping
from Grady, in 1:40^, with Installator
third. The latter horse should run better
next time out.

preparations are beinc made for the enter
tainment of the coming Republican
County Convention, which will be held in
this city on Monday, September 21, begin
ning at 10 o'clock. A meeting of those
interested was held to-night and the
matter inlormally talked over.
If the present plan 3 are carried out
Linderman's Opera-house will be used as
the place of meeting, it is large, com
modious and has plenty of rooms in which
the various committees can meet. In ihis
it has an advantage ever Armory Hall,

for the visitors. It is expected that the
work of the convention can be easily ac

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1896.
WORK AND PLAY
AT PALO ALTO
The University Is Filled to
Its Capacity With
Students.
A COURSE OF LECTURES.
Professor Powers to Handle the
Subject of Practical
Politics.
ACTIVIIY AMONG ATHLETES.
Many New Candidates for Football
Honorsâ Musical Clubs Are
Reorganizing.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
10.â The registration of the university
now numbers 908â a very creditable gain
over last year at the same date. Dr. Elliott,
the registrar, says that a registration of
fIOO for the year will be about the mark in
his opinion. Until the estate yields a
greater revenue, permitting the erection of
new structures and increasing laboratory
and classroom facilities, this is the
capacity of the university, and the num
ber of Stanford students will be limited
until that time.
The course offered by Professor Powers
in practical politics seems to be a most
popular one. Fully 300 students are plan
ning to take it Professor Powers in out
lining the course says that he will devote
most of the time to an examination of the
phases of the present campaign as they
arise, and a discussion of the causes lead
ing up to the financial problem. Several
of the campaign orators will deliver ad
dresses to the students of the class, and
altogether the course is to be made as in
teresting and up to date as possible.
All the student organizations are rap
idly getting into running order. Last year
the musical organizations of the university
bad a most successful season, though
financially the long trips were a failure,
This year there is promise of greater com*
petition for places than ever before in the
Mandolin Club, Glee Club, Banjo Club and
orchestra. The Mandolin Club is the first
to get under way, with W. Brittle Wells
as director. Mr. Wells says that there are
over twenty candidates this year for the
club where there were but ten last year,
and some of the new applicants are musi
ciansof merit.
Director Wells is planning to have his
aggregation make weekly trips to neigh
boring towns â Santa Cruz, Salinas, Mon
terey and San Jose being in the listâ and
during the Christmas holidaya the club
may make a trip to Portland and the
Northwest, from which section some very
flattering offers have been made.
The orchestra is planning to reorganize,
and talk of organizing a big Stanford band
is rife. Altogether the prospects are
bright for musical clubs.
Captain Fjckert had his men oat on the
field for an hour this evening, after which
he led them for a mile over the country on
a run. Many new players were out, and
there is certainly no reason why the fiesh
men should not send out a first-rate team
against their Berkeley opponents. The
freshmen intercollegiate game will un
doubtedly take place, so Football Mana
ger Brown says, but the date is yet uncer
tain. Following is a complete list of the
new men up to date and something con
cerning them:
Madden, who played such a fine end on
the Olympic team last year, will try for
that position here this season. He weighs
180 pounds. He is a speedy runner and
sure tackier.
Buntin, a new candidate for guard or
center, is a 200-pounder, who played those
positions on the Orchard Lake team,
which last year met and made a fine
showing against the Michigan University
boys and the Chicago University eleven.
Freeman, the Stanford tennischampion
and a second-year man, is out for football
honors this year. He is a candidate for
fullback and is a good punter. His weight
is 170 pounds.
W. H. Boper '98 is another candidate for
fullback, and at present the finest punter
on the gridiron. Soper made the position
of Kubfuil on the Varsity two years ago,
and Campbell had great faith in his abil
ity to kick, but was less sure of his tackling.
He weigns 170 pounds.
Lanegan, last year's fullback in the
Denver High School eleven, is tryine for
that place here. His weight is 165 pounds.
Diegler is still another candidate for
full, but may go to end or half. He is a
strongly built fellow and played a good
fullback last year for the Palo Alto High
School. His weight is 160 pounds.
Hall 1900. of Placer County, has aspira
tions, and will try for fullback or tackle.
His weight is 167 pounds, and in practice
he punts and drop-kicks very well.
Balleutineof Portland University played
guard last year for his college against the
Butte team, and made a very favorable
showing, though his weight is but 160
pounds. He is trying for end here. Bal
lentine holds a record of 10 feet as a pole
vaulter.
Rusk ia another big man from the
north. He weighs 165 pounds, and is said
to play a fine tackle. He will try for that
place here.
Murphy of Willamette University
played quarterback last year for his uni
versity and made a record for himself.
He weighs 150 pounds. Murphy is a
hurdler, bicyclist and baseball player of
much promise.
Daly of San Jose played with the Stock
ton Athletic Club team and will try for
end here. His weight is 165 pounds.
Nourse of Santa Ana weighs 145 pounds
and is said to have played an excellent
quarter in his borne team. He will try
for quarter her*.
White, a 150-pound man, will try for
end. His previous experience was with
the Tacoma High School team.
Sollie Wilbur '99, the shot-putter, is a
candidate for center or guard. His weight
is 200 pounds.
The interclass garnet will occur on the
19th, 23d and 28th Insts.
SANTA ROSA SUIT.
A Case recalling th* Murder of Blind
Nancy Merit/ her.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Sept. 10.â A com
plaint was tiled in the Superior Court here
to-day that brings to mind the murder of
blind Nancy Meaner and the prominent
part taKen in the tragedy by the Bryan
family. The plaintiff in the action com
menced to-day is W. J. Bryan, and the de
fendants are . Elizabeth J. Bryan, his
mother. J. L. Winans, Nancy J. Crane and
Sheriff Allen. The property in dispute ad
joins the scene of the celebrated murder
and the plaintiff and his mother were the
defendants in the trial. Plaintiff alleges
that his mother, became greatly indebted
to Winans, who worked upon her fears and
prejudices to cause her to file fraudulent
evidences of indebtedness against the es
tate of his deceased father while acting as
administratrix; that by reason of this al
leged indebtedness theestate of 100 acres
was sold, Winans becoming the purchaser;
that Winans mortgaged the property to
M. D. Goshen and that Goshen was a party
to the fraud, ana that Goshen assigned
the mortgage to Nancy J. Crane, who fore
closed the mortgage.
Plaintiff alleges that the estate was pro
bated in 1883 anrl the power of the admin
istratrix then ceased, but that the sale to
Winans was not effected until 1891. Plain
tiff asks the Court to set aside the decree
of sale and to restrain Nancy J. Crane and
Sheriff Allen from further proceedings in
the line of foreclosure or sale under the
mortgage.
ARDELL'S TRIAL AT VISALIA.
Five Jurors Accepted and Sworn â Genera/
Kittrell Is Confident of Securing
an Acquittal.
VIS ALIA, Cal., Sept 10.â Last evening
the general impression was that Charles
Ardell, charged with train-robbing, would
be allowed to plead guilty to the lesser
charge of "assault with a deadly weapon,"
but on the arrival of General J. R. Kit
trell, Ardell's attorney, any and all bucli
proceedings were knocked out by the old
general declaring that he was here to de
fend his client, not to compromise.
Many stories are afloat in reference to
the confession of Si Lovren. Captain Afer
ritt admits that Lovren made a statement,
but is not willing to divulge its nature,
and is displeased that there was a leak.
Eighty-nine out of 100 talesmen reported
this morning. A great many of the main
witnesses for the defense have not arrived,
and rumor has it that tbey will not, owing
to the arrest of Frank Davenport
The courtroom was not crowded to-day,
as in the Lovren case, and very little
interest was taken. The defendant wears
a confident look and has great faith in E.
O. Miller, who has been added as associate
counsel to his cause.
Five jurors were accepted and sworn in
to-day, viz.: C. M. Coe, farmer, Tulare;
John Ewing, stockraiser, Big Oak Flat; J.
R. Blankenship, stockraiser. Tule River;
J. D. Vannery, farmer, Traver, and F. A.
Doty, owntr of stock corrals, Porterville.

liam J. Kearz was shot and instantly
killed by his father-in-law, Captain J. M.
Morris, at 6:SO o'clock to-night at the
residence of Captain Morris, on Fourth

since Bunday, and had repeatedly threat
ened his wife's and father-in-law's life,
his wife being compelled to flee from home
to her father's house for protection several
times recently.
Last Monday night Kearz followed her
and threatened her life with a carving
knife. Morris attempted to dissuade
Kearz from violence.
Kearz, however, persisted in annoying
his wife and her family, and the affair
culminated to-night in Kearz approaching
the family residence on Fourth street at
the rear door and forcing an entrance.
He was met by Captain Morris, who shot
him twice in the right breast with a
double-barreled shotgun. Kearz dropped
to the floor of the rear porch and expired
after a few gasps.
The remains were conveyed to Guidi
ner's undertaking parlors and the Coroner
is expected on a late electric-car.
Captain MorriÃ, being interviewed by a
Call 'reporter, expressed sorrow at the
step he had been obliged to take, but said
tnat his daughter's life was more precious
to him than anything else.

Front Death.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Sept. 10.â

that ever characterized a Santa Barbara

erecting a handsome residence on Arling
ton Heights, lost control of his horse,
which dashed into the curb on the corner
of Santa Barbara and A/iapamu streets,
breaking a heavy electric- light post in
twain with such force as to shatter the
glass globe in a seventy-foot electric mast
a hundred feet distant, connected with the
post by a staying wire. Hadley was flung
against a square picket fence, shattering
two of the pickets with his head and
missing instant death by precisely one
inch, the next space being occupied by a
fence post. Happily his injuries were not

THE AUDIENCE LAUGHED
He Admits That He Acc.mpa
nied Campbell to the
Cottage.
A VERY QUEEB NARRATIVE.
The Wife and the Son of the Prisoner
Also Take tbe Witness*
Stand.
Oliver W. Winthrop went on the wit
ness-stand in his own defense yasterday,
and the story he told by way of proving
his innocence of the grave charge against
him caused the crowd that filled the
courtroom to repeatedly break into
laughter â so gauzy did it appear. His
wife and his son preceded him, and
the wife, resuming her seat, all the time
her nusoand was testifying sat with a
paper screening her face.
Campbell, the prosecuting witness, sat
for much of tue time back of the Prosecut
ing Attorney, now smiling at the story
and again with eyes closed and looking
weary to a degree.
The prosecution had closed, and it was
expected that the prisoner's counsel,
Frank Bell, would make a statement of
the line oi the defense, but he did not.
H. G. Allen, ticket agent of the Oceanic
Steamship Company, was called as the
first witness lor tne defense. He testified
that James Campbell called on him on
August 3, an<i bought a ticket for Hono
lulu, paying $50; it was a little after noon,
he said.
I. H. Carelo of 1703 Webster street testi
fied that he saw Wintbrop that same night
about 9 o'clock at Steiner and Geary
streets, and had a conversation with him.
Winthrop came from the direction of Geary
street, he said.
James Spanton testified that he met
Winthrop at Turn Verein Hall on Eight
eenth street a few minutes after 9 o'clock
the same night. They were together more
than an hour and rode downtown to
gether. Winthrop, he thought, left the
car at Gough street aboui 10:30 p. M.
Detective Cody went on the stand again
and described the money that he found
in the purse whic:- was" found on Win
throp. Mr. Barnes put twelve $20 pieces,
one $10 piece, two half dollars and other
small pieces in the purse and at his re
quest Cody counted them.
George Jr\ Phelps, who is thought to be
the mysterious"Pete," then took the stand.
He is a machinist, and lives at 2514 Laguna
street. He knows Winthrop, ana met him
on August 3 at California and Drumm
streets. He also saw him on Tuesday
night; they attended a meeting together.
Alter the adjournment, they walked down
to the Examiner office. They separated,
he said, at about 11 o'ciock, the witness
going home. His face was clean shaven,
and Winthrop, he said, remarked as to the
change it made in his appearance, and
Baid that he intended to shave off his own
mustache in a day or so.
Joseph t\ Nounan of 2111 Stockton
itreet was at the meeting in Shiels Hall
an the Tuesday evening that Winthrop
attended. He accompanied Fhelps and
the defendant in their walk after the meet
ing.
John G. Maloney, an ex-police officer,
who occupies the house next to the Dun
ton cottage on California street, remem
bered the night of August 3. He heard no
sounds of pistol shots or any other dis
turbance. His wife testified also that the
only noise she heard was that of chopping
wooa in the cellar.
A number of persons followed one
another testifying that they had seen
Winthrop at one place or another during
tbe 3d, 4th and sth of August.
The afternoon session began with tbe
wife of the defendant, Mrs. Josephine
Winthrop, on tbe stand. She said they
had been married about fifteen years and
that they had resided in this City ten
years.
"What time did your husband leave
home on the morning of August 3?" asked
Air. BelL
"A little before 9."
â¢â¢When did you see him again ?"
"About 6 o'clock."
"What did he do?"
"When he came in he went downstairs a
â while; then he came up and asked il the din
ner was ready. I said, 'Not yei 1 ' and then he
ventouiio gÂ«t some tobacio and fruit. He
â¢waÂ« goue about fifteen minutes, when he came
back and ate b;s supper. After supper be
asked me to get him some rituals irom the
drawer, as he was Â«oing out. Then fee kissed
rue go<.d evening and went. I went out afier
he had gone."
"When d.d you no out?"
"A* out 8."
"And returned?"
â¢â About a qnaner of 10."
'â¢Wnen dia your husband return T"
"About hall-past li. i bad retired when he
can-.e in. 1 read a book for a while, and then
1 thought I'd gel inio 6ed and read It. We
waui d 10 real the book together, and so 1
told him to hurry up and get into bed and I'd
rend it to him. I read till 1 was tireu, and my
husband had none to Sieep. 1 read on till 2
o'clock, when I fell asleep. I woke up at 5
o'ciock ;my husband was still in bed. He got
up about G o'clock, made the fire and woke up
the ch'loren and then came back to bed. I
got u;< shortly after 7 o'clock and my husband
lay in bed till after 9 o'clock.
â¢'He had breskinst with me and left the
houie aL>uut io u'clcck."
â â¢When d.d you next see him?"
"became in about 4 o'clock In the after
noon and read a book to me. I think he re
mained home till supper. We had supper at 6,
and my husband leit the house between 7
and 8."
'Wnen he left the house Tuesday morning
how was iie drrss-d?"
â  He nad tt tiaru, rough suit of clothes and a
blcclc ha ."
"And -vhen he went out after supper how
was lie diessed?"
"He had on dark clothes. I don't know
what kind oi hat he had on."
â¢â¢Wtten did he return ou Tuesday night?"
"Some time after D o'clock."
â¢â¢Ai.d remained in the balance of the even-
Ing?"
'â Yes."
"Wasn't It a little after 9?"
"It may have bÂ«en."
"ma you pass the night together?"
'â¢Ye?. r '
"You never told any one that he had not
patted the ulgh; at h >me?"
".No. If any one says so it's a lie."
The witness .-aid her husband returned
1 orue on Wednesday afternoon at 4 o'clock.
Thy hrst thing ne did was to shave off his
niustache, ari operation in whicli the wit
ness assisted him. Then they went out
toecther.
The little son of Winthrop took the
stand and corroborated bis mother in
several points, but added nothing new.
Then Winthrop himself was called and
the interes. that had been growing for
some time became intense. This is the
Story that he told :
Oil July 31 at 1:30 in the aiternoon he
went to ban Jose on some business, chief
of which W&? to purchase a lot in a ceme
tery ai;d to do some canvassing for a
fiiend who was a candidate for Congress
in the Fifth Congressional District. At
the Vendome Hotel Ue saw James Camp
bell.
Tiie witness missed tne train that after
nnon and wait' d up, taking the train at |
4:30 the next moraine. He came to town j
that day and later met Urquhart at the j
Occidental Hotel. The latter asked nim
to come upstairs and he would introduce
h m to Campbell. They went up together,
Urquhart pointing out Campbell, who was
seated on a sofa near the eievator with his
wife. Winthrop spoke to Campbell and
remained in conversation some time, Ur
mihart having withdrawn. After a while
Campbell asked Winthrop to go down
stair*, saying that he was "ready to go
out there" with him, and that he,*Carr.p
bell, wouid follow him downstairs in ten
minutes.
They went down Montgomery street
toward California, stopped in a saloon
near the corner and took a drink; then
they proceeded to Sacramento street and
took a car to Second avenue. They
walked back to the cottage at 4109 Cali
fornia street. They went up the steps,
Winthrop leading. Campbell immediately
behind. Campbell told him to rintr the
bell and he did so. It was answered by a
lady who wore a hat and a veil, so that he
was unable to get a good look at her. and
he would not now be able to recog
nize her. She invited them in and then
retired, leaving them alone together in the
parlor.
Tnere was a bottle of whisky on a table
and they both drank from it. They con
versed for some time, when Campbell
said: "I am going to stay; come back for
me later."
Wintbrop went out, and by a circuitous
route got back to bis own home at 314
Grove street. He bad dinner, and in >he
evening took a car out to the cottage
again. Arrived there, he found the house
lit up and evident sign* of merry-making
within.
He rang the bell, but received no re
sponse. He rang again and again, but no
answer came. Thinking be was not wanted
he took the car again, and went to a
secret meeting at Seventeenth and Mis
sion streets. He went nome after the
meeting and remained all night.
Next morning he went to town, and
visited a number of places which he men
tioned in detail; bought a coat for $2 50 j
at a fire sale, and took the messenger boy
home with him to pay for it. His wife
was away, hut he found a $5 bill in her '
little treasury, which he took to the corner
grocery and got changed and paid the
boy.
That evening he attended another
lodge meeting in the S'iels building and
went to th-- Examiner office with his two
friends as they described.
At this point in his narrative court ad
journed. The witness will resume his
story in the morning. Frequently, as
stated, the witness' story was interrupted
by the laughter of the audience, and the
bailiff, during the ear.ier part of it, was
more than once called upon to rap for
order. The mystery of why they went to I
the California-street house, whyCampbell
himself should su.-gest going tl ere and
afterward remain alone, bedid not explain.

IN SONOMA.
The Situation as Seen by Ex-Sen
ator Ragrsdale.
Ex-Senator J. W. Ragsdale of Santa
Rosa was in this City yesterday and gave
a flattering report of Republican prospects
there. He said that for every Republican
in Sonoma County who bolted the party
t here were two or three Democrats to take
his place. He told of a straw vote token
by a thrashing crew oi eighteen men.
They were all McKmley men.
The ranks of the Republican party have
been strengthened by a large nnmberof
ex-Republicans who had gone over to the
Populists and who have returned to their
first love. They objected to being bound
band and foot and sold body and soul by
Cator and Wardall to the Democracy,
which has no use for Populists except for
tneir votes.
The people of Sonoma County have
never before shown so much interest in
politics as they are doing now, especially
in the issues of protection and the cur- j
rency.
Many who were at first inclined to get j
wild on the question of free coinage have,
aficr studying the subject, been convinced
that protection of home products is of I
more importance for the people of this
coast than any other issue.
The Republican meetings in Sonoma
County have been well attended and have
been marked by more than ordinary en- '
thusiasm.
Mr. Kapsdale predicted that Sonoma
County would roll up a nandsome major
ity for protection and home rule.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1896.
POISON WHS IN
ALL THE CANDIES
Mary McDowell Was a
Very Determined
Suicide.
TWO PATHS TO DEATH.
Failing to Be Drowned She
Then Used a Deadly
Drug.
RESULT OF AN ANALYSIS.
Failure of the Victim to Conceal Her
Identity by Taking a
False Name.
The mystery concerning the death of
the young woman who jumped into the
bay Wednesday and who said that she
was Harmona Wells seems to be in a fair
way to be cleared up. Being rescued from
tne water by two boatmen, she was taken
to the Receiving Hospital. On the way
she ate chocolate creams from a bag. Sue
died at the Receiving Hospital a few hours
later. There were some chocolate creams
in the bag remaining;, and these were
handed to Dr. diaries G. Morgan, physi
cian and chemist, whose office is at the cor
ner of Sixth and Harrison streets, to ana
lyze. He has reported to the Coroner that
the chocolate creams were poisoned. In
the ha* with the candy was a white pow
der which is proved to be arsenic. The
woman evidently intended first to commit
suicide by drowning, but probably bad
previously eaten some of the chocolate
creams. She leaped overboard in what
seemed to be deep water near Meiggs
wharf, but the tide was very low and sue
was pulled oat by the two boatmen, Nes
bit and Hennessey.
The story which Joseph Nesbit, the
boatman, told to the Coroner yesterday
throws some light on the affair. He heard
the woman scream for help after she
jumped into the bay. He noticed after
he had rescued her with the assist
ance of Hennes>>y that the bag with
chocolate creams in it was open
on the wharf. The woman said nothing
excepting that she could not Bee. At tne
Receiving Hospital she said that she had
no cause to wish ;â¢ live.
Yesterday Mr. and Mrs. John Luttell of
Linden street, Oakland, positively iden
tified tne body. The woman was Miss j
Mary McDowell. She came from the East i
and has been living in Pitiville, this State, {
with her aunt, Mrs. James Sncli. Mr. and
Mrs. Lutteli met Mary McDowell on the
cars on the way to this City, September 1,
and lett her at bixieenih street, Oakland. I
She came at once to this City and went to
tiie New Western Hoiel, where she regis- 1
tered, giving her address as Dcs Moines,
lowa. She remained at the New Western
Hotel until about 4:30 Tuesday afternoon.
Where she went Tuesday night is a
question. There is also a question con
cerning the disappearance of certain ar
ticles which she is supposed to have car
ried with her when she left the New
Western Hotel. The missing articles are
a lady's gold watch upon which her
monogram was engraved, a diary in
whir h she had entered an account of her
movements in this City, and a brown
leather satchel. James Mayles, a bell
boy at the New Western Hotel, called at
the Morgus yesterday and added bis
identification o. the body to that pre
viously made by Mr. and Mrs. LuttelL
Mrs. H. Hall, who is employed in the
New Western Hotel, fnrnishes some in
teresting fact-. She says that when Miss
McDowell came to the hotel sue gave
sigui of being careless about her valuables
the first day that she was there.
Sue went out, leaving the key in her
door, ana was gone some time. Her
watch and a purse containing what
seemed to be a considerable sum of money
were found by Mrs. Hall in Miss McDow
ell's room on a table on that occasion. At
another time Mrs. Hali noticed a diary
lying open in the room in which Miss Mc-
Dowell lodged, and in this book Miss Mc-
Dowell had made memoranda concerning
her movements in this City. She wrote
ol visiting North Beach and "South
Beach," the latter nieruorandutu giving
evidence that she was a stranger here.
She also wrote about visiting the Chfi,
and a brief memorandum also furnished
the knowledge that she "eot back from
the Cliff in time to dine at the Palace Ho
tel." She also visited the Grand Hotel
according to another memo.andnm. Mrs!
Hall noticed Miss McDowell's watch and
observed the monogram, "M. McD.," on
the case.
During her stay at the New Western
Hotel Miss McDowell talked with Mrs.
Hall and said that she expected to go
away last Monday, but that she had pack
ages to send away, and that, as she found
the express office closed, she had to re
main over until Tuesday. She had four
small packages to send by express, each
of the size of a small candy-box, and also
had four letters to mail. OnÂ« of these
was directed to Dcs Moines ana one to
"George." This is ail that Mrs. Hall re
ca.ls concerning these letters. Mrs. Hall
is positive that one was addressed to
George, the other name not being noticed.
Her attention was attracted by the fact
tl. at i.er own husband (Mrs. Hall's) was
named George, and the Gate when she paw
the letters was the anniversary of her hus
band's death.
While M;ss McDowell was at the New
Western Hotel she had little company.
She saiii to ihe guests, to Mrs. G. W. Har
rison, an Eastern la.iy, among others,
hat she was â¢'lonesome." Other guests'
noticed that she was despondent, observ
ing her to sit with ncr head on her hand
at times and failing to read the open book
on her knees, while she oeemea to be lost
in thought. The clerk of the hotel, seeing
that she nad registered from Dcs Moines,
asked her abou: her Knowledge of persons
in lowa, but she seemed inclined to avoid
the subject. She tried to hide her identity
also at the Receiving Hospital, giving a
false name.
The name of "George" may lead to
clearing up why Miss McDowell came to
this C.tv. .To Mrs. Lutteil she said that
she came here for a good time, and that
she was soon going to make a trip to
Shasta. Yesterday a letter addressed to
Miss McDowell waÂ« received by the Coro
ner from the New Western Hotel. When
this was opened it was found to be signed
'â¢George." This letter was written on a
sheet of paper which was headed with the
business address of Georpe W. Levens,
proprietor of the Sissons and Fall River
stage line. This letter woe dated Septem
ber 5. There were several more or less
seemingly significant sentences in the
communication. "George" wrote that he
supposed that she would start East soon;
that he did "not want you to believe for a
moment that I thoueht there was
anything in that report," and expressed
beiief that he wouid never see her again.
The letter concluded as foilows:
"Jim Scott came down and took dinner
with me Sunday. He said that Leon a
had received a letter from you, but he did
not know what was in it. Don't you think
you had better com* back to fall River,
where you have bo many friends? How
long do you expect to stay in the City? Be
careful you do not get discouraged and go
to â that place you spoke of, for if you do
we will be sure to meet again, but I would
prefer to meet you under different circum
stances. Well, Ido not Â£now of anything
more of interest."
While Miss McDowell was at the New
Western Hotel she impressed every one
with her ladylike deportment. She had
only one caller, so far as the people in the
hotel can recollect. He was a middle-aged
man. She said that he was her uncle. He
called two days, and she Baid that he was
"showinn her around the town." No one
can describe this man. Apart from the
disappearance of the watch tbere is no
reason to think that she met with bad
treatment in this City, and when it is dis
covered where she lodged Tuesday night
tnis may be found. The name of the man
who called for Miss McDowell and who
went out with her from the New Western
Hotel sounded like Lemo.re, but there is
no other present clew to his identity.
An examination of the dead woman's
stomach will be made. Tbere is nodoubt,
in view of the fact that she was seen to eat
candies poisoned with arsenic, that ar
senic will be discovered.
Mr. and Mrs. John Littrell of Fall
RivtT Mills, Siiasta County, are the guests
of Mr. and Mrs. Isaac L'.ttrell of 1723 Lin
den street, Oakland. On seeing the pub
lished accounts of a girl's mysterious
death they were impressed with the idea
that it was an acquaintance of theirs.
Tnis morning on seeing the pictures of
the giri this idea was so strengthened that
it was decided to go to the San Francisco
Morgue and view the remains.
On arriving there they found it to be
Miss Mary McDowell of Pittsville,
Shasta County, and a traveiine companion
on tin. train here ten days ago. Mrs. Litt
reil, in telline the facts to a Call repre
sentative, said : 'Miss McDowell was one of
the nicest girls of that part uf the coun
try, and moved in the very best society.
She was only about 20 years of age, and
was not keeping company with any young
man. She resided with an uncle, James
Snell, and has another at Redding, James
Eastep.
"We took the train at Anderson Septem-
Der 1 and she was in the car. En route
she bougtit fruit and papers, seemingly
having money, all her little belongings
being kept in a hand satchel, whicu she
carried in her lap. She was not much of
a talker and did not tell us her object in
coming to the bay. \Ve alighted at Six
teenth-street station and came here, while
she went to San Francisco and to the New
Western Hotel.
"At tbe Morgue to-day they told me
thai nothing had been seen of the hand
satchel nor of a beautiful diamond ring
which she wore when on tbe train. The^e
are missing, as is also her purse and any
money that she may have had with her.
After leaving tbe Morgue we went to the

while here took her driving one evening.
It cannot be learned whether she corre

PHOENIX REPUBLICAN CLUB
State Board of Equalization Cen
suredâCampaign Oratory and
Enthusiasm at Scottish Hall.
The Phoenix Republican Club, an or
ganization with 800 enrolled voters, held
another of its famous campaign meetings
at Scottish Hall, on Larkin street, last
evening. In the system of its work, in
nctivity and patriotic enthusiasm, tnis
Republican club is unexcelled. It is now
organizing a large drill corps, which will
engage the attention and support of many
able young men.
The meetine last night was called to
order by the popular president of the club.
Colonel T. V. Eddy. Under the head of
new business, tbe secretary. Andrew
Branch, read the following resolutions,
which were briefly discussed and unani
mously adopted :
Whereas, The State Board of Equalization
has seen tit to raise the assessment ot the City
and County of San Francisco 20 per cent over
and above the assessment returned by the As
sessor; and whereas, the Assessor after a care
ful review of the assessable property of the
City and County ha 1 raised the same some
$30,000,000 over the assessment of 1895,
there was no justification for the arbitrary,
and we believe nnjust action of the State
Board of Equalization in rnatinnr such rais.
Retolvtd, That we condemn the action of the
members of the S.a'e Board of Equalization
who voted for this most unjust and arbitrnry
raise in adding this 20 percent to the burdens
of the citizens of tbe City and County of San
Francisco. Be It fnriber
Reaolvtd, That wa have the utmost confidence
in tbe Assessor of the City and County of San
Francisco, and believe that he has done all lv
his power to faithfully and intelligently exe
cute the laws in bis assessments of tbe prop
erty of the City and County be represents.
Oorge W. Robe of tue Thirty-eiphth
Assembly District, a promising young
camoaign orator, was the first speaker in
troduced. He contended that the pros
perity of a nation depended upon the em
ployment of its people, and reasoned that
the Republican National Convention un
derstood this when the delegates declared
for protection to American industries.
The speaker referred to the brilliant rec
ord of William McKinley asja loyal soldier
in battle and aeifted statesman in peace.
His remarks evoked much enthusiasm.
Judge Gro zincer also made a brief and
able speech, in whicn he touched on the
silver question. He said the Democratic
party, in its extremity, had attempted to
dodge the real issue of protection by rais
ing a false issue to deceive vo.ers.
A rousing speech, which enlivened the
audience to cheers, was delivered by the
president of the club, Colonel T. V*. Eddy.
He spoke of his campaign tour in South
ern California, and the enthusiasm which
wa < a feature of all the meetings.
To-morrow this gifted orator leaves for
Northern California. He is regarded by
the State Central Committee as one of the
most effective speakers of the campaign.
The programme of the evening was
diversified. Misn Sadie Levy sang "Ben
Bolt" Charles Mendell and George Reed
also sang. A recitation by Mrs. Bertha
Levy was a feature of the meeting. Cam
paign songs were sung by W. S. Kellett.
An invitation was received from the
West End Republican Club of the Thirty
seventh district, to attend a meeting at
tbe Chutes on the evening of September
17. It was announced in the invitation
that H. M. Shortridge, Eugene F. L u-1,
George C. Porkins and George A. Knight
wonld address the multitude.
The Piioeaix Club voted to accept the
invitation, as the Phoenix rises to every
occasion in this campaign.

wilh patriotic Republican* of the Twenty
first Senatorial District. George A. Went
worth presided.
He, wth Eugene F. Loud, the Republi
can no*ninee for Congress, and John F.
Sheehan.addressed the gathering upon the
pertinent political issues of the day.
James A. Stevens also spoke and sones
were contributed by Mr. Nelson and the
Knickerbocker quartet.
The speakers emphasized the prosperity
which would follow a protective policy
and met with loud applause.

The Latest Lie Concocted
to Mislead the Un

ABOUT M'KINLEY BADGES
Made Exclusively by the Highest-
Paid White Labor in
the City.
THE GIRLS GIVE TESTIMONY.
Statement of Charles A Caihoun,
Manager of the Peerless Mann*
factoring Company.
A sensational story was given publicity
yesterday to the effect that the Republican
badges issued by tbe State Central Com
mittee had been manufactured by Cuinese.
The manufacturing firm vras Hue Kai &
Co., or the Peerless Manufacturing Com
pany, which employs nothing but white
labor. Superintendent Calhoun said in re
gard to the badges:
"There was not the fineer of a Chinese
pl?ccd on one of them. They were made
entirely by white labor. From the time
the silk came into my hands right up to
The Badge Made by White Girls.
the delivery of the packages to the dray- j
man not a Chinese touched the eoods.
White labor earned its wages and we made |
a small profit."
The Peerless Manufacturing Company
(Hue Kai & Co. ), is the best appointed eg- i
taoiisnment in ban Francisco. Theventi- I
lation is perfect and themachinery of the '
latest kind. The girls employed are all j
experts and wonld not leave tbe factory J
for a considerable advance.
"I never was better treated in my life," ;
said one of them yesterday. "Talk ab ut '
your free silver and protection, why there !
never was greater protection *nd freer sil- !
ver than right here in this store. Every j
Saturday night the silver ia right there, I
and as for protection, why we are ricLt in
tt. We are working for Chinese, but we i
are not in competition with Chinese cheap \
labor, and we girls make more w*ges u-ali ]
ciris similarly situated in any other fac
tory in town.
Tbe members of the Young Men's Re
publican Club of tbe Forty-first Assembly '
District at their meeting in Tilden Hall !
on Union street last eveuing were highly '
indignant.
Joseph W. Wood and J. B. Sheridan,
who acted as secretary, stated to a Call
reporter that the Young Men's Republi
can Club of the Forty-first District had
given an order to William H. Donohue
and Tony Kerdell, the jewelers, at 134
Sutter street, for 125 coid badges and that
they expected the goods to be delivered
either to-day or to-morrow.
"But," as Chairman Clarksaid, "fearing
that some member of the club had ob
tained badges elsewhere the club to-night
appointed a committee consisting of
Charles Burdett, William Nixon and Da
vid Jacquard, with instructions to make
strict inquiries and a thorough investiga
tion of the whole matter and ascertain
if possible where the calumny originated.
"Bui you can rest assured that this club
has orlered no badges from Hue Kai &
Co. or any other Mongolian.
"Again, we do not need Chines') votes
to elect McKinley. -We will elect him by
American votes, and I might add that I
know of no more fittine place for Chinese
votes than with the transmogrified De
mocracy, Populist, socialist and anarchist
party, to which Mr. Bryan has become
affiliated."
FOR THE PRIMARIES.
Important Meeting of the Republi-
can County Commit
tee.
The Republican County Committee held
a regular meeting last night in Shiels'
Hall for the purpose of preparing for the
primary election. Chairman . Manwaring
presided.
A communication was received from P.
A. Inquist, publisher of the California
Journal, a Swedish weekly newspaper
moving in the orbit of Los Angeles
County, setting forth that Mr. Inquist de
sired to remove the Journal to San Fran
cisco and that financial aid from the com
mittee was necessary to enable him to do
so. Mr. Inquist set forth that there were
5000 Swedish voters in California and that
his journal would exert great influence in
securing their votes for McKinley and
protection.
Tbe writer added that the majority of
the Swedish population were Republicans
and that the only political (Swedish club
extant was an independent one the mem
bers wbereoi had not made up their minds
how to vote, bm were waiting.
Mr. Inquist did not say what they were
waiting for, but from the br<-ad smile
which pervaded the commit â¢ was ap
parent that they were waiting for tiie
influence of the California Journal to
thine upon them, properly stimulated, of
cou.se.
Amid more smiles the matter was re
ferred to the finance committee, who will,
no doubt, hold the prop-r Inquiat on it.
The call for the primary election was
read by the secretary, Grove P. Avers,
and unanimously adopted.
On motion of John M. Chretien the
members of the County Committee were
requested to hand in to the executive
committee by next Saturday the lists of
poliine-places and election officers for
their districts.
Chairman Manwaring took the floor
and called attention to the recent action of
the State Board of Equalization raising
the assessment roll of San Francisco by 30
per cent. He denounced the action of the
board as an infamous outrage on this com
munity. He therefore moved the appoint
ment of a committee of three to draft reso
lutions expressive of the indignation of
the community at the action of the State
Equalizers. Alva Watt, in the chair, ap
pointed Chairman Manwaring, John M.
Chretien and E. J. Casey a* such com
mittee.
The call for the primarieÂ« provides that
the Republican primary eiection shall be
held on Saiurday, September 19, in the
various Assembly districts. There shall
be at least one and not more than two
polling places in each district, as may be
determined by the executive committee.
The polls shall b- open from 12 o'ciock
noon until 7 in the evening.
All polling places must be on the ground
floor and the ballot-box so place J as to be
seen from the sidewalk. The top of the

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
EJECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
The strength of Hobart's letter shows
that it came from a strong man.
What California workingman found any
profit in the Cleveland administration?
Bryan may well be silent on his free
trade record, for the record itseli speaks
loud enough.
We have tried one step in the direction
of free trade, and no intelligent man
wishes to take another.
Let the wage-earner ask himself, "What
is there in all i3ryan's promises that prom
ises anything for my welfare?
There is no defender for the Gorman
Â»nd Wilson tariff. Even Gorman and
Wilson themselves are silent.
We have celebrated the greatness of
California, and* now let us resolve to ad
vance her welfare by protecting her in
dustries.
The deficit in the National revenue for
the month of August was about $10,000,
-000, and still Mr. Bryan jauntily declares
there is no issue in that.
Democratic leaders seem to have aban
doned Bryan's fight and are now trying to
â¢ecure their own election to Congress with
out regard to the boy orator.
Bryan so completely exhausted himself
In his speech at Madison-square Garden
that his letter of acceptance was about as
limp ana loose as a wet dishrag.
It is not clear what kind of wine Hill
furnished to Bryan at that famous dinner,
but it seems certain that he took Muinm
himself ana is still sticking to it.
San Francisco crospered under protec
tion and has been injured by the Wilson
tariff. Let us vote for McKiuley and pro
tection and advance San Francisco.
"How can I best help my trade, my
State and the Nation by my vote?" is the
question every patriot is asking himself,
ana the only answer is, "by voting for
McKinley."
If Cleveland tad any vim and vigor in
him he would take some action in the
Cuban question just to let the country
know he has some ideas above those of a
lone fisherman.
The importance of the tariff issue to all
the industries of California will not be
overlooked by the people notwithstanding
the efforts of the DemocratÃ to get them to
look the other way.
From the letter of acceptance of Garret
A. Hobart it is clear he is a good running
mate for McKinley, and the people can
see that his nomination fox Vice-Prebi
dent was no accident.
The letters of acceptance of Bryan and of
Hobart appeared on the same day and were
published yesterday side by side to the great
injury of the boy orator, whose effusion
teemed stale and flat by the contrast.
In his letter of acceptance Bryan said :
"It is not necessary to discuss the tariff
question at this time"; and he was quite
right in saying it, for the experience of the
last three years Las taught the people all
they wish to know about that subject
from the free-trader's point of view.
Li Hung Chang has everywhere shown
a great interest in railways, but as he has
not asked to be shown through a bicycle
factory it is clear that the Chinese intel
lect hasn't yet reached the full develop
ment of the enlightened man of this cen
tury.
The curious thing about this campaign
is that no one of any note is going to help
Bryan. He has to do all the traveling, all
the talking, all the dodging, and there is
an increasing probability that before he
pets through he will have to pay his own
expenses.
Study the effect of the Gorman tariff on
your own home and your own trade and
you will see pretty clearly what hss been
its effect on the people generally ; and you
will also see why you should vote for the
party which is pledged to re peal that tariff
and restore the protective system under
wnich we enjoyed the greatest prosperity
as a Nation known to history.
Toe Republican platform on which Lin
coln was elected declaredin fftvor of "that
policy o! National exchanges which se
cures to the workingruan living wages, to
agriculture remunerative prices, to me
chanics and manufacturers an edequate
reward for their skill, labor and enterprise,
and to the Nation commercial prosperity
and independence." On the same plat
form McKinley stands to-day, and rightly
asks the support of all who, like Lincoln,
believe in promoting American industry
against the competition of the world.
WORKINGMEN OF CALIFORNIA.
The time has come when the working
men of California should give a most care
ful and serious study to the issues before
them in tbis campaign. It is folly for any
wajre-earner to believe that his own per
sonal welfare is not concerned in the
result. All the issues of the day are
economic. All of them deal directly with
:he industries of the country and every
industry that pays wages will be affected
by the measures to be carried out by the
next administration. There is no evaaing
the force of on economic law. No man or
nation can violate such a law and prosper.
Ti.e Republican and the Democratic par
ties propose economic measures of directly
opposite tendencies. The Republican meas
ures justly Dear the titlÂ«* of protection.
They are intended to protect American
industry from the competition of other
countries, ana Ihe value of the American
dollar from a disastrous depreciation.
Democracy proposes to throw down the
barriers of protection, to expose the
American worker to the competition of
Europe and the Orient, and the American
dollar to ( whatever fluctuations may come
from the free coinage of silver without
any governmental safeguards whatever.
These directly opposed measures cannot
be equally good. If one tends to the wel
fare of the countiy the other must tend to
its injury. If one guards the interests of
workingmen the other must be to those
interests adverse, hostile, dangerous and
destructive.
The American workingman has not to
jr.dgc these measures by theory only. He
has had within tne last four years ample
experience in the practical operation of a
free-trade tariff in sharp contrast with
the operation of protection. We had
during the war an experience with fluc
tuating money as compared with the
steadfast money of to-day. We know how
eager all men were after the war to return
to specie payment. We know how eager
all American producers and employers
are nojr to return to a protective system.
From these things every intelligent work
ingman may learn how to vote. Expe
rience is the teacher of the wise.
For a proper understanding of the oper
ation of the economic law of free trade or
protection the workingman need not
study the conditions of the whole world,
nor even those of all the Union. He can
find facts enough to justify a conclusion
within the limits of his own horizon. He
need not look beyond his own city, tie need
hardly look beyond his own trade. The
chances are he will rind enough in His
own home. Notding is required of him
but to profit by the lessons of bis indi
vidual experience. ,
We have published in The Call inter
views with many workingmen of different
trades in San Francisco and all have told
the same tale of prosperity under protec
tion ana disaster under free trade. All
recognize that the free coinage of silver
without the co-operation of other nations
would lower the purchasing power of
wages without giving any compensating
advantages to the wage-earner. These
men have many of them affiliated in
former campaigns with the Democratic
party, but they have learned the lesson of
experience and will vote hereafter for pro
tection to industry.
In the nature of things we cannot
publish interviews with all the working
men of the City. They, however, can
interview one another. They can talk
over together their exp riences of the
last four years. They can learn from
one another how the economic force
of free trade has worked on the industry
of San Francisco and tbe wage-earning
power of its men and . women. They can
see what effect has been wrought in the
shop and in the home, and as the past is
always the best lamp to light the future
they can see by what has been what will
be in San Francisco when it lias been ae
cided whether for the next four years we
shall continue present conditions or return
to protection and prosperity.
It is a known fact that more than 80 per
cent of the commerce of the world is settled in
gold or on a gold basis. Such free-coi nag r.
legislation, if ever consummated, would dis
criminate against every producer of wheat,
cotton, corn or rye â who should, in justice, be
equally entitled with the silver-owner to sell
his products to the United States treasury at a
profit fixed by the Government â and against
all producers of iron, steel, zinc or copper,
who might properly claim to have their metals
made into current coin. It would as well be
a fraud upon all persons forced to accatt a
currency that stimulated and at the same
time degraded. â Garret A. Hobart.
A RINGING LETTER.
In his letter accepting the nomination
of the Republican party for Vice- President
Garret A. Hobart says: "For the first two
fiscal years of the so-called McKinley tar
iff the receipts from customs were $380,
-807,980. At this writing the Wilson tariff
act has been in force for nearly two full
fiscal years, but the total receipts, actual
and estimated, cannot exceed $312,441,947.
A steady deficit, constantly depleting the
resources of the Government, and trench
inc even upon its gold reserve, has brought
about public distrust and business disaster.
It has, too, necessitated the sale of $262,
-000,000 of bonds, thereby increasing to that
extent the National debt."
A good deal has been written and spoken
to prove the destructive effect of the Wil
son-Gorman tariff act upon the income
and disbursement accounts of the Govern
ment, but Mr. Hobart puts the whole mat
ter in a nutshell when >he shows how there
has Deen, tnere is still and there will con
tinue to be deficits under the operation of
that law. The Democratic party's tariff
failed to receive from revenue sources in
the iirst two years of its operation as much
as was received in the first two years of
the McKinley tariff by nearly $70,000,000,
and, moreover, in the same two years
President Cleveland increased the bond
debt oi the Nation by $262,000,000, which,
when added to the interest that will ac
crue during the life of the bonds, makes
the total of the Government's bond obli
gations over $500,000,000 more than they
were when Cleveland waa inaugurated. By
the time the Republican party can get the
macninery of the Government to running
as it should run the deficit in revenues
will be fully $150,000,000, and it would not
be surprising if Cleveland would not have
to sell more bonds to keep the goldreserve

down and out.
Just how long the people will be williug
to let that kind of financiering go on they
themselves will have to say, but if they
are not already very tired of it they should
read Mr. Hobarfs analysis of the opera
tion of the Wilson-Gorman act. But the
failure of the act to provide expense
money for the Government and the issue
of $262,000,000 of bonds are very small
matters as compared to the losses which
trade, commerce, agriculture and industry
nave sustained in the last two and a half
years. There are official figures which
give the nnmber of commercial failures
and the losses to business enterprises by
reason of Democratic tariff tinkering, but
there are no records of the misery which
it inflicted upon tne industrial millions.
.Nevertheless, Mr. Bryan cays. "ft is not

necessary to discuss" at this time the
cause of all this misery. He does not ap
pear to regard the deplorable condition of
our wage class and industries as of much
consequence.
But vastly more than a mere assertion of a
purpose to reconstruct the National currency
ii suggested by the Chicago platform. It as
sumes, in fact, the form of a revolutionary
propaganda. It embodies a menace of Na
tional disintegration and destruction. This
spirit manifested itself in a deliberate propo
sition to repudiate the plighted public faith,
to impair the sanctity of the obligation of
private contract, to cripple the credit of the
Nation by stripping the Government of the
power to borrow money as the urgent exigen
cies of the treasury may require, and, in a
word, to overthrow alt the foundations of
financial and industrial stability. â Garret A.
Hobart.
HILL'S INDEPENDENCE.
Mr. Bryan lunched with Senator Hill a
week or so ago, and ever since there has
been a suspicion that the worthies had
some kind of a private understanding
which would be of advantage to the Presi
dential candidate. Ye3terday, however,
Hill positively refused to go to the State
Convention as a delegate pledged to sup
port the Chicago platform. This would
seem to indicate that Hill will support
Palmer and Buckner, but all the same
Hill so worded his communication that it
can be twisted to mean anything. He
simply refuses to be a pledged delegate.
He does not say that he is for Bryan, nor
does he say he ia against him. Senator
Hill is a New York Tammany politician
who is very anxious to serve another term
in the United States Senate.
It may be accepted as a fact, though,
that Hill is arranging for some deals, else
be would have accepted the position of
delegate under the conditions imposed, for
that would have been Democratic. Tam
many cares nothing for National politics,
but it does care to control the elective and
the appointive offices in New York City ,
and its fondness for H.ll would make it do
pretty much as he a&ked it to do for his
own political interests. It is very clear,
therefore, that Hill knew he would not
offend Tammany by retuÂ»int< to be com
mitted to indorse the Chicago platform,
although Tammany is supposed to be
working very faithfully for Bryan. In
view of the peculiar methoas*of Tam
many, Hill's action with reference to the
Buffalo convention may be accepted as'
meaning that Bryan is to be traded for
anybody or anything that will strengthen
the local Democracy.
The Republican party has always stood for
the protection of the American home. It has
aimed to secure it in the enjoyment of all the
blessings of remunerated industry, of moral
culture and of favorable physical environ
ment. It was the party which instituted the
policy of free homesteads, and which holds
now that this policy should be re-established,
and that the public lands now vacant and sub
ject to entry in any part of the National ter
ritory should be preserved against corporate
aggression as homes for the people. â Garret
A. Hobart.
A CONSPIRACY BREWING.
The air all over the country is lull of
rumors to the effect that there is a move
ment on foot in Democratic and Populist
circles to make the election of Congress
men and State legislators the ultimate of
their effort. It appears that the leaders
are discouraged over the outlook for
Bryan's election, and they believe it would
be the safer plan to put in their best work
and best mone3 T , too, to secure a few cer
tainties, such as Congressmen and Sena
tors. How many Democrats are in this
conspiracy would be hard to tell, but there
is no doubt at all that Populists every
where are ready to trade off Bryan for
support for local and Congressional candi
dates.
The plan of the combine appears to be
to shape matters now so that they will be
in position in the off year and in 1900 to
make themselves felt in a way that would
be worth somethine. Bryan has become
so much of an extremist since he took to
the hustings that his managers are getting
alarmed. -They know that public senti
ment is conservative and that while great
crowds may greet Bryan everywhere there
is a vast difference between being moved
by curiosity and by honesi convictions ; be
sides, the more the people turn out to see
Bryan the more he thinks he is bigger
than his party, and in tue same propor
tion is the advice of his managers dis
regarded.
But, anyway, the feeling is growing in
Popocratic circles that a bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush, and hence the
scheme to make the election of Congress
men and State legislators the center of
effort; and there is good political sense
in the game the conspirators are looking
to two and four years hence for full re
ward. But it is a shabby way to treat the
young man from Nebraska. No doubt
Sewall's candidacy is naving a eood deal
to do with the combine. He is a national
banker, a very wealthy man, an enemy of
labor organizations and is decidedly in
favor of the Government subsidizing lii 3
merchant ships. So, altogether, there is
some basis for the rumor that more Con
gressmen and Senators and less of Bryan
ia wanted.
The Democracy of Bath never dared to run
Sewa'd as a candidate for any important
office for fear of ruining their party. Once
or twice he had been elected an Alderman by
thÂ« Republicans. Every time he had since
been a nominee he had been snowed under by
Democratic votes. How could men of any
principle vote for such a mant The Democ
racy believed in free trade. Sewall wax a
rampant high protectionist. The Democrats
had made asses of themselves in nominating
him; now they expect the Populists to follow
suit. â L. C. Batcman, Populist candidate for
Governor in Maine.
CAPITAL AND WEALTH.
"Labor creates capital," say a Mr. Bryan
in his letter of acceptance, but he is very
much mistaken. Labor is itself capital
and it creates wealth. Capital is a pro
ducing agency, while wealth means leis
ure. The fkill of the mechanic and the
muscle of the laborer are capital, exactly
as are the dollars of the one who employs
them. There ia wealth accumulation
when expenditure isless than the income,
as there is debt accumulation when expen
diture is greater than the income, but
capital enters into the transaction only to
the extent of producing the income. It is
true, however, that the producing power
of either form of capital, labor or dollars,
may bo impaired; and it is equally true
that neither one could be crippled without
the other sustaining injury. They are
interdependent and their natural relation,
the one to the other, is one of harmonious
co-operation, and in ratio to the mainte
nance of this relation, which is a purely
reciprocal one, is their productive power
maintained and sustained.
The relation between these two forms of
capital, labor and dollars, in the Usited
States is by reason of natural causes
more intimate than in any other country.
The United States has the raw material,
the mechanical skill, the machinery, the
labor and the dollars to supply nearly
every known commercial commodity
which gives capital, labor and dollars an
extraordinary opportunity to accumulate
wealth. It so happens, too, that our con
sumptive demand is equal to fully 96 per
cent of our production. That is to say,
after supplying our wants we have a sur
plus equal to about 4 per cent of our total
production which we put upon the world's
markets for sale.
The philosophy of the situation is, then,
Shall our owu capital, labor and dollars,
resume work and manufacture and other
wise prepare for our food and our other con
sumptive requirements from material that
we have at hand, or shall we rely for the
moit part upon other countries and let
our capital lie idle? But if we conclude
to look to our own resources we shall find
ourselves confronted by markets full of
articles of consumption from countries
where the standard of living and the
degree of individual liberty is very much
lower than we wish to maintain, and
which enables those other countries to
supply us with goods and wares cheaper
than we can supply them from our own
raw material. Theoretically, it would seem
that we should get our supplies where
they could be had for the least money,
but the practical operation of such a policy
would be to keep our capital, labor and
dollars, in enforced idleness, which would
not only reauce the earning power, but
deprive it of all opportunity to maintain a
margin of difference between expenditure
and income and thus prevent it from
accumulating wealth. Under such a con
dition of operation whatever profits our
labor and dollars might earn would be
quickly absorbed by those of other coun
tries who supply our markets with com
modities â commodities we could produce
even better than those who supply us.
American labor being American capital
and American dollars being American
capital, it would seem to be only fair and
right that these capital factors should be
protected against hurtful invasion when
they try to increase the general and
individual wealth of the country by sup
plying our markets with all articles of
consumption that can be produced from
our own material. The Kepubiican party
believes that American labor being Ameri
can capital should not be deprived of con
ditions which would enable it to get
enough from its employment to insure
the widest possible margin between what
it earns and what it consumes, so that
there may be a satisfying and encouraging
increase of wealth. The whole demand of
American labor is, and it has a natural
right to demand as much, that it shall
have continuous opportunity to employ
itself at wages wnich shall enable it to
live from day to day as it becomes a citizen
of the greatest nation in the world to live,
and not exhaust its entire income.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
The familiar figure of genial Paul Neumann
was observable at the Palace and Grand ho
tels for a time yesterday, and General Neu
mann was soon surrounded by a coierie of old

The ex-Attorney-General of Hawaii recounted
many reminiscences of his experiences, both
as the chief factotum of the erstwhile Queen
Lil and as a member of the bar of San Fran
cisco. As usual his stories were pleasantly re
ceived.
Mr. Neumann is not looking so rotund and
hale as on some of his former trips from the
islands. He lays it to his long stay among the
palms.
"I usually get up here about once a year,"

"About the sugar crop down there in Ha

probably a fourth larger* as a crop than last
year.
"The crop and the price suit ns first rate.

THE NEW SMALL SLEEVES.
Two of the most graceful of the new sleeves
are snovrn here. In one the fitted sleeve is cov
ered with sleeve goods which is gathered into
the seams. This is particularly pretty for silk
and chiffon, in fact, any material not too
beavy. The lighter-weight silks are made up
after the model with very good results, and
some satin so treated is exceedingly pretty.
The new canvas cloths.which are thin enough
to allow a bright silk lining to show through.
are exceedingly picturesque in this wrinkled
or gathered sleeve.
The fitted sleeve is suitable for all fabrics. A
combination of materials may be employed in
making it. One was of Dresden silk, with the
puff of dark thin canvas cloth oi which the
waist was made, having a bolero front with a
blouse vest of the silk. The back of the waist
was smooth over a fitted lining with a coat
basque laid in pleats aud reaching only to the
under-arm seams.
A green mohair gown had tlve puffs of mo
hair, the lawn sleeves and a round yoke on
the waist being of embroidered batiste over a
violet silk lining.

A recent bulletin of the Weather Bureau
gives the following directions for governing
one's actions in a cyclone:
"Go to the cellar on the first intimation of
the approaching storm. Don't move east,
northeast or southeast. On reaching the cel
lar, place yourself against the west wall, or If
that cannot be done, get as near the southwest
corner as possible, face to the wall. Then, in
case the building is carried away, it will be
carried over and above you, and there will be
less danger from the debris, which is moved
eastward. Under no circumstances seek an
east or northeast wtill or corner.
"If pressed by the advancing cloud, throw
yourscli on tue ground, head oast and hands
over it to protect. If a slump or other firm
body likely to endure the storm is in the vicin
ity take a position on the east side of it, lying
prone on the ground witb the head towerJ it.
Never take refuge ia a forest grove or orchard,
or ia a. building or behind a fence. Do not re
main in the house if you can get out; if obliged
to remain in avoid contiguity to doors, win
dows, stoves or heavy pieces of furniture."

ENEMIES OF THE
VALLEY ROAD.
Unfair Attempts Made to
Bring It Into Dis-
favor.
PROTEST AT STOCKTON.
Unfounded Charges of Discrimi
nation Made Against
the Line.
ORIGIN OF THE OPPOSITION.
The Conditions Complained of Brought
About by the Southern
Pacific.
Opposition of a peculiar character, and
inspired solely by selfish motives, has
made itself manifest botli in this City and
in Stockton against the San Francisco and
SanJoaquin Valley Railroad. So far nas
this already gone that a protest was filed
at a recent meeting of the City Council of
Stockton against granting certain addi
tional privileges to tne Valley road, and
petitions are being circulated in San Fran
cisco, in Stockton and in the country im
mediately adjacent to the latter city
pledging the signers to withhold their
business from the Valley road and to give
it to the Southern Pacific In preference.
The ostensible basis for this onset upon
the great monopoly's first and only gen
uine competitor is set forth in the petition
filed with the StocKton Council, which
reads as follows:
To the Honorable the City Council of the City of
Stockton â Gentlemen: As property-owners iv
the City oi Stockton and engaged in business
therein, we respectfully protest against grant
ing; any more privileges to the so-called Valley
Railway Company, unless the discrimination
in the schedule of rates of freight against
Stockton shall be removed and not be re-estab
lished.
In this behalf we respectfully represent: In
wheat rates the Valley Railway Company dis
criminates against Stockton by at least 10
ceuts per ton in favor of Port Costa; in fact,
they simply treat Stockton as a way station.
Tate, for instance, their rates of freight from
Merced to Stockton and Port Costa:
Rate from Merced to Port Costa, including
unloading and transferring to barge at Stock
ton and unloading barge ai Port Costa, along
side ship or wharf. $2 20.
Rate from Merced to Stockton, but not in
cluding unlonding and transferring to barge at
Stockton, $1 70.
Cost to receiver at Stockton of unloading and
transferring to barge if wheat iÂ» put into ware
house at Siorston, 10 cents.
Rate of ireigiit by barge from Stockton to
i alongside ship or wharf atl'ort Costa, 50 cents;
total if 2 30.
Discrimination in ffavor of Port Coeta as
agninst Stockton receivers, 10 cents.
You will note from the above that receivers,
i like ourselves, of grain at Stockton have to do
| the unloading and transferring at their own
! cost, whereas such service is comparatively
| performed cratis by the Valley Railway Com
pany for receivers at Port Costa.
The Valley Railway's excuse for so handi
t capping Stockton as a grain center is that it
would be suicidal on the part of the Valley
Railway Company to increase the differential
Detween Stockton and Port Costa, for if they
were to do so_ the Southern Pacific Company
would immediately follow suit by mtking a
reduction in the all-rail freight to Port Costa.
The Southern Pacific Company does not ask
the Valley Railway Company to grant them
j the privilege ot breaking rates, and certainly
the Valley Railway' Company should, with all
| their vauntei expressions of independence, lot
I able to break rau-s without the consent of the
j Southern Pacific Company.
For some unaccountable reason the Valley
! Railway prefers to foster '.he Southern Pacific's I
I terminal, Port Costa, ior grain than foster
| Stockton, the town which by iv liberality to
! the Valley Railway made- the establishment of
I its road feasible. Considering what Stockton
has done for the Vall.y Railway it appears
outrageous that this railway company shouM
have so arranged its rates of freight as to in
-1 jure Stockton.
The Southern Pacific Company for a great
many years has kept Stockton as a wheat cen
ter on a parity with Port Costa, and it has
been the action of the Valley Railway that h.is
disturbed this parity. We consider that the
City Council, before bestowing further privi
leges on the Valley Railway Company, should
provide that such privileges shall not be used
to the cletriu-en: ot Stockton, as has been the
case with the other privileges granted to the
Valley Railway.
We think that one of the first conditions to
be exacted by Stockton in -riving away valu
able rights of way should be that there "should
be no arrangement of freight rates as to dis
criminate agp.iiist Stockton in favor of another
locality. The Valley Railway, instead of bene
fitting Stockton as a grain center, has taken
the initiative steps to destroy it as such. Tiie
City Council, having the power, owes to Stock
ton the exercising oi that power to check and
remove such initiative steps. Before tne
granting of any more privileges let It be pro
vided that Stockton shall not be discriminated
against in rates of freight, and that the
present discrimination shall be removed.
It may be that the Valley Railway repre
sentative, by the muddling of figures, will
demonstrate that the Valley Railway is not
discriminating against Stockton. We will un
deriake to prove to any intelligent man that
they are discriminating aeainst Btockton as
regards grain.
We therefore respectfully but earnestly pro
test against granting the additional franchises
and privileges sought or any other privilege
until assurance shall be given that the dis
crimination now existing against Stockton, its
wheat-buyers and wheat receivers and other
business interests shall be removed and satis
factory contract made providing against any
such discrimination in the future. Very re
spectfully yours,
Stockton Warehouse Company.
C. L. Otis, Manager.
A3 will be seen from the foregoing tne
rub of the whole trouble lies in the charge
of 10 cents a ton, made for handling the
wheat placed in storage at Stockton. This
j means that wheat placed in warehouses at
: Stockton and then'exported pays a charge
I of 10 cents a ton more than that ware
housed at and exported from Port Costa
I and warehouse pointss common to the
latter.
Those engaged in arousing opposition to
; the Valley road are trying to saddle the
â  blame for this condition of things upon
', the new road, when it is a notorious fact
I that the discrimination which Stockton
i suffers from is due to the action of the
I Southern Pacific in abolishing the charge
i for handling wheat at Port Costa, for tne
| purpose of drawing the entire wheat ex
port business from Stockton, and at the
same time handicapping the Valley road
on this cJass of freight. The actual re
sult has been that the Stockton ware
housemen have suffered from this move
of the Southern Pacific, tut the Valley
road has mar.aged to retain its full com
petitive power against its rival.
b fore the Valley road entered the field
the Southern Pacific charged 75 cents more
a ton to carry wheat to Port Costa from
the interior of the San .loaquin Vailey
than it did to Stockton. When the Valley
road issued its schedule of grain rate?,
cutting those of the Southern Pacific from
25 10 33}* per cent, it made the difference
between Stockton and Port Costa 50 cents.
Up to this time the Southern Pacific had
been making a charge for handling wheat
at Port Costa as well as at Stockton, but
when the Valley road cut the t,'rain rates
the Southern Pacific not only met the cut
but secretly abolished the charge for
handling wheat at Port Costa, thus creat
ing the discrimination against Stockton
by maintaining the charge for handling at
that roint.
In order to offset this discrimination,
the creation of the Southern Pacific, the
Valley road is now asked by the ware
housemen of Stockton to increase the dif
ference in the rates between Stockton ami
Port Costa to 60 cents per ton, so aa to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1896.
place Stocfeton on an equality with Port
Costa in tht matter of exporting wheat.
This, it is claimed by the Valley road
people, cannot be done. To attempt it,
they say, would be to drive all the busi
ness of this character to the Southern Pa
cific, whose differential between Stockton
| and Port Costa is only 50 cents, and thus
! the Valley road would lose this business,
I and not a pound of it would pass through
Stockton, as it would be taken out of the
valley by the way ot Lathrop. On the
other hand, should the Valley road re
duce its rates from valley points to Stock
ton by 10 cents, the cut. would promptly
be met by the Southern Pacific and the
present differential between Stockton and
Port Costa wouid thus be maintained,
without any advantage having accrued to
the warehousemen ot Stockton.
"We are oerfectly helpless in this mat
ter," said Vice-President Watt of the
Valley road in speaking of the condition
of affairs of which complaint is made;
"and the people who are stirring np this
feeling against us know perfectly well that
we are not at fault. Their motive is purely
selfish and the attack upon us simply ma
licious. There are two interests whose
representatives principally are instigating
this antagonism. These are the Stockton
Warehouse Company, owned by Girvin &
Eyre of this City, and the Union Trans
portation Company, of which Mr. Gillis
of Stockton is president and manager.
The coming of the Valley road has tended
to interfere, in their opinion, with the
profits they had been making previous to
its advent.
"One of the big savings effected for the
farmer by our road was the abolition of
tbe switching charges at Stockton, which
were 15 cents a ton. The Stockton Ware
house Company had a special contract
with the Southern Pacific Company
whereby they paid the railroad only 5
cents a ton. and were therefore in a posi
tion to make 10 cents more a ton on all the
grain they handled for the farmer than
j the other warehouses of Stockton. The
j loss of tiiis advantage to them is what
makes them sore against our road. They
lose sight, however, of the fact that what
; was their individual loss is the gain of
| every farmer who now ships wheat out of
| the valley.
"The animus of the Union Transporta
tion Company is even more apparent.
WLen we were ready to begin operating
| our road we made an arrangement with
| the California Navigation and Improve
ment Company to handle all our business
j between Stockton and San Francisco, as
I tnis company was the only one equipped
to handle the business. Manager Gillis of
the rival transportation company acknowl
edged that his company did not have an
adequate equipment to give the service re
! quired, but he desired that we should re
j frain from billing shipments through to
l San Francisco and that we should dump
i our freight at Stockton and let the rival
companies tnere fight for the business.
But this we could not do in justice to the
I patron? of our road, who couid not be ex
j pected to employ an agent at Stockton to
; look after the trans-shipment of their
j freight from there.
"Manager Giilis of the Union Transpor
tation Company makes no secret to us of
i his feeling against the Valley road for
: having made this contract with his rival
I and has stated to me personally that he
j would use every effort in his power to in
jure the interests of the Valley road."
Another of the Valley road officials
stated that Mr. Girvin of the firm of Gir
! vin & Eyre was personally circulating pe
| titions in this City pledging merchants
j who had freight for valley points to ship
jit over the Southern Pacific. Similar peti
tions, the officers of the Valley road hay?
information, are being circulated in and
about Stockton.
MUSIC FOR THE MISSION
A Successful Musicale Given
at the Association
Auditorium.
Ms. Strelitz Davis Makes Her Debut
on H.r R turn From
Berlin.
A very successful concert was given last
' night at the Association Auditorium for
the benefit of the Mission Y. M. C. A.
The body of the hall was well filled with
I listeners, who encored moat of the num
â  bers on the programme, and who vijor
j ously applauded all the musical fare pro
vided.
A feature of the entertainment was the
j reappearance of Mrs. Strelitz Davis, who
has been studying in Berlin for the last
, year and a half. She chose Liszt's "Hun-
I garian Rhap^odie," No. 10, as the medium
fjr pre-onting herself to the audience. t>he
played it w:th a dash and brilliancy
which won warm applause. Mrs. Strelitz
| Davis also gave a sympathetic rendering
I to the pianoforte score of a trio, opus 42,
j by Niels W. Gade.
The other players in the trio were A.
' Strelitz. violinist, and H. Strelitz, 'cellisu
j Margaret Davis, a very young pianist,
! played Weber's "Invitation to the Dance"
j and Schubert's "Impromptu," op 142, In
a very clever and appreciative manner.
Arruand Solomon, a violinist well
I known locally, gave a clever rendering of
a "Polonaise" in D major, by Wienawski.
As an encore he ulayed Sdolit's lovely
melody, "Rose Softly Blooming," and
rendered it so expressively that the audi
ence seemed to want a second encore.
Professor Roscoe Lucy accompanied Mr.
I Solomon very effectively. H. Strelitz won
an encore for his nieasing rendering of the
'cello solo, "Ellgie Kumraer." He was
accompanied by Mrs. Strelitz Davis.
Mme. Herniine Smith gave a forceful
rendering of Rubinstein's pianoforte solo,
"Waltz Caprice." to which she waoobliged
to respond with an encore. She also
played' Liszt's transcription of "Tann
j hauser."'
The vocalists who assisted all succeeded
in creating a favorable impression. The
California male quartet was encored, and
Mrs. E. M. Gallahoru and H. O. Page's
vocal duet, "Edenland," won much ap
plause. C. H. Randall accompanied the
la;ter vocalists.
Of the vocal soloists, Dr. R. W. Smith
sang Behrend's "Daddy" effectively, and
Rev. J. George Gibson was applauded for
his rendering of "O Restless Sea." Miss
Florence Wyman-Gardner's high ringing
soprano voice was listened to with the ap
preciation it merited. H. D. Page gave a
comic vocal sketch, "The Thomas Cat That
Came in ou' Back Yard."
Miss Elizabeth Bartlett, the only re
citer of tlie entertainment, gave a clever
readme of a atory, the seen.' of which was
laid in Russia.

was arrested in Spokane a few days ago,
and Wednesday night another was ar
rested in this City and is now in the tanks
at the City Prison awaiting the arrival of
an officer from Los Angeles to take him
back.
The man arrested is John J. McCarthy.
He came here about six weeks ago with a
woman named Mr?. Lffslie and engaged a
room at 11 Eddy street. Captain Lees, who
had been in constant communication with
Chief Qlass of Los Angeles, soon after
ward learned of his arrival and detailed
Detectives Dillon and Crockett to arrest
him.
It was not an easy task, as the bouse, 11
Eddy street, has an entrance also from
Market street, ana McCarthy was wary.
About two weeks ajjo he was seen to enter
the house, and a descent was made upon
what was thought to be his room. It
proved to be the wrong room and McCar
thy made his escape.
After that Policeman P. Sullivan, who
knew McCarthy, was detailed to assist
Dillon and Crockett, and day and nieht
both entrances to the house were covered
and the officers had instructions to follow
Mrs. Leslie wherever she went.
Thursday night, about 9 o'clock, she !
left the house by the Eddy street entrance
and walked up Powell street to Union i
square. She remained there for about an ;
hour and walked to the corner of Post |
street. A car came along and she boarded j
it and took a seat beside a man. Sullivan
bad boarded the car after her and recog- j
nized the man aB McCarthy. He promptly j
placed him under arrest, and quick as a
flasb McCarthy drew a revolver from his
pocket. Sullivan grappled with him,
threw him down and cailed upon the mule
passengers to assist him. A young man
went to bis assistance, and after a brief
struggle the handcuffs were put on Mc-
Carthy and he was dragged from the car.
Sullivan blew his whistle and Policeman
T. B. Gibson answered the call. McCarthy
was marched to the corner of Eddy and
Powell streets and the patrol wagon was
summoned and McCarthy was soon in
"the tanks,"
His trunk was later taken from the
Eddy-street lodging-house to the City
Prison. Tbe room which McCarthy had
occupied on Mission street was located
yesterday, but nothing was in it belonging
to McCarthy except some articles of cloth
ing. In the room at 11 Eddy street a hand
vise and some files were found and taken
to police headquarters.
Captain Lees refused yesterday to per
mit any one to see McCarthy, as lie wanted
the officers who were coming from Los
Angeles to ha*'e the opportunity first of ;
interviewing him. The captain said he :
had a falK with McCarthy yesterday I
morninp and he admitted tuat he knew j
"Quirk" Jones, who is known as an all- j
round crook. Jones owned the sa'oon at j
112 Commercial street, from which the I
tunneling operations were commenced to J
reach the bank.
McCarthy is a New Yorker an I is now '
about 36 years of age. He is a sailor and i
claims to have been a mate on vessels j
traaintr to South American pom and also |
from Liverpool, England, to European
ports. He is an athlete and pugilist and j
has at different times fought in the rinÂ«,
by which he became known to Policeman j
Sullivan, who is something of an athlete '
himself.
McCarthy's criminal record so far as
known is not very great. He is known as i
a general all-round thief. He was arrested
In Seattle in 1892 with "Shorty" Adams,
and Ed, alias "Deafy," Connelly, for crack- j
ing a safe. Adams and Connelly got seven |
years each and McCarthy escaped punish- j
ment by turning State's evidence. About
two years ago ho was arrested in Los
Angeles for shootin? a man in a â saloon,
but succeeded in getting an acquittal.
Tbe attempt to rob the bank in May
last created a great sensation at the time.
The robbers began tunneling from the
cellar of Jones' saloon, 112 Commercial i
street, and had excavated a distance of 1
about forty yards when the discovery was '
made by the police. There was $.500,000
Coin in tbe bank vaults and tie robbers j
haO reached the arched chamber beneath
them.
They apparently not only contemplated j
robbery, but also the covering up of all
traces of, their crime by blowing up the
buildings in the vicinity, as they had
thirty-one sticks of giant powder, three
boxes of percussion caps and 200 feet of
fuse.
It was believed that about a dozen men
were implicated in the attempt. The
planning was done in this City, and the
directions sent out from here by two
noted crooks. Matheny and Ryerson. Mc-
Carthy is supposed to have been one of
the leaders of the gang of tunnelers, and
his arrest, is considered very important.
There Are several other men to be ar
rested yet, and it is i.oped that McCarthy's
capture may lead to their identification.
LOS ANGELES DELIGHTED.
News of the Capture of the Bank
Robber In This City Well
Received.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 10.â The
police of this city, and especially Chief
Glass, are delighted over the news from
San Francisco of the arrest of one John
McCarthy, alias Bigelow, alias Madden,
implicated in the famous tunnel scheme
to rob the First National Bank of this city.
Detective Bradish of this city is now on
his way to San Francisco armed with a
warrant charging McCarthy with burg
lary. In the opinion of the police here
McCarthy was the ringleader and planner
of the attempted bank robbery referred to,
which in many respects has no parallel in
the annals of crime for boldness, deter
mination and intrepidity.
On the evenitiEr of June 6 'ast this city
was stirred from center to c rcumference
by tne astoundine announcement that a
gasg of burglars had dug an underground
tnnnel from the basement of a saloon on
Commercial street to a point beneath the
money vaults of the First National Bank,
which fronts on Main street and is 175 feet
from the place of starting. This work
from its nature must have required many
weeks if not months to accomplish and
was carried forward under the very eyes of
the pol'ce and the public, who had daily
access to the saloon affording the blind
for all the work When the discovery was
made it wa> too late to rapture me dirt
diggers. I\.< y iial smeiled a mice and
skipped, leaving their :oolÂ«, apparatus and
dynamite stores Debind them. The police,
detectives nnd everybody else was at sea
as to who could have nlanned and executed
I this marvelous work. The whole job
smacked of experts and there was talk
i gn'ore of a number of well-known bank
i robbers, including the Matbeny-Ryerscn
gang.
The police found an idle fellow here
named Stephens, some days afterward,
and put him in jail, but after long search
ing for clews to connect Stephens with the
daring deed it was abandoned and the
prisoner released. Only a few days ago
Fred L. Jones, who formerly conducted
the saloon at the Commercial-street end
of the tunnel, was arrested at Spokane,
Wash., and brought back, and is now in
jail awaiting his preliminary examination
I on the charge of complicity in the at-
I tempted crime. Jones was seen to-day
after the arrival of tbe news of McCarthy's
arrest by a Call correspondent and asked
if he had beard about it. He expressed
I inoifference to the arrest, saying, "I don't
care how many people they arrest." When
i asked if he knew a John McCarthy,
Bigelow, Madden or Matheny he declined
ito answer. "Jimmy" Madden is now in
! State prison at Foisom, and it is said
! olairns to know every man concerned in
I the attempted tunnel robbery.
FIVE SHOTS FIRED.
Michael Shay '. mptiei His Revolver
â Without Effect at Jack Uouley In
a Mission Saloon.
Felix Dugan's saloon, southwest corner
of Sixtb and Howard streets, was the scene
ofasbootini; affray Wednesday evening,
in which Mike Shay tired five shots at
Jack Dooley. None of the shots took
effect.
Snav was promptly arrested by Officers
Regan and Marshall and booked at the
Southern station on a charge of assault to
murder. He tells a tale to the effect that
he and a man named Jack Lo^an called at
Dooley's home on Clementina street yes
terday afternoon, and that Dooley's wife
gave Lopan $2 to hire a buggy for herseif
and sister to go to the races at Ingleside.
Logan and hiojseli, so Shay says, then
went to inÃleside in a cart. While there
S'iay told Dooley of Loeran's receiving
money from Dooley's wife for buggy hire.
Dooley grew angry and wanted to fight
Shay, who left the cart and came home in
a car.
He ?ays he then went to Dugan's saloon,
when Logan and Dooley came in together,
with tbree or four more, and assaulted
him. He was struck in the eye, and con
sequently tired tbe shots in self-defense.
The arresting officers state that Dooley
and Shay were quarreling in the saloon
and that the former invited Shay to the
siilewnlk for settlement. As soon as Dooley
was outside Shay stepped to the door and
did the shootinjr.
Dooiey's version could not be had, as he
escaped arrest by fleeing. Au officer was
detailed to arrest him at his home. 135
Courtland avenue. Shay is a horse- tamer,
24 years old.

The Health Authorities Make Up for

The Police Department has tacitly
acquiesced in the request of the Health
Department that all regular and special
policemen having regular beats be made
to act as health inspectors, and 10,000
blanks are now being printed at the re
quest of the Board of Health for the use of
the patrolmen.
Several days ago the members of the
Health Board were informed that the
Board of Supervisors had by an ordinance
made reeuiar and special police ex-omcio
health inspectors, and the lollowing letter
was sent to the board by the Police Com
missioners:
Gentlemen: The Board of Health of this City
desires to express its obligation to your honor
able body and its thorough appreciation of
the efficient services rendered by the Police
Department in the matter of securing and in
creasing the public health of this City.
Inasmuch as there are only six regular
health inspectors, a number utterly made- j
quate for a city seven miles square, and mas- ;
much as by order 1601 of the Board of Super
visors "every regular and special police officer
having a regular beat shall by ex-officio health
inspector," the board requests your aid and
co-operation In rnakintr a house to house in

a view ol determining every building, struc
ture, premise or part of the City which is an
unsanitary condition am. menaces the health
or life of its inhabitants.
Should your honorable body co-operate with
this board we will furbish all necessary blanks
and instructions for the proper andefficient
accomplishment of a thorough inspection of
the City. We are, dear sirs, yours very truly,
The Board of Health op the City and County
of tAN Francisco, Cal.
Captain Healy of the Police Depart
ment canea at the Health Office yester
day and requested to be furnished with
the blanks that are used by Health In
spectors. He intimated that the request
i>f the board would be complied with by
the Police Department, whereupon Secre
tary Godchaux at once ordered 10,000
blank forms.
This means that every policeman In San

"CALIFORNIA WILL SURELY GIVE A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY AT"
To obtain the truest, clearest view one must ascend to a commanding height. On
this principle the subjoined expressions from Senators from ail sections of the State
upon the political outlook will be read with peculiar interest. Their position as the
political centers of their respective sections gives them unsurpassed opportunities of
receiving and imparting reliable reports of local sentiment. At the same time their
experience and reputation would forbid any distortion of facts or misunderstanding
of existing conditions.
As a matter of fact, these opinions of State Senators kindly furnished The Call
are most valuable, as well as inspiriting, from the standpoint of the grand party of
patriotism, protection and prosperity. They indicate that the people have got their
second thought and are steadily rejecting the sophistries of a desperate Democracy.
They show, too. just in what sections protection is absolutely necessary for the life of
particular industries. Fruit, wool, mining, lumber and other great interests cry aloud
for McKinley and stable government. In the cities the "solid middle class," the back
bone of the people, are rejecting Bryanism as a cheap bait calculated to decoy to his
ruin tde honest voter. From north, south and east come words or wise good cheer.
"The people are showing they are wideawake to their own interests. The Repub
lican banner will be undoubtedly crowned with victory. Immense good has been
done by the press in circulating the truth. McKinley is the workiugman's friend.
Let the good work go on," is the encouraging teno* of the reports.
Students of comparative statistics will also find much matter of interest in the
â¢stimated vote of the respective districts.
Altogether, from this â perhaps the most valuable symposium yet offered in the
local political campaign â a feeling of confidence in ultimate Republican success is
likely to impress every intelligent reader.
LASSEN, MODOC, SHASTA, SISKIYOU, TRINITY â
Second District.
That Section, According to Senator J. M. Cleaves, Demands' Protection
for Lumber and Mines.
REDDING. Cal., August 27, 1896.
Char!?- M. Shortridge, Editor Call: The prospect for Republican success in Shasta
and in the Second Senatorial Dis-,
Htrict is good and is daily improving.
I The most of our voters are intelligent,
Hhone?t, thoughtful and patriotic miners,
Hthat can be depended upon, in an emer-
Hgency such as now faces the Republican
Hparth, to vote for the best interest of the
Hpeople of the United States. They feel
Hthat the last three years of Democracy is
Hall they ever need, and when asked if they
Hwant four years more of it usually answer
Hno.
The Populists are discouraged and to a
I certain extent demoralized on account of
Ha growing belief that their party has been
Hsold out by its leaders. The fact that
H- I*1 '*" mocracy is the same article, whether
â menTe lumbering interests, Iron mines,
and wool is especially in need of
protection, ana the average voter realizes that protection is the most important prin
ciple involved in this campaign. The development of onr sugar-beet industry is ol
vast and peculiar importance; and in fact, the whole Republican platiorm advocates
nothing that is not locally demanded and generally recognized as progressive. The
contest here is straight atgresive Republicanism vs. negative Democracy.
Congressman Barham is making a gallant and winning canvass in this part of the
State, with many thincs in his favor. Coming as he does, after being tried and found
true to hiÃ promises, so well prepared with intelligent information on the silverques
tion, he is successfully explaining the fallacies of that doctrine. He stands squarely
on the Republican platform and firmly believes that the only relief for silver mast
come by and through the acts of the Republican party. His course has been so
straight, his integrity so unquestionable that his reelection is almoet assured. The
Populists have virtually no criticisms to make, the Republcians are well satisfied with
his Congressional record and the Democrats question only his protection policy, which
down deep in their hearts, they earnestly hope may win.
William McKinley representing the central political ideaâ protectionâ beinp a
thorough American; an old and honored comrade of the Grand Army; a safe, able
and experienced statesman; and having greater ability to restore the confidence of
Americans in America than any man alive to-day, and having for his party's motto
the grandest combination of principles ever advocated, patriotism, prosperity and
protection, will be elected. J. M. GLEaVES, Senator Second District
Senator W. A. Shlppee Is Fully Convinced of the Strong Necessity for a
Republican President and a Protective Policy.
Senator W. A. Sblppee Is one of the most active leaders in his section and has
every opportunity of "sizing op" the
political situation there. He thinks that I
the outlook for a Republican victory at I
the polls in November is more than favor- I
able. In that part of the State, rich in I
natural resources and enriched by the toil I
of far-seeing horticulturists, he says it I
would be strange indeed if the people did I
not see the cogency of Republican reason- I
inc. While the idle echoes of Democratic I
special pleading have penetrated to his I
section it has not, ho says, carried think- I
era off their feet. They are not prepared I
for the sake of a petty and problematical I
advantage to throw away the fruits of a I
/ife of labor, when by electing William I
McKinley President they may secure I
the benefits of their toil for themselves I
and children. Fruit men and agricultur- I
ists of every shade, miners and supporters I
of kindred industries are showing cvi- I
dence of an awakening. They have heard I
the words of the great Ohioan and are re- I
calling the "fat years" of previous Repub- I
lican administrations. Clevelandism has I
become a by-word for misrule and Bryan- L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^H
ism with its experimental jugglery with the sensitive currency of the country bids
fair to come into even greater disrepute. The conservative counsels of experience are
prevailing and the Senator has no hesitation in predicting the ultimate triumph of
the Republican party of progress. Even the professed Democrats are trembling in
the balance, and before November many of them will have joined the grand old
party's ranks.
SUTTER, YOLO, YUBA-Sixth District.
"It Is Only the Unthinking," Says Senator Eugene Aram. "Who Fool
ishly Cry, 'Anything for a Change.' "
The Bixth District comprises the counties
I of Yolo, Yuba and Sutter.
My acquaintance in Yuba and Sutter is
I much more limited than in Yolo, where I
I reside, and it is probably due to this fact
I that my standing is so much better in the
I remote counties in my district than at
I home.
And theorizing along this line per-
I haps we can account for the waning of
I the Bryan boom.
The people hare been getting better
I acquainted with him of late. On National
I issues Yolo and Yuba are always con-
I ceded to go Democratic, while Sutter is
I slightly Republican, and I think the
I Bryan vote will run about with the Cieve-
I land vote of four years ago.
Republicans are standing well in line,
I and leading Democrats who will vote for
I McKinley are numerous.
Truly, the Democrats are losing some
I of the most staunch men of their party,
I men of sterling worth and integrity, men
I who do not believe in running after
I strange cods, who do not think it wise to
I launch onr old ship of state upon an un

New County Conventions to Be Called

BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Sept. 10.â For
several days past politicians in both the
Democratic and Populist parties have been
hard at work trying to fuse on candidates
for Superior Judge and the Assembly.
The Democratic candidates for those offices
handed in their resignations and thÂ« I'op
labeled '"tariff leform," "free trade," or
"free silver," has a most discouraging
effect upon Populists and especially upon
those who were formerly identified with
the Republicans and many of the latter
throughout this section are not going to
assist in the election of Mr. Bryan.
This portion of the State with its im-

ulist Assemblymen did the same, but the
Populist Judge absolutely and peremptor
ily refused to come down.
To-day a joint committee of four from
each party met to discuss the situation,
the meeting being attended by Thomas V.
Cator, who gave advice on the subject.
After a lengthy discussion a resolution
was adopted recommending that the
county conventions of both parties be re
convened on Saturday, September 19, for
the purpose of taking "action in the prem
ises. There are strong factions in both
parties which are entirely opposed to
fusion, and it is probable that both organ
isations will be split on the question.
Cator addressed a large open-air meet
ing here this evening.
Knight at Santa Cru*.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Sept. 10.â A
rousing meeting under the auspices of the

known and untried Â«ea. But among the laboring classes, among the horny-handed
sons of toil, who earn their daily bread by the sweat of an honest brow, we find a
different feeling, a different sentiment, and uniess a change is brought about between
now and the ides of November the Democrats will secure a large portion of this vote.
"Anything for a change" seems to be an argument of great weight. They seem to
have forgotten the long era of prosperity under Republican rule and protection; for
gotten that in the name of Democracy a roost radical change was brought about
when Grover Cleveland was first elected President; forgotten that the surplus in our
treasury soon melted away; forgotten that it is during Democratic administrations
that our industries have been paralyzed, factories closed down and labor deprived of
an opportunity to earn an honest dollar; forgotten the unÃept promises of four years
ago. Like Patrick, who was told if he would vote for Cleveland he would never work
any more, said: "I voted for Cleveland and have not done a day's work since."
None feel the effects of hard times more keenly than the laboring man. Free
silver has a sound of melody for him who knows what it is to go hungry. But in all
seriousness I would say to such: If you had been engaged in a lucrative business
and by a change of managers and business policy your enterprise was fast approach
ing bankruptcy what would you do? What would any sane business man do? It is
needless to ask. You would simply go back to the old management to iook for pros
perity again. Our Government i*> simply a large business enterprise.
Clevelandism has been a failure. Bryanism is replete with vague and untried
theories, while McKinleyism represents the old management. "Protection to Our
Industries" is the t>arty slogan which will lead us back to prosperity.

CLOVE RDALE, Cal., Sept. 7, 1896.
Charles M. Shortridar, Editor Call: To forecast the coming political results of So-
County is a peculiarly difficult un-
â paxtythat we have been trained to watch
tne last thirty years? The candidates
for the Assembly In the Seventeenth Diitrict appear to be Staley, who wants a renorui
nation, and he made a good member two years ago; also Professor Nielson would Jiko
a two months' visit to Sacramento; also Frank Mather would not object and he is
quite popular with the boys and would poll a good vote.
In the Sixteenth District Mr. Price would like to be returned, and as he made an
active and valuable member at the last session his wishes may be respected. Mr.
Meecham of Petaluma will also be a candidate before that convention, and if the
choice should fall to him the Republicans of that district would make no mistake, as
he is an energetic Republican and one who sticks to his convictions, for he knows that
they are generally right.
Any of these gentlemen would well represent Sonoma County and will be quite
sure of an election unless our opponents make a close combination and find some
good men to oppose, and then the chances are doubtful and 'tis anybody's fight.
To analyze the result on the National ticket in advance is at this time and under
existing circumstances a very difficult matter except to give a guess conclusion. As
far as 1 can observe nearly all voters of standing who have something to lose and who
earnestly desire the welfare of all the people of our country, such men without regard
to former political affiliations will sustain the party of protection and prosperity, and
1 find numbers of former Democrats who take that view, but former Populists don't
seem so open to conviction; they sticic to their new faith with a persistency that
woul'l be commendable in a better cause.
We aho have a class of voters who have benn caught by the frenzy or furor of the
Chicago convention and carried off their feet for a time, but many of these will read
McK-nley's letter of acceptance and see the folly of following after such strange gods,
and will eventually conclude to place their votes and faith with the party that is try
ing to give the laboring man a better chance in the race of life.
For Congress Jndge Barham will, if he works hard, be a sure winner by a fair ma
jorityâsay 1200â in his district. He is a good man and has so far made a cood record.
I predict a small majority for McKinley in Sonoma County. Respectfully yours,
J. C. Holloway.
The Solid Middle Class, Says Senator J. H. Mahoney, Are for McKinley
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Aug. 29, 1896.
Charles M. Shortridge, Editor Morning Call â Sib: In reply to your letter of the
25th inst., addressed to me, asking for my^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
vie ?:s concern inz the political situation iH
will state that the present condition ofl
affairs never seemed more favorable forH
the success of the Republican party in theH
State and especially in the Fourth Con-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B
gressional District-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
My opinion on the political status in
t^id district is not only based upon ex
perience gained by long acquaintanceship
with the Republican voters of the
"Fourth." but in addition thereto I have
taken pains, both by observation and from
conversations had with leading Demo
crats residing therein, to confirm the opin
ion predominant in my district among all
classes, that both the Republican electors
and our nominee for Congress will this
year gain increased strength by the acces
sion to the Republican ranks of hundreds
of Democrats, which augurs well for the
election of McKinley and Hobart.
I 111 in 111 I II 111 l ll I 111 II iiniiÃ
of the Stale wherein I reside belongH
largely to the great middle class, who are.l
I mifht truthfully say, close students of|
political economyâ fully capable of studying the political problems submitted foi
their decision and of arriving at a just and sensible conclusion.
They have as a class more to fear than the very wealthy (judging by their last
four years' experience), the threatened repetition of National misrule and the advent
of hare-brained political schemers, who seek the control of the Government with a
determined purpose and an acknowledged avowal of uprooting everything which is
calculated to promote peace and restore prosperity to our country.
It is, perhaps, needless for me to remark that the middle classes comprise the
great majority upon whom rests the burden of taxation. That they are a thrifty and
a common-sense class the numerous savings deposits and real-estate holdings (as
exemplified by the savings banks' report and the Assessor's books) amply testify.
In their solid ranks, therefore, there cannot be found voters so lacking in discre
tion as to be led astray by the sophistry, wild, impassioned harangues and false
promises of those would-be political leaders, who, ignoring the needs of the Nation
and either lacking a knowledge of finance or cunningly concealing historical facts'
seek to rend asunder the fraternal bonds which link together the people of the North'
the East, the South an.l the West. They therefore refuse to be blinded by the clouds'
of oratorical dust raised by the declaimers of false issues, and realizing keenly the
present depression in commerce they rightfully attribute it to the source whence it
sprung, viz.: the present administration.
There is throughout the entire Fourth District a steadily growing feeling that the
credit of the Nation must be maintained,' and consequently the unanimous sentiment
favors sound money.
Earnest and effective work is being done therein and I feel very confident in
stating that when the polls have closed on November 3 next the Fourth Congressional
District will have redeemed itself and will stand prominently forward in the ranks of
the Republican districts of this State. I remain respectfullyyours,
J. H. MAHONEY.

Â»tr Club at Calittoga.
NAPA, Cal., Sept. 10.â A McKinley
and Hobart club was last Monday night
organized at Calistoga, with a member
ship of 150.
It is the firtt Republican club ever
formed in that precinct, and new names
are daily added to its roll. The officers
are: President, F. G. Huskey; secretary,
E. Light; treasurer, M. Murphy; vice
president, C. J. B. Moore.

dertaking at this time, as our nominations
are not yet made, nor is theicanvasa fairly
begun. We have a larÂ«e voting popula
tion who have inherited their Democratic
politics from their Missouri fathers during
and since the war, and they are not always
open to conviction.
Dp to 1880 and 1884 Ihis county was sure
to go Democratic, but since those years,
through the constant ana zealous work of
such men as Colonel Byington of Santa
Rosa, Sam Cassady of Petaluma, John
Beliach of Healdsburg, valiantly aided by
the Sapta Rosa Republican, the Petaluma
Argus and the Healdsburg Tribune, the
county was completely redeemed to the
cause of Republicanism.
At the present time the Argus and some
of its weak-kneed friends are camping
with our old enemies and are trying to
turn the stream of Democracy into a new
channel, thinking thereby that the new
silver waters will be pure and sweet for
the cause of the laboring people. Can
they change the spots on the leopard, or

Charles M. Shorlridge, Editor Call â Sib; The conditions prevailing at present in

The issues to be decided at the Novem

above, extremely favorable and the timeH
is not far distant when Tuolumne CountyM
will taKe her place in the Republican col-H

while the Republican vote has almost cor-H

There is no doubt in my mind that the!
people need only to understand to rejectH
the misleading proffers of a discredited^
Democracy. Cleveland's administration^
was not so productive of prosperity thatH
the promises of his party should be trusied^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^l
to-day. On the contrary people are likely to be more distrustful this year becanss
the promises are, on their face, impossible of fulfillment and only made to be broken.
With an active campaign carried on here by able Republican statesmen daring the
next two months I believe many converts can be made to the Republican cause and
in exact ratio to this missionary work being done thoroughly or the reverse will

Protection to American industry finds a warm indorsement among our stockmen
and fruit farmers. It is no dead issue here, as will be demonstrated at the polls.
The parleying, dickering and face- making attending the efforts at fusion between
the Popocrats and Silvercrats have disgusted and estranged not a few of those who
once intended voting for Bryan. A cordial hatred exists between the leaders who
want to fuse on Bryan, but do not know how it can be comfortably done.
Shouid the Populists name the fusion candidate for Congress in this district many
Democrats will either vote for Bowers or not vote at all for that position.
While the opposition is "chewing the rag" the Republicans are organizing, and
are already actively at work. Our local headquarters are open, our banner spans the
street and our convention to nominate Assemblymen and Supervisors has been called
for September 21. Our new committee will then push the good work, already well
begun by the present organization.
To retain Fresno in the Republican column will be our aim, and our work will bt

The General Sentiment Is for Bimetallism on an International Agree-

SUTTER CREEK, Cal., Sept. 3, 1896.^H
Charles M. Shoriridge, Editor Callâ Sib: In reply to your letter of the 25th nit, of|
inquiry about the political forecast of tfiis^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
section at the coming election, will say
that as far as my observation goes the pen-H
tral sentiment is for free coinage of silverH
or rather for bimetallism through an in-H
ternational agreement. The Republicans,^
as a rule, are not doing much loud talkingH
on the street corners, and when one hearsM
loud talk on the street in favor of f rceH
silver, and nothing else, you can mostH
every time guess it is a kind of DemocratH
who always supports the platform and the!
nominees of his party, but the better classH
of Democrats are doing a lot of thinking, I
I might say "sawing wood," and whatH
way they will vote on election day no one I
knows save themselves. For the Kepubli-H
cans I think a large number are for freal
coinage of silver, in fact I know a large I
majority are for bimetallism, but theyH
want it to come in the right way, and in I
a way that it will not distress the Nation I
or cause a panic, and they believe that itH
can only come through the Republican I
party, the same as all beneficial measures I
for ttie people have come in the past. I^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
might relate here a little incident that happened near the city of Stockton a short
time ago, which was just told me, and shows the consistency of the loud-mouthed
Democrat in talking about free silver, and it being the money of the poor people, and
of the farmer, and the laboring man, and all other delusive terms he could think of.
And the man who was doing all of this loud talking was a poor Democratic farmer
who had just sold a small band of cattle to a Stockton butcher, and the amount he
was to receive for his cattle was the large sum of $153, and the cashier wai counting
out his money for him, which was $150 in gold and $3 in silver. But the farmer was
so busy talking about free silver and the money of the people, that it was good enough
for him or anybody else, and as he did not at the time notice the cashier getting his
money ready for him, for he wai too busy talking for the poor people, and the cashier
waited awhile for him to receive his money, but he being so busy with his argument
for the time forgot what he was there for. So the cashier thought he would give him
a practical trial. So he took back the gold coin be had counted out for him and put it
back in the drawer and wrote acneck on a bank to pay the bearer 153 silver dollars. The
farmer took the check, not scrutinizing it close enough to notice the silver part of it.
He went to the bank to get his money on the check, and the paying-teller counted
out for him 153 silver dollars, and he looked at him in astonishment and said, ''Why, I
did not bring a wagon to get this small amount of money. I don't want silver, 1 want
gold." "But," said the paying-teller of the bank, "your check is payable in silver
dollars." And while he was looking at the check he had accepted in payment for his
cattle the cashier who gave it to him gently tapped him on the shoulder and said, "If
silver ii good enough for me it surely is good enough for you." He took his silver
dollars and walked away, but not happy.
If the Democrats did not have silver to talk about I don't know what they could
say, for certainly they can't refer to their President Cleveland with quite as much
pride as the Republicans can to their last President, Harrison. That is enough to say
and the people will surely express their wish in this section while they think the free
coinage of silver will be best for the country, but they want it to come in the right
- way, and to stay, and that way will be through the Republican party. Yours truly,

SAN FRANCISCO-Twentieth District.
Senator Eugene F. Bert Says That '.McKlnley's Election Is Expected to
Unlock the Hoarded Capita! of the Country.
CharU^^hortridge^ditoi^al^i^^ lng to your 'letter of August 25, wilt
I state that the present outlook in the
I Twentieth Senatorial District gives assur-
I ance of an increased Republican vote and
I a consequent Republican majority. I was
I born and have lived nearly all my life in
I the district I now represent and have
I a wide acquaintance in the two Assembly
I districts which comprise this Senatorial
I District, and my judgment as to the out-
I come of the voting is formed from per-
I sonal interviews with a large number of
I voters, many of whom are young men
I who will vote for the first time at the
I coming election.
Apart from the political and patriotic
I ties which bind the men of this district to
I the fortunes of the Republican party,
I Major McKinley himself is personally
I very popular. His., public career has been
I closely studied by the intelligent men of
I all parties, and he is regarded as the
I leader that the country needs at this par-
I ticular time.
There is no defection from the Republi-
I can ranks by reason of the free-silver
L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^l promises of the Chicago convention. It
Is the expressed sense of voters I have interviewed that the Republican party is the
true champion of silver. The maintenance at par with gold of the vast volame of
silver now in circulation counts for much in sound money calculations.
The voters in the Twentieth Senatorial District want to see a return of the
prosperity which existed under President Harrison's administration, and tney are
confident that a Republican victory next November will unlock the boarded capital
of the country and open avenues of employment all along the line of material
industry. Very truly yours, ' EUGENE F. BERT. ,
Senator Ell S. Denlson Says There Are Local Differences, but the
Result Will Undoubtedly Be McKinley.
Charles M. Shortridge, Editor CaWâ Sib: California will follow Vermont. So far as
I can judge, and I take a great interest in
politics, daily additions are being made to
the Republican party in this State. Men
on both sides of the bay whom I have con
sidered to be stanch Democrats have sur
prised me by saying that the only safe
guard for the future is McKinley. I have
written to Mr. Hsnna this morning, and I
have assured him that California is for
McKinley and that the local disputes in
some of the counties possess no signifi
cance as regards the National ticket.
There will be many surprises next No
vember, and States that have been hith
erto monopolized by Democrats will be
found in the Republican procession.
Because we had two candidates here
for the Congressional nomination, and be
cause other counties have their little fac
tional fights, attempts are being made to
have it appear that the party is disrupted.
Such an insinuation is false. Alameda
County will, I believe, eive a larger Re
publican majority than she ever did.
Why should not she do so? As the Demo
crats here have not mustered sufficiently
â trong to hold a single meeting to ratify the Chicago platform, it does not look as it
there -were many of them left.
Much has also been said about the split in the southern part of the State. There
is no split as far as party fealty is concerned. There are local differences, but they
only seem to make the party adhere more loyally to the goneral cause.
The meeting at Loa Angeles about which so much that is untruthful has been said
was one of the largest and most enthusiastic political meetings I ever attended. There
were a few Bryan men in the hall, and they had not the common-sense or decency to
behave like gentlemen, but they represented nothing, and it is nonsense to suppose
that their presence had any effect on the Republican party. The meeting was open to
all, and nearly everybody in the hall were Republicans.
When the campaign opened I sent for 7000 McKinley buttons, and I have given
away all but 1000. I have not distributed them carelessly, but only to people who are
responsible for what they say and do. I have been greatly surprised at some of the
men who are now wearing them, as I never thought they would accept a McKinley
button. Before November I snail have given away 5000 more, aud on election day
12,000 voters will be wearing my buttons.
To an intelligent man there can be no doubt as to the success of the McKinley-
Hobart ticket in November. E. S. DENISON.
KERN, SAN LUIS OBlSPOâ Thirty-fourth District.
Senator S. C. Smith Tells Why the Agriculturists of His Section Are for
Protection.
Charles 3f. Shorlridgc, Editor CollâSis.: Had I writtten you of the political out-
in this district two weeks ago I
Bshould have said that we would barely
Hhold up the Republican vote of two years
Hago â a Republican plurality of from 200
Ito 300. But the outlook- at this date is
Hmuch better. At nr-t it looked as though
Iwe would lose some votes in the mining
I districts, but later reports indicate that
Hsuch will not be the case to any appre-
Hciable extent.
This county is composed of mountain
Hand valley lands. In the former, the oc-
Hcupations are mining, stock-raising and a
I little farming; intne valley It is farm ins,
Hstock-raising and horticulture. At the
I close of the Harrison administration, one
lof the largest.and most profitable busi-
I nesses was sheep-raising. In the spring
lof 1893, when the "free wool" party came
Binto power, the sheep of this county num-
Hbered three-quarters of a million head
I and were worth $2,000,000. At the pres-
I ent time there are not 200,000 bead in the
I county, and they have been selling at
Hfrom 90 cents to $1 25 per head. Men who
identiiied with the wool shiD-
Kentsteiniietha^helosso^asbTotbis county in the destruction of this business
is not a cent less than $600,000 a year. When*the flock-master was getting good prices
for his wool and mutton be was a liberal patron of the farmers who had hay, pastur
age and stubble to sell. He paid good prices and was a cash customer; now he buys
little or no bay or pasturage, and paye less than the cost of production for it.
These facts have brought the tariff question very close to the farmers, and they do
not believe that "the tariff is not an issue this year." In a county of 12,000 popula
tion, the loss of 9600,000 a year in cold cash is a very serious matter.
This is also an important cattle-feeding county. Until recently the farmers with
great fields of alfalfa in the valley have bought stock cattle in the hills and fattened
them for the market; now they are going to Mexico for their supply of lean steers to
feed. Our stock-raisers have learned that during the four years of the McKinley tariff
of $10 a head on cattle the importations were but an average of 4020 head per year; with
tbe duty reduced to 20 per cent ad valorem they are coming in at the rate of 200,000
head per year, and the principal importers are the Kern County Land Company,
and Miller & Lux of this county.
Here the farmers and stockmen are again brought very close to the tariff question
and they are seeing very plainly that the McKinley idea of a tariff is not solely in the
interests of the Eastern "trusts" and "combines," so called.
Our horticulturists are aware of the loss of protection they have suffered, and also
painfully aware of the loss of markets in the Eastern cities, caused, as they believe,
by the depression of business in the manufacturing centers. Where formerly fresh
fruits found ready sale at good prices, now a few carloads glut the market and prices
are ruined. These people have got over the idea that the tariff is a thing that only
affects ihe Eastern "baron."
over the selection of the two candidates
for Superior Judge.
The aspirants for these honors are ex
ceedingly numerous since the union of
forces between the Democrats and Popu
lists and no less than five of Santa Rosa's
attorneys are already deep in the fight,
with three other towns to hear from.
The Populists, having no judicial tim
ber will ask for ihe two Assemblymen
and one Supervisor. This modest request
is meeting with profound disapproval
from leading Democrats, and a big row is
looked for Monday.

The silver question is not receiving as much attention as It aid a fortnight ago.
There are not a few friends of the white metal here, but they cannot make it appear
that free coinage would produce as much new labor ana new business throughout the
country as a change in the tariff would. Many people have learned, not a little to
their surprise, that a very large amount of silver has been coined right along since the
act of '73, that that act did not "destroy half the money of the country," and that the
present free coinage countries of the world ao not present very tempting examples for
our imitation.
In conclusion I can say that the Republicans are entering upon the work of the
campaign with a great deal more zeal than either the Democrats or Populists. Every
man in the party seems to feel that his business, be it great or small, will be directly
affected by the election of McKinley and Hobart, his shoulder is to the wheel to
accomplish this end, and neither of the other parties is half so zealous. It is un
aoubtedly true that the "Popuocratic" jumble of tne other ticket is proving discour
aging to both factors, Democrats and Populists. Yours truly,

The Political Outlook, Says Senator Beard, Seems Particularly Encour
aging From a Republican Standpoint.
CEJsTERVILLE, Cal., Sept. 7, 1896.
Charles M. Shorlridge, Editor Callâ Sin: The political outlook in this section seems
particularly encouraging and I can safely
say that in my recollection there has never
â  been a campaign that has given such on
â  niistakable evidence of a Republican ma
â  iority as the present one. In one precinct
â  I know of eight Democrats who have come
â  out for Major McKinley, and this is a good
â  index to judge by. I think Alameda
â  County will pive the largest Republican
â  majority that it has ever polled.
I It only requires time to enable voters to
â  find out that there is a conspiracy afoot to
â  deceive them. Already some of the more
I wideawake Democrats are coming over to
I the only party that has proved itself true
Ito the people. Republican principles are
â  founded upon experience. They have
â  given voters years of prosperity, peace,
â  progress and plenty in the past. Why
â  should the people refuse to trust them
I now? As a matter of fact loyalty will as
â  sert itself on this occasion as it has in the
I past. The great name of McKinley, so
I pregnant with memories of a wise protec-
I tive policy is, drawing old and new ad-
herents with irresistible force. Every
day adds to the Republican strength, and the Bryan boom seems to be flattening
out. The people seem to realize the fact that it is not an abundance of money that
is wanted, so much as an opportunity of earning it. Respectfully yours,
J. L. BEARD.
Tha County, Says Senator Franck, Is Too Conservative to Bite at Sugar-
Coated Free-Silver Plums.
SANTA CiiARA, Sept. 6, 1896.
Charles JC Shortridge, Editor Callâ En: The population of Santa Clara County, in
point of intelligence, ranks very high and
the people form their own conclusions. I
The depression which succeeded the in- I
auguration of the Democratic policy four I
years ago has been to them an object- I
lesson, which has fixed for all time in I
their minds tbe fallacies of free trade. I
They well know that even if free silver I
accomplished all that its adherents I
claimed for it the hardships which have I
been brought uron the people by repeal I
of protective tariff could not be removed. I
Tbe people of Santa Clara County are too I
conservative to bite at delusive and sugar- I
coated free-silver plums, alleged to con- I
tain panaceas for all ills. They know I
their malady, and they know their only I
remedy is protection to their products. It I
is true there are some Republicans in this I
district who favor both free silver and pro- I
tection, but with them protection is para- I
mount and they stand loyally to the party. I
Republicans as a class are not derua- I
pogues or street orators, and are not as I
much heard on tbe street as their Populist H
gnd Democratic opponents; but the real
strength of the parties in thie district is demonstrated by the attendance at the
political meetings. There has not been a Republican club meeting or rally held in
this district which has not drawn large crowds.
On the other hand the Democratic-Populistic meetings have been poorly attended,
Â»nd in Sun Jose last Saturday evening the Democrats were unable to hold a meeting
on account of the absence of all but a mere handful of voters.
The unemployed men, who prior to Cleveland's election and the inanguration of a
free-trade tariff policy (which the Democrats now adhere to, even while they denounce
Cleveland) had plenty of work at good wages, have an abundance of time to listen to
street silver orators, but they as a rule express their satisfaction with tne money now
in use if they could only be given a chance to make it as they did prior to the change
in the tariff policy. They then go to the Republican meetings and cheer for protec
tion and William McKinley. There Is no doubt in my mind that this county will
give an increased Republican majority in November. F. C. FRANCK,

"We are coming. Father Abraham,
three hundred thousand more' was tbe
song sung during tbe dark days of the
Republic by the loyal citizens of tbe coun
try.
That song is being repeated now in this
new dark era, while the spider spins his
web on tbe spokes of commerce and while
labor sits idle and hungry, dozing in the
sun, to wake perhaps in desperation when
the winter's gale cuts him to the marrow.
It is being sung by the loyal-hearted, ir
respective of party politics, and they are
even elected a constable in the United States, but have succeeded in many instances
in drawing enough votes away from the Republican party to elect the Democratic can
didate, have now gone into the Bryan and Sewall or Bryan and Watson camp, pro
claiming in a loud voice that they have left the Republican party. The larger propor
tion of the Prohibitionists in this place have openiy declared for McKinley and are
earnestly working for his election. A few men who have heretofore been Republicans
riave declared for Bryan, but it is the judgment of our best posted men that for every
Repnblican who has left the party the Republicans have gained four Democratic
voters instead, and that the same result is true of the Prohibition party, that McKin
ley will get four of them to every one for Bryan.
Pasadena's registration shows about 2300 voters, and it is estimated that of that
number McKinley will get 1700. Bryan 500 and the remainder scattering or not voting.
We have a splendid McKinley club here, also a uniformed marchinc club, and ail are
enthusiastic in their support of that grand soldier statesman. If other portions of
this magnificent State will do their duty as Southern California, sound money, pro
tection, reciprocity and prosperity will surely be the result of the election by placing
McKinley in the Presidential chair next March. Yours truly, C. M. SIMPSON.
"Many Democrats Think the Present Silver Sentiment Is a Delusion."
Says Senator R. Llnder.
Tt'LARK, Cat.., August 28, 1806.
â  i bave your letter of the 25th inst., asking
â  for a forecast from me of the result of the
â struggle between the parties in the ap
â  proaching election.
The situation here is about as follows:
â The Republican party will poll a much
â  larger vote for Presidential electors this
â  year than in 1892. A large number of
â  Democrats arc going to vote with the
â  Republican* because they think that the
â  present silver sentiment is a delusion, put
â  forward lor political purposes, and for in*
â dividual personal cain by a few at the
â expense of the masses.
I Thera is a growing sentiment that the
â new doctrines of Brvanism have been pro
â  mulgated merely with the intention of de
â  luding the heedless by means of "catch
â  words." No worker expects to receive
â  money for which he does not work, and
â  yet unprincipled demagogues are striving
â to persuade the people that by discour
â  aging manufacturers they can increase
â  their own incomes. Such a dishonest at*
â  tempt can hardly succeed.
If free and unlimited coinage of silver
should by accident prevail, I should con
â¢ider it the greatest calamity that has ever befallen this country, and one that would
give our industries auch a setback that would require a generation to restore it.
I trust, however, in the good sense of our people to carry us through this coming
election, and that no such calamity mentioned will curse the country. Yours
â¼cry truly, R. UNDER.
POMONA, Cal., Aug. 31, 1896.pi
Charles M. Shortridge, Editor Callâ Sib: The prospects for Republican success im-|
prove every day. While the sentiment^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
in this county is undoubtedly strong forH
silver, still the majority of the people be- 1
lieve that protection is a more vital issue. I
As yon know, Pomona is only a few ruilesH
from the sugar factory at Chino. MuchH
of the money received there for beets andH
labor is spent in the Pomona stores, anal
our merchants to a man are in favor ofH
advancing the sugar interests, either by aH
bounty or protection. They understandH
that Bryan is an enemy to sugar, andH
therefore they are going to vote againstH
him. We have a flourishing campaignH
club, which holds enthusiastic meetingsH
every Saturday. We are getting new mem-H
hers continually. On the 23th inst. theH
first rally of the McKinley club was heldH
in this city. It was the largest poliucalH
event ever held in this valley. 1). Â£. Mc-H
Kinlay of Santa Rosa was the speaker ofH
the evening, and he held the vast audi-H
cnce for over two hours, and, strange toH
say, not a man, woman or child left thel
large tent during the speaking. ThereH
were at least 2000 present, and the great-
est enthusiasm prevailed. Eon. J. E. Packard, the president of the club, presided.
When the chairman called this vast meeting to order not a vacant seat was to be had
and many stood up on the outside of the tent. In my judgment we should circulate
all the literature we can. The people are reading and thinking this year. The litera
ture should be local in character. A pamphlet on the benefits of encouraging sugar
will make more votes than a dozen on abstract propositions. Ido not believe in
abusing the other parties, because we are getting lots of recruits from them and we
can "catch more flies with molasses than with vinegar." We have a hard fight, but
we are going to win. Yours truly, . S.^^^^^^^^^^H

â the Remiblican vote. Had the election
â taken place immediately after the Chicago

â judgment, the county is for McKinley,
â  and on the 3d of November his majority
â >" the county will depend on the amount
â of work done by the party. The causes
â of this change are: Firstâ The growth of
â the sound-money sentiment and the in
â  tellipent study the people of the county,
â  irrespective of party, are giviug to the
â money question. Secondâ The people of
â  San Diego County are a law-abiding peo
â  ple and are thoroughly loyal to the Gov
â ernment under which they live and to the
â constitution and laws framed for the or
â  dering of that Government; they cannot
â  and will not support a party which deÂ»
â  nounces an administration put in power

â theynor -will they support a party that
Mthreatens to pack the Supreme Court, the
arbiter of tnis Jan. i, for declaring a
law unconstitutional which their own candidate characterizes as unjust. Thirdâ The
people of Ban Diego County are vitally interested in the question of protection. We
have a brilliant future in the cultivation of the lemon and other fruits, and the Wil
â on-Gorman bill was a blow at this industry. Our wool interests, while not so large
as in some other parts of the State, are considerable, and the wool-growers who voted
for Cleveland in 1892 will vote solidly for McKinley. The singular feature in this
county is that the work has been done, not by political committees or by tne ordinary
methods, but by the spontaneous effort of individual voters all over the county who
have organized sound-money clubs and clubs for political discussion and disseminated
literature. In the city Assembly district Mr. Guy, the present Assemblyman, will be
renominated and re-elected in spite of an apparent fusion majority of nearly 600. In
the country district no candidate on the Republican side has been settled upon, but
several good candidates are in the field and a man will be selected to overcome the
fusion majority in this district.

party which Father Abraham endeared to

licans alike.
Democrats who have for years adhered
to the heresy of free trade, or tariff for
revenue only, have become convinced that
the principle is rignt only when applied
to products which cannot be grown or
manufactured in the home country. They
have become convinced that the free ad
mission of competing eoods from a coun
try where wages are $1 a day into a coun
try where wages are $2 a day can have
only one result, and that is the conversion
of the $2-a-day country into a fl-a-day
country.
Hence they are joining the army of pro
gress and Republicanism and are demand
ing home rule for the products of the
United States. They have become weary
of the spectacle of closed factories in this
country a;.d busy factories in Great
Britain and elsewhere pouring into this
country a stream of pauper labor products,
driving American manufacturers out of
business by the keenness of the competi
tion and throwing American laborers and

"I have been a Democrat all my life,"
he said to a Call reporter yesterday, "but
the conditions have changed and being a
sensible man I haye changed with them.
One policy under one condition would be
very bad under another condition. I have
become from bitter experience a believer
in the doctrine of protection.
"I am also opposed to having two values
of money in the country. We must have
one kind of money or the other, and if
we fall back on the silver basis it will drive
the gold away. The very fear of the un
settled condition of finances has induced
people to take their gold out or the sav
ings bank and to deposit it in the safe de
posits. That has made money very
scarce. It has been taken out of interest-
I paying investments through fear of the
I unsettlement of values, and that has
thrown considerable labor out of employ
ment.
"My main reason for changing is be
cause I believe tnat we must be protected

Mr. Cantrell used to employ 150 men in

The Buckleyites held another big and
enthusiastic session of their municipal
convention at B'nai B'rith Hall last even
ing and did some more wortc on their
ticket.
Godfrey Fisher was nominated for Tax
Collector; Joseph Fassler, dairyman, was
named for Public Administrator: Henry
Doescher, proprietor of the Seal Rock
House, for Treasurer, and Dr. Thomas P.
Bodkin /or Coroner.
The bail was crowded upstairs and
down and out through the entrance to
the bar.
"This is like old times, hey?" said the
lambs, joyfully, and they asked, "Are the
peop.'s with Buck or not, do you think,
now?"
It was a Democratic municipal conven
tion of the "real old-fashioned under-dog
Democracy." as Reel Terry calls it, by
the life of every aisle and file of chairs,
by tbe smoke that befogged the motley
Crowd above the gallery rail and by the
reokleÂ«s restlessness of half the mass.
Colonel A. A. Andrews, immaculate and '
prim, sat in a front seat and smoked a
corncob pipe. T. Carl Spelling was there
in the plug hat that he wears since he
wrote the political love story, "Won on a

to get on the bench this trip, shoved his
way chattering through the boys.

those Buckley leaders were hail-fellows as
they steered the programme.
Dr. C. C. O'Donnell floated about ac
tualiy looking for a nomination among
the delegates.
â¢'They don't seem to want the Demo
cratic party to win," said the candidate
for Coroner. "If they want to win they
want to put men of strength on their
ticKet. But I've got 7000 names on my
petition, thoush I don't need only 1800,
and I'll have 20,000 when 1 get to making
speeches."
They put big flags and a picture of
Bryan up on the stage last night and the
thrill of the political chase seemed to fill
the boys all around.
Three ladies sat in the gallery over the
clock. It was the first time that the
ladies ever graced a Buckley convention
with their refining presence. Their ap
pearance was supposed to be due to the
indorsement of woman suffrage the other
night. 'â â - â ';â â .â¢*. v
They were matronly looking people
and there were two American citizens
down below in whose humble political
fortunes they are intensely interested.
Chairman Nealon didn't propose to let
another brawl disgrace Mr. Buckley's con
vention and by constant hammering and
shouting and calling on the sergeants-at
arms he managed to keep the â¢ restless
crowd in fair subjection.
At 9 o'clock Chairman Malone started
the proceedings, which opened with dis
pensing, as usual, with the rollcall and
minutes.
James H. O'Brien, chairman of the com
mittee on permanent organization and
order of business, submitted a report
on Legislative nominations which was
intended to make the proceedings on Legis
lative nominations conform to the 7aw
which requires nominations to be made
by conventions, the nominations for Sen
ate and Assembly having been made at
primaries. The recommendation was as
follows:
That delegates from the respective Senate- ]
tonal and Assembly districts meet and choose
a chairman and secretary and thereupon pro
ceed to select candidates and nominees for
Senators and Assemblymen and report such
selection when made to the municipal conven
tion for confirmation and ratilication under
subdivision 5 of the order of busi
ness heretofore adopted, and that i
each Senatorial and Assembly dis
trict convention when performing the
duties herein required by resolution regularly
adopted, authorize their respective chairmen
to appoint an auditing committee of five per
sons, citizens and electors of this State, whose
duty it shall be, pursuant to the provisions of
the purity of election law of this State, to re
ceive, expend, audit and disburse air moneys
and generally act under the provisions of said
law.
Thomas F. Egan, who won the nomina
tion in the Seventeenth Senatorial Dis
trict by six votes in a race at hallot-box
stuffing between The Twenty-eighth and
Twenty-ninth districts, came to the plat
form and opposed the report. He was
afraid that the district conventions pro
vided for might ignore the results of the
primary election and name new candi
dates, hie moved to amend the report
so tnat nominations already declared
would be ratified.
Lawrence Buckley, who was defeated
for the nomination by six votes, and who
has a contest pending, got up on the statre
and expressed his sorrow that the primary
in his district was not conducted fairly.
"Anybody who knows anything about
practical politics knows that it couldn'ibe
fair. Th-re vrere 978 ballots cast in one
hour and a Quarter, and how could that be
done?" sai 1 Mr. Buckley.
There was a loud "ha! ha!" at this
funny story, and amid much shouting
the chairman declared the amendment
and then the report adopted.
The following committee to recommend
nominees for School Directors to the cen
vention was announced by districts:

The rollcall on the nomination for Tax
Collector was a long process, the mon
otony of which was constantly relieved by
Neaion's persistent eavel whacks and
shouts for order, occasional cries of "put
him out" and little flashes of humor from
the freemen who voted. One delegate
voted for "Behrend Yoost"; they laughed
when John L. Sullivan voted, and when
another delegate shouted resolutely, "I
vote for the man who gives the widows
and orphans a chance," tnere were all
kinds of racket.
The announcement of the vote was as
follows: Votes cast, 372; necex<Â»arv to a
choice, 22G; Mills, 85; Joost, 109; Fisher,
179.
The nice appearance of a contest having
been made, the programme on Fisher was
quickly carried out. Heggerty withdrew
Mills, C. W. Pope announced Joost's
withdrawal, and Fisher was nominated by
acclamation.
When Dr. James I. Stanton mounted
the platform to name the candidate for
Treasurer he got the greatest ovation of
the convention. He nominated Henry
Doescher, who he said was well known in
business circles and popular with a num
ber of societies.
Doescher was at once declared the
nominee and Chairman Nealon called Dr.
W. D. McCarthy to the chair while he
nominated Dr. Thomas P. Bodkin for
Coroner.
"None of us knew the hour when the
services of a coroner may be needed," ob
served Mr. Nealou as he described his
candidate as a young native son, cultured
and above reproach.
By the applause the boys knew Dr.
Bodkin.
"I move that Dr. Bodkin be elected
unanimously," shouted a delegate, and
the motion was carried.
For Public Administrator Dr. E. 8. Mc-
Carthy named Jo3eph Fassler, "a man
whom the newspapers dare not touch,"
and Mr. Fassler is the nominee.
Mr. Kelly of the Twenty-eighth District
secured recognition, and said: "Mr. Chair
man, I've been around this town a great
deal." The convention instantly decided
to hear what Mr. Kelly had seen around
this town, and amid much hilarity they
roared "Platform! Platform !" and would
not be refused. Mr. Kelly was forced to
the platform, where the chairman grace
fully shelved Mr. Kelly on a chair "for
just a minute."
The cbair asked for names as nominees
for School Director to be referred to the
committee, and a flood of them came with
disorder.
There were submitted the names of
Joseph P. Kennedy, Dr. Bush, Thomas R.
Carew, Dr. C. A. Clinton, W. C. Reed, J.
J. Kilday, C. J. Heggerty, Dr. H. Cahili,
T. W. Flannagan, E. B. Farnsworth, H.
B. Morey. Thomas H. Mann, John J.
Rnfferty and John J. McCarthy.
It was decided that fun her names should
be handed in writing to the secretary, and
the flood continued after the adjournment
until to-night, which followed.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1896.
SUFFRAGISTS OPEN
THEIR CAMPAIGN
Magnificent Demonstration
at Metropolitan
Temple.
SPEECHES BY ORATORS.
Various Political Parties Send
Delegates to the Mass-
Meeting.
MRS. CHAPMAN CATT SPEAKS.
Addresses by Miss J De Roulston, J
M. L?g<?ett, C. W. Reed and
Other Delegates.
Amid a mighty outburst of popular en
thusiasm, the like of which has seldom if
ever been seen al any political meeting
held in this City, the woman suffragists
opened their campaign last night with a
magnificent demonstration in Metropoli
tan Temple.
The interior of the large auditorium was
elaborately decorated. Long streamers of
red, white and blue hung from the central
lanterns to the walls, transforming the
usually bare interior into an immense
pavilion of harmonious color-contrasts.
The galleries were festooned with hang
ings of bunting and the stage embowered
in feathery palms, while the gilded pipes
of the great organ were almost concealed
by a network of floral garlands, pennants,
gonfalons and gracefully draped flags.
Professor Eckmann gave a classic organ
recital as the people were gathering, com
mencing with Handel's "Largo" and
ending with Herold'a brilliant over
ture to the opera ol '"Zampa." The
temple was soon filled to overflowing. The
following corps of ushers did good work
in seating the earlier arrivals:
Misses Burnett, Smith, Miller, Schling
heyde, Belle and Mary Gorham, Mar
guerite and Winifred Warner, Jackson,
Holbrook. Hill, Carter, Whelan, Cole,
Pounney, Gove ana Kidd; Mrs. Palmer,
and Messrs. Robbins and Lyons. Mrs.
Emma B. Sweet was mistress of cere
monies, and saw to it that no hitch marred
the affair.
On the stage were seated the following
named vice-presidents:
Miss Mary v. Hay, William Bunker, Charles
Riddeii, Miss Affnel M. Manning, Mr. and Mrs.
S. L. Lent, AluxÃnaer liadlam, C. W. Reed, M.
M. Estee, ChnrlÂ»sW. Manwaring, E. M. War

ham, Henry C. Dibble, Oliver Everett, Mrs.
George E. Spencer, Mrs. J. Murray Bailey,
Theodore Reichart, Major C. W. Kyle, I. J.
Truman, Judge Spencer, Mr. and airs. Paris

Also the following named members of
the State Suffrege Association and joint
campaign committee:
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, Miss Harriett Cooper,
Mrs. Ada Â£. Van Pelt, Mrs. Ida A. Harper, Mrs
Mary S. Sperry, MrÂ«. Mary A. Swift, Mrs. Hester
HHrlaiid, Mrs. (ieorge Oulton, Mrs. Isabell A.
Baldwin, Mme. Sorbier, Mrs. Knoz Gooilrich
and Mrs. Kate Tupper Galpin, and the follow
ing namea participants in the programme:
Mrs. A. A. Surg.nt. Miss Susan B. Anthony,
Rev. Anna H. Shaw, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt
Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Blinn, Fred Head, Miss
Jane Roulaton, Joseph Leggett, Douglass
Fowler and Charles Wesley Reed.
Mrs. Sargent onened the meeting with a
cordial and well-worded address of wel
come, congratulating the audience upon
the orators whom they were to hear.
"We have," she said, "some of the most
eloquent speakers of California and a
galaxy of Eastern stars as welL But best
of all we have with us to-night the
National President Â©f the United States
Suffrage Association, who will preside
over to-night's meeting. Gentlemen and
lalies, I have no need to introduce to you
Miss Susan B. Anthony."
Cheer upon cheer greeted the veteran
suffragist ieader as she rose to take the
gavel.
The Knickerbocker male quartet â com
posed of D. M. Lawrence, first tenor; C.
M. Elliott. second tenor; D. B.
Crane, first bars, and L. A. Larsen,
second bassâ then sang "Giving the
Ballot to the Mothers," the suffrage song
being set to the tune of "Marching
i Throueh Georgia," and "The Daughters
I of Coiumbio," sung to the well-known
notes of "Hold the Fort," the immense
audience joining lustily in the chorus.
Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Blinn made a
charming address of welcome to the
Eastern workers for the cause of woman
suffrage. In glowing words she depicted
the labors and sacrifices of Miss Anthony,
and paid a graceful and well- merited
tribute to the valuable services of Mrs.
Sweet, Miss Hay, Miss Shaw and the other
ladies who have aided the movement so
materially by their presence and co
operation.
Miss Jane Roulston, the Socialist dele
gate, spoke as follows:
When the new economic thought of the cen
tury first began to converge toward a central
point it found expression through a little band
of strong thinkers, now known as the Social
Democrat* of tho world. It did not for one
moment occur 10 these great men that In their
plan for the a<ivanrement ot the human race
theirjmothers, their wives and their daughters
could be left outside.
Let us look for a moment at the long and
glorious life of tho leader of this movementâ
a life of stern devotion. Devotion to what ?
l'o pleading, enueaiing, pruying, protestiii<
and demanding a few petty privileges for
women which no law of common-sense or
common decency could ever have denied her;
using ail the force and logic of a cU-ar, strong
intellect in refuting arguments so simple and
ridiculous that the children of the future will
laugh them to scorn; and even now I hear
they are still flinging their sickly sentimen
tality and brutally selfish arguments in her
patient face.
For meâ l am not patient! and when I con
sider these things a great wrath rises in me
which amounts almost to tne frenzy of despair!
But I fancy, dear friends, that what you
really want of me to-niglu is some expression
of the stand of the S. L. P. of California re
garding what is known as the sixth amend
ment. Our position here is unusual and needs
some explanation. Now even the most frivo
lous mind cannot but feel that we are on the
verge of a great economic crisis.
We take no stand upon the so-called great
money issue that Is agitating the Nation to
day, but there are men in our ranks, working
men, rough clad nnd unbeautiful, who can see
through and beyoud both sides of the ques
tion with a clearness of vision which might
well make political confusionists tremble and
the throne of plutocracy shake from its very
foundation.
But of this sixth amendment we mase a
notable exception. In the great uprising of
t ie women of the world we Â».ee, not a mere
s.iie issue of the times, but a part, and no
a.uall part, of the mighty struggle of an
o;. pressed humanity, Prometheus striving to
arise. In this loud woman's call, resounding
through the length and breadtn of the land,
we recognize one note in the great world cry.
and when it calls our name we answer,
"Here!"
Mr. Leggett, representing the single-tax
advocates, said he thought all of his com
rades would vote for the sixth amend
ment.
"We will vote thus," he proceeded, "be
cause we are logical. Holding as we do
that all have a right to see* their common
and private good, we cannot withhold
from woman the chief means to that end.
"We men are not in a position to con
cede the right of suffrage to woman; the
right is hers as much as it is ours. But
we can vote to do away with the unjust
laws which hinder herin the enjoyment
of that God-givÂ»n right."
Mr. Leggett went on to mention a few of
the advantages which in his conception
would accrue to the commonwealth were
women admitted to the right of suffrage.
His remarks told most powerfuliy, and
were frequently interrupted by bursts of
applause.
Mr. Fowler, the Populist delegate, said
he felt proud to have a chance to say a
word for woman suffrage. He gave a brief
historical sketch of the adoption of a
woman suffrage plank in the Populist
platform at the great convention in
Hazard's Pavilion in Los Angeles in Oc
tober, 1891.
"That plank has been confirmed from
year to year," proceeded Mr. Fowler.
"Ladies of the Suffrage Bureau, you are
eloquent, logical speakers, and we love to
hear you; but so far as the Populists are
concerned your convincing arguments and
glowing words are unnecessary. Woman
suffrage is a doctrine of the Populist
party, and on the 3d of next November
every Populist vote will count on the side
of justice to woman."
Charles Wesley Reed, the Democratic
representative, was next introduced by
Miss Anthony in a sparkling little speech
as "our Democratic chamnion." He said
he had been a woman suffragist long be
fore there was any agitation in this State
in relation to the movement. The Demo
cratic party of the State was, he said, in
process of conversion.
"The Buckley ring at B'nai B'rith Hall
the other night," he went on, "put a
woman suffrage plank in its platform. 1
wonder what influence was brought to
bear upon Mr. Buckley. I heard it said
that Miss Anthony had a dinner with
him."
"I had an interview with him," admit
ted Miss Anthony amid a general laugh
"and he told me he had been a woman
suffragist ever since he could remember."
Mrs. Chapman-Catt was next intro
duced, and her welcome was loud and
long.
"Reason and experience,' she began
"are the two tesis by which I ask you,
men of California, to" judge the woman
suifrage movement. The practical results
of woman suffrage are to be seen in sev
eral States and nations, but notably in
Wyoming, where it has had over twenty
years in which to show what it can do.
"The ideal State is that in which there
is the least percentage of illiteracy, pov
erty, criminality, insanity and idiocy.
Let us see whether Wyoming comes any
where near this ideal."
Mrs. Chapman-Catt then drew allowing
word-picture of the State of Wyoming.
"Schools flourish everywhere, the
people are prosperous, the jails are nearly
empty, the insane asylums thinly popu
lated with a forlorn contingent of men
only, while in the whole State there is
only one idiot, and he was a grown man
when he arrived there."
Her peroration was a most brilliant
triumph of oratory, and a moving plea for
a higher ana purer civilization.
A collection was taken up by a number
of the lady ushers, during which Professor
Eckman gave a magnificent rendering of
the march from Tannhauser on the or
gan.
Miss Hay, amtd mnch cheering, an
nounced that Miss Anthony would speak
this evening at Odd Fellows' Hall, at the
entertainment to be given by the Native
Sons of Vermont.
Miss Anna Shaw spoKe at length ur>on
the woman-suffrage movement. With
keen satire and sparkling wit, she called
attention to the arguments usually alleged
against the giving of the ballot to women,
and forthwith proceeded to demolish
those arguments in a manner as unique
as it was sweeping.
As i each well-worn sophism fell before
the batteries of the gifted lady's clear-cut,
flawless logic cheers rent the air and hand
kerchiefs and hats were waved with over
mastering enthusiasm.
A few words from Miss Anthony made
every man present feel like voting for
amendment 6, and the great assembly
dissolved with three cheers for political
equality.
In the Thirty-Sixth.
A large mass-meeting was held by Club
No. 2, Thirty - sixth Assembly District,
last evening in honor of Congressman
Loud. S. J. Duckworth was the leading
speaker, discussing the money question.
Judge E. D. Sawyer talked on tbe tariff;
Robert Ash and A. P. Van Duzer and
Andrew Branch also spoke, and Congress
man Loud closed the meeting with a short
speech. He was enthusiastically received.

Dark-eyed signorinas and handsome,
black-mustacbed signors to the number of

"Italian night," and a brilliant success did
Italy's sons and daughters make of it. The
band was in perfect harmony with the
event, rendering only airs composed by
Italian masters. For nearly three bours
the festivities continued, and when finally
the hour for adjournment came everybody
appeared willing to vote "Italian night"

Chairman Ruckstell named as a commit
tee on resolutions Drs. Daywalt, Tuley
and Adams, believing that these three
medical gentlemen would prescribe intel
ligently for the good of the cause and con
vention.
J. H. Tingman, J. A. Gove and J. H.
Johnson were appointed a committee on
credentials.
On motion it was ordered that an inves- i
tigating committee be appointed to pass j
upon the general fitness of the legislative
candidates to be chosen. After some diffi
culty, as many appeared indisposed to act
in so delicate a capacity, J. H. Tingman,
J. M. Custer, W. E. Walter, Dr. George ;
Adams and J. D. Spencer were selected.
Tingman moved that the secretary
officially notify the leaders and members
of the Democratic and Silver parties in
this City that the Populist legislative con
vention is now in session. The motion i
was carried unanimously. It was also
moved that a conference committee be
appointed to confer with the Democratic
and silver people on affairs political. The
motion prevailed, but the matter was laid '
over till the next meeting.
J. A. Johnson offered a resolution to the
effect that in the last campaign a commit- I
mittee from the People's party recom
mended that the Clifford voting-machine
be used at all elections; and as a constitu
tional amendment is to be voted upon at
the coining election, legalizing a voting
machine in the State, therefore be it
Retolved, That the People's party pledge all
it.s candidates for the Legislature to support a
bill legalizing the Clifford voting machine, or
some one better, in place of our present elec
tion system throughout ihe State of California.
The matter was referred to the commit
tee on resolutions and the convention ad
journed till next Thursday evening, when
a full delegation will be present and the
legislative ticket chosen.

Danger to
Young Men.
I UUis^ IbSulli
The chances of total loss of manly power
are so great in men who find slight indi-
cations of a waste in the system that it is
vitally important that such indications be
attended to at ance. They should be
j checked while such a. thing is possible, for
; if they are permitted to continue, instead
â  of stopping naturally, they will Decome
i greater from day to day, and will, in a few
! years, completely disrupt the whole nerv-
I ous and vital organism.
j Young men who notice what they con-
i aider light symptoms of weakness do not
i realize the danger that lurks in their path.
They do not understand the serious conse-
quences, the destruction of nerve tissue,
j waste of vital force and power of brain,
I loss of flesh, loss of memory and total
lim potency. These are 'he consequences
that follow in the trail of slight evidences
of weakness.
CURE IT NOW.
To protect your future manhood, to
guard against total loss of vitality, regain
your health now. While youth is at band
! to bring happiness and joy, such as comes
| to the strong, drive away the cause of de-
pression, bring back confidence, bright
1 eyes and happy disposition. Bring them
back naturally by removing the weakness,

Dr. A. T. Sandenâ Dear Sir: It is over a month
since I commenced to wear your Bait, and it has
I made a great change in my condition. I have
! gained eleven pounds in twenty-eight days.
â  When I started to wear your belt I was so run
I down that I had to give up work. The belt
stopped the weakness in four days, and I
have had none since. I took up my duty at the
engine after wearing the belt a week and have
â  not lost an hour since. My father has been
i wearing the belt from three to four hours a
I day, and is now able to put his hands above
I his head, something he has not been able to do
1 for forty-five years, and he never tires of tell-
ing the people of the good the belt has done
for him. As for me, I would DOC take all tho
! gold in the country for my belt and no back to
: the condition I was in two months ago, if I
could not get another one like it. I cannot
[ speak too highly of your belt and tho good-it
has done me. 1 remain yours gratefully. â  r

INCENDIARISM
Investigation Into the Cause
of a Fire on Post
Street.
SUSPICIOUS DISCOVERY.
Valuable Silverware and Money
Stolen From a Trunk in
the House,
THE EEAE DOOR FORCED OPEN.
It Is Believed the Place Was Set oa
Fire by the Thief to Cover
Up His Crime.
What has every appearance oi being a
robbery, followed by an attempt to burn
down the building to cover the crime, is
being investigated by Fire Marshal
Towe.
Wednesday evenine about 8 o'clock a
fire broke out in the flat at 920 Post Btreet
occupied by Mrs. Elizabeth Niles, an old
lady, the widow of a policeman. The
fiames were extinguished before much
damage was done, and after the smoke
cleared away there was unmistakable
evidence of incendiarism.
The house is a two-story one, and Mrs.
Niles occupies the top flat. The occupant
of the lower flat was the first -to discover
the fire, and thinking that Mrs. Niles was
perhaps in bed he ran upstairs in the rear.
The door was open, and after making a
hurried search of the rooms he did not
find any trace of the old Jady.
Mrs. Nilea was seen by the Fire Marshal
yesteraay. Bnesaid: "I left the house
about 7 o'clock to make a call, and locked
both tbe front and rear rooms. I did not
return tm about 9 o'clock, and was sur
prised and alarmed to find that the house
nad Deen on nre. lam positive I locked
the rear door, and there was nothing com
bustible in the house."
In making his examination the Fire
Marsnai asked to examine her trunk. She
gave him the key, and, after trying to
open it, be found it was unlocked. Mrs.
Niles told him she had locked it the
previous night before the fire, and was
alarmed at it being unlocked. When tbe
trunk was opened she immediately said
that her silverware, which was packed in
it, had been stolen. Sbe said sbe also
had $80 in coin in the trunk, but it was
not found, and the probability is it had
been stolen also.
The fire had been confined entirely to
the dining-room, but in one of the front
bedrooms the Fire Marshal found a small
wicker basket filled with excelsior satu
rated with kerosene.
"I tbinit," said the Fire Marshal last
night, "that Mrs. Niles is telling the truth,
and it strikes me that whoever stole her
siJverware and money put the wicker bas
ket fn tiie bedroom to eive the impression
it was a case of incendiarism on the part
of the occupant so as to remove suspicion
of robbery if the trunk and its contents
had been destroyed.
"Another peculiar thing is that the rear
door was found unlockoa and the brass
covering at the lock had been forced off.
This leads me to the belief that the thief
had tried to open the door with a key, but
finding tbe brass was in the way be forced
it off, which enabled him to insert the key
in tbe lock.
"Mrs. Niles is a respectable old lady.
Sho was to have removed to another
house to-day and part of her furniture
had been taken there. She is insured for
$1000, which I think is far too much, but I
blame the brokers more than her, as they
force people to overinsure their property.
"I have not yet finished my investiga
tion, but I am inclined to believe that
robbery was committed and the place was
set on fire to cover up the crime."
The case has been reported to the police.
THE LEPERS ARE BETTER
Remarkable Effect of the Goto
Remedy on Pesthouse
Inmates. v
Ravages of the Disease Arrested and
Patients Happyâ A New Supply
Wanted.
The unfortunate lepers at the Pesthouse
were never so happy since they first en
tered the forbidding institution on Twen
ty-sixth street as at present. According
to their own statements and the observa
tion of the superintending physician there
seems to be good reason for the lepers' re
joicing. For the sufferers claim that the
Goto cure â the unknown quantity in med
icine brought over from Japan â has at
least arrested the ravages of their dread
ful disease, put an end to the pain and
burning sensations and healed their
bodies. The physician corroborates most
of these assertions, more particularly the
one of healing, because he has noted the
change for the better and can speak his
convictions based on observation. From
this it may be inferred that the remedy of
"Dr." Goto of Japan has a beneficial effect
on leprosy.
"The patients are taking the cure con
stantly," said the doctor yesterday, "and
they are apparently comfortable and
cheerful, but beyond healing ti.e ulcers I
see no change in their condition. They
claim that their general condition has im
proved, but the cure now seems to be at a
standstill. Their appetites are good and
the pain and burning sensation in those
who suffered has neurly totally disap
peared. Only the deformity remains.
"The supply of the remedy has pretty
nearly given out, and it would be a good
thing for The Call, or somebody, to start
a subscription with which to buy another
supply.' 1
"Why not the City?"
"Can't. In the first place the appropria
tion was made oefore we bad a chance to
find out if the cure had any good in it.
No provision was made in the appropria
tion for the purchase of the drug, which
was then regarded as an experiment. For
several reasons I think it a good thing to
continue it. For instance, it improves
the condition and has a eood effect on the
minds of the lepers. The remedy will last
about two months longerâ just long
enough to get a fresh supply if ordered at
once."
Stole Gold lÂ»uv.
For several days Detective Bohen and Police
men Campbell and Douglass have been match
ing the General Postoffice for Jack Dangerfield,
a man wanted In Auburn, Placer County, for
stealing $40 in gold dvg 1 . He was arrested
yesterday afternoon when he called for letters
and was taken to the City Prison, to await toe
arrival of the Sheriff oX Placer County.
All Classes of Vessels Were Off the Golden Gate Yesterday. There Were Schooners, Barkentines, Barks, Ships and Steamers, AU Making for the Entrance, but the
Prettiest Scene of the Day Was When the Archer, Emilia Gampa, Wavertree and Columbia Were AU Making Port at the Same Time. The Archer Secured
a Tug and Won on Time Allowance.
ALL CLASSES OF
VESSELS ARRIVE
Barkentines, Barks and
Ships Made a Gocd
Showing.
IN ON THE FLOOD TIDE.
Off the Heads the Ciampa Led
the Way, but the Others
Held Their Own.
THE ARCHER SECUBED A ITJG.
Nevertheless the Ciampa Beat Her
Ii and the Others Made
Good Time.
Among the arrivals yesterday was a
representative of almost every craft afloat.
The big China liner, City of Peking, got
in early in the morning and late in the
afternoon the schooner Emma Utter ar
rived witfc 360,000 feet of lumber from
Port Blakeley.
At one time there was off the heads the
barkentine Archer, twenty-two days from
Honolulu; the Italian bark Emilie
Ciarapa, 162 days from Antwerp, and the
British ship Wavertree, sixty-nine days
from Newcastle, N. S. W. Jn the distance
was the ship Columbia, beating her way
in from the Sound. Tugboats and coasters
filled up the picture.
The Italian bark Emilie Ciampe came
in under sail. Captain Maresta reports
that off the Horn be had the usual heavy
weather and in the Pacific the calms, re
ported by nearly every vessel that has ar
rived during the past month.
Early in the morning the British ship
Androsa, Captain Morgan, got in. She is
from Caleta Buena and is well known in
San Francisco. Captain Morgan was for
merly chief officer of the ship Somali, the
bizgest sailing vessel that ever visited this
coast. He is disgusted over the long voy
age made by his ship to San Francisco, but
asserts that "only the gods control the
winds."
Of all the vessels that came in together,
the Ciampa reports heavy weather off the
Horn and light winds to San Francisco,
while the Wavertree had light winds ali
the way. The Archer was caught in sev
eral squalls, but thÂ«y were all against l.er,
and in consequence when Captain Cal
houn came to hgure up his time he found
that his vessel was at least a week behind
j lime.
The only disengaeed vessel in port is
the British ship Lauriston. October load
ing has called every craft into requisition,
ami vessels that last month could notcom
rnand anything like decent prices are now
selling at a premium. Captain W. F.
Mills of Herriman & Miils has purchased
a gold, silver and copper mine in Nevada.
The firm wants to send the ore to Swansea
for treatment, and Captain Herriman is
anxious to secure a cheap charter. He has
almost succeeded in 'making a coiitract
with the captain of the Lauriston, and in
the event of its completion the ore will go
to Swansea and another industry will leave
this coast.
The Harbor Commissioners did not meet
yesterday. Commissioner Cols was on a
visit to his ranch in Sierra County and
Commissioner Chadbourne had not re
turned from his Stockton trip. President
Colnon was on hand, but as be was alone
in the business nothing could be done.
Private letters from England state that
Captain Wishart of the Sierra Parima
was exonerated from all blame by a
court of inquiry. The ship went on the
Maldive Islands in a dense fog, and the
court of inquiry held that Captain Wishart
had exercised due diligence, and that the
set of the current was responsible for the
grounding of the ship, and not the
master's seamanship.

He is insane and imagines that he owns

it. Success turned his head.
A number of United States sailors were
brought over in iron*, but as their offense
is desertion the chances are that they will
get off with light sentences.
The Peking cad a rough time of it. She
was in Hongkong when the hurricane de

REVERSED THE COLLECTOR
The General Appraiser Says
Japanese Matting Can
Enter Free.
Ruling in a Lccal Case ot Interest to
Many Importers Upon the
Pacific Coast.
A decision of some importance to local
importers of Japanese floor matting has
just been rendered by General Appraiser
fSomervilie. The opinion reverses a ruling
recently made by Collector Wise and inci
dentally gives a precedent for future im
portations of a similar character. The
facts in the case are fully covered in the
opinion of the General Appraiser, the
substance of which is as follows:
W. J. Sloane & Co. and M. J. Brandenstein <fc
Co. va. Collector at San Francisco.
Opinion by Somervllle, G. A., August 26,
x 890Â«
The merchandise covered by each of the pro
tests consists of floor niattin*, commonly
known as Japanese floor matting, and is prop
erly represented by the accompanying sample
marked exhibit 2. The Collector ><*sessed the
merchandise covered by tirottst 285(37- B under
paragraph 277 of the tariff act o! 1894 at 35
per cent ad valorem as a manufacture of vege
table fiber not specially provided for in said
act; that covered by protest 29686-B was as
sessed for duty at 25 per cent ad valorem
under paragraph 352 ot said act as a manu
facture of straw not specially provided for in
said act.
It is insisted in the protests that the articles
in question are subject to classification either
under said paragraph 277 as a manufacture of
straw or tree under paragraph 485, which
reads as follows:
"iloor matting manufactured from round
or split straw, including what is commonly
known as Chinese matting."
We find from the testimony taken at the
hearing that the merchandise consists of
Japanese floor matting usually imported in
leiiÃtns vaiying from one to forty yards and
rcade of round straw. The peculiar texture of
the matting consists of two round straws
which are twisted together. An expert wit
ness who testified at the hearing stated that
Chinese matting is almost universally made
ot split straw, wnile Japanese matting is made
of round straw.
We find accordingly that the merchandise 1b
floor matting manufactured of round straw
within the meaning of said paragraph 485 of
the free list and the protests claiming the
goods to be exempt from duty under Â»aid
paragraph are sustained and the Collector's
decision in each case is reversed with instruc
tions to reliquidate the entries accordingly.

CATHOLIC LADIES'
NINTH CONVENTION
They Will Meet Next
Tuesday at the Hotel
Del Mar.
GOOD DEEDS OF A YEAR.
The Aid Society May Feel Proud
of Its Nobl.; and Gen
erous Charity.
DELEGATES TO THE CON VENTIOH
Representatives of Branches Thrcugh
cut California Who Will
Participate.
The Catholic Ladies' Aid Society isabout
to bold its ninth annual convention, and,
as new questions are to be met on ttiis
occasion, considerable speculation is going
on as to what may be the outcome of the
convention.
Members of the society are congratulat
ing themselves over a good year's work,
all in the cause of charity, and the results
so far accomplished have imbued the
charitable ladies with enthusiasm for more
extended endeavor* on behalf of those
needing assistance. Another reason is
given for the self-satisfaction entertained
by the more active members, and it is
thisâ the Hotel del Mar, which is owned
and conducted by the society at beautiful
Santa Maria del Mar on Monterey Bay,
near Santa Cruz, has had a very suc
cessful season. The hotel is maintained
as a Catholic summer resort by the sea
side, with the main object in view of
applying whatever profits that might
accrue to charitable purposes. The con
vention will be held this year at Hotel del
Mar, whither several delegates are already
journeying.
With mass in the hotel next Tuesday
morning the ninth erand council of the
society wiil be opened. It is expected that
the deliberations of the delegates will
carry the session on to Saturday, when
the week will be brought to a close with a
grand ball either at Del Mar or Santa
Cruz.

During the past year the total disburse
ments of the Catholic Ladies' Aid Society
amounted to something more than $9000.
This was distributed among deserving
poor people, to some as fuel, to Others* as
provisions or medicine or new clothing,
and frequently in cash. The money was
received by the society from dues, dona
tions and entertainments.
With repard to membership the society
has maintained its old standard of about
1500 members, inciodine coiitrioutinjr,
honorary and active. Two branches were
established since tne last convention, one
at Lompoc, Sania B.irb-.ira County, and
the other in trail Francisco.
It is proposed to revise ibÂ« constitution
and ritual of the society with a view of
doing relief work more actively even than
before, and altogether in the interest of
the needy. Tlie sociey tuus describes its
worthy aims and objects:
The Catholic Ladies' Aid Society is an organ
ization, whose mission is to aid the poor and
di>tres.-fd, and to cultivnte sociability and
friendship whenever practicable among the
Catholic women Wherever a branch is located.
In the dispensing of charity no distinction as
to creed or nationality is made â tne needs of
suffering humanity being paramount, and
their relief bting the first consideration. But
a stronger plea is to be considered, and in aid
of tins we hope for the co-operation of a gen
erous and ttiscrimitiatini; public, viz. â that no
assist those who call for iielp, to help them
selves, and thus enttbie them to main tain their
self-respect, one of the greatest factors in well
ordered communities.
For the proper disbursement of charity, re
lief committees are c ppolnteii, to serve three
months. Should immediate aid be requir-il,
the committee Investitures the cases with full
power to act; uut should it not nevd immedi
ate assistance, the case is brought before the
society, ana after a thor m^n investigation, a
vote is takeu to decide the matter.
The home and employment committee also
takes a prominent part in our work. It is the
duty of this committee to find homes for
friendless and orphan children in families or
other suitable places, and to secure employ
ment for any in need of it.
The prand officers at the present time
are as follows:
Mrs. Margaret Deane, grand president; Mrs.
J. G. Cooney, tianta Cruz, grand senior vice
president; Mrs. Thomas Keegan, Santa Rosa,
grand junior vice-president; Miss Maria Flynn,
Oakland, grand treasurer; Miss Margaret Cur- i
tis, grand secretary ; Mrs. Mary J. Lohse, Oak- I
land, grand deputy.

THE MORTGAGE TAX
J. I>. Phelan Writes Â» Communication
to the Association of Improve
ment Clubs in Opposition.
The following communication has been
addressed by James D. Phelan, president
of the Association of Improvement Clubs,
to the members of the association in op
position to the adoption of constitutional
amendment 1, which provides for the re
peal of the mortgage tax:
At the last meeting of this association there
was a discussion of constitutional amend
ment 1, apparently providing for the repeal of
the mortgage tax. Yuu were requested to
bring tbe matter to the notice of your several
clubs before the association would take final
action as to its approval or disapproval of the
said amendment
I find on examination that the consti
tutional amendment proposed does not, as a
matter of fact, repeal the mortgage-tax law in
the sense which we regarded it. The amend
ment exempts mortgages from taxation, but it
does not exempt uoies or credits secured by
mortgage, so the object of the repeal is de
feated.
Under the old constitution the courts held
that ft note or credit was not property and
therefore not taxable, but the present con
stitution defines votes or credits to be prop
erty, therefore, if "mortgages" were exempt
from taxation the notes secured by the mort
gages would be taxed and the result would be
that the borrower would pay the full tax on
his property, without deduction, and, in
directly, pay the tax on tbe note, which the
banks would of course figure in the interest
rate. To illustrate: If a man having prop
erty assessed at $10,000 borrows $5000 on a
note and mortgage be is now entitled to a
deduction of SJ>5OOO and pays direct tax upon
$5000 only and indirectly on the $5000 he
borrows; but if "mortgages," as above, were
exempted from taxation ihen he would pay
the eutire direct tax on his property , assessed
at $10,000, and an indirect tax, included in
the interest, on the $5000 he borrows. This
would increase his burden at least one-third.
It would be unjust and accomplish no good
purpose commensurate with the evil done.
I desire to call the attention of the members
to these facts which were not brought out in
the discussion at our last meeting. For this
Tenson I believe the report of our law com
mittee should be adopted and that our asso
ciation should oppose the reveal of the mort
gage tax and consequently resist the adoption
of constitutional amendment No. 1.
Ay to the other points raised in that dis
cussion I desire to say that growing crops,
now exempt from taxation, are not affected
by the amendment. Ii only affects mortgages
and deeds of trust, exempting them from
taxation.
THE DEAD BANDIT
IS IDENTIFIED
E. Sells of the Circus in
Central Park Knew
Him.
SO DID SEVERAL OTHERS
He Was Known as Dec Morgan
and Had a Very Bad
Character.
TRIED TO KiLL A STABLEMAN
Two of His Knowu Corrpanions Do Not
Tally With the Decriptions of the
Oiher Train-Robbsrs.
F. J. Morgan, the train-robber shot by
Engineer Ingles near Sacramento on
September 5, has at last been identified.
On Wednesday night E. Sells, one of the
proprietors of the circus now in Central
Part, saw Detectives Seymour and Whita
ker and he asked them to show him th 6
photo of the dead bandit. Yesterday
morning Captain Lees sent Detective Gib
son with the photo. An soon as he looked
at the photo Le said, "Yes, that's rcy
man." He then asked Gibson to go with
him and see Mr. Chambers, the manager
of the menagerie. Chambers glanced at
the photo and immediately said: "That's
Doc Morgan, who was with us at our win
ter quarters in Columfbus, Ohio, last Feb
ruaiy."
The photo was next shown to one of the
stablemen known as "Pete," and he said:
"That's the man Morgan, who tried to kill
me. Where did you get the photo?" Mr.
feelis showed the photo to several others
and they all identified it as that of "Doc"
Morgan.
Mr. Sells then made the following state
ment:
The latter part of last February I was in my
office in Columbus, Ohio, wheu this man
(.U'jrgan) came iv and asked me for some work
with the circus. Ue said he would like to
work with the circus in order to bury himself
for a couple of years; that he had had some
trouble and it was a matter of dollars and
cents with him. I told him I had no work
around tbe place and would not give him any,
as I did not like his face and did not think he
wanted to hang around the circus for any
good reason. I felt pretty well satisfied he was
no good and notified my men not to have any.
thing to do with him or give him anything to
do. He remained around the circus for sev
eral days and took rooms at the Schrader
House and claimed there that he was con
nected with my circus. I instructed my em
ployes not to employ him in any capacity.
One day he came into the cookhouse and be
gan interfering with the cooks and ordered
them to cook a meal for him. My man, Pete,
came in and ordered him out of the place, and
they had words and Morgan would have killed
Pete if outsiders had not interfered. We are
all positive that this is the same man. He had
a chum who worked in our paintshop at
NEW TO-DAY. >"

Columbus. Ohio, by ilte name of Whitey Bliss,
and another man by the name of Elephant
Slim. All itiese tnrec men w re no good, but
were sirong-:nnied men. Morgan claimed to
be a native- of Kentucky, au i came to Colum
bus, Ohio, from Roanoke. Liberty County
West Virginia. He left with the other two
men about the latter part 01 February, and I
have not seen iiim since.
Morgan, described hs follows: 5 feet 10, age
about 30, 180 pound-, square shouldered,
high cheekbones, blue eyes, broad, square
chin and had a cut on one of his hands, but
wore a glove over it; this cut must have left a
scur; rot Mire whether right or left tiand, in
ciiued to ihink ripht; large-prominent ruse.
Kiissâ Age about 35, weight ltÂ»s, 5 feet 9,
light comph-x on. i.hie eyes, light hair, light
mustache, high cheekboiies. large, prominent
nose, painter by trade, Al card man ana
strong-arm worker, latge scar on right wrist,
claimed to be a native of Virginia.
Elephant Slimâ s feet 4. 140 pounds, Hgo
about 34, black hair and black mustache,
looks line a Spaniard, but is an American.
The description of Bliss and "Elephant
Slim" does not tally with the two men
seen in Morgan's company in the saloon
on East street.

Robert Moffitt, a molder, went into the
notion store of John Manderson, 153
Second street, on Wednesday morning and
hurled a pitcher at him. Manderson
chased him out of the store, but he soon
returned and asked for some nsh hooks.
They had some words and Moffitt threw
two tall bats at Mandeison, one of them
striking and shattering a show case. Then
he threw a box of soap and an ink bottle.
Moffitt then went to, the saloon of J. P.
Miller, 640 Howard street, and they soon
had a fight. Miller had him arrested for
battery, and yesterday morning Mander
son swore out complaints for his arrest for
malicious mischief and assault with a

NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 10.â Speculation
at the Stock Exchange was irregular and rather
feverish. This is only natural in view of yester
day's heavy realizations and the Â« Sorts of the pro
fessional operators to bring about a reaction which
they claim is long overdue. An advance in the
Bank of England rate of discount to 2% percent,
the firs, change since February 22, 1894. a rise in
the 1 rice of eagles in the London market and
sllfTer discounts outside of the bank, coupled witn
lower prices for American securities abroad, all
assisted the reactionary movement. The action
of the bank, it was argued, would check gold ship
ments, but the reverse proved true and the pur
chases of eagles and bars at the Bank of England

CHICAGO. 11.1,. Sepr. 10.â A serious drawback
to activity in to-day's wheat market lay In the an
ticipation of the Government crop report, due in
thÂ«< afternoon. Really very little business was
transacted, both buyers and sellers fee. ing some
what apprehensive and therefore disinclined to
assume an aggressive attitude.
First prices were a trifle under the final ones of
yesterday, some consid' ration being extended
heavy receipts in the Northwest, 1043 cars against
557 last. Thursday ana 8-9 a year ago. Chicago
received 154 cars and inspected -00,959 bushels.
The Cincinnati Price Curr-nt reported no change
in the crop situation and stated that fail plowing
was progressing favorably. Liverpool cables were
i,i<i higher.
Extremely large expert clearance*. 814,854
bushels, stimuli- ted prices for time, but after the
effect wore off even greater weakness than ap
peared early was noted. Buying against puts re
vived the marKet later and the last hour was
marked by compÂ«ra:ive firmness.
Closing Continental cab : were variously higher.
December wheat opened from 583' 8 c to 58Vi<\ sold
between 58%- and 68%@58s / 'Â»c, closing at 68i/8@
08J/icÂ» Vi@ c under yesterday. Estimated re
ceipts for to-morrow .575 cars. Â»
CORNâ Frosts in 1 onions of tbe West and
Northwest, although conceded to be of no probable
importance as a menace to the crop, most of the
corn being out of the way of harm, nevertheless
Imbued traders in this market with courage, caus
ing some buying and a s Ight advancement In
prices. Trade was not brisk, however, and ample
room for Improvement existed. Receipts were
401 cars and 358,901 bushels were taicen from
store. Liverpool cables were quiet and unchanged.
Exports were freÂ« at 524.9H7 bushels. May corn
opened at 23% c, sold between 23Â»4c and 2414 c,
closing at 23%@24c, a shade overyesterday. Esti
mated receip.s for tomorrow. 550 cars.
OATSâ Steadr. Neither the early strength of
corn or the then prevailing weakness of wheat
exerted any particular influence. Business was
limited to small local dealings. Receipts were 136
cars, and 215,030 bushels were taken from store.
Exports were light a 7535 bushels. May oats
closed unchanged from yesterday. Estimated re

PROVISIONSâ InitiaI trading In product was at
steady prices, th" fact that hog prices were with
out change of no.c affording this market no de
cided influence. Later, however, the offerings
asserted force superior to tbe demand, and prices
wavered and men declined. January pork closed

Art of Writing a Telegram.
"Epigrammatic sentences are interest
ing, but there is sucii a thing as being too
strongly epigrammatic," said R. F.Bar
nett of Louisville at the Shoreham. "I was
going into Louisville from Memphis. On
the train was a white-haired old lady,
with whom chance drew me into conver
sation. We became quite friendly, and
she told me she was going to visit
her son, whom she had not seen
for two or three years. He had
written a few week, before, asking
her to visit him at Loui-viile, nam
ing a certain hotel. She arranged her af
fairs as quickly as possible and went. At
the depot she was ereatly disappointed
not to meet her son, and I accompanied
her to the hotel, it beincr the one I wa- in
the habit of patronizing. I took her
to the parlor and volunteered to
find her son. The clerk had not
seen him, but gave me a let
ter for the lady. As soon as she read trie
fisst line she tainted, and I hurriedly sent
lor â  physician, pickin up iha letter. The
first paragraph was: "My Dear Mother: I
am now in the penitentiary," I was
shocked, but read further. The next para
prat'li said : "I have a good position wi; h
the contractors and it is impossible to get
away. Come on to Frankfort. I liave
already rented a house for us to live in."
It tooic us three hour." to bring the mother
to consciousness. â Washington Star.

VALUES CANNOT
BE LEGISLATED
J. J. Valentine Talks of
Finance Before the
Ebell Society.
HISTORY OF CURRENCY.
From the Time cf a Shell Ex
change Until Gold Became
the Standard.
NATUKE ALONE CAN GOVEEN.
Governments and Conventions Cannot
Control the Commercial Value of
Either of the Meta's.
Oaxlahd Omci Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 10. f
J. J.Valentine, president of Wells, Fargo
& Co., addressed tbe Ebell Society this
evening on "Silver." The Ebell Society
is composed of ladies who meet regularly
rOHN J. VALENTINE, Who Declares That Governments and
Conventions Cannot Create Values,
for intellectual discussion and is the lead
ing ladies' club in Oakland.
The speaker opened his address by quot
ing from Hood's apostrophe to "Gold."
"Of all things in the world money,
â which can least bear tampering with on
anything but scientific treatment," said
Mr. Valentine, "is being made in this
country the bone of noisy contention, in
otigated by the influence of mining inter
ests, which ardently desire to raise the
price of silver, and the adherents of a
Boft-nioney heresy, who hope to create
abundant money out of metal of some
kind if they cannot have inconvertible
paper. The natural law of money is, in
general, the law of civilizationâbegin
ning, it may De, with the barter of a
horse for a cow or a goat for a dog. Then
came pebbles, then iron, tben copper and
brass, then silver, and filially gold and
obligations expressed in paper, showing
throughout tha law of displacement of
the inferior by the superior."
After reviewing the historical evolution
of money the speaker proceeded:
"If the coinage of a country consists
only of a single metal, as in the early
coinage of England, and chipped, de
graded and debased coins be allowed to
pass current with good coin all the good
coin will disappear from circulation. It is
either hoarded, melted down or exported.
All laws are ineffectual to prevent this;
the chipped, degraded and debasedjeoin
will alone remain current.
"If coins of two kinds of metals, such
as gold and silver, are allowed to pass cur
rent together in unlimited quantities and
if a legal ratio is attempted to be enforced
between them which differs from their rel
ative value in the markets of the world
the coin which is underrated disappears
from circulation. It is either hoarded,
melted down oreiDorted, and that whicnis
overrated alone remains current. The law
holds good also in regard to bank note
circulation.
"This law is not confined to single and
separate countries; it is not limited in
time or space â it is absolutely univer
sal. The Oresme-Gresham law was ex
pounded to the Government of Great
]3ritain by Locke, Newton and other
eminent men of the times; but a knowl
edge of its workines did not reveal to
them a remedy for continually existing
and recurring evils of coinage. A solution
was found by Sir William .Petty in 1691â
to make one metal the standard money
and the other subsidiary to it; that so
much subsidiary coin an could be Kept in
free circulation, redeemable on or ex
changeable with the standard metal coins,
was not only the best, but the only
method practicable for using both;
that there could, of course, be no
Buch thing as a double standard, and the
greatest stability of monty was to be at
tained by using one metal as a standard.
This theory was eluborated iarer by
Adam Smith. It was the unbroken expe
rience of centuries when Locke took tip
the question in England, as it has been
the experience ever since, that immedi
ately aide by side with the legal ratio
there is a market ratio, and there is no
discernible tendency for the former to
govern the Jatter.
"The laws that finally govern finance
are not made in conventions or congresses.
The foundation of the international bi
metallic theory â a purely emperical prop
osition â is thus erroneous from the begin
ning.
"It is not claimed by any prominent ad
vocates of bimetallism that the unre
plricted coinage of silver by any one gov
ernment, even maintaining a gold stand
ard, couid be otherwise than disastrous.
On the contrary, they declare in print
that it would be calamitous and that they
do not desire to debase the standard of
value; that they would have every debt
paid in gold or its equivalent. And this
is the attitude of bimetallists generally in
Great Britain and Continental Europe,
to all of which I remark: When tbe two
metals have unlimited free coinage at
fixed ratios and are lesai tender the
cheaper will under all possible circum
stances drive the dearer out of circulation.
"There can be no such thing as a double
standard. We must have either gold or
silver alone as our standard. Government
cannot create values. Ttie current value
of moneys is determined independently
of the decrees of kings, legislative enact
ment, or Government fiat.
"In the matter of values commercial
convenience rule*. These things are not
determined by kinus, governments, con
gresses, or conventions, but by tbe silent
and unseen but invincible forces of uni
versal self-interest. All reasoning which
assumes that in the exchange of moneys
any principle can be substituted for that
of individual seif-i:iterest must be futile
and delusive.
''Money is not a question of politics or
sentiment, but of science and etaics and of
superlative importance. To deal with it
on any other basis is erroneous. Money
is constantly rebellious to the mandates
of Government. It comes without being
called and eoes without beinjr arrested â
is deaf to advances ana insensible to
threats."

OAKLAND, Cal., Srpt, 10.â The aeed

I 813 Madison street to-day by Deputy Sher-
I iff AI W'bite. The place was formerly

BIG SURPRISE IN STORE
Alameda Electric-Light Plant
Will Lower the Tax
Levy.
It Will Produce an Income to the
City and There Will Be No Ex
pense for Street Lights.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept 10.â The t*3
levy of this city will probably be made ai
the first meeting of the Board of Trustee!
j in October, but the members are alreaaj
j figuring on the proposition, and they hav<
I a surprise in store for the tax-payer tha'
will be pleasing, without doubt.
Last year the tax rate was $1 24 on eacr
$100 valuation. This year the members o
the board expect to come within a dollai
i limit. Many of the estimates of the vari
i ous departments are already in, and tin
I rest have made an approximation thai
i will do to make an estimate with, and it i<
found that, with the $12,000 that the elec
tiic plant is expected to brim: into the citj
treasury, the city can get along very nicely
) on a dollar levy.
This will be the first experience th<
municipality has had in municipal own
ership reducing taxes, and it is expected
that the lesson will be so pleasant as to
make many of the property-owners wish
j that many more of the city's needs could
j be supplied from municipal plants.
The Uomemen'a Meet.
ALA la EDA, Cal., Sept. 10.â Entries
are beinÂ« made daily for the races which
will be held on Saturday, September 26,
and the indications are good for a suc
cessful i eet.
Dave Martin, who drives one of the fast
est horses in town and takes a preat inter
est in sportine event*, said toÂ»day: "We
have a fine tract and everything in first
class order on it. Ws have already enough
material entered to make it one of the
best meets ever held on this side of the
bay. The track is simply superb."
An Evening of Song.
ALAMEDA. Cal., Sept. 10.â The King s
Daughters of the First Congregational

THIS SAN FKANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 18y<5.
CHARLES JOHNSON (Halstrom), Who Refuses to Explain to His
Brother the Disappearance of His Little Son.
CO-EDS ARE CENSURED.
Berkeley Young Women Lec
tured for Participating in
a Rush.
Rev. Dr. Payne, P.istor of the Uni
tarian Society, Presents His
Resignation.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 10.â The co-eds
at the State University were chastised by
the faculty to day for participating in the
"rush" of last Monday. President Kellogg
called them together at the noon hour
and, in company with Professors String
ham and Soule, administered a consider
i able amount of sound advice to thi young
women, cautioning them against the
repetition of such unladylike conduct 83
some of them had been guilty of. The
president expressed the displeasure of tbe
faculty at the co-eds taking part in the
rough contests of the men students, de
claring that he had been deeply grieved to
hear of it.
Professor Soule, who saw Monday's
rush, expressed the opinion that such
contests were not for lady students, and
declared that no good would come to the
university by their participating in class
rights. Professor Stringhani called atten
tion to the publishea reports of the recent
Stanford rush, in which it was stated that
the Palo Alto ladies did not take part, as
in Berkeley, and sail that the State Vv.i
varsity would be injured by a repetition ol
i Monday's scenes aud that comparisons
with Stanford, to the detriment of Berke
ley, were being made.
The co-eds are much wrought up over
the lectures given to them by the pro
fessors, as they say a reflection is cast on
the whole body of women students, while
only about a dozen put of the entire 400 at
Berkeley took part in the rush. Small in
j dignation meetings were held all after
noon among the young women.
Rev. Wr. Payne Refligns.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 10â Rev. Ed
ward B. Payne, pastor of the Unitarian
Society of Berkeley, has tendered his
r-signation to the board of trustees. No
action lias yet been taken on his resigna
tion, and consequently the date of his
ieaviiitr remains uncertain.
He states that his work in the pulpit
here will close with the present year at
least. Dr. Payne ha 3 been pastor of the
church continuously since its foundation
Rev. E. B. Payne of Berkeley.
in 1891. He was president of the Altruria
Colony Association while it lasted, and
editor of^the Altruria during its lifetime.
The Unitarian Society has a membership
of about one hundred at the present time,
including a large number of professors
and their families, and is in a flourishing
condition.
They have been holding their meetings
at Stites' Hall for the past two years and
were about to erect a building of their
own.
No reason is given for the resicnation of
Dr. Payne, nor has his future field of
labor been made known.
Visited the University.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Sept. 10.â The State
University was visited to-day by the Na
tional Park Commission, which has been

grounds by Professors Hilgarcl and
Bltchell, and this evening they were enter
tained at dinner by several of the faculty.
They expressed themselves as being much
pleaded with the condition of affairs at
the university.

terested in the growth of the university,
since he delivered an address to the first
graduating class of the institution.

BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 10.â The Rus

SHEEHAN WILL MANAGE.
The Ex-Stanford Man to Run
the Olympic Club
Eleven.
He Will Enlist the Services of Sev
eral of the Bist Play
ers Here.
Jack Sheehan, ex-captain of the Stan
ford baseball team, is to manage the Olym
pic football eleven this season. That in
itself almost assures the local men the
gridiron supremacy of the athletic clubs
of the West, for Sheehan is the intimate
friend of most of the players that until
now have been conceded to bo Reliance
material.
He was the boon companion at college
of Football Captain .Downing and of
Quarterback Harrelson, and they all with
"Weldon, the new Olympic fullback, be
longed to the same Greek-letter fraternity.
Something of the significance of this
move on the part of the Olympic Club
may be seen when it is asserted that there
is a possibility that even Walton, the cap
tain-elect of the Reliance team, may be
drawn over by the new manager, for Wal
ton himself captained the Stanford nine
one season and another played under
Sheehan's captaincy when the baseball
men made a victorious tour of the North
west in 1894.
Unusually enthusiastic and of a mag
netic temperament Sheehan was, aside
from his prominence as a baseball-player,
one of the most popular collegians during
his four years at Palo Alto. Last season
after graduation he captained the Olym
pic baseball team for a short time, then
gave up athletics and devoted himsell en
tirely, to preparing for the Supreme Court
examination, which he recently passed
and was admitted to the bar.
The new Olympic manager is a son of
General John F. Sneehan of this City.
Leonard Gill, a former director of the
Olympic Club, in resigning last night
from the management of the team, did so
fully acquiescing in the change which he
himself had helped to plan. For some
little time the plan was afloat, Sheehan
meanwhile quietly working among the
old Stanford players. The result is Har
relson, who played with Reliance last
year, will be with the Olympics this sea
son, anil Downing, another Reliance
standby, will wear an Olympic suit if an
injured hand does not prevent him from
playing at all.
"The Olympics with the material in
sight, should have the best team they
have ever had," said .Sheehan last night.
"I like football too well to Keep out of it'
and this position, with the season's games
all in this City, will require little more
time than I would naturally spend talking
over the prospects with fellows at the
ciub. .
"There are several thlnes I want to see
accomplished. I want to see the team
mure like a college eleven, with its intense
loyalty and with no suspicion of question
able tactics unbecoming amateurs. I want
to see the Multnomabs of Portland and
the Butto team come down here and meet
the Olympics, for we should be in a posi
tion this year whero other teams must
come to us. If possible we may make a
southern trip about Christmas time, but
outside of that we will be satisfied with a
rattling good season right here, as the
schedule already arranged with the two
universities and Reliance insures a game
every Saturday from October 3 on." .

Dick Wllliama' Case Postponed,
Dick Williams was not sentenced yesterday
as was generally expected. His new attorney,
George D. Collins, set up the claim that the
evidence la the recent trial had not been
transcribed, consequently he wsb not in a po
sition to make an intelligent plea for Â«i new
trial. On this ground he asked for a continu
ance until to-day, which was granted. After
court adjourned Collins sought Judge Morrow
in chambers and made an Ineffectual effort to
secure the release of his client on bail. He
offered to pat up a bond of from $20,000 to
$25,000, but his Honor declined to eutertain
the proposition.
On the tower of the parish church of
Bicknoller, Somerset, is growina a yew

that it owes its origin to a seed dropped by

MYSTERY OF A
MISSING NEPHEW
A Romantic Tale Told to
the Children's Society's
Secretary.
LOST ON THE EIVER.
Little Arthur Left Oakland in a
Boat With His Father Many
Weeks Ago.
NOW HE CANNOT BE FOUND.
His Father His Giv.n Many Explana
tions, All of Which Have Been
Proved to Be False.
Oakland Officb San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 10. f
Henry Johnson has called the attention
of the police and the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children to the
peculiar circumstances attending the dis
appearance of his aephew, Arthur Hal
strom, a 9-year-old boy.
Charles Halstrom, the father of the boy,
or really Charles Johnson, is a brother
of the man who is anxious to regain his
nephew.
The story told by Henry Johnson is re
markable in many of its leading features,
fie says: "Charles and I were separated
in Sweden and met in an Oakland saloon
about two years ago, after being apart for
twenty-two years. Some time ago he
married a younc widow and she is the
mother of the little boy who is missing.
His mother is now dead. After her death
my brother went East.
"Then he went to Denver and later came
to Oakland and it was here I met him.
'â¢Several times in ray presence Charles
was very cruel to the boy, and once he
was arrested, but tha boy was so fright
ened he did not stick to his story and his
father was not convicted. Several weeks
later Mrs. Prescott met my brother and
told him to send Arthur up to her office,
as she wanted to talk with him. He did
not come, and upon further inquiry she
found that he had been missing some
time.
"A search was made, and it was discov
ered that Halstrom had bought a boat
with a caDin from Mayor Davie for $10,
in which he proposed to live at the foot of
Broadway to save rent. He took the boy
aboard and left for Stockton, intending to
buy up old junk on his way.
"Nothing could be done until the return
trip, when Mrs. Prescott casually met Mr.
Halstrom on the street, though he tried to
avoid her. She took him to account for
his broken promises and taking tiie boy
away without notifying the society. He
gave several excuses. Then Mrs. Prescott
asked where the boy was, when she was
told he had run away.
"Halstrom said tne boy had been gone
a week, and he had reported the matter
to the police, but inquiries show he had
not done so. Soon after he rushed Into the
office of the society and told Mrs. Prescott
the boy had been found and was stopping
with an aunt in East Oakland. Mrs.
Prescott went to the place, only to find
that there was nothing known of the
cnild. In fact, the child has no aunt in
this country.
"I believe the boy is dead and that he
came to his death between here and
Stockton. Whether he was frightened to
death or fell overboard I don't know. 1
believe my brother is picking hops in
Yolo County now. and I am very anxious
that ho be required to produce that little
boy.
"Mrs. Prescott shares my belief that the
child is not alive, and when his father
comes within her jurisdiction she will
take steps to at once make him account
for that child."

Rabe, who is one of the charter members
of the new Supreme Lodge of the Order
of Modern Trojans, mentioned in to-day's

order:
"The idea that the new order is to be a
political organization seems to be current.
I wish to state that it has nothing in com
mon with the A. P. A. or lodges of like
character. It is purely a benelicial order.
It wili be on the plans of the Woodmen,
Workmen and such orders, only that
we will have the benefit of thair experi
ence and will take thÂ» cream of each.
There is f 1,300,000 sent Enst from Califor

State and County Tax.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 10.â The Super
visors are figuring on a county tax rate
which they will have to consider in a few
days. The rate last year was 50 cents,
which, with a State rate of 68 cents, made
$1 18 inside corporated cities, and with the
35 cents for road purposes made $1 53 in
the outside district.
It is expected that the rate this year
will be slightly higher for county pur
poses, as the election alone will be fio,ooo
additional expense, besides what may be
required for a new bridge ovrr the tidal
canal in case the War Department orders
the present structure removed.

YE YING'S ADVENTURES.
The Editor of the Chinese War
Cry Takes Part in an
Exhibition.
General Booth Brought Samples of
Army Work Frcm Every Quarter
cf the Glob?.
Chinatown has been without its War Cry
for nearly two months, but this wees
there will be a gala number to celebrate
the return of Ye Ying, the enterprising
editor. Mongolian curiosity is stirred up
to a high pitch to hear the wonderful
adventures that befell Ye Ying in Darkest
London.
The editor set out for the British capital
on August 18 to take part in the great Sal
vation Army International Exposition,
and ho has just returned. The
sights he saw there were probably
unique in the religious history of the
world. In the vast Agricultural Hall at
Islington General Booth and his soldiers
had arranged an exposition of the army's
work in every hemisphere and brought
natives from every country where they
have planted their standard to testify.
There was an Indian village, the swarthy
white-robed natives of which wore the
badge of the army; the same badge was
worn in a Zulu kraal, which was presided
over by a genuine chief.
There were also a Scandinavian peasant
village, a settlement of Lapland huts,
Dutch, Italian and other Continental cot
tages, settlements of Dutch Boers, of Cin
galese, Japanese, Malayans and half a
duzen other lands where the Salvation
Army has taken a foothold.
But Ye Ying says ibis was only a small
part of the vast exhibition. Army work
of eveiy kind was shownâ rescue notues,
receiving homes, hospitals, laundries,
shelters, factories. Misery row in Darkest
London, ami slum work in many of the
world's big cities, while the night shelter
was kept supplied with London tramps
during the ten days that the exhibition re
mained open.
Ye Ying says that everyday he sat down
to table with men of seventeen different
nationalities and races, and that the ser
vices of interpreters were greatly in de
mand. "There were editors of War Cries
in thirteen different languages," he said.
"All of them testified, but many of them
had to use interpreters. Yes; 1 was able
to speak in English.
"There was an average of 10,000 people
a day who visited the exhibition and
many conversions were made. General
Booth is very anxious to begin work in
China, and to raise funds he has started a
tea leaguÂ« in London.
"All the people who join the league
pledge themselves to buy their tea from
the army and the profits are to be devoted
to starting army work in China."
Commander Booth-Tucker informed Ye
Ying when he passed through New York
that it was his intention to establish a
Salvation Army Chinese training home,
for the purpose of equipping soldiers to
undertake army work in China. The loca
tion of this home is not yet decided upon,
but probably it will be in San Francisco.
Next Tuesday there \vill be a welcome
meeting in Congress Hall to fete the re
turn of Ye Ying to his editorial duties.
Several billiard tables have just been
dispatched to Bulnwayo.

Company.
CAPITAL, TWENTY MILLIONS.
Allotment and Reservation ol the
Shares Now to Be Issue! With
out Exchange.
A meeting of the directors of the San
Francisco Gaslight Company was held
yesterday afternoon at the office of the
corporation on First street. A notice has
been puolished calling for a special meet
ing of stockholders on Monday, October
26. The purpose and object of the meet
inp is to consider and act upon the propo
sition to diminish the capital stock of the
corporation frum |10,000,000, divided into
100,000 shares of the par value of $100 each,
to $300,000. divided into 100.000 shares of
the par value of $3 each.
The steps now taken to diminish the
capital stoct of the company without re
ducing the number of shares will be
understood when ihe details of the con
solidation with the Edison Light, and
Power Company are considered.
From a circular letter which the presi
dent, Joseph B. Crockett, has addressed to
the stockholders the following extracts are
made:
'For some time past there has been
sharp competition in the lighting business
between the San Francisco Gaslight Com
pany and the Edison Light and Power
Company. The boards of directors ofttie
two companies, realizing that possibly in
the future this might lead to serious loss
to both companies, and that the business
of furnishing light and power should be
controlled by one management, and thus
effect a large saving in the general man
agement, establish more uniform rates
between gas and electricity and in many
other ways curtail expenses, have deemed
it advisable to form a new company, to be
kno*n as the 'San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company,' and to transfer to this
new company all the property of the other
two."
Mention is made of the patient investi
gation of the affairs of both companies,
the experiiug oi ihe books and the inspec
tion of machinery, and this general plan
of consolidation is recommended.
"The new company, to be formed from
the other two companies, to be called the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany, capital stock $20,000,000, of which
$10,000,000 will be issued to the stock
holders of the San Francisco Gas Light
Company, $2,750,000 to be issued to the
stockholders of ihe Edison Light and
Power Company and $1,066,666 to be placed
in trust in the hands of Â» trustee selected
by the directors of the new company,
which said stock is to be placed in escrow
for the purpose of redeeming the out
standing bonds of tne Edison Light and
Power Company. All the remainder of
the stock is to be held in the hands of the
company, and will not be issued unless
necessity reauires the same for the en
largement, extension or improvement of
tue plant."
It seems that when certain bonus of the
Edison Light and Power Company were
L-s>ue\i the hoiders were given an option to
exchange the bonds for stock witnin a
period of ten years. Five years' time has
elapsed, but during me next five years
some oi the bondiiolders may elect to
take aiock, hence the reservation of $1,
-066,666. The unissued stock, amounting
to $6,183,334, may be issued in the
future should the expansion of the City
require an enlargement of the plant and
extension of lighting facilities.
Tne San Francisco Gasligut Company
having but it* current monthly debts to
pay could disincorporate and go out of
business, but as there are real estate and
other assets, such as the property at the
foot of King street, remaining in the cor
poration it will not disincorporate, but
will reduce its capital stock to $300,000,
which is sufficient to carry the real estate
unsold. The stockholders will formally
consider this proposition at the meeting
on October 26.
President Crockett's circular to the
holders of the stock of the gas company
says: "It will be necessary for all the I
stockholders of the San Francisco Gas
light Company to surrender their present
stock and to receive in exchange therefor
an equal number of shares oi stock of the
fcan Francisco Gaslight Company repre
senting the reai estate interests, the par
vaiue of which will be $3 per share, and
also to receive the same number of shares
of the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company."
The president holds that with econom
ical management the new company will
be able to earn and pay a fair dividend
and gradually be able to reduce the price
of light to the consumer.
LAKE TAHOE EXPEDITION
Leading Railway Men on a
Journey of Observa
tion
A Railroad From Truckee to Taho:
City May Be Con
structed.
Last evening a party consisting of Col
onel C. F. Crocker, Julius Kruttschnitt, C.
B. Alexander, William F. Herrin, W. H.
Mills, Jerome A. Hart and Colonel J. B.
Wright left for Lake Tahoe, via Placerville
and Strawberry Mountain. They will
drive leisurely over the mountain roaa
from PJa.cervilie to the lake. At Tallac
they will board the steamer and proceed
to Tahoe City, returning to San Francisco
via Truckee.
Colonel Crocker said yesterday that the
Southern Pacific Company had no plans
in view for railroad extension from Piacer
ville to Lake Tahoe. "We are going,"
naid Colonel Crocker, "from Placerville to
Lake Tahoe for the pleasure of the outing.
No plans of railroad extension in this re
gion are in contemplation. We expect to
have a ><ood time on the trip, and that is
all there is in it."
Lake Tahoe is attracting an unusual
mtmber of visitors this season. It is the
talk up there that a railroad from Truckee
to Tahoe City, a distance of fourteen
miles, will be constructed within ei^nteen
months. William Greer Harrison has
made two vacation trips to Tahoe this
season. He says that if this magnificent
lake, with the beautiful mountain scenery
surrounding it, were in any other part oi
the civilized world there would be a thou
sand villas from which the changing
colors of the water could be viewed.
Mr. Harrison is sure that a railroad will
soon be built from Truckee to Tahoe City.
Data came into ij is possession recently
which convince him that capital can be
procured to construct the road.
On the proposed line from Truckee to
Tahoe City there are few natnral obstacles
to the construction of a railway. Mr. Har
rison understands that the plans under
consideration by capitalists contemplate
the erection of a fine hotel near Tahoe City.
Grand Larceny Charged.
Kate Murphy, 348 Minna street, swore to a
complaint in Judge Joachimseu's court yester
day, charging John Dougherty, an employe in
Brown's hardware sture, Fourth and Market
streets, with grand larceny. She said Dough
erty was sent to her house a few days ago to
do some work and after he departed she missed
a diamond rinc; valued at $150. a sealskin
purse worth $12 and her bankbook.

said district, and a like tax of 35 cents on the dol
lar has beeu levied on School District No. 2 at
Williams, to create a sinking fund and for the
payment of interest of the bonds of the district.
The Los Angeles Times says that the banks in
Los Angeles County have been calling In outside
loans, and as a consequence there has been an in
crease in the number of mortgages, the people bor
rowing money on their real estate. For small
loans on City property, running from 200 to $800,
10 per cent net is asked. On sums of $1000 and
over money can be had in limited amounts at a
per ci-n. net.
A suit has been filed In the Superior Court at
Seattle by the State Trust Company to toreclose a
mortgage of $160,000 against the l'ugei bound
Dry dock Company. The .- lute Trust Company is
of .New York. Jn the suit the complainant nsks
that dward A. Spauldlng, who was appointed re
ceiver by the Superior -Court of â â¢ Tierce County,

Company on .November 1, 1892, executed nrÂ»t
mortgage gold bonds to the aggregate amount of
$15u.000, there being 150 bonds of frIUOO each.
tor these, the company promised to pay face
value on November 1, 191 and interest at 6 per
cent, payable semi-anuualiy. li Â«i, agreed that
in case default of nine;y days was made in the

gage be declared a first lien on all nroperty as
security for the payment of the bonds and that
the property be sol.i at Sheriff's sale.

THE EQUALIZERS DENOUNCED.
Raising the City's Assess=
ment Roll Branded as
Unequal and Unjust.
CITIZENS RISE AGAINST THE
ADDED BURDEN.
The State Board Transcended Its
Lawful Powers in Forcing an
Arbitrary Increase.
IMMEDIATE INJUNCTION FROM THE
SUPREME COURT WANTED.
Merchants' Association and the Citizens'
Charter Association Unite in the Popu=
lar Demand for Relief.
RESOLVED, By the citizens, mer
chants and taxpayers of San Francisco
in meeting assembled this tenth (10th)
day of September, 1896, that we em
phatically denounce this arbitrary
action of Messrs. 3lorehnu.se, Beanier
and Arnold in the State Board of Equal
ization, as unequal, unjust and unfair.
RESOLVED, That a sense of justice
should prevail, and that the State
Board of Equalization make public
their cause for the increase, since the
assessed valuation of 8357, 000,000
thin year i 8 now raised by them 2O per
cent, while the assessed valuation last
year of $327,000,000 -was accepted by
them as fairly representing the actual
value of all property in this City and
County liable to taxation.
RESOLVED, That the laws of Cali
fornia have clearly defined the prov
ince of the Stale Board of Equalization
to see ihat the asiensment of one county,
as a whole, is equal in per cent of value
to the average assessment of other coun
ties; and that the -tate Board of Equal
ization hag unreasonably and unwar
rantably transcended it* lawful power*
in forcing an arbitrary increase in the
present high valuation of San Francisco;
and that the Board of Supervisors of
this City and County, representing the
municipality, ascertain at once the lÂ«gal
rights of this City to secure an imme
diate injunction from the Supreme Court
of the State of California, in order that
this summary proceeding of the - tat?
Board of Equalization may be judlcia' ly
reviewed and if possible reversed, and
this threatened outrage upon the oeople
of San Francisco frustrated and nullified.
RESOLVED, That a certified copy of
these resolutions be forwarded at once
to the State Board of Equalization at
Sacramento, and to the Board of Super
visors of the City aud County of San
Francisco.
At the quarterly meeting of the Mer
chants' Association last evening in the
hall of the Academy of Sciences, these
resolutions were unanimously adopted.
The Citizens' Charter Association was well
represented by its most active members,
and, as they had no voice in the premises,
they very successfully showed rheirheaity
approval by applauding vigorously. Both
bodies rose up against the increase by the
State Board of Equalization in the valu
ation of the assessment roll of San Fran
cesco, and this was their united expression
of sentiment on the subject.
The_ resolutions were introduced by
Maurice A. Rothchild of the "Wertheimer
Company, a director of the Merchants'
Association, and in conjunction with the
following preamble:
Whereas, The assessed valuation of prop
erty In San Francisco, as made by the Assessor
ttiis yenr exc.eds $357,000,000, showing an
increase of over $100,000,000 during tbe past
ten years and nearly $oO,iÂ»OU, 000 during the
past fiscal year; mid whereas, the present as
sessment of $357,000,000 is equal to $1000
assessment for every man, woman and child
lv the Ciiy end County of ban Francisco, and
proportionately next "to the highest of any
large ciiy in thu United States, and nierher
than tne assessment oi property in any other
county of this State, being 27% per cent
increase in San Francisco durinâ¢ the
last five years as against only IJ^ per
cent Increase in the balance of California;
and whereas, notwithstanding a voluntary
increase by the City of $30,000,000 in the
valuation of San Francisco over last year's
assessment, a majority of one in the State
Board of Equalization has arbitrarily ordered
*n increase of 20 percent In the assessed valu
ation of this City, thus raising the present
assessment roll of San Francisco for State pur
poses to $422,000,000 and burdenfnjr tlie tax
payers of this City with an increase of Â»axes
this year ot about $300,000, thereiore, etc.
F. W. Dohrmann, president of the Mer
chants' Association called the meeting to
order when the hall was comfortably
filled with well-known citizens.
Without delay the quarterly report of
the board of directors was read by J. Rich
ard Freud, secretary of the association.
Among other things the report contained
tne following :
The ramd increase In the membership of the
association is most gratifying to those who
have devotedly watched its progress from
forty-seven members two and oue-hulf years
ago to its present encouraging roll of G59
regular members. During the past quarter the
association has gained 254 new members.
The classified list recently published com
prises over 150 diversified industries. The
total capital represented by tbese numerous
firms exceed! $200,000,000 of the assessable
wealth of San Francisco. When it is remem
bered that nearly all of the members of the
Merchants' Association are business firms, con
taining several partners and many employes,

i It la safe to say that those immediately con-
I nected with tbe association comprise at least
I 5000 representative citizens of Sun Francisco.
Ii is the ardent hope of your board of directors
to announce before the expiration of its term
next May that the roll of the Merchants' Asso
ciation exceeds 1000 regular members.
Comparatively cleau streets was one of the
first results of the Merchants' Assoeiati n.
Since the inauguration of this improved
system of street cleaning a superintendent has
been employed by the association to look after
the streets of the City. The present condition
of the streets justifies the assertion that the
present contractors are faithfully executing
the SDecifications of this association as adopted
by the City.
Your board of directors believe in clean side
walks as well as clean streets. Two sidewalk
sweepers are regularly employed by the asso
ciation, and our efforts in this direction have
j met with such ht arty approval thni we hooe
j it is only a question of a short time when the
City will aad this service, as recommended by
th .- association, to its regular street-cleaning
department.
Tiiis association has made earnest and per
sistent efforts to secure sprinkling of the
streets by the City in a systematic and uni
form manner. We regret to report that the
City authorities have not complied with our
wishes in this particular. It is all the more
inexcusable, because the Rum required for the
purpose does not exceed $10,000 per annum,
an imperceptible amount in the vast annual
appropriations. Believing that the proper
sprinkling of tbe streets of San Francisco with
its high winds and sandy soil involves not
only the comfort but also the hea.th of our in
habitants, your board will never relax its
determined efforts in this direction, until the
streets of our City are systematically sprinkled
by the municipality, as in every otner pro
gressive city in the world.
The failure of the City authorities during
the pust fiscal year to replace the cobbles in
many levei downtown biocks with more mod
ern pavements has been disappointing to the
public. Renewed efforts will be made to
secuieoutof the tax levy for the ensuing fis
cal y<_-ar at ieast sufficient to repave the most
objectionable cobbled blocks in the City. Your
board will continue to experiment with wood,
I a?phaltum, brick and other materials to test
REPUBLICAN COUNTY COMMITTEE.
850 Market Street.
The undersigned special committee, appointed by the Republican
County Committee, unanimously adopted the following resolutions:
Whereas, The State Board of Equalization has arbitrarily raised
the assessment of the City and County of San Francisco 20 per cent
over and above the assessment returned by the Assessor; and
Whereas, The Assessor, after a careful review of the assessable
property of the City, raised the assessed value of the same over
$30,000,000 over the assessment of 1895 ; and
Whereas, !-aid increase is in fact greater than the increase in
the actual value of the property in this City and County during
the past year ; and
Whereas, The people of this City will thereby suffer from unjust
and burdensome taxation ; and
Whereas, -Notwithstanding the strenuous efforts of our repre
sentative in the State Board of Equalization, the Hon. A. Chese
brough, with the co-operation of the Hon. E. P. Colgan, State
Controller, the people of this City and County nave been subjected
to an excessive and unequal proportion of State taxation.
Resolved, That we denounce the said action of the majority of
the State Board of Equalization as unfair and prejudicial to the
: advancement of the interests of the City and County of San Iran-
Cisco, and commend the earnest efforts of those who by their
action and conduct stood up manfully for the cause of honesty
and justice. CHARLES W. MAN WARING,

San Francisco, September 10, 1896.
theircomparative merits for the tuture pave
ment of Market street and other thorough
fares of the City.
The untiring* efforts of this association for
over a year to secure further transfer privi
leges to the public have at last been crowned
with success. The through streetcar service
from the Mission along Kearny street, as well
as the additional transfer privileges to resi
dents of the Western Addition, encourage
your board in the hope that its earnest en
deftvors to have the system of streetcar
transfers extended to every part and portion
of the City, so that a single fare will secure a
continuous trip iv one direction from one end
to the other end of the City.
The rrise in valuation of the assessment
roll is reviewed at length and action was
recommended in the manner presented in
Rothchild's resolutions. With regard to
the charter the report says:
More than a year ago the Merchants' Associa
tion began to consider the momentous ques
tion of securing a new organic law for Snn
Francisco. In trying to improve the material
conditions of this City it soon became apparent
that no permanent reiorms could be effected
nor beneficial results fully secured until the
system of our municipal government had been
changed. Careful study of the new charter
convinced the officers and directors of the
Merchants' Association that it is decidedly
superior to the existing government of San
Francisco. The members of the association
have consistently sustained the position of the
board in its vigorous campaign in favor of the
adoption of the new charter.
TIH immediate result of these efforts of the
Merchants' Association has ben the creation
of tne Citizens' Chartei Association, with
whom it is indeed a great pleasure to hold this
joint meeting to-uight. The sole aim of the
Charter Association Is to secure the ratification
and adoption of the new charter for San Fran
cit-eo, and the Merchants' Association will ever
sustain it in this patriotic work aud always
feel a pardonable pride in its successful achiev
menls.
It was after this interesting document
was read that the formal demand for im
mediate and prompt action at law was
made in Rothchild's resolutions. The
result was greeted with applause, and
without ceremony lit. Dohrmann handed
the chair over to James D. Phelan, who
called the meeting of the Charter Associa
tion to order.
Reports* were submitted by committees
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1896.
on credentials and membership, en finance,
on press and publication, on meetings and
speakers, on law and legislation and on
platforms, on parties and elections. The
committee on credentials reported favora
bly on delegates from several societies and
public bodies of San Francisco.
The report on press and publication was
to the effect that 20.000 copies of the com
plete charter will be printed for free dis
tribution, and that 10,000 additional copies
of the "synopsis" have been printed in
pamphlet form and are now being distrib
uted free. As many as 8000 copies of
James D. Phelan' s essay and 6000 of Post
master McCoppin's speech have been pub
lished.
A comparative pamphlet of the old and
the new laws will be issued to the number
of 75,000. Other addresses on the subject
will be issued.
Several public meetings will be held as
part of the campaign work.
Tbe committee on election reported that
a formal request will be sent to the Board
of Election Commissioners for a definite
answer to the resolutions adopted by the
association reearding election matters.
Edward R. Taylor, chairman of the law
and legislation committee reported as fol
lows:
In regard to the question raised as to
whether there is sufficient provision in the
proposed charter for the eiection of officers
under it I beg to say that I have reached the
conclusion that while the matter is not en
tirely free from all doubt, yet the weight is
decidedly on the side of a construction which
will make the charter effective. This conclu
sion is based upon the following considera
tions: It is a cardinal rule of statutory con
struction that the whole body of the statute
must be examined for the purpose of ascer
taining its general scheme and intent, and
that all contradictions therein must be so
reconciled as to comport with that scheme and
intent. Looking at the proposed charter un
der the stress of tliis rule we are forced to the
conclusion that the scheme of officers therein
set up embraces an elective and an appointive
one.
True, those to be appointed are specifically
mentioned, not only as to the fact of appoint
ment, but as to the manner of appointment,
while as to tbe remaining officers the charter
is silent, except section 26 of article XIV, page
210, wherein the charter provides for vacan
cies as to offices made by the charter "elec
tive," and aiso to officers holding offices mnde
"elective" by the charter holding their offices
until the expiration of the terms fur which
they were elected. This, however, shows be
yond all question that the scheme is one of
elective as well as of appointive officers, and
this being so the courts are bound to presume
that those who are not to be appointed are to
be elected Dy the people. This is re-enforced by
the provision in the schedule as to the first
election to be held for municipal officers under
the charter, which provision must necessarily,
under the rule here invoked, be held to apply
to all officers who can be brought under it;
and this necessurily includes only those wbo
are not to be appointed.
Inat the charter is ambiguous in the matter
here under discussion there can be little
doubt; but it ia by reason of this very am
biguity that construction is called upoD to
perform it.s office. It is never so called upon
where there is no ambiguity. In this latter
case the courts will never add to or subtract
from the statute in order to give it a different
meaning from that plainly set out ; but where
the meaning is ambiguous or is obscure the
courts will even, in the interest of statutory
effectiveness, control the strict letter of the
law when such letter would lead to possible
contradiction or absurdity.

Board of Equalization in raising Ban
Francisco 20 per cent has not been lost
sight of by the City officials, and an im
portant conference was held yesterday
looking to definite action in tbe matter.
Ex-Justice of tbe Supreme Court McKui
stry, who is supposed to be as well if not
better posted on the question of the right
of tbe State board to reassess San Fran
cisco than any one in the City, was called
upon by Colonel C. L. Taylor, chairman
of tbe Finance Committee, and John A.
Russell, clerk of the Board of Supervisors,
and asked to look into the legal aspect of
the matter and determine tbe rights of
tbe municipality in the premises.
Colonel Taylor believes thai the State
board has no ripht to interfere with tbe
valuation of San Francisco property as
ii.xed for th* purposes of local taxation,
and that tbe law will prevent "the crime,"
as he calls it, of raising the total valuation
of City property.
He thinks that the rate for City and
County purposes should be allowed to
stand as it is now, and that the raise
should fall only on the State's portion.
Thus, if a piece of property is assessed at
$1000, the State's portion for taxation pur
poses will be about $420, ana it is 20 per
rent of this that the chairman of the
Finance Committee wants to add, instead
of 20 per cent of the whole $1000.
Such a measure has been found legal
before and it is hoped to prove it so this
time.
"This is nothing less than a crime," said
Colonel Taylor last evening, "but we shall
try to mitigate the consequences as much
as possible. The State board raises the
valuations of the State a total of some
thing over $75,000,000 and we are expected
to dtand over $64,000,000 of this. I think
that the law will prevent the raising of
valuations over and above the amount
devoted to the raising of State taxes, and
that we shall be able to head off the per
petration of another similar crime next
year.
'â If we allow the raise to co over the entire
City, next year when the Assessor fixes
valuations about as they are this year the
State equalizers will call attention to the
fact that valuations are lower and will put
another raise on. This we must prevent
and the way I have mapped out is the
only one in sight as far as I know. Mr,
Russell and myself will meet Judge Me-
Kinslry aeain to-day and try to put the
matter in the proper form to decide the
course we will pursue."
The Cowboy Detective.
K. D. Wilber, 630 Market street, swore to a
complaint in Judge Low's court yesterday
charging Sol Simon, the cowboy detective, with
embezzlement. He alleges tnat Simon on
June 10 bousht a typewriter valued at $75
jrom Annie C. Busteed, promising to five her
the money in a few dnys. He has not done so
and retains possession'of the typewriter.

THE FAIR SISTERS
"HURRY THE CASE"
They Will Move for an
Order to Go to Imme
diate Trial.
THE MINORS' STATUS.
An Answer at Last Filed to
Van R. Faterson's
Contest
A LONG LIST OF DENIALS.
The Interminable Line of Preliminary
Technicalities Bids Fair to Ba
Brought to a Close.
The attorneys for Theresa A. Oelrichs
and Virginia Fair, Messrs. Garber, Boalt
& Bishop, Lloyd & Wood and Wilson <fc
WilÃon, yesterday filed their answer to
Van R. Paterson's fourth amended op
position to the Fair will of the 24th; and
not only that, they gave notice that they
would move the court to-day for an order
setting the cause for immediate trial.
Tuis wears the appearance of really
"expediting the case" and no doubt the
proceedings this morning will have more
than their usual interest.
In the answer filed the defendants deny
that Van R. Paterson was ever appointed
by the court to contest the will of Septem
ber 24; they deny that that will was not
dated, written and signed by James G.
Fair, basing their denial on the ground
that they "have no information or belief
upon the subject safficient to enable them
to answer"; they deny that under the will
of the 24th the contesting heirs would
take less than under tue will of the 21st.
They make the separate answer and de
fense that the plaintiffs are not interested
in the estate of the deceased; that the
only claim of interest in the estate of the
deceased which the minor contestants
make adversely to the will of the executor
is under the will of the 21st, "which docu
ment is the same which the minor con
testants in the amended opposition aver to
be the last will and testament of the de
ceased."
The answer goes on to state that on the
21st of September and at tne time of his
death the deceased was tne owner of a
tract of some thirty blocks of unimproved
land valued at several million dollars,
which at tne time of his death was being
improved at an expenditure of more than
â¦300,000, and it would require a large ex
penditure further to make the land pro
ductive, and that the land was mortgaged
for about $500,000.
It is also stated that the deceased was
owner of personal property valued at seve
ral million dollars and that the area of
the unimproved land belonging to the
estate in this City and County alone is
such that the entire amount of the Der
sonal property might be consumeJ in so
improving the said realty to make the
same productive of income.
The defendants pray that the court pro
ceed to try first the issue herein joined as
to the interest and right of Herman
Oelrichs Jr. and of Wesley E. Crothers
(son of Margaret J. Crothers), and of
Emma Fair, Eva Lena Fair. John Fair and
Virginia Fair (children of William Fair),
and James Fair (son of Andrew Fair).
Notice was given that Theresa A. Oel
richa and Virginia Fair will move the
court this morning for an order that the
issues as to the status and right of the
minors be determined before any other
issue and that the court set the cause for
immediate trial.

A L,ady Well Known In California
Passes Away in Calais.
The Calais Advertiser of Wednesday,
August 12, contains the following notice of
the death of an estimable California lady:
"Mrs. Bessie McLeod Loring of California
died at the residence of W. H. Allen on
Monday, August 10, aged 40 years. She
was Mrs. Allen's niece, but was always re
garded and treated as a younger sister,
her mother having died when Mrs.
Loring was in her infancy. She came
to our city with her two boys last Sep
tember. Her husband is now on his
way, hopine to arrive in season to see
his wife once more before the final partin ;
but this ;s not to be his privilege. Mrs.
Lorine has been in frail health for years,

prove a permanent benefit. She suffered
greatly dunntr her last illness, but with
marvelous patience has been uncomplain
ing. She was beautiful in person and in
character, and had many friends in Cali
fornia as well as in Maine. Besides her
husband she leaves two promising sons,

expected that the funeral will occur on
Saturday at 2:30 o'clock standard."

TWO YOUTHFUL FOOTPADS
They Hold Up a Messenger-Boy
and Rob Him of a
Scarfpin.
Nick Murphy, One of the Youngsters,
Arrested, the 0 her Made His
Escape.
James Robinson, a messenger-boy, em
ployed by the San Francisco District
Telegraph Company, was assaulted and
robbed on Sansome street last evening at
6 o'clock by Nick Murphy, a street Arab,
13 years of age, and another youngster
whose name is unknown.
Robinson was on his way to the King
Morse canning establishment, corner of
Sansome street and Broadway, wnen the
robbery occurred. He reached Jackson
street, and was about to cross Sansome,
when he was confronted by Murphy and
his young "pal."
These two embryo footpads imme
diately sailed into the messenger, with the
object in view of making a tborougn
and up-to-date job. Finding that the
messenger had no money on his person,
Murphy, as alleged by Robinson, grabbed
his scarfpin, valued at %'l or $3, and, ac
companied by his partner in crime, ran
down the street.
Robinson reported the case to Policeman
Dwyer, who, after a short search, located
Murphy and placed him under arrest.
The youthful prisoner was taken to the
California- street Police station, where he
was identified by Robinson as the boy who
stole his pin. Young Murp y refuses to
give tbe name of his pal who, in all proba
bility, will escape arrest.

Chris Christiansen Arrested for At
tempting to Enter the Keaidence
of George McCraith.
Chris Christiansen, a waiter 21 years of

tempted burglary, and the case was con
tinued till to-morrow.

night, and was fared at and shot by Mc-
Craitb.
They went to the house cf his brother
2125 Fifteenth street, where he resided
and found him in bed. He had a wound
in his scalp, and after hearing his story
the lieutenant asked to see his hat. His
brother brought ii, and there were bullet
holes in the crown and brim. The lieu
tenant made Christiansen dress himself
and placed him under arrest.
McCraith says he resembles ti-.e burglar
in size and build, but he could swear to
his voice, as he heard him cry out when
He shot him.
