VERY DEAR
THE PRICE,
Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr.
Loses a Hundred Million
by Marriage.
THROWS AWAY A VAST
INHERITANCE.
But Miss Grace Wilson Makes
a Most Charming Bride
Indeed.
AGE OF COURSE CUTS NO FIGURE
IN TRUE LOVE.
The Groom Looks Pale and Worried
After the Performance of the
Simp Ceremony.
NEW YORK. N. V., Aug. 3.â Despite
the determined opposition of his family
and in defiance of the threat of being dis
inherited Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr. was
married to-day to Miss Grace Wilson.
Mr. Vanderbilt Sr. warned the young
man that if he contracted the marriage he
would have to depend upon his own re
sources for a livelihood and he need expect
no share of the Vanderbilt fortune. Thus
the son by disobeying his father's wishes
threw away his prospects of inheriting a
large lump of the $100,000,000 which Mr.
Vanderbilt Sr. is estimated to be wort*.
Not a member of the Vanderbilt family
was even invited to the wedding.
It was 11:15 o'clock when Mr. Vander
derbiit Jr. reached the Wilson house at
511 Fifth avenue. He found awaiting him
his bride-elect, Mr, and Mrs. Orme Wilson,
Mr. and Mrs. Richard T. Wilson, R. T.
Wilson Jr., Robert Goelet Jr. and Frank
Polk of Boston, one of his classmates.
This comprised the wedding party.
Shortly before noon the Rev. William H.
Scott, assistant to Dr. Brown, rector of St.
Thomas Church, entered ihe house.
The rear drawing-room had been dain
tily decorated with a few choice cut flowers
early in the morniDg, and at noon every
thing wa3 in readiness for the ceremony,
wnen the Rev. Mr. Pott took up a position
â¢t the eastern end of the room. A mo
ment later young Mr. Vanderbilt entered
the room, accompanied by his beat man,
Mr. PoLk, The few guests then grouped
themselves to the left of the minister.
The strains of music from an orchestra an
nounced the coming of the bride.
Miss Wilson, attended solely by her
father, marched down the main hall and
through the center archway leading to the
rear drawing-room. She looked a picture
of beauty in her pure-white wedding
gown, a creation of French art. She wore
a veil of extreme old English lace, reach
ing to the bottom of her gown. It was
fastened by a magnificent wreath of
diamonds, surmounted by a bunch of
orange blossoms. As soon as Miss Wilson
entered the room the groom stepped for
ward and, tatting her by the hand, they
both stepped before the officiating minis
ter. In five minutes it was all over and
Miss Wilson was the wife of the son of one
of America's greatest millionaires. There
were no ushers and many of the conven
tionalities attending such weddings were
omitted.
After the ceremony the small gathering
offered their congratulations to the young
couple. No wedding breakiast having
been prepared Mr. and Mrs. Vanderbilt
repaired to apartments upstairs and
donned their traveling apparel. The
bride put on a light-blue striped gown, or
namented with a lace cape. She wore a
large straw bonnet gayiy trimmed with
flowers and her face was covered with a
white veiL Mr. Vanderbilt wore a large
checked suit of light material, with a
brown Derby hat. At 12 :35 p. m. the bride
and groom, followed by a shower of rice,
left the house and entered a coupe await
ing them at the door.
The groom looked pale and worried.
The bride's face was radiant with smiles,
and as the carriage drew away from the
door she threw kisses to the little group of
wedding guests who had assembled to see
the couple off.
Where the bride and groom will spend
their honeymoon was not given out, but
they were driven to the Grand Central
station and it is understood will go to Sar
atoga. It is said that they have no plans
for the future. They may go abroad for a
year, but this has not been decided, nor
has the place they will make their perma
nent home.
Hardly had the ceremony been finished
before telegrams of congratulations began
arriving. They were principally from
friends of the Wilson family, but some of
Mr. Vanderbilt's chums remembered him.
From across the water c&biegrams of con
gratulations from the Prince of Wales, the
Duke and Duchess of Marlborough, the
Earl and Countess of Pembroke and others
or t c nobility. The groom's gift to the
hride was a large diamond heart composed
of some thirty extremely pretty diamonds
with a beautiful sapphire in the center.
The engagement was announced last
May, and June 4 was set for the marriage.
But 'on June 2 young Vanderbilt was
prostrated with an attack of rheumatism
that caused a postponement of the wed
ding.
The marriage has been regarded with
disfavor by the Vanderbilt family ever
since the engagement was announced,
partly because the lady is somewhat older
than young Vanderbilt and partly because
the Vanderbilts did not regard the Wilsons
as their social equals. Efforts were made
to prevent the match, but they were all
unsuccessful, the young man oaving fully
made up his mind. It was asserted, but
the story was denied, that the recent
severe illness of Cornelius Vanderbilt Sr.
was broueht about by disappointment
over his son's action.
It was reported tnat all sorts of violent
scenes were enacted iv the Vanderbiit
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
house and that the young man was threat
ened with disinheritance and at the end,
it is reported, the young man defied his
father and said that he was going tc marry
the girl at any cost. Vanderbilt is 22 and
Misa Wilson six or seven years older.
UNDER ASSUMED NAMED.
Young Fanderbilt and Bride Begin the
Honeymoon at Saratoga.
SARATOGA, N. V., Aug. 3.â There was
no demonstration attending the arrival
here this afternoon of Cornelius Vander
bilt Jr. aud his bride. Apartments at the
United States Hotel had been engaged for
them under another name, and the pro
prietors were not positive of their coming
until notified by the press representatives.
Dr. John L. Perry, one of the proprietors,
met the young couple at the west entrance
of the hotel near the depot, and escorted
them to a parlor sufte overlooking the
lawn which they whicn they will occupy
while here. What their plans are is not
known as yet.
Mr. Vanderbilt looked somewhat fa
tigued by the trip. On the other hand
Mrs. Vanderbilt was particularly ani
mated and chatted to her husband in a
lively manner as they walked from the
cars at the depot platform and down the
carriage-way to the hotel. The evening
was spent quietly in their parlors, from
which they can enjoy the orchestra selec
tions of the band, which is stationed but a
short distance away.

NORTH DAKOTA GYCLONE.
Destroys Much Property and Cuts Many
Curious Capers, but No Loss of
Life Results.
GRAFTON, N. Dak., Aug. 3.â A cyclone
did considerable damage to buildings one
mile south of here this morning. Peter
Peterson's residence was entirely de
stroyed. There were nine people in the
house, but only two of them were Injured,
most of them taking the precaution to go
into the celiar. An old lady was blown
out in the wreck and badly injured.
A boy 4 years old was badly cut on the
head. "The house was a total loss. An
old man attempted to hold the door from
blowing in and the next thinr be knew he
was still holering the door but it was on
the ground forty feet away. Going east
the cyclone turned a sciioolhouse and
granary around and did more or less
damage.
THRILLING SEA ADTENRUE.
Heroic Rescues by the French Line
Steamer la Bourgogne.
NEW YORK, Y. N., Aug. 3.â The French
line steamer La Bourgogne, which has just
arrived in New York, had a thrilling ex
perience last Tuesday during the voyage
across. At great risk of life and with al
most superhuman efforts the first officer,
commanding the vessel's launch, rescued
the crew of the German bark Ernst, which
the liner met waterlogged and in a sinking
condition.
The bark signaled for assistance and Cap
tain Le Boeuf ordered the launch lowered,
with Lieutenant Notay in command.
Within a moment it was overturned and
its crew was thrown struggling into the
water. They were saved with life lines,
and then Notay volunteered a second at
tempt, which was successful. The small
boa: having been pumped out it was again
launched, but on account of the high seas
it could not get near the Ernst.
The members of the crew jumped over
board and struck out for the liner's boat
and were all safely hauled on board. Two
trips were necessary to bring all the sailors
away from the bark. All ten of tbÂ» ship
wrecked sailors were brought to this city.
SLAIN WHILE SLEEPING,
Maryland Farmer Assassinated
Under Mysterious Cir
cumstances.
His Wife's Admirer Suspected of the
Crime and Tiiere Is Talk
of Lynching.
LA PLATA, Md., Aug. 3. â Charles
County has been the scene of another mys
terious and sensational murder, and it is
possible that another lynching will fol
low.
Late Saturday night James J. Irwin, a
farmer, was found murdered in h's home at
Aliens Fresh, a little hamlet tweive miles
from this place. The bullets had been
fared at him while he was asleep, and both
ol them had entered his brain.
George Matthews, an oysterman, who
lives at Rockport, ten miles distant from
the scene ol the tragedy, has been arrested,
charged with the crime, and Jrwin's wife
is under police surveillance. It is said
that Matthews has been paying marked
attention to Mrs. Irwin, and the authori
ties have letters in their possession con
taining endearing terms, which Matthews
wrote to the woman.
Mrs. Irwin says she discovered that her
husband was dead at 11 o'clock Sunday
night. She ran to the house of her father
in-law, 100 yards distant, and gave the
alarm. She assert; that she was in bed
beside her husband, but evidence at the
Coroner's inquest conflicts with her state
ments. The entire community is in
censed, and if positive guilt could be
fastened on Matthews would un
doubtedly be lynched.
Ji'dUcorery of a Silver Mine.
RICHMOND, Kt., Aug. 3.â What is
believed to be the celebrated Swift silver
mine has been discovered on Roundstone
Creek, thirty miles south of here, in Rock
Castle County. The ore is combined with
lead and smelts at $65 a ton. Down sev
eral feet below the top ledge were found
crucibles and ott.er implements, which
leads to the belief that the mine has been
worked in past years. Old residents say
the location tallies with the direction left
in swat's chart exactly.

TWENTY MILLION
DOLLARS INVOLVED
Financiers Are Startled
by a Very Heavy
Collapse.
MOORE BROTHERS FAIL.
Promoters of the Diamond Match
and New York Biscuit
Companies.
STOCK EXCHANGE TO CLOSE,
Capitalists of Chicago Excited Over a
B g Deal That Culminated in
Disaster.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 3.â Moore Bros.,
promotdrs of the Diamond Match Com
pany and the New York Biscuit Company,
announced to-night that they had failed.
A meeting of prominent financiers and
Chicago bankers was held at midnight at
the residence of one of them on the South
Side, and it was aereed by them to close
the Chicago Stock Exchange indefinitely
to-morrow at 10 a. m. These gentlemen
said it was the only course for them to
pursue, and that as far as they were con
cerned their stock was margined to a
figure which would protect them.
The Stock Exchange will be called to or
der at 10 a. m., when the failure of Moore
Bros, will be announced. The speculative
value of the failure will be about $20,000 -
000.
It ia thought by some that the adjourn
ment of the Stock Exchange will last but
a few days and that matters within that
time can be straightened out in away that
will make the losses as easy as possible to
bear. Diamond Match opened at 222 in
the Chicago Stock Exchange to-day.
There were heavy sales all day, and the
loads that were sold were enormous.
Notwithstanding this the stock did not
break, going only to 221. There were
slight rumors of the difficulties which sur
rounded the Moores, but no one suspected
the crash. New York Biscuit sold early at
92VS. going to 90 shortly after noon. There
was a rally, however, and Biscuit closed at
92.
Those present at the meeting of the di
rectors of the StocK Exchange to-night felt
that should the exchange open as usual
to-morrow morning the bears would make
a slaughtering of values which would cost
a good deal, and in a large measure un
necessary loss.
They believed that the closing of the ex
change and the prevention of the making
of speculative quotations of the securities
would enable brokers having open trades
to close them, and the situation could be
liquidated in a large measure without the
sharp decline that would surely follow the
trading in the open market. So far as the
banks are concerned, they are indiffersnt
generally as to whether the exchange
should be closed or not. The stocks held
by them are margined to a point which
leaves them secure m any event.
There were present at the meeting the
members of the Stock Exchange govern
ing committee and a number of promi
nent capitalists. This meeting was as
sembled informally after the announce
ment which was made late in the after
noon by James H. Moore that margin calls
no longer could be met. The announce
ment was made to a few of the men most
Jkree Men in a Boat â not Counting tke Dog.
heavily interested, and it was thought
1 best to call a meeting to discuss the situa
tion.
Those who assembled discussed the best
means for restoring confidence after the
shock which would be given to speculative
circles by the announcement of the fail
! ure. It was the general opinion that it
would be the wisest possible move to close
the exchange fir a period.
The points were made that nearty the
entire basiues* T>t the Stock* Exchange
for a number cf v/e-eks ha^J been in
Diamond Match and New York Biscuit;
that the closing of the exchange
would interfere only in the slightest
degree with general financial affairs and
that the present was a particularly oppor
tune time, owing to the fact that the set
tlements in the July account had just
been completed and taere had been as yet
comparatively little trading in the August
accounts.
The governing committee of the Stock
Exchange discussed the matter at length
and passed a resolution te adjourn the
exchange at 10 o'clock in the morning
indefinitely.
The deal, of which the failure of Moore
Bros, is the culmination, is by all odds the
most important in the history of the Chi
cago Stock Exchange. It be^an early this
year. The stock of the Diamond Match
Company had been selling about 130 for
quite a time. There had been no special
activity iv the market. Just prior to the
Venezuelan incident the tip went out in
outside circles that there was to be some
important European developments in con
nection witb Diamond Match affairs, and
the buying of stock by strong people com
menced.
The Venezuelan panic interfered with
the speculation and the stock dropped
during the general decline at that time to
115. From then the rise started which is
the most remarkable in the history of the
exchange. A strong group of speculators,
headed by J. H. Moore and William H.
Moore, began buying the stock. It moved
up with scarcely a halt.
In time the announcement was made
that the Diamond Match Company had
closed a contract with the French Govern
ment, under which its patents and the
machines controlled by the match com
pany were to be sold to the French Gov
ernment for a royalty of $100,000 a year.
Following the announcement of the
closing of the French contract the stock
advanced with great lapidity. In the
early speculation the bulls named 200 as
an extreme figure, but as the prospect of
further arrangements in Europe appeared
much higher prices were predicted. Ne
gotiations were opened for the formation
of a new company in England, which
would unite with Bryant <fe May, the larg
est match producers in Great Britain, and
would give the English field the advantage
of the labor-saving American machinery.
A factory was equipped in Liverpool
which was owned by tbe Diamond Match
Company and which served as an object
lesson to European manufacturers, show
ing them the great advantage of improved
machinery over their methods of manu
facture.
Negotiations were opened in Austria for
the formation of a company which should
combine all the manufacturers there.
Other companies were to bo organized in
Belgium and Italy. Calculations showing
enormous profits to accrue made prices
that had at first looked extravagant seem
cheap. The shrewdest men in Chicago be
lieved in the property and the stock sold
up as high as 248.
From that point there was a rapid de
cline, carrying it down to 200. The
Moores went through the break without
the slightest difficulty, and it was believed
generally that they had been glad to see
the decline that more stock might be ac
cumulated. A great part of the capital
with which the deal had been carried on
had been raised in New York and New
England. Local banking institutions are
only moderately interested in the affair.
Difficulty was experienced, it is said,
owing to the general loss ot confidence in
renewing some oi these Eastern loans.

DEFLANT YASKEE SKIPPER.
Refused to Give Up Hi* Men to the Span

BALTIMORE, Md., Aug. 3.â The ; frnit
steamei Brixham, Captain Durie, = has ar
rived â¢ from Gibara, Cuba, with a cargo of
bananas. The order of General "I Wey
that fruit steamers shall not load at inte
rior ports has caused - a blockade of eight
or ten : steamers at Gibara. They must
wait while the bananas are lightered long
distances to the steamers, k General Wey
le'r'a order was issued to prevent filibuster
ing. -â  - â  -V- â  ; : â .:.'â  :
: In consequence of this, Chief Engineer
Carlstoa of . the steamer i Brixham } had a
narrow escape : from f a Spanish dungeon.
A week ago ; two officers of the steamer
lowered a : small boat / from the ; vessel,
which was â  lying at anchor a mile off Gi
bara, and. went out for a sail off the port.
"While skirting the shore a group of * Span
ish officers \on land signaled for the two
officers to come ashore. The two men did
not know what to make of the request,
and j held their J course, disobeying the
summons.' " t O ,
v .'As the men ] bore away ; from " the shore I
the Spaniards put off }in U* sloop ', ana ' be
gan chasing 5 the 'â â  small ; boat â  from Â£ the
Brixham. The sloop ' : gradually > â¢ gained
on the small boat in charge of 'Engineer
Carlston, who pressed on all the canvas
the T : craft would well carry.* When the
officers reached the steamer the Spanish
stoop was only a few feet behind, and the
small ;; boat had ; some :of its -\ rigging
smashed in the hurry to get to the - Brix
ham's gangway .'?â  When the two engineers
leaped on board the Brixham the Spanish i
were almost near enough 1 to reach them.
â  The ; Spaniards, . armed with ' Runs,'- fol-
I lowed the two : men â . aboard the steamer
and demanded that they be surrendered
by Capiain Dune. The captain, with the
American flag flying over his vessel, re
fused the request. Then the Spaniards
suggested that tbe men go ashore and have
the matter settled before the American
Consul, but they refused, fearing the con
sequences if they got on Spanish soil. Tbe
Spaniards then left the vessel and no fur
ther tronble followed.
The vessel was afterward watched by
small Spanish boats and the officers never
went ashore again. Captain Durie stoutly
maintained his right under the American
flag and in that way escaped trouble.

I Minister of Foreign Affairs, to demand the
extradition of Cuban revolutionist Carlos
Roloff, now in the United States. The

ent, writing from Pinar del Rio, reports
: Adela Azucacy, the Cuban Louise Michel

BEATEN BY THEIR FOES,
Enemies of the Single-Taxers
Pack an Indignation Mass*
Meeting.
An Effort to Denounce the Imprison

Defeated.
WILMINGTON, Del., Aug. 3.â An in
dignation mass-meeting of the citizens of
Dover, for the purpose of petitioning the
town authorities for the release of the
Single-taxers now in the Kent County
jail, charged with violation of the town
ordinance prohibiting the obstruction of
the public highway, was billed for to-night
at the opera-house.
Long before the hour set for the meet
ing the theater was crowded, and when
the meeting was called to order nearly
1500 people had forced their way in to take
part m the proceedings. After the meet
ing was called to order a committee of the
citizens, under whose auspices the meet
ing was called, tried to get a resolution
passed calling on the authorities to release
the Single-taxers, but their efforts were in
vain. The enemies of the Single-taxers
had secretly packed the meeting, and, in
stead of a petition for the Sinsle-taxers'
release, the meeting declared in favor of
their imprisonment.
None of the Singie-taxers took part in
the meeting. The resolution was a great
surprise to them. The Single-taxers nave
decided to hold another big street meeting
to-morrow nieht, when it is expected that
half a dozen speakers will be arrested.
They will go to jail and join the others.

PROGRESSIVE ELEMENTS TO AD

They Want a Protective Tariff and
Sound Money Instead of Depre

CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 3.â Major Mc-
Kinley has had a few days of quiet and he
is turning over in his mind the points
which he thinks of discussing in his letter
of acceptance. He will not, however, aim
to have a letter ready for publication for
three or four weeks.
Ex-Senator B. K. Bruce of Mississippi
was one of the callers on Major McKiuiey
to-day. He is familiar with the political
situation throughout the South and thinks
Major McKinley will carry Virginia, West
Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and
Kentucky. Said he:
<; It will be found that the Democratic
politicians in the Southern States have
until recently been able to keep the South
solid. Hereafter the progressive elements
of the South will take such action as will
advance the material prosperity of that
section. They want a protective tariff that
will build up that section; they will invite
the manufacturers and show that it wili do
for the Stales what it has done for the
great North, East and West. They look
upon Major McKinley as the apostle of
protection. They also want sound money
instead of depreciated silver dollars, and
they regard Major McKinley as the em
bodiment of that idea. The colored voters
of the country, both North and South, are
enthusiastically supporting Major Mc-
Kinley."
Much interest in the opening of the Ohio
campaign, which has been announced for
August 15, has been manifested here.
Many active McKinley men in both par
ties tell of going to Columbus, and it is
likely that a large delegation from the
country will attend. Ex-Governor Fora
ker and Senator Sherman will be the chief
speakers, and some orators of prominence
from the West wilt also be heard. Â»
A local paper says: It is expected that
Bryan will pass through Canton next

DOING TERY GOOD WORK.
Convincing Literature la Scattered by
liefntblican Manager*.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 3.â There were
not many visitors of National prominence
at the Republican National headquarters,
and the absence of Committeemen Dur
bin, Payne and Leland served to make the
Mecca of Western Republicans a quiet
place.
L. F. Hubbard, former Governor of Min
nesota, called on his way home to tell the
chiefs that the free-silver sentiment was
on the wane in his State and that Mr.
Towne, the bolting Republican Congress
man for the Sixth District, would be de
feated.
E. V. Smalley of the literary bureau,
who returned to-day from a brief visit to
bis Minnesota home, reported that United
States Senator Nelson, who has already
taken the stump, is sanguine o* Republi
can success in Minnesota, but other Re
publicans of equal standing are doubtful
of the result. The greater portion of the
State is peopled by Scandinavians, wbo
changed from the Republican to the Popu
list party, and had it bad, as Mr. Smalley
expressed it, but are now returning to
vote for McKinley.
John L. Wilson, United States Senator
from Washington, was a caller at head
quarters. He 3aid there was a large free
silver sentiment in his State, but Wash
ington held a unique position in having a
large bimetallic element which had no re
lation to the free-silver vote. This ele
ment wanted to be edncated.
The literary bureau is preparing a
serie3 of pamphlets and leaflets, eight or
ten of which will be out this week. They
will relate to the issue as it affects sugar,
wool and skilled mechanics. Thirty-two
pieces of campaign literature bearing on
the currency question have been prepared
by the bureau, and when the last of them
is sent out to be read the bureau will rest
in its fight against free silver. Over 100
books bearing on the money question that
have been published /or sale generally
have been offered to the committee for
distribution, and when Mr. Hanna comes
to Chicago thvy will be submitted to the
committee to see if tnat body wants to buy
any of them. Telegrams received to-dar
at headquarters state that Chairman
Hanna will be here this week, Thursday
or Friday.

Certa : n That Bryan Will Be
Ekcted,
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 3.â Ex-National
Commit eeman Ben T. Cable, one of the
leaders of the bolting party in II inois.
was read oat of the Democratic party to
day at the meeting of the State Central
Committee, the committee under the
leadership of Chairman Hinrichsen.
It immediately began the work of draw
ing the line which martcs the split in Illi
nois between the silver or regular Demo
crats and the sound-money men or bolt
ers. As a result the places of the following
members of tee committee were Riled by
new men: John P. Hopfcins, Ben T. Cable,
W. S. Foreman and R. E. Spangler, at
large, and A. A. Goodrich, First District.
Of these gentlemen Hopkins and Fore
man had already resigned, and Spangler
handed his resignation to Chairman Hin
richsen before the meeting wbb called to
order.
Ex-Judge Goodrich, who had been de
posed at tbe Peoria convention, was al
ready disposed of, so that the committee
had practically only the caoe of Ben Cable
to handle. As be is regarded as the arch
conspirator against Governor Altgeld and
the present Democratic Organization, *c
was accorded no mercy and no sympathy. ]
Ti:e new members appointed to-day ;
were: A. W. Bastian, vice Cable; E. W. :
Harill, vice Foreman; Alex Jones, vice
Goodrich: Carter H. Harrison and A. S.
Trude, vice Hopkins and Spangler.
The committee listened to reports from
the various districts. And these reports,
according to Mr. Hinrichsen, indicate a
majority outside of Cook County for Wil
liam Bryan of more than 40,000. The
meeting was addressed by Marion C.
Crawford and Major Pace, candidates for
Lieutenant-Governor and Treasurer.
Governor Aitgeld appeared before the
committee at tbe morning session, but
stayed only long enough to inform the
campaign managers in positive terms that
the regular Democrats had only to keep
their grip on the State to make sure of
Bryan getting its electoral Vote. He was
confident that Illinois Was in the bands of
Democrpcy on the free-silver issue.
Chairman Hinrichsen was equally confi
dent and enthusiastic over the outlooK,
saying: "No matter what combination is
made Bryan will get more than half the
votes cast in Illinois in November. It is
truly surprising to note the tide which is
Betting in for free silver in this State. I
admit we will lose a few Democratic votes,
but in a third Of tbe counties the defection
will not be noticeable. Governor Altgeld's
popularity is greatest among the class that
is demanding free stiver and Bryan is
strong in Central and Southern Illinois.
Two of the bankers in my own County of
Morgan are Republicans, but for free sil
ver. The richest man in Sangamon
County, Ben Calciwell, president of the
Farmers' Bank at Springfield, is an enthu
siastic silver man and the Democratic
nominee for Congress."
At the afternoon session of the commit
tee tbe campaign assessments for the State
nominees to pay were fixed and the com
mittee adjourned sine die, leaving to the
executive committee the details of cam
paign preparatory work.
SOVSV-MONEY DEMOCRATS.
JEncour aging Report* ..Received by the
JUrn in Control.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 3. âFour National
Committeemen were added to the list to
day of sound-money Democrats wno will
attend the Indianapolis meeting. W. B.
Haldeman of the National Executive Com
mittee sent word for Georgia that T. B.
Nea\ president of th â â¢ Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce, would represent that State.
Lynde Harrison, a delegate to the late
convention, telegraphed that David A.
Wells of Norwich, tne original free-trader,
Charles K. Root of Waterbury and Joel
Sperry of New Haven would represent
Connecticut at Indianapolis.
Ohio's Nationa Go mmitteemnn in ex-
Congressman J. H. Outhwaite. Texas will
be represented by General Clark, M. L.
Crawford and J. H. Smith.
The committee received a letter from
William T. Jenney, chairman of the
Young Men's Democratic Club of Boston,
stating that tbe club, which bad already a
membership of 1200, had repudiated the
Chicago platform and candidates aud was
engaged in active campaign work.
B. M. Falknerof Montgomery, Ala., who
will represent that State at Indianapolis,
wrote to say that a sound-money club
Would be organized in Birmingham this
week, with probably 1000 signers to the
call, including practically all the business
men of the city. He added: "I believe
that with proper management Alabama
can be carried for sound money. I have
called a conference here of the sound
money men from different parts of Ala
bama for Tuesday next, the day following
our State election."
E. L. May of Montgomery, Ala., wrote:
"The condition of the sound-money senti
ment here is most encouraging, and you
may rely upon it that Alabama will be
heard from in no uncertain tones after our
Btate election is over. Our Eastern friends
are making a grave mistake in supposing
that the Southern people desire the en
thronement of the hydra-headed monster
of free silver. The progressive, solid busi
ness portion of our population are bitterly
opposed to it. Men in this community
who have hitherto looked upon desertion
of tbe Democratic party as a crime would
not hesitate to withdraw their allegiance
rather than become supporters of this
herety."
G. H. Baskette, publisher of the Nash
ville Banner, wrote: "The sound-money
Democrats of Nashville will organize Au
gust 4 and send a representative to the
Indianapolis conference. In Knoxrille,
Chattanooga aud other portions of 'i'en
nessee there will be similar Organizations,
and the State will have full representation
at tbe National Convention iv Septem
ber." /
John C. Bullitt, the Pennsylvania sound
money organizer au<l National Commit
teeman, wrote that a meeting of repre
sentative men from each county in the
State would be called for the purpose of
perfecting the organization.
Alexander Hamilton of Petersburg, Va.,
wrote: "I have no reasonably accurate
mode of estimating the number of Demo
crats in Virginia wno will not vote for
Bryan and the Chicago platfocm, but I am
inclined to think there are 25,000. if no
sound-money Democrat is named for
President a great number of these people
may be whipped into the party traces and
vote for Bryan, rather than not vote at
all."
F. P. Glass, secretary of the Montgom
ery Advertiser, informed the committee
that, a club of over 200 members had been
formed in that city and another strong
club had been organized in Troy. He
added that tbe regular party pressure is
becoming stronger eacn day upon the rank
and file to stand up for the Bryan ticket,
and something in the shape of Democracy
which sound-money men could hold to
Consistently ought to be offered as soon as
possible.
The sound- money organization in Ken
tucky has issued to the Democrats of that
State a vigorous address, urging imme
diate thought and action, as tho condition
which confronts them is as sArious as any
In the history of the country. It lays the
panic and busines3 depression to the
World's distrust of our National financial
integrity.

Colorado Silver Men.
DENVER, Colo., Aug. 3.â The State
Committee of the Nati nal Silver party
held a meeting to-day for the purpose of
discussing the matter of a State ticket.
After several hours of quiet deliberation it
was decided to appoint a committee of
four to confer with similar committees
from the Democratic and Populist parties
with a view to fusion upon the State
ticket and a union upon Bryan and Sewall
electors. But a small minority of Colo*
rado Populists favor the indorsement of
W.itson.
The Republicans are still at sea, though
the effort still continues to secur-signa
tures of State coramittcemen to the call
for another meeting of the committee on
August 12 to repudiate the action of last
Week in indorsing McKinley and the Re
publican National platform.

SPRINGFIELD, 111., Aug. 3.â Senator

"We are not bolters," said he, ''we are

MINNEAPOLIS. Mink., Aug. 3.-âThe
Minnesota State Democratic Convention,
which will be held in this city to-morrow,
promises to be one of the most unanimous
gatherings, politically speaking, ever held
in this State. For Governor .lohn Llnd of
New Ulm, a free-silver Republican, has
the undivided support of the convention.
Every delegation has Lind instructions.
In addition to nominating Lind tne Dem
ocrats will nominate two other Btate offi
cers, probably Secretary of State atd
Treasurer, leaving Lleutenant-Governor
and Attorney-General for the Populists,
who meet in State convention August 24.
With fusion of this sort it is admitted by
even the Clough people that the chances
of victory for the union forces are bright.
SEIZED B Y AN1 OCTOPUS,
Perilous Plight of a Serpentine
Dancer at Manhattan
Loie Fuller's Sister, While Bathing,
Gsts Into the Clutches of a
Slimy Monster.
NEW YORK, N. V., August 3.â Miss Ida
Fuller, the serpentine dancer, a sister to
La Loie Fuller, had a thrilling experience
with what she believes to have been an
octopus at Manhattan Beach.
Mbs Fuller was bathing in front of the
pavilion in company with her brother
Frank, and being an expert swimmer had
gone just beyond the life HneÃ, which ex
tended about 200 feet from the shore.
Her brother was some distance away.
Suddenly the girl felt something Coil itself
around her left leg. She thought it waÂ» a
weed and turned over on her back and
kicked violently. Instead of releasing
her from the entanglement, the stringy
substance seemed to tighten until the
pressure was painful. Still suspecting
nothing more awful than seaweed, Misi
Fuller turned over again and ducked
down, intending to disengage herself with
her hands. She says she then saw a head
from Which hands of stringiike tentacles
swuna and swayed in the water. As she
stooped one of these coiled around her
right thigh.
Cryine "Help!" at the top of her voice,
Miss Fuller struggled to free herself, but
the dutches of the thing, whatever it was,
seemed only too surely to be dragging her
beneath the surface.
After uttering a terrific scream Miss
Fuller fainted in the water, the depth of
which was fully fourteen feet. The only
swimmer near her waa a Mr. Parker.
Hearing a woman scream, he turned and
saw the dancer disappear beneath the
water. With a few vigorous strokes he
reached the place where she sank, and
seizing her held her above the water until
a life-savei came up and hauled the man
and the woman out of the water.
Mr. Parker said bfe felt the long, slimy
arms of the creature, and to prove it ex
hibited marks upon his limbs. The still
unconscious woman was carried to tbe
Manhattan Beaoh Hotel. There she grad
ually revived. Dr. Camphfll, who at
tended her, ?aid ther* were red marks like
the welts of Â« whip on her legs.

Well as a President,
WASHINGTON, D. C. Aug. 3.âSen
ators Jones and Gorman had a long con
ference this morning regarding the work
that will come before the Democratic Na
tional Committee at its meeting in New
York on August 11. A number of topics
were discussati.
It is regarded as absolutely certain that
the management 6f the campaign will be
intrusted to the hands of Mr. Gorman.
Mr. Jones is anxious to be permitted to
name bis Maryland colleague as the chair
man of the executive committee, Mr.
Gorman is willing to serve as manager,
but he is very unwilling to accept the
chairmanship. Mr. Jones believes, how
ever, that bffore the National Committee
meets, Mr. Gorman will give his consent
to be a member of the committee, but not
its chairman. Mr. TurpSe of Indiana is
looked upon as another member of tne
executive committee.
"Gil" Shanklin, who succeeded Secre
tary Si Sheerin as Indiana's member of
the National Committee, has been here
awaiting the arrival of Mr. Jones to press
his own claims to appointment on the
executive committee. There is little rea
son to believe, however, that Mr. Shanklin
will b3 seriously thought Of if Mr. Turpie
is strong enough to accept the appoint
ment. Senator Harris of Tennessee is
spoken of as anotner member.
There has been much gossip printed in
the papers recently about an alleged de
termination of Messrs. Jones and Gorman
to bring out a resolution at the nÂ«xt mret
ing of the committee which will declare
vacant the seats of all members of the
committee who are gold rcen or who have
declared tliernselves unwilling to support
the nominees of the Chicago convention.
It Is stated te-riay on excellent authority
that no such action is contemplated. When
the National Committee met for the first
time at Chicago none of the dissenting
National Committeemon attended the
meeting except Mr. Harrity. They are
not expected to be present at the forth
coming meeting. At the same time there
is no authority vnsted in the committee to
oust these members. Such action rests
entirely with tbe different State commit
tees.
As a matter of fact the National Com
mittee is a purely formal body which
takes little or no part in the active man
agement of the campaign and it is stated
here that no notice will be taken ot the
absence or the presence of the gold men.
Mr. Gorman Is a strong advocate of
Washington as the National headquarters
and his advice Will probably be followed
by the National Committee. As to the
troubles between thÂ« Populists and the
Democrats in the South it has been de
cided that no concessions will be made to
Populists even at the risk of their fusing
with the Republicans as they have done
in Alabama and threaten to do in Georgia.
In the West fusion will be advised every
where.
Senator Faulkner, chairman of tbe Con
gressional Committee will urge on the
National Committee, the necessity for
prompt financial aid and Jones and Gor
man will support his plea that some of the
National Presidential campaign's finances
be diverted to Congressional campaign
work. Mr. Faulkner complains that his
committee is shockingly poor and that it
is unable to help out candidates who need
funds.
Mr. Faulkner will argue that it is as essen
tial to elect a free silver House as it is to
win the White House for Bryan, for with
out a silver Congress the sliver President
can do nothing. This argument is to be
made to the owners of the silver mines
who are expected to prty the bulk of the
Democratic campaign expenses.

PROVIDENCE, R. 1., Aug. 3.â A
meeting of sound money Democrats of
Rhode Island was beld in this city to-day
and resulted in issuing a circular to the
Democrats of the State denouncing the
Chicago platform arid candidates declar
ing that the action of tbe State Central
Committee in ratifying the notion of tbe
Chicago convention was ill advised and in
direct opposition to the last expressed
opinions of the Democrats of the State. A
committee was also appointed to select
delegates to the Indianapolis conference.
Those present at the meeting favored the
indorsement of McKinley on a platform
declaring in favor of tariff for revenue
only.

FRANKFORT, Ky., Aug. 3.â The free
silver Democrats opened the campaign
here this afternoon by a big parade and
speechmaking. The parade was beaded
by a line of cavalry from the country with
crowns of thorns and crosses of gold,
while intervening between every twenty
or thirty horsemen were carried painted
signs with the words, "We shall rout the
goldbugs and Wall street." The cavalry
men wore white shirts with "16 to 1"
painted in large black letters. Addresses
were made by Hon. J. D. Carroll, Judge
Joseph H, Lewis and ex-Attorney-General
William Hendrick.

FRANFORT, Ky., Aug. B.â The thir
teen old franklin County committee
men, all "sound money" men, who were
deposed by the reorganization effected by
the silver Democrats, held a meeting bere
to-day and passed resolutions refusing to
recognize tbe new committee. Their ac
tion is believed to have been under the
direct suggestion from W. C. P. Breckin
ridge, as each member is a strong lriend of
his. This is taken to mean that Breckin
ridge's friends will declare him the Con
gressional nominee and that he wiii make
tbe race.

Keep Out of Politica.
BOSTON, Mass., Aus- 3.-Geor ? e F.
Washburn of this city, Eastern member of
the National Executive Committee of the
People's party, to-day issued the following
challenge to Bishop John P. Newman:
Btihop John P. Newman, San Francisco, Calâ
Dear Sir: The pre>s reports of the last week
credit you with the statement that the Popu
lists are no better than anarchists and are not
good American citizens, and that you -vould
urge the 1000 ministers in your home confer
ence to use their influence in the pulpit and
out of it against the triumph of Bryan and
Sewall and the election of a Silver Congress.
Now, sir, 1 belong to the party you insult, and
brand your alleged statement as false and un
fair, and challenge you to name a single Popu
list in this country who is also known as an
anarchist.
I am called "a leading member" of the
churoh you represent. If 1 am not a "* ood
American citizen" may I a;-k aro my influence
and money still wanted in your church? If
you are no more correct in your ipirituat ut
terances than you are in your political can
we have any confidence in either?
I agree with the prominent Catholic who
said he was willing to take his religion from
the head of his church, but liot his politics.
Now, Bishop, for the t-ake of the church we
lovÂ« and the welfare of the country, I advise
you to let politics alone until you have studied
tnis monetary question. You refer to the atti
tude of our church during the anti-slavery
agitation to justify you in directing your
ministers to preach politics during the cam
paign in*tead of religion. Has it occurred to
you that the result of tttis proposed line of
action may split our church now just as it did
at that time?
Lot me inform you that 00 per cent of the
Populist party are native-born American citi
zens, comprising mostly the sturdy farming
element, which for years the statesmen of
botn the old parties proudly alluded to as the
"bone, sinew and stability of the country."
These men are intelligent, patriotic and true
and are called anarchists became they have be
gun to think. The result of their thinking
will be a surprise party next November.
Again there were more delegates in our del
egations who owned their homes and paid
taxes than that of any*other political party.
May I add, Bishop, that you will find your
own people are not with you politically. Every
Btate in your section will be carried for Bryan,
notwithstanding your residence there.
Lastly, the leading anarchist, Herr Most, Is
for the single gold standard and the Republi
can party, and I defy you to name one in our
ranks as art offset to this. Yours for justice.

HUTCHINSON, Kans., Aug. 3.â The
Democrats of Kansas are arrivitier for their
State Convention, and Bryan, silver and
fusion reign. The convention will be
called toorder to-morrow, and will do little
but appoint a committee on conference to
meet a similar committee from the Popu
list State Convention, which meets
Wednesday at Abilene. The committees
will get together and agree if possible â
first, upon an electoral ticket; second, as
to representation upon a fusion ticket.
There will be no trouble over the electoral
ticket. The Democrats will name a Bryan
and Sewall ticket and desire Populist in
dorsement of the same. The Populists on
the other band are divided on this ques
tion,

ALABAMA STATE
GOES DEMOCRATIC,
Everything Passes Off Very
Quietly During the
Election.
BOURBONS MAKE GAINS.
Johnston Chosen Governor and
the Legislature Also
Secured.
PCPULIST VOTES SCATTERING.
Republicans Do Not Take Much la*
tercs f , but the A. P. A Is
Not Asleep.
MONTGOMERY, Ala.. Aug. 3.-Re
ports from the State are to the effect that
everything passed off quietly. In many
localities a light Vote was polled. All the
black-belt counties have given round
Democratic majorities. The Democrats
have made heavy gains in a number of
white counties which have heretofore
given Populist majorities, and also gained
a number of representatives in the Legis-
â¢ Jnturc. It is impossible to give anything
like an estimate at present. The ticket is
a long one, containing not only State offi
cers, but legislative members and county
officers. The indications now point to a
Democratic victory in the State and both
branches of the Legislature.
MOBILE, Ala., Aug. 3.â The election
in this city and county (Mobile), so far as
heard from, passed off very quietly. The
weather was conducive to the polling of a
large vote, the day being clear and warm
with a fine Gulf breeze to temper the heat.
Present indications are, however, that the
vote in the city at least has been light.
The total registration in April last was
something over 7000. This will bo a good
majority for Johnston and thrState Demo
cratic ticket. The Republicans did not
take much interest in the election and
what votes the Populist ticket got were
scattering, for they have no organization
in this county. Late to-night it may be
possible to give figures.
Returns received up to midnight for
four wards and eight precincts in Mobile
County give Johnston 1024 majority. The
vote cf four of tbe eight wards in the city
shows that there 'is about 53 per cent of
the total registration cast ia the vote
to-day.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Aug. 3.â Returns
received by the State Herald Up to 2
o'clock this morning indicate the election
of Captain Johnston by a majority of
40,000 to 45,000. The Legislature is safely
Democratic. In this (Jefferson) county
the A. P. A. maile a vigorous fight upon
Hon. Frank P. O'Brien, the Democratic
nominee for SherifT, but it is estimated
that he will have 300 majority. Tbe elec
tion throughout the State was orderly.
COAST MILITARY GOSSIP
Target Practice for Artillerymen
Under a New and Import
ant Method.
Commodore George Dewey Regarded
as Rear-Aimiral Beardslee's
Successor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 3. -The
artillery force stationed on the Pacific
Coast is to have heavy target practice un
der the new and important method just
adopted for the army. The method is set
forth in a circular now being prepared at
army headquarters, which will be issued
to the service within a week. The circular
is drafted from the report of the board of
officers assembled some months ago at
Fort Monroe, by order of Secretary La*
mont, to devise a new system of target
practice for the artillery arm. When its
renort was received copies were sent to ail
officers commanding artillery regiments
and to several general officers for criticism.
Their indorsement was considered by Gen
eral Miles, and some of the changes sug
gested were adopted.
The general scheme of proposed practice
is very comprehensive. There is to be
the usual annual instruction and it is to
be followed by three successive competi
tionsâfirst, the battery competition; sec
ond, regimental competition, and third,
general artillery competition. A board of
regimental officers is to be appointed for
instance, by Colonel W. M. Graham, who
commands tbe Fifth Artillery at the Pre
sidio, which shall examine in gunnery
the men recommended for examination
by the captains of batteries. Upon con
clusion of the examination competitors
will be arranged into three classes and
are to receive suitable insignias. Heavy
artillery practice is to be held at such
posts as are garrisoned by heavy artillery.
.Practice will be held with such breech
loading siege and seacoast ordnance as
may be available, otherwise with 8-inch
Converted rifles.
In the regimental competition, which is
to be held every two years, those batteries
whicn shall have representation will un
dergo an examination by a board of two
officers, designated by the department
commander. The exercise will Consist ol
service of the piece, mechanical maneu
vers and competitive firing. The battery
of the winning detachment at the compe
tition will carry at all parades and other
occasions a "prize guidon."
The general competition is to occur at
such time and place as tne commanding
general may designate, and may be par
ticipated in by the detachments represent
iiia all regiments. Prizes are to be awarded
to the victorious detachment and its regi
ment is to be awarded a trophy of value
and device to be decided upon in future. â â¢
It is expected by the department offi
cials that great increase in efficiency in
artillery firing will follow tbe practice of
the new system in artillery.
Although the tour of duty of Rear
Admiral L. A. Beardslee, In command of
the Pacific station, will expire this month,
It iÂ« understood that Secretary Herbert
will not relieve him until fall. This in
tention of the Seoretary is due to his idea
to have the Pacific squadron exercise in
fleet maneuvers under direction of an
officer with whom his subordinates are
acquainted.
Before the Secretary's departure for
Alabama the question was raised as to the
date when Rear Admiral Beardslee should
be relieved, and he decided that no orders
should be issued until the close of the
fleet maneuvers. The decision of the
Secretary is not generally known, and In
naval cucles where it in known that
Admiral Beardslee's tour of duty will
shortly expire, considerable gossip ia in
circulation as to his successor. As in all
gossip connected with squadron com
munds the name of Rear Admiral Ram
say, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, i 3
mentioned, but it can be safely asserted
that ihis official will not leave his present
post.
CommoJore John A. Howell made ap
plication to the department for assign
ment to duty as Rear- Admiral Beardslee's
reaef, hut this officer iias been assigned to
the command of the League Island Nnvy
yard, and it is extremely doubtful if he
wouJd care for a transfer. Commodore
George Dcwey iÂ« also an applicant for the
assignment, anl the general impression at
the depar;ment seems to be tliat he will
be given the billet. Commodore Dewey is
now president of the board of inspection
and surrey.
By direction of the Acting Sficretary of
War, Post Chaplain John S. Siebold,
United States army, i 3 relieved from duty
at Jefferson barracks, Missouri, and will
report In person to the commanding
officer at Fort Can by, Wasuington, for
duty at that post, ami by letter to the
commanding general of the Department
of the Columbia.

FIRMS IN SAUSALITO.
Two Itieetlinga on the Xorth Side De
atroyed by an Early Mornina Blaze.
SAUSALITO, Cal., Aug. 3.â Fire broke
out at 2 o'clock this morning in the house
of Henry de Souza in North Sausalito, l
just oaok. of tbe town jail. It quickly j
spread to the home of Joseph Frates
standing alongside. Citizens of Sausalito
were brought out of their bed^ by the
blasts from a locomotive in the depot
yard and tbe Fire Department was
quicKly on the scene. Nothing could be
done, however, to save the buildings i
owing to the incK of water, and some ;
rather hard criticism of the town authori
ties has been indulged in. The buildings,
insured for about $2000, were completely
destroyed. The fire is supposed to be of ,
incendiary origin.

aged 19, was stiot and killed by Amos
Decker, aged 18, in this city this evening,
and a large posse of officers and excited
citizens are pursuing the murderer, who
escaped to the country on a horse. Decker
and Miles were rivals, for the band of a

was very bitter. They came' to blows to

Decker then went home, and securing a

Leading Democrats of Los
Angeles Declare for
McKinley.
WILL WORK TO DEFEAT
BYRAN.
Believe That the Election of the
Nebraskan Would Be a
Calamity.
SOUND BUSINESS MEN GIVE
THEIR VIEWS.
Are Against a Third Ticket Because
It Would Divide the Gold
Forces.
Los Angeles Office of The Call, )
328 South Broadway, V
Los Angeles, Cal., Aug. 3.)
There is no doubt that a majority
of the business men of Los Ange
les who have heretofore voted the
Democratic ticket will not do so this
year. Many are outspoktn in their
support of McKinley and Hobart, but
there are others who ior personal reasons
are saying little about their disaffection
from the Chicago nominees and platform.
As one of the malcontents remarked to
day:
"There is many a self-respecting Demo
crat who is not proclaiming from the
housetops that he is going to vote for Mc-
Kinley, but when November 3 comes he
will put his little joker into the ballot-box
in the shape that will do the most good.
In other words his X will be stamped after
the names of the McKinley electors. I'll
vote and work for the Republican stand
ard-bearers, much as I dislike to do such a
thing, but I believe it is the only honor
able thing to do under the circum
stances."
Such in substance is the refrain of about
every other Democrat of prominence that
one sounds on the question. There are
others who are not so timid about giving
publicity to their sentiments, and speak
their minds freely to all men. Take Colonel
John E. Plater for instance. Colonel
Plater is a banker and capitalist. He is a
Southern man and served with distinction
in the Confederate army. He has been a
life-long Democrat, but when asked as to
his views on the political situation in this
year of Democratic disgrace, he said:
"You can say emphatically that I am an
uncompromising McKinley man. I don ? t
see that there is any use of saying more.
That's enough."
The manner in which Colonel Plater said
this left no room for doubt as to his earn
estness. He is a man of great influence in
the community, and will doubtless con
vert others to bia way of thinking and
voting. He is, in fact, quite active in
making McKinley voters.
C. A. Kenyon, manager of Bradstreet's
Commercial Agency, said: "Count me
among the McKinleyites, although I
never voted for a Republican candidate
for President in xny life. I have, in fact,
been a free-trade Democrat, and still
cling to the traditions of my party, but I
cannot support such a platform as was
formulated at Chicago. The attitude of
the two old parties has been reversed, and
I find the Republican platform more
nearly representing my principles than
that of the so-called Democracy. There
fore, I feel that it is my duty to vote for
the Republican standard-bearers. My po
sition keeps me in close touch with the
business men of this city, and I rind that
many who have been Democrats hereto
fore will vote tbe Republican ticket this
year. There is no question in my mind
that the business interests of the country
will suffer if Bryan is elected, but I have
no fear that he will enter the White
House."
Herman W. Hellman, president of the
Farmers' and Merchants' Bank, and
brother of I. W. Hellman of the Nevada
Bank, said : "I think it is safe to say that
a great many of the best Democrats in Los
Angeles County will vote for McKinley,
not because they have ceased to be Demo
crats, but because the Democratic party
has no nominee for President. Ido not
count Bryan as representing the party.
Many of us will be forced to vote for the
head of the Republican ticket, but for
other offices we will continue to vote for
the Democratic nominees, provided they
are good and capable men and represent
true Democratic principles."
Edward Germain, president of the
Southern California Wine Company, and
brother of Eugene Germain, American
Consul at Zurich, Switzerland, said : "1 am
not a free-silver Democrat and therefore
cannot vote for Mr. Bryan. There seems
to be but one alternative; that is to vote
for McKinley."
J. M. Elliott, president of the First Na
tional Bank said: "I do not liKe to say
anything about the money question, for
the simple reason that we bankers are al-"
ways being accused of trying to work poli
tics for our own exclusive benefit. Many
people, especially workingmen, think they
ought to oppose anything that we bankers
favor. I greatly deprecate that any such
class feeling should exist, because we are
all fellow-toilers in a sense and it is not true
that banK< rs are different from the rest of
the human race? But what is the use of
talking about that. It is enough to say
that I am a sound-money Democrat and
therefore not in sympathy with the Chi
cago platform. I have not said that I will
vote for Major McKinley, but I cannot
support Mr. Bryan, and the real Demo
crats have not yet nominated a candi
date."
W. 8. Devan, capitalist: "I am a Demo
crat, but solid for McKinley. I think the
saivation of the country depends upon his
election."
Leopold Winter, president of the South
ern California Cracker Company : "I am
a Democrat but cannot support the ticket
nominated at Chicago. Oar business
would suffer if the Chicago platform went
into effect, so I hope to see it defeated. I
do not believe Populist support will help
Bryan. Success for him would mean dis
aster to the business interests of the
country."
Shirley V. Martin, time-keeper for the
Cudahy Packing Company, is a young
Democrat who is wise before his gener
ation. Mr. Martin is a very intelligent,
energetic young man who reads and thinks
for himself, baid he to The Call inter-
viewer:
"I was born and bred a Democrat if ever
there was one. I am a native of Kentucky,
which has always been regarded the hot
bed of Democracy. Both of my grand
fathers were slave-holders, and my father
fought for the Confederacy. With such
an ancestry how could I be anything but
a Democrat of the Simon-pure variety?
But I am sorry to say that I cannot vote
for the Kind of Democracy we have this
year. Tne election of Bryan, according to
my notion, would be the worst thing tliat
could happen to the country. I shall vote
for McKinley, if I vote at all, much as I
clisliKe to vote the Republican ticket. I
hope the gold Democrats will not put a
ticket in the field, as it could not hope to
succeed and would only jeopardize Mc-
Kinley's chances. It is "every true Demo
crat's duty, in my opinion, to* support Mc-
Kinley either directly or indirectly by
not going to the polls." I believe there are
thousands of Democrats all over the coun
try who feel just as I do about this mat
ter."
Ex-Sheriff James C. Kaysâ l have not
told any one yet how I shail vote. lam a
Democrat and have always been a silver
man, but I put my country's honor above
everything else.
Henry S. Baer, president of the Los An
geles Wine Company â I have been a life
long Democrat and am a Democrat still,
but as the old saying soes. "You can lead
a horse to water, but you can't make
him drink.' 1 Altgeld and Tillman can't j
force me to vote lor their candidate. The
Chicago platform does not voice the De
mocracy of Jefferson or of Cleveland, and
I shall "not follow it- I have three broth
ers, and all of us have voted the Demo
cratic ticket all our lives, but we shall not
do so this year. We have "flopped," and
every one of us will vote for McKinley. I
hate to do so, but between two evils I will
choose the less.
Heury Vander Leek, manager of the
Ducominun hardware-storeâ W hile I am
a Democrat I believe that the action of the
Chicago convention is opposed to the
principles of tbe Democratic party. 1 have
not lett the party, but tne party has left
me. I tnink the best and easiest way to
defeat Bryan is to vote for McKinley. I
have never voted for any but a Democrat
for President, but this year I shall vote for
the Republican nominee.
E. P. Tresslar, photographerâ l am a
sound-money Democrat and as such am
opposed to the platform of the Chicago j
convention. I shail vote for McKinley, for j
I believe he offers the only salvation for â 
the country. Our foreign obligations must
be met and there is but one way to do it.
I am in favor of paying our honest debts I
honestly. I have voted the Democratic
ticket for twenty-five years, but I shall
not do so this fall. Tbe platiorm of the
Chicago convention is not a fair statement
of Democratic principles. 1 should be
sorry to see the sound-money Democrats
put up another ticket, for I believe that
our only hope is to concentrate upon Mc-
Kinley.
Isaac Norton, secretary of the Metropoli
tan Loan Association â I have always
been a Democrat, but 1 cannot accept the
Chicago platform. I am convinced that
sound money is our only safeguard. If
the silver men win in November I believe
we will have the greatest panic the coun
try has ever known. Wages will be the
first thing to suffer and the last to recover.
I shall vote for the sound money candi
date.
L. Sutor, manager for J. R. Newberry &
Co., wholesale and retail grocers â I am a
sound money Democrat, and certainly
shall not vote for free silver. I have al
ways voted the straight Democratic ticket
in National politics, but 1 cannot do so
this year. Ido not like McKinley, but I
prefer him to Bryan. The money ques
tion is of paramount importance in this
campaign.
M.' L.Graff, attorney for the Board of
Tradeâ l am a Democrat and a believer in
the principles of Democracy enunciated
by Grover Cleveland on questions of
finance, tariff and the administration of
public affairs. By reason of these convic
i tions I feel it my duty to vote for the Re
j publican nominee for President. 1 shall
do it for the reason that the agitation by
the Silver party has driven out of the
channels ot trade, as a circulating
medium, a large portion of the drafts,
bills of exchange and other evidences of
credit, by means of which the largest por
tion of the commerce of the world is at
present conducted. In my opinion such
destruction of confidence has brought
about a larger contraction of the circulat
ing medium than the entire value of the
silver mines of the country. For another ;
reason I believe that any law which per-
I mits the owner of a silver mine to have \
stamped upon his product the credit of
the Government, so as to increase its
value, and at the same time denying to
owners ot other products the same right,
is manifestly unjust and contrary to the
spirit of good government. I consider the
money question paramount to every other
political issue.
Judge Enoch Knight, Receiver of Pub
lic Moneys for the District of Southern
California, stated his attitude tersely as
follows: "I do not intend to support
either the ticket or the platform of the
Chicago convention."
These are but a lew expressions of opin
ion by Democrats who oppose Bryan.
There are hundreds here who would' say
the same.
DECLARES FOR McKINLEY.
Democratic Judge JBurke of Seattle
Oppotes a Third Ticket.
SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. 3. â Hon.
Thomas Burke, Washington's delegate to
the conference of sound-money Democrats,
to be held at Indianapolis on August 7 to
determine whether or not to place a Na
tional ticket in the field, having on Satur
day forwarded his proxy to General Ed
ward S. Bragg, in a subsequent letter of
this date expresses his personal views in
part as follows:
I regard the defeat of the Chicago platform
and its candidates as of more importance to
the welfare ot the country than the preserva
tion ior this campaign of party interests or
ptrty name. The position taken by Bourke
Cockran commends itself to my judgment.
This course would give a rallying point around
which Democrat* after election can gather,
and at the same time would enable sound- ;
money Democrats to cast their votes in such a |
way as to make them most effective. Ido not
believe we can at this time serve our country
and our party by firinjr Into the air. We
should be in a position to cast our ballots so as
to insure the defeat of the combined forces of
misrule and disorder represented by the Chi
cago and the St. Louis Popullstic platforms. I
do not believe that a third ticket will best pro
mote this end. We need the full, undivided
strength of sound-money men of both parties
concentrated in favor of McKinley.
Judge Burke is a Territorial ex-Chiefi
Justice and one of the ablest lawyers in
the State.
B ARBAN AT GUER NEVILLE.
Opens the first District Campaign With
a Rousing Speech.
GUERNEVILLE, Cal., Aug. 3.â Judge
Barham, Congressman of the First Con
gressional District, delivered his opening
speech ot the campaign in this place at
Union Hall Saturday night. He arrived
on the evening train in company with a
party of prominent Santa Rosa Republi
cans. Tbe train was met by the Guerne
ville brass band and the distinguished
party was escorted to tbe Grand Central
Hotel.
The evening meeting was most enthusi
astic and for two hours the speakers held
the undivided attention of their audience.
The hall was packed, farmers and wood
men coming even from beyond Cazadero,
ten miles distant over tbe mountains.
D. E. McKinley of Santa Rosa spoke
first. He is an orator of ability, and for
over two years he has advocated free silver
from a non-partisan standpoint. In his
speech last night he told why all patriotic
friends of the rfhite metal should vote the
Republican ticket. He dwelt on tbe his
torical causes which have brought about
the present financial system throughout
Europe. He said the price of silver, like
tv price of every other commodity, was
regulated by law and demand, and not
until the ten great nations of Europe went
back to a bimetallic basis could the price
of silver be forced tosl 29 per ounce, where
It must be in oruer tuat a silver dollar be
of equal value to one of gold.
The speaker bade his hearers beware of
Democratic promises, recalling the days
when they were told of the blessings of
"tariff reform,"' which baa proved an
utter failure. He compared tbe two
standard-bearers. One, another great un
known, but, like the late hero, Grover
Cleveland, "a man of destiny." On the j

other hand stood a soldier and a states
manâa man not of destiny, but of history.
When Congressman Barham came for
ward he was cheered to the echo. He said
that be had but one political ambition,
viz. : to serve his constituents faithfully
and well. His record would show for it
self how far he had been successful. He
dwelt with earnestness on the tariff and
silver questions, declaring himself the
stanch friend of silver, having in its inter
est voted independent of party in the
past. He stood ever ready to advance its
cause in the future. ;
Another question: of equal importance
to tariff or silver, he said, was the con
struction of the ;NicarÂ»2uan canal, the
great ocean highway , which would make
the United States -the commercial center
of the world. He spoke of the importance
of cheap transportation and of our great
waterways, which alone could make us ab
solutely independent of the grasping rail
way corporations. The long tight for the
present canal bill was reviewed, and the
Congressman promised to continue his
greatest efforts in its behalf. -
Representative Barham's speech was
frequently interrupted by applause or by
peals of laughter at his many witty
thrusts at our "friends on the other side
of the political fence."
O. O. Webber stated that the prime ob
ject of the meeting was to form a Guerne
ville Republican club. One hundred names
were signed to the roll at once. Owing to
the lateness of the hour no organization
was effected, and with rousing cheers the
meeting adjourned.

CAPITAL CITY POLITICS.
Daroux and Rider Dethroned by the Re
publican Central Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Aug. 3.â The
action taken at the meeting of the Repub
lican Central Committee in this city to
night bids fair to be the precursor of ruc
tions in the ranks of the party locally, and
the coming county convention, which will
be held on the 10th instant, will either be
a cut-and-dried proposition or a battle
field, depending, of course, upon the out
come at the primaries on Saturday of this
weeK.
For some time past the leaders in the
uptown wards who, it is claimed, are de
voted 10 railroad interests, have become
dissatisfied with Frank Daroux. For
many years Daroux has held almost un
disputed sway in the Second Wara. Dur- |
ing the past wees negotiations have been
pending, which culminated in the open
declaration of war. Daroux was given the
"cold shoulder," and the Little Napoleon,
Frank Rhodes, again rose to his former
pedestal.
This was accomplished by the adoption
of a resolution to the effect that all judges
and inspectors of primaries throughout
the city were to be appointed by the com
mittee as a whole, instead of following the
practice of former years, when each com
mitteeman named the primary officers in
his own ward, and by naming his warmest
' adherents was always enabled to retain
] his place on the committee.
When the resolution was put to a vote
it was carried by 9 to 2, Frank Daroux and
George Rider, who, it is claimed, aspire to
capture tne pennant so long borne by
Frank Rnodes in the First Ward, being
i against the measure.
As soon as the resolution was declared
I adopted the officers proposed by Rider |
I and Daroux in the First and Second
! wards were rejected and warm adherents
! of Rhodes were named in the First, while
! in the Second a list of the adherents of
; Tim Finn were accepted, the latter being
! in line with the majority.
By this action it was believed that
. Rider and Daroux, in view of the long
I odds against them, would throw up the
' sponge and sinK again into private life,
but this they decline to do. Instead, ti.ey
will put up an opposition ticket at the
primaries and endeavor to hold their
ground, which will insure warm work at
the polls.
Besides passing this particular resolu
tion the committee voted down every
resolution introduced by Daroux and
j Rider, and in this way curtailed their
' political ammunition. In speaking of the
â  action of the committee to-night Frank
Daroux said:
"This is the most villainous move ever
! made in politics in tniscity. Why.thatup
| town 'push' are all for the rail-
I road, and tdey mean to capture our
j wart's by foul means. I introduced
resolutions to-night that at all polling
places the ballot-box should be kept in
open sight; that all voters at primaries
j should be registered ; that in precincts
! where there was opposition both sides be
represented on the election board, and
j that only good citizens be permitted to en
ter the polling places and watch the vote.
All of these were rejected, and you can
quote me as saying that gigantic fraud is
intended."
The convention will probably consist of
250 delegates, and it is a foregone conclu
sion that Grove L. Johnson will receive
the nomination for Congress and Jud
Brusie for State Senator. If things work
as expected Scott Kunis will be named a3
Assemblyman from the Twenty-first,
William Sims from the Twentieth and
William Lovdali from the Twenty-second
District.
There are numerous candidates for the
position of Superior Judge, the most
prominent being A. B. Catiin, Charles
Oatman. J. B. Devine, Charles Post and
E. U. Hart, but it is whispered that
i George Eagan, who is seemingly the most
! active of the committeemen, favors
j Devine, Post or Catiin. As yet the super
i visorial candidates are in the shade, the
i aspirants largely depending for success on
the outcome of leaser battles among com
mitteemen.

TRAGIC DEATH
HEAR SAN JOSE,
George Curtin Killed at
His Father's Country
Place.
SUICIDE OB ACCIDENT 1
Asks for His Shotgun and Its
Report Is Heard Soon
Afterward.
BRAINED BY THE DISCHARGE.
The Theory of Self-Destruction Is
Not Credited by the Youth's
Relatives.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 3.â George Cur
tin, the 20-year-old son of C. C. Curtin, a
prominent and wealthy dry-goods man of
San Francisco, met a tragic death on the
ranch of his father, near this city, at 1
o'clock this afternoon. His lifeless. body
was found in a small granary on the place
by his mother, who was attracted by the
report of a gun. A charge of shot had
torn through his skull, causing instant
death. Circumstances indicate that the
young man committed suicide, but this
idea is scouted by his relatives, who be
lieve he was the victim of an accident.
The young man came to this city about
three weeks ago and went to live on his
father's place, which is called the Del
Coronado ranch and is situated on Capital
avenue, about a half mile off the Alum
Rock road. He was joined a week later
by his mother and sister, Mis 3 Lizzie Cur
tin, who were upon the place at the time
of his sad death. The father visited his
ranch on Saturday evenings and returned
to San Francisco on Monday mornings.
Yesterday morning young Curtin brought
his father to San Jose to board the train.
He returned to his home about 12:30
o'clock, and, after turning the horse and
buggy over to a hired man, went into a
small granary near tbe dwelling. His
mother came out and called to him to
come to his lunch, telling him it had
been waiting for some time. He replied:
"All right; I will be in in a few mo
ments."
This was the last time Mrs. Curtin saw
her son alive. A few moments later he
asked a hired man upon the place to bring
his shoteun, as there were squirrels about
the barn which he wanted to kill before
going in to lunch. The hired man brought
the gun, delivered it to its owner and left
to attend to duties in the Btable.
Soon the report of the gun attracted
Mrs. Curtin and the hired man to the
granary. They found the young man's
corpse on the floor, a charge of shot hay
ing carried away the upper portion of his
skull.
Inserted in the trigger- guard of the shot
gun was a file, fastened to a piece of hose.
This gave rise to the suicide theory, as it
appeared that Curtin had placed the muz
zle of the weapon against his head ana
pressed the file with his toes.
Relatives of the young man are loth to
accept this theory. They believe that he
was tinkering with the gun in some man
ner, and that it was accidentally dis
charged. They express utter ignorance of
any cause which might have lea the
young man to take his life.- The hired
man says that young Curtin seemed to be
in his usual good humor when he asked
him to bring the shotgun. The father of
the young man, who owns a large dry
goods store on Market street, near Fifth,
in San Francisco, was telegraphed for and
arrived in this city this evening.
George Curtin was a graduate ot St.
Mary's College in Oakland. Since leaving
school he bas been employed chiefly as a
floor-walker in his father's store. He was
of good habits, industrious and unusually
bright and success f ul in business affairs.
He was always well liked by those who
came in contact with him. In his school
days it was noted that he was sometimes
oversensitive over trivial matters.
The three daughters in th<s family are
highly esteemed in society in San Fran
cisco. The family was so shocked at the
sad and entirely unexpected occurrence
that they could scarcely realize what had
happened. All declare that the boy had
been unusually good-spirited during the
past week. He never exhibited any fits of
despondency. The young man had every
thing to live for, his father being a very
wealthy man and he was the favorite of
the family.
HOLD-UP NEAR FRESNO.
Masked Men Halt Two Vineyard Employes
and Appropriate Part of Their
Wealth.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 3.â A. A. Green
and Harold Latter, employes at the Eisen
vineyard, were leld up by two masked
robbers rive miles east of this city about
11:30 o'clock last night. Green and Latter
were in a carriage, and were returning
from a visit to the city. When at a point
near Denicke's fig ranch the robbers
sprang from the ditches at either side of
the road. They were masked and, level
ing revolvers at the men in the carriage,
commanded them to stop.
Neither Green nor Latter were armed,
and they were taken so completely by sur
prise that they could do nothing but obey.
They were ordered to get out upon the
road and hold up their hands. "In the
darkness Green slipped his watch into his
hat and threw his purse to the side of the
highway, without being detected. Latter
was too near one of the robbers to save
any valuables. Both men were searched
by the robbers. Nothing was secured from
Green, but Latter lost a $50-watch and $3
in cash.
The robbers then marched the two men
up the road for a distance of a quarter of
a mile. They instructed Green and .Latter
to proceed eastward. The road agents
then went back and took the horse and
carriage, in which they drove to this city.
At 9 o'clock this morning the rig was
found on N street, the horse having been
turned loose.
SAN DIEGO INVESTIGATION.
Railroad Commissioners Find a Difference
of Opinion Regarding the Temecula
Canyon Line.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Aug. 3.â At a meeting
of the Railroad Commissioners to-day, the
opponents of the Santa Fe Railroad re
ceived a setback that practically ends the
case. Considerable testimony was intro
duced during the morning, intended to
s ow that the company had received a
subsidy of 10,000 acres of land on an agree
ment which it had not kept. Later a peti
tion from 150 business men was presented
asking the Commissioners to compel the
company to rebuild the Temecula Canyon
line, thus reopening the trade of that sec
tion to San Diego, or forfeit its franchise.
When the complainants had cited their
case the second witness for the railroad
brought out a set of resolutions that
changed the situation. The witness was
George W. Martson, a leading retail mer
chant of Southern California. He ap
peared as chairman of a committee of tÂ£e
Merchants' and Manufacturers' Associa
tion, which had adopted resolutions ex
pressing as the sense of the association
that a railroad through Temecula Canyon
was not necessary to the trade of San
Diego and that the railroad company
should not be compelled to maintain a
line through the canyon, which is subject
to floods, when a more feasible route may
be found. If the company will build as
near to the old road as procticable, so as
to develop the trade of the region, San
Diego merchants would be content.
This, coming from leading merchants
and shippers, has, it is believed, closed the
agitation.
TROCKEE'S WINTER CARNIVAL.
Preparations for tn Ire Palace Are*
Already Under Way.
TRUCKEE, Cal., Aug. 3.â Undaunted
by last season's financial failure the stock
holders in the ice palace are already
making preparations for the coming
winter. Both the ice palace and toboggan
slide wiil be run as heretofore and many
needed improvements are to be made.
Mountaineers prognosticate an unusually
cold winter. Should these prophecies be
fulfilled success is assured. "Tom" Whit
ney, a prominent Truckeeite and the prin
cipal projector of the ice palace scheme,
said to-day :
"finances cut no figure. The palace
goes as it did last season," and, pointing
to the frame work of the palace, he con
tinued: "If I am not mistaken a crystal
covering will enshroud those walls as
early as November next, and by the early
part of December ou palace will be in per
fect shape. Those who prophesied failure
for our project wiil be made to see their
mistake."
Truckeeites in general are sangnine of
the success of this particular project dur
ing the coming winter. Every indication
points to an unusually cold season.
TROCKEE'S NEW RAILWAY.
Penetrates a Fast Section Shaded by
Virgin Forest.
TRUCK EE, Cal., Aug. 3.â Truckee's
new railroad is progressing rapidly. The
grade has been completed and tracklayers
are now at work. Though only seven
miles in length, the road means much for
TrucKee. Starting from the center of
town it runs westward into a hitherto in
accessible chain of mountains, where an
excellent quality of pine lumber abounds,
the supply being practically inexhausti
ble.
Planing-mills and box-factories will be
erected at its terminal point, Katz Flat,
and a town almost the size of Truckee will
spring up within a few months. At least
200 men will be kept at work during the
lumber season, and this place will be bene
fited greatly.
The Sierra Nevada Wood and Lumber
Company is the projector of the road, and
plenty of money is behind it. Upward of
eighty five men are now engaged in con
struction.
WATER FOR SANTA ROSA
Inexhaustible Supply Gushing
Up From an Under
ground Flow.
Two Million Gallons a Day From
a New Well Sunk by
the City.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Aug. 3.â The per
plexing problem of an adequate water
supply for this city was to a great extent
solved Saturday afternoon. The new
water system, which cost the taxpayers
$165,000 outright, with a prospect of much
additional expense, had not proved to be
all that its supporters hoped for. The
eight wells would not give out sufficient
water for the city's needs. The big double
pump, with a capacity of 1,000,000 gallons
a day, was kept running day and night,
and the insufficient quantity thus obtained
was so charged with air from the powerful
pumps as to resemble San Francisco milk
before the first Dockerey raid. There was
a great deal of subdued uneasiness over
the situation, and the Council at length
determined to sink a huge well to tap, if
possible, the underground flow.
Late Saturday afternoon the ' long
looked-for water came with a rush, pure,
cold and sparkling. So rapidly did the
big well fill that the workmen were forced
to seek the surface or swim. The water
had reached the surface yesterday morn
ing in spite of the pump and an addi
tional pump was placed into position.
Another is now being attached, giving tbe
system a capacity of 2,000,000 gallons per
day, and a thorough test of the new flow
will be made during the coming dry sea
son. If, as the promoters believe, the
supply comes from the Sierras it will
prove inexhaustible and will be the great
est boon ever visited upon Santa Rosa.
FATAL FIRE AT ASTORIA,
Musician Navoni Is Suffocated
While Trying to Save
His Violin.
Was the First Leader of the Tivoli
Opera-House Orchestra in San
Francisco.
ASTORIA, Or., Aug. 3. â Professor
John Morrisey Navoni, a musician, was
suffocated during the progress of a blaze
in an Astor-street building at an early
hour this morning. Navoni roomed in
the upper portion of the house, and made
an attempt to reach his room to save his
violin. He was overcome by the smoke,
but during the excitement was not
missed, and it was not until the rooms
were being examined by the firemen that
his body was found.
Navoni came to this city from Portland
about four years ago and bas officiated as
orchestral leader in various places. Dur
ing the last few months he had devoted
his time to teaching, and when oppor
tunity offered played at entertainments.
Navoni was born in New York in 1846.
He was tie son of an Italian musician of
note. In his early life be was a violinist
in many Eastern theatrical and operatic
orchestras. He went to San Francisco
about fifteen years ago and remained there
for a number of years, being the first
orchestra leader in the Tivoli Opera-house.
His father was an intimate friend of John
Morristey, the pugilist statesman, and
it was alter the latter that the musician
was named. He was married, but owing
to his dissipated habits in former years
be became estranged from his wife and
family. He was practically without
means, but his remains will be given
burial by his fellow-musicians of this city,
among whom he was popular both be
cause of his skill as a violinist and his
genial nature. Â»

The investigation into the affairs of the
Whittier State School is beginning to
show results. At a late meeting of the
board of trustees the resignation of Miss

MUNDER BY ARSON.
One Life Lott in a Fire of Alleged Ineen-
diary Origin.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 3.â Max !
Meyers is in the City Jail, charged with
arson, as the result of a fire which oc
curred at First and Los Angeles streets
this morning and caused tbe loss of one
life. Meyers kept a second-hand clothing |
store in a row of one-story buildiugs j
owned by J. A. Builard, Three men, pass
ing his place at an early hour this morn
iner, allege that they saw Meyers throw a
lighted match onto some paper under a
gasoline store at the rear of his store,
after which he hurried into the street.
The gasoline was evidently turned on, for j
almost instantly there was an explosion ,
and the building was in flames.
The tire spread rapidly to a Chinese I
washhouse adjoining and J. B. Hunter's !
cigar-stand on the corner. A number of |
Chinese laundrymen, who were at work i
when the fire broke out, barely had time

OIL SUPPLY DIMINISHED.
Well-Owner* Cannot Provide Enough for
Local Comutnptiov.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 3.â The ex
ecutive committee of the Oil Exchange of
this city, at its meeting to-day, decided to
move the headquarters of the exchange to
426 Bryne block, where the office of the
American Oil Company is located. Secre
tary Strasbury of the exchange said this
afternoon :
"I hate very much to admit it, but the
fact is that it is only the question of a few
weeks when the oil industry of Los An
geles will be a thing of the past. The
American Oil Company has just sunk a
new welJ, and the production is only about
eight barrels. For the last four months
the supply has been 40,000 barrels short of
the consumption. This is an average of
10,000 barrels monthly. It will not be
long until the furnaces here are again
consuming coal."
CAUSED A CHILD'S HEATH.
Manslaughter Charge Filed- Against a
Thirteen- tear- Old Boy.
LOS ANGELES, Cfcl., Auk. 3.â A re
markable charge has been filed against
13 year-old Willie Challis, who, while
"playing fire engine" with a tricycle
lighted with a gasoline lamp, caused the
death of little Roy Harell as the result of
an explosion. Just how young Challis is
guilty of manslaughter does not appear,
but that is the charge against him, and he
will probably be committed to Whittier
for 'his rashness in playing with an ex
plosive in company with a boy smaller
than himself. â

raised from 116,250,000 to $16,973,334, an
increase of $323,334, and despite the

WAGES FOR TYPESETTERS
Governor Budd Inquires Into
State Printing Olfice
Methods.
Demands the Appointment of an Ex
pert to Audit Books and
Bills.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Ang. 3.â ln re
sponse to a message, State Printer John
son appeared before the State Board of
Examiners to-day and was questioned by
Governor Budd, who declares it to be his
intention to make a thorough examina
tion into the methods employed in con
ducting the birthplace of school book* and
official State document*. State Printer
Johnson declares that investigation can
not take place any too soon or bÂ« con
ducted in any too searching a manner to
suit him. The first question to which the
Governor required an answer was:
"How comes it that the board received
a claim for a foreman's salary when the
entire plant was closed?"
Mr. Johnson said that the office was never
entirely closed, some of the men wonting
right along, and in a few cases where men
had worked heavy overtime under press
of work it was customary to allow them
wages during a vacation to reimburse
them. Governor Budd then stated that
he desired an expert appointed to go over
the bills of the office, and to perform that
duty he favored Mr. Harrison. He also
declared that he would sign no more bills
until they had been experted.
"Is it not a fact," asked Attorney-Gen
eral Fitzgerald, "that this matter has
been under investigation and that Secre
tary Markley has been approving these
I bills right along without objection, and
that no flaws have been pointed out to
me?"
"I wrote to you about it," retorted the
Governor, "and I also spoke about an ex
pert."
"But you did not tell me that you sus
pected anything or anybody," answered
the Attorney-General.
"It is the system I am afraid of," 6aid
the Governor, "not Mr. Johnson. He has
to rely upon the statement of his fore
men, who are not required to certify under
oath, and they may be deceiving him. I
claim that the printing should not cost
more than it would to have It done by out
side parties, and I want Mr. Harrison ap
pointed as expert. Now, here's the claim
of Mr. Funston. He has not been work
ing."
"Mr. Funston keeps check on the booK
binding employes," explained Mr. John
son. \ "He has been sick, but was allowed
his wa|;M.".i - ;; ' ' - 'â â â â '-
"Why? 'demanded Fitzgerald.
. "Because he worked overtime during the
session of the Legislature," answered Mr.
Johnson. : . . .
â¢ "Well, here are a list of eight employes
who have been paid for sixteen days while
the State printing office was closed," said
the Governor.
"Well, the practice of taking a vacation
is common in all civil offices," remarked
Fitzgerald.
"I don't care whether it is or not," re
torted , the Governor. "When a man
comes in and swears that services were
rendered on the dates and in the manner
named in the bill, when they were not, the
system should be revised, as much for Mr.
Johnson's protection as anything else. If
the State of California cannot, pay $50 to
have claims examined it cannot get me to
pass them, that's all." : - --s '*
"Well, I presume that .with these excep
tions the bills approved are all right;
are they not?" asked Fitzgerald.
"That's what I propose to find out,"
remarked Governor Budd. "Mr. Johnson
has a big office and I want it so regulated
that it will be impossible for his foremen
to deceive him should they so desire."
"Who Is this Harrison?" asked Fitz
gerald, turning to Johnson.
"He is an expert printer and a 'square'
man." answered Johnson.
"Has he any feeling against you or your
office?" . :
"Well, I believe he has a political feel
ing. He is a Democrat," said Johnson. .
"That's his misfortune," said Fitzger
ald. .
"And I think It's his glory," interrupted
the Governor. .
After considerable discussion on various
employes' claims Mr. Johnson said:
â¢ "If you prefer another system I will
gladly adopt it. My predecessors have
always used this one and, I am sure, to
good advantage. Some pieoework has to
be paid for double."
Then the Governor turned to Fitzgerald
and said: "We agreed to appoint an ex
pert and Mr Ely, who gave me the infor
mation that the office was closed for six
teen days, was three days later dis
charged."
"He was discharged for good cause," in
terrupted Johnson, "and has written reas
ons stating why he was discharged, and it
was for no such reason as you intimate."
"The reason you pave waa incorupe
tency," said the Governor, "and he is as
good a workman as thers is in the State."
"Mr. Rodgers, who gave him his dis
charge, will be glad to show you some of
the work he has done," said Johnson.
"I have known him for years," replied
the Governor. "He was a compositor in
the Stockton Mail office, and while I can't
help his discharge, I don't feel right that
it should be caused simply because he an
swered my questions."
"We asked the resignation of the former
printing expert," said Fitzgerald, "because
he bad nothing to do, What do you want
with another?"
"Yes; but since that time we have had
several cases before the board which
clearly demonstrated that there should be
an expert to pass on supplies for the print
ing office."
And then the matter wa* postponed till
to-morrow, as were the charges against trie
Yountville Boldiers' Home.
Swnubera Go** Frse.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. B.âGov
ernor Budd this morning denied the ap
plication for the requisition of C. 0. Swan
berjc, charged with perjury in the estate
of Louis Corriveau. The Governor held
that the complaint was insufficient and
that in his judgment there was no possi
bility of a conviction on the charge.
Chief Crowley wired to the police au
thorities at Chicago last evening that the
requisition had been refused and to re
lease Swanberg from custody.
Tyndall Pay* a Fine.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Aug. 3.â J. Mc-
Ivor Tyndall, the so-called, mind-reader,
was fined $5 in the Police Court to-day for
fast driving during one of his tests last
night. Tyndall pleaded guilty, but stated
that he was unconscious of wrongdoing,
as he was governed by the subjects with
whom he was experimenting.

LO, THE INDIAN,
AND HIS FRIENDS.
Annual Institute of Indian
Teachers in Session
Here.
DR. HAILMAN'S ADDRESS
Prominent Indian Educators
From All Over the
Country.
BABCCCK AND BLACK SPEAK.
The First Meeting of the Kind Ever
Held Hereâ lt Will Continue
Till Friday.
The third annual institute of teachers of
United States Indian schools and the first
session of the institute in San Francisco
opened Jast night in the assembly-room of
the Girls' High School at Geary and Scott
streets. A fair-sized audience displayed
much interest in the exercises, occasion
ally applauding the sentiments ottered by
the speakers.
E. E. L. Newbern, connected with the
4fuyallup Indian reservation school, near
Tacoma, Wash., stated that nearly every
Indian school and reservation vest of the
Rocky Mountains was represented either
in person by its teacher or by proxy In
some other teacher.
The main object of the institute is to
consider how to teach the Indian to be
civilized and how best to do it. In the
audience were a number of Indians, in
cluding three very intelligent young In
dian ladies.
Dr. R. E. L. Newbern officiated as chair
man of the evening. Among tue distin
guished visitors on the platform were:
Dr. W. N. Hailman of Washington, D. C,
general superintendent of United States
Indian Schools; the three United States
Indian Supervisors â Moss, Mead and
Rakestraw; Mrs. Nellie B. Eyster, presi
dent of the California Branch of the
Woman's National Indian Association;
State Superintendent of Instruction Black,
G. M. Irwin, Superintendent of Public In
struction of Oregon; Superintendent of
City Schools Madison Babcock.
Superintendent Babcock delivered the
address of welcome.
Stale Superintendent Blaok in his ad
dress said that thA whites obtained this
country not from England, but from the
aborigines. No work of the Government
was doing more for civilization and hu
manity than the Indian Department, and
he expressed a hearty welcome to the insti
tute in behalf of California, laying the
hearts of the peoplt of California are al
ways warm.
The response to the addresses of wel
come was made by Dr. Hailman. He said:
"The Indians are as much the wards of the
State as of the Great Fataer. I hope the
Indian wards will be taken out of the
hands of the Great Father and cared for
by the several States as soon aa possible.
"You know their need much better than
we. Bat still, as yet, we are strangers in
the land in which they were born. The
only way to teach them citizenship is to
teach them citizenship in practice. We
are trying to teach our Indians under con
ditions that do not promote rinlization.
His bravery, his courage are unquestioned ;
his devotion to duty is a lesson to each
one of us. His heart is as tender as ours.
We can learn much from the Indian in
thinsrs great. To civilize them in dress is
not enough; we must civilize them from
within."
Hon. J. M. Irwin, State Superintendent
of Public Instruction of Oregon, said in
his address:
"This is one of the most important
questions that confronts us. Thirty years
aeo it was found necessary to surround
the Indian with a certain kind of environ-
ment â a military environment. Now the
question is not so much how to protect
the white man, but to give the Indian
the advantages of the white man;
how to make a citizen of him. The United
States in order to preserve its existence
must educate its people and moralize its
people. The United States in general and
eacn State in particular should bear in
mind those two things.
â¢â¢It is the duty of this Government to
absorb the body of red men on this coast
and make them a part of us, instead of
surrounding them with the environment
of tbe Government. We have legislated
as though they were a foreign people and
not as a people that belong to us. The
red man has a right to go to a saloon and
get as drunk as a wbite man, but he has
no right to citizenship 1 I hare seen black
face?, yellow faces and white faces in
school in Portland, but I never saw there
a red face. The red boys are as capable to
learn as tbe yellow, black and many white
faces. Why not admit them to our pub
lic schools?"
This concluded tne speech- making. This
morning at 9 o'clock and this afternoon at
HEW TO-DAY.

There has been widespread interest in
Thk Call's recent exposure of the free
trade fallacies of Democracy, and of
"William Jennings Bryan in particular.
On the Wool Exchange a few days ago
every dealer but one in a company of
nearly a hundred representative business
men indorsed The Call's articles showing
that CleveSandism has killed the sheep
growing interests of America. There is
equal interest in the present series of
articles on lumber, which show what a
blight bas followed in the path of Bryan
ism as applied to the lumber industry.
Those who have been interested in
studying the disaster and general ruin
wrought by free trade in the wool and
lumber industries of the United States,
and particularly on the Pacific Coast, will
be pleased to read further on the subject
and study the history of the destruction of
the lumber industry more in detail than
appeared in the first article on the subject,
was published in yesterday's Call.
1 1 was the immortal Lord Bacon, founder
of tne inductive method of reasoning, who
first taugnt the world to reserve conclu
sions until a thorough examination of
facts. The student of the times, the man
anxious to know why things are as they
are, should keep clear of the dreamy rhet
oric of Bryan and study the facts of every
day life. These facts are not to be found
in the mouthings of politicians and the
ravings of eccentric pamphleteers, but they
are in the reports made in cool blood by
men of affairs.
One of the strongest points in favor of
the position of McKinley and . the Repub
lican party as against the sophistries of
Democracy and Bryan was made by the
Pacific Pine Lumber Company of San
Francisco in a recent reply to the Com
mittee on Ways and Means of the United
States Senate, then engaged in inquiring
into the condition of various industries as
affected by the tariff. Among other things
the company said:
To the Honorable Ways and Means Committee
of the House of Representatives, Washington,
D. ('.âGentlemen-: The lumber trade of the
Pacific Coast engaged in the manufacture of
Douglas Fir (commonly termed Oregon pine),
6pruce and cedar lumber, noting per newspa
per publication and otherwise, the disposition
of your honorable committee to place lumber
OH the free list in the proposed modificution of
the tariff, view such possibility with the grav
en apprehension, and this company having
taken an active interest in this question in
ISBS, is requested to submit to your honorable
committee the condition?: of the lumber trade,
and the effect of such action, with especial re
gard to the situation on mis coast arm its re
lation to British Columbia, on the north.
In such direction it premises by assuming
that the only justification that can be alleged
for removing the duty on lumber is, either a
limited supply within the territory of the
United States (and accessible to its people), or
a possibility that the present standing timber
may, in holdings, be concentrated in the
hands of a few, with the effect of unfairly
raising the prices to the consumer. In refuta
tion of such allegations, it would respectfully
fcubmit that the most casual investigation will
determine the non-existence of the tirst as a
fact, or the second as a potentiality.
â  A fow years ago the first of the above-named
positions had emphasis from the very great in
roads made upon the standing timber of the
northern frontier of the United States, with
the coincident apprehension that the continu-

State Chairman Alford Names More
Committees and Ben Maddoz
for Secretary.
The General County Committee of the
Buckley Democracy held a big and a
warm meeting last evening, at which,
with unanimous enthusiasm, they de
nounced, kicked, roasted and otherwise
punished City and County Attorney Cres
well. Auditor Broderick and Treasurer
Block for their unnecessary action in
formally recognizing the Rainey faction
of tbe Democracyâ the Juutaâ as the reg
ular one.
As these officials are understood to be
candidates for the same offices for another
two years, tne hostility of the big end of
the Democracy tends to complicate their
chances.
This was the first of the regular weekly
meetings of the entire general committee,
which will occur on Monday evenings.
ThÂ« committee met in the large hall
attached to the attractive and quite, ex
tensive new headquarters of the organiza
tion at 20 and 24 Ellis street. Flags and
bunting liberally drape the hall.
There were 275 members present at roll
call and many more came in later as
Chairman Joseph Rothschild announced.
W. J. Fitzgerald offered a resolution
authorizing the chairman to appoint a
committee of seven "which shall have
lull power to act in the matter of fusing
with the People's party of fean Francisco
in the coining campaign,"
But the committee did not take kindly
to the idea of fusion with the Populists ih
tiie local campaign and it was headed orf
by Thomas Egan, who offered as a substi
tate a resolution denouncing the Election
Commissioners and calling for fusion in
tlie matter of getting a share of the elec
tion officers only. Egan's resolution was
as follows:
Whereas, Under the act through which they
hold a^ Election Commissioners, to wit, "An
ai t iÂ«. reguiate the registration of voters and
to secure the purity of elections in the City
and County of San Francisco." the following
language is used: "Section. 12. â¢ â¢ â¢ fro-
Tided, that in selecting election officers the
Commissioners shall take care to select as
nearly as possible an equal number of persons
of opposite political faith and opinion to serve
at each precinct," which we hereby declare
they have not done; for we are not unmindful
that in November, 1894, at the last general
election, 54,135 votes were cast for members
of Congress in the Fourth and Fifth Congres
sional districts in this City with the Demo
cratic, Republican, Prohibition and People's
party, as the regular organization under sec
tion' 1186 of the Political Code, and
that in said Congressional district in this
City the People's party polled 10,
-274, or one-fiftn of these votes, yet were

ance in the ratio then existing would very
soon leave the country without a source of
supply within its own borders. So wedded
was the main cousumiug class to the use of the
principal product of said section that for a
time no source of supply was deemed avail
able except that existing in Canada, contigu
ous thereto; hence a temporary leaning to
wards the abrogation of duty on white pine in
order that such supply might be available.
The trend of sentiment in that direction was,
however, of short life; the vast areas of yel
low pines in the Southern States attracted
marked attention, aud the liberal investment
of capital led to a phenomenal development of
the lumber industry in that section, supple
mented by so great an activity in the intro
duction of its products in the territory previ
ously the domain of white pine that to-day
the substitution is so fully accepted that any
reliance upon Canadian timber is absolutely
unnecessary, with the further certain effect
that should the same find entry to displace the
Southern product it would be a deathblow to
this industry that in the past five years has so
greatly eularged the taxable values of that sec
tion.
Additionally to the "entree" of the Southern
products of the Middle West of the United
States is a growing shipment trade by rail
from the Pacific Coast, increasing yearly and
to coutinue increasing hereafter, provided the
exclusion of the products of our Northern
neighbors is maintained and should the old
Northwest be entirely denuded of her timber
the new Northwest of the Pacific Coast jointly
with the Southern States from their vast areas
of virgin timoer (as aflirmed by the forestry
reports of the Interior Department) positively
guarantees for generations a full supply for
the Nation within its territorial limits.
The question of supply for the future being
so well established from said sources and as
suming that the same excess-producing
capacity exists in the Southern States in re
lation to consumption that is a condition on
the Pacific Coast (where such capacity is
nearly three times the consumption) the com
petition thereby engendered becomes a cer
tain assurance of low prices to consumers and
it is indeed difficult to imagine any grounds
whatsoever for opening the markets of the
United States to foreign lumber.
Thus far this presentation may be deemed as
applying to the country at large; there are,
however, conditions existing on this coast that
further appeal to the consideration of your
honorable committee. We refer to methods of
transportation and the advantages to the mill
owner in British Columbia growing out of
the protective tendencies of its Government.
The shipping ports ol British Columbia are
adjacent to those on the American side and
no farther distant from points ot consumption,
whether the shipments are by the way of the
Pacific Ocean to domestic coast ports or by
rail to the Eastern States. The American mill
owner ib by the laws of the Nation com
pelled to use in the coasting trade tonnage of
American register exclusively, while if our
domestic markets are opened to the mills of
British Columbia without restriction the own
ers on that side would have the choice of all
flags in their carriers, thus to all intents and
purposes interjecting foreign bottoms into tne

general" committee, a fair representation in the
registration boards to protect the just rights
01 the rank and file of Democracy and the
joint rights of all electors favoring the free
coinage of silver, the issue in the approaching
campaign, and we here deny the "Junta,"
with Messrs. Creswell, Broderick and Block,
I are now or ever have been true to the cause of
silver; therefore
Resolved, That we aenounce Messrs. Cres
well, Broderick and Block individually and as
Commissioners for their actions and express
regret that our work and votes were wasted in
placing such political sycophants in the offices
they disgraceâ false to their oaths of office and
false to their friends.
Whereas, Harry T. Creswell, William Brod
erick and James N. Block, the majority asid
Democratic members of the Board ot Election
Commissioners ot the City aud County 01 San
Francisco, be.ing the City and County Attor
ney, Auditor and Tax Collector respectively of
San Francisco, nominated and elected on the
Democratic ticket by and through the manage
ment and work of the General Committee 01 the
Democratic party, acting under our constitu
tion and by-laws and pursuant to the authority
confirmed to this regular General Committee
aud its predecessors underpaid constitution
by the ballot reform law of this State; and
whereas, said Creswell, Broderick and Block,
forgetful of tbeirduties to the authority which
created them and of the General Committee of
which they were members at the several
stages of the Democratic General Committee
existence under the printed constitution and
by-laws to which they respectively sub
scribed, having deserted their former friends
which through thi9 regular orpauization rep
resents 90 per cent ol the regular Democratic
votes in this City for a rump organization of
seceders called the "Junta" Democratic Com
mittee, and as its name implies "a select coun
cil of a few" conspiring and intriguing with
its smHil circle of outside goldbng manipula
tors to place in the hands of said conspirators
and their followers, which at most amounts to
but 10 per cent of the Democratic party of San
Francisco, the election machinery of the City
lor the purpose of carrying out their sinister
designs.
Resolved, That a committee of one from each
Assembly district be appointed by the chair to
confer with oil political parties -who favor the
free and unlimited coinage of silver in this
year of fusion, and with them devise some
feasible and just plan that will enable all
voters favoring free coinage of silver to protect
electors in the matter of precinct registration
of voters and secure the purity of elections
where rights are in danger, and that said com
mittee be and hereby is vested with plenary
powers in the premises.
T. J. Gallagher said the only word of
forbearance with the Election Commis
sioners that was uttered.
"We'il have all we can do to win witn
out making any further enemies," he said,
and he moved to table the denouncing
parts of the resolutions.
P. A. Dolan, who a] way has a shiilalab
ready, objected to striking out anything.
"I favor mentioning every old goldbug
and barnacle in the Junta. [Much ap
plause.] McNab, Pond and tnose fellows
are traiiors to the good old ship. I'm op
posed to fusing with the Populist 3, too,
and I movfi that a committee beappointed
to see if they are composed of A. P. A.' s
or what not."
W. F. Humphreys was one of several
who denounced tne Election Commis
sioners for turning their backs on those
who put them in office.
"When they see tit to cast their fortunes
with an organization hostile to us it is time
we ncterl on the defensive," he declared.
"If they slap us and we don't resent it we
onu'ht to close-up shop."
C. W. Pope said that they had turned
their backs on the men that "elected them
and they were no longer Democrats.
"bet us help our friends and damn our
enemies," said Pope
"The Democratic See Yups, or hatchet
men of the Juuta," said Fitzgerald, "are
saying that we can't get on the ticket.
Now by fusing with the Populists we can
get on the ballot sure and beat the-m five
to one."
The motion to strike out any denuncia
tion got 3 ayes and a tremendous roar of
noes, w.'.ich was followed by a cheer.
P. F. Dundon opposed iusion and then
Egan's resolutions were carrried as read,
as a substitute for Fitzgerald's.
M. J. Donovan, chairman of the execu
tive committee, reported that there would
be additional enrollment for the coming
primaries on the 13fh, 14th and 15th.
Smith of the Forty-first thought that
those big quarters were incomplete with
out a place to buy "soda water," but his
motion to provide "a little place" to buy
drinks was ruled out of order.
Mr. Humphreys got some applause by
reporting for the absent treasurer, Sam

coasting trade, though technically the voyage
is from a foreign port.
Analogous conditions exist in the relation of
the lumber manufacturers and shippers of
Maine to those of the provinces east of that
State, while the markets of the Middle West
and Eastern States, that the Pacific Coast man
ufacturers are now cultivating, would be di
vided with British Columbia, and the ship
ments to points closest to destination on the
Canadian border be made over a foreign rail
road, built and subsidized by foreign capital
(paralleling competing roads on the American
side), to the exclusion of traffic desired by and
due to the transcontinental roads in the United
States.
Again, the stimulation of the lumber indus
try on this coast is a great aid to the develop
ment of its merchant marine. During the de
pression in the shipbuilding industry in^other
part* of the United States such industry has
been fairly active on this coast, and its foster
ing is of more than local importance, inas
much as the majority of vessels of recent con
struction are carrying our flag to foreign ports,
where it has been hitherto almost unknown.
The effect of permitting foreign tonnage, built
and run at lower cost, to Invade the coasting
trade would be the same as upon American
deep-water shipping, now practically driven
from the seas, as also to effectually end as an
industry shipbuilding on this coast.
We most respectfully submit to your honor
able committee that the protective tendencies
of English governments to the north of us in
subsidizing railroads, steamship lines and
offering to industrial enterprises concessions
in the way of land, etc., and especially in the
system of rentals to mills at a nominal sum
per acre per annum of timber lands, by which
investment therein is avoided, is ot marked
advantage to the lumber industry on that side
as compared with the ruling rates of stump
age on the American side or the otherwise
necessity of large investments in timber lands
by purchase, the interest on which, with taxes,
etc., exceeds said rentals, unless the American
industry has maintained to it the present pro
tection, which it is feared your honorable
committee is about to disturb.
We further submit to your honorable com
mittee that the lumber trade of the United
States represents a larger investment nnd
affords labor to a greater number of employes
than any other single industry, while on the
Pacific Coast the ratio of both Investment and
employes, as applied to volume of business, is
far beyond that <bt other sections. Xo other
industry, not its outgrowth, except coal (which
is likewise menaced by the proposed tariff
changes), exists in the new Northwest In all
that area west of the Cascade Mountains; it in
creases the taxable wealth, gives employment
to hundreds of thousands, in mills, in woods,
and on land and sea ; its commerce and the
trade stimulated to supply the mechanical

ments of the myriads depending upon it for a
livelihood has made populous magnificent
cities on tLe shores of Puget Sound, and It is
incredible that its destruction CP.n be consid
ered, when such destruction will be the inev
itable result of the abrogation of the tariff as
to this industry.
It is not to be expected that the lumber man

MADDOX FOR SECRETARY.
Chairman Alford Makes Some
More Appoint
ments.
W. H. Alford, chairman of the Demo
cratic State Central Committee, has made
further progress In the completion of the
State party machine by appointing one of
the secretaries and two more committees.
The secretary named is Ben M. Maddox
of Visalia, Democratic nominee for Secre
tary of State two years ago. Mr. Alford
is authorized to appoint two secretaries.
As far as he knows they will have equal
rank and co-ordinate powers.
The committee on speakers is as follows:
William Craig, San Francisco, chairman ;
John H. Grady and W. J. Brobeck, San
Francisco; John H. Rosseter, Oakland;
J. W. Cochrane, Marin.
The following is the literary committee:
John Markley, Sacramento, chairman; T.
Carl Spelling, M. M. Miller, Franklin K.
Lane, William P. Lawlor, Joseph Leggett,
San Francisco; John W. Mitchell, Los
Angeles.
The State Central Committee will hold
its next regular meeting next Saturday
afternoon. The advisory committee will
hold its first meeting next Thursday after
noon, and the legislative committee will
meet Saturday forenoon.
Cock-Fighter* in Court.
The cases of the eignteen men arrested Sun

Calls Him Incorrigible.
Mrs. Mary Winn of 20& Andover street, legal
guardian and actual stepmother of Albert and
John Winn, complains that the first named, a
boy of 14, is incorrigible, being given to pro
fanity and general bad conduct. The Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has
the case under .consideration.
ufacturers of this coast, with the accumula
tions of a lifetime in the balance and strug
gling against the disastrous effects of over
production and consequent competition of
late years, can view with complacency the
further jeopardy threatened by free trade,
but it is not alone in the menace to indi
ividual interests that this protect has empha
sis; pride of section prompts the inquiry:
What possible compensation can be offered for
this proposed disturbance? What gain to the
section, estate or Nation is expected in return
for the surrender of American markets to Brit
ish Columbia (that has no products to export
that this coast has not in surplus aud will have
in surplus for years to come) when such sur
render involves the certain obliteration of tax
able wealth created by this industry alone;
destroys the labor and trade of thousands,
transfers to alien ships and railroads the traffic
our own require, and even places the hand
ling of the trade at ports of consumption with
a non-resident class, who will not contribute a
dime to the revenues of the country, leaving
only to the American citizen the payment of
the bill?
Such a course would, indeed, be "giving to
those that have," since the lumber manufac
turers of British Columbia have "protection"
enough, from the paternalism of their own
Government, without like aid from that of the
United States; and against such aid, in any
form, the entire lumber trade of the Pacific
Coast, regardless of party affiliation, have now
and always to most emphatically protest.
The company has the honor, both in voicing
this protest and submitting same to your hon
orable committee, to subscribe itself on behalf
of its confreres, very respectfully yours,
Pacific Pine Lombee Company.
E. M. Hereick, President. Â»
The Buckley Lumber Company of Buck
ley, Wash., asks for a tariff as the remedy
for depression of business and idleness of
workingmen in the great lumber regions.
It is opposed to tne free-trade policy of the
Wilson bill, so ardently upheld by Wil
liam Jennings Bryan, and gives the fol
lowing reasons for the McKinley tariff as a
remedy forhard times:
"During the season of 1892 we ran very
little, for the reason that there was no de
mand for our output. Last season wab the
first that we have not run steadily.
"We think the old rate in the tariff act
of 1890 would be of greater benefit to us
than any other rate, for the reason that a
specific duty is preferable on lumber, a?
there would in that event be no object to
undervalue cargoes. Our reason for ask
ing a duty on lumber is that we are com
pelled to sell our products in competition
with lumber manufacturers in British Co
lumbia, who employ Chinese labor at less
than one-half what we have to pay white
labor. In many places about the mill and
logging camps a Chinaman will do as well
as a white man, and in the planing-mill
department they will do even better. By
employing Chinese lumber can be pro
duced from $1 to $1 50 per 1000 cheaper

Chauncey O.cott in the Beautiful
"Mavourneen" at the Cal
ifornia.
The Columbia, the Tivrfli, the Or
pluum and Other Places Offer
Pleasing Bills
Chauncey Olcott made his initial ap
pearance in this City in "Mavourneen" at
the California last evening. Many first
nighters were there, and curiosity was on
edge concerning Mr. Olcott, about whom
so much that is laudatory has been said.
He did not disappoint expectation. On
the contrary he grew constantly in favor
from the beginning until he was a prime
favorite with those who occupied the seats
when the curtain finally fell on the last
scene.
Mr. Olcott was visibly nervous when he
began. He has met with favor in the
East. He has been in California before,
singing with the Emerson minstrels. He
had never taken a title role or any role
here before last night. Something akin

to stage fright came over him. His recep
tion in the first act ought to have been and
was reassuring. A comparatively unim
portant song brought forth warm ap
plause.' His voice was sweet but unsatis
factory, but the applause warmed and
stimulated him. Subsequent songs
brought out the full volume of his voice,
and manifested the fact that his sympa
thetic iuanner and sweet voice have not
been overestimated in advance.
"Mavourneen" â the title being sug
gestive of Crouch's ballad of "Kathleen
Mavourneen" â is full of sentiment. The
scenes are all seemingly shaped up to
make opportunities for a ballad-singing
Irish troubadour. Such Mr. Olcott isâ a
ballad singer who is so impressionable
and emotional that his mood is catching.
At the eva of the second act he wab called
before the curtain. He was not permitted
to go aloDg uninterruptedly witu his
than with white labor for rough lumber,
and from $2 to $3 per 1000 cheaper for
dressed lumber.
"The cost of manufacturing lumber in
Washington is 73 per cent of the entire
cost of output. This represents the wages
paid. If the product is reduced in value
15 per cent by taking the duty off that
will reduce the wages paid laboring men
to that extent. Common laborers, who
now get $1 75 a day, would then nave to
work for $1 50."
It requires little argument to convince
the simplest man that the Wilson bill,
idol of Bryan and ideal of pure Democ
racy, would soon force American 'laborers
out of employment or make them wear
queues and live like Chinese. Who Knows
best about these thingsâ practical Amer
ican lumbermen or "boy orators" who in
dulge in the pyrotechnics of metaphor
and flowery speech? Herp are some more
solid facts from the Buckley Lumber
Company. They say that foreign pauper
labor, under free trade, ruins their indus
try. Their account runs as follows:
"We have but one course left open to ns
to meet free importation of lumber, and
that is to reduce our wages until we can
meet any and all competition or shut our
mill down.
'â¢We employ about sixty men; no women
or children. We pay common laborers
$175 to $2: skilled labor, from $2 50 to $6
per day.
"They work sixty hours per week.
"The character of foreign competing ar
ticles, lumber manufactured in British
Columbia; they are continually encroach
ing on our territory on this side of the
line, offering lumber for less than we can
produce it for at the present schedule of
wages."
How do these figures compare witn the
lurid prophecy of Bryan in his great Con
gressional speech in defense of the Wilson
bill? He maae a reputation as an orator
then by making the false and misleading
prophecy that free lumber and free wool
would cause general prosperity, result in
renewed activity of mills and an increase
in the wages of American employes. He
put himself on record without reservation
as the rankest of freetraders and made a
record by defending the doctrines of the
Cobden Club of England.
It may not be generally known that the
California redwoods, which nature has
protected by making them to grow in no
other country than here, are affected in a
disastrous way by the importation of for
eign pines. Why? Because they feel the
fall of prices by sympathy.
When prices go away down, when the
market is ruined by the British Columbia
product, dealers in redwood must reduce
their prices, as pine is chosen in prefer
ence to the redwood.
A study of every phase of the problem
will show that nothing has done more
harm to the lumber industry than Cleve
landism, but Cleveland's tariff for revenue
ideas are mild indeed compared with the
wild free-trade sentiments of William Jen
nings Bryan of Nebraska. His policy
would destroy every factory in the land
and make American workingmen worse
than the serfs of England in the ages of
feudalism.
lines, for the audience speedily put him in
his proper place. They would rather hear
him sing than listen or watch the play at
large. No better ballad singing has been
heard in California in years.
Mr. Olcott was also very satisfactory as
the rollicking, manly, unaffected, affec
tionate and brave Irish lad, whom drama
tists like to portray. There are enough
scenes of daring and pathos to awaken the
enthusiasm of those who go to a play for
the sake of the sudden and unexpected.
The scenes are pleasing and well contrived
on the whole. The support was good.

aitional stage priest. Two little children
furnished a pretty by-play. In the play are
a plot, an abduction, a rescue and the un
raveling of the plot. Incidentally there is
a real old-fashioned Irish jig, a minuet
and several quite striking positions.
Above all and leading all are the vocal
ebilities of Chauncey Olcott, who is a good
enougn actor to justify fully his favorite
title of "the singing comedian."
The play is wholesome in its teaching,
has pretty incidents and seemingly pos
sesses all the elements of lasting popu
larity.
The Columbia.
Whoever chose "A Gold Mine" as the comedy
in which to introduce Wilton Lackaye to the
Columbia patrous made an error.
Mr. Lackaye is no more fitted for the role of
Silas K. Woolcott than he would be for that oJ
"Black Cloud, the Terror of the Plains."
Mr. Lackaye is a sterling actor, whose-ability
none will gainsay, and last night he played the
leading part in ms usual careful ana painstak
ing manner, but he suffers in comparison with
a Westerner like Nat Goodwin.
Mr. Lackaye is unfortunate in having had
the role thrust upon him. Goodwin is tne
real Westerner, with the genuine Western
flavor. Lackaye is the New York imitation
who wouldn't go an Instant in a real mining
camp. For all tnat Mr. Lackaye did well and
fairly earned what applause he got.
As the Hon. Mrs. Thorndyke Meredith Mrs.
Boucicault was a revelation. She is a past mis
tress in the art of repartee, and her graceful
manner of grilling her unfortunate lover was
productive of much applause.
Of "A Gold Mine" it is unnecessary to say
anything. The comedy is too well" known
locally to need description. Of the artists, be
sides the two mentioned, only words of praise
may be spoken, except in the case of Frank
Worthing, who scarcely Knew his lines, and
stuck a dozen times or more. Miss Hops Ross
was as charming as usual; Miss Madge Carr
Cook was what she should be, while Maclyn
Arbuckle. George W. Leslie, Tyrone Power
and Wilson Enos played their parts in their
usual praiseworthy manner. Taken all in all,
the play as presented at the Columbia is well
worth seeing.
At the Baldwin,
"The Benefit of the Doubt," which was given
by Charles Frohman's Empire Company at the
Baldwin Theater last eveniug, is a pretty soci
ety piny, very natural and very smoothly
played, and was consequently a treat to the
large audience. The play hangs on the
unreasonable and realistic jealousy of a hand
some woman, wlio wildly commences a suit for
divorce, foolishly naminsr another young wife
who is madly iv love with her own husband
as corespondent. Of course the complications
of the story are interestingâ often comic and
frequently touching.
The husbands of the two women are help
lessly tossed here and there by the wives, their
relatives and the divorce court. Annie Irish
as Mrs. Olive Allinpham, the jealous wife, is
excellent in that diffcult pun and in a perfect
running mate to William Fuversham, wlio
plays John Allinghnm.
One of the jolliest little scenes is where
Viola Allen as Theophila Fraser, tbe innocent
corespondent, a moment before cast down,
drinks a glass of champagne and throws off her
woe with her bonnet and becomes quite frisky
with her alleged partner iv guilt.
He knowing that his almost reconciled wife
is listening behind the curtain is in misery.
Finally the play closes with the reconciliation
complete. The piece will be given the rest of
the week.
At the Grand.
"The Danites" was splendidly staged and
well given at the Grand Opera-house last even
ing with James M. Brophy as Saudy McKee.
The old play is changed gomewhat from the
usual version, and the change is an
improvement. Fred J. Butler as Charles
Godfrey, called the "Parson," because he

At the Tivoli.
To call "I Pagliaccl" a success would seem
faint praise. The enthusiam shown at the
Tivoli last night at the opening presentation
transcended anything of the sort thus far seen
since the grand opera season commenced.
The applause was constant.
Owine to the shortness of the opera an or
chestral concert was given from 8 to 9 o'clock
under Mr. Hinrich'a direction. The pro
gramme opened with Nlcolai'* overture to
"Tne Merry Wives of
The rendering seemed to be perfect. The
ballet music from Gounod's "Faust," so sel
dom attempted in this part of the world, was
given with much airy grace and rythmic
leeling.
As for the opera, Miohelena was the star, and
no one attempted to share the honor with him.
His wild agony of despair, set to music which
sounds like one long cry of pain wrung from a
broken heart, was last night's triumph.
Nini Bertiui-Huraphreys makes a charming
Columbine and fills me exacting role very ac
ceptably. .
Raffael, as Silvio, the lover of a day and the
partner of his lady-love in death, earned the
api>lause which rewarded his every effort. The
scenic effects, not very elaborate in "I Pag
hacci," are harmonious and Â«ppropriate. The
opera will be repeated this evening.
At ihe Orphenm.
This week's bill is an unusually fine one,
being noticeable in particular for the widest
variety combined with a uniform standard of
excellence. Tne marimba players from An
tigua, Guatemala, who have delighted the
Orpheum's audiences in days past were seen
and heard by the patrons of the favorite place
of amusement last night again. Mrs. Lydia
Yeamans-Titus is a marvel. Another woman
who can sing, and sing like an angel, is the
rightly so-called "Black Pstti," Sissieretta
Jones. Her trilling is a wouder oi sweet, soft
naturalness.
The Vaidi sisters on their revolving electric
wheels perform a number of singularly grace
ful and intricate evolutions, while Biondi in
his "one-man opera" is as popular as ever.
The four Nelson sisters go through an acro
batic performance requiring the finest poise,
while Herr TeC how's cats and several other
fine specialties contribute to make up a rarely
interesting programme.
The Chutes.
Business at the Chutes la on the rush and
the new bill in the Casino has made a pro
nounced hit. There are a couple of very
clever girls, who do a skirt dance and play the
banjo at the same time, a conjurer, vocalists
and "Young Sandow," who performs feats of
strength that may make his namesake look to
his laurels.
"Joe," the educated orang-outang, is learn-
Bomething new every day. His latest accom
plishment is picking out coins of any denom
ination simply af the word of command.

A HOUSE DIVIDED.
Peculiar Domestic Menage of the I.ahne
Family, .Late of Mendocino County.
On the 13th of February last, according
to a report presented to the late Secretary
McComb of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, Mrs. Fannie Lahue,
a handsome woman of 27 years, left her
husband's ranch near Ukiah, in company
with a man, taking two of her four chil
dren. Three rveeks ago she left the two
little ones in charge of Mrs. Clara Jackson,
at 17% Rausch street, since which time
she has not returned for them, nor con
tributed anything to their support.
Mr. Lahue, who is at present in town,
states that his wife's mode of life is far
from commendable. Upon learning the
facts in the case, Secretary Welch <>f the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children wrote to Lahue. asking him to
make some provision for his children.

FOR PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLET, of Obio
FOR VICK-PKBUIDENT-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1SÂ»Â».
Watson sticks to Bryan like a cockle
burr to a donkey's tail.
McKinley and the masses against Bryan
and the blatherskites is the way it stands.
Almost any kind of spirit can be found
in the Democratic party except enthu
siasm.
The men who are ardent in support of
the Chicago platform are men who haven't
read it.
You can tell the silver-mine owner in
these days by his limp. The leg pulling
has begun.
Bourke Cockran is another stalwert
Democrat who bolts the Chicago ticket be
cause he cannot swallow it.
No man can consider tbe industrial
situation of California without seeing the
necessity of a protective tariff.
The free-trader may talk of free silver
and prosperity, but he is still tbe same
old enemy of American industry.
The renomination of Mr. Loud in the
Fifth District has made Kelly's vindica
tion race feel tired of itself already.
The breaking up of the free-lunch route
will be construed by the average Democrat
as another blow at his privileges as a citi
zen.
Gorman reiterates his willingness to
support tbe Chicago ticket, but all the
same he has never been heard to say that
he likes it.
Just as soon as the Populists get a good
warm movement on them you will see
them taking to the middle of the road and
giving Democracy the ha ha.
The campaign has hardly been started
and yet Bryan has already been put on
the defensive to such an extent that he
asks for time before answering.
The present condition of business and
industry will not survive the campaign.
We will have either McKinley and some
thing better or Bryan and something
worse.
The development of the sugar industry
under a Republican tariff would put more
money into the hands of workingmen
than would free coinage under a Demo
cratic tariff.
A vote for McKinley is a vote for sound
money, sound business and sound sense,
while a vote for Bryan is a vote for sound,
sound, sound, without either money, busi
ness or sense.
The efforts of the Examiner to represent
the Republican party as a defender of the
funding bill is one of the most futile fakes
of the campaign and shows that Democ
racy itself needs a defender to save it
from its fakers.
Bryan's reply to the charge of being a
hireling of the silver-mine owners is not
waited with any great degree of interest.
What difference does it make whether he
worked bis chin for hire or simply be
cause he couldn't keep it still?
The more the people reflect upon the
issues of the campaign the more clearly
do they perceive that the Republican
party is tha only one they can rely upon
to proteot the property interests of the
country and restore prosperity to the
people.
"The movement launched at Chicago,"
says Bonrke Cockran, "is an attempt to
take property from the hands of those
who created it and place it in the hands of
those who covet it," and that is exactly
the way it looks to every intelligent man
in tbe country.
Bryan was nominated by the Populists
on tbe express understanding that Sewall
was to be withdrawn and the Vice-Presi
dency given to Watson, but there is now
every prospect that the Democrats will
break tbe agreement and betray the men
who trusted them.
Eyery student of financial affairs knows
that a strong sentiment in favor of inter*
national bimetallism exists in every nation
in Europe, and with a strong Republican
administration in office and restored pros
perity in the country it will be easy for us
to lead the way to the free coinage of
silver by methods that will not disturb
business.
The development of the beet-sugar in
dustry in this Slate under tbe direction
â nd management of so able a business
man as Claus Spreckels will result in a
large increase of profit to farmers and to
workingmen, and will not only save to
Dalfornia much money we now send
ibroad bat will bring money into the
Bute and thereby enable us to develop
sther industries also.
THE SALINAS BANQUET.
Tho reception given at Salinas to Mr.
Claus Spreckels by the people oi Monterey
County is one of the events of the day that
can be regarded with no little satisfaction
by Californians of all classes. It was a
gathering of men representing all forms of
industry in the county, both urban and
rural, and gave expression to the common
esteem which all industrious men have
for those great promotors of industry
whose works tend to increase prosperity,
advance civilization and add to the wel
fare of all.
The occasion was in every way worthy of
such a gathering. Mr. Spreckels went to
Salinas to announce to the farmers of the
surrounding district that if they would
furnish him with the sugar beets he would
erect in that county the largest and best
equipped sugar refinery in the world. In
his address he said: "The fnctory will
cover a wide area of land. It will eat up
3000 tons of beets every day and turn out
every day 450 tons of refined sugar ready
for market. That means the distribution
among the farmers of $12,000 every day,
and $5000 more paid to workmen and for
other materials in the manufacturing.
You can see, therefore, that this is an im
portant matter. Now, as I say, it is for
you to grow tbe beets. I'll do the rest,"
It is scarcely necessary to say that an
address of that kind, containing a promise
of such industrial munificence from a man
whose promises are as good as gold,
awakened a true enthusiasm among the
listeners. Such an announcement of en
terprise would be noted as a matter of im
portance even in the largest cities and to
the wealthiest States in the Union. To
the people of Salinas and of Monterey
County it was an assurance of the begin
ning of a veritable new era. An industry
which will distribute $12,000 among farm
ers and $50(J0 among workingmen every
day of thÂ« year will surely exert a power
ful and ever-widening influence for good,
and by the wealth it diffuses through the
community afford the means for the estab
lishment of n<jw industries and new enter
prises as yet undreamed of.
The glowing prospect, moreover, is not
confined to the limits of Monterey County
or Salinas Vailey. Every part and portion
of California will derive some benefit and
good from the development of this great
industry. The ambition of Mr. Spreckels
is not limited to the construction of a
single refinery to be the largest in the
world. He desires to make California tbe
largest sugar-producing section of the
world, to raise the output from this State
to a point where it will be able not only to
supply all the needs of its own people, but
to ship abroad annually not less than 60,
-000,000 tons of refined sugar. That means,
of course, a steady golden revenue flowing
into the State to add its stimulus to every
trade and brighten the comforts of every
home.
It is worth noting, moreover, that for
this great factory to be established in their
county, Mr. Spreckels asks of the people
of Monterey neither the land for a site,
nor a present, nor a bonus of any kind.
All that he asks to make California the
sugar-producer of the United States is
somo protection against the competition
of the cheap labor of Europe. It is his
intention to maintain the rate of wases
now prevailing in California, and his de
sire is to increase them if possible. Cer
tainly, therefore, workingmen, farmers
and tradesmen of every class and degree
should support him in the work. As B.
V. Sargent said at the Salinas banquet:
"The man who has made Huntington,
the greatest railroad magnate oi tbe world,
bow the knee to him; the man who could
go to Philadelphia and swallow the sugar
trust, digest it cobblestones and all and
return to California in serene health and
some $10,000,000 better off, will not fail in
this undertaking. It behooves us to join
Him and hold up his hands to our utmost
ability."
DEMOCRATIO DISAFFECTION.
If the ring that captured the Democratic
convention at Chicago has been making
calculations on carrying New York, Bourke
Cockran has completely upset them all.
Mr. Cockran returned from Europe last
Saturday, and not many hours after land
ing he had a plan formulated to defeA
Bryan. Undoubtedly Mr. Cockran is one
of the most astute Democratic politicians
in the country, besides be appears to have
taken off his coat and entered the cam
paign for no purpose other than to pre
vent Bryan's election. Hitherto Mr.
Cockran has been classed with the Bourbon
wing of his party, but he believes that the
political situation is such as to justify
every Democrat who loves the principles
of his party in giving his hearty support
to Major McKinley.
Mr. Cockran says in so many words to
support the Cnicago nominee ia to encour
age disorder, repudiation ana confusion
in all the channels of business. The work
ingmen of the country are especially
appealed to to join in a crusade against
the man whose theories of Government
are hostile to labor. He believes Bryan's
election would introduce a reign of com
munism and not only paralyze all indus
tries, but make .an enforced division of
property accumulation. He believes that
with Bryan as President and a Congress
in sympathy with him every workingman,
and everybody else for that matter, who
had by industry and frugality accumulated
a home would be assailed by those who
prefer idleness to industry.
It is of no consequence whether Mr.
Cockran has overdrawn the picture or not.
It is enough to know that there is enough
in the situation to cause alarm when such
an uncompromising Democrat as he advo
cates the combining of the patriotic ele
ment of his party with the Republicans,
and together make the defeat of Altgeld
ism a common cause. But Mr. Cockran
is not the only prominent Democrat who
is willing to put aside party allegiance for
the time. John R. Fellows, Mr. Whitney
and scores of other well-known party
leaders are declaring war upon the Chicago
platform and nominees, and it is a mis
take to suppose that their following among
the rank and file is not in sympathy with
them. Nevertheless, it is the duty of Re
pubicans to make haste to organize in
every voting district. The burden of the
work of defeating Bryan is upon the
shoulders of the rank and file of the Re
publican party. Do not forget tnat.
NO MIDDLE GROUND.
Bryan and hia managers are seeking
personal gain at the expense of honest
and industrious citizens. There is noth
ing in their declaration of principles that
is not vicious in purpose, and, although
the campaign is not fully under way, it
has reached the stage where it becomes
the duty of every supporter of good
government, protection to labor and
sound money to publicly so announce
himself. The plan of campaign adopted
by the Bryan machine is to appeal to the
worst eiement of the country with prom
ises that the Supreme Court shall be
overthrown and the Nation's treasury
turned into a public money supply agency.
The theme of Bryan speakers will be
"plenty of money and little work." It is
already to be noticed that in the large
cities tbe lawless and always idle element
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 4, 1896.
is arraying itself on the side of the Chicago
nominee. An opportunity to loot the
Government, as well as all who have ac
cumulated wealth, will be furnished, this
element believes, if Bryan is elected, hence
it shouts for "Bryan."
Naturally all good citizens are desirous
that the country shall have the best pos
sible government, but the time has come
when desire that is not expressed in
telling work avails nothing. Every right
thinking voter knows that he is a force in
the contest that is now being waged for
political supremacy, and he know 9 that
there is no middle ground between good
and baa government. He knows, there
fore, that he is aiding or abetting thÂ«
enemies or the friends of safe government,
not only in opinion out in what h i says
and does opanly. It must be rememb re Â
too, that it is not only the bad effect of
Bryan's election which would be seen in
his administration of four years that is to
be considered. The mere indorsement of
the theories he advocates would result in
the most serious consequences to ail lines
of industry and trade, for it would mean
that the people had abandoned all the
true and tried principles of business
operations for vicious and hurtful meth
ods.
Four years of the employment of such a
code of commercial and financial ethics
as Bryan advocatss would be likely to
undo what has been done in a third of a
century and cripple commerce for as
many years to come. It is a fearful
thing to exchange the fundamental prin
ciples of our government and trade dis
tribution for business theories that are
diametrically opposed to those which
have enabled the country to become the
wealthiest and the most prosperous nation
in the world. But they will be so changed
if the honest and the industrious voters of
the country do not organize an opposition
to Bryanisni that shall be felt in every
community. It is now a question of pre
serving the credit and business oppor
tunity of the people, and there is no mid
dle ground for any man to stand upon.
JONES SHOWS HIS HAND.
Chairman Jones of the National Demo
cratic Committee has thrown the Popu
lists upon the defensive, and now it re
mains to be seen whether they are "ig
norant cranks" or men possessing some
independence and manhood. Senator
Jones gives it out that Mr. Bryan will not
accept the Populist nomination with Wat
son as running mate; that Bryan did not
ask for the nomination; that the honor
was forced upon him, ana that he pro
poses to stand by Sewall in any event.
Senator Jones intimates, however, that
the Democracy has in its pocket all of the
PoDulist party that is worth having, and
that the balance may go toâ or rather, as
Bryan's newspaper puts it, "Let the hea
then rage."
Nevertheless, the Populists have a few
pretty strong men who will certainly re
fute what Mr. Jones says, and there are
intimations that if forced to they will
divulge certain convention secrets which
would be very much better for Bryan's
managers to have kept under cover. One
of these hints suggests the probability of
an agreement between Bryan's convention
managers and certain middle-of-the-road
Populists, that if the convention would
nominate Bryan and a Populist running
mate he, Bryan, would give his consent to
have Sewall crowded out. It is claimed
that such an agreement was made in good
faith, and that the change of front was not
made until Chairman Jones, Senator
Allen, General Weaver and Governor Hoi
comb made up their minds that tbe Popu
list party could not bolt Bryan without
disrupting its own organization, when they
put on a bold front and repudiated the
agreement.
However much truth there may be in
tbe agreement story it is very evident that
the Democratic machine believes it has
tbe major part of the Populist party in its
cold storage bin ready to be ground into
Bryan and Sewall voters, but the Popu
lists may escape from the bin. Bui the
hardest blow that has been given the
Populists since their capture is in putting
Senator Gorman, tbe bitterest enemy they
have on earth, as the campaign boss.
Gorman may be trusted to not leave the
PoDulists an inch of ground to stand upon.
He will manage by hook or by crook to
make another National convention impos
sible, even if he has to sacrifice Bryan to
doit. In this connection it might be ob
seljred that Gorman looks upon Bryan's
nomination as a crime against the party,
and if he can reclaim the State of Mary
land by making a trade that will give Mc-
Kinley tbe electoral vote of tbe State he
can be trusted to do it. But in any event
the Populist party is done for unless tbe
executive committee throws Bryan over
board. ___________
LUMBER UNDER FREE TRADE.
In a second article on the lumber indus
try in The Call of to-day it is shown con
clusively by the evidence of experts that
the business has fared badly under the
AY; I son bill.
A clo*e investigation into the causes of
depression reveals tbe fact that American
lumbermen and American workmen fare
badly under that form of Bryanisni seen
in the Wilson free- trade law. The patri
otic voter will naturally ask what is to
become of the country if Bryan's policy
should prevail. The Wilson bill is a strik
ing object lesson of the workings of Bry
anisni, because William Jennings Bryan
distinguished himself by becoming the
champion orator for that particular form
of free trade. He is identified with the
ruinous Wilso.n bill more than with any
any other measure.
The student of practical results should
not fail to read the final story of tne ruin
wrought by Bryan's policy, as told in the
local columns of to-day's Call.
FOR UNCLE SAM'S BUTTONHOLE.
There is a proposition that the columbine
should be adopted an the National floral em
blem of the United States. It grows wild in the
region where Columbus was born, as well as in
the Rocky Mountain State. A front view of
the flower shows the outline to be a beautiful
five-rayed utar, emblematic of the stars of the
National flag, while the leaf terminates in
thirteen lobes, the number of the stripes, as
well as of the original States of the Union.
While the columbine grows in many colors,
three colorsâ the brilliant red, pare wnlte and
exquisite cerulean blue â xre the American
variety of the flower. A single petal of one of
the long-spurred variety is in the shape of a
horn of plenty, while the botanical and horti
cultural name of tha flower is aquilegia, con
nected with the Latin aquila, an eagle.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Conde Jones of Los Angeles, Stanford Uni
versity's hope as a fullback in the season of
'92, arrived here yesterday on a visit. He was
a dashing, brilliant player and the most prom
ising: punter Palo Alto ever had, but shortly
before the big intercollegiate match in a prac
tice game on the Stanford campus with the
Oakland High School team, he was tackled by
Ransome, now the captain-elect of the TJni
versity;of California eleven, and in the violent
fall had a collar-bone and a rib broken. Co-eds
wept, for Jones was their idol, and during the
next few days he was the recipient of nu
merous dainty missives and bouquets, along
with some original verse. Even Mrs. Stanford
and the professors' wives paid tribute to the
injured gridiron hero. Physicians labored
o.sr him, and the medical director had a most
-ci larkable corset made so that Jones might
be protected from injury and be able to play,
anyway. One afternoon a week before the great
game Jones appeared on the gridiron again,
wearing his armored corset and shoulder pro
tector. He was a little cautious and seemed to
lack his former dash. The next night the In
tensely interested, watching hundreds along
tbe sidelines had about decided that Jones was
coming around all right when from a con
fused mass that had fallen upon him he was
assisted to his feet, but he could not stand.
His ankle was sprained. It was his right
ankleâ his punting foot â and a great
wave of despair passed over the crowd,
for fate was surely favoring Berkeley 1
The doctor worked over that ankle nearly
all night. The result of the game might de
pend upon his skill. Two days afterward
Jones, with rubber bandages and elastic sup
porters upon the weakened ankle, and wear
ing his strange canvas corset, came out once
more to do or die for the cardinal; and all
went well through the furious practice in
slush and mud. But the end was not yet. As
he was riding on a bicycle in the rain the
wheels slipped and the ill-fated athlete was
thrown in such a way that even the bandages
did noc prevent a serious wrench of the ankle.
On the day of the big match a tall, sorrowful
young fellow, wearing citizen's clothes and
leaning; upon crutches, had an honored place
inside the sidelines out at the Haight-street
grounds, but when the game was over Jones
forgot his sorrow and his crutches and limped
hurriedly over to mingle with the players he
had so anxiously watched.
R. Levison Ogilvie, wno has for some time
been in charge of a Government school at
Hauula, a district about twenty-five miles
from Honolulu, arrived at the Lick yesterday
with his wlfft. He says that when he went to
the islands be was inclined to be a strong roy
alist, but is now thoroughly convinced that
the present form of the Hawaiian Government
is best for all concerned and could hardly be
improved. The Kanakas, he declares, are too
easy-going ever to fight for anything, and
thare is no danger of them taking up arms
against the republic, The native children
learn in a parroty fashion, but lack executive
ability and the power of applying principle's.
What the islands have to fear is the steady en
croachment of Chinese and Japanese, who
may even crowd the older merchants out of
business and cause unsatisfactory comparisons
to be made between conditions under the
monarchy and those under the republic. Mr.
Ogrilvie was a contributor to the Kilohaua Art
League, a society organized in Honolulu two
years ago, with Mr. Hitchcock an president
ar.d with Mr. Hutchinsou, the island sculptor,
one of the prominent members.

HAROLD FREDERIC.
A Call Correspondent Who -Writes . Ameri
can Novels as Well as Foreign .
News. /../... ,_.-'. -..
The Literary Digest of a recent date pays
marked attention to Harold Frederic, the bril
liant Journalist and author who writes lor The
Call such interesting letters on foreign affairs.
The article in the Literary Digest is entitled
"How the Popular Harold Frederic Works," !
and is mainly descriptive of his methods of
composition. ..; ; . . '.'â â  - .
The Digest says: Harold Frederic, the ;
American novelist, whose purely American i
stories first won fame for him la England, has
recently told a writer for the London Sketch
something about his method of work. One ;
striking thing about Mr. Frederic is, that
while he writes his American stories in Eng
land he keeps in the most intimate touch with
the life he describes. When . asked . about
the farm lite described in "Seth's Brother's
Wife," he answered:
"Biess you, man! I was brought up on or
near a farm. I spent my boyhood in getting
out of bed at 5 in the morning to look after
the cattle, and until I was 14 I drove a milk
wagon as a 'side issue' in my agricultural du
ties. For one of my stories I read company
law and that sort of thing under the instruc
tion of a well-known lawyer of my acquaint
ance. For 'In the Valley,' which, as you know,
deals with American life during the colonial
period, I made eleven years' study of the do
mestic and political history of that time, the
records, tbe 'costumes and properties.' Be
sides, I was born and reared in the New York
Valley that I wrote abou . The idea of the
story and the spirit of it soabsd in my mind
eleven years beiore I wrote the first chapter."
When asked to what extent he planned his
books before he wrote them, Mr. Fredeilc said:
"In one Bense, hardly at all. I seek only to
know my people through and through. They
make the story -off their own bat' once they
have been started. But you must really know
them first. I am now writing a novel ['The
Damnation of Theron Ware,' since published,
recently digested in these columns], the people
of whioh I have been carrying about with me,
night and day, for fully five years. After I had
got them grouped together in my mind, I set
myself the task of knowing everything they
knew. As four of them happened to be spe
cialists in different professions, the task has
been tremendous. For instance, one of them'
Is a biologist, who, among many other things,
is experimenting on Lubbock's and Darwin's
lines. Although these pursuits are merely
mentioned, I have got up masses of stuff on
bees and the crow-fertilisation of plants. I
have baa to teach myself all the details of a
Methodist minister's work, obligations and
daily routine and all the machinery of his
church. Another character is a priest, who
is a good deal more of a pagau than
a simple-minded Christian. He loves
luxury and learning. I have studied
the arts he loves as well as bis theology ; I have
waded In Assyriology and Schopenhauer;
pored over palimpsests and pottery, and, in
order to write understanding^ about a musi
cian who figures in tbe story. I have bored a
professional friend to death getting technical
musical stuff from him. I don't say this is the
right way to build novels; only it is my way."
The following dialogue then took place:
"In the name of patience, when do you
think out your story?"
"It shapes itself as Igo alone. Then I write
an elaborate sketch of what is just before me,
chapter by chapter, noting down the incidents,
leading bits of conversation, descriptions of
characters and localities, straight up to the
finish. This plan makes a little volume of
itself."
"And then?"
"Then the book writes itself; and, when It's
finished I'm sorry. The pleasure of a novelist's
life is living with bis characters. When the
book Is done, that pleasure, or the greater part
of it ceases. Then the people go out into the
world and he loses sight of them and has to
begin all over again and create a new set of
friends."

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
ON TERMS OF UNION.
The New Democracy and the People's
Pakty May Foem an Honorable
ALLIANCE.
To the Editor of the San Francisco CallâSW-
It is safe to say thai there is no subject of
greater interest in the political world to-day
than the probability of a practical and hon
orable union or alliance of the reform ele
ments in the new Democratic party and the
People's party. Most men are ready to cou
cede that such a union will insure the defeat
of McKinley and the election of Bryan. Is it
practical to secure an honest, fair-working
ana honorable union or alliance of the forces?
It depends upon two simple things, namely,
an earnest purpose on the part of Democracy
and the wisdom of its leadership.
It must be apparent that the time has come
in California for some plain speech in regard
to the essential terms of such union. It ia
my present purpose to state the terms on
which such alliance may become an accom
plished fact, as I understand the situation,
and I venture to say that I do not spealc for
myself alone. As a first consideration it is
necessary to clear away certain misapprehen
sions which seem to occupy the public mina,
and in particular the Democratic mina.
At the Chicago Democratic convention more
than a third of the Democratic party left it,
and practically went over to the Republican
party on tbe silver issue. The gains of the
Populists at the Oregon electiou, in spite of
General Weaver's baneful influence in favor
of almost unconditional msion on silver alone,
and the greater gaius in all by-elections in
Colorado, lowa, Georgia ana some other biaies
east of the Mississippi, clearly show moie than
a third increase in the Populist vote Miice the
general elections in the States in 1894. me
loss of Democracy and the gain of the People s
party really maice the Populists numerically
sironger in all the sliver States south of the
Ohio and the Potomac and west of the Missis
sippi than the present uew silver or Bryan
Democracy. At all events, Bryan Democracy
has no claims to superiority over the People s
party, either in numoers, intelligence, devo
tion to principle, unity of purpose, party fer
vor or patriotism. They may fairly be rated
as two equal forces. , . .
Up to date, since Bryan was nominated at
Chicago, however, the patronizing and over
bearing manner of the Democratic leaders and
newspupers toward Populisu exceeds that ol
a big burly brother toward a boy in short
clothes, and in fact reminds one of a big bully
as he swaggers and lords it over an inofleusive
and timid little man. This offensive manner
took on its worst form at St. Louis, where
Bryanized Populist office-seekers of the
Weaver type, and Mlventes of all types, Im
pudently attempted to force the nomination
of both Bryan and Bewail by the Populist Na
tional Convention and the consequent disin
tegration and final destruction of the People s
party. It failed ignomtniously. Two-ttnrdi
of that great convention scornfully repudiated
the brazen proposal and arose as one man,
without concert ol action or the inspiration
and guidance of leadership, and nominated
Watson for the Vice-Presidency before per
mitting Weaver and his Bryaniie confederates
to place Bryan before the convention as a can
didate for the Presidency. Notice was thereby
served on Bryanite Populists, bullying Demo
crats and sneering silverites. which even the
variest dullard should understand, that they
must call a halt to brazen assurance, and, no
matter how unwilling. y, they wust learn to
treat with Populists as allies and equals, and
not as helpless boys or pusillanimous vassals.
Assuming now tha* California Democrats as
â¢well as Democrats in all the possible silver
States have come to look at the situation under
the tranquillizing influence of sober second
thought, l desire to say a \, ord or two on the
first great obstacle to a complete and hearty
union of our forces. I refer to the nomination
of Banker Bewail as their candidate for the
Vice-Presidency and the Populist nomination
of Watson for the same cilice. It is claimed
that the prior nomination of Bewail by the
Democrats will render it practically almost
impossible to ask him to decline the nomina
tion, ami that Mr. Bryan himself is not willing
to accept the Populist nomination if Mr. Sew
ail is rejected by the Populists. But Populists
could not support a National banker for that
office withoutself-stultification, and intelligent
Democrats are aware of it; and a more seri
ous objection to Mr. Sewall is that the Populists
having nominated Mr. Bryan for the Presi
dency, they could not nominate the whole of
the Democratic ticket without being classed
and counted as Democrats at the polls, rnus
voting themselves out of existence as the Peo
ple's party; and the only way in which Popu
lists can maintain their organisation as a party
is to nominate a Populist for the VicÂ«-Presi
dancy and vote tor him as a Populist and have
their votes cast and counted as Populist votes.
Bui why should it be a virtue in Democrats
who seek an alliance with Populists and ask
for Populut votes to present two candidates
while it iscrin.inal presumption in Populists
to name a candidate for the second and infe
rior office? By supporting Bryan and Watson
both parties maintain their identity and the
Democrats get the lion's share; by voting for
Bryan ani Sewall Populists cease to exist as a
party and are counted as Democrats. If an al
liance is ever made on honorable terms Mr.
Sewall must not be a candidate.
But I have already devoted too much space
to Mr. Sewall. lam in possession oi informa
tion from the highest sources that Mr. Sewall
will decline to be a candidate and that Watson
will be placed on the Democratic ticket in his
place, so that there may be a complete union
or alliance of the two parties on joint candi
dates. If this should fail it will be Impossible
to hold the feotun to the compact, and
Colonel Norton and Tom Watson will be their
candidates, which will render the election of
Bryan and Sewall absolutely impossible. In
that case McKinley will be elected and the re
sponsibility will rest upon the presumptuous
and overbearing Democracy.
In California a lair division of tne Presi
dential electors, based on the last official vote
and the admitted losses of Deraocracv and
gains of Populism, will certainly entitle the Pop
ulists to at least four of the nine Presidential
electors and three of the seven Congressmen.
In the State Legislature the rule must be that
in districts where Democrats are stronger than
Populists, the Democratic candidate will re
ceive the joint vote of both parties, but the
reverse will be the rule wnen Populists poll
the larger vote. An open and honorable alli
ance on this basis will secure a successful and
practical union of these political forces and
the result will be a certain victory for the
allies in all parts of the State. To this alliance
I look forward as a foregone conclusion, and
believe that it can be consummated and carried
out so impartially and honorably that In due
time the allias will gradually coalesce in one
permanent and homogeneous political party.
The opportunity is here. The duty is impera
tive. The rewards are certain.

CALIFORNIA AUTHORS
Callfornians are turning out their full share
of books, and others are promised.
Joaquin Miller's volume, "Sonus of the 8onl,"
recently published, is soon to be followed by a
charming book called "An Itinerant House,"
by Emma Frances Dawson. This production
will be characterized by the genial mysticism
with which Miss Dawson flavors her work.
The book will be illustrated by Peixotto, and
is to be published by William Doxey, as will
be also two other volumes by California au
thors.
A book that promises to be of unusual in
terest will be "Wild Flowers of California,"
which will have more than 800 pages. The
author is Mary Elizabeth Parsons of San Ra
fael, and there are to be 150 illustrations
drawn from nature by Miss Buck. The ladies
are now In the Sierra Nevada region gathering
materials for the concluding chapters. Not
less than 600 wild flowers will be described.
Four valuable books dealing with this hub
lect have been published. Green's " Flora
Francisca," Dr. Beiir's "Bay Region Botany,"
Rattan's "California Flora" and Whitney's "De
scriptive Botany" in the official reports of the
California survey. None of these works are
illustrated. Miss Parsons' new book will be
the first to display the beauties of the field and
mountain flowers of California.
Samuel Jacques lirunn, assistant professor of
French at Stanford UnlverÂ»ity, is putting the
finishing toucties on a volume of "Talea of
Languedoc," being a series of Provencal folk
lore. The work Is to be enriched with fifty
drawings by Ernegt Peixotto.
Charles Freeman Johnson is engaged on an
important work relating to the "Good Roads
Movement."
A well-known journalist of this City has in
preparation a work which is intended to be a
characteristic Caliiornia novel, but he declines
the publicity of itn announcement until the
manuscript is ready for the printer. In this
volume much is to be made of the glorious cli
mate of Caliiornia. Indeed, the reader is to be

WOMEN AS PILOTS.
A Scandinavian correspondent writes to the
Berlin Tageblatt that In Denmark, Norway
and Finland the employment of women as
sailors is a matter of daily experience, and
that they are often found to be vejfy excellent
mariners. In the smaller sailing ships, where
there is a woman on board, whether she be
the wife of the skipper or the stewardess, she
Is expected to take her turn at the ordinary
work of the Bailor, not even excluding the du
ties of the man at the wheel, or of the night
watch. In Denmark several women are era
ployed at sea as state officials, and particu
larly in the pilot service. 'â¢They go far out to
sea to meet the Coming ships; they clamber up
nimbly out of their boats; they show their offl.
cial diploma and steer the newcomer bravely
find safely into the harbor." It is the same in
Finland. Experienced captains assert that
the women make excellent sailors, and are
equal to most seamen iv dexterity and power
of endurance. ________

little the worse for the battering she re
ceived off the Horn, but still thoroughly
seaworthy. It was a perilous voyage from
start to finish, and on one occasion Captain
Taylor had to put about and run away
down south in order to escape going ashore.
It took the Jordanhill since last January
to make the run from Liverpool to San
Francisco. Nearly two months of the
time waa spent in battling with adverse
winds off the cape and it was May 20 be
fore 50 sou in 85 west was reached. Sail 3
were blown out of the bolt ropes, the
bulwarks were carried away, the cabin and
forecastle were flooded and everything
movable was washed overboard.
The Jordauhill left Liverpool early in
January in tow of a tug. A gale came up
and the hawser parted. The vessel lost
all her head rails and had to come to an
anchor in order to prevent going ashore.
Two months later she was caught in an
other hurricane. The hail and sleet were
continuous, and the stormsals split one
after the other. Part of the bulwarks were
i-arried away, and everything movable on
deck was washed overboard.
On Aprii 9 a heavy gale from northwest
to west, increasing to a hurricane, was en
countered, and the lower topsails were
blown from the bolt ropes. The vessel was
forced down to 60 south, and the entire
crew suffered from the cold and exposure.
Captain Taylor sighted a number of ships
when in the southern waters but did not
speak any of them.
The only other overdue vessel from
Liverpool is the Blackbraes, now out 197
days. She also has had a bard time of it,
having to put back on account of stress of
weather and later having to put into
Montevideo on fire and leaking. Her en
ire cargo was discharged and she is now
on the ways undergoing repairs. The

The excursion to the wreck of tne
Colombia on the steamer Mexico last Sun
day was a genuine success. When off the
Farallones T. \v. Leydecker, the well
known pigeon-fancier of Alameda, released
ten of his young birds. They had never
been away from home before except on
one occasion when they were flown from
the Cliff House. The youngsters made
the flight in the fast time of 1 hour and 2
seconds. At the wreck ten more birds
were released, but only seven of these
readied home. They made the flignt in
2 hours 43 minutes. Of the seven six were
old birds and one was a young one. The
three missing are all youngsters, but Mr.
Leydecker is confident that they will turn
up. It was hazy at the time they were
liberated and one of them did not leave
the Mexico until she was close ashore.
Arthur Piper and John Open heim are
not likely to forget the excursion in a
hurry. They were standing forward of the
pilot-house when a big sea broke aboard
and washed them into the lee scuppers.
Another wave washed them along the
deck and nobody knows where they would
have landed if Captain Bennett and T. W.
Leydecker had not rushed to the rescue.
"Oh Lord! Oh Lord!" gasped Openheim.
"I thought I was overboard." Piper was
all right, but as there vns not a suit of
clothes on the steamer that would fit him
he had to "eeefc the seclusion that a cabin
grants" until his own were dried in the
engine-room. He says they are now two
sizes too small for him.
T. C. Wills, who ia superintending the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company's whal
ing excursion, is not letting the grass
grow under his feet. His boats' crews
have all been secured and the men are
hard at work daily getting the harpoons,
blubber-spades and bomb-guns in reali
ness for the occasion. The Oakland and
Alameda people want to witness the
sport, and the chances are that a Special
boat will be put on for the occasion. The
tug Fearless will be the flagship, and she
and the steamers that willaccompany her
will go up the coast as far as Drakes Bay.
If a whale be not sighted anchor will be
cast in the bay for the night and a clam
bake will be served in tbe morning. Sun
day a run down the coast will be in order,
and the chances are that a whale will be
picked up. In case of an accident a whale
boat, manned by the most experienced
boatmen in the bay, under command of
Henry Peterson, will be in readiness to
render assistance. The excursion should
be a pleasant and exciting one from start
to finish.

Pierre Brigaerts Arrested for Stealing
From Telephone Boxes.
Pierre Brigaerts. an electrician in the
employ of the Pacific Telegraph and
Telephone Company, was arrested yester
day morning by Special Officer W. Bram
naacc and booked at the City Prison on a
charge of petty larceny.
The company had been suspicious that
some one was stealing the money from tbe
telephone boxes and Bramn.age was put
on the case. Brigaerts, whose duty was to
repair telephones out of order, was sent
yesterday morning to repair a phone on
Gough >treet. Tien he was sent to one
two clocks away and when he returned he
was arrested. When searched 70 cents in
nickels were, found in his pockets, which,
it is claimed, he took from the box at

Brigaerts, who is a young married man
27 years of age, denies the charge and at
tributes his arrest to a foolish remark he
made about a week aco.

Court.
SERVING OF THE WRIT
Geary-Street Right of Way Will
Not Be Let Just at
Present.
MUST EXPLAIN THEIR ACTION
City Fathers Sa d to Want to Give
Away a Million Dollars of
City Money.
Judge Daingerfield yesterday issued an
injunction and a writ of prohibition re
straining the Board of Supervisors from
taking any further action at present in
the matter of selling the Geary-street
railway franchise.
The writs were issued at the instigation
of George R. Fletcher, who claims in the
complaints filed that tbe actions ol the
board in the matter are irregular.
First, the notices of the sale of the franchise,
as published in the afternoon papers, were not
published on the consecutive, days as pro
vided by law. A Sunday and a holiday inter
vened, on which occasions the paper was not
printed.
Second, because the resolution, notice and
advertisement regarding the sale failed to
comply with the terms of the application, in
that a clause was inserted by the Supervisors
providing fora yearly report of the gross earn
ings of the road, said report to be sworn to by
the president and secretary of the railway
company. On the strength of the report a tax
of 2 percent of the gross earnings of the com
puny was to be leviei and paid into the Street
Department fund. The clause further pro
vided that in .case the report was not furnished
the franchise should become void. It is said
that this clnnse was inserted by ihe Super
visors without warrant and in direct violation
of an act of the State Legislature of March 23,
1893.
The contention is that this stipulation
in the proposed franchise prevents and de
stioys fair, open and public competition
for the purchase of the right, privilege
and franchise and was inserted to destroy
public competition and restrict bids to the
Gearv-street, Park and Ocean Railroad
Company.
Tne complaint quotes the following por
tions of the proposed franchise:
The following grant is made upon the follow
ing conditions, strictly to be complied with by
said grantee, its successors and assigns:
Work to construct said railroad most be com
menced within one year from the date of the pass
age of this order, and the same must be completed
wltbtn three years thereafter.
Mr. Fletcher says that only tbe Geary
street, Park and Ocean Railroad Company
could comply with such terms and condi
tions, that company being the exclusive
owner and in exclusive possession of the
right of way along the streets named in
the franchise and is entitled exclusively to
maintain and occupy the same for the pur
poses of a street railway until November,
1903.
Should the franchise be sold un der the
present resolution, notice and advertise
ment to any other person or corporation
than the Geary-street road, it 13 said that
a great deal of expensive litigation with
the road mentioned would surely result
over the right of way. Fuither. it is set
forth that nobody but the Geary-street
road could obtain a clear and unclouded
title to the right of way.
Azain, it is said that the right of way ia
worth $1,500,000, but that under the pres
ent resolution but $500,000 could be ob
tained for it.
It is further alleged that the acts and
proceedings of the Board of Supervisors
are without its jurisdiction; that there is
no appeal therefrom and no adequate
remedy in the courts of law; wherefore it
is prayed that a writ of prohibition be
issued restraining the board from taking
further action in the matter at the present
time.
An injunction enjoining the board from
selling the franchise on August 3 was also
issued by Judge Daingerfield, as was a
writ of review commanding the" Super
visors to appear in court and explain their
actions in the matter.
Wben the franchise matter came up in
the board yesterday afternoon Supervisor
Dimond called the attention of the mem
bers to tbe fact that each had been served
with a copy of the injunction granted by
Judge Daingerfield. He moved that action
be deferred and tbe matter be referred to
the City and County Attorney. Supervisor
King seconded the motion and it was
carried.
MR. ASANO'S STEAMERS.
They Will Make San Francisco
One of Their Ter
mini.
Ample Dockage Has Been Secured
and Enough Local Business to
Guarantee Success-
Sachio Asano, president of the proposed
Oriental Steamship Company, whose ves
sels may ply between San Francisco and
Asiatic ports, had a conference with
Traffic Manager Stubbs yesterday.
Mr. Stubbs gave Mr. Asano every en
couragement. He laid emphasis upon the
fact that the port of San Francisco was
the most advantageous place on tbe coast
lor the line of steamships and that he
would afford him every facility possible.
There is now but very little doubt that
the line will come here. It has been al
ready guaranteed sufficient local business
to warrant the line making San Francisco
one of its termini. The question of dock
age has been settled very satisfactorily.

OLYMPIC NOMINATIONS.
Two Tickets Were in the Field
and One Favored a New
Board.
Indications Point to a Hot Campaign
Over the Presidency of the
Institution.
Three hundred members, who are inter
ested in the future welfare of the Olympic
Club, assembled in the gymnasium last
evening to select a nominating committee.
There were two tickets in the field â
white and yellow. The former ticket was
put forward by members who favored the
re-election of President Eaton, and the
yellow by men who favored, with few ex
ceptions, a clean sweep in the directorate
of the club.
The meeting was called to order by F.
W. Eaton, ana that gentleman spoke at
length on the management of the club's
affairs ever since the time of his election
to office. In the course of his remarks he
had occasion to hanl Secretary Bosworth
over the coals for not having the monthly
reports of the club posted in their custom
ary places, but the secretary replied that
he was not at fault in the matter, as he
had instructed the superintendent in this
particular.
Mr. Eaton read a report he had pre
pared of the financial condition of the
club, and explained in detail to the mem
bers present the difficulties that he had to
contend with in conducting successfully
such a heavy undertaking. He explained
the reasons for the decrease in member
ship and why the club was not financially
as prosperous as it was in former years.
Secretary Russ was loudly cheered when
he took the floor. He said. in brief that
he had for many years taken a deep inter
est in the affairs of tde Olympic Club and
that nothing gave him greater pleasure
than to ccc the club in a prosperous condi
tion. He did not touch upon its financial
affairs.
Mr. Eaton then called for nominations,
and after a short pause, Merton C. Allen
arose from his chair. He said that a
change for the better interest of the club
was, in his judgment, necessary; tbat the
club was not exactly what it should be and
that its financial condition might be to
day in a better state.
He then placed in nomination the fol
lowing gentlemen whose names appeared
on the yellow or gold ticket, viz. : Frank
J. Devlin, manager of the Atlas Insurance
Company; Charles H. Lamberton, cashier
of McLaughlin Estate Company; W. H.
Snedaker, general agent of the Rio Grande
Western Railway; George Watkins, man
ager Union Photo Engraving Company,
and John H. Hardy of Wells, Fargo &
Company.
James Sweeney followed in the footsteps
of Mr. Allen and spoke strongly in favor
of five gentlemen whose names appeared
on a white ticket. They were: George
Jones, president Dickman-Jones Com
pany; Charles K. Melrose, cashier Union
Ice Company ; Martin Stevens, attorney
at-law; Dr. O. B. Burns, dentist, and
Thomas Jennings, wholesale grocer.
Chairman Eaton suggested that the
members segregate and those favoring the
white ticket take the east side of the
gymnasium and their opponents the oppo

Interesting Session of the Army of
Lawyers in the Famous Will
Case.
All day yesterday in Judge 81ack's
court there was a breathless hovering on
the brink of great truths in the matter of
James G. Fair's last will.
A il the big lawyers engaged in that most
remarkable controversy were gathered to
gether, fencing, fencing.
Only one or two in all the army hold
the same sword and swear the same
allegiance under whicn only a brief year or
bo ago they started. Such substitution of
banners, such changes of front have been
made that it is hot strange that a man
hesitated to make a thrust at a one-time
enemy in the fear of slaying a friend ; that
be shall have held his hand when con
fronted by an o!d tentmate, and so run
chance? of being slain by his enemy. Did
not Horatius, after inviting a fair woman's
plaudits on his bravery, conspire delib
erately to hand the bridge over to the
invader?
George Knight and Garret McEnerney
Trere at daggers' points yesterd ay, Knight j
being the aggressor, when suddenly he !
brought confusion to his adversary who I
â¢was about to triumph at the moment the I
latter was about to deliver an effective
Btroke, by crying: "Hold! maize no mis
take. 1 may be your ally a little later."
"But you were my ally; till now I
thought you had been all along I" cried
McEnerney.
"I may be again," said Knight. "I
want to save you from mistakes that may
occur through any misunderstanding. We
have not made the summersault that we
appear to have made."
Nearly every phase, of the complicated j
liiigation had some point to be adjusted
and this brought about the general and, '
to the outsider, very interesting, if some-
What contusing contention. All matters
connected with the litigation were set for
hearing.
I Here was first the deposition of Mrs. J
Craven, interrupted at that night session
tome weeks ago, w lien the lady took ill.
fchc has remained ill ever since. Her phy- 1
Bician, Dr. C. A. Clinton, was in court to
Bay that 11 was impossible for her to be
present.
Mr. Mitchell then suggested that the
deposition be taken in the lady's home.
Mr. Delmas said he had no objection if 1
Dr. Clinton would say that she was equal 1
to the ordeal. Dr. Clinton might be con- I
suited with to-morrow about ,the matter; '
he (Delmas) had not seen hi? client for
â¢weeks.
Tne matter went over by consent to
August 17.
There was the case of Fair against
Angus to break tbe trust of the earlier j
will. That wan the matter that brought
about the collision of all the forces.- Gar
ret McEnerney, representing Mr. Good
fellow, one of the trustees unuer that early
will, led ttie charge and Dore the brunt of
the battle. He stood, he said, where he
had first taken his stand in this litigation,
and bad watched the changing position of
one phalanx and another. He movrd that
the cause be indefinitely ixstponeu. l!e
asked leave to argue the question and to
present tbe depositions of Stephen j
Roberts', Mrs. Haskius and Miss Margaret
Craven as affidavits in support of the
motion.
Charles S. Wheeler objected. He said |
the depositions cad been taksn in a dif
ferent cause and were irrelevant here.
McEnerney insisted. He said that there j
was mucli in ihe depositions that was
relevant Tney would show that the pur
pose of much of the litigation was
to destroy the capacity of Senator |
Fair's children to testify in the j
contest ot the pencil will; that
Charles S. Wheeler had said so;
also bo wished to show that Mr. Wheeler j
had made a certain contract, whereby Mrs. j
Craven's claims against the Fair estate '
were to be submitted to Richard V. Dey i
for decision as to their worth, and that the j
mru ot Â£500,000 had been agreed upon to j
be paid to her upon the express condition |
that a certain document written on both |
sides of a single sheet of paper, and which
purported to be the last will of Senator
Fair, should bu admitted to probate.
Judge SlacE allowed the depositions.
Mr. McEnerney then asked if they might
he considered as read that ha might pro
ceed with his argument.
There was considerable opposition to I
this. MoEnerney said he only needed to |
refer to fragments of the deposition, but 1
the objection being insisted upon he said
the wnole thing had better be read so as
not to miss anything.
Judge Van R. Pujerson, who represents
Herman Oelrichs *r. and other minor
heirs, took the ooeaaion of the lull in the
proceedings incident to the depositions
being broucht into court to inquire about
the demurrers to his amended opposition
to the second will. He understood it was
to be withdrawn by Mr. Lloyd, so as to
facilitate the proceedings.
Mr. L'oyd said he had expressed a
wUlingness to withdraw it only on certain
conditions.
"As lam the authority for the state
ment that you did say you would
withdraw it I would like to know what
the conditions are?" said Mr. McEnerney.
â 'Mr. Wheeler was away and I said ttatt
if he would agree I would withdraw it.
When 1 have associate counsel I never
act without consulting him."
However, it was agreed that the de
murrer should be withdrawn to simplify
matters.
"We are willing to try the second will
first," said Judge Patenon.
"Seeing that his Honor has already ao
ordered, it does not much matter who con
tents or opposes," said Delmas quietly.
"I have so ordered," said Judge Slack.
Notary Cooney was now called to the
Mund for tbe purpose of signing hii depo
sition and explaining bis dereliction in
failing to appear at the day fixed by the
court for that purpose. Mr. Cooney was
present and came promptly forward.
In answer to the court's question
ing he said he had not thought
it necessary to come into court at the time
stated, and that he had been called away.
He admitted that the court had told him
plainly ami that he had understood, but
i hat he did not attach sufficient impor
tance to the matter.
"Very well," said Judge Slack. "You
will appear 1 ere Wednesday morning to
show cause why you should not bo pun
ished for contempt."
McEnerney said be wished to ask the
witness some further questions; certain
t bings had happened since the taking of
j the deposition which he desired to know
1 about.
Delmas said the deposition was closed,;
but if it was legitimate cross-questions he
made no objections; things that had hap
pened since, however, were not admis
sible. ; â â  : â¢ . : Â
McEnerney put this question : "Did you ;
not on the completion of your deposition
on Tnuisday, July 9, disappear? 1 ' -
: Delmas immediately objected. Thiswas,
not cross-examination. The court sus
tained the objection, remarking that such
questions would be proper in|the contempt
proceedings.
"Your Honor may fine the witness for
contempt, but this" question is directed
here toward fixing the value of the depo
sition itself. If it can be snown that he
wished to evade the issue, feared to sign
I the deposition, it will serve to discredit it."
Mr. Delmas said he would advise the
wituess not to answer the question, as it
was not cross-examination, and the court
sustained him in so doing. McEfierney
then asked the same question several times
in different forms, all of which were treated
in the same manner.
Delmas now recited the circumstances
concerning the change of the attitude of
Charley Fair toward the pencil will. He
had offered it for probate once, declaring
it to be his father's last will. Then he
entered an opposition to it. Up to this
j time, however, the sisters or their at
torneys had not been served, and so far as
the record is concerned they are still with ;
the pencil will.
Heggerty said he was sure the attorneys
had been served. The record, however,
would be cleared, he said.
R. B. Mitchell read a petition giving
notice that they would ask for an order
giving permission to "inspect a certain
marriage contract alleged to be in posses
sion of Mrs. Nettie R. Craven; also a let
ter of the date of December 16, 1894, pur
porting to come from Senator Fair to Mrs.
Craven, toge'her with all the papers she |
may possess."
Mr. Delmas objected. He said these pa
pers had nothing to do with the. case at
bar, which was a suit to quiet title to real
estate. The obvious purpose of the mo
tion was to secure information belonging
10 their adversaries; to discover the
strength and weakness of thjeir case.
Their was no provision in the code for
i such a proceeding. It must be shown
I that the papers sought were necessary to
i their own case. This had not and could
not be done."
McEnerney, in reply, said that the issue
in this case was, of course, whether or not
j these papers were forgeries. He held that
! they were. It was not necessary to Know
\ whether or not Senator Fair and Mrs.
I Craven were really married. He began to
recite the series of incidents connected
I with the making of the will, when Delmas
1 interrupted him with the remark that he
was quoting fromaftid avits that were not
filed at the time the petition on which his
motion was based was dated.
The motion was withdrawn on this
i showing with the promise that it would be
, renewed to-day. With this the morning
proceedings ended.
The argument in the matter of Fair vs.
Angus was fixed for the afternoon, and
Mr. McEnerney began by the introduc
{ tion of the affidavits of Mrs. Haskins and
Margaret Craven.
Mr. Knight interrupted with the in
quiry as to whether Mr. McEnerney
would vouch for the parties, as' to whether
they were worthy of belief.
MnEnerney said he offered them simply
as affidavits. â¢
"But," said Mr. Knight, "if you do not
believe in them yourself it is an imposi
tion on this court to present them to sus- j
] tain your position. You have yourself
assailed one of these parties as I have
never before heard a woman assailed.
Now, will you say that her affidavit is
worthy of credence? . .
"It takes my breath away to hear the
attorneys on the other side challenge our I
position in this way. I stand where I
stood at the beginning of this litigation.
There is one firm here representing three
clients, one of whom is for the pencil 1
will, the others opposed to it. Other gen
tlemen who favored the pencil will are
now opposed to it. It must be
accepted, if we have any belief in pro
fessional honor, that they" were convinced
that it was a forgery; that it was not the
true will which, they at first claimed it to
be. Now eve wish to get at the facts; let
us have no more coquetting with these
two wills.. They should be compelled to I
take a stand one way or the other. As j
Mr. Wheeler said' in his open- I
ing address to the court in this
matter over a year age: 'This
case involves the most important question
that has perhaps ever come before our 1
courts. The parties td it should be made ]
to take a stand one way or the other. 'â¢ It
is a matter affecting our public morals' "
He referred caustically to the compromise
contract, and said: . "The first thing to be j
determined is as to which of thfse docu
ments is the last will of Senator Fair. If j
it is the pencil will then that ends it so I
far as we are concerned, and no one will
leave it with less regret than my client !
and myself."
Knight declared that so far as Knight & ]
Heggerty were concerned it was pretty i
well understood as to how they had always j
looked upon pencil wills and kindred
documents. As.the case went on it would
be shown they bad not turned a very
heavy somersault. He said they might j
yet join McEntrney in his position against
that document, and: be did not want him
to make the mistake of vouching for a !
witness that he (Knight) would never |
vouch for. ' .â 'â '
Reuben H. Lloyd rose up very angry at
McEnerney. "I stand here and say that it
is not true that a compromise was offered
discreditable, in any way. lam tired of I
hearing these insinuations from the other j
side. I was practicing law before he was j
horn, and I know as much about profes- j
sional honor as he does and of what is re- 1
quired between counsel and client." ,*
Wheeler also felt called upon to answer I
McEnerney's onslaught. He was more
discursive than Lloyd, however. Touch
ing "the broad question of public morals"
he wanted to know where McEnerney was
when a $300,000 proposition was made to
Mrs. Craven. '
McEnerney said that was easily disposed
of. When the representatives of Charles
Fair set up that Mrs. Craven had claims
against the estate that she would re
linquish, his client, Mr. Goodfellow, had
consented to represent the matter to the
court with recommendation in her favor.
That was Â»11.
Delmas said the only question before the
court now was. "Is this pencil will a valid
will?" He was ready to put it to the
issue. ...
Judge Paterson joined McEnerney in
asking for a postponement of the suit to
quiet title. The matter was held over !
until 11 a. M. Wednesday. â¢ ..,â¢â â

Eloquent and Forcible Address
by Ralph E. Hoyt of
Delaware.
SOME OF THE POINTS SCOEED.
Remarks by Miss Susan B. Anthony,
the Hon. James G. Maguire, J. H.
Barry and Others.
Single tax was eloquently discussed and
the cause of its advocates generously con
tributed to last night at Metropolitan
Hall, where a large number of people
gathered to listen to Ralph E. Hoyt, who
came all the way from Delaware to solicit
"We are in favor of a single standard of justice for all," said Ralph E. Hoyt
last night at Metropolitan Hall.
I
'â  funds for the campaign of the single-
I taxers now going on in that State, to the
i Hon. James G. Maguire, James H. Barry
and others. Seated among the speakers
I of the evening on the platform were Jo
seph Leggett, Miss Mary E. Hay, D. Gil
bert Dexter and others prominent in re
| form movements.
L. M. Mauzer called the meeting to
I order, stating its object was to have the
! single-tax question explaiuel by those
I who have made a close study of it and to
I secure funds for the Delaware single-tax
campaign.
"The war that we are waging," he Â«aid,
I "is a peaceful one. It depends upon moral
I force. The parties are now lining up;
j they are those who are committing whole
i sale robbery and those who are opposed
j to it."
Ralph E. lloyt was introduced, and in
slow, well-rounded sentences and clearly
enunciated words told of the progress of
the battle in the little and historic State of
Delaware. Mr. Hoyt is a man well on in
years, his hair being of a silvery white.
He spoke in part as follows:
We are not all In favor oi free silver, but we
are all In favor of free land. We are not all in
favor of a gold standard, but we are in favor
of a single standard of justice for all. We
have nothing against the gold bug or the
silver bug, but we are after the land bug, and
we will catch him, too, in the Delaware trap.
The land question closely Involves the labor
question. When the landlord is abolished the
labor questloo will be settled. Thou no one
will need to look for a job. There will be
plenty of land for every one.
A year agd the Single Tax Society decided to
concentrate its elforis in Delaware to secure
the passnge of & single-tax law there.
Three or four years aero an experiment was
I tried in the town of HyattsviUe. Taxes were
j removed from personal and improved pro p-
I ertv, and enough was added to the land to
I make up the deficiency. It worked most favor
ably. More money was spent during tbe next
year for improvements than for any preceding
year. At tbe end ot a year the Supreme Court
of the State declared this single-tax law un
constitutional, and the next year improve
ments fell off to a most remarkable extent.
The chairman of the town trustees of Hyatts
vi lie was lUe one who suggested the present
campaign in Delaware, and this led to the
present movement In that State.
Single tax is not socialism nor anarchy.
It is i:ot too late to abolish this present
gigantic evil of taxationâ the mother of all
grinding and oppressive monopolies. Nature
lormed no statute of limitations. The time has
come for its abolition. Let us abolish It by the
single tax.
About sixteen yean ago a proclamation was
issue.; by a man in the far West lv this very
City of San Francisco. He called his proclama
tion "Progress and Poverty." It has since
been printed In all the languages of civiliza
tion aud has been read by millions of people.
To-day all true singie-taxers everywhere
throughout this land are sacredly pledged to
stand by that proclamation.
James H. Barry spoke of the blessings
that would result from the adoption of the
single tax.
"Under right conditions," hp said,
"every invention should be a blessing, but
under existing conditions it is a curse, as
it throws men out of employment every
where; and the more surplus labor you
have tne more readily can yon enslave it.
With the single tax in operation no man
will need to be out of employment, for
there will then be ample field for his
labors."
James A. Reynolds followed in a brief
appeal fo' funds and succeeded in gather
ing in nearly $200.
Congressman Maguire started the con
] tribution with a $20 piece and Mr. Rey-
I nolds followed suit. James H. Bnrry, M.
| Ross of Petaluma and Benjamin Johnson
!of Copperoi<olis each contributed $10.
I Chairman Manzer, Joseph Leggett and
j two others each dortate'd $5, ana then a
I collection was taken up by passing
around the hat.
Susan B. Anthony, who had a seat on
the platform, made an appeal for votes for
the eleventh amendment, striking out the
word '"male" from the constitution, and
met with a cordial reception.
Congressman Maguire then spoka as fol
lows:
Of all reforms to be accomplished I hold sin
gle tax to be first, because it will establish the
complete independence of mankind and en
able him to work out his own salvation.
No matter what arguments may appeal to
others to give suffrage'to the woman, no self
ish argument need be made to the slngie-tax
eri. We do not ask how they will vote; all we
! desire to know is that they are right.
In the Delaware campaign the initial strug
gle for industrial emancipation is now. being
made. Everywhere I find a feeling of unrest
among the people of the United States -a de
sire to fine something that will relieve them
from their present troubles. Industrial eman
cipation cannot come until man has free and
equal access to the natural resources stored
up in the earth. No reform can accomplish
that resuit except the single tax, which will
strike down the barrier that stands between
the people and their natural opportunities.
Grand Jury Did >'ot Meet.
The United States Grand Jury was to have
been formally sworn in yesterday, but when
the time arrived it was found that too many
had been excused. In addition to this P. B.
Cornwall, Charles Kohler and F. McKee Stock
ing were absent, Judge Morrow promptly hold
ing them in contempt of court. The Marshal
was instructed to bring the derelict jurors in to
court on Friday next. A special venire of
twenty-five was also ordered.

ploye in Buckingham & Hecht'sshoe factory,
was alighting irom a Castro-street car last
night at Eleventh and Market streets when he

HYDRAULIC MINERS.
An Interesting Keport From T. X>.
Ford Upon Late Congres
sional Hills.
An interesting meeting of the executive
board of the California Miners 1 Associa
tion was held last evening, and those
present were: J. H. Neff, president ; A.
Carrlngton, secretary pro lem. ; W. W.
Montague, Dan T. Cole, Professor Christy,
S. J. Hendy, Hon. Grove L. Johnson, E. C.
Voorheis, E. H. Benjamin, S. K. Thorn
ton, H. T. Power, Felix Cnappelet, J. J.
Crawford, J. W. Wright, Thomas R.
Church, Tirey L. Ford, J. M. Thomas and
Judge J. F. Davis.
Nearly the whole session was consumed
in listening to the Hon. Tirey L. Ford,
who went to Washington in the early
part of the year to represent the interests
of tbe California hydraulic miners before
Congress. In his report Mr. Ford stated
that the bill intended to reduce the penal
ties provided in the Caminetti act
was not passed. The bill intended
to amend the Federal mining laws
was temporarily neglected, but it may pass
at a future date. The mineral lands bill
also failed to pass, owing to parliament
ary technicalities which made its continu
ance necessary to the next Congress.
However, Mr. Ford and the California
delegation and friends in other parts of
the United States did succeed in securing
the passage of an appropriation bill for
$25X000 for tbe construction of debris-
Impounding dams in several of tbe tribu
taries of the largo navigable streams of
California.
It was decided to hold the next conven
tion of the California Miners' Association
on the second Tuesday in November.
SCHOOL OF DESIGN.
Opening; of the Fall Termâ Success of the
Night Class Assured.
The fall term of tbe School of Design of
the Ban Francisco Art Association opened
yesterday under favorable auspices. The
term this season opens two weeks earlier
than usual, and no doubt many of the
students will not report until the middle
of trie month.
The enrollment yesterday shows a repre
sentation of pupils, not only from Cali
fornia, but from other States of the Pa
cific Coast.
The directors of the association are
highly gratified overÂ«the assured success oi
the night class Already forty students
have been enrolled and twenty-seven at
tended the school iaÂ»t night.
This class is conducted by John Stanton.
He urged its establishment on tbe board
of trustees, and is very confident that it
will become popular. In the work of pre
paring for the reception of this class the
directors have extended encouragement to
Mr. Stantan. The opening last night was
exceedingly agreeable to the teacher.
"Wall Street and Gold.
George H. Sullivan of the Wall-street law
firm of Sullivan & Cromwell is at the Palace.
His father is attorney for the bondholders of
the Northern Pacific Railroad and Is now in
the Northwest on business connected with
that road. Mr. Sullivan arrived here last
night from the orange and lemon country
near Loe Angeles, where he has been arrang.
iug some private business that prompted this
his first visit to California. He- says tbat
wherever he has been he has noticed that the
men who have been successful in businessâ the
men who may on that account be locked upon
as timtncial expertsâ are all in favor of a gold
standard. On the other hand, those inexpe
rienced in large business enterprises and un
successful in small ones waju silver. The
same people, he declare*, imagine that in ot>-
Eosiug gold they are opposing an element that
as its life only in Wail street. Whereas a ma
jority of the operations by the brokers in that
street are the direct result of telegraphic or
ders from stock aud bond-holders all over the
country. So, in opposing Wall street, a man
may be fighting against his next-door neigh
bor.
A BARTENDER'S GOOD LOCK.
Adolph Nothbaar Is the Heir
to a Large Fortune in
Germany.
Adolph Nothbaar, a bartender at the
New Louvre at 14 O'Farrell street, was
yesterday notified by tbe German Consul
that he had fallen heir to a large estate in
Germany. The windfall consists of 450,
-000 marks, which comes to the bartender
through the death of an uncle in Father
land.
There Is also a prospect of Nothbawr
falling heir to a fortune of 1,000,000 marks
frcm a relative in Austria. The lucky
man is 52 years of age, and married and
he has several children.
His wife has some roeans in her own
right. The family live at 537 Stevenson
street. Some time ago Nothbaar was
the proprietor of the old Kathskiller
saloon on Turk and Market streets before
that place became the Thalia. He has
since been employed as a plain bartender.
Years ago he was the proprietor of a saloon
in Oakland. Nothbaar states that he will
return to Germany at once and take pos
session of his property, which, however,
he will have to share with his only rela
tive, a sister.
ALMA JOSSELYN DYING.
Dr. Marten Writes Her a Letter Plan-
ning a Flight From tbe Chief
of Police.
Alma Josselyn, the young woman who
lays all the suffering of her blighted
existence to the mesmeric glitter of Dr.
Marten's restless orbs, lies on the death
couch, with the moist imprint of the grim
specter on her brow.
Her physician, Dr. Logan, states that in
his opinion hardly forty-eight hours will
have elapsed ere the soul of the un
fortunate girl is ferried across the Stygian
River.
Her father appeared pale and worn last
night, and said that with a single excep
tion all her relatives had been sent for to
be present at the last hour.
In the meantime Svengali Marten sits
in his cell and concoct.s schemes to regain
his former influence over her. Two days
ago he sent a note to a friend requesting
that an inclosed letter be Bmuggled to her.
The epistle is indited in a microscopic
hand, and recalls to mind a dream she
had in which he appeared in the grasp of
the Chief of Police. He admits that the
dream has materialized, but says he will
soon be released on a writ of ha
beas corpus, and asks her to meet him at
a date to be named later. Then he will
have a carriage in waiting and will bear
her away from the scene of their troubles.
The news that she is dying greatly
shocKed him and he is now writing imag
inary prescriptions in the air to woo her
back to life and health.
COMPROMISED A CONTEST.
L Tlie Widow of Charles D. Root Settles
With His Divorced Wife.
The contest of the will of Charles D.
Root was yesterday compromised in Judge
Coffey's court.
The case was a somewhat peculiar one.
Mr. Root was married twice. The first
marriage was an unhappy one and re
sulted in a divorce. A short time after
the separation a child was born to the
first wife, which child Mr. Root never
saw. The result of the second marriage
was a little girl, now 18 months old. The
contest of the will was brought by the first
wife in behalf of her child.
It seems that when the original Mrs.
Root was divorced the court allowed her
$25 per month for maintenance of the
child. Five months after the divorce was
granted she was married to a man named
Brown, who has always been regarded by
the child as his father.
Mr. Root in his will made provision for
the continuance of the monthly payment
for the support of his child by the first
marriage and left the balance of the estate
to his second wife. Mrs. Brown was not
satisfied with the provision made for her
child and so contested the will,
The case was settled by what was vir
tually a compromise. Mrs. Brown in
addition to the $25 per month was al
lowed $3000 in cash. A jury was formally
summoned and went through the legal
form of awarding that amount to the con
testant.
The entire estate is worth about $75,000.

REV, DR. BROWNSON
CREATES A STORM,
His Paper on the Bible in
Schools Evokes Caustic
Comment.
SABBATH OBSERVANCE.
Dr. Willey Demands That the
European Method Be Dis
couraged.
SOME VACATION EXPERIENCES.
Reception to Dr. Callendar and Wife
Who Are Going as Missionaries
to China.
Yesterday's session of the Baptist Min
isterial Society was signalized by a ripple
of excitement seldom permitted to disturb
the smooth waters of their discussion. At
one time, in fact, the ripple threatened to
swell in volume and become a storm wave,
but a little verbal oil was poured upon the
surface of the deep and the impending
calamity was averted.
It all came about on account of the orig
inal and startling statements in a paper
read by Rev. T. G. Brownson, the new
president of the California Baptist College.
The title of the paper was, "Oueht the
Bible to .have a Prominent Place in Bap
tist Schools?"
President Brownson introduced his sub
ject by noting that in every Baptist schoo
tne course of study covers three or four
years. He thought that the Bible ought
to have at least a full year as a complete
study, and that to graduate from a Bap
list school of whatever grade a full year of
BiDle study should be required.
In proof of this he went on to say that a
careful study of the word stimulates intel
lectual development, that as a book of
thought it is masculine and vigorous, and
t' at in every century and every com
munity tbose men who have itudied tbe
Bible have attained a higher intellectual
development than those 01 more advanced
education who have neglected such study.
The Scriptures he also believed to assist
tbe student in acquiring a clear, soccmct
and forceful English style.
With reeret he mentioned the dense
ignorance of the average person of the
beauties contained in the O!d and New
Testaments and the intellectual as well
as spiritual good they Jo<t thereby.
Then it was that Dr. Brownson oegan to
dissert on the subjects that aroused many
of his brethren to dissent. They were in
connection with the competency of divines
to elucidate the Bible and its use in sec
ular and religious schools.
"The public schools," he asserted, "give
the pupil a smattering of everything and
teach aim nothing.
"He can neither read nor write and is
seriously defective in arithmetic, while
spelling is worse to him than a foreign
tongue.
"The average high school does not at
UU Murphy Building, /
Market and Jones Streets;
tempt to master anything. This is not its {
â¢ ambition. Its ambition is to cram enough j
knowledge into the cranium of the student |
' to admit him to the university, and the {
, university is adding one branch after an
other to its admittance rrquirements. !
This year it is more Latin, next year it is
a full year devoted to physics, the year :
after that it is something else.
''With such overcrowded conrses of
study how shall there be found room to
add the Bible?"
After further dilation npon the study of !
the Bible in the schools, he took up the !
question of the competency of ministers:
of the Baptist denomination to teach its j
truths.
"There are not twenty-fire Baptists in
the United States," he declared, "who are
fitted to teach the Bible to college ?tu
dents. Their knowledge of the book must j
be the knowledge secured by a long course ;
of intense and exhaustive study under the i
guidance of a master.
"We have no such men. lam tola that
Stanford University is ready to establish a
chair of Bible study and has been ready
for several years, but it cannot find a man
fitted for the position.
"Startling as may be the statements it is
nevertheless true that there are no men in j
the Baptist denomination who are fitted
to teacn the Bible in a Baptist school of
any grade below the theological semi- j
nary."
Hardly had President Brownson taken
his seat when the discussion of the paper 1
was started by Rev. Dr. Sunderland, who !
took issue with the statement in regard to I
the twenty-five men competent to make I
plain Scriptural truths. lie thought there ;
were plenty ot' men endowed lÂ»y nature i
with sufficient intellectuality, supple- j
mented with the scholarship necessary to 1
render '.hem proficient in teaching the I
Scriptures anywhere in theworld.
Next Rev. C. H. Hobart spoke to the j
paper. He said that if the twenty-five j
men mentioned were multiplied by twen- |
ty-five and that product by twenty-tive I
again, it would express more nearly the
true number. He believed there are as I
many men in the ministry competent to ;
teach the Bible as there are in any other
profession. Moreover, Â»vhile he did not
care to contradict President Brownson. he 1
thought there must be some mistake about |
the inability to secure a proper man to
teach the Bible at Stanford University.
Rev. M. P. Boynton also objected to the
paper. He wanted the author to tell him
why it was that if the great mass of the
people were so ignorant on the subject of
Sacred Writ men were required to Jtnow
so much to teach them.
Rev. Mr. Hlli thought there were hun
dreds of men scholarly enough to teach
the book.
Rev. D. Abbott added fresh fuel to the
blaze by rising and stating with much j
emphasis that lie not only believed the 1
ministers of every denomination in the
United States incompetent as teachers,
but that the estimate of twenty-five com
petent men was much too high.
Rev. Mr. Teech at once replied that both
President Brownson ar.d the Rev. Mr. Ab
bott were surely mistaken. He said it j
would give him sorrow to be obliged to 1
accept their statements as founded on
fact.
Rev. Mr. Whittaker was disposed to look
at President Brownson's statements in a
softer iight. He was inclined to think
that the assertions mustjjave been made I
in regard to instructors along technical i
lines. Otherwise he could not accept them
either.
In defense of nis paper, President
Brownson rose and said that, while a min
ister could make any statement he pleased
lrom the pulpit without fear of questions
or contradiction, when it carae to teaching
students, that was a vastly different mat
ter. Then all sorts of questions would be ;
fired at him, some of them skeptical, some
for broader information, and some which
would require a thorough knowledce of
disputed points and of biblical history.
At this meeting it was also made known J
that the California Baptist College will j
liave its opening service, next Wednesday ;
at 9a. m., with the following programme: I

, At. the meeting of the Congregational
Monday Club Rev. William Rader of the ;
Third Congregational â  Church gave his
vacation experiences. These included a
visit to the Sunday School convention in
Tremont Temple, Boston, and the Chris
tian Endeavor Convention in Washing
ton.
Dr. Francis Rader,, in his address to the
Christian Endeavorers at Washington,
the speaker thought, struck the keynote of
the deepening of spiritual life. Other
lecturers had laid the greatest emphasis
on civic reform. .
Dr. McLean gave a pleasant account of
his vacation trip to Mount Shasta, and
was followed by Evangelist John Currie,
who dwelt on Ms intended plan of having a
wagon and traveling from town to town
in the rural districts, preaching the Gos
pel. -3&m%
In the absence of the president Dr.
Nelson presided at the Methodist Episco- :
pal preachers' meeting, and Rev. F. X. ;
Baker was elected secretary pro tern pore.
The devotions were conducted by Dr.
Willey, founder of the Howard , Presby
terian Church, and. late of Benicia. idfis
address was devoted mainly to methods
of promoting the proper observance of the
Sabbath.
Dr. S. D. Slmonds read a very interest
ing paper on "Reminiscences of Mount
Shasta District." Ti e paper sparkled with
wit and humor, and evoked high praise.
He was requesteu to publish it in the Cali
fornia Christian Advocate. Ail the events
noted ; occurred in 1857, : and the travels
were ail made on mules. - .
Drs. E. R. Dille, W. W. Case and W. d.
Urmy were appointed a committee to con
aider the matter presented by Dr. Diile.
At the Presbyterian ministers' meeting
it was "quiz" day. Rev. Mr. Jenks, as
sistant castor of the First Presbyterian
Church, was "quizmaster.'.' The first
question was, ''Snail the midweek services
be led by pastors or people ?â¢' â¢ .'
The only answer : was delivered by Rev.
F. A. Doaue, . who ; thought â  the pastor
should always be present to direct the ex
ercises, which should occasionally be led
by a layman or an elder.
, The most important of all the queries
propounded was, "How can Sunday-even
ing services be made efficient?." Dr. Mm- 1
ton of.the Presbyterian Theological Bern- i
mary at San Anselmo answered that the
interest did not always center in the intel
lectuality or personality of the pastor, but
frequently in the surroundines. > He did
not approve of a series of services, but be
lieved them wearisome both to the pastor
and his flock. In addition, he suggested
that trite themes should be studiously
avoided and questions of current interest
discussed.
, Rev. J. Camming* Smith spoke to the
same question. The size of the audience i
cut little figure in his estimation so long !
as tue persons present were led to lead
better Christian lives. He would treat de
nominational questions in the morning
and lighter themes in the evening. â¢
Rev. Mr. Perry /of Ban ; Leand ; would
give good music a prominent part in the
evening services, and Dr. C. C. Herriott
thought it would be a good thing to have
systematic Bible instruction at that time.
A reception was also given yesterday at
the Presbyterian Mission to the Rev. C. R.
Collendar and wife, who are going as mis
sionaries fto Laos, China,* 1 next Saturday.

THE LAST CALL OF
MESSENGER "23."
Arthur McKenna's Death
From Quick Con
sumption.
BURIED BY COMRADES.
Their Noble Endeavor to Help
the Lad During His Last
Illness.
A PATHETIC HEADSTONE.
It Has B-ren Erected by the Boys of
Ijhe American District Tele
graph Company.
Messenger "23" is dead.
Excepting the sorrow in the hearts of
his little comrades and the kind words
spoken of him by his immediate superiors
there is nothing but a plfin headstone in
Holy Cross Cemetery to indicate that a
frolicsome lad hes passed away.
No crepe was strung in graceful festoons
over the entrances to the various Ameri
can District Telegraph Company's offices
when Arthur McKenna died. Displays of
that kind are made when some of the big
ones breathe their last and the doors of
the offices are closed, giving the employes
an opportunity for an extra holiday, the
penalty of which is only a dollar or two
forctch man's shr re of some magnificent
floral piece.
It is so different in the case of Messen
ger "23."
His coffin, a simple affair, was laden
with flowers, it is true; but they were tiny
bunches of roses, hyacinths, sweet peas
and nasiurliums, purchased with nickels
and dimes. Each bunch was an individ
ual offering, given witn friendly hand and
watered with a tear. There were no
mammoth pieces with inlaid sentiments,
which the florist is supposed to know how
to frame according to the size of the note
with which the purchase ia made.
The messenger boys of the American
District Telegraph Company had better
use lor their money than to make a dis
play. Their little comrade had died an
orphan, without means and no one to look
out for him but themselves and his
brother William, whose devotion at his
bedside during many tedious weeks
of illness proved him to be possessed of
that strong and feeling nature that makes
a man.
This death of Arthur McKenna has
brought out one phase of the meÂ«senger
boy that has not attracted much attention
heretofore. He has generally been re
garded as a harum-scarum, shiftless lad,
whose love of ?elf, ciearettes and yellow
backed novels were divided in equal parts
at an inverse ratio 10 his ability to be slow
in delivering messages.
Well, ii he will smoke a cigarette, if he
will read trashy novels, and if he will dis

appoint the message-sender by not using
wings, there is one thing in which he is
not slow and thnt is in lettinr his heart ;
go out to his comrade, especially if he is
suffering and is in need, i
Many months ago, Arthur McKenna,
fatherless, motherless, contracted the first
cold that paved his way to the grave. Re
! turning Irom delivering a message,
j cirenched by the ram and no tender hands
' to care for him, he lay down in his little j
cot in a dingy room in one of the dark
alleys of this City. The next day he was
stricken with pneumonia.
His brother, William, only a couple of j
years his senior, nursed him through that
illness, the other messenger-boys in the
office furnishing the sinews of war to meet
the doctor and the medicine bills.
When Arthur was convalescent the boys
I collected $20 among themselves and each
gave his mite with a will to send him to
Vacaville. Subsequent subscriptions were
raised to keep the boy in the country for
three weeks and furnish him with all the
necessaries of life. But the disease bad
made too great inroads on his system.
Consumption camo next. Quick consump
tion it was at that and there was little
hope that he could recover.
The boy was brought back and placed in
a private hospital in this City, where hs
died last Frida'v morning.
Immediately the little fellows m the
missenger office got up another subscrip
tion to bury their comrade, and out of
their scanty earnings they raised $49 25.
Colonel O'Connor, the undertaker, took
charge of the remains, and had the amount
been three-fold that, the remains of the
motherless child could not have been
better cared for.
It is not likely that those people who have
from time to time left the extra dime in
tt^e palm of a messenger-boy's hand will
regret their donation wben they pass
through Holy Cross Cemetery and read
this headstone:

MORE MONEY FOR THE PARK.
As the Schedule Now Stands the Rate
Will Be Raised Six and a
Half Cents.
The Board of Supervisors made a suffi
cient number of alterations in the report
of the Finance Committee on municipal
appropriations yesterday to raise the tax
levy from $1 05, as recommended by the
committee, to $1 11%, and the indications
are that the end is not yet, for there are
still many sections and departments to be
heard from.
The main item that occasions the raise
is the appropriation of $200,000 to build a
high school in the Mission. The raising
of the estimates began as soon as the
report of the Finance Committee was read.
Supervisor Benjamin, who is a member
of the committee, a^ked that the estimate
for Golden Gate Park be raised from $225,
-000 to $250,000. He said that the park
was the pride and boaÂ«t of San Francisco
and that the money was needed.
Supervisor Dimond wanted the matter
of the appropriations put over until the
date on which the levy was actually to be
fixed.
Supervisor Wagner supported him, say
ing that he was not ready to vote on the
levy yet, as he intended to offer a resolu
tion apportioning $150,000 for tne repaying
of Market street from the ferries to Six
teenth street. When a vote was taken on
the question of raising the park appro
priation the measure was opposed by
Hobbs, Dunker, Dimond, Taylor and
Hir.-ch, but carried by a vote of 7in favor
of it.
In explaining his vote in the negative
Supervisor Taylor stated that he believed
the money appropriated last year, $300,
-000, had been expended in an extravagant
manner, and that while he believed in im
proving and beautifying the park he
thought it was time tb put a stop to tne
reckless expenditure of the people's money.
"Begin by ignoring tlie figures of the
Finaiice Committee that were based on
careful investigation and consultation,"
he said, "and the result will be that there
will be raises all along the line, and in
stead of the low levy we aimed at we will
have one that will greatly displease the
Deople whose servants we are."
The vote had hardly been announced
when Supervisor Wagner arose and moyed
that an appropriation of $150,000 be in
cluded in the report for the paving of Mar
ket street.
He stated that the appropriation of that
amount would only mean an increase of
4' 2 cents in the tax rate and that the peo
ple of San Francisco would willingly pay
that for so great an improvement.
His only supporters were Benjamin and
King.
Then Mr. Hobbs, to show that the in
terests of his constituents were not neg
lected, moved that $200,000 for a new high
school building in the Mission be provided
for in the levy.
He was apparently somewhat surprised
when six of his colleagues â King, Scully,
Hirsch, Benjamin, Morgenstem and Wag
nerâsupported him and carried the mo
tion.
Tne increase for the Health Department
that was asked created a little storm, dur
ing which the department 'was pretty
roughly handled by Supervisor Taylor.
Supervisor Spreckels championed the
cause of the department, stating that
he believed that the department was
one of the most important in the
City eovernment and that he believed
it should have $10,000 more than the com
mittee had allowed for it, or $35,000 in all.
Supervisor Taylor showed that the de
partment had already been allowed $33,000
instead of $25,000, as Supervisor Snreckels
seemed to think, and that the department
had been given $7000 more than last year.
He picked the Health Department com
munication to the board to pieces, par
ticularly the contention that additional
inspectors were needed to keep a check on
those already employed. He said that the
people might just as well elect twelve new
Supervisors to keep a watch on those al
ready in office. â¢He ridiculed the Board of
Health and said he did not believe they
had read the communication before send
ing it.
The matter was finally compromised by
allowing the department $2000 more than
the estimate furnished by the Finance
Committee, or a total of $9000 more than
last year.
Supervisor King wanted the department
allowed an additional $10,000 for four food
inspection stations, but there was no sec
ond to his motion.
This closed the raises for the day, but
Supervisor Benjamin moved to pass a reso
lution previously submitted pledging the
board to carry out the policy outlined by
Finance Committee in its report, so that
there is still time for more increases. The
total increase was $227,000, or 63^ cents on
the $100.
The report of the Finance Committee
was in part as follows:
Your committee begs leave to submit for the
careful and unprejudiced consideration of our
citizens that while many improvements have
been urged, and which under different circum
stances ought to have been provided for, it
must be borne in mind that the general good
must predominate, and it appears to your
committee that an excessive tax levy in a pe
riod of depression as is at present being ex
perienced by our merchants, business
men and property-owners, would be a
great hardship bearing oppressively on all our
citizens. These reasons, important as they
are, could not be overlooked, and led your
committee to recommend as light & tax rate as
could consistently be made in view of tne fact
that our Supreme Court has determined it to
be the duty ot the levying power to provide
sufficient funds, exercising reasonable and
proper discretion for the expenditures of the
government.
In the performance of this duty It is to be
regretted that many of the appropriations
made to departments are not controlled,
kept within the appropriations made, and
thus creating an indebtedness which cannot
always be foreseen, which is seemingly bound
to occur until courts can determine that be
yond the appropriation made therefor no de
partment can expend a greater amount than
provided for it.
This subject and the evils of the system now
prevailing and allowed have been reported on.
time and time again, and no remedy has yet
been evolved to check and prevent such out
lays.
The resolutions to be introduced will pre
sent the result of your committee's labor,
showing the purposes and the several appro
priations made therefor, and which in the ex
ercise of economy, of the power vested in the
board to control the same, should have re
sulted in nihii y reductions being made. As it
is, the power has been exercised so as to show
that a discretion has been used to provide suf
ficient and reasonable appropriations to meet
all expenditures.
As many of our departments and citizens
have impressed the committee with their views
on many public requirements, it is but just to
state that but for the conditions existing
these requirements would have been provided
for. Among many none appealed to your
committee more Btrongly than the ap
propriation asked for a high school building
at the Mission, but as the appropriation for
the School Department was $1,000,000 your
committee could not see its way cleai to add
$200,000 to the levy this year for that purpose,
although it ia conceded a high school should
be located in that section of our City. Your
committee was not unanimous in tne matter,
as Supervisor Hobbs was urgent as to the ne
cessity of providing his constituents with their
demand for higher educational facilities.
The importance of carrying out the improve
ments and preserving those already made in
Golden Gate Park appealed to your committee,
and after due consideration the sum of
$225,000 was allowed. Supervisor Benjamin,
while dissenting to the amount, was willing to
allow $250,000.
The attention cf your committee was called
to the action of the Grand Jury In determining
that the sum of $84,000 was a sufficient appro
priation for the conduct of the County Clerk's
department in the payment of salaries, and
with that view your committee coincides and
have fixed the appropriation at that amount.

A resolution was adopted allowing Com
pany L, First Regiment Infantry National
Guard, to give a boxing and wrestling ex
hibition at its armory, corner of Gough
and Page streets, during September. The
company is expected to pay the license of
$100, but it is exempted from the $135 con
tribution to the Robinson bequest fund
that is demanded of the boxing clubs.
The Superintendent of Streets was in
structed to issue an assessment for the cost
of laying plank sidewalks three feet wide
on California street, between First and
Thirteenth avenues, and on LaKe street,
between Fourth and Thirteenth avenues.
The Hicks-Judd Company sent in a
bill for $2U67 10 for printing fifty copies of
the transcript on appeal in the Durrant

by a special resolution.
The board then adjourned until Mon
day, September 21, the time for the an
nual vacation having arrived.

A PLEASANT OUTING.
Colonel M>ntnn's Kxcursion to Santa
Cruz a Great Success.
Colonel Menton's excursion over the
narrow-gauge line to Santa Cruz last Sun
day was a success in every way. It was
largely attended by a most respectable
crowd â so largely in fact tnat no Jess than
twenty-two cars were needed to accom
modate all the excursionists, and these
had to be made up into two trains.
A most enjoyable day was spent in Santa
Cruz, and every one returned home in
good time. The excursion was under the
personal direction of Colonel Menton.
Protecting Home Goods.
The Iron-molders at their meeting last night
appointed a committee to co-operate with
similar bodies from other organizations for
the consumption of domestic-made cigars and
beer.
The same union referred the communication
sent to it favorir.R the adoption of the new
charter to the delegates of its body for a report
before acting thereon.

WOMEN'S TRUST
Charles Holman,With Many
Aliases, Again in
Trouble.
FORGERY IS CHARGED.
He Gave Mrs. Rose Kamaroni
Forged Checks to Get Money
From Her.
A SWINDLER OF THE LADIES
Has Served Two Terms in the State
Prison and Been Arrested
Several Times.
A man witn a large number of aliases
who has for years swindled women by
representing himself as a wealthy miner
or rancher and malting a pretense of want
ing to marry them is once more locked up
in tie City Prison on a charge of forgery.
His real name is supposed to be Charies
Hoiman, a native of Maine, 55 years of
age. His aliases, so far as known to the
police, are Llewellyn Miller, R. N. Saun
ders, S. P. Danforth, J. Garfield, Arthur
.Arlington. J. J. Allen and J. B. Brown.
He is nearly 6 feet tail and weighs about
220 pounds.
The complaining witness on the present
charge of forgery is Mrs. Rose Kainaroni,
an accoucheuse, living at 51 Fifth street.
On April 20 last, while she was living at
786% Harrison street, Holman called upon
her and introduced himself as Arthur Ar
lington, a wealthy miner.
Mrs. Hankatzi, a friend living at 413}^
Broadway, was with Mrs. Kaniaroni at the
time.
Holman said he wanted to talk privately
with Mrs. Kamaroni, but she explained to
him she could not speak good English
and called in Mrs. Hankatzi, whom
she introduced as her sister, although
she was not; but she was afraid Hol
man would not talk so freely before
a stranger. Holman then said he
had a girl friend, who had cot into trou
ble and he would pay Mrs. Kamaroni well
if she would perform a criminal operation
upon her. Mrs. Kamaroni demurred, but
said that she would care for tne girl dur
ing her trouble. He consented to this
and after looking at two rooms engaged
tnem, saying the girl would call next day.
As an evidence of good faith he wrote
the following on a sheet of paper:
To Crocker, Woolwcrth & Co.: Pay to Rose
Kumaroni, 786J^ .Harrison street, the sum of
t"o thousand and five hundred dollars
(Â£2500). Fay this check to bearer.
J. M. Cabson.
San Francisco, April 20, 1896.
Before Holman took his derjarture he
did something to arouse Mrs. Kamaroni's
suspicions. Her pocket-book was on the
table in the room where they were talking.
She had occasion to leave the room for a
few minutes, and when she returned 6he |
saw him with the pocket-book in hia hand
examining its contents. She made him
return it to her, and he did not offer any
apology or explanation for his conduct,
Mrs. Kamaroni went to tbe Crocker
â \Voolworth Bank next day and presented
the order. She was told no such person as
"J. M. Carson" had an account in the
bank. She immediately went to police
headquarters and Captain Lees detailed
Detective Anthony on the case.
Anthony went to Mrs. Kamaroni's house,
fig Holman had promised to return that
night. He waited for some hours, but Hol
man did not turn up, and he left. He had
oniy been gone half au hour when Holman
made his appearance. She told him that
the order was refused by the bank, and he
faid he had forgot to deposit his money
there, but to put things right he wrote out
three checks on the DonolioeKelly Bank
for $5000, $50 and $10. respectively, pay
able to lier and signed 'J. M. Carson,"
and said they were all good.
They talked for some time and finally he
proposed marriage to her. She gave "him
an evasive answer and then he asked her
for some money as he was short of ready
CHARIES HOLMAN. CHARGED WITH FORGERY.
coin just for the moment. He was, he
said, stopping at the Licit House, and he
would return the money next day. She
wag suspicious of him and asked him to
write his name on a piece of lyellow'paper.
He wrote "J. M. Carson, White House,
Kearny and Po-t streets." He did not
leave till after midnight.
Holman called the following day and
asked if the girl had come. Mrs. Kama
roni replied in the negative and Holman
asked her for the loan of 60 cents, which
she declined to eive him. He went away
and she did not see him again till Satur
day night. She saw him on Grant avenue
and walked behind him till she met Police
man Smith Carr, who j. laced lum under
arrest. He was very saucy and indignant,
but Cart insisted upon takinar him before
Captain Wittman. Tien Captaiu Lees
was notified and he at once recognised
Holman and ordered him locked up pend
ing an investigation. He was booked
yesterday,
Holman is an ex-convict, having served
two terms iÂ» San Quentin. On August
28, 1882, he got five years for grand larceny.
He was sent from Sacramento County,
where he hired a woman as housekeeper,
shipped her trunks to this City and sold
tbeir contents. On April 4, 1887, he was
sentenced in this City to ten years for
swindling Mrs. Johanna Carlson out of
$145, and was discharged on October 8,
1893.
He next got himself into trouble in Oak
land about a year ago. He made the ac
quaintance of a young widow, proposed
marriage to her, and so won her confi
dence that she pave him $1000. He left
her, saying he was going to Nevada to
settle up some business, and when be re
turned they would be married. He did
not return and she notified the police. J.
J. Allen, as he then called himself, was
arrested, and to avoid prosecution re
turned the $1000.
After this escapade he went to San Jose,
hired a housekeeper and swindled her out
of $45. He was arrested but the case fell
through as the woman bad to admit she
loaned him the money. He was imme
diately arrested by Detective? Gibson and
Reynolds on a warrant from this C'ty,
charging him with felony embezzlement.
That was on November 30 last. He was
charged with emb zzling a diamond pin
worid $100 which he had got from Miss
Lulu Patterson. He was held to answer,
but when the case came for trial in the
Superior Court it was dismissed as the
woman had got back her diamond pin.
In speaking of the charge of forgery,
Holman said yesterday that he did not re
member anytning about it as he was al
ways drunk when he saw Mrs. Kaniaroni.
The four checks which he gave her are
in the possession of Captain Lees.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 4, 1596.
SCHEMER MASON
HAS A RECORD,
Served Eighteen Months in
Nevada Prison for Bur
glary.
HE SWINDLED CONVICTS
Secured Valuable Hand- Made Ar
ticles, but Failed to Make
Any Returns.
MASON IS FINALLY EXPOSED.
Used the United States Mails for
Fraudulent Purposes and Was
Caught.
Inspect<*-in-Charee Munro received yes
terday information which will probably
materially assist in bringing about the
conviction of Edward Mason, arrested in
Colusa last week on a charge of using tbe
mail for fraudulent purposes.
It will be remembered that some time in
April last Mason wrote to Mrs. Margaret
Cbristie of Warebara, Mass., to the effect
that her son had been seriously injured in
a railway accident and was anxious to re
turn home. If Mrs. Christie would send
the sum of $100, he, Mason, would see
young Christie safely aboard the cars en
route for Boston town. The letter was
written from Truckeeand signed by Mason
as Sheriff of the county.
In time a postoffice order for the amount
named reached Mason, who immediately
brushed the dust of Truckee from his feet
and hied 1 imself to Colusa. From that
point he wrote to Mrs. Christie's daughter
in Boston, repeating the story told the
mother, ending with a request for $65.
The daughter and Bister, however, was not
so easily taken in. She made a thorough
investigation, with the result that Mason
was arrested, as told above.
It now develops that young Mason was
born near Wareham, Mass.. where the
Christies reside. He left home when
about 20 years old, finally drifting to
Nevada. In 1894 he was arrested on a
charge of burglary, convicted and sen
tenced to the Nevada Btate prison for a
term of eighteen months. He was released
last January, going directly to Truckee.
Fora time Mason managed to make a
comfortable living out of his former asso
ciates, the convicts. They sent him many
valuable trinkets to be sold on commis
sion. He disposed of the articles but
failed to make returns to the proper par
ties. When this scheme had about played
itself out Mason bethought himself of
other questionable ways to make a living.
One day he heard that Everett Christie of
Wareham, Mass., was in California, and
what was more to his purpose, that the
New Englander was not on Inendly terms
with his family.
His earlier knowledge of the famllv
made him in a sense master of the situ
ation. He played on the love of the
mother to the tune of $100, and then tried
the sarn-j game on the sister and daugh
ter. It is the old story of the pitcher, and
on Friday n j xt Mason will appear 111 the
New York District Court to answ.er to a
charge of using the mails for fraudulent
purposes. The postal authorities are con
fident of a conviction.
A CARNIVAL BEFORE LENT.
The Committee Believes That
Such a Time Would Be
Most Suitable.
A strong sentiment in favor of holding
tbe Carnival of tne Golden Gate immedi
ately preced ins the lenten season, which
begins on March 3 next year, wan devel
oped at the meeting of the executive com
mittee yesterday afternoon.
Carnival Director Friealander is one of
the strongest advocates of the early date,
and favors a three days' display, ending
with a grand Mardi Gras celebration on
Shrove Tuesday night. This movement
has many snpporters and was made ma
special order for the next meeting.
The entertainment committee was in
structed to call at once upon the managers
of tbe various places of amusement which
have promised benefits for tho carnival
and arrange the dates. 80 far Morosco's,
the Orpheum and the Chutes have prom
ised to assist in this way.
Colonel O' Byrne was instructed to pre
pare an address to the public, notifying
them that the carnival was neither dead
nor sleeping, and that the work of prep
aration was being carried on witu Jmore
vigor than formerly.
General "Warfield announced his inten
tion of calling upon each member of the
executive committee who has been lax in
attendance and notifying him that he
would appoint some one else if the attend
ance were not more regular.
A committee, consisting of General
Warfleld, General Backus, 8. H. Fried
lander, I. L. Rosenthal, David Rich. Oscar
Boldemann and Colonel O'Byrne, was ap
pointed to call upon Rev. P. C. Yorke and
request him to deliver a lecture upon a
topic to be chosen by himself for the bene
fit of the carnival. It is proposed by the
committee in charge to make the affair a
demonstration for the reverend speaker,
who is recognized as one of the foremost
orators of the day. Tne subject will be
necessarily non-sectarian, and, as the car
nival is projected for the good of the entire
City, the committee hopes that he can be
prevailed upon to assist.
A selection of several of the designs for
posters submitted last week in competi
tion for the purse of $25 was maie, with a
view of selecting those most desirable for
reproduction. Bids will be asked from
printers, to get them out in lots of 50,000.
Anaward of the premium will be made at
the next meeting.
FRESNO BAPTIST CHURCH
Dr. I. S. Eshl enian Explain* His Finan-
cial Kelations With tbe Cuu
gregation.
Dr. I. S. Eshleman, who is a physician,
not a clergyman, has something to say
concerning the First Baptist Church of
Fresno, whioh was burned last Sunday
night.
"Some of the statements in the dis
patches published in Monday's Call,"
said the doctor, "do me an injustice.
"The additional cost of enlareing the
church was nearer $10,000 than $7500, as
stated in the telegram, but its value, I
should say, did not exceed $13,000. The
sum of $7600 was not donated, but loaned,
by me to the church. I had previously
given it $2000. The mortgage I neld as
security for the loan was executed by a
unanimous vote of the trustees, and there
were no questionable means whatever
used by me.
"William Harvey, the clerk of the
church, drew a defective mortgage, in
stead of submitting it to an attorney, as
directed, and three years later it was, con
sequently, repudiated. My interest in the
church was $10,000, injured for $5000. I
am accordingly loser $7000, including the
loan of $2000.

VARICOCELE.
the Most Weakening of All the Bad
Effects Following Excesses and
. Indiscretions. <\ r .
pEN CANNOT DEBCRIBE THE TOR-
*:- ture inflicted upon the victim of Vari-
cocele. This disease is a swollen condition
of the veins, which become weak and
flabby, get blue, ropy, causing impure cir-
culation, unhealthy perspiration and ex-
treme weakness. It drains and drags the
vital energy from .; the body. It destroys
strength; it ruins the nervous system, and
makes men unfit for society, business 01
pleasure.
Do you suffer from it? Watch yourself
carefully. It creeps 'upon its victim
quietly, like trie serpent, and if you do not
strangle it upon the appearance of the first
symptoms it may sap the foundation from
your structure. .' 1 ..
DR. BANDEN'S ELECTRIC BELT
cures Varicocele. It gives life into the
veins and . nerves, removes ' the stagnant
blood and sets up a . healthy circulation.

"The swollen veins are gone and mv
strength has all returned," says N.'Da-

tem. Drive it from your body by Dr. San-

"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington

NEW YORK, N. V.. Aug. 3.â The stock market
! to-day was a tame affair, the dealings footing up a
little over 95,000 shares of which three stocksâ
Sugar,. St. Paul and Manhattanâ figured for 61,400
shares. The movement throughout was entirely
professional. London furnished no business to
speak of, it having been a Bank of England holi
day, while, home operators' were inclined to go
slow until the political situation is better unaer
s ood. At the opening the market weakened
under sales of St. Paul. This selling was attributed
to the demoralization of rates in the West and had
an adv, influence on the geueral market.
After the early decline, which ranged from Vs to
1V 8 per rent in the usually active list and 214 per
cent, in Manhattan, the market improved slightly.
Manhattan fell to 85%, the lowest, in years, and
v.as the result of reiterated reports of decreased
earnings and rumors of a proposed reduction in
dividends, which cannot be confirmed. Sugar was
strengthened at the opening by the advance in
certain grades of refined, but later on the stock
fell from 104 to 1023/ and closed at 103%. , The
fluctuations in the railway list call for no special
mention, speculation closed quiet. Net changes
show losses of V4@y2 per cent. Manhattan and
Laclede Gas leading.

CHICAGO, li,iÂ», Aug. 3.â Wheat prices moved
In a narrow groove this morning, scarcely vibrat
ing a quarter of a cent in an hour. The absence
of outside trade was most marked and was widely
deplored among commission men. What little in
terest was felt in the statistical news centered in
the visible - supply, the final postings of which
showed a decrease of 408,000 bushels. This being
a holiday in England, traders were deprived of the
guide generally furnished by . Liverpool cables.
Receipts at Chicago were 266 cars, and 4698 bush
els were taken from store. The Northwest : re.
ceived 268 can, against 414 last Monday and ISO
a year ago.
The world's shipments, amount on passage and
other foreign statistics were not received. Subse
quent to the announcement of the visible supply
prices weakened, but rallied later on a report from
Missouri giving .he yield of that State as 12.000,
-000 bushels. Paris and Berlin closed higher and
Antwerp unchanged. Export clearances of wheat
and flour amounted to 212, bushels. The sale
of 400,i)00 bushels cash No. 3 red tor Eastern
shipment further strengthened prices in the last
hour, and the close was firm at almost the best
quotations of the day. September wheat opened
from 68Vic t0583/ a c. sold between 580 and 58% c,
closing at 58% c bid, 14c higher than Saturday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 225 cars.
CORNâ Did little better than drag along through
out the session. At the same time there was a fair
amount of steadiness consequent upon the fact
that arrivals, 1465 cars, were 135 less than ex
pected, and also in cons deration of liberal with
drawals from store 692,720 bushels. The visible
supply increased 1,942,000 bushels. September
corn opened from 243/gc to -4i,4c, advanced to 26c,
closing at 24%@25c, %<S>5/ 8 c higher than Satur
day. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 1600 cars.
OATSâ Were impressed by the feeling which
prevailed in the other markets. Quite a little
steadiness was noted early, but when wheat gave
indication) of weakening there was no hesitation
in the action of oats. Receipts were 433 cars and
2926 bushels were taken from store. Prices re
covered further along in the session through sym
pathy with the other markets. - The visible supply
Increased 6"-'iÂ»,000 bushels. September oats closed
a shade higher than Saturday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 550 cars. " . â¢ .'....
- FLaXâ steady. Cash, Northwestern, 75c; South
western, 72c;. September, 72V4@72%c; Decem

PROVISIONSâ Owing to the dullness ruling in
this market prices were relieved from violent
fluctuations, but none the less the tone early was
veryweait. For while immediately succeeding
the opening there was a pretense of steadiness, due
to a similar feeling in the hog market. This dlsap.
peared later, a sagging process following. .. When
wheat strengteened toward the close product sym
pathized, recovering the loss. September pork
closed '/Vie higher. September lard 6c higher and
Septemb r r.bs 2 @loc higher.

especially for fancy makes, to-day. These kinds

The receipts of cattle to-day were large, but the
proportion of choice was small. ; The general mar

much cheaper, however. Offerings of hogs were
not heavy. The feeling was stronger, an excep

were weak. Sheep were in moderate supply ana

Visitors in the Name of
the Directorate.
MANY NOVELTIES EXHIBITED
The Second Industrial County Exposi
tion Is Started Und?r Most
Favorable Circumstances.
Oakland Office Sas Fkaitcisoo Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 8. (
The second Industrial Exposition of
Alameda County was opened to the public
this morning, and was formally declared
open this evening.
Promptly at 10 o'clock this morning the
promised inharmony of steam whistles
rang out all over the length and breadth
of the city. Thomas Prather, the well
known banker, purchased the first ticket
â¢s the whistles were blowing, and there
was a good attendance during the day and
a big crowd at night.
Many novelties seemed to have sprung
into existence during the night, and
during the morning most of the exhibitors
were busy putting on the finishing touches.
To the visitors, the exposition is a reve
lation, and few people have any adequate
idea of the manufactories that are flourish
ing in this county. Alameda County was
bo long regarded as an adjunct to San
Francisco and as a beautiful place to pro
duce large carrots and fine grain that the
progress in the past ten years in the indus
trial line has not been even partially ex
ploited.
The exposition has removed this idea
and the tens of thousands of people who
will visit it during the next two weeks
and the many troops of school children
who have been invited will have far more
pride in their county when they have
reaped the full benefit of the complete ob
ject lesion of the tabernacle and grounds
President J. W. Nelson delivered an in
teresting speech at the opening exercises.
He said: "Nearly a year ago we made an
experiment and it was a success. Once
again the industrial progress in this city
has been set in motion by the opening of
the expo? ition. What you see here is the
result of intelligent co-operation on the
part of the ladies, the daily press, and
many other good people. All who nave
participated in or contributed toward
making this exposition what it is have
done so for the public good. As a citizen
of Oakland, 1 experience to-night a par
donable feeling of pride in presiding at
the opening of this splendid display of the
efforts of Oakland and Alameda County in
the industrial field.
"I have had, as you know, some ac
quaintance with the industries of our city
and county, but I confess that I am sur
prised at the number, the variety and the
excellence of the display made under this
roof, and which plainly demonstrates that
the majority of our own people know very
little ot what is going on in our midst or
of the extent and importance of our home
industries. And it is with this very ob
ject in view that the promoters of this ex
position have labored so industriously.
They wish to give the people of Alanieda
County information, as it were, as to what
our home manufacturers and producers
are doing; to let them know of the work
going on, and so bring it into review that
it may De known by everybody at home
as well as to attract the attention of people
abroad.
"No city in the State has greater ad
vantages for manufacturing than Oakland.
Let each of use our best endeavors to gain
more of these industrial enterprises for
Oakland, to tlie end that our growing
boys and girls may find employment and
that even a greater degree of prosperity
may bless our city. May this second in
dustrial exposition be productive of a
great deal of good to ourselves and to our
State, and may the time soon come when
we shall have one grand industrial exhibi
tion of manufactures and products of the
State of California under one roof ana
supported by State aid."
Mayor Davie was the next speaker. He
said:
. "As Mayor of Oakland I welcome you
here to-night. There can be none of you
/ more surprised than 1 to witness the pro
portions of this great fair. An awaken
ing of this sort is all that we need to give
Oakland a population greater than that of
Ban Francisco in thirty years. Patronize
your own industries and awaken your
civic pride. 1 hope also to live to see the
day when we shall have a permanent ex
hibition resembling what we have here to
night, but in a building which shall cover
an entire block and which shall be filled
with the products of our city and county."
' Senator Perkins also made a short
speech and impressed upon the audience
the necessity of patronizing home indus
tries. â¢
â  "Last year," he said, "California pro
duced $14,000,000 in gold, and our other
great interests, such as wheat and lumber,
are correspondingly, important. These
being the facts, it is unfortunate that
Eastern-made goods are dumped upon us
to the vast extent that they are. It is
possible that the convicts of San Quentin
are sleeping to-night under Eastern con
vict-made blankets. We Californians
ought to be opposed to convict labor and
convict-made goods of any sort."
â¢ Julius Bonn tag of San Francisco made a
stirring speech in favor of California prod
ucts and industries, and gave some figures
that astonished his listeners.
There was an enormous orowd in the
various buildings, and the exposition will
undoubtedly be a marked success in every
way.

AN OLIVE BRANCH.
It Is Offered by Chairman Mautalen,
but Mistrusted by Hilborn'*
Friends.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 3.â Charles Mau
talen of the Republican County Central
Committee sent a communication to the
committee of the "Friend" Congressional
committee to-<!ay stating that the Con
gressional committee does not understand
the desire of the County Committee in re
gard to the coming primary.
As a member of the County Committee
from the Sixth Ward, Mr. Mautalen says
he would like the Congressional commit
tee to send him a list of names of men
qaalified to act on the election boards and
he would give them half of the repre
sentation. The friends of Hilborn declare
to-nignt that tnis fiction on the part of
Mautalen is for the purpose of offsetting
the protest of the "Friend" committee,
which will be heard Dy the State Central
Committee to-morrow afternoon in San
Francisco. Conferences have been held
on both sides to-night and the feeling is
very bitter.
The last State Republican Convention
stated that hereafter all delegates must be
elected at primaries, and on this uround
they will seek to have the four dele?ates
at-large elected by the County Committee
and all of whom are favorable to Frick,
set aside and have them elected generally
at every polling-place in the county.

SAULPAUGH AT WORK.
Reinstated aa Engineer toy the South
ern Pacific Company After
Two YeÂ»rÂ«.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 3.â James A.
Saulpaugh, the old and well-known engi
neer who refused to take the train from
Sacramento during the strike in July,
1894, which was to break the two weeks'
successful blockade of traffic by the A. R.
U. men. has been reinstated by the South
ern Pacific Company. He has been given
an engine out of Sacramento.
The train was heavily guarded by
militia, and Saulpaugh said he would not
take his life In his hands by pulling it to
Oakland and quietly left the cab. His son
was firing the engine, and he too left. The
company called bam Clarke and he took
the train out. It was ditched just before
reaching Davis and two soldiers and
Clarke instantly killed.
The railroad discharged Saulpaugh at
the time, and he went to work on the
Laundry Farm road, where he has been
until a week ago. He is acknowledged to
be onn of the Dest engineers on the coast.
He ran for County Tax Collector at tne last
election, being defeated by James Barber,
the Republican incumbent.
THREATEN A FAMINE,
Dairymen Dissatisfi?d With the
Terms of the Milk Or
dinance.
A Doctor Gives an Opinion That is
Very Unfavorab'e to the
Proposed Test.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,!
908 Broadway. Aug. 3. f
The City Council raet to-night to con
sider the milk ordinance. Contrary to the
expectation of the lobby the measure was
referred to tne Ordinance and Judiciary
Committee. There were about a score of
dairymen present and outside the council
chamber City Veterinary Pierce had a
very lively time with them. They are
very much opposed to the ordinance in its
present shape and are of the opinion that
the test by tuberculine is not as reliable as
it should Lie.
The dairymen base their attitude partly
on the remarks of Dr. Seifridge, who ex
amined some of the microbes taken from
i)r. Wheeler's cow which was killed as a
test last w*ek. Dr. Seifridge aaid at that
time: "1 examined a specimen taken
from the retro-pharyngeal gland of Dr.
Wneeler't cow, and X found marked de
velopments of tuberculosis. I i:ardly
think, however, that the tuberculine test
is a sufficient warrant for the killing of
poor people's cows by public officers. I
am not convinced that the tuber
culine does not provide the cows
that are killed with the tubercu
losis that is afterward found in
their iungs or milk. To prove that this is
not so every cow suspected should have its
milk examined under the microscope be
fore the tnberculine is piven it and alSo
afterward. Under these circumstances if
no bacilli are found in the first instance
and some fonnd in the second the tuber
culine and not the cow is at fault. The
disease is one imperiling the lives of the
community, but the poor man must not
have his family support taken away with-
tuberculosis. Wtien
that is found, however, the cow should be
killed at once."
The report was circulated to-day that
the milkmen had entered into a combine
to defeat the final passage of the ordi
nance by creating a milk famine and
turning their product into cheese and
butter.
"This ordinance is altogether too arbi
trary," said a large dairy owner to-night,
"and the tuberculine test is not reliable
enough to risk the whole I.erd of a man
who hcs invested all his capital in his
business. If it bÂ» necessary we will go out
out of <ihe milK business and let the in
spector carry on his experiments as he
pleases. Pierce is a man of very limited
experience, and while no one wants to own
a diseased cow we do not want a cow to be
diseased by tuberculine and then killed,
which would have been all right if left
alone."
ALAMEDA SUFFRAGISTS.
An Interesting Meeting of tlie Political
Equality Club.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 3-The Politi
cal Equality Club met this evening in the
parlors of Mrs. E. A. Smith, 1725 Alameda
avenue, for the third of a series of educa
tional meetings that are being conducted
in the interests of the passage of the
eleventh amendment.
Rev. H. V. Morgan hold that the ballot
was woman's right, not as a question of
sentiment but of justice.
"Being more than a man, she is at least
entitled to all the political rights a man
enjoys," he said. "When I cast around
for a wife I looked for a woman that had a
mind of her own. The suffrage move
ment is opposed by scheming professional
politicians who live on voters of to-day as
cattle live on grass. If women are granted
the franchise they will never be bought,
and we shall have better laws for the safe
upbringing of our sons and daughters. I
consider the suffrage question the most
important one before the electors during
the corning campaign."
,C. Cubery was called upon for a speech
and made a few brief remarks, the purport
of which was that as men had got the po
litical affairs of the country into such a
complex tangle the women should be al
lowed to get in and help straighten the
tangle out.
M iss Morgan of San Francisco also spoke.

A little woman bearing the undisguised

Circumstances but for Her Daughter's Inkindness.
ing of indigents at the Supervisors' meet-
In k to-day. She carried in a little tin case
some documents, one of which is more
than a century old, and which clearly
establish her descent from one of the
noblest of the Scottish familifls of the last
century.
No creator of fiction dare promulgate a
story so tragic, so romantic or so pathetic
as that told by Mis. Margaret Booth, who
resides on Eighth street. For many years
this little, aged widow has been living on
the proceeds from the sale of her heir
looms. One by one hsr valued relics have
gone for bread and butter and among the
social set she is well known. Mrs. A. M.
McÃean and Mrs. Charles Webb Howard
have made purchases of relics and curios
from her, but now everything is gone but
an ancient punchbowl and some dear
memories. The bowl is too precious to
part with except under the Btressofdire
necessity, and the memories of the past
yield no physical support, so the un
happy woman, just 70 years of age, was
forced to resort to the last extremity and
seek aid of the county.
Very unique and sacred with age is the
clearance certificate issued, to her grand
father, John Ross, on April 3, 1796, by St.
Mungo's Lodge of Masonry, at Glasgow,
Scotland. The document is sealed over a
ribbon that was bine 100 years ago, but
which is now almost yellow. All the

ornamental work, and there is a great deal
of it, on the parchment was done by hand
and the coloring is well preserved. It
recommends John Ross to the good will
of Masons all around the globe and is
signed by G. R. B. Niven, R. W. M.
Mrs. Booth's father was Sir James Mont
gomery, who was a member of the Grand
Lodge of Ireland. He was given a certifi
cate by that lodge on April 6, 1812. Unlike
that of his father, his parchment is a steel
engraving and is printed in English and
Latin.
The ancient bowl wns the property of
Baron Ro?s and came into the possession
of the family in Scotland in 1772 and has
been the wedding present to successive
brides ever since. The bowl is ornamented
with M sonic characters.
But for the interference of a daughter,
now dead, the circumstances of Mrs.
Booth might have been much more pleas
ant. Many years ago she was about to
wed a second husband. He departed on a
long trip on the return of which he was to
have been married. Her doughter did not
approve of the mntcli and according to
her mother's story she intercepted the
letters that came from him and kept them
from her. Not for years afterward did
Mrs. Booth discover how she had been
treated. She still looks forward to a re
union with her lost lover, but has no idea
of where lie has bean for many years.
Some tragic fate seems to have set its
mark on each of the unhappy woman's
four sotis. Her baby 18 months old was
poisoned by a prescription put up by a
doctor who was drunk. Her second boy
when a little fellow 10 years of age went
out on a small lake near their iionie in
Sierra County and was drowned. Another
son, when a youns: man, was stabbed to
death by an Italian, and the last while
employed as a clerk at the Oakland City
Hail died after a day's illness of pneu
monia.
While troubles were falling thick upon
her Mrs. Booth was frozen so badly that
one of her limbs had to be amputated.
The Woman's Exchange has been of
great help to her and several prominent
Masons have undertaken the task of see
ing if some of the property now in
chancery cannot be obtained! for her.
Ross Castle, Montgomery Castle and an
estate in Dundee are the property of the
Montgomery family, and it is believed
that when the facts are known the un
happy woman who now barely ekes out
an existence in two rooms will have no
need to beg an order for groceries from
the county^ ____Â«Â«_Â«Â«.
TWO FOUND GUILTY.
In wall and Gordon Convicted and An

Bondsmen.
OAKLAND, Cm-., Aug. 3.â Harry Inwall,
who was cited to show cause why he
should not be punished for contempt of
court by Judge Greene in approaching M.
Lipka when on the term panel of jurors
that would have the gold-brick operators
to try, was found guilty and fined $100
and ordered to be imprisoned in the
County Jail for rive days.

is again confined within the County Jail.
His second trial is set for the latter part

Two Test Cases.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 3.â The District
Attorney is preparinc two test cases that
will be of considerable interest to the tax
payers of the county and officials of other
counties in the State. One is that of the
People vs. Henry Evers, ex-Coroner, for
the purpose of recovering to the county
about $1400 alleged to have been errone
ously collected as fees. The other is a suit
to collect $191 from Assessor Dalton's
bondsmen, the amount of the personal
taxes of the Pacific Postal Telegraph-Cable
Company for the year 1895 which were al
lowed to become delinquent.
Not an Incompetent.
OAKLAND. Cal., Aug. 3.â Judge Greene
to-day refused to appoint a guardian for
Mrs. Nellie E. Butler because she was not
an incompetent, although it was shown
that through age and overindulgence in
drink she was unable to even move about
without assistance. She is without home
or friends, and has only a $12 monthly
pension to sustain herself. This she has
repeatedly used in securing drink at the
expense of her bills. No one seems to
know what will become of her now.
Committed to Napa.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 3. â Mrs. Mc-
Laren of 686 East Twenty-fourth street
was declared insane by Judge Greene to
day and committed \n Napa. The wit
nesses were her husband and (laughter.
They seemed to know very little about the
case. A week ago Mrs. McLaren shot her
self in a room and cut a great gash in her
throat. She has worried over the in
ability of her husband to secure work un
til her mind has given away.
Wasted Sympathy.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 3.-Dr. E. C.
Love, a regularly graduated physician
well known in this city, is being greatly
annoyed by the prominence being given
one E. Jri. Love regarding domestic
troubles. He h as received numerous let
ters of sympathy from old friends, and is
undetermined whether they are joking or
in earnest. He is a single man and does
not at all enjoy the affair.
New Trial Granted.
OAKLAND, Oal., Aug. 3.â Judge Greene
has ruled that he erred in admitting cer
tain statements of Dr. Kobinson as evi
dence in the snit of Robert P. Jansen
against the Southern Pacific Company
wherein the plaintiff was awarded $10,000
damages by a jury. As a consequence' he
has granted the company a new trial.
Short of Cash.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 3.â G. H. Kel
logg, the railroad watchman and former
detective of the Southern Pacific Com
pany, has filed a petition to be declared an
insolvent. He owes $508, most of which is
for board and medical attendance. There
are no assets except wearing apparel in
use valued at $20.
He Was Jealous.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 3.â Details have
been received of the attempted suicide of
Sidney Priedy, a former Oaklander, in
New YorK City July 25. He always ap
peared to be too much a man of tha world
to be jealous, but such was apparently the
real cause of his act.
Will Not BÂ»ducÂ«.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 3.â The City
Council sat as a Board of Equalization to
night to hear the Contra Costa Water
Company's application for a reduced as
sessment. After a heated argument the
board decided not to reduce the Assessor's
figures and to tax the franchise at $100,000.

Superintendent Black called the meet
ing to older and said:
Fellow Teachers: In calling you to order
allow me to express my gratification at meet
ing so many of the school superintendents of
the State en this important occasion. As you
are aware I made arrangements with the Code
Commissioners to get your views on needed
school legislation and present the same to
them for consideration. With this end in
view I took (he liberty in January last of ap
pointing a committed of sixteen county and
city superintendent!, with Deputy Seaman a."
chairman. lam happy to say that this com
mittee has done some faithfui and intelligent
work, which will be presented to you to-day
for your consideration.
In recommending amendments to the school
law I cannot refrain from urging upon you the
necessity of a conservative spirit. The law has
suffered" much from frequent and trivial
amendments. When the law is well settled it
ought not to be disturbed except for good and
sufficient reasons. In my judgment the most
pressing necessity is the simplification of the
certification of teachers. As it is there are
some thirteen or fourteen different papers on
which teachers are allowed to teach" at the
present time.
He urged uniform requirements for all
grades of certificates; requested that it be
determined what grades of certificates
should be issued, and asked that some
action be taken regarding the recognition
of kindergartens. Referring to educational
diplomas he saia :
1 recommend for your serious consideration
the abolition of this document in the interest
of the teachers of the State. Owing to differ
ences in figuring out the time for fife
diplomas, I recommend that a certain number
of months be required, rather than years.
I ask your judgment on the advisability of
maintaining an official organ for the depart
ment of education.
Ttie hich-scbool law ought to receive your
careful attention, as it is still crude and Its
sections unharmoniouÃ.
The compulsory educational law needs
amending; the second section providing for
its publication should be stricken out.
There are mÃny minor details, such as chang
ing the phraseology and a few dates, etc., that
will occur to you in your official capacities,
and about which I need not worry you.
I have called your attention to the points that
seem tome to be of more than passing im
portance. They either embrace or overshadow
all other questions.
State Superintendent S. T. Black was
elected president, with Miss Kate Ames of
Napa City for his assistant. Deputy State
Superintendent W. W. Seaman of Los An
geles was chosen secretary, with J. P.
Greeley of Santa Ana as assistant.
Superintendent McClymonds of Oakland
presented an invitation from the board of
directors of the exposition, asking the
members of the convention to visit the ex
position. After they accented the invita
tion and set 3 o'clock to-morrow as the
hour of their visit, he distributed tickets to
each one for admission to-night at the
opening exercises.
The report of the committee of sixteen
was presented. The assistant secretary
read the first proposed amendment. It
related to section 1543, third subdivision.
At present the county superintendents
must draw a requisition on the Auditor,
who draws a warrant on the Treasurer.
The committee thought that the trustees'
order needed only to be stamped "ap
proved" and then the Auditor could
draw a warrant. The convention re
jected the amendment.
On reassembling in the afternoon
Charles A. Allen, formerly president of
the State Normal School at San Jose, was
elected an honorary member of the con
vention. He spoke a few words of greet
ing to the visitor? after which the bal
ance of the report of the committee of six
teen was read, the secretary explaining
the cause of suggested charges as he read.
Section 1770 was taken up. It provides
for a semi-annual examination of teach
ers and was amended to read annually.
Many of the Superintendents wanted to
do away with examinations entirely and
take their supply of teachers from the
universities and normal schools. Others
wanted an examination every six months,
and the annual examination was accepted
as a compromise.
In subdivision seventh, section 1543, the
woriis "to persons holding certificates of
like grade granted in other counties,
cities or cities and counties" was stricken
out. In place of the words '-certificate or
diploma was inserted the word "cre
dentials"; "and 1503" was inserted after
the figures 1775. These changes remove
the compelling of the Superintendents to
isaue temporary certificates to teachers
holding certificates in other thÃn their
own counties.
Section 1577, pertaining to the formation
of new school districts, was amended to
permit of their organization only between

IGNORE AMERICA.
Rev. Barton Perry Could Not " team
the Names or Presidential Nomi
nees in England. ... .
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 3.â Rev. Barton
W. Perry returned from his European
trip to-day. The main object jof his trip
through Scotland : and ; England was to
make personal observations of the econ
omic conditions-of those countries.
"I could not help but be surprised,"
said Mr. Perry to-night, 4l that so little
general interest was expressed in our
National conventions, which were held
while I was in the manufacturing center
of England. It may seem strange to say,
but I could not for several day 3 learn who
was the Vice-Presidential candidate of the
Republican party. The leading news
papers contained about ten lines a day of
telegraphic news from this country and
sometimes none at all.
"It is a great mistake to suppose that
the ordinary Englishmaniakes a personal
interest in American politics. He does
not, and outside of London capitalists and
a few politicians this country is practically
unthought of. This was a great surprise to
me, as I thought the reverse was the case.
Occasionally there is an editorial on
American politics, but it is rare.
"I traveled on a wheel through Scotland
and England and only spent $1 for travel
ing expenses in 1000 miles. The roads
there are perfect. One little incident
mows how tenaciously some of the lead
ing hotels cling to old English customs.
At the great St. Enoch's Hotel at Glasgow,
perhaps the finest in Scotland, I was
handed a tallow candle when I went to
my apartment."

Hurt at the Baths.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 3.â John W.
Edwards, the 15-year-old son of William
Edwards of Franklin and Fifth streets,
Oakland, met with a serious accident yes
terday at the Terrace Baths. Edwards
came over with a party of friends who all
went In Bwimming. After a short while
they indulged in horse play on the plat
form and steps. In the scuffling Edwards
was tumbled over the railing into the
water. He landed in two feet of water on
his head, the shock producing a concus
sion of the spinal column and partial
paralysis. He was at once taken out of
the water by Loui3 Schroeder and Dr.
Morgan's assistance obtained. He is still
at the baths, able to speak and eat a little,
but his recovery is by no means certain.

Brfcf N ws Items.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 3.â The fall
term of the Berkeley public schools opened
to-day.
The enrollment of the East Berkeley
schools, including the High School, was as
follows: Rose-street 93, Whittier 306, Kel
logg 223, Le Conte 367, Lorin 253. Total,
1185,
The enrollment at the Kellogg School
was comparatively small, owing to the
transfer of the eighth grade to the Whit
tier School, and also to the fact that notice
had been given of the postponement of the
opening of the eighth and ninth grades
in the High School until August 10. Over
200 high school pupils reported this morn
ing and were dismissed.
In the West Berkeley schools the enroll
ment was larger than ordinary. At the
San Pablo school 219 children reported, at
the Seventh-street seventy-seven and at
the Columbus 172, making a total of 468
for the West End. The San Pablo School
house has been put into excellent condi
tion. The walls have been newly tinted,
the desks Tarnished and general repairs
have been made throughout the building.

DEMOCRATS STAND
FOR SOUND MONEY,
Independent Forces Are
Getting Together in
California.
E. B. POND IS HONORED.
Irish Says a Big Delegation
Will Go to the National
Convention. ,
MUCH STATE CORRESPONDENCE
What Some Populist Leaders Have
Said in Confidence About Bryan's
Nomination at St. Louis.
The California portion of the Demo
cratic sound-money movement to organ
ize a regular old-line Democratic party
and put a complete ticket in the field is
rapidly taking definite shape, and it is
now a certainty that in this State the
sound-money Democrats will hold a State
convention and nominate electoral and
Congressional tickets.
E. B. Pond has been named as the Cali
fornia representative on the provisional
executive committee which is to meet in
Indianapolis next Friday to issue a call
for a National convention. Mr. Pond's
name was placed on the roll on the sug
gestion of John P. Irish and some other
Democratic leaders here, and he has ac
cepted the honor, although he will be un
able to attend the meeting. This State
will not be directly represented at this
first National conference at Indianapolis,
but Mr. Fond will send his proxy to some
Eastern Democrat who will attend,
probably to Congressman Bynum of In
diana.
John P. Irish has so far been the most
active spirit in tne new party movement in
this State. He returned yesterday from a i
trip to Placer County ana found quite a |
mass of correspondence relating to it |
awaiting him.
"As soon as the National call ia issued,
said Mr. Irish yesterday, "a State conven- j
tion will be held, in this State to nominate !
a full electoral and Congressional ticket in j
every district.
"Mr. Pond has acquiesced in his appoint- I
ment as the representative of this State at j
the Indianapolis meeting, but he will prob- j
ably forward his proxy. When the
National convention is held a full delega
tion will attend, and the prospect is that a
large company of old- line Democrats will
go with the delegation. We are already
making arrangements to secure the same
convention races that were accorded to the
other National conventions.
"From my correspondence it is already j
evident that a majority, if not all, of the \
counties of the State will be represented j
in the State convention. I and other |
Democrats who are interested in preserv
ing the honor of the party have received
many letters of interested inquiry and as
surances of co-operation from Los Angeles,
Santa Barbara, Sacramento, Monterey,
Fresno, Sai, Diego, Yuba, Placer and Sut
ter counties. Tuey are from Demorcrats,
all urging organization and puttine a
ticket in the field."
Mr. Irish is an observant man who has
had large experience with political affairs,
and his estimate of the situation and the
party prospects in this State will be of in
terest and value.
"I mink," he said yesterday, '-that the j
sound money Democratic ticket will poll
25,000 votes in California.
â¢'Of course, a large element of the sound l
money Democrats of this State will follow !
the course advocated by Bourke Cockran j
and vote directly for McKinley. I find
that this is especially true of the working
men â the wage-earners â who have hereto
fore vott -d the Democratic ticket and who
make nothing out of politics except the I
dividends they get from the good effect cf
political policies upon their labor and
wages. Tney have such a near-by
example of the effect of the silver
standard upon the wages of labor
in Mexico that their revolt against
such conditions and against such a beg
garly scale of wages carries them clear
over to the Republican ticket."
Mr Irish will probably take a very
active and prominent part in the com
ing campaign. He will attend the Na
tional convention soon to be called,
and he already has several stumping tours
in the East and West in view. One of
them may be in Colorado, from where the
State Civic Association has sent him an
invitation to make a tour of the largest
cities, speaking in the interest of sound
money.
Since the California Populists have re
turned from St. Louis they have not
spoken all that is in their minds and
hearts, though a great majority of them
have only half concealed their disappoint
ment at the strange result of that conven
tion.
They are all expecting, or at least the
leaders have been expecting, Sewall|to re
sign. Mr. Irish stated yesterday a reason
for this expectation which the Populists
have not yet given out.
'â¢Two of the Populist leaders who were
of the inner councils at the St. Louis con
vention." said Mr. Irish, "tell me that
Bryan or Jones has betrayed the Populists.
They say it was arranged for Bryan to
make his bold stand for Sewall, after
which the St. Louis convention was to
nominate Watson and follow with the
nomination of Bryan. Then Mr. Sewall
was to play Pythias to Bryan's Damon
and decline the Democratic nomination.
But Sewall now refuses. The Populists
have done their part and adjourned, and
as Bryan's yoke-fellow has balked he must
decline the Populist nomination or lose
the benefit of his celebrated telegram to
Chairman Jones."
John Daggett is one of the administra
tion Democrats who stand by the Chicago
convention.
"I went into the State convention to
make a fight for sound money," he said
yesterday, "and we were beaUn. I accept
the result and will support the ticket."
J. J. Valentine is one of the gold Demo
crats very earnestly interested in the sound
money movement.
NEW PARK CHURCH.
Congregational! rts to Build a
Modern Edifice Near the
Park Panhandle.
The executive committee of the Church
Extension Society of the Congregational
churches in San Francisco met in the
rooms of the American Tract Society yes
terday to discuss the proposition of pur
chasing a lot near the panhandle of the
park, upon which the Park Congregational
Church proposes to erect a modern and
commodious edifice.
It was decided that the Church Exten
sion Society purchase such a piece of
ground on some prominent corner near
the panhandle.
The Park Congregational Church mem
bers now worship in the Y. M. C. A.
branch building, on the corner of Baker
and Fell streets. The church has been in
existence for two years, and at one time it
was thought necessary to disband on ac
count of the deplorable condition of the
church's finances.
At the beginning of this year Rev.
James B. Orr was chosen as pastor. He
brought to his work all the enthusiasm of
youth, couplfid with various educational
advantages, and the result is that the con
gregation has so increased that it is
thought advisable at this time to erect a
place of worship.
LEFT HER WITH A KISS.
MrÂ». William Bracken Tells a Sad Story
of Her Husband's Faithlessness
and Desertion.
"My husband kissed me and then left
me, taking another woman with him."
This is Mrs. William Bracken's sad rela
tion to one of the officers of ihe_ Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
She says Bracken married her two years
ago with the object of gaining possession
of $1800 which she had by inheritance
from her deceased mother. The wedding
took place in Illinois, but the couple soon
after commenced drifting about, going to
Manitou, Colo., Vancouver Island and
numerous other places, winding up event
ually in Salem. Or.
Two weeks ago, according to Mrs.
.Bracken's story, her husband Kissed her
and went out, saying he would return
sbortly. Since then she has not seen
him, but claims to have reason for be
lieving that he fled with an actress, whose
name she declines to divulge. As she is
nearly destitute she intends working in a

RAYS FROM IRE GRIND JURY SEARCHLIGHT
The Story Told by P. B.
Cornwall to the Wal
lace Jury.
IT IS NOW OF GREAT
SIGNIFICANCE.
Two Years' Contract for Public
Lighting Awarded by the
Supervisors.
A VERY HIGH RATE PAID BY
THE CITY.
The Investigation Just Now Pending
Will Be Certain to Develop
Some Rather Peculiar
Transactions.
The Grand Jury did not meet yesterday,
and, so far as can be ascertained, no ses
sion will be held until next Friday. But
members of the jury are not idie, and
others than P. B. Cornwall may be heard
as witnesses at the next meeting.
At last accounts Mr. Cornwall was in
Seattle. No information has reached the
Grand Jury to raise a doubt about his
attendance. In view of the remarkable
disclosures which Mr. Cornwall made
under oath to one Wallace Grand Jury in
1892, more than ordinary interest is in
volved in the call for his presence at this
time.
P. B. Cornwall was then president of the
Electric Light Company. The Grand Jury
subpenaed the president, the vice-presi
dent and the manager, George Roe.
One officer testified that he did not know
of any money having been paid to Chris
topher Buckley or any other person to in
fluence the Board of Supervisors.
Ten minutes later Mr. Cornwall, the
president, was called. He testified that at
first the company paid Buckley $250 a
month. The compensation was finally in
creased until it reached $450. One single
payment of $8000 was made. The custom
was to draw a check for the monthly al
lowance to Buckley, and for Mr. Roe to
leave it at Sutro & Co., brokers. Mr. Corn
wall's testimony was to the effect that
$25,000 a year had been paid to regulate
the Supervisors. He was so disgusted
with the transactions that he sold out his
stock in the corporation. He told the
jury that these facts were known to all
the directors of the company.
The Grand Jury then resolved to bring
in the manager, George Roe, and compel
him to produce the books of the corpora
tion. Several subpenas were issued for
him, but not one was served. For some
reason Mr. Roe, who was known to be in
or about the City, could not be found at
his office.
After some days' delay and disgust an
anonymous letter was received by a well
known member of the jury who is now a
citizen of San Francisco, stating where
Mr. Roe could be found at a certain hour
of the day. This member of the jury had
a subpena placed in the hands of Detective
Robert Hogan. who is now connected with
the District Attorney's office. Mr. Roe
was found at the place designated in the
anonymous letter and served in due form
with the subpena by Detective Hogan.
Manager Roe then asked for an inter
view with the member of the Grand Jury
who had charge of that line of the investi
gation. The interview was accorded and
took place in secret at the residence of the
member. In that secret conference Mr.
Roe said he believed that the Supreme
Court would decide that the Grand Jury
was an illegal body. He said if he should
respond, tell all he knew and produce the
books and thereafter the jury should t*
adjudged an illegal body that all tbe'rob
bers and scalawags would be on his back.
He asked for time, pledging his word that
if the jury was sustained by the Supreme
Court he would tell the whole story with
out reservation and produce the books to
verify it.
The member of the Grand Jury who
then conducted that negotiation said yes
terday to a Call reporter that he assented
to the arrangement suggested by Mr. Roe
and waited for the Supreme Court to de
cide. The decision of the Supreme Court,
as Mr. Roe anticipated, was against tHe
legality of the Wallace Grand Jury and
Mr. Roe never testified as a witness. He
died subsequently, and so the inside de
tails as to particular methods of disburse
ment were never submitted.
Mr. Cornwall may return to this City
by the end of the present week. He will
be heard as a witness by the Grand Jury
soon after he shall have arrived. As the
president, successively, of three electric
lighting companies he ought to be able to
tell something of the subject of street
lighting in the City of San Francisco in all
its aspects.
He was first a president of the California
Electric Light Company, next president of
the Edison Electric Light and Power Com
pany, and is now the head of the Mutual
Electric Light Company. His incumbency
in these three positions, collectively, has
covered a series of years and the terms of
office of successive Boards of Supervisors.
During all that period rumors derogatory
to the Supervisors have been periodically
believed. If there has been any attempt,
successful or unsuccessful, by the Super
visors to raid the treasury of any electric
light company in San Francisco he has
irarvr to-dat.

certainly had good opportunities to know j
ah the facts. Hence his coming is awaited
with interest by private individuals as it is
by the community at large.
Some facts have come to the surface in
reference to the discrimination against
the City as compared with the prices paid
by private parties for lights. The pro
posals for bids for electric street-lighting
included 622 masts, each mast being forty
feet high, each light to be 2000 candle
power, the lights to be kept burning from
one hour after sunset until half an hour
before sunrise, with the exception of three
nights when the moon is about full each
month, lights being suspended the night
of the full moon, the night following and
the night preceding. There was also the
exception that nine lamps in Chinatown,
one lamp at the City Receiving Hospital
and one lamp at the Folsom-street police
6tation shall be lighted every night.
Bidders were called upon to estimate
the price of each lamp of 2000 candle
power per night. In the proposals for the
gas-lighting contract the number of lamp
posts to be maintained wai 5100, with the
option that the number might be in
creased, upon due authorization, not to
exceed 5800 during the continuance of the
contract. The burners of the various
lamps must average a consumption of not
less than five cubic feet per hour.
Under existing conditions the only com
petition which could be immediately of
fered in street lighting must come from a
rival electric light company, namely, the
Mutual Electric Light Company. But as
the contracts awarded read for two years
the rates that the Board of Supervisors
have allowed to the lighting companies
will stand for a long period. It is this
period of two years in the contractfjwhich
has excited so much indignation.
There are two reasons for indignation.
The first is that machinery for the produc
tion of electric lights especially is being
continually improved, the result being
that electric light can be provided at less
cost one year hence than it can be at this
time; and if there shall be any cheapening,
which is inevitable, the public should have
all the advantage which can be derived in
that way. Moreover, it is absolutely cer
tain that nothing can occur to make the
production of electric light any more ex
pensive at the end of twelve months than
it is at this time. Consequently there is
no reason in sight why the publis interest
can be said to have been conserved by a
contract for two years.
The second reason for indignation is that
the rates which the Board of Supervisors
have authorized in behalf of the City are
much in excess of the rates charged to
private parties for the same service.
Some explanation may be needed on
this point, but the facts are indisputable.
The average time per night during which
electric lights will burn for the illumina
tion of the City is ten and a half hours,
taking in the long nights with the short
ones. The specifications are from one hour
after sunset till a half hour before sunrise.
Private parties have an all-night service,
averaging twelve hours, taking long nights
and shorts together. This means that on
the City contract the contracting company
gains one and a half hours every night,
as compared with the service they are
compelled to furnish to private parties,
which is one full night saved by the com
pany every week on the City contract. At
the rate of 55 cents per electric light per
night the City pays $3 85 per week for ten
and a half hours' burning per night. Pri
vate parties get the electric service twelve
hours per night for $3 per week.
There is another way to figure this. If
the City had the same period of nightly
service that the private parties secure, the
price paid per lamp per week by the City
would be $4 36 at the present rates. The
City has on an average seventy-three and
a half hours light per week and the private
parties have eighty-four hours for less
money.
The matter of incandescent lights is
smaller than the arc light matter, but the
same rate of discriminations in the price
paid by the City, compared with the same
price paid by private citizens, appears.
The rates are estimated by the 1000 watts.
The rate charged to the City is 11 cents.
Large concerns, like the Palace Hotel, pay
only between 5 and 6 cents per 1000 watts,
or about half the price charged up against
the City. The incandescent lights fur
nished to the City illuminate the new City
Hall, an engine-house on Bush street and
a truckhouse on O'Farrell street.
The City is a much larger customer than
private concerns, which get a much lower
rate. What becomes of the excess in
price paid by the City is undoubtedly an
interesting question. There are those
who assert that in this lies the explana
tion of the supply of coin which is used to
"square" Supervisors and to keep up all
prices Dy shutting out competition as
much as possible in the light-furnishing
business.
An odd feature is found in the fact that
in outlying districts gas lamps are found
burning almost under electric arc lights,
where the gas lights do no practical good,
but they are paid for by the City at a speci
fied rate.
THE BONDS ARE VALID,
Judge McKenna Overrules the
Demurrer of the City of
Santa Cruz.
It Is Generally Thought That This
Piactically Settles the Disputed
Point
Judge McKenna yesterday overruled
the demurrer of the city of Santa Cruz in
the suit brought by Robert K. Waite to
recover the interest on certain- bonds.
While the defendants are given twenty
days in which to amend their answer, the
decision of the Circuit Court Judge is re
garded as practically settling the case.
The action in question was brought by
Waite to recover the interest on bonds
issued by the city of Santa Cruz tinder the
act of March, 1893, which authorizes any
municipality other than those of the first
ciass to refund their indebtedness. In
1894 Banta Cruz owed $360,000, and when
the proposition to refund this was sub
mitted to the people it was carried by a
vote of nearly three to one.
Bonds bearing 5 per cent interest were
accordingly issued for the amount named
above. Tbey were divided into forty
classes of nine bonds each. In May of
last year the interest on the first batch be
came due. ThÂ« City Treasurer of Santa
Cruz refused to pay the same, whereupon
Waite instituted suit in the United States
Circuit Court to recover the interest on
the entire issue of $360,000, amounting to
$21,300.
The defendants entered a demurrer ask
ing that the action be dismissed on the
following grounds:
First, the bonds were only payable out of
certain funds.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 4, 1896.
Second, the Issue was unconstitutional be
cause the act of 1893 was special or class legis
lation.
Third, illegal because the amount of $360,
-000 exceeded the bonded indebtedness which
the city of Sunta Cruz could legally contract.
Fourth, the refunding act did not authorize
the issuing of bonds.
Fifth, the bonds were not issued by the city
of Santa Cruz because they were ouly signed
by the Mayor and City Clerk.
Judge McKenna after reviewing tne case
at considerable length said :
The questions Involved in all these proposi
tions are close ones, but I do not think the
first, second, fourth and fifth can be sustained.
â¢ â¢ * Agp.inst the third proposition, to wit,
that there was an excessive and illegal issue of
bonds, the complaint urges the recital of the
bonds. On the controversy hence arising a
great many cases have been cited, whic* I
have eareiully studied. I have come to no
confident conclusion. Indeed, the contention
of the defendant is not with certainty pre
sented in the bill. Assuming that there was a
limitation of the power of the city, depending
upon the existence of certain conditions of
fact, the knowledge of the takers of the bonds
of the existence of such conditions is not
clearly apparent from the bill, and I am there
fore reluctant to base a decision on a question
of law, unless there can be no ambiguity about
the facts.
The court them read numerous decisions
in which the same point was involved, with
the difference that the purchasers fully
understood the conditions of the purchase.
In conclusion Judge McKenna said:
It is claimed by the defendant that a fair in
ference from these averments is that plaintiff
knew of the excess of the issue, and hence is
not a bona-fide purchaser. But it certainly
does not follow, and as there is an ambiguity,
Ido not care to base an opinion upon it, but
will reserve it until the answer is filed. The
demurrer of the defendant is therefore over
ruled.
CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS.
Important Communication Sent by Will
K. Fisher to the Progressive
Associations.
Will E. Fisher, the well-known real
estate agent, sent an important communi
cation yesterday to the Chamber of Com
merce, the City Board of Trade, the Manu
facturers and Producers' Association, the
Merchants' Association and the State
Board of Trade.
It was a lengthy document and pointed
out the necessity of something being done
to promote the sain of California products
an<> to induce immigration to this State.
He proposed that the live bodies should
combine to form an association with
these two important objects in view,
and to carry them into effect he suggested
that exhibits of the products of the State
should be maintained at the expense of
the State in the principal centers of popu
lation in the East. The exhibits could
be of the same character as those to be
seen in the Board of Trade rooms here.
The exhibits could be placed in the
railroad depots in the large Eastern
cities and a man placed in charge to take
orders for the products, thereby bringing
trade to the producers and at the same
time promoting immigration.
A JANITOR IS MISSING,
W. F. Brooks of the Emporium
Has Not Shown Up for
Two Days.
la Debt to His Assistantsâ The Police
Are Looking for the
Fugitive.
Tha management of the Emporium
and also seventeen janitors employed in
the mammoth building are on a still but
determined hunt for W. F. Brooks, who
up to yesterday occupied the position of
head janitor of the mammoth Market
street structure.
Brooks is not only gone but he has
taken with him the month's wages of the
aforesaid seventeen janitors earned by the
sweat of their brow during the warm days
of July.
When the Emporium building was fin
ished there was great rivalry as to who
would get the plum of head janitor, and
there were many aspirants for the place.
Ordinarily a janitor's job is not
a sinecure, but in the care of
a vast building like the Empo
rium the man who directs the clean
ers of all the offices is a man of some im
portance, and has as much patronage to
dispense as many a petty politician.
Brooks won the prize, and for some time
things ran smoothly among tne Em
porium janitors.
Brooks collected the wages for the men
and when the joyful period of the month
known as payday arrived he dispensed to
each according to his earnings.
Brooks turned the money over to his
subordinates regularly every month until
the payday for July, which was yesterday,
came around. â¢
Then }c failed to materialize with the
coin. His men came as usual for their
stipend, but Brooks was missing, and a
search of his usual haunts failed to locate
him. j
Then the management of the place and
the janitors became anxious ana started
out determined to look for him. At his
residence nothing was known of his
whereabouts and the police were finally
notified.
August Feist, president of the Em
porium Company, when asked last night
about the story said: 4; The hend janitor
has not shown up for two days and his as
sistants, to whom he owes money, are
fearful that he has skipped.
"The Emporium Company had a contract
with Brooks, and is not, of course, re
sponsible for any of his misdeeds. The
amount he owes cannot exceed a few hun
dred dollars. This is all the information I
can give you about the matter."
CONVICT-CUT STONE.
The Stonecutters' Union Is Indignant
at the M itlvii liter Fair Commi-tsi oners
The stonecutters are up in opposition to
the Midwinter Monument which has been
just finished and put in place on. ground
where the fair had been held. This op
position is not because of the monument
itself, but because the stone was cut by
convicts at the Folsom State Prison.
The Stonecutters' Union claims that the
base and cap upon which tbe statue stands
were shipped to this City at the same time
that the stone for the Grant monument
came, but the opposition of the taades
unions to the placing of the Grant stone
in tne park had a chilling effect upon the
Midwinter Fair Commissioners, and as a
result the stone was boxed up until the
storm blew over, when it was resurrected
and put in place.
The vigilance of the stonecutters did
not abate, however, and they watched the
movements until the discovery was made
that the convict-dressed stone was put in
place. Hence their mdi -nation at the
acts of tne Midwinter Fair Commissioners.

"STAY AND STARVE"
Henry Grim Arraigns the
City and County
Hospital.
ESCAPED FOR BEAR LIFE
"I Was Locked Up in a Room
and No One Paid Any At
tention to Me."
PATHETIC TALE OF A PARIAH.
Dumped On the City by M-ndocino
County and Always Told, Like
Jce, to "Move On."
Like Dickens' poor Joe in "Bleak
House" Henry Grim, the possible leper
alleged insane and thought-to-be-only
feeble-minded 10-year-old boy, now held,
housed and detained at the Receiving
Hospital, is told to "move on, and on."
He was first told to move on by Mendo
cino County â to move on to San Francisco
and become a burden to this now over
burdened City. It was an admirable thing
for Deputy Sheriff Day of Mendocino to
dump Henry Grim, his father and sister,
Lena, out of a hack at the Central police
station here. That was three weens ago,
The Grims have been living in the woods
on the north fork of Little River, the
father ana son cutting tanbark and wood
and the 14-year-old daughter keeping
house in their forest shanty.
The two male Grims are hunters, and
large and small game found in the bush
eked out their commissary department.
Finally word was passed the country
around that the family were lepers. They
had formerly lived in the Hawaiian
Islands, and this, coupled with the fact
that the girl appeared to be afflicted with
the dreaaful plague, was enough to make
them unfit for even the wild woods. The
authorities had them examined by the
county physician, and the best way to dis
pose of the lepers was to ship them to San
Francisco. The story of their enforced
journey thither may be best told by the
lad Henry :
"We were brought down to Ukiah,"
said he yesterday at the Receiving Hos
pital, "by Deputy Sheriff Day and taken
aboard the train for this City. At the
ferry landing here we were all bundled
into a back, stagecoach or whatever you
call it, by Day, and the driver was told to
take us to this place. Father is lame, hay
iiig cut his foot some time ago, and his
iujury was not doctored right. He was
not locked up and I believe he has Rone
back home. I forgot to tell you that the
officers of Mendocino County burned our
cabin and everything in it after we were
taken away.
"Next day my sister was sent to the
Pesthouse and I was taken to the City and
County Hospital. There I was locked up
in a room and nearly starved. Nobody
paid any attention to me, and if I had not
climbed the fence and run away I would
have died. Everybody is hungry there,
and that is the reason they stay sick; they
just stay in their wards and starve and
starve.
"If I was out in the Mendocino woods at
home witii my rifle I could k'll enough of
game to keep'myself and half of that hos
pital in meat. Father and I have often
taken our dogs and killed brown bear,
deer and other garae on Little River and
back in Humboldt County. I have often
been Out alone in the forest with my dogs.
When I could see the sun I could steer my
course by it. And when night came on I
would build a fire, cook some of my game
and sleep under a tree till morning."
"Once I was attacked by a panther. I
was traveling along the trail about dusk
when the animal sprang on my shoulders
from the limb of a tree over my
head. In a second he had clawed most
of my clothing off my body and was trying
to bite my tnroat â you know panthers
always cut the veins in the neck to drink
the blood. I had my rifle in my left hand
and my six-shooter in my belt, and you bet
I went for that just as soon as I felt him
strike me. I pulled the revolver out and
reaching over mv left shoulder shot the
panther in the head. He let go and tell to
the ground. The two big dogs jumped him
and he whipped them both, badly disabled
as he was. When I got a cnance to use my
six-shooter again 1 broke his back and tuat
ended him.
"I never was sick a day in my life, and
if I could get away from this City I would
start lor the woods again, where I have
lived much of my life and where I could
make my way. I don't know what is the
matter with " Lena, but I am sure that
neither father nor myself have leprosy.
If ever I get back to Mendocino County I
will sue Day for bringing me down here
and the county for burning our house."
This is the story of the lad whom the
authorities of Mendocino said was either
a leper, insane or was ieeble-minded, and
must be shipped to San Francisco to be
come a burden upon the already over
burdened City.
"While the medical experts who have ex
amined the girl are convinced that she is
probably suffering from leprosy, they are
not able to determine just what is the
matter with the boy.
They think that he has neuresthenia, a
nervous complaint, either inherited or
brought on by one of a number of possible
causes.
After escaping from the City and County
Hospital, he was arrested in the street and
taken to the City Receiving Hospital,
where he is now confined. In all San Fran
cisco there is no place for the unfortunate
lad. Neither hospital nor the Pesthouse
will have him, and the Commissioners of
Insanity find him too rational for an asy
lum. It is thought by the authorities that
in return for Mendocino's gratuitous gift of
the boy to this City he might be sent
back to that county with thanks. The
family came from the State of Washington
to Mendocino several years ago and have
lived there ever sinee â long enough to
have acquired a residence in that county.
Young Grim's father is probably now in
that locality and can support himself and
son in the wooas with rifle and ax, if the

Among the letters received by Miss

glowing and triumphant terms, stating
that Madera County had been completely
organized for the campaign, there being

cured a contract with a grocery firm and a
laundry company to do their shipping,
and Frank Darling rowed out to the
launch where she lay off Long Bridge
last evening to see that she was in good
order. He made fast his boat and stepped
below, but as he opened the cabin door
there came an explosion that blew him
backward into the water and wrecked the
launch.
Darling, though badly shaken up by the
explosion, rose to the surface almost im
mediately, only to find that the snrface of
thÂ« water had been covered with burning
gasoline, and that he was swimming about
in the midst of it.
He dove at once and swam under water
for some distance, but he had to come to
the surface twice before he got outside the
circle of naming oil. Then a boat, which
attracted by tne explosion had put off
from shore, picted him up.
In the meantime the launch had been
burning merrily and to save her the rescu
ing boat came alongside and knocked a
hole in her.
The explosion without doubt was caused
by the gasoline tank. It was situated in
the bow of the boat and had been filled
only the day before. It is supposed that
some leak allowed the oil to escape, and
this generating gas in the cabin caused an
explosion when the door was opened. Or
it may be the sun shining through the
cabin windows had heated the gas gener
ated to such a degree that it was exploded
just in time to catch the boatman as he
opened the door.
The cabin was blown to atoms and the
lannch was set on fire. The oil from the
tank had been scattered through a radius
of twenty feet and was being slowly borne
by the tide toward some valuable yachts
lying near by, the little patches of greasy
fluid blazing merrily as they danced along.
The yacht 3 were quickly moved out of
harm's way, however, and the flaming oil
burned harmlessly un-til it went out.
Darling was down at the wharf yester
day superintending the raising of his boat.
Hs was considerably shaken up by the ex
plosion, but otherwise was not badly hurt.
"That was the narrowest escape from
death I ever had in my life," said he.
"The thing occurred so suddenly that I
didn't know what struck me.
"I had just made a contract with a
Sixth-street grocery firm and a laundry
company to do their shipping and was
just going to get the boat in shape to start
in immediately, but I no sooner had the
cabin door half open than I received a
terrible shock and knew no more until I
found myself in the water, whose surface
was one mass of burning oil and terribly
hot.
"I knew it would De folly to undertake
to swim through it on the surface, but by
a succession of short dives, and swimming
under water, I got out in safety. I was
rendered assistance just in time, for swim
ming with my clothes on weakened me
and I couldn't have gone much longer.
"It was a clear case of spontaneous com
bustion, and although I ordered the best
quality of gasoline tank I was given a
defective one and through this the acci
dent was caused, but I am glad to have es
caped with my life."
CEMETERY IN THE ROAD
Western Addition Improvement Club
Desires the Calvary Cemetery Wall
Moved Back Five Feet.
At a regular meeting last evening of the
Western Addition Improvement Club at
Coakley's Hall oh Geary street, near Cen
tral avenue, a communication was ordered
to be forwarded to the Board of Super
visors complaining of the action of the
Sutro Railroad Company, and asking
them to compel said road to comply with
the terms of its franchise in making the
intersection cf Geary street and Central
avenue its terminal point instead of Sutter
street and Central avenue.
It was stated by Colonel Coakley that
last Friday, during a stoppage of the Sut
ter-street line, people vere obliged to walk
down to Geary street, and pay an extra
fare in order to get to town.
A communication was also ordered to be
forwarded to the Board of Supervisors,
appealing to them to assist the good work
of the Board of Health by allowing them a
liberal appropriation, such as was asked by
the Merchants' Association, for more
thorough food inspection and the estab
lishing of the four inspection stations for
this purpose.
A communication was ordered to be
sent to the Board of Supervisors calling
their attention to the wall inclosing the
Calvary Cemetery on the south side of
Geary street, between St. Joseph avenue
and Central avenue, running west. It is
claimed that this wall occupies five feet of
the public thoroughfare and should be re
moved back to the surveyed line of the
Cemetery property proper. The wall of
the cemetery on Geary street lying west
of Central avenue has recently been
moved back five feet. The remaining por
tion is the only obstruction of this por
tion of Geary street.
The attention of Superintendent Ash
| worth was also called to this matter, ask
ing him to direct his attention in his
official capacity toward remedying this
evil.
