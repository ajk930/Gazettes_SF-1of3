BOTH DEAD, AND BY
THE DAUGHTER'S HAND
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper and
Miss Harriet Cooper
Killed by Gas.
INSANITY OF THE GIRL
CAUSED THE DEED.
I
Previous Attempts to Do the
Same Thing Had Been Made
by the Daughter.
TRAGICAL ENDING OF TWO WELL
KNOWN LIVES.
Mrs. Cooper Was Widely Known as a Religious
Worker, Philanthropist and Founder
of Kindergartens.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, the well-known
philanthropist, and her daughter, Miss
Harriet Cooper, were found dead in their
bedroom at the family residence, 1902 Val
lejo street, yesterday morning. The
Chinese servant found the bodies.
Death was caused by asphyxiation from
illuminating gas, and all the circumstan
ces indicate that the daughter deliberately
ended her life and that of her mother
while suffering from mental depression of
a character hereditary with Her father's I
family.
The discovery of the fact of tho tragedy
ipii made by \Vone Louie, the family ser
vant, who haii been employed by Mrs.
Cooper for nearly fifteen years. When he
awoke he smelled gas and traced it to the
fbfdrooni where Mrs. and Miss Cooper
slept. On opening the door he found both j
dead, whereupon lie notified the neighbors,
and the Coroner wa3 soon informed.
"I found that a will had been left," said |
Coroner Hawkins, "and I allowed the i
bodies to remain at the residence, as I had ,
a right to do under the liw."
In a few hours Mrs. George T. Gaden, i
Mrs. W. E. Hale and other friends of the j
dead wereupon the scene. They directed
the servants about the hou3e to stow !
away the furniture and belongings of the j
room, and Mrs. Gsden refused to admit ,
newspaper men until they came with a |
Deputy Coroner, assuming ihat "the trag
edy was a private affair and not tne busi
ness of tne public."
It transpired a few hours after the
tragedy that Miss Harriet Cooper had
rrobably been insane for more than a year.
It was mown to a few friends that she
once or twice attempted to kill herself and
her mother in a similar way. A story to
that effect was told by Dr. Sidney
yesterday, ancf Mrs. Cooper asked him to
mate the facts public should a tragedy
ever occur.
A wonderul insight into the life of the
Coopers may be obtained by reading a
letter of Mrs. Cooper, written to her sister
ii) Brooklyn on November 29. By some
atrange delay the letter was not sent, but

it was found on a table yesterday morning
addressed to Mrs. J. A. Skelton. 444 Han
cock street, Brooklyn, N. Y. It sliows the
deep trouble of the mother over her De
loved child's insanity and illness, and
practically foreshadows the tragedy. It is
as follows:
San Francisco. Cal., Nov. 29, 189 G.
My Darling Sister Hattie: You are anxious all
the time about our precious one. bhe is no
letter. Bhe complains of great paiu in toer
k i.ead-a bad symptom. I have told our physi- j

Wha case is serious. From the first the darling

Oh, precious sister, only God knows the agony
of my mother's heart. I told dear Mrs. Hale
and Mrs. Gaden everything. 1 cannot talk to
others. 1 hope every day that a change for
the better will come. Hattie has not been
wÂ«il for a year, but she has kept at work, bo
have I. We have tried to do goodâ to make
the little ones brighter and happier. The

is constantly in my mind. God is my onl
refuge. I place ray head -on his dear hear
and find my only comfort there. Some day
| darling papa and Hatiie, and ttie little boys,
â¢ and sweet -little Mary and myself will all be
j grouped again. | We shall then understand the
I dreadful mysteries ot this mortal life. . I will
add to this letter before I mail it. Tenderly
and affectionately, Your Sister Satie.
Your devoted mother-sister always.
I know that lor over a ear darling Ilattie
has had symptoms of insanity, but I would
rather d:e than see her in . an nsyium. I will
care for her to the lastâ my precious child. "
It is the twilight of the evening of a lovely
Sabbath day. J. have been nursing- the dear .
one all day; have been reading to her from
Phlilips sermons and from the precious
Bible and '.'Dolly Needs." She is now resting.
She did not sleep at ail last niÂ«ht,. poor child.
Everybody is kind. If only thÂ« tieh and'the
happy know, the good they do by ministering
where sorrow and trouble lie -heavy on the
heart. My poor, exhausted brain surges with
pain. | I have lost so much sleep; that I feel
dizzy and confused. ..I have been nursing, her
to-day as if she were * little child. Her one

I tell her the dear Father,. who is love, will
take care of all that, and when he is ready for
us he will call us. The darling has paroxysms
of great suffering in her head,. then she rallies
and it seems as if health were close at hand.
J She cannot bear me out of her sight, and I do
j not l?are her. Darling sister, we are planning
to accept your urgent invitation and pay you
the visit you bo much desire us to pay this
winter. I will write you in lull when we de
cide. Will add a line in the morning and
send the latest news of the precious child.
Tenderly, your sister, {'â  ., Satie.
Have just read the 23d psalm and the 14th
of St. Joan. I feel greatly comforted. Good
night, dear sister. I just told Hattie that she
was Hod's dear childâ that 1 gave her to him
before she was born, and with my first prayer
when she was born. I know he will hold her
in his hand.
You know Hattie's nature was all bright
ness and sunshine; she has been deeply de
spondent and sad, but says she knows not
why. I know it is from overwork.
We are both greatly overworked. Life is a
battle. We must be heroes. God is our helper.
Another document that throws great
light on the case, revealing the mother's
fear of death, is her will, made in October,
it was written by herself and runs as
follows:

day as above dated. We leave for the country
to-morrow. Sarah B. Cooper.
The fact that Miss Cooper was practi
cally insane was known to but few of her
lriends, and her mother guarded the
secret with the greatnst care and surren
dered her life by continuing to sleep with
the child whom she knew had a mania to
end her life and take her mother alonj:.
The history of the previous attempts is
best known to the family pnysician.
It was bnt natural that, with the ten
acity of groundless hope, Dr. Sidney
Worth, the family physician, should have
been hastily summoned to the bedside of
the women who had been his patients and
his friends. It was 8 o'clock when he ar
rived â hours after the lime when his skill
might have thwarted the subtle agency of
death. He viewed the bodies lying side by
side as in sleep. But to the trained eye of
tho physician their quietness meant mora
than sleep.
"It it over," he said. And the friends
knew thai there had passed from their
midst those whom they had learned to
love and revere.
"It is somewhere between six and eight
months," said Dr. Worth yesterday after
noon, "since I was first called upon to at
tend Mias Hattie. She wa's suffering from
melancholia, with a tendency toward sui
cide â what you would call suicidal melan
cholia. Mrs. Cooper toid me it was
hereditary in her husband's family. Her
husband, as you know, committed suicide,
as did two of his cousins and an uncle.
With Miss Hattie the tendency was very
marked. She was constantly talking of
taking her own life. She had absolutely
no cause to be despondent. Physically
s-he was strong and hardy. There was
nothing to worry her. She had every
thing she could reasonably wish. Yet
during the time I have attended her this
morbid desire seemed almost constantly
with her in varying degrees.
" 'I am tired,' she used to say; 'I waut
to end it all, I want to go away and take
you with me, mother.' I warned her
mother repeatedly against the danger she
was running in living alone with her
daughter while she was in this condition.
Tsvice her daughter has attempted the
act which terminated fatally last ni^bt.
She arose from her bed on these occasions
when she thought her mother sound
asleep, surreptitiously *he glided toward
the gas jet and was in the act of turning
on toe gas.when Mrs. Cooper detected her.
"With difficulty Mr*. Cooper would dis
suade her daughter from her deadly pur
pose. Even after these attempts, both of
which occurred during the last three
months, Mrs. Cooper could not be per-
Buaded to place her daughter in an insti
tution where she could be safely and
properly treated. Always she hoped and
believed that the great love which existed
between her daughter and herself would
protect her from the influence of the fatal
manic. Her fears seemed all for her
daughter. She sought the power of argu
ment to counteract her daughter's suicidal
tendency.
'â¢'You have no right to take your own
life,' she would say to her unfortunate
daughter 'it was given to you by an allwise
Providence, and in him only is the right
to take it away.' At such times the argu
ment would apparently prevail, or at leHSt
Miss Hattie made no attempt to reply
to it.
"At one time we talked before her of
-ending her to an institution in Ban
Mateo County. The idea was distressing
to Miss Hattie and also to Mrs. Cooper. I
warned Mrs. Cooper that she was not well
enough to nurse her daughter. She was

losing sleep nightly and her fragile con
stitution could not hold up under it. To
my advice she replied, 'My daughter is all
I have to live for. I will give my life to
her, but I cannot bear to part from her.'
"During the last four months the mania
has been increasing. Miss Hattie bas
spent most of her time in bed, althoueh
physically there was nothing the matter
with her. She simply wanted to be left
alone and quiet. J called in almost every
day, though there was little to be done. I
constantly warned Mrs. Cooper against
the great risks of being alone with her
daughter.
" 'Some day,' I would say, 'you will fail
to wake when she turns on the jjas, or per
haps she will lay violent hands upon
MISS HARRIET COOPER.
yon.' But the mother'e Jove was proof
against all my advice. Sometimes the
rear of approaching insanity would come
upon the daughter. Once I heard her say,
â¢ca/i Ibe going insane?' It is difficult to
say how much this fear may have aggra
vated her condition.
"With my knowledge of the circum
stances I, of course, was not greatly sur
prised when I ascertained what had oc
curred. I hastened to the residence, but
both had been dead many hours; how
many it was impossible to say. Both were
lying as though asleep, except that Mrs.
Cooper's jaw had dropped as though with
an expiring gasp. The condition of her
body showed that she had been dead con
siderably longer than the younger woman.
This would indicate, as I believe to be
absolutely unquestionably the case, that
Miss Hattie arose while her mother was
in a profound sleep â more than usually
profound on account of her weaknessâ
and turned on the gas.
"The end came sooner to the elder lady.
She was constitutionally delicate and
work and worry had reduced her vitality.
Moreover to one asieep the effects of gas
come sooner than to one who, haying the
senses awake, rights off perhaps involun
tarily the deadly stupor.' 1
Dr. Worth declares that the theory he
gives of the catastrophe is as certainly
correct as anything can be. It was, he
declares, precisely what was to be ex-
pected and in view of the family history
of the girl on her father's side would
scarcely have been remarkable had the
previous attempts of the young lady been
unknown.
"Mrs. Cooper always requested me," he
said, ''in case anything happened to ber
throueh her daughter to make this heredi
tary tendency public. It was right and
just to her that it should be so." .
KNOWN TO FRIENDS.
Mrs. Gaden and Mrs. Hale Tell ofj
Previous Attorn pts.
Before the news of the awful tragedy
was being whispsred in horror about the
busy streets the loving hands of Mrs.
Cooper's nearest friends, Mrs. George T.
Gaden and Mrs. W. E. Hale, wife of
Warden Hale, were doing the few kind
offices that remain for friends to minister
to their cherished dead. To these friends,
both of whom have been tne advisers and
supporters of Mrs. Cooper in her labors
and the sharers in her trials aud triumphs,
the blow was heavy, yet neither was
wholly unprepared for the awful happen
ing. As the afternoon wore on Mrs.
Gaden became prostrated, but Mrs. Halo
maintained her position as temporary
mistress of the abode of death with re
markable fortitude. For a time she
sought to draw a veil of privacy about the
tragic affair, but later, fearful lest some
thins: of mystery might attacb to the
death of her friends, she consented to tell
everything she knew in regard to it.
"There is no mystery about this affair
at all," she declared. "Miss Hattie has
been addicted to this mania for months
to toy knowledge and recently she con
fessed she had been aware of it lor a year,
but had striven to battle aeainst it.
"This mania is hereditary with her.
Her father killed himself without an
apparent reason. He was of a bright and
cheerful nature always, enthusiastic in
his aid of Mrs. Cooper and happy in his
domestic life. One day he escorted his
wife and daughter to church. They
stayed to Sunday-school and when ihey
returned he was dead.
"Mrs. Cooper did not know then that
insanity was hereditary in his family. I
think it was only about a year ago when
she first learned that three of her hus
band's relatives had committed suicide.
The letter which apprised her of this fact
unfortunately fell into the hands of Miss
Hattie. From :hat moment the young
woman considered herself doomed. Mrs.
Cooper was grieved that her daughter
should have seen this letter, but Hattie
acted as her mother's secretary and re
ceived the letter before her mother had
seen it.
"During the last four months Hattie's
condition has been very serious aud it has
weighed heavily upon her mother. She
could not bear to tnink of putting her in
an asylum. The hope was constantly in
her mind that her daughter would re
cover and be nil right again.
"Tne intention to commit suicide was
firmly fixed In Hattie's mind and she al
ways said she would take her mother
with ber. Twice she made actual at
tempts to carry out her threat that I
know of. Her mother detected her both
times in the act of turning on the gas.
When Mrs. Cooper tried to make her de
sist in each instance a struggle ensued. I
don't mean to say a cruel struggle, but
the daughter tr.ed to prevent her lrom
interfering.
"A short time ago Mrs. Cooper and
Hattie spent a week at my home at San
Quentin. While there Hattie promised
us that she would never take her mother's
life. That was when she was sane, but
nightly while ti.ey were there the insane
periods recurred. They seemed always to
come between 1 and 4 o'clock in the morn
ing. Then Mrs. Cooper would be awake
and argue and soothe her dan hter until
the force of the mania had passed away.
"About a month ago I persuaded Mrs.
Cootier that she should write and tell her
sister, as tenderly as possible, of her daugh
ter's misfortune. She dreaded having

ally wrote the letter which has been piven

relations existed between them, though
their views were so greatly opposed.

MORE PROOF OF THE BIG
CONSPIRACY.
Julian Says That Long Green
Lawrence Fixed Gibbs to
Appoint Earp.
LYNCH .WANTED NOBODY BUT
THE BAD MAN.
An Eastern Opinion cf the Examiner's
Referee â Long Green Tries to
BulMose a Baseball Team.
Long Green Andy Lawrence, managing
editor of the Examiner, true to his black
mailing, bulldozing instincts, after having
been exposed for his unfair treatment of
the Tufts- Lyons baseball team attempted
to force Manager Aschner to write are
traction of the charges against him. Upon
Aschner refusing to do so the managing
editor informed Mr. Aschner that hia
team would get the worst or it hereafter.
In other words the team was to be bull
dozed by the Examiner.
This episode is in keeping with a news
paper which when the citizens of Pasa
dena a few days ago declined to subscribe
the money required by the Examiner for
a write-up of that town published a fake
dispatch to the effect that the town had
been devastated by a cyclone, thus ho- ing
to injure the people of Pasadena by scaring
immigration and capital away from it.
It has been ascertained that between 6
and 8 o'clock of the evening of the fight a
lip was given out to a iew favored indi
viduals to the effect that Sharkey would
be awarded the victory, right or wrong,
and that Fi'zsimmons would be done up,
not by Sharkey, but by the decision.
Those who were so fortunate as to receive
the tip hurried to Harry Corbett's pool
rooms Bnd placed their money on Sharkey
so that they might hedge out of the bet.
The tip proved to be correct.
Peop'e are now asking why was Sharkey
kept dh hour in the dressing-room, and
why the press reporters and many physi
cians among the spectators were not al
lowed to examine him?
It is argued that if Sharkey were fouled
the sooner the physicians and others were
allowed to inspect the injury the better it
would be for Sharkey, as there would then
be no doubt whatever es to the foul. If
this course bad been pursued no one
would have enjoined the stase money,
and there would have been no dispute in
the courts.
Attorney Kowalsky said to-day that he
had ten or eleven witnesses to prove the
existence of the conspiracy and the fact
that Earp had been chosen as a suitable
tool to do their bidding. He added that
the evidence would be stronger and more
direct than any that had yet been offered
in court
Julian said to a Call reporter that the
witnesses would show the connection of
Long Green Lawrence with conspiracy,
and the fact that it was he who had in
duced Gibbs to secure the appointment of
Bodyguard Earp as referee.
It will be shown also by the best of evi
dence that Dan Lynch told the sporting
editor of one of the newspapers before the
light that the Sbarkey crowd would ob
ject to every referee that might be named
by the Fitzsimmons people, and that they
would have a referee of th;ir own choos
ing appointed by the club.
The following named gentlemen were
proposed to Lynch as suitable material
out of which a referee might be chosen :
Hiram Cook, Lena Fulda, Eddie Graney,
Robert McArthur, W. W. Naughton, Al
Herford and Billy Jordan. Each of these
gentlemen is well known and has a good
reputation for honesty and integrity.
But that was not the hind of a referee
that Lynch and Long Green wanted.
They had Earp up their sleeve and were
determined to play him for all he was
worth.
Concerning the fight and the moral to be
deduced from it, Hugh Keough has the
following to say in ihe New Orleans Item :
Boxing has been killed on the coast at the
outset of its second boom. It was hoped that
when the promoters .of the game were granted
a measure of license after a long period of en
forced idlenew they would avoid the mistakes
that closed San Francisco to the glove men
four years ago. But they haven't. The same
grasping greed, the same old meretrcious spirit
and the seme old subversion of honesty to
serve :elfish ends; the same unscrupulous
grafters who ran a sick man to his death

was a little dirty money in it, have had the
management of affairs. They have had two
chances to foul their own nests, and they
have accepted them. The legitimate profits of
the Corbett-Sharkey tness were enormous, but
they were not sufficient. The temptation to
cheat a party of strangers was too great. They
loathed the idea of letting that $10,000 purse
get out of the State, and, worse than that, the
thought of giving Grannan and other big bet
tors from the Ea.it an honest ruu for their
money could not be entertained for a moment.
With them a crooked dollar iv hand is worth

"I have a passing acquaintance with Wyatt
Earp, the man who refereed the fight, and
sDeaks so toplofticatly about his honor in the
dispatch which follows this. I never dreemt |
of him in connection with refereeing a fist
fight upon which a championship possibly
depended, altnough he might be qualified to
adjudicate upon the fine points arising in a
bowie-knife duel. He comes of a family who
kill and was until he got civilization, so to
speak, by the San Francisco route, a more or
less picturesque border character, with a
reputation of a killer. He gunned his way
into notoriety in Indian Territory and Arizona
bjfore he went to San Francisco with a halo ol
blue smoke about his head. With all its
boasted progress San Francisco worships a gun
tighter as devotedly now as it did in '49. If
Earp has the reputation for squareness that he
boasts about I presume he acquired it in the
same way Alkali Ikes and Rattlesnake Jims
acquired theirs â by boring holes in persons
who had made assertions to the contrary. If
one man accuses another of being h horse
thief the accuser may fully vindicate htmsell
and Etand before the world as an honest man
by simply blowing the brains out of his
accuser according to the ethics of the society
in which Wyatt Earp has mingled. We look at
thiugrs differently on this side of the divide.
Here we do not necessarily hold a man guilt
less of horse-stealing because he has killed his
man. Earp is regarded as a 'square man' in
San Francisco because he has several notches
on his stick and is still quick on the draw.
"His knowledge of boxing must be limited.
In his heart he must despise a man who de
per.ds upon nature's weapons to "defend him
self. He has the reputation of being game, but
the chances are that if you unstrapped the
stock of blue hardware from his hips 'One
eyed' Connolly could make him jump out of a
window."
TWO VIEWS OF WYATT EARP
FROM MR. HEARST'S NEWSPAPERS
The Kind of Man Whom Long Green Andy Lawrence of the
Examiner Thought Good Enough to Referee the
Fitzsimmons-Sharkey Fight.
Wyatt Earp must now be 45 years old. He is grim, game and deadly. He
nÂ»ver took water. But he doesn't kill as he used to. Age has cooled his blood,
many wounds have brought caution. Moreover, the communities he honors witn
his presence won't siand those gayeties which marked Wyatt Earp's earlier
career. And Wyatt has grown to like a quiet life. As a result, he has not taken a
scalp for year 3.
His business just now should be that of a blackleg gambler â crooked as a
dog's hind le,;. If there are any honest hairs in his Head they have grown since
he left Arizona. He is exactly the sort of man to referee a prize-fight if a steal is
meditated and a job put up to make the wrong man win. Wyatt Earp has all of
the nerve and dishonesty needed to turn the triqk. The mere name of Wyatt
Earp as refeiee shows that Fitzsinimons was against a hard game. â Alfred
Lewis in Mr. Hearst's New York Journal.

practical in all things, and attended to
the practical side of their lives. Her be
liefs, however, were the same as her
mother's."
A LOVER OF INGERSOLL.
The Dead Girl Read Her Relative's
Book*.
Those Jwho knew Miss Harriet Cooper
best say she was not a religious woman in
the sense that her mother was. The
mother was a cousin of Coionel Robert G.
Ingersoll, whose works were read by the
daughter. One of the books she was fond
of was "Is Suicide a SinT" passages from
which, it is said, made a deep impression
on her mind.
The book is a somewhat morbid plea for
suicide in certain cases. The following
pa-sages from the work probably appealed
to the girl :
In the room of the busy world the cry of the
despondent Is not heard. Death becomes his
only friend. Death promises release from
want, ironi hunger and pain, and so tne poor
wretch lays down his burden, dashes it from
his shoulders and falls asleep. To tne this all
seems very natural. Tne wonder is that so
many endure and suffer to the natural end;
thiit so many nurse the spark of Hie in hut*
and prisons, keep it and gu>>.r<l it through
years oi misery and want, support it by beg
gary, by eating the crust found in the gutter,
and to whom it only gives days ot weariness
and nights of fear and dread; why should the
man, sitting amid the wreck of all he had, the
loved ones dead, friends lost, seek to lengthen,
to preserve his life? What can the iuture have
for him?
Under many circumstances a maji has a
right to kill himseli. When life is of no value
to him, when he cun be ot no real assistance
to others, why should a man oontinue? When
he is of no benefit, when he ts a burden to
those he loves, why should he remain ?
In many passages of the fatuous work
of Insersoll such expressions as these
occur; "A little morphine would eive the
sufferer sleep â the agony would be forgot
ten and he would pass unconsciously from
happy dreams to painless death."
HER DAUGHTER'S MIND.
Two Weeks AÂ«o Mrs. Cooper Said
It Was Sound.
The rumor that Miss Hattie Cooper had
gone insane was first circulated about the
time that Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper wrote
from a sanitarium at St. Helena to the
ladies in charge of the suffrace campaign,
statins that in consequence of her daugh
ter's state of health she was unable to be
present in San Francisco during the elec
tion. By the time, about two weeks ago,

what Mrs. Cooper loved to call her "vine
embowered home on Vallejo street" the
rumor of Miss Cooper't unfortunate con
dition bad gained such widespread cred
ence among Mrs. Cooper's friends that she
was asked by a representative of The Call
whether Miss Cooper's state of heaith was
so serious as it was reported 10 be.
The great kindergartener was in her
library adjoining her daughter's room at
the time. She looked pule and worn out,
as if from overmuch watchintr, but she
was continuing ncr correspondence as
Usual.
"My daughter's mind has never suffered
in ihe least during her illness," said Mrs.
Cooper, who seemed pained and intensely
surprised that there :â  hould be any ques
tion of Miss Cooper's nervous prostration
having affected her mentally. "Hattie
has been working very hard," continued
Mr-. Cooper. 'Not only has she had
her own kindergarten work to attend to,
but she has done a great deal of work in
connection with the suffrage campaign.
She toured part of the State with Miss
Anna B. Shaw, and undertook the ardu
ous trip to Eureka, but as for her mind
being affected that is absurd. She is
ready and anxious to continue her kinder:
The following is from a gentleman in
terested in sporting matters:
To the Sporting Editor of The Call : Pugilistic
ally speaking the evidence regarding the Fitz-
Eim-mons-Sharkey fiasco is becoming decidedly
pointed and interesting, but it may be as well
to suspend judgment lor a while, as, although
lots of us know Sharkey only by repuiation,
yet we consider him too brave a man to stoop
to anything so low as becoming one of a band
of vile conspirators to defraud beforehand a
manly opponent of the laurels of victory and
reward of his skill. Still, if there has been
anything really 'crooked," it is to be hoped,
in the interests of decency and fair play, mat
it be sifted to the botiom and the guilty, who
ever they be, held up to the contempt of every
decent admirer of boxing, even though the re
sult wipe the manly art off this City's list of
sporting attractions completely and forever.
The writer's opportunities lor observing this
contest were as good perhaps as those of any
one, his seat being selected immediately they
were placed on sale and the one chosen being
a gallery "reserve," directly over the ring.
Both men were watched as closely as one
pair of perfect eyes could do so; and although
personally desiring to see Sharkey win, there
were two distinct occasions during that mem
orable contest when every snred of hope on
that score was entire; y abandoned; and then 1
when the eventful eighth occurred, and Fitr
simmons stalked over toward the clock, and
directly faciDg the writer, with his long arms
dangling at his sides and wearing that "what
did-I-tell-you" smile of iiis, I mentally ejacu
lated, "Yes, you got him, didn't you," anal
am positive Fiiz felt he had won. But then,
when the knowledge dawned upon him that
he had lost on a foul, the transformation scene
that swept over the Australian's face was pos
itively painful to a conscientious onlooker to
witness; and 1 telt convinced, then and there,
that if Fitzsimmons had fouled Sharkey, It
was so far unintentional that he (Fitz) was
una'wareof it. I certainly detected none, but
it doesn't follow there wasn't any.
Apropos of Sharkey's idea published so
prominently in one of the yesterday morning
papers, that Fitz would be comparatively easy
game for Corbett, Sharkey surely must have
been joking, there beiu* little real doubt but
that after Fltz's disposal of Sharkey the other
evening-, he was stiil in a condition to have
given Pompadour Jim the fight of bis life,
without any interlude or intermission what
ever before proceeding about it. J. G. B.

garten work as soon as she is stronger.
Her chief trouble is insomnia, which tires
her, but has never affected her mind."
In order to show how sane her daughter
was Mrs. Cooper led the way to Hattie's
room. The invalid was lying 04 her bed,
propped up with pillows, but she seemed
bright and cheerful and conversed readily
about her regret at not being in town dur
ing the election. Durinjj the course of con
versation Mrs. Cooper showed a letter
which she had recently received from St.
Louis, from a lady signing herself Bessie
L. Robinson. "She refers to a lecture 1
gave two years ago in St. Louis, and asks
for some of the statistics I gave then about
Kindergarten work," said Mrs. Cooper, and
she added : "It is always sue 1 a pleasure
to receive these letters, snowing the in
terest that people feel in the work. If you
think that this one will be ot any use for
publication 1 will lend it to you."
"Mother, before letting it go see that
you have the right address, because it
must be arswered and the reporter might
forget to return it," said Miss Hattie
Cooper in such a thoroughly practical and
matter-of-faci way that it was difficult to
imagine that she had any mental afflic
tion.
"You see," said Mrs. Cooper, after leav
ing her daughter's room, "how utterly
baseless is any rumor that Hattie is in
sane. She is not strong enough to see
visitors, but I let you see her because I
was anxious to show that she is as sane as
any of us. Hattie is simply run down
with overwork, but I hope and pray she
will soon be strong and well again, and in
the meantime I do not consider it my
duty to take uny part in public life while
my child needs nursing at home; but
Hattie is as sane as I am."
THE SHADOW OF DOOM.
Mrs. Cooper's Last Kind Thought of
a Sister's Need.
A tender little story cam? to me to-day
that told of the kind heart of the woman
that passed away leaving no word or line
to tell the story of her death. Her sudden
departure has been a great snock to those
wno knew and loved her, It has been a
greater one, perhaps, to those who have
been benefited by the kind and charitable
deeds that have identified her throughout
her bu'-y life.
Three weens ago a young girl who was
greatly iv need of help went to Mrs. Coop
er's home on Vallejo street and asked to
see her. She came down to the parlor
where the girl was waiting. The motherly
face, framed in gray hair, touched the
homesick heart of the girl and she con
tided to Mrs. Cooper her whole story. She
told of her long weeks of hopeless seeking
for work and oi the many discouraging
failures, of wanl and of longing for home.
"What can I do for you, dear?" asked
Mrs. Cooper kindly.
"I want work, Mrs. Cooper," answered
the gin.
"What can you do?"
"Well," said the girl, "I have never
gone out to .-ervice; I shouldn't like to do
that; but I though c you might hear of
some one who would like a companion. I
have been so discouraged that I have even
thought of suicide."
Mrs. Cooper walked over and sat down
beside the girl and took her hands. "Not
that, not that," she said. "You must not.
give up. When once we give up, you
Know, then all is lost. You must try to
be brave. A young woman has a bar i
time of it alone in the City.''
For an hour they chatted, in the dusk
of tbe evening, the young woman A'ho
had thought of suicide and the older one
who had infinite pity for her. Mrs.
Cooper explained during their conversa
tion that her daughter's health would not
permit of her leaving her for any length
of time, but she agreed to do all that lay
in her power for the girl. She took the
girl's card and wrote a few explanatory
words below tbe name.
Then the girl left, followed by the mem
ory of a sweet, kind face. Two weeks
passed and the girl alone and without
work had begun to despair of ever hear
ing from Mrs. Cooper, when one day she
received a note. "My dear girl," it ran,
"I have found a place for you. I am
afraid that you have feit forgotten, but I
have been very busy. Will you call?"
Buoyed up again by nope the girl went
yesterday morning to Mrs. Cooper's home.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1896.
It was only then that she heard of the
terrible tragedy.
When a prominent person dies little
episodes or reminiscences connected with
his or her life that never otherwise would
receive attention are brought to light.
This story told me by the girl herself
seems worthy of commemoration.
"The evil that men do lives after them;
the good is often interred with their
bones," says Shakespeare, but it does not
always follow. Mac Gates.
THE FATHER'S DEATH.
Halsey F. Cooper* Tragic Suicide
Ascribed to Impulsive Insanity.
The suicide of Halsey F. Cooper, hus
band of Sarah B. Cooper, which occurred!
on December 6, 1885, in its incidents sug
gests strongly the same condition of mind
which must have been tbe unhappy heir
loom of his daughter during the months
that she sought the life of herself and her
mother. In the case of the father, how
ever, there were well-defined reasons for
his discontent and discouragement.
Mr. Cooper bad for a great many years
been Deputy Surveyor of the Portâ so
The Chamber in which Mrs* Sarah B. Cooper and Her Daughter Harriet Were Found Dead
Yesterday Morning.
long that he and bis family bad come to
look upon the situation as a settled source
of income for life. In 1884 came the
change in administration and soon after
Cleveland's inauguration Cooper was let
out.
He was 58 years of age. All the years of
his maturity had been spent in public ser
vice and he felt that ho was unfitted for
anything else. To ndd to iiis embarrass
ment there was a 14000 mortgage upon his
property at 1902 Vallejo street. A flooded
sewer inflicted damage to his property
which demanded an immediate outlay of
cash and he had nothing with which to
meet the demand.
His friends, and they were many, per
ceiving the magnitude of his cures, de
cided to testify their appreciation of the
many exemplary qualities of himself and
wife, and commenced a subscription to
pay off tne mortgage. They were par
tially successful, but the relief came too
late.
It was Sunday and the husband excused
his non-attendance at church by pleading
the prevalence of burglaries in the neigh
borhood.
He escorted his wife and daughter to
the car ami himself returned to the
house. Wtien the ladies returned from
Sunday-School, whicn followed the morn
ing service, tney found Cooper appar
ently asleep on a sota. They strove to
wake him. He was dead.
Investigation showed he bad taken the
contents of a four-ounce bottle of carbolic
acid. He left a note to his wife and
daughter which was affectionate in the
extreme. He recounted their love, truth
and fidelity to i.im, but stated they would
be better off without him. "Softening of
the brain, old age creeping on and pauper
ism is more than lean endure," he wrote.
"Your lives, so useful and so noble,
should not be burdened by one who de
votedly loves you but who has failed to
provide."
THE "BAD MAN" REFEREE.
[Reproduced from the Hew York Herald.]
The subscription to lift the mortgage
was raised one week after. Mrs. Cooper
died in the same bouse which had been
the death scene of her husband.
Friends who remember Mr. Cooper well
say that his daughter was like him in
action, temperament and feature. At the
time of his death nothing was known of
his hereditary taint, but a Coroner's jury
brought in a verdict of "impulsive insan
ity." The softening of the brain to which
he referred was imaginary.
MRS. COOPER'S CAREER.
Known Everywhere as a Brave and
Ambltlou9 Leader.
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper was known
throughout the civilized world as a woman
of great energy and ambition in educa
tional and religious matters. She was
pre-eminently the mostdistinpuished Cali
fornia woman in the line of charitits and
the peculiar phases of educational work
embraced in kindergarten efforts. At
every woman's congress she was the most
honored of guests, being a woman of fine
address, wide culture ana admirable at
tainments.
Her unfortunately afflicted daughter
was her constant companion and aman
uensis, and was almost as widely known
as the mother, whose death was the result
of her insanity.
Sarali B. Cooper was born in Cazenovia,
N. V., in 1834. bhe was given a good
education, anrt was trained in th* faith of
the Presbyterian church. After her mar
riage, which was at the age of 20, she went
to Tennessee witn herhusoand, Halsev F.
Cooper, where she was deeply interested
in the slavery question, and devoted a
great deal oi hÂ»i energy to trying to ac
complish the abolition of the institution.
Her daughter. Hattie, was born at Mom
phis in 1856, and .was consequently 40 years
of age.
When Mrs. Cooper married Halsey Fen
nimore Cooper he was a professor in the
seminary of Cazenovia. They lived hap
pily until ten years ago, when he com
mitted suicide- while suffering from im
pulsive insanity.
The following extracts from an account
of the dead woman's iife work was pre
pared by one who knew ncr well and was
intimately acquainted with her life-work:
Her energies were mainly devoted to kinder
garten work. The Pioneer Kindergarten in
this City was founded by her. Mrs. Leland
Stanford and other wealthy* women were ncr
patronesses Mid such wns their confidence In
her that she could always command their
finrtiic.ul aid when she hud a good work to
carry through. After the Pioneer Kindergar
ten had been established Mrs. Cooper founded
others. Six months ngo she staled that she
was an officer oi nineteen societies for the
prosecution of charitable work. Generally she
was the president, sometimes vice-president or
secretary, butulwaysshe was the moving spirit
of ihe undertaking whatever it was.
In this work Bhe was ably assisted by her
daughter, Harriet. Miss Cooper was her
mother's mainstay. She waÂ« beloved with an
undivided affection, which never failed to be
the subject oJ remark by all who observed the
two together. Miss Harriet was her mother's
secretary, her child, her companion and her
shadow. When the mother retired at night
the dn lighter retired also; when she arose
Miss Cooper arose.
The dey was passed together. Their devo
tion to each othpr was something more than
the love of the ordinary mother and daughter.
It was engrossing and imssionate.
It was especially tried when Mrs. Cooper
found herself face to face with a repugnant
duty in connection with her church. She was
a leading member of the First Congregational
Church, and one of the first of the congrega
tion to be made aware of the unworthlness of
the pastor, the Rev. Charles O. Brown. Peo
ple who regarded her as a mentor, told her of
the preacher's unritnoss to fill the pulpit, and
she conceived it to be her duty to act for the
right, whatever might ensue. When the great
church scandal broke out and the City was
rent with animosities growing out of the fight
of the factions, Mrs. Cooper took a firm stand
and remained steadfast to the last. She be
lieved Dr. Brown guilty, and not all the male
dictions, the threats and the malevolent gos
sip of liis partisans could prevent her from as
serting thai he was not worthy to guide the
flock of which he was the chosen leader.
In this controversy Miss Cooper was as
sailed, and her mother flew to her defense.
The assaults made upon the mother were
likewise warded off by the daughter. It was
a trying ordeal for them, but it told more on
the younger than the elder. Mrs. Cooper's
serene faith in tne justice of the divine mas
ter wax an armor oi steel against the slings
and arrows of her enemies. Miss Cooper,
though sharing her mother's pious nature,
was not proof against them. They wounded
her and had a perceptible effect on her subse
quent life. She became nervous, deeply irri
tated and despondent It is believed that she
had inherited from her tuther a suicidni ten
dency, for she often spoke of death and wished
for it".
Friends of the Coopers assert that they have
ever dreaded some such termination of their
lives as that whinn has shocked the City to
day. Mrs. Cooper was more content to live
out her allotted span of lite. She knew of her
daughter's desire tor death and deprecated it,
but she herself was always ready lor the end.
She held heiself amenable to the will of the
Creator, but she would not presume to hasten
her tubing of.
In their home life the Coopers were a re
markable couple. They had made themselves
one of the coziest and interesting domiciles to
be found anywhere. It was a charming spot
and reflected tbe character of its occupant!.
Mrs. Cooper and Colonel Robert GÂ»
Ingersoll were cousins and warm personal
friends, in spite of their opposing religious
views. Colonel Ingersoll presented Mrs.
Cooper with a volume of his lectures a
few years ago, with the inscription: "To
Get
Most for your money and nave needless ex-
penses now. It Is true economy to build up
your system and prevent sickness, by taking

my own cousin, Sarah, of whom I will
say if all Christians were like her thie
book would never have been written."
Probably 120 kindergartens have grown
out of the Goiden Gate Kindergarten,
formed by Mrs. Cooper. To her more
than to any one person the people may be
thankful for that modification of the edu
cational system that makes it conform to
day to tbe teachings of the immortal
Froebel.
Mrs. Cooper's well-known Bible cla?s
was organized hi 1880, in the Calvary Pres
byterian Church. In five or six years it
became one of the famous institutions of
the City. Finally she " taught doctrines
that were challenged as heresy by Deacon
Robertson.
The trial was a noted one, and Mrs.
Cooper defended herself so ably as to
attract wide attention The church de
cided against her and she withdrew to the
First Congregational Church, where her
Bible class again became a great factor
and remained such until the outcome of
the famous trial of Key. C. O. Brown.
In the Brown trial Mrs. Cooper was an
important factor.
At first a friend of Dr. Brown she be
came convinced he was wrong, and was
one of the urgent enemies who?e efforts
finally resulted in his downfall. It was to
Mrs. Cooper that Mrs. Stockton made the
confession that was so latal to Dr. Brown.
Mrs. Cooper was president of the
Woman's Congress, and was a leading
spirit in the Pacific Coast Woman's Press
Association. Her correspondence through
out the world was voluminous, and her
death will be felt as a public loss wherever
p ople cherish the name of those who
devote their lives to religion and educa
tion.
GRIEF IN LOS ANGELES.
Mrs. Cooper Highly Commended
for Her Noble Qualities.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 11.â Few
instances of death in this State can be
recalled in Los Angeles to-night which
have occasioned such universal expressions
of regret as that of the untimely taking
off of Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper.
This pure, Christian woman had scores
of dear and loyal friends in this city who
stood by her like a wall of adamant in her
late controversy with Rev. C. O. Brown.
Her friends are among this city's noblest
womanhood, all of whom are deeply
grieved over her death. Sue has been pro
nounced over and over again the noblest
of women and the most unselfish of phil
antrophists. Many of these friends knew of
the sad and melancholy state of Hattie
Cooper's mind and insist that Mrs. Cooper
never committed suicide.
The deceased is commended very highly
for her noble, generous womanhood, but
most of all for her indomitable courage in
taking a firm stand for right, honor, de
cency and the cause of Christianity against
her own pastor in the First Church scandal.
THE HAND OF FELLOWSHIP.
Exteuded to Dr. Ailhuin of the First
Congregational Church.
The new incumbent of the First Congre
gational Church, Rev. Dr. Adams, was ten
dered a highly flattering reception Thurs
day night by the representatives of almost
every religious denomination in San Fran
cisco. Di. H. L. Hallock of Mills College,
himself a Congregational divine, occupied
the chair, nnd the remaining seats upon
the platform were shared among the fol
lowing: Right Rev. Bishop Nichols, Dr. J.
Hemphiil of the Calvary Presbyterian
Church, Rev. W. W. Cnseo* Howard-street
Methodist Church. Rev. Dr. Stebbins of
the Unitarian body. Dr. Boynton of the
Baptists, Dr. W. D.Williams of the Ply
mouth Congregational Church, and finally
the gentleman in whose honor the pro
ceedings were held, Rev. Dr. Adams.
The chairman later took occasion to ex
press regret, on behalf of himself, his col
leagues and the congregation, that illness
should have prevented Dr. Voorsanzer
from voicing the sentiment o> the Jewish
community, as had been anticipated.
The commodious interior of the church
was well filled when, at S o'clock. Dr. J.
H. Warren introduced Dr. Hallock as the
chairman of the evening. He spoice a few
words of welcome.
Right Rev. Bishop Nichols then ad
dressed the congregation on behalf of the
Angli-an communion.
Dr. Hemphill extended a Presbyterian
welcome to the new pastor in a char
acteristically humorous address, and Rev.
Dr. Case spoke of the need of strong con
victions in a place like San Francisco, and
welcomed Dr. Adams as a man of that
caJibtr. Dr. Stebbins on behalf of Â»he
Unitarians responded in a thoughtful ana
philosophical speech to the invitation of
the chairman and invoked a blessing on
Dr. Adams' ministry.
Dr. Boynton, representing the Baptists,
described San Francisco as one of the
brightest missionary fields in the world,
and warmly welcomed Dr. Adams thereto,
and Dr. Williams of the Plymouth Con
gregational Ctiurcu spoKe for the Congre
gational community.
Dr. Adams briefly acknowledged the
good fellowship of his brother pastors.
The balance of the evening's programme
was composed of choral and >010 selec
tions by the choir. The speeches all con
cluded, the congregation adjourned to the
lecture-room of the church, where an
hour was passed in social intercourse.
Dr. Adams' installation will take place
next Tuesday.

HIS NEW LARIAT.
A Cowboy Makes Thing*
Hum and Hies Him
Hence.
BACK TO TEE PLAINS.
Four Months in San Francisco
Enough for Him â Why
It Was.
Crossing on the broai-cauge ferry the
other day was a decidedly good-looking
cowboy, attired as they love to be, and
carrying a bran new lariat. Of that he
s-etned to be particularly proud. He han
dled it and fondled it ; he toy . d with it and
played with it; after gazing at it as a
mother would at her new-born babe he hit
his leg very viciously with it. The cowboy
was evidently in love with hU lariat, and
himself, too. Cowboys like to talk to "you
fellows," as they somewi.at irreverently
call the newspaper men, and this cattle
Kins in embryo was no exception to the
rule.
"Going? Where am I going? Back
home, I reckon. Look like it, don't 1?"
he replied to a leading question.
"Had a good time in the City?" came
next. I
"Bit different to when I was down !vwr
or hve years ago," was the laconic anÂ»veÂ«.
"Whoopea it higher than ever beforejl
suppos?," ventured the inquirer.
"No; want to hear the story?"
. "Why, surely."
; "This is, I'll bet,"he began, "the first
time you run up against a jrame of this
sort. Yon see, when I came down in '91
I had a handsome roll â one of the largest
piles of greenbacks that left the prairies
that year, and I started in to do things up
in pretty lively shape. It took me about
six months to get about all I wanted, but
in that time I got a whole 'skinful.' I
starts off home one day, feeling as if I had
been run through several mills (home is the
prairie, it doesn't matter much where,
either) and after I found one or two of my
running mates, I started to herd ride again.
Bat just here is where thÂ« tale begins.
That six months down here in^Frisco was
too much for me I guess, for I tumbled to
it that I had about lost my j:rip. Why,
any ordinary pony could 'make a monkey'
out of me, anil as for my 'riata.' I had
mighty little use for it. 'Twasn't so bad
at first, but inside of a year I was as good
as laid off, and all because/I was 'fading
away,' as they say."
"What ob earth is 'fading' away?"
asked his interviewer.
"Don't you know? â why, you feel that
you are too tired to live; that you don't
want to see any bands of cattle; you sweat
nights, and cold at that, too, and then
your face gets like a corpse that's been
dead for a week of Sundays. You can't
see your cattle, to say nothing about rop- â 
ing 'em. In fact you are 'no good.' . You
fellowsâ some ot you must get that way.
Well, I give up, ana off to Denver to see a
doctor. No good. Back 'home.' No good.
Off again to Cheyenne. No good. Then I
was broke, and all the time getting worse.
About seven months ago tie boys got to
reading something about some place in
Frisco, and . they . all . chips in ; stakes me
good to try it as a final show not to have
to 'cash in,' and I came down.". Then he
drew a big sigh of relief, and added as a
sort of "postscript,' "and I'm feeling bully
too. you bet."
"What did you do down here that ,
brought about this great change in yc^^g
for you are surely strong and well enou,^^^
now?'' was asked. \ T
"Nothing at all. That is, I did go up
to wheie they said I was to go â to tÂ«e
Hudson Medical Institute, you know â
that great while building at the corner of
Stockton, Market and Ellis streetsâ and
when I told the doctors there just how I
was fixed I just let them run me. They
gave me what they all call the "Great Hud
yan" and told me how to take it and
when to take it, how to carry myself and
what to eat and drink and what time to
turn in. That's all I done. They looked
after the rest." â¢ = , , ;
"But how aid you come to hear of that
great institute?" he was asked.
"Oh, I heard of it everywhere; but, you
see, some of the boys got hold of some of
the testimonials that they sent out about
â¦his "Hudyan" and we wrote for more
and got 'em all free, and when we reads
what it does for others I try it. It cures
me too, don't it?'
It was evident that it had. And â be was
off back for "home" again. . '." ; : ..': > ; -

TO HAVANA CITY

Dr. Maximo Zertucha, an Insur
gent Who Surrendered, De
clares Maceo Is Dead.
Says He Saw the Daring Leader
Mortaly Wounded, but the Body
Is Not Found.
HAVANA, Ciba, Dec. 11.â General
Weyier arrived here at 5:30 o'clock this
afternoon. He rode into fhe city on
horseback, accompanied Dy two Fquad
rons of cavalry- His coming had been
made known to the public, and large
crowds gathered to welcome him. He
was given a popular ovation from the time
he reached the city limits until he arrived
at the palace. At some places along his
route cirls strewed flowers in his psthway,
and he was in other ways treated as a
popular hero.
CalJe Obispo, Calle O'Reilly and the
other streets in the vicinity of the palace
and the Plaza de Annas were jammed
with people, who enthusiastically c eered
the captain-general as he rode along.
When he arrived near the palace the en
thusiastic crowd surrounded him, despite
the military, and he was compelled to
str>p his horse in order not to ri(!e down
hu< admirers, who greeted him with all
manner of loyal cries. A passageway wns
finally opened and General Weyler pro
ceeded to the palace. Shortly after he had
entered the building he appeared upon a
baliony and was greeted with the most
tumultuous cheering. The scene was
remiiiscent of waen Martinez Campos
arriv*d in Havana years ago after pucify
ine tte island.
Whtn General Weyler called upon his
addiece to cheer for the King, for Spain
and fo: the army a roar went up that
could le heard across the bay in Morro
Castle iid the fortress of Cabanas.
Whei silence had been restored General
Weylemade an address, from the tenor
of whiCiit would be supposed that the
suppresion of the rebellion was an accom
plished ict. He said, among other things,
that eveything that had been done had
been acomplished by the army, whicli
had baei intrusted with the pacification
of the :land and the maintenance of
Spain's Â«vereignty.
He tts continually interrupted by
cheering,vhich was continued after he
had left te balcony.
Later Cneral Weyier gave a reception
that was itended by the members of the
municipalcorporation, delegations from
various soteties and prominent residents
of the city.
The city >night presents a most ani
mated aspe, reflecting the joy felt by the
Spaniards fcause of Maceo's deatli and
Hiener&l Weler's triumph over the iu
surpents in c western province.
C:isa Blan, the little village under the
walls ol theabanas Fortress, and Regla,
on the sottern side of the bay, held
litjle dematrations of their own in
honor of th victorious return of General
Weyler.

COLLIS AND THE REFUNDING BILL CAMPAIGN.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 11â C. P. Huntington will be here to-morrow to begin a personal conduct of his
refunding bill campaign. The head clerk at the Normandie Hotel said to the Call correspondent that the magnate
would arrive to-morrow. It is probable that the bill will not come up in either House until after the holidays, though it
is possible the Senate may consider it earlier. It will be brought up in the House on January 5, debate to continue four
days, the last day to be devoted to speeches under the "five-minute rule."
Hubbard, Kyle, Be!l, Harrison and Sulzer of the Pacific Roads Committee will oppose the Powers bill. Bell will
oppose Government ownership, but favors an extension bill, under certain conditions, mentioned in the following abstract
of his minority report, filed to-day:
"The undersigned does not desire to enter into a discussion of the merits of the proposition that the Government
should become the owner of the railroads, and so far as this report is concerned that suggestion will not meet with any
further consideration. If the Government property would bring the amount of the Government's dabt, as well as of that
which is secured by the prior lien, this would be a simple and by far the most satisfactory settlemsnt that could ba
effected; but it is generally thought that the properties would not bring anything like the amount necessary to pay off
botn the Government's debt and the debt secured by the prior lien. The question then recurs on the funding proposition.
The maladministration of the properties began with the building of the roads and has continued ever since they were com
pleted. The companies are in no condition to ask for favors.
"It is manifest in tnis Powers extension bill the Government will be extending to the Union Pacific a favor which has
never been equaled by any granted to a corporation before, in getting the use of the Government's money at 2 per
cent per annum, when they will be able to negotiate loans at 4 percent to the amount secured by the first mortgage.
If the company was compelled to borrow money in the money market it would have to pay 5 per cent. What is true of
the Union Pacific may be said of the Central Pacific, that is to say: If the Government takes a second mortgage to secure
its debt, it virtually becomes the guarantor of the debt stcured by the first mortgage.
"I therefore recommend that the bill reported by the committee be amended so as to provide that the debts due by the
roads should be extended at 3 instead oi 2 per cent interest per annum, and that this extension be granted only on condi
tion that the companies arrange to secure the Government debt by a first mortgage on the property upon which it is pro
posed in the bill reported by the committee that it shall have a second mortgage. I also recommend that a provision bo
Inserted in the bill requiring the law officers of the Government to institute proceedings looking to the foreclosure of its
lien and the sale of the property in the event that the terms of settlement which we recommend are not accepted within a
stated time by the respective companies."

zens, at which Senor Arango of Cleveland
will make an addre?s. The local society
will form branches in the cities of the
State, all persons being eligible to mem
bership who will contribute to the fund for
aid of the insurgents. Correspondence
has been opened with the New York junta,
which has approved the lowa organization,
and a letter from Senor Palma was read.
The officers elected by the Dcs Moines or
ganization are: W. D. Coonpy, president,
and E. D. Hamlin, secretary and
treasurer.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Doc. 11.âSemi
official advices from Madrid to-day state
that Government circles as well as the
conservative element generally are en
tirely satisfied with the feature of the
President's message which related to
Cuba. The first impression formed by the
meoger reports cabled to Spain was not
satisfactory and produced some irritation.
When the full text of the Cuban chapter
appeared in the leading papers of the
kingdom there was, it is reported, a com
plete revolution of sentiment, and the
President's courteous and considerate
treatment of the subject received general
approval. The President's utterances are
taKen, on tte whole, to indicate a better
understanding between the two countries,
lhese advi<es contain the further infor-
mation that as it Is the intention of the
Spanish Government when certain of the
provinces are pacified to give home rule to
Cuba on the lines indicated in the Presi
dent's message little fear of intervention
is now felt.

LONDON, E.vg., Dec. 11â The Daily I
News will to-morrow publish a dispatch j
irom Rom* stating that it is reported
there that Spain has asked the Pope to
ascertain through the Papal nuncios at
the various capitals whether any of the
Dowors would support her in the event of
war with the United States, or interfere
in Spain's behalf at the right moment.
The dispatch adds that Si^nor de Felice
Giuffrida, the well-known socialist mem
ber of the Chamber of Deputies, has made
an offer to the Central Cuban Committee
to take several hundred of his friends to
Cuba to join the insurgents.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Dec. 11.â An
afternoon paper to-day publishes a lone
story to the effect that a regiment of 1500
men to fight in Cuba was being raise t in
the citjes of Baltimore, New York, Bos
ton, Washington and Philadelphia, and
that another regiment hai already been
rased in the States of Virginia and Ten
nessee. Philadelphii 's quota toward the
regiment being raised in the Eastern
cities is given at 300 men, and about
eighty-five men have already been en
listed here. The men are to receive $25 a
month pay, and must be American citi
zens of good reputation. Captain Wil
liam R. Haniey is said to be enlisting the
Philadelphia battalion. Captain Haniey
is said to have served eighteen years in
the United States army and was dis
charged from the service in 1805.
Havana and Vicinity Where the Cuban Insurgents Are Raiding.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1896.
HUNTINGTON HAS
A ROCKY ROAD
Cannot Rush Through the
Refunding Scheme Just
at Present.
Bell of Texas Submits a Minority
Report of the Pacific Roads
Committee.
Increased Interest and a First Mortgage
or a Forec osure Ars the T^rms
Demanded.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 11.â Unless
the Pacific refunding bill now before the
House is amended to meet the objection
urged against it by the minority of the
Pacific Railroad Committee, the bill will
be opposed bitterly. The minority, in a
report submitted by Bell of Texas to-day,
recommends that the bill be amended so
as to provide that the debts due by the
roads be extended at 3 per cent instead of
2 per cent per annum, and that the exten
sion be granted only on condition that the
companies arrange to secure the Govern
ment's debt by a first mortgage on tne
property upon which it is proposed in the
bill it shall have a second mortgage.
It is also recommended that a provision
be inserted reauiring the law officers of
the Government to institute proceedings
looking to a foreclosure of its lien and the
sale of the property in the event that the
terms of settlement are not accepted by
the respective companies.
Among the objections stated to the bill
in its present form are applications pro
vide.! for of the funds in the sinking fund ;
the requir-ment that the $2,409,818 which
stands credited to the Central Pacific Com
pany for services on non-aided lines
should be applied to the payment of the
Central Pacific's debts to the Government,
to the default provision of the bill ami
the prohibition against the payment of
dividends upon the stock unless actually
earned and unless the companies shall
have raid all interest due on their bonded
debt and all matured installments of the
interest?.
In reaching these conclusions the mi
nority report recites the history of the
legislation authorizing the building of the
Pacific roads. Tne Union Pacific road
and the Kansas Pacific are treated as one,
and, the report states, have been consoli
dated and to them have been issued $33
-539.512 of the subsidy bonds.
It was when the bonds loaned these
companies were issued that one - half
of the compensation due by the Govern
ment for services rendered it by the com
panies, and that 5 per cent of the net earn
ings, which was to be applied to the pay
ment of the bonds and interest, would pay
the interest and leave something over for
the gradual extinction of the debt. This
has proved delusive, the companies hav
ing defaulted interest and suit having
been entered for same.
The Supreme Court has decided that the
amount paid by the Government was not
due until the bonds matured. There is
now held in the treasury, the report says,
available for the purpose of paying off the
mortgage debts of the Central Pacific
Company $6,493,127. and of the Union
Pacific Company, $15,325,985.
"It is proposed by the bill," the report
says, "to apply the amounts in the re
spective sinking funds to the extinguish
ment pro tanto of the Government's debt,
and to this suggestion there can be no ob
jection."
The report makes the indebtedness of
the Union Pacific to the Government,
after deducting the amount which would
be realized from the securities in the sink
ing fund, $53,716,418. and of the Central
Pacific $57,681,514. The report treats at
length of the sufficiency of the settlement
proposed by the Pacific railroads, and
finds that that property is appraised at
much more than its cash value, which is
stated by the railroads at $35,600,000 of un
subsidized property.
The report states that when the first
mortgage lien of $33,532,000 is considered,
if the roads are sold at auction they
will not bring sufficient to satisfy that
lien and the Government's debt.
The settlement proposed of extending
the Government loan for forty years at 2
per cent while the road is paying 4 per
cent on its first raor:gage loan would be
unjust to ttie Government.
If the Government extends the second
mortgage now it would in effect guaran
tee the payment of the first mortgage
bonds. What has been said of the Union
Pacific applies equally to the Central Pa
cific, which owes the Government $52,801,
-000, that is, if the Government extends
the second mortgage.
The report recognizes that "without any
fault of ours conditions prevail which ren
der it necessary for the Government to
either lose an enormous sum of money or
to adopt a refunding scheme, but before
we can agree to any refunding scheme it
ought to be clearly aepionstrated that the
Government would be placed in much bet
ter position than it now is. Believing the
Government's position would not be ma
terially improved if the terms of the pro
posed bill werr carried out we cannot as
sent to its provisions."

GARY'S FRIENDS
CALL AT CANTON
Maryland Anxious to Secure
a Representative in
the Cabinet.
Claims of the Southern Members
of the Farty May Have
Some Weight.
Major HcEinby Listens Patiently to
the Visitors, bat Dees Not
Make Any Premises.
CANTON, Ohio, Dec. ll.âFollowine the
example of the ' Michigan friends of Gen
eral Alger, representatives of Â» the friends
of Jamas A. Gary of Baltimore in the
â South to-day sent a large delegation to
Canton to formally ask the President
elect to consider, him as a Cabinet possi
bility. It was the second deleeatioi. to
call in the interests of a Cabinet possibility,
and the custom may now be regarded as
established. At the head of the delega
tion to-day was Senator-elect George L.
Wellington of Maryland. Â£
Major McKinley received his visitors
cordially and listened with marked atten
tion to what Senator Wellington, who
spoke for the whoie committee,, had to
say. Senator Wellington said that he and
his associates cam* not to urge the ap
pointment of Mr. Gary, but to ask the
President-elect to consider him as a pos
sible Cabinet officer, in case he decided to
choose one of his advisors from the South.
Mr. Gary, he stated, is a . successful busi
ness man of high character and an ardent
Republican with a great record for useful
ness. ,â  -\'\ Â;;â >â  ','/. r â¢'â .â â¢â¢.'â  'y'^ri
"The South is behind Mr. Gary," con
tinned Senator Wellington. l% His State is
solid for him, and we think Maryland
worthy of recognition if any State in the
South is. A majority of the Southern
States bave representatives here to-day to
say that Mr. Gary's appointment would
be highly acceptable to them. He is the
one Southern man who practically has
the Republicans of the whole South be
hind him."
Major McKinley said nothing that could
be considered a promise.
The feeling is that if a Southern man is
appointed to the Cabinet be is lueiy to
corao from Maryland or West Virginia,
though H. Clay Evans of Tennessee is n
good deal talked of, and there is frequent
mention of J. F. Hanson ( of Georgia.
Nathan Goff of West Virginia is thought
by many to be a strong possibility.
Major McKinley had a great many call
ers to.ciay, but he found time to get out
for a drive and a stroll in the bright sun
shine. Among those who called were:
William Whitman of Boston, who had a
conference lasting an hour and a half;
Congressman James McLachlin of Cali
fornia, Thomas More of Philadelphia and
William D. Windom of Washington,
D. C, son of ex-Secretary of the Treasury
William Windom.
The people of Canton are to have an
opportunity of saying good-by to Major
McKinley just before he leaves this city
for Washington.
Representatives of the Canton Business
Men's Association called on the major to
consult with him as to having him the
guest of honor at the annual banquet of
the association, which is usually held on
or near the first Tuesday of January.
After considering the matter, and con
versing on kindred topics, it was thought
advisable to give all the people, without
regard to business or political connections,
an opportunity to extend farewell words
to President-elect McKinley before he eoes
to the National capital to be inaugurated.
The reception is to be under the direction
of ihe Canton Business Men's Association,
and will occur shortly before Major Mc-
Kinley leaves for Washington. The place
of ho'ding the reception is also undecided,
but a hotel will probably be chosen; peo
ple in general are to be given a cordial in
vitation to take just such a part as they
desired.

LIVERPOOL, England, Dec. 11â The

EYES MEET BUT
NO WORDS PASS
Sister Martha, Once Mattie
Overman, Encounters
Rev. Brown.
While Speaking to Christian
Workers She Beholds ths
Man She Lied to Save.
But After One Glance at the Reformed
Woman the Saame-Faced Ex-
Pastor Sneaks Away-
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 11.â An evening
paper printed the following to-day:
"The Lord saves. He has saved me â of
all sinners the lowest." 4
Uttered with devout fervor, these words
rang from the lips of a young woman at a
Salvation Army meeting in Willurd Hall
last Tuesday noon. The face of her who
thus cried aloud was beautiful, was evi
dently that of a person of culture and re
finement, but there wus a sadness in its
expression that was in pitiful harmony
with the pathos of her words. As she
spoke her eyes wandered over the little
sea of heads bowing in prayer.
At the sound of her voice one of the
heads turned involuntarily toward her.
A man with a pallid face started as
though about to rise. The eyes of the
two met for a moment and there was a
flash of mutual recognition. Then the
man recovered control of himself. He re
sumed his seat, and through the re
mainder of the services sat with bowed
head and shame-faced mien. Few in the
audience saw ih*e scene, but in the brief
glance the years of two eventful lives
were rehearsed.
Those two â the pleading woman aDd the
shame-faced manâ were the principals in
the notorious Overman-Brown church
trial in San Francisco, the sensational
charges which attracted so much attention
at the time. The Rev. C. O. Brown was
the pastor of a church in San Francisco.
Miss Mattie Overman was a member of
his household. The clergyman and his
wife frequently quarreled. Then a scan
dal began to be noised abroad. The pastor
got a letter from a member of his congre
gation, who claimed to be a confidant of
Miss Overman.. The writer asked for
$2000 and said if this were not forthcom
ing she would make charges against the
pastor to his church.
The Rev. Mr. Brown was unable to get
the $2000. but he scraped together $500 and
gave his note for the balance. Later he
learned from Miss Overman that be bad
been duped â that tbe writer of the letter
was no confidant of hers. Then the pastor
refused to honor his note and the charges
were brought before the church. In the
trial that resulted Miss Overman nobly
stood by the man in whose home she bad
been livine." She denied everything.
At the close of the trial Miss Overman
went to New Mexico. Here, hard pressed
and among* strangers, she wrote to Dr.
Brown, asking for a little assistance. In
return came an imp tide nt reply. Not
knowing what to do or where to go she
returned to San Francisco. Then she be
came penitent and corroborated the
charges made against the pastor.
Wandering into a mission one night by
chance she fell among the Critteuden
workers, and seeking forgiveness through
repentance was taken in and made one of
the Lttle army of workers for fallen
humanity. Henceforth she was known as
Sister Martha.
It was while on her way to Washington,
D. C, where she goes to assist Mrs. Emily
Waller Barrett in rescue work, that Sister
Martha happened into Wiilard Hall.
When the meeting was over she went out
and went straight to the Anchorage Mis
sion, there to address an audience of
young women.
The Rev. Dr. Brown when the meeting
was over went his own way, and tUat
brief Elance during the services was their
only meeting. What the clergyman is
doing in Chicago no one seem? to know.-
Shortly after the trial he left San Fran
cisco and drifted East, to be lost sight of
until his. dramatic meeting with the
woman whose name was once linked with
his own.
LOCKED UP TO STARVE.
With Her Little Daughter an Insane Woman
Holds the Fort for Days in a
Barricaded Room.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 11.â With a de
termination to starve Mrs. Ansena Anaer
son locked herself and eight-year-old
Freda in their single living-room at 342
West Chicago avenue last Tuesday and
both have existed there since without food
or drink. To-nicht the police called to
the scene by neighbors forced an entrance
into'the room and took mother and daugh
ter to the station. The former, it is be
lieved, is insane and the latter was nearly
starved. Freda said her mother locked
and barricaded the door Tuesday morning
and threatened her against any outcry.
They had neither food nor fuel. Freda
begged to be released when she became
hungry, but the mother would not allow
her to go.
This evening while Mrs. Anderson was
sleeping the child went to the window and
attracted the attention of a neighbor. No
body has been seen about the house since
Tuesday, and it was supposed they had
moved. When the child had succeeded in
notifying the neignbors several of them
attempted to gain admission to the room.
Unable to do this they notified the police
and officers forced open the door. Mrs.
Anderson resisted, but was taken to the
station. Seven years ago she wns de
serted by her husband. She will be ex
amined by the county physicians as to her
sanity. The child, aithough weak, is said
not to be in a dangerous condition.
THIS WORRIES STATE OFFICIALS.
Nebraska's Attorney- General Says That
Bonds Furnished by Surety Com
panies Are Not Valid.
LINCOLN, Neer., Dec 11. â An opinion
rendered at the request of Governor
Holcomb by Attorney-General Churchill
has caused surprise; almost consternation,
among incoming State officials to-day!
It is in effect that the law passed by the
last Legislature, allowing State, county
or city officers to give bonds furnished
by guarantee companies is unconstitu
tional. This conclusion of the Attorney-
General may have an important bearing
on the action of incoming State officers.
It has been reliably reported that State
Treasurer-elect Meserve proposes to be
prepared for any emergency by present
ing to tbe Governor and other officials
whpse duty it is to pass on his bond, two
bonds, one executed by guarantee com
panies and another signed by citizens of
the State. It has been claimed by sup
porters of the incoming administration
that the State would have no right to pay
the fee demanded by guarantee companies
in such a case and that the Treasurer him
self cannot afford to pay the fee, because
it would amount to more than bia. salary.
The contention of the Attorney-General
is that there must be a personal surety
without cost to the State, though admit
ting that there are elements of doubt in
the question. The validity of bonds now
in force furnished by these companies is
not brought into question though they
may be later.

CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 11.â Florence V.
Graves has -finally secured her divorce

CIVIL SERVICE
REFORM LEAGUE
Interesting Addresses and
Reports at the Business
Session.
Grover Cleveland Applauded for
His Efforts in Strengthen
ing the System.
President-Elect McKinley Asked to
Select Officials Solely Upon
Merit.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Dec. 11.â The
delegates to the annual meeting of the
National Civil Service Reform League,
which began yesterday in the Hotel Wal
ton, held a business session this morning.
President Schurz was in bad voice, and
Henry Hitchcock of St. Louis presided.
These officers were elected: President,
Carl Schurz of New York ; vice-presidents-
Charles Francis Adams of Boston, Au
gustus R. McDonough of New York, Right
Rev. Henry C. Potter of New York, J. Hall
Pleasant of Baltimore, Henry Hitchcock
of St. Louis, Henry C. Lease of Phila
delphia, Franklin MacVeagh of Chicago,
William Potts of New York and Arch
bishop Ryan of Philadelphia.
Secretary Acanery read the report of the
committee on civil service extension, by
Colonel John R. Proctor, president of the
Civil Service Commission, which explained
the operations of the civil service among
Government employes. Addresses on civil
service were made by C. P. Willis of Cin
cinnati, W. F. Cushing of Cleveland, Rev.
W. R. Lord of St. Paul, Henry Hitchcock
of St. Louis, Richard Henry Simon of
Boston and J. G. Thorp of Madison, Wis.
Charles J. Bonaparte of Boston, chaii
man of the committee on resolutions, pre
sented the report of that body, which was
adopted after some changes. They refer
to the fact that for the first time since the
organization of the league its principles
were openly repudiated and a revival of
discarded abuses threatened in the plat
form put forth by a National convention
and in the public declarations of a candi
date for the Presidency, and "congratu
lates the country that the purpose thus
foreshadowed to undo tbe good accom
plished by persistent effort during a gen
eration's space has failed of consumma
tion."
The league congratulates the country on
the "truly remarkable" progress of the
reform under the second administration
of President Cleveland and especially
during the past year, and declares that
"for this great achievement, advancing as
it does tbe fundamental principles of free
government, President Cleveland deserves
the sincere and heartfelt thanks of all
good citizens."
The league recognizes in the President
elect a friend 10 civil service reform and
urges that lie adopt as soon as practicable
a plan which may enable him to base his
nominations for non-political Presidential
offices, such as postmasters and consuls,
npon ascertained fitness and efficiency,
regardless of party or other affiliations.
The league lurther suggests to the Presi
dent-elect that tlie public interest would
be advanced if no removals were made of
fourth-ciass postmasters except for cause,
and it submits the advisability of extend
ing the system of registration of laborers
to all departments. This concluded the
work of the business session.
This afternoon these papers were read :
"The Relation of Women to the Civil
service Reform Movement,' 1 by Mrs.
Charles Russell Lowell; "Civil-service
Reform in the West," Colonel J. W. Ela,
Chicago; "Four Years' Tenure," Lucius
B. Swift, Indianapolis; "Civil-service Re
form In the Constitution of New York
State," Hon. 8. A. Rogers, Buffalo; "Civil
Service Commission Essential to Civii
service Reform," Hon. DormanÃ. Kaston,
New York.
After tne reading of the papers^ the
meeting adjourned sine die. It is proba
ble that the next annual meeting will be
held at Cincinnati. The place will be se
lected by the executive committee.
A banquet was given the visiting dele
gates to-night by the Pennsylvania Asso
ciation. Herbert W 7 eleh, the president of
the Pennsylvania Association, presided,
and a number of addresses were made by
prominent persons.
CREEDON DEFEATS O'BRIEN.
But He Did Not Have Wind Enough to
Knock Out the P ucky Boston
Slogger.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 14. - Dan
Creedon of Australia defeated Dick
O'Brien of Boston in the ninth round of
their battle at the Broadway Athletic Club
to-night. O'Brien showed himself a
wonderfully game man and a terror to
take punishment.
Though Creedon was tired at the finish
he showed himself the better man in
every way. About 2000 people were pres
ent when the opening bout, in which liilly
Whistler of Philadelphia and Eddy Curry,
a local boxer, were the principals. They
went the stipulated ten rounds at 120
pounds and were pretty evenly matched,
but Referee Roche gave the decision to
Curry. The verdict was roundly hissed
and booted. It should have been a draw.
The big fellows were not long in getting
into the ring. Creedon was seconded by
Seth Smith, Jem Mace, ex-heavy-weight
champion, and Benny Murphy. O'Brien's
seconds were Danny McÃride, Tim Me-
Grath, Scotty Faulkner and Jack Burns.
Dick Roche was referee, and Fred Fleck
kept the clock.
The betting was abont 9 to 5 in favor of
Creedon. Both got into the ring at 9:35.
They fought at catch weights, Creedon
scaling 101 pounds. O'Brien at first re
fused to give nis weight, but later con
fessed to 151 pounds, though he looked at
least nine pounds heavier.
Round Iâ After a moment's sparring Cree
don shoved a straight left into Dick's face
He repeated a moment later, O'Brien counter
ing on the body. O'Brien led twice but was
blocked. Then lie tapped Dau lightly on tbe
face. They exchanged lefts and Creedon
pushed bis glove into O'Brien's face and the
latter slipped down. He got up and sent the
right to the jaw, Creedon countering on the
body.
. Round 2â O'Brien led, but wu stopped. Dan
sent a left to the wind and another In the face.
O'Brien sent a hard right on the wind and a
leu on the jaw later, but was well countered
each time. Creedon put a left on the nose
nnd then sent a right to the jaw, staggering
Dick. Creedon forced the lighting. Just as
the bell rung Dick put a hot swing on the
wind, but Dan only smiled.
Round 3 was a mixup and Creedon was the
best man. There was very lively fighting in
the next two rounds, and at the end of round
six O'Brien sent a right to tne j*w that nearly
knocked Creedon down and both were bleed
ing and almost groggy when the bell rang.
Round 7â O'Brien's left found the nose and
Dan sent a hard one on the wind. Creedon
started in again with left jabs on the face.
Tne Australian followed up and put a hard
left three timei on the jaw. O'Brien. sent a
warm left on DfÂ»n's lnw. 'Both were very
tired when the round ended.
Round 8 was a vigorous one. Both men
were game.
Round 9â Creedon sent his left to the jaw.
O'Brien mixed it up, but Crecdon quickly
ruined in a shower of rights and lefts that
made the Boston boy grogey. But ne wns
game to the core and Creedon lacned suffi
cient strength to put him out. He kept plug
gins Dick all over the ring, and O' Brian was
all but out when the referee stopped the bout
on two minutes and flfty-ei?ht seconds Of the
round and declared Dreedou the winner.
ATHLETICS AT STANFORD.
Picher Wins the Tennis Singles Cham
pionship â Football Men Denied
a Coach.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oal., Dec.
11. â Tbe championship game in singles
was played on tbe tennis court this after
noon by Oliver 8. Picher '93 of Pasadena
and Charles P. Kaetael :96: 96 of Cambria.
The former won handily, the sets result
ing 6â3, 6âl, 6â4. The games were
hotly contested, although Picher man
aged to win the deciding point. Kaetzel
used an underhand drive effectually. His
placing and serving were not up to his
usual form. Picher played a strong
game throughout. His accurate placing
and his drives. decided many points in his
favor. But a small crowd witnessed the
game, as it was not generally known that
the university championship was to be
decided this afternoon.
Louis Freeman '99, last year's cham
pion, was scheduled to play the winner of
the recent preliminary tennis tourna
ment, which was won by Kaetzel '96. He
did not care to defend the title this year.
A game to decide the Stanford cham
pions in doubles will be played on tbe
tennis courts to-morrow forenoon. Free
mar. '99 and Picher '98, last year's cham
pions, will meet D. Arnold '95, and Kaet
zel '9(5, winners of the preliminary tourna
ment. An interesting came is antici
pated.
The football men will decide on Wednes
day who is to be the next captain.
Charles Fickert '98 has been repeatedly
urged by his friends to lead the team
another year, but has definitely decided
not to change his original determination â
to not be a candidate. Stuart Cotton '98,
who played such a remarkable game in
the intercollegiate contest, is a prominent
candidate for the honor. The friends of
N. A. Carle '98 are advancing his interests.
The executive committee of the Asso
ciated Students met last evening to con
sider the request of the baseball men, that
they be allowed a coach for tbe coming
season. They maintained that the pro
fessional player, Lange, might be engaged,
and as he did a great deal toward getting
tbe nine into shape last year it would be
pood policy to secure his services this year.
Tbe committee, after carefully consider
ing the matter, determined that tbe
finances were not in such shape at present
as would admit of hiring a coach, and re
fused to accede to the demands of the
ball-players. This action is not final,
however, as the committee has the power
and may see fit later to engage a coach.
CORBEIT READY TO FIGHT.

Minute*.
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec 11.â James J.
Corbett was asked to-day if he had seen
Dan Stuart, who, a short time age, offered
a $15,000 purse for a finish fight between
the ex-champion and Fitzsimmons.
"I have not heard Jrom Dan Stuart as
yet," said he, "but I suppose he will see
me before twenty-four hours have passed."
"What do you think of Stuart's offer of

simmons and you?"
"Well, you see," replied Corbett, "we
have received an offer of a $15,000 pur3e to
box fifteen rounds in San Francisco and I
have accepted it. I don't see why Fitz
simmons don't."
Corbett further stated that if Fitzsira
mons would accept the offer he would
agree to stop him in fifteen minutes or
else turn over the entire Durse to him. If
Fitzsimmons would not fight for a ,'imited
number of rounds Corbett said he would
tight him to a finish.
HALE REAKS ALL RECORDN.
Great Time Made U<j the Irish Hero in
the Wheel Hare.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 11.-One
minute after 8 o'clock to-night Teddy
Hale, the Irish hero of the six-day bicycle
race at Madison-square Garden, passed tbe
previous record for six days made by
Schock in 1893â1600 milesâ by four laps
and 25 hours 59 minutes to the good. He
aot only broke the records himself, but
forced tbe six men following on his tracks
to break the previous best record for 116
hoursâ l4s7 miles eieht laps. Hale wus
sprinting miles in 2:24 at 7 o'clock this
evening, and appeared so fresh and well
that he is looked upon as the winner of
the contest. The battle for second honor
was waged again to-day between Foster
and Rice. At noon the Hollander had a
bit the best of his opponent and led by a
few miles, but later on Rice regained the
lead.
Reading, Schock. Smiib, Taylor. Moore
and Pierce kept in about the relative posi
tions after the leaders all day. Ashiugor,
Maddox and Cassidy of the third division
were about forty miles behiud Pierce,
while of the other four Gannon and Mc-
Leod are likely to get the tail end of the
eleven prizes if they keep on at the same
rate.
A tremendous burst of applause greeted
Hale when the announcement was made
at 8 o'clock that he had broken the six-day
record.

VIGO. Spain, Dec. 11.â Some bodies from
tbe ill-fated Salier have been washed

LONDON, Eng.. Dec. 11.â The Daily
Mail wlil to-morrow publish a dispatch
from Corunna saying that there were 184
men and 95 women on the steamer Salier.
Only 51 of this number embarked at
Corunna. The dispatcn adds that the
completeness of the disaster precludes the
obtaining of any details.
BREMEN, Germany, Dec. 11.â The loss
of life by the foundering of the North
German Lloyd sleamer Salier, which sank
on Corunna's shoals in a gale that swept
the Atlantic early this week, is now posi
tively known. The steamer, in addition
to a crew of 78 men, carried 214 steerage
passengers.
Every soul went down, making a total
of 292 persons that perished through the
foundering of the steamer. The steerage
passengers were bound for Argentina,
where they intended to settle. The Salier
carried no cabin passengers. Lloyds'
agents at Corunna report that the Saiier
foundered in a dense fog. The Salier, the
agent says, had a fearfully rough passage
from Bremen to Corunna.
BREMEN, Germany, Dec. 11.â A dis
patch from Corunna 10 tbe Cologne
Gazette says that the number of persons
loit by the foundering of the steamer
Salier may possibly reach as high as 500.

FEARFUL DISASTER AT XERES.
Scores of People Buried in the Ruins of
Two Bui/dings That Suddenly
Collapsed.
CADIZ, Spain, Dec. 11.â A terrible dis
aster occurred at Xeres, sixteen miles
from this city, this morning through the
collapse of a building. A house contain
ing twenty-five persons fell without warn
ing, burying all the inmates in the debris.
The bouse fell upon an adjoining tene
ment building, which also gave way. The
tenement-house was inhabited by eighty
five persons and all were buried by the
wreckage. Eleven dead bodies and forty
six seriously injured have been taken from
the ruins.
The scene about the ruins was a pitiful
one. The news spread rapidly, and it was
not long before an immense crowd had
gathered there. Friends and relatives of
the buried people made loud outcries. As
each body was brought out people would
crowd around it to try and recognize the
battered features. Volunteers were plenty
to aid in the work of excavation. Men,
women and children worked like fiends in
a mad effort to save life.
The blame for the accident has not been
placed. A searching investigation, how
ever, is promised.

Governor Sacg.ces Orders the Out

SAN DIEGO, Cal.. Dae 11. â Four
Mexican rurales started out from the IR
. tie border hamlet of Tecate last Tuesday
â¢witb.^ their short carbines, their sabers
.. clinking and their pistols handy. A tip
.had been received by Jose Riley, a Mexi
can of Hibernian name, who orliciaies in
the dual capacity oi Justice of the Peace
and head rurale at Tecate, to the effect
that Francisco Carmelo, the noted border
bandit, had been seen across the border
with two or three confederates and was
-bout to make a raid on the Ciballa.las of
(Mexican ranchers between Campo and the
i'meries. Judge Riley gathered his trusty
horsemen, who had served him as depu
ties before in heated arguments with
borderers, and took the trail for Canyada
Verde, where he believed Carmelo and
.Mseang would be found.
The place is about six miles south of the
boundary line. The posse arrived there
about noon, and moving with great
cannon, had the good fortune to come
upon Carmelo and two other desper
adoesâJose Valenzuchi and Tranqualino
Sosaâ 'while they were in the act of killing
a cow belonging to Bernardo Arguilez, a j
:ieigh baring rancher.
Riley talied upon Carmelo to surrender
and thrnst the muzzle of his carbine to
ward the outlaw's face. The rurales bad
ridden forward rapidly and surrounded
the gang, covering them with rifles. Two
of the bandits gave up at once, begging
tiie rurales net to shoot. Carmelo triel to
draw a revolver, but Ril?y c lecked him
and warned him to desist, and he surren
dered.
The ruriles tied the three thieves to
cether an ; hitched them all behind a
stout lariat to the saddle of tha horses,
and took up tne march back to the city,
which was reached without accident.
That night whiles the rurales were
asleep Carnielo managed to free himself,
awd speedily cuttinj; the bands of Valen
zueia- and Sosa they luade a dash for lib
erty. X.ley, lowever, awoke on the in
stant, and firol. The other ruraies leaped
up and searchfd for their guns. Carmelo
bad secured too carbines, and was using
or.easaclub ibile Valr-nzuela used the
other. The ottlaws made for the door,
but it was L/a.red. Carmelo and Valen- I
zuela stood witl their backs to Sosa while
Le tried 10 open the door. The room was
small, and the Â»ur rurales were on the
outlaws be/ore *hey coaJd escape. Car
bines, Knives ani revolvers were used as
well as possible n the small space, while
;he six men tumtled over each other in
r the darkness, fighting like demons.
f Riley had thu tdvantage, knowing the
room, and laid oit Sosa with a blow on
the "sku'.l. Carntlo, who is agile as a
cat, slipped in ant out among tbe fighting
men, givinsj a tab here and c blow
there, but notdoiig much damage beyond
giving Valenzuel; a bad cut in the back
oy mistake.
Riley and his men conquered and again
tieti the gansr. Yesterday mornin? they
started for Enseiada, 100 miles distant,
on horseback, twÂ« leading the prisoners,
lied and on foot, he others bringing up
tltie rear, with ca bines ready for instant
u^e. They traviled swiftly, and Sosa,
w ho is barely 18 .-ears of age, gave oui
. tuud they half-dngged him for twenty
rr-ilos. His legs a c badly swollen and it
m thought he will not recover from the
cruelly of the trip.
As soon as liley had turned his
prisoners over to tie jailer he reported to
Governor Sangines that he had captured
Cj rmeio. the cattlÂ«-thief.
"Ah, so?" repliel the Governor. "Send
foi tue corpora)," he directed. To that
officer he .'aid: 'Go and cut Carmelo's
hair off and put htn in a soldier's uni
form anri keep lim there ten years. I
have heard of Canielo. He is my malo.
He needs no trial to prove him a des
perado. Go, cut hd hair off!"
To-day Carmelo and Vaienzuela took
thaar places as partof tho Mexican army,
wearing linen unibrms and joining the
wood squad. Carmuo will learn to manip
ulate a bugle. Saa is in a critical condi
tiuii, and after his recovery will probably
be released, as the indications are tbat he
was unaware of Caimelo : s character when
he fell in with himat Canyada Verde.
BRITISH CLAMS EXORBITANT.
Testimony for the United States Intro
duced Before the Bering Sea
Co/mission.
VICTORIA, B. :., Dec. 11. -The cvi-
dence for the Unitd States in the case of
the British claim for the seiture of the
schooner Carolena Tas opened before the
Bering; Sea Commission to-day. Mr.
.Dickenson stated eiore calling the first
witness that whei Munsie was being
examined tue r.ami of John Cotsford had
been mentioned as one of the huntera on
the Carolena. Tba United States had
secured this witnes and the British side
â might call him if it pleased. Peters ex
plained that the British counsel had not
the opportunity of inding out what Cots
.ford's evidence would be and it would be
"better ior the Unital States to use him as
its witness.
\ John Cotsford tfa:ed that though now a
-resident of Eeattll he Lad been a hunter
on the Carolenajin 1886. He had been
engaged by Mun:ie, Becntei being present
when the arrang^nents were made. Becb
tel went, ud as |ir as Clayoquot on the
Carolena when it started for Bering Sea.
iiechtel did the bjying of canoes.
The Caiolena Jegan sealine in Bering:
Eea about July 1, md the witness under
stood than CaptaiS Ogilvie had intended
to leave about Aujfcst 2& After the ves
bel was seized and taken to Ounalaska its
crew was ullowed t\go ashore, half of the
number at a time, tut afterward the sea
men were allowed to ?o ashore as they
pleaÂ«ed. He put tfce number of seals
raucht in BerinK Seiiby the Carolena at
BGOorB4O.
Iv the cross-examiiaticn by Peters tbe
witness did noL kneten what provisions
I were 011 the Caroleni and had not seen
\ Bechtel pay money f^r tbe canoes to the
\ Indians at Clayoquot. â 
'. A. J. Bechtei was ne\t called and asked
â¢about nis ownership ofi the schooner San
Diego for the purpose q proving the regis
ter made Doth at Sal Francisco ana in
Victoria that Bechtei wia a United States
citizen in 1886.
Peters objected, declalng that the docu
ments were secondary pjoof. Aiter some
argument the docunienjs wÂ«re received,
subject to objections at the final argu
ment.
Captain Alexander McLean, who had
been connected with the sealing industry
since 1883. had been in the Bering Sea on
the Favorite in 1880 and 1887, and was
esptain of the Mary Ellen, was called.
HiÂ» opinion was that about August 20 was
the usual close of the sealing season in
Bering Sea. This witness said he knew
(something of the value of sealing vessels
in 1886, and he cave $1700 as what he
would have put on the Carolena in 1885,
after it had been repaired and lengthened.
In 1886 most of the sealing vessels that
came to Victoria were from San Francisco,
and could be built there new for $100 a ton.

OREGON'S LOSING RAILWAYS.
State Commission States That Not a
Line Has Paid Dividends Within
Four Years.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 11.â By the
report of the Oregon Railway Commission
just forwarded to the Governor a dis
couraging state of financial affairs is
shown. Not a road in the State has paid
dividends for four years or more. Both
the Oregon Railway and JSavijration and
the Southern Pacific show deficits. The
latter road (Oregon and California, oper
ated by the Southern Pacific under athirty
four year lease), has a shortage of $706,028
t his year, it was $607,975 short last year.
The earnings for 18!*> from all sources
amounted to $1,564,322 and the operating
expenses $1,326,382, leaving $237,930 to
apply on interest and tax account, whicn
amounted to $1,003,958, making a deficit
Of $76(5,028.
The Oregon Railway and Navigation
had a shortage, including rents and taxes,
of $2,333,395 in 1894. The showing since is
little over 4 per cent on the investment.
In 1596 the gross earnings werÂ» $2,640,112
and operating expenses $1,621,713; income
from operation $1.0x8,399.
The Oregon Central and Eastern is in a
bad way. Since the litigation in the
caurts when $15,000,0^0 of capital invested
iv it was wiped out and the road stood
absolutely valueless, there has been ex
pended $100,000 for improvements and still
there is not a cent in sight for the pur
chasers ev-n on their first investment.
Bonner & Hammond, the Montana mag
nates, really used their mines to keep up
expenses. The road must be extended
before it can pay. Notwithstanding tbese
difficulties the commission says it has
effected a reduction of freight rates.
LEASING BAy JOAGEIN TRACTS.
California Navigation Company Will
â Construct .yew Landing*!
STOCKTON. Cal., Dec. 11.â J. D; Peters,
president of the California Navigation and
Improvement Company, 1 has procured a
lease of all the land, along one of the
banks of the San Joaquin River from
Wakefietd to the Black 'Slough.*. The term
of the lease is forty-three years. It is
understood here that this has been done
partly in the interests of the steamboat
company â¢ and that within the next few
months at least rive new landings will be
constructed for the company's boats to
touch at.
Tbe land along the river between these
two points is very rich and fertile and
large crops of fruit and vegetables are
raised. Potatoes especially are raised in
immensa quantities, and it is probable
that it is the business of transporting
these produc:s of the soil the Navigation
Company is after.
Everything points to a readjustment of
tbe business ot the Navigation Company.
As has been announced at various times,
tbe corporation intends to put a line of
steamers on the river especially for pas
senger service in connection with the
Valley road, and this will leave the pres
ent steamers lor use in carrying freight
alone. If the proposed policy is pursued
it will lead to the reclaiming of thousands
of acres of land iv the county.

CLAIMS KINSHIP
TO BRITISH PEERS
Pendelton Forger Says Sir
Henry Elliott Is His
Brother.
Declares He Once Held O.'fice
in Australia and Was
Wealthy.
Lost His Properly, Came to America
ani Married a Half-Breed '
Equiw.
PENDLETON, Ob., Dec. 11.â J. F.
Elliott was placed in jail here on Wednes
day on a charge of forcing a $30 check on
the Pendleton Savings Bank. Elliott was
then suffering from delirium tremens.
When seen at the jail yesterdny he was
quiet and rational. He sad that he
could not deny having forged the check,
although he had no remembrance of it.
His brother, he said, was Governor of
Timbulana, one of the British possessions
in Alrica, and the one where were located
the enormously rich gold mines recently
developed. The same brother was a peer
of the British realm, Sir Henry George
Klliott, and he was in former years Em
bassador from the Court of St. James to
Madrid, Berlin and Vienna, and was Em
bassador to Constantinople when the
Turko-Rusbian war broke out. Elliott's
brother-in-law, he declared, was now
Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba. His
uncle, Sir Gilbert Elliott, was many years
ago the Speaker of the House of Commons.
The forger when a your.g man went to
Australia and was appointed a gold com
missioner. It was an office which afforded
an opportunity for getting hold of valu
able mining properties, and in a few years
he was possessed of a large fortune, which
amounted to about $80,000. Elliott sold
his mining interests and entered the
wholesale wine and grocery business in
Sidney and was prosperous. He entered
tbe political arena and was a candidate
for a parliamentary seat, and was engaged
in an active canvass when he became in
volved In domestic troubles which wrecked
his life and threw him out onto the worid.
Seafaring was his next experience and
he drifted to the Pacific coast of the
United States and landed in San Fiun
cisco. He owned a vessel and part of the
lime was first mate on a ship belonging
to the m*n now in the United States Sen
ate from Californiaâ George C. Perkins.
Elliott whs sent to Northern California
to pass an opinion on some of Senator
Pertins' tin mines which had been pros
pected. Elliott pronounced them of
small value ana came over into Oregon,
and was prospecting in Douglas County.
There he was kindly treated by a half
breed woman and cured of a very serious
sicuness. He married her and they
moved to the Umaliiia Indian Reserva
tion, wh^re they have lived for several
years. Mrs. Elliott claims she is entitled
to an allotment, though she has not yet
been given one.
NOT A LOS ANGELES OFFICER.
Pastor McLean's Constabulary Appoint
ment Reconsidered by the
Sheriff.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 11 âThe
constabulary authority with, which Pastor
McLsan was clothed by Sheriff Burr has
proved of iittle value and of brief dura
tion. The Sheriff, after looking into the
case and hearing of the parson's language
respecting his own indomitable courage
and bravery, decided to revoke the ap
pointment and ask Rev. Mr. McLean to
unload bis artillery. Referring to the ap
pointment and the crusade of the Park
burst Society, Sheriff Burr said:
"When I swore in Mr. McLean he in
formed mo that hit life was in danger,
and I did what I would for any reputable
citizen. I was informed Â«t the time that
his appointment was for self-protection
only, and tbat he could use it for no other
purpose. As soon as I discovered tbat it
was more to spite Chief of Police Glass
than for his own protection I made up my
mind to cancel the appointment, as I wish
to be in harmony with the Chief in all
matters pertaining to the enforcement of
the laws.
"I have had a large number of promi
nent citizens call upon me since Dr. Mc-
Lean's appointment was made public, who
protested in a vigorous manner. I con
sider the methods of the Parkhurst So
ciety, so far as they have gone, to be very
injurious to the rising generation. It ad
vertises questionable places and has a ten
dency to attract tbe attention of young
men and women to them."
The Parkhnrst Society's cases against
Jennie Meaue, Clara Loraine. Ethel Wil
?on, Ella Sullivan, Pearl Morton and Rosa
Mitchell were dismissed to-day on motion
of the attorneys lor tbe prosecution.
These women were charged with being re
taiiers of liquors without licenses. All of
the liquor cases will be prosecuted. The
courtroom was filled with a large crowd
to-day when the first was called.
After to-day's setbacks in the courts
Pastor McLean was asked if the society he
represented would abandon its crusade.
He said:
'â¢Most assuredly not. We shall prose
cute this work to thÂ« bitter end. Our
committee was not sufficiently advised in
the matter and made several mistakes â
of the mind, not of the heart."
Captain Teals a Deserter.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Dec. 11.â Now
that City Auditor Fred H. Teale has de
camped, details ot some of bis worst
breaches of propriety are coming to the
surface. Teale was captain of Company
C, N. G. C, and as such officer it is a
question in guard circles whether his
leave-taking will not result in his being
court-martialed and dismissed upon a
charge of desertion. It is said that con
fiding friends are out $1(500 realized by
Captain Teale on the last few days of his
residence here. His father, a respected
resident of Boyle Heights, will make the
amounts good.

AFFRAY AT MODESTO.
Two Men Engage m a Quarrel and One
Is Dying From a Bullet
Wound.
MODESTO, Cal., Dec. 11.â A shooting
affray here this afternoon resulted in tbe
wounding of J. H. Younsr, who is now
lying at the point of death. Young and
William Prltcbard met in the Brooklyn
chophouse and quarreled, though the cause
is not known. Young immediately pro
cured a revolver and meeting Pritchard in
a saloon later he demanded an apology,
which was refused.
Yfoung drew his revolver ar.d began
shooting. Pritchard also had a weapon
and shot. The men were but six feet
apart. Young emptied his pistol, shooting
five times. Pritchard shot twice, hitting
Young Doth times, but escaped injury
himself. One bullet entered Young's
shoulder. The other entered the pit of
the stomach, passing downward and lodg
ing in the right side of the back.
George Whallon, tbe owner of the sa
loon, then took a hand, knocking Young
down with a billiard cue, inflicting a scalp
wound. Constable Kiernan placed the
combaiant3 under arreat, and they were
conveyed to thÂ» county jail, where Exam
ining Physician Evans pronounced
Young's wound probably fatal.
Young is the third of three brothers
who have been in serious cutting and
shooting scrapes in the past two years.
All three are large men. Shruder Young
was nearly killed some time ago by a man
named Moye. In August last William at
tacked a man named Mills and was shot.
This latter scrape is believed to have been
the cause of to-day's trouble. It is said
that J. H. Young, while hunting for
Mills, mistook Pritchard for Mills and bo
gan a quarrel. He was intoxicated at the
time ot the trouble.
OPIUM SHIPPED FROM PORTLAND.
Consignors cf Crackers (0 Honolulu Puz
zled Over a Strange Find in
Their Freight. \
PORTLAND. Or.. Dec. 11.-The Port
land Cracker Company is greatly puzzled
to know how a lot of contraband opium
got into a consignment of crackers shipped
by it to a Honolulu firm. In the last
cargo of the Asiatic liner Mount .Lebanon
from this port there was a big shipment of
crackers, There were also some salmon
caÂ«es consigned by the Washington Feed
Company. Freight from the Mount Le
banon was discharged at Honolulu In the
morning, and the vessel sailed that after
noon for Yokohama.
The first case of crackers opened for in
fpection by the customs officers was found
to contain fifteen tins of opium. The
salmon and cracker cases were removed to
the Custom-house, where ei;rht out of
forty cases were found to contain 480 tins
of the drug. As stuted heretofore in The
Call's Honolulu advices, Samuel Lowden,
the agent for the Feed Company at Hono
lulu, was arrested and released on bail.
Manager Wittenburtr of the Portland
Cracker Company said to-day that his
company shipped a lot of crackers to
Honolulu, and has some fifteen tons ready
for shipment now, but no member of the
company can tell where the opium came
irom.
DENOUNCED ALASKA JUSTICE.
Treasury Agent Crowley's Indictment Or
dered by a Territorial
Judge.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Dec. 11.-
Unlted States Special Treasury Agent
Crowley is threatened with indictment
and prosecution in the Federal Court of
Alaska for denouncing the administration
of justice in that Territory. In charging
a Grand Jury, Judge Delany resented the
aspersion and called for the indictment of
the officer if it was found that he was re
sponsible for using such language.
Crowley is said to have attended a trial
wherein an arrangement was effected be
tween the opposing counsel for the
defendant to plead guilty and re
ceive a certain punishment agreed
upon iv advance. Croarley is reported
to have denounced the proceed in 2 as
a farce and characteristic of Alaskan
justice. Judge Dalaney instructed the
jury to indict the counsel if Crowley's
statements were true; if otherwise, to
bring in a true bill against Crowley.
Crowley is one of the best known and
most tearless treasury officials in the
Northwest and JJelany is a man of strong
resolutions.
STAFFORD ELECTS AN EDITOR.
J. It. Xourte Will Have Charge of the
Daily Palo Alto.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec.
11. â After a week's agitation the student
body decided by election who should be

HUMANCE OF STOCKTON.
Secret Wedding of Vocalist Wilkes and a
Telephone- Girl.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 11. -A few days
as;o Miss Inez M. White resigned her po
sition at the telephone station. Since
then it has been learned that she was mar
ried nearly four months ago. Her hus
band is J. B. Wilkes, the well-known
singer.
On August 19 last Miss White and Mr.
Wilkes were married by Rev. J. H. Briggs
at Burson, Calaveras County, the license
having been obtained at San Andreas.
The wedding was what the society re
porter would call a "quiet affair." It was
so quiet that nobody, save those inter
ested â the minister and the witnesses â
knew anything about it. The leason for
the secrecy is said to be a rule at the tele
phone station requiring the "hello" girls
to be single, and as Miss White desired to
retain her position for a few months nfter
her marriage she did not announce the
wedding unul she had resigned.

Lands Leased by the Cordelia
Shooting Club.
SUISUN, Cal., Dec. 11.â Since the Su
premo Court reversed the decision of
Superior Judge Buckles in the action of
Charles W. Kellogg, as trustee of the Cor
delia Shooting Club, vs. William King et
a!., the members of the club have em
ployed men to keep a vigilant watch on
the movements of outside hunters in
order that they might have the exclusive
privilege of shooting upon the grounds
known as the Chamberlain Tract, and for
which they pay a rental of $i2OO per year.
The defendants in the original suit have
bÂ«>en notified that the decision of the Su
perior Court of Solano County has been

AN ANTIDOTE
TO ALCOHOL
Excessive Drinkers How Using Vino
Koiafra With Great and
Prompt Benefit.
It Stops the Craving for Liquor, Does
v Not Intoxicate or React or ProÂ»
duce a habit of Its Own.
The medical journals have recently de-
voted considerable space to the question |
whether a product of the sterculia nut j
and a substitute for alcohol known as j
Vino Koiafra is more effective in over-
coming inebriety than the gold curs or
other so-called cures. ,
- The claim set up for Vino Kolafia is
that it is very prompt to act, and makes a
sober roan out of the habitual drinker by
supplying the place of alcohol without
producing the toxic or reactive effects of !
alcohol. In other words, Vino Koiafra is
said to satisfy the craving for strong drink j
and to efford the longed for stimulus
without the customary sequence. Need-
less to say, if this proves to be true its
importance can hardly be overstated. As
an example of the medical testimony
available on the point, we may cite that
of Dr. J. D. Crowther, an expert sin the
treatment of alcoholism. In a report pub-
lished in a late number of the Journal
of Inebriety Dr. Crowther says: â¢
"The preparation called Vino Koiafra
has been used as an antidote for the poison
of alcohol and some authorities have
called it a specific. 'â â â We have made a study
of its action in several cases of acute and
chronic inebriety. â  The plan was to dis-
continue all spirits and give two or three
ounces of Vino Koiafra every two or three
hours., Result: The acute symptoms
quickly subsided, the patient became
easy, the stomach distress and the de- >
mand for spirits also subsided. In two j
cases sleep followed, from which the pa- j
tient awoke rested. In two cases a marked
change occurred ,In , the restlessness and
excitementâ the effects of alcohol seemed
to be neutralized and the condition of the j
mind im^oved. . r.v ; t
"The action of Vino Kolnfra was that of i
a diffusable stimulant with a tendency. to \
relieve the irritation and physical suffer-
ing ,of such cEses. There are many rea-
sons for believing that its greatest value is
in replacing spirits and in lessening the
effects of '.he withdrawal of drugs." â 
( â  Professor Fran k Wood bury of Philadel-
phia calls attention in the Medical Bulle-
tin to a series of tests made with the
spbyÃmographâ a pulse-recording instru-
ment â showing the non-reactive charac-
ter of Vino Koiafra as compared with al-
coholic stimulation. >-" ;/â ;.-â¢ â¢
Both the English and American Consuls
at every African port report that no harm
follows the use of the sterculia nut by the
natives, which statement has been amply
verified as to Vino Koiafra (the derivative
and representative of the nut) by. the ex-
periments ot the athletes of Yale and other
universities, by, army experts j and by the
Fuperitrtendents of the ; ; New York Post-
office and of the Third-avenue Railroad,
New York. ; ,
' ThÂ« stimulation of Vino Koiafra is un-
like that of any other known stimulant.
It produces a sense of lightness and well
beiner, with no signs of intoxication or bad
after-affects. The respectable but steady,
every-day drinker, v who has almost un-
consciously allowed , the habit to 1 grow i
upon him until he is unable to shake it
off- is the man who is most helped and
profited by the use of Vino Koiafra. He I
changes from alcohol to the African tonic |
without difficulty and ; with no regrets or
any sense of relapse or falling away. ,"
For chronic invalids and constitution-
ally feeble persons physicians now pre- j
scribe Vino Koiafra in lieu of the danger- j
ous drug-* too long employed as tonics and
stimulants. It steadies and regulates the !
heart's action and deepens the breathing. '
As a brain stimulant Vino Koiafra causes j
no congestion or ' J excitement, while it i
greatly increases â  the capacity for mental i
labor. .â  . .--â ;:â ,â¢. â ;â â / : < â  'â â ''. " â ".'"'-;

The last day of the horse show !
The Senators talk of Cuba, but think of
buncombe.
There is a chance to Beat the funding
bill if we fight hard.
In all your holiday purchases remember
charity and home industry.
If you tail to visit the Pavilion to-day
you will regret it to-morrow.
Caesar bad hi- Urutus, Charles I his
Cromwell and Long Green his referee.
The Sunday Call will be bright, lively
and interesting. Don't fail to leave orders
for it.
The funding bill not only claims atten
tion, but enforces it. There is no way of
evading it now.
Decadent journalism may still manage
to keep in the ring, but it is not feeling as
sporty as it was.
The next Se ator who talks of liberating
Cuba should give plans and specifications
of how he intends to do it.
In his desire to be a reformer, the Czar
has stiown sagacity by deciding to begin
in Turkey and not at home.
Henry Watterson no doubt intended his
speech to suit the banquet in his honor,
but it sounded like a funeral oration.
There is lots of room in town for a Mar
ket-street improvement club, with a bi^l
membership and a progressive movement.l
Maceo must have been twins, for one of
him has been identified as dead and the
other has given pretty good evidence of
being alive.
Watterson's advice to tne gold Demo
crats to hold what they have is easily fol
lowed. It will not require much energy
to hold so little.
Long Green Lawrence does not know
enough to manage a newspaper, and yet
he probably knows too much for Hearst
to discharge him.
The Examiner and the New York Jour
nal do nut agree about Earp. Either
Willie Hearst or Long Green Lawrence is
doing some tall lying.
The announcement that the debt of the
Province of Quebec is over ?.'52,G00,000 will
give the annexationists in this country a
reason for taking a second thought.
The horse 13 no doubt well pleased with
the admiration we have given him at the
Pavilion, but he wouid prefer to have us
give him a better footing on the streets.
The assembling of the next Trans-
Mississippi Congress has been postponed
until next spring. Like everything else
in the country, it is waiting for the new
deal.
We hardly thought it of Henry Watter
son, but his desire for an American Sir
Robert Peel sounds very much as if he
want 3 something that is English, you
know.
It is reported that no office-holder under
Harri-on will be given an office by lie-
Kinley, but the report came from Wash
ington and not Canton, so it doesn't
counr.
It is about time for the Examiner to pub
li?h some more extracts irofcn the country
press showing thÂ» enemies it has made
and thusi give its readers a chance to find
something decent in its columns.
It is said the census to be taken in Rus
sia next year will be ths first in over forty
years and may be put down as another
evidence that Russia intends to be in
cluded hereafter among the nations that
count.
The best criticism on Cleveland's lan
guage in regard to Cuba is that of an
Havana newspaper, which says: "It is no
more nor no less than a series of hypo
theses." The phrase not only suits Grover,
but will probably please him.
The election of two such comnaratively
unknown men as Theuriet and Vandal to
seats in the French Academy over Emile
Zola is another proof that while almost
anybody can beat Zola in the Academy
they are generally nobodies that do it.
The public spirit which now prompts
our progressive merchants to work to
gether for local improvements will soon
impel them to the greater work of general
municipal government, and then we shall
have a street system to be proud of.
The growing indignation against Hearst
journalism in New York has led the
Nickeli Magazine to warn him that he
may yet be sent to a little town up the
Hudson, where he will change his name
from Hearst to :%'<Â». 743. Remember the
warning and don't forget the number.
The Republican Senatorial commit
tee appointed to devise legislation
for monetary reform consists of Wol
cott, Hoar, Chandler, Carter and
Gear. The majority of the commit
tee is strongly in favor of bimetallism
and international agreement, and can be
counted on to take action leading to that
end. This is significant of good results and
gives reason for believing the money
question will be satisfactorily settled and
out of politics before the next Presidential
election.
AN UNPLEASANT DUTY.
The Call considers that an explanation is due to its readers of the *" < ?Â»spn9 which
moved it to undertake the task of scourging the Examiner either out of publication
or back into decency. It is not a pleasant duty to attempt the abatement of a public
nuisance after it has reached that superlative degree of nastiness which the Examiner
has attained.
When The Call under its present management began to c'imb the ladder toward
pre-eminence among the newspapers of the Pacific Coast, it aimeii and endeavored to
be the exemplar of clean and honest journalism rather than its schoolmaster, and to
teach by daily example instead of by rod and book. It announced its purpose to es
tablish and maintain a cordial relation between itself and its contemporaries and for
nearly two years it carried this purpose fully into effect. When its rarid increase in
! circulation and it< evident possession of the confidence of the moral and decent ele
| ments of society awakened iis most envious and unprincipled competitor to vile,
: false and dishonorable attacks upon this newspaper and upon its proprietor and his
family and friends, The Call made no response to such contemptible assaults, be
lieving that the daily publication of an honest and decent newspaper would bo of
itself a sufficient answer to the public mind. So long as the Exaviiner confined itself
to this form of offending and yet maintained a semblance of public decency, its mean
and cowardly flings at the personal and private affairs of gentlemen in any way con
nected with The Call were allowed to pass with the silence of contempt which that
sort of journalism deserves.
The Call would have continued to occupy this position had not the Examiner,
driven to desperate means to maintain itself against The Call's increasing success,
abandoned all pretense of respectability and become a public offense. When its man
ager detailed women reporters to attend prize-fights, to explore the slums, to exploit
the inner depravities of society and to interview convicts and thugs, we omitted
comment on the subject, leaving to the tongue of public opinion the administration
of a merited rebuke. Even when the Examiner was convicted of the blackmail of the
Southern Pacific Company out of a lar^e sum of money its proper castigation was left
to other hands. It was not, indeed, until its owner and manager threw off every re
straint of decency and devoted the newspaper to a life of open shame; not until an
aroused and insulted publ.c sentiment demanded that the duty of The Call to the
cause of public morals required it to wield the lash ; not until the decent and reputa
ble daily and weekly journals of the entire State urged us to action upon the ground
of duty to the fair name of the profession; not until men and women who represent
the homes, the families, the morals of California, weary of guarding their doorsteps,
becan to voice their indication in personal requests; not until the stench of thÂ«
Examiner's vileness became utterly unbearable to the nostrils of decency, did The
I Call reluctantly undertake the labor of abating the public nuisance Mr. Hearsts
newspaper has become, and of lashing into at least an outward semblance of cleanli
ness its publishers and itself. Having entered upon the unsought and unwelcome
task. The Call assures its readers that it will complete it as thoroughly as the occa
sion requires and as quickly as possible; and that having done so it will hasten to
wash its hands and fumigate its clothing with the consciousness of having performed
a duty to decency in expelling a disreputable faker from the ranks of honorable and
respectable journalism.
THE COOPEE TEAGEDY.
Our local history has furnished U3 with
few tragedies so startling and saddening
as that which has resulted in the deaths
of Mrs. Sarah B. Coouer and her dau.hter
Harriet. The dreadful news spread about
the City yesterday like wildfire and car
ried distress and sorrow into a thousand
households. No woman has taken a larger
part in our civic life than Mrs. Cooper, and
| her daughter also has done much to en
dear her to the people of all classes. The
tragic ending of their lives is therefore fell
as something of a public calamity and the
I mourning lor them will be widespread
and sincere.
From evidence revealed in private let
. ters it is clear that Mrs. Cooper sacrificed
her life by reason of her devotion to her
sadly sifiiicied daughter. She knew that
her "precious child" as she called her was
subject to the dire mania of a hereditary
tendency to insanity, and yet she would
not send that much-!oved ohild to an
asylum. Though she knew that her life
was in danger every day from the dread
impulses of that fearful curse she re
mained true to her conception of a
mot tier's duly and her instinctive mother's
I love, and braved all the danger in order to
' be able to help and to soothe the sufferer
j at every moment while she lived.
"Greater love hath no one than this,
that a man should give his life for his
friend." In the fullest sense of the words
Mrs. Cooper gave her life to her daughter.
This supreme sacrifice found its greatest
and highest manifestation not in the
moment of death, which indeed came to
her mercifully in her sleep, but in those
long-drawn months of anxiety through
which she lived from the time the mania
of her daughter first declared itse f.
Human sympathy can hardly compre
hend the horror of such a situation for a
devoted and widowed mother, but it cannot
fail to give due reverence to this new
proof of the love and heroism of which
our common humanity is capable.
Of Mrs. Cooper's services to San Fran
cisco it is hardly necessary to speak.
They are well known to all and fresh in
the public mind. She has been one of the
most ardent of our workers in the cause of
education and tne success of her labors
has been such as to give her a fame as
wide as the Union. Few Californians are
so widely renowned or so justly so as the
woman whose untimely death we mourn
to-day. California has lost a great spirit
and a brave worker and has good reason
to sorrow over this mother and daughter
who were "altogether lovely in their lives
and in death were not divide 1."
WATTERSON ON DEMOCRACY.
Henry Watterson' s speech at the ban-
! quet given to him by the national execu
tive committee of the conservative Dem
ocracy must have been a great disappoint
i raent to those who heard it. It was elo
i quent, but it was meaningless. It was
lull of fine phases but lacking in counsel.
It showed ail the graces of an accom
plished orator, but not a single element of
political leadership.
By a curious freak the tone of Mr. Wat
terson's address was mainly a lament over
what he alleged to be the lack of right
leadership in the Republican paity. He
desires, it seeing, a coalition of all the
conservative forces of the country, but is
unable to see in the Republican ranks any
man who can bring about such a combina
tion. "It has," he says, "no great lender
who can combine two forces as Sir Robert
Peel did in English politics fiHy years ago,
when the Liberal Unionists formed their
coalition with the Conservatives."
This lament over an alleged lacK of a
Peel in th 3 Republican party is really
j humorous when the political situation in
j the country is considered. Here is a long
experienced politician called by hisfriends
to a banquet given in his honor, and list
ened to in the expectation that he would
pronounce some words of counsel and guid
ance for his party, who turns away from it
altogether and speaks only words of sad
ness because the opposing party does not
furnish him a desired leader. It would
seem that Mr. Watterson does not think it
worth while to even Â»alk of a possible
Democratic leader. He ignores the men
who followed Palmer and Buckncr alto
gether, and many umong those who sat at
the banquet and heard him must have felt
slighted by bis words.
All that Mr. Watterson could say to his
companions at the banquet was to urge
them to maintain their organization on
the lines laid down at the Indianapolis
convention. He declared a belief that if
they did so they would draw perhaps
2,000,000 of m?n who voted for Bryan to
support the conservative ticket four years
from now. "I see no reason," he de
clared, "why in 1900 this organization will
not be able to dictate terms to the coun
try." It was just after making these san
guine declarations that he began his
lament thatthe Republican party could not
furnish the conservative movement with
a leader. It aopear?, therefore, that his
only policy is one of dogged despairâ a
determination to hold on to a given
course, trusting to luck for followers and
praying to heaven for guidance.
It is hardly necessary to say that such a
policy will not be received with mucL i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1896.
favor by any great number of the Ameri"
can people, and hardly even by a consid
erable following of the gold Democrats
themselves. The American peonle may
be idealists in many things, but in the
management of politics they are essen
tially practical, and no strong body of
active politicians is going to maintain an
organization on the plans outlined by Mr.
j Watterson.
The Republican party will need no
American Feel to draw the conservative
strength of the country to its support. It
has in its present force of superb leaders
all that is needed to accomplish that.
This was shown during the last campaign,
when the business elements of the country
united to elect McK:nley. Those ele
ments will continue united in support of
I th 6 administration, and will be found act
ing together in 1900. As for Democracy, we
do not know where it can look for leader
ship. In default of something better, it
j might accept Bryan again, or failing him,
look for a new Moses to rise from among
tue Populists.
KEEP UP THE TIGHT.
Recent reports from Washington show
thatthe advocates of the funding bill are
sanguine of success, but there is still no
reason why the people of California should
despair. Just now the friends of the
monopoly are doing all the talking. The
opponents of the measure, the supporters
of justice and public welfare, will be heard
later on.
It seems no longer doubtful that the
administration is on the side of the bill.
Cleveland's message implied as much, and
the report from Attorney-General Har
mon seems to make it sure. This fact has
encouraged the friends of the measure,
and they are now boasting of their ability
to pass it through both houses of Congress
with a rush. They may find, however, that
they have been too hasty in their reckon
ing. There are some pretty good fiahters
in Congress on the side of the people, and
they will givÂ» a good account of them
selvs when the time comes.
Besides our California delegation,
which can be relied upon to act with
vi^or in support of the interests of the
State, there are many other Congressmen
of weight, influence and skill in parlia
mentary tactics to uphold the law of the
land against this outrageous proposition
to surrender it at the behest of a corrupt
corporation. It is still freshly remem
bered how good a right Senator Morgan al
most single-handed made last winter,
and he will come again to the front
with all his friends to help us in this
crisis.
As the case stands at present the
strength of the monopoly has been dis
played, but that of the opposition is not
yet known. The prospect therefore looks
worse than it really is. It should be
borne in mind that the opposition has
always been strong enough to beat the
bill in tiie past. From that fact we can
draw an an ury of our ability to beat it
in the final contest if we act with courage
and resolution.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
To-morrow's issue of The Call will be
an excellent family paper, full of clean,
bright, interesting literature. Not only
will it contain all the la'.est and best local
news and presented in readable style and
with the s.-al of accuracy upoa it, and not
only will its telegraphic service, as usual,
supply the fullest and most reliable in
telligence of events in this country and in
foreign lands, but the regular departments
will be replete with good things by our
able corps of special writers. Society
news, of course, will include some gossipy
horse-snow reflections; the "Fashions"
will inform you just what styles will De

the children will be treated to a page fall
of Chr.stmas anticipations, and the whist
department will be particularly gratifyinz
to students of that seductive game.
The most unique story ever written
about pioneer California will commend
itself especially to every reader in the
Golden State, whether he be pioneor or
tenderfoot. It is a splendid article, ably
written, and illustrated in the best style of
newspaper art. It will be read in the
East with as much genuine pleasure as it
wiil afford here on the shores of the Pa

An "Ode to California," by Edward
Clark, illustrated in a c arming manner
by Mr. Kahler, the talented head of The
Call art department, forms a feature of
the initial page of the Sunday supple
ment, and Jean Morris ha* an article, that
cannot fail to be greatly appreciated, on
some peculiar phases of life in the Latin
quarter.
The account of the most novel market
in the world will be a revelation to high
society, and an article descriptive of a
system of stenography in music, whereby
an aria may be reported almost after the
manner that a speech is now recorded in
shorthand, will perhaps contain some sur
prises tor our musical friends.
The number of stories and sketches is as
large as ever, and nobody should fail to
procure a copy of The Â£i;nday Call.

THE ENEMIES IT HAS MADE
Is the Monarch of the Fakers Proud of the Con
tempt in Which It Is Held by California
Journalism ?
The Following Extracts From the Country Press Are
Respectfully Submitted for Republication in
the Examiner.
CALIFORNIA'S GREATEST MISFORTUNE.
Plactrville .Nugget.
The Call is just now engaged in holding up to the gaze of the world the profli
gacy, depravity, Hastiness and filthy journalism (?) practiced by the anarch oi the
dailies, the San Francisco Exaviiner. Like a good deal of other sorts of realism it
is a most revolting sight. When the editorial and business methods of the
Examiner are summed up and dangled like some awfuj mangled corpse of a hor
ribly deformed contemptible human cur before the eyeÃ of the people, there is, to
say the very least, nothing very fascinating about it.' One turns from tne fearful
thing shuddering to think that it goes from this State as a mirror of the people
who are trying so hard to build a commonwealth that by right of resources and
class of inhabitants should be second to none.
The greatest misiortune this State has ever suffered is the Examiner, and
this in view of the wealth and opportunities of the owner to make a wiper that
snould bo a builder instead of a rampant tearer-down. VVil iam Hearst should be
the conductor of that almost Utopian thing, the model journal. Graniei his own
mental qualities are nil to a great extent, but with his money he might have sur
rounded himself with men of peerless ability in the newspaper profession. In
stead he gives us the Bierce with his plagiarized literary style and chronic bile on
the stomach. He foist* upon the public as managing editor the lickspittle, Andy
Lawrence, whose principal qualifications seem to be â first, that he names his chil
dren after the members of the Hearst family, and second, that he has a con
science of the character of a rubber band. He's not a journalist in any honor
able sense of the word. Somebody told him he was and he believed that liar and
there he is.
We know several reporters in the Examiner who can individually do more
and better newspaper work in a minute thmi Lawrence can do in a year. But
they don't name tiieir babies after tne members oj the Hearst family, and, of
course, that unfits them for any position to which this peanut butcher can aspire.
The Nugget believes that the time has come vnen the bent interests of this
State demand that the merchants and business men of San Francisco and the
people of the State should constitute themselves a committee of the whole to put
a stop to the practices of this inlernal libel on journalism, the Examiner.
AKIN TO BLACKMAIL.
Alameda Argus.
The Examiner publishes extracts from papers which disapproved of Its unfair
political course during the late campaign, with an introduction to the effect that
they are "controlled by C. P. Huntingion, depend upon his charity for sustenance,
and dare not fail to indorse any robbing scheme of hit, however monstrous." .With
out stopping to point out that the extracts treat of tne Examiner's political course
and not 01 its "fight" against tne railroad, we feel it is due to express the opinion
that not all the journals mentioned have received a tithe of the favors from Hunt
ington or demanded as many ; not ail of them put togetner, we verily believe, ever
received in an honest business way as much as the $30,000 which the Ezavriner got
by a process akin to blackmail. Certainly, not all of them together ever received
or demanded $100,000 for any service. Every one of them has a more honorable
record on the railroad question than the Examiner.
VILEST OF THE VILE.
Nevada City Transcript
The San Francisco Examiner can be truly classed as the vilest organ pub
lished on the Pacific Coast. It is a disgrace to California and only fit for the
slums of society. Tnere is no honesty or decency displayed in its columns, and
every issue seems to be worse than the last one published. Respectable people
all over the country are fleeing from it as they would from a mad doe. It was
once the pride of the State, but how changed, it now stinks in the nostrils of all
who come into contact with it.
WRITTEN BY ONE OF ITS FAKERS.
A "high-school boy" wants to know if Sharfcey "did real'y write the article
which appeared in yesterday's Examiner over his name." No, he did not; nor
did he dictate it. That article was written by one of the Examiner' s young fakers
and Sharkey's name signed to it, as most of such "letters" are manufactured.
Sharkey is an illiterate brute, who doesn't know any more of the rules of English
composition than he does about the thirty-nine articles of the English church.
THE FAKER ON THE RUN.
It is manifest that The Call is cutting into the Examiner's business with
rapid strides else the alleged "Monarch" would not devote so many columns of
its news and editorial space to its rival. More power to your elbow, Charles M.
You have the boss faker on the run â keep him going.
PANDERS TO THE LOWEST TASTE.

The Call is red hot on the trail of the Examiner and is doing good work
toward redeeming California. The "Monarch" is the most gigantic fake in the
newspaper firmament. To increase circulation it panders to the lowest tastes of â¢
the vile'and stops at nothing.
NOT FIT FOR THE FAMILY CIRCLE.
The Record can agree with The Call in every word it says respecting the
sensational nature and frequent glaring indecency of the Examiner. It is a pa
per that is not only indecent, but unreliable, and not fit to go into the family
circle.

The San Francisco Call has taken a turn at giving the sensational Examiner a
slight roasting.
ELEVEN-GORED SKIRT FOR SILK.
The most satisfactory way of making the
handsome skirt of silk and satin, now so much
worn, is with several gores, so that each gore
Can be cut out of one breadth of the material
Id one piece. Where fewer gores are used they
are of necessity wider, and the siik or satin
must be pieced out to get the width.
A ski it which is six and a ha. f yards round
the foot and has eleven gores Is shown above.
It is designed especially lor silks and narrow
fabrics, none Oi the gores measuring more than
twenty-two inches at the widest part. It is a
delightfully graceful skirt and looks equally
well in any fubric and never gets out of shape,
as the gores are cut with a straight edge to
meet a bias one at all the seams excepting in
the back, where the gores are straight through
the center, with a stay at each seam.
A skirt of Dresden silk in reseda green with
bright- colored flowers and leaves in shadowy
outlines, and narrow strides of black satin at
intervals of two inches, was worn with a black
saiin coat of the Louis XVI style. This had a
vest of chiffon wi.ich harmonized with the
skirt, having the same design of roses and
leaves woven in. A bright green satin stock
with lour large loops at the back finished the
neck, with a belt oi the same at the full vest
front.
A black satin skirt had a handsome applique
design in jet and green spangles, which
crossed the foot of the front breadth and
reached to the waist in a graceful tajering
design over the seams of the front breadth.
Some of tne new skirts are trimmed with
narrow braid at the toot set on in straight
rows or forming a small design at each seam.
Four of the eleven gores in this skirt are
gathered at the back or they may be laid in
box pleats. _____________

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Uncle Samâ J. C. H., City.During the last
war between the United States and England a
commissariat contractor named Elbert Ander
son of New York had a storeyard at Troy. A
Government inspector, who was always called
"Uncle Bam," but whose name was Samuel
Wilson, superintended the examination of all
provisions, and when they passed each case or
package was marked EA-US, the initials of the
contractor for the United States. The man
who marked the packages once being asked the
interpretation of the initials replied that it
meant E.bert Anderson and Uncle S m. From
that everything marked with the initials of
j the United States was said to belong to Uncle
Sam, and in that way Uncle Sum became the
representative of the United States.
Large Fish'-F. W., City. This correspond
ent wants to know if there ever were any fish
' large enough to swallow a human being whole.
Dr. Pusey, in "Minor Prophets," says:
Fish large enough to swallow a man have doubt
less Deen found occasionally in -he Mediterranean
Sea. The white shark swallows what It takes into
its mouth whole. Jt it physically unable to divide
us food piecemeal, into Fabncus tells us 'its
wont is to swallow down dead or living men at a.
gulp." In 1758 a sailor fell overboard in the Med
iterranean, wuen a shark toon him In its wide
throat; but the captain snot the shark, and the
aailor was rescuej from his pri.ous condition with
out injury. The captain gave the man the fljh
wnlch was exhibited throughout Kurope. It was
twenty feet ion?,' with fins nine feet long, and it
weighed 2924 pounds. Blumenbach makes men
tion of a wuitu aharii ; wuioh weizbed 10 000
pounds-, and he tell, us that horses have b en
found whole in the stomach of these monsters of
the deep. A 'Writer of the seventeenth century
on "ihe l-Uh of MarselUej" says the men of
Nice assured hi:,, they once took a Hah of the
Cants Lnrcharias family, 40J0 Pounds in- weight
In the belly of which a man, whole, was fouud.

â¢ Stone, ; Bronze and Iron - "Wildwood "
Cal. The age of stone relates to the period
when weapons and implements were made of
stone, amber, wood, bone, horn, or some easily
wrought material, ; Â«nd during which very
little or nothing was known of metals'. During
that era the people, few in number, and sav^e

with the skins of j animals. They buried their
I dead in large sepulchral chambers, covered
with Tvhat have been Ciilled cromlechs, or
girdled round by the unhewn stone pillnrs
called "Bruidical circles." The bodies were
frequently iotind unburned, often with rude
urns beside 'hem.
Dunne the age of bronze weapons and im
pit menus were wade of copper or of bronze.V
and iron anil silver were little or not nt all
known. The dead were bnrned and their a-hes
kept in urns or deposited in stone chests cov
ered by conical mounds of earth or heaps of
loose stones. In urns articles of gold and am
ber were found, but never of silver. Most of
the articles of metal appeared to have been
cast; where marks of the hammer appc" fed
it is contended that the forging or beating
must have been by ft stone hammer upon a
stone anvil. Â . Â
The flge of irou is the name applied to the
third or lÂ«st of three supposed periods. Pur
ing that era i i is believed that irou displaced
brorze in the nianuiactnre of wecions and
implements, and that silver and glass camo
into use. The dend were still occasionally
burned, but they were frequently buried with
out burning, often seated on chairs, and at
times with a horse in ;all war harness laid
besiue the body of his mnsier.
A REVOLT AGAINST BOURBON
METHODS.
Bos on 'Iran script.
What appears very much like a revolt
against thu Bourbon methods of making States
close corporation." is developing iv Texas,
South Carolina and Mississippi, in pursuance
of their policy of white domination, have vir
tually disfranchised the bulk of their colored
population. There ia a Congressman elected
for every 9092 votes in South Carolina and one
for every 5055 in Mississippi. Less than 40,
-000 voters chose the entire Mississippi delega
tion in 1894. while but 03,645 were required
in South Carolina. In Texas it takes 34,000
votes to choose a single Congressman, and
Texas does not like the difference, ana says
the arrangemen: is unfair as it is. The Gal
veston News voices the sentiment of Texas in
this matter, but lrstead of proposing to dis
franchise Texas' colored people it sugg'sts
that Concre;.s reduce the number of Congress
men irom South Carolina a d Mississippi, lo
console Texas it mt\y be said that Us progress
Is bo rapid that South Carolina and Mississippi
are in wealth, energy a d resources to Texas
what a county is to a State. Texas has treated
her colored people so well that they are golif i
ahead just like white folks. Texas is growinel
like a green bay tree, while Mississippi ac-l
South Carolina wither. J

ONE MORE DAY
WITH THE HORSES
Fashionable San Francisco
Again Around the
Ring.
GOOD FORM SEEMS TO BE
THE THING.
It Tells in Many Classes Against
the Old Style of Swell
Steeds.
W. S. HOBAHT CARRIES CFF
CUPS AND PR:Z:S.
Yet the Exhibition, So Far, Has Been
an Improvement on Former
Ones in Many Points-
Society did not grow tired of viewing
the horses on the third day of the horse
show. There was so much in the exhibi
tions that society could not possibly
ignore the one fashionable event of the
year, and, indeed, the boxes surrounding
the ring were well patronized during the
day and evening.
Nor did the show itself wane in'interest.
On the contrary, many of the events were
more interesting than on the two rjre
vious dnys, and 1 vers of the new horse
were well pleased with what they saw.
The real horsemen were there in the
morning and afternoon. They did not
think of dress suits, but went to study and
compare the hackney, hunter and coach
horse with the oldtime racer and roadster,
the dancing steed with the smooth sinele
fonter. But somehow they were not seri
ously considered a< part of the show â not
a bit more than the press representatives
who had to stand by the fence from 10
a. m. until 11 p. m. among the touts,
stable-boys and the more enthusiastic ad
mirers of horses. These men who made
they show were, like the graceful long
tailed California horse, not in it.
Walter Hobart had the whole show to
himself, with but few exceptions, as a
glance over the li*t of winners will prove.
Soon this third day it was largely a case
of one swallow making a summer. A
mera handful of exhibitors led in style,
which does not always demand a large
stable ana a million or two. but only a lit
tle attention to such detail*, as for in
stance, knowing it is not good form ex
actly to app ar in a roadsters' exhibition
in silk hat and evening suit.
Silk hats and dresÂ« suits are not seen as a
rule on the roads. Then the rh>s were not
all they shouia be. Of course there were
exceptions, but it woa'd seem that the
American bugsry is doomed to extinction,
and people might as well be in the lead â
when they are in a modern horse show.
It neerfs spirit and monpy Â«nd a special
taste to see and to understand all the
points of excellence, and this very fact was
plainly apparent yesterday when promi
nent "men with swagger reputations as
horsemen competed in fashionable classes
in livery rig 9 and ordinary street dress
against the new or !er that is oid beyond
the mountain, with its fault eÂ«s footmen,
its liveried coachmen and grooms and its
steeds full of action and display. A level
trotting roadster after the old style was
out of (lace.
The stocc on a whole was an improve
ment on that *een at the former smows.
Messrs. Crocker, Hobart, Pope, Sprpckels,
Baldwin, Parroti, Grant and Burk had
b-usKed up remarkably in the past year.
Besides, there were numerous road bean
ties in line, coming no doubt as emulous
of the aristocratic docked tail*, but they
were not in the name class as the horse
belonging to the new standard. However,
they plÂ«ased the majority of the people,
to whom hackneys full of action were too
much of a novelty to be understood.
All this is within the elliptical inclosure
called "the ring." The one disturbing
factor outside the rail. It was Mr. Bald
win from Santa Clara County with his
original evening trousers â "high-water
pants," if a vulgarism must be used. For
it never touched his low-cut shoes, and
all the young: male element of the select
set wondered what it meant. It mieht
have been the very latest, but who shall
say?
Half an hour was given after the show
opened to viewing thoroughbreds. Imp.
Atossa was shown in class 2 by A. B. Spreckels,
and she won first prize.
Starter Ferguson and Mr. Van Brunt (owner
of Cabrillo) were the jmlges. Only one two
year-old was led on to the tan bark, and that
was Kosa!bra. sired by Flambeau, the sire of
the great Crescendo. The other colts, Geysur
and Candelarih.did not appear. Rosalbrn was
given a second prize. The colt is owned by W.
08. Mucdonough. There was only one con
testant in the yearling class. A. B. Spreckels
had a liily entered by imp. Idalium, which was
likewise given a secoud prize.
In claÂ«s 32 horses were shown in harness.
U. A. Baldwin's Tristan sot first prize. W. R.
Hnbart'.s LRddie second, and Frank 11. Burkes
Jeff- - hird prize.
Mares or gelding 14 hands 3 inches and un
der 15 hands 1 inch were judped in class 33.
They were suitable for roa â  work in Â« gig or
phaeton, and the winner of the first priz was
barred from a prize in class 38. \V. S. Ho
bart's Prejudice won the blue ribbon, George
A. lopes Kemus the red rosette and John Par
rott's Bruno tc the white one.
Four pairs of trotters were shown in the
next classâ 12.
W. B, Hobart was again victorious, carrying
away the medal with his Hazel Wilkes and
Mauie Merrill hitched together behind a
buggy and driven by the owner. A. B.
Spreckels' Grove A. and Fire took second
prize, and Algonita and Algoneer. owned by
8. L. Goldstein, third. Rossie Moore and
Wand, owned by Frank H. Burke, were highly
commended. . * ,
After the trotters came the pacers entered in
class 18. Loupe, the crack of the Pacific Coast
in this class, carried off the first prize while
the house applauded, and his delighted owner,
James G. Chesley, smiled over his victory. E.
Diukelspiel'B Brilliantine got the second prize,
John F. Boyd of Oak wood Park took the third
with KMWookum, and H. E. Wise's Billy Patsy
was highly commended.
There was a better attendance in tbe
afternoon than on either of the former
days, and with all things considered the
show wai more inter*stin,j from all points
of view. If Walter Hobart bad it nearly
all to himself during the afternoon it was
only too â¢ vident that the house was w?tb
the judges, for he wot) only alter bard
battles. HÂ« took fir-*t and second prize in

in haste, as the collar caught his wind, and
incidentally put the judges' ears down to his
nose to detect sounds of bad omen, which

Tristan won the first prize, J. J. Moore's Flirt
second, W. 8. Hobart's Pickwick third, and his
LÂ»ddie was highly commended. There was
one feature In this display that fairly caught
the children in the boxes, and called forth
many expressions of admiration from the old
folkâ the pretty showing made by Miss Mil
dred Boyne on her pet pony King Biily, a bay
beauty bred on Haggin's ranch, and strictly in
it on point of breeding and the accepted
American standard.

In the evening Queen Liliuokalani had
a box at the east end of the oval, immedi
ately in the center between the north and
south entrances. With her party of half a
dozen attendants she occupied it early
and was the object of much interest. The
box was prettily decorated with flowers,
which hung in a festoon over tho front
rail.
The procession of equine events was
prefaced by an exhibition of horses for
sale under the supervision of the ring
master. N
The first competitive event was class 1,
thoroughbred stallions, five entries and three
prizes. They were shown in hand, not ridden.
The entries were: Lovdal, Burns â¢& Water
house; imp. Creighton, A. B. Spreckels;
1 rescendo, J. Naglee Burk, San Joso; imp.
Artillery, W. T. Parsons, New Zealand; Del
Paso 11, J. B. Haggln. First prize was awaided
to A. B. Spreckels' imp. Creighton; second to
J. B. Haggin's Del Paso 11.
An exhibition 01 trotting, hackney and
coaching stallions followed which wus pretty,
but lacked the interest of the competitive
events. The park tandems which followed
gave occasion to Richard F. Carman to show
wha:areal good driver may do in tne box,
and his little performance drew forth morn
appl.f use than any other event or incident of
the night. There were five entries, but only
three put in an appearance.
Two of these were Hobart'sâ Paragon and
Madison Square, and Czar and Peacock. The
other was Henry Crocker's Edwin and Doro
thy. Hobart's Cznr and Peacock took first
prize and Crocker's Edwin and Dorothy sec
ond. It was Paragon and Madison Square
that performed badly with Kemp driving, the
leader rearing and turning clear about in his
traces. Twice Carman got up, and as quickly
as he did so the team trotted away in the
prettiest form, while the audience cheered the
driver, who, so far as anybody could see, did
nothing but hold the rib.-ons.
Walter HobÂ«rt took all the prizes in the polo
pony class â all except one, for the very eood
leason that he bad no competitors but one.
His Dandelion took first, Lmidie third, Pick
wick fourth. E. D. Baylnrd's Major was given
second prize. The performances of tho ponies
were spirited.
For baddle-horses Miss Eva Coryell's Red
wood took first prize, John Parrott's Stella
second, V. Artshnovitch third and VV. S.
Hobart's Lady GreenÂ«ieeves fourth.
There were four of the entries that put in an
appearance In class 46 for best pair of horses
shown before a brougham. They were all
very handsom and ail were given a prize,
Houart's Monarch and Perform taking first;
the same exhibitor's Damrosch and Seidl
second; George H. Pope's Arsenal and Burliug
ton third ; and John Parrott's Dandy and Flora
founh.
The concluding event was the high jumpers.
There were three eniriesâ W. Wirthie's But
ton, Charles A. Neave's Bobs and W. 8. Ho
bart's Royalty. They began at 4% feet. But
ton was ridden three times to tue fence, but
positively refused to leap aud was ridden
away. Bobs took the 4JÂ£ ihree times, touch
lug each time, biM could uo no better.
Royalty did Detler. He took the 4% rather
badly, but kept improving and took v finally
at 5 feet and took the first prize.
Ex-Queen Liliuokalani was dressed in
black and looked much better than pic
tures of her made her appear. In the box
with her sat Colonel and Mrs. G. W. Mac
farlane of Honolulu and their niece. Miss
Gardie Mhcfarlane; Mrs. Ellen Graham of
New York, but formerly of Honolulu, and
two personal attendants to her Majesty.
A great many persons visited the box and
paid their respects during the evening.
Speaking of the horse show, the Qupen
declared herself very much pleased with
the whole entertainment, and particularly
with the display of two-horse closed car
riages in class 46, an exhibition w!i eh she
dec ared compared favorably with any
thing of the kind she had ever witnessed,
and she h d seen the grand parade at
Hyde Park, London, on the occasion of
Queen Victoria's jubilee.

THIEVES AT THE SHOW.
Ingenious Rascals Tear a Hole In
the Pavilion Wall.
While the band has played and the
fancy steppers of various sorts have been
stirring up the tan bark in the Pavilion,
tb Saves have cast covetous eyes at various
movable articles, like whips, pieces of
harness and so on. I'he total value of
such easily transferable articles in the
Pavilion is considerable, running up into
the thousands of dollars. Everything,
being for show, is naturally of the finest,
and even a satcliel full of trappings would
have some value.
There are some thieves who are enter
prising enoueh to tear a hole through one
side of the Pavilion and crowd through
the aperture. This would be less credi
ble if the deed had not been actually ac
comnhsiied. The happening dates back
to Thursday night.
The construction of the shell of the
Pavilion is slight. There are upright and
cross timbers and a sheathing of rustic
boards on the outside, but no inner
sheathing. Thieves evidently made a
study of tLis situation.
Thursday night a hammering was heard
by some vorsons in the Pavilion while tne
show was progressing. No one seemed to
pay any attention to it. There was so
much going on that no one, in the Pavilion
had any visible concern in this manifesta
tion, which occurred on the Polk-street
side. The thieves removed one of the rus
tic boards on Folk street and made an
aperture large enough for a slim man to
crawl through. If any one noticed this
no one interfered.
For a time street gamins were supposed
to be stealing a peep at the show, although
there was nothing but stalls and horses to
see from that point of view.
No person was seen to enter from the
street, but someone entered with felonious
purpose and stole something belonging to
McÂ»<ab and Smith. Rumor goes that
whip* and harness, which were banging
in easy reach, were stolen, but this is de
nied. ' It is conceded only that a headstall
was taken. Rumor also has it that one or
two other exhibitors met with some loss,
but if this is true the particulars nave been
carefully kept secret.
Certain it is that two detectives went
through the Pavilion yesterday and ex
amined the boie, which was boarded up
during the day. The story of one or more
thefts varies the conversation concerning
blue ribbons, premiums and so on.

A GRADE WANTED
FOR SUNSET
Important Meeting of Nine
teenth Avenue Property-
Owners.
Supervisors to Be Asked to Es
tablish an Oificial Grade in
the District.
Complaint That Prop3rty Is Overas
sessed in tb,e Suburb on Account
of the Climate.
Property- owners interested in the im
provement of Sunset district, particularly
in opening a roadway along what is known
on the map as Nineteenth avenue, held an
enthusiastic meeting last night at 20
Eddy street.
The greater part of the session was oc
cupied in discussing the feasibility Oi
establishing the official grade of the dis
trict, so that when work was done there
would be no mixing up of oflicial and un
official grades.
It was reported that the cost of estab
lishing the grade would be $3200, and it
was suggested that a committee should
be appointed whose duty should bs to
appear before the Board of Supervisors
and petition for an appropriation of that
sum. If tne present boaid would not do
it the new board could be appealed to.
At the worst a county road could be
put in for the present, argued some of the
members, but there would be some diffi
culty on account of drifung sands. Ther*
were two and >i half blocks on Nineteenth
avenue where precautions should be taken
against this evil.
George Green said that in all probability
there would be in tiie near future an elec
tric road from the park to lngleside, and
he was of the opinion that the sooner
Nineteenth avenue was laid out the sooner
would the electric road be buiit. He
moved the appointment of a committee
with instructions to get an appropriation
from the Supervisors to establish an offi
cial grade.
Mr. Larsen expressed the opinion that
it would be better to have a county road
with the natural grade constructed for
the present. He succesied a roadway 46
feet wide, with sidewalks or curbs, until
the blocks were built upon and otherwise
improved. There were five square miles
in the uistrict, and on the map had been
laid out five streets 80 feet wide and some
70 feet wide. It was destined to be the
most beautiful residence part of the City,
he said, but there was not a street in the
whole tract. The climate out there, he
added, was finer than that of Sausalito,
Belvedere, Berkeley or San Rafael. It is
true, he admitted, that it blows a little
and is foggy out there once in a while, but
that did not prevent it from Having a mag
nificent climate.
Mr. Larsen complained that the Asses
sor had made a mistake and assessed the
climate as well as the land. For instance,
one oi his blocks was assessed for $4000,
while the block next to it wa3 sold about
a month ago for $2500. The people in that
district paid considerable sums in taxes,
and they had not received anything from
ihe City in return.
It was decided to instructthe committee
to visit A. B. Spreckels, Cornelius O'Con
:ior, Charles Webb Howard, S. W. Leane
and other influential citizens in order to
secure their co-operetion.
The chair appointed George Green, R.
T. Brodekand Messrs. McMahon, Fink and
pope as the committee, and the meeting
adjourned subject to the call of the chair.
It is estimated that there are in Wales
about 910,000 i-eople who speak Welsh,
and abou: 240,000 out^ule the Principality.

ROLLNG-MILL MEN
GO BACK TO WORK
A Compromise Effected
Which Is Satisfactory
All Round.
The Cut in Wages Will Not
Be More Than Ten
Per Cent
It Simply Cats Off an Advance Made
Sf me Time Ago, Resuming the
Old Rate.
Tbe men who went on strike at the Pa
cific Koliing-miil a few days ago, because
of a threatened reduction in wages, will
return to work this morning, tne diffi
culty having been adjusted. The men
yesterday, through a committee, proposed
to Superintendent Noble a compromise
which, although it was very much more
to the advantage of the men than the
terms proposed by the company, was ac
cepted.
The proposed reduction affected only
the men in the ten-inch and the bar mill,
and contemplated a cut of from 25 to 35
per cent.
About two years ago an advance of 10
per cent was made in the wages of the
men voluntarily by the company. Tne
men, having discussed the situation for
two days at their leisure, decided to make
a proposition to go back to work under
their old rate of wages, cutting off tbe 10
per cent that had been added.
The committee called upon superin
tendent Noble yesterday morning, made
their proposition, and the superintendent,
hearing them through, assented to it and
told the men to go to work.
Accordingly tha men employed in the
larger mill will go to work this morning
and those employed in the small mill will
resume work on Monday.
Both the men and "the mill" seem to
be very well pleased at the settlement of
the difficulty. The men admit that there
is eood reason in the condition of trade to
warrant a reduction of wages. The price
of finished iron is low and in the West
here the distance from sources of supply
of raw material makes it difficult to com-
pete.
The proposed reduction only affects the
wages of some fifty men.
Larry McMahon, foreman of the mill,
took occasion yesterday to contradict some
statements that have been made in print
regarding conditions at tbe mill. "It is
not true," lie said, "that the use of oil has
been discontinued in the mill because it
proved a failure and that the changes in
the fittings to resume the use of coal had
been made at great cost. That is all rank
nonsense. The fact is the use of oil was a
marked success and there was no reason
why it should bo discontinued except that
they raised the price until it became dearer
to use than coal.
"They offered o'l to us cheap at first and
we made certain changes for its use. T^en
they thought ttiey nad a cinch on us and
raised the price. So we simply quit the
use and went back to coal. Tiie fact is
the cost of ttvb v change in fitting for coal
was a mere trifle.
"Now as to the reduction, in wages it is
â¢ SEW TO-DAY.

( money when you take anything j \
i to purify the blood except
< Ayer's Sarsaparilla. ;
just this way: The price of iron is low
and the price of Jabor in the East is low
and to compete here the price of labor
had to be cut. Mr. Noble has always put
up wages when the price of iron warrants
it. I have seen it done three times vol
untarily in this mill. When iron is low
then a cut has to be made. It, is true that
a compromise has been effected of a 10 per
cent cut and the men come back to work
to-morrow and Monday."

THE SPORTING WORLD.
Doings of Lovers of the Gun, the Rod, the Ring,
the Track and the Wheel.
A very excellent programme of races |
has been arranged to take place to-day at \
the Velodrome track. Weather permit- j
ting, several club runs will be held to
morrow.
The Olympic Club is still tryine to ar
range a meeting between Corbett and
Fitzsiramons to be held in this City under
its auspices, but Fitzsimmons will not ;
agree to any proposition until he learns i
from Dan Stuart the result of his confer- j
ence with Corbett.
Several football games will be played
to-day and to-morrow baseball contests
will take place at the Central Park and
Presidio athletic grounds.
A tug-of-war whicti will continue each
evening of next week will be the principal
feature of aport at sutro's bath?.
The annual meetine of the Field Trial
Club will be held next month near Bakers- j
field, Kern County.
THE WHEELMEN.
Velodrome Races To- Morrow and j
Club Runs Sunday.
Actual raining is the only thing that
will prevent to-day's meet at the Velo
drome from being held, and if the weather j
is pleasant from noontime on the races ;
will go ahead as if nothing had happened, j
FLOYD A. McFARLAND, the Crack Professional Who Will Ride
at the Velodrome To-Day.
The stands are all covered and sheltered,
so that the seats will always be dry, and
the tracks being banked the water runs
Dff directly it fall?, and the boards dry j
quietly. It is the intention of the man- i
agement to go ahead with the roofing of
the entire place at once, and then the
meets they may hold will not be subject
to climatic conditions.
The programme to-day is not so good as
it has been for the previous rr.t-ets. There j
are only two competition events with
about fifteen entries in each. The absence
of the Terrill brothers and Wells in the |
professional race will be noted, and the j
Velodrome people will wish they were in. I
The differences between them and "Bob"
Terrill should and probably will be satis
factorily adjusted this week.
Max Morris, a professional from Texas,
has arrived here and wiil be seen at the
next meet on Christmas day. This will
be a star meet, as the programme will be
of exceptional merit, and besides the
riders now in competition at the track,
Ziegler and Gardiner will be seen. John
F. Stayer, the Portland professional, re
ceiveda message announcing his father's
death Thursday, and leit for home imme
diately.
R. G. Barton is here, representing the
Fresno meet to be hela next Saturday, the
19tb, in conjunction with the citrus fair
now going on there. A new three-lap
dirt track has been constructed, and it is
paid to be very fast. ' Tne races will be a
mile scratch and a two-mile handicap,
professional, and two amateur races at
the same distances and conditions. Tnere
will also be tandem racing and exhibition
recorJ trials. A party is being made up
to go down from here Thursday night, re
turning Sunday. All the professionals
now quartered at the Velodrome will go, ;
and most of the officials. A varied line of
entertainment has been arranged for them.
More competitive riding and fewer so
called exhibitions and record trials at the
Velodrome wculd suit the public better.
If Manager Fawcett does not thinic so let
him make inquiries among his own ofa
cials or bit in the grandstand and hear the
remarks about him. A half nour spe' t
thusly will suffice. The amateur riders
ar- deserving of more attention than they
are receiving, too. A big drawing card
would be the matching of, say, Kenna,
Squires, Mott and Deimas. Who will pick
the winner in that quartet and back him
if all are in their best condition? It
would be a tossup surely for choice.
Only one bicycle snow will be held in
New YorK this winter, the Madison-Square
Garden Company having abandoned its
Droposed eihi&ition in favor of a military
bicycle tournament. This decision will
leave the field clear ior the show of the
National Cycle Board o: Trade, which will
be held in tne Grand Central Palace, New
York, from February 6 to 13. This will j
unquestionably be the largest nnd most
important show in the history of ihe trade
in this country or in Europe. One thing
warranting tnis statement is the fact tbat
over 500 spaces will be occupied by exhib
itors. After this show there wiil be an
exodus of all the professional raci;ig men
for California to begin their 1897 training.
The most important ones who will come
are Baid, Cooper, Johnson and Michael.
I have received personal letters from both
Bald and Cooper saying they will surely *
com**, and incidentally asking to bo re- |
ruembered to their many friends out here.
The League of American Wheelmen' has
reached a membership of 70,550. Trie an
nual meeting of the North California
Division will bo held this ?venin^ at the
rooms of the Bay City Wheelmen, 441
Golden Gate avenue, when the new board
of officers will take their seats, and bear
the reports of the variona committees.
Chief Consul Kerrigan will also mate his
committee appointments for the ensuing
year.
Of the many fine three-lap tracks built
in Southern California last fall and early
this year the one at Pasadena seems to be
the only one now available should some j
of the Eastern riders come to this State '
for record-breaking purposes this winter
and want to go south. The San Bernar
dino track was only partly built, and wet
ground was used, so only one meet was
ever he'd on it. Santa Ana, which was a
splendid track, has gone back to the
owners of the land. The railroad's track
at Santa Monica is blacklisted for allow
ing Sunday racinp. The Riverside track,
which is fair for competition, though
kite-shaped, is also washed out at present
from last month's rains. The Reel lands
track is fair for competition, but there is
do club there and only a' lew wheelmen,
so no meets have been neid on it this
year. It will probably be kept up, how
ever. The Pasadena track is almost like
the one at El Paso and very fast". The
members of the Crown City Cycling Club
there are preparing for a big meet on it
New Year's day. There are a great many
fast riders in the south, among whom
may be noted Hill, Delay, Cote, Rowan,
Woodville, Haver, Campbell, Rodriguez,
Lacey. Mossy, Casenave, Leadbetter,
Ruess, Cromwell, Dickerson. Bell, Tornp
kins. Cowan, Brotherton, D. Cromwell.
Tabor, Peach, Rogers, Clark and Nye.
The Bay City Wheelmen's pool tourna
ment has been decided, the winner* of the
first four prizes being J. M. Pike, John S.
Leavitt, A. J. Menne and A. E. Kellom.
The deciding games were played Thurs
day night and were very interesting.
If the weather is pleasant to-morrow
Captain Lewis and tne other road officers
of the San Francisco Club will be the hosts
at a luncheon spread for the members at
the conclusion of a blind run. Should the
weather be disagreeable the function wiU
be postponed one week. The club held its
first annual party Thursday evening at
Union-square Halt ana it was a distinct
social siiccpss.
Captain Day has railed the postponed
run of .tk% Bay City Wheelmen to Laundry
Farm for to-morrow, but at this writing it
looks as if the weather might again inter
fere, in which event it will go over a week.
"Bob" Lennie's ordinary run is on for to
morrow morning under the same condi
tions. Lennie, Plummer, Smyth, Mohrig,
Knapp, Tom Doane, myself and a lot of
other old-timers who have been training
for this recherche event will grow stale if
it is postponed much more. Spaiding.
THE BOXERS.
Clubs That Are Blddincr for the Fitz
simmons and Corbett Fight.
It can be safely said that unless the
Olympic Club can compete with Eastern
clubs in bidding for the proposed Corbett
and Fitzsimmons match the great pugi
listic event of the year will not take place
on this side of the big mountains.
The Olympic Club has missed several
â¢rood opportunities of enriching its
treasury within the past year simply be
cause it was too slow in bidding for star
attractions.
It could have had the Sharkey and Fitz
[ simmons and the Corbett and Sharkey
i contests if it had manifested the least en
terprise. The club under whose auspices
these contests were held made money.
Now the Olympic has an opportunity of
captunne a snng little pot by securing a
! meeting between two of the most noted
} fighters of the day, but according to the
j ponny-wisÂ«-and-pound-foolish ideas of
I ihose of its members who have been se-
I lected to arrange for a meeting between
I the champions of the ring it is extremely
doubtful if Bob and Jim will settle their
j long-pending dispute on this side of the
big mountains.
Although $10,000 is unquestionably a
very nice sum of money to offer two men
for a ten-round contest, which will doubt
less draw between $30,000 ana $40,000 from
the spectators, there can be no gainsaying
â  the fact that Fitzsimmons and Corbett
will box wherever they can get the best
financial inducements, provided a finish
fight, under Dan Stuart's auspices, cannot
be agreed upon.
Stuart has offered $15,000 for a finish
fight. Fitzsimmons has consented, and
probably to-day Corbett will give his an
swer. If it should be in the negative, then
the Olympic Club and other clubs that are
looking for the mil' wiu be afforded an
opportunity to bid, and the slowest in the
race will be sure to lose the golden plum.
Martin Julian, the manager and backer
of Bub Fitzsimmons, has stated that Jim
Corbett was certainly "off his base."
"I will allow that Corbett, for in
stance," said Julian, "is vpry anxious to
fight Bob, but why does he try to get away
from our original proposition?
â¢'Corbett certainly is aware that we have
a forfeit posted for a fight to a finish, and
why is it that he does not say so in his
letters and dispatches to the Oivmpic
Club?
"It is useless for me to arcue this ques
tion. I have repeatedly stated to the rep
resentatives of the press that in case we
! cannot arrange lor a finish fight arrange
| ments will be made with the club that
j will offer us the most flattering financial
I inducements.
"Now, then, we have had excellent offers
from different clubs, and what surprises
me most is that Corbett has made no men
tion of them in his letters to his friends in
this City.
"The Broadway Athletic Club of New
York, of which O'Rourkeis president, has
offered $26,000, or a percentage, for a.'
twenty-rounrt i ntest. The Greater Ath
letic Club, of which Warren Lewis is gen
eral director, has offered a purse of $26,000
for twenty rounds, with the proviso that
no side wager can go.
"Geinslinger of the Bohemian Club has
1 made an offer of $27,000 for twenty rounds.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1896.
Now then the. Olympic Club of this City
has a 'bid' of ?10,000 lor ten rounds.
"I understand that the latter club will
offer $15,000 for fifteen rounds, but with
all due respects to the Olympic, it is
not in the rncs with the Eastern
clubs already mentioned, consequently
I cannot understand why it is that Corbett
has shown such marked desire to fight un
der its auspices when he can do better else
where.
"A tieht to a finish is what I want, and
you can say that 1 will not agree or take
notice of any proposition until Dan
Stuart informs me that there is no possi
bility of him carrying off the proposed
finish fight between Bob and Jim.
"As for the referee, there io only one
man who must act, and his name is
George Siler, who is sporting editor of the
Chicago Tribune.
"Corbett and Fitzsimmons agreed upon
him at a recent meeting held in New
York, and if it shculd napnen that the
contest takes place in this City Siler will
be the man who must referee tne contest.
"Now you have the full particulars, and
that is all I can say in tbe matter, so tar as
the prospective right between Filzsimmons
and Corbett is concerned.
"You can add, however, that Bob 13
just as anxious as Jim to have a final set
tlement of this mooted question decided,
but we do not propose to get the worst of
any future argument, as we have had a
pretty good dose so far."
The following extract from a letter was
received recently by Professor Watson of
the Olympic Club from B. John Angle,
who is referee of the London National
Sporting Club:
It is my ambition to see how boxing contests
are managed in the country of your adoDtlon,
as I am not so stnpidly conservative as to lma
fjine that we (the old country) are without
bit mish. La vigne and Solly Smith treated our
champions in very unceremonious fashion,
but in justice to Burge I mv.st claim that he
never ought to box at the weight. Willy Smith
was stale and in nothing like the form shown
by him when meeting good men and conceding
a lot of weight. Do notthink that I wish to de
iract in the least irom the victory gained by
our visitors. They are both Mining boxers,
hitting hard wuh both hands and thoroughly
game. Ab you have learned through the Sports
man. Corbett will not be permitted to box be
fore the National Sporting Club, his utterftnees
which appeared in American papers concern
ing the management 01 the club very naturally
causing great indignation among the mem
bers. 1 do not believe him to be responsible
for these statements, as he was courtesy itaell
when over here, and as a professional boxer
would naturally be very careful of his reputa
tion.
Ned Donnelly is thriving. His wonderful
system of tuition will untortunately die â with
him, unless you ultimately elect to return
home.
FOOTBALL GAMES TO-DAY.
Several College Championship '
Matches to Be Played.
The first annual intercollegiate foot- !
ball match^between the teams represent
ing St. Mary'a College and Santa Clara
College will be decided this afternoon at
Central Park. Doubtless a large and en
thusiastic crowd will witness tbe game,
as it promises to be very hotly contested.
The Santa Clara College eleven comes
up as a dark horse, though with, it is
said, some very encouraging criticisms
from Captain Fickert of the Stanford
team. The men have been coachoi by |
Sbeebv of the Olympics and by other j
football players, while St. Mary's College !
has recently had the valuable instruction |
of Stickney, the Olympic coach, and of
Wyckoff, the old Reliance fullback.
The line-up of the two teams is as fol
lows:
Santa Clara College. Position. St. MÂ»ry'a College.
Berg L K. R Armipo
Bride I. T. X... Butler
Emery L. G. R Taylor
Uj'.oia C Pamaiiiesto

King Q Hastings
Nrtson U li. X Mo^uri (cajitaio)
Burkliam R. H. L Flood
Avarado F McCartney I
The Santa CJara College team will come
up in a special car decorated in the college
colors and accompanied by ihe college
band. Gam.c will be called at 1 :30 o'clocK,
rain or snine.
Another match of almost as great im
portance will be tnat for the State aca
demic championship between Oakland
High School and St. Mattbaw's Hall of
San Mateo. The game will be played
this afternoon at tho Presidio Athletic !
Grounds. Oakland Hi-ih School iias been i
practicing since it? last game under the
instruction of the Arlett brothers and
ssveral other members of tne Reliance
team. "Tommy" Code, the old Stanford
and Olympic quarter, and Porter, the
Olympic and California player, have been
coaching the San Mateo team.
Wnat gives promise of being an In
teresting football game will be called this
forenoon at 10 o'clock on the Sixteenth
and Folsom streets grounds between
the elevens of the Alameda Uni
versity Academy and the Lick Poly
technic School. The teams have both
won honors on the gridiron and are
| well matched. The Academy team re
cently defeated that of the Oakland Hi?;h
School, which played a tie with the Lowell
team and then ignominiously defeated it.
The Lick team is adjudged the strongest
amateur team in the vicinity of the City,
and would probably carry off the trophy
of the Academic League were it not de
barred tor having joined too late.
The undefeated Y. M. C. A. team, that
claims the light-weight football cham
pionship of the Pacific Coa3t, will meet
tho Cogswell Coiiega eleven in a match
game this afternoon at California League
grounds, Sixteenth and Folsom streets.
Game will be called at 2:30 o'clock.
Though the Y. M. C. A. eleven average
less than 131 pounds stripped, they are
willing to concede nine pounds to the
man and play any football team on the
coast weighing less than 140 pounds to the
man stripped.
Following is the line-up of the two
teams and tne stripped weichts of the
men, arranged as they oppose each other
in the game:
Cosswell College. Position. Y. M. C. A.

football game to-morrow forenoon at the
Presidio Athletic grounds. Company M
will probably secure games later with
Company B, League of the Cross, with
Cogswell College and with Company H,
League of tbe Cross.
At Stanford University the contest for
Varsity football captain has narrowed
down to two men, Cotton and Carle,^ap
tain Fickert having yesterday announced
his intention of not again, running in
spite of the efforts of many of his friends
to advance his name. The election will be
held next Tuesday.
THE OARSMEN.

bers out every Sunday to select the best
material lor a crew to enter the Carniv al
ol the Golden Gate regatta.
The building committee was given per
mission t(b complete the interior of the
new boatbouse. It is to be finished in first
class style, and when finished will be the
finest and roomiest boat and club house on
the coast.
Peter Christiansen of Fairbaven, Wash.,
an old timer, was given a hearty reception
at the boathouse last Sunday. He has
been absent six years and was very much
surprised at the" progress made, and said
the present quarters surpassed any that
were to be seen on the coast.
The first division of the Naval Reserve
arÂ£ out every Sunday keeping themselves
in trim for their next race with the victori
ous second division. They have not given
up hope of flying the beautiful pennant
on their boat.
The South End Rowine Club met in

Cutter, George Bares, Joseph Foley,
Henry Bode, James Pall?s, Dan Connelly,
William Humphrey, A. J. Fritz and John
A. Lenahan.
The election will be held on Tuesday
evening, December 22. An exciting meet
ing is expected, as tno candidates are
making strong lights for election.
The Alameda Rowing Club has arranged
a skiff race between Dr. Dennis and Eu
gene Hadcock, which will take place on
Sunday, December 20, over the Alameda
course. The men are the club's leading
oarsmen, and as the club medal is the
prize a close race is expected.
THE GUN.
More Trouble Expected on the
Sulsun Marshes.
Judge Buckles of Solano County has
issued injunctions which will be served
on hunters who are found trespassing on
the Cordelia Gun Ciub preserve. This in
a heavy blow to the Mallard Club, tha
members of which have betn enjoying
pretty good sport of late in the Suisun
marshes.
Late reports from Jersey Landing and
Antioch state that duck-shooting on the
river has been very good, and are to the
effect that the sportsmen who have visited
those places have enjoyed first-class
shooting.
Messrs. Casey and Cleary left for Jersey
Landing last evening. They expect to
return on Sunday with a large number of
mallard and canvasback.
In case the hunters should happen upon
a good snipe patch Mr. Casey ordered 500
shells loaded with No. 10 shot prior to
his departure. He hopes to be able to
bag at least one dozen "Englishmen"
with that number of cartridges.
Frank Dolliver bogged three jack
rabbits, two cotton - tails and a wood
| chuck last Sunday near Point Reyes.
John Kerrigan and a friend bagged fifty
i six quail last Sunday near Tocaloma.
Harry Golcher and a companion did not
succeed in bagging a good mess of quail
last Sunday on Golcher's favorite quail
grounds, near Point Reyes. Mr. Golcher
will try his luck to-day in tho hills near
Hamlet station.
Good quail and cotton-tail rabbit-shoot
ing can be had in the sandhills west of
TomaleF.
John K. Orr bagged seven quail and two
snipe last Sunday on the Country Club
preserve.
O. Bransdorff shot thirteen robins and
eleven larks with a parlor rifle last Sunday
near Oiema.
Hunters who shoot on the Alviso
marshes report that the bay is literally
alive with all kinds of wild ducks, and
thai they expect good shooting the first
good storm from the south.
ROD AND REEL.
Anglers Who Caught More Water
Than Fish Last Sunday.
The announcement in last Saturday's
i paver that some good catches of steel
j heads were made at the mouth of the
Paper-mill CreeK and in the tidewaters of
Russian Rivor was a means of inducing
several devotees of the rod to visit those
favorite resorts.
Unfortunately the water in the Paper
mill, which was heavy after the late rain
storm, receded very quickly, leaving the
mouth of the stream almost as dry as it
was during the summer months. A few
small fish were caught in the big pool op
posite "the white house," but generally
speaking the anglers who wet lines in the
tidewaters caught more water than fish.
Among those who visited the Point and
returned with empty baskets were Charles
Precht, Frank Dolliver, Louis Rondeau,
Senator Sidney Hall. J. McGregor, George
Walker, Al Smith, Judge Evans, Chaplain
Terry, G. Cooper, W. Kelly and WiHiam
Cooney.
Messrs. Harmon and Hoffman caught
some small fish in the Larkspur lagoon,
j and as the tide will answer to-morrow
some good sport sliould be had near the
bath-house.
John Bntler, Charley Green, C. More
house, A. Wilson and Chief of the Fish
Patrol Babcock trolled for steelheaas in
the Russian River, near Duncans Mills,
last Sunday.
Only a lew small fish were caught, but
Butler succeeded in catching an excellent
ducking, having taken a perfect header
into the river. It is presumed that
"Honest" John was feeling a bit warm
and was anxious to see what he
was capable of accomplishing in ice-cold
water with his rubbers on. John Galla
gher, the champion angler of Oakland,
fished him out with his favorite "roll"
hook In a most scientific manner. It is
safe to fay that there will not be any fish
ing worthy of note until after tho next
storm.
TUG-OF-WAR.
The Great Tournament Will Com
mence To-Morrow at Sutro's.
The great tug-of-war tournament be
tween the teams representing in their
make-up the great nations of the earth
will commence to-morrow at Sutro s
Bath?.
In the afternoon there will be five pulls
between the teams, the names of which
will be made known to-morrow afternoon
immediately aiter the drawing for posi
tions.
Manager Frees states that the reason
why the drawing will not tafco place this
evening is to prevent as far aa possible
gambling on the results. Mr. Frees is de
sirous that this contest be kept as free as
possible from any stain of hippodrome,
that may result if gambling on the re
sults were tolerated. He says that $1500
in ca3h prizes wiil be given, and that the
first team detected in the act of "throw
ing" a contest will be summarily ejecnud
from the building and debarred from fu
ture contests held in the baths under his
management.
The referee has not as'yet been selected,
but in all probability Billy Jordan, the fa
mous master of ceremonies, wiil be se
lected for the olfice.
On Sunday evening the fivo teams that
are not called upon to contest in the after
noon will try conclusions on tne cleatod
platform. Every evening of next week
there will be five pulls. The rinal con
tests will be held on Sunday, December2o.
As a preliminary to the great tourna
ment Manager Frees has arranged for a
/our-round boxing bout between Tom
Sharkey and -Danny Needham, his
sparring partner. Doubtless there will be
an immense gathering of tne lovers cf
good sport at Sutro's, to-morrow.

Sacramento Sporting: News.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Dec. 10.â Hunters
report ducks more than plentiful, but
hard to approach, as they affect the open
country and only come within range dur
ing the days on which the north wind
blows heavily. Geese are scarce this year
and but few have been brought into mar
ket, while snips are fat and plenty. A
large number of gray squirrels are Â£>eing
brought in, and it is reported that down
in the foothill country the deer are more
numerous than ever before known. Russ
Flint and S. Upson, who have ju3t re
turned from a quail nunt near Pilot Hill,
El Dorado County, report having seen
eight deer in one band during their out
ing. They had very good success at the
quail, killing seventy in one day's hunt.
John Brown baeged fifty-nine ducks in a
day's outing this week, mostly mallard;
but Frank Coons and John Beckley, who
were out two days, only got rive ducks be
iween them. Russ Flint and Henry Ger
ber, who were the puasts of J. Burnham
and Chris Ecklon this week, the old-lime
lovers of the dog and gun, of Folsom,
state that they enjoyed great sport afield.
Ecklon is noted throughout the StÃte as
always possessing the best strain of dogs,
and has a National reputation as a trainer
and handler. Independently wealthy he
finds his chief enjoyment in the fields and
mountains, and an invitation to join him
in a hunt is always sought after by all
lovers of sport.
The inhabitants ofÂ»Washington, in Yolo
County, have started an athletic club, to
be known as the West End Club, and are
fitting up their rooms in preat shape.
They claim to ';ave material which with
but a little training will make a cooJ
showing among the boxers and athletes
of older clubs. The Sacramento and
Woodland High School football teams
will line up for contest on Saturday at
Agricultural Park and a hot game is ex
pected. The boys are all light weights,
but tire well trained, having had the ad
vice and training of that old football vete
ran, Chick Harrison. The personnel of the
Sacramento team is: Center, B. Smith, 163
pounds; right guard, W. Qninton, 158
pounds; left guard, \V. Angus, 163 pounds;
right tackle, F. Cannon, 150 pounds; left
tacKle, S. Dicuson (captain), 150 pounds;
right end, Cowder, 156 pounds; left

ney, 140 pounds; fullbark, Ira May, 155
pounds; quarterback, J. Scott, 150 pounds;
substitutes â Willi, Sherburn, Butler,
Smith and Rowen.
There will be great sport at the Coursing
Park next Sunday for those interested in
coursing, as tbe association has bung up
two purses, one ror puppies and the other
for dogs of all aaes, with a special purse
for the winner of the first in each event.
H. H. Devine, secretary of the Park Asso
ciation, will act as judge, and A. S. Cum

Astonishing Record of Paioe's Gelery
Compound Among the Sick,
The fact that Paine's celery compound
is to-day relied on and recommended,
both in public and in their own family j
circle, by so large a portion of the most |
prudent and thoughtful people in every
community, should not be overlooked in
determining one's choice of a remedy.
Paine's celery compound is the moat
successful, the most warmly praised rem-
edyâ just as it was at the time of its dis-
covery the most talked ofâ ever offered by !
a physician to his fellow practitioners nnd 1
to the public. Paine's ceiery compound i
has more than fulfilled the great things j
that were expected of it when it was first !
announced to medical me/i as the discov- j
e.yofthat distinguished scientist, Prof, j
Edward E. Pheips, M.D., LL.D. It is the I
grandest invigorutor and strengthener in
the world. It offers an escape from nerv-
ous exhaustion, neuralgia, sleeplessness

"I have taken a number of bottles of
Paine's celery compound," says Mrs. E.
Warren Davidson of 302 Warren aye.,
Cuicago, ''and consider it lbÂ« best of
remedies in cases of ii:somnia arising from
torpid liver, neuralgia, rheumatism, etc.
It has done for me an that is claimed for
it, and I cheerfully indorse it."
We all know women who are living on
the "ragged edge" of nervous oxbaustion.
They eat their food without jelish, sleep
without refreshment and worrj along day
by day half sick, but refusing to believe it.
These women who are fartter along in
poor health than thoy think tre the very
persons who would tind an astonishing
help in Paine's celery conrponnd. Its
regulating action on their jangled nerves,
and it's revivifying action upon digestion
and assimilation are just wlat their sys-
tem is in need of. Why should anyone
not try it?

TO THE LAST
Marshall J. Miller Dies on
the Gallows at San
Quentin.
Declarations of Innocence Made
During His Last Hours
on Earth.
His Crime the Eiling of an Aged
Man at M?.rv viile for His
Gold.
SAN QFENTIN, Cal., Dec 11.â The
quickest of the many executions in the
State Prison here was the hanginsj of
Marshall J. Miller at 10:16 o'clock
this morning. It was but a few sec
onds over a rninnte from the time
Afi Her put his foot on the stairs leading
up to the platform until he had been shot
through the trap and the doctors had
hold of his wrist counting the decreasing
heart pulsations.
The deatn watch at his cell had begun
eight days ago. He had been hopeful
)of a respite from the Governor until last
night. Then he abandoned himself to
his fate, but bore up well. He sent for a
priest yesterday, and Father Conley of
San Rafael was with him much of the
day. Last night he read newspapers and
the BiDle and talked with Guards Jones
and Miller until 1 o'clock, when he knelt
and prayed. He slept three hours. At 8
o'clock he ate a hearty breakfast of ham
and eggs, potatoes, bread and coffee. The
execution ' was set for 10 o'clocu, but
"Warden Hale extended his life tenure fif
teen minutes, so that he could spend it
with Priests Legen and Conley.
Miller, very pale and trembling slightly,
ascended the gallows stairs leaning on the
arm of Father Legen. While i he black
cap was being adjusted Father Leeen said
for Miller that he "is not more guilty than
others who had not to suffer the death
penalty. He was not a Catholic or a fol
lower of any faith before yesterday, but
he died in the Catholic faith."
Then there was a click of the trap and
MiU'er hung at the eva of the rope. He
dropped five and a half feet. In fourteen
ruiautes Official Physicians Wickman,
Jones and Mattner pronounced him dead.
MilleT was a widower without children or
friends, and he will be buried in the prison
grounds to-morrow.
When Warden Hale read the death-war
raut to Miller he reiterated his innocence.
He left with Father Conley a long state
ment, detailing his connection with the
crime, laying the blame on his partner,
Stewart Green, who is in the prison serv
ing, a l\ie sentence, and claiming that
Green drugged him in whisky.
On Thursday morning. May 2, 1395, the
yeojle of Marysville were apprised of
the murder of Julius Pier, an
a>:e.4oaanof unsavory reputation with the
local, police in that he operated a "fence."
".Did .P;er had a friend in a colored street
car" stable hostler near by, and they bad
Viee'ii. in the habit ol exchanging parts of
-el:-cooked meals. On the morning
of ih.e. murder, and after repeated calls at
fc>ld.-..Pier'B place, Kinjr, the hostler, lorced
. an-.e'ntrance through a rear door and found
the Jpid man bound and gagged, lying in a
pcSol Of. blood in his small bedroom. Kmg
hastened to the police office, and soon
Mykrishul Maben and his othcers were at
.tiie.-sofne.
Evidences of a severe tussel and a few
mihbr discoveries put them in possession
of ai:clew. Shortly afterward a shirt was
foujid in an outhouse and it was recog
nized as tne property ot a young electri
cran. who haa been uoing under the name
oi Gfeorge Duroy. Duroy was placed un
der surveillance and it was learned that
he had confided the crime to a woman of
the town and had tried to procure money
enuugh to get away. He was arrested and
with iittle hesitation confessed, impli
cating Marshall J. Miller, a barber, 45
yeajs old, then conducting a shop on Sec
ond street.
Miller was placed under arrest and be
tween the two the details of this crime
and' of,' several projected ones, including
the murder of two or three wealthy mer
chants, the robbery of a bank and the kill
ing Â£>t one or more men at Dobbins ranch
and-Bullards Bar for purposes of robbery,
were reveaied.
E ich tried to shift the responsibility for
the Puer murder and its actual execution
o-p'on the other. How they had gagged
and. finally beaten to death the old man
was related, and the poople generally be
lieve- the actual killing was done by tho
young man.
The 'name Duroy proved to be an alias
for Stuatt Greene, the renegade son of Illi
..'nqis parents. His father came here and
ens ploying attorneys made a strong fight
t6i his life, and after months of work and
weeks of trial secured a verdict giving
â¢ hfm life imprisonment. Miller pleaded
guilty, was afterward denied a trial and
â  the case against him has pended in vari
ous.forms for a year and a half. His at
torrreys enlisted much sympathy for him
from people who believed that young
Gieen.e should have been hanged. With
that support they have tried in vain to
save his neck.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1896.
JOHNSON BESTED
BY VAN BUSKIRK
The Olympic Heavy-weight
Wins in the Fourth
Round.
Superior Weight Tells Against
the Sacramento Club's
Boxer.
Puts Up a Game Fight, but Soon
Succumbs to His Opponent's
Rustics.
SACRAMENTO Cal., Dec. 11.â The
heavy-weight champion of the Olympics,
Theodore Van Buskirk, added another
notch to the handle of his scalping-knife
after his battle with William Johnson,
the. pet of the Sacramento Athletic Club,
to-night. Van Buskirk won in the fourth
round. The fight was witnessed by over
2000 people and considerable money
changed hands on the result. Imme
diately preceding the mill odds were on
the Marysville lad.
Van Buskirk was the first to put in an
appearance and vaulted lightly over the
ropes into the ring. He was followed by
his trainer, Charles Hennessey, and his
seconds, Tom Johnson of Marysville and
John Norton of Sacramento. When
Johnson entered the hall rocKed with the
storm of applause which greeted him.
He was followet by his trainer, Henry
Peppers, und his seconds, J. C. Stelzner
and Ed Johnson. The men were called to
the center of the ring by Referee Thomas
Dwyer, who explained such blows as
would be considered foul, and assured
them that if his instructions were fol
lowed a perfectly fair and unbiased de
cision would be given. Dwyer played no
favorites, and in the fourth round, when
Johnson failed to regain his f et after
being floored by a left hand swing back of
the ear, he declared Van Buskirk the
winner.
When the men appeared in the ring it
was evident that Johnson was outweighed
by thirty pounds. In the first two rounds
his superior science was evident. He was
quick to take advantage of an opening
and his blows reached their mark. It was
not until the latter part of the third round
that Van displayed his rushing qualities.
His superior weight began to tell, and
Johnson was repeatedly forced from his
feet by the rushes of his opponent.
Round IâJohnson1 â Johnson landed a left on the jaw
and repeated it a moment later, receiving a
stiff punch on the wind in return. Johnson
again caught Van with a right on the jaw.
Van ducked a deft swing. Vau led wildly with
the right and they cauoned. Johnson landed
left ou the neck and followed it with a right
over the heart. Van again swung wildly and
a clinch followed his lailure to laud.
Round 2â Van landed a right over the heart
and they clinched. Van iound Johnson's jaw
and rapid in-tighti..g followed. Johnson's I
left found Van's neck. Van countered on the
body and they clinched. Van led with his I
right and missed, and was countered heavily j
ou the jaw. His next lead was countered ou i
the ribs. Johnson landed a left smash on the
face as the going sounded.
Round 3â Van reached Johnson's wind with !
his left. Johnson' landed a right over the
heart. Van rushed him and carried him eft
his feet. Johnson landed a heavy uppercut
on Van's ribs. Van's left cauehi Johnson on
the heart. Johnson countered on Van's face.
Van rushed and floored Johnson with a ri^ht
sw.ng. When he regained his feet Van rushed
him against the ropes. They clinched and
Johnson lell. Jonnson came back gamely and
tapped Van's face Van again rushed him off
his feet. Johnson came up grotfgy.
Round 4 â The round opened with a clinch.
On the break Van rushed Johnson and floored
him. Johnson came up very groggy and was
at Van's mercy. The Olympic lad landed a
heavy right swing under the ear, knocking
Johnson down a/id out.
The opening event between W. L. Henly
and J. C. Conway, in the 125-pound class,
was one of the cleverest exhibitions of
boxing witnessed in the clubrooms for
years. Honors were easy at the close.
The seoofd preliminary bout, between
Edear Johnson and William McGraw, was
clearly in favor of Johnson, although Mc-
Graw, who has been the club's champion
in that class for the past two years, mad- 1
it exceedingly interesting for his oppo
nent at times. The third bout was a neat
exhibition between L. A. Payne and Wil
lisrn Donohne, Doth of the local club. The
nen were entered in the 148-pound class
and honors broke even.
FOR A MODERATE MEASURE.
All Interests to He Cotmldered in the Sew
Tariff Hill.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 11. â A
moderate measure is the characterization
which leading Republicans of the House
give to the new tariff bill which it is pro
posed to frame this winter in anticipation
of an extra ?pss!on of Congress. It is ex
plained that what is desired is a bill which
will provide a sufficient revenue to cover
the deficit now existing, furnishing proper
protection to home industries, and also
that conditions have changed since what
is known as the McKinlev bill became a
law, and ilrat rates of duty that were justi
fied then are unnecessary at present. The
s^ugar schedule promises to cause more
embarrassment than any other in the bill.
The agriculture schedule will probably be
fixed at the former rate of duty, while the
woolen schedule, it is said, will receive a
sufficient protection to satisfy the manu
facturers. The cotton and steel and iron
schedules are now likely to be changed.
The â¢ bill, it is said, "will contain a pro
vision tliat goods in bond will, when
taken out, pay the rate of duty in force
and not the lower rate at which they were
originally brought to this country.
An arrangement will be. made whereby
dates will be assigned to certain interests
to be heard, so that there may be some
systematic method of "giving the hearings
without embarrassment. The date upon
which the hearings will begin will be
made public when the full committee
meets.

great strss upon the statements that Mr.

Canadian policy in tne direction of pro

out ot cereal production in England for
Â£130,000,000 worth of imports, the
most of which could be produced. He
â¢was in favor of a duty of 5 per cent on

DARKNESS FLYING
BEFORE ARC LIGHTS
Era of General Improve
ments Along the
Line.
Business Men and Residents
With One Impetus Join
tbe Movement.
Powell Street to Eclipse All Others
by the Novelty of Its
Attraction.
Powell-street Improvement Club intends

ing night into day by a display of electric
arc lights, not only on the leading street
for which the club has been formed, but
on the cross streets leading into it.

are raised to warrant the association in
making a contract the lights are ordered
installed.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hleh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usjiallv preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rain*
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. Whin the pressure is high In the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
' NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 11.â R. G. Dun A Co.
will say to-morrow in their weekly review of trade:
The approach of the holidays and 4 doubt about the
action of'Congrest put farther Improvements off
until the new year. While industries have gained
in working forces they are waiting for commen
surate gain In demand, and meanwhile are trying to
Clear away embarrassments' which restrict them.
1 Speculation has been halting atni tlmii. There. Is
no sober-mind>d fear of, foreign difficulty, but
some have succeeded In Imagining that Congress
might co so tar beyond the President's prudent
message regarding Cuba as to embroil this coun
try with Spain. . - ...
Money in In abundant supply, lending in London
continuous, and there Is nothing to cause less
activity In general business except that ihe rush
of orders deferred until after election have not
been, continued. ihe vo ume of business shown
by clearings has been for the week 5.2 per cent
smaller than las: year. Scanty returns of rallrvml
earnings tor December embrace so bad a report of
St. Paul that they fell 16 4 per cent below those of
1892. Earnlnrs on United States roads, which
amounted to $37,626,266 in November, were 10.9
per. cent 'less than last year and 12.2 less than In

WOUL-The iirc:ilar of JÂ«cob Wo'lner nays:
â¢â¢Thern is very little to report in regard to our
Wool market. Althouzh there are about 6.000.0U0
lbs Wool in warehouse here, thore Is very IKtle
selling ana very little luqulrr. There seems to be
no demand con ins irom the East, and Kawttrn
markets are reported quiet. Price* are held firm,
but oniv nominally, as there a ems to be 110 de
mand, in fact since the election we have had a
very quiet market and very little Wool has been
gold. London Wool sales, which opened the 22il
ult. and will close to-morrow. 11th ins;., were re
ported very active with a good atlendauoe and
wl.h an adva-ice f.om 6 to 10% over the last sales
In r. Amem an buyers cut quite a figure
until the lH3t few days, when prices receiipd to
about opening prices with a very quiet demand.
The who c question about Wool now Is the t->rlff.
as our domestic Wo* Is are quite up In prices 10
I foreign Woois. European woolen-mills are renort-
I ed nc;l ely employed, but our domestic wooien
mills can get but lew orders and that Is what Is re
lurdlng t^e demon I for Wool. If there Is nothing
done In thlss?ssion of Congress wltn the Dinsley
bi 1 and we have to wait for an extra session for a
general tariff bill to pass. It will hold hard with
the Wool trade, as we lire bound to be flooded v i : U
foreign Wool and manufactured goods. Our stocks
on hand ure a gooJ <1. al larger than they were a
yenr ugo at, this time, even prices asked are 3@'-c
ft lb less than they were last year at this time "

Marshall Heirs Seek to
Recover a Mission San
Jose Estate.
Now in the Possession ot a Man
Whom the o\d Pioneer
Beirienfod.
Suit Based en a Prcm se Made to a
Father When on His
Deathbed.
â¢ Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 11. j
Few stories tind their way into the Su
â¢ preme Court which equal in general inter
eat the historic tale told in an appeal in
' in the case of the Marshall estate of Mis
. Bion San Jose.
: Dr. R. L. Marshall of Oakland promised
his father on his deathbed that he would
â  do everything in his power to see that the
" estate of the old pioneer went to the
- rightful heirs. The suit was once filed in
Aiamedti County, but was dismissed with
out prejudice on account of the alleged
(liilatoriness of the prosecution. The ap
peal is taken on the ground that the wit
nesses cobld not be found, and that all
due diligence was shown by the heirs.
Earl Marshall was born in 1799, and
came round the Horn in the old ship
Brooklyn in 1847. He at once located al
Mission San Jose and embarked in thÂ«
dairy business. In 1828 Earl married Le
titiu Dorsev, but the couple had no issue
. In the year of Marshall's arrival - then
came to the new colony Sam Brannan and
some Mormon followers, and .in about
1866 it is claimed that Marshall became 1
convert to the Mormon religion, anc
throughout his life remained subject tc
â¢ the influence of the Mormon doctrine.
".- About the year 1828 Earl Marshall tool
tinder his care a child named Simeor
Stivers, who was then about three yean
of age, and kept him till he arrived at the
age of manhood. In December, 1865
Marshall conveyed to Stivers one-half o
all his real property and the two then
became partners in the farming business.
Little by little Marshall became more
feeble and infirm, until finally be was sc
incapable that he required some person tc
dress and feed him, and this was done by
Stivers.
Dr. Marshall, who is now striving tc
.fulfill his promise to his dead father,
asserts that about 1877 Stivers commenced
u> convert to his own use.the share of his
partner, Earl Marshall, and has continued
to take the rents and profits of the prem
ises up to the present time.
The basis of the complaint is an alle
gation relating to James W. Gillan, a
Mormon elder and preacner. By reason
of the religious fellowship existing be
tween Gillan and Marshall, and because
of the age and infirmity and childishness
of the old pioneer farmer, Gillan, it is
said, gained great influence over the old
man. . '
â¢:â ' About a year after the arrival of the
Mormon elÂ»ier it is alleged that Gil Jan and
frtivers conspired together ;o take jidvan
â¢ Â«^ts t,i 3aar*Â±snii-ani! induce him to make
a deed to James W. Gillan of his (Mar
shall's hall of the premises.' According to
, !his deed Marshall was paid $6000, but it
is now alleged that he received nothing
and that the wbcie transaction was fraud
ulent. â  On the same day Gillan delivered
to Stivers his deed, which purported to
' convey to Stivers half of the premises just
mentioned. ,
After these transactions, it is charged.
Stiver?, in order to deceive Marshall as to
the true nature of such transaction,
deeded the half interest to Earl Marshall
and Letitia, his wife, for the terra of their
natural lives, but the plaintiff alleges that
there was ; no consideration given, and
that the old farmer and bis wife were
not aware of the true nature of the deal. '
The old pioneer died without leaving a
will in 1881. From 1860 it is asserted that
Letitia Marshall was crazy and totally in
capacitated, and there.'ore couid not'be a
ltg;ii party to any transfer. On these
facts Dr. Marshall st^eks to recover the es
tate from Mr. Stivers, who is a highly re
spected citizen of Mission San Jose, for
the heirs of old Earl Marshall. -
For over three years the greatest inter
est has been shown in the Marshall-Sti
vers property in the Mission. It is now
very valuable, and one of the most profit
able sections in that part of the County.
Officially it is known as tract 64 on the
purvey and plat of the ex-Mission San
'Jose. _â_____Â«^__
JOHNSON WAS WINGED,

Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 11. f
Back of the arrest of John Johnson, a
young Done who was taken into custody
by the police on Wednesday last on a
charge of disturbing the peace, is a story
ol love and a thrilling scene that those
most interested have been trying very
hard to keep quiet.
Johnson was employed at the handsome
Kimbaii home on Thirteenth and Madison
streets as a gardener. In the same resi
dence Miss Isabella Johnson, a Swedish
girl, filled the position of housekeeper.
Mist John-on was no relative of tiie
gardener, and being comely, John's heart
went out to her and be proceeded to cast
sheep's eyes at her in the most approved
fashion. As far as can be learned, Miss
Johnson discountenanced John's ad
vances and he made little headway with i
his wooing.
Finally, through payine more attention
to the housekeeper's movements than to
his flowers John was discharged and re
moved from the Sight of his charmer.
His ardor was not cooled, however, and
he hung about die place, and when un
able to seethe fair Isabella sent her ten
der missives and a picture of bimsell| to
remwid her that his heart was true.
'lhe-e actions finally so incensed the
housekeeper that she told him to begone
and show his f<;ce no more.
Then John concluded that it was time
to quit, but nho felt that it would be well
I 10 get his leiteis and the picture back. He
1 rould not get the articles by calling on
\ Miss Johnson, for she refused to see him,
;-o he decided on another tack.
One evening when the family was out
he male his way into the house and Miss
Johnson's room, and after securing his
love-letters started out again.
As he reached the lront ol the residence
the daughters of the house confronted
him, and taking him for a burglar began

no other way of escape Johnson made for
a fence surrounding the property and was
just disappearing from sight when Schu
man made a pun play and sent a bullet in
Johnson's direction.
He did not appear to be hit and all sup

He showed a bullet wound in his shonl
der as evidence that he was hit by Scha

Stenzler to have the wound dressed and
the gardener then returned to Oakland,
where he was captured by the police.
He declares that he still loves Miss
Johnson and that he only went into the
house to secure the letters that she
j scorned to answer. He declares also that
he will never bother her again for fear of
a more dangerous wound.

Operator Hammond Ended an Unhappy
. ' â¢ liife by Taking Poison. 1 , . t
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 11.â 0. E. Ham
mond, ,an operator . for the- Associated
Presses, died early this morning "as' the
result of a doss of poison. He was drink
ing last night and seemed to be well sup
plied with money. His last drink was
sodawater, after taking (which he fell back
as though in a faintingfit. He was at
once taken to the Receiving Hospital and
the dector pronounced it a case of mor
phine poisoning.
Hammond had a wife and five children
living in Alameda. A letter from his wife
was found in his pocket, which plainly
showed that he was spending in dissipa
tion what should have gone for his wife
and children. --_-/-_
One paragraph explains the rest. It
says: "If I should write what I have
thoueh,t for the past ten days you would
not care to read it. It is hard to be an ob
ject of charity when we ought to have
plenty and to spare. I have paid out
every cent I had, expecting more, of
course. Bena came over and found me
crying. We were out of fuel and two pay
days had gone by and not even a word,
and I had promised to pay for the gro
ceries and could not. -
"The rent collector has been here twice
and all the other bills were going on. I
will try to do my part, but there is one
thing you ought to do. After we get
down there you should give me the salary
each week and Jet me try to pay as we go
along and keep out of debt. I diii not
show the children the letter. They asked
to read it, but I burned it and made an
excuse to them that I had put it away
somewhere."
The pitiful story was told at the inquest
held to-night.

908 Broadway, Dec. 1L j
Fraternal circles in this city are watch
ing with great interest the trial of Wil
liam Young of Fountain Lodge of Odd
Fellows for alleged violation of friendship,
love and truth.
William Youngr and Steuart A. Puckett
are prominent members of the order, and
in the case now before the fraternal court
Fuckett is the prosecuting witness. He
charges Young with breaking up his homp,
when he should have done all he could to
preserve its sanctity.
W r hen the Alaskan gold fever broke out
in Oakland last spring Fuckett decided to
run the risk of making a fortune or
nothing in the north. He was doing
fairly well in this city, but prospects were
not so bright here as he expected in
Alaska, so he went north with one of the
parties that went from Oakland.
.Before going he saw that his young wife
was comfortaole with her parents, and he
corresponded regularly. Being an Odd
Fellow he told his brethren of his inten
tention, aud this information is consid
ered equal to placing a wife under the fra-'
ternal care of the lodge.
When Pucfcett returned he found that
his wife's affections had been alienated,
and he had no difficulty in discovering
that Young was the disturbing element.
HU wife declined to return to her husband
and written charges were made to the
lodge, which are now nnder investigation.
Attorney Johns champions the cause of
Puckeit and Major Whitney is looking
after the interests of Young.
The defendant is placed in a very un
happy position. He does not deny that
there is trouble in the Puckett family, but
he will no. i admit that the fault is his.
His only escape seems to ne to blame the
lady in the caÂ«e for preferring his atten
tentions to those of her husband, and this
he does not care to do. When the lodge
has concluded it labors the Case will go to
the divorce court.
Six years ago Steuart Puckett and Mis 3
Tischwre lovers. The young lady was
not then 17, and although her lover coun
seled seeking her parents' consent, she
wanted things her own way, so a little
trip ouiside the Heads and a tugboat mar
riage were decided upon and carried out.
The jroung couple lived together happily
until P'.ickeu made his trip to Alaska.
Many witnesses have been on the stand
before the fraternal jury, and a verdict is

CALIFORNIA AT HAMBURG.
H. O. Trowbridge of Oakland Cboion
to Represent the State* Interests
at the Big Fair.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 11. (
H. O. Trowbndge of this city, one of the
leading organizers ot the Oakland Exposi
tion, received word to-day from the State
Board of Trade that he had been unani
mously selected as its representative to
the Hamburg Exposition of 1897. The
State Board will also mate an effort to
have Governor Budd appoint Mr. Trow
bridge as Commissioner from this State.
Twice during tne past five years Mr.
Trowbridge has been in Germany and is
well acquainted with the conditions of
American trade at Hamburg. He is par
ticularly gratified at his appointment, and
is confident that the exposition can be
made to prove of great service to Califor
nia.
"This is a most important exposition
for California," said Mr. Trowbridge to
day. "It is purely a horticultural exhibit,
and it is at such a time that this State has
her best opportunity. The wine product,
olive oil and everything that the orchard
can produce will be represented, and ii is
in these lines that California makes her
boast, and much will be expected of her.
There are several reasons why this great
opportunity -hoiuit not be lost. In the
first place, Hamburg is the second mari
time city of the world. Two years ngo
Liverpool led, but now it does not do so
any longer. Hamburg is the great dis
tributing port for the whole of Northwest
Europe. 1 am intimately acquainted with
the situation of trade at thai place, and I
feel confident that California fruit, e-pe
cially dried and canned fruits, wines and
olive oil, only need to be properly brought
before that part of the world to insure a
lucrative market. I conscientiously be
lieve that with intelligent introduction

not less than one-half of the supply of the
product, of this State could find a market
with Hamburg as a distributing center."

-'' HEW TO-DAT:
A SLIGHT MISTAKE.
The Eyes Sometimes Deceive.
There are a number of experiences in
real life from which interesting experi-
ences can be gathered. The treasurer of a
large manufacturing concern, whose
name need not be given for the purpose of
this article, has been compelled to give up
drinking coffee on account of its effect on
his stomach and nervous system. .
It was suggested that: he try the health
coffee "Postum Cereal," as that is made of
the healthful grains and takes the place of
coffee very nicely. , Ââ .:â â 
He rather felt that it was a foolish step
to undertake to use any article with the
expectation that it would take the place
of coffee which his family used of the bost
grade; of Mocha and; Java ; mixed. g How-
ever, a package was oidered for the house
and the next morning at breakfast the
coffee. pot came on as usual. When the
beverage was poured out and served to
him he told the | servant that he " had or-
dered some Postnm, a new drink, and did
not care for the coffee.
I A laugh went round the. table and he
declined to i believe that the rich liquid
with the aroma and fragrance that reached
his nostrils was the health coffee. Inves-
tigation, however, convinced him of the
fact, and its uÂ»e day by day without the
old sick feeling clinches the argument.
I'ostum is "made . by the Postum Cereal
Co. (Limited), of Battle Creek; Mich.,
and i has a : winning way of ' its ; own.
When \ once i introduced Into the family it
answers every purpose of the finest coffee
without- the* attendant t: aches'? and : ills.
Being composed strictly and wholly of the
pure cereals there is no question or, argu-
ment or possible doubt regarding j the
healthfuL and nourishing 3 properties, for.
children as well as adults.
There is but one genuine original Postum
Cereal coffee, with a multitude ,of imita-
tions offered as "just as good." Â â â ''sjXtW'i

is a disease which afflicts over 75 per
cent. â¢of the American people. It is a
dangerous disease because it not only,
poisons the blood but causes heaviness,
oppression, and dulls the intellect. Then
follow chronic headache, loss of appe-
tite, slow digestion, nervousness, bad
breath, dingy complexion: and low
spirits. It will eventually bring on
- liver and kidney disease in some incur- f
: able form. But sufferers from this

JUST AN ECHO
FROM MONTANA
Trainer Randall Sends Two
Warm Ones to the
Post.
Hardtack II From England and
Ostler Joe M:re Than
Looked In.
The Odis Were Tco Short for Red
Glennâ Personne Was Quite Fast
for a Moidea.
â¢ Possibly the people of Montana do not
raise mushrooms on the tops of their
mountains nor eat ripe, meilowy peaches
at Christmas time, but they do send down
some horses here that win at very juicy
prices, and just when the general betting j
public think they are outclassed. Entered |
in the second event at Ingleside yesterday
was a horse registered under the name of j
imp. Hardtack in England. Now, it I
might just as we.l have been imported j
biscuit in Ireland for all the general pub- j
lie knew about him, but he got out and :
won a "city block, 1 ' reeling off seven fur- I
longs in l:30U. In the mile and a quarter i
selling affair "Billy" Randall, who trains i
these Montana enigmas, had the black 1
horse Ostler Joe. The talent thought he
could not go the route and so did the
oracles who make books in the ring.
Seven to one was laid auainst him, and
he didn't do a thing but buck-jump in. j
setting the track record for that distance
at 2:08) 4, a chop of two seconds. Mr. Ran- ;
dall smiled in* bis' usual calm way and
will attend an opening of one of the City
savines banks this morning.
It tried to rain hard during the after
noon, but Secretary bam Leake spoke a '
few magic words and the trade remained
as dry as an Arizona miner after a coyote i
bunt. The crowd was large and the name [
was a bit uncertain, some very warm j
choices being hung on the peg. CaManan
and Personne alone ran to expectations,
closing warm favorites.
The first race was for maidens, over
seven furlongs, and Louis Ezell's two
year-old colt Personne, backed from 5 to 2 j
to 9 to 10, won romping from Sir Andrew, j
al2to 1 chance. Tue winner's last race !
was not one to exult over, but it simply i
marks the uncertainties of racing.
The race fallowing was a second division i
of the opening event, also for maidens.
Lupula and The Tourist were sort of sub
dued, weak choice?, but Hardtack 11, j
played down from 25 to 12 to 1, fairly !
spread-eagled his field, winning by eight I
lengths from Rebekali. an 8 to 1 shot, i
Manzanillo was a eood third.
Trainer "Sandy" McNaughton thought |
Semper Lex a "pipe" for the mile and a i
quarter selling affray and the big chest- i
nut closed.a 3to 2 favorite in tue betting.
Ostler Joe took the"lead from the second j
choice, Rey del Bandidos, after passing j
the stand and the black horse thereafter i
made all the runninc and was by himself, j
with Adolph Spreckels a good second, half i
a length in lront of the favorite. The
winner carried 69 pounds and will take]
considerable beating over a distance ofi
ground. !
Of course there was nothing to the mile j
dash that came next but Red Glenn, and j
the books quoted the gelding at 1 to 4. He 'â 
showed and that was all. Bob Isoin !
hustled the Spreckels entry, Lucille, along j
in the stretch, and the mare finished a !
neck before Walter Jat the wire. The '
winner was 25 to lin the betting. Red â 
Glenn showed speed for half the journey, '
and not liking the odd?, anyway, refused ,
to try longer. Ha is one of the wisest j
horses now running on the turf.
Sam Hildreth goes astray at times, but I
when he said Caesarian was a "moral" for I
the final race of the day at six furlongs, he 1
was quite right. The sprinter won in a
gallop from Major Cook, starting a 7 to 10 I
choice. Toano, poorly ridden by Willie j
Martin, was a good third.
'âââ¦
Notes.
Ingleside track closes its two weeks' '
meeting to-day with one of the finest cards
yet offered the race-going public. Al- i
though the $1300 Palace Hotel stake is the !
feature of the programme it is hardly a !
marker for the mile handicap with such :
horses as Captive, Libertine, Summer
time and Howard S starting. The weights :
seem beautifully adjusted and a great race
should result.

YOUNG CRIMINALS.
With the Grace of Childhood on Their
Cheeks They Answer "Guilty."
Thirteen young men were huddled to
gether in the prisoner's dock in Judge
Wallace's court yesterday morning. Not
one of the miserable rabble looked to be
25 years of age, only a few were able to
muster enough down upon their upper
lips to say that they really had mustaches,
while three of the prisoners were so young
that their cheeks still bore the grace of
childhood and in their- eyes shone the
hungry light of longine homesickness
that touched the hearts of all beholders.
Some are nomelessand friendless, while
others are still more unfortunate in the
possession of reckless and unworthy pa
rents.
The police authorities are known to
hold theso children to be hardened crimi
nals, and it is deemed best that they be
isolated and deprived of their liberty in
the interest ot the community.
Th 4 majority of the youngsters stand
charged with burglary, that appearing to
be the favored form of crime among the
boys who are allowed to run wild on the
streets of tnis City.
When called to plead, two of the young
sters said they were willing to confess
their guilt, and Judge Wallace said it
would be so entered, though the court
would appoint attorneys to represent the
defendants and would give them permis
sion to withdraw their plea of guilty at
any time within ten days if advised so to
do.
The police authorities, as well as the
prosecuting officials of the criminal courts,
are much exercised over the prevalence of
such crime among young boys in this City
and would welcome any movement that
would better ttie condition of these chil
dren, who at present are regarded as un
fortunate candidates for the State prison
and the gallows.

UNION LEAGUE CLUB.
Robert A. Friedrich Will Probably Be
Named for President.
The committee appointed to nominate
the regular ticket for the approaching elec
tion of the Union League Club will hold a
session to-day. From the gossip going
around it appears that General Robert A.
Friedrich will be designated as the candi
date for president on the regular ticket,
and the present indications are that his
nomination will not develop an opposition
candidate. If any battle at all be fought
this year it will be waged around the sec
retaryship. There is a good deal of quiet
talk in club circles ot contest on this
ground, and if one aspirant in particular
should get the regular nomination opposi
tion would instantly develop.
The club is in a prosperous condition
and conitantlv expanding. Many of the
members are in favor of new quarters with
increased accommodations.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1896.
OPPOSE PRISON
DIRECTORS' PLAN
Manufacturers Want no
More Convict Goods
Made.
A Eig Experimental California
Cigar- Factory Contem
plated.
If It Prove Success. ul Havana Cigars
Will Sell at Sixty Dollars a
Thousand.
The Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation placed itself on retorti yesterday
as in emphatic opposition to California
State convict manufactures except in the
making of jute bags and the cracking of
stone from prison quarries for use on pub
lic highways. It also approved of a con
vict labor bill, a peddler's license bill and
a State supplies bill, all of which it in
dorsed and ordered forwarded immedi
ately to the Code Commissioners to show
the sentiment on the subjects treated.
During the meeting Sam K. Thornton
was introduced and addressed tie board
upon the advantages and the encourage
ment that should be accorded the culture
of tobacco in California. In part he uud:
"The culture ol tobacco and manufac
ture of cigars can be made one of the most
important industries of the State.
"The tobacco now grown at Sati Felipe,
Santa Clara County, is superior to any in
the United Stales and superior to that uf
Cuba.
"We are seeking to interest capital in
the manufacture of cigars, ana our propo
sition is to secure ten men who will put
up $200 eachâ s2ooo In allâ to start an ex
perimental cisar-factory to be run four
months, at th- end of which time if it is
proven that the industry can be run profit
ably more capital will be secured. We
have now on hand 25,000 pounds of the
crop of 1804 and 25,000 pounds of the 1895
crop that in ready to bo manufactured into
cigars. The cigars can be made at an act
ual cost oi $35 a thousand. They are be
ing now sold at $75, but it ia our purpose
to sell them at $60.
"The crop of 1892 93 was sold in New
York and the cigars sent out here and sold
as the genuine Havana leaf."
A meeting will be held by those inter
ested Monday next at 3 p. M. at the rooms
of the State Board of Trade.
The association also indorsed a bill to
the Stale Legislature "to regulate the pro
fession and provide for the registration of
public accountants.' 1 Such accountant!*,
according to the regulations of the bill,
must regularly quality before a commit cc
ol the Board of Regents of the University
of California to be permitted to engage in
the particular profession indicated. In
other words they must prove their fitness
before they can engage in the. profession
of expert accounting.
The board appointed as permanent dele
gates to the recently named Council of
Associated Industries, Messrs. Mead,
Keller and Kerr, who shall represent the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion in thnt body.
Frank Zau of Zan Bros. & Co., brocm
niakers of this City, appeared before the
board and asked permission to send to the
Legislature through the Manufacturers'
and Producrs' Association two bills for
the broom-making industry here. He had
not yet framed tbe bills, but will soon
present them to the r.ssociation. They
practically strike at the broom-making
business in the State Asylum lor the adult
Lima where, because the institution is
maintained by the public, brooms can be
made so cheap that the ordinary home
manufacturer cannot compete In this
market.
The resolution against Ihe contemplated
I increase in the list of convict-made good.-,
! as intimated in the recent recommenda
i tion of the Board of Stale P. ison Direct
! ors to Governor Budd, was offered by Ju
j Han Sonntag, and copies will be sent to all
I labor organizations to enlist their co-oper
ation. The resolution in part is as fol
lows:
Jfciohrd,' That the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association of California are unalter
ably opposed to the employment ol convicts
within the State prisons ot California, other
than in the manufacture of ju:e bugs and the
breaking of stones taken from quarry upon
prison grounds for the use of public roads and
highways; that as mi association we will use
all honorable means to defeat any bul or incus
ure which may be presented by the Honorable
Board of State Prison Directors to the Legisla
ture of California which will give employment
to convicts, other than the two herein named.

The Beaver Hill Coal Company's Steamer Czarina as She Appeared on Her Trial Trip in Mission Bay Yesterday. "Without Any Preparation She Made JO 1-2 Knots
an Hour Over the Measured Mile and Surprised the Men Who Made the Repairs*
SUCCESSFUL TRIAL
OF THE CZARINA
A New Record for Colliers
Made by the Renovated
Steamer.
She Will Run in the Beaver Hill
Coal Trade, Beginning Next
Week.
On Her Arrival the Mariposa Will Be
Laid Up for a General Over
hauling.
The Beaver Hill Coal Company's Czar
ina had her trial trip yesterday. She
more than exceeded expectations and in
consequence the directors of the Kisdon
Iron Works are jubilant. When the
steamer reached San Francisco in tow of
the tug Fearless her engine-room was to
all intents and purposes a wreck. Since
then the vessel has teen thoroughly over
hauled and yesterday o?er the measured
mile she logged better than 10 34 knots an
hour. When she is fitted with the patent
corrugated propeller Captain Drisko ex
pects his vessel to beat 11 knots when
fully loaded.
Among the guests who went out to see
what the Czarina could do on her trial
were R. S. Moore, vice-president of the
Risdon Iron Works; H. U Tabrett, marine
superintendent of the Risdon Iron Works;
Manasrer Graham and Assistant Manager
Stafford of the Beaver Hii: Coal Com
pany and Captain Higgins of the steam
tchooner line. Over the measured mile
the Czurina made splendid time and then
Captain Drisko headed her Icr the Golden
Gate. The vessel was living light and in
consequence she rolled heavily when the
tide-rip struck her.
JJsually Moore and Graham are good
sailor.-, "out yesterday they paid their
tribute to Neptune. With his left hand
clutching the rail and his head over the
side Moore waved frantically to Captain
Drisko with his right to put the ship
about. The order was obeyed, and half
an hour later Mr. Moore was on terra
firm a.
Evervboiy connected with the vessel
was more than satisfied with the trial. "It
was the three hundred and twentieth test
of a steamer that I have been out on,"
said Superintendent Tabrett yesterday,
"and I never saw a boat move off so
quietly and do such eood work without
the engines having been turned over be
forehand as the Czarina. The credit of
the performance is due in a great measure
to Martin Buiger, the expert on marine
engines, as he superintended all the re
pairs. He was unable to be present at the
trial trip owing to an attack ol rhenina
tism."
Directly the trial trip was over the
Czarina was docked and the worn of ship
ping cargo begun. She may get away for
the mines to-day, but the chances are that
Monday will still see her at her does load
ing cargo.
Sardines and herrings are at a discount
at Fishermen's wharf. Latterly the
catches have been unusually heavy, and
as the demand is slight the Italians do
not know what to do with their catch.
Yesterday a 50 or 60 pound box of
the fish could be bought for 25 cents, and
the fishermen were qiad to get rid of them
at that figure. The run is unusually
heavy this year, and every boat that
comes in is loaded down with the fish.
The coalheavers on the Richard 111 had
a mtrrow escape yesterday. The vessel
was discnarging at Roienfeld's bunkers,
and as one of the b.ickets was being
hoisted out of the hold it tipped and
threw the couple of tons of coal back into
the hold. Several of the men had a nar
row escape, and they not only thanKed
their lucky stars, but shook their fists at
the man aloft who was manipulating the I
buckets.
The steamer Mariposa will be due here
next Thursday and she will be laid uj> for
repairs. Her boilers want overhauling
and consequently the bunkers will have
to be emptied. This will take some time,
and, coupled with the work that will have
to be done in tlie boiier-ioom, it will be
impossible to get the ve-sel ready lor sea
on her sailing date. The Zealandia has
therefore been called out i,f retirement
and will take up the Mariposa's run. She
has just comclete:! a voyage to Central
America for the Pacific Mail Company, but

before tying her up at Martinez Captain
Howard saw 10 it that she was in first
class order. Under his viarilant eye every
little repair necessary was made, and in
consequence the Zealandia will go out
with every department in perfect working
order. She is a sister ship to the Australia
and f hould make good time between here
and Australia.
"Where is the schooner Lotus?" That
is the question that is troubling
Captain Pearson. Last Wtdnesday he
left the little craft tied up at Howard
street wharf, and next morning when he
came back to the front the schooner was
sone and not a trace of her has been
found. During tbe night some one threw
off the mooring lines and silently sailed
away. Pearson is frantic over his loss, as
the little vessel was his "all in all" and
outside of her he has no means of earning
a livelihood. The Lotus was formerly a
sloop, but when Pearson bought her he
turned her into a schooner. She has been
engaged in trading around the bay, and
has several times been engaged by duck-*
hunters to go to the Suisun marshes. She
is well known from Vallejo to Alviso, and
every boatman on the water front would
recognize her a mile off. Nevertheless
she has disappeared as completely as
though she had been sunk to tbe bottom
of the bay.
The United States Fish Comnrssion
steamer Albatross arrived yesterday morn
ing at 10 o'clock from Bering Sea. where
she has been investigating the fur-seal
fishery in those waters. The vessel left
this port January 5, having on board
President Jordan of Stanford University,
as well as Naturalist N. B. Miller of
Washington, D. C.
By the barken tine Tropic Bird, which
arrived last evening from Papeeti, it is
learned that theNicarapuan brig Salvador
came into that port November 2, sixty
seven days from Astoria bound for Callao.
The vessel was leaking badly, having
been strained by the rough weather she
had encountered. Her deckload of lum
ber had been thrown overboard. She in
tended to make the needed repairs and
proceed on her voyage to Cillao, Peru.
The Norwegian bark Fabez, from Syd
ney, arrived in Papeete with a cargo of
hardwood logs. She was in distress, hav
ing encountered severe gales and high
seas.
A CENT FOR EACH YEAR.
The High School Girls Give a
Social for the Training-
Home.
A Unique Gradation of the Prices of
Admissionâ A Generous Sum
Raised.
The "middlers" of the Girls' High
School gave a merry reception and social
yesterday afternoon from 2 to 5 o'clock at
their big brick building, corner of Geary
and Scott streets. The young ladies very
practically made business the prime ob
ject of the affair and charged an admis
sion fee, the sum total of which was pre
sented to the California Girls' Trnining
Home, located at 147 Natoma street.
The method adopted was that each
guest should pay upon entrance a cent for
every year of his or her age. With the
boys the rates ranged from 23 to 25 cents.
A good many whoso appearance spoke of
callow youth were beyond tlie Jast "teen"
! milestone, but there was a monetary
virtue in the deception and it passed with
its owner an easy scrutiny.
With the girls the rate ran lower, stand
ing at 15. As the doorkeepers were of
that sex there was a strong disposition in
many cases to question the age of the fair
applicant for admission, but upon ma
turer reflection the calamity was averted.
The class officers of the "middlers" are
Miss Lillie E. McGill, president; Miss
Claire Gossip, vice-president; reception
committee â Miss Sadie Wangenheira,
Miss ivhei Buneman ; floor managers â
Mi?s Alice Jobson, Franc Milroy; com
mittee of arrangements â Camille Meyer,
Annet Benn?tt. During the reception
the following literary and musical pro
gramme was rendered:
Musical selec:ion, Miss E. Ross; recita
tion, Miss M. Muller; vocal solo, Miss I.
Wilhelm; piano selection, Miss G. Israel;
recitation, Miss J. Seavey; vocal solo. Miss
H. Lask; recitation, Miss L. Dow: music
by Randall's Hungarian orchestra. Re
freshments were served to the guests at
the close of the literary exercises.
The Gins' Training Home, for which the
reception and entertainment were held,
contains twenty. nine inmates under the
care of Mrs. L. B. Fischer. A short time
ago the senior class of the Girl?' High
School gave a reception for the benefit of
the institution wliich netted the borne
about $60.
Mrs. Fischer received permission from
the Board of Education to visit the city
schools and request the classes to get up
entertainments of some simple character
in the interest of the Home. The Girls'
High School is the first place Mrs. Fischer
has gone to for this donation and a .gen
erous sum for the Home is the result.
The girls> of the High School have prom
i-ed to maintain at their own expense
four rooms in the Home.
Sea Otter Furs.
United States District Judge Morrow yester
day gave a decision in the case of C. F. Kydell
aud a number of seamen of the steam
schooner Herman against the Pacific Trading
Company. The men shipped on a sea otter
hunting voyape and the catch was eighty
tive st'a otter furs. A Uiipute aro>e as to the
amount of money due the men, who were to
be paid nccordlng to tne market price of the
furs. The company lieid that the furs were
worth only $150 apiece, wniie the men con
tended that they should be paid on a basis of
$200 per pelt and that this figure was the cur
rent price. Judge Morrow sp.it the difference
and directed that each man be puid nis pro
portion of a lay of $170, which he held was
the market price.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1896.
F, W, DAVIS AND HIS
TWO YOUNG WIVES
Judge Hebbard's Lament
able Error Finally
Corrected.
Declared, by Default, the Annul
ment of a L>3gal
Marriage.
Shown That the Husband Was Over
18 Years of Ag; When Ha
Was First Wedded.
Judge Hebbani yesterday presented F.
W. Davis with one more wife than is usu
ally regarded as necessary for an ordinary
citizen. Mr. Davis was already living
with one pood woman in Santa Rosa,
and evidently did not wish to be burdened
with another, but the court did not think
that the young husband had legally freed
himself from his first matrimonial alliance
before entering into the second, and that
is why consternation reigns in the Davis
household.
Attorney W. W. Davidson, representing
Mrs. Mac Davis, the first wife, brought up
the record to show the following state of
facts: F.W.Davis and Mac Davis were
married in San Diego in September, 1894,
and went to Los Angeles, where be de
serted her a few weeks later. She was in
destitute circumstances, and was be
friended by the ladies of the Women's
Christian Temperance Union and was as
sisted in her desire to return to her par
ents in San Diego.
Davis returned to the northern part of
the State and in April of this year his
mother brought suit in his name and her
own against Mac Davis to have the mar
riage annulled, alleging tnat her son was
less than 19 years oid, and as she had not
given her consent she alleged that the
marriage was null and void.
Mrs. Mac Davis and her parents were
too poor to employ a lawyer, so the case
was allowed to go against them by default
on the 29th of last May. On the sth of
June following Judge Hebbard entered a
decree declaring the marriage annulled.
Subsequently Davis niarried a worthy
young woman in Santa Rosa, in this in
stance taking the precaution to secure his
mother's consent and approval.
When the matter was drawn to Judge
Hebbard's attention yesterday he seemed
: to be greatly surprised to learn that he
had made so grievous an error as to de
clare annulled a leeal marriage; an error
that forever clouds the lives of two women
I and one man, though the man may not be
i held entirely blameless unless he pleaded
â  that in what he did he was swayed by the
indiscretions of youth.
Attorney Davidson stated the matter
very clearly. He said it was admitted that
Davis was only a few days over 18 years of
age at the time of the marriage and that
his parents had not assented to the same,
but contended that this did not constitute
a marriage that could be annulled.
The statute declares expressly that the
age of legal content for a male is 18 years,
and that in the event of a male marrying
before attaining that age the marriage
may be annulled. If that ape has been
reached then the matrimonial ties may be
severed only by a divorce secured in the
usual legal manner and for statutory rea
sons. In support of this position, the
provisions of the code and many Supreme
Court decisions were cited.
So thoroughly convinced was Judge
Hebbard of the wrong he had done to
Mrs. Mac Davis that he vacated the order
ot default that had been entered against
her, and on application of her attorney
dismissed the suit on the ground that
Davis being over 18 years of age at the
time of the marriage the court had no
jurisdiction in a suit to annul the mar
riage.
However much Judge Hebbard may re
gret the lamentable muddle in which the
affairs of the Davis lanihy have become
involved because of his inadvertent act in
granting annulment of a legal marriage
it is safe to say that this regret id more
than doubled by the deserted wife in San
Dieeo, as well as by the lady in Santa
Rosa who became Davis' second wife un
der the impression that he was legally
freed from his first marriage and presum
ing, as she thought she had a right to pre
sume, that Jud/e Hebbard knew what lie
was doing when he ordered the annul
ment of that marriage.
"Davis has no ground for divorce from
his tirst wile, Mrs. Mac Davis, and she
has a legal right to claim him as her hus
band," said Attorney Davidson. "I don't
know what she intends to do in the prem
ises. She has the privilege of suing for a
divorce and alimony, or for permanent
maintenance, or she may condone his
acts That is a matter for her own de
cision."
A letter was recently received from
England stating that Davis had fallen
heir to Â£60,000 by the death of an uncle.
CHRISTMAS SERVICE.
Church of the Holy Spirit Preparing for
Appropriate Celebration.
The Lutheran Church of the Holy Spirit,
Rev. Oliver C. Miller, Jackson street, near
Buchanan, is preparing for an enjoyable
Christmas for the congregation and the
Sunday-school, both of which are grow
ing. The communion last Sunday was
the most impressive and largest in the
history of the mission.
The church, beginning with nothing a
year ago, has been sustained without any
unsoriptural means for raising money.
Entlre.y by voluntary contributions a
neat little chapel has been ntted up, and
none of the services omitted from the
beginning, the pastor being in his pulpit
every Sunday since the first service In
November, 1895. There are now more
than forty communicants, two bei.ig added
last Sunday.
The advent season will be observed, and
to-morrow the theme of the morning ser
mon will be "Advent Hearts."
DEATH IN MANY POEMS.
Coroner Hawkins Held Half a Dozen
Inquests Yesterday.
The Coroner held several inquests yes
terday in cases where people have met
with violent deaths. Two verdicts were
returned in the case of J. G. Cavanaugh
of 664>^ Howard street, who on the 7th
inst. died from a fractured skull, caused by
being run down by a Mission-street electric
car on Mission street, near Army. C. M.
Daiss and W. Luchman, while exonerating
the motorman from all blame, censured
the railroad company for not providing
better and safer fenders. The other jury
men simply recommended that the cars
be provided with safer fenders.
A verdict of suicide was returned in the
case of Mrs. Judkins, also known as Lizzie
Emerson, of 17 Stockton street, who died
from taking morphine on December 6.
A similar verdict was rendered in the
case of Harry Thompson, an actor, who,
on the 6 h inst., ended his life by taking
morphine in a saloon at the Ocean beach.
Onhhe 4th inst. the body of Daniel Shea
of 102 Fifth street was recovered from the
bay at the foot of Fourth street. His rela
tives believed that he was robbed and
murdered and his Dody thrown into the
bay. The jury decided that the man
was drowned, but that they could not tell
under what circumstances.
KeeJingof B^B Jackson street took an
overdose of morphine on the 10th, but the
jury could not decide whether it was a
case of suicide or accident.
A verdict of accidental death was given
in the case of J. T Flahiff of 536 Bryant
street. Flabiff was a railroad switchman
and on the night of November 28 he was
run over by a freight train, and died the
next morning in St. Mary's Hospital.
On the 9th inst. Miss Hephzebah RobbÂ«,
a lady's maid in the Hotel Richelieu,
jumped from a thinlÂ«story window while
suffering from temporary insanity caused
by religious excitement. The jury's verdict
was suicide while temporarily insane.
Last week Tomi Fujisawa, a Japanese,
living at 357% Minna street, committed
suicide by hanging himself to a rafter. A
verdict to this effect was given.
DEFECTIVE COMPLAINTS.
J. F. Smith and Paul Avheos Escape
on a Technicality.
Judge Wallace has sustained tbe demur
rers in the cases of J. F. Smith and Paul
Ayhens, who stood charged with perjury,
and the accusations against tbsm were
thrown out of court.
The point made by Atto rneys Guilfoyle
and Dunne was that the information filed
by the District Attorney was not gram
matically worded and did not specifically
set forth that the defendants nad really
committed the crime of perjury in swear
ing that the names on Cal Ewing's nomi
nating petition, under tbe Australian bal
lot law, were genuine.
Judge Wallace asked that all tbe papers
be submitted to his inspection, and after
careful scrutiny announced that he con
sidered the point well taken, that the in
formations were fatally defective, and or
dered the defendants discharged from cus
tody.
A Quartz Mill Action.
An action has been begun in the United
States Circuit Court by tbe Risdon Iron and
Locomotive Works ngainst L. C. Trent of Salt
Lake for infringing upon the patont of an oro
crusher known as the Bryan Roller Quartz
Mill. The Risdon people lay claim to the
peient by reason of it? assignment by the in
ventor, August H. Schierholz. The action is

INDICTMENTS ON
THE SECRET FILE
Grand Jury Reports One for
Larceny Against Frank
Farragh.
Max and Meyer Livingston In
d'eted ior Perjuryâ Bench
Warrants Issued.
Farragh Is Accused of Taking Nine
Hundred Dollars From Lach
m n & Jacobi.
The Grand Jury yesterday afternoon
held one of those mysterious sessions that
people read about. Captain Spiilane was
there as mum as an oyster. Harry
Reynolds of the police force was as quiet
as a clam, and Detective Crocker seemed
oppressed by the possession of a great
secret. J. Jacob Jacobi of the house of
Lachman & Jacobi was one of the wit
nesses. E. S. Ciprico superintendent for
Lachman & Jacobi, was another witness,
and there were others.
Harry Reynolds was rent downstairs
for a package of edged tools, and the im
plements were duly exhibited to (he Grand
Jury.
Word was sent out by the Deputy
Sheriff for Judge Slack to wait, as the
jury had an important communication for
the court. Word came back that Judge
Slack was downtown and that Judge Heb
bard would receive the report. In due
time the jurors went into court. Indict
ments were filed against Meyer and Max
Livingston for perjury in connection with
insolvency proceedings. The testimony
which led up to these indictments wa3
fully published in last Saturday's Call.
The third indictment, about which there
was such a thick cloak of secrecy, was
against Frank Darragh for grand larceny.
The case was in the Police Court
last October, and did not stagger
the public by its importance. The
simple story is that Frank Darragh is
accused of stealing $900 from the firm of
Lacbman & Jacobi. He was indicted, and
Judge Hebbard, who was told by Assist
ant District Attorney Peixotto that the re
porters were nresent, airecttd the indict
ments to be placed on tbe secret file. A
bench warrant was issued for each person
indicted and bail in each case fixed at
$3000.
Frank Darraph is supposed to be living
in Berkeley. During the six or seven
suspicious postponements of his case he
has not deemed it expedient to change
his residence, out an apprehension was
expressed that he might nkip out if he
was advised by the newspapers that the
Grand Jury was after him.
Witnesses testified yesterday that money
was drawn from the bank by the firm of
Lachman & Jacobi for the purpose of pay
ing employes in the winehouse and cooper
shop. One sack containing $900 was placed
in a commode or stand resting against the
partition of the office. It is surmised that
Darragh cut a hole in the partition a day
or two before the money was placed in the
commode, and at the moment of opportu
nity grabbed the sack.
The Health Department Committee of
the Grand Juryâ A. E. Drucker, W. F.
Man and Richard Pecht â recently paid a
visit to the Pesthouse. Grand Jury expe
ditions to this institution are like angels'
visits, short and bright and few and far be
tween.
Tbe final report of the present Grand Jury
may be submitted to Judge Slack a day or
two before Christmas. Committees are
now engaged in preparing their reports.
A MISUNDERSTANDING.
Suit Against Mrs. Theodore Sntro of
New York by a Local Physlciaa
Dismissed.
About a month ago an article appeared
in The Call, to t:;e effect that Dr. Louis
Bazet of this City bad begun suit against
Florence Clinton Sutro, the wife of Theo
dore S.utro of New York.
It seems that the action was begun
through a misunderstanding, and a dis
missal of it has since been filed.

Church.

auditorium of Simpson Memorial Metho
dist Episcopal Church, corner of Hayes

dered by the choir. The public are in
vited to attend.
Colonel Dan Burns' Debt.
Attorney E. D. Sawyer filed an affidavit in
Judge Hunt's court yesterday setting forth
that the execution against Colonel D. M.
Burns and S. F. Long in favor of the Pacific
Bank for $2450 has been returned by the
Sheriff whoiiy unsatisfied. It is alleged in the
affidavit that the defendant Long is unable to
respond and thnt the defendant Burns has
property which he unjustly refuses to apply
In payment of the ilebt Judge Hunt has
ordered Colonel Burns to appear on December
19 and show cause why he does not pay the
