LOYALTY TO MAJOR McKINLEY
Splendid Surprises the Order
of the Day at Canton.
Men of All Classes Assure Protec
tion's Champion That They
Support Him.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 26.â This was a
. day of splendid surprises for Major Mc-
Kinley and his friends. They were not
expecting a Jively time or any large dele-
J , fcttons, but it proved to be the most im-
jortant Monday of the campaign, and
. seven delegations, one numbering about
â¢ -3000, came to pay their respects to the can
didate. The belief that owing to the
nearness of election day delegations will
contain fewer persons seems to have been
unfounded. The delegations came to-day
from Massachusetts, New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and
'Illinois. Ihe throngs were perhaps more
enthusiastic than ever. Major McKinley's
health and voice were at their best. There
was an uncommon variety m the charac-
ter of the delegations, and all branches of
: honest toil and professional life sent rep
.' resentatives. The weather was delightful.
Major McKinley received an interesting
communication to-day. It was signed by
â¢ 288 Union veterans of Crowiey County,
Kans., who are favorable to the principles
of the Republican party, and who believe
that the hope ot the country rests in its
triumph, and pledge themselves to sup
port the candidate. The signatures are
affixed to the document. Crowley County
is the birthplace of Populism.
Major McKinley began his last week of
speech-making with an address to 400
'employes of the Baltimore and Ohio
Southern Railroad from the towns of Sey
mour and Washington, Ind. O. H. Mont
gomery oi Seymour was spokesman. He
reviewed the issues of the campaign in a
. forceful, convincing way and was roundly
applauded when he declared: "The best
. dollar that was ever adorned by the God-
dess of Liberty is none too gootl for those
'â¢ who toil."
Major McKinley was greeted with pro
longed cheers when he stepped forward to
speak. His remarks were accordingly
earnest and were in the main confined to
a discussion of (he relations between em-
ployar and employe. He aaid there must
le no coercion, but thorough harmony
and co-operation.
The next callers were 600 employes of
I the Cleveland, ix>raine and Wheeling
road. Their spokesman was L. H. Eddy,
a locomotive engineer, who made a brief
ringing speech. Major McKinley ad
dressed the delegation on the money and
tariff issues.
The delegation of the day in which the
.liveliest interest centered was one from
Newark and Trenton, N, J., which reached
. ... Major McKinley's Bhortly after half-past
11. The New Jersey men had to await
their turn to be addressed, as there were
two delegations immediately in advance
of them. The New Jersey delegation was
accompanied by 100 members of the Fre
linghuysen Lancers, a splendid organiaa
tion, formed in 1868, and probably the
most thoroughly drilled and handsomely
uniformed body of men that has been seen
in Canton during the campaign. The ex
cursion was organized by the Republicans
of Newark. The lancers had with them
their own drum corps of thirty members.
The speaker for the delegation was John
R. Gibson, Comptroller of the city of
Newark. He said :
"We have journeyed nearly a thousand
miles to bring you a message of cheer from
the citizens of our great industrial city
and to give you the assurance, if further
' assurance is needed, that the State of
Garret A. Hobart will give a majority of
.' 50,000 for the restoration of our industries,
for tne better employment of our citizens
and for the continuance of a financial
* . policy as sound as the Government itself."
â¢ â¢ Major McKinley responded as follows:
I bid you warm welcome to my State, my
city and mv home. I think we all have a
: growing affection for the original thirteen
. States that laid the foundation for our splen
did political fabric. For more than 120 years
I- â¢â . has stood the shock of battle from without
L-. Rud from within, and is stronger and more
X jatriotic to-day than it has ever been, as will
be seen by its vote a week from to-morrow.
New Jersey has the distinction of being one
of those glorious thirteen original States. She
not only has the distinction of membership
in that original family, but she is full of his
toric memories and sacred historic events
leading up to our independence. I
â¢ am glad to meet you at my home, members of
this old and historic company, twenty-eight
._ 'years old and tearing the honored name of
Frelinghuysen, one of the most illustrious not
only in the annals of your State, but in the
annals of the Nation as well â a name that is
â¢ synonymous with protection to our industries
"and to our National honor; a name that is
synonymous with honest linance, good cur
rency and public and private morality. I.am
glad to welcome you, my fellow citizens from
the State and home of my distinguished asso
â  . ciate on the ticketâ that splendid typical rep
.'resentative American, that honest Citizen,
that incorruptible statesman, Gafret A. Ho
bart. [Loud and prolonged cheers.]
No ordinary event could have brought you
a thousand miles to the city of Canton; no
ordinary political contest could have assem
bled on tnls lawn thousands and tens of thou
sands of men and women from every quarter
Â»\ this country. It is only because in the
public mind there exists a belief that we are
confronted with a great public peril, and be
cause we mean by our votes to shun and
avoid it. This is the meaning of it all. We
have experienced only calamity by following
false teachers. We don't propose to experience
nnother and greater calamity by following the
same teachers. We have already withstood
the experience of partial free trade, a policy
Athe result of which your eminent spokesman
â ms so fittingly described, "a policy that has
mro ught idleness upon our workingmen Â«nu
\i nguished the fires in our furnaces. Tnis
ha* been your experience tor the past three
and a half years.
It is proposed'now to add to that, as though
we had not suffered enough, that fatal heresy
that some how or another people can get rich
by debasing our currency. They have reduced
wages, reduced employment, and now they
The San Francisco Call
want to reduce the value of the money in
which they are paid. So that we are suffering
in both directions. What we want in the
United States is a stable tariff law that will
raise enough money to pay all the current ex
penses of the Government, that will obviate
the necessity of borrowing and lay up a sur
plus to wipe out the existing debt.
The largest delegation came from the
Erie lines between Salmanica, N. V., and
Chicago. It was made up of Erie em
ployes between those poinis and numbered
nearly 3000. The parade was led .by 150
women, who bore a banner inscribed:
â¢ Hip! Hip! Hurray 1
: Who are we? :
: The Women's Auxiliary. :
The women in the auxiliary came from
Huntington, Ind. The delegation of em
ployes was a small array in itself. Every
man carried a small flag and it was a
pretty sight to see 2000 or 3000 of them
wariug as the long line passed up the hill
to the McKinley home.
Ths McKiniey yard did not hold all of
the. employes. Major McKinley aban
doned the porch and spoke from a chair
placed on a table near the center of the
Jawn. The cheers which greeted him
were deafening.
The Erie delegation presented Mrs. Mc-
Kinley with a very handsome and elabo
rate floral decoration.
The next delegation was not large, but
it was a representative one. It came from
Boston and was composed of twenty-three
men, th- executive committee of the Rail
road Men's Non- Partisan Sound-money
League of New England. Alexander Rob
ertson, president of the club, said in his
remarks to Major McKinley that the dele
gation represented every branch of rail
road work and that it also represented
30,000 railroad employes of New England.
The delegation was escorted from the
station by the' Grand Army band of forty
musicians and by the Canton Mounted
Troop. Major McKinley received it in
his library.
The last delegation of the day was com
posed of wheelwomen.of Ma?>sillon, Ohio,
and Chicago. It is the first organized
wheeiwomen's McKinley club in the
country. Robert Skinner introduced
Major McKinley, who addressed some
pleasant remarks to them.
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 27, 1896.
PREPARING FOR THE GRAND PARADE.
BRYAN CULLS WORKMEN "PUBLIC BEGGARS."
HARRISBURG, Pa., Oct. 26.â" You are a robber. You are public beggars."
This harsh language was applied by William Jennings Bryan while a member of Congress to a body of window
glass workers who appeared before the House Committee on Ways and Means in behalf of a tariff to protect their labor,
in September, 1893. Mr. Bryan was a member of the Ways and Means Committee and did all he could to destroy every
vestige of protection to labor in the compilation of the tariff bill that is now law. This statement is sworn to by
James Campbell of Pennsylvania, one of the best known window-glass workers in the United States â a gentleman who
has been foremost in the eftorts of workingmen before Congress to secure protection to American labor â and by Charles
Bryant of Anderson, Ind., another window-glass worker, well known to members of the glass-blowers' associations
throughout the country. Their affidavits are as follows:
A committee, representing the Window-glass Workers' organization of America, composed of John P. Eberhart, president, A. M.
Hammet, treasurer, and James Campbell, all of Pittsburgh, Pa.; G. L. Cake and John Keuley of Jeanette, Pa.; Charles Bryant of Alexan
dria, Ind., and Joseph Ripgins of Bridgeton, N. J., were sent to Washington in September, 1893, to protest against any reduction of the
tariff on window glass. We produced conclusive evidence to any fair-minded man that a reduction of the tariff would result in c. reduc
tion of the wades of the workers. Notwithstanding that evidence, the Tariff was reduced and a reduction of the workers' wages followed.
W. J. Bryan, now candidate for President on the Democratic ticket, was a member of the Ways and Means Committee at that time, and
alter the committee had adjourned, a manufacturer who was present got into a conversation with Mr. Bryan, and was explaining to him
the beneficial results that the people of this country had received under the protective tariff system, and if the tariff on window-glass
was reduced as they proposed, he would lje forced to reduce the wages of the workers, which he had no desire to do. Mr. Bryan looked
him straight in the eye and said, "You are a robber." One of our committee spoke up and said, "Mr. Bryan, if the employer is a rob
ber, what are the workingmen?" He promptly replied, "You are public beggars." One of our committee said, "We do not consider
it begging to ask for protection against the cheap labor of foreign countries." He said, '-Nevertheless, you are public beggars," and
with that he left the committee-room.
The above is substantially what occurred after the.Ways and Means Committee had adjourned.
October 12. 1896. (Signed) James Campbell.
Personally appeared before me, J. D. Patterson, Mayor of Harrisburg, James Campbell, who, being duly sworn, doth say that the
foregoing statement is true and correct . J. D. Patterson, Mayor. [Seal.]
Anderson, Ind., Sept. 25, 1896.
Mr. Charles E. Flood, Moundsville, W. Va.â Dear Sir: Yours of the 23d inst. received. You ask me to take oath to what I stated
in answer to your former letter. In substance I said that myself and others were- sent to Washington in 1893 for the purpose of
making a statement before the Ways and Means Committee in reference to the tariff on window-glass. Some of our men had a con
versation with Mr. Bryan after the full committee had adjourned. I was not present all of the time they were, talking tariff, but
I was present and did hear Mr. Bryan say, "You are public beggars." The answer was made, "We do not look upon it as begging to
ask for protection against the importation ot foreign product." He then said, "Nevertheless, you are public beggars. " He left us
with this. To all this I swear. Yours truly, (Signed) Charles Bryant.
Subscribed and sworn to before me this, the 19th day of October 1896.
Edmund Johnson, Clerk Madison Circuit Court Indiana.
At the time of the foregoing occurrence Congressman Bryan was striving with might and main to completely de
stroy our system of meeting Government exDenses by import duties and substituting them with a direct tax upon our peo
ple. The direct tax became a law and was set aside as unconstitutional. While in Congress Mr. Bryan made many utter
ances of equal violence apainst a protpctive tariff law. Among other things he said, in answer to a question by Congress
man McKenna of California, March lfi, 1892, that "the protective policy is similar to the pickpocket policy of putting a
man's hand into another man's pocket and extracting money from it." In the debate on the floor of the House upon the
present tariff law, Mr. Bryan said that "our present system is a vicious system, created by the necessities of war and con
tinued by favoritism."
AgÂ«in he said that "the purpose of the protective tariff was to transfer money from one man's pocket to another
man's pocket." In the Bame connection Mr. Bryan declared that a tariff for revenue only could not be levied without its
authors so arranging schedules as to make it a tariff for protection, and therefore he was opposed to a tariff, because ho
was opposed to a protective tariff.
He believes in meeting all the expenses of the Government by a direct tax upon the people and in having absolute
free trade.
THIRTY THOUSAND TO MARCH SATURDAY
All Signs Show That the Parade Will
Break the California Record.
Committeemen From All Industries Are at Work and
Encouragement Comes From All
Walks of Life.
BISMARCK'S DOUBLE DEALING.
Declared to Have Had a Separate Entente
With Russia Without the Dreibund's
Knowledge.
PARIS, France, Oct. 26.â The Temps,
in an article commenting npon Prince
Bismarck's recent communication to his
personal organ, the Hamburger Nach
richten, describing tne origin of the
entente between Russia and France, says
it is an obvious truth that Prinoe
Bismarck, without the knowledge of his
partners in the Dreibund, had a separate
entente with Russia from 1884 to 1890, not
only detaching Russia from France in the
event of the latter attacking Germany, but
also detaching Germany from Austria in
the event of Austria making an attack
upon Russia.
"BismamK," the Temps adds, "always
played a double game and the revelation
of the Nachrichten must weaken the Drei
bunci."
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 26.âSkepti
cism is observed in political circles and in
most of the newspaper.} regarding the
truth of the Hamburger Nachrichten's
article. The oiicial newspapers make no
reference whatever to the story.
VIENNA, Austria, Oct. 26.â For some
reason the opinion is held in Government
circles here that the article in the Ham
burger Nachrichen alluded to the old
Prussian-Russian treaty that was in effect
long previous to the Triple Alliance. This
treaty has never been formally canceled.

Southampton Hoc.'c Laborers Entitled to
Better fay.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 26.â At a meeting
of dock laborers at Southampton it was
decided to take a ballot in two weeks to
decide whether to go on strike to secure
better wages, or whether to wait until
the dock laborers should be better organ
ized. â¢
J. H. Wilson, member of Parliament for
Middlesborough, secretary of the National
Seamen's Union, addressed the meeting.
He said that freights during the last few
months had risen from 100 to 150 per cent,
and that the dock laborers ought not to be
satisfied with an incease in wages repre
senting less than 33 per cent of the ad
vance in freights.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
Next Saturday the Republicans every
where in the land will unfurl the flag to
the breeze. The following messaee cama
yesterday from the Republican National
Committee:
Chicago,, lll., Oct. 26, 1896.
Hon. Frank McLaughlin, Palace Hotel, San
Francisco: You will please direct county
chairmen in your State to make a special
effort for the celebration of Flag Day, Satur
day, October 31, by calling upon all Repub
licans to assemble in the cities, villages and
hamlets nearest their homes, and show their
patriotism, devotion to country and the flag,
and their intention to support the party which
stands for protection, sound money and good
government, by having patriotic speeches and
such other exercises as wili be appropriate for
the occasion, and tend to make the tlay a gen
eral holiday as far as possible. It is to bo
hoped that Republicans everywhere will unite
to dedicate the day to this patriotic service.
M. A. llan.va, Chairman.
San Francisco has had many memorable
parades and political demonstrations, but
it seems certain now that the conspicuous
events of the past will be surpassed by tha
great demonstration next Saturday. The
parade is not only the talk of the town,
but is the talk of all the town within a
day's journey of the bay.
Special efforts are now directed on behalf
of the Republican State Central Commit
tee to get as many retail stores as possible
to close at noon and remain closed until
4 o'clock. In addition to closing there
tail merchants are earnestly invited to
decorate their places of business and dis
play the flag.
Tom Reed will arrive in San Francisco
next Saturday forenoon. Yesterday
Frank McLau^hlin appointed Charles M.
Shortridge, Senator Eli Denison, F. W.
Van Sicklen and W. M. Rank as the com
mittee to meet Mr. Reed on behalf of the
Republican State Central Committee, and
escort the illustrious statesman to San
Francisco. These gentlemen left the City
for the south yesterday afternoon to per
form the distinguished and agreeable
duty.
No special privileges or exclusive favors
will be accorded to any class or caste at
the pavilion next Saturday evening. Peo
ple will not be allowed to go there in the
afternoon and pre-empt seats. There ia
only one place reserved, and that is for
Mr. Reed. The doors of the pavilion will
be opened at 7 o'clock. No exception can
be made in favor of ladies, or gentlemen
escorting ladies, to the exclusion of others.
The telephone is constantly ringing up
the Republican State Central Committee
to file requests from ladies for reserved
places. The committee is constrained to
decline all such requests.
The Republican State Central Commit
tee has assigned to Samuel M. Shortridge
the duty of presiding at the paviiion and
of introducing to the audience the distin
guished orator from Maine.
Yesterday was a busy day with the
managers of the great Saturday's parade.
There were committee meetings all over
the City, embracing nearly every branch
of industry, and at night there was a busy
session of the various parade committees
at the Pioneer buiiding.
Colonel Stone announced last night that
he had every assurance that the demon
stration would excel anything ever seen
west of Chicago and that probably 30,000
people would be in line.
"Reports from all directions are highly
encouraging," he said, "and I have no
doubt whatever that the event will dis
count anything ever seen in the great
West. As a sample of what is being done
many lines of industry will furnish from
500 to 1000 men, and I am informed that
5000 people will come from Oakland, Ala
meda and Berkeley. The idea ia popular
everywhere, and nowhere more than ia
this City."
It has been decided that no local busi
ness or candidate shall be allowed to have
banners, advertisements or transparen
cies in the lines. There will be no floats
other than those bearing on the National
issues, and all mottoes must be revised by
the committee.
Twenty thousand yellow ribbons will be
circulated to-morrow to be worn by men
who propose to march in the parade. An
appropriate sentiment will bo printed on
them.
Chairman Sumner of the parade com
mittee has sent a letter to Republican
clubs and Republicans throughout tha
northern ana central part of the Stale re
questing them to be pr sent and take part
in the parade. Each club or organization
is requested to send Grand Marshal Stone
the name of the marshals elected at once.
There was an enthusiastic meeting of
the Pacific Coast Hardware and Metal

to further arrange for money for the

Oscar Lewis made a aery but brief j

want none but McKinley men in the pa
rade. The others can stand on the cross
ings and weep because they are not on the
Bame side of the house, but no co- j
ercion.' 1

RETURES INDICATE VICTORY.
Republicans Count Thirty-three State*
for Major Me Kinley.
CHICAGO, 111.. Oct. 26. -The final week
of the Presidential campaign was entered
upon by the campaign staff at Republican
National Headquarters with expressed
confidence in an overwhelming victory
for Major McKinley. Mr. Hanna counted
thirty-three of the forty-five States for the
Republicans. The chief will make a final
and complete statement as to the probable
result of the election Saturday night, just
prior to his departure for his home.
A report received by Colonel Hahn
from Chairman Coe of the Wisconsin
State Committee states there is raoid im
provement in the rural districts of that
State since the middle of the month and
the same was true of Milwaukee. Mr.
Coe adds,:
"1 estimate that Wisconsin is safely Re
publican by 60,000 to 80,000 plurality.
Both branches of the Legislature will be
strongly Republican, and all the ten Con
gressional districts will elect Republican
members to Congress."
Dr. Edward Bedloe, ex-Consul to Amoy,
China, who has been campaigning among
the gold Democrats, was at headquarters.
He showed a letter which I.c had received
from Admiral Belknap, U. S. N., partly as
follows:
"I am combating the heresies of free
silver coinage and the abominations of
the Chicago platform. I shall vote the
Republican ticket this year for the first
time in my life. A friend remonstrated
with me the other day because I am going
to vote for McKinley."
Arrangements have been made with the
five trunk lines which run west from St.
Louis through Missouri to send a special
train on each of the roads Wednesday
morning for a tour of the State, under the
management of the commercial travelers'
clubs of St. Louis, in the interest of Mc-
Kinley. There will be twenty men and
five speakers on each train.
Chairman Hauna directed the following
telegram sent to chairmen of the ReDub
lican State Central Committees, through
out the country:
"Yon will please direct county chair-,
men in your State to make a special effort
for Flag day, Saturday, October 31, by
calling on ail Republicans to assemble in
the cities, villages and hamlets nearest
their homes and show tbeir patriotism,
devotion to country and the flag and their
intention to support the party which
stands for protection, sound money and
good government by having patriotic
speeches and such exercises as will be ap
propriate for the occasion and tend to
make the day a general holiday as far as
possible. It is to be hoped that Republi
cans everywhere will unite to dedicate
this day to this patriotic service. 1 '
Mr. Hanna says he has received good
reports to-day from California, Kansas,
Kentucky and Michigan, all denoting a
return movement of silver Republicans.
DEGRADING IN THE COUNTRY
That Is Mr. Hob art's Opinion of the
.Free Silver fallacy. ".,
CAMDEN, N. J.. Oct. 26.â Hon. Garret
A. Hobart, the Republican Vice-Presi
dential candidate, made his first formal
address of the campaign here to-night.
He was enthusiastically received.
Mr. Hobart and party, including Gov
ernor John W. Griggs, State Committee
man William Pettle and Hobart Tuttle,
secretary to the Governor, arrived in Phila
delphia from Jersey City shortly after 2
o'clock this afternoon, and were driven to
the Hotel Bellevue in that city, where
luncheon was served. ..
They were then escorted to this city and
taken to the headquarters of the Camden
Republican Club, where an informal re
ception was held by Mr. Hobart and the
Governor. The reception ; lasted from 4
o'clock to 6 o'clock, and during this time
a constant stream of persons were greeted
by the distinguished guests. The party
was then entertained at dinner by United
States Senator Sewell at his residence, and
at 8 o'clock they proceeded to the Temple
Theater, where Mr. Hobart and Governor
Grig's made addresses.
The city was gayly decorated in honor
of the occasion, the displays of flags and
bunting being elaborate. After opposing
the Wilson bill the speaker turned his at
tention to the financial question and dis
sected the money plank of the Chicago
platform, which convention he declared
was ' not a Democratic' gathering. 1 He
made a lengthy explanation of 16 to 1,
argued upon the fallacy of the movement
and classed it as degrading to the country.
Mr.' Hobart declared that the only per
sons who would bB benefited by the free
and unlimited 'coinage of silver would be
silver-mine owners and silver - bullion 1
dealers, and he was emphatic in stating
that it would make every other man's
dollar worth 50 cents.
Mr. Hobart treated the money issue in
a concise manner, and classed as persons
"who would 'suffer the most by this de
bauching proposition" the savings fund
I depositors, those: interested in building
and ; loan associations, pensioners, life-;
insurance - policy /â¢ holders ; and wage
earners, all of whom would : ' receive just
naif of the face value of their claims. ,: "I
have but little patience' with this silver
business," the nominee went on to say,
"for it seems to me that a bare statement
of what it is would damn it." V
Mr. Hobart stated that reputable Demo
crats are not supporting Bryan. â  -He
quoted the financial plank of the
Republican platform and concluded:
"Such Â«is * the .' platform - upon which
I stand. I accept its "^principles.
I y approve : its policy. :â  It I? needs 7no
argument to sustain it. In addition to
this formulation of its ; expressed pro
visions, I believe, as I stated in my letter
of acceptance, that an honest dollar
worth 100 cents cannot be coined out of
50 cents' worth of X silver : plus a legis
lative fiat." .. . y

BRIM AMONG
COLLEGE BOYS
He Becomes a Boy Again
While Associating With
Students.
But the Young Nebraskan Cannot
Refrain From Aliuding to
Politics,
SPEAKS FOR FREE COINAGE.
Farmers Flock Into Jacksonville to
See the Talkative Candidate
for President.
JACKSONVILLE, 111.. Oct. 26.â This
was not William J. Bryan's busy day. He
spent most of it in the environment of old
college association and late in the after
noon left the old educational community
of Jacksonville, where, surrounded by
many of those who knew him as a student
years ago, he enjoyed nearly two whole
days of restful quiet, the pleasantest
period since his hardworking campaign
began. It is true that his Jacksonville
visit included two long addresses and an
other brief one, but the robust young
nominee, with his record of thirty
speeches in a single day, did not consider
such slight effort as worthy of designation
as labor. He became a boy again in the
morning as he sat with the students of his
alma mater In the college chapel. He
sang with them, and then made some in
teresting remarks defensive of himself
with reference to insinuations that his
purposes in leading the present agitations
were not the beat. A thrust at Major
McKinley was contained in the' few
words he addressed to a delegation of visi
tors from the porch of the house where he
was a guest, when he said that a speech
made from a porch could not be consid
ered undignified.
In the afternoon a great Democratic
rally was held in Jacksonville, and Mr.
Bryan made two speeches to large crowds,
concluding his second in time to leave for
Alton on the regular train, to which his
special car had been attached. This Mis
sissippi River town had him for three
hours to-nigh*;, and the silver people resi
dent and visiting hea^d two speeches.
Shortly after 10 o'clock Mr. Bryan left
Alton, in continuation of his journey. He
is due to reach Chicago to-morrow.
The streets of Jacksonville began to
show evidences early this morning that
some special event was about to take place
in the pretty college town. Vehicle-, in
which people had driven many miles,
lined up along the curbs of the principal
streets, while the sidewalks were crowded
with excursionists. The presence of Wil
liam J. Bryan and his wife in the com
munity where they were educated and
spent the first years of their married life
was the magnet that attracted so many
visitors, all of whom had come to see and
hear the candidate deliver a speech on the
public square in the afternoon.
Horsemen attired in red, white and blue
sashes and decorations of shimmering sil
ver foil galloped about the thoroughfares
of JacKsonville irom an early hour, and
the occasional arrival of brass bands and
free silver clubs added to the excitement
and interest that pervaded the little city.
Mr. Bryan beean his day in a very pleas
ant way. Surrounded by students of his
alma mater lie made an address in the
chapel of the Illinois State College in the
forenoon in which he denied insinuations
that he wa3 not actuated by earnest belief
in advocating the free coinage of silver,
and maintained that he was anxious to
do the greatest good to the greatest num
ber of people in the United States.
The little chapel was crowded. No dis
play was attempted, the reJicious exer
cises that were practiced in Mr. Bryan's
time and are still maintainod being car
ried out in all their simplicity. Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan joined the students in sing
ing "America," and in the responses to
the twenty-fifth psalm, which preceded
the introduction of the candidate by Dr.
J. E. Bradley, the president of the college.
When Mr. Bryan concluded there was
great cheering, and again the students
broke forth when President Bradley an
nounced a holiday in honor of the Demo
cratic nominee. Tne members of the
Sigma Phi Society escorted Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan to their carriage, singing their
fraternity song and sent another cheer
after them as they were driven away.
The crowd at the public square began
to collect early, and at 2 o'clock, when Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan arrived, about 12,000
people were conj;rei;ated closely around
the broad platform from which the candi
date spoke, while as many unable to hear
gathered on the streets in tliat vicinity.
During the hour and a quarter occupied
by Mr. Bryan the enthusiasm was fre
quent and occasionally prolonged. His
audience was composed almost entirety of
farmers, and was undoubtedly in sym
pathy with his expressed views.
Mr. Bryan also spoke to an audience of
women at the opera-house, where a recep
tion in honor of Mrs. Bryan was held.
In the course of his speech Mr. Bryan
said:
It is always pleasing to meet a large number
of people in any part of ihe country, but it Is
especially gratifying to find bo many willing
to turn out on this occasion when I come back
to the city which was for many years my
hour. 1 . 1 1 is gratifying to meet again the
friends whom I used to know and to learn by
their presence and their words that ihe ac
quaintance then formed Is coutinued and the
good will that they so often manifested then Is
still evident. 1 come back as the representa
tive of a great principle, ns the champion of a
great cause, as the candidate of those who be
lieve that tho American people are able to at
tend to their own business. [Great cheering.]
After the exercises in the college chapel
Mr. Bryan made a little speech to the del
egation from the porch of the residence of
his host, Dr. R. K. Jones, in wnich he
said he had -been accused of being undig
nified in going around the country to see
the people, but that certainly there would
be no criticism of him in making that
speech, as it was made from the porch of
a bouse, which seemed to be the proper
thing. The thrust was understood and
appreciated by the crowd.
Leaving Jacksonville at 4:15, Mr. Bryan
reached Alton at 7 o'clock. He made
short speeches on the trip at Roodhouse
and at Jersey viile and shook hands with
a number of people at Kane and Godfrey.
At Alton two big open-air audiences
both gathered about the City Hall, and
were addressed by Mr. Bryan to-night.
He spoke from two sides of the building.
Each address was devoted largely to the
money question, grounds familiar to the
readers of the nominee's speeches bein^
covered. At 10:15 (-'clock Mr. Bryan left
Alton for an all-night ride to Lincoln,
lil.. where he will speak in the morning.
His itinerary for to-morrow calls for
Bloomington, Pontiac, Dwight, Braid
wood, Jiiiet and Lamout, with Chicago
scheduled for 3:30 p M.

IN SILENT DISGUST.
That Is Blow Watson Will Spend the Re-
mainder of the Campaign.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 26.â A1l negotia
tions which were being conducted by
Western Chairman Wash burn of the Pop
ulist National Committee, representing
Candidate Watson, and Chairman Jones
of the Democratic National Committee,
for the purpose of solidifying the middle
of-the-road Populist vote for Bryan, were
officially declared at an end to-day by Mr.
Washburn in au interview with a reporter
for the United Associated Presses. Dem
ocratic State committees, particularly the
silver Democracy of Georgia and Tennes
see, are blamed for the failure of the nego
tiations. Mr. Watson will spend the
remainder of the campaign practically in
silent di.Â«sust, and his interesting letter of
acceptance will likewise not appear in
public to hurt the candidacy of Mr. Bryan.
Mr. Washburn said:
The negotiations which were pending be
tween Senator Jones and myself are all off
now. There were a few States where fusion
was pending, and we were trying to consum
mate arrangements. Wnen I visited Georgia I
saw that it was vitally essentiul that all com
plications should be adjusted at once so that
the solid vote of the middle-of-the-road Popu
lists might be secured for Bryan, Upou my
return, while we were arranging these mat
ters, it was flashed over the wires that the
Georgia and Tennessee Democrats had re
jei'ted the overtures made by the Populists,
and adjourned without making a counter
proposition. This was most unfortunate, as it
occurred at a time when it seemed apparent
that all complications would be removed, our
people satisfied and Bryan's election made
certain. As these two States were involved in
our arrangements this action rendered It im
possible to continue negotiations. They wire
bruKen off, and a conference arranged with
Mr. Watson and Mr. Reed at Nasnville that I
might report to them the facts cf the case. The
responsibility for all this must rest squarely
upon the shoulders of the Georgia and Tennes
see Democracy. They seemed more anxious
to beat tho Populists than to elect Bryan, aad,
whatever the results, the odium of their un
patriotic action must rest upon them.
In all justice to Senator Jones I must cay
that from the beginning he has been eager to
remove all complications and effect an equit
able fusion in every State. He lias always
shown a much greater degree of patriotism in
these arrangements thin the State committee
of nis party, who were more anxious to make
sureofthe'ir State tickets than they were to
meet Populist committees half way ip perfect
ing fusion. There will be no further negotia
tions and whether our people and canoidato
have bien recognized to the extent or not our
committee desire* that every Populist shall
prove his patriotism in helping at the polls to
elect Bryan, just as they did in nominating
him at St. Louis. This is no time for tne set
tlement of differences. Our duty is to secure
the triumpn of silver and every Populist
should do his share and settle party differ
ences after election.
I do not see what good would be ac
complished at this late day by the publication
of Mr. Watson's letter, as Mr. Watson has
made plain the principal points of his letter in
his public speecnes; therefore I do not favor
its publication.
WILL SUPPORT BRYAN
But General Doe Cannot Stomach the
Chicngo Platform.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 26.â The
letter of General Joseph B. Doe, Assistant
Secretary of War, in which he announces
his intention of supporting Mr. Bryan,
was made public to-day Dy the Assistant
Secretary, whose views on political mat
ters have thus come into sharp conflict
with those of Colonel Daniel Lamont, the
Secretary of War. Assistant Secretary
Doe addresses his letter to a friend in Wis
consin (from which State he was ap
pointed), and in the course of it says, as
already reported, that he cannot accept
the Chicago platform as a correct declara
tion of Democratic principles; that he
does not favor the free and unlimited
coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1 by
our Government alone; that he greatly de
plores the attitude of the convention to
ward the National administration; that he
can find no comfort in the St. Louis plat
form or its candidates, and that he detests
all that is implied by the term "McKinley
ism." He continues:
I do not believe an honest or earnest effort
will be made ly the next administration,
Bhould it be Republican, to enact legislation
in the interests of the masses of the people in
reference to matters wherein those interests
may be opposed to the interests of the favored
classes. The need of the country Is that some
definite determination should bo arrived at as
to the character of our measure of value, and
I do not believe the election of McKinley
would permanently settle the financial ques
tion now before the people. Republican suc
cess would simply prolong the struggle and
continue our financial policy.
The election of Bryan would definitely settle
tne fiuancial question and at least enable in
vestors to calculate as to the future. Some
commercial disturbance may follow the adop
tion of a silver basis, but I do not believe tnat
Universal wre::k and chaos would follow, as is
predicted by those who advocate the election
of Mr. McKialey.
NO FURTRER INSULIS
John G. Carlisle JVou 1 Receive* R*npect
in Kentucky.
OWENSBORO, Ky., Oct. 26.â Secretary
John G. Carlisle spoke in the Tabernacle
here this afternoon to 7000 people. He
was given the most respectful attention
and there were no attempts at anything
like disorder. There were a great many
ladies in the audience and many of them
sent flowers to the stage. There were peo-'
pie present from all over the western por
tion of the State and saveral hundred
came over from Southern Indiana.
Hon. R. H. Taylor introduced Mr. Car
lisle, who was greeted with tremendous
applause. In opening his speech Mr.
Carlisle referred to his former visit to
Owensboro, which was the occasion for a
speech against Populism. He said he was
here to-day for this same purpose, but
some people now called Populi-xn Democ
racy. Mr. Carlisle's speech was similar to
those delivered at Covington and Bowling
Green. Previous to the speaking, Mr.
Carlisle held a reception at the Rudd
House and nearly 1000 people shook hands
with him.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 26.â Secretary
Carlisle arrived from Owensboro at 8:20
o'clock and spent the evening in the
Courier-Journal office. Up to tho time he
lett he had not received a reply to a tele
gram sent by him to Covington inquiring
if he was eligible to register, but a dis
patch from Covington, printed in an after
noon paper, says that Mr. Carlisle will be
able to qualify "as a voter. If such is the
case Mr. Carlisle will not return to Wash
ington until after the election. Mr. Car
lisle will speak here Wednesday night at
the Auditorium. The National Demo
crats are preparing to make it the greatest
political demonstration ever held in this
city.
PALMER AND BUCK NER.
They Are Greeted -by Very Enthusiastic
'â : Crowd* in
? COUNCIL ; BLUFFS, lowa, Oct. 26.â
Generals Palmer and Buckner added an
other successful day to their campaign to
day. This afternoon they, spoke an i hour
apiece in the Peavy Grand, at Sioux City, 7
to a highly enthusiastic audience. On the
way from i Sioux Ci 'i to * Council "â â  Bluffs
they.. were greeted at each - station by good
audiences, making | speeches at i Onawa,
Modale arid : Missouri Valley, being i pre
ceded briefly by General Buckner. There
they were met also by a large delegation
| from this r city, who acted *as j escort. On
their I arrival t here i they were i received Dy
members of the G. A. R. 100 strong, and a'
big crowd, wnich enthusiastically cheered
\ them all the way to their hotel, though
minded with the cheers were some shouts
for Bry*n.
The opera-house was completely packed
at their meeting here to-night. In the
party were Hon. T. J. Mahoney of Ne
braska, W. W. Witmore of Desmoines,
and lion. J. E. Markley of Mason City,
lowa, each of whom made brief addresses,
following the general's. T^e house was
enthusiastic in its reception of each of the
speakers and the general.* were especially
applauded. Though once or twice the
Bryan men in the hali ventured to cheer
their candidate, there was little interrup
tion and the meeting was a great success.
COVINGTON'S INDIGNATION
Citizens to Prosecute 'lhose Who Insulted
Carlisle.
COVINGTON, Ky., Oct. 26.â The law
abiding citizens of Covington, irrespective
of party affiliations, crowded Odd P'ellows 1
Hall to-night, the occasion being the
meeting called to condemn the action of
the rowdies wtio rotten-egged and other
wise insulted Secretary John G. Carlisle
last week.
Resolutions were adopted condemning
the outrage and insulis offered thb Secre
tary of the Treasury and demanding that
the city authorities offer a reward and
take steps to discover and punish the
offenders.
Hon. Henry Hall offered a substitute
for the resolution which censured the
Yale students for their discourtesy toward
Mr. Bryan. This was unanimously voted
down, on the ground that the meeting
was not called for that purpose.

Major SJeKinley to Jieeeive the Report of
the United Associated Presses.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 26.â A force of
linemen beean to-day the work of string
ing additional wires from the office cf the
Western Union Telegraph Company in
this city to Major McKmley's residence,
and on the night of the election the large
dining-room which connects with Major
McKinley'a library will be converted into
& veritable telegraph cilice. The candi
date was of the opinion tliat the returns
furnished him over the special wire which
at present connects his residence with the
Republican headquarters in New York and
Chicago would be sufficient as conveying
the result in a general way, but he has
yielded to the suggestions of several of
his personal friends and has permitted
additional wires to be placed in his home
for the reception of more complete and
detailed rey orts of the election. In addi
tion to the private-wire returns, Major
McKinley will receive the full election
night service of the United Associated
Presses over its special wire, which has
also been connected with the candidate's
home, together with the bulletins of the
Western Union Telegraph Company.
Will Carry West Virginia.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Oct. 26.â Hon.
Alexander McDowell, clerk of the House
of Representatives, spent Sunday in
Washington, after a week's campaigning
in West Virginia, and left to-day for his
home in Pennsylvania, where he will put
in the last week of tho campaign in the
district where ex-Congressman Sibley is a
candidate for Congress on the Silver-
Democratic ticket. Mr. McDowell ex
presses the opinion that McKinley will
carry West Virginia by from 18,000 to
25,000.
MINISTER BUCKANAN'S VIEWS.
Makes a Report to the State Department
on Money Prices in Foreign
Countries.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 26.â W. I.
Buchanan, United States Minister to the
Argentine Republic, in a report to the
State Department on money and prices in
foreign countries says:
A majority of those who have written to me
from tne United States regarding wageÃ and
prices have invariably asked me to give them
the result of my observations with regard to
the practical workings of the cheap-money
system of this country as it has Effected and
affects the farmer and wa^e-earner.
On this point let me say that from an ex
tended and careful personal observation I am
convinced that with possibly a fewexceptions,
all classes of workmen are here to-day receiv
ing less wages, the purchasing power of their
money being considered, than they were tea
years ago.
It is true and easily understood that as long
as gold was rising tho farmer, who was selling
his products as he had always done and con
tinues to do, on a gold price, fixed outside of
the country, was sieadily receiving higher
paper prices lor all that he had to sell, and was
in consequence a direct gainer by hign gold.
It is equally true that he has been the
gainer in other ways; he has paid but little
more rent if any ior his land than he paid five
years ago. Strange as its seems, he has paid
and is to-day paying but a trifle more to his
laborers than when gold tPas on a pr.r ten
yenrs ago, nna as lie produces on his form the
meat, vegetables, etc., necessary for his fam
ily he has had the lion's share of the gain iv
tlie rise in gold.
On the other hand, the workman found' it
very difficult to gel an increase in his wages
as gold advanced. It required four years for
him to get an average increase of 20 per cent
in his earnings, while the farmer has beep re
ceiving the benefits of an increase in the gold
premium averaging moro than 50 per
cent for the same period. In the mean
time the merchant found it easy and
profitable to Increase the price of
his goods, in keeping with the rise of
gold. Rents lik'-wise increased, although
more slowly, and as the prices of all commodi
ties rose the laborer found nimsell daily being
made poorer. Agitate as he would, he could
not get his salary increased in any reasonable
proportion to the increased premium of pold.
StriKes were resorted to; all sorts of efforts
made to bring about an increase in his re
ceipts, until finally the last year reached what
we may call "wago high-water mark."
Since then gold has steadily fallen. The
first person to feel the decline has been the
farmer, who is complaining bitterly of the
relatively low prices he is receiving for his
products, while he finds himsvlf obliged to
pay the same prices for what he buys that he
did when he received if 2 50 more for every 100
kilos of wheat that he now receives.
Low gold does not induce the merchant to
"mark down" his goods with the same good
will he manifested when he advanced their
price. Notwithstanding the decline in the
employer's income as cold falls, the woricmau
will not, in all probability, consent to a de
crease in his present wages without a bitter
fight; nor can he do so unless there is a sharp
decline in rents and in the cost of living.

BINNS OUT OF THE ARMY
President Cleveland Promptly
Accepts the Lieutenant's
Resignation.
Rapid Rise of ihe Oificer From the
Ranks Caused His Head
to Swell.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 26.â 1f Sec
ond Lieutenant Joseph R. Binns, Com
pany D, First Infantry, calculated that
his resignation would cause a stir in
Washington he clearly reckoned without
his host. Several weeks ago this officer
published a two- column letter in a Chi
cago paper, expressing his opinion that
a revolution will result in this country as
a result of the pendiDg political cam
paign, and as he was convinced
that the power of government would
be exercised against the people through
the use of Federal troops he did not pro
pose to remain longer in the military ser
vice. He stated that he had accordingly
forwarded nis resignation to Washington,
with a full statement of the reasons for
his course. Although this letter was pub
lished several weeks ago, his letter of
resignation was not received at the War
Department until this morning.
There was no delay of action upon his
resignation. Adjutant-General Ruggles
handed it to Secretary Lamont and the
latter took it over to the White House,
with the result that it was accepted forth
with and Lieutenant Binns is no longer
in the army.
Although his action in publicly assailing
the honor and integrity of his superior
officers was clearly in violation of tire ar
ticles of war and rendered him subject to
trial by court martial with a possible dis
honorable dismissal the authorities con
cluded to overlook his unmilitary conduct
and allow him to surrender his commis
sion without prejudice to his record.
Lieutenant Binns, who is alternately
referred to by his military associates as
"an anarchist" and "a calamity howler,"
is now in Chicago on leave of absence
working in the interest of the election of
.Bryan. His company is stationed at
Benicia Island, California. He entered
the service as a private soldier
in March, 1890, and subsequently
became corporal, in which capacity he
served until November, 1893, when he was
appointed second lieutenant of the First
infantry. He received his commission as
a result of a competitive examination
among enlisted men. He is a man of good
education, but is said to be far in advance
of the times in his ideas of political and
social economy.

Patrick Tynan Denies Most
Emphatically That He
Is a Dynamiter.
An Inkling as to the Mission
That Took the Suspect
Abroad.
HCPEFUL FOR THE IRISH CAUSE
Says That in His Recent Trip He
Was Successful Beyond His
Wildest Dreams.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 26.â Patrick
Joseph H. Percy Tynan, the alleged "no
torious No. 1," known in connection with
the Phoenix Park murders, who was ar
rested in Boulozne-Sur-Mer, France, st
the instigation of English detectives and
subsequently released, arrived here this
evening aboard the North German Lloyd
steamship Saale. It was a singular recep
tion he received at the steamship's dock.
His son, J. Brandon Tynan, went down
the bay on the revenue cutter Chandler to
meet his father, while his family, consist
ing of a wife and seven children, awaited
his arrival at the pier.
There was not an Irishman present to
welcome him back to his adopted country.
The many Hibernian societies sent no
representatives, and the American who
nearly sacrificed his life in enthusiasm for
Lis country and its cause for freedom,
found only his family ready to greet him.
It was, indeed, a hearty welcome they
gave him, and it was hard to believe, as
one watched him passionately kiss each of
the children that he could be guilty of the
awful crimes the English detectives have
tried to lay at his door.
No one has been able to divine just
what was Tynan's mission to Europe this
time, but an accident occurred on the
steamer during the voyage which seems
to give an inkling. The Saale had been
out three day? and Tynan's identity had
not been known. He spoke to few pas
sengers, was reserved ia his demeanor
nnd spent most of his time in mrvously
pacing the decks. At dinner on the third
day out he was sitting next to J. \V.
Beales of Boston. Mr. Beales did not
know who the man was, bui tried to draw
him into conversation, but Tynan had
little to say. Finally Mr. Beales blurted
out: "I say, do you know that we have
got the great dynamiter aboard?" Ty
nan's face flushed. He dropped his knife
and fork, and, looking Beales in the face,
acgrily replied: "I know of no dynamiter.
The only dynamiter I know is my friend
Lieutenant Zalinski, the dynamite manu
facturer; I have just been over here to
see him."
Mr. Beales attached no importance to
the remark at the time, but later asked
for an exchange of cards as a matter of
courtesy.
"I'll jiive him mine! when I leave the
ship," saiii Tynan. When Bea'.es learned
the name of hi 3 neighbor he felt some
what embarrassed, but talked no more
dynamite to him during the rest of the
voyage. What Tynan went to Europe to
see Zalinski for can only be conjectured.
Tynan when asKed about this conversa
jion at the dinner-table admitted part of
it as true, but denied saying that he was
U) Europe to see Zalinski. When a repre
sentative of the United Associate! Presses
boarded the Saale at quarantine Mr.
Tynan and his son were in the smoking
room engaged in earnest conversation.
He was a bit nervous in his manner as he
greeted the reporter. His appearance
showed he had just passed through a
trying ordeal.
"Will you explain your mission in
Europe?" as-ked the reporter.
"Ah,'' said the famous Irishman, his
face brightening up and his eyes dancing
merrily, "as to my mission I cannot now
talk, but I am p-oing to write a full state
ment, of the wnole affair in a few days foi
the friends of Ireland."
"Had it anything to do with dyna
mite?"
"No, it had not," replied Tynan, mildly.
"It was something of far greater im
portance than that."
"Was your mission successful ?"
"Yes, indeed," responded Tynan, in
joyous tones, "far beyond my wildest
dreams."
"It has been said that you believe in
the use of dynamite, is this true?"
"I believe," said Tynan in a slow and
measured voice, "in dynamite as George
Washington believed in gunpowder."
"What effect will your recent experience
have upon the Irish cause?"
'The cause I espouse is the cause of the
whole Irish nation. I will continue to
agitate it until it succeeds, or until I am
called to the far beyond.''
"Do you know anything about Ivory.
Kearney or Haine% who Scotland- Yard
says were mixe<i up with you in the al
leged conspiracy?"
"You mustexru3e me," replied Tynan.
"I cannot talk about that now. I will ex
plain all in my statement."
THE KILLED THREE INSCRED
Fatal Leap of a Lurrmt/e Horse Ocer an
ttitha nlcmrnt.
AMESBURY, Mass , Oct. 20.â An acci
dent occurred here by which one person
was instantly killed and three others
badly injured. Alfred H. Coombs, his
wife, a 10-year-old boy named Percy, who
lived with them, and another boy, a son
of Alfred Morrtll, starting from Coombs'
house to drive to Newton to attend church.
The horse took fright and sprang over
an embankment, tnrowinc; tuera out.
Mrs. Coomib' head, striking a tree, was
crushed into an unrecognizable mass
and her neck was broken. Mr. Coombs
was rendered unconscious and will prob
ably die. Tne Percy boy was injured in
ternally and has small chances of recov
ery. The Morrill boy was the least injured.
Coombs was one of the best-known farm
ers in this town.

WERE BROTHER AND SISTER.
Discovery That Prevented a Happy Couple
From Being Made Man
and Wife.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Oct. 26.â A wedding
announced for Sunday last at Dr. Hough
ton's "Little Church Around the Corner"
did not take place, because almost at the
last ruomeut the discovery was made that
the bridal couple to be were brother and
sister.
Fifteen years ago a man named Bryan
and his wife died in Chicago, leaving two
girlsâ Edna, aged 10, and Maude, five
years younger. Their only son, Joseph,
had run away from home a year previ
ously. The little girls were bright and
pretty, and Mrs. Alice Townsend, tho
wife of a variety-show manager, adopted
them.
In course of time they went on the stage
as the Harvey sisters, A year ago Edna
married a Mr. Melrose of Baltimore and
retired to private life. Maude went to
London, where she found employment at
the Alhambra. There she met Peggy
Prime and her husband, Joe Allen.
Maude and Joe Allen loved each other
at iirst sight. Miss Prime objected and
finally obtained a divorce. Allen and his
new love came to the United States in
tending to marry. They obtained work
with a company now playing in Brooklyn.
Miss Harvey announced her approaching
nuptials to all her friends. Mrs. Melrose
came from Baltimore to see her sister
married.
On Friday Allen entertained them with
stories of his early life. He told them he
ran away from his home in Chicago when
a lad of 10 years because his father beat
him, and had worked as a shoeblack,
nswsboy and other lowly occupations until
he rose and finally became a variety actor.
Mrs. Melrose asked him if he had seen
his parents since he became prosperous
and he replied that he had written to in
quire about them and had learned that
both ware dead.
"Their name wasn't Allen, you know,"
he said, "it was Bryan."
A few questions hurriedly put and
answered discovered to Mrs. Melrose that
in her intended brother-in-law she had
found a long lost brother. The invita
tions to the wedding were recalled and
Dr. Houghton was notified that his ser
vices would not be required.
FORTY MILLION ACRES.
Title to That Vast Tract of
Land Involved in a
Lawsuit.
Ths Coitest cf the Atlantic and Pacific
Against Mingus in the Su
preme Court.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 26.â The
tiUe to forty million acres of land is in
volved in a case pending in the Supreme
Court of the United States, wherein the
United States to-day asked leave to file a
briel because of its concern in the ques
tions presented. The title of the case is
the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Com
pany vs. Robert Mingus et al. lrom the
Supreme Court of the Territory of New
Mexico. The litigation was over tha title
to a tract of land situated within the lim
its of that part of the grant originally
made in 1866 to the Atlantic and Pacific
Railroad Company and declared to be for
feited to the United States by the act of
1866. because the road co-terminous there
with had net been constructed in accord
ance with the conditions of the grant.
The Supreme Court of the Territory at
firmed Min^us' title to the land and the
railroad company appealed to the Supreme
Court of thÂ« United States.
It is claimed by the railroad that by an
act passed in 1881, Congress expressly au
thorized the company to mortgage the
land grant, and that having been done
Congress could not forfeit the land at least
until afier the time when that mortgage
became due, which time has not yet ar
rived. Joseph Call, assistant counsel for
the United States, in his brief stated that
the land in question comprises all that
part of the grant lying between Isieta
Junction and Springfield, Mo., and be
tween the Colorado River and the Pacific
Ocean, forty out of the fifty million acres
contained in the original grant. If the
claims of the railroad company should be
sustained, all ot the patents issued by the
United States, and entries allowed to set
tlers for parts of such lands since 1886,
would be nulLfied. He contends that the
forfeiture act must bs upheld, and the
juilement of the Territorial Court, in favor
of Mingus' title, affirmed.
TRIAL OF THE MASSACHUSETTS
So Defects Found During the Cruise of
the Tiattleahip.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 2G â The
United States battleship Massachusetts,
just returned from her final tr a! trip, has
no superior in the world. Her perfor
mance on trial has exceeded that of the
Indiana. The report of the inspection
board, of which Commodore Dewey is
chairman, and which ran her ior forty
eight hours at sea last weeff, reached the
Navy Department to-day, un October 22
she ran thirteen knots by the log for two
hours, her engines averaging a little more
than 101 revolutions, developing 5014 horse
power. During the succeeding forty-eight
hours' run all gnns were fired on trie level
and at maximum elevation with service
charges, the structure of the ship and erun
mounts showing ample strength and free
dom from any injury or strains.
The board found that upon the trial no
weakness or defect appeared in the hull,
machinery, fittings or equipm- nt due to
defective workmanship or materials.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 26.â The
celebration of the semi-centennial anni
versary of the organization of the German
Cathoiic Church of St. Mary, Mother of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 27. 1896.
CHICAGO FATED
FOR BIG FIRES
In Less Than One Hour
Over a Million Goes
Up in Smoke.
Destruction of Elevators in the
Goose Island District in
Short Order.
PERIL OF THE FIRE LADDIES.
While Fighting the Flames They
Narrowly Escape a Terrible
Death.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 26.â 1n less than
one hour at noon to-day fire destroyed
$1,200,000 worth of property on the north
branch of the Chicago River, in a dilapi
tated locality known as Goose Island. The
Pacific grain elevators A and B, owned
by the Chicago and Pacific Elevator Com
pany, were completely destroyed and sev
eral frame dwellings adjoining were swept
away in the avalanche of flame. There
were more than 1,000.000 bushels of wheat
stored in the two great elevators. Tho
loss of that is estimated at $861,000, on corn
$34,800 and a small loss on oats. The loss
on the buildings and machinery is placed
at nearly $300,000. Insurance fully covers
the losses.
Superintendent Perry said the fire
started in elevator B in the south part,
and he believed it was caused Dy sparks
from a passing tug in the river. No em
ploye of the company knows anything
more definite about the origin of the de
struction.
No more dangerous spot for a big fire to
start could be found in the city. Close to
the burned structures are the Armour ele
vator, the biggest in the world, the im
mense building of Hale aud Curtis and
the extensive -JocKs and sheds of the Cres
cent Coal Company.
Burning brands from the cataract of
flaming grain and falling roofs and walls
ignited the roof of the malthouse every
few minutes and a djozen leads of hose
were needed to save the building froni de
struction. When the first of the twenty
five engine companies arrived on the
scene a water attack wa3 at once made on
the boiler-room, where the tire was re
ported to have started, but in a few min
utes the firemen were forced by blinding
steam and fierce heat to beat a hasty re
treat, leaving behind them part of their
hose equipment.
Five firemen of another company, who
were fighting the blaze from the roof of
the elevator office, a one-story brick build
ing, had a narrow escape from death. The
roof tney were on fell in by the building
catching fire underneath them and they
fell with it before a word of warning could
be given. Fortunately the firemen seized
the hose and the walls projecting a little
above the collapsed roof they hung over
the fiery furnace until rescued by their
comrades.
A hundred or more freight cars on the
Milwaukee and St. Paul road were rescued
from beneath the flaming pillars at the
peril of the railroad men who coupled the
cars, and then some had to be left.
INCENDIANRIAN AT CARNON
Third Attempt to Dentroy the Public
School Building.
CARSON, Nev., Oct 26.â An attempt
was made by an unknown person at 8
o'clock last evening to burn the public
school building, but the blaze was discov
ered in time, and by the prompt work of
the firemen the building was saved. The
incendiary entered a rear room by a win
dow, which was open, and built a small
fire in a corner, throwing kerosene on the
walls. This is the third attempt to burn
the building.
REPRIMANDED AND PROMOTED.
Viceroy Li Hung Chang Seems to Have

PEKING.CniNA.Oct. 26.â Li HungChang
has been reprimanded for having entered
the summer palace for the purpose of pay
ing a visit to the Dowager Empress with
out observing the formalities usual upon
sucn occasions.
LONDON, England, Oct. 26.â Telegrams
received here from Peking announce the
appointment of Li Hung Chang as Chi
nese Minister of Foreign Affairs. The an
nouncement has caused a great deal of
comment here.
The St. James Gazette says that Li
Hung Chang, upon leaving Southampton,
told the reporters that his ability to carry
out reforms which he desired established
in China depended upon his return to
power alter he got home. The success of
his mission to Europe is consequently
pauged by his appointment to the Foreign
Ministry.
WORKING THE WHEAT AT MARKET.
Business in th* Chicigo Pit on a Much
. Krduced Scale. .
CHICAGO. 111.. Oct. 20.â The net appre
ciation in the price of wheat to-day was 1
cent, but the market was nervous and in a
position to be "worked." Business was on
a much reduced scale, not only in wheat,
but in the other grains and provisions. In
a general way it was a bull market with
out ball news. '; -.! \-\ '','/.' . i â¢- V:- "'" : ;; ':}(
As is usual on r Monday the trade had
important ' statistics, but ; .they/ did not
leave I their } mark. < There was ; a disposi
tion to follow leaders or guess what the
market might do next regardless of nat
ural influences, and this developed a scalp
ing trade. 7 ::'-; ' â _ '/â â  â  ':-. .' â ;â â¢ â '"
: The December options in wheat opened
at 69% cents and the highest price for the
day s was ' ~\% â¢ cents. â  The lowest figures
were 69}^ cents. Shortly before the clos
ing; hour news came of the burning of I the
Pacific elevators and this caused the mar
ket to be firm, the final price being

'.' It cannot be said that there was any ex
citement during [ the days business, for
the reason,* perhaps, that there was noth
ing in the information received to warrant
it. The foreign cable reports indicated a

fect in the bear campaign, . but altogether
it was simply a scalping movement.

NEW ORLEANS, La., Oct. 26.â The ex

CALIFORNIA'S MOHAIR FLEECE.
Stir Caused in London by the Exhibit of
C. P. Bailey of San
Jose.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 26â The
Times says: A stir has been caused in Eng
land by some mohair fleece grown in Cali
fornia, and it is stated that if fleeces of the
same uniform quality can be grown there
in any amount the triumph of the United
States as a mohair producer will be as
sured. United States Consul Meeker at
Bradford, Yorkshire, England, writes on
this point as follows:
"There has been on exhibition at this
Consulate for the past week an American
grown mohair fleece forwarded to Brad
ford by C. P. Bailey of San Jose, Cal. The
fleece is that of a two-year-old graded doe.
The quality of the hair has been the won
der of all who have seen it. It has been
closely examined by several of the leading
mohair dealers and importers, all of whom
have expressed the highest opinion of it.
"One of them, Jonas Whitley, ex-Mayor
of Bradford, said: 'I have now in my
warehouse about $200,000 worth of mohair,
both Turkey and Cape, and I am entirely
sincere when I state that there is not a
better fleece in the lot. I will buy all the
American mohair like that that may be
offered me at the market price. Should
it uniformly equal this fleece I do not
know but what I would pay more than
the market price. It is remarkable in
being most free from kemp, and I do not
know that I have ever handled a fleece
with so little kemp in it. The amount of
noils is also less than usual, which is very
important, as it leaves more weight in
long staple to go into tops. I say unhesi
tatingly that the sample fleece is as good
mohair as is grown.' "
NEEDED FOR THE NAVY
Sixty-Nine Million Dollars the
Estimate ior Building and
Arming Vessels.
Seme Interesting F.gures Are Sub
mitted by the Naval Ordnance
Bureau.
Washington, d. c, Oct. 26.-Tne
Naval Ordnance Bureau requires over
$69,000,000 next year, of which $7,722,796 is
needed for the armament of new vessels
already authorized. The annual report of
Comi/iodore Sampson, chief of ordnance,
shows seventy-one big breech-loading
rifles have been completed this year, and
that more than half of the required
smaller guns are now in use. The diffi
culty of securing a proper brown prismatic
powder is shown by the fact that while
699,847 were accepted last year, 835,700
were rejected. Efforts have therefore been
increased to perfect smokeless powder
manufacture. Powder contractors have
delivered over 2000 tons of plates up to
October 1, of which 1705 tons were Har
veyized. Tne average cost per ton, which
in 1895 was $611 26, was this year $551 72.
Notice is taken ot the first foreign orders
for armor ever placed in this country,
Russia having contracted with the Carne
gie and Bethlehem works for 1000 and 3000
tons respectively.
In referring to the delivery of the new
small arm, of which 10,000 have been or
dered, the very small caliber of which has
been criticized, Commodore Sampson de
clares that "at the present moment no na
tion having any pretensions to military or
naval power has in contemplation any
other change in the culiber of its small
arms than a still further reduction."
The navy now has 112 Whitehead tor
pedoes in use â 186 more being held in re
serve for new ships aud torpedo-boats.
All the six-inch rifles in the service are
being changod to rapid-fire weapons.
As instancing the remarkable prompt
ness with which vessels on the home sta
tion can have their explosive stores re
plenished it is said that the Stiletto left
Newport one morning and delivered 4000
pounds of smokeless powder to Fort
Wads worth, N. V., and South Am boy,
N. J., within twelve hours. The bureau
has ordered 1,000,000 rounds of ammuni
tion for the new small arm.

Fiendish Cruelties Practiced
in the Massacre
at Egin.
Large Numbers of the Bodies of
Victims Cast Into the
Euphrates.
CHRISTIAN HOMES DESTROYED
No Kurds in the Place and So the
Sultan's Own People Must
Shoulder the Blame.
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 26.â A letter dated
Harpoot, Eastern Turkey, September 29,
has been received in Boston as follows:
"All the letters which I have sent agree
in fixing the estimate at about 2000 as the
number killed in the Egln massacre.
"More women and children in propor
tion seem to have suffered this fate than
in any previous massacre of which I know.
Many of the dead were left in the streets
for days as food for dogs and large num
bers were thrown into the Euphrates.
"The bodies h&ve been seen floating
dowji the river forty or fifty miles below
the city. In some cases whole families
have been obliterated. Exact statistics, of
course, cannot be given, but it is feared
that 2000 is an underestimate. There is
an estimated population of between 5000
and 6000 Christians."
The letters give the number of houses
at 1100, and of these it is &aiu only about
150 are left. This carnage lasted from
Tuesday to Thursday. All the testimony
concurs in showing that the massacre was
official and that it was wholly without
reason. There was no disturbing element
except in the cases of a few officials.
"The Vali," continues the letter, "and
the military commander were in the tele
grapti office here most of the time from
the beginning to the end. As far as I can
learn, the people made no resistance
whatever and no Turks were killed except
three possibly later in the division of the
spoils. There were no Kurds in the place.
The work was done by the citizens and
soldiers. The massacre has extended to
several of the Egin villages, but we have
no details.
"The local government is constant in its
assurance that no further massacres will
take place in this region, and a good deal
of energy is shown in restraining the tur
bulent elements. Five people were killed
in the Aghum villages, one of them a
priest, but the timely arrival of soldiers
prevented another massacre. After all
that has happened it is not surprising
that Christians have no sense of security
and that they are unnerved by lear. The
destitution of the coming winter threat
ens to be almost as great as last year."
BURIAL OF THE BODIES
Health Worries Turkey More Than Cruel
acres.
WASHINGTON, D. C, OcL 26.â A let
ter from '. S. G. Zayatizino, , United States
Sanitary Inspector nt Constantinople, ad
dressed to Surgeon-General Wyman of the
Marine Hospital service, eiyes a striking
idea of the recent massacres in that city.
He writes:
'â  A commission has been appointed in
consequence of an irade or imperial order,
the mission of which commission was to
ascertain if the corpses of the massacred
people have been buried according to the
rules of hygiene and have not endangered'
public health. The above-mentioned com- !
mission, the members of which are mostly
members of the International Board of
Health, have visited the Armenian.ceme
tery at Shisley, where they saw three large
graves, one of which was forty-five by five
meters and nearly two meters deep. The
two other graves were smaller, about eight
by three meters each, where several hun- i
dred corpses were buried.
' The , above-mentioned * commission has
not visited the other Armenian cemeteries
of Constantinople, where the massacred"
people have been burled. : :
"In a'sitting of the sanitary commission
the question whether ; the prison will not
endanger the public health of the capital
was discussed. It has been said, for I in
stance, that the , arrested ' Armenians : are
so many and so : thronged '<â  in the prisons
that the poor prisoners are obliged to stay
on foot all; the time they are in prison,
being unable to lie down on account of
the lack of room. I will be aole to state
the sanitary condition of the prisons after
the commission presents ; its report. ;If
what has been said is true such a condi
tion may cause the outbreak of infectious
diseases.; ; There are already . several cases
of , typhoid ': fever, but every year , at this
season this disease exists. What a physi
cian can ' see ' now are frightened patients
suffering from the effects of what they r
saw during the 26th and 28th of last Au
gust, when all along the streets of Galata
men armed with swords were ' striking liv
ing men or .' dead bodies, a dreadful ' and
terrific sight." "..' '"_*.- ' â >

NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 26.â Carnegie
Hall was filled to-nighi by 4000 persons
who attended the welcome meeting to the
Armenian refugees, held under the
auspices of the ' Woman's Christian
Temperance Union, the National Ar

Army. The Salvationists turned out in
force. Commander Booth-Tucker pre
sided in the absence of Rev. T. De Witt

were Dr. Grace Kirnball, Ira Sankey, Con
sul Mrs. Booth-Tucker and about fifty of
the refugees.
Letters of regret from Mayor Strong,
Right Rev. Bishop Satterlie and others,
and a cablegram from Mr. Gladstone to
Dr. Talmage were read. The cablegram
was as follows:
I rejoice in the rescue of any faction of tha
Armenians from the fangs of the great assas
sin. So long as the inaction of the powers
continues the situation will be shameful as
we'l as sud, but the deeds are recorded both in

HATRED FOR BARTHOLOMEW.
Armenians Object to His Subservience to
the â¢Sitltf.n.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Oct. 26.â
While Monsignor Bartholomew, who on
August 9 last was selected as locum
tenens of the Armenian patriarch, Mat
thew Izmirdian, was driving through the
streets to-day he was attacked by iour
men who attempted to murder him. The
escort accompanying Monsignor Barthol
mew seized the would-be assassins and
turned them over to the police. An- ex
amination elicited the fact that one of the
prisoners was an Armenian officer.
Monsignor Bartholomew has excited the
hostility ol the Armenians by his subser
vience to the Sultan, and the attempt to
murder him is undoubtedly due to this
feeling. He is highly esteemed by the
Turks for his Mohammedan sympathies.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Oct. 26â
The members of two Armenian families
have been arrested here on the charge of
having been implicated in the attempt of
the Armenian revolutionists to secure the
payment of tribute by an Armenian
lawyer named Cololan. The latter made
a rendezvous with the men who made the
demand upon him and then informed the
police of the facts.
Two policemen went to the rendezvous,
when the Armenians set upon them and
stabbed both of them. The arrest of the
Armenians on various charges continues.
It is rumored that a large seizure of bombs
was made at Petraya.
CARNAGE IN FAIR CUBA.
Engagements Between Insurgents and
Spanish in Which Many Soldiers
Are Slain.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 26â Coionel Se
gura has reported to the Government that
bis command surprised a body of
rebels at Garganta Soroa, province ol
Pinar del Rio, and that in the
righting that followed four of the
insurgents were killed. The Spanish by
this victory gained possession of a route
to the hills and started to buiid trenches
to defend their position. While employed
in this work the troops were continually
fired upon by rebels, but no losses wera
sustained.
On October 24 Colonol Segura left the
main body of his command, and with a
small force started to reconnoitre the
country. On his way back he learned that
the Seamore battalion was engaged with
the rebels. He therefore hurried to tha
scene of the fighting and took part in the
combat.
The rebels made desperate efforts to
carry the Suanish position and thus open
the way for their return to the hills, but
they were compelled to retreat, closely
followed by the Spaniards. A series of
bloody fights occurred during the two
days of the pursuit.
The rebels left sixty-one dead on tha
field, but it is said that their losses were
much heavier than this. The troops lost
a lieutenant and twenty-one privates
killed, and 110 wounded, including foul
captains and two lieutenants.

THE CAMPAIGN
IN CALIFORNIA
Kern County Republicans
in Mass- Meeting at
Bakersfield.
Financial and Tariff Questions
Discussed by a Trio of
Orators.
'â¢ SEED DAY" AT LOS ANGELES.
All Southern California Will Greet
Maine's Favorite Son
To-Day.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Oct 26.â One of
the best meetings of the campaign wae
held here this afternoon by the Repub
licans. The Democrats had a meeting
billed for to-day as well, and in order not
to conflict the Republicans held theirs in
the afternoon. It was an open-air meet
ing and was largely attended. General
Chipman, Colonel Eddy and J. C. Camp
bell were the speakers.
General Chipman was first introduced,
and began by referring to the fruit indus
try of this State and the evil effects of
Democratic tariff legislation upon it. He
discussed the silver question, showing that
the value of the silver dollar of Mexico
was but half that of an American dollar,
and saying that it was the intention of the
Democrats to turn out an irredeemable
silver dollar worth no more than the
Mexican. The speaker contended tnat
silver was only a commodity, its value be
ing subject to the same laws as other com
modities, rising or falling with the in
crease or decrease of production.
The general went into the history of
the American coinage system, showing
how the ratio between silver and gold had
beep changed by law in order to equalize
the commercial and the coinage values.
In 1858 a law was passed taking away the
legal tender quality of silver, except in
amounts of $5 or Less. He defended the
act of 1873 and denied that it had been
clandestinely passed. -It was before Con
gress for three years, and its purpose was
known to every one. No complaint was
made until the product of silver increased
to such an extent that the miners had' to
find a new market for their metal. Free
coinage, he said, would put no more
money in circulation than there was now.
What was wanted was confidence. It was
untrue that the fall in silver was the
cause of the fall in wheat and other com
modities. That fall was due to over
production and to the law of supply and
demand. â¢
The next speaker, J. G. Campbell, be
gan by saying that he believed Americans (
had too much politics and not enough
patriotism. He had great faith in the
good, hard, common-sense of the Ameri
can people. He was a Republican because
he believed that the Republican party was
in the right and he was proud to belong to
the party of honest Abraham Lincoln and
tnat peerless statesman, James G. Biaine.
The speaker likened the temptation of the
people by the apple of tariff reform to that
of Eve by the snake, with like disastrous
results.
The loudest applause was bestowed upon
his reference to foreign immigration and
its suppression, something to whicn the
Republican party is pledged.
"After American people are provided for
wili be time enough," he said, 'to let any
more foreigners come in."
Colonel Eddy said he believed that the
people had made up their minds and it
was too late to change them Dy discussing
the general issues. He believed that the
people could be depended upon to do tbeir
duty with fair-mindedness and intelli
gence. The only question was: VVhich
of the candidates could be best trusted to
fill the highest position in the gift of the
American people. He challenged Mr.
Waterhouse. tne Populist who was to
have spoken to-night, to tell how free
coinage was to start the factories of this
country.
Colonel Eddy said that he would not
accuse Bryan of being an anarchist, but
he was treading very close to the line.
MRS. CATT AT STANFORD.
Reviews the Struggle of Woman for Her
Common Rightsâ Dr. Jordan Favors
Equal Suffrage.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
26.â Mrs. Carrie Chapman-Catt of New
York City delivered a lecture on "Equal
Suffrage" to-day in the chapel. The audi
ence, which comfortably filled the chapel,
was composed mostly of women, but
twenty men being present. Dr. Jordan,
in introducing the speaker, said: \
"I propose to put myself on record as
being thoroughly in favor ol equal suf
frage. I have often expressed my views
on the subject, although, perhaps, I have
never made any formal declaration to that
effect."
Mrs. Catt pointed out the great law of
progress which has been uplifting human
ity since the birth of man.
"The movement for woman's suffrage
had its beginning in the fourth century,"
she said. "At that time a council was
called. The wisest men of all Europe at
tended. Among the many questions dis
cussed by this broad-minded assembly was
one which now seems ridiculous. It was
simply this: Whether a woman ought to
possess a soul. Up to this time men were
the only ones, according to the popular
belief, who had a right to salvation.
Simple as this question was there arose
violent opposition to the extension of the
right of salvation, It was decided that if
woman thought as ber husband thought
she could be saved.
"In the eighth century a woman whose
husband bad died married aze.in. She
found that husbands believed differently,
even on the same subjects. The only
course left to her was to get her Bible and
learn to read for herself the laws in regard
to salvation. This sbe aid, and others
followed her example. The contaeion
spread. Another council was called to
decide whether women ought to learn to
read. A small majority decided in their
favor. The great law of evolution de
manded it, and thus it was that women
became thinking human beings."
Mrs. Catt showed how the right of bal
lot, freedom of thought and speech, as
well as independence in religious affairs,
were obtained in the eighteenth century.
This century she characterized as "the
age of men," in contrast to the nineteenth
century, "the age of women." She
pointed out the many obstacles the move
ment for equal rights had overcome dur
ing the present century.
Mrs. Catt closed by strongly urging the
young women of the audience to seek the
ballot as a great blessing. The young
men of the audieneo were urgea to favor
the movement in the coming election.

ENTITLED TO HIS FOTE.
Ruling in the Case of a Lick Astronomer
Who Did Rot Register.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. Professor
John N. Schaberle, an astronomer at the
Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton, to
day secured an order from Judge Reynolds
directing County Clerk Ptister to place his
name upon, the new great register. Pro
fessor Schaberbe on the witness - stand
testified that he was an astronomer m the
employ of the Lick Observatory, and, un
der orders from the Board of Regents of
the State University, sailed for Japan on
May 28 in the expedition sent to take ob
servation of the total eclipse of the sun on
August 9. He remained away in that
capacity until September 30, and on his
return it was too late for him to . register.
After securing the opinion of District
Attorney Herrington, D. M. Delmas and
Attorneys Bowdea and Spencer, counsel
in the Parker will case, ; Judge Reynolds
I decided that Professor Schaberle was en
titled to vote and directed the County
Clerk to place his. name upon the great
register. In ruling upon the matter the
court said - .
It seems tome that the Regents of the State
University had a right ,to send an employe
abroad. Because he could not return in time
for the registration was not a voluntary act of
his. It was his duty. The State cannot author
ize the registration as stated and then author
ize its officers to go .; abroad and thereby be
excluded from the right of registration. The
authorization of the registration to be com
menced and closed during his absence would
be so far unconstitutional .as applied to that
citizen. .
County Clerk Pfister at once obeyed the
order and the matter will not De appealed.

night for holding the biggest parades and
demonstrations of the campaign. The
Republicans originally decided upon Fri
day and the Silvcrites upon the following
day. Later the McKinleyites changed the
date to Saturday. Since then the Bryan
men became more and more indignant,
and to-daythey sent a committee to the
Republicans offering to abandon their
parade if the latter would do the same,
but the Republicans, knowing they would
make the best showing, refused. The Sil

VOLLEYS OF THTTNDEB - PEALS.
Narrow Escape of a Rancher From
the Falling Timbers of His
v Home.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. 26.â The wild
est storm ever experienced in this section
commenced at 6 o'clock last night and
lasted about two hours. Thunder rolled
and volleyed and sheets of lightning
lighted up the heavens. The wind
amounted to a gale and rain fell in sheets.
At one time an immense ball of fire de
scended from the heavens with an explo
sion that terrified all who heard it. Upon
investigation this morning it was found
to have struck on the Brush place east of
the city, where it demolished a large oak
tree and rtade a large hole in the ground.
The storm was felt the most severely
about eight miles west of this place, along
the .uaguna de Santa Rosa. At this point
many dwelling-houses and barns were
moved bodily from their foundations and
a grove of mammoth oak trees prostrated.
C. D. Laporte's house, barn and outbuild
ings were completely wrecked and the
timbers scattered. William Pattison's
new house was unroofed and the roof car
ried away, leaving the inmates at the
mercy of the elements. Mr. Pattison was
sick in bed at the time and had a narrow
escape from the falling timbers.
In this city a few smokestacks and
chimneys were blown down, many win
dows were broken and a lew shade aud
ornamental trees destroyed. A tree and
a telephone pole fell across the track of
the Donahue Railroad Hue, but were re
moved in time to allow the late train to
pass. At 8 o'clock at night Use storm sud
denly ceased, and in a few moments the
stars were shining brightly.
About an inch and a half of rain has
fallen to-day and it is raining heavily to
night, with good prospects for an all
night downpour. It causes general satis
faction among farmers, and will injure
only a few late grapes.
NAPA, Cal., Oct. 26.â Rain fell in tor
rents here to-day, accompanied by heavy
gusts of wind. The storm will ruin that
part of the grape crop now on the vines.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 26.â 1t has been
showering all the afternoon, and indica
tions point to a heavy rain. Nearly two
inches have fallen this season.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 26.â Tbe rainfall
ol last night and to-day amounted to less
than .25 of an inch. No damage is antici
pated even if the storm continues.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., Oct. 26.â 1t
has been raining here since about 4 o'clock
this afternoon, and bids fair to continue
throughout the night.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Oct. 26.â A slight
rainfall set in at 9:45 o'clock to-night and
soon increased to a steady downpour. It
continued without cessation aud at mid
night there was no sign of a let up.
RELIANCE VS. STANFORD.
Oakland and Varsity Football Teams
Vill Meet on Wednes&iy.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
26. â Notwithstanding the rain, which set
in here to-day in dead earnest, the foot
ball men, led by Captain Fickert, donned
their football suits and wallowed around
after the slipnery pigskin in mud aoove
their ankles. Captain Fickert says that
rain is not to interfere with practice, even
if the men have to take to bathing suits
in order to play.
The management has arranged to have
the Reliance team come down Wednesday
to play the Varsity men In order to give
them extra practice. Fickert is still un
satisfied with the speed of the men in their
play, and he is desirous that they play a
more snappy game.
Freshmen are planning to do some
steady practicing from now on, and if all
the men who have signiried their inten
tion of playing appear a very creditable
team should be formed. Up to this time
there has appeared little or no desire or
interest on the part of the men to make
the team efficient. There has been very
little real team practice, and Berkeley,
with her well-trained freshmen, who are
known to have developed considerable
team work under Butterworth's special
coaching, is sure to defeat the local
freshman team unless there is an imme
diate change in the direction of more
team practice.

One of the Animal's Long
Horns.
NOGALES, Ariz., Oct. 26.â A bullfight
with fatal results occurred at Nogaies,
Sonora, yesterday, and for a short time
caused a panic in the audience. One of
the bulis, becoming more enraged than
usual at these rather tame fights, ranted
about the arena, goring everything within
its reach.
A horse was disemboweled. A picador,
Jose Angulo. in an attempt to place a
thorn in the side of the wild animal, was
caught on one of its long horns, which
pierced him like a sword. He was tossed
and fell to the ground, bleeding and man
gled, where the beast held him between
his horns and pawed him. He was fright
fully injured and died a few minutes later.
There was intense excitement in the
audience, and at one time it was on the
verge of a panic, but was quieted by the
killing of the bull.

SUISUN, Cat., Oct. 26.â George Rocks
â¢berry of Benicia can bless his stars that
'he is now in the land of the living.
â¢ R.ocksnury and several friends who re
side in Benicia concluded recently that a
few weeks' outinsr in the marshes of
Solano Ccunty west of Suisun woulJ ma
terially improve their health, and after
â¢procuring guns and ammunition they
let sail in a pleasure-yacht for the
â¢great duck-shooting swamp*. The sporis
'inen anchored in Cordelia Slough,
within 100 3'ards of the barricade
â¢/hat was erected this year by the Cordelia
Gun Ciub at the mouth of the Frank
Horan Slough. Rocksberry was aware of
the fact that gamekeepers were detailed
on the marshes to prevent all persons ex
cepting members of the "preserve" clubs
from shooting thereorj, but as the courts
have not as yet permanently decided the
right of gun clubs to debar so-called
poachers from shooting wild ducks upon
the swamp and overflowed lands in the
vicinity of Suisun he and his companions
concluded that they had a perfect right to
the enjoyment of a pastime that the Su
perior Court of Solano County adjudged
should be free to all American citizens.
A fe*v evenings ago Roeksberrj, F.
Tobelman and J. Unger of San Francisco
were shooting over what is commonly
known as the Taylor pond, distant about
300 yards from the railroad track, near
Teal" Station, when a bullet splashed the
water within a foot of where Tobelman
was standing. Rocksberry was in his
boat at the time he heard the crack of a
rifle, and looking in the direction whence
the report came he saw a man standing
on the railroad track with a rifle to his
shoulder. The sportsman shouted to the
rifleman, who wa* evidently bent on
murdering somebody, and the echo of hi 3
voice hau scarcely died away when a
bullet went crashing through the craft in
which Rocksberry was seaieil. Seven
shots were fired by the alleged Teal Club's
faithful officer, but fortunately the only
damage done was the puncturing of the
'boat and the cutting of a small piece of
rubber from the top of one of Mr. Rocks
berry's boots.
The hunters quickly concluded that it
was about time for them to decamp, as
they were not mepared 10 return the sa
lute, not being armed with rifle 3.
"This outrageous means of keeping so
called trespassers off the lands," said Vic
tor Harriet of Benicin to-day, "has beeu
severely commented upon by the sports
men and residents of Solano County, and
it has been openly slated by the hunters
tbat unless the keepers discontinue the
use of rifles somebody will get hurt.
Threats have been made by the so-called
) oachers tiiat they will return the fire of
the enemy in case another attempt at
niankilling is made."
"It must be said with all due respect to
the keepers," said Mr. Myrtle, who was
one of the party of hunters shooting on
the Tartar pond at the time of the unex
pected attack, "that with a few excep
tions they are fair-minded fellows, who
must, of course, obey instructions, but, as
the case stands at present, the clubs have
no leeal right or authority to prevent by
threat or force of arms any sportsman
from shooting wild game on the Suisun
marshes."
D. McÃae and a friend bagged 125 docks
-7-principaily mallard, widgeon, spri? and
teal â last Sunday on trie Teal Club
grounds. John K. Orr, who was for sev
eral years a noted professional quuil
liunter, bagged a fairly good mess of ducks
on the Ibis Club grounds. Messrs. Hamil
ton, McAllister and Tubbs had tolerably
good success. Mr. Gerberof Sacramento
shot over the Taylor ponds and scored a
nice bag of birds. The present rain
storm will very materially improve the
sport of duck and quail shooting, and the
hunters expect excellent results on Satur
day and Sunday next.

LOS ANGELES' FAIR FOOTPAD.
â Pasadena Citizens Are Boldly Held Up
and Robbed by a
Woman.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 26.â A woman
lootpad is a rarity in these parts, but |
if a stcry told to the local authorities by
V v . B. Thompson of Pasadena can be relied
upon there is one such interesting person
age in Los Angeles â or, rather, she was
"here last nLht. The "lady footpad" had
â¢an accomplice in the person of a horrid
man. The Pasadenan lost $60, but he is a
â¢wiser if a less moneyed man.
The foodpadery occurred at the corner
of tfcj'd and Omar streets. Thompson
s-ays he was standing on the sidewalk
when a handsome, well-dressed woman
.stepped up and engaged him in conversa
tion. Suddenly she threw her arms around
him, pinioning his arms to his ;ides. At
tlm her companion appeared, and while
'Thompson struggled wiih the woman he
searched the Pasadena man's pockets.
'! ne female crook seemed possessed of pro
.digiou* strength, and Thompson could not
Iree himself.
After the robbery Thompson says the
'couple bucked off and dodaed behind
â¢some castor-bean bushes near the walk.
" Tue victim then went to a friend's
house, reported the hold-up and a party
was organized to hunt for the footpads,
but after an hour's search the chase was
abandoned. The effair was then reported
to the polite. During this time the two
had ample opportunity to escape.

THE TWO LEPERS RETAKEN
Bindt Brothers Seen on Market
Street and Piaced Under
Arrest.
They Declare That on No Account
Will Taey Be Removed to the
City and County HospiUl
Ernest Bindt and FranK Bindt. the {wo
lepers who escaped from the Pesthouse
last Thursday night, were captured yes
terday afternoon and are now back in
their old quarters.
Since their escape the police have been
keeping a careful lookout for them, and
accurate descriptions of them had been
read to the watches at the different police
stations.
Yesterday afternoon, between 3 and 4
o'clock, Watchman Popper of the Pest
house was walking along the south side of
Market street, between Fifth and Sixth,
when he saw the two brothers ieaving the
building, 927 Market street.
Popper followed behind tbem till he
met Policemen Morrissey and Murphy.
He pointed out the two lepers to the offi
cers, and they were promptly placed under
arrest and taken to the Keceivim Hos
pital. When searched a revolver was
lound on each. The Pe3thonsa was at
once notified, and the brothers were taken
out in the van.
After escaping from the Pesthouse they
made their way downtown and engaged
a room at 455 Tehama street. The occu
pants of the house did not know that they
were harboring lepers, and as they paid a
week's rent in advance, were well drssred
and appeared to have plenty of money no
particular inquiries were made about
them.
Both brothers are intelligent men.
When dressed they do not have much the
appearance of lepers, except in their
hands, which are contracted and cannot
be closed.
"We have been in the Pesthouse for ten
years," said Ernest, "and were perfectly
happy and contented there. We had a
brother there, also, but come years ago be
was discharged as cured.
"We have our separate rooms there,
have good food and plenty of .Â«t;ace for
recreation, and are perfectly willing to re
main there. We are practically consigned
to a living death, and common humanity
should plead for us to make our lives as
pleasant as possible, which is done at the
Pcs: house.
"We will not go to the City and County
Hospital upon any consideration. The
food is bad there and we would all be con
fined in one ward without the opportunity
of exercising ourseives. It is bad enough
at the Pesthouse with some of the Chinese J
there, but it would be a thousand times j
worse at the City and County Hospital, j
where we would be iv one wani. All the j
lepers are just cs much opposed as we are I
to being removed to the hospital, and
those who are able will make their escape
if our removal is insisted upon. Another
leper was to ko with us last Thursday
evening, but he drank too much wine and
was unable to leave.
"The revolvers we had with us were
these we used in amusing ourselves at the
Pesthouse by tiring at a target, and we
tooK them with us, not for any deadly
purpose, but just to have them.
"The Goto remedy has done us good,
but if we are cooped up in a ward at the
hospital it will be of no benefit."
A MONSTER ENGINE.
The "Pride of the System" Now in
Operation at the Bryant-
Avenue Carhouse.
An engine has just been placed in posi
tion at the Bryant-avenue carhouse, cor
ner of Eleventh and Shannon streets, that
is called the "pride of the Market-street
system." It has been in process of con
struction at the Union Iron Works for the
last six months, and about one month
was required to place it in its present posi
tion. The engine ii considered one of the
finest pieces of â¢ mechanical work ever
turned out by the Union Iron Works.
The big engine is used for driving two
railway generators of 400 kilowatts each,
and: is itself of 1400 horsepower. One of
its peculiarities marking the improvement
of the time in mechanics is that the en
gine possesses no fly-wheels, but governs
trom the high-pressure cv Under alone. It
is pronounced : by C.'J.Kaiglin, ".'chief su
perintendent engineer of ; motive power of
the Market-street system, to be a marvel.

TAKEN LITERALLY.
She Went and " Soaked Her Head " as
Told.
"Apropos of slang," said the man from
the Hub to the Detroit Free Press re
porter, "you all know, for it is a matter of
history, that we, the people of Boston,
speak a purely classic language, and much
fun is made at our expense by would-be
wits on that account. But when I lived
West with my family for a few years I I
acquired the pernicious habit of using '
slang. Strange to say, I learned it from j
hearing my own boys, who were so capti- i
vated by it that years of Harvard have
not eradicated it."
Everybody looked sufficiently impressed
and he resumed :
"We had a new hired girl, a child of
nature if there ever was one, ani my wife
was much distressed by her antics. ' 1 did
not interfere, as it was an unwritten law
in the family that none of its male mem
bers should give orders to the help. And
it was seldom that I ever knew the name
of the reigning goddess of the kitchen.
"But the boys were proof against the
simplicity of this one. They poked fun
at her, sent her fool's errands and ex
plained things backward until the poor
girl's scant allowance of brains became
completely befuddled. So I was not sur
prised when I found her waiting in the
hall for me to ask me what time the 7
o'clock traiu left for Mills village. I knew
the boys had been guying her.
"I looked at her simple, moonlike face,
her shock of wild hair, and quoting the
latest phrase I had heard on the lips of
my boys. I motioned her away. 'Go and
soak your head,' I remarKed.
"When I came home that night, my wife
informed me that the cellar wss flooded
and the girl half-drowned. She had taken
me literally, but I assure you, gentlemen,
she has cured me of using slang."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1896.
CANADA'S FLOOD
OF BOGUS COIN
Officials Alarmed by the
Activity of Chinese
Counterfeiters.
Thousands of Half-Dollars Put
Into Circulation at
Vancouver.
ALMOST PERFECT IN DESIGN.
Detected Only When Examined
Through Powerful Magnify
ing Glasses.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 26.â Since the
discovery was made recently that Chinese
counterfeiters were shipping' bogus Cana
dian half dollars to iVancouver, where
t^ey were put into circulation, the Do-
JRnion authorities have discovered that
the Mongolians have been operating on so
extensive a scale as to cause the gravest
alarm. An attempt is evidently being
made to dump upon the Canadian market
immense consignments of counterfeit
coin made by these Oriental counterfeiters,
who are adepts in their production. It
has been ascertained that 20,000 bogus half
dollars arrived on a recent Oriental
steamer and were passed by the port au
thorities under the impression that they
were genuine coin of the realm. It ap
pears that as yet no information can be
obtained as to the whereabouts of the real
consignor or consignees. The false circu
lating medium, once obtained by the coun
terfeiter's agents, was launched indiscrim
inately upon the Vancouver market and
received by every one in trade until it
reached the banks. Here the date of the
coin (1894) was noticed by the teller of
the Bank of British Columbia and,
as the Dominion Government had is
sued no coin bearing tbat date, a minute
examination wes made with a powerful
magnifying in comparison with a genuine
coin.
It was found that the interstices of the
milling in the false coin are wider thnn
those of the real. The lettering about the
Queen's head is not so clearly defined In
the Chinese as in the Canadian coin. The
bogus coin is a shade heavier in weight;
in other respects there is practically no
noticeable difference.
It is estimated by assayers that the
Chinese production contains 48 per cent
pure silver. With so handsome a margin
and such an excellent imitation the coun
feiters will not likely restcontent with the
profit on one issue of their goods.
This consignment from the Orient re
ceives special significance when taken in
conjunction with the following recently
published statement of Edward Atkinson,
the eminent writer on economic and finan
cial questions, who says:
When I was in London a few years ago I
he&rd a rumor that measures w.>re being taken
to make <tles exactly corresponding to tlie
stamp of our standard United States dollars,
which were to be sent to China to be used in
converting United States trade dollars and
Mexican dollars into standard dollars.
It v.as said that this could be
done only at the expense of coining
the silver being already ussayed.and alloyed,
and each dollar weigning 82 grains more
than our standerd dollar. It was said that
these coins could be sent through Mexico,
British Columbia and the Sandwich Islands
from China in sufficiently large quantities lo
make It a very profitable business. I was un
able to trace this rumor to Its source and have
never seen any evidence that it had been car-
r ried into effec. But how could that evidence
be obtained? We know that there are only
about (50,000, 000 standard dollars of our owu
coinage In circulation. How do we know that
there are not any more of exactly the same
weight and quality, carrying me same identi
cal stamp, which have been made (or us iv
China and Japan, or in Mexico, where the
profit would be nearly 50 per cent? How long
will it be before such apian is worked on a
very extensive scale, even If It has not yet
been worked?
AT THE CITY THEATERS,
Julia Marlowe Taber Makes a
Success as Juliet at the
Baldwin.
Second Edition of "Babss la the
Wood"â Progratnm? of the Press
C ub Bine fit.
A large audience braved the weather
last night and showed its appreciation for
the Tabers and for William Shakespeare,
by attending the performance of "Romeo
and Juliet" at the Baldwin Theater. En
thusiasm met its reward, for in many
respects the performance was as ideal a
one as a blase critic or a hardened first
nighter could wish to ses.
It is hard to speak in calm terms of
Julia Marlowe Taher's Juliet. She seemed
to enter into the very core of the lovesick
Capulet girl's personality. The intense
youthful passion, the honesty, the win
someness, the agony and the despair of
Juliet were all portrayed with a fidelity to
life which was almost startling.
So few actresses arnve at the maturity
of powers necessary for acting Juliet
while they are young enough to look the
part; but Julia Marlowe Taber, a slim,
girlish ligure, in her loose, flowing roltes,
showed the full maturity oi a finished
artist in her acting.
â  Another point where she scored heavily
was that she showed herself capable of
touching every phase of Juliet's emotion
with equal ease and nicety. So often
actresses who succeed in the tenderness
of the balcony scene fail in the tragedy oJ
the potion scene.
Ellen Terry, for instance, altogether
fascinating as she is in the earlier
portions of the play, invariably falls
short of her previous efforts when it comes
to the potion scene. This was where Julia
Marlowe Taber, in her alternations be
tween girlish couragH ana horror, was
strongest. At tha end of this scene she
was culled again and again before the cur
tain.
Robert Tabor's Romeo deserves much
more than a passing notice. He was the
ardent, youthful lover to the life, and he
looked as well as acted his part. Mrs. Sol
Smith woB excellent as the nurse and
Bassett Rae was a pood Mercutio. For
some reason best knowu to himself
H. A. Langdon chose to play Friar
Lawrence as a toothless, senile
old fellow, who was almost in
audible. Dodson L. Mitchell came out
strong as the heavy Capulet father. He
rated his daughter in the vigorous fashion
which characterizes nineteenth century
family rows in the lower ranks of society.
If Juliet nad slanged him back he wou.d
probably have given her a black eye; but
although his brutal style was scarcely con
sistent with the majesty of the
head of the house of Capulet, it
was effective and telling and brought
\
htm a round of applause. The
rest of the cast was satisfactory and the
play was staged and costumed in an ideal
manner.
The Grand Opera-House.
There was an enthusiastic audience at the
Grand Opera-house last night to witness the
first performance of "The Captain's Mate."
This melodrama, like the one given at this
house last week, is full of action and striking
sensational scenes. The heroine is a young
woman who, when a mere child, had been kid
naped from her wealthy parents. She
grows up to womanhood in the care of
a lighthouoe-kceper, and there falls in love
witti the master of the ship Albatross, and
she, wishing lo follow the fortunes of
the man she loves, puts on the habili
ments of a boy and smuggles herself on her
lover's vessel. She succeeds in quelling a
mutiny on the vessel, saves the captain from
assassination, and tiie captain, not knowing
that his preserver is a woman, calls her "his
male." Finally the truth comes out, the cap
tain makes love to her, marries her, and suc
ceeds in restoring to her the property and
fortune that awalis her.
Miss Florence Bindley, the chief character,
had a part which enabled her to introduce
some ot her specialties, and sue acquitted her
seli well. K. J. llerron has a good comedy
part and so has Julia Blanc, whiie Howard
Kyle was exceedingly good as the master of
the Albatross. There are in the play a nnftn
ber of very startling incidents that are
brought out with good effect. The plauiiits of
the upper audience was an evidence of the sat
isfaction the performance gave.
The Columbia Theater.
"Tennessee's Pardner," the comedy-drama
.that has been praised by the Eastern critics,
was produced at the Columbia last night in
the presence of a fairiy good house.
The play, suggested by Bret Harte's charm
ing romance of mountain and mining life, is
one that will prove attractive when the
majority of the male members of the cast more
fully appreciHte the character of people who
inhabited a Nevada mining camp in the palmy
days of that State, and leÂ«rn tuat long boots
with it high polish on them are not the rule in
such a place nor even in Sanil Hill.
Jane Corcoran, in the character of Ten
nessee, gave a good conception of the part, in
wnich girlish innocence among rough and
ready people Is predominant. Chanes B.
Hawkins, as Geewhiliker Hay, a magnificent
liar, was the Ine of the piece, and his acting
vras excellent, and he ijftd a good support Iv
Annie Mortimer, who appeared as his wife.
Harry Mninhall as Caleb bwan and Oliver H.
Barr as A^a Bice, his side-partner, did their
share to make the play interesting. Esiht-r
Williams as the bride gave a very studied
piece of acting. A great leature was the songs
by a quartet, that was encored five times.
At the Orphenm.
Another strong bill is being presented at the
Orpheum this week, some of it consisting of
new performers and the rest of the best of iait
week's holdovers.
Tne Detroit brothers, one of the new acts,
made quite h hit with their acrobatic perform
ance. Their work, which is done on the stage,
is graceful as well as remarkably skillful.
Mays and Hunter are a clever banjo team, who
won repeated encores lost nicht. Among other
selections Liszt's second "Hungarian Rhap
sodic" vvus played by the two performers wiih
remarkable color and effect. Hunter also
played pait of the overture to ' 'William Tell
as h banjo solo very skillfully. Mays' jibe at
preachers in the imitation of a church ser
mon m>ght with advantage be suppressed.
If there is a fault to be found with this
week's programme, it is that it contains a
plethora oi comic acrobatic work. It is all
good of its kind, but there is a good deal of H.
The new grotesque comiques, Nelson, Glin
seretti ana Pemouio, do &uch startling acro
batic work that one forgives tin: weird make
up oi the man who is supposed to portray a
Chinaman.
The holdovers include the three brothers
Horn and Miss Joe R -eves, who made such a
hit last week; Herr (iritis and his trick donkey
and baboon; Ovaries Colby and Allie Way, ihe
ventriloquist and dancing doll; as welK us
Clayton, Jenkins and Jasper: Her, Burk and
Beiinar; and Eidora and .Norine.
Alcazar Theater.
The second week of tho "Ugly Duckling"
opened yesterday at the Alcazar Theater. The
performance is far :he best that lias yet been
given by the company. John T. Sullivan and
Miss May Buckley are doing especially excel
lent work, though the other performers are
not very fai* behind.
'me p'ltty Is one that well merits seeing, and
the staging is much more artistic than one has
a right to expect in a ho^e that plays at pop
ular prices. Altogether the Alcazar merits
the success it in beginning to meet with.
Tlvoll OjMT.i-Houie.
A number of clever new acts have been
added to the second edition of Ferris Hart
man's "Babes In the Wood," which opened at
the Tivoli Opera-house last night. The most
amusing new feature was the grand opera
quartet, in which Miss Seabrook cleverly
parodied Natali. Hartman nave tiie public his
version of De Vnes, while Darcy parodied
Micht-llna, and West took off Abramoff. The
penormance whs excruciatingly funny.
Two new songs that were warmly received
were the negro ditty Hartraan sang", "X Want
Those Presents Back,' 1 and Miss Seabrook's
new "Baby" song.
At the Chutes.
The Chutes had a clamp, wet day of It yester
day and consequently did not onen. On every
p'.ensant afternoon and evenine, however,
they will continue in lull operation.
"Arion," the new attiactiou, is certainly tho
most wonderful wire-walker ever seen here,
and his night illuminated bicycle ride over v
live trolley wire, sixty feet above the lake and
'200 feet long, must be seen to be appreciated.

The Cycle Industry in lireat Britain.
The Times of a late date has an interest
ing article dealing with the cycle industry,
from which it may readily be gathered
how great has been the development in
this direction of late months. It is com
puted from trustworthy sources that the
output for the British trade at, the present
rate of production may be stated at about
750,000 cycles per annum, which mr.y
roughly be valued at between Â£11,000,000
and Â£12,000,000. The exports of cycles iast
year were of the vaJneof Â£1,393,81(3, against
Â£1,200,913 of the previous year, and the in
crease has been of larger volume
this year. For the first, three months
the exports were valued at Â£444.509.
againÂ«t Â£329.096 in the first quarter of IS9o
and Â£329,535 in the same period of 1894;
while for the month of March last the
figures were Â£178,377. against Â£144,397 in
1895 and Â£142,184 in 1894. Since then tho
increase must have been even still greater.
Thus in the export trade as well as in the
home trade there has been a remarkable
advance. Up to the end of 18y5, accord
ing to the "Cyclist Year Book," the
reiuriu of the limited companies repre
sented a capital nearly approaching
Â£6,000,000. Since then there have been a
number of large developments, and it may
be taken that the amount of capital repre
sented by limited cycle companies makes
a grand total of ovei Â£17,000,000.âWest

CONTRACTOR FAY
FROM SAN JOSE
Deserts Santa Clara's Me
tropolis to Fight for
Phelan.
Men Who Do Business With
the Street Department
Apprehensive.
THEY FEAK HIS INFLUENCE.
Arrival of a Shrewd Man Who AN
ways Gets a Contract When
He Goes for It.
Street contractors, graders, dealers in
crushed rock (red or blue), asphaltum
cookers, and all who hope to make a live-
I lihood out of the prospective improve
ment of San Francisco thoroughfares, are
feeling uneasy because they scent danger
to their interests in the event of James D.
Pnelan being elected Mayor of this City.
Tne cause of this apprehension lies in
I the fact that a very shrewd young man
i has come all the way from San Jose to
help mafce Mr. Phelan's fight for the may
i orally. The name of this new champion
I in local politics is Charles W. Fay, and he
is known in the metropolis of Santa Clara
County as the smoothest catcher and
manager of municipal contracts to be
found in the State. To illustrate hi 3 abil
ity in this direction it may be recalled that
he has paved all the streets of San Jose
that have been paved in the last three
years. He never went for a job but that
I he got it, and all his opponents in the
I street contracting business soon learned
! that lie possessed some mysterious but
j most potent influence that invariably
j gave aim a pull with the officials who had
the letting of contracts for that work.
There was no guesswork, no chance
j taking with Mr. Fay. He gathered in all
j that was in sight, and whatever profits
I accrued from the business of smoothing
i the thoroughfares of San Jose were added
to his bank account. Like Richelieu he
could exclaim, "Rivals! I have none!"
for he drove them from the field discom
fited if ever they dared to show their yen
! turesome heads.
Frequently those on the outside won
dered how Fay could accumulate any
profit at the rate which he charged, but all
the time he appeared to prosper while
other contractors were absolutely left in
the cold.
Now local contractors are fearing that
Mr. Fay is seeking other worlds to con
quer and that he has cast his baleful
glances upon the plethoric Street Depart
ment fund of the City and County of San j
' Francisco. They augur the most disas
trous results to themselves from the fact
that he is so close to Mr. Phelan, who has
been nominated for Mayor by the Junta
' Democrats, and imagine that Mr. Fay
I would have a "puli :i with Mr. Phelan in
I the event of his election to the mayoralty.
Mr. Pnelan, when inloimed of this state
of feeling among San Francisco contract
ors, smiled indulgently and remarked that
this supposed menace to the contractors
has no foundation in fact.
"Mr. Fay is a good friend of mine,"
said Mr. Phelan. "He read of my nomi
nation and at once came to this City and
! offered his services in the campaign be
' cause business is slack with him in San
I Jose just now.
"Tney have a committee at work over in
i the Flood building, I understand, though
I I am supposed to know nothing about it."
"Is there any truth in the suggestion
i that you and Mr. Fay are partners in the
] street paving business and that he i* con
templating a removal to this City :" was
asked.
Mr. Phelan replied: "Mr. Fay and I are
not partners and never liave been. His
j lather was employed by my father years
! ago, and when he wanted to co into ihÂ« I
svreei-payini: business in San Jose I \
j backed him in his undertaking. He has j
bsen successful, I am pleased to say, and
is showing his appreciation of my friend
ship by doing what he can to forward my
I canvass. I ao not know whether he in
tends to move from San Jose to San Fran
cisco or not, but don't think he has any
such plan in contemplation."
Mr. Pbelan smiled a^ain when asked
his opinion in regard to Mr. Fay as a po
litical manipulator. "I never heard of \
Mr. Fay as an organizer of voters," he re
plied, "and I suppose I might have a
much shrewder political manager; but I
am sure that he will do his best to help
me win, and I am satisfied with that."
No words seem to reassure the San
Francisco contractors, however. They can
not help thinking that the friendship
which Mr. Phelan has for Mr. Fay will
insensibly sway him it' he should be
called on to perform tue duties of Mayor,
and so they look askance at the prospect
of having a "pet of the administration" in
the field against them when competing
for municipal contracts. They shudder
at the power that could be wielded in
favor of such a pet, and in the event of
the adoption of the proposed new charter

JOY IN SAN JOSE.
Contractors or That City Glad to
Saa Charles W. Fay Move
Out.
SAN JOSE, Cat,., Oct. 26.â The report
that Charley Fay, the well-known street
contractor, is likely to move from this city
to San Francisco has caused unfeigned
satisfaction among the contractors of San
Jose. For several years Mr. Fay lias been
able to control municipal contracts in a
most remarkable manner. By some kind
of mind-reading or hypnotic influence
Known only to himself and his confiden-
t ial associates, he loolcs into the minds of
those who have control of street-paving
contracts and figures to v fraction just how
much they will grant in the way of extra
allowances and rebates, after the awarding
of contracts, and he can also guess just
how low to put the figures in his bid in
order to obtain the contract.
Mr. Fay has been assoc ated with some
of the largest bituminous rock corpora
tions of the country, and his acquaintance
with their methods of doing business has
undoubtedly been of practical service to
him in the business of securing aud carry
ine out street-pavine contracts.
The departure of Mr. Fay would cause
no unhappiness amonjr other contractors
here, for tney consider his system of oper
ations to be so well developed that rivals
are "not in it" when he enters the lists as
a competitor.
MUD-WAY IN RICHMOND
Yesterday's Rain Had the Effect
of Testing the Sewer
Capacity.
First Avenue and Point Lobos Thor
oughfare Made Uninviting
to Drivers.
The Richmond district has been made
to take cognizance of the fact that it
rained yesterday. Evidence to the fact
was produced in the form of choked cul
verts on the street corners, which caused
the impeded waters to overflow the streets
and occasioned numerous inconveniences
to pedestrians, who bad to wade through
the muddy overflow on the crossings or
get out on the center of the streets, where
the mud and slush were inches in depth.
First avenue, that, much-neglected thor
oughfare which leads from the Golden
Gate Park to tne Presidio reservation, was
in sr.ch deplorable condition that two
teams got stuck in the mud and wet sand
and required the joint efforts of both men
and horses to relieve each other by first
uniting in removing one of the stranded
wagons to a place of safety and then ap
plying the same remedy to the other.
The blind sewer which has been partly
put down on Sixth avenue, but. which re
mains closed by reason of the objections of
the authorities of the French Hospital,
has been filled by the heavy rain until the
water backed out on the low levels along
its course. This sewer would have a good
outlet if connected with the Point Lobos
main sewer, one block from where it re
mains closed.
The neglected condition of Point Lobos
avenue was made more than apparent by
the storm of yesterday, which had the
effect of turning the accumulation of dust
and dirt which has been permitted to re
main there for the past year into a mass
of red, sticky mud, uninviting to those
whose business compelled them to drive
through it.
The filling in of old Bay District race
course has had the effect of making the
bald sandhills that were so perceptible to
the vision disappear from view. The con
tinuous sand-eater which has been at work
there for the past two months has re
moved thousands of tons of this material,
which has been carted into the racecourse
and there dumped to nil in the large hol
low which stood in the center.
This plain will, when tilled in, be
offered for sale in building lots, which will
have the effect of increasing the popula
tion and adding more wealth to the Rich
mond district.

WILLIAM HcKINLET, of Ohio
FOR VICF-PKESIDENTâ
GARRET A. BOBART, or New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Keep the ball rolling.
Don't lag in the fight now.
Be ready to welcome Tom Reed.
The work of this week wins the victory.
The Popocrats boa t, but they don't bet.
Have your decorations ready for
parade.
San Francisco should come pretty near
making it unanimous.
There is no doubt of the victory, but we
must make it overwhelming.
"Rally Round the Flag, Boys," will be
the popular tune on Saturday.
Passion and prejudice may clamor as
they will, but patriotism laughs at them.
A.ll friends of prosperity are united in
sentiment and all should be united in
action.
Show your colors, assert your principles
and make yourselves count on the side of
good government.
The rain won't hurt the Republican
campaign. It has simply dropped In to
promote prosperity.
The big parade will be the feature of the
week, and don't forcet that you are ex
pected to take part in it.
The coercion cry has not been com
pletely choked off, but it has been reduced
to a mighty small squawk.
We have reached the rush line of the
Bryanites in the Presidential contest. Tbe
lago is in sight and the foe is demoralized.
We count on men from ali parts of the
State to join in the Saturday demonstra
tion and help in giving Tom Reed a Cali
fornia welcome.
When loyal Republicans and conserva
tive Democrats march together the only fit
emblem of the parade is the banner of
their National patriotism.
Bryan, the free-trader, deserves no sup
port from any friend of American labor,
for he has never done anything to promote
any industry of the country.
Had there been no hard times there
would have been no Bryanism, and had
there been no Bryanite free-traders there
would have been no hard times.
If any intelligent Democrat feels him-
Belf coerced into voting for McKinley it is
because the experience with free trade and
the fear of Bryanism has done it.
The money which comes into the coun
try for farm products will co out of the
country for foreign goods if we do not put
a speedy end to the low tariff and restore
the protective system.
Conservative Democrats should unite
with Republicans in voting for Colonel
Taylor as well as for McKinley. We must
have a pood irovernment in the City as
well as in the Nation.
Every vote cast for a Democratic candi
date for the Legiiature is a vote to help
Cator to the United States Senate, and
every intelligent man knows what that
will mean for California.
Bear in mind that tha grand parade is
not intended to be a partisan procession so
much as a patrioticdemonstration against
Bryanism and that all ci izenswho intend
to vote for McKinley have a right to a
place in it.
California always had a strong friend in
Tom Reed and can count on him at all
times to champion her industries. Her
people of all parties owe to him a loyal
welcome to the State and it should be a
pleasure to all to unite in expressing it.
Almost all the conservative Democrats
of the East will vote directly for McKin
ley instead of for Palmer and Buckner, as
it has become evident the only way to
Bave their party from becoming a menace
to the Nation is to stamp the Bryanism
out of it this year once and for all.
Colonel Ingersoll's argument that the
free coinage of silver would be ' of no
benefit to the American silver miner
because it would allow foreigners to shiD
their silver bullion into the country and
get all the benefits of the mints is wortb
thf ;-erious attention of the people of the
silver States. Free silver would prob
ably be as disappointing to American in
terests as free w oi.
In 1892 under the protection given to the
-heep industry of the country by the
Republican tariff there were in she United
States over 47,000,000 sheep valued at
1 125,000,000. but in 1895 under the Demo
cratic tariff tbe indu try wns so depressed
the number of American slieep decreased
to about 38.000 000 and the value t> little
more than $65,000,000. That is the re>ult
of the experiment, Now, how do you like
iree wool?
THE FINAL REPORT.
The election will occur one week from
to-day and the time intervening will be a
period of intense party activity and of the
highest public interest in the men and
issues whose success or defeat are depend
ent upon the vote of the people to be cast
on Tuesday next.
The Republicans of California, and
their leaders ana organized committees,
should enter upon tbe week with the reso
! lution to make it the most active and frnit
j ful one of the entire campaign. JThis is
the time of all others when every plan of
campaign should be carried to its conclu
sion and when the loose ends o! every
effort sbouid be collected and securely
tied.
It should be a week of the utmost
watchfulness, not only in the avoid
ance of errors, but also of traps, and in
! the discovery and defeat of those desper
ate expedients which the enemy from old
habits is apt to attempt during the last
few days of the campaign. Every roor
back should be promptly shot, every bug
aboo exploded, every false assertion run to
earth and every attempted fraud uncov
ered and put to shame.
The campaign in California has thus far
been most intelligently, carefully ana suc
cessfully conducted, and for such conduct
the Republican Executive Committee de
serves all praise. Let every Republican,
and every friend of Republican principles
in this election resolve that during the
closing week of the campaign thay will
in every way sustain and assist the organ
ized forces of the party. If this resolu
tion is carried into effect, a splendid vic
tory for McKinley is assured, and
California will go Republican by one of
the largest majorities in its history as a
State.
The policy of the Republican party In
vites to greater development, to greater
activity, greater population and greater
honor. The policy of the opposition
favors the continuance and extension of
free trade, whose blighting hand is felt
upon every material interest of the
country. It favor* free silver, which
means the destruction of business, the
impairment of values, the repudiation
of debts, the greatest panic in our his
tory, the wreck of all our interests and
distress to all oar people everywhere.
We want in this country neither free
trade nor free silver. âMcKinley.
THE GREAT PARADE.
The grand procession of the supporters
of McKinley and Hobart which has been
arranged for Saturday afternoon in this
City is to be something more than a par
tisan demonstration and s-omething more
than a civic parade. Men of all parties
who stand for prosperity, sound money,
good business and law and order will
unite to raise it above the level of a party
display, and delegations of marchine clubs
from all parts of the State will widen its
scope beyond that of a San Francisco
movement.
Information received from surrounding
cities makes it certain that all of Central
California will be represented, and most
of the principal cities of the northern and
southern sections of the State. It is going
to be in the truest sense of the word a
patriotic demonstration in which all Cali
fornia will take part and in which the
friends of good government will attest
their determination to put California in
the Republican column on election day.
A demonstration of this kind would in
itself have attracted large numbers of
people from the interior of the State to
the City and without the advantage of the
presence of a great man it would have been
a notable day in the history of our poli
tics. It happens, however, that a great
man will be present and that the enthu
siasm of the people win be augmented by
the inspiration of a great leader. The
parade wilt not only manifest the patriot
ism of California, but it will also manifest
the admiration of the people for that great
Republican leader, Tom Reed.
The industries of California have had no
abler or more devoted champion than the
man wbo comes now to this coast to rally
Republicans and honest money Demo
crats in support of the cause which con
cerns the whole Union. He therefore de
serves as a friend as well as a leader the
cordial welcome of the people, and it
should be given to him with a fervor that
leaves no doubt of its sincerity.
The only suitable emblem for a parade
of this kind, in which men of all parties
unite to declare their devotion to the Na
tional welfare and to do honor to a great
National statesman, is the banner of the
Nation itself. Whatever other banners
may be carried in the procession the Na
tional flag should be everywhere conspicu
ous and predominant. It is no party issue
that we have before us. Eminent Demo
crats have united not only with eminent
Republicans, but with scholars, finan
ciers, and all men of light and leading in
the country, to declare that the contest
involves National integrity and National
honor more than the success of any one
party. It is for that reason that party
lines have among honest and intelligent
Democrats been abandoned and a union
been formed with loyal Republicans to
make sure of the defeat of Bryanism and
all that is meant by the alliance of Populist
agitators with the Altgelds and Tilimans
of radical Democracy.
It can hardly be necessary to urge upon
the people the importance of making this
demonstration a most overwhelming one
in every respect. It should be so great
that the very reports of it through the
East will carry good cheer and encourage
ment to the hearts of all loyal citizens. It
should make sure to the people of Maine
that Californians are as true as themselves
in loyalty to Tom Reed and all that
he represents, and it should give assurance

MRS. HEARST'S GIFT.
The generous offer ol Mrs. Phoebe Hearst
to contribute the funds necessary to ob
tain plans for the fitting architectural
improvement of the university at Berke
ley sets an example which many others on
the coast should rival one another in emu
lating. What she has done is another
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1896.
illustration of that public spirit which
actuates the wealth of America and the
evidences of wi ose regard for education
are to be seen in the cities and university
towns of every State in the Union.
It is the intention of Mrs. Hearst to do
somett intr more than provide for the plans
of architectural improvement. Sbe lias
made it known that she and i er son in
tend to make liberal gif 8 for the erection
of stately buildings on the university
grouiids when tne general plans have
been adopted. It is believed that her con
tributions to the State University may
ultimately reach the sum of $1,000,000.
This gift will most fittingly serve aB a
monument to the man who built up ihe
Hearst fortune and whose devotion to the
welfare of the State, so often proved dur
ing his life, will be thus commemorated
to posterity.
It is certainly a wonderlul future that
lies before the university at Be keley.
Every prospect is bright with evidences
of the comine of a time when that will be
one of the most beautiful and stately seats
of learning in the whole wo Id. Backed
by the wealth of the State and supported
by the generous gifts of those whose skill
and energy have been favored by fortune
in the accu nmiation of wealth, itis within
the limits of probability that its colleges,
halls and museums may within the life
time of people now living become equal to
any that the great capitals of Europe
Lave erected for the beneht of their people.
The site at Berkeley is most excellently
adapted for tlie display of stately build
ings. Any structures erected there will be
as beautiful lor situation as they can pos
sibly be for the art with which they are
adorned. It has long been recognized
that in order to attain the best effects fur
future building some general plan should
be adopted for the laying out of the
grounds and the structures so tliat they
would form when completed a harmonious
whole.
The offer of Mrs. Hearst to defray the
expense of the plans for this prepara
tory work comes at a most opportune
tirue. It is evident that many new build
ings will be required at Berkeley in the
near future. Nor is it less evident that
the money required for these buildings
will be speedily forthcoming, either from
the State or from its rrunificent citizens.
It is, therefore, a timely as well as a
generous gift, and Mrs. Hearst, who has
already done so much for the people of
California, will find tnat this last gift of
hers is recognized as the most useful and
most noble ot them all.
Oar foes are waging a campaign which
is at bottom wagÂ«d primarily against
morality und ab lity. They hate the
men who pay their debts and obey the
laws, exactly as they hate the men who
win success in life or who cause the,
laws to be enforced. They use frÂ»e
silver as a cry because they hope there
with for the moment Iâ > m slead some
honegt men and to bribe some dis
honest men ; but they really care lit â¢lo
for any particular form of policy as re
gards the currency. At bottom what
they most desire is to strike down the
men who by virtue of leadership In any
walk of life, whether it be in business
or theology, or law or literature or
science, tend by their efforts to raise the
whole community upward â Theodore

COLONEL TAYLOR'S CANVASS.
The canvass of Colonel Taylor is being
conducted with an earnest and well
organized activity which gives confidence
to the hope of bis election in the mind of
good citizens. It has been a canvass that has
made for our next Mayor both friends ana
votes. It has won for him the aio of many
solid and influential citizens who ordi
narily do not take an active part in poli
tics and who are working for him simply
because they recognize that his past ser
vices are a guarantee that tie will give this
City thn reform in municipal administra
tion it has so long needed.
Business men of all parties have been
well pleased by the open and straight
forward way in which Colonel Taylor has
discussed every issue presented in the
municipal campaign. This frankness of
speech concerning the future is in perfect
accord with his record on the Board of
Supervisors and clearly illustrates the
candor and sterling honesty of the man.
Loyal Republicans who desire to see the
party successful in local as well as in Na
tional affairs have every reason to con
gratulate themselves on their leader in
this contest. Colonel Taylor is well able
to hold the vot- ot all stalwart members
of the party and to draw strength from
the independent vote. His candidacy is
one of the best Republicans could have in
the mixed campaien of this year, and it is
pleasing to note that as the canvass devel
ops loyal Republicans are becoming every
day more sancuine of a victory that will
be at onco a success for the party and an
assurance of good government for the City.

CATOR FOR THE SENATE.
The alliance arranged between the
fusion managers in this State contem
plates the election of Cator to the Unitd
States Senate in tho case of a fusion ma
jority in the State Legislature. Every
man, therefore, who votes for a Demo
cratic or Populist legislator votes lor
Cator, and the people of this Slate are
too familiar with the character and the
record of Mr. Cator to nped that w^ should
point out what his election to the Senate
would mean to California.
As the Populist State Convention in
dorsed Mr. Cator for the Senate, it is per
haps too late to remonstrate with Pop
ulists upon the course which has been
marked out for them by their leaders. It
is fair to assume that Mr. Cator repre
sented the leadership of tne Populists in
tne convention or he would not have pot
that indorsement California Democrats,
however, are in a different position. They
nt'ver indorsed Mr. Cator, and they have
been brought into a support of him only
by a system oi political combination
which is very little removed from trickery
and fraud.
It is hardly possible that any intelligent
Democrat should be willing to give any
support to a movement which tends to the
election to the United States Senate from
California oi a man who so little repre
sents either the sentiment or the
business of - the State. Mr. Cator is
in the fullest s^nse of the word a political
adventurer. Neither his actions nor his
language show him to be in any way a
supporter of capital or labor or law. He
is an agitator pure and simple. He would
misrepresent California more perversely
than Peffer misrepresented Kansas.
Despite all objections that conservative
Democrats have to Mr. Cator, he has by
ihe fusion mana.ers been put into the
position of the Democratic as well as the
PoDulist candidate for the Senate. There
is but one way to make sure of his defeat,
and that is by ttie election of men to the
State Legislature who will elect a Senator
that can be counted on to advocate pro
tection to California industries and sup
port the administration of McKinley and
Hobart. To that end all gooil citizens
should unite, Democrats as well as Repur>
Jicans. The aim in this campaign is to
silence the agitators of discontent, and for
that purpose union on the election oi good
legislators is as necessary as anion for the
election of the RepuDlican ticket for Presi
dential electors.

WILLIAM WALLACE BOWERS.
After serving his constituents acceptably for three terms William Wallace Bowers
is again the nominee of the Republicans of the Seventh District for Congress. Mr.
Bowers was born in Whitestown, Oneida County, New York, October 20, 1834. He
attended the common school until 14 years of Â«tre. Then he worked on a farm for
several years, and removed to Wisconsin in 1852. He enlisted as a private in Com
pany I, First Wisconsin Cavalry, Februrry 22, 1862, and served during the war, his last
duty being post wagonmaster at Cape Girardeau, Mo. He removed to San Diego in
1869, where he has since resided. In 1873 he was elected a member of the California
Legislature. In 1874 he was appointed Collector of Customs for the San Diego District
and held the office for eight years. In 1886 he was elected State Senator for four years
and was elected to the Fifty-second and Fifty-third Congresses and re-elected to the
Fifty-fourth Congress as a Republican, receiving 18,434 vo es against 12,111 votes for
W. H. Alford (D.), 1669 votes for W. H. Somers (Pro.) and 10,719 votes for J. L.Gilbert
(Pop.). He was unanimously renominated at the last Congressional convention to
represent the Seventh District in the Fifty-fifth Congress.
THE PRESS ON WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
Th 6 unanimity ot the newspapers of our
State from north to south upon the subject of
equal suffrage is simply wonderful. To the
true believer it is a cause for renewed effort, a
perpetual inspiration. Quotations from all of
the champions of amendment 6 would make
very interesting reading, but space permits
only the use of a few out of many.
Far Siskiyou County has long been a strong
hold for woman suffrage, and Mr. Nixon of the
Yreka Journal was one of the earliest editors
to declare for it The Dunsmulr Herald of that
county says, "Vote for amendment 6 on tne
3d of November next and give the women of
California the right of citizenship."
The Grass Valley Tidings answers one of the
most "absurd of the objections thus: "Many
opponents of woman suffrage declare that only
bad women will vote. The unvarying testi
mony from all States where women ; do vote is
that the so-called 'bad women' are not mani
fest at the polls. ii If they vote at all it is in a
quiet â  and . inconspicuous manner. â¢ No candi
date would imperil his chances with X; the
masses of women by catering to this element.
The 'bad women' form so small: a portion of
all the women in the State as to give no cause
for alarm, and â  because of these lew it is most
unjust to keep all women disirancnised."
The Anderson Valley News says: ; "If woman
is a worthy queen of home she is entitled to a
voice in the making of : laws that will make or
mar the home. No one can guard a treasure

them: J; Iv si this ", county i and, we i believe, in :
other counties of the Sta'e, the women who
are i for most in I asking; lor a i favorable vote
are among the best wives and mothers in the
country. are women who do F their own
housework and J cooking. Th-y are women
whose houses! are in order and whose families,'
as a rule, are well cared for in every respect.
They are the women who do most for public
charities and public benefits. They are among
the women who maintain the character and
respectability of their sex, and who perform
their part in the social, intellectual and
business functions of the county with grace,
skill and honor. They are among the wom
anly women of the land, not too nice, nor too
timid, nor too cowardly to go to the legally
established voting places, the fountain-head
of government, to do their duty. Those op
posea to equal suffrage cannot say a word
against the great mass of women who are
working for the amendment, and hence, for
this reason, every true voter should support
the measure."
The Long Beach Eye says: "The Eye is glad
to see the growing interest manifest on every
side in this question, and will hail the day
when wives, mothers and sisters of this broad
land shall be given the ballot and full repre
sentation in the affairs of the Government.''

vote, says equal suffrage is a good thing.

A WORD TO WAGE-BARNERS.
New York Press.
Does any wage-earner believe that silver will
go to $1 29 an ounce because Mr. Bryan says it
will? Silver is falling every day, and it will
continue to fall, because there is more silver
in the world than the world has use for.
Did any wage-earner benefit when the Wil
son law closed enough American mills and
factories to throw 1,000,000 men out of em
ployment and to take away from our working
men more than $300,000,000 a year in wages ?
Will any wage-earner benefit if more mills
and factories close down, more business
houses fail, more railroads go into the hands
of receivers ?
If silver should go to $1 29 an ounce, what
difference would it wake to the wage-earner?
If it should not go, his dollar would buy less,
and in the crash that followed Bryan's elec
tion, with tens of thousands of situations lost,
his dollars would bo scarcer than they are
now.
What wage-earner will invite loss of em
ployment by voting for a dollar that will close
mills, factories and business houses just as the
Wilson bill closed them? What wage-earner
will invite poverty for himself by voting for a
dollar that will buy less than he earns? What
wage-earner will invite starvation for his wife
and children by voting for a dollar that will
bring panic and chaos in all employing indus
tries?
If there is any wage-earner who wishes to
gamble with the bread of his family let him
vote for William J. Bryan.
MR BRYAN'S UBLL SERVICE.
Lincoln (Nebr ) Journal.
A citizen of West Virginia writes to a friend
in Nebraska, asking for a review of the record
of Mr. Bryan. The letter has been referred to
the Journal. It will require but a short para
graph to answer it in full.
Mr. Bryan came to Lincoln a young attorney
in 1887. He was elected to Congress in 1890
with the assistance of the Populists, and
scraped through in 1892 by the skin of his
teeth, again with Populist assistance. In
1894 he was a candidate for the Senate, and
was turned down with great vigor and en
thusiasm by the people of Nebraska. He has
made a great many speeches in Congress and
elsewhere, but has never done anything for his
people more tangible than securing the plac
ing of an elevator in the Lincoln Postoflie and
Custom-house. Tiiat elevator bears a small
plate saying: '"This elevator was secured
through the efforts of Hon. W. J. Bryan " or
words to that effect.
This is Mr. Bryan's entire public record up
to tne time he made a speech to a frantic mob
in Chicago and was made a Presidential can
didate.

employes with shorter hours' of labor., in a
word, the city of Glasgow . is :n the hands of
Populists aad Its affairs are : administered on
purely Populistic principles.
Our municipal platiorin outlines just such a
government for the City of San Francisco, and
as v I stated in my .as; letter to The Call all
our municipal candidates stand on our piat
form and are pledged to our principles as ap
plied to municipal government. ; It is appro
priate to add. here that in the selection and
nomination of our ticket I am certain that
time will .make it clear to every honorable '
man in San Francisco that the People's party
was the only really non-partisan party in the
City this ytar. '
; In this connection I desire, to add a few
words of a personal nature. In my chat with
The Call reporter 1 supposed he fully under
stood that 1 was not: talking for. publication.
My whole purpose was to disabuse his mind as
to any impression he might have that the
Populist.- uaa been : outwitted ! and entrapped
by Buckley, ana assured him that Buckley
freely admitted that the day of the boss in
politics will be over the moment that the
People's party comes into power, because our
principle of direct legislation will eliminate .
the boss, and ne will have to go out of busi
ness and will : stay out; because Populists are
strict believers in rigid civil service.
On this distinct understanding Mr. Buckley
was informed that the Populists were wil ing,
as I believed, to receive the support of any
party or faction in San Francisco which would ' ,
place the People's party in control of the City
government. He was further informed that
Populists are individuals in the lullest sense
and cannot be "herded" or led to do a thing
or support any ticket which they do not ac
cept as individuals; but they are good fighters
and will stand together on what seems the best
thing to do, and on : no , other terms. In deal
ing with Populists ho wou.d have to take into
account the fact that they never take orders or
dictation irom a boss or any one else, but act
on their individual judgment. I then nssured
the reporter that no orders of any kind had
ever been proposed by Mr. Buckley, but on the
other hand he had accepted * the terms named
by the Populists, and that I believed he had
kept his word without equivocation.
--â  In this connection 1 should also state that
when the People's party municipal convention
met, the writer of this setter wrote out resolu
tions proposing such an alliance with the anti
monopoly and. silver forces of this City, and
providing for a committee of six on conference
on candidates, and these resolutions were
adopted by the municipal convention by an
almost unanimous vote, and the committee
was i duly appointed. This committee was
made. up of.oid and;. tried Populists who had'
and still have the confidence and respect of
the Populists of this City. I was honored
with a place on that committee and know
that overtures were at once made to the Non- .
Partisans and the Junta Democrats, and
several informal ; conferences were he.d with
prominent : and active members of both of
these ' organizations. Indeed, several days
were lost. in this way, as these Non-Partisans
and Junta Democra.s finally ignored our over
tures and failed to meet us even informally.
In the meantime, overtures came to us from
: the.other Democratic organ zaiion, which had
openly declared for Bryan and free silver, our
natural allies in the present political contest.
But that is not all. These candidates all stand
on our municipal platform pledged to cm
principles as applied, to -municipal govern
ment, while their first pledge was the support
of Bryan and free silver.

GOVERNOR BUDD
TO WORKMEN
He Declares That California
Has Not Enough
Silver.
Hard to Get Change for a Twenty-
Dollar Piece on Market
Street
VOTES FOR BRYAN'S ELECTORS.
The Chief Executive S ys He Intends
to Aggregate Them From All
the Ballots.
Governor James H. Budd addressed a
labor-silver mass-meeting at Union Hall
last night. The Governor was in genial
mood, and soon had the audience in uni
son with him. So cordial was tne under
standing that the speaker and his hearers
frequently exchanged expressions of opin
ion with that freedom that is only known
among the people of the Pacific Coast.
The meetine was called to order by E.
M. Wardal!, who introduced as chairman
of the evening, Henry Meyer, past presi
dent of the District Trades Council. Mr.
Meyer spoke earnestly on the silver ques
tion, and the bearing it has on the pros
perity of men who worK for wages.
C. D. Lane also delivered a brief address,
after which a quartet from the State Uni
versity sang some spirited campaign bal
lads.
When Governor Budd was introduced
by Chairman Meyer he was enthusias
tically greeted with applause and cheers.
The Governor opened his address by
paying a tribute to the worth of the me
chanics and laboring men of the country.
He said t at the manhood of the country
constitutes the real wealth of this magnifi
cent Nation.
Money, as such, the Governor declared,
is merely a medium of exchange, its only
real function is to bring together the buyer
and the seller. He continued :
God, the sacred gold of the goldites, cannot
produce anything of itself. Take all the gold
in the world and deposit it on the Faralloae
islands and it will not increase, nor will it
produce anything. The seagull will continue
to lay their esgs there and will propaente their
young, but even as frail a community as the
gulls will not be affected by the presence of
the gold.
Put labor in any situation in the world, with
or without tools, and wealth will soon be cre
ated and increased. That is the difference be
tween money and labor.
Some of you men work at the Union Iron
Works. You work for Irving M. Scott, an able
writer on political economy, and I want to
call your attention to his article in the last
number of the Overland Monthly. In the
October number of that magazine he explains
tha; gold and silver have both intrinsic and
extrinsic value, and that the Government
siampof authority adds to the value of the
money metals. In this view Mr. Scott is
joined by Wayland and nearly ail the other
writers on political economy in the United
Btates. I think ihat all public writers have
agreed on that, except a few men who may Le
described as confirmed goldbugs.
At this point W. P. Lawlor, chair
man of the silver campaign committee,
lent the Governor a twenty-dollar gold
rioce and a silver dollar, wher upon the
Governor said that the gold double eagle
bears a British crown upon its face, while
the silver dollar has the wheat sheaf of
the laboring man. The speaker raised a
laugh by saying that he was proud to
have Mr. .Lawlor trust him with so much
money, and if lie was sure of another hon
est miner in the crowd he would bet that
the twenty-dollar piece could not be
changed within ten blocks oi t c hall in
whicii he was speakinc He met a friend
on Market street the other day who
wanted $20 in silver for $20 in gold. Un
fortunately he bad nothing but green
backs and couldn't help bis friend. He
said that, as a matter of fact, there is not
enough silver coin in the State of Califor
nia to properly carry on the business of
the people. The twenty-dollar piece is
the coin of Great Britain, he said, while
silver is thÂ« coin of the common people.
Governor Buid said be was sure that
some of the Republican leaders expected
to prevent, if possible, the counting ot all
bahots cast for Bryan electors at the next
election, Dy trying to keep the aggrega
tion of votes cast for J. V. Webster and
the other electors who have their names
on two tickets, the Democratic and the
Populst.
"I met an able Republican to-day on my
way to this City who told me that he
didn't know how they could tell that the
same name on the two tickets meant the
same per-on. I replied that according to
the law of California identity of name pre
sumes identity of person.
" "That may be true,' he said, 'but if the
Secretary of State refuses to â '
" 'Oh, the Secretary of State is all right,'
I replied. 'He la required to certify to the
Governor of the S"tate the returns of the
election, and the Governor, and only the
Governor, has to perform the duty of
certifying the reauit to the Congress of the
United States, and I'll attend to that mat
ter in a proper way.'
'Now, fellow-citizens, I will tell you
that I intend to see that Bryan gets every
vote that is cast for him in California. I
would not count my own party In, and by
the E.ernal I do not intend to see it
counted out."
Governor Budd ridiculed the proposed
midday parade that is to be held in San
Francisco by the followers of McKinley.
He said it was intended as a means by
which the employers would be able to spot
their employes if they refused to march
in the McKsnley parade. He said: "I ad
vise ail you wofkint;nu>n to march In that
parade and then to vote as you please.
When you get into the voting booth take
out your little stamp and when you see
your favorite on the ticket put down the
holy cross opposite and you have done
your duty, despite all efforts at coercion."
J. T. Moriarky closed the meeting with
a few well chosen remarks.
A BIG "DOLLAR."
Governor Budd Is to Have a 32 to
1 Symbol Framed.
Governor Budd was in the rooms of the
Democratic State Campaign Committee at
the California "Hotel yesterday tri
umphantly displaying a huge coin of white
metal, which is supposed to represent the
32 to 1 silver dollar that tho Bryanites
would bring upon the public if they could
win.
This simulated coin bears the usual
effigy of the American eagle, and around
the edg? are the words:
United States of America. :
16 to iâ Nit. |
"That was presented to me by my friend
John D. Spreckels," said the Governor,
"and 1 intend to have it framed for future
re:erence. 1 want to see whether it ia a
true prophecy or false."
Tnousands of th?se white me:al "tokens"
have been circulated by the leaders of the
.Republican party during the present cam
pftign, for the purpose of illustrating the
effect which the election of Bryan would
have on the monetary affairs of the coun
try. It is noticed that many thoughtful

TO WATCH BALLOTS.
Two Hundred Trained Printers
May Be Secured for
That Duty.
W. B. Benoist, secretary of the San
Francisco Typographical Union, has noti
fied candidates and others who wish to
employ watchers for election booths that
the services of at least 200 printers may be
secured for that purpose.
Mr. Benoist draws attention to the fact
that these printers are accustomed to
staying up all night, and therefore would
not be likely to go to sleep at their posts,
as is so often the case with men who are
in the habit of going to bed with the
chickens.
Another point in their favor as watch
ers is that t eir business trains them to
careful attention to details, and their ac
quaintance with tabulated work qualifies
them to keep accurate account of the
progress of the tallying clerks.
Candidates or others wishing to avail
themselves of the services of printers as
watchers are requested to address Secre
tary Benoist, 606 Monteomerv street.
PHELAN'S MANNERISMS.
Colonel Kowalsky Talks on the Money
Question and Other Things.
.â â  Colonel Kowalskyaddressed a Republi
can meeting held' at Eighteenth-street
Turn Vereia Hall last evening. He dealt
with the money question and with ''Young
Mr. Ph'elan." During his speech he said:
The question that' the American people
must decide is whether they can afford to run
a first-class country, with all other conditions
equal- to it, with a second-class money;
whether we are not belittling ourselves when
we refuse to ; maintain . fot-purselves . the best
kind of money â the monejr that has the high
est possible valueâ the kind of money that the
bondholder demands his interest shall be paid
in; whether that money which we all recog
nize as the very b st s money in the world is
any too good for the laborer who is a citizen of
the best country in the world. Â
Here the colonel scored a hit with his
auditors by mildly ridiculing the youthful
Democratic nominee for Mayor. He spoke
of "Young Mr. Phelan, who lives at the
Pacitic-Union Ciub, gets his gloves from
Europe, rolls up his trousers when it
rains in London, says 'cawnt,' and affects
other aihs."
At this point some of Joseph Kelly's
friends who were assembled in the
audience demanded, eood - naturedly,
"What's the matter with Kelly?" The
speaker immediately replied that "noh
ing is the matter with Kelly. He's my
personal friend, but principle and my
duty to my party prevent me from voting
for -Mr. Kr'lly."
In coiiCiUsion the speaker remarked:
"I want to impress upon you, my fellow
citizens, that the present time is one for
patriotic action; be you Democrat or Re
publican, it makes little or no differenceâ
it is your duty at this time, if you believe
in honest money, io forget party and rally
under a common standard.
A MATRIMONIAL MUDDLE
Love Born Awheel Bursts ihe
Ties That Bind Two
Families.
Annie Fairfied Sues Her Husband for
Divorce Under Strange Cir
cumstances.
Mrs. Annie Fairfield yesterday began
suit for divorce against her husband, Or
lando W. Fairfield. The suit is probably
a sequel to the proceeding by means of
which Mrs. Georgie Mitchell was freed
from Thomas J. Mitchell.
In the complaint filed by Mrs. Mitchell,
she alleged that her husband had been
guilty of infidelity and named Mrs. Fair
field as corespondent. She said that it
was a case of "love awhee/' with Mitchell
and Mrs. Fairfield, who, she claimed, be
came acquainted while bicycling in Golden
Gate Park and were accustomed to take
long moonlight rides together.
That the acquaintance ripened into a
stronger feeling Mrs. Mitchell fully be
lieves, and that Mr. Fairfield was careless
of its consequences she alleged. She said
that the Fairtields and Mr. Mitchell occu
pied the same residence, and that, despite
her remonstrances, Her husband refused
to be swerved from his d votion to the
auburn-naired bloomer girl.
That t ere was method in Mr. Fair
field's- apparent madness in allowing his
spouse to receive Mitchell's attentions
would appear from the complaint filed
yesterday. In it the plaintiff alleges tnat
Fairfielct has been too intimate with no
less than three women, whose names she
quotes.
In Judge Daingerfield's court a few days
ago, when the Mitchell case was tried, the
husband appeared more than anxious to
throw no obstacle in the way of his wile
getting her decree. His only objection
wan entered when Mrs. Fairfield was
named. He acknowledged having been
unfaithful, but said another woman than
his inamorata was his companion.
If Mrs. Fai>-field gets her divorce there
may be a remating all around.

IN THE FURY OF
A SOUTHEASTER
It Made Things Lively for
Shippers and Ship
ping.
There Was Not Much Damage,
but Some Narrow Escapes
Were Recorded.
DRIFTED DOWN ON THE TIGER.
Brig Salvator and the English Tramp
Were in Collision Off Val
lejo Street
The rirst southeaster of the season came
up yesterday morning. It has been ex
pected for some time, but nevertheless
came up unexpectedly. At Ua.m. it was
only blowing a moderate gale off Point
The Old-Timfc "Whaling Bark John and Wmthrop Entering Port
After an Unsuccessful Trip to the Arctic She Brought
Back a Story of Deaths, Desertions and Disasters.
Reyes, bat at 2 p. m. the baric Columbia
had to put off shore on account of the
heavy weather. Later in the day the
steam schooners anchored in the China
basin and those at the Channel-street
wharves got up steam and went away
around the lee of Telegraph Hill or found
a berth noTth of Mission street. There
was a scurry of ship captains to get aboard
their ships, and some of them, whose
vessels were south of Folsom street, took
over two hours in getting aboard.
In one instance it took five men just
twenty minutes to pull the length of the
cruiser Philadelphia. Early in the after
noon the captain of the warship issued
orders that the steam launch should not
be run any more until the storm went
d own and in consequence ail the men on
shore leave had to take up their abode in
downtown lodging-houses.
"When the storm first came up the pas
sengers on the steamer Oakland got a
great scare. They left the mole on the
11:30 trip, and when l.ali way across a
â¢quail struck the ferry-boat and made her
heel over until everybody thought she
was going down. Women screamed and
some fainted, while those who were sit
ting on the port side were* sent sprawling
on the floor. Many of the male passen
gers became frightened and there was a
general rush for life-preservers. Before
the excitement had subsided a big wave
broke aboard, but did no damage save to
deluge a parr of the lower forward dock.
When the Oakland reached her slip every
body was more than pleased to be once
again on terra firma.
The crew of the scow-schooner Albert
was in a predicament. The carvo con
sisted of a load of flour and of course it
was all on deck. The boat was headed for
Mission-street wharf, but belorc- she conld
be made fast the rain began coming down.
Then the tarpaulins were got out and the
cargo covered, but as every now and then,
even in her sheltered corner, a sea broke
aboard, the chances are that considerable
of the flour was damaged.
Aboui 3:30 Â» M. the brig Salvator drifted
down on the British tramp Tiger and aid
considerable damage, principally to her
self. The Tiger was r ady to sail for Cal
cutta with a load of wheat, and Captain
Metcalf, Lloyd's surveyor, went out to her
in order to ascertain what damage had
been done. The steamer was not dam
aged to any great extent, so she will go to
sea as soon as Captain Edwardson has his
clearance papers. The Salvaior finally
drifted clear and a second anchor held her.
Captain Cantell of the British tramp
steamer Wennington Kail and his wife
and daughter had a narrow escape. They
reacned the Clay-street steps just as the
ship's boat was leaving with i:300 pounds
of grates for the boilers. It was an over
load, considering the state of the weather,
but when the captain and his family
started to get aboard Boatman John Carter
told them they wouid swamp before they
were 100 yards away from the end of the
wharf. Captain Cantell said he knew
what he was doing and ordered the boat
away. Carter got out bin Whitehall and
prepared for an emergency. Sure enough,
when the ship's boat struck the heavy
swell she began to fill, and before Captain
Cantell could et her around his wife and
daughter were wet through. Then Carter
came along and took the master and his
family into his boat and took them to the
ship. The mate set one of the men to
Dailine and finally got the Wennington
Hall's" boat back to the steps, where he
took out half the load and then made two
successful trips.
The bark Columbia was offered a tow by
the tu_ Vigilant, but refused. Half an
hour later the master bad to wear ship
and stand off shore in order to save him
self from going on the rocks.
Information signals have been ordered
displayed all along the California coast
from Point Reyes r.ortb for high southeast
gales shifting to southwest.
ANOTHER OCEAN DISASTER
The Columbia, Bound From Swan-
sea to O'egon, a Total Loss.
Another ocean disaster has to be re
corded. A telegram from Bueno3 Ayres
to the Merchants' Exchange states that
the British ship Columbia, from Swansea
to Oregon to load wneat, was totally lost
on Cape Blanco. The captain and crew
were saved.
The barber on the Oceanic Steamship
Company's Monowai isbewailiig tie Joss
of several bottles of cologne, quite a quan
tity of cosmetics, several razors and other
accessories to his department. Some one
got into his quarters last Saturday night
and looted the shop. Sergeant Tom Ma
honey of the harbor police is at work on
the case.
Bert Fanning was charged with battery
at the Harbor police station yesterday. A
commercial agent named Julius Thall of
129b Oak street had been annoyin, Far
ming's sister, and the latter resented it.
He administered a sound thrashing to the
festive agent, and Thall had him arrested.
Fanning was not placed iv a ceil, but sat
with the prison-keeper until he secured
bail. Thali bousts of having a "pull"
with the police and says Fanning will be
convicted.
The whaling bark John and Winthrop,
which got in Sunday night from the
Arctic, had an unfortunate voyage. As
foreshadowed in the private letter pub
lished in The Call some weeks ago, the
bark had more than her share of trouble.
Not a whale was taken, five men deserted,
Thomas Keogh froze to death, Samuel
Spotlord had his feet frozen so badly that
one of them had to be amputated, Richard
Brook, the cabin-boy, died of consump
tion and William Mozier, the second mate,
died of dropsy. All in all, it was a most
disastrous voyage.
The following "notice to mariners" has

The Well-Digger Dead.
William Kennedy, the well-digger who had
his skull fractured by a crowbar last Friday,
died at the City and County Hospital yester
day morning. Ho was employed in digging a
well on the Mission road when he called to his
helper to lower a crowbar. He was sixty feet
beli>w the surface and while the crowbar was

DIVORCE GRANTED
COLONEL MARCEAU
Judge Slack Allowed It on
the Ground of Deser
tion.
No Mention Made of the Ma
loiiey Incident in the
Testimony.
THE WIFE NOW IN NEW YORK
Property Divided According to an
Agreement Mad: Between the
Principals.
The marital troubles of Colonel Theo
dore C. Marceau and his wife were ended
yesterday by Judge Slack, who granted
the photographer a divorce on the ground
of willful desertion.
The domestic woes of the Marceaus have
furnished a fruitful subject for local gos
sips for a long time, and the doings of the
wife produced no end of sensation in
March last, when the husband, accom
panied by several friends, burst in the
door of her apartments at the Palace Ho
tel and found her in company with J. H.
Maloney, a Canadian horseman.
Mrs. Amanda J. Marcean's name was
Fisher, she being the daughter of a
wealthy resident of Fresno. She was first
married to a theatrical manager named
Fisk, but was widowed. When wedded to
Colonel Marceau in 1891 she was the
mother of two young children, one of
which subsequently died at sea while the
family was en route to South America.
When the suit for divorce was filed
charges of infidelity were made by the
plaintiff, Dut they were subsequently with
drawn, and in an amended complaint wili
fui desertion was charged. The charge was
founded upon an occurrence which came
to pas 3in Indianapolis in Septem
ber, 1895. While there, the colonel says,
he was out until aooiu 11 o'clock one even
ing on business, and on returning to his
hotel found his baggage in the hallway
outside the door of his apartments. There
was also a message from his wife, an
nouncing that she wished to have no more
to do with him. Since that time, it is
said, marital relations have never been re
sume:!.
Some â¢ time ago an agreement was
reached whereby the pronerty of the un
happy pair was divided, it being rumored
that the wife paid het husband $40,000 to
release a claim he had on her Fresno prop
erty.
Mrs. Marceau is now in New York.
THE AFFILIATED COLLEGES.

adoption of a resolution in open session
of the board last Saturday these regents,
constituting a majority of the committee
on building and grounds, proceeded to
sign the original contracts and the modi
fied contracts for constructing buildings

Some inquiry was made to ascertain if
certain sureties were responsible and did
actually own valuable real estate. Little
time was lost in discussion. When the
papers were signed they were sent to the
law office of Major Mhoon. After ap
proval by the State Board of Examiners
the documents must receive the favorable
indorsement of the Attorney-General. It
may not be necessary to send the papers to

KING McMANUS
AMONG THE DEAD
The Former Ruler of the
Potrero Succumbs
to Dropsy.
He Was Once a Powerful Factor
in the Politics of This
County.
HOW HE LOST A THRONE.
The Murder of His Favorite Brother
Drove Him to Drink and to
a Premature Grave.
Frank McManus is dead.
As "King of the Potrero" he was once a
power in the political arena of this County.
His boarding-house was the resort and
home of the men from the slaughter-
The Late Frank McManus, Known as the " King of the Potrero."
houses of Butchertown and the laborers l
from the shipyards and the Union Iron
Works.
A powerful man physically, he was the
terror of his guests when he chose to dom- |
mate and control them; still, when in his j
better mood, his generosity and urbane j
manner won back to him the friends he >
lost when in his tantrums.
The "King," as McManns has been j
Known for years, held the scepter and
wielded it in the Potrero until the Welch
boys moved over there and ran a rival j
house. The Welch boys had gone there
to stay and the King ordered them to
leave. The clash came. Jack Welch and
McManus met, fought and the throne was !
toppled. They met again, and again the i
King fell. Thrice this occurred, each
time with the same result, and the Welch
boys ruled.
The climax came when Cornelias Me-
Manus, a brother of the King, came
over here from Ireland. Bent upon re- !
seating hi 3 royal relative, he went forth I
to meet the Welch faction. In the first j
scrimmage the "Gossoon," as Cornelius
was known, shot Jack Welch in the side, i
almost removing tne vanquisher of his I
brother to the great beyond. Welch re- *
covered, however, and was magnanimous j
enough to refuse to prosecute his as- i
dailant.
Shortly after that the Gossoon mixed '
matters with a bas^ball-piayer named i
Sweeney. The latter is now servinz a ten j
years' sentence in San Quentin lor man- I
slaughter and the Gossoon lies in a grave ,
at Cypress Lawn Cemetery.
Frank McManus never got over the |
death of his brotter. He sought solace In
drink, and his once magnificent physique
fell a wfty to a mere skeleton of his former
self.
About one year ago dropsy set in upon
him. and he had been under the care of
physicians from that time until the mo- ;
ment of his death.
One week ago he sold a half interest in
his Third-street liquor-house to an old J
iriendâ George A. Ginn â who at one time
was known as the "Mayor of Sausalito."
Believing his interests safe in the hands
of his partner he hied himsell to the home
of his brother James, an undertaker in j
Oakland.
It was at the latter's home be died |
yesterday afternoon, during Â«n operation '
in which he was being "tapped."
McManus was born in County Leitrim,
Ireland, in 1850. In 1882 he located per
manently in this County. He leaves a !
widow and a son 13 years old, also his I
brothers, James, Patrick, William, and a j
nephew named Terrence McManus.
The funeral will be held Wednesday
morning. _ m ____________

WOMAN'S CLUB BUILDING
The Press Association Will Erect
a Beautiful Structure
Soon.
It Will Be the Headquarters for All
ot the Literary Ladies of
This Locality.
The Pacific Coast Women's Press Asso
ciation is preparing to locate ,ln perma
nent headquarter*. To do so 1 , according
to the present plans, will hivolve the
erection of a fine structure that w'll be
called the Women's Clnb building, and
' will cost not less than $100,000. At a re
cent meeting a committee, consisting of
Mrs. P. T. Dickinson, Mrs. M. B. Foster
and Mrs. Laura Y. Pinnie, was appointed
to take charge of the arrangements. An
attempt was made to secure a building on
Geary street, near Povrell, in which altera
tions would have to be made, but the cost
thereof and the landlord's terms were too
high.
This left nothing to do but to arrange
for a new building to be constructed to
suit. This will be located well downtown.
! While no plans lor the structure have been
made the ladies have decided on the main
features. There will be reading-rooms
and a larae library, the nucleus of which
is already in Ihe possession of the associa
tion. Tne arrangements will all be of the
modern order. In order to secure and
hold property the association will be in
corporated at once. â 
The members of the association do not
propose to occupy the building entirely by j
themselves. The committee has been |
authorized to call upon the officers of all i
the Indie*' literary societies and clubs in i
the City and ask that their organizations
make the Woman's Club Building their
home, for the structure will be so arranged
that a dozen ladies' clubs can be housed
under tbe one roof. Among the organiza
tions to be invited are the Daughters of
tne Rebellion, the Colonial Dames, the
Sorosis Club, the Laurel Hill Club and
others.
The intention is to make it strictly a
women's building, similar to those in
Chicago, Philadelphia and New York. It
will also be a headquarters for all literary
women from abroad, and invitations will
be extended to all lady visitors to this City
to make the Woman's Club building their

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1896.
THE OFFICIAL MAP
HAS BEEN VETOED,
Mayor Sutro Does Not Ap
prove of Surveyor
Tilton's Bill.
He Claims That the Terms of the
Contract Have Not Been
Carried Out.
JEROME HILLABD COMPLAIN?.
Judge Low Claimed to Hive Author
ized Exorbitant Fees for
Interpreters.
Mayor Sutro surprised the Board of Sn*
pervieorM yesterday when he vetoed the
order of the board authorizing the pay
ment to City and County Surveyor Tilion
of $7000 as final payment on the otlicial
map recently ordered.
The Mayor's reasons for the veto are
that the public has not had time to look
into the matter and that the terms of the
contract have not been strictly adhered to.
The Mayor in his message made the
following suggestions:
Firstâ That the map, when fully completed,
be placed on exhibition lor the period of mxty
days, ami that the public be invited to exam
ine the same for any and all defects.
Secondâ That your body authorize me to ap
point some competent and wholly disinter
ested surveyor to thoroushly inspect the map,
to verify allot its utatemeiits and to report
tnerecn in writingr, within such sixty days, as
to its accuracy and completeness.
When the public has lind this opportunity I
for the time mimed and such surveyor has re- |
ported, and the map has stood this reasonable
scrutiny, then the claim can be presented for I
final payment and the map can, by resolution,
be with certainly accepted as official.
Your attention is respectfully pointed to
the fact that the contract called for "the per
lorm&nee ot the above mentioned work on or
before the Ist day of October, 1800."
This claim is dated Octooer 12, 189G, and
the authorization was passed October ID, 1890.
It is understood from the statements of the
engineer and his deputies that the map is not
yet completed for actual delivery.
Hence it might be questioned if anything is
now due.
Jerome Mil lard presented a protest to
the board , calling attention to the exor
bitant fees paid to Chinese interpreters
in the Police courts. He says that the
City is annually mulcted of an immense
sum by this means.
The protest is probably the outgrowth
of the recent friction between Millard
and Judge Lowe, whom the interpreter I
recently characterized as being an advo- i
rate of Chinese cheap labor. As a result I
Millard was indicted for line!, but was dis- I
charged by Judge Wallace.
D. S. Weaver applied to the board for
permission to take possession of certain j
materials and fixtures furnished the City,
alleging that he has never been paid for
the stuff. The Finance Committee de
cided that it could not grant the reqnest,
forlack of Jurisdiction, although the mcm
i bers Baid thatpersonally they would will
ingly do so, as they believe he has been 1
defrauded of his due.
It was decided to raise the license im
posed on ticket brokers from $10 per
quarter tosioo per month.
The Health and I'olice Committee was
authorized to spend $600 in piirciiasing
instruments for the Receiving Hospital.

JOHN MULLAN'S CLAIM.
Supreme Court Decides It Is Not Baaed
on Legal Acts. â  - ,
The ' Supreme Court - has affirmed the
judement of the^Snperior Court in sus
taining the demurrer in the I suit of John
Mulian against the State of California.
This r lias !> been a lamous action. Mul
lan brought suit : against the '] State, alleg
ing that between } December 12.1878, and
March 1, 1891, he rendered services to the
State, at its tpecial request and instance.
This alleged; service consisted in recover
ing 1216,357 37. paid to \ the United States
under the act of Congress of - August 5,
18C1. Mulian claimed that he ; was entitled
to 20 per. cent of this money j but the State
Board of Examiners ; refused i to allow the |
claim either. wholly or in part.*: - â 
":; Superior Court sustained the . de
murrer, /which claimed that 1: the alleged
employment of Mullan was unauthorized
and created no valid obligation against
the State. : . :â â  ,'â â  Â'â  -; ;'.. â â .'; ; : "- ; ; :"
â¢ Whether Million was leeally employed
is inquired into by Justice Van Vleet, who
wrote the opinion of the Supreme Court,
Justices Harrison I and Garroutte concur
ring. His conclusions arcs that "there
could be no valid employment of plaintiff
by the State for the purpose alleged with
out authorization by the Legislature."

"UNDER WHICH FUG"
The Eloquent Priest Lec
tures for Holy Cross
Church.
I He Scores the A. P. A., the Mer
chants' Association and the
j - Charter.
HE IS NOT IN POLITICS.
Says He Would Not Indicate to Any
American Citizen How He
Should Vote.
"Under Which Flag?"
To the usual big audience emrjloying
the full capacity of the big hall, Rev.
â¢Father Yorke lectured upon this topic, or
under this title, last evening at Metropoli
â¢ tan Temple. After J. J. Dwyer's felicitous
little speech of introduction Professor
Martinez rendered a piano solo, followed
by M. D. Manlloyd, a tenor â¢010, "Eileen
Mavourneen" ; Professor Giulio Minetti,
a violin solo, "Elegie"; Miss Julia Cotte,
aoprano solo, "Farlo," and then "Under
Which Flag?"
The lecture was for the benefit of the
. church fund of old Holy Cross, formerly
8U Patrick and St. John's, ana Mr. Dwyer
took occasion to pay a timely compliment
to the pastor, Father McGinty, the men
tion of whose name called out a warm
burst of applause.
The staee was graced with a profusion
. of bright flowers and a liberal display of
American flags â enough to clearly indi
cate "under which flag."
.. â  The introduction by Hon. J. J. Dwyer
to be sure had got the audience on tiptoe,
earning him as the fearless leader of the
fieht against bigotry and intolerance.
Father Yorke referred good-naturedly
to the encomiums of the chairman, and
. then sounht the indulgence of the audi
ence for one of his "preludes." Assent
being signified by laughter and applause,
the lecturer took the occasion to "take a
fall" out of his especial antipathy, Rev. D.
M.Ross. Then he reierred to the Merchants'
Association, saying that that body hau re
cently sent circulars to the different coun
â¢cils of the A. P. A., asking: them to put
watchers at tht polls in the interest of the
charter. He wanted to know if the Mer
chants' Association could not get decent
men for such work; why "they should po
down into the sewers of society" for their
assistants. "I may use your name;" he
said, - 'in which to demand an answer."
The hrst rounded period of the lecture
unfurled the two flags to be touched upon
*in the lecture, "the black flag of intoler
ance" and the "bright, starry flag of free
dom."
The lecture was another of Father
Yorke's onslaughts upon the A. P. A. He
wondered again that such a society, hav
ing for its purpose the repeal of the
first article of the constitution â the
guarantee that citizens of this Republic
may worship their God when and how
- they please; that such a society should
not only be permitted to exist but could
flourish in this tha closing days of the
nineteenth century. Such a wonder be
came possible, he said, through the
cowardice of newspapers and politicians
who feared to speak out and denounce
what they knew to be evil.
He said tl>e comins election would prove
a test of the strength of this society ; that
it bad its candidates for principal
' officers and its members were working
'tooth and naii for their success. They
had within the past few months been
.-lashed into decency and forced back into
the darkness whence they had come, but
if they were successful they would come
â forth again, bold and arrogant, and heap
'â¢their tilth upon the devored head of
Catholicism. The society had been
whipped into silence and decency because
the great majority of the people, Catholic
and Protesttmt alike, were shown to be
against it. But this society was not only
an anti-Catholic societyâ a society that is
pledged to oppose any Catholic for public
..office for no other reason than that he is a
Catholic â but it is a secret political society
with the purpose af electing candidates of
their choice. It is un-American to the
. iast degree.
He called upon his hearers to mark the
men not only who were avowed members
of that society, but every man who had
.been indorsed by it.
"If ycu stand by your flag, my hearers,
'.we will, upon next Tuesday, have seen the
. last of the A. P. A. It will have been
buried beyond resurrection and peace will
come and bigotry and intolerance will no
1 .more raise their heads in this City.
â¢ ."We have indeed the signs of these good
times at hand. I never knew there were
bo many Catholics until after the nomina
tions of all the several parties in this
campaign. Every one of them have pro
â¢tiuced evidence that tbpy at least had a
'Catholic grandmother. [Laughter.] It is
amusing to see how these fellows seem to
believe that because their aunt's cousin
was distantly related to some one who
. knew how to make the sign of the cross,
â¢11 good Catholics should fall on their
.' necks and cling to them as long lost
brothers." [Laughter.]
The speaker then referred to and de
plored dissensions within their own ranks
and called upon his hearers to unite and
f.iand by their flag.
i "It has been said that I had, or was
about to, advocate the election of this or
that candidate," said the speaker. "I
wish to lake this opportunity to deny it.
I would not be likely to descend into the
filthy pool of politics. I would sooner see
. a member of the A. P, A. in every office in
the City, from Mayor to ponndmaster,
than much as move my little finper
toward dictating a vote to any American
citizen. If the A. P. A. candidates are
elected you have yourselves to blame â
. certainly lam not to biame. [Laughter.]
If we are beaten, however, it simply means
that we must take off ourcoaisfor two
jears more. It mu3t be admitted that
lighting does not disagree with us.
[Laughter.]
"I have said that the Catholic voter is
the freest voter on earth, and I repeat it.
"I have said that no Catholic priest
ever would undertake to interfere with
. any manlin the exercise of his franchise,
, and I repeat it. I declare that the people
are fully capable of running their secular
affairs. I will say, however, as I have a
right to, that no Catholic snould help to
"place in authority any man pledged to or
supported by that dark lantern brigade,
the American Protective Association. I
will say further that all of the candidates
for the Mayoralty save one are fighting
â 'under the banner of freedom."
The speaker also spoke strongly against
the proposed new charter and called upon
his hearers to vote against it. He said it
had been made in a hurry by men many
of whom were in no wise fitted for the
lask.
â¢ In a telling peroration the speaker
galled upon his hearers to enlist under the
Jbanner of liberty and freedom, the stars
w-i'i stripes, and oppose intolerance and
%il would be well.

FORTUNE WON BY ERROR
The Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany Falls a Victim to a
Technicality.
How the Clerk of a Court Swears to
One Tiling When the Records
Show Another.
Mrs. Nellie Phinney of Portland, execu
trix of the estate of Gay C. Phinney, ob
tained a peculiar but substantial victory
in the United States Court of Appeals yes
terday. Through the fault of some one â
said to be A. Reaves Ayer?, clerk of the
United States Circuit Court for the District
of Washingtonâ the right of the Mutual
Life Insurance Company to be heard by
the Court of Appeals in an action involv
ing $98,000 was denied and tue suit pr
dered dismissed.
The facts leading up to this unexpected
climax and the condition which brought
about the original suit may be briefly tpld
as follows: Some months before his death
Guy C. Phinney of Portland injured his
liie for $100,000. When the widow made a
demand for the money the company re
fused payment, alleging misrepresenta
tion on the part of the deceased. A suit
to recover the face of the policy, less the
premium dne, was instituted by Mrs.
Phinney in the Circuit Court of Washing
ton, the company finally los ng.
Notice of an appeal was at once given
and the writ of error later placed in pos
session of the clerk of the court, A. Reaves
Avers. When the papers finally reached
the clerk of the Court of Appeals it was
discovered by Mrs. Phinney'rf attorney,
Lorenzo S. B. Sawyer, that the writ of
error had never been riled With the clerk
of the Washington court. At least there
was no recoru or such act on the docu
ment itself. At the June session of the
Court of Appeals Mr. Sawyer moved to
dismiss the entire action on the ground
that no proper or legal citation on the
writ of error had been issued or served,
and further that the writ had not been
filed with the court below.
The court took tne matter under advise
ment and yesterday a majority of that
body, Judges Ross aDd Hawley, rendered
an opinion sustaining the contention of
Mrs. Phinney's attorney, and ordering the
action dismissed with costs to the plaintiff
in error. Judge Gilbert returned a dis
senting opinion, to the effect that the in
dorsement on the writ of ci ror of the cleric
in tne lower court was not essential. The
fact that he had the document in his dos
session was till that was necessary.
It was stated yesterday that the failure
of the clerk of the lower court to place his
indorsement on the writ of error would
probably cause that gentleman no end of
trouble, if the insurance people see proper
to push their claim. Mr. Ayers has mado
effidavit that the writ of error was riled,
though the document itself gives no evi
dence of this. In the meantime the com
pany may take an appeal to the Supreme
Court, asking that body to order the Courc
of Appeals to review the case.
Opinions were also rendered in the fol
lowing cases yesterday:
Southern Pacific Railroad, plaintiS in error,
vs. Dnvid R. Brown, defendant in error, peti
tion for rehearing denied.
J. J. Hennessy et al., piaintift' in error, vs.
H. S. Bond, defendant iv error, judgment of
lower court affirmed with costs.
S. S. Bailey, plaintiff in error, vs. H. S. Bond,
defendant in error; judgment of lower court
affirmed with costs.

The Tufts-Lyons Nine Claim
They Are Entitled to
His Services.
MUDDLE IN BASIBALLCIBCLES.
The LO3 Angeles Team Will Play
Next Sunday Without Their
Phenomenal Pitcher.
The excitement over the baseball game
Sunday at Central Park between the
Tufts- Lyons nine of Los Angeles and the
Monograms of Oregon is growing with
every moment that passes.
The lads on either side of the homeplate
have friends galore divided into even rad
clamorous camps, aud, while the bitter
ness so recently engendered is developing
into unlooked for proportions, it promises
well for an unprecedented throng at the
next meeting on Sunday.
Tiie same two teams that acquitted
themselves so well at the former meeting;
will meet again, and it will be "for blood,"
sure enough, this time. The people know
that, and, preferring that kind of play to
the methodical and perfect action" of
trained professionals, they will test the
capacity of Central Park more than it has
ever been, making it so much better for
the charitable fund to which the dollars
are to be devoted.
The existing trouble between the Tufts-
Lyons nine of Los Angeles and the man-
ERVIN K. HARVEY, the Lad Who Is Said to Be Too Old to
Play in the Baseball Tournament. His Manager, M. M.
Shields, of the Los Angeles Tufts-Lyons Club.
agement of tbe series of games is clean
cut. The Examiner people refused to
allow Harvey, the phenomenal pitcher
from the south, to assume the box in
which he has repeatedly played since the
tournament began. They claim he has
passed the age limit of 18 years and 6
months and is not entitled to recognition.
The Tu:ts- Lyons nine declare that this
is wrong and have demanded of the pro
testors that evidence be produced show
ing Harvey to be over-aged. This so far
has not materialized, even in the face of
the evidence the nine haa presented that
Harvey is not yet 18 years old.
As Manaser Shields states, "It's a poor
mother and father who can't tell the ago
of their owq child, and here is the affi
davit Harvey's parents have sworn to be
fore a' notary as to his riebt age" :
James C. Harvey and Clara A, Harvey, being
duly sworn, say: That they are residents of
ihecity and county of Los Angeles. State of
California, that formerly they resided in the
town of Saratoga, county of Santa Clara, State
of California, and that they so resided during
the year- from 1974 to 1880, inclusive; that
Ervin K. Harvey is their son and was born i:\
said town of Saratoga on January 5, 1879, aud
that, therefore, he will not be 18 years of age
until the sth day of January, 1897.
Furthermore, they affirm that the aforesaid
Ervin K. Harvey is the same person who is a
member of the Tufts-Lyons Arms Baseball
Club, and as such member played in a contest
between said Tufts-Lyons Arms Club and the
Alameda Alerts Baseball Club on Saturday,
the 12th day oi September, 1896.
In witness whereof, the deponents have
hereunto set their hands and seals this 14th
day of October, 1896.

"This trouble." Manager Shields of the
Los Angeles nine stated last evening,
"dates tjack to the game the Tufts-Lyons
played with and won from tne Alerts of
Alamoda by a score of 12 to 1 on Septem
ber 12 of this year. Within twenty-four
hours, the regulation time, a protest was
entered ngainst Charles Franck, our short
stop, claiming he was over age.
*'No one else was protested against, al
though Harvey pitched for us then ns he
has ever since," excepting on Sunday last.
Franck, however, proved his age to be
within the limit and he has since been re
inftated.
"About one week after the Franck epi
sode a protest was entered against the en
tiro team, a thing which was clear beyond
the right and power of any person, as the
National League rules limit the time for
protests to twenty-four hours. At this
time, however, Mr. Burke, then the man
ager of the nine, sent in a correct list of
ages of all the lads.
"A month later, for the first time, we
learned through the press dispatcnes that
Harvey was disqualified. If he was re
tired honestly, so should have been the
entire nine. We immediately asked that
Harvey be reinstated and furnished evi
dence to the effect he was of proper age in
support of our request. No answer was
made to this, and ever since they have re
fused to let us see the evidence upon
which the disqualification was based.
"Sunday we submitted to the arbitrary
ruling and played ins bast game ever wit
nessed in this State. We first offered to
give the game to the Monograms provid
inc they allowed us to pJay~Harvey. We
did not want to disappoint the thousands
of people who had come to see the game,
and we wanted to show them we could
play ball.
"We have no desire to fool or humbug
tbe public by putting in our nine any
player riot justly entitled to be there. As
to the cup, trophy or 'collar,' whatever
name you may call it, we.do not care for
the thing, but we do care to have the
public see us play with tbe lull and iegiti
mate strength of our nine. With Harvey,
we believe we are invincible, but if we
can't have him we believe we can defeat
the Monograms anyhow."
The local managers of the baseball
tournament chaperoned the Alonograms
and the Tufts-Lyons iast evening to the
performance at the Columbia and to a late
lunch at Norman's. At the former place
Manager Friedlander made the rival clubs
comfortable in the four lower proscenium
boxes, where they enjoyed an ex
cellent show, and for the time being fur
got that there bad ever been a controversy
between or about them.
In speaking of the points of difference
which have been raised, both the local
managers denied tiiat there was tbe
slightest degree of iavoritism shown any
particular team.
"There is this about the affair," said one
of them. "Tlie Examiner will have to
put up about $18,000 this year for the hos
pital, and we propose grabbing every dol
lar in sight and laying it away in advance.
We are not making a cent of money out
of this thing ourselves, and we have no
reason to antagonize the Los Angeles peo
ple or to favor those of Portland.
"We want this tournament to bÂ» played
out on fair-play rules especially, although
the National League rules will be abided
by on the field unless we see that they are
not in accord with ourrule3. For instance,
the National League rules require an
umpire to continue throughout the game,
and we reserve the right and power to put
him off the field at any time we deem his
removal necessary.
"When we gathered these boys to play
ball we inaugurated a private system to
determine their proper ages. The age
limit was 18 years and 6 months. Well, by
means of our own we discovered that Har
vey was at least 18 years and 11 months
old, notwithstanding affidavits to the con
trary. As a matter of fact I don't believe
in the affidavits of mothers and fathers in
these cases. See tbe Flemminz case back
East, where even the tombstone on the
grave of Flemming's twin sister was de
stroyed so as to hide his age. No, sir; I
will accept no affidavits as to Harvey's
age. I will rely only on our own investi-
gations, and, as I told Manager Shields of
the Tufts- Lyons, L will produce evidence
that the disqualification of Harvey is but
just when the Los Angeles team "will be
ready to return home."
THE THREE CHAMPIONS.
Pertinent Comments by Nevada
Papers About the Interstate
Baseball Management.
There are now three clubs remaining
undefeated and champions, of their re
spective States. They are the Monograms
of Oregon, the Stars of Nevada and the
Tufts-Lyons of California.
Two of these clubs at least are chafing
under gross injustice visited upon them.
The Tufts-Lyons, as already published,
show how an injustice was done them
when Harvey was disqualified from assum
ing the box without first having been
given a hearing as to his right to pitch
last Sunday in the paina nesting the Mon
ograms. In addition to this they are chaf
ing under the arbitrary rule or order given
by the Examiner to close the day's play
with a tie game when, after twelve innings,
the Monograms were permitted to co to
bat in the beginning of the thirteenth and
have one man â Dunovan â put out at first.
The Stars likewise are angered, and
behind them voicing their grievance is the
press of Nevada. A few comments made
on the methods used during this series of
interstate games were gathered by the
Daily Territorial Enterprise of Virginia,
Nev., and are reproduced here under the
original caption:
THE FAKER'S POLICY.
STILL TRYING TO BULLDOZE THE STARS INTO
PLAYING.
The edition of the monarch of the fakers to
reach us yesterday contains two coluruns of
fine type and some pictures calculated to be
funny, the subject of which is its jobbed base
bull tournament. The Examiner evidently
believes that by its slurs ami caricatures it
can drive the Stars to play the winning team
of next Sunday'agame, out the Stars are made
of different stuff. They will not recogn:ze the
Tufts-Lyons combination as champions in the
monarch tournament, but will piny the Los
Angeles team for a purse or gate receipts.
Should the Monograms win, then the Stars
will play them a game for the final champion
ship, provided they could set some guarantee
that they would be treated fairly by the Ex
aminer.
The boys have small faith in any promises
the schemers of the Examiner may hold forth
and will probably demand some satisfactory
guarantee of fair play. The Examiner jobbers
who have the baseball tournament in charge
evidently do not know what "fair play" means.
The Examiner to reach us yesterdny says:
This contest is the final one for the trophy in
the great championship tournamentâ that is
if the Nevada Stars adhere to their determina
tion to rest where tb*y are. Los Angeles is
kending the champion band oi this State to
meet the spellbinders of Oregon, aud the win
ners of this game will keep open house for the
Stars, provided those Indians conclude to
leave the reservation for another ghost dance
at Central fork.
The Winnemucca Silver State says: The
Nevada Stars Baseball Club has returned
ho'.ne. having declined to play the Los
Angeles team to decide the California-Nevada
championship. It is a fair sample of California
unfairness ior the Examiner to require the
Nevada team to meet two California teams
when but one could be champion of Culifor
fornia. The Examiner evidently intends to
keep the trophy in California if possible. The
action taken by the Stars, of course, lets them
out of the right for the championship, but they
have proven that ihey know how to play ball
better than California's best, and would have
an excellent show for the const championship
but for the unsportsmanlike stand taken by
the Examiner.
The Oregon champion* are to meet the Los
Anseles team at San Francisco next Buuday.
If the Oregon boys win we predict that they
will be compelled to meet the defeated Alerts,
as tbe programme is to give Calitornia two
chances for the prize wnere any other State
I has only one.
ROYAL HAWAIIANS
VISIT MR. FOSTER
They Oppose Any Foreign
Flag Over Their
Country.
The Ex-Secretary Is Presented
With an Address on
the Peru.
ASKED TO FAVOR NATIVES.
"When Americans Want the Union
Jack Then Kanakas Will Want
a Foreign Banner."
Just before ex-Secretary Foster sailed
for Honolulu on the Peru yesterday he
was visited by a committee from the
Royal Hawaiian band, whose purpose was
to invite him to talk with their country
men fully on the status of Hawaiian af
fairs before expressing an opinion favor
able to annexation.
Mr. Foster graciously received the com
mittee and heard what it had to say,
promising to be fair in his hearing of
matters of a political nature. Just as the
Peru sailed, to make its purpose more ex
plicit, the' committee banded Mr. Foster
the following letter:
San Francisco. Oct. 20, 1396. t
Hon. John W. Foster, San Francisco, Ca'.â Sir:
You were Secretary of State in the Cabinet of
President Harrison, when, early in 1893, a
treaty was negotiated by you, on behalf of the
United States, with certain gentlemen tiro
fessing to represent .the Government of the
Hawaiian Islands, the object of which treaty
was the absorption of our native land, and the
extinction of the Hawaiian nation, by the
United States. "You are now on your way to
Honolulu, and reports and interviews pub
lished in the press of thi3 City represent you
as being bent upon the further promotion of
the project of annexation, which was stayed
by the act of President Cleveland, out of re
gard for the political rights and desires of the
Hawaiian people.
We are uative Hawaiians, members of the
musical organization formerly existing under
the name of the Royal Hawaiian Band. We
are absent from our native land against our
desire, having been denied the privilege of
earning n livelihood in the land of our birth,
by the usurping and non-represeniative party
who, since January 17, 1893, have ruled
Hawaii at the po'lntof the bayonet, such de
nial being based upon our refusal to swear alle
giance to the usurpers, and to forswear the
forms of government under which we were
born, and had always lived, until the date
named, and which had existed in Hawaii from
time immemorial.
We assume and believe that in your rela
tionship to the treaty mentioned you acted in
ignorance of the conditions existing in Ha
waii, of the means by which the party then
claiming to be the Government of and seeking
to convey our country to a foreign nation, ob
tained their lease of power; and of tho true
sentimeats of the people justly entitled to
siH'tiU for Hawaii >ipon the subject of its ab
sorption by the United States. We therefore
welcome the prospect of your visit to our
country at this time, and trust you will hold
yourself in a receptive mood for the acquiring
hi information upon the true condition of
Hawaiian sentiment concerning political an
nexation to America. And we hava every
confidence, in view of your known reputation
as a promoter of political equality and justice,
and as an advocate and exemplar of true re
publican principles of government, that you
will not, after learning the sentiments of the
Hawaiian people upon this momentous ques
tion, further seek to have imposed upon them
apolitical condition from which they shrink
with dread and with grave forebodings as to
its etlect upon their future as a people.
The proverbial devotion of the American
people to- the principle expressed by your
President Linco.n, of a "government oi the
people, by the people and for the people,"
shou'd, we humbly submit, now suggest to
this great Nation the propriety of d-ierring
any turther steps looking toward the political
annexation oi Hr.waii until the will oi the
1 qualified voters of our country, as tested by
the constitutional urovisions existing January
17, 1893, shall have been formally registered
through the medium of a plebiscite.
With sincere wishes for your health and en
joyment upon your proposed trip, we remain,
bir, on behalf of the band.. yours very truly,
Jof. K. Kaava,
Sol A. Hiram,
Joseph Ala,
Samcel K. Kamakaia,
John aiu.
Mr. Kamakaia, one of the leading spirits
of the band, said, relative to the matter:
"Our people do not want annexation.
They prefer a chance to get some of their
friends in power some day and cast their
fortunes with their own country rather
than become an annex to your country.
To-day we have our own flag and tradi
tions, our own constitution, laws and in
stitutions.
"Do you think we want to be regarded
a? a sort of Indian agency, and that we
want to be referred to as wards of your
nation, to be fought over by the Bryans
and McKinleys? Never, so long as there
is Hawaiian blood in our. veins; never, so
long as love of country lives. We are no
more anxious to see your flag flying over
us than you are to sec a foreign flag in
your native land. A man who wonders
at our sentiment ought to ask himself
how he would like to have the Union
Jack floating over America ."

DANGER IN DISGUISE,
The SerioaS Troubles That May Come
Upon People at This Time of Year.
''Oh, it's only a cold."
Such a remark as this is often heard at
this time o: Â»he year, when the weather is
chilly. The people who make such a re
mark seem to forget that a cold is really a
dangerous condition of the system, a weak
spot, a disease. A coli may lead toa cough,
and then to pneumonia, or it may sow the
seeds of consumption. For this reason it
is dangerous to neglect a cold. It is better
to stamp it out at once. Fortunately there
is one means of doing this that is always
safe and reliable. What it is and what it
will do can be seen from the following:
Mr. M. O. Connor, '271 Scott st., Brook
lyn, says: "Some time ago I was stricken
down with congest on of the lungs, and,
though havtnc: the best medical attend
ance, I did not improve. I had a cough
that seemed to contract my chest to ball
.its naiural size. I was in constant pain,
and had no rest day or night. At last I
was advised to try Duffy's pure malt whis
key, and it effected a speedy cure. The
lun^ trouble and cough entirely disap
peared, my appetite was regained, and
breathing became as natural as ever. I
now feel like a new man all over."
No ordinary whiskey could have pro
duced these unusual results. As a means
of building up the system and restoring
the health, Duffy's pure malt has always !
been unequaled. If it were kept in every
household, and used in all cases of emerg
ency, a vast amount of sickness and suf
fering could be entirely prevented.
You'll always buy
'em once you try
'em, and you'll
recommend them
to others.

A Dog Finds an Interesting
Letter Hidden in the
Sand.
Written on the Battle- Fie'd
Many Years Ago to a Com
rade's Widow.
SHOWS THE SOLDIER SPIRIT.
A Tragic Event of "64 That Occurred
Near the Enemy's Lines on a
Quiet Sunday Evening;.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 26. )
An interesting chapter of life during the
exciting times when the veterans of to-day
were young men was unearthed to-day.
While a dog was pawing in the sand be
neath an old house occupied by Mr. Clune
on Sixth street he brought to light a letter.
No one in the neighborhood knew how
long it had been buried in the sand, which
had preserved it perfectly, nor does any
one know any of the parties mentioned.
â¢ It is a letter to a soldier's widow from the
.comrade of a soldier who was accidentally
killed while crossing a creek while his
regiment was in camp at Decaiur, Ga., in
1864, waiting for what the writer very aptly
called "the tug of war." Just how the
letter came to be hidden under a house in
Oakland is a mystery, but the story it con
tains will doubtless revive many memories
of old veterans who read it.
It 13 as follows:
In Camp at Decatub, Ga., j
September, 13. 18G4. j
My Dear Friend: If lam the last in condol
ing, I do most faithfully assure you that it Is
not insensibility, but the highest degree of
love and gratitude that occasioned it, ' and 1
hope you will not impute my long silence to
any want, but to an excess of kindness. When
I took the tied three years ago this month I
was but little acquainted with Oscar, but be
fore his death I learned to love him as my
brother. He was in the same brigade through
the East Tennessee camuaign. At Knoxvllle
we were together almost daily, and I presume
he has mentioned me in his letters more than
once. 1 visited him many times in this cam
paign. He was ordnance sergeant ana 1 was
chief of the caisson.
At the time the sad accident happened our
battery was some 5000 yards to the rear ot the
104 th. We were advancing and drivine the
enemy before us ail that day (Sunday, 17th of
Ju y). That night we went into camp only a
few rods from where the accident happened.
We all picked blackberries that evening in the
same bushes that we picked in before Oscar
was shot. There was what the Tennesseeans
call a branchâ what we would call a creek or
brook in Ohioâ to cross from where the 104 th
was to the blackberries. He crossed on a
small log to the bushes, and the accident hap
pened when he was going back.
The knowledge of the accident came to me
In this wise. One Harry Thompson, of Hud
son, Ohio, came to me and asked if I knew
that the sergeant of thelO4th was killed. I
asked him what sergeant, an i he said the one
that I went with so much. I asked him if it
was Sergeant Jackson (for I began to fear it
was him) and he said it was. I met one of the
104 th boys and he confirmed the report and
cave me the details so iar as he knew. .Martha
says she is very lonely and, I hope you will
maJre her a long visit. -. â '- â  -' â â¢â  - -
You tnus". not spend the remainder of your
days in mourning, but being -fully convinced |
of ibe vanity of everything mortal, let us sub- >
mil to everything as the servants of Gi.d, who j
bas graciously promised to Is) no more upon
us than we can bear. Believe me ever your !
sincere friend and obedient servant." Very re
jpcctiully, Josiah A. Kellogg.
P. S. I have forgotten to speak to you about
getting one of Oscar's photographs to put in j
my album. lam getting as many ms I can of j
Dur battery boys and 1 have four of the Second I
Ohio Cavalry boys. If you have one (I mean j
. more tnan one) I would be greatly indebted to
' rou. Our summer campaign is at an end.
' We are in a beautiful camp at Decatur and in
tend to remain some five or six weeks (until
;no fall campaign commences), then will come
the tug of war.
Then follows a beautiful poetic quota-
Lion that stamps nearer than anything
rise the character of the writer. The
ferse is:

NAME OF A TOWN.
Emeryville and Golden Gate Cannot
Agree-
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 26. -The ques
tion of the incorporation of Emeryville
was before the Supervisors to-day , and
provoked a lively discussion. The terri
tory includes both Golden Gate and Em
eryville, and each district is anxious to re
serve its name. 'â â â â¢
A petition was presented setting forth
that much the larger of the territory
was known as Golden Gate at present;
that the population was about 2000 ; that
it was well known as a residence place,
consisting almost exclusively of property
owners, while Emeryville was principally
known from the, Judson Iron Works and
race track location. â " _. Â

Another petition was presented by J. C.

quest as that of Webb's. These were made
at the request oi the California Jockey

all parties and instructed the surveyor to
see ,if the boundaries were properly

RETURN WITHOUT GOLD
The Excelsior From Alaska
Brings Back the Last of the
Fortune-Hunters.
In Spite of the D.sappointments Many
Are Preparing to Go North Again
Next Sprang.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
9jÃ Broadway, Oct. 26. I
The schooner Excelsior docked at
Franklin-street wharf this morning, and
with her return closes the experience of
many of the young Oaklanders who went
north in the spring to take fortunes from
Alaskan gold mines. They have all come
back now, the last contingent arriving in
tne Excelsior, but their fortunes are still
in the Alaska soil.
Among those who have just returned
are Â£Tt Hempstead and Lewis Vesley,
an assayer. These men were employed by
the company that engineered many of the
ventures and that induced many people
to go north. They worked for the com
pany, and are now waiting for their pay,
which, they say, will be giver them in a
few days. Another one of the party is
"Fred," who was content to be Judse
Hetiftiaw's coachman till the gold craze
broke out. He also is no richer, except in
experience, than when he went away.
In spite of all the disappointments and
losses incurred by those who spent the
summer among the ice fields, there are
many who will go up next spring with no
better prospect than those who have just
returned.
"These schemes are all engineered by
ihe companies, who have things so
banned that ii a rich strike is made they
;et it all, and if nothing is iound. only the
men tney employ lose," said William
Moffitt to-day. "I saw enough up there to
show me how things are worked, and it is
i bunko game :rom beginning to end.
.There are several young fellows ready to
start again, and tsey cannot do anything
unless they have quite a sum of mouey to
start with* Everybody knows there is a
lot of gold up there, but it can only be ob
tained systematically and by an expensive
and elaborate process."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1896.
CANNOT MARRY
A WHITE BELLE
Musa of Zanzibar Disap
proves of the Laws of
This Nation.
Says He Is a Sporty Fellow and
Must Go Home for a
Wife.
RESULT OF HIS EDUCATION.
Admits That He Has Enjoyed His
Three Years' Experience of
American Life.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 26. )
In the course of a few months there will
very likely be a happy reunion and a
wedding in Zanzibar. The principals will
be Musa, a Zanzibar boy of Oakland, and a
young lady who is in Africa and whose
MUSA, the Lad Who Wants to Return to Zanzibar Because the
Law Forbids His Marriage to a California Belle.
name cannot be written in less than two
lines of American type.
Musa is Dr. Herrick r s coachman and has
been in Oakland for three years. Hecjime
here with that gentleman intending to
make America his future home, but he
has now learned enough to know that the
laws governing miscegenation will not
permit of his marrying a California belle,
so now he yearns for Afric's sunny strand
and the sweetheart of three years ago.
"I came here with Dr. Herrick," said
Musa to-day, "and at the same time Dr.
O. L. Jones brought another boy named
Juma. Trie papers tola all about Juma
and his Sunday-school, but they didn't
say anything about me. When I left I
said 1 wanted to come to America and
Dr. Herrick brought me. I did not know
how far America was and so 1 did not say
good-by to my mother and my sweet
heart, and now I feel sad.
"I want to go back and be married. I
had a little sweetheart in Zanzibar, and
now the policeman will not let me have
an American woman to marry, so I want
to go back. Dr. Herrick says I can go
after some time, and I am satisfied. He
has been very eood to me, but there is
not enough in OaKland for me. Some
times too cold, never too hot; nobody to
speak my language with except Juma,
and I have to wear too many clothes.
"I like good cloth s. because really I
am very sporty, and I should like Amer
ica very much if I cou.d get married ; but
I do not know how old I am, but I think I
am about 18. Dr. Herrick says I am 15,
but tie don't know when I was born â nor
do I, ah-ah-ah!"
Musa is a very bright boy, but he is
still very much an African. He was a
very ordinary street urchin in Zanzibar,
and when the two doctors who were
traveling proposed America to the lads
they jumped at the chance. They say they
have both been well treated, but are some
what anxious to go back to their homes.
Musa's ideas of beauty and expression
are very clearly shown'in the picture. He
went to a photographer and was told to
dress fiimself aud to Strike an attitude
that he thought would create the best im
pression on hi 3 sweetheart if one of his
ph otos should be sent to Africa. When
he returned with the proofs he was as
proud of the result as a corporal of militia
in a new uniform.
Drs. Jones and Herrick speak very well
of the boys and aav that the present ex
citement in Zanzibar has extended to the
boys and that the lads are infinitely bet
ter <ff than starving, unclothed in the
Â«treets*of Zanzibar.
VALUABLE LITERARY CURIO
Presented to the City by Wharfinger
Rutherford of Oakland.
A LAMBDA. Cal., Oct. 26.â City Libra
rian Harbourno has received a most inter
esting curio in the form of an old weather
worn copy of ''A Memoir of the Cultivation
of the Vine in America and the Best
Mode of Making Wine," written by John
Adlum and published in 1823. In the
front of the book is priuted the following
holographic letter from Thomas Jefferson :
Mosticello, April 11, 1823.
Dear Sir: I received successively the two bot
tles of wine you were so kind as to send me.
The first, called Tokay, is tru.y a fine wine, of
nigh flavor, and, as you assure me, there was
not a drop ol brandy or other spirit In it, I
may say it is a wine of a good body of its own.
The second bottle, a red wine, 1 tried when I
had good judges at the table. We agreed it
was a w: ne one might always drink with sat
isfaction, but of peculiar excellence. Of your
book on the culture of the vine it would be
presumption In me to give any opinion, be
cause It is a culture of which I have no knowl
edge, either from practice or reading. Wish
ing you very sincerely complete success in
tnis, your laudable undertaking, I assure you
of my great esteem and respect,
Thomas Jefferson.
Major John Adlum.
Fruit-growers will be interested in the
history of the industry from its infancy.
Came to an Agreement.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 26â The joint
committee representing this city and the
Board of Trade of Oakland in the harbor
controversy held a lengthy secret session
in the City Hall Saturday evening and
came to an agreement that was highly
satisfactory to ihe Oakland part of the
committee. Dr. McLean's favorite scheme
of urging the completion of the harbor
improvements along the lines laid down
on the first survey, with simultaneous
work on the harbor, canal and floodgates
in San Leandro Bay, was not recom
mended, but the exact nature of the re
port to be submitted could not be learned
to-night. The Oakland Board of Trade
will meet either to-morrow or Wednesday
to act upon the report before it is pre
sented to the City Council of that city.
Aiameda Trustees at Work.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 26.â The Board
of Trustees met to-night and authorized
the City Attorney and Engineer to pre
pare a resolution of intention to improve
Taylor place. A remonstrance, signed by
property-owners representing 781 J4 feet,
was presented and fi;ed. The worn was
requested by owners representing 146 feet.
This same fight was gone through with in
July of last year. Street Superintendent
Frodden's plan of employing ten men con
tinually on the streets instead of 240 men
one week each year, as heretofore, was
adopted. He claims that it will be a saving
of $2000 per year.

BENTLEY IS INDIGNANT
The Berkeley Pastor Denounces
the New Racetrack at
Emeryville.
A Thanksgiving Tl eater Partyâ Char
acter of "In Kokapo"â Late
News Notes
BERKELEY. Cal., Oct. 26.-Rev. Dr.
Robert Bentley, pastor of the Trinity
Methodist Church, denounced in no am
biguous terms the new racetrack at Emery
ville last n'ght. His sermon was en "Na
tional Prosperity," and in the course of
his remarks he drew a line betweeen mere
material prosperity and a truer prosperity
that rests upon reiigion and morality.
Gambling of stock boards was assailed in
strong language, and then the speaker
turned his attention to the racetrack. He
r. ferred to his recent triD to Europe, and
the many gambling institutions he took
note of there, which were conducted by
the various Governments.
"I felt thankful," said he, "that I lived
in v country where gambling was unlaw
! ful and where Sunday was respected.
Sinre my return from Europe I have had
reason to somewhat change my opinion.
Close to the border of our university town
a quarter of a million dollars has been
expended in fitting upa gigantic gamblinc
institution, and our Government has
grantei it a license. I look forward to
the time when members of our university
faculty will bo ready to stand forth and
use their power to prevent such pollution
of the atmosphere and surroundings of
our town as must necessarily be caused
by this nuge nest of gamDlers."
Thanksgiving Theater Party.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 28.â The uni
versiiy's thanksgiving theater party will

once a iemale agitator, has settled with a num
ber of companion rebels free from the yoke of
tyrant man. There are only three men on the
island who are the three l'riyy Councilors of
the Queen. In the course ot events dissatis
faction arises among the subjects because of
the dearth of tyrants. There o^cur rebellions,
when finally there is a shipwreck, which casts
upon the shores of the unhappy is laud a com
pany of amateur collegians.
The cast has not yet been made out, but
will be completed in a few days.

THREE FAVORITES
CAPTURED PURSES
The Outsider, Coda, Was the
Big Surprise of the
Day.
He Won, Practically Unbacked,
at the Long Odds of
30 to i.
UNA COLORADO WOIT EASILY.
Snider and Sea Spray Went Back in
the Bettingâ Lou Lon R Was
Beaten by Alma.
Just about the time people who are in
terested in horses and horseracing made
up their minds to take a trip across the
bay to Berkeley and see the second day's
card of the California Jockey Club run off
a shower of rain came down. The down
pour extended even across the bay, and
continued unceasingly throughout the
day. At Ingleside the mud, when it is
muddy, is of a brownish hue, but at the
Berkeley track it is blackâ blacker than
the shiny face of an Ethiopian monarch.
The rain was blown in on the grand stand,
rendering about half of it untenable. The
press stand, which is a redwood board
tacked on to the front railing of the stand,
was deserted, save by a lonely telegraph
operator, who could not leave his post.
When the fields were sent away tae first
two or three leaders could be distin
guished, but the others â all were black
hordes, ridden by black riders clothed in
black colors.
The regulars in attendance, who num
bered not a few, had all the best of the
day's betting. Three favorites and two
outsiders took purses, but, unfortunately
for the ring, the outsiders were freely
nibbled at.
Mid igbt. a muchly sought number in
the opening live-furlong dash for two
year-olds, well hacked at 9 to 10, passed
iier field in thy stretch and won easily
from Uannetta, the second choice, who
carried George Rise's colors.
ptiil Siebenthaler's Sea Spray opened a
3 to 1 iavonte for the six-lurlong spin that
followed, but when he changes riders, for
tune may change, too. Sea Spray went

Candor looked a winner at the arawgate,
wnere Una Colorado came stridinK along
on the outside and won with ease. Ricardo,
who ied to the head of the stretch, was
third behind Candor. Daisy A threw her
rider at the start.
One of those warm ones that recently
made the trip from the Eastern country
had a try in the next event, at six fur
longs, for the members of the two-year-old
contingent. It was Lou Lou R, a daughter
of Terra Cotta, carrying Sam Uildreth's
colors. Played down from 10 to 3, she
was outpaced from the jump by Alma.
who was the natural favorite, and beaten
out three parts of a length. Dura was
third.
Poor John Humphreys, the bookmaker,
looked di>ronsolate and forlorn as he
gazed on little Cnartreuse II having the
mud kicked in h<>r lace by nau_h.y,
haughty Mt. McGregor II in the seven
furlong selling affair that was called next.
The JNlcGrenor horse was favorite at 7 to

6 to 5.
The favorite with JÂ«nes up made a run-

been expected. The hall was comfortably
filled, however, when the meeting was
called to order. K. B. Smith, fusion ist
candidate for Governor of Montana, and
Judge Swinnerton of Stockton were the
speakers of the evening.
Mr. South spoke first, and said in part:
"I appear as the representative of silver,
but at the same* time I wish to state tuac
we do not discard gold. What we want
is merely that there shall be more money
of ultimate redemption for the people of
the United States. We do not believe in
the Drinciple of the contraction of
currency or the volume ot money of legal
tender quality. The volume of the cur
rancy in the country is a measure of the
value of property. With a decreasing
volume of money the value of the dollar
increases while the value of all other
property decreases. The converse of this
proposition is also maintained by all
writers, that with an increasing
volume of money the value of

the dollar decreases. The value of every
thing else compared with it increases.
There has been a general decrease in the
volume of money of ultimate redemption
in this country and as a result prices have
gradually risen. If the volume of money
was kept properly adjusted to the increase
of population and consequent increase of
business prices would rise. 1 '
In reply, Judge Swinnerton denied that
the Republican party was a party of gold
monometallism. He said that it was the
wonder of the world that this Nation had
maintained in ci 1 dilation on an equality
with gold such a quantity of silver. This
has been because of the policy of the Gov
ernment to make every dollar of whatever
nature as good as gold.
He claimed that the true standard in
determining prices is the purchasing
power of a day's labor and that this baa
steadily increased. The depression re
sulting in the tremendous loss to
labor and in diminished demand for
commodities had been owing to a fear of a
disturbance of the financial system
by the advocates of free silver,
but more especially to the tariff legislation
of the Democratic party. He made an ex
tended statement of the prosperity of the
country under protection,' and said with a
proper protection policy and a balance of
trade in our favor the financial question
would right itself.
Mr. Smith . occupied half an hour in
closing, and quoted Thomas Reed, saying
the silver question and tariff were one
and not two issues, and that values were
less fluctuating under a bimetallic than a
I single standard.

TOLD OF WOMEN
IN EASTERN LANDS
A Very Interesting Talk
by the Rev. Thomas
Marshal.
Presbyterian Union Wants All
Saloons Closed on Election
Day.
PROF. BUCK'S ELOQUENT PLEA.
The Methodists Make Arrangements
to Receive the New Church
Oificial.
The Occidental Board of Foreien Mis- i
Bions yesterday tendered n. reception in '
the parlors of the Mission House on Sac
ramento street, to Rev. Thomas Marshal,
D.D., field secretary of the Board of For
eign Missions.
Dr. Marshal's headquarters are in Chi
cago. To-morrow he leaves for Los An
geles.
The reverend gentleman met the repre
sentatives of fifteen of the City churches,
and after a brief conversation with each,
gave what he designated "a rambling \
talk" on "Women in Foreign Countries."
He is an entertaining speaker, gifted with
me power of graphically describing what j
he has seen, and his narration and dcliv- !
cry is such that, as a gentleman who heard
him said, "If there were more speakers
like him in the church there v.-ould be I
fewer 6leepers in the congregations."
He told of the women,of Japan, Korea,
China, Siam and India, and how the lack
of Christianity Drought them down to the
lowest depths of degradation. Then he
spoke of the revolution that Christianity
bad wrought &nd how it has uplifted
women in the social scale wherever it ha 3
bad an opportunity to make itself manifest.
The women of Japan, he said, "stand the j
highest, as a class, in the Asiatic countries '
and the evidence that their advancement
is dv? to Christian teaching is to be seen
in their homes and in the station they oc- (
cupy, irom a social point of view, in their i
E<len-like country.
The condition of the women in China
and the other countries, as Dr. Marshal '
observed it in a tour of many months,
showed that for lack of Christian teach
ing these women are the most degraded of
all creatures, but that where the women
of the missions had devoted their ener- '
gies to uplifting their sisters a marked ira- '
provement has resulted. He told of the '
schools and cnurches and of the work j
they arc engaged in and expressed the
bo^e that its field may be expanded.
The speaker was loudly applauded and
then congratulated upon his very instruc
tive talk.
Presbyterian Pastors.
Professor George D. Buck of the San
Anselmo Seminary read a paper before the ;
Presbyterian Ministerial Union yesterday j
on "Eloquence in the Pulpit." He praised j
the appropriate gestures used by actors, I
and said there was no reason why the j
same eloquence should not be used in the j
pulpit. Professor Buck advised his hear- j
ers to eschew tearful, trembling voices,
and to cultivate plastic muscles ana
natural emotional expression.
In the discussion a, number of interest- j
ing comments were passed on pulpit ora
tory. Rev. Dr. Burnett objected to hear- j
ing pastors soar on ministerial wings. He j
said it was not natural.
Dr. Minton criticized exaggerated ex
pression, and gave some amusing illustra- I
lions.
At the conclusion of the meeting the i
followine resolutions were adopted, and j
Rev. R. W. Reynolds, Rev. E. G. Mathena,
D.1)., and Key. James "Woodwonh were
appointed a committee to carry them into
elfect:
Resolved, That we request the Mayor and
Chief of i'oiice of tail City to strictly enforce
me law closing all saloons on election day.
Also, ihat we request the ttaiiy and weekly
papers to agitate tuis matter, that public sen ti- j
mem may be aroused, thus aiding our public
officials iii the discharge of their duty in the
case.
Methodist Union.
At the meeting of Methodist ministers
yesterday morning Rev. W. D. Chilson of |
the Potrero church read a paper on "The j
Faith Once Delivered to the feaints." He !
said that with all the questions of a prac
tical kind that engage the church the sub
ject of the faith never toses its interest.
After the meeting there was an informal
gathering of the committee on receiving
Bishop J. I. Newman. The committee
consists of: Â£.cv. S. J. Carroll, chairman;
C. B. Perkins, secretary; Rev. Dr. Alfred
Kummer, Rev. |Dr. Dille, Roll aV. Watt
and J. Maydwell. It was arranged that
Dr. Dille should deliver the address of wel
come.
John Willis Baer, secretary of the United
Society of Christian Endeavor, is ex
pected here two weeks from Saturday. He |
comes to concentrate efforts on behalf of
the convention of '97.
Rev. Dr. Coyle, presiding elder of the
San Francisco district, will hold the dis
trict quarterly meeting of the California
conference in Grace M. E. Church next j
month.
Congregational Club.
Rev. Dr. Scudder read a paper on "Mod
ern Missions" before the Congregational
Monday Ciub yesterday. "This," he said,
"is a term that stands for wide-world Con
gregationalism. It embodies the poetical j
expression ami the practical measure of
the church's laith."
The committee recently appointed by
the Congregational Board of Foreign Mis- \
sions for Pacific Coast work consists of
Rev. W. W. Scudder (chairman). Rev. C.
R. Brown and J. L. Barker of Berkeley.
Rev. Dr. Adams ot the First Congrega
tional Church is expected here on No
vember 7. The congregation has taken
the house 1733 Pine street for him.
THE NEW CHARTER
The Association Sends Letters to Fire
men and Teachers. ' â¢
The Citizens' Charter Association has
sent out two letters to the teachers in the
School Department ana to the members
of the Fire Department, explaining the
features of the charter baarinp ~ thereon. (
To the iiremenil.H.Hecht of the asso
ciation says that he has but two points to
make, which are summed up in these two
clauses of the proposed new charter: _/
At the beginning of the fiscal year next suc
reeding the adoption of the cnarter the Board
of : Fire . Commissioners " shall", reorganize the
Fire Department and lire alarm and police
telegraph of this City and County so as to con
form to the provisions of this charter, and in
so doing .~aid board shall appoint as such offi
cers, members and * employes'- those ; persons
now constituting the officers, members and
employs 01 the same. ' ',
No 3 officer,* ' member â or 'â¢ employe of . said de
partment or bureaus thereof shall be Appointed
or removed because of his political faith or
opinion, nor phall be be dismissed except for
cause; nor until alter . a fair trial as herein
after provided.
â¢ ; The address to , the . schoolteachers ;is
published in pamphlet form and >; consists
of twelve pages. -^lt' deals in detail with
Â»Ji the many questions and discussions
that have recently arisen relative to the
positions of teachers under the proposed

GUATEMALA'S FAIR.
California Will Send a Fine Exhibit
of Goods and ProductsâArrange
ments in Progress.
There will be a large meeting in the
Chamber of Commerce to-day, the object
of which wiil be to promote a California
exhihitof tiie best class at the Guatemala
exposition, which will beheld next year.
The Board of Trade has taken hold of the
matter in earnest, and will assist the
Chamber of Commerce as much as pos
sible. J. A. Filcher has been among the
merchants, and from all accounts they
will respond to the call liberally and as
sist in making a tine display.
The managers of the exposition at Gua
temala are backed by the Government, and
are liberal in their offers of diplomas and
cash premiums for exhibits of merit.
There will be ninety-two cash premiums,
varying from $100 to $5000. It has been
arranged that importations of such useful
articles as exhibited may be carried on for
one year free of duty, which is the first
time that such an offer has ever been
made by the Government.
Mr. Filcher has sent out letters to all of
the members of the Board of Trade, ask
ing them if they are in favor of assisting
in the exposition, and so far not a nega
tive answer has been received. In his let
ter Mr. Filcher says:
The Mechanics' Institute Fair recently held
in this City presented a stlendid exhibit of the
manufacturing industries of the State. If that
exhibit could be made at Guatemala it would
be highly creditable to California, and it is in
the line of wares in which Guatemalans
deal. There is more practical value in having
California strongly represented at Guatemala
than in any other fair now proposed, because
that country is now a part of the supporting
territory of the commerce of this City and the
people mere are extensive patrons of the man
ufactures of California. Under these circum
stances the Guatemalan Exposition affords
the opportunity for building up this common
wealth and stimulating this trade, and it ap
pears to be appropriate that the State Board
of Trade should take this up as a distinctive
San Francisco interest, because, as already
stated, the chief support of the board has been
derived ironi San lraucisco.
To this end it has been proposed that we ap
peal to the State Legislature aad to the Con
gress 01 the United States to make appropria
tions for the purpose of making an exhibit at
the International Exposition to be held nt
Guatemala. The National exhibit would
necessarily be general and represent the whole
Nation. We should emphasize the California
part of it by a small appropriation Irom tue
treasury of the State oi California.

Contest for a Child.
The Youths' Directory and the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children are en
gaged in a contest over the possession of Joe
Money, a 13-year-old boy.

phan Asylum at Kafacl. He ran away.
and subsequently was put in the Boys' Train

VOTERS SWINGING INTO LINE FOR McKINLEY
Assurance of Five Thou
sand Majority in South
ern Counties.
Predictions That the State Will
Be Carried by a Majority of
Fifteen Thousand.
EVERYWHERE ENTHUSIASM IS
INCREASING.
Leaders State That Major McKicley
Will Easily Carry Ca i
fornia.
The final swing of the campaign is
surely toward McKinley. At the head
quarters of the Republican State Central
Committee the last vestige of doubt con
cerning Republican victory has been dis
pelied. It is now a question of McKin
ley's majority, lesterday the committee
received the annexed message from
Southern California:
Los Akgei.es, Oct. 2(5, 1896.
Hnn. Frank McLaiujhlin, Chairman Republican
Stale central Committee: Our canvuss is solar
completed that 1 am justified in assuring you
that McKinley will have a majority of not less
than 5000 in counties south of Tehaehapl.
H. Z. Osborke.
Chairman Southern California Auxiliary Com
mittee.
John D. Spreckels, who has served on
the State Committee in tive campaigns, is
entirely contident that McKinley will
carry California by a handsome majority.
He was asked this question yesterday:
"Accepting Mr. Osborne's prediction as
correct, what do you say McKinley's ma
jority will be in the State?"
To this he responded:
"If McKinley carries the southern
counties by 5100 majority, as Osborne pre
dicts, he will carry the State by 8t least
15,000, and perhaps 20,000 majority."
J. A. Way mire is contident tsat McKin
ley will carry the City oi San Francisco by
a majority approximating 15,000.
Senator E. C. Voorheis came in from
Amador County yesterday. That county
went for Cleveland twice, and is usually
counted on for a Democratic majority of
at least 100. The Senator predicts that in
this election the county will be carried for
McKinley. The political enthusiasm in
the towns of that region is without prece
dent. The Bryanites had a rally at Sutter
Creek Thursday night last when Maguire
was there, and boasted for two days that
such a demonstration could not be
equaled. Saturday evening the Republi
cans gathered from the surrounding coun
try to hear Samuel M. Shortridge. The
voters began to arrive in the aiternoon
and their ranks kept increasing and in
creasing until the Bryanites threw up
their hands and acknowledged that their
big turnout of Thursday night was far
surpassed, both in point of numbers as
sembled, voters in line and" enthusiasm
displayed. Mr. Shortridge never spoke to
better advantage. He was gratified be
yond measure by the magnitude of the
demonstration and the enthusiasm which
his address awakened.
At Jackson, Amador County, next Satur
day night the Republicans will hold
another great meeting. The Republican
enthusiasm aroused in Amador County is
displayed ail alone the line of mountain
counties. Where the Bryanites hoped to
get large majorities for their candidates,
the Republicans are taking the lead, and
swinging all the wavering voters into the
McKinley column.
The campaign managers of the Repub
lican party are not relaxing effort or vigi
lance on account of the assurances of vic
tory. Exertion is doubled to render the
victory complete and overwhelming.
There should be a large turnout this
evening to hear General N. P. Chipman
and Joseph C. Campbell at the Audito
rium. Aside from the eloquent and spir
ited speeches there will be music, singing
and recitations.
To-morrow night at the Auditorium
Hon. F. X. Schoonmaker, the eloquent
orator from New Jersey, will address the
people. He has just returned from a bril
liant tour of the State. He addressed
great audiences at Nevada City, Sacra
mento, Stockton, Oakland, San Jose, Batc
erstield, Tulare, Modesto, Napa, Marys
ville, Red Bluff, Yreka, Redding and Wil
lows.
M. R. HiggiHs of the Republican State
Central Committee asserts that there
must be something singularly fascinating
and persuasive in .Mr. Schoonmaker's
style, for the committee has been besieged
with requests that he shall return and
speak in the places where he has already
Bpoken. There is something in his
method and manner which captivates the
audience. He will doubtless have a rous
ing meeting. At the Auditorium to-mor
row nieht ex-United States Senator
Charles N. Felton will preside.
STRONG FOR McKINLEY.
District Attorney Barnes Visited in
Southern California by Ex-
Confederate Veterans.
District Attorney William S. Barnes, at
the request of tLe Republican State Cen
tral Committee, has just been engaged in
a canvass of the southern part of the State.
During his trip he delivered Beveral ad
dresses and was uniformly greeted with
Jaree crowds and a warm reception, re
ceiving in many places ovations significant
of the lact that Southern California's vote
is safe for McKinley and prosperity. Mr.
Barnes returned home yesterday.
'â¢The region I have canvassed," he said,
"extends from Tehachapi to the Mexican
line. I find that in that great district
wherever there is water, alluvial soil and
growing crops the people, irrespective of
party affiliations, are for McKinley.
"The great industries of that section of
the country are the citrus fruit, tne wal
nut and the beet sugar industries. It
costs the Southern Californian grower
$1 50 a box to lay down a box of oranges
in New I'ork. It co9ts the Mediterranean

grower about 50 cents to lay down the
same sized box of oranges there.
"Irrespective of party the citrus fruit
grower is for McKinley. The beet-suear
industry is the second staple industry of
Southern California. There is now a beet
sugar factory at Chino, and the people
hope soon to establish factories at Ana
heim and New Westminster.
"Bryan has declared against sugar
beets. McKinley has declared in favor of
them. Therefore the people who are in
terested in the sugar beet and citrus fruit
industries are sure to cast party bonds
aside and vote for McKinley.
"It has been said that Southern Cali
fornia is the home of Populism and the
silver sentiment. Generally this is not
the fact; locally it is true. The less de
sirable immigration of that section, con
sisting of the Kansan, the Missourian and
the ambulatory agriculturist of the South
west, has passed by the alluvial lands and
seemed tosettle upon the less productive
farms of thai &ection. These people, who
have settled upon lands unirrigated, with
difficult communication and with im
perfect crops, have seized upon the
propaganda of the Populist party, which
denounces the doctrines under which the
Republic has grown from a mewling in
fant fnio a stalwart giant. They do not
realize that the difficulty lies in them
selves and not in the government of the
country.
"Take a map of Southern Califor
nia. Wherever you find desert land, lack
of water, difficulty of communication, ex
ploded 'boom towns,' and small villages
with large names â there you will find the
Populist in ail his glory.
"Where you find alluvial soil, a well
watered country, an intelligent popula
tion that starts banks, builds school
houses and churches and opens factories,
there you will find the vote for McKinley.
"I believe that the great productive dis
trict of Southern California will come up
to the Tehachapi with such an overwhelm
ing vote for the representative of sound
money and a tariff for protection that it
will overcome any Populist vote that may
De registered by the desert class.
"In Southern California the Democratic
party is dead â tue Populist party has ab
sorbed it. All Democrats are in favor of
tne Republican ticket; only the Populists
are against it. The result is not fusion of
the Democrats and Populists as against
the Republican, bui fusion between tlie
Democrats and Repulicans against the
Populist propaganda.
"I believe that the McKinley electors
will carry Southern California by an over
whelming plurality.
"I spoke in San Diego to at least 6000
people, at Phcenix Park to 700 or 800, at
Santa Ana to about 3000, at Redlands to
about 2000, and at Ontario to fully 1500
persons. There seemed to be a uniform
enthusiasm for the Republican ticket.
"Among other pleasant experiences
which I enjoyed was the call I received
from representative ex-Confederate veter
ans who had fought in the war of the Re
bellion. They informed me that the
ex-Confederates are now among the most
loyal citizens of the Republic; that they
had fought out the doctrines of State
rights, and intend to vote for McKinley
because they are opposed to the platform
of the Democratic party, which denounces
Federal interference and seeks to revive
the doctrine of State rights."
BEAR CLUB.
This Effective Organization Will Be
a Feature of the Parade.
A very large and enthusiastic meeting
of the. Bear Club was held last evening at
B. B. Hall, Eddy street, Vice-President
I. P. Kincaid in the chair, and N. E.
Maison secretary.
Thirty-five new members were admitted
to the club, bringing its number up to the
largest campaign club in the City, in
addition to which there is a very fine drill
corps of seventy-five members.
The club decided to turn out in full
force, headed by the band and drill corps,
in the parade on Saturday afternoon;
also to attend ether parades during the
week, and on next Monday evening cross
the bay and take part in the closing de
monstration in Oakland.
Several short but effective addresses
were made by the members, including a
fine report of Republican prospects in the
southern part of the State by C. W. Kyle,
who has just returned from a campaign
ing tour in those quarters.
Other speakers were: Judge John Hunt,
H. C. Dibble, H. L. Joachimsen, A. B.
Treadwell, Henry S. Martin, F. L. Turrrin,
Charles E. Fredericks. C. L. Taylor, E. I.
Wolfe and Dr. Soper.
On adjournment of the meeting the
members were invited into the basement
of the hall to witness the evolutions of
drill corps, and were much pleased with
this adjunct of their association.
A VETERAN CAMPFIRE.

and refreshments generally.
It is expected to be one of the most en
thusiastic meetings of the campaign.
Tables will be set to accommodate at least
500 comrades, who will be admitted free
to the lower hall on exhibiting their
badges, the galleries being reserved for
ladies and their escorts.

CASHBOOKS MISSING.
Records of Commander of Naval Bat
talion I nder Investigation.
The cashbooks of the First Division of
the Naval Battalion are missing. The offi
cer who had them in charge has resigned
and is now in Santa Cruz on personal
business, while a special committee is
making investigations.
.for some time the committee appointed
by Major-General James ana consisting of
Major Charles L. Tilden of the First In
fantry, Captain D. A. Smith fof the Fifth
Infantry and Lieutenant J. G. Underbill,
ordnance officer of the Naval Battalion]
has been making inquiries into this'
matter and others, but has not yet
completed its labors.
The facts of the case, it seems, are
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1896.
these: Lieutenant C. A. Douglass was
commander of the First Division of the
Naval Battalion from it 3 inception three
years ago. According to a State law he
received $1200 a year and an additional
$150, the total sum to be used in equip
ping the division. The cashbooks were
not in evidence, though from time to
time reports went as required to Sacra
mento to show the disbursements.
.Lieutenant-Commander Turner aid not
get the explanation he wanted regarding
rumors of mismanagement and sent in his
resignation to General James. Lieuten
ant Douglass also sent in a resignation.
His was granted, the others shelved.
Then the investigation began. Douglass'
friends confidently assert that he will, as
soon as he has completed his business, re
turn here and make satisfactory explana
tions to the investigating committee.
Fell Into the Bay.
Con Lynch, the watchman at Mission-street
wharf 2. saved a man from drowning last
evening-. Early in the evening he saw J.
Donnelly, a sailor on the ship Oriental, go on
board the vessel, and the watchman thought
that the sailor had been drinking. A little
later Donnelly left the ship ami started to go
up the wharf. He staggered over the stringer
and fell into the bay. Lynch was quickly on
hand with a rope, that he keeps for such y>ur
peses, and threw a bowline over the sailor's
head and shoulders. With the help of a fire
man Lynch got the half-drowned man to the
wharf. This makes the fifth man that the
watchman has rescued with the same rope
this year.
United Lnbor Meeting
The United Labor party held a meeting last
night in Wessells' Hall. Joseph Kelly, an old
and well-known trades unionist, spoke at con
siderable length and with much force upon
the principle of protection, expressing his
surprise how organized labor could, in the
face of its own proiesslons, which were essen*
tially protective, advocate free trade. Cap
tain Blcnnerhassett also spoke tn a most forci
ble manner upon the same subject.
T. B. O'Brien was stronely urged as the next
Congressman. Henry S. Martin, candidate for
Treasurer, was also highly commended. The
meeting, notwithstanding the weather, was a
success in every particular.
NEW THEATER TO OPEN,
The Old Bush-Street Will Be
Refitted at Once and
Renamed.
Different Eastern Companies to Be
Played Every Ten Weeks.
Incorporated Here.
The Lyceum Theater Company of Cali
fornia was yesterday incorporated by
A. S. Lowndes, D. L. Conkling and Ten
ison Dean. The capital stock is $10,000,
all of which is subscribed.
The object of the new corporation is to
open in this City a theater of its own,
where legitimate and romantic dramas
will be produced.
It has already decided to occupy the
Bush-street Theater, which 'will b9 thor
oughly renovated and refitted. A new
name will also be given to it. Work ttpo n
the building will commence immediately
and will be pushed with vigor, as the
initial performance will be given about
December].. Thereafter the intention is
to maintain a continuous series of per
formances during a long season.
The best obtainable Eastern companies
will be encaged, and every ten weeks an
entire new cast will be imported. In a
general way the plan is to follow a course
similar to that of the Columbia Theater
with its Frawley and other companies.
At first the promoters thought of hav
ing an entirely new theater built, but the
plan was not considered feasible. Then it
became a matter of choosing the unused
theater in the St. Nicholas Hotel building
or the old one on Bush street. The ad
vantage of a downtown location easily
persuaded them, and the Bush - street
Theater was Jeased.
The Five - Legged Pet of Coima*
The success of theater business here
compared with other cities during the last
two seasons has done much to prompt the
new enterprise. And the willingness now
of Eastern companies to come out here
has undoubtedly had its effect also.

Miss Jenny Lind Shelley sang two songs with

Illegal Fishing-Gear.
Deputies Wilson and Davis made a run up
the river in the Fish Commissioners' launch
Hustler last week, in quest of illegal fishers
and fishing-tcckie. Around Sherman Island
and Elk Slough tne deputies confiscated over
2400 feet of illegal sturjreon-llne and six an
chors, worth over $180. It was a hard blow to
the fishermen, who expected to realize good
returns on their set Hues, although they well
know that the business is in violation of the
law.
THIS BEATS THE
CALAVERAS FROG
A Batrachian With Five
Legs and a Gift of
Prophecy.
He Hops on a Bias and Croaks
Down All Wild Bryanic
Fallacies.
SAYS M'ZINLEY WILL WIN.
Strange Freak of Dame Nature as
Expressed in a Salcon Man's
Unique Pet
A frog with five distinct, well- formed
and useful legs is at present the pride of
Colma. Bright, frisky, tame and very
prettily marked in all the tints and shades
most nleasing to the epicure, this remark
able little creature is at once a pet and a
curiosity.
He was born and has always lived some
where near the town. They know that
for they have studied his style of travel
ing. With three legs on the left side and
only two on the other his course con
tinually veers to the right, so that after
making a number of jump 3he arrives at
his starting point.
When first discovered by James
O'Connor, about three weeks ago, he was
industriously describing circles near Holy
Cross Cemetery. After finishing a round
at furious speed the frog began laboriously
to drag himself toward a pond close by,
usinc only his two front feet, but going
straight ahead. It was then O'Connor,
stepping closer to learn if it was injured,
saw the extra leg and at once captured
the interesting reptile for his friend
Harry Casey, who holds forth at a corner
where at this season men are wont to con
gregate to discuss politics and mild bever
ages.
The fact that this strange frog has five
legs is not the only unusual thing about
him. He has nineteen toes, three on each
hind feet, four on each of two other feet
I and five on the foot belonging to the extra
I leg, which joins his body forward of the
normal front leg and is supplied with
regular bones and joints. The connection
with the body is acparently normal. In
all other respects the frog is like any
other in appearance and in health.
"That frog is as smart as the politi
cians," remarked one of bis admirers yes^
I terday. "He has a big brain and saveys
the business. The other day I was in tho
room. I put him on the floor and asked :
'Who will be the next President, Bryan
or McKinley?'
"He made a big jump, then a little one,
then six long ones. I wondered what he
meant, and asked him, 'What is that,
Bryan?'
"He shook his head. Then he jumped
again; one long leap, one short one and
. six as far as ho could reach.
"Is that McKinley, I asked, and in reply
he moved his head up and down.
"I knew his mother for two years. She
Jived down by the railroad track. One
time her left front loot was cut off by a
train. After that she hated the railroad
company worse than does Mayor Sutro.
She jumps at the trains whenever they
pass by, and some time she will be run
over and killed. This young one is just
like his dam, but he has more sense, and
he's got one more leg, too.
"The other day I was in the room alone
with him and put him on the floor and
said, 'Who will be the next Mayor?'
He jumped six times, and I asked, 'Who
is that, Taylor or Phelan? The frog
winked his eve. I suppose he was stuck
that time.
"No one seems to believe me when I say
that the reptile knows more about politics
than most men, but when they bring him
out and I asK him, 'What's the matter
with Bryan?' they are all convinced. He
just swells himself up and croaks and
croaks and croaks."
TALKS OF FILIBUSTERING
S. Cash Makes an Appeal for
Cuba to Methodist
Preachers.
Volunteers Who Go Under Auspices
of His Party Must Pay Their
Own Expenses.
At the conclusion of the Methodist
preachers' meeting yesterday two exotic
looking gentlemen were informally intro
duced and it was stated that they wished
to enter a plea for aid for the suffering in
surgents in Cuba. It was too late for the
visitors to be allowed the privilege of the
floor, but they will be heard next week,
and in the meantime they improved the
shining hour yesterday by circulating
round among the various ministers after
the meeting and laying their cause before
them.
Samuel Cash, the spokesman of the two
visitors, is a tall dark man, with a fierce
mustache, whose general appearance is not
unlike a schoolboy's ideal of one of Cap
tain Maync iieid's heroes. He was ar
rayed in black, with a huge sombrero hat,
and he wore a cable of gold round his
neck thick enough to hold a small anchor.
He also wore a gilt nugget inÂ»placeof a
breastpin. Altogether his appearance was
strikingly florid and picturesque. Mr.
Cash's companion, who gave the name of
J. H. Green, said he was an American
who was devoting his efforts to helping
the cause of Cuba.
"I am of United States origin," said
Mr. Cash, when > interviewed after the
meeting, "but I went to Cuba when quite
a child, and consider myself almost a
Cuban. Two of my brothers are fighting
in the Cuban army, and my sister is nurs
ing the Cuban wounded. I have been
touring the United States soliciting
money, food and cast-off clothing for tne
unfortunate rebels. We should be glad
of anything, even an old hat or a pair of
overalls."
There was not the slightest trace of
Spanish accent in Samuel Cash's words,
but this he attributed to having come of
American parentage. When a~ked if ha
represented any religious denomination
in Cuba, he replied that he was working
in the cause of humanity and patriotism
only, and could give no references to any
one, either in this country or Cuba.
"I wish you to understand that lam
not a filibuster, but I am in league and
sympathy w.ith those who are," he said.
"The filibusters have to be very careful to
escape the law, and therefore I cannot
state who are my colleagues. We have
headquarters in New York, and we have
also an organization here. There are be
tween thirty-five and forty Cuban patriots
In this City, but if I told their names the
Spanish spies, who are always on our trai),
would manage to secure their conviction
for filibustering; therefore I act for them.
â¢If any one wishes to join the Cuban army
let him apply to me, Samuel Cash, 624
California street. I will not enroll him us
a volunteer, but I will direct him to those
who will."
In proof of this statement Mr. Cash
brought a printed document from a case
Fac-Sfmile of the Letter Received by Postmaster McCoppin*
which be carried in his hand. It looked
like an enrollment paper, and contained a
number of signatures, which he would
not permst to be perused. Turning to one
of the biank pages, be showed a portion
of a heading, which began: "By author
ity of the Cuban Junta. Article of agree
ment, the insurgents of the Island of
Cuba parties of the first part, and the vol
unteer citizens of America, who may see
lit Jo lend their support in behalf of
the suffering Americans now being tor
tured and punished by the Spanish au
thorities in the Island of Cuba, be pro
tected with all the zeal and energy in
their power; furthermore, we, the under
signed, hereby airree to pay the sums of
money set opposite our respective names."
The a Dove portion, with regard to sub
scriptions, was rather incoherent as well
as ungrammatical, but the paragraph with
regard to personal service was more plain :
"Article of agreement for Americans who
may voluntarily lend their support to join
the Cubans in behalf of the suffering in
surgents, for the purpose of aiding them
in their heroic endeavors in attempting to
free the island of Cuba from the dominion
of the Spanish Government." The article
further stated that men who were to give
their services must pay their own expenses
in traveling to the island of Cuba.
"Twenty-one Californians left for Cuba
last Tuesday," said Mr. Cash. "Men who
had been recruited in different parts of
the State. The thing was managed so
quietly that nothing was heard of their
going. At present they are in one of the
Southern ports waiting for an opportunity
to cet across."
Samuel Cash's avocation was not stated
at the meeting yesterday, but he is en
gaged in running a shooting gallery on
Kearny street, near California.

WANTS TO BLOW

The Postmaster Receives a
Queer Threatening
Letter.
How James Taylor Caused Con
sternation in the Ranks of
Postal Employes.
BELIEVED TO BE A CRANK.
All Efforts, However, lo Arrest the
Writer of the Letter Have so
Far Failed.
Inspector-in-Charge Munro is vainly
seeking one James Taylor, who, through
malice or an insane freak, has succeeded
in making the lives of postal employes
not worth living. Secretary Richardson
is rapidly nearing nervous prostration,
and there are others who threaten to col-
1 lapse physically unless something is
done to relieve the tension.
The whole trouble is due to a very
bloodthirsty letter written by the above
noted Taylor. Sunday morning Postmas
ter McCoppin received the following:
Postmaster â Postmaster of San Francisco:
I see you are holding Males from me, and if I
don't get a Letter by Monday I will wipe out
the whole postoffice and blow the whole thing
to D if I don't! Will take me for a
fool any longt-r, bo I will give you but' a
sho rt time to give me my letter.
James Tayloe,
Empire House, Clay Street
Answer quickly.
At first little or no attention was paid
the threatening letter, but when Inspector
Munro investigated the case and found
that Taylor existed in the flesh and was
counted'a "bad man" by those who knew
him, an intense nervousness seized every
one. When a mail-sack dropped there
was a wild stampede for the door, and
once when a pretty girl licked a stamp out
in the big corridor'there was a spontaneous
contraction of heart strings.
But after ail nothing happened. Later
in the day Inspector Munro caused a note
to be left at the Empire House, requesting
Taylor to call at once. About 3 o'clock
Taylor left the note at Station D, with the
request that it be handed the Inspector.
On the back of the note he had repeated
the warning given Postmaster McCoppin.
though his vengeance was postponed until
to-day.
There are those who think that Taylor
has become frenzied over some fancied
wrong and is quite capable of doing ali
that he says, while others believe him to
be a harmless crank who thinks it smart
to frighten people. In the meantime
every effort is being made to locate the
self-announced anarchist, and as a pre
cautionary measure an extra policeman
will be on duty at the Postoffice to-day.
