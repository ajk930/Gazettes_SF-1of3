A WINGED SHIP IN THE SKI,
It Cleaves the Air With
Pinions Like a Huge
Condor.
ALL SACRAMENTO SEES
THE NEW WONDER.
The Inventor's Lawyer Describes
the Machine and Says It
Is Genuine.
IT WAS SEEN SOARING NEAR SAN
JOSE AT MIDNIGHT.
'The Call's" Exclusive Account of the Greatest
Invention of .the Age Is Now Corrobo
rated by Thousands.
For several days there have been per
sistent reports that a huge airship has
been seen in the vicinity of Oakland. Sac
ramento and San Francisco. The Call
has contained daily and exclusive ac
counts of the appearance, and now there
is an avalanche of testimony to tbe effect
that many persons of truthful reputations
have seen something like a huge seraph
in the air, spreading its electric pinions
.and so-.ring faster than a giant condor of
tbe Andes. 60 numerous have been the
reports thai the possibility of aerial navi
gation is now tbe absorbing theme of the
day.
There is now a vast amount of corrobo
rative testimony to the effect that there is
a practical airship afloat in tne azure
-paces hereabouts, and the meaning of
this testimony has been made clear by the
positive statement of Attorney George D
Collins of Alameda that he has a wealthy
client wbo is tbe inventor of the great
aerial ship, and that it will soon be known
to the entire world.
The ship was seen in Sacramento last
night, and the evidence is increasing that
the same great propeller recently passed
through the- heavens over Oakland and
San Francisco.
The positive testimony of Collins that the
airÂ«hip is a reality has now been signally
corroborated by the testimony of thou
sands of citizens of Sacramento who saw
the great ship in the air last night. The
following accounts from Oakland and Sac
ramento make the matter as clear as ordi
nary human testim ny could do.
One of the most in teresting of the corrob
orative stories comes" from Thomas Jor
dan of San Rafael, who states that he
found a machine-3hoo in a mountain
fastness some month? ago: that six men
were working on an airship and that it
would soon be completed.
In tbe first day's story of the airship,
as printed in The Call, it was stated that
an old hunter named Brown of Bolinas
Ridge had seen an airship floating a few
hundred feet above the pine trees one
morning just as the fogs were lifting from
tbe ridge.

Ship.
OAKLAND, Cal., Not. 22.â Attorney
Collins was the busiest man in Alameda
County to-day. During the first part of
the day all his efforts were directed to
keeping away from the carious throng
that wished to talk to him aud interview
him and try to induce bim to describe and
draw pictures of the Oroville millionaire's
airship.' Not until late in the evening
could he be induced to po into the parlor
of hie home on Union otreet, Aiarnoda,
and tell what he knew of the invention
that has startled not only this State, but
the entire country.
"A few weeKs ago," said Mr. Collins, "I
came lrom Washington, whither I had
â¢ been on important business. On my ar
rival in this State I met a gentleman who
introduced himself to me, and woen I told
him where 1 had been he immediately
aaid he was very sorry that he had not
met me prior to my departure, as he bad
some important business to transact at
the Patent Office in Washington which he
would not trust in the mail or by any
other means than a trusted servant.
"I asked him what bis business con-
sisted of, but beyond telling me that he
was an inventor, I got no further details
from him at that time. He told me enough
in an indirect manner to convince me that
he was a man who had a secret that he
evidently cherished dearly, but be en
lightened me no further, and beyond
exchanging cards, our acquaintanceship
developed nothing more tiil later. A few
days afterward he called on me at my
office in San Francisco, but as he did not
talk about business, lconcluded that he had
merely paid me a social call. I became
greatly interested in that inventon. I
The San Francisco Call
could not help noticing that there was a
desire on his part to tell me more than I
knew, and I could also sec that he re
strained himself irom doing so. He called
on me a second time, chatted about a few
immaterial matters and departed, leaving
me in wonder as to when he would con file
anything further to me. Altogether, he
made about half a dozen of these visits,
and I concluded that he really did intend
to talk business every time lie came, but
that his courage failed him aa soon as he
got in the office.
"Finally he got up courage enongh to
tell me tie was not only an inventor but
that c reaily had an invention. He
asked me if he could place confidence in
me. I replied, 'Do you mean as a friend
or as an attorney?' He said, 'As both.'
I told him that I could not recall any oc
casion in which I had violated a friend's
or a client's confidence and that I thought
I was fully capable of attending to any
business he might wish me to transact for
him. He said that if his secret were made
public prematurely it would mean the
loss to him of an immense fortune. He
further assured me thai it waÂ« an inven
tion that anybody would willingly steal if
they had the opportunity. I talked to
him for a little while and succeeded in
assuring him that if such were the case I,
as an attorney, would be just as anxious
to protect his interests as he would be
himself.
"I am telling you the details of my first
meeting with this inventor because they
carry with them a good idea of the nature
of the man and also are evidence of his
sincerity and belief in the practicability
of his invention.
"He is a resident of Oroville and a man
of wealth, about 47 years of age, and a fine
looking fellow. He does not talk for five
minutes without convincing his hearer
that he is a man of more than ordinary
intelligence. The first time he talked to
me of his invention he got as far as tbe
word airship; then I laughed, and laugned
heartily.
"What kind of whisky have you been
drinking?" I asked him.
This made him indignant, and had I
laughed any longer be certainly would
have got very angry and I should have
most probably have lost a client.
"'I have not been drinking, sir,' he
said, 'and when 1 do it is not whisky.'
"Even that answer did not assure me,
and I again said, 'Have any members of
your family ever been in the lunatic asy
lum?'
"He did not appreciate this any more
than my other remark, and drawing him
self to his full height and stamping one
foot on the floor, he replied, 'No, : sir, I
am a man of business. I have come here
on a business errand, and had I not met
you previously and been convinced that
I could trust you I think our acquaintance
would end right here. However, I can ex
cuse yonr surprise, for everybody believes
that ah inventor must naturally be crazy
until he has proved that his invention is
practicable. Then, I suppose, people call
him a genius. I have got over the crazy
stage, but I do not yet claim to be a
genius; but 1 certainly am practical.

the East in such manner as not to excite
curiosity.
"Of course I am informed regarding
nearly all tie details, but I am not at lib
erty to talk about them. As near as I c.in
recollect the propelling power is produced
by compressed air, which works the arms
and also produces the light. There is in
the airship a little motor of sufficient
power to produce the brilliant light that
everyb >dy has seen. As soon as he told
me this 1 hinted that it would be a good
thing to make the matter public, but he
refused, saying that publicity at that time
wouid call attention to his work, would

and mignt prove the ruin of his enter
prise. Now he is not so particular. He
has informed me that It Is sufficiently ad
vanced for nim to patent, and tliat he can
take out successive patents for any other
contrivance he may invent in order to
I make his machine perfect.
''The next time we .met was quite re-
I cently and after the machine had been
I seen in various parts of the State. He told
I me that tho>>e fellows were right who
i talked to Tee Call reporter at Sacra
mento and were telling the truth. On the
Q&ht that it was been there he lle t Oro
ville in tbe afternoon, made a straight
trip to Sacramento, which is about sixty
miles, took a few turns over the Capitol,
wont off about fifty miles and descended.
On that occasion he made sixty miles in
forty-five m nutes, but I understand that
there is practically no limit to the speed
which can be atiained, provided the neces
sary machinery is made. I mean by this
that the principle of the airship would
almost admit of lightning si>ee<i, but that
conditions that have to be met of course
limit its power of resistance.
"1 believe, however that in a very short
time it will be able to make three miles in
two minutes, and the inventor tells me
that more is possible.
"The machine did pass over Oakland
last Fnday night. The inventor crime
from Oroville and descended near Hay- j
wards. Ido not know where the machine
is now, but 1 think all das yesterday it re

is making trips every ni^ht and has been

venting, and apparently from what is re
ported he has made tbe necessary adjust
ment to insure smooth flying.
"From every quarier I have received re
ports during the past few days of this
machine, and although there are many
who may still be skeptical regarding what
is claimed for it, I thoroughly believe that
it is now perfect."
R. B. Mitchell of the firm of Pierson &
Mitchell, San Francisco, called oh Mr.
Collins this evening to discuss the merits
of the new invention. Mr. Mitchell had
the idea when he called that Mr. Collins
had the inventor hidden in his house for
the purpose of keeping him from the pub
lic. Mr. Collins, how ver, denied this and
said that he could not really give any in
formation of the inventor's whereabouts.
"I have no doubt," said Mr. Collins,
"that if the night is at all pleasant the in
ventor is in his machine about half a
mile over the earth startling some of the
inhabitants of tiiis State. To-morrow
morning's papers . may possibly inform
you where ha was at this time. 1 believe
he has gone home, aud if he has he cer
tainly flew there."
Then Mr. Mitchell became very definite.

POINT ARENA, Cal., Nov. 22.â The
Pacific Improvement Company's steel
screw steamship San Benito was driven
ashore two miles north of the Point Arena
light by a gale at 1 o'clock this morning.
Eight of the crew were lost, eleven reached
the shore and the rest, twent-four in num
ber, are clingine to the rigging, swept
each minute by the charging surf. The
names of the Known dead are:
0. W. SCOTT, fiMt assistant engineer.
C. CONDON, second assistant engineer.
M. PENDERGAST, firemau.
M. SHERIDAN, measboy.
The steamer struck on tbe sand beach
and after breaking in two the stern swung
around and now lies about 500 feet from
the beach, stern in shore. The forward
part, on which the crew clings, lies broad
side to the sea about 100 feet north of the
afterpart of the ship and a little farther
out.
Part of the men are in tbe rigging
of the foremast and some are on the
wheelhou^e. The poor fellows in the
rigging can be seen moving up and down
in their efforts to keep warm, for they are

wind blowing on them would chili any
one not a seaman in a very short time.
The latest reports from the wreck are that
the men are still hanging on and eagerly
watching for the expected tug which fiey
think will surely be sent by the owners of
the vessel. The people on chore have
built great fires from wood gathered on
the beach, so a bright light is cast onlo
the wreck.
The San Benito, Captain Smith, left
Tacoma on Wednesday afternoon with a
cargo of 4000 tons of coal for Ban Fran
cisco. It encountered head winds all the
way down and the crew did not see land
until Saturday. Then a heavy rain felL
They could not see any distance from the
ship, but from the log believed they had

At 1 o'clock this morning the steamship
struck suddenly north of Point Arena light
house and immediately blew ita whistle
for assistance. The surf was very high,
seas breaking over the ship, which almost
instantly broke in tbe middle, just back
of the smokestack. The crew, in charge
of First Assistant Engineer Scott,
launched a boat containing nine men, but
it was swampea immediately and onlji
four reached the shore, nearly exhausted.
Three of the survivors started inland

and came to the house of O. W. Davis,
who aroused the neighbors and hastened
to the scene of the wreck after sending a
mau to the town of Point Arena, seven
miles distant, for help.
George Christopher, a fireman, jumped
overboard immediately after the ship
struck, and after a hard struggle reached
shore and started for the lighthouse,
whose light he could see as the storm had
suddenly ceased. He had been told a
life-saving crew was stationed there, but
when he came to Garcia River, which was
Fwolleh by rain, he could not pass. He
went to the ranch of Thomas Kenney,
who at once hitched up a team and started
for town, with Christopher and another
survivor, Narciso Layva, who had also
reached the house. Everybody in Point
Areua was aroused, and soon, after day
light the beach was covered with men
anxious to help.
The boat that was swamped came ashore
in good condition and the men on the
beach tried to reach the stranded steamer
in it, but failed. Meanw ile the steamer
Point Arena came into port at Point Arena
and landed its pasdeugers, and then
steamed to the wreck to render assistance.
A boat was put off from her and after two
hours' hard work and many narrow es
capes, it succeeded in getting Chief Engi
nsar Wood and five others off the rigging
and putting them aboard the Point Arena.
They tried a number of times to reach the
wreck again, but failed.
About 10 o'clock one of the sailors was
washed from the rigging into the sea, and
after a hard battle of twenty minutes the
men from shore waded in and pulled him
ashore, more dead than alive. Dr. Galli
son, from Point Arena, was on hand and
took charge of him. The water along the
beach is very muddy from the current out
of Garcia River and Brush Creek, which
makes it dillicult to keep afloat.
At 2 o'clock the steamer Weeett came up
and after trying to assist found she could
do nothing, so steamed back to the port at
Point Arena and landed her gun for
throwing life-line?, wrrieh was started
overland at once to the scene of the disas
ter. The watcher on shore tried to send a
line over the wreck by shooting from shot
guns and rifles, but without success.
A bout 4 p. m. a very large wave washed
over the wreck, aud it is believed that
three men were washed overboard. One
was pulled back onto the wreck, but the
other sank.
Ths scene was heartrending. Men,
women and children remained on the
beach since daylight without eating.
Kind-hearted farmers brought provisions
and milk for all, though none cared to
touch a morsel. Men were shouting,
women wrin ing their hands and crying,
every one trying to do or suggest some
thing, but all of no avail.
The men who have been rescued can
give no definite cause for the ship's get
ting so far out of her course, and ail ques
tioning will only bring the same answer:
"I don't know." Captain Smith and his
officers, except the chief engineer, who is
on the Point Arena, are still on tne wreck,
and until they can be seen nothing definite
can be learned.
Farmers who beard the steamer
whistling for help say they plainly saw
the headlight of the steamer and the light
from the lighthouse. One of the firemen
says the erst officer was on the bridge and
tbat Captain Smith was below when the
steamer struck, but until the excitement
is over nothine can be definitely known.
Tue steamer Weott's gun for throwing
lifelines arrived at sundown, but it proved
no better than the shotguns and rifles,
and no line has reached the unfortunates
yet
Great indignation is expressed by those
on shore at the seeming indifference of
the owners, as they could have had a tug
here by dark with everything necessary to
rescue the poor fellows.
So far not a body has been washed
ashore. The town of Point A.rena is de
serted, and there ore at least 300 people at
the scene of the wreck, who will watch all
night, ready to risK their lives to succor
the men in the rigging. The crew of the
boat from Point Areua who risked their
lives to-day are all heroes, and Messrs.
Cauehey, Lazarus, Cunningham ' and
Lighthouse-keeper Brownhead and an In
dian, who launched tne boat in the surf,
although they were unsuccessful deserve
medals for their bravery, for few life-sav
ing crews would have risked their lives as
they did to-day.
The steamers Point Arena, Weott and
Alcazar are still lying as close to the
wreck as possible, waiting until it will
not be positive suicide to send their boats
in to the doomed vessel. The survivors
who are on shore will not leave the beach,
and have hardly tasted food since being
rescued, as they say the food would choke
â¢tnern should they eat while their com
rades are suffering within speaking dis
tance.
Another party just arrived says the land
watchers are wide-awake and the poor fel
lows still in the rigging. They do not
tdink any one has been washed off since
dark, as the tide has gone out and the
spray does not dash as high, but a heavy
sea is still running.
The rescued men still refuse to talk or
give any opinion. It is apparent that they
do not intend to injure any one by saying
anything until they can see some of their
superior officer*.
POINT ARENA, Cal., Nov. 23.â A man
just come from the wreck (at 1:30 o'clock)
says the men have all cone from the rig
ging into the pilot-house. The sea is still
very rough. He heard a cry of "Man
overboard 1" just before he left, bnt could
see nothing. All three steamers are on
duty yet outside.
The men are now working here in a
blacksmith shop making bolts to shoot
from a gun to take a line across the wreck.
The> think they can get a line across be
fore daylight. Big fires are kept going at
the wreck.
HISTORY OF THE SAN REDITO.

Port Townsend, the Araeo was lost at

phere that surrounded the doomed ship.
Leaving Tacoma last Wednesday night or
Thursday morning, the steamer probably
had fair weather for twenty-four hours
and then ran into the southeaster that
swept over the City on Saturday night.
Just how Captain Smith managed to get
out of h!s course and allow his vessel to
go ashore above Point Arena remains to be
told.
The following is a list of the crew of the

This makes a crew of forty-three men.

The San BÂ«nito carried a cargo of 5000
tons of Carbon Hill coal consigned to the
Sou'hern Pacific Railroad Company. Bhe
was bound from Tacoma to San Francisco,
and usually made three trips a muntb be
tween these ports. The Carbon Hill Coal
Company is one of the smaller wheels
wilbin the large wheel of the Southern
Pacific Company. The San Benito usu
ally made the down trip in three days,
and according to this reckoning she left
Tacoma some time last Thursday.
The San Benito mases the fourth ship
lost in the last few* years by the Pacific
Improvement Company. The others were
the Tacoma, built by the Cramps, which
went ashore on her first round trip after
roui/ding the Horn ; the San Pedro, which
wen 1 ashore in November, 1891, on
Brotchey Ledge. Vancouver Island, while
in clj.arge of an English pilot, and the San
Pab'o, which went down while chartered
on toe China run.
Tr*e San Benito was rieeed as a three
masted schooner and was of 3789 tons
gross burden. She was built in Scotland
in 1884, and when launched was called the
Kimberly. For some time she ran in the
South African trade, and later was sent
across the Atlantic with a general cargo

for Philadelph'a. She went ashore in a
hurricane and C. P. Huntington bought
the wreck for $500. The Kimberly was
taken to Newport News and there was
renamed the San BeDito, and when
launched again the American flag flew at
hex mizzeu. She came around the Horn
in 1889 with a cargo of cement and oil,
and ever since has been carrying coal
from Puget Sound for the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company.
Once before the San Benito was ashore
in almost precisely the same position and
in the same place as she is now. On that
occasion she got off, but Captain Colville,
who was then in command, failed to re
port the matter to the Inspectors of Hulls
and Boilers. In consequence, when the
annual inspection took place, the dents in
the bottom plates were found atrd the
story came out. As a result Captain Col
ville was suspended and Captain William
Smith took his place.
Captain Smith has been connected with
several unlucky ships, but this is the first
time he has ever had an accident scored
against him. In the old days he was mas
ter of the British ship Barnard Castle.
Soon after he left that vessel she crashed
onto Race Rock and became a total loss.
Next Captain Smith went as third officer
of the steamer Wellington, and later was
made master of the San Mateo. From
that steamer he was transferred to the San
Benito, and had been captain of her up to
the time of the disaster.
Chief Engineer I. W. Wood has had a
really remarkable experience while in the
employ of the Pacific Improvement Com
pany. He came around the Horn in the
Tacoma, and was in the engineer's depart
ment when that vessel was lost. He was
first assistant engineer of the San Pablo
when that vessel went ashore, and was
chief engineer of the San Pedro when it
was wrecked on the rocks at the entrance
to the harbor of Victoria, B. C. Now he
is chief of the San Benito when she is
being dashed to pieces on the rocks near
Point Arena. Chief Engineer Wood is a
nephew of Captain diaries Goodail of
Goodall, Perkins & Co.
First Assistant Scott and Second Assist
ant Condon are both well Known in ma
rine circles, but this will be their first ex
perience in a shipwreck. Chief Officer
Zolline and Second Officer Swan have
been with the San Benito for years and
are two of the most carelul officers who
sail out of the Golden Gate.
The San Benito was 340 feet long, 41
feet 2 inches broad and 17 feet 7 inches
deep. The managing owner was F. S.
Douty, secretary of the Pacific Improve
ment Company. The wrecker Whitelaw
left for the scene of the wreck last night
and Manager Schwerin of ihe Southern
Pacific went along to see what could be
done to salve the doomed steamer.
The Condon family have been very un
fortunate, as among the drowned is Sec
ond Assistant Condon, whose father was
chief engineer of the Bertha. Last year,
when the steamer was on her way to
Alaska, Condon Sr. was washed overboard
and drowned. The brother of the two
men who lost their lives at sea is chief en
gineer of the Spreckels tug Reliance.
PLEASED WITH THE PLAY.
Bryan Glad to Meat After Ilia Campaign
of Xalktng.
LINCOLN, Nkbr., Nov. 22.â W. J. Bryan
reached Lincoln from his Missouri hunt
ing trip to-night. He came alone and
was driven directly to his home. Mr.
Bryan said his outing was a thoroughly
enjoyable one, and being the first genuine
play spell since his nomination for the
Presidency at Chicago, he felt sreatly re*
freshed for having taken it He met a
number of warm friends in the cities
visited who helped to make his visit pleas
urable. Mr. Bryan's presence on the in
coming train was not generally known in
the towns through which he passed to
day, and it was a matter of some satisfac
tion to him that such was the case, as be
did not care to make any addresses on the
Sabbath. His homeward journey was an
eventfnl. To-morrow evening he will
leave for Denver, reaching there eerly
Tuesday morning. Mrs. Bryan will not
accompany him, as stated in a dispatch
from Springfield, Mo. He expects to be
back Dy Thursday.
Home of the Polish Alliance.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 22.â The new
borne of the Polish .National Alliance at
Division and Noble streets was formally
dedicated to the use of the alliance this
afternoon. Impressive ceremonies were
held under the auspices of the local
alliance, and were participated in by dis
tinguished Polisu citizens from all parts
of the country. Chicago is said to have
more Poles among its residents than re
main in Poland, and is the headquarters
of the National Alliance, which was or
ganized in 1 880.
Keepers of a " Cum " Caught.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 22.â Louis Harter
and his wife were arrested at their home,
991 Seminary avenue, this evening, and
the police found about $800 worth of stolen
property concealed in the house. Most of
it had been taken from the big depart
ment stores on State street, and the police
believe that the prisoners have been con
ducting a "fence" for other thieves.
Attempt to Hum a Hotel.
CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., Nov. 22.â An
attempt was made early yesterday to
burn the Travelers' Home, a hotel in Old
Town. That the fire was of incendiary
origin was proven by the fact that the oil
haa been scattered about the building.
The hotel was not badly damaged, as the
flames were quickly extinguished. There
were between fifteen and twenty people
asleep in the hotel at the time.
A WINGED SHIP
IN THE SKY
Cbntinued from Urtt Page.
He said: "Mr. Collins, I have known
you for a long time to be a reputable man,
and one who has a character to sustain.
Now, on your honor as a professional
man, do you profess to believe all that
you have said and to put confidence in
the scheme of this inventor?"
"From what I have seen of the man
and his invention," said Mr. Collins, "I
have no alternative but to believe im
plicitly all I have said."
General W. H. H. Hart met Mr. Collins
in San Francisco to-day and talked with
him about the discovery. "I have no
doubt," said the general, "that this affair
is bona fide. I have seen the thing in the
air myself, and believe the ideas of this
Oroville inventor have proved to be prac
ticable."
Mr. Tyler, assistant librarian of the San
Francisco Law Library, was in company
with his sister and Mrs. Philbrook on
Friday evening and distinctly saw the
airship a little later than it was seen in
Oakland. This evidence fully bears out
the statement of the passengers and
motor-man of the Piedmont car, who
asserted that after it bad passed over St.
Mary's College it was headed for. San
Francisco. It was reported to-night that
a newspaper which has up to this time ap
parently been unaware that an airship
has been flying around the State was in
tending to credit the discovery to a young
dentut at Oroville. Mr. Collins was
asked about this and said that it was
absolutely without foundation, that the
inventor is not a aentist and is nearly 50
years of age.
Nautical men who have paid particular
attention to the various descriptions of
eye-witnesses of this airship declare that
the inventor has carefully followed out
the principle of flying exemplified by the
albatross. The machine itself closely re
sembles a bird, and when all the facts
connected with its construction are made
known it will doubtless be learned that
the Oroville man took a seabird for his
model and drew from it his inspiration.
SACRAMENTANS STARTLED
Thousands View the Great Airship
With Wonder.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 22â The en
tire city is in a fever of excitement, and
all that can be heard on every side is air
ship, airship, airship. The mysterious
aerial traveler paid this city another visit
this evening, and this time it passed
directly over the downtown portion of the
city and exhibited to wondering thousands
of the citizens its magnificent searchlight.
There could be no possible mistake, tor
there in plain view of all, moving slowly
along with a slight wavering motion, was
a large electric light, fully twice the
candle-power of an ordinary arc ligiit.
The light was at an enormous height and
still plainly visible, as the heavens were
entirely obscured by a mass of dark clouds,
which every moment threatened to burst
into a drenching rain, and in consequence
the mysterious light was thrown into in
tense relief against their dark background.
The light first made its appearance over
the lower portion of the city, and was
moving slowly into the wind in a south
westerly direction. One ot the first to see
it was Isaac Gough on Second and X
streets. As soon as he became fully satis
tied that it was the much-talked-of aerial
visitant he gave notice to all in the sur
rounding stores and hotels, and within a
few minutes the streets were black with
masses of excited people, all gazing
heavenward.
As the news spread the housetops be
came black with people, and frantic men
rushed wildly into telephonic communi
cation with their homes in order to in
form their wives and families that high up
in the heavens human beings were gayly
sailing through the air toward San Fran
cisco. The streetcars were an important
factor also in spreading the information
aa the motormen shouted the news to the
bystanders as their cars rapidly threaded
their nay through the crowded thorough
fares, and it needed but a wave of the
hand skyward to draw the attention of all
to the heavens.
Jacob Zemansky, the well-known down
town cigar man, obtained a powerful tele
scope and watched the light until it faded
into DotbinznesÃ in the distance. In
speaking of it he said: "It simply passes
my understanding. If that was not an
electric arc light of intense power then I
never saw one. Looking at it with the
naked eye it seemed to move in a straight
line, but seen through the glass it rose
and fell like a boat on a gently swelling
tide. I could not distinguish any posi
tive shape, only a dare mass of mistlike
substance to which the light seemed to be
attached."
Mr. Car rag bar of the Saddlerock Restau
rant also gives a similar description of the
light and its movement!, and states that
in his opinion it was attached to an air
vessel of some description, and after being
in plain sight for over twenty minutes it
faded away in the distance.
Of the thousands who viewed the mys
terious visitant this evening, the vast ma
jority had been among the ranks of the
most pronounced skeptics ever since the
hrst publication of the subject in Tues
day's Call, for the reason that they are
living in the lower part of the city and
had failed to catch a glimpse of the light
on its previous appearance, and in conse
quence its reappearance descended upon
them like a clap of thunder out of a clear
sky. For over a week they had laughed
and jeered and treated the subject with
scorn and derision, but here before their
very eyes was the self-same vision which
had greeted their friends and neighbors
in the eastern portion of the city, and they
were forced by the evidence ol their own
eyes to abandon their unbelief.
As soon as it became fully evident to
all that the light was no meteor or ?tar, a
thousand stories were related of what
people had heard and seen on its previous
visitation.
Mr. Johnson, foreman of the Haegin
ranch, in company with another gentle
man, was driving across the bare plains
adjacent to the city last Tuesday nignt
whea they plainly heard a merry chorus
of human voices. The thing was un
canny and unreal. They were entirely
alone; on all tides stretched bare fields
without a bush or fence, no human being
was visible, nor was there a possibility of
secretion, and yet the merry chorus rang
out distinct, but faint. They stopped
their team and listened and looked, saw
the clear bright lignt high over their
beads, bat did not dream that but a short
distance above them human beings were
floating along on the night wind and fear
ing the riaicule of their acquaintances,
held their peace.
Another story which has come to light
is that an employe of the paint shop of
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
ATTORNEY GEORGE D. COLLINS, Who Knows the Inventor
of the Great Airship.
has received a letter from one of the in
mates of the aerial ship, who was an old
acquaintance. This letter, postmarked
Oakland, stated that the writer had
made one of the crew of an airship which
made a most successful voyage last Tues
day night, and bad arrived in the vicinity
of Oakland about 12 o'clock. He stated
that the ship had worked beautifully
with tne exception that the motion was
very disagreeable.
He also stated that after making altera
tions and receiving patent rights the
vessel would be placed on exhibition, and
that this would occur before the first of
the coming month. It is claimed that
the painter's shopmates laughed the letter
to scorn, and that he wan so thoroughly
convinced that his friend was not mis
leading him that he wagered $20 that
what his friend bad written would come
to pass. This story was related by sev
eral, but is not authenticated, as they
would not betray the writer's name with
out his permission.
Colvin Brown, local representative of the
Chronicle, waÃ an eye witness of the mys
terious light thio evening. He has been
a skeptic of the most pronounced type
and was loth to believe the evidence of his
own eyes. Center of a group of the corner
of Seventh and X streets, he produced an
almanac to evdeavor to prove that the
planet Venus had left her orbit and was
coquetting with Sacramento. As his ex
planation was not received with favor he
started off in search of Sergeant Barwick
of weather fame to endeavor to prove the
mysterious light to be a meteor on the
warpath.
Of all the onlookers this evening the
employes of the streetcar system are the
most jubilant. They have been held up
to derision for over a week ; their lives
made miserable by jocular inquiries as to
the nature of the stimulants they mostly
imbibe and various inquiries as to when
ttsev intended to take a trip, etc.
"I am heartily delighted tbat the entire
city has seen this mysterious light to
night," said one of the motormen. "Now
thi9 eternal joshinz will cease. My life
has been a misery for the past week, but
i*ow all can see for themselves tbat we
were not stretching the long bow. It is
particularly aggravating, when one
plainly sets a phenomenal occurrence and
relates it, that he is treated as a gigantic
liar."
Assistant Superintendent Rosa of the
streetcar system is also jubilant. "I was
simply positive," said be. "that this light
was of an electrical nature. I heve made
a close study of this mysterious agent for
years. I saw this moving light for upward
of thirty minutes Tuesday night and was
positive that it was electrical. Also I
noticedits swaying and rising and falling
movement and was convinced in my
own mind that it was attached to a vehicle
of some nature. At first I thought it
might be in a balloon, but Knowing that
machinery requisite to produce a light of
t at volume and intensity would weigh
upward of a ton, I concluded that it might
possibly be that some one had solved the
problem of aerial navigation, and this be
lief was strengthened by observing that
the light was moving south against the
wind. lam now almost convinced that
the great problem has been solved and
that within a short time the air will be
peopled with ships."
This seems to be the public belief in this
city to-night among all who have wit
nessed the reappearance of this myster
ious light and never has there been wit
nessed such an overwhelming and sudden
change in public opinion as its reappear
ance has caused. In the corridors of the
hoteia groups of excited people clustered
discussing all the possibilities of this won
derful discovery. In the saloons healths
are being drunk to the successful discov
erer, and on all aides universal belief has
taken the piace of skepticism. Since the
reappearance of this mysterious light this
evening there has been a general search
made for copies of Wednesday's Call
which gave an exclusive account of the
first appearance of the aerial visitant and
a copy cannot be purchased for love or
money. Those possessing them brought
tbem out to read to their friends but re
fused to part with them.
OTHERS WHO SAW IT.
Stories That Corroborate the Fact
of the Invention.
The following letter from San Rafael
explains a phase of tne story that has not
yet come to light:
Ban Rafael, Nov. 22, 1896.
Editor Call: The mysterious light mentioned
in your valuable Daper this morning as seen
by several citizens in different parts of the
State, and which seems to mystify yourself as
well as your readers, is nothing more than an
airship, and of this fact I am perfectly cogni
zant. I think now that I am released of my
obligation of .secrecy, which I have kept for
nearly three months, as the experiment in
aerial navigation is a fixed fact and the public
or a few of the public at least have seen its
workings in the air.
In the latter part of last August I was hunt
ing in the Tamnlpais range of mountains, be
tween the hit k peak and Boliuas Bay. I
wounded a deer, and in chasing it I ran onto
a circular brushpile about ten feet in height in
a part of the mountain seldom visited even by
hunters. ,
I was somewhat astonished, and my curi
osity prompted me to approach it, when I en
countered a man who sang out: "What are
you doing here and what do you want?" I re
plied that "I had wounded a deer and was
chasing It." He said "that they had been
camping here for a month or so and had not
seen a deer, but if you think your deer is in
the neighborhood I will assist you in finding
it as we need a little meat in cam p." This mau
vent with me and in less than 500 yards
found my deer. We carried it into the brush
corral. And what a sightâ a perfect machine
shop and an almost completed ship. I was
sworn to secrecy and have kept it till thi3 mo
ment. Six men were at work on the "aerial
Hhip." It is this ship that a few people have
seen at night on its trial trip. It returns to its
home before daylight and will continue to do
so until perfected. Yours, William Jordon.
E. A. Lamkin of 305 Larkin street says
he saw the airship at an early hour last
night making its way toward Sacramento
and soon fading away in the distance like
a falling meteor.
Walter Malloy, deputy sheriff and com
missary at the County Jail, says the light
of the airship was seen in San Francisco
Tuesday evening. His statement is as
follows:
"When I left the jail on Tuesday night
I happened to look in the direction of
Berkeley and I saw an unusual sight. It
was a strong white light, seemingly
moving. I thought at first it was a bal
loon with a lantern attached, but on a
closer observation I thought I recognized
a dark body immediately over the light,
somewhat of a different shape from a
balloon. The more I observed it the more
puzzled I became as to what it was.
Finally I dismissed it from my mind until
next mornine, wnen reading The Cali. I
saw that others had noticed the strange
light. Now I am fully convinced that
what I saw was the airship seen by others
who were nearer to it than I was. Yet
from my position on Kearny and Broad
way I had a good view of it and I am
ready to indorse what others have said re
garding its appearance."
Max Roberts, an employe of the West
ern Union Telegraph Company, engaged
in the capacity of a night watchman, says
he saw the airship about 11:50 o'clock
Wednesday night.
AN EXPERT'S OPINION.
Lieutenant George N. Chase,
U. S. A., Talks of the Won
derful Discovery.
Lieutenant George N. Chase, U. S. A.,
the inventor of an "aerodromic system of
transportation," was seen yesterday on
the subject at his residence ir. Oakland.
Mr. Chase has spent many years in in
vestigating the subject of aerial naviga
tion, and is thoroughly conversant with
the practical and theoretical difficulties
in its way. He has written a pamphlet
setting forth his ideas, and outlining a
sort of compromise between aerial navi
gation and the present system of trans
portation, which many engineers have
accepted as in the highest sense practical.
He said yesterday: "I have read some
of the accounts of the alleged 'airship.'
One in a morning paper yesterday was
rather confusing. The attorney for the
inventor in his statement say i that it is
150 feet Jong, and that the inventor
'moved some of the mechanism,' and
thereafter he saw it rise, the vings flap
ping to a height of about 90 f eÂ« t, making
a series of circles, and descenU, etc He
says also: 'There was no mot ye power,
so far as I could see.' For a ptitent attor
ney who made the application for the
patent and drew up the specifications
this is a remarkable statement. He says
that his client has 'forsaken the ideas of
Maxim and Langley,' and yet states that
'it is built on the aeroplane system,' the
only system ever advocated by eitherâ a
system which I showed in my monograph
published in St. Louis in 1894 was the
only possible one. As I said then:
Experiment has demonstrated the fact that
it Is possible to construct a vehicle possessing
the ability to arise in the air, carrying a con
siderable load, and capable ol being propelled.
The obstacles that have so far bt ffled mans
ingenuity are his ability to control the ma
chine even under the most favorable circum
stances and his failure to provide energy
enough to propel it to any considerable dis
tance. This latter difficulty cannot be over
come by any Known method of storing up po
tential energy in a structure which Is designed j
to sever all connection with terra fitma and
In which levity becomes of primal import
ance. â¢ â¢ â¢ Flight is not a function of
levity but o( weight and power. Man if he
ever fly must closely imitate the flight of
birds. The fledgeling, after one or two abor
tive attempts, adjusts its motions successfully
and naturally to the accomplishment of per
fect flight. The rate of vibration of its wings
and the inclination of their surfaces to the
varying direction of the wind to the line oi
flight are instinctively changed wlih thÂ« ra
pidity of lightning. Giueu a machine which
is capable of performing all the essential
functions of a bird in flight it is extremely
doubtful if the coolest human intellect could
ever be trained to control it safely under all
the conditions and circumstances whichjit
must inevitably encounter.
Â£While I said," continued Mr. Chsse,
"that the conditions seem too many, or,
rather the unknown quantities are at
present too few, lor a satisfactory solution
of this problem pure and simple, still it
must be conceded that considerable

PASSED OVER SAN JOSE.
The Air Craft Said to Have Been
Seen Sailing Toward Mount
Hamilton.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Nov. 22. â Frank
Everett, a young man residing in this
city, claims to have seen the mysterious
airship seen by the residents of Sacra
mento and elsewhere pass over the eastern
portion of this city about 11 o'clock to
night.
Everett said he was standing on Santa
Clara street, near East San Jose, wnen be
distinctly saw the airsnip high up in the
heavens. He claims that several persons
who were in that vicinity also saw the
ship, and that others whose attention wa3
called to it saw the flashlight of the craft
rapidly disappear. The ship was said to
be going in a southeasterly direction, to
ward Mount Hamilton.
H. Erlich drove up while the crowd was
standing gazing skyward and saw the
light disappearing. To him some of the
people said they distinctly saw the ship.
Neither he nor Everett knew the names of
any persons in the crowd, most of whom
were in carriages.
Experimenters Near Oroville.
OROVILLE, Cal., Nov. 22.â There seems
to be some foundation that the airship
which recently passed over Sacramento
was built in this neighborhood, but no in
formation can be obtained as to who the
builder could be. Rumor has it that two
parties were recently experimenting with
new and light gas which they expected
would outdo anything yet introduced for
balloon purposes. It is also asserted by
others that three or four comparatively
unknown parties of wealth have been for
several weeks experimenting with various
gases and feel confident of 3olving aerial
navigation.

Weapons and Many May Die
From Injuries-
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 22.â A riot
â¢ occurred on the West Side here to-nigbt
"-.' between a score of Hungarians and as
many Irishmen, in which many men were
stabbed. Dirks, knives and clubs were
freely used and nearly all of the com
batants were more or less injured. Two
men were taken to the hospital in a dying
condition, two others cannot survive their
wounds and many are dangerously
wounded. The police arrived on the scene
' after the affair had been iv progress for
half an hour. They took seven men to
* jail and more will be arrested. The place
I where the trouble occurred is on Frank
lin-avenue extension, near Columbia
street, a district inhabited by Hungarians
and Irish-Americans.
About 6 o'clock Joseph and John
Sprends and James Carter became en
gaged in a quarrel. In the melee John
Sprends drew a pocket-knife and stabbed
Carter several times in the head. Mean
while Sylvester Carter, father of the boy,
arrived on the scene. He struck one of
the Sprends and was immediately knocked
down and brutally stabbed in the head
and back. He will die. By this time all
, (he Hungarians on the hill were out and
â  . taking a hand in the row.
The word was quickly passed among the
Irish that an Irishman was being killed.
The report had the effect of a spark on dry
tinder. In an instant fifty or more Irish
men were on the scene. With a whoop
they waded into the fray. More Hunga
rians came. Everybody was armed either
.with knife or club. Then ensued the live
liest mix up in the history of Cleveland.
â  Clubs were raited and slung with terrific
effect. A patrol wagon packed with po
lice officers dashed into the crowd of bat
tling men. There was a rush for escape,
and nearly all who were not too severely
wounded to run did get away.
The police found lying on the battle
field James Carter, who was stabbed in
, . the head and had his skull fractured; his
"father, Sylvester Carter, twenty stab
wounds; Billy Maloney, twelve deep stab
wounds and head supposed to be frac
.tured; Adam Shierman, stabbed three
times and blade broken off in a wound;
John O'Neill, stabbed in face and back;
Henry Schaefer, clubbed into insensibil
ity; William Zieker, cut in head and in
jured internally from being jure ped upon.
"Malloy was unmercifully clubbed and
slashed. Ue wae stabbed in the head and
â¢ back fully a dozen times. After receiving
the first cut he tried to escape by running
down Franklin street. He was pursued
by the swarthy Huns, who kept sinking
their knives and dirks into his back while
running. He finally dropped from weak
ness. Shierman received two stabs in the
head and an ugiy gasb in the right shoul
der-blade, and a portion of the blade is
still in his back.
The police arrested John and Joseph
Sprends, Michael Zieker, Antone Ballash,
2-1 years old; Michael Zieks and John
Spousler. They were locked up, charged
with rioting and cutting to wound. A
general alarm was sent out and the police
â¢. are now searching for other rioters.
CONFESSES A FIENDISH CRIME.
Charles H. Elliott Admits Having Killed
Guy Hutsonpiller, His Comrade
and Roommate.
OMAHA, Nebb., Nov. 22.â Charles H.
EUiott, or George Elliott, who was ar
rested at Cedar Rapids, lowa, on a train
from Oma^a, and is now in the County
Jail charged with the murder of his friend
and roommate, Guy Hutsonpilier, made a
confession to-day in the presence of wit
nesses, admitting that he killed Hutson
piller, but claiming that he committed
the crime in the beat of passion and that
he did not realize until afterward the en
ormity of his deed. The police still be
lieve the murder premeditated, and claim
â¢ the confession is made in the hope of se
curing a lesser punishment.
According to the statement of the pris
oner he had a dispute with Hutsonpiller
over a small balance, and both losing their
temper a quarrel resulted in which he
says, his friend threatened to whip him.'
He tden picked up a coupling t>in which
was in the room and struck Hutsonpilier
on the head with it. He then went out
and purchased some chloroform with
which he saturated a towel and placed it
over the injured man's face. He *ays that
Hutsonpiller was alive and he left him so,
and when he had attended to settling his
bills he left town. He declares that h*
had no knowledge of bis friend's death
until after his arrest. After he first hit
Hutsonpiller, he says, his mind became
confused, and except for the chloroform
incident he can remember nothing until
he started for the depot. He admits hav
ing taken $21 35 from bis roommate's
pockets, but insists tbat his story of re
ceiving $100 in a letter the day before the
killing is true.

Chandler of New Hampshire is at the
Fifth-avenue Hotel. In conversation
with a representative of the United Asso
ciated Presses to-day he denied that he
was seeking a Cabinet position, but said
tbat the Republicans of New Hampshire
' would like to see Governor Buseil in the
Cabinet. With regard to the tariff, he
stated that he differed with John Sher
man's views recently expressed on that
matter and aaid:
"The reason Senator Aldrich made the
statement tbat no tariff legislation could
ue enacted this coming session was to
counteract the effect of what Senator
Sherman had aaid. I agree with Senator
Alarich. Senator Sherman being at the
bead of the Finance Committee and en
joying great distinction, made the asser
tion that the Dingley bill could pass.
This would naturally create the impres
sion that we would soon have relief in
that direction. It is a seriout question
whether it could pass or not. but the
chances are that it would not."
He was oi tho opinion, however, that
the provipious of the Dingley bill provid
ing for the issue of short-time bonds to the
amount of $50,000,000 could be passed and
for the present the expenses of the Gov
ernment could be tided over. He ex
pressed himself as in favor of the passage
of this provision.
"I am ODposed to the hurrying through
of any imperfect tariff measure," he added.
"Better tate time and pass a bill that will
suit and give general satisfaction." The
Senator said he did not believe in trying
to read out of the party certain Republi
cans who were for silver. He declared
that he looked on them still as good Re
publicans and felt they would co-operate
with the Republicans in passing a tariff
measure.
COLLAPSE OF THE NAIL TRUST.
Ruinous Expenditures in Buying Up Com-
petitors and Paying "Inspectors" Force
the Combine to the Wall.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 22.â A morning
paper says: The great wire-nail trust
which has levied tribute on the people of
the United States since January 1, 1895,
has coilapsed, and will endeavor to wind
up its affairs by December 1. Sales agents
representing miils within the pool were
yesterday scrambling to sell nails at $1 70
per keg in Chicago, wh.ch is precisely $1
per keg below the trust's circular price,
and jobbers were selling in lots of from 1
to 1000 kegs from store at $2 per keg. Be
fore the end of the present week the price
will undoubtedly be down to $1 25 per
keg, or within 30 cents of the lowest price
they ever sold here. The trust has thrown
up both hands, and in a circular to the
jobbers gives them liberty to sell at any
price they please.
Troubles have multiplied on the trust's
head very rapidly during the last ei^ht
months. In that time the stream of dol
lars which poured into its coffers during
the early months of its career had to be
used to buy up at rouud prices the oppo
sition mills which sprang up on all sides,
as well as to meet a multitude of other
expenses. Not the least of these was the
maintenance of a regular force of in
spectors almost as large as the Govern
ment's secret service, to keep all the
members of the pool "toting fair." For
this and kindred purposes the trust im
posed a personal tax of f 1 50 per keg on
all the nails sold by its members, and re
bated to them the difference after the ob
jects sought rere accomplished. A fund
of $1,500,000 was returned to members on
the showing made four months ago, but
since that time the trust's officials and
commissioners have incurred liabilities of
mucn more than this in their desperate
tight to keep the trust going. These lia
bilities will have to be met by the mdi'
vidual mills composing the trust, aud a
long drawn out period of litigation is
highly probable.
The advance of 15 cents per keg, ordered
by the trust at its March meeting in this
city.was the act which marked the trust's
downfall. This put the base price of nails
at Pittsburg at $2 55, which under the pe
culiar terms of its nail card meant that
the lowest figures at which any nails
could be bought there was |3 05 per Keg.
This meant $3 20 in Chicago, and made
the range of commercial nails to the West
ern consumer $4 to $5 per keg. This re
sulted in an immense curtailment of the
demand and in turn forced the trust to
close up 90 per cent of its mills and throw
its workmen out of employment in order
to reduce the output to comply with cur
rent needs. The entire sales of nails by
the trust mills during July were but 20,
-000 kegs and in August but 25,000 kegs,
though the output agreed upon for these
months was 60,000 and 50,000 kegs respec
tively. The March output reached 950,000
kegs.
J. H. Parks of 608 Sears building, Boston,
was the originator of the pool and was its
"commissioner." To him was delegated
the task of holding the association to
gether, and for this service he collected
one cent per keg on each keg of nails sold
in this country, besides a large appropri
ation for "secretaries' " salaries and main
tenance of the inspection bureau. The
association now has on its hands a large
collection of leases of factories which it
closed up; also numerous contracts with
manufacturers of nail-making machinery
who were prevented from selling to the
trust's competitors.

FIVE CHILDREN BURNED TO DEATH.
Perished in a Burning Residence While
Their Parents Were Away Attend
ing a Dance.
HAMILTON, Mo., Nov. 22.â A few miles
north of here five children of Mr. and
Mrs. Snyder Neal were burned to death
late last night while the parents were at
tending a dance.
Soon after starting home the Neals and
those accompanying them discovered that
the Neai residence was on fire.
When they reached the burning build
ing the father saw his 11-year-old girl ly
ing burning in the front door clasping her
3-year-old brother in her arms. The
flames prevented rescue. The children
were then dead.
The father fell in a . swoon and has bee n
a raving maniac ever since. Nora,
9 years old, is the only survivor of the lire.
She says Callie 13, Hattie 11, Clarence 5,
Julian 3, and herself retired at the usual
hour in an upstairs chamber. The next
she knew the tire was coming through
the floor and soon the room was enveloped
in flames.

LITELY FIGHT AT A MEETING.
Members of the Armenian Revolutionary
Hoextty Aot in Accord
LYNN, Mass., Nov. 22.â A meeting of
the Henchagist Armenian Revolutionary
Society this evening broke up in a lively
fight. Chairs were thrown and knives
drawn, but no one was seriously injured.
There are two brandies of the society in
Lynn, and the meeting was called to con
sider the advisability of combining. Some
Armenians were present, including a
traveling organizer, who had just re
*urÂ°fd from London, England, where be
had been in consultation with the Euro
pean head of the society. Speakers who
addressed the meeting in favor oi amalga
mation were interrupted.
One became angry and asserted that
those responsible for the interruptions
were not members and should not be al
lowed at the meeting. This was the sig
nal for hostilities. Men in the gallery
picxed up the seats ou which they B at and
hurled them at their countrymen on the
floor below, who were not slow to respond
in kind. The row was becoming general
as the malcontents in the gallery nad al
lies in the body of the hall, when a half
dozen police arrived. They cleared the
hall with difficulty.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1896.
CLARA BARTON'S
MISSION OF MERCY
Noble Work Done by the
Representatives of
the Red Cross.
Food and Medicine Given to the
Persecuted Race of
Armenians.
There Is Yet Much to Be Done in
Relieving the Distress of the
A fl cted Christians.
WASHINGTON, D.C., Nov. 22.-Graphic
and complete reports of the American re
lief expedition to Asia Minor last winter,
spring and summer, under the Red Cross,
have been made by Miss Clara Barton,
president, and the officers and agents
associated with her in the mission of
mercy. The reports have been completed
and will soon be published. That of Miss
Barton is quite extensive, covering in a
general way the work of the several expe
ditions sent out from Constantinople, the
details of which their leaders supply. Miss
Barton's references to the attitude oi th -â¢
Turkish Government toward the relief
work she directed are interesting and val
uable, and will have considerable influ
ence on public opinion.
The work undertaken by the American
Red Cross had its inception in the reports
of the terrible sufferings endured by tae
Armenians and from requests of Rev.
Judson Smith of Boston, secretary of the
American Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Missions, and of Spencer Trask,
connected with the National Armenian
committee organized in New York.
The party sailed January '22 on the
steamship New York under grave uncer
tainty as to the Red Cross representatives
being permitted to enter Turkey. The
Turkish Minister's pronunciamento was
found to be official upon arrival at South
ampton, with the proviso, however, that
such persons as United States Minister
Terrell designated would be received. The
general field agent was dispatched to Con
stantinople to center with Minister Ter
rell, while Miss Barton and the rest of the
party remained in London. The confer
ence being satisfactory Miss Barton pro
ceeded to Constantinople, reaching there
February 15, meeting a cordial reception
from the United States officials and from
the missionary board of Constantinople,
to which she refers with much feeling and
respect.
Her first interview with Tewfifc. Pasha,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, in the pres
ence of Miss Terrell, in which Miss Bar
ton explained the objects of the mission
of herself and associates, is especially in
teresting and exhibits the Turkish states
man in an attitude quite attractive.
As will be generally remembered, the
pronuuciamento prohibiting the Red
Cross from going to Turkey was the natu
ral result oi the free expression of our
opinions in public assemblages and
through the press, tio at the beginning
of the wort considerable delay in
sending out the first expedition, arranged
in less than one week after arrival, wa3
caused by the receipt at the Turkish Gov
ernment in Constantinople of a quantity
of American newspaper clippings adverse
in tone to the Turkish administration.
The Government censor wanted to know
what they all meant and whether they
had any connection with Miss Barton's
work before permitting her to proceed.
Translations showed that there was
nothing official in the publications. The
request for delay was withdrawn.
The relief was then carried into the dis
tressed districts by their five expeditions,
under charge of Dr. Hubbell, E. M. Win
stor and C. K. Wood. Dr. Ira Harris of
Tripoli, Syria, in aid of the work, took
charge of the medical relief in Saitoun and
Marash, where 20,000 people were striken
with contagious diseases.
Theseexpeditions penetrated the interior
at a distance of a thousand miles from
Constantinople, going in at the Medi
terranean and out at the Black Sea, cross
ing the Taurus Mountains and the
Euphrates in both the snows of winter
and the suns of midsummer.
Miss Barton speaks ol the labors of her
associates on these expeditions with sin
cere approval, paying them a high com
pliment for their faithfulness and devotion
in the face of almost iuconceivable diffi
culties, which confidence and good-will is
manifestly not without return on their
park
Miss Barton returns thanks to the press
of the United States, to all contributors to
the relief fund, to the National Govern
ment, especially totlie Secretaries of State
and of the Navy, all the officials of the
Unitea States legation in Constantinople,
and to the Embassadors of England, Ger
many and Russia for substantial aid in
carryihg out the purposes of the mission.
In conclusion Miss Barton says not
withstanding all that has been done
through all agencies infinitely more re
mains to be done by some one. "Between
the Archipelago and the Caspian Sea, the
Black Sea and the Mediterranean," she
says, "are to-day living a million and a
half of people of the Armenian race, ex
isting under the ordinances of at least
semi-civilization and professing the re
ligion of Jesus Christ According to the
stated estimate of intelligent and impar
tial observers of various countries and
concurred in by our own agents, whose
observations have been unrestricted, from
100.000 to 200,000 of the personsâ men,
women and children â are destitute of rai
ment, fire, food, medicines and the com
forts that tend to make human life pre
servable, or any means of obtaining them
save through the charitable benÂ«fic ence of
the world. 1 '
BATTLE OF CHURCH FACTIONS.
St. Stanislaus Parish the Scene of a Bitter
Riot During Which Threats of Using
Dynamite Are Made.
BAY CITY, Mich., Nov. 22.â St. Stanis
laus parish, which has at various times
for two years been the scene of incipient
riots over the deposition of its favorite
priest, was the battle-ground at intervals
for seven hours to-day of two factions into
which the parishioners have divided.
When trouble ceased this evening it was
ascertained tbat one policeman and about
twelve of the church members had been
injured, but none seriously.
The trouble started at high mass when
Father Bogacki announced that the anti-
Matitowski faction could not examine the
church accounts. Eighty men left the
church. When mass was over a great mob
had gathered about the vestry door and
refused to permit the pastor to return to
his residence.
Father Bogacki's friends came to his
rescue and there was a regular fight. The
forces of the pastor were repulsed owing
to lack of organization and clubs. When
the police came they clubbed a way for
Father Bogacki and had landed him on
the rectory steps, when the anti-Mat
kowski faction made another charge.
Priests and officers were driven back to
the vestry. Here Father Bogacki re
mained a prisoner without food or drink
until about 7 o'clock this evening, when
Frank McPhillips, editor of the Tribune,
learning that threats of dynamiting the
church bad been made, drove to the scene
and per.-uaded Father Bogacki to quietly
leave the building with him. After the
priest had departed the mob dispersed.
The church was locked by the police and
a strong guard placed in the pastoral resi
dence. To-morrow the church will be
opened. Trouble is expected, as Doth fac
tions will be out in force.
"WHY, THEN, MAY NOT I?"
Rouss, the Sightless Multi-Millionaire,
Hopes to Receive Vision by the
Wonderful X Ray.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 22.â Perhaps
one ol the first to try the new cure for the
blind discovered by Thomas A. Edison,
the wizard of Menlo Park, will be Charles
ii. Rouss, the Bightless multi-millionaire.
Mr. Rouss is eagerly following every one
of Elison's experiments with the Roent
gen rays, and just as soon as he believes
there is a possible chance of success he
will submit himself to the treatment
. Mr. Rouss offered $1,000,000 to any one
who would restore his sight. This offer
attracted everybody from the scientist to
the crank, and Mr. Rouss found it im
possible to try all the remedies offered,
and engaged a young man named John
Martin, also blind, to submit to any and
all tests bafore they were tried on him.
If the wizard will consent, Martin will
probably be his first patient.
Mr. Rouss declares if Mr. Edison thinks
he can do him any eood he is willing to go
out to Menlo Park and stay a year. He is
hopeful of the X rays, too, and points to
the fact that a blind boy in San Francisco
was made to see by them, and aska, ''Why,
then, may not I?"
AN ATTEMPT TO WRECK A TRAIN
Two Rails Fastened Across tbe Track, but
the Plot Was Frustrated by a Timely
Warning.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Nov. 22.â An at
tempt, with a view of robbery, was made
this evening to wreck the Union Pacific
southbound passenger train leaving Ogden
at 6 o'clock and due in Salt Lake an hour
later. The plot was frustrated by the rail
road people receiving an anonymous warn
ing that somethine was going to happen,
in consequence of which the train crew
was re-enforced and instructed to keep a
sharp lookout. The train proceeded very
slowly until it reached a point where two
rails were laid across the track and se
curely fastened in such a way as to cause
derailment had Yhe train been going at or
dinary speed. The spot selected, near
X ivsville, about eighteen miles from Salt
Lake, was miles from any house and an
ideal place for a robbery. Three suspicious
characters have been arrested, but it is
doubtful if tney are the guilty parties.
HORRIBLE DEATH OF A PALLBEARER
Plunges Into a Grave and Is Fatally Injured
by Being Struck by the
Falling Coffin.
DOUBLE SPRINGS, Ala., Nov. 22.â
John Welton met a horrible death at
Shiloh burying-ground, near here, yester
day afternoon. He was one of the pall
bearers at the funeral of Junius Roberts,
a farmer. The coffin was lowered into the
grave by strap?.
The strap held by Welton and another
man snapped as the coffin was beinjr low
ered. Welton lost his balance as the strap
broke and fell headlong into the gr*v<Â»,
which was six feet deep. At ths same
time the rear end of tbe coffin, which had
been held by the broken strap, also
plunged downward. The falling coffin
struck Welton on the head and banned
him against the side of the grave, which
was of hard soil. Mr. Welton was ex
tricated, but died two hours afterward.
COLLOM MAY GET A PLACE.
Poatible Promotion of the Senator to
McKinley't Cabinet.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 22.â A morning
paper says: There was an unusual
amount of talk yesterday among the
Republicans concerning Senator Cul
lom's possible promotion to the Cabinet.
The opinion that he may be recognized by
McKinley is gaining ground, and a good
many men yesterday were wondering who
would be his successor in the Senate if he
did receive a Cabinet portfolio. It is con
ceded that Chicago or Northern Illinois
will name Palmer's successor, and Central
or Southern Illinois undoubtedly would
claim the right of filling the vacancy
which would be occasioned if Senator
Cullom should resign.
It seems the matter has been the subject
of comment in inner Republican circles
for some months, and ex-Governor Fifer
has been sounded time and again as to his
wishes in the premises. Mr. Fifer has
told a number of tbe most prominent
Republicans in Cook County that under
no circumstances would he be a candidate
for the United States Senate or any other
elective office.
TALK ABOUT THE TARIFF.
Visitor* to Major McHinlr.y Discing the
Dinqley Bill.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 22.âPresident
elect McKinley attended divine service
this morning without the company of his
wife, although he took her for a drive
during the early . hours of the forenoon.
This afternoon at the family dinner Major
McKinley had as guests benides Mrs. Mc-
Kinley, Mother McKinley, Miss Helen
McKinley and a sister of Mrs. Abner Mc-
Kinley.
During the past week many of the visit- 1
ing Congressmen have talked tariff with
the President-elect and the Dingley bill
has been the burden of conversation. It
is said a majority of the callers agreed
that, it would not be an easy matter to
pass that measure, and that it would be
wiser to have an extra session of Congress
for the purpose of drafting a new tariff
law.
Major McKinley to-day said he ex
pected to be in Canton Thanksgiving
day.
Sentence of a Bank- Wrecker.
HEBRON, Nebr., Nov. 22.â Captain J.
H. Stickle, for years a leader in politics in
Central Nebraska and president of the de
funct Blue Valley Bank of this place, was
last night convicted of wrecking tbat insti
tution and sentenced to two years in the
penitentiary by Jud^e Hastings. The
specific charge on which he was convicted
was the embezzlement of $800 of the bank's
funds. Captain Stickle made an unsuc
cessful race for Congress as an indepen
dent Republican in the old Second dis
triot.

FARMER MORTON
MAKES A REPORT
Telling Figures Gathered
by the Agricultural
Department.
Improvement in the Force
Causes a Saving of Two Mil
lions in Three Years.
Facts to Show That the United States
Should Control the Markets
of the World.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 22â In his
fourth annual report the Secretary of
Agriculture shows that with $180,000 that
may be saved from the appropriations for
the current fiscal year there will have been
covered back into the treasury Bince
March 7, 1893, over $2,000,000. That this
great economy was effected without any
loss of efficiency he attributes in a large
degree to the improvement in the per
sonnel of the force under the civil service
rules.
One more step Secretary Morton deems
necessary to complete the system of civil
service In his department. This is the
appointment of a director in charge of
bureaus and scientific investigations, who
shall be designated to serve as acting Sec
retary in case of absence simultaneously
of tbe Secretary and Assistant Secretary.
He declares that the chiefs of the scientific
bureaus and their divisions and their as
sistants do the actual thinkiner and rea
soning for the development of agricul
tural science, and adus that the persons
are not adequately compensated. He
states that during the past few years no
less than thirty-two skilled experts in the
department service have left it to take
positions in institutions of learning at sal
aries averaging fully 50 per cent highex
than they were getting from the Govern
ment. The inspection of animals intended
for food is treated at length.
Mr. Morton urges that the Government
inspection should be extended to all ani
mals intended for human food, whether
for consumption in the United States or
abroad ; but he maintains tbat the cost of
this inspection should be paid by the
packers. The total consumption of meat
in Great Britain for the year was 1,100,000
tons, 75 per cent of which was produced
at home, the remaining 25 per cent being
produced abroad. Of the live meat arriv
ing in Great Britain during the first half
of the year 1896 the United States supplied
75 per cent of the cattle and 45 per cent of
the sheep. The testimony of the depart
ment reports abroad is that cattle from
the United States arrive in English ports
in excellent condition. The Glasgow mar
ket is especially commended to American
shippers, as in that city cattle from the
United States compete with the very high
est quality of British cnimals.
American packers are not participating
in the profits of the growth in consump
tion of swineflesb and hog products in
Great Britain as much as they ought, be
cause they do not cure meats to suit to
British demand; on the other hand, Dan
ish and Canadian packers are increasing
their shipments every year. American
bacon averages about 2 cents per pound
below Continental and Irish bacon, and
about 3 cents below English.
The shipment of American horses to
England is steadily increasing. In 1893
Great Britain took 13,573 American horses,
nearly 23,000 in 1894 and 34,000 in 1895,
but during the first nine mouths of 189b"
more American horses were shipped into
England than in any previous twelve
months.
The seeds distributed gratuitously by
the Government during the present fiscal
year weighed 230 tons and occupied thirty
mailcars in transit. The cost of carry
ing them through the mails was over $70,
-000. Enough seed was sent out gratuit
ously to plant 115 square miles of garden.
Each Congressman received enough to
plant 163)^ acres. For the current year at
present prices, the amount required by
Congress to be expended in the purchase
of seed will make each Congressman's
quota double what it was last year. The
becretary regrets this unnecessary and
wasteful expenditure of public money,
and hopes Congress may in good time put
a stop thereto.
Secretary Morton refutes the idea pre
vailing that the farms of the West and
South are more heavily burdened with
mortgages than those of the East and
Northeast. States along the North
Atlantic, he says, are quito heavily incum
bered with farm mortgages, and New
Jersey carries a debt of this kind greater
in proportion to its farm valuations than
any State in the Union.
Referring to the stress of competition
which the American farmer is compelled
to endure, Mr. Morton calls attention to
nearly 2,000,000 farms of eighty acres each
given away by the Government under the
homestead act of 18(36 during tbe past
thirty years, and to the amount donated
under the timber-culture law, equivalent
to over 550.00U more farms of the same
bize. It waa impossible, he says, for
farmers in the old States to profitaoly sell
their products in competition with those
of the newer States, grown upon lands
which cost their owners nothing.
Referring to the impression that greater
rates of interest are charged for money
loaned upon farms than that loaned on
other Kinds of real estate, Secretary Mor
ton states that the rate of interest charged
upon mortgages or residential property
other than farms averages eighty-four
hundredths of 1 per cent less than the
rate of interest charged upon farm loans.
In seventeen States the average rate
charged on the latter is less than that de
manded foi loans upon other residential
property.
In two States the rates are the same
upon urban and real estate. In Pennsyl
vania, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Wisconsin, Kansas, lowa,
Texas and Alabama ihe rates of interest
are less for money secured by mortgages
than for money secured by other reaitv.
In five States, including Kansas, the dif
ference in favor of the former is from one
fourth to one-half of one per cent, and in
Texas it is over one per cent. If the West
ern farmer pays a higher rate of interest
than the Eastern so does the Western
merchant and manufacturer.
During the fiscal year just ended the ex
ported products of American farms aggre
gated $570,000,000, an increase of $17,000,000
over the preceding. In spite of this there
was a falling off in the percentage of agri
cultural products exported to the total ex
ports, but this was due to the unprece
dented sale abroad of American manufac
tured goods. The principal market for
American products is found in tbe United
Kingdom of Great Britain and her colo
nies.
These English-speaking people bought
58 per cent of exports from the United
Suites during the fiscal year 1896. Together
with Germany, France, Holland and Bel
gium they purchased 81.9 per cent of our
entire output, leaving 18.1 per cent for the
rest of the world.
Secretary Morton asks if a Nation which,
like the United States, possesses the great
eat power and facilities for producing and
manufacturing things which the world
demands, is not destined to monoDO
hze the markets of the globe. With the
most favorable conditions for varied and
successful agriculture and the lightest
burden of National taxation, what coun
try, he asks, can compete with this in
developing the best resources of human
toil with a minimum of human effort.
With our wonderful labor-saving con
trivances applied to nearly every avenue
of production the wages paia in the
United States, in tie production of wheat
and cotton, for instance, are 50 to 100 per
cent higher than in countries with which
we compete, so the wages paid in manu
factures from metal aie from 25 to 100
per cent higher than the wages paid
workers in the same industries by other
nations.
And in this contest for feeding and
furnishing mankind â noting the fierce
competition which it meets all over the
globe â American agriculture, manufac
ture and commerce are steadily gaining
more trade, and this is furnishing an en
larged wage fund on a gold basis, out of
which seven millions of American labor
ers and skilled artisans draw their yearly
remuneration and upon which they and
their families largely depend for employ
ment and comfort.
DEATH OF GEORGE W. FERRIS.
Was the Inventor of the Great Wheel at
the World's Fair Which Made a
Fortune for Him.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Nov. 22.â George W.
Ferris, inventor and builder of the Ferns
wheel, died to-day at Mercy Hospital,
where he had been treated for typhoid
fever for a week. The disease is said to
have been brought on through worry over
numerous business matters. He leaves a
widow in this city.
Mr. Ferris was born at Galesbur?, 111.,
lived his early Jife on the Pacific Slope
and was educated at Carson City and San
Francisco. In 1876 he entered the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, N. V.,
and graduated wita high honors as an en
gineer.
He first worked at locating coal mines
and railroads in West Virginia, and was
then employed by the Louisville Bridge
Company at Louisville. Iri the capacity
of inspector he came to Pittsbure to in
spect the structural works for the Louis
ville and Nashville railroad bridge at
Henderson.
After the completion of this work he
was engaged as an inventor on his own
account. He organized the firm of G. W.
Ferris <fc Co. In 1893 Ferris conceived the
wheel which made hjm famous and which
was one of the particular features of the
World's Fair at Chicago. The wheel was
constructed in Pittsburg, under the super
vision of the inventor, and shipped to
Chicago, where he watched the erection
of it. Its capacity was 1400 passengers,
and thousands made the revolution in it.
The wheel made a fortune for Ferris and
gave him fame as an engineer all over ihe
world.
When the fair closed the wheel was
erected in a North Side park in Chicago,
where it now is. Mr. Ferris nad, however,
disposed of his interest in it. i . r

CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 22.â A special
from Topeka. Kans., says: The officers of
a Topeka charitable institution yesterday
made the remarkable statement that there
are over 400 deserted wives in this city,

for work or solicit funds with which to
buy bread for themselves and help their

The charitable society which bas made
the investigation that reveaied these facts
attributes it to the hard times and the gen

complaints which give timely notice of
their visitation, rheumatism is the most in-
sidious. It steals upon its victim with the
subtlety of a robber, not only rendering
him helpless, but inflicting the most in-
sufferable agony. " Nothing in the realm
of drugs or medicines has been found to
cure it, but it is now an established fact
that electricity gives instant ' relief and
quickly, entirely eradicates the disease
from the body. Dr. Sanden's improved
Electric Belts are made to meet every pos-
sible case of this terrible disease, and we
have many thousands of grateful people
cured in this city and neighborhood who
testify to what we claim. This belt is a
complete battery, so simple a child can

WILLIAM GOES TO
KIEL TO TALK
After Swearing In Recruits
He Will Speak About
Army Scandals.
The Emperor Is Also Anxious
to Control Interpellation De
bates in the Reichstag.
Opposition to the Proposed Increase
In the Naval Budget May Cause
the Chamber to Be Dissolved.
[Copyrighted, 1896, by the United Associated
Presses.]
BERLIN, Germany, Nov. 22.- Emperor
William will go to Kiel to-morrow for the
purpose of swearing in the recruits col- i
lected at that place, and there is a con- '
siderable degree of expectation that his j
Majesty will in the course of his address
to the recruits make some reference to thn
recent incidents impeaching the conduct
of military officers and privates toward
civiliaps. It is probable, however, that
the Kaiser will merely confine himself to
a repetition of the old formulas of exact
ing allegiance to himself.
In military circles the story published
in the Berliner Tageblatt implying that
the address of the Emperor to the officers
immediately surrounding him on the oc
casion of the swearing in of the troops in
Berlin was not what it purported to be is
generally discredited. The Tageblatt'sob
ject plainly was to lead its readers to
believe that the Em.peror, while pretend
ing to admonish the officers against the ;
recurrence of the recently reported out- I
rages upon civilians by officers, really gave ;
them to understand that any insult to i
their uniforms on the part of the civilians '
should be promptly and effectively re- j
sented. This, however, is denied, by sev- j
eral of the officers present, who say that'
the Kaiser simply advised them to avoid I
collisions with civilians.
The audacity of the Radical and So
cialist speeches in the Reichstag, es
pecially those delivered during the course
of the Brusewitz debate by Herr Lenz
mann and Bebel, have greatly incensed
the Emperor and Government officials
generally, who hold that Baroc yon Buol-
Berenberg, president of the Reichstag,
ought to have restrained the opposition
from using language possibly offensive to
the Emperor and his Ministers.
It is reported that the Emperor, on the
eve of his departure for Kiel, had* a pro
tracted conference with Prince Hohen
lohe, the Imperial Chancellor, in regard
to the position of the various parties in
the Reichstag with a view of establishing
a better control of interpellation debates.
The political party of the Center in the
Reichstag, through the conesion of its
members and the masterful tact of its
leaders, dominates the chamber and can
always, without directly attacking the I
Government, greatly embarrass the Minis- i
try. The Conservatives and National j
Liberals, although willing supporters of j
tbe Government, are greatly at a disad
vantage in lacking the leadership of the
Centrists.
The Cologne Gazette, in an article point- !
ing out the danger of allowing the Reichs- !
tag to submit to the masterly tactics of '
the Centrist leaders, appeals to the Con- i
servatiyes and National Liberals to sink
their differences upon agrarian and other
questions and rally to the support of the
Government, which has already been twice
assailed within the first fortnight of the j
present session, through tl^e machinations
of tbe Centrists, upon the questions of I
the Bismarck revelations and the practice
of dueling in the army. In connection
with the latter question a commission of
officers has been appointed to submit a re
port on the regulations of military courts
of honor, the commission having held
their meetings since the delivery of Prince
Hohenlohe's speech in reply to the radical
interpellation on Tuesday.
The Emperor has asked the committee
to expedite its report, and has sent to
that body a draft of suggestions, which, it
is understood, embodies a recognition of
the principle laid down by the Prince Re
gent of Bavaria, who has decreed that
hereafter officers refusing to fight duels
upon the ground that they are opposed to
â the principle of dueling must not be com
pelled to resign from the army, as has
hitherto been the rule. The leaders of the
Radical faction in tbe Reichstag are
watching the development of the matter,
and as a result have reached the conclu
sion .that ''nstructions oi the Prince Regent
will not become strictly operative in any
corps of the army of Germany, holding
that any officer declining to fight a duel,
though" he may not be formally expelled,
will become a social outcast.
Herr Richter, Radical Unionist leader,
has announced that upon the occasion of
the ofebate on the military estimates he
will again bring up the question of duel
ing by moving that any military
who shall enpa.ee in a duel shall be de
prived of his rank and expelled from tbe
service, and that officers' courts of honor
shall be abolished.
General yon Waldersee, now in com
mand of the army corps at Hamburg, has
been appointed military governor of Ber
lin in place of General yon Loe, whose
term of service is expiring.
Dr. Koch.governor of the Reichsbank,
has submitted to an interview upon the
question as to how the trade of Germany
is to be affected by the election of McKin
ley as President of the United State?. In
answer to this specific question Dr. Koch
said: "We must wait and see. At all
events McKinley is a lesser evil than
Bryan. lam hopeful that McKinley has
abandoned his policy of extreme protec
tion, but we are not secure from surprises
and we ought to be prepared for them.
It is to our interest that German trade
should stand well in America and we are
ready to give or take."
The keynote of the arrangements of the
Porte with a view of preserving the status
quo of Turkey proves to be the financial
plans of the directors of the Ottoman
Bank. Each power acting in the nominal
concert of powers is doubtless playing its
own game, but for the present the ques
tion of obtaining fresh supplies of money
rules the decisions of the Sultan.
Sir Edgar Vincent, governor of the Im
perial Ottoman Bank, was in Berlin prior
to his going to Vienna for the purpose of
conferring with the members of the
Vienna syndicate, and while here he saw
reports of the leading German financiers,
to whom he proposed tbe raisins of a
Turkish 3 per cent loan upon the conver
sion of the old debts and tbe general guar
antee of the powers, proposing another
scheme for the reform of the Turkish
debt commission by the appointment of a
Russian delegate thereto. Since then Nel
lidorf, Russian Embassador to Turkey,
has arrived in St Peters burg, and Sir Edgar
Vincent has learned that the Czar is un
certain about the appointment of a Rus
sian delegate upon tbe lurkish debt com
mission, the claims of Russia upon the
finances of Turkey being superior to all
other considerations. The sum of the
matter is that Russia only blocks the way
of the powers in dealing with the Porte.
A section of the Centrist party in the
Reichstag, chiefly composed of members
from t ho southern States, have decided to ,
oppose the proposed increase of 40,000,000 |
marks in the naval credit in the budget
and are arranging a coalition with a fac
tion of the National Liberals and the Rad
icals and Socialists for the purpose of de
feating the proposal. This movement
renders the passage of the naval increase
clause of the budget highly improbable.
Ministerial reports in circulation in the
lobby of the Reichstag agree that the
Kaiser is determined to dissolve the,
Chambers if the increase is not granted,
and t is being the ca3e a hot tight over
the naval increase seems inevitable.
A strike of tbe dockmen which began at
Hamburg yesterday is limited to 3800
men, but the lighter-men and other labor
ers threaten to join the strike to-morrow.
The strikers do no: enjoy the sympathy
of the public.
The fifty-sixth birthday of ex-Empress
Frederick was celebrated yesterday by a
family banquet at tbe New Palace, gala
performances at the .falace Theater and a
supper in the marble saloon at which the
Ministers and foreign Erabassadors and
their wives were present. All of the public
buildings were deborated with nags in
honor of the occasion. Under the assent
of tbe British Government, the German
War Office is about' to send Captain Norgen
to Dongola to witness the operations of
the Anglo-Egyptian campaign up the
Valley of the Nile.
The leaders of the Bohemian sugar in
dustries hare influenced the Austrian
Government to open communications with
the Berlin Government to induce the latter
to join in negotiations looking to a limita
tion of the international output of sugar.
The smaller beet-growers of Saxony and
Anhalt have become alarmed at the
increased operations of the sugar ring, and
have had several meetings, as a result of
which they have decided to ask that
Government that measures be taken to
restrict the power of the ring. Herr Ahl
wardt, the notorious Jewbaiter, who has
been conducting an unsuccessful anti-
Jewish campaign in America, is expected
to arrive in .Berlin in December.
Chapman Coleman, formerly first secre

WEYLER SAYS HE CAN YET WIN.
Be lieves the Insurgents Cannot Withstand
the Campaign He Claims to
Be Preparing.
HAVANA, Ccba, Nov. 2Lâ After a
somewhat lengthy silence Captain-General
Weyler has at last been heard from, and
in an interview he expressed himself as
being confident of putting an end to the
insurrection. General Weyler was inter
viewed in the Jaca camp, which is located
near the town of San Cristobal, province
of Pinar del Rio. He said, after declaring
that he was satisfied with the operations
that have been carried on up to the pres
ent time, that he believed the insurgents
did not have in the hills supplies sumcient
to last them for more than three engage
ments. After these engagements had oc
curred it would be easier to estimate the
resources of the rebels, but he believed
that it would then be lound that the am
munition of the insurgents was exhausted.
He added that he had still hfteen or
twenty days' work to perform at the camp
to complete his preparations for an ad
vance on the rebels, but that he would
wait uutil after Christmas before he moved
his troops forward. Then he would strike
a mortal blow at the insurgents.
When questioned concerning the posi
tion of Maceo, the rebel leader, General
Weyler, answered: "The last news I re
ceived about him located him south of the
Western Railway, on which San Cristobal
is located. He is unwilling to meet our
columns even when hia forces are in good
positions. W T o will see."
This indicates that so far the results of
the campaign of General Weyler are still
in the future. Maceo is apparently follow
ing his old tactics of drawing the Spanish
troops asfar.as possible into the hills from
their base of supplies, when, by dividing
his forces into small commands, he will be
able to continually harass them with
guerrilla tactics, for which they have no
liking.
Some distance to the west of San Cristo
bal are mountain passes where a com
paratively few rebels would be able to
nold tneir own against any force that
Spain could send against them and it is
thought that General Weyler will not
meet the elusive Maceo until he comes
upon him unexpectedly in some of these
mountain fastnesses.
The Epoca, a semi-official organ, admits
that it is possible that General Weyler
will return to Havana, owing to the un
healtiiv season.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 22.â A dispatch to
the Standard from Madrid says the Gov
ernment has intimated to General Weyler
that for reasons of international and do
mestic politics it will not be expedient for
for him to return to Havana until he has
achieved a decisive victory over Maceo.

PREFERMENT FOR
BISHOP KEANE
Pope Leo Urges the Aged
Prelate to Visit
Rome.
Belief in Church Circles That
He Is to Be Created
a Cardinal.
He Departs From San Jose on a Pil
grimage to the Holy
City.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 22.â Bishop John
J. Keane, late rector of the Catholic Uni
versity at Washington, left this city yes-
BISHOP JOHN J. KEANE.
The late rector of the Catholic University at Washington has been summoned
to Rome. It is believed that upon his arrival at the Holy City he will be promoted to
some position of eminence in recognition of his services to the church.
terday afternoon for Rome. This move of
the eminent theologian and educator is
due to a pressure that has been brought to
bear upon him in that direction ever since
he was relieved of his charge as rector of
the university. At that time, now over
two months ago, he was requested by the
Pope to go to Rome, but as he needed rest
and an opportunity for deliberation over
the situation he preferred rather to come
to San Jose, where he sought and found
needed rest and seclusion in the O'Connor
Sanitarium.
Every indication points to the prefer
ment of Bishop Keane after his arrival at
Rome. All the high officials in the church,
in America and at Rome, have expressed
the highest regard for him, an I on ail
sides there have been warm expressions of
a desire for his elevation into some posi
tion of eminence fitting his ability and
services to the church.
During bis stay in San Jose Bishop
Keane was not idle, although he did not
leave the confines of the sanitarium and
its grounds. Every Sunday evening he
conducted the services at the sanitarium
chnpel, and his loss will be greatly felt I
there on that account and on account of
tne fact that he took a kindly interest in
even the most humble of the sick and
afflicted and often visited and comforted
them.
Before leaving the sanitarium yester
day, Bishop Keane expressed much regret
to the sisters, to Father H. Gallagher and
to other friends. He said that his greatest
solace at being deprived of his position at
the head of an institution upon which he
bad set his heart, was the opportunity
that it gave him for a stay at so delightful
an institution as tbe sanitarium, and in a
city that had so pleasant a winter climate
as San Jose.
During his stay in San Jose, Bishop
Keane was debating as to the best
course for hi m to pursue in regard to the
invitation to go to Rome. There was
never any peremptory demand upom him
in that direction, so that he could not in
jure by the delay any chances that he
migh( have for preferment. He had much
interest before making a move in learning
the wishes of the board of directors of the
Catholic University of Washington, which
met recently. Cardinal Gibbons was
president of the board, and a warm per
sonal friend of Bishop Keane was ap
pointed his successor as rector, which
proved that he still had a potent influence
over that body. The appointment was
the most satisfactory possible to Bishop
Keane, who still feels and expresses as
great an interest in the welfare of the uni
versity as when he was at its head.
At a meeting of the board of directors of
the university by a unanimous request
Cardinal Gibbons sent a letter to the late
rector expressing the hope and belief that
his ability and eminent services would
soon be rewarded by his elevation to some
important station by the Holy Father at
Rome. The following significant senti
ments are contained in the letter of Car
dinal Gibbons. In reference to the posi
tion of Bishop Keane he says:
"Your noble soul has grown from your
undertaking. You have proven the effi
ciency of the university to train young
men to generous self-forgetfulness for the
welfare of others in your sublime resigna
tion to the will of the Holy Father. You
are the masterpiece of your own training."
Tne letter of Cardinal Gibbons and the
reply of Bishop Keane have already been
published. Private advices were also re
ceived by him from almost every Cardi
nal, Archbisbop and other high official in
the church both in America and Europe.
All urged him to go to Home, and pre
dicted that he would certainly be received
there with distinction and be given prefer
ment.
The action of the board of directors of
the university was very encouraging to
Bishop Keane, and after that meeting he
awaited only the return of Archbishop
Riordan ol San Francisco, who was in at
tendance at the meeting and was elected
one of the board of directors of the uni
versity. Archbishop Riordan returned to
San Francisco last week ana Bishop
Keane went up from San Jose and had a
conference with him.
On Thursday last Bishop Keane re
turned to this city with his mind defi
nitely determined as to what his course
should be. He told a number of his
friends that he would proceed to Rome
immediately, by the advice of Archbishop
Riordan. The latter during his visit in
the East had conferred with Cardinal Gib
bons and a number of Archbishops, and
they all agreed in urging Bishop Keane to
proceed at once to Rome. It was believed
, that such a course would be in a line of
speedier preferment than if he retired
here and awaited the action of the author
ities at Rome.
This belief is strengthened by some sen
timents in a fetter that has just been re
ceived by Archbishop Ireland from Cardi
nal Satolli at Rome. The letter gives
assurances that "there is a bright future
in reserve for Bishop Keane, the rector of
the university."
It is believed that nothing definite is
known or has been intimated from Rome
as to what special honors are to be con
ferred upon Bishop Keane, but his friends
in America are confident that he will be
made a Cardinal. Even before his retire
ment as head of the university a number
of his influential friends predicted that he
would some day leave that work to assume
a red hat. At present there is no vacancy
in America and no regular appointment
as a Cardinal can be made. It is recog
nized that Bishop Keane is one of the best
informed men in America as to the needs
and condition of the church here, and it
has been suggested that he might be ap-
I pointed a Cardinal for America with a
j residence in Rome.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 22. â A
party of a dozen young people who left
Ensley City last night in a wagon for a
pleasure ride had their merriment trans
ferred into death and disaster before they
had proceeded a mile on their journey.
Ten days ago a new bridge wai completed
across Village Creek, near Ensley City.
While crossing this structure it gave way,
precipitating the wagon fifteen feet below
into the water. Not a person in tne
vehicle escaped uninjured.
William Shannon, aged 20, was hurt
about the head, which caused concussion
of the brain, from which he died to-day.
I . Miss Maggie Hartigan was seriously in
jured about the head and her back was
sprained. It is feared she will die.
Charles Barnes had bis scalp cut open
and received internal injuries which may
result seriously. Tne other injured are :
C. I. Shannon, head badly cut; G. G.
Campbell, bruised about-face and body;
Ed Blackburn, arm broken; Sam ; Brown,
let; and head cut; Miss Ella Jones, cut
and bruised in bead and shoulders; Miss
Lula Williams, bruised; Miss Annie Wil
liams, face badly out; Miss. Nellie Black
burn, bruised; Eph Bowie, driver, back
sprained. Â . . , >-
The cause of the accident was that the
stringers of the bridge were too short and
gradually .worked off the sills. . The jar of
the wagon last night caused them to fall,
letting the entire span down. ;..

THEIR GRIDIRON
ON A HILLSIDE
Stanford's Men Training
Hard at Congress
Springs.
Marvelous Appetites Daveloped
by Exercising Near the
Clouds.
How tbe Day Is Spent by the
Members of the Varsity
Eeven.
CONGRESS SPRINGS, Cal., Nov. 22.â
The proprietor of the hotel here, on the
arrival of the Stanford men, said that he
had heard of the enormous appetites of
football players and had fortified his
larder against any onslaught the Palo Al
toans might make, but from the way in
which his provisions are disappearing he
has come to the conclusion that he knows
nothing about the game and the appetite
it develops. At the first meal the players
ate everything in sight and loudly called
for more, much to the host's astonish
ment.
For practice the men go down onto a
field near the hotel. It is a mighty poor
held, however, having a decided slope
which greatly handicaps the team that
has to work uphill. The field is even
poorer than that at Woodside, but the
other accommodations are so much supe
rior to those the men have enjoyed in
former years that they all are positive
they will never care to train at Woodside
again.
Each two men have a nicely furnished
room to themselves and the bathing facili
ties are good, but the men are not allowed
to drink any of the mineral water for fear
it will do them more harm than good â
that is the opinion of the trainer.
Talk about a bracing atmosphere I It is
simply indescribable up here. The eleva
tion of the springs is about 1000 feet. The
place is a good distance from centers of
civilization. Los Gatos is six miles away;
San Jose twice as far distant and the uni
versity is twenty miles from here. The
men spend their evenings in the large sit
ting-room, where they gather around a
big blazing hearth, sing college songs and
talk football. A few of the more studious
ones retire early to their rooms, where
they "diE" as hard at their books as
though they were expecting an "ex" the
following day.
Practice begins with running down the
field of second eleven men, and giving
some tacklers on the first eleven a chance
to mend their faults. After this the
teams line up for a half hour or so. On
account of the absence of Murphy and
Cotton the first afternoon Mclntosh and
Freeman were put in at quarterback and
fullback on the Varsity. Both of these
men put up a strong game. Freeman's
line-bucking was good, while Mclntosh's >
passing was very sure, considering that
the ball was wet and the ground in such
poor condition. Harrington, left tackle,
was the only man who failed to put up an
excellent game, and he was put over on
tbe second eleven, Rice taking his place.
The latter played harder than he has at
any previous game of the season. Jeffs
and Straight played admirably at ends.
Both tackled hard and low and easily
broke up the interference of the second
team.
Signal practice occupies considerable
time each morning and a practice game of
an hour occurs in the afternoon.
GIVEN NORTH YAKIMA LANDS.
Settler Proves Title to a Homestead
Including Eighty Acres in
the City.
TACOMA, Wabh., Nov. 22.â News has
been received in North Yakima that the
Secretary of the Interior has decided in
favor of the applicant in a land case pend
ing since 189 L The result of the decision
is that sso,ooo worth of property, including
eighty acres just outside the city limits,
and eighty acres in the most thickly set
tled portion of the city, including dozens
of houses and residence lots, passes into
the hands of the applicant, J. H. Need
bam. Tbe land and lots were sold by the
Northern Pacific to the present holders,
but the decision of tbe Secretary implies
that the railroad had no title.
Captain MacCrimmon in 1884 made ap
plication at the local land office to file a
timber-culture claim on the land in ques
tion. This was two years before tbe pres
ent city existed. His application was
rejected, but in 1891 his partner Needham
filed a homestead on the same tract, hold
ing that by reason of MacCrimmon's
timber-culture claim pending before the
Land Office in 1884, when the Northern
Pacings rights attached, the tract was ex
empted from grant.
His homestead application was rejected,
and he appealed. A telegram received by
his attorney gives him the prior right of
filing a homestead. The owners of the
property will look to the railroad com
pany ior repayment of money paid on
lands.
AT THE NAVAL STATION.
Gunboat Bennmgton Enters the Drydock
for Repairs â Work on the
Ships of War.
VALLEJO, Cal., Nov. 22.â The gunboat
Bennington came up to the island on
Thursday and at once went into drydock.
It was scraped and on Tuesday it is ex
pected the little ship will be on the way to
San Francisco. The Petrel is nearly ready
for sea and will, about the middle of De
cember, leave for China.
A force of over 1100 men is employed at
the yard. But little work was required on
the Philadelphia, which will be sent to
South America in a week or so. Thanks
giving day will be observed as a holiday
and the various messes at the barracks
and on the Independence will eat turkey
on that day.
One day last week the men on the Inde
pendence treated themselves to a dish ot
sauerkraut and frankfurters. It required
200 pounas of tbe kraut and 150 pounds of
the sausage for one meal for the 250 men
on the Independence.
Congressman Hilborn visited the yard
last week and be will use bis best enaeav
ors at the coming session of Congress to
secure an appropriation for a new wooden
drydock. There are a number of ships at
the yard requiring docking, bat each will
have to take its turn.
The Press Association of California will
visit the yard on Tuesday and make a
thorough inspection of all departments.
OAKLAND CHILIPS JOURNEY
Boarda the Wrong Train at the Mole and
Is Carried ,to Fresno.
FRESNO, CaiÂ», Nov. 22.â Among the
passengers who arrived on the 5:20 train
from the north this evening was a five
year-old boy who cheated the Southern
Pacific out of a half* fare from Oakland to
Fresno, and will enjoy a lide back in the
morning, also free of cost. The little fel
low's name is Frank Gould and his parents
reside at the St. Vincent Hotel on Twelfth
avenue in East Oakland. He says his
father is a mining speculator.
It appears that the boy and his mother
were returning from a "visit to San Fran
cisco and at the pier they became sepa
rated.
She boarded the train for her home,
while tbe youngster boarded the train for
the South. His presence on the train was
not discovered by the conductor until La
throp was reached. The little fellow is
unusally bright, and the trainman easily
learned the stale of affairs. He took the
boy to the end of his run, and will send
him back on the morning train. The par
ents of the boy were immediately notified
by the conductor of the whereabouts of
their son. The youngster won the heart
oi Conductor Dolan, and this evening he
entertained the people about the Hughes
Hotel in this city with his bright sayings
and amusingly descriptive account of his
trip.

FRESNO PRIEST INSTALLED.
Father O'Reilly, Formerly of Bakers-
field, Enters a Aew FWd.
FRESNO, Cal., Nov. 22.â Rev. Father
O'Reilly, formerly of Bakersfield, was
formally installed as priest of the parish
in this city by Bishop Montgomery this
morning. The church was crowded to
the doors during the services. Father
Garriga, who has had charge in this city
for several years past, has been trans
ferred to Father O'Reilly's place in Bakers
field. There is some friction over the
exchange of parishes ordered by Bishop
Montgomery, and Father Garriga refuses
to leave Fresno. Bishop Montgomery's
mission to the city is also to settle this
difficulty.
Held at Pendleton for Blackmail.
PENDLETON, Ob.. Nov. 22.â During a
preliminary examination of Ed Gould of
San Francisco, who is accused of attempt
ing to extort money from Mrs. W. E. Wat
son, J. H. Brown was yesterday intro
duced as a witness and testified that he
heard a man named Lot. with Gould,
scheming to make Mrs. Watson pay $50
as hush money. Gould was held to await
the action of the Grand Jary, and is in
jail, being unable to secure bonds in the
sum of $300. Gould is said to be a son of
the late A. L. Gould, who was connected
with the defunct Alta-California news
paper at San Francisco under the Fred
MacCrellish management, who com
mitted suicide in Sacramento several
years ago.
Salt of a Cherokee J/irte.
OROVILLE, Cal,, Nov. 22.â The Spring
Valley hydraulic mine at Cherokee was
sold yesterday by Receiver J. 8.. Whit
comb to Attorney T. Z. Blakeman of San
Francisco, for the bondholders, for $275,
-000. This property consists of several
hundred acres of mining ground and
dumping ground, as well as many miles
of water ditches. It has been in litigation
for several years. Other parties to the
suit have six months in which to redeem
it. Unless this is done, it is reported, the
bondholders will prepare to open the mine
by drifting, and will employ several hun
dred men.
Some of the pavement in use on the
streets of Vienna is composed of granulated
cork mixed with asphalt and other cohe
sive substances. It is compressed into
blocks of convenient size. Its advantages
are cleanliness, noiselessness, durability
and economy.

Narrow Escape of Hotel
Lodgers From Death
in a Torrent.
The Building They Occupied
Carried Away by High
Water.
Half-Clad Inmates Rush Out Just
a Moment Before tbe
Crash.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 22.â During the
flood on Thursday the lodging-house of
Cleveland & Klein on the Sauk River in
the Monte Cnsto mining district, Wash
ington, was swept away. Just before it
went tbe lodgers, twelve in number, were
hastily routed out of their beds by Jacob
Klein and told to flee for their lives. The
building was a large one, abont 35x80,
three stories and basement. It had been
well finished and furnished only recently,
and was to be opened as a hotel in a day
or two more.
As the lodgers rushed into tbe barroom
an immense larch tree came down Glacier
Creek at a terrible rate, tore through the
Monte Cristo concentrator's high railroad
trestle, taking out three bents, next
through the switchback trestle, taking out
three more bents, then through the rail
road main line bridge, Knocking out four
bents, and the mass of wreckage bore down
â¢wun fearful force into Sauk River- and
headed straight for the Cleveland & Klein
building.
"Run, boys," yelled Klein, and as the
great building swung around at right
angles to the stream and tbe south side
tilted up into tne air the men leaped for
their lives and fell in a heap in front of
the fish market and scrambled through
the water to land.
The building toppled entirely over, and
its immense mass dammed SÂ»uk River
long enough to raise the fish market bodily
from its foundation, and as the hotel was
torn and rent to splinters, and the river
channel cleared, the smaller building was
swept down the canyon aud was torn to
pieces.
About the same time an avalanche of
soft mud and slush came down from the
Sauk lode mining claim, and this, with
tbe mass of wreckage from the bridges
6 nd buildings, dammed Sauk River, wnich
cut a new channel through Douglas ave
nue. Tbe residents of Monte Cristo were
compelled to flee and that quickly. The
river cut throush the railroad embank
ment below tbe switchback, and took
down tbe north side of the track and cut
it a second time, r-turning to its old chan
nel a short distance above tbe railroad
bridge, which, being of strontrly driven
piles, withstood the strain, and is still
intact. Abont 200 feet of the embankment
went out.
* Nine miners are reported missing, but
.it is believed that they made their way
â  ' . along the hillsides to Silverton. However,
. nothibg has yet been heard from any of
them.
DESTRUCTION OF HAMILTON.
The Washington Town Almost Complete/)
Swept Away by the Flood of
Last Week.
SEATTLE. Wash., Nov. 22.â A {Mount
Vernon special concerning the damage by
flood to tbe town of Hamilton, Skagit
County, says: Tbe town is a complete
wreck. The big brick store building of
Barker & Fontaine is a beap of ruins,
and goods are buried under fallen walls.
Streets are washed out, sidewalks gone
and the town is filled with trees, stumps
and rubbish. Every one is discouraged
and heartbroken.
Water invaded every bouse in the lowei
part of town, and some people were pris
oners upstairs until Sunday noon, when
they were taken off in boats.
The track of the Seattle and Northern
Railway between Woolley and Hamilton
has been almost completely destroyed,
and it will probably be two weeks before
tbe road is in good working condition
again. Tbe mail is now being taken on a
handcar from Whitney Station.
The loss to up-river ranchers will be
heavy, as considerable stock was lost. No
precautions against flood had been taken
at Hamilton, as the river never caused
trouble tnere before. Tbe river was sev
eral feet higher than it was ever known to
bave been before.
GREAT NORTBEEN CLEAR.
Tie*- President Sill Say the Line It
Heady fnr Overland Train*.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 22â "We will
have our line ready for overland travel
Tuesday," said Samuel Hill, vice-presi
dent of the Great Northern to-night at
tbe Butler Hotel when asked whÂ«n that
portion of the main line whicli has been
tied up by washouts in the Cascade
Mountains since a week ago last Friday
would be in operation again. Chief En
gineer Stevens accompanied Hill west.
They came over the Great Northern to
Skykomish, there crossed the river in a
rowboat and thence to Seattle on a work
train.
According to Mr. Hill the most serious
trouble with which the road is now con
fronted in resuming traffic is in construct
ing a bridge over Skykomish River,
and this he believes will be completed
by Tuesday.
"This has been tne most destructive
storm to all property-owners from the
Rocky Mountains west to the coast that
baa occurred since 1844," the Great North
ern vice-president resumed. "As to
bridge washouts, both railroad and pub
lic, they have been occasioned more by
reason of persons throwing trees, logs and
wood into the river than by high water.
Hill was attired in a storm suit and
bore unmistakable evidence of having
taken a very active part in superintending
Ibe work of repair along the line of tbe
Great Northern from the Rockien to the
coast.

SANTA BARBARA
Like a Vision of the Past
Seems the Seaside
Town.
Lile Within Its Precincts but a
Glimpse of the Poet's
Dreamland
Visitors Attracted by the Gray Old
Mission, With Walls Moss-
Covered.
Where falls not hall or rÂ»in, or any snow,
Nor ever wind blows loudly, boi It lies
Deep meadowed happy, fair with orchard lawns

SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Nov. 13.â
Santa Barbara is such a land as the good
King Arthur hoped to find when he was
borne away to the island valley of Avalon
in order to get healed of his grievous
wound.
If the lotus eaters had found it they
would have been willing to forget the past
and live on without regret in a land "in
which it seemed always afternoon."
The charm of Santa Barbara has been
its repose. Quiet has brooded over the
little valley lying between the mountains
and the sea time out of mind.
Other towns might get impatient and be
in a hurry, out Santa Barbara never.
Nature set the pace for the people. The
unchanging aspect of the mountains sug
gested repose. The calm sea, with its
ebbing and flowing tides, taught man the
lesson of ceaseless activity, without worry
or excitement.
The coming and going of the peerless
days without extremes of weather showed
that man's life could run calmly like a
deep river to the sea. Men have taken all
this to heart and it must be a stormy na
ture indeed which is not subdued by such
an environment.
As a consequence theie is no other town |
in the republic which is so wise in its lei
sure or so unhurrying in its business. Life '
seems a perpetual holiday. Always there
are picnics on the beach at sunset or by
moonlight, or horseback and coaching
parties coming and going, or the best of
music at tbe Sea Plaza or at the Arlington.
IJEverywhere there is gay laughter and
music and tbe babble of merry Toices.
This holiday making comes mainly
from two causes: first, there is a large
class of residents who have retired from
business and have much leisure un their
hands; and second, the surroundings of
the town ana its perfect climate invite the
people to an out-of-door life.
The. mountains with their many green
canyons, are on one side of the town, and
the eea upon the other, and these afford
unfailing pleasure.
Business and protessional men make a
practice each year of leaving the cares of
their shops and offices behind them and
bfmkmg themselves to pleasant camps in
the mountains and canyona. It is rare,
indeed, to find a family which has not
spent at least a fortnight in camp.
All this shows that the Barbareno has
caught on to the secret of wiÂ»e living. To
restor play is man's normal condition.
To work is a forced and unnatural condi
tion, ami therefore too much work brings
inevitable harm in either eiving a
cramped nature or a diseased body
But the Barbareno does not shirk his
work. He simply does it wisely. Neither
uo I mean to infer that no business is
done in the town, for there is a very brisk
trade carried on, and stores of all kinds
show tine stocks of goods and evidently
are doing well. Iv fact, there is no other
town of 7000 people in any part of the
country showing greater signs of prosper
ity in its trade during these hard times
than Santa Barbara.
This is in part due to the fact that a
large number of the people derive their
incomes from their old homes. These in
comes are liberally spent, and of course
get into quick circulation among all
classes. Then, too, walnuts, lemons, pe
troleum, asphaltum, olive oil, wool, horses,
sheep and cattle, grain, beans and dairy
producta brine in steadily large amounts
of money which are fairly distributed
among the whole population. As a conse
quence there is no lack of money and
trade is good.
Neither do I mean to imply that the
people think so much of leisure and re
pose that they have failed to do the amount
oi work necessary to improve and beautify
the town. The place is thoroughly
equipped in the up-to-date style. Its
streets are graded and sidewalked'. Some
miles of paving are already laid. It is
perfectly lighted. Its streets are sprinkled
and sewers flushed with sea water. It has
an electric railroad and a splendid public
library. In short, as it had to be a modern
town, its people have made it the most
pleasant and comfortable place in the
State. One thing it lacksâ a bathhouseâ
but that lack will soon be supplied. The
Board of Trade has taken hold of the
matter, and soon a suitable bathing place
to cost $10,000 will be built.
If a visitor should ask me to point out
the most interesting thing in the town I
should at once call the Franciscan mis
sion that thing. It is a splendid build
ing â the finest monument of the sons of
Saint Francis now existing in the State.
When you see the gray friars working
among the vines and olives and jroing to
1 and fro upon their appointed daily
tasks upon tne time-stained pile, you can
easily imagine that you are in old Spain,
and the allusion will only be deepened
when one of the fathers addresses you in
the pure C.-wilian. The mission was
founded in 1786. It crowns a gentle slope
two miles from the sea. From its noble
i j corridor you can look upon as fair a scene
as nature evÂ«r spread before men's eyes,
made up of valleys and mountains, islands
and sea.
The next place of greatest interest is the
beach, it is skirted by a sea road, partly
paved for two miles. The road ends in a
plaza touched by high tide, and is such a
lo\ ely spot that crowds of saunterers are
always found enjoying its beauties.
At full moon, or when the long row of
electric lights are lit and the lull tide is
coming in from the mysterious spaces
beyond, it seems a place of enchant
ment.
Santa Barbara weather need not be
spoken of. It is as perfect as weather can
be. He who is not satisfied with it will
only rind his ideal in paradise. The town
is on the eve ol a marked advance in popu
lation. It only needs the completion of
the coast road â and this is a matter of
months â to send it forward with a bound
to a first-class position in a commercial
sense â a position it already occupies With
respect to health and pleasure?.

The Musical Temperament
Speaking to Bettina yon Arnim about
the influence upon bis mind of Goethe's
poetr.B, .Beethoven declar?d tnat they pow
erfully Impressed him b<j*h by their
rhythm and by their matter; "and," he
added. "I am moved to composition by
their language and by the lbftv spirit
of harmony pervading them." So
that what stirred in him the cre
aiive impulse, as he came under the
spell of a great poet, was the ecstasy born
of toe measured words and of their inner
senseâ their esthetic and spiritual rather
than their purely intellectual content.
And it was in this connection that be
affirmed music to be "the medium be
tween the spiritual and the sensuous life"
â a luminous and Â©regnant word which
sorts not ill with the view here presented,
and is, perhaps, as near an approach to a
â definition of the undefinable as is likely to
be compassed. â Blackwood's Magazine.

AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
Yesterday's Runs Postponed â Harry
Terrlll Not Seriously Hurt.
All of the bicycle runs scheduled for
yesterday had to ba postponed one week,
owing to the inclement weather. In con
sequence the different clubhouses were
cror/ded all day and evening, and natur
ally tbe principal topics, of discussion
were the many exciting events incident to
the opening mest of the Velodrome Satur
day.
Harry Terrill was at the Bay City Club
in the afternoon with his head all band
aged, but he is not suffering much from
the effects of his fail and expects to be able
to ride again at the meet Thanksgiving
day. The Terrill brothers gave the public
a sample of the grit for which they are
noted in the race in winch they were both
thrown. The fall was near the tat>e, and
all but two, Downiag and Becker, went
down.
These two finished, and tbe T-rrills. as
soon as they got tbeir senses, seemed to
realize simultaneously that there was a
third prize to be had, and at once jumped
up and started to drag their badly dam
aped wheels toward the tape. "Bob,''
who was the least injured, got there first,
and Harry gave up, falling into the arms
of two of his ciubmates who had rushed
toward him. thoroughly exhausted..
Decker of the Acme Club bad a narrow
escape from hitting the judges' stand
when he fell, and was lucky to escape
witu what few bruises he received.
Tbe riding of Kenna, the amateur
champion and a new acquisition to the
already long list of cracks carrying the
old gold and crimson of the Bay City
Whfe.'men, was the best seen here in
many a day, and ranks him as a star per
former. He would be formidable in the
professional class, but does not Care to
race for money, and is satisfied to remain
where be is.
Leitch of Sacramento did not appear at
this meet as a professional, notwithstand
ing the announcement of a morning
paper.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen Have lost
some good members recently. Harlow H.
White and Len D. Owens have resigned
from the club and cast their lots with the
new Olympic Gun Club, which has re
cently established an elegant clubhouse
on Van Ness avenue. John E. Edwards,
the professional racer, baa left the Olym
pic Wheelmen and gone to tne Imperial
Club. Dan E. Whitman, another "pro.,"
has joined the Garden City Cyclers.
D. E. Becker, the five-mile National
champion, has challenged "Bob" Terrili
to race for the Velodrome shield, which
the latter won Saturday. The event will
take place in two weeks.
If. iv Castle, a well-known wheelman of
New York, was a spectator at tbe races
Saturday, and pronounced tbe meet a big
success in his estimation, and the track
one of tne beat he has ever seen. He is
representing a patent headlight for bicy
cles, and will be here a fortnight.
The Thanksgiving day meet at tbe Velo
drome will have a good programme, but
it is being given by the management
against the sage advice of all the wheel
men prominent in local cycling affairs
and who have had lots of experience in
promoting race meets. They realize that
the intercollegiate football game and the
horseraces will draw so many people that
there will be but few of the sport-loving
puhlic left to attend bicycle races.
Harry li3rkin, .Â«ecretary of tne Bay CHy
Wheelmen, is in Fresno on business.
The Bay City Wheelmen's pool tourna
ment commences this evening.
McClish Favors Football.
Rev. Dr. Eli McClish, president of the
University of the Pacific, addressed a meeting
held in the Howard-street Methodist church
last night especially for Companies A and I of
the Boys' Brigade. He spoke encouragingly
of the value of the organization, and declared
that growing youth is full of animal spirits
that naturally seek an outlet in romping play,
in vigorous activity. He said that he favors
football and baseball, and all such manly
sports that permit of the full exercise of the
puysical power on a boy that goes to round
him out into a strong, manly, self-reliant man
familiar with his power and able to use and
to restrain it, because of the schooling of his
nerves and muscles in his athletic exercises.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Tlie Assessors' convention will be the
big thing this week.
If you have any ideas on tax reform
now is the time to put them in shape.
A Secretary of Mines and Mining would
be as great a help to the Cabinet as to the
miners.
Maceo is one Cuban that can't be
smoked out, and he is not made of poor
stuff either.
It keeps Mark Hanna busy these days
denying reported interviews. The fakers
are still after him.
There is no process of education on the
subject of home industries equal to that
of advertising them.
An extra session is better than a deficit
tariff. .Better have too much Congress
than too little revenue.
Remember, this is the season for charity
as weil as thanksgiving;, and make your
preparations accordingly.
If war break-; out with .Spain the first
duty of the Government will be to send
out a tugboat to guard the Texas.
It seems fair to assume that the deficit
has grown large enough by this time for
Cleveland to mention it in liis message.
There may be no effective way of pre
venting the advertisins of lotteries, but
the Legislature might try its hand at it.
â  The New Yorkers have noted that
. Moody drew bigger crowds than the
horse show, and they are trying to guess
why.
Every step taken in the movement for
tariff reform should be toward protection,
and there should be no compromise on
that principle.
The outlook for a re'orm tariff bill this
winter is so unpromising that we might
as well begin to count on an extra session
as a sure thing.
â¢ Election skeptics are bobbing up all
over the country and writing to the papers
that they have no more faith in recounts
than in first counts.
There is no land with such a profusion
of luxuries as California and none where
such a large proportion of the people can
nfford to enjoy them.
We shall never have Tom Watson in the
right place until we make him captain of
the Texas and give him the fellows who
constructed her as a crew.
If McKinley should rind the work of
Cabinet-making at all tiresome he has
only to cay so and lots of fellows will
volunteer to do the job for him.
Since Uncle Bam succeeded so well in
quieting the British and Venezuelan quar
rel he might soothe down the Spaniards
and Cubans a little if he would try hard.
Many a man who voted for Bryan i 3
now willing to admit he was mistaken in
b lieving it was necessary to give tne
country fits in order to cure it of hard
times.
The last Republican administration pro
moted the esiat)lii.hment of a steamship
line across the Atlantic, and the next one
will advance the eood work by promoting
one across the Pacific.
The Tennesseeans are rushing the build
ings of their interstate exposition, wiach
is to open next May, and expect to have
the first whack at the money the new era
of prosperity will circulate.
One of the notable featnres of the cam
paign has been the slaughtering of Demo
cratic leaders. Cleveland, Hill, Carlisle,
Gorman and Altgeld go down with Bryan,
and there seems no chance for the resur
rection of any of them.
North Carolina has to elect a United
States Senator this winter, and as the
Legislature on a joint ballot will have 53
Republicans, 57 Democrats and 60 Pop
ulists, it is evident somebody will have to
make fusion oat of confusion in order to
win.
From the drift of things in Indiana it
seems ex-President Harrison can return to
the Senate if he wishes, but the situation
in New York is such that if Cleveland
wishes an office after leaving the Presi
dency he will have to run for Sheriff again
and end where he began.
The astronomers of the Lowell Observ
atory who have been working at Flagstaff,
Arizona, announce that since August 1
they have discovered 150 new stellar sys
tems, so it seems the dry climate of that
country has its advantages. If you can't
raise cain you can see stars.
The Eastern States have had the largest
apple crop on record, but just as they were
counting on big profits from the European
market German officials interdicted the
sale in that country on the ground that
American dried apples are unhealthy, and
now in some parts of the East the farmer
is willing to tight the Kaiser on sight.
Mining men will not be the only appli
cants this winter for a representative in
the Cabinet, as Senator Frye has a bill be
fore his committee in the Senate provid
ing for the creation of a Department of
Commerce, and it might be a good thing
for the miners to join forces with the
merchants and acore a double victory.
THE PLEASURE OF APPRECIA
TION.
The desire of appreciation and the feel
ing of pleasure arising upon its honest
expression are among the most clearly de
fined attributes of the human mind. It
matters not in what pursuit, trade or call
ing a person is engaged, he will be found
as a rule earnestly seeking for the appre
ciation of somebody, and will respond in
an increase of effort when its presence is
made known.
The Call, under its present manage
ment, has devoted two years of service to
the people of California, with certain
definite objects in view. It has aimed to
be a daily newspaper representing and re
sponding to tbe healthiest thought of the
t:me. It has endeavored to carry into
effect methods of journalism which are
above reproach. It has honestly sought
to gain and to deserve the confidence of
its readers and patrons, and by this means
alone to achieve f-uccess. It has bad an
increasing consciousness that it possesses
this confidence and that tne success it
aimed for was being achieved.
It has be*n a pleasure indeed to find
that the effort of The Call in the direc
tion of clean and honorable journalism is
being met with proper and well-expressed
appreciation.
In Town Talk, one of the brightest and
best of our local weeklies, appeared last
week the article which The Call repro
duced upon its first page yesterday. Tbe
following excerpt from that article con
tains the very essence of The Call's
policy:
The real test of merit in a newspaper is what
it contains. Upon this point The Call is safe
from the effect of idle rumors and adverse
criticism. It gives the news. It speaks boldly
aud clearly udoii the issues of the day. It
treats discordant interests fairly. It black
mails nobody. It reflects the decency and
propriety of daily journalism.
The Call ia grateful for this clear and
unequivocal expression of appreciation on
the part of oar weekly contemporary. It
reflects, we beiieve, the sentiment* of tbis
community and of every other into the
homes of which The Call is going with
constant increases. The people of
California may rest assured that
the past course of The Call
which has evoked such words of apprecia
tion will be its future one, and that it will
continue to represent with increasing
earnestuess and force that element in our
society which believes in the decency and
honesty in journalism which is a
prerequisite to success in every other
department of thought and trade.
THE MAGNETIC EFFECT.
Araone the letters of congratulation
which President-elect McKinley has re
ceived from all parts of the country we
may be sure tnat none have pleased him
more than those which have come to nim
from men of business and of industry.
These have brought him the best assur
ance of the prosperity of his administra
tion by making it clear to him that his
election means the renewal of activity in
ail lines of trade and the prosperity of all
the people.
Among letters of this kind one of the
most notable is that from Henry Clews,
who, among other things, says: "The
magnetic effect of your election has al
ready advanced the price of securities
dealt in at the New York Stocr Excnange
over $100,000,000, and a corresponding
amount in the securities dealt in at the
different local markets throughout the
country."
Mr. Clews called attention to the facts
that when he wrote spot cash wheat had
advanced both in Chicago and New York
since the election 14 cents a bushel, rates
of interest on call money had fallen from
10 to 4 per cent, and mercantile paper
which before the election was unsalable
was then sought for at 5 per cent per an
num. This, as he points out, has resulted
in the employment of an increased amount
of labor, and he says: "Machinery that
â¢was heretofore idle by reason of the pro
longed bad times is starting up again with
renewed vipor in all directions."
That these statements are not exagger
ated is made evident by the news of open
ing mill? and reviving industry in all
parts of the Union. We have not felt the
new impulse so acutely in California as in
some other States where there is a greater
manufacturing industry and where the
depression was more disastrous, but even
here there are not lacking abundant evi
dences that we are about to enter upon an
era of industrial activity which will be
widely different from the condition which
his prevailed during the past three years.
Among the notable signs of activity in
our State are the prospects for increased
railway construction. The Valley road
is preparing for large extensions, the
Southern Pacific is getting ready to com
plete the coast line to Los Angeles, and
capital is coming forward to promote local
lines in various parts of ti e State. This
activity in railroad construction will stim
ulate activity in other lines of industry,
and before long we shall see a large degree
of general prosperity.
Taking all these things into considera
tion it will be seen that Mr. Clews used
the right phase in speaking of "the mag
netic effect" of McKinley's election. The
results have been hardly less than mag
netic in all parts of the Union, and there
is every reason to believe that these effects
will continue to increas* as wise legisla
tion takes the place of Democratic blun
dering when the McKinley administra
tion becomes a fact instead of a forecast.
THE END OF FUSION.
The trouble of the fusion managers has
not ended with the election. On the con
trary, never was the fusion in so much
confusion as at this time. The discord
affects the whole scheme from highest to
lowest, and is to be noted not only in
National politics, but even in the local
politics of the approachirr spring elec
tions.
The declaration of L. C. Bateman, who
was the Populist candidate for Governor
in Maine, published in The Call of
Thursday, has been followed by another
letter from Watson to Chairman Butter,
published yesterday. Both of these make
it clear that the middle-of-the-road Popu
lists will have nothing more to do with
Democracy, and reports from the cities in
California where spring elections are to be
held show that the local Democratic and
Populist managers are as antagonistic as
are their National leaders.
As Mr. Bateman said: '"Bryan and his
issue are done for." That expresses the
whole situation in a nutshell, and as there
is no longer any fusion issue, there is no
longer any possibility of lusion. To tne
National leaders the difficulty is merely
one of abstract politics, but to the local
leaders getting ready for spring election
ft is a much more perplexing problem.
They are not able to dispose of it by
simply writing letters on the subject, and
it would seem that nothing remains for
them but a complete abandonment of the
combination formed last summer.
This result was not unexpected. In
fact, it was foreseen from the beginning
by political experts, and foretold over and
over again. The l'opuists will go back
to tne middle of tiie road and resume their
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1896.
march toward the end they have long had
in view, while t:ie Democratic leaders wili
gather their nocks in the woods as best
they can. Fusion has at last reached its
inevitable end, and the result is confusion
worse confounded.
GENERAL MILES' REPORT.
In his annual report to the Secretary of
War, General Miles devotes considerable
space to the consideration of the question
of coast defense, and renews forcibly- all
the recommendations on that subject made
in former reports. He points out that the
appliances of war have undergone so great
a change within the last thirty years as to
make it imperative to alter the entire char
acter of our older fortifications and arma
ments.
In his estimates of work required to be
done the general treats the Pacific Coast
well. He recommends for San Diego $800,
-925, for Ban Francisco $902,850, for the
mouth of the Columbia River $566,325 and
for Puget Sound $764,050.
In addition to these recommendations
for coast defenses the general also urges
the importance of having on this side of
the Rocky Mountains a station suitable
for the accommodation of a regiment of
cavalry. He recommends furthermore an
increase of the army, on the cround that
it has not kept pace with the growth of the
country and the needs of the Government.
He suggests that the enlisted strength of
the army should be fixed at one soldier to
every 2000 of the population as the mini
mum, and that the maximum strength
should be determined by the President
according to the necessity and require
ments of the Nation.
Whatever may be thought of the gen
eral's recommendations in regard to an
increase in the strength of the army, there
is hardly likely to be any wide differences
of opinion concerning what he sayH of the
need of coast defenses. While the total of
his estimate is large we can see by the
amounts proposed for the defense of the
Pacific Coast that they are not excessive.
His estimates will give us fortifications at
four points along the line of our coast,
and considering the cost of modern arma
ments the sum which he suggests U cer
tainly economical.
The average citizen, busy with the affairs
of his daily vocation, does not seetho ne
cessity of military armaments as the gen
eral of the army sees it. In fact the mass
of business men regard the probability of
war as something so far and remote
that it is hardly worth while to make
preparations for it on anything like an
extensive scale. The views of such men,
however, ought not to have much weight
against those of the general of the army.
It is his duty to study the protection of
j the Nation against any possible war, and
1 when in the fulfillment of that tasK ne
makes a report concerning things needed
for our security, it would be a lack of
common-sense on our part if we should
neglect to heed what he says or fail to
carry out his recommendations as far as
they accord with National economy.
HOLIDAY GUTS.
There are many people in San Francisco
I who have friends scattered about over the
I Eastern States to whom they will wish to
! send some token of remembrance at
Christmas time, especially if they knew
juÂ«t what is the proper thine to send.
Would it not be a good idea to send
them something, little or big as the
j giver's purse and generosity may chance
jto be, that is distinctively Californian?
Borne native product in which we excel
would be particularly appropriate to send
as a gift from California, which is re
garded as a wonderland by Eastern peo
ple. The danger of duplication of gifts
would tnus almost certainly be avoided,
and so even those to whom Santa Claus
had been exceedingly bountiful would
have a novel pleasure in the remem
brances sent from the Golden State.
Were this plan generally adopted it
j would do a double benefic.ency. Besides
its uses in the world of pleasure, it would
have an influence in the world of industry
and commerce. Nearly all things have
their small beginnings, and there is no es-
I timating to what extent the samples of
I California good things thus spread broad
cast might enlarge Eastern knowledge of
our productions ana create an appetite
and demand for them.
To have such a calculating object would
not be by any means selfish, because the
benefits conferred would preponderate for
.the East. To teach the Eastern people
wtiere to send for what they are so much
in need of as California products is an ob
ject second in benevolent importance only
to sending the gospel to the heathen.
Just go down into the beautiful stores
of our City and look around you. There
are dainties both beautiful and luscious of
many kinds, pat up in small packages
and sold for moderate prices. There are
glasses of berries put up whole so that no
man need doubt their integrity. This
would mean much to the Eastern man
who has been fed on concoctions of glu
cose and sulphuric acid purporting to be
preserves of fruit. Then there is melange,
giving much in little, which would make
1 a moderate express parceL
Small light boxes of select dried figs
and prunes look tempting here, and there
they would De irresistible. Novelties of
orange, olive and redwood, photographs
and paintings of our scenery would be
more valued in the East than Mere. Then
there is wine. The list is long, but ail
choice and cheap. Scatter the samples, so
the East may learn to order its good
things from the land of delicious abun
dance and artistic beauty.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Tha Portuguese Government recently in
vited bids for building a 3600-ton cruiser. The
lowest tender came from Messrs. Schlechau
of Dantztg of $1,097,500, without arma
ment; the Germanic Company of Kiel offered
to build the cruiser for $1,112,500: the Naval
Armament Company of Barrow'g tender was
$1,1 85,000, and that of Armstrong, Mitchell
& Co. of Newcastle-on-Tyne $1,415,000.
This latter included armaments. The lowest
offerâ sl,o97,soO-is very nearly that which
the Union Iron Works received for the Charles
ton, of about the same displacement.
France has now nearly twice as large a navy
as Italy, a fact which worries Slgnor Brin and
has caused him to frame a naval programme
to cover ten years from 1897. He proposes to
build 20 vessels of different classes, 100 tor
pedo boats and 10 auxiliary vessels. The
yearly sum to be expended Is set at $6,000,
-000, or $60,000,000 for the ten-year period.
There is some difference of opinion as to
whether in the present financial straits of
Italy the revenue can bear this increased bur
den.
The Catinat, a second-class protected cruiser
of the French navy, built by cob tract, is one
of trfe most formidable vessels of moderate
displacement yet built for any navy. She dis
places 3900 tons and Is calculated to maintain
a speed of 19 knots with 9000 horsepower.
It is the battery, however, which constitutes
the remarkable efficiency of this vessel, the
armament consisting, according to latest ad
vices, of twenty-four 3.94-Inch quick-firing
guns, throwing shells of 40 pounds weight
capable of penetrating 8 inches of iron at
2500 yards. As the rapidity with which these
guns can bo fired is 15 rounds per minute the
efficiency of the Catanat practically is that of
four vessels armci with guns not of the quick
firing type, and must prove itself a very tor
midable vessel in an engagement with cruisers
ENTITLED TO THANKS OF ALL GOOD CITIZENS.
From the San Francisco News-Letter.
Much of McKinley's success on the Pacific Coast is to be attributed to the healthy
influence exerted by the San Francisco Call on all intelligent and patriotic voters.
During the campaign the editorials appearing in this up-to-date were well
written and convincing; the cartoons were apt and striking, ana the local reports were
full and fair to ail parties and candidates. Mr. Shortridge is entitled to the thanks of
every citizen who has the welfare and interests of his country at heart
of even larger size and heavier firmament but
deficient in number of guns. The cost of the
ship will reach $1,641,140, of which $249,325
is for the armament.
Next year's naval programme of Great
Britain will include three improved Tal Dot's
second-class cruisers, of 6000 ton* and 10,000
horsepower and 20-kuot speed. They will be
10 feet longer than the Talbot class, some
what finer lines and half a knot greater speed.
Four first-class cruisers of 11,000 tons and
20,000 horsepower have been contracted for
with private firms for the British navy. They
will be named Europa, Diadem, Niobe and
Sparta, and their cost ranges from $2,230,000
lo $12,240,000.
The war vessels in course of construction in
Great Britain at the end of September were as
follows: For the British Government in dock
yards 9, aggregating 80,835 tons; in private
yards Â«0 of 104,455 tons. For foreign Govern
ments there were building in private yardsJ26
war vessels, representing a total of 82,740
tons. Tnia gives a grand total of Vi> war ves
sels building for home und foreign Govern
ments of 268,030 tons.
An Interesting trial was recently made with
the Danish frigate Fyen to ascertain the ac
tual value, under certain conditions, of auxil
iary &ails on a steamer. Under steam the
irigate was making 5 knots in the teeth of a
strung topsail breeze and developed 580 horse
power. Turned 5JÂ£ points off irom the wind
her speed rose to 8 knots for the same power.
Gaff and staysails were now put on, constitut
ing au area ol 6000 square fest, after which
the speed roÂ»e to nearly 10 knots, showing the
work done by the sails to oe equal to 340
horsepower. After some hours the engine
was stopped and the speed umler sail fell to
2J^ knots, representing only 30 horsepower,
the ship beintf driven very much to leeward
on account of the small sail area, which was
not sufficient to give her requisite speed to
overcome the leeway which, on the other
band, was scarcely perceptible when steam
power was also used.

Eff cts of the Recent Decision of the
. Wright Irrigation Law on
Property Interests.
The noticeable improvement in realty affairs
as well as in other branches of business which
followed the election has continued, though
it cannot be said that the prospects of a gen
eral rise of prices in real estate are very bril
liant. In other words, the gloom nnd uncer
tainty which hung over the country pending
the recent election has been cleared away.
One of the leading topics of conversation
among the real-estate agents during the past
week has been the recent decision of tne
United States Supreme Court holding the
Wright irrigation law of California to be con
stitutional. The opinion is that the effect of
the decision will be to establish abroad a
larger degree of confidence in California in
vestments and to encourage capitalists to in
vest their money in California lands.

BAROMETER AND
THE WEATHER
Ship Captains Say It Is
Not to Be Depended On
in California.
Remains Stationary While the
Winds Howl and the
Floods Descend.
Sad Acc.dnt On the Alden Bes3e
When She Was Off the Fort
of Hono'.ulu.
British ship captains assert that Califor
nia weather jÂ«= a conundrum. When other
parts of the world in a similar latitude
and longitude are under snow and people
are wrapped up from the cold, here it is a
case of summer skies and genial weather.
AÂ«ain. when the barometer registers 29.97
or 30, and everybody expects fine weather,
the storm signals are hung out, and, sure
enough, the gale comes along. Storms
have raged up and down the coast, and
vessels that stood the full brunt of the
storm have reached port much the worse
for wear. They all showed the effect of
the storm, and in many instances vessels
came in minus a full suit of sails.
What makes the captains curious, how
ever, is the fact that since they have com
pared notes one and all declare that in no
case did the barometer vary more than a
couple of points. While the wind howled
through the rigcing and the rain came
down in torrents the marriner's stand-by
stood firm at 29.97, and gave not the
slightest warning that danger was near.
Saturday last, when the danger signal
was flying from the pole over the Chief
Wharfinger's office, the captains along the
front would hardly believe that a south
easter was corning, because they had more
faith in the barometer than in the weather
prophet. They found out their mistake
before Sunday morning. Many of the
skippers had to get out of bed in the night
and put out extra breastlines in order to
keep their vessels from going adrift.
The steam schooner Excelsior got in
from Kariuk last night, having made the
round trip in twenty-three days. This is
one of the smartest round trips on record,
and in fact Captain Higgins asserts that it
is the smartest round trip. O^i the :>lst
inst. the steamer was in a violent south
east gale and had to be beaded out to sea
in order to escape going ashore. Captain
Higgins says ne never experienced such
heavy weather on the coast. The seas ran
mountains high and, to make matters
worse, the rain and spray were almost
blinding. The Excelsior was probably in
the gale that blew the San Benito ajhore.
The bark Aiden Besse. now on her way
to San Francisco, lost one of her crew on
the down trip. On October 25, when the
vessel was making Honolulu, a sailor
named Miller was working on the martin
gale and, losing his balance, fell into the
sea. A lady passenger gave the alarm
aud several of the sailors rushed forward
and threw a lifebuoy aud ropes to
their comrade. Jim as he was making for
the lifebuoy he disappeared. The suppo
sition is that a stiarn took him under.
Miller shipped in San Francisco, and his
proper name is believed to Have been Isaac
Isaccson.
Chief Wharfinger Root entertained a
party of friends at "The Abbey," bis Sau

dition there will be several specialties, one of
which will be Professor Graber's m andolin
clais.
"Humanity" will remain on the boards at
the Columbia Theater to-night and the bal
ance of the week. This piece Is full of spirited
pictures which have caught the fanoy of the
theater-goers, who a.so enjoy the novel and
pretty scenes presented.
"The Hearts of Oak" Is what is to be pro.
duced at the Morosco Opera-house to-night. It
has been produced here before and is a domes
tic drama in which there is pathos and com
edy. There are in it a number of grand stage
pictures, Including a realistic wreck scene.
"The End of the Century" that is to be of.
fered at the Alcazar Theater this evening ig
said to be not only a new piece, but an in
tensely interesting one, in which the .members
of the Alcazar company will have an' opportu
nity to appear at their best.
The Tivoll Opera-house management has con
cluded that "Donna Juaolta" should continue
on the boards for one week longer, consequently
it will be the opera for to-night. It is a charm
ing production, full ol life, and it has much
good music.
There is an announcement of new talent at
the Orpheum for this evening. Among the
number of artists to appear are mentioned
George Thatcher and Ed Marble, well known
and popular minstrels; Heffernan , the Irish
monologue artist, and the Hengler sisters.
Professor T. A. Kennedy, who can "put a
man to sleep" without a knockout blow, pro
poses to-night to have lor his subjects on
which to show the force of hypnotism a num
ber of young women, and he claims that as
they are very susceptible he will have no
trouble to mesmerize them.
Should the weather prove all that could be
desired this evening there will be, as usual, a
number of attractive performances at the
Haight-street grounds, but rain or moonlight
the skating rink will be open and those who
are fona of lolling will find amusement there.

NEW PHASE OF
WOMEN'S RIGHTS
Mrs. Lichau and Mrs. Cra
mer Are Full- Fledged
Miners.
The California Miners' Associa
tion Grants Them Cer
tificates.
There Is Nothing in Its Constitution
to Exclude Ladies From
Membership.
To Mrs. Amelia Licbau and Mrs. Mattie
Cramer of this city belongs the unique
distinction of being the pioneer lady
members of the California Miners' Asso
ciation. They were duly enrolled by
Julian Sonntag, secretary of the associa
tion, last Friday evening, and exhibited
their respective certificates yesterday with
pardonable pride. The gratifying fact
that the constitution and by-laws of the
association do not exclude women from
membershipâ other things being equal â
furnishes yet another reason why that
organization is entitled to public recogni-
MRS. AMALIA LICHAU, the Pioneer Lady Member of the
California Miners* Association.
tion and cordial support. Mrs. Lichau
and Mrs. Cramer, as bona-tide miners who
are actively interested in several valuable
properties located in Calaveraa County,
will henceforth enjoy exactly the same
rights and privileges as the male
members of the association. Virtually,
therefore, a very considerable and influen
tial section of the community has accepted
the fundamental principles of woman's
suffrage.
Mrs. Lichau, who took the initiative in
this radical departure, is the wife of I'r.
Ernst Lichau of 423 Geary street. Dr.
Lichau, Mrs. Lichau, Mr*. Cramer and W.
G. Drown are joint owners of the claims
known as the Golden Star, the Bullseye
and the Amelia gravel claims, Angels
Camp, Calaveras County. From the doc
tor it was learned yesterday that these
claims are not far away f rum tbo famous
Utica mine, and that the ore is almost
identical in quality with that of the latter.
Recent assays gave $59 and $12 73 to the
ton. On the Golden Star the shaft is al
ready down 100 feet, and will be tapped by
a tunnel, 200 feet of which has already
been completed. Mr. Droxn, who is su
perintending the work, was formerly con
nected with the Utica and other compa
nies, and is in every respect an experi
enced miner.
Mrs. Lichau, who helped her husband
to supply the foregoing particulars, added :
"Both Mrs. Cramer and myself have re
cently returned from a trip to Mexico,
wiiicb, however, had nothing to do with
our mining interests. Soon after our ar
rival in Sau Francisco we again eet out
for Angels Camp, where we stayed about
a week and roughed it with the bestâfre
quently taking a hand in the actual work
of development. My husband attended
almost every meeting of the Miners' Con
vention, which has just closed, and on
one occasion I was au interested witness
of its proceedings."
But the role ot spectator could not lone
satisfy one of Mrs. Lichau's energy and
determination. So it wan that last Friday
evening she waited on Secretary Sonntag
and asked to be admitted to membership.
"Mr. Sonntas," continued she, "certainly
seemed surprised, but after satisfying
himself that my claim was genuine, he
said that to his knowledge there was
nothing in the constitution of the associa
tion excluding women from its Tanks, and
expressed himself as only too giaJ to
grant both myself and friend a certificate.
"1 have always taken a deep interest in
mining and read all the literature avail
able on the subject. I lately discontinued
the Chronicle in favor of The Call, be
cause The Call's articles are so much
more exhaustive and sympathetic. Be
yond the mining news I read scarcely any
thing else in the papers. I am, of course,
an enthusiastic advocate of Cabinet rep
resentation."
Mrs. Licbau stated that several other
ladies of her acquaintance are sharehold
ers in mining properties, and in this con
nection she sincerely hoped that the press
recognition of her own and her friend's
example would stimulate them to follow
it. Mrs. Licbau is at present making
preparations for a protracted stay at
Angels Camp, whither her husband pro
ceeds to-day. "I feel," eaid she, "that my
real interests are concentrated in these
claims and lam tired of doiug nothing."
Physically, it may be added, Mrs. Lichau
is admirably qualified to pursue her am
bition. She is in the prime of life and the
picture of vigorous health.
Julian Sonntag was subsequently inter-"
viewed by a Call reporter and confirmed
the story as related by Mrs. Lichau.
'.'Those ladies, "said he, "are to the best of
my knowledge the pioneer lady certificated
miners of this State, thougn in other por
tions of the Union I have frequently en
countered experienced lady miners, more
particularly in Colorado. I met one in
1893 at the Windsor Hotel, Denver, who
actually operated a mine employing sev
enty-five men. She was well versed in
metallurgy and was an expert mineralo
gist. But Mrs. Lichau and Mrs. Cramer
are the first to whom I have issued certifi
cates."
President Neff, Mr. Sonntag stated, has
not yet made up bis committees. He is
devoiing more time to the work this year
them heretofore, bat will make bis aelec
tions public when he returns to San Fran
cisco a week hence.
"It is now certain," added Mr. Sonntag,
"that the association is no longer an ex
perimental project but a thoroughly es
tablished Jact, whose usefulness must be
continued. As far as the association is
concerned I would state that while Cali
fornia would very much like to have a
Cabinet office from this State all she de
sires is to insure the appointment of a man
practically familiar wnti the wants of the
miners of America. Pennsylvania is, of
course, the greatest producer of ore in the
Union, snd in view of the fart that she
has rolled up a majority of 300.000 for Mc-
Kinley I quite agree with Mr. Yale that in
all probability she will receive the ap
pointment should it be made. At the
same time California has suffered more
from inexperience and lack of knowledge of
local conditions than any otner State in
the Union. "

After pluckily swimming to within 150
yards of tho fort. Jack Caugblin of the
Dolphin Swimming and Rowing Club had
to give up his attempt to equal Cavili's
feat in swimming from Lime Point to
Fort Point.
Had he been in condition he doubtless
would have succeeded in beating Caviil's
time, as he had but a thort distance to
swim when overcome with exhaustion.
He left Lime Point at 11:25, accom-
Danied by Captain W. O. Paten, Al Rouard
and Tom Keenan in a small|boat, and the
launches Ariel and Brisk filled witn his
clubtuates.
With a powerful side stroke he con
tinued his journey, heading in a straight
course toward the fort.
After swimming an hour and seventeen
minutes he up the attempt.
When taken aboard tho boat he waa in
an exhausted condition and for a time did
not know where he was. He was unable
to open hia hands for at least ten minutes,
the water having chilled them.
After the swim Caugnlin said he would
have succeeded had he rot had a choppy
sea to contend against. He said the water
was colder than he had ever experienced
and that the sun shining on the water
caused it to elure in his eyes during the
swim. He admitted not having made
any preparation for the swim, but said
the next time he attempted it he would
be in perfect condition.

THE PASSING
OF OLD MILLER
Death of the Octogenarian
Court Block Jan
itor.
For More Than Forty Years He
Filled That Humble
Position.
The Deceased Was Known and Re
spacted by Many Celebrated
Lawyersâ His Life.
The death briefly announced yesterday
of John H. Miller, the octogenarian jan
itor of the Court block, has removed an
other interesting figure long familiar to
the older portion of tne legal fraternity.
He passed quietly away on Saturday last
at his own home in Selina place, his de
cease being directly attributable to sheer
old age.
For more than forty years "Old Man"
Miller filled the humble position of janitor
at the Court block â a three-story struc
ture which runs from Clay to Merchant
street, near the site of the old City HaJl.
In earlier days this building was occupied
almost exclusively by lawyers, though
now abandoned, with few exceptions, for
quarters more pretentious in character.
But the old Court block, even if it cannot
claim the merit of architectural magnifi
cence, bas seen several generations of oc
cupants, many of whom have achieved
distinction at the bar.
Among such were Judge S. C. Hastings,
James B. Haggin, now so celebrated on
the turf, Lloyd Tevis, "Rube" Lloyd, that
famous old District Attorney Harry
Byine, Judge T. W. Freelon, Judge A. B.
Ba'.es, J. B. Felton and Juri.^e J. B. Bald
win, whom all knew arid respected Miller.
O. T. SShuch, also a former occupant of
the Court block, has known Miller since
1851 and furnishes the followins outline of
his career: Miller was born in Barbadoes
and was the son oi a Scotch capiain, who
married a native of the West Indies. But
though a mulatto Miller was never a
slave. He emigrated to New York in
early life and while there entered the
service of a wealthy Carolina family,
whose plantation near Charleston he man
aged for many years. In 1851 or there
abouts he removed with his wife to San
Francisco, where he resided uninterrupt
edly until his death on Saturday. This
circumstance in itself would be sufficiently
remarkable, but the additional fact that
throughout that long period of years he
never held any other position ttian the
one in which he died is even more so.
Mr. Shuck left the Court block a few
years ago and temporarily lost sight ol the
old janitor. Passing the building onedav
last year he saw Miller coming out of the
door, his tall form somewhat bowed by
age but his step still active and his eye

Tho Superintendent of Streets has served
notices upon all residents along Chestnut
â¢treet, west of Telegraph Hill, ordering them
to change the numbers on their houses before
the end of the present month in conformance
with a new system making allowance for an
additional block of a hundred numbers near
the beginning of the street. The penalty for
not observing this order is arrest and liability
for misdemeanor. The addition of the re
cently graded hill block does not increase cacti
succeeding house number an even hundred,
for much of the old numbering has Dccii
changed in each block. For instance, a housa
that used to be 517 may now be 633, and so on.

MADE A STORE
INTO A TEMPLE
Dedicatory Exercises of the
Christian Endeavor
Fane.
A New Branch of Work Under
taken by an Eager and
Industrious Band.
R v W. B. Berry to Be the Pastor
Ladies Who Hay. Started a
Practical Mission.
The Christian Endeavor Fane was con
secrated to God ye-terday afternoon by
the Rev. W. B. Berry, who will be the
pastor in charge of tbe earnest workers
who have selected this little temple as the
headquarters for their labors in a com
munity where they confidently look for
ward to tne establishment of a tine church
in the future. The work for the present
will be the teaching of Sunday-School
classes there and teaching the gospel every
Lord's day.
This mission is under the auspices of the
Christian Endeavorers of the West Side
Christian Church, of which Rev. W. A.
Gardner is the pastor. He gives the chief
credit of the enterprise to Mrs. Olivia
Hodgen and Mi>s Nettie E. Gardner.
It was the work o> the intermediate
( las 3, which is one of the three classes of
the West Side church. The teacher of this
class, D. F. Parker, also comes in for a large
share of his pastor's commendation. He
is a prominent young business man. In
his address at the dedication services yes
terday he explained that bis instrumen
tality in the affair bad consisted mainly
in insisting on practical Christianity.
When his scholars talked of what they
wished they could do be urged them on to
make their dreams realities.
The services were opened by W. A.
Gardner. After the hymn "ltejo.ee and
i) â¢â  Glad" tbe lesion was read from tbe
eigbty-fourtu Psalm, in which occur the
appropriate words, "How amiable are thy
tabernacles, O Lord of hosts," "My soul
lonceth for the courts of the Lord," "I
had rat er be a doorkeeper in tbe house
of my God than dwell in the tenta of the
wicked."
The address of W. B. Berry was solemn
and beautiful, expressing tbe hope and
conviction that the initial step had been
taken of a great good to be accomplished,
not only in that community, but all over
the City.
He took his text from Puilirpians 3d
and 13th, "'This one thing i do, forget
ting those things which are behind and
reaching forth unto those thinps wbicn
are before I preÂ«s toward the mark of the
hign calling of God in Christ Jesus."
Attention was called to this wisdom of
Paul having been learned from Jesus,
whose religion was one which provided for
progress. He spoke oi the great value of
practical Christianity, and illustrated the
good of it by pointing out how this mis
sion had been started by the ladies doing
work for it and asking money from no
one. They evn washed tbe windows and
cleaned the floors, and this, the pastor
*aid, was far better work than merely
praying for Rood to come.
Ttie final address was made by Miss E
Berry, who has done a great deal of mis
sion work In this and in foreign countries.
In introducing her Rev. Mr. Gardner
made a playful allusion to her name and
tbe first speaker's by stating the fact that
the audience was enjoying a feast of
"berries."
The little fane, as they call it in order to
have a name fresher and more specific
than mission, was crowded to the door.

A Decent City Hall for Oakland
Should Figure in the Municipal
Platforms-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 22. f
â¢The time has now arrived when there
should be in this city a powerful mercan
tile organization. During the past five
years all the surrounding towns, even as
far as Hnywards, have been brought al
most into Oak.'and by frequent and cheap
electric-car service. The trade of Oakland
has almost doubled, but with little ap
parent resultant benefit to its merchants.
This is due to lack of a concentration of
r. terests.
/â¢ There is a Merchants' Exchange and a
T foard of Trade, both of which organiza
* Lions have done eood work, but there has
always been considerable friction between
them, which has prevented any joint ef
forts for their mutual welfare. There are
many changes necessary before Oakland
and surrounding territory can grow com
mercially, and these cannot be brought
about by any clique or party, but can only
be secured by unity of action.
Th c forecast of the changes is most cer
â¢ tainly a thorough and intelligent under
standing of the needed license system.
That it is now prinutive.ciude and discrim
inating there can be no don bt. The levying
of all manner of licenses on the solicitors
and deliverers from outside places has
worked great harm to local merchants.
Firms who formerly did $100 worth of
ousiness a week in this city were driven
to establishing branch houses over here
and now do four times the business.
â¢ Berkeley retaliated by passing a prohibit
ive license and a leading member of the
â¢ Merchants' Exchange was forced to open
.Ta branch store in that town in order to
hold his trade and evade an extortionate
license. A leading member of the Board
of Trade and a lsr^e manutacturer had
â¢â¢been forced to call in a large number of
bis travelers because of prohibitory local
licenses, and the business they obtained
' no longer comes to Oakland.
Several commission merchants cross
the bay every morning to buy produce in
San Francisco that is produced in Ala
meda County, and which is brought back
â¢ here for conspmDtion, and which process
is the result of the license imposed on
producers who bring their goods inside
the fire limits.
These are a few of the details that need
adjustment, but so long as the interests of
a few are to be paramount to the welfare
of the community just so long will Oak
land suffer. There will be no improve
ment till there is a powerful commercial
organization dominated by the spirit of
â  men whose ideas travel farther than their
â¢store door. Such an organization could
toy the appointment of various commit
. tees deal with all the problems now being
handled by the various bodies and would
make possible the establishment of a
(Produce Exchange which is an actual ne
. cessity in an agricultural county like Ala
meda.
. Â« Very. rarely is the proper credit accorded
the District Attorney's office for the milk
o! human nature which it frequently dis
- senses in the conduct of criminal cases.
More frequently the office is harshly criti
cized and hampered in the discharge of
its duty by those who do not under
.stand how matters stand or who
are. willfully prejudiced. It is gen
erally considered that the duty of the pub
lic prosecutor is to attempt to land in jail
cv.cry one who breaks the laws. This is,
o.f course, true in the case of criminals,
but there are many younir people arrested
who do wrong, not fully comprehending
the nature of their offense, or because of
the influences of older companions who
have motives for leading them astray. In
such instances justice can be best sub
served by the exercise of kindness and
. humanity, and the foundations of good
citizenship laid instead of a life of crimi
naiity.
During the incumbency of District At
torney Snook several of these instances
have arisen and young men who under a
less humane administration would now
be convicts are reputable members of so
ciety. A lew years in the District Attor
. nev's office reveals all the phases of hu
..inanity's weakness and teaches that
reformation is not always brought about
by virulent prosecution.
Alameda has at least one thing that she
can point to with the finger of pride
while the linger of derision is pointed
toward Oakland. The Encinal City has a
municipal buildiug that is a credit to her,
while Oakland has a wooden barn that is
periodically condemned by the Board of
Health.
Aiameda's handsome brick and stone
block not only adds to the dignity of the
municipal government, but it is an insult
to expect any of Oakland's officials to
show its municipal pile to a visiting
Mayor, and yet Alameda is several classes
behind Oakland in the rank of cities.
In a few weeks the various municipal
tickets and platforms will De placed be
fore the public, and the one that is pledged
to secure needed improvements will be en
titled to the largest share of support. A
plank providing for an ample municipal
building on the Jines that have been laid
down so often would command more re
spect than the stereotyped, meaningless
language that is so often foisted on the
voters. Stuart W. Booth.

Owners Who Persistently

Oakland Offtce Baw Frawcisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Nov. 22. f
The Oakland Board of Trade was sur
prised last night by a woman. Mrs.
Cornelia E. Cunningham addressed the
members and they freely admit that they
left the hall with more new ideas than
they had thought of for the past three
months.
Mrs. Cunningham was the organizer of
the Livermore League of Progress, and she
came to Oakland to tell the board what
had been accomplished and to solicit their
co-operation in instituting a representa
tive and permanent county exhibit.
The members opened their eyes with
wonder when they listened to the plain
story of what the speaker had accom
plished, noton'y by her individual efforts,
but in conjunction with other active work
ers in her town.
For several months she has been ex
ploring the interior of the county, finding
out who owned property and paid no per
sonal attention to its welfare. She made
it her business to call on the owners, many
of whom reside in San Francisco, and tell
them that they are an lucubus on the com
munity. She unhesitatingly expressed
her opinion of the rnilli naire Arthur
Rogers, who recently married Mrs. Mont
gomery. Mr. Rogers owns a beautiful
ranch of 160 acres, which is in rnin. It is
neglected, uncultivated, and the porch is
falling from the front of the dwelling.
Several other instances were recounted,
and Mti. Cunningham is determined that
some improvement shall be made. She
bas even gone to the leneth of forcing
some of these indifferent land-owners to
put a price on their property at which
they will sell, and is doing her best to find
markets for them so that many of the un
employed can be put to work.
The lady is anxious for the Board of
Trade to take the initial steps in forming,
in conjunction with other mercantile or
ganizations in the interior of the county,
a Produce Exchange which shall be the
means of providing a home market for
Alameda produce. She recited several in
stances of people having to send their
goods to San Francisco, whire they were
purchased lor the home market, and
when sold in Oakland brought about two
prices. This, she asserted, is because of a
near-sighted policy that has dominated |
the construction of the municipal license
ordinances ; it is a fact that no farmer cau
sell one dollar's worth of his produce in
Oakland unless he has a license. A few
days ago a farmer was stopped at Frank
lin street and told he could go no farther
with his chickens unless be had a license.
He was prepared io sell them and make
money on them at 30 cents apiece, whereas
the majority of thorn are shipped to San
Francisco, come back to Oakland and sell
for 50 cents.
Mrs. Cunningham has really undertaken
a great and urand task, and has already
accomplished much in the short time she
has been at work. There are hundreds of
small farmers and producers in thie
county who are absolutely powerless to
bring about better times unaided. Mrs.
Cunningham isc -rtstin that with a healthy
and practical co-operation and the estab
lishment of a Produce Exchange much
can be done.
The establishment of the large creamery
near Livermore has already done much
toward keeping foreign butter out of the
market. Mrs. Cunningham declares that
$3,000,000 goes out oi California annually
for the purchase of eggs, all oi which
could be kept here. At me present time
eggs are higher in price than in any other
State, and yet hundreds of people are as
sured of a market for their produce should
they embark in this industry.
It was moved thai the suggestions and
recommendations of Mrs. Cunningham be
indorsed by the board and that the chair
man appoint a committee of five to co
operaie with the lady in establishing a
permanent exhibit of the products of the
county.
The chairman named the following com
mittee: J. W. Nelson, Craigie Sharp,
A. D. Pryal, J. Tyrrell. H. O. Trow

BERKELEY MEN REST.
The California Football Heroes Are
Beady for the Great StruggleâJn
niors' Celebration.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 25.â The Uni
versity football men spent Sunday in
peace and quiet, resting for the great
struggle of next Thursday. Some of them
who live around the bay went home for
the day to visit their families; others
stayed at the training-house on Union
street the entire time, while still others
took a short ramble among the hills after
dinner.
1 heir bard, pounding work bas all been
done and the remaining three days will be
given up to lipht, secret practice and sig
nal work. The men will be given every
opportunity to rest as much as possible
from their long season of practice before
the final struggle. Tie demand for seats
has been unusually large for so early in
the season of sale, and indications point
that there will be at least 12,000 people at
the jrame if the day is clear. Accommo
dations will be provided lor 15,000. AU
the seats in the university club section are
gone, as well as all the choicest onea in

which were occupied by Stanford at the
last game. Fifty-six covered boxes have
been provided on the west side, all of
which have been ordered. No one will be
allowed to stand this year in front of the
bleachers, as has been* the custom hereto
fore. A raised, sloping platform will be
provided for those who come in on gen
eral admission tickets and expect to
stand. Better police protection and ush
ering will also be provided.

T. J. LACEY IS CALLED.
Has Not Yet Filed II in Acceptance With
the Vestry.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 22.â The vestry
have given Rev. T. J. Lacey, first assist
ant rector of St. Luke's Episcopal Church
of Brooklyn, N. V., a unanimous call to
accept the rectorship of Christ's Church
here. The reverend gentleman is a sin
gle youne man well known to the clergy
of San Frajcisco, where he was assistant
to toe rec ;or of St. Luke's Church.
Mr. Lacey has not yet been heard from
on the subject, hence Bishop Nichols
could not announce his acceptance At the
service to-night, as the vestry had hoped
he could. An answer was expected to the
call to-day, but di i not arrive.
SPOKE ON TEMPERANCE.
Mrs. Henrietta Skelton In the Weil
Side Chritilan 4-hurch.
The West Siae Christian Church was
crowded last evening, &a it had been
previously announced that Mrs. Henrietta
Skelton would address the congregation.
Mrs. Bkelton is an ardent worker for the
Women's Christian Temperanoe Union,
and declares that it is the only organiza
tion outside of the pulpit that teaches the
better and higher life.
She said that in every station of life
there was work for the members of the
union, and as they looked for new avenues
to enter they found many obstructions,
but nothing could deter them from com
ing to the rescue of the young. "We
have laws in our statutes to-day,'' she
said, "that never wouid have been there
had it not been for our persistent efforts,
and unless we crush the liquor traffic un
der the heel of the Christian it will crush
us.
"It is a necessity to have a union in con
nection with the church, and we should
be proud to belong to au organization thai
reaches the farthest end of the earth. It
means something to have a large constitu
ency, as this is the most wonderful society
on the face of the earth.
"We are anxious to enlarge our work, so
don't be afraid to wear a white ribbon.
Of course the fashionable people won't
wear one â they would rather wear a dia
mond rinir."
Mr?. Skelton then announced that a tab
let would be passed around the congreea
ticn, and those that wished to join the
union would please sign their names to it.
ILiere were very lew signatures seemed.
SUNDAY WITH
THE PUGILISTS
Bob Fitzsimmons Tramping
Through the Deep
Marin Mud.
How Baby Bob Takes a Run
Over the Hills With His
Big Dad.
Sharkey Flanges Along the Beach
"Scoffing" the Silthorse Breezes
Hi Loves.
Robert Fitzsimmons, who has expressed
his Intention to interview Thomas Shar
key shortly, says that Sausalito in the wet
season is not an ideal spot for pedestrian
ism. Under the rains that have fallen
since he located there for training pur
poses the roads are too muddy and the
hills too slippery for tramping. Not that
he expects to do much walking when he
gets roped in with Thomas early next
month â the naval hero tights at exceed
ingly short ranpe â but Robert desires to
be springy on hia feet that he may suc
cessfully dodge the enemy's raking fire.
Consequently while Sharkey is plunging
along the Cliff House beach "scoffing' â a
naval term for eating â the salthorse
breezes he loves so well, Fitz is plowing
hock deep in the Marin County clay and
muttering imprecations upon Corbett'a
diminished bead.
It is Corbett he wants to meetâ Corbett,
the man who has been giving him a long
chase for years, he says.
"I'll hit Sharkey right in the sama
eve that the 'Pompadour' strucK," said
F~itzsimmons yesterday, "but the lick will
knock him clear out. When those ten
rounds are over my friend Sharkey will
probably go down in the 'sick bay' â I be
lieve that is Â«hat they call the hospital
aboard ship. But Sharkey is straigut,
and we will doubtless make it interesting
for each other when we meet, and I can't
say the same for Corbett.
"I want to get at that man for a finish
most anxiously, but he is more slippery
than these roads. If I can't get a finish
out of him I'll fight him two rounds, or
even one, if he will let that be Jong enough
till I am satisfied. Well, lam going to
take the baby out for a run ; come along."
Then Mrs. Fitzsimmons blanketted Rob*
crt Jr. against the chill of the evening and
deposited him in his small buggy, while
his big blonde dad took his station behind
the vehicle and the procession started.
'â Corbett does not want to meet me,"
said he as he guided the baby buggy care
fully around a mudhole. "I'm not say
ing this for publication only, but because
lam convinced that it is true. Champion
fighter! He's the champion faker!"
Then the long Cornisa blacksmith set
off at a swinging stride down the road at
a speed that threatened to drop the junior
into the gutter. This brought forth a
protest from Mrs. Bob, who was standing
at the gate watching the start, ana the
two Roberts struch a slower pace.
"Bob is a good nurse," said the mother,
keeping her eyes on the two till they dis
appeared round the hill, "but he forgets
that baby is not so athletic as his father.
Mr. Fitrsimmons is confident he will win
and so am I. Oh, yes, I take a great in
terest in the coming affair, and I am do
ing my part of the training. You see, I
am chief stewardess of these quarters and
prepare the food that goes on his table. I
am an old athlete myself. You remember
the Rose and Martin Julian who used to
do acrobatic and contortionist turns on
the road, don't you? That was before
Rose Julian became Mrs. Bob Fitzaim
muus."
The pugilist nad quite a reception at his
training quarters yesterday and a large
number ol clubmen and newspaper repre
sentatives witnessed his exercises. "He
strikes like the sledgehammer he used to
wield and he is as quick on his feet as a
cat. Sharkey must move speedily if be
hauls clear of those heavy lightning-like
strikes.
Tom Sharkey. "the pride of the navy,"
spent his time ysterday receiving his
friends at his quarters at the Cliff. "I
don't work on Sunday and so I have time
to see those who call out here to say 'How
do you do?' Weie there many? Well, I
should say io. There was Alex Greg
eain?, Billy Murphy andâ well, what's the
use of going any further. If I could
name them all I'd keep you writing names
till 6 o'clock in the morning."
The man who is to meet Fitzsimmons
was attired in a neat, well-fitting suit of
navy blue, a heavy white swea'er and a
brown Derby bat, and as he walked up
and down in" front of his quarters or stood
talking with friends cr admirers he was
gazed at by crowds, who stood at a re
spectful distance and criticized his ap
pearance. No one who was not on speak
ing terms with him seemed to care to ap
proach him without an introduction, for
his features are such that they convey the
idea that he is distant to strangers, and
one of his friends said, "He don't kitten
to blokes that only want to chin wid him."

Active Competition in the Columbia
Club for Several Valuable
Medals.
There were all kinds of target-shooting
at the Shell Mound rifle range yesterday.
Although the weather was threatening in
tlie extreme, it made but little difference
to the marksmen, who were bent upon
winning medals, cash prizes, turkeys and
pigs. Captain Siebe, the proprietor of the
park, decided that the closing of that
pleasure resort for the season sbould be
properly celebrated, and be offered a
choice collection of tnrkeys, pips and
goese as prizes. These inducements, to
gether with the other attractions, filled
the range. There was a lot of fun when
the distribution took place. Men already
burdened with heavy rifles, cartridge
cases and overcoats were obliged to shoul
der barley-sacks containing gobbling and
hissing fowls and squealing porkers. The
railroad men and ferry-boat hands looked
suspiciously on their passengers who
crossed the bay late in the afternoon.
Tickets were shot as usual on prize con
tests on the German ring target. AU 25,
24, 9 and 1 rints were good for a Thanks
giving dinner. Nearly all the winners
secured more than one prize. The follow
ing gentlemen are sure of a Fquare meal
or two the next few days. The winners
and the winning shots were as follows:
George Alpers, 24, 24, 24; J. Peters, 25, 25 ;

The Norddeutscher Schuetzen Club
held its grand annual prize shoot. Three
hundred dollars was offered in prizes;
fifteen prizeÂ«>, ranging from $2 to $20, for
the best centers, and fifteen prizes simi
larly distributed for the most points on
the small point tariret, with cash prizes
for first and last bullseyes. There were also
twelve cash prizes, from $2 to $20, shot for
on the man target. Several thousand
shots were fired in these events, and the
results will not be known until this even
ing, when the several secretaries will
have nad a chance to figure up all the
tickets shot into. The first bullseye in
the forenoon was made by F. P. Schuster,
and the last before noon by A. H. Pape.
The ttrst in the afternoon was by Philo
Jacoby, and the last by J. Utschig.
Among those highest on the man tnrget
were: L. Haake 76, George Alpers 74, Philo
Jacoby 73, A. H. Strecker 73, and D. W.

cupied by the Columbia Pistol and Rifle
Club, and the firing on the 200-yard range

did not cease as long as the black in the
target could be seen. There is a spirited
fight on for the Gliudermann military
musket medal. As the scores stood at the
end of the day F. O. Young is in the lead
on the best ten scores with a total of 463
military count on the Columbia target.
Ed Hovey gained a point yesterday, and
now has 460 to bis credit. Ue was so
fortunate as to make two dead centers in
the inch circle, for which there are casn
prizes. Centers yesterday on this match
were worth $6 apiece. F. H. Bushnell is
third on the lilt with a total of 453. Con
sidering that he has been shooting the
musket only three or four weeks he is
justly proud of his record.
On the pistol range there is a new
marksman, Charles R. Yates of Oakland.
He was introduced by Colonel S. I. Kel
logg. Mr. Yates' fancy is the revolver, and
his first efforts on a strange target caused
the older revolver-shots to recognize a
dangerous rival for medals and honors.
As t tie season draws to a close the inter
est in the Blanding pistol medal match
and 22-caliber rifle matches is increasing.

BATTED OUT 16 TO 1.
Alameda Alerts Outclassed Saistm Ba
players in Yesterday*
Game.
The score stood 16 to 1 from the fifth to
the eighth inning yesterday afternoon,
with the plucky little Alameda Alerts at
the big end and the Suisun baseball team
cherishing the lonely tally.
The Alerts won with the score 17 to 2,
1 and without using their last inning.
Suisun was outclassed. Only two of her
nine put up accurate ball, such as charac
terized the Alerts' play. The right field
and the pitcher were superior to their
support. Unfortunately for the speedy
pitcher his regular catcher was not oh
hand, nor was the first baseman. Their
places were occupied until the fifth inning
by two volunteer local substitutes, who
were each responsible for several costly
bad plays.
Fifteen of the seventeen runs were
scored before the first catcher was moved
to shortstop, the shortstop to first base,
the unskilful first baseman retired, a new
catcher put in, and the third baseman
changed into left field, where, though he
continued to muff with considerable regu
larity, his faults were not so costly.
Suisun's batters seemed afraid until the
latter half of the same to stand up close
to the plate and face the outcurves of
Alerts pitcher.
A pretty stop of a line drive was made
in the eighth inning by the Alert pitcher,
who carelessly tossed out his left hand and
took the Dali with an easy indifference
that delighted and surprised the specta
tors Â«s well as the man that made the play
that retired the side.
The Hollisiers, the famed great rivals of
Aiameda's pet?, rfli play the Alerts at
Central Park next Sunday afternoon.

HANDBALL COURTS.
Two Exciting and Closely Contested
Game* Flayed in Which Nealon
and Donnelly Participated.
Several exciting games were played in
the San Francisco Handball Court yester
day. The chief interest centered in two
games in which J. C. Neaion and P. T.
Donnelly, the amateur champion, par
ticipated. In the first, Neaion ana R.
Linehan, the overhand swiper, defeated
Donnelly and J. Feeney in a close and ex
citing finish. Neaion and Donnelly
then played together against Line
han and Feeney, and the two lat
ter won the final by only one ace. To the
surprise of the spectators D. Rodgers and
L. Corraine defeated G. McDonald and
Phil Ryan, as the two latter had been
talking about havine an "easy thing."
Owinc to the wet weather no games
were played in the Union Court, which is
uncovered. The court has passed into the
hamJs of its former proprietor, "Billy"
McManus, who promises to bring it up to
its previous popularity.
Following were the games played in the

MADIOAX A CO.
J. L. BARDWELL
AND HIS CLOCK
He Threatens to Remove It
From the Golden Gate
Park Museum.
Its Position Was Changed by
Order of Director-General
de Young.
School Children at the Cliff Baths.
Two Balloon Ascensions From
Haight-Street Grounds.
John L. Bardwell was one of the many
who were in the museum in Golden Gate
Park yesterday, but he was not pleased â
in fact,, he was mad. The reason for his
anger was that in hi 3 opinion he had not
been treated with the consideration that
he believes he is entitled to as a donor of
{ curios.
Mr. Bardwell, who is an enthusiastic
collector, has already donated many relics
to the museum and promised many more.
He has donated so many that they have
all been placed in one room and over it is
the inscription, "Bardwell's Curiosity
Shop." Some time ago he expressed hi 3
dislike of the large clock that for two
years had occupied a place on the north
side of the vestibule and said he would re
place it with a handsomer one. He was
as good as his word, and sent out one
twelve feet in height, which originally
i cost $'250. This clock is a fine one and he
â  said that he would donate it with the un-
I d&rstanding that it should occupy the
I place of the old one, and it was put in po
sition. Yesterday when he visited the
I museum ne discovered that it had been
moved into a corner, where it was out of
sight. He asked how it came to be placed
there, ana the answer was, "By order of
Mr. de Young."
Mr. Bardwell in no uncertain tone of
voice said: "That clock has not yet been
donated, and if it is not put back where it
belongs, in pie place of De Young's
picture, I willtake it away and cease any
lurther donations to the museum."
When questioned in regard to this inci
dent Mr. Bardwell stated that he did not
care to talk about the matter at this time,
and added: "All I will say is that the
clock goes back or it goes out."
A portion of the park force is engaged
at this time in thinning out the forest
trees in different parts of the park. "We
are obliged to do this every now- and
then," said Superintendent McLaren,
"for the trees must hay- light, air and
room in which to develop."
There was not a very large crowd at the
beach and Sutro baths until late in the
afternoon. There were the usual attrac
tions in the baths, which furnished enter
tainment. The offer of the management
to admit school children free on Satur
days has met with a response beyond ex
pectation, the young ones attending in
large numbers.
The biggest outdoor crowd was in the
Haight-street grounds, the great attrac
tion there being two balloon ascensions-
C. W. Vosmer made a successful ascent
at 4 o'clock, and after remaining up about
ten minutes cut away and came down
with his parachute at Hayes and Gough
streets. The balloon was inflated again at
5 o'clock, and was sent up with Ernil
Markeburg at the parachute, but he did
not go up, for some one had cut the rope
that connected the parachute with the in
flated sphere, so that only a thread re
mained. When the weieht of the para
chute and the balloonist forced against
this shred it parted and Markeburg
tumbled to the ground. The balloon was
coon recovered and inflated again, and a
very fine ascent and parachute drop was
the result. This was at 5:50 o'clock, and
as the aeronaut came down '.he search
light was thrown on him, and as be was
enveloped in a bright glare there were
many who were under the impression
that they were looking at the airship.
MarKebarg was voted the more graceful
aeronaut.

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA
In place of an emergency call in San
Francisco the military authorities con
sidered the suggestion of calling out
National Guardsmen to co-operate with
the police in resisting an imaginary at
tack. The rainy weather caused one post
ponement of the plan, and according to
gossip in guard circles the Governor and
Adjutant-General caused the plan to be
abandoned entirely. It is easy enough for
spectators to perceive that perfect har
mony does not exist in the National
Guard. Subordinates busy themselves too
much in running to the Governor and
Adjutant-General when orders from the
division or brigade do not accord with
their notions. Too many, apologies are
being made for the enlisted men of the
Guardâ more than they desire. Since
the reports telegraphed from San Diego
indicated that half the Guard would die
of exposure if called out for active service
with the present equipments, veterans in
the service of the State do not care to be
regarded as tender plants ready to perish
as soon as removed from a warm atmos
phere.
Colonel Frank W. Sumner is again in
active service. He has been appointed
colonel and inspector of the staff of
Major-General James. Colonel Sumner
held the position of paymaster-general on
the staff of Governor Markham. He is
well up in military tactics and takes a
deep interest in National Guard affairs.
Marion M. Ogden of Los Angeles has
been commissioned lieutenant - colonel
and A. D. C. on the staff of Governor
Budd. Colonel Ogden as a commissary
officer some years ago performed his duty
in a manner so higliiy creditable that he
was specially mentioned in reports to the
War Department.
George W. Pipr>y has been commis
sioned lieutenant-colonel on the staff of
the commander-in-chief, to succeed Lieu
tenant-Colonel \V. J. Younger.
First Brigade.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Nov. 19.â
The war is over, the battle won and Com
pany Seventh Regiment, is home again,
safe, sound and happy. The emergency
call came last Saturday (November 14). at
1:45 P. m. In just one hour and forty- fire
minutes forty-live men had reported for
duty, some of them having been sum
moned from a distance of six miles, and
were in line ready to march. Every man
was in heavy marching order, with
blanket, canteen filled with water, haver
sack containing one day's rations, con
sisting of bread, meat, beans, coffee, salt
and pepper; kuiie, fork, spoon, tin cup
and meat-ration can, twenty rounds of
ball cartridges and his rifle, as per instruc
tions from superior headquarters.
The streets in and around the armory
were crowded with people asking ques
tions, wondering what it all meant and
many of them commending the boys for
their prompt response to the call. The
old Grand Army men were everywhere in
the crowd, some of tnem coming into the
armory to watch the boys making their
preparations and best of all cheering them
as they marched awayâ where, none of
them knew or hardly asked.
Promptly at 3:30 p. m. the command was
marched out to the street by Lieutenant
Sloat and turned over to Captain Goff.
Fours right, march; the men swing into
place and the company is off. Down E
street and out into the open country over
a dusty and very sandy road for nearly
rive miles, then up through Riche Can
yon for three miles to the Heron ranch,
where they arrived at 6:25 p. m. No time
was lost in pitching camp. Four men from
each squad were detailed to procure wood
and water and four to pitch the tents. At
7 o'clock every tent was in place, fires
lighted and supper well under way. A
temporary guard was thrown out immedi
ately upon arrival, and every man buckled
to bis work with a will. Company G of
Redlands arrived about 7:15 p. m., and M
of Riverside at 9 P. m. Guard was mounted
as soon as all the companies were in camp
and every one settled a own to rest and
Bleep at 10:45 p. m., when taps were blown.
The regular routine of camp duties was
taken up in the morning. No time was
given for recreation, but all stood up to
their work like soldiers. Camp was struck
at 2:45 p.m. It was an inspiring sight.
At the last note of retreat a shot was fired
as a signal to strike tents, and in just five
minutes every tent was â¢ own, rolled, tied,
and with the poles loaded in the wagons.
It was quick work, but old X can do quick
work when necessary.
The homeward march was commenced
at 2:55 P. m., ana in just two hours and
nine minutes. Company X was in its
armory, having covered the eight miles
without a mishap or accident of any Kind
and every man carrying his entire equip
ment as on the outward march. Not a
word of complaint was heard from any
man during the outing, and the fact that
forty-one of the forty-five men who made
the trip reported at roll-call on Monday
evening Is the best evidence that the men
were in first-class condition upon tneir ar
rival home.
The emergency call was a success so far
as Company X is concerned, and there is
no doubt that it will eventually re
dound to the benefit of the entire guard.
It has certainly shown how badly they are
in need of blankets and overcoats, and it is
to be hoped they will be furnished with
out unnecessary delay. Ad a walkist Cap
tain Goff can take the belt.
Camp Berry developed any number of
cood cooks, for a cook must be good who
car. eat his own creations.
Lieutenants Sloat and Seccombe came
up smiling at every watering place. .
Corporal Irving says the muddy river is
not in it with this trip.
Private Lyster iorgot his white vest, so
could not mash queen bees.
Major J. W. F. Diss. inspector/First
Brigade, camped with the men, and his
jeport will be anxiously looked for.
Major Frank C. Prescott was in com
mand of the camp,. with Lieutenant Higby
as battalion adjutant.
Second' Brigade.
The Second Brigade was not included in
the emergency call. It seems that repre
sentations were made to the division
general that so many of the First Regi
ment's men were employed in retail mer
cantile houses that a general response to
a Saturday night call for duty would seri
ously interfere with their employment.
Men who know the First Regiment under
stand that tbe organization is ready at any
time to respond to a call for duty.
Capta.n Jenks, Troop A, cavalry, and
his troopers are ready to meet any com
petition that may come in the form of
another mounted company in San Fran
cisco. The captain reports the troop in
firdt-class condition. Some excellent ma
terial has recently been recruited. During
the past week a youne gentleman who
was closely identified with the crack
cavalry troop in New York joined Cap
tain Jenks' company. Other enlistments
equally gratifying have been recorded.
The trooper? are in the National Guard
and propose to hold the leading place.
Colonel William Macdonald. First In
fantry, has gone north on a leave of ab
sence, and Lieutenant-Colonel Victor D.
Dnboce is in command of the regiment.
The chief topic of interest in the regiment
is the selection of 100 men to shoot for a
trophy in competition with an equal num
ber of men from the Hawaiian National
Gnard.
Companies C and G of the First In
fantry achieved a great success with their
minstrel show at the Ellis-street Armory
last Wednesday evening. Tne cash re
ceipts will materially replenish the treas
ury. The "Nationals'* are anxiously
awaiting the revised Infantry Drill Regu
lations, which may be officially issued
from the War Department early in De
cember.
Company G, Fifth Infantry, Alameda,
on Thursday evening laai, elected Lieu
tenant M. W. Simpson captain, vice
Chipnian resigned; " Private Charles
Pickett was elected lieutenant, vice Simp
son promoted. Major D. S. Dorn, judge
advocate, presided at the election.
PETALUMA, Cal.. Nov. 19.â Company
C, Fifth Infantry, gave their first formal
hop last Monday evening, which was well
attended, the soldiers being first put
through the regular weekly drill, then
divided into squads and turned over to
the corporals for skirmish drill, after
which came the dancing.
P. C. Peters, a drill master of the San
Francisco Police Department, was here
the other day and wouid like to arrange a
shooting match between a team of the
City police and a team from Company C,
which event would undoubtedly create
much interest.
The members of Company C have been
expecting a^ sudden call for a promised
emergency drill, and during some testing
of the new electric light machines the
whistles sounded as warning to linemen
at work caused some of the members of
the company to drop their work instanter
and make a rush for the armory, only to
find they were not expected. 80 they are
still on the lookout lor the signal.
Tne new riding club met during the
week and formed a temporary civil or
ganization by electing Captain E. G.
Eisen as temporary president and Captain
J. A. Margo as temporary vice-president.
The committee on membership has
passed upon thirty-eight applications and
has still seventeen to act upon. It is ex
pected that seventy-five men will be en
rolled at the end of the month, when the
permanent organization will be effected.
Until suitable quarters can be obtained
it is proposed to rent reoms for the use of
the organization, and in the meantime the
Veteran Corps has kindly tendered the
use of its rooms in the Flood building.
The committee on membership will meet
there on Wednesday evening to act upon
applications submitted.
In case the organization is mustered
into the guard it is the intention of the
members to have weekly mounted drillb
and the men thoroughly instructed aa
cavalry.
Third Brigade.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 21.â 0n the
whole the emergency call of last Monday
ni^ht was by no means a glaring success,
and has by no means met with the unqual
ified approbation of the officers and men.
In the first place the night chosen was un
suitable, being dark and rainy. Again, it
was the beginning of the week, and many
of the men were tired out with their day's
work. Again, many complain that six
hours' notice was given in which to turn
out in, and they claim that that is time
enough to enlist and thoroughly eqaip a
regiment.
It seems to be the opinion of the major
ity that emergency calls in the future
should be issued on Saturday night after
the men have concluded their week's
work, and that the men should be
marcbed out into the country and camped,
returning on Sunday. This would meet the
approval of all and would result in good at
tendance, as all are ambitious to improve
and tit themselve-i for active duty. Com
pany E, who are rapidly becoming the
crack company, turned over 90 per cent at
the emergency call. Company G did
nearly as well, but Troop B had a very
slim attendance, but little more than half
of the members being present; but this
can be nccounted for by the fact that the
men knew that their saddles were under
repair, and, considering the long-time no
tice given, were assured that it was only a
drill.
The emergency call has demonstrated
the fact that some system should be per
fected whereby the men could be notified
on shorter time. As it is, notification
must be made by word of mouih, and
there are many things which delay the
messengers. A larse number of the men
work in the railroad shops, and a pass has
to be obtained to enter the gate and get
word to them. This subject is now under
discussion by the officers ingeneral, and
ideas will be advauced which will be
brought up hereafter. One of the plans is
a certain call to be given by the Fire De
partment, another flags to be displayed at
certain points, etc. Troop B turned out
fifty-three strong at their regular drill
night. They were the only ones fully
equipped at (he last emergency call, as
they bad a day's provisions loaded in a
wagon with their tents, etc.
Captain T. B. Hali, ex-captain of Com
pany G, has been lying at death's door for
some time, but is now rapidly recovering.
He was >uffuring from heart trouble and
a complication of other ailments.
The Signal Corps established stations at
Auburn and Sacramento last Sunday and
signaled successfully, although the
atmosphere was rather murky. They had
picked out two stations which would have
made a straight range of ninety-two
miles, but changed their plans because of
the condition of the air. They will at
tempt the ninety-two-mile experiment a
week from Sunday and expect to establish
a record for the coast.
Those who went to Auburn Sunday
were Lieutenant Martin, Sergeant Wai
kins and Private Strachauer. The Sacra
mento station was conducted by Sergeants
Bailey aiÂ»d Howard Martin, with the re
mainder of the squad.
The corps will give their first annual

At the emergency call the corps turned

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1896.
with the exception of overcoats, blankets,
field glasses and telescopes, they wish to
make ttieir corps the champion of the
United States.
Already they have begun talking of
plans, one of which is in case of the ap
propriation of |80,000 passing the Legisla
ture for camping expenses, to establish a
line of stations daring one of the encamp
ments, and in conjunction with the rest
of the corps of the State, try signaling
from the Oregon to the Mexican lines.
This it successful will be the greatest
achievement of this method of smalmÂ«
MODESTO. Cal., Nov. 18.â The third
Sunday in every month is the day set
apart for the regular monthly company
target practice of Company D, Sixth
Infantry.
Last Sunday, November 15, being the
third Bunday, the company responded by
sending thirty men to the range, whose
average scores amounted to thirty, two
men falling below twenty, eight below
thirty, eighteen below forty, two over
forty and under forty-five.
The range occupied by the company at
the present time, although not the best
m the State, yet will compare with the
best.
Company D at last muster and inspec
tion ranked as one of the lowest in the
State â not from lack of proper material,
but from lack of interest That interest
which was lacking is being supplied Dy
the newly elected captain, D. W. Morris.
He is alive to the best interests of the
company. On regular drill-nights he is
first in the armory and last to leave. To
see the captain work for the advanoement
of the company one not knowing would
think he was receiving the pay of a cap
tain in the regular army.
Monday afternoon tne long-looked-for
emergency cali put in its appearance
through the Western Union office. The
sergeants were notified to have their
squads in the armory at 8 p. m.,
equipped in heavy matching order, and to
report absentees, where they were and the
bhortest and longest possible time it would
take to bring tnein together.
At 8 o'clock their reports were filed with
the company officers, which in brief are as
follows, summarized: Present, 30 officers,
non-commissioned officers ana privates.
Absent, 21 officers, non-commissioned offi
cers and privates who couid be cahed
lrom the fields where they are at work in
side of from one to live huurs' time. Ab
sent 5 who are outside of the regimental
boundary. Owing to the fatal lack of
blankets and overcoa's the company did
not leave town, as the weather looked
squally.
At iast inspection Company I) of the
Sixth was one of the lowest in figures of
merit. At next inspection the leaJiug
companies want to look "a leetie oudt."
There has been new fife and interest
stirred among the men, which is beinn
kej;t at fever heat by a rivalry among
them to excel each other in drilling and
shooting.
The expense for silver and bronze bars
will be increased next year, if present In
dications count for anything iv this com
pany.
MERCED, Cal., Nov. 18.â Captain
Graham received orders at 2 o'clock Mon
day afternoon to assemble his company
at tbe armory at 8 o'clock in the evening
in heavy marching order with tents and
one day's rations. While the order was
unexpected it had long beeu provided fur
as near as could be done in advance. Cap
tain Graham had previously laid out the
duty of each man in such an event, and
written directions for each department of
the work to be done were ready in the
office desk. The non-com ruis.-iuiied offi
cers were immediately notified, who, in
turn, warned their squads of the duty to
be performed.
From the nature of the order, and the
fact that the first brigade had taken the
field a few days before, it was supposed
that further orders would be received
which would send the boys into the field
for the night at least, but instead orders
were received to dismiss the company
after an inspection by Lieutenant Smith.
Upon the receipt of the original order, and
the notification of the non-commissioned
officers, a squad was put at work in tbe
armory packing tents and camp equipage
ready for a movement, anti rations were
broucht in from an adjoining provision
store. Another detail of men prepared
the haversacks, canteens, meatcans, tin
cups and blankets for issue to the men as
soon as they arrived. At 4 o'clock every
thing was ready to be moved, and at 8
o'clock forty-two out of the fi ty-one men
on the company's rolla were standing in
line in heavy marching' order, with twenty
five rounds ot ammunition in their ihirii
ble-belts awaiting further orders. Lieu
tenant Smith inspected the company, and
after a short drill it was dismissed.
The call gave Captain Graham an op
portunity that he was anxious fcr in order
to thoroughly test the arrangements he
had made for a sudden call and see what
flav.s there were in them or where im
provements could be made. It speaks
well for the captain and hi 3 assistant in
the arrangements that everything worked
so smoothly. Some of the men were at so
great a distance that they could not have
been reached in time for the assembly,
being at Fresno, Modesto, Watsonviile
and in the mountains. Two members
came in sixteen miles and two others
about twelve miles and reported for duty.
The company is well provided with blan
kets, but if it had been ordered into the
field for the night the men would have
suffered because of a lack of overcoats.
There are not a sufficient number belong
ing to the company to clothe the guard
on such an occasion as this.
Troop C Cavalry.
SALINAS, Cal., Nov. 20.â The emer
gency call sent to the National Guard of
Calilornia brought out Troop C in short
order, notwithstanding many of the mem
bers of Troop C live in the country several
miles and could not be reached by tele
phone or telegraph. Sixty members of
the troop oat of seventy-three members
were in line ready for marchine orders at
4P. M., Saturday. This, considering that
the telegraphic order did not reach Salinas
until nearly noon on Saturday, was rapid
work. Four members of the troop were
in San Francisco at the time and two over
fifty miles south, so that in reality only
seven members of the troop whom it was
po-sible to reach were not there, and these
seven were excused.
If every company of the National Guard
responded so promptly as Troop C ir
would not take long to prepare the citizen
soldiery for battle. The troop marched
rive miles into the country, the time re
quired on the march being exactly one
hour and fifteen minutes both going and
returning. The night was one of the worst
of the season, being very cold and windy,
yet the boys seemed to enjoy the novel ex
perience of life in camp. Tliey returned
to town at 1:15 p. m., Sunday. All the
commissioned officers of the troop were on
hand, and Captain Burke was more than
pleased with the showing made by the
troop.

WORKING FOR NEW
SUPERIOR COURTS
E P. Cole Will Present a
Bill to the Next
Legislature.
He Asserts That Attorneys and
Judges Favor an Increased
Judiciary.
Data to Be Submitted Showing the
Congested Condition of the
Court Calendars.
The most absorbing topic of conversa
tion amoug politicians and attorneys yes
terday was tne movement started some
days ago, as exclusively announced in
The Call, for an increase of the judiciary
in San Francisco. Many politicians were
surprised when they learned that a light
wouid be made at the next Legislature for
at leapt three new Superior Judges for this
City and Couuiy. They discussed the
probabilities, pro and con, from their own
points of view, but were completely at sea
as to the significance of the matter, not
knowing that the whole thing was in the
hands of several attorneys, whose only in
terest was to so increase the judiciary as
to guarantee prompt disposition of law
cases tbat now frequently run along for
months.
The Superior Judges themselves are fa
vorably disposed toward the proposed bill,
as they are overworked and protest they
cannot reach all the work before them.
Among the most ardent supporters of
the oia is Judge J. C, Hebbard, who has
mentioned the matter in court. Mr. Heg
eerty of Knignt <fc Heggerty, Garber,
Boait & Bishop, E. P. Cole, B. Healy and
other prominent lawyers are among those
who declare that a bill providing for three
to six new Superior Judges in this City
should be passed by the next Legislature.
It is no uncommon thing to hear their
protects against delay in the Superior
courts, which effectually bars the business
of their respective offices.
The bill will be introduced by E. P.
Cole, who has taken up tbe quest on with
a conviction that immediate relief in the
way of expediting court procedure is de
manded by local attorneys as an absolute
necessity.
"The calendars of the Superior courts
are so congested," said he, "that an attor
ney cannot get a case on trial for months
and months after it is at issue. In fact I
have had caÂ«es at issue since last April,
and cannot yet get a hearing.
"I have gone into this thing and shall
rarry it to the Legislature. The County
Clerk's office has promised to give me the
number of cases at issue, but which have
not yet been called for trial. One-half tne
cases at issue are not published on the
calei.dar of the Law Journal. And yet the
Superior Judges work very hard and have
done more work than any other Judges in
the Sta te.
"The delay on account of the congested
condition of the calender is very injurious
to litigants and of, course very d -trimental
to the business of attorneys. You go out
to court time and again and cannot get a
hearing â other cases are on trial, or there
is something else in the way.
"I will presents bill to tho Legislature
providing for an increase from twelve to
fifteen or eighteen Superior Judges. As
the conditions are three Judges would give
additional relief, but I think that six new
Judges would be necessary to keep the
calendar open."
"How did the movement for an increase
of Judges originate?" he was asked.
"I have thought of it for some time
past and told many lawyers oi m p
opinions. I find it meets the approval cf
a great many lawyers, though a few art
opposed to it. It is an injustice to the
people to compel them to wait bo long be
fore they get a determination of their
cases. Necessity originated tbe move for
an increase of the judiciary."
"Is any other lawyer working on the
bill?"
"I don't know what others are doing.
My opinion is that there is a general sen
timent in favor of the measure. I am
doing it for an increase of t c judiciary,
and for that only, acting disinterestedly,
without having in view any one to ele
vate. I cannot see how we can get along
without more Superior Judges. Los An
geles has six, Sacramento three. Oakland
four. There bas been an increase gener*
ally all through tbe State.
"San Francisco, which, I presume, nas
half the litigation of California, never had
an increase since the constitution of 1879
went into effeci, yet San Francisco is the
home of nearly all the big corporations of
California, and there has been a great in
crease in the population and Business
since 1579. The meusure is one for the
public benefit. Some of the civil depart
ments had recently to assist the criminal
Judges on account of the excess of busi
ness. Toe Judges cannot do any more
than they are doing. I've talked with a
good many lawyers, and they have fa
vored it.
"The bill will have plenty of backing,
for there will be any number of lawyers in
Sacramento to fieht for it. Its details. I
presume, will be arranged by the Judici
ary Committee if it is passed at all. Talk-
Ing about expense, the cost of three or six
extra Superior Jud.es to the people is
nothing when compared with the exnense
now imposed on people w o are trying to
get their cases tried in the courts, and suf
ler financially through unreasonable de
lays."
In Norway.
Rev. C. J. Larsen will lecture to-morrow
night at the Norwegian - Danish Church on
Tenth street, near Howard, on "Travels in
Norway." The lecture will be illustrated with
stereopticon views.

JIMMY CARROLL
BADLY INJURED
McAuliffe's Left Elbow Has
Paralyzed His Right
Arm.
His Hands Broken and He Is
Severely Bruised About
the Body.
Every Indication Tbat the Ex-Light-
Weights Fought the Best They
Knew How.
Jimmy Carroll is sick at heart and phy
sically sore.
These are facts not generally under
stood, because the belief has gone abroad
that Jimmy Carroll and Jack McAuhffe
gulled the public last Friday night with a
"fake right."
Carroll is suffering morally under that
implication, which even his Ion? career as
a "square" pugilist has not been able to
ward off.
Tbe different newspapers, in their ac
counts of the unsatisfactory ten-round go,
gave a pen portrayal of '.wo erstwhile good
men wbo had degenerated into over-fleshy
bag-pushers, and who varied their weak
p ysical efforts by holding a conversation
in the ring, the main topic being:
"Is it better for you, Jack, or is it bet
ter for me to to out? And in what round
shall we do it?"
Carroll feels terribly over this state of
affairs, and he consented yesterday to
give an explanation, as well as an illustra
tion, to a Call representative, showing
how. alter the third round of his fight, he
was in no condition to continue the battle
upon repularly accepted lines.
He was at the St. George's Clnb, sur
rounded by a dozen or more friends and
bis trainer, to whom ne was retelling the
details of the battle.
"see this left leg," Carroll said, after
doffine his shoe and stocking. "Do you
see that swelling and discoloration?" The
query was unnecessary to any man not
blind. The leg looked as if it had been
hit with a baseball bat. It was lumpy
and blue. '
"Before I went into the riner I strained
or parted a cord in there. " he said, "and
it was simply excruciating pain to stand.
I didn't say anything about that, how
ever, and went right ahead with the
fight."
Then Carroll began undressine to the
extreme degree that hi- friends might
witness for themselves the full extent of
the injuries with which he had met.
"Do you see those two knuctrles here?
Do you see those two knuckles there?" he
asked, first pointing to his left ana then
to his right hand.
The knuckles were out of sight. In
stead of being in their regular place they
were somewhere down the hand near the
wrist.
"I knocked those hands out of share in
the third round againat McAuliffe'shead,
and I kn w I was in for it. I couldn't
punch any more, and I knew 1 must hope
to win with a swinging blow, using my
forearm instead of my fist. I did this
with some success until the worst punish
ment I got in the whole fight beiell me.
I made a powerful swing with my right,
getting in close enough to land with my
wrist. McAuliffe closed in. too, and with
his elbow parried the blow. The point of
bi> leit elbow csug t me on the inside of
the right bicep and virtually paralyzed
tne whole arm. See the mark it left?"
Carroll showed an upper arm flear the
armpit that was swollen and frightfully
discolored over an area of twenty square
inches. He could not move tbe arm with
out terrific pain.
"That is the blow that did me up. My
right arm was of absolutely no use to me
alter that. It was just as if it was broken,"
he said. "I decided then ibat I must
force McAuliffe into doing tne work and
let him wb p himself. I could do no
punching, and I hoped to get him worked
out sufficiently Â»o win with a left swing.
Thos9 people who think that I did not
tight to win should look at me now.''
As Carroll turned around he presented
the appearance of something of a cross
between a blue-spotted leopard and a
black-striped zebra. There is little doubt
tnat he is a very badly punished fighter,
who will not be able to get around much
for many dxys.

sons narrowly escaped serious injury.
The building is an old structure. Satur
day evening's rain washed away ihe earth

began to sag. Persons passing the build

they did, as a large part of t c wall finally

DEATH OF A PIONEER.
Captain J. M. Vincent Expires in the
Mining District of Sinaloa,
Mexico.
The news reached this City yesterday of
the death of Captain j. M. Vincent in the
mining district of Sinaloa, Mexico. He
leaves a widow, four sons and a daughter,
all residents of this City.
He was reared and educated by Captain
Bartlett of New Bedford, Mass., and when
19 years of age was placed in command of
a whaler. After making several profitable
voyages he came to this City from Hono
lulu in 1850 and took an expedition of
100 miners up the coast in search of the
Trinidad Kiver. He was successful, and
on bis return bought the ship Judson,
which he sailed between this port and
Valparaiso, Chile. Finding the passenger
traffic profitable he purchased the Claren
don and did a large business.
During bis last trip information was
given by his rivals to the French officers
under Maximilian that the Clarendon had
on board munitions of war and provisions
for tbe Mexican lorces, and when the ves
sel arrived at San Bias she was seized and
her cargo confiscated.
Returning to this City Captain Vincent
retained an attorney to file a claim aeainst
the Mexican Government, but as years
passed and nothing was done he gave up
tne case as hopeless.
For a few years rast and up to the time
of his death he had been engaged in min
ing in the State ot Sinaloa, Mexico, where
he discovered two rich gold mines â the
Soledad and S n;a Apolonia â besides
locating seven others with good prospects.
About six months ago a company was be
ing organized in this City with the object
of developing these mines, when ex-Gov
ernor Johnson, who was at its head, died
and the scheme fell through.
SANDBAGGED AND ROBBED.
Rough Experience of John Hogan, a
Boatswain, at the Hands of Two
Boiler-Makers.
Ignatius Hurley and Patrick Sullivan
were booked at the City Prison yesterday
morning on the charge of robbery. Hur
ley is 17 years of age and Bullivan 21.
Both gave their occupation as a boiler
maker.
Friday night John Hogan, a boatswain
on the ship Glenericht, had been drink
ing heavily. He left a saloon on Folsom
street about 11 o'clock and was makinehis
way to Curtin's boarding-house on Main
street, wh n Hurley and Sullivan met
him. They struck him on the neck with
a sandbag, knocking him unconscious,
and robbed htm ot his gold watch and
chain.
Tbe robbery was reported to the- police
and Hurley and Sullivan were arrested
Saturday ni ht, one on Fremont street
and the other on Folsom street, by Police
men Roche, Murphy and Bean. Hogan
was found yesterlay mormnz by Police
man T. P. E.lis and taken to the City
Prison. Hurley and Sullivan were brought
before him along with six other prison
ers and he at once picked them out.
Hogan is disinclined to prosecute them.
He says after he recovered from the biow
with the sandbae Hurley and Sullivan
took him into a saloon and promised to
eive him back his watch in a few days if
he would say nothing about ir. The police
think tbat friends of the prisoners have
been talking to Hoean and threatening
htm. tie will be kept in prison on a
charge of drunkenness, ?o that he will
have a chance of swearing to a complaint
against his assailants this morning.

THE AGED ALL
WEPT FOR JOY
Pathetic Gathering of De
vout Christian Old .
Folk.
A " Love Feast " Where Eyes
Filled With Tears for Love
of God.
Venerable Members of Central Methc
dist Church Ccmmnne in
Happiness.
An assemblage where lips trembled and
â  gray-haired men and women sat, their
eyes brimming with tears that were
caused neither by sorrow nor pain, but by
the very pathos of their religious joy.
Such was the scene yesterday morning in
the assembly-room of the Central Meth
odist Church. It was a gathering of all
â¢ the old folk in the congregation, the
patriarchs and the aged matrons of the
church.
Three score of them were there and
mesÂ«: ges were read from many of the
more feeble who were deterred by illness
and the inclement weather.
The ceremony becan with what in the
Methodist churcn is known as a love feast.
Bits of bread and sips of water were par
taken of by all those present in token of a
feast in which they participated as spirits
inspired by a common love and reverence.
One little woman, ncr glasses blurred
with joyous tears, spoke of "these old sol
diers of the cross" and then added in
| tremulous voice, "I have not attended a
! Methodist love feast since I wa.s a girl in
dear old England, but I feel that I am
nearer to God to-day than ever before."
"I don't cry for sorrow" said a vener
j able man, "but I can't help it when my
I heart is full of joy," and every other eye in
j the room glistened with sympathetic tears
{ as the old man nobbed forth his thankful
ness and devotion.
An oider and feebler patriarch with fal
tering step and unsteady voice r se, and,
beginning in a low tone and rising to a
clear, strong avowal of his faith, declared
that ";or eighty-five years I never was a
I Christian; I never attended any church; I
followed no religion until a few weeks
ago. when I joined the church and turned
to God."
Among the older persons present were
Mrs. Hersey, aged 87; Mrs. Isaac Hilborn,
aged 86; John Eagles, aged 85; Uriah
Griffiths, ased 85, and Mrs. Patenghi,
aged 70.
The meeting was presided over by R.
T. Marrick, and H. S Jackson acted as
chorister. Rev. Dr. Dille and Rolla V.
Watt were present and delivered messages
from absent ones.
After the love feast the old persons ad
| j turned to the auditorium of the church
\ to listen to a sermon bearin : in part upon
tbe taithfulness of the veteran Christian.
The balconies, tbe choir rails and the
altar were decorated with large fan-palm
leaves, pepper branches and ivy, while the
altar itself represented a bountiful harvest
of moving green corn with russet tassels,
large pumpkins, bright, red chili peppers,
squashes, sheav.s of grain, pineapples and
I other fruits.
All the Methodist churche* of the City
I will unite their congregations on Thanks

GEORGE CHESHIRE
IS "ALL RIGHT"
That's What Mesmerist
Kennedy Says About
His Patient.
After Seven Days' Sleep, the
Fellow Left His Casket
and Danced.
Whether L Â£> geriennin or a Bona
Fide Affair, the Case Is Puzzling
the Physicians.
"You're all right !"
This must be given out with an intona
tion equal to the pop of a cork' from an
overheated champagne bottle, and it will
awaken the soundest kind of a sleeper bet
ter than a seven-day alarm clock.
Professor Kennedy proved that last
night at tbe Bush-street Theater.
One we k ago the mesmerist fondly
caressed George Cheshire with bis right
hand lefore an audience of several hun
dred people in the theater. He rubbed
bis eyes gently and tolo him he mu-t be a
good little man and go to sleep for a week,
just like mammas speak to their babies.
Cneshire immediately collapsed and was
put away in a glass casket, where be re
mained until his week was up. During
all that time he has been in sight of the
curiously inclined, who were given access
to the theater at all hours to observe the
changes in the man's condition.
There were unmnd people who would
jab pins in tne sleeping man without get
ting a squirm in return, and but for the
fact that Cheshire has lost a few pounds
and has gained some beard during his
ante-mortem burial, he was the same
George Cheshire last night when awak
ened that he was when he was put asleep
IS7 bours before.
He appeared to be slightly dazed. When
he closed h s peepers there wereâ say 400
people in the house. When ke opened
them the house was crowded from pit to
dome. It was a pay crowti, too, that
would have gladdened the heart of a
Patti impresario, and the inciease in
attendance, according to Cheshire's Im
pression, occurred in less than tive min
utes.
When Kennedy told him he was all
right he looked at the mesmerist with
that sort o. a glance that meant, "You're
a liar." He staggered about and came out
with the conventional "Wtiere am I?" In
another momet he realize i the situation,
laughed frankly and endeavored to back
up to the Â«eat he had occupied a week
before prior to being put asleep in the
casket.
If the man was acting a part it would be
advisable for some enterprising impre
sario to secure his services. Siill, there
were many people in the audience who
went away strong in their, impression
that they were gulled in right royal
fa-bion.
Dr. Plymire took Cheshire's pulse at 120
and his respiration at 19 just as non as he
was taken out of his :-even-day bed.
Shortly after and when the fellow was
awake his pulse dropped to 80.
It was desirable to weigh the living
corpse, and when he m-ijor part of the
audience was dismissed. Dr. Plyraire and
Cheshire led the way out of the hou*e.
They were banked on two sides by hun
dreds of people, and followed by hundreds
more. Not a soul in the crowd seeme Ito
know where scales were to be had.
Cheshire, however, who is not a working
man when he is not in a trance,
suggested that they go next door
to the theater. On one side there was a
vacant store and the other an open beer
saloon. Into the latter the motley gang
pushed to the delight of mine host, who
showed himself truly grateful to the star
of the occasion.
But scales were not there and Cheshire
suggested another saloon further down
the line. At this place the proprietor
greeted him with a hearty hand-shake,
saying: "George, you*bave done good, my
boy."
George thought so. too. But rounds
didn't seem to come quickly enough to
tne man with a seven days' thirst, and he
was agreeable to the suggestion that an
o her resort across the street be paid a
visit.
DOCTORS ON HYPNOTISM.
Local Medical Men Havp Various
Opinions on the Subject.
Boastful as doctors are about the accu
racy of medicine as a science, and careful
as they are regarding ethics and "up-to
date'' ideas, it is a strange circumstance
tust they are about equally divided in
opinion as to whether hypnotism is a
great fact of nature or a great achieve
ment in physiological legerdemain. ,
Among local physiciuns the great advo
cates of hypnotism as a truth too plain
for denial are Drs. Joseph O. Hirsch
felder. Dr. A. A. d'Ancona, Dr. Leo New
mark and Dr. J. Dennis Arnold. There
are many others, however, who deny hj p
notism, or at most guardedly admit that
"if it is a science it is embryonic." Such
is the opinion of Dr. T. C. Ma her.
Many strange stories are xold of Dr.
Hirschfelder's prowess as a hypnotist,
which great accomplishment has done
much to giv â¢ him a large practice. Dr. J.
8. Barrett, ex-autopsy surgeon, and one
of the most sudiousmen in local medi
cine, was formerly associated with Dr.
Hirschte der at a prominent hospital.
"I've seen half a dozen of his patients un
der hypnotic control at one time," said
Dr. Barrett yesterday, "and there is no
question that he is a ereat hypnotist and
that his power is aopiied in a scientific
way. The question of a trance or sleep is
a question oi evuience. One man mi^h:
lake a s umber and another be in one. If
a man can be made tosltepfive minutes
be might be for live hours, or longer. I
think a man truly hypnotized might sleep
a week if he could be properly fed."
Dr. Gerald Fitzgibbon, Dr. S. C. Bald
win aud Dr. John F. Morse had little to
say of the matter. Dr. Fitzgibbon said:
"I do not believe a thing in this hypnotic
business or in a mesmeric slumber or con
dition of semi-catalepsy. It is a good fairy
story."
Dr. W. Coffey said: "I think there is no
question that there is such a thing as hyp
notism and that there is the possibility of
a long hypnotic slumber. A man might
be kept alive on whisky and liquid foods
for a week or longer. I am not passing
any opinion on Kennedy's case, having
never seen the subject, but 1 am speaking
in a general way. 1 '
Dr. Coffey telis some marvelous tales of
the conduct of bis classmate, one Dr.
Steams, who has wonderful hypnotic
powers. "He used to call men up to his
office from the street," said Dr. Coffey,
"and put them into all kinds of atti
tudes.
"He was a wonderful wae as well. Once
he made a poor fellow, an entire stranger,
Dull off his clothes in his office and strike
out as if swimming for dear life."
Dr. A. A. d'Ancona startled a number
of nniversitv siuten s last year by hyp
notizing a long horeman and causing him
to repeat a long and intricate lecture on
the physiology of the nervous system. He
is professor of hypnotism in the State
University.

ANOTHER CHINESE
GIRL IS MISSING
Suie Gwok Fails to Return
Home With Her Little
Brother.
Went to Buy Fruit and Suddenly
Disappeared From the
Sidewalk.
Suie Ying Gwok, the 16-year-old daugh
ter of Chin Gwok, pan proprietor of a
restaurant at 810 Jackson street, is missing
from her home. She was the only daugh
ter of the restaurant- keeper, and her dis
appearance has caused the wildest excite
ment among the upper tet in Chinatown.
There is not the slightest clew to her
whereabouts.
Miss Suie and her little brother, Chin,
left the paternal roof last Saturday even
ing at 8 o'clock for the purpose of purchas
ing some fruit at a stand kept by a China
man on Washington street, a few doors
east of Dupont. The boy went up to the
fruitstand to make the purchase, leaving
his sister standing on the sidewalk. When
he turned to leave he missed his sister.
Thinking she had gone home, not caring
to remain out in the rain, he went home
and reported to his parents what had oc
curred. They shared the boy's theory
that the girl had returned alone and
would soon find her way home.
But as the time grew late with no ap
pearance ot the girl, the parents became
alarmei and notified some of their buh
dreds of cousins of their ioss.
Sea 1 eh was made for the girl in every
direction, but to no avail.
Additional efforts were made yesterday
morning, but without finding her. Then
Sergeant Anderson of the Chinatown
squad was notified, but so far has
not been able to finti her. No more clew
can be found than if the earth had opened
and swallowed her..
Tnrou h an interpreter her father stated
that she was born in China sixteen years
ago, but came to this City with her mother
seven years ago, and has remained at
home ever since. She had no visitors of
the raaie sex and never was permitted to
go ont on the streets alone. Sue always
had one of her brothers as a companion
He fears she was kidnaped by high
binders and taki-n to some place until an
opportunity presents for taking her out of
the City an l disposing of her in the man
ner usual to highbinders.
Detective Graham has been put on the
case by Chief Crowley, but he ha. discov
ered nothing yet. The detective does not
believe in the kidnaping theory, as at the
hour mentioned the streets of Chinatown
are crowded and it would be impossible to
kidnap a woman if she made the least re
sistance. He is of t-,e opinion thÂ«t some
