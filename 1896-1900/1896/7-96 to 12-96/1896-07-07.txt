Senator Hill's expressed desire is to be
gratified. The first fight between the sil
ver and sound money forces will occur on
the question of temporary organization of
the convention when Chairman Harrity
calls it to order at noon to-morrow. Ac
cordine to present appearances the prayer
is about the only part of the preliminary
proceedings which is likeiy to pasÃ un
challenged.
In no previous great National conven
tion has the recommendation of the duly
chosen National Committee in regard to
a temporary presiding officer been antago
nized by a minority report and a demand
for a vote, but the present gathering is an
exceptional one and is likely to break in
upon precedents in more respects than
one. By :* voie oi 27 t<> 23 the majority of
\h' | National Committee decided to recom
mend Senator David B. Hill as temporary
chairman ot the convention.
<". S. Thomas of Colorado gave notice
that a minority report would be presented
recommending the selection of Senator
John W. Daniel of Virginia, and that the
convention would be aakuJ to make a
choice between the two nominations. It
is a curious fact that at the Jast Demo- f
cratic Convention held in this city, during :
the memorable night session which re- j
suited in the nomination of Grover Cleve- |
land, Senator Daniel, with dauntless cour- I
age, faced for over an hour a hostile audi- !
ence as the especial champion of Senator j
Hili, the man to whom, by the irony of !
politics, he is now antagonized.
The method of proceeding to-morrow
will probably be as follows: When Mr.
Harrity calls the convention to order as
the representative of the National Com
mittee and recommends the selection of
Senator Hill as chairman, a minority
n'emberof the National Committee will
offer a substitute offering Senator Daniel.
Under all forms of parliamentary law a
c substitute must first be voted upon, and
the only open question in this case seems
to be whether or not Mr. Harrity will
recognize one of the silver associates for
the purpose of offering this substitute, the
convention not having been organized,
and no roll of the delegates having been
passed upon.
The silver men claim that thechairman's
ai-t in recommending a temporary chair
man for the approval ot the convention is
" an admission tnat the convention is quali
fied to act upon it. If this be true in the
one case, they assert that it must be so in
(he case of the substitute. Should Mr.
Harrity refuse to put the motion for the
adoption of the substitute, some silver
member of tne National Committee on
Platform will put the question himself, and
the skirmir-li between the nohJ and silver
factions will be precipitated.
O "I know very. little about the parlia
mentary status of the matter, 1 ' said Sen
ator Tillman to-night, "but I do claim to
be possessed ot a little common sense. I
know that Senator Daniel will be the tem
porary chairman of this convention and
that he will make the speech. If the goid
men think that their 300 vot.e.s form the
majority of this convention, just let them

try it. The silver men are running this t
iffair, and they propose to run it after \
their own fashion. If the gold men don't
like it, let them bolt. I hope they will."
During the early hour- of the day a con-
Bervative spirit seemed to pervade the
more radical of the silver men, and the de
sire was expressed by many to avoid if
possible a clash in the convention.
The conclusion of the committee to rec
ommend the selection of Senator Hill has
caused a sudden drop in this conservatism,
and the feeling between the two factions
of the party now seems to be more bitter
than before, if such a condition be pos
sible.
As to the probable choice of a Presiden
tial candidate to represent the free-coinage
platform, the day's developments have
met with no marked change in the situa
tion. Bland's friends are doing most of
the claiming and shouting. Efforts to get
the silver men to caucus on the nomina
tions in advance of the meeting of the
convention continue to meet with failure,
some of the prominent silver leaders de
claring their fears that the result of such
a caucus would be to create dissensions in
their ranks and aid the "gold bags" in
their efforts to disorganize them.
The California delegation appears to be
determined to present the name of Sena
tor White of that State despite the pro
tests of the Senator that he is not a can
didate and does not de: ire his name to be
considered. At the meeting of the dele
gation this afternoon the matter was dis
cussed, several delegates stating that they
believed the time would come in the con
test when the convention would torn to
Senator White as the only man upon
whom the contending deleeations could
unite. For this reason they proposed to
keep him as their candidate. Senator
White, who was present, entered an em-

HILL'S CRAFTY PLANNING.
It Cains Friends for the New Yorker
Among Some of the Sil
ver Men.
The Call's Headquarter?, i
Great Northern Hotel, v
Chicago, 111., July 6.)
The results of the crafty planning by
the mind of David Bennett Hill, of the
muttered conferences behind closed doors,
of the comings and goings of delegates to
and from the apartmeii!; el the man of \
the high forehead, the fruits of remaining j
away from church on Sun lay and doing |
politics instead of praying, have become I
apparent during the last twenty-four
hours. Among these results may be men
i tioned the fact that some of Governor Alt
. geld's Illinois delegates have had the
j temerity to express a preference for some
' candidate other than "Silver Dick," and
j the equally significant fact that a large
number of the silver men who had here
| tofore said: '"Get thee behind me, David,"
have talked with David in front of them
! and have gone away with the opinion that |
j David js a pretty good Democrat after all.
The big result is Senator Hill's selection
by the National Committee as temporary
chairman. Even Governor Alt^eld has
walked into the trap laid by the wily New
Yorkers, and has taken a sniff at the
toasted cheese on the bait hook. He no
longer regards Senator Hill with the dyna
mite eye of the anarchist. The whole aim
of Senator Hill's efforts is in the direction
of the defeat of any too pronounced silver
candidate for the first or second place, and
also to prevent the 16 to 1 ratio from Seine;
inserted in the platform. In the absence
of no bread he would be willing to take a
half-loaf in the shape of any mitigation in
that regard. It now appears that Hill's
absence from the gold meeting at the
Auditorium several evenings ago was de
liberate with malice and aforethought.
Some of the silver men with whom he has
been wrestling politically are saying that
Senator Hiil is not such a rabid goldbug
after all.
The Senator himself has given them to
understand that there is ground for this
opinion; that what he chietly desires is
the success of the Democratic party, and
that he does not wish to jeopardize it by
any too radical utterance in the platform
on the iinancial issue. He has pointed out
to them the danger of unnecessarily
estranging from the party the large pro
portion of the influence of sound money
Democrats in all parts of the United
States, and he has assured them that it
would give him the greatest pleasure and
that it would be the proudest work of his
life at this time to keep the party intact,
without taking away from the advocates of
free coinage any of the fruits of victory
which they could harvest in the conven
tion by the large majority of votes con
trolled by them. If the convention does
not revoke his appointment to-morrow he
will be given the vast power dwelling in
the intflligent gavel.
He has been so smooth-spoken in the
matter that ninny silverites who hud come
to Chicago with silver bricks on their
shouluers and foaming at the mouth gave
the Senator a respectful hearing in their
calmer mood. In this way he has made a
perceptible inroad into the radical faction
of the party and has even secured a hear
ing for his claims for the temporary chair
manship. The declination of that honor
by United States (Senator White of Cali
fornia, which declination was made after
Mr. Hill had several secret conferences
with prominent members of the California
delegation, removed the most serious ob
stacle from the pathway of the Senator
from New York. Jtie has this advantage
among all the turmoil and jarring of the
rival factions with respect to their favorite
candidates for the Presidency â that the
gold men are solidly united in the com
mon cause and that they have no favor
ites, the cause in their estimation being
higher than any men or number of men;
but after all this scheming and subtle
weaving of cunning webs I doubt whether
the wily Senator from New York will suc
ceed in his attempt to break down the 10
to 1 clause, which is really the life blood
of the present convention. But it is

Until Saturday night the area of the po
litical storm pressure was over lowa and
Missouri. The Boies and Bland pickets
boarded all incoming Western trains at
Omaha to pick off straggling delegates.
Nebraska was never so divided since the
Ogalalias and Omaha tribes scalped each
other before the Nebraska bill turned the
land over to their white successors.
On Saturday the Boies pickets informed
all political pilgrims that Bland was a
good man. but being a Catholic could
never be President. The same day Alt
geld's organ scratched Bland out of the
race because he is a Southerner.
Then rose a cyclonic yell that Altgeld
and Boies had combined, while thought
ful men wondered if out of this gathering
of the tribes that knew not Israel would
issue twin furies of sectionalism and re
ligious intolerance, against which Jeffer
sonian Democracy has canonized for near
a hundred years.
The scene in Chicago is wild beyond de
scription. Feud runs high. The ruling
spirits are the syndicate of Senators,
mostly Southern men, who are in charge
of the free-silver fight. Eighteen years
ago Samuel J. Tilden said to me that the
Democratic party would rally and elect
one man to the Presidency and pass away,
because that victory would bring the
South to the front and the public men of
that section could neither lead nor follow
wisely. Was it prophecy and are these
Southern Senators responsible for the re
vival of sectionalism even in the silver
ranks?
A listener in these crowds hears dis
quieting and imprudent talk of the poetic
justice of historic revenge of the West al
lied to the South against North and East,
as should have been in 1861, and thought
ful men reflect apon what would have hap
pened then and what may come now. But
the leaders of the South in 1861 lead here
now and ride down all opposition with a
hard hoof.
In constant consultation with Harris,
Vest, Morgan, Tillman and Daniel, Cock
rel, Jones and Berry are Stewart, New
lands, DuboiÃe, and Hartman, who form
erly rode in the Republican palace car, but
have recently been kicked off the brake
beam of that train, and are here as politi
cal tramps declaring Teller to De tht log
ical candidate of the Democracy.
Everybody asks, "What's the matter
wita the South? 1 '
The spirit of betrayal is so rampant
there that the National committee man
from Missouri who is assistant Attorney-
General at Washington, proposed to join
the silver force on the committee to de
prive Michigan of her chosen delegation.
Just sucn an offense was committed at the
Baltimore convention of 1848, which

MONTEREY, Cal., July 6.â There are
really two celebrations of the semi-centen
nial anniversary of the raising of the
Stars and Stripes in old Monterey. One is
by the descendants of the old Spaniards
and tne other is by the late comers â tha
Americans. But after all tt.ey are only
different ways of celebrating the same
event, and a? both sides are good-natured
the combination is a most successful one.
The Spanish element choose to cele
brate the event by the spoils of the past,
and they have decorated their houses
much as they would have done seventy
five years ago. On al! of the vacant lota
in the center of town establishments for
the barbecueing of meat have sprung up,
and dozens of expert cooks have been kept
busy all day turning the meat with pitch
forks over beds of glowing coals. The sa
vojy odor of well-cooked Deef falis the air.
The most fantastic establishments are
those for the manufacture and sale of
tamales, tortillas, enchellades and other
tiery combinations of red pepper, meat
and cornmeal. These places are all put
up for the occasion and are truly pictur
esque. Nearly all of them consist of
wooden framework covered with bougha
of evergreens. The green is out on so
generously as to almost, exclude the light,
so ttre interior looks like a cave. On the
inside there are rough wooden tables and
benches, and t tie floor is covered with
pine needles that fill the air with a sweet
odor as well as deaden the sound of foot
steps.
All day long crowds have filled the
places and enjoyed real old Spanish cook
ing. In a few places a specialty was made
of dishes prepared according to recipea
that have been preserved in families for
centuries.
In the exterior decoration of their
houses the Spanish have not forgotten
Uncle Sam. No matter what they may
use, it is only as an embellishment to the
red, white and blue. And they love the
red, white and blue. The girls, with their
brieht faces and dancing eyes, wear it on
their dresses and twine it among their
dark tresses.
There has been no chance for ennui to
day. From early morning the streets
have been filled with crowds of people on
pleasure bent and such life has never be
fore been seen in old Mont rev, not even
when the flap was raised over fifty yeara
ago. That is what many old men say
who in decades agone heard their mothers
tell of the great event that gave them a
new Government.
The pleasure seeking crowds first had
their attention attracted this morning
toward the two white warships out on the
bay. The beatintr of drums on the Phila
delphia told of preparations for the day's
festivities, and soon the shipy' boats were
seen heading toward the landing laden
with members of the white battalion.
From that hour the day was a continual
round of amusement. The crowd followed
the boys in white to Lyceum Park and
saw them drill and then followed them
back to the wharf.
By this time tne preparations for the
tire department contests were under way.
After tney were over the crowd again
turned its attention to the Lyceum Park2
ard witnessed a real wild-west show, given
by men who have spent their lives on the
ranges. There were many exciting events
:ind the crowd cheered and yelled to show
how ttie rare sport was enjoyed.
There was hardly an hour's respite for j
dinner before dancing commenced at the i
Pavilion and a dozen other places. The |
little boys and girls danced on the streets, |
and few, indeed, were the homes from
which the Bound of music did not come to
till the evening air with melody. it was a
gala night.
In the parade to-morrow Miss Florence
Schauilie will take the part of the coddess â 
of Monterey. She will be attirod in a
white robe and carry a large golden key I

capital being extended to the sister cities

SPORTS OF THE AFTERNOON.
Tournament of firemen and a Jteal Wild
JVest Shore, '
MONTEREY, Cal., July 6.âTo-day's
celebration of the jubilee was opened by
the sailors of the flagship Philadelphia.
They marched from the old wharf to Ly
ceum Park, where a largo crowd awaited
their coming, though the sailors were on
time with customary precision. The sailors
and their officers were in white service
suits and made a pretty showing, They
were accompanied by the flagship's marine
band of seventeen pieces.
After reaching the parade ground the
band played and the sailors gave an exhi
bition of battalion drill, riot-drill and
physical exercises.
In tte afternoan half the town and its
visitors packed Alvarado street to witness
the parade and tournament of the. lire
.men. This was an attractive and novel
'part of the programme. Watsonville was
represented by its lire laddies in blue
shirts and caps, with red and white trap
pines and gay badges. Gilroy's men had
open-front blue bhirts, the bosoms of
which were light red, and they were aljo
equipped with ornamental leather belts.
The San Juan team appeared in neat uni
forms and the Monterey men were in blue
full dress suits, withhold buttons and
pretty peaked caps, on which golden
trumpets were emblazoned.
The tournament was held under the di
rection of W. E. Parker, chief ;of the
Monterey fire department, who devoted
himself assiduously to the task he had
undertaken. From the point of view of a
fireman, as well as from that of a specta
tor, this feature was a decided success.
Two courses of 300 feet each were marked
off on Alvarado street. The book and
ladder course was nearer the old custom
house than the hosecart run. At one end
a rope was drawn tightly-from the tops of
opposite telegraph poles. The street was
cleared by ushers and then the rival teams
ran with their ladder-carts, in an exciting
dash that ended by some members of the
company snatching a ladder from the
truck as it passed beneath.
. Hardly had the ladder touched the
ground and rested against the rope before
>i nimble fireman ran to the top like an
acrobat, amid the shouts of the populace.
The hose companies started from oppo
site the celebration committee's headquar
ters. They had to run 300 yards, unroll
their hose, attach to a hydrant and get a
stream of water. In the former contest
time was counted from the snrt to the
moment the ladder was reached; the lat
ter ended when water first flashed through
the hose nozzle.
San Juan and Watsonville were entered
in the book and ladder contest. -San Juan
won; time, 48 seconds, against Watson
ville's 50 seconds.
The San Juan team includes: Frank
Black, George More, W. Stone, A. Moore,
Robert Flint, John Roach, f. Cul
len, Joe Castro, A. Castro, E. Churchill,
C. Stanford, A. Pierce, George Joseph,
Edward Pierce, Joe Martine, Joe Meranda,
Ben Flint (trainer).
Watsonville had the following team, but
â¢its defeat was due no doubt to the ab
sence of Maguns Oxen, who bad injured
himself at a former contest: Oscar Boub
(trainer), Wesley Carr, Thomas Baucaum,
Frank Lewis, Chris Nichols, Charles
'Wangaman, Thomas Warren, T. Maitland,
A. Da vine, Bert Lewis, N. Johnson, L.
Sindberjr, H. V. Tratton, James Owen,
Henry Ritchie, Manuel Romero.
The hose team contest was won by Mon
terey in 52 seconds against Gilroy's 54 2-5
and San Juan's 58 4-5 seconds. "Kimball
of the Gilroy team was too ill to enter,
and Vauehan was not in proper condition,
to which is attributed the loss of the cham

events of the day that commenced on time.

iuot;rt'.'-s crowds assembled at Lyceum
'ark ana the vaqueros were only too
i anxious to commence their work. From
the standpoint of the amount of excite
ment furnished, the sbow was a success,
but to the sensitive mind it was some
thing of an exhibition of brutality.
The bull fight was simply the torture of
a maddened creature, with its horns sawed
j off. Bat large numbers of the crowd cvi
! dently enjoyed the sport, for they cheered.
The calf riding and catching the greased
pig part ol the programme were harmless
i and amusing. The men had some good
; runs and tumbles and the animals were
i not hurt much.

Secretary Sheerin stated that the con
testants from Texas known as gold men
had withdrawn from the further contest
for seats in the convention. The with
drawal was accompanied by a statement
of the reasons which impelled them to
enter upon the contest and now to volun
tarily abandon it. This statement was
read by the secretary and made a part of
the records of the committee.
Senator Jones of Arkansas, representing
the "steering" committee of the Bimetal
lic League, was given an opportunity to
address tha committee. He stated that
the silver men had no candidate to present
for temporary chairman. The selection of
any one who was in accord with the idea
of silver would be acceptable to him, and
he urged in the interest of harmony that
the wishes of tne majority of the conven
tion be not antagonized in the choice. He
was heard with respectful attention, but
no answer was given him and he with
drew.
The committee decided to proceed with
the consideration and settlement of the
contested cases first, and that from Ne
vada was settled in favor of General Keat
ing and his associates, silver men, without
a vote.
In the cases over which a contest was
made fifteen minutes was given to each
side for argument. The tirst case of that
kind called was that of John P. Frenzel,
goid, against Charles M. Cooper, silver,
from the Seventh Indiana District. Mr.
Cooper made his own argument, while
ex-Attorney-General Green Smith spoke
for Mr. Frenzel. Cooper had been recog
nized by the State Convention of Indiana,
and he was placed on the temporary roll
by. a vote of 47 to 1, the negative vote
being cast by Mr. Campau of Michigan.
A contest brought by the silver men for
seats for three districts in Michigan was
argued for the contesting gold men by
Eiliot G. Stevenson, chairman of the gold
delegation, and for the silver men by Dan
iel J. Campau, the Michigan member ol
the National Committee. On motion of
Charles S. Thomas of Colorado the gold
men were placed on the temporary roll,
Mr. Campau's being the only vote cast for
the contestants.
D. J. Mahoney spoke for the contesting
gold delegates from Nebraska, headed by
Tobias Castor, and he warned the Demo
cratic party, through the National Com
mittee, of the dansrer tnere was before it
of defeat at the p 11s should it nominate
a Populist rather than a Democrat.

delegation, and by the first test vote of the
afternoon â 27 to L.J â it was decided to place
the Castor delegation on the temporary
roll.
Next came the Ohio contest â that from
the Eighteenth District â wherein John H.
Clark and A. M. Raff, gold men, sought
the places of Conrad Schweitzer and W. S.
Potts, silver men. The gold men had been
recognized by their district convention
and the silver men by the State Conven
tion, and the case was stated to the com
mittee by Mr. ClarC in person for himself
and Mr. Raff, and by John C. Welty for
the sliver men. The committee voted â
1!4 to 17 â to sustain the decision of the
State Convention and gave the silver men
a place on the roll.
A rather unexpected contest came up
from South Dakota, where a delegation of
silver men, headed by Dr. Ross, Bought to
secure the teats fortified by the State Con
vention to the delegation headed by Dele
gate P. M. Stover. It was a clear case of
silver against gold, but the committee de
cided without the formality of a ballot
and practically by a unanimous vote to
s?at the Stover or gold delegation. This
ended the contests for seats in the conven
tion, as far as the National Committee was
concerned. Mr. Bryan was somewhat sur
prised at the action in the Nebraska case,
having been lirmly of the opinion that the
gold men had no show. When the result
was announced be said to a reporter of the
United Press:
'Well, we received more than the silver
votes of the committee, anyhow, and will
be seated by the committee on crededtials
with question, becanse we have as clear a
right to a place in the convention as the
delegation of any State."
Ex-Postniaster-General Don M. Dickin
son was more than usually smiling and
complacent when the vote upon the Mich
igan contest was announced to him. "You
will notice," he remarked, "that Mr.
Campau's motion to seat the silver dele
gates received only his own vote and that
the motion to give the gold delegates their
seats was made by Charles S. Thomas, one
of the leading silver members of the Na
tional Committee."
"What will be done in the convention
about the matter." Mr. Dickinson was
asked. *
"Oh, that's immaterial â quite imma
terial," he replied airily, as he walked
away.
The committee then decided to recom
mend a temporary chairman of the con
vention, and, Mr. Clayton, one of the
delegates from Alabama, nominated for
that position Senator John W. Daniel of
Virginia. He spoke briefly in s-upport of
his nomination, urging the committee to
recognize the overwhelming majority in
favor of free silver that was known to ex
ist among the delegates at the convention,
and at tiie close of his remarks he was
loudly applauded.
Ex - Lieutenant- Governor Sheehan of
New \ork presented the name of Senator
David B. Hill, setting forth his capabili
ties as a presiding ollicer and his merits
as a Democrat.
No other candidates being named, the
committee proceeded to ballot, and Mr.
Hi il was chosen by a vote of 27 to Â£5. Mr.
Hill received the votes of the committee
men from the following States and Terri
tories: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,
Indiana, lowa, Kentucky, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Minneso;a, Mississippi,
Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oreiron, Pennsyl
vania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Ten
nessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington,
West Virginia, Wisconsin and Alaskaâ '27.
Committeemen from the following
States and Territories voted for Senator
Daniel: Alabama, Arkansas, California,
Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kan
sas, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada,
North Carolina, North Dakota, South
Carolina, Virginia, Wyoming, Arizona,
New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, Indian
Territory and the District of Colum
bia-23.
James JefFerics, the conimitteeman
from Louisiana, was r.ot recorded as vot
ing. His support had been expected by
the friends of Senator Hill.
After the result of the vote had been
announced the only exciting incident of
the afternoon occurred. Mr. Thomas of
Colorado rose and stated that he had been
assigned the unpleasant task of notifying
the committee in case the Senator from
New York was selected as the choice ol
the majority that a minority report would
be made and the name ot the Hon. John
W r . Daniel of Virginia would be presented
to the convention as a substitute. Mr.
Thomas said :
"The views of the Senator from New-
York on the currency question are at vari
ance with those of a majority uf the dele
gates to the convention. lie stands as
the representative of the Eastern gold
men. We have been informed by the
press that these men have sent delega
tions here to influence the action of the
convention, and statements nave been
made by these men in the press and at
public meetings which they nave held in
this city that they will agree to no com
promise and will spare no effort to accom
plish their ends. We would say to them
that the majority will accept no compro
mise and aiso will spare no effort to secure
their purpose, which is to name a man in
accord with their views. They don't de
sire to work in secret, but to fight in the
open, and therefore notify the iommittee
that a minority report will be presented
with the Hon. John W. Daniel named for
temporary chairman of the convention,
and they will ask that that deliberative
body be permitted to select a presiding
officer who is in accord with tbe views of
the majority."
In conclusion Mr. Thomas asked Chair
man Harrity, in view of the statement
that had been made, what kind of a recep
tion the silver men might expect to be ac
corded upon a motion to substitute the
minority for the majority report.
Mr. Harrity responded with promptness
and some feeling that such a reflection
upon the chairman as was implied in the
question wa3 not justified. He was only
tne organ of the committee and should en
deavor to discnarge the duties that were
incumbent upon him with absolute im
partiality and a strict regard for the rights
of the members. Mr. Thomas di-claimed
any intention to reflect in the slightest de
gree upon the chairman of the committee.
Ex-Lieutenant- Governor Sheehan fol
lowed Mr. Thomas in an impassioned
speech, which evoked applause at intervals
from the gold men on the committee. He
said:
"I recall that four years ago, sitting in
this very room, then as now members of
the Democratic National Committee, Mr.
Thomas and 1 labored and yoted side by
side to secure the nomination as tem
porary cnairman of the convention about
to assemble of tne Hon. William O. Owens
of Kentucky. Mr. Owens, as is well
known, was opposed to the nomination of
the man who, as developments after
proved, was the choice of an overwhelm
ing majority of that conventiou. We were
successful, too, as I remember, by about
the same vote as that by wbich the com
mittee to-day has determined to recom
mend the selection of the Senator from
New York, but I also remember there was
on that occasion no Democrat so disloyal
to the only existing National Democratic
organization as to even sugeest to the con
vention that it repudiate the judgment
and overturn tbe decision of the National
Committee. On the eve of the gathering
of the next National Convention such
action is that outlined in the declaration
of Mr. Thomas will establish a most dan
gerous precedent, and those who support
nim in tho attitude that he has assumed
must be responsible for whatever may
occur for which tneir acts may be taken as
an example."
Mr. Sheerin, secretary of the committee,
was named as temporary secretary of the
convention and John I. Martin sergeant
at-arms.
Tnis completed the business before the
committee and at 5:45 p. M. it. adjourned,
subject to the call of the chairman.
The moment the vote on the temporary
chairmanship was announced Don M.
Dickinson, who was in the committee
room, rushed out. tearing down the cor
ri ior to Senator Hill's room, which was at
the extreme end of the hall, and announced
the result. Mr. Hill received the news in
bis usual impassive way. Gathered in the
room at the time were ex-Secretary Whit
ney, former Governor Flower, Smith M.
Weed and others. All congratulated the
Senator on his selection. Mr. Whitney
and other gentlemen nad been waiting to
hear from the National Committee on the
temporary chairmanship question and on
the announcement of the result left the
Senator's room.
A United Press representative asked Mr.
Hill if he was satisfied with the vote.
"Oh," said the Senator, with a shrug of
his shoulders, "I don't care anything
about it; it makes no difference to me one
way or tne other."
"Will you prepare a speech as tempo
rary chairman?' was asked.
"Well, no," said Mr. Hill, "I don't think
I will, for divers reasons. What's the use
of preparing a speech; I may not have a
chance to deliver?"
"Do you think the convention will re
fuse to accept the National Committee's
recommendation?"
"I don't know. It is bard to tell what
the enemy will do under tde circumstan
ces. I am prepared lor anything that ia
possible to happen."

OHIO'S DELEGATION.
It Will Co Into the Convention
Practically Unpledged, but Mc-
Lean Is Favored.
CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â The Ohio dele
gation bad an important and interesting
meeting to-day, aud the upshot of it was
that the delegation will go into the con
vention practically unpledged, but with
an overwhelming majority in favor of the
candidacy of John 11. McLean. Trouble
was started by the introduction of a reso
lution by General E. B. Finley that tne
delegates be instructed to vote for Mc-
Lean as a unit. The resolution was de
bated bitterly for some time and Mr. Mc-
Lean was subjected to considerable criti
cism.
S. H. Holding of Cleveland led the at
tack and was joined by Barton Smith of
Toledo and L. A. Claypool of Springfield.
Mr. Smith made some remarks in opposi
tion to the unit rule, while Mr. Claypool
maintained that Mr. McLean's newspaper
haa not been 8 straight-out Democratic
journal; that Mr. McLean therefore was
not a good man to indorse. Friends of
Mr. McLean defended him warmly, but said
they were not particular about the adop
tion of the unit rule. All they wanted
was that the vote of Ohio should be cast
for him. Several of the gold men ex
pressed their intention of voting for Mr.
McLean and said their opposition was di
rected entirely against any attempt at gag
rule.
General Finley finally amended his reso
lation bo as to make it read that the Ohio
delegation should present Mr. McLean as
their candidate for President and request
ed all delegates to vote for vim. To this
proposition an amendment was offered
providing that the delegation cast its vote
for McLean, but tha: if his chances be
came hopeless individual members be per
mitted to vote for whom they pleased.
These propositions were vigorously de
bated. Mr. Patrick made a conciliatory
speech, in which he said that while I.c
would not have selected McLean as the
Ohio candidate, he would support him.
Ton L. Johnson said he was sorry that
the question of unit rule had been tip, but
admitted his willingness in the interest of
the party to bow to the wiil of the ma
jority. Ulrich Stone made a speech in de
:ense of ihe unit rule and lauded Mr. Mc-
Lean.
A motion was finally made that the
whole subject be laid on the table and this
was finally adopted after an agreement
that the delegation express its preference
for candidates by an informal vote. The
vote resulted as follows: McLean. 32:
Bland, 2; Carlisle, 1; Blackburn, 1; Patti
son, 1; no choice, 2.

Chicago, 111., July 6.)
The steering committee of the Demo
cratic National Bimetallic League had a
lively session to-day. It was a unit in fa
vor of directing the affairs of the National
Convention independent of the gold men.
While the meeting was in progress the
word was communicated to it that Hill
na<l been named by the National Commit
tee as temporary chairman of the conven
tion. Immediately it was decided that
the committee, which will represent
twenty-seven silver States in the conven
tion, should centralize its forces on Daniel
for chairman to-morrow. A vote was
taken, and all these States agreed to fight
Hill and the gold men to the bitter end.
It was also decided to unite on Harris of
Tennessee for permanent chairman.
The committee is to-night considering
the caucus proposition. Many of the sil
ver States are reticent about getting into
line, thougt the managers of Bland, Boies
and Matthews have practically agreed to
stand by the choice of a caucus. The com
mittee is voting on the question as 1 write.
The silver men are seemingly well or
ganized, and harmony prevails in the
ranks. There will be no surrender on
their part.
"We are going to turn Hill and Whitney
down," said Judge Powers of Utah to
night, "and run the convention in our
own way. This line of action was decided
upon by the steering committee at its
meeting this afternoon. The gold men
may bolt the convention, if they desire.
That is their privilege. The majority of
the delegates are for free silver, and if the
other fellows don't wan 1 , to get into the
band-wagon they needn't."
"This is a regular prairie fire," said
Barry Hillard of Idaho in discussing the
silver question with mo to-night, "and it
is going to sweep over the whole country.
The delegates from Idaho can:e unin
structed as to candidates, but will vote as
a unit on all questions coming before the
convention. We favor the candidates who
can best unite the silver forces."
Delegate Hillard is a native Californian.
He went to Idaho some ten years ago,
served with credit in the Territorial Legis
lature, and for several years past has
been Auditor and Recorder of Shoshone
County.
Senator W. H. Watt, chairman of the
Idaho delegation, told me to-night that
the delegates of Idaho, Utah, Wyoming,
Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Montana
and Nevada held a conference and decided
to act together on temporary organization
and other matters respecting silver su
premacy that might come before the con
vention.
"The object of the meeting," said Mr.
Watt, "was to get a consensus of opinion
of the delegates from the Rocky Mountain
States, and 1 am giad that there were no
di-sensions. We will go into the conven
tion hall to-morrow as one man, present
ing a solid front for the free and unlimited
coinage of silver at 16 to 1."
Mr. Watt is a prominent mining man of
the Wood Iflver section of Idaho and rep
resents Blame County in the State Senate.

SILVER REPRESENTATIVES.
They Hold Conferences to Devise j
Mean*? to Circumvent the
National Committee.
CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â A conference j
of the accredited representatives of free I
silver delegations assembled at the Sher
man House at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
They represented 400 votes. Senator Har
ris of Tennessee presided, with T. O-
Towlea of Missouri as secretary. After
much discussion Senator Tillman of South !
Carolina asked that the roll be called by
States to decide whether the silver men
should get together and name a slat" for
officers of the convention and for Presi
dent and Vice-President of the United
States to be supported in open conven
tion by all silver men. The vote on this
proposition stood ayes 11?, noes 80, unde
cided 220.
Previous to the vote and leading up to
it was a long and earnest debate. Gover
nor Tillman of South Carolina said it was
to his mind essential to present a firm
front and to accomplish this organization
must be held. The goldbugs were here
now trying to sow the seeds of disruption
and disorganization^and were sparing no
means in their power to do it. Tney were
playing on the vanity ot men by putting the
bee a-buzzing where, if the bee were lively,
it would oe the last place it would seek
honey. Yet its effect was even now felt
in the fact that the silver men hesitated
to take the lead and keep it.
Governor Altgeld of Illinois stated that
from what he understood yesterday no
silver conference could be held which
would include all tbe 600 and odd silver
delegates in the convention. Neverthe
less if such a conference seemed to those
present wise and prudent Illinois would
be found acting in concert to promote the
silver cause.
Illinois had no candidate to present and
was hampered in no way which could in
terfere with her giving her best efforts to
nominate a candidate upon a platform
tuat would command a majority of tbe
votes of the people of the North. Still, he
thought there might be something in a
conference of so many as 600 men with no
rules to guide them, and unless all speeches
were eliminated and they simply came
down to voting on propositions and men
tbe conference might find at its close thfit
it left them less united than at tbe be
ginning,
Mr. O'Donnell of Colorado reiterated
his remarks of last Friday night that it
was necessary for the silver men to get
together bo that the goldbugs of the Ens.
could not throw their 300 votes in a body
to some silver man less objectionable to
the goldbugs and thus nominate him.
Such a man nominated in such a way, he
declared, could not carry Colorado.
Without taking any action, but with the
understanding that eac:i of the delegates
present would endeavor to jjet in touch
with his delegation and ascertain if any
changes had taken place, the conference
adjourned to meet again later.
The event of the evening was a confer
ence of silver men at the Snerman House,
with the view of determining upon a line
of procedure to defeat the National Com
mittee in the event ihtt it sought to pre
vent the name of a silver man being pre
sented in to-morrow's convention as tem
porary chairman.
Tho conference was called for 9 o'clock
and was to consist of one member from
each State having a silver delegation or
silver representaaves. The members were
slow in arriving and "whips" were sent
out. It was explained to those who hesi
tated that there was but one set purpose
before the conference â to outwit the Na
tional Committee â and names of candi
dates would not be touched upon.
After a snort recess the conference re
assembled at 11 o'clock and a revised
count was made of the vote which could
be relied on to support the substi'.ution of
Senator Daniel's name for that of Senator
Hili. The total of votes spoken for was
574, with 16 more expected before the con
vention is called to order, mating 590 for
the silver men's temporary chairman. It
was arranged that Senator Jones, who
presided at the conference, should make
the motion in convention substituting
Senator Daniel. A resolution by Senator
Jones was adopted calling upon all silver i
delegates to be in their seats by 11:30 to- I
morrow.
The conference at midnight adjourned
until to-morrow at 9 o'clock.

Washington Delegates Do Not
Relish His Conduct In
Voting for Hill.
CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â A meeting of
the delegation of the State of Washington
j was held to-day with the following result:
I William 11. White was elected chairman;
i R. C. MeCroskey, resolutions; J. E. Fen
j ton, permanent organization; J. L. Sharp-
Btein, rules; Thomas Maloney, creden
tials; J. F. Girton to notify President and
I Vice- President.
Hugh Wallace, the present National
Committeeman, was re-elected by a vote
of five to three, Messrs. White, Fenton
and Darling voting against him. After
i the meeting Mr. White, thfl chairman of
tbe delegation, denounced the action of
the delegates and stated that Mr. "Wallace, |
beins a gold man, was not in accord with
the monetary views of the delegation, and
I the silver men who voted for him would
meet with a warm reception upon tneir
arrival home.
Prior to the meeting of the National j
j Committee this morning a petition signed I
by live silver men out of the eight was pra- I
) sented to Mr. Wallace requesting that he, j
I io accordance with the expressed desire of
I the Washington Democratic State Conven
tion which elected him on a silver plat-
I form, should vote in accordance with tbe
I sentiments of lm constituents and vote in
the National Committee for a silver man j
for temporary chairman. Mr. Wallace dis
regarded the request and voted for Hill,
but subsequently at the meeting of the
delegation he was re-elected National
Committeeman.

CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â The National
Committee of the American Silver Organ

event that he cannot be nominated the

Chicago, 111., July 6 )
The National Committee to-day agreed
on David Bennett Hill of New York as
temporary chairman of the Democratic
convention by a vote of twenty-seven to
twenty-three. This action of the com
mittee will probably be repudiated by the
silver Democrats in the convention to
â â¢v. They are simply desperate.
Though Hill has made overtures to meet
them Lali way on the financial issue, he is
now more than ever an obiect of distrust.
Still there is a possibility of the silver
ites smothering their feelings and allow
ing the New Yorker to till the chair pro
tern. This question, however, can be only
decided in the convention to-morrow. The
silverites were amazed to find Texas, Miss
issippi, Tennessee and Alaska in ti.e gold
column when the committee voted on the
temporary c airmanship to-day. These
are the sources from which Hill gathered
in a majority as a result of the committee
meeting. The gold men are to-night a
little more contident. and the silverites are
angry with the Dreak in the solid South.
The National Committee was in session
all day at the Paimer House. It was a
moi-t spirited gathering, and the proceed
ings were conducted privately. The sound
of loud voices, however, issued from the
council chamber and hungry crowds with
out eagerly listened for some sentiment to
soothe their excited dispositions. It was
not until late in the afternoon that a vote
on the temporary chairmanship was taken,
and when tiie result was announced to tne
waiting newspaper reporters and the word
passed to different political centers great
excitement followed.
With Hill as temporary chairman the
plan of the gold men is to prolong the
convention, as they feel that their only
hope lies in the disunion that would fol
low a protracted meeting with the Demo
cratic temperament at fever heat, when they
might be enabled to defeat the silverites
in tne end. The silver lorces. led by Gov
ernor Altgeid of Illinois, Governor Stone
of Missouri, Senator Jones of Arkansas
and Senator Daniel of Virginia, are anx
ious to have the business of the conven
tion rushed through with as little delay as
possible.
The situation as regards candidates is
unchanged. Bland is still leading with a
handsome majority. Boies is trailing
along close behind,' and Teller is very
much in evidence. It Is not believed, how
ever, that the latter can possibly secure
the nomination. Matthews of Indiana
has added no strength to vis candidacy,
while McLean of Ohio is esteemed only as
a Vice-Presidential possibility. Pattison
of Pennsylvania is still in tbe race. His
friends are trying to have the delegates
from the Eastern States combine upon
him. Neither Tiliman nor Blackburn has
gained or lost ground.
Senator White will not allow California
to : resent his name to the convention.
Pennoyer of Oregon is now out for second
place on the National ticket. Sit friends
are making an energetic fight for him.
While the Western delegates recognize
bis splendid abilities they prefer a can
didate with a large sack and a disposition
to open it.
\Vhile the Bland men claim tbat they
will have sufficient votes to nominate him
for the Presidency it seems to me that it
ia everybody's race, with such a large
number of candidates in tne field and wiih
.irty divided on the financial problem
there is no knowing what the outcome
nay be. As 1 survey the field to-night it
certainly looks as though a great crisis
confronts the National Democracy. It
may inspire a superior statesmanship. It
niay forever obliterate the party.

SILVER'S TIDE RISING.
Straddlers That Went to Chicago
From the East Clamor to Get
Into the Lifeboat.
CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â The silver tide
is jna<iuailj rising. It has virtually sub
merged the* ultra gold men. The few

[Sketched from life for "The Call" by J. Kahler.]
i
straddlers that came to Chicago from the
Eastern States are now clamoring to get
in the silver lifeboat, and the probabilities
are that the National Democracy will this
week pass into history as a great revolu- ;
tionary factor in the currency of the
country.
The fact is that the sentiment in favor
of the free coinage of silver is increasing j
in volume as the minutes pabs. The j
country at large is watching with inces- j
sant eagerness the drift of opinion of the :
Democratic epoch-makers now gathered
in National convention in this city.
The wires are burning with messages to
delegates from the different States, com- i
ing as they do from private and public
sources, urging tiÂ»em to loyally uphold the
promise* made to their respective con- |
stituencies. The gold men of the East are
being constantly urged not to retire from
the fieid, as their surrender would be ac- j
cepted by tbe country as an indication of !
the reasonableness of the bimetallic doc
trine. On the other hand, the silver mis
sioiiaries are encouraged by cheering mes
sages from afar, and thus inspired anew
they are sealing the walls of the enemy's :
fortress, and the indications are that be- |
fore another day it will have captured its j
guns. Tiie leaders of the gold faction con
cede all this. They are not slow to realize
! that the day has been lost.
There is nothing left for them to do but
i to bolt the convention or retire from the !
! position they have taken on the hnancial
question and accept the doctrine of Ui to 1. j
; A bolt by the gold men up to to-day had '
I been considered not improbable. There is
i now some hope of a compromise. Senator !
J Hill is tryine to bring it about. His con
i ference with Governor Altgeld was sig
nificant. It was accepted by the silverites j
as a concession of weakness on the part of i
the New York leaders. It is not thought '
probable that Hill will give way suffi
ciently to bring about a reunion of the
party. While it is believed that he will
j accept a platform declaring for the free
! coinage of silver the ratio of 16 to 1 is
obnoxious to him. Nothing short of this,
however, will satisfy the silver men, and,
as they are the controlling element of the
convention, they will not recede from the
stand taken.
Sixteen to one is their religion. Senator
Hill is looked upon by the Democracy as a
trimmer. He is now flirting with the
silver wing of the party whiie Tammany
is outspoke.il to the effect that it will sup
j port the ticket regardless of the platform
and nominee. Whitney continues to sulk in
his tent. He is not the Whitney of four
years ago when he acted as the whip of
President Cleveland, and succeeded \n
forcing his nomination against tbe vigor
ous protestations of New York. On that
occasion he was supported by a solid
! South and West. Now he is opposed by
I that same strong and united element. The
j situation of tbe last Democratic National
| Convention has indeed been reversed.
Whitney's voice is to-day unheeded in the
councils of his party. Frank McGuihe.
TO LEVEL THE HILL
[Continued from first Page.\
mighty interesting to catch him trying
do it.
With the elimination of Senator White
from the held of action in any capacity
other than that of a dark horse the situa
tion stands precisely as was stated in The
Call a week ago; that is to say, Bland of
Missouri in the lead, with Boies a close
second and the rest scattering. All the
convolutions of political workings and
schemes during ten days of the most
active plotting and planning have failed
to change the status.
I asked Congressman Maguire of Cali
fornia how the delegation stood for Presi
dent, and he replied that if a vote were to
be taken now Bland would be in the lead,
with the remainder of the delegation di
vided and with no particular choice.
James V. Coleman was asked the same
question, and he replied that tbe only
members of the delegation who were
working for Bland were Congressman
Maguire and Caminetti; that the rest of
the delegation had no candidate at all.
"By the way," asked Mr. Coleman, "who
has put up Governor Altgeld as the man
ager of thisconvention? By whatauthority
does he presume to dictate and Jay out
programmes? I nave been trying to find
out since I have been here, but I have not
been able to learn what power is behind
the Governor of Illinois. He certainly
has not the California delegation."
E. E. Leak, Commissioner of Public
J Works for California, said that he was a
i gold man, but that while be had not been
I instructed by the district convention
! which had selected him as a delegate, be
I ieJt bound in honor by the platform
adopted by the State Convention.
"How many gold men are there in tbe
delegation?" I asked.
"There are, I should say, one-half of the
delegation whoj^ersonaily as individuals
are in favor of sound money, but they will
vote for silver under their instructions."
"In other words," I suggested, "they
will vote against their consciences, against
their better judgment."
"Yes to a certain extent."
Mr. Coleman in a subsequent conversa
tion said that he did not think that Dick
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 7, 1596.
Bland would get the nomination for the
Presidency. There would be a good many
combinations, and if it came to a decisive
stage the supporters of all the other can
, didates in the field would combine against
him. Mr. Coleman added that Senator
White would have a very good chance of
getting the nomination in such a contin
| gency, but that the Senator would not al
\ low his name to be used.
The headquarters of the California dele
j gation were open to-day as were also sev
eral cases of wine. A long table was
spread at one end of the handsomely
furnished parlor and two smiling colored
1 men under the direction of Delegate T. T.
[ 1 .me served all comers with Shasta water,
; Haut Sauterne, Zinfandel and Burgundy.
! It would be needless to say, if I did not
prefer to say it, that the California head
; quarters are the most popular in the city.
j Colonel John P. Irish appeared at the del
â  gation headquarters with a lurid light in
j hia usually calm ultramarine eyes. He
; remarked that he was going to make the
fur By in certain unrucntionea quarters
and from my knowledge of the colonel's
j ability both with pen and tongue I have
| no doubt that a real roasting cyclone will
strike the Democratic camp somewhere
amidships.
Outside of New \ork there appears to be
more energy concentrated in the Califor
nia delegation than in any other with
â¢ which I have come in contact. Make a
j composite picture of M. F. Tarpey, Senator
i White, John P. Irish. Congressman Ma
guire and W. W. Foote and you have
about as stubborn and as pushing and as
' hard-pulling a tug-of-war team as you
could tind anywhere. Tha California dele
gation on this occasion, by not being
I pledged to any particular candidate, may
be able to make itself heard to good ad
vantage in its National council, for it
! surely has the right kind of material.
The crowding stage of the convention
week was initiated to-day. It was difli
| cult (or a person to make way against trie
j turbulent tide of humanity that ebbed
j and flowed north and south on State street,
and that whirled and eddied and piled up
a great delta of human driftwood in front
of the entrance fo the Palmer House. It
was almost as much as a man's pocket
: book was worth to throw himself in the
| midst of this mass and be slowly pressed
i in3ide, where be could see nothing but
! tobacco smoke and hear nothing but noise.
j Bands heading the arriving delegations
I during the day make it a point to blow
! their wa}* in with their instruments
I through this viscid, sluggish mass of
; political deoravity and taking their stand
| in the middle of the lobby to play patri
| otic airs and drown the arguments of the
loud-voiced men wrangling over the finan
cial question.
While I was in the midst of the snffocat
i ing crowd this afternoon the band was
playing the stirring strains of "The Red,
I White and Blue." During a pause in the
music a man from Pike County, Missouri,
shouted "Give us 'Dixie. 1 " The band at
once strunk up that soul-stirring air so
reminiscent of the cotton fields, the moon
lit river glimmering among the rushes and
the sound of the banjo and the song of the
happy darky in the good and the bad days
of long ago.
In a little entresol, the balcony of which
overlooks the clerk's desk, are gathered a
, crowd, mostly of women spectators, occu
pants of the hotel, who perspire and till
! their lungs with tobacco smoke and dust
| for hours and hours at a stretch watching
i the silver cranks wrangling on the floor
below and listening to the music of the
bands as they lead the delegates into the
; hall.
To-morrow Governor Altgeld will show
the Democracy into the Coliseum corral
and will brand the letter "A" upon the
; National Democracy if Chairman Hill
j gives him the least opportunity.

Plenty of Tried and True Candi
dates In the Field for the
Presidency.
CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â Benator Stew-
art of Nevada, speaking to a United Press
representative to-day on the situation,
said:
"I find delegates generally discussing
i how they can secure the combined votes
j of Democrats, Populists and silver Reoub-
I licans. It is generally conceded that, all
j parties would vote for Teller and that his
nomination would secure success. But
! many of them have their own candidates
who have been faithful free-ailverites, and
they cannot see why everybody should not
vote for their favorite. There are a large
number of good and tried men in the
I field, any one of whom ought to satisfy
; gold adherents. However, the paramount
: desire for victory is so great that it seems
! probable at this time that party prejudice
will be buried and that there will be a
union upon a representative man of ail
the parties interested, and that the man
j selected will lead to victory."
Bryan Has Hopes.
CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â Ex-Represent
ative Bryan of Nebraska thinks the action
of the National Committee recommending

will be settled in favor "f thp silver dele

vention.

Chicago, 111., July 6. j
This has been a busy and exciting day.
Delegations representing Bland, Boies,
Blackburn, Matthews, Pattison and Teller
have been flitting from hotel to hotel pre
senting the records and the strong points
in favor of tlieir several candidates. Rep
resentatives of all these candidates visited
the California headquarters to-day and
made such strong showings for their
favorites that while they may not have
aided our choice they have at least stimu
lated, our party pride. Much as we
honored our leaders we did not previously
realize how grand a galaxy of statesmen
we had to choose from.
Bland is still in the lead and ia gaining |
strength. To-day the Illinois delegation |
pledged him its solid support. I saw ex- j
Congressman Fithian of Illinois just after |
this action was taken and he said emphati- I
cally that Bland can carry Illinois and
that with any other candidate the State
will be doubtful. He says that Boies can
not carry Illinois.
The Teller mo vcment is still strong, but i
it is not to strong as it was on Saturday. '
Bland is drawing from Teller's supporters.
The argument that Bland is as good and
as reliable a silver man as Teller; tliat fel
ler and his followers, having failed in the
Republican party to get a silver platform,
should not now ask the Democratic Con
vention not oiily for a favorable platform,
but also for the candidate, are having their
effect and will probably prevail.
Boies is handicapped to-day by the ap
pearance of Joun Boyd â Mr. Huntington's
shadow â to solemnly assure delegates
that, in his opinion, Boies would make an
ideal President. Poor Boies! What
secret treason has brought down upon
him, in this evil hour, the friendship of
such public enemies? The Boies commit
tee, however, made an excellent impres
sion on our delegation.
Matthews' u'fcht is quiet and dignified.
It is what may be called a waiting fight.
If the tiorce. ntrugele amonc the leading
candidates should end in the failure of all
of them he will occupy an admirable posi
tion. He is an uncompromising silver man,
with a most excellent record on that and
on all other public questions.
Pattison has a splendid record, but he
cannot be nominated because of his hos
tile or, at least, uncertain position on sil
ver.
The fight between the silver and gold
forces will be precipitated at the verf open
ing of the convention to-morrow. The ma
jority of the National Committee has
ohosati to provoke the contest by insisting
upon presenting the name of Senator Hill
for temporary chairman. The minority
will present the name of either Senator
Daniel or ex-Congressman Bryan.
Our delegation to-day decided to vote as
a unit for the candidate of the majority.
It is said to-night that the gold men are
offering votes to Boies in exchange #or
votes for Hiil. If the Boies men should
vote for Hill it would be regarded as trea
son by the silver men.
The California delegation was in session
for nearly four hours to-day. Joseph J.
Dwyer was elected National Committee
man. Senator White was selected to rep
resent the State on the committee on plat
form and resolutions. Mr. Maguire on rules
and order of business, Mr. Burke on cre
dentials, Mr. Coleman on organization and
Mr. Caminetti on notification of President
and Vice-President. Mr. Church was
named for State vice-president of the con
vention and Mr. Wise for assistant secre
tary of the convention.
Ex-Congressman Caminetti called atten
tion to the fact that the last State Conven
tion had instructed the delegation to use
all honorable means to secure in the Na
tional platform a resolution in opposition
to the refunding of the Pucific railroads
debt. He said that the question was
National in its character and results; that
a Democratic House of Representatives
had defeated the Reilly bill; that a like
measure, the Powers bill, is now pending
in the House of Representatives, and that
it would be proper for the National Con
vention to indorse the action of the Fifty
third Congress ia defeating the measure
and to pledge the party to oppose the
scheme.
Each member of the delegation agreed
to make a personal effort with the mem
bers of the committee on resolutions to
secure the adoption of such a plank. No
action was taken on the question of agree
ing on a candidate for President, and it is
probable that no such action will be taken
until after the iirst ballot for President.
P. Burke, R. P. Troy, Mr. Hirshbergand
other visiting Democrats were selected as
alternates to fill the places of those who
are absent.
The California headquarters are quite
popular and the yoang men of the delega
tion are excellent hosts.

CHICAGO, 111.. July 6.â There was
something approaching a scene in the
Tennessee delegation meeting this morn
ing. Senator Cockrell of Missouri pre
sented Bland's claims, and ex-Senator
Patrick Walsh of Georgia championed
Hoies. Tue delegates from Tennessee
were understood to be equally divided as
to the merits of these candidates.
In tbe course of the discussion Governor
O. H. FARRES, THE ORIGINAL BLAND BOOMER AND PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE
OF "SILVER DICK" AT THE CHICAGO CONVENTION.
[Sketched frovi life in Chicago for "The Call" by J. Kahler.]
Boies' recently published letter was read,
in which he advocated unlimited coinage,
but limited legal tender for the American
silver product.
This aroused the ire of Senator Harris,
and in the emphatic language for which
he is noted, he condemned the action of
Boies as more than foolish. He was sur
prised tbat a man like Boies should advo
cate the policy credited to him, a policy so
eutirely at variance with the wishes and
desires of the silver wing of the party.
It did not mitigate the wrath of Senator
Harris to be informed that the position
was a compromise, suggested a longtime
ago to meet a situation that did not now
exist. Still, he expressed his belief that
Boies is the most available man. This
severe criticism of his own candidate by
Mr. Harris weakened some of the other
delegates who had been inclined toward
Boies and, it is said, somewhat weakened
his chances and increased those of Bland.
No action was taken, the understanding
being that the delegation should meet
again to settle the question of a candi
date. The delegation is bound Dy the
unit rule and the struggle promises to be
interesting.
The Wyoming delegates passed resolu
tions favoring a tariff for revenue only,
free silver, and declared themselves for
Bland.
The Texas men had a little row over the
question of the temporary chairmanship
of the convention, some of the delegates
wanting to pass a resolution for Bryan,
but it raised so much opposition that it
was tabled.
The Texas delegates finally indorsed the
candidacy of I'.iand for President and se
lected Congressman J. W. Bailey to sec
ond Mr. Blanu's nomination.
The Missouri men feel so positive of
Bland's nomination that at the caucus
this morning it was decided not to elect a
National Committeeraan, but to leave the
place open until after the convention,
whon they propose to permit Bland to se
lect a man agreeable to nim.

unit rule as to their candidate and plat
form. The motion was carried by a ma
jority of one. The delegation is in entire

what he termed a plain talk on the finan

by a vote of 10 to 11. It is not thought
this is an accurate test of the strength of
the silver men in the delegation, but it is
admitted that at lf>ast four of the thirty

Senator Hill was unable to be present at
the organization, but the other delegates
at large were there and nearly every mem
ber of the delegation. Mr. Whitney was
there for a short time, but as he had othar
work to do He withdrew early. William
F. Sheehan told what the National com
mittee had done to-day, and described the
scene that took place when Daniei was de
feated by Hill for temporary chairman.
Smith M. Weed made some remarks
laudatory of the work accomplished by
the advance guard of New York gold men
who had come to Chicago last Friday. It
was decided to assess each delegate $25 for
the expenses of the delegation, and a big
pile of money soon accumulated on the
desk of the presiding otiicer. Congressman
Sulzer, who represents the eleventh dis

TAMMANY ARRIVES.
Two- Hundred and Thirty Braves
Enter the City Without
Ostentation. .
CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â Tammany ar- !
rived in Chicago this morning, 230 strong.
The delegation came in two sectionsâ one
over the ; Michigan Central and the other
over the Lake Shore. They did not march
from the station to the Auditorium, where
they will have quarters, but proceeded {
quietly and unostentatiously to that hotel.
They are making little noise and are not
attempting to attract attention by wearing
any conspicuous uniforms or securing tbe
services of a brass band. This is in marked
and noticeable contrast with their habits
of previous years.
WESTERN DELEGATES MEET
Favor Senator Danlel for Tem
porary Chairman and Dis
cuss Teller.
CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â There was a
conlerence to-night in Colorado's head
quarters of delegates from the Rocky
Mountain States, Utah, Nevada, Idaho,
New Mexico, Wyoming and Colorado be
ine represented. It was agreed that the
minority report of the National Commit
tee naming Senator Daniel for temporary
chairman be supnorted, and that the ad
mission of Territories a- Ptatas be advo
cated. It was also decided that the dele
gates support the restoration of the old'
"territorial representation of six in Na
tional Conventions. There was an infor
mal talk on candidates for the Presiden
tial nomination, and some efforts were
made to secure a united support for Teller.
This proposition did not entirely meet the
views of all those present, and no action
was taken.
A CUBAN PLANK.

CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â The following

and to-morrow it will be presented to the

the repeated imprisonment of American citi
zens, without due process of law, the annihila
tion of American commerce, the frequent
alarms on our coast and the constant menace
to our peace, impose upon the Government of
the United States the duty of restoring order
in Cuba.
We therefore favor the prompt interposition
of our Government, end believe a Government
satisfactory to the (Juban people should be
established as a guarantee of permanent peace.
It is stronger than the plank adopted at
St. Louis, which only calls for the friendly
offices of the Government. Ex-Speaker
Sulzer of the New York Assembly, one of
the delegates from that- State, has added a
paragraph 10 the plank calling for the
recognition of the Cubans' belligerency,
but that is believed by the Cuban plank
custodians to be inconsistent with the
Government intervention section, and it
is not likely to be included.
SEVERAL STATE CAUCUSES.
Bland and Pennoyer the Ticket
That Would Suit the
Oregonlans.
CHICAGO. 111., July <i.â .^veral State
delegations held caucuses at the Palmer
House to-night to select coramitteemen
and decide upon a choice for the Presi
dency. In the latter respect but poor re
sults were reached, most of the delegations
deferring action upon the question until
to-morrow.
There was an uninteresting fight in the
Michigan caucus. The gold men who were
seated by the National Committee were on
hand in force. The silver men tried to run
the caucus and insisted on adjourning
until after the credentials committee had
met. The gold men objected to this and
declared that unless business was pro
ceeded with they would bolt. The matter
was finally compromised by an adjourn
ment for two hours.
When the caucus reassembled the gold
men put through their candidates. The
silver men at once filed a protest on the
ground that the gold men were not prop
erly accredited delegates. The silver men
announced that they would fipht the mat
ter in the committee on credentials.
At the caucus of the Oregon delegation
it was decided to withdraw their candi
date, Bylvester Pennoyer, as a candidate
for the Presidency and run him for second
place. They will thro.^ whatever strength
they have to Bland, in return for which
tlie Bland men have, it is asserted, prom
ised to support Pennoyer for ?he Vice-
Presidency.
The Alabama contingent held a caucus
and heard speeches in behalf of Bland,
Boies, Matthews and others. They came
to no decision, however, and adjourned
until to-morrow.
The Texas delegation discussed the ad
visability of participating in the silver cau
cus, the secession of the Texas gold dele
gations and other matters and declared for
Mr. Bland.
The Mississippi delegation was addressed
by Governor Stone in behalf of Bland, and
also by the supporters of Boies. After
having heard arguments they adjourned
without expressing any choice.
ASSOCIATION CLUBS.
Conference of Representatives of
the State Organizations Pre
sided Over by McMlllln.
CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â A conference
of the representatives of State Associa
tions composing the National Association
of Democratic Clubs was held to-night at
the headquarters of the National Asso
ciation in the Auditorium. In the ab
sence of Postmaster-General Wilson, chair
man of the executive committee, who was
detained in "Washington by official duties,
Congressman Benton McMillinof Tennes
see., presided.
The States of New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont,
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine,
West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee,
Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Illinois, Indi
ana, Ohio, Minnesota, Utah, Wisconsin,
lowa, Colorado and California were repre
sented.
The condition of the club organizations
in those States was reported to be uni
formly good.
The reports of the probable attendance
of ..clubs throughout the country at the
National Convention to be held in St.
Louis on September 30 was of a character
to insure the most largely attended gath
ering of Democratic clubs in a National
campaign in the history of State and Na
tional league club organization.

CHICAGO, 111., July 6.â When Mr. Bai- I

informed by a reporter of the Unite \ Press
thai Illinois had voted 41 to 7 for Bland, he
exclaimed :
"That settles it; he is as good as nomi- j

He mentioned the fact that the Texas
delegation at Its meeting to-day had for- '
mally voted in accordance with the practi
cal instructions of the State Convention to â¢
give ils unanimous support to Blanl.
"He is the best man the convention can â

BELLAIRE, Ohio, July 6.â A cloud
burst occurred early this morning in this
section of Ohio, doing very great damage
to property. Sheep, horses and cattle

INCIDENT OF THE FOURTH
Americans and Canadians Drink
Together on a Rat Portage
Steamer.
United States Revenue Officer Seized
the Craft Inr Smuggling, but
It Got Away.
RAT PORTAGE, Ont., July 6.â A very
startling incident occurred at the Fourth
j of July celebration held at Long Point,
Minn., on the American side of the Lake
!of the Woods. A large excursion steamer
i left here Friday night with a large crowd
! intent on seeing the sports and joining in
i the festivities. The refreshment buffet of
! the steamer was not closed, as it should
I have been, and the Americans and Cana-
I dians showed their good fellowship by
; drinking Canadian whisky together.
A revenue othcer from the town of War
road, seeing a man intoxicated ashore, bo
| gan investigating. Finding the bar of tho
boat open he, with the aid of twelve
; American fishermen, immediately seized
i the craft as a smuggler, and put every
British sailor and passenger under arrest.
Yesterday the officer who remained in
! charge of the vessel directed Captain M < .
i Ritchie to sail for the mouth of the Rainy
River. The captain started for that port,
â  but changed his course unknown to the
othcer, and when in British water once
more he politely invited the Americans to
board a small steam launch which he hal
towed behind. As the British had the
superior force the Americans had no al
ternative and were taken to Rainy River,
while the steamer proceeded to Rat Port
atte. The matter will now have to be set
' tied between tho departments at Washing
ton and Ottawa.
A DESPERATE LOVER.
Prevented From Committing Murder and
Suicide by Det*ctivn.
WICHITA, Ka.ns.. July 6.â Miss Fanny
Minnick of Paola, Kans., came to this city
last week to escape the unwelcome atten
tions of August Mietzer, a young German
who had been employed on her father's
farm. Mietzer fell in love with Miss Min
nick and so annoyed her that \<e was dis
charged. He stili obtruded his attentions
on her, and when she came to Wichita he
decided to follow. He bought a revolver
and an engagement ring, and confided to
a friend that he was going to win iier or
kill her and then kill himself. Miss Min
nick was warned of the dancer, and to-day
when he entered the Wichita postoffice,
where he had arranged to meet her, de
tectives arrested him. He was fined $100
for carrying a concealed weapon. The
Minnick:- are prominent and wealthy.
LINCHED BY A MOB.
Fate of the Colored Assailant of the
Biix'.on Fatnily.
ROCKY ILLE, Md., July 6.â Sidney Ran
dolph, colored, who was confined in Mont
gomery County Jail here for a brutal
assault upon the Buxton family of
Gaithersburg, made J une 25, as a result of
wt.ich Sadie Buxton, the nine-year-old
daughtar, died, was taken from jail early
Saturday morning by a mob of twenty or
thirty people and hanged. Randolph pro
tested his innocence. The mob was well
organized and the entire nffair was con
ducted quietly and quicKiy. The motive
for Randolph's assault upon the Buxton
family has never been learned, but it is
generally believed it was done in revenge
for Buxton's testimony in a case against
a friend of Randolph's.

Cruel Trick of One of the Twin Shaft
Reacuer*.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., July 6.â The ex
citement attending the Twin Shaft catas
trophe was by no means abated by the
report last nitrht that rapoings from the
imprisoned men had been heard. An
other thoroueh investigation was made
last nicht, and it was finally learned that
John Owen did the tapping to encourage
the miners at work. Owen belonged to
one of the shifts and was promptly dis
charged.
At 1 o'clock this mornine the rescuers
encountered a large rock and very little
progress was made. All hope of finding
any one alive has been abandoned.

ALLIANCE, Nebr., July 6.â H.
Hubbell, a wealthy stockman of this place,
attended a dance at Lakeside last night
and was found near the railroad track
early this morning breathing his last. A
deep wound, presumably made by a blow
from a revolver on ti.e back of the head,
caused death. It is supposed that revenue
was the motive. He was brought to this
city this morning. There is little clew to
the murderer.

Being Unable to Secure Return
of Their Money a Riot
Results.
MANY HEADS ARE CRACKED.
Grand Stand Razed. Track and Fences
Demolished and General Havoc
Wrought.
MINNEAPOLIS. Mm., July 6.â For a
couple ot" hours to-night this city was
given over to mob rule and as a result
many people were injured, including sev
eral policemen. Tne trouble arose during
a female bicycle race. The management,
without previous announcement, raised
the price of admission from 25 cents to
$1 25, and when the time for starting
arrived the star attraction, Dottie Farns
worth, the champion woman rider of the
world, was not visible, but was detained
at her home as a result of illness.
The crowd refused to allow the race to
proceed and demanded their zuoney back.
The treasurer had, however, departed
with the receipts, and when this fact was
ascertained the riders were pulled bodily
from their wheels, the track was covered
with tacks and broken glass, and the
office was broken into by a couple of thou
sand enraged and defrauded people.
When they discovered that there was no
money in sight they took their revenge
out by tearing up the track, razing the
grand stand, ripping fences down, smash
ing several buildings into kindling-wood
and doing all the damage possible.
A mob alarm was turned into police
headquarters and a platoon of fifty police
men was sent to the spot. During the
clearing of the grounds several people
were badly injured, including three po
licemen, who were struck on the head
with bricks. Finally order was restored
and the injured men were removed to
their homes.
Action will be taken to-morrow against
the management, which includes several
prominent people, charging them with ob
taining money under false pretenses.
CHANING THE THREE FRIENDS.
Cnited States Crui*er Fails to Overtake,
the l ,'ihuMt.r
KEY WEST, Fla., July 6.â The steamer
Three Friends passed iiere at 9 a. m. pur
sued by the United States cruiser Raleigh.
Both vessels were under full steam, the
Three Friends being between eight and
ten miles ahead of the cruiser. When it
became known tnat a s-ieamer was being
chased up the gulf thousands of sympa
thizers rushed down to the beach and to
housetops to net a view of the brave little
filibuster. When first sighted the vessels
were a little this side of Sand Key light,
and, judging hy the volume of smoke cora
iiiLT from their smokestacks, were being
driven to their utmo>t capacity. W en
off this port the United States warship
Maine was signaled and the race kept on.
Finally when the Three Friends came in
uide the gulf the Raleigh altered her
course, giving up the chase. The reports
that the Raleigh fired at the steamer are
without foundation.

BRUSSELS, Belgium, July 6.â The re
turns from districts in which candidates
were elected and a forecast of re-ballots

ure to elect in a number of districts, show
that there will be no alteration in the po
sition of the parties in the Chamber of
Deputies.

Frankie Marr F.nd* Her Life With Car
bolic Arid
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 6.â Frankie Marr,
an eighteen-year-old girl, committed sui
cide this afternoon at the residence of F.
| H. Burke on the Alviso road, about three
i miles north of this city. The girl was an
; orphan, and bad been in the family over
| two years. She did some work around the
I house, but was tieeted much like an
adopted dauchter. Yesterday afternoon
Mrs. Burke drove to San Jose, and while
she was gone the girl was misled. The
door of her bedroom was found to be
lecked. Some stable boys were called
upon and when there was no response to
a call the uoor of the bedroom was broken
in. The pirl was found on the bed. life
already extinct. A bottle of carbolic acid
was close at hand and the burned appear
ance of the pirl's mouth showed that she
had taken a lar^e swallow of it. No cnuse
is known for the act, unless it was that
the girl was despondent over a slight re
proof by Mrs. Burke for some carelessness
in her work. Coroner Secord will hold an
inquest upon the remains to-morrow.
DISEASED CATTLE KILLED.
Inspector Spencer Stamping Out Tuber-
culosim on the Ranges.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 6.â The reportof
City and County Veterinary Spencer for
the month of June shows thathe inspected
3#l head of cattle and subjected them to
the tuberculine test. Of these 52 showed
the necessary reaction and were con
demned; m autopsies confirmed the reli
ability of the tests.
The report shows that about IV4 per
cent of the cattle are affected with tuber
culosis. He recommended that a place
be set apnrt for slaughtering such con
demned animals, and condemned the prac
tice of allowing owners to bury the dead
stock in their fields, as the germs of dis
ease would become distributed.

SAN RAFAEL SENSATION.
Auditor Benson Arrested on a
Charge of Assault and
Battery.
Comp'ainant Is His Mother-in-Law,
Against Whom H Lodges
Counter Charges.
SAN RAFAEL. Cal., July 6.â Gossipers
are bi.sy over a new outbreak of domestic
trouble in a family that has figured some
what conspicuously for the past eighteen
months in the divorce court, and whose
discords have furnished tootns.>me mor-
tor scandal-lovers. Two Justices of
the Peace have enlarged their dockets this
week, Justice Gardner with a complaint
from Auditor Benson charging Mrs. Gass,
his former wife's mot er and the grand
mother of his little son, with using foul
language. The hearing was cut short by
the lady pleadirtg gui'ty and the imposi
tion of a light fine, which was promptly
paid.
Tnis was only the aftermath of a rase
before Justice Rodden, brought by Mrs.
Gass, who charged Benson with assault
and battery. The wife about a year ago
obtained a divorce, securing $100 alimony
and the custody of her son, 4 years old,
the husband to have certain priviiiges of
visiting the boy.
Recorder Benson has always charged his
troubles to the mother-in-law, and the
latest strife was with her. The wife and
mother have made much of the fact that
the Recorder's assistant in his office was a
young lady, whom they regard with evi
dent disfavor. On Friday evening last
Benson, in company with Miss Jones, the
assistant, was pa^sinc the house where
his former family lived.
Mrs. G ass stood by the gate. He says
she vilified the young lady. Greatly an
pered lie save the mother-in-law a Â»!ap in
the lace, whereupon the trouble occurred
which is to be ventilated in court.
The woman resented the blow by s;oing
for him wild a Sharkey hug, which he re
sisted by pushing and such tactics as
wou'd offset a woman's onslaught. The
parties differ materially as to the injuries
inflicted. Mrs. Gaps tdinks she was
knocked down and fears that two of her
ribs are broken, besides other injuries.
Benson says he only pushed her away to
prevent her from clawing his face.
SANTA ROSA AFFRAY.
Court Reporter Hall's Chinese Cook. As-
saulted in the Residence of His
Employer.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., July 6.â Court Re
porter George Hall of this city was awak
ened about 2 o'clock Sunday morning by
what sounded to him like a highbinder
war. Mr. Hall hurriedly sought the room
of his Chinese cook, where he found, en
gaged in a bloody battle, the cook and a
strange Chinaman. The stranger had a
large but dull hatchet, which he had used
with great ( ffect upon the domestic. After
a struggle Hail succeeded in securing the
woul<i-be murderer with a rope and de
livering him to a police officer.
The object of the attack was robbery,
and the robber had entered the room dur
ing the cook's absence and tliere awaited
his unsuspecting countryman's return.
The first blow of the hatchet cut deep into
the cook's neck and the second laid his
scalp open for several inches. Only the
dullness of the hatchet prevented a mur
der.
It is believed that the two had been
gambling, and that the cook made a large
winning, while the other lost enough to
make him desperate. Beinsr familiar with
his more lucky companion's quarters, he
laid his plans to recoup by murder and
robbery.

EQUINE CONTESTS
ON NAPA'S TRACK,
Auspicious Opening of the
Agricultural Society's
Meeting.
JEFFE'S EASY VICTORY.
Captures the 2:40 Trot in Straight
Heats Without Being
Extended.
PRINCE BISMARCK IN FRONT.
Promise Me, a Good Thing in the
Pace, Beaten by the German-
Named Horse.
NAPA, Cal., July 6.-^ After a nocturnal
sleep of one year the Napa County Agri
cultural Society again threw open the
gates of its pretty park to circuit travelers
and the inhabitants of the valley to what
promises to be its greatest race m eet.
Over 250 horses are at the track, with
stable accommodations ior but 200.
Visitors are arriving on every incoming
train and boat, and the hotel proprietors
and boardiug-house keepers are in high
glee at the prospect of the rich harvest.
On this, the opening day, the gate was
f r. eto the public with a small admission
fee charge for seats in the grandstand.
When the old gentleman familiarly
spoken of as Sol, who ha> the contract for
suriplvine this earth with heat, poured
his scorching rays down on the lovely
valley this morning he evidently intended
overcoats and ulsters to be a superfluity,
for the day bid fair to be a scorcher.
But as racing time at the track drew
nigh a cooling breeze that fanned the f aces
of the pretty women and their escorts in
the grand stand made perfect %veather for
light harness sport. Handsome turnouts,
crowded with the elite of Napa, lined up
in the in-field, and the rural visitor with
his buckboard was quite as well repre
sented.
In the judges' stand were F. W. Loeber,
E. H. Winship and C. L. La Rue, and
their rulings, which were just and impar
tial, i-ave satisfaction to all. Starting
Judge McNair was on hand with his flag,
and his work, which was a revelation to
local race-goers, is the talk of Napa. D. '
McVicker and Pete Brandow did the
clerking.
While the snort was excellent, it had a
tendency to drag anl become tiresome,
and less bickering and more punctuality
would tend to hold the crowd until the >
tinal heat was decided. Two events â the j
2:40 trot and the 2:25 paceâ formed the
card. Not .me of a sensational character,
marked either race.
The trot was called first, but proved a
very slow betting affair, from the fact that
ihe talent considered it a "mral" for
Jeffe. Pool-seller Leach found it difficult
to get $6' for the Held, $,'1 lor t lay S and $3
fcr Hunyadi against thrÂ» $10 bid for the
favorite. He won in straight heats with
out effort in 2:20%, 2:2o and 2.-18U,'.
He trotted the second quarter in the
second heat at a 2:10 clip, and is confi
dently expected to lower the colors of 'he
Fresno horse. Homeward, when they meet
on Friday. Alias gained second money
and Faro Bank third.
The 2:25 pace was a much better specu
lating nffair. The closing pools before the
first h'-at was trotted soid: Field $10,
Promise Me $5 and F'rince Bismarck $5.
Promise Me was the hot Up for the heat,
and the wise ones backed him off the
board of the solitary layer of odds. In a
close finish Lafferty mnnaged to land the
heat with the good thing by a neck from
Sam H in 2:l6VÂ£.
The latter, on his good showing the last
100 yards, was now in great demand,
bringing $10 against $6 for the field, with
few buyers of the latter end.
The favorite and Prince Bismarck, the
German-named horse hauling a green
sulky, passed Resort as he went to a break
on the bend for the wire and fought the
beat out, Sam winning quite easily in
2:18.
It looked all over now and Sam H sold
for $20, with the balance going for $3 or $4.
It was not Sam's day to shine, thou
for the German horse hauling the green
sulky, driven by a driver wearing an
emerald-colored coat and carrying a chain
instead of a whip, took the heat by two
lengths in 2:2lJÂ£, after leading from the
word go.
The Prince now had the call, and he
took the fourth heat in 2:l9>Â£. with Sam
H again second. The concluding heat of
the race, the filth, was the most exciting
of the afternoon. In a great drive from
the head of the home stretch, McDonald
got Prince Bismarck home a head before
Sam in 2:20.

ELLINOTO'S FORECAST.
Thinks the l.eandtrn Should WinTo-Day's
Boatrace.
LONDON, Eno., Juiy 6â Mr. Ellington,
the rowing expert of the Field, telegraphs
from Henley to the United Press as fol
lows:
No hard work was done by any crew to
day. All did starts and short bursts.
Yale made one or two starts in the morn
ing, when they did not get off as well as
usual. They were slow in getting away,
were irregular and did great splashing.
In the evening they had a better start,
but they sÂ»em sure to be led at the first by
the Lewndors, who are very smart at start
ing. The Yule men, however, quickly set
tle down to their work. The New College
crew are also good starters.
They took a spin this afternoon with
the Radley College crew, who are entered
for the ladies' challenge plate, and went
away from them in an easy style that was
much admired.
The Leanders had a race with ihe Eton
College crew, who are also entered for the
ladies' challenge plate. The latter did
be:terthan was expected, but the Lean
ders easily held them.
The Thames crew are likely to be
formidable and also the Trinity Hall crew.
The winner of the heat between the first
Trinity and London Rowing clubs will be
dangerous in the finals if the wind should
lavor them.
Dr. McDowell, though he has not yet
rowed the half course, has shown great
speed, and it is not unlikely that he will
win some of the heats for the diamond
sculls. Ho will Live his best competitors
a good race. Rupert Guinness and Vivian
Nickalls are in prime condition. The lat
ter sculls better than ever.
All the crews are healthy. A most bril
liant and successful meeting is anticipated.
All things being equal, the Leander crew
has the consensus of preference over Yale,
alti:ough the former may be defeated by
the New College crew.

ham. The battalion came up by boat yes
terday morning and marched straight to
the grove.
Although the battalion is here on an
outing strict military discipline is en
forced, and should one of the guardsmen
linger too long in saying "Au Ilevoir, but
not Good-by," and arrive at camp after 11
o'clock at nit'ht he will be assigned quar
ters in the guardhouse. The guardhouse
is locateo. just at the entrance to the camp
and is rather inappropriately designed, in
slangy locution, "the cooler." There is
no ice there, and nothing cooler than the
atmosphere, so the Stockton fair ones
should not detain the military men after
11 o'clock.
The boys at camp are a merry lot, and
there will be uala times before the weefc is
out. Yesterday afternoon and evening
many visitors called Â«nd were made wel
come. Next to valiance, tallantry is the
most prominent, trait of the sol ier lads,
and their grac on the ballroom floor is
second only to their skill in the manual of
arms.
Last night the tents, all gayly lighted
with incandescent lumps, presented a
sight as pretty as eye could wish to see.
After the visitors had left the grove all
was hushed. The sentry paced up and
down in front of the entrance to the camp,
ready to charge upon any intruder, either
human or of the mosquito family. Many
of the guardsmen, who were weary after
the parade in the metropolis on the Fourth
and tired after their trip hither on the
boat, were fast in slumber and seemed to
be the envy of the sentry. From the club
house at the grove came the strains of a
guitar and a mandolin, but nothing save
the heroic voice of the stirring bugle would
disturb the sleepers.
In the 240 men in camp there is consid
erable talent which furnishes amusement
for the others and makes the evenings pass
quickly and pleasantly. The Hawaiian

In the matter of making fun Jarues Gil

man in a minstrel shpw, ; and his comic

Irish comedian of ihe battalion, and Ed

Visitors are welcome at the camp after
10 o'clock in the forenoon, but not before
thai hour. By that time the .rubrnirii;
routine is over and the tents are made up

free to go where they choose, and they
are at liberty again after supper until 11

The sergeants of Company C gave a
smoker in their tent last evening, the
principal features of toe affair being good
cigars and good stories, or rather â well,
the boys say they were good stories. The

Two Women of Montecito
the Victims of an
Assassin.
SHOT AND STABBED IN
THEIR HOME.
Mrs. Richardson Is Mortally
Wounded and Her Daughter
Put to Death.
VENGEANCE THE MOTIVE FOR
THE CRIME.
A Man to Whom Suspicion Pointed
Commits Suicide to Escape
Arrest.
SANTA BARBARA, Cat,., July 6.â The
hand of an unknown assassin has wiped
out the surviving members of one of the
best-known and most respected of all the
wealthy and cultured families who have
made their homes in beautiful Muntecito.
The dwelling of Mrs. H. R. Richardson
was invaded last night by this fiend, the
equal of Butcher Dunham in savage feroc
ity, and t;.e aged woman was wounded
with knife and bullet until her death is
but the question of a few hours, Her
pretty daughter Ethel was murdered, t^e
butcner pursuing her from the house, after
he had twice shot her, and finishing the
bloody work by clubbing the girl into In
sensibility and then cutting her throat.
M r . Richardson's son, who had threat
ened the lives of his stepmother and step
sister, has been under suspicion ; but the
suicide to-night of Cyrus Barnard, an
other suspect, may clear the mystery and
prove the innocence of the relative.
Four miles from town, a little beyond
the cemetery, near '.he frequently traveled
road to the beautiful suburb of Montecito
and on a slight eminence fronting the sea,
stands a ian:e gray villa surrounded by
broad lawns and flowering shrubs. This
ho;:se was erected six years ago by Henry
R. Richardson, a Canadian gentleman of
wealth and a former resident of Coaticook,
m the province of Quebec. The Richard
sona were people of intelligence, but of
simple, home-lovinz taEtes. Their only
daughter, Ethel, 18 years old, attended
the sjanta Barbara Higli School, graduat
ing two years ago, since which iime she
lias been taking post-graduate studies at
the same school, with the intention of re
moving to Berkeley to pursue a higher
course this fall.
Ethel was a pretty girl of medium
height, witn a girlisti figure, a beautiful
complexion, blue eyes and a quaint,
bri^i.t face. In character and disposition
she uas exceedingly winsome, and she
was a general favorite among all who
knew her.
The mother was a woman of middle age
and sweet and kindly disposition. The
faitier was generally recognized as an up
right and faithful friend, but somewhat
stern.
A wayward son, Mr. Richardson's child
by his first wife, was their one sorrow and
shame. On March 30 of this spring Mr.
Kichardson died, with almost his last
breath condemning his son. Since his
death tne wife and daughter have lived on
wichout servants in the great house, oc
casionally having a friend there for com
pany. Yesterday afternoon they drove
out to visit a sick friend and afterward to
the cemetery to give kindly directions to
the sexton to permit the burial of a friend's
child in their lot. They returned home at
du>k, ai;d from this hour the history of
the night is a mystery, the subject of
drcauful speculation.
A laborer, Frank Cordero, passing down
the road on foot at <J:.'JO o'clock this morn
ing, saw in a field beside the Richardson
grounds, at a point where they angle
y with tne road, what he conceived
to be the body of a man lying on the
ground. He walked on to the camp and
reported the circumstances to a fellow
wurkman, proposing that they return and
examine it, as it might be some one they
knew.
The men returned and, entering the
field, beheld a horribie and piteous sight.
Prone on the stnbble-field, lying on her
face, cold in death, horribly bruised and
disfigured and covered with blood, was
the body of poor Ethel Richardson. There
were bullet holes in her neck and cuts on
her head, and the fair young figure was
nude, save for a blood-stained little knit
shirt that but partially covered it. Her
arni3 were folded under ncr and in her
hands was a nightrobe drenched with
bloood. Pools of blood stood on the black
soil about her.
Kindly hands placed a sheet over the
mutilated form and the Coioner and
Sheriff were summoned by telephone from
town. Meantime Cordero and his Cali
fornian friend proceeded to the house,
knowing that the two Jadies dweit there
alone and unprotected, and suspecting
that tne tragedy which had found so
phastly a termination in the field might
have had its beginning there.
The stillness of death reigned in and
about the premises, confirming their
worse forebodings, but they found all of
the doors securely locked. These Cali
fornians are men bred to note and value j
every trivial indication, and before the
crowd of curious and sympathetic had in
vaded the premises they made a thorough
and searching examination of the grounds.
They found the track of a small man's
foot leading into the grounds from a point
i;c-ar the public road and close beside a
little cowshed at the end of the stable.
These footprints they traced to the house
and they aiterward tound the print of the
girl's bare feet leading from the front ve
randa around the house, drops of blood
marking her course and the tracks of the
ruan following, the paces of both far apart,
showing the wild race the girl had made
for her life around the house. They fol
lowed them and along the road leading to
the entrance to the grounds, where a stout
chain hung between two stone posts.
Here Ethel evidently climbed over the
' ham, intending to reach the nearest neigh
ihe Wallens, living an eighth of a
mile distant.
The man leaped a barbed-wire fence
and intercepted her. finishing his bloody
work hy first beating her with the loaded
stick he carried until it broke and then
drawing his knife and cutting her throat.
When the Coroner arrived, he broke
open the door of the House and found all
of the lower rooms in perfect order. The
ground floor of the house consists of a
square front hallway, a parlor at the right
beside it, a library behind the hall, a
dining-room beside it and in the rear
i kitchen, butler's pantries and closets. Up
stairs, across the front of the hall, is a lit- ;
tie room extended across the roof of the j
front veranda, which in all probability
afforded the murderer a means of ingress
and of concealment.
Beside it is the mother's room, a large !
front chamber, simply but handsomely i
furnished. A long, narrow entry separates
it from the daughter's room, which is at
the head of the stairs and from another
room in the rear of the front chamber,
while there are emaller chambers, bath
room, etc., at the rear.
They met a horrible and ghastly sight as
they reached the upper story. Across the
threshold of her chamber lay Mrs. Kich
ardson, unconscious, her head on a pillow
drenched and clotted with blood. Her
I night dress was stained with crimson and
her pretty gray hair and comely face
bathed in blood.
Great pools of her life's fluid were
around her; the bed was stained with it,
and on the further side of the bed, near its
head, was a blackening pool, showing
where she had evidently leaped from the
bed to escape the assassin and received a
second or third bullet.
A hasty examination showed tnat her
wounds were fatal, and the only hope has
been that she might recover consciousness
to speak her murderer's name. This, the
paysicians declare, there is no hope for.
All day long she has been lying uncon
scious, slowly drifting toward the eternal
shore, where husband and daughter are
waiting.
No attempt has been made to make a
\ thorough examination of her injuries, the
, only effort being to render her few remain
ling moments of life comfortable; but Dr.
Winchester states that she has a bruise I
! across her forehead, cut down to the skull, j
a parallel bruise two or three inches fur
ther back on the head and a bullet wound
one inch below the left eye. This ranged
upward and backward. Another passed
through one hand and there are numerous i
1 other wounds and injuries. She is dying I
i of internal hemorrhage.
The bruises and cuts upon her body were
! evidently inflicted with the stick "which
\va- found beside little Ethel's body.
This stick is about the length of an
ordinary cane. It is about an inch and a
half in diameter at the head, tapering to j
I the end, which has no ferrule. A cylin
; drical cavity has been made in the upper
end, and the pieces of lead with which
this was loaded were picked up on the j
i floor of Mrs. Richardson's room. The I
: cruel blows had splintered it, and it was
I broken in twain as well, and stained '
; through and through with blood. It is i
i said that the wood of which it is made '
grows only on the Santa Barbara Channel !
: islands.
Before the forenoon was half gone the
Richardson home was invested by sight-
I seers and friends. At an early hour it be
came necessary to close the house to all
but those admitted by the Coroner's or
: ders.
Meantime the officers of the law were
: not idle. All roads leading out of town
were watched and every suspicious charac- i
: ter in town was under surveillance. Men !
, went out to search the mountain trails for
a track similar to the murderer's, and
before noon the report was received that i
on the old Romero trail, crossing the .^anta .
Ynez range above Montecito, a footprint i
! had been found which corresponded to the j
tracks about the grounds.
A posse of officers and citizens at once
started on this trail and at a late hour j
had not yet returned. Fo convinced were
the officers that the fiendish crime must
have been the work of personal enmity '
: and therefore of the poor women's only j
j declared foe, the absent stepson, who had \
\ spent some time in Santa Barbara, leav- â 
j ing here for the East two years ago, that
I descriptions of this man were sent broad-
I cast over the country.
The fact of his bitterness toward his
I relatives, combined with his father's re
| cent death and his disposition of his prop
erty to his wife and daughters, there being I
1 one daughter by the first marriage (a Mrs. j
Norton, living in Boston), the deeds and
will having been only recently tiled, j
seemed to afford a strong chain of reason '
: upon which to base this hypothesis. At
; one time a report was received from Ven
tura that Scott Richardson had been ap- !
prehended there, but this proved to be
baseless.
At an eariy hour a Coroner's jury was I
impaneled, consisting of the following i
j citizens: J. R. Vance, P. D. Mever, Ben !
i Hayne, W. H. Maris, Jerome C". Wilson, !
i Edward Harper, W. H. Myers, John B. i
; Savitz, C. A. Mabbott, E Packard, T. F. !
! Leslie, H. Appor, J. M. Emery, Alter
viewing the body and the premises at 2
i o'clock they began the taking of testi
! mony.
Frank Cordero was the first witness |
I called. He testified to the finding of i
! Ethel Richardson's body in the field ad- '
! joining the residence grounds at 6:30 ;
j o'clock in the morning. It was clad in a'â 
! single undergarment. The body was lying i
j face downward.
J. Ayala corroborated the testimony of
Cordero, with theadditiona! circumstances !
I that beneath the girl, under her arms, was
a nightdress soaked with blood. A pe
culiar feature of his testimony was his as
sertion that in passing the place on horse
back at 6:15 o'clock he had not observed
| the body, which was quite plainly in sight |
! from tne road.
Mr. Eckels testified that at an early
â  hour this morning he was called upon by
Frank Cordero and informed that a girl's j
] body was found in the field near the i
| Richardson place. He went with Cordero j
! to the place and identified the body as |
! that of Ethel Richardson. He corroborat
i ed the preceding testimony and added
I that he went to Mrs. Wallin' s and pro
i cured a sheet and covered the body, not
I disturbing its position. He then went to
| the cemetery and telephoned to the Coro
ner ana the Sheriff.
Antonio M. Ruiz, the Coroner, was the
first person to enter the house after the
discovery of the girl's body. He described I
the position and condition of Mrs. Rich- I
ardson. Mr 3. Thomas Taber, an old fani- j
I lly friend, testified as to the manner in j
I which the rooms were occupied by the i
family. She explained that Mrs. Richard
son occupied the room at the right of the .
i hall, in the front of the house, and that ,
her daughter slept in the room across the !
hail from this, at the head of the staircase. !
There was no communicating door be- I
tween the rooms, which were separated by .
the hallway.
She examined these sleeping-rooms this
morning and found Miss Ethel's room in
I order, bearing no evidence whatever of a
straggle. The girl's clothing was lying
on a chair at the head of ttie bed. the bed
clothing partly thrown back as if she had
Started to lie down. Her impression was i
that Ethel was about to retire when she
beard her mother's screams and ran to j
her. There was nothing to indicate that I
she had been attacked until she came out I
of her room, yet the trail of blood down j
thn stairs and out of the front door was
i evidence that she bad been attacked witnin
] the house and ran out of doors, wounded
and bleeding, to escape her murderer.
Mrs. Taber positively stated that there
had been no opening of bureau drawers or
disturbance of any kind to indicate that
robb ry had been the motive for the mur
der. Even Ethel's jewel case, which stood
in her room, was undisturbed and the con
tents intact.
Mrs. Taber testified that a son of Mr.
Richardson and a stepson of Mis. Richard
son, one Scott Richardson, was living.
Kttiel had never seen her half-broiher and
did not know him. Her father and mother
were unwilling to have her know him, as
they were afraid he might do ncr some
harm. She stated that during his lust ill
ness Mr. Richardson told her that that bad
boy of his was killing him. His grief over
the boy's behavior made him unwilling to

get well. He said he had never heard
Scott make threats of personal violence,
but he had heard from others here that
Scott had said he would kill that wife
of his father. But Mrs. Richardson was
very kind to him and his family, and |
while he lived in Santa Barbara "carried
him and his family provisions to make
them comfortable.
Mrs. Tabor's testimony was very clear,
thoughtful and intelligent, and in spite
of her seventy-odd years she proved the
best and most helpful witness summoned.
Mrs. Fanny V. Wallin, a neighbor living
100 yards distant, stated that after she re
tired last night, about 9 o'clock, she heard
a noise that she attributed to some trouble
among their stock. A few minutes later
she heard a groan, and although it did not
pound in the direction of their barn she
believed it came from an old horse of I
theirs. A few seconds later she beard an
other prolonged groan, and told her hus
band that she was sure this time that some
human being was in distress. He there
upon arose and went out to the barn and
found that everything was all right. Be
ing superstitious, she concluded tnat the
sound was a premonition. Twice after
they heard a noise and groans, and her
husband went out twice again and searched |
for the cause. They heard no screams and
no pistol-shots. Mrs. Wallin stated that
she usually saw a light in the Richardson
residence after 10 o'clock, but thought the
family had retired earlier since the old
gentleman's death.
W. L. Rust testified to knowing a man,
Hiram Barnard, who used to work for Mrs.
Richardson, with whom he often talked.
He described him as a short, slight man
with drooping mustache. On Friday af
ternoon he saw him on State street, clad
in a blue suit. He said he had tramped
up to the northern part of the State and
had had a hard experience. When asked
if he had any reason to connect the
man with the murder Rust stated that
Barnard on Friday offered to sell him a
new $17 rifle for $10, declaring that he
would have to have the money before 6
o'clock, and that he would leave town on
Sunday or Monday at the latest. Hearing
of the mysterious small footprint found
upon the Richardson place and remember
ing the man's small foot he volunteered
this information thinking the man in ques
tion might be worth looking up.
Dr. Richards J. Hall testified to having
made an external examination of Kttiel
Richardson's body, which was sufficient
to determine the cause of death. She died,
probably, of hemorrhage, from a stab
wound in the throat. There were two bul
let wounds in the neck, either of which
would have caused death, and numerous j
other injuries, cuts and fractures of bones, j
including a bullet in her left arm, none of !
which would have caused death. All of
the bullets aDpear to have emerged from
the body. The stab wound was probably
inflicted where she died.
The body was cold, but no rigidity had
set in, so that it was not likely that she
had been dead more than four or five
hours. His judgment was that she had
been dead not more than five hours nor '
less than four hours; yet she was so cold
that it was possible she had been dead ten
or twelve hours. The bullet wounds ap
peared to have Deen made with about a
32-cftliber ball.
.^he was probahiy stabbed while in a
standing position "or struggling on the
ground. This knife wound cut the trachae
and Kosophogus completely through, sev
ering many small vessels, but not the
jugular vein. It was possible, in his judg
ment, for her to have run to the spot
where she was found after receiving the
shots. She had a broken forearm, a broken
elDow, a cut on the ear, a cut on the scalp
and numerous bruises, eviaently inflicted
with the loaded cane found close beside
the body.
Eben J. Packard, a neighbor and dairy
man, testified as to his acquaintance with
the stepson, Scott Richardson. He saw
him two years ago, before he left here, os
tensibly lor Minneapolis. Mr. Packard as
serted that he had heard Scott Richardson
declare he would get even with the family, j
He would see them in hell. They had rob- j
bed him of his rights.
He was referring to the stepmother and
iialf-sister. He iieard Scott make tnese
threats at least six or eight times. He
might not have said the precise word
"kill," but his ttireats involved their de- !
Btruction. He was usually drunk when i
Mr. Packard saw him, and the witness
only reproved him.
Mr. Packard said that this bitter quarrel
was the only subject on which either |
father or son could converse. When he j
met either they talked about the other, i
They seemed almost insane on the sub- 1
ject. Scott's enmity seemed most particu
larly directed against the father and this]
girl, his half-sister. He said they had I
stolen $ 10,000 from him. He would have
the property if the step-mother and
daughter wore not in existence.
Mr. Packard had attached little im
portance to the man's talk, regarding it as \
only the excitable utterances of a drunken
man.
The verdict rendered by the jury was
that Ethel Richardson, a native of Canada
and a resident of California, came to her
death by a pistol shot at the hands of a
party or parties unknown to the jury.

THE DEATH OF BARNARD
Shoott Himnelf Aflrr Resisting Arrest
With Mullets.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., July 6.âAn
other tragedy was added late this evening
to the day's horrors, which will either
clear the Richardson murder mystery or
add to it another tangle. Word was
brought to the Coroner that Cyrus Ber
nard, the former gardener of the Richard
sons and who was, by Will Rush's testi
mony, connected with the crime, had shot
himself.
This report was found to be correct in
its essence, although somewhat faulty in
circumstances.
Ex City Marshal Hopkins, acting now
as a deputy Sheriff, had canvassed the list
of persons in and about Santa Barbara who
might have been connected with thiscrime.
Without any particular reason, as he states,
but acting rather Intuitively, he settled j
upon Cyrus Barnard, being continued in
his suspicion by the discovery that Bar- :
nard had recently pawned his gold watcn !
and a 3S-caliber revolver with a local bar- |
keeper and on July 1 had redeemed the !
weapon, stating that he should need it. It
was ascertained that Barnard's shoes cor- '
respond to the murderer's tracks.
After conferring with Sheriff Hicks,
they agreed that it wouid be wise to arrest
the man, and determined to keep the ar- I
rest secret, as they were sure they knew
his character well enough to rely upon
easily extracting a confession from him
should he be guilty of the crime. Hop
kins called upon Deputy Sheriff J. N.
Johnson to accompany him, and a little
before 10 o'clock proceeded to Barnard's
cottage.
As thoy reached the gate they saw Bar
nard cdming up the street. He called out,
"Hello, Hop? Wnat do you want?"
"Good evening, Barnard," Hopkins re
plied, 'I want you."
Barnard dodged within his cottage, leav
ing a screen door closed between him and j
the men. Hopkins incautiously struck a i
matcii, mteading to follow him and wish
ing to see his way.
"What do you want?'' asked Barnard
again.
"Come ont and I'll tell you," was the
response.
"Tell me now, Hop; look out!"
By this time the match had flamed up
brightly, revealing Hopkins' and John
son's forms to the man caged witnin the
liny cabin. A shot sounded anu a .'>B
caliber ball pierced the rim of Hopkins'
fell hat, ranging upward, but powder
burning the ex-Marshal's face, at such
close range were the men.
Hopkins instantly answered the fire
taking a center aim as well as he could in
the darkness The screen door sprung to
and a second shot was heara from Bar
nard's pistol. The two officers, not know
ing the effect of Hopkins" shot, (leaded
that as the man was evidently desperate
it would be wise to get more heln. They
went off, leaving the house in darkness.
When they returned with lights tbey
found Barnard lying dead on the floor
shot through the heart.
Only a superficial examination of the
dead man's pockets and oi the premises
could be made to-night and nothing was
found of a directly incriminating charac
ter. To-morrow papers and letters found
in the house will be examined and may
throw some light on the mystery. Bar
nard has been generally looked upon as a
weak and susceptible fellow, whose frailty
has been a disposition to conceive violent
passions for young ladies with whom he
had no acquaintance.
He has recently set up in the profession
of a dog-trainer and is said to have car
ried a stick similar to the one found on
the scene of the Richardson tragedy. His
mother, an excellent woman, a Mrs. Pet
ersen, lives in Santa Barbara. All eyes
are turned in expectation to the revela
tions the morrow must bring forth.
VETERANS CAPTURE HUENEME.
Over Five Hundred Are Entertained at the
Homestead of Hon. Thomas
R. Bard.
VENTURA, Cal., July 6.â The South
ern California Veterans' Association cap
tured Huenome to-day, and to-night but
one name is heard in Camp Phil Sherri
dan. Hon. Thomas R. Bard is the hero
of the hour.
The members of the association and
kindred societies to the number of 535 were
entertained at the Bard homestead at
Hueneme, the tables being located on the
lawn fronting his residence.
Prior to the luncheon speeches were
made by Commander Downing, Superior
Judge Buckley of Sonoma County, and
Mrs. S. C. Sweet, president of the Woman's
Auxiliary Association.
The address of welcome was made by
Rev. Morriil on behalf of the citizens of
Hueneme and Hon. Thomas Bard.
At the conclusion of the address Colonel
John Brookes handed the reverend gentle
man a handsome badge of the association
and presented him with an honorary mem
bership on tne association.
To-morrow will be observed as Ventura's
day under the auspices of Cushing Corps,
G. A. 11., for whom the day is named.
Friday the annual election will be neld.
Andrew J. Bell of Ventura is the only
name so far mentioned for the post com
mander.
Viiiess unexpected opposition develops
he will be chosen, making the second time
in the history of the organization that the
honor has come to Ventura County.
An item of interest to the G. A. P.. asso
ciations throughout the State is develop
ing in the proposed scheme to divide the
Department of California into two divi
sions, with the division line at Tehachapi.
The sentiment among the rank and file
strongly favors the proposed scheme. If
opposition develops it will come from San
Francisco and the past commanders, who
will exert their united influence to defeat
the movement. No definite action has
been taken, but the idea is rapidly gain
ing strength in the southern tier of
G. A. R. posts.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 6.â Rev. Burt
Estes Howard is a Presbyterian pastor no
longer. The circumstances of tbe division
and strife in the fashionable old First Pres
byterian Church of tnis city and Howard's
part therein has been considered and
passed upon by two Presbyteries, one

lating to Howard's affairs, and later the
assembly reversed the judgment ot the
synod. All in ail, Mr. Howard has been
the unwilling cause of much tribulation,
and some acrimonious contentions.
At a nneting of the local Presbytery
here to-day, the relations between Rev.
Mr. Hovtard and Westminster Church
were formally dissolved, his renunciation
of the Presbytery's authority recorded and
his name forever dropped from its rolls.
This action leavis Rev. Howard and the
Westminster Society in the position of a
di>tinct and independent religious body.
The ministers composing the Presby
tery were by no means a unit on several
of the points involved, and as a result
warm discussions followed t tie several
resolutions. It was moved by Dr. Hartley
of Riverside that a committee be ap
pointed to draft a pastoral letter, to be is
sued to the individual members of the
Westminster Church, urging ttiem to re
turn. Mr. Chichester suggested that this
was an excellent means of showing their
food will toward the Westmnster Church,
he proposition was adopted.

and, thinking the revolver was not loaded,
he snapped it at Wolf. The bullet entered
the breast just above the heart.

CAMPING IN THE
SONOMA VALLEY,
League of the Cross Cadets
on an Outing at Aqua
Caliente.
LIFE IN A TENTED CITY
Strict Military Discipline Is
Maintained by Those in
Command.
MASS SAID UNDER THE TREES
The Pretty Camp Named Montgomery,
in Honor of Los Angeles'
Bishop.
Camp Montgomery, )
League of the Cross Cadets, >
Aqua Caliente, Cal., July 6.)
When the sun went down behind the
rounded hills of Sonoma Valley to-night a
huge bonfire was built before two big trees
in the center of the clustered tents. The
cadets and scores of visitors from Sonoma,
including a number of ladies, gathered
around on improvised seats and made the
night ring with campfireand college songs.
The cadets have been encamped here
since last Saturday. By this time all the
tents are well stretched and arranged and
everything is snug. They wi'l remain in
camp until Sunday evening. Many dis
tinguished visitors are expected this week.
About 125 men are in camp, comprising
chiefly Companies A and lof the League
of '.he Cross Cadets.
The strictest military discipline is main
tained. It is far from being all play.
There is a guardhouse, which, us yet, has
been without a prisoner. At night there
is a countersign, and is worth almost a
man's life to get through the linos with
out it. A guard is kept up during the day.
The cadets have guard mount after dress
parade in the evening.
The officers are: Company Aâ r ;i ptain,
Frank S. Drady ; first lieutenant, William
C. Hooper; second lieutenant, K. G. Drady.
Company Iâ Captain, Peter J. Haggerty;
first lieutenant, Charles F. Skelly; second
lieutenant, Henry J. Power. Dr. A. P. Mul
ligan is camp physician, and doing chap
lain duty is Rev. James A. McDonald.
Military instruction is given by Maior T.
Drady and Captain H. P. Filgale. To-day
Lieutenant Skelly was officer of the day,
and Lieutenant R. Drady officer of the
guard.
Among the visitors expected at Camp
Montgomery during the week are Rev.
Father M. P. Ryan, chaplain of the regi
ment of the League of the Cross Cadets;
Rev. Father P. C. Yorke, and possibly
Bishop Montgomery of Los Angeles. The
camp is named afier BisboD Montgomery.
He is the founder of the League of the
Cross Cadets.
Other visitors coming during the week
are the Grand Council of the Young
Ladies' Institute of San Francisco. They
will arrive Saturday morning and remain
until camp breaks up on Sunday. The
young ladies will number about thirty. A
dancing platform has just been erected.
One of the most solemn and impressive
and at the same time pretty scene of the
camp so far was military mass, which
was said under the trees in front of head
quarters yesterday morning. The Catholic
Church at Sonoma was recently burned.
There was a little multitude from Sonoma
worshiping under the overspreading trees,
in addition to the cadets. The camp is
about three miles out from Sononm. but
trains stop directly in front of Camp
Montgomery. Company A belongs to St.

AFTER liLYiii&s MILLIONS.
Kentucky Members of the Family Will
Stnu With the Case.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 6.â The fight
for Millionaire Blythe's millions is still on.
B. M. Blythe of Downey left to-day for
San Francisco. He received letters from
his attorneys saying that they are ready to
appeal the case of the Kentucky Blythes
to the Supreme Court of the United
States.
"I am going to put up the money to
defray the expenses in that appeal," said
Mr. Blythe.
The attorneys for Florence Blythe at
that trial contended that she was adopted
under section 230 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. She was illegitimate and a
subject of Queen Victoria. England has
no adoption law. The Probate Court
decided she was adopted under section
23u. The case was appealed to the Supreme
Court in bane.
"We think we will defeat her in the
Supreme Court of the United States," said
Blythe. "Mrs. Florence Blythe-Hinckley
is an impostor. She is the daughter of
Joseph James Sopcroft, who married her
mother when Florence was 3 years old.
She is not the child of Thomas H, Blythe,
and for that reason and many others I am
going to stay with the tight 'till the Ken
tucky Blythes win."

SPORT AT SAXTA. CREZ.
Fishermen Credit the Salmon Hun to the
Iteparturr oj H'arxliips.
BANTA CRUZ, Cal., July 6.â The fish
ermen are crediting the big run of salmon
to the departure of the warships and the
cessation of booming cannon over the
waters of the bay during the target prac
tice engaged in by the Philadelphia and
Monadnock. They say that while the
ships are burning powder at Monterey all
the fish at that point will come to Santa
Cruz.
However that may be nearly 200 salmon
were taken to-day and fewer boats were
out than yesterday. It does not matter to
the fishermen nor the sportsmen what is
the cause of the sudden rush of salmon
into the old fishing-grounds. They are
here and since the supply of sardir.es is
increasing the prospects are favorable for
a heavy and long run.

SONORA, Cal., July 6.â The residence

This is another holiday.
Here's Doping that Yale will win the
boa trace.
Monterey is now prepared to raise every
thing in sight.
Don't leave the City for your holidays
before you register.
You will find your happiest friends at
Monterey this week.
Commodore Sloat raised the flag and it
is our duty to whoop it up.
Chicago awoke this morning without the
faintest idea where she is at.
All that is left to Senator Teller is a
chance to be ring-master in a sideshow.
Why do we allow the Chicago conven
tion to go ahead and then stop a prize
right?
The Baa) [a given over to partisanship,
bat California Is still busy with patriotic
cole orations.
Cleveland's favorite song is: 'Had I a
donkey that would not go 1 would not
lick him, oh no!"
It is becoming more evident every day
that Whitney is made of a kind of stuff
that shrinks in the wash.
Cleveland will treat the Chicago conven
tion like the Gorman tariff and let it pass
without his indorsement.
It is another evidence of the contradic
tory condition of things at Chicago that
the favorite dark horse is White.
Senator Bill has bad experience in lead
ing forlorn hopes, but that affords him
now neither profit nor consolation.
Taking the festival*, carnivals and pub
lic holidays together, we hardly have time
to do any work between recreations.
Whitney was a great man four years ago,
but now he is not high enough to overlook
even Mich a stub and twist as Altgeld.
The mouth of Pennoyer of Oregon will
be as good a bore as any for the Democ
racy to use in making its last blowout.
If you wish to count as a factor in the
campaign for prosperity you miut join a
Republican club and help in the work.
Democratic bosses might as well begin
advertising for men to attend the ratifica
tion meetings if they expect to have any.
The brevity of Cleveland's Fourth of
July letter is a pleasing proof that the
tired feeling is getting in its work in the
right place.
The real Issue before the country is
whether we are to have a government at
Washington or a continuance of the mis
povernmenL
A party that cannot conduct a Na
tional convention with decency certainly
cannot conduct the affairs of the Govern- j
ment with honor.
Planks enough have been taksn to Chi- !
cago to make a bridge, but there isn't
brains enough in the party to make a
bridge out of them.
The Chicago convention cannot agree
la approving anything, bat it could be
made harmonious in a minute on a plat- '
form denouncing Cleveland.
ThÂ» return to bimetallism would be of
no benefit to any class of people if it were
intrusted to the meddling and mnddling
of Democratic in com potency.
It is asserted that Boies had a brother
in the Union army, but Major McKinlev
wÂ»s himself la the army. This country
has had enough of men who were patri
otic by substitute.
This country took a long step backward
when it intrusted the Government to a re
actionary party, bat in tai* campaign i;
will recover the lost ground and hereafter
the cry will be alwaysâ forward. *
While Democrats are splitting the â¢ fac
tionÂ« into fractions, Republicans are everr
whexe uniting and getting into line, anil.
ai a consequence, business has an assur
ance of coming prosperity and looks for
ward to a speedy revival of trade in all
departments of Industry.
The frequent visits to McKialey's home
by delegations, not only of men but of
carnest-miaded fronuÂ»n, show the per
sonal popularity Of the man and attest
the esteem lv w titan be is held by the
whole peopto, This" popularity will have
its influence la the campaign and the
voters will cast their ballots for the man
they honor at well U the measures they
advocate.
THE INDIVIDUAL'S WORK.
The importance of individual effort in a
political campaign la not sufficiently con
iidered by most people. This is especially
true of Republicans wtien it is pretty gen
erally believed that their party will have
a "walk-over." river since the St. Louis
convention there has been a feeling in the
ranks of the party that Mr. McKinley
would Imve a majority so large that the
Democracy would have reason to doubt
that it was in the race. Now, it is just
this kind of wild ami foolish talk, and act
ing upon it, that will defeat the Republi
can ticket, if it is defeated. And, again,
the Republican rank and tile and leaders
had better make up their minds that vic
tory next November is not to be secured by
lounging upon rosy beds of ease mean
while. No matter who is Dominated at
Chicago, the Democracy la going to put
up as good a fight as it knows how. The
new bosses who have got hold of the
machinery of the Democratic party are
boiling over and will continue to boil over
with enthusiasm, and of a kind that is so
contagious that ii is sure to inoculate
pretty much all the rank and tile.
Then, again, there is a disposition on the
part of a great many Republicans to
console themselves with the belief that
the public has suffered so severely under
Democratic rule that everybody wants a
change and thai everybody will vote for
MoKinley. The very next belief that will
be entertained by such reasoners is almost
certain to be that "the Republican major
ity will be so great anyway I will take no
active part in the campaign." Only one
or two of that kind in each neighborhood
would be enough to insure the defeat of
the Republican ticket, and all such people
would be less harmful to the party if ;.. jy
wore to go over to the enemy.
Moreover, it will not do to put much
faith in dissensions in the Democratic
party. Democrats will pull hair and de
nounce everything and everybody, but it
is a "yaller-dog" party and any kind of a
ticket goes on election-day. A largo Baal
em contingent will bolt the Chicago nom
ination, no doubt, but their States would
go Republican anyway. while in the al
ways Democratic States the party is as
likely as not to hold its own. It will not
do, therefore, for Republicans to permit
themselves to become apathetic on the
ground that the Democratic party is dead
and that the election of Mr. McKinley will
bo merely a matter of easy-going form.
The Democracy is far from being dead.
The new leaders of the Democratic party
are wagering their political salvation upon
the contest, and Republicans everywhere
had better make up their minds that they
have work to do.
To properly organize for battle every
member of the party should not only uo
on duty, but teel that he is aosolutely neV
aaamry to victory. It is tue enthusiasm of
the individual that starts and keeps aiive
party a] irit, and it is tho individual who
votes, if it j s the desire of Republicans
that William McKinley should be tbe next
I'resident they will have to work in their
individual capacity a < Wflil a* collectively.
Parading the streets ami attending public
meetings are notonly necessary but obliga
tory, for great good comes of that kind of
campaign work, but victory is oftener due
to the efforts of the individual in a mis-
Bionauyaort of way. it is not good pol
itics to wait until the 'â¢formal opening of
the campaign. Let the informal work of
the individual be beguti now, and let him
grow in enthusiasm for the success of the
Republican part} from day to day. There
will be no room for spectators in the "holy
show" that is to be made of the Democracy.
THE GOOD OF DEMOCRACY.
In their appeal to the honor and self
respect of delegates to hold fast to the tra
ditions of the party, Mr. Whitney and his
confreres do not exaggerate the dangers
which threaten it. It is true that the
Eastern delegates are centering their ef
forts upon the money question that there
may be no departure from the theory that
gold and only gold is the natural metal of
which to coin redemption money; but the
real struggle is to save the party from the
bauds of the Tillmana aud the Altjrelds of
practical politics. They see, as do all
thoughtful people see, that the ascendency
of such men in any party would be a
menace to the political and social safe
guards of the Nation. So long as such
men are restricted in their hurtful influ
ence to organizations of little numerical
strength their power for evil is not BO
great; but when it comes to dominating
one of the great political parties of the
country it is time the better element of
that party was pointing out the danger of
such leadership and warning against it.
But every advocate of individual free
dom and liberty under law should pray as
fervently as Mr. Whitney and his con
freres that the Democratic party may be
delivered from the influence which is just
now dominating its deliberations. The
Democratic party is as necessary to the
Republican party as the Republican party
is necessary to the Nation, and the freer it
is from unwholesome theories of govern
ment the stronger is" the Republican party
and the better wilt be its administration
of theaflalrs of the country. Were there
no strong and in a measure worthy op
ponent of the Republican party it would
be carried very far. astray from us true
mission by the selfish designs of ambi
tious men. The country needs the Repub
lican party because its purpose contem
plates tne betterment of National ami in
dividual environment, but it would fall
into degeneracy were it not continually
threatened with overthrow by another
party. Its leaders are not different from
other human being?, and the closer they
are watched by the leaders of another
party, who are constantly on tne alert for
cause for their indictment and trial at the
bar of public opinion, the closer will they
keep to the standard of conduct wnich
makes tbe Republican party, in its princi-
lea of Government, the strong right arm
of the Nation's weal.
If. therefore, the Democratic party
should be captured by its Altgelds and
Tillmans and their* theories of govern
ment adopted as the principles of the
ptrty, the Democracy would exert no
more of a restraining influence upon the
Republican party than anarchism now
does. There would be but one great
political party in the countryâ the Re
publican partyâ and through sins of omis
sion end sins of commission it would in
time become the people's master instead
of their servant. A* we have "said, the
Democratic party is needful in the
strength of it 3 highest and purest motives
to the Republican party, just as the wise,
prudent and patriotic motives of the Be
publican party are needed in practical
application la the conduct ot the affairs
lof the Nation. Hence uo Republican
I should look with satisfaction upon the
surrender of the traditions and ' the prin
ciples of the Democratic party to men
whose theory of government gives the lie
to the Declaration of Independence;
whose definition of "liberty" is 'every
one shall be a law onto himself," and
with whom the greatest "patriot" is he
who most successfully resists the authority
of the courts. Harmful as the Democratic
party has been to the country, it would
be a thousand time* more dangerous in

M'KINLEY AND THE PEOPLE.
I:i the frequent delegations that now
almost every day visit the home of Mc-
Kinley we can see an unmistakable mani
festation of the tendency or the people of
the country at Inrge. These delegations
are made uj. of all classes of persons.
Men who have hitherto been known as
Democrats or as Pouu lists are among
them. They represent, in fact, the gen
eral sentiment of the country and express
the common esteem among the people for
McKinley as a man as well as for the
champion of protection and prosperity.
These evidences of a personal liking for
McKinley show the hold he has upon the
popular heart. The people regard him as
one of themselves. They look upon him
as a friend and have â  friend's desire to
see him, to bear him talk and to take him
by the hand. He receives them in that
same spirit of Americanism. He ifl not
exclusive. Hfl meets them with a wel
come which they recognize as coming
from the heart, and talks to them of woik
and waÂ»;es, of honest labor and its right
ful rewards, of the comfort and the wel
fare of the American home and of the
duty of the Government to provide by
adequate legislation to protect the work
shop and the home against foreign com
petition.
These friendly gatherings and friendly
talks ns of one neighbor to another will
have a threat influence upon the public
muni. Every workingman cannot go to
sc<- MeKinley, but ail can read the story
from day to duy of how lie receives other
men and what he Bays to them. Thus the
effect of each of these meetings between
representatives of the people and the great
leader will be widely felt, ,md the popular
mind, already inclined toward the soldier
oaadidateand patriot statesman, will grow
more and mora favorable to him as they
i-ee bin revealed as the plain-spoken,
honest -minded, simple-mannered, true
hearted American that he is in all his
dealing wi;h his fellow-man.
No one ever hears of delegations of
wortitig people calliritr upon Grover Cleve
land. There is a sign warning the people
from the grounds at Bunaxdi Bay. A
policeman, stops the way at the gate of
Woo Hey to all but the favored few. The
bond-dealers of Wall street find easy ac
msf to the home of the Democratic leader,
but workingmen are shut out. It is not
accidental that tbe Democratic leader is
so widely different in this respect from the
great Republican. Democracy does not
stand for work or wages, for labor well
paid and the American home. Therefore
it has no use for the leadership of a man
whose sympathies are with tbe people.
â¢Keep off the grass "is a good enough
sign for Deruocnu-v.
Republicans throughout the Union can
find abundant assurances of coming vic
tory in the evidences these visiting delega
tions afford of tne spontaneous turning of
the people to McKinley. They make clear
the fact that the leader of thÂ« movement
for protection and prosperity is the type
of man that the peop'e delight to honor.
They will follow him with love for his per
sonal character as well as loyalty to his
cause, and so u> the polls lor him with the
same ardor they now show in calling at
his home.
WAR DECLARED IN CHICAGO.
The Democratic National Committee,
by a vote of 2tJ to US, riuiis; the gauntlet
down to the free-silverites yesterday after
noon with as much vieionsness and em
phasis as if they had fired it at them from
a Kr.ipp gun. The selection of senator
Hill for temporary chairman by a vote of
S3 to 23 was a deli to the majority, and it
was quite enough to give the silveritos to
understand that Vie goldites were ready
to Eight it out. but there was nothing in
tbe selection of Mr. EEill that tould be
construed into meaning an affront to any
individual, for custom gives tbe right to
the National Committee to name the
temporary orfteerÂ« of the convention.
The real deli, however, was in seating
the entire anti-Bryan delegation from NeÂ«
braÂ«ka. Brvau naÂ« been working like a
beaver for two years to secure favorable
mention from tbe National Convention.
Anything from ttie nomination for Presi
dent down to temporary chairman would
suit him. By joining with the Populists
two year* ago to elect Holcomb Governor
c : .N ( >L-ra>ka, he pot enough help in return
to put himself in as the bos? of the irregu
lar Democratic State Central Committee,
and yeÂ«terday, while he was marchine his
Nebraska followers from the train to the
"Bryan headquarter?,' and while the
F residential bee was buzzing louder than
ever, the National Committee voted that
he Had no right in Chicagoâ that is, he
had no connection with worK ot holding a
Democratic convention. Had the goidites
polled Boie>" nose, Blaad'i r.ose. Ait
geld's i.ose and Tillmaa't nose, they
would not have created any more bouide
than they iiiu by refusing to recoenire
Uryan and his delegates as being eligible
to sit in a Democratic convention.
No douDt the affront put open Bryan
was in accordance with a deliberate plan
to force the tight from start to finish, and
in selecting Bryan the goldite? knew they
were slanehtering one of Altgeld's pet
lambs. It was certainly a bold and darinc
deed and it means that neither faction will
give or take quarter. Of coarse, the con
vention will seat Bryan and his delega
tion, although the courts nave decided
that his central committee is not the law
ful committee of the Democratic party of
Nebraska. It i* quite safe to predict that
Senator Hill will not be permitted to pre
side as temporary chairman. He certainly
will not if Bryan can help it; but then
Bryan has no faith at all in Boies' conver
sion to the cause of silver, which Boies
and his following know, and on that ac
count the lowa man's friends might rally
to the support of the National Committee
in refusing to recognise the Bryan delega
tion. Anyhow, the tight is on and no one
wants peace.
BARBED-WIRE FORTIFICATIONS.
General Weyler's generalship has evolved
to where it begins to dawn upon his
obtu?e mind that nis Spanish soldiers are
greatly in need of a new device to protect
them from a**su!t and battery at the
hands of tbe rebel?, and hiÂ» now proposes
to run a line of barbed-wire fence along
hi? trocha. A line of barbed wire is a new
kind of fortification, but it is doubtful if
the insurgents will think that it cannot be
overcome. It would be just like the rebels
to send an advance guard to la&e down
the fence and lay it away for farm usÂ«
when the war is over.
But that, is no: tae only evidence of
Weyler's boundless genius that has been
unearthed recently. His bank account
was running low, and by permission of
the Madrid Government he nas ordered
one of the Havana banks to "emit" $12,
-000.000 in paper. There does not appear
to be any provision for the redemption of
these notes other than about 20 per cent
of their lace rahxa in silver bullion, which
Spain agrees to send over later on.
If the war ever ends in favor of
Spain and commerce revives a cer
tain percentage of the income derived
from imports and exports will be applied
to the redemption fund. But it makes no
difference whether there is a redemption
fund provided or not tho notes are pooa
and everybody takes themâ except Wey
ler. To the edict which orderea tho bans
to "emit" $12,000,000 in notes t >ere was
attached an intimation that refusal to
take them would be considered "an act of
sympathy with the rebels," which, being
interpreted, means death by shooting to
all who are not willing to receive the
"emit" at face value.
In this connection it is well to remind
the public that President Cleveland can
not suspend his iishinc operations long
enough to give Cuba a hearing. Perhaps
he will get around to it after he has caught
all the tish that are willing to be caugnt,
but meanwhile the resolution of Congress
urging the President to recognize the bel
ligerency of the patriots is getting rusty,
and the indications are that the Cubans
will h:ive to manage some way to exist
until Mr. McKinley relieves Mr. Cleveland
of the duties of President.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
McKISLEY'S IDEAL.
Exgu-u Apprehension Coscaaanea Ocr Sil
ver agitation.
Tot?ie Editor of the San Franciico â Sir:
In common with all citizens who seek first the
welfare of our country, I have read with seri
ous interest the abie address of Major McKin
ley to the notification committee on accepting
the nomination of the Republican party as its
candidate for the Presidency. He has now
spoken in well-considered terms on the finan
cial issue. As a Lincoln Republican and Popu
list I accept, with slight change, this pivotal
declaration:
"The American people hold the financial
honor of our Government as sacred as our flag
and can be relied noon to guard i: with the
same sleepless vigilance." This was McKin
ley's ideal. The change in this ideal which I
desire as a Populist is this: "The American
people hold the paper money of oar Govern
ment as sacred as our nag, and can be relied
upon to guard it wi:a the same sleepless vigi
lance." The time is drawin;: near when this
will be profoundly true, and then, like the
nag. our National money will become, as Cae
sar's money siood lor Caesar, an emblematic
expression of the Nation's honor aad au
thority and patriotism and power and match
less resources.
That is the Populist ideal as I understand it,
and I claim that ii is more truly -American,
more patriotic, more philosophical, aud, in
deed, more Republican and mure Democratic
as Lincoln and JcSersoa understood party
principles, than Major MeKialev's really fine
sentiment on "finaacia: honor,"' and I chal
lenge any goidite Republican or Democrat 10 '
(ay that it is act all I claim, nay, far more, }
Even gold-blind prejudice itself will not deny j
that Major McKiaiey's felicitous declaration is
weak ana savors too much c: Wail street as
compared with my Populist modification c* it.
At ail events my challenge stands and is made
without limitation.
If this seems bold or indiscreet, let him eon- |
sider well who inclines to accept my challenge, i
for the decision will rest wiihthe people, acd t
they begin to understand the mosey question.
But I wi.l ro yet farther and say; Give the
American people a paper money of that kind,
based on thÂ« seatimeat that upholds the nag.
and b*ck It as we co the nag by the honor, the
authority, the patriotism, the power ana the
match. resources of the Nation, and give
them enough oi it to do the business of the
country on a cash basis, and the "financial
honor of the Government" will need no
'â¢sleepless vigilance" to "guard it" egainst the
fold- power of our own country, or against any
gold-mad cation on earth. I challenge any
tola-.:* to say me n*y to thÂ»t delegation also.
These are some of the thoughts which came
to me as I read ana then meditated upon
Major Me if y 's address this Fourth of July
aiternoon; but I defer other reference to this
masterly &daress that I may a&k any Repub
lican wno fears that the success 'of silver
men at this time may be Iraught with danger
to our commerd&l aad industrial interests ;o
read with due care the prognosticatioas of the
great ncacci&l journal of England and the
lew lines of cemmess by the Philadelphia
Item, from which I copy nnder th* sif nineant !
title, "free Silver and American Progress,'* as
follows:
An editorial ia the London Commerce, a
recognized trade authority, a champion of
gold monometallism Jar EaglÂ«ad,aadci*imiag
the .rcuiation in the world, has caused
eossiderahle t&lk amoag business men. From
i; the follow ins extract is takes: '
â¢â¢Leaving the question of tariil for a moment
let us consider waat a bimet&Uist America will ,
meas for cs. Ia the first place it wiil mean an '
immediate premium on American expo rtt.
The effect of coining silver at the proposed ra
tio wocld, in all probability, bring about a
great 'boom* in [Americas] manufactures of all
kinds. Wage 3 would rise considerably, but
ihe experience of other countries goes to show
that they could not rise in proportion to the
advantage which exporters would derive who
sent their goods to r gold-using country, to
wit, to the United Kingdom. The manufact
urers of tbe United States \vou:d not bu quite
in the same position of vantage as the agricul
turist of the Argentine nor the exporters in In
dia, but they would have a sufficient leverage
over the manufacturers here to turn the scale
in every trade where now there is a doubt
which way the market trends. In tin plates,
in many kinds of machinery, inclueiug some
01 the very heaviest, in leatiier and in many
sundry manufactures where the British pro
ducer can with difficulty hold his own, the ef
fect of the change would be decisive. Then
this policy [of free coinaee of silver] is also a
bribe to the [American] farmers. American
meat â live catile being prohibitedâ also wheat
and all farm produce suitable for exportation,
could come over [to England] in greatly aug
mented auantities, for ihe difference in the
exchange wouid moan such an addition of

LADY'S JACKET BASQUE, WITH
FRENCH BACK
A shape at once stylish, becoming and ea?y
to make is not always attainable. The model
shown here boasts all these qualities. The
basque or peplum being sewn on separate, i
savins: much worry over the fit at the waist
line, and takes less material than a basque cut
in one with the body. The French or seamless
back, with side gores. Is very stylish. The leg
o' mutton sleeves are finished by cuffs that
flare in the proper style. The double r ever s i
are chic and admit of a variety of trimming
Separate waists of silk are made in this shape
as well as waists of costumes. A silk of black
and white in many stripes had revers of em
broidered batiste over apple-green satin. The
reÂ«t was of white emtjroidered mull. The belt
was of the green satin. The collar of silk had
a box-pleat of the satin overhanging at both
sides of the back. Cuffs of batiste over the
green satin.
A brown mohair had vest of brown and white
Brow eilk. The revers and cuff were of
brown covered with heavy white lace. Pearl
buttons overlaid with gold filigree finished the
edges of coat below the revere.

LAST OF M OLD
TIME CLIPPER,
Claimed by the Sea After
Thirty Odd Years of
Service.
SHE WENT ON THE ROCKS
A Year Ago the Melrose Was
One of the Prettiest Barks
in the Bay.
ARRIVAL"! OF THE AUSTRALIA.
Sausalito "Boys" Are Laughing Over
the Joke They Had en Host
McCormick.
The old bark Melrose has probably made
her last voyage. Thirty years ago she was
one of the fleet which made America
famous en the high seas, but now she is
high and dry on the rocks in Puget Sound
and the chances are that she will be
broken up and sold for junk. She was
about 1000 tons burden and was built in
East Boston in 1863.
In the days of long ago the Melrose was
one of the clippers running between Bos
ton and Liverpool. When larger and
speedier vesseis were built she was put on
the run between New York and San Fran
cisco, and finally, as old age crept on, she
was turned into a collier. For years she
ran between here and Vancouver, B. C,
but some months ago she was loaded with
lumber and sent to Australia. As ?he
passed through the Golden Gate every
man on the front admired the old bark,
and as the tug cast her off and sail was
made on her she made as pretty a picture
as has been seen anywhere near the Heads
in many a day.
From California the Melrose went to
Port Pirie and there unloaded, rrom
there she went to Newcastle, N. S. \\\,
and loaded coal for Central America.
After dischar ing and reloading she went
to Puget Sound and was on her way out
with another load of lumber, when she
went ashore at Sooke Inlet. According to
last dispatches she was in a dangerous
position and the underwriters considered
that she would be a total loss.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia arrived from Honolulu yesterday,
and there was the usual trouble between
the quarantine officers. Dr. Chalmers was
on time and boarded the steamer off Fort
Point. CaptainiHoudlette thinking every
thing was all right went direct to the
wharf and paid no attention to tne whistles
of the Sternberg. By the time Folsom
street was reached the skipper saw that
something was wrong and refused to allow
the gangplank to be put out. Finally Dr.
Blue got aboard and then everything was
straightened out.
The Australia brought the following
cabin passengers:
Mrs. Professor Alexander, Mrs. H. Z. Austin,
Mrs. H. P. Baldwin and three children, Major
Bartlett and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Basford, Mrs.
R. B. Brenham and child, J. K. Burket, W. J.

James Torbett.
Everybody had a splendid time on tne
Fourth. It was a truly democratic affair,
and the sailors, firemen, steerage passen
gers, cabin passengers and officers all
joined in making the day a success. Pro
fessor Dillon of Indiana delivered the ora
tion, and J. D. Hayne of Honolulu made
a patriotic speech. The most enjoyable
event on the programme, however, was
the hula hula, as danced by R. P. Greer.
Early m the morning Chief Officer Lawless
fired a National salute, but the first two
shots were a failure, as the powder was
wet. Everything was soon got in working
order, however, and the twenty-one guns
boomed in rapid succession. When it
came to the fireworks the ship looked
more like a Fourth of July procession than
anything else. The first bomb that was
fired struck tne water and ricocheited
back on board. It happened to land on
the back of the ship's cat, and Black Tom
has not been seen since. Cnief Lawless
and other members of the crew are still
searching for the poor animal.
Flort nee Blytiie-Hinckley and her hus
band made a tour of the bay in the launch
j Amy yesterday. Henry Peterson showed
them the sights and finally landed the

The Sausalito and San Rafael boys are

1 the steamers bausalito and San Kafat 1.
Friday afternoon last he met "Jim" Tay
lor on the street and said to him: "Jim,
take my card and lot the boys on the boat
have a Fourth of July drink with me."
"Jim" faithfully obeyed orders, and ttie
card was used again and again until every
body on board had bad half a dozen drinks
and McCorm ck's demijohns were empty.
"Hurrah boys," shouted Taylor as the boat
entered the Sausalito slip. "I have had
passes on railroads, streetcars and
steamers, but this is the first time I've
ever had one on a bar and it's still good.
Let's have another Fourth of July drink."
There was nothing left but sodawater.
McCormick now wants the pass back,
but Taylor refuses to give it up.
Several Custom-house officers were in a
quandary yesterday. The Hartley was tak
ing them to the Mail dock when her shaft

POPULISTS READY
FOR ST. LOUIS,
They Are Mainly Farmers
Who Go to the National
Convention.
THE LIST OF DELEGATES
The St. Louis Conventions Are
Veiled Mysteries to the
Party.
SO IS THE STATE CAMPAIGN.
Mny Delegates Interested in the Big
Convention of Co-operative
Societies.
The Populist State leaders have per
fected arrangements for tne trip of the
California delegation to the National Con
vention which will convene in St. Louis
on the 22d inst.
The Caliiornia Populists are as much at :
sea regarding what will be done at their .
National Convention as the California !
Democrats were concerning theirs two
weeks ago. To the whole Nation the pros- |
pects of the Populist and silver National
conventions of St. Ixiuis are as vague, fate- I
ful and full of varied possibilities as has |
been the Chicago convention, which is i
now the cynosure of all political eyes.
Now, we may hardly guess who the Popu
lists and Silver men will nominate at St.
Louis, presage much of tneir platform, or
at this moment foreshadow the political
relations among the three anti-McKinley I
parties that will develop within three
weeks.
The Populist and Silver National con
vention?, which are to meet on the same
date, will probably surpass in the num
bers drawn to the convention city and
likely in political significance the creat
convention now in full blast by Lake !
Michigan.
There will be more to the Bt. Louis con
vention events than the definite National
machines of the Popuiist party and the j
somewhat inchoate silver party. Various
"reform" elements and various organized
expressions ol discontent will cut a figure
on the side. Political history will be made
at St. Louis as well as at Chicago.
California will be represented at the
Populist convention by thirty-nine dele
gates and at ihe Silver convention by
about the Fame number. Quite a number
who are not delegates will also go.
The Populist and silver delegations will j
leave on the 16ih inst., but they will not i
go on the same train as was the original
plan formulated througu their community â¢
of interests. Railroad hustlers are re- i
sponsible for this separation. The list of '
silver delegates is not yet completely
made up.
The Populist delegation will leave on
the morning of the 16ih inst. and proceed
by way of Ogden and Denver, where the
Utah and Colorado delegations will join
j them, going thence to Sti Louis by way oi
i the Missouri Pacific. The silver delegates
will leave on the evening of the 16th and
go by the Union Pacific route.
The Populist State Executive Commit
tee which met yesterday bad for its par
ticular business the filling of the places of
such delegates elected at the State Conven
tion as could not go, but very few of the
delegates reported that they could not go,
although the expense of the trip is a seri
ous matter with a majority of them.
They are representative Populists who
compose the delegation. Four-fifths of
them are farmers who are not used to tak
ing a hand &t tne wheel of tne ship of
state, but they have ideas of their own.
There are four lawyers, one doctor, sev
eral workingmen, no merchants and four
editors. The editors are: M. E. Dittmar
of the Redding Searchlight, delegate at
large; Dr. R. E. Curran of the Los Ange
les Civic Review, G. H. Gilstrap of the
Tulare Citizen and If. W. Wilkins of the
New Charter, San Francisco. The lawyers j
are: T. V. Cator of San Francisco, Alfred
Daggett of Visalia, Henry C. Dillon of j
Los Angeles and Mr. Welcn of San Jose, j
Among the delegates is J. C. Waybrigut
of Grass Valley, a farm laborer who four
years ago drove 200 miles to attena the
State Convention. W. A. Vann of Colma, '
Populist nominee for Coneress two years
ago, is another of the delegates. C. N.
Harris, secretary of the Bimetallic Union;
James Ashbury Johnson, the writer; J. C.
Walker, a shoemaker, and John C. Gore
are among the dele ates from San Fran
cisco. E. M. Wardail, chairman of ihe j
State Central Committee and one of the
four delegates at large, will likely be chair
man of the delegation.
The delegation will not put on any frills
or take along any wines. It will travel in
tourist sleepers and wear cheap but pretty
badges of ti;e California poppy color. 1.
y. Cator, M. E. Dittman and three other
delegates are now in the East. Cator will
be early in St. Louis and will look after
the California hea -{quarters, which will be
at the Holland House.
The delegation will arrive in St. Louis
on the 20th inst., in time to attend a een
eral conference on direct legislation, which
will be held on the 21st. This conference
has been called by Ignatius Donnelly, E.
M. Wardail and others. Those especially
interested in the direct legislation propa- |
canda, as most of the leading California
Populists are, will urge this as one of the J
chief planks in the People's party plat
form this year.
Ignatius Donnelly, the eloquent farmer,
writer and agitator of Minnesota, will
likely be one of the Populist heavy guns
who will stump California when tne cam
paign gets hot. He and E. M. Wardail are
old personal friends, and Wardail expects
to get him out here lor a stumping tour.
Another side issue in which many of the :
California delegates are interested is the i
great and probably to-be-notable conven
tion of co-operative societies and people
to be opened on the 24th inst. This will
be a grand effort to unite in some way, or
rather to combine the efforts of the great
number of co-operative organizations in
the country. The Farmers' Alliance Ex
change, tfie Labor Exchange, the Amer
ican branches of the Rochedaie Co-opera
tive Association and the Grangers are but
four of the heterogeneous collection of co
operative movements to be represented.
California affords co-operation in a great i
variety of forms, having forty or more co- i
operative sooieties running flourmills,
tanneries, labor exchanges, mercantile en
terprises and so on. These co-otÂ»erative
people are "reformers" and anti-monopo
lists and the convention will be semi
politicai. J. If. Moore of San Francisco,
purchasing agent for the Farmers' Al
liance, and W. W. Wilkins of San Jose
will be leading representatives of Califor
nia co-operation.
The following is the list of PoDUlist
delegate* as it stood last night:
At largeâ Alfred Daggitt, Visalia; John S.
Dore, Fresno; K. M. Wardail, Monrovia; M. E.
Dittmar, Redding.

At St. Louis the delegation will fill any
vacancies that may appear there. Some
of those in the list given above were ap
pointed by the executive committee yes
terday.
At the meeting of the executive com
mittee yesterday, the finance committee,
of which John S. Dore of Fresno is chair
man, considered the money matters of the
party without taking any steps of great
importance. Chairman Wardail says that
the committee has not begun any special
efforts to raise money yet, and will not do
so until after the convention. The com
mittee has a small debt two years old
jvhich it will pay very soon, and the policy
| this year will be to noi go tosl of expense
| without having the cash on hand to meet
: it. There will be no debt when the cam
paign is over.
"We are all at sea retarding the State
campaign," taid Chairman Wardail yes
terday, "because so many things depend
on the National conventions. It's all
guessing in the dark just now in talking
about toe probable future. There will he
no combination with the Democrats, that
is quite sure. I think that the gold men
! will wield v strong influence at Chicago
I and leave their impress on the work of the
j convention.
"If the silver men at St. Louis indorse
! the Democratic nominee, I believe it will
1 defeat silver. The Populists and the inde
pendent silver men can carry California,
j or the Populists and silver Republicans
can carry it. I believe that the silver Re
publicans will vote tne Populist ticket this
year and 1 hat the Democrats cannot put
up a man who will i oil as many votes in
this State as McKinley.
"There are so many contingencies ahead
that it is impossible to guess who t .c Pop
ulists will nominate at St. Louis. There
is no candidate yet prominently to the
front. Teller may be the nominee it he
will come and stand on our platform. We
will make a platform that any honest man
who wants reform can stand on. We will
naturally give the South due considera
tion in the selection of our nominee."
CAPS THE CLIMAX.
O'Brlen'i July Clearance Opens to an
Immense Crowd and 18 Pronounced
the Greatent Harcain Sale of All.
As usual, O'Brien's annual July bargain
sale openedto an immense crowd yesterday.
And "a crowd" at O'Brien's means a vast
number of people ; for any one of the many |
broad aisles of the firm's mammoth estab- |
lishment will accommodate many more i
than an average retail house. But the I
crowd was there and its magnitude belied I
the general belief that everyone is out of!
townâ in fact, as Mr. O'Brien said, "it un- j
mistakably proved that there are always
plenty of buyers if the inducements are <
strongenough."
In this case there was no question as to
the unusual character of the inducements, \
the entire remainder of the linn's spring ',
and suniinr r stock of dry goods and cloaks
having been marked down f or clearance
to figures that In many cases were less I
tnan half original selling prices.
Nothing â not even the latest styles and
novelties â was spared from the sacrifice,
and the eagerness of the throngs that sur
rounded every table and lined every
counter when the store was visited in the
afternoon stiowed that buyers thoroughly
recognized the unusual opportunity pre
sentt-d, ana fully realized that the goods
could not last "long at the "eiving away"
prices prevailing.
Judging from its auspicious opening and
the radical measures adopted for its con
tinuance the ultimate success of this great
sale becomes an assured fact, and it bids
fair to be Jong remembered as the greatest
of all O'Brien's great bargain sales.
LADY TEACHERS
MUST NOT MARRY
The Sudden Revival of an
Objectionable Old
Rule.
IT PROMOTES CHANGES
Lawyers and School Directors
Seriously Doubt Its Le
gality.
HARD TIMES FOR THE GIRLS
They Must New Make Up Their Minds
Between a Husband anrf a
Position.
When a lady school-teacher of San Fran
cisco makes up her mmd to take to her
heart a husband, her resignation from the
department is compulsory. The rule was
formally adopted at the latest session of
the Board of Educaiion and is now in full
lorce and effect. Tne unmarried ladies
now teaching in the public schools are
much more numerous than the wives and
widows, and tliis news is likely to take
them by surprise.
Still they must mate up their minds
that it will be impossible under the pres
ent administration, at least, to enjoy sim
ultaneously the luxury of a husband and a
position in the department. This, in the
opinion of the school sa.'es, would be de
cidedly "too much of a good thing "
So the only course for the fascinating
young schoolma'ams who are matrimoni
ally inclined will be to grin and bear it.
Lut r on, when a lot of new directors have
been elected, there may be a chan>jÂ« and
the unpopular rule may be rescinded.
Until that time the handsome and accom
plished young teachers must wait or marry
men with lots of money. Then they
would probably be willing to leave the de
partment any way and make room for
some of their younger and less fortunate
sisters.
"We enacted or rather re-enacteil this
marriage rule," said Director C. A. Mur
dock, "for politic reasons. It was adopted
by an almost unanimous vote, although I
think t at Directors Clinton and Hender
son are against it. Director Comte, who,
as you know, is a lawyer, advised us that
if ever taken into the courts it would, in
all probability, be declared to be unconsti
tutional, still he voted for it.
"You see wf already have a sufficient
number of married teache-s in the depart
ment to see to the minds and morals of
the primary children, and their positions
are not, of course, disturbed by this new
ruie. Ido <iot know that its adoption will
make any appreciable difference in the
number of vacancies occurring from time
to time. As a eeneral thing, when a
younc cirl in the d< partnient marries she
resignsvoluntarily, but recently teachers
have been intermarrying to a rather alarm
ing extent, and we concluded that it was
about time to enforce this rule. It re
mains to be seen what will be the result."
Some years ago this rule, making the
resignation of lady teachers compulsory
upon their marriage, was originally intro
duced by a Democratic Board of Eluca
tion for the ex\ ress purpose of creating
vacancies to be rillea witn the friends and
followers of tne directors. Many secret
marriages and more or less scandal ensued
and the objectionable rule was subse
quently rescinded. Even at that time the
legality of it was seriously doubted, but
for obvious reasons no teacher has ever yet
taken an appeal to the courts.
THE PARK THEATER.
National Iron Work* Place n Second At-
tachment on Box- fflco Receipts.
The Park Theater on Grove street, be
tween Polk street and Van Ness avenue,
succumbed last evening to the second at
tachment placed on the receipts of the
box office by Marshutz & Cantrell, pro
prietors of the National Iron Works of this
City.
Thursday evening of last week this firm
of machinists got the Sheriff to seize the
box office, and t>.e sum of $10 75 was then
obtained by the firm. The attachment
was released and business was resumed by
William E. Johns, lessee and manager of
the theater.
Last evening the Sheriff again appeared
on the scene. The playgoers who hnd ex
pected to pay 25 cents each for the joy of
seeing the only Dan McCarthy, Irish
comedian, as the "Pride of Mayo," were
grievously disappointed to read an an
nouncement on the outside that the
theater would be closed until next Mon
day evening.
The amount of money due the National
Iron Work", according to the attachment
papers, is $72. _

Men From the Flassh p Philadelphia
and Frcm the Presidio to Take
Part in the Ceremony.
The arrangements for the calebration ie
this City on Thursday next of the semi
centennial anniversary of the conquest of
California and tt.e taking possession of
Yerba Buena, as San Fran-cisco was then
known, by Captain Montgomery of the
sloop-of-war Portsmouth are complete and
will be carried out at noon on that day.
There are to be two celebrations of the
conquest â one at Monterey to-day to cele
brate the conquest of California by the act
of Commodore John Drake Sloat in havine
the American nag raised at Monterey, and
the other in this City by the Exempt Fire
Company in commemoration ot the rais
ing of Old Giory on Portsmouth Square,
Last evening George T. Bohen, A. J,
Jessup, J. J. Guilfoyle, Godfrey Fisher
and James O'Donnell of the committee of
arrangements held a meeting in the ball
of the Exempts on Brenham place, when
what had been done was reviewed, and it
was decided to make a report to the com
pany at a meeting to be held to-night at
which every member is expected to be
present.
The programme as arranged is as fol
lows: As the bell sounds on the Central
station of the fire alarm system the flag
will be run to the masthead of the pole at
the head of the square by a detachment of
men from the Bagahip detailed for that
purpose by order of Admiral Beardslee;
the firing of a salute and the playing of
'"The fctar-spangled Banner" by the band.
Then James Bayard Whittemore Jr. will
read a copy of the proclamation that was
issued by "his great-grandfather. Commo
dore Sloat, upon the seizure of Monterey.
The band will then play "Hail, Colum
bia," after which Rabbi voananger will
deliver the oration, and the programme
will close with the rendering of the Na
tional hymn, "America."
The old double-decker hand engine, cov
ered with bunting, will be rolled to the
eastern sidewalk of Brenham place; the
piii form on which the old boys worked
the upper Drakes in days of yore will be
extended and serve as the rostrum for the
reader of the proclamation and the orator.
Under the shadow of the big double
decker there will be on exhibition the
pioneer engine " '49," that did service in
the days of the big conflagrations; and
there will also be shown a reel that was
once the property of Broderick Engine
Company No. 1 of the volunteer depart
ment. This is a curiosity which for twenty
eight years was under a shed in the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company's yard, near
Third and Townsend streets, where it was
kept for use in case of fire, and it has upon,
it several lengths of leather copper-riveted
hose that was in use long before carbon
ized rubber or canvas hose came into
service.
There are many in this City who when
they see this on Thursday will for the first
time see that kind oi fire hose.
There will be a detachment of men from
the Philadelphia, soldiers from the Pre
sidio, members of the Naval Battal'on and
military, and naval officers, State and City
and County officers who have been in
vited.
After the ceremony the invited guests
will be treated to a collation in the hall of
the Exempts.
THE LABOR UN.ONS.
The Plasterers Have Admitted Appren

The Building Trades Council's new work

have been issued to all journeymen in the
affiliated unions to turn in their old cards
and secure new ones.
Notice has been sent to all contractors
that no union plasterers will cover work
done by non-union lathers.
The Plasterers' Union met last night and
decided to admit apprentices into the
union free, but the young men will have
to pay "_'s cents a month dues. Each ap
prentice must serve lour years before he
can Decome a full-fledged journeyman, and
no contractor is allowed to employ more
than one apprentice. Even then he must
have been contracting at least a yeaT.

A choked sewer on California street
caused the destruction of considerable
material in the paintshop of Henry F.
Wagner, at t>;ss California street, during
Sunday night. When Mr. Wagner arrived
at his shop yesterday morning to resume
work he found his material floating about
on a pond of dirty water. First he was
puzzled to ascertain the cause of the sub
mersion, but an investigation soon con
vinced him that the trouble originated in
a defective sewer.
Pumps were called into requisition and

Assessor Siebe turned his books over to
the Board of Supervisors yesterday to as
sist that body in its deliberations as a
Board of Equalization, and at the same
time rendered a report in which he gave
the principal changes made during the
vast year in the assessment roll of San
Francisco.
The total valuation of property was in
creased over $32,000,000, the largest in
crease being on the banks and large cor
porations.
Mr. Siebe also sent a letter to the board
informing it that he does not believe the
allowance of a percentace of the collec
tions of taxes on personal property unse
cured by real estate is legal, and that the
59000 per centage allowed him by the law
has Been turned in to the City Treasurer.
The report, which is self-explanatory, is
as follows:
Assessor's Office, \
San Francisco, July 6, 1896. j
To the Honorable the Hoard 0/ Supcrrisors of
the City and County of San FranciscoâGentle
men: In compliance with So.
14,400 (third series) of your honorable body, I
herewith submit my annual report as City and
County Assessor, for the fiscal year ending
June 80, 1896.
On July ti I delivered to John A.Russell.
Esq., clerk of your board, the assessment-roll
<â¢: personal property, contained in seventeen
volumes, and secured personal property
nmounting to Â£53,40G,790. nd the real estate
assessment-roll, contained In fifty-four vol
umes, amounting to $276,919,241, of which
$187,578,691 was the assessment against land
and $89,340,550 was the assessment on im
provements, In addition to the above. I also
delivered one volume, containing assessments
for the payment of principal and interest on
Dupont-strcet bonds, four volumes ot indexes
nnd fifty-four block books of maps of all the
lands and subdivisions of real estate within
iho*CUy and County of Han Francisco.
The personal property roll last year footed
up 786,542, while the real-estate roll j
amounted to $265,018,605. We therefore find
a net increase of $32,530,884 on personal
property and real estate over last year, the en
tire assessment last year having been Â£327,

TIIE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 7, 1896.
AT THE OPERA
AND PLAYHOUSE.
Brilliant Opening of the
Tivoli's Grand Opera
Season.
NATALI'S GREAT HIT.
"Americans Abroad" Calls a Fine
Audience to the Cali
fornia.
AT THE OTHER THEATERS.
Meritorious OpeniDg Production of
"A Money Order" at the Grand
Opera-House.
The first performance of the grand opera
season, which opened last night at the
Tivoli, far surpassed all expectations.
The audience was taken by surprise, car-
Mme. Natnli, Who Made a Ilit at the Tivoli Last Mght as Lucia.
ried off its feet, as it were, and showed its
| appreciation by applause that was some
times more demonstrative than timely,
! for nearly every finale was drowned in the
; noise of an applauding multitude. It
seemed as if the crowded house could not
wait until the curtain was down to express
its satisfaction.
Of course grand opera has been essayed
time and again at the Tivoli, but grand
opera chortled by artists of operetta is a
thine to be shunned and avoided by lovers
of lyric art. Last nignt the genuine article
was given, and people first marveled and |
then rejoiced, for they had not expected I
so much. The very limit to which their
hopes had soared was to hear the dear old
"Lucia di Lammermoor'' ground out by
faded, tired artists like the poor Tavary
people.
But there was nothing faded â no trace
of barn-storming about the principals last
night. On the contrary, their voices were
fresh and method excellent, and their act
ing much better than one demands or ex
pects from people in operas as old as !
' "Lucia." And to cap it all, or lather as j
| the fundamental basis of a good deal of
the success, Gnstave Hinricns conducted
an augmented orchestra with sympathetic
skill and care for his singers.
Mme. Louise a tali, as the Lucia, had,
of course, more opportunity than the other ;
vocalists of distinguishing herself, for I
"Lucia" is essentially a prima - donna!
opera.
She quite succeeded in her mission. Dur
! ing the three Lucia acts the admiration
| for her went on increasing in a steadily ,
j growing crescendo till it broke into a per
fect storm of enthusiasm at the end of the
mad scene.
Mme. Natali has & flute-like voice of
good vibrant quality. Her execution is
j charmingly facile, and she has consider
| able coloratura, ail of which qualities go i
! to maKe up a good Lucia. (She entirely
avoided the mistake of trying to make the
1 part declamatory. Indeed, her singing
I was remarkable for its delicacy and finish.
Mme. Natali's acting was intelligent and
effective, and "Lucia" does not give scope |
i for more.
Fernando Michaelena showed such fine
I dramatic qualities, both of vocal and stage
methods, that one longed to hear him in a
! more modern role. His voice is a robust
| tenor, of good compass and quality; he
sang all his part well, shining especially
in the recitations.
Signor Mauriel de Vries, the barytone,
has a warm, round voice, which he uses
| excellently. His acting, like that of the |
new principals, was good, and his make- I
: up was so dark and dreadful that even j
j some Japanese spectators in the gallery
knew Henry Ashton was a villain as soon
;as he appeared. bignor Abramoff is still
j remembered as one of the few effective
j artists in the Tavary Company last winter.
He sang Raymond very effectively last ,
* night, completing a cast of principals :
such as has not been heard in this City for
many a long day.
Between the principals and the compri
raarios there was a great gulf fixed. G.
I Napoleoni did fairly well \&s Norman,
! but poor Arthur Boyce was not up to the
I requirement of the little but important
, part of Buckland, the bridegroom.
In spite of this, however, the sextet was
â  received with demonstrations of delight.
' The chorus was not enough a grand
! chorus to keep pace with the principals,
but although a little light it did good, <
I crisp work. Altogether the performance
was a most remarkable one to be given at
regular Tivoli rates. To-night "Lucia" \
will be repeated.
The Grand Opera-House.
Deep, dark villainy and its crushing defeat
give the keynote to "A Money Order." Jule i
! Walters' new play, which filled the opera- !
j house last night. Walters, as the hero, gives a i
i strange and rather confusing view ot a charac- j
i ter in which the tramp and the gentleman '
I appear to dispute for the mastery with the j
1 odds In favor of the latter. lie is persecuted,
i spied upon, calumniated; and in general
i
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
abused after a Tearful fashion, but in the end
wealth, fame and fortune shower their gifts
upon him.
Miss Leigh, for the first time during her en
gagement, tnkes the part of a thorough-going
teminlne villain, and as Blanche Knnball, the
ndventurtiss, scored a great hit lost night.
This delectable character, it seems, is the
proud possessor of several husbands, whom
she manages to tangle up in a dreadful way.
Her schemes at last come to grief, but they
take a long time doing so, and when the final
expose takes place the husband? form them
selves into a society tor mutual admiration
and condolence, which, perhaps, is very pa
tbeUc, but seems just a little funny.
Leslie Morosco, Eugene Moore, Daisy Gro
can, Josephine Uassmanu anci Messrs. Hatch
and Butler do their share in rendering the
play of absorbing interest, but there Is a man
in the cast whose voice has an uncanny
squeak. The scenic effects arc most artistic, a
midnight view of the madhouse in which the
gentleman train is confined giving oppor-
U1 ""y fÂ»r some line transparency work.
This afternoon an extra holiday matinee per
formauce will be given.
"American** Abroad." â¢
"Americans Abroad" is a strong dramatic
presentation of Sardou's play, adapted by
Abby Sage Kichaidson for the American and
English stage, and is bidding fair to call good
audiences at the California. For one good
point there is a plot to the play, which is more
than can be said for some productions that
have grieved the public, even on the Califor
nia's boards. And then the acting is really
good, which is not always the case.
The story deals with the adventures of a
wealthy American and his daughter and a yet
wealthier ward. In Europe the trio find them
selves besieged by adventurers of all sorts and
of both sexes, all thirsting for the American
millions. This state of things ho disgusts the
rich ward that she prevails upon her uncle
and cousin to join her in feigning a sudden
reduction to poverty in order to rind out who
their real friends are. The plan works ad
mirably, though its windings are many, and,
us she ought, the heiress gets a man who loves
her lor herself and knows naught of her riches.
Mrs. Vandenhorlaiid Mi. tttockwell do tho
best work. The first named as the Baroness
de Beaumont, whom the Knglish butler per
sists in addressing as "Madame de la Bar
oness," gives a finished picture of the polished
female schemer and society speculator. Her
1 keen scent for money and her final discom
fitnre are portrayed In the most artistic man
nerâso much so that one cordially hates her
from the very first.
Mr. Etockwell as the rich American. Rtchard
Fairbanks, has a chance to do gome very pretty
worK, his takin&-do\vn of the artful baroness
being- a veritable triumph of fine actingâ but
everybody knows Stockwellcan act; the won
der would be if he did not come to time. ,
Miss Oliver us the ward and Miss Eflie Shan
non as Fairbanks' daughter are both deserving
of mention, particularly Miss Shannon, while
among the men Mr. Kelcey as Landolphe
seems to snare the honors with Mr. Stockwell.
The other characters are for the most part
passaDly sustained, and the staging is excel
lent.
The Columbia.
The Frawley Company at the Columbia last
night sent away a satisfied house. As a com
j.uny, in "London Assurance' 1 they did all that
the late lamented Dion Boucicault could have
desired.
There was but one break, and the young lady
making it no doubt will be the greatest suf
ferer. Miss Maxine Elliott as Lady Gay
Spanker, believing her husband, Dolly
P^auker, nad been shot to death, rushed out
ot the room uud tripped and felL She turned
! in time, however, to save being disfigured, and
! in a sealed position instead of standing she
j gnoke her lines and never told how she was
suffering. It was heroic.
Miss Elliott, it may be mentioned, was a per
fect equestrienne, her black or rather dark
blue habit umklng the hit of the evening's cos
tume!), but the certainly appeared to disadvun
j taee in the lighter ones.
j The rnle of Charles Courtley was to be played
by T. D. Frawlpy, but he was called to "the
I Eust, and Charles Wyngate assumed the role â 
J at forty-eight hours' notice. Mr. Frawley was
not missed, as Mr. Wyngate was most accept- |
able. The other characters were all good.
At the Orpheum.
As usual, the Orpheum was crowded last
evening. The prograrr.me gone through last
week was repeated with the addition of as
clever and refinea a turn as one would care to
see and hear. It is the Collins and Collins
couple in a warbllne, dancing and eccentric
duo. The Jackley Roston Troupe, the head of
which did some marvelous "monkey" rope
climbing, was the other new attraction.
The Casino.
The novelty of a performance every after
noon and evening of the week Is drawing well
| at the Casino, in the Haight-street grounds.
Yesterday afternoon and evening there were
large audiences to listen to the wonderful
voice of Black Patti in selections and the mu
sic of the Russian orchestra: to see the won
derful performance of the Aragon family in
their trapeze work, and see the extraordinary
performance oi Professor Macart's monkey
and <log comedians. There will be fine per
formances to-<lay on account of tht 31oat cele
bration.
Mrtnliiiioiigh Theater.
Announcement Is made that Messrs. Fried
lander, Gottlob <fc Co. will inaugurate their
management of the Mecdonough Theater this
evening with an elaborate presentation of
"Christopher Junior," to be followed on the
two succeeding nights by "The Squire of
Dames." Mr. Drew and his company antici
pate a great success in Oakland, and the inte
rior of the theater has been redecorated
throughout for the event.
A RECKLESS CELEBRATOR
A. Anderson, for Firing Bullets Out of
a Revolver, Gets Six Months
in Jail.
A. Anderson, a young man without any
occupation, amused himself on the Fourth
by faring bullets out of a revolver at
Kearny and Pacific streets. He was ar
re-ted by Policeman Moran and charged
with disturbing the peace and vagrancy.
He appeared before Judge Campbell yes
terday morning, and was convicted. The
Judge, in sentencing him to six months in
the County Jail for disturbing the peace
and for vagrancy, sahi he did not object to
any one tiring blank cartridges out of a
pistol, but he regretted that he could not
i;i'!ici a heavier sentence upon a man who
would endangerthe lives of people by reck
lessly firing leaden bullets.

HIS BRUTAL ASSULT.
Mysterious Billy Smith Knocks
Gallagher Out by Foul
Means.
The Oakland Pugilist Was in Young
Mitchell's Saloon When Sui
denly Attacked.
Billy Smith, "the Mysterious," and
Billy Gallagher, the slugger, are at
swords-point. Last Sunday afternoon
some trouble-maker quietly intimated to
"The Mysterious" that Slugger Billy was
looking for his scalp and would fight on
sight. Smith waxed angry and responded
quickly tliat he would put Gallagher to
sleep the moment he had a chance to land
his big bunch of fives on the slugger's jaw.
Gallagher was also approached by some
practical joker, who informed him that
Smith was on the warpath and would
punch his face until it resembled mince
meat.
Callcgher was wild and excited and did
I not hesitate to say that Smith wa3 the
next man he would put to sleep.
The result of the scheme to get the two
"firecrackers" exploded bore fruit. Gal
lagher loaded up with beer and started off
!on the warpath in quest of Smith. "The
Mysterious donned warpaint and went
! forth with one object in view, and that
j was to meet his enemy and lick him at
j any cost.
Early Monday morninp the sluc^er and
\ "the Mysterious" met h. Younc Mitchell's
â¢ saloon. The proprietor had already taken
his departure for home, and when the two
scrappers met there were only one or two
people in the sporting resort.
Gallagher, who was lirst on deck, was
chatting to a friend when Hmith put in an
appearance. The Oakland BJugeei was
: unaware of Smith's presence until he re
ceived a smash in the neck which was
quickly followed by a swinging right on
j the jaw. Gallagher fell a completely
i knocked-out man, and while in a pros
: trate and comatose condition Smith
â  started in to kick Gallagher's brains out
jby brisk foot work. The spectators inter
i rupted the proceedings by compelling
Smith to stand aside "until Gallagher re
covered his equilibrium.
The moment Oakland Billy regained his
pins Smith jumped at him like a bulldog
and immediately essayed to chew off a
piece of his opponents'ear and Gallagher,
endeavoring to release the hold that Smith
had taken of his ear, sunk the linger nails
of his left hand into Smith's nose. Once
again the sloggers were separated and
thrown forcibly from the saloon to tne
sidewalk. GallaKi'er was the least excited
of the two and challenged Smith to ride j
with hiii in a hack to the Cliff, where they
could settle their dilliculties under any
conditions that would be favorable to "the
Mysterious." The latter refused to go and
when the prospects for an outdoor settle
ment looked glum Gallagher's friends es
corted him to a resort, where his bloody
ear was treated by a physician.
The Oakland welter-weight champion
will not rest satisfied until he has an op
portunity to prove to Smith that he
(Smith) ia i not the only man living who
can do a little rouph-and-tumbie fighting.
GENERAL WARFIELD WINS.
An Important Opinion Relating to the
State Troops Commander.
It is rumored in military circles that
Attorney-General Fitzgerald has rendered
a decision favorable to Brigadier-General
Wartield and against Brigadier-General
Muller. After the death of Major-General
Dimond, General Muller assumed com
mand of the State troops, claiming it as
bis right under his commission dated Oc
tober, 1895. General Wartield, supported
by the local troops, disputed the other's
claim, and it was deckled to submit the
matter to the Attorney-General.
The latter'? opinion has been forwarded
to Adjutant-General Barrett, but as he is
out of the State, the exact nature and text
of the decision is not learned, but rumor
has it that it is favorable to General War
field's claims.

LILLIAN ASHLEY
RESTS HER CASE.
The Suit Against "Lucky"
Baldwin Ended Last
Night.
A CLOUD OF DETECTIVES
Wealth of the Defendant in
Ranches, Mines, Houses
and Horses.
ONE LONE MORTGAGED FAEM.
Day Set for Argument and Decision.
Crittenden's Vain Appeal
for Unruh.
The last day of the Ashley-Baldwin case
closed yesterday evening and Judge Slack
set the time for argument August 20. At
the opening of the morning session Henry
Unruh paid his $100 fine for his share of
the pistol episode of last Thursday, but
Attorney Crittenden again gave notice
that he would appeal his part of the affair
to the Supreme Court. Mr. Crittenden,
however, made a generous appeal for the
remission of Unruh's fine, stating that he
â¢was satisfied that there was no intention
on the part of that gentleman to use the
â¢weapon which he had just wrested from
Emma Ashley.
Judge Slack replied that he saw no rea
son to change his ruling, notwithstanding
the lawyer's generous request. He blamed
the attorney for carrying a loaded revolver
into court, not for attempting to draw it,
as Unruh was certainly standing and
nourishing the woman's pistol in a threat
ening manner.
Attorney R. H. Lioyd stated in turn
that when Crittenden saw Un-ruh with the
weapon in his hand he started to draw his
own weapon, saying. "I am attacked!'
but immediately dropped the weapon back
in his pocket when told that he was mis
taken.
Judge Slack granted Crittenden an ex
tension of time till next Wednesday in
which to take out a writ of habeas corpus
and secure bondsmen, pending his appeal
from the order of the court.
Then Lillian Ashley was recalled to the i
Ptand. The plaintiff of the celebrated be- j
trayal case looked worn and weary, and
v â !<â¢ Buffeting from a severe cough. The
distressing events of thÂ« last few days I
have told upon her notwithstanding her
heroic efforts to tight on to the last-
She was again confronted with the pho
tograph upon which she was beine exam
ined when her sister Emma interrupted I
'lie questioning with her revolver last
1 hursday morning. Miss Lillian did not
recognize the picture as of herself and did >
Jiot believe that it was her own.
"Miss Ashley," asked Highton, "is j
t-iere any one on earth whom this picture
represents, and can you recall anybody
v.Mom this picture resembles?"
The question was stricken out as being
improper, the witness not being sufficiently
acquainted with the earth's teeming mil
lions to give expert testimony on the sub
ject.
At the request of Crittenden both
Highton and Uoyd were subjected to the
witness-stand and were asked if they had
permitted the plaintiff's counsel access to
all papers and photographs bearing on the
case. They answered in the affirmative.
In the afternoon E. J. Baldwin was I
j placed on the stand and asked regarding i
the extent of his wealth. The defendant
! displayed a wealth of ignorance on the
I subject that was discouraging to the ques
tioner.
"How much wine have you at Santa j
Anita?' asked Crittenden.
â¢'I don't know," was the answer of the
alleged father of "Baby Beatrice."
"How many acres of oranges?"
"I don't know."
"How many acres are there in the Santa
J Anita ranch?"
"I don't know."
"How many acres have you sold from
â¢ it?"
"I don't Know."
"What is that land worth?"
"I don't know whether it is worth, any- ;
thing or not."
"What is your land worth at the least ;
figures?"
"About $80 per acre."
"Have you not asked $350 per acre for I
some of it?"
"No, sir."
Tiie witness stated that he owned 8000
acres of ttie Santa Anita ranch, 700 of the
San Franc lsquita ranch, 3500 in Poirero ;
Grande, 17,000 in the Puenta, a lot in Los j
Angeles with several buildings on it, j
! about 2500 acreÂ« in San Bernardino j
County, about 2000 acres in Monterey i
; County with a summer resort hotel on it,
several rich mines, the BalJwin Hotel and j
other property in San Francisco, and ice, i
gas and water stock.
"Have you any racehorses, Mr. Bald
win? "
"Yes."
"How many in California?"
"1 don't know."
"How many East?"
"About twenty-eight, if some of them
: are not sold."
"What is their value?"
"Don't know."
"About $lu, oo0 apiece?"
"No; neither you nor anybody else can
â¢ put a value on them."
"Have you any other property?"
"1 have some land in Indianaâ about 160
acresâ but it's mortgaged for all it's i
worth."
And the unfortunate mortgagee bowed
himself under the burden of his poverty.
N. C. Carter in rebuttal swore that E. '
J. Baldwin had ridden horseback but once
in ten years and consequently could not
have passed his time galloping over the '
green slopes of Santa Anita with the
equestrienne Lillian. Neither did the de
fendant with the plaintiff ever inhabit the i
"cottage," Mr. Carter was quite gure.
A. E. Lucas, one of the millionaire's
corps of local detectives, with a piratical !
whisker, told from the stand how A. H. i
Anderson, one of the plaintiff's witnesses, I
had sworn to "get even" with Lucky Bald- i
win.
L,uca.Â«, under instructions from Unruh j
and Baldwin, had sent another detective i
down to Pasadena to entrap Lillian Ash-
Jey into damaging disclosures.
Mrs. Mamie Belle Kelly, in rebuttal,
swore that she also heard Anderson say j
he would '-get even" with Baldwin. She!
had parted in anger from Anderson, and
she didn't like him now. She formerly i i
lived with him as his adopted niece, and j
he supported her, she said. She came and ; '
testified at the request of Lucas, and was : '
also a detective.
Emmanuel Barns was another detective
in the pay of the defendant, and told of
His services. But t:;e chief detective of all
was Mr. Wood of Boston, who reluctantly j
admitted on the stand that his iormer ! \
testimony regarding two lady visitors to i
Slifl i.ilioe was not quite correct.
"What do you get for your services, Mr.
WoOl?" a*fced Crittenden. 1

"Do you expect to get paid extra if you

"Most certainly, sir."
E. J. Baldwin was placed on the stand
in sur-rebultal and stated that he never
rode horseback around iho Santa Anita.
Oiice he rode a mule, but it was not in
company with the fair Lillian. He never
made love in a cottage with herâ in his
own or in any other cottage. He never
told Anderson that she accused him of
being the cause of her trouble and that she
had good grounds for the complaint. An
dersen never told him that he had been in
so many of these scrapes that he should
have better sense and ought to carry a re
ceipt book and be business like.
"Mr. Baldwin, what ctmrch do you be
long to?" asked Crittenden.
Question objected to by Highton.
"Wnat church do you attend, Mr
Baldwin?'
Question objected to by Lloyd.
"What is your religious belief, Mr. Bald
win?"
Question objected to by both Lloyd and ;
Highton.
"Mr. Baldwin, do you respect the sanc
tity of an oath?"
That question was not allowed and the
trial came to an end.
The plaintiff's counsel desired a continu
ance for the purpose of procuring some j
medical expert testimony, and the defense
Wanted several depositions from the East.
Judge Slack, however, stilted that ample
time had been given both sides and no
more delay would be granted.
After some discussion it was decided to

WILL INVESTIGATE.
The Federation of Women Consider*
Several Cages of Distress.
At the meeting of the Federation of
Women yesterday afternoon Miss Eva F.
Bates, the president, stated the case of
Mrs. Lang ol 917 Lombard street, who,
she said, appeared to her to be a clean
respectable woman, without the taste for
strong drink with which she has been ac
credited. Miss Bates denied that the
woman's home was bare of furniture, as
was stated in a morning paper.
"Frank Kane took Mrs. Lang's children
away as she was preparing supper one
evening. The case comes ui> on Wednes
day. Shall we take action ?' '
Several of the ladies present expressed
disapproval at the idea of it being possible
to enter a home and take children in an
arbitrary way from a parent.
Il was resolved to attend the trial and
collect testimony from the woman's neigh
bors as to her fitness to care for her chil
dren. Mrs. J. M. Woodman, a Vermont
lady, begged the members of the feder
ation to interest themselves in the Asulev
sisters. She said that during the famous
trial they had been living in a tiny room
on insufficient food with a sick child on
their hands, and that not a particle of
meat hail crossed their doors fur days.
Both Lillian and Emma she declared to be
simple eirls, not overburdened witli
braius, and she said that misery and pri
vation had had much to do with Lillian's
rash act. The case of the sisters was re
lerred to the relief committee with in
structions to visit them.

FURNITURE THROWN
INTO THE STREET
Highhanded Proceeding of
Auctioneer John W.
Flinn.
HE WILL NOW BE SUED
The House Where Millionaire
Bell Died Denuded of
Its Chattels.
BURGLARY MAY BE CHARGED
Mrs. Â£ P. Ferry, the Lard ady, and
One of the Lodgers Obtain
Search Warrants.
The house 1107 J3ush street, made famous
j from the fact that Millionaire Thomas
Bell, while living there, fell downstairs
and was fatally injured, and that his son
Fred nearly mot with a similar fate from
the tame cause there, has again come into
prominence.
The house was occupied aa a lodging
house by Mrs. Evelyn P. Ferry. Since
the accident to ycung Bell all the lodgers
had left with the exception of Bell and
Theodore Ky tka, a newspaper artist.
Thursday afternoon John \V. Flinn,
auctioneer, 321 Sutter street, accompanied
by about a dozen men, went to the house
and threw all the furniture and other
effects in the sixteen rooms into the street
and carted the goods off on wagons to
Flinn's auction rooms. Among the effects
taken away was about $.500 worth of pho
tographic and engraving apparatus and
furniture belonging to Kytka, a portion
of wnich was returned that night.
Yesterday alternoon Kytka and Mrs.
Ferry obtained search warrants in Judge
Campbell*! court, and Captain Wittman
placed an ofticer in charge of the furniture
and effects in Flinn's rooms till they can
be removed to-day.
In speaking of Flinn's action Mrs.
Ferry said: "The furniture in the house
was worth $6000. I borrowed $1000 on it
from one Jacobson several months ago.
ThÂ«; mortgage had four months yet to
run. I have been paying the interest reg
ularly every month, but last month I was
a day or two behind time.
"Flinn came to the house on Thursday j
afternoon. He said that Jacobson had j
transferred the mortgage to him and he i
wanted to know if 1 was ready to pay it '
off. I told him it had some months to !
run, but 1 would pay the interest. He
sui-.i : â  the interest, 1 want the princi
pal,' and then he lifted up the window
and called out to a man, 'Come here, dep
uty, uint seize the furniture.' With that
he lifted up a valuable chair and threw it
out of the window into the btreet.
"Then a man opened the front door I
with a skeleton key and he and several
other men came in. They threw the fur
niture and otner effects into the street,

"Yes,'' said Kytka, "they also threw

DR. KUHLMAN IS SAFE.
He Will Not at Present Have to Go to
J:ill for Contempt.
Dr. Kuhlman will not have to go to jail,
at least not at present, for his action in re
fusing to be sworn by Coroner Hawkins
in the Sonderup inquest.
On Friday last the Supremo Court de
cided that the Coroner had the right to
commit Kuhlman for contempt and re
manded him to the custody of the Sheriff.
That ofh'cial, however, did not immure the
physician in the County Jail, but awaited
further action by Judge Wallace.
The case was called in Department 6
yesterday and Judge Wallace refused to
take any further action in the matter.
He said that the Supreme Court had
decided the case and he ha 3 nothing
further to do with it.
The contempt commitment was for ten
days and dated June 20, so that time has
expired. Consequently, Dr. Kuhlman
will not be troubled further until Coroner
Hawkins returns from his vacation in the
Yosemite. Then the inquest will again
be called, and if Kuhlman refuses to be
sworn or to testify after being sworn he
will De sent to jail until he consents to do
80.
THE STRIPED BASS.
Angler* Can Catch lliem With Hook
ami Line Near San Pablo.
Anglers who have yearned for an op
j portunlty to catch striped bass with hook
and line can now look forward to some
good sport. On Sunday two fishermen,
John Wilson and Edward Mogan, were
: bait-fishing in San Pablo slough for cat
fish when Wilson hooked a bass which he
j indeed was rive or six pounds in weight.
j Not being properly rigged for game fishes.
! Mr. Bass made short work of his tackle. ]
i He then attached larger nooks to his line j
j and succeeded in hooking and landing a j
three-pound bass. The angler states that I
I he nad seen several bass jumping and I
I they appeared to be chasing some small j
fishes which -are: quite- plentiful in the
slough. Wilson tninks that with the !
proper paraphernalia good sport can be
| had near the mouth of the slough where
the water is deep.

Statement.
DEAN TELLS OF A " FALL FUND."
When He Himself Fell, However,
Creegan, as Custodian, Failed
to Pony Out.
Considerable damaging testimony was
introduced against Becker and Creegan,
on trial for forgery, in Judge Wallace's
court yesterday. No absolutely positive
Four of the Men Who Are Working to Secure the Conviction of Forgers Creegan
and Becker.
evidence had been hitherto introduced
that Becker was engaged in the Nevada
Bank affair. True, there was considerable
hearsay testimony that he raised the
Woodland draft, but no one had sworn
that he had seen "the Dutchman" in the
State, but yesterday Joe McClosker, or Mc-
Closkey, testified that he had seen and
recognized Becker on Broadway, Oakland,
in December, 1895.
McClosker denied the imputations that
the attorney for the defense has frequently
made that he was the man who went-into
the Nevada Bank with Seaver or Dean.
McClosker declared yesterday* that he
stood in front of the Kuss House while
Seaver went into tho bank.
Detective H.imrn of Philadelphia also
gave some strong evidence against the de
fendants. He had arrested them in Phila
delphia and had found upon them a num
ber of new $20 pieces of the San Francisco
mint similar to those taken from the bank
by Seaver. Inasmuch as very little gold
is in circulation in Philadelphia this cir
cumstance was rather suspirious.
Joseph McClosker, or McCloskey, was
first sworn. He testified that he was a
native of New York, 52 years of age, and
had lived in various parts of America and
Europe. He had arrived in this City on
the night of November 20, 1895, having
come to California partly on account of
his health and partly on some 'little busi
ness" which Creeean had proposed, but
the details of which McCosker knew
nothing about.
He had just met Creegan in this City on
December 1,1806, and met him on various !
occasions afterward up to the 16th of the
month. He had seen Becker in Oakland
walking alone on Broadway. McClosker I
here, in reply to a question from Attorney
Wilson, admitted mat he had been con- i
victed before of a felony and larceny, but '
never of forgery, and that he had'spent '
eight yea's and nine months in the Mary
land penitentiary, being discharged in
July, 1895.
On December 10 or 11 he had met Gree- \
pan on the Oakland boat, but Creegan had i
told him to ".Split off; there's a man on
the boat knows me. 1 ' The two then made
an appointment to meet on the same even
ing or the following evening. When they
met McCiosker met Seaver. whom Creegan
had referred to on the boat, and after that i
McClosker ni^t Seaver continuously almost i
everyday. On the morning of the 17ih j
Seaver told oCcClosker thai he had received :
a draft which Becker had raised from $12
to $22,000. At this time, however. Me-
ClosJcer was not familiar with the plans of
Creegan and Seaver.
O.i thir 18th McCJoskermet Seaver at the
Zinkand and ajgreed to meet him next |
â¢morning at Third and Mission. According
to this agreement they met and at Sf-aver's
request McClosker agreed to follow him
during the day. He followed him toward
the Nevada Bank, but did not enter the
bank. He stopped in front of the Russ
House, and after Seaver (!anie out with the
money and drove away McClosker went py
agreement to 212 Eddy, where Seaver put |
the money into four woolen socks. Then
Seaver gave McClosker two of the socks
and the latter started out. As be reached
the street Creegan, who was standing op
posite, came up and tooK one of the pack
ages of money.
In the afternoon Creegan and McClosker
went over to Oakland to take the package
ol $.">00lÂ» to Becker. They got off at Stventh
street and Creegan ieft Mculosker and
took the money. Meanwhile McClosker
stopped at a stand to get his shoes blacked,
and while he was still on the stand Cree
gan came back and gave him a package to
take to New York, because Creegan said it
would bo dangerous for him to keep it.
Later McClosker had examined the pack
age and found a miscellaneous assortment
of acid, inks, pens, brushes, drafts and
tracing paper,
McClosker had left the satchel at the
bootblack-stand, but after he and Creegan
had left the latter suggested that he go
back and get the satchel and throw it
overboard or get it out of the way. Mc-
Closker went baclc and got it, but left it at
a drugstore on Seventh street. When he
again met Creegan the latter gave him
$100. which ' c said "The Dutchman" had
sent him. With an agreement to meet in
Omaha or New York, McClosker and Cree
gan finally parted.
McCioskerJreturned to this City and saw
Seaver at the Lexington. McClosker told j
Seaver tbat'he had had a hard day's work, i
that he was glad the business was over I
and that he was going home to New York
that evening. Seaver asked him to get
him a ticket also and McCiosker did so.
Before leaving the City Seaver gave him
what he regarded as a present of $500.
McClosker went EaÂ«t that night, taking
with him Seaver's baggage, to be delivered
at the iatter's residence in New York.
According to his previous agreement
with Creegan, McClosker put the follow
ing personal advertisement in the New
York Herald: "Jim: Meet me every
night at S. at Bp. m. Joe." And a few
days later: "Jim: Every night for a
week at the S., Bp. m. to 8:15. Joe."
The two met as a Result of these adver
tisements, and McClosker returned to
Creegan the package which had been
given him in Oakland. Creegan and Me- '
Closker had then gone to Philadelphia 1
and returned soon to New York, where
these two and Seaver met. Ttie three had
tnen gone to Minnesota and were arrested
in Minneapolis. McClosker did not know j
of his own knowledge that Becker was
present in Minneapolis, but he had seen I
him in the East in New Jersey, where he
was in jail with Creegan.
After further communication with
Creegan through the personal column of
the New York Herald, McClosker re
ceived several letters from Mm arranging
for a meeting at Hoboken. McClosker
had various conversations with Creegan
and endeavored to'get from him $3000 with
which to defend Seaver, but he failed to
get the money, McClosker declared that
he had appealed for the money, not de
manded it.
This appeal for money had been based
upon an agreement between Creegan, Sea
ver and Becker in regard to a $0000 '"fall
fund," which was to be raised to defend
any one of the party who slsould fall into
the hands of the law.
When Attorney Wilson's long examina
tion was finished Attorney Dunne took the
witness in hand. He testified that he had
made certain statements to Captain Lees, i
but did not know that the statements had j
been taken down in writing. Attorney
Dunne asked Attorneys Black and Wilson
if they had any memoranda of McClos
ker's statements, but they denied that
they had any such in their possession.
Captain .Lees was then sworn and asked j
if he knew of any such memoranda of Mo
Closker's statement.
"I do," replied Captain Lees.
"Have you those memoranda in your
possession?" continued Attorney Dunne.
"I have," answered the captain.
"Will you produce them ?''
"No," was the curt response of the de
tective.
After hearing considerable argument in
regard to com celling Cactain Lees to pro
duce his memoranda, Judge Wallace re
fused to compel the captain to bring them
into court.
Attorney Dunne resumed the examina
tion of McClo-.ker and went into the wit
ness' past record. He admitted that he '
had spent about twelve years of his life in i
prispn. He had come out here to be a !
â witness in company with Mrs. Seaver and i
his expenses were being paid by Detective
Lee 3.
The witness denied that on the morning j
of the 18th of December he had gone to !
Dean's office, in the Chronicle building, i
and ne also reiterated h s former denial of '
having gone into the Nevada Bank with |
Seaver. At this juncture the court ad
journed until 2 o'clock.
The cross-examination of Witness Mc-
Closker was resumed at the opening of the |
afterno n session. He testified to numer
ous meetings during the early part of De
cember with Creegan and Seaver. The
first he knew of the Nevada Bank trinsac
tion was on December 16. In regard to
purchasing the tickets east McClosker tes
tified yesterday tliat Seaver had told him
at his room on Eddy street to purchase the
ticket. According to a statement to De
tective Whittaker, which McClosker was
not prepared yesterday to deny, Dean was
in front of the Zinkand when he requested !
him to purchase tne ticket.
In tie redirect examination McClosker
explained why he had taken the al.asJ.
M. Shaw in Minneapolis. He had d one so
in order to open up Â« bank account in
preparation for a iittle piece of business in
which he was engaged with Creegan.
McClosker denied having made any
wiitten statement of the Nevada Bank i
case to anybody in this State, but said '
that he had made a statement to Robert
Hnkerton.
I:i answer to a question from a juryman,
McClosker testified that when he had seen
Becker in Oakland he was fully aware of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 7, 1896.
bis identity. With this the witness was
allowed to depart.
James P. Hamm, a Philadelphia detect
ive, took the stand. He had seen Becker
and Cre-'gan in Philadelphia in April of
this year, and had placed them under ar
rest on April 18, after watching and fol
lowing them for some time. He bad
charge of Creegan and Detective Eckstein
had taken -Becker. On the way to the
station Creegan had offered Hamm $100 if
he would let Dim go. At the time of their
arrest Creegan admitted bis true name,
but Becker at first gave a false name, and
finally gave his true name aftÂ»*r the Chief
had recounted some of his former deeds.
Hamm ha I searched tne two prisoners.
Upon Creegan he had found five new $20
-pieces of 1895, stamped with the "S" of
the San Francisco Mint, and upon Becker
ne found thirteen similar double eagles.
Upon visiting the Hanover Hotel, where
Becker and Creegan were staying under
assumed names, Detective Hamm had
found two steamship tickets to Guatemnla
via Panama, upon which were the names
J. W. Hillen and C. M. Bader. The de
tective had also found a pacKage, which
was opened at the police headquarters.
The contents of this package were the
same as those of the package given by
Creegan to McCiosker in Oakland. Upon
his examination at Philadelphia Becker
had explained his possession of the
forger's outfit by saying that he was on
his way to Central America to open a
gambling-house and that he intended to
use the inks and acids on playing-cards.
He admitted to the magistrate that while
"he engraved a little, painting was his
trade."
Creegan told the Judge that be had been
in California "playing the races," but
Becker declared that he had been in New
York all winter. At the conclusion of
their examination before the magistrate
Creegan and Becker were told to get out
of town within an hour, and they did so.
Before they left, however, the two men
and Detectives Hamm and Eckstein drank
wine for twenty or twenty-five minutes
before the train left.
Seaver was recalled to explain the "fall
fund," referred to by McCosker. There
| had been an understanding between Cree
gan, Seaver and Becker some two years
ago in London. Seaver had then contrib
uted $5000 to the fall fund, which aggre
gated the sum of $15,000. So far as Seaver
I knew this fund was and still is in the cus-
I tody of Creegan.
The available supply of witnesses being
i exhausted, Judge Wallace adjourned court,
\ with the usual admonition to the jury,
i until Wednerday morning at 10 o'clock.
TO TAX ITS FRANCHISE,
Siebe Wants to Collect From
the Mutual Electric Light
Company.
The Corporation Will Take the
Matter Before the Board of
Equalization.
The Mutual Electric Light Company
has petitioned the Superior Court to re
strain Assessor Siebe from collecting $1125
taxes which he has levied on that corpo
ration on a $50,000 valuation of its fran
chise.
The light company claims that it has
i paid personal property tax on $18,445,
! which it says is the full value of its per
! sonal holdings. The company claims
I that it is a young; corporation and that its
business is not sufficiently profitable to
make its franchise worth anything like
the figure at which Mr. Siebe has valued it.
Tne object of the restraining order is to
get the matter before the Board of Equal
ization.
Another phuse of the matter is the con
tention that the Mutual Light Company
has no franchise, although how that claim
will hold is not obvious, as it paid taxes
on a $5000 valuation of its franchise last
year.
It is also claimed that the Board of
Equalization has not proceeded in the
matter of equalization of the assessment
roll of 1896, and, therefore, that the at
tempt of Assessor Sieb- to collect taxes for
1896 is in violation of the State constitu
tion.
Judge Troutt issued the restraining
order.

THE NIGHT
OWL'S TIPPLE,
Supervisors Planning to
Cut It Short at Mid
night.
TAYLOR WANTS IT DONE
Wagner Makes a Strong Fight
for an Indefinite Post
ponement.
SERGEANT-AT-ARMS CHANGED.
Owners of Castroville Lakes Water
File a Supplementary Offer With
the Board.
The question as to whether saloons in
San Francisco shall be closed between 12
midnight and 6 o'clock in the morning
nearly precipitated a row in the meeting
of the Board of Supervisors yesterday. At
tnp last meeting of the board an ordinance
to that effect was passed to print and
came up for its second reading yesterday.
Supervisor Wagner, who, by the way, is
in the retail liquor business, opposed it
vigorously and moved that the matter be
indefinitely postponed.
He said that the order was aimed at the
dives, which every one understood to be
an evil, but that the effect would be more
far-reaching than had been at first in
tended.
He declared that places like the Orpheum
and kindred resorts, which he said were
supported by the most respectable people
in San Francisco, would be closed by the
order.
Supervisor Taylor demanded to know
why there was such an inclination on the
part of certain members to put the mat
ter off indefinitely. He said he looked
upon the order as a gooÂ«l one which would
redound to the credit and benefit of San
Francisco.
Supervisor Wagner stuck to his state
ment that the order would injure those
for whom it was never intended, and said
that if the present 1 rdinance closing sa
loons at 1 o'clock a. m. was enforced the
law would be strict enough to suit all.
Supervisor Taylor averted further dis
cussion by moving that the matter be re
ferred back to the Health and Police Com
mittee.
E. S. Field, a Supervisor of Los Angeles
County, sent a communication requesting
the board to to-operate with the southern
authorities in getting a bill passed
through the next Legislature providing
for an appropriation for the support of
aged persons and indicants. This was re
ferred to the Judiciary Committee.
Supervisor Hobbs introduced a resolu
tion that was carried declaring vacant the
position of sergeant-at-arms of the board,
eld by William Donald, and appointing
Robert B. Bartlett, a former employe of
the municipality in the same capacity, to
the place.
The same Supervisor introduced a reso
lution instructing the inspector of gas
lamps to furnish the board with a list of
places in public streets and. buildings
where lamps are contiguous to each other
and where one or more can be cut off with
out loss to the efficiency of the service.
The owners of the water supDly of the
Castroville lakes sent in an offer supple
mentary to the one made some time ago,
in which they offered to sell their prop
erty lor $14,000,000. They also sent in re
ports from William Irelan ana C. A. Og
den commending the waters of the lakes
both as to quantity and quality.

nittee â composed of Colonel John
O'Bvrne, Dr. F. W. D'Evelyn and R. P.
Doolanâ being unable to determine which
one to choose, postponed action until the
next meeting.
There was one, however, that, judging
from a remark made by Colonel O'Byrne,
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
| was evidently the choice of the commit
| tee.
"Look at all these pictures," said the
colonel to a newspaper man who was pres
ent at the close of the meeting, "and tell
I us which you prefer."
After an examination of the many draw
ings fastened to the wall the referee de
clared in favor of a star-shaped one em
blematic of the coming event.
"Bravo," exclaimed the colonel; "the
judgment of a Daniel."
"Is that the one your committee has
favorably considered;''
"Young man," replied the colonel. "I
told you the committee has not decided
upon a design ; and I can only say that
; you have good taste."

ol ( alifornia and the carnival, and the
main landscape represents features of the
topography of ;he Btate. Below is a rep
i resentation of the City of San Francisco,
wreathed in California eschscholtzias. The
different angles of the star represent the
I days of the carnival, namely, florai, festivi
ties by land and water, yachting, military
parades and illuminations. The upper an
gle represents mirth, music and merri
ment. The carnival colors, red, gold and
blue, are represented by the drapery.
Other contestants for the prize are F. A.
Haber, J. Murrey, R. E. Foster, Stella Wil
tram, Alice Smith and George F. Manuel.
There were submitted a number of de
| signs for an official badge to be worn dur
ing the carnival, but no action was taken
on them. The most attractive is one sub
mitted by Frank T. Shea.
Arrangements are being made for the
mass-meeting to be held on Thursday in
the quarters of the Chamber of Commerce
at 2:30 o'clock. Hugh Craig will preside
and fifty prominent citizens have been
asked to serve as vice-presidents.
"We expect to rill ttie hall," said Gen
eral Warlield, "and feel confident tnat we
will receive much encouragement. To
j night I ieave for Monterey to take part in
} the celebration there, but will be back in
j time to attend the meeting."
' Mayor Sutro and James D. Phelan have ,
j been invited to address the meeting, and i
â  it is very likely that they will.
The following is a copy of a letter that !
will be sent to-day to a large number of j
I citizens and business men:
Bah Francisco. Crl., July 8, 1806.
To the Public-Spirited Citizens of San Fran- 'â 
Cisco: The executive committee of the Carnival i
oi the Golden Gate desires your co-operation ,
i in furthering the interests of the week of fes- j
, tivlties to be held in this City during the early ;
I part of October.
I Careful consideration has been given to the '
project by those who are instrumental in pro- j
moting it. They are men representing the in- i
dustrial, financial and commercial Interests of
Ban Francisco, and realize the advantages that â 
; will accrue from the presence of several hun- (
i dred thousand strangers In our midst during !
1 the week selected.
The Merchant.-.' Association, the Board of j
â  Trade and the Chamber of Commerce desire to '
! assist the executive committee in making the I
cnrnival a grand euccess. In order that the I
; public may become acquainted with the fea- j
â  tures that will make this week a most memor- I
; able one in the history of San Francisco, they
i R"k you to meet with them in the rooms of the j
â  Chamber of Commerce, in the Merchants' Ex- I
: change building, to-morrow (Thursday) after
; noon, July 0, 189t5, at 2:30 p. M.
The financial results attending the carnivals
held in the interior of the State, not to speak j
i of the Mardi Gras of Xew Orleans, the Veiled
Prophet demonstration in St. Louis, shows
that an affair of this kind means large finan
cial returns to every line of business. It is a I
matter in which the whole State is interested, :
i and once inaugurated will become an annual '
! feature.
Not less than if 50.000 will be expended in I
presenting the affair to the public. This
amount will Rive employment to a larjje num
ber of artisans, and be spent among our own
tradespeople. If we attract for one week an
i attendance or even 100,000 persons it means
> an increase in our revenues of not less than !
$2,500,000. (an we afford to let such an op
portvnity pass by ?
In the name of the business interests of this
City, we invite you and your friends to meet
us on Thursday afternoon. This is a matter of
jmrnmount importance, as the success of the
affair largely depends upon the hearty assist
ance of every one.
On behalf of the executive committee we ic
| main, for the good of San Francisco,
R. 11. Warfikld,
Provident Executive Committee.
Samuel V. Backus, Secretary.
On Thursday, the 14th, there will be a
sale of seals in the Columbia. Theater for
the performance to be given on the even
ing of the 10th in aid of the fund.

The eingle-taxers held an enthusiastic
meeting last evening at the Mills building,
with fair attendance. It was for the an

the progress of the work generally.
Joseph Leggett, James H. Barry, James
8. Reynolds and others reported many
successful meetings and an increased de
mand for Mnsle-tax speakers at different

ing report to make from Japan. The Ilev.

and proportionalist, who resides there,
writes that both these fundamental re
forms are making rapid progress in that
country. Members from different parts of
the City hai only good reports oi

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 7, 1S9(Â».
ALMA JOSSELYN
AND HER SVENGALI.
Dr. Arthur Marten on Trial
for Threats to
Kill.
PLEADS HIS OWN CAUSE.
A Young Girl's Pitiful Story of
Betrayal and Perse
cution.
LIVING FOR YEARS IN DURESS.
Judge Campbell Orders the Defendant
Into Custody Until To
morrow Morning.
Dr. Arthur Marten, physician and
philosopher, appeared in Judge Camp
bell's court yesterday afternoon to an
swer the charge of threats to kill. He
conducted his own defense, and Colonel
Eddy was special prosecutor.
Dr. Marten showed that he had been
carefully studying the legal aspect of the
case and skillfully handled it. He asked
for a continuance, but it was refused.
Alma Josselyn, the complaining wit
ness, was called to the stand, and Dr.
Marten at once interposed an objection on
the ground that a wife could not testify
against her husband. He quoted a deci
sion of the Supreme Court on the point
and also referred the Judge to section LBB2
of the Penal Code. The Judge overruled
bis objection, and the doctor still fought
hard to exclude the young woman's evi
dence. He said if she wanted a divorce
from him she could have it, as be would
not oppose it, and he would swear never
to molest her again. "She is my dear
wife," said he, "and the mother of my
children, and how could 1 threaten to take
her life?"
This appeal had no effect upon the Judge.
"If you loved this young girl and bad
her honor at heart," said the Judge
sternly, "why did you not marry her
legally. "Why did you not get a license
and be marriea to her by a clergyman or
other proper person ?"
"There were legal reasons," said the
doctor, "which made it necessary that we
should not let the whole world know that
we were man and wife?"
"That's bosh!" retorted the Judge.
"Proceed with the case."
Then in answer to questions the young
woman, who looked as if she were dying
from consumption, told her pitiful story,
keeping her eyes away from the defendunt
as if she were afraid of being hypnotized
by him.
She said Â«he was born in 1976 and first
met the defendant about three and a half
years ago in the hou^e of her step-grand
father, George Staacke. At that time he
became criminally intimate with her by
presenting a pistol at her bead and threat
ening to kill her unless she submitted.
She had been under duress since then and
was constantly in fear of her life.
At this point the doctor said, "Now, my
lovey, how can you say that of me?"
"That will do," shouted Colonel Eddy,
"none of your iSvengali tricks here."
The witness continued, sayinn she had
borne him two children, one IS months
old and the other about 3 months. Once
he kept her locked up in a room in his
office for nine months and would not allow
her to pee any one.
"Couldn't you have got out and gone to
your friends?" asked the Judge.
"Where was Ito go? 1 ' replied the wit
ness. "I was then without friends, and
wns completely in the power of that man."
She detailed how the defendant had
made her swear falsely to affidavits in the
case against George Staacke for $50,000
damages for betrayal, and how he had
conspired to get himself appointed legal
guardian to her younger sister, Lulu, to
use her as a witness against Staacke. He
had repeatedly threatened to kill her if
she told any one about these things. He
had threatened to kill her and her two
babies within the past week or two.
The defendant cross-examined the wit
NEW TO-DAT.
Twisted, swollen, painful, weakening in its effects upon the
vital powers, the direct cause of thousands of cases of general
nervous exhaustion, debility and decay. This is Varieoeele in
the veins of the vital parts. It is perhaps the most dangerous of
the many results of early indiscretions. It drains the vital pow-
ers in that slow, treacherous manner which leaves no sign of its
terrible effect until the awful work is done â until the whole
nerve force, the foundation of mental, physical and vital strength,
is undermined and manhood destroyed. Doctors have tried
every known means in their attempts to cure it, and have usually
given it up with the advice that it will not -be a serious matter.
But this is only their way of excusing themselves for their help-
lessness. It is a serious matter, as is proven by the thousands of
physical wrecks it has caused. But it can be cured by
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt.
SAN FRANCISCO, June 18, 1398.
TO THOSE SUFFERING FROM VARICOCELE:â
I would like to add my testimony to numerous others in possession of Dr. San-
den's Electric Belt Co. I purcnaaed a No. 7 Bait from Dr. Sanuen about the first oJ
April, which I used according to directions, and after three months' trial I am happy
to state that my varicocele, which was of twelve years' standing, has almost entirely
disappeared, and the veins and parts are almost normal. I take great pleasure in
recommending this belt to any one suffering from a like trouble.

ness at length, mainly with the object of
showine that he had introduced her as hfa
wife at the Fabiola Hospital and had been
always solicitous about her health. He
introduced letters from her to him and
vice versa showing that they were couched
in endearing terms, but the witness said
she had to write ttiat way as she was afraid
of her life to write otherwise.
During the cross-examination Colonel
Eddy remarked that a more serious crime
should have been charged against the de
fendant, but the doctor was equal to the
occasion and said it happened three and a
half years ago and was barred by the
statute of limitations.
Mrs. E. A. Ka^ford, 1322 Mission street,
where the complaining witness and her
babies are living, testilied to the defendant
making threats of spilling blood a few
days ago. She and the defendant had
several lively passaees-at-arms, but she
always came out ahead.
The defflndant denied threatening to
kill "his wife," as he persisted in calling
the complaining witness; spoke of his
love for her and their children, and said
she had been made to testify against him
by his enemies.
Colonel Eddy made a scathing attack
on the defendant, and urged that his
bonds should not be less than $10,000, to
compel him to keep the peace.
The Judge ordered the defendant into
custody, and said he would render his de
cision tomorrow morning.
DANGERS OF POKER.
A Winner Who Alleges He Had to Dis-
gorge at the Point or a
Revolver.
M. Kinney, (#5 Market street, dropped
Into the saloon of William McCauiey, cor
ner of Polk and McAllister streets, Sunday
night, and lie and McCauiey engaged in a
game of poker in a rear room, where they
were joined by a friend of McCauiey.
"We played till about midnight," said
Kinney yesterday, "and 1 cleaned Mc-
Cauiey out. Then he went to the bar
room and returned. To my surprise he
placed the muzzle of a revolver against mv
nose, took $23 that was on the table in
front of me and told me to get out. Well,
as I was unarmed I had to get."
Yesterday afternoon Kinney appeared
in Judge Campbell's court and swore to a
complaint charging McCauiey with rob
bery.
BIG ESTATE, NO RENTS,
The Daughter of the Late Dr.
Toland Sues Her
Agents.
Estate Said to Have Been Grossly
Mismanaged â Property Covered
With Mortgages.
Mrs. Mary Li Firne. through her attor
ney, Albert C. Aiken, brought suit in the
Superior Court yesterday against her
agent?, Ashton A Gardner, to s-ceure an ac
counting of the business transacted for her,
and in the meantime an injunction is
asked for restraining them from making
n:y contracts in her name.
Avhton it Gardner have a nower of at
y from Mr*. Slme and refuse to give
i it up, claiming that !-he is indebted to
1 them. They Lave had charge of her busi
ness interests for the past six years and
j she claims that they have grossly mis
â¢ managed them.
Mrs. Sime is or.c of three children of the
late I>r. H. H. Toland of the Toland Med
ical College. Ho left an estate valued at
$700,000, in which Mrs. Simo has a one
third life interest.
The property consists of a large ranch in
Solano County and property in this City
on Pine Btreet, near Kearny, on Everett
and Third and on Jackson street.
Ashton it Gardner have reported to
Mrs. Sime a constantly depreciating
' value and decreasing revenue, she say?.
j They have recently threatened to cut off
j the income entirely, and have covered the
! property with mortgages bearing high
I rates of interest. Gardner himself holds
; one mortgage at 1 per cent compounding
monthly.
It is alÂ«o charged that large sums of
1 money have been put to uses not author
! bed by Mrs. Hmo; tliat thÂ» firm refuses to
j yield up their management of the estate
although they have ireuiuiitly asked Mrs.
Si me to tr;ui*for it to some one else; that
they are employing every means to incon
venience thÂ« b'rm that Mrs. Sime has em-
I ployed, having recently served notices on
i the tenants not to pay oyer any rents to
' them. All these allegations are made in
| the complaint as filed.
Mrs. Eame is conlined to her bed by ill
ness at her home in Connecticut, and is
reported to be very much worried over the

Explanation.
To* arrow flies with tb* wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
4ays: those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rain of melted snow in inches and huiidredths,
Coring the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect points of equal air pressure; loo
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
cosvs:. When the pressure is high in the interiot
and low aioi.k,' the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable:
but when the '-lciw" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain !-ouih 01 Oregon is improb
able. With a â¢â¢high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California' coast, warmer
weather may be â .:,-,! D summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
Will produce an opposite result.

The temperature has risen in Eastern California

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
JCJtW YORK. N. V.. July 6.â The opening of
-the stock market was characterized by firmness.
London having reported a further advance in
American securities there. The early gain was
equal to Vi@l per cent; nearly every active stock 'â 
on the list participating In the upward movement.
A reduction in the posted rates of sterling ex
change of Vie, which renders gold export out of
the question unless foreign bankers are willing to
pay a heavy commission, was the most favorable
development at this time. Th-> firmness was
shortlived, however, and soon after the opening
the market broke % to 21.4 per cent under the
leadership of Chicago Oas and Sugar. The former
dropped to 56 and the latter to 10714.
sugar was depressed by the redu?tion in refined.
The crenaen were then taken in hand, and soon
lost > 40,11 3 PÂ«r cent. Manhattan, Jersey Central
and Louisville and Nashville aiso lacked support,
and scored material losses. As of late, the decline
brought in orders for European account, and
according to good authorities foreign houses bought
from 15,000 to 20.01:0 shares during the morning
session. Speculation during the afternoon was
quiet for a time, but in the last hour the traders bid
the market up all around.
They were influenced mainly by the steady buy
ing for London account, a'though the news from
Chicago late in the day was looked upon as more
encouraging. In the afternoon advance Sugar
Chicago Oas, St: Paul, Louisville am Nashville,
"eneral Blectrtc and Pacllic Mail were notably
strong. speculation left on firm with prices any
where from ' 4 Â«o â¢'â â¢h per cent higher than on Fri

TWO WEEKS' PROGRAMME
Commander Booth-Tucker Will
Be Present for the Last
Three Days.
STAFF OFFICERS TO WED.
Ready for the Greatest Reunion Ever
H- d by the Army on the
Oakland Office Francisco Call,)
V9OS Broadway, July 6. )
Great preparations are being made for
the great annual camp-meeting of the Sal
vation Army of the Pacific Coast. It will
be held at Tie-tie Gien and will last two
weeks, commencing next Sunday.
A large number of tents have already
been pitched and the campground will
cover many acres before the opening day.
The camp-meeting this year has been |
delayed two weeks beyoÂ«d the usual time I
to allow Commander Booth-Tucker to be |
present on the three concluding days and j
hold a great reunion of the department all
over the coast.
Owing to the recent trouble in the army
a special effort is being made to bring to
gether as many of the officers as possible.
One of the leading features of the camp
meeting will be a public wedding, which
will take place next Wednesday evening.
Brigadier Keppel will be the officiating
mini-ter and the names of the contracting
parties are being carefully guarded. As
the Salvation Army contains so much j
eligible material for marriage, there is :
large scope for conjecture.
The concluding event of the camp-meet- i
ing will also be a wedding, which will be :
solemnized on Sunday afternoon, July 26. I
Commander Booth-Tucker will officiate, :
and as the principals are two staff officers |
the affair will be the star feature of the
meet.
The programme is typical of the Salva
tion Army. There are four meetings each
day, at 9 and 10:30 A. m. and '2:30 and 7:30

BATTLE OF THE CLUBS,
McKinley League of Berkeley
Will Hold a Meeting
To-Night.
Captain Morrison of the Republican
Club Thinks Striker Wants
to Be a Boss.
BERKELEY, C A i.., July 6.â The Mc-
Kinley League of Berkeley will meet to
morrow nijrht in Odd Fellows' Hall.
The Republican Club, which, it is
claimed, was organized without proper
authority, is likely to receive attention at
t lie hands of the McKinley League's ruem
as the controversy between the two
ciubs threatens to become more and more
bitten
Captain J. T. Morrison, a prominent
member of the Republican Club, is in
oignautatthe aspersions cast upon that
organization by County Committeeman
J. W. Striker. Said the captain:
The Berkeley Republican Club would
like to know what is the matter with J. W.
Striker, anyway. He seems to be wasting
â  great deal of valuable breath in hurling
â .'â¢:utlicinas at the first and only Republi
i in club in Ea^t Berkeley because they
â  t ask his permission to organize and
: caose he was not aiked to boss the job.
''The respectable element in the Repub
lican party in Berkeley needs no boss, and
the sooner Mr. Striker pets that notion
out of his head the sooner that portion of
Ins anatomy will cease to swell. Kvi
â¢l-nilv he has not learned that this coun
try existed before his day and generation,
and will continue to exist when the Strik
ers cense from striking and the weary
politician is at rest.
"No. The .Berkeley Republican Club is
organized for business, and does not have
to ask Mr. Striker's permission â 'not any,'
Washington is great, but Striker is im
mense.'"

BERKELEY, Cal., July 6. â Miss E.

RAISED VALUATIONS.
Assessor Dalton Adds an Extra Million
to the Value of the
County.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 6. â Assessor
H. P. Dalton turned his assessment books
over to the County Clerk to-day according
to law. Among 'the most striking
changes from last year's roll is in the
matter of the banks. They made their
returns at the request of Mr. Dal
ton, but he was not satisfied and se
cured the services of T. E. Atkinson, an
I expert bank accountant, who examined
j the books of each bank. He was sworn in
ias a Deputy Assessor, and made the
I assessment after his examination of the
books. As a consequence the National
banks will have to pay taxes on $417,650.
more property than last year, while the
other banks ' have a little over $500,000
added to their taxable property.
Should this assessment be attacked in
the Board of Equalization Mr. Dalton will
have every officer in the bants sworn and
examined in relation to the correctness of :
the report of Mr. Atkinson.
The assessment totals by incorporated
cities and towns of the rolls are:
Alumeda 11. 321. 975

The total real estate roll is $352,525 less

The increase in the personal-property roll
more than brings up the aggregate.
HERRSCHER WINS AGAIN,
Awarded the Contract for Sup
plies at the County
lEfirmary.
The Board Meets as a Board of
Equalization and Spsedily
Adjiurns.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) \
908 Broadway, July 6. )
The Board of Supervisors met to-day ;
and awarded the contract for furnishing !
supplies to the County Infirmary. Two !
weeks ago when they attempted to award j
in a bid that gave the highest bidder the I
preference there was much opposition and i
considerable hard talk engaged in by the ,
bidders. '
The successful men to-day bid several |
thousand dollars lower than their bid at j
that time. Joseph Herrscner of San
Leandro was awarded the contract for
furnishing groceries at $5535 79)Â£. Joseph
Harris will furnish the clothing for
$347 07}Â£. The samples furnished by the |
successful bidders were kept by the super- â 
intendent to compare the goods with when
delivered.
Mr. Herrscher'a opponents assert that j
he will lose money belore the year is past j
if he furnishes goods equal to his samples, j
which all unite in pronouncing first class. |
The Supervisors promise that nothing j
sliort of the samples shall be accepted by i
the superintendent.
The board adjourned and met as the
Board of Equalization. After receiving a j
notification from the County Clerk that i
he had received hfty-four volumes of per
sonal property assessments and one of
personal property they passed the necesÂ«
sary notices and adjourned to meet Fri
day morning at 11 o'clock.

OAKLAND, Cal.. July 6.â Meyer Cohen
asked the Salem officials to allow him to
participate in the Fourth of July festivi
ties of that place, and as they bad nothing
to show for holding him he was released.
This will probably end for the time the
sensational events of that young man.
Chief Lloyd did all he could to get a war
rant sworn to for use in the case or get the
alleged victim to put up the necessary
funds to enable him to go after Mr. Cohen.
What his intentions are have not been

OAKLAND, Cal., July 6.â Owing to the
absence of Judg<- Wood of the Police Court
the matter of sentencing Gavin D. High,

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 6. )
The Danish and Norwegian Baptists
have commenced the erection of the first
The I irst Baptist Church Built by IÂ»ani<h->orwcgian<s in California, and Its
l'astor, Rev. N. Tysa escn.
church built by their countrymen in
California. Fora long time the congre
ga.iou has been steadily growing and
some time ago it was decided to build a
church. A ready response was made to
the call for funds and when t!>e edifice is
completed it will be free from debt.
The churoti is located on the west side
of Twenty-fifth avenue, a short distance
north of East Fourteenth street. It wa*
i organized in July, 1WÂ»1, with twelve mcm
i bers and this increased many fold at the
: present time. Rev. Knute Nelson was
! pastor for the first year and the present
j pastor, Rev N. Tyschesen, was called in
i January, 1893.
For a year the regular meetings were
i held at Woodman's Hall, on Twenty-third
â  avenue. For another period they were
I heid at Liberty Hall, on Broadway, and
| finally in Knights of Pythias Hall, at
i Twenty-third avenue.
The new building has been under con
struction for some time and the founda
tion-stone was formally laid yesierday.
The ceremonies were very simple and
; the paytor delivered a short address in
i Norwegian.
"This is the first church to be built by the
Scandinavian Baptists in this State," said
! Rev. N. Tyschesen to-day. "We are
! naturally very proud of our effort, espe
| cially as we see our way clear to pay off
; every cent of the cost. For a few years
j we have been struggling under very hard
conditions, but we feel that the worst is
now past and in a few months we shall be
I able to worship in our own building. The
I members and their friends have been very
generous, and all the money needed is
either in hand or promised."
POLITICAL EQUALITY CLUB
It Is of Opinion That Women
Have Other Lines of Work
Besides on the Ballot.
Meeting of the City Trustees â Man
damus Proceedings Against the
City Treasurer.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 6.â Although
such a number of people are away on va
cations, the parlors of the wife of Judge
Waymire were filled this afternoon, when
Mrs. C. L. Wood assumed the chair of the
Women's Political Equality Club. Great
enthusiasm prevailed and a most pleasant
afternoon was spent.
Mrs. Hastie read a short extract from a
treatise entitled "The Philosophy of
Mutualism," by Professor Frank Powers,
and Miss Bowen one from "The Arena,"
dealing with the statement that tnere is
no use in science for any theory unless its
practicability can be shown.
Miss Cohen made a short speech. She
held that women were not as unselfish and
self-denying as they were deemed. They
can do something to better the present
conditions of things, whether women get
! the ballot or not. She instanced the (juan
| tity of ready-made clothing on sale in al!
! the various shops at prices so low that
| sweating alone would not account for the
| low values. "We women talk of suffrage
; and meet to organize clubs for relieving
I the poor and works of a kindred nature,"
she said, "and as soou as the meetings are
over make it a point of going to these low
| priced houses mid purchasing all our
i wants from them." She held that if
â  women would combine aud determine not
! to patronize such establishments, but pay
a fair price for what they required, they
{ would be doing good to numbers of people
; who were forced to accept starvation
\ wages. Her remarks were indorsed by
many present.
Mrs. J. Hill said that most of the
reaav-madc clothine on sale was made in
the Magdalen Asylums and the work
done by the women living in them was
done at less than Chinese wages.
Mrs. Hill spoke of the Woman's Federa
tion Association in San Francisco and in
stanced the work it was trying to accom
plish. She hoped women would be allowed
the right to vote, if it were only to reform
some of the iniquities of the City Police
courts. Here, she said, the girla who
have made their first downward step are
further contaminated and lowered by con
tact with the clerks of the courts. The
ladies who are interested la rescue work
say that they find the girls are bailed out
by the clerks of the court and its attaches.
They go out and live under their protec
tion, all trace of them is lost and the
work of reforming them becomes impos
sible.
The next meeting will be held at the
residence of Mrs. E. A. Smith, 1725 Ala
meda avenue. Branches of the society are
to be formed in San Leandro and Hav
wards and meetings are to be held at any
early date at the residences of Mrs. Gray
ami Mrs. Judge Russell in the respective
towns.
Mandamus Proceedings.
ALAMEDA. Cal., July 6.â The contrac
tor for the new machinery at the city's
electric light works, A. L. Fish, has had
his patience exhausted by the City
Treasurer. This afternoon he instituted
mandamus proceedings against R. G.
Wheeler to force him to pay the two
claims of $2500 and $7500, wbich were or
dered to be paid by the City Trustees to
him on account of hia contract. Mr.
Wheeler has for the past two months re
fused to pay these claims. He says his
bondsmen are against his making an
payments until the Fleming injunction
suit is settled.
As Judge Frick nas stated that the City
Trustees were quite justified in making
the expenditure for increased electric
power Mr. Fish will also institute a Â«uit
for damages against the City Treasurer.
A Queer Hallucination.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 6.â A young
woman named Marie Nielsen, step
daughter of Hans* P. Nielsen of Chestnut
street, was arro !â¢ â ! y -torday afternoon
on a charge of ins.mity. The unfortunate
young wonniii was examined this after
noon oy the Lunacy Commissioners and
sent to I'kiah, where she has been before.
Snc persist-* i;i saying stie is the wife of
Grover Cleveland and that he will not
give her a divorce.
Decease of v Club.
ALAMED.V, CAL., July Â«.â The El Nido
Club, Alameda's swell institution, will
soon be a thing of the past. It has never
been a financial success. Starting in with
indebtedness of several hundred dollars,
the lack of a sullicient number of mem
bers and the want of interest exhibited by
its adherents has forced it to the wall. It
will pass out of existence at the end of the
month, after a life of |tut two years.
Turning the Tables.
ALAMEDA, Cai.., July 6. âThe city of
Alameiia has commenced suit against
Emilia G. Cohen and others, under the
law of eminent doma<n, to obtain the
value of the land owned by them and re
quired for the opening of Lincoln avenue,
east of Versailles street.
Since the decision of her injunction suit
in favor of the city Mrs. Cohen has re
fused to accept the amount tendered her
by the Street Commissioners and insti
tuted action for a new trial.
> ity TruHtees.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 6.â The regular
meeting of the City Trustees was held this
evening. Correspondence was received
from the Southern Pacific Company Drom
-1 ising to attend to tbe repair of Morton
i street station and to remedy tbe constant
| ringing of the alarm bell on Park street
and Kncinal avenue. Ttie Superintendent
of Streets reported that Gray Bros.' work
on tin* sidewalks on Eighth street and
Haight avenue had been satisfactorily
completed. The engineer's report showed
an expense of $477 45 for coal and salaries
during previous month.
The Â»urn of $500 was placed to the credit
jot the health fund. Accounts amounting
Ito $2!*J :il were ordered to be paid. The
firemen were each granted fifteen days'
leave of absence.
On the question of reissuing licenses to
sell liquor all the old licenses were re
newed. An application was made for a new
license by Mr. de Brett for the Pacific
Hotel. Owing to the absence of Trustee
Hammond, the voting being equal, the
matter was laid over for one week.
Angry Kxeinpti.
OAKLAND, Cai.., July 6.â The Exempt
Firemen huve been meeting in the Police
Court in the City Hall since their organi
zation, but the Council lately passed a
I resolution forbidding "all" meetings there
j except municipal bodies.
The firemen believe the action was aimed
! directly at them. "It was a direct slap,"

SURROUNDED
IN HIS HOUSE,
Peter Thompson Finds a
Burglar on His Friend's
Premises.
CALLED THE PATROL.
A Dozen Men With Guns Close
Around the Midnight
Robber.
CHEN CAME A BIG SURPRISE.
The Owner Had Returned Suddenly
and Was Merely Inspecting
Hia Property.
Oakland Office SanFbawcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 6. j
Mr. Halbert, the capitalist of 1423 Web
ster street, narrowly escaped being shot
for a burglar last night. His home is in
the aristocratic part of town near the lake
shore district and last winter many burg
laries were committed in that district and
a sharp lookout has been kept ever since.
A few weeks ago Mr. Haibert went to
the springs with his family. He has a lot
of valuable material in his house and so
he told of his trip to his friend Peter
Thompson. Mr. Thompson owns a vast
estate and is a neighbor to Halbert. He
promised to take a look at the Halbert
house night and morning.
Last nicht Mr. Thompson waa keeping
his promise. He went to the Halbert
home and saw a light inside. He watched
and waited expectantly for several min
utes. The light reappeared in another
room. Mr. Thompson knew tnere should
be no light there and at once concluded
that a burglar, or perhaps two, were at
work overhauling Mr. Halbert's valuables.
Feier Thompson was not long in acting.
He at once laid his plans. He got together
his Japanese boy, his eldest son and Mr.
Hi^h of the Oakland Bank of Savings, who
lives next door to Halbert. and told them
of the presence of the robbers. Mr. High
went round to the back, while the Jap boy
and Mr. Thompson guarded the front. His
son he sent to the patrol box with orders
to ring up the City Hall and call the patrol
wagon. No one dared to blow a police
whistle or the robbers wouid at once be on
their mettle. Just o.ice it dawned on Mr.
Thompson that the man in the house
might be Mr. Halbert. The two friends
have a peculiar whistle with which tney
attract each others attention. Peter
Thompson whistled, but it brought no
response, and he was then positive that he
had to deal with desperadoes.
Mr. High, the Jap, and Mr. Thompson,
all armed, were guarding the approaches
to the house, when the patrol wagon
dashed up with about a dozen men in it.
Ihey at once surrounded the house and
were closing in, preparatory to capturing
the desperadoes, when the noise of the
patrol wagon disturbed the roboerand he
appeared at an upstairs window.
"Throw up your hands; you are sur
rounded," shouted one of the officers.
Two hands were raised till they nearly
touched the eaves, and a voice beseech
inzly implored the armed horde not to
shoot. It waa Halbert himself. He had
returned from the springs unexpectedly
and had lit a candle, with which he had
gone from room to room seeing that every
thing was all right. Some explanationa
were made instead of arrests, and the
frends of the two capitalists have consid
ered it advisable all to-day not to discusa
burglars in their presence.
MINISTERS TALK FINANCE
With One Exception Presbyte
rian Pastors Stand for
Gold.
Baptist Preachers Discuss a New
Brotherhood â Dr. Pona on
Resurrection.
The Presbyterian Ministerial Union held
a Quiz day yesterday, the subject dis
cussed being "The Silver Question."
Rev. Dr. Frasier, who set the subject
going, spoke strongly in favor of gold. He
condemned the Teller resolution, saying
that it was not right to call the ratio be
tween silver and gold as 1 to 16, when it
was really as Ito 25 or 30. Rev. Dr. Alex
ander said: "There are thousands of dol
lars lying idle in the banks of this coun
try already. We already have sutlicient
money; what we want is more work lor
the people; set the mills going and that
will give the peoole bread."
Rev. James Woodworth said he was not
a silver man, but he would like to see free
coinage tried for a while, to nnd oui how
it would work. Rev. Dr. Bevier, who up
held gold, said that it was the duty of min
isters to study financial questions. He
held that gold had an intrinsic value
which especially fitted it to become the
unit. "New fields of gold are being dis
covered, which make it pretty certain that
we shall not suffer for want of a gold cur
rency. On moral grounds 1 contend that
no money can long maintain its position
when it has a stamp value not equal to its
face value."
Rev. Dr. Scott was the only one of the
pastors present who made a strong stand
for silver. "Those who advocate the gold
standard tire the oppressors," he said.
"Make a single standard and you have a
means by which the standard can be mon
opolized. It is because of the rower of
monopolizing that the Rothschilds have
become the princes of finance. It is ow
ing to the gold standard that they can sit
in Europe and command our Senate." Dr.
Scott denied an intrinsic value to cold,
winch he said was oniy uselul in itself to
fill teeth and make ornaments.
Rev. Dr. Maitland and the other pastors
present expressed themselves as being in
favor of gold.
The following officers were elected for
the next six months: President, Rev.
John Hunter of Berkeley; vice-president,
Rev. J. B. Warren; secretary, Rev. James
Woodworth.

who have been drawn together by simi
larity of conviction, and who believe that
churches and pastors are absorbed in their
own affairs, and are jealous of each other,
and that internal forms are magnified and
the spirit neglected, while Christians have
been contented with a low plane of life
here and have postponed holiness for the
future. The people who hoid these views
have formed themselves into a brother
hood in order, they say, to make the king
dom of God once more the great object of
Christian preaching.
After stating the object of the brother
hood, Rev. Mr. Dietz said that for his own
part he dirt not look with any great ad
miration upon the movement, as he con
sidered it merely a step toward formulat
| ing a new sect, one that labors under a
false idea of tbe degeneration of the
church.
"Will the Brotherhood of the Kingdom
be able to unite all the so-called Chris
tians? ldo not think so. It is a hard task
to find out what they mean by the king
dom. Every organization whicn lives lov
incly together exemplifies the kingdom."
Dr. Dietz denied the charge of selfishness
brought by the brotherhood.
In the discussion the general opinion ex
pressed by the ministers was not one of in
dorsement of the brotherhood.
During the reports from churches Rev.
Dr. Russell expressed cratitude to Mr.
Yorke. "I do not say Father Yorke," he
said, "because the Bible teaches 'call no
man father.' He gave us v tine advertise
ment, and if he goes on we shall continue
to have crowded congregations."
llev. M. Karlson of the First Swedish

At the Congregational Monday Club
Rev. Dr. Pond spoke yesterday on the

of the body. He held that there are celes

the Christian doctrine of the resurrection
of the dead stands for a continuous un
broken life, which does not go on, but
goes up.
In the discussion the ministers weÂ«-e
about equally divided between belief in

TO BELIEVE THE LEPERS,
Dr. Goto's Remedies Now in
Constant Use at the
Pesthouse.
City Physician O'Brien Says They Will
Greatly Relieve the Unhappy
Patients.
The remedies of Dr. Goto for leprosy are
now in use at the Festuouse. Last Sun
day they were administered for the first
time to the patients, and so far as can be
judged ar â¢ giving satisfaction, though sev
eral months will be required in which to
mate a thorough test.
It will be remembered that sometime
ago a private subscription for the Durchase
of the medicine was started by Supervisor
C. E. Benjamin, chairman of the Health
and Police Committee, and $200, the most
of which passed through the office of The
Call, was raised. Supervisor Benjamin is
in receipt of the following self-explanatory
letter from Frank Bindt of the hospital on
Twenty-sixth street:
Dear Sir: Your Hole of yesterday's date is
at hand. The medicine was safely delivered
here last evening. This morning Dr. O'Brien
came out and arranged for us to begin using
it to-morrow evening. The arrival of the
medicine has already put new life into the
people out here and I trust that the next six
month* will show a decided improvement in
them all.
On behalf of all the patients I sincerely
thank you for what you have done for us. We
also thank the people whoso kindly contrib
uted to the funa for the purchase of the medi
cine. 1 remain, very gratefully yours,
Frank Bindt.
"The remedies in use," said Dr. A. P.
O'Brien, the City Physician, "include
pills and a tea, which are taken internally
three times a day, and a bath, which is
used daily for six successive clays. While
leprosy is incurable, this treatment, which
is generally used in the leoer settlements
of the Sandwich Islands, will, I think, al
leviate the sufferings of the patients. It
heals the ulcers and cleanses the skin.
"There are fourteen lepers now in the
hospital, and the supply of medicine will
last for say six months. .If it results as
beneficially as we expect I should be
strongly in favor of continuing it. The
cost, I should think, would not exceed
$600 or $800 a year."

HARKENED TO A
PREACHERS WORDS
Why Emma Ashley Did
Not Take Her Own
Life.
REV. MR. BIRCH'S ADVICE
She Was in Despair Over a
Series of Adverse Cir
cumstances.
HER IDEA OF WOMAN'S HONOE.
A Resolution to Destroy Herself and
Family Changed by the PasÂ»
tor's Sermon.
"I was led last Sunday week," said
Pastor W. L. Birch on Sunday morning at
Calvary Church, "by an uncontrollable
impulse to speaK words of comfort to per
sons in trouble and to any who, through
burden of poverty or for fear of discovery
of wrongdoing, contemplated suicide.
Later on there came to me a well-bred
woman of irreproachable reputation, who
said she had been brought to despair by
reason of adverse circumstances, and who,
were she to do wrong, might bs lifted from
poverty. She, however, had refused to
swerve from woman's honor, but, feeling
that there was no hope in this world, she
had resolved that night to destroy herself
and her family.
"During the sermon she felt that by
second sight I knew her case, and her
brain became balanced with the result,
and, as with sobs and tears sbe told her
tale, she had not words to express her
gratitude at being saved from the deadly
crime for which she had prepared.
"She was a woman of good education
and musical genius, and since she has
friends in New York who would be able to
assist her, yet not able to send her money,
I should be glad if this wealthy congrega
tion and other benevolent friends would
raise a fund to send her there. Please
give the money to Thomas Magee of 4
Montgomery street or to S. H. Clement of
302 Montgomery street, who I hope may
obtain reduced rates from the railroad
company."
A lady of the congregation, in response
to the pastor's appeal, at once started the
relief fund with a subscription of $5.
"I feel bound," continued the pastor,
"to tell you of a matter which greatly pains
nie. I have been more than once at the
City Prison to see Miss Timma Ashley and
I took her my Bible, since the one she used
has been seized by the legal tribunal. She
had not any remembrance of buying the
pistol, and" the awful net she attempted
seems to her to have been done by some
other one. She believes that in the im
pulse of her unbalanced mind her first in
tention was self-destruction. Regarding
the act for which she is now in prison, she
can scarcely believe she did it. But that
she knows it is a fact as related by others.
"She and her sister have suffered much
hardship. Some days they have scarcely
anything to eat, and but for the comfort
derived from the services in this church
Lillian thinks alp would have broken
down. I should like to raise a little fund
to help them.
"But what I wished chiefly to say is
that I was completely upset by the scenes
in the City Prison. In one place, which
was < xactly like the den in a wild beast
show, were a number of wretched women
lying on the seats and floor, like bundles
of dirty clothes. When I looked into one
face, with compassion in my eyes, the
woman put her hands up and burst into
sobs. Another, about 18 years of age,
looked at me, crying 'Oh, God! 1
"In the wild-beast den, next to the
won<en, were a dozen or more men, but I
could not bear the sight of them, and the
horrid smell I inhaled made me sict.
Further on was another uage, with worse
criminals, one of whom clearly showed in
sanity in his eyes, and here the suffocating
stench would, 1 think, be only equaled by
the pestilence which so grieved John How
ard when he pleaded with the world for
humanity to be shown to prisoners.
"While the bands were playing, the
glorious American flag waving and the
joyous Fourth of July being celebrated by
the crowded thousands of this City, the
fifty prisoners referred to were suffering
from our unkindness in the City Prison,
and in the name of the sacred flag we rev
erence, which means justice and human
ity, I appeal for the removal of tho horrid
wrong which is perpetrated there.
"If the City cannot provide better
and more sanitary quarters, let us, as
benevolent men and women, build a new
temporary prison. Might not this work
be undertaken by the churches? If so, 1
shall be glad to set the righteous cause
afloat by giving a hundred dollars, and if
it may be permitted, I now offer my
services as chaplain to the prisoners."
Emma Ashley, the sister of Lillian Ash
ley, who recently took a shot at E. J.
Baldwin, seems to have been a lady of de
termination.
Distressed by poverty, her reason had
become so unbalanced that she had de
liberately resolved to make away, not only
with herself, but also with her n3ter and
her child, some days before the occurrence
of the court shooting scene.
She was an attendant of Calvary Pres
byterian Church, and it was in conse
quence of the services conducted by
Pastor Birch that she was led to
abandon her murderous ideas. Her reso
lutions, though, seem to have been
founded upon sand, for when she went
into court a few days later and witnessed
the humiliation and disgrace of her sister
Lillian she forgot herself, and, acting upon
a strong impulse, fired her pistol at the
millionaire, and fortunately missed.
This sheds a new light upon her dra
matic story.
Dr.-Birch intends seeing "Lucky" Bald
win, to ask him to become a joint bonds
man with himself for the release of Emma
Ashley until the day of trial.

CENSURE SUTRO'S
CAR SERVICE.
Western Improvement Club
Wants Cars to Geary
Street.
ONLY TWO CARS A DAY.
The First Evening Car Was
Run on the Fourth of
July.
A NEW ENGINE-HOUSE NEEDED
The District Wholly Without Fire
Protection in Case of a General
Alarm.
At a regular meeting of the Western Im
provement Club last night innumerable
grievances of various natures were acted
upon. One of the foremost of t lie grievances
is against Mayor Sutro for the manner in
which he runs the branch of hia road on
Central avenue soutft of Sutter street.
The club says that the franchise in
cluded this part of Central avenue. Only
two cars in the morning have been run on
this part of the road. The first car in the
evening was run on the Fourth of July
nicht. This car was luminous with a
multitude of electric lights, but further j
than the electrical display the car was of
little use to the inhabitants of that part of
Richmond. The ciub censures the lack of
car service on t is part of the Sutro line.
It was said that the Supervisors had the
same right to puli up the rails on this
street as they had on Bush street. The
people there want a car service from Geary
street to Sutter street. It was said that
instead of making a terminal point at
Geary street Sutro has made a terminal
point at Sutter street. The terms of the
franchise state that the terminal point
shall be at Geary street.
The club also protests against the present
system in vogue on the road of charging
those who live alone the road twice the
rate that people from the ferry have to
pay.
They claim that persons starting from
the ferry pay 5 cents ana are entitled to a
ride clear to the Cliff House, thereby pay
ing only '2% cents to the Sutro road.
Those living along the road west of Cen
tral avenue are obliged to pay 5 cents also
for the short ride toward the Cliff House.
The club censured an obstruction of a
fence on the corner of Geary street and
Central avenue, and desired t at the
proper authorities may take action to
have the fence moved back to the iiue of
property.
A letter of thanks was written to Arch
bishop Kioraan for his prompt action in
having a sustaining wall built along the
south side of Calvary Cemetery. A letter
of thanks was also accorded the contractor,
Patrick Broderick, lor his efficient work
in building the sustaining wall along the
nortu side of the cemetery. This wall
averages twenty feet in height and was
built on the action of the Street Commit
tee that widened Geary street five leet at
this point.
It was recommended that a fare-engine
house be built on the proi erty near li.c
corner of Geary and Central avenue. Now j
in case of a general alarm the district
would De entirely without lire protection
as the chemical engine has been taken
away. During the Fourth an engine from
the corporation yards was stationed in
Colonel Coakley's barn. Ten extramen
were also stationed at this place. The
engine and men were removed yesterday.
1 lie lot near Geary street recommended
by the ciub is said to be the most suitable
location for an engine-house in the dis
trict. In case of a lire, no matter in what
direction, the engine would descend a bill
in responding to an alarm. From this
point the grade descends down Geary
street. Central avenue, Point Looos aye"- j
nue and Masonic avenue toward the park.
The club strongly recommends that this
piece of property be purchased for tiiis
purpose.
The Richmond Banner has lately
changed hands, the present editor and
proprietor b-ing Walter L. Lyons. The
first issue was publi*hed on July 3.
The sandhill on the corner oi First aye- â¢
nue and Geary street is rapidly being torn j
down, and the sand taken from it is being |
placed in the low lands of the old Bay
District racetrack property.
Thf also resolved to" suggest to the
Richmond Improvement Club that it in
terview the Street Committee with a view
to having Fifth avenue improved. It was !
stated that deep ruts in the roaa made
traveling over it not only unpleasant, but
almost impossible.
NEW DEMOCRATIC CLUB.
Representative Men of the Western
Addition to Organize for Practi
cal Politics.
The formation of a new Democratic po
litical club is being agitated out in the
Western Addition to comprise the repre
sentative Democratic politicians of the
Fortieth and Forty-first districts.
The club will probably be organized this
week or the week following. It will be
known as the "Jefferson Club of the West
ern Addition." Among those who are said
to be interested in it are: William O'Neil,
K. Gallagher, Colonel Coakley, E. Koch
W. Kelly, T. O'Brien, P. Epan. T. Brady',
J. Welsh, Daniel Shurin, W. Gleason,
Louis Tresmont and many otuers.
All of these men are prominent business
men of the Western Addition.
It is predicted that E. Gallagher will be
the presiding officer of the club. He is a
man who has iiad a good deal of experi
ence in politics, is well versed in parlia
mentary law, and also possesses much ex
ecutive ability.
Billy O'Neil is spoken of as secretary.
He is also a man who has had much ex
perience, having been secretary of many
prominent organizations.

Resident oi This City for Thirty
Years.
The annual election of the Society of
California Pioneers is to take place to-day.
The polls Â»vill be open from 9 a. m. to 5
P. M. So far there is but one ticket in the
held, the regular ticket, and, in the absence
of any competing ticket, it is reasonably
fcure of election. Following are the nom
inees:

toii, U. H. Ri^s, K. T. Kruce, Wek-'rield Baker,
Leon Sloss, C. J. King*
H. N. Tilden, the retiring president, in
his annual ieport. says: "Harmony and
good fellowship, so essential to the pros
perity of all societies, prevail among us;
kindly attention and generous assistance
i> being rendered to our Â»v ?*d and infirm
members who require a helping hand to
smooth the pathway of life which still
lies before them.
"The sum of $10,805 50 has been expended ,
for rrlief purooses during the past year, it
being the largest amount in any one year
since t c organization of the society.
"On the 12th day oi December, 1889,
$300,000 was borrowed by the society trum
tlie trustees oi the James Lick estate for
tbe purpose of erecting the building we
now occupy. The note of the society was
given for that amount, drawing interest at
5 per cent per annum, secured by mort
gage on the Fourth-street lot and improve
ment, the Lick trustees paying the taxes
on the property. Interest on the note
was regularly charged to the society, but
not paid, and at the time the finai settle
ment was made amounted to $82,991 43.
"With the kindly ;co-operation and as
sistance of the Lick trustees the matter
was pushed through the Probate Court and
a final decree obtained.
"Although the annual income of the so
ciety has been increased some $9000 a year
by the closing up of the Lick trust, yet in
the coming year tbe expenditures will
probably exceed the income by some
$6000.
"Taxes on the new hall and lot, amount
ing to about $3'_'oo, which were formerly
paid by the Lick trustees, will have to be
paid now by the society, and unless fur
ther donations to the relief fund are made
by our well-to-do members, from $10,000
to $12,000 a year will be required for that
purpose.
"To provide for the feeble and needy
senior members of the society is our first
and most sacred duty, and so much of the
Erincipal of the trust fund placed in our
ands by our great benefactor, James
Lick, as is required for their proper main
tenance may, and I think should be, used
for that purpose. I believe, however, thst
this fund should be preserved as far as
possible for revenue purposes, thus insur
ing the perpetuation of the society for all
time to come, which evidently was the in
tention of its founders, as expressed in
Article lof the constitution: 'In all ap- j
propriate matter to advance the interest
and perpetuate the memory of those
whose sagacity, enerjry and enterprise in- i
duced them to settle in the wilderness and i
become the founders of a new ttate.'
"It was for^tl*; effectual carrying out of
this and other objects that the descend- j
ants oi Pioneers were made eligible to j
membership."
"On the tirst of June," says Marshal J.
F. Pmkham, in his report, "I received an
invitation from the executive committee !
of the semi-centennial celebration at So- ,
noma of the hoisting of the Bear Fiag in- !
viting me to be present at such cele- !
bration with as many Pioneers ;
as could go. There was quite a |
large delegation present. Under the
direction of our president, H. N. Tilden,
I had an exact copy made of the original
Bear Flag, now in" possession of the so- !
ciety, and presented it to ihe committee I
at Sonoma. I also at their request read :
the proclamation of Captain William B.
Ide, issued at the time ot the capture of
that town. Altogether the celebration was
a success.''
Elliot M. Root, the president, who will
be elected to-day, is the surviving partner
of the wholesale grocery firm of Root &
Sanderson and now the president of the
Atlantic Dynamite Company, and is well
known In social and business circles. He
is a native of New York and has resided
in San Francisco for the last thirty-two
years.

SLEEPING IN A
WET, DARK CELL,
Some Barbarities of the
California-Street
Station.
MORE ROOM IS NEEDED.
Prisoners Facked Tighter Than
the Traditional Sar
dine.
MEN AND WOMEN BEATEN.
The Women's Single Cell Makes No
Distinction Between New and
Old Offenders.
The Board of Supervisors a short time
since roused itself to the necessity of a
woman's separate cell and especial provi
sion for women in the City Prison at the
City Hall.
The board has had time to rest from its
exhaustive labors in that instance and it
is, thirefore. time to call attention to the
needs of the California-street station in
that and other regards.
There are five cells in the California
street station. No. 1 is exclusively re
eerved for Chinamen. No. 2 is held for
sober people arrested on charges of felonies
and aggravated misdemeanors.
Nos. 3 and 4 are for drunks pure and
simple.
No. 5 is for women of all kinds and con
ditions, arrested upon whatsoever charge
they be.
To those familiar with the variety of
kinds and conditions that are nightly
found in the police dragnet â the old
drunks and utterly disreputables, the
young women with tne flush of innocence
scarcely brushed from their cheek, the
suspects, the woman dressed in :lean linen
and finery who sat too long at ncr French
dinner and discovers only when on her
way home how much wine she really did
drink â to the man who bas seen represen
tatives of all these classes thrown together
on the stone floor and the narrow benches
of th â¢ women's cell of the California-street
Station, there is suggested the need of
swift reform.
Again, when Chinatown is raided, as it
frequently is, the Chinese cell is not suffi
cient. The felony ccil â men arrested upon
complaints not proven â is emptied into
that of the common drunks, to mingle
with the filthy, vermin-infested and ill
smelling crowd.
A few nights ago the Chinese cell was so
crowded that it overflowed into No. 2 and
crowded it to such a decree that the in
mates were compelled to keep on their feet,
there not being room enough behind the
bars for them to sit down.
The two cells of the plain drnnks dur
i:vc such periods is simply unspeakable,
and the stench of the underground place
is scarcely to be mentioned to early morn
ing readers, much less dwelt upon.
Ihe prison or lock-up, it should be men
tioned, is under ground. It is necessary
in order to exist here at all to drench it
out frequently, and a hose is found always
attached to a hydrant in the passage in
front of the cells. As a consequence, the
concrete floor is always damp. A movable
board flooring is provided to be laid on
the stone. It is not always laid, however,
and men and women also are required to
sleep on the damp, stone floor.
There is in addition to the five cells
named a dark cell. Here the floor does
not drain, but that does not cause the
officers to be any more careful about put
ting down the flooring. The water some
times stands on the floor there half an
inch deep.
On the night of the Fourth the prison
was crowded in every cell. The wagon
picked up four drunks on Clay streetâ
helplessly drunk. Tbere was a fifth that
was not apparently drunk at all. He was
one John Kelly, found s itting on the step
in front of a Clay-street warehouse with a
pair of crutches beside him. He explained
that he lived at Salinas; that he had been
driver of a hose team, that his foot had
been run over and had to be amputated,
that he had come to town to see the dem
onstration here, and that, tired of walking
on his crutches, he had sat down to rest.
He was thrown into the wagon with the
other four, and his arm so wrenched that
when being taken out of the wagon at the
California-street station he had to crawl
upon nig hands and knees into the station.
The bandages on his foot were also partly
torn off, and the stitches in the flesh were
wrenched so that his progress across the
floor and down the stairs and across
the floor to the booking window was
trailed in his blood. Despite nis protest
and that of some of the bystanders, he was
booKed as that of a drunk. The bystand
ers urged that he be sent to the Receiving
Hospital, but no atteution was paid to the
suggestion.
Kelly in his turn remonstrated against
the abuse heaped upon the four "drunks"
who had come with him. They were
kicked and cuffed and draeged down the
stairs, one officer to each pulling them
by the shoulders. One of them was
speechless and unable to give his name.
He was smacked in the face and his nose
twisted brutally. As this was not effective
in bringing him to it was ordered that he
be taken to the dark cell. The dark cell

was found to be already occupied. A man j
came out of it who had been lying in a
pool of water that lay half an inch deep
on the floor. His clothes were saturated
and in this condition he was thrown into
the crowd of drunks in cell 3.
The other "drunk" who was to take his
place in the dark cell was aDout to be
'thrown in upon the wet floor when a by
stander insisted on being allowed to put
down the wooden flooring that stood
against the wall and only needed a touch
to put it in place on the floor and at least
protect the victim from the water.
The bystander referred Â«.o was an old
man who. wnen he reached the sidewalk
in front of the station and where he did
not stand in fear of arrest himself, was
free in his expressions of horror at what
he had seen.
"1 have seen a good many prisons in all
parts of the country," he said, "but such
a prison and such a treatment of prisoners
I have never seen before."
But that was only one night. The fre
quenter of this prison grows hardened to
such scenes. It is quite a common circum
stance for drunken men to be so roughly
used by the orlicers at the station as to
necessitate their being transferred to the
Receiving Hospital. That was the case
with a young man only a few weeks ago,
a burly officer throwing him to the floor
with such force as to render him insen
sible, with fears of a fractured skull.
A hysterically drunken young woman
a few nights later had her clothes almost
torn off her, after which she was thrown
into the dark cell.
These, as stated, are to the regular at
tendant at the station very ordinary inci
dents. But that is the reason why the
Supervisors should widen the scope of
their reform until it embraced this and all
the other stations so far as needs be.
Dr. Fred A. Rinne of the Receiving Hos
pital visited the prison last night and was
surprised to learn that no drugs or stimu
lants were there for cases of special emer
gency. He declared that in common hu
manity they should be provided. He will
report upon this matter.
POLICE RETIREMENTS.
The Pension CoininUgioners at Their
Meeting Yesterday Took No
Action.
The Board of Pension Commissioners of
the Police Department held its quarterly
meeting yesterday morning. The regular
bills were audited and the board ad
journed.
No action was taken as to the placing of
any officers who are over 60 years of age
and have served twenty years and over on
the pension list, and it was given out un
officially tuat the statement that several
would be retired was unwarranted.
Last year at the same meeting it was
stated previous to it that certain officers
would be retired. No action was taken,
and it was given out that there would be
no retirements. But at the next meeting
of the Board of Police Commissioners
Captains Douglass, Short and istone and
others were abked to send in their resigna
tions. It may be that something of the
Kind will occur this year at the next meet
ing of the Police Commissioners.
HIS WOUNDS PROVED FATAL.
Antonio Msrhailo Dies From a Gun-
ahot Wound While Hunting.
Antonio J. Machado, who resided at '
San Rafael, died last evening at the Ger
man Hospital from the effects of a eun- !
shot wound in the right arm. An in- !
quest was waived by the widow, and the
body will be removed to tan Rafael for in- i
terment.
While hunting at Sunol on June 29,
Machado, becoming fatigued, concluded
to rest in the snade of a friendly tree. He |
laid his gun down on the grass and was
about to take a nap when be suiec a bird
B short distance aw:ty. He gratped his j
gun by the muzzle and pulled it toward
him with the intention of taking a shot at
the bird. The trigger of the gun caught
in a twig and the gun was exploded, the
charge taking effect in his arm. Machado
was removed to the German Hospital in
this City by friend;;, but gangrene set in ]
on the wounded limb and he succumbed ]
to his injury.

SHE LOANED HIM
HER DIAMONDS
And He Has Neglected to
Return Them to
Her.
SO SHE BRINGS SUIT.
Story ot the Brief Partnership
of Mrs. Rosenthal and
M. N. Hirsch.
SHE RENTED HIM A ROOM.
And After Many Months He Moved
Out Without Paying the Long
Overdue Rent.
Mrs. Bamuel Rosenthal began two suits
in the Superior Court yesterday against
her late partner in the tobacco business,
M. N. Hirsch.
She sues for the recovery of diamonds
valued at $500 and a board and lodging
bill in the sum of $450, and a couple of
thousand more for the lease of the store
room at G24 Market street.
The story of how all this indebtedness
piled up against Mr. Hirsch, as told by
Mrs. Rosenthal, is an interesting one. Tte
diamonds, Mrs. Rosenthal says, she loaned
Hirsch, and this led to his forming new
associations, to the breaking up of tne
partnership and all the rest of it, greatly
to her monetary loss.
"My store was shut tip and I was in all
sorts of complications growing out of the
divorce proceedings with my husband,"
said Mrs. Rosenthal yesterday, "when
Hirsch came to see me and proposed that
I take him into partnership.
"Judge Hebbard, in granting the di
vorce, cave me all the community prop
erty, but required that I pay the bills con
tracted by my husband. The court also
put a bailiff in the store as receiver to
protect the interests of creditors.
"About that time I discharged a clerk, a
boy named Jacobs, as I wanted to econo
mize, and for revenge be went to the cus
toms authorities and informed them that
the bailiff, Keilly, was selling tobacco not
properly stamped.
Then the United States courts under
took to put a bailiff in in place of that of
tne Superior Court, and theresult was that
between the two â Judge Ilebbard resisting
â my store was closed so far as my busi-
Iness was concerned.
B"i had a 'to let' in the window for half
Ithe store. That attracted this man
Hirsch, or at least he made it his excuse
for coming to see me. After talking for
some time about renting he asked me if I
would not take him in as a partner. He
said he would give bonds to the court and
so enable us to resume business and would
pay me $3,500 for a half interest. The
stock had been inventoried at over $11,000,
but 1 was in such straits, as you see,
that the knife was practically at my
throat. I could not act on my own ac
i count, for my friends were doubtful about
the outcome of the tangle between the
two courts and to get bonds wa3 there
fore a difficult matter. So I decided to
accept the offer of Hirsch.
"He had b. en living in Alaska for a
number of years, and looked shabby be
hind my counter. I offered to lend him
some of my diamonds in order to give him
' a more spruce appearance. Besides he
said he wanted to go to the Concordia
Club to see some ladies there. I loaned
him the jewelry, and he has made very
good use of it. He lias never returned it
to me. He became engaged to marry a
i fine young lady. Then he wanted to se-
I cure all of my store. He said he had bor
| rowed Â£.'.500 from his brother, Charles
Hirsch, notwithstanding the agreement
between us that he must not sign notes
without my permission.
"The store was attached. My lawyer
wanted to fight it but I said no; I would
sell out and I did. I was to have received
$800 from the sale but did not get a cent.
"At the time we sold out Hirsch owed
me for nine months board and lodging.
He had been living out in the Mission
somewhere and complained that it was a
difficult thing for him to get down in the
morning to open the store. I then offered
to rent him the front room of my apart
ments over the store at a low rate. He
readily accepted, out never paid me any
rent. When I asked him for it he would
complain that times were hard and
promise to pay me in a lump. But that
was all I gotâ promises.
"So I gave the whole matter into the
hands of Mr. Raver to collect. That is
the story of the suit."
SOCIALISTS IN COURT.
William Cotttey's Case DismUaed by
Police Judge Joachiinsen.
The case of William Costley, the social
ist, was threwn out of Police Court 3
yesterday by Judge Joachimsen because
the officers who made the arrest were not
present to prosecute. Costley's case at
tracted considerable attention recently.
He and a number of other socialist lectur
ers were holding an open-air meeting on
Thursday night on Seventh street, near
Market. When about half through his
discourse he was ordered by the police to
leave the locality.
Costley promptly refused to do so, claim
ing the rights of free speech, and for his
refusal he was arrested and locked up in
the Southern police station on a charge of
disturbing the peace. From subsequent
inquiries it was learned that the Odd Fel
lows objected to these 6treet-gatherings,
claiming that the speakers disturbed the
meetings in the buildings.
Not only were the socialists interested
but the labor unions, and it is said that
the Free Press Defense Association were
going to Costley's defense and had the
case been decided against the accused
there is no doubt that it would have been
carried to the Superior and even to the
Supreme Court if necessary.
When Costley went into court yesterday
he was accompanied by a large number of
his associates and those interested in free
speech. Why the arresting officers were
not present to prosecute is a matter of
conjecture. The Judge said that he would
not put Costley to any further annoyance
if the arresting officers" were not sufficiently
interested to be present when the case waÃ
called.
PUBLIC SCHOOL MONEY,
There Will Not Be Any Dock
ing This Year of Teachers'
Salaries.
It Is the Intention to Expend a Big
Sum for Urgently Needed
Repairs.
The public school teachers will not be
docked this year in their salaries. It is
also the opinion of the directors thafc there
will be sufficient money received by them
to pay all of the current expenses of the
ensuing year.
What the sum will be cannot be stated
exactly until the figures are received from
the State Superintendent of Public In
struction at Sacramento and the appro
priation is made by the Board of Super
visors. It is known, however, that the con
templated building of the High School
desired at the Mission will have to be
abandoned, and while it is expected that
there will be sufficient money for repairs
there will not be any for the erection of
new schoolhouses.
The latest statement filed with the
Board of Education by the Finance Com
mittee shows the total expenditures for the
! fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, to be
| $1,03Â«i,4-'4 72. Contracts for improvements
at the Bornal Heights, Cooper, Denman,
Harrison and Columbia schools, which
are under wav but have not yet been paid,
tmonnt to $50,000. The total receipts
were $893,965 a.id the estimated sum
which will he received from the State
school fund is $2:20,000.
It has been recommended by H. D.
: Dunne, the erpert of the Grand Jury, that
; $1,200,000 br allowed the School Depart
ment, which sum will be comparatively
satisfactory to the directors. Contracts
| will be let at once for the whitening of
: sixty schoolhouses, and it is the intention
to expend in various repairs during the
year the sum of $ltiVoo. All of the pub
lic schools wiil then be in a good sanitary
condition.

MASQUERADING IN
MEN'S ATTIRE.
Mrs. Mamie Roland or Bald
win of Sacramento
Arrested.
WAS DOING THE TOWN.
She Was Dressed in a Natty
Suit of Blue Clothes and
Brown Hat.
HER SHOES BETRAYED HEE.
Judge Campbell Orders Her to Appear
for Sentence To-Morrow
Morning.
One of the "new women" from Sacra
mento appeared in Judge Campbell's court
yesterday morning to answer a charge of
violating one of the City ordinances by
masquerading in men's attire.
About 6 o'clock in the morning Police
men Webster and Richter were standing
on Post and Kearny streets when what
they supposed to be three nattily dressed
young men passed them. They were
laughing and chatting gayly and having a
good time generally.
Something peculiar in the one in the
center attracted the attention of the offi
cers. The face was smooth, the bust was
full and the feet were very small for a
young man. Besides, a straggling lock or
two of blonde hair could be seen dangling
over the neck.
The officers followed the trio and asked
them to stop. They charged the one in
the center with being a woman. She
niushingly admitted the soit impeach
ment and the result was she was sent in
the patrol wagon to the City Prison, where
she was booked for masquerading in male
uttire.
She said she was a married woman, 30
years of age, and gave the Fame Mamie
Roland. Subsequently she admitted that
her husband's name is Baldwin and that
he is a well-known politician in Sacra
mento.
She wore a natty suit of blue clothes
that fitted her well-shaped figure to per
fection and a brown Fedora hat. Her
scarf, collar, cuffs and shirt were of the
latest style. Her dainty shoes were the
only feature of her attire that was Dot
ma>culine.
The courtroom was crowded and when
she appeared she was the cynosure of all
eyes. She bore the scrutiny with becom
ing modesty.
"What do you plead to this charge of
wearing men's clothes?" asked the
Judge.
"Guilty," she said, "but I wish you
would let me off. It's the first time I was
ever arrested and I didn't know it was
against the law. It was all a joke."
"Where do you live?"
"At Post and Kearny."
"Where did you get the clothes?"
"They are my brother's."
"Are you single?"
"No; I'm married."
"Where is your husband?"
"He is in Sacramento."
"So you thought you would have a good
time, eh ?"
"I just wanted to celebrate the Fourth,
and then I wanted to see some of the sa
loons where women can't go."
Her attorney begged the court to allow
her to go on her own recognizance, as it
was her first offense.
"I won't do any such thing, 1 ' retorted
the Judge. "This case is much more seri
ous than appears on the face of it. If we
let these new women wear our clothes they
will be wanting to wear our whiskers by
and by, and then where will we men get
off? The defendant is ordered to appear
for sentence Wednesday morning, and in
the meantime I would advise her to change
her clothes."
The Judge fixed her bonds at $100, which
were immediately forthcoming, and she
left the courtroom with her friends.
HOW THE HALL WILL BE,
New Municipal Building to Be
Erected on an Old
Site.
Revised Plans Finally Accepted by
the Board of Supervisors.
The Plan.
The new municipal building to be
erected on the site of the old City Hallâ
the eround space extending on Ktarny
street from Mercnant to Washington, and
on Merchant from Kearny to Dunbar
alley â should be a handsome addition to
the public edifices of San Francisco. The
Legislature authorized the Board of Super
visors to appropriate $300,000 for the build
ing and permanent fixtures. The Super
visors reserved $25,000 to pay for plans, ad
vertisingnnd incidental expenses, leaving
$275,000 for the building proper.
It is provided in the act that the entire
work shall be included in one contract.
This provision was made to obviate delay
in construction. The building should be
finished and ready for use within one year
from this time.
The plans of the architects, Shea <fe Shea,
which the Supervisors have finally ac
cepted, promise an or namental as well as
a substantial building. An example of
the Italian renaissance in heavy rustic
stone will be shown in the first and second
stories. The upper, or third, fourth and
fifth stories, will be In pressed brick and
terra cotta. The building will rise to the
height of 75 feet above Kearny street, and
the top of the tall tower will be 120 feet
above the sidewalk curb.
The structure is to be of steel frame and
fireproof throughout. There are no wooden
joists. The flooring is to be the only
thing wooden abou*, the house.
Tbe plans provide for three entrances, a
main entrance on Kearny ami one on Mer
chant and another on Washington street.
The architects contend that the entrance
on Merchant street will be quite as ample
and convenient as that which led from the
same thoroughfare to the interior of the
old City Hall. There is this difference,
however. The main floor, or the hrst one
above the basement in the old building,
was reached bj a flight of steps ascending
from the street. In the new structure one
will enter the basement from the sidewalk
level and pasÂ« through a corridor to an
interior stairway and elevator connecting
with the upper stories. Lawyers, business
men and others who are called on to visit
the hall daily may insist on a passageway
leading to the main floor directly from
Merchant.
The Kearny-street entrance may be in
j one sense the most important, but the
majority of citizens having business to
transact in the hall will, as of old, seek the
entrance on Merchant street. Should their
wishes be ignored steps may be taken to
cause a suspension of work "until the de
sired changes are made.
The police courts, the administrative de
partments of the police, and the criminal
departments of the Superior Court will be
provided with ample accommodations in
the new house. The drillroom for the
police will be in the basement. â  The cells
for prisoners will be on the top floor, and
will be so arranged that men, women and
boys may be separated and the hardened
criminals placed apart from other prison
ers. No keys will be used for unlocking
cells. A mechanical device at a central
point will lock or unlock any cell on the
floor.
Two spacious electrical elevators with
speed attainment of 300 feet per minute
will be provided for eeneral public use. In
addition there will be a large secret or cell
elevator in which to transfer prisoners
from the van to the rotunda, or from the
rotunda to the courtroom.
Special attention has been given to the
sanitary requirements of the Receiving
Hospital. The hospital will be located on
the main floor, or the first above the base
ment, facing Merchant street and Dunbar
alley. The building throughout is to be
heated by steam.
CAUGHT ROBBING A STORE.
f.. K. Kalston and Ihomas Curley
P aced Cnder ArrÂ«Â«t.
L. E. Ralston, a young man, was seen
leaving the grocery of Henry Muller,
corner of Sutter and Devisadero streets,
about 2 o'clock yesterday morning, by Po
licemen Tuchler and Keys and Special
Offier Doyle. He had a box of cigars un
der his arm.
The store was open, but Muller was in
the barroom in the rear. The officers
questioned Ralston and found that his
pockets were filled with cigars. They de
tained him and on entering the store "they
found Thomas Curley, an ex-convict, try
ing to open the cashregister. Curley was
also arrested. As the store was open a
charge of burglary could not be preferred
against them, so Ralston was booked for
petty larceny and Curley for attempt at
petty larceny.
WOMEN ARE ORGANIZING.
An Extended System of Precinct
Clubs in Process of
Formation.
The Eniire State Will Be Embraced !
in the Far-Reaching Plan of
Campaign.
"Oh, isn't it just too lovely! It seems
too good to believe. Only to think, we are I
going to work the entire State, precinct by !
precinct. We surely cannot fail."
These anil an infinitude of less coherent j
exclamations are making the air rosy in |
the vicinity of the woman suffrage head- i
quarters.
Tho facts which have evoked this burst
of enthusiastic rejoicing are briefly as fol
lows: For some time past the leading
friends of the woman suffrage cause have
been cautiously sounding their way to
ward the realization of a pet scheme â the
establishment of an organized system of
precinct clubs. A number of meetings
have been held, at which the matter has
been discussed at length, but without any
definite result.
The last meeting of the State Central
Committee, however, settled the matter,
and a viuorous campaign is now in process
of organization. Those present were: Miss
.Mary G. Hay, chairman of the committee,
Mrs. A. A. Sargent, Miss Susan B. An
thony, Mrs. J. H. SwiH and Mrs. Nellie
Hulbrook-Bliim, being the entire person- 1
nel of the committee, with the exception
of Mrs. Austin Terry, who was absent from
the City. At this meeting the matter of
the precinct clubs was again formally
brought up. There was much discussion
as to the probable outcome of the project.
As is usual in such gatherings, some timid j
spirits hung back. All were a unit in their j
belief that their proposed plan of cam- I
paign was a good one, but would it work?
The iadies uo not care to say just now
they answered the timorous queries of the
doubting Thomasinas. The latter contin
gent was, however, vanquished, and pasbed
over to the ranks of the bolder spirits, who
have made up their minds that in spite of
all opposition, in spite of ridicule and in
defiance of all the croakers, male and
female, the plan shall work, for they will
make it work.
Accordingly the work has commenced in
this City, and in the course of a few days
will be inaugurated in the interior towns,
about twenty of the largest of which are
anticipating the organization of clubs. The
local work is in charge of Mrs. Clara Long,
who has in the space of less than a week
proved herself a most able organizer. As
soon as the clubs are formed regular meet
ings will be held at each of them, with ad
drestes by such eloquent lady orators as
Miss Anthony, the Rev. Anna Shaw and
Mrs. Chapman-Catt.
Meanwhile great interest in the woman
suffrage movement is rife in the interior
towns. Requests for suffrage pamphlets
are Douring in at the headquarters day
after day in constantly increasing volumes,
and the stenographers, typewriters and
secretaries are taxed to their utmost in
order to keep the correspondence an
swered up to date.
"The keynote to the entire suffrage
movement," said Miss Hay yesterday, 'is
confidence â confidence in the justice of
our cause, confidence in the efficient aid
of our powerful friends, among whom The
Call was first and is reckoned chief, and
above all confidence in the glorious vic
tory which awaits us in November."
