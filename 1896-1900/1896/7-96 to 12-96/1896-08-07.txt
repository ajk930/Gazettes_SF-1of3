STRUCK ON
BILLY ROCK,
Mysterious Wreck of a Ship
Off the Falkland
Islands.
IDENTITY OF VESSEL NOT
KNOWN.
It Is Believed That About Twenty
Americans Perished in
the Disaster.
ATTEMPTS TO RESCUE THEM
MADE IN VAIN.
The Only Clew to This Puzzling Ocean
Horror May Be Obtained From
a Lawn-Mower.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 6.-The
Falkland Islands, off the coast of Pata
gonia, were in May the scene of a marine
disaster involving the loss of nearly
twenty American lives, which as yet re
mains wrapped tn mystery. But few de
tails af the disaster have yet been received
from the United States Consul at Port
Stanley.
Consul Miller reports that on the even
ing of May 14 news was brought that a
large ship, evidently of American build,
had struck on tbe Billy Rock. The Falk
land Islands Company's launch was
pressed into service with a volunteer crew,
commanded by Patrick McPherson, master
of the bark Bankville of Liverpool, and
went tc the rescue.
The rough sea, however, Captain Mc-
Pherson found prevented him from get
ting close to the ship. He brought her,
however, near enough to count fourteen
men in the rigging, who hailed him in
English and begged him to rescue them.
Captain McPherson put back to port for
a lifeboat and returned immediately, but
before he returned the ship had broken
up. The rescue party stood by all night
in the hope of picking- up tbe survivors,
but, after sixteen hours' unwearried
effort, gave up the hope of saving life and
returned to Port Stan.ey.
Late in May a divei went down into the
vessel, but was unable to ascertain its
name or hailing port. The only trace of
humanity found on board was the body of
a young woman about 18 years old,
dressed in a maroon-colored dressing
gown, with a gold watch chain about her
neck, but nothing to furnish a clew to Her
identity.
The body was buried according to the
Episcopal service by the Government of
.Falkland.
Several articles were recovered from the
wreck, but the only one giving a clew to
the identity of the vessel was part of a
lawn-mower, marked on the outside of
the wheels, "Philadelphia lawn-mower,"
and on the inside, "Philadelphia, style M,
1895." The receivers of the condensers,
of which the diver reports a number of
different sizes, were marked, "Manu
factured for Holbrook, Merrill & Stetson,
San Francisco and Sacramento."
FLOODS IN NICARAGUA,
Heavy Loss of Life Occasioned
by a Sudden Rise of Shal
low Rivers.
Plantations in the Valleys of the
Rama and Siquia Completely
Overflowed.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Aug. 6.â A special from
El Rama, Nicaragua, reports one of the
greatest disasters that ever visited that
country. The heavy rains which fall at
this season of the year have caused a rapid
rise in the Rama and Siquia rivers.
The water overflowed the banks and in
undated tbe country for miles around. It
rose so rapidly that many of the inhab
itants could not escape. Moderate esti
mates place the loss of life at twenty, but
those who know say that later reports will
show that a far greater number perished.
In El Rama only fifteen buildings were
left standing. All the plantations in the
vicinity of the town are destroyed. The
loss of property is folly $1,000,000.
Panic-stricren people took refuge on
the high grounds. A number were also
taken on board the small steamers in the
rivers. The rivers continue to rise, and it
is hard to say just where the flood will
stop. The country in that vicinity is low
and has had several floods before, but
never any equal to the present inundation.
The rainy season begins in May and lasts
until January, and the rains are very
heavy. This year they have been un
usually so.
The Rama River rises in the hills of the
San Chontales district between Lake
Nicaragua and the Caribbean Sea. It is a
small river and is navigable for only a few
miles from itÂ« mouth. The district of San
Chontales, where the Roma rises, is cele
brated for its gold mines, of which there
are more than 300. Copper, iron, tin, lead,
zinc, antimony and quicksilver are found
in abundance.
The plantations along the course of the
Rama are among the richest of the world,
produoing cocoa, cotton, rice, indigo, to
bacco and corn in great abundance. So
rich is the soil and so favorable the
ciimate that two or three crops of sugar
The San Francisco Call
and two crops of corn are raised each
year. Although the loss to the planta
tions is very heavy the recuperative power
of the land is such that the damage will
not be permanent.
The flooded district is just north of the
San Juan River, the proposed route of the
Nicaragua canal.
DEFEATED THE MATABELES.
Put in Doing So the British Forces Suf-
fered a Loss, Major Kershaw Being
Among the Slain.
BULUWAYO, South Africa, Aug. 6.â
The British column under the command
of Colonel Plumer had an engagement
yesterday with the impis or regiments of
Chiefs Sekombes and Umlugulas, and
three other impis of rebellious Matabeles.
The rebels were completely routed, but
Major Kershaw and four non-commis
sioned officers of the British forces were
killed and fifteen men wounded.
It is estimated that 300 of the Matabeles
were killed.
BEAUTIFUL FLOATS DISPLAYED,
The fourth Annual flower Carnival of
Colorado Springs.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Aug. 6.-
The fourth annual flower carnival of
Colorado Springs was held here to-day and
was a big success. The city was in holi
day attire and the streets were filled with
thousands of visitors from every section
of the State. The flower parade was two
miles long and marie many gorgeous dis
plays. Floats symbolizing the evolution
of history in the West and parties of
early explorers and pioneers were among
the greatest attractions. Regular troops
and genuine Indians from the Ute reser
vation were in attendance. Governor Mc-
Intyre and staff, Governor Richards of
Wyoming and many other prominent
Western men were present.
IRREGULAR TARIFF RATES
Railroad Officials Refuse to Take
Commissioners Into Their
Confidence.
Therefore Little Progress Is Made in
the Inquiry Into the Law
Violations.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 6.â The Inter
state Commerce Commission made very
sow progress to-day in the direction of
finding any irregularities in freight rates
charged by the railroad people.
C. AI. Parser of the Missouri Pacific was
on the stand this morning and admitted
that his road had hauled grain at six
cents, but said it was only to points
within the State of Missouri, and the
commission has no authority over State
rates.
D. Miller, traffic manager of the Mis
souri, Kansas and Texas line, was an
obliging witness, but as bis road hauls
little or no freight under the varying rate
little information was elicited from the
gentleman. Several other railroad officials
were examined and found in the same
category as Mr. Miller. Nothing was
learned.
In the afternoon A. B. Stickuey, presi
dent of the Great Western, was on the
stand. He explained that the Anglo-
American Company acted as brokers for
the lowa Developing Company and that
the stock of the latter company is held by
the Great Western road. One of tne com
missioners suggested that this is equiva
lent to the railroad being in the grain
business and gave them a great advantage
over the ordinary dealer. Mr. Stickney
said that the question involved points of
law which he could not discuss.
The commissioners will continue their
labors to-morrow.
SACKING OF HERAKLION.
Christian Residents Ejected by the Mus
sulmans and the Governor Serious//
Wounded.
LONDON, Eng., Aug. 6.â The Daily
News will print to-morrow a dispatch from
Canea, under date of August 5, saying
that a body of 10,000 Mussulmans forced an
entrance into Heraklion and ejected all
the Christian residents from their houses.
The News will also publish a dispatch
from Athens, dated August 5, confirming
the report that a massacre had occurred at
Heraklion. The number of persons killed,
the dispatch adds, is not known. Hassan
Pasha, the Governor of Heraklion, was
seriously wounded.
The Central News has also received ad
vices confirming the report of a massacre,
and adding that the town of Heraklion
was sacked and the Russian vice-consul
stationed there seriously maltreated.
MAY MEAN ANOTHER STAR.
Under a Chief the Choctaxo Jfation Is to Be
Prepared for Statehood.
ATOKA, I. T., Aug. 6.â Hon. Green Me-
Cnrtain, candidate for President of the
Choctaw Nation, has carried tbe election,
and the intermarried citizens are assured
their full rights as citizens. Captain Mc-
Kennon of the Dawes commission arrived
at Atoka this afternoon- and seems to De
gratified with the results of the election.
He says the way for allotment and State
hood for the Territory is opened, and with
McCurtain as chief and a full equal di
vision of the Council another star can be
seen appearing on the flag. T&e other
candidates and their supporters intimate
that the end is not yet, and that they may
appear in war paint before the chief is in
augurated.
A MIXED MARRIAGE.
White Man and Colored Maid Licensed
to Wed.
DETROIT, Mich., Aug. 6. -John Pe
trosky, a white man, yesterday applied for
a permit to marry Julia Spann, a colored
girl, 18 years old. The license clerk re
fused to give the permit without the writ
ten consent of the girl's parents. That
was obtained and the license issued yes
terday.
The pair went to Judge Shellenberger to
have the ceremony performed, but he
flatly refused, saying: "I will not join
people of these two races in matrimony.
1 have conscientious scruples against it,
and there is nothing in tbe law to compel
me to perform the ceremony."
This is tbe first time in the history of
Detroit that a license has been issued to a
white man and a colored woman. Col
ored men have repeatedly married white
j women.

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Aug. 6.âMar
cus A. Hanna dropped over here to-day
on his way from New York to Cleveland,
and held a consultation with a sub-com
mittee of the Business Men's National
Campaign Committee upon the campaign.
The sub-committee which met Mr. Hanna
was representative of the leading manu
facturing and business firms ol the city.
Mr. Ha ana arrived here at 3:12 o'clock
this afternoon from New York, with Con
gressman Butterworth of Ohio, who met
him by chance on the train.
Charles C. Harrison, the millionaire su
gar-refiner and provost of the University
of Pennsylvania, met Mr. Hanna at the
station and escorted him to the Stratford
Hotel, where he met ex- Postmaster-Gen- ,
eral Wanamaker, ex-Minister to Russia
Charles E. Smith, editor of the Philadelphia
Pres; Thomas Dolan, the manufacturer;
Rudolph Blankenburg, chairman of the
sub-committee of the Business Men's
Committee; Theodore C. Searc i, president
of the National Association of Manfactur
era; Howard B. French, the wholesale
druggist, and several other prominent
gentlemen, including these Democrats of
wealth and prominence : William Singerly,
proprietor of the Philadelphia Record;
Joseph H. Sinnot, of the distilling firm of
Moore & Sinnot, and Frank Thompson,
vice-president of the Pennsylvania Rail
road.
Mr. Converse explained that the object
of the Business Men's National Campaign
Committee was to co-operate with the
National Republican Committee and assist
it in the coming campaign by the raising
of money for the campaign expenses, the
dissemination of sound money literature
aud the establishment of headquarters for
this purpose in various cities in different
parts of the country.
Headquarters have now been established
in Boston, and it was explained that Mr.
Blankenburger would go to Chicago on
Monday next to see some prominent busi
ness men and establish headquarters in
tbat city.
Mr. Singerly, speaking as a Democrat,
said that the question of the present cam
paign was one greater than that of party
politics, and that it was a question of pre
serving the National honor and financial
integrity.
Mr. Hanna said that he was in hearty
sympathy with tbe objects of the associa
tion, and expressed himself as grateful for
the help that it would accord the National
Committee in its work.
AN APPEAL FOR HELP.
Mr. Hanna was afterward entertained qt
dinner at the Union League Club house by
Silas W. Pettitt, president, of the club,
and at 8:50 left for Cleveland.

Provisional Committeemen Who Wi 1
Thoroughly Canvass the Situation
Before Acting.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 6.â The
indications point to a large representation
of distinguished Democrats, aside from
the members of tbe committee. It is
known that at least thirty-five and pos
sibly thirty-nine States will be represented
by committeemen, selected as follows:
Alabamaâ J. M. Falkner, Montgomery.
Californiaâ E. B. Pond, San Francisco.
Connecticut â David A. Wells, Norwich.
Floridaâ B. L. Gaskins, Jacksonville.
Georgiaâ T. B. Neal, Atlanta.
Illinoisâ John M. Palmer, Springfield.
Indiana â John R. Wilson, Indianapolis.
lowaâ L. M. Martin, Marshalltown.
Kansasâ Eugene Hagan, Topeka.
Kentuckyâ R. T. Tyler, Pickman.
Marylandâ John E. Semmes, Baltimore.
Massachusetts â Nathan Mat hews Jr.,
Boston.
Michiganâ Thomas A. Wilson, Jackson.
Minnesotaâ F. W. McCutcheon, St.
Paul.
Mississippiâ Edgar S. Wilson, Missis
sippi City.
Missouri â L. C. Krauthaff, Kansas City.
Montanaâ Charles Conrad, Kalispel.

Vermontâ W. H. Creamer, Montpelier.
Virginia â E. C. Venable, Petersburg.
Washingtonâ Thomas Burke, Seattle.
West Virginiaâ H. C. Simms, Hunting
ton.
Wisconsinâ Ellis B. Usher, La Crosse.
Aside from these, Maine, Louisiana and
North Dakota are expected to send sepre
sentatives. Colorado selected Louis Eh
rich, but he is detained at home by ill
ness.
The meeting of the committee will be
held at the Commercial Club beginning at
2 o'clock to-morrow afternoon and it is not
likely that the committee will at this ses
sion determine anything farther than the
question of whether or not to call a con
vention. The situation in each State, as
explained by its representatives, will be
carefully canvassed before a conclusion on
this subiect is reached. Then if it is de
termined to call a convention the time
and place will probably be left to be de
termined at a session Saturday morning.
While the sessions of the committee will
not be opened to the public not only the
committeemen but all of the sound money
Democrats who have come to the city will
be invited in and their views consulted.
If it is determined to call a convention,
which is entirely likely, Indianapolis will
make a strong plea for the gathering. The
joint committee of the Commercial Club
and the Board of Trade will guarantee
the expenses of the gathering and will
make a good showing of tne city's capac
ity. It has also been invited to come to
Minneapolis, Detroit, Louisville and Chi
cago, but tme choice seems to be between
this city and Chicago. After the first ses
sion to-morrow the visiting Democrats
will be entertained at lunch and with a
drive about the city tendered by the Com
mercial Club.
v A canvass made of the sentiments of the
thirty-five 'cbmmitteemen who will be in
to-morrow's meeting snows that twenty
nine of them will ' favor another conven
tion and ticket. The six who are opposed,
because they would rather make the fight
and let voters go for the Republican ticket,
include :"'. Texas, Georgia, â¢ 'Alabama and
three Eastern States. The northern States
of the West and Middle West, where the
fighting ground is supposed to be, a.c in
favor . of I a new } ticket. .Th ' ill ;be de
cided upon ;at to-morrow's meeting and a
sub-committee will be appointed to draw
up an address to the sound money Demo
crats of \ the country, givinc the reasons
why a third ticket is necessary. This will
be adopted at . Saturday's â  meeting of the
committee and the time and place of hold
ing the convention will then be fixed. It
will be held ,, during the first week in Sep
tember, and the committeemen now in the
city believe it will be held at Indianapolis.
Much comment is excited by the atti
tude of the Eastern leaders. While all the
Eastern 1 States except \ New Jersey and
Delaware will * be represented =at to-mor
row's meeting they will not be represented
by party leaders nor by men who have the
party organization behind them. ; Neither
Mr. s Cleveland nor any of the men close to
him has spoken a word of ; encouragement
for the 'movement," and the impression is
fast growing that they prefer to have the
sound ; money Democracy make a fight for
principle' and ' throw its strength to !.t he
support of the Republican ticket. i Much
disappointment has been caused by the
receipt of a dispatch from Colorado
Springs, stating that Louis Ehrich, the
well-known sound money leader, is ill
there and will be : unable to attend the
conference. For this ' reason the ' mass
meeting proposed for Saturday night has
been called off, thus spoiling another im
portant feature of the gathering.

NASHVILLE, Aug. 6.â One of
the hottest fights made i for political â 
office }in Davidson County culminated in
the ,\' election to-day. Democrats and
A. P. A.'s waged relentless war for weeks.
Much bitterness was engendered, and the
recent killing of I Tim 1 . M. Hanifin, editor
of a labor ] paper, by Deputy Sheriff Alex
Barthell, an â " A. P. A., played a * conspicu
ous part in to-day's results. "
To-night excited mobs surround the

ing the returns ,' favorable 'to * their candi
dates. It now : seems to be a complete
victory for the i Democratic ticket, which
was int;loribusly snowed ' under two years
ago 1 by the A. P. A.'s. However, the vote
is ; much V lighter than expected. In , the
State elections indications point to 'a safe
majority for the Democratic " delegates of

In county elections ; honors are easy,
many important tickets meeting with suc
cess owing to the effect \of fusion between

In the Ninth District the returns indi
cate that Richard Pierce has defeated Mc-

In the Eighth District it now appears
that Hon. B. A. Enlow will be the Demo

BREAN'S SPEECH REVISED.
By Quotation Marks He Dodges the
Charge of Plagiarism.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 6.â The
first installment of the revised edition of
Mr. Bryan's Chicago speech was received
at Democratic headquarters to-day, ard
will soon be circulated, as there is an
enormous demand for the document. It
bears the evidences of having been care
fuily gone over by the author, for the al
terations in grammatical construction and
verbiage number 118. Among the correc
tions made is a reduction from thirty to
twenty years as the period fixing tbe time
during which the Republicans have tried
to secure an international agreement. An
entire new sentence appears at the conclu
sion of the paragraph, in which Mr. Bryan
defies the finding of a record in history
where the common people of any land
have declared in favor of the gold standard.
This new sentence reads as follows:
"They can rind where the holders of
fixed investments have declared for a gold
standard, but not where the masses have."
The extracts from the speech of Secre
tary Carlisle are quoted, as is also the
closing reference to the crown of thorns
and the cross of gold, thus removing the
charge of plagiarism tbat has been made
in some quarters. The entire speech has
been paragraphed and much attention
given to the punctuation.
"The speech will be found," said Sen
ator Faulkner, "to contain only such cor
rections as are needed to correct the
errors that might naturally be found in a
speech that has been taken down steno
graphically and not subjected to the
scrutiny of the man who delivered it."

During the Exchange of Shots John
Dessart, the Gritty Official,
Was Wounded.
TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 6.â Word was re
ceived in Tucson early this afternoon that
the International Bank of Nogales bad
been held up. The latest facts obtainable
are from various private and official tele
grams.
The attack was made upon the bank at
12:30 p. m., the time being well selected,
as but one man was on duty at the noon
hour, the president, John Dessart, being
the only person in the bank when two
armed men stepped into his presence and
demanded the money in his care, while
three accomplices remained on watch out
side.
President Dessart showed fight and fired
in return when they made an attempt to
kill him. He succeeded in holding them
off until the noise of the firing attracted
assistance. Mr. Dessart was hit by one
of the bandits' shots, but the wound was
not serious.
The robbers made good their escape,
starting in the direction of Calabasas. A
posse of citizens was at once organized and
started in pursuit, Nogales being in a state
of high excitement.
Later reports by way of San Bernardino
ranch, Sonora, nine miles over the line,
state (hat five Americans passed. They
were well armed, and one appeared to be
wounded. The Nogales citizens' posse was
in close pursuit.
Sheriff Leatherwood and a deputy left
Tucson this evening for the line to head
off the bandits in case they swerve to this
side again, as they are described as ali be
ing Americans, five in number.
Mr. Dessart, the plucky president who
stood off the bank-robbers, is well known
in Southern Arizona, and the latest re
ports are that he is only slightly injured.
FRESNO ROBBERS FOILED
Timely Arrests Spoiled a Job
Arranged for Last Monday
Night.
Confession That Will Probably Break
Up a Notorions Band of
Desperadoes.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 6.â Deputy Con
stable Crutcher, who recently effected tbÂ»
arrest of Ed Vanderzweip and Frank
Quintera, highwaymen and robbers, has
secured positive evidence that had the ar
rests been delayed one day Vanderzweip
and one of his pals would have attempted
to crack a safe in the store of Murrell &
Taylor at Mariposa and I streets. Quin
tera has confessed all the doings of the
gang of robbers. Nearly every robbery
and burglary which has taken place in the
city and vicinity during the past year is
now laid to this gang.
It is believed that Quintera is telling a
straight story. He and Vanderzweip have
both been identified by Messrs. Oreen and
Latter, whom they held up east of the
city last Sunday night. Quintera has in
formed Officer Crutcher of all details of
plans which had been laid to rob Murrell
& Taylor's store. It was to have taken
place last Monday night.
Vanderzweip. has boasted that he can
open any safe in the country, and has
claimed that he and his brother Jim (now
in San Quentin) robbed a safe in San Fran
cisco more than a year aeo. The crime re
ferred to was a peculiarly bold and adroit
one. Cracksmen one night entered a saloon
and restaurant on a busy street, solved the
combination of the safe and stole $730 in
coin and many other articles of value. An
attempt to fasten the crime on the Vander
zweips will be made by Detective Gibson
of San Francisco.
SALINAS MASS-MEETING.
Indignant Taxpayers Demand Protec
tion AaÂ«inÂ»t fire.
SALINAS, Cal., Aug. 6.â An immense
mass-meeting was held in the pavilion to
night. Some 1500 indignant taxpayers at
tended and protested against the action of
tbe City Council In abolishing the Volun
teer Fire Department without providing
other proper precautions against conflagra
tion. This city has been for three weeks
without an organized fire company. Reso
lutions condemning the action of the City
Council were unanimously passed, and
three prominent citizens, W. A. Kearny,
C. F. Lacy and J. R. Hebbron, were ap
pointed a committee with power in the
name of the citizens of Salinas, to rein
state the former fire brigade on its old
footing, and if necessary to take action to
impeach the City Council. Great indigna
tion prevails, as two fires occurred last
evening.2
IMPROVEMENT OF
OAKLAND HARBOR.

AN UNFORTUNATE FIGHT
Millions of Dollars Worth of
Work Retarded by a Local
Dispute.
OTHER IMPORTANT PROJECTS.
Orders Issued in Washington for Coast
Work to Be at Once Pushfd
Forward.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aujr. 6.â Orders
have been issued by the War Depart
ment directing tbe commencement and
continuance of work on waterways on the
Pacific Coast. These orders are the result
of the approval by the Secretary of War
of matters submitted by the engineer offi
cers stationed on the coast for the carry
ing out of river and harbor work in their
respective districts authorized by the last
Congress,
San Franciscans will be interested in
knowing that one of the most important
projects on the coast â that in regard to
the improvement of Oakland barborâ has
not yet Deen started, on account of trouble
between Oakland and Aiameda as to
points where the appropiiation ought to
be spent. Oakland claims money should
be spent at certain points in Oakland,
while Aiameda claims that funds should
be expended in improvement of places
within her jurisdiction.
A. number of complaints have been re
ceived at the War Department in regard
to tbe matter, ana work authorized by
many Congresses has been suspended,
pending a settlement of this controversy
by the Secretary of War.
A number of papers are on file at the
department in regard to the project.
Colonel Mackenzie, acting chief of engi
neers, is now considering them and will
make a brief of tbe whole matter and sub
mit it to the Secretary of War for use in
making continuing contracts to the ex
tent of $660,000. The contracts have been
drawn up and are now before Secretary
Lamont for his consideration. It can be
stated positively that they will not be
entered into until the Oakland-Alameda
controversy has been settled.
Tbe work looking to the improvement of
Wilmington Harbor will not be inaugu
rated until the Santa Monica commission
has submitted its report. Should the
commission make a report in favor of Sau
Pedro Harbor no work will be done on trie
Wilmington project. The total amount
available for the Wilmington Harbor, in
cluding the amount expended from former
appropriations, is $52,457.
Besides Wilmington Harbor, Major C. E.
L. B. Davis of the Engineer Corps has
charge of three matters where improve
ment is authorized in the recent river and
harbor law, namely: San Diego Harbor,
San Luis Obispo Harbor and Napa River.
For the improvement of San Diego Har
bor, Congress authorized an expenditure
of $144,000, to be immediately available.
The project for this work has been ap
proved. In addition to this sum, $27,621
is available from last year's appropriation,
making a total of $171,621 at the disposal
of Major Davis for work at this place.
For continuing work on San Luis Obispo
Harbor, $61,842 is available, $40,000 of which
was appropriated at the last session.
Major Davis has at his disposal $4302 to
spend for the improvement of Napa River.
Of this amount $4000 is made available by
a recent law. The projects for San Luis
and Napa River have both been approved
and instructions have been issued direct
ing prosecution of the work.
Under the general supervision of Colonel
C. E. Gillette of the Engineer Corps three
Californian improvements are to be
pushed to completion. This officer has
available from former appropriations
$122,368 for the improvement of Sacra
mento and Feather rivers. The project
JiÂ« submitted for the improvement of
Humboldt River, for which $225,000 was
appropriated by the last Congress, has
been approved by the Secretary and neces
sary instructions for pushing it have been
issued. Colonel Gillette also has at his
disposal $75,199 for the improvement of
Ban Joaquin barbor and bay, $57,750 of
which was appropriated at the session just
closed. This work will also be hurried.
Considerable work is to be done on the
waterways and harbors of the States of
Washington and Oregon. Projects have
been received and approved on several
waterways and harbors in the States
named and orders have been issued look
ing to their prosecution. The amount
available is placed opposite the name of
each project:
State of Washingtonâ Cowlitz River,
$3000 appropriated, $3423 available; Che
halis River, $3000 appropriated and avail
able; Upper Columbia and Snake rivers,
$5000 appropriated and $7476 64 available;
Wallapo River and harbor, $5552 available;
Olympia Harbor, $32,000 appropriated and
$32,423 available; waterway between Puget
Sound and Lake Union, $20,000 appropri
ated and .$170,000 available; Snohomish
River (Everett Harbor), $20,137 available;
Puget Sound and tributary waters, $75,000
appropriated and $80,509 available. The
river and harbor law contains a provi
sion appropriating $20,000 for the improve
ment of Grays .Harbor and entrance, and
authorizes tbe Secretary of War to make
continuing contracts, aggregating $1,000,
--000. It is understood that the Secretary
will not direct the expenditure of the
$20,000 appropriated until the contracts
have been entered into.
For the State of Oregon improvements
have been ordered at these places: Mouth
of Columbia River, $70,881 available; Co
lumbia River at Cascades, $70,000 appro
priated and $231,347 available; Columbia
River at Three-mile Rapid?, $150,000 ap
propriated and $244,780 available; Colum
bia and lower Willamette River, below
Portland, $100,000 appropriated and $104,
--184 available; Willamette River, above
Portland, and Yamhill River, $40,957
available ($160,000 continuing contracts
authorized) ; Coquille River, $20,000 ap
propriated and $22,000 available; entrance
to Coos Bay and harbor, $95,000 appropri
ated and $95,891 available; Siuslaw River,
$27,000 appropriated and $27,833 available;
Yamuna Bay, $25,000 appropriated and.
|26,341 available ($1,000,000 continuing con
tracts authorized); Tillamook Bay, $17,
--000 appropriated and $18,802 available.
It is understood that tbe Secretary will
defer making the continuing contracts as
long as possible, as he does not wish to
make too great an onslaught on the treas
ury within the time tbat this administra
tion could be held responsible for any
great decrease in the amount of money in
the treasury.
FALSE MODESTY OF BOSTONIANS.
A Work of Art Raises a Commotion in
"Beantotvn."
BOSTON. Mass., Aug. 6.â The nude
bronze statue of a Bacchante, or priestess
of Bacchus, the work ot Frederick Mac-
Monnies, the famous sculptor, destined as
a gift to the Boston Public Library by the
architect, Charles F. McKim, arrived in
New York last week from Paris, and is
now stored in the offices of McKim, Meade
& White.
No sooner did this work of art reach tbe
American shores than a wail of Puritani
cal modesty went up in "Beantown," and
Miss Bluestocking covered her eyes and
declared that she would not accept such
an immodest gift.
The figure is about life size, and ret>re
sents a girl laughing, as she trips along, at
a baby who sits in the fold of her left arm
and reaches down toward a bunch of
grapes which she is dangling above the
child. It was first -exhibited at Paris, and
was so much admired that the French
Government, unable to purchase tbe
original, ordered a replica to be made for
the galleries of the Luxembourg.
OCEAN STORES DELIVERED.
Arms and Ammunition From Seu> SorJc
bafely Landed.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 6.-Dr. Jac
quin de Castillo, sub-delej:ate of the
Cuban Junta, yesterday received a letter
from Major Thomas Garzon of the Cuban
army, in which it was stated that the car
goes of arms and ammunition recently
sent out to Cuba from New York had been
safely conveyed into the interior. Major
Garzon said that after the war material
was landed he was placed in command of
a force of 250 men detailed to guard it.
A march to Puerto Priacipe province of
150 miles was made before a Spanish sol
dier was encountered. Then a force of
2000 Spanish soldiers attempted to seize
the arms, but were repulsed. The troops
engaged in a three days' fight The Span
iards had sixty killed and wounded and
the Cubans two killed and eleven wounded.
The arms and ammunition were finally
delivered to General Diaz, near the city of
Managua.
CHANGES IN THE ARMY,
Colonel C. G. Sawtelle to Re Pro
moted to Quartermaster-
General.
Scramble of Civilians to Secure Po
sitions in the Paymaster's
Department.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 6.â An offi
cial of the War Department stated to-day
that Secretary Lamont had selected tbe
officer who would be the next quartermas
ter-general. That officer he declared would
be Colonel C. G. Sawtelle, chief quarter
master of the Department of the East.
The announcement of Colonel Sawtelle' s
assignment is not expected until next
week. Then, it is understood, the Secre
tary will announce the appointment of two
officers to the commissary of subsistence
corps, an officer (o the quartermaster's de
partment and an officer to the pay depart
ment. At present there are fi ve appoint
ments to be made, and it is the desire of
the Secretary to dispose of them in a
lump. The delay in making the appoint
ment of quartermaster-general is there
fore due to the intention of the authori
ties to await the retirement of Major F. G.
Robinson of the pay department, which
will take place on the 13th inst.
Paymaster-General Stanton. before his
departure for the West, urged Secretary
Lamont to make an appointment to fill
the vacancy to be created by Major Robin
son's retirement at as early a date as pos
sible, as the work of his corps demanded
all the officers that could be obtained.
The pay department is the only one
besides that of the Judge Advocate and
medical department to which a civilian
can, under the law, be appointed. Con
siderable pressure has been brought to
bear upon the President and Secretary ot
War by a number of civilian applicants,
who are desirous of securing this fat army
billet. It can be stated on high authority,
however, that tbe appointment will be
made from the army and not from civil
life. For this vacancy as many as 156 ap
plications have beeu received at the War
Department.
It is expected that three officers, with
the rank of lieutenant, will be assigned to
vacancies existing in the commissary and
quartermaster's departments, and upon
such assignment they will be promoted to
the grade of captain. It is equally impos
sible to state who are the fortunate officers
who will secure these billets.
Secretary Lamont is now considering
two court-martial cases of interest to the
army. One of these is that of Captain C.
G. Ayres, Tenth Cavalry, who is stationed,
with his regiment, at Fort Custer, Mont.
Captain Ayres was tried by a department
court some weeks ago on a charge of using
improper language toward a brother offi
cer, and was sentenced to dismissal.
When his case was received at the de
partment it was reviewed by the judge
ad vocati -general, and by that official was
transmitted to army headquarters, where
it was considered and passed upon by
Major-General Miles. The latter officer
transmitted it to Secretary Lamont's offi
cer and the Secretary is now giving it his
consideration. He will make his recom
mendation on the matter and the case
will be laid before the President, he alone
being empowered to dismiss an officer
or to set aside the sentence of a court
martial such as has passed on Captain
Ayres' case.
The same procedure that has been fol
lowed in Captain Ayres' case has been
fone through with in the caseof Cautain M.
r. Jamar, Fourteenth Infantry, who was
tried on charges growing out of indebted
ness at Vancouver Barracks. Captain
Jamar claimed irresponsibility on the
ground, it is understood, that he was a
victim of the chforal habit. This claim
had little weight apparently, for the court
sentenced him to dismissal, and in their
indorsements tbe judge-advocate-general
and tbe major-general commanding rec
ommend that the sentence be carried out.
Secretary Lamont has as yet taken no
action. It is expected that be will lav
this case and that of Captain Ayres before
the President next week.

CONVENTIONS Of
THE POPULISTS,
There Is a Disposition to
Kick Over Democratic
Traces.
CAN'T STOMACH SEWALL
Fusion in Several States to De
pend on the Maine Man's
Withdrawal.
TOM WATSON KULES IN GEORGIA
The Vice-Presidential Nominee Makes
a Sp:ech in Which Cleve
land Is Scored.
ATLANTA, Ga., Aug. 6.â The Populist
convention was called to order at noon to
day by Hon. Thomas E. Watson, and as he
mounted the platform he was given a great
ovation by delegates and spectators. The
convention assembled in the hall of the
House of Representatives of the State
Capitol and was largely attended. Chair
man Watson made no extended remarks,
as be was reserving his speech for the
rally of Populists, which took place at the
City Tabernacle and at which Watson was
the central figure. The convention ex
pended an hour in temporary organiza
tion and did not get down to business
until shortly before 3 o'clock-
It can be announced positively that
there will be no fusion of the electoral
ticket with the Democrats unless based
upon the withdrawal of Sewall for Vice-
President. The Populists will nominate
a straight electoral ticket and will author
ize the State Executive Committee to
negotiate for a fusion electoral ticket, pro
vided Sewall is withdrawn, but they will
be empowered to enter upon negotiations
upon no other conditions. Bryan and
Watson will be indorsed. It i? Watson's
policy to run a straight electoral ticket in
every State and to insist upon a fight at
every point unless Sewall is withdrawn.
The convention reassembled at 1:30.
Judge James K. Hines was chosen perma
nent chairman. J. L. Sibley of Cobb
County was made permanent secretary.
Judge Hines spoke briefly, declaring that
the Populists were to-day masters of the
situation and that their principles would
triumph unless they were very foolish, and
begging the convention to put out a full
electoral ticket for Bryan and Watson. It
would not do to countenance Sewall, the
Democratic nominee for Vice-President.
"If we propose," he concluded, "to fight
the National banks and great trusts, we
cannot taice a man who is identified with
both."
Numerous resolutions were introduced
and referred without debate to the com
mittee bn platform. Several of these de
manded the withdrawal of Sewall. The
committee on platform retired and then
the convention proceeded to the election
of a full electoral ticket, of which ez-Con
gres-sman W. H. Felton was placed at the
head.
At 4 o'clock the convention adjourned
until to-morrow at 10 a. m.
The Prohibitionists demand an unquali
fied plank on the prohibition question and
there is a very strong sentiment in the
committee against it. The most interest
ing development of the day was the dis
covery of the disqualification of Rev. J. B.
Gambrell as a candidate for Governor, be
cause he had not resided long enough in
the State.
It is now certain that the convention
will nominate either Judge Hines or W.
L. Peek for Governor to-morrow. Peek
was nominated four years ago by the paity
and Hines two years ago. The indications
to-night are that Peek will be nominated
and that Hines will retire iv bis behalf.
Thomas E. Watson to-nigbt made his
first speech since his nomination for Vice-
President. He bad an audience of 6000 at
the Moody Tabernacle here. The audience
was made up of members of all parties,
but they were mostly third partyites.
Mr. Watson began by asking that there
be no display of partisanship during the
proceedings. There has never been known
since 1860, he said, such a political up
heaval as at present confronts the coun
try. What caused it? Some say that it is
a demand for the free coinage of silver.
That is partly true, but there are other
things. This country is in revolt against
Grover Clevelandism, which is the twin
brother of John Sbermanism. The people
of the South, who have so long been
trained to one opinion, have broken their
party ties. They are now thinking for
themselves, their heads having ceased to
be mere hatpegs. Our concern for free
silver is not our only grievance.
"We indict the Government of the
United States because It has dealt badly
with the people. [Applause.] This Gov
ernment has been administered in the in
terest of the rich against those of the
poor; ot the dollar against the man.
Powers that have belonged to the sover
eign have been given to a privileged class.
The National banks have been given the
power to expand and contract the cur
rency. We do not fight the National
banker as an individual, but the system.
We demand that the Government shall
take back the power to make money and
exercise it for the benefit of the people.
We complain that the Government doesn't
tax the bondholder and the railroad kings
as it taxes the poor man."
He briefly alluded to the control of rail
roads, but said the people of Georgia had
one example before their eyes of a great
railroad system openly defying the State
constitution.
"We will have to do what Germany,
Austria, Italy and India* had to do to pro
tect themselves from these great corpora
tions. The Populists here made their
appeal. They demanded a fair ballot and
an honest count."
For some time he dwelt on his own per
sonal political history, explaining why he
left the Democratic party and joined the
Populists. He declared that it was for the
purpose ef building up a new party to
which both the Western Republicans and
the Southern Democrats could go.
Reviewing Mr. Cleveland's administra
tion Mr. Watson said the fingers of a mem
ber of the CaDinet, at Mr. Havemeyer's
dictation, wrote the demand of the sugar
trust for protection. He criticized the ad
ministration for the bond issues and for
opposing silver legislation.
In conclusion Mr. Watson stated that
1 the Populists of the South and West would
carry their every vote for Mr. Bryan and
would demand tbat Mr. Sewall's should
come down.
At the conclusion of Mr. Watson's speech
there was a long demonstration. When It
was quieted Seaborn Wright of Rome was
presented, and he made a speech for the
purpose of capturing the nomination to
morrow for Governor. He is regarded to
night as the sure nominee to-morrow on a
Prohibition platform.
STORMY DEBATES HOLLOW.
Kansas Populists Slow in Indorsing
Hryun and it'atson.
ABILENE, Kaks., Aug. 6.â The Popu
list State Convention opened this morning
by the committee on resolutions submit
ting a platform indorsing the National
Populist code of principles. The commit
tee neglected to mention the Populist
nominees for President and Vice-Presi
dent and a stormy debate followed. Amid
much confusion the names of Bryan and
Watson were injected into the resolutions.
Judge Frank Doster of Marion County
was nominated for Chief Justice on the
firsj; ballot.
When tbe convention met for the after-^
noon session the right of the middle-of-the
road men was again precipitated by the
report of the conference committee. A
discussion of more than an hour ter
minated by the adoption of the report and
the nomination of the electors named by
tbe Democratic contention at Hutchin
son Tuesday.
Delegates representing the Coal-miners'
Union objected to Morris Cliggiit of Pitts
burg, whose name heads the electoral
ticket. The State Central Committee was
instructed to investigate the charges
against him and if it was found to be true
it was authorized to remove Cliggitt from
the ticket and fill the vacancy with an ac
ceptable candidate. For Congressman at
large Rev. J. I. Bobkin, a Methodist
preacher and lately a member of the Pro
hibition party, was nominated by a vote of
343 to 242.
Other nominations of State officers were
made as follows: Lieutenant-Governor,
A. M. Harvey of Topeka; Attorney-Gen
eral, L. C. Bople. Fort Scott; Secretary of
State, W. E. Bush, Mankato.
A great deal of enthusiasm was aroused
by the receipt of a message from Hutchin
son announcing the adoption of the con
ference report
POPULISTS OF TEXAS.
After Hours of Wrangling the Platform
Is Adopted.
GALVESTON, Tex., Aug. 6.â The Pop
ulist convention, after three hours'
wrangling over the report of the commit
tee on order of business, at 11 o'clock last
night adjourned until 8 a. m. to-day.
The datform demands a change in the
administration of Texas; denounces it as
extravagant, outrageous and committed
to nepotism. It refers to the Daying of a
fee to ex-Governor Hogg in the Corbett-
Fitzsimmons prizefight case and condemns
the refusal of the present State adminis
tration to buy Donds, except through "fa
vorites." The platform proper declares
that no alien ownership of land be al
lowed in Texas and that corpora
tions shall not be aliowed to own
more land than they actually use in
the prosecution of their business.
It favors a law making it a misde
meanor for any railroad to give free trans
portation to any State, county or munici
pal official, or for any such official to re
ceive such transportation.
It calls for a red istric ting of the judicial
and representative districts of the State
for the purpose of reducing them ruate
riaily." it condemns the placin 'of raw
materials on the free list. The Populist
party is declared not to be the enemy of
rai'roads, but while advocating the Gov
ernmental ownership are entitled to fair
and impartial treatment.
The only reference to the St. Lonis con
vention Is as follows: "We indorse the
principles of the People's party as set
forth in our National platform at St.
Louis, July 22, 1896."
This morning's session was called to
order at 8 o'clock. Permanent Chairman
Bentley occupied the chair. After the
adoption of the report of the committee
on credentials the platform was read. An
amendment to tne platform favoring the
improvement of Texas harbors and water
ways was read and carried.
The convention got into a snarl over an
amendment to the platform limiting the
salary of any State or county official to
$2000 per year. _
WEEKS FOR GUVERNON.
Florida Populists Aatne a Ticket and
Favor Setc nil's Withdrawal.
OCALA, Fla., Aug. 6.â The Populists,
after nominating a full State ticket, headed
by A. W. Weeks for Governor, adopted
resolutions favoring Sewall's withdrawal.
They also declared: "In accepting Bryan,
the Democratic nominee, the Populist
party has done all that reason f.nd justice
can demand. We desire a unicn of all re
formers, and a failure by Democrats to
withdraw Sewall or substitute Watson
places the ouus of possible defeat of re
form forces upon the Democratic and not
upon the Populist party.''
The following nominations were also
made : Congressman, First District, J. A.
Williams of Cedar Key ; Second District,
W. B. Peterson of JacKsonville.

THOMAS B. REED
IS RENOMINATED,
To Be Returned to Congress
by the Republicans of
Maine.
MAKES A GOOD SPEECH.
Follies of the Overvaluation of
Silver Are Forcibly
Pointed Out.
TRUE BIMETALLISM DEFINED,
The Records Disprove the Char%e
That Silver Was Stealthily
Demonetized.
PORTLAND, Me., Au<r. 6.â Hon.
Thomas B. Reed was renominated for
Congress to-day by the Republicans of the
First District. Reed has represented
Maine iv Congress for ten consecutive
terms.
Mr. Reed was nominated by acclamation
by a rising vote, and three cheers for Reed
were given, great applause following.
Mr. Reed addressed the convention, an<3
received an ovation. Resolutions were
adopted endorsing the platform and can
didates of the St. Louis convention.
After a few words of a personal char
acter, Mr. Reed said in part:
"We in Maine have got to make up oui
minds on the subject sooner than in any
other State in the Union, and our verdid
will be of greater importance to the coun
try. It is worth while then that we
should discuss to some slight extent the
great principles which underlie the issues
of this campaign. Do not understand
that I purpose to make the currency ques
tion perfectly clear to you. I don't know
how it is possible for us all at once to con
tend with the various degrees of ignor
ance which exist. I don't use the word
ignorance in any haughty or superioi
fashion. I mean by it lack of information,
"In the first place I think We ought to
remove certain elements of passion and
feeling that have been connected with
this debate. I suppose that if I have lis
tened once I have a hundred times to the
declaration in Congress that silver money
was stealthily demonetized. Well now,
I, myself, in the House of Representatives,
produced the volume of the Congressional
Record which contained the debates of the
change in 1873 and there were 196 columns
made up of speeches that were actually
made on the subject, and yet they say it
was done in a corner. They have declared
that it was done by an emissary from
abroad, and they even went to the extent
of giving the name of Ernest Soyd. Er
nest Soyd was always a silver man and
was not here when the thing was done.
"At the very outset I want you to un
derstand precisely what is proposed. You
will hear a great deal of talk about bi
metallism. The system which is proposed
by the Chicago Convention is not bimetal
lism. Bimetallism is an entirely different
affair. The object of bimetallism is to
give to the currency greater stability by
spreading it over a surface.
"Real bimetallism has never yet had a
perfect trial. I mean international bi
metallism, and tbat is the kind we must
have, because if this is a disease at all it is
a world disease and has got to have a
world remedy. Nothing else wiil attend
to it. Why, we had some experience in
this country, but men's memories are
short. In 1782 our earlier fathers decided
to marry the two metals.
"What was the first thing they did' It
was to ascertain the market value of the
two metals, and as they stood side by side
then, and they thought they were 15 to 1,
not 16 to 1, but 15 to 1. What was the
effect? It was an overvaluation of silver.
Yes, the gold in a gold dollar was worth
more than the silver in a silver dollarT I
have misstated that. I should have said
that gold was more valuable â so that we
had silver alone during that period. The
gold fled away. Well, now, the gold dis
appearing, our fathers, in 1834, thought
they had better make a change and see if
they could not keep gold and silver to
gether; so they changed the ratio from 15
to 1 to 16 to 1, or, to be exact, to 15.98 to 1.
That turned out to be an overvaluation to
the other way, and what was the result?
The result was that gold reigned supreme.
"Then in 1861 we had a war and we
issued greenbacks, and greenbacks being
cheaper for seventeen years drove out
both gold and silver, but in 1879 we re
sumed specie payments, and the result
was that we resumed them as we agreed
to do in 1873, upon a gold basis. And
that has been the case ever piece.
"This then is the experience of the
United States encountering single handed
the question of currency. We never were
able, when there was a difference of 2 or
3 per cent, to keep the one metal along
side the other. It was always either gold
or silver; never both. Now, if the United
States could not lift a silver dollar that
was worth only 2 cents less than the gold
dollar, can she now lift a 50-cent dollar to
the height of a hundred cents? And if
she can, why should we want to do it?
"Let me take some of the examples
which they give you; but before 1 take
them I will take some that they don't give
you. They talk about wheat and cotton
and state tbat the prices of both these ar
ticles have gone down on account of the
HM in the value of gold. Well, now, the
very same set of figures, the very same
method of figuring by taking all the other
articles which the farmer produces shows
that all the rest of their products have
gone up from 2 to 4 per cent. And it is
perfectly natural that they should because
this is a world which every year consumes
more of certain kinds of farm produce.
Men will have bread and meat ana they
will have the produce of the farmer, the
vegetables and the canners bring them
within the reach of everybody at all times,
and it is natural that there should be a
rise.
"But they say wheat and cotton have
gone down. Tboseare the greatest staples
which the farmer raises. My friends,
everybody in this world, including the
farmer, is liable to have something in
jurious happen to his business, somebody
else goes into it, and when a good many
bodies go into it there is not enough for
all hands in the way of proht. That is the
history of every occupation on the face of
the earth.
"As to the conditions in the price of
farm products, wheat or cotton or any
Hon. T. B. Reed, Renominated for Congress.
other, they naopen from a thousand
things outside of the measure of gold and
silver. Credit plays a great part in this
question oi silver. If your merchants buy
goods from England you will find tbat
credit amounts to a great deal and
on a silver basis we will pay a big sum for
this credit That's why the merchant
does not want a silver basis. They say on
a silver basis you'll scale down your debt
one-half. Would you do it and deprive
the man you owe of one-half of what you
owe him? Shall the Nation do it? I say
no. We must preserve our credit in the
world, and if we adopt a silver basis we'll
ruin it the world over.
"This country has weathered many a
storm. This question is not going to be
decided by noise or loud-voiced eloquence,
or by appeal to prejudice or to greed, but
by the sound sense of the honest, high
thinking, successful country, the wisdom
of a straightforward and manly people."

ONE DAY'S WONDERFUL RACING
Eleven Heats Decided That Average
Faster Than Ever Before on
One Day.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 6.â The free
for-all pace, for which Robert J, Frank
Agan and Rubinstein were entered, drew
an immense crowd to the Columbus Driv
ing Park this afternoon. The weather and
track were such as to lead to the expecta
tion that some record-breaking would be
seen. On the whole the result was all
that could be wished, though the fine ex
hibition of racing was a general one, with
no particular bursts of speed. In all eleven
heats were shown, and the average speed
for them all was about 2:07KÂ» Never be
fore were eleven heats paced and trotted
consecutively in such fast time.
A world's record was broken during the
afternoon. Robert paced the fourth and
decid ing heat of the free-for-all event for
side wheelers in 2:02%, which is the fastest
fourth heat ever paced. The quarters of
this heat were as follows: :30>Â£, 1:01%,
1:31 and 2:02%. The last half of the third
heat of this race was paced by Robert J in
l:00}Â£, or at a 2:01 gait.
In the first heat of the 2:16 pace, Buford
caught his feet in his hobbles as he was
going to the start and fell backward. The
sulky was smashed and his driver (Han
son) narrowly escaped. The race was held
while the horse was sent to the stable for
examination and a new sulky. Horse and
driver entered the race, coming in second
in the first heat, which is considered re
markable in view of the bad fall.
The four heats of the free for all were the
fastest four consecutive heats ever paced.
The time of Robert J in the last heat is
within a quarter second of the fastest race
record. Summaries:

citizens, who showed them every courtesy
and what could be done in the way of ag

Ravenna, Seward, York, Aurora, Nebraska
City and Red Oak bands were out and
ladies served refreshments. At York the
Modern Woodmen of America were hold
ing a conclave, and they acted as escorts
for the travelers through the city. The
exhibit of home products at Seward was
the most extensive seen, the phenomenal
growths of this most wonderful State be

the day with grains, fruits and vegetables
and aroused much enthusiasm en route.
It was the first intention to return to Chi
caeo Friday morning, but, that the train
should pass through Illinois by daylight,
a change was made to that effect. The
party will reach Chicago Friday afternoon.

claims the Coming
Event
EXCELLENT ENTRY LISTS
The Best Racehorses in Cali
fornia Are Scheduled to
Contest
EASTERN SPORTSMEN COMING.
Pavilion Exhibits So Numerous That
Space Is Even Now at a
Premium.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 6. â The
entry lists for State fair stakes that have
already closed are very large, and are so
encouraging to Secretary Smith that he
prophesies the greatest fair held in the
history of California.
There will be a particularly attractive
programme in the thoroughbred depart
ment this year, and already so many
owners have entered first-class animals
that the State Agricultural Society has
decided to give no races for aged horses at
less than six furlongs. This is a move in
the right direction and one that all true
lovers of the thoroughbred will appre
ciate.
As Secretary Smith says, "there is no
room for the sprinters," and the quicker
owners realize this the better it will be for
the sport of kings.
Galen Brown, owner of the great Liber
tine and other crack racers, will arrive at
the fair grounds in about ten- days, and so
many others have applied for stable- room
as to make it certain that fully 500 horses
will be quartered at the track by Septem
ber 1.
Space in the pavilion is already at a pre
mium, and as the time for the fair draws
near prospective exhibitors seem to grow
more numerous.
Following are the racing entry lists that
have so far closed :

MARINVILLE NOTES.
Reducing the Cott of Lighting thn City.
Political Activity.
MARYS VILLE, Cal., Ayg. 6.â The City
Council has done a good thing in getting
the electric lighting cheaper. Hereafter
the lights will go out at 1 o'clock in the
morning. It is estimated that over $1000
a year will be saved by this plan. The
Marysville Appeal says in regard to this:
"It is pleasing to the citizens of Marys
ville to know that they have an adminis
tration which effects reforms and savings
when they set out to do it and who, while
considering the rights of the corporations
supplying the city with commodities in a
temperate manner, still refuse to be bull
dozed or cajoled from a position taken in
the interest of those who pay the taxes."
There is a great deal of political talk
here. Colonel Forbes is mentioned for
the judicial bench and A. C. Forbes for
Supervisor.
Attorney Richard Belcher, who has been
down to San Francisco on an important
business matter, has returned.
The County Clerk's office has issued
seven marriage licenses during July.
TACOMA MAYORALTY DECISION.
Angelo V. Fawctt Must Step Down for
Edward S. Orr.
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 6.â Late this
afternoon Judge Pritchard handed down a
decision in the Mayoralty contest of Ed
ward S. Orr against Angelo V. Fawcett,
declaring Orr elected by a majority of fif
teen. At the last spring election Fawcett
was declared elected by a majority of two
by the canvassing board, and assumed
possession of the office. He was the can
didate of the fusion Democrats and Popu
lists.
Orr will take his seat as Mayor as soon
as the judgment in the case is signed, un
less appeal proceedings and the hling of a
supersedeas bond intervenes. To head this
off it is rumored that the Orr forces will
make a descent on the City Hall and try
to capture the city government by force.
Orr was the previous Mayor and trouble
was narrowly averted when Fawcett in
sisted on taking the office. Orr at first re
sisted, then yielded.
It was in the trial of the contest case
that it was discovered ballots from
four precincts giving majorities for Orr
had been stolen from the vault in the City
Hall. The court ordered the other ballots
recounted and accepted the figures from
the returns for the missing ballots. Un
disputed ballots on recount gave Orr 2620
and Fawcett 2590 votes, including the
stolen precincts. The four disputed votes
counted for Orr gave him 2624 and the
nineteen disputed votes counted for Faw
cett gave him a total of 2609.
PETALUMA'S POOR JUDGES
They Make Mistakes in Placing
Winners at the Fair
Grounds,
George Washington Won Two Heats,
and Perhaps Three, and Was
Awarded but One.
PETALTJMA, Cal., Aug. 6.â The third
day of the race meet saw the largest crowd
of the week in attendance at the track.
The special train from Santa Rosa brought
many visitors, and when the bell called
the horses for the first event the grand
stand was well filled. A five-furlong dash
for the runners and three trotting events
were down for a decision. The betting as
sumes a more healthy aspect as the meet
ing progresses ana neither the auction
box nor the one layer of odds had any op
portunity for recreation to-day.
The 2:15 trot, with Jasper Ayere, Home
ward, Galette, George Washington and
Gbico as contestants, was the main feature
of the card, but laxity on the part of tne
judges caused the race to remain unde
cided as nightfall came. When the judges
announced a postponement until 1 o'clock
to-morrow George Washington, a rank
outsider, Galette and the favorite, Jasper
Ayres, were each credited with a heat.
Obscured ocular vision on the part of
the judges deprived Georee Washington
of having two heats to his credit, for after
clearly beating Gallette out a long head in
tne stubbornly contested second heat, the
judges gave the verdict in favor of Driver
Hodges' mare. There was considerable
adverse comment in consequence. The
officials again decided against George in
the third neat.
Trotting without a skip or a bobble, he
was beaten a bunch of whiskers by Jasper
Ayres after the latter had made one or
two very advantageous skips, which many
thought should have deprived him of the
heat. Sympathy for the outsider perhaps
had much to do with this.
John Robbins' filly, Hallelujah, took the
running event and Nutwood Wilkes, ex
cellently handled by Colored Driver Cecil,
put oil in the can in the 2:19 trot, the
chesnut Wilkes horse placing that affair
to his credit in straight heats.
Nine sprinters lined up in the opening
five-furlong spin. Howard, with Ames
up, was made a 4 to 5 choice, but could do
no better than to second Hallelujah, who
was backed down from fours to 2 to 1 and
won handily in 1:05. Imp. Ivy was a good
third.
In conformity with the trotting associa
tion rules BUlie Button and Digitalis in
dulged in a match race to get a work. The
first named took the opening heat in
2:32)4 and Digitalis the next in 2:25)Â£.
BUlie Button was then withdrawn.
Nutwood Wilkes was a strong favorite
for the 2:19 trot, bringing $10 in the pools
against $7 for the entire field. Without
even being extended to any great extent
he reeled off three heats in 2 :16)4, 2:18^
and 2:18, which lowers his former mark of
2:l9J^. Mammie Griffin, driven by Jimmy
Sullivan, took second money.
The opening poolÃ, sold on the 2:15 trot,
saw Jasper Ayres a pronounced favorite,
he selling for $15 against $5 for the field
and $4 for Homeward.
After a little preliminary scoring Mc-
Nair sent the field away to a nice start.
Homeward went in the air at the first
turn, and George Washington on the pole
led throughout, passing the wire a short
length before Homeward, who trotted a
splendid mile after being steadied. The
winner was alO to 1 shot in the book for
the heat. There was no noticeable change
in the betting, Jasper Ayres, who finished
a good [hire*., still being a hot favorite.
George Washington, going like a piece of
machinery, took the second heat, bu t the
judges saw it differently and placed Gal
letie first. After Jasper Ayres had beaten
Washington out in the last heat by a very
narrow margin the judges announced a
postponement until 1 o'clock to-morrow.

fused to accept the terms offered, as the
season practically closed this evening.
The nver is filled with salmon, but the
quality is poor, because it is so late that
they ail are just about ready to spawn.
ARRANGING FOR
STOCKTON'S FAIR,
Six Days Racing and Pa
vilion Exhibition for
Two Weeks.
PROPOSED BENCH SHOW.
Sharp Competition Among Pool-
Sellers for the Track
Privilege,
MEETINGS TO RAISE FUNDS.
Interesting Features for the Speed
Programme and Good Purses
for the Winners.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 6.â The board
of directors of the San Joaquin Valley
Agricultural Association met this after
noon for the purpose of arranging for the
coming fair, including six days racine at
the track and two weeks exhibition in the
pavilion. It was decided to hold the pro
posed bench show during fair week, and
every accommodation will be given those
who enter their dogs here. The local
kennel club has arranged to raise a guar
antee fond, so that the association cannot
lose any money by holding the bench
show here, and the directors were all in
favor of holding it.
Some controversy arose to-day with
reference to letting the privileges for sell
ing pools. Heretofore Killip & Co. have
been the successful bidders, but this year
B. Levy, the local auctioneer, is making a
strong bid for the privilege, and there is
every prospect of sharp competition be
tween him and Killip & Co. Some of the
directors favor the last-named firm on ac
count of their experience in pool-selling,
while others favor the local man, who has
had some experience in the Northwest in
selling pools.
It was decided this afternoon to hold
the exhiDit in the pavilion, an usual, in
spite of the loss entailed last year, and it
was decided to pay the premiums offered
this year in spite of everything, even if the
interest on the debt of the Agricultural
Association has to go unpaid.
There will be a meeting of the life mem
bers of the association some time this
month in order to get them to assist in
providing for the pavilion display.
The programme at the track is an as
sured success. Already a number of en
tries have been received for the events,
which closed on August 1. No entries
were received for the district trot, and so
the time for entering was continued until
September 1. It was decided to add to the
speed programme by incorporating a two
mile race for butchers' horses which have
not a record inside of 2:35. A good purse
will be given to the winner, the second
horse only to save entrance money.
Secretary Doau will be sent to Sacra
mento during the State Fair to secure
those exhibits that are at Sacramento for
the display here.
RUSY M ATI VE SONS.
Working Xifte Heavers for the Admlsiion
Day Carnival,
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 6.â The decora
tion committee of the Native Sons are up
to their eyes in business just now. Be
tween the San Francisco decorators and
the local men who want the contract to
furnish all the flags, bunting, lanterns and
the paraphernalia to be used in beautify
ing the. Courthouse, the pavilion and the
streets during the Admission day cele
bration they do not know "whether they
are afoot or on horseback."
It is very probable that the contract for
decorating the Courthouse will be given
to outsiders. The excuse made by the
chairman of the committee this forenoon
for not patronizing home people was that
he could do much Detter, as to price, with
those who already had on hand a supply
of bunting, flags and lanterns, which, he
declared, none of the local men had.
One firm proposes to place standards
about the Courthouse square and have
strins of lanterns run up to the top of the
building and some to the very top of the
Courthouse dome. Besides these, long
strings of Japanese lanterns are to be
strung along the principal thoroughfares
of the city. Many thousands of lamps will
be required, and the firm that makes the
proposal offers to keep them in repair and
lit during the evenings on which the cele
bration is to be held. They ask for some
sort of police power in order that they may
arrest any who attempt to destroy the
ianterns.
To-night the Native Sons' committee
met to discuss the plans for the three days'
celebration here. There will probably be
another moonlight picnic at the grove
some night during the month to raise
money for the water carnival fund.
STOCKTON'S ODD VISITOR.
Mr*. Childa, a Colored Evangelist, Drop*
Into the Slough. City.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 6.â An eccentric
character dropped, or rather walked, into
Stockton last Monday. She is Mrs. Childs,
a colored evangelist, and she has, during
the last four years, traveled all over the
United States afoot. Sue believes that she
is doing the Lord's work. Fatigued and
footweary, she arrived in Stockton and
went to the home of another colored lady,
Mrs. Davis, on Anderson street, between
San Joaquin and Hunter streets, where she
remained until this morning, when, bright
and early, she started out, hsaded for Los
Angeles. The traveler is close to 70 years
old and she never wears a hat. The front
part of her head is bald, bat she has a
good bunch of hair on the back part. She
carried a bundle on the top of her head,
balancing it apparently without any
trouble, an accomplishment which she
acquired years ago when she was a slave.
She also carried a basket containing food
enough to satisfy Her frugal appetite until
she reaches a hamlet or city, when she
will replenish it with whatever donations
people may choose to give her.
Cyclers Fill Stockton Streett.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 6.â The streets
are filled with cyclers to-night, as the Ter
minal City Wheelmen are out in force to
let people know about the watermelon run
that is to take place here next Sunday.
Already the committee in charge of the
affair has assurances that tnere will be
over 1000 wheelmen from all parts of the
State in line on Sunday morning. The
Stockton Road Club and the bicycle an
nex of the Athletic Association will assist
the Terminal Citys in their run on Sun
day and the Capital City Wheelmen are
coming down from Sacramento to take
part in the affair. The parade to-night
was some blocks long, the wheelmen
blowing horns and ringing bells as they
went through the principal thoroughfares
to advertise their watermelon run.

BEFORE THE FEST
AT SANTA CRUZ,
Greatest Activity Prevails
Among the Managing
Committees.
DECORATING STREETS.
San Francisco Naval Reserve
Will Swell the Opening
Procession.
SPECIAL TRAINS OF TURNERS.
An Incident That May Necessitate a
Change in the River Fete
Programme.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Aug. 6.âPermis
sion was thia afternoon received from
Lieutenant-Commander Turner of San
Francisco by Lieutenant Morey for the
Naval Reserve of the Fourth Gun Divi
sion, N. G. C, of this city, to take part in
the Turnfest procession on Saturday
night and to participate in the reception
at the carnival pavilion. Wallace Rey
nolds Post, G. A. R., of this city will also
march in the parade. The local Turn
Verein and the Arion Singing Society will
of course constitute the principal body of
the procession, headed by the Hastings
band. Other fraternal and civis societies
will be represented, as all within the city
have been invited, but the names of those
who will accept have not yet been declared
to the executive committee.
The procession will form at Turn Verein
Hall at 8 o'clock and march to the Union
depot in time to meet the visiting Turners,
who will arrive in a special train at 8:30
o'ciock. The march up Pacific avenue to
the lower plaza and Teturn to the pavilion
will be illuminated with 400 Japanese lan
terns and 400 Roman candles. It will be
a grand march of welcome and a glorious
inauguration of the grand celebration that
is to occupy the city and delight the
citizens for four nights and days in a way
that the Germans understand so thor
oughly.
Tfiere may be some disappointment as
to the river fete on Tuesday night, but the
entertainment will proceed, even if it must
be transferred to the bay. When the Car
nival Association concluded its recent at
tractive exhibition it was agreed to permit
the Turnfest promoters to lise the arena
and Queen's throne. Now the owner of
the land on which it stands says the
throne must be removed by the Bth inst.,
or the Turners must pay for it. The
Turners will decide the matter in execu
tive session, but they will not disappoint
the spectators, even it themselves put to
inconvenience.
SANTA CRUZ'S COURTHOUSE.
The New Structure Is Nearly Beady for
Occupancy.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Aug. 6.â The con
struction of the new courthouse has pro
gressed to that point which will enable
the building to be ready for occupancy by
the time the furniture shall be completed
and shipped. The Board of Supervisors,
after several sittings to-day, completed
the estimates and awarded the contracts.
The wood furniture will be furnished by
the C. F. Weber Company of San Fran
cisco, represented at the meetings of the
board by T. M. Humphrey, the vice-presi
dent
The bill will come within $3500, and
while the furnishings will not be extensive
they will be of the best quality and so con
structed that additions may be made at
any time without marring the design or
character of them. Charles Finch of the
Fenton Metallic Manufacturing Company,
Jamestown, N. V., secured the contract for
the metallic furnishings at $1100.
The Board of Supervisors has exhibited
a commendable spirit of economy in the
matter and still has not omitted any neces
sary article of furniture. The 1897 tax levy
for tnis purpose and building construction
has not been exceeded, and the new court
house when completed will be within and
without a credit to the board and an orna
ment to the city, notwithstanding the
many serious delays that have occurred
during tne construction before Thomas
Beck was made supervising architect
SAN DIEGO INTERESTED,
Leading Officials of the New
Japanese Steamship Line

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 6.â President
Eoicniro Asano of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha
Steamship Company, with H. Tamiaka
and H. Okawa, arrived at 1:30 to-day from
Los Angeles, and was met by a large num
ber of representative citizens at the depot.
Mr. Asano and party were accompanied

Japan ; James R. Morse, president of the
American Trading Company of Yoko
hama, and the following committee of
Los Angeles business men who are anxious
that San Diego be chosen as the American
terminus of the new steamship line: Gen
eral Charles Forman, Major E. F. C. Klok
kee, J. R. Newberry, H. Jevne, F. W.
King, 8. B. Lewis, Frank Simpson and
Mayor Rader.
A committee of San Dieco business men
also came down from Los Angeles with
the Japanese, consisting of John C. Fisher,
Collector of the Port; Philip Morse, presi
dent of the Chamber of Commerce ; C. T.
Hinde, representing Spreckels Bros. Com
rny; George H. Ballou, importer of teas;
E. O'Brien, Hotel Brewster, and H. F.
Norcross, representing the Coronado
Beach Company.
The party were taken at once in car
riages to Hotel Del Coronado for lunch
and at 3 o'clock a special train over the
Coronado belt line took them around the
bay and through the orange and lemon
groves, Chula Vista, Bouth San Diego and
other points, arriving in the city earJy in
the evening.
To-night at the Hotel Del Coronado the
Japanese will meet the business men in a
conference relati-g to the terminus of the
steamship line, at which General Manager
Wade of the Southern California road will
aJso be present, besides John D. Spreckels
of Ban Francisco and E. S. Babcock of
Corouado. To-morrow at 8:30 o'clock the
party will be tajjen over the bay in a
steamer furnished by the Spreckels
Brothers Commercial Company.
SECRETARY SMITH REVERSED.
Decision Involving Title to a Large Tract
of Valuable Timber Land in West
ern Washington.
SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. 6.â ln an ac
tion in which General Russell A. Alger,
the Michigan statesman, and R. K. Haw
ley are plaintiffs, L. E. Diller of this city
being defendant, Federal Judge Hanford
to-day rendered a decision reversing Sec
retary of the Interior Hoke Smith, and
giving General Alger and his associate
title to a vast tract of valuable timber land
in Western Washington. The land was
entered under an act providing for the
sale of lands chiefly valuable for timber
and stone. Complainants purchased the
same several years after entry. After an
order of suspension and an investigation,
.Secretary Smith, in a decision in which
he intimated that gross fraud had been
practiced, directed that the entry be can
celed and a patent issued to Defendant
Diller. Judge Hanford, in a written opin
ion, in part, says:
"I hold that the case in the land depart
ment, after entry had been suspended,
should hare been adjudicated by a board
composed of the Attorney-General, Sec
retary of the Interior and Commifisioner-
General of the Land Office, and that the
Secretary of the Interior, without deter
mination of the board, could not lawfully
cancel the entry."
B AN LUIS SMASH-UP.
Freight Train Runs Into an Extra, but
No One Is Injured.
BAN LUIS OBISPO, Cal., Aug. 6.â This
evening on the arrival of the freight from
Santa Maria, on the Pacific Coast Railway,
an extra train of empty cars was standing
on the main track at the depot in this city.
The freight ran into the extra, completely

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 1896.
WOMAN'S RIGHTS
UP AT PORTLAND,
A Wronged Wife Soundly
Whips Her Worthless
Husband.
LIVELY STREET SCENE.
Caused by the Fellow Appropri
ating $200 Ssnt by His
Brother-in-Law
FOR HIS FAMILY'S SUPPORT.
Heartlessness That Was in a Measure
Punished by the Infuriated
Woman.
PORTLAND, Ob., Aug. 6.â An exciting
scene, constituting a footrace between a
man and his wife, attracted several hun
dred spectators to the vicinity of Couch
and Sixth streets this afternoon. The
man was Peter Bromley, well Known in
street-railway circles here, but who has of
late been neglecting his family. On Mon
day last Bromley received a letter from
his wife's brother in St. Louis, inclosing
$200 for his sister. This he proceeded to
spend. Last night Mrs. Bromley learned
of the remittance and its fate, and this
morning started out to square matters
with her recreant spouse. She sighted
him on Burnside street, near Fourth, and
almost at the same moment Bromley's
gaze caught the woman. He at once
broke into a run, she following suit and
screeching to him to stop. Up Burnside
street to Sixth the pair went, the woman,
spurred on by the bitterness of her feel
ings, gaining. Turning into Sixth street
sbe was but a few feet behind, and by the
time Couch street was reached had caught
up with the fleeing man.
Whack! and down came the woman's
umbrella on the fellow's head.
"You wretch (whack), you'll steal my
money, will you?" (Whack.)
At the last blow the umbrella broke
short off, but the maddened woman was
not through, for seizing the cringing
coward by the nape of the neck she pro
ceeded to pummel him in the face with
her clenched fist.
She was at last forced to cease tnrongh
sheer lack of breath, and the man break
ing away made good his escape. Woman
like, Mrs. Bromley sat down on a neigh
boring doorstep and burst into a flood of
tears, which ceasing she told of her hus
band's neglect.
LOSANGELES REFORMERS
Plan for a Lively Campaign in
the Interest of Good
Government
An Independent Ticket, Composed of
Solid Citizens, Will Be Placed
in the Field.
LOS AIfGELES OPFICI Of TH* CALL,)
328 Booth Bsoadway, >
Los Angeles, Cal., Aug. 6. )
The advocates of better municipal gov
ernment are in earnest and to-night they
adopted plans for the approaching cam
paign and determined on an aggressive
right. This means that an independent
ticket will be placed is the field and the
fight made largely on the personal quali
fications of the various candidates. In
deed, political affiliations of candidates
are disregarded by the better- government
promoters, for they exact such a pledge
from the members.
A meeting was held to-night when the
report of the committee on organization
was heard. The name of "League for
Better City Government" was adopted.
The usual provision was made regarding
committees. The primary objects of the
movement is to secure a cheaper adminis
tration of municipal government, and to
adopt a civil service system as far as pos
sible among the city employes. Unless
the league numbers too many members
the candidates will be selected at a general
convention, but should the organization
be too large they will be chosen by dele
gates.
The members of the league residing in
any ward shall constitute a Better Govern
ment Club. An amendment to this section
of the report provided that these clubs
shall suggest the names of the candidates
for Aldermen and members of the Board
of Education, but that all nominations
shall be made by the Central League.
The following officers were elected : Pres
ident, 8. B. Lewis: first vice-president. M.
L. Graff: second vice-president, Octavus
Morgan; third vice-president, Judge A.
M. Stephens; treasurer, M. H. Newmark;
secretary, C. S. Walton. A Central Com
mittee will be appointed on the return of
President Lewis from San Diego.
THE YNDART-CORONEL CASE.
Courtroom Crowded With Lawyers, Wit'
nesses and Spectators.
LOS ANGELEB, Cal., Aug. 6.â Judge
Bhaw's courtroom, where the Yndart-
Coronel case is on trial, has been crowded
all day with lawyers, witnesses and spec
tators in expectation of hearing the sen
eations which this action promises to turn
loose.
Francisco Yndart was called early as a
witness in his own behalf. He is 43 years'
of age, and presented an unconsciously
pathetic appearance. He is a musician of
rare attainments and has a rehned and
delicate temperament.
It had been stated in the com plaint that
he was mentally incompetent, and the de
fense called him for examination as to
that claim. He said he bad been brought
up to have the most implicit confidence in
his uncle, regarding him as a father al
most. The plaintiff bad an unfortunate
marriage, and his uncle advised him to
go to Seattle and eet away from his wife,
which he did. Out of his northern ex
perience arose a feeling against his uncle,
whom, he says, left him to starve when he
was sick. Thereafter, when he reached
home, be brought the first suit against
him, which Jiis uncle afterward persuaded
him to dismiss.
The papers in the divorce suit between
the witness and bis wife were introduced
by Senator White, and the witness identi
fied the verification of the complaint by
himself. In response to questions by the
court it was stated that this line of testi
mony was being introduced to show that
the acts of the witness were those of a
rational person and not those of an in
competent, as had been contended by the
plaintiff. No guardian wae asked for in
the divorce proceedings.
One of the incidents of the trial to-day
was the attempt of the defense to strike
out a deposition by Mrs. Garfias who, it is
claimed, had the alleged trust deed in her
possession for many years, it having been
placed in her care by Francisco's mother
before she aied. The deiense claims that
Mrs. Garfias is in hiding and that the
plaintiff does not dare to produce her, and
that Deputy Sheriff Martin Aguirre has
been endeavoring to find tne old lady, but
as yet without success. The defense has
prepared thoroughly to attack t' c een
uineness of the trust deed and will begin
the introduction of testimony to-morrow
morning.
INCENDIARISM AT GARVANSA.
An Early Morning Fire That Nearly
Swept the Town.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 6.â The sub
urban town of Garvanza, midway between
this city and Pasadena, came near being
wiped out of existence early this forenoon
by fire. As it is, several thousand dollars'
worth of property was consumed in a few
minutes. The circumstances connected
with the tire point strongly to incen
diarmm. Three houses on Emerald street
were totally destroyed. They were two
two-story houses and one cottage, the last
one owned by Robert Veach of this city.
The other houses have been unoccupied
for some time past with the exception of
that of the watchman for the place.
This morning, shortly after 5 o'clock,
flames were seen coming from a room on
the upper story of the house. The alarm
was soon given, and the watchman in the
other house succeeded in saving his effects.
The tire spread rapidly, and soon the
other tw.o-story house and cottage were
afire. There were no facilities at hand
with which to extinguish the flames, and
the residents had to content themselves in
saving the furniture of the cottage. The
lobs on the two buildings is about $5000
and on the cottage probably $8000. So far
as known no one was in the house where
the fire started.
BEN MINOS ACQUITTED.
Detectives fail to Connect Him With the
Hayes Murder.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. Â«.â The
Hawkshaws who had charge of the case
against George and Ben Mings, accused of
the murder of Postmaster Jack Hayes of
Puente in April last, have fallen down
completely. The trial of the elder
brother, Ben, was concluded in Judge
Smith's court here to-day and he was
promptly acquitted. Before the trial be
gan the detectives claimed to have
enough reliable testimony to send half a
dozen men to the State prison.
The verdict was owing to the fact that
the prosecution's witnesses could not pro
duce sufficient evidence to connect Ben
with the murder. Whai lUtle evidence
there was submitted was quickly exploded
by the attorneys for the defendant.
The defense asked to be excused from
making an argument in the case and re
quested the Judge to charge the jury,
whicn he did. In his charge he advised
the jury to find the defendant rot guilty,
from the fact that there was no evidence
against him. The trialof George Mings,
brother of Ben, charged also with murder
ing Hayes, is set for to-morrow morning
at 10 o'clock. It is now said that there is
sufficient evidence to connect George with
the crime.
MERCHANTS PROTEST.
Object to the Proposed Sunday- Closing
Ordinance.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 6.â The fol
lowing somewhat remarkable petition was
filed with the City Clerk yesterday, it
having the signatures of about 500 busi
ness men of this city:
To the Honorable City Council: We, the under
signed merchants of the city of Lot Angeles,
hereby protest earnestly and respectfully
against the proposed ordinance tvbicu will
require us to close our places of business on

mate and we pay to the city a handsome reve
nue for the privilege of conducting the same.
Its pursuit seven days in the week can in no
possible way affect the morality of our citi
zens. The passage of such an ordinance at
this time will result in serious less and injury
to us. It will force many of us out of busi
ness, and the city In common with us will
suffer injury. We protest agaimt such mani
fest injustioe.
In the afternoon the committee on pub
lic morals held a meeting and discussed
the ordinance. Several persons addressed
the committee representing opposite sides
of the controversy. No action was taken
by the committee.
CORONER'S INQUEST.
W. S. Marsh, a Rancher, Accidentally
Shoots Himself.
LOB ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 6.â Coroner
Campbell this morning held an inquest
over the remains of W. 8. Marsh, a
rancher living near La Canyada, this
county, who died yesterday afternoon
from the effects of a buckshot wound acci
dentally inflicted. Marsh was driving

in a cart. He had a double-barreled shot
gun in the bottom of the cart, which was
in some manner discharged. Both loads
struck him in the left shoulder. Marsh
was conveyed to his borne and a physician

TRIED TO WRECK A TRAIN
Miraculous Escape of the East*
bound Passenger Near
Reno, Nev.
Going at Full Speed It Runs Into a
Large Wheel Placed on the
Track.
SUMMIT, Cal., Ang. 6.â Word has been
received here that an attempt was made
this evening to wreck eastbound passenger
train 1 at a lonely siding near Reno, Nev.
A large wheel was placed on the track.
The train struck it while running at full
speed, and it is considered miraculous
that the entire train was not thrown from
the track. The only damage done was
the breaking of an airpipe on the baggage
car. Railroad officials say that the wheel
resembles those used on combined har
vesters and, further, state that wheels of a
like nature are foreign to railroads. Rail
road officers on both tides have been noti
fied, and the matter will be thoroughly
investigated.

LOS ANGELEB, Cal., Aug. 6.â This
city being the home of the two Democratic
aspirants for the Sixth Congressional Dis
trict nomination, who were tied at Ven
tura yesterday, the subject was rife on the
streets here to-day. The feeling between
the two factions of the party, heretofore
anything but amicable, has been fanned
into a white heat over this remarkable up
shoe of the convention.
The adroit coup of the Rose men in se
curing an adjournment, is regarded as
very clever indeed. Pattern's un-Demo
cratic plan of voting for himself is being
complained of severely.
The record as it now stands is favorable
to Rose, who is saying not a word one way
or the other. The claim of the Patton
contingent that the railroad wants to
nominate a dummy to be knocked down
by McLachlan is given little credence by
people who know the frank, candid, out
spoken grape-grower for the past twenty
five years.
In the meantime H. C. Dillon is train

They Are Joining McKinley Clubs in
Large Numbers.
PASADENA, Oal., Aug. 6.â The mem
bership of the Pasadena McKinley Club,
which was formed last week with 130
members, has swelled to 500. At a meet
ing held August 4 rolls were presented
showing signatures of 487 electors pledged
to work and vote for McKinley and Ho
bart, and there are lists yet to be heard
from, so that 500 is a conservative esti
mate of membership.
The colored Republicans of Pasadena
have also organized and a McKinley
marching club has been formed under the
name of the Americus Club, which in
cludes all the younger members of both
organizations.
An enthusiastic meeting of the latter
club was held this evening. Organization
was effected by the election of the follow
ing officers: President, Edwin Steams;
vice-presidents, W. C. Smith and T. A.

The club starts off with a membership
of nearly 100, and double the present
number of names, it is confidently ex
pected, will be enrolled. Handsome and
novel uniforms, the exact character of
which has not been made public but
which will probably be fashioned on
Napoleonic lines, will be adopted. 'This
club will act as an auxiliary to the main
Republican club of Pasadena, and will
always be in the van of the procession
and take an active and conspicuous part
in the campaign.
YOLO COUNTY ACTIVE.

alive. They believe that in organization
lies the most effective strength of a suc
cessful campaign. Before August passes

a club in Woodland, with a membership
of over 160, and the list steadily growing.
This was followed by the organization
of a live club at Black's. Now Guinda
comes to the front. A club was organized
in that village and the following officers

Sonoma County in Line.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Aug. 6.â A Mc-
Kinley and Hobart club was formed to
night at Perms Grove- The meeting was
held in the Eagle Schoolbonse, and the
capacity of the building was taxed to hold
the crowd. The speakers were Duncan E.
McKinlay and Albert G. Burnett, of Santa
Rosa, who are justly counted as Sonoma
County's star orators. The people of
Perms Grove were not backward in their
expressions of approval of the intellectual
treat afforded.
At the conclusion of the speaking a large
number signed the clubroll. Mr. McKin
lay received a telegram from Congressman
McLachlan of Los Angeles asking him to
speak for three weeks in Southern Cali
fornia. It is probable ttat the invitation
will be accepted as soon as Mr. McKinlay 's

ASTORIA DRATIST'S BLUVE.
Made Pretense of Itrowning Himself,
and Nearly Succeeded.
ASTORIA, Ob., Aug. 6.â Dr. Howard, a
prominent dentist of this city, had a dis
agreement to-night with his wife, and as a
result announced his intention of commit
ting suicide by drowning himself. Suiting
the action to the word, the dentist sepa
rated from his better half on one of the
principal streets and hastened in the direc
tion of the water front.
His wife smilingly followed, the husband
waving a good-by to her at frequent inter
vals until he reached the dock. Walking
down a slip until the water reached his
knees he looked around and once more bid
good-by to his wife, who was on the dock
above, smiling broadly and conh'dent that
her husband's threat was only a bluff.
The farewell had just been uttered when
the dentist's feet slipped from under him
and he found himself in thirty feet of
water. He struggled with all his might
to keep afloat, crying lustily for help and
attracting a large crowd of people. He
was hauled out thoroughly soaked, but
completely cured of the idea of seeking a
watery grave.

family, is returning home, after a siege of
serious trouble, from which be was pat to
great expense and loss of time to extri
cate himself.
About a yeai ago Robertson opened a
general merchandise store at Kodiak, and
by reasonable charges and courteous treat
ment of customers made deep inroads into
the Alaska Commercial Company's mo
nopoly of trade there. His prosperity
continued and his business was increasing
until he had most of the monopoly's
trade.
Then a preconcerted plan between the
Commercial people and another merchant
was put into operation for the purpose of
running Robertson out of business. Ha
attended strictly to his own affairs and
was making money while his enemies at
tended to making it disagreeable. He re
fused to shut up shop, however, despite
the persecution, and one day an effort
was made to bounce him out of his own
store by physical force.
Then it was that Robertson lost patience
and taking a big six-shooter from under
the coumei permitted a large quantity of
daylight to pass through the body of the
other merchant, who, unfortunately for
himself, led the attack.
The commercial company's bruisers
fled, and Kobertson was left in peace, un
til United States Deputy Marshal Man
ning, an overzealous officer, without look
ing into the case, arrested him, and char
tering, a special steamer took his prisoner
to Sitka, from where he was taken to San
Francisco for trial.
It took Robertson just fifteen minutes,
by the watch, to prove that he fired in
self-defense while being attacked in his
own house, and while defending his own
life and property from a mob. He was
promptly acquitted, and is now on his way
bacK to KodiaK to resume business.
Manning, from all reports, was over
officious in trying to make a record for
himself. In carrying out that idea he
employed a spotter in the person of a
Japanese to find out where liquor could be
bought. One morning the Jap reported
for duty, or to resign, attired in a warm
coat of tar and feathers. He also had a
note for Mr. Manning, which mildly sug
gested that he should not work so bard
in running down whisky-smugglers if he
wanted to evade being put into a pot of
boiling tar, head first. Since that time it
is said that the clerical portion of Deputy
Marshal Manning's job has occupied his
entire attention, and the traffic in liquors
is on the improve.

THRIVING CITIES

Famous Willamette
Valley.
GREAT WATER POWER.
It Is Now a Manufacturing
and Distributing

FAMOUS FOR ITS FLOUR.
In a Beautiful Location, tbe City's
Growth Has Been Very
Steady.
ALBANY, Or., Aug. 4.â The town of
Albany was one of tbe pioneer settlements
The Magnificent Cantilever Bridge Which Spans the Willamette RiVer at /\lban\j, Oregon.
of ibe Willamette Valley, and from an
early date was a leading shipping point.
The flour manufactured by the Mag
nolia, the Monteith and the Red Crown
flouring-mills has gained a fair name from
Los Angeles to Victoria. And the quan
tities of wheat, oats, wool, butter, eggs,
hay, etc., handled here represent vast
sums of money.
The town is located on the east side of
the Willamette River, eighty miles south
of Portland, on a gently rolling prairie,
and is in the center of the famous Wil
lamette Valley, which is about seventy
five miles wide. The river is navigable
throughout the year, except in the driest
seasons.
There are two lines of the Southern Pa-

cific Railroad Company, the main line of
the Oregon Central and Eastern Railroad,
and surveys have been made for the Al
bany and Astoria Railroad, which will no
doubt be built when railroad construction
is resumed in the United States.
It will be seen that there are three ways
of shipping to San Francisco and two to
Portland, so that Albany will be in future
as in the past a strong competitive point.
As a consequence better prices for grain
and produce can be depended upon than
can be obtained at less favored localities.
The river is spanned at this point by a
beautiful and substantial cantilever
wagon-road bridge of steel, which makes

ton and Nortnern Polk counties tributary
to the city. The country south and east
of Albany is for miles and miles a level
prairie with deep, rich, loam soil, none
better in the worJd. It has enough rise
and fall to provide good drainage and
produce* fruits, vegetables, grains and
grasses in wonderful profusion and per
fection. The holdings of land, formerly
large, are being Droken up into small
tracts.
We are credibly informed that the
j owner of an apple orchard refused $1000
! per acre for his orchard of twenty acres in
i full bearing. Ordinary farming land can
j be bought at very reasonable figures, vary
ing according to location and other con
ditions. .
North and west of the river the land is
more rolling, but none of it steep hills.
The character of the soil is more varied ,
running from a sandy loam to a deep red
clay, but all good farming and fruit land.
The city itself, while it is thus the cen
ter of a farming community fifty miles
across, is not dependent upon the farming
class alone. ,
A canal taps the Santiam River near the
foothills of the Cascade Mountains, and
brings the pure mountain water to the
city for family use and for power. The
latter is distributed along the water front
by flumes and ditches, and turns the
wheels ot Albany's numerous manufac
turing plants. The Calapooia River also
furnishes power, entering the Willamette
River at this point.
There are in the city two fine public
school buildings and a large and weil
equipped college, under the auspices of
the Presbyterian church. The Catholics,
also, maintain a good academy at this
point.
The public schools are thoroughly
graded. Professor Hiram Gyrce, the city
superintendent, is ar>. enthusiast in public
school work and as painstaking as enthus
iastic. The corps of teachers are well
qualified for their positions, I am told ,
and merit and not favoritism is considered
in their appointment. So far as I can
learn party politics cut no figure in ap
pointments.
The college is presided over by Pro
lessor W. H. Lee, who is not only very
popular, but a first-class educator as well.
The courses are very complete aud the
instructors competent. There being a
very small Catholic population, the
Academy of Our Lady is not so well
patronized as the college. The lady
superior is a very pleasant, affable lady,
and the programme of tbe school seems to
go like clockwork.
Albany is the county seat of Linn
County and the Courthouse and County
Jail are substantial brick structures. The
latter is fitted with modern steel cells.
The population of the town is about 5000
and it extends nearly tw.o miles along the
river front.
There are seven hotels, four of them
quite large. Eleven churches accommodate
all shades of religious belief. The paators
as a rule are well educated, brainy, live
men. The two banks are both very sub
stantial institutions, which the late panic
seemed to have no effect upon.
A large tannery is in full operation, and
we have a fruit-drier, planing-mill, brew
ery, soda works, tile factory, four wood
working factories, two chair factories,
large foundry and machine-shop, ice fac
tory, mattress factory, large- brick woolen
mill, three flouring-mills, four elevators
and warehouses, cigar factory, a creamery,
water works and electric-light worts. A
company is being organized to build a
large sawmili â capacity 200,000 feet per
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 1896,
day. The timber is cheap, inexhaustible
and of the best quality. It is obtained
from the Cascade Mountains, on the line
of the Oregon Central and Eastern Rail
road, and consists of Oregon pine, cedar,
hemlock, larch, etc.
An article on Albany would not be com
plete without mention of the Quartzviile
gold mines, forty miles to the east, now
becoming so noted. The ores cover a
large territory, are low grade, but easily
worked, and foreign and home capital are
rapidly developing them. They will be
an important factor in Albany's future,
as this point is the natural distributing
center for that region.
As will be seen by the accompanying
illustrations Albany's business streets are
of well-built brick blocks, two, three and
four stories high. The street railway con
nects tbe business part of town with the
railroad stations. The streets are graded
and graveled, and a fine system of sewer
age is practically completed.
Our 'advantages summed up are: Loca
tion, transportation facilities, water-power,

but not least a healthful location.

GRIEF, REMORSE AND SUICIDE.
Tragic Segue/ to an Illicit Loveâ Elope-
ment, Criminal Operation and Thne
Untimely Deaths.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 6.â William
James Relland, a young railroad mechanic
of Seattle, shot himself through the brain
in the presence of Coroner Campbell this
evening at about 6 o'clock. Grief over the
death of his paramour and fear of a crimi
nal prosecution were the causes of Kel
land's act.
The woman was Mrs. Jennie Snyder,
who had deserted her family for Relland
and come here last month. She died last
Wednesday from the results of a criminal
operation in which RÂ°i!and was concerned.
Mrs. Snyder left Seattle last June with
Relland, bringing her daughter Jennie
along.
They took a cottage in East Los Angeles,
where the tragedy occurred to-day. Mrs.
Snyder discovered that she was about to
become a mother, so the operation was
performed last Friday, she dying yester
day. Relland buried the fcetus in the back
yard. He acquainted the woman's hus
band with her death and asked for money
for the funeral expenses.
Mr. Snyder asked Attorney J. N. Phil
lips to look after the child. The iawyer
told Reliand that he was liable to prose
cution for his part in the operation. Rel
iand took poison this afternoon, but not
enough to kill.
Coroner Campbell visited the place this
afternoon about 4 o'clock to investigate
and discovered the foetus. Relland saw
him and became angry at the officer's
presence. After some words Relland went
into a neighbor's home. There Dr. Camp
bell followed him, after first having or
dered his deputy to notify the police de
tectives to come.
The Coroner talked with Relland in
order to keep him until the officers ar
rived. There was a noise in the yard and
the Coroner looked out of the window in
the hope of seeing the detectives. Tbe in
stant Dr. Campbell turned from him ReJ
land sprang into an adjoining room and,
drawing a revolver, sent a bullet crashing
through his brain, dying almost in
stantly.
An inquest was held to-night on the re
mains of Mrs. Snyder, the jury deciding
that she had come to her death from in
ternal hemorrhages, the result of a punc
ture of uterus from an instrument in the
hands of Dr. A. Shorb, who had been
called to attend the woman on Friday,
when the operation was attempted.
MRS. HICKS-LORD DEAD.
In Her Day She Was One of the Most
Notable Figures in New York
Society.
NEW YORK, N. V. t Aug. 6.â Mrs.
Annette Hicks-Lord, who was in her day
one of the most notable figures in New
York society, died last night, aged 75 years.
Mrs. Hicks-Lord was descended on her
mother's side from a titled English farailv,
and was related to General Robert Schenck,
once United States Minister to Great
Britain. Her father. Unico Peter Wilkins,
married Adeline Schenck, whose family
had a great deal of property on the Fish kill
River. The couple went to Guiana, where
Annette was born.
Forest Fires in Arkansas.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Aug. 6.â Forest
fires of considerable extent are raging
near England, in Lone Oak County, and
in several places the cotton and corn fields
are to,;i y destroyed. Many miles of
fencing - a v<> been reduced to ashes. One
hundred Stau mnvicts were sent to the
scene of the conflagration to-day. These
men will be used in cutting down trees and
otherwise removing destructible timbers.
It is estimated that 200,000 acres of cotton
and corn have already been destroyed.

The State May Produce $20,000,000
in Gold the Coming
Year.
The State Mining Bureau for a number
of years past has been accustomed,
through its agents, to prepare a table of
mines in operation in the State, together
with tbe number of men employed in
each mine. The report for the current
year bas just been completed and affords
the most convincing evidence of the re
vival of the mining industry on a large
scale.
The remarkable activity noted is con
fined to no particular mining section of
the State, but everywhere, whenever a
chance exists that money is to be made
by the extraction of the precious metals,
men are found who are willing to stake
their time, money and labor against the
chances of a rich discovery; mines that
have been abandoned or were, under the
old system of mining, unprofitable, are be
ing drained, retimberea and put in order for
a renewed activity, placers that were
thought to be exhausted are to be worked
again and hydraulic mining, under the
new laws, has returned to life again.
In quartz mining, however, the largest
development is anticipated. Ore can be
reduced so cheaply under present processes
that mines producing low-grade ore are in
active demand owing to the fact that so
much development has usually been ac
complished on these mines that only small
capital is_ required in order to place them
in working order again. The following
'shows the number of miners employed
and registered mines in the ore-producing
counties of the State in the year 1895:

For the year 1896 a most remarkable
change appears. The total number of men
employed itÂ» increased by 9006, or almost
double, while the number of recorded
mines increased in 1896 over that of the
year 1895 by 750. The greatest increase of
tbe men employed is apparently in those
districts where the great producing mines
are located, taough the increase in the
new mines is distributed through the
State.

Louis A. Garnatt, whose experience as a
miner in this State has embraced almost
four decades, regards the present revival
of mining with unmixed satisfaction.
The withdrawal of nearly 10,000 men from
the ranks of the non-producers has al
ready, in his opinion, produced an appre
ciable effect upon the oversupply of labor
in tbe great centers. The demand for
j labor of all kinds at the new mines that
{ are being opened promises to reduce the
surplus greatly, and tbe prospect is en
couraging that between agriculture and
mining there need not be an idle man in
the State in 1897.
The reports from all the mining coun
ties are unanimous in their statement of
better d conditions resulting from the re
vival of mining. The outfitting of pros
pectors has improved the business of the
country towns, enabling the merchants to
liquidate their debts to the jobbers and
order new goods. The jobbers in this City
say that the outfitting demand has saved
the spring's trade.
California produced in 1895 in gold and
silver $15,934,107 39, a moderate advance
over the amount produced in 1894. John
J. Valentine, superintendent of Wells,
Fargo & Co., predicted that 1896 would
show figures approaching $17,500,000, but
now admits that his estimate may be ex
ceeded. With the prospects of new pro
ducing mines and ricn districts, discovered
but undeveloped, and the employment of
10,000 new men in the industry, it is confi
dently believed by many that California's
total for 1896 may reach the magnificent
figure of $20,000,000.

A WOStAJi'S HEROISM.
Climbed Down a Hell and Rescued a
Child.
FULTON, Mo., Aug. 6.â Yesterday the
3-year-old son of Zeke Hopkins, who lives
in West Fulton, fell headforemost into a
forty-foot weii. The mother of the child
saw the baby as he fell and screamed for
assistance. Mrs. Henry Harris, hearing
her cries and grasping the situation, ran to
tbe scene, first grabbing up a long coal pit
rope. Tying the rope around her waist
Mrs. Harris climbed down tbe well, Mrs.
Hopkins holding tast to the other end of
tbe rope. She reached tbe water, some
thirty feet from the top, and diving down
some four feet under the water, drew the
dying child to the surface and to safety.
Slowly Mrs. Hopkins drew her precious
load to the top and after hard work they
brought the little boy to consciousness.
After the danger was passed Mrs. Harris
fainted, but was brought around all right
in a few minutes.
Negroes Xot Citizens.
PERRY, 0. T., Aug. 6.â By a decision
handed down by Judge Adams, Chief Jus
tice of the Supreme Court of the Creek
Nation, the names of over 1700 negroes
are stricken from the rolls of citizenship
of the nation. The decision holds that the
action of the Indian council, after the
passage of the emancipation act by the
United States, in admitting the negroes to
tribal relations was unconstitutional and
therefore at this time invalid. Since the
passage of the act these negroes have
drawn in annuities from the Creek Gov
ernment over a million dollars, have held
positions of trust and have improved their
farms. From the decision of the court
there is no appeal.
THEY DEMAND PURE FOOD
Fruit Exchange Committee Criti
cizes Supervisor Hohbs for
Inconsistency.
It Is Thought an Appropriation Should
Be Had to Establish a Public
Laboratory.
The committee appointed by the San
Francisco Fruit Exchange to attend to the
general subject of the public health, and
particularly to the question of food adul
teration, has brought in a full report.
The report emphasizes the fact that the
importation of adulterated jellies and
jams from the East is a pressing evil, and
states that they were unable to bold a
conference with the Board of Supervisors
to establish a chemical laboratory for tbe
inspection of imported foods. Without
this appropriation the committee reports
that all proceedings might as well be
dropped. The following is the text of the
report :
San Francisco, Aug. 6, 1896.
To the Board of Lin dors of the San Francisco
Fruit ExchangtâJ)EAK Sias: Your committee
appointed to attend to the question of food
adulteration and general subject of public
health, particularly regarding the importation
of adulterated jellies and jams from the East,
begs leave to report as follows:
That this is a most important thing, affect
ing the frui'.-growers, fruit-canners and pack
ers generally throughout tne State.
We attended several meetings at tne Cham
ber of Commerce, in conjunction with com
mittees from all the commercial organizations
in the City, and recommended that the Board
of Supervisors appropriate a sufficient sum to
establish & chemical laboratory and general
food inspection, the same as is the case in tne
large cities of the Kast.
The Board of Health of San Francisco asjted
for $25,000 for an appropriation for the pur
poses named. Part of this was for a perma
nent establishment of a laboratory, where pub
lic certificates of analysis would be issued to
the general public.
Recognizing the necessity of keeping down
the tax levy during this year we figured that
this appropriation desired would not amount
in excess of one-hundredth of 1 cent on the
dollar of taxable property in San Francisco, or
half of 1 cent on each $100 of property. We
endeavored to hold a conference vrith the
Board of Supervisors, but were unable to
do so.
They acknowledged that they did not under
stand tbe requirements, but when they pre
pared to fix the tax levy they refused to have
any one explain the subject. The ridiculous
ness of this whole proposition was thtu some
one of the Finance Committee of the Board ot
Supervisors, notably Mr. Hobba of that com
mittee, objected to the appropriation for
public health in order to keep down the levy,
and reached the height of consistency by
moving to increase the tax levy 5 cents on
the $l(>0 by an additional schoolhouse in the
district in which he lived by an appropriH Uon
of $200,000. This man unquestionably does
not understand that in all civilized communi
ties the question of public health is paramount
to all other subjects, and all other departments
of the City government are in other communi
ties subordinate to that of Public Health.
Your committee finds further that in the
appropriations for the Health Department by
the Supervisors are considered amounts
which properly do not belong to the depart
ment of public health, viz.: Departments
such as the Receiving Hospital, Almshouse,
prisons, etc. These belong properly to the
charity and correction departments, and in
Eaitern cities they are not considered in con
nection with appropriations for the public
health, which department deals exclusively
with the public health of the community.
The entire increase of appropriation for pub
lic health by the Board of Supervisors is the
munificent sum of $2000 over and above the
amounts sufficient to pay expenses and In
spectors already created and paid for during
the past year.
We have investigated this part of it and find
this to be the fact.
Unless the- amount necessary can be appro
priated to go into tbe matter in proper shape
It is ridiculous to make an attempt at it at all.
The San Francisco Fruit Exchange and the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Association of
this City deserve great credit for having un
dertaken the subject in order to put this City
in line of progress with other large commun
ities throughout the country and Europe.
As we have said, the entire appropriation re
quired will be one-hundredtn of 1 cent on each
dollar of taxable property in San Francisco,
and as the tax levy is not yet a fixed fact we
would recommend that a committee be ap
pointed to. demand a conference with the
Board of Supervisors and Board of Health of
San Francisco on this subject so that the facts
of the case may be laid before them.
We can safely say that since this agitation
began on the subject of pure foods tbe falling
off in importation of adulterated jellies from
the East bag been very heavy, and it only re
quires determined action to stamp this adul
terated stuff out of existence in this City and
State.
The press of this City has taken hold of this
subject and realizes its importance.
We further recommand that tbe services of
a competent attorney be secured to prosecute
violations of the pure food laws in the Police
court* without expense to the association.
We find that the ordinary process will not
succeed.
Your committee has been tendered the ser
vices of a competent attorney, who will act for
and on behalf of the exchange without any
expense to it, and will prosecute the cases that
may come up, and we would recommend that
these services bo secured at as early a date as
possible, as several cages are now on the docket
and need attention.
Tne fruit business of this State amount! to
many millions of dollars and the canners of
this State are putting up many millions of dol
lars of canned good*. Before the Eastern
adulterated stuff came in here all the canners
did an enormous business in jellies, which has
gradually drifted away, and the cheap, adul
terated and frequently poisonous stuff from
the East has taken its place. This stuff is sold
for half of the price at which pure fruit jellies
could be sold for.
If the above recommendations are adopted
and your committee succeeds in holding a
conference with' the Board of Supervisors on
this subject, we ieet that they will see the
importance and discover that this question is
of more importance at the present time than
many ot the matters engaging their attention.
The question of public health is paramount
to all other consideration Â», and it is strange
that the Board oi Supervisors, which is com
posed of intelligent m<sn, do not realize this
Without the necessary appropriation by the
Board of Supervisors the matter might as well
be dropped, &s nothing can be accomplished
unless the thing is done with a complete
and thorough organized force to bring about
the reforms so devoutiy desired by every man,
woman and child in the community who has
the public welfare at heart. Bespectf uhy sub
mitted, COHMITTK.

St. Mary's Cathedral was crowded last
evening to hear Rev. P. C. "Vorke's lecture
upon the subject of "What the Catholic
Church Has Done tor Science." The lec
turer held the close attention of his large
audience for almost two hours and cited
many historical incidents to refute the
accusation that the church was opposed to
the progress of scientific knowledge. The
reverend gentleman spoke in substance as
follows :
It has become a kind of superstition that all
religions, and especially the Catholic religion,
are antagonistic to science. If you take up
the newspapers you will see that it is the
duty of the Catholic church to stifle all scien
tific research, especially since tne promulga
tion of the doctrine of infallibility. After this
tne world threw up its hands and said,
"This is the end of learning and the death of
knowledge."
When Christ sent hie apostles forth he did
not teach them the multiplication table nor
instruct them in chemistry but in the doctrine
of faith which he came down from heaven to
give unto mankind.
So the church has her sphere of teaching
apart from the teachings of science, and she
has tenaciously resisted intrusion into her
realms of thought. No one needed to sub
scribe to them but were free to go outside, tut
within she would brook no dogma other
than her own. Yet her teaching has
overflowed into the realm oi scientific matters
and she has become the fostering mother of
that knowledge. It is when the church re
fused to fall down before the secular theories j
that the world said she was opposed to science. !
If v/e find that the Catholic church has been
marching in the van of civilization, that she I
has been the fountainhead ot the learning of
the ages, if we look back from the vantage
ground of history and see her the nursing
mother of science, can we echo the accusation
that she has opposed the advance of knowl- '
edge?
We will find that she has led in educational
research, and she has not been afraid of the
light. When the darkness of Barbarism came I
down in Europe till it seemed that the learn
ing of the time would be quencne'i in the
gloom of an Arctic night, it was the church
that turned the vandal from his work of de
struction. No sooner had the invaders corae j
in contact with the Church of Rome |
than they forgot their ferocity and bowed !
before that which they had attempted to de- I
stroy. Then were their feet planted in the |
path that led to our modern civilization. She,
the Mother Church, like the prophet of
old. gathered up the fire of the altar and hid
it in her garment.
When order had been restored and govern
ment established schools sprang up on all

sides. In the abbeys and monasteries priests
and monks devoted their lives to teaching.
From these sprang the great universities that
are now the pride of all ages. They spread
across Europe, through France and to the
British Isles, and Ireland shone with the glory
of her learning. Italy is and has ever been
the center and cradle of civilization.
The great means of advancine knowledge is
the art of printing. We feel that something
is lost if we do not receive our newspaper. In
this enlightened age the poor have literature
as well as the rich. In the olden time men
prepared the sfcin of animals whereon to
write. They went down to the river and gath
ered the reeds, which they split, and that was
paper. The art of printing came down to us
from Catholic lands.
If the monksâ the "lazy monks"â were so
opposed to learning, then was the time to
smash the printing-press and check the prog
ress of letters. The first book on this continent
was printed in the City of Mexico and was an
explanation of the Catholic doctrine, and the
first newspaper in the world was published In
Venice.
Let me briefly call up more evidences of the
attitude of the Catholic Church toward learn
ing. In the sixth century Ptolemy, the Greek
astronomer in Alexandria, was succeeded by
Cosmos, a Catholic. In the thirteenth century
we find Catholic monks such ns Marco Polo
and others penetrating into the darkness of
Eastern barbarism, carrying the light to the
benighted nations there.
Then we see Columbus commanding: a ship
bearing a cross of the Most Catholic King of
Spain sailing western over an unknown ocean.
This continent was named after another Cath
olic explorer. When people pronounce the
words Columbia and America they utter a
tribute to Catholicism. Other men of the
same faith, followed by the grave Spanish
soldiers, bore the holy cross of their belief to
all parts of the Western Hemisphe-e.
Of course we have all heard of Galileo and
his retraction. He has been held up for ages
as evidence of the church's hostility to
science. Galileo's error was not in spreading
his theory of tne earth's motion around the
sun, but in attempting to prove it in scriptural
argument '
This the church considered as an intrusion
into her own realms and he was called upon
to cease. He refused to do so and was con
fined for a while at Rome in a palace. The
| weird tales of his imprisonment in a dreary
! dungeon and his dread experience there ia!l
! to the ground. Afterward Galileo was triven a
pension by the Catholic church and enjoyed
this gift all his remaining life.
What of Keppler and Tycho Brahe the Protes
taut astronomers of Germany and Denmark
respectively? Because of their theories ou the
same line of those of Galileo they were forced
to flee from their Lutheran countrymen and
take refuge in Catholic < mntries, where they
I were well treated and honored. When you
# hear of Galileo answer by mentioning the
names of Keppler and Tycho Bmhe.
When the Gregorian calendar was estab
lished in Rome, correcting an error in time
rind adopted by Catholic countries, Protestant
England and Germany bitterly opposed it, and
long afterward computed time twelve days be
hind the age.
Two great men died recentlyâ Huxley, the
(agnostic, and Pasteur, the Catholic. The for
mer, with a mind so clear that he could make
others nee as clearly as he, yet knew nothing
of a future state, and thought all men were
matter, to return to the elements.
He died, and we cannot point to anything
he did or discovered to make life easier tor his
fellows. How it was with Pasteur all men can
answer. A man believing in God, in search
ing the works of God will reach the highest
point in the learning of the world.

GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ET.KCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1898.
Beware of side issues.
The main point is prosperity.
McKinley's record is a good platform in
itself.
Protection to industry will give us both
gold and silver.
Some of the wiser Democratic leaders
are already complaining that Bryan talks
without thinking.
If the Democratic organs have their
way this will be a campaign of side issues
from start to finish.
Free-trade Wilson may go to Englaud
this summer if he wishes. America has
no further use for him.
Between the Democrats and the Popu
lists of Alabama the relationship saems to
be strictly one of blood. â¦
In the Democratic and Populist mix-up
it is still a matter of conjecture which is
Jonah and which i? the whale.
We can find no flaw in the character of
McKinley, say the Democrats, but as a
side issue we can caricature Mark Hanna.
Democracy may blame Cleveland for
putting it in a hole, but all the same the
country knows who enacted the Wilson
tariff.
It is announced that Senator Hill had
Chairman Jones to dinner, but it is not
stated tbat he offered him anything more
than soup.
Altgeld has called on Bryan, and it goes
without saying that if he asked anything
the boy orator was too promising a youth
to refuse it.
The funding bill may be an issue in
some States, but as afl parties are opposed
to it in California there is no party poli
tics in it here.
Â« -
Whether it turns out to be Brytn and
Sewall or Bryan and Watson there will be
the same old free-trade, deficit-tariff crowd
behind the combination.
It is reported that Bryan's Chicago ora
tion is to be revised and the plagiarisms
left out, so we may assume it will be cir
culated during the campaign as a small
leaflet.
When tbe Wilson tariff bill was tinder
consideration Senator Gorman was thrown
out of the Democratic bandwagon aa a
traitor and now they are asking him to get
up and drive.
The British advance into Matabeleland
Js said to have been checked by the rinder
pest, which is killing all the cattle in the
country, and thus does the little microbe
interfere with the extension of empires.
The weather reports from the East show
â¢n extraordinary hot spell extending over
nearly the whole country east of the Mis
souri Eiver, and still there is no sign tbat
tbe suffering people have sense enough to
come West
Though the Democratic leaders try eyer
so hard to distract the attention of the
people by raising a multitude of side is
sues, the intelligent voter will stick to the
main ooiat and cast his ballot for protec
tion and sound money.
While international bimetallism would
be of undoubted benefit to the country, it
must not be forgotten that, as the Repub
lican National platform says, "the bul
wark of American industrial independence
and the foundation of American develop
ment and prosperity" are to be found in
the policy of protection to industry and
wages.
Â»
The nomination of Mr. Dinkelspiel for
Congress gives the people of tbe Foarth
District a chance to be represented in tbe
next House by a man wbo wilL be thor
oughly devoted to their interests and to
those of California, and who can be
counted on to serve his constituents with
seal, fidelity and ability on every issue
that arises.
There are abundant reasons for believ
ing that an administration which would
restore prosperity in mis country would
be able to obtain tbe co-operation of
France, Germany and Austria in the re
monetization of silver, and with that alli
ance formed it would not be long before
England would have to open her mint's to
silver in self-defense.
International bimetallism will cause a
much larger demand for silver than could
be caused by free coinage in this country
alone and, therefore, even to the extreme
advocates of silver the Republican party
offers better prospects than are promised
by Democracy ; and, besides, a Democratic
promise in 1896 is worth no more than the
promise made in 1892.
CALLING FOR HELP.
The silver Democracy at Chicago mocked
at Hiil, hooted at the name of Cleveland,
denounced every conservative leader of
the party, read them out of the ranks, and
proudly proclaimed the intention of play
ing a lone hand. Never in recent history
did any faction of any party in any coun
try more loftily assert itself to be the
Julius Caesar of politics and set forth more
jauntily to bestride tbe narrow world like
a Colossus.
Not a month has passed since that os
tentatious assertion of power, not time
enough as Tom Heed says to ripen a
strawberry, and behold this Julius Caesar
finding itself drowning in the rising flood
of public condemnation, stretches out its
hands to Gorman, to Hill, to Cleveland,
and with a wail of agony cries out, "Help,
Gassius, or I sink !" Did modern politics
ever show a more speedy collapse of vanity
than this, or a more striking example of a
Cses&r forced to confess his mortality at
the very moment he was posing in the at
titude of a god ?
How long has it been since Democracy,
flushed with rage against American in
dustry, denounced Gorman for opposing
the extreme free-trade features of tue
Wilson tariff? How long has it been
since Democracy, in alliance with Popu
lism, denounced Hill for opposing the
socialistic income tax? How long has it
been since it denounced Cleveland in both
houses of Congress, in State conventions
and in the National Convention? All
these denunciations are matters of recent
occurrence. They are fresh in the minds
of men. Cleveland, Hill and Gorman feel
as yet the sting of them unabated, and
now these men are asked to come forward
to save their traducers and give help to
the boasters who not only beat them with
stripes, but bragged of it afterward.
Cleveland, Hill and Gorman in their iso
lation from their party form a strange
combination. Hill tried his best to defeat
Cleveland for the nomination in 1892 and
did send to the convention a New York
delegation against him. Cleveland dur
ing the controversy over the Wilson tariff
denounced Gorman as a traitor to the peo
ple who elected him. Hiil and Gorman
as rivals for leadership in the party have
been bitter foes for two years. Each there
fore is the enemy of the other two. They
now find themselves set adrift on the po
litical sea in a water-logged boat, and
while each is wondering what he can do
to save himself and drown the other two,
lo there comes to them the wailing cry of
the captain of their Democratic ship,
"Come aboard and save us."
The whole episode shows not only
the lack of harmony among Democratic
leaders, but the utter want ot self-respect
among those who headed the free silver
fight. After denouncing the Eastern lead
ers they now go on their knees and beg
help. If there is anything Cleveland, Hill
or Gorman wishes in the way of a promise
at this time he can have it Julius Cse^ar
amid the waves will concede anything to
Cassius. It will be in vain after this that
silver Democrats talk of throwing over
Clereiandism, Tammanyism and the Gor
man machine. They have found already
that they are incompetent to manage pol
itics, and whichever of tbe old leaders will
respond to the appeal for help can have
the captain's trumpet and take possession
of the ship.
THE TROUBLES OF SPAIN.
It would seem that Spain is likely to
bare to confront a rebellion right at home
in the near future. The Cuban revolution
ists have had acents in Spain for some
months working up sympathy for Cuba
in particular and spreading the gospel of
personal liberty generally. The province
of Valencia is already protesting very
vigorously against sending any more
troops to Cuba, and there has been con
siderable rioting. The Spanish Minister
of tbe Interior admits that there is a
growing opposition among the people to
further expenditure of men and money in
what appears to them to be a vain attempt
to subjugate the Cuban rebels.
There is beginning to be considerable
grumbling, too, over the excessive tax
levies for war purposes. Were the Span
iards confident that Cuba could be re
claimed it is possible no protests would be
heard against doing it without stopping to
count the cost, but it appears the public
has lost confidence in tbe Government's
ability to grasp a great question, besides
no one seems to have any confidence in
Weyler's ability to cope with the insur
gent generals.
But aside from all tbat the sentiment
that Spain would be better off under a
republican form of government has been
growing for several years, and no doubt
there is a large following that is ready to
change the form of the administration.
There is a suspicion also tbat General
Campos would rather see the Cubans suc
ceed tban not. He fought them during
tbe rebellion of 1868-78, and commanded in
the present war until relieved by Weyler,
and no doubt he would not like to see his
enemy Weyler accomplish what he fails
to do. But anyway Spain is like a house
divided against itself, and what adds to
the distress is that the nation has already
reached the stage of bankruptcy.
FOR A PROTECTIVE TARIFF.
Democratic orators will lead none astray
by asserting that tbe Republican party is
pledged to "high protection," and that if
Major McKinley is elected an industrial
Chinese wall will be built around the
country. Never in its history did the Re
publican party declare for such protection.
The St. Louis platform, like all previous
declarations of tbe Republican party,
provides for "a protective tariff" to pro
tect what? Surely not ruinous competition.
The United States is a nation of sover
eigns whose political and industrial
strength is great or little in ratio to the
interblending of their varied interests on
the basis of mutual dependence. That is
to say, each sovereign is entrenched in his
rights in ratio to tbe harmonious adjust
ment of those things which are necessary
to his own protection to the needs of every
other sovereign.
The fundamental purpose of this Gov
ernment is to secure the right to every cit
izen to go in pursuit of happiness to the
point where to go beyond would be to
trespass upon the rights of another. The
aim of "a protective tariff" as advo
cated by the Republican party is to so ad
just the industrial factors iv the common
wealth that each sovereign may have open
and free opportunity to secure to himself
all the benefits contemplated and made
possible by the proper conduct of the pub
lic affairs"of tne community as a whole.
The purpose of a protective tariff is to
develop the resources of the country with
the country's own capital and labor; for
unless capital and labor are assured of
protection against enemies who would rob
them of the fruits of their energy and skill
they might better remain in idleness. But
prohibitory protection is not demanded.
Indeed, such protection would enforce
isolation, a condition the Republican party
is pledged to prevent. and to encourage
healthy competition, which is the life of
commerce.
It is tbe business of a protective tariff
to secure the development of tbe vast re
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 1896.
sources of this country in a way tbat shall
amply remunerate capital and labor. For
more than a third of a century the
schedule of wages paid to labor in tbe
United States has been from 25 per cent to
more tban 100 per cent higher than in
other countries, and this difference the
Republican party proposes to maintain in
any event. Capital is more than willing
that the wages of American labor should
be very much higher than in other coun
tries, out capital must be protected against
the product of cheap labor in other coun
tries if it is to maintain a high wage
schedule in its own industrial plants.
This the Republican party agrees to do,
but only up to tbe point where high wages
to labor and a reasonable profit to
capital are secured. After that foreign
mill and factory products may come in
competition by paying for the privilege in
the shape of customs duties.
High protection would not allow foreign
competition under any circumstances,
while free trade would invite competition
without providing protection to the
American wage schedule against tbe low
wages of other countries, which would
operate to oblige our labor to conform to
the wage schedules of Europe and the
Orient or go into idleness. High protec
tion would put American labor at the
mercy of capital, and free trade would put it
at tbe mercy of foreign pauper competition,
but a tariff for protection would hold the
wages of labor to the highest possible point
and protect it against the cheap labor of
other countries on the one hand, and
against capital encroachment on the other.
REPUBLICAN BIMETALLISM.
The difference between tbe Republican
and Democratic parties on the silver coin
age question is one of metnod. Both par
ties are for bimetallism. For tbat matter,
more than 99 per cent of the people of this
country are bimetallists, but the majority,
which includes nearly all the conductors
of business enterprises, believe tbat silver
should be reraonetized according to the
law of trade interchange and not in oppo
sition to it.
No one will deny that silver bullion has
a market value of little over one-half of
its value in an American dollar, nor will
any intelligent person deny that the rea
son an American silver dollar is the
equivalent of a gold dollar is because the
gold dollar guarantees its redemption
value to be equal to its own, but the gold
dollar does not guarantee any value to
bullion siiver.
The plan proposed by the Repnblican
party is, first, to restore silver bullion to
the coin value by an- agreement between
all nations that maintain a monetary sys
tem like our own. That is, the nations
which maintain silver coins at their face
value by obliging gold to guarantee their
parity with itself. When silver bullion
shall have been restored to a parity with
gold then open the mints to both metals
upon the basis of their free and unlimited
coinage.
The Democratic plan is to open the
mints first at an arbitrary and contradict
ory; ratio and adjust tbe bullion value
afterward. Tne Republican party believes
with all commerce, all trade operations
and all industrial activity that until all
parties in interest have agreed to restore
the bullion value of siiver, coins made of
such bullion would possess no more re
demption value than their weight in bul
lion, unless they we r e guaranteed by gold,
and if that were done it would not be
bimetallism, but gold monometallism.
Whenever a circulating money medium
looks to something separate from itself to
guarantee its worth it is token money,
and its intrinsic vaiue is equal to no more
nor less than what it would sell for as a
commodity in tbat which guarantees its
redemption value as money. The mone
tary system of the United States, and it is
in harmony with the systems of the com
mercial nations, authorizes the Govern
ment to buy silver bullion and coin it into
dollars, the Government guaranteeing tbe
commodity purchasing power of such coins
to be equal with that of gold.
Now the difference between the plan of
the Republican and the Democratic par
ties to establish both metals in the chan
nels of commerce is this: The Democratic
party proposes to abruptly withdraw the
gold guarantee. It assumes that silver
can and would force commerce to accept it
as the equal of gold at a ratio that com
merce says is unjust and unnatural. Tbe
Republican plan is to first have commerce
advance the value of silver in bullion to
its value when coined without considering
gold at all, except to measure and fix the
difference tbat should obtain between the
weight of a gold and a silver dollar.
\vhen the ratio is agreed upon silver
would be a money metal of itself, redeem
able in itself and always interchangeable
with gold, which plan would increase the
volume of the redemption money of com
merce in an amount exactly equal to the
worla's production of silver. In other
words, tbe Democratic plan to secure
bimetallism would drive gold out of tbe
channels of commerce, while the Repub
lican plan would not only retain gold in
the markets, but give it a coworker whose
purchase and redemption power would be
equal to tbe silver of the world, and the
metals would perform their work in per
fect harmony.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
C. B. Moulton, a leading young attorney of
Tacoma, Is in the City on business for the
Northern Bacific Railroad. He states that the
Northern Pacific will in a few days pass from
under the charge oi a receiver to that of the
omcers of the rehabiltated company. The
name of the new company is the Northern Pa
cific Railway ComDany. Before the days of
the receiver it whs the Northern Pacific Rail
road Company, it v incorporated now under
the laws of Minnesota.
There will be no change in the management.
The vast domain of land belonging to the old
company is now being transferred to the new
by Bale under the order of the special Master
in Chancery. That being completed the work
of Andrew Burleigh, the receiver, will have
been completed and he will retire in favor of the
officers of the company. E. W. Winters is the
new president.
Mr. Moulton states that there is nothing fur
ther to the story that Jim Hill of the Great
Northern would have a hand in the affairs of
the Northern Pacific, although at one time
there was considerable meaning in it. The
Northern Pacific Railway Company is to re
main a distinct entity, the gieatest stretch of
railroad in the world, with the beautiful city
of Tacoma at the head of navigation on Puget
Sound as its western terminus.
Of Tacoma and the wide celebrity it has at
tained through its dishonest officials Mr. Moul
ton has thi* to say: "While Taeoma has been
greatly harmed, no doubt, through its widely

advertised financial difficulties, it has been as
greatly benefited by the heroic measures
adopted in recovering from it. I do not be
lieve that Tacoma is any worse than any of its
neighbors are; indeed, any city on the Pacific
Coast. The difference mainly lies in the fact
that she has taken the trouble to eradicate the
evil. There has been a good deal more smoke,
too, than fire in all thin. Politicians have
tried to make capital out of the circumstances
and so have exaggerated them, In other
words, what other cities have concealed, Ta
coma has advertised to the whole world. How
ever that is about all done with now, and as a
result Tacoma is in a better way. to go forward
triumphantly with the coming new era. With
the return of prosperity to the country at large
Tacoma will steD io the front among the young
Cities of the West. As the Western terminus
of the Northern Pacific Railway, enjoying un
equaled advantages of location at the head of
navigation on the American Mediterranean,
with a magnificent harbor in the heart of a
country abounding in timber, coal and iron
ore, the city must develop into one of the
greatest cities of the West.
"The only fear that we have," continued
Mr. Monlton, "is centered in the next election.
If this silver heresy obtains then the period of
depression which has checked the growth of
the Northwest will certainly continue. With
the election of Major McKinley and the suc
cess of honest money then we will begin to
move forward in leaps and bounds. The popu
lar impression that Washington is a silver
State is not well founded. It is not true.
Hugh Wallace, the Democratic National Com
mitteeman, is a straight-out gold man. He
hus not renounced the Chicago platform, but
it is not likely he will give it very hearty sup
port. Tbe Populists are not at all enthusiastic
over the work of the St. Louis convention. If
they refuse to combine with the Democrats
then the triumph of McKinley is certain. With
It comes prosperity."
"It Is patriotism, protection, prosperity and
prunes with us down in Santa Clara County.
Isn't that right, Pomeroy?" said D. W. Burch
ard, the San Jose lawyer, as he puffed dream
ily at a good cigar and awaited a reply from
his friend, Marshall Pomeroy, the orchardist,
of Santa Clara, who happened just then to be
gazing intently out of a frout window in the
Grand Hotel.
"She's all rightâ at least, that Is, prunes
why, yes; you're correct there," assented the
man from Santa Clara.
"Well," resumed the lawyer, "we want Mc-

at issue. Santa Clara County alone produces
several million dollars' worth of fruit per an

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE FIRST PLOW.
CHAKLE3 8. Capp Believes It Was Made for
Him in Stockton in 1851.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
In your paper of yesterday appeared a tele
graphic item from San Jose announcing the
death of John Balbacb, a pioneer of Santa
Clare County. In the course of the item occurs
the following statement:
In tbe spring of 1852 Mr. Balbach manufactured
the first plow ever made on tbe Pacific (oast, and
the following year he made over fifty plows.
The statement as to tbat beiug the first plow
made here is inaccurate. While not sure by
any means tbat my plow was "the first plow
manufactured on the Pacific Coast," it ante
dated the above by at least a year, for early in
the spring of 185 i I had a plow made for me
in Stockton. The share was made from a piece
of boiler-iron, first cut in tne shape of a dia
mond and bent so as to turn the sod. So the
maker called it a â 'diamond plow," and said
he had made lots of them in Missouri or some
where in the Western States. The coulter was
made from one or two large rasps or flat files
beaten out into the required shape. Though I
am not positive as to the amount, I believe the
plow/when ? completed s cost "me i $100. â '.* The
maker â was j a blacksmith and wagon-maker,
-whose shop was near the present site of . tne
County Courthouse. If lam not mistaken be
was ! known as Deacon Graves. Any old Stock
tonian will remember him, for he was a well
known and popular character. Besides being
a j capable ti mechanic â he i. as \a - good, old
fashioned, loud-viced I Method exhorter; and
not ashamed of his religion or disposed to hide
his light under a bushel. â  - ; ; v . : . / : r ' "I:-," 1
:<. This plow was used by â¢ me and â  a couple of
partners iin j putting ;in; a ' crop of ; barley, and
some corn, and vegetables, on a ranch we had
located on the Calaveras River, about twelve
miles s above ' Stockton. 5 The t corn and * vege
tables were harvested before they were ripe by
a band of horses, owned by a neighbor and
driven down upon us at night, when feed be
gan to be scarce, ; on ; the \ theory i that * settlers
had no rights as against stockmen; The bar
ley we cut and thrashed Mexican fashion by,
driving the : oxen over it ;on a circular space
prepared for . the I purpose, and j winnowed by
tossing up I the chaff and. grain in the after
noon breeze. We sacked it and carried it up
to the mines on an ox-team, and sold it at
Murphys and AngelSjCanip about September 1,

; lam sore that it was said at the time to bo
the first plow ever made in Stockton, and that
the maker was the omy blacksmith there who
professed to be able to make a plow, for I in
quired carefully,: before I agreeing; Ito pay the
price demanded. But there had been a few
settlers at French Camp, near Stockton; before
the gold fever broke out, and there were also
settlers " north of San * Francisco ?. who t raised
, wheat for the Russians, and other American
and European settlers in the Santa Clara Val
ley and the southern part of the State who cul
tivated more or less land, and among them
might have been some one or more who, not
content with the Mexican wooden plow had
employed some village blacksmith to make an
iron p.ow share and coulter long before the
plow wns built by me early In 1851. But if
there were such I have not heard of them.

SAN FRANCISCO SHOEMAKERS.
How ths Indtjstry Cax Bb Revived fob the
Benefit of All.
Ban Francisco, Aug. 1, 1896.
Editor Callâ Sir: As The Call speaks for all
and is an earnest advocate of home industries,
the notice in your issue of the 28th inst of a
â¢meeting of shoemakers in an effort to revive
what was once a flourishing industry of our
City recalled to my mind that the manu- :
facturers, with the aid of Fugitive Waltbew,
their efficient secretary, have accomplished
their efforts not to be "dictated to by labor
unions and run their business as suited them
selves." Which they have done, with the re
sult that instead of hundreds of shoemakers
being employed, their factories are mere
skeletons of what they were before they began
their crusade for "freedom," and now that
their business languishes and their trade has
been absorbed by the East, we, with that
Christian spirit that always animates true
trade unionists and those who have the wel
fare of our State at heart, will meet them more
than half way to revive prosperity in their
business, but on true union lines.
If they are sincere in their desire for a re
vival of trade in their particular branch of in
dustry, It can only be brought about by a con
certed movement among themselves to cease
buying all of their stocks from the East and
advertising it as of home manufacture, when
all of us know that such is not the case, and
join hands to restore the Shoemakers' White
Lnbor League to its former position before it
was disrupted by their combined and unwise
efforts, and to place their stamp on no goods
but those made here. I firmly believe the
labor unions, with the assistance of all who
have the interests of our City and the Drosper
itv of its citizens at heart, will do the rest, and
all be benefited in the end, but no duplicity
will gain the much-desired object
We must all work together, and by advertis
ing, personal nppeals, etc., their unwise action
of trying to disrupt labor unions and destroy
ing their own business can in a few years once
more be restored to them. Respectfully,
James B. Fkankltn,
San Francisco, August 1, 1896.
LADY WAIST WITH BOLERO.
The bolero in all its forms is the particular
fad of fashion at present. Here it is shown in
combination with a new sleeve, ,which is
wrinkled below the puff, and is known as the
mousquetaire.
A dress of black canvas cloth, with lining of
green and violet taffetas, had jacket fronts of
both, the canvas being cut an inch smaller to
allow the silk jacket to show. Both were sim
ply hemmed by hand in the neatest manner
possible. The waist front was of black mous
seline de soie. The belt and collar were of the
silk.
Wash dresses make up well after this model,
using lace or embroidery for the bolero.
A gown of batiste in linen color had the
jacket of tbe same embroidered in white, with
tbe front of the waist of white dimity of tbe
sheered kind. The wrinkled sleeves were of
the dimity, with linen puffs.

IT WILL BRING PROSPERITY.

Out of protection alone can come public rev
enues, restored wages and increased business..
Supply revenues a?am and our public credit
will be resumed. Uplift wages to where they
were and there will be money enough. Put
the old healthful, vigorous life into business
and debts wiii disappear. By protection we
can do this. By protection we can supply the
dollars and we can make them honestâloo
-cent dollars worth 100 cents all over the
world. Upon Republicans, therefore, and
upon every man who loves his country and
honors its integrity, we rely for a triumphant
vindication at the election in November of
the American principle of protection.
NO BLANK CARTRIDGES.
New York Commercial Advertiser.
General Dan Sickles' advice to "use no blank
cartridges," in other words, to vote forMe-
Kinicy and for no third candidate if the pre
servation of the country's financial Integrity
is desired, should be kept in mind by every
loverof his country. Every vote is needed to
administer a crushing blow to the policy of re
pudiation.
States Government has assumed sinoe 1&J1
and the amount of interest in each. The
figures are taken from the report of the Sfcore
tary of the Treasury^
to settle conflicting questions and interpreta
tions of tbe laws by virtue of which such obli
gations have been contracted, it i- hereby
provided and declared that tbe faith of the

MORE THAN EVER AN ISSUE.
New York Press.
If there is one thing that the American
people have learned in the last three years it
is that only protection will make work for the
wage-earner, profit for the investor and reve
nue 'or the Government. Without protection
a sound currency in the future would "be pow
erless to stop the ravages of a destructive econ
omic policy, just as it has been in the past
Our treasury deficiencies would continue to
drain our reserve, we should continue to in
crease our public and private debt to foreign
ers and our Nation would continue to languish
because capital would see* in vain for profita
ble investment and labor would search hope*
lessly for living wages.
Therefoie, we say, and every truthful Re
publican says, that tne tariff this year is more
than ever p.n issue. It is an issue of over
whelming Importance. It is the issue of the
American people, made by themselves, for
themselvesâ an issue to which the Repnblican
party is pledged in its platform, and the man
who hopes to induce Republicans to disown
protection for the sake oi votes or of anything
else, hopes for something that is impossible
among men of principle and honor.
Protection and Republicanism are one and
the same. Neither can be thought of without
the other. Each is the life of the other. They
stand together, and if one falls, so must the
other fall. In this campaign the Republican
party will fignt under its true colors, if it
fights single-handed against all other parties.
THE BOLTING NEWSPAPERS.
Boston Herald.
The number of newspapers that hare bolted
the Democratic ticket for tne Presidency is
now reported to have reached nearly 200. We
doubt if the public fully realize the significance
of this demonstration. Nothing like it, we
thiDk, has ever been known before in American
politics â certainly nothing like it in thÂ«
previous history of the proverbially faithful
Democratic party. Here are the elements of
disintegration, if it is possible to produce
them. The places of none of these bolting
journals have been filled, it will be observed,
by accessions from the other Bide, beyond the
limits of a few of the smallest States of the
union. We see no noting of accessions of any
importance outside of the press in any other
quarter than this limited one in point of num
bers. There are plenty of rumors of what is to
be, but how feeble is the figure they cut in
contrast with the solid facts above noted 1

AN OVERDUE SHIP ARRIVES.
The Santa Clara, on Whch Rein
surance Was Paid, Had an Un
eventful Voyage.
Henry Peterson, champion oarsman of
the Pacific Coast, had a narrow escape
yesterday. In attempting to escape a
tide-rip he eot into the swell caused by
the tug Sea Queen and his outrigger cap
sized. For a few moments the oarsman
was in imminent danger, but he finally
succeeded in clearing himself, and then
swam to the wharf, pushing his boat be
fore him.
Peterson expects to row Hanlan, ex
champion of the world, at Vancouver,
B. C, next month. Hanlan was matched
to meet Jake Gaudaur tor the champion
ship of America, but, as the latter has se
cured a match with Stanbury, champion
of the world, his agreement witn the Van
couver people is off. Peterson is expected
to take Gaudaur's place, and if the race
takes place all California will back the
San Francisco boy.
In expectation of the race bring made
Peterson has been in training tor over a
fortnight. Every morning he is out in his
shell, and is now almost in perfect con
dition. Yesterday he gave the tug Red
mond a brush, and more than held his
own until Captain Dave Shaw "opened
up" the engines, and then the steamer
gradually drew aw*y. When the Sea
Queen came along Peterson was making a
final spurt. Captain "Ike" Smith called
to him, "Look out, Henry, I'm eoing to
make a sharp turn," but the warning
came too late.
The shell would have been carried on to
the wharf had the oarsman stopped row
ing, so Peterson called back, "Can't help
it, Ike ; I must take the chance.' ' He took
it, and the wash from the tug's screw cap
sized the skiff.
The oarsman's feet were caught in the
stretchers, and it was some time before he
could free himself. In the meantime the
Sea Queen had made a circuit and came to
the rescue. Peterson, however, refused
assistance, and pushing his shell before
him reached Spear-street wharf in safety.
The champion is a born oarsman and is
as modest as a schoolgirl. He has been
rowing races since he was 10 yars old, and
as he sa d yesterday, "I have never been
an amateur." Boating has been his busi
ness since he was able to earn a living, and
a more thoroughly respected man cannot
be found on the water front to-day. Should
he meet Hanlan on Facet Sound all the
money of the San Francisco boys will be
behind him.
The first news from the whaling fleet
was received by Bruce, Bowne sfc Co.
yesterday. It only includes the Kodiak
fleet, and reports that the Charles W.
Morgan had 800 gallons of sperm oil and
one right whale; the Cape Horn Pigeon
had two right wnales, 800 gallons of sperm
and 200 gallons of whale oil, while the
best the Alice Knowles could do was one
right whale.
Among the arrivals yesterday was the
American ship Santa Clara. She is an
other of the overdue fleet, but Captain
Fuller says that there was never one
moment when he had any anxiety for his
vessel. Contrary winds were met with off
the Horn, but the ship made the run from
50 to 50 in thirty-six days. Heavy re
insurance was paid on the Santa Clara,
and again the gamblers "come out on top."
The British ship Jordanbill docked at
Union-street wharf yesterday. Captain
Taylor has a regular menagerie on board
and it attracts quite & crowd. He has

breeding may not be all that might be
desired, but nevertheless the master of the
Jordanuill is willing to match any of his
birds against anything in San Francisco.
Captain Taylor has quite a number of
song birds in his coops, all of which were
hatched while tne ship was in the gales
and hurricanes that were encountered off
the Horn.
The steamer Point Arena for Point

SAUSALITO'S POOLROOMS
A Raid Made by the Marshal
on Schwartz & Co.'s
Place.
Five Employes Made to Put Up Fifty
Dollars Bail Eachâ Schwartz's
Complaint.
SAUSALITO, Cal., Aug. 6.â At 2p. m.
to-day Marshal Creed, witn bis deputy E.
Cramer, entered the poolrooms operated
by Schwartz <fe Co. and alter reading a
warrant arrested five employes behind the
counter.
This made matters pretty lively among
the crowd, which at that time numbered
n. arly 100 of the sporting fraternity. They
seemed entirely taken by surprise. Noth
ing more than Joud talk occurred, how
ever, as the employes were marched away
to the courtroom. No one was left to look
after the chalk and blackboards.
Judge Fryor looked very dignified in his
magisterial capacity, and when the five
were placed in iine before his Honor the
defendants pleaded not guilty. Fifty dol
lars cash bail was demanded from each.
The money was at once put up. The
Judge allowed Mr. Schwartz one week to
employ counsel, when the case will come
up !or trial.
So ended the first round, and the pool
rooms at 2:45 p. m. were again in full
swing. The proceedings caused consider
able amusement and the water front pre
sented quite an animated appearance.
Schwartz on being interviewed stated
that he was willing to put up hia money,
but does not see why be should be perse
cuted more than Mr. Harrison, against
whom there is a simiiar case pending for
more than one month. If Mr. Harrison
had been tried and convicted he would not
have started here. He started, however,
with the best of intentions, not think
ing he was infracting the law. If Harrison
should be convicted be will be willing to
tnrow up the sponge, but he insists on the
Harrison case being tried first. In the
meantime the poolrooms are all doing a
rushing business and Judge, attorneys and
Marshal are accordingly happy.

COPPER MINED IK
EDEN VALLEY.
The Slovenian Colony
Working on a New
Industry.
COLONISTS DELIGHTED.
They Are Busy Day and Night
in Two "Shifts" in the
Mine.
AIDED BY A BIG BYNDICATE.
Father Jeram Coming to San Fran*
Cisco on Business Connected
With the Enterprise.
As a result of the settlement of Eden
Valley, Mendocino County, by Slovenian
Catholic colonists, a very important in
dustry is now being developed there, and
just at present the indications forecast a
source of vast wealth to those directly in
terested.
The promoters of the colonVi it now ap
pears, were especially fortunate in select
ing the beautiful and fertile Eden Valley,
for they are now rewarded with unlimited
supplies of coal, lumber and, most impor
tant of all, a wonderfully rich copper
mine.
It ia claimed for this mine that without
the land and timber it would more than
repay the colony for its enterprise. In its
present stage the copper mine is no mere
speculation, but a reality. All the pre
liminary work has been finished. The
prospects have been made, the veins
traced fora long distance and satisfactorily
located, shafts sunk anu assays made.
And the result is very gratifying to all
concerned. The search for the veins cas
brought to light t'.e fact that a singularly
rich copper mine exists on the colony
tract in Eden Valley â one which in time
may become famous as a producer, and
one, too, that may add considerably to the
wealth of the State developed from her
natural resources.
One result of the various assays has been
to fill the colonists full of new hope and
contentment, and to satisfy the managing
spirits that all doubts about success of ihe
colony are dispelled, for the chemical
tests have demonstrated that the ore is
all exceedingly rich and capable of being
mined and reduced at a good profit. Be
sides, an expert has gone over the ground,
making a minute examination of the min
ing property, and submitted encouraging
reports.
And now quite a number of the colon
ists are working in the mine and earning
money.
The copper mine is not all the attraction
offered either, for deposits of coal of a
fine quality have been found in the valley,
or rather on the hillsides surrounding the
valley. The deposits are part of the vast
coal fields of the northeastern part of
Mendocino County. The quality of the
coal is well known to be up to the average
standard.
It is proposed to develop the coal mine
in conjunction with the copper mine and
other industries, tnough this may not be
for some time to come, as there is so much
firewood in that vicinity that coal may
not be needed for years. However, if the
coal can be mined at a profit and then
transported to Ukiab it is said that coal
mining will form a leading part of the
promised industries of Mendocino County.
Timber, of course, is so abundant that a
sawmill will be kept busy all the time
turning out lumber for building purposes
and lor the mine, and possibly for exporta
tion from the valley.
In connection with the copper mine as
well as the business of the agricultural
colony, the Rev. Father Jeram is coming
to San Francisco early next week. It is
understood that his purpose is to attend
to some legal and other affairs.
A shareholder, who is one of the prin
cipal men in the colony, said yesterday :
"We have preat hopes for the future,
especially since the copper mine has
proved a rich one. The mine is being
worked. Two shifts of men are employed ,
one by day and the other by nignt, and
they are taking out considerable ore while
opening the shaft. A syndicate of East
ern capitalists has taken bold of the mine,
having the necessary capital to work it,
but the colony will share the benefits de
rived from it.
"The colony retains an interest in the
copper mine, which will give employment
to the colonists.
"We are erecting a sawmill to be op
erated by steam power. The mill will be
employed, just as soon as it is completed,
to cut lumber for building houses for the
colonists, and also for barns, fences,
stores, etc. As soon as the sawmill is
started there will be busy times in the
colony, and it will all rest with the people
themselves then to put the agricultural
colony on a sound basis, altogether inde
pendent of the mine and lumber-mill."
RAISING THE COLOMBIA
Engineer Tabrett's Challenge to the
Pacific Mail Virtually Accepted
by an Official.
In The Call of July 3 there was printed
a statement as follows:
H. C. Tabrett, superintending engineer of
the Risdon Iron Works, says that if the Pacific
Mail Company will give his firm the contract
he will raise the Colombia and bring her to
San Francisco inside ot two weeks.
This attracted the attention of one of
the high officials of the company men
tioned, who yesterday made the following
comment thereon:
"It appears that while this statement is
published in a newspaper for the benefit
of the public no such offer has been made
to any officer of the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company. There is no doubt that
the Pacific Mail Company would be will
ing to make such a contract on the basis
of no pay except on the delivery of the
vesselin San Francisco."
BOBBED BY BROTHERS.
Confession of a Convicted Burg
lar Recalls an Old
Crime.
Edward Vanderscweip Tells How the
Oberon Safe Was Looted Last
Oc'ober
The safe in the Oberon saloon on O'Far
rell street was robbed of $750 in the early
morning of October 25. The cashier had
put the money into the safe at 2:30 a. m. ;
then be shut the door, but neglected to
close the combination. Wnen ho returned
next morning about 8 o'clock the money
was gone.
Suspicion fell upon James Vanderscweip,
the night porter. He was in charge of
the bar after the cashier left and was
closely questioned by the proprietor. He
said no one had been near t.e bar after
the cashier left and he had not been out
of the saloon for a minute. He loudly
protested his innocence.
The police were notified and Detective
Gibson was detailed on the case. He
came to the conclusion that James and
his brother Edward, who was a discharged
employe of tne saloon, had committed the
robbery. He went to Berkeley, where
their mother lived. She said she knew
nothing of the robbery, but he searched
the house carefully. Nothing was found.
Then he went into the garden and no
ticed that at one spot the earth had been
recently disturbed. He dug down, but
found no money. He, however, found a
table napkin with the Oberon mark upon it.
The four corners had been tied together,
but one corner had been pulled loose.
This strengthened his suspicion, but it
was not enough to cause their arrest.
Word was received at police head
quarters last niuht from Fresno that
Edward had confessed to committing the
robbery with his brother James, who is
now serving a term in San Quentin for
burglary. Edward was arrested in Fresno
for burelary and yesterday was sentenced
to six years in San Quentin. Then he
made his confession.
He said that after the cashier left he
went into the saloon and saw his brother
James, who told him that the combina
tion of the safe was not closed. James
opened the safe, took out $750 and handed
it to him over the bar. He carried it
away, but he .did not say what they did
with it afterward.

having put several 16 to 1 gold pieces into
the enterprise. After that time Signor
Patricio Marsicano of this City acquired
possession of the whole worts, and if his
story is to be believed, he has not been
able to earn his salt.
Signor Marsicano was seen in his cozy
residence at 731 Green street last night by
a Call reporter. At first ne refused to
make any statement beyond the admis
sion that the works had been attached
and that he was the only sufferer.
Mr. Marsicano appears to bear the loss
of $11,000 like a brave man. He shed no
tears and did not seem to be sad about it.
In fact he was neither grave nor gay, his
air being that of philosophic resignation
over milk that had been spilled and lost.
"About two years ago 1 became the sole
owner of the works," ne said. "Competi
tion became so keen and the price of salt
got so low, that the more salt I sold the
more money I lost. So I have been wind
ing up the business for the past two years,
and," he added with a sigh of relief, "it
is wound up now for good."
"Is there a protective duty on salt?" was
asked.
"No," replied Signor Marsicano, "it
comes in Democratic, free of duty."
He gave tne information that his heavi
est creditor was S. P. Putman, "but," be
added, "I am the heaviest loser. 1 '

BROKE WITH THE
PACIFIC MIL
Bad Faith Charged to the
Imperial Japanese Steam
ship Company.
SUIT MAY BE BROUGHT.
Interesting International Com
plications Likely to Ariss
in the Case.
FACTS ABOUT THE NEW LINE.
Its Shares Said to Be Held in Part
by thÂ» Members of the Mika
do's Family.
Back of the failure of the Nippon Yusen
Kaisha (Imperial Japanese Steamship
Company) to make San Francisco its
American terminus lies an interestinc
bit of history, involving what appears to
be a violation of a contract by the Japanese
company. This contract was with the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company.
The chief reason assigned for the Yusen
Kaisha's giving San Francisco the cold
shoulder was that the Southern Pacific
Company had refused to enter into any
arrangements â  whereby the proposed
steamship line would receive equal con
sideration in the matter, of through busi
ness with the Pacific Mail. This state
ment was made by Mr. Kovo, the
Japanese Consul at this port, and the
alleged opposition of the railroad people
to the coming of the proposed steamship
line was attributed to the desire to protect
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.
In view of the cordial recept on and
hearty encouragement recently given by
the Southern Pacific representative to
President Asano of the Toyo Kisen
Kaisha (Oriental Steamship Company),
ana the contrast thus shown to the treat
ment accorded the Nippon Yusen Kaisha
people, it is conjectured that the action of
the railroad people toward the Imperial
Japanese Steamship Company was largely
inspired by the fact that the Imperial
Company had broken faith with the
Pacific Mail Steamship Corn cany.
"Early in the decade beginning with
1880." said General Manager Schwerin of
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company yes
terday, "the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany owned the coastwise lines of steam
ers in Japan. These were sold to the
Mitsu Bisiii Steamship Company, which
afterward became merged in the Nippon
Yuen Kaisha.
"Part of this transaction was the trans
fer of the good will of the steamship busi
ness in Japanese waters on the part of the
Paritic Mai! Steamship Company's lines,
and the transfer of the good will of the
Japanese line so far as the trans-Pacific
business is concerned. The Nippon Yusen
Kaisha was not to put on a line to any
Pacific port in the United States without
giving two years' notice in writing to us.
The Pacific Mail received notice only two
â¢weeks ago of the p:oposeil line to Seattle
to be operated by the Nippon Yusen Ka
isha."
Mr. Sobwerin declined to state what
proceedings would be taken against the
Japanese steamship company, but left it
to be iuferred that the matter would prob
ably be taken up in its legal aspect. An
interesting international suit may there
fore be one of the outgrowths of the pres
ent situation.
As the Nippon Yusen Kaisha is prac
tically a Government cone m any litiga
tion that results will present unique legal
phases. A large part of ttie suaies of the
company are supposed to beiong to the
Emperor and members of the imperial
family. A Prince was at one tirpe presi
dent of the company. It has a monopoly
of the coasting trade. It is exempt from
all harbor dues ami has other valuable
privileges in addition to its subsidy.
It is expected t! at the first vessel of the
Nippon Yusen Kaisha to run in connection
witn the Great Northern Railroad will sail
from SeattJe Augus 3>.an<i regularly there
after at intervals of three or four weeks.
Mr. Whitney, the peneral passenger agent
â¢of the Great Northern, is now arranging
the schedules and getting his printed mat
ter ready for advertising the enterDrise,
and the traffic department is making up
tne freight rates. Mr. Iwanaga, ilie gen
eral manager of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha
line, and Mr. McMillan, the Scotch gen
eral superintendent, are now making a
trip through the East, but will be back at
Seattle in time to meet the first steamer
when the arrives at that port. She left
Yokohama several days ago, and is ex
pected to make the voyage in fifteen or
B'xteen days.
The steamers that have been selected for
t his route were purchased by the Nippon
Yusen Kaisha for the use of the G-overn
iuent during the recent war with China,
and were in service as transports in mov
ing trooDs to Korea, Liao-tong and For
mosa. The most of them were built on
the Clyde. They are between 4000 and
5000 tons burden, and are fitted up with
all the comforts and conveniences de
manded by modern travel. The captains
are usually Englishmen or Scotchmen, al
though there are a few Americans and
Germans in the service. The other offi
cers and ail the crews are Japanese. It is
the policy of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha to
dispense with the services of foreigners as
fast as possible and place natives in com
mand of their ships, but they have found
that a foreign captain makes a vessel more
popular witn foreign travelers and yield
that concession for ousiness reasons.
It is understood that the new steamship
company will be able to control rates, as it
receives an 8 per cent guaranty from the
Government of Japan. There is said to
be no intention, i.owever, to disturb the
present schedules which are maintained
by the Pacific Mail, the Canadian Pacific,
the Occidental and Oriental and all except
tne tramp steamers. The Great Nortnern
Company will simply seek its share of the
traffic at existing rates.
The chief reason for establishing the
new service, in addition to national pride,
is to import iron and cotton into Japan
direct from the United States instead of
Tia England. Of the $10,000,000 worth of
raw cotton imported by the mills of
Japan nearly 90 per cent comes from the
United States, but not a pound of it ap
pears in the statistics of commerce be
tween the two countries. It is shipped
from Savannah, Charleston, Brunswick,
Mobile and New Orleans to Liverpool,
consigned to British middlemen, who
tranship it to Kobe and Osaka and charge
a big margin. For some inexplicable
reason there has never been a direct
trade. But now, with the new steamers,
the Japan mills will be supplied direct,
and they have already contracted with the
Nippon Yusen Kaisha to supply them
with so many bales a year for a term of
years at a price so much above the regu
lar market quotations as to cover trans
portation, insurance, handlinc and other
charges.
. Therefore, the principal cargo westward
will be cotton. For that reason the Nippon
Yusen Kaisha were for a time negotiating
with the Santa Fe road for a connection at
San Diego, Cal. It is a long and expen
sive haul for cotton from the gulf States to
Puget Sound, but Mr. Hill has made sat
isfactory traffic arrangement with the
J'iiriois Central Railway and a line of
Mississ'ppi River boats to deliver a certain
quan iuy annually at his warehouses at
St. Paul. As most of the present business
of the Great Northern is eastbound, lie
can haul it westward over his owii line as
cheaply as empty "cars. The east-bound
freight will be principally tea, raw silK
and rice.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 1896.
JEALOUS RAGE, A
SHOT, AN DAH,
The Green -Eyed Monster
and Liquor Cause a
Tragedy.
SHE WAS TIRED OF HIM.
Mrs. Frankie Sopher Would
Rather Die Than Return
to Her Husband.
HE TOOK HER AT HER WORD.
Culmination of a Series of Domestic
Quarrels Lasting Over Seven
teen Years.
Suicide followed a most cruel attempt at
murder yesterday morning in the Bruns
wick House on Sixth street.
John Sopher, a man nearly 40 years of
age, whose jealousy and whose love for
drinK were his predominating traits, en
tered his wife's room, where she and her
roommates, Mrs. Libbie Barker and May
Sopher, the 12-year-old daughter of the
couple, were chatting yesferday morning.
Sopher did not appear to have been
drinking. Quite the contrary; he assumed
a pleasant air and accepted a light break
fast which his wife offered him. There
was nothing to indicate that the man in
tended murder, and he quit the room
shortly without making any offensive
demonstration.
Subsequently, Sopher returned. He was
still sober, and, approaching his wife, he
asKed her whether she would return and
live with him.
Her answer in the negative, witn the
addition teat she would die first, brought
about the climax.
He drew a small 38-caliber revolver
from his pocket and fired at the woman,
the pistol almost touching her. She
staggered back and almost fainting fell
out into the hallway where she swooned.
Believing be had killed his wife Sopher
turned the weapon on himself. He fired
and the bullet penetrated his right temple
and brain and he fell upon bis face with
tne pistol beneath his body, dead.
The Sophers have not agreed for many
years of their married life. She was a
hard working woman, earning a livelihood
by working out as a servant in this City
and in the country. Three times in Bev
enteen years they disagreed sufficiently to
separate, Sopher squandering in drink the
little money she earned. At times he
abused her and frequently threatened her
life.
One week ago Mrs. Sopher and her
friend, Mrs. Libbie Barker, arrived here
from Dixon, where both had been at work
as domestics, and neither dreamed of the
visit they were to receive from Sopher.
He also came in from the country,
tanned and uncouth, and without stop
ping anywhere else he hied himself to the
room where he shot his wife and killed
himself.
Mrs. Sopher was taken to the Receiving
Hospital in the ambulance and Drg. Weil
#
and Fitzgibbon did all they could to alle
viate her sufferings. They found that the
bullet bad struck h<r on the left side oi
the jaw, fracturing it and lacerating her
tongue, and then passed downward, lodg
ing in her neck alongside the trachea. In
her weak state it was not considered .ad
visable to attempt to extract the bullet.
The wound is not necessarily fatal.
In the afternoon she was allowed by the
doctors to make a statement, but she
could only talk in a whisper and with dif
ficulty.
"We were married." she said, "seven
teen years ago in Ferndale, Humboldt
County. Three children have been born
to vs â Ivy 15 years of age, John 13 and
May 12. He was 39 years of age and lam
33.
"For the past ten years he has been
abuÃing me and mating my life miserable
through his jealousy and his drinking
habits. I bore it all for the sake of the
children, but three or four months ago,
when we were living at Twelfth and How
ard streets, I left him, taking May with
me. and went to Dixon, Solano County,
where I got work on Wolf'a ranch as a
cook. The boy was sent to the Boys' and
Girls' Aid Society and Ivy got a situation
with Mrs. Johnston at Spring Valley. She
got wayward and two months ago was
sent to the Magdalen Asylum.
"I returned to the City about a week ago
with my daughter and engaged a room in
the Brunswick House. He came to see
me and quarreled with me about Will
Graham, a barber in Berkeley, who is a
friend of ours. He was jealous of Graham,
in fact he was jealous about every man
who spoke to me. Graham called upon
me on Tuesday, having been invited by
my husband.
"My husband came into my room this
morning. He was smiling and he asked
me if I would go back and live again with
him. I said I would not, but if he stopped
drinking and promised not to abuse me I
might. He said he wanted me to do it
now, and I told him no. He went out
and bought a revolver, returning in about
five or ten minutes. L was sitting on the
top of a bureau vhen he entered. He
came right up to me with one of his sneer
ing laughs ana tired the shot at me. Then
I saw him place the revolver against his
temple, fire again and drop on the floor.
"His father, brothers and sisters live in
Fortuna, Rnmboldt County, and my
parents live there also."
The Deputy Coroners removed the dead
body from the Brunswick House to the
Morgue. There was 15 cente in the pock
ets of a seedy plaid suit and two letters or
notes. Stripped of some of their errors they
read as follows :
San Fkancisco, August 3, 1896.
Frankie Sopher: You promised me the Ist
of January that you would live with me. By
my good conduct I swear that I will do every
thing in my power to do right. But you must
not deceive me, nor fool me in any way, and I
won't fool you, nor deceive you.
J. L. Sopher.
And you promised me th&t you would not go
with any man. I have a brother and mother
and relations in Humboldt. I would like, if
possible, for Ida Sofer to take my dear little
girl to take care of. But if she can't, for God's
sake please treat her kind aud good, for she is
a good child; and my poor little boy, who
ever does take him. please treat him as one of
yours. Please, for God's sake, treat them good.
J. L. Sofkr.
Tom Harper and you, Graham, you see what
yon have done? You have caused the lives
of two, me and my Dear Frankie. The way
that you done the other night caused my
blooa to curdle. I can see what you intended
to do. I ain't blind, Tom. You should not
attend to other people's business and then
there will be no trouble. I know it all, you
told me. The more I think of it the more it
makes me wild. I won't be fooled by any one.
The deceased was evidently an unedu
cated man, who hardly knew how to
write his own name twice the same way.
William Graham, who is mentioned in
one of the notes left behind by Sopher, is
a barber working in Berkeley, and who
has a room in this City, on Fourth street.
He was an early visitor at Mrs. Sopher's
bedside yesterday iv the City Receiving
Hospital.
U I am well aware," he said to a Call
reporter, "that Sopher was jealous of me,
just as he was jealous of Arthur Harrigan,
a sawmill man of Colusa. There was no
reason, however, for this.
"I met him for the first time about two
years aeo, when he was a horse-breaker,
and I subsequently became acquainted
with his wife and children.
"Sunday nighi Sopher met me on
Fourth street. He was ugly in disposition
and uncomfortably apsrressive. He came
up to me suddenly ami said:
" -Look here, young fellow, I don't want
to see you meet that woman again.'
"I answered him, 'What's the matter
with you?'
" 'Never mind,' he said.
"I told him I had not seen the woman
since I had been in town.
" 'That's all right," he replied. 'I'm
jealous of her and something is bound to
happen.'
'While Sopher was talking he pulled
out a penknife and was sawing the air
with it.
"We parted without any farther trouble
and met again an hour and a half later,
when he apologized to me for his actions.
"In the courÃeof our conversation I told
Sopher how foolishly he was acting in
making threats to kill me. I told him
also that he was placing himself in a posi
tion where I would be justified to kill him
on sight.
"He answered to that by saying, 'Oh,

Mar)- mulligan's Contest.
Mary Mulligan has filed a contest to the al
lowance of the final account of the adminis
trators of the estate of Richard Mulligan. She
claims that Peter Lynch and Thomas J. Cruse,
the executors, have failed to account for much
of the property that came into their possession
and that they have filed exorbitant charges
ior services rendered.
OLYMPIC CLUB POLITICS,
F. W. Eaton Will Not Be a
Candidate on the Opposi
tion Ticket.
He Has Grown Weary of Ingratitude.
Cycling Club Runs to San
Rafael.
President Eaton of the Olympic Club
has stated most emphatically that he will
not allow his name to figure on an opposi
tion ticket a3 a competitor to Mr. Newhall.
In fact Mr. Eaton is desirous that the
members should know that he will be in
the field to support the election of the
regular ticket. He feels aggrieved because
certain members of the club who professed
to be warm friends proved themselves
renegades at the last moment by casting
their votes against him when he was in
the field for a renomination.
"I am not grieved because of my de
feat," said Mr. Eaton, "but I do feel sore
when I think of those ungrateful fellows
who accepted, time and again, of my hos
pitality, and then when the* opportunity
came to send the knife into my back they
accomplished the trick in true professional
style. lam glad that I will have no fur
ther business to transact with such un
grateful beings, but I love men of charac
ter in whom I can rely and confide."
It Is rumored in club circles that other
than the two gentlemen who have been
named to head the regular ticket; Mathew
Weed, Len Owens and J. 08. Gunn have
been spoken of favorably as three of the
members whose names will figure on the
card for directors. Leonard Gill, in all
probability, will be selected for the office
of outdoor captain. Clem Schuster for
leader and of course H. B. Russ for treas-
urer.
There was a rumor that W. J. Kennedy,
the superintendent, was in danger of los
ing his position and salary of $175 per
month, but it was stated yesterday by one
of the gentleman who, in all probability,
will be in a position to vote on that ques
tion when th<* new officers will take their
seats, that Mr. Kennedy will not be re
moved, as his services as superintendent
have been invaluable to the club.
It has been freely reported, however,
that "there are others" who will feel the
Keen blade of the pruning iron.
Captain W. J. Black, Lieutenant
Hawelcke, James Mclntyre, Robert Black
and Al Weber, who represent the racing
contingent of the Golden Gate Cycling
Club, are going to San Rafael Sunday to
take part in races there.
Al Lewis and George Hale start for
Napa County Saturday to visit Mr. Lewis'
fruit farm, taking in all points of interest
on the way.
J. W. Miller Jr., B. Mellor and Emil
Ruhland are on a three weeks' trip
through Mendocino and Lake counties.
Lieutenant W. Madden will lead the
rest of the club on a sunrise run through
the park to the cliff.
The Golden Gate Cycling Club will give
a smoker in the near future.
The Liberty Cycling Club will journey
next Sunday under Captain White to San
Rafael to witness the xoadrace of the San
Rafael Cyclers. The members enjoyed a
good time at the club's high jinus last
Saturday evening. The committee in
charge were: William Uouton, William
Beattie, Frank lrelan, Joseph Holle and
Captain White. At the club's last meet
ing Joseph Holle was elected press repre
sentative. The club will give a five-mile
handicap roadrace on August 30. The
course will be decided later on. The
Libertys are rapidly gaining in member
snip, having elected the following new
members at their last meeting: A.
Kraeger, 412 Fell street; C. Lieb. 2654

Days.
ALL RECORDS BROKEN.
Totals for Several Fiscal Years
Beaten During One
Month.
MUCH INTEEEST INDICATED.
A Very Large Proportion of the New
Citizens Are Germans and
Scandinavians.
Between July 1 and August 4, 1896,
there have been admitted to citizenship
through the different departments of the
Snperior Court in the City and County of
San Francisco 2486 foreign-born persons.
The great amount of work which has
necessarily been involved in this has fallen
upon the courts presided over by Judges
Hebbard, Daingerfield, Hunt, Sanderson,
Troutt, Slack and Bahrs, and a compara
tively few have been admitted in the de
partments presided over respectively by
Judges Coffey and Belcher. There have
been none in the other courts. The courts
have held many night sessions in order to
get through with the business in hand as
rapidly as possible, and as many as 150
citizens have been made in one night.
The clerical work, which has fallen to the
County Clerk's office in this matter, has
been considerable. Deputy Mulcahy has
corrugated his forehead aud has been sur
prised at the number of new citizens,
bearing in mind the comparative numbers
of citizsns made during preceding perioda.
This beinj a Presidential year the inter
est naturally has risen higher than It
would during an off year, but elections in
which tne issues have been less clearly
denned have not begun to enlist the in
terest of the foreign born as has the one
in the immediate future. No citizens can
vote at the coming election who were not
admitted to citizenship on or prior to last
Tuesday. Some statistical comparisons
can be made which will be of interest be
cause they throw so much light upon the
present condition of the public mind.
The total number of naturalizations
during the twelve months ending upon
and including June 30, 1888, was 2409.
The total numDer of persons naturalized
durinz the twelve mouths ending upon
and including June 30, 1892, was 1260.
These two were Presidential years.
Of course these figures do not include
the month of July in either instance, and
it is difficult to segregate the month of
July from the succeeding fiscal year, for
the reports of the County Clerk as they
are printed in the Municipal Annual Re
ports eive only the totals for the different
years. The memory of Deputy Mulcahy
is to the effect, however, that the rusd for
naturalization during the month of July,
1896. has been unprecedented. As a mat
ter of fact more persons were naturalized
last month than have been made citizens j
during any entire fiscal year from 1888 to '
1895, inclusive, with three exceptions, as
the following totals from the Municipal
Reports will show the face to be:
Fiscal year ending Jnne 30, 1888 2409
Fiscal year ending June 30, 1889 3681 !
Fiscal year ending June 30, 1890 1074 i
Fiscal year ending June 3'J, 1891 25K6 |
Fiscal year ending June 30, 1892 1260 |
Fisea year ending June 30, 1893 4048 i
Fiscal year ending June 30, 1894 1074 |
Fiscal year ending June 30, 1895 2168 :
Fiscal year ending June 30, 1896 2400 ;
* July 1 to August 4, 1896 'i486
â¢ Approximately for fiscal year of 1895-96.
The fiscal years ending June 30, 1889,
and June 30, 1893, included the months of
July, 1888, and July, 1892, being the period
of practically final naturalization by the
Superior courts just preceding the Presi- j
dential elections of 1888 and 1892. July,
1896. and the first four days of August,
1896 lead the naturalization for the years
ending June 30, 1888, 1390, 1892, 1894, 1895 I
and 1896.
While it is impossible to classify the j
new citizens by nationalities at this time, j
the clerical work in the County Clerk's
office not being complete, the impression
is generally entertained, and a casual in- |
spection of the books containing the records
in each individual application seems to j
confirm tliat impression, that a very large j
percentage of the new citizens are Ger- j
mans, Scandinavians and English. One
man who toos out his first papers thirty
six years Â»go, an Englishman by birth, j
was made a citizen in one of the depart- !
ments of the Superior Court last week.
The outlook is that the total naturaliza
tion for the present fiscal year, of which
nearly eleven months remain, will exceed
4000. Only one year since 1888 has reached
that total, viz. : 1893, when the record
made was 4048.

413 CALIFORNIA STREET,
; SAN ; FRANCIS CO.POPULISTS ARE
IN THE CRUCIBLE,
Now Ready to Fuse With
the Effete Democ
racy.
THEIR MODEST DEMANDS,
Three Congressmen and Four
Electors the Basis of
the Deal.
DEMOCEATS WANT MB. SEWALL.
Populists Demand Watson â Some of
the Committee's Interests Guarded
by Republicans.
The leading members of the Socialistic
Labor party, whose headquarters are at
115 Turk street, are laughiag over what
they term the inconsistent and ridiculous
plight of the Populists.
"Here they are," said a socialist to a
Call reoorter this morning, "chasing the
Democratic leaders with a committee all
over the State and saying, 'Give us three
Congressmen and four out of the nine
Presidential electors and we'll vote for
your ticket and your platform. We know
we have called you rotten and corrupt
and that you are undeserving the confi
dence of the people, but then there were
no offices in sight for us. Now there's a
chance for us to get three Congressmen
and a Vice-President and we take it all
back; indeed, we do. If you'll only divide
the plunder of office with us we'll keep
our mouths shut and we'll work together
for more offices.' That is substantially
what they are saying. The People's party
have abandoned all of their principles,
many of whicli are ours, just for a little
office, and the fuaionists or unionists, or
whatever they are pleased to call them
selves, have forfeited the respect and con
fidence of the masses. They have shown
that they are more for office than for prin
ciple. Look at the difference between
them and us. The Socialistic Labor party
has fixed principles which are not wiped
out or changed at every National Conven
tion. We fuse with nobody â with no
party, no matter how good they may be,
lor with us our principles are above the j
greed for office. We expect to poll 6000
votes in San Francisco this fall and will
keep pegging away on this line until we
become strong enough to take possession
of the Government." \
The speaker's voice quavered when he
mentioned the 6000 votes, but it may have
been only a cold.
The mass of the Populists who are sim
ply good citizens and not politicians are
becoming more and more disgusted with
the action of their leaders, both State and
National. Every one of the leaders of the
National convention from General Weaver j
down spoke or worked for the nomination
of capitalist .Sewall as well as for Bryan.
Cyclone Davis was the only one shrewd
enough to see the approacning thunder
storm, and he got in out of the wet by
making a speech suggesting that the Popu
lists wanted Watson for V ice-President.
Not even Democratic Senator Jones of
Arkansas, not even Funding-bill Stewart
of Nevada, not even Anarchist Altgeld of
Illinois worked harder for the nomination
of Bryan and Sewall than did those very ,
same leaders 01 the People's party.
It may oe safely said that the Democrats
will reject all overtures of fusion unless '
they are confident that they will gain 1
more by fusion than without it. If they
think that they can elect all their Con- â¢
gressmen wiihout the People's party vote ,
of this State they&eill not make any ar
rangements with the Populists. If, how- :
ever, they think they will need the votes of
ttat party they will fuse to the advantage
of the Democracy.
t Thus far the Populists insist that in case
of a fusion on Presidential electors the '
Democratic electors must vote for Bryan ;
and Watson and turn Sewall's picture to
the wallof the First National Bank. They '
say that if the Democratic electors should
vote for Sewall, the Populist electors would,
throw Bryan down and vote for Norton.
It is not believed that the Democracy '
can accept such a proposition. It would
be treason to the party â a bolt from the
organization should they fail to support
Mr. Sewail. He is their nominee, and is '
as good a man as Mr. Bryan. It is true
that Sewall is President of a National
banK in Maine, but it is equally true that
Mr. B.yan has been and is the hired attor
ney of the Silver Mine Owners' Protective '
Association.
The People's party executive committee
finished their deliberations last Wednes
day night, and the country members left
ior their homes yesterday afternoon.
J. E. Camp, who raises hops and fruit
on the fertile American River bottom in
Sacramento County, will devote his en
ergy toward the propaganda of free silver
as a remedy against his French competitor
in prunes and other dried fruits, while
the matter of protecting the product of
the fruit-raisers in California will be left
in the hands of the Republican party.
The protection of the industries of the
American people could not be left in bet
ter bands.
John S. Dore, grower of raisins and
fruit in Fresno, will allow the Republican
party to look after his interests while he
preaches against that party in silvery tones.
C. H. Castle of Merced will do similarly.
60 will H. A. Mason.
The People's party of the State will con
tinue to be represented nere by T. V. Cator,
Joseph Asbury Johnson, E. M. Wardall
and A. B. Kinne. Mr. Cator has had sev
eral conferences with representatives of
the California Democracy on the subject
of fusion. Mr. Cator uses the word
"union," but the difference is only in the
words. The Democrats have intimated
that a combination mieht be made on
Presidential electors, the Democrats to
vote for Bryan and Sewall and the Pop
ulists to vote for Bryan and Watson, but
it is not likely that a fusion can be effected
on that basiswithout the commission of
an act of base treachery on one side or
the other. Nothing will be done in the
matter until J. J- Dwyer returns from
New York, whither he has gone to attend
a meeting of the Democratic National Com
mittee. Five of the Populist electors are
ready to resign if the combination can be
made with the once-hated Democracy.
DOWN ON HOBGOBLINS,
Dr. W. N. Hail man Would Not
Have Them Dance in
Schoolbooks.
Indian Teachers Thoroughly Enjoy
a Fine Literary and Musical
Programme.
The schoolteachers of San Francisco
took* half-hohday yesterday and went
out to the Girls' Higb School, at Geary i
and Scott streets, where, with the teachers
attending the Indian Institute, they lis
tened to an address by Dr. W. N. Hail
mp.n on "Common-sense in Education."
The assembly hall was well filled with an
audience numbering not less than 600.
Supe rintendent of City Schools Babcock
was in attendance and the platform was
occupied by little girls who sang. The
closing song was "America," and in this
the audience joined.
Dr. Hailman is the big tillicum of the
Indian teachers' convention. He is Super
intendent of Indian Schools for the Great
Father, and in the language of the tribe
which President Newberne superintends,
the Puyallups, on Pueet Sound, the ad
dress was "skookum" and was listened to
with careful attention.
Dr. Hailman expressed approval of the
Froebei aud all modern methods of'educa
tion, but he disapproved some practices
now in vogue. For instance, he told a
story to illustrate this point. Dr. Hail
man is a Swiss. When he was a boy he
was wont to roam in the valleys and over
the hillsides of his native land, and ex
plore the ruins of old castles. But he
read in school stories of hobgoblins and
fairies, and was told such stories out of
school. Aftfir that he was afraid to visit
the old castles. He said he thought it
were better to leave hobgODlin
out of schoolbooks.
During the "niv'ht off" that the teachers
took from their deliberations, which was
last Wednesday evening, Dr. Hailman,
Dr. Newberne and several others letained
a guide and dove into the subterranean
mysteries of Chinatown. .
While the speaker breathed the fresh air
of tne schoolroom yesterday afternoon he
made the statement that the modern
teacher would be the instrument that
would relieve San Francisco of such pests
as Chinatown and all cities of their slums.
Last evening 111 the Board of Education
rooms the Indian teachers enjoyed a "so
ciable" and a literary and musical pro
gramme. Most of the programme was
furnished by young ladies of the '93 grad
uating class'of the San Francisco Normal
Schoolâ Miss Edna J. Scott, Miss Grace
Sanders, Miss Mamie Carew, Miss Myrtle
Brooks, Miss Gertrude Fitzgerald and Miss
Kebe McFeeley of '96. The young ladies
captivated the teachers with their charm
ing selections.
Miss Scott favored the audience with
two fine recitations excellently rendered.
The class of young ladies and the others
on the programme received a vote of
thanks. The others who favored the occa
sion with music or a recitation were Mies
Cooper of Oregon. Miss Rita Eakestraw of
Lincoln, Nebr., Messrs. Neil and Reiso
vich, Miss Classen of the Franklin School,
Miss Edith Graves of Greenville, Or., and
Miss Grace Nickerson of California.
Nearly every selection was encored.
This is the closing day of the con
vention.
FOR THE CITY'S BENEFIT
Merchants' Association Will As

Move.
An Experiment With a Brick Pave
ment on Montgomery Street.
New Members.
The board of directors of the Merchants'
Association held its regular monthly
meeting yesterday, and besides President
P. \V. Dohrmann, there were present
Charles Bundschu, James S. Conwell, W.
G. Doane, William Doiey, uHsjo D. Keil,
M. A. Rothchild, Vanderlynn Stow and
Frank A. Swain.
The board decided to make an experi
ment in the pavement of Montgomery
street fronting the Mills building by using
the process of brick pavement in use in
many other cities. It is claimed that this
brick pavement has the merits of dura
bility, elasticity and economy. It is
believed that it will please not only the
cyclers but also teamsters. It is expected
that the results of this experiment will be
exceedingly valuable in determining what
should be used in the future pavement of
Market street. The pavement in question
is really vitrified brick, which the process
of heat renders harder than basait blocks.
It has given excellent satisfaction in
Eastern and European cities.
Official communications were read from
thirty-five clubs and associations of San
Francisco announcing the names of their
delegates to the Charter Convention to
be held at Kohler & Chase's Hall next
Wednesday evening, August 12. These
delegates, togetner with the members of
the board, will make a representative
body of eighty-five citizens. Other organ
izations have promised to announce their
delegates within a few days, and there
will be at least one hundred delegates at
the opening of the Charter Convention.
The organizations comprise those of a
commercial, improvement, labor, fraternal
and social nature.
Tlie first edition of 5000 copies of the
synopsis of the new charter published by
the Merchants' Association having been
exhausted, the board ordered a second
edition of 5000 copies to be issued at once.
This additional 5000 copies will also be
presented to the citizens of San Fran
cisco for the sole pnroose of acquainting
them with the provisions of the new
charter. This synopsis may be read in a
half hour and is freely given to all who
may inquire at the office of the Mer
chants' Association in the Mills building.
At the request of the Chamber of Com
merce and Board of Trade of San Fran
cisco the board unanimously decided to
co-operate with those bodies in issuing a
large number of pamphlets descriptive of
the great advantages of the city and port

be distributed free in all parts of the world.
It was decided by the board of directors
to co-operate with the Chamber of Com
merce and other commercial organizations
of the City to secure a belt line railroad
around the City front. This railroad will
be of great eervice to large factories in Ban
Francisco, and make the charges of trans
portation around the harbor front of a
nominal character. It is expected that
this belt line railroad will afford all the
facilities necessary for cheap transporta
tion around the City front.
The following sixteen applications for
membership in the association were elected
as regular members of the Merchants' As
sociation, making a total membership of
630:

Pope's Pay for His Iliad.
Pope made Â£5320 by his Iliad, on which
ho worked alone. By his Odyssey, after
paying Broonie and Fenton, his assistants,
he made about Â£3500. To Broomo and
Fenton he paid Â£63 for each book. Broome
did eight books, Fenton did four. I would
be pleased to translate the Odyssey at the
ratio of Â£50 a bookâ that is, for Â£1200 alto
gether. A better price is not likely to be
got to-day, and I have known a much j
smaller price offered. Pope got far more
Â£3500 for twelve booksâ but tuat was be
cause of bis name. Broome and Fenton
were not likely to get more than they did
in open market, and no publisher would
offer so much to ordinary men of leisure
to-day. If the Poet Laureate, even, pro
duced a translation of Homer to-morrow I
doubt if he would be offered Â£3500. Per
haps Lord Tennyson might have secured
that sum, for bis name and fame were
justly great in the land.â Longman's

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 1896.
IS, CRAVEN'S
STORY NEXT,
The Deposition Will Be
Taken in Her Room
To-Morrow.
THEN CHARLES L. FAIR
And Richard V. Dey, All the
Lawyers and the Com
promise Contract
COONEY FINED FOR CONTEMPT.
The Court Read Through His Deposi-
tion Word by Word and Then
He Signed It.
.Notary J. J. Cooney squared himself
with Judge Slack yesterday morning on
the charge of contempt of court that has
hung over him like a blight since that Sat
urday morning of July 11, when he failed
to put in an appearance to sign the deposi-
NOTARY COONEY ON THE WITNESS-STAND IX THE FAIR WILL CASE.
tion made by him in the quiet-title suit of
Fair vs. Angus.
He was fined $50. He explained to
Judge Slack that he had not left the City
that day, but that he did not hear of the
search for him by the officers until Sun
day morning. He had no intention of
committing contempt, he said. The case
had gone over to August 3 and he thought
it was sufficient if he came at any time be
fore that date and signed the deposition.
Mr. McEnerney asked Cooney where he
was that day. The notary declined to an
swer and McEnerny asked the court to in
struct him to do so. Judge Slack declined,
but said that the witness' refusal to an
swer would be taken into consideration.
Cooney said he would not state where he
was further than that he had not left the
City. He would, however, he said, tell
the Judge privately if he desired.
The court did not ask that the secret
be revealed to him, but said that Cooney's
explanation was not entirely satisfactory,
inasmuch as he admitted that he under
stood the court's injunction to return on
the day stated. He therefore imposed the
fine.
The court then began the reading of
the deposition, and continued through it
to the last syllable, although the lawyers
thought he might well have shirked that
duty. The reading occupied the entire
morning, and was followed closely by
Cooney ana representative attorneys lor
both sides. This deposition is, of course,
very material, as upon it the title to a
million dollars' worth of property
binges.
To-morrow morning the next and most
interesting scene of all in this great drama
will be enacted. The army of lawyers and
a notary will assemble in the sickroom of
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven out on Guerrero
street, and the answering of pointed and
personal questions necessary to the com
pletion of the deposition of this, the cen
tral figure in the play, will be resumed.
Nearly all the actors on the one aide will
no doubt be presentâ Mrs. Haskins, Miss
Margaret and Dr. Levingston.
Foil owing that the lawyers opposed to
the pencil will will be called up and
catechised. This will be commenced on
Monday morning.
Snbpenas were served yesterday upon
Reuben H. Lloyd, W. S. Wood, George A.
Knight, Charles J. Heggerty, Russell J.
Wilson, Mountford S. Wilson, Charles S.
Wheeler, Garret W. McEnerney. W. 8.
Goodiellow, William M. Pierson, R. B.
Mitchell, Richard V. Dey, Janes S. An
gus, Thomas G. Crothers, Charles Neal
and Charles L. Fair. They were required
to appear before Notary Milton S. Latham
in his office in the Crocker building and
that:
You bring with yon and produce then and
there all books, papers and writings of every
nature and kind executed or written.in whole
or in part, by James G. Fair, deceased, which
are now in yoxtx custody or nnder'your con
trol* and that you bring with you and pro
duce then and there all books, papers and
writings of every nature and kind executed or
written, in whole or in part, by Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven, which are now iv your custody or
nnder your control; and particularly that you
have then and there with you a certain in
strument made and entered into by Charles L.
Fair, Theresa A. Oelrichs and Virginia Fair,
wherein and whereby said parties authorized
and directed Richard V. Dey to settle the
claims of Mrs. Nettie R. Craven against the
estate of James G. Fair for a sum not exceed
ing $500,000, conditioned upon the probating
of the will of said James G. Fair, dated Sep
tember 24, 1894. if the same is now in your
custody.
It is expected that this proceeding will
develop the interesting and mysterious
$500,000 contract, which Mr. Lloyd said he
was willing now to show to anybody.
The lawyers will also be asked to ex
plain why a short time ago they thought
that the pencil will was just the thing,
and what led them to chauge their mind
about it.
Virginia Fair and Mrs. Oelrichs are Â«oon
to be called upon to answer these ques
tions also. Attorney Delmaa yesterday
gave notice to all the lawyers in the case
that on Thursday next he will ask the
court for an order requiring the taking of
these depositions in New York City. This
proceeding is the result of the position
taken by these ladies in their answer to
the opposition of Charley Pair to the pen
cil will as filed in court on Wednesday, in
which answer they state that they have
no information leading them to the belief
that the pencil will is a forgery. It will
be remembered that Reuben Lloyd, speak
ing for them, said, when the will was first
brought forward by Charley Fair, that
they knew that the will was genuine. The
attorneys for Dr. Levingston wish now to
learn why they are no longer confident of
its genuineness.
When 31 me. Pfeiffer Met Savages.
Her courage was remarkable, especially
in robber-infested countries, such as Baby
lonia, Kudistan and Persia. But being a
woman, she suffered little, and, though
she carried pistols, she seems never to
have required them. The Russians were
the only people from some of whom she
experienced rude and violent treatment.
Once when traveling with a caravan, and
walking aione at a little distance while the
caravan rested, she was seized by two
Russians, one of them an officer, thrown
into a car and hurried to the posthouse,
no doubt to be robbed, or released only for
a handsome ransom; but after a night of
hardship her passport set her free. "Oh.
you good Turks, Arabs, Hindoos," she
exclaims, "or whatever else you may be
called, such treatment was never shown to
me among you! How pleasantly have I
always taken leave of your countries; how
attentively was I treated at the Persian
frontiers when I would not understand
that my passport was required; and here,
in a Christian empire, how much incivility
have I had to bear during this short jour
ney !"â Blackwood's Magazine.

GILFETHER LOST
' HIS CHICKENS.
'judge Low Has to Decide
a Knotty Legal
Point.
SEARCH WARRANT CASÂ£>
Eggs Were Given to Be Hatched
Out, but the Warrant Called
for Chickens.
THIS RENDERED IT DEFECTIVE
Gilfelher Now Threatened With Arresi
for Perjury for Swearing That
Eggs Were Chickens.
Judge Low had a knotty point to decide
yesterday. It arose in the search warrant
case of Gus Gilfether, 30 Hill street,
against B. Lawlor, 1506 Sanchez street.
The point was whether Gilfether, who in
his complaint called for the production of
two game roosters, was justified in doing
so, seeing that he had only given Lawlor
the eggs.
Gilfether is a candidate in the Thirty
fifth Assembly District for the Legisla
ture, and spends most of his time around
the Police courts, where he boasts he has
a"pull." About two years ago he got three
dozen game eggs from John McLaughlin,
a special policeman in Chinatown. He
gave a dozen to his brother Frank to take
to Lawlor, who has an incubator and is
famed for hatching chickens. They all
hatched out, but all died except four.
Lawlor gave two to Frank, who took them
to his mother, and kept the other two
himself.
Gus had not been living on friendly
terms pith his parents and brother, and,
according to the testimony in court yes
terday of his brother and father, he, some
months ago, took the two chickens from
his mother and beat her. He then went
to Lawlor and demanded the two in his
possession, which are now two splendid
roosters, valued by Lawlor at $50. After
arguing the matter over Lawior told Gus
to take his chickens, but Gus refused.
Gus a few days ago went again to Law
lor and made another demand for the
chickens, but this time Lawlor declined to
let him have them. Gus then told Law
lor that he would swear out a search war
rant and get the chickens, anyhow, as he
had a big "pull."
Gus testified that he paid McLaughlin
$60 for the three dozen egg 3, but Attorney
Gallagher, who appeared for Lawlor, said
be could prove that the eggs did not cost
Gua a cent.
After hearing all the testimony the
Judge decided that as Gus had given
Lawlor eggs he could not legally make a
demand for chickens, because at the time
mentioned in the search warrant there
were no chickens but only eggs. He there
fore gave the tyro game roosters to Lawlor,
who now threatens to have Gus arrested
for perjury in swearini? that on a certain
date he had two chickens in his possession
belonging to him, whereas he only had
the eggs. ______________
MRS. STOWE IS LONDON
Her Attack on Lord Byron Offended
Some of Her Knglish friends.
Mrs. Stowe has not visited Europe since
1859, and very little bad been heard of her
since her attack upon Lord Byron in 1869,
which irreparably oamaged her reputa
tion. Mrs. Stowe made one of the great
est of literary successes with "Uncle Tom's
Cabin," but she profited but little by the
achievement. Her visit to England in
1853 was a blaze of triumph, but she
offended many of her European friends
by the revelations and comments in her
"Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands"
(published in 1854), which Macaulay
abused as "a mighty foolish and imperti
nent book." It is, however, a work which
can still be loosed through with consider
able entertainment.
Mrs. Stowe paid a second visit to Eng
land in 1856, but the trip was a disappoint
ment, and most of her quondam friends
in London utterly ignored her existence,
regarding her as obsolete and played out
Her melancholy and mortifying experi
ences during the visit caused Macaulay to
indite some weighty remarks in his diary
upon the subject of "lions."
"There is nothing more pitiable than an
ex-lion or lioness. London, I have often
thought, ia like the sorceress in the 'Ara
bian Nights,' who, Dy some mysterious
law, can love the same object only forty
days. During forty days she is all fond
ness. As soon as- they are over, she not
only discards the poor favorite, but tarns
him into some wretched shape â a mangy
dog or spavine horse. How many hun
dreds of victims have undergone this fate
(in London) since I was born! The strong
est instances, 1 think, have been Betty,
wno was called the young Roscius, Ed
ward Irving and Mrs. Beecher Stowe."â

PREPARING FOR
EARNEST WORK,
A Great Christian En
deavor Gathering Last
Night.
THE BIG CONVENTION
Delegates From Washington Tell
of the Volume of Work to
Ec Done.
THE LOCAL SOCIETIES BUSY.
The First Mass-Meeting Arouses
Great Enthusiasmâ The
Speeches.
The Central Methodist Episcopal Church
was crowded to the doors last night when
the thirty-eighth quarterly convention ol
the Golden Gate Christian Endeavor Union
was opened by President James A. Wiles.
The entire front of the auditorium was
handsomely decorated with National
colors and flowers. Two beautilul flags
were suspended from the top of the organ
pipes and were caught upon the sides In
festoons; tbe large banner of the union
hung in the center, over which was sus
pended a large C. E. monogram. The
pulpit was covered with a huge flag which
extended from one side to the other.
On the left above the gallery was the
Central Christian Endeavor banner. On
the right hung the Union Junior banner.
From the gallery was hung the letters
"San Francisco, '97."
"Onward, Christian Soldiers," "To the
Work," "True Hearted, Whole Hearted,"
and "The Banner of the Cross" were sung
during the opening.
Henry J. McCoy of the Y. M. C. A. read
the eighth chapter of Romans and led in
prayer, after which the choir rendered
"He Shall Come Down Like Rain."
Miss M. C. Lanquist made a report as
secretary, in wnich she said:
The thought uppermost in our minds for
some time has been "San Francisco, '97" â
what it will be ai/d what it will mean to vs â
ana our hearts are glad with expectation now
that the great convention will be ours.
Enough cannot be said in praise of our com
mittee of ' 97, for its untiring zeal; laboring
early and late that each day and week might
increase the amount to reach our aim of
$25,000.
To the citizens and corporations of our City,
who have so generously aided the Christian
Endeavor cause, we, tbe Endeavorers of Golden
Gate Union, tender our unbounded thanks.
We are now their debtors, inasmuch as we owe
Rev. William Rader.
to them all the Information we can give con
cerning our work from now on.
We do not want the impression to go broad
cast that all we do is to hold meetings of vari
ous sorts, but we want them to know of the
practical workings of our societies in the jails
and hospitals â our efforts for temperance,
Christian citizenship and missions. In order
to do this the press committee should receive
news from each society regularly. They can
not furnish news unless the societies first send
news to them. Would that your responsibility
could be made very plain to you on this point,
as this branch of our wo^k will be one of the
most important during the months to come.
Our fellowship committee propose to keep
all societies, especially the weaker ones, under
its watchful eye; and in the future will en
deavor to enlist the societies in the work of
visiting other societies, and the committee
hopes that any calls for the sending of visitors
will meet with a hearty response from the so
cieties called upon.
Our Juniors and Intermediates will be our
able helpers during the coming year, as the
report sent to Washington for the year July,
1895 to July 1896 will show; new- societies
organized since the Boston conventionâ nine
Junior*, five Intermediates, six Senior. They
are shoulder to shoulder with us now in
number of societies. Our Intermediates car
ried off the State banner at San Jose for the
largest increased county membership.
Our work among the seamen Is most en
couraging, eighteen having signed the Chris
tlau Endeavor pledge in the last three
montbs. S:x meetings ,have been held on
British ships and five on Government vessels;
these, together with the Monday evening
meetings and the socials given by the various
â¢oclties, tend to make life on shore pleasant
and profitable to our sailor Endeavorers.
Our launch fund has reached $342 10. Com
mittees having this in charge are actively at
work, and hope to largely increase this sum,
asthelauncb would be a great help in our
missionary work on tbe bay. Our committees
have all been actively engaged during the
past three months along routine lines. Now
that the vacation season is drawing to a close,
and our members are returning from the
mountains and scasbo/e, let us take hold of
our work for 1897 with renewed energy; let us
Kive to our Master the very best.
See that your society is well represented at
all the future executive committee meetings;
matters of great importance to you will be
continually coming up, and you should keep
yourselves informed and ready for any twd all
service.
A few days ago God called into his presence
one who has labored earnestly and lovingly,
gathering the little ones into his foldâ Mrs.
(.'. H. Tatchett, our superintendent of junior
work. Her life was one of devotion to her
Master, he who has said : "Suffer the little
children to come unto me and forbid them
not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
The treasurer, C. M. Wliitney, reported
$100 22 on hand at the last convertion; re
ceived since, $37 33; expenditures for the
quarter, $108 55; balance on hand at
present, $28 45.
Miss Cromiey read a memorial to Mrs. .
THE MEETING OF THE ENDEAVORERS IN THE CENTRAL METHODIST CHURCH.
Charles Patchett, the junior superintend
ent, who recently died.
A band of Chinese girls from the Pres
byterian Mission Home sang a song en
titled, "We are Juniors," to the tune of
"Pracious Jewels," which was heartily ap
plauded.
Rev. William Rader was greeted with
clapping of hands. He said*
We have been to Washington and returned
with the world. We met the Endeavorer and
he is ours. It is remarkable how a Christian
Endeavor convention will transform a city.
The stores and buildings were covered with
bunting. Washington is a great city; outside
of Han Francisco it is the greatest city in the
United States. Into this city we marched 40,
--000 strong and captured everybody except
President Cleveland and Dr. Talmadge. They
escaped. In the armory, on Pennsylvania ave
nue, we had the California booth, where we
had on exhibition a little common bear, Rolla
Watt and Dr. Kelley al lof the time. Every
body that came near it was loaded with litera
ture furnished by the committee of '97 and
Southern Pacific Company together.
Now 1 want you to see the White Lot. It is a
lot that George Washington saved for this
convention. It is the back yard of the United
States' domain. It was covered by three large
teivts. The California delegation was harbored
in a Methodist church, and that is enough for
you to know that they were royally treated.
He then spoke of the opening session of
the convention as reported by tbe press at
the time. He related his experience in
finding the Metropolitan Methodist
Church. As many of the churches are
known as Metropolitan, he failed to find
the right one at the right time. Of the
Good Citizenship meeting he said:
Never before in the history of the Christian
world has such a sight been seen as on the
second nfght when twenty-two churches were
filled to overflowing with the best of our land.
Then It was that the noted McArtnur made a
most notable address.
The visit to the Washington monument
was most notable, as was the singing. Every
where you went you heard the sweet strains
of hymns. In the elevators, in hotels, on
streetcars, at the depots and on the streets
whenever two or three Endeavorers got to
gether.
He then applauded B. Fay Mills' burn
ing words of condemnations of the Chris
tian nations for not interfering in the
Armenian affairs, and was greeted with
applause.
He closed with some jocular remarks
about the various denominational gather
ings in Washington and a pretty simile
of the gathering in California, 1897, which
was applauded roundly.
"Send Out Tby Light" was sung by the
choir, after which Guy W. Campbell,
president of the California State Union,
spoke upon "State for '97." He said:
I am honored, indeed, to speak to this great
union that is to be honored with such a gather
ing as that which comes to us next year. The
whole State rejoices with you in this good
news. California honors San Francisco iv
Professor James A. Wiles.
looking to you to uphold the good name of
the State. It was my good fortune to go to
Washington. When we took the train at
Chicago we were glad to find it loaded with
lowa delegates. The news soon spread through
the train and 160 strong they marched back
into our car and sang their songs. Then they
called for Â» speech. When we bid them wei
come to the Golden Gate they went wild with
enthusiasm. Wherever we appeared on the
streets we were as great an attraction as a
band of Sioux Indians. I expect to see mare
visitors in San Francisco next year than
ever came to Cal ifornla in years combined.
His remarks were received with contin
ued applause.
Dr. E. E. Kelley. an State ex-president
and who has attended two international
conventions, was introduced to speak on
"City for '97." He had just returned from
his Washington trip. He said :
We want you to be enthusiastic. We want
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 1896.
the greatest convention ever held. Our peo
ple are known for their enthusiasm and we
want to spread it to those who visit us. We
wish you, in your most enthusiastic way, to
write letters to your friends in tbe East to
come to California next year. We do not ex
pect to bring as many people to this City as to
Boston and Washington, for they have thou
sanas all arcund them.
We will expect our young people to work on
committees. A chorus of 4000 voices is one of
the committees, but only one. Every one of
us must be ready for work, hard work. We
know that San Francisco needs a great awak
ening spiritually, and we can expect a great
moral move as the outcome of this great
gathering. There is not a man, woman or
cnild in the United States that does not ex
pect to come to California some day. We want
you to enlarge your expectations.
After a song, "Arm of the Lord,
Awake," by tbe choir, J. S. Webster, ex
president of the Golden Gate jUnion and a
Â£. E. Kelley.
member of the "committee of '97," re
ported the work accomplished by the
committee thus far and what had to be
done to make tbe coming convention a
success. He said :
No church in this City has furnished so
much material for the committee of '97 as
this Methodist church. Dr. Dille is a member
of the trustees of the United Society. Rolla
Watt, one of the leaders in the work, is one of
the pillars here. Last year we had the grand
est president of the State that we ever had,
and it was Dr. Kelley, another member and
one of the hardest workers in securing the
necessary $25,000 pledge; and Thomas Hodge,
who bore the fruit of the battle.
We decided to go to Washington with a
pledge of $25,000 subscribed, something that
had never been done before, but still we lacked
one thingâ it was a question of railroad rates ;
and when we did go wa carried a pledge that
not only carried conviction to the trustees, but
gave satisfaction to all of the Endeavorers.
This we succeeded in doing, and when we got
the pledge in Washington for next year there
was no string to it.
This year's work will be a year of educa
tion, and we expect to advertise California as
she has never been before. Many of the mer
chants knew nothing of the work or conven
tions ever held. But be it said to their glory
that they turned in and helped us as mer
chants never helped in any other convention
city. Their subscriptions were the largest ever
made by business men iv any place. I want
to call your attention to one subscription of
$50 that might have escaped your attention.
It was from the Simpson Memorial Epworth
League, and goes to show the good fellowship
existing between all of our young people.
Dr. Dille then read a telegram from Rolla
Watt, who was absent in Butte, Mont.
He then led a consecration meeting, in
which he pleaded for a spirited prepara
tion. This ended the programme, which
was followed by an informal affair in the
Sunday-school rooms.
PICTURES AND SKETCHES.
A Fine Display to Be Made at the State
Fair, Sacramento.
John A. Stanton, superintendent of the
art department of the State Fair to be
held at Sacramento, in making a special
effort to display a collection of good paint
ings and interesting sketches.
He announces that pictures must be
ready for transport to Sacramento by
Tuesday, August 25. The circular ad
dressed to artists says:
No oxpen.se will accrue to you, and your
pictures will De taken from your studio or resi
dence, transported to Sacramento and re
turned to you free of charsre. The greatest
care will be taken in the handling of frames
and the packing of statures will be attended
to by experienced packers. Prizes, consisting
of gold and sflver mednUa nd cash premiums
amounting to over $700 will be distributed by
a committee of competent art judges to all
those deserving consideration for the merits
of their respective works.
Artists residing in Oakland or its imme
diate vicinity may send their pictures to
M. L. Smith & Sons, 1158 Broadway. Art
ists in Los Anszeles may send pictures to
Sanborn, Vail & Co. 133 South Spring
street, Los Aneeles. These firms will at
tend to the shipping of pictures to and
from the exhibition. Further informa
tion can be obtained by addressing Mr.
Stanton, 659 Clay street. San Francisco.
The State Fair will open September 1
and close September 19.
THE TWO FIGHTING JOES,
McAuliffe and Choynski Are
Now Talking Fisti
cuffs
Two Entertainments Will Be Given
This Month by the
Clubs.
The pugilists have grown tired of wait
ing for fat parses and are now talking
loud and hard.
A few days ajro Joe Choynski said that
he would meet Van Buskirk and Jeffries
in one evening and after Having disposed
of the former he would tackle the Los
Angeles lad, and failing to stop both he
would not ask a cent, but in case he
whipped the two new aspirants to the
heavy-weight championship he must re
ceive the entire purse.
As soon as Joe McAuliffe learned of
Choynski's sweeping challenge he boarded
a Mission-street car for this City and
quickly hunted up one of the managers of
the National Club and declared :
"I understand that Choynski is looking
for big game, and has offered to stop two
men In one night. Now, while I am in
this City Choynski will have no occasion
to meet two men in one night, and if he
is really willing to fight a man in his own
class I am ready at any time to accommo
date him, or any other heavy-weight pu
gilist, for that matter."
When McAuliffe's statement was made
known to Choynski little Joe smii' d, and
after giving the proposition some thoueht
he sent word to the managers of the Na
tional Club that he would fight McAuliffe
under the auspices of any club that would
"hang up" a good purse and a good win
ner's end.
The National Club may clinch this
match to-day, provided that McAuliffe is
not held down by the Occidental Club by
contract. He has been training for three
weeks under the supervision of Professor
Barney Farley of "wonderful-discovery"
fame, and, according to all accounts, he
is getting to look like a man.
Young Mitchell, the manager ol the
Occidental Club, states that McAuliffe has
signed articles to fight Patrick Francis
Slavin in September, and, if so, it is
doubtful if Choynski will be afforded an
opportunity of measuring arms with Big
Joe nntil Slavin will have another chance
of duplicating tnat punch which lowered
the colors of the tanner in the presence of
the sportive aristocrats of a London club.
At any rate, if the two casinosâ big and
little â cannot meet within the roped
square they will have a first-class opening
for unlimited rounds of "chin music" for
some weeks to come.
The National Club will hold its next ex
hibition at the pavilion on the evening of
the 22d inst. It has matched Billy Galla
gher and George Green and J. Stensler and
Billy Smith.
The Occidental Club will give its next
entertainment at Woodwards Hall on the
evening of the 28th inst. The only match
it has consummated so far is a ten-round
bout between "Spider" Kelly and Gns
Herget. The "Spider," who is a good
angler, is training in Niles Canyon and
has pike for breakfast, dinner and supper.
Labor and Labor Lsvi.
At a meeting of the Labor Bureau Associa
tion last evening the subject of State lawa to
govern and regulate laDor and wages was dis
cussed. It was decided to ask of State Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald copies of the bills he
is preparing for presentation to the next Legis
lature. Tnese will be discussed by the associa
tion and such suggestions made ihat the asso
ciation decides will be of benefit to the labor
ing classes.
At * recent meeting of the new Paper-hang
ers Union it was decided to close the charter
on next Friday evening. Thereafter the ini
tiation fee wilf be $5.
New Official Railroad Map.
The new official railroad map of California,
published under the auspices of the Railroad
Commission, is now ready for distribution.
It is brougnt up to March 30, 1896, and
shows the route of the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley Railway from Stockton to
Ffesno.
Ned Foster's Note.
Bamnel C. Meyer has sued Ned Foster and J.
J. Gottlob for $350, dne on a promissory note
signed by Foster and indorsed by Qottiob in
October, 1895. The vote was made in favor of
S. H. Collins, but transferred to several par
ties, and no part of the principal or interest
has been paid.
BURNED 10 THE
BONE BY WIRES,
Henry Heinze Receives a
Terrible Electric
Shock.
IT WAS ALMOST FATAL.
The Young Mechanic Paralyzed
While Removing a Busi
ness Sign.
BAD INSULATION THE CAUSE.
The' Electric Current Bored Holes
Through the Sole of One of
His Shoes.
Henry Heinze, a mechanic, about 20
years of age, living at 412 McAllister street,
was almost killed yesterday afternoon, a
few minutes after 4 o'clock, by coming in
contact with an improperly insulated
electric-light wire. He was preparing to
unscrew a sign fastened just below a
second-story window at 630 Market street.
When attempting to steady himself on
the .window-ledge he touched one of two
large wires leading from a high telegraph
pole down to the top of the ledge and
thence into the stores below.
Instantly there was a bright flash, and
as Heinze's companion, who was standing
near the express wagon waiting below,
SCENE OF THE ELECTRIC-WIRE ACCIDENT ON MARKET STREET.
looked up he saw the boy's body double
up. The hand upon the wire jerked as If
by a great effort to free itself and then it
relaxed its grip. The body fell back be
hind a large sign on the edge of the cor
nice doubled up in an apparently lifeless
heap.
So roughly was tbe unfortunate boy
handled by impetuous hands eager only to
drag him into the building that his face
was battered against tbe sill. When he
was brought within and placed upon the
floor his nose was bleeding from the care
lessness of his rescuers; one palm was
badly blackened and burned and one shoe
burned completely through the sole.
A large crowd had collected in front of
the building.
Heinze was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital and attended by Dr. Stice. His left
hand was black and swollen and burned
to the bone. There was also a large blis
ter on his right foot, and a hole in tbe sole
of his boot showed how strong the cur
rent had been to burn clear through the
thick heavy sole.
"I am a mechanic," said Heinze last
night, "in the employment ol the
Waverley Bicycle Company, 630 Market
street. Yesterday afternoon I went to the
first floor to take down tbe wooden sign.
I ooened the window and stepped upon
the sill.
''1 had just, reached out to unfix the sign
when I accidentaly got hold of an electric
wire which ran alongside the sign un
known to me. The shock was terrible. I
felt as if the whole of my body was shriv
eling up, and the pain was horrible.
Although I say it myself, I am strong, and
I tugged and tugged to get my hand away
from the wire but couldn't. I felt my
senses leaving me, and made one desperate
effort, and then I became unconscious and
fell against thÂ« window sill. I suppose
my right foot had pressed against the
ether electric wire, ana that is how my
boot was burned.
"I remained unconscious for over an
hour, but feel all right now. The insula
tion on the wire was worn almost through
and if they had been without that thin
covering I would not now be alive. I con
sider I have bad a most miraculous es
cape and I mean to see if something can't
be done to compel the electric companies
to keep their wires properly insulated."
LAUREL REPUBLICAN CLUB
An Enthusiastic Meeting Eat Coak
ley's Hall on Geary Street.
Coakley's Hall on Geary street and Cen
tral avenue was crowded last night with
the Republicans of "Laurel Republican
Club." President George R. Fletcher of
the Fortieth District presided.
After a few preliminary remarks from
the president on the duties of the Repub
licans of the Fortieth District in the com
ing campaign and their final act on the
3d day of November, Colonel J. P. Roberts
was introduced and at ones launched into
the subject of protection and the false
issue of the conglomeration of Democracy
and Populists on the silver question.
From an array of statistics the speaker
showed how the country had prospered
under Republican rule, and how during
the past four years, when the Democracy
had absolute control of the reins of the
Government, everything took a marked
shrinkage.
The tariff bill as introduced 'and cham
pioned through the HotiÂ«-e of Representa
tives by William McXi ley, was fully
explained by the gifted orator. He showed
that the McKinley tariff bill was not a bill
to increase taxation, but rather a bill to
equalize taxation, by which the rich men
of the Nation were compelled to contribute
their share of the burden of supporting
the Government.
Wilson's ad valorem bill was shown to
be one to foster and encourage perjury by
Eersons importing goods into the United
tates. all of which had the effect of run
ning the country into debt.
J. F. Gawthorn, a promising young ora
tor, showed that the coinage of silver at
16 to 1 was not a measure that would bring
prosperity to the mechanic and the labor
ing man.
He questioned the sincerity and honesty
of such silver men as Frank Newlands,

YOUNG REPUBLICANS.
They Take an Interest In the Money
Question -New Quarters.
The Young Men's Republican Club held
an enthusiastic meeting last night in
Justice Kerrigan's courtroom. There was
a large attendance and President Spencer
was in the chair.
A rousing address was delivered by C.
W. Kyle on the money question. He
said: "The stamp of the Government
simply certifies to the amount and tine
ness of the coins impressed by it. Labor
crenfes all values.
"It is the only means by which commer
iul values may bs created. Labor only
-ks employment and then that it be paid
n a dollar equal to tbe best dollar under
lie sun â a doliar everywhere and always
worth 100 cents.
"Where one product of labor is ex
lianged for another product costing the
<ume amount of labor to produce, labor is
ot cheated. When paid for in any cur-
rency worth less than 100 cents on the dol
lar, the loss falls upon labor.
"The labor of this country shall not be
crucified; on a 50-cent silver cross. De
mocracy shall not place the crowning in
famy of repudiation on the brow of~the
honest labor of the country, which they
have already cursed with idleness and con
sequent poverty and want.
"Capital may await returns for its in
vestments, but labor cannot keep the wolf
from the door unless employment be
ever at hand."
The club will soon hold its meetings in
new and more commodious quarters, being
forced to do so owing to the largely in
creasing membership.

WHAT DID CAMPBELL DO?
Mystery Surrounding the Ab
sence of the Hawaiian
Millionaire.
Guarded Now in His Room Prepara
tory to Sailing for Honolulu
Tc-Morrow.
The abduction or spree of Campbell, the
Hawaiian millionaire, during a two days'
absence from the Occidental Hotel, is still
unsatisfactorily explained.
Mr. Campbell will not talk and the de
tectives will say nothing, though they are
evidently in search of real or imaginary
malefactors.
All day yesterday the aged planter re
mained in his apartments, party because
of the enervating effect of his recent expe
rience and partly because of his wife's
watchfulness.
On Saturday, if developments in the
case do not prevent, Mrs. Campbell says
that they will sail for Honolulu on the
Monowai. it is her desire to leave for
home as soon as possible.
"Oh, I am dying to tell it all, all that I
know," said she yesterday, "but I have
been cautioned that I must not say any
thing yet. In a few days we hope to be
able to tell the whole story. I want every
bit of it to come out.
"It may be that our presence will not be
necessary to the detectives. I hope not.
They can work on without my husband's
being here. 1 want to start for Honolulu.
I think the sea voyage will brace him up.
'â¢As far as I know the detectives have
not caught any one yet."
Mr. Campbell told a friend of his yester
day that he lost $320. His captors, he de
clared, tried to get him to sign several
drafts. He absolutely refused. They
threatened his life.
The old gentleman defied them. He said
that he was getting pretty old, anyway,
and knew he had to die soon, and perhaps
that was as good a time as any. He would
be hanged, however, before he would sign
any drafts. His will was made and he was
ready to die if he must. This was the sub
stance of part of his story told to an old
friend.
Mrs. Campbell seemed surprised when
questioned about these details, and won
dered where they had been obtained. She
aid not contradict them, but repeated her
declaration that she way cautioned to se
crecy, and remarked that she was afraid
she had said too much already.
It was reported yesterday that the de
tectives had one of the men confined, and
upon his gratuitous information were
searching for the mi3sing Winthrop, with
wfcom Campbell was said to have left the
Occidental last Monday afternoon.
Captain Lees said last night that he had
absolutely no information to impart. He
believed that the story told by Campbell
was correct, as lie was a very honorable
man and would not stoop to concoct it.
He was asked if he was looking for Win
throp, but all the answer he vouchsafed
was: "Well, I haven't seen him."
The Divorce Court.
Judge Slack yesterday granted a divorce to
Olympe C. Mafille from Eocene Maflile, be
cause of the latter's willful desertion.
Emma M. Best was granted a divorce from,
George W. Best, on the grounds of cruelty, in
temperance and failure to provide. Judge
Slack made the decree. The custody of a
minor child was awarded to plaintiff.
A Peculiar Deed.
Bridget White has brought suit to annul a
deed to certain property on Orizaba street,
which deed was recorded in favor of Abby
cbamberlain on June 9, 1596. The plaintiff
claims that she never signed the deed or
caused it to be signed or received any consid
eration therefor.

Federation.
FAITHFUL TO HIS TRUST.
He Fought for the People Against
the Railroad Fund
ing Bill.
OAKLAND HAiBJR BENEFITED.
Many Appropriations Secured by Him
for His District, Especially Mare
Island and Alameda.
The following circular, urging the re
nomination of Congressman Hilborn, has
been issued by the Civic Federation :
To the Eleciorg of the Third Congressional Dis
irtet: The undersigned, a sub-committee ap
pointed at a meeting held by the Committee
of Fifty at the Mayor's office in San Francisco
to promote the election of candidates for Con
gress who are opposed ,to the passage of any
Pacific railroad funding bill, feel no hesitation
in addressing directly their fellow-citizens of
the Third Congressional District on a subject
in which all Californi-.ns are deeply interest
ed, not less those in the towns and" valleys of
the interior tuan the dwellers in the metropo
lis.; The final *truegle in all probability in
relation to the Powers funding bill will take
place at the next or short session of Congress,
â¢which will commence in December and end on
the 4th of March of next year. The object of
that bill is to roll over on three generations of
CalifornianÃ the debt due by the Central Pa
cific Railroad Company to the Government of
the United States and substitute them for the
real delinquents, C. P. Hutitingion and his
associates. The struggle is one of the most
extraordinary that has ever fallen to the lot of
any State of the American Union. It is for
that commercial and industrial freedom with
out which there can be no prosperity or ad
vancement in town or country.
The monopoly that has been created out of
the beneficence of the Government in its effort
to knit all parts of the country together is the
most grinding, the most remorseless and the
most oppressive that * has < ever ~ been set up
anywhere. The battle to compel the monopo
lists to pay their just debts to the Government
has been waged in Congress for two sessions;
first over what is known as the Reilly bill and
now over the Powers bill, which is still more
outrageous in its details. In that fierce con
test no Representative in the House from Cali
fornia has done better service than Hon. S. G.
Hiibora of your district. Not only has he
lought against the stupendous monopoly on the
floor of the House, but he. managed to enlist
in the cause of our suffering State that sterling
and independent journal, the Washington
Star, the vigorous utterances of which have
made Mr. Huntington wince.
In a few days now a convention will be held
to nominate a successor to Mr. Hiiborn. If he
should be defeated Mr. Hunungton will be
able at the next session of Congress to point to
that fact as proof that his constituents in the
seven great and populous counties of Alameda,
Solano, Contra Costa, Yolo, Colusa, Glenn and
Lake have repudiated his course in Congress.
Further, if faithful Representatives are per
mitted in this way to be sacrificed what hope
can we entertain lor the future oi honest ser
vice on the part of our public servants? Mr.
Huntington will be quite sure to look out for
the interests of his tools and agents. It will be
a sad commentary if the people should allow
those who stand up for their interests to be be
trayed and defeated. r There is a special point
in the case -of Mr. Â«iiborn, because in his
several canvasses In his district he has always
been outspoken against the enormities of rail
road domination. .
He his also by his fearless course incurred
the especial enmity of the railroad machine.
His refusal at the last political campaign to |
appear at a meeting over which the chief of
that machine presided exhibited the stuff of
which he is made.
ipart altogether from the overwhelming
question of the shifting of the railroad debt
uwn the shoulders of the people, Mr. Hilbora
deserves reaomination in a hearty and spon
taneous manner because oi his active services
:n tebsif of his district. From an examina
ii the Pwecord it appears he has been un
.- Â»:i promoting the interests of his cou
sritLieiits Among hi.s other important work
Mr. HI bora has succeeded in placing
and harbor under the continuous
- in, and secured more than
douDie the ai.nual appropriation for contract
island Xavy-yard. He had in
:. a- .Naval Commit'ee and on the floor of the
charge of Senator Perkins' bill estab- '
g a naval training school at Goat Island,
he likewise secured an appropriation ior a
>>i Val.ejo's channel prtparatory to its
â went. The naval militia owes to his
..ce the order oi the Navy Department
Piach.g the Camauche at its service for prac
tice As chuirman oi the Puulic Builuings
Committee he procured favorable action for
buildings for Oak. and, Alameda and
Woodland. The final passage of the bills on
in^-e subjects must depend mainly on Mr.
lliiborn's re-election. This is a list of distln
guUoed services that ought to secure a unani
mous indorsement ou the part of his coustitu
e?peciaily when the lines upon which
' ongrtss iueif is organized are taken into tiie
account.
lac longer a Representative serves the more
valuable he becomes. The old South under-
Mood this well enough and rarely changed its
Kepreseutatives except for cau^i. The North
iv recent years has been learning the same
iesson. We have had instances of its wisdom
in this State. A former Representative of a
part of ilr. Hilborn's present district was
elected four times, and as a result in the last
to he served obtained the chairmanship
of one of the great committeesâ tbat on Com
merceâin which he was enabled to do some
Mortal service to his State. Mr. Hilborn is now
well advanced on important committees. If
ie is continued in office he will rise to a com
manding influence in the councils of the Na
tion. There is do point of view from which
ihe closing of the career oi this faithiul Repre
sentative can be regarded with toleration. We
are satisfied that our fellow-citizens of tne
Third Congressional District are fully aware
oi mat fact.
We venture to make a suggestion or two in
the matter only becauÂ«e of the deep solicitude
whictt we feel for the success of the effort to
tecure that commercial and industrial inde
pendence without which there can be no
progress in California, in consequence of the
peculiar circumstances of the case the defeat
of Mr. Hilborn for renomination and re-elec
tion would be a blow from which it may take
a long time to recover. With the fullest belief
in your wisdom and judgment we beg to sub
bcribe ourselves your earnest fellow-citizens,

GROVE JOHNSON OPPOSED
The Congressman Accused of Vio
lating His Pledges Made
Before Election.
The following communication has been
addressed to tbe Republican Nominating
Convention- of the Second Congressional
District :
To the Republican nominating Convention of
(he Second Congressional District â Gentlemen:
On the 16th of July a meeting of the Commit
tee of Fifty was held in this City to consider
how best to aid in the election of members of
Congress who are firmly opposed to the in
iquitous scheme to refund the debts of the'
I'acinc railroads. That committee, at a sec
ond meeting held on the 23d oi July, ap
pointed the undersigned a sub-committee to
prepare en address to tbe people o! the several
Congressional districts, urging the nomination
of candidates who will resist all refunding
schemes and spare no exertions to procure the
foreclosure of the mortgages on tbe railroads.
In pursuance of that duty we respectfully sub
mit the following facts to the consideration of
the Republican nominating convention of the
1 Congressional District, which is to be
held at Sacramento on the 12th inst., to name
a buccessor to the Hon. Grove L. Johnson, who
%n present represents the district. We should
oe loth to interfere in the local concerns of
any district, but the question involved m re
'undinjris of such paramount importance to
the whole State that there can be no impro
priety in addressing you.
We do not overstep the record when it is
Eaid tbat the Second Congressional District has
oi ->n Died a unique and lamentable position iv
the present Congress on the vital question
under consideration. It has been the one con
spicuous break in the i California line on the
subject of railroad domination. At the same
time there Is no Congressional district: in the
State which has a more overshadowing I inter
est in its overthrow. The sentiment of the dis
trict appears â¢ to :â  have been > plain â¢ enough.
hen it nominated Mr. Johnson for the place
he now nils it pledged him to oppose the form
Â«J refunding that was at the time under con
sideration in Congress, known as the - Reilly
funding bill. Mr. Johnson > freely gave the
pledge exacted of him. But the Eetlly bill did 1
Â£Â£ â¢ Ome op in the session of Congress . of
which he was a member. , Another, called the
Powers bill, had been substituted tor it. That
scheme did = not get â : further than the com
mittee stage ,at the last session. But ;It
win ; come . up at , the . session which -;. will
commence in December. If the Reilly : bill
was bad the Powers bill, which has taken its
place is simply infamous. The Reilly bill
provided for the payment of the debts of the i
railroads in fifty years at the rate of 3 per cent
interest. The Powers bill extends the time in
.one case to eighty-four years : and .in the sec
ond to eighty-six years, with Interest at the
rate of 2 cent. Furthermore, the Reilly
Dill provided that in the time stated the first
mortgage bonds of the two roadsâ the Central
Â«nd Union Pacificâ be extinguished,
l he Powers bill makes no provision at all on
the subject. Of this latter measure Mr. John
son has been an active supporter in commit
tee. His method of keeping his pledges must
be said to be peculiar. He did not support
the Reilly bill, for there was no Reilly bill to
support. But he lent, according to general
report, all the stance in his power to a
measure that is infinitely worse. Of him Rep
resentative Maguire said in a speech at a pub
lic meeting in this City:
"Mr. Johnson was persistent from the begin
ning in defending the Pacific railroad people
against every assault that was made by repre
sentatives of California; in â¢ endeavoring ; to
confuse and contradict the statements of Call
forniaas, in demanding of them that they pro
duce their proofs, and in every working as
energetically for refunding as if he were a rep
resentative of the Central Pacific instead' of
being a representative of the people of Cali
fornia."
Under a defection so brazen and unblushing
there can be no possibility of the re-election of
Mr. Johnson, even if the Republicans of his
district should be so shortsighted as to renom
inate him. The Democrats of the district have
already nominated a candidate who is gener
ally well spoken of and who : indulges in no
backing and filling on : the question of
refunding. If the Powers bill, which
r Mr. Johnson boldly " advocates, had its
proper title it would read: "An act to
transfer the debts of C. P. Huntington and his
I associates to the shoulders of , the I people of
| California." The proposition is to saddle the
; latter with the $70,000,000 (less the sinking
I fund) due the General Government, the
$28,000,000, in round numbers, of first-mort
gage bonds.and the $60,000,000 or thereabouts
of stock. This is a mountain of debt sufficient
I to appall any State, and especially one so
I sparsely settled as California. If ; the Legisla
. i ture should propose to tie a millstone of that
; ! enormous weight around the ' neck of the com
; monwealth, we should soon have positive m
-1 Eurrection on our hands. , But Mr. Hunting
| ton, by the assistance of such men as Grove
1 L. Johnson, proposes to handicap our progress
1 for tnree generations by this imposition of
â  enormous debt, which we do not owe, without
as much as asking our leave. Indeed, his hire
' lings and lackeys everywhere - proclaim that it
is only anarchists and henroost robbers who
seek to balk his gentle intentions toward us.
The enormous obligations which Mr. Hunt
ineton proposes to shed were not necessarily
â  incurred in building the Central Pacific Rail
: i road. They. were incurred in a series of pyro
| technical financial operations intended solely
for his and his associates' benefit. They got 1
more money and land from the General Gov
ernment tiiÂ»n sufficient to build the railroad,
which they would have us believe they con
structed out of pure love for California. Next,
! they shoved aside the Government lien and
| issued to themselves $28,000,000 0f first mort-
I gage bonds. Out of the several proceeds they]
' constructed a railroad of their own called the
| Sunset route. To the latter, when completed,
! they leased the Central Pacific Having com
! pletely skinned the latter, it no longer pays
! any dividends. For all these stupendous mal
i versations they expect by the process known
I as funding to make the people of California
I pay, and no section of it more severely than
J the Second Congressional District. They and
their sons and their sons' sons are to liquidate
j part oi the tremendous burden whenever they
I use the railroad' to import or export, or con
â  sume anything upon which it has had a
! chance to lay its grasping hands. -
The undersigned feel 'confident that when
i the nominating convention of the Second Con
j gressional. District comes to consider these
lacts, its members will not consent to re
nominate a man who would tie the hands of
I his constituents for the best part of a century -
I with such firm ligatures that no Interstate'
j Commerce Commission or any act of; the Gov
; ernment can relieve them. With sentiments
of profound respect we beg leave to subscribe
1 ourselves, your obedient servants, â¢' '

A WOMAN BADLY SCARED
She Was Aroused by a Burly
Intruder Who Cut a Hole
in Her Tent.
Twenty Shots Fired at Invaders
of Camps Near l>.rk-
spur.
In the endeavor to capture some sneak
thievts who have been pilfering the tents
of campers in Baltimore Canyon, about a
half mile from Larkspur, Wednesday
evening about twenty shots were fired, and
at least one man was hit by a bullet, as
the traces of blood he left behind him
show.
Larkspur is a very popular camping
ground for those who desire a summer
outing, and this summer about 100 tents
are pitched there. There are in all nearly
1000 persons in the little white city.
For about a week the campers have
j missed various sums of money, valuable
! pieces of jewelry and other small, portable
1 articles. The amount of coin lost in this
; manner aggregates more than $200, to say
i nothing of the other things taken.
In many cases the tents have been slit
with a knife to afford ingress and egress.
j As a result, the women and children have
j been in a state bordering on hysterics for
several days.
I Weanesday evening a lady named Craig
rushed from her tent, screaming that a
man had just cut a larte hole in the tent
close to vrnere she lay in bed. Several
men seated at a short distance round a
fire at once rushed toward the tent, but
1 the invader had fled. His footfalls and
j the crashing of brush indicated the direc
j tion in which he was running.
The men at once rushed to their own
tents for arms, and headed by William
Maxwell with a revolver, a gentleman
named Martin, who possessed a shotgun
heavily loaded with buckshot, and Robert
D. Duke, armed with a small parlor rifle,
at once made off in active pursuit.
The fleeing men, for the thief haa evi
dently been joined by several companions,
headed their course up the canyon. At
one time they were surrounded on three
sides. Then it was that the shooting
began. The pursuing posse at this junc
ture had several narrow escapes from
shooting one another in their excitement.
However, the thieves managed to escape
in;o tbe hills. Diligent search next day
revealed traces of blood on the ground
and bushes where the shooting had oc
curred. Nothing to reveal the identity of
tbe thieves was found.
Last night several of the gentlemen in
camp sat up all night waiting for the
thieves to return. Evidently they were
satisfied with their experience of the night
before for no one showed up.
It is believed that the malefactors are
wandering peddlers, many of whom have
lately been seen in the vicinity.

councils during most of the last sun. The
weightier questions of tribal government,

those which have troubled the great chiefs
most sorely, had largely* been disposed of
and the business of the day was mainly
the regulation of such minor affairs as
commonly engage the attentions of the
tribes' chosen men.
The new meciical certificate was among
the matters which engaged the attention
of the council. After considerable discus
sion It was decided to refer it to the ad
visory board with power to act. All de
cisions made by the great sachem during
the great sun were approved.
Five new tribes were admitted into the
order, charters being granted as follows:
Shawnee No. 83, Woodland; Pottawatomie
No. 84, Hay wards; Kiowa No. 85, San
Francisco; Minewawa Council No. 17, de
gree of Pocahontas.
Considerable interest was manifest in
awarding the $100 trohpy for the best ren
dition of the adoption work: before the
Great Council on Tuesday evening. The
demonstration of Modoc Trfbe No. 57 was
decided to be the most meritorious, but
MRS. HATTIE A. YVHIPPLE, ACTING GREAT MINKEHAHA,
resolutions were adopted voicing the ap
preciation of the Great Council upon the
excellent manner in which Arapaboe and
Montezuma tribes performed the work.
A question having arisen as to the limi
tation of the finance committee's power it
was decided that the committee had a
right to examine the records at any time.
A proposition to recommend a condensa
tion of the degree ritual was defeated.
The minimum weekly sick benefit was
placed at five fathoms (dollars).
In the council of the Daughters of Po
cahontas tbe "rising sun" was devoted to
listening to the wisdom of the great chiefs
as embodied in their reports and in dis
cussing the propositions advanced for ihe
good of the councils. At high sun they
joined the braves and together they posed
for a photograph.
Durine the setting of the san the
Daughters discussed the proposition to
have a State charter of their own and be
independent nf the beneficent guidance of
the great sachem. A vote showed that
such a course was not favored and the
great sachem will continue the protector
of the Daughters of Pocahontas.
At nightfall tbe pale-faced braves and
their fair companions assembled at Union
square Hall. They had about completed
their labors, and the evening was to be
devoted to making merry. The entire
auditorium of the hall was occupied with
long tables at which sat about 300 mem
bers of the orders, and guests. At the
head of the tables tat Master of Cere
monies Past Sachem F. D. Brandon and
Past Sachem Edward Conolley, chairman
of the banquet committee.
After the discussion of an elaborate
menu, tbe master of ceremonies proposed
the toasts and announcea the responses as
follows:
"Great Council of California," Great Sachem
A. Jackson; "Our Sister Societies," C. F. Mc-
Glashan, P. &; "Great Council of the United
States," Past Great Sachem B. F. Josselyn;
"Degree oi Pocahontas," Great Cnief of Records

Elect Josiah Sims; "Visiting Delegates,"
James J. Bullock, P. S. ; "The Kising Genera
tion," Charles A. Reynolds; "Our Sister Dele
gates," Great Pocahontas Miss Mabel Curtis.
Much of the success of the banquet was
due to James Hagan, who assisted Mr.
Conolley on the banquet committee.
This "rising sun" the council fires will
be lighted for the last time tni3 year. The
main business before the Red Men and the
Degree of Pocahontas is the advancing or
installation of the chiefs and tbe selection
of a meeting place tor tne next council.
The latter proposition has not been ex
tensively discussed yet, though many
places have been suggested.
The council drawing to a close is consid
ered by members and representatives one
of the* most successful in the history of
the order.
"ELLA D." DISCOVERED.
The Author of the Letter to the
Coroner TVu Ella David
ton.
The mystery of who "Ella D." is that
wrote the letter to the" Coroner saying that
her body would be found in the bay at the
foot of Filimore street is possibly cleared
up.
Late last night two ladies called at the
Central police station and said that a
young girl who gave the name of Ella
t>avidson had disappeared from 647
Stevenson street, where she had been
lodging since Saturday.
They described her as 5 feet, 3 inches
tall, dark hair, dark eyes, slim figure, and
21 years of a c.
One of the young ladies said: "The
girl came to our house last Thursday and
engaged a room. She had only a hand
sate el with her. She seemed in great
trouble and was naif crazy and hysterical
with grief. Sue spoke of having been be
trayed and was in a delicate condition,
just as described in the letter to tbe Coro
ner. We did not notice the letter in the
papers till to-night.
"She left our douse about 3 o'clock Sat
urday afternoon, taking her hand-satchel
with her. As she was leaving she was
heard to say, 'Well, I know how to end it
all.'
"She did not say where she came from
or who her friends were. All she told ua
was that her name was Ella Davidson and
that she was 21 years of ace and in trouble.
"The sign 'Rooms to Rent' is outside
our house and I suppose that is why she
came there, thinking it was a quiet place."
The envelope which contained the letter
to the Coroner bore the date August 5, so
that if the girl was Ella Davidson she
mast have lived somewhere between Sat
urday afternoon and Wednesday, the day
on which the letter was posted.
MADE COOD THE LOSS.
The Emporium Manager* Fay the Debt h
or the Absconding Janitor.
The board of managers of the Empor
ium decided, at a special meeting held
last evening, to pay the wages of the em
ployes of the absconding head janitor.
Brooks contracted to do the janitor work
on the Emporium building for a stated
sum per month, and hired such men as
he needed to perform the service. Many
of the men have families dependent on
them, and actual want was staring them
in the face through loss of their July
wages.
Tbe generous action of the Emporium
managers, who had already paid out the
money to Brooks, and who were in no
manner responsible for the men's wages,
was gratefully appreciated by the rascal's
victims.
A few days ago W. F. Brooks, head jan
itor of the' Emporium, skipped out with a
considerable sum of money that he should
have paid to the men under him.
Convicted of Grand Larceny.
Al'ce Nathan, who has two prior convictions
against her, was yesterday convicted of grand
larceny in Judge Bahrs' court. She will be
sentenced August 15.
REDDING MINERS
AT LOGGERHEADS,
Trouble Occurs Among the
Owners of the Alta
Group.
FORGERY IS CHARGED.
Clyde H. Williams, W. N. Rob
inson and Attorney Robert
Ash Arrested.
ALL EELEASED OK BONDS.
Claimed That City Attorney Charles
H. Braynard of Redding Is at the
Bottom of the Business.
Clyde H. Williams, # secretary of a min
ing company owning the Alta group of
mines in Shasta County, was arrested yes
terday afternoon by Constable Eldridge of
Redding on a Justice's warrant charging
him with a felony, out there was nothing
on the warrant to show what the felony
consisted of. The complaining witness
was A. W. Graham, president of the min
ing company.
There were also warrants in the con
stable's possession for the arrest of W. W.
Robinson, treasurer of the company, and
Robert Ash, attorney for the company.
Attorney Ash at once applied to Judge
Slack for writs of habeas corpus, and tney
were made returnable before Judge Bahrs
to-morrow. Their bonds were fixed at
$1000, which were promptly forthcoming.
"This is a trumped-up charge," said At
torney Ash last evening. "We are charged
with forgery, but there is nothing in the
world to base the charge upon.
"Mr. Robinson has been here for some
time with the object of negotiating a sale
of the mines to a new corporation. John
C. Simons, the capitalist, who died the
other day in New York, was arranging to
pay off the indebtedness and buy Gra
ham's interest. Unfortunately his death
put an end to that, and we wired to Gra
ham, asking what to do, and he replied to
go ahead and make a new deal.
"Charles H. Braynard, City Attorney of
Redding, has been using his influence
upon Graham to get him to place the sale
of the mines in his hands, and our arrest
on the charge of forgery is the result.
The forgery is alleged to consist of chang
ing the name of the deed to the new cor
poration. It is typewritten, and how
could it be forged ?
"I have in my possession documents
that will bear out every word that 1 have
said."
According to Williams there is another
reason for their arrest.
"Robinson and I," said Williams, "are
witnesses against Braynard in a criminal
case against him which will come up in
the Oakland court to-morrow morning,
and Robert Ash is the special prosecutor.
"Braynard is charged with grand lar
ceny and I am the complaining witness.
About tbe end of June I wa- the victim of
a footrace to the extent of $500. The race
was between Ryan and Mills alias McDon
ald, and took place in Shell Mound Park.
It was a fake and I was out $500. I blame
Braynard for putting up the job on me.
"It seems to me he had Graham influ
enced by some means or other to swear out
the warrants for our arrest on this trumped
up charge, so that when his case came up
to-morrow laorning we would not be there
to sive our testimony. But we will be
there.
"I am exceedingly surprised at Gra
nam's action. Robinson and I own two
thirds interest in the mines, and we have
consulted in everything regarding the
formation of the new corporation. Every
thing we have done has met with his ap
proval, as letters and telegrams in Mr.
Ash's possession will show."
WITHDREW THE DELEGAES
A Big Break in the Ranks of
the Building Trades
Council.
Two Large Carpenters' Unions De
cided to Attend to Their
Own Business.
The Building Trades Council sustained
a heavy loss last evening by the with
drawal of the delegates from Carpenters'
and Joiners' unions Nos. 22 and 483.
Upon assembling C. W. Page and Harry
Sauuder of Union No. 22 announced that
they had been withdrawn from the coun
cil, as well as K. H. McVicker, who was
cot present.
George McCloud, John Graham and A.
0. Aithur of ho. 483 made the same state
ment, and the five left the room. Arthur
was the secretary of the council, and J.
W. Rose of the Paper-hangers' Union was
selected to fill the vacancy.
Tne delegates who withdrew represent
about 1200 carpenters, and from ail ac
counts the delegates from No. 304, tne
amalgamated and the Italian unions will
also be recalled. There were several
reasons for this action on the part of the
carpenters. Under the by-laws every
union, great or small, is allowed three
delegates, yet the unions were assessed by
the council for running expenses at so
much per capita.
Thus the large unions, like 22 and 483,
stood the bulk of the expenses and had no
more voice in the proceedings that the lit
tle unions. Last month the council's call
upon 22 was for $120 and upon 483 for $47.
Another cause was on account of the
Lathers' Union, which the carpenters
stated caused nearly all of the recent
stakes. As a fact the carpenters gave the
council to understand that if ti.e lathers
were not requested to leave the council the
carpenters would withdraw.
The council did not have any excuse for
taking such a course, the latuers having
lived up to all obligations and refused to
comply with the demand. And last night,
but not least, the slangier question, re
peatedly explained in The Call, was an
other excuse for the carpenters desiring to
go bythemselves.
C. W. Page has already been appointed
walking delegate for the carpenters, and
on Monday morning the district council
will issue new working cards to its mem
bers.
The reason for believing that the other
three carpenters' unions will recall their
delegates from the Building Trades Coun
cil is because each of these unions is
bound by the very nature of its exist
ence to the District Council of Carpenters
and Joiners, and it is not likely that the
three named will serve two bodies between
which the relationship is somewhat
strained.
The officers of the Building Trades Coun
cil, however, do not intend to let the with
drawal of the unions mentioned interfere
with its plans, but will continue upon the
same lines originally laid down.
After the foregoing matter was settled
at lasteveuinje's meeting the next question
taken up was a grievance presented by the
Painters' Union. It was a complaint
atrainst the contractors who are painting,
whitening and tinting the fifty-eight
schoolnouses of this City. The contract,
so the complainants stated, requires the
contractors to scrape and wash the walls
and ceiling down to the plaster. In many
places as many as eight coata of whiten
ing have been put on, one on top of an
other.
The painters state that this work is not
done, but that the whitening is plastered
on tbe walls over old coats of dust and
the accumulated germs of disease uf many
years. Special complaint was made of
Contractor John McKey and Architect C.
I. Havens, who, they say, should see that
the work is done properly. The painters
say they have sixty witnesses to the facts
set forth. A committee was appointed to
call the matter to the attention of the
Board of Education or to the Grand Jury
if the boara does not act wim promptness
in the premises.
New Corporations.
The Queen of Sheba Gold Mining and Devel
oping Company was yesterday incorporated
by George H. Helmore, O. C. Wilson, W. F.
Drake, James McMullen, J. G. Boyne, H. R.
Hurlbut and M. J. White. The capital stock Is

A. O. Stevens, W. A. Horack, Frank 11. Hall,
Jacob Stadtfeld Jr. and C. H. Morrell have in
corporated the Comanche Gold Mininu Com
pany, with a capital stock of $500,000, $200 of
winch has been subscribed.
The firm of Sway ne & Hoyt was incorporated
by Robert H. Bwayne. JohD G. Hoyt, F. F. G.
Harper, Robert J. Woods and Edward J. Bailer.
$100,000 is the capital stock. $2500 of which
is subscribed.
Mrs. Howard's Will.
The will of Dr. Rebecca A. Howard was yes
terday filed by William K. Brown, executor.
Brown resigned his trust, the heir of testatrix,
Kate A. Howard, having attained her majority.
THE NEW VELODROME.
An Auditorium With Seating
Capacity for Twenty-One
Thousand People.
Structure to Ba Finished for the
Thanksgiving Football
The Velodrome to be established on the
land of the Van Bergen estate near the
panhandle of Golden Gate Park will
largely increase the amusement resources
of San Francisco.
It was noted in The Call yesterday
that the Velodrome Company had been
incorporated by J. D. Giobs, Cress Un^er,
J. Buckman, X Calisher and William H.
Chapman.
Speaking of the proposed establishment
J. D. Gibbs, one of the leading promoters
of the enterprise, yesterday said that
ample capital was available. Tbe plan to
lease the land and inclose a large area for
amusement purposes and speed contests
was formed some time ago, but the de
tails were kept as nearly secret as pos
sible until the articles of incorporation
were filed.
A space 400 by 275 feet will be inclosed
and a seating capacity for 21,000 people
will be provided. There will also be ac
commodations for 1100 horses. A lease of
the land for seven years has been taken
with an option to extend it for a second
term of seven years.
The main feature of the Velodrome will
be the inclosure of the area of land and
the construction of a roof of glass and iron
over all the inclosed space. It is pre
sumed that the roof will be constructed
on the cantilever principle, as there will
be no supporting columns to mar tbe
speed tracks or obstruct the' view of tbe
audience.
The work of building the structure will
be pushed forward rapidly so that the
Thanksgiving football game may take
place at the Velodrome, from which point
live car lines radiate.
In aue time negotiations will be opened
with the Olympic Club for the privilege of
putting in a pipe to connect with the j
main pipe from the ocean which supplies i
the club with salt water.
The Velodrome Company proposes lo !
offer rooms to each bicycle club of San
Francisco on certain conditions. It will ]
be possible for every wheelman to keep
his wl|eel there and have his bicycle Buit I
in the locker. When it is desired to ride â¢
through the park tbe wheelman can step i
aboard the streetcar, go to the Velodrome, j
don his bicycle clothing, make the run
through the park to the ocean, return to j
the Velodrome, take a bath, change
clothing again and return home.
Under the present conditions the salt
water bath taken at Sutro's is in the
middle of the drive, whereas at the Velo
drome the salt water bath will come at
the finish.
Uiider the great roof there will be a six
lap tiack for bicycles, a straicbt-away
track of 100 yards, a handball court, riding
academy, lawn tennis court, cafe, a vast
auditorium and a spacious stage.
From the East and Europe amusement i
directors have telegraphed for opportuni- j
ties to present novel attractions. A com
bination scheme of scenic railway and !
chutes, which has proved immensely ;
popular in Paris, may be secured. The
facilities for presenting novel entertain- .
ments on a large scale have been provided
for in the plans. It is said that Willis
Polk has been engaged to prepare the i
designs and superintend the building of
the structure. A lease to Sebe & Green
for advertising privileges nas been effected.
Tbe terms of the contract are such that the
Velodrome Company has cash to begin
work without selling stock. It is surmised
that the Market-street Railway Company !
is interested in the project.

OUTLOOK FOR WINE.
The circular of the Gundlach-BunOscho Wine
Company of Sonoma says:
"We take rleasure in reportiug that the Califor
nia wine trade shows a marked improvement upon
its abnormally distressing condition of the past
few years. Ihe tendency of going from bad to
worse has been legitimately aid effectively
checked by increased demand and reduced sup
plies From many causes the vineyards of Cali
fornia have not of late yielded the overabundant
supplies of former years,
'â¢Immense sacrifices In values have most effec
tually diminished the once heavily accumulated
surplus stocks, at the same lime so stimulating
consumption and popularizing California wines
that their future is brighter than ever bsfore and
the increase of prices well sustained.
â¢â¢Early frosts in April, followine an unusually
open winter, have proved most disastrous. Un
precedented warm weather in February and March
started the sap of the vines considerably ahead of
tne season, while a prolonged cold spell in April
cheelcpd their growth so seriously that the wood of
many of the younger vines appears in a very bad
way" even for our next vintage. Lowland vine
yard's suffered more than those in higher alil
tudes. bm the frost effects are very irregular and
"Some locations and certain varieties have lost
their entire crop. Where the frosted shoots were
speedily removed, the development of the dor
mant eye promises still some uncertain result.
In the northern counties the end of June barely
carried the vines through their blooming season.
Complaints are now coming in about damaging
heat effects, and everything points to an unsuc
cessful year for our grape growers. No definite
calculation can. therefore, be made as to this
year's vintage, either as to quality or quantity.
"Tbevteldof dry wines (clarets and hocks) is
vnriousiv estimated at H. 000,000 to 12,000.000 j
gallons, which wili be lar from sufficient to replen
ish stocks or provide for the contingencies of our
expanding markets.
â¢ . he production of sweet wines will necessarily
be curtailed, and under the strong hand of our con
solidated sweet-wive makers prices will be stronger
than ever before.
â¢â¢Under these conditions the question of replant
ing vin. yards on resistant roots has lately been
consideraDl v abated by the vine-growers of Napa
and Sonoma counties aud o her phylloxera
iDiested districts 1 new methods of plaiitins and
grafting are recommended : the selection of varie
ties and soils is bi-ing discussed, and under the
leadership oi experienced growers satisfactory re
sults m.\y be expected. Many vineyards will be
re-established that have been destroyed b disease
or abanuoaed for financial ri-asons. It will, how
ever, require many years before new supplies of
wines can be derived from these effort*.
-The Associated t.iower; hH\e strengthened their
posuion br a more judicious system of handling
their product, and the necessity of forcing swcks
upon ihe market at unwelcome times has disap
peared; a certain independence is well sustained,
and c jnridecce restored where formerly depression
ruled unrestricted. The harmony now existing
b-tween wine-growers aQ d wine merchants gives
encouragement to hope that the present improved
conditions of our young home Industry will be per
manent."

but when the "lew" is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "Men" in the vicinity of Idaho, Â»nd
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be oxDocted m summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these condition* |
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORlt. : N. .Y.; /â¢ Ann. T 6.â Stocks to-day
were ac'.ive and weak, the ' trading reaching 245,
--150 shares,' an unusually large 'â¢ total. The heavi
â¢ness of ' the .'"market { was due primarily to ; the
activity of the bear leaders, who, in the absence of
bull support, are practically in control of the 'cur-'
rent " speculation. At â  the 'â  opening ; London . sold
heavi! of Louisville and Nashville and other
stocks dealt in ab,oad. The selling of the Western
stock was attributed to reports of damage to crops
in the -Northwest, while Louisville; and, Nashville
was depressed by the poor ; traffic ' statement : for
July, just published. .- â '.'â ': : ; . â  . . .â â¢â â¢"â¢-â .
Following the selling of Louisville and Nashville
there was an attack on ; grangers, Manhattan and
Western Union by local operators. Burlington and
Quincy of late was the objective-! point and the
stock made a new low record, coming down to
67%. It was again stated that the directors will
be compelled to reduce the dividend on .< the stock.
'1 he same argument was made in the case of Man
hattan and the stocK i dropped %. The break in
prices dislodged consiJerable long stock and shift
ing of loans followed as a natural result and forced
sales added to the depression and disturbed confi
dence among marginal holders generally. â¢ Money
on time also worked closer and â¢ higher rates were
predicted. â  '.'.'. â¢ . ' .â '"" '"â â  â  ;.'/â¢â . â  vi â¢â -:>â '- â :, ,

. CHICAGO, , ii,i,. Aug. 6 Heaviness was the
principal feature attending the wheat trade to-day.
A disposition on the part of traders to remain pas
sive Is further added to by the uncertainty attach
ing to local money affairs just at present. 1 A num
ber of : well-known- professionals frankly stated
that they will remain inactive until the affairs
connected with Diamond Match and the Moore
Bros, .embarrassment - assume a more defined
.â¢â nape. The weakness of wheat prices to-day was
ascribed' to this and also to the depression which
wan prominent in corn. Receipts were fair at 151
cars for Chicago and 627 In the Northwest. The
latter section had 317 last Thursday and 87 a year
ago. . Liverpool cables were steady. â â¢ , â  .* , - ; â¢
The Cincinnati Price Current reported a slight
lowering of the average condition of the crop. Lo
cal Inspections from store amounted to 6700 bush
els. About noon New York stock prices began to
evince treat weakness, which fact exerted impor
tant influence on wheat, additional declines taking
place from this cause, i Closing continental cables
were generally lower. Export clearances amounted
i to 327.920 bushels. The Kansas State report plac
ing the yield for that State at Â£9,000,000 bushels
was without effect as a firming factor. September
wheat I opened from I 58>&c to 5Â«y 2 c, declined to
56ysc, closing at 56% c,' 2c under yesterday. 5 Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow 195 cars. '
COKNâ The corn market came to the front a*
an Interesting affair this morning. Right at the
opening a bear raid was made and prlc s slumped
quickly, receiving little support from any source.
September was apparently the weakest option, the
selling of that month being the most noted. Good
crop report*, - the I Cincinnati ( Price ! Current sum
mary, coo er weather. in corn States and liberal
receipts. 719 cars, were all urged m : explanation
of â  the weakness. - Liverpool . cables were steady.'
Withdrawals I from store amounted to I 362,800

vailed throughout tue session. Export clearances

â¢ OATSâ The action of prices in this ; market was
alike to that of those in corn and ' was ; ruled to a
large extent by that grain. ,â > The business wan not
brisk,- however,' trade being without incident.

OUT OF OFFICE,
Lively Contest for the Pres

Club.
ONLY TWO CANDIDATES
The Club Has Entered Upon a
New Period of Pros
perity.
MAY SOON CHANGE QUARTERS
A Handsome Building Now Being
Erected on Which It May Take
a Long Lease.
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 5. )
The Acme Club having passed through
what one of its directors called "a siege,"
has now entered upon a period of pros
perity and every effort is being made to
insure its continuance.
The event of greatest interest at this
time is the choice of a president. The
only two men who have been placed in
nomination are Judge J. J. Allen and
Thomas F. Garrity. There cannot be said
to be a contest on hand, as each candidate
is anxious that the other shall accept the
honor. Colonel Garrity has said definitely
that he would not accept, but it was at
Judge Allen's request that he entered the
NEW HOME OF THE ACME CLUB.
fight, so there is still a small doubt as to
the result-
Judge Allen was president of the club a
year ago and is very familiar with the or
ganization and its needs. It is thought
that if he will consent to act again it
would be better than electing a new man.
The past year has been a hard one, but
the policy of retrenchment that was in
augurated some months ago has proved
beneficial, and as the club is expecting to
move into its new building the coming
year renewed interest is being shown by
the members.
"The club has passed through its crucial
period," said Judge Alien to-day, "andfs
in first-class standing. I am anxious for
Mr. Garrity to accept the presidency. I
have been accorded the honor once and
am satisfied. The club will undoubtedly
continue to add to its high standing in
athletic circles and, in my opinion, an
energetic man like Mr. Garrity should be
elected.'"
Colonel Garrity is not sager for the
presidency and says that Judge Allen,
having had one year's experience, is the
proper man for the place and wants to see
his friend elected.
In the meantime the fight to keep out of
office is quite lively.
The plans for a new building are for a
3VÂ£-story structure in the Venetian styie.
The facade will be finished in stone and

terra-cotU. The entrance will be twelve
feet wide, leading to a mosaic tiled ves
tibule. A wide staircase leads to the
second floor, where will be all the '"living"
rooms of the club. Extensive arrange
ments are made for offices, library,
sitting-rooms, billiard and card rooms and
cafe, as well as lockers, dressine, bath and
rubbing rooms, showers and needle baths.
The third floor will be devoted to the
gymnasium, 50x100 feet in the clear. On
the half floor above will be a gallery, with
running track and handball court.
The bicycle annex in the basement will
have an entrance on an incline from the
eidewalk and will include an ample
storage-room and repair-shop. There will
be a swimming-tank 12x30 feet and six
teet deep in the basement.
The interior finish will be in California
yellow pine, with tinted and decorated
walls.
NOT YET PERMANENT.
Rev. Owen Jones IÂ« Acting Assistant
Pastor to Ur. Coyle.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 6. -The an
nouncement in The Call t this morning
that Rev. Owen Jones had been appointed
assistant pastor of the First Fresbyterian
Church created much interest in church
circles.
Although Mr. JoneÃ is now at work,
there are certain rules to be followed before
his position is made permanent.
"According to Presbyterian forms," said
Rev. O. Jonea to day, "before a pastor can
be elected, there must be a regular con
gregational meeting. In this case, there
has not been one. My position is this,
that Dr. Coyle has asked me to assist him
just for the present, and the arrangement
is altogether a temporary one. if you will
kindly give mention of this, it will nelp
to remove the misapprehension which may
have been caused by the article in question,
as of course there was not the slightest
intention to mislead."
HEALTH OF THE CITY.
Facti Taken From the Board of Health's
Report.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 6.â The annual
report of the Board of Health of this city
shows the death rate for the fiscal year,
ending June 30, to have been 12.03 as com
pared with 12.05 last year and 12.65 in
1894 This is based on an estimated popu
lation of 60,000.
This mortality record shows 47 deaths
from zymotic diseases, 164 from constitu
tional diseases, 377 from local diseases, 83
from developmental diseases and 51 from
violence.
Dr. F. E. Pierces repori as City Veter
inarian is included in the report. Re
garding the inspection of dairies and
milch cows he says:
After spending nearly three years in the in
spection of mi'ch cows, and having an oppor
tunity to see many suffering from tuberculosis,
I have come to the same conclusion that many
of our leading veterinarians have; that it is
an impossibility to diagnose the disease in the
early stages without tne aid ot tuberculine.
Some may say there is no danger incurred by
using milk from an animal suffering localized
tuberculosis; but the question arises. How are
we going to know when it becomes general
without the aid ol tuberculine? We can teil
only when the animal exhibits a cough and
presents an emaciated and pinched condition.
And with good feed and care the animal may
be suffering from generalized tuberculosis for
many months before presenting these condi
tions ; so, I see no other way but to follow in
the footsteps of many other cities and require
all dairy cowd to be subjected to the tuber
culine test.
WILL OPPOSE All RAISE.

Assessor Dalton Furnishes Some In*
teresting Facts Regarding County
Assessments.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)|
908 Broadway, Aug. 6. f
No word lias yet been received from the
State Board of Equalization regarding the
report that the Supervisors would be cited
j to appear and show cause why the assess
-1 ment ol the county should not be raised
this year. Assessor Dalton, when seen re
garding the matter yesterday, said he
felt that such action would be taken and
added:
"The last assessment of Assessor Leckie
was made in 1894 and amounted to $90,
--824,944. This was reduced by the County
Board of Equalization just $32J0, leaving a
total assessment of $90,821,744. The State
Board did not cite the county to show
cause why the assessment should not be
raised.
"My first assessment was in 1895 and
amounted to $94,083,282. This was re
duced by the county board by $1,873,735,
leaving a total of $91,832,822 after deduct
ing $376,725 of State mortgages, which
were nonassessable.
"This year my assessment amounted to
$94,768,740 and it was reduced by the
county hoard by $2,443,646, leaving an as
sessed valuation of $91,824,194. This year
there is $500,900 of State mortgages, which
leaves $124,175 more in State mortgages
than last year. That leaves a net gain of
assessable" property in the county of $115.
--647 over 1895. The gain of 1896 over 1894
is $1,126,625, aad there is no one, not even
the State Board of Equalization, who dare
say that valuations have increased in this
county to that extent, as the values of
real estate have decreased fully 25 per
cent daring the two years."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 1896.
CHARITY DAY'S SUCCESS,
The Exposition Will Probably
Be Kept Open a
Month.
German Singing Societies and the
Turn Verein Will Appear To-
Night.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cal
JX3B Broadway, Aug. 6.
The Associated Charities will reap a
rich harvest from its benefit at the Exposi
tion. Large crowds filled the grounds
during the afternoon and night, and the
singing of the scores of little children
from the West Oakland Home daring the
aiternoon was greatly admired.
It is probable that the Exposition will
be maintained for a month.
"We are having favorable weather and
the crowds are constantly increasing,"
said Superintendent CraLie Sharpe. "Our
expenses are larger this year, but the at
tendance is also larger. The doors should
certainly be kept open a month alto
gether."
"While it may not be any greater suc
cess from a financial standpoint than last
year's Exposition," said M. J. Keller,
one of the directors, to-day, "it is cer
tainly drawing crowds, and as the people
want it continued longer than the conces
sionaires want it, we probably will follow
out their wishes. What pleases the peo
ple pleases us. The crowds are constantly
increasing and many people are taking
advantage of the season tickets to visit
the exhibition every day. Personally I
am in favor of its continuing for at least
another week."

NO MORE "FRATS."
Ei-I ditor Ketchum of the High School
JEgis Was a Students'
Benefactor.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 6.â Tnere are to
be no fraternities in future in the High
School. When Willis Ketchum, a lad of
poor degree, was elected to the editorship
of The JEgis, some months ago, the mem
bers of the fraternities, who are generally
the boys of high degree, raised such a pro*
test that eventually Ketchum was ex
pelled. A3l sorts of reasons wer? given
for his expulsion from the High School,
but the impression still remains that if
Ketchum had worn broadcloth instead of
jeans; be would still be in good standing
as editor and scholar.
The fraternities at th*s High School have
been the means of fostering a bitter class
feeling, and so much was this the case at
one time that children who could not
afford certain luxuries| were frowned
upon and made to feel their straitened
circumstances.
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.
Harry Oubrldge Charged With Attempt-
Ing to Dispose of Another's

Missionary Work in China.
A writer on the "Far Eastern Question,"
speaking of missionary influence in China,
says: "Missionary work is practically the
only agency through which the influence
of western civilization can at present reach
the masses. The missionary alone goes
out into the byways, as well as the high
ways, and, whether he resides in a treaty
port or in some remote province, Btrives to
five with and among and for the people.
Tne life which he lives, whether it be the
ascetic life of the Roman Catholic mission
ary or the family lile of a ProteÃtant
missionary with wife and children, is in
itself a standing reproach to the life of
gross self-indulgence led by the average
mandarin. But in the eyes of the latter in
becomes a public scandal when, iv glaring
contrast to every vice of native rule, the
foreign missionary in his daily dealings
with the people of bis district conveys a
continuous object lesson of justice and
kindliness, of unselfishness and integrity."

DENY THAT THEY
ARE FOR BRYAN,

in Arms.
PRODUCE SOME FIGURES.
Only Fifty Veterans in the
County That Are Not
Republicans.
QUARTERS FORMALLY OPENED.
Officers Chosen From the Host Stal
wart Protectionists to Be
Found in the County.
Oakland Office San Feancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 6. j
There is trouble in the camp of the army
and navy veterans. A circular has been
Headquarters of the Army and Navy Republican League That Were Formally
Opened Last Mght.
issued announcing "Veterans in Line for
Bryan," and the Army and Navy Repub
lican League deny that such is the case.
The circular reads as follows:
We, the undersigned, veterans of the late
Civil War, do hereby form ourselves into an
organization to be known as the Bryan Free
Silver Veteran League, and we pledge
ourselves each to the other that we will exert
ourselves in every honorable way to secure the
election of W. J. Bryan as President ot these
United States, and the enactment by Congress
of a law for the free and unlimited coinage of
both gold and silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.
Among those who have signed are C. N.
Hitchcock, E. M. Gibson, J. B. McMatb,
A. J. Gregg, E. M. Cannon, E. H. Wool
sey and Calvin B. White.
Colonel McElroy and Major Woodward
are particularly incensed at the assump
tion that the veterans are for Bryan.
Major Woodward said to-day : "There are
about 1200 veterans of the War of the Re
bellion in Alameda County, of which num
ber, so far as a careful canvass shows, just
sixteen are for Bryan.
"The Army and Navy Republican
Ler.gue of Oakland has enrolled 315, and
its membership is increasing daily. The
Alameda League has enrolled 150, and so
far as heard Ironi not a single old soldier
in Alameda will vote for Bryan. It may
truthfully be said that not more than fifty
veterans out of 1200 will vote for Bryan.
The remaining 1150 are all shouting for
McKinley.
"Our officers are all tried Republicans.
Judge J. P. McElroy is an oldtime Repub
lican and one of the best organizers of the
State, and to him in a great degree is due
the credit of this star club of the State.
Colonel George Babcock is one o# the
ablest and most eloquent speakers in the
State and ought to be made available
everywhere in the State. He is a prime
favorite with the old soldiers. He organ
ized the league in Alameda and is an
earnest Republican."
The league formally opened its head
quarters to-night on Eighth street, near
Broadway. The decorations are very
handsome and in exquisite taste.
The next meeting of the Young Men's
Republican League will be held Friday
evening, August 7, in Army and Navy
League Hall. Congressman Hilborn and
the Hon. A. L. Frick will address the
league on the issues of the day. Follow
ing the address an important business
meeting relative to the drill corps, for
which the league will furnish uniforms,
and the election of drill corps officers will
be held.

the year.
The grand president's report expressed
more than satisfaction with the present
condition of the society and full confi
dence in its future.
The consideration of proposed amend
ments to the constitution commanded
much attention. Tne constitution seemed
so satisfactory to the members, however,
that but few changes were made, and
these were of minor importance.

the late George R. B. Hayes, past grand
president of the society, were adopted.

to a close with the election and installation
of the following grand officers: Grand

gellon, Daniei Cronin, John Ryan.
The grand officers intend to strengthen
existing assemblies and organize new ones
in every parish. Permanent headauarters
will be established in Loyola Hall at
Tenth and Market streets.
The society was organized in San Fran-
Cisco in 1887. George R. B. Hayes was Its
first grand president. His successors have
been William P. Sullivan Jr., P. Moiloy,
E. P. Luby and P. N. Hanrahan.
The society gave a very successful
course of lectures during the year. The
object was to explain the teachings of the
Catholic church in regard to the rights and
duties of citizenship. Among the lecturers
were: Rev. P. C. Yorke, Rev. T. Carraher.
Rev. W. D. McKinnon, Rev. J. W. Rior
dan, S.J., and Rev. J. P. Ferguson.
The next grand assembly will be held in
San Francisco in August, 1897.
FAVORS WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE.
A Wyoming Supreme Justice Who Be
lle yea In Its Extension.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 6. â Justice
Charles N. Potter of Cheyenne, Wyoming,
a member of the Supreme Court of that
State, is the guest of Mr. ana Mrs. Joseph
Ireland of 644 Pacific avenue, Alameda.
He has been on the bench two years.
Regarding woman suffrage he said:
"There is very little difference in the
percentage of men and women who vote.
Fully nine-tenths of the women who are
eligible to vote avail themselves of the
privilege. They must have the same
qualification as males, among them, of
course, being that of education. The
voting of women is a benefit to the State,
and the people see nothing disagreeable in
the practice. Women are independent in
their political views ana less likely to be
partisan m politics than men, though
some of them are among the strongest
partisans.
"There are comparatively few instances
of a division in political sentiment be
tween husband and wife. The fact that
wives vote as their husbands does not
argue that they are coerced, but that they
harmonize their convictions on that sub
ject with tneir husbands as on other
equally important domestic questions.
There are slight efforts made to traffic in
women's votes, but not as much as iv
men's. With over twenty years' expe
rience with female suffrage I can say I
believe in it thoroughly and hope to see it
adopted in other States."
Porter Has His Pistol.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. &â Louis Por

TIGHTENING THE SCREWS
More Stringent Requirements for
the Students at the
University.
Barnes and Scoggins, the Crack Sprin
ters, Retnrn to Berkeley.
N?ws Notes.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 6.â Recorder
Sutton of tLe State University announced
to-day that the faculty had passed on two
new regulations, which will raise the
standard of entrance requirements for spe
cial students, and also tighten the screws
on the students already in college.
Last year all applicants desirous of taking
liberal studies in the various colleges, un
der the head of special students, were re
quired to pass an entrance examination in
English composition, while this year ap
plicants for admission to the university
courses in English must pass the entrance
examination in subjects one and fourteen,
as provided for in the list of entrance
subjects.
The rule of last year will hold as regards
students who wish to take courses other
than English.
The other regulation requires that at
the end of every year students shall have
a preponderance of second sections in their
favor or pass examinations sufficient to
bring their standing up to the mark. By
passing this measure students will be re
lieved of the embarrassment attending the
discovery at tne end of the fourth year
that they have not enough second sections
and hence cannot take their degrees.

MOTIVE OF A BURGLAR.
Had His Hand on Jewelry and
Money but Departed Without
Taking Them.
Mysterious Action of a Man Who Was
Discovered by Two Ladies in
Their Room.
Oaklanp Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aue. 6. J
Mrs. M. Wilder and Mrs. R. Schultze,
who reside at 461}Â£ Twenty-first street,
are wondering why a strange man was in
their room at an early nour yesterday
morning.
The two ladies are sisters, and both
their husbands are away from home. In
the middle of the night they were aroused
by the presence of a man iv their sleeping
apartment. He carried no light, but the
rays from an electric light enabled every
thing to be seen with distinctness.
The burglar spoke to the ladies when he
saw that they were both awake and asked
them where they kept their jewelry and
silver plate. He intimidated them by say
ing that they would not be harmed if they
told him where he could find anything
valuable that might be in the house.
The women told him and then they both
bid-their heads from fright. They beard
the man go downstairs and look around
in the parlors and finally he went into the
street. As soon as be had departed Mra.
Schultze opened the window and at
tracted the attention of an officer.
An examination of the house showed
that nothing had been taken. While talk
ing to the ladies in their bedroom the
burglar had one hand on the bureau in
which were the ladies' rings, watches,
brooches and purses, but be did not touch,
them. He had entered by the front door,
but hiÃ quest, it was inferred, was not
booty.
The matter has been carefully looked
into by the police, but no trace has yet
been found of the burglar. Mrs. Schultze,
Mrs. Wilder, their husbands and the police
are eager to know the reason ot the
burglar's visit and if he intends to re
peat it.

A COHTEST IS IK PKOSPECT.
Strange Story of Love, Courtship,
Death and a Rig Inheri
tance.
A romantic love story which will, in all
probability, end prosaically in the law
courts, came to light in the County
Clerk's office yesterday. Mrs. Henrietta
Kosengarden filed for prooate the will of
John Cameron Simonds, a New York at
torney, by the terms of which will the
entire estate of the testator is bequeathed
to Mrs. RosenEarden. The legatee is a
typewriter, with an office in the Crocker
building, and was Simonds' fiancee. She
is referred to in his will as about "to be
come my wife."
The will is a peculiar document. It was
written entirely by Mrs. Kosengarden in
her office, she says, at the dictation of Mr.
Bimonds. After reciting the usual pre
liminaries and providing for the payment
of his debts, the testator says:
I hereby {rive, bequeath and devise unto
Henrietta Rosengarden, now of San Francisco,
Cai., who is to become my wife, all my real
and personal estate of whatsoever name, kind,
nature or description, of which I may be seized
or possessed at the time of my death, to wit:
All the real estate, tenements and heredita
ments of which I may die seized ;â¢ all the per
sonal property I may possess at my demise;
goods, chattels, stocks, bonds, notes, bills and
credits, unto the said Henrietta Rosengarden
absolutely forever.
If, after my death, the cash value of my real
and personal property should amount to not
less thsn $125,000, 1 hereby request my afore
said legatee and devisee to give unto the fol
lowing-named persons the sum of $5000 each,
viz. : Martha Shaw, John T. Patey, O. H. Gil
more, Angus Simonds and Maiy Shaw White.
Then follows a paragraph which re
quests Mrs. Rosen garden, in her will, to
divide the property remaining in her
hands at the time of her death, equally
between her grandchildren and the chil
dren of testator's brothers and sisters,
Watson, C. W. and Angus A. Simonds
and Margaret A. Arthur.
The will goes on to say :
I leave all the above bequests and suggested
testamentary disposition aforesaid, to the fair
ness, justice, generosity aud remembrance of
my wishes of the said Henrietta Rosengarden,
hoping and believing that she will comply
with my wish as fast as practicable for the
maintenance of such estate as I may have at
my death.
I hereby constitute and appoint the said
Henrietta Rosengarden, A. W. Poole and C. W.
Simonds executors of this, my last will and
testament
Bonds shall be required neither of my execu
trix nor of either of my executors.
The document is dated May 16, 1896, and
signed by John Cameron Simonds and
witnessed by William H. McDonald, John
Barnett and A. N. Hungerford.
Mrs. Rosenearden, A. W. Poole ana C.
W. Simonds are named as executors of
the will, but the latter has declined to
serve. The will was filed for probate by
the first two named.
There is a rather romantic story behind
the whole matter. Mrs. Rosengarden is
a widow who formerly conducted a steno
graphic school on California street and
later in the Crocker building in this City.
She has two daughters, one of whom is
now living with her. The other was mar
ried about three years ago to Charles How
ell, a young newspaper man. He is now
in Chicago, where he conducts an insur
ance paper.
Mrs. Rosengarden met Mr. Simonds
about a year ago, and their acquaintance
soon ripened into love. They were en
gaged to be married, when Mr. Simonds
was called to New . York on business.
While there be became ill and sent for his
betrothed. She at once responded, and
was with him when he died.
Theie will probably be a contest over
the will. The instrument was drawn in
Mrs. Rosengarden's office, in the Crocker
building, and was written entirely by her.
The brother of the testator named as
executor declines to serve as such, which
would indicate that he is not altogether
pleased witn the transaction.
Mrs. Rosengarden resides with her
daughter at 1432 Geary street. She was
not at her office yesterday, but her
daughter was carrying on the business
and refusing to talk for her mother con
cerning the matter.
"This is all very painful to mother," she
said â "the death of Mr. Simonds I mean.
He was to have married my motner you
know, and she wants as little said about
the matter in the newspapers as possible.
There is nothing indeed to be said about
it. The will speaks for itself, it was made
by Mr. Simonds just before his departure
East. He ana my mother have been
engaged for some time, and that is the
whole story."
The document as filed is backed with
heavy colored paper bearing the business
inscription of Mrs. Rosengarden on the
outer side. It was placed in the safe
deposit vaults when Mr. Simonds went
East. After his death it was sent to New
York where it was duly probated and then
returned here, and yesterday it was filed
with the County Clerk.
The surviving relatives of the deceased
who are likely to contest the will are Wat
son Simonds and Angus Simonds of New
York, C. W. Simonds of Thousand Island
Park, N. V., and Mary A. Arthur of
Rochester, N. Y.
THE STOCK MARKET.
rbe Comstocks were steady enough during the
early i art of the day, but weakened off on the af
ternoon call, as will be seen.
The official let er from the Savage mine, under
date of August 1. say*: On the 850 level the north
prospecting drift from the fifth floor of the upraise
in east crosscut 3 was advanced 42 feet, when it
intersected tho south prospecting drift from the
fifth floor of tbe noun upraise, which wag
advanced 43 feet to the point of intersection.
These drifts passed through porphyry and quartz.
Thia connection gives good ventilation to prospect
this section of the ledge, and crosscuts will be
started for that purpose during the week. The
main south drift is advanced 75 feet. The face is
In quartz. Eas" crosscut 3 is advanced 36 feet.
The face Is iv porphyry. The upraise In east cross
en t 3 has been advanced up to the â¢ twelfth ' floor.
From this upraise we have extracted 2 8 cars of ore.
The car samples averaged $23 60 per ton. m On the
760 . level .- the v east crosscut . from i the - main

which point the west wall was encountered. They
then started a west crosscut on the seventh floor
and struck the west wall in 7 feet after uncover
ing 6 feet in width of quartz. Assays from it ran
from $B to $9 per ton. On the 1100 level they are
still opening on the seventh â  floor, from which
point they have extracted so far and stored in the

averaged $32 12 per ton. The formation in which
the ore Is found continues very hard. â â¢â â â  :
In the Mono mine for the week ending August 1
the east crosscut from the south drift on the 400
level was advanced 6 feet in I hard porphyry and
stopped. The track : and alrpipe have been re
moved and work has commenced laying the track

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGCTST 7, 1896.
WANTS HIS WIFE
SENT TO CHINA,
Lee Fong Says His Better
Half Was Fraudu
lently Landed.
ARRESTED FOR ROBBER
The Woman in the Case Tells
Quite a Different
Story.
SHE WAS SOU) AS A SLA'
The Wife, Di Toy, Is Now Stopping
Temporarily With Friends
in This City.
.Lee Fons;, a Chinese merchant, wants
his wife, Di Toy, sent back to her native
heath. He declares that she was fraudu
lently landed at this port something over
four years ago, though he naturally dis
claims having any hand in the unlawful
proceedings.
The trouble between Fong and his wife
dates back several months. Di Toy is said
to be a comely Chinese woman, over whose
head only twenty summers have passed.
The story goes, according to Fong's
friends, that some months ago she was
lured from the home of her lord and mas
ter, and under promises of great wealth
was induced to cast her lot with some dis
reputable Chinese of Fresno.
For a long time Fong could not find her,
but some weeks ago word reached him
that she was in Fresno. He at first tried
peaceable measures, but without avail.
Then he remembered a burglary which it
is alleged she committed, and without
further ado swore out a warrant in Judge
Campbell's court.
Without any great trouble and with no
formality whatever, the unfaithful Di Toy
was arrested and later brought to this
City. Her trial has been set several times,
but for some unknown reason, as often
postponed. It is still pending.
Within the last few days Lee Fong has
been seized with a desire to assist the
Government in its attempt to strangle the
fraudulent landing of Chinese. He has
not as yet had the temerity to see the Col
lector of the Port on the matter nearest
his heart, namely, the deportation of his
wife, but he has clandestinely approached
the District Attorney. That gentleman
refuses to raise a finger on the ground
that such action would be antagonistic to
the Chinese Bureau, the latter office claim
ing the sole right to first pass on any
Chinese alleged to be subject to deporta
tion.
There is another end to the story, how
ever. The diminutive Di Toy claims that
her husband tried to sell her for immoral
purposes in Los Angeles. She finally es
caped, only to be recaptured at the end of
a few weeks. Fong then carried his wife
to Fresno, whence she again escaped, com
ing to this City, where she was sheltered
by the Presbyterian Mission. Working
from Fresno Fong endeavored to have his
wife arrested for embezzlement. Chief
Crowley, however, refused to allow the
woman to be taken back. Then, she says,
Fong tried the roobery charge, which is
still pending. Di Toy claims that her
husband is anxious to sell her to parties in
Victoria, and that the present movement
is simply an attempt to get her back to
China, and then send her by the next
steamer a slave to Victoria.
In any event the position assumed by
Fong is most peculiar. If his wife was
illegally landed at this port four years aeo
it is reasonable to suppose that the mer
chant and husband was aware of the an.
lawful proceeding. The case is one wor
thy of close investigation, and Collector
Wise will probably immediately institute
the proper inquiry.
In the meantime Di Toy is at the house
of Sou Lea. She never ventures out alone
for fear of being kidnaped. She dreads
Fong, and is in hourly terror of some
bodily harm.
A MOUNTAIN THAT MOVES.
French Peasants Hear It Groaning and
Roaring as It Journeys On. .
A mountain is moving down in the old
Provence district of France. In what Ions;
ago used to be known as the '.'Land of j the
Troubadours," this modern miracle has
come :to pass, and before the eyes of : the
astounded , peasantry, who are . hurrying
to and fro to their wayside shrines and
ancient churches, a great ? mass of earth
is moving at a rate that is plainly percepi
ble %> the eye, and with a noise that groans
and .. roars : up and down the valley of the
Gard. >. 'â â â ;. 'â  - ' . '.- f.V--' â  â  .â â -â \.y:' 'â 
' It is likely. to ido 1 even ' more. There tis
more than a possibility that this gigantic
movement .of - :â  beaped-up \ boulders and
loosely joined together soil will ?. result iin
changing the course . of s the 'â â â  famous i river
Rhone. Already the ' colliery ?of Grande
Combe, in the village "â¢ of the ; same * name,
and the best part of a mile of the Allias
Railway have been destroyed, and the
dwellers in that region have had to flee be
fore the mountain's slow and irresistible
advance. ' ; '. â¢ â Â" x ':""''
The I entire movement ~Z is strange i and
peculiar. One reads of the transformation
of tho earth's surface which took | place , in
past ages, but such an event has not been
known to happen 'â { hitherto in these times
of ours. ; The s primal cause of j this moun
tain's moving is said to be the weakening
of its base of . grit : and green marl by the
continual infiltration of rain. .
The 3 lower 5 portions of j the enormous
mass of soil and boulders have given ?< way
and the whole vast bulk, which until now
had lifted its head high above the valley,
is gradually slipping C: down 5 toward 'the
far-off sea, threatening to choke up both
the Gard; and 1 the Gardon rivers, : which
mingle and flow down to the f Rhone
through the valley along which the moun
tain is making its way.
Many people are traveling out from near
by Nimes each day to obtain a view of this
phenomenon. As i many $as if 5000 -f sight
seers have already visited the district,' and
great care has to be >. taken that none of
them venture on S the mountain f itself,
or in the path of the moving mas.-. : :
As it moves and the advance is almost
perceptible, as * one \ stands : and watches
closely, 5 the ? noise s is deafening I- and \ time
and time again with a sound like a muf
fled explosion Â£ the surface jof .* the moun
tain side breaks f i into > great cracks and
crevasses, some of which are wide enough
for a railway train to pass through. -

THOMAS J. WALSH'S STORY.
James H. Barry's Friends Will Make
a Fight Against His Congres
sional Rival.
Trouble is brewing in the Fifth Congres
sional District over the nomination by the
Democratic convention of Joseph P. Kelly
for Congress, and the embroglio promises

to be of the most bitter kind before elec
tion day arrives and the voters are ready
to cast their ballots. Kelly was only nom
inated after a redhot tight against James
H. Barry, in which the strength of both
candidates was brought out to its fullest
extent.
Now Barry's friends claim that the
nomination was obtained by fraudulen
means and that Kelly's name will not
appear on the ticket when election day
comes. They claim that had the conven
tion been carried on in the proper manner
Barry would have been nominated and
that the man who apparently received the
approbation of the delegates only received
the nomination tnrough a forged proxy.
Previous to the convention there was a
great scurrying around among the friends
of the two candidates, Barry and Kelly,
for the proxies of those who would not be
able or were unwilling to attend. Among
the former was VV. C. Hanly, a hardware
n:an, who was prevented from taking a
part in the proceedings of the convention
by business that took him out of town.
Previous to leaving he gave a written
proxy to Thomas J. Walsh, a clerk in the
White House, and instructed him to cast
the vote for James H. Barry, should the
editor be placed in nomination, under
other circumstances to vote as he deemed
best.
When the vote was being taken at the
district convention Walsh voted Hanly'a
proxy for Barry, but the vote was immedi
ately challenged by Kelly's friends, and a

man named Wilson arose in the rear of
the nail and claimed tbat he held the
only genuine proxy of W. C. Hanly and
that all others must be foreeries.
He produced a typewritten proxy, pur
porting to nave been signed by Hanly,
and the two proxies were taken by the
leaders of the" convention into an execu
tive session that was immediately held.
The proxy held by Wilson was declared
to be tne genuine one in spite of the ob
jections of the Barry people, and Kelly
was nominated by a vote of 49, the lowest
number that could have accomplished tnat
object.
The friends of Barry believed that Kelly
had been nominated by underhand means
and searched high and low for evidence.
Their efforts were unavailing until yester
day, when W. C. Hanly was interviewed
by a representative of the Barry faction.
He declared unequivocally that he had
given a proxy to no one but Walsh and
that his representative had been instructed
to vote for Barry and no one else.
Furthermore, he declared that at the
time he was claimed to have been with
Wilson and to have signed the second
proxy he was at home and in bed and that
he could prove it by a number of witnesses.
Immediately on receiving this informa
tion the attention of the executive com
mittee of the convention, of which Eugene
Deuprey is the chairman, was called to
the matter, and he and Max Popper started
on a tour of investigation. Up to a late
hour lact evening no report had been ren
dered by the investieators, but Barry's
friends had decided on one thing â a de
termined finht against Kelly.
An attempt will be made to prove that
Kellv's friends used fraudulent means to
gain his nomination and that the same is
void. If this is successful Barry will still
be in the rieht. If Kelly cannot be taken
off the ticket Barry's friends will combine
against Kelly anyway and try to prevent
his election.
Whichever way the cat jumps the prom
ise of a big split in the Democracy of the
Fifth District is assured and a lively fight
will be the result.
WILL BUILD THE ROADS,
T. S. Bullock, Al Stetson's Asso
ciate, Returns From
Arizona.
Expected a Business Telegram and
Received News of the Suicide
Instead.
T. S. Bullock, the railroad operator and
builder associated with the late Al Stet
son in their prospective Yosemite line,
returned to the Palace yesterday from
Arizona, whither he went a few days be
fore the suicide occurred.
"I left here on Monday," said Mr. Bul
lock. "Mr. Stetson and I parted the best
of friends. He came down to see me off.
We had made a proposition to the Yosem
ite people. Stetson was to telegraph me
their answer. The first word I received
after that was that Stetson had committed
suicide on the Friday following.
"That there was any disappointment in
regard to my part in the proposition is
entirely untrue. I stand ready yet. lam
stil! willing to build the Yosemite road.
My offer is open. I think that Stetson
must have talked with Miss Amy Head
about that Yosemite road, otherwise she
would not have been able to say anything
about it.
"1 came out here first from New York
in connection with that railroad from
Stockton to the mother lode. Then I got
into this Yosemite proposition. Those
are two independent propositions. I stand
ready now to carry out one or both of
them according to my original terms."

Jease C. Fruchey Commits Suicide by
Inhaling Illuminating Gag.
Jesse C. Fruchey, a native of Ohio, 69
years of age, and a salesman by occupa
tion, committed suicide in his room, 418
Minna street, yesterday afternoon by in
haling illuminating gas. The body was
discovered last evening at 7 o'clock by
Sarah J. Fruchey, widow of deceased,
upon her return home after an absence of
several hours.
Fruohey had not seen much of life's
eunny side. For years he had been strug
gling against an incurable disease.
Fruchey had taken no chances. With
an old newspaper he had stuffed every
chink and crevice of the door and win
dow, turned on the gas Â»nd laid down to
die. The old salesman had looked over
the field and decided that the chances
were against him, and calmly made prepa
rations for death.
Yesterday moraine he visited the paint
store of G. Hummerup, 1314 Market street
where he formerly worked. His old em
ployer had told him not unkindly that he
could not take him back as he was not
strong enough to work. Fruchey knew
what that meantâ there was no hope for
him. He went home, and in a well
worded letter to his wife told her that he
would "take the short cut across lots,"
and be did.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, AUGUST 7, 1896.
MODERN BUILDING
FOR SOUTH PARK,
A Beautiful Design in Span
ish Style of Archi
tecture.
STORES AND TENEMENTS
Modern Features in Plumbing,
Light and Finish In
troduced.
TENANTS READILY RESPOND.
â¢
James D. Phelan the Builder and
William Curlett the
Architect
In the early times of San Francisco,
South Park was the center of culture an d
refinementâ the home of the rich and the
pride of the ar istocrats. In the develop-
ment of the metropolis, the home-builders
who were favored with great riches sought
the hills and thereon built mansions.
Still South Park retained its pride and
much of its exclusive luster. It seems
now that some of its lost prestige is to be
restored, although at the coat of modern
innovation.
James D. Pbelan has decided to build at
the southeast corner of South Park and
Third street a three-story structure, fash
ioned in the style of Spanish architec
ture. The land on which tne edifice is to
be erected has a frontage of 137 feet on
Third street and a depth of 45 feet on
South Park.
On the first floor there will be six stores
facing Third street. On the floors above
there will be eight flats or tenements â
four in the second and four in the third
story.
The flats will be modern to the very
date, containing the latest wrinkles in
sanitary plumbing, the best facilities for
bathing and the regulation convenience
for supplying gas and electricity.
The duty of designing the structure de
volved upon the architect William Cur
lett, and the sketch here presented was
drawn from his plans by a Call artist.
When Mr. Phelan was first taken with
the fancy of erecting the building at
South Park be deemed it best to have in
quiry made as to prospective tenants.
When the architect's plans were un
folded the demand for fiats and stores was
instant, and so without further hesitation
the decision was made to award contracts
and go right ahead with construction.
The building will present several fea
tures very agreeable to the eye. The
pitched roof, in Spanish style, of the South
Park elevation, and the angle and center
bay-windows, together with the wrought
iron balconies, add to the beauty of the
extension. The material of the structure
above the foundation is to be wood, but
it will be finished to resemble brick and
stone plastering.
South Park, as a pleasure ground, has
been incorporated in the system of munici
pal parks, and its maintenance is no longer
a charge on the property-owners in that
immediate locality.
WILL AWAKE ONCE MORE
The Alcazar to Open Again
Under New and Energetic
Management
The Managers Determined to Make It
Rank First as a Place of
Amusement.
The Alcazar Theater, that has been
sleeping and full of shadows since the
latter part of June, will soon awaken into
light and life.
Since Manager Drover's assignment
there has been a blank place on O'Farrell
street between Stockton and Powell.
Hereafter the old Alcazar will be itself
again. It has been leased and will be
managed by Frederick Beiasco, brother of
Dave Beiasco of Leslie Carter fame, Frank
Doane, the well-known and popular East
ern comedian, and J. B.Jordan, a business
man whose reputation extends from
British Columbia to San Diego,
i The new managers express their inten
tion of catering to the public taste in
plays, companies and prices.
Messrs. Beiasco & Doane intend to
produce society comedies and dramas by
the best authors, in fact, a whole round,
according to their assertion, of the best
dramatic works, both musical and literary
of the present decade.
The opening will be announced later
and will probably be in the first week of
September. In the meantime the theater
will be put in the hands of painters,
decorators and scenic artists. The pro
ductions will be under the management of
Mr. Beiasco, who has held a long connec
tion with toe Charles Frohman company
and with the "Heart of Maryland" and who
was stage manager of the Grand Opera
house of this City during Frederick Burt's
management
Miss Amy Lee has been secured for the
position of comedienne. Miss Lee has
been connected for years with Harrigan
and other prominent companies.
A strong opening play has been secured,
the name of which the management will
not divulge.
"Every effort," said Mr. Doane, "will be
made to place the Alcazar where it be
longs. We are not swine. We do not
want it all; we simply desire to have our
theater classed as one of the best in town.
Every week there will be a change of tal
ent, and we hope that our years of experi
ence In the histrionic profession will be
productive in adding another important
factor to San Francisco's amusement
places.
"The Alcazar is a closer counterpart to
the Casino in New York than any play
house I have ever played in. We have the
plant here and we intend to give the people
of this City something that they will con
sider worth their money."
Sued for Damages.
Alfred Emery, who, on July 26 last, was ar
rested on a charge of petty larceny, preferred
by the proprietors of the Golden West Hotel,
has sued Fred P. Plageman et al. for $5250
damages for alleged malicious prosecution.

NOT A LEPER
DUMPING GROUND,
San Francisco Won't Take
Refugees From Other
Counties.
MENDOCINO MUST PAY.
Responsible for the Support of
Lena Grimm in the
Pesthouse.
SHE HAT YET BE SENT HOME.
The Board of Health Will Take a Stand
Against Unloading Lepers in
This City.
A rather nice question has come up for
settlement between Mendocino County
and the City and County of San Francisco
over the case of Lena Grimm, the little
leper, now an inmate of the Pesthouse, out
on Twenty-sixth street.
The health authorities claim that a prin
ciple is involved In the matter which calls
for immediate settlement. It is this â if
San Francisco must receive leper patients
from all parts of California and support
them for an indefinite period, without
ever receiving assistance from the county
whence the afflicted one comes. In addi
tion to this point, the present question
suggests again the proposition to estab
lish a State lazaretto for the care and
maintenance of lepers, as offered by phy
sicians and local improvement clubs.
This, however, in the Grimm case is a sec
ondary consideration.
' The point directly involved is whether
a leper from Mendocino County must be
an expense to San Francisco County. As
in the case of Lena's young brother, who
was recently sent to the City and County
Hospital, but escaped and was then re
turned to Mendocino County, this dispute
may end in the transfer of the afflicted
girl to her former home at Ukiah, or at
least to the Mendocino County infirmary.
About three weeks, ago Lena was de
clared by the Mendocino physician to be |
a leper, with the result that she was hur- !
ried out of the county just as fast as the j
o fficials could provide her with transpor
tation to San Francisco. Her father has
a small ranch a few miles from Ukiah,
and he lived there for about three years.
So he was a citizen of the county and a
taxpayer there. When it was discovered
that his young daughter was stricken
with the horrible disease of leprosy she
was shunned.
The county health officials were in sore
straits. They did not know what to do
with her. There was no provision for such
as she in the whole county, nor could they
imagine for a while how to dispose of the
girl. In this extremity they sent her to
this city.
The girl's father accompanied her, and
they went direct to the Pesthouse. Lena
was in a wretched condition, almost naked
for want of a few articles of clothing, and
greatly emaciated. Her condition, so the
doctors said, denoted neglect and an ab
sence of nourishment. She was taken in
and given a room in the leper hospital,
and then some charitable ladies sent her
bundles of warm clothing.
Seeing that she would be an expense to
the City and County perhaps for years to
come, Dr. A. P. O'Brien, the City Physi
cian, addressed a communication to the
Board of Health setting forth the facts of
the case and suggesting that Mendocino
County should pay for the girl's mainten
ance at the Pesthouse.
The Board of Health has taken up the
matter, and will notify the Supervisors of
Mendocino that they will be required to
support the girl. It is thus proposed to
establish a precedent and let the counties
understand that San Francisco shall not
be used as a refuge or a dumping ground
for lepers.
"I think," said Dr. O'Brien, "that Men
docino should pay for her support and at
tendance."
"If Mendocino should refuse to pay?"
"We would have to ship her back to
Ukiah. She could go to the County In
firmary there. The State has no funds to
devote" to such cases."
