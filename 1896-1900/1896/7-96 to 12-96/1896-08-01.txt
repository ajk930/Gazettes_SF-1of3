ENGINEEE F ABE'S SAD DEATH.
During a Farewell Trip Over the
Road His Body Is Mangled Under
the Engine.
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., July 31.â As a
result of the terrible collision on the
Meadowa last evening Letween the Read
ing Railroad express from Philadelphia
and the Bridgeton excursion train out of
here, forty-seven people are dead and
forty-four are lying in the hospital here
more or less seriously hurt. Of the in
jured in the hospital several are expected
to die. Besides those seriously enough
hurt to be in the hospital a score or more
of people were bruised and shaken up and
went to cottages. The fearful shock of
the collision is illustraded in the fact that
of the forty-seven dead forty-two were
killed outright Of tne dead forty- two
have been identified and the bodies of
three women, one man and a boy are
lying at the undertaking-shops awaiting
claimants.
The responsibility for the accident is
hard to place at this time, but the burden
of it seems to rest upon the dead engi
neer of the Reading train, Edward Farr,
though an official examination may clear
his name.

all of whom are from Bridgeton, fol

Many of the injuries are more than
ordinarily serious. All through last night
Atlantic City was in an uproar. Thou
sands thronged out to the scene of the
wreck and crowded around the railway
station and pushed and crowded to watch
the trains discharge their loads of dead
and injured. As it was gradually learned
that nearly every one on the Reading
express had escaped uninjured the crowd
gradually thinned out, the anxiety of rela
tives and friends being relieved by the
safe arrival of tnose they feared were dead
or maimed.
The nninjurei and those only slightly
hurt among the Bridgeton excursionists
were in a frenzy of azony.
The train struck was the first section of
the excursion train and those on the
second section flocked to the hospital and
morgue as the victims were brought in.
Two miles out on the Meadows the wreck
ing crews of the Reading and the West
Jersey roads were toiling by the li-ht of
huge bonfires to clear away the wreck and
splinters or broken cars. By dawn they
had practically cleared the broken tracks.
Broken and battered out of shape the
huge engine of the express lay on its side
by the track. Pinned beneath, with his
pale, blood-stained face staring into those
of the men working, was Farr, the
engineer.
Not until this morning were the workers
able to raise the wrecked engine and draw
from beneath it the crushed body of the
engineer. It was placed in a box and
taken to Farr's home here. It was re
ported last night when Mrs. Farr heard of
her husband's death she, fell dead. This
was not so. She fell in a swoon and to
night is lying in a serious condition from
the shock she got.
Houser, the operator in the signal
tower, set danger signals for the Reading
train when he gave the excursion train
tne right of way. The question is, Did he
6et the iignal in time for Engineer Farr to
see it, or did he become excited when he
saw a collision imminent and set it too
late for Farr to stop his train ? Farr wai
an exDerienced engineer, and it seems in
credible that he would rush past a danger
signal down to a crossing that was being
approached by a train he could clearly
see.
Further, the Reading has the right of
way at the crossing over Pennsylvania
trains; and, still further, an express has
the right of way over an excursion special.
btiil, iv riew of the statement of Engineer j
The San Francisco Call.
Griener oi the excursion train, who was
interviewed in Camden to-day and the po
.sition of the signal arms, the burden of
responsibility rests with the dead engineer.
It is reported that last night's ride,
which ended in disaster and death for En
gineer Farr, at least, was to have ter
minated in a change of circumstances and
a happier life. It was to have been his
last ride on the engine, aud the second
man in the cab, who was also killed and
whose identity has not been fully estab
lished, was to have succeeded him in the
position. Farr and his wife had been sav
ing money for several years and managed
to save enough to stock a little store on
Atlantic avenue with cheap notions. To
day cad been fixed for the beginning of
the new career, but to-day the store is
closed. Â
The usual greeting, "Are you going to
the board-walk?" has given way to "Are
you going to the wreck to-day ?" and every
body went.

BRIGANDAGE AND MURDER.
Women Among a Gang of Cutthroats
That Infest a District of
AGRAM, Hungary, July 31.â For some
time the Stenjevee district was infested
by a gang that was organized for the pur

effort to extirpate the gang, the result being
that a number of men and women were
arrested either on direct knowledge that
they were implicated in the crimes of
which the gang were accused or on suspi
cion that they were implicated. The pris
oners were brought to trial and to-day a
verdict of guilty of murder was pro
nounced against nineteen of them, who
were sentenced to death. Others of the
prisoners were convicted of lesser crimes
and were sentenced to various terms of
imprisonment. Two of the prisoners on
whom sentence of death was passed are
women.

THURSTON TALKS
FOR McKINLEY.
Republicans Have a Good
Champion in the
Senator.
BIG ISSUES OF THE DAY.
How Bryan's Argument Changed
From the Tariff to Sil
ver Coinage.
FREE TRADE AND FREE SILVER
Clarence Darrow Attempts to Reply
and Evokes a Lively Storm
of Hisses.
MADIBON, Wis., July 31.â Senator
Thurston of Nebraska, for the Republican
party, and Clarence S. Darrow, a Chicago
lawyer, for the Democrats and Populists,
contested with oratory and argument for
Presidential votes tnis afternoon at Lake
side, the grounds of the Monowni Assem
bly near this city. The gathering, politi
cally, was Republican by a large majority,
and the assignment of the Senator to
speak under the auspices of the assembly
on its closing day by the Republican Na
tional Committee made the event, in part,
the opening of the Western campaign.
About 8000 persons, many of them wo
men, were present. By a lucky chance only
a fatality was averted on the Madison
street side of tne lake. Senator Thurston
had been escorted by a hundred members
of the local Republican marching club
from the Park Hotel to the pier where
steam launches are taken to Lake Wise.
There was a wild scramble of hundreds to
get tickets and reaÂ«h the boats on a frail,
rotten landing of single planks, which
threatened to collapse under the extra
weight.
No attempt was made to check the
crowd and some of the people broke past
the ticket-takers to a narrow pier used to
load coal. The Senator had embarked
when this frail woodwork broke, carrying
a dozen persons into four feet of water.
William Larkin, an old retired citizen of
Madison, fell flat in the water, his head
striking a rock, which inflicted a bad
scalp wound, but he was saved from
drowning.
Senator Thurston was first presented to
the audience, being allowed one hour and
five minutes to speak. The Senator said:
"We are here especially to discuss cer
tain financial theories and 'views which
are disturbing our people. This money
question is a new one in this campaien. I
was brought up to believe that the judg
ment of the man who had succeeded in
life was better to follow than that of the
man who had failed; that the word of the
man who had never broken his promise
was hotter to believe than that of the man
who had broken his word. Therefore, I
think it is safer for me to keep away from
the leadership of such men as Al'geld and
Tillman and Llewelling and Waite and
follow the lead of Allison and Reed and
that greatest of all Americansâ William
McKinley of Ohio.
"Four years ago the issue before the
people, made for the most part by the men
who are now presenting another issue, was
not the issue which they would have you
believe should be the one on which to go
to the polls in 1896. William J. Bryan
made no other argument and advocated
no other Issue four years ago than the
tariff. He and his associates had no inten
tion of bringing forth this new issue until
they saw they were everlastingly defeated
on the issue of free trade on which
they secured a majority of votes four
years ago. Mr. Bryan said then, 'Give us
free trade and business will boom,' but it
busted.
"Now these men come before you with a
new promise. They say, 'Give us free sil
ver and wages will go up; give us free sil
ver and business will boom.' Don't you
think, in view of the pro irises given four
years ago and their default to pay, that it
would be best to ask for a little collateral
security on which to back up this new
promise? They say it is a nostrum for all
our ills. Nothing sells so well in the
United States as a patent medicine or a
new kind of chewing-gum. Tne whole
campaign of free silver is based on a prom
ise of something better when free silver
comes.
"I do not want to Mexicanize oar Amer
ican dollar or apologize for its cheapness.
Gold means free coinage. Did you stop to
think that if free coinage of silver will in
crease the value of that bullion it will
not bring to the people higher wages or
give them better prices for their product ?
Free coinage will either lower the .
dard of our dollar to the SO-cent Mexican
dollar or else it will double the value oi
our neighbor's dollar without expense M
them." j
The Senator mentioned that on Jnly H
the Chicago Chronicle had charge** Bryan
with being tbe paid agent and spokesman
of the bonanza kings, who had really
made the eiivar issue, and that he had not
met the charge.
"That man," cried the Senator, "posing
as the friend of the downtrodden masses,
holding a crown of thorns in one hand and
the bugaboo of a cross of gold in the other,
owes it to every man, woman and child in
this country to say whether that charge is
false or whether it is true."
He closed by arguing that cheap money
would not help tbe poor man.
Mr. Darrow was then introduced. He
did not think the settlement of the free
coinage question would ever give to the la
borer that which he never had under a Dem
ocratic or Republican administration â a
full share of the product of his toil, nor
lift from the farmer the great burden of
debt and distres? under which he lived.
But it would do something. He repudi
ated the Senator's prescription of four
more years of the gold cure, administered
by McKinley instead of Cleveland. He
accused the Cleveland Democrats of work
ing for McKinley, and asked the people to
support what was McKinley's policy until
he became a candidate for the Presidency.
It was the first time that a National paty
in the United States had asked that silver
money should be stricken down and gold
alone used by our people. The proposi
tion was so outrageous and unheard of
that the men who framed it at St. Louis
were afraid to openly advocate it, and
added the international agreement clause
as a sop which they and the people knew
to be a trick and a lie.
He sternly resented the Senator's claim
to be an American when he defended the
proposition to become the bonded slave of
Lombard street and Wall street. He created
a sensational scene when he declared that
if a dollar's worth of American wheat
continued to be sold fox 50 cents the
Englishman will collect his interest from
America as he does from the Egyptian,
with cannon and with sword.
The speaker was vigorously hissed and
several men arose, shook their fists and
cried "never." The chairman appealed
for order and a fair hearing.
Replying to the charge against Mr.
Bryan, he said it came from a McKinley
organ, owned by a bank president.
Senator Tburston in closing denounced
the attempt to array class against class and
section against section. There was no such
issue under the stars and stripes. A party
was needed to build up, not tear down.
Finally he said: "The man who holds
the key to the situation is the officer who
held tbe line for Sheridan at Shenandoah,
Major McKinley, and please God he will
be our next President."

BRYAN'S EASTERN TOUR.
It Win extend All th* Way to Maine tl
Where SetvnV In to Be riaitecfl
LINCOLN, Nebr., July 31.â After spend
ing as much time as he could spare to-day
from numerous callers, Mr. Bryan this
evening completed the itinerary of his
journey to New York. He has not in
cluded any stops for speeches, bat in view
of his disposition to oblige in that regard,
is shown on his trip from Chicago to Lin
coln, it is probable that he will say some
thing en route. Pittsburg is the only
large city where tbe night of a week day
will be spent, and Mr. Bryan may be pre
vailed on to address an auuience there.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan will leave Lincoln
by the Burlington route at 6 o'clock on
Friday evening, August 7, on the train
due in Chicago Saturday afternoon. They
will remain in Chicago over Sunday, leav
ing there just before 12 o'clock Sunday
night by the Pennsylvania road. Mon
day night will be spent in Pittsburg to
enable Mr. aud Mrs. Bryan to secur a
good rest, and the departure for New
York will be made early Tuesday morn
ing, so as to reach there at 6:30 o'clock
that evening.
The National Committee will meet in
New York at the time of the notification,
and important campaign work will be
discussed.
From New York Mr. and Mrs. Bryan
will go to Bath, Me., to visit Mr. and Mrs.
Sewali. The return trip will not be ar
ranged until after tbe New York notifica
tion meeting. Mr. Bryan is not making
any dates for speeches at this time and
will not do so until after the National
Committee has been consulted.
News of his indorsement by the Tam
many executive committee was received
by Mr. Bryan this afternoon in a telegram
from Congressman Amos J. Cummings.
Mr. Cummings wired: "The Tammany
executive committee has just unani
mously indorsee your nomination. My
personal congratulations."
WILSON'S VOICE WANTED.
A Letter Would Be Worth Ten Thousand
Votes.
HUNTINGTON. W. Va., July 31.â John
P. Simms of Jtiuntingtoii will represent
Weat Virginia at the. lndianapolis sound
money National conference. This was de
cided at the sound-money conference at
Wheeling yesterday. The floods swept
away the railway track in front of Gov
ernor McCorKle a train and he was unable
to be present. It. was accepted, however,
that the Governor will lead in the tight
against Bryan.
The belief is general that the voice of
Postmaster-General Wilson will be heard
for sound money. No one spoke for Him
directly, but there was no dissent from
the statement made by a representative of
the Eastern district, who declared that a
letter from Wilson would be worth 10,000
votes.
The campaign will be made distinctly
on sound-money lines; whenever it is
possible to meet a Republican antagonist
on tbe stump he will be asked to divide
his time with sound-money Dem
ocratic speaker, and the Bryan speakers
will be confronted at every point.
FARMERS ARE EXCITED.
Cautioned by a Bank to Stay Out of
Debt for Grave Reaaons.
OMAHA, Nebb., July 31.â The greatest
excitement prevails among farmers of
Boxbutte County over a communication
received yesterday from the First National
Bank of Alliance. The letter was received
by persons who were obligated to the
bank and whose loans become due before
November and reads :
Alliance, Nebr., July 23, 1896.
Dear Sir: Owing to the constant agitation of
the financial policy of the United States and
the socialistic feeling emanating from the
Chicago convention there has been a doubt
thrown over the minds of the people, such
that points to the possibility of a greater panic
than we have yet seen should the laboring
men of this country be thrown out of employ
ment (now only half employed). There will
be great labor trouble, such that will call on
our military and cause much distrust to the
future outcome. We prefer to do nothing
until there is more stability rather than take
the chances of losing what we have, and
would advise all our friends to stay out of
debt. We will call in all our paper this fall.
We have your note, $ , due . Please be
prepared to meet it promptly and do not ask
for further time. Yours truly,
R. M. Hampton, Cashier.
SILVER MEN OF FLORIDA.
Democratic Leader* Boldly Repudiate
the Electoral Ticket.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., July 31.â The
silver Democratic leaders of Florida have
repudiated the Democratic electoral ticket
and decided to issue an address to the
tree-silver Democrats requesting them to
send delegates to a State convention at
which the future course of the faction will
be determined upon. This action was
taken by the Bryan and Sewall Silver Club
of Florida at a meeting held in Jackson
ville to-day, and the avowed purpose of
the leaders is to put new State and
electoral tickets in the field composed
entirely of silver men. The trouble has
been coming evident ever since the State
convention in June, when a free-silver
plank was defeated by a tie vote, the silver
men alleging that the result was accom
plished by a silver delegate being induced
by improper influence to violate his in
structions.

mostly engaged in the tin-plate industry,
from Gurnsey County, came to Canton
this afternoon to call on Major McKinley.
Ex-Congressman J. D. Taylor acted as

They are men who have learned to love
you for your patriotic devotion to your
country in time of war and in time of
peace. These old comrades have come to
pay tribate to your high personal charac
ter and for the public service you have
rendered. The old soldiers want one
thins remembered, and that is that the
honor and integrity of the old flag must
be maintained. We have come to believa
that the star of hope for the laboring man
is resting in Canton. In behalf of the
men and women in this delegation â for
there are a number of ladies who have
come along with usâ l extend greeting to
you and Mrs. McKinley."
Major McKinley spoke without manu
script and with his usual emphasis, saying:
"Coionel Taylor, My Comrades ana
Fellow-citizens: It gives me great gratifi
cation to receive this call from my ( old
friends and neighbors and fellow-citizens
of Gurnsey County. I have made many
visits to your county in years gone by,
and know most of you personally. I knovr
something of the quality of your popula
tion. I know something of the spirit of
yonr people. I know something of your
loyalty and devotion to the Union in war,
and I know much of your loyalty and de
votion and patriotism and good govern
merit in peace. [Cheers.] And knowing
you as well as I do know you, I am cer
tain that neither flood nor fire would stop
you from doing what you had proposed to
do. [Laughter and applause.]
'I am glad to meet the representatives
of labor who are assembled here this
morning. I am glad, my fellow-citizens,
to meet my old comrades of the G. A.. R.
[applause], my comrades of thirty-five
years ago, for the war commenced thirty
rive years ago, and it is nearly thirty-two
years since it closed.
"It is not so long nor so far away, but
as I look into the faces of the old soldiers
before me to-day I see that age is stamp
ing its lines of care upon them. Their
step is no longer as steady and as firm as
it was thirty-five years ago, but their
hearts are just as loyal to the old flag of the
Union. [Tremendous cheers.] And they
are just as loyal to National honor to-day
as they were loyal to National unity then.
"The old soldiers never were in favor of
repudiating that debt. [Applause.] They
wanted every dollar of the debt paid in
the best money known to the commercial
world. [Great applause.] There is no
body more interested in maintaining a
sound and stable currency than the old
soliliers of the Republic [applause and
cries of 'You're right, Major'], their
widows and their orphans. Your old com
mander, General Grant [applause],
whose memory is cherished by all of you,
performed two great and conspicuous acts
while President of tbe United Statesâ one
vetoing the inflation bill, that would have
cast us upon the sea of a depreciated cur
rency, and the other was the signing of
the act for tbe resumption of specie pay
ments, that placed every dollar of our
money upon the sound foundation of
financial honor and unquestioned National
honesty.'
"I thank you, my fellow-citizens, for
this call, so expressive of your good will
and congratulations, and assure you that
it will afford me much pleasure to meet
every One of you personally." [Ap
plause.]
SOUND MONEY CLUBS.
Leaders of Both Parties Much Intereated

CHICAGO, 111., July 3Lâ Sound-money
men of both parties are much interested
in a movement toward the organization of
sound-money clubs among Chicago busi

they were preparing to call on Mr. Hanna
at the National headquarters to-morrow.
What Sewall Mas to Say.
BATH, Me., July 31.â Mr. Sewall said
to-day: "The silver ranks are growing
daily stronger in Maine. The only issue
of this campaign is silver. The Republi
cans have orders to force the tariff to the
front, but cannot, it is a secondary issue
that the people are not talking about. The
trouble is not there. They want prosper
ity, which is having every man at work
and all wheels moving. They want to get
rid of paralysis of business. They have
tried a nigh and low taiiff, and matters
have been continually growing worse. The
Democratic party has decided that the
trouble lies in the financial system, and
that the remedy is remonetization of sil
ver."
Jtemncrats Scent Defeat.
BOSTON, Mass., July 31.â Euclid Martin
of Omaha, chairman of the gold Demo
cratic State Committee of Nebraska, passed
through this city to-day on his way to
New York.
"I think McKinley will be elected next
fall," be said, "if the Republicans carry on
the fight where and as they ought to. By
this condition I mean the great contest
will be in West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois,
Indiana, Nebraska and some of the States
near these. I believe most if not all of
them are certain to go for McKinley if the
Republicans carry on the right sort of a

AIR-PROPELLED STREETCARS.
Satisfactory Test of * Coach Driven by
Compressed Atmosphere.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 31.â One of
the new air-motor cars recently received
by the Third-avenue Railroad Company
in this city, which, it was promised, would
revolutionize surface traction, was pri
vately tested yesterday with the most
satisfactory results.
The car was run twice over the One
Hundred and Twenty-fifth street road
from the North River to the Harlem
River. It was run at the will of the
motorman at a speed of from four to fif
teen miles ;',n hour, and the McPherson
brake, with which it is fitted, acted with
great promptness and efficiency.
Each car is supplied with a sandbox
which dumps a quantity of sand on the
trace when an emergency requires that
the car be stopped witb more than usual
quickness. The sandbox was tried when
the car was moving at the rate of twelve
miles an hour, and the car was stopped in
a littie more than its length.
The compressed-air reservoir had a
pressure of i&QO pounds to the square inch
when the car started on the trip. The
pressure was reduced a half when the car
had completed its journey of eight miles.
It is estimated that the reservoir will hold
enougii air to propel the car a distance of
fifteen miles.
ATTEMPTED EXPRESS ROBB ERY
Cripple Creek's Output Sought by Colo-
rndo Springs Bandit*.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., July 31.â
What looks like an attempt to rob the safe
ot the Wells-Fargo express office in this
city was made about 9:30 to-night. The
accidental discharge of a revolver evi
dently frightened the would-be robbers
away. The front and side doors of the ex
press office were found open and the lights
out when the police arrived on the scene
a tew moments after the gunshot was
heard. Local officers of the Well-Fargo
Company refuse to talk beyond denying
that anything is missing. It is understood
that large sums of money are in transit
between this city and Cripple Creek, and
this may have been what the robbbers
were after.

SENATOR WOLCOTT
YET A REPUBLICAN
Issues a Statement to the
Voters of Colorado
State.
M'KINLEY THE LEADER.
Under His Banner Only Can the
People of the Nation Be
come Prosperous.
PROTECTION THE FIRST ISSUE.
There Should Be No Sectional Feel
ing, Says the Senator, in the
Coming Struggle.
DENVER, Colo., July 31.â Senator Wol
cott, whose friends yesterday succeeded in
carrying the Republican State Committee
in opposition to Senator Teller and the
strong silver element, to-night issued the
following statement to the voters of this
commonwealth:
The people of Colorado are entitled to know
at such a juncture as this the views ot their
representatives at Washington. Among the
greatest privileges we enjoy under Republican
icstitutions are freedom of conscience and
freedom of speech, and if I should hesitate on
this, or on any other proper occasion, to de
claie any belief and my convictions on any
public question, I should desoise myself even
more than 1 despise those incendiary news
papers aud hysterical individuals who assume
that threats and vituperation can choke the
utterances of uny self-respecting citizen in
Colorado who has an opinion to express or a
principle to declare.
The silver question is most vital. Interna
tional bimetallism at the former ratio would,
of course, be the most desirable method of re
storing silver as a money metal, because tbe
disturbance of values which might follow the
inauguration of free coinage by the United
Stntes alone would be avoided, and the ques
tion as to the exportation or hoarding of gold
would be eliminated. In my opinion, how
ever, the United States alone could, under wise
and conservative guidance â such guidance as
should deserve and receive the confidence of
all classes of our peopleâ open its mints to the
unlimited coinage of silver and successfully
maintain that metal at a parity with gold at
the ratio of 16 to 1, independently of the other
nations of the world. During the seven years
of my public service in the Senate I have al
ways held this view. My vote on all questions
affecting the currency has been identical with
that of the other Senators usually known as
silver Senators, and while my utterances on
the silver question may not have been as fre
quent or as long as those of others whose views
I share, nevertheless my record on this subject
is clear and consistent, and the views I hold I
expect always to maintain.
The financial plank of the National Repub
lican platform is, in my opinion, far from
satisfactory, and 'hose members of the party
who believe as I believe will struggle ear
nestly and hopefully for the full and complete
recognition and adoption by the Republican
party of the humane principles of bimetal
lism, animated by the belief that the party
which on every other great question involv
ing human freedom and the welfare of man
kind, has stood for all that was uplifting and
ennobling, wiil yet realize! that a continuance
of the gold standard means ouly further im
poverishment aud suffering. The platform
contains, however, a most important state
ment, pledging the party to the furtherance
of bimetallism by international agreement.
To the good faith of this pledge the history of
the party on other questions requires the full
est credence; the overshadowing importance
of the silver question makes it certain to my
mind that every effort will be earnestly made
by the Republican party to secure to this coun
try the blessings of bimetallism, and it is my
sincere corviction tnat silver will again be
restored to its place as a money metal at the
presen* ratio, and that when this restoration
comes it will be accomplished through the ac
tion and efforts of tbe Republican party.
Except on the money question no man in
Colorado, who believes in the protection of
American labor and American product* and
American industries and who loves his coun
try, can read the platform without hearty ap
proval, and no man doubts that Major McKin
ley will Dring to his hign office every quality
needed by a President of this great people.
Mr. Bryan has been nominated for the Presi
dency <>n three separate platforms, by the
Democratic party, the Populist party and the
Silver party. The last-named party (the Silver
party) does not deserve serious consideration.
Most of its members were present at its recent
convention in St. Louis, and the newspapers
report the convention hall as being less than
half full.
The Democratic party nominated Mr. Bryan
upon a platform, the financial portion of
which was everything that could be desired
and the rest oi it everything that is, in my
opinion, undesirable and hostile to the inter
ests of our country. I decline to stand upon
this platform and vote for this candidate even
with the alluring free-coinage plank. I can
not do it. lam a believer in protection, and
>hall not abandon tnat belief.
The Supreme Court of the United States is a
pure and able tribunal, the highest judicial
tribunal in the world. I will not help smirch
it. This Government must be enabled to pay
its running expenses, and whenever my vote
is needed tor that purpose and I fail to vote it
â¢upplies to keep it alive I shall consider tnat
I violate my oath as Senator. Tne "recent Re
publican Congresses" have been neither
wasteful nor extravagant, and I must decline
to certify to a statement I know to be untrue.
When, some months ago, the great railway
strike at Chicago grew beyond control and in
nocent lives were being â¢acrificed and millions
of dollars' worth of properly was being de
stroyed by lawless men ; when the Sheriff was
powerless and the Governor failed to perform
his duty, the President of the United States,
with Federal troops,., under sanction of law,
saved further bloodshed and destruction and
thereby deserved the thanks of every man who
values our liberties and believes that the
rights guaranteed ub by . the constitution
ought to be sacredly guarded against every
form of lawlessness.
The recent travesty at St. Louis, the Popu
list convention, has but illustrated the ele
ments which naturally gravitate toward the
candidacy of Mr. Bryan. Every cranky quirk,
every Incongruous and ludicrous and mis
shapen idea which the wheels in the braini of
men could evolve, buzzed and whirled through
days of talk, but the net result was Bryan.
Government ownership of railroads, telegraph
and telephone lines, initiative ond referendum,
silver money and more money, had their advo
cates, and at the end, on assurances that all
who voted lor Bryan would be equally recog
nized, Mr. Bryan was almost the unanimous
choice of the convention.
Because, tnerefore, I believe that free coin
age will come through the efforts of theÃenub
lican party, and because the Democratic and
Populist platforms, except on the money ques
tions, are odious and hostile to the welfare of
our country, I shall not cast my vote for Mr.
Bryan. I hold my commission from the Re
publican party. Many of its members, includ
ing some of its leaders, in the exercise of their
judment have anounced their Intention of
leaving the party. I shall stay.
My ioynlty to the party which has honored
me is entirely consistent with my loyalty to
the highest and best interests of tbe State I
represent in the Senate of the United States,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 1, 1896.
and I know no reason why I should abandon
my party or desert its colors. The ro Is to my
mind no reason why it was not as much our
duty to vole for Weaver four years ago as for
Bryan to-day. The Omaha platform declared
for free coinage and was no more objection
able than the Chicago platform; and Bryan is
vouched for by leading Populists as being "as
good a Populist as lives." The Populists have
not changed in the past four years. It is we
who are expected 10 join their aggregation.
Others may find it wise or expedient, but I
won't do it. Whenever the course of events
could make it possible that I should speak
from the same platform as Tillman orWaite,
or Ignatius Donnelly, in advocacy of the same
Presidential candidate, I know there must be
something wrong with me. What we need in
Colorado is less hysterics and more common
sense.
We have glorious resources yet in the in
fancy of their development; we are suffering
from the imposition of a mistaken financial
policy, which it is our natural and proper de
sire to see overthrown as speedily as possible.
We are one of forty-six States in the Union,
each free and sovereign. Within our borders
live about one one-hundred-and-flftieth of the
people of tne United States. We live in a re
public where the majority rules. The vast
majority ol the people of the United States are
honest and of high average intelligence and
devoted to the perpetuity of free institutions.
Our great desire is to induce a majority of the
people of the United States to believe as we be
lieve. The way to the accomplishment of this
result is not by vituperation and abuse. The
press of the country, East as well as West, is
largely responsible for the bitter sectional
feeling now Bought to be invoked.
Ii is for us who do not own or control news
papers, and are not In the business of throw
ing mud, to remember that of the millions of
people who will cast their oallots this fall
nearly all are as patriotic as we are, and, with
us, equally desirous that this Republic shall
live and not die. The people of the East are
our brothers, we sprung from the same loins,
we have a common country, a common faith
and the same dear flag. Tnis gospel of hate
which is now being preached should find no
followers among sane men, no welcome among
good citizens.
We who believe in the free coinage of both
gold and silver at our mints, at the ratio here
tofore existing, will secure the adoption of our
views when we are able to induce the majority
of our fellow-citizens to share our belief, when
people who do not agree with us shall be led
to agree with us, not alone because of our ar
guments on finance, but because our views on
other great questions entitle us to public con
fidence and respect. Free coinage will never
come, in my opinion, out of the jumble and
folly of the Chicago platform, nor vrill It be
heralded by the cap and bells of Populist.

FLOAT HAWAIIAN BONDS.
Efforts to Negotiate a Loan o:
$3,330,000 in the United
States.
General News of the Islands That Is
of Interest to California
HONOLULU, Hawaii, July 23.â The
Government has completed the details of
arrangements with Peter C. Jones of Hon
olulu, who represents a California syndi
cate, for floating the new Hawaiian loan of
$3,330,000, The loan is to run twenty-five
years at 4 per cent with the privilege of
fifty years at the same rate.
It is learned from Government sources
that it is the desire of the Cabinet to have
this loan placed in the United States if
possible in preference to taking it to Eng
land, where it must otherwise go. Mr.
Jones will leave for California in about a
month, ana the statement is made upon
his authority that, in hopes of having the
loan taken up in the United States, the
Hawaiian Government has authorized him
to offer the bonds there at 95. The Min
ister of finance has lately made a public
statement which shows the finances of the
Islands to be in the best condition.
The court-martial trial of Captain John
Good for inciting sedition and for behavior
unbecoming an officer and gentleman is
going slowly forward, and will probably
not be concluded for over a week. The
prosecution has yet seven witnesses, and
twelve or more will be introduced for the
defense. Nothing new has developed, and
sympathy remains with Captain Good.
Some who claim inside knowledge declare
that in case a conviction is reached the
Government will demand the resignations
of both Captain Good and Colonel Mc-
Lane, who is urging the charges against
the former.
This morning the Advertiser published
the following extract, received here by the
Australia, written to Thomas G. Thrum
by his son, D. F. Thrum. The Hammond
referred to is the San Francisco agent of
tbe American BiDle Society:
"Mr. Hammond, in talking with me on
island affairs, said that within one year
Hawaii would probably be annexed, as be
had just returned from the East, and
while there had a personal interview with
his intimate friend, Major McKinley, who
said that the islands ought to be annexed,
or words to that effect."
Mr. Hammond is spoken of here by
those who claim to know as the warm per
sonal friend of McKinley, and one to whom
he would be likely to state candidly his
attitude toward the islands and annexa
tion in case of his election.
Early tnis morning tbe dry-goods store

NEW YORK, N. V., July 3Lâ A Her
ald special from Washington says: The
State Department has just received an ad
verse communication from the Madrid
authorities in answer to the demand made
on them for an immediate settlement of
the claim preserred against the Spanish
Government by Dr. Jos* Delgado, an
American citizen who w"as outrageously
treated by the Spanish troops on his estate
near Havana, Cuba.
In its note containing the demand the
department sets forth evidence to prove
the justice of the claim, laying particular
stress upon the statement and action of
Captain-General Weyler after the outrage
bad beencommitteed.
The reply which has been received from
Spain goes into the details respecting the
visit of the Spanish troops to tbe Delgado
plantation and to their subsequent actions
while there.
Immediately after the receipt of the
demand from the United States tbe Mad
rid authorities ordered that an investi
gation be made the occurrence, and
the report of this investigation was for
warded on completion to the Spanish
capital. The report sustains tbe action
of the Spanish forces ana attempts to
explain the outrage committed on Dr.
Delgado.
The claim that the department is press
ing is that for personal injuries sustained
by Dr. Delgado. The damage to his prop
erty has been assessed and forwarded to
Spain as a separate claim. It will be con
sidered in conjunction with many others
which have been filed and submitted to
the Madrid authorities by a joint commis
sion, which will be appointed by the two
Governments at the close of the Cuban
rebellion.
In reply to Spain's note that the de
partment is preparing a reiteration of the
demand will be made and tbe weak points

TRENTON, Mich., July 31. - The
twenty-eighth annual regatta of the North
western Amateur Rowing Association
opened here this afternoon. There was a
strong breeze blowing down the river,
which made the water quite rough ana
the row up stream was very hard. All five

COMBINE OF STEEL MEN
Meeting of the Manufacturers
Who Ectared the Scheme to
Raise Prices.
Various Little Matters That Caused
Controversy Are Finally Straight
ened Out.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 31.â The first
quarterly meeting of the steel manufac
turers who formed a combination some
months ago for the purpose of protecting
and equalizing the price of steel billets
was held to-day at the Holland House. It
was an important gathering in one re
spect, viz. : that it settled the permanency
of the organization.
The conference of committees showed
that tbe working principles of the com
bine had largely benefited the manufac
turers of iron and steel billets. That is
all any one concerned in the gathering
would say.
In connection with this meeting a rumor
went tbe rounds that there was trouble in
the combination, which is the strongest in
the iron and steel trade ever organized.
It was said that there was considerable
dissatisfaction among the smaller nrms,
who, it was alleged, charged the Carnegie
Company of Pittsburg and the Illinois
Steel Company of Chicago with having
grabbed tbe greater share of the business
done in the trade since the organization
of tbe pool at the Waldorf Hotel on Ap.nl
5 last.
It was also said that threats of secession
had been made by tbe alleged dissatisfied
manufacturers, and that to-day's meeting
had been specially called to smooth mat
ters over.
The price of billets was discussed at
length and arranged according to the
location of the mills.
One price that was definitely set is that
of $20 25 per ton for the Pittsburg district,
which is by far the most important of any
in the country. Of the twenty-seven com
panies which make up the combination
twenty were represented at to-day's meet
ing.
Very Rapid Crew Transportation.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 31.â Word
was received at the Naval Department to
day that the special train carrying 100
men of the crew of the Charleston from
Mare Island, Cal., to Norfolk had arrived
at the latter point, making the trip by the
southern route in four days and twenty
three hours, breaking all previous records
for transcontinental journeys. Until re
cently enlisted men' were exchanged be
tween tbe Pacific and Atlantic coasts by
way of Panama, consuming an average of
thirty-five days, during which time the
men's services were lost to the navy, al
though their pay and subsistence went on.
The advantages of the now transit system
would be very great in time of sudden hos
tilities.
Will Ao( Combine.
WASHINGTON, D. C. July 31.â At a
conference this morning between Senators
Stewart of the Silver committee and Faulk
ne; of the Democratic Congressional com
m.ttce it was decided that while the two
committees would work in harmony they
would not be merged, for the reason that
the Silver committee would know best the
needs of its own people. Silver headquar
ters will accordingly be opened in this
city. It is thought George P. Keeney of
California, who has long been connected
with the silver movement, trill be placed
in charge.

Against Secret Treaties.
LONDON, England, July 31.â The In
ternational Socialists' Congress to-day
decided upon the creation of a per
manent international committee with
headquarters in London.
In a speech on the arbitration resolu
tion Lucien Sanian of New York called
in question the sincerity of so-called
statesmen who are negotiating for the
establishment of a court of arbitration,
and said that unless it was ior the advan
tage of the middle class arbitration waÂ«
never resorted to.
Mr. Winstone of New York insisted
upon being allowed to speak, nnd, mount
ing a chair, shouted that the people of
America were not unanimous on the ar
bitration question by a long ways.
Amid the din which arose other dele
gates were heard yelling: "Who sent
Winstone to the congress?" The attitude
assumed by his opponents became so
menacing that Mr. Winstone left the
meeting, and the trouble thus ended.
Resolutions favoring the abolition of
standing aimies, against secret treaties
and in favor of socialization of industry
were adopted.
A ROMA NCE OF `49.
Reunion of a Miner and Hit Wife, Sep
arated 47 Tear*.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., July 31.â 1n 1849,
when the California gola fever was at its
height, John F. Robinson of Illopolis, a
village ten miles east of here, left his wife
ana young son and went to the coast to
make his fortune. After three years' ab
sence indefinite rumors came to Mrs. Rob
inson that he had been killed in a tight
with Indians. To be on the safe side she
secured a divorce on the ground of deser
tion, and was subsequently married to a
man named Barry, who died about two
years ago.
Some time ago Robinson, who was still
in his California home, heard of a John
Robinson in Decatur and wondered if it
might not be his son. He addressed a
letter to the Decatur man, and was in
formed by the latter that he was another
Robinson and that the old man's son was
dead. He was further told by the Decatur
correspondent that Mrs. Berry, Robinson's
former wife, was still living.
A correspondence was begun with her,
and the result is that the old man arrived
here from California on Sunday, had a
joyous meeting with Mrs. Berry, secured a
marriage license and will marry her the
second timo to-morrow. Robinson says
he wrote several letters home after he went
to California, but receiving no response to
them he supposed his wife and her son
were both dead.

provinces. His ambition is to have trav
eled once around, twice across and three

TRANSCONTINENTAL RICYCLING
From. Seattle to Chicago 'in Less Than
Two Month*.
CHICAGO, 111., July 31.â W. H. Shene
man arrived in Chicago yesterday after a
long ride by wheel from Seattle. He left
the Pacific Coast June 1 on a touring trip,
expecting to reach Columous, Ohio, by
October 1. After he had crossed two States
on his journey, he had made such good
time that fie decided to keep as far ahead
of his schedule as he could. Until Omaha
was reached Sheneman averaged seventy
five miles a day. There he encountered
heavy roaas and rainy weather and was
delayed eleven days. " ' *
Shortly after leaving Seattle he reached
the desert which extends from Prosser
Falls to Umatilia. This was the most
perilous part of the trip, and in attempt
ing to cross the thirty-five miles of sandy
fields the tourist nearly lost his life. He
could not ride the wheel through the sand
and had to dismount and push it.
All the water in his canteen had been
consumed before he had covered half the
desert, and when he reached the Colum
bia River he fell exhausted on tne bans. -
"With the exception of the desert and
the rainy spells," said : he, "the trip was
most enjoyable. The Western country,
with its mountain scenery, is the ideal ex
cursion for cyclists- The roads ; are ,in
good condition and can be covered at a
good clip. '
. "I am a novice at this mode of ' travel
ing, but if one has time it is the only way
to . see the country. The mountains are
comparatively easy to .cross and |do not
offer nearly as formidable a barrier to the
wheelman as some o! the small deserts in
the ' Far :: Western country. I rode a
-two- pound wheel all the way, and
was not bothered a bit by having to , dis
mount for repairs." '

ASTORIA, Ob., July 3Lâ Receipts of
salmon at the various lower river can
neries are unusually heavy and far in ex
cess of the capacity of the packing es
tablishments to handle them.
To-day fish was so plentiful that one of
the fishermen delivered nearly 100, and ii
was reported that near Sand Island the
water was alive with large .cbinooks.
Many were taken with gaff-hooks by men
who found themselves in the ? midst of ] a
large school of fish;
At some canneries the loss is very heavy,
tona of fine fish ; being thrown overboard
on account â¢"â  of the lack of facilities ; for

seen, and if it continues until the close
of the season â¢ there will ; be a much larger

are of exceptionally fine color and quality.

Union Iron Works Bid Re
quested by the Naval Con
struction Board.
THE CHABLESTON IMBRCGLIO.
S-cretary Herbert Will Not Call a
Court-Martial to Try Captain
Col fin.
WASHINGTON, D. C. July 31.â The
Naval Bureau of Construction and Repair
sent out to-day copies of plans and speci
j fications for the battle-snips whose con- j
! struction is authorized in the last naval j
appropriation law. The copies went to j
; four firms â Cramps, the Union Iron i
Works, the Baih Iron Works and the i
Newport News Ship-fcuilding Company, j
j These firms a*e the only ship-bailding
establishments in the United States that
made applications for plans and specifica
tions. The fact that they entered applica
tions is no indication, however, that all
will submit bids, it is believed at the de
partment that three at least will make
proposals, two of them for all three ships
and one for two.
There is a disposition on the part of the
authorities at the present time to dis
j triDute the contracts for the ship*. Under
the law one of these vessels must be built
on the Pacific Coast, provided the bid sub
mitted by the firm or firras bidding from
that section is not too much in excess ol
the bids submitted by Eastern nrms. The
j probabilities are strong, therefore, that the
! Union Iron Works will obtain a contract
i for the construction of at least one ship, ,
j although the members of that firm say it â 
; intends to make proposals for tne con
i struction of all three.
Information has reached the Navy De
' partment that the cruiser Brooklyn wiil j
\be ready for trial by August 20. Edwin j
Cramp of Cramp <fe Sons was at the Navy '
Department a few days ago making ar- 'â 
rangements for the conduct of the trial. \
| The exact date has not yet been selected, |
f but it is to occur about the time men- ,
j tioned. It is expected that the depart- j
ment will issue orders to some member of j
| the Board of Inspection and Survey, i
| directing him to repair to the New Eng- j
! land coast to plat off the course over I
I which the cruiser is to run, which is to be
j between CapÂ« Ann and Cape Porpoise, i
When the course has been laid off orders j
will be issued to the Board of Inspection ]
! and Survey directing it to repair to Boston
and there to hold itself in readiness to j
: conduce the trial.
Secretary Herbert will witness the trial, j
: Other officials of the Navy Department, j
i among them Chief Naval Constructor â 
Hichborn and Engineer-in-Chief Melville, t
will also attend.
The Brooklyn is required by her specifica- I
tions to make a speed of twenty knots in j
! order to be accepted. It is the general
. belief tnat she will make aoout twenty- {
i two knots per hour for the four hours re- j
| quired. In this event she will win a i
i handsome bonus for her builders.
Secretary Herbert has settled the
Charleston incident. He has written a
â  letter to Captain Coffin, calling his atten- j
I tion to the fact that he should not nave
j purchased foreign coal for his vessel at j
; Honolulu, without having first given the
j Government coal kept there an exhaustive ,
j teat When the report first reached the
department that the Charleston had se
cured a supply of foreign coal. Secretary j
! Herbert called upon Captain Coffin for an I
j explanation. That officer wrote to the ,
! department stating that such action had
| been taken on the recommendation of
I Charles M. Macconnell, chief engineer of
the ship, who informed him that the
Pocahontas coal on the Government pile
was too fine and not suited for the Charles
ton's boilers. Upon this statement
Captain Coffin approved the recommenda
tion for the purchase of foreign coal.
Secretary Herbert, after considering the
matter, decided that a court of inquiry
was too expensive. He therefore wrote to
Captain Coffin calling his attention to the j
matter, and admonishing him to make
further investigation before taking such
action again.
He also decided that it was unnecessary
to institute any proceedings against the
two other officers of the Charleston who
wen alleged to have been implicated in
the affair. The purchase of coal by an- j
other ship was also the subject of censure
by Secretary Herbert. The vessel was the
Raleigh, which secured a supply of fuel at
New Orleans. It was not the kind of coal
the department desired the vessel to have,
and Captain Merrill Miller had his atten
tion called to the matter in a communica
tion addressed to him by the Secretary.
The Newark dropped down to Tom pkins

pectemthat the Columbia, which left New
Brunswick, Ga., to-day, will arrive at
Tompfcinsvilie, to-morrow.
The Massachusetts wiil probabiy not be
able to join the squadron for some weeks.
She will leave League Island on Monday
next for Newport News, and after taking
on board supplies at that point, will pro
ceed to Newport for her torpedo outfit.
The battle-ship Texas will also be unable
to join the squadron for some time. She
was ordered to leave for Tom pinks vilie
yesterday, bnt failed to get away.
The battle-ship Maine left Key West to- ]
day for Newport News, where she is to â 
have hei bottom cleaned arid painted. Sbe
will probably join Admirai Bunce's fleet
in the course of a couple of weeks.
The Philadelphia arrived to-day at Port
Angeles, joining the Monadnock which
arrived at that place a couple of days ago.
These vessels will await the arrival of
the Bennington and Monterey and will
then proceed to the 3traits of Fuca, where
they will engage in maneuvers. The
Alert will join them later.
Among the coast arrivals are Henry

TWO FRACTURED SKULLS
Justice Griest of Reedley Thrown
From His Cart and
Killed.
James Dinan of Fresno Falls From a
Horse and Is in a Dying
Ccniition.
FRESNO, Cal., July 31.â Peter Griest,
Justice of the Peace at Reedley, was
thrown from a cart in whicn he was riding
and killed to-day. The fatality happened
in Reedley, in front of a blacksmith-shop.
Judge Griest was driving a fractious horse,
which became frightened at a windmill at
the side of the street and ran away. The
aniiral ran into a vacant lot adjoining the
sr op, where a big farm wagon stood.
Griest's horse dashed the cart against the
wagon with ouch iorce as to throw the
Judge out on the ground. He struck on
his head, and wher. people arrived a few
minutes later be was breathing his last.
The base of the skull had been badly frac
tured.
Coroner Long went to Reedley this even
ing and held an inquest. The verdict of
the jury was accidental death.
Judge Griest was 45 years of aze at the
time of his death. He was one of the
leading citizens of Reedley, having been a
resident there for many years. He was
one of the leading Republicans in the
county. He leaves a famiiy.
Judge Grieat was an experienced horse
man, and how the horse could gee beyond
his control is not known. He ought at
least to have been able to tarn his horse
away from the wagon and thus avoid the
fatal accident. It is supposed tuat the
unfortunate man let a line sl : p and in this
manner the horse got away from him.
James Dinan, an employe of the Fresno
Canal and Irrigation Company, was to-day
fatally injured by being thrown from a
horse while engaged in cleaning the bot
tom of the canal of rubbish three miles
east of this city. The horse was hooked
to the end of a cnain, which was dragging
the bottom of the stream. Dinan was
riding the horse and went to turn down a
steep embankment. As lie did so tha
horse stumbled and threw him off. He
struck on his head and the base of the
skull was fractured. Dinan was picked up
in an unconscious condition and brought
to his home in this city. He is still un
conscious to-night and will die. Dinan
was formerly wealthy. He Is 37 years of
age and has a wife and child depending
upon him for support.

I involved.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 31.â Judge Lori
ean this raornine rendered judgment for
plaintiff in the suit ot Amelia Lonpe
against Sidney M. Smith of San Francisco !
to quiet title to 175 acres of land near Ever- j
green. The property is worth between !
$40 r OOO and $50,000. Mrs. Loupe's title to i
the land was not disputed, but Smith j

Loupe, by the terms of which sue agreed j
to give him a conveyance of the property
in consideration of $15,000 in cash and a j
deed to a number of lots in the neighbor- i
hood of the Hotel Vendome. Afte: tnak- ;
ing the agreement, Mrs. Loupe claimed i
that the title to a portion of the lots was
defective and repudiated her contract.
Mrs. Loupe was on the stand for a short j
time. Documentary evidence as to her I
title to the property was also presented. I
Judge Lorigan ordered a decree for plain

SHOT AT SPOKANE

Rich Estate.
ACCUSED OF IMMORALITY.
Afterward Seeks an Explanation, Is
Met With a Blow and the
Tragedy Follows.
6POKANE, Wash., July 31.â L. H. Plat
tor, one of the most prominent lawyers in
the Northwest, was shot and killed in the
corridor of the courthouse at 5:30 this
afternoon by Henry Seiffert, a prominent
restaurant and saioonman. They had just
come out from the courtroom wnere Plat
tor, as an attorney, had made remarks
uncomplimentary to Seiffert. The men
walked down the corridor, when, it is said,
Seiffert held out his hand to Plattor, the
men being both Elks, and said, "I'll show
you that you are all wrong in your state
ments about me."
Then it is said Plattor struck him with
a cane on the side of the head. Seiffert
pulled his gun and shot Plattor in the left
arm, the bail coming out on tlie right side
of the neck. Plattor staggered forward for
ten feet before ne fell, leaving a trail of
blood along the corridor.
Your correspondent was in the corridor,
and, springing forward, caught the dying
man as ne struck the floor. He did not
utter a word, dying in less tnan half a
minute. Seiffert, with Major Gwydir, who
stood beside him during the shooting,
wafted down stairs to the Sheriff's office
aniPgave himself up, but the gun was not
upon his person when searched and no
one knows where it is to be found.
The shooting was witnessed by a num
ber of lawyers who had been attending
the case on trial. Word of the shooting
spread rapidly over tne town and caused
intense excitement on account of the
prominence of the parties, and this even
ing knots of men are gathered on the
street corners talking of the matter. The
cause of the shooting was insinuations
made by Piattor against the character of
Seiffert.
A tew days ago Rudolph Gorkow, a rich
brewer, died, leaving a will but cutting off
his widow, formerly a variety actress
(Helene Edwards, or McKeniie), with $1.
She applied for a special administrator
and it had been agreed that Seiffert wouid
be appointed. To-day when the matter
came up in court attorneys for the ben
hcia rias under the will made great ob
jections and intimated that Seiffert was
not a proper person. Plattor, one of tne
attorneys, told the court that he had a bad
character and intimated that he had been
secretly living with Helene Gorkow, the
widow, before the death of Gorkow.
This angered SieHert in the courtroom,
but he said nothing, and when the case
was over he was supposed to be cooled
down, and it is said by those close to him
in the corridor that he made friendly
overtures to Plattor, who refused them.
An inquest will be held to-morrow
morning. Meantime Sieffert is in jail, al
though it is thought he can get bonds for
any sum, as he has a great many friends.
Plattor leaves a widow and has a brother
now traveling in California. He was one
of the most prominent Democrats in the
Northwest, having held several positions.
At the same time be was a brilliant
speaker and had stumped the State several
times, carrying convictions by his elo
quence. His wife went into hysterics over
the affair and is said to be in a dangerous
condition.
The wife of Sieffert ia also in a bad con
dition and fainted when informed of the
shooting. Nothing has occurred here in
years that has caused as great excitement
as this. ____^^_______
BRITISH COLUMBIA'S WOES.
Wind*, Flood*, Fir** and Drought
Sapping Her Retource*.
VANCOUVER, B. C, July 3LâAl
though British Columbia is seldom if ever
affected with destructive winds or dam
aging storms she now has more than her
share of trouble from discordant elements. |
Too much water has destroyed her crops
along the flooded Fraser Valley. The
serious results arising from the floods
are scarcely considered before a protracted
period of dryness or lack of water has
caused devastating fires and drying-up of
crops.
On Sumas Mountain, up the Fraser,
several settlers have been burned out. At
Alberni the York mining claims have
sufferei, and many thousand dollars'
worth of damage has been wrought along
the line of the Nanaimo and Esquimalt
railrosd.
On toe northern coast several logging
camps have Deen burned out and magnifi
cent timber limits destroyed.
To the south, alone the line of the Great
Northern Railroad, in United States terri
tory, barns, fences and railroad-ties are
being destroyed.
Besides the destructive fires crops are
suffering very much, particularly at
Comox, where it is stated that nearly all
growing crops of fruit, vegetables and
grain are being burned up by the sun. If
rain does not come soon further serious
damage is bound to result.

SENSROLS` DAILY PAPER.
Spicy Little Sheet Edited. Owned and

PORTLAND, Ob., Jnly 31.â This city
now bears the disi v.ction of being the
only place in the United States where a
daily newsboys' paper is printed, circu
lated and issued as a business proposition
by the little fellows themselves who sell
papers for a livelihood. The first sample
copy with prospectus is out and regular
issue will begin Monday. It is an after
noon daily, less than the size of half an
ordinary newspaper page and has three
columns to the page. The editors, re
porters and correspondents, are all "de
kids," as the salutatory announces.
For a long time tke newsboys have sup
ported two newsboys' vrceklies â the News
boy and the Calamity Howler. Recently
they consolidated, and henceforth their
daily, the Evening Newsboy, will do bat
tle for the rights of the new.Â»carrier. The
venture seems to be an assured success, as
subscribers cannot resist the appeals of
the boy 3.
In tne field of journalism it is a unique
thing, and the only position that an adult
has anything to do with is that of treas
urer an<l business manager, filled by John
F. Cordray, the well - known theatrical
man, who* was selected by the young
stockholder*. The Evening Newsboy an
nounces its determination to root up rot

SNOW MOUNTAIN
RED WITH BLOOD
Cattlemen Meet Sheepmen
in a Fight for Su-
premacy.
FIVE MEN ARE KILLED.
Culmination of a Fend That Has
Existed for Many
Years,
TWO COLLISIONS IN ONE MONTH.
Authorities Will Now Take Action
to Prevent a Recurrence
of the Trouble.
FOSSIL, Ob., July 3Lâ J. M. South has
just brongnt word of a desperate battle
between sheepmen and cattlemen on SnÂ»w
Mountain, southwest of Canyon City, in
Grant County, which took place about a
week ago. Mr. South was at Muddy Sta
tion when the Mitchell-Antelope stage
driver brought word to Mr. O'NeU, mana
ger of the Prinevllle Sheep and Land
Company, that Mr. Kitchen, one of the
company's employes, was one of three
sheepmen killed, two - cattlemen - being
also slain. Another of the sheepmen
killed was Ernest Sherar, a nephew of
Joseph Sherar, the well-known wool
grower and buyer. Young Sherar waa
known to a number of Fossil people as
the pitcher of the Antelope Baseball Clnb.
For years be has been buy ins and shipping
sheep for his uncle, and on the occasion of
the battle he with several others, includ
ing Mr. Kitchen, was driving a band of
sheep across the country to the railroad,
presumably to Huntington for shipment.
Tnere have been so many fake "sheep
fights" in Grant County this year that
this may be ltÂ£e the others â simply made
up in order to scare sheepmen from going
into the mountains with tneir flock, but
this story in that it gives the names of
somes of the killed ana was accepted as
true by Mr. ONe 1 ! has symptoms of truth
in it.
The fight took place on Snow Mountain.
and was a continuation of the war that has
been raging for some time in that part of
Oregon. This battle was one of the most
desperate and bloody that has yet taken
place.
There has been hard feeling for a long
time between the cattle and sheep men in
that part of Oregon. Numberless disputes
have taken place over the possession and
use of the ranges, the cattlemen asserting
that the sheep drove the cattle from tho
ranges. There has been much bard talk,
bnt until recently no bloodshed. Within
the past month, however, there have been
two bloody fignts. It is thought probable
that the authorities will now take some
action to prevent a recurrence of the
trouble.

Great Consternation Among
Democrats and Silver
Men.
OVERTURES REFUSED.
Ex-District Attorney Dillon of
Los Angeles Is Out for
Congress.
PEOPLE'S PARTY
A Socialistic Orator Challenges
Stephen M. White to a
Political Debate.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July Sl.âLead
ing members of the Silver party of this
Congressional district have been in con
ference here to-day with Democratic dele
gates to the Ventura convention in the
hope of devising some plan for a fusion of
all the anti-Republican factions in order
to defeat Nominee McLachlan. The acticn
of the Populists yesterday in declaring for
independence and a nominee of their own
has created consternation in the Silver
and Democratic rantcs, for it is well known
that without united action Congressman
McLachlan is sure of re-election.
Ex-District Attorney Dillon is pretty
sure of the Populist nomination. Dillon
is a strong and able man, but the Demo
crats insist tnat this is their year to name
the nominee, and that the Populists are
acting in bad faith with their amiable
neighbors and former coadjutors, when
Marion Cannon waÂ» nominaud and sub
sequently indorsed by the Democrats in
the interest of Senator White.
The silver men made little or no progress
in favor of their pet theory fcr a union of
forces.
SOCIALISTIC GOLDRUGS
Job Harriman Throw* Down the Gaunt
let to White and Berry.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., July 31.â The
socialists of this county occupy a unique
position on the money question. They are
about tbe only organization of laborers in
this community who are stanch support
ers of the single gold standard. Job Har
riman, who some months ago conducted
a debate with Congressman Maguire in
Metropolitan Temple, San Francisco, is
their leading orator and thinker. Mr. Har
riman issued the following open challenge
here this afternoon: "I hereby challenge
either Hon. Stephen M. White or Colonel
John R. Berry to a public discussion of
the following question: 'Will the free
coinage of silver in the United States of
America at the ratio of 16 to 1 with gold
benefit the wage-earning class?' 1 will
negative the subject. Respectfully, J.
Harriman."
SANTA CLARA DEMOCRATS.
Weary of Waiting for Futionittt, They
Will Get Down to Work.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 31.â The Demo
cratic County Central Committee will hold
a meeting early next week and take steps
toward party organization in the county.
The delay has been occasioned by tbe un
settled condition of the National ticket.
As there seems to be no hope of one of
the Vice-Presidential candidates being
withdrawn, the local Democrats are
anxious to perfect tbe party organization
in the county and get down to work.
Thomas C. Hogan, chairman of the
Democratic County Central Committee,
says he has received overtures from a
large number of individual members
of the local Populist party to join in cele
brating the ratification of tbe National
Democratic ticket. Chairman Hogan says
there is a slight disposition among the
Democrats to fuse with the Populists on
the National ticket if one of the Vice-
Presidential candidates is dropp.d, but
that no concessions will be made to the
Populists on a legislative ticket.
WOMAN SUFFRAGISTS.
Planning for Effective Campaign Work
in Southern California.
LOri ANGELES, Cal., July 81.â The
different woman suffrage committees of
Southern California, it is understood, are
planning to do some very effective cam
paign work in behalf of the eleventh
amendment by forming allied women's
clubs to the old parties. The plan, it is
argued, will be perfectly consistent, owins
to tne fact that the Republicans, Populists
and Prohibitionists all put a worran-suf
frage plank in their State platforms, and
that while the Democracy refused this,
many of the delegates from this end of the
State favored it and are stanch support
ers of the movement. It is considered
"good politics" to work in connection
with instead of independent of tbe pres
ent organized political parties.
AN ABANDONED RAILROAD

SAN DIEGO, Cal., July 31.âSuperin

OREGON'S FIERCE FOREST FIRES
thousand* of Cord* of Wood Consumed
and Town* Threatened.
PORTLAND, Or., July 31.â Word is re
ceived from Oak Point, fifty miles down
the river, that a fierce forest fire is raging
in the canyon there.
Between 1000 and 1200 cords of wood be
longing to Hogne & Young have already
been destroyed. It is supposed that the
fire was started from the campflre of some
fishermen up the creek.

feet to-night while making a parachute
balloon ascension. He struck in a tree,
crashed through it and landed on the
stone sidewalk. He was picked up uncon
scious and conveyed to the hospital. No
bone 9 were broken, but he is suffering
from severe internal injuries, and his re
covery is in doubt. The fall was caused
by the breaking of the irons connecting
the horizontal bar to the parachute. Over
a thousand people witnessed the fall.
SHERIFF DUGGLASM DEATH.
Result of the Coroner's Inquest Held at
Xevada City.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., July 31.â At the
Coroner's inquest to-day in the case of the
late Sheriff Douglass it developed that a
44-caliber rifle shell was found yesterday
afternoon thirty-five feet from where the
dead Sheriff's body lay. It is thought that
it was fired by a pal of the dead robber,
and that he stood behind a tree while
shooting. The Coroner's jury returned a
verdict that "Sheriff Douglass came to his
death frem a gunshot wound inflicted by
some one unknown to the jnry, an accom
plice of the dead robber." The officers are
still looking for the iugitive robber, and it
is understood that they have strong evi
dence against a party who is supposed to
be in this neighborhood.

alias James Parker (colored), was cap
tured by Constable Coleman near town

TALE OF SKAGGS SPRINGS
Thrilling Adventure of a Santa
Rosan With a Buck He
Had Wounded.
Tossed on the Antlers of His Prey,
but Saved From Death by His
Knife.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., July 31.â A tale of
adventure from Skaggs Springs, in which
an angry buck deer and a badly frightened
hunter were the principals, is related by
ex-Sheriff John F. Mulgrew.
It seems that Bob Mason, a mighty hun
ter of Northern Sonoma, had wounded a
I fine male deer, and according to custom
the animal made its way to the deepest
pool of water in Squaw Creek. The hun
ter followed rapidly and in his great haste
stumbled and fell into the pool with the
I crippled buck. The frenzied animal lost
{ no time in making a vicious attack on the
hunter, who managed to crawl upon a lo t ?.
The deer swam directly up to the log and,
lowering his big antlers, tossed man and
log high into the air.
The hunter's rifle lay at the bottom of
the pool, but he still had a razor-edged
butcher knife to aid him in his fight for
life, and when he descended from his
aerial flight he used the keen weapon with
good effect. Another terrific charge from
the buck sent the hunter high in air again
and landed him behind his antagonist in
tbe water. From this point of vantage he
was able to straddle the animal's back,
and, reaching over, drew the keen edge of
his knife across the creature's throat.
Mason was completely exhausted when
found by Mr. Mulgrew and required as
sistance in getting borne.* The buck was
I a four- pointer and dressed 132 pounds.

number of postmasters in the couutry
about this city have been carrying on a
land-office business with merchants here
by the use of postage stamps as cash. The

GOLD HILL, Nev., July 31.--Tne Piute
residents of this county are intensely ex
cited over the appearance on the outskirts
of this town this afternoon of two Washoe
Indians, who were armed and evidently
bent on mischief, and to-night the Indian
village is deserted, the squaws and old
Indians having sought protection of the
whites in town and the bucks being in the
hills on the lookout for trouble.
Ever since the killing of V; young Piute
buck by one of the Washoe tribe, in Reno
a few days ago, the old hatred between the
two tribes has burned wit'a renewed
ferocity ; and *an i outbreak ; has : , been ex
pected by those whites who know all the
circumstances. ' Still nobody was prepared

THE WARRIMOO`S FAST TRIP.
Bring* Xew* of the Earthquake* in the
South Sea Islands,
VICTORIA, B. C, July 31.- Advices by
the Warrimoo to-night indicate that the
tidalwave which so grievously desolated
Japan in June also visited New Hebrides
and other islands of the South Seas, ex
citing consternation among the natives
but doing no material damage.
Among the passengers was Dr. Hull,
who comes to America in the interest of
the Queensland Government to obtain a
remedy for the tick curse that is now
afflicting the flocks of the colonies;
another passenger being Captain Mc-
Hardy of the lost bark Scottish Dales, en
route to Liverpool to report to the owners.
The Warrimoo made a flying trip across,
reducing the record to America by two
hours.

A PECULIAR DEATH.
Question as to Whether Herman Faber
Committed Suicide or Was Acci
dentally Suffocated.
Herman Faber, Benior member of the
firm of Kiefer & Co., liquor-dealers, corner
of Battery and Sacramento streets, was
found dead in his room at 520 Laguna
street last evening at 7 o'clock. Deceased,
who had been ill for several days, was ly
ing on the bed, and a steady stream of gas
from an open jet was flowing into the
room.
The caHS is a peculiar one. Leopold M.
Faber, father of the dead man, is of the
opinion that his son accidentally turned
the gas on and then went to bed and to
sleep, and in consequence was suffocated.
Deputy Coroner Hallett, however, is posi
tive that it is a case of
suicide, and tne parents of the
deceased are reticent regarding their
son's death, and considering the manner
in which the case was reported to the
Coroner the latter theory is in nil prob
ability correct. "A man purporting to be
v Dr. Buchanan called me by tel*Â»Dhone
last evening at 11 o'clock." said Deputy
Coroner Hallett, "and informed me that
my services were required at 520 Laguna
street.
"He stated that Herman Faber had been
suffocated by gas, either accidentally or
that -he had committed suicide. I took
my wagon and went out to the nouse for
the purpose of removing the body to the
Morgue. The father was inclined to keep
the facts regarding the manner of his
son's death secret.
"He informed me that I had no au
thority to call at his house at such an un
seemly hour, and told me to call again on
the morrow. I then informed him that
unless I was apprised of the facts in the
case I would have to remove the body to
the Morgue.
"He then told me part of the story re
earding the rinding of the body and in
sisted that I should leave it in the house.
.Not wishing to create a scene I did so, but
asked him to direct me to the physician
who had been railed in at the time the
body was discovered.
"He told me that he called in Dr. Bu
chanan, who lived just across the street.
I then scoured the neighborhood in search
of a doctor by that name, but none was
to be found. Neither is there a physician
by that name in any of the directories or
the Coroner's list of physicians practicing
in this City. It is a peculiar case, and de
mands a thorough investigation."

BUSINESS FALLING OFF
Black Ryan Uses His Persuasive
Eloquence on the
Equalizers.
EVASIVE ON SOME QUESTIONS
The Board Determines to Pursue the
Assessment Methods of Last
Year.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 31.-The
Pullman Palace-car Company and the
Southern Pacific Company appeared be
fore the Board of Equalization to-day.
J. P. Meehan, the Pacific Coast manager
of the Pullman Company, asked that the
taxes on their rolling stock be prorated,
taking into consideration tne number of
cars used between here and Chicago, the
number or miles to Chicago, the number
of miles of road upon which the cars oper
ated in California, the value of the cars
and the interest of the Southern Pacific
Company in the rolling stock.
Meehau stated that the company was
assessed for the whole value of the prop
erty in Illinois and retaxed in all the
States in which the cars were used.
E. Black Ryan appeared for the South
ern Pacific Company, including tne lines
of the Southern Pacific, Central Pacific,
Northern Railway, California Pacific,
Northern California Railway, South Pa
cific Coast arid Southern California Motor
road.
Before the discussion of the assessments
generally Ryan was asked in regard to the
separate assessment asked by the Atlantic
and Pacific Company of the Mojave divi
sion.
Ryan stated he had no objections if the
whole Southern Pacific system was also
divided into divisions and assessed inde
pendently.
The board determined to pursue the
method used last year and assess the
branch with the system as a whole.
Ryan's argument for a reduction on the
Central Pacific was very short. He stated
that the deficiency created last year
amounted to $78,160, and asked for a re
duction, not specifying the amount asked.
J. T. Klink, controller of disbursements,
was sworn and examined as to the gross
income per mile of the Southern Pacific
system. The returns sbowed an income
of $6292 per mile in 1895 and $9889 per mile
in 1894. Toe falling off of $3107 per mile
Klink accounted for by stating that the
ferry earnings were taken into considera
tion in making up the statement of 1894,
but not in 1895.
Attention was called to the fact that the
office and headquarters expenses were re
turned as a whole, while in the specifica
tion made of the ferry's share in office ex
penses these expenses were subtracted
from the gross receipts to produce the net
income.
Ryan was unable to give a satisfactory
answer, merely stating that it was an over
sight.
Ryan compared the assessments on nar
row-gauge roads througbout the State
with that on the South Pacific Coast,
showing that the average assessment of
roads other than the South Pacific Coast
averaeed less than $5000 per mile, while
that road was assessed at $13,519 19.
Ryan will present himself for cross-ex
amination by the board this afternoon.

WILL BE LOW
Indications That the Figures
Will Be About
$i 05.
DEPARTMENTS REDUCED
The Health Board Will Receive
an Extra Seven Thousand
Dollars.
THAT SURPLUS IN EVIDENCE.
Mission Hgh School Estimate Cut
Out of the School Department
Demand.
Unless the Board of Supervisors choses
to alter th<? report of the Finance Commit
tee relating to the appropriations for the
municipal departments for the coming fis
cal year the tax levy which is about to be
fixed will not exceed $1 06 on the $100 and
will probably be $1 05 or 50 cents less than
last year.
The Finance Committee has worked
long and hard on tbe figures that it will
present to the board, Colonel Taylor
spending several nights over the books
with tbe expert of the board.
It was decided by the committee that
the demands of most of the departments
were excessive. The amount derived from
the large ievy of last year' had allowed
several departments to do a lot of neces
sary building and repairing that will ob
viate the necessity of spending much
money in those directions for some years
to come. Added to this was the universal
demand fora low levy, and it was con
cluded to shave demands wherever pos
sible.
It has been decided to cut the $300,000
allowed Golden Gate Park to $225,000 for
the next year, and the Street Department
will be compelled to get along with $475,
--000, $75,000 less than last year and $1,000,
--000 less than asked by Superintendent
Ashworth, if the committee's report be
adopted.
The committee feels that the $200,000
demanded by the School Department tor
a new high school for the Mission is some
what excessive, and that department will
be compelled to get along with $1,000,000,
or near iy $250,000 less than was asked. '
The Fire Department appropriation will
be about $25,000 less than last year, about
$60,000 being cut off the figures for hose
and apparatus, while other departments of
the service have been allowed more money.
The Health Department is the only one
allowed a substantial increase over last
year. If the committee's figures prevail
it will receive $7000 more than in 1895-96.
which will be sufficient to pay the salaries
of a number of employes who have not
previously been provided for. The hopes
of the board of -having a lot of fat Detron
a.e to dispense, in the way of additional
inspectors, were dashed, the committee
refusing to provide for t.ieir salaries.
In addition to the decreased necessity
for funds, there is the surplus left over
from last year to assist in holding down
the rate. The Auditor finished his calcu
lations of the amount left over in the
various funds yesterday and transmitted
it to the Finance Committee. It is as fol
lows:
General fund... f195,118 46
Street light fund 4,856 08
Police relief and pension fund 32,909 32
Di.iinterment lund 3,050 00
Street Department fund 9,719 73
T0ta1........ *244,653 59
There are claims outstanding against
the Street Department and police pension
.funds that will reduce the surplus to
about $200,000, but the residue will be
sufficient to save the taxpayers about 6
cents on the $100.
The three members of the Finance Com
mittee are determined to hold the rate
down, and will made a determined fight to
keep their report intact.
NO JOKE
Dr. Salfield Wants Baker Street Im
proved or License to Operate a
Team-Aiding Cable.
A committee of Oak and Page streets
and Ashbury Heights and Sunset Heights
property-owners appeared before the
Finance Committee of the Board of Super
visors yesterday afternoon to urge the pe
tition of the Association of Improvement
Clubs for the appropriation of $32,500 to
the Street Department fund, for the special
purpose of permanent street improve
ments on Oak street, between Baker and
Stanyan streets, and on Stanyan street,
between Haighi and Fulton streets. The
committee was headed by C. D. Salfie.ld,
president of the Panhandle Improvement
Club, who acted as spokesman. The
Finance Committee apparently did not
favor an increase of the tax levy, although
cognizant of the fact that the improve
ment of these streets has become an abso
lute necessity.
Oak street, which is the only thorough
fare which can bo used for heavy traffic
on account of its easy grades, ana which
is the only outlet to Ashbury Heights,
Sunset Heights and tne large territory
south of the park, has been for years in a
most outraeeous condition. In the winter
peason it is a river of mud and slush, and
the water during a storm is deep enough
between Cole and Baker streets to float
an ordinary sized boat very comfortably,
as has been repeatedly illustrated by Dr.
Salneld, who keeps a small navy for this
purpose. The traffic on Oak street is very
heayy in spite of its bad condition. The
vehicles keep as much as possible to the
car tracks, and generally don't oudge off
them, no matter how loudly the gongs of
th*> cars are b.Mng sounded; for once off
the car tracks they are sure to sink into the
ptr**t tin to the hubs and break down if
heavily loaded.
As it appeared to the property-owners'
committee that $32,500, asked for by the
Street Department and petitioned for by
the Association of Improvement Clubs,
would not be appropriated this year, and
that consequently the street will have to
remain for another year in the same dis
graceful condition, Dr. Salfield has applied
to the Board of Supervisor? for permission
to operate a cable on Baker street, between
Oak and Page, for the purpose of assisting
lieavilv loaded teams up the grade on to
Pajre street, the charge not to exceed 25
cents per load, and 5 per cent of th- gross
receipts to be paid into the Street Depart
ment Fund for the betterment of Oak and
Stanyan streets.
In an interview had with the doctor be
stared that be is aware that this petition
may appear as a huge joke, but that it i*
not*. He thints that such an arrangement
will surely pay expenses, and that it is an
absolute necessity". There is hardly a day
that numerous breakdowns do not occur,
and all teamsters acquainted with the con
diiion of the streets, especially luniber
trucks, carry only halt-loads to the district
' south of Oak aid west of Baker street.
' The doctor hopes that tne Board of Super
visors will grant the $32,560 to the Street
Department, which will nÂ«t increase the
taxes exceeding 1 cent, or that it will grant
him the permission of operating that cable
on Baker st.
ARCHBISHOP REDWOOD.
The Distinguished MarUt Will Preach
at the French Church on Bush
Street To-Morrow.
The Most Reverend Archbishop Red
wood of Wellington, New Zealand, who
arrived here on the Monowai Thursday,
will preach in English in the French Cath
olic Churchâ Notre Dame dcs Victoiresâ
on Bush street, near Stockton, at the 11
a. m. mass to-morrow.
His Grace is an eloquent ipeaker and
impressive orator, as well as a man dis
tinguished for his scholarly attainments.
On his last visit to San Francisco he de
livered a sermon at Notre Dame in the
presence of a coneregation that packed
that fashionable place of worship. On
this occasion there will be special music,
and it is expected that a very large con
gregation will hear the eminent prelate.
Archbishop Redwood is a member of the
Marist order, and consequemly is a guest
of the Rev. Father Gentes at Notre Dame.
He is accompanied by Monsignor
Broyer, Bishop-elect of Samoa, who
has spent twenty-two years as a
missionary priest among the South
Sea islanders. Monsignor, Also a Marist,
will be consecrated Bishop in Rome.
There are six Bishops, members of
the Marist order, in the South Sea islands,
and he will be the seventh. After leaving
here Archbishop Redwood and Bishoo
elect Uroyer will proceed to Salt Lake City
and visit the Marist College there, thence
to Milwaukee to meet Archbishop Ireland,
who was a classmate of Archbishop Red
wood in France for years. They will visit
the Marist College in Dundalk, Ireland,
and then go to Rome via Paris and Lyons.
STOOD FOR FREE SPEECH
The Labor Council Severely Cen
sures the Police Author
ities.
Talk of a Bakers' Strike or Boycott
Over a Ncn-Unioa Shop.
New Officers.
The San Francisco Labor Council held a
specially interesting meeting last night at
Federation Hali, 1159 Mission street. The
attendance was nearly double as large as
usual, for the reason that a semi-annual
election was held and several matters of
importance to labor unions were on the
list for discussion.
Delegate T. F. Burns from the Cigar
makers' Union moved that a letter be ad
dressed to all labor unions in San Fran
cisco through the daily press, inviting
them to participate with the Labor Coun
cil in the celebration of iÂ«abor day. An
amendment to the effect that each union
be invited by a letter from the secretary
was made, but Delegate Mac Arthur sug
gested that the committee of arrangements
was competent to attend to the Labor day
matter. The council had decided the
question, so he said, at a previous meeting.
It was eventually decided to instruct the
committee to invite labor unions to par
ticipate.
On motion of Delegate Bnrns the arrest
of a socialist Sunday night for speaking
on the street was referred to the law and
legislative committee. This action on the
part of the Doiice authorities was regarded
as a suppression of free speech. The com
mittee withdrew, and soon after presented
the following resolution:
Wherkas, Free speech is an Inalienable right
granted every American citizen in the un
trammeled exercise of which rests the safety of
our institutions, particularly at periods such
as the present, when the public mind is agi
tated by impending changes in the funda
mental law or the Nation; and whereas, the
police of San Francisco have arrested a public
speaker, Mark Leiter, in the streets of this
City, without law and in violation of every
principle of liberty and justice; and wherea*.
the said person has been tried and convicted
on the frivolous pretext of "obstructing the
street" and fined the sum of $5 by Judge
Joacbimsen, therefore we, the San Francisco
Labor Council, in regular session assembled,
denounce the action of the police and court as
a gross arrogation of authority and a subver
sion of tne exclusive right of the people to
make law to the function of the executive and
judicial officers ; and be it further
Resolved, ThÂ»t we call upon all citizens,
without regard to creed, color or party, to re
sent these encroachments as a menace to
liberty, and the fiist and most effective step
toward depriving the citizens of the dearly
bought and inestimable privilege of self-gov
ernment
Discussion of the proposed charter was
postponed for one week.
Communications were received from the
Municipal Reform League and the Mer
chants' Association offering assistance to
the council in considering the charter.
H. Blumer, D. W. Poole, D. J. Darr and
E. G. L. Hoeber were seated in the coun
cil as delegates from Typographical Union
No. 21 for the ensuing year. The other
delegates of this union are W. C. Acker
man, T. F. Foley, C. Â£. Hawkes and
George L. Taylor.
Tne following delegates were elected to
serve for the next six months as officers of
the council:
President, T. F. Burns; vice-president, J.
Hill; recording and corresponding secretary,
Ed Rosenberg; financial secretary, J. Walters;
treasurer, W. C. Ackerman; sergeant-at-arms,
Thomas t'lnnerty.

A delegate from ttie Bakers' Union re
ported that Dailey <fc Davis, proprietors of
the New England bakeries on Hayes, De
yisadero and Sixth streets, were employ
ing non-union men exclusively. The
Bakers' Union had endeavored to induce
Daily & Davis to employ union men or to
unionize their bakeshops, but without
success. The delegate asked that a com
mittee be appointed by the Labor Council
to confer with Dailey & Davis and report
the result of the meeting to the Bakers'
Union this evening. The council in
structed its executive committee to attend
to the matter.
Town Talk This Week
Contains a carefully written resume of that
engrossing question "Sixteen to One" and
other editorial matter of National and local
nterest. "Political Chat" deals entertain
ingly with the personalities of those who help
to keep the machine of politics in operation
and throws side lights on the doings of men
who would wield influence in municipal gov
ernment. "General Biff" bestows praise where
praise is due and handles the undeserving
without gloves. "The Social Whirl" contains
a charming portrait and sketch of Miss Marie
Robina Voorhies, as well as news of other
society people prominent in the local world of
fashion. Tom T. Lane's portrait appears upon
the front cover. Miscellany of a pleasing and
diversified character enlivens the pages of this
week's Town Talk, and the various depart
ments are edited with care, as usual. The
drama, music and "Saunterer" columns con
tain brisk comments and lively criticisms, the
latter, however, being tempered with justice,
which should be the underlying principle of
the spirit of criticism. Town Tali is a
thoroughly up-to-da'.e journal. â¢

ENGLISH CAPITAL
FOR RICH MINES
Australia and New Zea
land Have Been Re
ported On.
VISIT OF P. F. MARKS.
Sent by London "Financial News"
to Learn the True
Prospects.
WILL EXAMINE MINES HERE.
ls Very Favorably Impressed With
Districts in N w Zealand and
West Australia.
Percy F. Marks, special correspondent
and one of the proprietors of the great
Financial News of London, arrived heie
yesterday from Australia and New Zea-
Percy F. Marks, Special Correspondent of the London Financial News, Who Is
Furnishing Exact Information on Mining Districts and Indirectly Guiding
the Investment of Â£200,000,000 of Idle British Capital.
land, where he made a careful examina
tion of the several large mining regions
and sent from time to time exact esti
mates of ttyeir prospects to his paper, both
by cable and by mail.
He has come to the United States for a
similar purpose and will begin with the
Cripple Creek district, in Colorado.
The Financial News deals solely with
financial matters. It is a daily paper as
large as The Call, and has an attested cir
culation of 200,000 copies a day.
Its opinions in regard to business pros
pects are given grea* weight in financial
circles. As an example of this when Mr.
Woods sent word that a certain big district
of 80,000 acres in Australia, then receiving
a good deal of advertising as a mining dis
trict, was really only a good farming coun
try and nothing more, the shares fell a
quarter in value the day after the report
was published.
In another case a favorable report was
followed by an immediate advance of 50
per cent in the price of certain shares.
"There are Â£200,000,000 of British
capital available to-day to be invested
in stocks of some kind," said Mr. Marks
yesterday. "There is more money
floating around now in England to be in
vested than ever before. It is a condition
due to improvement in trade and to the
general wealth of England which is a
much richer country than most persons
have any idea of.
"Our mining news is aDsoiutely unique.
No trouble or expense is spared in getting
reliable information. You may judge of
that from the extent of my present trip.
I was traveling in Australia and New
Zealand for eight months, reporting reg
ularly by cable and sending letters.
"My impression is, after very careful in
vestigation as to the value of each mine
and after very lengthy conversations with
practical miners, some of whom have been
in the districts almost from the beginning,
that the real wealth of New Zealand cold
fields will be found on the deep levels.
â¢'There is one company in particular, the
Thames-Bauraki Gold Fields, an English
concern, with v very powerful board of
directors and immense financial resources,
which will bring back to the Thames dis
trict the most halcyon days. Before those
mines were flooded over 4,000,000 pounds,
not ounces, of gold were taken out of that
district.
"This company is spending Â£60,000 in
sinking a shaft 2000 feet and- is putting in
powerful pumping machinery. So bright
are the prospects and so much im
portance is attached to the prospects
of this particular mine, the 'Queen of
Beauty,' and so important is the business
likely to be in the future welfare of the
district, that the Government is contribut
ing half the cost of the work. The future
of New Zealand as a gold producing coun
try is highly promising, and I am glad to
say the mining industry there is being
worked and controlled by men of high
character and great experience.
"Some of the most prominent English
syndicates have gone in for this enterprise
to a very large extent. Before I left Aus
tralia I met representatives of big Berlin,
Paris and New York concerns sent there
to look for investments. I learned that
all ol them had sent home most favorable
reports.
"The best days are to come for the mines
of East Australia.
"l was never favorably impressed with
the gold districts of West Australia, and
with Hannan's district in particular. It
is about twenty-five miles from the Cool
gardie region and in the last year fur
nished three-fourths of the total gold out
put credited in the reports to Coolgardie.
A great rivalry exists between the two
districts, both of whicn now have railroad
connection with Perth, a port forty-five
mile? distant.
"The absence of water, the lack of fuel,
the scarcity of labor, and the increased cost
of every necessity of life in the whole
West Australia, district make it expensive.
They have to go down 600 feet before they
strike a reef and it costs from Â£10 to Â£14
a foot for sinking and timbering a shaft.
Mining is very much cheaper in New
Zealand, for there water is abundant.
"Between Â£20,000,000 and $25,000,000
has been invested in West Australia
minss, but the investment will not be a
poor one in the end. Traveling in West
Australia is one of the worst experiences
you can undergo. Comforts there
Â«re none; necessities are very few,
and prices are exorbitant. There
is no animal life, but there are some fleas,
bugs and other insects. Day by day the
district is being opened up now, and soon
the railroad is to be extended to the Men
zes district far to the northward from
Coolgardie, in what is called the bush re
gion â an arid waste.
"In New Zealand there are two great
mining regionsâ the Auckland tiistrict of
the northern island and the district of the
southern island, known as tne west coast.
The principal one of the Auckland district
is the Coromandel and Thames. About
ten or fifteen years ago it was at its height
"Then it collapsed after the great
alluvial deposits had been cleared off
When they got down to the reefs they
had neither the money nor the experience
to work with, but now by the new pro
cesses they are able to get a larger per
centage of the product."
Harry H. Woods, editor-in-chief ol the
Financial News, is an M. P. for St.
George's in the East, and was the first
man in England to start a daily financial
paper. He got his training on the New
Orleans Picayune, and was night editor of
a New York daily. He started the paper
in 1881.

length.
The general result of the conference was
that during the coming campaign in Cali
fornia the issue of protection is to be pre
sented as the ovexshado wine issue which
it is; that as regards the financial ques
tion it shall be treated strictly in ac
cordance with the Republican plat
form, which declares for the bi
metallic standard which is to be
acquired at the earliest possible
moment in accordance with an interna
tional agreement of the nations, among
which the United States is an integral
part of a great commercial whole, and that
the political prospects of California pointed
unerringly to the success of the National
Republican ticket.
This important conference was attended
by nearly all the members of the State
executive committee. Chairman Frank
McLaut'hlin presided and Secretary J. W.
R. Hipgins, Irving B. Dudley, Frank P.
Flint, H. Z. Osborne, John D. Spreckels
and most of the other members of the ex
ecutive committee were present.
Among the other leading Republicans
who attended by invitation were Congress
man Bowers and Congressman McLacblan,
who have been renominated for Congress
in the Seventh and Sixth districts respec
tively, and Congressmen Barbour, Jchn
son, A. G. Hilborn and Loud, who are
sure of renomination in the First, Second,
Third and Fifth districts.
Among others who were present were:
S. M. Shortridne. Irving M. Scott, W. W.
Montague, N. P. Chipman, Horace Davis,
Percy T. Morgan, R. B. Carpenter, M. M.
Estee, W. H. L. Barnes, Jacob H. Neff,
\V. R. Davis. P. H. Lilienthal, Senator
George C. Perkins, Senator S. C. Smith of
Kern County, Hervey Lindey and others.
Thit conference of the leading Repub
licans of California in session with the
State executive committee of the party
adopted and promulgated no particular
measures and took no definite action
which was put in the form of a resolution
or a motion.
The political situation, the prospects of
tne campaign, the proper policy and the
best campaign methods to be pursued by
the party in this State, were discussed dur
ing the four hours' afternoon session in
short speeches delivered by everybody
who has been mentioned as present. The
result was simply the general campaign
idea expressed above and in this general
plan of campaign everybody acquiesced.
The details and method of the campaign
was properly left to the State committee.
This morning the Republican State
Central Committee will meet in Golden
Gate Hall and at this meeting some im
portant measures relating to the campaign
may be adopted, although the general di
rection of the campaign will be left in the
bands of the executive committee.
BLAINE REPUBLICAN CLUB.
Large and Enthusiastic Meeting at
Knights of Red Branch
Halt.
The James G. Biaine Club met at the
Knights of the Red Branch Hall last
night.
Notwithstanding that the club has been
organized only two weeks, it has about
200 names on its rollbook, with a fair
prospect of adding 800 more before the Ist
of September.
President Desmond is in receipt of two
communications, one from the Richmond
District ancV one from the Potrero, invit
ing him to designate a night in the near
future at which" he will be present to as
sist in organizing new clubs in those
localities.
The routine business other than the
signing of the roll by new members, was
dispensed with in order that the members
might be entertained with an address by
Colonel Roberts on the question of the
"Free and Unlimited Coinage of Silver,"
as proclaimed by the man from Nebraska.
Colonel Roberts showed by facts and
figures that the free and unlimited coinage
of silver would be an injury to the labor
ing masses in this country.
Edward Burrows, Frank Rice, G. W.
Alexander and other speakers followed
much upon the same topics.

OFF TO SANTA CRUZ.
Enjoyable Outing to Take Place Under
the Personal Supervision of
Colonel Menton.
Chances for Sunday outings are plenti
ful, but Colonel W. H. Menton's select
family excursions have always been
famous for excellent management and
rational enjoyment. To-morrow the
colonel will accompany a party to Santa
Cruz by the narrow-gauge route, and
many of the best people now in town in
tend to take advantage of the chance to
enjoy a pleasant, safe trip, free from all
the drawbacks of the ordinary Sunday ex
cursion.
The party will leave the foot of Market
street at 7:45 o'clock in the morning, pro
ceeding to Santa Cruz direct, arriving
there about 11 o'clock. After spending
five hours by the shore the excursionists
will start for home at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, arriving in the City before 8.
A feature not to be disregarded is the ex
ceedingly low price of tickets. $2 being
charged for the round trip. Tickets may
be procured at the ftrry to-morrow morn
ing, or at the Soulhern Pacific Company's
offices under the Grand Hotel.
The Bryan Club.
The Bryan Democratic Club of the

I OR PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
rOK TICK-PRESI DENT-
GARRET A. HOBART, or New Jersey
EMOTION NOVEMBER S, 1893.
McKinley's talks to workingmen win
votes every time.
The Buckley lambs might as well go to
Livermore and gambol on the ranch.
There will be no benefit from free silver
under a free-trade rule, and that is what
Bryan, is after.
The defect of Bryan as a plagiarist is
that he never plagiarizes anything with
any sense in it.
This is the day to leave orders for The
Sunday Call and make sure of good react
ing for to-morrow. .
The campaign in the East has already
begun and it is high time to start the move
ment in California.
Whoever it is that has persuadeJ Bryan
to keep his mouth shut for awhile is a
dangerous Democrat.
When free silver raises prices and free
trade lowers wages where will the work
ingman lind a living?
If tbe courts can find a sentence that
will do justice to the Solid Seven the
people will be satisfied.
Between the tax-shirkers and the tax
eaters there is no show for the tax
payer unless he fights for it.
By the time the Democrats get their
band wagon harnps*el up the campaign
will be over and the battle won.
Corporations that shirk taxes have only
themselves to olame when the people re
gard thenr as hostile to the public wel
fare.
In refusing to follow suit to Sewall tbe
Populists acted rightly encugb, bnt can it
bo pos=il>le they thought \Vatson was a
trump?
Public indignation against corrupt offi
cials speak? eloquently at mass-meetings,
Inn to speak with force it must speak at
the polls.
Colorado Republicans will support Mc-
Kinley and Ilobnrt on the platform of
l>:otection, and another Bryan bubble has
burst in the air.
If the Eastern people could read their
wea'her signs nright they would see in
every cloudburst and every cyclone a
warning to come West.
The Republican National Committee has
wisely decided to begin the campaign
early. The enemy is demoralized, and
now is the time to knock him out.
T:;e admirers of Bryan are fond of call
ing him a broad man in th 1 ? hope probably
of setting the people to believe he is broad
enough to cover two platforms at once.
Eastern inventors wbo have been ex
jverimenting with rain-making machines
will find it more profitable this year to in
vent something to prevent cloudbursts.
As the choice for President lies between
a soldier statesman and a boy orator the
American people hardly need a campaign
of education to teach them how to vote.
Those fellows who are predicting an end
of the world in 1900 are undoubtedly
basing their prophecies upon the unwar
ranted assumption that Bryan will be
elected.
It will be noted that the delegations
that call on McKinley are mainly made up
of workincrmen who are interested in
American industry and the revival of
good wages.
Democracy, that fooled the people with
Iree trade, cannot fool them again with
free silver. The American workingman
will not be caught twice by the same
bunko-steerers.
The record of disasters in the East is
rolling up at a fearful rate, and before
long we may have to vary our subscrip
tions to California festivals by getting up
an Eastern relief fund.
Just about the time the campaign gets
tbe minds of the Eastern people heated tip
to a point that will make the atmosphere
seem cool tbe weather will take a twist on
itself and hit them with a blizzard.
In this contest to maintain the honor
of tbe Nation against the repudiationists
the sentiment of patriotism is united with
the interests of business in infusing the
supporters of McKinley with a true an
thusiasm.
Intelligent advocates of free silver coin
age are beginning to see that the surest
way to promote the cause is by tbe estab
lishment of international bimetallism, and
as a consequence Republican bolters are
coming back into line even in tbe great
silver States of Colorado and Nevada.
THE DIFFERENCE
The Mexican Financier, an industrial
and financial journal published in tbe
City of Mezico, says: "As. for luxuries,
our working people do not strive for themâ
they are not used to them and do not de
mand them." The Financier adds, by
way of explanation, that the working peo
ple, including skilled labor, are not ambi
tious for homes and the higher comforts
of life as the wage-earners of the United
States are.
isow, what the Financier really means is
that low wages paid in cheap money is
calculated to dull the natural appetite of
a man for a comfortable existence, and
that when a man is "educated" to not
crave luxuries or even the ordinary com
forts of life bis ambition is too nearly
cruÂ»hed to death to inspire him to want a
home of his own, or to aspire to be any
thing higher than a mere human labor
performing machine.
The Financier does not say whether or
not Mexican working people are supposed
to have souls, but the presumption is that
they are not supposed to have anything
of the Kind. Any way, the Financier gives
a very correct picture of the condition of
the working class in the silver monometal
lic country of Mexico.
The other day a large delegation of
working people from that immense indus
trial district of which Pittsburg is the cen
ter called upon Mr. McKinley at his home
jn Canton to assure him that not only
themselves but the working class gen
erally fully appreciate tbe bold stand he
has taken to still further advance the in
terests of the wage-earners of the United
States. These men who wafted upon Mr.
McKinley are not the kind the Mexican
Financier refers to. They demand and
they strive for luxuries, and they are am
bitious to be in a position where they may
participate in the wealth accumulations
of the country. Did Mr. McKinley teil
them that they should not get used to
living like human beings and then they
would not striveâ Tould not be ambitious
to enjoy the comforts of life? Mr. Mc-
Kinley assured them, but they already
knew it to be true, that the party he rep
resents aims to conduct the affairs of the
Government in line with the policy that
"will serve the highest and best interests
of American labor, American agriculture,
American commerce and American citi
zenship."
Mr. McKinley told them, inferentially
at least, that they should demand oppor
tunity to strive for whatever is their due
as American citizens. The burden of Mr.
McKinley's speech to the delegation of
workingmen was that the head and front
of the strength of our system of govern
ment lies in honest effort on the part of
the Government to protect, encourage and
strengthen the hands of the Nation's
wage-earners. Had Mr. Bryan addressed
the delegation of working people he would
have said that our wage-earners do not
want protection against the pauper labor
of other countries, but that they do want
Mexico's monetary system, which is sil
ver monometallism "without waiting for
the consent of any other Nation."
ENGLAND AND M'KINLEY
On ge neral principles it is safe for this
country to do in a commercial way exactly
what England advises should not be done.
At this particular time British news
papers and manufacturers are volunteer
ing a good ddearl r of political advice to the
people of the United States, especially
concerning what the attitude of this
country ought to be toward Mr. McKin
ley's candidacy for tbe Presidency. The
Duihj Argus, a newspaper published at the
great English manufacturing town of
rÂ»r?ilforu, bewails the almost certainty of
the United States returning to protection,
and it refuses to LÂ»e comforted. It says the
re-enactment of the law of 1890 would
surely revive business in America ana
give tue country a very much stronger in
dustrial and financial position. Quite a
number of other British journals are of
the same opinion, and they all agree that
the election of McKinley would be a
notification to English industrial plants
that their products are not wanted, be
cause American plants would keep the
markers supplied with their own make of
goods.
The wool-dealers as well as the manu
facturers of woolen goods are very much
averse to the election of Mr. McKinley,
and not without cause. During the last
year of the operation of the McKin
ley tariff act our faotories took only
3*,. c .00,000 pounds of Liverpool wool,
and in the first year of the
Wilson act they took 109,500,000 pounds,
and our dealers in woolen goods imported
$41,000,000 more of them in the first year
of the Wilson tariff than in the last year
of the McKinley law. In view of these
facts it is not surprising to see England
advocating the defeat of Mr. McKinley.
Bnt wool and woolen goods are only two
items of the long list of British made
articles of trade that will have to pay a
good ronnd tax to enter our markets when
Mr. McKinley in President. The list in
cludes practically every industrial pro
duct, but not one article that we cannot
manufacture in this country, and largely,
too, from our own raw material.
But all Englishmen are not complain
ing about Mr. McKinley'i chances for
election. On the contrary, there is a very
large erniy of Britishers who are praying
for his election very much to the disgust of
their industrial neighbors. They are
Englishmen who are investors and who
have a great many million dollars in
vested in American railways, and they
argue that with protection tne volume of
domestic business would ba multiplied,
which in turn would largely increase the
traffic of the roads and thus insure them
larger returns on their investment. They
have no interest in British industries, but
they have money in employment in
America, and they know from experience
that protection in the United States
makes business lively, and that the
livelier it is the more their investments
in this country will earn. So it would
seem England has become a house divided
aeainst itself, so far as a protective tariff
in America is concerned.
SINNED THREE TIMES.
Horace Boies is the champion political
letter-writer. He writes in season and
out of season, but be generally says some
thing worth thinking about, albeit ho is
nearly always on the wrong aide of the
question he discusses. His latest epis
tolary effort is to the young lady who
made herself unduly conspicuous at the
Chicago convention by shouting for the
lowa candidate, and be tells her how it
was that the convention turned him down.
Mr. Boies tells the young lady that be bad
sinned three times against Altgeld, Bryan
and company. He went into the race for
the nomination under the condemnation
of the bosses and, of course, was handi
capped by them.
Mr. Boies' first offense was committed
in a speech before the Jackson Club of
Omaha in March, 1895, when he suggested
that there should be limitations as to the
legal tender of silver. For that attack
upon Bryan's plan for an unlimited vol
ume of silver coinage, war was immedi
ately declared against *he lowa statesman
THE SAX FKAXCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 1, 1896.
by the Nebraska Democratic silverites.
Altgeld, Bland, Tillmau and the othef
radical silverites approved of Bryan's at
tack upon Boies, which made the combi
nation of the ultras against him very
formidable. Mr. Boies was, in fact,
dropped from the list of advocates of
"free silver coinage of dollars without
limit or bust," and he received no invita
tions to address free-silver gatherings in
other States. He was not sound enough
on the unsound money question to com
mend him to the Bryan wing of the Demo
cratic party, and he was too unsound on
the sound money question to be trusted
by the Bourbon wing of the Democratic
party.
The next sin Mr. Boies committed was
in suggesting that "the party should not
be committed irrevocably to silver coin
age at 16 to 1," for that ratio "might prove
destructive of the present parity between
gold and silver," and, if so, "that
ratio should be abandoned and another
adopted." But, perhaps, the greatest sin
Mr. Boies committed and which exasper
ated Altgeld to a higher pitch of frenzy
than either of Ihe other sins was condemn
ing the destructian of property by the
Chicago rioters. Mr. Boies does not give
his young lady friend to understand that
ne is at ail sorry for committing the three
sins, but, rather, that he would like an
opportunity to commit them again. It is
very evident that the defeated lowan has
no use for the Chicago platform, nor for
any one who would indorse it, and were it
not that Mr. Boies is such a vacillating,
reeling and inconstant sort of a politician
he could do a great deal of good for his
State by returning to the party he aban
doned for Democratic piomises and stump
lowa for Major McKinley; and he may do
it, or, at least, he is likely to do a good
deal of damage to Bryan.
MONETARY FACTS.
"Popocrats" is the name that has been
given to the Democ-atic-Populist com
bine, and a very good name it is, too.
Well, the Popocrats are unfortunate in
making the free coinage of silver in any
event the paramount issue. The coun
tries which they expected to "point
with" as substantiating their claim that
ail a country has to do to make silver
dollars is to go to work and make them
are turning State's evidence very fast.
Mr. Bryan more especially has been calling
attention to the prevalence of silver as the
standard of value in South America to
show how easy it is for a Government to
do as it pleases in the matter of issuing or
coining money; but somehow his South
American witnesses are testifying the
other way.
To be sure the South American States
are not tumbling over one another in their
baste to adopt the monetary system of- the
United States, *ut they are doing it very
fast. Quite recently the Kepublics of
Chile, Venezuela, Salvador, Costa Rica,
San Domingo and British Honduras have
abandoned free silver coinage and estab
lished their money system on the basis
of gold as the ultimate redemption money,
exactly as it is done in this country. These
republics expect, however, to become
parties to an international monetary con
gress to establish an international stand
ard of gold and silver money, but, mean
while, they will make no further effort to
establish bimetallism independent of the
other commercial nations.
This leaves China, Japan, Mexico and
India as the only important free-silver
countries. Russia is still on a silver basis,
but the Government is getting ready as
fast a3 possible to revamp the system,
somewhat on the lines of our own. In ad
dition to the six South American republics
which have just changed the basis of their
money issues, France, Holland, Switzer
land, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, Germany,
England and Austria-Hungary are making
the yellow metal the standard money, and,
with the single exception of England,
every one of them is anxious to join with
the United Stated in establishing a bi
metallic standard of value.
In this connection the . significant fact
appears that in the so-called "gold coun
tries" silver is used â¢ for ; money in larger
quantities than in the strictly silver coun
tries, as the ! following table shows : -

"THE SUNDAY CALL."
Among many other attractive features
there will be discussed in the columns of
The Sunday Call the question: "Can
Trouble Be Killed by Suicide?" This is
not presented as a new issue. It is as old
as mankind, but there is no more im
portant, no more fascinating, no more
sensational question before the people to
dayânor will therÂ« ever be. It involves
the question of the human soul, the ques
tion of a hereafterâ the one question in the
world that at one time or another racks
the heart of every man and demands an
answer. You will find that The Sunday
Call will at least present the symposium
in a new manner. The opinions expressed
will be brief and to the point, and reasons
for and against the justification of suicide
will be given by thinking men and
women. You will not find this a dry
page of The Sunday Call. But if you
should â well, there are others, many
others, and each one of them contains
several bright things, strange things,
things of human interest, picturesque
things and good literature. Following is
a partial list of good things to ba found in

"Uncle Collis selfish eh? Why, the philos
ophy of life is nothing but the quintessence oi
selfishness," said S. H. Howland, the mining
man from Jackson, as he moved into a little
group that had formed round the register at
the Grand.
"Years ago six Senators and two Kepre
sentativen happened to be talking one evening
in the office of Wlllard's Hotel in Washington.,
and the conversation somehow drifted to a
discussion as to what is the philosophy of life.
Thoy talked and they talked and each one
presented some of the old theories, but all
agreed that they had not heard a samfactory
explanation. Over in a corner all by himself
sat an insipid-looking dandy. A dude they
would call him nowadays. He had rings on
his fingers, a waxed mustache and hair
parted in the middle. He was a general ob
ject of contempt, particularly to the Congress
men. Coming over to where they sat he said :
'Pardon me, gentlemen, 1 have not the honor
of your acquaintance, but I have been an inter
ested listener to your discussion. If you will
permit me I think I can explain the philoso
phy of life.'
"The men looked from one to another, their
eyes twinkling in expectation of making afooi
of the fellow and one of them said, 'Very well,
young man, go ahead.'
" ' The philosophy of life,' he said, 'embraces
three propositions: One, never ask a man to
drink; two, never refuse a drink when you
are asked; three, never mind what happens as
long as it doesn't happen to you. Those are
principles, gentlemen, that when viewed in
their broader significance, constitute the
philosophy of life.'
"And as the young man walked quietly
away he left a Bilent, thoughtful group behind
him." â¢__^___â _â

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
AN APPEAL TO TRUE POPULISTS.
The St. Lours Sell out Repudiated and
Earnest Action called For.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir: A ma
jority of the delegates to the People's party
National Convention, held at St. Louis July
23, under the leadership of Thomas V. Cator
and others, have sold out the Populists to the
Democratic party. Now it is the duty of every
Populist to prevent the delivery of the goods
next November.
To do this we must act at once. We have
fourteen delegates wbo stood true to their
principles. We must rally around them and
hold our organization or the "People's" party
is an dead as the monopolists could wish.
Our National Convention has given us a
Presidential candidate that refused the nomi
tion, one who is the nominee of the Democratic
party, one who says he does not believe in all
of our principles, without stating which ones
he does indorse, and who has so little respect
for t.ie would'be Arnolds and so much con
tempt for us poor betrayed dupes that he does
not consider it worth his time to even recog
nize the honor (?) bestowed.
Fellow-Populists, are you going to submit to
th is disgrace? I for one answer no.
I call on every Populist who has the man
hood to stand square for principle to send his
name to one of our delegates who has stood
true, and to hurl the gage of truceless resist
ance in the faces of the returning traitors to
Populistic principle.
Wo must not allow them to break up our
State and National organization. Instant
action can save them. To hesitate is to lose
all. A. J. Gaylord.
Corning, Cal., July 28, 1896.
Late delegate to state Convention, held at

Alas! How Changed!

Well, it is odd, but we do miss that dear old
foe, the Democratic party. Through all these
years of toil and struggle it was ever before us,
ready to give and take hard blows. We never
knew how much we loved it. No doubt it still
claims to be in the fray and to cry, "Lay on."
But we cannot feel so. The party which nomi
nated Bryan at Chicago did not come away
with the old front. It went in the same dear
old foe, but it came out transformed, changed,
etherealized. disguised. We haven't seen a
familiar feature since. We say it in sorrow.
We feel a sense of loss.

its adoption of a gold standard, Utah issues an
official circular calling for proposals for State
of Utah gold 4 per cent twenty-year funding
bonds, payable in United States gold coin. It
would be interesting to know just what Utah
meant by this. Did she forget the position she
had assumed before the whole country on the
gold question, or was Rhe just looking for a
chance to greenback Wall street by saying: |

A BELTED BASQUE.
The belted blouse or waist with a basque is
one of the latest developments of the reason
and is very stylish. It is made of various
materials, either to match the skirt or of con
trasting goods. Separate waists of silk are
very stylish. One of aull Â«age green, with
black satin line!!, had a collar of black silk
muslin, edged with a two-incU knife-pleating
of the muslin.
A waist of plain house serge was worn with
a skirt of cheviot, in which brown, blue and
white blended to mike a medium- toned
iabric. A narrow gilt belt was worn with this,
and the collar was made separate, to be worn
when a little more dressy effect was desired.
It was of embroidered batiste, with a narrow
edge of the same put on with just enough full
ness to make it set well, not in ruffle effect.
For wasnable fabrics this model Is delight
ful, when the gowns are really designed with
a view to washing, for it launders well. A
plain skirt and such a waist of brown hollandi
is a boon to any woman, being stylish and rea
sonable and suitable to wear on many occa
sions. A gilt belt of an inch or an inch and a
half wide is the proper width. Narrow white
leather belts look well with such a costume.
The heavy cotton and the thinner ones as
well develop nicely afier this model.
The lining is fitted with darts and under
arm gore and a seam in the center back. The
goods being seamless ttack and trout is gatb
ered at the waist line, and in the front at the
neck also. The basque is cut circular.
This pattern is a most simple one, as it may
be used without the basque, thus making two
distinct waists. For wash dresses the lining
may be omitted if desired.

1291, the men of Uri. Schwyz and ' Lower Un

protected territories were acquired, but no ad
ditions were made to the number of canton*
forming the league until 1795. In that year,
under the ? influence of France, the Helvetic
Republic was formed, with a regular constitu
tion. This failed to satisfy the cantons and in
1803 Napoleon; in the act of mediation, gave a
new constitution and increased the number of
cantons to nineteen. In 1815 perpetual neu

her territory were ; guaranteed by Austria,

THE FEARLESS AT SAUSALITO.
She Will Be Thoroughly Overhauled
and Painted and Again Put in
Commission.
The big tug Fearless will be put in com
mission again next week. For over a
month she has been laid up in order to
get a thorough overhauling. Yesterday
Captain Dan Haskell took her over to
Sausalito, and she is now anchored near
the clubhouse, close to the well-known
yacht Lurline. The move has been
made in order to get the tug away from
the coal dust and dirt of the water front.
She will be painted white, and when com
pleted will look like an addition to the
"White Squadron." The big tug and the
Lurline made a pretty picture as they lay
at anchor in Ricnardsons Bay yesterday.

came up on the steamer h on a mission to
Guatemala on behalf of his Government.
Ttie Belgic brings the nev s of the loss
of the British ship Scottish Dales. She
was bound fiom Tacoma for Australia,
and went on a coral reef in the Fiji Islands.
At the time the Dales was 216 miles east
by south from Suva," the capital of Fiji,
and under a full spread of canvas. Cap
tain McCarthy stood close into Vatoa reef
to catch the trade winds, and went on a
rock which was not down on the chart.
The vessel was loaded with lumber, aud a
heavy deckload weighted her down. She
soon began to settle and when the pumps
showed eleven feet of water in the hold
the crew abandoned her. Captain Mc-
Carthy and twenty men reached Suva, but
the gunboat Rugarooma had to be sent
out to loole for the mate's boat with eight
men in it. They were picked up two
days later and lauded at Suva. The only
man who suffered was a consumptive ap
prentice who was lying; at death's door
from the exposure when the mail left Fiji.
Owing to an inadvertence the name of
Purser Benclall was placed under the pic

take had been made.
Patrick Mackey, once a sailor boarding
house master, attempted to commit sui
cide in the Harbor Police station yester
day morning. He had been arrested for
drunkenness the night previously, and
when he sobered up took off his suspend
ers and hanged himself to one of the bars
of bis cell. Officer Cullom cut him down
and sent him to the Receiving Hospital.
The British ship Linlitbgow loaded with
wheat for England, was prevented from
leaving port at the last moment yester
day. The scow Colonel Baker took her a
load of coal, and as there was no steam
on the tramp's donkey engine, Captain
Petrie asked the captain of the scow to
hoist the coal aboard. This was done,
and then Captain Schouw demanded $20
pay. It was refused, and just as the
steamer was about to sail, the United
States Marshal put in an appearance and
libeled her for $20. The anchor had to be
dropped again and the vessel will lose nt
least $500 by the delay.
The schooner Lizzie Adami had a pecul
iar eijierience yesterday. She was on
her way from Alvarado with a load of jalt
for the steamer State of California. On
the way over she sprung a leak, but man
aged to reach her destination. All of the
salt that bad not melted was removed and
then the schooner was run on the mud
flats. The captain thinks that the Adams
ran on a snag while making her way
down the creek.
The three -whaling crews that will go
ont on the tug Fearless on the 22d inst.

will be seen from Clay -street wharf.
Amone the arrivals on the steamer Bel
nic yesterday was Milton Scott, an erst
while hunter on the sealing schooner
L visa D. He had an exciting time of it
in Japanese waters and very nearly lost
his life. Japanese footpads attacked him
and he shot two of them in self-defense.
He was tried for murder, but was acquitted
by the Consular Court and at once took
passage for San Francisco.
"I had a narrow escape," said Scott yes
terday. "The schooner had finished her
cruise in Japanese waters with a small
catch of 531 skins. We were all well and
hearty when we reached Hakodate, and
everybody got shore leave while the vessel
was fitting out again for a cruise in Bering
Sea. I was out one night and when re
turning to the ship three Japanese stood
me up. I showed tight and guarded my
self from their slashes with my right arm.
(Here Scott bared his arm and showed the
three cicatrices which are on his arm be
tween the wrist and elbow). W;ien I
saw it was a question of life or death I
drew my revolver and mortally wounded
one of my assailants and half-killed an
other. I was taken to Yokohama after
being held for murder in Hakodate and
was there tried before the United States
Consular Court. I was acquitted and the
Consul paid my way to San Francisco.

coast made good catches this season."
The ship Spartan arrived from Puget
Sound yesterday minus her first officer.
The men went ashore at Tacoma and
many of them got drunk. Mate Hansen
went ashore to round them up, when the
vessel was ready to sail, and had trouble.
One of the men showed fight and the
officer struck him on the mouth, knocking
him down. Hansen cut his hand badly
on the sailor's teeth and twenty-four
hours later blood-poisoning set in. Two
of his ringers were amputated. When the
Spartan sailed the hand was still inflamed
and the chances were that the arm would
have to be amputated at the elbow.
The steamer Mexico will make an ex
cursion to the wreck of the Colombia at

Alameda pigeon-fancier, will take out a
number of his carriers and some of them
will be released off the Farallones while
others will bring news direct from the
wreck. The Mexico will leave Broadway

CANNIBALS THAT EAT CHINESE
Over Ten Thousand Wild Men That
Are Death to Some, bnt Friendly
to the Japs.
In the recently acquired island of For
mosa Japan has added a territory to her
possessions eaual probably to one-quarter
of the area of the former empire and the
new possession is to be devoted particu
larly to the production of tea for the for
eign trade.
H. Fujiyama of Tokio, civil professor in
the Imperial Military Academy for com
missioned officers, recently visited For
mosa and went among the aboriginal
Malay savages that inhabit the eastern
and comparatively unknown part of the
island.
Mr. Fujiyama arrived here yesterday on
the Belgic in company with J. Suzuki, a
merchant of Tokio. He has a year's leave of
absence and is making a pleasure tour of
the world. During the recent war he
served as a civil officer on the staff of Mar
shal Oyama, commander-in-chief of the
second army of Japan, in the invasion of
Korea.
"Japan's military academy," he said
when seen yesterday at the Occidental,
"was established fourteen years ago upon
the German plan. At first we had German
officers as teachers, but now only Japanese
military officers and civil professors â forty
in all. It is a higher institution ror lien
tenants and captains. Until the late war
a class of twenty entered each year for a
three years' course, but since that time the
class has been increased to fifty, so that
there are always about 150 officer-students
in the academy.
"This increase is in conforrnance with
Japan's plan for the increase of her stand
ing army. Th<j army is to be practically
doubled in size in the coarse of the next
five or six years.
"Japan's stand ng army to-day consists
of about 105,000 men, and is divided into
seven divisions. It will be increased to
thirteen divi <ions. A division at present
includes about 15,000 men, and is made up
of two brigades of infantry, a regiment of
artillery and a corps of engineers.
"To this will be added a regiment of
cavalry and a battery en train, and in
time of war a pontoon column, a sanitary
attachment and a horse reserve for each
division. The Government is going to in
troduce better horses in the military ser
vice. Our horses are small and unsuited
to heavy artillery. European horses will
be imported.
"I visited the island of Formosa a little
while ago. Everything is peaceful there
now. A great many Japanese are going
there for business and to settle. Very
few Japanese women have gone yet. For
mosa is one-fourth the size of all Japan.
Geographically it is divided into two
parts â eastern and western â a mountain
range forming the division' line. In the
west there is a population of 3,000,000
Chinese.
"In the east there are somewhere about
10,000 Malays â savages, cannibals. The
population is only estimated, for nothing
is known of the interior. There may be
very many more. The Malays were the
original inhabitants. The Chinese came
as intruders. Consequently there is a very
bitter feeling against the Chinese, and the
Malays cut their heads off whenever they
have an opportunity.
"They are a wild, savage, warlike, ener
getic people and practice cannibalism,
their special delight being Chinese. To
ward the Japanese they are very friendly.
We are treating them as we would ladies,
very courteously and diplomatically.
"When I went there, with an armed es
cort of course, they hailed us as brothers
and begged of us to drive the Chinese off
the island. They subsist on sweet i>ota
toes and the flesh of wild animals, par
ticularly deer, which are very plentiful.
"They hunt with the bow and arrows
and the spear and many of them hare
rifles obtained from the Chinese in barter.
A long time ago the Dutch tried to settle
on Formosa, but the natives drove them
away. These savages live in little settle
ments composed of rude huts and each
seems to have its chief or president.
"Camphor is the chief product of the
eastern part of the island. A few English
and German companies handle the busi
ness, but all their operations are protected
by guards. The western part, where the
Chinese are, is very fertile.
"Agriculturally Formosa is divided into
three zones â the northern or tea country,
the central or rice and orange country,
and the southern or rugar-cane country.
"We care little for the rice country, as
we raise plenty of thyt at home. But we
shall develop the tea industry, with the
prospect of a great foreign trade. We
shall not disturb the Chinese, but perhaps
as the Japanese come in they will grad
ually leav6. Well, perhaps the 10,000 can
nibal Malays may consume the 3,000,000
Clinese. I wish they would. I would
like to see the Chinese away from there.
They are a dirty people.
"At present we have three mixed bri
gades of Japanese troops, about 30,000
men in Formosa, and 3000 gendarmes, or
armed police, besides 10,000 officers and
civil service men.
"The Government is building a system
of railroads and wagon-roads in Formosa.
The Chinese had a few, but they were
badly built. A line is being built from
Is eel tin, the principal seaport, to Taipei,
the capital and biggest city, thence to
Shinchiku, about forty miles.
"Our Government has divided the
island into three territorial districts,
a northern, a central and southern, each
of which is a state with its separate corps
of officials."
Mr. Fujiyama Jauehingly says that he
does not know whether his ancestors were
named after Japan's great volcanic moun
tain or whether the mountain was named
after them.
He wenrs upon the lapel of his coat a
little button similar to that of the Loyal
Legion in America. It has a scarlet rim,
and upon its indented face are six scarlet
spokes upon a field of white. The button
signifies that the wearer has been decor
ated by the Emperor with the "Order of
the Rising Sun." Mr. Fujiyama will spend
a month in the United States.

CHECKS ON THE
VALLEY ROAD
It May Be Compelled to
Stop Construction at
Fresno.
BLOCKED BT RESIDENTS.
They Demand Damages, but Re
fuse to State the Amounts
of Their Claims.
CHEAPER FARES IN PROSPECT.
Passengers Will Be Carried on the
N:w Road in About Six
Weeks.
Unless there is a radical change at Fres
no, all construction work on the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad
will be suspended in about two weeks,
and between 300 and 400 men will be
thrown out of employment. But the ef
fect on the employes of the road will be
but trifling in comparison to that on the
broader and more important interests of
the producers of the upper valley, south
of Fresno, who will be deprived of the
competition of the Valley road and the
lower rates that have thus far followed
closely on the progress of the people's
line.
For many weeks now negotiations have
been in progress with the owners of prop
erty bordering the right of way of the
Valley road through Fresno, along Q
street, for the settlement of their claims
for damages alleged to have resulted from
the proximity of the tracks of the new
railroad. But despite the fact that they
have been asked to formulate and present
their claims, they have refused to do so,
for reasons that are not apparent.
Until the road is in actual operation no
actual damage can result and the pro
jectors of the enterprise so much desired
and prayed for by the people of the San
Joaquin Valley do not propose to become
involved in unnecessary and expensive
litigation. They state that they stand
ready to do all tbat is fair and to push the
construction with the utmost rapidity
consistent with economy and justice to
the stockholders.
The grading of the road is now virtually
completed to within half a mile of the
northern end of the town of Fresno and
tracklaying is now going on with all
dispatch to that point. This work will all
be completed in about two weeks and
then further construction will come to a
halt until there is an un trammeled and
unobstructed pathway.
Not only is the advance of the' railroad
blocked by this stand of the Fresnoites,
but the prosperous growth of the town
itself is checked. It is the intention of
the Valley road to put i.i a turntable
there, to erect a fine, large and costly
depot, and to establish repair-shops, and
for every day that the town is deprived of
these improvements, there is a loss to it
of al! the business arid stimulation to en
terprise tbat would follow their advent.
Meanwhile tbat portion of tr.e road al
ready constructed will be put into tbe
best possible shape for operation, but not
another foot will be graded until there is
an absolutely clear path ahead.
From present indications passenger busi
ness will begin about the middle of Sep
tember. By that time the passenger
coach c** of the road will be here, and ail
the locomotives will be setup and ready
for use. While the passenger tariffs have
already been prepared, they will not oe
made public until actually put into force.
It is known, however, that the fares will
be on the whole lower than those now pre
vailing on the Southern Pacific lines,

from Stockton than those of the rival lines
the combination of the 25-cent fare now
charged by boat from here to Stockton
with the rate of the Valley road out from
Stockton will tjive a big reduction on tho
Southern Pacific charges. i<rom here to
Fresno the Southern Pacific fare is $5 90.
From Stockton to Fresno the fare is $3 75.
To the latier the 25-cent rate of the boats
can be added and thus a $4 fare is made
through to Fresno. This combination
cannot now be made, as the Southern Pa
cific is very careful not to have any of its
trains make connection witn the boats at
Stockton. Just the opDosite will be the
policy of the Valley road.
Plans are now being projected in this
city for a 20-knot steamer to be used in
the passenger business between here and
Stockton by the California Navigation ami
Improvement Company. When she is
placed in service tne time to Stockton by
water will be no greater than it is now by
rail. The run up to Stockton will ba
made in about four and a half hours and
to this city in four hours.
In about two weeks work will be com
menced on a $4000 combination freight
and passenger depot at Merced by the
Valley road. It will be located on Twenty
fourth street, between M and N. It will
be 160 long and 45 feet wide, including the
freight platform. The passenger end of
the structure will be temporary. It will
eventually be made a part of the freight
depot and a handsome brick structure
erected for the passengers' accommoda
tion on the same block. Bids for the com
bination depot will be asked for early
next week.

SEWERS WHICH
ARE CESSPOOLS
Property - Owners Talking
of a Public Up
rising.
CONTAGION SPREADING
Two Deaths Have Already Been
Caused by the Foul
Gases.
CAJf GAIN NO RELIEF.
Petitions to the Superintendent of
Streets Receive No At
tention.
The biggest kind of a row is brewing
among the residents and property-owners
ill the vicinity of California street, at the
intersection of Walnut. The indignation
of the people is directed at Superintendent
ot Streets Ashworth for what they claim
to be an almost criminal neglect of their
interests.
Certainly, an investigation of the cause
of this complaint, as was done yesterday
by The Call, makes it appear good and
sufficient for a considerable amount of
kicking. The ways of the Street Depart
ment for several years have been past
finding out.
This cause of the Walnut and California
streets kick is a case in point They have
two sewers out there that have no outlet.
Quite a number of communities in the
City are favored with one such sewer â
tiianks to a reckless, irresponsible policy
in the Street Department â but no other is
so distinguished as to have two of that
kind.
Walnut street drains south to California
and California drains east to Walnut. A
sewer is laid in California street, west of
Walnut, but it stops at the Walnut-street
line. Continued on one block from there
to Central avenue it would make connec
tion with the general sewer system there.
But it Â«loes not. It'is left to fill up with
the drainage from the stretch of hill west
ward.
Over a year ago a sewer was laid in Wal
nut street to the line of California. Wal
nut street is thickly settled, costly resi
dences lining both sides of it. The drain
age from these houses runs into this sewer
and lies there â no outlet being afforded.
Th* effect has been such as to empty
many of the houses of the tenants and to
bring sickness and death to the tenants
who have been unable to get away.
The residents and property-owners have
besieged the Superintendent of Streets,
but they get no satisfaction. The Board
of Health being notified visited the place
and immediately condemned the wort,
but nothing has been done.
In April last the people in the vicinity
were made to rejoice by the appearance of
a gang of men who got to work digging
and afterward building an extension to
the sewer. They thought, of course, that
relief had come. Some forty-six feet were
added to the end of the sewer, carrying it
from the north line to the center of Cali
fornia street. And then, to the amaze
ment of everybody, the workmen stopped,
filled up the hole and went away.
The people were to be taxed for having
their distress aggravated, for the longer
the blind sewer extended the more filth it
would hold and the more contagion it
would spread. .Remonstrance was re
doubled, but it ended with remonstrance.
It is true a man from the Street Depart
ment was ordered one day to go out and
look at the loose sand above the blind end
which it was declared was full of foul
seepage.
tie struck his pick into it and the escap
ing gas blew the seepage into the air.
Some ?and bags were piled over the top in
the hopes ot suppressing it, the man went
away and that is the last that has been
done in the way of relief.
In the meantime Mr. and Mrs. Hickby,
living in the house on the corner of Cali
fornia and Walnut streets, have lost two
children by death. A sister-in-law of Mrs.
Hickby is now lying seriously ill, and the
physician warns her that she cannot get
well so long aa she stays in the infected
neighborhood.
The family of E. Wilfcins is also suffer
ing ill health directly chargeable by the
physicians to the poison in the air.
R. C. Miller, who owns some cottages in
the neighborhood which he is unable to
find tenants for from the same cause, J.
W. Burling and Charles B. Holbrook, all
interested in property in the neighbor
hood, have been saying and doing all they
can to gain relief.
"One trouble is that the Supervisors ac
cept such straw bonflsmen for contractors
that they can break their contracts with
impunity," said R. U. Miller yesterday.
"Two different parties have taken con
tracts for this work, and both have
failed to do the worn. The trouble seems
to be that the block between Walnut
street and Central avenue, that makes the
breach between the sewers, is covered
with the tracks of the Market-Btreet Rail
way Company. The steam road from the
Cliff House comes in there, and fhere is
the turntable of the California-street line.
"My notion ia that there is the real
trouble. Some influence is exerted to call
off the contractors. Some of these days,
however, you will see the biggest accident
on that line that we have witnessed in San
Francisco for a long time. The tracks are
sinking and cannot be maintained over
that wet earth. The rails will spread and
go down under one of those heavy trains
some day, and â well, after that, this out
rage will be remedied perhaps."
George W. Elder, expert to the Board of
Supervisors, was seen last night about this
matter. He said: "I have done every
thing I possibly can for these people, but
I cannot force the Street Department to do
this work. I have reported the matter to
the Superintendent and to the Board of
Health and to the Supervisors. It is a
crying shame, there is no doubt about
that. If this work had been done properly
two lives might have been saved and much
loss to the property-owners. The property
owners are willing to pay all proper assess
ments and why it is noi done I don't un
derstand.
"The building of the sewer in that
si. ape was a great blunder in the first
place. No sewer should ever be begun
that did not continue to an outlet. The
idea of building a sewer half way down the
â ide of a hill and there stopping, within a
few yards of an outlet, thus becoming a
mere well or cesspool in the middle of a
street! No other city would tolerate it.
To stand over one of the manholes of that
Walnut-street sewer is as much as a
man's life is worth."

Mrs. Sarah E. Wise, M.D., Mrs. A. Kel
ley, Mrs. H. J. Benson, Dr. T. B. Janes.
Tne board of management is composed of
the officer?, together with Mrs. H. I. Ben
son and Mrs. W. H. L. Davis and George
S. Montgomery.
This is an outgrow"th of the Newsboys'
Home, started some time ago. It aims to
give the boys a home that is so, not only
in name but in fact, where they will have
not only food and shelter and the care
which boys with h-mes receive from
their parents and relatives; a place win-re
they will have friends to interest them
selves in obtaining work for them ; when
they are able to do it, and to which they
can return when in distress or trouble of
any kind.
A special branch of the work is the
training department, where the boys may
be taught useful occupations. A photo
graphic department is in good running
order and on a paying basis at the present
time, and the boy managers turn out
some very creditable work. Besides this
the lads are doing a considerable amount
of developing and printing for outside
parti3s. The printing office is almost
ready to open up, thanks to several dona
tions of type and material during the
past week. A further enterprise is the
mattress repairing and upholstering de
partment, which will be ready for busi
ness in a few days.
A number of boys are in the building at
the present time, and several have already
gone to good places secured through the
good offices of friends of the home.
Arrangements have been completed for
the publication of a monthly paper de
voted to the interests of the boys and girls
of California, the proceeds of which will
go toward the support of the home, and
it is lioped that it will not be long before
the entire work on the "Pacific Youth"
will be done in the home by the boys.
No one connected with the institution
receives any salary or compensation. It
has a very efficient lady in charge in the
person of Mrs. Jackson. Tne mechanical
department is in charge of Mr. Hutchin
son, who has had experience in the News
boys' Home in Los Angeles' and other
similar institutions elsewhere.
The photographic department is under
the care of Master Philip Carman who
has demonstrated his ability in the past
few weeks.
Every Thursday night a newsboys' club
meets at the home, where they are enter
tained and refreshments are served. It is
proposed to organize a similar club for
messenger-boys in the near future.
Though the work of getting the institu
tion on its feet has been done in a very
quiet manner, it has already become pretty
well known, and numerous donations of
cash and material for the various depart
ments have been received, which have
enabled the managers to do more than
could have been expected with the little
publicity given their plans.

giving him even one brief fraction of an
instant in which to raise a cry of unavail
ing protest against the potent force which
struck him down.
For some tims past Maurice Hultzmer, a
boy of 15 years, has been in the employ ef
a ladies' tailor named Speier, who has
offices in room 77 on the fourth floor of the
Donahue building. Of frail and sickly
constitution, he had not been working for
a few days, but yesterday, feeline some
what better, he returned to his tasks. He
was a buttonhole-maker, and. ran a ma
chine in one corner of the shop. Nearby
are two sewing-machines, all three being
run by electricity.
At lunchtime yesterday Maurice went to
his home at 1048 Howard street to take
his midday meal with his family. His
aged father keeps a second-hand shop at
the number mentioned, the next house
being occupied by a married sister, whose
husband keeps a shoestore. There are
two smaller brothers, the elder of whom is
barely old enough to go to school.
During lunch Maurice seemed to be gay
and full of fun. His sister's husband and
he jested throughout the meal, ana when
the lad hastened back to work a bright,
boyish smile was playing over his open
face.
When next the little home circle gazed
on that unwrinkled countenance it was
set ana rijrid in the pale coldness of death.
On returning to the shop Maurice re
sumed his work, chatting meanwhile with
two of the sewing girls â Flora Gursky of
229 Hayes street and Minna Monesck of
1055 Folsom street. About 3 o'clock the
lad had occasion to use a pair of steel
shears. As he laid them down on the
machine the points touched the exppsed
coupling of the electric wire and the boy
sank back in his chair a corpse..
Not a scream nor a struggle accompa
niea the advent of the dread destroyer.
Silently and suddenly, like a lamp blown
out by the wind, the young life came to
its end.
When the surviving employes realized
what had occurred the shop became a
scene of wildest confusion. The girls be
came hysterical, and for a time it seemed
impossible to restrain their shrieks. By a
strange lack of thought the boys mother
was notified of the sad affair ana came to
the place in a state of frenzied grief. Her
wails of anguished bereavement resounded
through the corridors for nearly an hour,
and when the Coroner's officers arrived to
remove the body her transports of bitter
agony were heartrending. She clung to
the slender formâ so white and fair, save
for a slight discoloration of the hand
which had held the shears â and refused to
let it go until firm bnt kindly hands
parted her from what regained of her
nrÃtborn son.
Back to the once happy home, now
submerged in desolation, went the mother
with her tale of grief. The frightened
girls departed for the day, as did the
equally nervous proprietor, locking the
door behind him. Much blame would
seem to lie at the door of the person or
persons charged with the inspection and
care of the electric-power apparatus. The
wire which led to the machines was un
covered for nearly an inch at the coupling
near the buttonhole machine, having
been for an indefinite period a standing
menace to the lives of all who ap
proached it.
Meanwhile the youthful victim, forever
freed from every earthly danger, lies at
rest, one of the silent, everchsnging
throng borne in and out of the Ciiy
Morgue.
THE TAAFFE DIVORCE.
The Mother Awarded the Custody of
Her Little Boy.
Judge Hebbard's decree in the divorce
case of Mary J. Taaffe versus William F.

Clerk's office. By the provisions set forth
in the decree Mrs. Taarfe is granted a di
vorce because of her husband's desertion.
She is awardsd the custody of Randal,
her minor son, and property in Santa
Clara County worth about $35,000 is de
clared to belong to her personally and not
to be considered as community property.
The Taaffes' home was on a large fruit
ranch down near Alountain View, in Santa
Clara County. The domestic relations, it
is stated, had not been harmonicas for a
period of a year or more.
PAUL NEUMANN IS ILL.
fix-Queen Liliuokalani's Adviser Comes
Here for Treatment.
Paul Neumann, the Honolulu attorney,
who is legal adviser to ex-Queen Liliuo
kalani and who was Attorney-General dur
ing the Jast years of her reign, has come to
this City for medical care at the request of
1 his twin brother, Edward Neumann, the
well-known local chemist and police court
interpreter.
Mr. Neumann is a sick man. All day
yesterday and last night he was confined
to his rooms at the Palace, where his
brother remained carefully watching by
his side. Dr. Lovelace was called soon after
the arrival of the patient. The Honolulu
physicians pronounced Mr. Neumann's
ailment to be diabetes. How long he will
remain here or where he will go next is
not known even to his brother, for he has
not conversed about his plans or about
Hawaiian affairs since he arrived.

P. J. Hannessy, arrested two days ago for pass
ing a counterfeit silver dollar on a tomale
vendor, was held by Commissioner Heacock
yesterday for trial in the United States Dis
trict Court. Hennessy is an old offender
against the law. He was convicted October
31, 1884, in the United States District Court
on a leiony charge of false registration and
sent to San Quentin for three years. In 1892
he was charged and convicted in the Superior
Court ot ussault and given five years in the
same prison.
PRECITA VALLEY'S WANTS
The Residents There Insist Upon
Various Needed Improve
ments.
Extending the Car Lineâ Police Pro
tection and Eetler Streets
Demanded.
The residents of Precita Valley are
wide awake and active, and intend that
the neighborhood in which they live shall,
as soon as possible, have the benefit of all
modern improvements. Electric lights,
police protection, better streetcar service,
improved streets, sidewalks and sewers
are some of the things urgently needed.
At the meeting last night of the Precita
Valley Improvement" Club in Graham
Hall, President S. A. Byrne in the chair,
the railroad committee reported that the
prospect was favorable for soon securing
an extension of the electric line from its
present terminus at Folsom and Twenty
sixth streets to Precita avenue.
Steps are also being taken to get the
City to make an appropriation for the im
provement of Bernal Park, which, by the
expenditure of a comparatively small sum
ot money, could be made one of the most
attractive and popular features of the
valley.
A letter was read by the secretary an r
nouncing the incorporation of the Precita
Valley organization in the Ban Francisco
Association of Improvement clubs.
It was stated that the unsanitary condi
tion of the sewers in the neighborhood
would be shortly attended to by the Board
of Health. The sewer at Bryant and
Twenty-sixth streets was ludicrously de
scribed as being on stilts and a nuisance
to the public health. Sidewalks are
needed irom Twenty-sixth street to Ala
bama for the benefit, especially, of the
hundreds of school children by whom the
street is traversed daily. The matter will
be brought to the attention of Superinten
dent of Streets Ashworth.
Daniel Sullivan, Henry Behrens and
Joseph Vizzard were appointed a commit
tee on park and street improvements and
Messrs. Vizzard, McCarthy and Behrens
were selected to make a canvass of the dis
trict and thus increase the numerical and
and moral strength of the club.

RENTS PAID IN
ENGLISH POUNDS
Leases That Call for Pay
ment in Sterling
Money.
ALSO IN GOLD BULLION.
John T. Doyle Makes Certain oi
His Client's Rental
Income.
HOW MRS. DONAHUE IS PAID.
For San Francisco Pioperty She Gets
Ounces of Gold or British
Sovereigns.
John T. Doyle, the prominent lawyer,
declares with evident pride that the man
who laughs last laughs best. Of course,
he says so in other words, but he nods his
head, looks wise and remarks with a
knowing air: "I knew what I was doing
when I insisted on having my client's
leases contain a provision that rent be
paid in gold bullion or pounds sterling
money of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland.
"You may think it strange, but don't
you think I knew what I was doing? I
saw this thing coming, this disturbance
of finance. Four years ago 1 could see ap
proaching some serious change in the
value of United States money. Now, is it
not here? Have we not reached that
point where we are menaced by a change?
That is why I took time by the forelock
and looked ahead. That is why I de
manded payment of large sums in gold
bullion.
"Ounces of gold. They are my favorites.
\Vhen a man could not tell what was go
ing to happen with regard to money, only
you felt that a crisis was not impossible,
ounces of gold, standard fineness, would be
absolutely saie."
Mr. Doyle is attorney for Mrs. Annie
Donahue, who has large real estate inter
ests in San Francisco. Mr 3. Donahue
lives here and is not given to sojourning
in Great Britain and Ireland. In fact this
City is her home and here her money re
mains. Leases in which she sppeara as
lessor make provision for payment in
pounds sterling instead of in the custom
ary "gold coin of the United. States," as
specified in the State laws, have recently
been recorded at the City Hall. Naturally
they gave rise to considerable comment
among real estate agents and financiers,
but those men will retain their opinions
on the necessity of such an expedient.
The following is a copy of the clause in
those leases demanding English money in
payment of rent of San Francisco property :
But the monthly rent or sum of four hun
dred (SHOO) dollars, payable only as herein
specified, in equal installments on the eighth
day of each and every month of said term,
said monthly payments to be made in gold
coin of the United States of the mint standard
of A.D. 1861, provided, however, if at any
time during the term hereby created, the lessee
or its assigns shall propose or offer to pay said
monthly rent or any part thereof in any other
currency than that above specified, the lessor,
her heirs or assigns shall have, the right by an
Instrument under her hand to declare the
terms of this lease changed, and they shall
thereupon be changed so that the Haidmontnlv
rent shall thenceforth become and be the
sum of eighty (Â£80) pounds sterling, money of
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland.
The lease in which this appears is a re
newal of a lease with the Union Stock
yards Company for property on Townsend
street. It is now on record at the City
TJ" - 1 1 *
leases have been made with
other tenants of Mrs. Donahue, with the
exception that instead of dollars they call
for cold bullion, 900 fine and in ounces
and fractions of ounces. A lease for a por
tion of the Columbia building is made on
this plan with the option of substituting
British sovereigns if the lessee and lessor
wish to make a change in the money.
Mr. Doyle gave his explanation for the
peculiar form of agreement yesterday:
"Four years ago," said be, "I made a
lease in one instance calling for payment
in gold bullion, 900 fine, and specifying
the weight. Oi course, payment could be
made in United States $20 gold pieces, for
the specifications were equivalent to so
many $20 pieces. Anyhow, I could send
the bullion to the mint and have it turned
into gold coin.
'One tenant said to me, 'I don't under
stand this gold bullion proposition.'
"He refused to take up the lease on the
terms proposed for payment. I said, 'You
understand pounds sterling, then? 1 "
"He said he did. 8o 1 replied: 'We'll
make it pounds sterling, or their equiva
" 'Very well,' says he, and we made the
lease out that way.
"Everybody Knows what an English
sovereign is. It is not liable to fluctuate
in valueâ it is a standard of gold, if you
will, and there can't be any quibbling over
it when it comes to determine the dif
ference in values of currency. It is veiy
easy to give the equivalent of English sov
ereigns, so a bill of exchange would not be
necessary. ' '
PROCESSION VANDALS.
Stable and Livery Men Sustain
Damages by Malicious
Persons.
Political Parades Offer the Most
Attractive Opportunities for
the Rowdies.
Complaints have been received from
livery men that during parades, etc.,
street rowdies have been mutilating car
riages and harness and maiming horses.
It has become so bad that it is with re
luctance that some stablemen allow their
horses to be taken in a parade at all.
After every one of the recent turnouts it
has been found that some valuable horse
has been injured by being out with a knife,
or some carriage has been damaged by
having the varnish scraped off in big
patches or the wood mutilated.
At the last Fourth of July procession it
was noticed that a horse ridden by one of
the aids to the grand marshal had been
injured in a similar manner, and at the
bicycle turnout last week a similar injury
is said to have been inflicted upon a horse
ridden by one of the paraders.
J. W. Gregory, superintendent of the St.
George's stable, on Bush street, just above
Kearny, has had harness cut on several
occasions, besides carriages and other
vehicles mutilated to greater or less degree.
This line of injury to property is more
prevalent when the parade is held under
the auspices of any one of the political
parties.
The greatest sufferer from the fiends'
acts is probably W. Michelson of 617 Ellis
street, who has had several glass doors on
his carriages broken, as if a cane had been
jabbed through the pane, and when he
hired out a $J4OO carnage for the first
time to carry some politicians at a politi
cal ratification the panels of that new car
riage were scored along one side as if it
had been held against a buzzsaw.
So annoying is this petty injury to
stablemen that they are not over-anxious
to hire out valuable horses or carriages at
street parades, particularly wbeu the pro
cession smacks of politics.
FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.
Woman Saffragiits Are Preparing for a
Vigorous and Well-Organized
Campaign.
Interest in woman suffrage among the
colored people of the City is becoming
very mariced. Mrs. Anderson's lectures
drawing immense crowds. Last night at
her address in the colored Baptist church
on Powell street the auditorium was
thronged, the aisles being filled with
men. Apparently the manifest sym
pathy of her audience had some effect
on the gifted lecturers' eloquence, for she
spoke as she has never spoken here before.
In the Thirty-fourth Assembly District
sixteen precinct clubs are being formed,
much interest being shown by all the ladies
living in the vicinity. Yesterday after
noon an enthusiastic rally took place at
1630 Folsom street, at which several hun
dred friends of the cause were present.
Mrs. Sargent, Mrs. Long, Miss Sargent
and other well-known Jady orators ad
dressed the assemblage on topics germain
to the movement. Similar activity is be
ing evinced in the other districts, and
every indication points to a spirited, well
organized campaign.
WON'T CLOSE WEBSTER
School Directors Table the Mat
ter on the Grand Jury's
Action.
No Provision Had Been Made to
Accommodate the Numerous
Pupils Elsewhere.
The Webster Primary School will not be
osed, at least at this time. The School
Directors met yesterday to consider a
proposition to close the school. When
the board came together a group of Jady
schoolteachers occupied seats in the room
and took a lively interest in the proceed
ings. The session was special, and was
brought about by a petition signed by
Charles A. Murdock, Charles H. Hawiey,
H. McElroy and H. C. Henderson. The
petition proposed to discontinue and abol
ish tbe Webster Primary School; also to
transfer Miss M. M. Murphy from the
principalship of the Jefferson Primary
School to the principalship of the Le Conte
Primary; to transfer Miss Agnes M. Man
ning from the principalship of the Web
ster Primary School co the principalsuip
of the Jefferson Primary School; and to
allow the principal of the Jefferson Pri
mary School to retain the fifth-grade
classes in that school without further
orders.
Only one part of this programme re
ceived any uttention, which was the por
tion relating to the closing of the Webster
Primary School. Just before the board
came together a communication referring
to the action proposed was received from
the Grand Jury. That body did not wish
to have the school discontinued. The pro
ceedings were opened by Director Mur
dock, who offered a resolution for closing
the Webster Primary, and the Director
spoke a little, saying that closing must
come some time, because there is a gen
eral agreement that this is necessary.
Now, however, he was inclined to con
sider the suggestion and recommendation
from tbe Grand Jury, and he would there
fore move that the matter be tabled.
Miss Manning became so interested dur
ing Director Aiurdock's remarks that she
began to speak. As Mr. Murdock moved
to table the resolution Miss Manning and
the other teachers of the group passed
suddenly from gloom to happiness.
Director Carew spoke briefly. Then
the motion made by Director Murdock
was adopted unanimously and the board
was declared adjourned.
The communication from the Grand
Jury, which was signed by Frauk Maskey
as foreman, is as follows:
The Grand Jury has learned that it is
the intention of your honorable body to
condemn as unfit and unsafe for further
school purposes tbe buildings now and
heretofore in use by the Webster Primary
School on Fifth street, near Market. The
condition of fcundry school buildings ana
adjacent premises has been called to the
atu iition of the Grand Jury since it has
been in session, and visits of inspection
have been made by jurors at various times
to the buildings and premises requiring
repairs, one of which was the Webster
Primary School.
The reports of visiting jurors in regard
to the said Webster Primary School build
ings are that they are m comparatively
good repair, and in safe condition for use
as heretofore for school purposes. We have
been informed that between 800 and 900
children are in attendance at the said
school, and that the pupils live within the
prescribed territorial limit assigned to that
school.
Further, that there has been no greater
percentage of sickness among said pupils
than in other schools, and that danger to
life and limb from fire in the adjacent
premises has been guarded against by pre
cautions taken to have several safe places
of exit from said school premises.
In view of the foregoing circumstances,
and also the fact that no provision has
been made in the appropriations asked

Crooked Township Lines Explained
"There is a reason for most everything,"
said a Cumberland County man, when he
was asked how in the world they came to
have such a crpoked line between two
towns in his county, "there's a reason for
this crooked line. You see, some of our
towns established, in pioneer times when
land was abundant and people were few.
had a big territory which was afterward
sliced off to make new towns. It was so in
the case you mention and when the cut-off
was made people along the line of division
were of different minds as to which town
they wanteil to be in. So the Legislature
drew a straight line between the two parts
and then provided that persons dwelling
on lands adjoiniiiÃ either side of this line
miicht be in one town or the other, as they
should decide within ninety days after
passing the act. Some went one way and
some the other and the line was all skewed
up to accommodate them."â Lewiston
Evening Journal.
The Tower of London is said to be the
oldest building in Europe.

A LETTER FKOM APIA.
Merchant Moors Asks That the
President and Press Be
Appealed To.
MR. BRANDEIS IS OPPOSED.
He Is of Marshall Island Fame and
Proposed for President at
Apia.
The latest advices from Samoa show
that American residents and merchants
fear in the proposed appointment by the
German Government of Commissioner
Brandeis of the Marshall Islands as presi
dent of the Municipal Council of the gov
ernment at Apia a serious menace to
American commercial interests, and par
ticularly the interests of San Francisco, in
the ijamoan Islands.
This information was received yesterday
in a letter to James R. Watson, a shipping
commissioner, from H. J. Moors, a leading
and wealthy merchant at Apia.
The letter says Brandeis was instru
mental in driving out of the Marshall
Islands near this group the business or the
late Andrew Crawford ol this Ciiy and all
other American commercial interests.
Brandeis is the German Government's
representative at the Marshall Islands
under the treaty between America, Ger
many and England as to their respective
powers in these islands, which was
brought about by the late James G.
Blame. â 
Mr. Moors says that the Germans now
practically run things at Samoa, and he
asks that President Cleveland and the
press of the United States be appealed to
nÂ«ot to sanction the appointment of Brau
deis.
The letter is as follows:
Apia, Samoa, July 17, 1896.
Dfor Mr. Watson: The steamer is in and
departs almost immediately. Excuse any
mistakes.
We have just learned that the German press
are urging their Government to appoint Bran
deis as president of the Municipal Council a-nd
ad riser to the Government here.
If this is don ; e the greater part of the work
of the Berlin Conference will be undone, and
the minute that this party sets foot here war
against the natives will be inevitable.
We are allâ that is, the British ana American
residentsâ verj much astounded to learn that
the German press would propose such an ap
pointment, and we ask you to present the
matter to the press of San Francisco in such a
way as to make such a noise as to deter Presi
dent Cleveland from accepting Braudeis as a j
representative of the powers.
W e are most anxious that the spirit of the
treaty will now be carried out and that the
new President will be neltaer an American, a
German nor an Englishman, but a subject ot
one of the powers referred to in the Berlin
.general act.
President Schmidt and his predecessor. Yon
Pilsach, have been notorious failures, because
they have been.men of scant ability and be
cause they have been sent here to look out for
German interests to the detriment of all
others.
The Municipal Council consists of three Ger
mans and two Englishmen, myself and the
president, who of course is a German. They
ahvays in all' matters vote solidly together, so
that the balance of us feel that it makes little
or no difference .whether we are present or not.
All measures are settled in the German con
sulate or in the German firm before the meet
'luga start, and we cannot alter them, being
always in the minority.
The United States has been driven out of the
Gilberts, the Marshalls, the Carolines and the
groups to the westward. Are we to be made so
uncomfortable here that we have also to get
out of Samoa? â¢
Strong editorial comment is what we wantâ
somerhing that will be copied throughout the
country. Do what you can.
Schmidt, our President and adviser, Is a man ]
without the least qualification for his office
and could not, if he tried, earn $10 per week
in any capacity. You have no doubt noted
how he pursued me in the courts here because
he knew that i had no protection as long as
Blscklock was in office. Brandeis is bolder
and would be worse yet. Make a noise for us.
11. J. Moors.
It wa3 lear ned yesterday that Mr. Peter
son of the firm of Peterson & Marcus,
will call the attention of the Chamber of
Commerce to the danger that is threaten
ing the commerce of the country and San
Francisco in the Samoan Islands, and
propose that some action be taken to pro
tect American interests there.
James R- Watson said he hoped some
action would be taken by Congressmen, or
others, to bring the matter formally to the
attention of the administration and see if
something cannot be done without loss of
time to stop the rapid ascendancy of Ger
man influence and government in Samoa.
Mr. Watson is familiar to a considerable
extent with the career of Brandeis in the
islands of the South bea. He said last
nignt:
"The situation in Samoa is really
serious. Peace is threatened. Mataafa is
tbe favorite chief of the natives who do
not favor German preponderance in the
islands. Mataafa is held a prisoner in the
JMarsnali Islands by the Germans to King
Malietoa, who has been put in his place,
the natives will not pay tribute, and
Malietoa is supported by the Germans.
The result of this is that the country is
rapidly becoming bankrupt. The natives
want Mataafa back."
Brandeis was previously a German
official in Samoa. He was instrumental
in promoting trouble among the natives
who were opposed to the Germans' ruling.
After this state of affairs had continued
seyeral years Brandeis was promoted to be
commissioner of the Marshall Islands.
Moon knows that if Brandeis is sent
back to Apia as president of the munici
pal council and the adviser there for his
Government that he will use his influence
to increase the German grip there. If
this man be appointed San Francisco will
suffer a great blow. He will drive out
American business interests just as they
were driven out of the Marshall Islands
by the Germans.
"The Jate Andrew Crawford of San
Francisco," Watson continued, "came to
this coast a sailmaker. He slowly got
iiito this island trade and built up a tine
business, with headqnarters in the Mar
shall Islands, after some years. Before he
died he wan forced out of Jeuit, the chief
port of entry of the group, by the Ger
mans gradually getting a foottiold and by
tbe imposition of a tax bis business wou'd
not stand. The Germans now have his
business. The Germans would do in
Samoa what they did in thÂ« Marshall
group.
"Mr. Moors is quite well known in San
Francisco. He has a fine hotel at Apia,
is the principal merchant there, and he
also has plantations." â¢,
A CRUEL DELUSION.
Mrs. Dr. Connelly Imagine* That Her
Children Are Dying of
Starvation.
Mrs. Kate Connelly, wife of fcr. Thomas
E. Connelly of 1420 Howard street, was
yesterday declared insane by Judge San
derson. Some time ago she was brought
before Judge Hebbard on complaint of
her husband, but was released, and tbe
doctor was roundly scored for an alleged
attempt to railroad his spouse to the
asylum.
A few days ago Mrs. Connelly went to
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children and complained to Charles P.
Welch, who is in charge there,* that her
four children were starving, and the
youngest, aged 14 months, almost dead.
said that her husband refused to pro
vide for his family. On investigation it
was discovered that the children were fat,
hearty and healthy.
Two days later Policeman F. W. Smith,
who patrols a Mission beat, was made a
confidant by Mrs. Connelly of her supposi
titious woes. The patrolman was accosted
about 2 o'clock in the morning by a
woman' who begged him to come with her
to her home, saying that her baby had
starved to death and that its corpse lay in
her bed. The policeman accompanied
Mrs. Connelly home and found a pretty
child sleeping peacefully.
Judge Sanderson, after listening to the
testimony and to Mrs. Connelly's story,
said that he was convinced of the insanity
of the accused, but as her mind seemed
sound on every subject but the one he was
loth to send her to an asylum. He finally
decided to give her a chance on the prom
ise that her relatives will have her placed
in a private institution and therÂ« subjected
to such restraint as will prevent her from
doing injury to herself or her children.
Mrs. O'Connor, the accused's mother,
claims that her daughter's mental condi
tion is due to severe beatings she has re
ceived at the hands of her husband. It is
said that Dr. Connelly has at various
times dragged his wife about the house by
her hair. >
GETTING IN NEW VOTERS
Fifteen Hundred Foreign Citizens
Have Been Natural
ized.
A Large Number of "Minors" Have
Taken Out Papers â Soldiers
Who Are Voters.
Nine more days remain for the citizen of
this City and County to get himself se
curely enrolled in the great register and
in a position to elect a President and
Vice-President next November. The
registration office is crowded, and it is
very probable that all the" names of those
qualified to vote this coming election will
[ be placed in the new register.
Another addition to the balloting
strength of the County will be the natural
ization list. Ever since the bureau opened
the residents of foreign birth have been
hurrying to the Superior Court rooms. A
large number of the applicants for suf
frage took out their "intention" papers
years ago and have neglected to use them
to complete the work of naturalization
until in many cases the documents have
become old and worn.
Yesterday eight or ten were filed in
| Judge Sanderson's court that were made
I out in the '70s . For almost twenty years
thoso half-way citizens had stood until
somebody convinced them that an Amer
ican voter was a sovereign in a republican
I way.
A large percentage of the applicants for
citizenship are "minors" or foreigners who
have come to the United States under the
age of 18 years. Tbi3 fact exempts them
from the necessity of taking out iutention
papers and residing in tne country the re
quired num^r of years.
It is renn>,kable how many have come
here whose ages have been just between 17
and 18. One man, 45 years of age, swore
that he had lauded in the United States
when he was 17.
"Why did you not take out your papers
before?" asked the Judge, severely. "l r ou
have accumulated property here. Did
you not care to vote? Have you any
patriotism?"
"Oh, I didn't think much about the
matter," was the indifferent answer.
"I would almost be justified in refusing
your application," said the Judge.
"A man â an alien â who would live
here twenty -jsight years without citizen-,
ship can get along the remainder of his
life."
However, as two witnesses swore that
his statement was correct, he was admit
ted with a crisp judicial lecture upon his
negligence to assume his burden of the
great Republic's government.
It is possible that his age at the time of
his disembarkation on these shores was far
above the juvenile 17 and that it will be
many years before he will have been
twenty-eight years in this country.
The Superior Juuges exercise the great
eat care in examining the subjects, and a
large percentage of the "17-year-olds" are
rejected. They get tripped-up on their
dates regarding events known to every
native scuoolboy and retire in confusion.
One applicant, who had been a resident
for over twenty years on his own showing,
thought the War of the Rebellion occurred
before the conflict with Mexico. He was
rejected. Another, who had lived here
long enough to raise an American son to
the age of 21, according to his own state
ment,.wanted to accompany his boy to
fie polls.
He appeared for enfranchisement prin
cipally because the young fellow had
twitted him upon being a foreigner.
There Have been over 1500 persons nat
uralized during the last few weeks, and
yesterday 200 foreign residenters were
made voters. About 50 per cent of the
number admitted to citizenship are natives
of Germany and Sweden. The next higher
percentages are Italians, Irishmen and
Danes. The next in line are Englishmen
and Canadians. Quite a number of sol
diers of foreign birth in the United States
army have alsa taken out citizenship pa
pers. Their enlistment really makes them
citizens, but to become qualified electors
they must certify to a five years' residence
in the country with two witnesses. â¬f they
have a service discharge at the expiration
of a five years' enlistment that paper is an
efficient witness of their eligibility, and
only one other witness is necessary to es
tablish the right to the ballot.
Judge Sanderson, in Depertment 7 of
the Superior Court, will be od duty to-day
for naturalization work.
An Intelligent Article.
No person interested in the political sit
uation to-day should fail to read an able
editorial in this week's News-Letter
wherein the statement of Mr. Bryan, the
"boy-orator," that "he stands where Jef
ferson stood" is completely punctured.
The lucid editorials on political and other
topics appearing in this up-to-date jour
nal for the intelligent and cultured classes
are beine copied from end of the country

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 1, 1596.
SOUGHT DEATH
IN AN ICE-CHEST
Jacob Pape, Saloon-Keeper,
Ends His Life in a
Novel Way.
WAS SHORT OF FUNDS.
He Had Met With Severe Losses
During the Past Four
or Five Years.
KILLS HIMSELF WITH GAS.
By Means of a Rubber Hose His Beer
Refrigerator Becomes a Death-
Chamber.
Jacob Pape, a saloon-keeper at 117
O'Farrell street, committed suicide yester
day morning in a peculiarly novel way.
He attached a rubber hose from a gasjet
THE REFRIGERATOR WHERE JACOB PAPE ENDED HIS LIFE.
to the beer refrigerator and then crawling
into the cooling-box asphyxiated himself.
Of the suicides reported at .the Morgue
within the past twelve months the method
adopted by Pape was certainly the most
extraordinary.
During the past few months Pape has
been v^ry despondent. He was very short
of money and for two days past has com
plained to his friends that municipal and
internal revenue taxes were due and that
he was without the means to pay them.
To this fact is attributed the rash act.
Heretofore it has been the custom of the
deceased to close his saloon about 1 a. m.,
going directly to his home, 516 O'Farreli
street. Yesterday morning he did not
come as usual. After waiting an hour,
Mrs. Pape, accompanied by her son, went
to the saloon to see what was detaining
her husband. It has been Pape's custom
to fasten tlie door on the outside with a.
padlock, but on this occasion it waa se
curely bolted frpm within.
The wife and ton then forced an en
trance, but no sooner had they crossed the
threshold than a strong odor of gas as
sailed them. For ten minutes \ox more'
they searched for the source of the escap
ing gas and then young Pape observed a
hose running from the jet to the refrig
erator. A Rood-sized hole had been bored
into the side of the latter, the rubber tubing
forced through and the sides packed care
fully with cotton.
Hastily throwing open the door, Pape
saw his fattier sitting in one corner as
though adeep. It was but the work of a
moment to jerk the elder Pape out of
the death-trap and carry him to a place
where pure air abounded. It was no use,
however, for death had been present long
enough for the body to be icy cold.
Pape made preparations for his death
with unusual care and deliberation. From
the best information obtainable he closed ;
his saloon about 11 o'clock Thursday night. !
He then bored a hole into the refrigera
tor and then attached a hose to the gasjet
some eight feet away. This done Pape re
moved the beer kegs from the ice-chest
and then walked into the improvised
death-trap, pulling the aoor after him. A
snap lock. which can only be reached from
the outside made him as much of a pris
oner as though he had been behind steel
bars.
On a table, near the gasjet, was found
the following card:
Jttly 29, 189 G.
In case I should die have the California Un
dertakers. Hurry me to 123 Stockton street.
Jacob Papk.
Pape was an old-time saloon man and
was well provided for financially at one
time. He has lost considerable money
within the past few years in various specu
lations. This, combined with a decreas
ing business, is supposed to have prompted
the suicide. Pape was 48 years old and
left a widow and son.
ABOUT THE CHARTER.
Wheeling (W. Ya.) Desire* Information
on the Proposed Instrument From
the Merchants.
The following letter from Wheeling, W.
Va., was recently received by the Mer
chants' Ascociation relative to the pro
posed new charter:
Whekltng, W. Va., July 20, 1896.
To the Merchants' Association, San Francisco,
Cal.â Gentlemen: I am attorney for a com
mission employed by the city of Wheeling lo
make a general revision of the city charter,
and am desirous of ODtaining information and
precedents that may be valuable in tha prepa
ration of the work.
I attended the recent Municipal League Con
vention in Baltimore, and have had some cor
respondence witn some of the gentlemen
whom 1 met there. Mr. Woodruff, the secre
tary of the league, has given me your name,
saying that your city is busy with a charter
agitation, and that you may be able to furnish
valuable assistance In our work. The subject
upon which we seem to be most in need of
light is that of provisions lor the raising of
municipal revenue, and the administrative
functions which control aim account for the j
expenditure thereof.
I may not be able to give much Information j
In reciprocation of Â«ny favor you may bes tuw. '
We have not had much experience out of the
usual line, unless It be in our municipal own
ership and control oi water works, gas works
anq electric-light plants. Our work of revision
of tne charter has not yet progressed very far,
and none of it has yet been printed.
I will be very greatly obliged for any assist
ance you maybe able to fender without put
ting yourself to any inconvenience. Yours
very truly, WiLLiAst Ebskine.
In answer the Merchants' Association
has forwarded a copy of the following
letter:
William Frsline, Attorney to the Charter Com
misnion. Wheeling, W. Va.â Dear Sik: Replying
to your esteemed favor of the 20th inst. we
send you a copy oi the synopsis of the charter
issued by^iis association for general distri
bution. 'pF'ias been carefully compiled and
contains all the essential features of the
charter concisely stated. It will probably
serve the purpose of showing you the salient
points of the article upon revenue and taxa
tion, of which you mate special inquiry.
Permit us to express the sincere hope that
the city oi Wheeling muy join the -auspicious
movement for municipal progress, now so gen
eral among American cities. The best thought
of the Republic is at present turned to the
improvement of municipal government. No
city requires a new charter more than San
Francisco. Under the present obsolete form
of our City government defective methods
have wrought incalculable injury to the City
and the spirit of progressiveness seems stifled.
The new charter is infinitely superior to the
existing government of San Francisco and
there is an encouraging prospect of its ratifi
cation on November 3 and subsequent by tbe
Legislature. Â
You state that Wheeling has had special ex
perience in municipal ownershsp of public
utilities, such as water works, gas "works and
electric-light planjs. It would be esteemed a
favor by this association to know the results
of your experience in the important subject of
municipal ownership and how the ownership
was brought about and maintained.' With
best wishes we remain, yours very ruly,
Mekcii ants' Association.

Charles F. Myer Accused of Obtaining
â¢ Judgment in His Favor by
Fraud.
Whdt promises to be a very spirited con
test for the annulment of a decree of di
vorce is to come upln Judge Slack's
court. The parties to the suit are Charles
F. the firm of .Meyer it A k maun.
located at 16 and 18 Sacramento street,
and interested in the West Coast Steam
ship and Navieation Company, and his
former w>fe, living with her mother at 826
California street,- whose maiden name is
Marie A. Brownell.
According to the tale of the bride and
Her attorney, J. C. Calhain, Marie A.
Brownell was married secretly to. Meyer
in Oakland. July 30, 1894. At that time
she was a child only 16 years of age.
When they returned to this City the
lady asserts that her husband asked her
to keep the marriage a secret, as he was
expecting a large sum of money from his
father and thoupht the news of his mar
riage might interfere with it.
Trusting implicitly in her husband's in
tegrity, Mrs. Meyer returned to live with
her mother on Post street. An agreement
was made that they should not live to-
I gether as man and wife until Myer had
j settled accounts with his father, but this
agreement was not kept.
In November, when Mrs. Myer was on a
visit to San Pedro, she was astonished and
dismayed to learn that her husband had
filed a suit for divorce in Judge Sewalt's
court. She returned and upbraided him,
but was pacified with tha explanation, she
declares, that he had done this only to
allay the anger of bis fatLer, who had dis
covered the fact of his marriage.
She further states that he told her not
to bother about the matter nor see an at
torney and take any legal steps, as he in
tended to have the suit quietly dismissed
without his father's knowledge, and the
settlement with the latter would soon be
arranged sn that he could come out boldly
I and proclaim her his lawful wife. She ao
! cepted the explanation he is said to have
| made without more ado.
In December she learned that Myer's
petition for divorce had been granted.
What was worse, it had been granted on
tne ground of infidelity. It was a cruel
blow to the little woman, and coming as
it did when she was in very delicate
health, completely prostrated her.
In the meantime Myer had remarried,
and he now has a child by his second
wife.
About four months ago her attorney, J.
0. Calhain, who is now in the East, filed a
suit for annulment of the decree of divorce
in Judge Slack's court. A demurrer to
the same was entered by the defendant
about two weets ago. The original com
plaint has since been amended.
A few days ago the plaintiff consulted
with Attorney Gavin McNab and asked
him to enter the suit in her behalf.- At
torney McNab stated yesterday that a
transfer of attorneys had not yet been
made and he could not state positively
that such would occur. For thi3 reason
he cared to have nothing to say. He con
fessed, however, that he had been exam
ining the case and would make a definite
statement next week.

HIS DISBARMENT ASKED FOB.
Southern Pacific â¢ Discovers a Leak
and Endeavors to Punish the
Alleged Cu'ppit
For attorneys who are not upon its pay
roll the Southern Pacific Company has no
love. An illustration of this truth has
just corxje home to Cassius M. Jennings, a
lawyer who has been in practice in San
Francisco since 1882, and who won some
prominence through his advocacy of the c
claims of "Stop-Over" Robinson against the
Southern Pacific Company. He is accused
by Byron Waters, the claims attorney of
the Southern Pacific, with unprofessional
conduct, and a petition for his disbarment
has been filed in the Supreme Court.
James H. Allison, a young man, re
cently the confidential clerk of Waters, Is
also accused of having betrayed the busi
ness secrets of the company to Jennings,
and has, accordingly, been dismissed from
his position.
The claims attorney is the custodian of
numerous valuable papers, showing in de
tail the circumstances; of accident cases,
Jhe names of witnesses, etc., in which the
Southern Pacific Company, the Market
sjtreet Railway Company, etc., might be
heJd liable for damages.
In his complaint Attorney Waters al
leges that recently Allison, his confiden
tial clerk, who had the papers in his keep
ing; offered to give away the information
they contained to Jennings for a consid-'
eration, so as "to enable him (Jennings)
to procure the claimants as his clients and
be in a position to negotiate successfully
settlements or to bring suits."
Â« It is also alleged that "in violation of
his oath as an attorney of this court and
in violation of his duty as an attorney of
this court the said Jennings corruptly
agreed with the said Allison that he would
divide with the said Aliison all the gains
he might acquire in the settlement of the
said claims. â
When Attorney Waters last Friday
learned what was going on he sent for
Jennings and read the riot act to him and
to Allison, who was summarily dismissed.-
It is also claimed that Jennings and Alli
son have admitted their complicity.
This is the story of Waters, but between
it and the statements of Messrs. Jennings
and Allison there are several notable dis
crepancies.
â¢'I resigned my clerkship," said Alli
son, "in June, the resignation to take
effect this month. I had been in the em
ploy of the company for' several years; my
health wa3 beginning to fail and I decided
to take a rest. Mr. Jennings suggested
that I had valuable information relative
to accidents which I might supply him.
I consented, and he told me that what
ever" fees he received from the settlements
of the cases he would divide with me.
Such was the agreement, but I never re
ceived any money from Jennings, although
I gave him the facts in many cases."
3 "l.have to say," said Mr. Jennings, "in
answer to thÂ» accusations preferred against
me by Byron Waters, that I am entirely
innocent of any unprofessional conduct,
though. I may haye o been over zealous in
my efforts to securabnsiness.
"L make a 'specialty of accident cases,
many of which I have settled out of court
.upon a satisfactory basis to the Southern
Pacific Company and many others 1 have
i won. I krTew Allison by sight. About
Â°| the 10th of this month he came unexpect
! edly to my office. He told me that he had
sent in= his, resignation to the Southern
j Pacific Company and would like to come
into ray office to study law. He also said
that he could bring me lots of business. I
answered that I was looking for business
and would divide with him the profits on J
' any he could secure. He said the South
jern Pacific Company had treated him
badly, mentioned the names of some per
sons who had been hurt, were without at
torneys and whose claims had not been
adjusted.
"He called npon me several times at
later dates and- brought notes of numerous
accidents, etc. I wrote to a few of the
claimants and invited them to call on me
at my office. Concerning three of the"
cases,! spoke to Mr. Waters. In none of
these cases did I realize anything nor were
there any suits brought. If Waters set
tled any of the claims he did so without
any intervention of mine.
"Last Saturday Mr. Waters sent for me,
swore at me and talked brutally, saying
that I had got the upper hand of him in
several cases of merit and that he wished
me to return the memoranda I had of
them. I was taken by surprise and men
tally upset for a time, but I gave him
back every scrap of paper in my posses
sion. I did not then think that any fur
ther publicity would be given the matter.
The information given me by Allison was
no secret; any pergon interested has the
right to demand fts production by the
company.
"The milk in the cocoanut is, I think,
that I am one of the attorpsys of Dr. Rob
inson, who, as you know, has been en
gaged in a bitter litigation with the com
pany for the last four or five years. For
this reason it occurred to the Southern
Pacific Company that I was a thorn in its
side, and so it set this trap to turn me
down."
Emmet Bagley, for many years past the
librarian of the law department of the
Southern Pacific Company, was yesterday
appointed to succeed Allison in the office
of Attorney Waters.

There will be two interesting road races
across the bay to-morrow, those of the
Acme and Reliance Club Wheelmen of
Oakland. The entries for the Acme event
will not be known until to-day. The race
is the last of a series for a handsome cup,
dtcided by points, and P. M. Lefevre leads
the others. So far it seems unlikely
that any one caÂ» wrest it from him. The
entries for the Rehanee event and their

The Olympic Club Wheelmen will have
a run to tbe Park and Presidio to-mor
row, leaving the club at 10 a. m. After the
run the members vrill go to the Olympic
grounds and 'have a game of baseball and
some informal races. The club's road race
has been postponed to August 16. There
will be a moonlight ride to Stockton by
ooat August 22 and 23 and a theater party
later in the month.
The California Cycling Club will have a
run to the Park aud Cliff House to-mor
row, leaving at 9:30 a. m. There will be a
smoker for members only this evening.
The management of the Hotel Rafael,
in conjunction, with the San Rafael Cycling
Club and that charming writer on cycle
topics, "Madge," are arranging some bi
cycle races to be held at San" Rafael
shortly. There will be a two-mile and a
a five-mile handicap, amateur. The idea
is to make the affair a sort of picnic, with
the races and a splenid lunch as the
drawing cards. All the prominent clubs
of this City will be invited. The handi
capping will be done by R. A. Smyth, of
ficial handicapper of the L. A. W. It
promises to be a big event, and is already
being talked about considerably around
the clubs.

William Yeoman of the Reliance Club
Wheelmen, Oakland, is considerably an
noyed over the account of the recent
twenty-mile roadrace, claiming that the
alleged foul was as much the fault of the
Bay City rider, Menne, as it was his.
Nothing similar to this has ever been at
tributed to Yeoman before and he has
always borne the reputation of being a
square, honest rider. Menne still sticks
to his story that he was fouled, but is now
inclined to qualify it with tbe additional
remark that perhaps it was done accident
ally or without malice intent by Yeoman,
who, he thinks, would not wilfully foul
any one. As both men are well known on
the cycle path as honest sportsmen and
the veracity of neither can for a moment
be questioned, the collision and subse
quent wrangle over it were unfortunate,
and it seems to me the best thing to be
done is to drop the subject.
Captain Argenti has called a run of the
Camera Club Cyclists to San Jose for to
morrow on the Oakland side of the bay.
The riders will carry lunch, to be eaten on
Penetentia Creek, near Alum Rock. The
distance of the' run is about forty-two
miles. The return will be made by train.
President Harlow H. White of the Cali
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs leaves on
this evening's train for Sisson, from
which point he will journey to the Mc-
Cloud River in company with a Mr. Mc-
Guire in search of fish and game. He will
be away a fortnight. In his absence Jo
seph A. Desimone of San Jose, vice-presi
dent of the association, will preside at its
meeting at the Reliance Club, Oakland,
to-night, when considerable important
business will be brought up for action.
The Liberty Cycling Club will hold a
smoker this evening. at its clubrooms, at
Twentieth and Folsom streets.
The Outing Road Club will go to Hay
wards to-morrow to witness the road
races. The club will also go to Stockton
on the 9th to attend the watermelon run
of the Terminal City Wheelmen.

at the Acme Club next Monday evening
to complete arrangements. The race
would be of considerable interest, on ac
count of the number of fast road riders
across the bay and because of its novelty,
there Deing no similar event held by the
associated clubs or any of the individual
clubs.
Sanford Plummer, official referee of the
League of American Wheelmen for this
district and ex-captain of the Bay City
Wheelmen, limped around to the Bay City
clubhouse Thursday night and appeared
so changed that hia fellow-members hardly
knew him. "Sandy" has recently gone
through a severe spell of sickness, and has
dropped in weight from 166 to 131 pounds.
His complaint was acute gastritis. He is
now past the danger point and mend in i*

again have the pleasure of hearing his
merry voice sing out, "Get off the track."

out at Mill Valley last Sunday, capturing
the quiet town and its fair ones together.
Next Sunday week they will go to Stock

Another very interestine letter has been
received by the writer from R. P. Ayl
ward, the well-known trainer of Otto
Ziegler Jr., the California champion, now
following the National racing circuit. Mr.
Aylward's letters are always breezy and
full of news, anecdotes ana the like, and I
always enjoy reading them and giving
them to the readers of The Call, Ayl
ward is a splendid trainer, and there is
probably no one in the business who can
show him a trick. The marked improve
ment in Ziegler's form over his showing of
last year is ample proof of this. The
Californian has never been anywhere but
near the top of the latter since he joined
the circuit, sharing the honors with
Cooper, Bald and Sanger, and it would be
very little of a surprise to me if with Ayl
ward's help he passed them all in the per
centage table before long.
Aylward's letter is given in fall as
follows:
Lima, Ohio, Jnly 24, 1896.
H. W. Spalding, Cycling Editor San Francisco
Call: Here we are in this little burg patiently
waiting for the weather to clear up, and while
waiting I will tell you what has happened
since my last letter to you.
Otto was not feeling well when we left
Chicago so I decided to skip the meet at Battle
Creek and get a rest at ''alamazoo. We were
just comfortably located at the above place
when we received a telegram from the referee
of the Battle Creek meet stating we must
make our appearance on the track at Battle
Creek or suffer suspension. So 1 took Otto up
and showed his condition and he was excused.
On the circuit down south almost all of the
boys had contracted malaria and the effects of
it were jut now showing up on their systems,
and iv Otto's case it broke out on his lips
similar to a cold sore. Although It did not
necessitate his going to bed at the same time
it made him feel very uncomfortable and he
could not do justice to himself while in this
condition. At Peoria he first felt the effects of
the southern trip and is just now getting over
At Kalamazoo he did some very good riding.
In the half-mile open he ran Bald so close that
it was a question who had crossed the tape
first. When it was announced that Bald had
won first place the grand-stand hisse4*Â«nf!
shouted, "Ziegler! Ziegler 1 Who won the
race? Ziegler! Zieglerr' Although I was not
in a position to say exactly who had Won. it
looked to me like Otto s win. In the mile
open the second day he was pocketed and
cou'.a not get out to sprint at all.
Bald is riding like a fiend, and so is Cooper
I think Bald is still the best man.
At Battle Creek Bald defeated Tom by at
least four wheel lengths by making his desper

ate jump. In the mile Tom beat him, but it
was Eddie's fault that Tom won. Eddie
started the sprint at the three-quarter and
gradually increased the pace, with Tom tacked
on. It was a sleigh ride for Tom and an easy
matter for him to jump Eddie at the tape. At
Kalamazoo, in the half-mile, Tom was not
placed. The mile open the second day was
the prettiest race run so far this season, Bald,
Cooper and Sanger finishing: almost abreast."
Sanger made the great ride, though, coming
up irom the rear of tbe bunch on the last
eighth; the big fellow, dressed in a suit of
black with broad, white stripes, seemed to be
riding two lengths to the others' one.
Loughead, the Canadian, is riding very
well and has taken Otto's place on the per
centage table. He has left the National cir
cuit, however, to follow the Illinois State cir
cuit. Gardiner has been^ai"! off for a rest. He
hns not been himself since the southern trip.
He Will meet the push here and follow with us
again.
Charlie Wells, who has been at Hot Springs
for the past six weeks, is again with us and
looking splendid, though he is a little down in
weight. It is like old times to have Charlie

I have not told you of the Detroit meet. It
seems that there is a greatdeal of rivalry and
prejudice existing between the race-meet pro
moters at this place, and when one cUib had
applied for a sanction of the National circuit
the other club or party immediately bought
an option on all tracks in Detroit on 3 the date
given for the National circuit meet, so the
promoters had to go to Windsor, Canada, to
hold the races. There was a very good at
tendance, however, and the races came off in
good order. Cooper did not ride the first day,
so Bald of course had the big race. In this
Otto rode like a sausage and was unplaced. In
the mile handicap he made a desperate rfde
and although he was unplaced the ride was a
very creditable one. He rode from scratch In
2:06, which is world's handicap record. The
I time is not official, as only one watch caught
him.
Cooper beat Bald in the mile on the second
day and it was Indeed a popular win. The
grand stand shouted themsejves hoarse for
their bey Tom.
Eddie was ] ocketed, however, by Jay Eaton
and could not ret out in time to give Tom a
run. Louehead second and Bald third.
In all probability the races here will be post
pined, as it is still' raining very hard.
Now, I want to teil you a little regarding
the Louisville meet. What a pleasure it would
be to fee some of our California friends at
this meet. Charlie Wells, Otto Ziegler and I
were talking it over last night, and if we could
only enthuse some of the boys I feel sure they
would not miss this great event. The '96
Meet Club are making elaborate preparations
ior the entertainment of visiting wheelmen,
and I assure you that those who come will be
well paid in pleasure and exciting races dur
ing their stay at Louisville. Both Charlie and
Otto will be in excellent form for this meet
and will try their Denver tactics of '94 over
again.
By the way, I met Percy Long at the races at
Chicago on the 10th inst.
Remember me kindly to inquiring friends.
Yours sincerely, K. P. Aylwakd.

The Pish and Game Commissioners, or
rather the Fish Commissioners, have been
notified that deer-hunters are shipping in
butter boxes ftoia Novato and vicinity the
carcases of does and fawns to dealers in
San Rafael and this City. There is sup
posed to be a game warden in this City
whose duty is to look out for the trans
gressors of the game law. Nothing hais
been heard of the game warden for several
months.
Mr. Osborne of the Tamalpais Club
bagged a spiked buck last Sunday lhat
dressed ninety-five pounds.
On Sunday last Otto Bransdorff saved
the life of a doe that was pursued by dogs,
and to escape with its life it swam across
San Andreas Lake. Two angler* who saw
the deer swimming gave it chase in their
boats, intending to dispatch it with a
pistol siot when the deer reached the east
side of the lake.
Bransdorff rowed rapidly in his angling
skiff, and arrived just in time to prevent
his brother anglers from committing an
act which might have landed them in
prison.
Bransdorff," pointing at the deer's head,
stated most emphatically that he would
cause the arrest of the men if they at
tempted to shoot. They were ignorant" of
the law, but when the/ realized that a
shot at a doe* might cost them more than
the game was worth they quickly -put
their pistols away and watched the deer
as it left the water and scampered over the
hills.
James Kerr is probably one of .the best
rifle shots in San Mateo County, but wtien
James draws a deadline on a buck stand
ing broadside and within fifty yards' of
his rifle and scores a clean miss, then
highly colored adjectives invariably fol
low.
One morning, recently, while Mr. Kerr
was looking ap some stray chickens, he
espied two fine deer feeding in his goat
patch. Â«
"That's meat for me," chuckled James
to himself, and he hurried back to the
ranchhouse for his trusty gun.
Taking a snap-shot inspection of the
Winchester he judged that eVerything
was all right and quickly Started back to
interview his game. The deer were feed
ing, as before stated, and paid no atten
tion to the champion turkey-shooter of
San Mateo County until he got within
fifty yards of tlieru. ,
Kerr fired and missed. The deer made a
few bounds and again stopped, giving the
marksman another beautiml shot.- The
second and t'ird sliots proved to be fail
ures, afte^r which the wearers of the forked
horns "tumbled" to the racket and' soon
disappeared in the deep canyon.
. On an examination of the rifle, which
quickly followed the disappearance of the
game, Mi. Kerr discovered, that the front
sight had been raised from the 100-yard to
the 400-yard notch, and the alterations
lost him two beautiful deer. The disap
pointed sportsman discovered afterward,
on inquiry, that Al Smith, "the hermit of
the laKe," was shooting swallows on the
wing at long range tde Sunday previom
with the rifle and he neglected to rear
range tbre sights.
Sportsmen, as a genernl thing, hear of
strange happenings to hunters, many of
wtiich seem incredible. The following
letter, which recently appeared "in a Colo
rado paper,- is the kingpin deer story of
the season. It says:
The last time I was deer hunting I made two
shots that were ?o remarkable I think they are
worth relating: On rounding a small hill I
observed three deer watching me. I selected
a large buck, which was standing broadside,
and fired.' He made two plunges and fell, but
immediately regiiined his feet, and with one
more jump was over the hill. I followed his
trail some fifty yards when I observed him
lying down, and I fired agnin and this time
broke his neck. On looking to see where the
first shot struck him I was surprised to find
that I had cut six holes in the hide with one
bullet. The buck, as stated above, was stand
ing broadside, and the ball made two holes in
the foreleg, and being just high enough to pass
through the lower part of the brisket cut two
holes in it, and passing out through the other
foreleg, cut two more holes.
To one familiar with the anatomy of the
deer, this will seem at flrsi an impossible shot,
but on closer observation it will be seen that
jt is possible, providing the ball does not enter
ihe leg too far forward. In this instance the
ball entered the ieg just far enough forward
to cut the cords of both legs and not break a
bone. The second shot was at a fawn standing
in front of a large rock. The bullet passed
through th ! deer, hit against the rock and
glanced off, hitting another rock, which so
turned it that it fell at my feet. 1 have the
dvi let now, and on it one can see the blood
from the deer, the sandstone from the first
lock and particles of stone from the second
rock.
Rattlesnakes are singularly plentiful in
the hills and canyons near Pieta this year,
and hunters are consequently giving the
place a wide berth.
THE CARSMEN
Crews That Will Participate In the
Stockton Regatta.
Local boat clubs are making extensive
preparations for the championship re
gatta at Stockton on September 9. Every
club has a full contingent of oarsmen now
in active training and the present outlook
for a large entry list is very bright.
Tne South End and Pioneer clubs, who
have been handicapped in past regattas by
not having outrigger skiffp, have each
given orders for this style of boat and soon
.every club on the bay will be equipped
with them, and as each club intends to
make an entry for every event on the
programme of the Stockton regatta it will
be quite interesting to note which club
carries off the lion's Bhare of the victories.
The South End Club has John Foley in
the junior single scull, and Gus Carson,
the afterwaist man of the club's cham
pion senior crew, will row in the junior
outrigger race. Frank Duplissea, the coast
champion single-sculler, will wear South
End colors in the senior singie-scuil event.
The club will be very strongly repre
sented in the four-oared barge races and
in the junior barge the following crew
will row: T. Fitzpatrick, stroke; Thomas
Casserly, afterwaist; Georee Fox, foward
waist; James Foley, bow; George McGrill,
coxswain. This crew has just been organ
ized and is made up of all crack bicycle
riders, who have given up wheeling and
taken to rowing.
The Intermediate race will see the fol
lowing plucky crew of the South Ends on
the line : Ed Scully, stroke ; James Pallas,
afterwaist; Matt Breen. forward waist;
Ed Tobin, bow, and George McGrill cox
swain. This crew defeated Stockton's
crack junior crew at Stockton oo last
Fourth of Jnly. ana were defeated by the
giant crew of Stockton by only four feet in
a mile and a half race at El Campo on
May 30.
" In the senior four-oared barge event, the
South Ends will enter their crack senior
crew, who have brought a victory to the
club in every regatta held during the past
two year*.
Following is its personnel: Frank| Du
plissea, stroke; Gus Carson, afterwaist;
Bob McArthur, forwardwaist; Henry
Bode, bow, and George McGrill, Coxswain.
Frank Duplissea, who has been rusti
cating in the country, has returned, and is
now training hard for his match with Mc-
Causland. He has filled out considerably,
and if he wins at Stockton he will tackle
some of the northern scullers.
The Olympic Club has borrowed the
South End's barge Blistpr, and will enter
the following crew on the 9th Â°of Septem
ber: Bob Collins, bow,; Paul Sturdivant,
forwardwaist; Percy Morse, aiterwaist;
Jim McElroy, stroke, and Tommy Guil
leather, coxswain.
THE ANGLER.
Good Bass Fishing In Russian River.
How Streams Are Stocked
With Trout.
According to the, letters which have
been received at this office from stations"
near the Russian River, black bass fishing
affords good sport to anglers.
. For some strange reason trout and bass
fishing at Sarf Andreas Lake is very poor.
The bass in the lakes of the Spring Valley
.Wa^er Company "are not fit to eat this
yeat.^s they taste strongly oÂ£ the de
cayed vegetation, which also gives a very
unpleasant flavor to the water. It is said
that the company is seriously thinking of
removing the tons of dead weeds and
watergrass which line the bottom of San
Andreas and Crystal Spring lakes.
Bas s fishing â is first class at Tenner
Lake, whic h is located about four miles
from .Cisco. Mr. Finch caughf twenty,
two bass in less than one hour's fishing
on this lake one day last week, and he en
joyed the sport greatly because tbe fish
were caught by means of fly castings.
Those which he shipped to his friends in
this City ran from one-half to one pound
in weight and were of excellent flavor.
In a recent report of the Fiso Com-,
missiorrers relative to the stocking of
streams with the fry of cutthroat and
rainDow trout, it is stated that Sonoma and
Paper;mill Â°creeks were stocked with sev
eral thousand young cutthroats. If the
many other streams which have also
been stocked by the Commission "pan
out" a.s well as the Sonoma and Paper
mill creeks anglers need not expect to
have much sport in the future, as the
scale of a cutthroat has not been taken
from either of the streams mentioned this
season. .
Anglers say that it is very doubtful if a
cutthroat â that is, under the system of
stocking as now employed by the commis
sion â will ever be taken from the creeks
within easy reach of this City. It has
been learned-tha t a year or so ago a deputy
of the Fish Commission journeyed to a
point near tbe confluence of the Lagunit^s
and Paper-mill creeks and dumped a few
cans of little fishes into tbs water where
they could be readily devoured by the
large trout, native to the stream. This is
what the commission calls "stocking"
streams, but of course there never was nor
will there ever be any favorable results
accruing from this crude and wasteful
system of planting young fishes.
The Fish Commissioners of Sew York
State have learned by long experience and
careful study that the planting of troiit
fry under a year is a waste of time and
expense, but it is presumed that the Cali
fornia Commissioners can give their con
freres of the East a lesson in trout propa
gation, etc.
John McDonald of Boca shipped a mag
nificent 6^Â£-pound rainbow trout to Henry
Skinner of E. T. Allen Company last
Wednesday, to which justice was done by
the members of the San Francisco Rod
and Gun Club at their quarterly banquet.
Tbe fish was pronounced excellent and of
splendid flavor.
George Walker, Joseph Kelly and Wil
liam Cooper will shortly leave for a few
weeks' trout-fishing on the Truckee River.
The stream is yet too high for good fly

Charles Green and three companions are
now angling for bass at Russian River

near Guerneville is first-class at present.
The spoon and minnow are the successful

Sacramento Sporting: News.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 31.â The success
attained at the indoor bicycle tournament in
the breaking of world's records has encour
aged local taleut to make another try, and in
consequence a blue-ribbon night will be held
to-nigbt. There is a movement on foot to at
tempt to procure a purse during the coming *
State' Fair for a race between W. A. Terrill
(whose fair riding during the tournament
made him a host of friends in this city) and
the fastest horse entered. Should the scheme
be successful, it is believed that it will be the
drawing-card of the State meet.
The Capitol City Wheelmen are practicing a
series of drill exercises, and are jnaking great
progress. One of the most successful is a
movement in'a hollow square. Within a short
time the club members will hold a road race
for club prizes, and a:i excursion to Stockton
"on the 9th of August is on the tapis.
Stewart Upson of this city will leave to
morrow for a bicycle trip over the Sierras to \
determine the best route to be followed by the I
riders of the trans-continental relay race. He 1
will follow the track of the Central Pacific to :
Truckee and will then make a fishing trip
through tbe mountains of the Sierras, return- |
ing by way of Lake Tahoe and Placerville,
mttking a personal observation of both rt>utes.
Local riders are all in favor of the Placerville
, route, claiming that better tiipe can be made.
Upson is a typical sportsman, nnd holds the
Pacific Coast records for one-half and one mile
bicycle competition, and in 1895 held the
world's record for the quarter, since bested one
fifth of a second. In 1893 he entered in eight
een events and took place in sixteen of them,
winning more honors for Sacramento than all
other riders put together. He is a cracker
jack at the trap and in the field, an enthusi
ast with the rod and high up in. tennis circles.
Dr. Huntington, Joe Terry and William Ger
ber leave shortly for Wells, Nev., where they
will spend two weeks among the prairie
chickens. \\. H. Eckhardt and party leave to
morrow for i six. weeks' camping trip in the
Klamath River district. William Willis, sport
ing editor of the Record-Union, leaves on the
Ist for Truckee, where he will spend two weeks
among the trout. A party of Sacramentans
who went up last week report that the fishing
in the vicinity of Truckee is not of the best,
but their ill success is attributed in part to the
heavy rains which they encountered. G. H.
L&mmers, who hai been spending several
weeks in Spokane, Wash , states that the sur
rounding country is a- veritable sportsman's
paradise. In a day's fishing he took fifty
pounds of trout. Prairie chickens are numer
ous. Lammers saw twenty-four elk in one
band.
. Dove shooting is improving rapidly, the
birds being more plentiful. Westfall and
Shaw bagged ninety yesterday; Ely and
Knauer sixty. Kimball goes pot-hunting on
Sunday. D. R. Camper and G. P. Morse of
Chico passed through the city yesterday re
turning from a six weeks' bicycle tour throWh
the State. They went to Santa Cruz and Mon
terey, returning through Yosemite Valley
They report the roads good in the main, espel
dally over the Santa Cruz Mountains
Athletic club circes report renewed interest
with several local sparring matches in view.
Rctherford!
Stockton Snorting News.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 29.-That there will
be a bench show here during -fair week r now
seems to be an assured fact. This \ morning H ';
B. Sinclair .; of i San Francisco arrived i for f the
purpose of consulting with the directors of the
San Joaqum Valley Agricultural Association
" tÂ» Us intentions with reference to holding a
pm*/ >> ? telegraphed for by President
Cobb.but the latter s was I called away by this
morning's . train â  and â¢ Secretary Doan * had to
arrange matters with the dog man In com
*â¢7n Wi^, John E - Doak itheyivisltedi the
It. lon this morning to see what space could
be set aside to bench the high breel canines
that are expected to be here during fair week
President Cobb's idea was to allot the %
part of the pavilion for the beifesh â  show dv
inspection to-day; developed lne fact that
thiÂ« will hardly give enough room to bench
the number of dogs that it is expected will be
here and give the visitors to the show enough
room in the aisles. For tnis reason the entire
northern wing of the big building will prob
ably be asked for, and this can be better
spared than any other portion of the building.
' Just now the dog-fanciers and kennel-owneri
of San Francisco and Oakland are looking for
ward to coming here and then going to Saa
Jose, where a bench and poultry show will bÂ«
held in October.
The Stockton show will be ahead of that at
San Jose, for it will bo held during the week
commencing September 20, and will last four
days, while the Garden City bench show will
not be open until some time in October.
The expense of holding the proposed ex
hibit of fancy-bred dogs wns discussed this
morning. If it can be arranged to have J.
Otis Fellows act as judge for. both Stockton
and San Jose be can probably be secured for
$150 for each show. The total expense of the
show cannot be much less than $900. accord
ing to the estimates made this morning. John
Heffernan and John E. Doak, both local dog
fanciers, figure the cost at something like
$6J>O. As the Agricultural Society is looking
at the show from a purely business standpoint
it will not be liable to undertake the venture
unless it sees its way clear to make something
front it. Â° c
At the lowest calculation Sinclair and Doak
figure that 225 dogs will be in the show.
It is not proposed to offer any cash prizes for
the winners, but to give silver medals to win
ners of first prizes and diplomas to winners of
seconds. The Spaniel. Fox Terrier and 8U
Bernard clubs will without doubt offer special
prizes outside of the association, which will
be an additional incentive for the owners of
valuable dogs in these classes to send them to
Stockton.
According to Doak there will be seventy-five
entries from this city alone.
Sinclair says that the members of the vari
ous kennel clubs in San Francisco have beeo
talking for some time of the' prospect of the
Kennel Club here holding a bench show and
have agreed if they can get the assistance of
the local club that they will charter a boat and
come up here in a body next September.
There will probably be two special prizes for
handlers o: dogs, one of $20 and one of $10, to
induce good dog handlers to come here.
What the kennel-owners want very much is
to establish a circuit, so that there will be a
regular route ior the dogs to travel each year.
The circuit v. ill be San Francisco, Oakland,
Los Aneeles, Stockton and San Jose in Califor
nia and Portland and Seattle.
The Agiicultural Association, If it under*
takes to Â£old the proposed^ show and others
each subsequent year, will apply at once for
membership in tne American Kennel Club.
The Divorce Courts.
John C. Davidson was yesterday granted a
divorce from Nellie Davidson because of tne
latter's willful desertion. The parties were
married in Ogden, Utah, in July, 1893, and
one Eftonth later, while on their wedding tour,
the bride deserted' her husband in Portland,
Or. She remarked as she left, '"The world is
broad enough for both of us." The saying
proved true, for Davidson has not seen iier
since. Judge Hebbard granted the decree.
Teresa M. McCaun obtained a divorce from
Alfred E. McCann on the ground of willful
.neglect on the }part of the husband. Judge
Hebbard awardefl the plaintiff the custody ofa
minor child, $10 per month alimony and $5O
counsel fees. .
Frances Toledo was granted a divorce from
M. Toledo. The parties were married twelve
years ago, and the defendant deserted his
bride a week after the ceremony. Judge Heb
bard made the decree.
i Laura M. Palmer was divorced from Telfourd
Palmer by Judge Daingerfield because of the
defendant's desertion.

Colonel George W. Bell, present United
State* Consul at Sydney, New South
Wales, on leave of absence to his home
country, addressed an audience at the
Chamber of Commerce yesterday after
noon at 3 o'clock. A number of ladies
were present.
Colonel Bell is very tall and very bald.
He is a native Virginian and speaks in the
leiaurely modulated tones peculiar to so
many Southerners. When he was ap
pointed .Consul by President Cleveland he
waÂ« a resident of Willipa, Wash. Colonei
Bell's eloquence haa been heard by many
a convention in that State. He will leave
thia evening for Portland, Tacoma and
Seattle, where he will also deliver ad
dresses to the Chambers of Commerce of
those cities.
A guest of the occasion was General
Manuel Barillas, ex-President of Guate
mala, who was accompanied by Pedro A.
Jtfeuni, president of the Guatemalan Rail
road, and the general's secretary and in
terpreter, Mr. Rives.
Consul Bell was felicitously introduced
by President Hugh Craig. The Consul
spoke substantially as follows :
Time and muscle were never so precious as
now. This is the grandest generation ever in
existence. I believe the world is improving
\vÂ« have leaped forward 1000 years in a gen
eration.
Thia is a commercial age, and we are in the
pawn of it â not at the high noon. Commerce is
the basis of civilization. We are the greatest
commercial generation of the ages. Commerce
always meant freedom. When Greece, Borne
ana the Arabians became the commercial cen
ter of the woria they became the intelligent
center also.
What brought about this age of ours T Great
commercial activity. If America had not
Deen discovered there would not have been a
steamboat or a railroad to-day. All nations
are trying to push their commerce into other
countries. Compare the conditions of the non
commercial nations of Europe with these of
the commercial nations. Compare England
with 40,000.000 people with Russia and her
125,000,000 of people. On the books of the
world we do not appear as a great commercial
nation, bm if all that comes into and goes out
oi the iorty-five States of the i." nion are con
sidered as imports and exports, as tney are
considered in the twenty countries of Europe,
we would be the greatest commercial nation.
The productive machine is the greatest
machine in the world, aud we need commerce
to equalize production and consumption.
Tltere can't be an overproduction till all the
pec pie of God are satisfied. We need adjust
ment and more commerce. Wants increase
with the ability to buy and more labor is re
quired to supply the want.
' The prophesy oi Seward ig already coming
trueâ that the Pacitie Coast is to become the
commercial center of the world. It was
thought that China and Japan never could
waie up, but they Lave been shocked by a new
idea. That is the commercial idea. China
and Japan, asleep for centuries, now awake
and appropriate what we have done in cen
turies, ii.ey are now stepping across into
civilization.
Ban Francisco lies at the gateway with 70,
--000,000 people behind her. We are the great
est manufacturing Nation in tbe world. Aus
tralia is as l^rge as the United States. Aus
tralia per capita is ihe greatest commercial
nation in the world. America has more of
what Australia wants than any other nation,
with the possible exception of England, and
we ought to have a share in her trade. But
we are iaulty in passing our products.
The Americans have not catered for tbe Aus
tralian trade nor an y other trade. Americans
bave the advantage oi location. Why are
these thine* so? it is a sad thing for us to
hee American ships sail out of fcydney harbor
in ballast.
Our trade Is in proportion to our ability to
get there. Transportation is as great a ques
tion as manufacturing. We get but 6 per cent
of the trade of Australasia and less than 2 per
ceatof the trade of byduey. The Australians
are more like Americans than any other peo
ple in the world, and I tell you there is no
prejudice in Australia against Americans, and
ihey like American goods.
Why don't we get there? Ten great steamer
Hues run into Sydney and fourteen to Austral
asia. A steamer for America leaves only once
a month, and here we are on the opposite
shore only 7000 miles away, with San'Fr&n
cijco and 70,000,000 of people The ships to
England are much larger and finer than those
that come to this country. There is a good
deal in appearances. Appearances are our
first impressions. If American ships were finer
half of the Australian traffic would come this
way, and acquaintance leads to commerce.
The English, French, German, China and
Japan iines are heaviiy subsidized. If one
great nation subsidizes a ship another nation
must do so or the first nation will carry the
trade. To-day we are paying foreign ships
$1,500,000 a year to carry our trade and we
are keeping alive foreign nations. If the
United states would subsidize her ships 5 per
cent of the sum that foreign ships are subsi
dized we could carry the trade. I think this
is worthy of consideration.
Thirty-five years ago we carried a third of
the tonnage of the world. To-day we carry 12
per cent of our o*n trade. We are falling a
little benind tUe procession.
We can change the commerce oi the world
by building the Nicaragua canal and make
>*ew York its center. [Applause.] If America
does not construct the canal some other nation
will, and then where are we?
I would that we had the purity of municipal
politics that they have in Sydney, but I would
not say that over tliere.
The American people mnst arouse or they
will fall behind the world in the struggle for
commercial supremacy.
A vote of thanks was returned to Con
sul Belt for his address.
General Barillas was then introduced
to the audience and he held a short recep
tion.
ROGERS FOR BRYAN â IF
Should the Haughty Democrats
Not Divide Up, Why
Then .
Sewail Has a Caance to Earn Immor-
tality by Simp y Resigning
the N- mination.
Taylor Rogers, fresh from St. Louis
and the Populist convention, took his
chair in the Mayor's oflÃce yesterday
morning and resumed the routine duties of
the secretaryship mucn as if the country
was reasonably safe. His little black
skull cap was adjusted at an angle a shade
more toward the west, perhaps, indicating
a jaunty confidence. There was, however,
in the tone of voice with which he began
to talk politics that which counteracted
the effect of the new angle of tbe sknll
cap.
Mr. Rogers is for Bryan if . He
voted steadily against him until the final
rollcall and then he answered "Bryan."
"In one sense I am pleased with the
choice; in another I am not," he said.
"Personally I like Bryan well enough,
and I went to St. Louis well disposed
toward him. He has long had strong
leaning toward Populism, has spoken for
them and has helped to elect some of
them to office. Still, as a straight Popu
list I would have very much preferred to
see a straight Populist nominated for the
highest office. I think it would have solid
ified the party and brought more substan
tial results.
"But viewing the situation as it was
from the whole environment* I believe it
was best to accept Bryan and thereby put
in force the silver reform, that in its train
all the other reforms for which Populists
are laboring may be set in motion.
"In accepting the candidate of the
Democratic platform, however, I wish it
may be said for me what Populism says to
Democracy: 'We meet you on a fair, open
plane, your equals â not your vassals. We
want a fair division of the honors and
prestige in tne event of success. If you
deny us this then, by the Eternal, Mc-
Kinley shall be the next President. 1
"Wnatdo we consider a fair division :
We will be satisfied with four of the nine
Presidential electors; three of the seven
Congressmen â that and nothing less. If
that be refused then we will fight till
Hades freezes up."
Mr. Rogers went on to tell the interest
ing story of how the Bryan men fought
and wonat St. Louis:
"When we arrived there we found the
Bryan men organized and in full working
order, with a crowd of rooters that greeted
ns at every turn with "Bahs for Bryan!'
This surprised us.
"The leaders were Weaver, Simpson and
Allen. They had come with the professed
intention of shoving Bryan down our
throats whether we wanted him or not.
They had headquarters at the .LindeH
House. Tl.ey were, of course, suoportetl
by agents of the Democratic party who
had two ends in viewâ that of securing
The Officers of Company B (the City Guard) and the Officers of the City Guard Club.
our immediate support in the campaign
and our ultimate destruction as a party.
Well, we met them, and, while .they se
cured our support for the head of the
ticket, we saved the party by repudiating
Sewall.
"Had they insisted on Sewall the party
would have split. I told them so on the
platform. 1 and a great many others
would bare walked out if Sewall had been
named. I believe the Democratic party
will get rid of Sewal:. He has a chance to
secure lasting fame by resiening.
"Allen made a most indiscreet speech.
He was rabid for Bryan and -aid that any
man who was not for Bryan had either
been influenced by Hanna or was waiting
to he, and that he expected the influence
to be taken out of a barrel. That made
me hot. I went up into the Bryan head
quarters and for a while they heard me say
thing's that could not be misconstrued.
Alien tried to explain.
"When we saw by the choice of Allen as
chairman that Bryan had a full lead, then
the middle-of-the-road men crystallized as
against Sewall and made the fight for tbe
unity of the party on that ground and
won.
"The genuine Populist in the South
hates the Democratic party as thoroughly
as the Populist in the West hates the Re
publican party. I saw big men there
pleading with tears not to be handed over
to the party of bulldozing and bailot-box
stuffing.
"All reports to the contrary," continued
Colonel Rogers, ''the convention was com
posed of as representative a body of men
as I ever saw gathered together. Out of
the 1400 men on the floor I venture to say
that there were not fifty who could not
claim the United States as their birth
place. Some corresDondents tried to rep
resent it as a noisy mob. It was quite the
reverse."

N. G. (.'., will go into camp at Los Gatos.
Eight days will be spent on the tented
field, which wiil be known as Camp City
Guard.
'Nearly every year since its organization
tbe City Guard has gone into camp â some
times with the brigade, sometimes witn
the regiment, and frequently it has gone
alone, as it will do this year.
Company B's record is a long and an
honorable one. Through all reorganiza
tions and consolidations it has maintained
Us integrity as one of the finest companies
in the guard. It is the oldest in years,
the laigest in numbers, and it has some
of the best shots in the militia.
It.is an offshoot of tne First California
Guard, which was organized July 27, 1849.
It was first known as the San Francisco
City Guard, and this, on March 31, 1854,
became the Independent City Guard. On
March 11, 1859, the company was reor
ganized as the City Guard, ana it was
again attached to the State militia, from
which it had been separated as an inde
pendent company for five years. It was
then attached to the Second Division of
the Second Brigade of the California State
militia.
Soon after the first officers of the City
Guard were elected the "First Battalion"
was formed, a battalion composed of in
fantry, cavalry and artillery. The
lieutenant-colonel and the major of this
battalion were chosen from the City
Guard officers, Captain Doane being made
lieutenant-colonel and First Lieutenant
McKenzie majar. These consolidated
companies formed the nucleus of what
was afterward the First Regiment.
During the war the old City Guam fur
nished a large number of volunteers, and
many of them camp home high in rank
and alter winning fame and honors. It
was just at the beginning of the war, May
28, 1861, that the First Infantry Regi
ment was formed, and in this new forma
tion the City Guard became Company B.
When the troops of the Second Brigade
and Second Division were required to
come forward aud take the oatn of
allegiance to the United States Govern
ment and the State t'.ie City Guard mus
tered a larger membership than any
otber company in the militia.
The City Guard's reputation as a well
drilled and efficient military organization
has not been greater than the reputation
of its members for refinement and intelli
gence. It has always drawn to it the best
element which enters the National Guard,
and its investigating committee has al
ways been a prominent and powerful fea
ture of its recruiting system. As a conse
quence it has always been known as a
gentleman's company.
A few months asp the members and ex
members of the City Guard formed the
City Guard Club, an organization which
has added new strength to the organiza
tion by keeping alive the interest of the
old-tunei*. The officers of the ci nb nr<Â»:
Lieutenant-Colonel George R. Burdictt,
pr s.deiu; Lieuenant E. 0. Lundquisi,
vice-president ; Charles Steiger, treasurer,
and E. B. Pepper, secretary. The mem
bers of the club will go to camp, too, and
special arrangements will be made for
their reception.
There are many, however, who will once
more put on the old uniform, for part of
the time at least, in Los Gatos. They will
not be asked to work hard or to drill more
than they wish, for some of them are get
ting alone in years, but the active mem
bers of the company always welcome the
veterans, for they represent the past his
tory of the organization â thÃ memory of
what it has been in contrast to what it is
now.
Among the old members who will prob
ably go down, B(fme of them in unilorm,
are' George W. Adam, H. H. Adams,
P. A. Baldwin, 0- S. Bugbee, Dr.

A JUDGE AND A SERGEANT
Davis and Conlan Lock Horns
Over a Case in
Court.
Biffrenco of Opinion in Regard to an
Arrest Made on the Bicycle
Parade Night.
Police Judge Conlan went into Police
Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday after
noon and stated that Sergeant Davis of
the police force had sworn to a falsehood
in the case of the State aeainst Charles
Code, Nicholas Buja and James Frazier,
three men who were arrested and charged
with disturbing the peace on the night of
the big bicycle parade.
Sergeant Davis had sworn that he ar
rested defendants first for obstructing the
sidewalk, but preferred the more serious
charge later at the request of cis superior
officers'; that the second cases were
broueht before Judge Joachimsen "at
Conlan's suggestion, Conlan saying he
had enoueh of those cases and that the
other Police Court Judges ought to take
some."
Speatcing of the matter last night
Sergeant Davis said: "Judge Conlau was
hasty in saying I swore falsely. He has
acted that way with people before. He
did positiveh Suggest several times that I
take the "other cases before Judge
Joachimsen, as he had enough of them.
Judge Conlan did not try the cases that
were in his court; did not swear a witness,
but took the bit in his mouth and let tbe
defendants goon statements made by them
vrhen they were not under oath. I stick to
my story. If Judge Conian says iie did
not suggest that I tafce the other cases
elsewhere he himself tells a falsehood.
"Judge Joachimsen took the view that
the defendants ought to have been fined
for obstructing the streets, an<Â« so de
clared from the bench, but he let them go
on tht* other charge of disturbing the
peace, sayine that he thought they had
been punished enougn by the arrest and
imprisonment to which they had already
been suDjected." _
The Garment-Worker*.
At a meeting of the United Garment-workers
Thursday night the following resolution was
unanimously adopted:
Jtaolved, That after this meeting any con
tractor wishing to join this labor uniou must
also bring Id nil employes. Both male and
female apprentices having served six months

VAN BUSKIRK
WHIPPED DAVIS.
A Short and Savage Fight
at the Olympic
Club.
ROCHETTE BEAT BUI LER
Green and Me Arthur Boxed Four
Pretty Exhibition
Rounds.
A BIG CROWD WAS PRESENT.
Bantam Danny Mahoney Was Not
Able to Best Frank Smith,
a New Fighter.
The lover of boxing who attended the
Olympic Club exhibition last evening got
any kind of a fight he wanted. There
were bloody fights and clever fights, and
long-range fights, and to wind up a knock
out complete and sudden enough to satisfy
tbe most fastidious lover of hard-hitting.
The gymnasium of the club's Post-street
headquarters was crowded, wlien Jim Cor
bett walked in about 8:30 o'clock and took
his seat amid a round of cheers.
Faces that have not been seen about a
ring for years were there, and all seemed
to enjoy the sport.
It is remarkable that of the eight men
who took part in the bouts five were mem
bers of the club and two made their debut
as professional boxers.
H. G. Builer of the Olympic Club and
Charles Rochette, tiie well-known light
weight, were the first pair of boxers in the
ring, both being in good condition, with
Butler two pounds the heaviest at 135.
Al King refereed the bout, which was
eight rounds.
After a moment spent in measuring
each other, Rocbette rushed in and deliv
ered a right swing Â«tbat reached Butler's
temple, bringing a thin stream of blood.
For the rest of the round Rochette fol
lowed his man cautiously about tbe ring,
getting in a good let during one rally
with ut a return.
Butler triea rushing and clinching tac
tics in the second round, evincing a lack
of inclination to break away, but Rochette
met him at his own game, and bad much
the best of the rallies. Butler was rattled.
Toward the end of the round he stopped a
bard right swing with his eye.
Butler fought foully in a clinch in the
third round and dazed Rochette with a
swing. Then he held Rochette and
punched him, with tUe referee looking on.
The police were compelled to interfere to
prevent the bout from becoming a bloody
encounter, such as has recently brought
odium on the sport.
A long wrangle between the police and
the referee stopped the fight long enough
to give Rochette a chance to recover and
he gave Butler the worst of the succeeding
rallies.
In the fourth the fighting was savage,
both getting hard swings and both going
groggy. Rochette's lexv eye showed signs
oi closing.
The next two rounfls were slugging
maicbes from the word go. Both were
covered with blood and .weak, but they
fought on trying for a knockout.
In the seventh round Rocbetie had his
opponent all but out and chased him
about the ring, bitting him at will, though
not strong enough to put iiisn down.
The last round was the hottest of all.
Rochette pouti'led Butler all about the
ring, but the Jat'.er came up gamely for
his medicine. He was staggering weakly
up to Rochette when the gong sounded.
He was terribly punished, his whole face
being swelled, while, with the exception
of a cut over his eye, Rochette w*s unin
jured. The decision iv favor of Rochette
was a popular"one.
Frank Smith, another O'.ympic Club
boy, went on for eight rounds with Danny
Mahoney. Smith weighed 115 and Ma
honey 113. Al Kin? again acted as ref
eree. Both looked to be well tra.nea and
â¢got down to business &3 soon as the gong
sounded. Smith was the most aggressive,
but his blows ali'feil short, while one of
Mahoney's old-time ritrht swings con
nected hard with Smith's neck.
Tbe second round was slow. Smith gain
ing more confidence but failing to land
effective blows. Mahoney remained on
the defensive.
In the t ird round' Mahoney lanaed a
couple of light lefts that did no great
damage and just missed a right that
would have floored him had it landed.
Tbe fourth round was slow, each waiting
for the other to attack.
The filth round was a little more lively,
some good exchanges taking place, in
which Mahoney had a shade tbe best of it.
Both showed bad temper in a clinch, aud
then to explain that it was only moment
ary, snook hands in the center of the
ring.
A .owing on Mahoney's chin in the early
part of the sixth round, made him see
stars, and Smith had the best of the
round, Danny fighting for time.
Mahoney bad a shale the worst of the
seventh, though a hard right swing cut
Smith's eye open and sent the blood
coursing down His chest. Smith was the
most aggressive and he tried nard to land
a knock-out in tbe last i^ound, but Maho
ney's left kept him away. The Olympic
Club man was given the decision on his
aggressive work.
The third event was the Green-McArthur
four-round boat, in which Manager Ken
nedy announced that there would be
neither referee nor decision.
It was evident when the men went to
work that they were not there to hurt each
other, and the blows, while some of them
were stiff, did no great harm. The crowd
evidently saw that ihe bout was simDly an
exhibition and failed to get up enthusiasm
enough to yell. The boxers put more
steam in their blows in tbe third round,
and the crowd began 10 applaud. Both
landed stiff blows on ribs and jaws, McAr

The last round was hot. Green punching
McArthar hard and sending him home
jnst a bit groggy. The cordial hand-shake
at the finish made the crowd laugh, and
the exhibition was voted the best seen at
the Olympic Club in years.
Jack Davis and G. Van Buskirfc were the
active participants in the last boat, which
was scheduled for eight rousids.
Davis weighed 175 and his opDonent 185,
and botli showed up in good condition.
Corbett refereed the bout, which was des
tined to be of short duration. Unfortun
ate old Jack Davis, after making a good
showing in the opening rallies, went out
because of his total inability to stand a
punch â not but what he is game, for be
is always that, but because of the fact that
his nervous system all goes to pieces when
ne gets a hard blow. He hit \an Buskirk
repeatedly with tbe left in tbe opening
round, but was Knocked grogey jnst before
the gong sounded, the call of time saving
him.
In the second be came to the scratch ap
parently strong, but in the first rally a
blow on the cheek sent him reeling, and a
right swing on the neck sent him down.
His head struck the floor with a resound
ing whack that could be heard all over the
ball, and it was fully five minutes before
he came to.
DEMENTI'S SAD WAIL.
He Had Only a Nickel to Pay the Costa
in a Justice Court Action.
J. Dementi, a bootblack, who has a
grievance against the Market-Street Rail
way Company, created a great deal of
amusement in Justice Barry's court yes
terday by his description of the events of
which he complains. â¢
On May 18 last, while the company still
had its obnoxious transfer check system in
operation. Dementi received a check from
a Powell-street car conductor and boarded
a car going out Market street. Something,
Dementi never found out what, was wrong
with the transfer, and he was ejected. He
brought suit in the Justice Court for $299
damages.
Yesterday, when he was asked to put up
the cost of the action, in order to insure its
being carried on, he exhibited a solitary
nickel as his capital, and said that his
bootblacking business had been bad all
day, and that the coin represented his re
ceipts. He was given time to get tbe
money together. â¢

THINK of the happiness, the

that settles upon your mind
when you say to yourself "I am j
strong and manly <;[ I have pre- 1
served the gift of manhood that i
nature gave me." Yes, you .who j
can say that, and say it honestly,
think of how much you owe to
nature, the giver of; manhood.
Yet not many can say it. There
are too many pitfalls, too many

The arrow flies with wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath It, If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "high" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accomuanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually . preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coas , and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "l'w" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in he vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmei
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK, N. V., July 31.â Speculation at

course was in the main firm. At the start the
market was weak on London selling and prices de
clined Vs@3i per cent, outside of Manhattan,
which fell nearly 2 per cent to 87Vi on the revival
of the old stories of poor tradings ana reduced divi
dends- The pressure to sell the general list was
.not pronounced by any means and after 1 o'clock
the market gradually assumed a firmer tone. The
change was due | almost entirely to a sudden rise

and was In iiris^ demand, especially in the after
noon trading. â¢

spicuous buyers, and it was common report that
the stock sold for inside account in the neighbor

lowered Wall-street : interests were for another
bull campaign. The advance ol Vs per cent In re
fined was considered corroborative evidence by
the professionals who bought the stock that the
advance will not be opposed by. insiders. Ihe
jump in the certificates strengthened the general
market, and higher prices were recorded for all
the leading issues. - .. . : . â  â  . .

CHICAGO MARKETS. o
CHICAGO, Im.. July ' 31.â A slight Improve
ment In price took place in wheat, the opening to
day being a shade below yesterday, subsequent to
which a further moderate gain was recorded. The
trade after the starting activity dwindled Into
nothingness, even the local professionals i taking
scarely any part : in the operations. ' . During the
morning St. Louts quoted an advance of aoout lc,
probably caused by rain predictions, and our mar
ket Imbibed strength through sympathy. Liver
pool was quiet and steady, and because the weak
ness of yesterday was not reflected there was the
main reason for strength at the opening. The re
ceipts were moderate. Chicago < having 167 cars
and tbe Northwest 270. Last : Friday Minne
apolis and Duluth had Â£76 cars and a year ago but
64. Local Inspections from store were 160,000
bushels. ' â¢ ,
Closing Paris cables were 5 centimes lower to 10
centimes higher for flour and 35 centimes lower to
15 centimes higher for wheat. Antwerp whs 12%
centimes lower, to unchanged, and Berlin showed a
decline of % mark. During the last hour early
buyers, finding no further encouragement, turned
sellers, and tbe entire early gain - was eliminated.
Export clearances amounted to 360,398 bushels.
Another, rally took place | in the last lifieen min
utes, shorts becoming alarmed at a scarcity of
offerings and running the market up on them
selves. September wheat opened from 58% cto
653/ ( c, sold between 58i4@583/Â»c and 1 69% c, clos
ing at 68% c bid, 8/ @i/gc higher than ' yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow 165 cars. â¢ ,
CORNâ receipts of corn this morning ex
ceeded even the liberal estimate- made yesterday
by 45 cars, 1201 cars coming in. In deference 10
this fact the price of corn at the opening was lower
than at the close yesterday. ThÂ» strength of wheat
conveyed a steadier feeling, however, and the
openlnz depreciation was later on recovered. . Tbe
withdrawals from store were goo J at ,: 365,167
bushels. Liverpool cables were . i/i'i lower. - Ex
port clearances amounted to 6b,930 bushels.
When wheat declined late in the afternoon, corn
also weakened and receded, but rallied with the
final strength of the leading, grain. â - September
corn opened at 24Vic, advanced to 25c, closed at
24%<5bid, y 8 @i4c higher than yesterday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow, 1058 cars.
â Were not active, but- they were pos
sessed of the usual steadiness. They did not de
cline with the force of corn early, nor did they ad
vance with any decree of vigor. The tone was
apparently Independent of . action of the : other
grains. Receipts were 235 cars, and 1035 bushels
were taken from store. Export clearances were
177,491 bushels. September oats .; closed â  i /8 c
higher than yesterday. . â  Estimated receipts for to
morrow 3-^6 cars. . â - .. '"y .
FLAXâ Was firm. Cash, 73c; c September, 72^40;
October. 7414 c. Receipts were 24 cars. . ; .;
. PRO VISION The run of hogs this morning
was quite light, prices at the yards recovering
for that reason. Provision traders were willing
to look at the situation with something more of
confidence than lately, and as ' shorts * were ; not
averse to securing profits tbe tone of the market
was decidedly better. September pork closed 12% c
higher than yesterday; September lard and ribs
each 5@7%c higher. . ; . â¢ â¢
BUTTERâ The butter market was firm, espe
cially for fancy makes , which were rather scarce.

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
_^ NEW YORK, N. V., July 31.â R.G.' Dun <k Co.
will say to-morrow in their weekly review of trade: ,
Business \; conditions < v have v ; clearly ;i improved,
though business ' has not. It Is the torpid season
'and better â  prospects * have ; little : effect yet. :-v Gold
exports have been stopped and foreign advices are
promising an early . and large demand ;;[ for
American products. ; The operations of foreigners ;
In the stocK market "< have '. reflected i little beyond
the troubles of speculators at â  the ; London settle
ments and varying degrees of ' ignorance about
American affairs. The prospect for large crops of
cotton , and corn â  is : still . excellent, ; and neither
movement of wheat nor mantels give , promise of
continuance to low estimates." * ,
- Wheat is going out with "freedom that is usual
and Atlantic exports have becnjl, 9ol,ll9 bushes.
flour included, for 1 the week 1 against : 900,248 last I
year, ana tor four weeks 6.364,266 bushels against
3,422,321 last year.' ; - Lower rail rates helped - corn
to make a new low record at 30.12 cents, aDd pros
pects are generally favorable. I Cotton advanced a
quarter of a cent on : reports of injury, but there
are really few who expect less than a large yield. -
'. Several weeks of Â« extremely slack . : demand for
cotton goods have brought further reduction in
print cloths to 2.44 c. ; . .;.
, The woolen - mills do not gain, light weights
offerlag 5 to 7% per cent lower in price than last
year,Jnnd sales of wool now reported are less than
a quarter of a full week's consumption. - The boot
and shoe Industry secured slight further advances
from the lowest point, bat new orders are scant.
Leather is stubbornly held, without change -, In
prices. 'â  .â -â ';â .. .-...,â â â¢â  â ': :';,w*.' :
- Hides have turned downward sharply at Chi
cago, declining 5 per cent for ; the week, with
heavy accumulations. " ; -' 'â¢ .:-â¢"â â  â¢
. The iron industry is helped but little by the se.tr
tlement which gives pnddlers of the .Ohio region
60 cents advance In wages, because the demand is
so light that few mills can . run. Many contracts
for structural work are being held back, and there
Is very little done in that line. â . . * >"."'' "â â â 
The volume of domestic trade, Judging from ex
changes, has bean small even for mtdsumm r. - It
is not surprising that failures have been consider- |
able in magnitude, and . in twenty-three days of
July defaulted liabilities were? 12,069,481. against
98,392.727 in twenty-five days lasiyear. Failures
for the week have been 281 in the United States,
against -61 last year, and '40 in Canada, against 28
last year. ju_â lâ â * '

For two years the ' Prune market, local dealers
say, has been deliberately broken at j the opening
by unscrupulous ', ' operators â  . for : purposes of
speculation."' The same thing Is being done this
year, as the four sizes are being offered at 3c f. o.
b. for New York. Local dealers consider this a
trick to depress prices â so that green Prunes may
be bought low. ' If this , Is the case It is outrageous
and means a loss of hundreds: of thousands of dol- I
lars to Prune-growers, who â¢ ought to investigate ! '
the matter. Local dealers say that as the market
Is to-day Prunes would bring 4c as readily as 80, .:-.

THE TRADEMARK
AS A PROTECTOR
Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Scheme in
Practice.
A BOON TO THE STATE.
Julian Sonntag Says It Will
Stimulate Our Exporta
tion.
13 A CHECK AT BOTH ENDS.
The Dishonest Dealer, Whether Here
or in the East, Will Meet His
Waterloo.
According to Julian Sonntag, president
of the .Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation, the trademark lately adopted
by that organization will prove a remedy
entirely efficacious in protecting Cali
fornian industry,, and will be the lever to
raise our exports to the prominence they
intrinsically deserve.
More especially will this label, assist in
patting Californian fruit where it properly
belongs in Eastern markets.
"I have been informed^" said Mx. SODn
tae yesterday, "that certain Baltimore
firms intend to put peaches on fie market,
as well as other fruits, and label them as
coming from California. This fruit is of
inferior quality, and is picked up in the
Central and Middle Eastern Slates, and if
this thing be allowed it will greatly injure
the demand for Californian production.
"Before the association adopted this
trademark we were wholly unguarded in
an event of this kind, but now we can
and will make it very uncomfortable for
these firms if they carry out their inten
tion. We will prosecute these people to
the full extent of the law.
"The Manufacturers' and Producers'Ae
eociation will act in harmony with the
Fruit Exchange and endeavor to prevent
this attempt to injure our industries. If
every packer and producer belonging to
the association will use the trademark
there can be no damage done whatever in
the East by Eastern firms.
"The association is incorporated under
the laws of the State and is registered and
compels its members to put their names
and addresses under the trademark, where
used. It further prohibits any producer
01 packer putting unmerchantable or un
healthful goods on' the market an"d retains
the right of canceling the contract entered
into between them and the association
"It is my firm belief that this plan will
do more good to California eiDortation
than anything that has been devised yet.
It will prevent not only inferior goods in
the market from Eastern dealers repre
sented as coming from here, but will also
prevent dishonest shippers here from in
juring the trade, because if they use the
trademark their goods must be of tlie best
grade. California has been cheated out of
a rightful income long enough by the ne
farious system practiced both here and in
the East, but this I think will effec'ually
put a quietus upon it. 1 shall make this a
personal matter and see that the trade
mark gets ail the use and credit it
deserves." :

P.B.CORNWALL WANTED BY THE GRAND JURY
Departure of the Expected
Witness on a Trip
North.
TO RETURN NEXT WEEK
Subpena Issued for Him to
Appear on Friday,
August 7.
UPON ILLEGAL REGISTRATION.
Registrar Hinton to Receive As*
sistance in Exposing Frauds in
His Department
Thursday last a subpena was issued for
P. B. Cornwall, president of the Mutual
Electric Light Company, to attend a ses
eioa of the Grand Jury yesterday. The
document demanding Mr. Cornwall's
presence as a witness was placed in tbe
bands of Detective Robert Hogan at the
District Attorney's office for service. It
P. B. Cornwall, Who Has Been Subpenac-d by the Grand Jury to Tell What He
Knows About the Bribing of Supervisors.
was ascertained Thursday afternoon that
Mr. Cornwall started for the State of
Washington the evening previous.
Yesterday. the Grand Jury, through Dis
trict.Attorney Barnes, directed that an
other subpena should issue for Mr. Corn
wall to appear before tbe Grand Jury Fri
day, August 7. It is understood that Mr.
Cornwall will have returned from the
north by tnat time.
The failure of Mr. Cornwall to appear
oefore tne Grand Jury yesterday caused a
little quiet rejoicing among the solid
seven Supervisors and their friends. It
was Known tnat the Grand Jury expected
some important revelations from this
gentleman. He had not volunteered to
testify but was accredited with the state
ment that if the Grand Jury called on
him to tell what he knew concerning the
methods of certain members of the Board
-of Supervisors he would tell it.
Thursday night the accused seven re
ceived a hint that Mr. Cornwall had left
tbe City, and the hinted, intelligence
caused a feeling x>i relief. When Mr.
Cornwall went before the Wallace Grand
Jury some years ago and told how a cor
poration furnishing light had been com
pelled to put vi) money in lÂ«rge sums for
protection, the chief boodlers made a gen
eral break for cover. Mr. Cornwall is sup
posed to know something of the mysterious
methods employed to tap the corpora
tions, and may also know something of
the companies that are willing to be
tapped.
The members of the Grand Jury are con
fident that Mr. Cornwall will be in San
Francisco again by August 7. They have
received information to theeffefct that he
can throw some light on several transac
tions. If he remains absent a long time
the jury will remain in session a long
time. . . . " -.
Supervisor Dimond was a witness before
the Grand Jury yesterday. It is not as
serted that his testimony was impprtant.
He is reported to have testified that he
did not, of his own Knowledee, know that
Supervisors had been bribed" or influenced.
He had formed an opinion by general ob
servation â an opinion which many others
had formed. As he did not train with tne
accused Supervisors he did not know their
secrets, ' They did not tell him of their
plans. He was not yi fheir confidence and
knew nothing of their purposes beyond
what their votes disclosed.
The subject of illegal registration- en
gaged the. attention of the Grand Jury
and District Attorney Barnes for quite a
long time yesterday afternoon. Three
communications bearing on the matter
from Registrar Hinton were considered,
and it w.as resolved to sustain that officer
in his efforts to prev^u, fraud and illegal
voting. In order to act with a, clear and
definite purpose it was arranged that
Registrar Hinton and District Attorney .
Barnes should hold a conference next
Monday. The Registrar will then present
all the important facts in his possession

Speaking f" r 'h Grand Jury Frank F.
McLeimai , the seer tarv, said: "We shall

our power towaru cringing to puhisnment
persons guilty of illegal registration."
Registrar Hinton was seen after the ad
journmentof the Grand Jury. He said:
"One of the cases referred to the Grand
Jury was sent there by diitectien of the
Election Commissioners. Two more cases
were referred. My purpose is to get the
Grand Jury to make an example of per
sons seeking to falsely register. One case
clearly involving perjury was laid before
the jury. We had a oase like this, for
exaiuphe: A man registered, .giving his
residence at a certain number in tha 900
block on Vallejo street.
Inquiry established ihe fact that.he lived
there and was entitled to vote. Subse
quently he went' into another district,
rented a room in a lodging-house, regis
tered on the house book, was assigned to
a room and secured the key to his apart
ment. Then be came to this office with
an application to be appointed to serve on
the precinct board of the precinct in which
that lodging-house is situated. In making
this application he swears that he is a resi
dent of the precinct.
"I do not feel at liberty," said Registrar
Hinton, "to say what I have communi
cated to the Grand Jury, but the purpose
is to punish persons guilty of perjury in
connection with registration."
The Grand Jury yesterday went into
Judge Hebbard's court and presented an
indictment against James Hughes and
Patrick Hughes for resisting an officer.
According to the papers in the case re
sistance was offered on June 13, and the
police officers then resistedâ¢ were David
iÂ£oegel and J. N. Beach. These officers,
together with Sergeant F. S. Davis and D.
J. Drisooll, were the : witnesses heard by
the Grand Jury. Koegel and -Beach ware
arresting Mark Hefferan on the charge of
grand larceny, -when Patrick and James
Hughes locked the door and made a loud
talk, with threats of using a, knife. : ; No
incisions with the knife were made, hence
no blood was shed, but the- matter was
getting very serious when- assisting police
men forced the doors and completed the

CORNWALL MAY TALK.
Mr. Summerhayes Says That the
Jury Can Learn Much About
Street Lighting. â¢
William R. Summer fiayes, vice-presi
dent and general manager of the Mutual
Electric Light Company, was found last
evening at hia home at 709 Oak street. '
"I do not know what Mr. Cornwall may
testify to before the Grand Jury,"- lie said.
"He has -been, in a position to know all
about- the ins an.d outs of street lighting
in â¢ San Francisco. He was president of
the California Electric Lighting Company,
then president ot the Edison Electric
Light and Power Company, and now, he is
with, the Miltual Electric Light Company.
' "So far as 1 know no one has come from
the Board of Supervisors to get money
out of pur company. .No, I understand
that the first stage 1 is to subject the cor
poration on the outside to annoyance and
to hamper it all that is <â  possible. We are
eoinÃ through that stage now.. â¢ .
"We did not put up 1 cent for thp Super
visors nor will we put up any money for
them. Neither will we be crowded out of
existence. We knew that it would not be
possible for us to get a franchise from the
Supervisors, and so we are working under,
the State constitution. I â¢wiil tell you
our experience and you can 'judge what
the attitude of. the Supervisors is toward
a -corporation which affords competition
to the Edison Company.
. "The Supervisors are supposed to repre
sent the people.' If they do so they surely
ought to stand in with any competition
wfrich will reduce rates for lignts. When
we put up poles in front of the Baldwin,
on the Powt'.ll-sireet side, we asked for the
privilege of establishing, lights there.
The Supervisors granted us that privilege,
but twenty-four hours later the privilege
was rescinded.
"We. were- ordered by Street Superin
tendent Ashworth. who is a stockholder
in the Edison Company, to take down our
poles. We refused to do that, and a scrim
mage took place. Mr. Ashworth told me
that he would arrest any one who at
tempted to put" up lights on those poles,
and some arrests we c made. .Mr. Ash
worth said that he would not permit the
poles to stand, and when I asked him why
he said that the. Supervisors were pushing
him and the Edison Company was push
ing the Supervisors.
"I sent our solicitor to the members of
the Street Committee of - the Supervisors,
Messrs.* Benjamin, Dunker and Hughes, to
ask why we could not keep our poles
standing. They all said that if the Bald
win Hotel people wanted tbe poles up
they could bave them there, but that tbe
Mutual Electric Light Con,panv coula not
supply light to the -Baldwin The reason
given for this by each of the three men
named was that the Edison Company was
pushing them so. The solicitor is named
R. Mills. He has made affidavit to this
before a notary. A member of the Mer
chants' Association called upon 'us con
cerning the street lighting.
"The San Francisco Gas Light Company
and the Edison Confpany have combined.
The combination was talked up before the
contracts for street lighting were awarded.
The Edison Company is obliging the City
to pay 55 cents a night per light more
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, AUGUST 1, 1896.
than private parties pay. The rate to the
City per week, on the average is $3 85.
The Harbor Light and Power Comparjy,
which is really the Ediso.n company under
a convenientalia^, charges citizens $3 a
week for twelve hours' lighting per night,
while the City lights burn only ten hours
a night. The City does not get the same
candle-power that is furnished to private
citizens. The City gets iess than do the
citizens. ,
"We put in no bid for lighting tbe
streets. It would have done us no good.
It looks strange that the contract was
made for the term of two years, when it is
a well-known fact that machinery will
steadily decrease the cost of producing
electric light, as new machines are con
tinually being invented. We have no
privileges granted to us. We nave been
assessed $50,000 for our franchise, and we
have no trancnise, but are working under
the State constitution, as I Ijave already
said. Assessor Siebe has told two men
â¢that he was urged to make the assessment
against our franchise $100,000. The Super
visors, sittiag as equalizers, would eive us
no relief. There is some one behind the
Supervisors pushing them on. Tnere can
be no question concerning that.

eight days. I have, no doubt that he will
be able* to interest tbe grand jurors."

Visitors. ;
On the official map of. San Francisco
Van Ness avenue has its northern termin
ation at a point opposite the extreme end
of Fort Mason. Now the ; : broad ; avenue
comes to an â¢ abrupt â¢ stop ' three or ' four
blocks nearer to town. ' .If has been fenced
and pedestrians may not .pass the barrier
without the assistance of .ladders ana at
the imminent peril .of . becomming eh
tangled in various strands of â  barbed wfre.
The fence was . almost completed yester
day across Van Ness avenue. It is a sub
stantial affair with supports sunk far down
into the soil and a stout framework lor the
boarding. The boards themselves go be
low the level of ; the ground, so that no
body may bore beneath and so defeat the
purpose of * the barricade, and they . artf
carried upward fully eignt, feet. Above
them the sustaining posts are continued a
distance of feur'or live feet. The object of
this additional height of railing is to make
provision for strands of barbed : wire that
are to be placed close together with a view
of making an impassable blockade.
. Permission was given by the Board of
Supervisors to .Captain "Vogdes, :in com
mand of ; the Government station at Fort
Mason, to erect and maintain the fence on â¢
Van Ness, avenue last Monday," and' im
mediately thereafter lumbe â  .was hauled
to : the spot 'where the fence no stands. >
Next day a force of i workmen from Fort
Mason put in an appearance. Some spent
the : day , sinking - deep boles in the hard
earth, others made measurements and cut
up the timber in suitable lengths, and just
as ; the preliminary .. work f .was -: finished
actual construction-, began. In. two days
the fence was â¢ up and the picturesque ap
proach along Van Ness avenue, 'over hum
mocks of sand and ; through a ; tangle of
sweet ; shrubs and : flowers that have scat
tered themselves along, the . way from the
. Fort Mason gardens, was closed. All that
now .remains to make the fence absolutely
impassable , is ;to affix the wire ? topping
after the fashion of the Midwinter Fair
boarding. . \ \ â¢ r;^-'
; "The obstruction is placed on the avenue
close to the crossing of North Point street,
on which the abandoned woolen mil la are
built. , It runs clear from r the west wall of
the mills, 'following .' the contour of .; the
ground, till it *â¢ meets the Government res
ervation fence. .On the north or bay side,
where t,he ungraded avenue â¢ drops down
.ward to the shore, there is a wild bit of
scenery -that seems to have its greatest at
traction in the contrast with City streets a
block or two away. It used '< to afford an
interesting walk -v to the shore, and was
largely taKen* advantage" â¢ of , ? for fat " the

quite recently erected.a handsome club

door has '. been â ' put) in \ the fence to allow
the Dolphins arid their friends to pass
through. â¢ This door will have a latch lock
similar to the lock ,on : the clubhouse,'; so
only. members of the rowing club r can ?go
beyond the barrier. ; They are now talking
of building a walk all the way to the club
house that will be a good path in all kinds

THAT JAPANESE
STEAMSHIP LINE
Important Conference at
the Chamber of
â¢; . Commerce.
THE OUTLOOK BRIGHT.
Reasons Why the Southern Pa
cific Might Not Oppose the
v â¢ New Line.
WOULD LOSE THE LAND SAUL.
W. B. Curtis Says a Belt- Line -Ex
tension Would Be an Induce
ment to 80th...
An executive conference . between the
trustees of the Chamber of Commerce and
the Japanese representatives of the Toyo
Kisen Kobusbiki Kaisha, otherwise the
Japanese steamship line, now in the City
for the special purpose of seeing what the
advantages of San Francisco for making
it^the American terminus of the line are,
was held in the â¬hamber of" Commerce
yesterday afternoon.
The Japanese officials of the line pres
ent were: President Soishira Oseho, Cap
tain Shujiro Tomicka, Dkector Hiro Ko
bayashi "and Director H. Okawa, who
acted as. interpreter. Though slightly
tedious owing to the necessity of an inter
preter, the conference was quite agreeable
to all participating. The conference con
tinued over an hoar.
The trustees expressed their wUlingness
and desire to appoint committees to act
witn the Japanese in the matter of wharf,
railroad and other facilities. The
Japanese expressed appreciation of the
offer, and will in all probability take ad
vantage of it when they return to the City.
The party will next visit San Diego, and
return to this City'in the course of a week
or ten days.
As the party was leaving the chamber
President Hugh Craig of the chamber said
to President Osano and the others of his
party: "We would like you to understand
that whatever you want we will get it for
you."
When this was translated to them by
the interpreter the party bowed, smiled,
looked pleased and after a few minutes of
further conversation in the secretary's
office, they withdrew.
A serious obstacle that the Japanese
officials s^era to think they will meet
here is that they would not be able
to make the necessary railroad coDnec
tions for transporting the cargoes of their
ships east, owing to the connection be
tween the Pacific Mail and the Southern
Pacific.
In speaking on this and othÂ». points
afterward, Captain Merry of the chamber
said :"We assured them wharf facilities,
and there is- no doubt that we can carry it
out. We are going to co-operate with
them to the extent of onr ability. We
want this steamship line and Ido not see
any serious objection so far as facilities are
concerned wuy we should not have it.

nese officials were informed that we would
appoint committees to confer with them
anfi the Southern Pacific. That railroad"
would lose the land haul if it refused to
make satisfactory transportation arrange
ments with the new line. If the Japa
nese steamship line went north to Tacoma
or Seattle the Northern Pacific or Great
Northern railroads would get the addi
tional business." â¢
"Do you think San Francisco will be the
terminus?"
"Yes, I thing so. I do not see why it
should not."
*W. B. Curtis, manager of the Traffic
Association, who arrived at the meeting
just as it broke up, said be did not think
the Southern Pacific would oppose the
Japanese steamship line. He said that if
the Southern Pacific were permitted to
extend its belt line from its present ter
minus at the Pacific Mail dock to the foot
of Steuart street it would give it addi
tional facilities for the handling of ocean
commerce. This, he thought, would be an
inducement to the Japanese steamship
line and a greater inducement to the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company.
DRAGGED FROM A CAR.
W. . M. . PurcelJ, After Paying
His Fare, Is Refused a
Ride.
He Will Begin an Action for Dam
ages Against the Railroad
Company.
Yesterday evening, about 6 o'clock, Wil
liam M. Purcell, "a boot and shoe agent,
having an office in the Spreckels building
on Market street, was dragged off a McAl
lister-street car by several conductors and
gripmen, undtjr peculiar circumstances.
According'to Mr. Purcell's statement be
boarded the 'car in front of his place of
business,, and being unable to get inside or
even on the. dummy or platform because
of the great crowd of passengers, be stood
on a rear step. The conductor took his
fare, and after -having run g it in ordered
Purcell to get off the step. Being unable
to get a foothold on the platform, the pas
senger did not move.
At the intersection of Market and Mc-
Allister streets the car was stopped and
the conductor,-with the assistance of the
gripman, forced Purcell off. When the
car started he climbed on and again it was
stopped and the passenger thrown off. By
this time several cars and a large number
of people had collected. Tne latter hissed
the railroad men and called to Purcell to
resist and they would take his fight off. his
hands ; but he did not wish to precipitate
an assault on the conductor and gripman
by the crowd and only tried to keep hid
place on the car.
As the car employes could not get rid of
the passenger pluckily making his tight
alone against several burly fellows, they
concluded to run up to the City Hall and
call the police. They did so, and two
officers came out from the Central station.
Purcell was still standing on the step,
and when the policemen learned that he
had paid his fare they refused to arrest
him or interfere in any manner.
Then gripman King, No. 241, stepped off
of car 263, and being a large strong man
violently dragged Purcell off the car and
held him until it bad gotton some.dis
tance away. Purcell asked the police offi
cers to arrest the gripman, but they re
fused. Several gentlemen who were on
the car and witnessed the entire proceed
ing offered their cards to Pnrcell and re
quested him to call them as witnesses.
Among them were Dr. Prank Barrett, 1324
Golden Gate avenue; F. McCarthy, 7 Bai

and Â£. Benedict, 205 Larkin street.
Lieutenant Birdsell of the Central police
station stated that the officers did not in
