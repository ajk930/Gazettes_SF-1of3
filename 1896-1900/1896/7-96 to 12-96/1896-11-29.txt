Theory â Professor Cross, the Linguist,
Adds His Evidence.
No one has as ret identified the aerial voyager that is supposed to be displaying
the mysterious lights tf.at have shone down upon startled gazers in various parts of
..the State, bat the number of those who have seen what they are ready to swear was
an airship is constantly growing larger.
While even many of those who have seen the flitting and gleaming lights are not
prepared, to decrare they are carried by a full-fledged aerial craft they admit they can
. account in no ordinary way for the phenomenon.
.There is, therefore, yet ample room for the mystery to be proved a fake, a
hallucination or a verity. Meanwhile, and until the mystery is completely solved,

essablish.
General Hart received Â» visit yesterday from one of tbe men .I) a '.. ]
. been caking trips with the mysterious inventor in his aerial vessel. Tb<s general de
.-..dined to give any irformation of these trips. He stated, however, that this man and
mechanic in the services of the inventor had gone to the workshop of the
â¢inventor to assist in the work of completing a third and much improved craft. This
, remodeled vessel would be completed, he expected, in about a week.
It was to be a great improvement on the two airships already built, and when
. it has been properly tested was to be at once dispatched for the scene of its
deadly purpose (Havana), which was to be overwhelmed with a shower of dynamite.
Considerable time will be consumed, according to the statement of General Hart, in
making the crew who are to go on the novel expedition familiar with the working of
the vessel.
General Hart has contributed a full statement regarding his connection with the
reputed warship of tbe air and tells some new and interesting things therein in regard
to it. He also takes up the defense of the Cuban patriots in a most patriotic and
" martial spirit
Professor M. S. Cross, dean of the University of the Pacific, now adds his testimony
to that of the believers, and H;.ywards people of prominence tell some additional
startling stories.
SEEN BY PROFESSOR CROSS.
The Dean of the University of the Pacific Testifies to the Passage of
the Conqueror of the Air.
Profeisor M. S. Cross, dean of the University of the Pacific and professor of
ancient languages, is one of the best-known scholars and linguists in the United
States. He is a brother of Senator Cross of this City. He stands very high in the
estimation of all students and professors, so that his testimony on the aerial wonder
will be received with profound attention. The following telegram, giving his opinion
on the subject, was received yesterday:
Cal., Nov. 2Z -Professor M. S. CrosÂ«, dean of the University of the
PaciSc, confirms the story of tbe airship's passage over East San Jose Thursday night
Professor Cross is known in this vicinity as a careful and conservative man of unim
. iÂ»eachable veracity, and his testimony has won scores of doubting Thomases over to a
firm belief in the existence of an aerial craft in this vicinity. The fact that the head
of a Methodist representative educational institution on this coast has been fortunate
enough to view this nocturnal visitor has well nigh silenced the scoffers.
"It wan just about 7 o'clock on Thursday evening when my attention was called to
the strange light in the air," sa,d Professor Cross. "I was visiting at the residence of
r. Professor Worcester and was called into the yard by him to view the airship. Whether
or not it was an airship of course I am not prepared to say, but certain it is there was
a rapidly moving light in the heavens far too large and bright to be an electric street
light. To my eye it appeared to be about six inches in diameter. It was moving in a
â¢ southwesterly direction and apparently at a high rate of speed.
â¢The motion was not steady. It wavered and swerved, rising and falling slightly
Tbe motion, however, was not that of a balloon. I bave frequently watched balloons
in the air, and the motion of this light was in no way suggestive of the manner in
which 1 have always seen them behave. Moreover, it was a quiet night What slight
breeze there was I think was from the south. Yet this light traveled rapidly in a
southerly direction. As it left us the light seemed to broaden. This suggested to us
. that there might be two lights which an the craft swung broadside to us joined rays
'and gave the appearance of a wide streak of light."
Professor Cross is confident that it could not be either a balloon or a natural heav
"enly. body that he saw. "I will be very much surprised," he declared, "if something
more than a balloon is not found to have been floating about I see nothing very
wonderful in the construction of an airship. From experiments already made there
eeems to be every reason to hope for success in aerial navigation."
The point where Professor Cross viewed the ship is about two blocks distant from
tfhere John BawJ, whose account appeared in yesterday's Call, saw it, and the two
accounts tajly precisely in point of time, direction and general movements. The ship
kas nearer the earth when Bawl viewed it.
PASSED OVER HAYWARDS.
A Mysterious LlÃht Traced From a
Capvon of the Paiomares Valley.
OAKLAND,* Cal., Nov. 28.â The resi
dems of Haywards are convinced that the
peculiar thing, airship or something: else,
'hat they l?ave been watching pasa over
their town on numerous occasions, has its
home somewhere 'among the canyons of
Valley.
\ To-mglrt the marvelous light was olj-
rifci ved in such a manner as to forever set
aside the idea that it is a star. Two par
ties, teveral "miles apart, observed it. To
one it was to the eastward and to the
other it passed westward. When notes
were compared it was agreed that it had
passed over between the two observers.

tions unless be can back them up in
formed George Oakes, editor ot the Hav
wardÃ Journal, that he saw the airship
traveling through the heavens in the
direction of Castro Valley Wednesday
evening about 9:30 o'clock. The brilliant
lightly was plainly seen at his home and
also by other members of the family.
Fred Hoyt also saw the iight as it was
floating leisurely along in the direction of
the Liedel place, near San Lorenzo. He
was so interested in watching the moving
object and would no doubt have solved
the mystery had he not lost bis balance
and fallen into a ditch that he did not see
was in his path.
Carl Mohr furnishes the most startling
information. He told Mr. Oakes that he
Viewing the Mysterious Aerial Lights From the Dome of the State CapitoL
saw the airship rise from a canyon near '
his place Thursday evening about 7 o'clock j
and proceed in the direction of San Fran
cisco, and also saw it return. Mr. Mohr
is very positive in his statement, and I
firmly believes that the machine is being
housed near Lone Tree Cemetery.
About the clearest statement yÂ«t made
regarding the mysterious airship comes
from C. S. Long, C. W. Everett and H.
Liedel, three of the best-known citizens of
Haywards, who were crosÂ«inz tne railroad
track at the depot in a buggy Tuesday
evening, about 6:30 o'clock, when their
attention was attracted to an exceedingly
bright light in the direction of the bay
and they watched it for some time. lit
wa3 moving very rapidly, and while they
could not swear that it was an airship
they do not hesitate to say that it com
pletely puzzled them.
"I was going home about 7 o'clock,"
9aid Mr. Hooson, "when I met my
brother, who called my attention to a re
markable light in the heavens. At the
first glance I could see it was a powerful
electric light. It was slightly south of
east and was moving steadily across the
country toward the bay. I have not been
a belisver in the published accounts of air
ships, but must now say that I have seen
something that was not natural to the
skies.
"The light was not a steady light like a
star, but flickered like our arc lights here
on the streets, and It looked like one of
them some distance away. One peculiar
feature of the iight was the way it changed
Irom time to time.
"It appears as if the operator of a search
light was placing red and blue rlrs* before
the light occasionally so as to make the
light more noticeable to any one who
happens to be looking into tho heavens.
No star has ever done that in the past and
I am not ready to believe that one is doing
any such capers at present, lr this was
the first time the lights had been seen
here I raieht not think so much of it, but
residents have been seeing a light come
from the hills on a number of occasions
and make its way across the heavens
toward the south. It was only corrobora
tive of these to-night when I saw it"
Editor George A . Oakes was a nother who
saw the visitor to-night from his residence
in the northern part of Haywards.
"I saw the light to-night for the SrÂ«
time," said he, "and am sure it was no
star or lira balloon. It passed eastof town
and appeared to go across the bay, as if
headed for lower San Francisco. The
white light was not steady, and changed
to a red occasionally. It is more than I
can solve, and must be some one who has
finally solved the problem of aerial navi
gation."
Jesse Hooson. a student at St. Mary's
College, had a good view of the visitor at
Haywards to-night.
"I was startled," said he, "on coming
along the street to-night to see a very
bright light in the heavens. It was like
an arc electric light, and, naturally, I
stood watching it The thing was moving
toward the southwest with the wind at
first, hut changed its course several times,
and finally came up into the wind for
some distance. It dually disappeaied over
toward Redwood City. The thing seemed
to be operated by some one to see how it
would answer a helm or guiding appa
ratus of some kind."

HART'S INVENTOR HAS THREE AERIAL FLIERS.
A Full Statement Made Over the Signature of the Attorney for the
Alleged Cuban Filibuster.
In reference to the airship which has been puzzling and astonishing many of the people of Cal
ifornia I will say this :
I have not seen it personally, but have talked with the man who claims to be the inventor. I
have spent several hours with him. He has shown me drawings and diagrams of his invention and
I am convinced that they are more adapted for the purpose for which he claims them than any other
invention making such claims that I have ever seen.
It seems to me that the evidence that THE Call has been enterprising enough to collect in ref
erence to this airship, the character of the people who have seen the same, the fact that it moves
against the currents of air as well as with them, the fact that it has the power to dart from side to
side or forward, ought to convince the people that there is something in the invention
I asked the gentleman who claims to be the inventor what his desires were in regard to carry
ing on the business, and he stated that he did not desire any money ; that he didn't ask or want
any one to invest in it ; that he was not a citizen of California, and that he had come here to perfect
and test his airship as the climate and currents of air were most suitable to his purpose. He further
stated that he had progressed so far since coming to California that California certainly was en
titled to the honor of its invention, as it was in quite a crude state w,hen he first came here; that
he had two airships already constructed. One, he said, was of large size, capable of carrying three
persons, the machinery, the fixtures and 1000 pounds of additional weight, and another that was
much smaller, capable of carrying one man, the machinery, fixtures and 500 or 600 pounds of other
matter.
He also stated that he was a cousin of Mr. Linn, who was Antonio Maceo's electrician, and
that he is expected to take it to Cuba for the purpose of aiding in the capture of Havana as soon
as he could perfect it and acquaint his associates with the handling of it.
He was a man of dark complexion, dark eyed and about 5 feet 7 inches in height and
weighed about 140 pounds. He looks considerably like the gentleman playing the part oi Arion,
the aerial acrobat, but is a little taller.
He claims to have three assistants with him, all of whom are mechanics; that he uses two
kinds of power, gas and electricity; that his lights are sometimes produced by electricity and some
times by gas, with the aid of reflectors.
He claims to have moved 120 miles at one flight and in a little less than six and a
h alf hours, and at that time was not going wholly with the currents ; that he uses electricity for
propelling his vessel against the wind, and uses gas largely in going with the air currents. He does
this in order to save power.
He proposes to build another airship, and in fact one of the parties interested with him has
told me that they are now at work on the third airship, which is to be more commodious and more
perfect than the other two, and that it would be so constructed that in the event the machinery got
out of order and it should fall into the water it could be used as a boat by detaching a portion of the
airship. When this is completed and ready for use the inventor intends to leave California for
Cuba.
So far as the electrical power is concerned, the Fargo electric storage battery is of sufficient
capacity, as to power and lightness, to furnish the requisite power for aerial navigation, and the in
ventor proposes to use this power in connection with the other for his operations. The battery can
be stored to its full capacity, which is 20 horsepower, in 17 minutes.
I am of the opinion that this airship will be a success, and that its success is far more probable
at this time than the Morse telegraphy was at the time he first offered the same to the public.
So far as the public is concerned this inventor does not aslcany one to invest in the enterprise
Perhaps this may be evidence of insanity. 1 will admit that this is the first time to my knowledge
that anybody had anything in California in which he did not want anybody to invest money

DYNAMITE CONCLUDES THE
WORK OF THE BULLETS.
This Fearful Carnage Occurs in the
Rubi Hills Before Weyler
Arrives.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 28.âLieu
tenant Jose Felix Rios, a special mes
senger from the Cuban Government to the
junta in this city, arrived here last night
on the Clyde line steamer Algonquin from
Jacksonville. This afternoon he told a
startling story in the headquarters of the
Cubans in this city, which would go to
show almost beyond doubt that a battle
which took place in the Rubi Hills in
October last, and in which 2000 Spanish
soldiers are said to have been killed, had
been construed into an engagement with
Weyler's troops in the same territory
about a week ago.
The details of the October battle are
strikingly similar to th; details of the
story of Weyler's alleged engagement
which was attributed to Lieutenant Rios,
although he now denies that he ever gavo
out such an interview. He declares in
stead that what he said about the alleged
engagement wilh Weyler was simply com
mon talK in Jacksonville while he was
there a^H is story is as follows:
"I am a Galician and went to Cuba when
11 years old. For a long time I have been
in the commission business in Havana.
Having worked hard for the Cuban cause
I was some time ago appointed a lieuten
ant in the Gomez nrmy and took part la
the battle ol Ssra'ori. On October 23 last
I I was given documents by General Gomez
and by tho Cuban Governiacnt, repre
sented oy General Cisneros at a town
called Araucana, an encampment near
Cannquay.
"With eight men I left a certain part of
the island in a small boat and set a course
for Nassau. We arrived there in 5 days.
A Spanish gunboat which had been hunt
ing for us got iuto port two hours later,
but she was quarantined and we were
sale. From Nassau, after some delay, wa
went to Jacksonville, thence to this oity."
Some shrewd questioning at this point
led Lieutenant Rios off the subject of his
story and into the details of a fight that
he said occurred in tbe Rubi Hills, just
where Maceo's engagement with Weyler's
troops is said to have taken place. Ha
declared that he knew it to be an absolute
fact that the Spanish General Melquizo,
with 15,000 men, the exact number that
Maceo i 3 said to have engaged a few
wreks ago. came suddenly upon General
Maceo, with 6000 Cuban patriots behind
him. As usual the Cubans got to work
first, and before Meiquizo could got his

PRESIDENT CLEVELAND TALKS ABOUT POLITICS.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 28â An evening paper here prints an account of a conversation between President
Cleveland and a prominent Democratic politician, in which the President expressed at length his views on the future of
the Democratic party. He said tbat while a blunder was made by the leaders in the convention at Chicago he is confident
" the men responsibl z for that error will be convinced of their error and brought back into the true Democratic path, and
he is confident that the party, by repudiating at the first opportunity the declarations made at Chicago will recover much
of the ground lost in the rate campaign..
J.t is to those Democrats who followed Bryan solely on the ground of regularity and to their brethren who organized
the movement leading to tbe Indianapolis convention that Mr. Cleveland looks for the reorganization and the rehabili
tation of the Democratic party. He is confident they will not follow the free-silver myth into the Populist party, bat will
come back into the Democratic party when the partinc of the ways is reached. Probably a third of tbe votes given
Mr. Bryan, particularly in the Southern States, were cast by Democrats who were influenced in registering the ballots
exclusively by the idea of "regularity." Mr. Cleveland is said to expect that ttie radical element of tbe party, composed
. as it is of men who' enthusiastically indorse all the dangerous doctrines proclaimed at Chicago, will shortly be swallowed
â  up in the Populist organization.
It is th 9 President's idea tbat the sooner they go the better it will be for the Democratic party. He wants their
organization to be effected along the lives laid down ia the Indianapolis platform, which he regards as the embodiment of
essential Democratic principles.
The President insists that it is only to the Democratic party, purified and rejuvenated as be hopes it will be by this
sloughing off process and by accession from the ltepublican and independent voters that the people can look with any
degree of hope or confidence for relief from their burdens. He thinks the great evils which now menace the country are
the greed oi wealth and tlie rapacity of corporations. He sees ia the return of the Republican party to power no prospect
of the abatement of these evils.
line into tfhape he was greeted with a
shower of leaden bail that mowed great
gaps in his line. The battle continued
for some time before Maceo, who had evi
dently been waiting for Spain's soldiers,
bdgan slowly to retreat.
A"t this point, as in the story of the
alleged Weyler engagement, the dynamite
â¢incident conies in. Hundreds of Spanish
soldiers were killed instantly by tbe dis
charging of the dreaded substance a'most
under their feet. The carnage was terri-
ble. ' Maceo still retreated,, and was fol
lowed slowly by the broken lines of the
â¢ Spanish forces. Then from an eminence â
this same eminence is mentioned in the
' alleged Weyier engagement â Maceo
brought a dynamite gun to bear on the
Spaniards and killed off several hundreds
of Spain's soldiers before darkness ended
tbe fighting.
Maceo and his victorious troops got
away. Lieutenant Rios declared here
that the Cuban loss was only thirty. The
Spaniards, ne declares, lost nearly 2000
men.
Lieutenant Rios was then asKed if the
story dated November 26. from Jackson
ville, Fla., and purporting to be an inter
view with him, was true. He replied,
through an interpreter, that the Weyler
story he knew nothing about, but ex
plained when he was told its purport that
â¢. he had heard the same thing befoce leav
ing on the Algonquin for this city.
"Do you know whether it was true?" he
was asked.
His reply was that he knew nothing at
all about it. This seemed to settle the
story of General Weyler's engagement
. with Maceo's men in the Rubi hills, which
he declared was an untruth, and whicu
Cubans have said was a fact.
Lieutenant Rios says regarding the oc
cupancy of the province of Camaguey by
the Cubans:
"The Cuban Government is in healthy
operation in this district. The Spaniards
have given it up. I:i the mountains un
â¢ der the roois of the old farmhouses the
new Government of Cuba libre is conduct
ing schools for the children of patriots.
"The pupils range in age from 7 to 13
years, all the boys of a greater ace than
. that being engaged in the fight fcr the
island's liberty. In the provinces of
. Camaguey and Onente they have shoe
makers' shops for the benefit of the
â¢ Cuban soldiers and blacksmith shops for
tbe shoeing of the patriots' horses. A tax
is levied by the Government, but it is not
ocompulsory. T&ese provinces the Civil
Governors Mandozaand Manuel Cespedes
'a p e in charge of. A very small force of
. men is all that is necessary to protect the
people there.
He was accompanied to this city by Cap
taui Dupier and another Cuban. The doc
uments sent by Gomez and Cisneros are in
the hands of the Cuban Junta.

ST. PAUL, Mikx., Nov. 28. --The great
storm which swept over Minnesota and
the Dakotas Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday has resulted in some loss to human
life and great loss to livestock. Mail
Asent Burroughs of the Great Northern
was buried fn a snowdrift near* Devils
Lake, N. D. He was on the westbound
which was stalled on the Devils Lake
Thursday evening and walked into a res
taurant at Devils Lake, obtained as big a
supply of provisions as he could carry and
started back for his trip. He never
reached it.
A searching party has been digging In
the snow for his body all the afternoon.
John Hoey, a farmer living four miles
from Park River, N. D., started from his
house to his barn Thursday night and his
body was found two miles away on the
the prairie this afternoon.
The loss to stock is rather heavy. A
coat of ice covers the ground, and snow is
in some places pltadLln drifts twelve feet
high. On the rangc%s,*\Â«<iTM the Missouri
the worst is feared for ftuft*, as it is be
lieved it will be impossible for cattle and
sheep to get enou-.h to e^t until it thaws.
The temperature is froih 5 to 20 degrees
belov: zero in that section, and below zero
at all points in tlie Dakotas.
At Vermiliion, S. D., there is hardly a
tree standing and t>very orchard is ruined.
In many instances trews a foot in diameter
were snapped off at the bottom. Every
telegraph and telephone wire in that town
was prostrated and it will have no lights
until next week. To-night's reports from
Moosenead. Fargo, Grand Forks, Devilg
Lake and Bismarck say trains are begin
nin<r to move irregularly again.
The storm in the vicinity of Aberdeen
has not been paralleled since the great
blizzard of January 12, 1888. Drifts in the
streets of Aberdeen and on the railroad
tracks and at most South Dakota towns
are five to six feet deep. Railroad traffic
has been entirely abandoned until the
storm abates. Freight trains in Minne
sota and the Dakotas are stalled and the
Eureka accommodation is fast at Hills
View. An utter demoralisation prevails
everywhere.
At Pierre, S. D.. travel of all kinds is
completely tied. There have undoubtedly
been serious stock losses on the range*.
It will be several days before anything
definite can be learned from the cattle
country to the west of Pierre.
Huron, S. D., reports the north winds
and the snow in blinding cloud 3 blowing
fifty miles an hour, filling railway cuts
and piling in drifts as high as the house

WHEAT PRICES ADVANCE.
Reports That Cause a Great Demand and
Much Excitement in ike New
York Pit
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 28.â The
wheat market made a record for it3eif for
the year to-day by the opening of the De
cember option at 9iVÂ£. or \% points above
the closing price of yesterday. All of the
early news was of a bullish character.
The foreign cables were better, showing
advances of a penny on all act.vo options.
Tills of itself would have acted as a
tonic on the local Markets, but was sup
plemented by the further news that the
Argentine shipments were unexpectedly
small, aggregating only 16000 bushels.
From the West came the information that
the severe weather to the Northwest
would cause a material decrease in the
movement, and the receipts showed a
marked fallinc off. In addition to this, it
was reported that three cargoes of viieat
had been taken at San Franciscoâ one lor
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 189 G.
shipment to Capetown, Africa, and two to
Australia.
With such news on hand before the
opening a sharp advance was to be ex
pected. The opening price tor December
at 91)^ and for May at 90^ was improved
upon ghortly after the opening by bids
and sales of \i higher, but tbat was the
hit'h-water mark for the day.
The total advance since the previous
Saturday has been 7 cents for December
wheat.
The desire to realize caused many long
holders to throw over their stocks, and a
decline followed. The decline was sharp
and steady, and the price of both Decem
ber and May at the close was at the exact
quotations of yesterday's closing. It is
generally conceded that the selling was
for profit only, and the bearish element
did not participate to any noticable extent.
ARRESTED FOR BIGAMY.
Pretty Mrs. Ah Get, the First Chinese
Woman in the Country to Get into
That Predicament.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 28.â Mrs. Ah
Get, the tirst Chinese woman to be ar
rested in this country for bigamy, was
yesterday arraigned for examination be
fore Magistrate Kudich in the Center
street Poftce Court. Mrs. Ah Get was
arrested on the complaint ofWonL' Hong,
a Chinese resident of New York, who
claimed he had married her in Portland,
Or., in 1893.
In support of this yesterday Wong Hong
proferrod in evidence a typewritten docu
ment, signed by "A. H. Whittaker, Jus
tice of the Peace in and for Oregon."
Upon the document were pasted the pic
tures of Wong Hong and the defendant.
It stated that he (the Justice of the
Peace) had united in matrimony the two
peraous whose pictures were thereto at
tached.
Lvi Tong, a cousin of the compla nant,
corroborated him in regard to the weddin
and told of the feast alterward. Wong
Ho:ig defied when accused by Lawyer
Levy, representing the defense, that he
had us-d the defendant in this city for
immoral purposes. Through a represent
ative of the marriage bureau it was also
proven that the diminutive defendant hud
married Ah Get, a Chinese merchant at
19 Mott street, in the City Hall a month
Kg...
Lawyer Levy then a ked that the charge
aguins: his client be dismissed, two legal
marriagi-s nÃvin^ Ijeen shown. The court
I state.l it would announce its decision De
cember 4. If denied the defense will then
be put in. Ah Get, her present husband,
claims he paid Wong Hong $900 for her
freedom and that no legal marriage with
Hong was ever legally i erformed. The
defendant was dressed in full Chinese cos
tume and in court attracted much atten
tion. From a (,'hinese standpoint. she is
considered quite pretty.
THREE AIRSHIPS,
SAYS HART
Continued from Flrtt Pag*.
the machine to the eastward. Now comes
a story from a man who was evidently on
the other Bi-ie of it.
Steve Morrison of Haywards was in
San Ramon, and coming home to-night
he saw the aerial visitor in snch a manner
as to fix ita location approximately. "I
was drivinsr over the hills from San
Ramon," said he, "when I noticed a very
bright white li^ht in the sky west of me.
It looked like an arc electric lijtht, but was
too hiÃli in the heavens for that, and then
I knew there were no arc lights out in that
part of the country. It was a surprise to
me and I watched the thing very care
fully. I first noticed it as I came up out
of one of the si:. all valleys and could see
It move ibont nntil I went Into another."
Maishal Raniage of Uavwards tails a
story which may result in clearing up the
mystery of the affair. "It has seemed
very *t range that this mysterious light
should be seen in this vicinity so often.
It Is possible that the thing, whatever it
may be, is being kept up here somewhere.
1 know of only one place where it would
be possible for an airship to be worked out,
and I can hardly believe that even there
the material could have been taKen in
without exciting some suspicion, James
Spiers, of t!'Â« firm of Hmckley Spiers <fe
Hayes of San Francisco, readies out in
the Palomares Canyon, and is quite an in
ventor. His 50ns are great students also,
and it might be that they have been at
work on something of this kind, and have
succeeded in cetting a ship that will really
travel through the air.
"I recently had a talk with a man who
worked for them this summer, and he told
me that a new trail had been constructed
from the house up to the table land near
the crest of tho hill and in a canyon, l
know the place, and it is hidden entirely
from view and would be an ideal placa for
such work.
"I asked him what the trail was beinÃ
constructed for, ami he said he asked the
same question and was told that all that
wa^ required of him was to do the work
and not worry about what it was for.
After this he completed the work without
further questioning. He does not know to
this day wuat the trail was built for, and I
know of no one who ha^ ever Been on the
place or on th â¢ new trail."
An interesting story was told by W. H.
Warren in Crane's store on Thirteenth
street. Warren is encaged ir. the chicken
business above the Zeile place. Accord
ing to his statement he has succeeded in
inventing a machine that he states he
made a trip in, reaching: the height of 100
feet. This took place at San Pedro not
over a month or so ago. He is quite a
young man and a clever machinist. He
has a complete working model capable of
carryin : one man. It is made in the
shape of aci Â»r, with a ronnd head, and
bnilt of a light frame covered with tin and
fitted with wings, and a tail lite a fan.
The machinery is worked with gasoline.
A trial trip was made and was a success.
The inventor objects to exhibiting his
machine, as he has not yet secured a
patent on it. He says he secured his idea
from watching the tight of the seagull.
The machine ia now in San Francisco.
He has not yet used electricity, but ad
mits that it wonld be a great improve
ment.
George R. Toyne, who interviewed V/ar
ret} for the Haywards Journal, said to
night that Warren had a partner whom
he had sent-to Oroville to see if he could
learn anything of tne plans of the new
airship for the purpose of comparison.
HART AROUSED.
His Martial Spirit and Patriotism
Expressed With the Ardor
of a Soldier.
All of General Hart's martial ardor and
spirit of liberty was aroused when he read
the editorial in the Bulletin of Friday
evening which called him to task for be
ing a party to the proposed use of dyna
mite for the purpose of destroying
Havana. The article in question reads as
follows:
A man of former prominence in this State Is
announced through a paper of standing as the
agent or p.ttorney of a man \Â» ho proposes to
destroy the city of Havana with dynamite.
In apparent unconsciousness of the horror
with which dynamite plots are regarded in all
parts of the civilized world this deeenerate
invites a subscription of $10,000,000 to fur
nish the means by which a rich, populous and
beautiful city may be destroyed.
At a time when the â world Is devising ways
to prevent wars with their Inevitable conse
quences, this man. whom the people orice
honored with their votes for a high office,
plans a scheme by which the horrors of war
may be Increased a hundred fold. Whether or
not iho plan is practicable does not mat
ter. It tends to fniailiarize the public mind
with methods of destruction that have been
considered too horrible to contemplate. As
sassination is a playful manifestation of hate
compared to this plan of wholesale murder.
And hil lor what? It Is not proposed to do
evil that good may come of it. It is not pro
posed to offer a sacrifice of Uves in a forlorn
hope to promote a righteous cause.
The assassins of tyrants have been in darker
periods represented as acting under a de
lusion that robbed assassination of its infamy.
But this California lawyer, this man who was
at one time the head of the Department of
Justice for this great State, now proposes to
make murder a speculation. For a mm of
money he proposes to destroy the capital city
of the most populous island in the West
Indies. This proposition is made without any
seeming sense of its monstrosity. It is dis
cussed with the same disregard of moral sense
tho hired bravado exhibits when asked to
name his price for murder.
It is no wonder thct an eminent clergyman
said in his Thanksgiving discourse that Cali
fornia is noted for the startling irregularity
with which society advances. If this eminent
clergyman had seriously considered the dyna
mite proposition he might have added that
California is noted also for the startling
irregularity with which civilisation leaps
backward into the dark ages. The fact that a
proposition of this nature could be placed be
fore the people of this State is a reflection upon
our civilization. The least measure of punish
ment that could be anticipated from a sell
respecting community would be a protest that
would make the State an impossible place of
residence both for the originator of the in
famous proposition and for the agents of dis
semination.
Thnt law and journalism should have com
bined to make the destruction of srrcat cities
a legitimate speculation is much to be re
gretted. It is the province of law to leach
how evils mny be remedied through the exer
cise of reason. It is the province of journal
ism 10 show how society mar lawfully protect
iteelffrom nil kinds of desperadoes ai.d an
archists. Sut in this case a lawyer u>es a
newspapei to familiarize the public m.wl
with a scheme that an average jailbird coulS
not contemplate without horror.
The day for the promulgation of this project
wbb badly chosen. It was a day when peace
and good will were being invoked in public
meetings and private residences. The churches
were open that the people might be taught the
blessing of peace. and charity. In public halls
all through the city the poor were invited to
pa r tate of the rheer of the season. On *uch a
<my the conscience of the people was startled
by a proposition to wipe a great ctty off the
fnce of the earth in consideration of the sum of
$10,000,000.
Commenting thereon yesterday he said:
"My attention ha* been calld to t c
editorial in the Bulletin of last night. AH
I have got to say in reference to it i* that
the destruction ot Havana by dynamite is
not half is horrible as the press dispatches
of the bu'.cueries of Cubans by the Span
ish authorities.
"Of course, in the event that Havana
was to be attacked by the airship with
dynamite sufficient time would be given
for non-combatants to leave the city.
"The apathy shown by the Government
of the United Stages in extending bellige
rent rights to the Cubans, in view of the
atrocities of the Spaniards toward the
Cuoans and American citizens, is such
that it is not to be wondered at that the
genius of American invention should dis
cover a means whereby justice can be
done to those heroes who are fighting for
independence against the oligarchy of
Spain."
"For my part, I consider it far more
noble to aid a struggling people
like the Cubans, who are trying to free
thf mselves from the oppressions of Spain,
even though by dynamite, than to be si
lent and say nothing and practically wink
at the atrocities sbown the Cubans by the
Spanis:. authorities.
"In the event that it should become ne
cessary to capture Havana, either with
artillery or dynamite, it would no doubt
be horrible for those who are located in
that city. But at the same time if it is
necessary to destroy Havana in order that
the Cubans may earn their liberty Ha
vana will be destroyed. And, notwith
standing the Bulletin, I predict that within
ninety days Havana will be destroyed un
less it surrenders to the Cuban forces.
"It appears that the Bulletin U greatly
afrai 1 of dynamite, yet we all know that
the Government of the United States has
been experimenting with dynamite guns
for months, and, in fact, they have reached
such a point of perfection tbat it is pro
posed to use it in guns for harbor defenses
in the Cnited Btates.
"Dues the editor of the Bulletin think it
is proper 'or the United States to throw a
few hundred Doumis of dynamite at some
foreign vessel and sink her or blow her up
and kill or maim tbos^ on board, and that
such an act is not proper lor tie Cubans,
who are righting for liberty? Wo would
simply be trying to keep a vessel out of one
of our harbors, while the people of Cuba
are fighting for the mo6t precious boon of
mankind. I submit that it would be more
proper for the Cubans to use dynamite
than for the United States to destroy a
foreign vessel wuh a dynamite gun.
"I:i the event, as I have heretofore
stated, that the airship should be usp'l for
military purposes in and around Havana
it would be better to haw a base oi oper
tion within thirty or forty miles of Ha
vana.
"There is no doubt that Maceo would
throw dynamite into Havana giving
them ample notice of that purpose. But
suppose that he should give such a notice
Jt ia quite evident that the Spanish author
ities would pay no attention to it They
would simply remain there and doubt the
feasibility of the airship and the horrors
of dynamite until they actually felt it
Therefore it seems to me thai if the Bui
letin would use a little more force in try
ing to persuade the Government to recog
nize the belligerent rights of Cuba it
mipht save itself the horror of hearing
that a few bun lred people had beea de
stroyed by dynamite.
"It seems to be the American policy of
late to permit all kinds of atrocities and
to permit its citizens to be trampled upon
in foreign countries without makine more
than a mere protest. As an American
citizen who has known something of the
horrors of war 1 protest against such a
policy, ant for one say that it fs necessary
for the Cubans to begin using dynamite.
The sooner they use it the better it will be
for Cuba and American civilization.
"Certainly the generalship shown by
Antonio Maceo and his associates and the
fact that the part of the island of which
they have control has opened free schools
on the system cf the pnblic schools of the
United States convince me that Maceo
would be warranted in using anything
that God has created or man invented to
give to the people or Cuba their political
rights and freedom."
The attention of the Examiner has also
been attracted to the Bulletin's editorials,
and it comments thereon yesterday as
follows:
â¢ An evening contemporary gravely criticizes
ex-Attorney-General Hart for his scheme to
destroy Havana with dynamite dropped from
a cruiser of the air. The scheme Is rather
blood-curdling, considered as practical war
iare, but it is extremely interesting from the
point of view oi romance. The romantic
quality is highly developed in General Hurt.
Personally he would not hurt a fly. He never
did hurt one, as far as ktiown. But he re
ceived his nomination to oflioe as a hero accus
tomed to revel in carnage on ensanguined
battlefields.
What more natural than that his mind
should dwell on new deeds, even goner than
those whose narration gave him his fame ?
The exercise will please him, and it will do
nobody any harm.
We'can think of no one better qualified to
be the custodian of an airship than General
Hart. Our evening contemporary is wrong to
chide him for the use he proposes to make of
fai'9 charge. The more exciting he can make
ita programme the more the payety of the
commonwealth will be promoted. A reference
to the airship was medicine that soothed even
"California's" glooia on Thanksgiving night.
To this the Bulletin in its editorial col
umns last nigh; rejoined as follows:
The Examiner gently chides tha Bulletin
for having taken the proposition to destroy
Havana by means of an aiiship seriously. The
scheme our contemporary admits to be rather
blood-curdling, but is considered interesting
trom a romantic point of view. It Is not sup
posed that military authorities have beea
greatly disturbed by menace of the airship.
In fact, General Weyler is more intent upon
defending Havana from the insurgent forces
than from the California general who derives
his title from a civil office. But there are lots
of people ir. the world who do not weigh either
men or propositions scientifically. They take
a man seriously if he takes himself seriously.
It Is not likely that California has heard
the last of this dynamite scheme. It will be
diiated upon us illustrating the characteristics
of our people. The romance of the proposi
tion will be visible indistinctly, if at ail,
through the smoke of a series ol dynamite ex
plosions.
People are no* curiously awaiting fur
ther developments in t:i is paper warfare,
with ?ympathy leanin.T toward the side of
the Cubans' advocate and defender.
SAW IT FROM THE DOME.
Graphic . Story To!d by George
Scott, Assistant to the Secre
tary of State.
Georse Scott, assistant to Secretary of
Stale Brown, was at Sacramento on tne
night of the first reported visit of the
aerial wonder to that city. He gives a
graphic account of what he witnessed.
â¢'Three friends and myself were stand
ing in front of the Capitol," he said,
'â¢when the strange ligbt first met our
gaze. 1 said that I saw the light moving
in the southeastern part of the city
toward the northwest, but some one in the
group ridiculed the idea.
"He said it looked like a light in some
distant house on the hills, and that the
appearance of its moving was due to the
mistiness of the atmosphere.
"1 had the key of tbe building in my
pocket and suggested that wo go up into
the dome and take a look at the phe-
nomenon. We climbed up and there saw
the lii-hts very distinctly, sweeping across
the sky toward the northwest. There
were three of the lights, and they ap
peared to be attached to some bods', of
which we could only discern a dim outline.
"li's no use trying to tell me that there
is no airship," he sententiously concluded.
WAS NOT STARS.
Attorney Hurst of Woodland Satis-
fled Himself as to a Strange
Light.
WOODLAND, Cal., Nov. 28. -M. D.
Hurst, a weil-known lawyer of this city,
discerned a bright and unusual light in
the skies about 10 o'clock last night,
traveling in a southwesterly direction
from Woodland. Nearly all Mr. Hurst 1 *
neighbors also witnessed the phenome
non. Their tirst impression was that the
mysterious light was a group of stars, but
closer observation convinced t em that
this was wrong. The lights appeared to
be electric and were watched for an hour.
Mr. Hurst is fully satisfied thai if the
mysterious object was a mechanical con
trivance it could not have been operated
by a person on the ground. He watched
it upward of an hour from a window in 1
hia home. He does not pretend to say
that it was an airsh p, but insists tbat it
was not stars. Two fc'alvation Army offi
cers, 'who were driving from Knights
Landing to Woodland, corroborate Mr.
Hurst,
Heard Them Talk.
UKIAH, Cal, Nov. 28.â E. G. Case,
grand chief ranger of the Ancient Order of
Foresters of the Pacific jurisdiction, and
William Held, official stenographer of ttie
local Superior Court, left this afternoon
for Potter Valley, a small town twenty
miles north of tlih city.
A telephone message was received from
Held at 7:30 o'clock to-night containing
the startling information that they had
seen an airship when within tiro miles of
their destination. The two gentlemen
were drivin? along in a double team when
the airship passed so close to them that
their horses were frightened.
The gentlemen distinctly saw the aerial
wonder. It was Cigar-shaped and was evi
dently suspended from a ball on.

FRESH HOPE FOR
THE HAIRLESS
Professor George Newcomb
Discovers a N?w Use
for the X Ray.
Out With th? Annoucement That
the Wonderful Light Will
Cure Baldness.
Some Interesting Experiments That
Bring Forth a RejuveDator for
tbe Baldest of Pates.
SALEM, Mass., Nov. 28. â Professor
George NewconiD, demonstrator of physics
at the State Normal School, whose experi
ments With X rays have brought him
some little fame, is out with the an'uounce
metit that they will cure baldness. Some
time ago he was obliged to discontinue
his experiments throilgh ill effects experi
enced after many months' continuous ex
posure to the mysterious light. His
finger nails, skin and the hair of liis right
hand all came off, and he suffered excru
ciating pains in that member. But since
he has ceased experiments along the
original line the nails have grown again
and there is an unusual and surprising
giowth of hair upon the hand where it
had all come off.
It is Mr. Newcomb's theory tbat it was
the effect of the high induction coil he
was using and not the'X ray itself which
produced his trouble, and his theory that
with an influence machine which he is
now building, constructed of glass and
rubber plates and developing a current of
enormous tension but comparatively low
ampeerage, he can obtain even more won
derful results and without the ill effects
attendant upon the use of the Tesla coil.
He believes that he can grow hair on the
baldest of pates.

IN THE REALM
OF JOHN BULL
There Is Now a Friendly
FeeliDg for the
French.
THis Is Due to the Cementing of
Ties Between Russia and
â¢ England.
Under Recognized Chiefs tbe Liberal
" Party Will Have a Definite
Programme.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 28. -There baa
been a sineular change of late in the tone
of the French newspapers toward Great
Britain, notabiy in tbe cases of the Siecle,
Matin and Temps. These papers, instead
bf attacking "perfidious Aloion," as has
been their wont, have' swung around and
now ndvocnte the cultivation of a French
o allionce with Great Britain.
According to information from a high
official quarter, the change is due to a
cementinp of relations between Great Brit
ain and Russia. It is an undoubted fact
that during the recent visit of the Czar nt
.Balmoral, the Queen's residence in the
Highlands, the Anglo-Russian question
concerning boundaries in Centra! Asia
was absolutely settled.

(Incorporated),

That Big and, Popular Store.
Both tbe French and the German semi- |
official newspapers have published in
spired communications on the subject,
and they all concur in praising the Czar
for abandoning the Russian desire for con
quest and completing the division of the
Asiatic continent under the single aim of
tho interests of civilization.
Whether either France or Germany is
entirely pleased with the solution of this
long-pending matter is questionable.
There is at last a good chance that the
prolonged disarray of the Liberal party,
produced by Gladstone's desertion of the
lead at a critical crisis in the life of the
party, will bi ended, and that Liberalism
will once more have a definite programme
under recoenized chiefs. The general
committee of the National Liberal Federa
tion meets at Liverpool on December 17 to
discuss a memorandum on reforms in the
legislation of the federation.
This is a simple way of announcing
that the entire membership of the party
is too considerable, and a radical change
must be made in its management. No
question will be raised at the meeting
anentthe leadership. All the local Lib
eral associations throughout the coun
try tacitly or by resolution have ac
cepted S:r William Vernon Harcourt as
leader.
This fact will and has already enor
mously strengthened his control of the
party, besides contributing to the unify
ing of the party forces. It can no longer
be called a headless party, and v is now
about to get a coherent programme
with a better system of electoral manaee^
ment. "
The general committee of the federa
tion, instead of being appointed through
official influence, is to be an elected body.
The executive of the federation, instead
of being appointed by the general com
mittee, is to be elected by delegations
from the Liberal associations throughout
the country.
The new principle embodied in this
scheme of party management is essen
tially representative and democratic.
Anent the programme, all that can at
present be divulged is that home rule,

The Healyites have started a fund in
opposition to the Nationalists' subscrip
tion, initiated by Dillon under the resolu
tion of the national convention in Septem
ber. No Â£reat prospects existe 1 for the
Nationalist fund from theoutÃut, and the
Healy appeal for command of a separate
fund will effectually diminish what
chance there was of getting the necessary
aid from the Irish poopl^.
Healy cannot hope to get my substan
tial response to his appeal, but he caa in
jure the Nationalist funil, and he has.
When the j.nrty meet*; at the opening of
Parliament Dillon will insist upon Healy
and his supporters either 'completely
abandoning tbeir opposition or withdraw
ing. Failing reasonable submission to
Â»he majority the Healyites will be for
mally expelled.
Communications have been reopened
between the English Foreign Office ami
the French and German governments
pointing toward another cr>n:erence on
the sugar bounty system. Without being
able to state what Government took the
initiative, it can be affirmed that official
opinion on eacli side favors the abolition
of the bounty premium. The En lish
Colonial Office is constantly receiving
the worst reports of the decreasing ? ro^
perity of tbe sugar estates in the West
Indies.
It is stated by recent mail advices
that the majority of the great planters
put five years as the limit of the West
Indian sugar industry it the bounty sys
tem among European powers continues.
AÂ» present, the profits are almost nil. only
the working expenses being cleared, al
though the cost of production has been
reduced lrom Â£18 Â»o Â£10 per ton.
Chamberlain, who has been consulted
on the projected conference, is understood
to think little of any agreement bein&
arrived at, but will not oppose tbe
negotiations to obtain the abolition of the
bounties.
Oificiala of the Shipping Federation

The largest gathering of Non-conform
ist churchmen ever had will take place on
Murch 0 next in the City Temple, London.
Although called a Congress of Evangelical
Free Churches, and really a pure Non
conformist assemblage, the Archbishop cf
Canterbury, the Bishop of Rochester and
other eminent Enelish churchmen have
written letters of sympathy with the
m'vemen;.
The elimination of all relieious or polit
ical polemics from tbe agenda of the
congress accounts for the support of the
action by English prelates. The pro
gramme cannot exclude ail controversial
matter, but all subjecs ar*. it is under
stood, to be treated on a broad Christian
basis. The Lord Mayor will give the dele
gates, lay and clerical, who will come from
all parts ol tbe United Kingdom, a recep

Silently, if not secretly, the English
Government has raised the forces at the
Cape of Good Hope from unaer 2000 to
over 5000 men. The ordinary force at the
Cape was a battalion of infantry and a
detachment of artillery. Since the Boer
trouble broke out drafts from India, sup
posed to be pcing home, have gradnally
been stopped at the Cane, and a number
of them have been sent on to Natal.
The Transvaal Government is restless
and concerned under this increase of
British preparations which are ostensi
bly based on the necessity of meeting
contingencies in Rhodesia. The rela
tions between the Jioer Government and
England are practically tnose of continu
ous mutual di>tru*t and latent enmity.
The Canadian Premier. Laurier, is* ex
pected in London, accompanied' by Sir
Richard Cartwnght, Minister of Finance,
next spring. The questions of assisted
emigration, a fust mail service and impe
rial aid toward enlarging the defense
works on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts
of the Dominion will be the leading topics
discussed b>-tween the Canadian Ministers
and Chamberlain.
It is whispered in prominent theatrical
quarters that the high salaries now re
ceived by leading actors and actresses are
menaced with notable diminution. The
profession is getting overstocke-l and em
inent popular artists are finding them
selves too frequently '.'at liberty" for pro
longed periods.
Among the actreÂ«ses who are at present
politely announced as "resting" are Mrs.
Patrick Campbell, Miss Evelyn Millard
MiÂ«s Elizabeth Robins, Miss Janet a!
Church. Miss Marian Terry. Miss Lily
Hnn bury and Mrs. Bernard Beere. Miss
Miliaru hss been "reciting" at be lad con
certs and Mrs. Campbell has been giving
a reading at St. James Hall.
In addition Mrs. Campbell, Miss Robins
and Miss Church have been playing at
this week's nietinees of Ibsen's "Little
Eyolf." Their appearance has been in
the nature ola gracious intervention, not
a permanent engagement. The hi s h sums
stil demanded by these artists has some
thing to do with "their lack of continuous
employment. The dny.s are gone wben a
really capable nctnr ur actress was con
sidered paid with Â£100 per week, and the

NEGOTIATING ANNEXATION.
Probable Object of Minister Cooper* Trip
In Ihin Country.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Nov 21. â A
stronsr impression now exists in Honolulu
that Minister .Cooper's errand to the
United States last month is nothing less
than to assist Minister Hatch at Washing
ton in negotiating a treaty of annexation
with President Cleveland. Cooper took
the Government stenographer along as
private secretary, a strong indication that
his errand was of peculiar importance.
It is not learned why tlie Presiuent is be
lieved to have changed his mind as now
to be approachable on the subject of an
nexation. It is hi.'hly prouatle that
Cooper hopes in some way to serve the
cause of annexation.

' BERLIN, tJERMAKY, Nov. 28.â Nothing

ceived from St. Petersburg announcing
1 â¢ the* action of the Czar in seizing inde

The strike of tue dock laborers in Ham
burg is interesting the German public
much less than it interests the people of
foreign countries. This feeling is largely
due to the knowledge of the home public
that strike agitations are futile in the face
of the legislative restrictions, as under the
law of Germany an international federa
tion of workingmen is illegal, and the Do
lice are empowered to seize circulars and
djssolve meetings and also to summarily
expel foreigners concerned in such agi
tation.
The demands which are being made by
some of the English papers for recogni
tion of claims lor indemnity oil the part
of Tom Maun, the English labor agitator,
on account of his expulsion from Ham
burg the other day, are sheer nonsense.
The expulsion of Ben Tiilel, an English
laborer, some time ago, was made the
subject of English diplomatic protest,
, although the English papers have asserted
that it was not. The London Foreign Of
, fice knew better than to give thÂ« matter

--390,075 for the fiscal year 1895, an increase
of $13,586,125. The receipts from customs

of $2,479,622.
The total expenditures for the year were
$352,779,446 as ::pains: $356,195,-9S for 189 5,
a decrease of $4,015,852. The deficiency
for the year is $25/203,245 or $17,601,977 less
than for the last year.
The net receipts from the $262,315,400 of
bonds sold in 1894, 1895 and 1896 were
$294,104,295, In tno filteen months ending
with September last the withdrawals of
gold from the treasury in redemption of
United States notes aivl treasury notes
amounted to $192,972,205, whiie the net
gains of gold from all sources attained a
total of $93,813,902.

1896, aggregated $1, 709, 840. 323 as compared
with $1,676,120,983 on the samy date in

According to a revised estimate of the
department the composition and distribu
tion of the monetary stock for the fiscal
year 1896 is as follows:

The grand agcrepate is $2,348,338,571, as
compared with $2,399. 704.688 for the fiscal
year 1895. While these figures show an
apparent loss of more than fifty millions
of money, the department officers say
that as a matter of fact the loss does not
now exist. Many millions of gold went
abroad prior to the closing .< of the last
fiscal year, thus showing an unfavorable
balance, but it is claim d that since the
inflow of gold has recurred and the impor
tations have "grown' this ruoney, witn a
considerable: addition thereto, has come
back to the (Tinted States. The net pro
ceeds of the National banknotes redeemed
during the year were $ 107,891,026 34, the
largest amount for any like period in ten
years, and, with the exception of three
years, the largest since 1879. The cost for
the redemption of National banknotes
has been assessed against the banjts at the
rate of $1 12),Â£ per $1000.
The appendix contains a large amount
of new matter of interest to bankers and

THAT HOODOO ON THE TEXAS.
Every Seam of the Unlucky Battle-Ship
Polluted by the Foul Waters of
the Brooklyn Navy- Yard.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 28.-An
otber source of anxiety over the future
usefulness of the battle-ship Texas has
arisen in the navy. This time it is a
warning from the medical officers of the
service and it relates to the probable
effect of pollution of the intricate interior
of the ship when sixty-one of her compart
ments were filled with the sewage^con
taminated mud for which the waters of
the Brooklyn Navy-yard have long been
noted. One of the leading bacteriologists
of the naval surgeon?' corps has raised the
point that while it will be feasible to wash
out most of the foul sediment that was de
posited in accessible portions of the vessel
it will be exceedingly difficult lo reach
the numerous seams in the bulkheads and
small angles into which solid particles of
sewage have accumulated, and that the
affected compartments should be emptied
of their contents and a drastic disinfection
attempted.
Precedents are cited to show that serious
results to tiie crew might follow a visit to
West Indian waters, where enteric dis
orders breed rapidly. The medical de
partment of the navy will resort to ex
treme measures to clean the ship before
she leaves the Brooklyn yard.
THAT DEEP HARBOR SITE.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 28.âAd
miral Walker, chairman or the commis
sion appointed to select a site for a deep
sea harbor in Southern California for com
merce and for refuge, has shipped to Los
Angeles a great box of data and maps re
lating to the work before the commission.
The commission will meet in that city
on December 16, and will probably remain
there two mouths. Admiral Walker said
to-day that tbe subject would be gone
into, as it had not received attention from
Congress. Persons interested will be per
mitted to appear and be heard, and all
the light possible will be thrown upon the
subj ct. It is probable that the report to
the Secretary of War will not be made till
the return of the board to this city.
Internal Revenue .Receipts;
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 28.â The
collections of internal revenue for the
month of October were 113,275,205. a de

DOUBLE TRAGEDY
AT SAN JOSE
J. P. Kelly Fatally Wounds
His Wife and Then
Himself.
Shoots the Woman Repeatedly
and Gashes Her Throat
With a Razor.
Turns Hi? Revolver Upon Himself
When Officers Arrive and
Op?n Fire.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 28.â A tragedy
that will probably result in a murder and
a suicide was enacted in a jewelry-gtore at
116 West Santa Clara street about 9:45
o'clock this morning. The principals
were J. P. Kelly, the proprietor, and his
wife, Annie Kelly, or Annie Pitty, as she
was sometimes known. The weapons used
were three revolvers and a razor. Officers
Prindiville and Shannon also joined in tbe
shooting and fired several phots each, at
Kelly, who resisted arrest. Mrs. Kelly
was slashed with a razor on the right side
of the neck and the first finger and thumb
on her right hand were cut. She leceived
a bullet in the right shoulder, a slight
wound in tbe left side, and was shot
through the right arm. Kelly Das three
bullet wounds in his head. Annie Kelly,
a six-year-old daughter, received a slight
flesh wound in the arm.

For the past year they have tailad to get
along well together, and they had numer-

Wife and Shot Himself to
Escape Arrest.
ous quarrels. Two months ago Mrs. Kelly
had her husband arrested for disturbing
her peace, and only several weeks ago she
charged him with felony embezzlement,
alleging that he nad taken $75 worth of
jewelry belonging to her and kept it. The
charge was subsequently dismissed. It is
said that on one occasion he chased her
from the house with a revolver an J threat
ened to kill her. For the past week the
couple have not been living together, and
the woman had taken steps toward begin
ning suit for a divorce.
Mrs. Kelly had been occupying separate
apartments from her husband, in the Ray
mond lodging-house, over me store. This
morning the woman, accompanied by her
little daughter, left her room to go up
town. As she started to pass the store*her
husband called to her. She did not stop,
and Kelly stepped out, seized her by the j
arm and dragged her into the store and
locked the door. He then told his wife he
was going to kill her, and drew a revolver.
The frightened woman broke away Bud
ran to the back of the store, pleading for
mercy for the children's sake. The two
little cuildren were in the store at the
time, and they ran about crvintr. "Papa,
don't shoot mamma; don't shoot"
As the woman ran Kelly picked up a
revolver and tired at her, but missed. A
second shot struck her In the right shoul
der. She then run to the front door, and
there the wounds in the arm ani side were
inflicted. The woman fell, and Kelly,
procuring another revolver, fired several
more shots at her.
It was then that Kelly took a razor to
cut the woman's throat. He seized her
by the hair and slashed her neck on the
left side. She grubbed the razor.
Just then Policemen Prindiville and
Shannon arrived and tried to break in the
door. They were unable to do so. but they
broke the glass in the upper part of the
door and began shooting throu^ the win
dow and door at Kelly. Seeing the officers
Kelly picked up anut <er pistol from the
counter aud started for the rear part of
the store. A> he ran he hred three shots
at his own head and fell in a heap. Two
tvere only scalp wounds and the other en
tered the temple, and will probabiy prove
fatal.
W!>en Mrs. Kelly had her husband ar
rested for felony embezzlement she told
the officers that she and Kelly had never |
been married, but had eloped together j
from Australia about eight years ago. Slie i
said that Kelly had a family in Melbourne. |
This morning after the shooting she stated
that she and Kelly had been married by
contract nine years ago in Australia, and
that they were* nf.terwar I married byÂ» a
Presbyterian minister in London.
Kelly made a dying s atement to Dis- j
trict Attorney Herrington. He said he '
was born in Alton, lii., and was 54 years j
of age. He said his wife sometimes went
by the name of Mack acainst his consent.
Kellv has an uncle, M cbaei Kelly, and a
coutin, John Kelly, residing in Litchlield,

and a daughter. One son died recently, j
The other resides in San Dieso. His name j
is James Reliy. The daughter, who is I

ttory told by his wife about the marriage.
In Kelly's pocket was loand a letter ad
dressed to a Mr. Lewis, in which the
writer said he was tired of iife. He com
plained that a man in San Diego had
alienated his wife's affections.
Kelly claims that Officer Prindiville
shot him, but Mrs. Kelly says he shot
himself. Kelly was possessed of consider
able property, and this h- left to the two
small children. It consists of several lots

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 28.â James P.
Kelly, who shot himself when about to be
arrested for attempted wife-murder at San
Jose this morning, has a lone and crooked
record. He has a son and daughter in
San Diego.
Kelly, while at Denver in 1884, ordered a
big lot of jewelry from an Eastern nrm.
amounting to about $5000, remarked and
reshipped it at Denver for some point on
this coast, and disappeared.
He sent word to his wife and children to
follow him to San Antonio, Tex. They
went there, but he was nowhere to be
found. Mra. Kelly was forced to work
out, and her two sons and daughter, as
they grew older, supported them-elves.
After some years of bitter poverty, Mrs.
Kelly procured a divorce and married O.
Btelzner, and moved to San Diego. Later
her children followed her.
â¢ T u c e elder so . n went iri{o partnership
with Stelzner in a grocery, and buili. up
quite a business. The mother died, and
the children took up 320 acres of land at
kscondiuo. With the strictest economy
they managed to acquire a ii;tle property
worihs3oooor |4000; including three lot's
at San Antonio. Soon after his mother's
death the eldest son, W. F. Kelly, stepped
on a rusty nail and died of lockjaw.
Last November, after a silence of eleven
yeirs, without a word received from him,
i Keily turned up at Philadelphia. He had
ti^d to Australia Pursued by Dun's
agency, and after a checkered career, he
ieturned to Philadelphia, taking with him
the woman, Mrs. Mack, whom be tried to
kill yesterday. She left her husband and
took her two little children with her.
Kelly, learning of his children's good for
tune in San Diego, wrote a loving letter to
them and soon afterward arrived here.
He then went by the name of MacK,
Finding that his children did not dis
play enough filial affection to turn all
their property over to him and the woman
passing as his wile, Kelly broucbt suit,
first having obtained the appointment as
administrator of his decsase.l son. The
old man took possession of the grocery
and under his management the creditors
sot the store. The court awarded the
property at Escondido to the old man,
and the boy, after working hard for a
number of years, was left without a cent.
The daughter's portion of the estate was
I also confiscated by Kelly.
For a short time Kelly ran a small
jewelry-store, tbe property being- in the
name of Mrs. Mack. The business fell
through, and Kelly, after robbing her, de
serted her and went to San Jose. She
learned of his whereabouts and followed
him to San Jose some months ago. They
made up and lived together, with occa
sional quarrels, until to-day's tragedy
closed the chapter.
DR. GUDERKY'S SUCCESSOR.
Dr. William O. Utimpson Ordered to Re
port at San Francisco.
PORT TOWNBEND, Wash., Nov. 28.-
Dr. William G. Stimpaon, who for the past
two years has been in charge of the quar
antine service in this district, left to-day
with his family under telegraphic orders
to report at San Francisco. He succeeds
Dr. John Godfrey, in charge of the United
States Marine Hospital in that City.
It has been known for some time that
Dr. Godfrey desired a transfer, and the
presence of Surgeon-General Wyman in
San Francisco was believed to have been
more for the purpose of bringing about
that result than for an inspection, as was
c:iven out. Wheu Godfrey was advised
Mrs. Annie Kelly.
of the corrmg change in station all
arrangements were being perfected for
a general transfer of officers, among

SPENDS HIS LIFE
IN THE TEPEES
A Child Stolen Forty Years
Ago Becomes an Alaska
Tribesman.
Placed Among Indians by the
Man Who Took Him From
His Home.
A White Brave at Sitka Identified as
Willie Heidenf-ldt, Once of
Vancouver.
PORTLAND, Oe., Nov. 28.â Chief- of Po
lice Robertson is in receipt of a letter
from Suka, Alaska, solving a mystery of
forty years' standing, and which but few
persona in this v.ciuity have even the
slightest recollection of. It brines news of
a man who, back in the fifties, when he
was a toddling babe, way stolen from his
home and conveyed to the wilds of the
frozen North, there to grow up among In
dians and adopt tbe forest as his home.
In ISSG, Vancouver, Wash., then a
sparsely inhabited settlement, was a fa
vorite place of recreation lor many of the
Hudson Bay Company's men. Among
the families then dwelling in what now is
Vancouver proper was that of Philip
Heidenfeldt, who had a beautiful flaxen
haired boy named Willie, at that time 4
years old. "Long John" McGregor, a
Hudson Bay Company man, loved the
child as a father would his son. "Lone;
John" had saved about $30,000 during his
long service with the company.
All of this he promised to bequeath to
little Willie if the parents would allow
him to adopt the child. The Heidenfeldts
were poor, Dut not so needy as to be forced
to part with a child dearer to them than
they believed it possible that it could be to
"Long John." They even refused $5000
in gold coin from McGregor for the priv
ilege of making Willie his heir and taking
the child along withhim.
In April of that year "Long John" re
turned to his duties in the frozen Arctic,
where his business was mainly with the
Indians in the interior of Alaska. With
McGregor's departure also disappeared
Willie Heidenfeldt. That the Scot
had stolen the child was not doubted by
any one knowing his attachment for it;
but no trace of the man or the boy could
be had until they reached Alaska. Then
all the law tbe poor parents had at their
disposal in those days was impotent
either to punish the child-stealer or to re
store their boy.
"Long John" some time in the '60's
was frozen to death while returning to
Sitka from a business trip to tbe interior
in an open sled. The s-addest chapter of
this Hory at that time was that Mc-
Gregor, like most men of his type, always
imagining death in their caÃes to be" a
century or more distant, neglected to pro
vide for his protege. He failed to maice a
wili, and when death claimed him every
dollar of his estate went to distant rela
tives in Scotland.
The greater part of McGregor's time in
Alaska being : pent among the Indians, he
had placed the stolen boy in tbe custody
ot a iribe with which his business rela
tions were the most extensive. And with
that tribe Willie was when death overtook
"Lon; John." and with that tribe Heiden
feldt, now a man 44 years of age, is to
day. He frequently visits Sitka. bearing
an Indian name and speaking English
with the broken accent characteristic ot
an Indian.
The writer of the letter received to-day
was in Vancouver when the boy was stolen
and knew Wiihe quite well. The child
was peculiarly niarked at his birth; he
had but one joint on each of his little
fingers and one of his eyes was black and
tbe other a dark brown. This optical de
lect in Heidenfeidt, when the writer saw
him in Sitka a month ago, recalled the
abduction of forty years ago to bis mind.
Engaging the man in conversation, he
noticed also the other physical defects
marking him when he came into -this
world. Without being prompted by lead
ing questions tbe Indian tribesman ad
mitted than he recollected having been
taken from his home by a rough-looking
man and placed aboard a ship. Beyond
that his childhood recollections were quite
vague.

CHILEAN BLOOD
AT BOILING HEAT
Balmacedisfs Determined to
Overthrow President
Errazuriz.
0 ficers of the British Cruiser
Wild Swan Say Fighting
is Inevitable. . .
The Nation is Eager for War,
Whether Internal Strife or
Against Foreigners-
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 28.â The Brit
ish cruiser Wild Swan, whicharrived yes
terday from South America, brings news
of tire situation in Chile, whicb has as
sumed the gravity of a threatened revolu
tion, if not actual resort, to arms. The
Wild Swan was at both Coquimbo and
Iquique during the troub'esonie times be
fore an i after September 18, wh.ch is the
Chilean Independence day and also the
day. of the National elections. There was
greai excitement thou-hour C.iile duriu,:
â¢ the campaign. The followers of Balma
.ceda, supposed to be a remnant of envious
political malcontents, made sucu a pow
erful showing b fore election <hat serious
trouble was leared, especial y at Iquique,
and the Wild Swan was ordered to that
port from Coquimbo to protect British in
terests in case of an outbreak. It was at
Iquique that the officers of the cruiser be
. held scenes bordering on anarchy.
"A couple of us was in a restaurant,"
said an officer to-day, "when an altercation
occurred between a Balruacedist and a fol
lower of Errazuriz. Tlie Balmacedistâ
Coonel Andres Escandon â flapped the
Errazurist in the face, and it was with
great difficulty that their friends pre
vented bloodshed on the spot. Subse
quently there was a duel, and the frienls
of each principal discussed the subject
until some inkling of the truth came out.
Then it was learned that the Balmace
dists, through a pretended coalition with
the opposite party, being in reality a fu
â  sion -of Liberals and Conservatives, were
giving their consent to the election of
Errazuriz with'the intention of gaining
time for a conspiracy then lorming to
overturn tne Government.
"Through this fusion the enemies of
Errazuriz secured ihe promise of several
piaces in the Cabinet. These men were
to foment dissension among the support
ers oi Errazur.z, and on the overturning
ot the Cabinet to take advantage of the
crisis to start a revolution. We heard
tbese rumors both at Coquimbo and
Iquique, but thought there was nothing
specially important in them, as there is
always a lot of that talk flitting about in
Spanish-American -countries.
"Well, Erruzuriz waselectedon Septem
ber 18, but the majority was the smallest
ever given to any Cliiieau President.
Public, fevling was aj. .lever heat. When
we returned to Coquimbo we found great
discoritent among certain classes and rev
olution talk was quite open.. People were
diss,iti<.fii'il with the Cabinet chosen by
the President, and he did not seem to get
a!ong with it himself. The report of the
Fuiance Minister showed a deficit of
a'l.owi $S,t>oo,ooo for 18%. and this added to
the' trouble. Chile has been spending
much money on her, navy. During 1895
â  she spent. 15,<-00,000 pesos, and the appro
priations for 1896 were siill larger. The
people ohjecteu to the heavy drafts upon
them.
' "As early as October 20 we heard au
mors that the new Cabinet would have to
ste.p down. These rumors multiplied,
with hints ot something more serious
coming, and 1 am not surprised to hear of
.a revolution breaking out. It comes a
month or. so sooner than we expected,
however. When we left South Ametica
the President had 'rouole with his Minis
â¢ ter of the Interiur regarding the appoint
ment of Governors for certain districts,
and the Minister, who was said to be a
eecret-friend of the revolutionists, made a
good deal of trouble. One or two other
â¢meTubers of the Cabinet threatened to re
sign if Errazariz pressed tho matter..
"â¢But it was on the financial question
Â£hat| t.ne Cabinet and President SDlit. The
Cabinet assumed a die atorial tone, and
this drove many Liberal members of the
Chamber of Deputies over to the Presi
dent. The result was the certain down
fall of the Ministry when Congress met
on November 2. We were at Guayaquil
then and did not hear of the outcome.
We heard that President Errazuriz had
sent for Barros Luco, a leading Liberal
politician.' to form a new Cabinet
in case" the present one was broken.
Luco accepted the invitation and
.1 have no doubt the new Cabinet is of his
makin&r, hut the Balmacedists, assisted by
tho-e members of the Cabinet who are
aggrieved at the President, are at the bot
tom of.the trouble in Chile and there is
every indication that it will be serious.
'"'The nation has reached a point where
itfJpeople believe themselves the most
powerful in tlie New World, not except
ing the United States. They are spoiling
for a fight and if they cannot get it from
abroad they are liable to light among
' themselves."
OPPOSES TWO CLAIMS.
.â¢â¢ Don' M. Dicken son Argues Before the
"..* . Bering Sea Commission at
Victoria
â  . VICTORIA, B. C, NÂ«v. 28.-At the sit
. tin^ of the Bering Sea claims commission
â â¢" to-day the cottns 1 for the United States
â  moved to strive out two of the claims tiled
by the B.itisu side.
â ' - O^eof these was that on behalf of tho
schponer Blapk Diamond for $7500 for loss
' arising from her being ordered out of the
â ' -.'BeringSea in 1886. The other was the
p^rsonaVclaim of Captain James Gaudin
; for $:Â«K)0 in connection with the seizure of
"' the schooner Aida.
Mr". Dickinson said, in making his
*â¢ motion to strike out the 188G claim of the
" Black.;.Diajnond, that on the question |
. raised might. depend a precedent which
â¢ might come before the commission in
[.various forms, and if the Uni;ed States
.â¢ was "correct In its contention the claims
did' not come wi:hin the terms of the con
vention which hnd resulted in the forma
tion of the present commission.
. If would be noticed that two claims had
been filed on neha f of the Black Diamond.
One was for $2500, by reason of the
Â«chooner leaving Bering Sea in 1886 as the
result of a verbal order of the United
States Collector oi Customs at Ouna.aska.
The second was for $23,000, by reason of
Uie seizure of the schooner by the Hush in
1889. â¢
lhe'case of the Blnck Diamond, as far
as the claim of 1886 was concerned, was
not, he said, in the list of claims that
came before me Paris tribunal, and fn the
summary of claims re'ern-d to in article 1
of the convention only the 1889 case of
â¢ Hint schooner was mentioned.
Di kinson maintained that unless the
claims ivere in the schedule refened to in
article 1 of the convention they could not
be considered by. the commission. '
It needed no argumen to -how that the
case ol the schooner in 1886 was indepen
dent of th,e claim for 1889; but aside from
that, ; the convention had taken extra
"pains to say just what should come before
â¢the commission. By the terms of the
convention, he argued, only those claims
submitted to the Paris tribunal were to be
dealt with by the commission, with the
exception of additional claims of vessels,
in which list the Black Diamond did not
appear: therefore her claim for 1880' could
not be considered.
Mr. Peters for the British side said his
understanding of Dickinson's argument
was that the objection taken to the claim
of the Black Diamond for 1836 was that
the vessel's name did not appear twice on
the list of claims and that, therefore, the
date was the material point to be consid
ered.
The British side, on the contrary, main
tained that the date was merely stated in
the schedule . for information and con
venience, and was not a vital point. The
claim of the Black Diamond was iea!ly
â¢in extra to the other claim of the same
schooner, and was so mentioned by Sir
Julian Pauncefot' 1 in his correspondence
with Gresham in 1894.
This letter from the British Embassador
distinctly showed tb it it was contem
plated to include the 1886 claim of the
Black Diamond among those to be dealt
with, and furthermore, there never was
any objection raised by the Unued States,
a* far as correspondence went, to the in
cludiner of that cla m.
Dicken-on and Beique continued the ar
gument at some length, anl the decision
of the commission was reserved.
LOS ANGELES INVENTION.
Fi/.ibuster Ku lay Claims to Have Per-
fected a Contrivance Tnat Will
Blew Up Fleets.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 28.â J. K.
Mulkey of t!ii* city is liable to wake up to
morrow morning and find that he has
accumulated more fame than he can
handily take care of with safety to his
daring plans.
With the special admonition not to di
vulge bis name he has made public a fili
bustering scheme which, if carried out,
woul t play an unheard-of part in naval
warfare and astonish the civilized world.
Mulkey, it is claimed, has invented a
naval destroyer capable of annihilating
every gunboat fleet of any power on earth
on short notice. Mulkey's soul goes out
to the oppressed Cubans, and in Cuban
waters In proposes to employ his annihi
lation first, in an attempt to end the
island war.
"I have figured the problem so closely,"
says the inventor, "that within ti.ree
hours after sighting an enemy she will
surrender or be blown out of the water.
Escape is impossible. The size of the
attacked ship and the caliber of her guns
cut no figuie.
"And further, my ships are ready â one
in England and one in Franceâ and I ex
pect to leave within the next ten days to
take personal command of this little fleet
that will rut an end to the war wiihin
thirty days after we enter Cuban waters.
I am in direct communication with
Macpo's army, and received word from
his chief of artilif ry 10-day."
The alleged invention is some sort of a
torpedo, the precise nature of which the
inventor does not announce.
"I could sell my secret to any of the
great naval powers of Europe and become
a millionaire at once," said Mulkey, "but
I prefer to liberate Cuba, which will be
rendering a real service to humanity and
will at the same time insure my future
â¢welfare financially and otherwi-e.
"I at first intended to give the United
States the benefit of my invention, but the
policy of the Government in making pub
lic al! war inventions determined me to
keep my secret. I wrote to Secretary Her
bert recently about the folly of this Gov
ernment expending any more millions for
b'.tile-shiii!-, when none were proof against
such inventions as mine, but I suppose
ihe Government will go riÂ«ht on building
ships until I give a practical demonstra
tion of what I can do by blowing up a few
Spanish men-of-war."
It is said that this is not the filibuster
ing scheme which has been hate ed in the
fertile brain of Mr. Mulkey. He is said to
have originated the late t ropoaed filibus
tering exp dition to the Hawaiian Islands.
LOS ANGELES FORGER.
X. J. Laird Will Be Brought to the City
to Sf Mid Trial.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 28.âDe
teciive Steele will leave to-morrow for
San Francisco to bring back L. J. Laird Jr.

About five months ago Laird went to a
local firm of grocers, passed a forged

Some time after this detectives learned
his whereabouts and sent a description to
Captain Lees of San Francisco. The au
thorities had arrested Laird already on a
felony charge and the local officers told
them to go ahead and prosecute the
prisoner.
Captain Lees wired later that Laird had
been heM to answer. To-day word was
receive.! by Chi-f Glass from the north
asking if the authorities here wanted to
prosecute Laird on t c forgery charge.
Captain Lees was advised to hold Laird
until the arrival of a local officer.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1896.
DEATH'S HARVEST
AT POINT ARENA
Nine Vessels Lost on the
Jutting Rocks Within
Thirty Years.
Lives Sacrificed Because of the
Absence of Life-Saving
. Apparatus.
Citizens Will Appeal to Congress for
the Establishment of a
Station.
POINT ARENA, Cal., Nov. 28.âWith
in the past thirty years there have been
wrecked and completely destroyed on the
no:th side of Point Arena the following
vessels: Bark Hyack; ship Elizabeth
Buckley, two lives lost; schooner Piioebe
Fay; steamer Eastport, three lives lost;
schooner James Townsend, crew rescued
with difficulty; steamer San Benito, six
lives lost. All of these vessels were lost
in passing.
In Arena Cove, on the south side, the
steamers Constantine and Point Arena
went onto the reef, but were pot off
badly damaged. A number of schooner-,
whose names cannot be recalled, have
been lost in the cove. A. little to the
south of the cove the steamier West Coast
went onto the rocks and eiglfl lives were
lost. A mile south the steamers Point
Arena and Alcazar went on to Blunders
reef, but succeeded in getting off badly
damaged. At lversens Landing, bye
miles south, the schooner Ida Florence
broke from her moorings and foundered
with all on board. A large number of
lives have been lost in the immediate
vicinity of the point by the capsizing of
small boats.
The citizens of Point Arena are agitat
ing the subject of bringing the great
necessity of a life-saving station here to
the attention of Congress through the
California members. In the r cent wreck
of the steamer San Benito, north of the
point, in which six lives were lost and
nearly forty men were left exposed to
heavy seas and clinging to the rigging for
two days, if only a surf- boat or rockets
capable of carrying lines to the wreck
had been at hand the lives would have been
saved and the suffering avoided. But
there was not a suitable boat to be had
while the peril of the crew was watched
by a crowd ashore helpless to aid them.
Captain Brown of the life-saving station
and othets. who composed tbÂ« voluntary
crew which distinguished itself for
bravery in attempting to reach the
wrecK and save the crew in a ship's boat,
failed because the boat was not the kind
that could ride the heavy surf.
Indian Bi.l was one oi the members of
this brave crew. He did not seem to think
any more oi riiking his life than he would
of accepting an invitation to dinner. The
hat was passed around on the main street
the other duy and a total of $4 went into it
for Indian Bill. He was very proud of
the gilt and proceeded to dispose of the
money in true Indian fashion.
Manuel Lazarus, nn Austrian, was an
other member of this volunteer life-saving
crew. A story is told of Lazame which
not only illustrates the mettle he is made
of, but the mettle of the entire crew. Two
\ ears ago a little steamer, said to have
been the Point Arena, became disabled in
a heavy iea off the point. A hawser had
dhitted overboard and became coiled
around the propeller, stopping it. While
the steamer pitcued and rolled in the
tempest Lazarus took off his clothes and
climbed down over the stern with a
hatchet. Clinging with one hand to the
rudder post between seas, which alter
nately engulfed him and brought him inio
sight, he whacked away at the line until
he cut ihe wheel free. His bravery was
suitably rewarded.

BROOKLYN PEOPLE OBJECT.
They Will Sot Tolerate Priae-Fiqhti in
Any Form.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 28.-The Cor
bett-Fitzaimmons right cannot be pulled
off in Brooklyn. This was definitely
settled this morning at the conference be
tween Foster L. Backus, District Attor
ney, Warren, manager of the Greater New
York Athletic Club, and Police Commis
sioner Welles. Lewis offered a purse of
$26,000 for the big fellows to fight for at
his club. Corbett had signified his accept
ance. After a brief discussion the District
Attorney gave his opinion that the pro
posed match was a prize-fight, in viola
tion of the law, and would not be allowed
to take place and the men will not be
allowed to go into the ring for the pur
pose of having the right. This emphatic
opposition of the District Attorney, as
concurred in by ihe police, ends the mat
ter. The New York Bohemian Club's
offer of $25,000 is now to be considered.
As Police Commissioner Roosevelt has
declared himself in favor of scientific box
ing the Bohemian Club will probably get
the fight.

CRASHED ON TO
A SUNKEN ROCK
Mishap to the Steamship
Dalles City on the
Columbia.
The Vessel Beached to Prevent
It From Rapidly Filling
and Sinking.
Order Was Preserved With Difficulty
Among Twenty-Five Terror-
Stricken Passengers.
THE DALLES, Ok., Nov. 28.â The
Dalles, Portland and A-tona Navigation
Company's steamer Dalles City, with
twenty-five passengers and an unusually
heavy cargo, narrowly escaped destruc
tion on the upper river last evening about
half way between The Dalles and the Gov
ernment locks at the Cascades. Her
passengers had an exciting experience,
as it was feared for a time that tbe strong
current would sweep the disabled boat
down the river.
While trying to make her (vay up thn
current, buffeted by floating ice and
beaten by a heavy gale which drove her
out of her course, the Dalles City struck
on a submerged rock.
A large hole was stove in her bow and
as the water began to rush into the hold
Captain Johnstone quickly put her about,
ordered on full head of steam and ran for
the Washington shore. The vessel was
beached without difficulty, but it was not
without some trouble that order was pre
served among the passengers.
The heavy cargo and the passengers
were landed at Wind Mountain, twer.ty
miles from The Dalies. The passengers
were transferred to the Oregon side of the
river, where they reached an Oregon Rail
way and Navi ation Company train.
Floating cakes of ice interfere with navi
gation on the river, and the new hy
draulic machinery on the Government
locks is frozen fast, so that it is impossible
to get boats through. The Dalles City,
which plies between Portland and The
Dalles, arrived at the locks yesterday
aiternoon and waited several hours try
ing to get through, but finding it impos
sible Captain Johnstone decided to return
to The Dalles. Telephone lines were all
down lait night, and news of the accident
was not received until to-day. The Dalles
City carried several carloads of cattle and
hogs.

Execution of a Aegro Murderer.
COLUMBIA, Ga., Nov. 28.-A special
from Zeale, Ala., says: Jackson Young,
a negro, was hanged here to-day. The
murderer ascended the scaffold smoking a
cigar, seemingly indifferent to his fate
until the trap was being adjusted. Then
he gave signs of some fear. The doomed
man neitber confessed nor denied his
guilt, but said that he was ready and wiii
ins to di<i.
The crime for which Young was banned
was most brutal and revo.ting. His vic
tim, a young girl about 16 years old, was
his sister. She was found with her sku.l
crushed and shattered with an ax and her
facp mutilated. The girl recovered con
?ci>usp.ess long enough to tell that her
brother had done the deed.

MAY SUE THE
CITY FATHERS
Property - Owners Want
Their Rebates on Taxes
Paid.
Brokers Making Fat Commis
sions Out of the Super
visors' Delay.
Auditor Broderick Says That the
Board Has No Right to Hold
B^ck the Funds.
Unless the Board of Supervisors allows
the payment of the rebate on taxes paid
in the early months of V lis >' ear t0 De K in
on December 2 it is probable that it will
have a large-sized storm about its ears.
A iarge number of those who have
clhims against the City on this score are
quietly arranging a pooling of interests
with the ultimate object of beginning
proceedings to compel the board to allow
the payment of the rebate:
During the months of March, April,
May and June of this year about 29,000
pro erty-owners paid their taxes on the
$:: 25 rate lixed by the Supervisors last
year and bacarue entitled to a rebate when
the Supervisors fixed a lower rate for this
year.
Tne law says that taxpayers who have
paid a higher rate than the one fixed by
the Supervisors shall be entitled to a re
bate immediately on presentation of their
receipts after the Auditor has computed
the uraount due them, and that the
Treasurer must pay their demands at
once.
The Auditor's accounts, showing the
amount due each of the Â£9,000 taxpayers,
have been finished and ready lor use for a
month past, but owing to the action of the
Supervisors have never been used. The
attorney employed by the board to collect
delinquent taxes r commended some time
ago that the rebates due those who were
delinquent in former years be held as pay
ment for the delinquencies, and the board
ordered that the paymeut of rebates bede
lerred until December 2, the legality of the
proceeding to be luoked into in the m<-an
t me. The money tied up by the resolu
tion aggregates $175,000, and those to
whom it belouiis are growing anxioua
about it. A large number have., been sti'l
further alarmed about i.he payment of
tneir claims b\ receiving costal cards on
which was- printed the following:
. You are entitled to a rebate on the taxes
which you paid last spring. It will probably
be mon>hs, if ever, belore this rebate is finally
fiaid and there will be over 35,000 claimants
n line. I am ready to pay cash for your
claim now. There will be no delay, no wait
ing lor months and in the end standing in line
for hours if you bring your 1896 receipt-to
this office and get your cash from me at ouco.
: W, P. MtSAUs,
130 Mills building, fli tv floor.
It is said that Musaus and others who
are engaged in the Mime business are
backed by â  syndicate, wnich has pnt up
the ca-h to buy several thousand claims
and expects to make from $30,000 t0 550,000
out of tb'e transaction.
The average offer when claimants call
to sell .heir claims is about 50 per cent,
the rest being profit, as the only
form to go throdeh is to present tne re
ceipt, eet an order on the treasury and
draw the money;
Auditor iiroderick said yesterday that
in bis opini6n tbe board had no right to
hold rebates to pay delinquent taxes, and
that if tbe delinquent tax collector wants
to earn bis commissions he has a regular
legal -way through the courts.
"These people have been out their money
for an average of seven months," he said,
"and the cush has been lying idle in the
treasury, when it might have been draw
ing interest or used in business. It
loots a little like standing tuem up to
keep them out of their just dues in this
way. The law on the matter is plain, and
I see trouble ahead for the City if the
money is not released on December 2.
Tbe only ones who are benefiting by this
delay, as far as I can see, are tbe brokers
who are buying up the claims."
Those who arÂ« arranging for action
a ainst the City are reticent about the
matter, but state that they will do noth
ing until after December 2, when the de-
Jay caused by tiie board's resolution .ex
pires. ' : .
The action, if any is commenced, will
take the form of an injunction. against the
Supervisors from interfering further in
the distribution of the rebates.

Arrival of the Oceanic Steam
ship Australia.
The British bark Gainsborough is on
her way to San Francisco. After going
ashore on the reef near Diamond Head, at
Honolulu, she was got off and temporary
repairs were made. On her arrival here
she will go on the drydock and be thor
oughly overhauled, after, which she will
go hence to Honolulu under the Hawaiian
flag. Her name will be changed from the
Gainsborough to the Diamond Head, and
like her sister! ship, the .Roderick Dhu,
she will be known as a "sugar boat." -
The accompanying sketch shows \ the
GainsborougD : leaving Honolulu for San
Francisco with Diamond Head in the dis
tance. Chief I Officer Lawless of the Aus
tralia says that the bark will have to be
riveted from the keel up to the turn of the
bilge and that new earboard strakes will
have to be put on. Other work will have
to be done and : the Diamond Head will
be several weeks on the drydock. here
before she is ready for service again.
The Oceanic Steamship" Company's Aus
tralia arrived from Honolulu yesterday
morni ng with the following passengers:
CM. Cooke, wife and child; Mrs. Captain
M. Foley and son, George \V. Heintz, R. C.
Scott, Hon. James McCuuden, Captain John
Fitzgerald, A. E. Forrester, W. Lewers, Miss K.
McCudden, Miss N. Keliogg, Mrs. S. C. Crane,
William Wilder, J. M. Maxwell and wife. J. A.
Kennedy, Miss M. HitchcocK, Frank Vida, L.
A. De la Nux and wife. Rev. J. P. Lytlon, P. G.
Pochin, B. F. Schoen, Mrs. S. Levi.
The voyage was an uneventful one. ex
cept that on the 25th inst. one of the En.
lish tramps that left here a few days ago
was passed in latitude 31.35 north, longi
tude 139.22 west. The tramp has a load of
wheat for Calcutta and is making good
time.
The Australia brings the news of the
heavy weather encountered by the Mono
wai. The vessel left here with a heavy
deckload, and encountered a storm on her
way to Honolulu. Two waves struck her
in rapid succession . and made sad havoc
with the cargo on the forward deck.
One of three larÂ«e boilers lashed to the
deck as freight was carried away, being
lost overboard and considerable damage
was done to the pilot-bouse. About
twenty-five feet of the starboard rail, was
also carried away and the steerage flooded
with water.
During thirty-six hours the Monowai
was kept under half speed, bareiy holding
her own against the lury of the storm. By
Monday morning, the 16t!i inst., the wind
had abated and the remainder of the trip
was pleasantly made.
I. K. James, the popular chief steward
of the Aus raia, nÂ«s made his last sea
trip as an official. Next week he starts
for New Orleans to assume command of
one of the laigest winter hotels in the
Southern metropolis. On the last trip
Mr. James was presented with several
pieces of jewelry and a "purse of sover
eigns," besides a laudatory testimonial as
to his Qualifications as a caterer.
Mr. James has been with the Oceanic
Steamship Company for years, and he has
always been considered one of the most
popular officers in the empioy. His place
on the Australia will be taken by J.
Seeley of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's Pomona. The latter was
brougin up in the employ of Goodall,
Perkins & Co.. having worked his wav tkp
to the position of chier of the Walla Walla
from that of cabin boy.
Tho whaleback City of Everett had con
siderable trouble getting away from Main
street wharf yesterday. The" Washtenaw
was docking and tne whaleback backing
out. iae two vessels narrowly escaped
coming together and the Everett struck
the dock. Very little damage was done,
but the escape was a narrow one.
Captain David Wallace of the City of
Topeka i* on the sck list and Captain
Hunter of the UmatiJJa will take his place
on the Alaskan route. In the mt-antime
Captain Thomas will remain on the Mex
ico, on the I'uget Sound route, until the
Umatilla is once more ready for sea.
La Loie Fuller was the center of attrac-
tion on the water front yesterday. She
toot the Pacific Mail Company's steamers
by storm and now wears the buttons of
Captain Smith of the City of Peking and
Captain Frank Johnson of the City oi
Sydney on her watchchain. Miss Fuller
has a penchant for collecting buttons, and
in conseqnence Corporal Cockrill of the
Hnrbor police and Superintendent Ander
son of tbe Mail dock are both seeking to
match missing links on their overcoats.
Miss Fuller and her mother were the
guesis of Mr. and Mrs. Schwenn. Mrs.
Kliicot and Htrr Stevens, MiÂ«-s Fuller's
manager, were also among the guesis.
The officers ot the two big steamers were
in full uniform, and the company's tug
was sent to Mission-street wharf to hrinc*
the guests to the Mail dock. Miss Fuller
thoroughly inspected the Peking, and
made up her mind to make the trip to
China on her. From Hongkong she will
go to Peking and dance before. Li Hung
Chang and the Emperor. On the return
trip she will dance before the Mikado, ana
will probably return to San Francisco with
several foreign orders keeping the cap
tain's buttons company in her watch
chain.
The men on the Belnga are at outs with
the Pacific Steam- whaling Company.
They assert that they have not been paid
in full and are seeking to recover what
they consider their just due?. They have
engaged an attorney. The men say they
have not been given anything like fair
treatment and that when called upon
they will tell all about the alleged srnutj
eling of rifle- and whisky into Alaskan
waters by whalers.

HE KEPT TAB ON
HIS RESCUERS
Gustave A. Lundblad Jumped
Overboard From the
Â£1 Capitan.
After a Long Delay He Was
Finally Rescued by the
Steamer's Crew.
Floated Ten M nutes and Looked at
His Watch to See How Long
tbe Hen Took.
The old ferry steamer El Capitan is
again in trouble. A few weeks ago she
was placed on the narrow-gaujze route to
succeed the Encinal. The latter in tbe
meantime was to be overhauled and put
in thorough repair for tbe winter. In
stead of being put bade on her usual run
the Encinal was releguted to the creek
route, and ever since there has been
trouble. The El Capitan was totally in
adequate io supply tbe rush at morning
and evening, and when Captain Rogers
was assigned to tbe boat he insisted upon
an extra number of seats being put aboard.
Other changes were made during his
watch, and the passengers are now able to
travel in comfort, bat when it comes to
life-saving the Â£1 Capitan is sadly defi
cient.
Yesterday, while the ferry-boat was on
heT usual noonday run from the narrow
gaii'.-e mole to San Francisco, Gustave A.
Lundblad jumped overboard. He is con
nected with the Contra Costa Laundry
and is well known to shipping men on
the water front. It was at least four
minutes before the captain of the El
Capitan was notified of the attempted
suicide, and it was at least four minutes
more before a boat was lowered. In the
meantime women wrung their hands and
the wail from one end of the ship to the
ot er was general. Stronjr men cursed
the deckhands and many a fist was shook
in Captain Brooks' face because he did
not lower a boat.
All the latter could say was: "Gentle
men, I am doing everything possible to
save the man. You may not perceive ir,
but tbe boat is going full speed astern.
She was coing full speed ahead when the
news reached the pilot-bouse, and, of
course, tbe headway has to be overcome.
The boat is gathering sternway, and to
lower a boat now would mean loss of time,
as tne tide will carry it up the bay. The
steamer can beat a rowboat, anyway, and
if you will keep quiet we will do all we
can."
The captain of the El Capitan was as
good aa bis word, and ten minutes later
the man who made all the trouble was in
the stoke hole of tbe steamer, with every
stiich of clothes off and his teeth going
like castanets.
The would-be suicide, Gustave A. Lund
blad, is emuloved by the Contra Costa
Laundry and lately has been drinking. A
couple of days aeo he went qjcer to Ala
medn to enjoy himself and yesterday on
the advice of his friends started for home.

will never be known, but one thing is cer
tain that he took a drink at the bar and
then walked forward and balancing him
self on tbe rail of the steamer jumped
overboard.
"Providence takes care of drunken men,"
is an old saying and it must account for
ttie escape of Lundblad from the paddle of
the El Capitan. He droppeu right in front
of the revolving wheel and yet bobbed up
astern a" if though nothing had hap
pened. When picked up he had his watch
in his hand and looking at the time re
marked to tbo men who came to rescue
him : "Mine gracious! you fellara are very
slow."
He had a heavy overcoat and heavy un
derclothing, nevertheless he did not even
lose a sintrle garment, nor was he ex
hausted when pulled into the steamer's
boat.
"How did it happen?" he was asked by
a reporter.
"Well, don't you see I failed overboard,"
was the answer.
"Well, how did you fall overboard?
"Now. I don't sfmst know, but I tinks I
had half a yag on. Yes, by jimmy, I
tinks I had three-quarters of a yag on, and
when I sat on the rail of the steamer I
falls overboard. Mine graciou3! but it was
cold, and then I forgets ail about tne
whisky and thinks or getting aboard
the ship again. I had a flask in my pocket,
and when it got cold I took a drink and
feeis better. I never expected the boat to
stop and took out my watch to figure on
how many minutes I had to live, and then
I saw the â¢ steamer backing up and hope
revived. Ttoen I knew I had nothing to
fight but the cold, so I folded my arms
and floated. My hat came along and 1
grabbed it and put it on my head, so I
came aboard just the same as I left, only
a wetter and a wiser man."
Lundblad made another trip on the El
Capitan. One of tbe firemen supplied
him with uorne underclothing, and the
chief officer made him take a good drink
of whisky out of his own (Lundblad's)
flask. A few hours later be was feeling
as well as ever, and the vessel was as good
to him as a home. When bis clothes
were dried he started ashore, and assured
Captain Brooks that he would go to his
lodgings.
It was fully eight minutes (many of the
passengers say twelve minutes) before
Lundblad was picked up. He passed un
der the port wheel, wore a heavy over
coat, was in the icy water all the time, ana
yet is alive. A Call artist was the center
of the excited group of passengers who
watched the wouui-be suicide rise and fall
with tbe backwash from the El Capitan,
and take out bis watch to ascertain the
time of day. Just how the man escaped
and lives to tell tbe story is a mystery.
THE FAIR CASE.
Deeds Photographed â A Request for
Xhelr Unconditional Possession.
Another Deposition.
Yesterday morning DelmaÃ&Shortrldge,
out of courtesy to Pierson & Mitcheli and
A Master of Medicine and Surgery.
There has probably never been a phy-
sician or surgeon in San Francisco who
was so liberally patronized by the sick and
suffering, and at the same so highly praised
by them, as tbe dist nguished specialist,
Doctor Cook, whose offices are permanently
locat d at 865 Market street.
His private consultation rooms are daily
visited by people not only of San Fran-
cisco, but from all over the West They
come from every station of life. Among
them are bankers, lawyers, merchants,
mechanics, ministers, farmers, laborers
and literary gentlemen, many of whom
have repeatedly sought relief from other
physicians, and have repeatedly met with
disappointments.
While they go to Doctor Cook full of
disease and despondency, they come away
from him full of hope, confidence and joy,
and feeling better in every way. From
that very hour they begin to permanently
improve. What the great specialist does
to them, or tbe kiud of treatment he ad-
ministers to them, is a secret known only
to himself â a secret upon which his re-
markable success is founded.
The vast volumes oi" testimonials in
Doctor Cook's possession are the strongest
and most convincing proof of his ability
to combat aud cor.quer all the different
diseases that come within bis specialty.
They show that he bus cured numberless
cases of female complaints, men's private
ailments, rheumatism, chronic catarrh,
blood and skin diseases and functional
diseases of the heart, lungs, liver, stom-
ach, kidneys, bladder and urinary organs.
But Doctor Cook's special treatment for
lost manhood and its many attending ail-
ments of physical, mental and sexual
weakness, is the crowning elory of his pro-
fessional career. It is a treatment known
to no other physician in America. It is

deeds to the inspection of any counsel and
under any conditions, even to t .c "extent
of taking the deeds out of the possession
of the present holders, which it is under
stood no court would permit.
In the matter of the case of Caldwell vs.
Fair Delmas & Shortridge yesterday served
noi.ee of the taking of tne deposition of
Charles L. Fair next Thursday. One of
the points to be ascertained was the as*
surar.ee that Fair had promised to return
certain letters lont to him, and also that
a formal demand for their return had been
served upon himâ the contrary having
been asserted. Other objects it is thought,
will be effected i y the de-o-itiin.

distinctly of his own creation or discovery,
and is the result of a lifetime of persistent
study, diligent research, and scientific in-
vestigation in this and foreign lands. It is
purely vegetable in its composition and
perfectly harmless irt its effects. It does
not stimulate temporarily, but restores
permanently. During the past fifteen
months it has been tested on more than six
thousand young, middle-aged and old men,
who, as the result of errors or excesses,
were tortured by the woes of nervous de-
biJity or sexual decay. It has never yet
failed, even in tbe worst of cases, to biing
back manly power and to remove every
symptom of weakness.
There are several reasons why Doctor
Cook has won his way to the very front
rank in the practice of medicine arid sur-
gery. All who consult him are satisfied
with his fair, honorable and upright meth-
ods. His extensive experience, profound
learning, and superb skill are also power-
ful factors in bis favor, but in addition to
all this he is thoroughly equipped with
every instrument and apparatus essential
to the most moiern methods of practice.
His scientific X-Ray examinations reveal
wonders, and his electrical appliances are
th* largest and most complete ever oper-
ated on the Pacific Coast.
Doctor Cook receives callees in his offices,
at 865 Market street, each and everyday
from 9 to 12 a. m. and 2 to 5 and 7 to B*>. m.,
except Sundays, when be may be consulted
from 10 to 12 a. m. only. Those unable to
call upon the doctor will do well to write
him their troubles fully anil without reser-
vation. He offers to send them free of
chtirpre his new and valuable book devoted
to diseases of men. His system of home
treatment by mail is eminently satisfac-
tory and always successful.

SARAH SPENCER'S
MANY HUMBUGS
The New Woman in the
Fair Case Is an Ad
venturess.
: Her Shady Record in Many
'â¢ "Dark Deeds Brands H?r
:â¢.â¢.â â . a Fraud.
: ; None of the Attorneys Trust Her or
Know Aught of Her Mysteri
ous Pretenses.
Mrs. Sarah Owen Spencer, a weak
â¢ woman who has, had considerable unenvi
able notoriety in the past, has come" to the
front with a mysterious and mythical
story about the estate of the late James G.
Fair, pretending also to great wisdom
about tne affairs of Mrs. Craven.
'In .spite of the woman's dramatic play
that her strange statements were made ia
prospect of impending death the strangest
fact-is that nobody knows anything about
hfcr save her doubtful record in other
matters.
Inquiry at the law offices of Delmas &
Shortridge elicited the information that
they had never heard anything about her
" and cared absolutely nothing about her
i<reposterous claim of great knowledge of
"theirclient. "Her statements are all abso
lutely false was the reply made by these
attorneys."
. Though the notorious woman's odd
statements might seem at first blush to
favor the interests represented Dy Attor
ney George A. Knight, he seemed equally
as much startled and dazed as anybody
el9e, and rejected the voluntary interjec
jioh of new evidence with firmness aud
dignity.
If the woman's evidence relative to the
matter is of no more worth than her sen
sational statements concerning her own
health it will cut a sorry figure in the case.
â¢. A few days aco she or her friends sent
word to the variaus newspapers of the
. City fo hasten trusty stenographers to her
deathbed to obtain revelations that would
.*. surprise an anxious world.
Almost before ihe woman who was
thus described as writhing hi the throes
of dissolution could be seen at. the LiÂ«k
House she was hurried to St. Mary's
Hospital, where she is now resting in
better health.
â¢ Mrs. Owen's physician is Dr. W. S.
Thorn, a man of unimpeachable charac
ter and standing in bis profession. He
wonders to whom his patient referred
â¢when she said, "I have- been told I have
but a few hours to live," for he takes a
different view.
tipeakinj: of Mrs.' Spencer last nieht Dr.
jFhornsaid: "The woman is very Hi with
"ulcers of the stomach, and this disnase
will ultimately kill her. While. she is as
bad now as she had been during the ten
months she has been under my care. I do
hot think she is in any danger of dying
j-oon. She might linger a long time in her
._ present condition or might die almost any
"' time of hemorrhages."
The mystery of Mrs. Spencer's position
is intensified by the boldnes*, not to say
audacity, by which she states that the
Craven deeds, letters and marriage con
tract are forgeries, and that she knows
these things by reason of her enjoyment
â¢of the absolute confidence of Mrs. Craven,
for whom she declares she ha* been pre
serving a mysterious and valuable docu
â  ment for, four years. She appears to be in
her senses, and her story is coherent, im
probable and ridiculous as it seems.
The woman's past career now becomes
an important factor in viewing her present
statements. 'Po say the leasr, her record
is spotted with sensational allegations de
rogatory to her character. Her name has
of te:i been associated in an uncompli
mentary way with the Christy forgeries,
inrconnection with which she was alleged
to : ; be ihe criminal who appeared before
, Lee D. Craig as the maker of the forged
â  papers.
At one time she had a suit against the
Iron Mountain Railroad Company for in
juries alleged to have been inflicted at
Texarlcana. In this case she obtained a
judgment for $20,000. It was from some
of the evidence in this case that Notary
, Craig learned thru she was the same per
son who imposed upon him. The Circuit
Court of Little Rock, incidentally, has
ordered thnt the woman's deposition be
taken here for use in matters now pending
tjiere.
.Mrs. Spencer was prominent also in the
case of Witzeman vs. Spencer before Judge
. Slack,- wherein the judgment was based
on eviden.ee that s'how'l that she cleverly
netted more ihan $10,000 on a fraudulent
pcheme railed the Southern California
Fruit and Orchard Company. She in
, duced Mrs. Witzeman to put aDOut $10,000
.in money and property into this venture,
having made plausible statements that it
had a large paid-up capital and was clear
ihjr quite laige dividends.
Many stories are afloat regarding the
Spencer woman's stranee ambitions and
, adventures. If haif of them are true sne
has bad.many plans afloat that have net
fe'd a good income.
Attorney Alexander Campbell h3S at
various times been employed- in matters
affecting her character, and he is in pos
session of enough information to make a
romance.
'â¢At onetime the woman claimed to own
â¢ 'valuable land near Cotton wood. Shasta
. County. "-said Mr. Campbell, 'â¢and indured
Police Sergeant Coot of this City to think
. bf trading for it. He went up and saw it,
â¢ and had Dorn & Do'rn examine the title, as
â  a resul* of which the trade fell through."
Transactions with John Riddle at Day
ton, WasL., show that the woman obtained
forty lots from him by shrewd dealing in
â¢ "At another time the woman obtained a
.*. number of lots at Twenty-eighth und

DUBOCE CLEARED.
Tho Ueutenant-C/>lonol Obeyed Orders
'* .and Will >ot Be Court- Marti aled.
Lieutenant-Colonel Victor D. Duboce,
commanding the First In fan try Regiment,
. Second Brigade, N. G. C, has been com
pletely exonerated by Brigadier-General
V.'arfield from all responsibility for the
failure of the regiment to receive General
Warfield and his staff Wednesday evening.
It will be recollected that an inspection
took place "Wednesday evenin?. The regi
ment was inspected by inspectors ap
pointed by Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce.
Immediately after this the regiment was
dismissed. Soon after General Wariieid
and his staff arrived at the regimental
.irmory and found it prp.cticnlly deserted.
For a day or two after there was some
newspaper talk concerning a possible
court-ivartial !or Liciitenarii-Colonei Du
boce. Thai official has made a reyort.
which is on hie at regimental heac'quar
Â»e:s. It has i:cen duly perused by Briaa
dier-General Warfiolcl, and it appears that
there was a misunderstanding concerning
the order calling for the regimental in
spection.
Lieutenant-Colonel Dnboce in his report
partly censured Major Charles Jansen.
The colonel reported that at the time of
tlie inspection Major Jansen was not
present, and the colonel assumed the
major would report later to receive his
(Duboce's) special reports from the regi
mental officers.
Therefore, reported Lieutenant-Colonel
Dnboce, the inspection was proceeded
with in pursuance of the exact letter of
instructions. There having been received
no orders to the contrary up to 9:40 p. m.
the regiment was dismissed. Lieutenant-
Colonel Duboce did not consider it his
duty to anticipate that any of the brigade
staff officers would desire to personally
act as inspectors of the various com
panies.
General Warfield has not only accepted
Lieutenant-Colonel Duboce's exp'anation:
in addition, to exoneration General War
lieid has written that he is gratified at tLe
loyalty with which the order was carried
out.
MONEY FROM BLACK SAND.
I'-x-Dlgtrlvt Attorney Selvage on Work
in Humholdt * ouiiiy
T. H. Selvnge of Eureka, ex-District
Attorney of Humboldt County. is among
the arrivals at the Baldwin Hotel. Mr.
Selvage says that. Dusiness is improving in
the northwestern corner of the State, and
that by sprins, in his judgment, things
will be moving quite actively.
"The black sand mines at Gold Bluff,"
said Mr. Selvape, "that have been worked
during the paat season, havo paid quite
well. One of the properties there has oeen
in the hands of a receiver for some months,
and, curiously euiougb, a* I am informed,
it has been lound that the property has
paid very well. It seemed to pan out
better, somehow. There are really oppor
tunities there for gold-mining, and I do
not know that the black sand uas attracted
as much attention for a long while. Some
work is gome on in the mines elsewhere
in the county.
"About the lumbering business, es
pecially the redwoods, I can say that I
believe things are shaping themselves in
a way that will see quite a iittle activity
in that line. I think the mills will start
in the spring earlier than usual. These
am the indications now."
. Mr. Selvage is here on s brief bnsiness
trip. He will probably leave for home to
day.
AFTER ITS AUTUMN BATH.
Golden Gate Park in Its Fall
Costume of Purple and
Green.
Captain Thomson Will Soou Have a
Police Station on Casino
HiU.
Golden Gate Park, the pride of San
Francisco people and admired by all
visitors, looks splendid in its fail costume
of purple and greeu.
The late rains gave to the trees and
shrubs their fall bath, which washed off
the summer dust and gave them an ap
pearance pleasant to behold.
The autumn flowers of variegated hue,
with a preponderance of purple coloring,
lend a most fascinating charm to the
beautiful scenery which attracts the eye
ai broad avenues are traversed either on
foot, horseback or seated in handsome
vehicles which are used by the wealthy
in their daily spins over the well-kept
drives.
A run through the park yesterday after
noon was more of a reminder of a tropical
country than of a North American section
at this time when the telegraph dispatches
announce blizzards and snowfalls within
a few hundred miles of San Francisco,
the aueen winter spot of California.
Tall pine trees that a month ago wore a
dirty brown color from the summer's
accumulation of red du-t had been washed
down, leaving a beantiful creen appear
ance. This with the perfume of highly
cultivated flowers and the niajstic forms
of choice chrysanthemums raised high
above ihe tender collection of violets and
the thousands of srualier but attractive
flower-bearing shrcbs seemingly vie with
one another as to which will Craw the most
attention from those who daily pass com
ments of admiration upon their beauty.
The open lawns so suddenly brought
into view os the winding avenues are
traveled add a charming panorama to the
other Joints of observation. The bright
green grass so carefully nourished by an
abundant supply of water the year round
is one of the features that make the park
attractive at all seasons of the year.
The establishment long desired of a
police station within the park boundary,
where the park police may be under the
command of that urbane* and efficient
ofncer. Captain Thomson, will soon be a
reality, at the building is almost finished.
This structure stands on the knob of the
hill, where the Casino was first located,
and close to where it had been moved and
altcrward taken away to make a resort in
the Richmond Di'trict.
This police station will answer a good
many purposes besides nous ng the olhcers
and sheltering the horses of the mounted
patrolmen. It will be a temporary lock-up
lor persons who cet arrested tor violating
the rules o: the Dark, as aiso a place where
persons injured can be taken until the
police ambmance wagon can reach them.
Taken ail in all a visit to Golden (Jute
Park on a November day, when extra
wr.*ns and heavy overcoats are in requisi
lion, is a treat tt;at cannot be surpassed in
any o'her city in the United States.
HERE'S YOUR OPPORTUNITY.
How to Get a Oreai Reference Work at
the Cost of I'uper and Ink.
Not lonp ago the Pacific Coast News
paper Syndicate conceived the happy idea
of distributing anions readers on remark
ably favorable terms a certain number of
sets of that great reference work, the
Encyclopaedic Dictionary.
The project met with such widespread
appreciation that the enterprise extended
far beyond the bounds originally mapped
out, and many thousands of Bets of the
work wer.j placed In homes that would
probably never have possessed it at the
regular price of $42 to $70 a set.
In the course of the distribution, which
involved the handling, packing and un
packing of many thousands of these sets,
now and then a volume in some set was
slightly rubbed and therefore withheld
from shipment. These sets, of course,
might be rebound and sent out, but the
Syndicate, instead of doing this, purposes
to distribute them ai a nominal price.
The most, serious injury to any set is no
greater than might occur in n few days'
use in one's home or office.
The nominal price arranged for readers
is also payable In smali monthly amounts,
so that many who may have found the
lormer price too high may now uosse9s
one of these special sets at a cost entirely
within reach, both as to price and pay
ment. One dollar is all the cash required,
and the full set delivered at once, with the
privilege of returning within a week and
money refunded.
The Syndicate's address is 14 Sansorne
street, San Francisco, where application
may be made either personally or by letter,
but as the number ol these special sets is
limircd ana as tftey will fee distributed to
the first who apply, prompt application is
necessary.

'TWAS ONLY AN
"EXAMINER" STORY
Sands Forman Repudiates
That Paper's Hypnotist
Yarn.
Says His Condition Is Practi
cally the Same as Before
the Test.
His Family Greatly Mortified Thai
His Ailment Was P.iradÂ».d Before
the Public.
Sands W. Forrnan, ex-Supervisor and
journalist, oenies positively the Examiner
story that he has been cured of Jocomotor
ntaxia by the hypnotic power of Kennedy.
While Mr. Forman expresses the desire
to nvoiu a newspaper controversy, he was
willing last night to make the following
statements:
"I have never been hypnotized and
have never been benefited by tnis man
Kennedy. A few nights ago, in company
with several friends. I met nim in Frank's
saloon, and a discussion of hypnotism led
him to suggest that he try to cure me of
my aiiment.
"Though I was entirely skeptical of his
prowess I consented, and alter he had
gone tliroueii several of his sta;:e maneu
vers and told me to net up and walk I got
up and walked the entire length of the
saloon without the use of my cane.
"This is a thing 1 can do at any time by
making a strong endeavor. 1 aid it for
him the ume as I would have done for a
friend making the request.
"Wnen I returned I told all present
. L^^_ ' NEW TO- DAT." :
The grandest invention of the age for weak men ; the surest and easiest cure for all nervous
and chronic diseases ; its wonderful power is directed to the seat of the nervous system, through
which its vitalizing strength penetrates into all part's of the body, carrying new life to every
function which has been weakened by excesses or dissipation, restoring energy to the brain and
power to the muscles.
Dr. Sanden is a physician of the highest standing among the medical profession,* having
devoted thirty years of his life to the practice of medicine, and has given it up now for several
years so that he may devote his knowledge exclusively to this bettor, more effective means of
rescuing the sick and weary from despair. He.has given to the world this remarkable creation
of his brain, the Dr. Sanden Electric Belt, and personally supervises its use in all cases so that
jin not one single instance may it fail to do all that he claims for it. He is an expert in medi-
| cine and an expert in electricity, and every one of his patients receives his personal attention
until the final happy result is reached â a permanent restoration to health and strength.
THIS GREAT BOON IS YOURS.
In using Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt the patient is assured of two very necessary points that
he has the very best, most scientific, strongest and most durable electric belt that can be made
and with it the personal attention of a : regular physician until cured. It is impossible to imag-
ine a more effective means of fighting disease. All medical men sanction the use of electricity,
and Dr. Sanden by his personal attention to his patients, makes his belt do the work which has
baffled the skill of medical experts of all countries.
"I was treated in Paris, London and New York for a nervous trouble. I obtained no relief
until I got your Sanden belt, which cured me in three months, though I had no faith in it to
start with," writes John J. Barclay, cashier Baker & Hamilton, Los Angeles, Cal., Nov. 19 1896.
â â â¢; "I was treated by three .eminent physicians for paralysis without success, and they informed
me that my case was incurable, but as I was in no hurry about dying, I consulted Dr. Sanden.
His Electric Belt has cured me. I was able to go to work two months after applying and have
been in good health ever since," writes Y. R. Parks, 209 Fourth street, San Francisco.' *
DR. SANDEN INVITES YOU TO CALL.
; .. It is a pleasure to Dr. Sanden to talk with a non-b3liever in the power of his belt, for in this
â¢way many are convinced by scientific proofs who would go on from year to year suffering from i
a curable disease. He will examine every patient free of charge, and state honestly whether a
cure is possible. He can gain nothing by misleading a sufferer, as his best advertisem 9 nt is the
good he has done, and he will take no case where his belt is powerless to cure. He therefore
invites a call or a letter from all who' are sick or weak, so that by personal study ~ of the case- he
may lead his patient to renewed health and happiness. If : you cannot call personally, send for :
Oiis famous book, "Three Classes of Men," which is full of clean, wholesome facts, and has the
letters of hundreds of prominent man in all sections of the State who have been : cured by Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt. Call or address ' : r ":; : â â ::,: .

very distinctly that I was not under Ken
nedy's influence, and did not believe in
his pov.ers. My reason for cairying a
cane is that I can move around* much
| more easily.
"I was interviewed by a reporter in the
i morning, and Baid to dim the same things
i 1 have said to you.
"What was my surprise to read the
next mo'ning that I was a weil man

affliction has not only been very distaste
ful to me, but a source of the keenest
I mortification to my family. lam htartiiy
tired of the w.'ioie affair" and after this
will have nothing more to say about it."
The Examiner has advertised him as
the subject of a special article in to-day's
edition, in which he is supposed to give
his version of the remarkable cfcre effected
by Kennedy, and will in general be made
a star feature of the edition.
In addition to publishing a two-column
story last Wednesday under startling
headlines, the Examiner has since sent a
reporter to him witu a long article about
the alleged cure and a request that he at
tach his signature to i\ which he refused
to do.

Twice in the first half Stockton High
School came very near scoring, but lost
the ball on fumbles when close to San
"Mateo's goal. The two touchdowns that
St. Matthew's secured in that half were
e"ach made after beautiful long runs of
about seventy yards, almost the entire
credit for which is (Tue Snitzer, the man
who carried the ball. -One was made from
a fumble secured from Stockton and the
â¢ other from a contemplated play. The
men on both teams were very uncertain in
holding the ball, particularly after they
were tackled, and in the second half big
Captain .Henion of St. Matthew's, wno
played a star game, several times stole the
ball from the arms of his opponents. A
feature of St. Matthew's game in the
second half was Galvey's well-executed
quarterback kick out in front of Right
End Womble, who made connections with
the ball .on the run for a clean gain of
eighteen yards!. Of all the attempted
quarterback kicks during several seasons,
that one and the one by Benson to Captain
Sherman of the California Varsity in the

.The playing of the San Francisco High
School team was a &urprife. . The local
boys proved themselves the equals in all
departments of the game to their Oakland
rivals, who were previously conceded to
have the advantage. In the first half the
playing was -almost entirely lÂ»r down in
San Francisco's territory alter the kick off ,
and at one time the Oaxland men lost the
ball on a fumble when within, three yards
of goal. The whistle-sounded with the
San Francisco team working rapidly
across Oakland's territory. In the second
half the play and the course cf . the bail
were a repetit'on of the first half except
that San Francisco was the one to. ap
proach twice within a few feet ol goal.
But "two punts were made in the whole
: ame, and fumbles were frequent on both
sides.,. .
For Lowell High School the two BiÂ«hop
brothers, O'Connor, Varney and Chad
wick did very effective work, while for
Oakland/ High fccuool Joe King, Steele,
Chestnut and Nedderman were the more
noticeable on their team * for valuable
playincr. â¢
The ban Francisco and Oakland High
School teams decided after the â¢ game ;to
play off the tie next Saturday a/ternoon' at
Central Park. , Game will be 'called -at: 2
o'clock. The winning team will meet St.
Matthew's School on the same eround on
i the following Saturday afternoon for what
Is termed the academic championship of
L.the State. â¢, Cogswell College, however,
would like to have a say before â  the teams
constituting j the academic league shall
have decided-, the State championship
among themselves without trying conclu
sions with Cogswell, or with the unusually
fine. Belmont? School team,, neither of
which belongs to the league." *
The Y. M. C. A. champion lightweight
team, averaging 133 pounds stripped, is
eager to secure a match with any other
team on the coast averaging 140 pounds
or less to the man stripped. They will
meet the Polytechnic High Schoolteam st
Central Park next Thursday afternoon,
and on Saturday next will play the Acad
emy at San Rafael or the San Joaquin
Valley College at Woodbridge.
LECTURES BY ASTRONOMERS.
Solar Eclipses and the Disappointing
Expedition to Japan.
The Astronomical Society of the Pacific
opened its doors to the public again last
evening at the Academy of Sciences Hall,
and the attendance was large.
A. L. Col ton of the Lick Observatory
gave a historical review of eclipse ob
servations. His remarks were well illus
trated by stereopticon viewÃ.
Professor Charles Burckhalter of the
Chabot Obseivatory delivered an interest
ing address upon the Lick Observatory
eclipse expedition to Japan. He accom
panied Professor Bchaenerle to Akkeshi,
Japan, to take photograph* of the great
eel pse of the sun that took place there on
Au-ust9, 1896. He graphically described
thÂ» trip to the coast of Yezo and the pains
the party took to get everything in .readi
ness kor the great event.
The expedition was ilivided into four
parties scattered over 100 milÂ»Â»s along the
line of the eclipse, but all were doomed to
deep d ; sHppointment. On the day that
the moon passed over the face of the sun
a dense fog settl d upon the land. â¢ Dur
ing the remainder of the stay of the party
every day was perfect.
Before closing his address Professor
Burckhalter described many scenes
through which the party passed while
in Japan, all of which were illustrated
with his lantern and slides.
TEN JAPANESE
TO BE CONFIRMED
It Will Be the First Class
of the Kind in
America.
The Religious Trials of a Brit
ish Sea Captain Will
End To-Day.
Handsome Gift of the Daughters of
the Kin^ to the Church of
the Advent.
There will occur at the Church of the
Advent on Eleventh street to-day some
thing very much out of the common. In
fact it is nothing less than the confirma
tion of ten Japanese, the first class of the
kind to be confirmed in America.
Rev. Dr. John A. Emery, the rector of
the church, in speaking of the noteworthy
incident last evening, said:
"The idea of a Japanese Mission origi
nated partly with Bishop Alt-Kirn and
partly with Rev. Mr. Tai, one of the Jap
anese converts, who has entered the priest
hood.
"Mr. Tai belongs to the warrior class,
which gave him quite a standing among
his countrymen. He was so much of a
speaker that Bishop McKim said be had
seen 1000 men bang on bis words iv an
ecstasy of appreciation.
"He wanted to come to America to per
fect nimself m English and do something
for his own countrymen, but thoujrh he
has accomplished the latter desire he. hns
had no time to carry out hi* wish as re
gards learning English better.
"Rev. Mr. Tai came here two years ago
and started this mission. Little more
than a year ago he went back East and
entered a theological seminary at Alexan
dria. Va.
"His ->lace was taken by Rev. Mr.
Mikarni, a deacon. The Japanese have
their Mission bouse at 709 Geary street.
Some two or three months ago Mr.
Mikarni brought down a Japanese to be
baptized in the church. Now, a class of
teii will be brought down for confirmation
to-morrow.
"He tells me the class will consist of ten
at least, and possibly more. I have quite
a large class ol my own. In ail there will
be between twenty-five and thirty con
iirmed to-morrow.
"The ages of the Japanese vary from 20
to 36 years. All of them seem very intel
ligent fellows. Some of them are now
attending tue State University at Berke
ley."
Another feature of the exercises at Dr.
Emery's church to-day will be the con
firmation of the captain of a British nhip
now in the harbor. He has twice bren
prepared for confirmation in England and
once in America, but in all three cases has
hed to sail shortly before the appointed
time.
At the. services to-day, also, a hand
pome brass ewer, to be used exclusively
for carrying water to the font, will be seen
in the church. Itwasjust received from
New YorK a few days ago, and is the
gift of the Daughters of the King belong
ing to the church.
BOARD OF REGENTS.
A Secretwry to Succeed the Late I>r,

Elected.
The duty of electing a secretary of
the Board of Regents of ihe Uni
versity of California to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Dr. Bonte, will
devolve upon the regents. The choice will
probably be made at the regular meeting
of the board on the second Tuesday in
December.
There were a number of applicants id

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1596.
TITLE QUIETED IN
THE FAIR CASE
Conclusion of the- Suit
Against the Trustees
by Charles L. Fair.
The Ma 4 ter Now in a Shape to
Be Taken to the Supreme
Court.
One by One, the Obstacles to a Sp?edy
Termination <f the Litigatirn
Being Cleared.
Another chapter was added to the- Fair
will case yesterday, the episode occurring
in Judge Slack's court. In the forenoon
Messrs. Maguire, Knight, Heggerty and
Wheeler appeared to renresent Charles L.
Fair and other heirs, and A. Van R. Pater
son, William M. Pierson and Garret
McEnerney appeared for the trustees
under the will. The case before the court
was an action against the trustees to quiet
title.
Mr. Wheeler filed a demnrrer similar to
one filed by him in the former case in
order that the way for an appeal to the
Supreme Court might be made clear.
James BL Angus was called to the stand
and told about the making of the will by
James G. Fair on September 1, 1Â£94 It
was sometime in the forenoon before
lunch. There were present when the will
was signed Messrs. Hittell, McLaughlin,
Bresse, the witness and the deceased.
"Was he of *ou;id mind at the time he
signed the will?" asked William M. .rier
son.
Mr. Wheeler objected to the question as
improper, and read several authorities to
the effect that the rule that sanity must be
presumed must hold in all cases, and that
the burden of showing that the testator
was insane alls upon the defendants.
Counsel argued that toco into any ques
tion of fraud or duress would be to antici
pate objections from the other side Â»L,ich
misat never arise in the case.
Judge. Slack remarked that in some
States a' party is permitted to rely upon
the presumption of sanity, but in a large
majority ot States it is not allowed to rely
upon that presumption, *and they are
oblig-d to offer some evidence to show the
soundness of mind of the testator as well
as of the execution of the wilt.
Mr. McEnerney agreed with Judge Slack
as to t.e law. Parties who count upon a
will must comply witu the law by showing
its execution under the proper legal lorms
and by a person legally competent to
make a will; that is, a person of 21 years
of age or over and of sound mind may
make a will.
A. Van R- Paterson did not think that
the plaintiff's attorney had any right to
interrupt them in their examination of the
witness.
The court overruled the objection and
directed the witness to answer. The wit
ness replied '.bat the deceased was of sound
mind, and between GJUnd 63 years of age.
The record of the Probate Court as to
the sanity of the deceased and the probate
of the will was introduced in evidence.
The depositions of the other witnesses
to t ho will were read by Mr. Wheeler, and
the case was submitted to the court.
Judge. Siack thereupon gave judgment
in favor of the plaintiffs. This is in ac
cord with the decision rendered by him
some time ago to the effect that the trust
was invalid.
The case will be appealed to the Su
preme Court.
Judte Paterson was allowed $5000 coun
fel fees for services on behalf of the minor
heirs.
LIFE-SAVING SERVICE.
Major Blakenpy Arranging; to Secure
Karly >~ews of Shipwreck*.
In consequence of tlie several ship
wrecks along the coast recently, Major T.
J. Blakeney of the Life-saving Service is
sending out requests to all points to have
information ol wrecks and disasters for
wardri to him as quickly as possible. He
said If be had been infoimed of the wreck
oi the San Benito as soon as it took place
he would have sent a crew from this City
on a tug to the scene of the wreck.
By starting on Sunday morning the
crew, with its apparatus, could have
reached the wreck by night. all and saved
the Toor fellows in the rigging from at
leadt twelve or fourteen hours' suffering.
Although the place is 100 miles distant,
the southeast gale would have helped the
tug in its run up the coast. Major Blake
ney has sent to all the places in this vi
cinity where telephones are placed the fol
lowing notice:
Please promptly notify of wreck or other
disaster T. J. Blakeney, superintendent

His purpose in so doing is that he may

it is the crews do not have time to tele

PROTECTED BY OLD GLORY.
Americans in Turkey Were Safe Every
where When the Stars and Stripes
Were Unfurled.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Nov. 28.âSecre
tary Oiney gave to the United Associated
Presses to-day this statement:
"The State Department authorizes the
statement that the assertion made by Dr.
Cyrus Hnmmlin that American women in
Haskeni fled from massacre not finding
protection under the American flae is an
entire mistake: that the flag is neither
furled nor insulted at that point nd that
not an American man, woman or child
was at Haskeui during the massacre.
"Equally unfounded is the statement
recently made in ChicKering Hall by Miss
Dr. Frances Kimball that only the Eng
lish flag is respected in Turkey. During
the massacre at Constantinople she hur
ried by other flags and found protection
under her own flag and the escort of the
American Consul- General. She passed
through the streets where men were being
k lied by mobs and went safely under our
flag up the Bosphorus. Through scenes
of mob violence all over Turkey our fla^
and missionaries have been protected by
Turkish troops.
"We have lost by incendiary fires at but
two places, both far in the interior, the
value beinc much less than the claims of
England, France and Italy for monks and
priests killed, churches burned, houses
niliaged, and for which no indemnity has
been paid. Every peaceful American
arrested or detained lias been released on
deinaDd of the American Minister. These
demonstrations of revolutionists in Tur
key are now our chief danger so far as our
missionaries are concerned."
This departure from the recent course
practiced d.v the department in reference
to Turkish, Cuban and Venezuelan matters,
together with the fact that only yesterday
several cablegrams irom Minister Terrell
at Constantinople were made publ.c, em
phasizes the opinion prevailing in orh"c<al
circles here tbat the relations prevailing
between the United States and Turfcey
are receiving considerable attention from
the administration, and it is thought
many long standing cause* of friction be
tween the two countries are in course of
settlement.
Found a Tiec'ipitaled Body.
JERSEY CITY, N. J.. Nov. 28.â Three
boys, while gunning on the Hackensack
Meadows to-day, discovered the decapi
tated body of a man lying alongside of
the tracks of the Delaware, Lackawanna
ana Western Railway. The place where
the body was found is in Kearney Town
ship.
A large knife besmeared with blood was
lying near the body. The body was sub
sequently removed to the morgue in this
city. The police of this city are now work
ing on the case. Their theory is that the
man was murdered in the roadway and
the body subsequently secreted in the
bushes alongside the track.

PET NAMES IN
MARY'S LETTERS
Judge Coffay Orders an
Alleged Widow to Pro
duce Them.'
If Judge Hastings Wrote to Her
as His Darling Wi'e or
His P^t,
S:.e Mast Shew the Endearing: Word,
ia the Sign Manual <f the
Deceased Jurist.
Upon the application of Samuel M.
Shortridg?, attorney for the estate of S.
t'iin'on .Hastings, deceased, Judse Coffi-y
ysterday sigired a formal order requiring
Mary Viola Hastings to show by what
authority she claims to be the widow cf
the late Judge S. Clinton Hastings. The
order reads as follows:
It is hereby ordered and this does order that
Mary Viola Hastings produce an<i exhibit for
examination at the taking ot her deposition
in me office of Delmas <!fc Shortridce In the
Crocker building, in the City and County of
San Francisco on the Ist day nf Jmir, I89(j, at
2 o'clock p. m. before Kugene W. Levy, a notary
public, in and for the City and County <jf San
Francisco. State of California, in the matter of
thÂ« contest of ;hc *aid Mary Viol* Hastings to
the la-st will and testament of S. Cllntor Hast
ines. deceased, all the letters that she, the said
witness and contestant, received from the said
S. Clinton lla>tingt, deceased, addressed to
hen-elf by him from the yÂ«nr 1877 to th- time
of hisd^uth, to wit: lhelÃtli day of February
1893, and which are now in her possession of
uikkt her control, and in particular all sucn
letters :.d<lrt'Â«sen to her as "My Dear Wife " or
"Wife," or -Darlirg Wiie," or "Mary," or'"My
Pet." or any oiher endearing or a'ffectionnte
teim.
It will be remembered that Mary Viola
Hastings deposed bt-fora Notary Public
Levy that shcha.l in her possession a curt
load of lettersâ "as much as a mule could
haulâ written by Judge Hastings to her
in many of which letters he ;iddre.Â«sed her
i>s "Aly dear wife, 1 '-Wife, " "Darling
wifÂ»," -Mary." "My pet" and other sweet
and affectionate names. She was asked
to produce the letter.-, but she reiused lo
fast, yet but two favorites landed the
coin.
The mile and a sixteenth handicap was
supposed to have btjen the featu r o of the
card, but it resulted in a tame affair.
Nebuchadnezzer, who was let irt at ninety
seven poutr.l>, took matters as he Â». leased
to the stretch, then came on and won
easily from Sir Play. t!Â»e second choice.
It was a very i>oor Lianiiicau. The win
ner's time was 1:48^.
Grandezia was made a 13 to 10 favorite
for the openine, five and a halt furlong
dash, and after leading to the bend for
home died away.
In a hard drive Alazan, a 4 to 1 shot,
beat Torpedo a head. Torpedo lacked
gamenes?.
A miscellaneous lot of platers faced the
flag in the second event, a six furlong
spin.
Allahabad was made a 3 to 2 cWice, but
af!er getting away well and fulling back to
the rear and again making a fine run from
the rear was ben ten out two lengths by
Zamloch, a 12 to 1 shot.
fid Purser's Tempestuous furnished the
surprise in the third race at five furlongs.
Midlight was made a 9 to 10 favorite,
but barely snecetfded in getting third
money. In a hand drive Clawson got
Tempestuous In a winner, a nose in front
of Sngaifoot. The favorite was third.
Salisbury 11, the fast son of Racine, had
a walkover in the fifth event over seven
furlongs. Seiting his own pace lie won
under double wraps from McLight in the
fast timeof 1:27>4.
Geraidine at tirst opened favorite for
the last event, over six furlongs, but re
ceded in the betting, finally closing equal
choice with Sir Richard. The old mare
sulked and was never in it. Peril getting a
running start was always in front, and at
the finish wou by half a length from the
fast coming Elmer F.
do so without an order of court The let
ters, being of importance in the case, the
court made the order.

B. F. HUDELSON
BEHIND THE BARS
Woodworth, a Friend of
Blackmailer Marshall,
Causes the Arrest. ,
Is Charged With Libeling the
Attorney" Who Came Frcm
Canada.
He Gives Bail in the Sum of $1000.
Outgrowth of the Attempt toExtort
Money From J. D. Spreckels.
D. B. Woodworth, the good friend of
Blackmailer Marshall and Donald M.
Ross, has come to the surface again, after
a lone absence from the public eye. He
is the very cautious person who went to
The Call office one nigbt in April last
with H. t\ Marshall when that enierpris
ing divinity student tried to set $55,000
from John D. Spreckels for a mine whicti
Marshall confessed was either a myth or
of no value. He it was who sat in the
cuter office and who, instead of helping
Marshall to save his precious teeth when
Mr. Spreckels arose and smote him and
them, tarried not upon the order of his
goinÃ, but fled incontinently from the
place of danger.
Woodworth had B. F. Hudelson, presi
dent of the A. P. A., arrested for libel
yesterday afternoon, he alleging in his
complaint that an account of the attempt
to blackmail Mr. SprecKels which ap
peared in Hudelson's paper misrepre
sented'him most prievously.
Hudelson was not long in prison before
he was bailed out by two friends, who
gave bonds In the sum of $1000. He then
said that he did not know what was in the
complaint against him, and by advice of
his counsel reiused lo discuss the matter.
In reeard to the arrest, Woodworth said:
"This whole story of Hudelson's concern
ing the part he said I took in tbe pro
posed sale of the Plumos County placer
mine to John D. Spreckels" is a libel and
a slander on me, and a most malicious
one. I was out of the City from June Gto
August 30 last, and did not know any
thing about ail this till I returned. The
burden or proof is on him. but the reason
that 1 have not had Hudelxon arrested
before is that my chain of evidence was
not complete.
"The fact is," he continued, "that I
knew nothing of the offer of the mine to
John D. SprecKels. I had an option on
this mine and Huddleson somehow found
it out. He said he could pet me $50,000 on
it. As to where or how he was going to
get it I knew nothing.
"Do you think I would let the charge of |
bein^ a blackmailer or extortionist against i
me remain unanswered or undefended? I
Hudelson is a scoundrel and he shall
answer for what he has said and caused to
be published about me. My mining
proposition was a legitimate one through
out.
"1 have the original proposition as it
was drawn up. which shows that it con
tained a proposition to put in sixty
stamp?. It is lucky I found it.
"On November 18, in F. D. Brandon's
oftv c and in the presence of Mr. Bran
don and bis clerk, R. W. Borrough,
M. T. Brewer, State secretary of
the order, said he came In to ask
about the truthfulness of the affidavit
of April 3; that 1 cheerfully gave him
two copies of the atlidavit; tnat I
made no threats concerning the affidavits
or anything else; that he exonerated me
in kvery way in regard to-anything and
everything, and that I had never done
anything that would not be done by a
high minded and honorable man.
"Hndelson said also that Ross or he
had to get off the advisory board of the
order. He had Ross examined by the
b>ard and they exonerated him. After
ward Hudelson had three members, com
pris ng a committee, take up the matter
asainst RosÂ», and they signed a report
suspending him for thirty days."
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 28.â Rev. B. F.
Hudelson was seen at his residence at
Golden Gate this evening. In reference
to his arrest in San F/ancisco to-day Mr.
Hndelson says t at he has not yet seen a
copy of the complaint, but presumes that
his arrest is the result of certain articles
that appeared in the Standard some time
last June.
"In these articles," said Mr. Hudelson,
"occuri the statement that Marshall,
Woedworth and Ross had threatened to
ruin me unless I would go to Mr. Spreckels
and procure for them $55,000."
Asked what he proposed to do in the
matter he said that he had had no time to
consider the situation yet, "but," he con
tinued, "I will expose as far as I can the
whole thing and all connected with it. I
mean to tignt it to tne bitter end.
"I am glad this has happened, as it will
give me an opportunity to clear np more
ihan one mystery."
JJHe W as very indignant atjjtbe time se
lected for his arrest. "It was after busi
ness hours and Saturday afternoon, a time
when it would be difficult, if cot impossi
ble, for me to ob'.aui bail.
"The intention evidently was to keep
me In prison over Sunday."
Mr. Hudelson said that he was not at all
afraid of the outcome, but welcomed the
occurrence as an opportunity for him 'o
make his position clear to the eyes of the
world.
ITALY'S TOMB SPIDER.
A Thing: s<> O( l (1 Thut Ir la Relieved to
J- M&t Only in Imagination.
The people of Italy believe in thf> exist
ence of a wonderful creature which, for
the want of a better name, is called the
tomb spider. The entomologists know
nothing of this queer beast, and declare
that it only exists in the fancy of the su
perstitious persons and those whose curi
osity or business makes it necessary for
thorn to explore old ruins, tomb?, cata
combs, etc. According to the i opuiar ac
count the tomb spider is of a pure white
color, has wings like those of a bat, a
dozen horrid croofced legs and a body
three or four times the sizj of the largest
tropical American tarantula.
The accounts ot this queer insect and
his OUt-of-the-way places of abode are by
no means common, and on that account
the information concerning him, which
we will be able to give the "curious," is
very meager. Any Italian will tell you
that sucu a creature exists, however, and
that he is occasionally met with in old
mines and caverns, as well as in tombs
and subterranean rums. The London
Saturday Review has an article from a
correspondent who was present when j
some Roman workmen unearthed a
church of the fifth century. He says:
"We were standing by one of the heavy
pillars that had originally supported the j
roof, when something flashed down from >.
the pitchy darkness overhead and paused j
full in the candle-light beside us, at aboui !
a 1 vel with our eye's. It was distinctly as i
vi-ible as a tiling could be at a distance of
three fee?, and appeared to be an insect
about half the size of a man's fist, white
as wax ana with its many long le^s
gathered in a bunch as it crouched on the
stone. * * *
"Our guide had seen, or at least heard of
this uncanny insect of iil omen before, but
was by no means reconciled to its pres
ence, as his notions proved. He glanced
around uncomfortably for a moment and
then movedÂ»away, we foilowing. It seems
really a bit queer, "6ut it is said tbat the
.strongest nerves jiive way in the presence
of ihis insert of such ghostly mien. Even
to-day this uncanny apparition is Said to
be an unclassified monster â an eternal
mystery. When the* grave spider is en
countered by those opening tombs and
vaults it is thought to b*a 'sign' of death
to one of the workmen or some member of
his family. "-pair Mall Gazette. .

received a handsome compensation, but
this has no effect on Oakland managers.

AT the last meeting of the league, at
; which the electioit should have been held,
the Pondinkys swarmed into the hall in
full force. They^were not expected, and
so no idea could be formed us to why they
suddenly manifested such'preat imerest in
the Young Men's League. Now it is
ttfoutbt that thtf secret is out and several
member? openly 'declare that the Pon
dinkys are going to make a light for Coun

for this idea. Sam V. Hall and Mr. Towle
live in the name ward, and it is but natural
that now Mr. Hall has his heart's desire

The election of president of the Ipngue

tbo interest in the good-natured figin be

creasing daily. Mr. Pulciler's friends do
not hesitate to say that unless their man
be elected the ieacue will speedily become
a personal machine, to be used in tne in

this in tuto. However, the threat is being
made thut if the league as an organization

Mr. Gil pin has asked for such accommo

Every evening Mr. Gilpin has to put his

The Treasurer does not appreciate being
escorted by a policeman every evening
from his office to ihe bank, but there is no
alternative, as there is no place in the
City Hall where the money can be- kept.
Every few mouths prisoners liiul no diffi

OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 28.â The Ad

was towed into Oakland harbor last night.
Forty-three days ago the vessel left the
Marshall Islands after making the usual
trip through the Society group, Tongaos,
Fijis and New Hebrides. Captain Gra

The Pitcairn was built in 1890. and on

made her- first trip to. the island from
which she takes her name. Since that
time She has male periodic*! voyages in
the interest o! the Seventh-day Advent

the next in:ercolieciate game to be settled
is between St. Mary's College and Santa

the two well-known Catholic educational
ir.mitutions of this coast-will meet on the
gridiron Saturday, December 12, to battle
for their alma mater and uphold their
colors. Both teams have been training
for the contest during the last two
months, and as the greatest rivalry exists
between the two colleges and they both
possess excellent material, one of the
hardest and best-fought games of the sea
son may be looked for.
The students of both colleges and their
affiliated schools are displaying great en
thusiasm over- the cbdnces of their re
spective teams, and a game that will be
notable for great noise and a crowd is
surely a fact. Captain Mogan of St.

Wyckoff, is working his team hard.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO GALL, SNDAY, NOVEMBER 2U9, 1896.
THINKING OVER
THEIR DEFEAT
Berkeley Players Speculat
ing as to How They
Lost the Game.
Some Blame the Coach, While
the. Majority Uphold
His Work.
Hunting for Some One on Whom the
Responsibility Can Bs Most
Easily Shifted.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 28.â Now that
the great annual intercollegiate football
game is over and gone, and the sting of
defeat is gradually dying away, the
players and their friends have begun to
reflect a little and to try to find out how
Berkeley really happened to lose the
game.
In the case of every contest where there
is a decision the losing side is always sure
to look about for somebody on whom to
lay the blame. Just so in the present one.
Half a dozen or more reasons are ad
vanced for Berkeley's sad defeat. Some
throw the whole blame on Butterworth,
some say that the men did not work hard
enough; others maintain that the team
did not have the full support of the
students, and thus were lacking in spirit,
while still others declare that the material
at hand was not equal to that at Stanford.
The burden of the blame would nat
urally fall upon the coach, no matter how
competent cr painstaking he might be.
W hile it is generally conceded that Butter
worth did not give the time and attention
to the team that he might have done, sti-1
his work with them 2hi< year seems to
have compared favorably with that of last
season. During neither year did he give
the team the constant attention that tuey
received at the hands of Gill or Heffelfin
giT. Last year it was whispered around
that the coach was paying too much at
tention to society and to other matters
entirely foreign to football, but when the
news was spread abroad that Manager
Reinhardt was thinking strongly of secur
ing some other man this year, "a great
howl went up from the football men and
student body.
So strong was the sentiment in Butter
worth's favor that during the campaign
for managership, when Taylor and Rein
oardt were up, an argument which was
offered against the latter was that he did
not favor Butterworth. Thi3 one thing is
said to have lost him many votes. The
impression tt.at the great Yule fullback
had made on the Berkeley team and the
>tudonts in general, because of his snapyy
methods of coachmg, was sufficient "to
favor hi* certain return, notwithstanding
his affinity for society and his alienation
from the team.
This favorable attitnde toward Butter
worth continued until Berkeley had been
defeated. Then a few of h.s enemies, in
order to make some ~ort of an excuse for
the walk- .ver, turned and cast the biame
on the coach.
Hardly a day passed during the practice
season that some one was not heard to
say: "We will win this year if we ever
do."
The reasons for this belief were that
with two such men as Butterworth and
Nott to direct the work of the team, as
nijaihst Cro-s, the single instructor of the
Palo Alto men, Berkeley should come out
on top if any good was to con.o from ex
perienced coachers. Butierworth was
the hhru salaried officer, he bore the
cognomen of Coach and he received
nearly all the honor for training the men,
and now the blame for losing the day is
laid by some at his door. Several mem
bers of the team who were interviewed to
day, while admitting that he might have
suent more eneray on them, uphold the
coach, and take the burden of the defeat
upon themselves.
Said one of the players this afternoon:
"We were too light for the Palo Alto men
to begin with, and then we suffered because
it was necessary to shift us about in or
der to make up the best team. We did
not get the practice together that we
should have bad for the big game. This
lightness of the piayers and "the shifting
about was no fault of Butterworth's. The
same .thing would have happened if we
had had forty of the best coachers in
America at our side. That be did the best
he could with the material on hand 1 have
not the least doubt. We frared all along
that we could not hold Stanford's line,
and it proved true. Our backs were far
superior to theirs in akiW, but what could
they do with a weak line for support?
"It may not be generally Known, but
Carr, our center, entered the game weigh
ing fast 158 pounds, which is 44 pounds
less than Williams is reported to have
weighed. Carr did nobly against big
'Heff,' but ot course could not hold him
all the time. It is a fact that Carr had
only six days' actual training at center.
"Then again Walthail, our ielt guard,
though he understood his position, having
piayetl last year, had only a week's pra<"
tice the wnoie season. It waÂ« through
these positions that Stanford made the
greater part of her gnraes. From these two
cases alone the fart that we did not have
the material for a crack team is proved.
I deplore very much that this conversa
tion about the incompetency of the coach
has arisen, because I think that it is an
injustice to the man. I have no personal
feeling In the matter whatever, but I want
to see Buiterworth given a "squire deal."
Barely Escaped Death.
BERKELEY, Cal.^ Nov. 28. -Tom
Nealon, a bartender in the employ or Dan
Landre^an, a West Berkeley saloon man
had a narrow escape from death by fire
early this morning. He was aÂ«oep In his

was nearly suffocated. Being In a dazed
condition when he reached the porch he
dia not have strength to control himself
and consequently fell to the cement aide
beiow, a distance of fifteen feet.
His hip wai seriously injured by the
fall, and his hair singed almost completely
off by the liames. The tire is supposed to
have had its origin in the kitchen stove in
the rear of the saloon. The building,
which was a two-story frame, was burned
completely, and the only thing in it that
was saved was the bar counter. All of
Nealon's clothing was also destroyed. The
structure and contents were valued at
about $2500, with an insurance of $1000.

MAJOR WATERS' DILEMMA
The Tall Cake-Walker Did Not
March for Patriotism but
for Pay.
Now His Demand for a Settlement
Only M.ets an Adaman*
line G z?.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. rS, 181Â»6. J
Major Waters declares that the lusionists
of Alameda County owe h.m ?15, for
which he threatens to brine suit if his
claim be not speedily liquidated.
The major is the jtallest colored gentle
man in town. He wears the louaest
clothes, has figured in an interesting
divorce suit as the defendant; he won a
long linen duster at a cakewalk, and yet
after ail these honors he now declares he
is in the condition which should have been
occupied at this time, according to the
fusionists, by Major McKiniey. To use
the major's own vernacular, he is "in d*Â»
soup."
The expression "in de soup" has a most
peculiar meaning to the major. During
the campaign, dressed in his prize duster
and wearing a si|k hat, decorated with
star* and stripes, the major carried a
monster transparency in the fusion pa
rade. The major is nearly 7 feel high,
and he and tue transparency were the
most prominent features in the 10 to 1
pageant. On the transparency were
painted these words, "Where will Mc-
Kmley be November 4?â in the soup."
Now the major thinks that it was bad
enough to carry that transparency, and
worse st.li, in the light of succeeding
events, to be con.inually reminded that
he has taken Major MrKinley's place. But
he boldly asserts that to decline to pay
him the $15 which he earned in the most
poignant thorn in his crown of bitterness.
"It was this way," said the major, "peo
ple always thought I was a Republican;
but politics is $ legitimate business, and I
didn't carry that banner for patriotism. I
carried it for what there was in it, more
than fir what was on it; now 1 find that j
the two were very much alike. I do not
wish to be forced to take tnis claim of
mine into the court, but 1 do think that it
should be paid. Any political party that
hires me in the future will be required to
act in the snme way as the tenant of our
wealtny landlordâ pay in advance."
A peculiar little story accounts for tte
major's conveision from Republicanism
to Bryatiism. A few months ago ihe
major figured in a Cakewalk at the Mac
donoaxh Theater. It bo happened that
there were seventeen comvetitorsi, and the
major's number was 16, which was hung
on a large card on his manly bre;ist.
"Now," said the major to himself, "it is a
case of 1G to 1, and if I win I . m a 16 to 1
man till something hotter offers." The
mnjor did win; he marched with the 16 to
1 crowd, and now he swiars by his whole
life thai he has no more faith in omens or
Bryan ism.

Something Abcut the Vast Quantity
of Literary Matter Sent Out in

Perry S. Heath, who was chief of the
literary bureau of the Republican National
Committee, with headquarters at Chicago,
durine the recent political campaign, ar
rived here iast night and is at the Palace.
He is accompan-ed by Mrs. Heath and
Mrs. M. B. Con way of Cincinnati.
It was announced by telegraph from the
East about two weeks apo t at Chairman
Hanna, seeing that the silver men were
going to keep up the campaign of educa
tion for the next four years, had decided
to keep up the Republican fight to offset
it. To this end it was announced that
Mr. Heath would go West, visit the silver
and gold districts and gather statistical
and other information which would be of
use to offset the work of the silver men.
Mr. Heath, however, says that some wild
stories have lately been sent out about the
object of his visit.
"1 have been trying to get to California
for a long time," he said, "but till now

something always turned up to prevent
it. The nearest I ever got here was one
time when I was out to Portland. Then I
intended to come here last spring, but the
cam] ai.-n coming on I could not do ;t. I
took charge of the Cincinnati Commercial-
Gazette when Murat Halstead retired and
was very busy with it until May, when I
sold out. Right at that time I expected
to come here, but got to work at the head
of the Bureau of Publicity and Promotion.
Then 1 hud so much to do that coming
Weft was not to be thought of.
"Of course, while I am on the trip I
will look up some matters in referenoe to
gold iind silver. I shall go down into
Mexico, and while there will study up the
suDject and learn by actual observation
the effects of lree silver coinage.
"The National Republican Committee
had two expeditions down there thi-year,
aud the result of their investigations was
widely published, but perhaps more lully
in the Chicago dailies than anywhere else.
We issued some plates too containing
the-e tacts and from this matter was pub
lished in different parts of the country.
"From the Republican headquarters in
Chicago, Washington ana New York we
circulated during the recent campaign
about 300.000,000 documents of difterelit
kinds. Of these 10 per cent were on the
tariff and the remainder nearly solely on
the money question. Besides the*-e we
circulated about 20,000.000 conies of news
paper supplement*. Eighty-eight carloads
of documents were sent out from Chicago
and'thirty from Washington. More lit
erary stuff was sent out this year than
auriiiÃ all the canipaiens hitherto."

has had fou: teen yems' experience as a

A French inventor haÃ devised a curious
electrical alarm for infants. It consists of
a micropuonic circuit-breaker placed near
the head of the child in its cradle and
connected with an electric beA through
the medium of a relay. A cry from the
child will actuate the microphonic circuit
breaker and will thus cause the bell to

SCHOOLS WILL

The Board of Education
Defies the Health De
partment.
Some of the Directors Were in
Favor of Censuring the
Medicos.
Temporary Repairs Will Be Made at
Onceâ Other Ammunition is
Yet in Store.
Resolved, That this board cjrder the Marshall
Primary, Mis-siou Grammar and Everett Gram
mar schools opened as usual on Tuesday
morning next. December 1, and rhftt the mem
bers of the Board of Health and their officers
be i vited to visit the said &ehoois for the pur
pose of Ins] ection.
Thus the Board of Education hurled
defiance at the Board ol Health yester
day, as a result of the recent action of the
latter body in ordering the schools named
closed. - ,
The School Directors held a special ses
sion to hear the report of the special com
mittee appointed to confer with the
health authorities.
Dr. Clinton, chairman, reported that the
Health Department was determined to
close the schools and that it was in the
hands of the Board of Education whether
to obey the order or ncft. He stated tli at ie
would cost $15,000 to do the work exacted
by the Board of Health and that the
School Board had no such sum available
for the purpose.
Superintendent Babcock made a motion
that the board order the schools opened
immediately and kept open, the depart
ment to make whatever repairs it could
with the money on hand.
Dr. Clinton said that he thought the
proper procedure would be to repair the
planking and outhouses objected to by
the Board of Health and invite the latter
body to inspect the schools. If the mcdi- â 
cal men still insisted on ordering the
schools closed it would be time for the
school beard to take the bull by the
horns.
President Scott suggested that the board
should close the schools in deference to
the health euthoritips and then go to the
Supervisors for a special appropriation to
do the required work.
"We cannot depend on what this Board
of Health will do," said Superintendent
Babcock. *'it has done'some of the rawest
things ever seen in this City. One i-chool
was neglected where sewerage from private
property was running into its grounds,
bu* of course the Health Dep.irtmentcould
nor see that. Another hchool, the John
Swett, has an offensive stable alongside it,
but of course the Board of Health could
not see that." *
Director McElroy was for c&mpromisa
or war, and was telling why he was whfcn
Director Knox brouehi forth a law which â¢
gives the Board of Health the power 'to
abate nuisances on public property. The
same law says that the Supervisors must
allow the nionÂ°y for the improvements out
of the general fund, that the Auditor
must sign the warrants and the 'treasury
pay them.
Director Scott was in favor of censuring
the Board of Health in the circumstances,
but it was finally decided to let the resolu
tion quoted pass and reserve further
action until the Board of Health is heard
from.

CALLED EAST BY
MAJOR McKINLEY
The First of the California
Contingent to Be
Honored.
George R. Morse, a Nephew of
the President-Elect, the
Fortunate One.
Was Chief of Staff ia the Big Repub
lican Parade â Booked for a
Fat Position.
The first of the California contingent of
stanch Republicans to be honored by a
call from President-elect McKinley left a
few days ago for Canton, Ohio, and is now
enjoying the hospitality of the Ohio
statesman anti talking over matters con-
Tiected with the patronage which Major
SicKinley will dispense in this State.
George R.Morse is the fortunate in
dividual, and it is certain that he will re
ceive a fat position as soon as the cham-
George R. Morse, a Nephew of
President-Elect McKinley, Who
Has Been Called East to Confer
â¢ With the Ohio Sta tesman About
California Federal Patronage.
pi"n of gold and protection is installed in
the highest office in the gift of the Nation.
Mr. Morse* has been prominent in San
Francisco business and political circles for
some time "past, and during the campaign
.fought valiantly for the success of Major
Me Kin ley.
When the giant parade of the Republi
can forces of tnis City, In which 32,000
â¢ men marched, was arranged, Mr. Morse I
was chosen qhief of staff, and his !
efforts aided materially in mating the |
demonstration tne great success that it
certainly was.
Soon after the wires had flashed across
the country tire news that tbe Republican
â  party was overwhelmingly triumphant
Mr. Morse received an urgent telegram
from the President-elect to go on to Can- j
ton and comer with the standard-bearer j
of the part}'. He departed with his w.fe
a few 'days "ago and will probably remain |
'at Canton for a month belore returning to
his home in this Cny.
In addition to being a heavy-weight in
the Republican ranks Mr. Morse bears the
distinction of twing a nephew of the Pres
ident-elect, and this circumstance will
probably cause his relative to tender him
a more important position than would
otherwise be the case.
The fortunate relative of a President
did not fcnowwhen he left for the East I
â whether he would be given a Federal j
berth in California or whether the posi- I
tion would be in Washington, and his
father, Edward A. Morse, was left in
charge of his Baker-street home and of |
' his little daughter, who remains in this !
City pendins her parents' return.
Mr. Morse Sr. recently resigned his posi
tion as treasurer of Frisbee, Risaon & Co.'s
law and collection atency, and will also
be given a comfortable berth in some of
the Government offices.

IRA P. RANKIN'S NOTES.
Claim* for 935,500 Against His : Estate
Beius Pressed by ihe Wife's ,
Estate. \
The business affairs of the late Ira P.
Rankin continue from time to time to
come up for discussion and settlement in
tbe Superior Court, although he has been
deed more than a year.
The latest phase is evolved in the suit
of Augustus Tilden, administrator of tbe
estate of Caroline A. B. Rankin, deceased,
vs. tJ. E. LaÃue, administrator of the es
tate of Ira P. Rankin, deceased, for $35,
--500isaidto be due on promissory notes
made as senior member oT the firm of Ran
kin:, Brayton & Co. at different times from
1879 to 1874.
li> the complaint it is set forth that in
1882 Ira P. Rankin was appointed admin
istrator of the estate of his wife, the said
Caroline A. B. Rankin, but that he failed
and neglected to collect for his wife's
estate the moneys due from himself and
his tirm. After Mr. Rankin's death the
administrator of Mrs. Ranktn's estata at
tempted to collect tiie amount due, but
all lun claims were rejected by the admin
istrator of Rankin'a estate. Hence this
suit.
KRULL FAMILY TROUBLE.
A Mother Sues Her childrenâ Sued by
v < .iml in;. i iii Congregation.
A family controversy has been brought
from the Potrero to the Superior Court
for settlement. Mrs. Lydia Krull, widow
of the late Ernst Georg Nicolai Krnll,
complains that Axel Krull, Lydia "M.
Krull, Lum Krull and George Krull, chil
dren of said E. G. N. Krull, lay claim to
an interest in that certain piece of prop
erty on Alabama street, near Twenty-fifth,
and as Mrs. Krull asserts that is her sepa
rate property, bought with her own money
and deeded to her by J. 8. Porteous, she
asks the court to make htr sole owner of
the premises, and that the defendanis be
debarred from claiming an interest
therein.
Another suit in which the Krull family
is interested was also tiled late la*t even
ing. It is entitled Andrew J. Wohlander
and O. Groenberg against Mrs. Krull and
the Kruil children mentioned above.
The complaint recites that several years
ago a religious congregation known as
Our Savior Scandinavian Evangelical
Lutneran Church purchased a lot on How
ant street, near Thirteenth, to be used for
church purposes, and that the congrega
tion has ever since remained in posses
sion of the premises. The deed to the
property was made to Wohlander, Groen
berg and the late Ernst Krull as trustees
for the church, bince Krull's death the
members of his family claim an interest
in the property, and the surviving trus
tees have sued to have the congregation's
title declared valid.
THE POOR TREATED FREE
The College of Physicians and
Surgeons Opens a Charity
Clinic.
Wcmen in Sealskin S cques Apply,
bat Treatment of All Able to
Pay Refused.
Some time ago the management of the
City and County Hospital lound it neces
sary to close the free outdoor clinic for
the poor, as there were no funds with
which to defray the expenses.
'ihis would have proved a real hardship
to tbe suffering poor had it not been met
b>' the opening, about the same time, of a i
free clinic by the College of Physicians j
and Surgeons. The college building is j
located on Howard street, near Fourth, in j
the center of a large population.
The deserving poor are treated here free
of charge from 9 o'clock in the morning i
until 6 o'clock in the evening by physi- '
cians who stand in the front lank of "the j
profession in this City.
Dr. Wlnsiow Anderson, dean of the j
faculty, speaking last evening of the clinic j
;taid: "Since we opened the free clinics
they have been very well patronized in
deed during every day and every hour of
the day from 9 until 6. Sufferers from
every manner of complaint come to us.
"No person is ever charged or allowed
to pay under any circumstances at tbe
college, although very often people apply
who are well able to do so. The ladies in
sealskin sacaues are politely advised that
they cannot be treated there. Do any
such apply? Yes, indeed, but whenever
by any sign of dress or bearing it is
deemed they are able to pay for treatment
they are refused at the college.
"The members of the faculty are all spe
cialists, and of course the charity patients
tret the benelit of the best professional ad
vice and treatment."
The following physicians compose the
faculty of the College of Physicians and
burgeons: S. M. Mouser, M.D., president

A Stepfather Reprimanded in Court for
Having His Two Stepsons Arrested.
John Joy and James Joy, 19 and 18 years
of age respectively, appeared before act
ing Police Judge Kerrigan yesterday
morning to answer a charge of vagrancy.
The boys were arrested at the instance
of Carl Peterson, 522 Twenty-first street,

the boys would not work and were always
keeping company at night with bad com
panions.

verely reprimanded Peterson for his con
duct. As the elder boy confessed that he

THE STAGE HAS
A NEW ASPIRANT
Mrs. Romualdo Pacheco's
Niece Studying the
Drama.
She Is Now Filling a Minor Part
in "Humanity" at the
Columbia.
Miss Mac Roberson Thinks She Will
Select the Musical Name of
Anita Pacheco
The stage has acquired a new aspirant
for histrionic honors in the person of Misa
Mac Roberson, the niece of Mrs. Roinu-
MISS MAE ROBERSON.
j aldo Facbeco. Miss Roberson is full of <
! enthusiasm and declares she faces the up
hill struggle with a clear conception of
the work â constant and arduous work â
: that success in the profession demands; ,
1 and also with a determination to abne- â 
I gate self wholly for art. "The loundation j
must be laid," she said last evening, "and 'â 
then I can only hope to win favor before j '
i the footlights. How far I may succeed is {
I a thine for future consideration."
Mi-s Roberson is a pupil of the Colum
j bia Theater School of Dramatic Art and
I has been given a minor part in "Hu
| manity," now presented by Joe Grisraer
and Phoebe Davies. While her name does ]
not appear on (he bills that fact goes to i
prove her evident desire to learn every <
detail of the stage. Manager Friedlander â¢
says that the work she is now doing is
more for the purpose of getting a thorough .
practical knowledge of the stage and
learning the art of make-up as well as j
gaining confidence and acquiring self
repose.
She has been with the company for two I
weeKs and is said to be very graceful on i
the stage, in addition to which she reads I
deliehtfully and is the fortunate possessor |
lof a beautiful voice. Mr. Grismer has |
j stated that before he closes his enzage- ;
! men t here he in'ends to give tier a part of !
some consequence and then no doubt her j
numerous friends will give her a really I
encouraging reception.
It was at the instance of Mrs. Pacheco, I
her aunt, that Miss Roberson took to the I
stage. The young lady is a thorough C.ili
fornian, in fact, she belongs to the soil, j
Her maternal grandmother was a mem- j I
ber of the distinguished Carrillo family of I
San Diego and her uncle is ex-Governor i
Romualdo Pacheco. Her father was an
English gentleman.
General Vallejo married a sister of her
grandmother. Ho she comes of the best
Spanish stock of California. Miss .Rober
son was born in San Luis Obispo, but
came to San Francisco when quite a child
and has since lived here.
Personally she is a graceful little lady,
quite engaging in conversation and gifted
i with an attractive stage presence. Her
Spanish heritage is most noticeable in
large dark eyes and dark uair, but yet her
features have more of the Anglo-Saxon j
type, being marked especially with
strength and intellectuality. She brings
to the stage one advantage, that of a soft
ness of speech in which the vowel sounds
are dominant, and this is clearly the influ
ence of the Spanish tongue, so musical in
women's mouths.
She told her own story last evening
: with a modesty that denoted the student
! feeling.
"My aunt, Mrs. Pacheco, was anxious
that I should go on the stage," she said,
"and also that I should succeed. At her
aavice I took up study of the drama four |
months ago. I intend to remain in San
Francisco with the Columbia school for
j six months at least, and then â well I may
take an engagement in the East" â this
i with some diffidence. "It depends, you
know, on what success I make. I have
my iaeals and shall. strive to reach them.
One lias to overcome so much in the be
ginning. So far my work has been in Del
i sarte, in dancing, pantomime and little
i plays, but gradually I will pass beyond
them into i.igher parts.
, "Study in the school requires close at- j
â¢ tention nearly all day long and I assure
i it is not easy work. Now I'm preparing
; for "The New South,' only I don't take j
, part in it much. For the* reason that I j
have a voice to sing I am singing the
\ Southern medleys in the play. Always
since I was a little girl I played the guitar
i and sang Spanish songs. They are very
pretty, and people, particularly Ameri
-1 cans, enjoy them very much. I should
iike to have a part where I could sing one
or two of tbe?e songs.
"Mrs. Pacheco has written a play, 'The
1 Leading Man,' for Mr. Goodwin. She is
â¢ now in New York with four plays, which
' will be submitted to prominent actors.
; Her new plays are: 'A Cowboy Earl,'
'American Assurance' (a revision of
â¢Nothing But Money'), which did not
take well; 'A Knickerbocker Family'
and 'The Governor and His Wife. 1 Id
the Governor there is a great deal of orig-
ihality â points which she picked up while
at i he capital.
"I have not yet taken a stage name.
I've been thinking of taking Anita
Pacheco. How do you like it? But I will
submit it to my aunt and whatever she
says I'm sure will please me."
CAUSES OF MANY DEATHS.
Six Inquests Held on Persons Who
Passed Out Suddenly.
Coroner Hawkins was kept busy for a
while yesterday holding inquests on cases
where death had resulted from violence
during the week. A verdict of suicide was
returned in the case of William Henry
Johnson, who on the 19th inst. was found
hanging by a rope to a rafter in his uncle's
stable, at 31 OaK Grove avenue. He was a
butcher, 41 years of age and a native of
New Hampshire.
A similar verdict was returned in the
case of Joseph Giacomini, a bartender
from Salinas. On the 19th he was found
near the bandstand in the park suffering
from morphine poisoning, from which he
died a few hours later in the Receiving
Hospital.
Frederick D. Stevens' death was ac
cidental, according to the verdict of the
Coroner's jury. Stevens lived at 1:726
Howard Btreet. On the 20th he was at
work as bookkeeper for Joseph Fredericks
& Co., on the San Francisco Gas Light
Company's wharf, at the foot of|Buchanan
street, when a derrick fell upon him,
causing internal injuries irons which he
died. The jury did not consider that any
one was to blame in the premises.
On the night of November 18 David W.
Sheehan, a laborer, living at 313 a Clemen
tina street, fell down into the hold ot the
steamer San Bias, breaking nis neck. A
verdict of accidental death was returned.
.Last week the body of an unknown man
was washed ashore between Fort .Point
and Bakers Beacu. The features were
past recognition. The jnrv was unable to
tell whether the man's death was due to
accident, suicide or foul play.

LEGISLATORS FAVOR
THE LABOR BILLS
Commissioner Fitzgerald
Believes the Laws
Will Pass.
Advices From Different Cities
Assure Him of Generous
Support.
Los Angeles, Sacramento, Alameda
County and San Francisco
Stand for Labor.
During the last few days very encourag
ing letters have been received by Labor
Commissioner Fitzgerald. They cont&in
information concerning the labor, laws
which will be submitted at the next ses
sion of the Legislature, and also on the
altitude of Senators and Assemblymen
with respect to these laws in the various
centers of population in California.
Judging from the statements set forth
in these communications the Labor Com
missioner says that he i 3 fully satisfied that
the Legislature will pass the proposed
laws in tbe interest of labor. This, he ad
mitted, was a pleasing conviction after his
efforts in preparing the different measures
in behalf of labor.
"I have received a letter from the Labor
Council of Sacramento, which says that
the members elected from that county to
both houses will support the labor bills.
I got another Jetter irom Los Angeles in
forming me that the representatives from
there were in favor of this legislation.
Two of tne men nominated by tbe Los An
geles Labor Council for the Legislature
wÂ«*re elected. Other letters have been re
ceived from Vallejo and Qrass Valley,
stating that the men there are pledged to
support the laws framed ior the beneht of
labor.
"Nearly all Alameda County is pledged
and the remainder are friendly. Twelve
out of the eighteen Assemblymen in Ban
Francisco and all but one Senator are
pledged to support the labor laws as
amended by tne labor convention.
"So, as near as I can judge, there is a
majority in both houses pledged to stand
by labor in this tight. Now, I think that
is a very nice thin*:.
"It is the intention of all the labor
unions of California to call a mass-meet
ing or convention in Sacramento if there
should appear to be any danger of the
labor bills falling through. This conven
tion would then make a stir and its pow
erful influence would make itself felt dur
ing the session of the Legislature, and if
any representative in me Legislature
bucks againsi the bills he will be eaten up
should he ever again run for office.
â¢'Labor is better organized in California
at the pre6ent time than in any otiier
State of the Union. The unions are pull
ing well together; they are united. Los
Aneeles has 4500 men organized, and the
number of organized men in San Fran
cisco must be close to 30,000.
"The intention of the San Francisco
labor unions is to organize all councils on
the first of next year in one central body
and then to wort together for the purpose
of aiding and supporting all public move
ments tending to the beneht of labor."

VIE WITH PROUD
NEW YORK IN HER GREAT
EQUINE DISPLAY.
TRE next thing is the horse show. I
While the laws and rule.s tbat will
govern every thins connected with it
"are., inflexible and as numerous as those
which have made the MeJes and Persians
handy to quote as "examples there wiil be
o nothing severe about it.
Â°Â° True, there are rules on judging and
to judges, reneral rules and
regulations to be observed by exhibitors
â¢ and rules relating to the jumping classes,
etc., all neatly printed in red type in a
prospectus, but- the thousands who will
attend tÂ£e show will never know anything
oÂ° aDout them.
The judges wilrhave the right to ride or
drive any of the contesting horses when
it may be Considered necessary to test
their, respective merits. They will be con
spicuous figures while the various exhibi
tions o are in progress. They will have
autocratic power to dash the hopes of
riders of jumping horse?, who will be the
most fiery competitors of all.
"It has become a custom to bold the San
Francisco horse show later than the New
'York show. This enables the more enthu
siastic of the devotees to visit New York
/i d cast a critical glance at what is there
I red for the admiration and emulation
f the experts. Every year since San
â¦.Francisco has enjoyed a horse show of its
own, ladies and gentlemen, to whom the
sharp, staccato crack of a whip in crisp
air, on'a good road, is the best of music,
have journeyed to New York. Then they
have returned and devsted their best ener
gies to the exaltation of the California
horse and its appointments.
This year has been no exception to the
rule. What the New c Yorkers say about
their s"how may be easily summed up, and
â¢ it is interesting and somewhat amusing.
"Each horse show," says an eminent
writer of Gotham," '"is in some particular
like others, but,. also, it is vastly different
fro no all the rest. Thiais not only so with
.regard to the horses. But more so, perhaps,
with regard to the spectators."
'. . The truth is that the spectators have
â¢ become more attractive than any other
; paftof the 'show. It' has been noticed
. thatV'tbe high dames of fashion, the bail- ;
\r.eom belles and the shy btfds in their |
â¢' first season* change a? much as the horses I
do*," to quote irom the same New York
authority. The. lrorse^ that have been I
".exhibited during the os-eason just, ciosed
. have been more numerous than heretofore,
Â° and "decidedly superior in quality.
'â¢ Waiter Hobart saw the New York horse }
, show and observed keenly its various
' peculiarities. While San Franciscans are
"â¢ completing their final preparations to
make the coming show in this City a
dazzling success Mr. Hobart's remarks
come in opportunely.
'mere was some protest/ said Mr. Ho
bart, "'at New York because dealers won
;so Â°many prizes. Dealers entered tne
; gen tie men class, and as they had perhaps
twenty horses to one owned by the ordi
nary horse-owner they had a large advant
' Â°ape. Still," Â»aid Mr. Hobart, with the
. true SDirit of the sportsman, "I think that
any one "who has the best horses is en
i titled to the prizes.
Ik '"Thk entries at NÂ»ew York were large.
There were"from fifteen to forty entries in
aboust all the classes. There were from
â¢ forty to fifty entries in all the jumping
classes. Last year a mare called Spoons
o won a first-class rib boh. This year there
-were tw r enty better animals than Spoons
oin the- same'; cla^s. With few exceptions
last year's winners were not winners this
year. Â° o â¢ '.. *
y'Ttwas true that many in the crowds
of spectators went more to watch each
o :otber than to look at the horses. Yes, sir,
when the hfg est jumping was going on
the crowd on the promenade looked at the
â 'boxes, and not at the horses. A great
Â° many seemed to be there to see what
odthers wore. The people would look at
Jhe occupants'of one box and then move
. on to -another box, and seemed to regard
them as' curiosities.
"One interesting clas3 at New York in
. Qiuded a hackney stallion with four of itaf
geÂ£ andA trotting stallion with four of its
The get were considered as carriage
â¢ horses, and the trotting stallion beat the
Jwckueys.
â Was one very jcurious incident.
Asmara was entered in (he hackney class
. for two-year-old fillies, and it was not a
.hackney. Nevertheless it won the first
prize, and defeated all the other fillies of
its class, one of wnich had previously won
everything when .exhibited in England
and- in the United States. Other ex
hibitors protested, and 1 the protest held,
atid^the-blue ribbon was taken away. But
it *had beaten full- blooded hackneys for
high-Bteppinj* ana conformation.
â¢/"The jumping classes were very poor,
and o not up to my expectations. In one
class of jumpers no prizes were awarded.
F IhÂ°e"y were not up to the New. York stan
'â¢ card- of o jumpers. I think that the im
provement in the quality of horses exhib
ited at New York, year by year, is due to
\t he. weeding process that the managers)
adopted. , If forty" horses enter the I
rinc inÂ° o any one' class' the owners of all
excepting eight or -so hear the word
â  'Ga.te.'
-â¢â  "Thafc means fhat fhe horses are to go
â¢6utof the gate. There are, perhaps, only
'iour prizes, but thr owners of Mie eight
hor.<esÂ° that wenÂ» permitted to remain
have the satisfaction of not 'getting the
gate.' One man would Tiave been a prjze
winner if his groom had not been drink
ing too much.
"No horse was allowed to win in two
classes. Excepting in championships, one
horse was entitled to receive only one
prize. All the jumps were soit. An odd
fact was that last year Terrebonne was a
prize-winner and this year she got the
gate.
"The judging at New \'ork is absolutely
fair, and there were few protests. As a
rule, if a man finds that he is beaten he is
game enough usually not to say anything.
i can say, concerning our San Francisco
show, that we are right up to date. This
is the third California show. The first
show our horses were not equal to those
shown the second year, and those exhib
ited the second year will not be up to what
will be exhibited this year. The horses
that get blue ribbons here this year would
stand a good chance in New York.
"That applies to all the classes which
will be exhibited here this year. The
thoroughbreds exhibited at New York are
not nearly rp to California. We have at
least six thorough oreds here that could
easily have won first prizes in New York.
The New Yorkers were not in it in the
matter of thoroughbreds.
"Of course there were more rigs in New
York than we shall be able to show, be
cause there are so many more people there
to exhibit, but the select riga of the New
Yorkers are no better than the select rigs
we have here. The exhibition of ponies
there is no better than the one that
will be made here. The riders in Now
York were very goodâ a gocd lot. The
class of workhorses was quite a feature."
There is no doubt that Mr. Hobart will
be considered a thoroughly competent au-
I thority and that his estimate of .the com
| paratire merits of the classes exhiDited at
| New York and California will be interest-
I in<: to many. His work has indicated the
enthusiasm which has actuated him.
The entries for the coming show in this
! City have not beeu completed. The show
will hold from Wednesday to Saturday
December 9, 10, 11 and 12 inclusive, and it
| is announced that the premiums will aÂ»
--â  gregate $15,000. The following summary
I of entries will be found to be approxi
; mateiy correct, although there may be a
: few additional entries in some classes:
Thoroughbreds, 16; trotters, breeding
classes, 22; trotters, driving classes, 14;
! roadsters, 37; pacers, 6; horses in harness,
â¢125; horses and ueiivery wagons, 24;
! tandems, 14; unicorn, 4; four-in-hands,
11; ponies in harness, 16; saddie-horse?,
30; ponies under saddle, 15; polo ponies,
8; jumping classes, 31. There are some
important classes in which the entries are
not here given for the reason tbat they
are not filled, but probably will be.
The jumping classes are perhaps the
most spectacular. For these premiums j
are offered to jumpers, up to carrying 160
pounds; the jumping class open to all;

Come drift with me about the bay
Where changing lights with shadows play
And ships at anchor safely rest
Upon the bay's untroubled breast;
Where here or there a man-of-war,
Unmarked by raging battle's scar,
W ith polished guns from sijrht concealed,
Suggests a strength but half revealed.
Goat Island rises from the deep
Like some leviathan asleep,
And ceaselessly waves br-'ak In spray
On her sleek sides and slip away.
Against the amber-tinted sky
Mount Tamalpais rises high
Where sparkling waters laughing dance
Down devious ways to quiet haunts.
And nearer, where the mad tide runs,
L'es Alcatraz, with silent t;uns
Forever guarding on her breast
The Golden Gateway of the West.

Sweet with the scents from wind-swept seas,
Greeting the world with outstretched hands,

She smiles on far Sierra's snow,
Upon the ocean's ebb and flow,
While here the olive, there the vine,

How much hath Nature to thee lent,
O glorious Queen of Occident !
Whose sounding seas their praise intone
In tireless homage to thy thr6nc.

George A. Pope continues. The fashion
ables will scan their entries and the per
formances of their horses with very
marked attention. "But," said a wag
who is a friend of both, talking of their
rivalry, "they are good friends excepting
when their horses and rigs are in com

and Surprise, each being sixteen hands
high, bay mare ana gelding, with white
heel*, respectively. They will oe shown
in the brougham and other classes. Ar
lington and Arsenal won the first prize as
carriage horses at Long Branch last sum
mer. Last year Sweetheart was shown
with Senator. Sweetheart won the first
prize at Long Branch last year in the pars
class and also in the high-stepper single.
Gypsy Queen has never been shown yet
as a saddle horse. She is a promising
mare, six years old, and is entered iv the
ladies' saddle class.
Romulus and Remus, which won in San
Francisco iast year, will be entered again
this year. This information is given by
Aleck Dillon, manager fur Mr. Pope.
The horses which Mr. Hobart will show
have been previously mentioned in The
Call, but a recapitulation is appropriate
in this connection.
Mr. Hobart brought from the East
eighteen selected ponies, hackneys, coach
horse 3 and hunters. One of the new
horse 3 from the East is Paragon, a $7500
brown horse 6.years oid, over fifteen hands
and two inches high. Merry Boy is
another, a Canadian bay gelding, 5 years
old, fitteen hands and three inches high,
renowned as a hunter. Tadpole, which
can take the hurdles la fine shape, is one
of the Hobart entries. Other horses, new
to the San Francisco show, are Sultan and
Czar, Frills and Spot ana Lightfoot.
Henry J. Crocker, the president of the
Horse Show Association of the Pacific
Coast, expressed himself as vary much
pleased with the outlook for' an exhibition
this year that will compare favorably with
the New York show in many reapects.
Mr. Crocker is to the association largely
like what Napoleon was during the French
army's famous march over the Alps. He
J keeps everything in motion whiie the au
nual campaign is making.
The statement that there are- eleven en
tries in the four-in-hand classes will ex
cite the interest of the gentleman drivers.
A. B. Spreckels has offered a prize of $200
in plate for the best performance of an
amateur '<a driving a four-in-hand through
obstacles, which corresponds with c the
prize offered by John Bradbury of $200 in
plate for the best performance of an ama
teur driving a tan lem through obstacles.
I The large first prizes for which competi
j tion will be sharp are as follows:
The Huntington challenge cup, solid silver,
offered by C. P. Huntington for the best
I thoroughbred stallion, three years old or
j over, the terras of competition being that the
cup must be woo three years, in. succession by
the same exhibitor before becoming his prop
erty, and in the meantime to be held iv trust
by the association.
Silver cup, offered by the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club, In addition to the $60 prize of
fered by the association, for the best thorough
bred colt, two years old, the value of the cup
being $250.
The Morrow challenge cup, value $300, for
the best iour-iu-hand Pacific Coast bred horses,
to be shown before a coach, body break or
wagonette, the cup to be won two years in suc
cession by the same exhibitor before becom
ing his property.
There are many prizes of $200 and less,
.and among those who offer theso prizes
are Henry J. Crocker, George A. Pope,
Joseph D. Grant, Walter S. Hobart and
the California Jockey Club, all of whom,
offer valuable and leading prizes.
Of course, it. must naturally follow that,
if the standard set this year in San Fran
cisco shall be materially higher, as
claimed, than it was last year, the horse
show next year must be even finer than
the orre of ISiW, and so pti progressively.
A well-known writer, John Gilmer
Speed, reviewing the New York show of
1896, agrees, in Leslie's Weekly, "very weil
on several puints with the observation!
made by Walter Hobart concerning the
same. "The improvement for several
years past," says Mr. Speed, "has been
more marked, perhaps, among the classed
in the breeding of wnich we have not been
particularly distinguished.
"We have been trying for a long time to
breed a runner who would not only ho.'d
his own but surpass his cousins in Eng
land. In this direction we have had some
success, and the trophies of the Derby
and the Gfand Prix have come to us.
But we have, as breeders, worked even to~
rnqre purpose in our efforts to produce a
trotter that would clip the few remaining
seconds from two minutes to the mile.
The trotter has become America's greateat
achievement in horsebreeditig."
Mr. Speed also has the following to say
of interest to gentlemen drivers: "It may
be that not greater skill is required in.
taking a horse cross country than in tool
ing a coach with that dash and observance
of good form characteristic of the best
whips who wheel about the tanbark oi
Madison square with a complete control
of their animals and an amiable content
with themselves. There is one advantage
that the coachman has over the hunter,
and this is made conspicuous each
autumn when we gather in Madison
square to see the horses. The hunter, if
he have the misfortune to get stout, may
soon have to give over hU hunting en
tirely, for few horses can shoulder more
than 200 pounds and get very far from the
level ground. But a coach can hold all
the fat you can put upon it, and a man
can drive un worried by avoirdupois so
long as he can lift himself to the box.
Considering thrt nine out of ten of us
begin widening in the girth so soon, as 'we
come to 40 year,' this advantage of driving
over riding is not to be underrated."

THE WONDERFUL
NEW STEAMER ON WHEELS
1?Â»VY; squandering a few shillings yotÂ»
" J^'is an Z hl fairly satisfy yourself
LJiJ.) s whet M. Ernest Bazin, the"
: .French engineer, who has just constructed
\a packet on rollers, is a dreamer or, a ge
â¢:nius. Two things are necessary for the
' experiment, says James- W. Smith in the
.. Strand Magazineâ a sizable tank of water
, arid a large tin button, or wheel, hollow
inside and sharp at the edge. The latter
might cost two or three shillings to make.
. The water can be found in the family bath.
Â° -. " Now for, the experiment. First put
your wheel in the tank. * -It will float in
, an upright position, with about one-third
. of its bulk in the water. Now give it a
.. sudden twirl with the fingers, and be care
.â¢ ful not to push it forward. You will find
that the wheel will continue to revolve
for some time and will remain in the same
' spot in the water. Now give the wheel a
forward movement, but do not twirl it,
; and you will notice that, like the keel of
"â¢ an 3 ordinary toy boat, it will toss the
..water in- front and leave a wake behind.
It will show no tendency to revolve, and
will stop suddenly alter it has advanced a
short distance through the water. The
, j .next. c sta^e of the experiment will give
'. you a shock of delighted surprise. By
Â° .skillful manipulation, give to the wheel at
c one and the same time a twirl and a push
forward. The wheel will dash across the
, tank in the twinkling of an eve, and the
'â'â¢ water will remain almost unruffled. ,
Some, time ago in a magnificent work
shop irk LevalloiÃ-Perret, a northern su
â  â¢ burb of Paris, those simple experiments
were performed by M. Erne3t Bazin before
. a crowd of French engineering experts, and
among them were numbered some of the
most eminent admirals of the French
â â¢'" navy. Naturally there were scoffers in the
\ lot, but it is said that these remained to
â¢ prayâ for the successful application to
ocean navigation of a great principle in
. volved in the simple manipulation of a
â ' . hollow wheel upon water. The lesson
* which : tiie experts drew from the ex
â  periments was. the same lesson
that M. Bazin had drawn years
"â¢; before when, after a long series of
. -naval , inventions, his attention had
been turned to the problem of increased
.â¢ speed at" the least cost upon the ocean.
â¢His experiments told him that for the
propulsion of a boat on ; rollers he could
'.not depend dimply on the revolution of
â¢.â¢ 'the wheel?, but would have to unite the
: revolving movement with a movement
;'.' forward. The" act that the water re-'
â 'â¢ mained undisturbed when he united the
â¢â¢â¢â .movements showed that with a sharp-'
:. : edced roller the friction ordinarily met
' - with in a Keel was reduced almost to a
5 -minimum, and that as friction is one of
V; Ihe great hindrances to' speed upon the
' : ocean there was a probability that a
;â¢ steamship constructed on wheels, and in
accordance with the principles shown in
the experiments, would revolutionize
ocean navigation.
M. Bazin lately told me in Paris that if
he had had enough money he ffo'nld have
constructed his ocean steamship out
right. The enormous cost, however, of
such an undertaking compelled him to be
content with a model, and with the pre
liminary construction of a small roller
boat for the Channel service. The model
TEN YEARS AFTER.
I^T was Year's. day, when s little'
f& boy of some 10 years of age, accom-
Vi> panied by au old servant-man, was
walking from Pienhoec to Dolmen, near
Dinan. /The child was laughing and talk
ing aUthe way, and he walked at such a
rate that the poor old servitor could
scarcely keep up with him.
It was the young Viscount Herve de
Pienhoec, and' he was on hi 3 way to the
chateau, of the Marquise dv Dolmen to
W4sh her a Happy New Year. He was a
handsome lad, uprigju and straight as a
dart, and his large, darkj eyes had an
honest look in them tiat won all hearts.
Presently they came within si^rbt of tjie
old manor-house, with its . tower and
turrets, and the little Viscount bounded
<m in Jfis hurry to arrive. Very uncere
moniously he. rushed through the hall
into the Jons, tapestry-hung drawing
room, which, with its huge, old-fashioned
was accordingly made, and is a beautiful
piece of work. It rests in a large tank at
Levallois, and in. itself it is a complete
answer to the oftewi - made com
ment that a roller-boat must be an
ugly and rickety contrivance. * From the
side of the tauk, where one gets a com
plete view of the wheels, one is immedi
ately struck with the oddity of its appear
ance, but a glance along the deck from
the end of the boat shows little that is
different from the deck of an Atlantic
"liner." The front view, with the deck
extending over the open water, reminds
one of a New York ferry-boat, and the
rollers are very similar to the paddle
wneel boxes of a penny steamer on the
Thames. The staterooms, bridge and
funnels enforce this similarity. The
model i< one-twenty-fifth the size of t c
projected "liner," which will be over 390
feet long. It shows eight wheeh, four on
each side, and, like the disk with which
M. Bazin made his original experimenis,,
they are convex in form with smooth sur
faces.
Such a form can offer but littie resist
ance to the wind, while under the decks,
which arc to be constructed with powerful
uirders, the head winds will have an open
passage. The formation of the decks in
the morTel shows an enormous carrying
capacity. This is naturally a desidera
tum, for in the fast ocean steamships of
to-day very little freight is carried, on ac
count of the space occtiDied by the fuel
necessary for great speed. When ihe
"liner" is built, M. Bazin hopes to show j
that he can attain a greater Â«peed than is i
now attained, with a less expenditure cf j
fuel, and that, in consequence, a great '
deal of the space occupied by coal will be
given over to merchandise.
To the experts gathered round the tank
at Levallois the experiment^ with the sin- '
eie wheel were interestinc, but the actual
working of the model gave rise to the
highest hopes in the French breast. The
motive power was obtained from dynamos. |
One of these dynamos turned the screw or ,
propeller and gave the boat its forward j
motion, while four other dynamos â one to i
furniture and high ceiling, looted like a
corper of some cathedral. A stately loot
ing old lady was seated, and, indeed, was
almost buried In an immense armchair,
while in the wide fireplace a cheeriul Jog
tire was crackling.
"Why, .Herve. you must have risen early
this morning to pet here at this time," ex
claimed the Marquis*, looking admiringly
afr the handsome boy who had rushed in
like a whirlwind.
"Oh, grannie, and .1 had learned such a
piece of poetry to say to you, butâ l am
afraid I have forgotten every word of it, I
was in sue!) a hurry to get here," said
Herve, ruefully.
"Nevep mind, we'll have it another
time," said the indulgent oid lady. "'You
shall see first how you like your presents. '
On a tabie near were the said presents,
some story-books, some cames and a cun,"
a real gun I Herve was nearly beside hini-

each pair of wheelsâ su pplied the power
to turn the wheels. When the power was
turned on the screw began to move with
rapidity and the wheels moved slowly,
but in a moment or two the boat began to
move through the tank at surprising speed.
Then in order to exhibit the conduct of
the model in rough weather the water was
stirred up until the waves reached the
level of the deck. Yet the boat rode ,
steadily, and showed that passengers
would get little motion in a stormy sea.
It may be said in passing that when the
"liner" is constructed it will be without a
rudder, and that the steering power will
be given by a column of water ejected
from the stern by means of a pump. By
this means the vessel, instead of being re
tarded by the resistance of an ordinary
rudder, will be advantageously" assisted by
the water thrown out at the stera.
So much for the pretty model at Leval
lois. Not only on account of the cost, but
owing to the fact that Paris is on a very
narrow and shallow river, it was mani
festly impossible for the inventor to con
struct at the French capita! a trans
Atlantic steamer. It was therefore decided
to build the smaller boat with cix wheels,
just large enough to go through the locks
of the Seine, and at Rouen, where the
river is wide and deep and shipyards plen
tiful, to put in engines and heavy ma
chinery and prepare the boat finally for
its maiden trip from Havre to London. It
took some time at first to find an estab
lishment in Paris where such a unique
boat could be constructed with dispatch
and with & willing co-operation between
inventor and maker, but in the old eetac
lisnment of Cail, on the banks of the
Seine, aÂ£ Euint-D-nis, a boat five miles
from Paris, the right place was lound and
work was begun.
While the myrmidons of the CairWorks

are bringing the Parisians from far and
wide to guze at the shod ;md its cunil r< us
contents, let u< turn for a moment to the
inventor Bazin, and see what manner of
man be is. When I nr>t met him in his
hj>me in the Rue Guillaume Tell in Paris
I was surprised to find him not a man of
30 or 35â an ace which, for some reason
or other, we oft.-n attribute to in
ventors witn great untried ideasâ
but a man of 60 or thereabouts, with iron
gray hair. 'But- K. Bazin does not show
his age; h.e talks with great rapidity and
moves a3 actively as a man of 20. In face

tuft of grayish beard on his chin and a

se.f wuu joy. For two long years he had
wished fora g,un, but his parents had al
ways been afraid of an accident and had
refused to get him one. His large eyes
lighted, up witli pride and delight as he
bandied his precious treasure; and oh
how he wished there were some enemy
now before him that he could try his aim
at once.
Herve belonged to a family in which all
the men had been soldiers, and most of
his ancestors bad met their death on ihe
battle-field. His grundfither had been
killed in the Crimean War, during the
sieye of Kebustopol ; and Herve had mways
delighted in hearing tales of war.
On his way home again that afternoon
Herve kept admiring hi.s precious gun.
The old servjtor was carrying all the other
present-;, but the boy could not trust his
treasure to any other bands, and he kept
pulling the tri-ger and delighting in the
click it made as he loosed it.
They had gone along some distance
when Herve became aware that a little
boy was following them, and as he kept
quite near all the time the little Viscount
turned round at last and looked at him.
He was a boy of about his own age, but
very poorly clad; and the thin, sunken
cheeks and the pale face told of hunger
and suffering, while the dark eyes looked
so wistfully at him that Herve said kindly :
"What is it you want, little boy?"
"Not'iing; I was only looking at the
gun," replied the little lad abashed.
"What's your name?" asked Herve.
"Tanneguv." replied the other child.
"I live near to your house, and I often
watch you riding on your pony." And
then, emboldened by Herve's kindly man
ner, the poor little iellow ventured to put
one finger on the shining trigger of the
marvelous treasure.
'It's one of my presents," said Herve;
"isn't it a fine one? Have you had any
uresents?" he asked.
world, and magazines in all languages
retarding the "bateau rouleur," were
pictures and mementos connected with
the incidents of a long career in science.
One of the pictures represents the Em
peror Napoleon 111 and the Empress vis
iting the works of the inventor in 1866.
Another represents MacMabon at the
Maritime Exposition of 1875 studying a
curiously constructed boat exhibited "by
M. Bazin; and still another shows the
King and Queen of the Belgians at the
Brussels Exposition of 1876 interrogating
the inventor about his different works.
In a far-off corner of one of the walls hung
a long metal chain which hed been
dredged out of the Neva by one of M.
Basin's dredgers, and above it
was a photograph of the late Czar
of Russia, who had sent the photograph
with the chain and bis compliments.
When I a>ked the inventor for permission
to reproduce some of his mementos, he re
fused. "They are of no interest," he said,
"and mean little except to me." Then,
with ereat modesty, he added, "They are
souvenirs of the past."
It would be impossible to catalogue all
the notable inventions of this interesting
"past.'* They nre the direct result of a
Jove for things maritime nurtured by a
youthful study of science and a long serv
ice on the Indian Ocean. They include
an apparatus for indicating the distance
traveled by vessels, an hydraulic rudder,
a submarine electric light, a dredging ma
chine, a long-distance projectile and a hy
drostatic coffee-pot.
The last two inventions on the list show
that M. Bazin has not confined himself
exclusively to inventions of a naval
nature, but has touched upon all things.
An ingenious ra ichine for spinning hemp
brought him year^ ago the Cross of the
Legion of Honor, and the roller-steamship
will probably put him among the Stephen
sons and Watts who have given spur to
the progress of the world. It is the long
record of success that has lent weight to
the project of a roller-boat, and has drawn
the experts to LevalJoi* to see.
Let us now co back to the banks of the
Feme to witness the launching of the Ern
es Bazinâ the name already given to this
Queer structure, which looks more like a
gieautic plaything, or a Brobdingnagian
trolley, than a plain, everyday steamboat.
The inventor said if was like the bottom of
a tramcar with a shed over it, and possibly
this is the better simile. But photographs
throw light on places which words weakly
describe, and the accompanying illustra-
tions will tell in a second just how
the "io!ler-boat" looked "before and
after" it feit the thrill of life aiong
its six keeN. For it is evident that each
roller is a keel in itself. But tbe photo
graphs give little idea of the immense
crowd, thaf lined the banks of 6aint- Denis
on August 19â what a French writer has
called "a red-letter day in the history of
France."
There were fully 20.000 people present at
the launching, and aniung those were ad
mirals aiul naval ofncerj, and newspaper
men in all languages. The boat slid off
the ways as easily as if it had had a year's
practice, and, after a slight slum in the
Water, settled gracefully and successfully
on the piacid bosom of the Seine. Cries
of "Vive le Bazin!" mingled with cries of
"Vive la France!" and the few who ex
pected to see-the boat sink or topple over
The poor little fellow laughed bitterly.
"Ti.ere's nobody to give me a../;hin r> -.
My parents are dead."
Hecve looked at all the parcels the old
servant-man was carrying, and tie said,
eagerly:
"Choose one of my presents, little bey."
T. c lad glanced at all li.c narctvs indif
ferently, and then his eyes went bick to
the one treasure, the coveted gun, and he
snook his head.
"No; books and gnmes wouldn't be
much use to me. Can I look at the gun ?
Can I holil it a minute?"
Herve handed it to him, and they all
three walked along a littie wav together,
Taniifguy pressing the trigger uivl listen-
i OR With delight to the ciick, as Herve
had done. The little Visconnt looked very
thougntful, and then he said:
"And you haven't got a mother nor
any onÂ°, and you haven't had one
present?"
"No," replied the other, sorrowfully,
his eyes still fixed on the weapon he was
holding so carefully.
Herve was silent again for a minute.
H* was having an inward struggle with
himself; at last he said, impetuously, as
though afraid of allowing himself lo
hesitate:
"Little boy, you can keep my gun, be
cause you have not got a mother, or
any one."
Tannesuy gazed at him speechless with
as'.onishment and joy. His pale cheeks
flushed and tbe tears came into his eyes,
but he could not rind any words with
which to thank the little Viscount
Time passed by and Herve went away
to college, but in the holidays he always
saw TanneÂ»uy, who was employed on a
farm on the Pienhoec estate.
"I have always kept the gun," said
Tanneguy, one day, to the youug Viscount.
"It was the cne nappiness of my child
hood, and I shall never part with it. If
ever the day should come when you should
have need of one, you can count on me" â
and the young Breton's voice vibrated with
earnestness, so that Herve knew that these
were no vain words.
At the age of 18 the young Viscount
eniered the military school of Saint Cyr,
determined as he was to embrace thecareer
of his ancestors. Two years later the ter
rible war of '7o broke out, and Herve, with
some of his comrades of Saint Cyr, was
ar>pointed officer in a regiment.
No sooner did Tanneguy hear of this
than he hastened to engage himself in the
same regiment, and this poor young
peasant, ignorant and uneducated as ho
was, proved himself a veritable hero.
Their regiment belonged to the Army of
the North, commanded by Faiiiherbe, and
after every combat the two friend-i Bought
each other anxiously.
In spite of his heroic efforts Faidherbe
reconsidered their areuments, and con
cluded that, after all. there might be some
thing in tbose sharp and hollow wheel>.
The launching was the first real evi
dence that the boat was not a dream, and
although one man said, "Wait until the
trial trip!" the majority of spectators
were fairly convinced that the outlook for
ultimate success on the Channel was
bright.
For some weeks after the launching the
roller-boat lay in iront ol the Cail Works in
St. Denis. During this time the flooring was
laid across the iron deck-frame, the lighter
macinery was put in place and the inferior
of the rollers, which through the little
opening* at tbe top look very like the
interior framework of two big umbrellas,
was firmly strengthened. About the mid
die of September the boat was towed to
Rouen, where it was quickly changed in
appearance from a mere platform on
wheels into a most imposing craft
For the benefit of those who understand
things when they are expressed in cold
numbers a few facts may not be out of
place. The platform is about 126 feetlong
and about 40 feet wide. Each wheel has a
diameter of slightly over '61 feet and its
greatest width is 30 fer. The wheels are
covered with plate about a quarter of an
inch thick. The boat weighs 280 ton?.
The screw is moved by a machine of 550
horsepower, and each pair of wheels, as in
the Levallois model, is rotated by an en
gine oi fifty horsepower, making, for the
three pairs, a force of % 150. As may be
seen from the end view, reproduced from
the original drawing by M. Bazin. and let
to me by ihe Revue Encyclopedique of
Paris, the rollers turn upon their own axes.
The position of the screw is also shown,
arid the cross-section on the same page
bhows the position of the i udder, the ar
rangement of the machinery, the cabins,
engine-room and ventilators. The com
pactness of the total arrangement is
striking, and nothing that experience has
proved needful has been omitted in the
construction.
When the news was first spread abroad
thnt a boat on wheels had-been success
fully launched, there was great doubt as to
what "wheels" meant. Some said that
they were little, and others said they were
bis. Some sciu that -they were totally
submerged; others that they rested en
the water and skimmed along it; and
still others imagined that. the wheels were
ordinary paddles.
Any doubt as to their exact nature has,
we may venture to say, already been
cleared up by the photographs in this
article. But the doubts' regarding the
feasibility of the invention are still many.
Wouldn't the boat sink if struck?
Wouldn't it toss wretchedly on the
bosom of the deep? "Wouldn't it this,
and wou>dn't it that? Well,
a few trips on the Channel will
be the best answer to those questions.
But we may here recall the experi
ments made in the tank at Leval
lois. At that time, .as we have
said, M. Bazin, by stirring the water in
was not able to prevent the advance of
the enemy. Ou the 231 of December, 1870,
at the battle of Pont-Noyelle3, Tanneguy
distinguished himself by his bravery, and
was promuted on the battle-field, and
Herve at the same time was appointed
captain. On New Year* day, 1871, they

were in camn near Arras, and were nearly
worn out witn fatigue and privations.
"Captain," said Tanneguy, "this time
ten years ago was the day when you gave
me the little gun; do you remember?"
"Yes," said Herve, smiling, as he re
membered his own childish delight on
receiving the little weapon.
"You gave me the only pleasure I ever
had in my life," said Tauneguy.
Three days later the battle of Bapaume
toak place, and when it was growing dusk
aud the combat nearly over Tanneguy
the tank, showed that the model would
ride lightly on a turbulent sea. He also
showed that the boat was practically un
sinkable. , He pnlled out plugs in two of
the wheels and the water rushed in imme
diately. When the water.'moreover, had
risen to a certain height in the roller, the
wheel turned round and brought the hole
where the plug had been to the top. In case
of an accident to one of the rollers it
would therefore be plainly possible to
repair damages in a very convenient
fashion. In order to make plain the more
abstruse argument that there is little fric

tion or resistance in a revolving wheel, M.
Bazm placed two wooden sticks on the
surface of the tank and without turning
the wheel gave it a forward movement
against the obstruction.
The bit of wood was forced back for a
moment, but on account of the new fric
tion the wheel quickly stopped. The in
ventor revolved the wheel and sent it
against the wood. The wheel passed over
the obstruction, which sank in the water,
passed under the wheel and immediately
returned to the surface, in almost the
identical place. So far, indeed, as could
be proved by the action of the model,
every objection to the roller-boat was con
sidered as satisfactorily answered.
It is, however, in the matter of speed
that the boat may do wonders. Here,
again, the arguments cf M. Bazin, based'
upon practical experience and put forth
with a pleasant modesty, seem flawless.
The inventor does not claim for the boat a
medium speed of over eighteen knots, or
more than twenty knots when the engines
are pushed, T ose who have studied the
construction of the rollers an 1 who
know a little navigation arithmetic say
that the boat will be capable of thirty
two knots. By means of several experi
ments with the model the inventor ob
tained results which seem to show that
the enthusiasts are correct in their be
lief.
A cord attached to a framework on six
wheels was passed over a pulley, carrying
a weight of 200 grammes. The boat was
then put in positional the end of the
tank, and was drawn forward 'by the
gradual fall of the weight at the end of
the cord. The passage across the tank
occupied twenty-three seconds. Then, in
addition to the propulsive movement
given by the weight, the wheels were put
into rotation by clockwork, and the boat
went across the tank in eleven seconds. It
has since been estimated â and for the
moment a technical sentence is neces
sary â that when the correct corelation be
tween the propelling and rotary forces is
established GO per centoi' the movement in
the wheel will be forward motion. Upon
this basis, Admiral Couluombeaud, a sci
entific authority of the highest impor
tance, who has folio wed the theories and
experiments of M. Bazin from the begin
ning, has stated that a boat with wheels
69.08" meters fh circumference, revolving
at the rate of twenty-four revolutions per
minute, would cover over thirty-two knots
an hour; and in 100 hours would cover
looVed round in search of the Captain de
Pienhoec, knowing that he was sue to be
found in the thickest of the fight. Tanne

pointed at the young captain. He was
just preparing to kill his victim, intoxi
cated as he was with the smoke and the
blood all around him. Herve had only
just risen to his feet when he saw the
Prussian's weapon pointed at him, and he
ielt sure that bis last moment had come.
Suddenly a man bounded between him
more than the distance from Havr.e to
New York. â¢
This, no far as it can be rid of techni
calities and con f using numerical calcula
tions, is the basis for the proph*ecy ths-W
we are on tlie eve of a great revolution in"m
navigation. In 1895 the fleet LucMiiia
cro-sed the Atlantic at the rate of 22 knots
an hour, and her sister ship, the Cam
pania, ha 3 made 560 knots in one day. An
average fast? eteamer rareiy goes more
than 20 knots an hour; although the tor
pedo-boat destroyer, Sokol, which is said 1
to be tne fastest steamer in the world, has
made over 30 knots. But in the case of
ocean liners such as are buift to-day
a like speed will probably never be ob
tained.
One authority has lately said .that it
costs thousands of pounds to add an extra
half-knot on a fast steamer's speed, and
that the limit has probably even now
been reached. The power wasted in over
coming the friction and resistance of the
water is enormous; and as the horse
power needful to force a ship through the
seas increases tremendously with every
knot so\ight for, it is little to be marveled
at that the "roller-boat," with its asserted
economy and quickness, has caught the
attention of ;he world.
The promises held out stir tbe mind
and move the pen with enthusiasm. The
prospect that the present voyaga between
Queenstown or Southampton and New
York may be cut down to four, and possi
bly three and a half days, makes the in
valid on the ocean "liner" raise his head
in prayerful thanks. The business man
sees that the success of the invention puts
him into communication with his cus
tomers more quickly than the merchants
of Phoenicia could have dreamed.
The steamship companies, looking at it
from a food standpoint, see that the sav
ing of a hunared hours from Havre to
New York means the saving of tons of
eatables, and, iv consequence, increased
dividends. The "globe-trotter" thrills
with the idea that the record? of Phileas
Fogg and Nellie Bly will be extinguished,
and that Puck's will be threatened. The
hopes of all are rosy, but in them there is
a basis of practicability. Why should wa:
not go faster? It is evolution. .'â¢â 
For France the result is all-important.
i While other nations have been making
steady progress in the speed of their ves-v
sels that country has lagged behind. \ ff^
There" are only two -great steamship com?^
panics flying the French flag, and the best
boats on these lines have reached their '
limit of speed in eighteen knots. Under
these condition? Frenchmen have- lost
nope in the struggle for commerce. The
appearance of M. Bazin his revived the
hope in their minds that when the roller
boat takes its place In the ocean service
the supremacy in commerce will belong
to France.

had rushed to the rescue, bounding 1 over
every obstacle, trampling under foot the

time to avert thÂ« danger.
Tanneguy stooped down and snatching
from the dead soldier his gun presented it
to Herve, who was disarmed.
"Captain, you once gave me a gun, let
me pay my debt to you with this one-"
Before he had finished speaking aod
while holding the weapon out to Herve,
poor Tanneguy stasrrered back and fell.

NEXT Thursday evening the fall ex
hibition of the &an Francisco Art
Association will open at the Mark
Hopkins Institute, and lrom present indi
cations it is to be a most characteristic
display of the work of native painters.
Few of the many canvases to be exhibited
were painted ior the purpose of being
shown to the public. They are merely the
regular studio work, and as such are de
serving of the greatest consideration.
Nearly all of the pictures were painted in
California, and the few that do bear the
name of a foreign city do not gain any
thing by being placed beside the work
dove on the Pacific Coast. In fact, it j
might be said, they lose, for some of them
are certainly far behind the work of San
Francisco painters.
In the coming exhibition there will be |
few large canvases and a great num- |
ber of very smali ones. Indeed, it would
seem, as if there are to be roore
eniall pictures than have ever before
been placed in a single exhibition.
There is no particular reason for this.
It just happens that small pictures have
been painted and will be exhibited. On
tiie whole the smaller pictures are fully as
meritorious as the larger ones.
Another thins: of great interest to those
interested in Western art is the fact that
most of the pictures are of California
scenes. To be sure, there are several
Kigbly creditable canvases of rcenes in the
most picturesque parts of Europe. And
Why should there not oe? A painter should

duces an accurate transcript from nature
it matters little, from an artistic stand
point, whether it is a picture of the Seine
or the San Joaquin. Nevertheless, it is
) gratifying to know that the grandeur of
! the Pacific Coast is motif enough for some
j painters.
In the coming exhibition the whole
State has been covered.
Thomas Hill has painted the mountains
and the great redwoods; Keith has repro
duced the mysterious depths of the oak
forests with the ever changing atmos
pheric effects; Piysis has caught the
solemn uplands along the coast; Joullin
has shown us what artistic quality there
is in the sanddunes; Yelland and Latimer
have reproduced the quiet pastoral bits of
the interior valleys. Several of the artists
have produced pictures of scenes alone
the bay. In decorative and still life work
there will be a large quantity, but of as
good quality as can be found in any city
of the United States. There will not be a
large number of portraits, but then San
Francisco painters never did do much in
that line.
A tour of the studios was made a few
days ago by a Call representative and j
most of the pictures that will be placed on
public view next Friday were "put in a j
good light" for inspection. The tour was i
a most gratifying one in every respect.
J. A. Stanton was putting tbe finishing
touches on a "Holland Sea Coast," while
all about were pictures from sunny
France. Stanton loves to paint the Nor
mandy peasants in their picturesque gar
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1896.
ment?, and certainly does it in a credit
able manner. All of his pictures are full
of light and coior and have a tender senti
ment most subtly expressed. Mr. Stanton
will exhibit five canvases in all. One of
these is a most creditable composition en
titled "The Star of Bethlehem," and on
which he received a medal while in Paris.
"Waiting for the Boats" is a characteris
tic bit of Holland coast portrayed in a
most forcible and graphic manner. "Low
Tide, Brittany," is a most interesting
study cf French fisherfolk. "A Ballet
Girl" is a pretty picture devoid of all seri
ousness, but full of good drawing and
color. In addition to these there are a
couple of very meritorious marines.
E. M. Pissis will be represented by sev
eral canvases showing scenes in both
France and California. "On the Coast"
is a splendid study of that piece of coun
try lying along the seashore south of the
Cliff HoufÂ«. The wastes of sand and the
desert vegetation are depicted admirably.
This work is exceptionally good in color.
"Autumn Woods" is a splendid study.
There are several other smaller canvases
showing bright bits of nature along the
ever picturesque Seine and in the depths
of the romantic forest of Fontainebleau.
Mr. Pissis' painting is conscientious in
the extreme, but at the same time easy in
handling and rich in color.
R. D. Yelland sends three good-sized
canvases in his best manner. AH show a
great deal of study and an effort to get at
the facts of nature. At the same time a
poetic interpretation is given them, so
that the result is most pleasing. "Twi
light" is a picture full of rich color. The
sun has already sunk beneath the horizon
and the face of nature is partly veiled in a
purple mist. On the whole a very credita
ble piece of work. "Monterey Moorlands 1 '
is a typical bit of California coast with a
bright sky and a rich foreground. ''Early
Moonrise" is a transcript from nature. It
shows a spot not far from Pacific Grove
and tbe effect is most pleasing. The soft
glow of the moon is all-pervading and pro
duces a mystery in the deeper shadows that
create a slight feeling of awe. It is a
pleasing picture and at the same time can
truly bssaid to be well paintod.
William Keith sends sereral landscapes
painted in his best style. There are no
large canvases among them, but all are
interesting and full of color and life.
"'Summer Moonlight" is one of Mr.
Keith's latest works and, it might be
added, one of his best. The composition of
sky, trees, water and foreground does not
differ materially from his usual style, but
in handling and color it is a distinct de
parture. Broad and vigorous in treatment,
it maces one leel ns if he were really look
ing at a bit of nature. The light from the
moon touching the edges of the clouds is
little short of wonderful.
Thomas Hill, who is now In San Diego,
has sent four laree canvases. The best ol
these is entitled "An April Shower.'' It
is a vigorous piece of painting, and fu'l of
color. It represents a scene in the moun
tains, and the rain is btatlng down with
great fury. Every part of the picture is
dripping wet. "Evening in the Pathless
Woods" is a strong picture, with a large
nesr, about it thai is remarkable. The
redwoods are actually gigantic, and the
forest interior seems like some vast
cathedral. Mr. Hill's other pictures are
called studies, painted in a style he used
several ypnrs ago.
Oscar Kunath has two very creditable
figure studies. "LÂ«dy With Mandolin"
is a tine piece of paintinpr. The drawing and
color are superb and the smallestdetails
are conscientiously worked out. This
canvas is very small, and when looking at
it one feels as if it ou^ht to have been
larger, so t;ood is the work :n every part of
it. A half length nude female figure In
pastel is good in drawing itnd a good piece
of posing. The color, however, is a little
harsh. It has a peculiar rednes3 thai
prrduees an unpleasant effect.
L. P. L.ttimer sends three pictures, two
in water color and one in oil. All of them
are characteristic of Mr. Latimer and
fully up to his usual standard. "Live
Oak, Berkeley," is a good piece of paint
ing. The composition is simple, but the
color is rich and strong. "The Edge of
the Meadow'" is a large water color of -\ ]
characteristic bit of landscape. The other j
piotme is a small water color entitled
"Sunset."
The pictures which Amadee Joullin
will send to the fall exhibition are those j
he painted during the past summer. They
have already been described in The Call, j
so that only a brief mention is necessary j
here. In all there will be five creditable
canvases. "On the Trail" is the largest
of these, and represents an Indian sneak
ing over a sandhill. The other pictures
arc "Alameda Sand Dunes," "Stretch of
Beach," "Fish Alley, Chinatown," and
â¢â¢A Sketch."
Miss Elizabeth Strong will be repre
sented by two dog pictures of a high
order. Her work shows constant im
provement and a steady pain in strength.
"With the First Shot," is a creditable
piece of -work, showing a beautiful setter
carrying a duck in his mouth that he has
just brought from a marsh. "A Meeting"
is a splendid dog picture. The two ani
mals are posed in the most natural man
ner, and their tails seem to be actually
wagging. In color this picture is rather
on the landscape order, but it is most
agreeable in tone and scintillating with
light.
Miss Matilda Lotz has sent in an excep
tionally good cattle study. It represents
the interior of a barn, and a calf in the
foreground gives a good opportunity for
strong effect, and Miss Lotz has taken ad
vantasrc of it, for sue has handled it ad
mirably. Every part of the animal is
carefully studied. All tbe forms are accu
rately indicated and the general color
dcherae is strong and rich.
Harry Stewart Fonda is a young man
who has lately returned from Europe
after itn absence of several years. His
work, however, is not what would be ex
pected after so much study. "Reverie" is
rather an ambitious piece of work, but
that is about all that can be said of it
The fipure is not bad, and there is some
good color in parts, Dut on the whole the
picture is disappointing. "Coast of Con
carneau" is a large marine, of which little
can be eaid in the way of praise. The
forms of the waves are fair, but the color
is jarring.
C. Chapel Jul son has sent in a large
number of pictures of different grades of
merit. Some of these show study, but the
majority simply indicate an attempt to
"turn out" pictures. "Sunset on the
Marsh" is onÃ of the best of the lot. It is
fairly good in color and the drawing of the i
trees and different objects is most credit- !
able.
Miss Matilda Hampe sends several
flower pieces. A large "Study of Chry
santhemums'.' has many nood points. It
is strong in color and drawing and the
general effect 13 pleasing.
Sydney Yard of San Jose sends several
small water colors with cotfsiderabl
merit about them. Many of them are
studies fron\ nature and indicate a subtle
grasp of the subjects chosen.
Miss C. Ml BoUwell has sent in two small
pictures with a great deal of merit. One
is in water color and ttie other in oil.
The water color, "From Nature," is very

creditable, both in drawing and color and
also in the general outdoor effect.
In addition to the artists mentioned
there will be about thirty-five others rep
resented. Over 200 p ctures have been re
ceived, but as a number of these will be re
jected, not over 175 will be hung. But
this is enough and makes a good showing,
and as the merit of the pictures is or a
hien grade, the exhibition will be a credit
able one, and one that San Francisco may
well be proud of.

Woman's Whist League.
At a recent meeting and tournament oi
women whisters just held in Philadelphia the
following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the contestants in the wo
man's tournament, held at 1119 Spruce street,
Philadelphia, November 11, 12 and 13, 1896.
heartily approve oJ the formation of a Wo
man's Whist Lengue, and for the accomplish
ment of that object call upon the women whist
players of America to organize whist â¢clubs and
send representatives irom such clubs to a
meeting to be held for the purpose of league
organization. That Mrs. T. H. Andrews be re
quested to act as cnalrman of a committee of

place for such a meeting and issue a call for
the same.
9 Ail women interested are asked to commu
nicate with Mrs. T. H. Andrews, 1119 Spruce

The idea of starting a women's whist league
was suggested to our Whist Queen, Misstate

it was dropped. If the time is ripe for it now
Mrs. Andrews will never allow any thin*, to
fail that see takes ho^d^oi. *

:t My ârâ : .. A great many hands that may
lead to bri. limit end play are not good testsof judg
ment, in the opening, stage*. For instance, If a
player finds himself with a tram u too many and
has to play the grand coop it is probable be could j
have got rid of his trump to more advantage If he
bad played to be forced at the commencement of
ihe hand; ; so that : by setting such a deal for ex
periment one may be . favoring short player*.
I think the best' tests of judgment, are humdrum
hands, in which the . cards pay. respect,- to the laws
of probabilities:; but 'these hands seldom lead to
brilliant end play.- The hand I send you occurred

After the ceremony the floor was c eared and
dancing was in order until 12 o'clock, when
the guests to the number of about fifty pro
ceeded to the spneious dining-room, where
an elaborate feast was prepared. The presents
received by tha bride were very numerous and
costly.

H. S. Cahill and Miss Idonia Ogden, both of

simple gown of white silk, and with uer tulle

After the ceremony, which was performed
by the Rev. Mr. Bateman of Paso Rooles, the

to me two nights ago: it seems to lead to Interest

seems to me to he a fair test of judgment. Should
another more suitable hand occur I -will se 'd it to

rather doubtful whether SoutlFs play "would have

Trick 3â East's best lead is doubtful. He
might perhaps have done, better to lead clubs
through the strong band, assuming that
North had some reasons for discontinuing the
suit.
Trick 4â Sooth's trump lead is clearly right.
Trick sâ South's play is a matter of taste.
He was lucky in his selection.
Trick 9â North should have led another dia
i mo:id to force South. West is clearly right not
to trump.
Trick 10â By. leading trump South is almost
certain of game.
y\. W. L. Challenge Jrophvj.
The thirty-fourth challenge match for the A.
W. L. trophy was piayed on Saturday, Novem
ber 14, in Philadelphia, between the Hamil
tons, the present holder, and the Boston Dup
licate of Boston. The Hamiltons won by a
score of 26 to 16. It seems strange to us, way
out here in this wild and woolly West, that the
great Hamilton club of Philadelphia have only
four players that can defend the trophy. We
think it is for the best interest of the game not
to allow the same team to play for tne trophy
more than two or three times at the most.

This flourishing little whist club has just
started in for its third season of whist play. We
beg to acknowledge receipt of a letter from
their secretary. Mrs. Frederick N. Hall, who
tells us the ladies are all deeply interested
trying to improve their play and are students
of the game. Our whist editor extends an
invitation to the entire club to come any
Wednesday afternoon to the rooms of the
Trist Duplicate Whist Club, in the Berkshire,
on Jones street, near Sutter, to listen to whist
talks, given free to all lovers of the game.

readers next week.
President George E. Bates of the San Fran
cisco Whist Clud has brought about a change
in the game of straight whist among those
that prefer straight to duplicate. It is the
adoption of. seven points for a game instead of
the short English game of five points. By this
change better whist jivill be ployed, as every
' deal is played to the finish. The other way, when
one odd trick is required to win a game and
it is madeâ down goes the balance of the hand
and a new deal, is had. All whist students
know that short whist never leads to brilliant
end play.

BRANCH S IOKEâ i i ana 744 Market StBELVEDERE HAS
A FIGHT ON HAND
â¢ o Proposition to Incorporate
Develops Serious Op
position.
Olympic Boatmen Protest, as
o I Th^e.ir Clubhouse Would
I-'- Be Taxed.
â¢ rhÂ°e Campaign Extends to This Cily
Â° and Interests Otvners of Arks
and Eo3ts.
â¢ Â° " L " Â°o Â°Â° Â° â¢ Â° o
A fierce apposition has developed in,
Belvedere against the effort to incorporate
the picturesque seaside suburb and the
fight has changed its situation to a large
. extent, it has come to San Francisco and
here many interested parties are making
an active canvass to defeat the move
ment.
The reason for this change of base is
due to the fact that the. incorporation of
Belvedere would directly affect the owners
of 3-aclus, barges, boathousÂ»s and all kinds
rf craft now lying in Belvedere cove,
/t lich comes within the boundary line of
â ;. c town to be incorporated. Most of thÂ«
\ -rait moored in the cove belong to people
who live in Â£an Francisco and leave their
boats at Belvedere as a matter of conveni
ence. Up to the present time 'they have not
been compelled to pay taxes on their house
boats or yachts and it is the fefir of being
tnxed that makes them protest. They ate
fully alive to the fact that if Belvedere
were incorporated a new town tax would
be imposed uixÂ»n their boats. In which
event more than one ark-dweller and
yachtsman has declared his intention of
moving to some other location in the bay
where he will'be free from taxation.
Probably one of the most powerful
factors in the campaign is the Olympic
Club boating annex, which entered into
the fight a few days ajjo and began active
mark yesteid.ay. The Olympic boatmen
are' decidedly opposed to the incorpora
tion,, and will light, to the end. Their
- boathonse, was opened iaÂ«t season,
- is situated on the Belvedere side of the
drawbridge leading to Tibnron, and is
.\ â Consequently within the boundaries of the
â  c j>rbrv"aed incorporated township.
.o Â°<"There is nirich' taxable Droperty at the
Â° ' Olympic boathouse, so the clubmen would
Iwve to give up a neat little sujn annually j
to lidÂ© pay Belvedere's taxes. For in- i
â¢ stanc?. there ars twelve boars, including
\ large barges, racing shells, outriggers and
'the like, allot which taken together rep- j
â¢ r,e'ssJnt some thousands of dollars. In au
'adition to the boats there is a iarpe a:id
well-appointed clubhouse with ti:te?n
o *bedÂ°roouis furnished for members. But
â Â°Â° the Olympics do not like the idea of pay
ing new taxes,. aha with such a conviction
-iiiOsi in .their minds they naturally
v at tilings to remain undisturbed.
". One <rf them said yesterday that a com
Â°nii'tee from the boating annex would use
iheircperisausive pcrwers on Frank tUone,
.the'Voai-buiider, who is a voter of Belve
; (feje, and at the same time closely ron
â  nected.>in ,*n business way witn the!
'Olympics. They want him to use bis in
' rfluence on his friends in Belvedere, or |
â  father on the voter* in wlio^e hands lies
. the, question of incorporating.
A'nion<i the dwellers of Belvedere an op
poÂ°sitiori party has developed equally with
k ,the c canva'sf ior votes in favol> of incor-
The election will be held on!
â â¢December. 19, when five trustees will be I
. selected' to terra if the voters decide to i
have a a .township. Before "that date con- j
Biderable active campaigning will be done, i
â¢for as the days pass the contest grows hot
ter, on tlie bpat between Tiburon and ibis
L::y, in offices, in clubs and in the homes I
â¢ on the hill'ide. The leaders for Incoi- I
pqraiion numrjer among them C. O. Perry
o of' tiie^ Columbia Bank, Dr. Dunbar, the
odentist, and E. M. Wilson, the attorney
for the Befveaero Land Company.
About Iml f the people who live all the i
â¢' yea.r o Â°roiina in Belvedere are said to be op- j
posed to Incorporation. They are led by I
â¢ J.Â° D." Maxwell, 1 Charles Crocker, Peter'
' Dean, J. W. Don-ey and Dr. Byron Haines. j
One of them saii yesterday that Belve- I
here has not more than .'RKJ residents who !
â¢ live there .all year, while a population of |
at leant 500 is required by law as the first ]
reason for incorporating.
â¢ "TheÂ°othej-3 are summer boarders," said i
he". "^This is simply a plan to unload on !
us as by it we would be compelled to take
take care of the roada to Tiburon bridge,
several miles of them through ihe island;
and aieoto'pay for a town clerk, town j
constable and town attorney. Our taxes [
would be trebled. Besides, everything |
moored in Belvedere cove would be taxed,
ana on thai account there is a probability
that the arK- and yachts may lina another
mooring ground."
. TLe explanation given by thoÃe in favor
of the movement is that Tiburon. miuht
incorporate, and then under the Jaw Bel
vedere would be prevented from taking
the same action because no town can in
corporate in Calilornia within thiee miles
of an incorporated township. This is
pooh-poohed by the opposition, which
asserts that Tiburon is owned by the San
Francisco and North Pacrtic Railway, a::d
for that reason there need be no fear from
that quarter. The railway company, it is
contended, would not incorporate the
. town because that would increase expenses |
and taxation.

FROM GREATER NEW YORK
A Budget of Interesting J^JeWs and Qossip
/\bout the California Colony in the
Eastern Metropolis
NEW YORK, N. V.. Nov. 22.â "True
greatness consists in serving the salad at
the right moment." was a weli-known ex
pression of that famous epicure, the late
John CnamDerMn.
Charles Delmonico is of the same belief,
and as he lias built a fortune serviuc rich
dainties at the proper time and when most
Jippreciated by iho inner man there muct
be some truth in the epicure's
definition of "true greatness." One
thing sure is that alter the de
moralizing effects of the election, the
feverish excitement of the horse show and
the indifferent enthusiasm over comic and
burleyque operns. dramatic first nights and
jumbled -up vaudeville entertainments,
the grand opera season comes like a soot!;
--inp baini to the flushed and weary multi
tude. Sc!:oef.fel and Grau hove shown true
greatness in serv ng us witn such a well
ordered feast â afen&tof sound, of beauty
and mapniiicence â the exulted triumph of
human voices swaying the senses of a sen
of mortals.
Who care 3if Melba is growingstont and
inclines to embonpoint; i-Â» not her voice,
with ifs clear, sweet noes, still ringing
and thrilling through every liber of your
body? What if Cylve is becoming heavy
about the jowls, does not her wa/m,
sensuous presence and her dramatic voice

CAUGHT A KITTEN
IN A DRAIN PIPE
Novel Angling by McCur
rie at the Fair
mount.
FuDny Rescue Expedition Which
Decidedly Was a Howling
Success.
One Ca'ico Cat and One Other Were
Save- From a Lam ntable and
Uitimsly Ead.
Matthew MrCurrie was yesterday a hero
and a deliverer lrom Buffering of beasts
and mankind. Strong men wrung his
stout ri<:ht hand until he cried "hold,
enough." Women looked at him grate
fully. Small girls approved him heartily.
Only bad and mischievous boys looked .:t
him askance and said to eacn other, "He's
ii o t:ood."
McCurrie is an officer of the Society for
tr.e Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Yesterday the telephone belj in the socie
ty's cilice rang violently and kept it up for
quite a time.
"Hello! " answered McCurrie.
Tins-a-lmg-a-ling.
"Hello!" said McCurrie. louder, "hello,
oh, helio! "
"Come out," said a thin female voice,
"come oui and get the kittens out of the
drainpipe. There are eleven, and perhaps
more, in there."
McCurrie pulled out a long ssck, which
would bold eleven kittens, young and old,
simultaneously, and started out lo the ad
dres" which had been given. Thi3 was at
the Fairmount Hotel.
He found things in bad shape. From
a long pipe, extending from tae roof to
the ground, proceeded a series of agonized
cries.
â¢ "Meoow!"
"Miew!"
"Ah." said McCurrie, "but this is
tough."
There were several stories current to
explain how the kittens got into the drain
pipe. One wjs that they were engaged in
a iriendJy gsme of tag and one chased the
other in. Another was that they were on
the edge of the roof an"d fell In. They had
been in the pipe something likÂ« two days
when McCurrie arrived. \ atious schemes
had been tried to get them out, ranem* â 
from the idea of putting a bowl of miiic
and a beelsteak on the roof and saying,
"poor -kitty," to lowering a snare ac tue
end of a stick.
McCurrie is fertile in inexpedien'3. He
did not proceed at once to work, but sat
down and thought a little. His cogita
tions resulted in a well-matured plan,
which was worthy of a strategist and a
humanitarian all in one. He bad in view
tne structure -of a cat in his mind's eye
and knew that cats cannot be tisheu out
from depths like minnows.
The guests in the hotel looked on with
admiration while McCurrie made bis
preparations. First he got a piece of
stout cloth. This he fastened serurely to
a long cord. He fastened a weight or
sinker to the whole and lowered away
carefully. McCurrie is an expert fisher
man and knows when he has a nibble.
Pretty soon he got one.
Then like a true sportsman he began to
pull in the line, hand over band. A few
seconds later two furry ears, and next the

view. Sure enough, the top Kitten in tbe
pine had "caught on." Its sharp claws
had grasped the cloth as soon as it came "
in reach. It nung on like a leech and kit
ten No. 1 bad been rescued.
The next kitten was, unfortunately, in
the t>ipe in the reverse attitude, tail up
and head down, so that its claws could
not catch hold of the cloth. Heroic meas
ures must therefore be resorted to. The
Dlan of campaign was not less masterly in
the second instance. Vigorous bar.da
were laid on the drain pipe which was
torn down and the second kitten, which
never bad ceased to emit plaintive noises,
was dragged out to view. Two minutes
later both kittens were playing in the sun.
The guests of tlse hotel were relieved and
the epi'oiie was over.

CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE.
President Cleveland has so far pro
gressed in the work on his message to
Congress that our correspondent at Wash
ington has been abW to give a summary
of the subjects of which it will treat and
a fair outline of what the President wili
say concerning them.
It is tne intention of the President
that this, which ia to be his last an
nual message to Congress, â¦shall be
the most important of his public docu
ments. He will make it the occasion
for setting forth the policy" which he be-,
lieves ought to be follower by the National
Government for tue maintenance and ad
vancement of the prosperity of the coun
try and will design it no doubt to serve as
a plea for all the acts of his administra
tion.
Considerable attention will, of course,
be paid to foreign affairs, and the Presi
dent will congratulate the country upon
the solution of the Venezuelan contro
versy. It is also said he will devote con
siderable space to Cuba, but it is not yet
known what he will say. This fact throws
a singular light upon the character of the
President. Perhaps there is no other
statesman of responsibility in the country
who, after all that has been done in Cuba,
has not yet decided what course he ought
to pursue and is still waiting for some
thing to turn up which will help him out
of his quandary.
Although there is not much prospect
that Congress will give much heed to any
thing the President may say concerning
the revenue or the financial question it is
announced that Mr. Cleveland wil devote
much of iiia message to an elaborate con
sideration of these issues. It is in this
part of his document that he will endeavor"
to justify the policy of his admimstratio n.
In this respect, therefore, the paper
will be intended for the future historian
rather than for the politic* of to-day. It
will, of course, be waited for with a great
deal of interest, for even the opponents of
Mr. Cleveland have considerable curiosity
to know what he can say in defense of an
administration which has been so disas
i trous to every industry of the country.
From the reports given out it appears
the President will make no statement
concerning the funding bill or the Nicara
gua canal. Ihese omissions will largely
counterbalance whatever good effects may
result from anything he may say ol other
issues. It is clear that these questions,
together with that of Cuoa, will be the
most interesting to arise at the coming
session of Congress, and for the President
to omit them from his message will be
another proof how far he is from under
standing the American people and how
completely he is out ot touch with public
sentiment.
IN FRIENDLY RIVALRY.
The great football contest which was
fought out on Thanksgiving day between
the Crimson an I the Blue and Gold con
tained a feature which augurs well for the
future of the country when it shall have
passed into the hands of the youth who
are now being educated. Immediately
after the game the captain of the tenm
ihat failed wrote a message of congratula
tion to the victor that sounds true blue
and as good as gold.
'Yours : in friendly rivalry," he signed
himself, and if the minds of our young
men are being trained to hold themselves
in this attitude then, indeed, we may have
happy hopes that friendly emulation in
all branches of effort will lead them to
such heights that even the seemingly de
feated will be more than victors. Great
will be the welfare they will brin^ to the
world when they come to rule if football
should so- thoroughly train their tempers
as to enable them to show the same gener
ous spirit in all the comests of the future.
Football doubtless has its uses beyond
those dpsirable ones of developing good
lungs and tough muscles and digestive
powers that can work felicitously. Time
is not wasted, even in a spiritual sense, in
producing a miw ular manhood that can
struggle to a hard finish with the utmost
good nature. There is a sort oi magnifi
cent animalism which makes it ea-y for
the soul united thereto to be magnan
imous.
It is in the acquirement of this that col
lege athletics have their highest purpose.
Perhaps especially in- the rou.h and tum
ble of football can mental placidity and
courtesy to opponents under exasperating
circumstances be cultivated. Also the
habit of petting up promptly to fight again
after being unceremoniously knocked
down and run over is an excellent posses
sion to have, and playing football cer
tainly has a tendency to mind ac
customed to doing t is merrily.
California has reason to be proud of the
spirit manifested in ;he ma eh by both
the victors and the vanquished. It is a
good thin? to triumph without vainglory
and to bear defeat without bitterness. "In
friendly rivalry" is the motto for all C:\li
fornians. Well done, Stanford! Well
said, Berkeley !
COAST DEFENSES.
The report of Secretary of War Lamont
is interesting chiefly because of the earnest
efforts which the Secretary is evidnntly
making on behalf of the coast defenses o
the country. Thu subject is one whose
importance is now well understood, and
the SecietarJ-'s recommendations will be
cordially approved.
As Secretary Lamont says, his prede
cessors in office at the head of the War
Department,- have during many years
faced the difficult task of arousing the
public mind to a realization of the <iiih'
culties in the matter of coast defense, but
Have so far succeeded in awaken in â¢ public
interest on the subject that any further
arguments are unnecessary. Ench succes
sive Congress has shown a greater will
ingness to make appropriations for this
cause, and there can be little doubt that
the coming one will be equally wise in
providing for it.
The plan of coast defense which has
been undertaken involves over one hun
dred distinct batteries, in somothing more
than twenty harbors, and constitutes an
efficient protection for the more im
portant seap.orts both of the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts. A large amount of work
in these defenses has been already done,
and while much remains as yet incom
plete, the Secretary gives reasons for be
lieving that within a comparatively short
space of time our coasts will be made
practically secure against foreign attack.
The extension of our coast defenses
necessarily calls lor an increase in the
force to man them. This, of course, will
entail the enlargement of the army by the
addition of new battpries of artillery, and
this is the only increase in the army which
the Secretary asks for. It may be noted
that this shows a difference of opinion
batween the Secrstary of W?.r and the
commanding general, since General Miles
asked for an increase of cavairy to guard
the great West as well as an increase of
artillery to guard the coast.
It is pleasing to note that the problem
of providing our coast deferses with satis
factory disappearing gun carriages seems
to have been successfully solved. The

oer construction, and eight or ten such
carriages of similar design are about to be
constructed.
The report as a whole will be well re
ceived by the country, and the recommen
dations of the Secretary deserve favorable
consideration from Congress. The amount
of money asked for, according to the
estimates for tho next fiscal year, will
aggregate $10,482,268. This sum is not
large when the importance of the work
of the War Department is taken into, con
sideration, and it is not likely that it will
be materially reduced when Congress
makes up the appropriations for the ensu
ing year.
GREAT BRITAIN'S ISOLATION.
One of the most important speeches of
the year in England was delivered re
cently by fiir Charles Dilke at a meetine
of the Liberals and Radicals at Enfield.
In the course of hi 3 address Sir Charles
made some extraordinary revelations of
the conduct of European diplomacy and
expressed himself as decidedly in favor of
the isolation of Great Britain from any
European alliance.
The most important statements made
by Sir Charles were these: First, that
three great powers lately proposed to
England" the partition of China and that
the British Government refused its con
sent. Second, that the Russian general
who was reported to have inspected the
Dardanelles fortifications really did so
and moreover acted as the representative
of the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Third, that Russia, France and Ei
could compel Turkey to carry out desired
reforms by simply agreeing among them
selves to turn over to Greece, in case the
Sultan refused, all the islands along the
coast of Asia Minor now held by the lurk
ish Government.
The speaker went on to say he was op
posed to any policy looking to the parti
tion of the Turkish empire. Such a
policy meant great risk of general war and
moreover would entail arrangements detri
mental to British trade and costly to the
country as regards the scheme of national
defense. The partition of Turkey he
thought was as undesirable as the parti
tion of China, but ha declared that if
Russia and France would agree upon the
policy of re3ioring the islands to Greece he
would favor England's surrender of Cy
prus to Greece as a part of the general
plan.
The occupation of Egypt he dec'ared to
be one of tho most considerable diffi
culties in the way of arranging such a
treaty with France and Russia. He,
moreover, regarded the occupation of
that country as a military weakness to
England and of no value whutever to the
empire. He declared himself, therefore, in
favor of abandoning Egypt as well as
Cyprus, thereby putting England in a
position where she could act with greater
force in the settlement of tho Turkish
problem.
Sir Ciiarles closed his speech by declar
ing, however, that he did not seek nor
favor an alliance with France or Russia,
or any other nation further than was
necessary for the single object of set
tlin;: the existing problem. A limited
ailiance confined to the tarrying out of a
certain definite purpose was as far as he
was willing to go. He declared outright
for a policy of isolation which would leave
England free in all cases and at all times
to control iier own policy of action.
The speech is the more notable because,
with the possible exception of Lord Salis
bury, Sir Charles Dilke is regarded as ihe
ablest master of foreign affairs in British
politics. While his personal influence
was largely lost by the scandals in which
he was involved some years ago, his
knowledge of loreign politic-sand his pene
trating insight into the conditions of
modern Europe were in no wise :iffected
by the circumstances which have excluded
him from further participation in any
Cabinet.
The British people, therefore, still listen
to him with interest and are lurgely
guided by his counsel. He stands now
midway between the position taken by
Salisbury and that of Mr. Gladstone, and
in the prevalent confusion ol British
ideas as to what should be done in regard
to Turkey, it can hardly be doubted that
his speech will have great weight in de
termining the course to be pursued.
EUROPEAN PEACE.
The German Kaiser in a speech con
taining complimentary allusions to the
Czar said the autocrat is lord of an
immense army only for the purpose of
maintaining peace, and there can be no
doubt tde German Enjperor in thus call
inn attention to the benencent use of
power by his great neighbor meant to
show himself to Uifl world in that
light. Moreover, Punch contains an illus
tration of the Russian Emperor kissing
the hand of the Em} ress of India as he
bids iaroweil at the cattle of Balmoral, in
which she is represented ;-s saying to her
kin-man that all is well so long as they
two remain in power.
There can be little doubt that these
great potentates have good intentions
about preserving the peace of Europe, and
in one way of looking at the que?tion it is
a source of satisfaction that sucti immense
equipments for destruction should be held
iv readiness for the enforcement of peace.
It would seem, however, that while
these peacefully dispo-eJ people are in
positions of such great influence on the
world a ae3tiny, they might use that in
fluence in putting the peace of Europe on
a more permanent basis tnan the mere
dread of each other's power. If they sin
cerely desire that ail war should cea?e
the Burest way to secure such a re>ult
would be to enter into a mutual agree
ment to have their war teeth pulled.
Itcobts $700,000,000 a year to maintain
the peace of Europe, and this expense is
constantly increasing. Ii all this vast
sum were devoted to preparations to live
for the future in Christian unity with
each other instead of making ready to
kill with wholesale expedition what a
world this might grow to be of palaces
and gardens, of prosperity and happiness.
Paris might be almost everywhere.
That this is no impossible Utopian
dream is evidenced by the course recently
taken in regard to the Venezuelan dis
agreement between England and America.
It seems to be recognized by great mine's
that war between two such peoples in this
advanced age would be too absurd to be
thought of seriously. If a permanent
treaty of arbitration between these two
powers be not a dream, but almost a cer
tainty of the near future, it does not seem
unreasonable for the people of Europe to
demand an alleviation oi their burdens
by an extension of the system of arbitra
tion to all great civilized powers.
A question of interest in this connec
tion was decided tnis fall by the referen
dum in Switzerland. There was a bill up
for consideration to increase the military
equipment of the little republic which its
opponents called the "Prussianization" of
the country.
The Swiss overwhelmingly voted down
the proposed measure, and thus was a
good example set by tne land which is so
famous for courage, patriotism and love
I of liberty.
"THE CALL" AND THE LOTTERY EVIL.
San Francisco News Letter, November 23.
The Call is doing good work in attempting to break up the lottery evil in this
City. Although expressly forbidden* by low, venders of lottery tickets pursue their
nefarious traffic under the very eyes of the police. If the papers of this Ciiy would
only refuse to print the official list of winning numbers j>eop'e would 'soon pee the
wisdom of keeping their hard-earned dollars in their pockets, instead of throwing
them away.
TRANSMITTERS IN HIS EARS
Wonderful Electric Plant Constructed fob
an Italian Magician.
An Italian magician, Pigliani. has been very
successfully performing a clever trick in Paris
which has earned for him the cognomen of the
"Man Ear." , He has been performing in a very
large hall In Paris and during the evening his*
assistant at the other end of the room finds
some excuse to ask a question of a person in
the audience far away from' the magician on
the - stage. In an ', instant the answer came
from the lip of the magician instead of h!a
assistant to whom it was addressed.; The effect
is very puzzling. It is theu explained that the
magician had anticipated the question by his
The Mystery Explained.
art of mind - reading. The assistant then 1
adroitly selects certain persons who happen to
be sitting near him and gives them the oppor
tunity of asking any question. An each avails
himself of the chance the nnswer comes with
astonishing promptness Irom thr man on the
stage, who is probably fifty feet away. Pig
liani has booked himself on the subjects which
are most l;kely to be dealt with by a ques
tioner and has a grent fund of general knowl
edge which he draws irom. If he dues not
have at hand the information asked for he
says so, but lie does it so quickly thM the effect
is traly puzzling.
The explanation that the man is a mind
reader is only for the jurpose of throwing his
patrons from suap'.'fiiig his real methods;, but
the trick is done I â¢' lie aid of a miniuture
telephone plant Ti.s was constructed for
him by Troupe, the I'tirisian electrician. The
latter exposed the trick after Pigliani ended
his engagement ii. "aris and had started on a
tour of t^ie Continent. It is regarded us a mar
vel of the electric:? n's art. In thu first place
thefloorof the itngc aud the auditorium is
generously Madded with nictnl plates hardjy
larger than a nail head and these are con
nected by wires hanging under the floor. The
magician on the btage wears a heavy wig
which conceals a pair ot tiny rubber-covered
trmisraitters, hardly larger than n dlme.whirh
are fasteneJ in his ears. The necessary wires
are also nidiien by his locks. The wire passes
down under the ciothing and ends in a plate
sunk in the *hoe soie. The confederate wears
a shirt bosom oi a hard, specially prepared
celluloid, which acts as the diaphragm of a
telephone irtuismiUtr. Th.s is fir.cd with the
M'Cessary apparatus and wires the latter ter
minating In the p'.ates in the sola.of the shoe.
As each of the*e men stands &n a couple ol
these lin-ial pliites the circuit is established,
und a whisper uttered in the near presence of
tne >hirt-bosom is carried to Pigliani. The
number of meial plates allows the men 'to
nu/ve around mid Â«vert suspicion. The thing
is simple enough, but no one contemplates
that a telephone plant could be crowded into
so little space.
The illusion which Pigliani has so success
fully secured was destroyed by the electrician
in order that the lutter might get proper
credit for hi* work, whicn is a marvel of
scientific mechanism. He displays a dup'.i
oiite 'phone outfit which he made on the same
lines as> ihe one built for the wizard and it is

SUGAR IN TOBACCO
A very interesting problem was submitted
awhile ago to the Kew authorities, England,
by the Treasury Department. "Does natural
BugpÂ»r occur in tobacco?" was the question,
and striking facts were brought to light The
treasury authorities were interested from a
fiscal point of view, the duly on tobacco (other
than cigars) being a little over $1. except in
the case of sweetehed tobacco, which. is higher,
while sweetened cigarettes are not allowed at
all. Before this investigation it was generally
admitted that tobacco did not contain more
than a trace of saccharine matter.
A scientist made a thorough examination of
the subject. Commercial samples of tobacco,
free from adulteration, were found to contain
over 15 per cent of sugar, while sun-dried
leaves grown at Kew contained over 2 per
cent, others 9 per cent.

A PRINCESSE SHAPE FOR GOWN
OR A RAPPER.
A princesse shape Is always popular, and
with the flaring skirt, the easy sleeves and the
large collars of the present mode has added
charm and comfortableness, for wrappers or
house gowns.
Fabrics of wool are used with a finish of
machine stitching. Others are elaborately
braided. One of brown cloth had the darts
covered by a fancy design which tapered at
the waist and then spread gradually to the
foot of the skirt, where It was eight inches
wide. This was done in black braid with a
giit edge, the braid being sewed on endwise

braided to match.
MÂ«nv women prefer to have such handsome

Probably Matthew Arnold's recently pub
lished letters-will interest the reader in exact
proportion to'-his previous understanding and
appreciation of Arnold life and work. It is
doubtful whether we of to-day realize how j
much of what is taken as a matter oi course in |
our modern way of thinking is due to the in
â fluence of â â â¢Matthew Arnold in the pastâ
â whether we are aware that many of the words
and phrases which aTe now used sogllDly,
' such as "barbarians, " "Philistinism" aud
o'th*rs, were first applied in their present
. "Eetiseby him. A part of his power and influ
'., ence 'lay : ; in those "epoch-making phrases," j
. â wlhich were so trenchant, which so keenly
- characterized a class or a tendency that they
"Â° quickly became common pro[ erty. JohnFiske

â â ourselves, which makes for righteousness.";
. Â°He::it was who spoke of the function of criti

.....It wÂ«s. he who characterized the pagan and
'- Christian ideals as the reign on the one hand ;
.' 6j[ thV: se~nses and the understanding,'' and on

..'classâ the feminine halfâ the one qualifying

"..'â¢fihourd * perhaps be, for s ideal perfection, a

' :Â° It is impossible to mors than suggest these
â¢/Jew points.of Matnew Arnold's philosophy be
l fore coming to the consideration of his letters.
m "It was his express wish that no biography oi
â¢ .him'snould be written. It is now eight years,
â since his death and these are the first of his
, letters, to be published. They are mostly to his
.'.â¢mother, and wife and sisters, and record the
'.labors and the c achievements of a well legu
â¢ lated life. We find nothing tempestuous here,
as in the. letters of poor Carlyie. There is no
laying bare of the heart, no revealing of the
tragedy underlying the commonplace of life.
â¢ ".Happy is that country which hath no his
tory." Mathew Arnold's domestic life seems
to have been singularly serene and unevent
ful. If it had not been we feel pretty certain
he would have put no record of it on paper.
â¢ He., was born in 1822. He showed marked
ability at school, as was to be expected from
the son of bis father, the great Thomas Arnold
'of Rugby. At Oxford he took honors and won
. .-the; Xewdigate prize for a poem on Cromwell.
â  After leaving col.ege he was appointed pri
â  cViite secretary to Lord Lansdown. His letters
"at tnis time to, bis mother and sisters show his
extremely radical views. In one to his mother,
.written in 1848, Â°he says: "The hour of the
â  hereditary peerage and eldest sonshlp and
immense properties has, I am convinced, as
Lrftnartine would say, struck."
His views bcoame somewhat modified with
â  Increasing years, but his attitude was always
(earless and uncompromising. In 1851 ' he
â  â¢was appointed Inspector of Schools, and this |
'eirabled him to marry. These earlier letters
6 how us a good deal of his mind but veiÂ«y little
.of his heart. 0 The first letter to .Miss-Wight
â¢man, who soon after became Mrs. -Arnold, is a
most extraordinary epistle, regarded' in the
â¢' ight bf a. love letter. It contains merely a
â¢.brief and curt record of his doings, and the
' reader*. since*rely hopes that some affectionate
.'â¢passages may have been eliminated before
â¢ 'publication. We understand now, as" never
â¢ beiore. Arnoia 1 *- condensation of poor.Keats'
" love' lettersâ those ardent, passionate, pitiful
â¢'. letters from dying poet to hls sweetheart â
'â¢ which seem hardly to merit so severe a judg
sricnt. We suspect that in his you ,ger years
Matthew Arirold 'was one of those men who
. fear that to be, demonstrative is to be uudigni
, fled. His let tecs express little emotion, even
j though written under what must have been
great e'tress of feeling, as on the death ol his
'. two eons. : The elder, a most lovable* boy, who
bad all his life been a great sufferer, died at
theage of 1(K â¢after a lingering illness. The
. morning aher his death the friend who com
piled these letters tells us that he : found
' Matthew Arnold consoling himself by reading
â Marcus'Aurelius. Four years later the younger
â¢ son die;d very* suddenly, la his eighteenth
year. This second 3 bereavement* was a terri
â  ble grief to both parent*, yet Arnold writes of
It to his;mother.in sternly expressed fashion.
' â¢What his letters do record fully are his men
- tal labors and aspirations. His sister Kathe
-1 rine an.d he were intellectually very congenial.
If is letters to her are far mote interesting than
â¢those to, his wife. He . says in one letter to
Katherine, "You and Clough are, I believe,
1 the two ...people X in my. heart care most to
"please by what I write." â¢ His pet name for
J this sister was "X.' - In a letter to his mother
Â° he speaks of being glad that they all .like his
o latest pdem, "and my darling X., too, my first
reader (or nearer), and who even now has the
â  first p. ace in my heart as a judge of my
o poems.'' In writing to her he Bays: â - "People
do" not understand what a temptation there i*,
if you c cannot bear anything not very good, to
"transfer your operations 'to a. region where
form is everything. ? Perfection of a certain
kind may there be attained, or at least ap
proached, without knocking yours -If to pieces,
but to attain or. approach perfection in the re
glon of thought and feeling and to write this
with pcrfection:of form demands not merely
an effort and a labor, but an actual tearing of
oneself to pieces which one does cot readily
consent to unless one can devote one's whole
life to poetry." His inspectorship of schools
was sad drudgery, which occupied some of the
best years of his life. He was forced to con
tinue in it because his writing at that time
brought him in very little money.
Even after he became greatly distinguished
he was hardly what coirid be called a popular
autbor. He gives an amusing account to his
mother of his interview with the Income- Tax
Commissioners. They assessed his profits ai
Â£1000 a year because he was a "most distib
gnished literary man" and his "works were
mentioned everywhere." Ho answered them,
"You see before you, gentlemen, what you
have often hoard of, an unpopular author!"
The tax was finally cut down to Â£200 a year.
Eveu ihdn lie to.d ihem he should have to
write more iirticles not to be a loser, and the
chairman answered, "Then me public will
have reason to be much obliged to us, Mr.
Arnold." This incident recalls Carlyle's in
terview with these same commissioners â or,
rather, Mrs, Carlyle's interview, for, as usual,
it was she who bore the brunt of practical
affairs.
la 1557 Arnold was elected professor of poe
try at Oxford. His influence in Oxford came
to be very great, succeeding that of Newman.
In his later lite his. writing was mostly prose.
His "Literature and Dogma" and "Culture
and Anarchy" had a tremendous influence
upon contemporary thought. He was an affec
tionate and, as he grew aider, even a demon
strative father. His attitude toward his two
daughters is charming. He wrote long and
interesting letters irom America to his "Dar
ling Nelly." The eldest daughter, Lucy, ac
companied him and "met her fate," as the
saying goes, in New York. They visited this
; country in the winter of 1883-84.
Arnold lectured in most of the Eastern
cities. He was received with great enthusi
asm, but his comments afterward on the
United States were not entirely flattering.
However, our self-love need not be too much
hurt when we remember that he wrote of his
own country as one possessing "an upper
class materialized, a middle class vulgarized,
i and a lower class brutalized." These words
{ occur toward the end of his "Civilization in
America." In speaking of this country, its
present limitation and its future possibilities,
he says: "Distinction and beauty are needs,
aud a civilization is insufficient where these
needs are not satisfied, faulty where they are.
thwarted."
He had & very just estimate of his own
work. In a letter to his mother he says: "My
poems represent on the whole the main move
ment of mind oi the last quarter of a century,
and thus they will probably have their day as
people become conscious to themselves of
what that movement of mind is. and Inter
ested in the literary productions which reil.'Ct
it. It might be tairly urged that I nave less
poetical sentiment than Tennyson, aud less
intellectual vigor and abundance than Brown
ing; yet, because I have perhaps more oi a i
fusion oi the two than either of tnem, and j
have more regularly applied that fusion to the
main line of modern development, 1 am likely
enough to have my turn, as they have had
theirs."
Truly, when we regard the increasing preva
lence of his views and of the philosophy
whJch he taught, we are forced to_admit Unit
working with him is that "Time Spirit" for
whose operations he himself had so Â«reata
respect- grace S. Musseh.
AN EX.RA GOOD ONE
A ROMAXY OF THE SXOWS âBy Gilbert
Parker. New York: Stone <fc KlmbalL For Kale
by Williftni Doxey, Palace Hottl; Drtc $1 26.
This can be recommended to the reader with
out any hesitation. It is clean aa the white
snow of the. fur north, where its characteis
J lived, ann is written with a coloring as warm
as crimson. It is a collection of short stories of
happenings in lands whose cold has made
them an outer wilderness. ' A brief description
of one of these stories will give some idea o'
what the book is like: "Three Commandments
In the Vulgar Toneue" tells the sterv of a
young man in the service, of the Hudson Bay
Company, who offended the governor of the
company and was sent by him to take charge
of a lonely post a thousand miles from arry- I
where, and there for a quarter of a century
"lived Jike a aog on the porch of the world." !
This man Fawdor was thought to have splen- j
did prospects of rising in the company's ser- |
vice. One summer the governor broughr*his I
niece ana nephew out to make a tour of the j
great lakes. The nephew is described as a !
young man "who had a mind .for raillery and
was now and again guilty of some
witty impertinence; but this was hard
to bring, home to him, for he could
assume a fine cnildllke look when he pleased,
confusing to his accusers. ' He was one who
takes "pleasure In dropping nettles more 10
see the weakness of human nature than from
malice." The niece is described as -'a girl
who had a face that would be finer old than
young." Fawdor is intrusted to take charge
of the expedition." On the trip he has the
misfortune to differ with the governor, who
is a well-read man and proud of his reading,
about a quotation from Shakespeare. This
piques the governor and leads to I'awdor's
banishment to a far-off post In Labrador,
where he is forgotten by the tyrant. After
twenty-five years the governor dies. Then
came a letter irom the niece, of which a part
is tDus described by Fawdor: "Then came
another thing so strange that It seems like the
laughter of the angels at us. 'And, dear Mr.
Fawdor, you were both wrong in. that quota
tion.' She was right." Twenty-five years be
fore the worldly wise nephew of the governor
had told FawdOr": "I'd give a hundred editions
the lie, but I'd read the text according to my
chief officer. The words of a King are always
wise while his head is on."

This book coti tains two storiee. "Two Mor
mons From Mudd-lety" and "Alfred's Wife."
The scene is laid in West Virginia. The first
has been published in Harper's Magazine, Â«nd
the second appeared in the Century under the
name of "Lucinda." . '
Thelirstof these stories, to use a common
colloquialism, is "rich." A gigantic back

digestion and a wrong appetite, grows weary
of his lonely life and decides t6 ride to a
neighboring settlement and gat him a wife.
lit- "just reckoned he'd ride across and see if
she looked the game as she did that day,"
when years before he had admired her as a
pretty child. The girl chosen, Dv-lisfta, "could
do jnost anything that \vss no use to ao. She
looked frail, but whipcord wasn't in it." After
a month's courtship tne backwoodsman se
cured his prize and carried her home to Ms
log cabin. She was happy, lor this was her
dretm of a happy. life, which she had formed
from reading tne life of Daniel j oone and
sun) ar tales.
The first night at their cabin home Nic Barr,
the husband, asks his wife to cook some sup
per for tnem. "Of Course I will," she replied,
"but I can't." Now Sic Barr himself was. "the
fllumsiest creature in the world where victuals
were concerned." He taught her all he knew
abou! the culinary art* and then she settled
down to ruin his digestive apparatus as a reg
ular business. Nic could not eat her food ana
began to get so hungry that he could feel
the -'ravin' in the back of his head." He was
a kind man, however, "and had no mind that
she should guess how empty he was." "If *he
tried her best to boot for him he certainly
mv.it try his best to cat what sne prepared,"
but "be wishes to God his hens would lay."
Desperate hunger drives Nic to co get his

ousy and estrangement follow. Next come
two Mormon saints to try to work on the wife's
unhappin^ess aud induce her to go away. They
get a most laughable and terrible panishment
from Nic, which is described in one of the
richest scenes of the story.
, The end Is a beautiful reconciliation be
tween husband and wife after Nic has rea
soned over the situation and remarked to
himself, "I might have had Reuben's wife
come and lessoned her some." "Why didn't I
forgive her when she asked?" "Wny didn't I
kiss her?"
The other story, "Alfred's Wife," telis how
the wife left Alfred to live with another man.
Alfred restrains his desire to kill the seducer
by the consideration that the death would
leave the woman destitute, as neither he nor
htr Jaiher would take her to his home again.
But when thescouudrel forsakes her Alfred fol

MATTHEW ARNOLD.
YONE NOGUCHI, THE
JAPANESE POET, IS
DEFENDED FROM A
CHARGE OF PLAGIARISM.
To the Literary Editor of the Callâ Dear Sir:
I would request the privilege of your columns
to answer the charges of plagiarism brought
against the young Japanese poet, Yone
Noguchi, by the Rev. Jay Thomas Hud
son of Oakland. My claims to a hearing
in the matter are fourfold : to-wit, as a friend
of Mr. Noguchi, as a collaborator with Gelett
Burgess In the editing and publishing of Mr.
Noguchi's poems, aY a devout admirer of Poe
upon whose poems the charges are based, and
as a conternner of plagiarism' and plagiarists.
J. am moved to reply to the attack upon my
friend by an appreciation of his ideas anf.
ideals which are both elevated above the com
mon, nrid hope to show that this Is not an ex
ception to ihe rule that there are two sides to
every question.
Mr. Hudson cites a poem by Mr. Noguohl
pointing out parallelisms between it and "The
Sleeper," by Poe. The similarity is "marked,
the apparent plagiarism undeniable, yet
plagiarism it is not, as I think may be proved.
There is nothing in the charges that Mr. Bur
uess, myself and others did not know. When
Mr. Noguchi's poems were first given to the
public by Mr. Burgess-in the Lark, I culled Mr.
Noguchi's attention to the phrases he had evi
dently learned from reading Poe, and pointed
out the inevitable misjudgment they would
earn for him iv the eyes of critics. Although
unaware of his indebtedness to Poe he readily
acknowledged the possibility of such similari
ties, which, however, he insisted should stand,
since, as far as he was concerned, the poem
was complete, and the words used expressed
to the full his thought, which was not Poe's,
but essentially his own. There are reasons
why we 6hould judge this young Japanese
writer â¢differently irom those who are born
iv d bred to our own tongue, and my defense
of him is bounded upon something more than
the partiality of friendship.
I maintain that there Is nothing in the
charge and this disclaimer that may not be
reconciled if one or two peculiar aspects of the
a way of acting good-naturedly depressive to
their ardor. As she expresses it, she "knew
'ow to guard her honor without 'arshness."
One night she is trying to slip by Captain
O'BalK's room to that of his rival, Mr. Cooper,
"with the coffee-cup in one 'and and me shoes
iv the other, so that Mr. Cooper shouldn't
'ear." But her stealthy steps are heard by the
keen ears of jealousy and a big row between
the rivals results, t^he pacified them tempo
rarily, but that night "Â«f:er we'd all gone to
bed they fought a duel down in the 'all." No
body was killed, but says the distracting
widow, "There would 'aye been, but I hurried
down just, as I was â in a case like that you
can't th nk of what yon 'aye onâ and there I
was begging them not to bloodshed, in my
nightgown, with embroidered ruffles and pink
felt slippers." That calmed them; but "they
'ated each other alter that."
Whoeve* would be made merry with an
hour's readiug let him try this book.

and 1 ondon. Price $i 50. For sale by the Em
porium JJOuk Department.
Here Is another good story from the prolific
pen of Sir Walter Besant. It is well illustrated
by F. S. Wilson. On the cover is the symbol
of folded wings surmounted by a crown with
the motto "Pax." Gilbert, one of the charac
ters we are introduced to, has the singular
power of making every woman who is not
especially mean his friend in an exceedingfy
short space of time. He was a man who could
in all seriousness make up his mind to kill a
man iv order to give freedom to a woman
whom he has reverence for. When he meets
his intended victim he is willing to give the
man a fair chance for his life and so they have
an ordeal by cards. They lay a revolver be
fore them on the table and play cards for the
possession of it. Whoever wins is to take the
weapon and kill the other. Gilbert wins, but
his heart forbids the murder, and he hands
the pistol to his adversary. Gilbert's lady
friend is freed soon after by the suicide of her
husband.
Here is a picture of the woman which gives
a sample of the author's descriptive power:
"A tall and handsome woman; something
reginal in her appearance; a woman born for
authority and high place. Her neck looked as
if diamond? would grace it; her hair looked
as if it wanted the gieam of a coronet; upon
her shoulders lay the queenly drapery of
costly iace. In Tudor days they wouid have
written poetry ab)ut the sunlight in her eyes
ana the tangies of her hair and the blinding
splendor of her face."

This is another of the many books written
after the style of J. M. Barries successful
stories. Because the Scottish dialect is so
pleasing when Barrie makes his characters
case are taken into account. Primarily the
manner of Mr. Noguchi's education should go
far to establish this claim. His remarkable vo
cabulary has been acquired through wide
reading of English poetry, which has
been- to him a rich mine and from which he
has taken words to utilize them with results
that are often marvelous. But if he take gos
samer from Tennyson instead of from the
dictionary, or surgrful Irom Whitman instead
of from Roget's "Tnesaurus," shali we accuse
him of plagiarism? As he has taken single
words 60 has he unwittingly appropriated col
locations of words and phrases which he fits
in here and there to express his individual
thoughts, innocent of the fact that therein
he is committing what, from the view-point of
cold, narrow criticism, is a literary sin. His
Binocence has been his misfortune, for it Can
not be expected that all will understand him
as those well acquainted with him do.
The phrases in the poem cited are undoubt
edly from Poe, anil the poem was undoubtedly
written wnea they were fresh in his mind, but
it was one of his earliest attempts put out be
fore he developed the strongly individual
style that his later work evidences. So well
aware was he of its shortcomings that he
wished to withdraw it from the Philistine, but
a correspondence extending over several
months ta;led to get for him the return of his
manuscript, and the poem was finally pub
lished against his will. The discourtesy to
which he was subjected in the matter by Mr.
Elbert Hubbard of the Philistine has since
been ventilated in several Eastern papers. In
later poems of Mr. Noguchi which have ap
peared from timefto time in the Lark and
have been quoted p your columns, the author
abundantly demonstrates his ability to stand
alone, and his collected writings under the
title of "Seen and Unseen," which are to be
published shortly, will convince even Mr.
Hudson of the strength and originality of his
talent. I am, dear sir, very truly yours,

This is a story of the American Revolution
ary War. It describes the siege and capitula
tion of Yorktown when the British army
marched out between the lines of French and
American soldiers to the tune of the "World
Turned Upside Down."
The main Interest in the story lies in trie
love ' affair and the adventures of Captain
Kenneth. While on. his way to Governor Jef
ferson . bearing important, dispatches from
General de la Fayette his horse gets lame in
the | darkness and rain and mud. He seeks
shelter In a neighboring Virginian mansion,

He escapes by climbing through the big old
fashioned chimney. Shortly afterward the
Tory girl is captured and Kenneth volunteers
to be her escort home. He falls in love with
hh fair enemy. They carry on very active
verbal hostilities on this ana several other oc
casions, but in the end, when Washington cap
tures the British army, Captain Kenneth cap
tures the heart of the Tory girl and all ends
happily.
VERY WORDY.
LOST COUNTESS FALKAâ By Richard Henry
Savage. Rand, McNally it Co., Chicago am
Now York.
This is written in very stagy styleâ
villain still pursued her" sort of staginess.
There is such a profusion of adjectives crowd
ing each other through the sentences that the
mind gets almost dizzy with the swirl of them.
Nearly every paragraph is wildly declamatory.
On every page the exclamation points appear
as thick as falling water drops on a rainy day.
There is such a continuous attempt at being
dramatic that the mind wearies of it. Any
where you open the book such exciting elo
quence as this can be found: "One sudden
suspicion, one single alarm, and the poor
child's tender body would be thrown out in
fragments as carrion to their dogs! Else, de
graded, dishonored, she would be sent off to be
the sport of some brutal Pasha, such as the
beastly Vail of Erzeroum!"
'â¢His face as pale as marble Serge Soltykoff
bore the senseless woman into the open door
of the nearest lodge. Demon, quick-witted
and alert, his senses tuned to the crash of bat
tle and the 'scapes of the field, had caught the
startled cry, 'My God I . That man here. and he
sprang quickly down the sculptured staircase
in search of the tall intruder who had seemed
to menace the Austrian beauty."

ter Btreet, City.
A Scotch story, teaching that a well-meaning
characer with many noble traits can be
strangely mixed with frailty and dishonor. In
this tale the minister owes a debt which be is
temped, while In sore straits, to let go unpaid
by a worldly wise Inactivity of his tongue at a
time when brave and thorough honesty would
have spoken out.
This prevarication Is compared to that of the
unjust steward in the New Testament parabit,
upon which the pastor has bestowed much re
flection. His stricken conscience tries to con
sole itself with the though 1 that, the sin of act
ually sitting down quickly and writing 80
when the debt was really 100 was not
actually committed, but the similarity of the
offense gradually forces itself upon his con
sciousness, and then he realizes what hell
means.
Speaking of the Calvini9tic creed the author
ess tays that the literary class holds it as the
c rigin of all evil, but she has not found it to
be so, "perhaps because dogmatic tenets hold,
after all, but a small place in human hearts,
aud the milk of human kindness Hows inde
pendent of all the rulos of theology."

Uoituauu, City.
Here is another of the many good military
stories by Captain King. It tells of the
troublous times of the great Chicago striae
and riot, but the title of the book ha* refer
ence not to the quiet quelling of that mob,
but to the capture of a girl's heart. This cap
ture was not effected speedily, nor was the
heroine very tame that made the surrender at
last. When this happened she was under the
mistletoe and he said : "If it were only.Christ
mas time again I'd claim the privilege of the
mistletoe." Her capitulation was couched in
these terms: "Is it potent only at Christmas?"
One of the good things in the book is where
the incident is described of the regular troops
sternly repressing all temptation to use their
bayonets or bullets on a disobedient aud jeer
ing crowd, but nevertheless triumphantly
conquering by getting the hose in readiness to
cool off the crowd aud clear the space with
water. The splendid discipline of the regulars
in the face of most exusperating Insults is told
in a way to excite our admiration for the men
who guard property against mob violence.
MUSK'S POWER.
A MATTER OF TEMPERAMENT- By Ed
ward In-nseus Stevenson. American Pub
lishers' I orporation, .New York Price 81.
This book deals with the problem of the re
lation of music to morals. Love, music and
the stage all take part in the production of a
great moral tragedy. The time is the middle
of tne nineteenth century, when the great suc
cess of Meyerbeer was having so much influ
ence on composers. Meyerbeer himself is a
part of the story.
The book is a study of a grave Impeachment
of music, as also directly and indirectly
against its exponents. There is no doubt
about the good influences of music in the
earth. It rouses religious feeling sometimes
where no words could do any benefit. Again,
some kinds of it stir up high resolves to do
arduous and dangerous duties. But it seems
that there is a bad side to it as well. The
claim is mHde that there is music which with
out words excites the baser possibilities of the
human heart. Also there is a sort of intoxica
tion in It which should be avoided as excess
of the wine cup. The rousing of immoderate
emotion results in weakness. Its powers for
good and evil should be closuly studied as a
moral question by those who teach it and by
those who move men "with concord of sweet
sounds,"

mous. Stone ifc KitniiaM, New York. Price
fl 50. For sale by William Doxey, Palace Ho
tel, City.
The title of this book must be used in irony.
It should otherwise be called "Rascality Re
warded," for James, who is a consummate ras
cal, ends his scries of betrayals by getting a
farm and the farmer's daughter for a wife,
witn the addition of the respect of his neigh
bors, and his "walk is Considered the most
edifying in the State of Illinois." The virtu
ous wife of his former days of prosperous ras
cality gets the worst of the story.
The story is rather commonplace, forcing
upon the reader's attention a lot of contempti
ble, petty people, who are not worth the know
ing. Tom Walton and his wife are exceptlous,
but there is not enough of them to d to make
a full offset to the weary, unbrilliant wick
edness of the others. ThR book's main merit
is the writer' 3 exceeding fluency. Some pages
of it are worth the reading just for the sake of
the great flow of language. If the author had
known a better story his abundance of words
wherewith to tell it might have made a combi
nation of considerable literary charm.

HOLIDAY LITERATURE
BOOKS OF YULETIDE
In the December Overland Ronnsevelle
Wildman devotes his "Sanctum Talk" to the
present fad of forming societies ot "sons" and
"daughters" of the Revolution, the French
and Indian wars and other wars. The leading
article of the month is by Rev. W. Boltou,
A.M., rector of the Church of St. Mary the
Virgin of San Francisco, who writes of his re
cent explorations and discoveries on- the
island ot Vancouver under the caption of
"Exploring the Northern Jungles." The article
is tho first of a series and is illustrated
from photographs by the uuthor, which are
the first ever taken. Edward Steptoe relates
a thrilling and unwritten incident in Utah's
history, of "How Brigham Young Was Ar
rested for Polygamy." Charles E. Naylor con
tinues his powerful attacks on "Compulsory
Pilotage in San Francisco;" accompanying the
series are a valuable set of half-tone reproduc
tions of harbor views. W. J. Corbet, member
of Parliament, concludes his remarkable ar
ticle on "England and Ireland* that has at
tracted so much attention among the Irish
throughout the country. Among other con
tributors are Dr. L. G. Yates on "Indian Plc
toglyphs," Joaquin Miller, Verner Z. Reed and
Batterman Lindsay. The artistic end of the
"Overland" is taken in hand with pronounced
success by Pierre N. Boeriuger, who contrib
utes several noteworthy sketches to this issue.
The make-up of the magazine is much im
proved, too.
.in the December issue of Llppincott's the
following are articles of Interest: "ThÃ Whip
ping of Uncle Henry," a tale of Georgia before
the war, in that original and effective vein
which is peculiar to Will N. Harben. Pauline
Shackleford Colyar tells a Thanksgiving story
of "Two Oid Boys." "How Timmy Saved the
Piece." by Livingston B. Morse, records a re
markable event in theatrical annals of the
humbler sort. The methods of "Shutting Out
the Sea" are set forth by George Etbelbert
Walsh. D. C. Macdonald writes on "'The Land
of Taffy," the other name of which is Wales.
George J. Varney gives the history of "Our
First Silver Mine," and David Bruce Fitzgerald
describes "An old Virginia Fox Hunt." "The
Evolution of the Poster" is traced by Agnes
Carr Sage from the beginnings of advertising,
so far as known. Arthur Inkersley discusses
"Anagrams." Jean Wright has a lively essay
on "Flirtation as a Fine Art. " The poetry of
the number is by. Elizabeth Crooks, Grace F.
Pennypacker, Emma C. Dowd aud Arthur D.
F. Randolph.
There Is said to be new biographical matter
about Charles and Mary Lamb, as well as
hitherto unpublished letters from the brother
and sister, in a book which W. C. Hazlitt has
sent to tl*e press. The volume is to be entitled
â¢'The Lambs, Their Lives, Their Friends and
Their Correspondents."
Godey's Magazine for December has an
especial Christmas-time flavor. The frontis
piece is a reproduction of the splendid paint
ing of Glierardo della Notte, "The Adoration
of the Shepherds'," a picture never before
given in an American magazine. Following
this is an illustrated series, "The First Christ
mas," by C. F. Lester, who builds his pictures
upon the text of the Scriptures. "And there
were in tho same country shepherds abiding
in the field, keeping watch over their flock by
night, etc.," a noble tnc-me to which the artist
has added the charm of his art with line effect.
To those who dwell upon the coming of the
Christmastide with reverence these pictures
will appeal very strongly. They certainly
compose a fine collection and are worthy to be
preserved.
The Forum for December 1 will contain a
noteworthy symposium on "The Electionâ lts
Lessons and Its Warnings." The first paper
in the group is contributed by the Hon.
Andrew D. White, who, in a very valuable and
suggestive article, sets forth some of "The
Practical Lessons of the Recent Campaign." Dr.
White is followed by D. MacGregor Means, a
well-known publicist of New York, who, under
the title "Will Government by the People
Endure?" analyzes the causes of discontent
which led to tne recent crisis. Professor Gold
win Smith, completes the trilogy with a paper
entitled "The Brewing of the Storm," in which
be discusses the recent crisis from the point of
view of an outsider.
Mme. Virginie Demont-Breton, daughter of
the celebrated French artist, Jules Breton, her
self an artist and the wife of an artist, is the
only woman painter since Rosa Bonheur to re
ceive the cross of the Legion of Honor. Mrs.
Henry Bacon contributes a sketch of Mme.
Demont-Breton to the Christmas Century
under the title of "A Painter of Motherhood."
The article is accompanied by reproductions
of a number of the artist's noted pictures of
child life.
The publishets of McClure's Magazine an
nounce a Christmas number of quite extra
ordinary quality, both in its reading matter
and its pictures. Among the contributors will
be Rudyard Kipling, lan Maclaren, Harriet
Prescott Spofford, Frank R. Stockton, Hamlin
Garland, Henry Seton Merriman, Cyrus C.
Adams of the New York Sun, and William

ment-house districts. For the Christmas Cen
tury he has written a paper on "Light in Dark
Places," showing the reforms that have been
accomplished under recent legislation in
clearing out the worst of the congested spots
in New York.
Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly is the first

No living authors have won boys' hearts
more completely nor held them so long as has
this trio of-Castiemon, Alger and Ellis, and it
is said that no juvenile books are more in
demand at the libraries. Popularity is per
haps not a test of merit, but boys are 'dis
criminating readers and are not easily de
ceived by books of an inferior order. We
therefore conclude that these writers have
qualities that make their works worth reading.

This is a pretty gift book for the youngsters,
consisting ol a nice collection of short stories
about birds and animals which talk entertain
ingly. The tales are told in such a way as to
be instructive in natural history, and are fairly
crowded with amusing illustrations. Here is
some talk from Mr. Robin: "I think in tha
beginning," continued the Robin, placidly,
"the reason the House People liked me was
because I was somehow confused with my
English relative, Robin Redbreast, who is
famous In histoiy for having so kindly fur
nished a leaf quilt to the poor Babes In the
Wood, and who, later on, was the victim of the
tragedy we are now celebrating. Now my
cousin Robin Redbreast had the advantage of
me in personal beauty, as his children have to
this day, being smaller, sleeker, brighter in
color, in shape more like the Bluebird."

â¢ â¢ l^dfjUCH time and thought, to say
Ij^lj^l 'nothing of lucre, is now beina
o o J^t[^ expended on chic and- beauti
ful toilets for the fair debutantes, and
Iâ¢â in proportion I do not consider that
' o sufficient 'â¢ of any one of these three
t * requisites for success is spent on the se
lecting and ordering of. their wraps, there
-â¢ fore I have secured lor them descriptions
of several models of capes, cloaks and a
new pelerine, which is such a delightful
creation that it makes me feel like keeping
the composition just for my dearest
'â Â° friends. All these models originated in
0 either London or Paris. The fur-lined bro
caded cape is not only a handsome but a
most useful article of apparel â it can be
Â« # so easily discarded on entering a warm or
overcrowded room. This pattern may be
Â°Â» carried out in a great variety of fabrics,
. .' but the one which received the highest
commendation in London was of a black
â¢ ,: velvet sprayed with dull red roses with
their leaves. The lining of fur makes it
most comfortable round the throat, and
â¢â¢ down the front extend trimmings of blacK
E Thibet goat. For morning wear only
; Â° cloth can be substituted for the brocade.
â¢ .% Â° Velvet is also in vogue, and it is cheaper
. this season than ever before. ' The pelerine
i is composed of ermine, and breitschwautz,
3 most exquisite embroidery, completes it.
[ The muff matches. The cut is beautifulâ
\liow gradually the collar slopes; aud at
.- the waist line is a buckle composed of dia
Â° monds and emeralds set in dull gold, in
Â° itself a work of art. The lining is of lus-
I trous white satin. When rare lace ap
>â  plique takes the place 61 the embroidery,
' this innocent little wrap becomes too
â  costly for ,auy not richly endowed with
. this \s orld'a goods. However, so perfect
: is the shape that it will suggest many de
lightful possibilities to our bright girls.
iâ¢ ' One of the handsorae-t opera cloaks re
* cently remarked in Paris is here depicted,
V for I am giving only examples, models of
, , garments that have made the critical and
best-dressed of women a trifle more beauti-
Â° o ful and attractive than ever. This one is
p' o in Opbelie velvet, with an application of
Luxenil," lined and trimmed with the love-
J;est of chinchilla, that most deiiciously
Â° becoming and comfortable fur. Note the
â¢ aigrette in my lady's hair; it springs, ap
* parently, from a jeweled ornament con
sisting of a great turquoise surrounded
â¢ with diamonds. Each tiny spray of this
. aigrette sparkles with gems. Such a cloak
o any woman would love to possess, bat I
would not be surprised to hear its praises
sung in some .Eastern fashion journal a

\ Â°Â°A sortie de bal, of white satin lined
Â° with' the new pinky matfvre- shade in
1 satin was admired recently at the opera.
'" Over it was draped a long dalmatic in
white, lampas brocaded with small
Â° flounces- of mousseline de soie, covered
with a golden guipure. " It was completed
by a high collar and long waistcoat of

Â°Â° o Â°' Girls, the next time you are in England
0 be sure to secure a Simla cloak, for this
o "Simla" fabric, fashioned of two cloths
â¢woven together, is as light as a feather,
o being of .aÂ° soft cashmere wool. The
, Tsaritsa ordered a cloak during her re
cent vis.it from Scott Adie. wno alone
Â»- makes thecloth, which may truly be said to
* o be a fabric de luxe, and it is as suitable for
. day as- the evening. Even the cold blasts
â â¢. of a St. Petersburg winter will not be suf
-0 ficiently penetrating to pierce the gar
-1 ment ordered by her Majesty, for it also i
has. a lining of padded heliotrope". brocade
covered with sprays of heliotrope. .The
iur that forms the collar and extends
â  down the front is composed of the skin of
an extremely rare Finland fox, Â»nd al
though of a biscnit color, is called "bine
fox.'* Very smart is a driving coat of a
good fawn cloth,' lined throughout with
gray and white real squirrel fur and '
o trimmed, with a deep collar and large
revers of mink fur. This model was on a
dummy at a Regent-street store, and I as*
o sure you : it was very swell, being strictly
tailor-made, and what do you think of the
price, $60? 0 " Â»
6 L. must also chronicle the fact
o that many of the 'most lovely
evening cloaks are this* season made
of chiffon, which at first seems ab
surd â¢ considering the icy>inds they are
presumed to shield us from, but on inves
tigation they prove highly satisfactory as
the chiffon is merely kilted over a founda
tion cape of 0 Satin, which is lined with
' o ermfhe. Insertions' and ; laces frequently
stripe the chiffon and add a few more five
Â° dollars to the costly trifles.
Â°Â° Another extravagant but exceedingly
pretty cloak may be made out of chine
â¢ o brocade with a 'white gronml. lined
throughout with white Mongolian goat,
the large collar of this being cut In Medicis
form to turn up round the neck. Scarcely
less economical is a coat in the empire
style reaching to the hem of the gown, !
made of black satin lined with white bro
cade trimmed with real lace, and a collar
Â° o of-aable, cuffs of sabhe finishing the blouse
sleeves of this. Another suggestion for on ;
3 evening cloak is torquiio blue- watered
â¢ poplin" traced with silver sequin*, lined
with gable, and boasting a sable col'ar at
the neck. Sable and ermine are the only
furÂ« suitable for wearing in ; the evening
and thibet maybe cordially recognized
too, but this only looks well in while, and
when allowed to form the lining as well a3
the collar.
On the whole, the theater cloaks this
year are prettier than they have been .lor
many seasons; and as. a lust example of
the truth of this let me â  quote a coat in
*ac shape hanging from the neck, made of
. black sa tin, covered . with a . running ap
plique of ecru lace, this lined with azure
blue satin, the collar of chincilla, â by"
the way I have forgot to say chinchilla is
an, admissible fur in the eveningâ looks
quite. lovely.

1 Much of the information I have given yot
! you will appreciate if yoa attend the com
ing horÂ«Â»e show. Felix created the gor
geous dress worn by Marie Pia. tne
; Dowager Queen of Portugal, at tlie wed
<iinÂ«j of Hie DnKe of Orleans and the
' Princess Marie of Austria. The satin, the
: magnificent brocade, the supero lace and
jewels left nothing to be desired. Note
| the exquisite cut of the skirr, the two
' points of the bodice in front and the
: quaint sleeves. This model may well ba
' studied by those about to order a baiul
' some evening gown, and says a corre
, pondent:
"Some of the dresses made by Worth
1 for Maria Pia, Dowaper Queen of Portu-
I pal, to wear at the wedding festivities at
Rome were extremely beautiful. A rich
lampas, the st)a>ie of the Parma violet,
was covered with a mounting pattern of
sjirays of roses. The siightly trained skirt
was ornamented on end side with an em
broidery in amethysts simulating the
eun'3 rays. The double-pointed bodice
was high at the back, but cut square in
front, with a demi-cherusque of old point
d'Arpent-an and tints of violets placed
here and there in the lace. Long sleeves,
rather full at the top. They are worked
with amethysts to match the skirt, and a
sort of fulling of leee at the top.
"An evening dress has a raised pattern
in white velvet on a mauve satin ground
shot with silver. The design was copied
from some Persian material and is so
large that it takes up the whole of the
length of the skirt, and the front has a
tablier worked with diamonds. The skirt
is long at the back; the pointed bodice,
in the pompadour style, irj low ami edged
round with diamond embroidery in van
dykes on white tulle. Below this falls a
berthe ol Alencon lace worked with dia
monds ana draped on the shoulders with
sprays of orchids "
Fancy Dress Cotillon.
Numerous are the belles interested in
a discussion of toilets for the fancy dre*s
cotillon which will take place next month.
Thus far but few have ordered their
powns. However, if all the present idÂ»as
take a material form a very beautiful
| sight will be witnessed on that eventful i
: evening, for ladies df high degree, to say !
! nothing of a few Princesses, will tread j
| with a historic grace the mazes of tne j
; dance. Old paintings, miniatures and j
! h. stories have all been diligently searched !
of late for suggestions and ideas. Now |
for a little advice: There will he nothing 'â â 
economical in purchasing cheap fabrics,
for the cost of making is the main consid
eration, and if a small amount of discre
tion is used the toilet can be readily
altered so as to make it perfectly modern
at a trifling expenditure. For example,
take a handsome Watteau model. Rich
satin, brocade and Jace are requisite. The
skin and waistcoat are of saiin; flounces,
five in number, caught up here and there
I with ribbons and flowers, adorn the skirt.
I The "overdress" is really cut a la princess,
with a wide watteau pleat in the back;
it may be of ; either silk or brocade. It
j has short panier fronts which are caught
| irp at the si<Jes so as to give^it a bunchy
! effect, and the -sqnare-cut neck opens on
] a plain satin pointed vest, buttoned down .
j the front. The top of this vest is beauti
{ fied by a ruche of lace; a ruche also bor
ders the entire" overdress.
â¢ The watteau train is s-et in a treble box
pleat .between the shoulders and turns
under about half way from the waist, as a
pouf. The train may be either caught up
with flowers, ribbons, etc., or be allowed
to fall straight. Ljce edges the elbow
sleeves and a black velvet band must sur
round the tfiroat. The slippers should be
of the brocade. Th"c powdered hair has at
the side a cluster of flowers. Such a dress
can readily be altered by a good dress
-1 maker and uo exct-Jlently well on numer
ous occasions. If a hat is worn it must
he trimmed with either ostrich" plumes or
ribbon and flowers and be Gainsboroueb j
in shape: and speaking of this hat, re- I
minds me that a Gainsborough costume I
would be very effective. Consult any of his
famous portraitsâ for instance try, if be
coming, a rose pink satin trained skirt,
and a long overskirt of a cream silk,'
brocaded or -sprayed with pink blos
soms and their greeu leaves, long

I sleeves and bodice of the same.
| The hair Diust be powdered and turned off
tie face in a laÂ£ge roll, fuller at the sides
than the top, the curled ends falling on the
shoulders. Very large true Gainsborougli
hat of black o/ colored velvet with great
plumes must be worn, and high-heeled
slippers and almoiu^colored kid mittens
complete this toilet. L,ady Barbara'Yelver

i but remember these facts, powder was not
I worn in England until tlie reign of
j James I, and higb-heeled shoes were un
known until the reign of Elizabeth.
Gloves were unheard of until the tenth
century. Until the Virgin Queen mounted
the throne the hair was parted in the
middle and either allowed to float on the
shoulders or was bound up under a coif.
Elizabeth introdnced padding and frizz

curls was worn over thÂ«> forehead and lone
ringlets at the back. Never wear a wig if
you can aVoid it: they are most unbecom
ing, for one thing. You may ihink from
seeing them on the stage that such is not
the case, but remember that distance
lends enchantment, and as you expect to
dance you certainly have to stand a close
inspection, and, besides, a wig almost
always gives the wearer a memorable
headache, as it hrats the head greatly.
Adverse as I am on any occasion to recom
mending rouge, I know it is an absolute
necessity when the hair is powde*rec!, on
less the wearer's coloring is more than
usually brilliant. You wiil all probably
conclude before long that the prepara
tions for a fancy-dress ball are not quite
as simple as some imagine, for Ihey re
quire much prearrangement.
Chit-Chat.
Nowadays a bridesmaid's bouquet must
be large and tied with yards of ribbon, as
the ends must L-e very long. If carnations
are used, about fifty, intermingled with
maiden's hair, wiil be sufficient ; if roses,
and they are Jarge, twenty-five will be
enough, as any clumsy effect must be
avoided.
According to the strictest rules of eti
quette, "an invitation to a church wed
ding alone demands no acknowledg
ment."
The Russian coronation cups are to be
given as favors at a cotillon shortly. It
has been suggested that owing to the near
approach to Christmas, they should bs
filled with crimson carnation*.
I thoroughly agree with the well-known
authority who remarked a few days ago:
"Finger-bowis are useless wben fruit is
not served, and many persons are of the
opinion that in no circumstances nre they
good form, their use being in the nature
of a toilet operation, which is not in place
at dinner."
Persons married in travel garb have for
attendants only a best man and maid of
honor. Even when a couple are to start
at once on a journey, if they are married
at home, the bride and groom should both
be in evening dress, as it takes but so
short a time to make the necessary change
and a traveling dress for a bride in the
evening is, tÂ© say the least, extremely try
ing.
Small almost square thin cards are the
most fashionable for women.
.Models fop a Tpousseau.
Have most of !hem originated in Paris.
One striking costume has a draped bodire
in leaf-green bengaline. The small slightly
fulled vest is of white mousseline de soie
bouiilonne and trimmed with ecru guip
ure. Kound tbe skirt are eight flounces of
mousseline de soie edged with black velvet.
Similar flounces flare out from the shoul
ders in a sprightly manner, exienainc
over the glove-fitting sleeves. They are
five in number. At the elbows are five
more. The fact is that although this
creation is a decided novelty it is rather
hideous, I think. The collar is shaped
like two crescents and reachep almost to
the top of the ear?. A more useful frock
is composed of a new weave of cloth cf a
rich crimson. *\ve V-shaped bands of
velvet trim the skirt, arranged at an equal
distance. Jhe bodice is tut like a Louis
XVI jacket and has three jeweled
buttons on either side. The collar is
more like a little cape, and is edged with
an accordion-pleated -ruffle, of changeable
taffeia silk. This also lines the dress and
varies from black to green, from green to
black. This cape-like collar extends in
pretty points down the lront, but the vest
is of delicately embroidered white chiffon,
most gracefully draped across the figure.
Very unique in effect is a cape of corai
colored taffeta, trimmed With long hori
zontal ba:ids of black velvet, Russian sa
bie and diamond buckles, very original
coquille forming wlags. The velvet bands
are cut on the loss of the material. With
tliis .goes a black velvd skirt, trimmed
with a rather wide band of sable placed
about eighteen inches Jrom tbe bottom.
The Duchess is evidently a tall woman
from the number or lines of trimming in
troduced in every possible way to give her
width. Thus far these are tbe only gar
ments I have heard about for this Drido,
but from the same capital comes news of
a visiting toilet of souris taffeta, trimmed
with white lace, which descriDes epau
lets, covers the softly folded belt of rib
bon and is gathered into a ciiou bow at
the back. The bolero has fan-shaped re
vers and cloven pp:iulets in silver and
gold Japanese embroidery and edged with
tinsel balls to match. The hat of gray
i It is trimmed with a handsome cluster
of black os'rich plumes, and some softly
folded white satin, covered with black
txille, encircles the Town.
Extremely odd is a costume of dark
green cloth. The collar, of a marvelous
cut, is known as the "liobert Macaire. " It
is Jined with Ualmoral tartan, which
matches the incroyable revers and the
minute frills and fixings. The draped beit
is of black velvet. The grecu felt Amazon
hat is adorned witii bunds of bJ.icic velvet
and ostiich tips. A "directoire" town is
in excellent tasie. It also is of green
cloth, which is enhanced with some mwt
artistic black binding. This is about six
teen inches deep around its hem, and be
low it is a band of Astrakhan fur. which
forms the blouse fronts as well. Red silk
lines ihe high collar and tbe entire gar
ment. It also forms the belt, which ter
minates in a sort of windmill bow, with a
lovely antique jeweled center. Braided
cloth makes an effective neckband end a
straight front. The hat is extremely
ugly, so I omit a description, but this
fact is noticeableâ felts are being very
generally worn this winter.
Fur is playing its part in millinery.
Narrow bands of sable or mink border
green velvet toques and bonnet?, often in
terblended with. a white satin foundation
for the embroidery, in which gold and
turquoise fire combined, or steel and jet,
the inevitable paste ornament finding a
place at the back or front, or perhaps
both. The diamond-shaped crowns of
velvet of some light coior, on white satin
worked in gold and silver, are frequently
iccompanird by black velvet brims, and
we have happily not forgotieti the com
fortable Dutch shape, which shows off vel
ret so well. Marcella.
Styles fop Men.
Round-toed black leather walking boots
laced are universally worn. With after
loon dress patent leather buttoned walk
.n<r boots are correct and for the evening
patent leather pumps. Some of the covert
:oats, jiftt out from London, are of a cloth
mown as "Venetian," which has been
endered waterproof owing to the chem
cal action of an acid. They are cut very
oose and have broad backs. Down the
enter of the back is placed a broad band
md the cuff? are finished in the same
tvle of sti ching. Such coats are not
lined and have but one breast pocket.
A man in deep mourning must wear
>tack ploves only. Thick black drivine
;loves of dogskin are made by Dent. As
soon as the mourning is lightened gray
suede gloves are correct.
The velvet collar is scarcely ever now
seen on evening coats, as it was a fad that
lasted but for a moment, one might say,
and was at once frowned upon by the men
who valued their reputation ;or smart
dressing. The collars of the best evening
coats are made of cloth with the silk
lining within half an inch of the lapel.
Collars, I hear, are growing higher and
rpmain stiff and straight. The colored
shirt ia gradually vanishing.
Concerning ties Him informs us: I had
expected to see some exhibition of new
ties, but so fiir there is little, to notice.
The old greens and blues, dark, almost
black, with raised figures in the same pat
terns, are not noveities, but they are all
that one sees offered these days. I won
der that silk neckwear manufacturers,
like the carpet men and the wallpaper
dealers, will not employ really artistic de
signers. lam weary of the fleur-de-lis, the
polka dot. the crescent and tire disguised
horscslioe; and as for the little white or.
yellow flowers I do not care to gaz* on
their, like again. I feel after I look qt a
selection of silks just as if I had fixed my
vision on blank space for awhile and then
suddenly closed my eyes. Now and then
tbe patterns do resemble the impres
sions one gets when he receives a knock
down blowâ stars and zig-zags.
A young man ask^ Vogue this week if
with propriety he cen ask permission to
ca!l on a young iady. I have so frequently
been questioned on t:us subject ; hat I can
rot do better t!mn quote the full reply,
"There is no rule. Any person who dog
matically pronounces judgment in such
matters is absurd.
"Your question is not one so much of
etiquette as of human nature and good
nmnners. A man wno in all circumstances
waits until a woman asks him to call is a
prig. A man wno forces his acquaintance
upon any one, man or woman, is a bore
and a nuisance.
"When a lady wants a gentleman to
Call, or a gentleman wishes to call, they
find some natural way of making the
mutual wish known to one another. This
is when there is a friend.'y relation, a
personal interest. When no such relation
exists, a man calls only when ho is asked,
or as the r* suit of some civility extended
to him ; for example, an invitation to call
in response to a letter of introduction that
he has had delivered to the woman, or
after getting a card to a tea, or a reception
cr after a dinner. In such cases he calls,
as a matter of course, and he calls
promptly. If he does not make his first
cafi witnin a week, or fails to call at all,
he is rude.
"Perhaps this extended reply gives you
the full idea; namely, that by standards
of formality the man must wait lor an
inviiattioÃ that requires a subsfquent
call; or must wait for a direct invitation

Tke j^ed Gross Ambulance of the Sea Will J^limster
r to tke Wourded Warriors' Needs.
Ati: ambulance ship to aid wounded and
drowning men during a naval engage
ment is the latest addition it is proposed
to make to the United States navy. The
s ivocates oi this project are\Surt;eon-Gen
t ral Rulus Tryon and Hilary A. Herbert,
fc\ti retary of the Navy. Both believe, and
iliey have facts and hgurea to prove their J
statement, that such a craft would save j
t c lives of 50 per cent of the injured, in a
naval conflict, who would probably die
under the present methods of caring for
t-h.em..
It will be no light task that the ambu
lance ship and her men will have to per
form. It is dangerous to be in the vicin
ity of shot and shell, even though not the
target. These men, however, will have
to face death in order to save life, and
courage will be quite as necessary a
requisite for the man attached to the am
bulance ship as for any member of any
mess on board a cruiser.
It has always been the case, even under
the most advanced methods, that during
battle on board ship it has been impossi
ble to render immediate aid to the
â wonnded. It is just this sort of aid that
saves life, for never is delay more danger
ous than when it prevents a wounded man
from receiving the necessary attention.
As a matter of fact the handling of
wounded on ships-of-war is a subject
which is engrossing the attention of the
naval authorites of the world. In view
Qf this fact Surgeon General Tryon's idea
is of the greatest importance. The ves
sels to be utilized for this service must be
swift steamers of fairly good capacity, so
far as room for the sick is concerned, and
yet not of too large size to prevent ouick
turning and rapid darting arouuu and
among a fleet of vessels.
The chief necessity for un ambulance
ship lies in the fact that it promotes
celerity in handling the wounded. That
is practically the sum total of the value of
the service. The modern warship, so
long as it remains above water, ha 3 fair
accommodations for such members of its
.cre.w as may receive injuries during con
flict. Circumstances, however, render it
absolutely impo-sible even with a care
.fully trained medical corps to render aid
as soon as necessary. There is> always the
dalige>, too, that members of the hospital
.brigade may be injured by Eome missile
of yaf. In any event, there would hardly
be as much risk for the members of the
crew of the ambulance ship as for those
on board the vessel that has been under
Mire;. -The treatment of the crew of such a
craft would be precisely that accorded the
â¢Bed Cross brigade. It is an unwritten
law of every civilized nation that a
wounded man tod the man who aids him
are both to be protected.
Again, it is always the case in naval
conflicts that a number of the men
FIRE DEPARTMENT ON BIKES MOW.
Tke Bicvjcle a Vehicle of Practical Use for the Volun
teer SerVice.
The cities of the United States 'are to
lea I the world in the introduction of a
-.complete tire department on bicyclea^At
trte i resent moment a Racine ("W^wT) firm
of bicycle-makers is preparing to equip,
in every detail, a first-class tiro depart
, inent with wheels. These wheels are not
â¢sinipiy for the firemen to ride when they
like, but fhe fire apparatus itself is at
tached to them, and when the alarm
{sounds the firemen, instead of being
â¢ drawn to the scene of flame and smoke by
plunging horses, will scorch both them-
Belyes and .their apparatus to the point of
â¢ destination.
.*â¢ This is no inventor's dream, but a fact
.that is as practical as a grindstone. The
ide 3of applying the bicycle principle to
the rapid locomotion of vehicles has been |
given profound consideration by many
persons. The^quipment of a fire depart
ment apparatus with a bicycle attach
ment is one of the fiuits of this campaign
of thought.
Accurate representations of fire ap- i
|paratus mounted on bicycles will be seen |
\n the illustration accompanying tbis
article. In ev^ry instance pictured ma
chines have already been constructed pre
cisely as shown. The mest notable fea
ture of the apparatus, and by far the most
elaborate, is the bicycle chemical engine.
It is built on the tandem pattern, al- I
though there, are accommodations for!
I who are injured are blown into the writer.
j Oftentimes it nlso appears that uninjured
men fall from the rigging into the ocian.
It is a curious fact that thiee-fifths of the
eailors in the different navies caunot swim,
ami, therefore, in runny instances todmp
irom the rigging or to be acciuen tally fore d
I overboard during buttle is just as s-u:e
j death as to stop a bullet. Now the men
on board the ambulance ship will be look
ing for just such accidents ail the time, and
boats' crews would be instantly dispatched
if such aid were needed.
A:i instance of the percentage of life
that would be saved by having boats in j
constant readiness to aid men who have
fallen overboard and are drownine is
shown by the iact that during the last
naval battle between Austrian and Italian
fleets thirty years ago more than 400 men
were drowned who could have easily been
saved had an ambulance ship been in
attendance. The facilities for saving men
who co overboard during a battle are no
greater now than they were at that time.
The methods of naval warfare have be
come more deadly, and the percentage of
killed is frequently greater, but there is
no abatement of the confusion existing on
board a vessel while in action, and no
matter what ideas are suggested, there is
nothing that will change the attitude of
men in naval battles from what it has been
for a century.
These facts taken into consideration, it
Is held by most competent naval authori
ties tliat the necessity for the ambulance
ship is so plain tuat he who sails may see.
As stated the vessels used for the purpose
must be swift and easily handled. Of I
necessity they must also be first-class sea
boats, and there is many a merchant
steamer running out of American ports
to-day that will answer this description to
the letter.
It is proposed tnat the ambulance ships
which Surge on- General Tryon and Secre
tary Herbert would have the United
States Government construct or purchase
shall be totted up like naval hospitals. The
ships shall Decontrolled by "a naval am
bulance assaciation for the treatment of
the sick and wounded at sea.' The idea
is precisely that of the St. John's Ambu
lance Association, so called. While the
Government would, of course, extend pa
ternal protection over such aa ambulance
service aid would be extended to the
wounded whettur friend or foe. The am
bulance ship would truly be a ship of
mercy.
The plan that is suggested for the ship
is to devote the spar deck, that is the decs
where there is the greatest amount ot air,
to the most serious cases, of both officers
and men. T- c additional wards will be
located on the remaining decks of the
vessel. As it is always more or less close
between decks, artificial ventilation will i
three wheelmen. The engine iÂ» exactly
similar to that in use by many of the fire
departments in the country. It is equipped
with the regulation lanterns, fire uxts,
crowbars, pike poles, etc. The engine
carries also the regular chemical fluid. It
has attracted wide attention among those
who have had their attention drawn to it,
and really promises to become exceed
ingly popular.
The attention of veteran fire-men the
country over has been turned to the bicy
cle fire apparatus, and the consensus of
opinion seems to be that no adequate
reason can be advanced to prove that it is
not practical. The picture herewith shows
conclusively that no reason exists why the
idea, as illustrated at liacine, is not as

practical as the purchasing value of a $20
gold piece. It will be observed that the
liremen in the rear who help propel the
machine are riding in a fashion that indi
cates a -gigantic tricycle, rather than a
bicycle. The rider in front is the one who
is scorching, and if appearances justify
opinions, he has by no means the lightest
task to perform..
The hose cart with its clanging bell,
when equipped with the bicycle attach
ment, becomes again the hose reel. It is
propelled by three riders, in much the
same manner as the chemical engine.
Being much lighter, however, the pace is
far greater and it is likely to beat the engine

be provided by means of a steam spray
extracting apparatus, as well as a steam
fan blast that will pump in an adequate
supply of pure air. In this way the
atmosphere of this gigantic sick-bay will be
constantly changed and purified, and thus
one of the greatest aids to nature for the
restoration of health be secured.
There is no questioning the fact with
even a sem bianco of truthfulness that the
percentage of recovery of injured men on
board an ambulance ship, properly
equipped, would be fully a half greater
than at present. Admitting that there
might be isolated cases of ships that
would find it possible to give the wounded
proper aid, the difference in the quarters
assigned to the injured, which are
known on board ship as the
sick-bay, and those of the ambul
ance ship is so great as to render com
ment unnecessary. In the first place, the
Bick-bay is always located in the bow of a
man-of-war, even though the medical de
partment of the navy has for years pro
tested against it. Owing to the hawse
holes, this is one of the parts of the ship
most likely to be flooded in heavy weather.
It is the one place in which the air porte
must be kept rigorously closed while the
vessel is at sea. Excepting that portion
of the ship which is in the immediate
vicinity of the engine-room, it is the
noisiest place on board a man-of-war.
When the anchor goes down or the
anchor-chains follow the engine in its
rounds, even the one exception noted in
point of noise can no longer be considered.
Any one who has ever crossed the
Atlantic Ocean knows that the bow of the
steamer is the one place where you are
pretty near sure to be seasick, because
the motion of the boat is so perceptible
there. The effect of the motion of the
ship at such a point upon persons who are
ill or suffering from injury is very delete
rious. Naval surgeons say it is impossible
for them to aid a wounded man or to treat
him proper y in the modern sick-bay.
Thus it is plain to any one that, leaving
aside the question of the necessity of im
mediate aid for injured men, the very
change oi quarters, or ratner, the caring
for the Wuunded in a proper part of the
ship, is of itself a tremendous argument in
favor of the ambulance ships.
A practical example of what aid without
delay will accomplish was shown last
Anril at the time the Old Dominion steam
ship Wyanoke, which runs between New
port News and New York, coiltded with
ti.e man-of-war Columbia, near Newport
New?. A number of persons who were
injured by the collision were almost im
mediately picked up by the cruiser's boats
and taken aboard the Columbia for treat
ment. Their cases were quickly diagnosed |
as partial drowning, burns, scalds, contu
sions, shock, chills and prostration. There
to a fire by about half time. There never
was a team of fire horses, fast as they co,
ttat could get an apparatus to a fire in as
short a space of time as it can. be moved
there when it derives motive power from
the bicycle. There is small danger of ac
cident, except to the leader or pilot, and
he can scorch to his heart's content with
out danger of molestation by persons in
blue coats and brass buttons.
The one factor of the fire department
which proba-bly finds a greater sphere of
usefulness than any other is that enemy of
flame which looks not a little like a water
cooler, but is in reality a chemical fire
extinguisher. The extinguisher is fast
ened between two wheels of what looks
more like a tricycle than anything else.
Eebind the extinguisher and its wheels in
a bicycle that is part and parcel of the ex
tirguisher apparatusâ or rather it is only
part of a bicycle, (or it is the nind wheel
and the two front wheels which look so
like a tricycle, that form the major part of
this fire department bicycle.
For speed there has never been anything
like it seen in the tire department. In al
most any buildine of consequence these
days there are several fire extinguishers,
so the work of the chenrcal fife-extin
guisher connected with the fire depart
ment may not be considered of much im
portance. The extinguisher and the man
who runs it, however, are not unlike, in
was not the unnecessary delay of a moment
in caring for them, the riquisite supplies
were right at hand, and the result was
that every one of them completely re
covered.
The afflictions of these persons who
were picked up by the Columbia's boats
were exactly those which many of the
patiems of ambulance snips would suffer
from. The Wyanoke injured were treated
in the Columbia's sick-bay. The injured
on board an ambulance ship would be
free from the fetid air of the sick-bay, in
an atmosphere that was kept constantly
purified. Under these conditions then
how much greater would bi their chances
for recovery r The combination of imme
diate aid, plenty of room and pure air at
sea for the sick and injured would be so
powerful that the injured would often
laugh in death's face, where now they
cringe at his approach.
The duty of the officers and crew on an
ambulance ship would carry them into
dangerous places at all times. Still it is
believed by naval medical authorities that
rarely would it occur that either the am
bulance suip or her men would find them
selves in danger of destruction and
death. The agents of the Red Cross So
ciety in theis recent mission in TurKey
encountered about the same percentage of
danger that would fall to the lot of the
ambulance ship and her crew.
Of course it would be absolutely impos
sible for an ambulance ship to care for all
the wounded during an engagement un
less that engagement were simply between
two vessels. The truth of tnis statement
is j-howo by th,e fact that the ordinary
battle-ship, whose complement is fully 500
men, will have, within a few mir.utes of
the time action begins, 30 men killed and
120 wounded. This is not a theory, but a
careful calculation from facts that have
been collected by officers of the navies of
the world. For instance, in a conflict be
tween the Chinese and Japanese fleets
that took place off the Yalu Riv?r Sep
tember 14, 1894, one shell that was fired at
long range from the Chinese ship Tsi
Yuen, killed 7 men and wounded more
than 50 on board the Japanese flagship.
Every shell that is rired does not, nat
urally, create the same havoc on board
ship as in the instances quoted. But, in
these days of modern gunnery, it is fair
to assume that at least a third of the pro
jectiles aimed by one warship at another
do some execution. Thi-Â» is considering
bfx shells alone. Add to their work the ' ]
death that would be spread abroad by the
rapiJ-hre guns and it can be seen that the j
ambulance ship would have plenty to do ;
Â«f it only attended to thf complement of ]
one cruiser.
A difficulty that has been carefully con- j
sidered lies in the removal of the wounded I
from the cruUers' decks to those of the i
the public mind, to the situation to which
the man from Texas referred when he
gave utterance to the famous truism con
cerning firearms.
Then there is the hook and ladder. This
is the most drfficult apparatus of ail the
fire department to move. It is always
very lon- and very unwieldy, hard to
manage aqd invariably a iittle'late tn get
ting where it is wanted. To make a quick
turn with a hook and . ladder even though
the best tillerman in the woriJ was at the
wheel is a task which no one who knows
cures to attempt.
It would seem, therefore, that a decided
difficulty confronted the two wheelmen
who ride at the head of the bicycle hook
and ladder apparatus. A number of runs
have been made, however, and not only
has the apparatus steered well, but com
petent judges who had the opportunity to
witness the new contrivance's perform
ance deciare that the prejudice against
the bicycle hook and ladder truck is alto
gether unfounded.
While it is absolutely necessary, of
course, for firemen and apparatus to reach
the scene of the outbreak of flame in the
trading district, or that section of the city
where the retail stores mostly congregate,
in the shortest possible time it is often
even more important that the fire patrol
should be first on hand. This is better
known as the insuranca patrol, and the
duties of the members consist of covering
with tarpaulins all the goods which are
insured in the building where the fire has
broken out.
These duties make it advisable for the
insurance patrol to reach a burning build
ing in advance of the firemen, if possible,
in order that they may perform at least
a portion of their task before streams of
water begin to play upon the biaze. The
upper right hand corner of the accom
panying illustration shows how the up-to
date insurance patrol will journey to a fire.
It will be observed that each man has a
large roll of tarpaulin tightly secured to
the bicyle. It is so fastened, however
that it can be detached at a second's
notice and is. in reality, in much better
shape to hundie than the tarpaulins as
they lie in the patrol wagon now in gen
eral use.
There bas been for many year? the
strongest rivalry between fire companies'
particularly those of volunteer depart
ments, as to which should first reach the
scene of conflagration. The bicycle will
add to rather t:.an lessen this spirit of
rivalry, for it will now be the beet rider
instead of the best runner, who is cham
pion. There seems to be no doubt that
this, one of the strongest efforts to mate
the bicycle a vehicle for practical use as
well as pleasure, will meet with decided
success.

THE ODDEST OF ALL CEMETERIES.
/\r\ Eastern Horse Grar\k Starts a pViVate Equirxe
Burial Qrourxd.
There is a man in Massachusetts who
treats his horses with the >auie consider
ation tney would receive if they were hu
man being?. In life they receive the best
of care, and in death they are buried in a
private cemetery. This cemetery pos
sesses the distinction of being the only one
of the kind in the wdrid. It ia the most
peculiar form that philanthropy has yet
taken. It promises to prove popular, how
ever, with thos; who have tbe interests of
the horse at heart and prefer to remember
him as beine placed* under ground rather
than as a roast, steak or sausage.
Benjamin F. Poole of Rockland, Mass.,"
is the man whose tender heart inspired
this unique idea. Neither is he satisfied
with the honor that devolves upon' the
horse in being buried like a person, for he
believes that to pay the proper respect to
its memory monuments should be erecteJ.
The picture herewith presented shows Mr.
Poole' s idea as it will look when carried
into effect.
When it is considered that it requires
genuine self-sacririce these days to give a
horse what might be termed Christian
burial, Mr. Poole will be viewed in the
light of an equine philanthropist.
Five of tLe horses which have been laid'
to rest in this oddest of cemeteries are,
Mr. Poole believes, worthy of special com
mendation. The first of these wÂ«.s a ilor
gan thoroughbred named Dick. He
could trot in 2:40.
Major, the second, was to the horse world
what an honest man is said to be to the
human sphere. Mr. Poole says of himt
"He was one of the most honest horses
ever owned by any one. Very few persons
ever passed me on the road when I was
driving him. He could trot in any har
ness a quarter of a mile at a 2:50 gait."
Kittie, a chestnut mare, ranks' No. 3 in
theiist. She, her owner says, was' a horse
of whom the ladies were fond. So kind
and gentle an animal, he believes, is en
titled to all the consideration after death
that this one received.
The fourth and fifth of the horses Mr.
Poole so greatly admired were Fannie and
Nellie, a pair of matched driving horse?.
Each weighed 975 pounds. Fannie died in
1896.
It might be aslcerl, how long did Mr.
Poole own these animals to which he gave
ssch tender care? These figures answer
the question : D:ck, 5 months; Major, 21
years old, 14 years; Kittie, 18 years old,
12 years; Fannie, 15 years old, 12 years;
Nellie, 16 years old. 15 yoÂ»rs.
By any one who carefully considers all
the facts told Mr. Poole's charity will be
appreciated. It is a fact that a dead horse
is often worth more than a living one, for j
these are the days when horse-meal, '
cleverly disguised, is no stranger to the
butcherâhop. Every horse that Mr. Poole
has bnne 1 in his cemetery represents a
net loss to him of $25 o $100. Regardless
of this fact. Mr. Pooie hopes before many
! nionibs to be able to mark the resting
place of each animal in an appropriate and
artistic manner.
The designs for the horse monuments
are varied in the extreme. Of course the
equestrian statue is ti;e one WiAcfa is gen
erally favored. There are, however, a
number of designs which show that cuie
fill thought has been given the subject.
For instance, one design represents a
horse in an attitude of slumber in his stall,
from the ambulance ship which lies along
side.
This action can be performed, unas
sisted, by two men, so-far as transporting
the injured tfian from the place where he
falls to the boat's cretv is concerned. It
'can.nlao be accomplished very expedi-
I tious'y. Any one who has ever seen the.
sailors of a man-of-war ,go aboard by I
means of a whip or spar ringed over the '
carefully blanketed, while along one side
of the blanker, in letters of marble, are the
words, "Requiescat in pace." Another is
in bas-relief upon a bloik of marble. It
represents the open door of a comfortable
looking barn, and just inside the door,
held by an invisible hand, is seen a meas
ure of oafs. Outside, what is supposedly
snow seems to be falling. Just about en
tering the barn is an old and decrepit
horse. Underneath the design are the
words, "Horce at Last."
Perhaps the most unique design of all â
and this is also in bas-relief â is that of a
gigantic sheaf of oats. Each separate oat
is shown with wonderful clearness. 'On
eacn side of the sheaf is an inscription.
One inscription is: "This variety of oats
ONLY HORSE CEMETERY IN THE WORLD.
is what the horse receives after he dies."
The second inscription reads, "What may
be looked for in the horse heaven." â¢
One designer has evidently been in
spired by what be has read of the Indian
idea of the hereafter. His plan embraces
both a statue and a bas-relief. The statue,
which is at the summit of a pedestal sur
mounting a square block of granite, is
that of a horse rearing. On the granite
block in bold relief is this scene: A
meadow or fiela with the grass growing
freely. Ou the outside of the fence which
surrounds the field stands an aged horse
with his bead over the top rail, gazing at
the luxuriant pasturage, with feeble imi
tation of the look that jtfosej must have
given the Promised Land. Just the other
side of the fence and looking at the old
horse in a very coltish manner is what
appears to be a very young horse, to
whom life has no sorrows whatever. Un
derneath the picture are these words,
"What death accomplishes for the horse. "
Another design, onv of those shown in
the accompanying illustration, is of the
equestrian statue order, and repre
sents a dock-tailed horse with the
left foreleg raised as if impatiently
waiting for the signal to be oS and away.
side can easily understand the modus
operandi of transferring the wounded.
The necessity of the ambulance ship ia
being strenuously urged by Surgeon-Gen
eral Tryon and the Secretary of the Navy.
It is the present intention to secure an
appropriation therefor at the next session
of Congress. The accompanying illustra
tion gives an excellent idea of the naval
ambulance and what it can accomplish.
This statue surmounts an oblong block of
marble. On the side of this block is a
figure of a horse apparently in active mo
tion. Above and beneath it are these
words: "Man's noblest friend. His race
is run.' r
A favorite idea of the designer seems to
be that emblem so often chosen for funeral
purposes, the horseshoe. One clever ar
tist has placed a giant horseshoe on a
pedestal. iJpon the pedestal's side he has
drawn the cap of a jockey encircled by the
variety of whip that all horsemen know so
well. Another idea is an ordinary slab of
marble on which Is cut a horse-collar,
broken, With the name and age of the
# horse underneath.
In all the plans for the benefit of the
horse which the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals has conceived none
have contained evidence' of the slightest
â consideration for the animal after death.
This, therefore, is aji entirely new de
parture. The idea of a private cemetery
for horses stands alone. So iar as known
there is only <rae man who has ideas ap
proaching those of Mr. Poole. While he .
has" no private cemetery for horse 3, when
a horse that served him faithfully for
many years died he had a casket made for '
it, covered the casket with black broad
cloth, placed silver handles thereon and
to the cover attached the customary Dlate,
with the name and age of the deceased
anirua'. He placed the equine remains
in a grave and erected a lencp around
it. This happened at Penobscot, Maine.
Mr. Poolt'a ideas are certainly lareelv in
advance of those of his fellows. He says
they are due. to the fact that he sees no
reason why a horse is not entitled to re
spect after death in proportion to its in
telligence and faithfulness. "It is my â 
own idea, I believe," he said to the writer.

BY FRANCES I.APLACE (13^ YEARS).
. One bright June day Willies aunt
Mary took lunch with his mother. When
it was time for her to leave, as she kissed
,the little boy good-by, she slipped a bright
silver dollar into one of his rosy hands.
Oh, how happy he was, and how big that
dollar looked!
Willie spent a great deal of time in
thinking of the loveiv things he could buy
with it, and loved to take it out of his
pocket and look at it many times a day.
One afternoon as he was running zayly
down the street, his beloved dollar tightly
clasped in one iittie band, he met an old
organ-grinder, and cauering around on
the top of the organ was the cutest, tiniest
monkey he had ever seen.
Willie stopped and stared, with mouth
wiiie open, at the man and his monkey.
'ol>, if I might buy that monkey with
my dollar, how happy I should be!"
thought the boy. So he plucked tip his
courage and timidly asked, "Please, Mister
Organ-grinder, will you sell me that little
monfeey ?"
"How mucha mona you giva for da
monk?" answered the Italian.
Now before we go on with the story 1
must tell you that the man was very
wicked and cunning. He knew that no
rnattfr how much money might be given
him for his monkey the animal was so
vicious and mischievous that no one
could possibly keep it but himself, and by
hanging around the premises of its pur
chasers he would sooa recover possession
oi his monkey again.
So when Willie, holding up his precious
dollar, said "This much," the Italian
answered:
''Taka da inonka, boy. I sella hima
vera cheapa. Hima no bita; vera gooda
monk."
Tha bargain being settled Willie started
for Jiome, clasping his purchase tight in
his arms, while the organ-grinder slyly
watched him until he entered his father's
grounds.
"I soona geta monk back; plenta mona
buy good vino," he muttered as he
walked away.
WILLIES BAD BARGAIN.
CHILDHOOD'S
REALM
When Willie rushed into the house and
showed the monkey to his mother she de
clared she would not have it about. The
poor little boy begged so hard to be al
lowed to keep it that she finally con
sented on condition that he keep it in
the woodshed.
So Mr. Monkey was taken to his new
quarters; but, alas! Willie forgot to shut
the door.
Supper time came and Willie bad not
yet dared to tell his father how he had
spent his dollar, but his papa Â»oon found
out without his little son's telling him
anything nb<">ut it.
When the family were all seated around
the table piercing screams were suddenly
heard issuing from the yard. Willies
father rushed out and found Bridget, al
most frightened to death, with a dark ob
ject on her shoulder and two wicked little
hands tugging fiercely at her hair.
"Ow! ow! Oh J take it away! Shure
an 1 it's a monkey. Och! be quick and take
it away !" screamed th c poor girl.
"YOU GOT AWAY FROM THANKSGIVING, OLD FELLOW, BUT CHRISTMAS'LL GET YOU."
Mr. Page dragged it from her shoulder
and exclaimed, "W r hy, Bridget, whose
monkey is it, and how did it get here?"
"Shure it's meself that don't know,"
she answered.
So they hurried into the house, Mr.
Page holding the monkey by the back
of the neck, much to its discomfort, to try
and solve the mystery.
When Willie saw his pet being so
roughly handled he cried, "Oh! papa,
you're hurting my dear little monkey."
Then of course the secret was out.
"Your monkey !" exclaimed his father
in'surprise. "Where did you get a mon
key? '
"Why, papa, I bought him with my
silver dollar from an old organ-grinder."
"Well, my boy, you may take him back
to the cr. an-crinder to-morrow, for we
cannot be bothered with such a nuisance."
"Oh, papa, please, please, let me keep
him. I can teach him to be gentle, I'm
sure I can," begged Willie, while the tears
streamed down his face.
"Well, I'll think about it and decide to
morrow," said Mr. Page, "but he must be
secured in the woodshed for the night.'*
So out to the woodshed the animal went

once more, but not to pass the night there.
Willie went to sleep wondering if his
father would consent to allow him to keep
his new pet.
About midnight Mrs. Page awoke her
husband, saying, "John, John, wake up,
quick! Don't you hear that noise in the
pantry?"
They both listened for a second, and
then a loud crash, like that which follows
the breaking of crockery, greeted their
ears.
Jumping from bed Mr. Page cautiously
hurried toward the pantry, takinsr the
stovepoker in his hand as a weapon of de
fense against a possible burglar.
When he opened the door all was dark
and silent within, but as be struck a
match to light the gas something sprang
upon his shoulder and then jumped, chat
tering, to the floor. Of course, it was the
monkey.
The door of the woodshed had been in
securely fastened and had been blown
open by the wind.
Attracted by the savory odors of the
pantry the monkey soon tore a hole in the
mosquito netting which covered the open
window and gained an entrance. As he
clambered over the shelves of course
everything movable was thrown down,
and pies, cakes, butter and eggs swam in
the milk which flooded the floor.
Mr. Page called his wife and Bridget to
see the condition of their pantry and to
help him catch the cause of the trouble,
who had disappeared.
Just as they had finished searching
through the rooms downstairs they were
startled by terrified yells from Willie.
"Quick! Quick!" said Mrs. Pajte, "the
monkey must be in his room," as she
dashed up the stairs, followed by her hus
band and Bridget.
Mr. Page hastily lighted the gaÂ«, while
his wife flew to her boy, and Bridget
stood la the door flourishing the broom.
The light disclosed poor Willie sitting
up in bed, the monkey perched on his
shoulder, puMing his hair with one band
and scratching the dear little face with
the otner.
Mr. Page was so anery at this sight that
'be grasped the animal by the neck and,
opening the window, flung him into the
street, not without receiving a few bites
and scratches in the scuffle.
It was quke a while before all the dam
age done that night was repaired, and
Willie bore the marks of the monkey's
claws for some time.
One day, about a month after this, Wil
lie again met the organ-grinder and, much
to his surprise, he had with him the same
wicked little monkey.
The man knew him, and said, with s
grin: "Don't you lika buya monk to-day?
I sella vella chcapa. Good monk â no
bita."
But Willie walked away without paying
any attention to the two well-mated com
panions, and I'm. sure alter his woeful ex
perience he always asks the advice of his
mother or father before he spends h:s sil
ver dollars.

It was Kit's birthday!
A joyful time, indeed; and there was a
kisi and a speech and a little present for
her from everybody.
But when Kit saw grandpa- coming her
face fell, for he- bad his hands behind
him. Had he brought her no gift? Grand
pa kissed her five times for her five years
and then his hands came in sight, and in
them was a long, slim roil of paper.
"You are getting so old, little Kit," he
said, "that I have brought you a cane! "
Oh, how Kit felt! What did she want
with a > ane!
JJiu as she was a polite little girl she
took it, kissed him and said "Thank you,
grandpa."
The cane was rolled in several sheets of
silky paper and prettily tied with pink
ribbons.
Kit took the papers off one by one, and
when the very Jast one was removed she
gave a little scream of delight, "Oh, oh,
oh!" It was a cane, to be sure, but a
candy cane. A cane made of candy, a
yard long, payly striped in red and white.
"Hurrah for you, grandpa!'' cried Kit,
as she gave him a hearty kiss and then
danced merrily away to show her new
treasure to her own dear mother.

Four hungry-looking animals
All seated in a row;
Why does not some one speak to them?
Thai's what I want to know.
They all of them were bidden to
A fine Thanksgiving feast,
And now, it seems to me, their host
Might welcome them, at least.
'Twas Master Fug invited themâ
Why does he not appear?
'Tis plain they thini his absence looks
Extremely rude and queer.
Alas! poor Pug's ia trouble sore,
The host he cannot play;
No feast for self or friends has he
On this Thanksgiving day.
He saw a turkey, large and fat,
Upon the kitchen shelf;
"That's just the very thing I want,"
Said he unto himself.
He caught the turkey, but the cook
Caught him with firmer grasp,
And shook him till he coula not bnrk,
But only choke and gasp.
Meanwhile, those hungry animals,
Who'd waited there in vain,
Declared they never would be guests
Of Mr. Pujr again.

Out West, last spring, two young men
were plowing when they found two young
coyotes, a species of prairie-dog. They
tried to take the coyotes home. Afteragood
deal of trouble with the father and mother,
who tried to recover their dear babies
from these, to them, cruel monsters, the
men succeeded in driving the father ana
mother away, and then tied the babies se
curely in a bag. They watched the bag
for a while, but, as the father and mother
did not attempt to come nearer than the
edt?e of the wood, they thought they were
thoroughly frightened and would not try
to get their babies back. The men fol
lowed the plow from* end to end of the
field, passing the little creatures in the
bug several times. Suddenly there was a
strange sight when they turned down the
field. It was the mother coyote dragging
the bag with her babies in it across the
field to the woods. She reached the woods
with the bag, escaping the men, and there
probably ripped the bag open and let her
babies out. She seemed to know that to
let them out of the bag in the field would
mean recapture; she could run with them
tied up faster than they could run if free.

Any boy who has been about a carpen
ter-shop, or has handled a saw and ham
mer himself, knows all about the different
kinds of nails â fourpenny, eightpenny,
tenpenny ana so onâ and perhaps he has
sometimes wondered vhy the different
sizes are known as "pennies."
Originally, an eightpenny nail, for ex
ample, was called "eight-ponnd" nail, be
cause a thousand nails of that particular
size weiehert eight pounds. Carpenters
were not particolar about pronouncing tho
names very clearly, and in a short time an
eight-pound nail was known as an "eight
pun" naii; from that it became changed to
"eight-pen"; and then somebody tuink
ing "pen" was a contraction for
"penny," changed it to "eightpenny," and
that's the way it has remained to this day.
It is somewhat curious that a poand
should have worked its way down to a
penny, and that when we say penny we
really mean pound.â St. Nicholas.

To-day I'm going to introduce all my
animal friends to you.
First, the three horses. These dear
friends of mine have a beautiful stable
painted bright red, and they are very
faithful servants to our master.
Belle, the carriage-horse, is a beautiful
black and has a long silky mane and tail.
Dirk and BeÃch, the others, are tne work
horses. Dick, who is black also, was the
carriage-horse before master bought Belle.
Beach is white and is a very hard worker;
and oh, he is such a noble fellow.
Then come the doesâ Sport and Fido.
Sport is a fat, brown dog, with curly hair,
and he has lived here ever and ever so
long. He frolics and is a pretty good sort
of a fellow, but awfully greedy.
He plays a funny trick on Fido and me
very often. He is so cunning about it
that he fools us every time. When we are
busily engaged eating our dinn*r,.all at
once he runs, barking with all his might,
down the driveway. Of course we follow
to see what's up. Then the sly fellow
runs back as quickly as he can and gob
bles up all of our dinner.
Fido is a little black and tan. He is a
tiny fellow and is very jealous of me.
Whenever he sees our little mistress play
ing with me he growl 3 and snarls with
anger, but he loves Sport very much and
seems perfectly nappy when our mistress
fondles that tig fat fellow.
A great many cats live here, but they
don't like the way I play, for the moment
they ste me coming they hunch up their
tacks, spit, and then turn around and
scamper up the trees, where they know I
can't go.
"Baby" is the large house pussy. He is
a great pet and puts on very high and
mighty airs. He won't deign to eat with
the rest of the pets, but has his meals
served on a white plate in the dining
room. I'm never allowed to eet any
place near him, for he is so afraid of me.
I think that's too bad, don't you? I'd
just like to get close enough to admire
his beauty, ana then I think it would be
great iun to make him run real fast, just
once.
The queerest and most comical pets on
the place are the two owls. They are
what my mistress calls "monkey-faced
owls," and are quite large, having beauti
ful plumage, sharp curved bills and bright
shiny eyes. They make a terr:ble noise
all night. They sit and squeal and saueal
like figbing monkeys, until my ears
fairly ring. Their favorite food is on
cooked birds and they have ravenous ap
petites. When mv master is helping them
a second time at a meal they snap at his
tinners and act as if they would like to
bite him. A very impolite thing for any
pet to ao, don't you tnink so?
Now, with three barks, which mean
three cheers, for our new President, I re
main your friend, Rex.

An absent-minded old gentleman went
into a shop to buy a new cane.
"Thai's a very nice one," he said, pick

i is that?"
"That's the one you brought in with
you. Yon just laid it down there, eir,"
said the shopkeeper.
"Oh, really?" said the old gentleman.
"Then I don't need a new one. Good
day." And he walked out.

Having reflected upon female athletics
in general in my last letter and considered
the po'ssibHities of female development in
particular, we "will turn our attention
to specific forms of exercise. Now therÂ«
are different degrees of gymnastics and
athletics, as there are grades in a school
or v university, only they have not been
dictated by competent authority. There
are no faculties or boards to prescribe the
courses and the curriculum. It might be a
eood thing if there were; however, we
must get along without them as best we
may.
Let-Os see how a young girl or a lp.dy not
at all strong should begin. Let me warn J
them in tiie most solemn manner that tbe
bueian constitution is of such peculiar
composition that it is possible to do a cer
tain act in defiance of nature a hundred
times with impunity, and then wrench
something that might send you to bed for
x year. In other words, do not be rash
Dfecause some one else is rash. Be con
tent to go ?bout your exercise gradually
and patiently. Avoid ceing hasty.
A woman is a strange piece of ma
chinery/ "Women are queer cattle," a
friend once remarked to me, and I guess
he was aboat right. Lei a young man not
particularly strong enter a gymnasium or

strange and unusual thing if tie strains or
over-exerts himself; but let a girl who is
sadly in need of exercise engage in the
GOOD, HEALTHFUL EXERCISE.
game pursuits and ahe must be careful or
â  something micht give away. Therefore,
let me prescribe a rule which, if iived up
to, will keep you out of danger: Never
exert your muscles until they strain;
never exert your legs until you feel ex
haustion creep over you ; never try to do a
little more when you already feel fa
tigued.
Rudimentary exercise can be taken in
diffeient forms. Skipping rope, the
wands, good walks, light dumbbells, run
ningj bicycling â in fact, many such pur
suits can be indulged in, provided care is
used. Mest women and some men never
show their ignorance and lack of sense
quite as much as those parents who refuse
. to permit their child to continue exercis
ing because by some accident, careless
ness or ignorance the beginner has been
somewhat injured. I hops I have more
reason than to Insist that a child who has
a poor instructor, or who displays a want
of ability to take care of himself or her
â  self, shouid continue as before at the risk
and likelihood of still greater injuries. If
a toddling baby slips and falls while cross
ing the floot for the first time, bumping
his nose severely, must the little one be
confined in' his cradle all his life?
If circumstances are unfavorable to
your "taking exercise in a gymnasium
under a proper instructor much can bo
' accomplished at home. We will suppose
1 that you have a room suitable for the pur
pose â a garret, a store-room, a dry cellar
or an out-libuse. Almost any place will
do provided it is roomy, without gas
fixtures or pojsts to bother you, or likeli
' 4iood of annoying other people by your
' hopping arÂ»und.
If you have a suit of bloomers, so much
the better; if not, remove all the clothing
you can without catching cold, and have
your 'muscles and limbs free and un
trammeled. You can now take a wand,
and by the examples set forth in a book
that you cam procure for the purpose, gain
considerable flexibility and grace, and
some strength thereby. Light dumb
bells can also be used, working the limbs
in every conceivable direction, aiming to
bring "into day every possiole muscle.
Then try the skipping rope for a change.
If you like indian clubs, I would advise
that you not only u^e them but aim to be
proficient asÂ° possible. There is little or
.no danger of overdoing this particular
exercise unless it is kept uptoo long; and
it is graceful, invigorating and fascinating
to some. Â°A young lady who would become
an artist at this branch of gymnastics
would be a star attraction at stage enter
tainments. These implements are to be
recommended as an excellent form of
exercise. They bring about. every, muscle
into play with little if any danger to be
feared by the most timid. As one becomes
accustomed to their use, they can be sub
aiitutvl by heavier ones, or if they are of
irttle monetary value, they can be bored
around, the circumference and at the ba^e,
and the holes tilled with lead. Indian
"cub's give strength and grace to the one
who uses them with perseverance.
While in the rudimentary stace a little
running can be indul .-cd in provided care
in used. For example, take a walk to the
sea beach; then take a run on the sands,
but do out run over 100 feet at firs', and
even men do not stiain yourself. When
you fee! an inclination to stop, do bo at
once, remembering that you are not
stronp-, and any severe ex rtion might do
more harm tban good. Bear in mind that
yon cannot run as you could wnen a girl;
not because yon are out of practice, but
for the reason that your physique has un
dergone a change since your girlhood.
Ttie nature o' this change is not in my
province to describe, as it comes under
the head of a medical discourse. Suffi
cient to say that the bones of the pelvis
have been transformed to an extent that
robs a woman of t c ability and speed
that she formerly possessed. This should
not prevent your running for pleasure and
exercise; and no possible harm can result
if prbper care is used and thought given to
the particular needs and weaknesses of
your own system.
Another step that can be taken is bi
cycling. A woman would indeed be very
weak if she couid not taue a short turn on
the wheel every day, riding up and down
a smooth thoroughfare a few times. The
exertion is commonplace, and as the lim
itation can be a foaif dozen blocks each
way there is little danger of injury. Long
trips should be avoided until the fair aih
lete is sure she is strong enough to bear
the effort with impunity.
If you have the opportunity rowing is
an excellent form of exercise, provided
you do not row such a distance from the
shore that you i.TO'v tired and then turn
back. You will then have to return an
equal distance and may reach the shore ex
hausted. Otherwise rowing is a most
healthful form of exercise.
Under proper restrictions there is no
more healtniul form of sport than swim
ming. For one who is not strong care
should be taken that the water is not too
cold. The human constitution is exceed
ingly pesuliar about such matters, for I
have known an instance where a young
man who had not entirely recovered from
a sieÂ«e of typhoid fever could plunge into
an ice-cold bath, while a champion athlete
stood on. the Brink unwilling to do tie
same, well knowing that it would chill
him to the bone and reduce his tempera
ture to a degree that would be unhealthful.
A person's build, temperament and habit
have a great deal tQ do with auch mat
ters, and I say unhesitatingly if persons
s,hrink from the plunge, let them have
their own way.
Salt, water is very invigorating, to say
nothing of the salt a*ir, the run on the
beacb untrammeled by a cloud of skirts,
and ihe exertion of the muscles of the
arms and legs while swimming, or even
attempting to swim. It is a well-known
fact that one must be exceedingly careful
about catching cold if bathing in fresh
water, liut it is a rare thing to be troubled
that way after a Sijlt bath.
In my next letter we will discuss a more
advanced routine for those who are some

have been speaking to, of who have at

precepts. George D. Baird.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1896,
AN AIRSHIP INVENTED BY A WEEL-KNOWN GERMAN AERONAUT
jF^fj HOVKL airship has recently been exhibited in the pleasure park of the Berlin Exposition, says the New York Herald. It is the work of
Km â¢ Dr. Wolfert, the well-Kuown aeronaut, who for years has been trying to solve the problem of aerial navigation. This problem he now
J|jX*i7 claims to have solved with his new airship Deutschland, an illustration of which accompanies this articl:-, and to those who have seen
him Bpeed through the air in Deutschland his claim seems to be well founded. The great difficulty hitherto has been to manufacture
airships that could be steered in any direction; this difficult feat Dr. Wolfert claims to have accomplished. The question now is, Can he also
succeed in steering his airship through a *torm and at any height from the ground ? As five days and nights were occupied in filling the
balloon (at the doctor's factory In Lehoneberg this task could have been accomplished in an hour) much of the power was lost and the vessel,
which itself weighs 700 kilogrammes, was not In a condition to carry Dr. Wolfert, who weighs 100 k:logiammÂ«s, the result being that G.
Wirsum of Cannstatt ascended in his stead and made the experiments. The nirship is 28 meters in length and B,'jj meters in dinmeter in the
middle and it la propelled by a ship's Daddle, with two blades, which hns a diameter of 2 5-10 meters. There is a second paddle under the
gondola, which is used alike for the purpose of ascending an J descending. These paddies make about 500 revolutions to the minute. The
gondola, which is 4 meters long and made of bamboo, is firmly fastened to the balloon. How it is fastened is a secret which Dr. Wolfert keeps
careiullv to himself. He intends to make another ascent in the near future and he then hopes to be able to prove the practical utility of his
new airship.
AN IDYL OF THE AUTUMN TIME
Oli^e Hevjdens Poetic Picture of the Season of Bright
Tints in Northern California
I wonder if some of those who come
from the Eastern States do not miss in
the balmy sunshine of Central and South
ern California the crisp beauty of a frosty
autumn. No wonder the softest and
sweetest words of the language have been
used to faintly describe tnis loveliest sea
son of the year. It is Indian summer,
indeed; the crown of the year, the time
when the lotus-eaters might feel at Dome,
thÂ« season of dreamy lights, bright tints
and smoky distances. â¢
But autumn is not her real relf unless
the leaves turn, unless there is snow in
the far distance, unless the air of early
morning sparkles with dry celd. Does the
Easterner long for this even in the midÂ«t
of roses and under a cioudless sky? Let
him board the Oregon express and ride
just one night northward. He will awaken
in the midst of the glorious autumn of
Northern California.
The distances which In summer were
blue are now purple exquisitely shaded
from lavender to almost black. The
nearer mountains rise tall and .seemingly
more steep than before, because the un
dergrowth has cast the leaf and the brown
earth s ows through. Tbe pines stana
here and there like green-coated sentinels
whose uniform cannot change, but tbe
other forest people have put on the new
fall styles. They have perfect taste, the
fashionable foresters, and combine colors
in a way that would drive a French milli
ner wild with envy. Watch an oak tree
to see bow, from pale yellow, the shades
run up the scale to deep brown without
ever striking a false note, and for witching
combinations of pink and red sit down
and gaze at a maple.
There is one picture I go to see every
autumn, and I would paint it, if I Could,
and mate mv name immortal. Nature
paints it for me every year anew, but she
draws her bru-h filled with dull brown
over the canvas when winter comes. It is
two trees, an oak and a maple, side by
side, and around both, like a tie of love
binding two lives, there twined a wild
grapevine, spreading around and up nearly
as high as they.
In tbe summer time the vine shows lit
tle, but when the frost comes, like love in
adversity, the vine glows a cord of deepest
ciimson. There is nothing more lovely
than a' frost-kissed wild grape. It turns
one warm red, red as dark blood, from root
to tendril. The oak is yellow and brown,
with touches of pipk, and here and there
a spot of blood. The maple's balf-drooped
leaves glow blushing; pink, deep red and
rich wine color. Standing so close, these
trees have mingled their branche* until
tbe mixture of colors is like one of Keith's

beautiful pictures, and then, with that
deep, rich red vine weaving in and out
and up, the effect is magnificent.
A low hillside covered with scrub oak
and manzamta h&a been a joy to look at
for two months. T c manzaniti keeps
its rather pale green and the oaks have
outdone themselves in effects of yellow.
Yellow and brown conibwm with anything.
Against the earth color of the hill or
against the green of the manzanita the
oak leaves seem just tbe proper thine;
and against the purple of a more distant
bill the same brown-yellow seems as
beautiful. Against gray sagebrush an
o.ik looks iike a cameo, and even against
the gold of a sunset sky they are in per
fect harmony.
The lighter trees, the poplar and the
cottonwood, are leafless now. In early
autumn they turned to gold â their stand
ard â and then one morning, when the
oaks and maples smiled brighter tban
ever, their mass of gold lay gray and sad
at the foot of the nafced tree, and the rude
wind tore them and scattered them afar.
From my window I can see a barren,
rocky hill, whose naked sides grow soft
and lovely in the magic air. In tbe re
lentless summer light I couid see the bare
rocks anil tbe scarred ravine, but now it is
one purple hillside, except when sunset
turns it an indescribable color as of pur
ple dashed with pink. On that hillside ol
mine there is one tree. All summer I
guessed what kind, but could not be sure
while the leaves were green. In the first
autumn days I thought it might be a cot
tonwood, so yellow it turned, but now,
wbile the pop ars point their bare
branches to heaven, my solitary tree is
yellow still, growing each week a shade
darker. It is an oak â I know nowâ the
most lovely one in view, because it stands
alone on tbat purple steep.
I watch it grow darker, I watch the
nearer hills grow duller, and I know how
soon the beautiful leaves will lie on the
cold earth. I watch tbe snow, which all
summer lay on Shasta's crown, creeping
slowly, surely, "silently down â covering
the tops of the high mountains, then the r
lower slopes, then the higher foothills, â
creepinc iike a foamy tide each night a
little nearer. And soon, very soon, the
suow will lie cold and white in the valiey
and autumn will be winter.
Does it seem sad? Not so. Autumn is
the season of promise. Never except then
do the forÂ«st trees openly flaunt tbeir
beauty; never except thÂ«>n does the sun
go down in sucn a blaze of level golden
rays and leave such a glow after; never
except then is the magic air so full of re
pose, never, the mind so ready to hope, to
begin again.
The tites are not sad. See how they re
joice before they drop their robes and
begin their season of rest. Tfiey know
without doub'.in: â oh, wiser than we â
that after tue winter of death comes
another, life in spring, and yet another,
Without end.
Go to tha "forest for a lesson in faith, in
duty well done, in death without annihila
tion ; breathe the air of an autumn day for
strength, for resignation and for trust,
and watch an autumn sunset to see how
each time the sun of life should set.

went on, with even greater majasty and

A QUESTION OF EYES
HoW Defective Vision Among Chil
dren May Be Remedied
JMeW ScKoolbook Types and Half-Jone
Illustrations Tend to Strain EVen
Well-Developed Eyes
During an hour spent the other day on
tbe Children's Playground in Golden Gate
Park 1 noticed a dozen or more children
wearing spectacles.
By spectacles I do not mean the blue or
dark-colored glhsses that our merciless
elareofdrab sidewalk?, drab houses and
tretle>s streets render necessary, but spec
tacles worn with an air of requiring them
as a remedy for visual defecis. There
were tcis of five and six solemnly survey
ing the world through concavo-convex
lenses, and older youngsters watching
tbeir playmates through big, round gog
gles. The sight of two spectacled lads in
rapt enjoyment of the merry-go-round's
giddy whirl would have been funny had it
not been pathetic, and l might have smiled
over the girl of twelve who checked her
donkey in its mad career across the lawn,
the tetter to adjust her pince-lvz, had I
not felt a little justifiable wrath at the
stupidity that allowed her to wear such a
thing. If the vanity of spectacle-needing
grown-ups leads them to wear these sight
destroying contrivances, why, the conse
quences be on the head and the eyes, as
the Moslems say, but tbe children should
be better protected. It is only by careful
taking thought that an adult can keep
eyeglasses so adjusted as to look evenly
through each lens; a child cannot do it.
In the excitement of play they will shift; ;
they get bent; the undeveloped nose does j
not afford them sufficient support, and, I

more often than not, the wearer looks
through the center of one lens and the
rim of the other. The inevitable result is
a difference in the focus of the eyes, un
equal development and much mischief,
productive of after suffering. Such in
equality in the eyes may even be pro
ductive of serious brain trouble.
It is rather astonishing when we come
to think about it how prevalent defective
vision is among the children of this gen
eration. Physiologists used to tell us that
no child' is born near-sichted. Ido not
know whether this condition of things is
altered, but it is a fact that near-sighted
ness among small children is becoming
painfully common.
It would seem (judeing from a good
many of our educational methods) as
though it is a part of our sense of the fit
ness of things that this should be so. Cer
tainly we exercise considerable ingenuity
in devising contrivances to bring about
the re.sult. My personal recollection runs
not back to the time when those versed in
the science of caring for the eyes did not
tell us that a flat-topped desk is particu
larly bad for youthlul, or, for that matter,
for adult eyes. A child sitting writing or
reading at a flat desk bends forward his
head in order to bringfthe rage within the
range of vision. As a consequence the
eyeball, which is susceptible of slight
changes in shape, becomes more convex
under the influence of gravitation. In
the course of a few months of this bend
ing over of the head tbe convexity be
comes permanent, and the result is near
sightedness. A very slight slant in the
surface of desk or table does away with
the necessity for this bending of the head,
but in a large and popular schoolroom re
cently I saw tiny children and half-grown
pupils silting industriously bent forward
working at perfectly flat tables. Here, too,
as a matter of course, I observed the om
nipresent spectacles.
About as mischievous an employment
as has been devised to destroy the eyes of
children is the pricking work at which
they are busied in our kindergartens. I
was looking at a collection of this work
only a day or two ago â birds, ba-kets,
trees, flowers and a varied assortment of
figures laboriously pricked by tiny, eager
fingers in colored paper and cardboard.
The designs were complicated and minute.
The infinitesimal perforations were close
together and made with a regularity ttiat
would have tried older eyes and steadier
nerves to accomplish. Such work is par
ticularly bad for young, growing eyes.
"My Lord knoweth that the children are
tender," runs the old Oriental saying, but
with all our boasted nineteenth century
humanities we do not seem to have come
to an understanding of childhood's
physical limitations.
Too much â I had almost written any â
microscopical work is bad for very young
eyes, particularly if the instruments used
are, as is generally the case, adapted for
using but one eye at a time; yet the
microscopical work done In some of our
schools is of an amazing sort. Biology is
a study for infants nowadays. I came
across some rpapers in biology the other
day that an eight-year-old child had pre
pared. They were full of long words, of
which my own comprehension was the
vaguest, and contained some queer little
drawings of germ-cells in the course of
propagation. At least, this is how my
memory serves me. How much of it all
was really within the child's compre
hension may be inferred from the fact
that, being asked the nature of the proio
p'asm concerning which she was dis
coursing so glibly, sne replied, unhesi
tatingly. "'Why, protoplasm'is a bug."
B.ackboards and arec:ioital sight
destroyers. It is possible, by the aid of
colored crayons, to avoid a good deal of
the evil' attendant upon the uÂ«e of the
first-named, but the slate and pencil in
common- use are without a redeeming
feature. One of these days, when we are
wise, we shall pive our little children tab
lets of thick ground glass and sott black
lendpencils to use in their first attempts
at writing. We are already learning not
to let thtm print their early lessons. It
used to be thought that the babies, must
learn to print (a laborious, eye, brain and
hand-troubling process) before tney could
be trusted to write. Nowadays they are
taught to write at once with satisfactory
results. We are also coming to see tbe
folly of slanting letters, hair Hnes and
shading in penmanship, anJ the introduc
tion of the vertical writing in our schools
will doubtless prove a great saving to
youthful sight, but we shall never attain
to the best results until we have consigned
the school slate to limbo.
Little children are given entirely too
murh writing work at school. It seems
a pity that so much should be required to
satisfy the demands of modern education,
Tbe work of sight-deatroying which we
begin in tne infant classroom is faithfully
continued through adult life. A pessi
mistic philosopher has recently advanced
the theory that we are a less intelligent
and thoughtful race because of our hav
ing learned to read and write. Unques
tionably this is the view of an extremist,
but there can be no question but that our
modern making of books, so far as the
mere mechanical results are concerned,
ia a bad thing for the eyes. No one can
compare a page of any ordinary modern
book with a page of an old black-letter
volume without perceiving how little wis
dom the centuries have brought us in this
regard. The honest black letter is easy
to read. The long S will puzzie the tyro
for a lew minutes, but once the eye has
learned to recognize it the pace is seen at
a glance. Those first-printed books were
the best in point of utility as weil as of
beauty, and our modern book-makers give
us nothing so beautiful. There were no
subtilities about those first movable types,
but the letters were beautiful in form,
and the eyes took tnem in at a glance.
This is not possible with our modern
types with their fine lines and contrasts
of light and darK.
Even our scnoolbooks offend seriously
in this regard. I have before me several
books designed for young children, yet
printed in types calculated to try an<J
strain strong* well-developed eyes. Now,
it should be borne in mind that children's
eyes are no more mature and strong than
are their bones and muscles. Books
printed for them should be adapted to the
requirements of their eyes, as well as to
the immaturity of their minds. They
should be printed in plain, black letters,
with no attempt at hair lines or decora
tion, and should be on unglaztul paper.
The introduction of the Ã¼biquitous half
tone illustrations into our schoolbooKs has
been a bad thing in many way*. They re
quire smooth, shiny paper, just the thing
on wnich books designed for growing eyes -
should not be printed.
Some of our more recent attempts at
bookmaking have aimed at improved de
signs in type faces. Notable are the efforts
in this direction of the books that have
come from William Morns' famous Kelm
scott Press. Some of these have been ad
mirable and worthy of imitation for their
clear, beautiful print. The Jansen type,
so popular among certain of the faddists
of the hour, is a hideous, irritating, eye
and nerve trying tbing; and the De Vinne
letter, in which the Century Magazine ia
now printed, is but little better. In fact,
we have notning Â«o beautiful as the old
Roman block letter, save a few books of
recent date printed in Romanesque letter,
to which certain Eastern and English en
thusiasts are seeking to â¢ ducate tbe pub
lic. Before we are quite blind we ought
to make some effort to go back in the
direction of tbe black-letter books, at least
in printing pages for tbe children.

THE STAGE
There were differences of opinion re
specting L* Loie's dancing (sic) at the
California Theater last week. I heard
several bins-e first-nighters sneeringly re
mark: "Same old show; Papinta did all
tha*, and she couid dance a little" ; and I
heard others use bad French in their fran
tic efforts to give vent to an admiration
which the language of this country was
inadequate to express. Word poems,
symphonies, glittering rainbows of a<ijec
tives, pyrotechnical displays of words
Were exploded by the ladies and
gentlemen of tbe press for "La"
J^oie's benefit. Pierre .Loti, tbe
.great word- painter in La Belle France,
*'Le" Pierre, the one and only syrnplnftiic
word-painter of the French Academy,
would have paused aghast at the word
poems lavished on "La" Loie and mur
mured, "I'm not in it."
There is a great deal in the indorsement
of Paris. What Paris says to-day every
one who aspires to be fashionable says to
morrow. "La" Loie was the first figurante
to introduce to Paris the dance with Notre
Dame stained-glass window effects, and
Paris took her oy the hand and made a
fad of her. They say t: at inventors never
reap the Denefit of ttieir inventions, but
"La" Loie is the exception that proves the
rule. Paris has indorsed her, she has
adopted the definite article "La" as her
own, and it is the proper caper to gush
over "La" Loie Fuller, but the sad fact re
mains that she does not dance.
Just at the end oi La Lis dv Nil (com
mon or garden name, the lily) the hearts
of the lovers of Terpsichore beat high
with hope. "Now Loie is going to dance,"
they thoucht, as she tripped round the
stage several times, just as great ballerine
<lo when they are about to indulge in
a pyrotechmcal display of high kicking.
but these admirers of Terpsichore were
doomed to disappointment. After dc-
BcriDins; the last circle M;ss Fuller sank to
the ground, and the stage became dark.
For my part I felt inclined to u?e those
famous words o< the French marshal
when he saw the charge of the Light Bri
gade: "C'est inagnifique, mais cc nest
pas la danse'' â only he said "Cc nest pas
ia guerre."
"The End of the Century" is a startling
production with which the Alcazar Com
pany battles nobly. Its plot tells the story
of a beautiful American heiress who sod j
herself for rank to a dark and drea lful j
Russian conspirator (no one knew what
he conspired about, but conspiring was
his business, and a ba I business it proved
for him in the end). Although Barbara's
heart is breaking sne never for a moment
forgets that she has become a princess, j
and does credit to her exalted rank by
carrying herself with awe-inspiring dig
nity, and always wearing a coronet. I
Even in the dead of nieht, when
she pays a stealthy visit to the anarchists'
den, Barbara is arrayed in ail the glory of
a court gown and a costly gold-em broi- I
dered opera wrap with numerous dia- |
monds as the only covering to shelter her
head from the wintry blast â the stylo of
costume worn by princesses on all occa
sions in dime novels. Most of tbe other
characters keep up the Lady Clara Verede
Vere pace set by Miss Beatrice Lieb as
the Princess. They stalk about the stage
with haughty and disdainful gestures,
glare defiantly at one another, and are
dressed regardless of cost. The only people :
who escape this chilling and aristocratic I
ntmosphere are J. B. Polk, Frank B. Clay- j
ton and Miss May Buckley. They have \
the courage to be most plebeianly and re- 1
freshingly natural.
"The End of the Century" is the joint i
production of George Carey Eggleston I
and Dolores Marbourg, who must both
have pampered their imaginations well on
dime novels to find the necessary inspira- j
tion. Ido not mean to say that their
drama is not interesting; it fascinated me i
so much that I saw it twice and went ,
away reluctantly the second time when
the curtain fell, for I was consumed with !
curiosity to know what finally became of j
tho characters.
John Bra'J bury, a wealthy but unbusi
nesslike American, had gfven a million
nnd a half for a titled son-in-law, who
proved to be a combination of Prince
Zouroff in "Moths" and Mephistopheles
in "Faust" Barbara married the Prince
and after a scene which evoked memories
of "The Ironmaster" it was compacted
that "his Imperial Highness" tbonld call
her princess, but not vriie. In return for
this concession she swore to help him in
his business of conspiring and be his tool
and â¢ spy. After that she led a dual life,
conspiring in secret and receiving the
cream of St. Petersburg society in public.
But one day the Prince tried io railroad
one of Barbara's dearest friends to Siberia,
and the worm turned. There was a terri
ble scene in tt.e anarchists' den (the
anarchists seemed to iive in a reserva
tion) and Prince Kostoi was beginning to
trample on the worm again,, when in
rushed John Bradbury, with two soldiers,
and announced that he hnd searched the
archives and found Prince Kostoi's record.
At this statement the Prince quailed, then
he tried to brazen it out, but Bradbury
said he knew the whole record, and at that
tbe Prince wilted and went away to Siberia
with the soldiers.
As George Carey Eggleston' and Dolores
Murbourg did not kill off the'wicked Rus
. sian prince, they should gratify oar
natural curiosity and write an epilogue to
*Tlie End of the Century." For in
stance, they could easily show Princess
Barbara in the act of receiving her decree
Jbf divorce at Oklahoma, with her faithful
American admirer hovering in the fore
ground. This epilogue would also give '
the dramatists an opportunity of divulg
ing the nature of those terrible crimes,
* that John Bradbury found recorded in
the archives against Prince Kostoi. The
Russian police were very remiss not to
have unearthed them without the aid of
John Bradbury.
Poor John was terribly taken in when
he bought that Russian Prince with the
damaged reputation, more taken in than
the dramatists who made him had any
idea of, for they evidently labored under
o otheidea that Kostoi was a most exalted
personage, whereas princes are very small
beer in Russia â smaller beer even than
counts. When John Bradbury infla:ed his
imagination and called hisdarkand wicked
purchase "your imperial Highness" he was
simply talking through his hat and dally
ing with a prerogative of tbe Romanoff
lamily which would have brought him
into trouble if any spies had beeu around.
He had asmncli grounds for alluding to the
Prince as "nis Highness of Timbuctoo."
or "My son-in-law, the Khan of T.irtary,"
as he had :6r duboing him "your imperial
Highness."
It is highly creditable for a plain, hon
est American citizen to know nothing,
and care less, about such empty baubles
as titles, but when an American citizen
contemplates giving a cool million and a
half for a prince it is commercially un
wise not to learn the relative values of the
princes and princes that are to be found
in Europe. Poor John Bradbury evi
dently knew nothing of the market
(neither did the dramatists), and the con
sequence was that the confiding Brad
burys gave a million and a half for a
prince that would have been dear at fifty
thousand, and they regarded their pur
chase with as much awe and reverence as
if they had picked up an Imperial Grand
Duke at a Dargain counter.
But everything gops in Russin. It is
tbe very paradise of dramatists. In writ
ing about other lands the gentlemen and
ladies who build plays are to seme extent
hampered by facts and existing condi
tions. They cannot make Queen Victoria
cry, "Off with his head !" to every unlucky
wight who offends her Royal and Imperial
Highness; neither can they consistently
represent the President of the United
States as taking the part of a deu-? ex ma
china in the private affairs of the people
who dwell in the land of tiie free*. nnd the
home of the brave. But in Russia every
thing is allowable, ajid wi.en a character
becomes cumbersome, and the dramatist
does not want unnecessary bloodshed, he
can always be relegated to Siberia. Un
der tliesn happy dramatic conditions it is
no wonder that we have so many Russian
piays.
Women novelists of the* second-rate sort
have a singular affection for weaving sto
ries about one cherished plot â they marry
two people for raisons de convenance, and
then by slow and tortuous ways make
them fall In love wtfh one another. This
threadbare plot has been a fortune â sev
eral fortunesâ to the Duchess, and the
clever German novelist Marlitt holds her
trump card in it.
Sqace does not permit me to enumerate
the women npvelists who have daliied
with the same old story, but I see that
Madeline Lucette Ryley has now adopted
it as her own for stage purposes. In "An
American Citizen" she has succeeded bet
terwith it than she did with "Christopher
Jr.," in fact her latest play is really very
pretty, although frothy. Its chief merit
lies in the fact that it gives Goodwin an
opportunity to scintillate ence again in his
beloved rob of the lover, tender and true,
whose rugged honest virtues are not ap
preciated until the last act, and who
meanwhile it far too noble hearted to
divulge to the heroine the base qualities
that lurk beneath the polished surface of
the villain's immaculate shirt front.
That villain, Brown, was the crumpled
rose leaf in the play lor me. What was
the stage manager about, not *to compel
him to wear a wig? Frazer Coulter may
think that his hoary locks command re
spect, but when he wears them as the lover
of ft young and beauteous maiden, who
has been disinherited for love of him, he
makes himself and his appearance ridicu
lous. Perhaps he thinks that his snow
white locks have the appearance of being
cau?ed by a secret sorrow, bat he is
far too sleek and well-nourished looking
for that. Brown wa.s simply a prosperous
loofc.ng getttleman, well oast midille age,
who might easily Lave been mistaken for
Maxine Elliott's grandfather. â¢
There have been instances of young
girls cherishing romantic love for octo
genarians, but they have generally been
musicians, to wit: Simms Reeves and Sir
Julius Benedict. Brown's commonplace
appearance and tiis equaliy commonplpce
acting preclude the possibil ty of any
young girl cherishing a romantic regard
for him. Love-making between the fair
Maxine Efliott and tbe portly white
haired Brown was the sublime meeting
the ridiculous. If Brown wore a wie "An
American Citizen" would be a better play.

THE ROMANCE OF A GYPSY.
True Stonj of aj-lurvgariarv Violinist,
Which Reads Like a Ghapter
of Fiction.
In 1889 Falikarus Ferko, a Hungarian
pypsy, arrived in Paris at the head of a
troupe of Hungarian 'musicians, whom he
had recruited in his native country. The
Parisians heard him and app'auded him
for tUe first time at the exposition. They
were soon fascinated with this young man,
who, although guileless of method, plnyed
with exquisite art and performed on his
Hiradivariu^ the most wonderful varia
tions and devilish czardas. Now it was a
delicious melody, which seemed to de
scend straight from heaven, that escaped
from tne violin; then a'voluptuous dance,
then a warlike cadence which evoked
visions of tl.e wild Knights of Radoczy.
About the middle height, very thin,
nr.rrow chested and rlÂ«Â»licate looking, his
pale face framed in long, unkempt blnck
hair, Falikaru-s Ferlco represented tho
purest type of the gypsy of Puszvc â the
great Hungarian desert. As' soon as he
hnd seized his bow, his eyes shone with
extraordinary brilliancy, and shivers agi
tated his frail body. It seemed as if his
for.l parsed into bis violin.
After the close of the exposition. Ferko
and his otcbestra became a society fad.
| They were heard in the Champs" Elysces,
the Bois, in all the great houses of Paris.
One fine day hÂ° suddenly disappeared.
This disappearance was a sequel to a love
affair. One of his most assiduous auditors
had been enchanted by the gypÂ«y. The
daughter of a great Parisian merchant
prince, an orphan without ties and pos
sessing millions, Mile. Xââ had innumer
able pretendants to her hand, but she had
always shown herself pitiless to fortune
hunters, realizing that it was her dot and
not herself that they sought. Without
paying her any attentions, even
being aware of it, Ferko conquered the
heart of the haughty heiress.
Mile. Xâ â succeeded in alienating
FerKo from his comrades and also from
his family, for the Tzigane had brought
from Hungary. a wife and two children.
Mile. Xâ gave 20*000 francs to the wife
to return home with her children and
never let her husband hear, of ' ncr . ; again.
Ferko, liberated, became entirely hers, his
violin was hung to the wall ; of: her. salon,
i for he was to play for her only â for no one
! but her.
Thenceforth the gypsy lived like a veri
table nabob on money given him by Mile.
I X s â -. He roiled in his â¢ carriage, and his
i Docsets were full of gold; but alas ! lux
; ury and opulence soon intoxicated Ferko, \
j whose early years had been pajs-d in
j privation and misery. He forgot the days
j when his only consolation was the violin,
j by which he had gained his bread. Like
other rich people he wanted to go to the â 
club, the races, etc., and he began to
drink. .
In one year ho ran through a million
francs. The relatives of Mile. Xâ in- i
tervened and . applied to the , courts. â  A
guardian was appointed Tf or tha young
lady, but her income alone was enough to
keep up the extravagance. Madly in love
with the gypsy she shut her eyes to all
his shortcomings, and ; continued to sup
ply money for all his extravagances. But
dissipation was beginning to tell on him.
He /ell sick, and in spite of tender and
affectionate nursing be succumbed on the
2d in st., the day of the dead (All Souls'
Day). jMWlffiEBSmP 1 " 1
Mile. Xâ ordered a magnificent fu
neral for ; him at the . Church of : Notre
<iarae dcs Victoires. All the gypsies in
Paris were present. Had his life been
passed in toil Ferko would have died ob
scurely in some corner of his Tillage. â¢ The
oath of a gypsy is of little importance.
"It is like a "fly which falls," says an old
Hungarian proverb.' -As :: the ;. worthless
lover of a millionaire, Ferko : has " been in
â¢ terred at Pere Lachaise, in a flower-strewn
vault, near to where Musset and Thiers
lie.

J*liss Harrved to Retire.
Aimouncenients are just out of the en
eagement of E. H. Sothern to Miss Vir
ginia Harned, the original Trilby. The
troom elect says that they.have been en
gaged for some years, but "have kept the
matter to themselves as they did not
think it concerned the public.
i?othern is a Â»on of Â»he famous E. A.
Sothern of Lord Dundreary and David
Garrick fame. He created the leading
role in "Tne Prisoner of Zenua," wbirb
Hackctt played so successfully here. He
is now playing lead in ".An Enemy to the
King."
M iss Harned has been on t he stage for a
number of years. She was formerly a
Boston society actress. She recently ob
tained a divorce, but very little has ever
been mnde public about her life off tr.e
stage. She does not intend to act any
more after her marriage with Sothern.
Still an lrWalid.
The accident to John T. Sullivan in the
fencing scene at tbe Alcazar shows
j again the great need for carefulness
; in the stage duels which are such a pou-
I u.'ar craze at present. There is always an
j element of danger in fencing, even with
I foils, without masks, but when the
j swords have no buttons; even if they are
not really sharpened .at the point, a
tragedy is likely at any time to occur. In
London, only about two months ago, a
stu:.-e duel wan carelessly rehearsed with
lo. ls that happened to be handy. On the
night of the first performance the prop
j ertymau gave the duelis'.s a couple of
I property swords that seemed harmless
i weapon* enough, but aji accidental thrust
from one ot them resulted in the instant
death of one of the nctors. The manau'e-
ment, the propertynian nnd the unfor
tunate homicide nil came in for their
share of blame, bnt recriminations could
not bring tho dead man to life. It should
be an understood thing that the manage
ment is responsible lor the nature of tbe
weapons used in stage duels.

that she was as good as the French blue-pencil

been cansjht napping, and that he hÂ«d himself
sanctioned the singing of these very same
songs by othi-r artists. "Perfectly true," re
plied the Censor, "but it is a hors* of another

complaint dismissed.
A comedian is allowed a certain latitude
in tbe matter of changing his mind, and

but this action on the part of Mr. Good
win evidently took his wife and her attor
neys by surprise, for they since nave been
strugKiinÂ« to have that dismissal annulled
and set aside.
Judge Murphy has consented to hear
arguments on tiiis point, and it will come
up in Department 3 of the Superior Court
at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
Application was yesterday made for en
injunction to restrain Mr. G,odwin from
disposing of any of his property pending
the court's decision in this matter.

anxious to secure a free flow ot foodstuffs into tbe
; country. The Northwestern bia:e ra;lway has
I lowererl.us rates for grain from Kurachee to the
Hunjaub to facilitate the impoit ot Wheat from
abruad.

WORDS AND SIGNS
THAT MYSTIFIED
An Accused Murderer Si
lences the Dead Man's
Widow.
A Very Strange Scene Was
Enacted Before a Coroner's
Jury.
L. Palo Charged With Having Given
A. Parenti a Dose of Snl
phuric Acid.
An inquest was held yesterday on the
body of Agostino Parenti of 9 Vincent
Btreet, who died on the 21st from sul
phuric acid poisoning. According to the
man's dying statement Luigi Palo, a
bootblack, bad given him a white powder
on the day before Palo was arrested fcr
murder. Tbe inquest was productive of
. two"int<?restinz features â one the silencing
of the widow by Palo, wrro made use of
mysterious signs, and thÂ§ other that the
widow claimed that she had been swin
dled out of her homestead.;'
It will be remembered that on the 20th
Parenti, who was a musician, was sent to
the Receiving Hospital suffering from
poison and he died in a snort time alter.
' He told a remarkable story to this effect:
That he went with Palo to the sano. hills
back of the Cliff House on the evening
'before and that Palo threw him upon the
ground and forced a white powder down
his throat... It was not uiitil many hours
Jater that he be^an to feel its effects, he
Baid. As stated. Palo was arrested and
Fince then Detective Bohen and Officer
George McMahon have been at work on
the case.
Their investigation, backed by the fact
that Autopsy Physician Dr. C. L. Morgan
found that "Parenti died from sulphuric
. acid, led them to the conclusion that Par
c euti committed suicide and told the story
he dirt in order to gÂ« Palo into trouble
ior causing trouble Detween Parenti and
bis wife,
At the inquest yesterday Miohele Votto
and his wite Marie testified to Parenti
calling upon them at a late hour and tell
ing them about being poisoned by Paio.
He "was suffering and they took him to Dr.
liappin, who hud him sent to the hospital.
Tne- ai-cused Palo told a very straight
story and denied he had been. to the Cliff
House with Parenti on the day in question.
He accounted for t-very hour of the day
and said in the afternoon of that day he
was playing cards in a saloon. About
4:30 Parenti entered the t)lace. A little
litter P..10 went lo his supper.
Mrs. Parenti testified that jshe and tier
husband did jiot live ITaDpily together as
ne used to beat her. In the course of her
testimony she told of the transaction by
â¢which she- parted with her property. She
and her husband homesteaded the" lot at
9 Vincent street aod when they had
quarreled it was decided to sell it if a CU3
to Â»er could be 'Sound who would pay

likely to find a purchaser Mrs. Parenti |
and her husband asked him to. sell !
the house and Jot. According to the
woman's statement . Tannotook lier to
Attorney R ssi. where she signed by
a cross mark a paper. This, she
understood, was an agreement by which
she and her husband would equally divide
the proceeds of the sale.
Coroner Hawkins produced the paper,
which was in reality a deed conveying the
homestead to Tan no for & consideration
of $10. When Mrs. Parenti learned what
had been done she was simply wild, and
furiously demanded of Tanno, who was a
witness, that he give her the full amount
of the money. The woman had been hys
terical before, but she Was frantic after
her loss dawned upon her. It seemed im
possible to keep her quiet.
It was during one of these wild spells
that n stranee scene was enacted not down
on the programme. Tanno was testifying,
when like a she tiger the woman sprang
into the middle of the room and spoke
rapidly and wildly to him.
The witness drew back as if in fear of
something.
At this point Palo half arose from his
chair, snapped out one or two words that
none of the Italians present understood,
and made a mysterious motion across his
forehead a couple of times. The woman
stopped instantly and looked at Palo.
Their eyes met for a brief space of time.
The woman showed that she was con
quered, for she quieted instantly and
withdrew far into the rear of the next
room, where she remained silent during
the remainder of the inquest What the
sign and the words meant none but the
two knew.
Tanno resumed bis testimony and said
that he had purchased the homestead of
Parenti and his wife, but he did not tell
the amount he paid for it. "
Attorney Rossi testified to having made
out the deed and having seen "money
passed.' ' Amount not stated.
Dr. Morgan told thut he b*ad made a
chemical analysis of Parenti's stomach
and found that the man had died lrom
sulphuric acid poisoning. The inside of
the mouth and throat were frightfully
burned by the acid.
Afterward Dr. Morgan stated that it
would have been almost impossible for
one man lo have forced such a poison
down the throat of another without spill
ing the stuff over and burning the vic
tim's face. There was no external evi
dence of the acid having beten spilled over
the man's face.
After a large amount of material and
immaterial testimony had been given the
jury decided to find a verdict according to
the facts (deatn by poisLiiing), and to
charge Palo with mimier. Coroner Haw
kins was not pleased with tbe latter find
ing, but as the jurymen explained that it
vras in order that the matter should be
more thoroughly sifted he accepted it.

DISOBEYED AN
ORDER OF COURT
Warrants Out for the Ar
rest of Julius Thaler,
a Painter.
His Wife Applied for a Divorce
and He Sold the Commu
nity Property.
He Is Also Wanted on the Charge of
Obtaining Money by False
Pretenses.
Julius Thaler, a painter, who has fig
ured in the police and divorce courts, has
got himself into a peck of trouble, in
August Jast ,Â»ear Thaler was arrested on
the complaint of Tinie Nausbaum for be
trayal under promise of marriage. She
came from New York, after having saved
some rconey and procured a situation with
a family on Sutter street. While there
she met Thaler' and he, hearing that she
had saved money, made love to her and
finally induced her to live with him till
he had procured the money. Then he
abandoned her and she had him arrested.
Judge Low dismissed the case, as the evi
dence was not sufficient to sustain the al
legation in the complaint.
In January last Thaler married Amelia
Sternseher, who had some money, and he
opened a painishop at 122 Eleventh street.
Shortly after their marriage Thaler betan
to treat his wife shamefully, which fact is
! averred in a suit for divorce filed by her
iast October.
The case was assigned to Judge Slack's
court, ano through her attorney, Fred
Frey, the wife applied for and obtained an
injunction to restrain Thaler from dispos
ing of the household property, stocx in
the paintsbop and other effects.
The injunction was served upon Thaler
in du>- course, but he paid no attention to
it, and between last Saturday and Wednes
day he disposed" of all the property, and it
is said be cannot be found.
Judge Slacic has issued a bench warrant
for his arrest for disobeyinc an order of
the court, and it will go hard with him if
he is caught.
Thaler is also wanted on a charge of ob
taining money by false pretenses. Mon
day last he went to C. H. Spalding. liverv
stable keeper, Fifteenth and Valencia
streets. He had with him a horse and
wagon, whicii he had hired from another
liveryman. It is alleged he told Spaldinc
that the rig belonged to him. and as lie
was retirincr from business he would sell it
cheap. A bargain was struck, and Spald
ing got the rig for |80.
The owner of the horse and wagon dis
covered on Friday that Spalding had
them, and went to his stables demanding
his property. Spaldiog went to 122
Eleventh street and found that Thaler
had sold out and disappeared.
Yesterday morning he swore to a com
plaint in Judge Joachimsea's court

TRADEMARK IMITATED.
Croiae & Blackwell Sue Local Dealers
-ia Groan & â  Blackburn's
Goods.
Crosse & Blackwell of 21 Soho square,
London, Eng., have sued the Lewis Pack
ing Company for damages and ask for an
injunction to prevent the defendant from
selling olive oil that is put up in bottles to
imitate the bottles in which the plaintiffs
sell their oil. The plaintiffs aver that they
gained a valuable reputation by importing
and packing Italian olive oil, which is
labeled "Fine Lucca oil, imported by
Crosse & Blaekwell (vignette), by appoint
ment purveyors in ordinary to her Majesty,
21 Soho square, London ; twelve prize
medals, two gold medals, Paris, 1878."
This valuable representation, they al
lege, is being injured by the sale of an in
ferior quality of oii by the defendant
uuder a label bearing the words: "Fine
Lucca oil, imported by Gross & Black
burn (vignette), purveyors to the general
public, London; highest awards wherever
exhibited.'
The vignette on tbe Gross & Blackburn
oil ia said to be identical with that on the
Crosse & Blackwell bottles, and it ;a
averred that the names and address of
Gro33 <fc Blackburn are fraudulent, and
that the goods thus packed and labeled
in imitation of plaintiffs' goods are likely
to deceive the public, causing great loss
to the plaintiff?.
Crossfi & Blackwell have also sued
Lievre, Fricke & Lo. on a similar suit for
damape, etc., on account of handling the
Gross & Blackburn oil, and have sued O.
L. Cramer and Jane Doe Cramer, doing
business under the name of the Pniladel
phja Manufacturing Company, for in
vasions of their rights by selling inferior
olive oil and a quality of curry powder
bottled by Gross t t Blackburn in "imitation
of the article packed by the plaintiffs.
General relief is demanded, including an
accounting for losses sustained by the
plaintiffs, and confiscation of all imita
tion goods found in the possession of the
deienuants.

BALDWIN WANTS
LONGER RACES
The Noted Millionaire Picks
Flaws in the Eastern
Contests.
â¢
No Show, He Says, for Any
Horse That Does Not Get
Off First.
The Bookmakers Run Everything and
Audiences Are Lightâ Ha Will
Quit the Business.
Millionaire E. J. Baldwin, who has been
in the East for the last five months at
tending the great races at Sheepshead
Bay, Brooklyn, Morris Park and else
where, returned here yesterday. The
millionaire is looking very well after his
long absence. He says the races this year
on the Eastern tracks have been quite in
teresting, but in his judgment they have
all been too suort.
â¢'These little races," said the million
aire, "of five-eiahths of a mile and three
quarters of a mile ought to be at least a
mile or a mile and a quarter, and from
that up to two and a half miles. For
ihree-year-olds even, the races ought to be,
a mile or at least seven-eighths of a mile.
These short races are in the interest of
the bookmaker*. They are the only peo
ple who proht by them; they get about ail
the money. That is the trouble; the man
agers down there cater to the bookmakers
and the latter have It all their own way.
"The result is that they only get small
crowds out at the races. Feople won't go
and see these short runs; they are too
*oon over. They won't spend their money
that way. They don't like it. If I had
my way I would give such races as we
used to have eight or ten years ago â from
a mile up. I wuuld eet back to the cup
races â two and a quarter miles. When
you have tbese, or even one mile and a
quarter races, you get a big crowd.
â¢'i did fairly well down there this year,
but it takes most of the money to pay for
feits. That is the difficulty. Some stables
had to sell out to pay expenses, and some
of them didn't pay expenses even then.
1 would like to see the newspapers advo
cate longer races. Then you get some
thing that's worth going to see. The way
it is now the starter has everything in his
own hand. The horse that gets off first
wins the race. Bu; if you can get your
horses to go two or three times around
tbey all have a show, and you find out
that the people will be much oetter pleased
and there will be a far greater number of
them present. That is it â it's the "big
races tual letch out the crowds. That is
the way to get the real money. They
can't do it with these l.ttle short races
that are ended almost as &oon as they are
beeun.
"I am not going to enter my horses
East any more. It costs too much to take
them East, everything considered. My
horses are all for sale. I've got about fifty
two-year-oldsâ that is, they will be two

STOLE THE NICKELS.
Edward O'Connor Arrested for ' Open
ing and Robbing the Telephone
l'xllt'j.
Edward O'Connor, who until two
months ago was a lineman in the em
ploy of the Pacilic Telephone and Tele
graph Company, had two charges of petty
larceny preferred.against him at the City
Prison yesterday afternoon.
It is alleged that since his discharge
from the company he and another man
have been going around carrying with
them a coil of wire and a pair of climbers
and representing themselves as employes
of the company. By this means they
were able to rob the telephone boxes of
the nickels deposited therein.
The thefts were reported to the Dollce
and Detective Graham wa? detailed on
the case. He arrested O'Connor near his
residence, on Jones street," near Broad
way, yesterday.
One of the boxes robbed was in the office
of a lumber-yard ou Powell and Bay
streets. When O'Connor was discharged
he did not deliver up his key to the tele
phones and while opening the box in the
lumber-yard he broke the key, leaving the
broken piece in Lhe lock. The other charge
against him is for robbing the box in the
Alexandria -Hotel, Sutter and Jones
streets. There are several others, but they
will not be charged aeainst him. as the
police say there is sufficient evidence to
convict him on the two charges.
A FOEGEE'S INGRATITUDE.
Charles Montgomery Swindled by Louis
Cleveland Fillgbury.
Louis Cleveland Pillsbury, alias H. A.
Williams, a well-known forger and ex
convict, who was arrested a few days ago
by Detectives Dillon and Crockett on three
charges of forgery, had an additional
charge of forgery and on.c ef obtaining
money by false pretenses entered against
him yesterday.
On October 10, while running a saloon
at P^ighth and Folsom streets, it is claimed
In the warrant, he passed a forced check
for $30 upon Thomas MoKeon. butcher
1140 Folsom stroet. JlcKeon presented
the check at the First National Bank and
when he learned it was worthless he
threatened Pilisbury with arrest.
Pillsbury wrote n letter to Charles Mont
gomery of the Brooklyn Hotel, who bad
urged him to lead a better life, telling him
that he had got into trouble about the
check, that it was good and if Montgomery
would take up the check he would refund
the money as soon as he disposed of his
saloon business
Montgomery, thinking that Pillsbury
intended to lead an honest life, and be
lieving his statement that the check was
wood, advanced t c money to save him
from prosecution, hence the charge of ob
tair.ine money by false pretenses.
