NEW YORK'S
MAJORITY
Estimated at 725,000 in
Favor of William
McKinley.
FIGURES OF CHAIRMAN
HACKETT.
Vermont's Returns the Basis of
the Calculations Already
Made.
SOUND.MONEY DEMOCRATS IN
CONSULTATION.
Will Open Eastern Headquarters and
Take an Active Part in the
Campaign.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Bept. 16.â Affairs
were quiet to-day at Republican National
headquarters, and there were but few
callers. Senator Quay has not returned
to his desk, but is expected to be at work
to-morrow.
Chairman Hackett of the Republican
State Committee called early to-d iy.
When asked how he would estimate the
vote of the State of New York on the
basis of the returns from Vermont and
Maine Mr. Hackelt said:
"The estimates have been made and the
results are so startling that they appear
impossible, but I see no reason why they
should not hold good,
"The same reasons that affect the vote
in Vermont and Maine affect it in this
State. Now, following the percentage of
Republican gain in Vermont, New York
should give a majority of 725,000. Using
the Maine vote as a standard, our State
should give 630,000. The Democratic
mathematicians may work their brains on
these figures, and see if they can discover
any ground upon which the Bryan shout
ers base tt.eir assertion that New York is
uncertain."
The doings of the Democratic Btate Con
vention at Buffalo are being anxiously
watched at Democratic headquarters.
Treasurer St. John was early at his desk,
but he itfased to see reporters.
M. G. McLaughlin, who is Mr. Bt. John's
assistant, would not express an opinion
on the candidacy of Congressman Bulzer
for the nomination for Governor.
It is said there will be a meeting of the
Eastern members of The National Republi
can Committee to-morrow at which some
important work will be done.
William D. Bynum, chairman of the
National Committee of the sound-money
Democracy, had another conference with
other leading sound-money Democrats to
day. The New York branch headquarters
of tne National Committee will be opened
in a few days. General Charles Tracy of
Albany and George Foster Peabody will
be in charge.
Mark A. Hanna telegraphed to Republi
can headquarters this afternoon that he
would reach New York next Wednesday.
Senator J. B. Foraker, who has just re
turned from Europe, left this city to-day
for his home in Cincinnati. Senator For
aÃer siated that he believed Ohio would
give McKinley and Hobart 200,000 ma
jority. ______^_^____
HAVANA'S MONEY CRISIS,
Weyler's Financial Decree May
Bring on a Commercial
Pan.c.
Gold and Silver Shipped in Large
Quantities to the United
States.
HAVANA, Ctjba, Sept. 16.â The money
question is the all absorbing topic of the
hour. Ever since General Weyler issued his
famous de ree ordering the Spanish banks'
paper money to be accepted at par with
gold, it was foreseen tbat complications
would arise because, not having the Gov
ernment's proper guarantee, it could not
be accepted as a circulating medium.
The Government is doing all in its power
to sustain the value of the paper, threat
ening with severe penalties those who
refuse to accept it on the same basis with
gold.
The Spanish bank, with the assistance
of the Government, in order to uphold its
paper, announced its willingness to
accept it in payment of drafts on
Spain, but when one of the local
bankers âas a test case â solicited
from the bank a draft on Spain for $15,
000, the bank refused on the cround mat
it could not furnish bills to bankers Who
did not admit its paper in payment of
their exchanges.
By repudiating its own paper the bank
has initiated a crisis in financial circles,
which has upset the money trarket and
many believe will end in a commercial
panic.
Man? efforts are being made to avert
disaster by inducing General Weyler to al
low the quotation on exchange of the
paper currency that everybody should
know its exart intrinsic value, but it seems
Weyler stands firm on bis decree and does
not allow the least variation of his orders.
The result is that ever since then the
Stock ami Gold Exchange has not done
any operations and all quotations are con
sidered nominal.
On the other hand, all the bankers, in
order to avoid the penalties of Wey
ler's decree by refusing the accept
ance of paper in payment of
drafts, have decided to close their
exchange departments, allesinj that they
have no funds abroad to check against â
The San Francisco Call.
"WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?"
"Rainey is Boss again. He has captured the Democratic Municipal Convention," â San
Francisco Examiner,
except when they are offered gold â then
the draft is furnished.
The governor of the Spanish bank called
a meeting of all the backers three days
ago to see how the financial difficulty
could be solved, but no definite agreement
was reached and the situation continues
the same.
As a natural consequence of this
state of affairs the exportation of
gold and silver is being carried on
to a great extent, all the outgoing
steamers carrying considerable quantities
of the precious metals to Spain and the
United States, this being attributed to the
great distrust existing among the wealthy
classes regarding future prospects.
The announcement that the wholesale
arrests of prominent citizens made Saatur
day last was simply a Government plot
to remove whom it believes obnoxious
persons has been fully confirmed, at least
in the case of Alfreao Hernandez Huguet,
the American citizen arrested.
When the police overran his house in
search of incriminating papers his daugh
ter saw one of the men put a sus
picious document among his papers ana
seizing him by the arm, strongly protested
against the infamous act he was com m it
ing; but it was of no avail, for they car
ried that document as convincing evidence
of guilt.
Bhe went to see Ooncul-General LÂ»e and
told him the tale, and when the Consul
asked her if she had thecoaraee to lay the
facts before General Weyler she unhesi
tatingly assented.
It is understood both went to see the
general, and that he refused to listen to
her on the ground that he was not the
judge that had to decide the case, and that
sne should eive her testimony to the judge
who was to investigate th<> matter.
SULLIVAN NOT ARRESTED
French Papers Regard the Dyna
mite Scare as an English
Political Trick.
The Request for Tynan's Extradition

PARIS, Fbascb, Sept. 16.â 1n response
to inquiries ma.le at the Prefecture of
Police in regard to the rumor that Alex

leader. â¢ ad been arrested here, a repre
sentative of the United Associated Presses
was informed that not only was 'here no
trnth in the report that Mr. Sullivan had
been taken into custody, but tbat his
arrest had not even been meditated by the
French authorities.
The French public press systematically
ridicule thÂ« whole story oi the existence
of a dynamite c -nspiracy, whicli they de
clare is an English political trick intended
to interfere witn the proposed visit to
France of the Czar.
;Le,Soir, announces that two friends of
F. J. Tynan, the Irish invincible in ens

place, having gone there at the re
quest of the prisoner's mother. They
endeavored to secure permission to

that the French Cabinet gives, so lUtle
credence to the English police officials'
story of a dynamite conspiracy that it will

STEP OF GREAT GRAVITY
Sir Charles Dilke's Long and
Logical Letter on the
Subject.
FORESEES A GENERAL WAR
India, Canada and Australia Would
Be Forced In Probably Without
Their Consent
LONDON, Ewo., Bept. 16.â Lord Hugh
Richard Heathcote Cecil, fifth son of the
Marquis of Salisbury and member of the
House of Commons for Greenwich, has
written a letter expressing regret at his
inability to attend tne anti-Sultan meeting
in London, adding: "It wouid be danger
ous and misleading to the Armenians if
we made them believe that England alone
can save them. We cannot hope to save
them until the feeling abroad approaches
the excitement here."
Sir Charles Dilke has written a long,
reasoning letter, in which he says tbat if
Great Britain shall go to war she will
al-Â»o plunge Inaia, Canada and Australia
into war. possibly without their consent
Sir Charles ailds: "The forcible passage of
the Dardanelles might lead to a general
war, for which we are wholly unprepared,
and in which our very existence as a
power would be at stake."
In conclusion Sir Charles says: "Our
virtual protectorate over Egypt has de
stroyed in the minds of toe powers our
credit for clean hands in reiatio n to the
Ottoman empire."
The St. James Gazette, in an article
commenting upon the indifference of the
European powers in regard to ihc Turkish
massacres, proposes the formation of an
alliance between the United States and
Great Britain, in which Italy mignt possi
bly join.
"Alone among the nation? of the earth,"
the Gazette says, ":he Americans can
understand the impulse driving a free
people into war in order to rescue the op
pressed. If the th cc powers mentioned
should present a joint demand to the
Government at Constantinople it is im
probable that any serious employmentm ent of
force would be nÂ«;essary."
The Daily Chronicle will to-morrow give
its roost cordial indorsement to the plan
jroposed by the St. James Gazette for ihe
formation of an alliance be w en the
United States and Great Britain, in which
Italy might possibly join, for the suppres
sion of the Turkish outrages and will say
it hopes that the proposal wi.l rind an

TURKISH OFFICIAL REPORT.
Mind Rage of the English Press It Said
'/' to H" ' I>'Con*i*t*nt '
CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Sept. 16.
Turkish official circles have issued a
circular in which they gay they cannot
understand either the blind raze of
the English press against the Turk
ish Government or il>Â« sympathy
expressed for the Armenian annrchists
whose plans are merely a repetition of the
bomb-throwing of the Irish Fenians and
their menacing cf English buildings, for
the purpose of compelling the British
Government to come to terms. The
Armenian revolutionists, the statement
declares, have formed an infamous coali
tion with the nihilists and anarchists and
demolishes of society.
GROUNDING OF THE TEXAS.
The Battle-Ship Gets Into Shallow Water,
but t. Â» rapes Damage.
â  NEWPORT, R. 1., Sept. I.â The United
States steamer Texas arrived here last
evening and went agicuud in the sound
outside the torpedo station. At 1:40 x. m.
the battle-ship was â  released with the as
sistance of four tugs which set up a steady
strain at two bells and got her off after
slightly over half an hour's pulling. There
was jno rock under her and she is unin
jured. His going ashore was due to a mis-
understanding of orders in the engine
room. The port engine was not reversed
when it should have been. The Texas was
aground about seven hours.

HONOLULU, H. L, Bept 9.â The bark
Gainsborough, Captain Alexander Me-
Phail. went ashore off Diamond Head
early on Saturday morning, August 29.
THE BARK GAINSBOROUGH ON DIAMOND HEAD REEF.
She was making port for the purpose o
eetting a supply of fresh water when the
accident occurred.
The vessel is a tocal loss, and there is no
insurance on her. Her spars and rigging
have been removed and the wreck so d lor
$1825. The cargo of coal wili probably be
saved. No lives were lost.
HOW THE WEEK OCCURRED.
Story of the JHanster a* Told bt/ the
Captain.
Captain McPhail, accompanied by his
wife and four children, arrived on the
steamer Australia yesterday. He seems
to have taken the 10-s of vis vessel very
much to heart, and said the set of the
curr nt was the cause of all the trouble.
"We sailed from Westport, New Zea
lan-l," said he, "on Jane 23, 1896. with a
cargo of 1315 tons of coal fur San Fran
cisco. Good weather was met with most
of the way.
"Upon approaching the Hawaiian Islands
we were short of water, so I determined
to put in there for that necessary article.
"On Friday afternoon, August 28, we
were off the island of Molokai, and at 1
a. M. ou Saturday we righted Oahu. Our
course was shaped about four and a half
miles off shore, and as we approached the
place where the Gainsborough struck the
course was changed to Ã¼bout one and a
halt miles off shore.
"About 4:40 I went below to consult my
chart, and as I was doing this the steward
brought in the coffee. This finished 1 re
turned to my chart. Tuen I looked out
of the port to see where we were, ana to
my surprise found that we had gone a
good deal farther in than I had intended. I
could fairly feel the vessel being carried
toward shore by the force of the current,
and shuddered for what the next moment
would surely bring.
"Just at this time, about 5:30 a.m., I
felt her strike ana knew we bad gone
ashore as effectively as if the Gains
borough had been picked up and set on
the coral reef. I was owner of forty-tive
sixty-fourths of the Gainsborough, and as
there was not a cent of insurance on her
I wiil be the heaviest loser."
The Gainsborough has been mostly a
troop and coolie ship. For the last twelve
yeais she has confined her energies to the
wool trade in Australia.
During her career she has had no acci
dent whatever until the one Saturday
morning.
Captain McPhail has been master of the
vessel since January, 1884, and has since
that time acquired tne largest interest in
her, she being valued ataoout $15,000. He
will only remain here a short time to
square up accounts with F. Lnnd & Co.,
the agents of the Gainsborougli, after
which he and his family will sail for Eng
land.

CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 16.âVice-chair
man L. D. Arsley of the Congressional
committee, who has been making speeches
on the Pacific Coast, called on Mr. Mc-
Kinley to-day and brought him cheering
news from the far West. Mr. Apsley says
the situation on the Pacific Slope is im
proving daily from the Republican print
of view, and that he believes California,
Oregon and Washington will give substan
tial pluralities for McKinley and Robart.
â¢The people in those States want a fair
measure of protection for their indus
tries," said Mr. Apsley, "and they have
outgrown their free silver tendencies."
Major McKinley had a quiet day so far
as the coming of delegates is concerned,
but his callers were numerous. He has
prepared some of the speeches which he
expects to deliver later in the week. Ar
rangements for the big meeting to be held
here on Friday are going rapidly forward.
As the meeting is to be the formal open
ing of the campaign in the candidate's
own county, and as it is to be addressed
by Senators Thurston and Cnllnm, Gover
nor Hastings of Pennsylvania and Con
gressman McClearyof Minnesota, uncom
mon interest is being manifested in it.
There will be delegations here from Penn
sylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, In
diana and Michigan. Ten thousand peo
ple are expected from Pittsburg and
vicinity and an equally large number is
coming from Eastern Ohio. The Elkins
Cadets will come on a special train from
Wheeling and a delegation of 2000 bicy
clists is scheduled to arrive from Toledo.
Major McKmley will probably make a
short speech at both the afternoon and
evening meeting. Governor A. S. Bush
nell of Onio will bo president of the day,
when it is estimated that there will be up
ward of 40,000 visitors in Canton.
The Real Estate Men's Republican Club

BUCKNER TALKS
TO TENNESSEEANS
Memphis Address of the
National Democratic
Candidate.
BRYAN'S NAME CHEERED
Discussion of tlis Financial Ques
tion by the Kentucky
Leader.
SPEECH OF JOHN E. FELLOWS.
Free Coinage of Silver Denounced as
a Fraud Perpetrated Upon the
People.
MEMPHIS, Tsnr., Sept. 16.â General
Simon Buckner, Vice-Presidential candi
date of the National Democratic party,
and Colonel John R. Fellows, campaigner
for the Sound Money Leasme, to-night
addressed an audience of 2500 at the Audi
torium.
General Buckner was the first speaker
and at once took up the financial question.
He discussed it from the standpoint of its
elementary principles and contended that
if the stamp of. tne Government, by being
â¢.'laced upon a piece- of silver or of gold,
an give it a different value from
I. at in a commercial sense, that stamp
â an give any value it pleases, even to a
thousand times, so that the proposition is
reduced to an absurdity. He cited history
in support of his proposition that when
ever a country had undertaken to in.'use
this value into the metal by coining it the
result had been commercial convulsion,
consternation and strife among the people
and rebellion against the Government.
He denounced the proposition to deceive
as advocated by the advocates of free
silver coinage, insisting that it was noth
ing more than defrauding the people.
Touching the work of the Chicago conven
>iuu and its power to bind the Democracy,
General Buckuer said:
Last summer, under the regular organiza
tion of tlie Democratic) party, meetings were
called in every county in every State in the
Union. Delegates were appointed to' tut*
conventions, and State conventions appointed
delegates to the Chicago convention. - What
were those delegates instructed to do? In
nearly every county in the United .States the
first resolut.on parsed by me county meetings
was to reaffirm the principles of Democracy.
When the delegates thus instructed to dis
charge their duties as Democrats went 10 toe
State conventions, those State conventions,
alin&nt without an exception, reaffirmed the
principles of Democracy, and the delegates
that they sent to tlie Chicago convention were
obliged to suppOit Democratic principles.
Every sentiment of personal honor, of partisan
duty, compelled them to arrange their plat
form on Democratic lines and discard from it
everything that was not. [Applause.]
Waal did they do? rii â¢>â¢ went to Chicago
and arranged a. pluiform from which the last
vestige 01 Democracy had vauisned. 1 defy
any man to attempt to point to a single article
or a single line 01 that platform which enun
ciates Democratic doctrine. It announces as
principles of the Democratic) party principles
which we have coinbaitvd for a hundred
rears, from the time 01 Jefferson to this rood
Lour. Aud yet, lellow-cilizens, they have
laced upon that platform a man for caiidi-
Ua'e who has declared that be Is no Democrat.
Fellow-citizens, they say that we mast sup
) o t their candidate ana their platlorm be
cause it was done regularly. That reminds
me of an illustration which my distinguished
friend made a short time ago. . He said, under
the claim oi regularity, Benedict Arnold had
the right to claim the import of the patriots
of the Revolution. He was regularly com
missioned by his Government in toe patriot
army; he was iegu'arly commissioned under
the principles of West Point and the High
lands by General Washington; he issued or
ders through his staff regularly and in an en
tirely regular way; he issued orders which
disposed the Â«riny under his command and
placed it in such a positiou that the enemy
could come upon it and massacre the last
man. It was ail done with perfect regularity.
The only thing wauling was a little matter o
principle. [Applause.] Nor did it seem tube
in the mind; ol those gentlemen assembled in
Chicago professing to represent Democracy.
Tney said, what we have done was dove regu
larly.
Under that theory General Washington and
the Continental army were bolters because
they would not fotlow Arnold in bis treason.
Because we will not follow these gentlemen
at Chicago in their defection iroru Democratic
principles we are to be called bolters.
In the course of his speech General
Buckner mentioned the name of Bryan,
and no s-ooner had tne word left his
mouth than the house was the scene of
the wildest demonstration oT the evening.
The cheering continued until the chair
man of the meeting was compelled to ask
the audience to give the general a respect
ful hearing.
At tbe conclusion of General Buckner's
speech Colonel John K. Fellows was iutro
uuced. He said in part:
That the silver dollars and paper dollars of
this Government to-day are equal to gold, is
Uue to the method of the Government, by
which they are exchangeable for gold. The
Government keeps enougu reserve to make its
credit good before all the world, for the re
cif raption of Us promise that it will pay Us
debts in gold. "
What if tnat function should be destroyed?
Oh, says Mr. Bryan, I believe it you would 'give
us free and unlimited coinage at the
ratio of 16 to 1, the demand for silver
by this new issue you have given it,
would raise it at that ratio to a level
with gold. It would be worth $1 29 an ounce
Well, we simply say, but suppo.se it should not
Mr. Bryan, what then? Suppose the commer
cial world refuses to accept it at that value?
Have you ever stopped to thick what an awful
calamity would be precipitated upon this
country? If that single belief of Mr. Bryan
itt behaif of which he challenges the votes of
his countrymen, should not be realized as a
fact, not one hour would your gold remain as
a circulating medium in this country.
General Buckner and Co onel Fellows
left at 11:10 p. m. for Louisville.
HARD AND CARINED TO SPEAK.
Will Take the Stump it* Behalf of Hound
Money.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 16â Now
that Maine has voted speaker Reed will
be released to the country at large, and
there will be a lively demand for his serv
ices from all sections. In ail probability,
he will be heard principally in the Middle
and debatable Western States. Personally
he is is very popular in the West. In the
committee assignments of the House Mr.
Reed as Speaker treated Western men
with marked consideration, and this is
remembered cordially by them and their
constituents in Illinois,* lowa, Michigan,
Kansas and California, wtiere he lived lor
awhile. The Republican cause will greatly
be benefited by his participation iv the
campaign. -
Another strong speaker for sound
money soon to be heard in debatable ter
ritory is Secretary Carlisle. The demand
for him also is very great in Illinois, in
Indiana and in" his own Stato of Ken
tucky. Large audiences are certain to
greet him where ever .he may appear.
Chicago, Indianapolis, Louisville and
Lexington are mentioned as likely to be
remembered in the arranging of his pro
gramme, and even Nashville and
Memphis are suggested. Mr. Carlisle,
while not an orator in the sense that Mr.
Bryan and Mr. Cockran are orators, is yet
one of the most convincing of men on the
stump, ana is always in demand when tne
issues are important and the contest
spirited.
While the sound-money men are thus
felicitating themselves on the growing
strength of their stumping force Bryan
men are depressed. They have nobody to
tend after a man like Mr. Reed and Mr.
Carlisle. The embarrassment is only fully
to be mensured when it is considered that
Senator Gray, 6enalor Vilas, Kenator Llns
day, ex-Governor Waller and E. J. Pheips
have all been driven into opposition. Ex-
Governor Campbell is silent, and Senator
Hill can be of no service no matter what
the Buffalo convention may do. These
men are all capital speakers, and without
them Democracy, which ordinarily could
command their best efforts', goes begging.
Their places cannot be tilled.
WATHON WILL NOT RENION.
Will Remain on the Ticket to the Bitter
End.
LINCOLN, Nebb., Bept. 16.â The Lans
ing Theater was crowded to the doors this
afternoon, the attraction being Hon.
Thomas E. Watson's address on the is
sues of the campaign. Mr. Watson was
introduced by State Chairman E imiston
and spoke for an hour an I a half. His
speech was a defense of the Populist Na
tioual platform, and in no sense did the
Vice-Presidential candidate refer to Mr.
Sewall or the recent election in Maine.
Mr. Watson showed ihe manner of
"putting a nation In bondage" by dwell
ing upon the situation in Egypt and the
recent absorption of the Fiji Islands by
Great Britain. Quoting from a recent
speech of Major McKinley's, he endeav
ored to show the inconsistency of pro
tection and gold-standard finance, con
tending that, whereas, a high tariff would
raise prices of commodities, the apprecia
tion in the value of money under gold
monometallism would depress them.
Mr. Watson warmly eulogized Mr.
Bryan, aud when he said "I sincerely
hope and trust be will be elected," brought
out tremendous and long-continued ap
plause. He was particularly emphatic in
declaring that under no circumstances
would he withdraw from the race, saying:
"They put me on sentinel duty to hold a
place on the National ticket. They se
lected the post of duty, and without solici
tude, effort or desire on my part, selected

WANTS GOLD MEN TRIED
A Minnesota Politician Asks
That Bourke Cockran Be
Indicted.
Says That Tbrnsands Are Dying of
Starvation B cause of Scarcity
of Silver.
CHICAGO, 111., Hept.lG.â A special from
St. Paul, Minn., says:
Attorney-General Childs has been asked
to secure the indictment of Bourke Cock
ran while the New Yorker is within the
Slate mailing an address at Minneapolis
this evening. The complaint against
Cockrau is contained in a written com
munication signed by H. Ellingston, a
writer in favor of free silver.
Mr. Eilingntou maintains that the pres
ent depression is attributable and legally
traceable to the depreciation of prices due
to the criminal reduction of the amount
of legal tender money in circulation ty the
demonetization of silver.
A3 a direct result of this Ellington in
sists, that thousands Â are yearly dying of '
enforced starvation throughout this coun- j
try, in Minnesota, as well as, in the States '
where silver' mines have been forced to :
close, and he declares the blood of these
martyrs is on the hands of every official
who has an open part in the advocacy of
the maintenance and continuance of the I
present, as he terms it, unfair and parti- i
san standard.
Mr. EUingston demands that Bourke
Cockran, as the open and avowed apostle
of the conspiracy, be apprehended and
proceeded against with due form of law,
and with all t.'je legality necessary to the
preservation of the rights of -the American
citizen. Ellingston professes no desire to j
take snap judgment on any citizen, but \
says he demands that the rights of man- â 
kind be tried before tribunal? which the i
fathers of the Republic in their wisdom
established, and that persons responsible
for the terrible conditions which are caus- j
ing the death of thousands of human |
beings year after year be brought to jus- !
tice, regardless of political, social and !
other prominence and of prejudice to ex
isting political contests.
DO NOT LIKE FILLET'S WAYS.
.Missouri Republican* Obj'ot to Hit
Campaign. Method*.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 16.â A coraplain
inÂ« delegation of prominent Missouri Re
publicans arrived at National Committee
headquarters to-day and spent several
hours in secret conference with Chairman
Hanna and others in authority. They
made no concealment of their dissatis
faction with Chairman Filley's manner of
conducting the Missouri campaign aud
admitted that the object of their mission
was to present the true status of the party
affairs to Mr. Hanna, suggesting that Mr.
Filley be induced to turn over a new leaf
without delay and to ask that an abun
dance of literature and speakers be sent
into Missouri, or the State would be lost
to McKinley.
The delegation complained that stacks
of literature which bad been sent to the
State Committee in St. Louis was lying
there because the committee, which was
really Mr. Filley, had no money to distrib
ute the printed arguments among the coun
ty committees and elsewhere. Richard C.
Kerens, who was defeated by Mr. Filley
at the St. Louis convention, beaded the
delegation and snent yesterday in Canton
with Major McKinley idling him the
story. In the party were also Congress
man Nathan Frank ot St. Louis, Major
Bittin^er of St. Joseph. Samuel C. Scott
of Kansas City, Joset>h Parke of La Plata,
Lib Morse and E. J. Morse of Excelsior
Springs. M # r. Kerens said Mr. Filley was
confining his campaign work to St. Louis
and neglecting the rest of the State, al
lowing no one to advise or assist him.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1896.
HARMONY WITHOUT
AND HADES WITHIN
Convention of the Dem
ocratic Party in New
York.
SUPPOSEDLY FOR SILVER
Really Being Run by the Ad
vocates of the Single
Gold Standard.
SENATOR HILL IN COMMAND.
T<mmany Braves Hep to Nominate
a Ticket Which They Will
Surely Knife.
BUFFALO, N. V., Sept. 16.â The Demo,
cratic convention held a session of just
one hour and eighteen minutes to-day,
and adjourned until to-morrow morning
without effecting a permanent organiza
tion. It was free silver from the moment
ex-Senator Thomas F. Grady took the
gavel -as temporary chairman. His first
utterance in favor of Bryan and Sewall
and the restoration of silver was greeted
with tumultuous applause, which showed
plainly where the convention will stand.
Later on, a resolution indorsing Bryan
and Sewall and the Chicago platform, of
fered by J. W. Ridgeway of Kings County,
was greeted with cheers, but under tbe
rules was referred without action to the
committee on resolutions. The latter
body has put in several hours' work and
agrees to present a platform to-morrow
which indorses the Chicago platform as a
whole and pledges the support of the.
Democracy of the State to the Bryan and
Sewall ticket. It will be adopted with a
wnoop.
Just how much this action may aid
the Democratic National ticket is a ques
tion. There are men here with good pow
ers of observation who say that this is but
a silver-plated | convention, and that it
offers Mr. Bryan only empty honors, as
the sound-money Democrats predominate
in this State, and the men who openly in
dorse the regular .ticket for the sake of
regularity will knife it or trade it at the
polls in November.
There are many men who are sincere in
their silver views, and they are loudly
protesting against tbe manner in which
the organization is running the conven
tion. In tin first place they object to the
elated nominee, John Boyd Tnacher of
Albany, who is a sound-money man and
made a strong gold speech at the June 1
convention in Saratoga. Next they opject
to Frank Campbell, ex-Comptroller of the
State, who is slated for National commit
teenian. Mr. Campbell is associated with
the banking interests and is said to be a
sound-money man at . heart. The silver
men are not entirely satisfied as to the
conversion of Elliott Danforth, who has
always, beeu a sound-money man and
who is. slated to succeed Major James W.
lliuckley as chairman .of the Slate Com
mittee. ' . - . .
" There have been conferences of silver
men who are opposed to the machine pro
gramme, but the untis have not been able
to find a way to block the wheels. David
B. Hill has run things up to date as he
pleased by the aid of a long-distance tele
phone and the telegraph. The .Mate is un
broken, except that Catlin, Grout and
R.dgeway of Kings are not in second
place. Thomas Ryan, ex-Mayor of Syra
cuse, seems to be the most prominent
running-mate tor Thncher in sight.
James W. HincKley, chairman of the
State Committee, called the convention to
order at 12:30 p. M. and announced that
the State Committee had selected Thomas
F. Grady of New York for temporary
chairman.
Mr. Grady waÂ« greeted with faint hand
clapping. He started in at once with his
address and soon routed hearty applause
from the delegates and from spectators in
the galleries. . When he had finished he
was given three cheers ana a tiger..
James \V. Ridgeway of Kings ottered
the following resolution:
"Resolved, That the Democracy of the
State of New - York - m convention
assembled at the city of Buffalo
do hereby most heartily, indorse and
approve the platform adopted* by the
National Democracy at the Chicago con
vention in July last, and we hereby unre
servedly and unequivocally ratify and ap
prove of the nominees of said convention,
William Jennings Bryan and Arthur Sew
ail, and pledge them our earnest and cor
dial support in. their gallant fight for the
maintenance of Democracy and Demo
cratic principles."
A number of other resolutions were in
troduced and referred, among them being
one on Government control ol railroads.
The committee on platform was notified
to meet at 5 T. m., when the convention,
at 1:48, adjourned until to-morrow morn*
ing at 10 o clock.
The committee on permanent organiza
tion met at 4 p. x., aud selected!!. 1L
Rockwell of Chemung for permanent
chairman and the committee on creden
tials met at 4:30 p. m. Charles M. Bulger
of Oswego was elected chairman.
The committee on resolutions met
shortly after sp. St. at the Genesee. Ber
nard J. Yorke of Kings was made chair
man.
Tbe committee was confronted with a
stack of resolutions and proposed planks
a foot high, and the indications are that
their session will be a prolonged one.
James W. Hinckley declined re-election
to the Slate Committee from his (the
Thirteenth) district, though urged to do
so by the members of the delegation. A.
H. Green was elected in his place.
There was a lively time at the meeting
of the Kings County delegation. Senator
McCarren offered a resolution that the
delegates vote as a unit on ail questions
before tne convention. . It was lost by a
vote 17 to 41. ;.
The friends of Coffee and Ridgeway
claim to have captured the delegation by
electing the committeemen in all bat the
Third. Sixth and Seventh districts.
A conference of enti-Thacher delegates
were held this afternoon, and James W.
Ridgeway was. urged to stand in opposi
tion to the Albany man. He declined and
declared himself out of the contest.
Chairman Hinckley wired to Senator
Murphy tuis morning asking him to ac
cept the place on the National Committee
which would be vacant by the resignation
of William F. Sheeban. He received the
following reply :-
-"I would not accept under any con
ditions. I favor Frank Campbell for the
place." ..,
The committee on electors met at the
Iroauois Hotel this afternoon. The fol
lowing electors at large were chosen:
Robert P. Bush of Horsehead, Benjamin
Wood of New York. District electors were
also selected.
The Foil of Missouri.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Sept. 16.â poll of
Missouri by the Democratic State Central
Committee is nearly completed. Secre
i tary Love made an unofficial advance re
port to-day. \ He Mid :
""We find from the reports by school dis
tricts that there is very little defection
among the Democrats of the interior, and
that the Republican* are going to lose a
great many votes. Nearly every report
that comes to us Bbows a number of waver
ing Republicans. From what wÂ« have
learned since the canvass be can we are in
clined to believe that the State will give
Bryan a majority of nearly 70,000."
SECRETARY CARLISLE'S LETTER.
Chairman JPaulknur Say It Will Hurt
Republicanism.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Sept. 16.~"It is
the most astounding proposition I have
yet beard advanced by any man, and it
will make us thousands of votes."
Such was the exclamation of Chairman
Faulkner of the Democratic Congressional
Committee to-day after reading Secretary
Carlisle's letter.
"The sting to this letter ia concealed in
the midst of a lot of verbiage, but it comos
boldly to the front on careful reading,"
continued Senator Faulkner. "In view of
the Secretary'a letter to me and his pre
vious statements, I can only look upon
his present attitude as somelhin/, remark
able. It would force another issue of
bonds. In this letter Mr. Carlisle say*
that 'under auch conditions (lice coinage)
the Government would be compelled from
the beginning to exchange gold for sijrer
dollars and their paper representatives
whenever demanded, just ftÂ» it now ex
changes fold for its own notes when de
manded.'
"Suoh an announcement contemplates
an entire reversal ot tue established policy
of this Government aud would be a viola
tion of the law itself. The silver certifi
cate, on its face, is redeemable in silver
dollars and now the Secretary comes aloni?
with an advocacy of its redemption in
gold, and not only the silver certificates,
but the silver dollars themselves.
"Not more than two weeks ago I re
ceived a letter from the secretary which
1 gave publicity, in which he said that
gold had never been demauded in ex
change for auver during bis administra
tion, and that the records ot the depart
ment failed to show that such demands
had ever been made.
"The letter of the Secretary published
this morning is a*notu c to tbe bondiiold
era aud syndicates that if th** treasury
deem* it. necessary they will redeem silver
with sold. It is the proposed establish
ment of a condition that will compel
another issue of bonds. When the policy
of redeeming the greenback in gold was
inaugurated greenbacks were cornered and
becume the subject of speculation. Wften
treasury note* were held to be re
deemable in gold they likewise be
came tbe object of solicitude on
the part of the men engaged in the
business of cornering money. Now we
have tbeastouuding proposition to pay gold
for silver certilicates aud induce another
money corner tnat will contract our cur
rency to the point of retirement of the
only money that now does the business of
the people.
"Such propositions as this, or their mere
agitation, are sufficient to alarm the peo
ple, and Mr. Carlisle's letter it bound to be
of inestimable bnetit to those wuo are
fighting tbe battles of the Democratic
party."
RETURN FROM ARKANSAN.
Republican* Find f.aute for Jubilation
2 herein. \
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 16.â The
revised election returns from Arkansas
are affording the Republican managers
considerable satisfaction. Chairman Bab
cock was in a particularly cheerful humor
as he discussed the subject tnis afternoon.
"In the election of 1594," said he,
"Clarke, the Democratic nominee for
Governor, carried the State by 45.7-4
plurality and 'by a majority of 24,273.
Kemmel (R.) received 26,085 votes and
Barker (Pop.) 24,541. According to the
returns so far received from sixty-oae out
of sixty-five counties Jones (D.) received
71.6-15 votes, or 3164 less than Clarke re
ceived two year* ago. Kemmel, the Re
puolkan candidate, received 20,410. a gain
of nearly 4l>o votes, while tl>e Populists
lost 13,000 votes irom tLe vote they polled
two yours ago.
'Ttie sih'iiificance of all this lies in the
tumble Irom the heavy plurality of over
80,000 to a plurality of 33,000 or 15,000 less
than two years ago which bus taken place
since the "lirat reports of the recent elec
tion were given to the public by the
Democratic managers, witb a view of off
setting the Vermont tidal wave. Press
dispatches say tbe four counties vet to
hear from will not materially change tbe
result This is probably too optimistic
in view of the manner iv which election
returns are sometimes manipulated in
Arkansas. It would not surprise me if
the returns Irom those four counties were
held back to round out Jones' 'magnificent
victory. 1 "
FUSION IN ILLINOIS.
Democrat* Resign to Make Room for
fopUlittM. â â 
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 16.â Fusion of the
Democrats and Populists* on Presidential
electors, State ticket and Congressmen
was completed to-day at a meeting of the
Democratic State Central Committee. The
agreement had been made in detail by the
leaders on both sides beforehand, and only
tbe formal execution was needed to make
the fusion legal and binding.
Under the agreement the resignation of
Thomas Carey, elector at large of Chicago;
Justice George P. Foster of Chicago, Third
District elector, and George M. Lecroue of
Effingham, Nineteenth District elector,
were accepted and the vacancies tilled by
three Populistsâ H. E. Taubeneck, ex
chairman of the National Committee; Dr.
H. 8. Taylor, chairman of the Cook
i County committee, and Herman- Als
chuler, a Populist elector committed to
Watson. Andrew L. Maxwell, chairman
of the Populist State Committee, was put
on the Democratic ticket for State Auditor
in place of W. F. Beck, who resigned for
that purpose.
Lieutehant-GoverrÂ»or Gill's resignation
as a Democratic elector, because of differ
ences witn Governor Altgeld and lack of
sympathy witn the National platform, was
referred to the executive committee to
accept or not.
SOURRE COCKRAN'S REUETTION.

Would Hear Him.
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Sept. 16 âThe
demonstration this evening upon the ap
pearance of Bourke Cockran at tbe Expo
sition building in the advocacy of the elec
tion of William McKinley exceeded any
event of a political nature in the experi
ence of Minneapolis. Not less than 7000
people joined in the parade prior to ti:e
meeting, which was presided over by D.
W. Lawlor of St. Paul, Democratic Na
tional Committeeman for Minnesota.
Mr. Lawler introduced Mr. Cockran to
the vast audience and he was accorded an
ovation by 10,000 people when ho made his
appearance. He made a most forcible
and able speech on the lines of his pre
vious addresses during the campaign. In
the meantime the crowd outside was ap
yeased by speeches from local orators. It
was nearly midnight when tbe exercises
were finished and the audience dispersed.

BRYAN TALKS
FOR BUNCOMBE
Unique" Reception Accorded
the Democratic Nom
inee.
MET BY MOUNTED MEN
Escorted to Luncheon by a
Cavalcade Numbering a
Thousand.
ON HIS WAY TO CHABLOTTE
A Few Silver Utterances Dropped by
the Wayside by the Great
Boy Orator.
ASHEVILLE, N. C, Sept. 16.â William
J. Bryan has been "talking for Bun
combe." For weeks he has poured into
the ears of the people of the country, from
Nebraska to the sounding sea, a torrent of
talk that his political opponents have
often designated as "buncombe," and at
last he is convicted â caught in the act.
To-dr.y be imitated the Congressman of
long ago, who, rising to address the
House, and having no extraordinary
powers of manner or matter, drove most
of his audience from the building, then
naively told those remaining that they
might go, too, as ha was only "talking for
Buncombe." Asheville is the capital of
Buncombe County and for it Mr. Bryan
talked to-day.
Mr. Bryan was never received more
uniquely than in this famous mountain
resort. Arriving at 3 o'clock, accompanied
by a delegation from Knoxville, a recep
tion committee from Asheville and by a
number of prominent North Carolinians,
he was met oy a great cavalcade of men
and women mounted on all kinds of horse
flesh, from spiriied thoroughbreds to hard
worked mules. He was conveyed to the
Battery Park Hotel in a gayly decorated
carriage drawn by four horses, and with
him and tbe members of his party galloped
the mounted escort. The ladies who
formed part of it were attired in well
litting riding-habits and formed an agree
able feature of the procession.
Mr. Bryan's carriage was driven rapidly,
and the horsemen rode furiously along the
dusty streets, many of them shouting as
tney went and waving their hats in excess
of enthusiasm. It was a wildly hilarious
siirht, exceedingly picturesque, and the
tired candidate enjoyed it hirhly.
Luncheon was served at the Battery Park
Hotel to Mr. Bryan and the 'more promi
nent members of the Tennessee and North
Carolina^.ontiugents. E. P. McKissick,
the manager of the noted hostelry, was the
host and sat at the head of the table, with
Mr. Bryan at his right.
Cutting short the luncheon the party
proceeded, again under escort of the horse
men and horsewomen, estimated to num
ber more than 1000, to a natural amphi
theater near the Southern Railway depot,
where the candidate addressed an immense
audience. People from Buncombe County
and irom many other points in the State
largely swelled tbe Asheville contingent.
The bffies ol the hill on which the con
course was gathered were a solid mass of
humanity, numbering perhaps 30,000. Mr.
Bryan was introduced by Hon. Locke E.
Craig. The enthusiasm shown was of the
heartiest kind.
Mr. Bryan said :
1 hare a reason for coining to North Caro
lina which is personal, aside from my interest
in the electoral vote of this State. It was the
State Of Norm Carolina which at Chicago, be
fore I became a candidate, by resolution de
cided to give me the unanimous vote of its
delegaUou in that National convention. I
appreciate the honor which it was willing to
do me, and therefore It gives' me great pleas
ure to come among these people and give
what assistance I can, if any assistance bo
needed, to secure the electoral vote of this
State for the free coinage of silver at .16 to 1.
[Cheers:] ' :. . ; '1 "
1 am giad the canvass of this State opens in
tnis county, which was the home of one of the
grandest public men given to this Nation, not
alone by North Carolina, but the entire coun
tryâSenator Vance. [Great applause.] He was
a man whom I delighted to honor, and I am
glad to stand among his neighbors and friends
advocating the same cause he so eloquently
advocated.. - .
The Democratic Idea has been that a party it
but the instrument of those who compose it
and derives its power from the will of tne
voters who number themselves as members of
mat party. Yet it is often the case that the
party machinery or bosses have more to do
with shaping tbe policy and making the nomi
nations than tne voters themselves. I am
proud to be the nominee of a convention
which represented no machine, no bosses, but
the unpurchased suffrage of the voters of this
country. [Great applause.] In trying to do
rignt the Democratic party won a possibility of
success which it never could have hoped for if
It had consulted expediency. i Cheers.] I They
told us we must not disturb me harmony of
the party. They called us everything and
tried to make us pledge ourselves to abide the
decision at Chicago before we could go into
convention. I fur one told them whenever
they would bring a pledge that gold-stand
ard Democrats would take it would be time
enough to ask free-silver Democrats to make
pledges. [CheersJ
Now, when the Secretary of the Treasury de
nounced me as a Populist and said I had "said
I would not support tbe nominee I replied
that I. did not expect him to support the
nominee- if he were a free silver man. The
time came when he was put to the test, and
the only difference between him and me was
that I was candid enough to tell the people
that I would - follow my conscience, and be
tried to control a convention and then bolted
when be failed to do it. [Applause.] I have
sont nim no letter begging his support.
[Laughter.] Tbe highest compliment he can
pay me is to oppose me, because then- the
world will know the Secretary, of the Treas
ury whom I will appoint if elected will be as
different from bim as I can find. [Great ap
plause.] . . . â¢
When he had finished speaking- Mr.
Bryan was takeu to tbe Southern Railway
depot and left at 5 o'clock for Charlotte
on a special train furnished by the North
Carolina State Democratic Committee.
Knoxville, the seat of Republicanism in
Eastern Tennessee, was crowded with
people this morning to see and hear the
Democratic nominee. The train on which
i Mr. Bryan made the journey from Lex
ington, Ky., reached the Southern Railway
station at 8:30 a. m. Excursion trains
from all surrounding districts had brought
in carloads of farmers. Escorted by the
reception committee, Mr. Bryan wa^ con
veyed to a stand erected in front of the
courthouse. He was introduced by ex-
Governor Robert L. Taylor, who is a can
didate for the Gubernatorial office this
year. On the stand were Chief Justice
Snodgrass and Judges Beard, Caidwell,
McAllister . and Wiikes of the Supreme
Court of Tennessee and Judge Clark of the
United States District Court. Estimates
of the size of the concourse ran as high as
20,000. Mr. Bryan was loudly cheered
and his speech was frequently applauded.
Mr. Bryan said: ,
I come to you as a representative of a prin
ciple paramount in tnis campaign. It is thÂ«j
right of 70.000.000 of people to have just the
kind of .financial system that they want
whether any other foreign nations help to
have it or are willing Tor us to have it.
Against the maintenance of a gold standard
for one year or forever the Democratic t>artv
has arrayed Itself. : - â¢â¢-â¢â  f7* ;.
My friends, when you find a party which
tells you what it wants, and tells you how it
Is going to get it, and what in the judgment of
those who advocate it the effect of that policy i
will bo, you have the right to conclude that
they are honestly believing in the justice
oi the causa which they reprwout. When
you flnd people talking of an honest dollar
and then deal dishonestly with the people
with whom they come in contact, you have a
right to believe that they are not entirely de
voted to the canse of the people whom they
are not willing to take into their confidence.
WeasÃert that when they attempt to build a
financial system upon a money which they
cannot produce, they are building up an insa
cure structure upon an invisible foundation,
and are Insulting the iuielligence of those
who mean what they say and say what they
mean.
The train en which Mr. Bryan left
Knoxville for Asheville was a special en
paged by the Knoxville committee, and
the candidate was provided with every
comfort en route. ' The first stop was at
Mossy Creek, where several hundred peo
ple cheered Mr. Bryan.
At Morristown, Ter.n., Mr. Bryan
mounted tbe platform erected beside the
track and was introduced to an audience
of 2000 people by Hon. John T. Shields of
that place. Mr. Bryan spoke very briefly,
urging all to make a silver speech on elec
tion day by putting a cross in the right
place on the ballot. On tbe platform wad
a large lithograph of Mr. Bryan frozen into
a cake of ice. Mr, Bryan said he hoped it
uid not indicate he woulj receive a chilly
reception in Tennessee. Mr. Bhields re
plied tnat it only signified that the Demo
cratic candidate this year wascool-headed.
The train stopped at Alomstown live min
utes.
Hot Springs, N. C, was reached at 1:20
p. m. It was the first stop in North Caro
lina, and here Mr. Bryan was met by the
AshWille reception committee, headed by
John Y. Jordon, who bad come down on
a special car. Mr. Bryan made a speech
to a big crowd at Newport, the last place
tbat the train stopped in Tennessee.
HICKORY, N. C, Sept. 16.â After leav
ing Asheville tbe Bryan special was
stopped at Black Mountain in order tbat
tbe nominee might see the home uf tho
late Senator Vance. A couple of hundred
people cheered them there.
Tar barrels burned brightly at Marion
when tbe train reached that mountain
town at 8:45 o'clock and lighted up tbe
figures of several hundred people, who
hurrahed for tbe candidate. Mr. Bryan
told them something about the silver
question in a very husky voice.
There were more burning tar barrels at
Morganton, the seat of all the State asy
lums. People were packed soliJly on
both sides of the track for 100 feet or more.
They shouted as Mr. Bryan appeared on
the rear platform of his car.
Hickory gave Mr. Bryan a rousing re
ception when he arrived at 9 o'clock to
night. Fully 5000 people, many from
near-by places, received the nominee with
loud shouts when he appeared on tbe
temporary platform erected near, the

NABRASKA FOR McKINLEY.
Congressman Strode Predicts a Majority
of 10,000.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 16.âCon
gressman Jesse B. Strode represents the
First Congressional District of Nebraska
in the present Congress. This is the dis
trict formerly represented by William J.
Bryan. Mr. Strode is a Republican, and
was elected over Democrat- Populist and
Prohibitionist nominees. He lives in
Lincoln, and is a neighbor of Mr. Bryan's.
Speaking of political conditions in Ne
braska, he said to a Call correspondent:
"The electoral Tote of Nebraska will
surely be cast for McKinley and Hobart,
sound money and protectlou. The Re
pubiiean ticket will be successful by a ma
'j<Â»Tity ranging from 5000 to 15,000. Tbe
majority depends much on what takes
place as regards the tail end of the Popo
cratic ticket. If Sewall is withdrawn,
Bryan's chances will be weakened, be
cause there are many Democrats who do
not favor making it possible for a thor
oughbred Populist like Watson to become
Vice- President.
"Mr. Bryan will not carry his own voting
precinct. A recent poll showed that Mc-
Kinley and Hobart would poll 201 votes as
against 71 for Bryan. The Republicans
will carry the districtfby at least 2500 ma
jority, if tbe election bad been held one
month ago the Democrats would have
carried the State by from 10,000 to 15,000
majority. Now it is irredeemably lost to
Bryan. The canse of this great change is
because the great number of voters of Ne
braska have been carefully studying the
financial question, something they have
never done before. They have come to
the conclusion that they want no 53-cent
dollars in tueirs."

Is your sleep refreshing, or do you roll

that your sleep is disturbed, you roll and

Then you get up in the morning feeling

Your vital functions are sluggish. You

How is your appetite for breakfast and

Los Angklks, Cal., Sept." 16.)
During a lull in the proceedings of the
Populist County Convention in this
city yesterday, Edward L. Hutchi
son, chairman of the convention,
on his own motion offered to en
lighten bis party by relating what he
termed "inside history" at Chicago. Be
ing accorded the tioor be told how he bad
met Senator Stewart of Nevada, on his
way East at tne time of the Chicago con
vention and was surprised to learn how
strong an advocate for tbe referendum
Stewart was, and that the silver Senator
had recounted the converts wmch he had
won to that cause, among them being
Senator Tillman of South Carolina, and
W. J. Bryan ol Nebraska.
Hutchison said that the proposition to
include tbe referendum in the Chicago
platform of tbe Democrats bad been won
by the herculean efforts of Mr. Bryan in
tbe committee, and then other members
had entered the room and, 1 arning what
had been done, asked for n reconsidera
tion of that plank and succeeded in de
feating it by one vote only.
Hutchison taid tbat he agreed with Sen
ator Allen of Nebraska wno, in the late
National convention, had declared tbat
the gold and silver money of the country
represented only a record of so much
wasted labor in their production,
and that the money of tbe future
should all be of paper, irredeemable and
a full legal tender for debts, public and
private, to be issued direct by tue Govern
ment and in sufficient quantities for tbe
business of tbe country and to bear no
interest. This, the sptaker declared, was
the real monetary reform toward which
his party was rapidly hastening, and that
nothing short of this would ever give per
fect and complete freedom from financial
slavery. The rehabilitation of silver and
other monetary reforms were but straws in
thÂ» direction of such a boon.
These sentiments were cheered to the
echo by the assembled delegates.
SANTA BARBARA RALLI.
, Spanish' American Citizen* Addresied by
y_ ..,-. . - HÂ»-OotÂ»nior I'nehreo. . . . -~ :
. SANTA . BARBARA, Cal., Sept. 16.â
The Republican rally at the opera-house,
under the auspices of the McKinley Club, 'â 
was a grand success both as to numbers
and enthusiasm. The fact that the even
ing was to be especially Spanish in char
acter caused the attendance of the greater
part of the Spanish-American population
of this city. Many of those present came
to honor their fellow-townsman, Governor
Pacheco, who was tbe speaker of tbe even
ing. Twenty-five gentlemen, representing
the leading Spanish families of Santa Bar
bara, occupied chairs on the stage as vice
presidents of the meeting.
F. Gutierrez was introduced as the
chairman of the meeting. He addressed
the audience in Spanish, frequent ap
plause punctuating his . discourse. After
. instrumental music by the Spanish string
band of this city Hon. Romualdo Pacheco
was presented to the audience. He was
enthusiastically received, and his digni
fied bearing and line presence gained at
once the strict attention of ail.
Mr. Pacheco, though announced to
speak in Spanish, spoke for nearly an
hour in English. He addressed himself
to his old friends, spoke of the delight he
felt in visiting his native place, the pleas
ure it gave him to once more greet old ac
quaintances and of some of the earlier in
cidents of his life, especially of the time
when South California was about to pass
from the dominion of Mexico to that of
the United States.
At the conclusion of the reminiscent
part of his address, Mr. Pacheco took up
the political situation, and in & lorsible
and convincing rranner presented the
issues of the d ly. He held his audience
well in hand, and was interrupted t>y ire
quent applause. Af er hs En.-l s>i ad
dress, Mr. Pacheco spoke in Spanish for
half an hour. His paisanos listened as
one man, and beyond a doubt bis address
has caused many a wavering Spanish-
American to cast his vote on November 3
for McKinley.

ARCATA. Cal., Sept. 16.â The Mad
River bridge disaster of Sunday has
claimed another victim, making a total of
seven. Mrs. Gregorio died this morning
at 8 o'clock. She had not regained con
sciousness since the accident. Her baby
is still alive, but its chances for recovery
are slight.
The other victims of the catastrophe are
in no immediate danger, but tbe ultimate
outcome ot their injuries cannot be pre
dicted. The condition of Con uctor Har
vey Sammons is more precarious than that
of any ot tne ethers.
Tne town still wears its garb of mourn
ing. The funerals of the Wood babies and
the dead engineer, George Burke, were
held to-day. The stores and the schools
were all closed out of respect for the dead.
The bitter feeling against the company
has not abated. Pieces of the decayed
wood brought from the scene of the wreck
are exhibited. ThÂ« feeling grows tbat a
pennrioun spirit was responsible for the
great destruction of life and the disable
ment of many. A strange feature con
nected with the accident is that of all the
men on board not one had a bone broken,
while hardly a woman escaped without a
fracture. The men were all injured about
the head or scalded by steam from the
burst boiler.

LOS ANGELES MYSTERY.
Missing Editor Hanchett Sad to
Have Been Seen in
New Y.rk.
Robert Farrell Tells of a Recent
Meeting With the Long*
Scnght Man.
Los Angeles Ofhck of Thk Call, )
837 bEOADWAT, V
Los Augeles, Cat, Sept. 15.)
The question oi the exis>encs and where
abouts of H. J. Hanchett, formerly city
eiitor of the Herald of this city, is about
to be revived once more after a sleep of
three years. Hanchelt disappeared in
Chicago at the close of the World's Fair,
leaving a wife and two sons here and a
mother, Mrs. Griffiths, a schoolteacher of
many year- standing, in Sail Francisco.
The missing man was at the time secretary
of the Chamber of Commerce of this city
and had charge of the citrus exhibit at the
fair. He was well and widely known.
Hancbett had made his plans to return
to Los Angeles in company with several
acquaintances and baa invited a relative,
Dr. Smith of Chicago, to see him off. His
baggage was sent to the depot in time
for his train. Everything was in readi
ness for the trip, but Hanchett failed to
reach the station. T c train pulled ou
with his friends, except Dr. Smith, who
had left him a few minutes before and who
felt sure some accident had befallen him.
Atquaintances, relatives and friends
searched Chicago over and employed the
wires to the ends of civilization, but no
Hanchett could be found.
Occasionally since that day in Chicago
various rumors have been bruited about
as to Hancnett's i .entity and where
abouts. About three years ago Robert
Farrell of this city claims to have
met Hanchett at Sacramento and
been in bis company for two or
three days. Farrell's story was
then disputed. This gentleman has
just returned from an extended trip East,
and reiterates his former statement as to
Hnncheit's visit to Sacramento in 1893;
and he says further that while in New
Yorx City a few weeks ago be met Han
chett again and traveled with him to
several places, including Cleveland and
Chicago. Farrell says t!;Â»t he has been in
communication with Hanchett all the
time since his disappearance in Chicago.
Mrs. Hanchett and her friends discredit
Farrell's statements, ana persistently ex
press their belief that the absent editor is
not living, notwithstanding the fact that
they have no proof to submit in suDstan
tiation of tiie death theory.

CONSULATE FOR VICTORIA.
Li Hung Chang's Plans as Described to
Seattle Chineseâ New M.nister
to Washington.
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 16.â Mark Ten
Suie, Chin Gee Hee and Lee Yew Chue.
constituting the committee selected by
Chinese residents of Seattle to wait upon
Li Hung Chi n^ at Vancouver, have re
turned. They were given a cordial wel
come by the Viceroy, who also told them
something of his plans and purposes
which have not been made public. At the
close of Cleveland s administration, Li
informed them, it was his purpose to make j
one of bis sons, Li Ging Fong, successor j
to the present Minister at Washington.
Li Ging Fong is about 45 years old, is <aid
to be something of a diplomat and speaKs i
the Eng isu language fluently, often act
ing as interpreter for his honored parent.
Just before his departure from American
shore 5 , Li told Mark Ten Suie and Chin
Gee Hee that of the many countries en
tertaining him on his around tbe world
tour. Russia bad extended to him more
i ourtesie-s than any other nation, the
United States treating him w th second
greatest consideration and England being
third in order.
Many efforts wppe made to obtain infor
mation from Earl Li relative to Chinese
consulates in the Northwest, but to Chin
Gee Hee, a civil engineer and American
railroad builuer, whom the Viceroy. stated
would be in a short time summoned to j
China to aid the Government in its great j
scheme of railroad building, he announced j
his purpose of est blishing a consulate at
Victoria and possibly, later on, one at
Seattle.
Before his departure from Vancouver Li
Hung Chang called about him several
leadin Chinese who bad journeyed there
to pay him homage and v aye them some
wholesome advice. They were admonished
to as far as possible prohibit opium-smok
ing and gambling among their country
men here; to lead honest lives, abide by
tbe United States laws and especially to
learn to speak the English language, on
the ground that it would not only be of
great service to them while residents of !
this country, but would materially benefit
them upon their return to China to live,
which should be tbe constant aim and
cueribbed hope of every good Chinese.
SOUGHT SHASTA'S GOLD.
Treasurer Jackson's Story of a
Midnight Raid by
Outlaws.
Claims They Led Him to the County
Vaults, Where He Engaged
Them in Combat
REDDING, Cal., Sept. 16.â Between the
hoursof 3 and 4 this morning, according
to County Treasurer Jackson, three masked
men entered his residence, which he is at
present occupying alone, and demanded
that he go with them down to the court
house, about three blocks distant, and
open the money vaults. Mr. Jackson says
tbat they kept such a close watch on him
while he was dressing that it was impos
sible for him to obtain his pistol, which
* was close at band, but if he had been al
lowed the chance there would probably
have been one or two villains less at lar^e.
Jackson declares that they marched him
down to the cotirtbouse. and t at all the
way down he was trying to convince them
that their work would result in nothing,
as the vaults have a time lock and it
would be impossible for him to open
them, but they would not listen to his
ar ument but forced him on. When it
came to unlocking the office door he *ays
he gave it a sudden push acid at the same
time reached for a larte piece of ore, which
was iying on a taole to tne left of th^Â« door,
and with a sort of backhanded blow struck
| the first "wou:d-be" burglar in the face
j with it, knocking him down. Thereupon
one of the others hit him on the fÂ»ce with
his fist, knocking out a tooth, while an
other struck him ou the left temple with
the buit end of a pistol, rendering him un
conscious and cutting an ugly gash in his
head.
Jackson is not certain, but believes that
j he lay tnere for about twenty minntes be
fore returning to consciousness, and found
upon awakenine that his assailants had
departed without securing any booty. He
immediately came downtown to give the
alarm to thf officers, but as yet no arrests
have been made.
This was the story told by JackÂ«on
when he appeared before the watenman
of ihe depot note this morning, stagger
! ing like a drunken man and bleeding from
I his wounds. He is still very w<Â»afc and
I v g>ilv nervous, suffering from bruises on
head, leg and arm, and so badly dazed
I that he cannot tell a fully connected
.*tory. Good nursing to-nigbt and an ex
amination of the sat s to-morrow will
| cl ar a mystery now unfathomable.
Jackson has iong been tbe County
j Trebaurer and is ca led the watchdog of
the treasury. His wif^ and son are at
present in Oakland spending the summer.

MURDOCH FILES
HIS RESIGNATION
The State Fish and Game
Commissioner Desires
to Withdraw.
BUDD DELAYS ACTION.
He Says the Move Is Voluntary
on the Part of the
OificiaL
HIS TEEM OF OFFICE ENDED.
Other Members of the Board Not
Affectedâ Simply a Business
Proposition.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 16.â The
written resignation of James B. Murdock,
Fish and Game Commissioner of tne Stata
of California, has been received by
Governor Budd. As yet no official action
has been taken in the matte-, and this
fact, becoming known to a limited num
ber of lovers of sport in this locality, who
are interested heart and foul in the
preservation and propagation of the fowls
of tbe air and tbe finny tribes of the
stream, has created much comment and
speculation.
It is known to local sportsmen that dur
ing the latter part of the session of the last
Legislature Governor Budd was the recipi
ent of letters from influential sportsmen
of the State, wliicl., if not directly de
manding the resignation now on file in the
Governor's office, at lean advanced, it is
claimed, strong reasons why such a re
signation would bo extremely welcome.
This has weighed in the balance against
Commissioners Morrison and Emeric. In
quiry at the Governor's office, however,
absolves all the threatened sensation into
smoke.
"It is true that I received the written
resignation of James B. Murdock," said
Governor Budd thi- morning, "but it is
handed in because his term ba/i expired
and bis business interests require his time
and attention. The gentleman has been
desirous of beins relieved of his duties for
some time, but as yet I havo not seen fit
to relieve him, nor have I made up ray
mind as to what action I will take. There
is certainly no story in this resignation, it
being simply a business proposition."

MUTINY AT STANFORD.
Uprising of Freshmen Against
the Student Boiy Athetic
Committee.
They Objict to an Al!tg?d Usurpa
tin of Their Rights in
Football Affairs
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
16. â The executive committee of the stu
dent body met last evening and discussed
at some length <he question of authorizing
the stu lent body treasurer to make con
tracts for concerts of the glee and mando
lin club. It waa finally decided to grant
this authorization, and the treasurer left
to-day to complete arrangements for tbe
first concert in San Jose early in October.
The same committee added more enthus
iasm to the glee club interest by contribut
ing $30 a month to the expense of the
club's vocal trainer and director until
further notice. The club is bound to be
in better condition this year than ever
before, not only because of thÂ« mllux of
several excellent voices, but because of the
constant practice of the members under
professional supervision of the voice cul
ture of members.
Some oi the freshmen were inclined to
be indignant when the athletic committee
cf the student body undertook to manage
their football team tor them. The athletic
committee yesterday granted permission
to Varsity Football Manager Brown to
appoint an assistant manager, who should
take entire cnarge of the tresnmen eleven,
arrance lor its games and see that it made
a good showing lor the season. The fresh
men took effense, claiming that there was
a usurpation of their class privilege and a
break in all precedent. They appointed a
committee to confer with tbe athletic
board on the matter and a pacific settle
ment will doubtless be made. At any
rate t :e athletic committee intends to see
that an upper-classman has charge of the
team, arguing tliat it is done all over the
East in the big colleges. And further,
mat a freshman manager, however ener
getic he may ue, has not enough acquaint
ance with student affairs and manage
ment of important athletic contests to
make the most favorable arrangements
possible. Last season the freshmen had
tneir own manaeer, but he was lost Fight
of when the freshmen intercollegiate came
was being arranged, the regular Varsity
manager doing tbe business.
Ail the football men are awaiting the
arrival of the coach with interest. Hard
work will take place immediately en his
appearance. Just now the men are accus
toming themselves to the handling of the
ball and each evening there is a percep
tible change for the better. Not half the
candidates are out yet, but all will be on
hand as soon as sufficient outfits can be
bad.
AGUA DULCE FIESTA.
Fleet Indian Runners Bearing Messages
Race to Governor Sangine's
Headquarters.
BAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 16.â At En
senada and Asua Dulce, Lower California,
Mexican independence da)' was celebrated
to-day with picturesque ceremonies. At
Ensenaaa there was a big procession,
headed by Governor Sangines, a military
band and soldiers in white uniforms. Horse
races, bicycle contests and a grand bal
made up the celebration. ]
At A ua Dulce mining camp, which is
aoout forty-five miles east of Ensenada,
the festivities took on a wilder aspect!
About a dozen fleet young Indian runners
Jeft tbera early this morning, and word
was received from Ensenada at 1 o'clock
that Juan de la Cruz of the Santa Cata
rina tribe had arrived at tbe Governor's
office first and delivered his letter, receiv
ing an answer and starting back with it
immediately. The run of about ninety
miles was probably made in niucn less
than twelve hours.
Two miners named Sam Bullitt and
Tobe Caulkins have watered $100 each on
a drilling contest. Both are expert men
and have strong partisans among the
miners.
Not Jar from Aqua Dulce is a level plain,
presenting a fine place for horse racing.
There the Indians have about fifty horees,
and the Mexicans as many more. This is
the favorite sport, and all the money
obtainable in camp is put up, besides
saddles, bridles, horses and other col
lateral.
Ihe Cocopah Indians danced all Mon
day niKbt in Murphy's corral, going
through several of their weird ceremonies
They are very friendly with the Santa
Catarinas, but considerable jealousy
exists regarding the runners, and the race
to Ensenada has wrought them up to a
fever of excitement. The fiesta will last
untn Sunday night, if it does not continue
another week.

deed, of considerable general interest,
were discussed and acted upon. Amone
the measures adopted were plans for relief
work and preliminary action in the estab
lishment of a Catholic home for girls in
San Francisco.
The morning session opened with a
ceremony which included prayer and tbe
ode of the society sung by all delegates in
unison. In tbe absence of Mrs. Keegan,
erand junior vice-president, Mrs. M. F.
Dorsey tilled her chair during the council.
The convention decided to impose a fine

present at the opening of the council. A
motion was unanimously carried thai at
the installment of every branch the pass
word be communicated to the new presi
dent, who shall in turn impart 'it to
members.
Congratulatory telegrams were received
and read from Rev. Henry Wyman,
â superior of the Paullsts In Ban Franc sco;
also from Archbishop Riordan and other
prominent members of the clergy, all
expressing good wishes for the society.
A telegram of greeting was sent to Mrs.
Margaret Deane, grand president of the
order, now in Parts. Her resignation was
not accepted, and she was notitied that
inasmuch as she would be back from
Europe in a few months; her influence and
direction would be needed in the society.
Mrs. Deane has held the office of grand
president for six years, and been the chief
spirit of the society and its beautiful work.
Under her - personal supervision v and
through her personal efforts, the Santa
M&ria del Mar tract was secured, the Hotel
Del Mar built and maintained as a beau
tiful seaside resort.
By unanimous vote, the convention de
clared that the Catholic Ladies' Aid So
ciety discountenance all kinds of festivities
on holy days, Decoration day and All

subordinate branches have . mass ' cele
brated each year within the octave of All

When the afternoon. session was called
to order the following report was pre
sented by the committee on grand officers'

and sincere desire for the well-being of the
children of the Catholic Ladles' Aid - Society,
and gratifying to us in the highest degree, with
the exception of the paragraph containing her
resignation, and we commend her suggestions
to the carelul consideration of the members of
this Grand Council. We especially Indorse her
words of commendation of the management of
Del Mar, and we Join with Her in thanks to all
contributors to Its success. i<4o3
The committee recognizes the affection felt
by the board of directors and all other mem
bers of the society for our worthy foundress
and grand deputy, Mrs. M. Lohse. We call the
attention of the council to her statement in
regard to me omissions in the by-laws regard
ing the duties of the grand deputy. We tbaiik
her for her long continued interest in the so
ciety and beg her friendly aid lor the future.
The combined reports of our grand secretary

their respective positions. This committee
considers the society fortunate that its affairs
are confided to such trustworthy and gener

uties. The recommendation of Mrs.
Drane ttrat tbe grand deputies instruct
branches in parliamentary rulintr was ac
ceDted; also that, business of the meet
ings be confined to members of the
branch.
The council considered relief lists at
fame length. These lists contain reports
of relief work done in each branch of tbe
society, and by exchanging them among
the branches fraudulent recipients of
charity can be detected. It was accord
ingly determined to exchange the lists.
Relief committees of the branches will be
changed every three montns.
A clause in the grand president's report
favoring the establishment of lecture bu
reaus was indorsed.
The establishment of a yonne women's

home and if the project be found feasible
to cany it on to a successful conclusion.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 16.â The
fast ones of the 2:10 class draw a great
crowd to the track to-day. The weather
was perfect for racing, and aa the track
had been especially prepared for record
breaking those who expected to witness
some royal sport were not disappointed.
In the 2:10 trot the brown gelding Otiin
ger easily disposed of Stam U and the
other starters, winning in straight heats
in 2:11, 2:11. 2:10^. which now stands as
the coast race record for trotters. In the
2:10 race Aeitaio stepped a mile of his
winning race in 2:09^, and perhaps better.
Toe official timers hung out 2:09 flat and
gave the judges the fractional parts. Later,
probably out of accommodation to Win
ship & Keating, a quarter of a second was
tacked on to this time, thus leaving the
crack three-year-old eligible to the 2:10
class.
This is a practice that bas been too fre
quently indulged in during the past
season throughout the circuit and cannot
be too severely censured. It is certainly
an injustice to tbe owners of slower
horses, and why it is countenanced by
racing officials is not clear.
Many of the vast crowd present were
attracted by the announcement that VV.
A. Terrill, the San Francisco bicyclist, was
to go aeainst the game little pacer
Plunkett in a mile dash for a $12-5 purse,
and they left grievously disappointed, for
the horse defeated the blonde-headed
cyclist as easily as did W. Wood down
Oscar Osen at Petaluma during the fair
at that place.
Driver "Jimmy" Suiiivan, tbe "silent
man of the West," again captured tbe
better part of the 2:20 trot, decided under
the heat dash eystem, with the proud
steppins Mamie Griffin, taking the first
heat easily in 2:14. It was a grand day
for backers of the favorites, and the talent
quit well ahead.
It was expected that the Roc Klin horse,
Stam 13, would give Ottinger a not argu
ment in tbe 2:10 trot, which was tbe first
event called, but he failed to connect.
Ottinger sold favorite at 1-5, with Stam B
bringing $5 and the tie! > $3. Tbe favorite
took each heat as he liked, Sttm B finish
ing at his wheel in the first two heats.
Alteo was second in the deciding heat,
but could not extend the winner.
Tbe 2:10 pace was another lop-sided bet
ting arrangement. Agitato outclassed his
field, and pools were gobbled up at the
rate of $20 for the great Steinway gelding
and $7 tor the field. Bay wood, driven by
J. M. Nelson, gave him tbe semblance of a
battle in the opening beat, but after that
it was honey in the comb for him, he not
being compelled to go faster than 2 :l2>^.
Hazel H, driven by Van Bokkelen, whicn
iini-hed second in tbe second heat, was 26
to 1 in the books for the place.
Betting on the bicycle and horse contest
was not brisk. Terrill was favorite at
odds of 1 to 6, with 5 to 1 offered against
Plunicett. After scoring once before the
stand the word was given. Terrill trailed
behind the pacer to the half-pole, when
the horse began drawing away. Terrill
was evidently pumped out, for he finished
over an eighth of a mile behind the side
wheeler.
In her past races Mamie Griffin had
shown such speed that in the betting on '
the 2:20 trot she was a prohibitive choice
at odds of $10 to $4 over the field. After
taking the first three heats in most im
posing fashion she retired to the stable
and the other nine starters lined up for
the consolation heat ' Neernut, starting a
2 to 1 choice in the books, driven dv
Charles Durfee, was in front from the
word and took the beat with little to spare
from Clay S, handled by the veteran Den
nis Gannon. .

THE BUCKLEYITES
Supreme Court Grants Them
an Alternate Writ
of Mandate.
TO BE HEARD NEXT WEEK
A Case of National Legal Inter
est and Much Local Politi
cal Importance.
LAW, PACTS AND SMALL PULLS
The Fight Between Buckley and
Rainey Is Now Where McNab
Has No Proxies.
The great legal issue of the local cam
paign of this year was formally presented
to the Supreme Court yesterday, when the
petition of the .Buckleyites for a writ of
mandate directing Registrar Hinton to
accept the Buckley municipal ticket as
the Regular Democratic ticket was pre
sented to the court.
The court at once granted an alternative
writ of mandate, directing Registrar Hin
ton to show cause a week from next
Friday, the 25th inst., why the writ prayed
for should not be granted.
The case is of especial local interest, be
cause it will determine the legal standing
of not only the rival factions in the Demo
cratic party, but also the legal standing
of the Keily-Mahoney faction â if it may
be called a "faction"â in the local Republi
can party.
The case will acquire a National reputa
tion in legal circles because it will be a
highly important addition to the very few
pertinent cases which have got into the
"books" since the Australian ballot law
has been adopted, in one form or snu< or,
by nearly all the States of the Union.
The Australian ballot law recognizes
political parties as legal entities having
rights and equities. Under tne old laws
political organizations were mere volun
tary associations having no more legal
standing than a voluntary mass-meeting.
Under the new law political conventions
sre distinctly recognized, denned and
given powers and equities.
Section 1186 of the Political Code says:
"Any convention, as Hereinafter defined,
held for the purpose of making nomina
tions for public office, and also electors, to
the number hereinafter specified, may
nominate candidates for public office to
be filled by election within the State.
â¢'A convention, within the meaning of
this act, is an organized assemblage of
delegates representing a political party,
which at the last election before the hold
ing of such convention polled at least 3
per cent of the entire vote of the State,
county, district or other political division
for which the nomination is made."
The question is, Does the Buckley or
the Rainey convention represent the
Democratic political party which did un
que>tionably poll 3 per cent of the vete
cast at the last election?
The petition filed yesterday by the
Buckleyites was tiled in the name of D. A.
Macdonald, the candidate for Superin
tendent of Streets, who for legal purposes
represents the entire ticket. The opera
tion was attended to by Attorneys Joseph
Rothschild, Frieden rich, Heggerty, Hum
phrey and Dunne.
The case of the Buckleyites is not at all
displayed in the long petition filed. The
petition simply recites at much length a
story to the effect that the ticket filed is
the regular Democratic ticket entitled to
recognition under the law.
None of the disputed facts in the case
and none of the important legal conten
tentions are recited in the petition. These
things must appear from the pleadings of
the opposition.
The case is looked upon by lawyers as
one of National importance. The new
election law of this State, as do the new
election laws of most other States, recog
nizes a political convention as a thing
having riehts and equities. The conn
cannot, apparently, go into the field of
equity without going into the facts of the
case.
The Bucdeyites are generally recog
nized among lawyers as having far the
best of it, as far as both the facts and the
law are concerned. The facts show that
the Buckley organization is the regular
one, when the continuity of the political
organization is considered, and the com
paratively few pertinent decisions that
have been rendered since the Australian
ballot law has been established are all in
favor of the contention of the Buckleyites.
The Junta gains the prestige and posi
tion wholly from the fact that the Demo
cratic State Central Committee and the
Democratic State Convention recognized
it. This recognition, however, was, as is
well known, bestowed as a matter of po
litical policy and pull, and without any
consideration whatever of the facts in the
case.
The facts of the case involve the history
that the Junta was the result of a bolt of
a minority from the regular party general
committee.
The bolt was made during a stormy
meeting at Metropolitan Hall, when Gavin
McNab ordered the lights in the hall
turned out and when, amid pandemonium,
Chaiaman Watkins of the bolters arbi
trarily declared the general committee
adjourned sine die without putting the
question.
The "regulars" had a large majority of
the meeting, but the bolting minority set
.ud an independent organisation, and
later, by making it a matter of political
expediency and not a matter of right, se
cured recognition from the State political
bodies.
Now, for the first time, the Buckleyites
come to the front with a chance to secure
in an impartial court what they did not
get amid political turmoil â fair considera
tion of their claims to be the regular
party through their representing at all j
times a majority of the members of the j
regular party organization.
The field of facts involves not only that
stormy meeting when the McNab- Rainey
minority turned out the lights and broke
up the meeting, but it invdves the author
ity of that Deuprey committee which so
arbitrarily created the Junta organiza
tion.
It is thoneht that if the court decides to
go into the facts the case will be referred
to s commissioner. The Bucklf-y lawyers
do not think the Supreme Court will take
any particular notice of the action of the
State Convention.
A State convention has no legal author
ity to con&true laws, and where legai
equities are involved its action has no
weight. A Democratic State convention
might recognize a Populist. Republican or
Prohibition delegation as the "regular"
Democratic delegation, but that, it is
argued, would not. destroy the equities
under the law of the regular party organi
zation within the territory it represents.
One of the decisions the Buckieyites
have ready to present is a New York case
which, like all the other parallel cases re
ported, sustains their contention. In the
New York case the Court of Appeals said
that a State convention might recognizo
â¦ ] Ie wrong people and that its action did
not take a case from the jurisdiction of
the court.
The law as quoted above is asserted
to make, by its language, a conven
tion representing a political division, v
thing independent of conventions ot
all other political divisions. In this
view the city and county municipal
party has no more to do, in the eyes of the
law, with the party of the State than it
has with the corresponding party of some
other State. The question is, Will the
court consider and recognize the decision
of a boss-ruled committee, State or Na
tional convention as disposing of the
rights of a municipal organization be
stowed by law ?

BETRAYED BY THE X RAY
The Sad Predicament of a Young
Man at the Mechanics'
Fair.
Mexican Independence Night at the
Exposition â The Children
Made Happy.
The attendance at the Home Products
Exposition at the Mechanics' Pavilion
was as large last evening as ever. The
special feature of the evening was the
commemoration oi the anniversary of
Mexico's independence, and a special
musical programme was prepared for the
occasion, aside from the regular concert.
It consisted of solos, etc., by Kolander's
Mandolin Club. The participants were:
Professor Kolander, Mrs. N. Kolander,
E. Piquet, Miss Viola Cash, Mr. Walheim,
Miss Lord and Miss Bradley, banjos;
Miss M. Slagl, Miss L. Doherty, Mr. Char
ming and F. Kenny, mandolins; Miss
Lizzie Kutscher, Miss Schramm and L.
Isaacson, guitars.
During tbis afternoon the pupils of the
Douglass Primary, Everett Primary,
Hearst Grammar and Emerson Primary
schools took possession of the Pavilion
and enjoyed themselves hugely. To-day
the pupils of the Catholic parcchial schools
will enjoy the hospitality of the manage
ment of the exposition. Over 3000 invita
tions have been sent out and accepted by
St. Joseph's School, St. Peter's School, St.
Patrick's School and St. Mary's College of
Oakland.
To-night will be Irish night, held under
the auspices of the Celtic Union. An
elaborate programme has been prepared
by the committee of arrangements, of
which Jeremiah Deasy is chairman.
The thirty-six Irish organizations com
posing the union will turn out in full force.
An address on the manufactures of Ire
land, past and present, will be delivered
by the Hon. Joseph Leggett, who has been
selected orator of the evening.
Following is total vote cast for popular
exhibits at the fair up to date:
Crown Flour Company, 1039; Johnson-
Locke Company, 1115; Joshua Hendy Ma
chine Works, 1114; Laumeister Milling Com
fany, 445; Tillmann <fe Bendel, 651; Union
ron Works, 272; Zan Bros., 230; Fulton
Engine Works and Rix Compressed Air Ma
chinery Company, 363; American Biscuit
Company, 113; Fishbeck & Glootz, 175.
The X ray exhibit in the gallery is at
tracting much attention, but the X ray,
like the slumbering bulldog, is not a thing
to be trifled with. One young man found
this the fact to his sorrow last evening.
He was accompanied, evidently, by his in
tended and her mother. The young lady,
in a spirit of fun, declared that her escort
did not possess such an organ as a heart,
and he thoughtlessly offered to prove by
the X ray that he had such an organ. He
stood close to the screen upon which the
shadows are cast. While waiting devel
opments he conversed with the young
lady, while the elderly lady watched cu
riously.
Suddenly the X ray got in its work and
cast upon the screen the shadows of three
or four libs, a suspender-buckle and a
metallic pocket whisky flask, but no heart.
The 6id lady snorted with rage and de
clared that no daughter of hers should
ever have anything to do with a young
man who imbibed spirituous liquors
and carried the stuff about in pocket
flasks. The young man's explanation
that it was cough medicine was of no
avail. The old lady withdrew indignantly,
followed by the daughter sorrowfully,
while the young man hunted for a dark
corner where he could kick himself for
being such a fool as to trifle with an un
known quantity, and last of all the X ray.

MONTEITH WILL

Efforts to Pull Him Down
Have Been Una
vailing.
POPULISTS NOT HAPPY.
They and the Democrats Had a
Lively Fight in Con
vention.
AND NOSES WEEE PUNCHED.
Republicans Utilize Their Time in
Working for McKinley and
Protection.
George W. Monteith. Populist and un
fused candidate for Congress from the
First District, declares that he will remain
in the field for principle and will make
the best fight which his slender means
will allow him to do.
All kinds of pressure have been brought
to bear to induce him to resign. The
Populists and Democrats of the district
are by no means harmonious. The other
day at a convention held at Healdsburg
the farmers and mechanics were tumbled
around very promiscuously. The conven
tion had been stuffed with a few Demo
crats from Santa Rosa of the Geary fac
tion, and they at once proceeded to teach
the agricultural element some lessons in
parliamentary law that are not to be found
in Cushing or Roberts.
Resolutions were introduced by the
Democrats and put to the vote without
the noes being called. The Populists were
jobbed most unmercifully and in the
coarsest manner. The meeting broke up
in a row in which Editor Ditmar of the
Populist paper in Redding came out con
siderably the worse for wear.
OHIO CLUB.
Permanent Officers Elected of a
Rousing Organization of Sons
of the Buckeye State.
The Ohio Republican Club was organ
ized last evening at a meeting held at the
Auditorium in pursuance of a call dated
September 14, and signed by Norman
Arter, as temporary chairman, and L. P.
McCarty, the statistician, as temporary
secretary. The purposes of the meeting
were stated in the call to be the election
of permanent officers and the adoption of
rules and regulations for the government
of the club, and these purposes wsre ful
filled. One peculiarity of the organiza
tion is tnat it is composed exclusively of
natives of Ohio. The committee which
has taken in hand the preliminary work
discovered that there are upward of 1400
natives of Ohio in the City of San Fran
cisco alone, so that the basis of Â» large
club is assured.
Tne following were elected the perma
nent officers of the organization: Colonel
J. P. Jackson president, Norman Aner
first vice-president, Charles Woolpert sec
cond vice-president, W. -G. Richardson
treasurer, L. P. McCarty recording secre
tary, Oren B. Fogle, B. F. Garrett and
Theodore Reichert executive committee.
During the coming week a committee,
consisting of the president, secretary and
Andrew Jackson, will arrange for calling a
meeting, which will be attended it is hoped
by the 1400 Ohioans and perhaps others.
In addition to the list of 1400 natives, all
of whom will be invited to become active
members of the club, many others who
were born ouiÂ«ide of Ohio, but who have
resided in that State, will be considered
for honorary membership. The present
membership of the organization embraces
many very prominent citizens.
McKINLEY VETERANS.
A Rousing Meeting With a Loyal
Speech by President Mc-
Cormlck.
The McKinley Veteran League held a
well-attended meeting last night at Swiss
Hall, corner Mission and Fourteenth
streets, Colonel E. McCormick in the chair
and Orderly Sergeant Thomas Regan act
ing as secretary. Veterans from San Jose,
Santa Cruz, Redwood City and Colma were
present.
Captain William Bolwin, John Fair
child, Major Frank Clark ana J. Duffy
were appointed a recruiting committee.
Lieutenant-Colonel L. B. Marks, J.
Smith, Captain F. A. Blanchard, Quarter
master; J. A. Becssy and Captain J. Ryan
were appointed a committee to detect
fraudulent registration.
Captain H. Â£. Barrett, Orderly Sergeant
Thomas Regan, Michael Quinn, James
Stevens and Arthur Ropers were appointed
a committee to arrange for a big mass
meeting in the near future.
President McCormick made an address
brimful of patriotism. The following is
an extract:
After the election of Hon. Eugene F. Loud
and a majority of Republican Congressmen
and after the casting of his vote wiih the Re
publican majority in the electoral college for
McKinley and Hobart by the Hon. Claus
Spreckels, the greatest benefactor of our State
an Ameiican protective tariff will be assured'
confidence will be immediately restored and
hoarded and frightened capital will once more
be used to foster American industries, money
will again be Invested in public and private
enterprises and labor will again find employ
ment at wages as good as in former years of
prosperity under Republican administrations.
Af ier the apdause had subsided Captain
Kreuzer of the Swiss Veterans, called lor
three cheers for McKinley and Hobart
Eugene F. Loud and John D. Spreckels'
which were given with a wiil.
LIKE FORGERY.
gitlzens' Names Used by Fakers

San Francisco. Bept 16, 1896
City Editor of the Morning Callâ Dear Sir-
The Mahoney-Kelly-Spear aggregation have
chosen Dr. J. E. Artigues as one oi their dele
gate? to their would-be municipal convention
from the Forty-fourth Assembly District. Dr.
J. K. Ariiguesiias this moment requested me
to inform you tnat he never authorized any
person to use his name as a delegate or for any
other purpose, and that he emphatically de
clines the questionable honor thrust upon him
ana refuses to have anything whatever to do
with the above peculiar combination of poli
ticians. MoÂ«t respectfully yours,
P. A. Bergerot, 142-143 Crocker building.
About a score of persons who were de
clared elected at those so-called primaries
have declared that their names were used
without their knowledge or consent; that
they do not care to associate with the
handful of queer people who are manipu
lating those liliputian politics, and that
they consider t. at an unwarrantable lib
erty has been taken with their names.
Here is another:
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: The in
sertion of my name in the list of delegates to
the "Republican convention" is error.
I have never authorized such action, and I
respectfully request you to state tnat I am not
such delegate. Yours truly,
ItDWAKD LAOTK.

Colonel M. S. Blackburn commanding,
held an enthusiastic meeting at 26 O'Far
rell street, the department headquarters,
last night.
After the regular business of the league
was gone through with, speeches were
made by Colonel Charles Â£. Wilson,
Colonel J. C. Currier and Hon. Thomas
B. O'Brien, candidate for Congress from
the Fourth District.
A resolution was unanimously adopted
indorsing Mr. O'Brien's candidacy and
pledging him the hearty support "of the
league. His remarks in part were as
follows:
I deem it an honor to appear before the
saviors of the Union. The men who are before
me are sprinkled with dust from the rugged
road of time, but the flag of liberty and Re
publicanism for which they offered up their
lives to perpetuate and preserve still em
blazons the sky. The soldiers in the legions
of Cresar {ought for pillage and conquest, but
the soldiers of Grant, Sheridan and Sberman
fought to perpetuate liberty, an undivided
Union "Wit ti meilce toward none and charity
toward all."
Your achievements for liberty and law will
De sung by poets and narrated by sages along
the decades oi time, aud after ages as they
rise exultlugly wlil proclaim blessings on the
veteran's name.
But I am not here this evening to eulogize,
but to tell you that lam running for Con
gress in the Fourth District, aud I know that
you are eager to hear of the faith that is in me.
The people oi this State and Nation are anx
iously awulting the result o: your ballots in
next November. When I say the Nation 1
refer to the majority who are nauseated with
the abominable curse of English free trade.
Unfortunately this district is misrepresented at
Washington by a fanatical disciple oi Cobden.
My opponent is a philan.hropist to the foreign
ers of Europe and Asia, because he would con
vert our Nation into a free warehouse lor their
products. He would allow the ship-builders
of the Clyde and Thames to drive out our
Scotts and suppress the fires at the Union
Iron Works. He would permit our men and
women to starve and be would feed the aliens
of the world.
He has a mania for theory and an aversion
for lact. He grows superfluous on remote im
practicabilities, ai d grows eloquent upon the
Chinese one-string fiddle â his crazy quilt re
striction.
It Is needless to say that my opponent has re
munerated the mechanics of this district with
jawbone vapor.upon which they cautiot subsist,
and has given them a postoffice site filled with
Democratic auger-holes. The postoffli-es at
Sacramento and San Jose are completed aud
occupied, but alas, ours is a permanent re
minder of the ancient sand bed thai gave shel
ter to the army of want whooccupied it under
Democratic rule.
This is an American year, and the gal'ant
soldier. McKinley, who was your comrade
when foes from within and sympathizers from
without aimed to dissever the Republic you
fought to preserve, will occupy the seats of
your former comrades. Grant, Hayes and Har
rison. Under the regime ot the gallant Mc-
Kinley we will have perpetuated the system so
auspiciously begun by Lincoln,
When no caste barrier stays the poor man's son,
Till step by step the topmost heights are won.
FINED FOR CONTEMPT.
Judge Coffer Aaseftied Attorney J. P.
Langhorne SIOO for Slapping
W. H. H. Hart.
Judge Coffey yesterday fined Attorney
J. P. Langborne $100 for contempt of court
for having slapped the face of W. H. H.
Hart during an altercation in the Probate
Court on Tuesday.
Langhorne was ordered to appear at 11
o'clock yesterday morning for punish
ment. He apologized to the court for his
action, saying he has the greatest respect
for Judge Coffey, both personally and as a
Judge, and that he was sorry the episode
occurred. He also announced his readi
ness to pay the penalty for hia outburst of
temper.
Judge Coffey took occasion to make a
few ill-natured remarks about the press
and concluded by saying that he could
not accept the check for $100 with which
Langhorne offered to nay his fine, bnt that
cash must be forthcoming. The Hendy
case was then postponed until the fine is
paid.

A BIG NIGHT
FOR SILVER'S CAUSE
Francis P. Newlands Ad
dresses a House Full
of People.
WANTS SOUND MONEY.
Hon. F. M. Taylor of Colorado
Served as Proxy for
Senator Teller.
OVERFLOW MEETING OUTSIDE.
Preparations to B? Made for a Series
of Mass-Meetings in the
City.
The meeting at Metropolitan Temple,
held last evening under the auspices of
the California Silver Committee, rilled
that big ball and a large overflow meeting
was held in front of the building. A
brass band and bonfires helped to create
the enthusiasm and attract the crowd.
George W. Baker, as chairman of the
Silver Committee, called the big meeting
to order, and in doing so took occasion to
say:
"About twelve months ago we held a
silver convention in this hall, represent
ing, as the silver committee is now com
posed, Democrats, Republicans and Popu
lists. At that time we were denominated
ascranlts; now we are called anarchists.
We have the satisfaction of knowing that
whatever we are we have the majority of
the people of this country with us." He
then introduced John M. Wright.
"In every cri-is of the Government," said
the speaker, "the very man most adapted
for the need of the time has arisen. In
the time of the Revolution a George Wash
ington was there; when a man was need
ed to define the principles of the cause
Thomas Jefferson was there; when the
time came to define the position of this
Government with regard to other
Governments on this continent a
Monroe was there; Webster arose
to deliver the greatest of constitutional
definitions; when trouble arose over the
national bank question Andrew Jackson
settled it; when the Union was threat
ened with destruction because of the
rooting of slavery in the South Abraham
Lincoln proved its savior. A leader of
the armies was found in Grant. And
now v question is before the Ameri
can people for settlement as grave
and as important as any ~ of
these great leaders were confronted
with. The Republican party, always a
progressive party until now, has taken the
stand against the side of the people. At
Sacramento the party was disposed to do
the right thing, but when its delegates ar
rived at St. Louis they found conditions
against which they could make no stand.
At Chicago a leader of the people arose â
the man as we know of tbis campaign â
as though the great Jehovah had said to
him, 'Speak to the people,' and William
J. Bryan has spoken. [Great applause.]
1 was at tirst in doubt as to the spirit in
which the people gathered to hear him,
they came in such multitudes. Why, they
gather in such throngs that it is like the
throng that goes to witness a circus. But
1 know the spirit that moves them. My
friends, they look upon him as a savior."
After the singing of campaign songs
by a quartet, the Hon. M. F. Taylor of
Denver was introduced as representing
Senator Teller, who had been unable to
accept an invitation to be present.
Mr. Taylor paid the usual happy com
pliments to California end its people, but
said he bad since coming here been greatly
confused as to the politics of the
people here. They were supposed
to be all one way at first, but
now were greatly mixed. He would tell
of the things and the people at his horne â
Colorado. The word â¢â¢Colorado" provoked
prolonged applause. The people of Colo
rado, he said, needed no telegram from
London or France to know what the peo
ple there thought about it. This country,
he thought, was equal to its own. They
had followed the banners and listened
to the promises of Republican and
Democrat and been as patient
as they could until they saw
disaster follow fast and follow faster,
blighting their homes, and now they had
cut loose from the parties and stood for
their birthright as plain people of this
great country. He came here, he said, not
as a Democrat; not as a Republican â even
a silver Republican, if you please;
not as a Populist; but as a citizen 01
the country, determined to see the
tires kindled upon the hearthstones of our
homes again. "Somewhere to-night," he
said, "in the Middle West, facing multi
tudes, no one leaning over his shoulder to
tell him what to say, a plain citizen, a
champion of the people, Wiiliam Jennings
Bryan [applause] is declaring anew tite
independence of the United States." [Ap
plause.]
"They tell us that the silver dollar at 16
to 1 will be a 53-cent dollar; that we must
wait until England shall make it a 100
-cent dollar. For my part I am like the
boy who at the baking of pie on Saturday,
to be eaten, on Sunday, declared, 'I want
my part of it now.' I see no reason
in waiting until some other nation
shall make good our own Ameri
can dollar. We are better able to
make it good and without regard
to any other man or nation than we were
when only a handful of ragged rebels at
Valley Forge 115 years ago." [Appiau^e.l
Telling a story of the successful singing of
the song of "the sword of Bunker Hill"
he said : "I am here not to raise the
sword of Bunker Hill, but the spirit of
Bunker Hill. I appeal to you: 'Do for
your country what is "best for it
and do not wait for the bidding
of any nation on earth.' You are told that
the mills will be opened if McKinley is
elected. You know that phey might be
stacked to the turrets with manufactures
and you would yet be unable to purchase
the smallest fraction, because you have
not the money." [Applause.]
Some more music oroke the thread of
the silver oratory, and then the orator of
the evening, Francis G. Newlands, was in
troduced:
Mr. Newlands said:
After a few preliminary remarks, Mr.
Newlands said:
In treating this question, I wish to state that
the silver men believÂ« in sound and honest
money. They do not believe in depreciaiad
money or fifty-cent dollars, but they do be
lieve in maintaining the equal debt-paying
power, and the equal value of all dollars,
whether gold, sliver or paper. We only differ
with our opponents as to the methods by which
tbis equality of value and of power snail De
maintained. Our opponents insist that until
an international agreement can be effected
gold shall be the only primary money, and
that silver shall simply be regarded as the
material upon which a promise to pay gold is
stamped. And they insist that no more silver
dollars shall be coined. We insist, on the
contrary, that both gold and silver shall be re
garded as primary money, and that the old
relative value of silver to gold shall be restored
and maintained by giving to silver equal
privileges under the law.
I assume that you all believe that anenlischt
ened seli-interest should govern nations, just
as it does individuals, and that the interests
of nations vary.
The nations of the world are divided into
two classesâ creditor nations and debtor na
tions.
In reviewing the nations of the world we
find that there are very few creditor nations,
and they are principally Eneland, Germany
and France, for Belgium and Holland do not
figure largaiy in international transactions.
Where is this gold located? We refer to the
statistical report of out Mint Director, and we
find that to-day $2,000,000,000, one-half of
the accumulated supply, is located in Eng
land, France and Germany, and the other
$2,000,000,000 is scattered over the rest oi the
world, but is tied to these countries by the
strings of bond and mortgage, so that it can be
withdrawn at any time by the action of the
creditor nations through the sale of securities
in the country that has issued them.
This is the age of trusts and combines. The
prevailing idea is to control some product,
limit the production, raise the price and nmke
a profit. The scarcer the thing monopolized
the more efficient is the trust or combination.
Throughout the ages nature has only yielded
enough gold, in visible iorm to-day in the
shape of money, to fill a cube of twenty-two
feet. What more favorable subject could
there be for a combine or Wust than gold?
And wno would organize such a trust? The
people who own the gold. And how would
they make that combination effective? Not by
limiting the production of gold, because that
is limited enougn; but by destroying the use
of its only competitorâ silverâ which through
out the ages and until 1873 stood with gold as
one of the acknowledged money metals. The
production of money was to be limited by the
destruction of the use of silver through legal
enactment, by denying it coinage and legal
tender equality. And this the United States,
persuaded by some occult influence, proceeded
to do in 1873.
At that time specie payments were sus
ptnded, as they had been during the entire
war, and there was no accumulated stock of
either gold or sliver in the country. Yet our
country led the crusade of the debtor nations
against silver. And though Providence had
exposed the richest silver treasures as a means
wiih which to pay our great debt contracted
during the war, this country, owning no gold,
having no interest in the gold trust, but the
greatest producer of silver in the world, the
greatest debtor in the world,, owing debts
which it had obligated itself to pay in coin,
either gold or silver, absolutely denied itself
at a time when the silver in the silver dollar
was worth 3 cents more than the gold in the
gold dollar, the power to use its silver mines,
and not only destroyed the legal tender qual
ity of the existing silver coin, but denied silver
bullion admisfiion to its mints, so that not an
ounce of silver could be turned into legal ten
der coin. We thus became the greatest cus
tomer in the world oi the gold trust. Aud the
result has been the accumulation of a foreign
debt unequaled in the history of the world.
But.we are told that the production of gold
is largely increasing and that that will make
up for the destruction of silver as money. It
is ttue it has increased, for everybody is look
ing for it. But the production is by no means
commensurate with the wants of the world.
The dominant position of England, France
and Germany will be increased so long as the
gold standard is maintained by debtor nations.
Mr. Newlands contended that the Re
publican piatform confined an inter
national conference to the leading com
mercial nations of the world. These na
tions were England, France and Germany,
the beneficiaries of the gold trust. Was it
ever known that the beneficiaries of a
monopoly would willingly relax their
grasp?
As to the accumulated slock of coin in the
various countries none of it would come to our
mints. It is iv actual use as coin, and no ad
vantage wou.d be gained by simply changing
the stamp.
The exaggerations concerning silver are
marvelous. One would think from the news
paper accounts that every storehouse ana
vault was bursting with silver. As a matter
of fnct, and you can refer to the Mint Director
as authority, all the silver coin in the world
amounts to a little less than $4. 000, 000,000,
and all this coin can be put in a cube of sixty
six feet, or a space about the size of this audi
torium. This Droves that there never has
been enough metallic money produced to sup
ply the wurW.
The people of the United States cannot wait
for the slow processes of international ar
rangement even with debtor nations.
It is clear if we maintain our greenback sys

tem and redemption in gold we will have to
issue more bonds, or else we will have to retire
our greenbacks and issue other money in their
place. The question is whether :his money
shall be bank paper redeemable in gold or
metallic money coined from our silver mines
1 maintain, therefore, that the free coinage
of silver at the rate of 16 to 1 by this country
is practicable, that it will restore the old rela
tive value of silver and gold, release this coun
try from its dependence on loreign countries,
impair the efficiency of the cheap labor of sil
ver standard countries in competition with our
own, restore the value of our asricultural
products with which we pay our debts abroad
and save this country from a manufacturing
competition that will prove destructive.
With a view to protecting the products of
this country, whether from the farm or fac
tory, against the production of silver standard
countries, our policy should be by the in
creased use oi silver to pull up the value ol
silver, and by withdrawing the demand for
gold to pull down the value of gold.soasto
restore the old relation of 15JÂ£ or 16 ounces of
silver to lof gold. By doing this we will take
away at least one-half of the efficiency of the
competing labor of silver-standard countries.
All parties have declared that this object is
commendable; that it is desirable that bimet
allism should be restored, and that such an
i increased use of silver should be created as to
' restore its parity with gold, so that both metals
i will concurrently circulate. The only differ
ence is as to the method of doing this; and,
while international action is desirable, it is
not necessary.
The tariff legislation promised proper secur
ity 10 the manufacturing interests of the coun
try against the products of tne cheap labor of
| Europe, and the monetary legislation promised
| the agricultural interests of the country secur
! ity against the disastrous competition of sil
: ver-siundtird countries. It also promised a re
| nuwal of the mining industry oi six States and
three Territories, whose basic industry was
silver.
upon the successful prosecution ol this in
dustry depended all the correlated industries
of commerce, agriculture, banking and trans
portation in this vast; area, comprising neariy
one-third of the entire country. The revival
of that region was of vast importance to San
Francisco, separated as it was. built up as it
was, first by gold mining and later on by
silver mining. It had suffered severely from
the prostration of the mining region, and
would profit greatly by its restoration. Thus,
by the equal protection and development of
the manufacturing, agricultural and mining
interests of the entire country the country
would grow harmoniously. And with a
restorat.ou of equitable relations between tho
creditor and debtor, and between the pro
ducers end consumers, a beneficent era of
prosperity would follow.
Before allowing the crowd to disperse
the chairman announced that Hon.
Joseph J. Dwyer will speak at Metropoli

silver ciubs expected to attend.

WILLIAM McKINLET, of Obio
FOB TICF-PRBRIDEXT-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
EJECTION NOVEMBER 3, 1898.
Gold will be freer to workingmen under
a protective tariff than silver will be under
free trade.
Now that Bryan has gone to Kentucky
to talk, we may be sure the State is going
for McKinley.
The campaign of Teller, Boies, Dubois
and Bland is thoroughly golden in one re
spect: It is silent.
Sewall may know he has had enough,
but he seems determined to keep his feet
in the trough just the same.
The latest Democratic scheme is to get
Sewall and Watson to get off tbe ticket
and settle their little controversy by a dog
fall.
Bryan has never favored protectif n to
any American industry, and, therefore,
has no claim on the support of any 'man
engaged in industry.
Wherever you find a sound business
man or a sound working: man you find &
man who favors sound money and protec
tion, for they are essential to both busi
ness and work.
Bryan went to Kentucky to avoid the
frost of Maine and was caught in a rain
storm at his first stopping place, so it
seems he cannot have things favorable to
him in any part of the country.
Every speech made by McKinley raises
him in tne estimation of the public, and
the people are beginning to regard him
as tbe ideal leader, whom they can follow
with love as well as with loyalty.
International bimetallism is a move
ment to improve the conditions of in
dustry, but the Bryan scheme of silver
monometallism is ai Bourke Cockran
said, "a conspiracy against wages. "
The remonetization of silver can be safely
effected by statesmen supported by the
business men of the country, but the
people will not intrust it to the party of
bungling and confusion, led by a man
more noted for his rhetoric than for state
craft.
If any man wishes to know what is bÂ«st
for the country at this time, let him com
pare the condition of his industry under
tne Gorman tariff with what it was before
the Democratic panic set in and he will
see at once what is needed and know just
how to vote.
"It is immaterial in my judgment
whether the sheep-grower receives any
benefit from the tariff or not," said Mr.
Bryan, when talking for free trade, and
the peoDle can learn from that statement
just how much Bryan cares for any
American industry.
To promote industry and provide for the
revival of business the Republican party
offers the country protection, reciprocity
and international bimetallism, while the
Popocrats offer nothing but silver mono
metallism and even that is to be accom
panied with free trade and the competi
tion of the cheapest labor countries in the
â¢world.
Under Republican administrations the
National debt was decreased by over $1,881,
-000,000, while under the present Demo
cratic administration the debt has been
increased by over $257,000,000. With these
facts in mind the voter can early decide
for himself which sort of administration is
best for the Nation and the people who
have to pay its debts.
As this campaign is conducted with the
object of devising the best means of pro
moting the industries of the country it
Ehoula not be overlooked that a Republi
can administration would revive tne reci
procity system which Democracy broke
down and would thereby open large mar
kets to our manufacturers and fartners
without surrendering a single day's wage
of any workingman in the United States.
The nimblest and most agile rainbow
chaser of the season is Senator Jones,
chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. He has performed the aston
ishing task of finding a rainbow for his
party in the Maine election ana in the face
of the biggest Republican vote in the his
tory of the State cheerfully points out that
the Democrats cast 3000 votes more than
in 1894 and claims that as "a marvelous
gain for silver."
"It is my serious and solemn opinion
that the full recognition of silver will
come soon and tbat it will come through
the efforts and under the direction of the
Republican party." These words of Sen
ator Wolcott addressed to 10,000 persons at
Colorado Springs won their approval and
undoubtedly express the sentiments of
Western Republicans generally. To have
silver safely remonetized we must first
have the success of the Republican party.
IN DESPERATE STRAITS.
Divided, disorganized, demoralized, de
spondent, Democracy finds itself in des
perate straits, and turn which way it will
it can find neither a safo path to take nor
a wise leader to follow. When, in the Chi
cago convention, it broke in mad folly
from its established paths and its accus
tomed leaders it undertook to blaze out a
way for fusion with Populism, and as a re
sult both it and its allies, the Populists,
are now wandering In darkness, blind
leaders of the blind, who know neither
whither they are going nor where they
shall stop.
Never in the History of our country did
a great political party approach a Presi
dential election in such a confused and
disordered rout as tbat of Democracy at
the present time. It matters not whether
we consider the condition of the party in
the Nation, In a State or In a city, we find
everywhere the same blind bungling and
blundering. The leaders or bosses, or what
ever they are who are in command, are
moved by the same folly of seeking Popu
list allies at the expense of losing the con
servative and stalwart element of their own
party. A species of political insanity im
pels them to denounce Cleveland, Palmer,
Hill, Carlisle, Whitney and Caffery for the
purpose of cornering the favor of Peffer,
Tiliman, Allen and Mrs. Lease.
Half-hearted even in their folly and be
wildered in the confusion of untried
ways, these blind leaders of Democracy
are unable to act with vigor or consistency
on the course they have decided to takp.
Having driven the conservative Demo
crats out of the camp they still hesitate
to carry their bargain with the Populists
to its logical conclusion. They keep the
millionaire Bewall on their ticket for
Vice-President despite the cry of the Pop
ulists clamoring that he shall be taken
down and Watson substituted- This strife
over the Vice-Presidency disturbs the
party leaders so that they cannot attend
to the campaign and fills their councils
with a confusion worse confounded. How
gladly they would get rid of both if they
could is known to every one, but they
have neither the wisdom to devise a com
promise oor the courage to enforce one.
In this confusion and demoralization it
is of course impossible to carry on an ef
fective campaign. The days go by, but
no voice is heard for the fusion save that
of the wandering boy orator of tbe Platte.
The men who were expected to lead the
onset of aggressive free silver, Teller,
Boies, Matthews, Blackburn, Crisp, Dan
iel and Bland, are all silent. Some of them
have spoken once or twice, but none has
entered with any vigor into tiie campaign.
Even the Populists have assumed an un
wonted silence, and Peffer, Allen and
Simpson are as mum as the Democrats
and the bolting Republicans. What can
be expected of a party so demoralized and
divided? How could it possibly adminis
ter the affairs of the country if by any
mischance It came into possession of the
Government? The whole scheme of the
fusionists shows a political imbecility that
is as reckless as it is incompetent. Democ
racy in fact is shooting Niagara, and
nothing can save it from the swift ap
proaching catastrophe.
In 1892 our streets were full of American
jobs looking for men; now our streets are full
of men looking for jobs. When the Wilson
bill was passed the American jobs went across
the water. They will never come back until
there is displayed upon our seacoast the an
nouncement that sound money, protection, re
ciprocity and William McKinley have been
indorsed by the electors of the United States. â
Senator Thurston.
WORDS OF A TRUE AMERICAN.
Undoubtedly Major McKinley is an
American of the highest and truest type.
When called upon the other day by dele
gations from a number of Grand Army
posts he gave them hearty welcome to his
home as comrades in the war days, but in
addressing them he said: "You are here
to-day not as soldiers, but as citizens â
citizens of the best Government in the
world, made better because of the services
you rendered it nearly a third of a century
ago. Coming to this city to give me con
gratulations not only are those who
served on the Union side during that
great struggle, but also the men who
served on the Confederate side. Both
have been here to tender congratulations
and give me assurances of support."
Major McKinley had a splendid oppor
tunity to "ring the changes" and fight
the war all over again. He might have
painted word-pictures of the suffering
they endured and revived the bitter feel
ings of a third of a century ago, but the
lofty patriotism of the man inspired him
to tell the men who stood with tdm in the
heat of battle in defense of the country
that "you are here to-day not as soldiers,
but as citizens," and that men who served
on tbe Confederate side bad been there
"to tender congratulations and give as
surances of support."
Only a truly great man would let such
an opportunity to play upon the events of
history pass unimproved, but Major Mc-
Kinley is seeking tne Presidency of the
whole, not a section of this country, and
be looks upon all Americans as his fellow
citizens. Surely such a man can be
trusted to manage the public affairs of
the people upon l-nes that would better
the conditions of every citizen. It is en
couraging when men who stand for high
office refuse to consider any policy that
does not contemplate a closer union, a bet
ter feeling and general prosperity among
the people.
In the future, as in the past, 1 shall stand
for protection and free coinage. Firmly be
lieving that the best interests of our State and
the Nation at large will be subserved by the
election of McKinley and Hobart, I shall give
them my support, notwithstanding the Na
tional platform does not meet my approval
in one particular.â Senator Carter.
SENATOR WOLCOTT'S LOYALTY.
The Republicanism of Senator Wolcott
has never been questioned, nor has his
loyally to the cause of bimetallism ever
been douDted, and that Is why 10,000 peo
ple turned out to hear him discuss the po
litical issu's of the day at Colorado
Springs. He s-poke in his own State to his
own people, and he talked very plainly to
them. Like very many other advocates of
silver coinage without limit, Senator Wol
cott is satisfied that if silver is ever re
monetized the Republican party will have
to do It. He knows, as does every other
observing man know, that nothing good
has come to the people of the United
States in the past thirty-five years that
was not the direct outcome of Republican
legislation; hence he knows that if the
mints are ever opened to the fiee coinage
of silver the Republican party will open
them. Bat as the Republican party is
pledged to a bimetallic monetary system
there is no risk taken by Senator Wolcott
or any other silver man, and the surprising
thing is that any sensible person could
expect the remonetization of silver through
any party other iban the Republican
party. Silver ironometallism is not bi
metallism, but that is what Bryan's wing
of the Democratic party in advocating.
Senator Wolcott believes that commerce
0
XJtlJfi' SAJN JfKANUISUO CALL, XMUKSMY, SJBIT.KMJtS.EK 17, 1896.
needs a larger volume of redemption
money, and the Republican party believes
so too; but the Republican party knows
very well that theremonetization of silver
would not add a single dollar tv the vol
ume of money employed in current opera
tions unless commerce sanctioned the re
monetization. Hence it is that the Re
publican party proposes to make commerce
a party to an agreement to open the mints
to silver, and hence it is also that Senator
Wolcott and all other sensible students of
the pcience of money are supporting Major
McKinley.
It is very true that the Bryanites are
aiming at the remonetization of silver,
Dut they propose to defy commerce and
the law of trade and arbitrarily legislate
values. That would do very well if laws
could be enacted which would oblige com
merce to accept values that were created
by law, but it so happens that commerce
in the matter of fixing values is & law
unto itself, and it is superior to any nation
or people. It follows, t. en, that if sliver
were remonetized In opposition to the
wish of commerce, commerce would make
a distinction between the money it ap
proved of and tbat which it did not ap
prove of, and very naturally it would carry
that which it did approve to countries
that were in harmony with it, thus leav
ing the nation issuing the other kind of
money upon the basis of that money. To
avoid such a calamity to our home and
foreign trade, Senator Wolcott, a free
silver man, urges the people of his State
to aid the Republican party in its effort to
remonetize silver upon a basis that will
make a silver dollar the equal of a gold
dollar the world over.
Stiver advocates desire that money shall be
cheap and plenty. Let us see what this con
tention leads to. The cheapest money in the
world is found in the strongest gold country â
England. The dearest money is in the free
silver countries. Gold in London can be bor
rowed on good security at 2 per cent per
annwn, while silver in Mexico, China, Chile,
the Argentine Republic, Spain and India
commands a loaning value of 13 per cent. â
Washington Hesfing.
DEMOCRATIC AID.
It looks as though Sewall would have to
walk the plank. Some one must be held
responsible for the Republican victory in
Maine, and Sewall is the logical victim,
but it is wrong to sacrifice him. It was
not his fault; besides, as between Sewall
and Bryan tbe people of Maine would take
the former almost to the man, for he is a
protectionist, and that of itself would com
mend aim to the people of his State as
against any free-trader. If there is need
for a sacrifice Mr. Bryan should be offered
up. His own wild and ill-considered dec
larations was what made Maine Demo
crats vote the Republican ticket. Bryan
has made the issue one of hatred and sec
tionalism, and in defense of public morals
and tbe Nation's honor the true men of
Maine crossed and recrossed party lines
that they might give greater emphasis to
their disapproval of Bryanism.
It is easy to understand the lesson which
tbe Maine election teaches. The people
are not ready to substitute Bryanism for
the principles or Washington, of Jefferson
and of Lincoln, and the voice of Vermont
and the voice of Maine is the voice of an
overwhelming majority of the people
everywhere. Even in Arkansas, it now
transpires, tbe majority for Bryanism was
only about one-half as large as the man
agers of tbe campaign ordered the return
ing boards to make it, which shows that
there is a strong feeling of resentment in
that State against the effort of Bryan to
foist his fallacies upon the Government.
There is a vast deal more tnan a Republi
can victory in Vermont and in Maine, and
in tne cutting down of the Democratic
majority in Arkansas. If Mr. Bryan does
not see in these things an expression of
public sentiment that is condemnatory of
his theories of government, he is blindly
joined to his stupid idols.
If Bryan's managers want to punish
some one for the overwhelming defeat of
their ticket in Maine, let them get after
tho thousands of Democrats who either
refused to vote at all or voted the Repub
lican ticket. J. 11. Manley, Republican
National commit teeman for Maine, says:
"We have been aidea in this great con
test by many Democrats, who have placed
country above party and who believe that
you cannot divide the people into parties
on a question of simple morals and com
mon honesty. They share our victory
with us."

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS,
De Koven and Smith's new Chinese opera,
"The Mandarin," is soon to be produced at the
Herald-square Theater by Messrs. Evans and
Mann. Tne plot deals witn a case of mistaken
identity, a mandarin having to undergo the
humiliation of being mistaken for a common
cooly laborer. The mandarin is punished for
the cooly's misdeeds, while the real laborer,
recognizing a good thine when he sees it,
wears the mandarin's yellow buttons and bat
tens in the lap of luxury. The action of the
piece passes in Peking, and De Koven was very
anxious to introduce some local coior by the
introduction of some real Chinese music. He
went a number of times to the Chinese theater,
jvnd though he did not admire Celestial har
mony v much as Paderewski did, he man
aged at last to pick up a' few tunes and get an
idea of Chinese orchestration. William Mann
says that be and Mt. Evans were not so enthu
siastic about the Chinese music as De Koven
was, but they consented to allow some of it to
be rehearsed for them on a hired piano,
brought to tbe theater for the purpose and
played by a professional accompanist engaged
for the occasion and who is known to his mu
sical friends as "The Hobo ken Rock Crusher."
The piano had stood the wear and tear of a
continuous variety show performance for some
weeks, but one repetition of the Chinese mu
sic caused the treble wires to slacken a quarter
of an inch. It was noticed also, on the authority
of Mr. Mann and Mr. Evans, that the Salvation
Army band, which nightly, at the corner of
Thirty-fifth street and Herald square, drives
terror into the heart of tbe devil to musical
accompaniment, moved down tbe street after
the Chinese rehearsal began. Then De Koven
gave in and the Chinese local color was elimi
nated from the score.
Leoncavallo and Mascagnl are rivals. The
"Cavalieria Rusticana" made Mascagni famous.
Shortly after "I Pagliacci" was given to the
world, and Leoncavallo, in a sense, snatched
some of tbe laurels from Mascagni's brow. Since
then the two young Italian composers have
both been worrying along the road to universal
fame, each, fearing that the other would get
there first. Last season Mascagni made the
tour of Germany and Austria as a conductor
ana created & sensation, which must have
made Leoncavallo feel that his lot was one of
comparative obscurity. The composer of "I
Pagliacci," however, is evidently not to be
outdone by his bated rival, for it is now an
nounced that during the coming season he will
make a tour of the United States to direct
symphony concerts. Fragments of his own
works will also be performed at these concerts.
The route of Leoncavallo's tour Is not yet an
nounced, but the successful young composer
will certainly receive as much lionizing in this
country as Mascagni received last winter in
Germany, for Americans are proverbially in
dulgent to foreign artists, and a composer in
the heyday of his career will be something oi
a novelty. Leoncavallo is said to be a very
gifted conductor.
"Hansel and Gretel" was such an over
whelming success in London that it is inter
esting to learn something of the prims donnas
who first created the title roles in English.
The late Sir Augustus Harris wanted young
singers, but he took care also that they were
endowed with, remarkable talent. Miss Jennie
Douste, who represented Gretel, appeared
before the Queen as a pianist at the early age
of five and a half years. Indeed Miss Douste,
to use her own words, still loves the piano,
and when Signor Tosti suggested a few years
ago that she should become a vocalist, she felt
at first some hesitation about accepting his
MISS JENNIE DOUSTE and MISS MARIE ELBA, Who Created
the Roles of Hansel and Gretel in the First English Version.
advice. At the early age of 8 years Miss
Dousteâ in company with her sister, who is
also a well-known musician â visited the
United States in a professional capacity, and
so enamored were the ladles of Boston of the
sisters' musical talents that they formed a
"Douste" club, which is still a flourishing in
stitution. Miss Marie Elba, who created the
English role of Hansel, is the daughter of a
Danish clergyman. It was her intention to be
a pianist, but the conductor of the Stockholm
opera, after hearing her sing at Copenhagen
when she was in her eighteenth year, induced
her to go to Stockholm to study. This she did,
and after remaining there a year she made her
debut in "Lakme." The young debutante
made such, an impression that she was called
before the cur tain, no less than fifteen times.
Both these young prima donnas contributed
largely to the success of "Hansel and Gretel,"
for though the plot of the opera is simple the
music la intricate. The latest news respecting
the opera is that it is to be produced In Italy
this coming winter. The musical paper,
II Trovatore, sptaking of It says, " 'Hansel
and Gretel' is the best product of musical Ger
many since Wagner left off writing."
A curious piece of news is contained in the
Monde Orphanique: "Anew instrument has
just been introduced into the orchestra of the
Royal Opera at Dresden. It is known as a
'war horn,' and is no other than the horn of
an African antelope, perforated with great
address. Its mouthpiece is of metal, and ex
actly resembles that of a trumpet. Its natural
scale gives five notesâ ot, sol, ut, ml, solâ and
it appears that its sound is much more ma
jestic and penetrating than that of any metal
horn. William 11, in his quality as a musician,
has interested himself very much in the new
instrument and has given orders for its Intro
duction into the army. It is stated at Berlin
that the new war horn will supplant the reg
ulation clarion of the Prussian army. Its
length of nearly a yard and a half will
astonish the soldiers, and those who are of
the Hebrew faith will be able to imagine
themselves in an old synagogue, for it seems
that the antelope's horn very much resembles
the old religious horn of the Israelites (scho
pbar). It Is to be booed that, musically speak
ing, it will give more melodious results." The
parallel between a metal horn and one of real
horn seems rather doubtful from the stand
point of acoustic science. In any case, admit
ting that the projects of William II are well
founded, it will be enrious to see the German
army adopting for its signals the ancient war
horns of the indigenes of Kassai.
In ;a volume which he consecrates to Hans
yon Bulow, the Viennese pianist, Yon Motta,
cites some aphorisms of the great artist: "It is
possible to play correctly and well and yet be
interesting. Do not; try to be so interesting
that yon cease to play well." Of Mozart ho
used to say: "It was not for nothing that Mo
zart was half Italian. People play his music,
not even as if he had been born at Salzbourg,
but as if he had first seen the day at Stock
holm. This is too glacial; too dead. Study
his operas, or play his sonatas for piano or
violin. With Mozart, even in his pianoforte
sonatas, there is always a dramatic ground
work. Each theme by Mozart is an individ
uality."

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
The average hotel proprietor and clerk will
tell you these days that It beats the world how
many loungers there are at the hotels, who do
not stop there, and who are in no way con
nected with tbe hostelries. Many of these peo
ple kindly have their mall come in care of tho
hotels, and it is a good part of the clerk's job
to answer inquiries from these "patrons."
The hotel people call men of this class
"chair boarders," because all they do is to hold
down the choirs at the hotels. Not a few of
them have divers schemes on foot for winning
a useful dollar from the guests.
All the principal hotels have their full
quota of the chair-boarders. There are no ex-
ceptions. For a year or two during the dull
I times the seats at the hotels have been partic
ularly crowded. It may be thought tbat the
gentlemen from tbe outside only linger within
j in profusion during rainy weather, but rain
or shine they are always on hand, and can be
fully depended on.
The other day the manager of one of the
leading hotels, in answer to a request that he
point out somebody who had some news, said
in disgust, as he waved his hand down two
long rows of men who occupied chairs :
"These men you see are all chair-boarders,
ana have drifted in from the street. Just wait
till I count them and you will get an Idea how
It is. On that side are eleven outside men
occupying the entire eleven chairs, and on the
other side the entire eight yon see sitting are
also men who are not registered here. The
guests are forced to stand up in the corridors.
What do you think of that for a hotel for
which you've got to pay a rent of $50,000 a
year?"
But Stephen Brodie, the hero of that great
play, "On the Bowery," got in and asserted
himself yesterday at one of the hotels, to wit,
the Baldwin, and there was in consequence a
scattering such as was extremely gratifying to
the attaches.
"How many of you people ain't got no
homes?" inquired Mr. Brodie, as he got out in
the rotunda and gazed at the long line of self
appointed customers who do not pay.
There was some ducking of heads, and
come shambling pretense at letting other fel
lows reply. Nobody did reply, in fact, hut
gradually the crowd filed away, possibly con
templating the lines,

Tne Oceanic Steamship Company's Aus
tralia arrived from Honolulu yesterday |
with the following passengers:
M. V. Andrews. A. F. Alvarez, Miss Martha
Beckwith. Miss Bolton, Miss Boyer, Hon. H. P.
Baldwin, Dr. W. R. Cochranc and wife, Mrs.
Carroll, Miss Carroll, Miss G. Carroll, Captain
J. C. Cluney, Robert Catton, Captain D'A'i

Whittier, A. B. Wood, F. Weber, E. C. Winston,
A. Youiik. Captain E. Rice, Mrs. C. L. Wight,
Wilder Wight, Captain McPftail, wife and four
children.
Two invalids were among those on
board, and twice did the ambulance make
a voyage to the vessel. On the first occa
sion Mrs. Eleanor Graham was taken
away in a private ambulance. While on
one of the inter-island steamers she made
a misstep and, falling over a chair, in
jured her spine. Physicians at Honolulu
recommended her removal to San Fran
cisco for treatment. Two doctors were at
the steamer to meet the invalid and she
was given the best of care.
Late in the afternoon another ambu
lance put in an appearance on the wharf.
This time it was Boatswain "Tom" Rhodes
who was carried off the steamer. It came j
from the United States Marine Hospital
and a number of tne crew carried the
stretcher on which the injured man lay '
from the ship to the ambulance. There '
was not- the same ceremony as In the case j
of the wealthy cabin passenger, but j
Boatswain Tom was as carefully handled |
as any injured man who ever left a ship.
Chief Officer Lawless looked after all the
details.
The accident to Boatswain Rhodes hap
pened in Honolulu. He was working
around the winch and his right foot got
caught in the machinery, crushing the
ankle. It will be months before he will
be able to be about again.
J. W. Smith, second engineer of the
Australia, was treated to a surprise when j
the vessel reached Honolulu. He found a
bouncing baby eirl two days old and his !
wife well and hearty awaiting him. The
little one is to be christened Ethel Austra
lia.
H. C. Tabrette, marine superintendent of
the Risdon Iron Works, had an experience
last night into which he intends initiating
every frierrd of his on the Pacific. Chief
Engineer Little of the Alameda showed
him last Tuesday nieht the home of the
sliding stairs, the electric button, the easy
chair and the living pictures. By the
time Tabrette and Little had bumped !
down two nights of stairs, had been intro
duced to the electric needle and had the
wall of living pictures fall on them the
former thought it was time to go home.
"Yesterday Tabrette did the water front in
a baggy, but nevertheless insisted that he
\ras well and hearty. He denies emphat
ically that he ate with relish a sandwich
made with soap substituted for cheese.
In spite of the fact that their schooner
has been seized and is now in the hands of
the United States Marshal the South San
Francisco Packing Company yesterday
paid off the hunters and sailors in full. A.
P. Lorentzen, the agent, did not want to
pay the men their money until the case
was decided in the United States courts,
j but President* Nonnenmann thought dif
ferently. Tne Jane Gray took 451 skins off
the Japan coast and 257 in the Bering Sea.
The captain, owners and crew assert that ;
the latter were taken with spear--, but the i
revenue officers say they wera taken with
guns against the law. The men were
nearly all on a "lay," that is, their pay
would be so much on each skin taken.
President Nonnenmann set the value of
all the skins taken at $8 each and much to
their surprise the men were paid on that
valuation. Xearly all the skins have been
shipped to England.
The Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
Yaquina had a narrow escape on her trip
from Puget Sound to Sao Francisco. She
was niue days netting here, and some
anxiety was felt on her account It now
transpires that a leak caused all tne trou
ble. At one time it was thought the Ya
quina was linking, and the boats were
swung out in readiness for lannching.
The men had their belongings packed,
and the steamer was run inshore. After
jettisoning some of the coal cargo the leak
waÂ« overcome, and a fresh start was made
for this port.
The new steamer for the Humboldt Bny |
Steamship Company is rapidly neanng
completion. Bendixsen is rushing the
'work and at the same time makir.g an ex
cellent job of it. 'When launched it is
asserted by experts in Eureka that the
new craft will be one of the handsomest
and best equipped on the coast. She will
be towed to San FranciÂ«co, and her ma
chinery will be put in by the Fulton Iron
Works. She will probably be launched
about the middle of next month, and will
bave her trial trip early in November.
Two schooners put bacK last night and
both reported heavy weather and disaster.
On the 7th mat. the Norman Sunde was
caught in a gale and had her rudder-head
broke. She had to make port again un
der great difficulties. Repairs will be
made and another start for the codfishinc
banks mad*.
On the 16th inst. Captain Holland of the
Ivy lost his life. It happened at 9:30 a.
m. and the schooner was twenty-eight
miles southwest of the Farallon'es. A
strong northwest gale was (lowing and
the fair lead of the main sneet carried
away. Captain Holland was struck by the
sail and went overboard. A heavy sea
was running, but nevertheless a boat was
lowered and search made. No trace of the
master could be found, so Mate McDon
ald hrough t the Ivy back to port. Captain
Holland was well known in nautical cir
cles, having come to this port from Aus
tralia several years ago.
Among the arrivals yesterday were the
Dunflon in ballast from Victoria, B. C,
and the Schiller from Dunkirk. Both
vessels ara chartered to load wheat.

The foundation is of concrete and the

a large-sized lot on the north for a recrea

OLYMPIC DIRECTORS.
Installation of the New Board of Offi
cersâ t xpeniei Will lie Re
duced.
The newly elected directors of the
Olympic Club were installed last evening
in the presence of about one hundred
members.
George E. Newhail. the president-elect,
said that he did not spprove of the propo
sition to assess the members so ttiat the
club could have sufficient money on hand
to delray tne expenses which will be at
tached to several contemplated improve
ments in the building which ars very
necessary.
Mr. Newhail thought that by reducing
the running expenses of the club sufficient
money will soon be on hand to cover
whatever expenses may be incurred in
improving the bathing department, etc.
It is thought that the salaries of the
employes will be reduced and that the
services of the caretaker of the outdoor
grounds will be dispensed with.
Among others who spoke on the past
and future of the club were F. Eaton, the
ex-president; H. B. Russ, H. P.Taylor, 0.
i P. Morse, F. McLennan and Joseph Kelly.
It was stated that Frank Vail, who was
one of the newly elected officers, handed
in his resignation yesterday.
Tne directors appointed several com
mittees last evening while in session.
THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY
Council No. I of the A. P. A.
Has a Celebration of
Organization
Addresses Were Made to a Large
Audience, and There Were Other
Exercises.
The third anniversary of the organiza
tion of Council No. 1 of the American Pro
tective Association was celebrated last
Tuesday evening at Metropolitan Hall,
when a mass-meeting was held. The at
tendance was large.
All over the auditorium the National
flag was displayed. The rostrum was
handsomely and appropriately decorated.
President Washburn of Council No. 1 pre
sided.
"Father Yorke says that the A. P. A.
are all dead," remarked Mr.' Washburn,
"but this gathering does not look much
like it. I wish that Father Yorke were
here to-night to see this assemblage of
American citizens. In three years this
organization, beginning with a small nu
cleus, has grown to a membership of 50,000
members in California and of these 20,000
are in this City. We will prove that we
are very much alive before the election is
over."
The address of the evening was made by
State President B. F. Hudelson. He
called attention to the lact that Council
No. 1 was the first organization of the
order to be formed west of the Rocky
Mountains. Every State and Territory
west of the Rocky Mountains has been or
ganized thoroughly with local councils
during the past three years. The A. P. A.,
he said, was a political body representing
everything that is Dure and right. It
stands for liberty and will some day re
ceive the credit of having saved the
Nation.
After some discussion of recent ad
dresses by Archbistiop Riordan and
Fattier Yorke, President Hudelson spoke
of the attitude of the Catholic church
toward parochial schools, as indicated by
press dispatches from St. Louis. Then he
said:
"Our public schools are the pride of our
Nation, the bulwark of our republic, and
the American Protective Association does
not propose to keep silent on this question.
Our Catholic friends pretend to believe in
the public schools and expect us to believe
that they do because they pay their taxes.
But the truth is they have "to pay their
: taxes to save their pro, erty from being
sold by the Sheriff. The fact that they
believe their own school system is para
mount to ours is sufficient evidence for us
to believe that they would supplant theirs
for ours if they could do so. So we are not
surprised to find their clergy legislating
against our schools.
"The American Protective Association
stands for all that is grand, pure, true,
elevating, enlightening and belptul in
American politics. We do not claim to be
infallible â -the best of us will make mis
takesâbut our organization aims to keep
its ranks free from all contagion. I just
want to aid this: That you will never
settle this great labor problem and the
other questions that are agitating the Na
tion until a law is passed stopping this
indiscriminate immigration that is dealing
deathlike blows to the Nation. The
American Protective Association fir3t
sounded the danger alarm to the Nation
on this question."
Addresses we also made by Major Ryan
I of Ohio. Captain A. X, Spear. H. V. C.
Swain and Mrs. M. A. Richardson, State
president of the Women's American Pro
tective Association. Miss Sybil Campbell,
Miss Boyd, Professor J. C. Darnell of Oak
land and Miss Warner took part in a mis
cellaneous programme of exercises.
Hard On Smokers.
General Weyler's decree stopping the
exportation of tobacco suitable for wrap
pers compelled American cigar manu
facturers to use the dark Havana wrap
pers heretofore discarded. Dark cigars,
as every physician knows, contain as
much as 10 per cent nicotine poison, caus
ing that feeling of nervousness and nausea
paralysis. A smoker using twenty mild
cigars will not, be affected thereby ati much
as if smoking one strone cigar. A mild
cigar â brand, Half-Million (Jlub â is now
on sale in every cigar place. Sold for 10
cents/ It is as fine a cigar as the best
Havana tiller and hand workmanship can
make it; very mild, agreeable and sweet
as a nut. Try the Half-Million Club
cigar. Manufactured by H. C. Nolan & Co.

Suit for Back Alimony.
Julia Scott O'Brien, who wai divorced from
Michael O'Brien in July, 1895, and awarded
$<jO per month alimony and $400 counsel fees,
has sued her ex-husband for $ 1185, claimed to
be due for nnpaid nllmony. O'Brien is alleged
to be the owner of some property at Fifteenth
and Koe streets which stands in the name of
Jnlia Latimer. alias Julia Swansen, ana Mrs.
O'Brien seeks to have the title fo fixed that
she may levy on it to get the money said to be
due.

The Pacific Coast Jockey Clab will begin
its second annual meeting at Ingleside on
the afternoon of October 28, and there is
every indication in the reports received by
Secretary Leake from such turfmen as
Ullman, Schreiber, Rees and Corrigan
that it will be the greatest race meet ever
?een in this State and beyond a question
the biggest winter meeting ever held in
the United States.
Nothing has been spared to make Ingle-
President A. B. Spreckels.
side track an ideal one, not only for rac
ing but for beauty, and it is to-day not
only a perfect garden spot, shaded by
palms and outlined with shrubbery, but it
is beyond doubt the best winter track in
the world.
A picturesque driveway, bordered by
tall and pungent-smelling eucalyptus
trees, leads from tlic Ingleside Inn to the
grand stand and clubhouse, the latter a
structure after the old mission style, with
a Venetian architectural effect.
The simple and powerful arcades of the
ground floor, with its arched openings
and ample abutments, are in a measure
contrasted by the wide and spacious
porches and balconies of the first and sec
ond floors topped in belvedere fashion.
To obtain a picturesque skyline the cen
tral portion of the building rises one story
higher above the belvederes of the east
and west porches and is crowned by a
large projecting cornice. Tne Spanish
tile roof of this central feature adds to
the entire impression of simplicity. The
balconies of the first floor and the large
arched opening of the second floor gives
the composition the Venetian effect and
makes the clubhouse a picturesque object
from any point of view.
The building is located 154 feet west of
the grand stand and is connected with it
by a two-story colonade, which will be
continued west of the clubhouse to form a
connection with the railroad station. The
building has a frontage of 95x'J5 feet. Its
Secretary "W. S. Leake.
foundation is of concrete and the upper
structure of wood, plastered on the out
side on galvanized fron-wira laths to ftive
the building the finish of the old mission
architecture.
The ground floor has storerooms in the
rear and open arcades in f:ont, forming
the passage from the railroad station to
the grand Bland. The main entrance
steps to the building are located on the
southeast corner and connected with the
portccochere, which is elaborately con
structed with large columns and Spanish
tile roof. These steps lead to a fourteen
foot-wide roomy porch, which extends
along the entire south and east fronts,
givine a magnificent view of the entire
track. This porch and the corresponding
one above on the second floor will not be
the least of the club's attractions during
the racing season. The porch is easily
accessible from within by large double
swinging doors from the hall- and lobby.
The general sitting-room has a frontage
ot 34 feet, facing the tract, by 20 feet deep,
all linisbed in wood, with wainscoting,
picture-molding, cornices and large brick
fireplace 9 feet wide, arranged to receive
a large log fire. To the right of the lobby
is a parlor 14 feet square and to the left
the office, 14 by 20 feet, with bay
window and connecting private rooms, all
facing the track, with a magnificent view
of the ocean.
The club bar is 14 by I'L feet, and con
nects with n lobby at the rear, having in
close connection store and serving rooms,
with dumb waiter and service stairs. A
toilet-room is conveniently lecated. All
the room* open into the central hall. A
wide stairway leads to the second story,
which is reserved for ladies. A 14-foot
wide porch along the entire south and
east front corresponds with the porch
below, being accessible from halls and
parlor, which ircnts on the track and is
34 by 'JO feet deep, well finished, with
large fireplace, to form a cheerful retreat
for the ladies. *
One dining-room is connected to the
right and two to the left of the parlor.
All rooms are supplied with ample win
dow space and bay-windows, giving a fine
view of the track and the ocean.
A spacious hall is located in the center
of the second door, and all rooms open
into same, with kitchen, serving-rooms,
serving-stairs, ladies' waiting and toilet
rooms in connection.
Great pains have been taken to prepare
the plans of this clubhouse, in particular
the arrangement of the rooms in regard
to the club's needs, which have been most
carefully attended to. All the latest
ideas and improvements will be applied
to the structure, making the clubhouse
one of the finest in the country.
The crand stand, betting-ring, paddock
and stables were modeled after the latest
design, and were built with a view of se
curing comfort, convenience and safety.
A perfect and unobstructed view of the
races can be had from any part of the
club's buildings and grounds.
The inside track has been specially pre
pared to accommodate those wishing to
view the races from tally-hos, carriages
and family vehicles.
Of the many approaches to the club's
grounds, one of the most popular is
through the world-famed Golden Gate
Park to the beac'i, thence down the ocean
boulevard to romantic Ingleside. For
natural beauty, variety, comfort and
pleasure this drive is unsurpassed in
America. The old Corbett and Alms
house roads have been thoroughly re
paired and are now most enjoyable drive
wivvs.
During the racing season three regular
trains will be run daily from the Southern
Pacific depot at Third and Townsend
streets direct to the clubhouse and grand
stand, returning at intervals of ten
minutes after the last race. This is a
quick and comfortable ride and is very
desirable, especially during stormy
weather. Tlie roadbed of the liission
streei electric-car line has been thoroughly
ballasted,- additional electric power added,
the transfer privileges extended, and dur
ing the afternoons of the racing season
throuch cars will be run direct to the
track at intervals of only three minutes.
three beautiful driveways, three
regular steam trains and electric-cars ruu
ninti every three minuted, no one should
rind fault with the facilities for going to
and from Inaieside.
In establishing this magnificent race
course at Ingleside the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club has expended in the purchase
of real estate, the erection of builoings,
improvements, wages, etc., the sum of
$540,375 85.
The grounds were firÂ«t opened to the
public on November 29, 1895, and during
the season of 1895-96 the association cave
ninety-six days' racing. It paid in stakes
and purses to the horsemen $261,805 50,
making a total expenditure of $802,181 35,
all of which was disbursed within tue
City and County of San Francisco.
This State and the horsemen of the
United States are indebted for this garden
spot racetrack to a small coterie of men
who love good, square racing. They
organized the Pacific Coast Jockey Club
and with their private means they built
the track. The association is presided
over by A. B. Spreckels, and \V. 6. Leake,
ex-Postmaster of Sacramento, is secretary.
WILL BUILD INTO FRESNO
Construction Work on the Valley
Road Ordered to Bs
Resumed
The Lioe Will Now Bs Rushed to That
Pomt â Passenger Business to
Begin on the First.
Orders have been issued by Chief Engi
neer Storey of the San Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley Railway Company to com
plete the road into the city of Fresno.
Operations were stopped about half a
mile north of Fresno owing to the obstruc
tionist tactics of a number of property
owners along the street through which the
line is to be built. They claimed their
holdings would be damaged by the con
tigmty of the railroad. Most of these
claims have now been adjusted, and but
three or four are in an unsettled condition.
But despite this it has been determined to
now complete the road into Fresno with
the utmost dispatch.
A Inrze force will be put at work to-day
and grading and track-laying will proceed
almost simultaneously. About a week will
be required to get things, into shape to
begin business into Fresno.'
At present the road is in operation only
as far as Patterson, about eighteen milts
north of Fresno. Freight will probably
begin to move into and out of Fresno by
the 25th inst and passenger traffic by the
Ist of October.
POSTPONED FIGHTS.
The Occidental and Armory Clubs Have
Made the Changes.
The Occidental Athletic Club managers
held a conference yesterday with the man
agers of the Armory Club, which resulted
in a change of the dates on which their
respective entertainments were to be held.
"ioung Mitchell, in behalf of the Occi
dental Club, asked for the change owing
to the fact that Tom Tracey, wno was
booked to fight George Green on the last
day of this month, is not feeling well, and
bis medical adviser stated that Tracey
cannot possibly he in condition for a
hard contest with Green unless he has at
least three weeks in which to train prop
erh\
The result of the conference is that the
Occidental Club has postponed its enter
tainment until the evening of October 9,
and the Armory Club exhibition of fisti
cuffs will take place about the middle of
October.

THE OLDEST MAN
ON MISSION ROAD
Views With Delight the
Lighting Up of St.
Mary's College.
UNIQUE CHURCH FAIR.
A Charity Entertainment for
the Benefit of a Worthy
Parish.
REV. P. D. BRADY'S FLOCK
Japanese Lanterns Strung in Fes
toons in a Grove of Trees
Light Up the Way.
John Resing is the oldest man, as well
as the oldest resident, on the Mission road.
He wants this to be distinctly understood,
and, as he stands on the porch of his home
and waves his arm as though outlining
the horizon, he says:
"There was nothing out here when I
built this home more than thirty-nine
years ago, and I have lived here ever
since."
Old man Resing is one of the early ar
rivals in this City. He reached here
aboard the steamer Panama on April 4,
1851, and his judgment of a good loca
tion for a home, founded after a half
dozen years' study, was the very site in
which he now lives.
"This reminds me of olden times," he
chuckled last evening, looking out and
over the grand scene before him. "There
is old St. Mary's College and its beautiful
grounds. When I came here it wasn't yet
built and the trees were not yet planted.
Look at it now. Isn't that beau til ul?"
As a matter of fact the scene was pos
itively lovely and inspiring. The old col
lege towered high above the pines and
eucalyptui trees far in the background.
The grove to be traversed before reaching
it was illuminated by thousands of Jap
anese lanterns strung in festoons, and in
light and airy costumes befitting -the
balmy atmosphere of the warm belt hun
dreds of young and pretty girls with at
tentive cavaliers promenaded, laughed,
chatted and generally made merry before
entering the portals of the old edifice,
where was being held the bazaar for the
benefit of the old St. Mary's parish.
Tne bazar opened last night and will
continue in vogue until tne night of
the 26th.
Father Peter D. Brady, who has gath
ered about him tne loveliest buds of his
parochial garden, has iniused into them
much of his bright nature and they have
managed to turn the somber hall of the
old college into a veritable poem of color
and bunting.
It is no wonder that old man Resing
stood back and chuckled with glee as he
gazed upon the merry scene before him.
"I remember," said he, "the day that
the closing exercises were held over there.
It was after the first six months the col
lege was running. There were 330 pupils
in attendance at the time and every
single one of them had a whole family
wishing to be present. There were no
streetcars then. Those who came here
had to either tramp over the sand dunes
from the City, come out horseback or in
wagons. This section was packed like
the main street of a mining camp, and I
remember well how everybody was
hungry.
"1 just swept the shavings out of my
house and laid out tables covered with
sandwiches for everybody to feait. Well,
they feasted, that's all I can say, and I
had to go without iiam and bread until
the old lady could bake again and buy
some more ham.- This crowd reminds me
of those old days of nearly forty years ago,
only the girls are prettier, the lads are
better dressed and they do not appear to
be so hungry."
"Come in off that porch John, you're
talking morns good lor you," came from
the inside where a dear old lady sat knit
ting beside ber lamp. John subsided.
tour decades ago Archbishop Alemany,
Father Gray and Father Brennan of the
old Mission Dolores church got money
enough together to build St. Mary's Col
lege. Father Gray wai president of the
institution for eight years, and was suc

Brothers took charge twenty-four years

FOR SHOOTING AT
LUCKY BALDWIN
Emma Ashley Placed on
Trial Before Judge
Bahrs.
JURORS DISLIKE THE JOB
Expected Something of the Kind
Would Happen to
Baldwin.
THE HOLE IN THE WALL.
The Defendant Wears a Jaunty Ap
pearance, but Looks Extremely
Unhappy.
Emma A. Ashley, a distrautrht, dazed
and very unhappy looking young woman,

MISS LILLIAN ASHLEY, Who Is MISS EMMA ASHLEY, the Defendant, Who GENERAL FRIEDRICHS, the
Suing v Lucky " Baldwin. Took a Shot at the Millionaire. Defendant's Attorney.
ing on trial for having attempted to kill
Lucky Baldwin in Judge Slack's court
room in the closing days of the trial of her
sister's case against Baldwin.
Lillian Ashley, the plaintiff in the other
ca*e, sat with her. Both sisters have
spruced up considerably since their ap
pearance in the Police Court. The o!d
white straw hat has been discarded, and
in its place sits a rather tasty bit of mil
linery, characterized by a bright flower
and sprightly feather. Both were dressed
in the customary black, and Emma wore
a bunch of yellow marguerites at her
breast.
Emma sat through the day's proceed
ing with the dazed uninterested expres
sion that has characterized her since the
shooting. Only once the sisters spoke to
each other, and that was while the jurors
were examining the bullet which went so
close to its mark, and was afterward due
out of the plaster in the wail back of the
court reporter's table. Then they whis
pered a few words and E;nnia smiled.
Some difficulty had been experienced In
securing a jury, only nine men havinÂ»
been secured as a result of Tuesday's
effort. The talesmen instead of being
found to be prejudiced against the de
fendant were objectionable to the prose
cution because cf a leaning the other
way. Some of them said they could not
but feel a sympathy for a woman in such
a case, and others always "expected some
thing of the kind would happen to Bald
win.
The jurors finally impaneled were: A
8. Perley, N. Davidson. J. G. Burke L
Krugen, D. Curry, D. W. Pringle, L. Q.
Flanaean, W. L. Groat C. Meier, J. M.
Willard, R. Rosenberg, M. Gately.
Assistant District Attorney Peixotto
conducted the case for the people and
General Robert A. Friedrichs defended the
accused. The jury by order of the court
went to Judge Siack's courtroom, the
scene of the shootine, and inspected the
hole in the wall where the bullet lodged,
and which has been carefully pasted over
with a piece of paper since trie incident
Judge Slack afterward took the witness
stand and told the story as he saw it and
substantially as he told it in the Police
Court. He said he thought the deJendant
was not of sound mind at the time of the
shooting.
A. T. Barnett, an attorney, was in Judge
Slack s court room at the time of the
shooting. He stood near the clerk's desk
and saw Miss Emma Ashiey sitting near
her sister at the counsel table. He saw
her rise and take a seat, on the bench out
side the railing, and afterward move again
to a chair near the railing and within a
few feet of Baldwin, She sat there some
few minutes and then rose to her feet
drew a revolver, and fired it toward Bald
win. She had great difficulty in rinne the
revolver, and had to apply both her hands
to it.
H. A. Unrnh, Baldwin's business mana
ger, told the story over again of how he was
attracted to the young lady by the firing
of the pistol and how he sprang up and
wrested the gun from her hands. Having
taken the revolver he allowed her to go
and did not notice her again until she
was in hysterics in the other end of the
room.
James R. McElroy, clerk in Judge
black s court, corroborated Judge Slack
Charles A. Lee, a reporter of the Report
interviewed the defendant in jail immedi
ately after her being booked there and
.ounii her apparently quite calm. She
said to him that it was God's will that she
had not succeeded in her attempt.
Other witnesses gave corroborative tes
timony identical with that given in the
Police Court. Mr. Hie h ton is the only re
maining witness to be produced by the
prosecution, and as he was absent the
case went over until to-morrow morning.
ARRESTED ON BOARD.
Two Santa Monicans Arrested on the
Steamer Santa Rosa in This Port
for Burglary.
Ernest Barada and Bessie Brunson, who
arrived on the Santa Rosa from Santa
Monica yesterday, were promptly arrested
on a wired dispatch from Sheriff Dexter
of the southern town, the charge being
burglary.
SANTA MONICA, Cal., Sept 1&-On
Sunday last the residence of Charles
Fanetti was robbed here of $60 and two
gold watches and chains and two revolvers,
while his wife was absent for a few
moment. Ernest Barada, a barkeeper at
the Arcadia Hotel, who roomed there, but
left on the Santa Rosa on Monday morn
ing early with Bessie Brunson, a woman
of the town, was suspected, but the officers
failed to search him at the time, ana he
was allowed to ieave without search. The
police officials have been at work on the
case and claim to have conclusive evidence
of Barada's guilt, and in consequence
telegraphed to the San Francisco officials
to arrest them on their arrival. Barada
has a number of friends here who refuse
to believe him guilty.
GLAD TO GET HOME.
Young Charles Krausgrill Fasts Three
Days and at Last Gains Hig Point.
Secretary Welch of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, re
cently saw fit to place Charles Krausgrill,
a boy of 11 years, in the Rev. Mr. Car
man's training home. The boy missed
his mother, who keeps a bakery at 1322
Stockton street. In order that he might
return to her the lad refused to eat any of
the food provided for him by Messrs.
Welch and Carman. When he had kept
his self-imposed fast for three days his
condition became alarming. He wis re
turned to his mother, and has now been
with her some days, it is thought his
brief sojourn in , Mr. Carman's establish
ment will make him "toe the mark" for
th.- future.
AN IMPORTANT OPINION,
Judge Sanderson Says ths Fee
Bill of 1866 Is Repealed
by That of 1895.
Five Per Cent of a Judgment May No
Lrnger Be Charged in a
Cost Bill.
Judge Sanderson yesterday handed
down an opinion of great importance. He
says that the fee bill of 1866 has been re
pealed by the passage of the fee Dill of
1895.
The matter came up in the suit of James
K. Lynch vs. F. W. Kreling, et ai. The
plaintiff included in his cost bill 5 per cent
of a $2000 judgment rendered on a note,
claiming that be was auihorized to do so
under the fee bill of 1866, which was a
special legislative act, applicable only to
the City of San Francisco.
The defendant moved to strike out that
portion of the cost bill which included the
percentage, and Judge Sanderson granted
the motion, basing his action on the re
cent decision of the Supreme dourt in the
case of Miller vs. Curry, which is in effect
that the fee bill of 1895 is applicable to
this City.
His Honor holds that the fee bill of 1895
repeals the fee bill of 1866, including the
allowance of percentage on judgments to
be charged as costs. In his opinion he
says :
This percentage charge is in no sense either
a disbursement made or an expense incurred
by the plaintiff, but plainly and simply a pen
alty placed on any losing defendant who may
have the temerity to defend or litigate an ac
tion brought against him. I have always
thoueht it a most unjust and unreasonable
burden to impose as "costs" (to which it bears
no resemblance) on a party to an action, and
it is there :ore with no small degree of satisfac
tion that I find myself able to hold that the
obnoxous piece of legislation has been elimi
nated from the statutes.

WINTHROP IS
FOUND GUILTY
End of the Trial of Banker
Campbell's Shrewd
Assailant.
THE CLOSING ARGUMENT
It Required but Five Minutes
for the Jury to Render a
Decision.
SCENES IN THE COURTROOM
The Prisoner's Wife Seriously Alarms
Mrs. Duntcn by Trying to
Follow Her.
Winthrop is guilty. E. L. Cutten, fore
man of the jury which tried him, so de
cided yesterday. "So say we all," echoed
the eleven other talesmen, and so ended
the most famous local criminal case oi
the year. It took the jury but five min
utes to decide the fat* of the man of
whom Banker James Campbell of Hono
lulu tells one of the strangest stories ever
related in a court of law.
From the first the conviction of the de
fendant was almost a foregone conclusion.
In addition to the efforta of the prosecu
tion Winthrop by his own actions contrib
uted to the verdict. The animosity which
he showed against Captain Lees and his
officers tended to redouble their efforts to
send him across the bay. Attorney Frank
Bell and his coadjutor did the best they
could for him, but they devoted their ef
forts almost entirely to an alibi, which
proved to have no foundation, and abso
lutely failed to disprove any of the allega
tions of the peopk-.
Yesterday's proceedings began with
Assistant District Attorney Black's reply
to the arguments of Winthrop's counsel.
There was a large crowd in attendance,
all seemingly anxious to be in at the
death. Winthrop s wife and mother-in
law occupied seats in the courtroom until
Mr. Black began his remarks, when Mrs.
Winthrop hurriedly quitted the apart
ment. She has borne up bravely and has
sought throughout to lend the comfort
and support of her presence to her hus
band; but when the Assistant District At
torney rose to say all the ill things that
the prosecution had to say oi her hus
band she could stand it no longer, and so
withdrew.
Mr. Black's remarks held everybody's
close attention. He combatted and ex
plained away almost every point made
by Bell against the statements of Camp
bell. He alleged that the defense bad
itseif added corroborative evidence to the
stories of Campbell's witnesses. They
a?â¢ KeenX een Winthrop near the cottage at
4109 California street at times when Camp
bell did not know he was there.
With regard to the alibi Winthrop
sought to establish, Mr. Black said that
he had evidently made himself conspicu
ous at the meetings in question, in order
to establish that alibi in case he should
be arrested.
As to Urquhart, the speaker contended
that Bell would "put hia foot in it" should
he undertake to prove that he had served
time in Canada. Bell, however, conten.ls
that he is right, and that he will yet have
Lrqutart placed behind the bars for
perjury for denying it. "Urquhart's ac
tions," said Mr. Black, "were all those
of an innocent man. When he learned of
Campbell's disappearance, he reported to
the police what he knew of it. Winthrop,
on the contrary, ran away. If Urquhart
is guilty, as Winthrop claims, why did not
v\ inthrop come to the police as did the
man he accused and tell what he knew?
Instead he used every endeavor to de
ceive the police, opened up a decoy cor
respondence with his wife, under an as
sumed name, and when confronted by
Detective Cody in Oakland was disguised
and had the stolen money concealed about
?il m .", Wnen cornered he remarked,
well, Cody, the jig is up.' The only
conclusion to draw from such evidence
is one of .uuilt.
'A number of witnesses were called to
testify as to Winthrop's reputation. Some
of them knew him only from personal
dealings with him, and others had not
heard his reputation discussed until alter
the death of Mrs. Matthews. Tne de
fense," said the attorney, "utterly failed
to establish a good reputation for tbe ac
cused and, even if it bad, it would have been
immaterial, as many men who have up to
a certain time borne an unblemished repu
tation have been found to be criminals.
Mr. Black closed by asking the jury not
to be swerved from duty Ity sympathy for
the prisoner's wife and family. They were
under oath, he said, to find only on the
evidence without reference to its effect on
any one. He asked for a verdict of guilty.
Judge Wallace then charged tne jury.
His charge was fair and impartial and
comparatively brief. He instructed the
jurymen upon the legal points in the case
and was particularly careful to declare that
they alone were judges of the facts, with
which they might deal as they pleased.
He said they were to determine whether
WinthroD took the money from the per
son of Campbell against his will and that
they must presume him innocent unless
the evidence should overcome that pre
sumption. He also went into tbe evi
dence that had been presented to show a
good character for the defendant and said
that if that had been proven it should be
taken in his favor, but that it was not
enough to weigh against positive evidence
of guilt
At 11:35 o'clock the jury retired, and
the spectators had hardly settled down in
their seats before the bell rang announc
ing their return.
xhe short time occupied in deliberation
augured ill for Winthrop. He straight
ened up in his chair, clenched his teeth
tiehtly, and his countenance assumed that
hard, set look which one might expect a
determined man to wear as he faced death.
Mrs. Winthrop, who had in the meantime
resumed her place at his side, again felt
that she could not stand the ordeal, and
retired to the corridor. Mrs. Brooks, the
defendant's mother-in-law, sobbed audi
bly, while the two little boys crouched
close to their father's side.
"Gentlemen, have you agreed upon a
verdict?" asked Judge Wallace.
"We iiave," replied Foreman Gotten.
"What is your verdict?"
"We find the defendant, Oliver W. Win
throp, guilty of robbery as charged."
Winthrop never moved a muscle, but
turned to Attorney Bell, who asked that
the jury be polled. The operation was
gone through with, each of the jurymen
responding that the verdict announced by
Mr. Cutten was his.
Bell then asked for time in which to
prepare a motion for a new trial, but
Judge Wallace refused to allow him
longer than until next Monday morning
at 10 o'clock, when the ex-custodian of
Laurel Hill Cemetery was ordered to ap
pear for sentence. His Honor remarked,
however, that if it was then found neces
sary to grant more time it would probably
be allowed.
Winthrop wax handcuffed to the Deputy
Sheriff, after kissing his children, and
taken into the jury-room, where his wife
awaited him. After bidding her good
by i.c was taken to the Black Maria,
which conveyed him to the County Jail.
Immediately after leaving her husband
Mrs. Winthrop saw Mrs. Dunton in the
corridor. Mrs. Dunton harried from the
building, with Mrs. Winthrop following
close in her wake. Mrs. Dunton became
much alarmed and returned to police
headquarters and reported the matter to
Chief Crowley, who detailed a policeman
to accompany her to her borne.

TIRED TO BURN
A BIG SALOON
A Bold Attempt to Commit
Arson on Bush
Street.
COAL OIL WAS USED.
The Stuff Spread All Over the
Furniture, Walls and
Carpets.
COVERED BT LARGE INSURANCE
How M. C. Wenceslow, the Proprie
tor, Took Out Policies Under
Two Different Names.
Between 2 and 6o'clock*yesterday morn
ing an attempt was made to burn out the
saloon at 311 Bush street, near Montgom
ery. It will be remembered that years
ago this place was the headquarters of
Christopher Buckley, and many a man
entered the front door and departed from
the back door that opens on the little
alley, made or marred for life. For sev
eral months it was unoccupied, but last
June it was rented by M. C. Winslow,
who reopened the old well-known jaloon.
From ail accounts W r inslow's venture
was not a great success, and on the 14th
the Sheriff took charge of the business
upon an attachment in favor of D. E.
Besecker, who wanted payment on a 57650
butcher bill. It was stated that another
of Winslow's creditors was about to levy
another attachment for $300. To state the
case briefly Winslow was anything but
prosperous, and the financial clouds
seemed to be gathering fast on his hori
zon.
Fire Marshal Charles Towe yesterday re
ceivea word that an attempt had been
made to burn the saloon during the night
and he at once made an investigation, and
the evidence be obtained led him to be
lieve that he knew who the man was who
committed the deed. The plan was evi
dently well laid, but, like many of a sim
ilar nature, it miscarried because the per
petrator was ignorant of a few natural
Jaws. Coal oil had been poured all over
the floor, walls and portieres that divide
the small card rooms in the rear. The
match bad been applied, and the flames
spread up the wall and consumed the cur
tains and then went out.
The reason for this was the fellow who
applied the match did not want the first
burst ol flames to be seen from the street,
and he closed the doors to the main saloon
and the fire died out for want of fresh air
and a draught. Had the pian been a suc
cess the office of the Breeder and Sports
man paper and a jewelry manufactory in
the second and third stories would have
been destroyed or badly damaged.
Dan Fallon, the night barkeeper, left
the saloon safe and securely locked at 2
o'clocE in the morning, and at 6 o'clock
Fred Schenkel, the day barkeeper, entered
the place and made the discovery. None
of the doors hart been forced or broken,
and the only other person who had a key
to the premises was Winsiow, the pro
prietor.
Later in the day a telephone message
was received from Winslow, who said he
was in San Jose. Fire Marshal Towe
looked over tie premises and decided
that there was not over $500 or $800 worth
of stock and fixtures in the place. He
further found that the saloon was run un
der the names of J. S. and M. C. Winslow,
ilthough who J. S. Winslow is was a mys
tery. Another peculiarity that the Fire
Marshal learned was that since June Win
slow had taken ont two fire insurance
policies, one for $1000 in the name of M.
C. Winslow, and the other for $2500 in an
other company in the name of M. C. Wen
ceslow. An insurance of $3500 on $500
worth of property, taken out in two poli
cies and in two names, caused a grave
suspicion in the mind of the Fire Marshal,
and he asked the Deputy Sheriff in charge
of the saloon to inform him as soon as the
proprietor of the place put in an appear
ance.
Late in the afternoon Winslow went to
the saloon and Mr. Towe was telephoned
for. He questioned Winslow for nearly
an hour. The latter said that on Tuesday
afternoon be went to Hay wards to see a
friend about raising money to pay off the
claims standing against him, and from
Hay wards he went to San Jose in a buggy
and was there at the time of the fire.
He said that the difference in the names
in the two insurance policies was a mis
take of the agent, and that while his true
name is Wenceslow he is often called
Winslow and sosiens himself occasionally.
He stated that J. S. Winslow or Wences
low is his brother, who is now residing in
Guadalupe.
Fire Marshal Towe is anything but sat
isfied with his investigation and his inter
view with Winslow or Wenceslow. The
latter was directed to call at the office of
Mr. Towe this afternoon, when a more
searching inquiry will" be made. He- for
merly lived in Oakland, so he said, and at
present he lives with his wife on Powell
street, near Sacramento.
TAX COMMISSIONS.
The County of Sacramento Loses In Its
Battle With State Controller Colgan.
The Supreme Court has affirmed the de
cision of the lower tribunal in the case of
the County of Sacramento against State
Controller E. P. Colgan. The action was
in mandate, it being sought to compel the
Controller, in his next settlement with the
Sacramento County Treasurer, to allow
the Treasurer to retain $32,660 10 claimed
to be due the county as State tax commis
sions. The Superior Court found ad
versely to the plaintiff.
In affirming the decision the Supreme
Court reviews at length the statutes gov
erning tax commissions charged by coun
ties upon State taxes. By the act of 1870
the county was allowed as commission on
all but school taxes 6 per cent on ttie first
$10,000, 4 per cent on all over $10 000 and
under $20,000, and 2 per cent on all over
the last-named sum.
The act of 1874 allows the county 1 per
cent on all taxes. The sole question was
whether the act of 1870 or that of 1874
should govern the award of commissions
to the county. The lower court held that
the first act was repealed by the second a
ruling which the Supreme Court upheld

flames.
The total loss of the firm was about
$45,003, covered by |35,000 insurance. Sev
eral outbuildings belonging to the Sailors'
Home were also destroyed and damaged
to about $1600. The coal bunkers of the
Bryant Coal Company and the Central
Coal Company were also damaged to about
$1000. and a small building belonging to
Wain wright & Easton was injured to about
$300.
Shortly after 10 o'clock Tuesday even
ing Watchman Ross discovered a email
blaze in the ceiling of the engine-room,
near the smokestacK. He made an effort
to put out the fire, but it was too much for
him, as he was old and feeble, having
passed nis eighty-third birthday.
The old man ran throuch the bniJdin?
and yard and Bent in a still alarm to UJn
gine Company 9, across the way on Main
street. The firemen soon had the fire put
out, and they went away.
A few minutes after 4 o'clock yesterday
morning they were again called owt by the
aged watchman, who said that the build- j
ing was on fire again. By the time they j
reached the street the big box factory was
in a blaze, tbe flames bursting out oi the
roof. A special police officer !ad also seen
the fire and sounded an alarm from box
5L Two lines of hose were quickly run
into the premises, one from Main and one
from Spear street.
The firemen who entered the Main
gtreet entrance were driven back by the
heat, and as they were retreating they
saw the old watchman plunge into the
dense smoke as though going to the Spear
street entrance through the principal pas
sageway.
The smoke closed aronnd him and no
one saw him after that. Blinded and con
iused by the smoke and flames old Cap- |
tain Ross perished miserably, and tons of
machinery, lumber and debris buried him
deep in the ruins.
Thus ended his service for the company
which bÂ»gan a quarter of a century ago.
Captain Ross was iormerly connected with
the Mare Island Navy-yard. He lived at
Golden Gate, near Berkeley, and leaves an
aged widow. He was always a faitnful
and conscientious employe. Up to last
evening his remains were not recovered.
As soon aÂ» Cnief Engineer Sullivan
reached the scene he caused a third alarm
to be sounded, which can be done by the
new system and thus save the time usu
ally lost in making a second call. In a
very short time engines, hosecarts, hook
and ladder trucks, water tower and
Siamese stands were on the ground by the
dozen and huge volumes of water were
being poured into the flames. Captain
Comstock of tne Fire Patrol and his men
lost no time in saving movable property.
It was a most peculiar fire to ti^bÂ«, for the
force of the streams scattered the blazing
lumber, box material, etc., and threw
them high into the air, and these failing
upon the surrounding roofs threatened to
set tire io the whole district. Clouds of
smoke and flames carrying burning wood,
burst into the air to a height of seventy
live feet above the factory roof.
There was nothing to do but to ccc that I
the fire did not spread, and it was not uu- j
til about 6 o'clock that it was fully under
control. In the meantime the sheds and
stables of the Bailors' Home were de
stroyed, and the ends of half a dozen coai-
Dunkers burnt out.
The main factory, a two-story structure,
was 127:6x150 feet in size, and it was tilled
with valuable machinery and a more val
uable stock. The remainder of the two
50-vara Jots was covered with thousands
of feet of lumber under a shed, and a large
stable full of hay. The hay was destroyed,
but the horses were saved.
Nearly 100 men and boys have been
temporarily thrown out of work by the
tire. The Hobbs- Wall Company at once
opened an office at 316 Steuart street and
said that it was ready for business. Ail
but one of the otber dox factories in this
City sent word to the unfortunate firm
proffering assistance in rilling orders.
Hobbs, Wall & Co., the heaviest losers,
were well in-ured, carrying $35,000 policies
in about two dozen insurance companies.
They took out a large number of policies
during t .c last rate war among tbe in
surance companies, and they are uot sorry
for it.
The cause of the fire will probably never
be known. Fire Marshal Towe's theory
is that a large quantity of soot collected
in the smokestack and caught on fire
at a time when there was no draught to
carry the heat up and out. This intense
heat started the two fires by the contact
of the smokestaclc with the dry floor of
the second story.
Captain Comstock's estimate of the loss
and damages was as follows:
Hobbs, Wall & Co., box factory, yards,
sheds and stable for storage of lumber;
buildintr and plant. Total loss, estimated
at $4? .000.
Coal-bunkers, office and stable of Bryant
Coal Company. Central Coal Company;
buildings scorched.' Estimated loss, $100.
Two-story frame tmilding, owned and
occupied by Wain wright & Easton; wood
and coal. Estimaied Joss, $300
Rear Sailors' Home; buildings owned
by United States Government. Estimated
lo"ss, $200.
TOYING TO SAVE WORDEN.
His Erother, a Missionary of
Japan, Is Here in His
Interest.
He Will Try to Get Governor Budd
to Ccmnju c tbe S ntence to
Life Imprisonment.
The Rev. Whiting S. Worden, M.D., a
missionary of Yokohama, and brother of
S. D. Worden. the convicted train-wrecker,
is at the Occidental Hotel, He bas come
over from Japan to do all he can to Ret his
brother's sentence commuted to life im
prisonment, and is now circulating a peti
tion asking Governor Budd for clemency.
"My brother must have been insane,"
said Dr. Worden yesterday; "it could rot
have been any other way. He was always
very quiet and peaceable. He drantc,
however, and when he drank it sometimes
made him wild.
"We do not hope for a new trial now.
The case was appealed, and we tried to
reopen the case in the Supreme Court, but
couldn't do it. It is settled now, and all
I can do is to appeal to Governor Budd.
He can save him if he will.
"It looks hard that the same evidence
that acquitted all the others 6houid con
vict him. My brotber came to the Pacific
Coast from New York in 1869. He used to
be a messenger for Wells, Fargo & Co.,
and he was presnnt at the driving of the
gold spike when the Central and Union
Pacific roads were connected. His father
was one of the most respected physicinns
of Syracuse, where he practiced medicine
for forty-nine years. Our grandfather on
mother's side was a graduate of Harvard
and also a physician for many years in
Massachusetts. My brother should have
been one of the leading men here.
"He is to be resentenced next Tuesday
at Woodland. Ido not know when I shall
go back to Japan. I came as soon as I
could â as soon aa I got the news that the
case could not be reopened. I cannot be
lieve that the ueople who are influential
will be bloodthirsty, and 1 hope they will
all aid me in trying to gain a commutation
of the sentence."
Ttie Rev. Mr. Worden came over in the
ahip Monmouthshire, reaching Portland
in iourteen days from Yokohama. Thence
be came direct here.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1896.
INTOXICATED IN
THE SHERIFF'S CARE
Deputy Appel's Prisoner
Gets Drunk and Tells
% a Story.
IS TO BE INVESTIGATED
Hannah Landridge Pleaded
Guilty in Court to Grand
Larceny.
AN OLD SCANDAL REVIVED.
She Now Declares She Gave Part of
tbe Stolen Money to Police
man Rourke.
There was something like a sensation
among the officials in the City Prison
yesterday when Hannah L%ndbridtre,
alias "Fat Annie," appeared in a btate of
intoxication, accompanied by Deputy
Sheriff Appel.
The woman, who is well known in the
dives on the Barbary Coast, was brought
from the brancn County Jail yesterday
morning to Judge Belcher's court to stand
her trial on a charge of grand larceny.
She was arrested on April 13 by Police
man Norman, charged with stealing $390
from Felix Bush, a farmer from Van
couver, B. C, who was here on his way to
South America. He met the woman ie a
dive on Friday night, April 17. and went
with her to her room, where lie was
robbed.
After her arrest there was a scandal, in
volving Policeman Thomas Rourke and
Special Officer John Mclntyre. It was
alleged on the authority of Newton L.
Valencia, a messenger-boy, that the
.woman, who had sent for him previous to
and after her arrest to take messages to
Rnurke, had told him that she had given
$200 to a friend to employ an attorney t o
deiend ber, and the balance, $190, to
Rourke and Mclntyre, and she wanted to
Â»<se Rourke to get her share.
The boy did not find Rourke till early
Monday morning, April 20, and he at once
took him before Cuief Crowlev. Ihe
matter was fully investigated, but as the
woman denied having ever given Rourke
or Mclntyre any money it wa3 allowed to
drop.
Yesterday morning when Hannah ap
peared in court she pleaded guilty aiid
she was ordered to appear for sentence on
Saturday. That was about. ll o'clock.
Two hours later Deputy Sheriff Appel ap
peared with her at the City PnÂ»on and
she was heJplessiy drunk and almost dis
robed. No explanation was offered by tbe
deputy and Hannah was put on a bed in
the matrons room. After she had about
two Hours' sleep she became so uproarious
that several "trusties" carried her into
the woman's cell. She was kicking and
screaming all the way and her language
was far from choice.
She regretted having pleaded guilty.
She said she was advised to do It^when
she Â«ot into court, on the promise that
she would get a light sentence. Her auger
blazed out against Policeman Rourke and
she charged him with, as she expressed it,
"turning her down." She declared that
when she told Chief Crowley in April that
she had never given Rourke the $190 she
deliberately lied to save him. She told a
circumstantial story to Mrs. French and
others showing when and where she had
parted with the money, and said she
would have told it in court if she had not
been advised to plead guilty. She impli
cated another policeman, bat did not
know his name. She designated him "the
fat policeman."
It is doubtful if Rourke's superiors will
place any reliance upon the woman's
story now, after she had deliberately
sworn five months ago to the contrary. At
that time both Rourke and Mclntyre de
nied receiving any money from her, and
both insisted upon the jullest investiga
tion.
Hannah refused to say where she got
the liquor after she left Judge Belcher's
court. Deputy Sheriff Appel was seen
and he said when he left the courtroom
with the woman she asked him to take
her to lunch, as she would not get a
"square" meal for some time again. She
had two women friends with her and he
took tbe three to a restaurant, where they
had luncheon.
'â¢There was no liquor drank," said Ap
pel, "by any of ns in the restaurant. When
we left to go to the City Prison the three
women walked in front and I walked some
paces behind them. I noticed the Land
ridge woman stagger, and when 1 walked
up and took hold of ber arm I saw she was
drunk. I accused the women of giving
ber the Jiquor, and that is the only way I
can explain how she got it."
Sheriff Whelan wab notified of the fact
that a prisoner got drunk while in the cus
tody of one of bis deputies, and it i 3 prob
aole that ne will make an investigation.
THAT POLICE BUILDING
Supervisor King Says Work on the
New Municipal Structure Will
Begin October 5 or 6.
According to Supervisor King work on
the new municipal building to be located
on tbe corner of Kearny and Washington
streets will begin about October 5 or 6.
"Work has been delayed thus far," he
declared, "because the board has bad a
six weeks' vacation. In the meantime
the architect has been employed in per
fecting his working plans.
, "The board will meet next Monday and
bids will doubtless be advertised for ten
days at that time. To tho best of my
knowledge and belief the contract will be
let and work be<?un early in October."
Although there is a regular building
committee of the board, there is a special
one on the new municiDai building, com
posed of Benjiitnin, Dunker, Hirsch,
Spreckels and King.
CASHIER HOWELLS FREE
The Supreme Court Grants His
Petition for a Habeas
Corpus.
There Was No Shewing That He
Misrepresented the Condition of
the Merced Bank.
John Wi Howells, former cashier of the
Merced Bank, is once more a free man.
The Supreme Court has thrown open bis
prison dcors with the simple, yet to him
weighty, words, "Let the prisoner be dis
charged."
Howeils was held to answer before the
Superior Court on a charge of perjury.
The bank was in liquidation, ann the
Bank Commissioners .-.ought to ascertain
whether it was actually insolvent or
whether by continuing in business it
could eventually realize upon its assets
and meet its obligations. To aid in ar
riving at this knowledge the commission
had Howells examined under oath. Dur
ing this examination tbe cisuier men
tioned among the assets an item of $176,000
for loans and overdrafts, the names of the
debtors being alphabetically arranged,
with the amount of the indebtedness of
each set opposite his name.
Howells said to Bank Commissioner
Fuller that he considered the claims good
and collectible. He did noi swear that
the value of the loans and assets was $176,
-000, or any other sum, but represented
that the several claims whose lace value
summed up that amount were good and
valid assets.
In liberating tbe prisoner the Supreme
Court says:
"There was in the evidence no reason
able or probable cause for holding the de
fendant. It appears that he was giving
the Commissioners his judgment upon
matters of extreme uncertainty, the value
and collectibility of debts. We do not
mean to say that even in a matter calling
for the exercise of judgment a perjury
ruigrtt not be predicated if one willfully
and wickedly and maliciously refrained
from exercising and expressing his best
judgment when in law bound ao to do.
But in the absence of such a showing a
charge of perjury could not be main
tained."
Salt for Unmakes.
J. Harry Scott and his wife, Mathilda M.
Scott, have sued the Southern Pacific Company
and the Pullman Palace Car Company for $lo .
000 damages. Mrs. Scott was injured by being
struck by a falling headboard while in a sleep
ing-car en route from Portland, Or., to Bin
Francisco on Jufy 21 last.

NEGLECTED MISERY.
Sirs. Tiedemann Is Slowly Dying of
Cancer Alter Going: Through
One Operation.
A sad case of human misery and human
heartlessness was reported yesterday at
the office of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelly to Children, although the
matter does not properly come within the
society's sphere of beneficence.
' Mrs. Sarah S. Tiedemann, wife of Henry
Tiederuann, was recently sent to r St.
Mary's Hospital, where she was submit
ted to a most delicate operation for cancer
of the stomach. 'The . suffering woman
survived the terrible ordeal and was taken
to her home at 129% Clara street.
The neighbors teil a story of cruel cold
ness on the part of the husband which
seems beyoui belief. He is said to , be a
drunkard* and dependent upon the earn
ings of his two sons, lads of 12 and 14
years, respectively, who bring in a monthly
income of $30 from* their work. Mrs.
Tiedemann is being attended by her aunt
and Mrs. Barrett, the landlady,: who.
though the tamily owe her $80 for rent, is
indefatigable in her endeavor* to alleviate
the condition of th* woman, who is (lowly
dying from another cancer which formed
after the operation.
The case will probably be referred to the
Catholic Ladies Aid Society.
Stierlen Arrested in Dakota.
George Stierlen, an account of whose secret
indictment by the United States Grand Jury
two week* ago, on a charge of sending obacece
matter through the mails, was published in
TjÂ£B Call, is under arrest at Fargo, N. D. It
seems that he was apprehended on Monday
last, taken before a United states Commis
sioner and in default of $2500 bail was held to
await the coming o: a local officer.
It was only yesterday, however, that
these factÃ were reported by telegraph to
Inspector- in-charge Munro, and as tho
Fnrgo district of North Dakota is et
present without a Uuited States Judge
no gteps can be taken looking toward
Stierlen's extradition, su it is probable that
several weeks will c apse beiore the muoti
wanted man can be Drought to this City.

NFW YORK, N. V. . Pept 16.â Low prices
were the rule at the Stock Exchange to-day. Pro
fessional operators were bearish to a man and
under offerings from this continent the market
gradually declined. 1 here was little news afloat
toafte't values and the dec.lne brought was due
principally to the selling by the traders who have
been predicting a reaction for some days pas'..
Money on call was more difficult to obtain and 8
per cent was paid in isolated cases. Bankers were
inclined to refuse local borrowers on Stock Ex
change rolla.eruls for the reason that the demand
from the West and South was more than enougn
to absorb their idle balances. â 
The firmness of the money market coupled with
the a< tlvlty of the bearish element forced holders
of sticks on slender margins to llqulda.e. Tie

dls lnctlon as a factor in the. wheat market to-day.
Prices at that pace were in an ascending mood
and Chicago, without displaying any parties
animation, advanced in sympathy. The strength
of St. Louis was not exhibited until some time
i.fter the opening, and until then very little busi

steady, which was commented upon. inasmuch as
our decline of yesteidi>> was, therefore, not re

have much Influence for good or bad 0:1 prices.
The marke was barely steady from the start
until the advance at St. l.ouis took place. The re

withdrawals from store were 157,027 bushels.
B adstieet's reported an increase In the world's
stocks of 2.722,000 bushels . Closing Paris aid

HIDES AND PKIN- â Hides are hither. Tal
low Is lower. The circular of W. B. Bumner & Co.
says: "There has been no special change during
the past month in Hides and Leather, and the
mailcet generally has been quiet and prices steady.
There seems to be a little more confidence in the
X si, as the financial market has some small signs
of improvement. In consequence, therefore, mere
has been somewhat mor 01 a movement in Hides
Â»nd Leather, although the trade genera. ly is very
quiet. Wet sailed Hides continue In moderate de
ma id, being taken by the tanneries In this mar
ket, and thereiore rule rule at rather liberal
figures. All dry flint Hides have to be shipped to
the Hast, as very few ure tanned- in this market,
and prices therefore are based on the vMue* which
are ootainnble In New ork and Boston. Dry Kips
continue very dull and rule at about 2c %> lb less j
than dry , Hides. Dry Calf are weak at lower
figures Wool and >heep skins are very quiet and
ru.< at lower figures than ever before known. Tal
low is very dull. Tiie best grades of Tallow are

grades, such as Wallsend. etc . still the asking
prices for cargoes nearly due indicate that o.ber
grudes of ! iÂ«>l are .being substituted, or better
quotations uould rule. - Second grades of Newcas
tle and Sydney are rinding favor with large con
sumers, in con racts are now being freely made
lor delivery Into next year at prices heretofore un
known here. The quotations named runs leave a
very meager margin for the Coal and for the car
riers, vet Importers are' eagerly seeking order*.
Next year Swan en shipments will be materially
dimimst el by our Incrt-as d imports of Australian,
as at quoted values the later Is much more eco
nomical, there being at present over $1 9 ion in
its favor." .......

Klectric Buneft in London
experiments on a comparatirely large
scaie have bpen made in Lotidorr, aocord
inj; to the Eleciricul Review. pubiistieU in
tl.at city, as to the pos ib.lity of operating
borselet-s omnibuses by electricity. Ac
cording to tiiis article the operating ex
ptnst s of 900 ommbaies by horses lor fix
mouths in London, covering a total mile
age of 10.000.000 miles, is given as 10.04 c
per orntnbus mile, exclusive of drivers,
conductors, office and general administra
tion expenses. Trials of electrical omni
buses after runnin â  a total of 5000 miles
si ow v cost of 4.880 per tui!e, exc.usive of
the Same items. The p .wer is supplied
ny storage ta.teries. The prospectus ot a
company to run much omnibnst-s has been
issued. While the-e ti-'ures are probably
not enMrely reliable, yet the lact that at
tempts are being made on a lar^e 3cale to
adopt horseless vehicles in practical work
evidences more than transient interest in
this important industrial development.

AFTERNOON MARRIAGE.
The Groom's Ancestors Figured

and Butte.
THE BRIDE FROM VIRGINIA.
Farewell to Bachelorhood and a Life's
Fealty to Democracy Celebrated
at the Same Time.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 16. J
The weddine of W r illiam H. Waste and
Miss Mary Ewing was quietly celebrated
at t:.e home of the bride's stepfather, As
sistant United States Surveyor- General
Thomas P. Harden, in Oakland at 4
o'clock this afternoon. Only the im
mediate relatives and a few intimate
friends of the young couple were present
It was one of the prettiest weddings of tne
Eeason. The large parlor of the bride's
home had been prettily decorated by lov
ing hands. Flowers, trailing vines and
green foliage bad been woven into pretty
effects and the whole room converted into
a bower of beauty. The windows were
darkened and the lighted lamps shed soft
radience around the room.
Rev. C. E. W. Smith of Alameda, for
merly paator of the M. E. Church South
in Chico and a warm friend of Mr. Waste
and Miss Ewing, performed the ceremony.
The groom, attended by his law partner,
J. W. Stetson, as best man, awaited the
bride's coming. She entered the room,
accompanied by her sister, Miss Katharine
Ewing. The young people met in front of
the minister and the words were spoken
which joined them till death shall part
During the ceremony Miss Etta Shaver,
a friend of the uriJe from girlhood, sang
softly "Call Me Thine Own.' 7
The bride wore a stylish traveling gown
of blue cloth, trimmed with brown and set
off with applique work and ribbon effect,
pale-blue front, tight sleeves with short
puff and empire skirt She carried a bou
quet cf her favorite flowers, La France
roses. Miss Catherine Ewing, the brides
maid, wore a gray mohair gown with
green applique and Dresden silk trim
mine, tight sleeves with short puff and
empire skirt. She also carried a bouquet
of La France roses. After the ceremony
Mr. and Mrs. Waste received the congratu
lations of those present. A dainty
iuucij eon was served in the dining-room,
where a merry lialf hour sped by all too
â oon.
The Helpbicstine - Mclntoch family,
from which Mr. Waste has descended, and
the Harden family, to which Mrs. Waste '
is related, are two of the oldest families of
this State. They had much to do with
the early history of Colusa and Butte
counties. Mrs. Waste is a Virginian girl,
but resided since childhood in Colusa
County until removing to Oakland three
years aso. Mr. Waste is a graduate of the
State University and Hastings Law Col
lege and is a member of the Aiameda
County Law Association-
Mr, and Mrs. Waste left for Sacramento,
where they will spend a few days, after
which they will visit in Chico and North
ern California for some time.
The members of the families and the
friends of the young couple invited to the
wedding were: Mr. and Mrs. Thomas P.
Harden, Rev. C. E. W. Smith, United
Mates Surveyor-General W. S. Green, Mrs.
M. A. Helphinstine, Mr. and Mrs. B. N.

THE FIRST NEW FIRE HOUSE
OAKLAND, Cai*. Sept 16.â Plans were completed to-day for the construction of
tbe new brie* flrebouse on Sixth street. For several years the old engine-honse has
been unfit for men to Jive in, but nothing has been done in the way of permanent im
provements. Mayor Davie proposed In his last annual message that instead of fritter
ing away money on repairs that permanent brick structures be erected me at a time.
His advice has been followed and the new building will be a model firehouse. Its cost
will be about $8000 and the construction will commence at once.

last night by an attempted burglary. The
prompt and courageous action of his
daughter was undoubtedly the means of
saving some of Mr. Wilds' property.
â¢ It was about 10 o'clock, and the family
was about to retire for the night. A sus
picious noise was heard about the pantry
window, and Miss Wilds proceeded to in
vestigate. On entering the door she was
confronted with a burly-looking man,
who had raised the window and was about
to crawl in. The young miss threw the
first article within reach at the fellow, and
began crying lustily for her father. The
intruder waited fqr no second invitation,
but left in all haste. Mr. Wilds did not
see enough of the fellow to give the police
a description, but he thinks he has the
bravest little girl in Alameda.

ball boys arrived home this morning after
an exciting trip south. Yesterday they

One of the biggest surprises in local po

John C. Britton, general manager of the
Oakland Uas-Light and Heat Company,
had consented to act as tbe third vice
JOHN C BRITTON, General Manager of the Gas Company, Vho,
After Twenty-Five Years' Experience, Says the Democracy
Cannot Be Longer Entrusted With the Country's Honor.
president of the Republ : can National
League of this city. Mr. Britton has al
ways been a sincere and conservative
Democrat.
Mr. Britton's convictions are worthy of
the greatest consideration, because he
eives substantial reasons for them.
He is a man of the people and has stead
ily worked his way to commercial promi
nence. He came to California when he
was just a dozen years old and was never
before the public as an office-seeker except
once, when he was put up for a School Di
rector many years a.o.
Mr. Brittou has always been strictly a
man of business. For a quarter of a cen
tury he has watched the progress of events
with intelligence, and when asked to out
line hi* reasons for affiliating with the
Kepublican party, he said:
"Any one occupying the position which
I do cannot do an act of this kind without
being able to give a good reason for it. In
my opinion I have very good reasons for
leaving Democracy at this time and going
into the Republican ranks. I cannot
allow myself to so far forget my training
and education as to associate with a class
of people who depreciate the honor of the
country, and this is what I consider the
Democrats are doing.
"The amliatine with men of the Popu
listic element, such they are doing this
year, is attended with great danger to
personal liberty. This clap-trap which
the Democrats give out with regard to the
tax on wealth and corporations has no
foundation in truth. The wealth of the
country can take better care of its inter
ests than such an element could.
"By the wealth of the Nation Ido not
mean capital, but the laboring man with a
small competence saved, that is what I
call tho wealth of a country. The element
that is the loudest in the demands for
'Irea silver' is not made of the men who
have â¢mall bank accounts or owners of i
homes.
"I speak from twenty-rive years' expe
rience when I say that the workingmen
with some money saved are not tbe ones
who are in the front rank of tbe 16 to 1
crowd.
"But those are the ones who do not care
to work, but who would rather sit around
in the sand lots and exhaust themselves
and their lungs in crying for the degrada
tion of the rich man.
"Tbe refusal of the Democrats to in
dorse Hill's' proposition, offered in the
Chicago convention, that nothing should
affect to debts of tbe Nation already in
curred, determined me, if there had been
nothing else, to leave the ranks of the
party. The honor of the country is at
stake, and its obligations must not be im
paired.
â¢'The financial position of the United
States is nqt one of entire independence,
but it must look somewhat to foreign
nations. The time has not come when this
country can be independent in its indus
tries even.
"There is no principle advanced by the
Democratic party on the financial issue
but that is dishonorable to the Nation,
while on the other hand the Republican
policy is practically a continuation of pros
perity. There is no country that needs j
protection worse than the United States I
to-day. I believe the country is safer in |
the hands of the Republicans to-day than
in any other."
Bennett's Sentence.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 16. â Judee
Ogden will to-morrow sentence C. j
R. Bennett, ex-secretary of the Society
for the Suppression of Vice, to the peni- i
tentiary for shooting at George Gray on j
the Seventh-street local train after Gray |
had shct twice at him.
The matter started years ago when it
is charged that Bennett led Gray's daugh- 1
ter astray when both were members of the
choir of the First Christian Church in this
city. When the father was informed of
the matter he attempted to shoot Bennett
in front of the City Hall, and later he met
him on the train and made another at
tempt, and when disarmed Bennett, who
had fled at tne first alarm, returned and
tired at him.
For Malicious Defamation.
OAKLAND, Cau, Sept. 16â John Doug
lass has tiled a suit tor $5000 damages
against Mrs. Joseph McKenzie for mali
cious defamation of character. He was a
clerk (or tf. L. Conklin, a Jocal merchant,
at $40 a monih, and alleges that on the 8th
of the present month the woman came
into the store and, in the presence of the
proprietor, Frank Anderson, J. D. Sturte
van and other worthy persons, falsely and
maliciously declared:
"That man John M. Douglass is a thief
aiyl a robber and he will rot) you, and you
will find it out if you keep him in your
employ long enough. If you can send a
respectable and honest man to my house
to solicit orders 1 will trade with you. but
Lwill not trade with you if you bend John
M. Douglass to my house, as ha is dishon
est. John M. Douglass is dishonest, and
he robbed, cheated, defrauded and swin
dled me."
Douglass claims that on account of this
statement he lost his position and has
sustained damage to the amount of the
figures named.
An Opium l)en.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 16.â Constable

successful in taking his man when under
the Influence of the drug, and securing the

expected .Bernal will give evidence which
Will lead to the proprietor's conviction.

OIL SPRINKLED ABOUT.
Suspicions Circumstances Regarding an
Early Morning Blaze.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 16.â The Chinese
store at 1462 Seventh street was discov
ered to be on fire about 2:30 o'clock this
morning, but the blaze was quickly ex
tinguished. An investigation by Chief
Fair showed that coal oil bad been freely
spilled all over the sleeping quarters of
the Chinese in the rear of the store. Tbe
bedding bad been sprinkled with oil.
This morning the Chinaman was ar
rested and gave the name of Ah Ott, but
insisted that he was in San Francisco at
the time of tbe fire and knew nothing
about it. The place was found locked
when the firemen arrived and, as there
was no insura-.ee, no motive can be dis
covered. It is thought that some one else
might have attempted to burn the place
while the Cbinaman was absent. He has
been arrested before for conducting a
lottery.
MONEY MOVING.
Oakland Workmen Keeelved Cash To-
Day for Racetrack Work.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept, 16.â Tne con
tractors at the Oakland Trotting Park
paid off to-day, and oveT $10,000 in coin
changed hands. The men are paid every
two weeks, and are about 450 in number.
The improvements about the park will
result in an outiav altogether of nearly
$200,000, and the most of this goes to local
tirms for materials and workingmen who
reside in the vicinity. The graders work
in Cay and nigbt shifts, and are moving
about 3000 cubic yards of earth in twenty
four hours.
The new grand stand is about completed,
and work on tbe mile of single stalls and
a twelve-section barn is being pushed as
rapidly as possible. The concrete founda
tion for a $15,000 stable for Dan Burns is
laid, and soon work will begin near by on

Ex-Mayor Chapman Tells Why He Is
Opposed to Senator Perkins'
Re-election.
Oakland Office Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept 16. J
Doing politics at present consists
solely in preparing tickets for Saturday's
Republican primary. The task is a hard
one, and is taxing severely the cunning
and ability of the keenest and most ex
perienced politicians. Men who have
never been on the same side in local poli
tics before now walk Broadway arm in
arm, each congratulating himself on cav
ing converted the other, and this experi
ence is quite general.
Many new features have cropped up
since the Hilborn-Frick fight of a month
ago, and prominent men who opposed
each other are now in the same camp.
Dr. Pardee and W. R. Davis were des
perate for Hilborn ; R, Leckie, E. Nas
baumer and their friends were all earnest
for Frick. Now they aro all fightinc for
F. 8. Stratton for State Senator. W. H.
Friend, who carried on the notable con
test between the two Congressional com
mittees until he secured recognition and
was made president of the "reform
committee," was an active work
er with many of the men who
are now for Stratton, while he
at this time is reported as being out for
Dr. Derrick, who is Stratton's only oppo
nent. The work of Friend, though praise
worthy in many respects and deserving of
recognition, is consideraoiy neutralized
by his desire to be elected a Supervisor.
Just how far his popularity of two months
ago has suffered cannot be told till the
primary ballots are counted. It has been
reported that Friend may not work ac
tively for the Supervisorship if he be
promised certain support for Mayor next
March, but in any event it is Known he is
after an office, and this has made great in
roads into the effectiveness of hia reform
work.
Bailey, Johnstone and Pelouze, who
wish to succeed themselves as Supervisors,
have a hard fight on hand. They have all
been accorded railroad influence in the
past, and although Pelouze voted to up
held tbe Dalton assessment his conversion
came too late to merit confidence. The
candidates for Superior Judge are also in
a delicate position. The real fight is
Greene-Hall versus Langan-Hil!. The
men who were strong lor Frick for Con
j gressman are now for the Greene-Hall
ticket and also for Bailey and Jobnstone
for Supervisors. This being so, there is a
suspicion that the railroad is at work on
the whole combination, ana if this predic
tion be fulfilled before Saturday it will
materially help the Hill-Langan end of
the fight. There is no possibility of any
railroad support going to Hill, as he is one
of tbe leading counsel who won the deci
sion for the city that takes the Oakland
water front away from the corporation.
As Davis is for Stratton and Greene ana
j Hall are making the most of their com-
I bination with Stratton also, it is evident
I that support for Stratton does not imply
support for Hall and Greene, as W. R.
Davis is certainly not opposing his own
partner.
At present the Hall-Greene-Stratton
ticket is tbe most in evidence, and the
Langan-Jlill-Derrick ticket is tbe most
quiet. Past experience has invariably
shown that the quiet ticket comes out on
top, but there are enough new elements !
this time to keep even the shrewdest I
guessing
At the meeting of the Fourth Ward Re- !
publican Club last night ex- Mayor Chap
man made some remarks about Senator
Perkins. He said:
I am opposed to the re-election of a United
States Senator who says a free-trader should
go to Congress. Perkins it a good sort of |
fellow, but tie has not the courage of his con- '
vlctions. What right has he to discredit the
nominee of the Republican party? Perkins is
a nerveless and timid man, and contrasts I
strangely with Morino, one of the marshals of
Napoleon; he also was a timid man, but had
the courage of his convictions. If George C.
Perkins had a little of that man's courage, he
should be re-elected. I have no personal ani
mosity against Senator Perkins, but every Re
publican bhould be loyal to the party ana not
support a man who in this district is against
tbe funding bill, but up In Grove L. Johnson's
district is ia favor of it
The "free-trader" to whom Mr. Chap
man alluded is 'evidently Congressman
Maeuire.
Senator Eli Denison next spoke and
said be backed up Mr. Chapman's expo- '
Bition of Senator Perkins' position, and
would think it over deeply before he
helped to make Perkins a Senator next
winter.

maries to-night for delegates to Saturday's

BARELY ESCAPED DEATH
Fire and an Explosion at the
House of James Fenian,
Berkeley.
Graham Laws, a University Student,
Is Among the Missingâ News
Notes.
BERKELEY. Cal., Sept, 16.- James
Fernan, a well-borer living on Grant
street, West Berkeley, narrowly escaped
death L>y fire shortly before 2 o'clock this
morninr. Shortly after the fire had
started, which soon enveloped his cabin,
a terrific explosion tools place which tore
the side of the building completely out.
Where the explosive matter came from
and how it happened to gat into the house
is a mystery which the occupant of the
house is attempting to solve.
Fernan was awaicened from sleep at
about 2 o'clock by the barking of his dog.
Looking about him he saw his whole
house ablaze, and before he could escape
his shirt was almost completely burned
from his back and his whiskers singed off
nearly altogether. He had barely got
outside the house when the explosion
took place. Strange to say, the dynamite
or other explosive had been placed under
his bed.
Fernan cannot account for the origin of
the fire, and consequently the general
supposition is that the explosive had been
placed under _is bed and the house fired
by an enemy bent on killing him.
Pernan's wounds, while serious, are not
dangerous. He was burned about the
hands, wrists, neck and back. He was re
moved to the County Hospital tcis after
noon for treatment.

I were there and offered toasts to the "00"

was called upon for several selections.
After the dainty viands and ices had been
several toasts were offered to the freshie
co-eds. Miss Marian Whipple '98 was
toast-mistress. Short speeches were made
after those of the president and Colonel
Edwards by Captain Gnswold of the co-ed
basket-ball team, Miss Florence Mason,
Miss la Mont, Miss Centennia Barto, Miss
Aurelia Henry, Miss Ethei McC.ymonds
and Miss Annie Laudstrom. Miss Lillian
Moller responded in behalf of the fresh
men.

ITALIANS TO CELEBRATE.
Fireworks and a Procession Will
Commemorate the 30th of
September.
The Society of the Bersaglieri Takes
the Lead in Marking the
Event
The Italian colony is preparing a cele
bration for the twenty-eighth anniversary
of the taking of Rome, which occurs on
Sunday next.
The Society of the Bersaelieri is at the
head of the celebration, though the Italian
school committee and the committe to
aid the poor are also actively participating
in the preparations, and a programme to
occupy the entire day has already been
drawn out. As the 20th of September falls
on a Sunday there will no doubt be a great
many people able to take part who were
last year prevented by their daiiy avoca
tions from sharing in the festival.
The festivities will beein with, a parade,
in which all the civil and military sociÂ«
ties in the colony will take part. The
procession is to start at 10 a. m. from the
Sala dei Bersaglier i ; it will traverse Stock
ton street. Broad way and Montgomery
avenue, after which it will return to Union
street, proceeding thence to Harbor View
ParK, wnere tbe literary and oratorical
exercises are to taKe place. Two speakers
are to be chosen, one in Italian and one
in English, and the presidents of the three
societies which are arranging the festival
have been given absolute power to chose
these two orators. The Italian Consul,
Cay. Serra, is to attend the celebration
and the president of tlie day will be Signor
Venaiilia, president of the Bersaglieri
Society.
It has been decided to have a tombola
at Harbor View, with prizes of $200, $100,
$50, etc. All tne proceeds, both of the
tombola and the rest of the celebration,
wiil be divided equally between the poor
of the colony anil the Italian school.
In the evening there will be a grand dis
play of fireworks in Union Square, with
allegorical figures of the taking of Rome,
Porta Pia, etc, while a band chosen for the
occasion, will play appropriate music. The
day wiil end with a ball in the Sala dei
Bersa^lieri.
All the committees for the celebration
of the 20th of September nave already been
chosen. The reception committee con
sists of J. F. Fugazi, A. Sbarboro, G.
Bazurro, Captain Baghetto, G. Irtusso, G.
Yensano, G. Caglieri, J. Sala, Tacconi,
Postiglione, X. L. Belgrano, Martinoni, F.
Cavagnaro, and all the Italian doctors,
lawyers and druggists in the City.
It is expected that if the coming cele
bration of the twenty-eichth anniversary
of the taking of Rome does not surpass
the celebration 01 last year, at least it will
not be inferior to it.
The three preaidenta, E. Venaglia, P.
Barbieri and A. Zabaldano, nave issned a
spirited circular, calling on all their com
patriots to aid in making the celebration
a success.

FATHER CROWLEY
IN WARLIKE BOLE
In Defense of a Child He
Soundly Chastises B.
R. Foss.
THE LATTER'S RECORD.
His Children Were Placed in
the Youth's Directory by
the Mother.
FOSS TOOK ONE BY FORCE.
On Being Pursued He Strikes the
Priest, and in Consequence Is
Badly Thrashed.
About 1 :30 o'clock yesterday afternoon
Rtv. Father D. O. Crowley, secretary and
general manager of the Youth's Directory,
on Valencia street, between Fourteenth
and Fifteenth, delivered to B. R. Foss, ex-
School Superintendent of Piumas County,
the soundest thrashing in all probability
he ever had in ail his lite.
The deed was done in defense of little
l'ercy Foss, the 6-year-oid son of the man
that received the trouncing. It is not often,
perhap?, that a member of the clergy rinds
it necessary to enter the arena of pugilism,
and the genial-mannered Father Crowley
is the last man, to all appearances, that
would do so, but while he was at it the
muscular priest executed the task in a
manner that would have gladdened the
heart of Professor Robert Fitzsimnions, as
Foss' countenance weil attests.
In 1894 Foss was Supeiintendent of
Schools in Piumas County. While occupy
ing this office he emb. zzled certain school
funds and tied to Honolulu. His where
abouts were discovered, and t:ie proper
extradition papers having been issued, he
was brought back, tried and convicted and
sentenced to two years' penal servitude.
After serving from June to October he was
pardoned, and went to Honolulu to rejoin
his wife.
About four months ago, according to the
tale told by his children, his wife lett him
and returned to California on account of
the way In which Foss treated her and the
children. The little ellows ii> question,
Willie. Wilson and Percy, aged respect
ively 12, 10 and b" years, were taken to the
Youth's Directory by the mother. They
have been attending the Marshall Pri
mary School on Mission street, between
Fourteenth and Fifteentn.
About 1:15 p. M. yesterday Wiilie, the
eldest, came rushing to Father Crowley at
the directory, stating that his father had
come and taken Percy, the youngest,
away apainst bis will. Mrs. Walker, the
principal, he said, wished him to come at
one?.
Father Crowley hurried after Foss and
overtook him on Valencia street, Detween
Fourteenth and Fifteenth. Littie Percy
was crying bitterly as his father led him
along. The priest at once demanded by
what authority Foss thus took the child
away by force.
"Because he is my child," was the
answer, "and I don't want him under the
care of any Roman Catholic priest."
Father Crowley cautioned Foss against
using such language on the street, when
the irate parent poured forth a torrent ot
abuse and vile epithets and struck the
priest in the face.
Although he had remained perfect
ly quiet under the abuse, this blow
was the "last straw," and Father Crowley,
in a fit of righteous indignation, sailed in
with nis fists. When Foss' countenence
became the prototype of a raw beefsteak
he lustily yelied, "Enough ! enough I" and
his conqueror desisted from any further
pummeling.
By this time an immense crowd had
gathered and the excitement was at fever
heat. Patrolman Folsom was attracted
by the size of the assemblage and, run
ning up, took the combatants, accom- !
panied by little Percy, to the Southern
station. The priest there related his story
and was promptly released. As he refused
to preier any charge against Foss the
latter was released also, and little Percy
was sent back to the Marshall Primary.
Lieutenant Burke was very reticent as
regaris the matter and refused to make
any statement of the facts, referring the
interrogator to Father Crowley at the
Youth's Directory.
"You don't know how sorry I am thi3
occurred," said Father Crowley. "as it
places me in a very awkward predicament
to be obliged to pose before the public in a
bellicose role.
"But .here is one matter I wish to ex
plain. When a child is placed here, it
makes no difference whether by the
father or the mother, that person is re
garded by us as the child's custodian, and
the other parent is not allowed to inter
fere with it unless the courts decide that
such parent is the proper guardian.
"We take good care of the little one, the
religion of its parents cutting no figure in
the matter. When the parent that places
it wishes to remove it, well and good.
"1 was not surprised at what occurred
to-day, as I heard a few days ago that Foss
had declared his intention of blowing both
mother and children out of existence.
Before be struck me to-day he threatened
to uae arms on me, and I watched him
carefully, but at the police station he was
found to be unarmed. The man was per
fectly sober."
The children were here sent for and cor
roborated Father Crowley's story in full.
They also said that in Honolulu their
father used to beat and otherwise abuse
them and once threw a lighted lamp at
their mother.
"I put water in the whisky he used to
drink," piped little Wilson, "and when
Papa discovered it be threw it all over me."
Airs. Waiter, the principal of the Mar
shall Primary School, states that when
she remonstrated with Foss he said he
was shortly going to teach school in Ala
meda County, and, as he was an A. P. A.,
NEW TO-DAT.
TacelauT
AND
bleeding
, My. little boy -was afflicted with Eczema in
â¢cute form for a year, during which we tried
without success every known remedy. The dis-
order appeared on the right cheek and was of a
bliftery and bloody form. His pillow, mornings,
would bear the bloody imprint of the side of his '
face, while it was impossible to prevent him
from scratching his face owing to the itching.
Advised to try Ccnctnu, I bought a box. ' The
first application was made at night, and it is a
fact, that the appearance of the affected part*
â bowed a noticeable improvement the next morn-
ing, and, continuing the treatment, as a result,
my child ha* as fair and smooth skin as can be
found anywhere. .

THE CHURCH WILL OPEN
The Key. Mr. Adams of St. Louis Will
Take Temporary Charge of the *'irÂ«t
CoNgregational Flock.
Next Sunday the pulpit of the First
Congregational Church will be supplied,
and the adherents and opponents of the
Rev. Dr. Charles O. Brown, the late pas
tor, will have a chance to listen to the
Rev. George C, Adams, recently of St.
Louis.
After last night's prayer-meeting the
First Congregational Society heid a spe
cial session, Deacon Dexter presiding.
Letters of transfer were granted to Mrs.
W. K. Benjamin to the Union Church of
Belvedere and to M;s. May S. Morton, who
will henceforth worship with Dr. Macken
zie's flock on Van Xess" avenue.
Deacon Dexter read a report condemn
ing the wild statements published regard
ing the church, and expressed a hope that
such publications might soon cease. He
also announced that regular services on
Sundays and Wednesdays in the church
wculd be resumed.
Deacon Morse read several letters to and
from Mr. Adams, and a telegram wherein
tbe reverend gentleman said hft would
arrive here in time to preach on Sunday.
Meanwhile it was judged prudent to
request the trustees to defer their proposed
resignation until Mr. Adams' visit.
A secret session of the deacons and
standing committee was heid after the
public meeting and arrangements were
made for the payment of the Rev. Mr.
Adams during his occupancy of the
pulpit.

KILLED BY A CABLE-CAR.
Simon Finn, an Oiler on the
Geary-Street Line, Crushed
to Death.
Apparent Carehssn ss on the Part of
Some One Causes Another Hor
rible Accident.
An accident of peculiar carelessness, in
which a man lost his life, occurred at the
Geary-street carhouse, on Point Lobos ave
nue, between First Bnd Second, yes
terday morning. Simon Finn, for four
teen years employed a? an oiler, was run
over by a car at 8:55 o'clock, receiving in
ternal injuries from the effects of which he
died four hours later.
Among the duties assigned Finn is that
of oiling the spur-track leading from the
carhouse to the main line. . He generally
got around to this work about 8:30 o'clock,
but yesterday was nearly hah an hour
late. This, however, was due to no fault
of nis, but to, more onerous duties else
where. In any event, Finn was lying on
the track, with his back toward the car
house.
It is customary at that hour to increase
tht number of cars on the main line, and
it was the first of these extras that brought
about poor Finn's death. The car was
run out of the house by two men, and had
gained considerable momentum when it
struck Finn. He was horribly crushed
about the chest and shoulder;*, and when !
examined at the French Hospital it was
found that he could not possibly recover.
Another version of the accident is that
a car coming from the City was switched
into the carhouse for the purpose of being
turned around. The conductor and mo
torman pushed it out backward and right
over Finn, who was looking in the direc
tion whence cars ordinarily came.
Finn was a single man. about 40 years
old. During the last ten years he has by
strict economy managed to save a snu^
little fortune, which â will be divided
among half a dozen cousins and aunts
who reside in this City.
Alfred Smith, the eripman on the car,
surrendered himself at the Central police
station. He was booked on the charge of
manslaughter, and was released on his
own recognizance by Judge Lowe.
Smith said he did not know that Finn
was working in the hole, as his head was
below the level of the ground when the
car reached the hole.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1896.
SIX OFFICERS
WILL HOLD OVER
This Is the Decision Now
Given by the Supreme
Court.
OTHERS TO BE ELECTED
Chief Justice Beatty and Justice
Temple Dissent From This
View.
SOME OPPOSING CONSTRUCTIONS
Summary of the Reasoning Which
Has Led the Justices Very
Far Apart
The decision of the Supreme Court con
cerning the tenure of offices in the City
and County of San Francisco was banded
down yesterday. The opinion was written
by Justice Harrison and was concurred in
by Justices McFarland, Henshaw, Van
Fieet and Garoutte. The following offi
cers under this decision will hold over
for the term of four years:
District Attorney.
County Clerk.
Sheriff.
County Recorder.
Coroner.
Public Administrator.
Concerning other officers it was held
that their term of office "and also of the
Judges of the Police Court and of the Jus
tices of the Peace who were elected at the
general election in 1894 has not been
changed by the county government act,
and that an election for their successors
must be held at the coming general elec
tion."
A dissenting opinion was filed by Justice
Temple, in which Chief Justice Beatty
concurred. The essential parts of the dis
senting opinion are contained in the fol
lowing extracts:
"We cannot, therefore, select certain of
ficers and say that they are county officers
and of other 3 â  that they are city officers,
for all are municipal officers and munici
pal officers only. Therefore, if it be true
that the Legislature cannot in this mode
change the terms of the officers of the
ncers ana say that they are county officers
and of other 3 â  that they are city officers,
for all are municipal officers and munici
pal officers only. Therefore, if it be true
that the Legislature cannot in this mode
change the terms of the officers of the
municipality, because that would be to
aiter the charter, this law can have no ap
plication to the City and County of San
Francisco. â¢ * * In my opinion the
Legislature did not intend to ordain that I
some of the officers should hold office for
four years and others for two. there being i
no reason for the difference."
The reason given by the majority of the
court for their conclusions is summed up
concisely in the following paragraph:
"The District Attorney, Sheriff, County
Clerk, County Recorder, Coroner and Pub- !
lie Administrator are officers whose powers
Utd duties are given by the county gov- I
eminent act, or by other general laws, |
and do not derive any authority from the |
consolidation act, or exercise any function
in the municipal government of San Fran
cisco. These officers are, therefore, county
officers, and their term of office, as well as
the time of their election, are those pro
vided by the county government act."
The case, which will oe historical, was
entitled, Julius Kahn. appellant, vs.
Adolph Sutro et al., respondents. The
point at Imiu is thus stated:
The plaintiff brought this action to restrain
the Board of Election Commissioners of San
Francisco from calling an election for City
and County officers at the com inn general elec
tion and from incurring the expanses attend
ant thereon, claiming that under the provi
sions of the county government act of 1893,
as construed in the case of Hale vs. McUetti
gan, recently decided, there can be no election
for such oflicers until the general election in
1898. Judgment was rendered in favor of the
defendants upon a demurrer to the complaint,
and the rijaintift" hus appealed therefrom.
The question presented for determination is
whether the above act of 1893 applies to the
Cily and County of San Kraacisco, and the de
termination of this question depends upon the
character of that body corporate in its rela
tion to the other portions of the State â
whether It is to be regarded as a city or as a
county. One feature by which a city Is dis
tinguished irom a county, in this State, is the
sojree from which its authority Is derived.
The powers to be exercised under a county
government are conierred by the Legislature,
irrespective of the will of the inhabitants of
the county, whereas the inhabitants of a city
are authorized to determine whether they will
accept the corporate powers offered them, to
be exercised by officers of their own selection.
In Hamilton County vs. Mighels (7 Ohio
St. 109), the distinction between these two
bodies was given in these words: "Municipal
corporations proper are called into existence
through the direct solicitation, or by the free
consent, of the people who compose them.
Counties are legal subdivisions of a State,
created by tne sovereign power of the State, of
its own sovereign will, without the particular
solicitation, consent or concurrent action of
the people who inhabit them. The former
organization is asked tor, or at least assented
to, by the people it embraces; the latter is
superimposed by a sovereign and paramount
authority."
The court discussed the attributes of
"The City and County of San Francisco,"
finding that the attributes of both a city
and county are recognized by the consti
tution ; t at geographically it is one of
the legal subdivisions of the State ana in
that respect is recognized as one of the
counties of the State; and that politically
it is considered by the constitution as a
municipal corporation. Tha history of
legislation from the act passed by the
Legislature, at its first session, after the
adoption of the constitution, known as the
"McClure charter," purporting to provide
for the government of ban Francisco, was
reviewed, and the view was held that:
"The charter of San Francisco is made up
of the consolidation act and tt.e amend
ments thereto, together with such other
statutes relating to the government of the
City and County, or conferring powers
upon its offioera, as were in force at the
adoption of the present constitution."
Concerning the creation of San Fran
cisco and its status the court was of
opinion as follows:
The City of San Francisco was created and
its limits defined by the act of April 15, 1850
(Stats, of 1850, p. 223), and section 2 ot that
act declared that "The inhabitants of the City
of San Francisco, within the limits above de
scribed, shall be and they are hereby consti
tuted a body politic and corporate in fact and
in law, by the name and style of the 'City of
San Francisco.' " Section lof the act 01 April
j 19, 1856 (Stats, of 1856, p. 145), commonly
I krown as the consolidation aci, by virtue of
! which the present corporate character of San
Francisco exists, declares, "The corporation or
body politic and â corporate now existing and
known as the Ciiy of San Francisco shall re
main and continue to be a body politic and
I corporate in name and in fact, by the name of
The City and County of S >n Francisco, etc."
The effect of this legislative action was
merely to continue with extended boundaries
and additional powers the City of San Fran-
Cisco, which had been Incorporated in 1850;
and, although the provisions of the charter
were, in many respects, appropriate for a
â  county, the corporation thus created remained
a city under a different name, but the inhabit
ants of me territory thus brought under the
provisions of the city charter were not in
veated with county government. (People vs.
Supervisors, 21 Â«a 1..668; Wood vs. Election
Commissioners, 58 Cab, 561.) Section 8 of
article XI of the constitution, as originally
adopted, provided that any "city" containing
a population of more than 100,000 inhabit
ants might cause a freeholders' charter to be
iramed for its own government.
Under this provision of the constitution the
inhabitants of San Francisco elected a Board

of Freeholders in 1880, and the validity of this
election and the power of ihe board to irame a
charter was ui>held in People vs. Hoge, 55
CaL, 612, upon the ground that under this
section of the constitution San Francisco was
a city. In Staude vs. Election Commissioners.
til Cai., 313, it was held that the i-ir.-vi.-ion> oi
section 4109 of the Political Code, as amended
in 1881, by which the time for the election of
city and c<>unty as well as other officers
throughout the Slate whs changed, were ap
plicable to Ktin Frandisco by virtue of the
clause in section 6 of article XI, that "cities
or towns heretofore organized shall be subject
to and controlled by general laws." It may
therefore be regarded as settled by the de
cisions of this court that the City and County
of San Francisco is a municipal corporation,
and in matters of government is to be regarded
as a city.
But, while the people of San Francisco are
thus to be regarded as. under a municipal gov
ernment, with the right to select officers to
execute the powers of that government accord
ing to the terms of its chirter, the territory
over which that government is exercised is at
the same time a county, and for those purposes
for which county officers exorcise authority,
not derived from the charter and disconnected
with municipal, government,* its officers are
properly termed county officers. Considered
m its political and judicial relations to other
portions of the State the officers elected by us
voters, to the extent that they exercise only
such powers as are given by laws relating
merely to counties and who do not derive any
of their authority frÂ«ro the charter, are Â«o be
regarded as county officers as distinguished
from city officers.
It is not possible to make a harmonious con
struction oi the terms "county," "cuy" and
"city and county," as they are used .in the
constitution. The term "county" is some
times used therein as a geographical subdi
vision of the State; sometimes as a political
division for the exercise of governmental
functions, and in the latter use, it is some
times employed as the equivalent of "city ana
couuty," and sometimes as distinguished
therefrom; and the term "city and county" is
sometimes used as the equivalent of "city."
San Francisco is distinctly recognized therein
as the geographical equivalent ot a countyâ as
in the provision for me election of Judges of
the Superior Court, and for ti e formation of a
district for the election of a Railroad Commis
sioner: and to bold that it is not a county for
any purpose| would render inoperative many
provisions of the . constitution uiid of the
statutes of the State; which have heretofore
been recognized as applicable to it, with the
result that unsuspected difficulties and per
plexities would arise in tne.administration of
justice.
Without enumerating many instances it is
sufficient to call attention to the fact that
there would be in that city no provision for a
Grand Jury or for a Board of Equalization, or
for the exercise of any appellate jurisdiction
by the Superior Court, or for the exercise ot
eminent domain, or for creating the lien of a
judgment upon real estate, or for the probate
of wills, or ior filing articles of incorporation ;
and the practitioner will readily perceive
the confusion that would result in criminal
jurisprudence, as well as in civil practice, if
the City and County of San Francisco is to be
excluded wherever the term "county" is used.
The case of the city of St. Louis was
cited.
The Missouri case was held to be some
what analogous to the San Francisco case,
and the opinion goes on as follows, after
stating the facts concerning the extension
of the boundaries of San Francisco, etc. :
Title II of part 4 of the Political Code is de
voted to "The Government oi Counties, and in
chapter 3 of that title are found provisions
designating the officers of a county and pre
scribing their powers and duties. Until this
portion of the Political Code was superseded
by the coun'y government act it was the only
statute oi the State which defined the powers
and duties of certain officers elected by the
voters of San Francisco, and upon the enact
ment of the county government act that
statute alone became the source from which
these officers have derived their powers.
San Francisco is, thereiore, both a city and a
county, and although the boundaries ot the
two bodies corporate are coincident the elec
tors within this territory vote f-*r officers
whose authority and functions are derived ex
clusively from the charter of the city, and a.so
for officers whoso powers and duties are pre
scribed by general iaws and upon which the
cnarterMs silent. It must follow from this that
some of its officers are city officers and others
are county officers. There is nothing unusuai
or inconsistent in this.
It would not be contended, if the city was
only a portion of the county or if the county
should be composed entirely of incorporated
cities, that the State would be precluded from
au:horizing the election by the voters of the
county of officers to carry out those provisions
of its Uws which pertain to the State at In rue,
and which have no connection with munici
pal affairs, and -.his rule is not changed where
the couuty consists of a single ei.y, instead ot
several. Although the same body of voters
choose the different officers, the ;unctlons of
the officers chosen by them are distinct in their
nature, and the character of the officers must
De determined by the source of their authority
and the functions they are to exercise.
Section 5 of article XI of the constitution
declares: ''The Legislature by general and
uniform laws shall provide for the election or
appointment in the several counties of Boards
oi Superv.sors, Sheriffs, County Clerks, District
Attorneys, and such other county, township
and municipal officers as public convenience
may require."
In obedience to this direction, the Legisla
ture passed the couutv government act of
1893, declaring what county officers shall be
elected, in which are included those desig
nated in the above section, prescribing their
duties and fixing their term of office at four
years, tome of the officers whose election is
thus authorized are the same in name and
are given the same or similar functions as are
officers authorized by the consolidation act to
be elected in San Francisco, while others
whose election is authorized by each of these
statutes have no authority except that which
is given in the county government act.
On the other hand, the consolidation act
authorise! the election of several officers
wkm election is not authorized by the !
county government act. and who are not j
named therein as county officers. Those offi
cers whose election is authorized by each of
thei-e statutes, but who are required by the
consolidation act to perform the duties
therein prescribed, <so not cease to be muni
cipal officers because under the county gov
ernment act similar duties are prescribed for
county officers of the same name.
To the extent that these officers are a com
ponent part of the municipal government
they are municipal officers, and do not cease
to be such by reason of the fact that other
functions which pertain to county officers are
imposed upon them. The guaranty given to
the City and County of San Francisco by the
constitution of the right to continue its
government under the charter which it held
at the adoption of that instrument, until it
>shail adopt another, including the right given
by that charter to change its officers every two
years, if it shall so elect, cannot be taken away
by the Legislature under the form of imposing
upon the officers certain functions exercised
oy county officers in other counties of the.
State, and fixing the term of such, county'
officers at four years.
But as the Territory thus placed under
municipal government still remains a county,
and is not taken out of the control of the State
for all purposes not embraced within the
scope of municipal government, the authori
zation by the Legislature of an election by
the voters of that territory for officers to carry
out tnese laws does not make the persons so
elected city officers. The constitution has de
clared that certain officers shall be elected
within each county, and, if San Francisco is a
county, the Legislature is authorized to pro
vide lor the election of these officers by its
voters, and is not precluded therefrom by the
fact that they are voted for by the electors of
the municipality at the same time with the
election of its municipal officers. Prior to
1876 the voters of San Francisco elected one
oi the members of the Board of State Harbor
Commissioners, but that fact did not consti
tute him a city officer.
The officers oi the City and County of San
Francisco are designated in the act of April 2,
18G6 (Statutes oi 18G6, p. 718) as follows.:
'There shall De elected hereafter for the City
and County of San Francisco, by the qualified
electors thereot, at the timts hereinatter men
tioned and in the manner prescribed by law
for the election. of State and county officers,
one Mayor, who shall be tx-oflicio President of
the Board of Supervisors; a County Judge, Po
lice Judge, an Attorney and Counselor, Pro
bate Judsre, District Attorney, SheritF, County
Clerk, Recorder, Treasurer, Auditor, Tax Col
lector, Assessor, Coroner, Puolic Adminis
trator, Surveyor, Superintendent of Common
Schools, Superintendent of Public Streets,
Highways and Squares, Chief of Police, Harbor
Master and StatL- Harbor Commissioner. There
shall be elected in each of the twelve present
election districts of said cty and county,
which shall hereafter constitute municipal
districts and be designated and known in law
as wards, by the qualified electors thereof, one
Supervisor and one School Director."
The term uf office tor these officers was fixed
by the act at two years. The time for their
election was subsequently changed, and is now
fixed by seciiou 4109 ft! tne Political Code.
'Ihe offices of County Judee and Probate Judge
wero abolished by the constitution and that of
Hurbor Master b: statute.
The Police Judge has been superseded by the
Judges of the Po.ice Court, and certain changes
havi- been made in the mode of electing Super
visors. The Chief of Police and the State Har
bor Commissioner have ceased to be elective
officers. It will be observed thai this statute
does not declare that these are City officers, or
are officers of the city and county, but m< rely
that tnese officers "shall be elected for the City
and County uf t'<Â«n Francisco by the qualified
olectors thereof," leaving the character oi t:ie
officer, whether he is to be denominated a
county officer or a municipal officer, to be de
termined by the nature of the duties he is to
periorm and the source from which he derives
liis authority.
Of the officers above enumerated, the Mayor,
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
Attorney and Counselor, sometimes styled
City and County Attorney (see Stats, of 1871-2,
d. 232), Superintendent of Public Streets,
Highways and Squares and School Directors
are not named in the county government act
as'county officers, and consequently cannot be
subject to the provisions of that statute.
Judges of the Police Court are not named in
the county government act, either as county
or township officer*, and no provision is found
therein relative to their duties or term of
office.
The Treasurer, Auditor, Tax Collector and
Surveyor are designated in the consolidation
act as officers ot the municipality, and are re
quired to perform certain municipal duties
which are not required from county officers
who are elected tor these offices in their re
spective counties. In addition to these duties,
the Treasurer is constituted a par* of the ap
pointing po.Ter for the License Collector
(Stats, of 1872, p. 736), the Auditor la made a
member ot the Board of New City Hall Com
missioners (Stats. 1876, p. 461), and the Audi
tor, the Tax Collector and the City and County
Surveyor are members of the Board of Election
Commissioners for the City and County.
(Stats, of 1878, p. 299.)
The Supervisers authorized by the consol
idaton act to be elected do not constiiute the
same body as that authorized by the county
government act, although they bear the same
name. Th.c Board of Supervisors authorized
by the consolidation act is for the government
of the city and county, and consists of twelve
members, while the Board of Supervisors
authorized fora county consists of only five
members, and exercises functions peculiarly
appropriate to a county, but has not the
authority required for providing for the wants
of a city. â¢
The Court discussed at much length the
status of Justices of the Peace, and the
conclusion is reached that:
From these considerations it must be held
tha.t the provision in the county government
act fixing the term of office of Justices of the
Peace for the townships into which the several
counties are divided at four years, does not
j apply to the Justices of the Peace elected for
the City and County oi San Francisco. We hQld,
therefore, that the term of office of the forego
ing municipal officers, and also of the Judges
of the Police Court, and of the Justices of the
Peace who were elected at the general election
in 1894, has not been changed by the county
government act, and that an election for their
I successors must be held at the coming general
I election.
The dissenting opinion holds, in ad
dition to what has already been indicated
by extracts, that the consolidated City
and County is a municipal corporation;
that the corporation brought into exist
ence by the consolidation succeeded to
the rights and liabilities, of both of the
| governments that were merged; that all
the officers were municipal and that in no
sense were some County officers and some
City officers.
\V> cannot, therefore, elect certain officers
and say thai they are County officers and of
others that they are City officers, for all are
i municipal officer-*, and municipal officers only.
I Therefore, if it be true that the Legislature
cannot in this mode change the terms of the
! officers of the municipality, because that
| would be to alter the charter, this law can
have no application to the City and County oi
San Francisco. It would not follow from this
that general laws affecting the powers and
duties of County officers would not apply to
the officers of the consolidated City and
County. The idea of a consolidated Â»rovcrn
ment of tlii9 character is that thereby the
State provides for the inhabitants of the in
cluded territory the benefit of a county gov
ernment. To do this effectually euch laws
must apply to t. c consolidated government.
As to the corporate existence of the muni
; cipality and the officers through whom the
corporate functions shall be discharged, no
reason exists why such interference should be
allowed, and if it were conceded that the
Legislature could so change the municipal
charter, we cannot presume that it was in
tended. It was not necessary that the act
shall include the consolidated City and County
in order that the law sbaU have a general and
uniform operation. Tne City and County of
San Francisco is not a mere county, but is I
recognized in the constitution itself again and
again as constituting a cl.iss apart. Oi course, j
if it is a municipal corporation, and therefore
the Legislature cannot tau chauee itscharter,
this point need not be further discussed.
