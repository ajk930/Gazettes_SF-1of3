CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 26. â Major McKinley gave his letter of accept
ance to the pre>s associations this afternoon, having finished his last read
ing and revision of it at 12:30 o'clock. The letter touches upon all of the
important planks in the Republican National platform, but the first half
of it is devoted to an incisive discussion of the money question. The let
ter is as follows :
Hon. John M. Thurston and others, members of the Notification Committee
of the Republican National Convention â Gentlemen: In pursuance of the
promise made to your committee when notified of my nomination as the
Republican candidate for President, I beg to submit this formal accept
ance of that high honor and to consider in detail questions at issue in the
I -ending campaign. Perhaps tbis might be considered unnecessary in
view of my remarks on that occasion and those I have made to delegations
that have visited me since the St. Louis convention; but in view ot the
momentous importance of tbe proper settlement of the issues presented
to our future prosperity and standing as a nation and considering only the
welfare and happiness of our people, I could not be content to omit again
. calling attention to the questions which, iv my opinion, vitally affect our
strength and position among the governments of the world, and our
morality, integrity and patriotism as citizens of that republic wnich for a
century past has been the best hope of the world and the inspiration of
mankind. We must not now prove false to our own standards in govern
ment, nor unmindful of the noble example and wise precepts of the
lathers, or of tbe confidence and trust which our conduct in the past has
always inspired.
THE FREE COINAGE OF SILVER.
For the first time since 1868, if ever before, there is presented to the
American people this year a clear and direct issue as to our monetary
system, of vast importance in its effects and upon the right settlement of
which rests largely the financial nonor and prosperity of the country. It
is proposed by one wing of the Democratic party and its allies, tne People's
and Silver parties, to inaugurate the free and unlimited coinage of silver
by independent action on the part of the United States at a ratio of six
teen ounces of silver to one of gold. The mere declaration of this purpose
is a menace to our financial and industrial interests, and has already
created universal alarm. It involves great peril to the credit and business
of the country, a peril bo grave that conservative men everywhere are
breaking away from their old party associations and uniting with other
patriotic citizens in emphatic protest against the platform of the Demo
cratic National Convention as an assault upon the faith and honor of the
Government and the welfare of the people. We have had few questions in
the lifetime of the Republic more serious than the one which is thus
presented.
The character of the money which shall measure our values and ex
changes, and settle our balances with one another and with the nations
of the world, is of such primary importance and so far reaching in its conse
quences as to call for the most painstaking investigation, and, in the end,
a sober, unprejudiced judgment at the polls. We must not be misled by
phrases nor deluded by false theories. Free silver would not mean that
silver dollars were to be freely had without cost or labor. It would mean
tne free use of the mints of the United States for the few who are owners
of silver bullion, but would make silver coin no freer to the many who
are engaged in other enterprises. It would not make labor easier, tne
hours of labor shorter, or the pay better. It would not make farming
less laborious, or more profitable. It would not start a factory, or make a
demand for an additional day's labor. It would create no new occupa
tions. It would add nothing to the comfort of the masses, the capital of
the people, or the wealth of the Nation. It seeks to introduce a new
measure of value, but would add no value to the thing measured. It
would not conserve values; on the contrary, it would derange all existing
values. It would not restore business confidence, but its direct effect
would be to destroy the little which yet remains.
The meaning of the coinage plank adopted at Chicago is that any one
may take a quantity of silver bullion, now valued at 53 cents, to the mints
of the United States, have it coined at the expense of the Government,
and receive for it a silver dollar, which shall be legal tender for the pay
ment of all debts, public and private.
The owner of the silver bullion would get the silver dollar; it would
belong to him and to nobody else. Other people would get it only by
their labor, the products of their land or something of value. The bullion
owner, on the basis of present values, would receive the silver dollar for
53 cents' worth of silver, and other people would be required to receive it
as a full dollar in the payment of debts. The Government would get
nothing from the transaction. It would bear the expense of coining the
silver and the community would suffer loss by its use.
We have coined since 1878 more than four hundred millions of silver
dollars, which are maintained by tbe Government at parity with gold,
and are full legal tender for the payment of ail debts, public and private.
How are the silver dollars now in use different from those which would be
in use under free coinage? They are to be of the same weight and fine
ness; they are to bear the same stamp of the Government. Why would
they not be of the same value? I answer: The silver dollars now in use
were coined on account of the Government, and not for private account
or gain, and the Government has solemnly agreed to keep them as good as
the best dollars we have. The Government bought the silver bullion at its
market value and coined it into silver dollars. Having exclusive control
of the mintage, it only coins what it can hold at a parity with gold. The
profit, representing the difference between the commercial value of silver
bullion and the face value of the silver dollar, goes to the Government for
the benefit of the people. The Government bought the silver bullion con
tained in the silver dollar at very much less than its coinage value. It
paid it out to its creditors and put it in circulation among the people at its
face value of one hundred cents, or a full dollar. It required the people to
accept it as a legal tender and is thus morally bound to maintain it at a
parity with gold, which was then, as now, the recognized standard with
us, and the most enlightened nations of the world. The Government
having issued and circulated tbe silver dollar, it must in honor protect the
holder from loss. This obligation it has so far sacredly kept. Not only is
there a moral obligation but there is a legal obligation expressed in
public statute to maintain, the parity.
THEY COULD NOT BE KEPT AT PAR.
Tnese dollars, in the particulars I have named, are not the Â«ame as
the dollars which would be issued under free coinage. They would be the
same in form, but different in value. The Government would have no
part in the transaction, except to coin the silver bullion into dollars. It
would share ,o part oi the profit. It would take upon itself no obligation.
It. would not put the dollars into circulation. It could only get them, as
any citizen would get them, by giving something for tnem. It would deliver.

action there end. Such are the silver dollars which would be issued under
free coinage of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1. Who would then maintain the
parity? What would keep them at par with gold? There would be no
obligation resting upon the Government to do it. and if toere were, it
would be powerless to do it. The simple truth is, we would be driven to
a silver basis, to silver monometallism. These dollars, therefore, would
stand upon their real value.
If the free and unlimited coinage of silver at a ratio of sixteen ounces
of silver to one ounce of gold would, as some of its advocates assert, make
53 cents in silver worth 100 cents, and the silver dollar equal to the gold
dollar, then we would have no cheaper money than now, and it would be
no easier to get, but that such would be the result is against reason and is
contradicted by experience in all lands. It means the debasement of our
currency to the amcunt of the difference between the commercial and
coin value of the silver dollar, which is ever changing, and the effect
â¢would be to reduce property values, entail untold financial loss, destroy
confidence, impair the obligations of existing contracts, further impover
ish the laborers and producers of the country, create a panic of unparal
leled severity and inflict upon trade and commerce a deadly blow.
Against any such policy I am unalterably opposed. ,
Bimetallism cannot be -secured by independent action on our part. It
cannot be sustained by opening our mints to the unlimited coinage of the
silver of the world at a ratio of sixteen ounces of silver to one ounce of
gold, when the commercial ratio is more than thirty ounces of silver to
one ounce of gold. Mexico and China have tried the experiment. Mexico
has free coinage of silver and gold at a ratio slightly in excess of sixteen
and a half ounces of silver to one ounce of gold, and while her mints are
freely open to both metals at that ratio not a single dollar in gold bullion
is coined and circulated as money. Gold has been driven out of circula
tion in these countries and they are on a silver basis alone.
Until international agreement is had it is the plain duty of the United
States to maintain the gold standard. It is the recognized and sole stand
ard of the great commercial nations of the world with which we t^ade
more largely than any other. Eighty-four per cent of our foreign trade
for the fiscal year 1895 was with gold standard countries, and our trade
with other countries was settled on a gold basis.
WE NOW HAVE MORE SILVER THAN GOLD.
Chiefly by means of legislation during and since 1878 there has been
put in circulation more than $624,000,000 of silver or its representative.
This has been done in an honest effort to give silver, if possible, the same
bullion and coinage value and encourage the concurrent use of both gold
and silver as money. Prior to that time there had been less than nine
millions of silver dollars coined in the financial history of the United
States, a period of eighty-nine years. This legislation secured the largest
use of silver consistent with financial safety and the pledge to maintain
its parity with gold. We have to-day more silver than gold. This has
been accomplished at times with grave peril to the public credit.
The so-called Sherman law sought to use all the silver product of the
United States for money at United States market value. From 1890 to 1893
the Government purchased 4,500,000 ounces of silver a month, or 54,000,000
ounces a year. This was one-third of the product of the world and
practically all of this country's product. It was believed by those
who then and now favor tree coinage that such use of silver would
advance its bullion value to its coinage value, but this expectation was
not realized. In a few months, notwithstanding the unprecedented mar
ket for the silver produced in the United States, the price of silver went
down very rapidly, reaching a lower point than ever before. Then, upon
the recommendation of President Cleveland, both political parties united
in the repeal of the purchasing clause of the Sherman law. We cannot
with safety engage in further experiment in this direction.
On the 22d of August, 1891, in a public address, 1 said: If we could
have an international ratio, which all the leading nations of the world
would adopt, and the true relation be fixed between the two metals, and
all agree upon the quantity of silver which should constitute a dollar, then
silver would be as free and unlimited in its privileges of coinage as cold
is to-day. But that we have not been able to secure, and with the free
and unlimited coinage oi lilver adopted in the United States at the present
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, AUGUST 27, 1896.
ratio, we would be still further removed from any international agreement.
We may never be able to secure it if we enter upon the isolated coinage of
silver. The double standard implies equality at a ratio, and that equality
can only be established by the concurrent law of nations. It was the con
current law of nations that made the gold standard ; it wilt require the
concurrent law of nations to reinstate ana sustain it.
IT FAVORS THE USE OF SILVER MONEY.
The Republican party has not been, and is not now opposed to the use
of silver money, as its record abundantly shows. It has done all that
could be done for its increased use, with safety and honor, by the United
States acting apart from other Governments. There are those who think
that it has already gone beyond the limit of financial prudence. Surely
we can go no further, and we must not permit false lights to lure ua
across the danger line.
We have more silver in use than any country in the world except
India or Chinaâ ssoo,ooo,ooo more than Great Britain, $150,000,000 more
than France, $400,000,000 more than Germany, $325,000,000 less than India,
and $125,000,000 iess than China. Tne Republican party has declared
in favor of any international agreement, and if elected President it
will be my duty to employ all proper means to promote it. The free coin
age of silver in this country would defer, if not defeat, international bimet
allism, and until an international agreement can be had every interest re
quires us to maintain our present standard. Independent free coinage of
silver at a ratio of sixteen ounces of silver to one ounce of gold would in
sure the speedy contraction of the volume of our currency. It would
drive at least live hundred millions of gold dollars, which we now have
permanently, from the trade of the country and greatly decrease our per
capita circulation. It is not proposed by the Republican party to take
from the circulating medium of the country any of the silver we now have.
On the contrary, it is proposed to keep all of the silver money now in cir
culation on a parity with gold by maintaining the pledge of the Govern
ment that all of it shall ba equal to gold.
Tois has been the unbroken policy of the Republican party since 1875.
It has inaugurated no new policy. It will keep in circulation and as good
as gold all of the silver and paper money which are now included in the
currency of the country. It will maintain their parity. It will preserve
their equality in the future as it has always done in the past. It will not
consent to put this country on a silver basis, which would inevitably
follow independent free coinage at a ratio of 16 to 1. It will oppose the .
expulsion of gold from our circulation.
If there is any one thing which should be free from speculation and
fluctuation is is the money of a country. It ought never to be the subject
of mere partisan contention. When we part with our labor, our products,
or our property, we should receive in return money which is as stable and
unchanging in value as the ingenuity of honest men can make it. De
basement of the currency means destruction of values. No one suffers so
much from cheap money as the farmers and laborers. They are the first
to feel its bad effects and the last to recover from them. This has been
the uniform experience of all countries and here, as elsewhere, the poor,
and not the rich, are always the greatest sufferers from every attempt to
debase our money. It would fall with alarming severity upon investments
already made, upon insurance companies and their policy-holders, upon
savings banks and their depositors, upon building and loan associations
and their members, upon the savings of thrift, upon pensioners and their
families and upon wage-earners and the purchasing power of their wages.
UNLIMITED, IRREDEEMABLE PAPER MONEY.
The silver question is not the only issue affecting our money in the
pending contest. Not content with urging the free coinage of silver, its
strongest champions demand that our paper money shall be issued di
rectly by the Government of the Unked States. This is ihe Chicago Demo
cratic declaration. The St. Louis People's party declaration is that "Our
National money shall be issued by the General Government only, without
the intervention of banks of issue, be full legal tender for the payment of
all debts, imblic and private," and.be distributed "directly to the people and
through lawful disbursements of the Government." Thus, in addition to
the free coinage of the world's silver, we are asked to enter upon an era of
unlimited, irredeemable paper currency. The question which W3S fought
out from 1865 to 1879 is thus to be reopened, with all,its uncertainties, and
cheap-money experiments of every conceivabie form foisted upon us.
This indicates a most startling reactionary policy, strangely at variance
with every requirement of sound finance, but the declaration shows the
spirit and purpose of those who by combined action are contending for the
control of the Government. Not satisfied with the debasement of our
coinage, which would inevitably follow the free coinage of silver at 16 to 1,
they would still further degrade our currency and threaten the public
honor by the unlimited issne of an irredeemable paper currency. A
graver menace to our financial standing and credit could hardly be con
ceived, and every patriotic citizen should be aroused to promptly meet and
effectually defeat it.
It is a cause for painful regret and solicitude that an effert is being
made by those high in the counsels of the allied parties to divide the peo
ple of this country into classes and create distinctions among us, which,
in fact, do not exist and are repugnant to our form of government. These
appeals to passion and prejudice are beneath the spirit and intelligence of
a free people, and should be met with stern rebuke by those they are
sought to influence; and I believe they will be. Every attempt to array
class against class, "the classes against the masses, section against sec
tion, labor against capital, the poor against the rich," or interest against
interest in the United States is in the highest degree reprehensible. It is
opposed to the National instinct and interest, and should be resisted bj
every citizen. We are not a Nation of classes, but of sturdy, free, inde
pendent, honorable people, despising the demagogue and never capitu
lating to dishonor. This ever-recurring effort endangers popular govern
ment, and is a menace to our liberties. It is not a new campaign device
or party appeal. It is as old as government among men, but was never
more untimely and unfortunate than now. Washington warned us against
it, and Webster said in the Senate in words which I feel are singularly
appropriate at tbis time:
"I admonish the people against tne object of outcries like these. I
admonish every industrious laborer of this country to be on his guard
against such delusion. I tell him the attempt is to play off his passion
against his interest, and to prevail on him, in the name of liberty, to de
stroy all the fruits of liberty."
PROTECTION OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE.
Another issue cf supreme importance is that of protection. The spirit
of free silver is a menace to be feared. We are already experiencing the
effect of partial free trade. The one must be averted, the other corrected.
The Republican party is wedded to the doctrine of protection, and
was never more earnest in its support and advocacy than now. If argu
ment were needed to stiengthen its devotion to the American system or
increase the hold of that system on the party and the people, it is found
in the lesson and experience of the past three years. Men realize in their
own daily lives what before was to many of them only report, history or
tradition. They have had a trial of both systems and know what each
has done for them.
Washington, in his farewell address September 17, 1796, a hundrd years
ago, said: "As a very important source of strength 1 and security cherish
public credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as pos
sible, avoiding the accumulation of debt, not only by shunaing occasions
of expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge tlie
debts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously
throwing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear."
To facilitate the enforcement, the maxims of which he announced, he
declared: "It is essential that you should practically bear in mind that
toward the payments of debts there must be revenue; that to have
revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised which are not
more or less inconvenient or unpleasant; that the intrinsic embarrassment
inseparable from the selection of the proper objects (which is always a
choice of difficulties) ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construc
tion of the conduct of the Government in making it, and for a spirit of
acquiescence in that measure ior obtaining revenues which the public
exigencies may at any time dictate."
Animated by like sentiments the people of the country must now face
the conditions which beset them. The "public exigencies" demand
prompt protective legislation, which will avoid the accumulation ot
further debt by providing adequate revenues for the expenses of the
Government. This is manifestly the requirement of duty. If elected
President of the United States it will be my aim to vigorously promote
this object and give that ample encouragement of the occupations of the
American people, whica. above all else, is so imperatively demanded at
this juncture of our National affairs.
OUR CONDITION IN DECEMBER, 1892.
In December, 1892, President Harrison sent his last message to Con
gress. It was an able and exhaustive review of the condition and
resources of the country. It stated our situation so accurately that lam
sure it will not be amiss to recite his official and valuable testimony.
"There has never been a time in our history," said he. "when work
was !>o abundant, or when wages were so high, whether measured by the
currency in which they are paid or by their power to supply the neces
saries and comforts of life. Tne general average of prices has been such
as to give agriculture a fair participation in the general prosperity. The
new industrial plaats established since October 6. 1890, and np to October
22, 1892, number 345, and the extension of existing plants 108. The new
capital invested amounts to $40,446,060, and the number of additional em
ployes 37,285. During the first six months of the present calendar year
135 new factories were built, of which forty were cotton mills, forty-eight
knitting mills, twenty-six woolen mills, fifteen silk mills, four plush mills
and two linen mills. Of the forty cotton mills, twenty-one have been built
in the Southern States. ''
This fairly describes the happy condition of |the country in December,
1892. What has it been since and what is it now?
The messages of President Cleveland from the oeginning of his second
administration to the present time abound with descriptions of tne de
plorable industrial and financial situation of the country. While no re
sort to history or official statement is required to advise us of the present
condition and that which has prevailed during the past three years, I ven
ture to quote from President Cleveland's first message, August 8, 1893, ad
dressed to the Fifty-third Congress, which he had called together in extra
ordinary session :
"The existence of an alarming and extraordinary business situation,"
said he, "involving the welfare and prosperity of all our people has con
strained me to call together in extra session the people's representatives
in Congress to the end that through the wise and patriotic exercise of the
legislative duties with which they solely are charged the present evils may
be mitigated and dangers threatening the future may be averted.
"Our unfortunate financial plight is not tne result of untoward events,
nor of the conditions related to our natural resources. Nor is it traceable
to any of the afflictions which frequently check National growth and
prosperity. With plenteous crops, with abundant promise of remunera
tive production and manufacture, with unusual invitation to safe invest
ment, and with satisfactory assurances to business enterprises, suddenly
financial distrust and fear have sprung up on every side. Numerons
moneyed institutions have suspended because abundant assets were not
immediately available to meet tne demands of frightened depositors.
Corporations and individuals are content to keep in hand the money they
are usually anxious to loan, and those engaged in legitimate business are
surprised to find that the securities they offer for loans, tfooug heretofore
satisfactory, are no longer accepted. Values supposed to be fixed are fast
becoming conjectural, and loss and failure have invaded every branch of
business."
THE CAUSE OF THE CHANGE.
What a startling and sudden change within the snort period of eight
monthsâ from December, 1892, to August, 1893! What had occurred? A
change of administrationâ all branches of the Government had been
intrusted to the Democratic party, which was committed against the
protective policy that Had prevailed uninterruptedly for more than thirty
two years and brought unexampled prosperity to the country, and firmly
pledged to its complete overthrow and the substitution of a tariff for
revenue only. The change having been decreed by the elections in
November, its effects were at once anticipated and felt. \Ve cannot close
our eyes to these altered conditions, nor would it be wise to exclude from
contemplation and investigation the cause which produced them. These
are the facts, which we cannot, as people, disregard, and we can only hope
to improve our present condition by a study of their cause.
In December, 1892, we had the same currency and practically the same
volume of currency that we have now. It aggregated in 1892 $2, 372,599, 501,
in 1893 |2,323 ,000..000, in 1894 $2,323,434,362 and in December, 1895,
$2,194,000,230. The per capita for the Nation, too, has been practically the
same during the whole period. The quality of money has been identical â
all kept equal to gold. There is nothing connected with our money
therefore to account for this sudden and aggravated industrial change.
Whatever is to be deprecated in our financial system, it must everywhere
be admitted that our money has been absolutely good, and has brought
neither loss nor inconvenience to its holders. A depreciated currency has
not existed to lurther vex the troubled business situation.
It is a mere pretense to attribute the hard times to the fact that all
our currency is on a god basis. Good money never made times hard.
Those who assert that our present industrial and financial depression is
the result of the gold standard have not read American nistory aright
or been careful students of the events of recent years. We never had
greater prosperity in this country in every field of employment and in
dustry than in the busy years from 1880 to 1892, during all of which time
this country was on a gold basis and employed more gold money in its
financial and business operations than ever before. We had, too, a protec
tive tariff, under which ample revenues were collected for the Government
and an accumulating surplus which was constantly applied to the pay
ment of the public debt. Let us hold fast to that which we know is good.
It is not more money we want; what we want is to put the money we
â  already have at work. When money is employed men are employed.
Both hare always been steadily and remuneratively engaged during the
years of protective tariff legislation. When those who have money lack
PRICE FIVE CENTS.2
confidence in the stability of values and mv stÂ»ents they will not part
with their money. Business is stagnant. The life blood of trade is
checked and congested. â 
WÂ« cannot restore the public confidence by an act which would revolu
tionize all values, or an act which entails a deficiency in the public rev
enues. We cannot inspire confidence by advocating repudiation or prac
ticing dishonesty. We cannot restore confidence either to tne treasury or
to the people without a change in our present tariff legislation.
THE TARIFF OF 1894.
The only measure of a general nature tniit affected the treasury and
the employments of our people, passed by t c i^ifty-third Congress, was
the general tariff act which did not receive the approval of the President.
Whatever virtues may be claimed for that act, there is confessedly one
which it does not possess. Ii lacks the essential virtue of its creationâ the
raising of revenue sufficient to suDply the needs of the Government. It
toas at no time provided enough revenue for such needs, but it has caused
a constant deficiency in the treasury and a steady depletion in the earn
ings of labor and land. It ha 3 contributed to swell our National debt
more than $262,000,000â a sura nearly as great as the debt of the Govern
ment from Washington to Lincoln, including all our foreign wars, from
the Revolution to the Rebellion. Since its passage work at home has
been diminished, prices of agricultural products have fallen, confidence
has been arrested and general bnsiness demoralization is seen on every
hand.
The total receipts under the tariff act of 1894, for the first twenty-two
months of its enforcement, from September, 1894, to June, 1896, were $557,
--(315,328, and the expenditures $640,418,363, or a deficiency of $82,803,035.
The decrease in our exports of American products and manufactures dur
ing the first fifteen months of the present tariff, as contrasted with the
exports of the first fifteen months of the tariff of 3890, was $220,353,320.
The excess of exports over imports daring the first fifteen months of the
tariff of 1890 was $213,972,968, but only $56,758,623 under the first fifteen
months of the tariff of 1894, a loss under the latter of $157,214,345. The
net loss in the trade balance of the United States has been $196,983,607 dur
ing the first fifteen months' operation of the tariff of 1894, as compared
with the first fifteen months of the tariff of 1890. The loss has been large,
constant and steady, at the rate of $13,120,000 per month, or $500,000 for
every business day of this year.
We have lost steadily ia both directions; our foreign trade has been
diminished and our domestic trade has suffered incalculable loss. Does
this not suggest the cause of our present depression and indicate its
remedy? Confidence in home enterprises has almost wholly disappeared.
Our shops are closed, or running on half time at reduced wages and small
profit, if not actual loss. Our men are idle, and while they are idle, men
abroad are occupied in supplying us with goods.
Our unrivaled borne market for the farmer has also greatly suffered
because those who constitute it â the great army of American wage
earners â are without the work aud wages they formerly had. if they can
not earn wages they cannot buy products. They cannot earn if they have
no employment, and when they don't earn the farmers' home market is
lessened and impaired, and the loss is felt by both producer and consumer.
The loss of earning power alone in this country in the past three years is
sufficient to bave produced our unfortunate business situation, if our
labor was well employed, and employed at as remunerative wages as in 1892,
in a few months every farmer in the land would feel the glad change in
the increased demand for his products and in the better prices v'hich he
would receive.
NOT OPEN MINTS, BUT OPEN MILLS.
It is not an increase in the volume of money which is the need of the
time, but an increase in the volume of business; not an increase of coin
but an increase of confidence; not more coinage, but a more active use of
the money coined; not open mints for the unlimited coinage of the silver
of the world, but open mills for the full and unrestricted labor of Ameri
can workingmen. The employment of our mints for the coinage of silver
would not bring the necessaries and comforts of life back to our people.

W. Gordon of Illinois and D. D. Wcod
nianseeof Ohio â the latter an old league
man, the former a recent worker in the
ranks.
Woodmansee was elected by the very
close vote of 810 to 804. Besides being un
expected, this result is believed to be dis
appointing to the National Republican
Campaign Committee.
The proposition for biennial sessions
was shelved, and the free coinage of silver
was not mentioned, except to be con
demned. Following is the platform :
We heartily Indorse the platform adopted at
St. Louis by the National Republican Conven
tion, June 17, 1596. The Republican party
was right when it elected Abraham Lincoln.
It was right in its effort to save the Union. It
-was right when it struck the chains from 4,
--000,000 of slaves and made tnem free men. It
was right in carrying into successful opera
tion the resumption of specie payments. It was
right in matins? protection to American In
dustries a cardinal doctrine of the American
people. It wag right in insisting that reci
procity should become the permanent law of
t be land.
It is right now and always has been right In
advocating a safe and stable currency, worth
its face the world over, whether In the hands
of the rich or poor. It was right wbeu it con
fided in the leadership of Grant, Hayes, Gur
fleld, Arthur and Harrison. It was right
â¢when it nominated William McKinley of
Ohio and Garret A. Hobart of New Jersey, and
we pledge them our hearty and loyal supoort.
We believe that a return to the Republican
policy of protection is as essential to the sol
vency of the Nation as is the maintenance of
the present financial standard to her credit
and her honor. A cheap dollar means low
wages, a financial panic, distress to the poor,
obligations repudiated, a dishonored country,
a blot on our fair history. The Republican
party stands lor honest money, honest treat
ment of our country's defenders, an honest
system of revenue, protecting our industries
and producing sufficient income to conduct
the affairs of the Nation, an bonest system of
exchange with foreign countries as embodied
in the reciprocity Idea of the immortal Blame,
an honest administration of public affairs.
The name of its candidate is synonymous
with honesty, patrioiism, statesmanship and
the highest ideal oi lifeâ duty and govern
ment. Our policies and candidates inspire
the stuae at, quicken tne best thought of the
voter, elevate the citizen and add new luster
to our country's history.
Thf second day's proceedings began at
11:25 o'clock. Secretary Dowling read the
following paragraph in a letter from John
A. Dewees, Denver, Colo., a member^of the
executive committee from Colorado,
which was received with appiause:
We are getting well organized out here and
have nearly all of the old workers back in the
ranks, as one by one they are beginning to see
their mistake in following after r rank folly.
R. J. Wood of South Dakota reported
from the committee on credentials that
the States and Territories and the College
Republican Club League were entitled to
delegates as follows: Each State and Ter
ritory, four from each Congressional .dis
trict and ten at large; the College League,
one delegate from each State in whicu it
is organized.
Among the States ><nd Territories not
represented in the convention were Col
orado, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Washing
ton, Indian Territory, Alaska and New
Mexico.
Mr. Crawford of Kentucky, chairman of
the committee on rules, reported tue
recommendations of that committee,
which provided that the entire vote of the
State be cast by the delegates present.
These reports were adopted.
Mr. Mclntyre, chairman of the com
mittee on ieague work, reported orally
what had been done in the past vvear, a
formal report to be made to the executive
committee.
The committee on resolutions not being
ready to report, the convention proceeded
to the election of a president. General
McAlpin retired from the platform and
Timothy E. Byrnes of Minnesota took the
chair. When California was reached in
the call of States for the presentation of
candidates she gave way to Illinois, and
Mr. Calhoun of that State named Charies
U. Gordon.
The nomination of Gordon was seconded
by delegates from Kansas, lowa, Mary
land, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New
Jersey, Oreeon, South Dakota, Texas,
Wyoming. West Virginia, Wisconsin (in
part).
D. D. Woodmansee of Ohio was pre
sented by Webster Davis of Missouri,
whose eloqnent tribute to the qualities of
the candidate was followed by a great
outburst of applaiue. The nomination
was seconded by delegates from Kentucky,
Louisiana, New York, Delaware. Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Indiana, Wisconsin (in
part) and the College Club League.
While the balloting was in progress the
votes of several States and Territories was
questioned by the advocates of Woodman
see's election, amid considerable excite
ment. No action, however, was tauen
until the rollcall had been completed,
when it was seen that the vote was so close
that a change of a State or two would
change the result.
A delegate from Ohio challenged the
right of the gentlemen who had cast the
votes of West Virginia and Arizona on the
ground that they were not residents of the
State and the Territory respectively. After
much confusion the vote of West Virginia
in favor of Gordon was permitted to stand
and the vote of Arizona was rejected.
This, together with other changes,
elected Mr. Woodmansee. Nebraska's
thirty-four votes, first cast for Gordon,
were counted thirty for Woodmansee and
four for Gordon, with the statement that
while Nebraska desired Gordon's election
it could not consent that it be secured by
unfair means. The vote resulted, Wood
mansee 810, Gordon 804.
On behalf of Gordon's supporters, Mr.
Yates of Illinois moved that Woodman
see's election be made unanimous.
Adopted.
In returning thanks for the election
Woodmansee said he was probably the
most surprised man in the hall. He had
not prepared a speech of acceptance, as he
had hardly deemed it necessary.
Wisconsin named D. C. Owen as a can
didate for the position of secretary against
M. J. Dowling, presented by Minnesota.
Mr. Dowling was elected by a nearly unan
imous vote, Owen receiving but 190 10 his
1288.
The report of the committee on resolu
tions was read by Secretary Dowling and
adopted.
Resolutions of thanks to the retiring
president. General McAlpin, and to the
committees which arranged the meeting,
were adopted.
Melville Hayes of Ohio reported rec
ommending that the next convention
be held in Detroit, the second Tuesday in
.July, 1897. Adopted.
A resolution, Introduced by M. Kelsey
of Michigan, recommending the incor
poration of clubs of commercial travelers,
as auxiliary to the National organization,
was referred to tnÂ« executive committee.
At 4 o'clock the convention adjourned
until 8 p. m., the evening session to be a
public mass-meeting.
At to-night's meeting brief speeches
were made by President Woodmansee,
Alden Smith of Michigan, Charies G.
Dawes of Michigan, Hon. F. X. Schoon
maker of New Jersey and Mrs. J. EUeu
Foster of lowa.
The members of the executive com
mittee present in Milwaukee decided to
night to start to-morrow for Canton to
visit Major McK.nley.
WISCO NSIN GOLD MEN.
Senator filer* I'rrnide* Over a Sound-
Money Democratic Convention.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Aug. 26.â A1l the
prominent leaders of the sound-money
Democracy in the Btate were present to
day when the State convention was
called to order by Ellis B. Usher of La
Crosse. J. H. Brennan of Stevens Point
was elected temporary chairmau and Sen
ator Vilai permanent chairman. Both
made long addresses, and after the usual
committees were appointed a recess was
taken until 2p. si. At the afternoon ses
sion General Bragg read the platform and
recommended its adoption with an elo
quent speech.
The resolutions adopted as the views of
the convention the declaration of the
National Uemocratic platform ot 1892 on
the money question.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 27, 1896.
This wiil only come with the employment of the masses, and such employ
ment is certain to follow the re-estaolisliment of a wise protective policy
which shall encourage manufacturing at home.
Protection bai lost none of its virtue and importance. The first duty
of the Republican party, if restored to power in the country, will bo the
enactment of a tariff law which will raise all the money necessary to con
duct the Government, economically and honestly administered, and so
adjusted as to give preference to home manufactures and adequate protec
tion to home labor and the lionie market.
We are not committed to any special schedules or rates of duty. They
are and should be always subject to change, to meet new conditions, but
the principle upon which rates of duly are imposed are almost the same.
Our duties should always be high enough to measure the difference between
the wages paid labor at home and in competing countries, and to ade
quately protect American investments and American enterprises.
Our farmers nave been hurt by the changes in our tariff legislation as
severely as our laborers and manufacturers, badly as they have suffered.
The Republican platform wisely declares in favor of such encouragement
to our sugar interests as will lead to the production on American soil of all
the sugar which the American people use. It promises to give our wool
and woolen interests "the most ample protection," a guaranty that ought
to commend itself to every patriotic citizen.
Never was a more grievous wrong done the farmers of our country
tnan that &o unjustly inflicted during the past three years upon the wool
growers of America. Although among our most industrious and useful
citizens, their interests have been practically destroyed and our woolen
manufacturers involved in similar disaster. At no time within the past
thirty-six years, and perhaps never during any previous period, have so
many of our woolen factories been suspended as now. The Republican
party can be relied upon to correct these great wrongs, if again intrusted
with the control of Congress.
RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER NATIONS.
Another declaration of the Republican platform that has my most
cordial support is that which favors reciprocity. The splendid results of
the reciprocity arrangements that were made under the authority of the
tariff law of 1890 are striking and suggestive. The brief period they were
in forceâ in most cases only three years â was not long enough to thor
oughly test their great value, but sufficient was shown by the trial to con
clusively demonstrate the importance and the wisdom of their adoption.
In 1892 the export trade of the United States attained the highest
point in our history. Tbe aggregate of our exports that year reached the
immense sum of $1,030,278,148, a sum greater by $100,000,000 than any pre
vious year. In 1893, owing to the threat of unfriendly tariff legislation,
the total dropped to $847,655,194. Our exports of domestic merchandise
decreased $189,000,000, but reciprocity still secured us a large trade in Cen
tral and South America, and &. larger trade with the West Indies than we
had ever before enjayed. The increase of trade with the countries with
which we had reciprocity agreements was $3,560,515 over our trade in 1892
and $16,440,721 over^cJur trade in 1891. The only countries with which the
United States traded that showed increased exports in 1893 were practi
cally those with which we had reciprocity arrangements.
The reciprocity treaty between tnis country and Spain, touching the
markets of Cuba and Porto Rico, was announced September 1, 1891. The
growth of our trade with Cuba was phenomenal. In 1891 we sold that
country but 114,441 barrels of flour; in 1892. 366,175; in 1893, 616,406, and
in 1894, 662,248. Here was a growtn of nearly 500 per cent, while our ex
portations of flour to Cuba for tfce year ending June 30, 1895Â»-the year fol
lowing the repeal of the reciprocity treatyâ fell to 379,826 barrels, a loss of
nearly half of our trade with that country. The value of our total exports
of merchandise in the United States to Cuba in 1891â the year prior to the
negotiation of the reciprocity treatyâ was $12,224,888; in 1892, $17,953,579;
in 1893, $24,157,698; in 1894, $20,125,321. But in 1895. after the arraullment
of the reciprocity agreement, it fell to only $12,887,661.
Many similar examples might be given of our increased trade under
reciprocity with other countries, but enough has been shown of the efficacy
NEW YORK REPUBLICANS
Nominate Congressman Frank
S. Back of Troy for
Governor.
Timothy F. Woodruff for Lieutenant.
Governor and Irving C Vann
for Appellate Judge.
SARATOGA, N. V., Aug. 26.â The sin
cerity of Thomas C. Platt was quickiy
verified to-day when the Republican State
Convention trot down to business. The
Republican leader strictly adhered to his
declaration that he was not a candidate,
and tne following ticket was nominated
with practically little friction. For Gov
ernor, Congressman Frank 8. Black of
Troy; Lieutenant-Governor, Timothy V.
Woodruff of Brooklyn; Judge of tbe

The convention reassembled at 11:45
o'clock, and the rollcall on nomination

The third ballot was without result, and
the fourth was ordered. As it proceeded

Edward Lauterbach arose' amid great
cheering, and cast the total 134 votes for
Black. The vote of New York gave Black
a majority of the total vote and the nomi
nation. The official vote was : Votes cast

TEACHERS AT CANTON.
A Delegation of 800 Call Upon the
future President.
CANTON, : Ohio, Aue. 26.â Major Mc-
Kinley this afternoon ' received a delega
gatlon composed of 200 of the Teachers'.
Association of Stark â  and surrounding
counties, which is in V convention here.
They surrounded the bouse and united in
singing" America." This brought the major
out, ; and after addresses by C. L. Hiner
and J. H. Carver, the latter payine a beau
tiful tribute to the major's sister, who was
for -.'thirty years a teacher here. Major Mo
KinJey responded in part as follows:
"Mr. ; Hiner, ladies and â¢ gentlemen: I
cannot permit to pass ' unnoticedâ for I
was . deeply moved- ,by â¢ it â the - beautiful
tribute paid by Mr. Carver to a member of
my own family and one whom I dearly
loved. Her splendid work is â¢; to â me : a
sweet and perpetual memory, and I grate
fully acknowledge the influence she ex
erted upon my life. v Her noble example
has been to me a constant inspiration.
That the Board â¢- of Education of Canton
should have *so honored her memory is
most gratifying to her family and friends."
"I have 'i great \ and ; : increasing respect
for â ) the schoolmaster. My ; ; great-grand
father was a ; teacher ;r of j a private
school in New Lisbon, Columbia County,
this State, long before the public ; school
system was established,; and since that
time some member of the family has been
engaged in that honorable occupation. As
J said I have always felt the greatest re
spect for the | schoolmaster, and | now and
then i; possibly : a: i fear of / him : (laughter],
still my earliest ' and *p! easa test recollec
tions are associated i with him, and ; I bear
him only gratitude and .j love. In early
days as now he was the conspicuous fie ure
of the legislation of 1890 to justify the speedy restoration of it 3 reciprocity
provisions. In ray judgment Congress should immediately restore the
reciprocity sections of the law, with such amendments, if any, as time and
experience sanction as wise and proper. The underlying principle of this
legislation must, however, be strict! y observed. It is to afford new mar
kets for our surplus agricultural and manufactured products, without loss
to the Anierica*n laborer of a single day's work that he might otherwise
procure.
The declaration of the platform touching foreign immigration is one
of peculiar importance at this time, when our own laboring people are in
such great distress. lam in hearty sympathy with the present legislation
restraining foreign immigration and favor such extension of the laws as
will secure the United States" from invasion by the debased and criminal
classes of the Old World.
While we adhere to the public policy under which our country has
received great bodies of honest, industrious citizens, who have added to
the wealth, progress and power of the country, and while we welcome iO
our shores the well-disposed and industrious immigrant, who contributes,
by his energy and intelligence, to the cause of free government, we want
no immigrants who do not seek our shores to become citizens. We should
permit none to participate in the advantages of our civilization who do
not sympathize with our aims ana form of government. We should wel
come none who come to make war on our institutions, and prone by public
disquite and turmoil. Against all such our gates must be tightly closed.
SOLDIERS, SAILORS, MARINE AND NAVY.
The soldiers and sailors of the Union should neither be neglected nor
forgotten. The Government, which they served so well, must not make
their lives or condition harder by treating them as supplicants for relief in
old age or distress, nor regard with disdain or contempt the earnest inter
est one comrade naturally manifest? in tne welfare of another. Doubtless
there have been pension abuses and frauds in the numerous claims allowed
by the Government, but the policy governing the administration of the
Pension Bureau must always be fair and liberal. No deserving applicant
should ever suffer because of a wrong perpetrated by or for another.
Our soldiers and sailors gave the best they had. They freely offered
health, strength, limb and life to save the country in the time of its great
est peril, and the Government must honor them in their need as in their
service with the respect and gratitude due to brave, noble and self-sacri
ficing men who are justly entitled to generous aid in their increasing ne
cessities.
The declaration of the Republican platform in favor of the upbuilding
of our merchant marine has my hearty approval. Tne policy of discrim
inating duties in favor of our shipping whicn pravailed in the early years
of our history should be again promptly adopted by Congress and vigor
ously supported until our prestige and supremacy on the seas is fully at
tained. We should no longer contribute directly or indirectly to the
maintenance of the colossal marine of foreign countries, but provide an
efficient and complete marine of our own now that the American navy is
assuming a position commensurate with our importance as a nation, a
policy I am glad to observe the Republican platform strongly indorses.
We must supplement it with a merchant marine that will give us the ad
vantages in both our coastwise and foreign trade that we ought naturally
and properly to enjoy. It should be at once a matter of public policy
and National pride to repossess this immense and prosperous trade.
The pledge of the Republican National Convention that our civil ser
vice laws "shall be sustained and thoroughly and honestly enforced and
extended wherever practicable" is in keeping with the position of the
party for the past twenty-four years, and will be faithfully observed. Our
opponents decry these reforms. They appear willing to abandon all the
advantages maintained after so many years' agitation and effort. They
encourage a return to methods of party favoritism which both parties
bave often denounced, that experience has condemned and that the people
have repeatedly disapproved.
in the community, commanding the con
fidence and often winning the affection of
both pupils and parents. The teacher
ordinarily was the ideal of the pupil. In
him was embodied all that was eood and
true and great, and this was always true
when the pupil loved ttie teacher.
"As 1 look back upon my schooldays I
grow in the conviction that my best
teachers were not the most agreeable
teachers. [Laughter.] I have come to
realize that what was less attractive to me
was most important to my education. If
you have a deep interest in youV country,
if you would show your love for your
country you must give considerable atten
tion to American policies.
"While this call is without any political
significance, it is at least an assurance
that your minds are not wholly absorbed
with literary pursuits, but that now and
then they are turned to considerations of
a political character. The duties of citi
zenship are quite as high and important
as any which can engage our attention,
and the educated man of the country
should be the last to overlook and neg
lect them.
"The teacher is tbe public servant. He
is not in private employment. He is an
essential part of the conservative force
which upholds the National fabric. He
instructs the future citizen and future
statesman. He is a mighty power in the
life of the Nation. His influence has uni
formly been on tbe side of right. He
molds and directs the minds which will
control the destiny of the republic. Gen
tlemen, you are engaged in a noble call
ing. I honor you in your service and
profession. Nothing more exalted could
engage you. The youth are yours to
train. The youth of the land are yours to
instruct. That it may be wisely done you
have my best wishes and prayers. I shall
be glad to meet and greet each and every
one of you personally." [Applause.]

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
IOWA GOLD DEMOCRATS,
They Indorse Cleveland and
Denounce the Chicago
Platform.
Delegates to the Indianapolis Conven
t on Withcut a Suspicion of
Populism
DES MOINES, lowa, Aug. 26.â The
largest Demociatic convention that has
been held in lown in three years was the
gathering of the National Democracy to
day to select, delegates to the Indianapolis
convention. It was a Democratic conven
tion without a suspicion of the Populism
which has been the characteristic of Dem
ocratic conventions for two years. It em
phatically denounced tlie Chicago plat
form, indorsed Cleveland and reiterated
the principles of the National Democracy
of Jackson, Jefferson and Tiiden in a ring
ing platform. J. E. Markley was tempo
rary chairman and made a strong speech.
The permanent chairman was Judge W.
I. Babb, who only a year ago was made
the unanimous nominee of the lowa
Democracy for Governor. His speech was
a long and able exposition of the essential
differences between the principles of true
Democracy and those enunciated at
Chicago, and was vigorously applauded.
Mr. Markley's was the most eloquent,
however, and resulted in breaking the
slate and nominating him unanimously,
in the face of his declination, for elector at
large, W. W. Witnier of Dcs Moines being
his running mate.
For delegates at large to Indianapolis
there were so many aspirants that the con
vention named eight and gave them half
a vote each. Tney are: W. I. Babb,
JosÂ»ph Eiboeck, William Groneweg, John
Cliggett, L. M. Martin, M. B. Hendricks,'
Joel Stewart and H. H. Trimble. The
only jar in the convention waa wnen a
resolution was presented declaring it the
sense of the convention that every sound
money Democrat should vote against any
Congressional candidate who does not
pledge himself Xo oppose the free coinage
of silver at 16 to 1. It had been decided
that the State or Congressional tickets
would be named by the National Democ
racy, and when this resolution was pre
sented Chairman Babb ruled that the State
convention had no authority over Con
gressional matters, and therefore it was
out of order. There was no opposition to
tne ruling.
The platform reiterates the principles
recognized as those of Democracy; de
clare^ that the Chicago convention sur
rendered these and declared for a new sec
tionalism, of the West and South against
the East and North; declares that the Chi
cago platform is mischievous in its ten
dencies and a menace to free government.
It denounces the Chicago attitude toward
Cleveland, whom it eulogizes. The at
tack on the judiciary is denounced, and
the attitude of the Chicago gathering on
money is discussed at some length. The
declaration on this subject is in substance
as follows:
Tliat platform threatens to debase the
coinage through unlimited coinage of
silver at an arbitrary and fictitious ratio.
It virtually pledges, if placed in power,
to repeal the act for resumption of specie
payment. These are not Democratic prin
ciples and cannot receive our support.
The election of a President pledged to
these principles will precipitate a finan
cial crisis whose consequence cannot be
predicted. We favor use of gold and
silver, maintained at parity; we adhere
to the gold standard until true bimetallism
can be achieved. We demand a reorgan
ization of present financial laws, especi
ally those which compel the issue of Gov
ernment bonds to maintain National
credit. We reaffim the past declarations
of the party on the tariff and on State
issues.
The State Central Committee met after
the convention ana decided to open head
quarters and conduct an active speaking
and literary campaign in the State.
MICHIGAN FOR GOLD.
Gold Democrat* t.lect Delegate* to the
Jndiannpoli* Convention.
LANSING, Mich., Aug. 26.â The gold
Democrats in convention to-day nomi
nated a complete State and electoral
ticket and provided for full representation
The Republican party earnestly opposes this reactionary and entirely
unjustifiable policy. It will take no backward step upon this question.
It will seek to improve, but never degrade the public service.
There are other important and timely declarations m the plat
form which I canr.ot here discuss. I must content myself witn saying
that they have my approval. If, as Republicans, we have lately addressed
our attention with what may seem great stress and earnestness to the new
and unexpected assault upon the financial integrity of the Government,
we have done it because the menace is so grave as to demand especial
consideration, and because we are convinced tha. if the people are aroused
to the true understanding and meaning of this silver an, inflation move
ment they will avert the danger. In doing this, we fee that we render the
best service possible to the country, and we appeal to the intelligence,
conscience and patriotism of the people, irrespective of party or section,
for their earnest support.
IT WILL MAINTAIN LAW AND ORDER.
We avoid no issues. We meet tl.e sadden, dangerous and revolu
tionary assault upon law and order and upon those to whom is confided
by the constitution and laws the authority to uphold and maintain them
which our ooponent. bave made with the same courage that we faced
every emergency since our organization as a party more than forty years
ago. Government by law must first be assured; everything else can wait.
The spirit of lawlessness must be extinguished by the fires of an unselfish
and lofty patriotism. Every attack upon the public faith and even sug
gestion of the repudiation of debts, public or private, must be rebuked by
all men who believe that honesty is the best policy, or who love their
country and would preserve unsullied its iNational honor.
The country ia to be congratulated upon the almost total obliteration
of the sectional lines which for so many years marked the division of the
United State* into slave and free territory, and finally threatened its par
titioninto two separate governments by the dread ordeal of civil- war.
The era of reconcilation, so lon* and earnestly desired by General Grant
and many other great leaders. North and South, has happily come, and
the feeling of distrust and hostility between the sections is everywhere
vanishing*; let us hope never to return.
Nothing is better calculated to eive strength to the Nation at home,
increaÂ»e our power and influence abroad and add to the permanency and
security of our free institutions than the restoration of cordial relations
between the peoole of all sections and parts of our beloved country. If
called by the suffrage of the people to assume the duties of the high office
of President of the United "States I snail count it a privilege to aid, even
in the slightest degree, in the promotion of the spirit of fraternal regard
â which should animate and govern tae citizens of every section, State or
part of the Republic. After the lapse of a century since its utterance, let
us at length and forevar after need the admonition of Wasdington:
"There should De no North, no South, no East, no West, but a com
mon country."
It shall be my constant aim to improve every opportunity to advance
the cause of Government by- promoting that spirit of forbearance and jus
tice which is so essential to our prosperity and happiness by joining most
heartily in all proper efforts to restore the relations of brotherly respect
and affection which in our early history characterized all the people of the
States. 1 would be *lad to contribute toward binding into indivisible
union the different divisions of the country, which, indee^l, now "have
every inducement of sympathy ana interest," to weld them together more
strongly than ever. 1 would rejoice to see demonstrated to the world that
the North and the South and the East and the West are not separated
or in danger of becoming separated because of sectional or party
differences.
The war is long since over; "we are not enemies, but friends," and as
friends we will faithfully and cordially co-operate under the approving
smile of Him who has thus far so signally sustained and guided us, to pre
serve inviolate our country's name and honor, its peace and good order,
and its continued ascendency among the greatest Governments on earth.

;':MEN OF INDUSTRY WHO STAND BY McKINLEY.
Representatives of every calling to which men devote time and energy to provide
for their families and secure for themselves the necessities and luxuries that honest
labor affords, were interviewed yesterday as to why they were Republicans and why
they intend to vote next November for McKinley and Hobart.
Of those interviewed all declared their sole reason for casting their rote for
McKinley was the fact that their votes would be drops in the bucket to make up the
plenitude of protection. "Protection," they said, "will stimulate industry. It will
set in motion the machinery of factories that has long been idle. It will give the
mechanic work to do; it will help to raise wages; it will bring more money into
the stores, because when prosperity reigns the workingman, of whatever craft he may
be, will spend his money and receive therefor comforts and necessities."
NO MORE DEMOCRACY.
J. McCOY has been a Democrat since he was old enough to cast his first vote,
has never in his life voted for any
Bother than a Democratic Presidential
I nominee. His occupation is that of an
Hironmolder and he is employed in that
I capacity Dy the firm of O'Connell &
H Lewis.
"This year I am going to cast my first
I vote for a Republican nominee for Presi-
I dent," ne declared. "Major McKinley is
I the man in my estimation who represents
I the best interests of the laboring classes.
"My reason in brief for thus voting is,
I protection is the only thing that will
I draw this country from the slough of
I despondency. Business in my line has
I been going down hill for the past four
I years. We never had such hard times
Bunder a Republican administration, and
I especially under the McKinley bill.
"As regards the money question, I am
I for a bimetallic standard, but I do not be-
I lieve it can ever be bad, except by inter-
I national agreement. We are not ready
I for it yet anyhow, and the financial policy
I adopted by the Democratic party can re-
suit in nothing but chaos. lam conser
vative myself, and when I look around me and see men idle and begging for a chance
to earn bread for their families I cannot help but conclude that something is 'rotten
in Denmark.' If McKinley be elected I shall confidently look forward to the time
when the country will be as prosperous as it was before the 'Stuffed Prophet 1 began
his despotic career."
J. W. RAPHAEL'S IDEAS.
'â¢I believe the country will thrive under a protective system," said J. W. Raphael
"that will open our mills and give employ-^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^l
merit to our wage-makers.
"If McKinley is elected I think thereH
will be a restoration of confidence, andH
upon this hinges the investment of capital.
Capital is timid at the best. If there is al
lack of confidence naturally investmentÃ
ceases until it is determined if it ia safe to^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B
invesL^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H
"The principal thing to-day is to protect
our own industries so that employment
may be given to American labor. The
money question is only a snare and a de
lusion. The thing is to give the wage
earner a chance to earn money. There is
ample money in the country. It has been
hoarded up, and till the people, the
capitalists, are assured that an investment
is safe, there will be ne revival of indus
tries.
"I shall vote for McKinley. We do not,
however, influence the men in our em
ploy; they may vote for whoever they
choose.
"Regarding the money question. To
lift the whole thing down, only 8 per cent
of the business of the United States is transacted with coin; 92 per cent of it is with
checks and bills of exchange. But what seems to me paramount to all other things
in the campaign is to give the workmen steady employment. Let him earn the dollar
and let him have it in his pocket. I believe the Republican platform has in it the
ingredients of prosperity.
"What we Californians want to do is to expand our commerce and make San
Francisco a great manufacturing City. We want the commerce of the Pacific. What
we produce we should find a market for. Instead of dumping our fruits in the bay
we should dry, can and ship them to the Orient. The young merchants of our City
ihould look to this. We must reach out for more trade and tatce up the task un
completed by James G. Blame â reciprocity with all countries contiguous witlx
our own."
IT WILL HELP DRY GOODS.
"So far as the dry-goods business is concerned," said Marshall Hale, "the tariff
directly affects the trade. Protection means protection to American industries. It
means to give the infant industries of the United States a chance to grow and become
competitors of the markets of the world. Before the McKinley bill went into effect we
were importing a great many foreign goods. After its passage we bought at home.
Among the infant industries which were started there were velvet manufactories, ho
siery, dress goods, cassimeres and woolens of all kinds. Now we are forced again to
buy foreign goods. Instead of employing the laborers of the United States we are fill
ing the coffers of England, France and Germany. Everything is regulated by supply
and demand, and if the country be prosperous the people will bny more."

PROTECTION THE ISSUE.
W. H. PRICE is employed by ClabrouKh&Qolcherasagunsmith^PricehM
worked in many of the largest establish-
ments in the country. At the time the I
McKinley bill went into operation be was I
employed as expert gunsmith by a large I
manufacturer of guns.
"I am for McKinley," he stated empbati- I
cally. "Why? Simpiy because times were I
far better in my line of business when bis I
bill was in operation.
"That is the chief reason. I believe in & I
high protective tariff. While I was in I
Chicago the MtKinley bill was passed by I
Congress. Prior to that time the firm, in I
common with all others, had been obliged I
to manufacture the cheapest grade of guns I
to be had in order to make any sales at all. I
As soon as the bill was adopted we were I
able to turn out first-class guns and could I
get a fair price for them.
"As regards the currency question I do I
not deem myself well enough informed to I
speak, but on the one issue of protection I
alone I am in favor of McKinley, and I I
believe be will be the next President."
Mr. Price evidently had no doubt of the I
final result of the campaign. He claimed
that all people required was to think a little in order to vote for McKinley.
FROM A REAL-ESTATE MAN.
"I am a Republican," said J. J. McEWEN, "because I believe the protective ques
tion the most intelligent one before the public to-day. No more striking instance of
the fallacy of the so-called advantages if the reduction in tariff or free trade can be
cited than in the coal question. Under the Republican administration the Govern
ment received a duty of 75 cents a ton on all foreign coal brought into market. Our
Democratic friends held that if the duty were taKen off coal a^i manufacturing indus
tries concerned in its consumption would flourish. The Wilson tariff bill reduced the
tariff on coal 40 cents per ton, and what was the result? It cut no figure at all in the
price to the consumer. There was really a slight advance.
"The men of industry and means who start business enterprises and the wheels of
factories into motion have confidence in the Republican party. If the party succeeds
I look forward to a revival of industries and to general business prosperity."

"Four years ago," said W. H. Nolan, the shoeman, "on my trip around the world
in Smyrna, Turkey and Asia, my dragoman told me to be careful not to laud the
name of McKinley. 'They are all crying down McKinley,' said he, 'for he was the
cause of nearly all of the American carpet-buyers leaving this country.' The McKin
ley bill caused such high rates on carpets that it did not profit the American buyer to
go outside of his own country.
"I know that the McKinley bill has advanced the American interests iv the lines
of the carpet manufactures. If I had been a Democrat at tfcat time I should certainly
have turned Republican.
"In Singapore, Japan and Hongkong they all cry down McKinley, but Turkey
has the greatest hatred for him. I don't see how we are going to have gold or silver
without protection."
E. H. BLACK, painter and decorator, said: "If Bryan be elected we never will
have any good times. What I believe will
result if McKinley be elected will be the
ease and confidence with which money

"I can't see," said JOHN PETTY, the blacksmith, "that the silver proposition

JOHN VANCE is a carpenter who does odd jobs in the region of North Beach.
He was busily engaged sawing some boards when the question was asked him
as to his stand on the party issues before the people. Resting one hand on his knee
he quickly answered:
"I am for McKinley, of course. How could any man who earns bis bread by the
sweat of his brow be otherwise? Just answer that for me, if you can.
"Before Grover Cleveland went into office the last time I was able to earn $3 a
day right along. Now I sometimes make only half that sum and am out of work
most of the time. Yet ttiese Bryan men â they are devilish few at that â come up to
me and ask me to vote for free silver. I wouldn't vote for McKinley if he was for
free silver. Anything the Democrats favor seems to be a hoodoo to us, anyway. I
am not going to vote for a party that makes life a struggle for existence, not if
I know myself, and I am confident I do. I wish Cleveland's neck were under this
â¢aw now.
"What beats me is the way the Democrats make promises. They will make a
bushel to win one vote, fail to carry them out and then expect to gull a man again the
next election.
"They won't fool Vance, as they never have." and John picked up his saw and
went to work again.
J. 8. CONWELL, the bicycle-dealer, said: "I am a Republican because the best
thing in this world is an honest man and, next, an honest party. The Republicans
have never broken a pledge, therefore they are the honest party. This is generally
why I am a Republican.
"Specifically, a high protection is what we need. America should be for Ameri
cans. History has proved that high tariff is best for this country and a low tariff
best for foreign countries. lam a Republican because I want an honest dollar, and I
know of no mathematics by which you can make a foot rule of a six-inch stick. The
Democrats are holding out false hopes. I could give you many more reasons and
talk all day on the subject, but it seems to me that these are enough for anybody."

so many hundred, where under a protec

would be advanced, simply because there
would be a demand for It, and laboring
people, if all were employed, would create
this demand.

favor of assisting the laboring classes, and I believe protection the only thing that
will set them on their feet.
"I agree with McKinley on the financial question. I believe in souud money. If
any metal is to be made a standard let it be gold.
"I cannot say too much, however, in regard to the wool Industry. It is in every
State, and exceeds by many millions of dollars the silver question. By the tariff for
revenue only this industry has been made dormant, and it has changed consumers to
producers by driving the wooi-growers to farming. From this condition of affairs has
originated the aepressiou in prices."
ONLY FREE LUNCH NOW.
FRANK ROBINSON is employed as foreman in the lumber department of the
Bellingham Bay Improvement Company,
and is about as strong a Republican in his
condition ? Democrats rare now endeavor
ing to brins; us to a pass where a laborer will get only 20 cents a day, as they do in
Mexico. Some people are, going to be pretty badly surprised when this coming
election is over, I can tell you."
HE DISLIKES ALTGELD.
"Even if I were a Democrat," asserted D. R. HENSHELWOOD of the firm of DoÂ»nÂ«
& Henshelwood, "I would not vote theH
Democratic ticket at this particular time.H
"My reasons for this are various. i^H
the first place, the Democratic leader hasH
the scum of the country at his back.H
Wouldn't this be a beautifully governed I
Nation with Altgeld, say, for Secretary ofl
State and Debs for Secretary of War?H
Well, I should say it would!
"I am for Mr. McKinley, because heH
has the great mass of right-thinkingH
men at his back and because I believe theH
policy he has adopted is the only one that I
will save this country from disaster. â¢ I
"If Bryan be elected as the President ofH
these United States we shall occupy theH
same position as the poet so graphically^
ascribed to Rome â we shall stand 'theH
Kiobe of nations.' "
Mr. Henshelwood was very emphaticH
in his expressions. He seemed to be con-H
vinced that the only hope for the working- H
man lay in electing McKinley. He re "B
garded him not only as the stand ard-H
bearer of the Republican party, the apostleH
of protection and the exponent cf freej
labor, but also as the guardian of law and order and commercial stability. "Wbattha
country wants," said he, "is a man who will inspire confidence, and that man is
William McKinley."
A WAGON-MAKER'S VIEWS.
W. J. DARREN, who manufactures and repairs wagons and does general black
smithing, said : "I am for McKinley because McKinley is for protection. I will
cast my vote for nim, you may be assured. If materials from European ports are
cheaper than what we can make, our manufactures will certainly never be bought
nor made.
"The Republican administration will insist on a restricted immigration. At the
present time Japanese labor comes in here and works for 10 cents a day at the same
labor that our people get from $3 to $4 a day for. We can't compete with such
conditions.
"The great trouble at present is the lack of confidence. If McKinley gets into
office confidence will return, and with confidence will come prosperity.
"Our business is seriously affected at present because of this lack of confidence.
There is very little drayage at present, and consequently very little repairing
done. Draymen do not care to expend much money in fixing up their wagons,
because their small business makes it impossible. I was a Democrat last election,
but since then I have seen the ruinous effects of the Democratic policy and legislation.
There is no hope for prosperity but in McKinley ana protection. Protection is all a
man wants. We have no new work in our business at all to speak about. A man
can't feel justified in putting his money into new wagons or drays."
A GROCER'S FIDELITY.
A. QUADE, the grocer, said: "I Deneve in restriction and protection. I believe the
election of McKinley will brighten the basines3 condition of the country. This will
do it if anything can. My opinion is that if he be elected the financial part will regu
late itself. The money question is the hue and cry to get the vote of the laborer.
"Republicanism will help business in general, and therefore help my business.
The Government then will be placed ia a self-supporting condition, which it ii not
to-day."
sympathies as a man can well be. He
says a Bryan adherent is a marked man
in the region where he lives, a sort of
Ishmaelite as it were.
"I never was a Democrat," he said, "and
each succeeding year only tends to con
vince me that I am on the right path.
"When Cleveland went into office four
years ago Democrats promised us $4 a day
and roast beef. We are lucky to get $2 a
day and a free lunch. Times ate harder
than I ever expectea to see them in a
country so teeming with natural resources.
"Every day men come to me who were
howling for Cleveland and free trade four
years ago, and admit that I was right for
laughing at them then. They have now
come to the conclusion that the only safe
policy is a high protective tariff.
"As for the financial question, I regard
it as entirely nonsensical to advocate free
silver. Look at the countries where silver
monometallism prevails â what is their

BRYAN TOURS THE
EMPIRE STATE.
Weary and Husky He Is
Compelled to Speak
at Erie.
THOUSANDS GREET HIM.
Addresses Three Large Gather
ings After a Day of Travel
and Talking.
THE HAND-SHAKING FOLLOWS
Velli the People That Their Only
Salvation Is to Elect Him
President.
ERIE, Pa., Aug. 26.â Husky of voice
and tired of body, after a long and hard
day of campaigning, William Jennings
Bryan found himself confronted on Ins
arrival in Erie, at 7 o'clock to-night, with
â¢ programme calling for three more
speeches before he could rest from this
day of .railroad traveling and speech
making. But he carried out the part of
the contract assigned him by the local
committee ot arrangements and performed
his triple duty with a vigor that spoke
well for his constitution. His reception
at the railroaa station was hearty in the
extreme. Rain was falling when his train
arrived, but the 2000 or more people wait-
Ing his coming stood their ground and
gave the candidate a royal welcome.
Accompanied . by Hon. Joseph Bibley
and other prominent Democrats of Erie,
Mr. Bryan started out at 8 o'clock to per
form the contract which had been made
for him. The tnree gatherings which he
addressed repaid him in the potency of
their applause. , Bchlosser's Hall, the
scene of his first speech, seats 2500 people,
nnd to-night it was crowded. Numerous
farmers were present and Bryan made a
stirring speech suitable to the audience.
From Schlosset *s Hall Mr. Bryan was
whirled off to St. Patrick's Auditorium.
Here lie spoke with effort. The effect of
his two long addresses at Syracuse and
Rochester and his short speeches at a
number of places along the route to Erie
had begun to show, and Mr. Bryan's vocal
oigans appeared to bo in much the same
weakened state as they were on his arrival
in New York. Like' the crowds in the first
Brie meeting, thÂ« 2500 men and women
nssembled in the Auditorium were or
derly, but on the whole more enthusiastic
than those at the former place. The
three cheers they gave when the young
nominee concluded fairly shook the j
rafters.
Again the thoroughly fatigued candi- i
data was whirled away, this time to the
Park Opera-house, where the eighth an
nual State Convention of Pennsylvania
Democratic Clubs was in session. This
was the most demonstrative meeting of
the evening. When the prolonged shouts
of welcome had ended Mr. Bryan was in
troduced and made his most important
speech of the evening.
After he was through the nominee held {
a httmi -stinking reception ana went back
to the Heed House and to bed. His speech
was as follows:
Mr. Chairman, Ladle* and Gentlemen: let
teem it a great privilege to be permitted to
meet to-night with the members of the club
assembled here from all over the State of
Pennsylvania, because 1 know what these
meetings mean. I know the Inspiration that
they give ami of the enthusiasm carried back
bvtaoMWho go forth to prosecute the work
el this campaign.
in my Judgment we are entering upon a
campaign which will be memorable in the
history of the country for many reasons, not
only because of the issue Involvedâ would
be enough to make It an epoch in the history
of nationsâ but there are other reasons. This
campaign Will demonstrate as no campaign
has done within the last generation the
rapacity of the people for Belt-government.
{A voiceâ "A Daniel come to Judgment.")
Mr. Bryan, continuing, said:
Is there a man in this land who doubt* that
the American people can rise to the require*
ments of any emergency? 11 so, I bid him to
cast his eyes upon seventy million of people
thinking out their own salvation. [Great
applause.] Is there a man who believes that
party machinery can govern this people! '
I bid him look until he sees the great com
jnou people breaking every machine that
stands in their way. [Ore*', applause and
cheering. l Is there a man who believes that

Ah, come with me to the farm and I will !
Show you the man who follows the plow and
who has studied this money question, and
who knows if the dollars go up his wheat
comes down, and you cannot answer the logic
cf that argument at all. (Great applause.]
Continuing at some length, Mr. Bryan
said he wanted his opponents to under
stand that the fact that ne was a young
xaan did net mean tnat there was going to
be any child's play in this campaign; He
declared for an aggressive war against any
man who declared either for a gold stand*
Â»r\i or for foreign domination" In domestic
affairs, and wound up his speech by re
mart:
1 urge you to remerater that this cause rests

Mr. Bryan left Utlca at 7:21 o'clock this
xneruicf;. The ; first stop was -. at Roue,
where he spoke a few words. Short stops
*wfrÂ« also made at Out ids, Canistoga ; and
Kirkvillew â 
At Syracuse he was Â«reetcd by an im

xnesibers of the reception committee were
introduced to Mr. Bryan and a committee
of ladies took charge o! ; Mrs. Bryan. A
procession escorted the candidate to Han

hundred people were at the depot. In
respoase to cheers and the presentation of
a bouquet of dowers Mr. Bryan brieSy ac
knowiedged the compliment.
Rochester was reached at 2:15, where a
large crowd was present. Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan entered a carriage with some of the
reception committee, and with a big crowd
marching beside the carriage proceeded to
Brown Square, where at least 10,000 people
had gathered.
Frederick Cook, ex-Secretary of State,
presented Mr. Bryan, who was so hoarse
t li nt his voice could be heard scarcely a
hundred feet away, and this caused a
perceptible diminution of the crowd.
Mr. Hryan left for Buffalo on the Em
pire State express at 3:25 and urrived
there at 4:45. A reception committee,
consisting of Herman Â£. Mack of the
Buffalo Times, Judge Titus and others,
met Mr. Bryan at Rochester. There was
a large crowd on the platform, and they
gave him a routing cheer as he boarded
the special train which was to take him to

WILL BOMBARD ZANZIBAR.
English Give Said Kalid's Force Until
9 O'Clock This Morning to
Surrender.
ZANZIBAR, Aug. 26.â The belief here
is quite general that the death of the late
Sultan was caused by poison.
This evening an ultimatum was sent to
Said Kulid informing him that unless he
strikes his flag and makes a complete sur
render by 9 o'clock to-morrow the place
will be bombarded. All of the British
residents of the town have been requested
to go on board the warships lying in the
harbor by 8 o'clock to-morrow morning.
The force under Said Kalid numbers
2500 men, all well armod. The consensus
of opinion is that the action of Said Kalid
has furnished a favorable occasion for the
noisting of the British flag and the aboli
tion of Arab rule and slavery.
RIOT IN CONSTANTINOPLE
A Mob Armed With Revolvers
and Bombs Attacks the
Gendarmes.
Many Soldiers Killed and Wounded
by a Band of Desperate Rev
olutionists.
LONDON, Eno., Aug. 26.â A dispatch to
a local news agency from Constantinople
says:
Slobs are in possession of a large part of
Constantinople to-night. Early in the
afternoon a body of men armed with re
volvers and bombs invaded the Ottoman
Bank, killing a number of gendarmes on
guard. The employes of the bank fled to
the quarters occ ;>ied by the tobacco syn
dicate which has control of the collection
of the taxes on tobacco throughout the
empire.
The invaders mounted the roof of
the building, and from the open windows
tired at the police in the street below. They
returned tho fusillade, and several persons
were killed and wounded. Then the riot
became general. Shops were sacked and
bazars invaded, and the wildest excite
ment prevailed throughout certain quar
ters of Constantinople.
A later report says there Is no doubt
that the movement was revolutionary in
plan and scope; that it had its origin at
secret meetings of Armenians.
About forty of the rioters were still in
possession of the Ottoman Bank at a late
hour this evening, despite all the efforts
ol the Government forces to remove them.
Riots continue and the mobs are con
stantly increasing in the Galata quarter.
A bomb exploded in Constantinople
near the Gaiata guardhouse. Many sol*
iliers were killed and wounded. Her
Majesty's ship Dryad at once left The
rapia, where she was anchored, and pro
ceeded to this city. It is also expected
that the French and Italian xnardships
will reach Constantinople early in the
morning.

The Italian Charge d' Affaires has de

BIG DRY-GOODS
HOUSE ASSIGNS,
Hilton, Hughes & Co. Are
Unable to Meet Their
Obligations.
OVER A MILLION SHORT.
The Mammoth Concern Suc
cumbs to the Prevailing
Monetary Stringency.
STATEMENT OF THE ASSIGNEE.
Judge Hilton's Sacrifices to Sustain
the Firm Do Not Appease
the Creditors-
NEW YORK, N. V., Ang. 2aâ Hilton,
Hughes & Co., the dry-goods firm, as-
Bigned to-day. The following notice
posted on the doors of the big building at
Broadway and Ninth street, occupied by
Hilton, Hughes & Co., attracted a big
crowd on their way to business:
Hilton, Hughes <b Co. have discontinued
business and made a general assignment
without preference, to George M. Wright. All
employes are notified that their services are
no longer required and that they will De paid
In full to-day and including this day.
The store will remain closed until rurther
notice. If the services of any employes are
needed by the assignee, they will be notified.
Dated, August 26. Hilton, Hughes a Com
pany. Georoe M. Wright, Assignee.
The immediate cause of the failure is
ascribed to the fact that the firm carried
on its books over $1,000,000 worth of what
are yet considered high-class accounts.
These creditors are well-to-do uptown
people, who make it a point of settling
their bills once a year. Recent pressure
upon Hilton, Hughes <fe Co. and their in
ability to realize from outstanding ac
counts precipitated a crisis.
The liabilities are estimated all the way
from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000. In March
last the firm, according to Brad street's,
claimed assets of $3,363,000 and liabilities
of $1,230,000, leaving net assets of
$2,133,000.
George M. Wright, assignee, made the
following statement this afternoon:
"Parties in interest became satisfied that
the business was not making a profit. It
was therefore determined to close it. It
was at first supposed that this could be
done by an ordinary closing-out sale
without any general assignment. With
this end in view Judge Hilton within the
last month advanced $250,000 to the firm
t" pay on account of merchandise claims.
He has during the last few years ad
vanced very larsre sums.
"He would have been willing to advance
enough to pay all the unsecured claims,
but in the present monetary stringency it
is more than inconvenient to raise that
amount at once, though the sum is not
largeâ less than $600,000.
"Theexisting difficulties every merchant
and banker knows. As claims were press
ing there seemed to be no otner way to
close the business with equal justice to all
creditors and preserve the property from
sacrifice but a general assignment with
out preferences.
"It is oelieved that all the merchandise
and general debts can be paid in full out
of sales of the stock and the collection of
outstanding accounts. The bank paper
is secured and will of course all be paid.
"Negotiations are pending for the sale of
the whole stock, which, if carried through,
will result in a settlement of the debts in
a very short time."
George M. Wright, the assignee of Hil
ton, Hughes it Co., is a lawyer. He had
no connection with the firm, but is a
friend of ex-Judge Hilton.
The firm of Hilton, Hughes A Co. is one
of the largest and best Known in the retail
dry-goods trade. They did an enormous
business, and when some days ago rumors
became current that the firm was in finan
cial trouble there was much surprise, and
doubts a? to their correctness were Ireely
expressed.
The business firm was established by
the late Alexander T. Stewart in 1523.
Some time after Mr Stewart's death in
IS$6, the firm name was changed to that
of E. J. Denning & Co., and so continued
until about five years ago. Upon Mr.
Denning's death at that time it was again
j changed, ex-Judge Hilton becoming senior
I partner, and the business being continued
I until the present firm name.
The business for the last quarter of a
century has been carried on in the great
establishment in the block bounded by
Broadway, Fourth avenue and Ninth and
Tenth streets.
During the height of the season Hilton,
Hughes 4 Co. had frequently employed,
including inside and outside help, over
S2OO hands. Recently the help had not
exceeded 1500. Daring the past four
| months the staff had been constantly re
! duced. the number "let out" since May
exceeding 400.
A representative of one of the commer
cial agencies was early on the scene.
"The firm," he said, "has not been con-
S sidered strong for over a year past. It has
j been considered slow in making pay
ments. Witnin a recent period it had
come to my knowledge that many firms
had declined to sell them goods. The
liabilities, I expect, will reach JTOO.OOO." 1

TENNIS AT SANTA MUNICA,
Crated* of Interested Spectator* Witnea*
Hotly Contested Game*.
SANTA MONICA, Cal., Aug. 26.âTo
day the Casino courts were crowded by
tennis devotees, who were more than re
paid by witnessing as good games as have
ever been played anywhere, and certainly
more hotly contested matches than have
ever been played in one day at the tennis
courts here beside the sea. In the morn
ing play commenced in all-comers singles,
Freeman won from Welcolm by default,
and Picher beat Way, 6â4, 2â6, 6âo. In
the third round, in the semi-finals, Free
man beat Daggett in an exceedingly warm
contest, although the score mignt fail to
show it, 2â6, 6â3, 6âo, and Picher beat
Rowan after a beautiful contest, 7 â 6, S â 6,
6â2, leaving Freeman and Picher to con
test in the finals in the morning, and the
tournament winner to contest with Arthur
Bnmiller for the championship of the
south.
Play commenced ip the afternoon in
open doubles by Welcolm and Bell defeat
ing Lester and Alexander, 7â6, 6â2. In
the preliminary of the first round Braly

Miss Barlow Massacs of England, a recent
arrival at our courts. Miss Jones was pit
ted against Miss Barlow Massacs in the
opening match of the event, easily win
ning by the ecore of 6âo, 6 â 2. In justice
to the lady defeated, who has won many
tennis honors in England, it should he
stated that she is out of practice and un
acquainted with cement courts.

THE CADET TENTS
IN EVERGREEN,
Camp O'Ryan at Glen Ellen
Getting Into Hand
some Form.
FATHER YORKE ARRIVES
Chaplain McDonald, the Fisher
man, Who Works the
Neighboring Streams.
IMMORTAL "NEVER SLIiEPERS."
Cadets Who Slept in a Boxcar, Like
Warriors Taking Their
Rest, Etc.
GLEN ELLEN, Cal., Aug. 26.â The
presence of the Rev. Peter C. Yorke in
camp has given the cadets new life and
new interest He has the happy faculty
of unbending when among them and they
play and joke with the distinguished
young priest as if be was a popular pri
vate in Company H. Many visitors from
the surrounding country dropped into
camp to-day to pay their respects to
Father Yorke and to see the boys and in
more than one case baskets of luscious
fruits and messes of trout from the creek
have been presented at headquarters. The
Rev. James McDonald, chaplain of the
camp, is an enthusiastic sportsman.
Nothing pleases him better than a trudge
over the mountains in quest of game.
Every trip results in a full bag of rabbits
and doves, which are enjoyed at the offi
cers' mess.
Captain D. J. McCarthy, Lientenant Ed
ward Crowley, Sergeant Quinnine and
Private J. O'Leary of Company E and Ser
geant Benjamin Coryl of Company B
drove to Santa Rosa yesterday. The ob
ject of the trip to the capital of Sonoma
County was to extend an invitation to the
people of Santa Rosa and around there to
visit Camp O'Ryan.
The camp has divided itself into little
clubs or parties, which overshadow the in
tegrity of the individual companies.
There are the "Pride of the Southside" in
Company A, the "Never Sleepers" in
Company B, the "Damfino" and "Five
Pirates" in Company C, "The Ministers,"
I "The Kogues," "Jolly Old Dudes,"
! "Seven Sleepers," etc.
The five pirates are causing no end of
trouble by their wild antics at most un
seasonable hours of the night, and if any
thing be stolen in camp, a guard is
promptly detailed to inspect the piratical
tent. So far nothing has been found with
the pirates that would indicate their guilt,
but when a cadet sees his saber and belt
or his shirt or tunic swinging from the top
of a tall tree next morning, there are
grave suspicions thrown in the direction
of the five pirates' tent.
A number of the cadets stole out of
camp last night, and failing to run the
guard on their return, slept in a boxcar at
the Donahue dtpot until the conductor
rudely disturbed their slumbers at 5:30
a. M. ' Stiff and cold they made for camp,
only to be put in prison. As the boys say,
"they are on the police force now."
An announcement was made this morn
ing that Father Yorke had given $5,
Father McDonald $5 and Dr. A. P. Mulli
gan $5 for the three best decorated and
neatest tents In camp. This set the ca
dets at work cleaning up, setting their
tents in "apple-pie order," as they called
it, and transforming the exteriors into
evergreen bowers.
Company H and Company C had a large
quantity of bunting which was cleverly
worked in with the green. Strips of tri
color and star-bespangled muslin were
drawn from tent to tent and lanterns hung
between, with the outside covered with
festoons and garlands. In many placej
the American flag was judiciously woven
in with really good effect. Companies B,
G and E snowed good taste in their ar
rangement of festoons and ropes of leaves,
so although they lacked decorative bunt
ing, their side of the camp appeared to
good advantage with the varied autum
nal colors of the forest and strings of
Japanese lanterns.

THE WEAVERVILLE TRIAL
Tracing Joe Gregory's Whereabouts on
the Day After the Litt/efie/d
Lynching,
WEAVEEVILL.E, Cal., Aug. 26.â A1l
the evidence given to-day in the trial of Joe
Gregory lor complicity in the lynching ol
"Jack" Littlefield in Round Valley last
September was corroborative ol that that
has gone upon record in the past week. A
half-dozen witnesses told of circumstances
that point strongly toward the defendant's
guilt.
Walter Clark, the half-breed, stated on
the stand this morning thai while at the
Red Mountain House on the evening of
September 27, 1895, he heard three shots
fired about ten minutes after sundown.
The reports came from the spot where the
witness subsequently saw the body of
"Jack" Littlefield hanging to a tree.
Peter O'Neil swore that on the 26th ol
September, himself, in company with
Charles Gregory, a brother to the defend
ant, Fred Radcliffe and Mrs. Radcliffe, left
Covelo between 9 and 10 o'clock in the
morning en route to Vinton'a cabin.
About three-quarters of a mile from Covelo
Mrs. Radcliffe and Charles Gregory rode
on ahead. The next morning Joe Greg
ory and Buck Lacock came early to Vin
ton's cabin. O'Neil spoke to Lacock be
fore 1 he reached the cabin. Lacock told
him that Vinton had been shot and wanted
Gregory to come over. Radcliffe mounted
a mule and rode over to Haydon's house
in company with Gregory and Buck La
cock. Gregory carried a rifle when they
started, but Radcliffe bore no arms.
When they returned both carried rifles,
and in addition Gregory wore a six
shooter. On the afternoon of that day
(September 27) the witness, with Radcliffe
and Charlie Gregory, went fishing down
past the lower crossing of Eei River.
About 3:30 o'clock O'Neil saw Crow, Little
field and Van Horn (Van Horn ahead, Lit
tlefield in the middle and John Crow be
hind) crossing the river in the direction of
the Red Mountain House. When asked if
he had seen any one else that day O'Neill
said that they had met a party camped on
the river (the Rose Russ and Annie Crabtree
party previously mentioned during the
trial), and that later he saw Bill Espey,
Frank Potter, Frank Hanover and a Fleet
wood boy.
The party had been iip to Haydon's
house. O'Neill stated positively that both
Fred Radciiffe and Joe Gregory returned
that night to Vinton's cabin after dark.
When cross-questioned by Oregon San
ders, attorney for the defense, whether he
had not told many persons in and about
Round Valley that Gregory and Radcliffe
had returned to the Vinton cabin before
sundown O'Neill replied that he had.
When asked why, he answered that he
was afraid ol getting shot in the back, as
many another man had in Round Valley,
for knowing too much, as was William
Williams and Sherman, recently killed at
Covelo.
"I was afraid that if I told the truth
Gregory would murder me," O'Neili said.
SAN DIEGO REJECTS THE LINE.
Refuses the Oriental Steamship Com-
party's Proposition Because San Fran
cisco Gained Thereby.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aur. 26.â President
Morse of the Chamber of Commerce,
Simon Levi, J. E. Fishburn and George H.
Ballou, constituting the committee from
the Merchants' and Manufacturers' Asso
ciation, to confer with a similar committee
of Los Angeles business men regarding
the Japanese steamship line, returned this
evening from Los Angeles. After a con
ference lasting two hours, the joint com
mittee of the two cities had adopted the
following resolution, rejecting the propo
sition of the Japanese, because of the in
sertion of a clause making the port of San
Francisco one of the terminals, the previ
ous understanding with President Asano,
at the Brewster Hotel, in this city, being
that San Diego would be made the exclu
sive terminus:
Whereas, The proposition submitted by the
Oriental Steamship Company, tnrough S.
Asano, with regard to the raising of guaranty
of freight from this section, contains a pro
vision which is ar variance with the under
standing that has prevailed in previous nego
tiationsâa provision whereby San Diego is de
prived of the advantage of being the only port
to be touched on the American coast*; and
whereas, said provision will destroy a large
element of value of the line to the commerce of
this section ; therefore, be it
Jicso'ved, As the sentiment of the joint com
mittee representing- the Chamber of Com
merce of Los Anseles and the Chamber of
Commerce ot can Diego, to whom this matter
has been referred tor consideration by these
respective todies, that said proposition of the
Oriental Steamship Company cannot be ac
cepted in its present form, and is respectfully
referred back to the company, with the Drom
ise of friendly co-operation and interest in
any line which they may establish between
Japan and Southern California.
Santa Cruz Hater Bonds.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Aug. 26.â Judge
Magaire of San Francisco and Frank J.
Sullivan, who represents the Phelan estate
here, addressed a mass-meetinz to-night
on the subject of the necessity for the tax
payers ol tnis city to push the defense of
the suit of Albert H. Waito against the
city of Santa Cruz for the payment of the
water bonds transferred by Walter
Stanton. They declared that the aliened
larceny of the $360,000 worth of bonas by
Stanton could not be held under the re
quirements of procedure to be an indict
able crime, but that the principal roint in
this issue is to show that they are not ne
gotiable bonds.
â  Ffa ? â¦!?* Sa L liTan showed that the hold
ing of these bonds valid by the court
would necessitate the payment by the city
of not merely 5360.000 for building the
water works, bat an additional $300 000 or
more for the refunding bonds, making an
actual total indebtedness of $70? 000

RIDING THROUGH NEVADA
The Transcontinental Relay Riders Making
Fast Time â Li/lie's Adventure
Near Cascade.
WHITE PLAINS, Nev., Aug. 26.â The
Examiner- Journal transcontinental bicy
cle relay arrived at White Plains, 351
miles distant from San Francisco, at 8:43
o'clock to-night, twelve minutes ahead of
schedule time. Clark station was passed
at 2:10 p. m., Wadsworth at 3:50 p. m., and
Hot Springs at 7 p. m. The couriers are
making faster time than was expected
and will probably reach Lovelocfcs by mid
night.
RENO, NÂ«v., Aus. 26.â The riders of
the Examiner relay race passed through
Truckee at 9:32 this morning. T. R.
Lillie, the rider who carried the packet
from Dutch FJat to Truckee, met with a
thrilling adventure while crossing the
large steel bridge near Cascade. The
snowsheds in that vicinity deaden. the
sound of approaching trains, and while in
the middle of the bridge Lillie became
cognizant of the fact that a freight train
was almost upon him. He made a gallant
run for the end of the bridge, and had he
not made fast time a death would have
been recorded as a starter for the big race.
He beat the train but a few seconds.
The relay at Truckee was made without
a moment's loss, the courier riding from
Truckee to Verdi beating schedule time by
ten minutes.

ties, must then withdraw from the canvass or
depend on their personal following for sup
port.
Without discussing the legal questions In
volving the power of said committees, or any
portion thereof, to tear a party candidate
from his ticket, and disfranchise his party at
the behest of strangers to the convention that
nominated him, it may as well be understood
(hal Charles D. Lane is the copartner of Al
vinza Hay ward and occupies offices with him
ia the Hobart building, in which are the San
Francisco offices of more than one operating
department of the Southern Pacific Company
oi Kentucky; that Alvinza Hayward is now
in contempt of court for refusing to disclose
the assessable property of the Market-street
Railroad Company, another corporation kin
dred of the Southern Pacific Company; that
Charles D. Lave represents no silver conÂ»
Etituency in this State and attended the Na
tional Silver Convention at St. Louis as an ap
pointee of one G. W. Baker, wno is shown by
the court records of Alameda and other coun
ties to be an attorney in the employ of the
Southern Pac ific Company.
Are Baker, Lane & Co., as the retained at
torneys and associates of the Southern Pacific
Company, to control the Congressmen that are
to represent California in tae National Legis
lature? If so -was there ever a more shame
less betrayal of the people of this State?
I have the honor of being secretary of the
first silver organization that came into exist
ence in California, but it could not be con
trolled by hirelings of the Sou them Pacific,
and they, with the aid of a traitor in our
ranks, set up a rival organization and headed
it with G. W. Baker. In June last they ad
mitted that they had no organization In the
State, but, thinking they could fool tne
people, they made a call for Senatorial dis
trict conventions to elect delegates m to the Na
tional Silver Convention held last month in
St. Louis. Not half a dozen delegates so
elected under the call attended the conven
tion. Those elected refused to agree to the
Baker programme, and their places in the
delegation of forty-fire members were filled
by appointments made by G. W. Baker.
Since the return from St. Louis, the Lane-
Baker- Southern Pacific Company combination
have appointed their State executive com
mittee, and a member thereof is Thomas V.
Cator, the Populist candidate for United
States Senator. In San Luis Obispo, on the
14th inst., and in my presence, Mr. Cator to a
number of Populists in eSect stated that. he
had made a deal with the Democracy by which
the Populists were to have the Assemblymen
and the Democrats the Senators in November
next to be elected to the California Legislature.
At the same time and place he also in sub
stance asserted that by reason of his personal
exertions the Lane-'Buker-Southern Pacific
Company combination had beep induced not
to contribute funds to the Democratic State
Central Committee, bat to make the fight in
their own behalf as a silver organization.
This was "the result of a week's good work,"
he ejaculated with gusto.
As she Senators to be elected hold office for
four years and in 1899 will vote for a successor
to Stephen M. White, and as there are eighty
Assemblymen and twenty State Senators to be
chosen next November, it is obvious who
would be the real beneficiaries of the deal, to
the detriment of several loyal Democrats and
Populists who deserve the honor of represent
ing California in the United States Senate.
Yet this is not all, for it appears in the col
umns of a San Francisco daily newspaper,
isaaed March 21, 1596. that G. W. Baser said
that "the Bimetallic League (Baker being its
chairman) recognized the fact that Populists
were silver meu, and in order to head oS Debs
and Taubeneck, who is chairman of the Popu
list National Committee, the Bimetallic
League sent three men from California to (he
meeting of the Populist National Committee
with the view of inducing it to postpone the
meeting of the Populist National Convention
until after the Republican and Democratic
conventions had trani.ed their platforms and
nominated their candidates."
.In view of the fact that E. M. Wardall was
then, and is now, chairman of the People's
party State Central Committee, and is not a
member of the PopuliÂ«t National Committee,
it seems in order for him to explain the reason
of his attendance and action at the session of
the National Committee which called the last
Peop party National Convention to meet at
& time that necessarily resulted in the present
demoralized condition of his party. If the
Baker-Lane-Cator-Sonthern Pacific Company
combination would speak truthfully they might
account for Mr. Wardaii's action in the prem
ises, and explain his willingness to now sur
render the nominees of his party to their con
trol.
In conclusion, I will say that the true silver
men oi this State uo not seek to in terrene
themselves into such an unholy alliance. We
trust to the wise judgment of the honest men
in the rank? of those' who support William J.
Bryan for President, and >ye will support any
silver candidate who remains free and unfet
tered wits corporation chains. Respectfully,
Alva Udell, Secretary Bimetallic Party.
POPCLIbTS AT BEMCIA.
W. A. Tann of Coins* Is dominated for
Congress.
BENICIA, Cal . Aug. 26.â The Popu
list Convention of the Third Congressional
Di-trict held here to-day, was presided
over by W. A. Vann of Colusa.
The secretary called the roll and 30 out
of 44 delegates were found to be present.
A minority report waa presented asking
the convention : to reinstate Marion Can
non in the ranks of the Populists, but on
motion it was laid on the table.
A platform was adopted pledging the
convention to the support of Bryan and j
Watson and indorsing - the action of the
State Executive Committee regarding the
election of seven Congressmen pledged to
free coinage *of ' silver. It was f resolved
that the convention nominate a candidate ]
for Congressman Â» subject i to \ the Â« indorse- !

TACOMA, Wash-, An*. 36.â The Re

Hyde of* Spokane and W. Y. Doolittie of
Tacoma. Then, in order to prevent the
possible nomination of P. C. Sullivan of
Tacoma, Republican National Committee
man for this State, for Governor, the con-
I vention adjourned.
Thetiehton Sullivan is also a fight on
Governor John H. McGraw, who is slated
for the United States Senate, to succeed
Senator Squire, who has joined the free
silver Repuolican3. ilcGraw thus far has
been sat upon by his political enemies,
'<â  although a sentence was inserted in the
1 platform denouncing personal abuse of
the chief executive of the State and in
dorsing his acts. His plan, coupled with .
that of the Republican National Commit
teeman, P. C. Snilivan, contemplates
nominating Sullivan for Governor, thus
shutting cut the present Secretary of
State for a renomination. The Secretary
is strong all over the State and is upset
ting and smashing the slate.
The convention adopted a platform in
â  dorsing the St. Louis platform in all its
details on the currency question, quoting
the St. Lonis plank, and adds the words:
\Ve heartily approve of the declaration of
the Republican National Convention in which
it pledges the Republican party to promote an
: international agreement, ana we hereby mi
i struct oar Senators and Representatives in
t Congress to earnestly co-operate with the ad
ministration to that end. We believe that
patriotic citizens of the Nation will never in
trust its monetary legislation to any parry
; under the leadership of such men as Bryan,
' Tillman and Altgeid.
The platform declares for protection,
: pensions to soldiers, equitable freight
rates, election of United States Senators
by direct vote, immediate survey of Gov
ernment lands, land registration system,
: stringent immigration laws, and denounces
1 the Chicago platform, especially the at
tack on the Supreme Court. The woman
suffrage plank was voted down, and a
resolution censurine State officials tor ac
cepting railroad passes was ignored.
The fight over the nomination of Gov
! ernor is keeping, excitement at a high
; pitch to-night. A full delegation is pres
ent from every county.
SHORTRIDGE AT NEVADA CITY.
{ Large Republican Gathering Addressed
6y the San Franciscan.
NEVADA, Cal., Aug. 26â The Repub
i lican campaign was opened here to-night
with one of the largest and mos: enthusi
astic meetings ever held in Nevada
County. The entire population turned
I out to hear Samuel M. Shortridge. A
. special train bore hundreds of Republi
' cans from Grass Valley. The theater in
. which the meeting was held was crowded
to the doors and many could not gain ad
mittance.
Mr. Shortridge paid special attention to
the financial question. He pointed out
' the mistakes, fallacies and failures of the
; Democratic party, declaring it was
â  ashamed of its record and sought to mis
lead the American people by a false issue.
He showed that financial depression and
"hard" times were not the result of the
want of money, but of lack of confidence.
He declared that toe Republican party, as
the true bimetallic party, should be
trusted by the American people to suc
\ cessfully deal with the financial questions.
â  In eloquent words the speaker called upon
! Republicans to organize and work for the
I whole ticket. In conclusion he said:
"The dart night of Democracy is pass
ing away never to return. The welcome
tight of Republican morning is breaking.
Fear not; t.e Democratic nigh: of dis
aster, danger and dismay will soon be
past, and we sha.l be once again in the
hieh. noon of Republican power, progress
and prosperity."
The meeting was under the auspices of
the McKinley Club, and F. J. Dennis,
president of that organization, was its
chairman.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aue. 26.â Calmly
and quietly tbe slated county ticket of the
Democratic- Populists fusion passed down
the line to-day and drifted placidly through
the twin conventions, with one solitary
approach to a jar, and that was in the
nomination of candidates for the Superior
judaeship in the Democratic side of tbe
bouse. The candidates were three and
the positions in the Democratic gift were
two, and for the past week all the candi
dates have been drilling and drilling hard.
"I 1 aye been in a number of hard politi
cal battles in my life," said Judge Mat F.
Johnson to-night, as he wiped the per
spiration from his brow, "bat this was by
long odds the hottest I ever encountered."

SANTA BARBARA POLITICS.
The Daily Independent Drops Into the
Free Silver Hanks. -
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Aug. 26.â
Silver is having its innings at Santa Bar
ban, which is generally regarded as a
solid gold town when it comes to voting.
Within a few days the Daily Independent
has been leased to Charles L. Donahue and
Clio . Lloyd and has changed its politics
irom a goid Democratic sheet to free silver.
To-night Stephen M. White spoke at the
opera-house to a large audience.
Santa Barbara journalism is now in a
â¢ very peculiar way. Of her three papers
" two are free silver Democratic sheets and
the other is understood to be owned and
conducted by a life-long Democrat, : al
though nominally a Republican ; sheet.
Yet Santa Barbara is a strong Republican
town and always polls a heavy majority
for that party.

DEL MONTE PAPER CHASE
Buriingame Riders Indulge in
Game of Hare and
Hounds.
Mr. Lawson Wins the Prize by Beat"
ing the Pursuers Over the
Course.
DEL MONTE. Cal., An*. 26.â John
Lawson won the paper chase to-day. That
is he was the first of the "hounds" to fin
! ish. "I nevah saw such a beastly ride,"
ejaculated the winner as his tired pony
took the last jump thirty-five minutes
after the "hare;" had completed the
course. It was all wonderfully flat. Two
"bares," one of whom laid out the course
with ten minutes start of six "hounds,"
beat the nearest of their competitors home
more than half an hour. Others of the
"canines" are probably running yet.
It is complained by members of tbe pur
suing party that in addition to tbe ten
I minutes start the "hares" had the ad
| vantage of leaving an almost undistinguish
! able trail. The paper used Was white and
at certain portions of the route could not
be perceived.
Captain Wainwright and Cecil Tobin,
who impersonated the hares, left the
entrance of the Hotel Del Monte at 3:38
p. x. With eyes starting and ears wob
bling the bunnies started off in a fright,
leaving behind a plain "scent." At 3:48
Daniel O'Connell, John Lawson, Henry
Scott, Frank Carroll, Francis Francis and
a juvenUe member of the Tobin family,
who constituted the "pack," were in full
bay on the trail. A number of sanguinary
spectators, anxious to be in at tbe death,
followed in a rags, dog carts, victorias and
otaer vehicles of more plebeian build. I
W. 8. Hobart and party occupied his drag;
Charles A. Baldwin and party were en
sconced in a victoria; the Misses Tobin
were in two dog carts, attended by Richard
M. Tobin ana Caesare Poma; Mrs. Caro
lan and party followed in a handsome
i equipage. Other members of local soci- j
j ety were sandwiched in between tbe turn
outs oi the citizens of Monterey and
vicinity.
It was no trick at all to get to the finish ]
in front of the grand stand of the race- !
track before the hares arrived. Everybody j
I was comfortably settled when the pursued !
hove in sight. When they urged their ]
horses over the hurdle tbey received a !
siight round of applause. Then when Mr. I
Lawson, Mr. O'Connell and Mr. Scott jrot !
in half an hour later there was a little â 
more applause, and the muchly heralded i
I paper chase was over.
The hares had proven themselves very
fleet. Mr. Lawson had beaten his con
ferees. Mr. O'Connell had finished a close '
second and Mr. Scott a creditable third. I
There waa no fourth. One of the other ;
starters was found sipping tea with some '<
I female friends when the cavalcade re- i
turoed to the hotel. Frank Carroll got ]
lost. He probably did not emulate the
example of Mr. Archibald at San Mateo
some time ago and trail a Chinese funeral, â¢
but. at any rate, he got lost.
He, however, subsequently found him- !
self. Mr. O'Connell lost both his stirrups, !
or he wonid have won. He was a full ;
cigarette smoke ahead of all competitors â¢
when the untoward accident happened.
To-morrow's programme includes fire
j races. The first is a quarter-mile dash for i
qualified polo ronies, gentlemen riders, \
for which there are five entries. Tbe sec- i
ond is a six-furlong affair for ail ages, with i
j nine entries. The third is another event !
I for gentlemen jockeys, five furlongs for !
1 ponies, with *ix entries. There are ten '
: entries for the fourth race, for ail ages at I
I a mile, and nine for the fifth, a two-mile '
I steeplechase.
The cup prite; for polo and race win- â ,

in the lobby of the hotel and are much i

The Mill Valley and Mount Tamalpais
Scenic Railroad Company cave an excur
sion over its unique road to-day to mem
bers of the press. Comparatively few
prominent lights of the quill were pres
ent, but a goodly number of leading men
of other callings attended, and they were
deeply interested in what they saw.
The train for the mountain trip starts
from the terminu3 of the Mill Valley
Raiiroad, and the shift of cars suggests
the change of clothing made by tourists
at the inns well up the slopes of the Alps.
Everything pertaining to the new road is
suggestive of strength. It is a Sharkey
track, and a Snarkey engine and train.
The engine is massive and powerful, but
yielding and elastic. It is pivoted, so to
speak, jointed in unusual places, and
automatic ia every artery and vein. It is
solemn and deliberative, buiit for busi
ness, and gives an "at home" impression.
And this im tression attaches to every
thing about tbe road.
The train goes straight toward the sky,
or at least rises 2300 feet in a little over
two miles as the crow flies, and yet the
most timid passenger feels perfectly se
cure. The road is eight and a quarter
; miles long, ascending by an average of
less than 5 per cent to the mile, and never
exceeding 7. The bed is almost all on
solid rock, cut in the spurs of the moun
tain, and as firm as its giant ribs. Very
few fills occur, very few trestles, and these
very short. But it :s a maze of loops and
doubles, which call into requisition all
the late advances in railroad science. Its
sharpest loops have a radius of only 72
feet, and in rounJmg tnem the train sug
gests the eld cotiiion bgure of right and
left, while the engine and rear car are
dancing dos y do?.
The ascent it made in ninety minutes
and the descent in forty-hve. The first
business trip open to the public will be
made to-morrow, leaving tne City at II :45
o'clock and returning tor dinner at home.
A delightfu* luncn was served by the
I company under the trees at Biythedaie,
|in the inspiration of which President
Cushing and Engineer Dodee were warmly
[ commended for iheir valiant enterprise
and sk llful work by General Warfield, ex
! Mayor Pond, Thomas Magee, Hugh Craig
and James I. Taylor. Mr. Magee .Â»aid the
Tamalpais Land Company had invested
$30,000 in the great work and he would
himself be willing to take $20,000 if there
was no return for it but the encourage
ment of an enterprise so beneficial to the
locality ana tbe State.
A large hotel is in construction at the
summit ard many fine improvements will
be completed before the opening of the
next festive season.
NATIONAL CITY'S FAILURE
Liabilities of a De'unct Bank
Are in Excess of the
Assets.
State Commissioners Find That an
Immediate Assessment Most
Be Made.
SA>" DIEGO, Cal, Aug. 26.â The State
Bank Examiners have declared the Bank
of National City insolvent, and have or
dered an assessment of 10 per cent on the
capital stock, which ia $300,000, with |30,
--000 paid np. The order is the result of the
examination of the Dank by Commissioner
McGee, who found a state of arfairs not
[ tallying with the report of the directors
I when tbe bank closed on August 12. In-
I stead of assets in excess of the liabilities,
the Commissioners find that the bank is
not in a position to i>ay its depositors, and
that an assessment of $30,000 is immedi
ately necessary.
Some days ago a committee of deposit
ors wae appointed to confer with the di
rectors for tbe purpose of securing a repre
sentation of depositors on the board and a
controlling number if possible. This com
mittee reported to a meetinz of depositors
to-day that the directors seemed willing
to allow a representation of depositors on
tne directorate, but it was doubtful if they
would allow tbe control of the bank to
pass out of their hands. The other points
of conference were aot agreed upon, and
the depositors to-day seemed more nerv
ous than at any time previous.
"We scarcely doubt that we will receive
onr money," said one of the creditors of i
i the bank 'to-day, "but it looks as if we
would have to go through a long siege to \
get it There are some stockholders who
are not solvent, and the burden will fall
upon the others, and mainly upon two,
Warren C. Kimball of National City and
George W. Haie of Malone, N. Y. 'Kim
ball is well-to-do and Hale is very j

"The condition of the bank is not as :
good as we were led to -uppose by the di- ;
recurs' statement. \Ye are keeping a
lookout now to discover solvent stock
holders and prevent them from disposing {
of their property. Still I believe we will \
get our money, as toe Bank Commission
ers are authorized to levy assessments
against the entire $300,000 of authorized !
capital stock, while tae sum due depos
itors is only $51,000."

IN A GALE OFF AVALON,
Saucy Little Defender Jr. and a
Party of Excursionists Have
a Close CalL
Loses Her Mast and Drifts Help
lessly About Until Tak n in Tow
by a Steamer.
AVALON, Catalisa Island, Aug. 26.â
Defender Jr., the yacht modeled after the
famous winner of the international cup
races, had a thrilling experience yesterday
which came near ending her earthly career
entirely as well as that of those on board.
Defender Jr. has been at Avalon for the
past month, and early in the week was
taken to San Pedro by her . owner and
builder, Captain C. H. Wedgewood, who
returned to the island wits her last Satur
day. Yesterday morning she .trimmed
her sails to the breeze and sailed out of
Avaion Bay bound for .the mainland.
Captain Wedge wood had on board a party
of friends, including two ladies. All went
well until within six or seven miles of San
Pedro harbor, when a terrific gale struck
the craft. The stanch little racer battled
gallantly for a time, but the odds were
against her and a violent gale snapped
her mast like a pipestem, dismantling her
canvas like a cyclone. The boat drifted
helplessly about until the steamer Her
mosa on her daily trip to the island
sighted her. though she was lying some
two-miles off the track of the steamer.
The Hermosa went to her assistance and
towed her back to Ava'on.
The : speed of > the big steamer was too
much tor th? racing qualities of the I little
craft, however, and her passengers were
subjected to a good ducking. .At times
the spray few so that the little model
could not be distinguished by passengers
on the decks of the Hermosa through the
cloud of foam which closed about her
wake. The passengers on the racer were
deluged in salt water, and when Avalon
was reached she was half full of water, and
as her crew came ashore in row boats they
looked as if they bad swam across.
One of the ladies fainted through fright
before the Hermosa came to the rescue,
and altogether the affair has created not a
little excitement in yachting circles. As
a matter of fact. Defender Jr. has not
proven herself to be the racer she was ex
pected to be, ; and * has not ' yet .won â¢' her

Secretary of State Brown Gives
His Understanding of the
State Law.
NAMES MAY KOT BE GROUPED.
Tne Organization That Surrenders Its
Name Relinquishes Political
Rights.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 26.â "1 find
that I have been misquoted by the press,"
said Secretary of State Lewis H. Brown to
a Call representative 10-day. "I have
never said to any one that I would refuse
to put any nominations on tae electoral
ticket, ncr do I propose to take any party
or political advantage, but I shall do what
I de^m right under the law. Where doubt
exists, I shall defer to the opinion of the
Attorney-General. It will be impossible
for me to anticipate in what lorm election
certiheates will be presented for uiing,
and until I receive them I cannot say
what action I will take, but I shall follow
the law to the letter.
"In studying the law governing elections,
I find that several questions will arise
which are of paramount interest to the
voters of the State of ail political par
ties, as the Populists and Democrats have
decided on fusion.
"The first of these questions is: Sup
pose that the Democrats nle certificates
for five electors as nominated by their
convention, and the Populists hie cer
tificates lor four electors as nominated by
them. Now, the law of 1593 makes an ex
ception in the case of Presidential electors
over the case of individual candidates, by
proviaing that electors shall be grouped
under the heaa of the party they represent,
and sucn heading shall be in large letters.
We know of but four parties â Republican,
Democratic, Populists and Pronibitionists
â and a pariy 10 be a party under tbe iaw
must poll at "the preceding election 3 per
cent of the vote of the State. It
seems to me to be impossible to
group the Democrats and Populists
under one heading and together
because each of their present conventions
must certify to its own nominees, and
there is no provision in the existing law
which empowers the Secretary of State
to group. As they as distinct parties ful
filled the requirements of the law by cast
ins 3 per cent of the State vote each, they
should not \t this time form a new party
under a fusion heading, *but must eacu
group by itself witn its individual party
head, as there is no law that I am aware
of that admits of consolidation.
"The main question regarding fusion is
as to whether the same names can be put
upon tlie ballot twice, once under tue
name of the Democratic party and once
under the name of the Populist party.
.Should this be declared possible, then
fusion might be possible, but otherwise I
cannot see how fusion as to electors is
possible. In my judgment one or the
other of tne parties desiring to fuse must
surrender its party organization and have
all nine electors called ail Democrats or
all Popuiists. The party doing this would
be wiped out of existence as. no votes be
ing cait icr it under tne party name, it
could not present the necessary 3 per cent
vote of the 6tate required by law at the
following election. In other words, if de
sirous in tht future of making State nom
inations, it conld not do so, having for
feited party rights."

STOCKTON BOAT TRAGEDY
Dennis Herliehey of This City
Meets His Death During
a Spree.
Quarreled With Companions and to
lodge a Blow Backed Into
the Water.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 2aâ Aboct 8
o'clock last night the passengers on the
steamer T. C. Walker, on her way to this
city from San Francisco, were startled by
the cry, "Man overboard!" The boat was
stopped and an effort made to find the
man, who was said to have gone over the
railing, but the search proved ineffectual.
The man who was drowned was named
Dennis Herliehey. He lived on Twenty
sixth street, San Francisco.
This morning when the boat neared the
Stockton wharf Captain C. Schuler, who
had investigated the matter, decided that
three men were responsible for the drown
ing, so he whistled for officers. A police
man and deputy sheriff responded and
arrested John Voli, Harry Samm and F.
W. Samm, the last two being brothers.
The taller of the two was indirectly re
sponsible for Herliehey's death.
AU the men had been drinking together
and were under the influence of liquor,
Herliehey being the most intoxicated. He
complained because he had not been in
vited to arink, and the taller of the Samm
bovg took offense at his manner, saying.
"I'll smash yon; and to show that I will, I
do smash you," and with that he struck
him a heavy blow. He then started to
follow Herliehey up to administer further
castigaiion, and in his drunken efforts to
escape the latter backed against the rail
and fell overboard.
The District Attorney examined wit
nesses to the affair this morning, bat no
charge has been placed against the pris
oners yet.

THURSDAY ....AUGUST 27, 1896
THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION
and PROSPERITY.
rOR FBKSIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
Â»OR TICJF-PRESIDENT-
GARRET A. HOB&RT, of New Jersey
BtKCTION NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
Read McKinley's letter.
The champion of prosperity speaks well.
Democracy may squirm, but the tariff is
an issue.
Now let Republicans unite and make
the victory sure
California will answer the great letter
with a rousing majority.
The banner of protection is upraised and
the people will rally to it.
We need international bimetallism and
the Republican party will give it.
The letter of acceptance is long, but
none too long for earnest voters to read.
International bimetallism is reason,
silver monometallism is a craze.
The campaign is far advanced and no
one as yet has told Tom Watson where he
stands.
The farmers can be counted on this year
to vote for McKialey and the home
market.
The people have confidence in McKinley,
and in that confidence lies the assurance
of prosperity.
Men who attempt to stir up strife in
Republican ranks may call themselves
Republicans, but no one else does. .
There is a promise of better times in
McKinley's letter to every farm, forge,
fireside and factory in tbe country.
The platform and the letter of accept
ance are about the only campaign docu
ments the Republican party needs.
Protection and prosperity are synony
mous terms in this country, and to have
the one we must support the other.
Imposing a charge on the transportation
of bicycles is such a poor business that
even a monopoly cannot make it pay.
If tho fellows who told us four years ago
"the tariff is a tax" could be found now
they would he beard shouting "the deficit
is a bonus."'
Intelligent Americans will take notice
that McKinley speaks always of the har
mony of labor and capital, while Bryan
speaks only of conflict between them.
The Dcs MoineÃ Capital takes the cake
with this : "Mr. Bryan, you shall not press
another patch on the pants of American
labor; you shall not crucify the weary
Willie at the crossroads."
With thousands of men out of employ
ment and winter coming on, every sane
man can see that the chief issue before the
country is to reopen the shops and pro
vide work for the workers.
The Examiner says McKin ley's recent
speech to the potters was the same he
delivered in 18SG, and then neglects to add
that Bryan is not telling tbe country any
thing he said in that year. .
The State Fair managers, who are ar
ranging for a series of discussions of live
topics, would make a ten stroke if they
could get Sewall and Watson to come to
Sacramento and debate their little issue.
The Democrats seem to have agreed to
let the elections in the East go by default
this year, and this gives the Republicans
of the West the glory of meeting the
whole force of the enemy and defeating it.
Those so-called Republicans who are
trying to divide the party, drag down the
leaders and confuse the public are really
trying to give the victory to Democ
racy but haven't the courage to make an
open fight.
If you use articles made in some other
country you benefit the labor of that coun
try; if yon use home-made goods you
benefit home labor; if you vote for free
trade in foreign articles yon vote against
American workingmen, and if yon vote
the Democratic ticket you vote for lree
trade.
In giving an account of a controversy
between C. F. McGlashan and A. Cami
netti, in which McGlashan is reported to
nave said, "You can't call my friend a
liar," tho Examiner of yesterday says:
"Caminetti answered. ryv-gUcf&A.
c Jahvfuf." "What kind of campaign talk
is that?
In his speech at Albany Bryan said: "I
expect in this campaign the support of
many Democrats who are not willing to
indorse all tbe platform declares for," and
it would seem from this that Bryan in
tends to pose as something better than
his platform and is playing the Cleveland
dodge on the people.
SOUND, CLEAR AND SATISFYING.
Major McKinley gives voice to tbe Re
publican platform in his letter of accept
ance with force and clearness, leaving
nothing to be guessed at or twisted to
mean something else. The country now
knows for sure what to exDect if he is
elected. Like a manly man, like a sincere
patriot and like a true and tried friend
of the people Major McKinley declares that
"The first duty of the Republican party,
if restored to power in the country, will be
the enactment of a tariff law which will
raise all the money necessary to conduct
the Government, economically and hon
estly administered, and so adjusted as to
give preference to home manufactures and
adequate protection to home laborand the
home market."
Thus the country is assured that if Re
publican principles have the indorsement
of the people in November the whole
power and influence of the Government
wiil be brought t j bear to immediately se
cure such legislation as shall be most con
ducive to the well-being of every business
interest, and which shall give the wage
earner the greatest possible opportunity
for constant employment at satisfying
pay. No other assurance is needed. As
sure as the Republican party triumphs
the industries of the country will open
wide their doors and invite labor to enter
and accept permanent work at highly re
munerative wages.
On the money question Major McKinley
will be indorsed by men of ail parties who
want to see every form of our money kept
at par under any and all circumstances.
He says: "Tne Republican party has not
been and is not now opposed to the use
of silver money, as its record abund
antly shows. It has done all that could
be done for its increased nse, with
safety and honor, by the United States
acting apart from other Governments.
Ibis has been the unbroken policy of the
Republican party Bince 1875. It has in
augurated no new policy. It will keep in
circulation and as good as sold all of the
silver and paper money which are now in
cluded in the currency of the country. It
will maintain their parity. It will pre
serve their equality in the future as it has
always done in the past"
AN IMPORTANT MATTER.
The tariff and the money question are
the leading issues in this campaign, and
they cannot be discussed too much; but
meanwhile the people should not lose
sight of the attack upon the Federal Su
preme Court by the Bryan platform. It is
said that Altgeld is responsible for that
particular plank, but no matter who in
sDired or who wrote it, the fact remains
that the purpose is, if Bryan is elected, to
revamp tbe Supreme Court so that de
cisions may be had that wiil not interfere
with the operation of the principles of
Altgeldism in social ana business life.
The question of the court interpreting
lawfrom the standpoint of the declarations
of the constitution is not to be considered,
says the Chicago platform. ThÂ« Bryanites
want to accomplish certaiit things, but
which cannotfbe accomplished without
the sanction of the Supreme Court. As
the court is now constituted there is no
hope of their being sustained in their
revolutionary schemes, and so the plan is
to increase the nnmber of Justices enough
to give the Ahgelds a clear majority. It
will be seen that, with a Supreme Court in
full sympathy with the aims of the Bryan-
Altgeld combine, decisions to order could
be relied upon.
Altgeld's chief reason for wanting such
a court is to protect him, when occasion
requires, from the authority of the General
Government. There have been times in
the past when the Federal courts were
very much in hia way, and he is quite de
sirous that they should be reorganized
with some reference to his wishes in the
matter of handing down decisions. Mr.
Bryan is viciously anxious to "tap" those
who have incomes from investments and
business enterprises under the guise of an
"income tax," and he wants a Supreme
Court that will reverse tne decision of the
present court and declare that it is alto
gether constitutional for the Government
to rob its citizens that way.
But the danger of Bryanism lies, not
wholly in its purpose to revamp the
Supreme Court for political purposes. The
introduction of the spoils system would be
equally as dangerous to the risrbts of the
people, but with the spoils of office as the
reward lor disreputable campaign work,
and with a Supreme Court in sympathy
with all forms of Bryanism, which means
the very reverse of what Republicanism
stands for, the sovereignty of the people
would be turned into the serfdom of the
people. Tho people must protect the
Supreme Court of the Nation from
Altgeldism at all hazard.
REPUBLICANISM GROWING.
If the race for the Presidency were ex
tended to January the struggle for su
premacy would finally be between the
nominee of the middle-of-the-road-Demo
crats and Major McKinley. Bryan de
serters are growing in numbers very fast,
and the Populists are making lite a burden
to those who still stick to the young man's
fortunes. It so happens that the really
astute Democratic campaign managers are
against the Chicago nominee, ana there is
a suspicion that Gorman, Hill and Hoke
SjÃiith are playing Bryan to'secure certain
local advantages, and that when the war
is over he will find that they were in his
camp for the opportunity it gave them to
have access to his campaign secrets.
But, anyway, it is very clear that the
people are talcing less interest in tbe sil
ver and more in the tariff question. The
recent talks of Major McKinley to indus
trial operatives and farmers are changing
public sentiment very fast. Major Mc-
Kinley has made it very clear that it is
better to open the shops, mills and fac
tories to labor than the mints to silver,
and the sober second thought, of tbe peo
ple is taking to that idea in a way that
means the silver question is by no means
the paramount issue as they now under
stand the situation.
Mr. Bryan's vehement denunciation of
all who differ from him on economic ques
tions, and his constant appeals to wage
earners and farmers to declare war upon
capital, are setting the people to wonder
ing if he would not be a very unsafe Presi
dent. The suspicion is growing, too, that
Altgeld and Tillman are the power be
hind Bryan, and that if he were elected
he wouid be dominated by them in ail
things. But whether it is that influence
or his own boundless egotism, it is certain
that he grows more sectional and his
abuse of all who have accumulated
wealth grows more bitter every day:
It is claimed by some of Bryan's friends
that he is really a very conservative man,
and that he is trying to array class against
class to catch votes, but a man who would
resort to such a trick and so disturb busi
ness as to inflict a loss of hundreds of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 27, 1896.
millions of dollars and create feelings of
hatred between neighbors is not the peo
ple's ideal Presidential candidate. It is very
clear, too, that Chairman Jones of Bryan's
Mational Committee has no influence with
the young man. That is because the
Altgeld-TilJman combine does not pro
pose to let the young man slip so far
away as to endanger its hold upon him
should he be elected.
Altgeld and Tillman are responsible, no
doubt, for Bryan's treatment of Watson,
and the public is beginning to see or to
believe that those worthies are working a
deep scheme which does not mean good to
the country. These things, together with
Major McKmley's talks with the "com
mon people," as Bryan puts it, are chang
ing public opinion very fast in the matter
of the importance of securing protection
for our industries and work for labor first,
and silver coinage afterward; besides,
Bryan talks more about making war upon
capital than he does about the good of the
people, and the people have not been suf
ficiently educated to his theories to accept
them. At the very outset Bryan made the
mistake of trying to array class against
class, and it was a positive blunder to say
he "was going to the enemy's country"
when he started for New York. The peo
ple had enough of sectional hatred years
ago. They want peace and prosperity
now.
BRYAN MAKES THREATS.
It is doubtful if any irresponsible agi
tator of the time has uttered a more vehe
ment or vicious sentiment than did Wil
liam Jennings Bryan in his Albany (N. V.)
speech.
It would seem that he tried to put all
the fury of class hatred in the declara
tion: "We ask no quarter, we give no
quarter. We shall prosecute our warfare
until there is not an American citizen that
dares to advocate a gold-standard policy.
You ask why? We reply that the gold
standard is a conspiracy against the
human race, and that we would no more
join it than we would join an army march
ing to despoil our homes and destroy our
families."
Mr. Bryan says if you ask him why no
one will dare express the belief that the
gold standard is the better monetary sys
tem, "uÂ»e" will tell you that "the gold
standard is a conspiracy against the
human race," and "u'e" will not permit
you to advocate it because you are "an
army marching to despoil our homes and
destroy our families." The man, there
fore, who believes in the gold standard is
a despoiler of homes and a destroyer of
families. Jefferson, Jackson, Benton, Til
den, Seymour and Hendricks were, ac
cording to Bryan, despoilers of homes and
the destroyexs'of families, for they all were
gold-standard Democrats. â¢
But Mr. Bryans purpose is to in
augurate a class war â that is to say,
to set labor against capital. What tbe
thinking people will conclude to do con
cerning Bryan's effort to kindle flames of
hatred in the minds and hearts of those
who go to hear him speak remains to be
seen, but Bryan himself must know that
the intelligence and patriotism of the
country do not relish that sort of thing.
However, the more Bryan tries to set
brother against brother and neighborhood
against neighborhood the faster will the
eyes of his misguided followers be opened
to see -how dangerous to the peace and
prosperity of the country the man's pur
pose is.

ou.'ht to go out of politics itself, has, in
stead of doing so, taken steps to force into
politics other organizations that would
have gladly remained non-partisan had
they been left alone. One of these organi
zations is the California Division of the
League of American Wheelmen. It has
been comDelled to taice the field as a poli
tical force in order to obtain legislative
protection from the arbitrary action of the
company in imposing a charge upon the
transportation of bicycles.
It is difficult to understand why the
managers of the company should have
imposed such a charge when they must be
fully aware of the invariable result of
making such charges in the East. Pos
sibly it is the consciousness of the posses
sion of a virtual monopoly of railroads in
this State That has led the officials of the
corapany to believe they could succeed in
doing in California what could not be done
elsewhere. They have imposed the charge
and tne only recourse left to wheelmen is
to apoly to the Legislature this winter for
the passage of a law similar to that which
prevails in New York and Ohio, requiring
railroads to class bicycles as baggage and
carry them without extra charge.
The justice of tne claim of the wheel
men is beyond question. Passenger
charges are fixed at a rate which defrays
the cost of carrying a certain amount of
baggage as well as the passenger. Every
traveler on the road therefore is eutitled
to have that amount of baggage, though
as a matter of fact in local traffic very lit
tle baggage is carried. The railroad com
pany is thus paid for far more work than
it performs, and it will lose no money by
treating bicycles as baggage and carrying
them without further charge to any pas
senger who may choose to take his bicycle
with him on his outing trip.
The imposition of the charge is the more
unfair inasmuch as the use of bicycles
has largely increased railroad travel.
Thousands of cyclers take a short ride on
tbe train to some locality in the country
before taking to their wheels, and num
bers of others who leave town on their
bikes ride back on the trains. The very
fact that so many bicycles are handed in
at the baggage-cars is a proof of the num
ber of cyclers who patronize the trains.
They would not leave town at ail were it
not for the cycling pleasure trips thai en
tice them to the country. The railroads of
California as well as those of the East
have gained much from bicycles in this
way, and it is to be regretted that any
railroad company should be so short
sighted as to impose an extra charge for
carrying wheels, and particularly so when
ail past experience proves that the only
result of such charges is to force the league
into politics in order to protect their in
terests by legislative enactment.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.
All the great musical papers in Europe are
celebrating the Bayreuth fetes with extra num
bers, containing portraits, illustrations, etc.
"Siegfried Wagner," writes his master Humper
dinck, "has become a conductor beyond all
expectations; he made the best impression oi
them all, and Richter, Mottl and Xevy con
sider him as exceptionally gifted and more
fitted than any one else to maintain the pater
nal glory." It is reported that- the Emperor
William will assist at the last series. In spite
of the great success of these representations
it is said that there will be a deficit oi
100,000 marks. The technical requisites
absolved alone 40,000 marks. The sale
of single seats represents 24,000 marks,
and the -whole receipts amounted to
480,000 marks. The performances did
not pass off entirely without acci
dents; at the performance of the "Dusk of the
Gods" the machinist in charge of the thunder

and hands, and the tenor, Gruning, in the role
of Siegfried, wounded the vs achinist hidden
inside the body of the dragon Fafner. They
are already speaking of next year's perform
ances. The immense cost caused by the re
newing of all the decorative and technical
material once incurred, a repetition of the
"Nibeiungen" alone could succeed in making
up for the deficiency of this year. The admin
istration is thinking of repeating the "Tetra
logie" in 1897, and adding a series of repre
sentations of "Parsifal."
Delia Rofeers Is the only American singer,
Indeed, the only person not French in a troupe
of sixty, which the youug Prince of Ghica of
Roumania has selected in France to play the
coming season in the new theater at Jassy. A
competent corps de ballet Is included. Among
the singers are women who have made suc
cesses in Paris and various French and Italian
cities, but Misi Rogers is to be prima donna
assoluta. The opening is to be made in
"Faust." Miss Rogers makes her debut the
third night in "Samson and Delila." She is to
sing In eight different roles. Her costumes, all
new, are of the most luxurious description;
the jewels, crowns, bracelets, etc., made to
order, cost alone over 1500 francs. The cos
tumes will cost over 6000 francs. The prince
is a young, dark, fascinating man, but
serious; a musician, but not an executant,
who talks wisely and well of his venture,
which is largely "pour s'amuser." The the
ater is scarcely finished. The best is hoped for
the project and for all parties concerned. Miss
Rogers and her mother leave Paris for Jassy
to-day, August 27.
There Is no race, however uncivilized, that
is without its music, and it is through music
the savage finds his best expression of varied
passions. We even read, and know of, in
stances where music hns had the power of
charming and subduing wild beasts and
venomous reptiles. It is a significant fact
that after the close of the great Civil War,
when our Nation was torn asunder in memor
able strife, the Grand National Peace Jubilee,
held in Boston in June, 1869, assumed the
form of a musical festival. A chorus of over
10,000 voices and the harmony of more than
1000 instruments rolled forth' their sea of
sound, accompanied by the chiming of bells
and the boomlngof cannon, pouringout praise
and emulation at the restoration of peace
in the land, in loud hosannas, with all tne
grandeur and majesty of which music is capa
ble.
Amy Fay says: "To visit New York In sum
mer one would think it was the home of bad
music. An occasional hand organ played for
ten minutes used to be rather a pleasant thing;
but when one is daily besieged by four or five
mechanical pianos which are much louder in
tone and which play until they force one to
pay them to leave, it becomes a serious matter.
We don't mind one black, cat on our doorstep,
but when it becomes 'a million black cats,' as
the boy said, may heaven defend usl It is said
that in London one can never get out of the
sound of the hand organ."

STORY OF THE GOLDEN GATE.
Stockton Independent.
Joaquin Miller had an interesting contribu
tion in last Sunday's Call on "The Story and
the Glory of the Golden Gate." The object of
the article is to prove thai General Fremont
gave the title of Golden Gate to the entrance
to San Francisco Bay long before the advent of
the Argonauts. The Poet of the Sierras suc
ceeds in this quite conclusively, resurrecting a
map which had beeu made by Fremont previ
ou sto 1848, in which year it was printed.
The old poet follows General Fremont ud the
Contra Costa hills to the point whence the in
trepid explorer contemplated the beautiful
Golden Gate, where he gave it its name and
from which point of view he subsequently had
Bierstaat paint his famous picture of the mag
nificent gateway to the State's metropolis. Mr
Miller has rendered history a timely service in
publishing the interesting facts in connection
with the name oi the Golden Gate. Through
all the narrative crops out the poetic nature
of the writer,. Standing on the spot whence
Fremont drank in the inspiriug view Mr.

ABSOLUTELY PURE
Miller draws the following graphic picture of
the scene:
"It is noticeable that at each equinox the
sun, from this (Fremont's) point of view, falls
down exactly into the Golden Gate, and it is
always at such times incredibly vast, blocking
for a few moments the whole gate with iw
disk of gold. I once saw a black cloudâ black
as midnight and as boundlessâ hang above
this ball of gold as it rolled down Into tha
golden chasm of the Golden Gate. But the
sun. did not heed the cloud.
The cloud was only blacker from the bright
ness of the golden globe and the gate and the
walls of the gate and the bay and the city and
all the cities up and down, and thelslands and
the ships and indeed al! the world, the heavens
and the earth, all things save that awful night
mare of black cloud abo,ye the golden sun,
were for a moment nothing but molten gold.
Then the sun sank, sank suddenly into the
sea, as if it had, indeed, been a mighty ball of
gold and the blackness fell down as suddenly
in his place, and blackness was only black
ness, as if God himself had closed the gate with
a bang, and forever."

A LUMBER RAFT
FROM ASTORIA,
Towed to San Francisco by
the Steam Collier
Mineola.
THE VENTURE A SUCCESS
Thousands of Dollars Saved by
Floating the Timber to
This Port
BOARDING-MASTERS AT WAR.
Sailors More Than Plentiful and
Wages Being Cut in All
Directions.
Many attempts have been made to tow
rafts of lumber to San Francisco, but very
lew have been successful. During the last
year over half a dozen have been built,
but all, save two, have got away from the
steamers that bad them in tow and went
to pieces on the rock-bound coast of Men
doeino.
One of the twain got in yesterday, and
created a great deal of excitement on the
water front. It is 528 feet long, 51 feet
wide and 31 feet deep. It contains 450,000
feet of lumber, and draws 21 leet of
water, while the freeboard is 10 feet. On
this occasion the Southern Pacific plays in
luck, as the piles are to be used on its Oak
land water-front lots. On two previous
occasions the railroad company's rafts
have gone to pieces, and the ventures
proved to be a total loss.
The Mineola was five and three-quarter
days towing the raft from the Columbia
River. It was built at Stella, on the Wash
ington side of the river, and was towed to
the bar by one of the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company's boats. In order to
cross the bar extra power was required, so
the Spreckels' rug Relief was called into
service, and she towed the raft over the
obstruction and out to sea, where the
Mineola picked it up.
The report of Captain Pillsbury of the
Mineola is as follows:
On Thursday, August 20, at 6p. M., took raft
in tow off Columbia River lightship and pro
ceeded toward San Francisco with fair weather
and moderate variable winds, a heavy

Off Meiggs wharf the tugs Rescue and
Sea Queen showed up and Captain Pills

When abreast of Goat Island the Rescue
and Queen were joined by the Sea King
and Redmond and all four took com
mand. Before the towboats could secure
control the big raft had drifted danger- |
ously near to Long Wharf, Oakland.
Finally the Sea King and Rescue went j
ahead and the Sea Queen and Redmond
made fast astern. The latter boats steered I
the unwieldy mass and altogether they
finally landed it in Oakland Creek. There
it will be broken up and used just as de
sired. By safely landing the raft in San
Francisco bay the railroad company is
just $11, (XK3 ahead of the game.
Captain Luttrell of the schooner Vine,

Captain Luttrell will, inconsequence, have

There were lively times around Lom
bard-street wharf yesterday. The steamer
Ukiah cf the San Francisco and North
Pacific Railroad Company brought down
over 20CO ho.-s from Mendoeino and Marin
counties, and they were all landed on East
street about noon time. From that up to
4 p. m., there was a continual procession of
pigs along East and across Maiket to the
abattoirs. Every time a drove came along
the cars were stopped, and more oaths'
were uttered in live minutes than would
patch Kearny street. Out ot the entire
consignment only five died on tne way.
The United Sta"tes ship Alert came down
from Mare Island yesterday. She will re
main here for some time, as her crew has
to be recruited. Sailors are plentiful, but
they don't seem to appreciate service in
the navy. v
The Dutch ship Adnana, which sailed
from Santa Rosalia for Falmouth. Eng.,
some months ago, has put into Rio de
Janeiro in distress. Many of her sails
were blown out of the boltropes, her
main topgallant mast and jibboom were
carried away and her deck beams were
broken. The vessel was caught in a hurri
cane and came near foundering.
Trouble is brewincr on the wator front
among the boaiding-masters. Some of
the "runners" have more business than
the others and jealousy is rife. Last Tues
day night the'boats of Thomas Murray,
J. MeMahon, W. McCarthy and W.
Thompson were wrecked. The falls and
sails were cut to pieces and the oars and
boats were so damaged that it will be a
week before the owners can use them
again. Tne men named were known as
the "cut-rate boarding-masters," and a
preconcerted movement is on foot to drive
them out of business.

$2000 FOR A GOOD WIFE
Aaron Gartenberg Provided as Much in
His Will at the Time of His
Second Marriage.
The will of Aaron Gartenberg was filed
yesterday for probate. The value of his
estate is not known, but it is thought to be
large. In this will, dated February 11,
1891, is the following clause:
I give and bequeath unto Lena Goldberg,
residing in the City and County of San Fran
cisco, State of California, to whom lam this
day to be married, in consideration of her be
coming my wife and remaining a true and
faithful wife to me until my death, the sum of
$2000.
At tne time of the execution of the will
Gartenberg was 69 years of ace and had [
five grown children. ' His second wife was I
45 v ears of age.

Leiser Gartenberg, and sister, Zeirel. $250
each. The residue of the estate eoes to his
sons, Abraham, Max and Isaac Garten
berg, and his daughters, Betsy Harris and

just been remodeled and now present a
very attractive appearance. Handsome
signs inform passers by that the firm re

WILL BE CHARGED
WITH MURDER,
Louis Best, a Machinist,
Dies at the Receiving
Hospital.
HIS SKULL FRACTURED.
Three Young M n'Uoder Sus
picion of Having Knocked
Him Down.
ONE HAS LEFT THE CITY.
The Circumstances of the Assault,
Which Occurred on Tehama Street,
Wrapped in Mystery.
Louis Beit, a machinest residing at 330
Ritch street, was knocked down by three
I young men near his residence, on Tuesday
afternoon. He was a heavy man ana in
falling struck the sidewalk with the back
of his head, rie was picked up uncon
scious and carried into his house. He re
mained unconscious until yesterday after
noon, when his friends becoming alarmed,
bad him removed to the Receiving Hos
pital.
The doctors there came to the conclu sion
that he was suffering from a fractnred
skull. He remained in an unconscious
state till about 8 o'clock, last night when
he died and his body was removed to the
Morgue.
One of the young men who knocked
iJest down was arrested shortly after the
assault, and was taken to the Southern
police station by Policemen O'Connor and
Fay and booked on the charge of battery.
His name is Thomas I. Linsky, and he
works in a cannery on Brannun street.
Liinskv was removed to the City Prison
Tuesday evening, and at 10 o'clock was re
leased on giving $100 bonds. His case was
caliPd in Judge Gonlan's court ye-sterday
morning, but a continuance was granted
till to-day.
As soon as Captain Spillane learned of
Best's serious condition he instructed
O'Connor and Fuy to bring Linsky in so
as to hold him pending the result of
Best's injuries. They learned that Linsky
had yesterday morning sent in his time
card at the cannery and drawn his wages.
He had not been at his home and the po
lice were afraid that, learning of Best's
! critical condition, he had left the City.
Captain Spillane detailed other officers
who know Ltnsky on the case, and every
effort ia being made fo find him and the
two young men who were with him.
When arrested they will be charged with
murder.
A boy called at the Receiving Hospital
las night and said that after the young
men had knocked Best down they kicked
him on the head.
WORKMEN REJOICE.
Good Tidings fop the Granite-Cutters
and the Bakers.
The Granite-cutters' Union held an elec
tion last evening and the following offi
cers were selected for the ensuing term:
President, W. F. O'Donnell; vice-presi
dent, James Walker; treasurer, Charles
Coyle; secretary, John Grant. The latter
was also selected as a delegate to the
Building Trades Council. The member*
are rejoicing that the atone work on the
new driveway in Golden Gate Park is to
be done in this City. The work begins
next Monday, and will give employment
to thirty men for at least seven months.
The trouble between Bakers' Union 51
and Davitt & Daly's shop is nearlng a
settlement. Consent to the men joining
has already been given. Other details, as
to wages, etc., will be regulated on Satur
day. The bakers hope that good feeling
and harmony will prevail as a result of
this victory for the Labor Council and the
Bakers' Union. x
OLYMPIC CLUB DUES.
It I* Rumored That a 910 Assessment
Will Be Levied.
The Olympic Club directors met for the
last time last night in that capacity.
There were six present, viz., Eaton, Gunn,
Kelly, Owens, White, Bosworth and Gill.
The only business of importance transacted
related to a charge brought by F. V. King
ton, the champion heavy-weight wrestler
and prominent football player, against
Jack McGlynn, who, it is charged, offered
Kington a cash consideration to desert the
ranKs of the Olympic football team and
play with the Peerless football team, of
which McGlynn is manager. The matter
was tabled.
The new directors will take their seats
on Wednesday, September 9.
It was rumored around the club last
evening, that owing to the depleted condi
tion of the treasury and the many im
provements in the club that are necessary,
an assessment of $10 will be levied on the
members. The supposition is that a vigor
ous objection will be instituted against the
proposed assessment by some of the mem
bers, but as funds are very necessary, an
assessment will certainly be levied, or
otherwise a raise in the monthly dues of
the members most follow.
Dr. E. N. Short was voted a life mem
ber, as he had proposed sixty-three names
of gentlemen wbo were elected members
during the past year, thereby increasing
th- club's funds $630 in cash and $189 per
month, which ib the amount of dues re
ceived.
An English Vessel Libeled.
The British ship Brabloch was libeled by
J. J. Moore <fc Co. yesterday, in the Rum of
$9927 02. It is alleged in the complaint that
the vessel, which was loaded with coal from
Newcastle, caught fire at sea, sustaining
serious damage. When she reached this port
the libellants advanced the sum of $4737 66
to the master, which he used in paying towage
aud repairing bis snip. The second count
alleges that the master, D. Kiddie, has failed
to account for coal to the value of $5289 36,
and a judgment is asked for that amount.
The Brabloch is about to leave for a foreign
port without paying the amounts claimed by
Moore & Co., hence the suit. It is thought that
the owners will settle the claim this morning.

A BIG MORTGAGE
FORECLOSURE,
The Hibernia Savings and
Loan Society Sues W.
H. Howard.
OVER $150,000 INVOLVED
The Property Covered Is Located
on Clay and Montgomery
Streets.
PROVISION FOB A EECEIVEB.
Interest Has Been in Default for
More Than Seventeen
Months-
Suit was entered yesterday by the Hiber
nia Savings and Loan Society to foreclose
a mortgage for $150, Q00 held against prop
erty owned by William H. Howard.
The loan was made on the 12th of Decem
ber, 1888, on a mortgage and the accom
panying promissory note. The property
mortgaged lies in different parts of the
City â one piece on Second street, north
side, near Natoma, another on Natoma

ard street near Second, another on Second
street near Natoma and another on Natoma
near Second; another on Howard near
Second, another on First street near Mis
sion, another on Montgomery street near
Clay and another on Clay street near San
some.
The interest on the mortgage has been
in default since March 12, 1895, and pay
ment has been demanded of the interest
and of the promissory note; but botn have
remained unpaid, hence the suit.
Tne terms of tne mortgage r quire that
in such default a receiver be appointed to
collect the rents of the mortgaged" prop
erty and apply the net proceeds of the
same to the payment of any deficit that
may remain to the plaintiff after the sale
of the mortgaged property.
Also by the terras of the mortgage the
buildings on the property were to be kept
insured for the security of the mortgagee
in the sum of $15,000, and the mortgagor
failing to effect such insurance the mort
gaeee might do so, the mortgagor being
liable for the cost of the same. This had
been done by the mortgagee, and the sum
was still due, together with interest at
the rate of 2 per cent per month.
JUDGE PROMISES SPEED
Argument on the Demurrer in
the Case of the " Solid
Seven."
The Points Pro and Con Made by
Genera' Dickinson and Dis
trict Attorneys.
Argnments on the demurrer to the in
dictments of the seven Supervisors by the
Grand Jury were beard yesterday fore
noon by Judge Seawell, the accusation
against the Supervisors being willful and
corrupt malfeasance in office in reducing
the assessments of several large corpora
tions.
None of the Supervisors were present,
and it was not a phase of the celebrated
case which attracted or interested a large
audience. General John H. Dickinson
represented the Supervisors, and the in
terests of the people were looked after by
District Attorney Barnes and Assistant
District Attorney Hosmer.
General Dickinson stated his objections
to tne complaint, and argued that it was
defective in that there was a misjoinder of
paities because only seven of the Board of
Supervisors were accused. He contended
that as the board consists of twelve mem
bers, the charges should have been placed
at the door of the whole board and the
seven alleged 10 be guilty picked out after
ward. He also argued that the indict
ment was insufficient because it charged
only general corruption -and made no
showing of specific wrong-doing, and that
it was defective because more than one
offense was charged therein.
District Attorney Barnea opposed the
points made by the Supervisors' attorney.
He claimed that under several Supreme
Court decisions and the code as many
charges as were considered necessary could
be made in support of an accusation of
corruption. He held that a proceeding of
this kind is an impeachment, and that a
wide latitude of accusations is proper. He
contended that there had been no misjoin
der of parties because the charge was made
individually in their capacity as officials

as to whether the prosecution would be

SHE LOST JACOB
AND HER MONEY.
The Old Story of a Confid
ing Woman and a
Rascal.
TWO DAYS' HONEYMOON.
Result of Getting Married
Through an Advertisement
in a Newspaper.
MRS. BARBARA BOSSERT DUPED
She Was Wedded to Jacob Schmidt on
Saturday and Is Now After Him
for Felony Embezzlement.
Mra. Barbara Bossert, a widow living at
103 Langton street, is mourning the loss
of her second husband and $1240 in crisp
greenbacks, which she confidingly intrust
ed to his care.
It is the old story of a clever rascal lay
ing a trap for a woman with money in
search of a husband and even going the
length of marrying her to accomplish his
purpose.
On Friday last Mrs. Bossert saw an ad
vertisement in the German Demokrat,
which read that a widower, 40 years of
pge, worth $15,000 and having no child
ren, desired to marry a German lady.
She answered the advertisement, giving
the address of 553 Minna street, which is
a grocery owned by John M. Kunz, her
son-in-law.
That night a man called at the store
and introduced himself as Jacob Schmidt,
paying that he was the advertiser. Mrs.
Bossert was there and they were soon in
earnest conversation. Schmjdt told her
he owned the Turk-street Beer Hall, 30
Turk street, and adjoining property. His
â¢wife died in Cnicago about two years ago,
where he had been in the saloon business,
and as he felt lonely be wanted a partner
to share his joys and his sorrows. He did
not want money ; all he wanted was a wife
who would make him happy, and he felt
pure that Mrs. Bossert was just the one to
suit him.
Mrs. Bossert was flattered by his talk
and before Schmidt toofc his departure it
was arranged they should get married the
following day. So on Saturday they went
to the City Hall and Schmidt procured
the marriage license. Then they went to
Justice of the Peace Groezinger, and he
Eoon made them husband and wife.
They went to 108 Langton street to spend
the honeymoon. On Monday morning
the bride felt so happy that she told
Schmidt that she had $1240 in the house,
so he did not marry a penniless woman.
Schmidt said it was very dangerous for her
to keep such a large sum of money in the
house as burglars might hear of it and
taKe it away from her. This scared her,
and she gave him the $1240, all in green
backs, and asked him to take it to the
German Savings Bank and deposit it in
her name. Jacob put on his hat, kissed
her good-by and that was the last she saw
of him.
Monday night passed and Jacob did not
return ; then Tuesday passed without his
appearance and she became alarmed. She
sent her son-in-law to the Turk-street
beer hall to inquire for Jacob, but nobody
knew anything about him. Kunz hur
ried back to his mother-in-law, and to
gether they went to Judge Conlan's court,
whejje she swore to a complaint charging
Jacob with felony embezzlement. The
warrant was placed in the hands of De
tective Anthony, but Jacob has not been
found.
Mrs. Bossert is a buxom woman about
MRS. BARBARA BOSSERT.
40 years ol age, and can only speat the
German language. She came here about
four months ago with her daughter and
son-in-law from Brooklyn. N. V., where
her husband died a little'over a year ago.
She is a simple, confiding woman. She
uoes not regret the loss of Schmidt, but
feels keenly the loss of her money, as it
was all the wealth she was possessed ot.
Schmidt is described as a German about
36 years of age, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches tall,
dark hair and eyes, slight black mustache,
mutton-chop whiskers and high forehead.
He has a full round face, rather stout
build, and is considered a handsome man.
About ten days ago Schmidt rented a
room in the lodgine-nouse 32 Turk street,
kept by Mrs. Turner, which is over
the Turk-street beer hall. He paid
her a month's rent in advance. He
told her be had been in the saloon
business in Chicago for twelve years, and
was now interested in a gold mine in this
Slate. He wore a shabby gray suit and
nil his personal effects were contained in
two valises. He said he had only been
here a few weeks and bad been stopping
in a hotel on Eddy street.
Last Saturday morning he left with one
of his valises, telling Mrs. Turner in a
note that he was going to Sacramento to
see about the gold mine. He returned
Monday morning about 10 o'clock, packed
up bis effects and left with both valises,
explaining to Mrs. Turner that he was
a^ain going to Sacramento and would be
away for some days. That was the last
eeen of him. The probability is that he
has left the State.
He must have had some money, as a
few days after he went to Mrs. Turner's
he bought several suits of rlothes. She
observed that he wore two diamond rings
on his fingers,

THE WILLIAMS TRIAL.
The Evidence for the Defense Is
Not as Strong as Was
Supposed.
The Government Is Investigating an
Alleged Attempt to Bribe
Witnesses.
The trial of Dick Williams, charged
with fraudulently landing Chinese, was
resumed in the Onited States District
Court yesterday. With the testimony of
George E. Lawrence, attorney for Mrs.
Williams in the divorce proceedings, and
Deputy Collector Jerome relative to the
finances of the accused the Government
rested its case.
Wong Sam was recalled for cross-exam
ination, Mowry directing a perfect fusillade
of questions tending to show that the wit
ness had conspired to cause the arrest of
Williams. He was asked if Major Moore
had not promised him immunity from
prosecution if he would muke certain affi
davits against Williams. No such thing
had occurred, however, and the defense
was compelled to rely on its own wit
nesses.
Incidentally, it may be remarked that
Major Moore made every possible effort
to have Wong Sam indicted by the last
Grand Jury, but failed. Tne allegations
were thoroughly investigated, but found
to be so largely hearsay as not to warrant
serious consideration.
The defense introduced five witnesses
during the day, but the testimony offered
was not of a particularly startling or
convincing character. Wong Chee, Jen
Quong, Dong Doc Ho and Chin Toy all
denied having paid Williams money to
land Chinese; neither were they aware
that such a thing had been done.
The last witness offered before adjourn
ment was Ham Teung. The defense evi
dently expected great things of him., but
it was doomed to disappointment. The
witness was exceedingly nervous, and
seemed suddenly to have lost his memory.
He recalled having talked with Wong Sam
on two occasions concerning Williams'
honesty, but more than this, he could not
â¢remember. Attorney Mowry suggested
that Teung was intimidated by the
presence of some one in the courtroom,
but this the witness stoutly denied. Judge
Morrow took a hand in the proceedings
but ceveloped nothing further than that
the witness was inspector for the Chinese
Association. Court adjourned at 4 o'clock
with Teung still on the stand. He will be
the first witness called this morning.
During the afternoon session Mrs. Wil
liams flitted into the court. She gave a
withering elance at the man on trial,
smiled sweetly at the prosecuting attor
neys', and then melted through the big
oak doors leading into the corridors.
Chin Ying has reported to the prosecu
tion that on Wednesday last Quong Him
offered him $50 if he would leave the City
and not testify against Williams. If
Ying's charges can be established the*
matter will be laid before the United
States Grand Jury.
Quong Him, formerly interpreter in the
Chinese Bureau, and more familiarly
known as Charley Him, is a Mongol whose
career is well known. It will be remem
bered that a full account of Him's connec
tion with a famous case in Los Angeles
was published several months ago. Him
kept his wife confined in a dry well for
two weetts, intending thereafter to sell her
into slavery. He has during the progress
of the trial sat by Williams' side and has
always closely watched every bit of evi
dence produced.
It is said that a good railway engine will
travel 1,000,000 miles beiore it is worn out.

dians and many ienorant Mexicans have
followed with blind devotion even unto
death, and the Nemesis of the Mexican
Government, against which she has in
cited a war, has decided to forsake the
home of her followers, who idolize her,
and will become a museum freakâ a
passive figure seated on a platform for the
curious populace to gaze on at so much a
head.
Her manager and the person who ex
pects to profit most by her powers of
attracting the nimble dime is Dr. A. G.
Huff, who for several years has been a
practicing physician of this City.
Several weeks ago when the excitement
along the Mexican border was at its
height Dr. Huff 'conceived the idea that
the fair Teresa would be a drawing-card
as a theatrical attraction and wrote to a
friend in Arizona asking him to ascertain
whether she could be induced to leave her
home to journey to the United States to
give the longing populace a chance to see
her. Of course this was the only light in
which the matter was to be placed oelore
her.
At this time the excitement was at its
height. The Nogales Custom-house, just
scross the Mexican border, had been at
tacked by Teresa's followers, seven of
them killed, and the Gonora witch was
too busily explaining that she was for
peace and not for war and riot to think of
leaving her native heatti. 80 the nego
tiations for the time being came to naught.
Dr. Huff was not to be baffled, however,
and telegraphed to a friend, a Spanish
lawyer at LO3 Angeles, to go to Mexico and
see what could be done toward inducing
the girl to change her mind. Apparently
he succeeded better than his predecessors,
for a few days ago Dr. Huff received word
that a bargain had been made and that
funds were all that were needed to start
her on her way to pecuniary fame and for
tune.
To be sure that everything was all right
Dr. Huff started at once for Mexico and
is now arranging for her tour.
It has not yet been decided whether the
mystic Teresa will start her career as a
freak in New York or San Francisco, but
in any event she will soon be before the
footlights as a star attraction. Dr. Huff |
expects to make a fortune out of his
venture, particularly if the fair Teresa
proves to have tne wonderful powers at
tributed to her by her followers.

Mrs. Rafael Silva Thereby
Loses Thousands of
Dollars.
LEFT HER DOOR AJAR.
A Bag of Precious Jewels Left
Unprotected From Sneak
thieves.
ONLY ONE CASE WAS TAKEN
Through Ignorance or Fear the Bur
glars Overlooked More Than
They Took.
Mrs. Rafael de la Silva, a wealthy Mexi
can lady, whose husband, she claim?, is
'he Pooh Bah of La Paz and nas so many
remunerative offices that he has to gather
in his salary of depreciated currency each
month in a barrel, has had a painful ex
perience of the woes that may befall a be
jeweled and unsophisticated woman in a
wide-awake American city.
Mrs. Silva came to this City a few
months ago and upon the recommenda
tion of friends took up her residence at
the Lariston, 621 Bush street. Mrs. Silva
could speak no English, but to the few
persons who could understand her tongue
she unburdened herself freely. Among
her proud possessions was a choice assort
ment of diamonds. These she exhibited
to her Spanish-speaking iriends and de
clared that they were worth $10,000. In
this way the story of her wealth soon be
came public property in the neighborhood.
A short time after Mrs. Silva's advent at
the Lariston she formed the acquaintance
of Peter Salvador, the Italian cook who
runs the culinary department of the hos
telry as an independent venture. Peter
could speak Spanish almost as well as his
mother tongue, and he soon won his way
into the good graces of the opulent dame
from the South. Mrs. Silva had about
made up her mind that this town waÃ
good enough for her, and wnen the master
of salads and sauces represented to her
the gaudy profits to be made out of cater
ing to the appetites of Lariston patrons
Mrs. de la Silva readily consented to place
a portion of her coin and all her confidence
in the boarding business.
It was while engaged in the plebeian
bnsiness of tending the dining-room, a
calling which would have made the
haughty Don Rafael's blood turn cold,
that Mrs. Silva came to grief.
According to her story as told through
Peter Salvador as interpreter Mrs. Silva,
with the reckless disregard of wealth
characteristic of the Southern Jadies, left
her diamond cases in a sack on a shelf in
her closet while she went to tend the din
ing-room during Her partner's daily mar
keting. In spite of the large amount of
jewelry in the room she did not even take
the precaution to lock the door. Her
room is near the front entrance of the
house and dozens of strangers pass her
door in an hour. One of the chamber
maids noticing the door was unlocked
notified Salvador of the fact, but he didn't
consider the matter of enough importance
to speak to Mrs. Silva.
About 1 o'clock in the afternoon
Mrs. Siiva returned to her room
and noticing that the door of her closet
was open glanced toward the bag of gem;.
The mouth of the bag was open, but other
wise nothing appeared disturbed. A fur
ther investigation, however, revealed the
fact that one of the jewel cases had been
opened and a pair of diamond bracelets,
valued at $2200, and a pair of earrings,
valued at $500, had been extracted. The
remainder of the $10,000 worth of diamonds
was in the same bag, as was also $20 in
gold, but nothing else was taken.
The police were at once notified and
made a thorough investigation of the
premises. The domestics in the house
have all been with the landlady, Mrs.
Sheridan, for several years, and she ex
pressed the utmost faith in their integrity.
The detectives searched all their rooms
and questioned them closely, but all were
able to give satisfactory accounts of them
selves. The notoriety which Mrs. Silva's
Dossessions had gained, and the advan
tages which her carelessness and the po
sition of her room presented for looting
make it improbable that the wife of Rafael
de la Silva "will ever resain the jewels
which she says she has lost.

AND CONTRACTS,
Two Witnesses Testify
, Strongly for Mrs.
Craven.
COUNSEL OF SULLIVAN.
The Ex-Judge Cautioned the Fair
Litigant Against Marriage
by Agreement.
KNEW HIS CLIENT'S INTENT.
A Former Landlady of the School
Principal Contributes Valuable
Evidence.
It was only a side is.me in which tbe de
positions of ex-Jadge J. F. Sullivau and
Mrs. Sarah B. Johnson were taken in the
offices of De'mas <fc Shortridge yesterday,
but tne sworn statements of these two wit
nesses developed some of the most im
portant testimony yet brought to light in
the various ramifications of the great Fair
will litigation.
Ex-Judge Sullivan testified to the fact
that Mrs. Craven, as early as 1892, had
consulted him as to the character and
effect of a contract marriage; that she had
informed him of her contemplated, mar
riage by contract to Senator James G.
Fair, and that she had exhibited a paper
to him which he understood to be a con
tract of marriage between herself and
Senator Fair. He was not, however, pre
pared to make oath, he said, as to whether
this contract bore the signatures of the
parties or not He refused to state either
that it was signed or that it was not.
Mrs. Johnson not only testified that she
had seen the Fair-Craven contract of mar
riage, bnt that she bad seen the respective
signatures attached to tbe document She
also testified to private visits of the Sena
tor to Mrs. Craven while the iatter was at
tbe Colonial House, a boarding and lodg
ing house conducted by tho witness at the
of Pine and Jones streets.
Mrs. Craven, sac said, had made a con
fidant of her and had told tier of her
secret marriage to the millionaire, and had
a. so shown her the deeds to the properties
on Pine and Sansome streets and on Mis
sion and Eleventh streets. Mrs. Craven
had also told her of how she had induced
the Senator to leave 150,000 for the benefit
o: the school-teachers.
Altogether it was a day of congratula
tion for Mrs. Craven and the cross-exam
ination of tbe witnesses by the attorney
representing the opposing side failed to
mar the value of the testimony given in
the slightest degree.
These depositions were taken in the
case of James 8. Angus et al. vs. Nettie R.
Craven etai., in the suit brought by the
special administrators to quiet title to the
property covered by the deeds recently re
corded by Mrs. Craven's attorneys, and
by which Senator Fair conveyed "to that
lady th<* property on the corner of San
eome and Pine streets and that on Mission
and Eleventh streets.
D. M. Deimas oi Deimas & Shortridge
represented Mrs. Craven and William
Pierson of Pierson <fe Mitchell appeared on
behalf of the special administrators.
Ex-Judge Sullivan in response to ques
tions asked by Mr. Deimas stated that he
is 45 years of age and a resident of San
Francisco since December, 1S61; that he is
a Jawyer by profession; has been practic
ing since June 10. 1374, and that he was
admitted to the bar in January of that
year. He added that he was elected a Su
perior Judge in September, 1879, taking
office on the firsi Monday in January,
1880, and that he held that office during
portions of three terms, until August,
wnen he resigned and resumed the
practice of his profession. He further
Etated that he was still in practice and is
now the senior member of the nrm of Sul
livan <fc Sullivan.
Tbe examination was then continued as
follows:
"Do you know the defendant, Nettie E.
Craven?"
"I do."
'How long have you known her?"
ice 1878, I think it is. I know it
was during my term as a member of the
Board of Education of this City that 1
met her. I was then introduced to her, or
she was introduced to me, Dy a letter of
introduction from William P. Dainger
field, at that time a District Judge sitting
in this County."
'After you had resigned from the bench
in 1889, did you at any time act profes
sionally as tbe legal adviser or attorney
for Mrs. Craven?"
'Idid?"
'Commencing in wuat year, if you re
member?'
â¢I think in 1300. It was either in the
latter part of IS?9 or along in the year
I*9o. 1 think it was in 1890, in connection
with the guardianship of iier daughter."
Witness then told of the different cases
in which he acted as .the legal representa
tive of Mrs. Craven, and the further ex-,
animation elicited the following:
"Do you remembar, Jadge, while you
â were thus acting as the le^al adviser and
attorney of Mrs. Craven wn ether she ever
consulted you in any way about a contem
plated marriage with Senator James G.
Fair?"
"I remember that she did."
"Will you please state the whole of the
consultations, as you recall them."
"Mrs. Craven said to mo on one occa
sion, tbe date of which I cannot remem
ber, but I think it was in 1892, that Sena
tor Fair desired her to enter into a mar
riage contract with him. She wished to
know from me if contract marriages were
valid. I told her that that was a matter
that hod engaged some very serious
thought among the members of the bar
and seme divided judgments among tbe
members of the bench in this State; that,
us I considered, of th* two decibions which
had been made in the Sharon case, the
second or later oae on appeal from tbe
order denying a new trial was
at variance with the first. I told her
that contract marriages were danger
ous things and uncertain and aiffi
cult to establish, and I advised her
against entering into any such relation
ship, and she wanted to know if any par
ticular form was requisite in an agree
ment or contract of marriage. I told her
nothing further than to show that each
party deliberately took tbe other to be his
and "her spouse; that no set form of
phraseology was requisite for that, inso
far as the agreement should be a part of
the marriage; any form that would show
that each party took the other for the
husband or wife would be sufficient. My
recollection of tbe matter is not confined
to a particular date. My recollection is
that Mrs. Ciaven spoke to me on several
occasions, twice or three time!, and some
of these matters may have been stated
at one time or at another during
these conferences. I would say fur
ther, in this connection, that my
recollection of particular dates and
occurrences at this time is affected by the J
fact that I was then, unfortunately for
f, unduly active in political matter.-, :
nayinz, perhaps, more attention to those i
thing* tnan I was to my business. So for
that reason I cannot recollect dates par
ticularly, and I have amoDg my books and
papers no memoranda by which I can fix
the date. In one of the talks that Mrs.
Craven had with me she asKed me whether
it was necessary that the contract mar
riage should be acknowledged. I told her
that in my opinion acknowledgment be
fore a notary was not requisite to an
agreement or contract of marriage; that
the law made no provision directly
upon than subject; "but that in view
of the uncertainty and danger that at
tends contracts and agreements of that
kind, it was a matter of paramount im
portance to her, if she could have it, to
have the paper acknowledged before an
officer, because ati evidence of that ac
knowledgement would tend toward the
establishment of that agreement, if made,
and would be in aid of her owntestimony
and in support of the contract."
"Did she at that time, Judge, exhibit to
you what purported to be a marriage con
tract between her and Senator Fair?"
Mr. Pierson objected to this question as
being leading, but the witness replied
nevertheless as follows:
â¢'She did either at that time or at a subse
quent time. She did *t one of these talks
or conferences exhibit to me a paper in the
form of an agreement of marriage between
her and Senator Fair."
Mr. Pierson insisted on his objection and
Mr. Deimas then put his question in the
following form:
"I will ask you then whether at any of
these conversations Mrs. Craven exhibited
to you any papers?"
"Mrs. Craven did exhibit to me atone of
these talks a paper writing."
"Can yon state from your recollection
what tr/at paper was or purported to be?"
"The paper in question purported to be
an agreement, a short statement, 'I agree
to take Nettie R. Craven to be my wife,'
or something to that effect, 'and I take ]
James G. Fair to be my husband.' My
impression at this time is that she wished
to know if tuat was sufficient in form; if i
that was a proper form."
"Do you have any recollection whether
that paper was signed, or purported to be
signed by either of the parties?' 1
"That is a matter upon which my mind
is not clear. The matter that was on my |
EX-JUDGE J. F. SULLIVAN.
j mihd, for the purpose of advising her, was ]
I to satisfy her that any form by which !
; each party distinctly stated that he or she
j took tbe other was sufficient, and the
| further matter as to whether or not a pa
per of that kind, to be effective as such,
required acknowledgment. My mind is
not clear now on tbe proposition as to
whether tbe paper was or was no: signed.
I couldn't say that it was; I can't say that
it was not."
"Did she in that connection, Judge, in
asking you your advice and directions,
make mention of Senator Fair?"
"She did."
"What did she say?"
"Well, I knew from her statement at
that time, or at another time, or from the
paper itself, tbat the intended marriage ;
contract waa to be between her and
Senator Fair. Whether she stated to me
that at that time or whether it was read
to me from the paper at tbat time I do not
now recollect. Of course this matter was
over four years ago and I made no mem- ,
orandnm. I did uot prepare the paper." j
"What I intend to direct your attention )
to particularly is whether in that conver
â fttJon, when she showed you the paper
and spoke about an acknowledgement, i
she made mention of a meeting thereafter j
to bt had between her and Senator Fair?" !
"She did."
"Will you please state what she said."
"She said tbat she was in a hurry about ,
it because she had an appointment to meet
the party and had to act hurriedly."
"Was that the last conversation that i
you recall having had upon that subject,
touching the marriage, in the year 1892,
with Mrs. Craven?"
"That is the last conversation- In that j
connection, occurring during that year :
that I now recall. I have an impression
that these talks occurred at about the .
time that Mrs. Craven was actively en
gaged in preparing a public entertainment ;
by the children of her school. It was
about tbe time of tbe closing of the
schools. 1 think the schools were closed |
In the latter part of May."
This closed the direct examination by j
Mr. Deimas, who turned the witness over â¢
to Mr. P.erson.
Under cross-examination the witness !
stated that these interviews extended over
t period of about two months, dating :
from the first talk upon the subject. Wit- J
ness further stated that the handwriting '
of tbe body of the marriage contract tub- j
mitted to him was tbat of Mrs. Craven, I
and tbat no one was present except dim- I
self and Mrs. Craven when thia paper was i
shown him.
Mr. Pierson then asked this significant
question:
"Did you understand tbat the paper ex- j
hihited to you was some executed docu
ment of a marriage that had been con
summated or was only a proposed mar- ;
riage contract?"
To this the witness cautiously replied:
"That would involve, I suppose, the i
question whether or not the paper at tbat
time bore the signatures of both parties.
As to whether it was an executed contract
or not I have endeavored to refresh my {
recollection. I have talked with counsel
about it and I have talked with Mrs.
Craven about it, to see if I could fix in my
mind an impression to enable me to say
under oath just exactly what the fact's j
were in that connection. 1 desire to stats the j
facts as fully as I car. recall them, a:id the !
condition oi my mind on that subject is
just exactly as I have stated it to Mr. Del
mas- I can't say that I have a distinct
impression on my mind in regard to that
question â whether or not there were on
tbat paper the signatures of Air. Fair and
Mrs. Craven at that time; neither can I
pay that they were not there. I have an ;
impression on my mind that she was
about to see him and that the matter of !
tbe acknowledgement of tbe paper was a
pending matter, and that she left nsy of
fice intending to see him and take some

further action with reference to tnat paper
in the matter of acknowledgement."
"She bad been consulting you in those
three or more interviews with a view to a
projected marriage, had she not?" asked
Mr. Pierson.
"She had talked with me of an intended
marriage or suggested marriage," replied
the witness.
"She had not consulted you as to the
validity of an existing marriage, had
she?'
"My recollection is that it was a con
templated marriage. ''
This concluded Judge Sullivan's ex
amination, and Mrs. Sarah B. Johnson,
who conducts the Colonial House, at the
corner of Jones and Pine streets, was
called.
Mrs. Johnson is a middle-aged lady
with the demeanor and repose of one
accustomed to refined society. She was
neatly and elegantly attired, and in excel
lent taste. Her testimony was given with
a deliberation and self-possession that
added great weight to its value.
StM stated that she had lived at the
Colonial House for eleven or twelve years;
that she had been a resident of the State
since 1859. and tbat she had assumed con
trol of the Colonial on the Ist of August,
1891.
â¢â Do you know Mrs. Craven?" asked Mr.
Deimas.
"I bave known her since either 1876 or
1877. I met her first in Oakland. We
were both living there," answered the lady.
"Are you intimate friends ?"
"You opened the Colonial in 1891?"
"Five years ago on the Ist of August.
Mrs. Craven was a boarder there wnen 1
opened the house. She continued there
until the last of November. She was ill
during that time. 1 procured a nurse for
her. She was so ill that sne drafted her
will, Judge Sullivan acting for her. I
never saw Senator Fair at my house dur
ing this time. I know that he cailed only
from the nurse, Mrs. Cossack."
"Are there one or more entrances to
your house?"
"Two â the main entrance on Pine street
and the side entrance on Jones street.
Mr?. Craven's room was at the bead of the
side stairs leading into the main hall.
When Mr?. Craven sa:d she was corning
back to my house to board I said I would
netc t approve of Senator Fair visiting her in
my house."
â¢'Wijen was this conversation?"
"A year after she left the house."
'You had made no remonstrance to her
when she was in your Louse before?' 1
"JFo; I did cot know of her relation to
him."
"After she left your house, did Mrs. Cra
ven come to your house and spend the ;
night?"
"Yes. She always slept in my room
with me on these occasions."
â¢'Did you speak to her of a marriage
betwean her and Senator Fair?"
"She told me she had a marriage con
tract with him. She showed me the paper,
which she was in the habit of carrying in
a little black satchel. I told her this wes
careless. I didn't read the paper. She
read part of it to me. I don't remember i
the exact substance of it. I saw this paper I
a number of times. Once she thought she
had lost it. She used to put it under her
pillow."
"What did she say of the non-publicity
of the marriaze contract?"
"I urged her to have it recorded. She
said neither of them wished to have it
public; th3t they were going abroad as
soon as they arranged their affairs. I told
her that I did not approve of marriage
contracts."
"It was after this she wanted to be a
boarder at your house again?"
'â¢Yes. She never returned as a boarder
again/
"Did you see enough of the paper to see
whether it was signed or not?"
"Yea. She showed me the signatures,
in different handwritings."
"In the conversation with her was any
thin. t' said about a provision for her sup
port?"
"When Senator Fair became ill, she said
Senator Fair was a much sicker man than
people thought; that he was going to give
her property which would provide for her
for life, and net cause any publicity after
his death. She came to my house one
day and said that Senator Fair made his
will at her house when she was living on
California street. She said he would deed i
her property, but she would not be named
in the will. That conversation took place
on the Sacramento-street car one morning
when I was going to Tiburon. She said
he had deeded to her the property;on San
some and Pine strsets and on Mission and
Eleventh."
"What did she tell you of the deeds he
gave her? '
"She showed them to me one night. I
asked her why she did not have them re
corded. I did not open the deeds. They
were folded as deeas usnally are and Had
the appearance of deeds."
"When you remonstrated with her on
the secrecy of her marriage, did you
speak to her of what would happea if he
should die?"
"She said in that case she would be ail
right."
"She said that a clause for the teachers
had Deen put in his will?"
"She said that she had urged him to
leave them $30,000."
"When did she show you these deeds?"
"I aon't remember. It was before his
death."
"Did yon see enough of these deeds to
know if they were acknowledged or not?"
"I did not."
Mr. Pierson here took cp the cross-ex
amination.
"How do you remember the date Mrs.
Craven left the bouse?"
"She had a dispute with one of the
ladies about a party to occur on Thanks
giving, and she leit in consequence of this
dispute."
"Why were you surprised at Senator
Fair visitine Mrs. Crayen 7"
"She knew that I didn't approve of her
friendship with Senator Fair."
"What'was there improper in his visit
ing your house? '
"I knew that he had not a good reputa
tion."
"Some time within a year after she left
she told you she bad a marriage contract
with Senator Fair?"
"Yes. I don't remember she exact
date."
"When did she apply to you to come
back to your house?'
"More than a year after sh* left.
"Why did you object to Senator Fair's
visiting her if she was married to him?"
"It was not public. The world did not
know it."
"Where was she living at that time?"
"She went to a flat on Butter street."
"Was she living there when she wanted
to come back?"
"I don't know."
"She was teaching all that timer'
''Bhe has been teaching ever since I nave
known her."
"Can you tell the time when^ she showed
the marriage contract to you?"
"No."
"Was the paper that she produced
folded?"
"Yes. It was almost 8 square package.
It was not in an envelope, and had the ap
| pearance of being soiled. I saw the two
i signatures. It was the first time I had
seen Senator Fair's writing. She did not
show me tbe deeds until long after, a few
months Defore Mr. Fair's death."
"How were tney folded?"
"In a double fold, like ordinary deeds.
They were not in envelopes. They were
fresh, but showed heavy creases. "I saw
some writing on the back of the deeds, but
! I did not notice them. She showed them
to me in my room on going to bed."
"How many times did she stay with you
that wÂ»yt"
"More than ten times and less than a
hundred."
"Why did she come?"
'Naturally, I suppose, because she cared
to see me."
"When was it that you asked her if Mr.
Fair had made any provision for her?"
"That was a year or a year and a half
before his death."
"She told you that Senator Fair was
going to deed' her some property?"
"Yes."
"When did she sar that he had deeded
it to her?"
"I think it was about three or four
months before his death."
"How do you fix that time?"
"I remember it was after I had the con
versation with her on the streetcar. That
I know was in tbe fall of 1894."
"How did she happen to show you those
deeds ?''
"As she undressed she took them out of
ber bosom. That was only a short time
before Senator Fair's death. It might
have been six or eight weeks."
"Do you know Senator Fair."
"I spoke to him only once."
"Did you ever see tbe Senator at her
hou-e?' 7
"No."
"Did she tell any one else of the mar
riage contract?"
"I don't know. She told it as a secret."
"Have you ever mentioned the subject
of this marriage contract to any one?"
"Not until after it was mentioned in the
papers."
"Have you spoken to Mrs. Craven in re
gard to your testimony?"
"No."
This endÂ»d the deposition of Afrs.
Johnson and the proceedings for the day.
WASHINGTON ALL RIGHT
Ex-Superior Judge Hunter Says
It Will Go Republican
by 15,000.
He Thinks Oregon Will Also Go Re
pub icanâ Jlany Voters Are
Changin? Over. .
Ex-Superior Judge E. F. Hunter of
Lewis County, Washington, whose home
is at Chehalis, is at the Grand. Ihe
Judge was formerly a Californian and re
sided twenty years in Tuolumne County.
Then he returned to Ohio and resided
eighteen years in Fairfield County and at
Chilicothe. In IS3S he moved to Wash
ington and has beÂ«n there e?er since.
He is now here on legal business in con
nection with the settlement of claims
against tbe firm of Holbrooks, Grigg &
Doenbucber, who formerly owned a large
furniture factory at Cbehalis and had a
storage-house on Mission street. Some of
the firm owned a bank at Chehalis, which
lately failed. The bouse owed the bank,
the Judge says. $27,500.
Asked as to how Washington would go
politically he said:
'â If you ask for my personal opinion I
will tell you I think it will go for McKin
ley by i 5,000 majority. I bave talked
lately with a good many men formerly
Republicans wbo in recent years have
been acting with the Populists. They
have got around to a point where they
say they won't do it any longer. They
think it has been a scheme to ruin the Re
publican party. Western Washington
will, in my judgment, go Republican by a
large majority, and I believe it will be the
same all over the State.
"As to Oregon, I think that is all right,
too. I believe it will po Republican."
Judge Hunter will be here for several
days in connection with his business. He
says business is very dull in Washington.
LEROY HARVEY'S TRIM,
The Mother of the Prosecuting
Witness Corroborates Her
Testimony.
Officers of the Company Testify That
He Had the Stock Transferred
en the Books.
The trial of Leroy G. Harvey, stock
broker, charged with the embezzlement of
seventy-five shares of stock of the Oakland
Gas Licht and Heat Company, the prop
erty of Miss Maud Smith, was on before
Judge Babrs yesterday. The mother of
the prosecuting witness corroborated the
testimony of her daughter, to the effect
that the stock was transferred to Harvey
upon his personal and earnest solicitation,
tbat he might appear as a man of means
in the eyes cf certain Eastern capitalists,
witb whom tie was to have tome impor
tant business dealings.
A. F. Eastland, assistant secretary of
the Oakland Gas Light and Heat Com
pany, testified tbat Harvey came to the
San Francisco office of the company, and,
presenting the certificate given him by
Miss Smith in blank, asked to have tbe
shares transferred to him on the booss of
the company. The indorsement was made.
The prosecution claims that this shows
the criminal intent of the defendant.
J. A. Briton, secretary of the company,
was called for the purpose of showing thut
Harvey had sold the stock as chargeo. Mr.
Briton was not in court, and an adjourn
ment was taken uutil this morning, when
be will be required to tell his story.

FAMOUS TEXAS OFFICERS,
Marshal Ware and Attorney
Cuibertson Pay a Visit
to This City.
The Work of the Rangers and the
Condition of Politics in the
Lon? St3r State.
Unitej! States Attorney Robert N. Cui
bertson of the western district of Texas
and Colonel R. C. Ware, Pnited States
Marshal of the same district, both with
headauarter? at San Antonio, arrived here
yesterday and are at the Grand. Mr. Cdl
bertson is the son of Congressman D. B.
Cuibertson and brother of Governor C.
A. Cuibertson of Texas. Tbe gentlemen
brought up a Chinese for deportation.
Colonel Ware, wbo for three years past
has been United States Marshal, reigns
j over the largest district in the United
I States. It reaches clear to the Rio Grande
and includes the valleys of the Pecos,
Brazos and other rivers. It also takes in
the famous Staked Plains of Texas. It is
largely in this region that the Texas
rangers are employed for tbe protection of
frontier settlers against desperate out
laws.
"That part of Texas is now pretty
quiet," said Marsnal Ware iast night.
"We don't have the trouble that we used
to have. The country has changed a good
deal. Ido not have anything to do with
the Texas Rangers, as they are not under
Federal, but State authority. I think
there are only two or three companies of
them now, with about fifteen men in each
company.
"How'will Texas go politically? It will
be for silver. There Is no doubt about
that. Yes, we have some gold Democrats
tb*Â»re."
Marshal Ware was for twelve years a
Sheriff in Texas. He had many thrilling
experiencei in the earlier days of Texas,
; and is one of the best-known officials in
i tbe Lone Star State.
He and Mr. Cuibertson will be heiÂ« for
several days. It is their first trip to
California.

Five of the Cups Which Are Offered This Year by the Horse Show Association of the Pacific Coast.
WANT IDLE CM
TRACKS TORN UP,
Wheelmen Discuss Radical
Ways to Improve
the City.
NEW LEAGUE'S PLANS.
Nominees Must Declare For
Reforms to Get the Cyclers'
Votes.
WHEELS MUST GO AS BAGGAGE
Good Pavements and General Good
Government to Be Aimed for by
the Riders.
The recently formed Wheelmen's Munic- '
Ipal League met last night at the head
quarters of the San Francisco Road Club,
503 Golden Gate avenue, and took steps cal- |
culated ultimately to make the power of
the cyclers felt as a great political force in
this City. All the large cycling clubs of
San Francisco were represented.
Tne league will work as a strictly non
partisan organization, bent on securing
not only smooth pavements and impartial
legislation, but good government in all the
branches of municipal business.
That article in the constitution provid
ing for an executive committee of nine
members to transact executive business
was stricken out by a vote of the meeting.
J. S. Conwall, chairman of the execu
tive committee, presented a report em
bodying the following recommendations:
Firstâ That the Wheelmen's Municipal
League indorse only such nominees for the
State Senate and Assembly as will pledge
themselves to support a bill declaring the
bicycle to be baggage.
Secondâ Tbat the committee be empowered to
invite each nominee in the Assembly and Sen- .
atorial districts of the City and County of San
Francisco to appear before the executive com
mittee of the Wheelmen's Municipal League
and express himself as to the Armstrong bill
and all other measures of interest to wheel
men.
Thirdâ That the Wheelmen's Municipal
Loegue endeavor to secure the nomination
and election of such municipal officers as will
be of benefit to wheelmen.
Fourthâ That the executive committee be
empowered to nominate officers, such nomi
nations to be subject to the confirmation of
the association, and that it be the object of
the league to secure the indorsement of these
nominees by the nominating conventions,
such nominations to be consistent with the
decision of the Supreme Court in the case
now pending.
When the report was taken up for dis
cussion only the first clause, that in regard
to legislation declaring the bicycle to be
baggage, was adopted, and the other mat
ters were reserved for future consideration.
W. L. Maule, chairman of the committee
on additional membership and credentials,
advised as to the methods to be pursued
in enlisting the co-operation of the many
hundreds of cyclers not attached to any of
the clubs. The report as a whole was
adoDted.
T. B. McGinnis for the "finance and aud
iting committee submitted a report rec
ommending that the league work for the
passage of the Armstrong bill declaring
bicycles baggage; appeal to political
parties and not to individual candi
dates; to secure pledges from po
litical parties to have new, smooth
pavements laid wher > old basalt and cob
ble pavements are now being repaired at
considerable expense; to strive to have all
street railway franchises forfeited where
the tracks are not used and to have the
tracks removed and such streets put in re
pair; to demand an immediate change in
the plans and specifications of street work
as now performed; to strive to have the
park lighted by electricity, perhaps em
ploying, and at small expense, the power
ful machinery already in use for pumping
jmrposes during tne daytime; and to show
tiie puolic that the league is working not
only for good streets, but for good govern
ment generally.
It was also suggested that inasmuch as
San Francisco is already well covered with
streetcar lines, all streets not now covered
by a franchise be forever preserved from
the introduction of tracks and be main
tained as smooth driveways.
The management of the Mechanics'
Institute Fair sent word that Friday,
September 4, has been set aside as bicycle
night. Chairmau Frank H. Kerrigan
accordingly appointed the following com
mittee to take charge of the programme
lor that evening: H. F. Wynne, J. W.
McGuire and W. B. Faucett.
Among the reasons assigned by the
officials of the Southern Pacific for im
posing a tariff on bicycles crossing the
terries and to near-by points is that they
are subjected to frequent and annoyinely
small demands for damages to bicycles
injured in transit, and the idea of charg
ing for the transportation of wheels is to
indemnify the company for these claims.
When this excuse of the monopoly was
brought to the attention of a gentleman
who has been in the habit of frequently
using Huntington's trains to return from
bicycle trips he expressed surprise that
such a flimsy and peculiar excuse should
be put forward to justify what he terms a
bit of petty and absolutely unjustifiable
imposition.
"Few wheelmen who take a train back
from a point like San Jose," he said, "care
about twenty-five cents additional ex
pense, but they will resist this tax to tne
utmost of their power, not for the saving
they expect to effect, but owing to the
gross imposition that they consider this
proposed charue to be. Personally, I con
sider this departure of the Southern
Pacific Company a very impolitic one and
one that will occasion a loss of revenue
instead of ah increase. It will also add to
tha unpopular sentiment existing in
reference to this corporation. They would
have done much better, both pecuniarily
and politically, had they, instead of im
posing additional annoyance on wheel
men, arranged their baggage-cars so that
wheels would be properly cared for durine
transportation. As they run things now,
the wheels are tumbled into the baggage
car just as if they were bales and boxes of
freight, and no wheel that is once
entrusted to the mercy of a Southern
Pacific baggagemaster ever comes back to
its owner without being scarred and
scratched, if not actually damaged.
"If they would only provide racks or
hooks so that bicycles could be safely
stored in a car, few, if any, would demur
to paying a small additional fee for the
carriage of wheels, but they could well
afford to provide such accommodations
and not change a cent for the transporta
tion of bicycles, for such a move would
so popularize the" road that the increased
patronage would soon more than recoup
the small expense entailed, and every one
who rides a wheel would call them blessed
instead of cursing them, as is now the case.
"But the most outrageous thing in this
new move is to charge for carrying wheels
across the ferries and to ths terminals of
the local trains to Oakland, Alameda and
Berkeley. This entails no extra expense
on the company, nor does it impose any
additional labor on the employes con
nected with the ferry or train service.
Whoever has had occasion to bring his bi
cycle from one side of the bay to the other
knows that he carries tufl machine aboard
the ferry steamer and leaves it wherever
he can find a convenient place, and that
he has to load it into ahd unload it from
the bangage-car without even the proffer
of iiid from conductor, bnikenian or bag
gageman, though one or the other may be
looking on and grinning with gratification
over the awkward efforts of the inexpe
rienced wheelman to perform the duty
that properly belongs to a trainman.
"General Hubbard, when he was out
here, expressed surprise at the unpopu
larity of the Southern Pacific Company in
this State. This latest development would
be an object lesson that would open his
eyes on the subject. Here is an instance
where everything was being done to in
commode and annoy patrons of the road
who use a wheel, and when complaint is
made, instead of seeking to remedy the
evils complained of, the sore is made to
smart the more by a new imposition and
a new source of aggravation.
:I So far as lam personally concerned,
their action will prove a source of loss to
them. We are usually a Darty of seven or
eight on a Sunday, and we generally bring
up at San Jose. Hereafter instead of re
turning by the Southern Pacific train to
San Francisco, we will ride to Alviso, and
there take the boat to the City, and we
shall give our patronage, as far as possible,
to the roads which" operate in Marin
County. The roads there are good and
the railroads are accommodating."
GRAND ARMY CAMPERS,
The Pacific Coast Veterans De
parted for St. Paul Last
Evening.
San Francisco Msy Have the Old
Soldiers in 1898â Past Hospitality
Not Forgotten.
Representatives from the Department of
California to tbe Thirtieth National En
campment, Grand Army of the Republic,
which will be held this year at St. Paul,
Minn., took their departure last evening
on the 7 o'clock train by way of Portland.
The party consisted of Department Com
mander T. C. Masteller, Comrades T. K.
Stateler, John P. Roberts of San Fran
cisco ;J.N. Guinn, A. H. Johnson, Ed
ward W. Clark and wife, Los Angeles;
Commander Turn bull, Atkinson and
Smith of Oakland ; H. H. Richmond of
Auburn ; D. H. Coats and wife of Camp
bells, and J. D. Barnett of Santa Rosa.
At Portland the California representa
tives will be joined by the commander of
the Department of Oregon, his staff and
others; at Spokane by those from the
department of Washington, and at Hope
by the delegation from Idaho. The Mon
tana representatives will augment the
Pacific Coast delegation at Butte, the
whole forming an unusually large body
of representative veterans.
The encampment will open on Monday
next and continue until Friday, Septem
ber 4. The headquarters of the Pacific
Coast veterans will be in Stee's block.
Some time '&co the posts in Southern
California determined to appeal to the
National Encampment (his year to
authorize a division of two departments
in this State. This feeling has been over
come, and the project of the Southern
California veterans has been aabndoned.
There will be a strong contest for su
premacy between the East and West for
commander- in - chief. Comrade T. S.
Clarkson of Nebraska is tbe only candi
date of prominence from the West, while
Eastern comrades will put forward Com
rades D. R. Ballou of Rhode Island and
John R. Lineiian of Connecticut. An
other candidate may be Rear- Admiral
Richard W. Meade, U. S. N., retired, who
is being strongly advocated by Lafayette
Post No. 140 oi New York City.
Another important matter to be decided
is the question where the encampment for
next year will be held. Buffalo and Balti
more are roost prominent in the battle,
but no matter which place is selected*
there is a general desire on the part of
Eastern and Southern posts to hold the
encampment for 1898 in San Francisco
the generous hospitality of her people in
1886 being still in their minds.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 27, 1896.
PRIZE COPS FOR
THE HORSE SHOW
A .Number of New and
Beautiful Trophies Are
Donated.
ONE CUP IS JEWELED.
Inducements Are Now Offered
for Pacific Coast Bred
Horses.
AGENTS VISIT COUNTY FAIRS.
In Some Classes No Preference Will
Be Given to Horses With
Trimmed Tails.
The horse show, which opens on the
9th of next December, promises to be the
best which has yet been held on the Pa
: cific Coast. Every effort is being made to
I induce different classes of horse owners to
exhibit. Agents of the association have
toured the country, visiting farms and
ranches as far north as Puget Sound. The
county fairs are all being watched for ex
hibitors*, and as especial inducements are
offered this year to Pacitic-Coast-bred
horses, the probability is that there will
be a large increase in the number of ex
hibitors.
A number of cups are offered this year,
and it is expected tnat there will be more
before the date of the show. Five hand
some cuds, being made by Shreve, are just
about completed.
In the thoroughbred class the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club offers for the best two
year-old colt a silver-gilt cup, studded with
amethysts. A. B. Spreckels offers a silver
cup for the best performance of an ama
teur in driving a four-in-hand through 00
--: stacles. This cup was not offered last
year. Among the other cups, not offered
last year is the Robert F. Morrow chal
lenge cup for the best four-in-hand Pacific
Coast bred horses, to be shown before a
coach, break or wagonette, no preference
to be given to horses with docked or
trimmed tails. This cup must be won
two years in succession by the same ex
hibitor before becoming nis property, and
in the meantime it is to be held in trust
by the association.
In the trotting class the Shreve silver
cup is offered for the best stallion, four
years old or over. The Palace Hotel, in
class 17, donates a silver cup for the, best
pair ot driving horses. The foliowing
scale of points will govern in judging class
17: Each horse, 25 per centâ so per cent;
the pair, 20 per cent; wagon, 10 per cent;
harness, 5 per cent; robes, blanket and
whip, 5 per cent; general appointments,
taste, etc., 10 per cent; total, 100; speed
not essential.
The cups, the designs for which are not
yet accepted, include the John Bradbury
cup, new this year, for the best perform
ance of an amateur in driving a tandem
through obstacles; the California Jockey
Club cup for the best jumper, perform
ance over fences only to count; the George
A. Pope cup for the best pair of horses ex
ceeding 15 hands 1 inch, to be shown be
fore a brougham or victoria, norses to
count 50 per cent and the appointments 50
per cent.
The H. J. Crocker cup is offered for the
best polo pony, fourteen hands and under,
manners and handiness to be especially
considered. To secure this cup owners or
amateurs must ride. The Joseph D. Grant
cup is offered for the best team of two or
three-Fire Department horses, to be shown
to regular fire engines. This pup is to be
won two years in succession.
It is expected that the class for Pacific
Coast bred horses, which is new this year
will add considerably to the interest of
local owners. In this class no preference
will be given to horses with docked or
trimmed tails. Last year it was found
that owners of livery-stables were deterred
from exhibiting by the fear of having to
compete with wealthy owners, like Walter
S. Hobart. This year there is a livery
class, in which no preference is shown to
horses with docked or trimmed tails, as
livery-men complain that docking or
trimming a horse's tail interferes with its
sale.
It is expected that the class for horses
and delivery wagons will add a pictur
esque feature to the snow. The horses are
to be shown before an appropriate deliv
ery or express wagon, the horse to count
60 per cent and the wagon and appoint
ments 40 per cent.
In the class for horses in harness the
rules have oeen changed in a way which
will obviate tne pos&ibilitv of one horse
sweeping the whole thing."

private boxes for the coming show are:

SHERLOCK CARELESS.
Censured by a Coroner's Jury for the
Deaths of Netchen and
Murphy.
Richard Sherlock, nurse at the City
and County Hospital, was formally
charged yesterday by a Coroner's jury
with criminal negligence m the cases of
David Netchen and Thomas Murphy, who
were accidentally killed a few days ago by
being given a deadly poison instead of a
draught of medicine. The management
of the County Hospital was also severely
censured, and recommendations made
that certain rules be more rigidly enforced.
It will be remembered that on the after
noon of August 21 Sherlock left his ward
in the care of a patient with instruction to
give certain inmates their medicine at the
hours named on the card. During the
afternoon the . temporary nurse â¢â â¢
Netcher and Murphy a dose of wh
E resumed was the regular rueci
hortly after this the two men were i;
violently ill, Nechter dying that night
Murphy the following day. Prior to ilus,
however, it was ascertained that the men
had been given cocculus Indicus, a deadly
poison. After hearing the evidence in the
two cases the jury returned the following
verdict:
And we farther find that the said poison in
both cases was administered by one I.lr. Malla
bar without criminal interest, and we further
find that the nurse, Richard Sherlock, is guilty
of criminal carelessness and negligence in
leaving the ward before being relieved by a
professional nurse or some one equally com
petent. And we further find that certain rules
of the City and County Hospital are not
properly enforced.

PAUPERS MAY BE VOTERS
Election Commissioners Refused
Yesterday to Disfranchise
Them.
The Matter May be Tested in Court.
Labor Party Refused Reo
ognition.
The Board of Election Commissioners
decided yesterday not to interfere with
voting of the inmates of the Almshouse,
in spite of the protests of Attorney Ruef,
who said that he represented the Repub
lican party. This claim was not taken
very seriously by the Commissioners, in
view of the fact that T. J. L. Smiley has
been the recognized champion of the party
since the active preparations for the cam*
paign began.
Attorney Ruef said that it was the doty
of the Commissioners to strike off the
names because the constitution of the
State read thatno person should be deemed
to have gained or lost a residence by
reason of being an inmate of the Alms
house. Under that rule, he contended,
the paupers were not entitled to be regis
tered from the Almshouse precinct.
City and County Attorney Creswell
stated that he thought it was a matter for
the courts to decide and that in order to
give the petitioners for the measure a
chance to test it he would move that the
matter be left in its present state.
At this point Max Popper, who repre
sents the Democratic State Central Com
mittee, said he desired it to be understood
that the Democracy joined in the request.
He added that if the rule should be fol
lowed the RepuDlijcans would lose many
votes at Yountville.
"We don't taKe that view of it," said
Ruef.
"Well," said Creswell, "as long as this
matter has assumed a political aspect, I
will withdraw my motion."
The motion allowing the paupers to vote
was passed unanimously.
W. P. Grace, representing the Labor
party, appeared before tbe commission
and demanded that the party be given
representation on the election boards,
claiming that it was as much entitled to
recognition as the People's party.
The Commissioners took another view
of the matter, however, and after reading
the law to Sir. Grace and assuring him
that the votes cast by his party would be
fairly and impartially counted, refused to
grant his request.
The Registrar reported that he sent out
forty citations to persons who were sus
pected of having registered illegally, but
that only tnree had responded. As the
citations were on postal cards, there was
no evidence that they nad been served,
and the commission therefore decided not
to strike the names off the register, but to
send out second citations by special
delivery.
M'CALLUM AT REST.
Funeral or the Late Frot Officer of the
Steamer Gipsy.
The remains of Charles McCallum, first
officer of the steamer Gipsy, were laid to
rest yesterday afternoon in Odd Fellows'
Cemetery. Long before 2 o'clock, the
hour set for the funeral, Memorial Hall, in
which the services were conducted, was
filled with sorrowing friends of the de
ceased. The services were under the
auspices of Golden Gate Chapter No. 204,
I. 0. O. F.
Several hymns were sung by the
Knickerbocker quartet. The casket was
completely hidden beneath the many
floral offerings, the principal one being
an immense broken wheel sent by the
crew of the steamer Gipsy. The pall
bearers were selected from California Har
bor No. 15, A. A. of M , and from Golden
Gate Chapter No. 204.

UNION PAINTERS
WIN A VICTORY.
School 'Department Work
Will Be Done by Them
in Future.
DIRECTORS UNANIMOUS.
Tne Board of Education Rejects
Several Unsatisfactory
Jobs.
MR. MURDOCK'S RESOLUTION.
A Proposition to Curtail the Appoint
ment of Teachers V gorously
Opposed.
The union painters of this City won an
important victory when the report of the
Buildings and Grounds Committee of the
Board of Education was adopted at the
meeting last evening.
Some time ago Â»be painters sent a com
munication to the board stating that the
work that wan in progress on sixteen
buildings belonging to the department
was being done by non-union labor and in
a slovenly and entirely unsatisfactory
manner. They asked that the matter be
investigated, and that, if possible, it be
given union men.
The matter was referred to the Build
ings and Grounds Committee and that
body reported last evening. The report
stated that the grounds of the union men
were well taken, and tha* the work was
not being done in a satisfactory manner.
The recommendation was made that in
future all big contracts be given to firms
employing union men, the time of labor
being limited to eight hours per day.
Attached to the committee's report was
a communication from the architect of
the department stating that of the six
teen contracts let four had been rejected
and ordered done over because the work
was badly done, and that the twelve re
maining unfinished would be kept under
a close watch to see that the work was ac
cording to specifications. The report was
adopted unanimously.
The matter of teachers' appointments
was discussed by the board. Director
Murdock offered the following resolution:
Resolved, That In view of the curtailed ap
propriation no new classes be formed in either
day or evening schools, unless they can be
provided for by consolidation, and that no fur
ther appointments of teachers be made, ex
cepting to iUI vacancies occasioned by death
or resignation.
Directors Knox and Clinton opposed
any such measure vigorously, saying that
the department should not be allowed to
auffe in its progress because of a lack of
funds. If the schools must be closed be
fore the end of the school year let the
blame fall where it belonged, on the
shoulders of the Board of Supervisors.
"San Francisco," said Director Knox,
"is already behind the other great cities
of the country in its school facilities and
we must not allow the impression to go
abroad that we cannot properly educate
our children. We must have teachers for
branches that are demanded by the exi
gencies of modern education. If the
Supervisors choose to cut down our ap
propriation and cripple our Department
let them stand the brunt of the storm of
public wrath that will certainly fall upon
some one." It was decided to lay the mat
ter over for two weeks to allow some of
the directors to look more closely into the
question.
The Classification Committee reported
as follows:
That flve| classes have been consolidated In
the Lincoln Evening School, one class in the
Washington and one in the Lincoln Grammar
School : that the FranKiin Evening School now
contains five classes, the Fairmount Evening
School three classes, Mission Evening School
two classes; that one class has been trans
ferred from the Crocker Grammar School to
the Dudley Stone Primtiry Scnool; that a new
class has been formed in the Richmond
Primary School; that a new sixth grade class
has been opened in the Crock r Grammar
School; that on August 3 one cl 8? was con
solidated in the Irving Scott Primary- School ;
that one class was consolidated n the Emer
son Primary School.
The committee also recommended that Miss
K. H. Crowley be transferred from the prin
cipalship of the Richmond Evening School to
the same position in the Horace Mann Even
ing School ; that W. J. Gorman be transferred
to the Fairmount Evening School, Rosella La
Faille to the Frankiin Fvening School, Miss
Abbie Hurley to the Franklin Evening School;
that Miss Eliza L. West be assigned to the
evening substitute class; that Miss Lillie Mc-
Maho-.i be transferred to the Franklin Evening
School; that A. J. Hunston be as
signed to the Franklin Evening Schooi;
that Miss Sophie Athearn De trans
ferred to the Mission Evening School; that
Miss Mary Moran De transferred to the Dudley
Stone Primary School; that Miss Aimee Hirstel
be transferred to the Crocker Grammar School;
that Miss Mary C. McKinney be assigned to
the new class in the Richmond Primary
School.
The following transfers were also recom
mended: Miss I. R. Brown to Hamilton
Grammar School, Miss J. N. Sykes to the
James Lick Grammar, Miss Margaret A. Bur
nett to the Lincoln Grammar School.
It was recommended that the high school
class in the Horace Mann Evening School be
discontinued and that the teacher, George
Bates, be transferred to the Franklin Evening
School; thnt the high scnool class in the Wash
ington Evening School be discontinued nnd
the teacher. Miss Jennie Powers, be trans
ferred to the Lincoln Evening School to in
struct the class of Miss M. H. Jones during her
absence; that the high school classes in the
Horace Mann Grammar School building be
permitted to use tbe "Francais Pratique" by
Paul Bercy as a text book, and that Mrs. Mary
M. Fitzgerald of the day substitute class be as
signed to the San Francisco Normal School as
assistant teacher at a salary of $83 per month.
On Director Barrett's motion Miss Mary
Murphy was transferred from the Jeffer
son Primary School to the principalship
of Le Conte Primary School and Miss
Pauline Hart from the Kincon Grammar
School to the principalship of the Jeffer
son Primary School. Miss M. J. Wolf was
elected a regular teacher of the depart
ment.
PAINTERS STILL ALIVE.
Journeymen Will Hold a Mass-
Meeting Saturday Evening.
The union painters did not hear of their
victory before their meeting adjourned
last evening. The schoolhouse question
was brought up, and it was decided to
send a communication to the Building
Trades' Council requesting that body to
ask the Board of Education to make an
examination of all the schoolhouses. The
union offers to send a committee with the
board to show where slopwork has been
done on nearly every schoolhouse.
It was decided to hold a special mass
meeting on Saturday evening to show the
boss painters that the union is still alive
and will contest every attempt to cut
wages, whicd, it is rumored, the bosses
have threatened to do. Good speakers
will address the meeting, and a general
entertainment is being prepared. The
meeting will be held at 115 Turk street.
Last evening the union issued its first
manifesto to the public. In the letter
which is addressed particularly to house
holders, it says:
The large lvolders of property are deceived
through architects and certain agents who
have control of all repairing and renovations.
They generally have a certain party do their
work; for this the painter boss must give up
part profit to the agent, and to make up the
difference, he uses inferior material or puts on
one coat less than is called for. â¢ * The
above does not apply to all master painters,
agents or architects, for some men in these
branches are endeavoring to act justly.
The following are the ingredients of paints
used by many men calling themselves master
painters: They are lye, water, whitening,
putty, coal oil, fish oil and a great deal of ben
zine, or what is called 'â¢66," or "French turn*.,"
by some, so as not to give the fraud away. You
should see that the number of coats oi paint
are put on as called for in specifications, which

It was a special meeting called for the
purpose of acting on this matter, and was
fully attended.
Mr. Curtis' resignation is to go into

The temporary injunction granted Edwin T.
Earl against the Southern Pacific and Rooert
Graham, in the matter of a patent refrigerator
car, was dissolved by Judge McKenna yester
day, pending a review of the case by the Court
of Appeals. In the meantime the defendant*

Deserted His Wife.
Emma McMullen began suit in divorce yes

EAILROAD INFLUENCE FELT.
Monteith, McGlashan, Rogers, Magnire
acd Barlow to Be TnrneJ Down
in the N;w Deal.
The Populist leaders are finding i: a
t rather difficult matter to deliver the goods
of their party to their Democratic masters.
Monteith in the First Congressional Dis
trict and McGlashan in the Second are
around town chewing lather and swearing
. in a double sense that they will net re
sign. On the Democratic side is Joseph
Kelly of the Fifth, *no was turned down
t*o years aeo. Mr. Kelly vows that he
will no: tender his resignation to the
triple-heaced sliver plated Bourbon hay
seed junta which is now engaged in mak
ing a slate for Congressmen. ,
That the Populists of this State have
fc*ea bunkoed by the Democracy eithsr
with or without the consent of their
leaders is apparent. For instance, the
plan of action adopted last Tuesday pro
vides that no action taken by the joint
committee shall be valid umess approved
of by two-thiras of the members of each
committee voting for Buch action. This
will require ten votes of the committee of
fifteen to nominate a man for Congress.
Such nominations must be approved of by
the State Executive Committees of the
Democratic or People's Party, but two
thirds of any one committee may object
to the nomination of any .particular man,
and their objection would be sufficient to
keep him oS the ticket.
la other words, twojmen on the silver
committee may prevent the nomination of
any man whom they do not like.
The silver portion of t,he joint committee
on conference- was called into existence by
I George W. Baker, chairman of the Bime
tallic League. Mr. Baker U said to
have bad considerable business from the
bcuthern Pacific Company. He some time
azo issued a circular calling for the nomi
nation of a silver comriiitteemau from
each Senatorial district in the State. "; In
response to this call four or five interested
persons got together in each district,
named their committee man, fixed up bis
credentials and sent the proxy to Baker,
who is, strictly speaking, the whole of the
Silver party.
The Populists cannot nominate a man
without the consent of their executive
committee, but they can reject a candi
date eren .without consulting with their
* executive committee.
Colonel Taylor Rogers, People' 3 party
candidate in the Fifth, has resigned, in
obedience to the plan of action, and the
understanding is that he is to b ? turned
down and that James H. Barry, a Dem
ocrat, will get his place. Colonel Rogers
talked a good deal about the "American"
type of face while he was attending the
National Populist Convention in Su Louis,
and it is believed that four Democrats,
constituting two-thirds of the six on the
committee, will refuse to accept him.
Should|thij be done, their action, being in
accordance with the plan adopted, would
be final ana without appeal.
In the matter of George W. Monteith's
candidacy lor Congress in the First Dis
trict, it is understood that Humboldt
County is one of that gentleman's strong
holds, and the Southern Pacific Company,
through its agents, has circulated ail kinds
of stories calculated to excite popular sen
timent against him. and as a further in
ducement to head him off, they have
offered to allow Humboldt County to
name the Congressional fusion candidate
' from the First District. . ,
It was proposed, in the first place, that
in case Monieith refused to commit po
litical suicide, he should be .assassinated
by the Democratic convention placing in
nomination Judge S. M. Buck of Hum
boidt, a strontr Populist., By doing tu^s
they would place Monteith. in the position
of standing in the way of the election of
another Populist.
But this programme was upset by Judze
Back himself. The Judge saw through
the game and refused to be made a cat's
paw of. The next thing on- the slate was
to nominate a Humboidt Democrat witn
Populistic leanings, and the leaders â of
the . Democratic combine picked out a
callow youtu named Cutler, a boy orator
ana partner of Judge Back. Then they
brought influences to bear upon leading
Populists in Hnmboldt County to have
them induce Monteith to resign, but he
has resisted alike their cajoleries and their
threats.
This will put a Democrat on the sJate in
the First District whether Monteith should
resign or not.. . . .
In the Second District the programme is
to turn down McGlasban and let De Tries,
a Democrat, stand as the fusion candidate.
In tne Third District, M. F. Tarpey or
William D. English will be made the fU3^
lienI icn candidate. Both are Democrats.
in the Fourth District'tbe programme is
said to be to scratch Mazuire to please the
Southern Pacific and to put \ up another
Democrat in his place. By the plan of ac
tion Maguire is pledged to support all the
fusion candidates, and he cannot protest
without breaking his pledge. Maguire,
however, is pretty solid with the manipu
lators of his party.
I In the Fifth District Taylor Rogers will
be turned down and Barry, a Democrat,
will be put up in his stead.
C. A. Barlow, the People's Party candi
date in the Sixth, refused at first to hand
in his resignation, as he suspected foul
play, but the managers promised that they
would put nim-oacc and he consented to
resign. As two of the Silver delegates or
four of the Democratic delegate* can pre
vent his being renominated merely with a
protest,,the chances are that he may re
ceive,- not Mr. Bryan's cross of ' cold, but
I the double cross known to sporting men.'
Castle (Populist) will be allowed to
stand in the Seventh. The Democrats
have no hope of carrying that district and j
theywill present it to Mr. Castle on a free
sliver salver.
As the date now stands the fusion will
look something like this:
First Districtâ A Democrat.
Second District â A Democrat.
Third Di-trictâ A Democrat.
luorth District â A Democrat.
Fifth District â A Democrat.
Sixth District â A Democrat.
Seventh Districtâ A Popalut.
This is the silver brick which the Democ
racy is asking the Populists to purchase.

The Merced Sun, after complimenting
John S. Dore, says:
In the National Convention at St. Lcralj the
Populists were betrayed by- their leaders and
an attempt was cade to sell ont the party.
Some of tne leaders in this State are now try
ing to complete tbe joo, but we hope that a
majority of the State Central Committee will
repudiate this action at tneir next meeting
and cut loose from the Democratic hypnotic
influences which have been thrown about
them. The Popu-ists ol this State will not cast
half a vote lor Sewali under asv cirenm
stances, and if this damnabie deal is ratified
by the State Central Committre it will make
Bryan's defeat in mis State absolutely certain.
Honorable defeat at the polls will be" far more
preferable to honest Populists than any vic
tory that could result from such a compromise
as the committees have agreed upon.
Mr. Dore is certainly the right man in the
right place.

the following is an extract: .
; We believe that, though ridiculous as our
present position may at first blush appear, aa
a political party we hare a decided advantage
of oar suopo-ea ally, the Democracy. â ' At best
we could only nope to carry on a campaign of
education, which we can do fally as well with
Mr. Sewali in the field as out. With the ad
vantage -of being the second party, with toe
gallant Tom Watson represenJinz Populism,
while Sewall would represent Democracy, we
are sure ~ to be, why should we ask to have
wall withdrawn? You may say, to insure
the election of Bryan. '- ; . ..
. Why should we as Populists . make any
further sacrifices, or even effort, to secure his
election, if his own party does not show any
disposition to meet us a small fraction of the
way in our effort to secure su. h election? '
Let Populists quit 'worrvinKj about '.what
Democracy will or will not do, but let them
rather get down to business and make the best
of the situation, roll up as many million votes
for Bryan and ' Watson as they can, never
neglecting an opportunity to convert tee hosts
of Democrats, who are "coming our way," to
the principles of Populism. This is the proper
course, as we see it. We do not object to
Brvan's election, and are witting to assist the
Democrats in its consummation, but propose
to wait /or them to "get in the notion". before
giving the matter serious consideration. When
they do this, they will be ready and trilling to
indorse electors favorable tto . Mr. Watson's
election, whether Bewail withdraws or not

THE GOLDEN STATE
NATIVE DAUGHTERS
Mutual Improvement and
Benefit the Order's
Object.
ITS GRAND OFFICERS.
First Parlor Instituted in Ama
dor County in September, 1886,
by Mrs. T. L. Kane.
MRS. MART E. TILLMAN
Grand President, Wi;h Sixty-five
Parlors and 2500 Members Under
Her Jarisdiction.
The order of the Native Daughters of
the Golden West is among the most pow
erful women's organizations on the Pacific
Coast.
Tne first parlor was organized in Jack
sou, Amador Coanty, in September, 18S6,
'UVtVWZ-Ti-uvi*..
by Mrs. Tina L. Kane and Mrs. Lillia
Rich! ing. It was called Ursula Parlor No.
1, and is still in existence.
The association is not simply an organi
zation for benehciary purposes. Its aims
and objects are much broader ana higher
and in the constitution this is clearly set
forth as follows:
The objects of the parlors of the Native
Daughters of the Golden West "are social
intercourse, mental improvement and
mutual benefit; the uniform administra
tion of tbe rights, privileges and benefits
of thÂ« order of the N. D. G. W.; perpet
uating tbe memory of the founders of tbe
State of California; the increase and dif
fusion of knowledge among its members;
the improvement of the condition of its
membership, socially and materially, by
encouragement when in need, and pro
viding for and comforting the sick and
distressed member* of the order,"
The officers and members of this power
ful and influential organization are among
tbe best representative women in the
State, and every day the order grows in
numbers and importance. New parlors
are constantly being establisned and the
oider ones increasing in membership.
At the present time tbe order numbers
over sixty-five parlors and has some 2500
members.
In September. ISBy, the board of relief of
the Native Daughters was incorporated
under the laws of California.
The object of tbe relief fund is to aid and
assist any of tne Daughters who may be
ill or in distress and whose parlors have
assisted them to the full extent of their
power and can now do no more.
80 far there have been few, very few,
call-* made upon tbisfund.
Tbe fund itself was created first by a
bequest from the late S. P. Rodgers and it
has since been increased and sustained by
an annual contribution of three dollars
from each ot the various parlors.
Last year in sick benefits, etc., the
Native Daughters paid oat over three
thousand douars.
In her address at Grass Valley, Miss E.
A. Spenser, the former Grand President,
said tbe aim of the Native Daughters is
not merely pleasure and social enjoyment;
their real purpose is to lead the Daughters
of California to the highest sphere of true
womanhopod and to bind together in the
bends of â¢common affection the children
cf this glorious State.
And it is also their desire to honor and
perpetual â¢ the memories of the pioneers
aDd founders of the State of their birth.
Admission day is the day of ail others
specially honored by tbe Native Daughters
as it is the birthday of California, the an
niversary cf the day when she received
legal status as a full member among the
sister States of tbe Union.
The 15; hoi May is dedicated by the
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
order to tbe memory of departed members,
being their memorial day. This pretty,
tender custom might weil bÂ« imitated by
other associations, and some appropriate
memorial ceremonies be given then.
A healthy rivalry exists among the
various parlors, and each strives to do the
best work and make tne most prosperous
snowing.
Miss Mariana Bertola, the grand presi
dent, ia a resident of Martinez, where she
holds a foremost place among the most
prominent women of tnat town. She is a
young woman endowed with fine educa
tional acquirements and is principal of the
Martinez schooL She is a member of Ra
mona Parlor No. 21.
Mrs. Georgie Ryan is the grand secre
tary and is a very able and efficient officer.
Her omce is in the Merchants' Exchange
and ail the business of the order of the
Native Daughters is conducted there. Mrs.
Ryan is a member ol Buena Vista, Parlor
No. 68.
Mrs. mge Petersen Faure is tbe grand
treasurer and performs the arduous duties
of her position with ability and conscien
tiousness. She is an active member of
Alta Parlor No. 3.
Mrs. Mary TUlman, the grand president,
is a thoroughly experienced and able
officer, who has been long acquainted with
the work of the order. Minerva Parlor
No. 2 claims her as a member.
Besides these officers then are live grand
trustees, who assist in carrying on the
business of tbe order.
The qualification for membership in
the Native Daughters of the Golden ' West
is limited to white women born within the
State of California, and the candidate
must be of good moral character and at
least 13 years of age. The intending
member must also be recommended by
two members in good standing in the par
lor she proposes to enter.
Few orders have made the wonderful
progre?s in the comparatively short time
they have been organized the Native
Daughters ha* done. Its social, moral
and financial standing in the community
is all that cooli be desired, ana few other
associations are either bo prosperous or so
popular as this organization.
The order is in fine, strong, working !
condition, and presents a united and har- i
monious aDpearance that does credit to
the sex.
Such associations elevate and broaden
the women who belong to them, and the
practical working of a well-conducted or

RIGHT OF FREE SPEECH,
Light Sentence Passed Upon
William Costley, the
Socialist.
His Attorney Gives Notice of Appeal,
and the Other Cases Continued
for Tairty Days.
William Costley, tbe socialist, wfio was
convicted by a jury in Judge Conlan's
court on Tuesday on the charge of
disturbing the peace at Seventh and
Market streets on Saturday night, August
15, appeared for sentence yesterday.
Attorney Guiifoyle, on behalf of the de
fendant, moved lor a new trial and arrest
of judgment on the usual statutory
grounds. He contended that the defend
ant never entered a plea to the complaint;
the complaint was not read to the jury,
and it had not been shown by the evidence
that a public offense had been committed.
The defendants were simply exercising
their right under the constitution to
peacefully assemble and discuss their
grievances.
Attorney J. J. Ccffey replied, and Justice
I of the Peace Carroll, who presided in the
i court during Judge Conlan's absence,
! overruiea the motion for a new trial and
i arrest oi judgment. He showed by the
j records that a plea of not guilty had been
j entered by the defendant whea a jury was
I demanded.
Beuben H. Lloyd said on behalf of the
1 Odd Fellows' Association that he had no
! desire for a heavy penalty being inflicted.
I His clients did not oppose free speech,
but tbev esked that the socialists should
1 keep away from that corner and not inter-
I fere with people's business. There were
j plenty of places in tbe City where they
i could assemble without interfering with
â¢ the business of storeteepers.
Justice Carroll then lined the defendant
I $5 or twenty-four hours in the County
I Jail. Attorney Guiifoyle gave notice of
: appeal, and tbe defendant was released on
' his own recognizance until the appeal
'â  papers could be tiled.
The cases against the other seven de
â  fendants were continued for thirty <layÂ«.

THE WAY TO VOTE
FOR THE WOMEN,
Letter of Explanation From
the Secretary of
State.
CONFUSION AVERTED.
Mode of Printing the Ballots
Will Leave No Rocm
lor Error.
SONGS OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
New Lyrical Leaflet for Use at Politi
cal Meetings Daring the Com*
isg Campaign.
Considerable apprehension has been
shown by friends of the woman suffrage
cause owing to the fear that voters would
not know how to cast their ballots for or
against the proposed suffrage- amend
ment to tbe State constitution.
It was said that the numbers of the six
proposed amendments would be printed
on the ballots without any words of ex
planation as to the matters which the
several amendments would cover.
Still more confnsion was occasioned by
the fact that when tbe proposed woman
suffrage amendment was introduced into
the Legislature it was known as "Assem
bly bill 1L" From this name the
transition to "Amendment XI" was easy
and natural.
Voters in the interior, bearing that there
were only six proposed amendments to be
voted on, were completely at sea regard
ing the "eleventh amendment," on which
the hope of woman suffrage depends.
Letters commenced pouring into the
Woman Suffrage Bureau from all parts of
the State, the tale of each correspondent
being "I want to vote for woman suffrage,
but 1 don't know how." Miss Mary E.
Hay, the State organizer and chairman of
the State Central Woman Suffrage Com
mittee, commenced to realize that iife was
becoming a burden. Her desk began
to look like the floor of an editorial room,
her normally sunny nature was frequently
overshadoywed fey glowering clouds, while
her eyes grew little by little to resemb c
those of a hunted gazelle hard pressed by
the hounds.
Things had reached this alarming stage
when fair weather was restored by the ar
rival at the Woman Suffrage Bureau of
the following letter:

Madam: The amendments in all probability
will be printed on the ballot in the order in
which they appear in the Governor's procla
mation. Over each amendment will be an ex
planation stating : the object and purpose of
the amendment in brief language. ',. ' -
L. H. Beows, Secretary of State.
"This sets us to rights." said Miss Hay
yesterday, in a blither tone than she has
employed for some days past. "The Sec
retary o: State assures us that each amend
ment wiil be clearly and unmistakably
distinguished from the others on the bal
lots, and no one need now fear that he
will vote on the wrong side without know
ing it. As for myself, the news comes to
me lite a sweet, restful breeze f.om the
Eiysian fields. Hundreds upon hundreds
of letters have been sent me, which to
morrow's issue of ThÂ« Call will answer.
I will order a ton or so of the papers and
have them sent to the good people who
have asked for information on this impor
tant matter."
The bureau has just gotten out a leaflet
on which are eight stirring woman suf
frage epics arranged to tbe melodies of
well-known popular and patriotic airs.
Though it is difficult to select the best
among compositions of apparently equal
merit, the following will serve as a sample :

Is usually accomoanled by fair weather: "low"

"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In the Interior
and low alone; the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;'
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of

the pressure falling to the California coast, warmei
weather may be expected in summer and colder

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
. NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 26.â The announce
ment of the failure of Hilton, Hughes A Co. had
only a passing effect upon the markets for securi
ties at the opening. There was a disposition to
hammer the list at thai time, but the decline . was
only fractional and was soon checked by a further
reduction In the rates of sterling . and cable ad
vices from London that Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and
other. banking houses intended to import addi
tional amounts of gold on the steamers sailing
from the other side this week. The first decline
was equal to V B @yÃ P er cent, but before 10:40
a. m: most of the loss had been recovered. Still
later there was another downward turn, the ex
treme apathy shown by the bulls inviting another
- attack. At the lowest point Illinois Steel showed
a tit-cine of 5 points, Baltimore and Ohio 2*/4,
Minnesota Iron 2, Bay State Gas 3V 2 and the gen
eral Hit Vi@' 8 /* percent. . â 
The heaviness of Baltimore and Ohio was at
tributed to rerorts that Expert Little's statement
01 tne flairs of the company will make a veiy un
favorable showing, but as far as known nothing
new has developed concerning the property. There '
was almost an entire absence of outside orders ana
the movements were sluggish, throughout. Near
the clime there was a little more pressure to se.l in
consequence of an advance in the rate for call
loans to 10 per cent. ' .
The market left off dull and steady In tone- net
changes show losses of 14 to % per cent, .Burling
ton and Quinry lending. .Manhattan rose i /g and
Northwest % per cent. In the inactive list Illinois
.steel fell 5, Minnesota Iron 2 ana Baltimore and
Ohio 2. Total sales were 102,464 shares. including
24,700 shares sugar, 15,600 Western Union . and '

.' IHIUAUO MABKETS.
CHICAG r, 111., Aug. 26.â There was consider
able selling zeal exhibited by. holders of Septem
ber wheat this morning, and the anxiety evinced
had its effect on the other months, causing them
to falter and break in sympathy with the near-by
delivery, Fine weather. Indifferent cables and
good Northwestern receipts (436- cars, against 346
last Wednesday and 677 a year ago) all tended to
infuse an easy tone. For a few moments immedi
ately subsequent to the .opening comparative
steadiness prevailed, but the evident Improbability
that an advance- would ocour soon influenced
longs, and Increased auantitles of . wheat came on
the market. Receipts at Chicago were 87 cars,
and 291,693 bushels were withdrawn from store.
Export clearances were immense, 891,109 bushels
(including wheat and flour) going out. After
they were posted the market was a little firmer in
tone, but those who bought, finding a slight profit
in sight, proceeded to secure it, and in so doing |
caused another decline. Closing Paris cables were |
from 20 to 46 centimes lower for flour, and 15 to
30 lower for wheat. Antwerp was unchanged,
and Berlin 14 mark lower, to % marie higher.
December wheat opened from 6oyg@6Oy4C, de
clined to 69 % c, closing at ,5984@b9%c i,4@s/ 8 c
under yesteruay. Estimated receipts for to
morrow. 150. cars.
CORNâ Elected to decline because of the weak
ness in wheat. That was all there was to the mar
ket for this grain; no news calculated to cause In
terest being received, and business still continu
ing in the stagnant condition so familiar of late.
Receipts were 317 cars, and 119,790 bushels were
withdrawn from store. Liverpool cables were Vid
lower, . .Export clearances were liberal at 757,1bv:
bushels. May corn opened at 25%@26c, sold be
tween 'i6(di'26\ac and 953,4 c, cloning at the inside,
14c under yesterday. Es.imated receipts for to
morrow, 600 cars.
O^Tsâ a steadier feeling than was noted in the
other markets existed in oats- An undertone of
confidence and strength asserted itself in this mar
ket aud prevented too tree an exhibition of sym
pathy with wheat and corn. Receipts were 217
cars, and 76,500 bushels were withdrawn from
store. May oats closed a . shade over yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 300 cars.

THE STOCK MARKET.
The leading Comstocks were a trifle higher yes
terday with the usual light sales. The close was
firm.
The Con. Imperial assessment falls delinquent
in office to-day and the Besi & Belcher delinquent
sale takes place also.
The Stockton Electric Railroad Company has
levied an assessment Of (6 per share, delinquent
September 23.
The Anglo-California Bank will pay a semi-an
nual dividend next mouth.
The semi-annual dividend of the London, Paris
and American Bank will be paid next month.
In the Bolwer Consolidated on the 200 level
stopes 9 and 10 above crosscut 2 south still furnish
the bulk of the ore and the grade is about the
same. On the tunnel level raise 1 from stope 6
shows ore which Is narrow, but of good grade. In
raise 2 trom stope 9 the ore Is very small and
poor, but they will continue to prospect the
grouud. The intermediate drift from the raise
was advanced six feet through barren quartz and
clay, improving to ore of better grade. Extracted
during the weeK 13.6 tons of ore assaying from
$18 to $160 per ton; true average, $38.
In the Bodie Consolidated for the week ending
August 22, on the 200-foot level In the Gildea
ledge, the raise was advanced 11 feet through old
fillings and 4 feet is in new ground showing 8
Inches of ore, sampling a Ik tie over f 120 per ton.
This is a 1 illar left by old workings, and its size
cannot be determined. The north drift No. 2 from
the long east crosscut was advanced 2 feet and dis
continued. On the 300-foot level, 150 feet of drift
and crosscut leading to the Burgess ledge have
been retracked, preparatory to pushing the south
drift further, and 4Vfe tons of $20 to $25 rock,
found in the breast ot this, have been run out to
the shaft and hoisted. On the 350-foot level, 26
tons o^, fillings from the Fortuna vein, south and
west of the shaft, have been taken out. On the
400-foot level in the Fortuna velu 8 tons of fillings
have been extracted, which ere of rather low
grade. The Mono drift has been run north on th c
Fortuna from the east crosscut, showing hard
quartz and porphyry in the face. On the 660-foot
level, work on the Fortuna vein near the Standard
line has been discontinued temporarily, pending
better facilities for working. On the surface they
are cleaning out around the ore chutes and under
the pans in the mill, and are running the material
in the pans at the Standard mill.
'1 he Mayflower gravel mine in Placer County,
which has been leased totrUuters, is now being
run by the comp ny. Recently pay gravel wa-i
struck in what Is known as the West Orono
channel, which crosses the main Mayflower chan
nel at right angeles. This pay gravel is 3V2 to 4
feet thick, and a recent eruthlng of 400 carloads
gave an average of Â»'J 90 to the car. of which
about $1 75 per car is clear profit to the company.
Yesterday the fltst bullion shipment from this
gravel, valued at $2000, was received. The mine,
after paying a total of $lÂ«;,000 in dividends, or
about $2 80 per >hur â  on the 60,000 shares of
capital sto'-K. reached a period of adversity in
December, i 895, when the last dlviden.l of 10
cents per share was paid. The main channel fro >
which the pay gravel was taken was regarded as
we 1 worked out. The company, fortunately, had a
surplus of $2u,000 m its treasury, and was anle to
keep along until r>centiy, when all work on its
own account stopped, and the mine was leased to
tributers.

A aUESTION OF MERIT.
The Attorney, Who Is a Cripple,
Causes His Opponent's Ar
rest for Battery.
"WORDS LED TO FIGHTING
Only the Principals Were Present
When the Scandalous Affair
\ Commenced.
Oakland Office Sah Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 26. j
Attorney C. T. Johns and William
Clift, father of Justice Cliit, had an en-
Counter this morning in the vestibule of
the Hall of Records. Both are men who
ere well along in years. Clift is the older,
but Johns is crippled in both hands as the
result of a mining accident several years
ago. As a result of the meeting the attor
ney swore out a warrant for the arrest of
the Judge's father on a charge of battery.
Attorney Johns said that he was going
into the County Clerk's office, where he
came face to face with William Clift.
"As soon as he saw me," said Mr. Johns,
"he said he had been wanting to see me
for some time. He then said: 'You have
been making derogatory remarks about
nay son Frea for some time past.' I stopped
him by saying: 'Hold on, you should ask
me it I have made any remarks about
him.' I told him if he knew I had done
bo it was useless to discuss the subject,
and was walking off when he grabbed me
by trie coat and struck me in the left eye
with his right hand. When Attorney
Ayers appeared I told him that Clift had
struck me and that I was crippled, and 1
Bsked Ayers to take him away. Cilft
called me a liar and struck me in the right
eye. Avers then pulled nim away.
"I suppose Clift" referred to a remark I
made about his son. I said he did not
know enough law to run his office, and I
repeat it now."
Justice Clift was seen this evening, and
said: "Johns tried a case before me, and I
gave judgment against him. He
cut and talked about me on the street.
Tbe trouble arose over our fees. The law
says that when a party appeals from a
judgment they must pay the Justice's
fees. When he gave notice of appeal I
told him of tbis and it made him mad.
The law requires plaintiffs in all actions
to pay costs on filing suit, and this I en
force "in al) cases, both with Stewart and
others, and it was otly the Justice's fee
that remained in the suit referred to."
Cbarles H. Ayers, who descended the
stairs during the trouble, said to-nignt
that he saw Johns was getting the worst
of it, and so he pushed one to one side and
one to the other.

lreshmen and sophomores who took part
in the interclass "rush" last night were
going about the campus to-day complain
ing of lame backs, sore head's, strained
muscles and bruised shoulders. Some of
them were sorry-looking sights, but for
all their hard knocks they bore the situa
tion bravely. The most serious of. all the
flesh wounds which the freshmen and
eophomores carried were the cuts on their
lianas and wrists received from the knives
of the co-eds, who were attempting
to loosen the bonds of baling rope and
twine which held the fighting collegians.
The freshmen in view of their victory have
declared that they will carry canes from
now henceforth.
This morning the small boys of the town
had a harvest of knives, rings, coins and
trinkets belonging to the rushing students
which had been lost in last evening's rush.
A number of signs asking for information
leading to the recovery of articles lost last
night were posted on the bulletin boards
of the University to-day.

ALAMEDA'S TIDAL CANAL
Is It Necessary to Preserve the
Depth of Oakland
Harbor?
A Member of the Assembly From the
Forty-Seventh District to Be
Elected in November.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 26.â E. A. yon
Scnmidt, the well-known civil engineer, is
of opinion tnat the completion of the tidal
canal is of as much importance to Oakland
as to Alameda, both from a commercial
and sanitary standpoint. He has expressed
his views to that end at length, conclud
ing: "Just now Oakiand wants ships.
Later on Oakland will want health more
than she now yearns for commerce. The
Alameda tidal canal is even a greater
necessity for Oakland's future success than
it is for Alameda's. Oakland is on the lee
! side, Alameda to windward principally.
Alameda will get the canal m time, and
Oakland will be the greatest power in
favor of it."

ber, from the Forty-seventh District,
i which comprises Alameda City, Brooklyn
township and a part of Eden township.

ONCE IN JEOPARDY.
A Plea Which Failed to Save Ed. Wick
ham From a Second Conviction.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 26.--Edward
Wickbam was arraigned before Judge
Greene this morning but refused to plead.
Instead, he entered a plea of once in
jeopardy. The court ordered a plea of
"not guilty" entered and summoned a
venire of twenty-five men from which a
jury was ordered selected.
Wickham was one of the railroad
strikers in 1894, but turned informer.
After matters were settled he was let out
to shift for himself. On June 3, 1894, he
rented a horse and buggy from P. W.
Baker, drove to Fresno and sold the outfit.
He was brought back, bound over for trial,
tried and convicted. Â«
His case was appealed to the Supreme
Court on the ground that the District
Attorney's office had failed to file informa
tion against him within thirty days from
the time he was held. The court decided
in his favor July 22, 1896, and ordered his
release if the District Attorney failed to
show good reason why the information
had not been presented. This he failed to
do at a hearing before Judge Ogden and
tne prisoner was ordered released. He
was arrested again on the same charge,
hence tne trial to-day.
These matters were presented to the
jury after the case for the people had been
submitted, but failed to save him, for the
jury again returned a verdict of guilty.

Most Influential Jury Ever
in the Police
Court.
DINGEE'S LIBEL SUITS.
Millionaires, Bankers and Ex-
Officials Examined as

M4JOR BROMLEY'S OPINION.
Attorney Foote Would Not Undertake
the Task of Trying to
Shake It.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 26. f
The most distinguished jury that ever
sat in the local Police Court will try the
libel suit brought against Gavin Dhu
High, ex-editor of the Times, by W. J.
Dingee, president of the Oakland Water
Company. It is composed of ex-Mayor
C. D. Pierce, ex-Supervisor D. C. brown,
ex-School Director Frank R. Girard, Major
E. W. Woodward, E. C. Sessions
dent Oakland Bank of Savings), Christian
Schreiber, A. H. Lake, Edward Arnert,
Charles P. Clark, Thomas Smith, W.
Scheeline and Hugh Hamilton.
It took nearly the whole day to agree on
the men who should fill the jury-box
while Mr. High attempts to prove that
what he said about Mr. Dingee was true,
and therefore not malicious libel. The day
was uot lost to the influential lobby that
gathered to hear the trial in which the
whole commercial and capitalistic ele
ments of the city are interested.
W. W. Foote was present to represent
Mr. Dingee. Prosecuting Attorney Harry
Melvin represented the people, and Attor
ney Garnty represented Mr. Rigii. W. A.
Beatty, Mr. High's former attorney, was
engaged in the Supreme Court and could
not be pretent.
The first tiff occurrel over the defend
ant's request for a continuance because of
Mr. Beatty's absence. Attorney Foote
said that Attorney Garrity could have no
objection to impaneling the jury. Mr.
Melvin objected vigorously to keeping
seventy business men hanging around
the courtroom and wasting their time,
and wished to get the jury, after which a
continuance might be granted.
"While it is but right that the defend
ant should wish his counsel to be at his
trial," said Mr. Melvin, "Attorney Gar
rity is really more capable to pick an Oak
land jury "than Mr. Beatty, as he knows
the venire."
It was finally settled to proceed with
the impaneling of the jury. The first
boxful only produced three who were ac
ceptable to both sides.
Frederick Delger, probably the richest
man in Oakland, was on the venire, and
modestly stated that he believed he was
on tlie assessment roll. He had, how
ever, read the article on which the suit is
based and had formed a definite opinion
about it, and so he was excused.
Major J. L. Bromiey said he had an
opinion unfavorable to Mr. Hisrh.
"We won't object to a challenge," said
Mr. Foote. "I have known the major ior
twenty-five years, and I Know that he is
pretty certain to stay with his opinion if
he lias one."
While Charles Jurgens was being ex
amined he said he would not believe Mr.
High under oath. Mr. Footfl looked sur
prised, and Attorney Garrity said to Mr.
Jurgens: "You and Mr. High had some
trouble over an article which he published
about you and your tenants, did you
not?"
"Yes," replied Mr. Jurgens, "and he
promised to correct it the next day and
did not keep his word. 1 '
"Of course, I deny all of this," said Mr.
High. â¢
"I went to see him about the piece,"
said Jurgens, "and he promised to correct
it the next day, and did not keep his
word."
"It is not so," broke in Mr. High.
"Now, look here," said Mr. Melvin,
springing to his feet, "I want this man
to keep quiet or be sent downstairs until
he cools off. He is not brought here to
testify, and he has no right to act this
way."
Thus the day was spent, and during
the afternoon the jury-box was full.
Court then adjourned, and the taking of
testimony will begin to-morrow.

KELLY STANDS FIRM.
Ho and His Friends Will Have No
Fusion In the Fifth.
The Demopopulist fusion scheme has
received vigorous setbacks almost hourly
since its inception, but one of the most
vigorous ones has been met with in the
Fifth district.
Joseph P. Kelly, the regular Democratic
nominee, has been found by the managers
of the scheme to be a man who will not
be pulled down at the suggestion of a
handful of party manipulators who are
seeking party power and patronage.
Mr. Kelly has not yet spoken in regard
to the peaaing fusion scheme, and is not
likely to do so unless ha it formally asked
for his resignation by the committee of
fifteen politicians. Some of his friends in
timate that if the party authorities do re
quest his resignation Mr. Kelly will be
heard from In very vigorous style.
At any rate Mr. Kelly's resignation is
not at the service of any small committee
of politicians who may assume to be en
titled to usurp the functions of the party
voters â¢ and to overturn absolutely the
action of any popular Darty convention.
Joseph P. Kelly, whatever may be his
qualifications for the office, has a host ol
valiant friends in the party who will re
bel outright if six ambitious Democrats,
six ambitious Populists and three ambi
tious "silverites," decide in a back room
that Mr. Kelley must come off the ticket.
Kelly and his friends are especially in
censed at the proposition because two
years ago the Democratic State Central
Committee concluded to condemn Kelly
after he was nominated by the district
convention and to indorse Loud, the Re
publican nominee. Kelly made a strong
run and the result seemed to indicate that
Kelly would have gone to Washington in
stead of Loud if Denman had not been
put into the fight against him by his own
party.
Now Mr. Kelly has been vindicated by
the Democrats of the Fifth District by re
ceiving again the party nomination. But
now comes the State Central Committee
again, by a special committee of six,
named and controlled by the party bosses,
with a proposition that Mr. Kelly shall
again come down from the ticket. This is
regarded by Kelly's friends as nothing less
than sheerpersecution. The main motive
of Kelly and his friends in seeking his
nomination this year was the ambition to
obtain a vindication.
Two years ago Kelly's Populist oppo
nent was Taylor Rogers, who has been
nominated by the Populists again. It is
current information on the inside of poli
tical circles that Rogers was induced the
other day to declare that he would chip
his resignation into the general Dot, in the
low-down assurance that he would be the
fusion candidate.
The people in power in the present
State campaign are largely the ones who
influenced the action in Kelly's case two
years ago, who, according to the general
party belief in the district, elected the
Republican candidate, and they are also
of the element which unsuccessfully op
posed Kelly's nomination this year.
There ia no question that the plan is to
turn down Kelly regardless of the action
or wishes ol the Democrats of the district.
It is also beyond question that the.scheme
in its present stage involves the indorse
ment of Taylor Rogers, the Populist can
didate, who hag little or nothing in com
mon with the Chicago free-silver platform,
being an avowed fiac money man, by
authority of a pamphlet he circulated as
widely as he is able to do.
Kelly has already made ten speeches in
the course of his campaign and is sche
duled for meetings for every night of this
week. Onthe platform he has taken a
bold stand in opposition to any form of
a funding bill, has declared for the free
coinage of silver and for the Nicaragua
cuna 1 and has also done the proper thing
by declaring for the improvement of the
Alviso and Redwood City sloughs. His
opponents about the State headquarters
have been talking about his being a South
ern Pacific attorney, but his friends are
loudly declaring that they are trying to
mix him up with a certain other Attorney
Kelly in this City and that he has not only
never had a Southern Pacific case but tha^
he has for years repeatedly appeared as
attorney against the railroad in damage
suits.
"What consideration should force Mr.
Kelly to surrender to a self-constituted
committee the verdict of the people of his
district?" asked a prominent Democrat
last night. "The National Committee
would be as much justified in asking
Bryan for his resignation because some
vague fusion scheme was beins played.
There is no precedent in all the history of
American politics for the action that a
little handful of party bosses are now try
ing to take. Furthermore there is no
justification for it in the principles and
methods of American party politics. If
you consider the thing soberly for a min
ute you will see that it is not only unjust
and'revolutionary, but a dangerous prece
dent.
"If a dozen or so men who happen to
run the practical course of party affairs
after the people have decided on their
principles and candidates may overturn
all the work of such conventions at their
whim what may become of popular party
government? Any municipal or legis
lative campaign committee miuht proceed
to do the same thing under control of a
boss or a small set of bosses after the
proper deal had been made. It is a dan
gerous thing for a small set of ambitious
politicians to repudiate the action of the
people when they have expressed their
will through convention delegates elected
by clubs or by popular vote when the
issues and the men at sttke are well
known."
Mr. Kelly and Mr. Kelly's friends pre
sent to the fusion committee a hard nut to
crack.
BRYAN SILVER CLUBS.
Extended System of District Organ-
ization Soon to Be Got Into
Working- Order.
A meeting of the organization com
mittee of the California Silver Campaign
Committee was called last evening for the
purpose of taking steps toward the forma
tion of district clubs throughout the City.
The active work of organization in the
districts is to be commenced uext week.
There was considerable discussion as to
the scope of the proposed clubs. The
committee strongly intimated that it
would not recognize factions in any of the
political parties, and that it would not
extend its activity in the election of local
candidates beyond the Legislative nom
inees. In other words, it did not propose
to take any hand in municipal politics.
The committee ratfied the action of its
conference committee in the formation of
the Congressional fusion plan and the
appointment of Charles D. Lane, William
P. Lawlor and James P. Edhoff to serve
on the joint Congressional conference
committee.

GERMAN FRIENDS
OF REPUBLICANISM
Movement on Foot for the
Organization of a
Club.
ENTHUSIASM IS RIFE.
Large Number of Leading Citi
zens Interested in the
Project.
THE IDEA IN GENERAL FA YOB.
Prospective Marshaling of an In*
fluentia! and Desirable Civic
Element
A movement is on foot for the formation
of a Republican club, to be composed of
German-Americans. For some weeks
past the project has been evolving in the
minds of leading residents of German
birth or descent. Among the citizens
most interested in the proposed organiza
tion may be mentioned such men as H. F.
Maass. William Bchroeder, Charles P.
Rode, Dr. F. P. Mufte, Robert Wieneke of
the Golden West Hotel, Charles Drescher,
W. Plagemann, F. M. French and Dr. A.
E. Brune.
A call has been issued for a mass-meet
ing of German- American citizens, to be
held to-morrow evening at Norman's Hall,
413 Bush street, commencing at 8 o'clock.
At this meeting an effort will be made to
effect the organization of a club, to be
known as the German-American Republi
can Club. The number of German-speak
ing Republicans in the City is Known to
be large, and the importance of the issues
involved in the coming election has
stirred up among them a strong desire to
take a well-defined, united and harmoni
ous stand for their party and its policy.
"I hope," said Dr. Brune last night,
"that the invitation to the meeting will
be accepted by a large number of the
German citizens. A great many of them â
and among that many are some of the
leading business men of the Cityâ are
stanch Republicans. To unite these
strong elements into a powerful organiza
tion seems to be the general desire of the
German Republican residents.
"We have no cut-and-dried plan of or
ganization. Indeed, the call was issued in
obedience to the prevailing sentiment
among tbe Republican citizens who hail
from, the Fatherland. Beyond a doubt
the attendance will be large, and the fu
ture of the movement can be more easily
predicted when the views of the majority
shall have been ascertained. At present
it is too early to venture any prophecies,
but I hope ereat things for the yet unborn
German-American Republican Club."
"The idea seems to have met with gen
eral favor and acceptance among the Ger
man Republicans with whom I have
spoken," commented Mr. Wieneke.
"Such a club as the one contemplated
must prove a potent force in rallying a de
sirable class of citizens about a common
standard. With such an organization, I
doubt not, we could make many converts.
But it is rather early to build air-castles.
I think, or at least I trust the club will
soon be doing good work. The enthusi
asm with which the project has been taken
up is certainly a moit encouraging au
eury."
Visitor* From Abroad.
Tracy T. Jeffords, an attache of the
United States Land Department in Wash
ington, D. C, was in this City to-day. He
reports that the silver craze is fast dying
out and that the wage-worker is learning
that he, not the capitalist, will be injured
by the free coinage of silver. The wage
worker is awakening to a realization of
the fact that when he is paid in silver and
must pay the principal and interest on his
mortgage in gold he will appreciate that
laws cannot make values.
William H. Bonsalls of Los Angeles,
who is visiting friends here, repoits that
the friends of protection. and of an honest
dollar for the workingman are increasing
in numbera every day. HiÃ statement is
confirmed by William Niles and Aaron
Smith of the same place.
B. J. Watson of Nevada City says that
the people of that city are true blue for
the true blue American principle of pro
tection and sound money.
Cassasa's Band.
Cassasa's band will play next Saturday
evening at Pioneer Hall and in the rooms

rooms of the league, it will be of a more
than ordinarily hilarious and entertain
ing nature. There will be singing by glee
clubs, vocal solos and instrumental selec
tions, and some of the best speakers in the
State have signified their intention to be
present.
Joseph C. Campbell, a most graceful
and forceful speaker, will address the
Pboenix Club this evening In wjottish
Hall on Larkin street. There will be
music and other entertaining features.
The gallery will be reserved for ladies and
their escorts.
The Phoenix Drill Corps, numbering

lant Thomas O'Neill, have been practic
ing marching evolutions by moonlight on
Van Ness avenue, and are able to hold
their own with any other similar organi
zation in the State.

Lord Sudeley of England, who has been
on a visit to the cold mines of Trail Creek,
in British Columbia, where he owns dif
ferent mining interests.
He is accompaniea by Arthur Pease of
London, who has been here a number of
times hitherto,. and is interested in Cali
fornia mines. Lord Sudeley, it is said,
will examine into some mines here. He
said last nitfht that he haa never before
been in the United States.
As to the money question, which is be

THEY FAVOR FREE LUNCH
Liquor-dealers' and Barkeepers'
Association a Unit on
the Subject
They Say It Is Detrimental to No
One and a Benefit to
Many.
The Pacific Coast Retail Liquor-dealers'
and Barkeepers' Protective Association
held a numerously attended meeting last
night at the hall at 539 California street.
They adopted a constitution and by-laws
as prepared by a committee previously
appointed, indorsed the Liquor- dealers'
Journal as the official organ of the organi
zation, and adopted a vote of thanks to
the newspapers of the City which have
extended various courtesies and published
their minutes and notices.
The principal feature of the meeting
was the adoption of the following resolu
tions:
Whereas, Certain parties and organizations
are endeavoring to secure the passage by the
Board of Supervisors of this City and County
of an ordinance prohibiting the liquor-dealers
of this City from distributing free lunch to
their customers; and whereas, such an ordi
nance would not only be unconstitutional as
class legislation, but a hardship on the work
ingmen of this City, many of whom, owing to
the low wages now prevailing, would b9
obliged to go without their noonday meal in
the event of the passage and enforcement of
such a law; and whereas, the distribution of,
hot lunch free of charge is a detriment to no
one and a benefit to many; now therefore be it
Resolved, That the Pacific Coast Retail Liquor
dealers' and Barkeepers' Protective Associa
tion does most earnestly condemn all parties
or organizations seeking the passage of such an
ordinance or endeavoring in any manner to
interfere with the rights of the retail liquor
dealers ol this City to carry on their business
according to the laws of this State now exist
ing.
This brought out a spirited discussion,
not in opposition to it, but in emphasizing
its sentiments. The expression was
freely made that the abolition of the
free lunch was sought only by high-priced
and high-toned saloons, whose efforts to
outdo each other in costly show arc cost
ing them large sums and bringing them
decided loss.
A committee consisting of James W. Bu
chanan, E. Lauterbach, C. G. Keller, Tim
othy Regan and F. Davy was &rÂ»poiuted to
interview the brewers and wholesale deal
ers of the City to endeavor to enlist their
substantial support for the maintenance of
the association.
STOCKTON'S CARNIVAL.
Interesting Features Being Prepared
by Energetic Citizens.
Among the arrivals from Stockton last
evening were three young men who are in
terested in tiie coming Stockton carnival.
Major Gus G. Grant is the chairman of the
carnival committee. Ho is here to make
arrangements for launches, barges and
music. Judge H. R. McNoble is the chair
man of the transportation committee. To
day he will interview the Southern Pacific
people to see if he can get better than the
ordinary passenger rates. Prom what can
be learned the railroad company is not
inclined to allow the carnival manage
ment a 9 good terras as are given to secret
and fraternal bodies.
Judge McNoble also desires the South
ern Pacific, the San Joaquin Valley and
the Lodi Terminal railroads to make a
locomotive display on "Weber avenue, on
which there is a mile of double tracks and
on which tbÂ«Â» line of march has been. laid
out.
Robert W. Maitland of this City, who is
the secretary of the joint committees of
the carnival, will assist the two gentlemen
from Stockton in their efforts to make the
event a grand success.

NO ANSWER FROM BRYAN
Italian Democrats Lose Hope
of the Insults Being
Denied.
Mast Believe That the Nebraska Man
Hates and Despises Their
Nationality.
There was no softening in the feelings
against Bryan expressed yesterday by
Italian residents. The few Italian Demo
crats who still pin their faith to the
Nebraska rcan weakened visibly when
they found that no reply had come to
L' Itaiia's t^lepram to the World-Herald
of Nebraska, asking if any denial was
forthcoming to Bryan's insulting edi
torials respecting Italians.
So many Italian votes are at stake, all
over the country, that it is believed some
effort would be made to stem the rising
tide of indignation, by denying or explain
ing away the obnoxious editorials, if there
were any loophole by which it could be
done. Italian rjapers are beginning to air
the idea that it is intolerant newspaper
articles such as those of Bryan on Italian
immigration whicn have aroused the feel
ing of odium against Italians that in some
cases has culminated in lynching. L' ltalia
says:
The real people to blame are those babblers
like Bryan, who in their discourses arouse the
American people against Italian immigrants
by describing them as professional assassins,
who go through life with a stiletto in their
bands ready to kill. Naturally these opinions,
continually hurled at the public, arouse a feel
ing of hatred against Italians, hatred which,
when the opportune moment comes, explodes
in those collective crimes in which the
"Italian hunt" assumes the most tragic and
terrible forms.
There is outcry enough against anarchists
for preaching hatred of the rich and powerful
and fomenting crime. Well, Bryan, and all
the other demagogues who do as he does In
continually throwing a sinister light on the
name of Italian, are really more criminal than
the anarchists, because they direct their tirades
against one single nation, wnich, notwithstand
ing, has so many claims on civilization.
L'Elvczia, the local organ of the Italian
speaking Swiss population, in quoting the
World-Herald's editorials against Italians,
says:
With Bryan in power it would be more than
probable that the present restrictions on
Italian immigration would be converted into
an absolute decree ot exclusion.

LETTER-CARRIERS MEET.
The Delegation to the National Conven
tion Will tabor for San Francisco.
A meeting of the Letter-carriers' Asso
ciation was held in Judge Conlan's court
room last night.
The meeting was for the purpose of hear
ing from the committee â consisting of
R. H. Roche, I. C. Levy and F. E. Bmithâ
which had been appointed to make lull ar
rangements for the San Francisco delega
tion which will leave this City on next
Tuesday for Grand Rapids, where the Na
tional convention will convene on the 7th
of Sep'ember.
The San Francisco delegates, B. Frank
Ames, J. Stephen Sullivan and Roland
M. Roche, with those from Sacramento,
Oakiand and Los Angeles, will labor in
dustriously to have the next National
Convention meet in this City.
To accomplish this the committee of ar
rangements has secured from the wine
merchants of this City fifty cases of Cali
i fornia wines including champagne, sweet
[ and dry wines, besides a promise of a car
load of fresh California fruit, which J. A.
Filcher, secretary and manager of the
I State Board of Trade, promised to forward
so us to be on hand on the night the ban
quet will be held.
In addition to this Captain W. L.
Merry, chairman of the Chamber of Com
merce, proffered them all the assistance
in his power and offered them the use of
the Chamber of Commerce rooms rent
free in which to hold the meeting should
the convention come here.
A. A. Watkins, president of the Board
of Trade, through Secretary H. 8. Smith,
gave all the encouragement he could and
promised them the co-operation of the
merchants in their behalf.

908 Broadway, Aue. 26. j
When the sun sinks into the Pacific off
Los Angeles next Saturday night the peo
ple of that city will witness their burg bap
tized by a Republican fire from Central
California.
"What's the matter with McKinley?"
Commander Varney Gaskill will shout.
"He's all right, you betâ every timeâ
hip-hip-rah, hip-hip-rah â Alliance â Al
liance â rah-rah-rahâ McKinley."
VARXEY GASKILL, COMMANDER OF THE ALLIANCE.
"W ho?" will come from the iron lungs
of the commander and all the invaders
will shout, "McKinley."
Immediately following the flares from
full 200 fiery flambeaux will shoot into the
air and the peaceful people of the City of
the Angels vrill know that the Republican
Alliance has the freedom of their city.
There is never anything small about the
Alliance. They are as magnanimous as the
doctrine they uphold, and when the invi
tation to go to Los Angeles was received
it was at once resolved that a few mem
bers should not drift there like corporal's
guards cast adrift, but that they should go
in a body. They mu3t go with glory and
return with more, so a special train was
chartered, uniforms were renewed or re
furnished, and with flags, banners, music
and torches the Alliance will leave the
mole on Friday night amid the cheers of
those less tortunate than members of the
organization.
And tbey will not forget their mascot.
The colored gentleman who carries the
large transparent globe at the head of
every Alliance procession will not be per
mitted to remain behind. Considerable
doubt exists in the minds of many as to
the real name of the Alliance mascot. At
a recent cake-walk at the Macdonough
Theater "John" was introduced to the au
dience as "Mr. Hanhin." John is a fix
ture at Hanitin's, which is in close prox
imity to the Athenian Club, which em
braces several members of the Alliance,
therefore John is a necessity in more
ways than one, and Commander Gaskill
or President Morrroni will not walk with
half the rride that will cause John's
bosom to heave when he twirls the globe
at Los Angeles.
Up to 9 o'clock to-night about 120 berths
have been engaged.

. The Republican Alliance was organized
. on Sunday morning' August 3, 1884, in the
cellar of the cottage at 1424 Webster street,
then occupied by Alien Knight. It was
the successor to the Union League of 1880.
At. the first gathering there were present
the following, who are yet connected with
the club: Harry F. Gordan. Fred S. Strat
ton, F. E. Bigham and W. B. Hamilton.
The others at thaUmeeting were Allen
Knijjht, A. F. Coffin. C. O. Alexander,
John Lathrop. G. C. Pratt, A. P. Redding
and B. F. Stone. Xhere were forty-six
applications for membership at a meeting
held eight days later, making the charter
membership fifty-seven.
The first president was A. F. Cotfin and
the first commanderof the military branch
Colonel W. C. Little. At the bi-annual
election in 1886 R. H. Orton was elected as
president. He was succeeded in 1888 by
L. L. Bromwell, who was re-elected in
1890, 1892 and 1894. Colonel Little was re
elected to srcceed himself in bis depart
ment all this time and drilled the club
each year. Mr. Bromwell resigned in 1894
and Victor H. Metcalf as vice-president
completed the term.
This year George P. Morrow was chosen
to the presidency and Varney Gaskill was
elected to succeed Colonel Little.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, AUGUST 27, 1896.
The Alliance, with its globe and natty
uniforms, has been the feature of many
Republican demonstrations both about
the bay and the interior of the State.
They always travel by special train, and
turn out in great numbers. They have
been to Sacramento and San Jose several
times, and once to Stockton. They turn
out at all big gatherings in this city, Ala
meda and Haywards, and have been over
to San Francisco many times.
The trip to Los Angeles is the first of
such a distance and much interest has
been shown by all members. The drills
have been especially well attended and* as
a result the clubs will make a remarkably
fine showing when they appear Saturday.
They will leave Oakland mole at 7 o'clock
Friday night on what is known as "The
Alliance Special" and will be in Los Ange
les for breaKfast at 8 :30.
After a few hours for rest and sight
seeing the special will be run to Pasadena,
where the club will take part in the meet
ing to be held there at 1 o'clock. Follow
ing this the special will be run back to
Los Angeles in time to alow the members
to clean up and get dinner before going
out to take part in the great demonstra
tion being prepared for Saturday evening.
After the parade the club is to be ban
queted. Sunday is to be devoted to
rest and sight-seeing. Tbe start home will
be made at 6 o'clock and the train is to
arrive here so as to allow members to
reach San Francisco at 8:15 Monday
morning.
This morning Commander Varney W.
Gaskill issued his final orders to his com
rades. The concluding paragraph fairly
expresses the spirit of the Alliance. It is
as follows:
"Study, understand and p ractice all the
above instructions. They are the secrets
of a fine military appearance. The people
of Los Angeles and elsewhere expect great
things from the Alliance. We can easily
exceed every expect ation. Let us all co
operate to make the fame of the Alliance
as a crack military corps even greater than
it is."
YOUNG REPUBLICANS.
President Frank K. Spencer Detlv-
ers an Earnest Address on
the Silver Question.
The Young Men's Republican League
held an enthusiastic meeting in Justice of
the Peace Kerrigan's courtroom lastnieht.
There was a large attendance, and several
new names were enrolled.
President Frank K. Spencer delivered
George Hannifin, Mascot of the Repub
lican Alliance.
an earnest address on the silver question,
which he characterized as a side issue to
draw the attention of the masses away
from the real issue in the campaign, pro
tection against free trade. He declared
that the effervescence caused by Bryan's
Chicago address was being rapidly dis
pelled, and people were now rapidly re
alizing what free silver would really mean.
The tide was on the turn, and McKioley

FREE COINAGE OF IRON
What an Atlanta Man Has to
Say on That Absorbing
Subject.
MR. ESTEE'S GREAT SPEECH.
Lawyer Campbell Will Address the
Phoe-.iix Clnbâ Saturday Night's
Great Events.
Friends of Morris M. Estee say that his
speech to be delivered at the Auditorium
next Saturday night will be the crowning
effort of his life.
The subject will be the two issues now
before the people, namely, "Protection to
American Industries" and "The Financial
Issue."
Mr. Estee has devoted considerable time
and research to the preparation of his
speech, and it will be printed as one of the
most valuable and effective documents on
the shelves of Republican campaign
libraries.
Seats in the gallery will be reserved for
ladies and their escorts.
THE IRON DOLLAR.
Arguments o f an Atlanta Man Fa-
voring Additional Free
Coinage.
An Atlanta man has written the follow
ing argument on the free coinage of the
iron dollar at the ratio of 16 to 1. The Re
publican State Central Committee of this
State intends to have it printed as a
campaign document:
The Demonetization of Iron.
Alexander P. Hull of Atlanta is a strong 16
to 1 man. He does not believe in half-way
measures. The free coinage of silver idea is
too tame for Him. He is willing to see the
silveritcs and go them 100 points better. Here
is his declaration, proposition and argument:
Having been deeply impressed with the ar
guments of Judge Crisp, Bryan, Stewart.
Jones and others, and especially grieved,
shocked and horrified by the "awful crime of
1873," as so luridly depicted daily in the col
umns of the Atlanta constitution and other
silver organs, I have changed my views on the
money question and am ready to maintain the
propositions iollowing in joint debate or news
paper controversy.
I accept the arguments ot the advocates of
silver and agree with their remedy, as far as
it goes. However, it does not go far enough.
Let us Have plenty of remedyâ in fact, enough
to make debt and poverty things of tiie past,
relics of the, dark ages. I am in favor of the
free and unlimited coinage of pig iron at a
ratio of 16 to 1 with gold by the United States
alone, independently of all nations, and can
prove by the best authority that such a policy
on the part of the United States will "raise
prices," put plenty of money into circulation
and give the "honest debtor a chance to pay
his debts," thereby makiug the whole country
prosperous.
Now, in the first place, It may be urged by
some who do not understand the subject of
"standards of value," tnat a free coinage act
for iron would not raise its price to a ratio of
16 to 1 with gold. To them I reply that "the
stamp of this Government" and the "legal
tender qualities" of the iron dollar would in
stantly make the bullion value of pig.lron the
same as the mint value. "For who would part
with an ounce of this precious metal for any
thing less than the mint value?" (Stewart,
Jones, Bryan.)
Again, it may be urged that our mint would
be overcrowded with pig iron. I reply that
the price oi pig iron having been raised from
$7 50 a ton to a ratio of lt> to 1 with gold the
world over, "no one would especially care to
carry it to the mints, since the mint price
could be obtained anywhere in the open mar
ket" (Atlanta Constitution). Next it may be
urged that gold and silver might go out of cir
culation. I reply, first, "This is a mere
assumption of the tools of the money power,
which they cannot verify" (Atlanta Consti
tution). Second, "Suppose gold and siiver do
go out of circulation, is there not plenty of
pig iron to take their place and give the people
plenty of money?" (Bryan). And third, "Such
an assumption mixes the ideas of circulating
medium and standard of value. Gold and sil
ver would still be potential money metals,
though not in circulation, and would lend
their help toward raising prices and causing
general prosperity" (Crisp).
Then again, it may be urged against the
pig-iron standard of value that wages would
not rise in proportion to prices. The reply
is, "Wages will be compelled to rise since no
man would be fool enough to work for $1 a
day who could make $1000 per day by picking
up rusty nails and old horseshoes and carry
ing them to the mint for coinage" (Hull).
In addition it may be urged by the money
power, by the "'Wall-street sharks" and the
"Bond-street shylocks" that we do not alone
go on a pig-iron basis without an international
agreement. "To such dastards as dare to lay a
limit to the power of the American people to
do what they please, independently of all
nations, 1 hurl their cowardice and lack of
patriotism back to their faces" (Bryan).
The crime of demonetizing the iron took
place about 2200 years ago, when certain
"goldolators" and "silverites" in order to in
crease the purchasing power of their ill
gotten wealth, secretly, and "like thieves in the
night " got the demonetization act passed, re
pealing the good old coinage act of Lycurgus,
the "friend oi our ancestors' daddies." To
day China is the only country on earth honest
enough to coin iron, and there the happy
laborers can carry home the wages of their
honest toil in the wheelbarrow (Atlanta
Constitution).
A ruinous fall in prices followed the de
monetization of iron, and has continued for
upward of 2000 years. I have calculated the
loss entailed upon tne honest people of this
world by that ruthless act, and the figures are
so enormous I fear a revolution will ensue if
the people learn how greatly they have been
robbed. But the facts are facts, and the best
way to right a wrong is to meet it squarely.
The loss is $21,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
--000,000,000 (Coin's Financial School).
In conclusion, I insist that the free coinage
of pig iron will do everything that is claimed
for silver, and infinitely more. The people
will be rich and prosperous. The once poor
man can Day his debts with his old stove.
Rail roaas can declare dividends on old rails
and worn-out rolling stock. The small boy
can pick up old nails and horse shoes enough
to support the family. In fine, poverty and
debt can no longer exist (Atlanta Journal).
Women's Republican Club.
The Women's Republican State Club
held its regular weekly meeting last night.
The ladies present bound themselves
under a tirm resolve that each would win
over one Democratic voter to ttie cause of
McKinley and protection before the day
of election.
It was decided that the badge of the
club should be worn by all the members
during their attendance at the club meet
ings: also that the McKinley and Hobart
button shall be worn by each member
from n6w until the 3d day of November.
