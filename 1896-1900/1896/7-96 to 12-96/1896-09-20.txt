VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 112.
GOLDEN STATE PROSPERITY
Ringing Republican Speech by
Hon. Irving M. Scott at the
Auditorium,
A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
Masterly Exposition of the Advantages of American
Protection and Sound Money â Cheers
for McKinley.
The enthusiasm for William McKinley t
seems to prow with each succeeding Re- !
publican meeting and each passing hour i
of the cam pa gn. The Auditoriam, where j
Irving M. Scott spoke last evening, was â¢
an illustration of this progressive Re
publicanism.
A brass band played in front of the main
entrance. But it was not necessary to
drum up a crowd. Ths crowd was already
th rft, La A an hour before the Dand, wait-.j
iner in long, increasing rows for the doors \
of the big building to open. Wben the
band marched down the aisle playing the
enthusing stiains of "Marching Through
Georgia," the vast audience waved its bats
and handkerchiefs and cheered.
Irving M. Scott, president of the Union
Iron Works, was to deliver the address of j
tho eveuing. When Mr, Scott appeared
the audience refused to longer contain
itself, and burst into an ovation which the '
builder of battle-ships acknowledged with j
a modest bow. The nail was conspicu- j
ously ornamented with portraits of the
man of Canton, with mottoes of "'Protec
tion and Prosperity," and such other em- i
blems of Republicanism that showed the j
promise of higher wages and happier '
Homes.
\V. C. Johnson was chairman. The \
meeting was unaer the auspices of the Re
publican State Central Committee. Many
ladies decorated the expansive audience
with their interesting laces and the colors
of their costumes.
The Sam Booth Glee Club opened the
meeting with a song in which this promi
nent refrain was loudly applauded:
Sixteen to 1 with me this year don't go.
Chairman W. C. Johnson made a brief j
opening address. He expressed the un
derstanding that the audience had "come
to listen to thai one who had brougnt j
prosperity to tl.is City and established one !
of the grandest institutions in the United !
States. You can look around yoa," lie 1
said, "'and see before you, perhaps, the j
grea'est ship-buiider of the world. [Ap
piause.] Another snip has been granted
to him, and I hope more like him may

spring up and bring prosperity to this
coast. McKiniey means vrosperity. [Cheers
and applause.] When we put our shoulders
to the who 1 next November we will elect
Wil.iam McKinley President of the UniieU
States."
Whenever McKinley'a name was men
tioned it was greeted with enthusiaetic
cheers.
"He does not have to go bellowing
aroun.i the country. The workin:rmen go
to see him. HÂ« is a statesman, which is
more than we can say of Mr. Bryan.
Bryan may be a good man, but he is in |
bad company."
He then introduced Irving M. Scott. I
There were hurrahs and cheers for him.
Mr. Scott said substantially:
I have struggled with you here shoulder to I
â¢houlder In many a contest in this port, and I
hot>e we shall stick together till we shall have
ths world bowing to us, the Pacific Coast, in
reverence. When we completea our first snip,
the Caarleston, taen there came a recognition '
that the Pacific Coast had never known be- j
fore. [Applause.]
Then there came the San Francisco, the
Olyraj'ia and then the Oregon, floating like a
white swan on the blue waters. Last Tut-day
when the word came of the other ships 10
buiM we felt gratified, for it meant that there
would not he a closing of ihe Union Iron
Works for at least three years, and it, had in it
the 4 per cent protection act. Yesterday we
received word that they had awarded us a 30- I
knot torpedo-destroyer on the plans of tne
Union Iron Works in competition with the
United States.
Now, fellow-citizens, the building of these
ships means about $12,000,000 out of the
Federal treasury, nearly every dollar of which
goes to labur. You will have bot.l the ships
and the money. [Applause.] Therefore I can
not bui believe tbai the doctrine of protection
is true in these branches of industry as well as
in the mechanical arts. If you are true to the
doctrine of protection there is work here for
every pair of idle hands.
Never before in the history of this country
has there been a political party which pro
poses to stuff the Supreme Court. No party
can do that and hope to win. No man is all
that he wants to be. I wish I could be. I'd
lift this State into a condition of the greatest
prosperity from its silver sunlit mountain
peaks to its valleys.
D:d yÂ»u ev-r hear of 16 to 1 ? Open the
factories of America to American workmen
instead of opening the mints to the silver of
the world! [Applause.]
You have heard of the crime of '73. I know
William Stewart, personally, and I have
studied it, and I propose to Rive you briefly
the history of the crime of 1873.
The speaker traced the financial legisla
tion from 1837 to date. Continuing, he
said:
There had been no change of coinage laws
from 1837 to 1873. Up to ibis time silver was
worih more as bu lion than it was as coin.
After Bismsrcn met "Pigiron" Kellv iv Ger
muny tf you wiil watch you will pee that
there was 'a sternly growth in the protection
of Germany's indu-trie*. I say it is time that
somebody was sent to the United States who
knows what is going on instead of piling his
labor on the overworked reporters of the
daily pre-e.
Tne Republican party under the Bland-
Alli<on act coined $2,000,000 a month, and
under tho Shtrman act $4,000,000; but what
we want in order to be prosperous is a day's
work for hone.<t labor. [Applause.]
You can go to the treasury ai-d get 100
cents in gold for the silver dollar, and it is the
stxmpoftbe Government on it wi ich makes
the silver doUm, with 53 cents only, good for
100 cents. The silver dollar was au orphan at
its b.rth, without father or mother.
Suppose a s.lver-mine own r had a load of
â ilver and had 1; coined. How would you get
any of it except by wa^es? When the stÃinp
of the Government is on it it is worth 100
cent* on the dollar and it is roo.l money. I
have a le ter here irum the Dir ctor of the
Mint, stating that he can coin $40,000.00u
sliver a year, and now i<ing is it (r<>ing to t ke
you to replace the $000,000,000 you have
driven out "f tne ciini j? F fieea years.
FoÂ«d in 1873 was 4 per cc it cheaper man in
1860. Ev< rv:hing ex ept lumber was cheaper
th n in 1860. People point to the fact that
gold has appreciated but wages are lower.
Why, the Democratic pÂ«rty has beer, in power.
This shows you that every time you introduce
an unknown qu&.ai y luio the finances of the
country waives go down. This i 3 ttÂ»e result if
the currency is tampered with in th^ wrong
way. I hold that hat Â£82,000,000 deficit was
better paid in a foreign country than taken
out of the wages of this country.
In 1873 the average â¢â Hrmngs amounted to
?30'J.| In 1893 it was $485 a year .This shows
thai every worKiuuu sh red in the prosperity j
oi the Republican aocirlue ot protection. Why
chang-.- that policy? Is it not t>etter for all of i
us :o foster and support it? McKinley stands !
to-day aÂ« the apos lie of the vYorfcineman, Â«mi
he is the man iorthe workingiaan. [Applause.]
There are eight slyer States that are making j
all this silver fuss. Do any of you leliows |
think that the tail is going to wag the dog ? j
[Laughter and applause ]
We huve no State so cosely allied to the ;
doctrine of prptection as California.
All her nuts and fruits can be rased and are
raised in Europ-. I'roducts of Santa Clara!
â  County can get 6 cents a pound under the Me- ,
Kin ley bill wneu ihey could get only 3 cents j
a pound under the Mills bll. The doctrine of I
protection gives worit to thousands iv Califor- |
ilia, when otherwise they wou.d be and are :
idle. California has every climate that is
I known under the sun and all the products
which nature can give.
You enjoy in this City in the hardest times
what the laborers of Europe never see in the
I best of times. 1 have traveled over the entire
I globe. 1 never yet saw a class of men so well
clothed and housed as the mechanics of the
City of San Francisco and State of California.
Will you chan.*e all tnis because some wild
cats of the West could not gel elected on the
Democratic ticket? I tell you, what can be
done in building cruisers can be done in
every industry ot this State and under the
sun. It is possible for the people to carry our
banner around the world and command ob
servance from the banner of St. George on any
field.
Gold and silver, every dollar of it, is pledged
by the Government and redeemable in gold.
Is the poorest money the kind of a system
you want to vote for?
"No," replied tne audience.
Quoting from a speech of Daniel Web
ster in 1837, Mr. Scott said:
He who tampers with the currency robs
labor of its broad. The pr< sperity of the work
ing classes lies in an es ablished credit. Did
wild schemes and projects ever benefit the la
boring classes? Remember that such an
alarm as shuts up the banks will shut ud the
United Stales treasury as well. When you go
to your homes make up your minds to vote for

McKinley Veterans.
The Veteran Soldiers and Sailors' Re
publican Club held a largely attended
meeting at 113 Turk street on Friday and
was addressed by Wilfred M. feck of
River-ide and Thomas B. O'Brien, candi
date for Congress from the Fourth Dis
trict.
DOWN SOUTH.
Sentiment Beyond the Tehachapl
Defined by Wilfred M. Peck.
Wilfred M. Peck of Riverside, who has
been making speeches for the Republican
party in Southern California, is visiting
triends in this City. He reports the pros
pects fo r Republican success south cf the
Tenachapi as very brignt. Riverside
County is in better snape than it has ever
bf-en since its organization, as far aÂ« the
Republicans are concerned. A large num
ber of oIJ-line Democrats are outspoken
in their support of McKinley, because
they believe in sound money. They do
not wish to vote for Palmer, because they
believe that in that event their votes
would be wasted.
In Riverside County tne Republican
County Committee are making a scuool
bou-e campaign, with the result that places
that were given un for Bryan are showing
jjains for McKinley rijint along. In Los
Angeies County, outside of the city, the
Republicans i.aye been gaining for a
month past, and there is reasonable ground
for believing that Los Angeles city will go
Republican.
"It is safe to say," continued Mr. Peck,
"that south offthe Tehachapi the Republi
can party is in good shape and will fully
hold its own. The reason for Republican
gains in the south is because this is a cam
paign of education and the thinking ele
ment has been studying the financial ques
tion and they know the 50-cent dollar is
not the kind of money they are looking
for in these hard times. Republican
speakers have forced the i*sue of protec
tion, and as fruits, nuts, o.ive oil and cat
tle-raising are industries of the south the
people are beginning to appreciate that
what they need most in that part of the
country is protection for those industries
that will give immediate and sieady em
ployment to laboring men in the great
mÂ»nufactui:ng centers of the East, thus
making a market for California producte."
NOT IN POLITICS.
A Statement From the State Coun
cilor of the Junior Order of the
United American Mechanics.
The following communication is self
explanatory :
San Fkancisco, Sept. 19. 1896.
Charles M. Sh.urt.idge EÂ»q., Editor The Call,
CityâDEXR Sib: An article In the issue of
your | aper of this date headed -'A. P. A.
Ticket Put in the Field" has had the effect of
leading tne public to relieve that the Junior
Order of United American Mechanics is
represented in the convention mentioned in
tbe xrtic.e.
1 desire to correct this impression and em
phatically deny that any Councilof the Junior
Order of Un.ted American Mecnanics is repre
sented in that convention by de.egates ap
pointed by such council. On the contrary, the
councils of this Ciiy have refused to se :d
delegates for the reason that the laws and
regulat.ons prevent any subordinate counci;
sending delegates to any organization or con
vention unless the same has first had the ap
proval of the National body or the board of
officers thereof.
The following is the regulation referred to
and was adopted by the National Council at
its session in Detroit, Mich., June 23, 1893,
viz. :
"That no council be permitted to send repre
sentatives to any body or organization or asso
ciation that has not been first approved by the
board of officers of the National Council or has
the approval of this body."
Furthermore, the constitution of subordinate
councils provides, among other matters, that
subjects of a sectarian or partisan character
shall not be introduced into Â«ny meeting of
this council, nor shall any member make me
oi the name of this order at apolitical meeting.
No application has bei-n mfirie to the Ntt
tioiml council or its board ot officers by any
council of this City for the privilege of sending
delegates to the convention above mentioned.
If any member of that convention has repre
sented to the convention that certain delega:es
or any delegates nad been sent or would be
sent by the Jr. O. U. A. M. he stated something
which was untrue. Furthermore if any dele
gates presented themselves for admission on
the representation that they had been sent by
or represented the Jr. O. U. A. M. they used
tbe name of the order without authority and
were guilty of a williul misrepresentation.
Trusting that you will give this a place in
your paper, I remain, very truly yours,
H. C. SCHAERTZER,
State Councilor Jr. O. U. A. M. of California.
GERMAN-AMERICAN CLUB.
George A. Rutz Indorsed for Su-
pervisor From the Eleventh
Ward.
The German-American Republican Club
held its regular meeting on Friday at Nor
man Hall, 413 Bush street. The hall was
simply packed, not even standing room
beine available. The meeting was ad
dressed at some length by Judge Carpen
ter, W. Reinhardt on behalf of the work
ingraen, and Dr. Paulson.
The speeches were very much appre
ciated by tne club.
The enrollment committee reported 1100
new members, making in ali something
over 3000.
Tne financial committee's report was
very tavorable. After receiving othe- com
mittee reports it was resolved as follows:
Whereas, The name of George A. Rutz. one
o f our most Hdive members, has been favor
ably mentioned by the press and public for the
office of Supervisor for the Eleventh Ward at
the coming election; and, whereas, as we be
lieve that Mr. Rutz is favorably known
tiirou'hout the City as a capable business
man and a good citizen, his nomination would
be a favor and honor to this cub and all citi
zens or German birth or descent; be it,
Resolved, That this club joins in asking our
fellow-member. George A. Rutz, io beivme a
candidate for said office at the coming elec
tion, and cordially recommends him to t .c
coming munic pal convention of the Republi
can purty of this City; and be it further
Resolved, That we hereby indorse him for
said office and pledge him our hearty support,
if nominated.
Harrison Camp in Line.
The Harrison Camp Army and Navy
Republican League held a regular meeting
at bea quarters last eveivng, the attend
ance being large. Martin Murray, the
commander, called the meeting to order,
and stated that the meeting was for the
purnoÂ«e of assi-t ; ne to secure the election
of MrKiney. He said that the danger
that now threatens this country is just as
bad as in the days of '61-65.

MASSES.
friends of Protection Throng the
Town's New Wigwamâ Fireworks
and a Ball.
MOUNT EDEN, Cal., Sept. 19.â One of
the largest political meetings ever held in
this county was that at the new Mount
Eden wigwam to-day. Be- ides music by
a band, singing and speeches, there was a
barbecue of the old-fashioned kfnd in the
afternoon, concluding with a ball and fire
works at night. Farmers drove in from
all parts ot the. country to hear the
speeches.
The wigwam, a beautiful new structure
with splendid acoustic properties, was
handsomely draped with American flags,
bunting and Sowers, and the walls were
decorated with pictures of the heroes of
American history. A. W. Scbaefer, Cap
tain R. Barron, E. H. Clawiter, H. Gana
berger, F. W. Wrede ana other prominent
citizens sat on the stage.
The speakers of the afternoon were
Charles M. Shortridge, Rev. Anna Shaw
ana Congressman S. G. Hilborn, Their
speeches were brief, each discussing .he
is>ues in a different vein. The audience
consisted of the best citizens of this part
of the county, many women being present
to hear Miss Sliaw. The mention of Me-
Kiniey's name was always the signal for
great applause, and the meeting did much
to increase the ieeiiug for protection and
prosperity here.
The chairman of the evening was A. I*
Petersen, who lntroduc-d Charles M.
Stiortridge as Ihe iirst speaker. Mr. Short
ridpe said:
"Ladies and Gentlemen : Ido not know
just why it .s 1 am here, but as this beau
tiful structure is being dedicated to Re
publicanism, I feel at home in this place.
[Appiause.] I cannot account for the
presence of so many ladies, except
that that eloquent woman, Rev. Anna
Shaw, is to address you. I am glad you
are here, and I welcome you." [Cheers.]
The speaker said he came to represent
the Republican party, the principles of
which he had believed in since boyhood.
"Why? Because the Republican party
has always stood for justice and risht, as
it stands to-day. Right here I want to
say that I am in favor of woman's rights,
one of the principles of Republicanism,
though I am probably encroaching upon
Miss Shaw's grounds in reierring to it; yet
I cannot refrain from putting myaelf on
record that way once more." [Cneers.]
The speaker dwelt on the evils of direct
taxation and explained the cardinal prin
ciples of protection.
"None of you like a poll tax,' 1 he said,

'â¢and there is not a man here who would
not rather take arsenic than pay a poll
tax; yet that distineuished mugwump
and Populiatic combination headed by
Bryan favors a more obnoxious measure
than the poil tax â favora an income taxâ
which will compel every person to swear
to what he earns, and if he does not earn
It to swear to it for shame any
how. Do you want a man like
that from Nebraska to conduct the desti
nies of this country, a man who got the
nomination at Chicago by getting dyna
mite into his voice? What is his record?
Read history and you will find that Bryan
was for the infamous Gorman-Wilson tar
iff measure, which has almost bankrupted
the country. Now I want to aÃk you why
it was that the Democrats deserted their
free-trade plans all at on:e. Look into
this and see what reason there was for
their desertion. There was a time when
the people of the Kast knew nothing
about silver, bat ai! at once they made a
change. When? Why, when the coun
try as a whole turned to McKinley
[Cheers], the author of the great protec
tive measure. There was absolutely noth
ing left for the Democrats to stand upon,
and they had to turn to some new cry;
and all at once the Democratic party ran
wild, like a runaway horse, yelling for sil
ver as their salvation.
'Now I want to say it is a false issue. I
am in favor of silver now, as I have al
ways favored it, but not in favor of tne
unlimited coinage of that money without
reference to other nations. The Examiner
says I have flopped on this question; that
I "once favored silver but have now
aban loned the idea. Let me say that the
only tlrng wrong with that siory is that
it is not true. lam for silver row, as I
Lave always favored it, but I am in favor
of a protective tariff and of sou: d money.' '
The speaker dwelt at some length upon
the failures of the Democratic party,
Bhowing how it took hold of the Govern
ment wlien there was a full treasury and
then practically bankrupted it. He com
plimented Cleveland on one thing, how
ever â his record in preventing violence in
Chicago and elsewhere by calling for Gen
eral Miles to stop all nonsense.
"Though a Republican," he continued,
"I am for my country and 'or the perpetu
ity of its institutions. I believe in doing
all we can for our country's greatness and
glory. With this belief I commend you to
McKinley, the peerless statesman and pa
triot. He who fought for unity and
strength in the past is for the protection
of the toiler at home as against the toiler
abroad to-day. He is for honest money,
for protection and prosperity. He opposes
class distinctions, and has done more
than all the Democrats combined to breuk
down sectionalism. In his mind there is
no North or South, and in his mental
horizon there is no Mason and Dixon's line.
Come with us under the banner of Repub
licanism, which means the welfare of the
whole people iorevermore."
The speaker was loudly applauded.
"The Star-spangled Banner" was feelingly
sung by Miss Roxey Dennis.
The next speaker was Rev. Anna Shaw,
who spoke briefly on the woman's rights
part ot the Republican plauorm, sayme:
"1 think this is even more important than
tie tariff or than gold and silver. Women
are taking great interest in politics every
where. Women are not taking an interest
in politics now because one candidate is
handsome, for both are handsome, both
are honorable, both are pure men and
good husbands. The women are corning
out because tbey are interested in poiit.es.
They know nearly as much about 16 to 1
as the men do, though they have as yet
had little opportunity to handle either
gold or silver. [Laughter.] I want to say
that there is no question of government
that concerns women less than men. If
one policy or the other is to make this
country prosper, that fact surely must
interest women as much as men, for their
homes and their liberties are affected as
much by great government changes as are
the homes and liberties of their husbands,
eons and fathers. [Applause.]
''The Republicans bravely voted for
woman's suffrage and thereby declared
their adherence to the fundamental prin*
ciples of republican government, in the
history of the triumphs of woman's rights
you will find the record of the Republican
party a glorious one. But lam not a Re
publican nor a Democrat nor a Populist
nor a Prohibitionist. I do not know
enough to be a Republican, I am not good
enough to be a Democrat, I have not suf
fered enough to be a Populist an<i lam
not sober enough to be a Prohibitionist.'
But if I wanted to be either I could not be
under your laws. Any kind of a man or
no kind of a man can be.ong to any party
he wants to, but a woman is for
ever barred. Why is it that you
men class us women on a political
basis with Chinese? Is it because we are
both long-haired? Are you not ashamed
to class women with idiots, lunatics and
Chinese? How would you like to be
classed that way? Wouldn't you resent
it, and don't you believe that your own
wives and daughters ought to be given a
chance to vote? WeoHen near that women
don't want to vote. That reminds me of
tne little Swede woman in South Dakota
who tod me when I complained that her
countrywomen did not want to vote that
I made a mistake in asking them their de
sires at the table. She said, 'Wait until
the husband is in the field and men they
all want to vote.'
"I am for your Republican platform, be
cause it stands for a Government of the
people, by the people and for the people,
and because it has taken the stand that
blazes the way for human rights ana glory
beyond."
The Bpeaker was enthusiastically ap
plauded. Her remarks were followed by
a song by W. E. Rowland entitled "Tell
Bryan That You Saw Me," which resulted
iii an enthusiastic recalL
The next speaker was Hon. S. G. Hil
born, who said in substance:
"I am pleased, indeed, to meet you here,
for, though I have been in this county a
long time, I do not remember to have ever
bpi.ken here before.
â¢'After considerable traveling all over
America I can say that this spot where
we now stand is one of the grandest on
earth.
"I do not care to make much of a
speech, for I am following one of the best
speakers 1 ever heard. [Applause.]
"Wben I went to "Washington I met
three remarkable men," continued the
speaker, "McKinley, Bryan and Watson â
all orators and all noble types of man
hood â all men of high personal character.
At St. Louis I heard a woman pay a high
tribute to McKinley, whom she called the
best husband in America. Day after day
and night aiter nignt he is* by the bedside
of bis invalid wife, never slighting her for
a moment. If the ladies could vote they
might vote for him, but Bryan is hand
some and eloquent.
"But beyond this let me say that wher
ever woman suffrage has been tried it has
been a success. Let me say that women
are to-day a big factor in politics in Wash
ington. It is recognized that the home
life of Congressmen has a great influence
on the Nation."
Mr. Hilborn said that the election of
Grover Cleveland was a mistake.
"It haÂ«i cost this country more than all
its wars. \Vhen Cleveland got back from
a duck hunt in North Carolina about two
years ago he discovered that our gold
was flowing out of the country and he
begged us to remain and repair the evil.
The Republican House tried to get through
a tariff law, but Democracy was iv the
way.
"And let me tell you that McKinley's
name to-day stands for protection to
American labor, and that is the real issue
of this campaign."
The speaker said the last Republican
Congress built battle-ships, improved har
bors and diti great and good work for the
general welfare of tbe people. Coining to
the funding bill he committed himself
firmly against extending the time of pay
ing tie debts which the Pacific roads owed
the Government. He said he objected to
borrowing money at 3}Â£ per cent and lend
ing it to the roads at 2 per cent.
"I voted against those unholy funding
bill schemes. Did I do ri ht? [A voice,
"Yes."] Then if you helieve I <iid right I
want you to vote for me. On silver, I
stand for international bimetallism.
There is no more siiver in the world than
We need and no more gold than we need.
All the groat cations are for both metals
and I believe the goal car. be reached by
proper, sober action. [Applause.]
'â¢You know full well that the Demo
cratic administration has been a failure.
You know that the day Cleveland took
charge there were more men at work in
this country than ever before and you
know ruin and disgrace follow Demo
cracy.
"This Nation is getting deeper and
deeper in debt under Democracy, while
under Republicanism we have steadily re
duced the debts mouth by month."
At the conclusion ot this speech the
audience dispersed to partake of the roast
ox and many delicacies prepared at the
barbecue. At night there was a ball and
the festivities ended with fireworks.
SONS OF THE REVOLUTION
They Banquet at the" California
Hotel in Commemoration of
the Country's Father.
A. S. Hubbard, the Organizer of the
Association, Occupies the S?at
of Honor.
The Sons of the American Revolution
pave a grand banquet at the California
Hotel last night in commemoration of
George Washington's farewell address to
the Nation founded by him and the brave
men who assisted him on the occasion of
his declination to accept a third term in
the Presidential chair.
The California Society of the Sons of the
American Revolution was organized in
San Francisco in 1876. the centennial year
of our anniversary, at which time about
a dozen oi those whose forefathers
COLONEL A. S. HUBBARD, the Founder of the California Society
of the Sons of the American Revolution on the 4th of July, J876.
fought in the Revolutionary War held a i
meeting and organized a platoon of
soldiers in continental dress who paraded
in the procession on the Fourth of July of
that year.
This small beginning was the patriotic
incentive to A. S. Hubbard, wno at a later ;
date compiled all data, and by indom
itable energy and determination remained
faithful to the work until his loyalty was
rewarded by a seat of honor at yesterday's
banquet.
The gathering last night was a grand
affair and did honor to the sons of the
grand men who fought that a nation of
free men might live.
Hon. Horace Davis delivered an address
on tvÂ« events recalled by the anniversary.
Edward P. Cole spoke on Virginia, tne
State where Washington was born. Rev.
E. J. Dupuy gave a brief history of the
allied armies of the Revolution.
The "American Soldier" was the subject
upon which C. A. Sumner dwelt at con
siderable length.
General W. H. L. Barnes, in his usual
eloquent manner, held his associates as
close listeners to his review of the days of
Washington and his army.
A. S. Hubbard gave a brief history of
the organization of the society in San
Francisco.
In response to the toast, "The Spirit of
the Times," William M. Bunker said:
If a few simple words will serve you, they
are yours. 1 cannot brighten such a brilliant
occasion, I cannot match the masterly
speeches we have heard, I cannot swell the
importance of the hour or add another laurel !
to the wreath, but lean felicitate the people
on the potential patriotism of your presence.
Truly, the good men do lives after them.
In fancy I see our revolutionary ancestors
around this festive board.
The gentlemen In wigs are in varying moods,
some lively and some gay, some stern of !
aspect and looking like their pictures, but '
noisy or silent, merry or morose, they are ail
patriots, al brave and true, and for the sake I
of the cause and that the varnish of history
may. be unstained we will not try to hear what
tney are saying. Ii family traditions be trust
worthy some of the stories are ungloved and
of Bohemian flavor, and judging by the noise
in yon merry group one wigged patriot has
just told a story more juicy than genteel. j
But let that pass. There are no reporters
present, and the wife oi the story-teller, one
of the dear old revolutionary foremothers,
was doubtless none the wiser for the spicy
yarn and never knew what she had missed. 'â 
Ah I those old boys of blessed memory knew
a good thing when they met it, were the bet
ter for having met it, and no matter who like*
it or dislikes it, we, descendants of those illus
trious sires, will hold true to their memory
and fight for their principles. They made a
record of which all liberty-lovers are proud, ,
and If we can help it they shall never be de
nied their meed of praise.
Since when has it been a crime to honor pa
triots and patriotism? I ask this question be
cause there are those to-day who, through
jealousy or an equal petty motive, never lo.e
a chance to sneer at a society like oursâ so
ciety lormed to perpetuate the principles of
llterty and pay tribute to patriots.
Out of the alembic of time a new and fresh
freedom will appear, the ideal freedom of our
forefathers, a freedom that will stand the '
crucial test of social and political strain, a
freedom that will place poverty and riches on
the same plane . and do justice to modest
merit. And when that time comes the de
vitalizing influence of aggressive wealth will
be a thine of the past and our country will re
turn to first principles. Then the Nation will
be poulticed with common sense and its
troubles healed. Let us cherish the hone that
the . progress of the republic will not.be in
dream or shadow, but stand out in cameo dis
tinctness, and that divine wisdom will move
its people by a common impulse to grand and
patriotic exertion. . .

BROTHERS IN ART.
Keith, Bruce Porter, Willis Polk and
Douglas Tiiden Will Fool
Ideas.
William Keith, Bruce Porter, Willis
Polk and Douglas Tiiden have' banded
themselves into a union to pool their ideas
on the subject of art. It was Willis Polk's
idea in the first instance, that the arts of
architecture, sculpture, mural decoration
and painting should not go straying along
different paths, but should all be fused
into one harmonious, whole, and his
friends entered heartily into the idea.
"The old Italian artists combined ar
chitecture with sculpture and paintine,''.
said Willis Polk, enthusiastically. "Mich
ael Angeio did not design buildings with
out any regard to the statues that were to
ornament them, or the paintings that
were to go on the walls. The arts were
combined, and that is just what we want
to doâ blend the arts into one." * â 
Douglas Tiiden said that he approved
heartily of the idea, but that be had not
given much thought to how it was to be
put into execution. "We want to try to
work in unison," he said. "If any place
is to be built all the arts should be repre
sented in it. The idea is not to go as far
as a business partnershipâ we are to pool
our ideas, that is all. We can meet and
I talk and suggest when there is any build-
ing about to be erected; that is as far as
our plans have gone at present."
Bruce Porter laughed at the lidea of
there being any business partnership.
"Artists and sculptors here take the
crumb" that fall from the tables of the
rich. There is not enough eoing on to
justify them in forming a commercial ar
rangement. Ours is simply a sympathetic
relationship between men pertaining to
the arts, to bring closer together archi
tecture, sculpture, mural decoration and
painting. It could not be applied prac
tically, except in the case of important
buildings, but we hope to influence stu
dents.
"If you want an example of the effect
of severing the arts, there Is always the
beautiful and noble example of the City
Hall, where the architecture, sculpture
and mural decoration are ail diverse and
all bad. Results like that always ensue
when the general arrangement is left in
the hands of laymen. When the Pbelan
monumen is put outside Native Sons'
Hall, people will see an example of 'the
harmonious results achieved by the archi
tect and sculp.or working together in
sympathy and unison."

IT WAS A FALSE ALARM.

Last night at the Orpheum Theater
there was a narrow escape from a serious
panic. Nobody was injured, though hun

The usual Saturday night audience
packed the house. Early in the evening,
about 9:30 o'clock, the electric wires be

apparatus and caused some confusion
behind the scenes "out of sight," causing
brilliant sparka to fly around.
Staid Stage Manager Holden, deeming
"discretion the better Dart of valor," rang
down the curtain.
"When the curtain dropped a young man
in the front row, with a suspicion born of
long attendance on vaudeville, divined
that something was wrong.
He rose and ran down the aisle for the
main entrance He was followed by
others. They even rushed down from the
gallery. In a few seconds there was a
crowd of several hundred people at the
main entrance struegling for exit.
Meanwhile "the band played on," and
a serious panic and stampede of the house
was averted.
When the doorkeeper saw that the
crowd wanted to get out he opened the
broad doors and let them flock into the

HARDWOOD PAVEMENTS.

The regular meeting of the directors of

mann. James S. Con well, "W. D. Doane, A.
Fusenot, Huso D. Keil, Henry Michaels,
M. A. Rothchild, Vanderlynu Stow and
Frank A. Swain.
Colonel George W. 8011, United States
Consul at Sydney, N. S.W., submitted to
the board the experience of the city of
Sydney in using wood blocks for the
paving of that city. He submitted samples
of the wood there used. It is a species of
very nard eucalyptus that is grown in
Australia. One of the samples was a block
that had been down on a street that was
the heaviest traveled for ever twelve years,
and the wear was oniy 1-10 of an iijch in
that period. He reported that the experi
ence with this wood in Sydney was so
satisfactory that the city had abandoned
every other form of pavement, and is now
using wood only. He claimed that wood
could be sent in large sizes to the United
States, where it could be cut in the proper
sized blocks and used for pavina at a cost
not exceeding that of the best materiuis
thai are now In use here. In case the City
of San Francisco desireJ to experiment
with this wood pavement, Colonel Bell
agreed to get the concession from the
Australian Government to have tbe wood
sent to the United States lor that purpose.
The board decided to refer the entire
matter to the consulting engineer with
instructions that the subject be thoroughly
investigated and that a thorough researcu
be made throughout California for the
purpose of ascertaining whether this spe
cies of eucalyptus was not also grown
within our borders, California being famous
for its many varieties of eucalyptus. The
directors thought it advisable to ascertain
whether this species of wood was not al
ready grown in this State, and whether
it could not be raised here. The objection
to wood as a pavement arising from the
unfortunate experience of the City with
Nicholson's pavement in former years was
shown in no way to apply to this new
wood pavement.
An official communication was received
from the Board of Health containing a
memorial addressed to the Merchants'
Association. The memorial contained the
report of Dr. John C. Spencer, bacteriolo
gist of the board, and stated that tuber
culosis or consumption was largely the
result of the inhalation of dust that had
dried germs of tuberculosis contained in
the expectorations of those afflicted with
the disease. The memorial claimed that
by lightly sprinkling the surface of the
streets this dust would be kept In a moiit
condition and would therefore not be dan
gerous. The danger from this dust is in
its pulverized ury condition and by
lightly sprinkling the streets the dust
can be kept down. Tne memorial recom
mended the light sprinkling of surfaces
about to be swept and that wagons con
taining sweepings be covered.
The directors of tbe association decided
to thank the Board of Health for the
memorial and instructed the secretary to
forward the same to the Board of Super
visors with the request that the recom
mendations be executed by the Board of
Supervisors as soon as possible.
The following applications for member
ship were received and the parties were
unanimously elected members of tne as
sociation: M. J. Brandenstein & Co., Owen
& Starr, Hermann Safe Company, H. Eb

BRYAN AS A DEMAGOGUE.
The Boy Orator as Seen by a
Neighbor.
Daniel Powell, a well-known citizen of
Reno, Nev., recently got a very interest
ing letter from his nephew, Judge CM.
Palmer of Lincoln, Neb., one of Bryan's
friends and neighbors. It sheds much
liguton the boy orator's character and,
shows that he is a demagogue. Among
other things the writer says:
Now as for Mr. Bryan, he is a neighbor of ,
mine and has been for many years. His office !
is in the same building, not thirty leet from
mine, I have frequently tried cases with him. |
He and his family belong to the same church
as I and my family. Mr. Bryan is in every '
sense an honorable, pleasant gentleman, a good
citizen Rnd a fair lawyer. As a man I have the
proiouniiest respect for him.
But it is politically that we are considering
him now. He is strictly a politician; bis
whole life has been devoted to politics; his law
practice is a geco id consideration.
His ambition is for political notoriety, and
so fur he has made his way by his brilliant ora
tory. As an orator he has no superiors and i
thit.k few equals; he is simply irresistible; he
carries an audieuce by storm; people will ap- i
plaud his bursts of oratory, but after the ex
dtement is over they will wonder at the man
ner in which they have seemingly lost their
heail9.
Mr. Bryan is simply an ndventurer in pub- !
lie; he is always scheming for tome nuw !
dodge, some wild-eyed scheme to catch new i
voters and the discontented, disappointed ed- |
venturers like himself; he is always playing i
upon the people's imaginary grievances, aim- !
ing to inflame their prejudices against those i
who are more contented and more successful
than they.
The Dehaes, the Coxejn and the strikers are
sure to tind an advocate in him. Four years
aj;o he was an ardent free-trader; he draw
tears from the eyes of his hearers by painting
the woes coming from a protective tariff ; he
pledged them ail sorts of relief lrom free trade,
etc. But having partially succe>ded is de
stroying some of our most important indus
tries, chief among which is the utter ruin of
our sheep and wool tiade, he views the ruin
he has helped to bring upon the people with
perfect comp.acency. He even laughs at it,
but makes no effort at defending their in
famous fraud upon the people. He now
strikes a new note on a higher key ; it is ''free
silver" now, and with many plau?ibie speeches
he seeks to again deceive and gull tne dear i
people, and. strange to say, he is succeeding in |
mitny localities.
Immediately after his nomination he cre
ated quite a furor here. There wns quite a
Bryan vavo swept over the country, but it was j
largely on account of State prido and Bryan's i
local popularity, but it has very largely 'sub- ;
sided now, and the sober second thought of :
the people has already asserted itself, and to I
my personal knowledge the Republican party
is steadily gaining strength every day.
â¢ â¢â¢â¢â¢*
Again, thinking people who know Mr. Bryan
know tiim to be a young man only 36 years
of age, with no experience, no knowledge of j
the science of government, with no realizing '
sense of the importance of the place he is seek- j
lug, with, in fact, nothing to back him save I
his wonderful oratory, and they are alrendy !
asking of what account will his oratory be to
the Nation if he is by chai.ee made President.
They know him to be a man of inordinate
ambition; that he truckles to every element,
DO matter how dangerous it may be, for sup
port. They know he seeks to advance his own
political fortunes, at all hazÂ»rds>, and if that i
be nece.'sary the welfare or the Nation would
be sacrificed to his greedy ambition.
Mr. BryÃn teaches that kind of political
treason that makes the poor man hate the ',
rich man, no matter though the rich man may :
furnish him employment with which to sup- !
Eort his family; it Is a doctrine oi hate â to i
ate everybody and everything above you in .
the financial, social or political world. The i
man who is better off than you in the world is,
by Pryan, held up to desecration as the man
responsible for all your woes, and straqee to
say in the very lowest Classes it is a catching i
doctrine.
Again, he teaches that all government is i
tyrannical. Policemen, State militia and es- !
pi-dally United States troops are kept up sim- i
ply to oppress and persecute the adherents of ;
his scheme. The lower down and more law- '
breaking classes are only too glad to find a
champion in him. He champions every wild
pyed, visionary fad that he thinks may help
him to swim to political fame.
I am quite confident that McKinley will be
overwhelmingly elected. I am sue he will
carry Bryau's ward, Bryan's city, Bryan's ;
county, Bryan'* Congressional district, ani I I
Â«m quite confident he will carry Bryan's State,
though the Pops and Democrats have fused in
this Slate, which with some few soit-headed
silver Republicans, will make us a hard tight,
hut we are going to put up the fight of our ;
lives.
DEMOCRATS AND FUSION.
The State Central Committee For-
mally Ratifies the Unholy
Daal.
The Democratic State Central Commit
tee held a special meeting in the billiard
room of the California Hotel yesterday to
ratify the fusion ticket of electors and Con
gressmen which the politicians in control
had engineered through the mess of fusion
special committees which had been at the
front for several weeks.
This ratification by tbe State Central
Committee was simply a measure decided
on through an excess of caution, and the
action was simply formal and perfunctory.
Not twenty members of tbe committee
were present when Chairman Alford and
Secretary McCabe began to engineer the
format proceedings.
A lesolution offered by W. J. Brobeck
was adopted, and thereby the operation of
naming four Populist electors in the place
of the four Democratic electors who had
resigned was repeated formally by the
highest party authority which at the time
could express itself.
In the resolution C. A. Barlow, the Pop
ulist nominee of the Sixth District, was
named to supply the vacancy caused by
resignation of W. S. Patton, the one Dem
ocrat whose resignation was secured dur
ing tne fusion negotiations.
Mr. Brobeck. also introduced a success
ful resolution concerning that $30 assess
ment levied on the members of the State
Central Committee at the last meeting.
Seven of tbe huudred and some
committeemen had paid the as
sessment and d rustic measures ap
peared to be necessary. Mr. Brobeck's
resolution declared that failure to pay tbe
assessment should be sufficient grounds
for removal of delinquents, and further,
that delinquents shall be removed if the
assessments are not paid by October 3.
There wa9 also adopted a resolution by
J. W. Alitchell of Los Angeles faVoring
campaign meetings at an early oate in the
principal towns and cities of the State un
der tl.e joint auspices of the Democratic,
Populist and silver parties.
Another resolution offered by R. B.

bers of the State Central Committee and
the various county committees be in

GLADSTONE'S VIGORGTT3 POLICY.
Wil Advocate the Immediate Severing
of Diplomatic Relations With
the Sultan.
LONDON, Esq., Sept. 19.â England has
been facing for a week what on all sides is
described as imminent danger of war, and
on the whole she is not as sure as she was
last week that she likes ii. Then the most
interesting feature of the situation was the
fact that the Tories were helping to work
up an Armenian agitation; now the ran*t
significant thing is that they are turning
round and almost tearfully deprecating it.
I get from a source which I respect a hint
that this change has been influenced by a
message sent through roya! channels from
the Danish court that the Czar was best to
be handled some other way.
It is on this question, bear in mind, of
how far the Czar can be handled at all at
Bernsdorff and Ba.morai tbat the situation
now most largely turns. Upon the effort
to bring him into sympathy w^th the
English point of view as much energy as
was deemed safe has been expended inside
the Danish royal family. It was at Copen-
hagen alone in Europe that the late Czar
used to hear the truth, but Ue was an un
known mas to tell truth to, and when he
did not suik in solitude for days there
after he had an unpleasant way of split
ting a table with his giant fist as a token
that he had beard enough.
His successor is wholly unlike the
father, so far as externals go, but how
amenable he is to influence no one knows.
By some accounts he is of a gentle and
amiable temperament j others say tbat he is
a taci- urn, suspicious egoist, witd the obsti
nacy of a ruule. Howev- r tnat may be,
bis Danish and English relatives will have
baa a month in which to do what they
cr.n with him.
Russia's notification to the powers made
in August of last year tnat she w uld re
sist any attempt on the part of any power
to intervene on its own account in Tur
key still formally blocKs tbe war. Priuce
Lobanoff leattirmed that position in
Vienna, and on the strength of this the
Austro-German decision to go witb Russia
was made absolute. Apparently Loban
off' s spectacular disappearance from the
scene did noi alter Poissa' 8 attitude, as it
was reaffirmed again at Breslau. Botti
the German aud Austro-Hunsrarian papers
oi the inspired sort have been conducting
a campaign of bluster against England
all the year, but tbeir truculence was
never so marked and confident as in the
past week or two. The same class of Rus
sian journals, too, now talk with more
assurance than ever before about a league
of all Europe against England.
So far, therefore, as diplomatic records
go. England continuas to be confronted
by Russia's threat of war. If she ven
tures io take independent action in pro
tecting the Armenians and ignoring the
fact that nominally, at least, the concert
of Europe stands behind Russia, and butts
her head suraigh against this wall, it may
be magnificent, hut it will not be wbat
England upon reflection is at all likely to
do. There may be ways of weakening the
wall or of turning past it. Lord Salisbury
has been toiling all tt.e year to detach
somebody from this European concert. It
is generally understood, both here ai:d
abroad, that Italy is mo^e or iess commit
ted to England's assistance, but this by
itself is not good enouah. France is
visibly feeling the effects of the humanita
rian upheaval in England, and her papers
do not revile the British agitation as do
those of Berlin and Vienna, but diplomat
ically France is in the Czar's pocket.
There remains then the possibility ot
winning over the Czar himself.
There is also another alternative which
one day seems very remote and the next
advances into tbe foreground. This is the
fact that England may discover sufficient
reasons for believing ihat in case she took
a bold course the old rivalries and jealous
ies of her existing on the continent would
really paralyze action against her. It iÂ«
of cour;?e, a huge risk to run, but En land
has trusted before now to the chance that
Europe would remain motionless in the
face of a fait accompli. She did it when
she bombarded Alexandria, and she came
off then with safety. Adventurous spirits
are urging Lord Salisbury to take this
chance acain, and laÂ«t week, as was said,
it loofct-d as if he had nerved himself to do
it, but this week it ooks different.
Little is said about a matter whic may
easily have a very significant bearing on
this pha>e o: the outlook. Germany and
Russia have be^un what practically
amounts to a revivai of their old customs
war. The ratification oi a Russo-Ger
man commercial treaty in 1893 was really
the foundation on which the political rap
prochement between Berlin and St. Pe
tersburg vi as reared.
In his recent retro rade course, how
ever, Emperor William has tried to curry
fÂ«vor with the Agrarian nobility o* East
Prussia by allowing officials to interpret
this treaty io tbe detriment of Russian
food products. Russia, after a vain re
monstrance, has retaliated by trebling the
duty on Germen ieatner poods, snd it is
expected that in a few weeks the whole
fabric of the treaty will be in ruins. The
Berlin official press has already got to the
point of threatening that the Reuhsbank
will be again forbidden to deal in Russian
securities. All this is rather striking proof
in favor of tbe contention that the Euro
pean concert is really a name ratner than
a fact, and ihat it is ready to fall to pieces
at a resolute toucb.
A? another hypothetical wav out of this
slough of world disgrace, it must be said
that the English abandon with profound
disHppointment the r transient hope hat
America m e.:t join them in a holy cru
sade. An was pointed out last week, this
was at best a ratner trn.d and despairing
hope.

reported expressions of American opinion
have roughly dashed tnis hope again.
Precisely why we could wage war upon

powers w re buying immunity from th< m

not like to have to explain to wondering

who has taken this notion of American

some reflection of this idea was what the

BERLIN. Germany, Sept. 19.â The ex
cited language emnlovcd by the Vienna
and Berlin semi-official newspapers in
discussing the Turkisn policy adopted by
Lord Salisbury is known to be due to the
rat-idly growing divergence of the lines of
Lord Salisbury's proposal and that of
Count Goluchowski, tbe Austrian Minister
of Foreign Affairs, as to how to deal with
the 8 ltan. Prince Hobeniohe, the Ger
man Imperial Chancellor, who has now
gone to hiH estate at Altau*Bee in Syria for
a season of chamois hunting, has contin
ued to play second fiddle to Count G"lu
c owski since that Â»tatesmnn took the in
itiative upon the Eastern question. To
tbe Berlin Government the question re
mains viewad as affecting the Dreibnnd
chiefly.
The semi-official press here naturally
follow the lead of Vienna semi-official or
gans, but it is difficult in the extreme to
ascertain what Count Goluchowstki's views
are beyond, for the present at least, up
holding the Sultan and maintaining the
states q:>-> la Turkey generally.
Amid the newspaper invectives which
have been hurled against England not a
single suggestion of reform* on the part
of the Porte has appeared. AuÂ«trta ob
viously fears that the action ol E tgl: nd
wilt drive the Sultan to cl3im tl.e protec
tion of Ru-f ia. involving the sudden ap
pearance of Russian troops at Constanti
nople and Ru sian warships in the Dar
dinel.es
0 itsidc of the semi- fficial press the
consensus oi opinion is that tbe Bultan
must be. deposed before the recurring dis
orders in Constantinople and elsewhere in
tbe Turkish empire shall case, bit the
opinion in Foreign Otlii-e circles nere is
that time ruust be allowed in which to
enab c the powers to arrange ior tbe selec
tion and enthronement of his successor.
Tbe Vienne Neve Frie Preiae ritrntly

FOR SOUND MONEY
AND PROTECTION
Ten Thousand Voters Call
at Canton and Cheer
McKinley.
RAILROADERS IN LINE.
From Chicago They Journey to
the Home of the Next
President
RECEIVE A EOYAL WELCOME.
The Major Tells Why Men of All
Classes J un the Battle Against
Repudiation.
CANTON, Ohio. Sept. 19.â AH day long
the tramp of visiting delegations was
heard in Canton, and all day long Major
McKinley was able to say, "How beauti
iul upon the mountains are the ieet of
him that bringeth eood tidings,' 1 for 10,000
â voters called to greet him and to cheer
him and to promise him tneir support.
The greatest delegation oÂ» the day and
of the campaign was that of the railway
men. There were nearly 5000 in the dele
gation. They came on ten special trains
and traveled all night in common day
coachts in order to see Major McKinley.
They were all workingmen â railway em
ployes â and there were no officials among
them. They marched up the streets in
splendid order, with their own bands. It
was a stirring labor demonstration and
the spectators on the streets were liberal
in demonstrations of delight Major Mc-
Kiniey was impressed with the great out
pouring of Chicago railway employes, and
he made them a long speech notwith
standing the iact that he bad to stand in
the rain to do it. With the railway men
was a fine delegation of commercial teleg
raphers,, nearly 200 in number. M. J.
Burice was their spokesman.
J. W. Dodge spoka for the railway men.
In response to these warmly applauded
addresses, Major McKinley said:
My fellow-citizens: It would be a hard
heart, indeed, which would not be moved by
this splendid demonstration. Ibid you each
end every one of you a sincere welcome to my
home. I count it among ihe greatest, honors
ot my life to have 5000 representative men of
the creat railroad lines of the country center
in? in Chicago come to this city to give me
their assurances that in the year 1896 they
stand by protection, reciprocity and sound
money. [Great applause.] These delegations,
coming long distances, present a remarkable
phase in our political life and evidence the
deep solicitude they have fcr the welfare of
our country. Such a demonstration as this
would not be possible if the people of the
country were not profoundly sensible of the
dangerous menace which is presented in the
National contest of this year. [Applause and
cries of "We are all interested."]
You are here to-day, men of all parties and
creeds, because you want to defeat the effort
which is now being assiduously made to de
stroy the credit and currency of the country
and al6o because loving law and order you
want to stamp out the spirit of lawlessness and
repudiation which now threaten it. [Applause
and cries of "That's what we will do."]
Your active interest in this contest for good
government, good morals and good money will
be helpful in every part of the country and in
spiring to Ihe friends of good government
everywhere. The railway is the miÃhtiest fac
tor of modern civilization. If one proof above
any other be asked for the superiority of the
United States above any other country of
equal or approaching territory, I know of no
better eviaence than the fact that of the
4127,000 miles of railroad in the world we have
nearly 200,000 miles in this great Republic.
[Applause and cries of "Good."]
To trace their history during the past
twenty years would be to write the progress of
the country itself, 60 intimately are they
associated. To say they have cost $9,000,
-000,000, employ 1,000,000 men, with 30,000
locomotives, 27,000 passenger cars and over
1,100,000 other cars; that their capital stock
is $4,640,000,000, with funded debts of
$4.800.000.000, yeariy traffic earnings of
$1,000,000,000, net earnings of $3 18,000,000
and dividends of $84,000,000 annually, con
veys but a faint idea 01 how fully they enter
into every line of business and affect directly
or indirectly the great masses of our people.
Not only are lives constantly in their keeping,
but every year they become more and more
essential to our subsistence, convenience and
comfort. [Applause.]
Tie greatest tribute which can be paid to
the railroad men of the country is that high
degree of care and attention and skill which
they give to the service, perfecting the most
delicate and responsible duties engaged In a
business in which life and property are in
volved, where heedlessness or carelessness
will sacrifice either or both; and yet the per
centage of loss is merely nominal In both
case;-. Not only is skill and endurance re
quired in their exacting duties, but the great
est watchfulness aud fidelity, more often the
keenest intelligence to think and act instantly
under circumstances the most perilous and
trying. [Applause and cries of "That's right,
Major."]
I have said that railroad men are cool and
collected, brave and vigilant in the discbarge
of their duties. [Great applause andcriesof
"Hurrah for McKinley."] And surely greater
praife could not be given them than this.
â¢'Failhful unto death" has been truly written
of many a brave engineer, conductor or brake
wan who perished rather than abandon his
train when thm was possible, at the expersÂ«e
of others. [Great applause and cries of "That's
right."]
Bo worthy are these devoted servants of the
people, bo watchful, that railroad accidents
are said by competent authority to be neither
as frequent nor as fatal as other modes of trans
portation. Your spokesman has justly ob
served lhat no body of Americans have greater
interests at stake in the pending political cam
paign thun the railroad men, who are every
where taking tbe liveliest interest in the proper
settlement of the great principles Involved in
It. [Applause.] The triumph of free silver
would mean to you, as the adoption by Mexico
has meant to the railway employes of tiiat
country, a decrease in the purchasing power of
tbe money in which they aro paid fully one
half, with comparatively no increase in wages.
[Cries of "We don't want it and we will not
have it"] Not only that, but It would mean
inevitably decreased employment and distress.
The 50-cent-dollar employes of the railroads
will no more add to y<> ur salaries than the rail
roads wouid add to their income by decreasing
the sire of their cars. [Great cheering.]
The railway men are deeply interested in
the prosperity of the country. [Cries of "You
bet we are."] They know from experience
that when the country is prosperous railroads
are prosperous [cries of "Yes, we do"] aud
When railroads are prosoerous they have
steady work and remunerative employment.
[Applause]
They know when the business of the coun
try is poor the business of railroads is poor
aud the employes suffer both in time and pay.
[Cries of "That' 6 right, major."] Tney are
Interested, too. in good money [cheers] aud
they are in favor of law and order. [Great
applause and cries of "Yes, yes; hurrah for
McKlnley."] They warn to perpetuate our
free institutions for their children, forever
and foreveriDore. [Tremendous cheering.]
They are zealous, like all stood citizens, for the
honor of the country [cries of "We are"] and
they mean to maintain unsullied the proud
name of America. [Great cheering.]
They do not believe in either public or pri
vate dishonesty. [Aplause and cries of "No,
no."] They want the Government to pay its
debss in the best currency known to the com
mercial world. [Applause and cries of "That's
right."] And they want the railways to pay
tiiem in the best currency of the world. [Great
cheering and cries of "Hurrah for McKmley."]
Currency that will not be questioned and that
will page current everywhere on its face value
without discount or depreciation. [Renewed
cheering and cries of "That's what we want."]
I cannot conceive of a more potential force
in our politics this year than the men who trav
erse this country lrom one end of it to the
other, and to feel that a large percentage of
that force is enlisted in theKepublicancau.se
and is fighting for the success of the Republi
can principles is an assurance of victory which
will gladden every patriotic heart. [Great ap
plause.]
You are always solicitous for the trains in
your charge; you guard them with sleepless
activity from wrecks and wreckers, and as
citizens of this glorious republic you are
deeply concerned in its progress and nonor,
and will guard with equal oare from wreck the
credit and currency and courts of the United
States. [Great applause and cries of "We
will.' ] The signals of danger to public safety
and honor are as quickly, as faithfully heeded
by you as are the danger signals the roads
have established for the safety of life and
property committed to your care. [Cheering.]
The perils which lie along the path of the Na
tion's progress you would heip to remove as
you would remove tnose along the track of the
mighty railroads you operate. I welcome the
railroad employes of this country as allies in
the great contest for the country's honor and
the country's flag. [Applause.]
The contest this year, my countrymen, if it
results in a victory for the Republican party
will not be a mere party victory, but a victory
deeper and broader and more significant than
that, for it will represent the votes of men of
all parties, who unite with the Republican
party in the patriotic purpose to preserve the
honor of the country. [Applause and cries of
"You are right."]
With the many delegations that are visiting
me to-day, the one crowding the other, I am
sure you will excuse me from talking at
greater length, as I would be glad to do to this
splendid audience of earnest and patriotic
men. I thank yon, one and all, for this visit.
It has been an inspiration to me, and I believe
that it will be of invaluable servica to the
cause in which we are all engaged. [Great
applause.]
And now, Mr. Burke and gentlemen of the
Telegraphers' Association of Chicago, I am
glad to greet you here with the railroad em
ployes, who have honored me with the;r
presence. [Applause.] Perhaps none of us ap
preciate tne degree of universal acceptance
that the telegraph has obtained.
I remember as a boy of reading how Morse,
the first to put the telegraph into practichl use
in the United fatates, sent his first greeting
across the wiresâ the significant message,
"What bath God wrought!"' Little did the
people know then what a. gift he had made to
his future countrymen and to the remotest
ages. [Applause.] When the Democratic Na
tional Convention in 1844 was in session at
Baltimore it is said the news of Mr. Poik's
nomination was instantly telegraphed to
Washington, sixty miles distant; but it found
no credence there. Men did not believe in the
accuracy of the statement and waited untii it
was vended by the newspapers or the return
ing delegates. [Laughter and applause.] Per
haps the news was surprising where a differ
ent result was so confidently expected, but it
illustrates the credulity of the times and the
lack of confidence in scientific accuracy. Con
trast this lack of faith with the story of the
old man who, it is reported, had learned to
read the ticking of the wires, waited patiently
at the telegraph office in Chicago for many
hours for news irom Washington that Lee had
surrendered.
He sprang to his feet with the happy excla
mation which proved to be his last words,
"Now 1 can die happy." [Great cheering.]
Congress gave very scant aid to the great in
â¢ vention, and some of the old statesmen
laughed to scorn a proposition to make a small
appropriation for connecting Washington and
Baltimore by a telegraph line, saying it was
chimerical and could not be done [laughter],
and yet they lived to see 6uch lines practi
cally girdle the gloDe. American genius and
erterprise, wiser than the law-givers, was
soon extending wires everywhere, until now
I believe it is estimated that the American
lines extend for 250,000 miles, with 800,000
miles of wire, 26,000 offices and 42,000 em
ployes. Everywhere the service is efficient and
reliable [great cheering], and I congratulate
the telegraphers of Chicago and the repie
sentatives of those of the entire country on
the marvelous skill, rapidity and accuracy
with which the millions of messages almost
dai>y are handled and transmitted. [Ap
plause.]
It is gratifying, too, to find them as sensible
in politics as in business [great applause];
as quick to enhance the prosperity of the
country and as unitedly in support of the
right as they are uniformly attentive and
obliging to the public. [Great applause.]
1 thank you, my fellow-citizens, for your
call and appreciate most highly indeed your
assurances cf support, which your eloquent
spokesmen have presented to me. I wish I
could shake hands with every man in this
audience. [Cries of '-We wish you could, too,
major."] Ido not know that I can do it, but I
am glad to meet you and greet you and am
glad to know that you are enlisted in the
great cause as against public repudiation.
[Tremendous cheering.]
The delegations" from Button and Mer
cer counties were just behind the Chicago
men. As soon as they could find room
they took their places near tne stand.
There were 1700 in the two delegations.
Major McKinley said to them:
My Fellow-fitizens: I appreciate the message
which comes from the farmers, from the work
insmen of those two counties, and from ray
feilow -citizens generally, and I thank them all
from the bottom of my heart for their warm
tender of assurance of fidelity to the Republi
can cause and to the Republican party. [Cries
of "Hurrah for McKinley."]
What we want in this country, first and fore
most, is work for the American workmgmen.
[Applause.] And lam one of those who be
lieve in the doctrine of protecting American
factories against foreign factories. [Cries of
"Good."] What we want Is a chance to work,
and when we have wages the home market is
improved for the larmer. We want honest
American dollars. [Criei of "That's right."]
You must vote lor the party that you be
lieve is more likely to give you the best chance
for work and the best coin in payment, and
you must judge for yourself which party that
is. [A voice: "We already know."] I thank
you lor this call and wish I could talk longer,
but must bid you all good-by. [Continued ap
plause.]
A delegation of Pittsburg and vVestern
Railroad men from Pittsburg, Pa., were
the next callers, and Major McKinley ad
dressed them briefly.
At 3 o'clock the commercial travelprs of
Cincinnati called. Mayor John A. Cald
well accompanied them. They brought
the Fir.n Regiment band of the Ohio Na
tional Guanl. Levi C. Goodale was spokes
man. Major McKinley was most heartily
cheered when ue mounted the stand. He
said:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Com
mercial Travelers' Association of Cincinnati:
It gives me great pleasure to welcome you
here to Canton and to my home, a pleasure en
hanced by my acquaintance with many of you
personally.
If to the six great States, including Minnesota,
which originally were comprised in the old
Northwest Territory, of which Cincinnati was
tne capital, you add the rapidly growing Sutes
beyond the Mississippi and east of the Rocky
Mountains and those to the south of the Ohio
and between It and the Gulf, and contrast
their present population and importance
with what is was in 1860 or 1870, even the
most cursory examination will ba full of in
terest, and suggest possibilities for the future
of the most amazing character.
In these nineteen Siates and two Territories
is a greater population to-day, and more than
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1896.
half as much wealth as in the whole country
in 1800, a population approximating 38,000,
-000 in 1890, a gain since 1870 of piactically
100 per cent and property of the assessed valua
tion of nearly $10,000,000,000.
This was the achievement of twenty years,
this creation of a new nation within the old,
greater than the parent itself under the wise
lews enacted and enforced, and under the
policy marked out by the great Republican
party.
In these twenty years the protective policy
was steadily pursued, and our present gold
standard of values was the basis of all the
money issued, whether gold, silver or paper.
Yet there are those who insist upon
declaring that this excellent monetary
system, and that the dollar^ we now have in
circulation, -every one of which has been
worth 100 cents in gold every minute of every
hour of every day since January 1, 1879, is
impoverishing the West and bankrupting all
Its peope. [Applause.]
The Mississippi Valley is surely part of the
West, and the marvelons growth told by the
census figures, the official authority, proves
the falsity and absurdity of their statements.
The new promising States of North and
South Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska and Minne
sota are certainly younst giants of the West,
and their growth in population from 1,940,000
in 1870 to 4,290,000 in 1890, and wealth ofsl,
-825,000,000 demonstrates to fair-minded men
that however much they have suffered by
drouths and poor crops, they are still reason
ably vigorous [laughter] and in no very great
danger of being abandoned or bankrupted.
[Applause.]
All have made remarkable progress; all
have gained immensely in both people and
wealth, the older States not nearly so rapidly
as the newer, but all going anead at a steady
and healthy pace, and all the time they have
been making this progress we have been under
a protective tariff and upon a sound money
gold basts.
Xhe great trouble in this country is that we
have not enough to do lor our people. [Ap
plause.] We had every man employed in this
country in 1892 at the Lest wages that had
ever been paid to any workingmen in the
world. What is ihe matter now? It is lack of
confidence.
What we want in this country, in the first
instance, is a restoration of confidence, and
the only way to have confidence in the Gov
ernment and among the people is fir the Gov
ernmeat to hnvo a revenue policy thst will
supply enough money to pay its expenses.
[Applause.]
You cannot create confidence among the
people if you have no confidence in the public
treasury. Our dollars now are all full aud
sound and all we want is an opportunity to
earn them. How can this be secured? [A
voice: *'E:ect McKinley."]
"VWMI, I do no 1 know what you may think
about it, but I believe the best way to restore
prosperity to the people of the United State*
is to do ail our work at home at the Ame riran
scale of wages and on the basis 01 American
institutions and ideals, fully recognizing the
necewityof a free, enlightened and dignified
citizenship. [Applause]
Following ciosely upon the commercial
travelers came a delegation of 1500 ironi
Pittsburg and vicinity, also commercial
travelers. Major McKinley addressed
them briefly on lines similar to his recent
speeches to delegations of that character,
and at 4:30 came a sprightly delegation of
Hungarian-Americans' from Cleveland.
Their spokesman, J. C. Bloch, made a
long address to Major McKinley, who had
been standing in the chill air on an ex
posed platform occupied with the various
delegations. M?jor McKinley made a
neat response.
Then came a delegation of Cleveland
hardware men, numbering several hun
dred, whom the Republican candidate ad
dressed in a happy vein.
Major McKinley also spoke to a delega
tion from Oakmont and Verona, Pa., and
a big delegation of steel-workers from tbe
Carnegie mills, Pittsburg.
CANDIDATE ROBERT TALKS.
OrÂ«e>(f at Headquarters by a Delega
tion of Commercial Travelers.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 19â There
were many callers this morning at Repub
lican National Headquarters. Senator
Quay and Chuirman J. H. Manley of
Maine were also early on hand. It was
sad that Senator Quay intends to have a
meeting of ihe executive committee to
adopt a plan of campaign in regard to the
Southern States, and also to decide upon
some definite plan in regard to all doubt
ful States.
It has been represented to the commit
tee that there is an excellent chance of
canying Alabama for McKinley and
Hobart and a decided effort will be made
to carry that State. Encourag.ng reports
are also coming in from Florida, North
Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.
A delegation of commercial travelers
calied on Vice-Presidential candidate
Hobart to-day at headquarters. The dele
gation was accompanied by his special
guest, the Hon. Charles E. Warwick of
Philadelphia. Mr. Hobart thanked them
for their kindness and told them that he
knew the commercial travelers were a set
of men who would not be bunkoed by any
Chicago platform. Mr. Hobart said in
his address:
lam very glad to meet you, gentlemen. I
do not propose to make a speech this morning,
but I would do an injustice to myself and
would be ungracious to your kindness if I did
not thank you heartily and generously for the
beautiful words of welcome and cheer which
you have professed. I know that this enthu
siasm is born of your love and your loyalty for
the ticket which I have tha honor to repre
sent.
When I think of the commercial travelers, 1
think of them as a class of men who have
never been "bunkoed," or If any one of them
ever bag been, history has failed to record it.
And so, whenever, since the nomination, I
have thought of the commercial travelers at
an independent class of citizens, I have re
garded them as a class of men who I know
will not be bunkoed by any piatform like the
Chicago platform, embracing as it does false
political doctrines and policies inimical to the
honor and the integrity of the Nation and
favoring a debased and dishonest dollar. Your
organization has been a great help to this
committee in a great many ways, all of which
we fully appreciate and are quick to recognize.
Your membership reaches all over this wide
and growing country, and mere is from each
of you a continual stream of influence radiat
ing wherever you go. And the reason why
your organization is so all-powerful and at the
same time so satisfactory to the committee is
that, whereas the time of the committee is
taken up with instructions to voters, we
realize that the commercial travelers are ac
customcl to make sentiment wherever they
go, aud they know as well as the National
Committee where to go, what to do and how
to do the important worV laid out ior this
campaign.
There was great cheering as Mr. Hobart
concluded. Then the members of the
delegation were personally introduced to
Candidate Hobart. Senator Quay, Chair
man Munley, General Osborne and Com
mitteeman Bcott. Chairman Manley was
cheered by the delegation.
WORK NEEDED IN THE WEST.
But the Republican Party Organization
It in Sighting Trim.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 19.â Chairman
Hanna left for Cleveland to-ni^ht, and,
after spending Sunday at home, he will
go to New York for ten duys. He has
been in Chicago longer this time than on
any other occasion since lie organized the
Western headquarters, and he has been
constantly at work at his deslr. He ad
mits that hard worK is needed in the
Webt to win, and when he returns he will
devote all his time nntil the close of the
campaign to thin center of the political
battle. He said before leaving that hÂ« -was
better satisfied with the Western situation
than when he came here. The party
organization from the Ohio to the Mis
souri River was not only in splendid right
ing form, but it had accomplished more
in the way of direct and tangible results
thau ever he or his associates nad antici
pated. During the last two weeks there
had been a gradual brightening of the
political horizon.
He was satisfied that Mr. McKinley
wouid not only carry the great central
States oi the West by handsome majori
ties but that he would probably win other
States whose electoral vote is now confi
dently claimed by the Dernocr;vt<.
Henry C. Payne wHI apaiu take charge
of headquarters in Mr. Raima's absence,
and will devote all his time to the trans
action of business here. He left last night
fur his home in Milwaukee to return Mon
day morning.
Ttr>tnn amt Watson Elector*.
TOPEKA, Kass., Sept. 19.â A middle
of-the-road Populist State Convention was
to have been held here to-day for ttie pur
pose of placing Bryan and Watson elec
tors in tbe field, but it was called off by a
telegram received by John P. Willits. the
National lecturer for the old Farmers' Al
liance and thy representative of Mr. Wat
son in Kansas. The v co-presidential
nominee sent ttie telegram and gave in
structions for an electoral ticket to be
placed on the ballot by petition under the
Australian law. It waÂ» feared the fusion
Populists would get control of the conven
tion and the petition oian was adopted to
make sure of separate electors.
Riot at a Sleeting.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Sept. 19.â At Cen
trai Armory to-night, Terence V. Pow
derfy addressed a Republican meeting.
Perfect pandemonium broke loose when
the chairman was introduced, and it was
almost impossible for him to proceed with
the meetine. A serious riot seemed im

SAN JOSE CONFESSION.
Harvey Al/ender'a Story of the Murder of
Venanz Crosetti and Miss
Feilner.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 19.â Harvey Al
lender, who was yesterday convicted of
murder in the first degree, and upon
whom the sentence of death will be passed
next Friday, this morning told his story
of the killing of Miss Wa.'burga Feilner
and Venang Crosetti on Sunday afternoon,
August 9. Allender complains that he
was not accorded a fair trial. He says
his case was 'railroaded" through, and
that most of the testimony was perjured.
The condemned man seems resigned to
his fate and is not worrying over his con
viction.
After denouncing Fred Schiele, who
lie says was the cause of tbe row between
himself and Crosetti, Jamison, Jepson,
Barker and Miss Lawler, all witnesses for
the vrosecuikm, he told of his meeting
Miss Feilner anrt the shooting.
"I first met Miss Feilner at Kenney's
dancing-school in the Pbelan block," said
he. "After we had been acquainted about
six months, and had danced much to
gether, she told me shÂ« loved me. She
said she took a liking to me tha first time
she saw me. She said she had intended to
go away, but having met me she wouid re
main.
"After we got going together we had
several scats. I don't want to talk about
the girl now, but she used to tell me so
many lies about everything and that
raused our trouble. Never in my life did
I insult her or any other lady, and I know
hundreds of them in San Jose. The girl
was always fooling me, making appoint
ments and then placing me in a ridiculous
iisrht. Tbe night of the celebration of the
Fall of the B:istile last year I met her at a
party. She then asked me to see her the
next Saturday night at First and Fernando
streets. I met her there and she imme
diately got Night Watchman Blanchard
and. pointing me out, said: 'There he 19.'
"At the time I first met the girl 1 was a
different man than lam now. She kept
me in that frame of mind that has worn
me down to tbe sickly man I am â¢ Nervous
ness won't allow me to stand stiil a min
ute. That girl wrecked me, but I don't
want to say anything about her now."
Regarding the double murder he said
that when he met Crosetti and Miss
Feilner, Crosetti starred toward him and
made a movement as though to draw a
revolver. Then he drew and fired at
Crosetti, but missed him and killed the
girl. Crosetti pounced upon Allender and
was killed.

FREDERICKSBURG, Va., Bept. 19.â
Up at dawn and uff for Washington at 7
o'clock was the way Bryan began his pro
gramme for to-day. He arrived here at 9
o'clock, delivered a Bueech at 11 o'clock
and left for Washington at 1:49 p. M. Ash
land, the seat of the Ranclolph-Macon
College, had Bryan for two minutes, and
most of those who heard him there were
students. To them he said :
I believe this county claims the honor of
being the birthplace of two of America's great
est men. Henry Clay was born in this county,
as was also Patrick Henry. I believe the pol
icy for which I stand in this campaign in
some respects revives the memory of botn
men. Henry Clay in 1845 described the effects
of contracting the currency, aud Patrick
Henry was in favor of an American policy.
At 11 o'clock Bryan was taken to tbe
monument erected to the memory of Mary
Washington, mother of George Washing
ton, who lived here with her distinguished
son for many years. Here a stand had
been erected and the candidate addressed
a large gathering oi Virginians. Con
gressman Jones introduced Mr. Bryan,
who said:
Ladies and Gentlemen : lam grateiul to the
Mayor of your city for his eloquent words of
welcome. I am glad to renew my acquaint
ance with my colleague in Congress who has
so kindly presented me, and I am pleased to
greet the psople who have assembled in such
large numbers upon this occasion.
Fredericks burg is not a large city, and yet it
is rich in incidents of great historic valtte.
Here the women of America have reared a
monument to Mary, tbe mother of George
â Washington. [Great applause.] lam glad to
stand on this spot and I am giad to feel the in
fluences which surround her grave. In a
campaign, especially In a campaign I'ko this,
there is bitterness and sometimes abuse lev
eled against the candidates ior pub.ic office,
but, my friends, there is one character â the
mother, the candidate for the affections of all
mptikiudâ agnin.-t whom no true man ever
uttered a word of abuse. [Great applause]
And there is one rame â -'mother" â which is
never found upon the tongue of the slanderer.
In her presence all criticism is silent. The
painter has with his brush transferred the
landscape to the canvas, so that you can al
most believe that the trees and grasses are real
rather thnn imitations.
Thd painter has even transferred to the
canvas the face of the maiden until its beauty
and purity almost speak forth, but there is
one picture which no painter has ever been
able to faithfully portray, and that Is a
picture of a mother holding in her arms her
babe. [Great applause.] Within the shadow
of this monument, reared to her who in her
love and loyalty was the mother of each one of
us, I bow in humble reverence to motherhood.
[Great applause.]
1 am told that in this county were fought
more battles than in any county of like size in
the world, and that upon the earth within the
limits of this county there fell more dead and
wounded than ever fell on a similar space in
the history of the world. Here opposing lines
were drawn up face to face; here opposing
armies met and stared at each other and then
sought to take each other's lives.
But all those scenes have passed away, and
those who met in deadly array now meet and
commingle here as friends. Here the plow-
Bhare has been made out of the sword, and the
spears have beeu converted into Druning
hooks, and people learn war no more. Here
the bands on either side stir up the flagging
zeal with notes that thrill the hearts of men.
These two bands are to-morrow component
parts of one greet band, and as that band
marches on in the lead, playing "Yankee
Dood:e," and "Dixie," too [Great applause],
behind the band follow the war-scarred veter
ans who wore the blue and the war-scarred
veterans who wore the gray, each vying with
each other in the effort to make this the great
est and grandest Nation on God's footstool.
[Great cheering.]
lam glnd to visit this historic place. They
say that here George Washington once came
ami threw a silver dollar aiross the river; but
remember, my friends, that when he thraw
that silver dollar across the river it lit â it fell
and remained on American soil. [Great cheer
ing.] They thought that it was a great feat
then, but we have developed so rapialy in the
last hundred years that we have financiers
now who can leave George Washington's
achievement far behind. We have financiers
who have been able to throw gold dollars all
the way pcross the Atlantic and then bring
tbjem back by an issue of bonds. [Great cheer
ine.]
D<> you believe, my friends, that a silver dol
lar which was good enough to be handled by
the Father of his Country, is now so mean a
thing as to excite the contempt of many of our
so-called financiers ? [No, no.] Well, it is; it
is so mean that they don't lite it. Why, our
opponents tell us that they want a dollar that
wi.l go all over the world. We have had dol
lars which have gone over the world so rapidly
that we want a dollar that will stay at home
without a curfew law. [cheers.] Our oppo
nents tells us that they want a dollar which
they can see anywhere in the world if they
travel abroad. I want a dollar that won't be
ashamed to look a farmer in the face. [Loud
applause.]
People can have just as good a dollar as they
want, because dollars are creatures of law,
end you can determine the purchasing power
of a dollar when you determine the number of
dollars. If you want dollars dear, make them
scarce end they will be dear. If our (jollars
are good enough now, when a dollar will buy
ten busiiols of oats, you can make it good
enough so that it will buy 100 bushels of oats,
f A voice: "Weaon'twant that kind of a dol
lar."] If anybody here has been raising farm
products and complaining because they are
not cheap enough, you can make them
cheaper if you vote the Republican ticket thiÃ
fail.

GENERAL GRAHAM SATISFIES
Although Nearing the Age of Retire
ment He Cheerfully Returns
to the Everg ades.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Bept 19.â The
War Department is completing arrange
ments for the transfer of the Fifth Artil
lery Regiment from the Presidio to
Florida. Orders will soon be forwarded
to the Department of California head
quarters. It is expected that the transfer
will not be made earlier than December.
Colonel Shafter, commanding; the De
partment of California, and Genera)
Graham, the regimental commander of
the Fifth Artillery, have been officially
advised of the order transferring this regi
ment to the Department of the East.
Following is a ccpy of the official order
received yesterday:
Washington, D. C, Pept. 18, 1896.
Commanding General, Department of Califor
nia, San Francisco: Orders about to issue to
transfer the Fifth Artillery to Department of
the East, except one light battery, to be se
lected by the regimental commander, which
goes to Fort Sam Houston, Tex. The other
light battery is to take station at 'Washington
Barracks. The horses, guns ana battery
equipments will be left behind to be taken
by the exchanging bntterles of the Third Ar
tillery. General Otis advised Â«s to battery at
Canby. Make preparation for change accord
ingly. By command,
Major-General Miles.
EUvun Breck, Acting Adjutant-General.
It is surmised here in military circles
that powerful influences were invoked in
New York and Boston to save the First
Artillery, now in New York harbor, from
a tonr of duty in the South. Under a fair
detail the First, which has escaped South
ern duty for twenty-one years, should be
sent to garrison the forls in Florida,
Louisiana and Texas. The First|has had
but three years of duty in that region
since the war, while the Fifth has had
one turn of duty from 1865 to 1867 and a
second from 1875 to 1881.
it is known in San Francisco that the
Secretary of War was reluctant to incur
the expens" of moving two regiments
across the continent. When he figures the
slight cost of exchanging the First and
Third, as compared with the enormou3
expense of exchanging the Third and
Fifth, he will see how the public money
may be squandered to gratify favorites in
New York and Washington society.
It is highly probable that United States
Senators White and Perkins may be in
duced, in behalf of justice and fair deal
ing, to submit some facts to the Secretary
of War which may have escaped his
observation. .Commissioned officers of the
Fifth Artillery can stand the pecuniary
hardships of the transfer. If they have
not the ready money to move their fami
lies they can borrow it, but it is said that
the musicians, non-commissioned officers
and enlisted men who have families de
pendent upon them must endure a genera!
home breaking up to meet the wishes of
court favorites in the East.
General Graham was seen yesterday at
Presidio headquarters and asked if he "had
mÂ»de the assignment of one of his li ht
batteries to Fort Sam Houston (San An
tonio), Texas, as the official order of trans
fer authorized.
He said that he had not yet decided oi
that detail.
A suggestion was made that General
Graham, having only two years more to
serve before attainine the age of retire
ment, eight ask to be retired rather than
go to Florida again. Replying to this
suggestion, he said:
"I have served in the army forty-one
years and I have never yet allowed con
siderations of individual convenience
to influence me in the performance
of duty. I shall not change my
course now. The idea of retirement has
not entered my mind. Yes, I understand
that regimental headquarters will be at St.
Augustine. Lieutenant-Colonel Sinclair
may prefer to accept the post at Fort Jack
son, near New Orleans. One major will
probably be at regimental headquarters.
The other two will be assigned to duty
elsewhere in the territory to be garri
soned. I served in the Everglades of
Florida in 1855. I was there again with
the First Artillery, when the Fifth re
lieved us. S.t. Augustine is a pleasant
place to one who is inclined to lead an
.idle or inactive life."
General Graham fancies that tbe Fifth
will not leave here before December.
MEXICANS PLAN A RAID.
Lawless Men Gather on the Borders of
Texas to Join the Followers of
Santa Teresa.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Sept. 19.-J. C.
Lawlings, a well-known ranchman of Pre
sidio County, arrived here yesterday. He
reports a large band of armed Mexicans
congregating on the Tex s side of the Rio
Grnnde River for the past ten days.
Tbe band numbered fully 800 persons
when he left there ycfrday, and their
leaders stated that they were going to
cross into Mexico, to join the followers of
Santa Teresa, All were well mounted and
armed.
The recruits were ignorant of the leader's
plans. The attention of the authorities
has been called to the rendezvous, and the
Sheriff and rangers have gone to the
locality. An effort will be made to arrest
the Mexicans on the charge of violating
the neutrality laws of the United States.
.The Mexican authorities have been
warned and are on guard at tbe various
points along the border, where it is prob
able the raiders will cross. Ever since the
attack on the Nogalea Custom -house
Mexican troops have been heid in
readiness for instant service whenever
they might be needed, and there
is but little doubt that they could
easily repel invaders without assistance
from the United States. The only trouble
is that the raiders might succeed in get
ting across the border and doing consider
able damage before they could be over
taken and reduced to subjection. Those
gatherings in Texas, while made up
largely of desperate, lawless men, are still
without discipline or organization and
without a recognized leader.

Powder Mill* Jiloun Vp by Lightning.
HAZARDVILLE, Conn., Sept. 19.â
Four mills of the Hazardville Powder
Company blew up early this morning.
The shock was felt twenty miles. No one
â was killed or injured so far as known, as
the workmen had not yet entered the
mills. The explosion was caused by light
ning.

II THE PATH OF STORMS
Destruction and Perhaps Death
Caused by a Cyclone in
Massachusetts.
Cotton-Mi Is Struck by Lghtning and
Buildings Wrecked by the
W.nd.
NEW BEDFORD, MAes.,S*pt. 19.â A cy
clone from the west struck this city early
this morning, dealing out destruction on
every hand and perhaps death in one in
stance. There was, of course, an im
mense number of minor accidents, trees
uprooted, etc., but soon after daylight a
particularly heavy burst caused damage
of more serious import.
About 6:30 o'clock a hnge bolt of light
ning descended from a cloud of inky black
ness upon the big cotton shed of the Ben
nett mills. It ignited the inflammable
contents and imperiled neaily 8000 bales
of cotton of high grade and long staple. It
took the firemen three hours to cet the
mad blaze subdued, and in all about 2500
bales, valued at upward of $100,000, were
injured.
Much of this damage will be offset by
the proceeds of the sale of the damaged
cotton, but it will still be a very heavy
loss. It is generally insured. The cotton
house was destroyed and involved a loss
of perhaps $6000.
In the midst of the mill fire another cy
clone buist upon the city, characterized by
a terrific wind and a torrent of rain.
The crowd near the mill fire ran for
shelter and about twenty of them found
it in a new buiidine at the corner of
Coggeshall and North Front streets. No
sooner were they entered than the wind
took up the building, raised the roof
bodily and the whole structure fell with a
crash.
All but one in the building escaped. He
was Zoel Levigney, a Frenchman, aged 65
years, who had run in for shelter. He was
pinned down by heavy timbers, his spine
Inland, several ribs broken and internally
injured. The narrow escape of the car
penters forms a remarkable story.
The building was the property of the
contractor and is a total loss of $3000.
Several other houses were unrooted. In
Fairhaven big elms were uprooted and
tilled the streets for a time. In South
Dartmouth several buildings were blown
down and a horse killed.
On the Fair Haven bridge a streetcar
barely escaped a big tree from Pape's
Island, and travel was blocked some time.
Reports from suburban territory are to
the effect that the storm was of fearful
severity.
OGDEN, Utah, Sept. 19.â Further re
ports of the storm of last night indicate
that there was widespread disaster in all
of the country tributary to O^den. The
most important was the wreckinp entire
of the large machine shops at the mouth
of Ogden Canyon, where the Pioneer Elec
tric Power Company is putting up the
steel pipe for their million-dollar plant.
The shop 3 were directly in the line of
the storm and were blown flat, the thirty
ton steel crane crashing down into the
machinery and badly damaging it. There
were .500 workmen at or near the shops, !
but, no one was hurt. Damage here about 'â 
$30,000.
All fruit was blown off the trees, the
Reform Schooi building was unroofed and
schoolhouses and barns all over the county
are wrecked.
At Hot Springs, ten miles north of
Ogden, the hotel building was damaged lo
the extent of about $1000. The total dam
age in this county will reach $200,000.
In Ogden many Duildings were badly
damaged, but the amount cannot yet be
estimated. Trains were badly delayed by
fallen trees last night, but everything is
running on time to-night.
HELD AT REDWOOD CITY.
Mrs. Alice Burns Must Stand Trial in the
Superior Court on a Forgery
Charge.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Sept 19.â Mrs.
Alifte Burns, a daughter of Banker Hol
lingsworth of Woodland, was to-day or

Mrs. Burns in March negotiated the sale

and admits that she knew of the transac
tian. She went to live with another son,

on a bond given by her father. The pre
liminary examination bei;an on Thursday
fh â¢â¢ concluded to-day. In place of

STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 19.-Ed Weir
was stabbed to-night by George W. Hall
a blacksmith. The wound was made with
a six-inch dirkknife ana. while not 'iable
to prove fatal, is very serious. The men
were in the Mirror saloon ana Hall twitted
Weir with the fact that he recently failed
in business. Words brought on blows
and Hall drew and used his dirk.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1896.
FILCHED FROM
SHASTA'S VAULTS
County Treasurer Jackson
Found to Be a Heavy
Embezzler.
MANY THOUSANDS SHORT
Believed to Have Robbed the
Exchequer Systematically
for Years.
EXPOSED BY HIS OWN RUSE.
Lurid Tale of a Raid by Outlaws
Aroused the Suspicion of His
Bondsmen.
REDDING, Cal., Sept. 19.â What ap
peared at first to have been an attempted j
robbery of Shasta County's treasury ha* I
transpired to have been a ruse of the
present County Treasurer, William Jack
son, to throw a veil over the embezzle
ment of a large sum of the county's funds
at the hands of that "watchdoe of the
treasury," who for seventeen years past
has been intrusted with the office.
The report Wednesday morning of the
attempted raid on the treasury from the
lips of the County .Treasurer himself was
received with suspicion by County Treas
urer Jackson's acquaintances, and espe
cially among his closest political friends'
was his statement discredited. It had
been known that Jackson had been the
victim of an over-indulgence in wine for
many months. His bondsmen, thinking
things were not running as smoothly as !
they might, instituted an investigation, !
and as a result Jackson, who has been j
looked upon as an honest, upright and j
conscientious office-holder, has been ;
branded as an embezzler who appropriated I
various sums of county money to his own I
use, causing his own ruin and ti.e deple- !
tion of the pocketbooks of his bondsmen, j
An investigation of County Treasurer
Jackson's books and accounts reveals the
fact that he is at least $12,800 short, and it
is the opinion of his bondsmen that before
the expert finishes his examination he
will have been bound to be an embezzler
to the extent of $15,000 or $17,000.
On Wednesday morning, about 7:30
I o'clock, Jackson appeared before the po
lice authorities of this city, bis head badly
lacerated and cut, and bleeding from
; wounds. He declared that three masked
! men appeared at hip residence and com
manded him at tbe point of revolvers to
go to his office, in the courthouse, three
blocks distant, and open the vaults of the
county treasury. Jackson stated that be
I told the robbers that it was useless for
them to attempt to rob the vault, as it had
a time lock and even he could not gain
I access. According to his story they
marched him to the courthouse, one rob
ber on either side of Him. At the door
of his office, he said, it occurred to him to
I make a defense, and on opening the door
j he states, he seized a large rock, which w:ij
, lyinc on the counter, and with a swift
j back-handed blow felled one of the rob
| bers. The other, he said, hit him over the '
I head, felling him to thÂ« floor.
Jackson said he lay unconscious for
j some twenty minutes, when, regaining
I consciousness, he washed the blood from I
j hi? face and started in search for the rob
bers. The janitor of the courthouse heard j
nothing of the disturbance, nor did any of
the neighbors living near Jackson's house. !
This story, together with the known fact |
of Jackson's debauchery of the weelc past i
caused suspicion, and his bondsmen in- '
stituted tie investigation.
Investment in stocKs has helped to
diminish Jackson's accounts. Only last I
August, it is said, he invested some" $7800
with a firm in San Francisco and lost it.
In order to mislead his constituents and
the people he so arranged it that his
monthly reports would show a surplus in
the treasury. This was easily accom
plished. A worthless check in the sum of
$9000, supposed to be money on deposit
with the State Treasurer, was each month
carried and entered in his reports as so
much money on deposit.
The experts who at various times looked
over the county books took it for granted
that that check was valid and so reported.
From time to time his report was ac
cepted, and had it not been for his ridicu
lous story regardine the allege l robbery
he would have been enabled to have con
tinued his raid on the county treasury in- '
definitely.
Jackson is virtually out of office to-night, i
His bondsmen have charge of his books â¢
and accounts, and Deputy Recorder Ross i
has been placed in charge of tbe Treas- '
urer's office for the bondsmen. They are
all reputable an.l substantial citizens a.id !
will be compelled to make goo<! the deft
ciency, which may amount to $20 000. The \
County Treasurer's bond was for the sum
of $120,000, the deficiency having to be
borne equally by some nine bondsmen.
DEL MONTE' S LIVELY SEASON.
Many Summer Guests Show Mo Intention
of Departing and New Arrivals Are
Pouring in Daily.
DEL MONTE. Cal., Sept. 19.â Still the
season at Del Monte I. olds out. Although
a great many of the summer guests have
gone quite a number of the prominent
families remain to enjoy the fine fishing
I and hunting hereabouts and other amuse
ments to be found at tne big caravansary.
Two of the most prominent families that
will remain through September are the
Crockers and J. A. Donohoe. The baths
seem alive with people every morning
between 11 and 1, and the surf, too, comes
in for its share of bathers. The cold surf
of Monterey Bay is so invigorating, any
way, ihat most all of the guests take a dip
each day.
Driving and horseback riding occupy
the earlier afternoon and wheeling and
tennis between 5 and 6 seem to be tbe
proper thine. Many wheeling parties
have been formed during the past week
in order to befittingly celebrate the glori
ous moonlight of the nights. Moonlight
coaching parties to the wrecked steamer
St. Paul, near the Point Pinos lighthouse
also have been popular this week.
T<> say the least. Dal Monte is indeed
gay, and guests remaining seem to find all
their time taKen up ftoni morning till
nisbt. Juan Vitere, one of tbe largest
coffee planters of Guatemala, arrived Fri
day with his family and will remain until
tbe middle of October or longer.
Among other guests of the week are*
W. K. T. Sachrn, PittSDurg; H. W. Rowall
Captain F. W. Hart, W. H. McCarthy

PORTLAND MEN IN LUCK
Encouraging News From a Youth
Who Left Many Creditors ia
the Lurch.
Successfully Plays the Role of the
Prodigal San and Will Pay All
His Debts.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept. 19.â Former
friends of J. H. Flinders of San Francisco
and Portland, who mourned his departure
for England much less than they did the
loss of various large sums of money which
they had advanced him, will be pleased to
bear that he is now in a position to pay
his debts, and is preparing to do so. He
is in London, and a complete reformation
of his habits has been effected through the
me lium of a series of parental lectures.
Flinders' father owns a bank in London,
and he is also a largo stockholder in the
London and San Francisco Bank. Young
Flinders was rather wild in his ways, and
he pasted not a few of his days in the same
way that a young Englishman of wealthy
family, high social connections and fast
companions usually does.
About a year or two ago his parents
thought a change of climate and com
panions would cause a change in his
habits, and accordingly his father sent
him to |PorUand to take a position as
bookkeeper in the local branch of the Lon
don and San Francisco Bank.
Of excellent social qualities and finely
educated, Flinders was not long in this
city before be became a favorite with his
associates. He led a fast life and on the
first of each month he found that his sal
ary was not sufficient to pay his bills, so
he resorted to borrowing. He obtained
sums of from $20 to $50 from his friends,
but these amounts did not assist him in
paying his debts, for he loaned money at
random almost as soon as he received it.
Two months ngo he was about $1000 short
in his accounts with his friends, and hav
ing no money with which to pay the bills
he decided to return to England.
A friend of Flinders to-day received a
letter from nim stating that he intended
to pay all obligations contracted by him
wnile in this city. Some ugly reports
abont a woman being at the bottom of
Flinders' financial trouble have been in
circulation and have been denied by his
friends. It has also been reported that he
drew three months' salary in advance
from the London and San Francisco Bank
and left without formally or informally
tendering his resignation to the manage
ment, but this is denied by the local offi
cials of the bank. The woman who was
generally supposed to be mixed up in
Flinders' affairs was a Mrs. McDonald,
who distinguished herself a few months
ago by shooting a newspaper man in San
Fran CISCO-

Outside of the inaccessible portions of the
mountains, the heaviest snowfall is re

said to have fallen since 8 o'clock this

of the storm. It seems to be gaining in
fury, and the heaviest snowfall in years

RACING IN MUD
AT SACRAMENTO
Rain Dampens the Ardor of
Horse and Jockey at
the Track.
LAST DAY OF THE MEET
Lumina Captures the Autumn
Stake With Vincitor in
the Place.
BUT ONE FAVORITE IN FRONT
Mainstay, His Owner and Rider
Ruled Off for Life by the
Judges.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 19.â A driz
zling rain that betran last night and con
tinued at intermittent spells throughont
to-day dampened the ardor of both horse
men and spectators, and the concluding
day of the big State Fair meet saw but an
ordinary crowd in attendance. It rained
just enough to make the going juicy, and
as the jockeys, all bespattered with mud
and looking like cannibal islanders, re
turned to the stand at tne conclusion of
each race the spectacle afforded much
amusement to the occupants of the grand
stand.
Tha last day of all fair meetings is gen
erally considered "get-away" day, and in
many respects this vras no exception,
first choices in the betting succeeding in
capturing but one of the six races on the
card. The horses that plucked the purses
were: Principle, an Bto 1 shot, owned by
George Rose; Sabiila, a k 7 to 1 outsider;
Lumina, winner of the Autumn handicap ;
Articus, a favorite for the mile and a six
teenth run;. Reddington, the runaway
winner of the Darktown Derby, and finally
Charlie Boots, which took the hurdle event
at a mile and a furlong, with the jumps
omitted. Articus also enjoyed a walk
over for the Fail stake at a mile and a
haif.
A disastrous sequel marked the six
furlong dash that was second on the card.
The big colt Mainstay, with Charley
Daniels up, opened a 5 to 2 favorite, but
receded to 7to 2. It looked as though the
ri ier was not greedy for the purse, and
while shoving the bunch in running in
last position, he fell down about twenty
yards from the wire. The exhibition was
euch a poor one that the judges ruled
Jockey Daniels, the horse's owner, A. I
Lindsay, and the big sprinter himself, off
for life"
As though a forewarner of danger, the
7 to 5 choice, Alazan, for the opening five
and a half furlong scramble ior maiden
two-year-olds, finished third. Principle,
who receded from 6 to 8 to 1 in the betting,
assumed the lead in the stretch, and in a
drive beat the 12 to 1 shot Link Boy out a
head in a hard drive. The piunger, well
backed, stumbled soon after the start,
finishing back in the rack.
Ten selling-platers starting in a six-fur
long spin next furnished a very open bet
tinz affair. Ricardo at threes had the I
call, closely pressed by Hymn, Mainstay
and Seaspray. liumme), well supported
in the bettine, acted badly at the post and
was left. Gradually taking the lead,
Babilla, Pittsburg Phil's old mare, a 7 to 1
chance in the ring, edged to the front,
winning at the stand, three parts of a
length from Ricardo. which was backed
down from 8 to 3. Seaspray, ridden by
Bnycier, filiaily got in third.
The autumn handicap for two-year-olds,
over a mile, worth $710 to the winner, rc
eulted in a decisive victory for Lumina, a
daughter of the dead Martenhurst, run
ning in the colors of El Primero stable.
In the betting Tea Rose and Geyser
coupled were strong 7 to 5 choices', with j
Lumina next fancied at twos. Vincitor,
True Blue and Howard 8 were the other
Btarters.
Tea Rose was sent out to make the run
ning, closely followed into tne stretch by
Vincitor and Lumina. The brother to
Vinctor put up a strong argument, but
Lumina got the lead over him less than
a furlong from home, and won very
handily in L:4S)Â£. Howard 8 made up a
deal of ground in the stretch, finishing
thirl. McGlone, a new rider to the Cali
fornia race-going public previous to the
present State Fair meet, put ud an excel
lent ride#on Vincitor.
Thu betting about the five starters in the
one and a sixteenth mile selling run
looked a trifle peculiar at times, but "ail's
well that ends well." After opening at 8
to 5 and touching 9 to 5, Articus was
backed down u> 3 to 2 and trailing Encino
and Jack Kichelieu into the stretch, won
in romping fashion from the first-named
lightweight in 1:5:% Seaside, badly
messed about, was an indifferent third.
Six colored riders of the welter-weight
cliisj, mounted on six good, bad ami in
different horses, contested for the Dark
town derby, over a mile, worth $i 25 to
the lirst horse. Hazard, ridden by Ford,
was the hottest kind of a 4 to 5 cuance,
1 ut Jones astride of Reddingtnn, a 5 to 1
mot In the bettine, carrying 140 pounds,
jumped out in from when the barrier was
rsis-d, and the others never got near him ;
winning in runaway fashion, with Lorena
li second and the favorite taird.
On account of the Blushy condition of
the track the hurdies were omitted from
the mile and a furlong run, and the affair
â was thereby deprived of much interest.
Malo Diablo was sent out a 7 to 10 favor
ile, but sulked as usual, ending up among
the tail-enders. Spence, on the Bto 5 sec
ond choice Charlie Boots, made the run
ning from the out3et, winning easily from
Gold Dust. JOC, on which Murphy re-
Jrcshed himself the first part of the race
by taking a sound sleep, came with a sur
prising show of sneed at the close, finish
ing a good third.

SAN DIEGO'S FAIR ATHLETES.
Three Sisters Swim Four and a Half
Miles in Two Hours and Ten
Minutes.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept 19.â The
longest swimming race ever held in these
Waters took place this afternoon, and the
principals wer6 girl^-sisters. The course
was from Silver Gate bathhouse, San
Diego, to the National City wharf, four
and a half miles, and it was covered in
two hours and ten minutes.
Acnes, Lena and Carrie Polhamus,
daughters of Captain A. Polharnus, per
formed the wonderful feat. They are
strong, rosy-cheeked and plump girls, ali
born sailors and lovers athletics. Ihey
organized the Zla: Rowing Clnb, the
pioneer girls' club in Southern California,
which was the forerunner of over two
dozen similar clubs.
The bay was quite rough this afternoon
and the party accomDanying the girls in
boats tried to dissuade tt;ein from making
tde attempt. They were determined to
â¢Bwini the distance and kept on. The
wind was quite fresh during the latter
part of the swim. Two pirls and two boys
accompanied the swimmers, rowing two
boats with which to bring the girls back.
On the way down the cir's in the water
laughed, chatted and disported like
Naiads, occasionally racing with each
other, &nd showing no sign of fatiue.
Indeed, on arriving at tne goal Miss
AgneÃ Polhamus drew herself into a boat
unaided and, taking an oar, in company
with Miss Jessie Haight, captain of the
Columbia Club, out-rowed the two boys in
the other boot. This, after such a long
swim, was phenomenal and illustrated
the superb physical condition of the fair
contestant.
SAN JOSE RACE MEETING.
Earnest Morten Will Contest During the
? Cotnlng Fair. ' . .* â 
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 19.â The directors
of the Santa Clara Valley Agricultural
Society have reconsidered their action of
"Wednesday, when it was decided to have
no racing this year on account of the few
entries received, and there will be six
days' racing in this city during the fair,
commencing September 28. The small
number of entries for the racing pro
gramme previously prepared was due to
the classes being too slow. All the slow
horses on the circuit were worked out at
the opening of tha circuit, and the owners
now campaigning did not care to enter
their horses in events below their classes.
Purses amounting to $7500 will be given.
! There will be two harness and two run- \
1 ning events each day. The conditions I
I will be the same as those previously agreed
upon. The pacing events will be for the
2:25 class, 2:20 class, 2:17 class, 2:13 class
and 2:10 class. The trotting races will be
in the same class.
I . C. H. Corey has just returned from Sac
ramento, whither he went to make ar
rangements for the races. He reports
much interest manifested in the meet by
horsemen at the State Fair, and says that i
all the fastest and best horses on the cir
cuit will be here. Already a sufficient
number of entries have been received to
make the meet a success.

game, and he repeated it again to-day.
After seeing the practice games, which he

play, he stated that he found the meu
about as be expected.
"We have a big lot of stout, apparently
conscientious, players to deal 'with, but
their work is quite rapped as yet. Of
course I rather anticipated this "and am
not at all put nut by the discovery. Hard
â work will remedy the matter and a week
will see a big change in the men."

ment of the city government has offered any

turned on and shut off by means of a switch
under the control of the motnrman. Get on
any electric-car and wntch the operation.
Unintelligibleâ J. C, City. Your writing
is so miserable that it Is Impossible to ascer
tain what it is you want to know about some
kind of lax. Have Home one who can write
plain English write the question for you, and
an answer will be furnished, if it ii to be ob
tained.
Backward Jumpâ F. H. 0., City. There does
not appear to be any record for "standing high
jump backward." The only recorl for back
ward jump is three backward jumps with
weights, 31 feet '2 inches, W. Broiley, FarnÂ»
worth, England, February 9, 1895.
Averaok Wagesâ T. 0., City. Without
knowing what particular class of article costs

bow much of the dollar was paid for wages. A
general average of wages is not tne proper way
10 p.s :eriain what proportion of one dollar that
it costs to manufacture an article is paid to the
wagt-earuer.
The Differenceâ J. P. 8., Auburn, CaL Tho
figures for the first nineteen months of the
operation of the McKinley bill and the present
tariff bill show the difference in the United
States Treasury. Under the McKinley bill
there w*Â«, at the end of that ; ctiod, a surplus
of $24,983,221, and under the Wilson-Gorman
bill there whs, at the end of the same number
of months, a deficit of $76,157,884.
Dollars and Certificate*â J. P. 8., Auburn,
CaL From 1878 to June 30, 1896, the total
number of silver dollan coined waa 430,780,
-041. Of the amount coined since February,
1878, there was held In the treasury on the
last day of the fiscal year 1895-96, $378,614.
-043, and the amount outside of the treasury
was $52,175,998. Certificates (silver) were
issard to the amount of $342,619,504, against
the amount in the treasury.
Mining Engineersâ K. C. 0., Bakersfleld,
Cal. Mining engineers are employed in big
mines. To be a successful engineer one must
iv the first place have a likiug for the busi
nesÂ«, must be a good mathematician, must
have a knowledge of surveying, must know
the formatiou of metal-bearing rock and be
abie to determine by assay what the value of
rock is. The best way to acquire that knowl
edge is to work with Â«ome one who is pro
ficient ln such matters. Books that will give
a theoretical knowledge can be obtained of
â ny first-class bookseller, who on application
will furnish a list.
The Figures Not at Handâ J. P. 8., Auburn,
Cal. The figures showing the expenditure for
the fiscal year 1 895-96 are not to be had in this
City as yet; therefore it la impossible at this
time to give the details asked for.
The Act of '73â 8. P. 8., Lodi, Cal. Silver
was not demonetized by the act of 1873, but
the silver dollar was temporarily, and the de
monetisation was within the definition given
by Webster in his dictionary, his second defini
tion, "withdrawn from the currency."
Barleyâ Farmer, Petaluma. Cal. In 1888
the import of barley in the United States was
10,820,586 bushels, of the value of $8,028,979;
in 1891, 5,078,733 bushels. $3,222,593; ln
1892, 3,146,328 bushels, $1,592,040; in 1893,
1,970,129 bushels, $921.605 ; in 1894, 791,061
bushels. $358,744; in 1895, 2,116,816, value

The Bland Bill-W. F., City. The bill by
which the ailver dollar was remonetized, com
monly called the Bland bill, was passed In the
House Dv a vote of 164 ayes t0 34 noes, ninety
two members not voting. In the Senate it
passed by a vote of 48 to 21. After It had been
vetoed by President Hayes it was passed over
his veto by the following vote: In the House,
78 Republicans and 118 Democrats, against 52
Republicans and 21 Democrats; in the Senate,
by '22 Republicans and 24 Democrats, against
10 Republicans and 9 Democrats.
"Nothing New"â Subscriber, City. The cor
rect quotation is: "The thing that hath been,
it is that which shall be, and that which Is
done is that which shall be done, and there is
no new thing under the sun." It is to be
found in the Bible. Ecclesiastes 1:9. Bolomon
is commonly credited with the utterance of
this and other sayings taken from the same
canonical book of the Old Testament. The in
scription with which it commences is: "The
words of Kohelet [Hebrew lor preacher], the
son of David, King m Jerusalem." A number
of students of the Bible doubt tho authorship
.p.s being Solomon's.
Free Coinageâ E. E. O'D., City. It Is not
astonishing that at Democratic headquar
tors you should have been told that no
provision had been made to prevent, in case
of silver Democratic tucceu, foreign silver
from coming to the United States to be ex
changed for gold and that none was necessary,
as no foreign country hat any con*iderab.e
amount of silver to spare. That is the answer
given to deceive. The ratio in the rreat ma
jority of the foreign countries is 14 to 1.
There is no means of telling how much silver
England would be wiLiug to exchange for
American gold at any ratio should there be
unlimited free coinage.
Rkmonetization Actâ J. c. D.. Forest Ranch,
Cal. It was not silver but the itandard dollar
that was remonetized by the act of February
28, 1878. This act provided also for the pur- j
chase by the Secretary of the Treasury of sil
ver bullion at thÂ« market price of not less than
$2,000,000 or more than $4,000,000 worth per
month and cause the same to be coined
monthly as fust as purchased into dollars.
From 1878 to June 30, 1893, the amount of
silver dollars coined was $423,299,169. By
the act of 1896, November 1, the purchasing
clause as regards silver only was repealed; it
did not repeal the coinage of silver dollars.
Silver dollars are now being coined under in
! structions issued from the Treasury Depart
ment last January.

The officers of the Mining Bureau are at this
time collecting statistics with a view to ascer
taining how many gold and how many silver
mines there are In the State of California and
how many men are engaged in each, but the

approximate number oi either. This depart
ment might guess at the number, but will not.
Venus de Miloâ "Wahua," Los Angeles,
Cal. The "Venus Victorious" is called the

Husband and Wife and Lettersâ M. E. and
A., City. These correspondents ask about the
right to open letters. One asks: "Has the huÂ«
bnnd any right whatever to open his wife's
letter without her consent?" and the other
asks: "In case a husband deserts his wife and
she comes in possession ot a letter addressed to
him, has she a right to open that letter?" The
opening of a letter addressed to another is a
crime under the United States law, and is
punishable by fine and imprisonment. Sec
tion 7U3, paragraph 8, of the postal law says:
"Neither husband nor wife controls tne corre
spondence to the other; when so instructed a
Postmaster must refuse to deliver to the hus
band letters addressed to the wife, or to the
wife those adlressed to the husband. In the
absence of instructions to the contrary the
wife's letters should be placed in the hus
band's Dox and delivered to him with his own
letters unless they be known to live sepa
rately." The postal authorities say that while
it is generally understood that man and wife
are one, the Postal Department, in the matter
of letters, recognize them as two distinct Indi
vidual, nnd that, under a strict construction of
the law in the first case, the husband would
not have the right to open his wife's letters
without her consent, and in the second case if
a deserted wife received a letter addressed to
her husband, if she wished to avoid a prosecu
tion, she would return the letter to tie post
offlcc. "
Double Standardâ J. c. D., Foreit Ranch
Cal. The act of 1702 provided "that there
sha'l be from time to time struck and
coined at said mint coins of gold, silver and
copper, ot the following denomination*, values
and descriptions." Then follow the descrip
tions of eagles, half eagles and quarter eagles
of goid, "dollars or unitsâ each to be of the
value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same
is now current and to contain 371'^ grains of
pure or 416 grains of. standard silver, half dol
lars of hnlf of the value of the dollar unit"
after that there is a description of the
minor silver coins and the copper coiat. So
at first there was not oniy a double but a triple
standard in the United States. The relative
value of gold to silver was fixed at one part of
the former to fifteen of the latter, and the fine
ness ot gold coins was fixed at eleven parts of
pure gold to one of alloy. At the ratio named the
silver dollar being cheaper thau the gold dol
lar became the standard unit. The ratio in
most European countries was 1 to 15.5. The
gold imported in this country could be ex
changed for 15.98 parts silver which when ex
ported would yield one part of gold and
I leave a surplus of .48 parta silver as the
means to pay theexpenseof transportation,in
terest and still leave a profit on the transaction.
This led to a very large export of silver dollars,
and to check this President Jefferson
on the Ist of May, 1806, gave a per
emptory order to stop the coinage of silver
dollars and none were coined until 1830.
That was the first demonetization of the stan
dard dollar. The commercial ratio and the
coinage ratio did not coincide after 1795 and
the commercial rose until 1834, when it was
15.82 to 1. Then gold coin had a greater bul
lion value than coinage value and was ex
ported. In 1834 Congress to meet a general
preference for a gold circulation changed the
legal ratio between gold and silver to 1 to 16
by reducing the weight of gold in a gold dol
lar seven grains. Under that rating the
rold dollar became the standard unit.
Up to 1853 cold as well as sil
ver \vm coined free at the mint
for owners, but in that year a seigniorage was
placed on the coinages of silver, for while dol
lars were not coined the other silver coins
were. In 1873 the act of February 12 knocked
the standard dollar from the list of silver
coins, but by the act of June 20, 1874, all
silver coins, including the silver dollar, were
made a legal tender for payments not exceed
ing $5. By the act of February 28, 1878, the
silver dollar was remonetized and made "a
legal tender at its nominal value for all debta
and .dues, public and private, except where
otherwise stipulated in the contract." When
money is demonetized it is no longer a meas
ure of value.

Fendersâ P. C, East Oakland, Cal. There
have been Inventions calculated to automati
cally apply a brake on a streetcar when it
strikes an object, but as yet none has worked
satisfactorily. The cars of the Clay-street line
used auxiliary brakes that took the track, and
there was no objection to them. Fenders on
streetcars ought not to be more ttian two
inches Irom the groundâ so cay those who
have studied the subject.
Mossâ Mrs. J. E., City. The drying and press
ing of moss is an operation that requires pa
tience and practice to accomplish good results.
The moss which it is desired to preserve
should be placed in a large shallow pan con
taining water, so as to give the moss a chance
to spread. When all the brandies have been
well distended a sheet of cardboard or flat
piece of tin should be pushed under the ex
tended moss, so as to enable the operator to lift
it out of the water in the sh&pe in which it was
in the water. Then a sheet of blotting-paper
should be placed over the moss to absorb the
moisture. Alter that a sheet of heavy white
paper should be placed on the moss, the wbole
reversed, up as to enable the operator tore
move the cardboard or tin without disturbing
the shape of the moss. Then rub a sheet of
blotting-paper over what was the under side
and cover the moss wrth another sheet of
heavy white paper, place under a light weight
and expose to moderate heat from the sun
till dry.

Impossible to tell how much hydrogen would

YESTERDAY'S VOTE
AT THE PRIMARY
Inglorious Fate of the Con
test in the Thirty-
Sixth.
JACK M'CARTHY DOWNED
Four Men Knocked Hors de
Combat in the Fortieth
District
MARTIN KELLY'S BAD BLUFF.
He Asked for a Second Warrant for
tbe Ballots and Was Sat Down
Upon Very Rudely.
The primary election of the Republican
party passed off quietly in this City yester
day afternoon, there being but one oppo
sition ticket, and that in the Thirty-sixth
Assembly District, engineered by Jack
McCarthy, ex-poiiceman.
Mr. McCarthy did not pan out a good
engineer. He had been given two dele
gates to represent his uninteresting inter
ests, but Mr. McCarthy's ambition soared
higher. He wanted to crow on the top
roost and so he put up an opposition
ticket and last night there was nothing
left of him but the tail feathers.
There were many good men on his
ticket, but the fact that ambitious Jack
flew the track had a tendency to.dump
them into that political purgatory tfnown
as "the soup." Like the man who visited
the Bowery with more money than brains,
they will never go there any more.
The following was the McCarthy ticket:
Jack McCarthy. W. H. Murphy. J. Car
roll, Charles White, iÂ±. G. Foster, L. Sav
ace, Charles Duveneck, F. Crystal, James
Woods, J. Lorenz, H. Cieary, Robert
Thorp, Joseph Sheridan and C. H. Wedge
wood.
Club 1 in that district cast 1326
votes; Club 2 360 votes. In Club 1 the
reeular ticlcet received 726 votes and Mr.
McCarthy's ticket received 6. In Club 2,
McCarthy's stronghold, he received 258
votes to the regular's 102.
In the Fortieth District there occurred a
stirring incident. A quiet-iooking man
had cast his ballot for the regular ticket,
and had announced that fact rather con
spicuously in David Short's saloon, where
upon a stout man with a thick neck and v
red face reproved him. The voter smote
him on the terminal glare of his rubescent
proboscis and sat him bleeding on the
floor.
A friend stepped up and indignantly
protested. He received the blow in the
! right eye and sat down with an uphol
stered thud.
The third man approached the voter
and declared that such conduct was a
blank dashed shame. He was the re
cipient, as the society reporter would say,
in the left eye of the'fist of the voter, and
he broke a cuspidor with his left clavicle.
Then approached the third man. He
j deprecated war and advised arbitration.
! Just then a warclub made up of flesh and
i knuckles smote him on the kisser, and he
| fell raiher uneracelully, splitting the seat
of a chair with his chin.
The whole affair being politics, no ar
re*ta were made.
Early in the evening two emissaries of
Martin Kelly, boofiler and would-be boss,
appeared before Judge Campbell and de
manded a search-warrant for the ballots.
No reason beine given for this unusual
and illegal request, the Judge denied the
warrant.
It was simply a bluff, and showed the
desperate straits into which the fakers
have been driven.

delegates elected:

A BEAUTIFUL SERVICE.
Dedicatory Services Held lv St. Joseph's
Church Last Night.
St. Joseph's Church, on Tenth street,
near Howard, was filled from the doors to
the altar last evening. The occasion was
the mission given by the FLedemptorist
fathers of St. Louis, Father O'Shea and
Father Mullane.
The mission began a week ago and will
last turee weeks longer. The first week,

feeling upon the love that all should
have for the Blesse;l Virgin, the mother
of God. She, too, suffered all the pains of
mind and body that afflict the women of
modern times and, bavins suffered, can
feel for those who are in trouble.
Those who are In distress can and should
appeal to the Virgin who will intercede
with the Son.
At the conclusion about 500 younz girls
were dedicated to the Virgin, and, Father
Mullane requested that the little bouquet
of flowers tliat each carried be pressnted
at the shrine. The children presented a
very pretty picture in .their robes of pure
white.

HIS HONOR WAS ANGRY.
Justice Gro?z nger Gives a Money*
Lender an Oral Casti
gation.
Cbarles Ebn's Reward for Charging
io Per Cent a Month on
a Note.
A sad story was told in Justice
Groezinger's court yesterday, and the tell
ing resulted in Charles Elm, a money
lender, being thoroughly "roasted" by
the bsneh.
The defendant is Mrs. Rose Madero,
who, with her hve children, lives at 12^6
Green street. According to the testimony
one of her children fell sick several
months ago, and beinc without funds to
purchase the medicines and delicacies
needed (or the little one, she decided to
borrow money on her scanty furniture
and sent for Ehn.
The money-lender came, and after listen
ing to her sad tale, in which she related
the story of her dyine babe and of her
great need, he consented to loan her $50 if
she would give l.im a note secured by a
chattel mortgage. Mrs. Madero accom
panied him to a notary, and there, not be
ine able to read or write, affixed herX
mark to a note in which she agreed to pay
10 per cent a mouth for the use of $50 for
ninety days.
the also had to pay the notary's fees for
making out the mortgage and note. Ehn
told her that all she must do was to pay
$5 i>er month, which she supposed would
pay interest and principal, her knowledge
of ligures being very limited.
The next day her baby died.
Wiih the assistance of one of her little
girls, who earns 40 cents a day in a factory,
she managed to pay $40 in $5 driblets, and
then to her astonishment was served
with the papers in a suit to foreclose the
mortgage, J. J. Kauer being the assignee
of the claim.
When the case came up yesterday the
attorney for the defendant begged for a
continuance often days stating that his
client had managed to borrow $35 and
would pay that down and the balance
within the time specified or allow the
furniture to go without further protest.
Ebn entered a vigorous protest, but was
brought to a sudden halt by the Justice,
who had been looking over the papers.
"This is simply an outrage and one
that I uhall Lot allow to go unnoticed,''
he said. "It aDpears from this complaint
that the assignor here Ehn charged this
poor woman 10 per cent per month for the
loan of $50 and that he now, alter receiv
ing $40 of his claim, de&irea to take her
few little belongings from her.
"It is- simply barbarous and it Is the
greatest shame that the law does not pro
vide a severe penalty for such proceed
ings. It is worse than robbery.
"I shall give Mr 3. Madera' thirty days'
time instead of the ten as asked by her
attorney and no interest will be allowed
either. Any jury in the land would have
given her a verdict, but under the circum
stances I am sorry to say I cannot."

crowd as there was last evening. The
principal attraction was the exhibition
drill of the Veteran Firemen, who turned
out in full force to Bhow the people of to
day how they extinguished fires with the
old band-machine "Young America" in
years long gone.
The committee of arrangements con
sisted of the following veterans:
President Joseph F. Marshal, First Vice-Pres
ident Sleptien Bonner, Second Vice-President
George Barrilson, Third Vice-President \V. H.
Miller, Financial Secretary Gustav Poulmao,
Recording Secretary James Pennycoke, Treas
urer William Fahrenberg, Directors W. Rau
binger, Henry N. Kohn, Thomas Cornell. Al
Harris, Trustees F. A. Will, R. Harold and H.
J. Byrnes.
On Monday evening the Germans will
hold forth, the occasion beine known as
German night. Ail the German singing
societies in the City will be present, and
in tne grand choruses there will be 450
voices. Professor Franz Fischer will offi
ciate as leader. A special programme of
music has been rtrepared.
A quiet little flirtation that had been in
progress at one of the perfumery booths
was rudely spoiled yesterday afternoon
by the unexpected arrival of the ag
grieved wife on the scene. A well-to-do
appearing man, not very old and not very
young, hail been spending much time at a
booth in which was a young woman with
blue eyes and STrort blonde, curly hair.
He was leaning with a bicycle crook in
his back over the counter yesterday talk
ing to the charmer when the whack of an
umbrella acres* his spinal column caused
him to stand erect very suddenly. He
confronted a stoutly built, determined
looking woman who said: "So, sir; this is
the \? iy you worry your life away over
your business affair?, is it?"
The man looked desperately fooJish and
said: "Great Scott, Mary, don't make a
scene here. Let us go liome."
Thereis another small kick among some
of the exhibitors, and the trouble will
probably find its way into the Health De
partment. One of the local candy-dealers
has a concession to make and sell candy.
The discovery has been made that large
numbers of barrels marked "glucose,"
have been taken into the Pavilion und
made into candy.
The total vote to date on the most pop
nlar exhibit is as follows:
Johnsorj Locke Mercantile Company. 2390;
Joshua Hcinly Machine Works, "030; Crown
Flour Company, 1339; Rix Compressed Air
Mechine Company, 958; Tillmnnn & Bendel,

Light, heat and power, all the product
of electricity, are shown to excellent ad
vantage in the display of the Edison Light
and Power Company at the fair. A num
ber of novelties are introduced in tha ex
hibit, and the visitors to the fair from day
to day rind much that is interesting and
instructive in the company's display. The
one feature that perhaps attracts the
greatest attention and elicits the most
comment is the methods shown for utiliz
ing electric power for cooking and heat
ing puiposes. Advances are made *o
rapidly in all branches of electrical science
that it will probably not be a very gre:it
while before electricity will be used for
cooking and heating purposes to the same
extent that gas is at present, and ulti
mately it may displaco all manner of fuel.
It is only a* question of cost, and each
year sees new inventions introduced that
keep reducing the cost of producing elec
tric energy. The greatest uses to which
electricity has been successfully applied
thus far are in the production of light and
power, and the Edison Light and Power
Company has a plant that enables it
to furnish to the residents of San Fran
cisco ail the eiectric energy that may be
required for any purpose. Electricity is
being utilized for power purposes more
and more each your, and the results are in
every instance extremely satisfactory. It
can be furnished in any quantity desired,
from one horsepower upward. It is
cheaper than steam power and is also
much safer, and it is these two very im
portant factois that have been chiefly
responsible for the adoption in this City
to such a large extent of electricity for
motor purposes.
At to the use of electricity for light
ing purposes comment is unnecessary, for
people are well aware of the many novel
as well as useful advantages that elec
tricity possesses over all known forms of
illumination. For cooking purposes elec
tricity furnishes the means for fitting up
an ideal kitchen. There is entire a Dsence
of dirt or nmell. It can be turned off when
not in use, and as soon as the current is
turned on an intense heat is the instan
taneous result. It has everything to com
mend it, and the display at the fair will
perhaps be the means of causing many
people in this City to see the advantages
to be gained by the use of electricity for
cooking, a circumstance which would na
turally result in the installation of numer
ous eJectric kitchens.
Many visitors to the fair are probably
not aware that the display ma.le by thÂ«
Dairymen's Union of California is repre
sentative of one of the foremost industries
not alone of this State, but of the "United
States. The value of the dairy products
of the country each year are exceeued only
by the grain products, and therefore this
display is deserving of the greatest atten
tion. It is a magnificent exposition of
California's extensive dairy interests, and
in the display every county in the State is
represented. It is by far the finest and
most complete exhibit of the kind ever
made on tne coast, with the exception of
the display made by this same association
at the Midwinter Fair, where they received
the highest and special awards*on butter
and cheese. California creamery butter
has a reputation for excellence that is too
well established to require special men
tion. In the production of cheese Califor
nia now ranks with any of the Eastern
States, and it is due largely to the efforts
of the Dairymen's Union that such is the
case.
Great quantities of cheese are shown in
the disulay, and there is not a pound in
the entire lot that is not equal to the best
ever imported from the East. The center
of attraction of the exhibit ia a manimotn
cheese weighing 658 pounds. It is a j u u.
cream, made by the Cheddar process.
This it, a particularly delicious variety and
about all of this kind that is sold in this
market at present comes, from the East.
Tiie suciesa oi the Dairymen's Union in
the manufacture of this brand will enabie
them to supply the local demand and
thereby add materially to California's in
dustries. This display merits careful con
sideration on the part of visitors when
balloting for the best exhibit.
THREE SHOPLIFTERS.
The Police to Be .Employed in Running
Down Some Very Clever
Women Itogues.
For ten days past tne police have been
looking for three shoplifters who, it ap
pears, have managed to get away with
several hundred dollars' worth of goods.
Just how the scheme is worked is not
definitely explained, but that they have
worked successfully is admitted by the
parties mostly interested.
Nearly two weeks ago three women vis
ited the store of Davis Broa. and manaeed
to walk away with several articles of con
siderable value. They then turned their
attention to Hale Bros, and stole some
articles. Two or three times the trick
was turned, and then the proprietors
began to cast about for the guilty par
ties.
In the meantime other stores reported
similar losses, and the Retail Merchants'
Association held an indignation meeting.
It was determined to ask Chief Crowley to
appoint two special officers to visit the
various retail stores during each day, the
belief being that in this way the swind
lers would eventually be brought to jus
tice. The following gentlemen were
named as a committee to lay the matter
â¢before the Police Department : S. M. Levy,
J. 11. Martin, Samuel Weller and Leon
Samuels.
No special officers for the services re
quired have as yet been appointed by the
Police Department. In the meantime the
three mysterious women continue to get
in their work. It is said that during the
last few days they have visited several
KÂ«arny-street establishments, securing
plunder of no little value. They work
singly and in pairs, but never as a trio.
Only once have they been seen together,
and that was at Hale Bros. So clever is
their work, however, that no one has as
yet been able to catch them in the act of
stealing. â 
LUMBER ATTACHED.
The Local Stock of an Everett (Wash.)
Concern in the Hands of the
Sheriff.
The Bell Lumber Company, of Everett,
Wash., a corporation carrying a heavy
stock of lumber in this City, was attached
yesterday in a suit filed at the instance
of the Central Lumber Company of
California, having headquarters in this
City.
The Bell Company had big contracts
with the local concern, which it failed to
fulltil, and the suit for $2375 was the re
sult.
The Bank of Everett is belieyed to be a
creditor of the company to a heavy
amount and attachments on the concern's
mills at Everett are said to be almost cer
tain. Bishop A Wheeler are the attorneys
for the plaintiff.
Two Brothers Missing.
The police were notified yesterday of the
disappearance of Arthur ami Fred Otes from
their home, 261}^ Clementina street, last
Tuesday. They told other boys that they were
going to pick hops either at Fresno, Pleasan
ton or San Leandro. Arthur is 14 years of age
and Frtd two years vounser. Art&ur was
dressed in a new suit of dark clothes and took
bis old suit with him, while Fred had on a
shabby suit of dark ciotbes.
THIS SON WAS UNFILIAL
W. Cron Jr. Charged With
Having Defrauded- His
Father.
Induced Him to Sign a Quitclaim
Deed to His Property Unaer a
Misrepresentation.
William Cron, an old and well-known
German citizen, through his attorney,
Alfred Fuhrman, began suit yesterday
against his son, "William Cron jr., to re
cover property worth $20,000, which the
old man alleges his son secured from him
by fraud.
The old gentleman is 68 years of age and
only brought the suit against the son be
cause of having by the son's act been re
duced almost to want.
Cron was for many years engaged in the
butcher business, but, having amassed a
competency, retired several years ago.
He secured from James Boardman a lease
for twenty years of a lot in Oakland, upon
which he built a house, giving his son a
deed for a half-interest in the same. The
lease ana improvements were valued at
$20,000.
According to the complaint filed, the
son induced the old man to sign a paper
on the 13th of June. 1894, which he repre
sented to be a power of attorney in certain
li:isration he was then engaged in. The
paper was really a quitclaim deed to the
property, from the ownershiD of which
the old man has since been ousted, the
son claiming all the revenue.
The old man has been compelled to
open a small shop in South San Francisco
in order to make a living, and has finally
begun suit to recover his own.
Cron, the elder, has always been promi
nent among the German element and was
once t lie State grand president of the
ordor of Hermann Sons.

ATTORNEY COFFEY
KNOCKED OUT
Lawyer Noah F. Flood
Delivers the Violent
Blow.
POLICE COURT SCENE.
Coffey Was Addressing the Court
When the Assault Was
Made.
FLOOD PLACED UNDEE ARREST
Judge Campball Fined Him $100 for
Contempt aad Seat Him to Jail
for TwentvFour Eours-
Noah F. Flood, an attorney in the Par
rott building, created a scene in Judge
Campbell's court yesterday morning re
sulting in a fine of $100 being imposed
upon him and one daj-'s iniprisonm'ent in
the County Jail for contempt of court.
The case of Stephen Otis, stockbroker,
charged with felony embezzlement by
Mrs. Annie McManus, was being heard.
Attorney John J. Coffey represented Mrs.
McManus and he was on his feet address
ing the court when Flood came in. Flood
walked along till he reached where Mr.
Otis was seated. He whispered something
in Mr. Otis' ear nnd the stockbroker
pushed him away. Flood then addressed
the cr>urt, saying: "There's going to be a
knockout in this case."
The Judge thinking that he might have
been called into the case and imagining
that Flood meant to spring a motion to
brine the matter to a sudden close waited
lor Flood to proceed.
Coffey bad wheeled around and was
looking at Flood in a surprised way when
Flood shot out his right fist and struck
Coffey a violent blow in the face, which
staggered him and soon raised a lump
around his rignt eye.
A sxene of wild confusion enstred, but
the Judge promptly restored order. Flood,
who had evidently been drinking, realized
that he bad made a mistake and did not
attempt to repeat the assault.
"I will fine you $100 for contempt of
court," said the Judge to Flood, "and
order that you be imprisoned in the
County Jail for twenty-lour hours. Your
conduct is disgraceful. Take him away."
Policeman Coughlin and Deputy Bailiff ,
Harris grabbed hold of Flood and he
struggled fiercely to get away from them. '
In the struggle Flood was thrown to the
floor. He was jacked up and escorted out-
Bid* the courtroom, where Poiiceman
Fleming held him till Couehlin got his
hat. Flood tried to get back into thn
courtroom and Fleming had all he could
do to restrain him.
All the way to the City Prison Flood !
was abusive in his languace to CouÃhlin,
and in prison he struck at him twice
while being searched, but Coughlin evaded
the blows.
After Fiood had left the courtroom Cof
fey apologized to the court for beinpr an
innocent party to such a disgraceful scene.
Out of respect to the court he did not
return the blow, but he was determined to
make Flood suffer for the indignity.
Coffey swore to a complaint charging

ASSEMBLED VOTERS DISPLAY
ENTHUSIASM.
William A- Bowden, a Life-Loug
Democrat, Presides Over the
Gathering.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 19.â An immense
Republican mass-meeting was held in this
city this evening. Hon. Morris M. Estee,
the orator of the occasion, was escorted to
Hale's Hall by the uniformed Flambeau
:orps of the Santa Clara County Republi
can League and a delegation from the col
ored McKinley Republican Club of this
city. The crowd along the line of march
was enthusiastic and there were frequent
bursts of applause. The members of the
Flambeau Club, which is known as the
McKinley Battalion, made a fine appear
ance and went through many neat mili
tary evolutions in a masterly manner.
Hon. M. M. Estee replied to the mis
statements made recently by Senator
Stephen M. White in a speech in this city.
The speaker made numerous telling points
and his address was frequently interrupted
by applause.
The great demonstration of the evening
wa? when William A. Bowden. a life-long
Democrat and Democratic candidate for
District Attorney two years ago, was in
troduced as charman of the meeting. As
the convert came upon the stage there
was long continued applause, followed by
three cheers for the chairman. Mr. Bow
den made a brief address, in which he
said:
Fellow-citizens, both Democrats and Re
publicans : 1 am not accustomed to addressing
niass-ineeUngs of Republicans. I have for
v*>ars past been on the other side, bnt I have
reformed. It is usually a difficult thing for a.
iriim to >ever old connections. It is hard to
st.'c that the party to wiich he has become at
tached is for another and an obnoxious cause.
The reflecting citizen, whether man or
woman â and I think in this campaign the
women must be consideredâ will agree with
me that the man who has worked withaparty
in defeat and victory becomes Attached to its
name, and it is hard to break from it; when a
man takes that step it should be when lie has
sutufied hinixelf that unusual danger threat
ens the country.
That danger now confronts every man and
every woman who have hitherto placed their
faith in the Democratic party. The Chicago
platform repudiates all good Democratic prin
ciples and all good Republican principles.
It goes back on all principles of a republi
can form of Government. All that it offers is
hope, and people cannot live on that. The Re
publican standard-bearers and Republican
principles give you something which no man
or party can repudiate.
I believe that my sentiments are those of
most of the Democrats of Santa Clara County.
Good consistent citizens, Democrats and Re
publicans alike, are bound to view this situa
tion as intelligent citizens should view it. I
am satisfied that they will do this, and that
the votes of the farmer, the workingman and
the business man will be cast for the apostle
of protectionâ William McKinley of Ohio.
It is now my pleasure and pride as a con
vert to Republicans to present to you, not a
gentleman irom San Francisco, Los Angeles,
San Jose or any other section, but Hon. Morris
M. Estee of California.
.Mr. Estee was greeted with prolonged
cheers. He said in part:
Senator White makes mv financial speeches
the feature of his efforts. I feel congratu
lated; he compliments me overmuch. He
quotes from a speech I made a year or two ago
in this city. The first quotation so made by
the Senator is as j allows: "That people which
has the largest amount of good money in
circulation has the most potential instrument
of trade and commerce, and consequently is
the most prosperous. That is so because all
the values of property are fixed by money,
and when there is a good deal of money in
circulation property sells at a better price
than when there is little." That is good doc
trine. I believe every word of it, and I have
yet to see the Republican, or any other honest
man, who does not believe it. If there is any
one who is not in favor of the largest amount
of good money, outside of Senator White's
party, I want to see him. The trouble is that
if Senator White's party does not want the
largest amount oi good money then they must
want the largest amount of bad money, for
tl:ey always want money. I challenge the
Senator, aud I challenge ail other Popocrats,
to find one word that I have ever said, to find
one expression in any Republican platform,
State or National, that did not and does not
favor good money ana the largest possible
amount of it.
The Senator was so pleased with the result
of his first quotation from my speech that be
proceeded to quote further from me, and did
so for fully half an hour. His next quotation
reads as follows: "It being admitted that an
abundance of good money is beneficial, and
that there is a great deal of silver money in
use we next inquire, 'Is silver a good money?'
The answer is, There is not enough gold money
in circulation to carry on business and to sus
t*in public and private credit and to maintain
the prices of products, and so we must have
silver.' "
Every word of that is true. But our friend
Senator White did not tell you that when
we commence coining both foreign and
American silver free that it will not be good
money, and that it will not circulate. He
would open our mints to the foreign silver, as
he and his party have opened our ports and
our markets to the products of foreign cheap
labor, and thus destroy the value of American
silver, as he and his party have destroyed the
products of American labor. It goes without
saying that an abundance of good money is
beneficial to v country or to a man who pos
sesses it. This is too plain a proposition lo in
spire a doubt. American silver is good money
now, but it will be worthless money when we
coin Chinese ana Indian silver free and in un
limited amounts.
We now have in round numbers .$600,000,
-000 in gold and we have a littie over #(500,
-000,000 in silver, every dollar of which is in
terchangeable for a dollar of gold; aud we
have also many hundreds of millions of paper
money, every dollar of which is interchange
able for a dollar of gold or a dollar of silver
money, and so long as the parity of value of
American paper.gold and silver money remains
then American silver, gold and "paper money
will continue to be good mone*-. But when
ever you open the doors of American mints to
the unlimited coinage oi both American and
foreign silver, at a time when that silver is
worth but 53 cents on the dollar, you will not
only bankrupt the Nation, but you will bank
rupt every man who has a dollar to lose, or
who hopes to earn a dollar by his toil, because
silver money will not then have a purchasing
value, and by reason of its cheapness it will
drive all other money out of use and we will
nave silver monometallism.
Allow me to quote briefly irom part of that
silver speech of mine which Mr. White and
whict his party neglected to quote. I would
not do this but for the reason that the Senator
would make it appear that we had changed
our views on the silver question. What we do
say is: That since Mr. White and his party
have destroyed our industries we must restore
confidence before we can have pro:-perity;
that we cannot restore confidence by making
cheaper money, and paying gold debte in sil
ver; 'that we are now confronted with new
conditions; that we cannot now usÂ« the money
we have; that the party that has destroyed
our industries will also destroy our financial
system if they get a chauce; that free trade
linked with free silver is no remedy for the
present hard times, and will result in national
Bankruptcy. We are opposed to silver or gold
monometallism. We believe that the free
and unlimited coinage of silver is not now an
adequate remedy for the hard times caused by
the Democratic tariff legislation.
That for the country to be prosperous our
exports should exceed our imports, and our
foreign Indebtedness would thus be paid by
our foreign balances, and American money
would then remain at homo. That we must
set labor to work at fair wages. That to do
this we must fire up the furnaces in our mills,
start the wheels ot cur machinery, protect
products of the farm ana maintain our home
markets against unfair foreign competition.
When we do this we will have good times, and
with good times will come a larger use ior
money, and then confidence will be restored,
and all this will result from protection.
Senator White is altogether the ablest among
the Popocratic speakers now traveling through
the State. He represents that party and its
policy more than any other man. Six months
ago be was a Democrat. He was then for free
trade only. He voted for the Wilson bill and
%cc raw material. He is vow for free silver
and free trade. He then adored Cleveland,
and he now opposes him. Up to the day of tne
adjournment of the Senate in June of this
year, he sustained Mr. Cleveland and his ad
ministration, gold bonds, gold policy and all.
He was on the Finance Committee of the
Senate and he did not even object to the issue
of gold bonds, although he had an opportunity
to do so. He now indorses the platform which
claims to oppose their issuance and is in favor
of paying them in silver. Up to the time of
the adjournment of Congress ho was the main
support, the bulwark of Cleveland's adminis
tration. Cleveland was a gold monometallist
and opposed to silver in every form; he knew
it when he supported him for President and
ever since then.
Ido not blame White. He was a Democratic
SenHtor; that is reason enough for his action.
Indeed, Senator White has for years looked on
complacently and silently at the wreck of a Na
tion's industries. That was the inevitable result
of his political principle?. He never once raised
his voice in the people's defense. He saw the
fÂ»eople growing poorer and poorer; he saw the
aborers out of employment; he saw the Na
tion running into debt; property decrease in
value; the factories closed down; the products
of the farm and the farms themselves lowered
33 per cent in value and 42 per Cent of Ameri
can workers out of employment; and his ouly
answer was his affirmative vote on thtf Wilson
bill and free trade.
Four ye.irs ago it was my privilege to speak
with Senator White on the tariff issue. He
then told you, and he told the people every
where, if we adopted the Democratic prin
ciple of tariff reform and put raw material on
the free list, we would prosper. His whole
argument was made upon the theory that
"protection was a fraud." The Democratic
platform so declared, and he indorsed that
declaration. He demanded free raw material,
free wool, free truit, free grain and cheap for
eign goods. He told the laboring man that
American labor could take care of itself. That
is what he now says about American finances.
And he said in so many words, "American
laborers could do one-third more work than
any other people," a,nd thus he argued If they
would only work harder they would be all
right; that we did not need protection. And
he said to the people, after admitting our
prosperity, that "we had prospered in spite
of protection." At that tjme I told you if the
Senator's theories of government were carried
out ruin would fall upon our country; that
the value of labor would b? lowered ; that the
price of products would be largely decreased ;
that money would become scarce; that the
poor would be the chief sufferers, and, in a
word, that protection would alone secure
American prosperity, and free trade would re
sult in American ruin.
What I said has proved true. My friend
White now admits that he was wrong in the
past because he now refuses to sustain the ad
ministration he helped to elect. After failing
in his promise of four years ago he hunts up
the silver question, with the addenda of repudi
ation and the Chicago platform, although for
four years he has sustained a gold Democratic
administration and never once complained.
He never mentions protection or iree trade
| now. He groposes to remedy present con
j ditions by coining free â either Chinese or
: American â silver. He forgets the prorai*--s of
! the past. He intimates, without saying it,
: that ne was young and inexperienced then.
i He is four years older and many years wiser
now. He was then for Cleveland and reform.
! He is United States senator aud of right can
change his principles to suit his following. I
jdo not blame him lor that. He wants another
{ term in the Senate. I think he is sincere. He
! knows his political principles have been bad
and his party associations worse, and if he
does not likehis party why shouldn't he leave
it t Biit it looks a little suspicious for a states
mnn to cry, "Stop, tiiief!" to everybody else
; while he is getting away with the plunder. In
! this instance the plunder is the offices. Ido
! not mean this as a criticism, but simply as a
\ historical fact.
The Senator has an idea to the main chance,
and po he combines with Mr. Cator, the Pop
ulistic cai.dulate for the Senate, at the same
time that he changes his politics and saves
the finances of the country. Cator & White,
White & Catorâ twin relics of old parties.
This is the programme: Cator is to have all
the Democratic Assemblymen this year, White
the hold-ovet Senators next year and the peo
ple a few of the Superior Judges. The marvel
is that the people get anything under this ar
rangement.
The people can see how our friends are sav
ing the country. I don't blame them for be
ing ambitious, but what 1 do blame them for
is that they should imperil tne peace of so
ciety, the industries of the country and the
honor of the American name to if-atify their
political ambition. I like White and I do
think by reason of his extreme youth he has
been led into this unfortunate alliance.
Observe the situation : The following circu
lar letter sent out to the good people of the
State explains itself. I quote from the Exam
iner of Sunday morning, September 13,
1896. The Examiner says the following is a
sample copy of these letters that Mr. Cator has
been sending out:
San Francisco, Sept. 9, 1896.
My Dear Sir: There are Assemblymen and
Superior Judges to be elected in L'ouuty.
The Democrats generally are giving us the Assem
blymen for the Supeiior Judges, and they are sat
isfied with my contest tor Senator, in view of my
long services for the cause of silver. Last night
you were elected a member of the Stat silver
Campaign Committee of California. It would be
agreeable to that entire committee, as well as to
the Democrats generally, if you would make this
arrangement.
I leave for Bakprsfield to-Dight, and hope to
learn on my return that you have used your good
offices in this matter. Very sincerely,
Thomas V. Catob.
We repeat, Mr. Cator is the Populistic candi
date for the Senate this year; he wants the As
semblymen. Senator White is to be the candi
date for Senator two years from now; he wants
the hold-over Senators; the people are not in
it. This is a most pleasing free-silver arrange
ment, but to the suffering producers it would
seem to be more for free offices than for free
silver. It is an attractive combination for
the two candidates for the Senate. A thought
ful man might well inquire, "How will this
benefit the people?" Both gentlemen are
free-traders, both for free silver and both for
free offices. There is success in this arrange
menttothem, but poverty and want to the
people.
The only thing now necessary for these
worthy gentlemen to do to make easy sailing
Is to so attract public attention by pointing
out how bad the wicked Republicans are that
no one will notice their own shortcomings
They at least are inconsistent.
The remainder of Mr. Estee's speech
embraced a logical presention of Republi
can arguments for protection and an
honest currency.

SALT LAKE'S FUCK CONVENTIONS.
Free-for-All Fight in a Gathering of
Silrer J>rpubllcans.
SALT LAKE. Utah, Sept 19.â This
was a day of conventions in this city, no
fewer than four being held â two Republi
can, one Democratic ana one Populist.
The latter two were for the nomination of
county officers and passed off quietly.
One of the Republican conventions was to
elect delegates to the McKinley Republi
can State Convention, to be held on Sep
tember 28, and the other to name dele
gates to the Silver Republican Conven
tion. This gathering was an exceedingly
lively affair. The committee on resolu
tions brought in two reports. The ma
jority recommended that the delegates
elected on Friday by the independent or
third wing of the Republicans be chosen
as delegates to the Silver Republican Con
vention and the minority's report recom
mended that the convention proceed to
elect deleeates in the usual manner.
This precipitated a fiefht on the adoption
of the reports and for a while pandemo
nium reigned. Ardent silver men jumped^
onto the platform and seizing a large por
trait of Major McKinley which adorned
the chairman's table, proceeded to tear it
to pieces. The McKinley followers rushed
to the rescue of the picture and a free
light followed, which the serjeants-at
arms were powerless to stop. Finally
some of the ringleaders were ejected from
the hall and peace was restored. The mi
nority report was adopted by a large ma
jority and the business of electing dele
gates proceeded without interruption.

PERKINS AT DOLLISTER.
Dwells Upon Finance and the Need of
Protection,
HOLLISTER. Cal., Sept. 19.â Senator
Perkins opened the campaign in San
Benito County this evening, addressing
the largest political gathering ever held in
Hollister. The Opera-house was full to
overflowing and the Senator nad the at
tention ol his audience to the end.
He invited criticisms of his record in the
Senate upon silver or any other question,
promising to freely answer. He believed
in returning an account of his steward
ship.
Senator Perkins' remarks were devoted
to a full exposition of the financial ques
tion and the necessity of protecti^fc legis
lation, and closed with an appeal to the
young men to cast their first vote with the

SENTIMENT AT STANFORD.
Ten Educators Favor McKinley to One
for Bryan.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
19. â Professor J. C. Branner, the head of
the geological department here, has con
cluded a rather interesting bit of political
statistical work. Being interested in the
campaign from a specialist' 3 point of view,
he was desirous of ascertaining the true
feeling of the Stanford faculty on the
money question. The result of the can
vass resulted as follows: For McKinley
60, Bryan 6, undecided 7, unknown 5.
Those favoring McKinley number all the
heads of the departments, with but one
exception, that of a professor from Ne
braska, who votes for Bryan for personal
reasons, and not because he is a believer
in cheap money. The nnmber includes
President Jordan, ex-President Harrison,
Professor Andrew D. White and Dr. Amos
G. Warner, head of the department of
economics.
Of the six for Bryan it has already been
mentioned that one will vote for him on
personal grounds. Another gives similar
reasons. He is an old acquaintance of
Bryan's and while a believer in sound
money will vote for the Popocratic nomi
nee in remembrance of past friendship.
Professor Branner has always been a
Democrat and is a believer m the free
trade doctrine, but he is convinced that
the money plank of the Chicago conven
tion is absolutely wrong, so he will cast his
vote for McKinley, believing that is the
only way to be true to the best and most
important interests of the country. Dr.
Branner says this is true of a number of
his colleagues. Of the seven doubtful ones
a majority have hitherto voted for Dem
ocratic nominees, but their adherence has
been shaken by the platform adopted by
the silver Democrats, and they are con
sidering the advisability of voting for Mc-
Kinley on election day. It will be seen
that at the least tne vote of the Stanford
faculty stands more than ten to one in
favor of William McKinley of Ohio, and
that the men who think most on such
questions are the ones who are over
whelmingly in favor of the proposed Re
publican money policy.
STOCKTON'S CAMPAIGN OPENS.
Masonic Hall Crowded by Enthusiastic
. Republicans.
STOCKTON, Cal.. Sept. 19.â The Re
publicans opened the local campaign to
night with a monster meeting in Masonic
Hall. From 7 o'clock until a late hour
bonfires burned on the plaza and bombs
and anvils were fired.
It was planned to hold the meeting on
the plaza, but the inclement weather pre
vented, and so Masonic Hall was secured.
Long before the hour of the opening the
galleries were packed, and before 8 o'clock
there was not a seat to be obtained on the
ground floor.
The speakers were Hon. R. P. Carpenter
and E. S. Lippett. The McKinley Club of
thia city, headed by a band, marched
from the depot through the principal
thoroughfares in torchlight procession,
the first political parade that has been
seen in Stockton.
In the line of march were some of
Stockton's foremost citizens. They did
not shout, but they were an earnest lot.
When they arrived at the hall it was
filled and it was hard work for the mem
bers of the McKinley club to find seats.
M. S. Thresher was chairman of the
meeting and Dr. C. L. Ruggles introduced
Senator Carpenter as the principal speaker
of the evening. His address was enthu
siastically received. Back of the stage
were draped the stars and stripes, on
which were written the call, "Vote for the
eleventh amendment." Miss Susan B.
Anthony Bpoke for some time on this
amendment, which will come before the
voters of California next November.
DARRIS AT PASAD ENA.
The Sound- Money l>emocrat Addresses a
Large Gathering.
PASADENA, Cal., Sept. 19.â A McKin
lev meeting of especial interest was held
this evenine at the Republican Wigwam.
Tlie principal address was delivered by
W. A. Harris, a prominent attorney of
Los Angeles and a life-long Democrat,
who made a stirring and eloquent appeal
for sound money.
The occasion was further notable as the
Americus Club made its first public ap
pearance, wearing new uniforms of strik
ing beauty. A procession that passed
along the business streets was headed by
the Pasadena band and the Americus
Club drum and fife corps. This club is the
only organization of the kind in Southern
California, and the uniforms are pictur
esque, being of white duck, trousers,
jackets and caps trimmed in yellow and
yel.ow leggings. The "boys" "are 100 in
number.

ORANGE. Cal.. Sept 19.â 1t was an
earnest meeting that James 6. Gray,
president of the McKinley and Hobart
Club, called to order last evening, when
patriotism, protection and prosperity
were expounded. The attendance was
larce, and nearly every shade of political
belief was represented. Addresses were
made by J. W- Ballard, Republican nomi
nee for Superior Judge of this county, and
E. E. Keech, who for several past cam
paigns hns been the Prombition nominee
for District Attorney, both residents of
Santa Ana.
During his speech Ballard said that we
had a financial system as good as any on
earth and should keep it. If we had any
thing to sell and the people wanted it,
there was money enough to buy it with.
He quoted Stephen M. White as having
said that free coinage of silver was an ex
periment and he was not sure of its out
come. Keech said that if free coinage of
silver was adopted every contract made
would come down to the " bullion value of
the metals, and there would be a gold
value and a silver value.

McCARTHY'S CASE
AT LOS ANGELES
San Quentin Yawns for
the Would-Be Bank-
Robber.
PROOF OF HIS GUILT.
A Confederate Tells in Court
the Whole Story of the
Conspiracy.
THE PRISONER TURNS LIVID.
Held to Answer for His Tunneling
Operations, With Bail Fixed
at $5000.
Los Angeles Office of The Call,)
328 South Broadway. V
Los Angeles, Cal., Sept. 19.)
The friends of John J. McCarthy, re
cently arrested on a Post-street car in San
Francisco for complicity in the famous
tunnel scheme to loot the vaults of the
First National Bank of this city, may as
well prepare to bid that gentleman a
"tearful adieu" for a season. After the
testimony of Fred L. Jones here to-day in
McCarthy's preliminary examination
there is no question but what the ex
pugilist is headed for San Quentin. For
once it seems the police and detective
force of this city were strictly correct in
asserting soon after McCarthy's arrest
that they had the ringleader in the tunnel
scheme and Jones has confirmed this "tip"
in detail.
A rumor had gone abroad that the prose
cution was to spring a sensation to-day,
and, therefore, Justice Morrison's court
was packed almost to the point of suffoca
tion. At the close of President Elliott's
testimony as to what he had found be
neath his bank's vaults, Deputy District
Attorney Williams in clear cold tones
said, "Bring in Fred L. Jones."
Jones is the saloon-keeper who con
ducted the "Spokane" saloon at the cor
ner of Commercial and Los Angeles
streets, which afforded the blind for the
operations of the tunnelers. As Jones
took the witness-chair McCarthy turned a
livid white, shook like a leaf and glared at
Jones, who sat only about six feet from
him.
Prosecutor Williams, after asking the
witness his name, age and place of resi
dence, put this question to him, "Do you
know anything about the digging of a
tunnel from the cellar of your saloon
under the vaults of the First National
Bank?"
"I do," replied Jones very coolly, as he
returned the savage glare of McCarthy
with a look of indifference.
The attorneys for the defense raised the
question of his having been offered in
ducements by the officers to make the
statement which he now seemed willing
to volunteer.
The court finally overruled the motion
of the defendant to exclude the testimony
of Jones and the witness was Instructed to
answer the questions put by the prosecu
tion.
"I met the defendant, John J. Mc-
Carthy, about one year ago. He came into
my place quite frequently and we soon
became friendly. Along in November,
1895, he first broached the subject of rob
bing the First National Bank. I was
about to close the saloon when we went
into a private room. He told me that he
had a scheme on foot which would net me
from $20,000 to $30,000. He said that all
that be wanted was the use of my cellar.
He said that there were a lot "of food
people in the scheme, claiming that one of
the men was employed in the bank, as well
as the owner of the building, and two good
attorneys who would stand by them in the
case of any trouble.
"I finally told them to go ahead. The
work was done principally at night after I
had closed up the saloon. All I knew be
sides McCarthy were Tom Campbell, Jim
Stevens and Jack Stewart. There were
others but I do not know their names."
After Jones' statement the officers
brought in the tools, consisting of picks,
grap-irons, shovels, chisels, two jack
screws, derricks, ropes, etc., which Jones
identified and stated tnat they were all
brought to his place by McCarthy and
Tom Campbell.
McCarthy was held to the Superior
Court with bail fixed at $5000.
GERMAN METHODISTS MEET.
Annual Conference Begins Its Seas ton at
Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept 19.â The an
nual California conference of the German
Methodist Episcopal Church was opened
in the German M. E. Church on Fourth
street this morning. The first half hour
of the session was devoted to relizious ser
vices, led by Rev. H. Brueck of Oakland.
Bishop Foss was to have been the presid
ing officer, but owing to his indisposition
Rev. George Guth presided.
Reports from the committees on educa
tion, orphange asylums, Bible cause, mis
sions, temperance and tract cause were re
ceived and adopted. Dr. Thompson of the
American Bible Society was introduced
to and addressed the conference. A num
ber of ministers from this city and vicinity,
who were visitors at the meeting, were in
troduced.
Librarian Howird Missing.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 19.â Frank
Howard, law librarian of this city, a
well-known attorney, bade his wife and
children an affectionate good-by several
weeks ago and started on a trip to some
mines in San Bernardino County. Bince
then nothing has Deen heard of him, not
withstanding the fact that he is overdue
on his return long ago. His continued ab
sence and strange silence have naturally
caused the gravest apprehension on the
part of his wife, who confidently believes
that he has either met with foul play or a
fatal accident. In this emergency Sirs.
Howard gladly accepted the kindly offices
of a mining man, who is well acquainted
with the various mining districts of San
Bernardino County, and who started out
yesterday in search of the missing man.
FOR ESRVILLE FATALITY.
Lester Holloway of I'rtatuna Killed by
Hia Jtunaway 'leant.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Sept. 19.â 8y a
runaway accident near Foresiville yester
day Lester Holloway of Petalnma was al
most instantly killed. The Holloway
family were on their way to the Lester
ranch, the deceased being in a wagon and
his mother and sister preceding him in a
buggy. His team became unmanageable
in going down a steep hill, and he at
once called to the occupants of the buggy
to get out of the way, which they suc
ceeded in doing. At the foot of the hill
the wacon-tongue broke, throwing the
young man to the ground with great force.
He was greatly bruised and injured and
died in the presence of his agonized
mother and sisters. He was a former resi
dent of Cloverdale and Guernevilie, aged
25 years and unmarried.

WML ,
RADAM'S
MICROBE
KILLER.
Most Truly and Correctly Called
The Greatest Medicine
in the World.
A Wonderful Tonic and
Blood Purifier.
Although the world hes long sustained a
great "learned profession," whose special
function has been the cure of Human Disease,
there still exists a list of diseases termed "in-
curable" by "the faculty." CONSUMPTION,
CANCER, LEPROSY, SOFTENING OF THE
BRAIN, DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS AND
HEART and certain others have defied the
pharmacopeia of the world and the skill of an
educated and trained profession, and have
continued to hurry their victims to premature
1 death.
Intelligent thinkers of modern times and
students of nature have recently become con-
vinced that a cure would ere long be found
for diseases hitherto considered incurable.
This anticipation has now been realized, and
Wm. Radam's Microbe Killer deprives Scrof-
ula, Consumption, Cancer, Leprosy, Gout,
Bright's Disease and Rheumatism, and all so-
called incurable diseases, of their terrors.
Thousands of sufferers who were regarded as
past hope have, by its use, been restored to
, health.
The marvelous curative power of Micbobb
i Killer has been incontestable proved, and a
large number of persons in this country have
in many cases been literally snatched from
the jaws of death and restored to the enjoy-
ment of healthy life, and they have gratefully
acknowledged the completeness of their cures
in the testimonials which they have civen.
Professor Tyndall, M. Pasteur and the most
eminent savants of the age agree, and it is
proved conclusively by the aid of the micro-
scope, that all diseases, no matter by what
name they may be : known, are caused by an
unhealthy condition of the blood. This unhealthy
condition arises from%n Invasion or infection
of the blood by living germs. Microbes,
Germs and Bacteria are the generating and
sustaining cause of all kinds of illness preva-
lent among our race. Professor Tyndall and
M. Pasteur advanced the theory that a pana-
cea for all disease would be found in the dis-
covery of an agent which, while being harm-
less to the human system, would be destruc-
tive to the animate germs of disease in other
words, would be a "man saver" by being a
"Microbe Killer." Such a panacea has now
been discovered by Wm. Radam and is known
as Wm. Radam's Microbe Killer.
The discovery is the outcome of a series of
scientific investigations, and its Microbe-
killing property may be iucontrovertibly dem-
onstrated by experiments.
Infection is generally conveyed through the
medium of Impure air, bad water, improper
food or by contact with persons already dis-
eased. The remedy must be a thorough blood-
purifier. It may be said "There are hundreds
of so-called blood-purifiers, and because they
have been found of little avail new blood-
puri/iers are continually being offered, and
impose upon a credulous public ever and
anon." There are also many remedies for
external use only, all claiming to purify the
blood. Some are electric, others galvanic;
some are more simple, for instance a mustard
plaster, and of all these the last is the most
efficacious. If any one of these bad been
really curative It would have superseded all
others, but all, after a short season of notoriety,
fall into disuse. A blood-purifier which will
succeed where all others have failed must be
one that will, without harm to the patient,
destroy the living germs or septic matter in
the blood, commonly called Microbes. Other
venders of remedial agents may claim to do
this, but we will- prove that they do not. A
perfect antiseptic or blood-purifier must be
able to destroy corruption, suppuration, infec-
tion, etc., by external as well as Internal use,
and as all blood or skin diseases arise from
impurity of the blood itself, an antiseptic must
be found that may be used internally with
success, and also externally. Can this test be
applied to any of these so-called blood-puri-
fiers ? Try them; apply them to wounds, cuts,
bruises, burns or old running sores. The utter
fallacy will then be seen of trying to purify
the blood by remedies (whether they be
liquids, powders or other nostrums) which are
incapable of destroying the septic or living
matter if applied externally.
Wm. Radam's Microbe Killer is a thorough
blood-purifier because it is a true antiseptic.
We have incontrovertible proofs in the testi-
monials .from thousands of patients, many
from prominent Individuals, including both
sexes. The same remedy used externally will
destroy all corruption to be found in skin
diseases, being as powerful in its action as
carbolic acid or any other antiseptic prescribed
by the medical profession for external use
only, and yet you may freely drink this remedy
with perfect safety (the smallest infant may
take it), and thus cure yourself by striking at
the root of disease by destroying the impure,
fermented living matter in the blood. Nine
years' experience has proved that- we possess
A GENUINE MICROBE-KILLER.
Try it and you will find our claim to be
amply justified. Call in person or write for
advice regarding . your case. We will cheer-
fully furnish you, free of charge, with the
fullest information. Young and old of either
sex need not hesitate to inquire into the merits
of a remedy possessing the undoubted power
to relieve them from further suffering. No
matter by what name your disease be called,
Microbes cause it, and Microbe Killer will
kill the cause, and therefore cure the disease.
WOMEN
Ailing with troubles peculiar to their sex
should write to us with full particulars. We
will give you all necessary advice.
WE CHARGE NOTHING FOR
CONSULTATION.
MEN
Afflicted with any Private Disease or Disorder
of the Blood should also communicate with us.

And of All Druggists.The Pacific Mail Company's Steamer Gty of Peking, as She Appeared After Coming Off the Drydock. The Peking Came Here Over Twenty Years Ago, and Is Still One of the
Best That Comes to This Port. The Officers Aj-e Proud of Their Ship, and Some of Them Have Been in Her a Lifetime.

A HANDSOME AND
STATELY VESSEL
The City of Peking, the
Largest Steamer on
This Coast.
BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL.
After Twenty-Five Years o!
Service She Is Still as
Good as Ever
SINKING OF A SMALL STEAMER.
The Ethel and Marion Went Down
Owin? to Carelessness of
tbe Engineer.
The handÂ«omest and largest steamer in
port is the Pacific Mail Company's City of
Peking. She came here from Chester,
Pa., nearly twenty-five years ago, and has
been continuously in the Oriental trade
ever since. Not a steamer that trades in
and oat of San Francisco has met witn
fewer mishaps than the Peking during her
Ion? and busy career. She is 5079.62 tons
gross burden, 408 feet long, 47 feet broad
and 19 feet 5 Inches deep. Her passenger
accommodation is of the finest, and her
carrying capacity is greater tnan that of
any passenger steamer Uat has visited
the coast.
Among the officers of the Peking, Chief
Engineer William McClure is the oldest
in point of service. He has been sixteen
years on the steamer continuously, and is
one of the most trusted employes of the
Pacific Mail. When the Peking broke
down some years ago on her way here
from Chiaa, McClure and bis men did
yeomen's work in the repairing of the
broken shaft. Their efforts were a.i in
vain, but machinists assert still that it
was one of the cleverest attempts at re
pairs in the circumstances ever made on
vhÂ» Pacific.
Captain J. Tremain Smith is a new com
mander on the Peking. Chief Officer G.
G. Trask took the vessel over to Hong Kong
last December, and there Captain Smith
assumed command. Since then be nas
made bimself a favorite with the traveling
public and the officers of his crew.
Chief Officer Trask Is an old master mar
iner and is well known on the coast- He
is one of the best disciplinarians in Cali
fornia, and he always has his crew well in
hand.
Purser E. T. Osborn has grown up in
the service of tne Mail Company, and
from freight clerk on ihe wharf has grad
ually worked himself up to the important
position he now holds. All in all, the
Peking i 3 one of the best officered and
best found su pa in port.
The tvs; Etnel and Marion met with an
other mishap yesterday. Engineer Dave
Linden turned on the water from the
main on the wharf into the tanks and
then took a atroll along the front. When
he returned, according to his story, ne
turned the *ater off, but nevertheless it
continued to run into the tanks, over
ilowed them and ran into the engine-room,
then the hold filled up *.nd finally the
staunch little vessel went down. When
Engineer Linden returned after a second
stroll along the front the Ethel and
Marion waÂ» out of sight. She bad sunk
beDeath t c waters of the bay. The po
lice were informed that the tug had been
stolen, but daylight revealed her smoke
stack just above water and the dingey and
t>art of the deckhouse floating in the dock.
Captain Tomminson arrived on the scene
early in the morning only to find himself
out of a job. Late in the afternoon Lin
den secured the services of Whiteiaw's
wrecker and the Ethel and Marion was
raised.
Mrs. Tborold, owner of the tng, has been
particularly unfortunate. Some time ago
her husband vied trom an accident. He
was playing with bis little girl and ran a
crochet-needle into bis band. Mortifica
tion set in ana be died. The day of his
death the insurance company in which he
was insured failed, and the widow never
received a cent. Then the toe went down
in the great norther that wrecked Fisher
men's wharf, and ever since she has been
in more or less trouble. Mrs. Thorold
manages the boat herself, and has barely
succeeded in making a living for her j
children.
The American bark Charles B. Kenney
eot in from the canneries yesterday. Chin
Lip Toiil' succeeded In making things
lively during the trip down. He attacked
his boss. Chin Lung, and nearly succeeded
in cutting his head off. Then he ran
amuck an^. chased several sailors into the
rigging. He was finally overpowered and
lashed mio his bunk. When the Kenney
arrived Ton^ was turned over to the
authorities, and Officer Charles Calahan
took him to the Receiving Hospital, from
which he will probably be taken to the
insane asylum.
It was very rough on the bay and at sea
yesterday and several vessels dripped
their anchors in consequence. The Laura
May drifted into the frei^htboat Transit's
slip at Second street and had to be towed
out by the tug Joseph H. Redmond. The
Emma Utter carried away her mainmast
h-ad and several of the sail?, and in con
sequence had to return to port. The S.
Danielson from Usal had her deckioad of
bark washed overboard, but was other
wise only slightly injured, and several
other of the small bay craft met with
minor injuries.
The Harbor Commissioners held another
secret session yesterday and discussed
Tennessee marbie and incidentally Presi
dent Colnon's visit to Sacramento this
week. The Board of Examiners want to
know all about the contracts lor the new
ferry depot, and the president of the com
mission is to do the explaining.
ihe steamer Monticeilo will not make
her usual run to Vallejo to-night. Some
repairs are necessary and she will not get
away a^ain until to-morrow at 10:30 a. m.
GOVERNMENT TIMBER.
Special Agent Prior Makes Important
Discoveries in the btocktoh
District.
In a few days the Federal authorities
will institute civil proceedings against
certain parties in Tuolumne County for
the recovery of $30,000, alleged to be due
for timber taken from Government lands.
It is not improbable that criminal suits
will also follow.
Among the companies alleged to have
taken Government timber are the Empire
Mill Company, South Fork Mill Company,
Rushing Bros, and the Bradfords of So
nora County.
Special Agent Prior has been busily en
gaged in this matter, ana whatever is dis
covered is due to him. It is estimated
that in Tuolumne County alone over
6,000,000 feet of lumber has been stolen
within the past twenty years. The inves
tigation so far instituted shows about
3,000,000 feet, but not half of the period
already named has been covered.
There seems to be no telling just where
the Dresent investigations will end.
CHARLES D. WHEAT DEAD
Sudden Demise From Heart
Disease of a Leading No
tary Public.
Deceased Was a Confederate Veteran
and Prominent in Fraternal
Societies.
Charles D. Wheat, the notary public and
commissioner of deeds, died at his home,
2118 Steiner street. Friday night rather
suddenly. His demise resulted from heart
disease, he having been afflicted with this
malady for several years. Mr. Wheat was
at his office Friday and transacted a good
deal of business, as usual. As he was
about to leave his office in the evening he
complained of severe pains in his chest
and a nervous palpitation, or "choking "
sensation about the heart.
At right his suffering increased. A few
hours later he passed away. Mr. Wheat
was one of the best known notaries of the
City. He was born in Virginia, and was
aged 53 years. Though a youth when the
Civil War broke out, his sympathies led
him to enlist in the Southern cause, and
with the Forty-ninth Virginia he fought
through the greater part of that struggle.
Several times he was wounded.
He came to San Francisco soon after
the war ended, and has lived here ever
since. He had occupied an office at 501
California street for ov r twenty years.
In fraternal and church societies he was
quite a prominent figure. At one time he
was past chief ranger ia the American
Order of Foresters, and at the time of nis
decease was an officer in the Legion of
Honor.
.tie was also a vestryman of St Paul's
Episcopal Church, and a few years ago
was captain of ihe local post of Confed
erate veterans.
The funeral will be conducted by the
Jodfjes of which he was a member, and
will take place from his residence at 2118
Sieiuer street. ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1896.
FROM PULPIT,
VESTRY AND PEW
Rev. G. C. Adams Will
Preach at the First
Church To-day.
NEW METHODIST BISHOP
Rev. Dr. Newman Was an Inti
mate Friend of the Late
U. S. Grant.
HE CCKES HERE IN NOVEMBER
Golden Gate Congregational Church
Haa Chang d a Saloon Into a
Sunday-School.
The Rev. George C. Adams, D.D., ar
rived here yesterday and will preach at
the First Congregational Church to-day.
One of his first visits was to the church
whose pulpit he is to occupy for three
Sundays at least. He expressed great sat
isfaction with the auditorium and was de
lighted with the organ.
"It is remarkable how well it has kept
BISHOP NEWMAN, the New Methodist Episcopal Bishop, Who
Baptized U. S. Grant on His Deathbed,
in tune, for they tell me it has not been |
used for months. A few notes are a shade !
off, but scarcely enough to be noticeable," j
he said. Wi.en a^ked whether he was :
fond of music Dr. Adams replied that it
was one of the subjects in which he took I
deep interest. *'I am fond of music for its ;
own sake, and I believe also that it can be
of great help in the church service."
The St. Louis pastor is a genial, unaf
fected man of 45 or 50, who strikes one as
being both vractical and enthusiastic. He
minks that nothing can be gained by
dwelling on the troubles that have torn
the First Church. Indeed, he says that,
fox his own part, he knows very little
aoout them.
"It is nine years since I was in San
Francisco," he -aid. "At that time I
preached for several Sundays for Dr. Mc-
Lean at the First Church in' Oakland.
"The things that strike tue most on re
turn, ng here are the increased size of the
oitj and the cleanliness of its streets.
They are infinitely b^tier than the streets
ol St. Louis or New York.''
Talking of streets led to the subject of
muniiival reform, and the doctor was
asked whether he believed in pastors tak
ing an active part in civic affairs.
"That is a delieats question." he said.
"For myself, I find my pu!n;tand pastoral
duties have led me very little time for
participating perbonally in such move
ments. I think, peihaps, a pastor can ex
ercise a wider influence by induc'ng the
men of 1m flock to interest themselves in
such affairs. There is Dr. Dale of Birming
ham, Bog. He has taken li'.tle part In
public affairs himself, but the men of his
rogation are the leaders of public
movements and recently Parliament had
to consider his views on a social subject
because of the number of votes that were
wielded by his congregation."
Dr. Adams was born March 7,1850, in
Castine, Maine. After graduating from
the High School of his native town he
entered Yale Theological Seminary,
whence he prahiated with hiph honors in
1875, beinn ordained a few days luter. On
tbe 22d of May of the same year he mar
ried Mi - Mrcie Perkins Shepardson of
West Brooksvilie, Maine. He has a family
of nine.
During a period of twenty-one years
and more Dr. Adams hns had only three
pastorates, his first in HUlsboro, 111.,
which he entered in July, 1875; his second
in Alt' n, 111., whitaer he went in March,
1877, and his last in Pilgrim Mission, St.
Louis, where he commenced his labors in
1881, and built up the present Compton
Mill Congregational Church and parish.
Tne church building is large and hand
some with a seating capacity of 1600, and
a numerous membership.
In bt. Louis Dr. Adams owns his mag
nificent $10,000 residence and is exceed
ingly popular, though he commenced his
career there "without a member and with
out a dollar," to quote the language of one
of his admirinc friends. He received tbe
doctorate in 1888 from Illinois College, of
which Institution be has long been a trus
tee. He is aiso a trustee of Drury College,
director of the St. Louis Congregational
City Missionary Society, and chairman of
the State Home Missionary Society of St.
Louis, besides being actively connected
with other charitable and religious enter
prises.
At present Dr. Adams only contem
plutes occupying the pulpit of the First
Churchjfor three weeks, but he says he
does not know what the future may bring
forth.
Resolutions have been nassed by the
board f deacons of the First Congrega
tional Church stronely condemning the
report that the deucons and church were
not unanimous in calling Dr. Adams.
It is expected that Hey. John P. New
man, D.D., L.L.D., the new Methodist
Episcopal Bishop, will arrive in this City
with his family about the 15th of Novem
ber. Bishop Newman, who comes here from
Omaha, is one ot the most noted divines
in the Methodist church.
Not only is he an eloquent preacher and
writer, but his association with Uiysses S.
Grant lias made him aim st a historical
character. It was his church in Washing
ton, D. C, that Grant attended, and a
warm personal friendship grew up be
tween him and the President. When
Grant made his famous tour of the world
Rev. Dr. Newman accompanied him in
the capacity of chaplain and friend, and
during the ex-President's latst illness Dr.
Newman gave him spiritual ministrations
and baptized him on Ms deathbed.
Bishop JVewman was born in New York
.City in 1826, and was elected a Bishop
eight years ago. He was a personal friend
of the late Senator Btanford, and when
Lelaud Stanford Jr. died he accompanied
the remains across the continent and
preached the funeral sermon in Grace
Episcopal Church, Bi~h<^j> Kip and Rev.
Dr. Foute also assign* in the service. Dr.
Newman was at tnat tin_e a noted Meth
odist divine, but he was not a Bishop.
Some of his books arÂ« used as text-bo, ks
in the church. "From Dan to Beersheba"
is an account of his travels, which has
been widely read.
A number of local Methodist churches
will to-day have new pastors. Rev. Dr.
Urmv will be at the First Church, Rev.
Dr. F. Jewell at Trinity, Rev. Dr. Chilson
at the Potrero Church, Rev. G. R. Sianley
(succeeds Rev. E. M. Hill at the Fifteenth
avenue Church, and Rev. Dr. Phelps of
San Luis Obispo goes to the California
street Cinirch.
The Golden Gate Congregational Sunday
school was organized last Sunday, the i3th
inst., under very encouraging auspices at
the northeast corner of Point Lobos ave
nue and Twenty -fourth avenue, Rich
mond, in what was until recently a build
ing occupied as a saloon. The room has
been supplied with an organ and will be
furnished with everything necessary for
the work begun. The sessions will be held
every Sunday morning, commencing at
10:30 o'clock, under tie leadership of Mr.
Sidney A. McOaw, superintendent, who
will be assisted by Mrs. May H. McGaw,
Miss Alice Guthrie, Mrs. Browne and
others.
A four weeks' mission was inaugurated
at St. Joseph's Church, Tenth street, near
Howard, in this City, on the 13th. The
mission will be conducted DvtheÃedemp
torist Fathers O'Shea and Mnllane. Ten
years have elapsed since a mission has
been given in St. Joseph's parish. Inter
est in this one is therefore very keen and
everything points to a most successful
mission.
Tbe ladies of the Church of the Holy
Ghost, Centerville, will bold a bazaar in
aid of the church during tbe month of
October.
The sermon by the Rev. Horatio Steb
bins this morning at the First Unitarian
Church will be ou tbe "The Conditions of
the Country."
The Death of A. VVmldteufel.
A Coroner's jury has been Impaneled to con

THE PHYSICIAN OF THE HOUR.
That Doctor Cook is a true specialist of |
the very highest attainments has long
been known throughout the medical
world. That he is now so regarded by the
sick people of San Francisco and tne i
slope is indicated by the vast number of j
them who continue to seek bis profes
sional services from day to day. They go
to him for help because he is an upright,
honest, high-minded gentleman as well as
a great physician who is able to cure every j
curable disease with which humanity is :
afflicted.
In the treatment of Lost or Weakened J
Manhood and their long train of distress- j
ing symptoms; in the treatment of Gon
orrhoea, Gleet, Stricture and Syphilis; in
the treatment of Varicocele, Hydrocele,
Atropny or the wasting away of the or
gans; in tbe treatment of these and simi
lar sexual ailments Doctor Cook is beyond
the shadow of a question the leading and
most successful specialist in the United
States to-day.
Doctor Cook cures not only every Kind
of sexual debility, deformity or decay, bat
he also ctm*s Pile*, Fistula, Rupture and
Chronic Catarrh. He pays particular at
tention to ailments of the Eye, Ear, Nose,
Throat, Brain, and to diseases of the Heart,
Lungs, Liver, Stomach, Kidneys, Bladder
and Urinary Organs. Female complaints
of every character also come within his
specialty.
If you have any of the above afflictions
do not give up in despair. Consult Doc
tor Cook, who cures where other physicians
only experiment. He has no substitutes,
bnt he himself, personally, goes thoroughly
into each individual case and carefully
follows it through all its various stages
until completely cured.
Doctor Cook's system of home treatment
by mail is perfect, and if you cannot call
write. Tell everything fully and without
reserve. The Doctor's office is located in
the heart of San Francisco, at 865 Market
street, opposite the Baldwin Hotel. His
hours for consultation and treatment are
from 9 to 12 a. m. and 2 to 5 and 7 to 8
p. m., except Sundays, when they are from
10 to 12 a. m. only.

CITY'S FLOATING DEBT.
Grand Jury Suggestion That the Elec
tors Vote on the Question of
Payment.
Before making the final report last
Thursday the Grand Jury sent the follow
ing communication to the Board of Eelec
tion Commissioners:
Gentlemen: The Grand Jury of the City and
County, by resolution unanimously adopted at
its meeting tnlp date, requests you to put upoa
the ballot to be used at the coming election in
November, 1896. the following questions:
"To pay the floating indebtedness and ac
crued interest of the City incurred during
the fiscal year 1892-93. Yes."
"To pay the floating indebtedness and ac
crued interest of the City incurred during the
fiscal year 1892-93. No."
Tne Grand Jury does not know the exact
amount of tjie floating indebtedness other than
it is between $200,000 and $3UO,O(K>, aDd was
incurred prior to the fiscal year 1393^94. The
expert of the Board of Supervisors has an ac
couni of the indebtedness and can furnish a
statement to your honorable body.
The Grand Jury regards the existence of tnis
indebtedness as not only a gross injustice to
the persons who furnished supplies or labor at
the time, but as a disgrace to the people of this
City, whose good faith is thereby impugned.

TAYLOR TALKED
TO SILVERITES
Planks in the Democratic
National Platform
Discussed.
MONEY THE ONLY ISSUE
So Declared the Advocate of the
White Metal From Colo
rado.
AN HALL PACKED
Prices and Circulation the Main
Themes of the Speaker of
the Evening.
There were probably 2500 people present
at Metropolitan Hall last night to listen
to the advocates of free silver, and many,
unable to obtain even standing room, were
forced to find their evening's entertain
ment elsewhere. Many ladies were in the
audience.
Across the organ back of the platform
appeared in large letters of silver, "Wil
liam J. Bryan, the great defender," and
on an easel on tne platform was a life
size portrait of the silver champion
framed in smilax.
Judge Lawlor, after explaining that the
meeting was held under the auspices of
the California Silver Campaign Commit
tee, introduced Tnotoas J. Clunie as the
chairman of the meeting, who made an
address touching the money question.
He declared that in the past all the
political parties of the State of California
had always been in favor of the free and
unlimited coinage of both gold and silver
at the ratio of 16 to 1. He claimed that
the Republican convention at St. Louis
was captured by the money power and
that the Democratic convention at Chi
cago was without a programme, and had
as a consequence nominated a man who
truly represented the people of the coun
try. He named, one after another, the
candidates who had been named at the
Chicago convention, reserving that of the
nominee of the Democratic party as the
last. The name of Bryan evoked great
applause, which continued for some time.
The plank of the platform of the Repub
lican party declaring for free silver by in
ternational agreement was denounced as
placing the country in a position of sec
ondary importance to the other nations of
the world.
After a sons: by the Knickerbocker quar
tet, M. F. Taylor of Colorado, the speaker
of the evening, addressed the gathering.
In the course of his speech he declared
that he serves his party best who serves
his country best. The money question he
pronounced the most momentous ques
t ion ever forced upon the people oi the
United States, not even excepting the
causes which led to the Civil War.
"This fi^ht," be said, "is not only to
free the American people from financial
slavery, but to show the people of the
world that the American people are capa
ble of governing themselves.
"This year there is no mistaking where
we standâ the platform on which William
J. Bryan stands is clear cut as a crystal.
There are some things in it, perhaps,
which neither you nor I would have put
in it if we had written the platform."
Referring to the assault on the Supreme
Court contained in the Democratic Na
tional platform he declared the members
of that body were after all but the servants
of the people. "God help this country,"
he continued, "when the people may not
criticize the action of even the highest
officer in the land.
"I believe in free silver because I have
been taut:nt that there has not been
enough gold dug out of the ground to do
the business of the world."
He declared that this Nation should
undertake the remonetization of silver
without the co-operation of other nations,
and emphatically declared that this could
be accomplished to the benefit of tlie
country, as the Federal Government has
the right to coin anything into legal ten
der money that it chooses.
This country, he said, had less than
$800,000,000 ol legal tender money in circu
lation, that is, gold.
In the East, he said, the banks were
winnowing out all greenbacks and treas
ury notes and paying out only silver, sil
ver certificates and National bank notes,
and that it is impossible to get the banks
to pay out a single dollar in gold, except
where they have to meet an obligation
payable in cold. He told his hearers that
an offer of \% per cent premium was made
in New York City for $5000 in gold, but
the banks refused to sell.
Assuming the quaint negro dialect of
Alabama he told a story of a horse that
had been worked and starved to the stage
of prostration. A neighbor was called in
and expressed the opinion that the horse
looked starved. He was informed tnat
that could not be so because there was
plenty of hay ana grain in the barn. The
neighbor promptly retorted: "It is in
the wrong place if you want that horse to
work. It should be in the horse."
"So it is with the lenal tender money of
the country," he continued. "It is in the
banks. Let them put it into the hands of
the people of the country and they will
not lie prostrate, but will work for their
interests and the interests of the coun
try."
Statistics were quoted in the attempt to
show that prices bad fallen by reason of
the appreciation of gold, and the speaker
denounced the gold dollar as the most
"damnably dishonest dollar" ever offered
to a nation.
Calling attention to the quantities of
silver in the vaults of the Treasury De
partment at Washington he asked, "Why
don't they give some of this silver to the
farmers?" Then, continuing, ne said:
"If this silver is good enough to give to
the men who work in our factories, who
wear flannei shirts, who Have beards
through whicn the wind blows, it ought
to be good enongh for any foreign noble
man who ever married an American
heiress."
SHERIFF OF YUBA
The Place That Was So Acceptably
Filled by Samuel E.
Inlow. "
The Supervisors of Yuba County have
been having quite a lively time in "voting
for a Sheriff to fill the vacancy caused by
the death of Samuel E. Inlow. The peo
ple of the county doubt if another man as
strong and well fitted in every respect as
the late Sheriff can be found. Samuel E
Inlow had many struggles for the < ffice of
Sheriff of YuDa, but in 1886 he was elected
and re-elected in 1892 and 1894 weciea
iÂ«Â£i r ' wIOWw IOW Was born in Kentucky in
1836. He crossed the plains and settled n
caused hiâ¢ chara^ ter and strength which
caused him to be regarded as a mÂ«n
worthy of confidence in the hfihJst <fe
gree. For many months prior to his de?Â£
he was attended by physicians in , thÂ£
City. His sister, Mrs. Lucy McDonald,
resides in San Francisco. She attended
the funeral ceremonies recently beld at
Marysville and the interment at Wood
land. _
A PASTOR' ANNIVERSARY
Dr. and Mrs. E. B. Dllle Celebrate
Their Silver Wedding.
Last Thurday evening at tne Central
Methodist Episcopal Church a reception
was tendered Rev. Dr. Dille and wife upon
the occasion of Dr. Dille's b ing appointed
foi the eighth time to the pastorate ol
that church. The lecture-room and par
lors were thronged with the members oi
the church and congregation and their
friends, nearly 1000 people taking occasion
to coneratulate tne happy pair.
It happened that the occasion was also
the twenty-nfth anniversary of the mar
riage of Dr. and Mrs. Dille. R. V. Watt
in his address of welcome reierred in
graceful terms to that fact, and at the
cl-se of the address presented the pastor
and his wife, in behalf of their host of
friends, with a cut-glass and silver table
service. The recepients were taken oy
surprise, but manag d to respond in a few
feeling words.
Brief addresses were given by Dr. W.
W. Case and Dr. E. E. Kelly. A choice
musical programme was rendered and
the balance of the evening was given up
to congratulations and social festiviries.
POISON TO END GRIEF.
After a Lovers' Quarrel Miss
Annie Rivist Took a Large
Dose of Laudanum.
Carried It With Her. While Baggy
Riding and Said She Was
Tired of Life.
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 19. f
Miss Annie Rivist made a desperate at
tempt to commit suicide to-night because
of some unpleasantness between her and
her lover. Had her parents not discovered
ncr till an hour later her life would then
have been ended.
This evening Miss Rivist went for a
buggy ride with her lover, John Neat, an
employe of the city. They were not gone
lone, as the ride was far from plea-ant.
The young people quarreled, and before
an hour hid passed Miss Rivist was at
home again.
She did not tell her parents of her grief,
but went to her room and was absent
some time. Her parents heard her groan
ing and on going to her room found her
on the bed, unconscious and in great
agony.
A doctor was sent for and Mr. Neat, who
made another call to see if the indiffer
ence could not be patched up, was also
present. Every effort was made to arouse
the girl, as an empty bottle marked "laud
anum," showed very plainly what the girl
had attempted. Dr. T. W. Clark responded
to the call and by prompt measures saved
the young woman's life, and at midnight
she was reported to be out of danger.
As soon as she was able she told her
lover and parents of what she had done.
She said she felt so unhappy that she
would rattier die than live and not be at
peace with her iover. She had procured
ttie laudanum some time ago, as the re
lations between them had been strained
and she feared that an open quarrel might
follow.
Miss Annie Rivist resides with her
parents at 613 Fifth street. She is of
French-Canadian birth and is 24 yeais of
age.
She was considerably impressed some
weeks ago with the suicide of Mrs.
Prussia, who took laudanum while out
buggy riding, and it is supposed that it
was her intention to follow Mrs. Prussia's
example.
The attempted suicide had a very happy
conclusion. Neat's crief was so real that
the girl was very strongly convinced she
had nothing to fear so far as his loyalty to
her was concerned, and the result was a
complete reconciliation.
Tocng to Marry.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 19.â The County
Clerk has issued a number of licenses this
week to those who should be in care ot
their mothers or some better guardians.

DRAW POKER IS GAMBLING
So Decided in a Long-Delayed
Case Before Recorder
St. Sure.
Decorating the Opera-House for Mon
day's Convention â Visiting Pas
tors in the Churches.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. Sept. 19.â Joseph
Emeric, who was arrested on March 14 for
keeping a gambling-house in the rsar of a
Pant-street cigar-store, was found guilty
this morning by Recorder St. Sure, who
took the case under advisement some
time ago, it having been submitted on
briefs based upon an agreed statement of
facts.
The case was brought under section 6 of
ordinance 148 of Akimeda. The defense
was that draw poker was no crime because
it had been so declared by law, and that
the Trustees could not pass an ordinance
making it a crime without expressed
authority of the Legislature.
"In order to meet the various devices to
evade the letter of the law," said the Re
corder in conclusion, "the statutory difi
nitions are usually minute, specifying a
great variety of detail. The essential
features of all, or nearly all, laws against
common gaming in nouses consist in
the prohibition of maintaining a place of
shelter in any degree acces>ible to the
public, whether open to all who come or
only to a select or favored few, as a place
of resort for the purpose of gaming. This
fits the case at bar exactly."

LESS COMPLEX
Oakland's Republican Pri
maries Fail to Shed
Much Light
FRED STRATTON AHEAD
The Superior Judgeship in Doubt,
Though Hall Is Thought
to Be Sale.
LEAVITT FOR THE ASSEMBLY.
Twenty-Nine Anti-Perkins Delegai
Will Be Sent to the Forthcoming
Convention â Rumors.
Oakland Office San Fkancipco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 19. f
The Republican primaries were held
throughout the county this afternoon and
evening, and the situation is only a little
less complex than it was before.
Fred S. Stratton will go into Monday's
convention with every delegate from the
Twenty-seventh Senatorial District. His
opponent, Dr. Derrick, did not win in a
Bingle precinct.
The coulest for Superior Judjre is still
in doubt. S. P. Hall will certainly have
more than enough votes to nominate on
the first ballot, but the other nomina
tion is in doubt.
It has been generally thought that Judge
Greene's strength is as great as that of
Hall, but this was denied to-night by
some of Hall's most intimate friends. In
fact, they openly say that Hall's vote
would have been even larger had so much
not been made of the "Hall-Greene"
slogan.
G. W. Langan has carried every dele
gate in the out3ide townships except six
in Eden, which go to Greene. W. L. Hill
has been the running mate of Langan so
far asthe judiciary contest goes, and it is
generally considered that alter Hall the
chances are for Langan, Greene, Hill and
Allen, in the order named.
The managers of tbe party say that no
other names than those mentioned will
go before the convention. Allen's strength
is the most difficult of the many to esti
mate. In the First Ward the only place
where he had a ticket of his own he car
ried out every delegate.
F. W. Leavitt v.ill certainly be nomi
nated for the Assembly from the Forty
eighth Assembly District, as his ticket
carried tiie Fourth and Sixth wards with
a large majority.
He is absolutely unpledged on the Sena
torial question, and last night Chairman
Mau;aie:i oi the County Committee stated
that a determined fight would be made
against Perkins in the Sixth and Fourth
wards.
The fi^ht was male and won, and as tbe
Fourth Ward is Senator Denison's it is
certain that his recent remarks about
Perkins were not idle. These two wards
will send twenty-nine delegates to the
convention, and as they are all anti-Per
kins his indorsement for United States
Senator will not be unanimous and will
not be voted upon until there has been i
heated debate, as several delegates will
take advantage of the opportunity to ex
press their feelings regarding the Hilborn-
Frick affair.
Nearly all the other Assembly Districts
are in doubt. H. XV. Taylor oi Berkeley
has the most apparent strength in his dis
trict, aiid Ciark of Alvarado has also a
fair hold on the delegates. The other dis
tricts cannot be guessed intelligently.
No one is absolutely certain of a nomi
nation for Supervisor, although it is cer
tain that Baily of Livermore will not suc
ceed himself, as he lo^t every delegate in
his own township. Mitchell of the First
District has several delegates, but will
have a hard light, as Pelouze has an
nounced that he will run independent.
The other district is in doubt.
A WOMAN SNIPE-SHOOTER

Cigar Stumps.

Items-
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 19.-The unl
versity town is possessed of a freak in the
person of a female "snipe-shooter." She
has been going about the streets for the
last few days gathering up all tbe cigarette
"snipes" and cigar stubs that she caught
sight of. Already the female tobacco
scavenger has picked up enough castaway
"snipes" from the Berkeley gutters to
This WcII-Dressed "Woman Has
Created a Sensation in Berkeley
fey Going: Around the Streets and
Picking Up the Butts of Half-
Smoked Cigars, Ggarettes, etc
Keep a small sized cigarette factory busy
for a week. This "snipe-shooter" is a
well-dressed woman, about 45 years of age,
and is supposed to hail from San Fran
cisco. From her appearance one would
not have the least suspicion that she was
engaged in the "sniping" business, but
en the other hand would rather take her
for a prosperous forewoman of a shift fac
tory, or head ironer in a modern laundry.
At her present occupation she is cer
tainly an adept. The system under which
she carries on tier business is incieod
unique. Walking along the sidewalk like
any other vedes'rian, but close to tho
gutter, however, she first "spots" her
sought-for "snipe." Passing it by at first,
the suddenly wheels about and drops a
newsjapjr, which she always carries, on
top ot tlie "snipe. " Ostensibly stooping
to pick up th^ paper, si;e secures both pa
per and cigar sinmp. When no one is
looking she slips her "hnd'' into a large
pocket sewed on the inside ot a long, >o >^c
shoulder-cape. Proceeding along until
another "butt" has been found themethod
of getting it into her bag is repeated.
To-day she worked the di>trict around
Berkeley station and Dwight way, and
then took the streetcar for more extensive
fields In Oakland.
The unusual spectacle of a woman gath
ering cigar stubs caused quite a flurry of
excitement on the streets. The peculiar
smoothness with which she conducted her
operations exciteJ much interest, and be
fore siie haii been at v,-ork for ten minutes
she had following after her a crowd of ten
or more curious men and boys.
The I'riiuaries in Berkeley.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 19.â At the
primary tins anernoon the double-headed
"Stratum and Hill" ticket carried the day
by a ratio of alutost three to one, having
received 811 votes, while only 287 were
cast for the "Hill" ticket. Following was
the vote by precincts: Precinct No- 1,
North Berkeley, Stratton 128, Hill 36; No.
2, West Berkeley, Stratton 200, Hill 85;
No. 3, East Berkeley. Stratton 115, Hill 61 ;
No. 4, Divight way, Stratton 136, Hiil 46;
No. 5, Ashby avenue, Stratton 85, Hill
20; No. 6, Lorin, fciratton 119, Hill TJ.
Total straight votes cast, 1098.
Comparatively little scratching was
done on either ticket. The general senti
ment has been so strong of late in Strat
tqn's favor, because of his having pledged
himself to work vigorously for the inter
ests of the university, tnat his choice for
the senatorsliiu among tbe citizens of the
college town was a foregone conclusion.
Examinations in August.
BERKELEY. Cal., Sept. 19.â Recorder

innovation, ns heretofore two examina
tions were offered â ono in May and the
other in August.
Under tue old system students were al
lowed to divide their examinations be
tween these t"Â«o periods, while under the
new law all the "exes" must be taken at
the same time.

WHITE TALKS OF SILVER.
The Senator and Other Demo
crats Talk at the Tab
ernacle.
First Meeting Held by the United
Bryan Forces Since the Nomina
tion of the Southern Man.
Oakland Office San Francisco caix,)
903 Broadway, Sept. 19. >
The Democrats, Populists and silver
men heid a mass-meeting at the Taber
nacle to-night. The hall was pretty well
filled with an audience which had gath
ered to hear Senator S. M. White deliver
an address. It is the first meeting held
by the united Bryan forces since bis nom
ination. Senater "Wnite was escorted
from the train by a band and an escort of
the Young Men's Democratic Club.
M. J. Laymance of the County Demo
cratic Committee called the meeting to
order. *
George W. Baker was the first speaker
and be briefly reviewed the progress of the
Siiver League of the Pacific Coast since its
organization. He said it consisted of
Democrats, Republicans and Populists
and is daily growing larger and more
powerful. In a pretty sentence Mr. Baker
introduced Miss Mollie E. Conners, editor
of Oakland Saturday Night.
"Things have come to a pretty pass,"
said Miss Connor*, "when a man of 36 is
called a boy orator. Pitt ruled England
when he was even younger than Bryan,
wiiom they aeride and ridicule to-day
and call a youth- Mary Bryan is as good
a partner as you want for your President.
Co ming into our Golden Gate this fali we
shall see our sh;p of state, the Bryanite
ship, and nailed at the masthead shall be
the flag of free silver and prosperity to a
clamoring Nation."
Warren B. English made a few remarks
and introduced the speaker of the evening,
Stephen M. White.
"Our entire country stands to-day," he
B;tid, "in the attitude of a helpless, heart
sick baby Nation. This is the hour when
American yeomanry is at a premium and
not party influences, of which we know
and hear so much. Two years aeo your
State convention resolved in favor of the
free and unlimited coinage of silver. You
meant it then and you mean it now. lam
here now to call on you to arise above the
dictates of Mark Hanna.' 1
Mr. White spoke at length upon what
he considered tbe basi9 of Republicanism
in California. He alluded to the widely
different ami, as he thought, inconsistent
action of the Republicans in a later con
veutior. tnan tuat held at Sacntmento.
Mr. White concluded his speech by out
lining the policy upon which his party
ext ected to win out. It is mainly by re
stricting foreign immigration and by
fighting the money markets of the world

The Populist County Convention, held
to-day, was very different from that of a
few months ago, when delegates were
elected to the State Convention. Then
the younger element, known aa the
"short-hairs," was in control; to-day all
GREEN MAJORS of Alameda, Chairman of |
the Populist County Convention.
was changed and the senior element,
known as the "long-hairs," was in abso
lute control.
Adoa A. Denison was chairman of the
former convention and carried everything
before him; to-day the convention would
have nothing of its lornier chairman, and
when Denison tried to speak in support of
a minority report on credentials he was
actually invited to sit down, while many
shouted, "Gag him!" It was a great fall
in a few short mouths, but A. A. Brptz
was once more in control and Danison's
prestige had endel.
The convention met at 9 o'clock, and
owing to the number of orators who in
sisted on being heard no nominations bad
been made at 5 p. it. Every little debat
able point was made the subject of argu
ment, and although the "middle-of-the
road" men could not be deprived of their
three-minutes' speeches their talking was
all in vain, for the "long-hairs" who a few
short weeks ago bowled themselves
hoarse from the City Hall forum against
fusion had changed their minds and had
everything their own way. But the short
en<iers talked just the same.
Green Majors of Alameda was elected
etiairman ana spoke briefly about eternal
vigilance, freedom and usury.
Judge Gibson helped to entertain the
delegates while tue committee on creden
tials was prepanug its report. Referring
to fusion he said: '-I went into the Popu
list party because I was converted. I was
in favor of the nomination of Mr. Bryan,
not the indorsement, because I believe he
is more of a Populist than a Democrat ;
because I believe him to be a sincere man.
I believed in nominating Liim because I
bÂ»Â»ijeve lie is with tha people ami out with
the monopolists and plutocrats of the
country. Not to go into convention with
those opposed to Mr. McKiniey means de
feat, and is it not better to join and elect
part of our ticket ? I am in lavor, therefore,
of joining with the Democrats at this
time and securing a portion of the local
offices.
"in order to do this some will probably
be disappointed, but the Populists have- to
yield something. Do you not think that
it would be a good thing for the Populist
party to have even two members of the
party in tlie Board of Supervisors? The
Populists have an opportunity to elect
three Supervisors, who will Bupport our
Populist Assessor, Dalton."
M th. Dr. Kellogg- Lane made some timely
remarks about woman's suffrage, and
after appointing a committee on resolu
tions the delegates went to lunch.
When the afternoon session opened the
friction commenced. Ttie credentials com
mittee reported in favor of not permitting
any cffk-e-hol'ier to sit as a delegate.
There was a minority report against dis
qaaliflcation because of ofh'ce-hold'ng, and
a heated debate lolioweti. A. A. Denison
was speaking, and had used his time,
when some one proposed be be given
three minutes more. Ten minutes were
wasted in debate, and Denison was de
feated in his aspiration.
Charles White, ton of the Sheriff, said
it was veiy apparent the report was aimed
at him and said it was absurd, as unaer
that ruling a man who worked on the
streets could be shut out from being a del
egate.
A final vote showed that the office
holders were not in favor and they left
their seats.
Then came the important question of
the adoption of the report on fusion.
Tlie report provided that the People's
party shall have the Assemly nomina
tions for t ho Forty-seventh, Forty-ninth
and Fifty. lir.Â«t Assembly districts, the
nomination of Supervisor for tbe Fourth
Supervisor District, one Judge cf the Su
perior Court, and one Justice of the Peace
for Oakland city, and that the Democratic
party shall have the nominations for As
semblymen in the Forty-sixth, Forty
eighth and Fiftieth districts, for Senator
in the Twenty-seventh Senaicrial District,
one Judge of the Superior Court and one
Justice of the Peace for the city of Oak
land.
While tbe argument about its adoption
was in progress H. C. McPike, from the
Democratic Convention, which was in ses
sion a few blocks away, aropped in and
delivered some good Democratic doctrine,
it was like oil oa troubled waters, aud
after some more talking by the conference
committee the report was adopted.
Owing to the persistency of some of the
delegates to indulpe in talking the conven
tion lasted for more than an hour after the
ratification meeting had opened at the
Tabernacle.
The following nominations were made:
Forty-seventh Assembly District -â  Green
Majors of Alameda.
Forty-ninth Assembly Districtâ Ed Magulre
of Oakland.
Fifty-first Assembly Districtâ Dr. A. F.
Childs.

HENRY McPIKL'3 PAUSES.
They Were Necessary to Induce
Delegates and Proxy. Ho'ders
to Cheer.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Sept. 19. f
There has frequently been more enthusi
asm in the Tabernacle than there was to
il;* y during the Democratic county con
vention, but there has never been less.
The name of XV. J. Bryan did not en
i danger the roof, and when Chairman Me-
Pike read the platform he met with the
disappointment of his life. He read the
indorsing paragraph and duly paused after
the words, "Bryan and Sewall," but there
was no response. Suddenly the son of
Postmaster White took the cue and kicked
the floor. Others fohowed suit, and the
name of the Nebraska man who uses
Scriptural similes was accorded a half
hearted cheer.
Chairman Laymance of the County Cen
tral Committee called the delegates, and it
was found that there was a large number
of proxies. Seth Mann was unanimously
elected to preside over the convention and
Leo Park was made secretary.
During the recess there was a little ex
citement. J. B. Bernard, a liveryman of
Niles, became involved in an altercation
with J. P. Bedard, a blacksmith of tbe
same place, upon the floor of the conven
tion and slapped the latter's face. Dur
ing the primaries Bernard bet Bedard $20
that he (Bernard) would be in the conven
tion. When they met to-day it was in
the delegation's seats on the floor aud
Bernard told Bedard that he had no busi
ness there. Bedard replied that Bernard
hartstuffel the ballot-box to get there.
This was denied with an oath and ihe lie
was passed when Bernard slapped the oth
er's face and friends parted tnem.
At the noon hour Bedard swore to a
warrant for his assailant's arrest. During
tbe afternoon session an otiicer came in
and took Bernard out. At the City Hall
Bernard put up $100 and returned to the
convention.
The report of tbe platform committee
was as follows:
The Democratic party of Alameda County,
-in convention assembled, expresses its hearty
indorsement of the principles embodied in the
late National and State Democratic platforms.
VVe offer William J. Brvan for President and
Arthur Sewnl. for Vice-President cf the United
Mates our united support and hid them god
speed on the highway of their efforts in behalf
of a long suffering, patient, but law-abiding
people.
We believe that the obligations of benefici
aries of the public bounty should be strictly
enforced; that our prosperity should not be
weighted down with obligations that should
be liquidated in this day and generation. We
therefore express our disapproval aud con
demnation of any effort by Congress to fund
the debt of the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany.
We believe in accommodating our county
highways to the demands of an advancing
civilization, and to that end pledge our nomi
nees for Supervisors and Legislature to use all
legitimate efforts to accomplish such a result.
We lavor the continuance of the State Bu
reau of Highways provided by the last Legis
lature, and pledge our nominees to an active
interest In its perpetuatiou and effectiveness,
to the end that the whole State may be brought
under a uniform system of highways, thus
insuring to tao public the best meana oi inter
communication.
We believe in a just rate of assessment of
property, and pledge our nominees for Super
visors to act with fairness and impartiality in
the discharge of the function of Equalizers.
Wo are proud of the record made by Hon.
Stephen >[. White, United States Senator from
California. He has stood up manfully and bat
tled hard for the rights of the people.
We disapprove of the conduct of Congress
man S. G. Hiiborn In having passed a bill
through Congress by which the people of Oak
land were permitted to purchase a lot and
build a postoffice for the use of the United
States. This being the sum of his efforts in be
hah of the people of the Congressional district
we permit him to gracefully return to the
gloom of his own obscurity.
The reports of the various committees
were received and passed by the conven
tion, ami business oroceeded rapidly.
R. M. Fitzgerald called for the fusion
report. It was read by H. C. McPike, and
every time Bryan's name was mentioned
he paused and waited for the faint cheer
that seemed to hesitate to come. Judge
Gibson and A. A. Broty, from the Popu
list convention down the street, appeared
at this stage, and there was a little love
feast, and all was agreed to with the ex
ception of some difficulty over a Super
visorial district.
The following nominations were made
by the Democratic convention:
Superior Judgeâ Thomas L. Garrity of Oak

Brown is particularly incensed at not

COUNCIL GOES ON RECORD
One More Resolution Passed to
Keep Even With the Ala
meda Trustees.
Anxious to Avoid Any Possibe Mis
understanding With the War
Department.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 19. j
The City Council has gone on record in
the tidal canal matter. Several months
ago they were induced to sign a memorial
to the War Department asking that the
tidal canal at the Alameda end of the es
tuary be constructed first. They thought
no more of the matter until they heard
some weeks later that there was a conflict
at Washington between the petitions to
which were appended the names of the
Oakland Ciiy Council.
An investigation was made, and it was
discovered that they had signed the sec
ond petition, believing that it was along
tbe same lines as the first. They found
out their mistake and at once did all they
could to rectify it. The result was a pro
cession of petition-bearers bound for

Convention.
ADOPTS A BIG PLATFORM

From the National
Committee.
ENJOY THEMSELVES GREATLY
A Lot of Names Suggested for the
Mayoralty and for the Office
of Supervisors.
The Kelly-Mahoney municipal conven
tion held a short and noisy session in
B'nai B'rith Hall last evening at which a
platform was reported that troubled every
vote-casting element and every condition
of life in the City and County. A docu
ment was read by Mr. Ruef, which Mr.
Ruef declared made of the convention the
only Republican party, and this was
loudly cheered.
The document was a typewritten notifi
cation signed by the officers of the Na
tional Committee, declaring that the
Fourth Congressional District Republican
Committee, led by Joseph S. Spear Jr.,
was the properly qualified committee â a
reiteration of what was said at St. Louis.
Under this the Fourth Congressional Dis
trict Committee proceeded to hold a con-

vention to nominate officers for the entire
City and for the Legisiature in much bet
ter spirits.
Chairman Sonntag called the conven
tion to order and the committee on plat
form and order of business reported. Mr.
Ruef read the platform, ten pages of type
written le al-can, complaining in the be
ginning that they had not bad time
enough to do as much as they would have
liked.
The first page consisted of glittering gen
eralities, which led up at the beginning
of the second page to an indorsement of
the National Republican ticket. After
that it began to particularize.
It complimented the chairman of the
Republican State Committee, Hon. Frank
McLaughlin; then it declared that no
person would be nominated by that con
vention for any office except he was quali
fied for an honest and economical man
agement of the same; it thoueht the
present system of primary elections was
pernicious and cried out for a better one;
it declared the public - school system
was a "bulwark of our liberties," and
favored the development of the non
sectarian educational system and pledged
its candidates for School Directors
to strict economy, looking first to the pay
ment of teachers' salaries; it favored a
good fire department, and commended the
present chief; it also flattered the polica
department; it favored fair competition
in street work and the repaying of Market
street and the lighting of Golden Gate
Park. It reached out for the bicycle vote
in these words, "Tne claims of a large,
influential and most respected element of
our community interes:ed in the use of
the bicycle,' 1 etc., to the effect that streets
should be improved and railroads be re
quired to carry the bike as baggage.
The folks in the Mission were not over
looked, tbeir demand for park and public
school improvements being favored.
Payment of the back debts owed by
the City and County to merchants was
favoied, as was a repeal of the order tag

and water are guaranteed and a dollar

limit for taxation in succeeding para
graphs.
A constitutional amendment is favored
providing that members of the Board of
Equalization be nominated from their re
spective districts, but shall be voted for
by electors. Thanks were extended to
Messrs. Cheese borough and Golgan of the
said board.
The platform then broke its bounds
and spread into National politics, saying
that it was opposed to all Southern Pa
cific funding propositions, favoring the
construction of the Nicaragua canal and
of the Pacific cable to the Sandwich
Islands; sympathized with the Cubans
and was opposed to the immigration of
cheap Chinese and Japanese labor, and
is "unqualifiedly opposed to all religious
intolerance in politics and public affairs,
as well as in private life."
It favored the recognition of the colored
people. Lastly luis Kelly -Mahoney plat
term delivered itself of a philippic de
nouncing single leadership, ana was for
ever against any one man, millionaire or
pauper, holding the Republican party in
the hollow of his hana.
The platform was adopted at once.
A resolution was offered providing that
in tne event of a rehearing and reversal of
the decision in the matter of Kahn va. the
Board of Election Commissioners, the
County Committee be empowered ft) make
necessary nominations Jor the officers
continued by that decision.
Mr. Ruef presented a resolution by re
quest pledging legislative nominees to

bicycles to be baggage, and requiring all
transportation companies to carry the

same as such, an<i that the scope of the
State Bureau of Highways be increased.
It was here that Mr. Ruef read his pa
per which, he claimed, made of this con
vention the only real Republican party in
this City and County and which the aver
age intelligent reader will discover does
not refer to anything in politics outside
the Fourth District. However, Ruef's an
nounceraentand reading were greeted with
prolonged cheering. The paper read as
follows:
Resolved. That the Fourth Congressional Dis
trict Republican Committee of the State of
California, consisting of Joseph S. Spear Jr..
William H. Dimond, N. J. Williams, Jacob

CONVENTION OF
NON-PARTISANS
Its Organization Completed
by the County Com
mittee.
EFFORTS TO CAPTURE IT
Frank J. Sullivan Wants to
See Brother-in-Law Phelan
Indorsed.
OFFICIALS ALREADY NAMED.
The Powerful Nominating Body Will
Bs Composed of but Fifty
Members.
An effort is already on foot to make a
Democratic sideshow of the coming Non-
Partisan convention. Last night the Non-
Partisan County Committee met in execu
tive session at Fraternal Hall to make pre
convention arrangements. Frank J. Sul
livan, he of the resounding voice and
unattainaDle political ambition, was on
hand, bowed under the burden of Brother
in-law James D. Phelan's blunt Mayoralty
ax, which he industriously sought to
whet at the Non-Partisan grindstone.
The meeting was a long one, the time
being principally consumed in discussion
of the advisability of making the present
committee the convention or of increasing
its number to 75 or 100 members.
It was finally decided to retain the
present number. Another subject of
controversy was the question of nomina
tions. The committee was and in fact
still is in doubt as to whether it will be
better to nominate an independent ticket
or to wait and indorse nominees of the
othei conventions.
It was in this argument that Sullivan
sought to get in his fine work. He would,
of course, like to see -'Buddy Jim" receive
the Non- Partisan indorsement. Most of
the members of the committee, however,
are in favor of an independent ticket and
Mr. Sullivan's aspirations are therefore
very likely to be shelved.
George K. Fitch was chosen temporary
chairman of last nighi's meeting, in
which position he was subsequently con
iirmed. Ludwig Altschul acted as tempo
rary secretary. The following convention
committees were anpointed:
On organizationâ E. J. Le Breton, I. T. Milli
k-ii, C. B. Perkins, BarCiay Henley, George K.
Fitch, Ludwig Altschul and Jere Lyni h.
On platiormâ Ludwig Altschul, E. J. Le Bre
ton, Barclay Henley, C. B. Perkins, 1. J. Tru
man and F. J. Suilivan.
On order of businessâ L.Jacobs, Charles Ash
ton and C. S. Capp.
On vacanciesâ Ludwig Altschul, Jere Lynch,
E. A. Denicke, Geurgo K. Fiich, 1. J. Truman,
F. J. Sulliyun and A. 8. Hallidie.
On Â«u<-!itingâ E. J. Le Breton, H. L. Davis,
E. M. Root, J. W. Whiting and W. H. Crim.
The following officers of the convention
were also selected;
Chairman, George K. Fitch; vice-chairmen,
Frank bullivau. A. S. Hallidie and 1. J. Tru
man; secretary, I. T. Milliten; treasurer, E. J.
Le Breton; sergeants-at-arms, Charles Ashion
and George Cummiugs.
The chairman was authorized to appoint
all standing commi.tees for the conven
tion, including the nominations commit
tee. He will report his selections at the
meeting to be held to-morrow night at
Fraternal Hall, when the reports ot sev
eral if the committees appointed will also
be received.
WHEELMEN TO PARADE.
Preparing ior a Monster Demon
stration in the Near
Future.
Discussion Participate] In by Dele
gates From Local Societies
of Bicyclists.
The local wheelmen seem desirous to
give the City and all whom it may con
cern an idea of their power. Last night
delegates from the various clubs oi the
City met at the rooms of the Bay City
Wheelmen to debat - the advisability of a
giant bicycle parade. The objoct of this
parade will be to register a solemn protest
against the condition of the City's streets
and to give the Police Department an idea
of the magnitude of the body of wheelmen
who require protection at its hands.
Judge t\ H. Kerrigan presided, and
amone those present were delegates from
the following-named clubs: The Call
Bicycle Club, Imperial, Bay City, Waver
ley, Liberty, Barker, Olympic Wheelmen,
Olympic Cyclists, Pathfinders, Golden
Gate, California, San Francisco Koad Club
and other organizations of bicyclists,
representing a membership of GOOO and
upward.
ThÂ«re was much discussion among the
delegates as to the time when the pro
posed parade should take place. Some of
the members were opposed to a night pa
rade on the ground that disorder might re
sult owing to lark of police protection.
Arthur Barendt said tne Chief oi Police
had promised that the parade would have
ample police escort and protection. He
was more in fay r of having anight parade
than one on Sunday afternoon, since the
last named course would perhaps call
forth a protest from the clergy.
Mr. Maguhe opposed the notion of a
parade, and was followed by other dele
gates to the same effect, several recom
mending an exhibition in the Pavilion or
some other large hall, an idea which
seemed to meet no little favor.
A resolution was at length ad*, rted to
the effect that a parade or demonstration
of some sort be held in the near future,
the character and date of the event to
be detrmined by the followinÂ£-namod
committee of three: P. J. Hyde, P. A. Joy
and 8. Pciser.
Mr. Maguire desired those present to
recollect that the night of the 25th inst.
had been designated by the directors of
the Mechanics' Institute as wheelmen's
night, and said he hoped all would pre
pare to make the best s .owing possible.
GAY ARMY MEN.
Knjoy.'ihle Camp-Fire of Lincoln Post
No. 1 at >Â°ative Son-.' Hall.
Lincoln Post of the Grand Army of the
Republic held an old-time camp-tire social
last night at Native Sons' Hall. The
tables were devoid of cloths, silver or crys
tal; but there was no lack of beans n^r of
beer, the last-named article on the menu
being replaced by coffee for the disciples
of good Father Mat hew, who, sooth to
say, seemed much in ihe minority.
Commander H. W. Mortimer, the genial
chief officer of the post, gave a glamour
of Testive luxury to the Spartan simplicity
of the bill of fare by presenting each of
the guests with a draught of Pommery
Sec when the pipes and tobacco were
brought on. During the meal tb? Letter
carriers' band discoursed a select pro
gramme of classic and popular music, and
when the curling clouds of smoke com
menced to ascend story-telling was in
order.
Mr. Mortimer told some of the biggest
yarns he is ever known to have told,
which is by no means saying little.
Stories were related and addresses made
by Past Department Commander Charles
E. Wilson, General W. H. L. Barnes, the
Hon. A. J. Buckles of Suisun, Colonel C.
Mason Kinne and Colonel W. R. Smed
berg. Nor was music lacking, all present
joining in the choruses to the songs. It
was long past midnight before the en
joyable event was brought to a close with
tne singing of "Auld Lang Syne."

The owners of Chinatown properties
that have been condemned or are even
likely to be condemned, have begun to
realize that the Board of Health means
business and that the buildings will be
torn down unless they are protected by
legal process.
Some days ago Health Officer Lovelace
reported the condition of a number of
structures that were in bad sanitary con
dition, recommending their condemna
tion, and yesterday the beard made an in
spection to see whether the report should
be carried out. It was found that tbe
two shanties at 8 and 10 Card alley bad
been removed by the owners. Buildings
at 928 Ciay street, 10 Brooklyn place and
four small structures on an alley running
off Valiejo between Montgomery and San
some streets were condemned and will be
torn down unless removed by the owners
within ten days.

Freud under the direction of the Com
mittee on Press and Publications of the
Citizens' Charter Association :

What Is a city charter? A.â is the or
ganic law of a city, Just as the constitution is
the fundamental law of the State.
Q.â ls it a question of party politics? A.â No:
a charter has nothing to do with party poli
tics. It affects all political parties alike.
Q. â Is it a question of persons or individ
uals? A.â No; it has nothing whatever to do
with persons. All individuals and officials are
affected equally.
Q.â What then is the main result of a new
charter? A.â chief result is a change in
the system or method of governing a city.
Q.â Do citizens change or amend their char
ters often? A.â Every progressive city changes
or amends its charter whenever found neces
sary.
(Iâ What are the principal reasons? A. â On
account of rapid growth, new conditions, ad
vanced ideas, improved methods or higher
standards.
CHAPTER II.â GOVERNMENT OP SAN FRANCISCO.
Q. â^Vhatconstitute^ the present government
of San Francisco? A.â lt consists of many
special acts of the Legislature of California.
When was it made? A.â The first or
original part was made in 1856. ,
Q.â How often has it been changed or altered?
A. Every Legislature during the past forty
years has changed, amended, supplemented or
repealed parts of the original act.
Q. â What is the name of this complex produc
tion 1 A.â lt is generally called the "consolida
tion act."
Q.â How large was San Francisco In 1856? A.
It was a tradine-post of about 40,000 people.
Q.â What other new conditions nave arisen

Francisco then was from the mines; now It is
from agriculture, commerce and manufactures.
Q.â ls the consolidation act suited to the
present wants ol San Francisco? A.â San
Fra Cisco has outerown the consolidation act,
and it is as little suited to the requirements of
this City as a boy's clothes would be suited to
a man.

cisco generally understood? A.â In fact,
no one can tell with certainty the exact laws
upon many municipal questions.
Qâ What are some of the results of the con
solidation act? A.â special laws, legislative
tyranny, official chaos, municipal extrava
gance and corruption, political patronage,
monopolies in all public utilities ana decay of
the City. .â /.â¢.
(To be continued.)
CITY OR COUNTY?
The Supreme Court TVJII Be Asked
to Modify Its Decision
on the Act.
Garret W. McEnerney said yesterday
that the Supreme Court would be asked to
modify its opinion in the county govern
ment act case. He believed that the
county government act did not apply to
San Francisco. He stood on the record
as Having won the ca&e, yet he knew that
he was beaten.
"Unless the decision is modified it seems
to me it will plun ge our affairs into an un
bearable state of uncertainty and doubt,
though, of cour-e, if the decision be right,
if it be sound, if it be the correct construc
tion of our political system, it ought to
stand," added Mr. McEnerney.
The point at issue seems to be that
under the opinion Kan Francisco will be
left without several county officers re
quired under the constitution. If the
Treasurer and the Auditor are City of
ficials and not County officers the opinion
of the Supreme Court will have robbed
this County of most of her officials.

Strange Accident That Horrifiad the
Guests of the Miramar
Yesterday.
Gustav Stabl, 9 years of age, met with a
shocking accident, which resulted in his
death, at the Miramar Hotel, 703 Geary
street, where he was livine with his
mother, yesterday afternoon. The boy,
who was playing with his younger brother
and another boy, named Gerald Brown,
proposed that they slide down the banis
ters of the hotel.
They went to the fourth floor of the
building and after a few moments' sport
Gustav decided to slide down head first.
He started, but lost his balance and
plunged head first down the stair well.
He struck on the lower banister and fell
unconscious to the floor. He was picked
up and carried to his motber'B room and
a physician was summoned.
After examining the boy's injuries he
sugcested that he be removed to the
French Hospital. This was done, but the
injured boy never recovered conscious
ness. He died last evening. His mother
in prostrated over the death of her son,
but being satisfied that his death was due
solely to accident and was the fault of no
one waived an inquest. The boy's body
was removed irom the hospital to Leopold
Moss', his grandfather's residence, 1818
O'Farrell street.
The Drive Was Kept Wet.
Superintendent Reddy of the Almshouse has
recently caused the cutting of some trees along
the road between the Almshouse and Ingle
side. These were not near the Almshouse.
They had been complained of because they kept
the road damp and muddy, -o that driver- on
the war to and from Ingleside were incon
venienced. Superintendent Reddy says that
he whs requested to take this action by promi
nent citizens, and that it will result in beuefit
to all concerned. All these trees would soon
have been cut, in any instance, by the run
uing of the boulevard.
No Corroborative Evidence.
The case against Charles Pscherhofer, real
estate agent, charged with obtaining money
by false pretenses, was dismissed by Judge
Campbell yesterday. The complaining wit
ness was Mrs. Anna Swissig, who alleged that
Pscherhofer sold her two lots last month in
Su;roville Addition, near Stockton, but the
lots in her dee l were not the same that Pscher
hofer pointed out to her at the time of the
purchase. This Pscherhofer denied, and the
ca^e was dismissed for lack of corroborative
evidence.

Since time immemorial the standard of
feminine loveliness has ever beenâ and, for
tuat matter, still isâ a moot question.
The ancient poet sang in wild discordant
notes of coral lips, low overhanging brow
and distended nostrils.
The sweet singers of Greece tuned their
lyres to tell of Ion? supple limbs, a figure
like that of a godless and perfection of
features.
The whole world then had but one ideal,
and it perpetuated her in song, in painting
and in sculpture.
Her influence was all permeating, and
so thoroughly was the time imoued with
her that it wns close to the end of the
seventeenth century before she ever began
to relax her hold.
The moderns, with the exception of the
painter and the sculptor, set up for wor
ship a bewildering array of idols. Milo's
Venus was relegated to obscurity and for
getfulness.
Tall ideals, short ideals, ideals with soft
rounded limbs and ideals whose paucity
of flesh scarcely concealed the angularity
of their bones were scattered broadcast.
The novelist then became the most pro
lific expounder of the ideal. He took
many liberties with the idol. He gave
her a mien severe anu then again a sunny,
dimpling smile. He added or subtracted
at will from the recognized classic length
of limb. He devoted mellifluous and
abundant phrase to the description ol her
eyes. He crowned her with a golden
mesh or an ebony coronet. With one ex
ception he took no liberties with her
classic features. Now and then he
chipped off the very tip of her inspiring
nose and coined the phrase retrousse to
explain his sin.
So long had the majority looked to the
romancer to explain his ideal that the
fin de siecle novelist, who indulges in no
descriptions and hints vaguely at soul in
fluence, left it with nary a leg to stand
on.
Then, to add to the perplexities of the
day, there is that ambiguous expression
unmistakably of woman's coinage â the
man's beauty.
This new idol is the most mystifying of
all. The woman explains her variously,
delightfully indefinitely, with ruoues and
shrugs that convey much but mean little.
With the men apparently lay the solu
tion, and being ever of an inquiring mind
I made my pilgrimage among the promi
nent men of the Ciiy, discovering little
that was new but eliciting mucd valuable
information.
I know for a certainty that man's
beauty is in many cases much the same as
womnn's accepted standard; that there
is a Darby for every Joan. . I have per
force lost all faith in the much-vaunted
affinity of opposites. I have had proof
positive that all men do not marry their
ideals; that some men have not forgotten
the trick of bJush-ng, and that ail deep
down in their hearts have set up an idal,
which to them represents the acme of the
truly noble and beautiful, and at her
shrine all bow with devotion and rever
ence.
James Phelan was the first victim of my
inquisition and a graceful victim he was.
Smiling and serene he met the ail impor
tani question and answered wiih firmness
and precision. I listened attentively while
he explained the goddess of his dream. His
exposition was of more value than be ever
could imagine. I snew he was the presi
dent of the Art Association and a man of
rare intelligence, a pas-ionate admirer of
the beautiful. Further, 1 knew he is con
sidered the greatest matrimonial prize nf

GREATER THAN
A HUMAN EYE
JKe Gamera's Visior\
Is Widened
Photographs Jaken by the Cylin
drograph Exhibited at
the Fair
The latest invention in field photography
is called the cylindrograph. This is an
improvement even upon the human eye,
and by its use a much wider range of al
most any given subject may be imprinted
on the negative than can be taken in by
the nafced eye.
Excellent specimens of this work may
be seen at the -outhwest corner of the
gallery in the Mechanics' Pavilion, where
there is an unoDtiusive group of photo
graphs, which is a sample of the photog
raphy done in connection with the field
work of the California State Mining Bu
reau during 1*95-96.
These pictures were, at the request of
the management committee of the Me
chanics' Fair, donated by Mr. Crawford,
the State Mineralogist, to the Mechanics'
Institute, and th-ey comprise excellent
specimens of the work of the field assist
ants of the California State Mining Bu
reau. These picture> illustrate chiefly the
topography and neology of the oil fields of
Southern California, and many of them
are remarkable for having been taken
v. ith the latest form of apparatus used in
field photography, the cyiindrograph.
This instrument has.a compass which is
even greater than the angle of vision, and
the pictures made with it give a more
comprehensive idea of the topography of
a locality than any picture which can be
made by other means. There are also
smaller pictures, which are well executed
and are very instructive, especially the
ones illustrating: the oil springs of Ventura
County.
The "last-mentioned photographs show:
First, an oil spnne; second, a stream of
maltha or heavy viscous petroleum â this
picture demonstrating how the oil from
the spring, after losing its most volatile
constituents by exposure to the air, crawls
down the mountainside in a stream of
niineral tar or maltha, as ii is technically
tailed; third, se-pa. es of petroleum from
n-^ures in hard sandstone roc
The most striking ol the cyjindrotypea
of his c oice the teieeraph will flash the
news to all tho four corners of the globe
and in a six-head will the newspapers an
nounce the engagement to an admiring
and curious public.
He parried my first question, "Lay
bare my soul," and then he found a re
porter, who, in quest of news, knows no
mere}', and deciaed that he could do no
better than quote what Bancroft said his
ideal of California's effigy should be:
"She should be large and supple- limbed;
low-browed, with a flood of golden hair
veiling her exquisitely molded form;
deep-blue eyes, whose dreamy languor a
merry recklessness sadly should disturb;
nose and chin Grecian; ripe, luxurious
lips; while expression, voice and attitude
should all betoken an indolent, romantic
nature, overflowing with high, exultant
spirits."
His quotations were interspersed with
telling asides. Mr. Bancroft's historical
statements have been questioned and
James .f helan reserved the right of differ
ing from his views.
"A flood of golden hair" came under
his displeasure. "Golden hair, no," and
there was the same repetition after "She
should be large * * * low-browed."
But one thing there is no mistaking, Mr.
Phelan's ideal is a California girl.
Major Rathbone was for a moment non
plused at what he considered the very
audacity of my question. Then a look of
fear came over the gallant Major's coun
tenance. "Tell my ideal?" he at last
found tongue to murmur. "I have too
many lady friends. Why, they would say,
'The old wretch! how dare he.' "
But he dared. To Major Rathbone all
I women are beautiful angels â minus the
: wings. And figuratively speaking, the
Major suggests the thought that his only
recret is that his good right arm is not
! long enough to encircle the entire feminine
population of the globe.
There io Southern biood in Allen St. J.
I Bowie's veins, and his tastes are those of
the South. First of all no woman is so
beautiful in Mr. Bowie's eyes as a South
ern woman. If he is fortunate enough to
realize his ideal, she will be a brunette,
tall and stately and Juno like. Her limbs
will be well rounded. Neither flashy nor
thin will she be, but of those proportions
the uninitated are wont to de cribe as just
right. Her eyes will be black as sloes, her
skin like cream. She must be fashionable,
â¢ not necessarily fond of so. iety. Her voice
must, like Cordelia's, be soft and low and
her carriage queenly. She may have as
many fads as she likes so long as they do
not conflict. Above all she must be
musically inclined.
I have concluded that the happiest solu
tion to the question, "Why are you a
bachelor?" is susceptibility. I bave found
a living example, and there is no refuting
that.
Edward 8* eidon, who could be leaderof
ihe four hundred if he only said so,
trembled at my question. He is my liv
ing example. "1 have not one ideal. I
am too susceptible. And then at present
I am living in Sausalito, where there are
so many pretty girls. My head is all in a
whirl." Now, which is it? Happy Sau^a
lito or happy Mr. Sheldon?
A. H. Small prayed for time before he
answered the all-absorbing question. His
prayer was granted, and then, after
twenty-four hours for r> flection, Mr.
Small decided that I might just as well
ask him to paint a pictureâ an impossible
feat for him. Mr. Small acknowledged
himself swamped by the very immensity
of the problem.
I put the question to Mr. Bouvier dur
REMARKABLE CYLINDROGRAPHIC VIEW OF BITUMINOUS SLATES FORMATION ON SANTA PAULA CREEK, VENTURA COUNTY.
[From a photograph now on exhibition at the Mechanics' Institute Fair, taken by W. L. Walts,]
re two panoramic views, each of which
is formed by joining two cylindrograph |
picture*. One of these views shows the I
Santa Paula Canyon in Ventura County,
and the mountain ridge which has been
cut through by the Santa Paula Creek.
The other view, which is taken from a
point on the southwest slope of Mount
Cayetana, also in Ventura County, gives
an extensive view of the oil districts which
are situated ;o the north of the town 01
Santa Paula. It embraces several moun
tain ridges witli their valleys and foothills.
One of the cylindroeraph pictures shows
the Second-street Park oilfield in Los
An.eles City with its forest of derricks,
each of which indicates an oil well. This
picture gives a good idea of the way the
paraphernalia of the petroleum industry
are mixed up wiih the residences in the
part of Los Angeles which is shown.
Not the least instructive scene is one
which shows the way the tunnel- which
arc run for oil are ventilated by what is
known as a hydraulic air-compressor. This
view also shows the manner of illuminat
ing these tunnels by reflected sunlight.
These precautions are necessary on ac
couni of the inflammable eas which tills
these tunnela and which, in more than
one instance, has occasioned loss of life.
We are told that when the air-compressor
is not running some of these oil tunnels
become filled with the deadly gas in a few
hours, so that it would be impossible to
live in them for many minutes and that to
light a match therein would be certain
j death. These tunnels are run to cut through
the oil-yielding neks from which oil and
water flow and arr conducted by a gutter in
the floor of the tunnel to receiving tanks,
wherein the oil separates from the water
and is stored.

Various Ideals of
Fenr\ir\ir\e LoVelirvess
"As to an opinion about blondes or
brunettes, that is too dangerous a ques
tion for a man who has many friends. 1 '
Claude Terry Hamilton shrieked a dis
cordant "Which?" to my simple little
question as to his ide:;lof feminine loveli
ness. And then he blushed and he stam
mered and he laughed and then blushed
again. I wonder, oh I wonder who she is,
Mr. Hamilton?
A. B. Costigan felt he needed time be
fore answering the all-important question.
He had an ideal, but bo prosaic a proceed
ing as picturing her in words had never
presented itself to Mr. Costigan. So he
went over to the quiet shades of Tiburon,
thought the matter over and here is a
copy of the description he mailed me:
"Her nair niusl be of a reddish hue, v.-ith
a disposition that is amiable at all times.
Not necessary be pretty, but with eyes
that speak at every glance. Musically in
clined and some thought given to society.
Fond of outtoor life and a, mind that is all
her own. Dwells very little on the subject |
of dress and occasionally speaks a good
word for woman suffrage, and if she were
a man, would be a rank Republican.
"Her general character should be inimi
table."
President Dohrmann of the Merchants'
Association represents the concentrated
business ability of this City. His ideal,
on that account alone, is not one to be
sneezed at. When first questioned Mr.
Dohrmann pleaded his age as an excuse,
but after a little coaxing gracefully yielded
up his secret, and thus spoke ie: "My
father, who lived to the ripe old age of 83,
followed this motto through life, and I,
seeing the wisdom of his course, have
adopted it: 'All wine is good, but some is
better: all women are beautiful, but some
are handsomer.' "
His profession probably accounts for the
minuteness with which Cnarles Heggerty
entered into the description of his ideal,
one of those creations we feel sure inhabit
the skies, but disdain to visit this ter
restrial sphere.
This is ali that Lawyer Heggerty wants.
A brunette. Five feet six inches tall.
Her eyes are liquid brown. Her complex
ion clear and in her cheeks should glow
the clear bluish red, like the spark from a
live coal. Under no condition must her
nose be pointed sharply, nor retrousse. It
must be a nose Jik that which adorns the
features of Milo's Venus, and of course in
perfect keeping with the proportions of
her face. Her mouth must be small. The
lips bow shaped, not thin, not thick, and
the lower lip must protrud just the
veriest shadow of a bit. Her teeth must
be small, even and white. She should
run to fle^h rather than bones, and have
just mind enough to read a paper and to
enable her to catch the boat.
Iv her home polities! discussions must
|be tabooed. The learned barrister would
far ra her discuss with his idol her old
hat which she had spent the whole day in
"fixing over" than the solar or lunar
eclipse. Her figure must be trim, her
waist in healthful proportion. There
must be no padding, and, above all, she
dare not be pigeon-toed. She must carry
herself erect, and ncr body should 3wing
with an easy grace. Above all things she
must n t care for society. She must
grumble when she has to put on a street
dress, and it must be next to impossible
to induce her to go out.
Manager Frawley's ideal has no com
plexion. Neithei is she facially beauti
ful. She is a womanly woman, dainty
and petite â a woman that a man feels he
should like to tight for. She certainly has
a mind. But the less she reads editorials
Queen, who conferred it on him the day of
his marriage with Princess Louise Vic
toria, eldest daughter of the Prince and
Princess of Wales. The founder of the
family was Adam Duff, a Scotch peddler,
who lived at the beginning of the eight
eenth century.
Uncle Sam cannot get it into his head
that William Waldorf Astor, grandson of
John Jacob Astor, a German peddler,
should be any more incapable than the
Duke of Fife of cutting a good ti ure at
court with the title of Duke of Clivedon.
given by her gracious Majesty the day of
his marriage with her granddaughter.
When it comes to choosing between these
two descendants of peddlers Uncle Sam
naturally inclines toward hi 3 multi
millionaire nephew, who would, in his
eyes, add a considerable quantity of gild
ing to the Princess' escutcheon.
It is said that the English aristocracy
shares his ideas on this point. For ex
ample, the Duchess of Buccleuch, chief
lady in waiting to the Qiuen, who was
formerly very hostile to the invasion o:
Americans, has now accepted more than
one invitation to Clivedon; and there are
Couniess Cowper, the Marchioness of Lon
donderry and a number of other women of
the aristocracy, whose high influence has
contributed to Introduce the American
millionaire into intimacy with the Prince
of Wales, and who have enGed by regard
ing him as a possible pretendent to the
| hand of Princess Victoria.
The son of American democracy, on the
j steps of the British throne, seated one day
perhaps as Prince Consort beside the
Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, Em
press of India, etc. Nothing appears
more exciting to the Americans and noth
ing strikes them as being more natural.
the better is Mr. Frawley going to like
her. There is to be a lot of romance
mixed up in her composition. She will
enjoy a walk and w ar (poor benighted
m;Â«n in the days of numbers 5 and 6) a
3% or 4 shoe. She ia to enjoy exercise.
She is to be no Bociety lady. She is to
love horses and dogs and pretty gowns;
be musical; read the "Tale of Two Cities"
and "Night and Morning-," bat, oh, how
he should hate her to read detective
stories. The less she knows about house
hold duties the better. She is to De his
pal, his companion, and must not punch
baps.
Probably no man is more sought after in
social circles than Harry Stetson. He
shines especially as best man at swell
weddings. He nas had every opportunity
to meet the best the land affords, and con
sequently his ideal is of more than passing
interest.
It is a woman with olive skin and large
dark eyes that is especially attractive for
; Mr. Stetson. She is tall and slender and
carries herself well. She cares not for
politics. She is well versed in literature
and art. She is fond of society to a mod
erate extent. She is musically and gen
erally accomplished and athletic to a cer
tain extent.
Joullin, the artist, worships at the shrine
of Donatillo's famous statue, "La Femme
Inconnu." Looking at the cold marble
he feels she must have had a wonderful
mind. Physical beauty and mental at
tainments the artist contends are one and
inseparable.
In the flesh Joullin's ideal is the Eng
lish beauty. For him she more nearly
approaches the clastic. She has a fine fig
ure, a stately carriage.
It is many a day since there has been a
leading man in this City more beloved of
the matinee girl than Frank Worthing.
She hangs his picture in her blue or
white boudoir, and some, I am informed
on most reliable authority, burn inceuse
constantly before it. I do not know ex
actly what the actor thinks of newspaper
people, but I know my reportorial pres
ence succeeded in scaring him most to
death. His lips were blanched. The
veins stood out on his forehead like pieces
of whip-rord. My question evidently re
assured him. "Feminine loveliness alto
gether? Mental and physical? Maxine
Elliott. She represents my ideal, don't
you know? She is perfection, don't you
know? So beautiful, so simple, so un
affected, don't you know? So loyal; so
true; so unselfish." And in Worthing's
rather expressionless eyes there shone a
light that moved tue. So unselfish.
And she is going to marry Nat Good
â¢ win. Ah, Worthing ' you juuge other peo
| pie by yourself.
Dr. Voorsanger at first declined to be
interviewed on what to him meant so ex
; haustive a subject. In ideal womanly
loveliness he saw a theme that required
deep thought and considerable time to
j formulate his opinion-. For him it was
an c hical question â one not to be lightly
dwelt upon. "Say for me," said the
learned gentleman, "that handsome is as
1 hand.-ome does. That is the best I can
say in a lew words on a subject I feel so
deeply."
Ideal loveliness has no physique, no out
ward form for Dr. L. Bazet. The
neauty of woman for him lies in the life
spark that animates her soul. It is the
intangible, the incomprehensible some
thing that spurs men on to nobler better
things. Tlie power that awakens his
j higher ambitions, the soul which makes
i him strive and cry, "I will be noble, I will
| be gr^at, I will be worthy of you."

And then the idea is such a novelty. Up
till now American princesses and duch
esses have abounded, but an American
princeâ Prince Astor, Duke of Clivedonâ
would be an entirely new departure. Of
course he would have to be naturalized in
England, if be is not already naturalized.
But Astor is of American origin, and he
would remain American at heart and in in
terest, which would suffice for Uncle Sam.
People are talking already of the wed
ding tour, which would naturally be in
America. Prince Astor would not fail to
show his bride a house situated at Sault
Ste. Marie, on Lake Ontarioâ a house of
very singular construction its balconied

I sort of fortress, with loopholes, which

Tae man who built it was a poor Ger

1783. He made it a headquarters lor trad
ing in furs with the Indians. In 1812
when the war between the United States
and England interfered with his business
he realized his little pile and found that
he had gained two million dollars. Then
he bought tracts of land near New York.
His name was John Jacob Astor.
The tracts of land to-day are traversed
Iby Fifth avenue and Broadway. Such is
the origin of the fortune of $230,000,000, of
which a part belongs to William Waldorf,
Prince Astor.
Alter visits to palaces, mansions and

possible that the Princess will ba curious

Two years ago her casket was covered with
3800 orchids at a dollar apiece, and until
it was consigned to the earth the florist
had orders to renew the fljwers every

THE STRANGEST SCHOOL DISTRICT IN AMERICA
A few weeks aeo a little, modest peti- J

before the Board of School Directors. In
brief, its message was, "Send us a school

pathos in this little petition could not be
understood without a knowledge of the
environments of tbe petitioners and of the

licitous.
Surrounded by the deep Pacific Ocean

HIS LUCKY FIND
The Man Who Discovered the Bald
Eagle Mine in Alaska
E. F. Schumacher, one of the discoverers
of the famous Bald Eaple mine on Sum
dum Bay, between Si;ka and Wrangel,
fifty miles from Dou.'las Island, is at the
Commercial. Mr. Schumacher and his
partners have sold this mine to N. A.
Trowbridge of this City for $60,000, and
Schumacher, after many years of pros
pecting, has settled down to the enjoy
ment of the neat fortune he now has at his
command.
The gentleman was one of the forty or !
more starving miners who were rescued by j
the tJnited States steamer Tlietis on the I
Lower Yukon a few years ago after they j
had made sundry explorations on the Yu- j
kon and its tributar e&, failing to find any
gold of consequence. The country was
then very new and it was not known
whether ;'.oid existed in large quantities i
or not.
Mr. Schumacher had previously Dros
pected in different Pacific Coast States
and Territories. He bad found some
small-paying prorerties, and sold them
each time for what he could get. The
money he usually expended in prospect
ing again. Altogether he has had many
strange and romantic episodes in his life.
He is a medium-sized gentleman, a type
of the free and independent prpspector,
who more resembles the fur hunter of the
old days than any other class of men we
now hare. He appears to be about 45
years old. For more than twenty years
most of hi* time has been given to going
over the hi Is wilt pack on bis back and
outfitted otherwise with pick, pan and
magnifying glass.
"I had at different times made a number
of stakes prior to finding the Bald Eagle,"
said Mr. Schumacher, "but they were
small. 1 would take what I made from
them and start out again usually, and try
mining again. Once or twice I started in
business, but I found I was ill-suited to it.
Tiie free ways I had contracted as a miner
illy fitted me to adopt the ways of the
average business man, and I soon got out
of business and went to prospecting once
more.
"When I got broke, as 1 not infrequently
did, I went to work in some mine for a
few months till 1 made a stake. Then I
struck out again, i risked everything I
had, and if I didn't find anything, why
then 1 had to begin over again. It was win
or lose every time. But this was better
and much more independent than sitting
uround in San Francisco and trying to beat
tbe stock market. I was quite happy all
tbe time I was Out, though I had some
very rough times.
"When tbe Thetis picked me up. for in
stance, along with a lot more hungry and
ragged miner?, after we had spent many
months on the Yukon, I had just s 9.
"After I had got pulled together a little,
and began to feel a little natural again, 1
went over to Douglrs island and began to
work in the big gold mine there at $2 a
day. I put in the winter, and then having
a little stake I started out once more to
try to find a mine of my owr.
"Three other miners, Reed, Robinson
and Clark, were ready to try luck with
me. So we al 1 set out. We were equipped
in the rougb way of prospectors in that
country, and getting over to the main
land elowly worked our way along the
coast and through the hills, digging
wherever we thought we might find a
ledge.
"In the course of several weeks we ar
rived at a curious place near the shores of
Sumdum Bay. There seemed to be a
ledge there. There was an outcropping
of dark yellowish looking; stuff. We dug
into it and threw aside some specimens,
but didn't think much about them, for
they didn't look very good.
"While we were thinking whether we
would stake out the claim or not, I looked
up and saw a lot of bald eagles sailing
around. I had seen them before, but had
paid no attention to them. Suddenly it
occurred to me I would call it the Bald
Ea^ie mine. It was a pood name, 1
thought. I mentioned it to my partners,
they agreed to it, and we put down a
single stake, with our names on it, to
gether with the name 'Bald Eagle,'
which we had decided on.
"A while after this we appeared in Sitka
with pieces of the ledge, which we had
brought to be assayed. When I took them
to the assayer be counted them all out,
and there were ten in all. None of us
bad been impressed with their appear
ance. The assayer said, as be chipped off
some little pieces for assay:
trable vapor, and while the sturdy men
who tend the light and keep the siren
going are busied at their lonely posts
their families, th'ir little children, be
leaguered by all the sea, sleep far away
from city joys and diversions and com
panionships. Through the darkness,
above the sound of the breaking waves,
booms the fog siren, answered by its
hoarse neighbor at Point Reyes, and its
blasts fall upon the ears of the beleaguered
listeners with the regularity of the tolling
of a bell that might be rung by implacable
fate, doling out life in periods.
There are eight rosy little children on
the South Farallon and two older ones.
They are there because their parents are
earning a living for themselves and their
families in the Government service main
taining the light and the siren. It was in
their behalf that their parents have asiced
for a teacher. Ten children are all the
pupiis there are in this strangest "school
district" in all the earth. They have one
room fitted up for school purposes in
which there are little desks, benches and
blackboards and a supply of schoolbooks,
a globe, which represents the round earth
of which they occupy so small a portion,
and that time-honored institution, the
teacher's desk. From the windows of the
schoolroom and nard by is the engine
house and siren-house, one furnishing the
voice which comes from the other, punc
tuating the wash of the waters and the
voices of the children and their teacher â
when they have one. Daring a certain
season of about three months' duration
hundreds of thousands of sea birds, in
great flights, circle about the schoolhouse,
with their discordant cries, and settle
upon the barren rocks, where they make
their nests.
As the children study their thoughts are
led to wander by the occasional sight of
a passing ocean steamer laden with many
passengers who seem to be free to come
and go, and the steamer and its freedom
stimulates tbeir imagination before and
after it sinks into oblivion below the far
" 'Well, I won't look at any of this, and
when you get your result you will know
that it is fair and uninfluenced in any
way.'
"Then he turned his head the other,
way while he chipped off a little piece Irom
each of the ten specimens.
"Well, from those he made hi* assay
and what do you suppose he got? Wiiy
it was enough to drive us wild, and he was
filled with excitement as to where the
rock came from and tbe extent of it.
"The assay made in this manner showed
$300 in gold to the ton, and $70 in silver.
You can depend on it we were not long in
gutting back there and surveying off the
claim. We had left it after driving but a
Bingie stake. Now we were going to put
down all four, describe its dimensions by
| a more elaborate notice, to be duly
printed, and also lay off such other claims
as we could on the ledge.
"We lost not a minute of time. It was
plain we had a good thing. When we got
back we did all this in the most expe
| ditious manner and then commenced
sinking on the ledge. Tbe property showed
up well. After a time, however, we got out
of money, anÂ«l as we were a long way from
any phtce where we could get *uch are
smelted as we had we bonded the mine to
J. B. Haggin & Co. of this City for $50,000.
Their expert, MÂ»\ Keller, ran a tunnel
that cost about $10,0u0, but he missed the
ledge by a little, an-i just then the Baring
failure occurred and orders came to close
down the work. They wouldn't take it.
"Then Trowbridge came along. He
wanted us to set a price on the mine. By
this time I didn't want to sell at all. I
had become convinced that we bad a big
thing and that by hook or crook we could
hold on to it. I pointed out that we could
borrow a few hundred dollars on it and
pet a little prospector' 3 stamp mill of a
couple of stamps. But my partners were
a little weak. They were afraid, and
thought we had better do the safe thing.
"So we raised the price up $10,000 more,
[ making it $60,000 altogether, this covering
the cost of the tunnel development, which
I considered an atiding just so much value
to the mine, and we sold the Bald Eagie
out and out. Mr. Trowbridge paid us $10,
-000 down. He put or. a couple of two
stamp mills soon afterward, and the whole
remaining $50,000 he got out of the mine.
He didn't have to put up another c.nt of
outside money.
'â¢The mine to-day, too, is worth $500,000.
There are a lot of black suloburets in it,
and these run as high as $1000 a ton. The
quartz is nearly clear white, with iron py
rites dotted, through it and plainly visible.
It is what is called live ore, and has to be
roasted or concentrated.
Who_Can_Tell Whether Victor or Vanquished Fought Harder ?
We have often discussed the Successes of
life. Let us talk a little of its failures.
These are fewer than most people think.
I doubt very much if any man's life is en
tirely a failure. Only the man who has
never tried is utterly a failure. It was the
novelist Dickens who said, "No one knows
whether it was the victor or the van
quished who fought the bravest battle."
If there is any truth at all in the theory
of the conservation of energy; jf there is
justice in thÂ« universe, then it follows
naturally that every time we try in the
rigbt direction we gain something. We
are too prone to judges failure or success
by immediate results. In truth, can we
not go a step farther than Dickensand say,
"No one knows whether the victor or the
vanquished is tbe real winner." This is
paradoxical, but those who wish to will
see the pointâ that what appears to be
success iB sometimes failure, and vice
versa.
What, then, is success in lifef
It is a question tliat has been answered
times without number but that confront*
us still. Like tbe query, "What is truth ?"
it remains without a final answer for the
reason tbat every reply which is given is
necessarily determined by the standard
we choose to apply. As truth is, for any
individua', that measure of the truth
which he is able to grasp, so tnust^nuccess
mean to him dimply that kind of achieve
ment whose value he can best apurecia'e.
But there Is another factor too often
overlooked in determining what is suc
cess. If we consider only the immediate
* result of endeavor we shall fail to discern

DR. DE VECCHI'S GIFT TO THE ART INSTITUTE
Tbe little statue that has lately been placed in the napkins Insti
tute of Art, the gift of Dr. P. de Vecchl of this City, attracts greater
attention from visitors as the days go by. It U, in fact, one of the j
most attractive pieces of sculpture in San Francisco and the more one '
sees of it the more they want to see. It grows on one.
Acfireful Â«tuly of the little work of art wiil readily reveal the
cause of this, although it is necessary to search deeper for the groat
merit, from an artistic standpoint, of the statue; and after all this is
the m^st interesting.
The statue represents "Beatrice Cenci in Prison," and it is the
work of Lamberto Gorla, a young sculptor at present residing in Rome
and well advanced on the road to 6uccess. The work received a medal
at the last exhibition of the Italian sculptor.", and well did it deserve
it. To begin with, the statue is beautiful and the sentiment expressed
appeals to a!!. It is as simple a subject as it is Dossible to conceive
and yet there is a dignity about it that al once raises it above tha
ordinary.
In carrying on? thi" work the sculptor has not followed any par
ticular Mjhool, but hat rather made an effort to mingle the classic with
the changes it effects as time goes on. Yet
these are otten marvelous transforma
tions. Not only may they so amend or
alter conditions as to make them seem al
together different, but t Â«y may even turn
them into a contrary nature.
Some effects are like a seed pianted out
of sight. Before its vitality can be dis
played in growth it is doomed to pass
through stages of decay. But it will
sprout and grow. Finally it will flower
and bear fruit, becoming the very oppo
site of that introductory decay. By a sim
ilar transformation seeming may be
converted into gain.
The failure to take account of this fact
undoubtedly tends to discourage efforts
that do not promise some speedy return.
It takes a sturdy faith to plant for the
future. The farmer knows that nature is
with him when he buries his seed. He
knows that sun and rain have wrought
the mystery of growth for untold ages, so
waits with entire confidence for the final
resuit. But he feels no such assurance
that time will resurrect a buried iabor.
He discerns no law of growth in affairs.
When his efforts bring no visible result,
he therefore counts it simple failure, and
judg s the wisdoai of bis action accord
ingly.
The same partial view of success is
largely responsible for tbat decline of en
thusiasm which usually accornDanies the
passage from youth to maturity. Tastes
that seemed so easy to the boy drop from
the man's discouraged hand. He thought
that wrongs could be righted by a little
argument; that moral suasion could

the children sometimes ride, comes to the

There are coal and supplies to be landed,
food, oil and the other articles which are
included in what are collectively known
as "light ship rations," and the donkey

which are not supplied by the solicitude
of the 70,000,000 persons who collectively

purchased out of the stores, which seem
so great and wonderful to the little fel
lows, and these are admired and wondered
at and drive a day's lessons out of the
heads of the sea-beleapuered babies.
Some of the children were born on the
South Farallon and they have not over
one excursion to the mainland per annum
to remember. In fact, also, as they have
grown oider their visitors have grown
fewer. Formerly there wern many visit
ors to the South Farallon. The heads of
he mrdern ; and he has succeeded, as the work shows. There is all of
the e, es.-ai.ee of the oid master* about the work, and at the same lime
U is full o! the dash and precision of the artists of the present time.
Furthermore, the work is highly original, both in conception and
treatment. The lines of the figures are gooil, and the modeling of the
drapery is beyond criticism, one might say. Nor does the work end
with the draperyâ there is & woman inside of it. The curves of the
graceful fleure are almost as apparent aa if they could be seen. The
drapery that fall" over them is carefully worked out, but not in the
least overdone. The musses are handled simp y, but at the same time
they indicate every plane and fold of the cloth.
But how shall the fuce on this beautiful work be described? It can
pot. There ii all the pathos, passion and resignation in it that is pos
sible to be shown with clay, and the r e is nlso an indicatiou of a senti
ment too Mibt'e to be anything but fleeting, it fÂ«vins.
Every part of this art work has received its just amount of atten
tion. Nothing is shitkea, nor is there any striving to get a certain ef
fect in a certain part at tha sacrifice or another part. It is an even,
conscientious piece of work, from whatever standpoint contsiderad.

easy to see where error lay. He would
show it to others and persuade them to do
what was right bj that Â«ll minhi become
better and happier. But in spite of plead-,
ing and argument the world seemed to
remain very much the same. Even those
who praised his ideas did not adopt them
in practice, but lived according to their
various natures as before.
How futile his effort appeared as he
looked back upon it! How wasted the
labor! So his heart grew ciiilled while
ths fervor of enthusiasm waned to dis
couragement, leaving him only the cold
"liLht of common day." Gradually his
mind became engrossed in selfish cares,
and in place of his old dream of purity and
nobility, he pursued the prizes offered by
the world. His thought dropped to lower
levels where motives to action could be
more easily maintained. Embittered,
perhaps, by his experience, he became a
clog to progress in place of the active
helper he had once been.

more than anything else, the getting of

and human desires are so largely material
in their nature that the wealth which con
trols supply \ b also able to direct the active
energies of men. Hero are palpable re
the four families there bad only a stated
amount of provisions and had no way to
immediately replenish their larders, and
so they could not entertain visitors.
Finally the intruders could not be consid
ered in any light other than a nuisance.
Their coming to the island was stopped
and the little schoolchildren knew that
they would be thrown more than ever be
fore on their own resources for diversion
and amusement
Tbe best way to point out the environ
ments of the schoolchildren of the South
Farallon may be to show what other
schoolchildren may have on the mainland.
Trips to Golden Gate Park or the country:
baseball g'mes and parties; the sights
and scenes of a great city, supplied with
cable and electric cars, museums, libra
ries, stores and ferry-boats, daily newspa
pers and crowds of children iÂ« one and
every school, with theaters and the occa
sional circus. Of course there are none of
these on the South Farallon.
A word concerning the library whicn
stilts. There is no waiting for the ger
mination of thought, or that transforma
tion in character which wotild make a
paradise on earth. Money cannot buy
happiness, it is true, but di<i he not resign
that riream long ago? Poetry may have
turned to proae, but certainly he has won
success.
Nevertheless, there lingers even in the
multitude that holds to this belief a vision,
in the abstract, of less sordid ideals. The
artist, delighting in the forms of beauty be
has created ; the poet, with heart of fire,
brin_ing into the common world ideas
from a radiant thought realm that stir the
soul to nobler aspiration; the patriot, for
the ransom of a people gladly giving bis
life; the philanthropist, pouring all be has
and is into others' lives for their upbuild
ingâare these not admired? And even
tlHiiii.h this multitude be neither able nor
willing to imitate their example, do they
not acknowledge that theirs has been the
loftier success?
It is the iear of failure that curbs many
a heroic impulse; the dread of irrepara
ble ioss. Jf we could only Know that
noble lives would not be followed by de
feat it would be easier to step into paths
leading to high achievement. Labor and
difficulty could be borne, for energetic
natures find their keenest enjoyment in
the overcoming of obstacles But who is
billing to risk all for a problematical good ?
The truth seem 9to be, however, that no
effort is in vain. It may not accomplish
all that we hoped for, but the result must
be equal to the cause that produced it.
Nature measures out her effects with
the Government supplies them with may
be interesting. It is truly a circulating
library in the widest aenee possible. It
consists of perhaps forty books, every one
of which is redolent of the salt brine of the
ocean, and every one of which has been
read and reread at some lighthouse station
on the Pacific Coast. The library is shifted
once every quarter. The books which
have done duty three months are all gath
ered up when the lighthouse tender comes
and are packed up to be taken away. In
the place of these another library of about
equal size, wnich has done dutyat?ome
otoer station, is put ashore. These are
not alone books of travel; they are trav
elers themselves, traveled booksÂ» which
have been read by other children.
There are no fads to be cultivatedâ no
collections of buttons or election cards.
In fact, the periodical excitements which
enlist the attention of the children of com
munities on the mainland are Known only
by name and mention to these dawning
little American citizens, for there is no
polling-place for voters on the island, and
no way for the four men who make their
homes off there to vote. There are no
bicycle races, for the ground is rough and
rocky for the most part. The exterior
View of the isiand is as forbidding almost
as is Point Reves. There are rabbits to
cbase over the rocks and some chickens to
enlist care and attention, and who knows
how the imaginations of these children
grow?
For instance, when the school children
of San Francisco, who, odd as it may
seem, are under the care of the same
Board of School Directors, are looking for
ward to the Christmas holidays and Santa
Claus, as pictured and imagined in all the
stores with Jive reindeer and Christmas
trees and glittering tapers, etc., there is a
time when tne little islanders in this
strangest school district on earth may
have s;ranpe fancies. There are no Christ
mas trees on the island, of course. If they
believe in the Beautiful Santa Claus myth
then old Krisa Kingle must be remodeled
A GREAT RUNNER
Some of the Remarkable Performances
of Lawrence E. Myers
Continuing on the biography of L. E.
Myers, the champion runner of twelve
years ago, I will speak of the man per
sonally as a preface to this article. He
was called the "'Manhattan Skeleton" â
a man of singularly Bpare build, being 5
feet 7 inches in height and weighing
108 pounds in training. He was slender
without being bony; good looking with
out being handsome. Jdis stride in 100
yards was nearly eight feet, and whan
running 600 yards his style was the most
graceful 1 have ever seen.
Last week I omitted quite an important
occurrence ii: Myers' career, namely:
Running seventy-five yards in 7% seconds,
on January 31, 1881. This record was for
many years associated with half a dozen
others as the best in America, though it is
now excelled by Cary's 7 3-5, but is valua- '
ble chiefly in displaying the wonderful all
round ability of the man.
On Myers' return from England he met
the California athletic delegation â Haley,
Belcher, Hawes and Stme. In a discussion
Myers and Hawes made a match to run
220 yards. Myers to give his opponent
twenty yards. Although the match was a
private one I managed to be present, on
September 15, 1881. The Californian won,
but not before Myers had passed 200 yards
in K% then set-ins that he could not catch
Hawes lie slowed a trifle and passed the
220 in 22^. Both remained record time
for some years. The course began on a
curve for about 100 yards and finished on
a straight. Later Myers told me that
Haley timed him (Myers) for one lap, 220
yards, on the old Manhattan track, a trial
alone, in 22JÂ£ seconds, and as I trained
with him a season on said track, and know
how he could tear around those sharp
curvs?, I believe him.
Before the fleet-footed Yankee left for
England a wealthy patron oi athletics and
admirer of Myers offered him a medal of
extraordinary value and beauty If he
would return unbeaten. When Mr. Sacks
heard of the succession of victories
achieved he rashly ordered a $500 tro; by
to be made â a marvelous creation. The
center was a Bhield â one-half United
States and one-half British, of gold enamel
and diamonds, surmounted by the flags of
the two countries of similar material.
Below this the records achieved by the
great runner were represented on gold
coins of different sizes strung on a chain
the arc of a circle, the 440 yard in the
center.
When Mr. Sacks received the unwel
come news that his favorite had been de
:eated in the 100-yard he realized that he
had" on his hands a trophy th^t could not
be presented for the purpose for which it
was contributed. On Myers' return hÂ«
rigid justice. So much cause, so much of
consequence, whether good or evil. If we
can be content with simple equity we may
rely upon her law, but her processes are
slow and harvest time cannot be hurried.
History furnishes abundant evidence to
this fact. Ho does practical life tuat lakes
account of a multitude of unrecorded acts
not less heroic, because the self-sacrifice
involved in them is never to be known.
These are not lost, even though the indi
viduals for whom sacrifice was made re
main ungrateful, for their silent influence
inspires ana encourages others to less self
ish living. And the great heroes, the
moral giants of humanity, are deathless
witnesses to the triumph of lofty endeavor.
Scan the long line of martyred saviors.
Rejected by the world, scorned by the rab
ble, ignored by orouu fools in haughty
places. The fngot and the rack were
theirs, too, and their lives went out in dis
honor. But they did not fail. Higher
than all others are ttieir names written on
the record of human successes. Their
ideas have become accepted creeds. Their
judgments guide the aspirations of a
world.
Did the Christ fail in his mission?
Surely no greater failure is recorded, if we
judge by events to the time of his crucitix
ion. But the seed that he planted in
human hearts grew into a mighty tree.
Fiona a handful of despised people his fol
lowers became nations, his croas became
an emblem of power, and the crucified
man of Calvary, who seemed to have lost
all, drew uato him a worshiping world.
Mebcib 3d. Tjjibds,
for them. How could Santa Claus reach
them ? Reacn them he does.
Does he sail across at early dawn, after
he has "flUed ud the stockings" and de
posited the gifts of love in city houses,
taking passage in a magic shallop and slid'
ing away as silently as he came on a keel
that leaves no wake? Christmas is apt to
be a stormy time at the Soutn Farallon
and landing is difficult, for "stormy breezes
blow." Santa Claus may therefore seem
to the little islanders to be rather Nep.
tune, or at least tbe prince of all sailors,
unafraid of storms and afraid only that
some of his little children may think
themselves foreotten at Christmas. The
parents arrange this and they are supposed
to be the most adept hiders of packages in
places where children can never find them
of any of all of Santa Claus' friends ana
faithful subjects on all the North American
continent.
A teacher is wanted in this queer.school
district. There have been several off
there. The last two were young ladies
who tauaht awhile and then sought once
more the more numerous attractions of
the shore. A gentleman taught there for
awhile and he found his little charges at-
tentive, bright and easily interested. Here
is a chance for any one who can appre
ciate the ever abiding majesty of the
ocean and who covets a quiet place in
which to read and reflect.
Goat Island, which has a juvenile popula
tion of school age, is unique in this, that
its school children daily sail back ana
forth in a launch to school. But Goat
Island is not a school district and the posi
tion of the South Farallon as the
strangest school district on earth caqnot
well be assailed. The South Farallon is
occupied by William A. Beeman, princi
pal keeper, and Cyrus J. Kane, Kichard H.
Williams and Lewis Englebrecht, assist
ants, and tbeir families. AU th^se, with
the exception of Mr. Englebrecht, have
lived on the South Farallon several
years. There are 250 applications for posi
tions under the Government at that point
decided to give it to him for a special per
formance at a joint meeting of the JN'ew
York and Manhattan Athletic clubs. A
scratch 300-yard run was made, Myers and
Belcher of California being the principal
entries. It iB scaroely necessary to say
that the race was a foregone conclusion.
The champion of England and America
made the pace a terrific one, and having
things all his own way came down tho
finish a winner by many yards in record
time â 31J4 seconds. He then became pos
sessor of the finest medal, probably, that
was ever won by a runner. For my
part, I have never seen its equal any
where.
Tbe following week, September 24, 1881,
was the occasion of the annual champion
ship meeting, and Myers has seldom
shoved off to better advantage than on
that day. He beean the afternoon's work
by winning the 100-yard race. As he
reached a point#bout five yards, possibly
ten yards from the tape, he threw up his
hands and turned his head. In this
position he crossed the tape in. the re
markaDiy fast time â under the circum-
stances â of 10}^ seconds. After winning
the 220-yard in comparatively slow time,
he went out for the quarter-mile. As
might be supposed, he won this by a broad
margin, but the time was notable, 49 2-5,
for it was the fastest time ever made at
the annual championship meeting, and
remains so until this day.
On October 8 the American Athletic
Club, of which I later became a member,
gave a set of games. The meeting was
memorable for two things: The first im
portant win of Wendell Baker, who cap
tured the 100-yard handicap fom the
5-yard mark, I think, in 10 seconds,
but particularly for Myers' appearance in
the 1000-yard run. This was a scratch
race. The medal was a particularly mag
nificent affair; the second medal was as
handsome as the trophies given the win
ners of the other events.
At the crack of the pistol Myers started
off at a long, swinging striae, the others
falling a little behind. It is to be re
gretted that the time was not taken for
each 100 yards of the journey, as it would
be interesting indeed to study tbe details.
I wish I had time to describe the race that
was going on behind Myers between Smith
and Jeshurnn, but will have to reserve the
incident for another time.
At about 600 yards tbe leader was joined
by L. A. Stuart, on* of the fastest short
distance runners of the period, who
coached the champion to the finish in a
remarkably intelligent and successful
manner. The half mile, or 880 yards, was
passed in 1 :55 3-5, the best amateur record
in the world at tbat time, the old record
being l:s6>g. When it is remembered
tbat he had 120 yards more to go it will
readily be seen that Kilpatriek's present
time of 1:53 2-5 is not so very much in
advance, if it is at all, under the circum
stances.
Continuing on the wonderfm runner made
every exertion, and weary but determined
passed the tane in 2:13, which record
stands to this day. No other man has
been able to come within 2 4-5 seconds of
it, an equivalent of about twenty yardsâ
not less. Cumraings, George and Hill
have essayed to accomplish it, but in
vain.
Taking a week's rest, Myers went to
Philadelphia and started against tha
quarter mile record, which in this country
remained 49 1-5. As the season was get
ting a little late and the day windy, and
moreover he did not have the incentive ol
an international contest to spur l im on,
he could only make 49%. However, it was
very fast time, and still remains the top
of the heap in this country as a record
around a curved path. It wil' be remem
bered that, the best on record by Wendell
Baker (47%) was made on a straightaway.
Myers' English record of 48 3-5 stood at
the head of the records until ISB9, and
then it was only beaten the merest frac
tion of a second, or the difference between
48^ and 48 3-5.
In the 440-yard run just referred to
Myers established a 350-yard record that
has never been beaten, namely, 36 4 5 sec
onds. It will thus be seen that he trav
eled the last ninety yards in 11 4-5 seconds.
One week later tne great runner, dissatis
fied with his quarter-mile time, essayed to
lower it on the same a rounds as tbe 1000
yards, the old polo grounds in New YoÂ«-k,
There was a lacrosse match in progress
and Myers came out between the games.

"A whole week!" siehed Anna.
"Worse!" I snapped. "Nine days â
and such a bole!"
"We might go fishing and things with
the kidiets, 1 ' Anna ventured with her 1
head on one side, r ady for a sharp an- i
swer. Anna knew my temper was some- ;
what sawtoothed after 3 o'clock.
"Haven't we fished and done all the j
things ihere are to do, dozens and dozens ;
of times, all summer? I'm tired of the I
children. I want to get out of this hole; '
to climb up and peep over the edge and i
breathe. I'm smothen-d."
"Eâ ow." yawned Anna, the matter-of- j
fact. "Go to bed and dream we borrowed !
Jule's horses to go on a tower." And the !
blackness of the cabin door swallowed
her.
I sat in the moonlight, gazing through
the veil of discontent at tbe "hole." It
rea'.iy was a hole, a deep basin in the
Coast Range, a place of rare beauty in all
seasons. 1 had seen it buried deep in
snow, lying in dignified silence, and it
was beautiful. I had seen it budding in
epring time, every gorge a thundering
waterfall, the oaks waving pinky tufts,
yei.ow violets dotting the spongy hill
sides, the sickly sweet of the wnite lilac
in every breeze, an<i it was beautiful.
I saw it now, beautiiul in the cool night
following a hot day, the forests on the hem
ming hills a dusky, melodious mass, as
the wind-spirits played on Hie pines, the
white tops of the highest peaks sparkling
in answer to the stars, the river ecoldinc in
its black depths at the bowlders in us bed
and iar off a ribbon of silver as the moon
ebone on the stream from the giant where
the nieht shift were at work tearing down
the hillside for a lew golden grams.
I was tbe teacher. Anna was tbe super
intendent's sister. She had been a tower
of strength to me during the last three
months and her presence made bearable
the thought of the three to come. But
this midterm vacation of a week, what
were we to do with it? Nine ong, hot
days, with the glorious Fourth in the
middle.
Jule was an Indian woman who bad
married a white man. The man was dead,
but Jule was very much alive, as were
her seven mixed children, four of whom
were my pupils. 1 was airaid of Jule.
She had a temper which broke easily into
curÂ»es and butcher-knives. Sne had also
seve-ai horses and saddles, which for so
much money she would hire to the horse
and-saddleless.
Anna's words of the ni-ht before
haunted me tbe next day, and finally I
broke out with, "Why can't we co on a
riding tour among the camps in these
mountains?'
â¢â¢On stick horses?" laugbed Anna; "we
can't afford any other kind."
"Ju;e?" I insinuated.
Anna turned to face me with four hair
pins in ber month.
"If you'd a>k," I faltered, "she likes
Jou â maybe she lend v? two, and â "
Anna jabbed the last pin and crushed
me at tbe same instant. "Ask a police
man! You'll wait awhile before I venture
ins de that Indian den. Ask her yourself
if you are so brave."
After awhile, "Will you go with me,
Anna?"
"Go whereT Oh, yes, to Jule's. Ye-es,
111 fo, but you won't dare."
1 did dare. I marched down that trail,
found jule barefooted, weeding her beans,
and, disreuerdu.g all Anna's adviie about
praising ber garden and her children, l
plunged bead first into business and asked
Jule to lend us horses and saddles.
And Jule said yes without a curse, and
offered to send teem np, ready saddled,
by 5 o'clock Monday morning. Maybe I
crowed a little on tbe way home. Anna
took it humbly enough, evidently im
pressed by my diplomacy, though she
called it cheek.
Now we must decide where to go, and
together we planned a journey oi 100
miles in an irregular ellipse, taking in
three mountain towns. Most of the trail
would be new to us, but we had no idea of
getting frightened or lost. The men were
thocked and astonished, and in our scorn
and independence we would not ask about
landmarks or forks in the trail, meaning
to trust to woman's wit and the Provi
dence that cares for thefoohsh. By happy
chance vre found from a passing miner
that the first day's ride would be in sight
of the river until we came to Black Bear
Creek. Ot course wecouJ'in't lose the way.
Basely deserting the old man, who longed
to tell us all about bis latest patent medi
cine, we ran to the cabin to pack onr Sara
togas. Mine was a liltle yel.'ow grip, limp
and travel-stained, and Anna's was a
floursack. We put in them fust what we
bad to have and an extra calico dress.
We went to bed before dart and Btayed
aweke ail night after the manner of those
who wi>h to start early. It made me
think of Josiah Allen's Wife and their
Pleasure Exenion. I will not say whether
we rose at 3 or at 4, but at 6we were
ready, and so waÂ« Jule't< boy with the
horses. The saddles were not side-sadtiies.
We bad diviaed our riding skirts, snewinp
that the menly way was, in thia case, the
common -sense way.
We tie-1 our baggage behind, hung a
bag of lunch from the horn ol my saddle,
mounted, looked at each other and
laughed. It was a regular cquaw outfit.
Anna's brunette face and the wreath of
red poppies on lier cartwheel hat fitted
right into the j ic.ure, but my blonde hair
was incongruous and altogether Dutchy.
My horse was Billy, and Anna ro e
Bessie. Both were common Indian poniea.

nothing but a stout whip. Bessie shse'i

by tbe roadside.

year after year in a solitude broken omy
by quarterly tramps :o the nearrst store.
I confes- to a liking lor them, a wondering,
respecting pitv for men woo are sufficient ',
unto themselves.
When we haa stopped to rest on a moan-
I tain top and tied the horses, we climbed
part war up a hu-e tower of rock. Anna I
stood leaning on a fragment and sane, "I '
Will Lift up Mine Eyes Unto the Hills ,
From Whence Cometh My Hep." I was i
! looking down from a higher point, and I j
â¢aw in the trail an oid man with white
beard and white hair on his shoulders. He
was listening, his eyes fixrd on the sinner.
' I mnved, and he raised hi* hand witu a
i gesture commanding silence. When the
i psalm ended he turned from the trail and
[ disappeared. I wondered what he thought
01 the vision on the unused trail, and I
was glad he beard Anna sing. He will ;
j never hear anything sweeter till he goes I
I where the angels be.
When we came to Black Bear Creek we
! recognized it from the description. "It
looks like coffee with a little ruilk in it."
At 4 o'clock we ras-ed the mountain home
of John Da gett. "Onlv eight miles now,"
I cheered Anna, "and some o them level
! enough to We did gallop reck-
I lessly over the l<-vel, and lost the irail.
; The next mounta.n was covered with ]
| thick brush. Unable to find the traii we i
fought our wav up. Billy kept looking
i around so reproachfully as tu.ts of hair
were torn irom bis sides, and I was so
tired I had to wink hard to keep back tbe
tears.
What happened from the top of that
hiil until we rode into Sawyers Bar is a
blank to me. Anna says we met a man on
a mule and I caimly ;ook my naif of tbe
trail in the middle, almost pushing him
I down the hill. It may be so.
We rested all the day of the Fourth and
saw the town and the people. Sawvers
Bar is a primitive place and unique. Until
the last few years it had no waeon com
munication with the outside world, de
pending on males in summer ami snow
shoes in winter. The elderly Sawyers
I Barbarian does not desre to be a wanderer
I on the lace of tbe earth. There are two
I places, the Bar and "Outside." and decid
j eily to be preferred is the Bar. He is con
servative, too, preferring to have his
daugnter marry one o: the 300 natives
rather than tt foreigner. I tried to unravel
tbe relationship between some of the
j much intermarried families, bat my mathe
matics gave out.
Sawyers Bar is not a bole. It is a crack
amonx mountains. Tbe river flows along
the bottom of the crack, and tne town is
bung on the hillside. Th? bouses are so
buiu into the hill that the clotheslines
back of them are higner than the roofs.
Tne one street is so narrow tbe teams
which come in have to drive through the
town and turn on the outskirts.
On the morning of the 5ta we started on
' tbe second stage of our journey. From
Sawyers Bar to Etna in only 'wentr-h've
miles on a new wagon-road. Tbe last of
the snow had been cleared off only the
week before. At 7 we stopped for break
fast at the Mountain House, a halfway
place of refreshment for man and beast.

, Anna wondered which bead we came

THOSE ENORMOUS COAL BILLS
Under the caption "OuiserÂ« That Can
not Cruise," The Call recently published
a Washington dispatch in which attention i
was directed to the fact that the Bancroft !
and Cincinnati did not bave sufficient
coal capacity to take them across the
Atlantic.
As regard* the Bancroft, that vessel was
never intended for long-distancÂ» cruisinr,
notwithstanding a coal endurance of 5462!
miles at eicht knots was claimei for her i
by the designer. She wae intended !or a j
practice vessel for naval cadets, and her i
range of cruising is limited 'o tbe West j
Indies and up and down tbe American
coast within easy reach of a coai pile.
With the Cincinnati, and her sister ship. â¢
Raleigh, tbe case is sumevnat more disap
pointing, for these two ve-*els of 3213 tons
were intended for cru.sing and cbase,
when necessary, such vessels as they could
cope with.
Tbe inability of our new navy vessels to
keep the sea for long periods without
exbanstin* their coal suj>piy ~as discov
ered shortly after the first vesels were
commissioned, and hai been known to j
the Navy Department .'or at least six
years. In tbe official descriptions of the j
new ships which appeared between 1887 j
and 1891, the lar c coal currying capacity, <
the small consumption and the consequent
extended radius, w^re the special features i
which distinguished our Vessels as com- '
pared with similar types oi otner coun
tries. The Coluinbii, Minneapolis and
New York were especially ponted out as
remarsable in the point of coal endur
ance, but actual practice has shown these !
claims to be little better than puess work, j
It should be said, however, in justice to '
the present chiefs of the Bureau of Con- |
struction and Repair and of Steam En- I
gineer.n-- that neither of them made I
tbe c wild cla ms.
In tbe subjoined tab'.e a list of some of '
the new vessels is given, showing the cal- I
culated coal b'inker capacity in tons and '
tbe actual c-pacity, as derived from
official reports.

A comparison <-f the N w York and t c '
Brooklyn will slÂ»owthat th- Navy Depart- '
ment has profited by previous exaggerated
statements. be New Yfik and Brooklyn
have a displacement of 874'Â» tons arm 10,024 |
tons respect;vt-ly with bunkers filled. The i
Sf>cretaÂ»y of 'be Navy, under date of
December 10, 1892. claimed for the Brook
lyn: "She can eapily go from New York
to San Francisco without recoaling.' The !
present chief constructor, however, does !
not take so sanguine a view of thÂ« ship's
cruising ability, :or he claims an endur- j
ante of only 6033 miles, which, no doubt, '
will come pretty close to the actual per- 'â¢
formance.
With the original coal sunply con
siderably reduced, and the consumption
exceeding in some instances the estimate j
three times, the cruising capacity has thus ;
been greatly reduced. The excels of con- '
sumption is. however, not due to faulty j
engines and boiler designs, for our naval |
muchinery has proved itselt phenomenally
su-cejsful in all particulars. The esti
mate was made not by a practical engin
eer, but by some one wo knew noth n? of
that brand, and accepting the theory
of the evaporating properties of a pound
of coal as correct in practice made these
disappointing predictions of wonderful I
en urance. Then, again, American coal. I
on an average, is inferior to English coal, I
and as a result greater quant. tie- are re- |
quired to obtain result* on superior
fuel. Not all the coal use.i on the ships
is , expended on propulsion, and a larce
percentage goes toward distilling, galley,
heating, electric-lighting, steam-launche**,
wincne.- and pumps. This percentage is !
increasing with the introduction of labor- !
saving machinery on the new vessels. The j
present chief oi the Bureau of Equipment
direc a attenton to the fact that while
auxiliary machinery in 189 -94 used 29 per
cent of the total coal expanded on the
ships the percentage duriu 1894-95 rose to
48 6. ' .
The itemized 4 con! exrenditure* on two
well-known v Â«Â«els will indicate to what
extent coal is used ou Teases of war:
the noble ambition to finish alone, we took
off tt:e heavy saddles and opened the
Stable door. Alas for '.he woman nature
that will face a lion and run from a mouse!
Neither of as would walk pas the white
mule's Leeis, and she was in the first stall.
We waked the superintend n\ turned

as possible from his sleepy sarcasms, and

It will observed that aux liary machin
ery consumed 4,"> rer cent in the Columbia
anil 36 per cent in the San Francisco ot
the to;al coal used. The excess of galley
coal in the latter ship was owing to the
fact ot her carrying an aJn.iral, who also
has a separate range. No doubt during
peace times some of these expensive
auxiliary luxnres could be gnat y re
duced, Jor a biii of $10,300 for one year on
a ship carrying al ont 400 men does seem
a little steep, and $1200 for the galleys on
the San Francisco ith 350 men and one
admiral comes rather high as compared
with hotel expenditures for like pur
pose.
Five years ago auxiliaries did not con
sum â > over 10 per cent of :ae total, but
since then c.cc ric lighting has chielly
helped to raise it to 46 6 per cent.
The coal bills oi the navy sbovv a steady
yearly increas", and with additional ships
and unchecked extravagance may soon
reach $1,000,000.

A LONELY LIFE
Mar\ Jtature, ar\d Skeep
ir\ tke Wilderness
Po*siblv tbe oldest occupation in which
j man is engaged to-day is thai of herding
; *heep. Ii is mentioned in the first books of
I the Bib c. and referred to as an occupation
lof the most wor by kin i. Tbe ticin^a of
j "peace on earth" was first given to the
>hei herds who "wat.-hed their floc*^ at
night," aid omf of the m< st prominent
men of history have put in many years of
| their lives caring for the gentle animals
that are so naefnl to mankind.
The metftods of watching fbeep have
I than ed very little since Biblical times,
I and strange a- ii may *cem many of the
! men at pies> m engaged in it show tne
j "-anie dispositions men of several thou
j gauds of years ago are said to have bad.
There is a tarnation about waicbin*
sheep which appeals to a thinking mind,
which possibly accounts for the fact that
so many r-hilosot'hers of past ages have
been shepherds. The solitude of the hills
is conducive to medication, the changes of
the sty sucgest the Infinite and the sounds
of the nignt come to the loneiy watcher
,as voices of the s.lence. Many men who
are at present in the bils caring ior flocks
vow that tbey can hear the sound of voices
at night when they know there is nobody
within miles.
The California shepherd is an individual
almost entirely unknown to the rest of
the worid. Even the residents of the
State hardy know of his existence, while
the cowboy ha>* a world-wide fame. The
reasur. for t is is not h:;rd to find. It is
because the men p.re different in almost
every way, particularly in disposition. And
after ail ilie difference is to a large extent
causea by ihe animals tbey care ior.
The villainous cowboy who would rather
tiglit than eat and thinks that the nobles:
tnuiij? in the world are forms of dissipa
tion can get no satisfaction for bis nature
in caring for itieh gentle crpaturt-s as
shepp. He wants something that he can
swear at, i:ke a vi> iou- -teer, that would
be only too Rlaii to core him to death if he
wou.d let him. He wants to dash wildly
THE OVERSEER ON HIS LONELY VIGIL.
over the range, on a pony as vicious as the
steer, or himself for that matter, and ride
through small settlements iike a demon.
The beasts in big care are not easily hurt,
and be can abus- them as much as he
feels like, by lnssoinp them, throwing
them down end branding them. There is
nothing gives a cowboy a 9 much pleasure
as branding a bull that has given him
considerable trouble. He likes to see the
creature squirm ia agony as he presses
the hot iron into its flesh. To kill one
that is demoralizing to the herd is the
height of bisdelig it.
In marked contrast to this individual is
the sheepueide â that is, the majority of
shÂ«ei.herders. To be sure there are ;ome
almosi Â«s bad as the cowboys, bnt they are
for the most part men who are employed
by ranchers ior so much v month, and are
deleeat d to tne work as ih*y niipht be to
any o'her xork on tbe ranch. But they
don't like it. Tbe real sheepberder, and
he is largely in tho majority, is the man
who follows it in preference to anything
else. A m^rt who is attached to the work
would rather watch sheep on the hills
than be the president of a bank.
Another class of men who watch sheep
are those who do it tor their health.
Dozen? of men claim to have been cured
o: consumption sirm ly by puitine in .-ev
era! mon ns at watching sheep. The work
friv.-s what i 3 most required in -he deadly
diseaseâ plenty of fresh air, moderate ex
ercise and employment that is not wear
ing on the brain, but is still enough to
keep it occupied ana prevent nÂ«rvouÂ«
ness. Of ci'Urt.e if a man has plenty of
money be can gt tht^e things without
Herding sheep, but ibere are many men
who need them b;<diy who Â»>av- no money,
and all who have a-tn advantage of this
knowledge have surely been benefited. A
| number of men wtio have taken up sheen
| herding have become so fascinated witb it
i that they have stuck to it long after they
I got over the trouble.
Of course, it is not an easy matter to get
j employment of this kind, but if tbe
owner of tbe range knows the applicant
he will be almost sure io give him work,
as he knows he is likely to get good ser
vice. The pay is small, ahon: $2o i month
;>nil provisions, which the man must cook
himself, cxc pt when tbe sheep are close
to tbe ratichhou?e. But ;his does not
happen often. It is no matter whether
the shet- I'herder is an old or a new hand,
the work expected of him will be the same
under any circumstances.
She. p ranges iv California are scattered
all over the Biate, but tbe greater number
of them can be found in ihe foothills of
the Sierras ail the way from Si-kiyoa to
Tehacbapi, and on the otner s de of the
mountains. The work of looking after
tht-m lasts ail y ar, although more must
be don at one tame than another.
In tbe spring of tho year there is not
much for the sheepherder to do, as grass
is plenty after the winter rains and feed
can be found almost anywhere. At thia
ume the flock remains near the ranch
house in the valley an.! only needs occa
sional looking after. But as the summer
advances and iced gets scarce the flock, or
band as it is ca;led in California, must be
driven to the hills.
It is then that the sheepherder's real
wort begins. Tne way it is done in Fresno
County is characteristic of the rest of the
State, out th.- sheepher Jer's life is if any
thing a little more lonely there than eise
wbere.
Along about May the sheep are driven
from the vallny into tbe foothills and the
herder follows them, carrying ad his camp
utensils with him and sleeping on the
ground with only the sky for a roof most
of the time. In some places where there
is known to be feed enough to last several
days cabins of shakes are erected, but as a
general thing tbe hprder seldom sleeps
two nights in the same place.
As tbe flock advances into the moun
tains the herder finds things becoming
more and more lonesome day after day
until the time comes when be is absolutely
alone with the sheep. Not a liv:ng crea
ture to speak to except tbe overseer, who
goes over the range occasionally, or some
other herdex who leaves his charges a lit
tle while to get a few minutes' companion
ship. The sheep are littie trouble and
keep pretty close to the feed line. High
iv the mountains it is so scarce it keeps
them busy to get enough to eat without
doing anything else. All the herder has
to do is to see that they are not stampeded
by a wolf or other wild animal.
The herder usually spends his time rest
ine or preparing las own food. It is when
high in the mountains that Â» man has time
to commune witb nature if he wishes to do
so. Tbe almost barren bills lying under
the clear blue sky and the awful silence
that hangs over the world are all likely
to make a man tbink of things he n -ver
did before. He is really close to nature,
and if be does not hear voices in the night
and even see forms tbrousn the darkness
i his mind U of different material than the
| average.
As the season advances the silence be
comes more intense. The hum of insects
that occasionally broke through the still
ness ceases. The flock is likely to become
more scattered, as food is always getting
scarcer, and the herder is likely to find
himself a mile away from any living
beine. In very dry seasons it often hap
pens that the Sock will go almost up to
the snow line on tbe sides of Mount Whit
ney, searching for bits of crass and moun
tain plants among tbe barren ro< ks that
are burning under the sun tbat comes un
reÂ»isted throueh the rare atmosphere,
and makes tbe world only a blinding
glare. It is this lonesomeness and deso-
lation that keep a certain class ot men out
of the busines-, but it is wonderfully rest
ful to a tired brain and strengthening to a
weakened body.
To jyard tbe end of September it is almost
impossible for the flock to find food, and the
overseer comes alone and says taat it n>
time to drive the sheep to be sheared. PoÂ»
sibly by this time tiie herder has lost
track o: the days of tbe week and the
knowledge of the month of the year is
entirely out of his mind. Of course he
knows the summer is on the w. ne, but
likely does not know whether it is Sep
tember or October. At a'.y rate he is
most 111 1 g:ad that a ehmue has come
and wil Lugly drives tbe flock over the
bare hi!!s to the shearing place in the
valley. This i- slow work as the poor
crea ures are not very strong and water is
sure to bo sea cc.
After turning his charges over to the
Indian shearers the herder can take a
rest for a wbi:e. Some of them go to
town and spend foolishly tbe n.oney they
bave earned, but the majority of them
have other uses for it.
An old Tuiare v'ointy herder named
"Leon" Clark nas worked at the business

One of the most Interesting social events of
the past week was the wedding of Miss Annie
O'Kane, daughter ot Mrs. M. E. O'Kane, and
Dr. Theodore Rethers.
The nuptials were celebrated on Wednesday
morning at half-past 9 at St. Mary's Cathedral
on Van Ness avenue, Rev. Father McQuade
officiating.
The decorations of the church were simple
but most artistic, palms and ferns being used
exclusively. On theaJlar ourucJ innumerable
tapers.
The bride was attended by Miss Nellie
Games, who officiated as maid of honor, and
Miss Gertrude Sutc'.iffe and Monie Fogarty,
who acted as bridesmaids. Frank Dunn v;us
best man and the ushers were: Dr. Lustig,
Percy Long, Frank O'Kane and Horace How
ard. W. D. O'Kane, the bride's brother, gave
her into the keeping ot the groom.
After the church ceremony, an elaborate
breakfast was served by Ludwig at the resi
dence of the bride's mother on O'Farrell street.
covers were laid for seventy-five.
The bride was handsomely attired in a
modish gown of white satin. The jupe was
made en train and the corsage trimmed with
chiffon.
Miss Games, the maid ot honor, wore a
pretty gown, the yoke of which was taanloned
hi yeUow satin and the corsage ot while
organdie.
The bridesmaids were dressed alike in pink
6atin nnd white organdie. AH the young
ladles wore large white Gains-borout;ti lituÂ».
Dr. und Mrs. Ketuers have gout to Dei Monte
for their bridnl tour. On their return they
will reside on the corner of Van Ness avenue
and Vallejo street.
Miss Mamie Kelly and S'ephen A. Gill were
married by the Rev. Katner Ryan nt St.
Brigitl's Church Wednesday evening, Septem
ber 9. Mi-s Kale Maghan acted as bridesmaid
and Eugene Gill, a brother ot the groom, was
best man. The bride ai:d bridesmaid, both
brunettes, were Ure.-sed la white and pre

Mr. Gill is a popular native son and well
knovvn in the business circles of this City.
At the appointed hour the church was well
filled with the numerous friends vi the con

" Ghange your Suit."
A DEVELOPMENT OF THE OLXX FOB TRfMPP, AS
PROPOSED BY MAJOR-GENERAL A. W.
dp.a ysonâ cojicnruM â .
Having considered the advantages of this
system, I will now refer to its probable disad
vantages. I will suppose that my partner has
advanced so iar as to spesk of ihe present con
ventional "signal" <is "ChanEe your suit to
trumps." He sees me play this â¢â¢signal," and
he holds the losing trump, the better trump
being in the adversary's hand. Is my pir I
ner, if a reasonable player, likely to conclude
that I wish him to lead his losing trump, or
will he consider that my signal means
'â¢Change your suit"?
Again, supposing the two remaini-ij; trumps
are held, one by my partner, the other by me,
and 1 ask him to change his suit, is he likeiy
to think I wisn him to draw my trump? or
will he weet-pt my intimation that he is to
change to another 6uit? Mistakes might hap
pen by such means, but I do not think they
are likelyâ at least with an intelligent player,
when the "ask for trumps" has been
altered to "Change your suit" (to trumps).
Thus at the early t-tage of the play of a hand
I suggest that the playing: an unnecessarily
high card means "Chance your suit to
trumps." When, however, the trumps have
all been played, or when ouly oue or two re
main in, and when the play of an unncccessa
rily high card cannot mean 'Scad a trump."
then iheplHyof an unnecessarily nigh card
means "Change yoursua."
I feel convinced that if two players ac
quainted with this system plpyed with equal
cards against two omers unacquainted with
it, there would be a considerable percentage
\ in favor of the former ever the latter.
! This is not the introduction of a new
i conventional signal, But merely increasing
I the powers -if one at present in use, and which
j is now rather cramped and arbitrary in its
meaninie. Whenwhis. payers become accut
i tomed to say, "You asked me to change my
I suit to tru*nps," instead oi saying "You sig
nal, d for trumps" I think the system will be
f.iund practically useful. A player i.ow might
6hv: "You signaled for trumps when (Ley were
i all out. What was I to understand by that?"
I If he said, -'You asktd mo to change my suit
to trumps when they were all out," he would
not be likely to ask what to understand by
that, for trumps bein? out of the question
must be considered out of tht> demand, and
"Chunge your suit" can alor.e be the meaning
of the play of the unnecessarily high card.
When winning trumps Â«re led by your part
ner, the present conventional system of in
timating thut you hold four in the suit, by
playing the lowest but one, followed i >â¢ tne
lowest, would still be folowed without any
1 chance oi confusion. The play of the unneces
sarily high trump wouldâ if we kept to the let
ter of the principle â mean change your suit to
trumps, as the first meaning; as, however,
trumpa were being led, the piay of the un
necessarily high card in trumps could only
mean that the player held four trumps at least.
When a player is leading winning cards and
his partner indicates that he wishes the suit
changed, and when all the trumps are out,
the player would at once use his judgment as
to whether he should continue his suit or
change it. If the player held enough winning
cards in the suit to win the game out of his
own hand of course to change would not be
desirable, so thai a responsibility rests on the
player asking for a change Â«f suit as great as
now rests on the player "asking for trumps."
This responsibility, however, does not
diminish the value of the signal to "change
your suit." when trumps are out.
When a player holds two other euits besides
that which he is leading, and trumps being
out, the signal to change suit may leave him
iv doubt as to which of the other two suits to
lead. A careful aud observant player, how
ever, is not likely to make an error, and his
partner's signal mc&ui "change the suit," as

-her Ames' comments on the play:
This hand is one in which the long suit
system of leading the fourth best gains
| tricks. The short suit or "Hbwell Game"
would lead the 9 of hearts as the "lop oi noth
j ing," and his partner would have no clew to
I unblocking. North would be unable to bring
, in his last three' 'hearts and East and West
would make three diamonds, s
Trick 2â South begins a trump call.
Trick 3â South can count North's hearts and
j unblocks by throwing ihe jncK.
Trick 6 â East's cover is. perhaps question
| able, but it makes no difference. It is, how
i ever, sometimes well 10 cover to promote
i medium cards in partner's hand. Thus, if
West had had another guard to his ten
spades it would be the master card on third
[ round. By his unblocking play South can put
, his partner in in hearls and enable him to
bring in his suit.

LETTERS AND POEMS OF A LONELY
NEW ENGLAND VOHAN WHO
BELIEVED IN "ART
FOR TRUTH"
A recent publisher's nete to the effect that
the large sale of Father Tabb's poems, now in
their fifth edition, was paralleled among
American poets only by the demand for the
posthumous volume of Emily Dickinson, re
calls the work of the singular and gifted New
England woman. There appears to be an in
teresting coincidence in this fact, in view of
Father Tabb's remark, quoted by The Book
man, that "of late American poets there is
none worthy to go down to posterity except
Miss Dickinson . " Her poems appeared several
years ago, four years after their author's deatn.
Her recently published Letters, edited by
Mabel Loomis Todd, reveal in part the strange
personality of the woman who for years and
from her own choice never stepped outside her j
father's house.
Emily Dickinson was born in Amherst,
Mass., in the year 1830. There seems to nave
been nothing exceptional about her girlhood.
Her father was & prosperous man, for years
treasurer of Amherst College, and at one time
a member of Congress. The pictures of her
home show us an attractive colonial house,
spacious and dignified, surrounded by spread
ing eim trees. There were three children-
Austin, Emily and Lavinia. Their mother was
apparently a sensible and practical New Eng
land woman with little time for sentiment.
Emily aa a young girl appears to have had a
hapr>y life. Her education was begun at the
village "academy" and "finished" by & year
at Mount Holyoke. Her letter! at this time
are tne letters of the average schoolgirl and
show no trace of the epigrammatic transcen
dentalism which marks them later. Neither is
there any trace of the shyness which became a
passion in her after life. She seems to have
joined in the social life of her mates and lived
the normal life of the young woman of that
time. Her early friend, Mrs. Ford, to whom
some of her letters are addressed, prefaces
their publication by a short sketch of Emily's
girlhood. According to Mrs. Ford she was one
of a circle of talented young girls, several of
whom became lamous in after years. Fanny
Montague, the art critic, was one, and another
was Helen Fiske, who wrote under the pen
name, "H. H.," and whose death in San Fran
cisco a few years ago was a sad loss to Ameri
can letters. Emily Dickinson, strange to say,
was the wit of the group and furnished the
funny items for the school paper. The only
hint she gave her friend of her future strange
aloofness from her fellows was by asking her
one day if it did not make her shiver to hear
some people talk '-as though they took all the
clothes off their souls." Not until she is about
20 do we fiad symptoms of that later malady â
if malady be the word for her almost fierce se
clusion.
The friend who most helped to form her
girlish aspirations was a teacher in the acad
emy, a Mr. Leonard Humphrey, who was a
few years older than herself. He was a gradu
ate of Amherst and had showed unusual in
tellectual ability and penetration. A letter
to a friend at this time briefly records his
death. His name is only mentioned twice in
the course of her whole correspondence and
once in a letter to her literary godfather, Mr.
Higginson. She says, '"My dying tutor told
me he would like to live till I had been a
poet." This was twelve years after his death 1
We cannot help wondering whether this was
not the key of those minor cadences to which
her life was henceforth set. It seems almost a
sort of sacrilege to try to pierce that reserve
in which she veiled herself. There are souls
as tremulous as sensitive plants. A year
later in a letter to the same friend she de
clines a proffered invitation, saying: "I don't
go from home unless emergency leads me by
the hand, and then I do it obstinately and
draw back if I can."
There is no hint as vet of her writing
poetry. About this time her brother, Austin,
left home and college to take a position in Bos
ton. Her letters to him are delightfully clever,
full of wit, with an undercurrent of sadness
and loneliness, ostensibly because of his being
gone. In these letters we begin to detect the
beat of words, the sense of cadence which
marks her poetry rather than perfect rhyme
or meter. Even in homely sentences one per
ceives the writer to have that "ear for words"
which is somewhat rarer than an ear for mu
sic. However, it need not take a verse-maker
to write in that manner. This fragment from
a letter to her cousin, on the death, in his first
battle, of a friend's son, suggests the poet:
"Poor little widow's boy, riding to-night in
the mad wind, back to the village Durying
ground, where he never dreamed of sleeping.
Ah, the dreamless sleep!"
Her letters to her Drother detail the family
and neighborhood doings, with here and there
a suggestion of her growing dislike of meeting
people. She mentions a great village fete on
the opening of the new railroad. "They all
said it was fine. I 'spose' it was. I sat in Pro
fessor Tyler's woods and saw the train move
off, and then came home for fear somebody
would see me or ask me how I did. Dr. Holland
was here and called to see us." "Dr. Holland"
was J. G. Holland, the well-known author and
later the editor of the Century Magazine. A
visit to the Hollands a short time after this
was one of the few she ever made. Her letters
to them are extremely interesting and show a
constantly increasing brilliancy.
The letters to her young cousins in the begin
ning of the second volume show the womanly
and affectionate side of her nature, that had
no warp in its attitude toward those she loved, j
But by far the most fascinating letters of all j
are those addressed to Thomas Wentworth j
HiggintÂ«on. With her constantly increasing
seclusion the necessity for some expression
seemed to grow. She made no occupation of
writing, but while busy with her house duties
or her sewingâ for she was pre-eminently a
practical, capable New England womanâ she
would jot down the thoughts that came to her
in fragments of verse, writing them often on
the margin of newspapers or the backs of old
envelopes. There was no system or order in
her production and no thought of publication.
Any sort of publicity would have been unbear
able to the woman, whose shrinking from the
eyes of strangers was so great that she re
sorted to all sorts of devices to avoid address
ing her letters in her own hand. Some
times she used newspaper labels, or if
tnese were not to be had, one of
the family performed the office for her.
Her penmanship, of which a fac-simile is given,
seems characteristic of her isolation, each let
ter standing alone. Writing for herself alone
it was not to be expected that her verses
should be finished in form. Indeed it is doubt
ful whether she understood anything of the
theory or technique of poetry. But, as one of
her critics said: "When a thought takes our
breath away, a lesson in grammar 6eemsan lm- i
pertinence." And though her poems may be
fragmentary in form, they are never so in sub
stance. Each contains a distinct thought.
As, for example, this:
Presentiment Is that long shadow on the lawn
Indicative that sunn go down:
The notice to the startled grass
1 hat darkness Is about to pass.
After a time the desire to have some compe
tent authority pass judgment upon her work
grew so strong that it lea her to do what many
with a far less sensitive temperament would
have shrunk from doing. She had come to
have a great admiratiou for the work and the
critical ability of Mr. Higginson, who was
then connected with the Atlantic Monthly,
and she wrote him the following letter, inclos
ing some of her poems :
'â¢Mr. Higginson: Are you too deeply occupied
to say if my verse is alive?
â 'The mind is so near itself that it cannot see
distinctly, and I have none to ask.
"Should you think it breathed and had you
the leisure to tell me, I should feel quick grat
itude.
"If I make the mistake, that you dared to
tell me would give me sincerer honor toward
you.
"I inclose my name, asking you, If you
niease, sir, to tell me what is true?
"I inclose my name, asking you, If you
niease, sir, to tell me what is true?
"That you may not betray me It is needles,
to ask, since honor is its own pawn."
We can i-nagine how startled and interested
Mr. Higginson must have been by the receipt
of such a letter. It might have been written
by an Emerson or a poet of the Concord school
and reminds us that the author was reared in
the same montal atmosphere. Mr. Higginson's
answers have, unfortunately, not been pre
served. It would have been interesting to
read the response he made to this singular
and powerfully ivorded appeal for his criti
cism. We can surmise the gist of his answer
by the second letter from Miss Dickinson. She
thanks him for his kindness and for his "sur
gery." He had evidently pointed out that her
poems were very irregular in form.
"You asked how old I was? I made no
verse but one or two until this winter, sir.
â¢ â¢ â¢ You inquire my books. For poets I
have Keats and Mr. and Mrs. Browning. For
prose Mr. RuskiD, Sir Thomas Browne and the
Revelations. â¢ â¢ â¢"
A small company of friends was that, but an
excellent one. No wonder Ruskin was her in
timate. She was a true disciple of the man
who wrote:
No weight, nor mass, nor beauty of execution
can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought.
Yet I do not believe that Emily Dickinson
was ever consciously defiant of rules. She
rather never considered them at all, and
sought only to express the thought which
grappled her. Sometimes this was done in
strikingly homely phraseology, as in the poem:
Death is a dialogue between
The oplrlt and the dust.
"Dissolve," says Death, the spirit. "Sir,
I have another trust."
Death doubts It, argues from the ground
The Spirit turns away,
Just laying off, for evidence.
An overcoat of clay.
The "overcoat of clay" is stronger and comes
more freshly home to the mind than any of
the usual phrases, such as the body being a"gar
ment to be laid aside," or the like, which have
been said so often that we have mostly lost the
feeling out of them. If Emily Dickinson had
written to-day, she would have found herself
in the full sweep of the art movement, which
contends for originality and freshness of ex
pression, at the sacrifice of every art lorm â
instead of the hackneyed, which is powerless
to really express.
Her letter goes on :
"I went to school, but, In your manner of the
phrase, had no education. When a little girl I
had a friend who taught me immortality; but
venturing too near himself he never returned.
"You ask of my companions. HillF, sir, and
the sundown and a dog large as myself that
my father bought me. They are better than
beings, because they know but do not tell, and
the noise in the pool at noon excels my piano.
"I have a brother ana sister. My mother
does not care for thought, and fatherâ too
busy with his briefs to notice what we do. He
buys me many books, but begs me not to read
them, because he fears they joKele the mind.
They are religious, except me, and address an
eclipse every morning, whom they call their
father. â¢ â¢ â¢
"I have had few pleasures so deep as your
opinion, and if I tried to thank you my tears
would block my tongue.
"My dying tutor told me that he would like to
live till I had been a poet, but death was as
much of a mob as I could master then. And
when, far afterward, a sudden light on
orchards or a new fashion in the wind troubled
my attention I felt a palsy here, the verses just
relieve."
If Emily Dickinson had never written any
verse these letters would have stamped
her a poet. Mr. Howells has said that "if noth
ing else had come out of our life but this
strange poetry we should feel that in the work
of Emily Dickinson America, or New England
rather, nad made a distinctive addition to the
literature of the world, and could not be left
out of any record of it."
In this same letter sne osks Mr. Higginson if
he "has time to be her friend." This was the
beginning ofÂ» a correspondence and of a
friendship which lasted over thirty years, j
until the day of her death, and during all that
time Mr. Higginson only saw her facetwice.
At first he tried to Doint out her imperfections
of rhyme and meters, but he soon ceased,
recognizing here a quality beyond all mere
form. In one letter he must have told her
that her vision was "beyond his knowledge."
or she answers, " You say ' Beyond your
knowledge.' You would not jest with me;
but, preceptor, you cannot mean it?" Mr.
Higginson's interest in the strange genius of
his correspondent led him to visit Amherst.
He has described his call upon Miss Dickinson
in the pages of tne Atlantic. Her shyness and
aloofness were so great that he felt nearer to her
in letters than in conversation. He says that
for.years she never passed beyond her father's
garden, and there were literally years when
her foot never crossed her own doorstep. In
spite of this fact she is said to have been a
gracious and dignified hostess on those occa
sions, once a year, when her father in his offi
cial capacity gave a reception to the faculty
and seniors of Amherst College. Mr. Howells,
however, records that later in her life she
could not even once a year endure -this strain,
and would often sit in a back room, her face
turned from her guests.
Early in life she revolted from the orthodox
creed, but she was none the less dominated by
her austere Puritan ideals. Strongest among
these was an intense craving for sincerity, to
gether with a loathing for cam and social
hypocrisy. In her poem called "Real" she has
expressed this with daring force:
I like a look of agony
Because I know it's true;
Men do not sham convulsion
Nor simulate a thro".

Hamilton Aide reviewed her poems at length
in the Nineteenth Century Magazine. He
lamented their technical imperfections, say
ing they were too often "like pearls in pack

of imagination â her "gift of seeing." That is,
after all, the iundt<mehtnl quality of the poet.
Manner if â or shou.d beâ accessory to that.
She resembles Emily Brant in work and in

AN UNNAMED POEM.
By Kmily Dickinson-
I died for beauty, bu:. was scare*
Adjusted in the tomb.
When one who died fÂ«r truth was Uld
Jn an adjoining room.
He questioned softly why I failed Â»
"For beauty," I replied.
â¢And I for truth, the two are one;
We brethren are," he said.
A nd so. as ktnimen met a night,
We talked between the rooms.
Until the moss had reached our lipg,
And covered up our names.

I SHALL KNOW.
Bt Emily Dickinson.
I shall know why. when time in over,
And 1 have ceased to wonder why:
Christ will explain each separate anguish,
In the fair schoolroom of the nkv.
He will tell me what Peter promised.
And I, for wonder at his woe,
I shall forget the drop of anguish
That scald* me now. ilia, scalds me now.

DAVID STARR JORDAN.
THE BTORY OFTIIIi INNUMERABLE COM
PANY, and Other sketches. By David Starr
Jordan, prestaeni of Ltsnml Stamord Jr Uni
versity, tsai; Francisco: The Whltaker 4 Ray
Company, publishers; clothbound; price $1 25.
The volume before us is made up of separate
sketches, nine In number, historical or aile
gorical, "having in some degree a bond of
union in the idea of the 'higher sacrifice.'"
The substance of most of the sketches has
already been given in lectures by the versatile
head of Stanford University. "The Story of
i the Innumerable Caravan" is an allegorical
review of the religious creeds and beliefs of
the world, in their various pilgrimages, since
the birth of Christianity. The allegory is well
sustained. The journey over the mountains
and through the- forests and across the desert
of life to the distant river, the waters of which
every traveler must breast alone, was made by
One in early times by a way so fair that the
me mory of it became a part of the story of the
land. He left a Chart behind for the puidance
of those who should come after him, but some
who tried to follow him said that the Chart
was not explicit enough, and marked out
every step of the way. Then discord arose, and
new Charts were made, resulting in great con
fusion, until many despised and threw their
Charts away. As time passed on the way grew
brighter, and men saw that most of the diffi
culties and dangers of the way were those
which they unwittingly had made for them
selves or others. The light of wisdom shone
along the way; men held the old Chart more
in reverence than ever before. No longer did
men say, "This path have 1 taken; this way
must thou go."
And someone wrote upon the Chart this single
rule of the forest: "Choose thou thfne own best
way, and help thy neighbor to find that way
which for him Is best." But this was erased at
last; for beneath it they found the older, plainer
words, which One In earlier limns had written
there. "Thy neighbor as thyself."
"The Story of the Passion" is a description
of the famous Miracle Play as it is to-day mod
ernized and perfected at Oberammergau. The
author shows a respect akin to admiration for
the simple, pious peasants In the Bavarian
Alps who endeavor to faithfully and artistic
ally represent the life and acts of Christ. The
sketch contains never a word nor a suggestion
which could possibly invite exception from
the most ardent believer In the divinity of the
holy Kazarene. The play is criticized in a
broad and generous way. Mr. Jordan declares
that only in the sense of historical continuity
can the Passion Play at Oberammergau be
characterized as a relic of medieval times;
that the spirit of the age has penetrated even
to that isolated valley, and that its Passion j
Play is as much a product of our century as
the poetry of Tennyson. The machinery of
superstition is done away with; harmony has
taken the place of crudity, and the Christ of
Oberammergau is the Christ of modern con
ception.
With reierence to such scenes as those ac
companying the crucifixion, the author ob
serves that a treatment less reverent than is
given by those peasants would make intoler
able blasphemy. In hisopinion the perfection
of the 'Passion Play" is its justification.
"It can never become a show," he concludes.
"It can never be carried to other countries.
It can never be given under other circum- j
stances. So loDg as its players are pure in
heart and humble in spirit so long can they
keep their well-earned right to show to the
world the tragedy of the cross."
"The California of the Padre" (an address
delivered at the Teachers' Institute, Monterey,
in 1893) pays a tribute to the early Spanish
missionaries, whose age of glory faded away,
but "leit no stain in the pages of our history."
"The Conquest of Jupiter Pen" tells how,
according to old chronicles, St. Bsrnard,
through the influence of charity and truth,
drove the spirits of evil from the Alps.
"The Last of the Puritans" (an address be
fore the California State Normal School, San
Jose, 1892) honors the memory of the |im
mortal hero, John Brown, "whose body lies
xnoldering in the grave," but "whose soul
goes marching on."
The writings of Ulrich yon Hutten, a con
temporary of Martin Luther in the great re
ligious struggle of four centuries ago, receive
the strongest praise. Hutten, with fiery pen,
fought for freedom of the spirit. This sketch
is entitled "A Knight of the Order of Poets."

A BRIGHT VOLUME
SOAF BUBBLES. By Max Nordaa. New York:
>. Tennyson Neely. publisher. For sale by the
Emporium Book Department; price, 75 cents.
Here is a bright little volume of short stories
by the author of "Degeneration." They make
excellent reading for leisure moments." There
are ten stories in the book. <=Cant and Hum
bug" is a humorous tale of English selfish
ness and American thriftincss. "Wife
vs. Native Land" shows how a wan
may quit smoking for spite, but not
for love. "All Hadji Effendi" relates to the
adventures of a wandering fanatic of Islam.
"The Cross at the Corner" describes the
religions devotion ol a aged Hungarian and
"The Altar Painting" the love-tragedy of an
Italian artist. "A Christmas Eve in Paris"
gives a pathetic incident of suffering in the
Franco-Prussian war during the siege of
Paris. "The Stepmother" is an ingenious dis
cu^ion of that much-abused matron; and
"Pas de Chance" (No Chance) tells the story of
a girl found in a morgue. "How the Fox
hunter Fared in England" has a traeic and
humorous denouement, turning upon the
Briton's mode ol fox hunting; and "Within an
Inch of Eternity" relates how a prison phy
sician's hair turned white in a night from
horror Inflicted on him by two escaped prison
ers. The translator is Mary J. Safford. The
cover is of unique and attractive design and
the large clear type and heavy paper are
additional points in the book's favor.
THE MEANING OF LIFE.
THE PERFECT WHOLE -By Horatio W
Dresser. Boston: George H. Ellis, oubliaher.
For sale by lending book-dealers; 260 pares
cloth; price $1 00. " '
Simplicity of language and distinctness of
thought are characteristics of Mr. Dresser's
writings, and this essay on the conduct and
meaning of life wil! enhance his reputation as
a thinker and as a sincere friend of humanity.
With becoming modesty the author claims no
originality for his essay, but in his thoughtful
appreciation of the wisdom of the ages he has
taken advantage of "the best that has been
thought and said" in the pas*. He has lent
the fresh value of personal experience to em
phasize the problem of problems and has
given a full and frank expression of individual
conviction. The purpose of the book at hand
is threefoldâ psychological, metaphysical and
practical. As a psychological analysis it is es
pecially concerned with the higher or spiritual
nature of man. As a philosophical dis
cussion, It aims to develop a generally sound
view of reality by Â» consideration of material
ism, agnosticism and mysticism "In the light
of their shortcomings when compared with the
demands both of reason and the spiritual
sense." It points out many important distinc
tions essential to a just view of life and indi
cates the dangers of all one-Sided conceptions
of the universe. It is an urgent appeal to life,
a plea for the realization of ethics and the
application of spiritual law in every moment
of existence. Its threefold purpose and its
individual confessions of faith are alike sub
servient to the one central idea for which it
standsâ the unity of all that exists in an ulti
mate spiritual reality. The author declares
that, with true spiritual insight, "the whole
wide universe of beings and things is seen to
be one piece in the great life of God, whose
infinite beauty, love and goodness receive
their full manifestation in that unsearchable
whole whose name is eternity."
A MAN'S SUCCESS IN LIFE.
THE HIGHEK EDUCATION A 8 A TRATN
ING FOR BUSINESS. By Harry Pratt Jud
ton. Philadelphia: Henry Altemus, publisher
price 30 cents. '
The author admits that there are many suc
cessful men who never entered college and
that scholars are often poor business men, and
he maintains that success in business is quite
distinctly not the chief aim in the higher edu
cation. An excellent man of business may bo
a bad citizen, a bad father and an unhappy
man. One may succeed in business and yet
even in his own judgment make a failure of
life; and it is possible to fail in business and
yet make life a glorious success. Business is a

means to an end, and that end is a p. od all
around life. To succeed in business and to
succeed in life are two things that should be
conjoined, and as modern life is very complex
success is no small thing and implies no small
knowledge.
"The dreamer is out of date," exclaims Mr,
Judson. "Men must be thinking and doing
with nervous energy. Their minds are wide
awake. The pace is set by steam now and not
by oxen. People are no longer provincial.
Tne whole world belongs to everybody."
"One who would fill any considerable place
in^the world must understand the world is
more than a fragmentary waif, and that un
derstanding implies a wide and varied train
ing."
Tne successful business man must have four
prime qualifications â industry, intelligence,
acuteness and reliability.
"The well-trained college man," declares
the author, "knows how to work patiently and
hard; how to wrestle with new questions; how
to keep at a thing until he masters it, and this
is the very essence of the habit of business.
The higher education gives just the training
in industry which a business life demands."
The essay is worthy of the consideration of
parents who can afford to give their boys a
higher education, and who are nevertheless
undecided as to the advisability of doing so.
"If a boy is of the right sort," says Mr. Judson,
"he will at college form habits of methodical
industry quite as well as in the factory. He
will learn a larger intelligence than can be
given by mere business experience. His mind
will be trained to ready command of all its
fatalities. If, again, he is the right sort of boy
he will learn a high sense of honor. Beyond
all this, he vill become adapted for social life
in all its forms; he will De at home anywhere,
and he will have his ideas so broadened and
his tastes so cultivated that he will know how
to make the most of life wherever he is. He
will be a larger part of the community."
LITERARY NOTES.
George Kennsn has written three short
stories for the coming volume of St. Nicholas.
One is called "How the Bad News Came to
Siberin," and describes how Mr. Kennan and
his comrades, while at wort on the Russian
Overland Telegraph, received news of the com
pletion of the Atlantic cable. This, of course,
ruined and brought to a sudden stop the en
terprise in which they were engaged. Another
story, called -'My Narrowest Escape," is an ac
count of an exciting adventure in Russia. The
first of the stories will appear in the Novem
ber St. Nicholas.
Among D. Appleton & Co.'s September publi
cations will be, "What Is Electricity?" by Pro-
I fessor John Trowbridge of Harvard University,
a new volume in the International Scientific
Series; "Alterations in Personality," by Al

J. Mark Baldwin; "Fiat Money in France"
(new edition), by Andrew D. White; "Tne

"A Court Intrigue," Dy Basil Thompson, and
'The Idol-Maker," by Adeline Sergeant.
It is proposed to erect in Paris a monument
of Paul Verlaine. A bust by Niederhausen is
to be placed in the Luxembourg Gardens,
near the statue of Henri Murger. The money
is to be raised by international subscription.
Stephane Mallarme is president of the com
mittee and the Chap Book has been appointed

Mr. Hope will furnish a sequel to "The

can and of timely interest and importance,
such as "The Government of Greater New

"The New York Working-gin," "The Sculpture
of Olin Warner," "Tne American Lighthouse
System, " etc.
E. L. Godkin, editor of the New York Even
ing Post, in an article on "The Expenditure of
Rich Men" in the October Scribner's, says that
rich Americans, by building great houses for
a display of their wealth, excite envy, hatred
and malice, and he advises them to avoid
this by expending it in erecting great public
monuments, such as picture-galleries, mu
seums, arches, statuary, etc., which will per
petuate their names and rid them completely
of the imputation of selfishness.

AMERICAN WOMEN
GERTRUDE ATHERTON TELLS
WHY THEY FASCINATE
ENGLISHMEN
Gertrude Atherton In the London Daily News.
The fascination of Englishmen for
American women has been much discussed
of late, but the time is approaching when
the possession of England by American
women will prove a subject of far more
vital controversy. In fact, it threatens to
become one of the great international
questions, for it means the reconstruction
of two races. I understand that an effort
| is being made by the United States Gov-
I ernment to prevent its voting citizens
remaining abroad more than two years at
a time, that it is seriously alarmed at the
increasing thousands of Americans who
are settling in Europe. The United States
press has also half awakened to the fact
that the defection of its women means a
loss of something more than millions, al
though as yet its only suggestions in re
self-protection have been to impose a tax
on the dots of American heiresses marry
ing foreigners, and to create a domestic
peerage.
Meanwhile, what is the reason that at
the present moment American women
practically own Londonâ that they set the
fashions â have, not to exaggerate, five ad
mirers to every English woman's one, and
the pick of the best men? A great many
obvious reasons have been advanced.
They are prettier, cleverer, more vivacious,
more natural, dress better â which is to
the eye what music is to the soul â have a
born and acute understanding of men, less
religion, above all more money.
These reasons are all good, but a little
analysis will show that they do not hold
water. Spanish and Austrian women are
more beautiful than Americans. The
French woman is equally clever and viva
cious, dresses as well, and what she does
not know about men is not worth record
ing. With the Catholic races, at least, re
ligion is an airy convention, not calculated
to make man wish that all women were
pagans, and there are heiresses all over
the world.
The one manifest Doint, therefore, upon
which the American woman is sui generis
is her naturalnees, her habit of thinking
out loud, her lack of self-consciousness,
of mannerism. All English women talk
as if they had studied elocution. An
American voice, even when trainante, has
the effect of spontaneity. And sÂ© with
the manner, the habit of thought, the
quick, fresh way of looking at life.
But this quality, delightful as it is, is
hardly strong enough to constitute more j
than a passing charm, and the American '
woman's foothold in England is growing
firm as the years go by. She has come to
stay, and what is more no Englishman
seems to be terrified by his brother's
choice.
Under the obvious reason, or rather set
of reasons, there must then be a funda
mental and psychological reason. English
men rarely marry European women, with
all their manifold charms. They make
love in Paris, Vienna, Seville, Venice and
Yokohama, but the foreigner they marry
is the American. It must be, therefore,

that they recognize in American women
something that they most want â some
thing that the women of their own coun
try cannot give them.
Can it be that while Englishmen hava
gone forward, have become more alive
every year, have kept pace with their cen
tury â it may almost be said that they
have set the paceâ the English woman has
stood still? In many instances has she
not degenerated ? Take her literature.
With some very few exceptions, no Eng
lish woman to-day is writing either intel
lectual or wholesome fiction. Leaving the
silly novelists out of the question, what does
the enormous success of the neurotic, mor
bid and decadent effusions denote? One
need hardly think twice to answer that it
means a general degeneracy among Eng
lish women. 1 hear several thousand
people remarking, "These same books
have had great sales in America." So they
have, but because the United States is in
tellectually under the yoke of England,
and is as yet too heterogeneous to have sj
mind of its own on the subject of liter
ature. None of these books would hava
achieved success if written in Americaâ
in fact, they could not have been written
in America. As it is, they are read out of
curiosity, tossed aside and forgotten.
To return : It is inconceivable that the
women wbo read and exist in these novels
as the expression of their inner selves do
not bore and disgust men. Englishmen,
taking them generally, are the most
wholesome, healthy-minded men in the
world. They live a clean, outdoor life,
love sport better than women and make
history along the natural lines of evolu
tion. In them is no taint of morbidity,
and it is easy to imagine how little attrac
tion the quality has for them in woman
kind.
Do the "advanced women" and their
following actually believe that they can
reconstruct these men â the most domi
nant, perfectly balanced, rapidly develop
ing and highly developed race of men the
world has ever known â along lines laid
down Dy themselves? As well try to
harness the sun. The end will be that
their men will let them severely alone and,
marry American women. In the feminine
literature of to-day and in its success is
the note of decay; one can small the
mold.
It ?eems to me that this is the secret of
the- affinity between American women and
English men. The vast majority of Amer
ican men are composed of two elements
pnlyâ money greed and sensuality. They
are at the very beginnings of their own
development, the most elemental race
of men in all civilization to-day. Ameri
can women have so far flashed past them
that they stand on the plane which Eng
lish women would occupy if they had
kept pace with their men. They are alive
to their finger tips; they have cast off the
yoke of conventionality, cut-and-dried re
ligion, and all the old forms and tradi
tions which should be and must become
obsolete as the higher civilization.

rOR PBESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLET, Of Ohio
FOR VICF-PREBIDEXTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of Hew Jersey
ELKCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
Political anxiety is about over.
The campaign is simply a march to
prosperity.
Ail who wish good business and good
wages are working for "McKinley.
When the conductor shouts "All aboard
for Canton" everybody in sight takes the
train.
Weather prophets will soon change the
subject from politics to tell you about the
coming winter.
"What the people need is confidence,"
soya McKinley, and the people respond,
"We have it in you, Major."
International bimetallism means busi
ness, while silver monometallism means
panic, and the people know it.
The workingmen of the country have
learned that on McKinley's lawn they are
nut warned to keep off tne gras3.
In the mouth of the average Democratic
ofiice-seeker free silver talk is simply a
dodge to evade the tariff question.
By persistently reiterating his speech
Bryan may make it familiar to the coun
try, but be can never make it a household
word.
Genuine bimetallists are those whose
sense is on the side of free silver as dis
tinguished from the cranks who are crazy
on it.
Democrats and Populists talk of only
one plank in the Chicago platform and
look amazed when reminded that there are
others.
There are many parties in this country,
but only one of them is united in har
mony, and that is the party of protection
and prosperity.
The silence of the free-trader is a good
pign that hereafter protection will be the
permanent policy of the country, and that
means prosperity.
Demoralized Democracy has ceased to
hope for harmony in its own ranks and is
now seeking consolation by trying to find
a kicker or two in the Republican party.
"Wandering Wiilio" is not a dignified
title for a candidate for the Presidency,
but what can you call a man whose name
is Willie, and who keeps wandering
around?
This campaign will settle the economic
po.'icy of the Nation and put an end to
industrial disturbance, so that we can go
forward, not only to better times, but to
new issues.
Th* cottage home of McKinley has be
come the popular resort of the American
people, and no one ever goes there witn
/ out finding a welcome and hearing words
of good cheer.
From the silence of the big spell-binders
câ tong the Democrats and the Populists
it would seem the campaign has reached a
point of higher education where they can
not keep up with it.
The campaign has now progressed far
enougn for the end to be clearly seen, and
Â«b a consequence business men are no
longer afraid of further Democratic ex
periments and once moro gold is coming
into the country instead of going out.
In a moment of unaccustomed good
sense Bryan advised all the voters of Rich
mond who were opposed to him to vote for
McKiuley, and this is perhaps the only
counsel he has given in the campaign
that the people will be willing to follow.
The promise of prosperity to be derived
from the free coinage of silver on the
Bryan plan is only a mf rage arising from
the unknown, but the promise of pros
perity to be derived from protection is an
assurance of things well known from the
experience of all.
McKinley has long stood in the front
rank of our statesmen, and his speeches in
this campaign have placed him in the
fiont fank of our orators. No other
speaker in this canvass has given utter
ance to so much political wisdom em
bodied in epigramatic phrases as he has j
done, or has expressed so much clear
common-sense with terseness and elo
quence.
The list of weekly periodicals of this
City is to be increased by a new one, the
Graphic, which is to be published every
Saturday and will be devoted to politics,
literature, society and the drama. The
initial number is _ very attractive one,
both in contents and in typography, and
is handsomely illustrated. Politically the
new weekly is opposed to the free coinage
of silver, and will prove a valuable addi
tion to the supporters of the cause of
Bound money.
TRICKS AND TRADES.
The plan of fusion arranged by the
office-seeking managers of the Democratic
aud Populist parties has now been suffi
ciently developed to be fairly well under
stood. It is not certain how far the Demo
ojurtic bosses have gone in encouraging
Mr. Cator to believe they regard him as
the logical fusion candidate for the Senate,
but it is certain that the whole plan of fu
sion consists in bartering one office for an
other. This is being done in the name of
Bryan, but not for his profit. The spoils,
if there be any, are to be local spoils and
will be divided among the traders who
have made the fusion.
Democrats who believe In the political
philosophy of Jefferson that "Govern
ments govern too much," and that the
powers of the Federal Governuient should
be confined to a strict construction of the
constitution, how do you like this trade
which promises to deliver your votes to
office-seekers of that Populist party which
would carry governmental paternalism to
an extent never yet practiced among civil
ized men? How do you like to be called
on to vote for members of the Legislature
who have bargained to elect to the United
States Senate a man who favors fiat
money, Government ownership of rail
roads, the referendum, popular initiative
and the imperative mandate? Huw do
you like to aid in raising to official power
a man whose political policy would tear
down the last vestiee of State rights and
locel self-government and vest in the Fed
eral authority a power as unlimited as
that of the Emperor of China? How do
you like a trade that subordinates all your
Doiitical principles to a creed the mere
statement of which would have made An
drew Jackson gasp and swear?
Populists who have faith in the wisdom
of your party policy and who for years
have worked and fought to build up a
party to support that policy, how do you
like to trade ail 3'our principles and all
your work to that Bourbon Democracy
which has mocked at you for the sake of
getting in return an office for some Popu
list who is not so devoted to his principles
as you are? How do you like to cast your
vote for some Democrat whose politics
you detest In order to induce soms other
Democrat to vote for a Populist whose
principles he detests? How do yon like
this bartering and trading, this dickering
and dealing with your vote without your
consent? How can you engage in a com
bination which is to count your creed and
your conscience for nothing and entice
your ballot from you by a bunko game
that will not only wrong you, but deprive
your party of its political prestige?
There can be but one answer to these
questions. Tricks and trades among the
lower class of office-seeking politicians are
common, but they never succeed when the
people are aware of them. As a Nation
we delight in straight politics. "We honor
the man who stands for his convictions
and votes for them on election day regard
less of office. In all parts of the United
.States there Is a feeling of admiration for
the Republican of Texas who stands by
his platform, though he never cets an
office, and for the Democrat of Vermont
who goes to the polls year after year to
meet a certain defeat. These men are re
spected even by those who believe them
to be politically wrong, but for the trick
sters and traders for office no one has re
spect. Party fusion is an abomination to
the American people. Office-seekers may
plan it, but the voters will scorn it, and
the ballots on election day will show how
futile have been the attempts of the bosses
to trade the votes of honest Democrats and
of honest Populists.
We are now convinced, after three years of
experience, whatever may have been our polit
ical relations in thepast, of the truth of the ob
servation of Webster, made more than half a
century ago. You will recall that he said:
"That is the truest American policy which
shall most usefully employ American capital
and American labor and best sustain the
whole American population." â McKinley.
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND
STRONG.
Nearly 100,000 people from Ohio and ad
joining States formally opened the cam
paign â a campaign for protection and
honest money and, consequently, for pros
perity â at Canton on Friday last. No
such a gathering was ever before seen at
an interior town in this country. It was a
political but not a partisan demonstra
tion, for there were delegations of Demo
crats as well as delegations of Republi
cans. The purpose of all was the same,
however, and all were of one voice in pro
claiming that the time had come when
the honor and integrity of the Nation
needed to be protected against the appli
cation of theories of government which
contradict and antagonize the experience
of nations and commerce and peoples the
civilized world over.
It cannot be said that it was merely
junketing parties meeting at a common
center for amusement, for 100,000 men
would not quit their business and go
junketing in times like tnese; besides, if
they did, they would not rendezvous at a
place so small that it could not entertain 25
per cent of them, nor would they etand in
the hot sun to listen to political speeches.
The fact is, the whole â¢country is being
awakened to the danger to State, com
merce and social life that lurks in the
foids of _ryanism. It is not so much,
either, that there is any real fear that Â£ry
anism will prevail as it is indignation on
the part of the wealth-makers of the coun
try at the presumption of the Bryans,
Altgeldsand Tillmans in trying to revolu
tionize commerce and society. Neverthe
less the sentiment in every avenue of the
country's business life is that an ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure, and
the pilgrimages to Canton mean that the
ounce of prevention is being got ready.
In any event, Bryan's theories of gov
ernment would make business men and
wage-earners apprehensive of danger; but
Bryan himself intensifies the dread of
having them matte the policy of the Gov
ernment by saying that "we would no
doubt have a panic at first after the adop
tion of free coinage." Commerce nor
those who work for a living are quite
ready to plunge the business affuirs of the
country into a panic merely to try an ill
advised monetary experiment, the more
so because the experience of trade, in
dustry and labor pronounce Mr. Hryan s
theories wrong in principle. There is in
tho6e pilgrimages to Canton, therefore, a
reflection of public sentiment â a senti
ment, indeed, that permeates the entire I
commercial and industrial community.
In this connection the fact should be
made Known that it is not in Bryan's
monetary vagaries where all the danger
lies. The law-abiding citizen fears that
Bryan's purpose to practically overthrow
the Federal courts means a Government
without any well-defined method of ad
ministering law. His advocacy of the re
peal of the civil service law and a return
to the spoils of office system is alarming
not a few. and his determination to sub
ject every one to an income tax, with the
accompanying spy system, makes people
shudder. So, it will be seen, there are very
many reasons why there should be political
but non-partisan gatherings at Canton
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1 890.
every day. The people want peace and
prosperity, .not confusion and uncer
tainty. _^____________
Prosperity in manufacturing v inseparable
from prosperity in agriculture. Set all the
wheels in motion, set all the spindles whirl
ing, set all the men at work on full time, start
all the idle workshops in the country, bring
back confidence to business, and the farmer
will at once feel the influence in the greater
demand for his products, in the better prices
he would receive. â McKinley.
WILL BE TENDERLY CARED. FOR.
Of one thing the Irish political prisoners
who were recently released from British
prisons may be assured. Tuey will be
made as comfortable as the condition of
their health will allow. Irish- Americans
have taken the matter in hand, and they
are not the kind of people to be satisfied
with any half-way measures; and there is
true Irish chivalry in insisting that con
tributions for the relief of the ex-prisoners
should come exclusively from their own
race. There are plenty of Americans, who
have no Irish blood in their veins, who
would be glad to contribute, but all the
more glorious is it to Irishmen to prefer to
make it a family affair, so to speak, and
themselves extend the tender care that
these terribly abused men may need.
Whether English prison rules are un
necessarily harsh or not, the fact remains
that these Irishmen who have just been
released were and are still gentlemen of
culture and refinement and used to good
and kind treatment, and that they were
entitled to consideration on that account,
being merely political prieoners, but they
were subjected to conditions that were ex
acting beyond all reason, and England
may be sure that history will note the
facts without fear or favor.
It will not do for the British authorities
to plead in extenuation of their hars_
treatment of these men that the rules of
their prisons are applied to all alike, and
that they cannot be made to yield to ac
commodate any one, for right at this mo
ment Dr. Jameson's imprisonment is made
little else than setting narrower bounds to
his going and coming. He is treated with
great consideration, and his friends have
access to him. Indeed, be la treated more
as if he was a guest of the prison's offi
cials than aa a law-breaker, and yet his
offense was greater than was charged
against the Irish prisoners.
But these liberated Irish gentlemen are
broken in health anil cannot engage in
business pursuits, for axhile at least, nor
can all that British prison harshness in
flicted upon them be removed or undone,
and surely they are entitled to the kind
consideration of every one who loves right
and justice. However, they will not
suffer for anything that money will buy,
for they are in the hands of their own,
and their own are great of soul, warm of
heart and true to duty.
The day of silver is coming. It is my seri
ous and solevm opinion that the full recogni
tion of silver will come soon; that it will come
through the efforts and under the direction of
the Republican party, in which the conserva
tive people of this country have confidence,
and that it will nevet come through the Dem
ocratic-Populist aggregation headed by this
wandering orator of the Platte. â Senator Wot-
001 ' â â â___. ______
THE WRONG OF SECTIONALISM.
Geographical discrimination by political
parties in their effort to secure supremacy
is the most threatening of the dangers to
oar institutions. It has become the cus
tom for parties to ignore sections where
there is no encouragement for success and
throw the weight of their influence to in
crease majorities where they are already
sure oi winning. Naturally that sort of
tt'ing creates a sectional feeling, but as yet
all feeling of that kind has quickly passed
away immediately after election. Never
theless, it is playing with fire, and it
might grow to be a disastrous conflagra
tion.
it wonld be far better if parties would
throw speakers into sections which they
knew were wedded to the other side. It
would leave no room for suspicion that
geographical discrimination was intended ;
besides, if a party believes its theories of
government are best suited to all interests,
it should want to preach its doctrine in
every community. There is no section of
this country that is not more or less de
pendent upon every other sectiou, nor
could injury be inflicted upon one commu
nity and all other communities escape
hurtful influences.
No greater blunder was ever made by a
public man than Bryan made when he
referred to the Eastern States as the
"enemy's country." There is no soot in
the United States that is at enmity with
another spot, and it is wronging the spirit
of our system of government to even in
timate that there could be. There are
interests that are widely different, but
there is interdependence between all in
terests, and every one is necessary to every
other one if the Government means a gov
ernment for all the people without dis
crimination.
It is wrong, it is unpatriotic, to misrep
resent the personnel, the material advan
tages or the integrity of one community
that advantage may accrue to another,
and yet it is done in every Presidential
campaign. We lose sight of the fact that
it is the people who elect public officials; ,
that the people who elected Harrison sub
sequently elected Cleveland; that the peo
ple who elected Cleveland rebuked hi 3 ad
ministration two years later, and that it is
for the most part these same people who
will elect a President next November.
The people are responsible for the con
duct of the affairs of the State and Nation,
except when officials fail to obey the peo
ple's instructions, and hence all the more
is the danger to our institutions when an
aspirant for political preferment attempts
to stir up geographical hatred so as to
solidify the vote of his own section. There
should be no "enemy's country" in all
this broad land, nor is there such a spot.
Trade, commerce and the people are free
to go and come, and when they are con
fronted by "enemies" anywhere they may
safely conclude that the glory of the Re
public has departed forever, and that sec
tional discrimination and hatred rule the
land.
As sure at ths night follows the day the
Avierican people â awed at first by the novelty
and force with which the Populists urged
their demands â will detect the absurdity and
hollowncss of the silver movement in time
utterly to rout its advocates. Bryan's progress
is on a more majestic scale than Coxey't,
but it is essentially the same and is to the full
as ridiculous and dangerous. â Louisville
Courier- Journal.
TERSE SENTENCES.
No one has failed to observe that Major
McKinley's speeches to visiting delega
tions abound in terse sentences, and that
very many of them cover the whole field
of economics.
To a delegation of waee-earners he said :
"We do not propose to vote in favor of a
money the value of which we have got to
ascertain every morning by consulting
the market columns in the newspapers."
To another delegation he asserted that
"if there is one thing which should be
free from speculation and fluctuation it is
the money of a country. It ought never
to be the subject of mere partisan conten
tion."
To a mixed crowd ot farmers and labor
ers be Baid that "no one suffers so much
from cheap money as the farmers and la
borers. Taey are tbe first to feel its bad
effects, and the last to recover from them.
This has been the uniform experience of
all countries, and here as elsewhere."
A delegation of business men were told
that "we cannot restore the public confi
dence by an act which would revoiution
ieo all values, or an act which entails a de
ficiency in the public revenues. We can
not inspire confidence by advocating re
pudiation or practicing dishonesty."
In answer to a quastion put by a visitor
concerning free coinage of silver he said:
"Free silver would not mean that silver
dollars were to be freely bad without cost
or labor. It would mean the free use of
the mints of the United States for the few
who are owners of silver bullion, but would
make silver coin no freer to the many who
are engaged in other enterprises. * â¢ â¦
Mexico and China have tried tbe experi
ment. Mexico has free coinage of silver
and (told at a ratio slightly in excess of
sixteen and a half ounces of silver to one
ounce of gold, and while her mints are
freely open to both metals at that ratio
not a single dollar in gold bullion is coined
and circulated as money."
A workingman asked what was needed,
if not free Â«ilver coinage, to revive busi
ness. The reply was: "It is not an in
crease in the volume of money which is
the need of the time, but an increase in
the volume of business : not an increase of
coin, but an increase of confidence; not
more coinage, but a more active use of the
money coined; not open mints for the un
iimited coinage of the sfiver of the world,
but open mills for the full and unrestricted
labor of American workingmen."
When some one asked about the classes
being against the masses he promptly
replied: "Every attempt to sway class
against class, 'the classes against tbe
masses,' section against section, labor
against capital, the poor against the rich,
or interest against interest, in the United
States, is in the highest degree reprehen
sible. It is opposed to the National in
euiict and interest, and should be resisted
by every citizen. We are not a Nation of
classes, but of sturdy, free, independent
and honorable people, despising the dema
gogue, and never capitulating to dis
honor."

SENAIOR SHORTRIDGE.
Gilroy Gazette, September 17.
Those who have been here leveral years will
remember well one of the finest speeches de
livered dnring the campaign of '88 as that of
Samuel Shortridge. We learn that this gentle
man will speak in Gilroy during the present
campaign on the issues of the day. Mr. Short
ridge will, if the Republicans win, more than
likely be one.of the Senators from this State.
Oi his ability to perform the high duties of
such an office there can be no question, and as
to eloquent advocacy of measures for the cood
of our State and whole country, there would
be no voice in the Senate chamber more po
tent. Mr. Shortridge is a good silver man, bnt
thinks that for the raited States to adopt free
coinage without aid of any foreign nation
would be disastrous to the cause of bimetal
lism. In this the Gazette differs from Mr.
Shortridge, bnt in that only. On all other
points in politics our views coincide with his.
At any rate, if Mr. Shortridge comes nere to
speak, as we are assured he will, there will be
an intellectual treat lor our citizens.

Wditor San Francisco Callâ Sik: Permit me to
say In a preliminary remark that letters are
beginning to pour in on me inquiring why I
am not writing for The Call, as usual, and
I dosire to say to my Populist friends that it is
wholly my fault. I have had so much com
mittee work to do besides attendtng to the
new duties I havo undertaken as an editorial
writer on the new PoDullst journal about to be

to be prompt hereafter.
Much has been said in Republican newspa
pers and by RepuDlican orators since General
Harrison made his great speech in New York
City, August 27, in Carnegie Hall, opening the
campaign in the East, as to' the dangerous and
revolutionary attitude of Mr. Bryan toward
the Supreme Court of the United States, and
as a p.ain Populist it seems to me that the
danger to American liberty and the constitu
tion of onr country lies iv the opposite direc
tion entirely. On that occasion General Har
r,ison said :
"The Supreme Conrt, the: most dignified
judicial t>ody In " the world, was ap
pointed to interpret the laws and the
constitution, and when that court pro
nounces a decree as to the power of
Congress, or as to any other constitutional
question, there is but one right method if we
disagree" â to amend the constitution. The
question at issue, the reader will remember, is
whether the Supreme Court had a right to de
clare the income tax unconstitutional; in
other words, whether the Supreme Court is a
co-ordinate branch of the Government, or the
supreme authority over all.
We have Harrison's view, and now let us
read what Lincoln said in his first inaugural
address on the limitation of the authority of
the Supreme Cou.t: "I do not forget the posi
tion assumed by some that constitutional
questions are to be decided by the Supreme
Court, nor do I deny that such decision must
bo binding to the partirs to the suit. â¢ * â¢
If the policy of "the Government upon the
vital questions affecting the whole people is to
be irrevocably fixed by the decisions of the Su
preme Court the moment they are made, as in
ordinary cases between parties in personal
actions, the people will have ceased to be their
cwn roasters, having to that extent resigned
their Government into the hands of that emi
nent tribunal.' '
Which is right, Lincoln or Harrison ? If
Harrison and the McKinley Republicans are
right then Lincoln is dangerously and radi
cally wrong. I hold with Lincoln, and I can
distinctly remember that the same charge was
made against the early Republicans and abo
litionists becau-e of tneir attitude of avowed
antagonism to the dtcislon of the Su
preme Court in the famous Drod Scott
case, which was to the effect that "the
ncKro has no righu which the white man
is bound to respect." Of course that decision
was warmly defended by the slave power
which ruled the Nation and the Supreme
Court then just as the money power does now.
The same charges were made by the slave
power against Lincoln because he denounced
the Dred Scott decision as the money power
now makes against Bryan because he de
nounces the income tax decision. Lincoln was
then just as revolutionary as Bryan is now.
The Supreme Court was held just as infallible
by the slave power then as it is now by the
money power and Harrison.
The slave power then had its orators, its
newspapers and its Harrisons, who *ald of
Lincoln and the Republican party just what
Harrison said the other night in New York of
Bryan and the People's party. In solemn tones
they said, as Harrison says now: "You are to
answer then, my fellow-citizens, in all the
gravity of a great crisis whether you will sus
tain a party that proposes to destroy the bal
ance which our fathers instituted In our form
of government, and whenever a tumultuous
Congress docs not agree with the Supremo
Court and a subservient President," etc. Dear
me! dear me! Think of a "tumultuous Con
gress" of Populists and Bryan Democrats and
Silver Republicans, wich Bryan as "a subser
vient President" and weep fo"r your country.
Lincoln says that "if the policy of the Gov
ernment is to be fixed by the Supreme Court,"
in a word if Congress :s subjeot to the Supreme
Court, "the people will have ceased to be their
own masters," and this court will bjcome
their master in so far as they consent to the
subordination of their Congress, the law-mak
ing department of the Government, to this
non-elective, life-tenure, autocratic "Supreme"
Cuuru Harrison says that "'when that court
pronounces a decree as to the cowers of
congress or as to any othÂ«r constitutional
question," why that "decree" is to stand till
it can be changed by a constitutional amend
ment. Lincoln says that if the people allow
this court to fix the limit to those powers of
Congress they have ceased to bo their own
masters, etc., thereby implying Iv plain terms
that they, the people, must resist these en
croachments on their liberties or tlicy consent
to the mastery ol the Supreme Court.
But listen once more to General Harrison:
"I oannot exaggerate the gravity and the Im
portance and the danger of the assault upon
our constitutional lorm of Government,"
meaning thai if riryaa is elected these corpo
ratiou-lawyer Judges (with which the court
has been packed in recent years, a fact so no
torious as to be a public disgrace) will have
their infallibility annulled by the appoint
ment of additional judges who will not try to
subordinate Confess and will sustain the
rights of the pcodlc in their integrity. What
an assaultâ on the corporations and the usur
pations of that infallible courtl Think of a
"decree" of thai infallible court being reversed
in a few weeks in the income-tax case by a
'right-about-face' of one Judire, who thus saved
the millionaires about $50,000,000.
General Harrison then referred to an "Eag
lish friend's" criticism, but did it occur to
him to refer to the fact that an act oi Parlia
meut stands a_ law, and no "supreme" court
or tribunnl of any kind ever undertook to set it
aside, except one"â the people, when they repeal
it? The acts of Congress should stand lust the
same in the United states till a "decree" of
the people annuls them. That is not the prov
ince of the Supreme Court.

SUFFRAGE SHOULD BE RESTRICTED
RATHER THAN EXTENDED.
Fortunately for the fate of our democratic
institutions, the disbelief in universal suffrage,
which is so often brought forward as an argu
ment against woman suffrage, is not general.
As has been said over and over, we have never
had real universal suffrage, and until that has
been tried and found wanting there is no use
in talkint? about going back to an oligarchical,
not to say monarchical, form of government.
In the words of William Lloyd Garrison Jr.,
such an objection to woman suffrage "is im
pertinent aud irrelevant, not touching the
issue at all." Granting for argument's sake
that the suffrage should be restricted, the re
striction should apply to men and women
alike, and not act by shutting out an entire
class of citizens, irrespective of intelligence
and fitness for the fr-nclnse.
Such objectors seem to be fearful that a
large iu_ux ot women Voters would add
greatly to the illiterate vote. One would think
that illiterate women existed in hordes, far
outbalancing the educated women; but when
one tries to follow up this alleged amount of
illiteracy among women, and to find out where
it is located, the search proves to be strangely
elusive ; these ignorant ones always belong to
some other fellow's circle of acquaintance.
l'.ut is not the danger from illiteracy, and its
extent, greatly exaggerated?
According to the ia s t census there are, in
round numbers, 10,000,000 women in the
United States who have received an education
from being able to read and write to the high
est education obtainable, and 2,000,000 who
cannot read and write. Again, tne proportion
of illiterate men Is about tue same as of illit
erate women. Balance the male and female
illiterate vote with the total vote of the women
of the country and there will remain the
handsome number or 6,000,000 educated
votes to reinforce those of educated men.
la our own State women who cannot read
aud write the English language will not be
enfranchised, since an educational qualifica
tion to that extent Is now a part of onr state
constitution. We should expect to find the
greatest illiteracy among foreign immigrants,
but even were there 110 educational qualifica
tion the danger some fear on the tcore of the
illiterate foreign female population does not
cut much of a figure in our State. According
to the census 01 1890 there are 234,117 native
born women 20 years of age and over out of a
toial white female population amounting to
485,280, and 101,592 foreign-born women of
the same ace, and all of the latter are by no
means uneducated.
It is a generally known fact that more girls
than boys attend the higher schools of our
public system, and that the girl stays longer
at school than the boy; and as far as knowl
edge of the questions of political science is
concerned, Mrs. Ida A. Harper expresses what
will hardly be questioned in saving: "Without
any preparation it will be admitted that
women are as capable of casting an intelligent
ballot as the boys of 21 and the mass of newly
naturalized citizen*."
What really happens wherever woman suf
frage is gained is that the best and most rep
resentative women exhibit the greatest activ
ity in the formation of study clubs or civic
clubs, to prepare them for their duties as citi
zens. In thin connection Mrs. Helen Ecob says
of the Colorado women : "Realizing their igno
rance of civic duties, as soon as the right of
euffrnge was secured they began a careful
work 01 education. It is said tnat during tne
eight months after suffrage was granted more
books on political economy were sold than
during eight years previous. Lectures on
economics were giveu by the best speakers
who could be secured. The drawing-rooms of
representative women were transformed Into
lyceums for the discussion of civic duties.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The study ot economics led to much
questioning of husbands and brothers at home,
and the disclosures compelled both men and
women to demand _ thorough renovation."
What is true of California la true every
where when women are treated as responsible
citizens. With such proof of capacity for self
improvement and such zeal, when a direct
interest in the Government is given women,
why longer sing the old song, "Women do
not know enough to Vote"? Besides, as George
W. Cable save, "Men are disposed to exagger
ate the difficulties of voting intelligently
when they talk of women voting. By the time
a public question is ready for the popular vote
it has become a very simple question that re
quires little more than honesty and common
sense to vote unon it."
We believe the possession and exercise of
suffrage an education in itself, and that this
Government cannot avoid decadence unless
all oi its citizens become educated up to its
needs through active participation in the elec
tion of the officers intrusted with its adminis
tration and have a lively interest in the prob
lems tnat confront it. We do not expect the
millennium Immediately, as dome of our op
ponents say of us, but we do believe that hope
for ultimate improvement in the condition of
things can only dawn when the thought and
experience of both men and women can be
nuited in a practical way. Our country has
progressed to the point where in every other
sphere men and women confer and act to
gether to their mutual benefit, and there is no
logical reason why progress along these lines
should stop Ht the threshold of political life.
Takiug up the subject as to whether univer
sal suffrage i 9 the best for our form of govern
ment, 1 will quote trom the younger Garrison,
who expresses clearly the prinerples upon
which the Republic was founded. Every one
must decide for himself whether the fathers
were wise or not in their generation. The
underlying principle of our greirt experiment
of self-government is that 'governments de
rive their just powers from the consent of the
governed,' which includes the humblest
member of society. Not from the consent of
the rich, of the educated, of the strongest, but
of the governed. It was a momentous ex
periment, based upon an abiding faith In
Human nature, a conviction that the average
wisdom oi all is safer than that of a portion,
however favored. It took into consideration
poverty and ignorance, trusting to the innate
desires of humanity for order and good gov
ernment. It was assumed that, although the
principle might be severely tested, as en
lightenment increased, fostered by popu
lar education, government would improve
and the responsibilities of the ballot have an
elevating effect. â¢ â¢ â¢ Nor can the virtue
and intelligence of the country afford not to
have the unintelligent and poor send their
representatives to speak lor them. They are
the warning dial that indicates to all eyes the
magnitude of the degradation in our midst.
We cannot nfford to overlook or forget It. In
asmuch as the dial's hand shows its Increase
so much more has the alarm to be sounded
and regenerating influences set to work to
rescue society, which otherwise lulled in a
fancied security might awaken too late. Upon
the walls of our representative Government
let the whole Nation's figure be thrown and
the shadows be as prominent as the lights.
Republicanism can only bear the trial, bnt
cannot spure it. We are too far on the voyage
to put back. The ship has incurred its chief
dangers, because too many of its crew arc
kept under the hatches. Let them up into the
day. Welcome womau to the rights and
responuibilities of an untrammeled ballot.

DISCRIMINATION TALKED OF.
Said to Be a Scheme of the Pacific
Bell Company to Shut Off
Competition.
A move that looks like an attempt by the
Pacific Bell Telephone Company to shut
out competition vras made last evening by
Attorney Levinsty, acting presumably in
behalf of George C. Gould. An application
for a writ of prohibition restraining the
Board of Supervisors from opening bids
for the purchase of the telephone franchise
applied for by the People's Mutual Tele
phone Company was tiled in the County
Clerk's office.
The reasons given wby the Supervisors
should not be allowed to accept or open
the bids are two. The first is a technical
oneâ namely, that the notice of the sale of
the franchise was not published, as re
quired by law, every day for ten days. The
Becond reason advanced alleges that the
provisions of the order of sale are such
that all bidders are excluded from com
peting for the franchise except the Mutual
Telephone Company and the Pacific Bell
Telephone Company.
The portion of the order in which the
joker is said to be concealed is that which
provides that the franchise may not cc
sold to any company unable to produce
within ten days of the date of purchase
the bona tide contracts of 2000 subscriber?. !
There has been a great wrangle for j
months past in the board on this tele
phone franchise matter. Attorney Her
man de Laguna has several times ap
peared before the Supervisors, represent
ing a company of capitalists whose
identity ha 3 never been disclosed. Gen- I
eral Friedricbs has also used his best i
efforts in behalf of some client or clients j
whose names have never been made pub
lic. General Friedrichs offered among
other inducements to allow the City forty
free telephones snould hi 9 company get
the privilege. Attorney de Laguna raised
the offer to 100 free phones, which raise
the general subsequently saw.
There was also a great deal of trouble
over the question as to the lowest bid that
â would be accepted. Some one wanted the_
minimum limit fixed at $1000, but Super '
visor Spreckels raised that considerably
by offering personally to give $10,000 for
the franchise.
The whole matter finally culminated in
an order in accordance with the wishes of
the People's Mutuaj Company being pub
lished, and it is to the issuance of a fran
chise under that order that Levinsky and
his client object.
Bids were to have been opened to-mor
row at 3 F. v.. but in all probability the
writ of prohibition will be issued before
.hat time.

Danger in the Newiy Introduced
White Mailcars Upon the Streets
of the City.
For nearly a week Uncle Sam has been
running fenderless cars through the
streets of San Francisco. True they are
used for the single purpose of mail transit,
but this in no wise lessens the possibility
of death to men, women and children who
by chance or otherwise get in the way of
these modern vehicles of torture â as op
erated in this City.
The question has been asked time and
again where the liability would fall should

Over the Rails.
a mailcar kill or severely injure some one.
The Government, through Superintend
ent Flint, promptly throws the responsi
bility on the railroad, while the latter
would seemingly like very much to shilt
the whole thing to the broad shoulders of
Uncle Sam.
In the first case it is pointed out that the
Government is not held responsible for
any casualties which occur on regular
railroads, meaning such lines as do a gen
eral freight and passenger business. They
simply pay so much for services performed
and that ends it. It Is contended, there
fore, that the new street mail service comes
under the same rule. The Market-street
Railway Compan> r receives a certain sti
pend for services performed, and the Gov
ernment, or rather it is so contended, has
nothing to do with deaths; broken limbs
or other casualties.
From the schedule published by the
railway mail service and now performed
by the Market-street Railway Company a
eervice considerably in excess of the
"eignt-miles-an-hour" law is inaugurated.
For instance, the distance from Station D,
at the foot of Market street, to Station C,
Twenty-second and Mission streets, is 4.93
miles, yet the round trip, 8.96 miles, in
cluding four stops, is made in one hoar
and thirty-six minutes.
On the broad-gauge cable lines the same
proportionate schedule is in operation,
the trip from stations D to H and return
being made in exactly 1 hour and 4
minutes. On the Sacramento or narrow
gauge cable lines the time is much faster.
One round trip to Station D, a distance of
9.82 miles, is covered in 1 hour and 13
minutes.
"These cars should certainly have fen

ders," said Superintendent Flint yester
aay, "though the department cannot in
any way be held responsible for uccidents
which might occur by reason of this negli
gence. The MarKet-street Company is just
like any other common carrier doing busi
ness with the Government. They get ?o
much for services performed, and there
onr responsibility rest;. The company
furnishes the car, the power and the oper
ators, and can alone be held liable for
casualties."

I. M. Scott's success in obtaining the i
contract to build Uncle Sam's defender

work for the hands employed about the

means prosperous times for everybody

Irving M. Scott thinks that the swift tor

Will probably take all of three years to

been so great that more than 6000 copies had
been given away by the Charter Association

they secured from 50 to 100 copies, which
they promised to distribute with advantage
among members of the organizations repre
sented by them. Ten copies have been sent to
each of the organizations in San Francisco

Mills building will be given as many as de
sired. A copy will be cheerfully sent without

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1896.
IS A WOMAN MINER.
Arrival of Mrs. Mary King, Who
Has Made a Fortune in
Kern County.
The L;dy a SkilUd Assayer and
Knows Mining in All Its
Details.
Mrs. Mary King, owner and manager of
the noted Talc gold mines at Kings Camp,
forty miles northeast of Bakerstield, is at
the Russ. Mrs. King is a practical assayer
and has the active superintenuency of these
mines. The properties are paying hand
somely.
The lady learned mining thoroughly
from her husband, George W. King. He
taught her all about making practical
tests of the different kinds of ores, running
the engines, mill and otber machinery
and timbering the mine. Tnere is noth
ing appertaining to that kind of gold min
ing of which she has not a good scientific
knowledge.
Since her Husband's death several
months ago she has had the sole super
vision of the property, and her ability is
shown by the fact that she is reaping rich
dividends every month.
"I would not exchange mining for any
other business that I know of, because it
is so independent and so profitable, pro
vided one understands it," said the lady
to a Call representative yesterday. "There
is no reason why a woman cannot carry
on the work of mining and mate money
the same as a man. A woman can acquire
the knowledge as readily as anybody else.
"One beauty about mining is that you
pet your money about as honestly as ft is
possible to get. It is unlike business,
where you have to use ail kinds of schemes
to make sales, and perhaps take advan
tage of customers. You get out your
balls of amalgam from the mill, and "any
time you want money you can taice your
gold and get it. Mining is so independent
that I count it the best of all things in
wnich anybody can engage.
"During tlie years that my husband and
I lived at the mine he taught me assaying,
how to follow tbe veins and run all tne
machinery. To-day I can make fire or
other tests of the ore as good as anybody.
I can make horn tests, and if the amal
gamator is away I can do as I did for sev
eral days awhile ago when he waa sick. \
take his place. I know oy the sound of j
the machinery if everything is running
right, even when I am at borne iv my
house above the mine.
"The reason why these are called the
Talc mines is because just inside the gran
ite walls of the quartz, and next to "it on
each side, is ffiayer of talc about a foot
thick. This talc is as rich in gold as the
quartz is. Both run on the average a
little over $22 in cold to the ton. The
quartz vein is from twelve inches to two
and a half feet in thickness. It has been
opened for a distance of 750 feet. There
are in all four tunnels, one above the
otber, and all on the vein.
"There are sixteen claims in all in the
Talc property. The machinery is located
on the Saginaw claim. I had a man ex
amine the upper workings a few days ago,
and he estimated that there were iroru
18,000 to 10,000 tons of this ave:aÂ«e rich
ore in sight. There is a great deal more
ore besides what is in the upr er part. I
may say there are thousands of tons.
"Dr. Hatch of the State Insane Asylum
owns an interest in the mine, but he leaves
everything to me, and says that whatever
I do that in my judgment is best for the
mine is all right. We are working a lorce
of eleven men now, and are running a six
foot Huntineton crusher, which handles
about twenty tons of ore a tiay.
"I have no reason to complain of the
showing we ate making in any way. In
fact lam delighted with it. I have got all
the money that I shall want. It is a clean,
dry mine. It is ho clean that I can go
down there any day with a white dress and
slippers and not gel it soiled in the least.
Yes, mining is certainly a very nice busi
ness. I wonder why more people don't go
iv to it.
"A woman as well as a man, who really
understands mining, can go out and
locate a mine and make it pay. There la
nothing about it that is not based on good
sense. It is simply a case of mystery giv
ing way to a knowledge of the work in
hand."
Mrs. King is here for a few days on
matters pertaining to the mine. She is a
lady naturally disinclined to talk for pub
lication, but it was explained to her that
lier success would interest thousands of
people with whom the achievements of a
woman in mining is a novelty.
Surplus of John Itrowng.
A case of peculiar interest has just come to
light In the local pension office, though the
wrong, if any, has been going on for nearly
ten years. It seems that in I^B7 John Brown
oi Stockton made application for a pension.
Before the case could be acted upon he left for
Southern California and is now residing, so it
is said, hi Fresno. In time Brown's applica
tion was approved and returned to the address
given, Stockton. The papers were delivered to
another John Brown, who until 1894 drew
the money due the original applicant. The
Stockton Brown died iv the early part of 1895
and his wife immediately asked for an in
crease. In the meantime the first Brown had
been heard Irom and hence tne request of the
supposed widow for an increase created some
confusion at Washington. The matter has
been referred to the local pension agent, who
is endeavoring to fiud out if a fraud has been
committed.
Young, but Very "Tough."
Nick Bontine, alias Murphy, a youthful and
diminutive criminal, appeared belore Police
Judge Campbell on a charge of grand larceny
and wai held for trial in #2500 bonds yester
day. Nicfc Is only 12 years of ago, but accord
ing to tfr^pollce he is thoroughly depraved.
A short time ago "stood up" a messenger
boy on Broadway and robbed him of 13 cents.
Under the law a Police Judge cannot send
boys to the Whittier Reform School, except by
branding them as telons, and Nick is such a
dangerous character that Jndee Campbell de
cided that Whittier Is where the boy belongs.

It is worth while being a strong man, because not one in

THE MUSCLES
SHOULD BE
MORE SENSITIVE
Did you ever try to push a kitten over
the edge of a step? The question has a
suggestion of cruelty, but kittens have a
way of getting under foot, and the cat is a
frequent victim to the popular belief that
she has nine lives- But if in a moment of
haste and irritation you ever did give a
kitten a thrust from the edge of stair,
chair or table you doubtless remember how
determinedly it resisted the impulse that
obeyed would have precipitated it floor
ward. With all Its not inconsiderable
might, with bracing of paws and clutch
ing ciaws, the timid speck of a kitten,
whose eyes are open, will resist whatever
its instinct warns it is likely to produce
pain. You do not have to guard the
small creature from harm as, for instance,
you must guard the baby. If by chance it
does get a tall can you imagine any young
cat in possession of its senses rolling from
top to bottom of a stair as a young or fre
quently an adult human being seems to
think he must simply because he has
fallen over the first step?
I read recently with considerable amuse
ment an account of how would-be actors
are taught to fall. It was curiously sug
gestive of the faulty training we give these
bodies of ours, that we should for a mo
ment consider it an art for any man who
knows he is going to fall at a certain in
stant to go down in such a way as not to
sustain any injury. Not only should we
be able to do this, but had we such pos
session of our faculties as should be the
inheritance of every human being we
might easily prevent ourselves from fall
ing at unexpected times, or when we fall
unexpectedly might unconsciously gather
ourselves as quickly as a cat does and, like
her, fall upon our feet.
The young cat shrinks back from the
brink over which the young child calmly
rolls to serious injury, not really because
it has an instinct which the child does not
possess, which warns it of possible barm,
but because it possesses in addition a
muscular consciousness descended to it
turough countless generations or ances
tors who have developed this couecioui*
ness through use.
The cat is not alone in possessing it.
You cannot pass your hand before the
eyes of a blind horse without causing the
creature to wince; not because he sees
your hand, which may be a foot away
from his face, but because his sensitive
muscles warn him of its presence. All
< reatureÃ, even very young ones, have the
ability of self-protection to a greater de
gree than the human being, but there is
no reason in the nature of things why
t ais should be so. If mothers, instead of
hovering over thtir children, forbidding
them every sort of amusement that seems
to possess an element of danger and ren- j
dering them helpless by unnecessary care
and attendance, devoted a little intelligent
effort to teaching them to recognize and I
avoid danger, we should have fewer in
eliiciems and fewer accidents than we now
hear of.
As it is most of us never learn what our
bodies are capable of. We are content to
accept the theory that we have five senses;
to give these a fair degree of development
and to consider that thus we have fulfilled
the demands of "the modern fad for phys
ical culture." But we shall never do
enough until we have become as deft as
cats in the handling of our bodies.
Children should be given exercise which
does more than develop the muscles.
These can really grow at the expense of
the nerves that supply them, while their
real muscular consciousness or sensitive
ness remains undeveloped. We are still a
long way behind the Japanese in athletic
training, and we shall remain behind
them until we learn that deftness and
efficiency are as desirable as mere strength.
Of what avail is it that a man can strike
a sledge-hammer blow when awake if an
enemy can catch him sleeping? The human
SOME NEW AND BECOMING BICYCLE COSTUMES THAT ARE POPULAR
Under the first head comes the San Bouci costume, which can readily be appre
ciated even by those wi-o wear bloomers, as it is a jaunty habit of the newest cut.
Ihe cloth is a slate- K ray tweed, the collar being of white boxclotb. The girdle neck
'"^"k, li ? ln ? Â° f thG Zo Â° aYe J acketareof back satin; the white gloves are stitched
with black, the shirt bosom is speckled with it and a ribbon of black aatin encircles
the very becoming cap.
I know the criticisms made concerning such skirts, but a woman who is a perfect
mistress of the wheel not long ago declared that there was no danger to be appre
hended from lon X skirts except from beginners. However, I know that the "divided
skirt," or as it is called the "new bicycling skirt," is regarded with greater approval
by many. The stylish one illustrated buttons down the center of the front the back
when riding, being unbuttoned, so as to fall on either side of the wheel. When wait
ing the skirt looks like any ordinary one. The gown is of fawn cloth and the coat is
lined with white satin; the large white collar is of cloth, striped with fawn.
The hat of Panama straw has a full bow of a blue shot taffeta ribbon at the left
side. The result is excellent, but numerous are those who do not feel *afe even when
thus attired; so an ingenious English woman evolved the loose-fitting knicker
bocker costume. This has been patented. By means of strings the knickerbockers
can be quickly converted into skirts. The model given is of an nn usually light weight
greenish cheviot, lined with a rich dark crimson surah. The pleated Norfolk jacket is
at once seen to be the worn of a good tailor, so excellently well does it tit, the pleats
setting perfectly. The belt worn is an unusually handsome one of green alligator
skin, the buckle being of dull gold. The gaitera are of a fine black cloth. As yet I
being who boasts that he has strong nerves
because he is not airaid of ghosts and can
suffer or see suffering- without flinching
may betray himseif, unconsciously, by his
involuntary start at a sharp unexpected
noise or the quiet approach of another
person.
We know how acute becomes the con
sciousness of those who live much with
nature; but civilization is rapidly lower
ing the physical standard of man and all
our boasted physical culture is not suffi
cient to counteract its enervating in
fluences.
I spoke in my last paper of the benefit
to be derived from so simple an exercise
as making the tips of the thumbs meet
accurately above the head. There are
other "trifles light as air" that are equally
useful and as easily practiced. If you
wish to Know how little real muscular
consciousness there is in the tips of your
fingers, despite the exquisite nervous en
dowment of these organs, here is a test
for it:
Close your eyes and resting your elbows
upon the table before you endeavor to
make the tips of your two forefingers meet.
After several attempts you will bump them
together, but it will take considerable
practice before you will be able to touch
tip to tip lightly, delicately, quickly'and
accurately. You will not be able to main
tain your first effort very long, not be
cause of muscular fatigue, but because of
the strain upon your closed eyes.
These organs are almost the most hope
lessly overworked servants in the body.
So accustomed are they to doing the work
of all the other members that even the
closing of the lids is not always taken by
them as a signal to go off duty, and quite
unconsciously on your part the eyes
strain and tire themselves in the vain ef
fort to see the whereabouts of each finger
and telegraph it to the br,ain, that the
latter may guide the wandering tips to
the trysting place. This, because, with a
nervous endowment superior to that of
any other creature, we suffered our sense
of touch to deteriorate until we uncon
sciously rely upon sight for the aid it
should give us.
Psychologists tell us that muscular ac
tivity is, after all, mental activity. This
is undoubtedly true, but even the most
active brain cannot move promptly
through irresponsive muscies, and hitherto
the tendency of most of our physical cul
ture has been to make the muscles re
sponsive to but one demand of the brain
that calling upon them to put forth
strength. What we need now is training
that shall make our muscles sensitive as
well as strong. The right hand has been
too long ignorant of what the left hand is
doing, while at the same time the two
have been too long dependent upon direc
tion from the same centers. The two act
together unconsciously, yet lack the keen
perception by which they unerringly meet
in the dark. The samÂ« lack of real co
ordination exists between hands and feet.
If you do not believe it try so simple an
exercise as a conscious direction of the in
teraction of the legs and arms in walking.
"You will find, for instance, that if you
swing yourarms at all the right one conies
forward at the same time as does the left
foot. Now. try walking steadily and light
ly, bringing your right arm forward simul
taneously with your right foot. It will
take you some little time to learn how.
Probably you will lose your balance, or
even get a fall before you accomplish the
new trick. It is worlh while to persevere,
however, if only for the satisfaction of
knowing where your arms and legs really
are, and that they are there in response to
intelligent direction from the brain. There
is another benefit in the action, in that it
brings into play muscles not generally
used and thereby increases the body's
power and usefulness.
Man differs from the lower animals in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 1896.
that he must learn through experience
what they know by instinct. The child
learns, in time, what the kitten knows in
stinctively, that to crawl over the edge of
the top stair is to fall, but few of us learn,
as we go through life, what the kitten ac
quires almost as soon as it can run. the
art of catching ourselves, balancing our
selves and assisting a fall in such manner
as to fall upon our feet. When, by some
lucky chance we do fall thus, we are
almost certain to come down flat-footed,
the most of our weieht upon our heels,
with the kind of concussion some one has
graphically described as driving the
spinal cord through the brain." Most
women jump this way and never seem to
learn the art of coming down upon the
toes, bending the knees and recovering
the balance with a little upward spring.
The exercises that promote muscular
sensitiveness are of so gentle an order that
the athletic girl is apt to smile at hearing
them called exercise. They are of value,
however, even in the matter of increasing
strength. In this class belong many of
the exercises in the Swedish system of
physical culture, movements directed
toward the gentle, systematic, progres
sive awakening or each muscle in the
body, bringing all to harmonious growth,
rather than a te^r, or even a majority to
excessive development. This last, it can
not be too often said, is the tendency, and
a mischievous one, of nearly all modern
athletic fads. Whoever takes up some
athletic pastime rides it as a hobby,
wheeling, rowing, riding, playing golf or
tennis, until there is a specialization of
the muscular development, withâ be it
carefully noted â a corresponding special
ization of brain development, for if mus
cular activity is really brain activity, then
it follows that the particular portions of
the brain that control oft-repeated special
muscular acts develop equally with the
muscles they control, and at the expense
of other less exercised areas. Carefully
considered, this view of the matter must
materially alter the ordinary conception of
"a sound mind in a sound body."
The physical culture of the future, to
be really worthy of being called physical
Skirts That Reach the Ankle, the Divided Skirt,
Patented Knickerbockers and Bloomers
Bicycle Costumes the Skirt That Reaches the Ankles, the Divided Skirt, Patented,
Knickerbockers and Bloomers
have not had the pleasure of investigating such a costume so must leave to your
imagination how the cords are arranged, and how tne skirt ia cat, what its width, etc.
I can only add that there are many admirers of the knickerbocker skirt in this coun
try. The sailor hat worn is of blacfc straw, two green quills being stuck through the
black ribbon band. 6
It is true that bloomers are regarded with great prejudice by many charming
women; and I confess that in spite of the fact that they are certainly the safest tosrs
to wear on a bicycle, I cannot bear to see women wearing them-well, say, in the
park. In the seclusion of the country they are not so bad. and of course 'there are
bloomers and bloomers; for instance, the least objectionable I have ever seen were cut
full and were composed of a dark blue serge. Ti !6 coat was beyond all criticism and
lined with dark green taffeta. The shirtwaist, the tie. ths gaiters, the hat and gloves
comd not have Deen improved upon. At first in Paris knickerbockers and bloomers
made a strong bid for popular favor, and many were the jokes and cartoons circulated
culture, will aim at producing in the hu
man being the same sensitiveness that
warns the lower animals of danger and
makes their muscles alert and prompt
to act. By all rights instruction in the
noble art of self-defense should include
development of the special senses of sight,
taste, smell and touch as well as of the
muscles that enable one to strike from the
shoulder, for as civilization advances it is
presumable that dangers will come oftener
along these lines than by direct violence.
Penelope Powelson.
THE FASHION IN FURS
Already we have been given an idea or
two concerning what are to be the fash
ions in furs. Caracule will probably be
worn considerably. It is being made up
into longer and fuller capes than last
winter, as both Caracule and mink capes
are being made so full that they fall in
regular fluteÂ«, and Borne of last year's
styles are lengthened by adding a gathered
flouncing of fur to the hem. The result is
said to be good, but I rather doubt it.
Some sealskins are being treated in a
simiiar manner.
FASHIONS
FOR
GENTLEMEN
The predictions that men wou.'d shortly
be seen attired in waistcoats and
ties of a rainbow-like brilliancy will not be
verified this winter; instead, even the
fawn-colored waistcoat is passe, the white
having taken its place for afternoon dress,
and brown shoes are not to be worn ex
cepting for country wear or for mufti.
Rough goods are among the most stylish
which have thus far reached New York,
and for lounge suits cheviots will be much
worn by smart men.
Covert coats are preferred in drab. They
are to be made loose, and only a good
tailor can cut the new coats with any
measure of success.
"Him" in his last article gives some val
uable information, as he is well qualified
to do. Concerning the frock coat he writes:
The frock coat will have three buttons and
will extend exactly to the knees. My tailor
furnishes me these data, which I should say
can be taken as an absolute criterion: "The
skirts are moderately long, say about forty
inches, and the natural waistâ whatever that
may meanâ is 17 and the fashion waist 18)^.
(I feel now as If I was calling out numbers in
his fitting room). Vicuna with a twill pattern
or perfectly smooth is the material. The
lapels are faced with silk. They are not built
up as formerly, and the shoulders are devoid
of padding. Men are expected to wear their
frock coats unbuttoned. Angola will be one
of the popular cloths for trousers. Gray
striped cashmere, however, is always consid
ered neat, conservative and smart The
promised checks have not matured." This
latter sentence has a financial ring about it,
albeit disinnl, which is quite refreshing.
Trousers will continue to be cut about 19
knee and 17^2 bottom.
It is very English now to call your dinner
coat a dress jacket, and our British cousins are
falling in line and are wearing that very use
ful garment at many minor functions. It
comes back to them after a season of being
transplanted, a popular hybrid which will al
ways have a place In their wardrobe. The
dress jacket has the roll collar and its siik fac
ings are brought to the very edge of the lapel.
I believe evening waistcoats will be without
collars.
Pajamas in pongee silk are very satisfac
tory, especialiy when the white is used, as
it is well known ping and blue silks are
more fashionable, but they soon have a
faded appearance. C. C.
r i diculine the English women, who from the first frowned upon such masculine irar
ments. Now the strictest English spinster is not more particular about bavin? h*

who prides herself on always being correctly attired. However many predict that ir
is only a question of time and we will cease to see anything out of the wÂ»v i,.

consider them the most truly modest and correct attire, and l hU gh to scorn th* .tit
which, they declare, constantly catches in the wheel. In conclusion, let me commend
to your attention a description of a costume which lately appeared in Vogue as for

THE COSTUME
OF ONE
OCTOBER BRIDE
A lovely blonde created quite a little
flatter not many days ago, so beautiful
was she in a pale blue and white foulard
frock. The bodice of plain light blue
surah was covered with white mousseline
de soie with lace flowers let in transpar
ently. The perfectly cut skirt had in
numerable tiny tucks from' the waist to
the hips, while the waist wan trimmed
with five cordings set closely together in a
Vandyke pattern. Encircling the rounded
waist was a silver belt richly adorned with
turquoises, a slender string of which were
worn also around her throat.
An October's oride will leave home in
one of the most stylish tailor-made dresses
I have seen for a long time. It is of a
very handsome green smooth-faced ladies'
cloth. The little basque is short and cut
so as to show a smart bit of a V-shaped
vest of white cloth, braided with tiny
black and green silk braid. The short
cape, worn of the same material, is beauti
fully cut and lined with a novel black silk,
covered with green leaves exactly match
ing the green in the costume. The hat
which will De worn with it is an entirely
new shape felt, an exceptionally fine one,
which is trimmed with a studied sim
plicity.
This same bride has for one of her din
ner dresses quite a lovely crepe de chine
of a light pearl gray, that is to say the
skirt is of the crepe, around the bottom of
which are five very narrow rows of apple
green mousseiine de soie rnchings ; the
bodice is of apple-green mousseline desoie
over silk of tne same shade. A mere band
ruche of the mousseline is the only sleeve.
A wide sash of the crepe has two deep '
ruches on each end. Of course, it per
fectly matches the mousseline, and the
shade of gray is exactly tne right one to
combine with apple-green and vastly be
coming.
From Paris has just arrived a simple and
effective confection for an extremely styl
ish matron. The gown is made of a ma
terial which has a tobacco-brown back
ground, over which are small, raised, ir
regular lines of black, green, red and blue.
The plain, five-yard-wide ekirt is lined
with a beautiful quality of surah, which
changes from green to red and from red
to blue. The Eton-cut jacket reveals a vest
of white suede, most charmingly embroid
ered in brown, green, red and blue silks, a
veritable work of art. The sleeves are of
the old coat shape and have curious tri
angular-shaped little cuffs of the embroid
ered suede.
Many authorities declare that flounced
skirts will shortly be universally worn in
the evening, and it is reported that we are
to return to the old style by separate foun
dations, and these will induce the frilled
appearance round the hem which we are
about to be compelled to cultivate after
the style of our grandmothers. In this
case a separate silk foundation and a tight
bodice lining, also of silk, could be used
for half a dozen gowns, and should such
economy be necessary I should advise
them to have a good quality of white glace
taffeta, which can pay many visits to the
cleaners with satisfactory results.
Tulle is to be so generally used this win
ter that a description of a Newport pown
:om posed of it is worthy of serious con *
liaeration.
Most of us have been attending the
>penings this week, and I have been espe
:ially interested in the displays of hats
md bonnets. Some were good, some were
>ad and several indifferent. However, I
elt amply repaid for my expenditure of
ime after investigating twenty or more of
he most chic of chapeaux tint ever left
:*aris. Every one showed that they had
seen selected with the greatest care by a
"Oman possessed of rare judgment and
aste, who certainly spent no less than
"o months in the gay capital choosing
lovelties that will delight even her most
fastidious customers. You must see a
French hat to appieciate fully its charms,
is even the most successful word-painters
fall far short of the mark, but I will at
tempt the description of a few of the mil
linery triumphs, each of which I found a
3ore temptation.
One love of a bonnet recalled a modified
colonial shapeâ that is to say, it has a
small brim and a dear little crown about
three inches high. It is composed of a
really beautiful shade of rose pink velvet,
a narrow edging of black ostrich feathers
surround it, and three or so good tips
stand up at one side. The lone pink taf
feta strings are edged with narrow black
Valenciennes lace. Near it reposed in a sub
stantial box a bonnet of canary velvet all
wrinkled and crinkled in a marvelous
manner, and every wrinkle and crinkle
was edged with real Valenciennes lace by
a creamy line. A touch of black gave it a
certain indescribable air quite delightful
and charming, and utterly different in
every respect was a third, which showed
how cleverly velvet, chenille and straw
can be handled. In it were blended two
shades of heliotrope, velvet with a touch
of white and some handsome jet.
An apricot velvet toque was much ad
mired by almost ever}' one, the rich vel
vet ana the truly exquisite-shaded roses
with their leaves will find a proper
resting-place, I trust, on the head ot a
beautiful brunette with a small oval face.
Another toque of quite a new shade of
crushed-strawberry velvet has a beaver
crown, roses matching the velvet, and
roses of a green shade are placed here and
there on the hat with excellent effect.
Chenille and straw are in high favor for
autumn wear and may be seen this winter
as well. A hat having a brim of a most
picturesque greenish straw mingled with
chenille of a darker shade has a crown of
fawn -colored felt. At either side are
bunches of black bird of paradise feathers
and here and there a small bow of black
watered moire ribbon.
I loat my neart to this creation until
1 realized the charms of a black one, in
which straw and cl enille were mingled,
and the very simple trimming consisted
of upstanding loop 3of white moire rib
bons with quillings on the edges of black
mousseline de soie, but all put together
in a certain way that but few milliners
understand, I almost forgot to mention a
unique bonnet which has two little crowns
of lovely oriental embroidery, done on
yellowish silk. The crowns are no le*s
odd than the rest ot the shape, which
looks like two black velvet triangles.
Black velvet and ostrich feathers also
enter into its complicated composition.
Some excellent English hats have also
arrived, which commend themselves
highly for morning wear. Mabcella.

DOGS IN WAR
Jrair\ir\g Gar\ii\e j^ets for
JMilitarvj Service
Since the Franco-Prussian war so many
innovations have been introduced and
have failed in the test of actual experience
in matters pertaining to war service that
we must regard it as practically a settled
matter when a nation like the Germans
maintains on a large scale an establish
ment for no other purpose than to train
dogs for war. But an experience of nearly
twenty years seems to have convinced
them, and there is no doubt but the next
war Germany is engaged in she will em
ploy on a large scale the dogs tiained for
the service of security and information.
The war dog will be particularly useful in
carrying reports to advanced patrols or
outposts and pickets, and also in assisting
outposts and in hunting up missing men.
It has been found that poodles, shepherd
dogs and bird dogs are the most suitable
for military training, but less atten
tion is paid to the breed of the
dog than to the purity of the breed
and me qualities necessary. These quali
ties are perfect health, a strong body with
broad chest, sinewy legs, acute ear and
nose, docility, watchfulness and gentle
ness. Of the three kinds named, poodles
are found the most docile, and are there
lore used for the purpose of instructing
young trainers in training young does.
Bat as they grow old they lose interest in
their wcrk and are then found Jacking.
TheshepnercJ dog is, in common with the
poodJe, exceedingly intelligent, has the
ability to withstand climatic changes,
and were it not for the element of affec
tion which is lacking he would be â¢ the
moÂ«t valuable of all breeds. The bird
dogs com Dine the good qualities of botn
the foregoing breedÃ, and are moreover
distinguished by a high sense of duty and
attachment. The more that they become
conscious that other things are required
of them, the more do they lose their in
clination for hunting.
The course a war doe goes through is
certainly interesting, and it Is surprising
to know that like their human com
panions-in-arms they are required to at
tain certain degrees .of proficiency in
their training before being advanced from I
one grade to another. As each degree is
attained a certificate is issued, and when
all is through another, which is practi
cally a diploma, is issued, in which is
stated the breed, the pedigree, the attain
ments, age and name and full description
of the animal, and the organization to
which the dog is assigned. T;e require
ments in training are to be obedient to
certain calls and signals, to carry mes
sages with certainty, to maintain com
munication between different posts and
sentinels, to be watchful and bring notice
to sentinels of the approach of strangers,
and to hunt up missing men, though on
this last point but little training is neces
sary. The training is effected by one of
two methods, depending on the nature
and cbaracter of the dog. The first is the
forcible method, in which a dog is kept
isolated to insure a complete subordina
tion of his will to his trainer, while the
second is the mild method, in which par
ticular stress is laid on the dog's intelli
gence by gentle and persuasive means.
The training is divided into three parts,
(1) guiding by the line or thong; (2) de
velopment of watchfulness; (3) the going
and returning. In order to be more easily
understood by the doe, each part is sub
divided into preparatory parts or stage*,
and aa the further the work progresses
the greater is the development of the
dog's intelligence, and therefore the easier
the training, it is necessary to pass from
one stage to another gradually and never
demand from the animal more than is iti
way he posed his sitter was not looked
upon as of any importance, although the
professor found it a most dimcult matter.
Since that time great improvements have
been made in the manipulation of the
telligible to him. When the dog compre
hends what is expected of him, the next
step is to fix what Is learned by a constant
practice. According to the difficulty of the
exercise is the amount of time required.
The fewer punishments meted out the bet
ter it speaks for both dog and trainer, and
rewards also are given out sparingly that
the dog shall not be led to expect any
thing more than kind words on doing
duty properly. In punishing, the trainer
is required to be absolutely certain that it
is a case of downright disobedience on
the part of the dog before inflicting it,
which is done by either a scolding or a
beating with a stick. While kind words
and gentleness are used from birth, yet
the proper training doe? not commence be
fore the dog is at least six months old.
The exercise under the first partâlead
ing with the leash â requires the dog, who
i-> fastened by a leash or strap, to walk on
the left-hand side of the trainer without
the latter having to hold the line taut in
his band. The leash is a calfskin strap,
a half inch wide, with the upper end ar
ranged for slinging, and having a buckle.
It is about three feet lone, and is termi
nated in its lower end with a strong snap.
Instruction in this exercise is commencsd
very early. The dog is not allowed to
leave barracks except fastened by the
leash. At first the animal will want to
run forward or stand fast, but a pull on
the line and petting him and talking will
soon make him understand what is ex
pected. Should he stretch the line or pull
it, a thin Switch is used, and the dog must
understand tnat he must pay attention to
the trainer and to nothing else. Soon the
dog will walk alongside his trainer, who
has hold of the upper en-d of the leash, and
will walk Â«aÂ«ily, so that the strap will
hanÂ» loosely. After this step is accom
plished thon comes the second or hieher
one of developing his watchfulness. This
quality is inborn in the dog, and but
needs training to develop it in the ri^lit
direction. It commences indoors. The
trainer with the dog is in a room, the sur
roundings of which are kept as quiet as
possible. An assistant trainer is then to
knock at the door. The dog's attention is
called to the noise and he is incited to
growl by the word "look oat," ana if the
dog should bark, this at first is not pre
vented. Tuen as he grows larger, stronger
and gains in self-confidence and courage,
he is taken at ni^hc, at which time his
hearing and alertness are more acute, to
some isolate! point, and after a little
while the assistant steals up on the wind
ward side, but at first not too quietly. If
the doe does not bark, he is incited to by
the trainer. Care, however, is taken that
he does not attack the assistant, as biting
dogs are not fit for military service, and.
at the same time, in this first training
none must act as assistant whom the dog
knows. After he has become accustomed
to giving notice of the approach of any one
He is then required to do it by a low growl
instead of barking, and then the more es
sential parts are taught him successively,
as when attached to a sentinel to give no
tice of the approach of Btrangers, and
when tied up to allow rÂ»o stranger to come
near.
Then comes the last and most valuable
part of the training â the "going and re
turning." By ihib is understood that when
led away from his trainer by an assistant
he can be sent back to the former, or when
taken back or away by the trainer he can
be scut to the assistant and then return to
the trainer. During this training he is
taught to run back and retneve lost
articles, to use the pouch, etc. The dis
tances at first do doc exceed a third of a

AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHY
FIGURE COMPOSITIOH
photographic plate. The time of exposure
has been cut down to the fraction of a sec
ond, and developers have been so per
fected that almost any kind of an exposure
can be made to yield eood results. That
is from the scientific point of view. An
under-exposed plate can be intensified so
as to be brilliant, and an over-exposed
plate can be handled so as to produce the
result of being properly timed. The modus
operand! has been so simplified that an
hour's instruction is enough to enable a
person of common-sense to make good,
sharp negatives. But the work of posing
the fieure, so as to produce an artistic re
sult, remains as difficult as ever.
It is true that the commercial pho
tographers have, by certain arrangements
of backgrounds and skylights, so simpli
fied their work that it is only a few mo
ments' work to pose their sitter end get
the negative, but they do not make pic
tures that would be satisfactory to an
artist, in fact, the average so-called
"studio" photograph is simply atrocious
and full of errors of light and shade. The
very best galleries in the country will turn
out pictures of people with tbe face show
ing white against a cloudless sky. This is
a condition that can be seldom seen in na
ture. An easy way to test It is to hold a
white card against the aky and see bow
black it looks. Of course, if the face was
against a dark sky and the sun struck one
side of it, that side would look lighter
than the sky, but the contrast would be
violent and unpleasant, and not at all as
the studio pictures look. Tne face of the
sitter, under these conditions, would also
be liKely to have a "screwed-up'* ex
pression, on account of the sun striking
the eyes.
Now it is all very well and proper from
a business standpoint for the commercial
photographer to do this. His sitters are
eeneraily in a hurry, and prices are so low
as a general thine thai he can waste no
time experimenting with art. He must
get the picture aut and get his money for
it or his business will fail. And as long
as the people who get the pictures are
pleased, who shall complain? But the
amateur photographer snould be aa artist
and endeavor to produce something better
than anybody has done before. Tiiis is no
more expensive than to follow in the old
conventional rut, as the materials cost no
more, but of course it takes more time
"WHO GOES THERE ?" â THE MAN AND THE DOG ON PICKET DUTY.
mile, and all points of the road, both going
ana returning, should be known to the
dog. Alter a lime when tent back the dog
is allowed to select liis own route. In
retrieving only very light articles are used
at first, as handkerchief;', cloves, etc. Such
moments as the dog shows an inclination
for this kind of work are taken advantage of
by the trainer.
The next step forward is with the a â
slstanca of the assistant. The latter
holds the article in the hand, open, and
walks away. After a time the trainer
sends the do^ after him by the call "for
ward," and the dog, running to the as
sistant, takes the articlo from the open
hand and brings it to the trainer. Then
the exercises are continued by the trainer
and dog remaining standing; the assistant
advances, or the latter remains standing
and the former advances, until it is im
material to the dog whether he run for
ward or back in order to letch the article
Then the initials and terminal points of
the course are selected so that they cannot
be seen from each other, and the dog
taugh t to retrieve over it.
When the degree of proficiency neces
sary to go and return properly is reached
the finishing touches of the dog's educa
tion are taken up. He is taught to swim, 1
to cross streams by command, to carry
small articles longer distances, then to do
the same work in the dark and to hunt
missing men. He is accustomed to the
sound of firearms and cannon, and taught
to avoid ever going in front of the latter.
He is then required to do all his work by
command of some other than nis trainer,
the latter being out of sight and
sound, and finally, as an incentive
to good trainers, competitions are neld,
under the supervision of officers of
high rank, and. silver and gold med
als are given to those attaining the
greatest results with their dogs. Then
comes the pract cal part of all this train
and study. There is where the pleasure
comes in, however.
There are two ways of posing the human
figure to make photographs of it â indoors
and out of doors. Both are proper and
artistic, but it is not artistic to make a
picture of a person indoors with a back
ground painted to produce the effect of an
out of doors scene. That is the old con
ventional way and the result will be in
accordance.
If you want to make a picture of a per
son out of doors, pose that person out of
doors and the result will be true to nature
at any rate. If you feel tnat a background
will be a handy thing for indoor use let it
represent some interior, with pleasing
architectural designs, or a flat conven
tional surlace. Possibly a circle painted
on it will come in handy at certain times.
But no result can be expected to come
from artificial paraphernalia that will equal
nature.
How much more pleasing pictures are
when taken out of doors than those made
indoors, to say nothing of the fact that
they will be all different. Look over the
samples of any commercial photographer
and observe the tiresome repetition of
background running through the work.
There will be a hundred different girls
sitting on the same log or standing by the
same gate or in front of the same land
scape, that is most likely out of perspec
tive. The commercial photographer can
not help this and cannot be blamed, but
the amateur can. If you intend to make
a picture of a friend pose him in his own
home or out beneath the eky.
It is not the purpose in this article to
consider the posing ot the figure with a
view to making portraits â that will be
considered at anotner time â but to con
sider it from an artistic standpoint. That
is to make it harmonize with its surround
ings and present a pleasing appearance.
As was dwelt upon in previous articles
the idea is to fill the space and make the
light and snade balance. Tbis must be
done whether the picture is taken indoors
or out of doors. The two accompanying
drawings will give an idea of what is
meant. One shows a natural scene out of
doors and the other an artificial effect
in doors, but arranged so as to be true to
nature as far as light and shade is con
cerned.
The first thing to do when posing a figure
ing. A pouch made of leather, five inches
lont; by two deeu and wide, is fastened to
the collar, and in it are placed the mes
sages. Those are always placed in ami
taken out in front of the dog, so that he
may see the action. He is then required
to carry his pouch over considerable dis
tances, varying from a half mile to sev
eral miles as he grows stronger. When
all is done satisfactorily ho receives his
diploma as an educated dog, a so-called
dog Bachelor of Arts. Tbis diploma
states his name, breed, amount of attain
ments and the battalion he belongs to.
Then on his collar is a metal plate on
which is engraved his company und bat
talion, and he becomes thenceforth t;.e
pet of :he company, but withal an edu
cated soldier, capable of doing a great
deal more of good to his friends or harm
to the enemy than many of his two
legged comrades. His food consists then
of the same food as is fed the soldiers,
together with dog cakes. He has a hospi
tal of his own in case of any sickness, and
it can be easily understood that men
would, next to their colors and officers,
fight lor their dogs and dogs' rights rather
than for other people.

KEEP MANY CATS.
RATS are getting to be a very serious
problem with the men who conduct
the big warehouses on the business streets
near the water front, and the person who
will invent some efficacious method of
driving them out of a building and keep
ing them out will not only be welcomed
with open arms, but will be amply remu
nerated for his discovery.
These figures may seem exaggerated, but
it is a fact that it costs each warehouse
from $50 to $100 a month to repair the dam
age to goods and building done by the
rodents, and the number of the pests
out of doors is to select the landscape
background. To begin with, Jet this be
simple, both in form and light and shade,
and if the idea is to show the figure do
not have any objects in it that will take
away from the figure. Pose the figure in
such position that the lines will balance
with the lines of the background. That is,
do not let the line formed by the branch
of a tree run parallel to one of the lines
that form the contour of the figure. Get as
much variety in the lines as possible. It
is best to keep the part of the picture near
the figure rather simpla, and let the part
above it be as broken as desired. This
will give the required variety. The fore
ground should be more broken or more
simple than the sky. A figure standing
in a tangle of weeds and a simple sky will
look well, as will also a simple foreground
and a sky broken by branches or rolling
clouds. If a figure is posed in a forest
where there are weeds in the foreeround,
let the upper part of the picture be dark
and simple. The style of background
should be selected to suit the costume.
If the dress-skirt is plain, get a broken
background, and if it is elaborate and cov
ered with trimming, let the background
be plain and simple. Rocks sometimes
answer very well, but they are hard to
handle because they are likely to produce
stranger effects of light and shade than
the figure. See that the figure looks
natural and that the background is pleas
ing, and the result will be surely satis
factory in many ways that will become
apparent the more the picture is studied.
The indoor composition is as simple a
pose as one could desire. It offers plenty
of opportunity for artistic draping and
almost any number oi changes of light
and shade. Tne background is so simple
that almost anybody can paint it. By
learning to do tbis the amateur can easily
have a large number of chances in indoor
work. For real artistic* worK the back
ground might be used for only one picture
and then changed to suit the next one.
In the accompanying drawing the figure
is made to fill tbe space, as the background
is of very little importance. The circle
on the flat tone gives variety.
The lines of this figure are simple in the
extreme, but they suit the background
and the style of costume. Almost any fig
ure will look well posed asainst a back
ground like this one, but tbe idea is to
seems to be rather on the increase than
otherwise.
Tnus far cats have been found to be the
best means of keeping down the rat crop,
and droves of felines are kept in every
estaolishment.
During the day, when the rodents are
lying quiet in their retreats, the cats are
not particularly noticeable, but after
nightfall, when the warehousemen have
gone home and darkness reigns in the
barn-like structures, fiery eyes peer from
every corner, and eaze eagerly and in
tently at places whence their owners know
the prey will come.
Aside from their natural instincts to kill
rats the cats have anotner reason for hunt
ing assiduously, and that is hunger.
Warehousemen want felines that will
slaughter steadily and persistently, and
have no room for lazy, well-fed cats, so
their rat-destroying animals are never fed,
but must catch their enemies or starve.
At the Eagle waredouse, 17 and 19 Davis
street, twenty rat-killers are constantly
employed weeding out the less cautious of
tne pests, and these felines destroy an
average of fifty rats per day and work
seven days in the week. The average of a
full-grown and ambitious cat is three rats
per day, and when they reach that degree
of efficiency they acquire a distinct com
mercial value, and are carefully protected
by their owners.
A few days ago a member of the Eagle
warehouse firm went to look at 500 bales
of twine that had been placed in a position
where it was supposed they would be saie
from rats, and lound to his chagrin that
almost every bale had been gnawed until
it was useless. As the loss falls on the
warehouse he was more than ever angry
at the whole rat tribe, and forthwith or
dered that an increased supply of the most
ferocious cats procurable be purchased.
His firm figures its loss from rats $75 per
month the year round.

SaVir\g tke poor Ghildrer\
From tke Street
This City is blessed with the most com
plete kindergarten system in the United
States.
This is a rather bold statement, but
nevertheless it is borne out to a certain ex
tent by the following interesting para
graph which appeared a few days ago in
the columns of tne Star, a leading weekly
published in one of the great Eastern
cities: '
One of the highest compliments to the
value of the kindergartens comes from San
Francisco. In that City the worst parts have
many kindergartens. Not lesÂ« than 20,000
children in the City of 300,000 have passed
from kindergartens to tha higher public '
schools, and it is said to be an almost unheard
of ttimg for a child who baa been two years in
a kindergarten to be guilty of a crime. If
this is true !Â«t other cities imitate the City of
the Golden Gate.
Indeed, the kindergarten system of San
Francisco is particularly well organized,
and the results of it are especially
gratifying. The schoolrooms are usually
in some conveniently situated tenement
in the very midst of ' a neighborhood
where poverty, squalor and children
abound, for the movement in this City is
primarily for the lifting up of the chil
dren of the poor. The first thing that im
presses one who chances to visit a district
in which a kindergarten is established is
the unusual neatness of the younger chil
dren.
This impression is deepened and broad
ened as the roomful of boys and girls is
viewed. It is an inspiring picture â not
pretty, for the clothes of these little one*
are designed more for use than ornameut,
but it is inspiring in the sense that it gives
hope for the future. A happier lot no one
would wish to see. They seem to be
merely playingâ making butterflies and
other beautiful things â but all the time
the sweet lessons of right and duty are
being taught them. These are not pure
white minds, to be taken by preceptors
and molded.
Unfortunately many of these little tab
lets have already been blurred and soiled
by familiarity with vice from the very first
gleam of consciousness. Tbe teacher's j
task is therefore doubly difficult, for the
tares must be uprooted in order to make
room for the lilies.
In a recent publication issued by the
Golden Gate Kindergarten Association
Miss Agnes Manning, a member of the
association, writes: "I wish to explain
why I am to much in favor of kindergar
tens. My school is in a crowded neighbor
hood. I have many children from tene
ment-houses and from the narrow streets
south of Market street. Before the days
of the kindergarten these children as soon
as they could crawl spent their waking
lives on the sidewalk.
"From the age of 2 to 6 years they pur
sued the education of the street. The con
sequence was that at 6 they came to us
with a fund of information of the worst
description and a vocabulary that would
excite the envy of the Barbary Coast. The
kindergarteno have changed all this. The
children of tenement-houses and narrow
3treets still come in tens, fifties and hun
dreds to b gin life in a new school at the
beginning of each term. I hea*-Â«*o more,
however, the wild phrases of the tender
loin or tbe rude drivers' oaths. The little
ones are clean, Belf-respecting, eager for
knowledge.
"They neither know how to read or write.
They have been taught to see, to observe,
to tell about what they have seen aud
heard. They have been taught to retjpect
older people, to be honest, to tell the
truth. It ia a rare tning now to find a
child that does not know it is wrong to
end the best way to do this is to mak
them natural. Pose a person in his
favorite corner at home or in a pretty bit
of woods and the result will be a picture

steal. If you meet such a one you may
know it has never been in a kindergarten.
I think you will now understand why I
am so strongly in favor of kindergartens."
In the same line is the opinion of Onief
of Police Crowley, who said:
"I can cheerfully bear witness to the
good accomplished by the establishment
of the free kindergartens in this City.
My opinion is based on reports that I have
received from police officers."
That hundreds of citizens hold similar
views is proved by the fact that the many
kindergartens of this City are kept open
at a yearly expense of $30,000, all of this
being derived from private subscriptions,
as the kindergartens have, not been en
grafted on the public-school system as
they should and ultimately will.be.
The Golden Gate Kindergarten Associ
ation has made a thorough investigation
of the careers of the first 9000 boys and
girls who passed through the kindergar
tens and were received by the schools.
The police records of this and neighbor
ing communities were searched and Dut
ono of the kindergarten children was
found who had ever been arrested. That
one was a half-witted boy, who was subse
quently committed to the asylum lor
feeble-minded children instead of being
sent to prison, so he can hardly be counted
against the kindergarten.
The total number of children trained up
to the present date in 24,000, and good re
ports are heard from all. Some of the
first graduates of the first kindergartens
established on Barbary Coast, the worst
part of the City, have grown to manhood
and womanhood and hold respectable po
sitions in the community. One is a prac
ticing attorney of acknowledged worth
and ability. These children of the poor
are, generally speaking, bright enough.
What they need is a helping nand in the
road to correct thinking and correct liv
ing. Thia helping hand the kindergarten
extends.
Professor Joseph O'Connor, principal of
the Horace Mann Grammar School, says
that he greatly favors the kindergarten
system for the children of the well to do
as well as ior the poor. Indeed he cannot
see why a condition of prosperity should
deprive any child of the great advantage
of such training. Accordingly he has
been instrumental in engrafting some of
Froebel's methods upon the work of the
primary grades of the public schools. All
the public school principals and teachers
agree that the kindeigartens are a blessing
to the community.
It is a well-known fact that from a single
neglected little girl in New York there
has come during the past fifty years an
army of 12,000 criminals and paupers, sn
tailins an expense of hundreds of thou
sands of dollars to the taxpayers of that
State. Considering this fact, who can es

XbÂ£-ComgL-lTiaLls_Coming and What May Be Expected if It Hits Us
A. recent telegraphic announcement from
one of tbe astronomical observatories situ
ated in the Southern Hemisphere tells of
the appearance of a large comet.
Ordinarily there is nothing startling in
such announcements. It is a matter of
every lay occurrence under the present
advanced state of astronomical science for
tbe observers to find a comet within the
field of view of their telescopes, and only
those of probable importance find mention
in the newspapers. Tbe one alluded to in
the dispatch mentioned is by some thought
to be the return of the great comet of
1880, whose giant tail measured at the time
of its last appearance over 150,000,000 miles
in length.
Because the ordinary observer fails to
perceive with the naked eye these wander*
ers of space, it must not be supposed that
their number is limited. The best astron
omers are agreed that the number of
comets is very great. Arago estimated
that there are at least 17.500.000 within the
orbit of Neptune. Lambert points out
where he thinks Arago neglected to in
vestigate, and places the number at over
500,000.000. Kepler says: "Comets are
scattered through the heavens with as
much profusion as the fishes in tbe sea."
From tbe beginning of tha Christian
era to the close of the present century
there is trustworthy record of about 1000,
of which we are fairly satisfied that prob
ably hal/ a dozen have returned. Proba
bly at least five have been seen to each
one recorded, so we may conclude that at
least 5000 have appeared during that time.
What has become of the immense number
which apparently visited our system but
once?
The theories put forward to account for
ti.e formation of comets are many. They
are all ingenious, but unproven. Cole, a
noted English observer, thinks it possible
that there are other emanations from the
sun and from the stars (which are other
sun=), besides that of light. If this be the
case the comets in their passage from one
system to the other may attract and col
lect the particles scattered in the immense
regions of space. This would account for
the very dense and extensive atmospheres
ooserved to surround most comets.
Professor Young of Dartmouth College
thinks that comets consist of matter
ejected from our sun and from other suns.
The North Pole and the Magnetic Pole Parted Company 1 2,000 Years A2O
It is a weil-known scientific fact that the
magnetic pole of the earth is not coinci
dent with the pole of revolution, but is
located about 70 degrees north latitude,
near King Will am- Land. The magnetic
poie is not a fixed point, but varies con
tinually, though slowly, pursuing a path
a^out the true pole, its shifting periods
estimated at 640 years.
One would naturally suppose that if the
axis of the earth since the beginning had
held a constant po-ition on inclination,
the two poles, that isâ the magnetic
and the revolutionary poles â would
be coincident, especially so when
we remember that, as the magnetic
pole is constantly moving at an appreciable
ra:e, it should by this time certainly
have found its center of influence. If it is
assumed, as it is by eminent philosophers
if not by geologists, that at one time the
magnetic pole nas coincident with tbe
revolutionary pole (about 12,000 years
ago), then the solution is apparent, and
since the change of axis of the magnetic
pole is moving in a spiral, its center will
again eventually coincide with tbe present
revolutionary pole.
Astronomy has pointed out that tbe
axis of the earth is still -wobbling." In
fact, it is a very suspicious wobble â a
wobble within a wobble, if you please â
tbe greater wobble having a period of 428
day*. It is surmised, too, that the greater
wobbling motion is but an epicycle of a
still greater wobble, which will account
for the poor orientation of the pyramid of
Ghizen, as well as the fact t at the sun,
when in Cancer, at Athens, doe* not come
so far north by a degree as it did 2000
years ago.
Xh.s .cads to the statement asserted witb
confidence and defended with assiduity,
that the revolutionary axis of tbe earth is
shifted periodically. And if this be true
it is of hf utmost importance to scien
tist-, explaining many events which have
been too much in the dark. Colonel Fred
G. Piummer, formerly State Geologist of
Washington, has recently publ shed an

The Queen Lily and the
Wheat Belong to One Tribe
QF THE many who admire the queen
lily now blooming in the park conserva
tory, few perhaps remember that it- mag
nificence is the outcome of a process of
change prolonged through countless anej,
during which environments favorable to
size and beauty were predominant, and
that each portion of its structure is trace
able to some corresponding portion,
foundation or possibility in the struciure
oi the unpretentious ancestor of the lily
family.
To tbe mind of the botanist who can
discern kindred traits in the most seem
ingly diverse species, and can trace th?
family tie between the giant ot the forest
and the scant h rbage of the mountain
peak, the lily tribe unfolds a marvelous
retrospect of evolutionary adjustment to
conditions. According to a noted au
thority the first flower boanical'y en
titled to be called a lily, though now ex
tinct, is fairly represented by the simple
marsh lily, the gagea depicted in the
illustration.
Many of the tribe blond with these
triple formations developments of their
own in the direction of growth, of beauty,
or ootb, while others lose some of the lily
traits, but, retaining the foundation, di
verge into a less ornamental form, just as
a modern storehouse may be constructed
from the ruined walls of a cÂ»stle. Ol the
first class the Victoria lily is the climax
though it also numbers in its ranks such
exquisite developments as the asphodel,
the tulip an t the orchid. Conspicuous in
the second class is the grass tribe in its
thousand varieties, includiug the familiar
stalk of cultivated wheat.
The gap between the latter and the
night- blooming lily, resting its large
blossoms and leaves on the deep water
and sensitively c anqing its color witb
the hours of day, seems a wide one, but it
has been bridged over by several plants
that probably represent the chief stages of

comets are composed of a blazing nucleus
and a mass of separated matter, such as
metalliferous stones, clay dust and gas.
The nucleus gives out intense heat and

It is claimed that the shifting of the

of continents, more especially Atlantis,
the presence of drift deposits, the bir;n of j
Niagara, the position of the magnetic

myths and traditions of all ancient
nations.
It has been stated as a fact by some
philosophers that upon several occasions
vast areas upon the eartu have been sud
denly changed, even in a single night,
from tropical and semi-tropical countries
into the bleak and bowling wildernesses
of a frigid zone. And this effect may
readily be accounted for by a shifting of
the axis, which movement controls the
different climates experienced with the
earth to a large extent.
In his book Mr. Plummer says:
The fact that the flora and fauna of the
earth are found in zone*, and that the fossils,
or former evidences of life, are not found In
zones coincident wltn our present lines of lati
tude, are enough to force tbe conclusion upon
any thinker that tne past has seen vast
changes of climate upon the earth. How, in
deed, may changes of climate occur so that
points of equal latitude will be affected
equally excepting by a chanÂ«?e of the earth's

The questions of greatest interest to the
majority of people are: Do comets exer
cise any influence upon tbe ear. h? Is
here any danger of a comet colliding with
the earth; and if so, what would be tbe
result?
A few comets have had their motions

equired by them to complete the tour of
their orbits. One of these, known as
Encke's, is a small affair of short period.

and that year was marked by a great fam

in 1080 when a terrible earthquake took
place. Its subsequent appearances, to

The second question may be answered
by the statement that already the eaith
has passed through the gaseous portion of
more than one comet, and it is believed by
good authority that she has passed through
the body of at least one comet within re
cent years. A certain short period comet,
known as Biela's, failed to appear at the
appointed time in 1872. Instead, there
was visible a very rich shower of meteors,
through which the earth passed Novem
ber 27 and 30. 1872. So certain were the
astronomers at this side of tbe globe that
the meteoric stream was Biela's comet dis
integrated that they telegraphed to tbe
observatory at Cape Town, in Africa, to
watch the skies for Biela's comet,
and sure enough the African ob
servers saw the fragments of the
comet receding from the earth. Did
the collision affect the earth? Let us see.
In October, 1871, the earth passed through
the gaseous envelope of Biela's comet, and
t enceforth the comet has not been seen
as a comet. It was broken up by its con
tact with the earth. But in October, 1871,
there occurred awful conflagrations in the
Northwestern States, devastating thou
sands of square miles of territory. The
testimony of the survivors of Minnesota
and elsewhere states that the flames would
su Idenly burst forth in the timber, ap
parently coming from the sky. The Chi
c a o fire occurred at that time also, where
solid granite buildings took fire and
burned as if of wood. Spectroscopic analy
sis tells us that the gaseous envelope of a
comet contains carburetted hydrogen. It
is a si tuple solution of the terrible confla
grations if it be recognized that a portion
of tbe gaseous envelope of Biela's cornel
became mixed with the earth's atmos
phere in October, 1871. The mixture forms
the most inflammable substance known.

velocity of movement of a comet varies,

and where tbe variation comes in. Th*

exists a something â call it force, if you

forces, and that passeth from meas

to manifest itself as energy when tbe

Some forces of nature lie dormant
until they are brought into contact with
other forces, and then when the combina

changed form. Let me illustrate this by
calling attention to the phenomenon of

It will be admitted by any student in
physics that tbe cracking o the earth's

molten material, would probably occur
along the equatorial Delt, if at all.
On the earth volcanoes are distributed
in groups, or along extensive lines, as if
connected with a fissure of the earth's
crust. The most remarkable linear series
of volcanoes in the world is that which
belts the Pacific Coast, as Professor Le
Conte of Berkeley has pointed out. Com
mencing with the Fuegian volcanoes, it
runs along tbe whole extent of tne Andes,
then along the Cordilleras of Mexico, the
Rocky Mountains, then along the Aleutian
chain of islands, Kamtchatka, the Kurile
Islands, Japan Islands, Philippines, Su
matra, St. Paul, Kerguli-n to the Antarctic
volcanoes, Mount Erebus and Terror,
thence back by Deception Island to Fuega
aeam, thus completely encircling the
gloÃe.
As mizht be expected, along such a line
of fissures tbe volcanic activity is on a
general scale, and it is likely to be mani
fested in several localities at the same
time. This was observed as early as 1835
by the great naturalist Darwin. Within
100 miles of Tacoma are not less than 200
volcanic peaks, the largest of which â
Mount Tacoma â is 15.000 feet high.
Alaskan volcanoes are frequently active,
and the eastern coast of Asia has an
established reputation for seismic dis
turbances. "In the physical formation of

When the earth's axis was perpendicular
to the plane of the ecliptic, tbe north pole
was somewhere in the vicinity of the
Mediterranean and possessed a delightful
and perpetual sprin- climate. This fact
calls to mind tbe biblical Garden of Eden,
Plato's AUant s and the Garden of the
Hesperides, and concerning these interest

Only One Secret Necessary
to Turn Silver Into Gold
breaking it a globule of yellow metal was
found in the bottom, and in 'he scoiia
were smaller ones, all together weighing
ten prams. Thorough tests were made
with the yellow metal and it was proven
to be pure gold.
Similar experiments were then made,
except that a white powder was added, in
stead of th" red, the result beiue a large
bead of white metal. The gold and silver
thus obtained were submitted to an as
sayer and refiner, both of whom at once
The Eriocaulon, or Pipework
affirmed the impossibility of success of
such a process, and denied the purity of
the metals. But tbe assay instantly dissi
pated their doubts, and they acknowl
edged, with amazement, that the metals
were entirely pure, and gave official cer
tifi ate Ã to that effect. Detailed accounts
similar to the above might be multiplied
by the score, if one detired to ao so. Iv
pure water. The solution will remain
c.'cur for an indefinite period if the solu
tion be undisturbed, but attach a micro
scopic octahedrai crystal of the salt to the
finest filament and lower it into the solu
tion. Instantly crystallization commences
at the surface of ihe fluid and progresses
with great rapidity until every atom of
alum in the solu'uon is visible. Now, the
comet is simi>ly a microscopic crystal
crystallizing, i. c., changing the forms of
radiant light and heat into other modes
of motion, wb.ch, in the fullness of their
functions, eventually return back to the
originals.
Ever since comets have been observed a
great deal of speculation has been in
dulged in as to what constituted the tail
of the comet, and some very ingenious
theories have been elaborated to account
for the fact that the tail, whi c observed at
a considerable angle with a line <;rawn to
the sun, and even at right angles to it,
constantly inclines toward the region
from which the comet is moving â always
away from the sun. It is difficult to con
ceive how the tail of the comet of 1880,
150,000,000 miles in length, could in the
spuce of time occupied by the comet-head
in sweeping around the sunâ a period of a
few minutes of timeâ describe so tremen
dous an arc in space in so short a time. If
the tall did actually sweep around the
particles at its extremity must have trav
elea with a velocity utterly inconceivable
to tbe human mind. No known law of
nature can explain tho sudden shift of
position.
Generally the tail is curved, resembling
a scimitar, but many have been observed
of extremely fantastic appearance. One
is recorded as having been seen at the time
of Constantine tbe Great, shaped like a
cross, and the imaginative superstition of
that age discerned beneath it the legend:
"In hoc signes vinces." In this case the
comet did some good. Perhaps we may
be able in coming years, when ihese mat
ters are better understood, to use these
wanderers as messengers to bear our com
munications to other spheres. Of one
thing we may be morally certain â that if
a i reat comet should appear before the
close of this year, the disappointed politi
cal party will, beyond all doubt, charge
their defeat to the comet.

by the mutation and precession of the equi

There is one point of importance that
should be noticed. Of course, if the poles
have changed there has resulted a corre

Do we find any evidence of such a change,

note?

alchemist and magician. It is, because of
its present constitution, one of the rarest
curios in the world, and should, of itself,
even if there were no other evidence, be

An int resting story ol alchemy comes
from one of the middle States of Germany.
The tale dates from the middle ages. A
traveler sought shelter at the castle of a
Baron one stormy winter right. The lord
oi the manor was away, but tbe Baroness
su'plieu him with food and lodging. Be
fore the stranger departed the next morn
insr he sought the lady of the castle and
expressed ins thanks for ncr hospitality.
He s<iid he had no money, but perhaps he
could repay her m another way. She re
plied that she desired nothing in return,
but he a^k'-d her if she aid not have some
siiver iv the house she would like to
have turned into gold. Acorditigly all
the silver plate was brought forth and
transmuted.
When the . Baron returned home and
saw the gold he immediately, laid claim to
it .under a law winch i>ave the owner of
land all treasure found upon it. His .wife
res;sted the demand, and he noble couple
resorted to the courts for a settlement of
the owner-hip. The Judge rendered a
decision (which may be found in the Ger
man archives) to the effect â¢ that the gold
was the sole property of the Baroness, for
the reason tha the treasure had not been
'â¢found"- on the Baron's lands, but had
been "manufactured" tor the Baroness at
her request and as a personal gift to her.
The .Baron 'might have formerly had some
claim on the silver plate belonging to the
castle, but comparatively small value of
that was overshadowed by. the great value
o the gold, and he was entitled to recover
nothing from the Baroness beyond the
value of the silver that had di appeared.

THE
DISCONTENTED
KING.
A TALB OP THE SANDMAN (COKCLTTDID).
B\j Rebecca J. QradWoM.
While things were in this state among
the people, affairs were not much better at
the palace. It is true the King was able
to sleep, but the Queen was not, and
whenever he fell into a nice doze she woke
him up and confided to him the fact that
she could'not sleep. And when he seemed
insensible to her wakefulness she scolded
him. So the first night of his edict was
anything but agreeable. Then the next
day the servants were tired and cross and
neglected their work. The courtiers were
so weary they could not flatter the King.
The poor usually brilliant Prime Minis
ter was so dull be could not attend to the
affairs of the kingdom. And as for the
Queen, after vain attempts to sleep during
the day, her temper was such that her
weary ladies trembled in her presence.
By the third day the King was so irrit
able and nervous, he regretted with all
his heart his hasty decree. When he
heard the shouts of the people as they ap
proached the castle, he shook with terror
and cried:
"Alas, what trouble discontent brings!
Had I only been satisfied with things as
they were this had never been."
He looked out of the window and his
eyes fell upon a sorry spectacle. The
men were pale and hollow-eyed and so
weak they could scarcely walk. The
women, who had come too, were haggard
and their sharp voices scolding their cry
ing children, who clung to them, re
minded the King so strongly of the
Queen's reprimands that he shivered.
"What would the people have?" he
asked.
One man, who had been chosen as
spokesman, came forward.
"We demand, 0 King, that we be re
stored to the right of sleep which thou
hast taken from us. If we sleep not to
nignt, to-morrow tnere will be blood
shed."
The King, forgetting what the wizard
had said, replied quickly:
"Go to your homes. To-night ye Bhall
sleep."
When the people had departed snd the
King sat in his council-room, a great dread
came upon him. He feared the punish
ment might never be revoked. However,
he again summoned the magician.
Tne man came and the King said :
"Remove this plague thou hast called
forth."
"Alas I O King, thou knoweit I have not
the nower."
"Think of some way by which sleep may
be restored to the people or ere the day
passes thy Head shall be forfeited.' 7
At this the magician began to think and
finally said:
"Beneath the sands on the beach near
by dwells the sandman. He alone can
bring relief. But only a great sandstorm
can bring him to the surface. The castle,
owing to its situation, will feel the storm
the most. Shall I invoke it?"
"Invoke it," said the King. "It cannot
be worse that the present state of things."
The wizard went to a window that over
looked the ocean, and waved his hand
three times. Suddenly a terrible wind
sprang up. It shook the castle from tur
ret to vault. The sand was whirled
around with such force that it broke the
windows, and entering the castle covered
the beautiful carpets and costly furniture.
The inmates were so frightened they crept
into bed. The poor King lay trembling
beneath the bed clothes, and the Queen
with chattering teeth reminded him tbat
it was all his fault
The storm lasted an hour and waa
scarcely felt beyond the castla. At its
close the King ventured to look up, and
he saw before him a tiny man no bieger
than his own hand. His complexion, his
eyes and his hair were the color of sand,
and his clothes seemed of a sandy texture.
On his back he carried a diminutive sack
filled with sand, and in his hand he held
a minute tube.
"Who art thou?" demanded the King.
"I am the sandman," was the reply in
a gritty tone, and for a moment the King
saw no one.
"Alas!" cried the King, "he has gone."
"Oh, no; I am here," and he reap
peared. "I simply made myself invisible,
fox in this form I enter people's homes,
and dropping a few grains of sand into
open eyes I produce sleep."
"Good," answered the delighted King.
"And, if you please," he continued in a
very humble voice for one of so high de
gree, "commence with the Queen."
So in peaceful slumber the troubles of
the kingdom passed away. The next day
when the people were told of the sand
man's visit they declared it was he who
had always brought sleep; that the evil
power of the magician had always exor
cised him and only a Bevere sandstorm
could bring him back. Thereafter, when
ever any cne looked sleepy, they said,
"The sandman is coming," and the ex
pression became a familiar one in the king
dom and finally spread to other lands.

THE YOUNG
ARTIST
BY MABY KATHEBIKS CBOWLEY.
About fifty years ago there lived in a
small house on an obscure street of Lon
don a boy named John.
Although he was fond of boyish games
from the time when he was a very little
fellow there was one thing that John
loved even better than play, and that was
to make pictures. The walls of the house,
the doors and in some cases even the ceil
ings were covered with sketches in char
coal or crayon; and poor John was the
worst boy to send on an errand, for he
was sure to be diverted by something he
saw on the way and would stop to
draw a picture of it on the
side of a building or occasionally
on the back of his jacket, which be
would sli^off for the purpose. This some
times brought him into trouble. His
mother was usually very patient witb him,
however, for the had a mother's faith in
his talents, and his -father acknowledged
that "after all the young rascal's pictures
were uncommonly good."
Others soon began to think so too.
When John was 9 years old a little sketch
of his won a silver medal from the Society
of Arts. He then entered a regular class
at the Royal Academy, and gained two
more medals. But all this was long be
fore the opening of our story.
He was now a tall, prepossessine young
fellow, and some people said he ought to
be better employed than in dawdling with
colors and canvas. There are always
busybodiea who claim to be competent
judges in such matters. Perhaps in this
instance they had a show of reason on
their aide, too, for, although John had
done much clever work since the day his
mother beheld his little jacket decorated,
not with chalk marks aeain, but with his
first shining medal, his skill had not
gained him anything but honors and
encouraging words. His parents were
growing old; they had made many sacri
fices that he might pursue his studies,
and now they were badly off for funds.
"Don't worry, mother; it will be all
right, father," he told them cheerily.
"Keep up your spirits until my 'Ferdi
nand' is finished. It is the best thing I
have done and cannot fail to bring a good
price."
And so they hoped on and he painted
steadily, trying to portray his beautiful
ideal. The subject was "Ferdinand and
Ariel," from Shakespeare* play, "The
Tempest."
One day he persuaded the dealer to go
and look at the picture. The man, after
examining it carefully, said:
"It promises well. When it is com
pleted, if I like it as much as I do now, I
will give you Â£100 lor it."
At this good news there was great re
joicing in the little home. John worked
with new enthusiasm. As the picture
grew more beautiful every day they
naturally regarded it as Bold.
At last it was finished. John's father
and mother, and trie few friends to whom
be exhibited it, were loud in its praise,
and the young artist, in high spirits, and
feeling already the joy of success, brought
the dealer to see it. But alas I the man
had cnanged bis mind in the interval, or
he was out of humor, or some detail did
not please him ; at any rate, he looked the
picture over coldly and finally said: "I
spoke of buying your picture if I liked it,
but 1 don't like it and I won't take it.
Good-morning."
Turning on his heel, he was gone before
the unfortunate painter could realize what
had happened. The consciousness came
soon enough, however, and then John
faltered, wondering how he was to tell the
â Yovths' Companion.

old people. But he was not one to shirk a
duty because it was a hard one, and so he
went to the sitting-room where they were
awaiting the verdict with calm confidence.
At he entered they felt at once that all
was not well, for his face was pale and his
hand trembled.
"Father 1 Mother!" be said, "I have
failed. The picture has been refused."
"Refused? Impossible!" they exclaimed.
"Yes, he will not have it at all. What
a useless fellow I am 1 - Not much help to
you, mother."
John was thoroughly disheartened. His
father said nothing, but he could see that

the old man wu troubled, pondering bow
sundry small debts were now to be paid.
To his surprise, however, bis mother sud
denly became cheery, as mothers do when
everything looks darkest.
"Never mind, my dear boy," Bhe cried,
laying her hand affectionately upon his
arm. "Why should you be discouraged?
Perhaps you will get a better price for
your picture from some one else. God has
given you the talents of an artist and you
will be sure to succeed in the end."
"But how are we to get along in the
meantime?" he sighed gloomily.
"Oh, as to that," she went on briskly,
"we could give up the rooms on the first
floor and they would make comfortable
quarters for persons coming up to London
lor a few months. Two or three good
lodgers would help to pay the rent, and
by being careful and economical we shall
be able to manage, so take heart, fqr for
tune comes when least expected."
The next morning the sign "Furnished
Apartments" appeared in the front parlor
window, and the young artist, after a sad
glance at Ferdinand and Ariel, resolutely
turned it to the wall and set to work upon
another canvas.
Nearly three weeks had passed when
one morning the brass knocker upon the
street door was rattled imperatively and
presently two persons were shown up to
the studio. One was a man who some
times dropped in "just to Jook around,"
as he said, the other, an antiquated little
old gentleman with grizzly hair and
beard and a blue coat ornamented with
brass buttons.
This latter visitor was rather eccentric
and flitted about the room examining
Johu's sketches with curiosity and inter
eat, and occasionally pulling out a canvas
that had been stowed away. He seecaed
to be very fond of paintings and to know
a great deal about them. Chatting on in
a friendly manner he soon learned the
story of the "Ferdinand" and John's dis
appointment.
"Tut-tut 1 too bad!" he exclaimed.
"And what did you do with it then?"
"Here it is," replied John, dragging it
from a corner and setting it upon the
easel.
The old gentleman contemplated it for a
long time in silence. John watched him
narrowly. At last the queer visitor took
oQ his spectacles and said:
"Humph! so he wouldn't take it 1 Well
don't be discouraged. Your work is ex
cellent and success will come after a while,
Jtfut, of course, you have still much to
learn. Now here is a book," he continued,
taking a iitt.'e volume from bis pocket,
"which contains some practical advice to
young painters. I should be pleased to
present it to you if you will promise to
read it."
John bowed somewhat stiffly and said
he would read the book.
"Then get me a pen and ink, and I'll
write your name in It," the old gentleman
went on fussily.
John opened a secretary, placed the ink
bottle and a quill pen before him, and
walking away to the window, stood gazing
out into the street. Presently the old
gentleman joined him, and put the book
into his hands, saying:
"Be sure to read it. It will do you
eood. Be sure to read it."
He and his companion then took leave,
and John, after letting them out at the
hall door, again climbed the stairs leading
to the studio.
"What a strange old fellow! " he said to
himself. 'Oh, here is tho book he left.
Will people ever learn that the most help
ful words to young artists are those writ
ten upon a check?" â¢
As he opened the book a bit of rarer
fluttered to the floor. John picked it up
and gazed at it in bewilderment It was
a check and for a hundred and fifty
guineas, with the old gentleman's signa
ture at the end. On the flyleaf of the littie
volume were written a few words, saying
that the money was offered for the "Fer
dinand."
"Bravo!" cried the youth, recovering
himself and leaping down the stairs
several steps at a time. "Father!
Mother! The picture is sold!"
Then, striding to the front parlor win
dow, he took down the card which adver
tised "Furnished apartments' and tore it
Into bits. His mother never had ! occasion
to put up another, for . from that day her

THE
STAGE
New York theaters are bristling with as
many novelties as if McKinley had already
been elected, and the prosperity of which
he is the advance agent had become an
actual fact. Croakers said that theaters
in Gotham would not do anything till
after t c Presidential election, and that
managers who tried putting on new plays
would have to spell the word bankruptcy.
However, their predictions have come to
naught, and the people who predicted a
disastrous season are lying low and say
ing nothing.
In the coming by-and-by we may see
some of the novelties ourselves, but in ibe
meantime San Francisco managers prefer
a masterly inactivity till after the Presi
dential election. The California will put
up its shutters to-night till the fate of the
Nation is decided. The Baldwin will also
remain dark for part of the time between
now and November, and the other theaters
are not promising much in the way of
new productions. An augmented com
pany is coming to the Grand this week,
but the plays in which Mr. Stockwell and
his company are to appear are old familiar
friends. The Tivoli promises a grand
6cenic revival of "Aida," and that ia the
greatest novelty ahead, for though the
African opera is almost as well known as
the "Trovatore," to see it handsomely put
on the stage will be something absolutely
new to San Francisco theater-goers.
Goivimbia Jheater.
The Frawley Company, which kept its
patrons laughing all last week in farce
comedy, will this week produce a strongly
dramatic play, adapted by the late StÂ«ele
Mackaye from Sardou's "A<j;nes," called
"In Spite of All." The work was success
fully presented in the East last season by
Minnie Maddern Fiske.
The play is founded upon a story of the
affections, its leading motive being the
efforts of a young wife to keep the love of
her husband, who is very much infatuated
with a celebrated dancer who has just
created a sensation in America. In the
effort not to let her husband slip through
her hands the wife goes in disguise to the
dressing-room of the dancer and makes an
appeal to her better nature. After a
series of dramatic incidents the actress
finally turns her efforts to keeping the
husband and wife from drifting apart, and
the curtain falls on the happy reunion of
the couple.
The Frawley Company only has two
weeks more to play at the Columbia
Theater, after which it will go to Hono
lulu.
BaldWin Theater.
Commencing with to-morrow evening
the Baldwin will be dark for a couple of
weeks preparatory to opening for the fall
and winter season on Monday, October 5,
with "The Prisoner of Zenda," which is
at present playing at Hooly's Theater,
Chicago, and repeating its success of last
season.
JamesK. Hackett, who heads the cast of
Frohman's company, is a stalwart youth
of 27, the son of the famous "Fafstaff"
Hackett of other days.
California Jheater.
Steve Brodie and his play, "On the
Bowery," will close a successful engage
ment of two weeKs at the California The
ater this evening. This house will then be
dark until after the elections, wlien it will
reopen with Grattan Donelly's "Darkest
Russia."
Qrand Opera-House.
Manager Morosco of the Grand Opera
house has chosen an auspicious time for
introducing a strong company to the
t beater-goers of Ban Francisco. With the
Baldwin and the California closed the ad
vent of such well-known people as L, tL
Stcckwell, Victory Ba;eman and Howard
Kyis in a bouse with popular prices prom
is, sio be a successful move. Mr. Stock
well and Miss Bateiuan open to-morrow
evening in "Mr. Potter of Texas," with
Stuckwell in the title role and Miss Bate
moo as Lady Annerly. Mr. Kyle has been
delayed and so will not make his first ap
pearance till a week later.
Victory Bateman is well known to San
Francisco audiences. She was one of the
few successes of the old Stockwell Theater,
now the Columbia. Although still young,
she has made a name for herself on the
American stage, which is not surprising,
as she was born in a theatrical atmosphere
and was educated in the company of her
uncle, Edwin Booth.
Kyle was leading man for Modjesta
during two seasons. KtocKwell is too well
known to need a word of mention. With
the above performers will appear Lottie
Williams, Edward Heron, Julia Blanc and
Frank Hatch.
The play for this week is a dramatiza
tion of Mr. Gunters popular novel, "Mr.
Potter of Texas." It will be set off with
new and striking scenery.
Â» . Alcazar Jheater.
To-morrow night Augustin Daly's so
ciety comedy "Divorce" will be produced
at the Alcazar Theater. .
It is a play in four acts, the first scene
opening in New .York City. The location
is transferred successively to Long Island,
New York, Florida and to New York
again, where, the story is broug ;t to a
close. In the first act the various court
ships and marriages, all of a different
character, are established.. Later the vari
ous jealousies, domestic troubles and
matrimonial differences arise , and the
comical and serious sides of divorce are ex
ploited. Matters are filially happily ad
justed, though in certain instances not
without leaving a sting.
John T. Sullivan will be seen as Alfred
Adriance, Carl Smith as Captain Lynde,
F. B. Clayton as Rev. Harry Duncan, J.
B. Polk as De Wolf de Witt, Frank Doane
as Templeton Jitt, Gordon Foster as Mr.

Tiv>oli Opera-j^ouse.
The season of grand opera is announced
to end next week at the Tivoli. â¢ Most of
the artists who began the season will ap
pear this week in farewell performances.
The feature of the closing season will be
a scenic revival of Verdi's "Aida." In
order to give more time to the prepara
tion of this work it will not be put on till
Wednesday. , To-morrow "The Hugue
nots" will be given, and on Tuesday "The
Bohemian Girl," with the same cast as
heretofore. \
The cast of "Aida" will include: Mme.
Natali and Ida Valerga, alternately, as

nice Holmes as Amneus, the Egyptian
princess; big. Abramoff as Ramfis; Big.

Company, will make his San Francisco
debut as Radames. * <
. After the run of "Aida" Balfe's "Sata

At the Orpheum.
Three .'new turns are billed at the Or

expected from Master Walter Leon, the
boy actor, mimic and vocalist. Leon

London. The London Daily News says of
him, "the caricature in each case is so
close and so amusing that one wonders
how so yonng a child can have observed
so much." He is now 9 years of ace.

Lorir\g Glub Concert.
The Loring Club announces the first
concert of their twentieth season for the
evening of Tuesday, the 22d inst., at
Odd Fellows' Hall. There are several
items of exceptional interest on the pro
gramme, perhaps the principal one being
a composition by Oebois, "Mysterious
Night," for male chorus with violin obli
gate This will be the first performance
of this composition in San Francisco.
The violin obligato is a very important
solo and John Marquardt has been engaged
as soloist for this occasion. Advantage of
his presence has been taken to include in
the programme another number for male
chorus with violin obligato, and he will
also play a solo. Among the other chorus
numbers are Mohr's "Hymn of Praise"
and Foote's "Farewell of Hiawalhi."
The club has engaged as soprano soloist
for the evening, Miss Adeiia Brown of
New York. The concert will be under the
direction of the conductor of the club,
D. P. Hughes.

The week has been a lively one out at
the Chutes. What with open air perform
ances, Antonio Pirri's daring bicycle rides
down the slide into the lake, and political
demonstrations things have been hum
ming.
The latest attraction is the "Animato
scope," a kinitoscope which throws life
sized figures in motion on a screen. It in
cludes all the good features of the vita
scope with several important improve
ments. A humber of local scenes are repro
duced, including a view on Kearny street.
The bill in the Casino has some new faces,
including Mabel Maitland, a contortiou
dancer, Louis Meyers, the "King of Clubs,"
and "Musical 1 Fletcher, who playa every
instrument conceivable and inconceivable.
The two young ladies continue to give
their stationary miie bicycle race and Pirri
is retained.
Regular matinees are given Saturdays
and Sundays, and tbe evening perform
ances begin at half-past 8.
BRET HARJE'S "SUE."
Jhe Western Writer jViakes a First
yUtempt at flay Writing.
Bret Harte has made his first attempt at
playwriting in a drama called "Sue,"
which is to be produced at Hoyt's Theater,
New York, on Tuesday night. It is rathe
late in life for Bret Harte to begin, but all
the successful novelists and short-story
writers are taking to the drama nowadays,
so Harte naturally wants to be in the
swim. He has taken as his collaborator J.
Edgar Pemberton, who probably helped
him in constructing tho plot.
"Sue" is announced as a Western story,
with enough atmosphere and coloring to
give it interest even if the plot flags. Like
nio.-it of Bret Hart-'s work it depicts the
California of early days.
The young la Jy who gives her name to
the play is the daughter of a Sierra Nevada
miner. She is a charming type of the
inexperienced and guileless girl, whose
shrine is the ragged hills and whose creed
is the same as theirs.
_ She has been brought up in the camp,
ana one would think: would be wedded to
its picturesque types and rude ways ; bat
she is not. The girl has dreams ana hopes
built upon some vague notions of the out
side world, and is not reconciled to her
narrow environment.
Her father selects a husband for her,
and, in pursuance of the crude plans she
has formed for her own future, she accepts
the suitor and becomes bis wife.
Her intention is of the very best, but
along comes a young man, who stops in
the camp long enough to win Sue's fancy.
It is at this point, where the young wife
wavers between love and duty, that the
dramatist takes up the â¢ characters and
story and builds up their complications.
Many intensely dramatic situations are
said to result, and the solution of all the
trouble is not reached until the last act,
which is a characteristic Bret Harte trial
scene.
//V, Local piayright. .- :
Society circles are interesied in the forth
coming production at the California Thea
ter of the comedy-drama "Back%o the Old
Home," which has been written by Lotta
Day Coleman. The authoress is a Native
Daughter of the Golden West and. was
born in Marysville in June, 1872, and was
educated in the schools of that city, re
ceiving her finishing education at a pri
vate seminary. Mrs. Coleman has ; trav
eled extensively ail over America, and the
play she has written is said to be : the re
sult of a .close observation of nature and
the careful study of the inhabitants of
Vermont, where the scenes of "Back to
the Old Home" are laid. A professional
company has been engaged by the author
ess, and is now rehearsing under her di
rection, and the production at the Califor
nia Theater this month of Mrs. Coleman's
play will be watched by her numerous
friends with considerable interest.
/V Qilded Offer.
De "Wolf Hopper recently received the
following proposition by â¢ letter f rom a
New York clubman: "If you will let me
play the part of , Edmund -Stanley in 'El
tapitari' for one night only I will pay his
salary for a week and give you $100 be
sides." Hopper was mystified 'at this
offer until the letter was shown to Nella
Bergen, who plays the part of Stanley's
sweetheart. The pretty blonde prima
donna recognized the letter as that of a
lovelorn youth who had written her sev
eral amatory letters and had vainly sought
to make her acquaintance. Hopper re
fused the youth's gilded offer, but what a
pretty story it would have made had he
accepted, for then the lady would have
been forced to listen to the bona fide pro
testations of a supposedly make-believe
lover who had paid for the privilege.
DoWr\ir\g's J^JeW Play.
"In Search of Happiness," the play
which Robert Downing produced for the
first time in this country in Washington
last Monday evening at the National Tne
ater, was originally written for John Me-
Cullough. Longfellow, It is said, once
pronounced it an unusually strong play
and wrote a letter to the tragedian asking
him to produce the play in Boston. The
play, which was originally written in the
English language, has been translated
into the Greek by a well-known American
scholar and is said to have achieved suc
cess in the capital of Greece. "In Search
of Happiness" is a pathetic play dealing
with the strongest of human passions â
love and honor â honor on the part of man,
love on the part of woman. And the most
unexpected denouement is finally reached.
Jk Juicy Retort.
There is a young lady in one of Charles
H. Hoyt's companies of whom the play
wright manager expects great things.
Here is a sample of her wit, of which Mr.
Hoy t likes to tell: , -
It appears that the young lady, who may
be donominated as Miss ll., was an artist's
model before she went on the stage. One
day he heard that a certain artist was in
search of a model, and presented herself
as an applicant.
"But, my dear," said the artist, "I paint
fruii pictures, andâ"
"Well, that's all right," retorted Miss
H., "I'm a peach."
Lillian's Retort
"I met Patti once," remarked Lillian
Russell to George Lederer, during one of
the pauses at a rehearsal of "An American
Beauty." "It was at a hotel in St. Louis.
She was walking in the corridor smoking
a cigarette.
"'Oh, you are the young girl I heard
sing last night,' she said. 'You have a
wonderfully beautiful voice. Take good
care of it.'
" 'If 1 follow your example,' I replied,
with a significant glance at the cigarette
smoke, 'I won't have it long.'
"Patti laughed and shrugged her shoul
ders. 'Oh, you mustn't mind me,' she
added, 'I'm an old woman " ~

cnJCAGO.'ILi.'. Bept. 79.â There was a good
demand for wheat this morning, a well defined
1 conviction that this was to be another bull day
making its appearance before the market opened,
and continuing to possess the minds of traders for
some time after trading began. But the strong
tone gradually changed into one in which less con
fidence was displayed, and prices receded moder
ately, ad advance of %(Â£%d at Liverpool and

A WONDEEFUL WISCONSIN MAN.
He Has Worked Ten Tears on Fifteen
Cabinets.
Oat in tbe wilds of Wisconsin in the
little rural village of Martintown, Green
County, lives one of tbe most industrious
men of the century, aays the New York
World. He is Peter Haase, a cabinet
maker. Ten years ago be conceived the
idea and perfected plans in detail of ibe
most ingenious and elaborate combination
bookcase and writing-cabinet in tbe world.
Having saved enough money to support
him the remainder of his life, he began
the construction of not only one of these
cabinets, but of fifteen, finishing a certain
part of each at the same time before ad
vancing farther.
The cabinets are inlaid with all of the
native woods, the boards having been io
his shop seasoning for over eighteen years.
When completed the fifteen cabinets will
contain 4,000,000 pieces of wood. Some
idea of the time required for the
completion of this undertaking may be
had bj knowine that it would take a man
working eight hours a day one year to
simply sort and count a million pieces,
many of which will have to be handled
twenty times by Mr. Haase before being
permanently adjusted. The top of each
cabinet is to contain 17.000 pieces and each
of the posts 4000. The aged workman
figures that it will take him six years more
to finish his work and the fifteen pieces of
furniture will be completed at the same
time.
Mr. Haas is 71 years of age, but is ha>,
hearty and full of hope and determination
to complete this wonderful work, to which
he applies himself enthusiastically every
workday. His patience and perseverance
are remarkable. He counts on each cabi
net being worth $5000â 575,000 for the lot â
when completed, and believes that invest
ing his time in making them will prove
more profitable than spending bis money
on life insurance would have been.

FAIR SISTERS
DID NOT DEPOSE
Having Withdrawn Their
Petition for Probate of
the Pencil Will.
HAVE JOINED CHARLES.
Richard V. Dey Spends an In
teresting Hour in the
Chair.
HE "DECLINES TO ANSWER."
Admits Having Said That the Pencil
Will Was Written in the Hand
writing of Fair.
Miss Virginia Fair and Mrs. Theresa
Oelricbs were summoned to appear before
Notary Charles H. Phillips in the Crocker
building yesterday in the matter of the
Fair will. With their attorney, Reuben
Lloyd, they were present, but Mr. Delmas
dismissed them in a few words, saying
tbat inasmuch as they had since being
subpenaed withdrawn their application
for the probate of the will of the 24th,
known as the pencil will, the situation
had been thereby changed and their depo
sition would not be necessary.
"I wish the reporter would note that
Mrs. Oelrichs and Miss Fair have re
sponded to the subpena, are here and are
willing to tell anything they may know
about the matter being heard," said Mr.
Lloyd.
"We will go on with the next deposi
tion," said Mr. Delmas without looking up.
"Then the presence of these ladies is no
longer required?" asked Lloyd.
"I have said all that need be said as to
that," replied Delmas.
The ladies rose and, accompanied by
Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Russell Wilson, left
the room. Mr. Wilson's was the "next
deposition." He came Dack in a moment
and stating that he would "decline to be
sworn," and that he wished, however, to
"keep the record straight" for the return
to court, again bowea himself out, still
accompanied by Mr. Lloyd.
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven, the central figure
of the contention, now arrived, accora-.
panied by her physician, Dr. Clinton. She
apparently did not know that she was ex
pected to give her deposition. it was her
first appearance in the circle of lawyers
and lookers-on, artists and newspaper
men outside her own house since she left
the witness stand that night in Judge
Slack's courtroom several months ago.
She â¢ made a very fine appearance, too, it
may be said, dressed in a natty suit of
green, with a green ornamented with
a bird with long green feathers.
Her physician advised her against sub
mitting to a long deposition, and the mat
ter, so far as she was concerned,, was
carried over until Monday. She had come
with the expectation of hearing the depo
sition of the Fair sisters, and was much
disappointed that they had gone without
testifying.
So the early morning scene dissolved.
In the afternoon, be.ore Notary Latham,
there was another scene. The deposition
of Richard V. Dey was taken.' It was in
teresting chiefly for what it did not dis
close and for the questions which were left
unanswered. . .
Mr. Dey said he was 61 years of age. and
had known James G. Fair since 1861 or
1862.
"I was in his employ as private secre
tary during the years 1880 to 1882," he
said. "Prior and subsequent to that time
I was in the employ of Flood & O'Brien
and Mackay since 1887 protecting the
titles of mining claims. lam the trustee
of the children of Mr. Fair and have bsen
since August, 1884."
"Are you their trustee in the matter of a
certain instrument executed by them â
Charles L. Fair, Vircinia Fair and Teresa
A. Oelrichsâ about March, 1895?"
"I am, sir."
"Will you kindly produce it?"
"Under ; advice of counsel I decline to
produce it here. I will produce it in
court."
"What counsel do you refer to?"
"Messrs. Knight & Heggerty and Reuben
H. Lloyd." ; . .
"When did you employ them?"
"Messrs. Knieht and Heggerty about
two weeks ago, and I have consulted with
Mr. Lloyd from time to time during the
progress of this litigation. "'.%
'"When did they advise you in this mat
ter?"
"Mr. Heggerty advised me so about two
weeks ago. Mr. Lloyd did so this morn
ing." â¢
"They - advised you not to produce it at
the taking of your deposition this morn
ing?"
"Yes, sir."
"Where is that instrument now?"
"I have it in my possession."
'â¢Was it acknowledged before a notary ?"
"Yes, sir." . .
"Where was it written and acknowl
edged?"
"In the Nevada Block."
"During the time that you were Senator
Fair's secretary did you become familiar
with his had writing?" , â¢ Â«
"Yes, sir; I saw him write frequently
during a period of thirteen years and up
to within a year of his death."
"When did you first see the pencil will,
so called '-
. "On the 16th day of March; I was at
Reuben H. Lloyd's office at the time. . Mr.
Lloyd and myself were the only persons
present. I think the day was Sunday. I
have never seen it since."
"DM you, at that time, make an ex
amination of it for the purpose of deter
mining whether or not it was in Senator
Fair's handwriting?"
"I looked ac it for that purpose, yes,
sir, for a few moments; I have since ex
amined photographs of the document for
the same purpose;; such a photograph was
sent to me. I supposed it was from Mr.
Lloyd: I have examined it half a dozen
times.
j "When did you examine it?"
"Well, day before yesterday I examined
it on one point."
"On what point?"
"I decline to answer.",;
-"I is a perfectly proper question. I ask
you, categorically, on what point?"
i"I decline to answer." '
"Did . you express an opinion upon the
first inspection, of; the pencil will as to
whether or not it was the handwriting of
Senator Fair?" ; 6
"Yes, sir; I did."
"Did you, on the same day, express an
opinion to : any other person than Mr.
Lloyd?"
-"I did, sirâ to two or three persons. I
think Mr. Heggerty was there, j I don't
remember the others."
; "Did you ever express an opinion to any
of the children of Senator Fair?"
"I aid, I think to all three of them, with
in, a few days after I" first r saw it in the
hands of Mr. Lloyd. I expressed an opin
ion to Miss Margaret Craven, also, in New
York." .;: /
'â¢Did you â  express such opinion to Mr.
MurJcay?"
"We discussed the matter but whether
1 expressed, an opinion I do not remem
r*r '
"Wbfttwaa the opinion you expressed
when you first saw the will in Mr. Lloyd's
office."
"I decline to answer."
"Why?"
"Well, it would interfere with certain
business matters."
"What business matters?"
"Well, I have to look into certain mat
ters relating to these papers."
"How look into them?"
"Well," said the witness, desperately,
"I am expected to pass upon the validity
of them."
"What was the opinion you had at that
time?"
"That it looked very much like Senator
Fair's handwriting."
"Did you say so?"
"I said it looked liKe Senator Fair's
writing. I made use of some other ex
pressions, also."
"What other expressions?"
"I said if it was a forgery it was a very
clever one."
"What did you say about it to Miss
Craven in New York?"
At this point Charles Heggerty entered
and promptly objected to the question
and advised the witness not to answer.
"Are you the same Richard Dey who
stated to a reporter of The Call what ap
pears in the issue oi that paper of March
20,1895?" Here Mr. Delmas read as fol
lows lrom an interview with Mr. Dey t
The handwriting of the will is most assur
edly tnat of the late Mr. Fair, and I don't
hesitate to pronounce the will genuine in
every respect. I should tie familiar with Sena
tor Fair's handwriting if anybody is. 1 was
his secretary from, lei me see; anyway, it was
in the '60s, until 1884. I understood him
thoroughly. We consulted together, dined to
getner, traveled together. There is no doubt
in my mind but that the new document ex
presses the manner in which the late Senntor
wished to dispose of his estate, it was just
like him to write this new will; it was his way
of doing things. He allowed these executors
of the first document filed to think that they
had everything their own way and then he
went off and upset the whole matter by making
another will. Kothiiie could be more charac
teristic of the man.
Upon Mr. Heggerty's advice the witness
declined to answer.
"Did you have such an interview with a
reporter of The Call?"
Heggerty objeted unless the name of
the reporter was given, that he might
know to what he was expected to tesiify.
Delmas then went over the interview,
expression by expression, asking the wit
ness if he had said so and so, at each of
which the same advice was given and the
witness declined to answer.
Then Delmas went over the same
grounds, putting the questions direct as
whether the witness thought so and so as
expressed, and the witness under advice
still declined to answer them. This effce
taally stalled the progress of the deposi
tion and the notary wa3 advised to report
tiie matter to court.
"\Y. M. Pierson, of Pierson & Mitchell,
attorneys for the special administrators of
the Fair estate, was then called. He
stated the firm of Pierson & Mitchell, as
such attorneys, had in their possession
seven wills made by Senator Fair, count
ing the c*odicils. They were in their hands
as attorneys and they declined to produce
them. Mr. Mitchell made the same state
menu
Mr. Crothers of the special adminis
trators and trustees under the will was
then sworn and stated that the wills were
not and never had been in his possession.
They had been delivered to Mr. Bresse as
an individual and he had turned them
over to their attorney.
This closed the inquiry of the day.
TUITION WILL BE FREE.

ing Educational Department of the
Y. M. C. A. Will Open Soon.

GRASS AT COOKS INLET.
Enormous Areas of Wild Red
top on the Kenik and Eeni
Rivers.
A Country as Good for Sheep and
Cattle Raising as the State of
Montana.
â F. E. Bowers of TuJare, who has spent
[five months in bunting for gold in the
country about Turnagain Arm, Cooks
Inlet, is at the Brooklyn. He has re
turned bronzed, with a long beard and
wit little gold, yet he thinks well of the
country for some purposes.
Even as a gold country he is not ready
to discount it, for though he was not suc
cessful he saw many who were. It is as a
grass and livestock country, however, that
he particularly commends it. /
"I call it as good a country as Mon
tana," said he, "and as things are now it
is the greatest gra3s country I know of.
There are thousands and thousands of
acres of magnificent grass all over the re
gion where I have been this summer.
"Take it on the Keni, Kenik and Sushit
na rivers, and stretching away for miles
and miles are waving meadows of the fin
est redtop you ever saw. Everybody
knows what red 'op is. Well, there you
have it in profusion. The grass is thick
and as fine as any that ever grew, and is
as tall as your head.
"It is a grass with fine nutritious blades.
Eaten green it makes magnificent beef
and mutton, and cut and fed as hay it
makes livestock . rolling fat. One thing
about the valleys of these rivers, too, is
that you can run a mowing machine. all
over them.' There are no hummocks to
obstruct the cutter-bar of the machine.
â¢ "But livestock up there don't need much
I hay. It Is no worse climate than Mod
tana, where cattle roam about substan
tially each winter without hay, and where
tney depend nearly, entirely on the dry
.wild grass. In the future that region is
destined to become a great cattle country.
' "I suppose, however, KadiaK Island will
become the center ot the cattle and sheep
growing. interests. When we came down
there the* cattle, horses and such other
stock as they had , were hog fat â all off
the grass that grew all around tliere.
This island is about ninety miles wide by
150 long., 3
"That country is great for sheep. .' Some
day Alaska will be known as the best
livestock country we have."^^^^^^___
NEW TRIAL GRANTED.
A Convicted Forger From New York Is
Given a Chance to Clear Himaelf,
The Supreme Court yesterday granted a
new trial to Alonzo J. Whiteman, the
man from New York recently convicted of
passing a forged check on the Bank of
California. During the trial several forged
checks were introduced in evidence to
prove tbat Whiteman was a swindler and
a forger. It was not, however, specifically
proved that the papers introduced were
forgeries, nor tnat the defendant had
passed them.
In the judgment of the Supreme Court
tne admission of these checks was an
injustice to the defendant. In conse
quence a new trial was granted as re
quested.
Mr. Bunnerruitn's Remarks.
Thomas R. Bannerman says that what he
really said at the meeting at K. K. B. Hall
Friday nignt was as follows: "1 feel that I
owe an apology for abandoning even for a
time the principles of my earlier manhood in
order to take any active part with the Parlia
mentary agitators wno are making the cause
of Ireland a by-word among the nations." The
F. E. BOWERS, "Who Tells of the Enormous Wild Meadows on
the Kenik, Keni and Other Rivers.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.}
principles to which he referred are the princi
ples for which Washington fought, and for
which Emmet gave up his life. Mr. Banner
man says that a portion of his remarks appears
to have been m'sunderstood, and this corrects
that misunderstanding.
NEW CHINESE PROBLEM
Collector Wise Confronted With a Novel
Point Concerning a Certificate
of Residence.
Collector Wise has been confronted with
a very novel point in the matter of Chi
nese registration. Some months ago one
Chow Yung of Butte, Mont., informed the
Collector that he intended to visit his
native land, and desiring to return to the
country of his adoption requested a cer
tificate of residence. Before the case could
be fully investigated Yung saileu for his
native heath, leaving his certificate, which
had been passed upon favorably. Now,
however, the Celestial desires to return to
this country and has requested that the
proper papers be delivered to nim. These,
it seems, have been destroyed, and ihe
Collector refuses to issue duplicates on
the ground that the Mongol forfeited his
right to return to America when he sailed
away without the originals. "Jung is ex
pected on tiie next steamer and will, of
course, be refused a landing. If he should
appeal from Mr. Wise's decision the out
come will be looked forward to with some
t
interest, as it is the h'rst case of the kind
on record. .
KITES IN THE CLOUDS.
Weather Prophet Haminon Unfortunate
In His Experiments.
Weather Prophet Hammon bad hard
lack with his Kite-fiyinK yesterday. The
threatening aspect of the weather and the
high wind that prevailed on the surface of
the earth and at an elevation, as indicated
by the movements of the clouds, caused
the forecaster to desire to send his kites
aloft for further information as to atmos
pheric conditions, wind, velocity, etc.
From the top of the'Milis building he
sent up four large kites, tandem, on a fine
piano wire. The highest attained an ele
vation of 4500 feet and 33 degrees, while
over 7500 feet of wire was let out The
upper atmosphere was so charged with
electricity that the attendants were
obliged to ground the kite wire on a
watHr-pipe. W en the time arrived for
taking in the kites the effort proved disas
trous, for all broke away, ;ifter entangling
the lines on chimneys and flagpoles, and
only two were recovered.
Death of an Unknown Man.
The unknown man who tell down the Â«tept
of a cellar saloon, corner Kenruy and Sacra
mento streets, and fractured his skull, died Â«t
the Receiving Hospitnl yesterday. The body
was removed to the Morgue, where as inqueit
will be held on Monday.
WAR ON DISEASE GERMS.
Sanitary Reduction Works Filed
Articles of Incorporation
Wednesday.
Crematory and Other Necessary Ap
paratus to Be Erected in a
Short Time.
The articles of incorporation of the Sani
tary Redaction Works of San Francisco
have been filed. The purpose for
which it was formed is to do all imposed
in F. E. Sba.on as grantee of an order
passed by the Supervisors February 17,
1898, by which he was given the sole privi
lege to cremate garbage, house refuse,
dead animals and other effete matter; to
dispose of tno same; to acquire and sell
real estate; to own and erect crematories
and reduction works; to manufacture and
se)l grease, fat, glue, fertilizers, glass,
brick, bone meal and bone charcoal; to
deal in hides, pelts and hair, and generally
to conduct a mercantile business in con
nection with crematories and reduction
works.
The articles of incorporat ion ' specify
tbat the place of business shall be in the
City and County of San Francisco and
that the corporation snail have an exist
ence of fifty years.
The nine directors for tbe first year are
as follows: F. E. Sharon, ex-Mayor El
lert, Henry H. Lynch, superintendent of
construction of the Market-street Ca
ble Company; J. O'Brien Gunn, secretary
of the Union Iron Works; Henry Wads
worth, cashier of Wells, Fargo & Co.'s
bank : Andrea Sbarboro, president of the
Italian Swiss Colony ; Dr. Joseph Pescia,
ex-Supervisor and Italian Consul; Paul
Barbie ri and Pietro C. Rossi.
The amount of capital subscribed is
$1,000,000, divided into 100,000 shares at j
$10 each. The amount actually subscribed j
is 450 snares, each director subscribing 1
five. Only a limited amount of stock will i
be placed on the market, as the incorpur- '
ators will keep the rest.
The company will erect a crematory at
once, and in a very short time will put up I
extensive reduction works, the site of
which will probably be in the vicinity of
the present dumps. Eliert has been elected
president and general manager of the
company, and will go East immediately !
to inspect the works in other cities. Sbar
boro i. as been elected secretary.
Under the Sharon franchise this City i
will receive about $7000 a year, or $350 000
for the term of the franchise. This is cal
culated on the present population. Any
way, the financial and sanitary benefit
will be extensive.
As the garbage increases the income of
the City will grow larger, as it gets a nxed
percentage of tbe gross income of the com
pany. The present dumps, it is a notori-
I ous fact, have been a diserace for years
breeding microbes and every sort of disl
ease perms. All the bad smells an-in*
from them will be done away with, it is
confidently expected, as soon as the
crematories are finished.

The Prescription of a Great Remedy
WHICH CURED HIM AFTER EVERY-
THING ELSIi FAILED.
' Painful diseases are bad enough, bat when a
man Is slowly wasting away with nervous weak-
ness, the mental forebodings are ten times worse
than the most severe pain. There is no let up to
the mental suffering day or night. Sleep is almost
impossible, and under such a strain men are
scarcely responsible for what they da For years
the writer rolled and tossed on the troubled sea of
sexual weakness until it was a question whether
he had not better take a dose of poison and thus
end all his troub eg. But provisional Inspiration
came to his aid In the shape of a combination of
medicines that not only completely restored his
general health, but enlarged tils weak, emaciated
parts to natural site and vigor, and he now de-
clares that any man who will take the trouble to
send his name and ; address may have the pre-
scription of this wonderful remedy free. Now
when I say free I mean absolutely without cost,
because I want every weakened man to get the
beuefit of my experience.
I am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as an
enthusiast, but there are nousands of men stiff

how I can afford to pay the few postage stamps
