To Hon. William McKinley, President-
Klect of thtj United States, Canton,
Ohio:
The woolmen of California send their
congratulations.
JACOB ROSKXBKKG,
President of the Association.
F. S. MOODY, Secretary.
The ereat mass of Democrats, as well os
Republicans, on the Pacific Coast, now
that the excitement of the campaign is
over, desire to know something about the
personality of the man who on March 4,
1897, will assume the responsibility of the
office of President of the United States,
his term completing the nineteenth cen
tury ana beginning the twentieth.
IJow the President-elect appears to a
stranger was graphically told in a pen
picture by John Paul Coscrave, who, un
der instructions from The Call, visited
Major McKiniey at his home in Canton,
Ohio, two days after the nomination by
tbe St. Louis convention. Part of the
â  article referred to is here republished:
CANTON", Ohio, June 20.â 1 had ample
opportunity this morning to draw a
mental portrait of Governor McKinley as
he stood in the parlor of his cozy and un
ostentations residence surrounded by a
eroi;u of New York delegates. I found
him a tquare-shouldered, square-headed
man, rather short than tall of stature and
â  inclined to corpulency. His hands were
in his panta'oons' pockets and his feet
wide apart, giving him a solid foundation.
â .it- is aUkmle is ia harmony with the
rest oi his physical make-upâ strong, pur
poseful, reliant.
Standing in this position with shoulders
set well back and chest tnrown forward
the hereditary determination of his
Scotct.-Irish ancestors stands revealed.
The square forward chin, the square jaw,
the lines extending downward from the
corners of the mouth, the deep-set lines
from the corners of the nostrils, the
. dimple of babyhood grown into the cleft
in the chin, tlie lips horizontally set and
the almost level eyebrows tell the same
story.
The most conspicuous facial character
istic of this man upon whom the eyes of
tbe Nation are blazing to-day is the aqui
line profile. It reminds you at once of
an eagle's head. There are the curved
beak of the King of the cliff and the crag,
the iine-grained, daik and rather scanty
hair brushed back over the ears, and the
downward curve of the mouth to make
the resemblance more vivid. Like most
of the other dwellers in the moist heat of
the great West, and like the Bonaparte
whom he resembles, there is no color in
the McKinley face, and this absence of
red, which is often an indication of a tem
perate life, is made more conspicuous by
the dark hair and eyebrows and the suit
of solemn black cloth and the black tie
which he wear?.
The Republican candidate for the Presi
dency of the United States has a remarka
ble pair of eyes. They are gray and

deeply set behind black and somewhat
shaggy brows. Indeed they are set so
deeply tbat there does not seem to be
anj* eyelid above them, and most of the
time they are shaded. The dark-brown
hue of the upper strip ot the lower eyelid
adds to these a Kenibrandt chiaroscuro
effect

round bright gray eyes shine at you. The
look is not keen and penetrating nor de
livered from ambnsh, but open, bold and
sparkling. There is no winking of the
dark eyelashes, but the round pupils shine
as polished crystal. They are among the
frankest eyes I ever looked into.
Once while I was clandestinely study
ing this remarkable man, to whom tbe
signs of the times are pointing as the next
President, he left the group of New York
ers and walked to the back parlor. Hie
step was the stride of an Edwin Booth;
every sweep of the body showed intellec
tual as well as physical power; there was
a free and gracefui swinging of the arms,
a swaying of the compact, rounded figure
and a dipping of each shoulder in unison
with the step.
From an iron man, snch as Governor
McKinley strikes me as being, you would
expect a rough, deep bass voice. But such
is not the case. The Governor's voice is
clear and musical, modulation and accent
being those of a well-trained elocutionist
While possessing all the courtesy and
chivalric bearing of the Latin race, the
Governor has an ampie store of Scotch
cautiousness which is the saving rudder
to his force of character. This quality
came to the front this morning, when one
of the New Yorkers laid before him on a
table a small liag, on whose white stripes
were printed with pen and ink the name
of a Republican club of that city with the
request that the Governor should sign his
autograph on the white stripe below the
inscription. The Governor mechanically
dipped his pen in ink and held the pen
poised above the flag.
"I will not write upon the stars and
stripes," he said quietly, but with a deci
j sion from which there could be unmU
j takably no appeal. That expression will
go down in history, although it sounded
commonplace there among the common
place people, who failed to take in its full
significanceâ the patriotism of the re
! mark.
"No," said one of the prosaic lawyers
from Manhattan, "it's a misdemeanor."
"That's so," remarked the man who bad
disfigured his couniry's flag with bad let
tering. "Write your autograph ana your
name on a sheet of piper ana that will be
just aa good."
The Governor readily complied with the
request, and for ten minutes was busy
writing his autoeraph. When I asked
him for one for The Call he replied:
"1 will give my autograph to tbe San
Francisco. Call with pleaaure," and he
dashed off "Yours, truly, Wm. McKin
le^," in those bold, square characters, so
like the man himself, mentally and phy
sically.
In his speech on this occasion the Gov
ernor made the first political utterance
since his name was mentioned for the
Presidency. In a few simple words he
laid his finger upon the cause of thn
trials which now afflicted the working
people of this Nation when be said that
he was glad to have demonstrated in his
native town that tin plate could be made
in America. His next sentence was
greeted by a chorus of cheers:
â¢When I have given the American
workingman a day's wages and a day's
work I will be satisfied.
The Governor received me very cor
dially, but in reply to my request for a
statement from him on his conception of
public policy designed to secure the great
est happiness to the greatest number of
the inhabitants of this country he said
that while he would be pleased to favor
the San Francisco Call in every way tie
could it would be impossible lor him to 7
make any statements at this time for pub
lication, for the reason that he might be
misunderstood.
"I have declined to state anything of
that kind to Murat Halstead, John Rus
sell Young and a score or more of other
newspaper correspondents from the^HH
great dailies of this country, because my
friends have advised me that it would not
be politic at this time or discreet to say
anything of these matters. The commit
tee appointed to formally notify me of mv
nomination will call upon me in about
ten days, and whatever I may have to say
on those matters will be given to the pub
lic on that occasion."
At this moment Mrs. McKinley entered
the room. She has been for twenty-three
years a confirmed invalid and cannot
walk without the aid of a cane orother
support. She is a highly accomplished
lady, of most fascinating manner and of a
cheer. ul disposition. It has been a com
mon remark among those who have known
this couple for more than a score of years
that into the sunshine of their wedded
lives there never has come a cloud. Gov
ernor McKinley is a devoted husband. Of
him can no man dare to say auiÂ»ht that he
would fear to have published to the world.
His private life is witiiout a stain; with
out even a suspicion of blemish.
Yet upon their happy wedded lives the
whirling wheel of fate has brought much

Remainder of the Century.
sorrow. Across their lives misfortune
swept and tracked their hearts with deso
lation.
Two children blessed them ; no brighter
in mind, no lovelier in face and form, no
more beloved by God, indeed, than those
the poorest laborer holds close against his
breast when twilight ends his day of toil.
Their hearts' best love went out to those
sweet giits of God, and prattling music
filled that humble home. But angels
came unbidden and unseen and stilled the
vibrant chords, and plucked the rosebuds
one by one, to weave them in the crown
of him who smiled when little children
played about the feet of God. And on a
gentle rise a mile or two from home there
is a spot on which the passing clouds cast
shadows; two little mounds, kept green
by summer suns and summer showers, the
crass as fresh and as bright as once were
they who lie beneath locked up in earth.
This man and woman, joined as closely
as holy love could weld them, have
learned, through bitter pain, that smiies
and tears ana life and death are inter
woven in the lives of all God's creatures.
So these twoâ this kind and Christian
man; this gentle, patient, suffering woman
â have not escaped the common lot of all,
and sorrow's link has bound them to the
lowliest of their neighbors. And so,
among the grassy slopes where the little
mounds are shaded 'neath the maples,
this man's and woman's feet on many a
hoiy pilgrimage have worn a pathway to
their loved and lost.
Death can take away all else but love.
The memory of her own lost darlings has
bent the mother's steps to deeds of golden
light. Many a home in Canton has been
blessed by the sunshine of her smile, the
benelicent giving of her hands. The
children of the poor have been her special
care, A score of years has not latigued
her nimble ringers, and in that time
there's many a baby's foot been warmea
with web and warp and woof of cotton
and of wool by this sweet lady who will
grace the White House.
The record of William McKinley is one
of which the foremost citizens in any State
or any country might well be proud. His
loyalty has not been confined to tongue
utterance; it has been expressed in deeds
upon the field of battle; It ha 3 been
breathed forth in the stifling smoke of
gunpowder, nor has it been deafened by
the roar of cannon.
Mr. McKinley was born in Niles, Ohio,
January 29, 1843, about fifty miles east of
Canton, just north of the Western Reserve
line. His father was an ironmaster there,
and had moved from New Lisbon, Ohio, to
the town of Poland, near Niles, so that his
children might be educated at the Poiand
academy. In his college days at Poland
McKinley was the prize debater.
Wuen the War of the Rebellion broke
oat young AlcKiniey's pulse was stirred
with patriotism, and in June, 1861, he
joined the ranks of tbe Union army at
the age of 18. He enlisted in the Twenty
third Regiment of Ohio Volunteers, which
was organised at Columbus. Its first
colonel was William S. Rosecrans, after
ward major-genera!. Its lieutenant-colonel
was Stanley Matiiews, who became United
States Senator and Justice of the Supreme
Court. Its major was Rutherford B.
Hayes, altarward President, of the United
States; and last, but not least of all, in
Mrs, William McKinley Sr., Who Lives Near Her Favorite Son.
the words of an old comrade, "there
marched in the ranks of Company E, with
a fat knapsack on his back and a heavy
musket on his shoulder, in a new suit of
blue, footed in brogans, the leatner of
which resembled cast iron, the boy of 18,
William McKinley, who was serving his
apprenticeship as one of the Presidents of
the United States."
The first battle in which Private Mc-
Kinley, a stout lad at that time, was en
caged was when Rosecrans defeated Floyd
at Carnifex Ferry. Afterward McKinley's
regiment fought under McClellan of the
Army of the Potomac. He amelled pow
der at Antietam and South Mountain, and
after the battle of Antietam he was pro
moted from the rank of private to that of
second lieutenant, on account of soldierly
bearing and brave conduct in those en
gagements.
The only step between his rank as high
private and that of second lieutenant was
that of commissary sergeant. He never
til a corporal, although lie is little,
and he does not take kindly to- bis re
ported resemblance to the first Napoleon,
"the Littie Corporal." He was afterward
piomoted a first lieutenant and captain,
and served on the brigade and division
staff of General It. B. Hayes part of the
I time; later as aid-de-camp. He also was

staff of General George Crook and with
Sheridan in the Sbenandoah Valley cam
paign. He faced the battle clouds from
which rained hissing lead at Cedar Creek,
at Winchester, at Fis'.iers Hill, at Ope
quam and on other fields at that period.
On- that historic day when the gallant
Phil Sheridan rode his foaming horse
from Winchester young Major McKinley
was rallying the troops at Cedar Creek,
and Sheridan speaks of it with pride in his
memoirs. â¢
At Berryville Major McKinley's horse
was shot from under him. He holds a
commission of brevet-major in the United
States Volunteers, issued in 1864, for gal
lant and meritorious services at Opequam,
Cedar Creek and Fishers Hill. This com
mission was issued by Abraham Lincoln.
Major McKinley accompanied General
Crook to Cumberland, iv Maryland, where,
after the capture of Crook and General
Kelley, General Hancock retained Major
McKinley on his staff until the brave
young soldier was assigned to the staff of
General Samuel S. Carroll, commanding
the veteran reserve corps at Washington.
The future President of the United States
looked on with tear-filled eyes and bosom
swelling with loyalty and pride when
Grant received the sword of Lee at Ap
pomattox. Not until the end of the war,
September, 1865, did young McKinley lay
aside his sword.
Art connoisseurs will not approve of the
laste of Governor McKinley in the selec
tion of pictures with which to adorn the
walls of his Canton home. Instead of

from the lite of General Ulysses S. Grant,
a large steel engraving representing the
surrender of Lee to Grant ai Appomattox,
a tine engraving of Abraham Lincoln, and
other subjects of a like kind, which prove
that Governor McKinley's loyalty and pa
triotism are foremost in his thoughts. *Â»â¢

CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 7.â This has been
a lively Saturday for Major McKinley.
He has rsceived half a dozen smail dele
gations and one large one, talked with a
hundred people and shaken hands with a
thousand; but made no speeches. The
day closed with a jollification. Illumina
tion was general along' the lines of march
and the parade was reviewed by Major
McKinley as it passed his house. Five
thousand people from Alliance, Massillon,
Cieveland and other cities in the northern
part of Ohio participated.
Major McKinley decided this evening to
remain in Canton till Thursday next. He
came to this decision at the suggestion of
Mrs. McKinley's physician, who said
that it would not be advisable for her to
travel before the middle of the week. The
big delegation of the day was composed of
the employes of the New Philadelphia
Iron and Steel Company of New Philadel
phia, Ohio. The men called at the Mc-
Kinley residence at 3 o'clock this after
noon. There were 600 men in the p.irty,
and many of them brought along their
wives. Major McKiniey thanked his vis
itors for their call and shook each by the
hand.
Upward of a hundred letters congratu
lating Major McKinley upon his patriotic
utterances in his recent telegram to Mr.
Hanna have been received to-day. About
one-half of these messages were from the
South.
The following letters of congratulation
were received:
Daniel Hastings, Governor of Pennsyl
vania, Harnsburg â The most satisfac
tory tiling about your campaign is that
you made not a single mistake. You met
every question fairly, bravely and most
ably. There seemed to have been a di
vine hand cuiding your every footstep.
Washington Hesing, Postmaster of Chi
chagoâNever was the country brought
face to face with a greater crisis and never
did the American people in their superior
commvn Eeuse when wild unreasoning
had fled rise more courageously to the
emergency of the hour than they did last
Tuesday.
Hon. John Wanamaker, ex-Postmaster-
General, Philadelphia â I hoped and
worfced for a larger majority, but the win
ning is enough. Now for the hardeT work
of shaping the administration. It is a
Herculean task, but you will have the
best wishes and help of a host of friends.
I count myself one.
Andrew Carnegie â No man has watched
the contest with deeper anxiety than I.
No one is more deeply grateful for the re
sult. Everything favors prosperity to
day. We have ordered the completion of
new works and gone ahead in all our de
ierred improvements.
Lieutenant-Governor Saxton of New
York â I am proud as an American citizen
of the grand record you made during the
canvass that has just ended. Before it
began you stood very high in the popular
esteem, but during the past few months
you have won to an extraordinary degree
the affection and admiration of all patri
otic Americans.
Joseph Jefferson, Pittsfield, Mass.â l
congratulate you upon your splendid vic
tory. lam a trifle late, but none the less
sincere. Here's to your health and your
family ; may they all live long and pros
per.
Kills Gron, Union League Club, New
"Yorkâ Ninety per cent of the 600,000
Scandinavian-American voters cast their
ballots for you, and will always be proud
of it. Accept my personal congratula
tions.
Other congratulatory letters came from
Charles Foster, ex-Secretary of the Treas
ury, Fostoria, Ohio; Hon. William T.
Durbin, Indiana, and others.
KENTUCKY IS ALL RIGHT.
Republican for the First Time In a
Presidential Election.
LOUISVILLE, Kt., Nov. 7.â McKinley
has certainly got twelve of Kentucky's
thirteen electoral votes. The official
count by the county canvassing boards
was completed this afternoon, but the re-
turns are slow in coming in, and at this
hourâ 9 o'clockâ it is impossible to give
the total vote with any degree of accu
racy. The totals of the official count in
thisâ Jeffersonâ county have not been an
nounced, but McKinley gained about 150
votes on his plurality of 12,311. .The last
edition of the Evening Times estimates
McKinley's plurality at 648. The Post's
estimate is over 100.- - â -
The official count in most every county
heard from shows that Kast, the first Re
publican, and Smith, the first Democratic
elector, lead their tickets by from fifty to
100 votes, and this - insures '- Bryan one
elector.
â¢ Up to 9 o'clock it was impossible to se
cure a statement from. Democratic head
quarters. The rooms were dark and the
hotel clerk at the 'Willard- said National
Committeeman Woodson had gone home.

mittee, could not be found. "--â¢',

among other things: "The Democrats will go

This bu.letin was based upon actual unoffi

to-day, in spite of errors of newspaper corres

COLD MEN CONTROL.
They Will Have a Majority In the
Next Congress.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 7.-The an-
nouncement from Milwaukee by friends of
Senator John L. Mitchell of Wisconsin
that he will support gold measures in the^
Senate makes a tie of the gold and silver
forces in that body and puts upon Vice-
President Hobart the responsibility of
casting the deciding vote. This, of course,
took the assumption that no other changes
are inaae. Putt nc; him among the gold
men, the Senate In the next Congress, as
at present indicated, will be divided
among the parties as follows: Gold Re
publican, 37; : old Democrats, 8; total,
45. Silver Democrats, 25; silver Republi
cans, 10; Populists, 9; total, 45.
Should Messrs. Carter of Montana and
Shoup of Idaho, who supported Major
McKinley in the campaign, ally them
s.'lves with the dominant faction of tha
party, the gold vote in the Senate after
March 4 next wouid be 47 and the silver
vote 43.
The composition of the House of Repre
sentatives in the Fifty-fiftu Congress re
mains substantially the same as at first
sent out by the United Associated Presses,
the political division, according to the
latest returns, being as follows: Repub
licans, 212; sound-money Democrats, 2;
Democrats, 120; silver Republicans, Popu
lists and fusionists, 23.
THEIR CAUSE EXTOLLED.
Silver Men Asked to Pluck Up
Courage In lowa.
DES AIOINES, lowa, Nov. 7.â The State
Central Committees of the threa silver
parties in lowa, Democratic, silver Re
publican and Popuiists, to-day issued an
address to their followers. It ia over the
signatures of Chairman Curry and Secre
tary Carr of the Democrats, Chairman
Beliangee and Secretary Meredith of the
Populists and Chairman Cliff and Secre
tary Wilson of the silver Republicans. It
declares that while silver has been Dealen
in lowa it polled for Bryan 225,000 votes, a
larger number by 5000 than the largest
vote ever polled by the Republicans in a
previous year. The silver men are ex
norted to take courage and confidence in
the future. Their cause is extolled aa just
and therefore sure to win.
The addiess concludes with the sugges
tion that the silver parties should be more
closely united. The proposal is that they
give up their separate organizations and
effect a single one, wit.i one State Com
mittee instead of three. To thin end a
conference oi all the committe-s will be
held here in the near future. The Demo
crats claim to bava cast about 165,000 vot-s
this year, the silver Republicans 30,000
and the Populists 30,000. all for Bryan.
Against this the Republicans cast 287,000
lor McKinley. There is little doubt the
consolidation will be effected, as the mid
dle-of-the-road Populist sentiment is al
most completely eradicated in the State.
FOR A CABINET POSITION.
Hon. Nathan Fr
ank Put Forward
by His Friends.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.. Nov. 7. -Considerable
interest is manifested in this city as to the
formation of Mr. McKinley's Cabinet, and
with the desire that St. Louis and the
Southwest be represented a number of
leading Republicans, together with several
prominent sound-money Democrats, have
urj;ed Hon. Nathan Frank to be presented
as their choice for a Cabinet position. His
friends declare he is well qualified for the
portfolio of Attorney -General or Secretary
of the Interior.
To a reporter from the United Associ
ated Presses to-day Mr. Frank acknowl
edged that the matter had been sug
gested to him, but said that the question
was of too delicate a character to discuss
at the | resent time.
IF REVENUES FAIL.
Then It Will Be Time Enough to
Summon Congress.
DETROIT, Mien., No*. 7.â Senator Mc-
Millau in an interview to-day in regard to
McKinley calling an extra session of Con
gress after his inauguration as President
said: "The less Congress is in session the
better. It is impossible at this time to
judge as to the probabilities of a special
session. We want to show how the Wil
son bill will operate under the new order
of things. It depends upon importations.
If the receipts of revenues should be suffi
cient to meet tbe expenses of the Govern
ment I doubt whether a special session
would be called. If, however, they should
prove insufficient prompt measures would
I suppose be demanded. Republican ac
tion on tariff revision is in the future a
subject for consultation with tbe sound
money Democrats â a subject for consulta

GUESTS OF MR. HANNA.
Newspaper Men Banqueted and
Presented With Medals.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. B.â Mark A.
Hanna uave a dinner to-night in the Ho
tel Waldorf to newspaper men of New
York and Chicago who had been employed
at headquarters in both cities chronicling
events in one of the most exciting politi
cal struggles in the history of the country.
Not only did he give them a dinner, and a
good one, but he also presented each re
porter and correspondent with a medal of
the size and value of a $20 gold piece, and
of absolute purity, in slight token, as he
expressed it, of the National Republican
Committee's appreciation of the ability
and conscientiousness with which they
performed their duties.
There was no discrimination of party
in the presentation. Reporters for the
silver and for the gold papers were treated
alike, and the name of each recipient was
encraved on the face of the medal. The
medal was surmounted by a golden eagle
with outstretched wings, on which wore
inscribed: "McKinley and Hobart â Sound
Money and Protection." |
Cornelius N. Biiss, treasurer of the Na
tional Republican Committee, was also
present. He sat at one side of the festive
board, Mr. Hanna sat at the other. Colonel
Perry Heath, chief of the campaign press
bureau of Chicago, presided, and Jules
Guthridge, who held the same position in
this city, was vice-chairman.
After the menu had been discussed and
the guests begun to seek solace in coffee
and Cigars, Colonel Heath of Chicago pro
posed the health of the host, Mark A.
Hanna. which was drunk amid cheers.
Mr. Hanna, in briefly responding, said:
Since the campaign enaed I have begun to
redeem my reputation. To say that I am en
joying this evening would be but mildly ex
pressing the pleasure of seeing these familiar
faces around me. AYhen I began this cam
paign I felt that I should be safe if I had the
Iriendshlp of the newspaper men. I began to
diagnpse the situation, and uovr that the cam
paign has been brought to a successful end I
don't mind telling you that I pickel up a
great many pointers from you. I found that
every one of you was just as fully alive to the
situation as 1 was. Nobody understands bet
ter than I do in my position how important it
is to be solid with the newspaper men. Thuy
gave me fresh inspiration every day during
the campaign. They came to me fresh from
the people whom they had seen, and I must
say 1 got as much information Iroin them as
they did from me. I know they have done
their share toward writing the history of the
campaign and I am glad that I am in it with
them.
The chairman, Colonel Heath, then pro
posed the health of Charles A. Dana, and
James Olmstead of the New York Sun
staff briefly responded.
There were caiis for Colonel Heath.
Mr. Hanna then arosa and said that it
was Mr. Heath who first suggested the
idea of "flag day" and that he had simply
acted on Colonel Heath's suggestion in
adopting it.
Many witty speeches were made and the
conversation after dinner was brilliant.
No one enjoyed it more than Mr. Hanna,
who swung around on his pivotal chair to
hear the salient points.
T c t,'ue?ts at ihe dinner were twenty
New York aud Brooklyn uewspapermeu
from as many papers and the following
from Chicago: W. C. Gregory, tbe Tri
tfune; Stunner M. Curtis, the Times-
Herald; Hiram D. Fargo, the Evening

HONORS FOR BLISS.
May Ba Asked to Accept the Treas-
ury Portfolio.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 7.âRepubli
can loc.il leaders say that it seems to be
practically settled that Cornelius N. Bliss
will be President McKinley's Secretary of
the Treasury. It is understood that the
President-elect has expressed a desire that
Mr. Bliss accept the treasury portfolio,
and is anxious that his selection shall
have the approval of the Republican or
ganization in this State.
The selection of Mr. Bliss for this place,
it was said y esterday, will not be disap
pointing or even unsatisfactory to local
Republican organizations. In his capacity
as treasurer of the National Committee
Mr. Bliss had to meet the local leaders
frequently, and friendly relations were
established. So certain is one Republican
of National prominence that Mr. Bliss is
to be the next Secretary of the Treasury
that i c said at the Fifth-avenue Hotel
yesterday that he had positive informa
tion thai the appointment had been ten
dered and accepted.
Cornelius N. Bliss is in the wholesale
dry iroods business and is interested as a
stockholder and director in several banks
and trust companies. For eight years ha
has been the treasurer of the Republican
National Committee.
There is a provision in the United
States Revised Statutes which might
cause him to give up some ot his present
business enterprises should he accept the
place of Secretary of the Treasury. Mr.
Bliss 1 dry goods business is said to be in
domestic fabrics eutirely and he might
not through that come within the inhibi
tion of the statutes. His relations with
financial institutions which deal in Gov
ernment securities, however, might need
to be severed.
FOR McKINLEY'S CABINET.
Statesmen Who May Be Honored
With Portfolios.
WHEELING, W. Va., Nov. 7.â The fol
lowing concerning McKinley's Cabinet
will be printed in the News (Ind.) to
morrow: In this State the South is given
recognition by the award of two places,
while the sound-money Democrats are
given one.
It is stated that Cornelius N. Biiss of
New York will not be the Secretary of the
Treasury, as has been announce!, because
the position involves duties too onerous,
which he would not be willing to under
take. Mr. Biiss, on the other hand, can
be Secretary of the Navy, if he is willing
to take it. John Snerrnan, it is stated,
will be Secretary of State, if he will take
the job.
While Sherman's chief fame lies in his
ability as a financier, yet bis work on the
Foreign Relations Committee of the
Senate has given him reputation as a dip
lomat quite as valuable as that of finan
cier.
As to the Treasury, Henry C. Payne of
Wisconsin, one of Hanna's conn ential
advisers, has tljÂ« call. Payne is absolutly
par excellence, and it is said wduia make
a splendid man for tbÂ« plac?.
Tbe Attorney-Generalship will be the
place offered to the sound-money Demo
crats. Almost every utterance coming
from Major McKiniey since his election
has contained some kind words for the
sound-money Democrats Who aided in his
election, and has further emphasized the
idea that his victory was not a partisan
one.
It is now said that ex-Congressman Wil
liam D. Bynuru of Indiana will be offered
the portfolio now held oy Harmon.
General Russell A. Alger of Michigan,
who headed the, campaigning generals on
their triumphant tour of the South for
McKinley, is set down for the portfolio of
War.
Alger has been a leader for years, and
recognition of his services would be appre
ciated. Governor William O'ConneH
Bradley of Kentucky is said to have the
call for the interior, although according to
some people here another man has been
selected, but it is stated that Bradley will
be the appointee.
Colonel Nathan N. Scott of this town
is set down as Postmnster-General. Wil
liam L. Wilson, a West Virginian, now
holds the place and it is considered that in
view of the State going Republican and
also in consideration of Colonel Scott's
services that he will be tendered the port
folio.
Colonel Scott said to-day that he did
not aspire to any position, but he did not
say that he would not accept one if
offered to him. The Secretaryship of
Agriculture has not been placed. It will
likely go to some good Western man like
Thurstou, who has been most active in
McKinley's campaign.
Settle to Slake a Contest.
WINSTON, N. C, Nov. 7.â lt is stated
that Congressman Settle (R.) of the Fifth
District has decided to contest the elec
tion of W. W. Kitchen (D.). The returns
give tne latter a majority of over 400.
Settle claims that t' ere were irregularities
in Rockingham County.
TINAN'S ARKEbT IN FRANCE.
A Put-Up Job Between the English and
trench ' Authorities.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 7.â A London
dispatch says: According to a police offi
cial high in the councils of Scotland Yard,
pnd who has been talking, to some of his
friends without the slightest idea that his
confidences would get into print, the ar
rest of Tynan in France was simply a put
up job between the English and French
authorities for the purpose of making the
Czar feel , assured when on French soil
that all possible sources of danger to his
person were under surveillance. >
According to the officer in question, if
the English authorities had really. wanted
"No. 1," they could have captured him in
England, instead of in": France, inasmuch
as he had bought his tickets for London
on the day before bis arrest, a fact known
to the English detectives who were watch
ing his movements.'"
V But the English Government did not
want Tynan . in . London, and, says the
officer in question: "There was a tacit
understanding all along that the French
authorities should arrest him for the
Phoenix Park murders and the . Dclice
should keep him snug and quiet while the
Czar was about, and 'then spare - every
body 3 feeling* by refusing him extra
dition and sending him back to the happy
dumping-ground of patriots' who run the
murder: and dynamite business as a spec-"
ulation for profit. 'â '-. â¢/" â  s
; "The who business has been managed
with a goo.i deal of tact and make-believe,
but if the; full story could come out it
would cause ns much of , a sensation as
some of the alleged outrages themselves."
PRINCETON BEATS
HARVARD'S TEAM
Twenty Thousand People at
the Annual Football
Match.
The First Half Hotly Contested
Without Either Side
Scoring.
BUT HARVARD WAS WEAKENED
Princeton's Irresistible Rushes Quickly
Wia the Gam: in the Second
Half-12 to o.
BOSTON, Mass., Nov. 7.â Princeton de
feated Harvard on Soldiers' field this
*<ilternoon by a score of 12 to 0, the story
of the game being the record of a crippled
eleven fighting desperately but in vain
against opponents in good condition. The
day was perfect, there being little or no
wind. Attendance about 20,000.
In the first half neither side scored.
Princeton directed her mass plays against
Harvard's sub -tackles, and they held
their opponents nobly. Several times
Princeton had to relinquish the ball on
downs, and it was then kicked immedi
ately out of danger. The nearest Prince
ton came to scoring in this hair was when
she got down to HarvarJ's seven-yard
line, and was there held by a gallant rally
on Harvard's part. Harvard's policy in
the half seemed to be a defensive one
purely, and on this style of play Prince
ton's goal was never threatened except
once, when Brown attempted a goal from
the field from the thirty-yard line, and
that was a lamentable failure.
At the end of the first half the Harvard
men were jubilant, and they hoped that a
change of tactics from the defensive to
offensive might perhaps win a score. The
game was really decided about five min
utes after tho opening of the second half.
Harvard seemed so fagged out from the
efforts of her first half that she could not
put her offensive plays through. With
the ball on Harvard's yard line, Brewer
huving just replaced Cabot, Princeton di
rected the play at his end. By an irresist
ible rush tae whole Princeton eleven
seemed to go between Swain and Brewer
and down the held for a touchdown. It
was all done in a minute, and seemed to
paralye the whole Harvard eieven. Baird
easily kicked the goal.
Harvard then started in to retrieve her
self, but could not hold together. Several
brilliant gains were made, but for the
most part Princeton, already elated with
hopes of victory, t<>re up the slow inter
ference and lorced Brown to kick. Brown's
punting in the second half weakened per
ceptibly and Baird gained several yards
for Princeton on each interchange. TJiree
times Baird tried for goals from the field
(once from center on a place kick and
at two other.times from shorter distances),
but at no time came very near the goal.
The 1 outcome of the was definitely
settled about ieu minutes before the close.
Princeton by her long punts was gradually ,
forcing Harvard back to her goal line,
when Harvard secured the ball on her 10
-yard line. Brown was sent back to kick,
but Harvard's weakened tackles could n t
hold and Church broke through and
blocked the ball. It rolled back of the line
and R-.-iter fell on it for the second touch
down. Baird easily made the goal.
Time was finally called with the ball in
Princeton's possession on Harvard's 30
-yard line.
Although defeated, Harvard must be
given credit for her defensive points. Sev
eral times Princeton lost the ball on
downs, while Harvard did so but once,
although often forced to kick. A blocked
kick and a grand rush between tackle anl
end tells the story of Princeton's twelve
points, while a slow, weak interference and
a iack of aÃgress.ve offense explains Har
vard's inability to score.
Several changes were necessary in both
elevens, owing to injuries, most of which
were on the sine of Princeton, though
none were serious. The game was free from
objectionable features. The team lined
up as follows:

Quakers Scalp the < artiste Indians by
a Score of SI to O.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Nov. 7.â The
Pennsylvanias shook off the lethargy to
day that has paralyzed their football play
ing this season and took the scalp of the
Carlisle Indians by a score of 21 to 0.
After -Having been unable to gain
throughout the entire game and- having
been driven back upon their goal, the In
dians with ten minutes left to play secured
the ball on their forty-yard line. â 
By desperate rushes the Indians suc
ceeded in getting the ball two yards from
Pennsylvania's goal. ;It looked as if noth
ing could save a touchdown. ,â 
" Straight into the mass of men Metoxen,
the Indian fullback, plunged, and a wild
shout rent the air when the players were
pulled > off I each ; other, and Metoxen was
seen lying with the ball on, but not over,
the goal line. There was still two downs
and one inch to. gain. Not a sound arose
from the 15,000 people as the men lined
Â»up. With clenched teeth ayd fierce faces
'the Indians â¢ hurled I themselves against
their foes.' There was an awful crush and
swaying of fighting- men, and then tlie
human mass went down in a heap.
Again came that dead silence as the men
sullenly rolled off each other in response
to the referee's whistle. Then' a tri
umphant shout, arose from the white men,
for they had met ; the "onslaught" and
Metozen had again been stopped right on
the line.. One more chance remained. As
Metozeh dashed into the line the Quaker
rushers heaved forward" and threw the
entire Indian team back, and the touch
down v was y lost ': six ' inches. â  Then the
referee's whistle blew ana the game was
over. Pandemonium Droke loose, and the
students swarmed I over ; the ground and
nearly tore the Quakers' clothes off their
backs , in their endeavor, to 'congratulate
them. â  ; ; '^
- â ? WEST POINT, N. V., Nov. 7â The
football game f between i cadets * and the
VVesleyan - College this afternoon â  was a
hard and rough contest, v several, men on
both sides being ; injured. West Point
won the i toss-up and " in less than- one
minute Connor ran to f a touchdown, bat
failed at goal, < scoring : on t; four - points. .
After the next . line-up itomeyii, by - suc
cessive rashe?, scored another touchdown
for tne cadets, but Connor failed at goal.
Irr the next line-up, Wing, Wesleyan's
back, rushed tnrough the center and ran
to a touchdown, and, succeeding at goal,
scored six points for Wesleyan. Shortly
after the men lined up Wing again made
a clever center rush and ran sixty yards,
making a touchdown and goal, scoring
six more points.
In the seconu half neither side scored
until near the close of the game, when
Waldron for the cadets rushed over the
line and made a touchdown, but Connor
again failed at goal.
Total score: Weat Point, 12; Wesleyan,

crowd ol the year assembled at Denver
Athletic Club Park to-day to witness the
principal football event of the season, the
annual game between the Butte (Mont.)
team and the Denver Athletic Club's
eleven. The outcome was much in doubt,
though the betting was 2 to 1 in favor of
Butte, and many expected to see a sur
prise furnished by the local team, as was
done last year, when the betting favored
Butte, and the Denver club gave them a
severe drubbing. It did not take long
after the lineup, however, for the specta
tors to arrive at the conclusion that the
Denver boys were no match for the Butte
team, as ia shown in ths score: Butte 20,

HE COULDN'T WRITE,
A Pine-Street Broker's Curious
Experience With a
Client.
EXCITEMENT OVER A DEAL
Had to Wait a Month in Order
to Get a Check*
There was a group of men whose faces
are familiar on the Mining Exchange
standing around one of their most promi
nent associates a few days ago at the junc
tion of Leidesdorff ami Pine streets. Evi
dently there was a good story being told,
and a newspaper man who happened to be
passing joined the listeneis. Hispresence
was not objected to, the fact being that
mining men rarely if ever "sit down on"
the searchers after news. And it was a
mighty curious story, too. This is about
the cream of the whole thing: The broker
who was telling the story had a client who
was doing fairly well in the matter of
short speculations, and he had quite a fair
bant account. About a couple of months
previous to the time this incident occurred
he had made a very good buy, and inti
mated to the broker that he would "hang
onto'' the stockf or a few weeks at least.
Things began to come his way. The stock
rose, and though it became a trifle weak
on one or two occasions, it gradually crept
up. And, of course, tbe time came when
it seemed advisable to sell. The arrange
ments were all promptly made, the sale
executed, and there was a fair check
handed to the fortunate investor. The
broker admitted that he had noticed that
his client was scarcely as well as he had
known him to be in the few chats that he
had with him during the month previous,
but he did not think him seriously ill.
But, lo and behold ! the moment that he
took a pen in his hand to sign the necessary
receipt, release, etc., it was very evident
that writing legibly was out of the ques
tion. But that matter was passed over
gracefully, for the stock board man had the
most complete confidence in his client's
good faith and honesty. The next day the
speculator again appear-d and wanted to
place a very considerable margin with his
broker on another venture; "but perhaps
the rest of the story is best told in tue
words of tbe broker, as nearly as it is pos
sible to give them. He said:
"We agreed on the margin and he
pulled out his checkbook, but his hand
shook so that I asked him whether he had
not been out having a 'little time' the
night before; but he denied it hotly.* He
said: 'I did enough of that sort of thins
when I was young, and-perhaps I am suf
fering Irom it now. There's something
the matter with me, anyhow, and I guess
I am a pretty sick man.' And then he
tried to make out his check, but I swear
by all that's good and bad that he couldn't
make a mark, he was so nervous. Then
he began to break out in a cold sweat, and I
aidn'tknow what was going to happen
until he sat down, for a while. Then ne
seemed to recover a bit and asked me if I
knew of a good doctor to whom I could
take him. Well, I got a hack and off we
started for the Hudson Medical Institute,
at the corner of Stockton, Market and
Ellis streets, and I thought he was mighty
giad when we got there, for it is a long
time since I have beard a man give such a
great sigh of relief."
"Well, what did they do with him up
there?" asked one ot the crowd.
"Oh, they called Jthe chief consulting
physician, and he bad him put througa
an examination. Then they prescribed a
course of their 'Hudyan' â that is the r
great 'Remedio- Treatment,' you know â
and I left him with the doctors I here.
"I never expected to see him on Pine
street again," he continued, "but this
afternoon down he comes as bright and
clean and as brisk as a full-blooded colt.
Why, he surprised me; nerves all sound
and the color oack in his cheeks. Why, I
swear I wouldn't have known him ; and
you bet he put up that margin to-;iay all
right, and I guess he's going to win out on
it, too. But you ought to bear him talk
about that 'Great Hudyan.' Why, you
would think it was an elixir of life. Of
course, it cured his nervousness in great
shape, but he swears it has built him up
all round â feels like a new man and is full
of vigor, and all that sort of thing. One
thing is sure ttough, and that is he's fit to
give things a Shane up down here again
now, and if he wasn't pretty near the
other world a short time ago my name's
Dennis, aud not what it is."
A visit to the Hudson Medical Institute
brought no light on this peculiar case, for
the chief consulting physician said: "We
never speak of our patients or their ills
without their distinct permission, but if
this gentleman was suffering in the way
that ydu describe it is no wonder that he
was promptly oured if he used 'Hudyan,*
for in my very large experience I have yet
to see a case of nervous debility that
'Hudyan' does not promptly cure." Yes,
if any one wishes circulars and testi
monials of "Hudyan" they should write
to the Hudson Medical Institute, 5 Stock
ton street, San Francisco.

[Copyright, 1896, by t c New York Times.J
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 7â The Presi
dential campaign in the United States,
which closed on Tuesday, has been a
liberal education to the present genera
tion of Englishmen. Scores of them
have now a tolerable insight into our
electoral system where one had the barest
notion of it before. I suppose it can be
said with safety that never in her history
has England been so deeply interested in
an election in another conntrv, and the
London papers are still amazed al the en
terprise which led them to compile tables
and cnve columns of special dispatches
and comparative comment to the final re
sults. They had never done anything like
it before. As for the effect of the result it
pelf the business classes here fully re
flected the joy which thrilled New York
and all the East.
Most Englishmen who are not in busi
ness began' by rather sympathizing with
Mr. Bryan, despite the free-silver plank,
on general politico-social grounds; but
toward the close of the campaign they
came to comprehend that it was a choice
of evils and that Mr. McKinley was the
lesser of the two. Wiien the final news
came thore was practically no dissent in
the British press from the view that the
best thing had happened.
As I have often said before in these dis
patches, hawever, the English Liberals,
and tor that matter most of the Tories
too, take the gloomiest possible view of
the power which trusts, railroad combina
tions and other monopolies wield in
America, and they are predisposed to be
â  lieve that a revolution is coming every
time any political excitement is mani
fested. The action of the coal trust, for
.example, in raising the price of coal 6s pc
.â¢ ton in September has been more dis
cussed here than any other America!
event in recent years, and I have been con
tiuuaily asked about it by men who imag
me that it would necessarily lead to vio
lence and civic convulsions.
A year ago this week Lord Salisbury's
Guildhall speech was supposed to be an
epoch-making utterance, yet the only vis
ible change brought by the past twelve
months in the Levant is that many thou
sand Armenians who were alive then are
dead now. There is a very general im
pression, however, that important
changes, up to the present invisible, are
abo t ready to be proclaimed.
M. Hanotaax, the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs, was evidently not in a
situation to disclose any of them this
week, but the fact that he avoided all
mention of Egypt was promptly taken as
a sign of his comprehension that negotia
tions were pending which imposed silence
npon France concerning the subject she
habitually talks about when the Eastern
question is discu.-sed. Curiosity now cen
ters on the chance that Lord Salisbury
may have revelations to make at the
Guildhall on Monday night.
Some approach to detiniteness we are cer-
tain to tet, for Lord Salisbury has" less
' talent in the direction of empty word
spinning than any other foreign minister
known to history. Already we know that
an abandonment of Cyprus is no part of
his present plans, and it seems equally
ciear that England's position in Egypt is
at least not going to be submitted to Euro
pean opinion. Undoubtedly the tendency
of the past month's events has been to
strengthen England's hands and to put up
the price of her favors, and no doubt the
consciousness of this will be manifest in
Monday's deliverance.
What Prince Bismarck humorously de
scribed as "the quackinn in the duck-pond
over the splash of a stone I have thrown
mio it," has in the last few days taken on
a graver character. It must have been a
serious business, indeÂ«d, which kept tne
German chancellor at home, closeted with
the Kaiser and his chief ministers, while
the chancellor's brother, Cardinal Honen
lol;e, lay dead in Rome. This gave rise to
a report that Bismarck's prosecution had
been resolved on, but every one knows, on
second thought, that such action is impos
sible. Count Herbert Bismarck, who
turned up in Paris at the beginning Â«.f
this week, confided to his friends, how
ever, that prosecution of the Hamburger
Nachrichten was not unlikely, and that
in consequence his father would print
what further disclosures he had to make
in a Vienna paper.
Two days later the Neve Freie Presse
contained an article which was immedi
ately recognized as inspired by Bismarcfc
It declared that in 1875 Alexander II
wrote an autograph letter to Bismarck,
saying that the Russian army was restless
after twenty years of peace, and wanted to
ri^'ht somebody, an-! asking if Germany
would stand aloof if Russia attacked Aus
tria. The story goes on to aver that Bis
marck virtuously resisted these advances
with the result ihat the Czar arranged a
compact with Austria about the Ottoman
Empire, and let nis army loose against the
Turk instead of against Austria itself. All
tbis is told with sucn circumstantial detail
and is supported by so many collateral
facts, that it occurs to nobody to doubt its
truth. The excitement it creates in all
three empires is greatly heightened by the
understanding that much more matter of
the same port is coming. Count Herbert
Bismarck defends his father's action, so I
h ar from Paris, on the ground of me ex-
Chancelior's just rage at seeing the Ger
man Empire, which he himself made, now
going to pirces a3 the effect of stupid, ama
teur mismanagement.
Young Bi-marck says the KaiÂ«er has
now hardly a friend left amons the Ger
man Princes. Some of them he has
offended personally, others politically,
and as for the German people irery time
a new election is held it is discovered that
the Social Democrats have doubled in
numbers. On the other hand the young
Grand Duke of Hess*;, who is the brother
of the Czarina, and who, iike his sister, is
devotedly attached to his aunt, the
Empress Frederick, is forming a kind of
princely cabal against William with the
. idea of curbine his authority and forcing
him to consult the Federal rulers before
he acts in important matters, such as the
selection of a Chancellor or the settlement
of diplomatic questions. Through the in
fluence of the Grand Duke and of the
Czarina Russia has already begun restor

ing to their old importance the legations
she maintains among those minor Ger
man courts which Bismarck now regrets he
did not wipe out al the creation of the
empire, since they aie used to foment
particularism and to undermine the
supremacy of Prussia.
buchisthe Bismarckian view, and bo
lar as the Kaiser's relations with his lel
low-sovereitrns go there is only too much
truth in it, but the German Liberals deny
all rise. They say that if Germany is
really in danger of being deserted by her
aliies ana crushed between Russia and
France Bismarck's ingrained falseness and
the chicanery which "he displayed while
he controlled her foreign affairs explain
why she now has no friend". To make an
cvii matter worse, they add, he must now
shout from the housetops all the delicate
secrets of his official career, simply De
cause his swollen egotism is wounded by
the youne Â«,zar's failure to make a pil
grimage to Fnedrichsiuhe.
The BiÂ«marckian al egation that this
visit was in the Cznr's original pro
gramme, but that the Kaiser, when they
met at Breslau, persuaded Nicholas to
abandon the iuea, is officially denied, but
it obtains very general credence in Ger
many.
From w'lat Herbert Bismarck said in
Paris it would seem likely that there
wou:d be further disclosures on this point
as well as others. Since the Count's hur
ried return to Berlin, however, he is re
ported as repudiating most of the things
tie undoubtedly said in the French capi
tal. Humors are in the air that he has
fallen under tne crave suspicion of being
the p. rson who informed his father of the
breaking off of the Russo-German com
pact in 1890. This suspicion is based on
the fact that he remained in the foreign
office after his faiher's dismissal and was
one of the very few men who knew of that
transaction. It is possible, therefore, that
he at least will be prosecuted, and if he is
nobody will mind it much.
The marriage of the Due d'Orleans has
been lifted from the commonplace by a
remarkable incident, which cannot but
cause diplomatic friction between Vienna
and Pans. Nothing was thought in the
latter city of the fact that a great number
of the chief noble families of France went
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1896.
to Vienna for the ceremony. It was ac
cented as only another of th^ harmless
demonstrations which these relics of
medievalism are fond of making. Care
wat taken that the French embassador
should quit Austria for a holiday on Mon
day last, so as to avoid any official awk
wardness, and that was all.
But the duchesses and marchionesses
who accompanied the Orleanist pilgrim
age to Vienna had a surprise up
their sleeves in the shape of a big,
sumptuous crown, made on a French
mouel. It has the Bourbun lily as deco
rative motif, and at tha top is a huge
diamond, suspected by some to be the Re
gent diamond itself and described by all
observers as rivaling the best known of
Europe's crown jeweK When they pre
sented this pretty toy to the bnrie Â«he
spoke of it as "the crown of France, which,
please God, my husband will some day
wear." The Duchesse dv Luynes came
out of the room trcmbline with gratified
excitement and repeated Maria Dorothea's
exact words to the Parisian journalists
who were waiting to get details of the
ceremony. The reproduction by them in
Paris of this significant phrase has caused
tiie official papers of Vienna to make a
shuffling den al of its accuracy, but this is
discredited by the fact that the bride wore
the crown at t c wedding with xli the airs
of a queen, and by the subsequent tone of
the congratulations, Austrian, as well as
French, which the newly wedded pair re
ceived. Seeing that this was all done
under the eye of the Austrian. Emperor, it
amounts to a desperate affront to the
French Republic and no one imagines
that it will be swallowed meekly.
It is understood in Paris to-day that
the Austrian Emperor has stated officially
to the French Government that the
duke's bride said nothing of the kind
ita'.ed. This is accepted as meaning that
his disapproval of her words wipe/them
out from the diplomatic point of view.
Another "pretender" marriage is said
to be Itkelv to attract French notice this
winter. Victor Napoleon, who is now 34
yeras old, is understood to have been for
mally betrothed to the Princess Anne of
Montenegro while the recent wedding
festivities of her sister Helene were going
on at Rome. Anne is only a year younger
than Helene, and she too is strikingly
beautilul; but unless the Czar has given
to her also a big dot it is difficult to see
how her marriage with this almost penni
less heir to the Napoleonic tradition has
been made practicable.
The promotion of Dr. Creighton from
Peterborough to the Bee of London plea-ed
everybody so much that it has gone a long
way toward softening the asperities
aroused by the selection of Dr Temple for
the primacy. No ccademic luminary of
his ability has succeeded in making so
few enemies and so many friends a* Dr.
Creighton, so that the unanimity of the
praise he gets may be said to be the only
thing acainst him.
Dean Glyn's elevation to the See of
Peterbotough attracts less attention. It is
a re-p ciaijie appointment and no more,
and in cynical church circles it is assumed
that the rich vaults of Glyn's bank are to
he drawn on to restore the damaged west
front of Peterborough cathedral. All the
appeals for public subÂ«criptions that have
been made, and they were numerous, have
realized ouly about a tenth of what is
needed.
Althoueh in London Guy .Fawkes ob
servances are said to have shown a marked
decline, I hear fro.m various sources that
in many country villages theaay was cele
brated this year more vigorously than in
any year that even the oldest inhabitant
can remember. The explanation suggested
is that the rural persons oi broad church
views organized these festivities in order
to protest against the recent Auglican ne
gotiations ai Rome.
It is certain the phiianderings between
the Ritualists and the Vatican, even
though they came to nothing, pioduced a
deep feeling of resentment among the
rank and rile of the country clergy and
their friends of the squirearchy, and it is
quite credible that they should hÂ»ve
>:iven to the iads of their neighborhood a
few extra half crowns to incite them to
hang the wretched Guy a little higher
than usual.
There need be no doubt, I am assured,
that Mrs. Castle's sentence is to oe re
mitted without delay. There would be no
sentence at all if the existing law had not
rendered one mandatory on the magis
trates. Formerly English juries were
aliowed a large latitude in cases of klepto
mania, hut this system worked so baaly
and that defense came to be pleaded in
sued a depressing multitude of cases that
ibe law had to be altered. It is an in
teresting fact that since the change was
made cases of undoubted kleptomania
have vastly diminished in number here
to say nothing of the bogus ones.

DESTITUTION IN IRELAND
Thousands Again Face to Face
With the Gaunt Specter
Famine.
Corn, Hay and Poato Crops Ruined
and the I, nd ord Clamors
for His Rent.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 7.â The Bishop of
Rap oe, in a recent appeal for subscrip
tions in aid of the Irish party fund, spoke
of the bleak prospects before the agricul
tural population as operating against the
fund. The bishop hardly seems to have
realized how desperate the situation is.
The correspondent of the Manchester
Guardian, one of the most trustworthy
and least sensational papers In England,
declares that no such qppalling prospect
has presented itself during the present
generution.
Concurring reports show that the pro
longed and continuous rains of the
autumn have ruined the crops from north
to south. The rich lower lands have been
flooded for weeks at a time when the
harvest ought to have been proceeding.
Stacked corn and haystacks have been
submerged nnd potatoes are rotting in the
fields. In the poorer hill lands the small
farmer and cotter population are again
face to face with one of those failures of
the potato crop which has too often
brought the uttermost horrorJ of starva
tion and famine and disease among them.
As usual the Government is aoing noth
ing. The Irish Secretary's tour in the
west and northwest occurred before the
bad weather set in, and at a time when
little could be predicted of the harvest".
Since then he has obtained reports from
official sources â from landlord sources â
which can only be described as misleading.
The farmers on many of the large es
tates have apprised their landlords' agents
that no rent can be paid this year, because
no rent has been earned. But the land
lords have entered into a combination for
wholesale pressure on the tenants. U-ing

TURKEY'S SULTAN
YIELDS TO FRANCE
Pretends to Be Anxious to
Carry Out Reforms in
Armenia.
Repeats Former Promises That
Were Forgotten Soon After
Being Made.
SUSPECTS TO BE KELEASED.
Indemnity for Church Property De
stroyed and Instructions for
Protection of Christians.
PARIS, Fbance, Nov. 7.â Advices re
ceived here from Constantinople show
that when the Sultan received a report of
the speech delivered by M. Hanotaux, the
French Foreign Minister, in the Chamber
of Deputies last Tuesday in response to
an interpellation demanding to know
â¢ what action France would take in defense
of the Armenians, he sent one of his sec
retaries to M. Cambon, the French Em
bassador, who immediately pressed upon
The secretary the urgency that existed for
the Sultan to adopt measures that would
reassure public opinion and satisfy
Europe.
The Turkish Embassador in Paris has
now informed M. Hanotaux that the
Sultan has decided upon carrying out the
following reforms:
The release of prisoners throughout the
empire against whom no charges are
preferred ; to instruct the police that peace
able Armenians are not to be persecuted,
to convoke an Armenian assembly to elect
a patriarch; to court-martial Mazhr Bey
for allowing Fatter Salvator to be mur
â¢ dered; to dismiss the Vali of Ciarbekir for
the share he took in the disorders there; to
precisely instruct the Valis to repress
violence; to undertake the idemnification
of the Roman Catholic convents in Ana
tolia which were damaged during the out
breaks, to assist the inhabitants of the
districts which suffered most, and to pub
lish shortly a decree ordering the prompt
execution in Anatolia of the reforms
granted in 1^95 and the extension of these
reforms to the whole empire.
M. Hanotaux thanked the Embassador
lor the information and told him that he
had precisely instructed M. Cambon to
watch the application of these preliminary
measures. In his speech to the Deputies
in response to the interpellation, which
was submitted by M. Denys, Deputy for
Cochin China, and supported by M. de la
Fosse, Hubbard and others, M. Hanotaux
said that ihe Armenian movement would
not have taken upon itself such an in
tensity if contact with Europe had not
imbued certain Armenians with a desire
for independence. The excesses of the
Ottoman Government, he said, bad fur
nished legitimate motives for complaint,
and when the question assumed an aspect
of grave importance England understood
tho danger of acting alone. A concert
was established amemz the powers, and in
October, 1595, an understanding was
reached with the Porte that the latter
would grant reforms, which unhappily
had not been applied. Owing to the
anarchy which reigned in the administra
tive spheres trouble ensued and France
was bouud to use language the strength
and signiticance of which Turkey under*
stood.
The powers, he said, were convinced of
the necessity of their solid union, but
tnere must be no isolated action and no in
terference with the integrity of the em
pire.
"Amonj the fertile results of the recent
visit of the Emperor of Russia to Paris,"
M. Hanotaux said, "may be mentioned
the precise exchange of views in regard to
Armenia and the perfect community of
ideal which exists in United Europe will
give the Sultan to understand the neces
Â»ity of his assuring the security of all his
subjects of whatever race. But violence
will not aid the violent task of Europe.
France does not forget the traditions of
the religious protectorate which she exer
cises in the Orient, nor thÂ« bonds which
unite her to the Ottoman empire, but she
must proportion her efforts to the extent
of all the tasks devolving upon her."
MR. CASTLE'S GRATITUDE
Thanks Embassador Bayard and
Urges Him to Further
Effort.
Mental and Physical Condition of His
Unfortunate Wife a Case for
the Home Office.
. â¢ LONDON, Esq., Nov. 7.â Walter M. Cas
tle, whose wife was sentenced yesterday,
addressed a letter to United States Em
bassador Bayard this mornine, conveying
an expression of his thanks for the assist
ance rendered to Mrs. Castle and himself
by the Embassador and members of the
embassy. Castle also urged Mr. Bayard
to use every possible effort to effect the
release of his wife. He pleaded her inno
cence of any crime. He said she was men
tally irresponsible and in a precarious
condition of health.
A copy of the letter was also sent by
mail to-day to Secretary Olney at Wash
ington. Mrs. Castle will be taken to
America immediately after her release.
It i 3 learned that at the consultation of
Judges in the Clerkenwell sessions yester
day a number of magistrates voted for
11 rs. Castle's acquittal, but were outvoted,
whereupon they signed a petition to- the
Home Office praying for her release.
In view of the strong influence oeing
brought in her behalf and the evidence
given by the doctors that she is irrespon-
Bible, it is considered almost certain that
she will soon be set at liberty;
When taken to the prison yesterday
Mrs. Castle was treated like a"ny other
prisoner, no special orders having been
given to the contrary. Mr. Castle accom
panied his wife to the prison, and the
scene was most pathetic when he parted
from her.
Mrs. Castle was examined by the prison
doctor, who at once ordered her into the
iii firm ary, where sbo was made as com
fortable as possible, and two nurses were
detailed to take care af her. Much of the
afternoon she was hysterical and seemed
hafrdiy to know where she was.
The prison doctor displayed great sym
pathy and said: "Ims woman is not right.
This is surely a case for the Home Office
officials,"
Other officials ol the prison, accustomed
to such scenes, were deeply sympathetic.
The mental and physical condition of
Mrs. Castle continues the same as when
she was first removed to the hospital in
Wormwood Scrubbs prison. Bhe is no
better, nor can she be said to be any worse.
The prieon physicians are of the opinion
that prolonged confinement would greatly
lessen what chances she may have of per
manent recovery.
The Globe, commenting upon the result
of the Castle trial, says: Wo hope that Sir
Matthew White Ridley will not delay in
releasing Mrs. Castle. It is a degradation
of justice to punish this unhappy victim
of a serious mental disease.
American Asxaasxnatrd in Mexico
GUADALAJARA, Mexico, JSov. 7.â
Word has been received here from the
village of Ajiji, near here, of the assassi

FLEMING AFTER CARLISLE
The Discharged Chief of a De
partment Scores the
Secretary.
Accuses His Superior of Having Acted
in a Treacherous and Tyran
nical Manner.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 7.-Judge
W. B. Fleming, who was removed from
the position Â«s chief of the law and record
division of the Supervising Architect's
office, Treasury Department, on Wednes
day last, to-day s^nt the following letter
to Secretary Carlisle:
Sir: Our Government guarantees to all its
citizens the privilege of iree speech, so that
every man has the natural right to express in
a proper manner his political opimons. In
accepting office tne citizen forfeits neither his
civil nor his religious liberty. The civil
service lav.* was in tended not to destroy these
rights, but to protect them, so that the minor
official should at least be as secure in delend
ing the creed and nominees of his party as
would be a cabinet officer in exercising the
same inalienable rights.
No objection on yuur part to my activity in
the campaign which has just closed was ever
made known to me pending the campaign.
On the contrary, I was informed thut you held
to the view that you could not consistently
remove any man from ollice for exercising the
same right? which you yourself were exercis
ing. My removal from office, the first intima
tion of which was obtuined from the news
papers while on the train on my return to
Washington from my home, was therefore a
complete surprise to me.
No one knows better than yourself the
long friendship I had manifested for you, the
interest I had tak.;n and the sacrifices "of time
and money made by me in promoting your
ambitions. In view of all the fac.s it seems to
me that I was at least entitk-'l to some warn
ing and notice before being kicked out of office
without even the opportunity of declining to
resign.
Had I known or suspected that I could not
hoid office under this administration and at
the same time exercise the rights of an Ameri
can freeman I would have promptly tendered
you my resignation at tne opening of this cam
paign.
Inasmuch as other appointees of the present
administration, including many in your own
department, have been permitted to take an
active part against Mr. Bryan in the cam
paign, not only on the stump but in the work
of organization, without rebuke or removal,
it is evident that the cause of my offending
lies not in my actions but in my convictions.
It follows iherelore that you have ustti your
great office to suppress freedom of thought
and action and to punish those who dare to
differ from youâ a thing insupportable in free
governmentâ by terrorizing over the weak and
humble. For Mich abuse of public office,
which is a public trust, you cannot but be
held accountable at the bar of public opinion
as weU as by the verdict of history.
In conclusion, I can only say that humble
as 1 am I would rather be a discharged em
ploye of the Treasury Department, discharged
for doing my duty as I see it for my people,
than to be Secretary of the Treasury with a
record of sell-stultification such as you have
made for yourself, staring me iv the face.
This much of a protest I deem it proper to
make against your treacherous and tyrannous
action. Very truly yours, W. B. Fleming.
GENERAL BRECKINRIDGE REPORTS.
Recommendation That the Confederate
Dead be Taken From Trenches
and Regularly Interred.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 7.âln
spector-General Breckinridge of the army
in his annual report shows that accounts
of disbursing officers aggregating over
$72,000,000 have been examined durlt,g
the year. Recommendations to avoid an
unnecessary number of entries and need
less handling of the same sum and report
ing it over and over again have been fol
lowed out and a great improvement is
noticeable. The National homes for dis
abled soldiers are in fine condition and
reports from them show no decadence
anywhere. The fourteen arsenals and
armories of the army indicate that the
officers in charge display excellent judg
ment in the administration of affairs.
In the report of the inspection of the
National cemetery at Lexington, Ky., it
is stated "that the Confederate dead "still
lie in the trenches where they were buried
after the battles of Perryviile and Mill
Springs, uncared for. To make the ceme
tery National in the true sense I strongly
recommend that these bodies be moved
and reinterred beside those whom they
fought in the nearest National cemetery
and the care of the Government extended
to ail alifce."
The colleges at which military instruc
tion by army officers is given are declared
to be in a flourishing condition and ac
complishing useful results.

Severe Penance on Many Men Who Lost
on Bryan.
NEW YORK, N.Y., Nov. 7.-The season
of exhibition for those who made eccen
tric wagers on Bryan's election to the
Presidency opened yesterday. Tnis cus
tom in New York is prevalent chiefly
among the Germans. In many cases tho
penance is not so easy as it sounds. For
instance, one Bryanite has contracted to
roll a peanut a mile with a toothpick; an
other has to eat a sandwich made of shav
ing soap, and another has agreed to paint
a ton ot coal white, taking each particular
piece in turn.
General J. Madison Drake of Elizabeth,
N. J.. will go with bis btir uncut until
William Jennings Bryan is elected. In
August last the general made a bet with a
friend that in case Bryan was defeated he
would not again have his hair cut until
Bryan was sent to the White House, and
as a result of the bet the general already
has a crop of hair that is the envy of local
lootball players. As General Drake does
not seem inclined to baldness, he will
probably become a character in the State.
unless the bet is canceled.

TOKIO, Japan, Oct. 20. â The new
Japanese Cabinet has made a public dec
laration of its policy, but the terms em
ployed are not sufficiently explicit to indi
cate a practical programme. Suggestions
are afforded that the ministry incline to
ward removing all restrictions upon free
dom of speech and public meeting, and
even toward acknowledging the necessity
of parliamentary support. But no definite
promises are made.
Labor is beginning to take its stand
against capital in Japan. There have been
several strikes lately, and in every case the
employer? have agreed to the demands of
the employed. It is true that the demands
have not been excessive in any instance.
Indeed, the sharp rise in all commodities
that has taken place in Japan during the
last year justifies laborers in seeking in
creased pay. But the conflict having com
menced it is not likaly to terminate speed*
ily, especially as manufacturers are begin
ning to be greatly inconvenienced by a
scarcity of hands.
The Japanese Government has suc
ceeded in eetting its 5 per cent consoli
dated bonds included among the securi
ties quoted daijy on the London exchange
at a premium of I J^ per cent, which is con
sidered satisfactory, the quotation in To
kio being a fraction below par.
The Japanese Government has decided
to establish several new legations and
consulates in foreign countries, namely:
Legations in Hawaii, Mexico and Brazil,
and consulates in Antwerp, Sydney, New
chwang and Chicago. Consulates-Gen
eral already exist in Hawaii and Mexico,
but they will now be raised to the rank of
lajiations undercharges d'affaires.
The number of banks of all kinds exist

A company has been formed for the
purpose of cutting a canal across Japan
from the Bay of Osaka to the Sea of Japan.
The whole cutting will be 22>j miles and
the cost IJ^ miliion yen.
A case of cholera terminating with
shocking suddeness occurred at Wuchang
on the 21st of September. Dr. MacKay,
who hail been working for Â£ye years In
connection with the London Missionary
Society, was struck by the disease in the
early morning and before twenty-four
hours had passed life was extinct. Mr.
Mac-Kay's work among the Chinese is
spoken of in terms of the highest praise.
The port of Shashih, in the province of

Terrible accounts come to hand of in
cidents connected with the Mohammedan
rebellion in Kan-su. It is estimated that
10,000 Mohammedans, chiefly women,
children and old men, have died of hun
ger or been frozen to death in the hills
and mountains. Those that have sub
mitted number 18,000, women and chil
dren for the most part. Thirty or forty
thousand remained under arms among
the hilis in the southeastern district in
the middle of the summer. The business
of seizing and beheading the insurgents
was conducted with wholesale vigor so
soon as their strength had been broken in
any district.
An average of sixteen had been decapi
tated daily lor two weeks in Bi-ning on
June 16, and as 3010 heads remained to
come off, the sanguinary carnival was ex
pected to go on for an indefinite time.
Crov/ds of people watched the executions,
and it is easy to conceive the demoraliza
tion that must have resulted from such
prolonged intimacy with bloodshed.

IN A FLOODED COLLIERY.
Eighty Miners Have a Thrilling Experience
and Miraculous Escape From
Drowning.
SHENANDOAH, Pa., Nov. 7.â Eighty
miners had a thrilling experience and
miraculous escape from drowning in
Packer No. 2 colliery to-day. The recent
rains had caused the flooding of part of
the mine and a dam was built in No. 1 to
head off the flood and give the pumps a
better chance to catch up. Edward Wil
son, a miner employed in No. 4 gangway,
noticed the water rapidly rising In this
place and investigation showed that the
breastwork in No. 1 was breaking. Wilson
immediately gave the alarm inside, but
the water rose with such rapidity that the
miners were obliged to wade several hun
dred feet through water up to their necks,
nnd before they reached the bottom of the
slope they were frequently obliged to
swim. One of the men lost his cap bear
ing the mining lamp and was left behind
in the darkness. Three miner?, after
heroic efforts, returned, and found the
missing man floundering about in deep
water and so much exhausted that he was
hardly able to Keep his head above water.
They finally succeeded, . however, in get

NASHVILLE, Term.. Nov. 7.â A fright
ful crime was committed in this city at an
early hour this morning. One person
was killed, another mortally wounded
and the murderer then attempted his own
life.
For some months past TMiomas Lynch, a
hard-working mechanic who lived on
Allison street, in the Eastern suburb of
the city, has been acting very queerly.
His friends insisted that he was crazy, but
as none of hn acts were violent his lamily
refused to have him shut up ivan asylum.
It was believed that Lynch was insanely
jealous of his wife, who was quite a comely
and attractive woman. Lynch was also
greatly excited over the election. He took
deep interest in the financial question and
would talk for hours about the oppression
of laborers and how much money was
needed in the country.
Last night he went to bed quietly and
set-med to be :n a happier frame ofmind
than he had been for months. Early this
morning he rose stealthily, and going to a
drawer he took out a razor. Creeping over
to where his wife was sleeping he delib
erately cut her throat. Leaving her mor
tally wounded he went to the room where
the hired woman slept, and, taking her by
surprise, cut her throat. Finally, satisfied
with his awful work, he attempted his
own life.
Lynch and his wife are now in the hos
pital, and it is believed that they will not
recover.

BERLIN, Geemaxy, Nov. 7.â The Reich
stag, which will resume business on No
vember 9, will have a short session, but it
will, nevertheless, have an extremely ex
citing one in the discussion of promised
interpellations by various political lead-rs
upon the question of the right of Prince
Bismarck, or for that matter, any ex-
Chanceilor or Minister to disclose state
Eecreta. The truth concerning the revela
tions made through the medium of the
Hamburger Nachrichten, especially re
garding the Kusso-German neutrality
treaty, alleged to have been made at the
Foreign Office in Berlin, is that only
Prince Bismarck, Count Schouvaloff, the
Rnssian Embassador to Germany, and the
late Emperor of Russia, Alexander 111,
had any knowledge of the uuderstnnaing
until after the accession in 1888 of the
present Emperor of Germany through in
formation which he received from Vienna.
The Fre>ssinnige Zeitung and many
other politically biased newspapers are
having a great deal to say about the
Reichstae impeaching Bismarck for mak
ing the disclosures, but that sort of talk is*
arrant nonsense. Even if public senti
ment does not quite approve Prince Bis
marck's course or understand his motives
the public still so implicitly rely upon the
ex-Chancellor's patriotism that tne Gov
ernment could not possibly face the na
tional uprising which would manilest it
self against his prosecution. Prince Bis
marck is well aware that the country has
a complete trust in him and makes use of
this influence as a shield to defy the Gov
ernment. *
The ex-Chancellor, throuprh his persona]
organ, the Hamburger Nachricnten, is
still firing his big guns of defiance, and an
article in that paper therefore, while it
docs not in the least alter tho position of
the controversy, shows that the Prince
has no disposition to back down.
"Prince Bismaack's opponents in this
matter," the Xachrichten maintains, "are
not the people of Germany, but the party
newspapers. Everything that the Prince
has done has been for the best interest of
Germany."
This utterance is regarded as pretty con
clusive evidence that the old Chance/lor
has no fear of the result of the submission
of the whole matter of his official acts aud
the subsequent disclosure thereof to the
verdict of the people.
After the interpellations in regard to the
Bismarck disclosures are disposed of it is
the intention of Herr Richter, the Radi
cal leader in the Reichstag, to raise a de
bate upon the question of the suppression
of the practice of duelling, and in the
course of the discussion to demand of
Prince Hohenlohe, the Imperial Chancel
lor, an explanation of the murder of Herr
Siebeman at Carlsruhe, a few weeks ago,
by Lieutenant Baron yon Brusuvitz, for
which crime the lieutenant received frsm
a military court the nominal sentence oi
four jyears' confinement in a fortress and
dismissal from the army, a sentence which
nobody believes was intended to be car
ried out.
Besides discussing the questions, the
Reichstag will also deal before the Holiday
receÃS with a bill for the conversion of
450,000,000 marks of 4 per cent bonds into
3}4 per cent 3, the bill running uarallel
with a similar measure in the Landtag
converting three and a half milliards of
Prussian 4 per cents into 3^ per cents.
The anti-English furor wnich prevailed
in Germany a short time ago has been
amused by the publication hereof a wired
summary of the speech delivered in EJin
burg last evening by Lord Sheloourne,
Parliamentary secretary of the British
Colonial Office, ar.d son-in-law of Lord
Salisbury, in which he declared that it was
well that the world i knew that Great Britain
would never admit a rival in South Africa,
where the predominance of the Queen was
permanent.
Commenting on the language used by
Lord Sel bourne, the North German
Gazette denies the existence of any Ene
llsh right of predominance in "bouth
Africa, and the Neuste Nachrichten says
that the English claims to predominance
in South Africa which will always be con
tested are based upon nothing beyond
jingo pretensions*.
The National Zeitung says: ' "Enelish
politicians may continue their arrogant
shouts about British predominance, but
they must know that England is destitute
of do wer to enforce it.* The| talk of Lord
Selbourne and other English politicians
is mere pothouse language."

SPAIN SPARS FOR TIME
Promises to Crush the Cubans
in Sixty Days or Evacuate
the Island.
Regarded as a Clever Diplomatic
Move to Forestall Action by
President Cleveland.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. B.â A Journal
special from Washington says: informa
tion of the most startling character re
garding a correspondence between Presi
dent Cleveland and the Spanish Minister,
Senor Dupuy de Lome, concerning the
future course of this country toward
Cut>a, was current here to-day.
It is said that a few days ago the Presi
dent, in a semi-official manner, sent to as
certain from the Spanish Minister whether
he bad any information that he might be
willing to give regarding the future course
of Spain toward the insurgents in Cuba.
To this suggestion Senor Dupuy de Lome
is said to have returned a letter in which
he assured the President that within sixty
days from the date thereof (November 1),
Spain would have crushed the revolution
or withdrawn her troops from the island.
To this astounding rejoinder President
Cleveland is said to have replied, on the
following day, that he wouid consider that
information imparted by the Spanish
Minister as sufficient to justify this Gov
ernment in delaying any action until the
expiration of the time named, and by that
same token he would feel justified in
recommending recognition of the Cuban
republic should tne Spanish Governmeut
fail to restore peace within two months.
In the opinion of those who know the
Spanish Minister this move on his part is,
regarded as a clever diplomatic attempt to
forestall any action by tne President based
on the report that Consul-General Lee is
believed to be about to make, and to secure
a postponement of action by the executive
until the winter campaign shall have been
inaugurated.
DESULIVES WARFARE.

that General Castanellos has left Minas,

It is known that he has had an engage
ment with the rebels, but no details are
obtainable. It is supposed that the rebels
he encountered were commanded by
Gomez and Garcia. The military authori
ties here claim that the insurgents were
defeated, and the concentration of the
rebel forces prevented.
A fusion of all the local political parties
is projected, each party folding its flag to
gather under the National banner for its
preservation. A meeting to consolidate
the Union will be held to-morrow.

from the latter's family sat down on a
so;a and while in the midst of a conversa

Adventurous Career of a Young Man
E ucatcd at Santa Clara
College.
. PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 7.â Martino
Gomez, a gambler, formerly well known
fiere by the nickname "Uumruy," is re-
Vortea in a letter received here yesterday
from Willis Hartwig, an ex-Portlander
now in Havana, 10 be one of Captain-
General Wevler's most influential staff
ol'icers in the Cuban capital. This man
belongs to a once very wealthy Mexican
j family in Southern California, anu re
i reived a superior education in the Santa
am (Cal). College. Gomez, or rather
Abrego, his right name, was a natural ad
venturer and gambler, and *oon alter
graduating from the college he entered
upon a sporting life. Some months before
the Villard boom readied the zenith of its
inflation in this city Gomez won $8000 at
'"Bill" Briggs' faro gime in San Francisco
and the young Mexican, then scarcely 25
years of age, scenting good "game" in the
north, came to Portland, wnere he soon j
was recognized as the chief of the sporting I
fraternity, because of his da?h at the play I
and by reason of the lavish expenditure
of his winnings.
Gomez was a handsome fellow, despite j
li is swarthy complexion. 11l fate threw i
him into the society of a young woman of
â¢ about 22 year?, living in Oregon City.
. This young woman had a stalwart father
and an equally robust brother. They one |
day encountered Gomez with the inten
tion of killine him, ar.d their intended
victim is Slid to have paid $10,000 in cash
to save his life. Gomez pocketed his loss
without a murmur and left for San Fran
cisco.
Hartwig says that one dny he had busi
ness in the capt:iin-generai's palace,
where the first official he met asked
him if he was not from Portland. Or. lle
])iyii)g in the affirmative the officer intro
.dured himself as Colonel Martino Abrego,
once known nere as Gomez.
It is ten years since Abrego left San
Francisco to settle down as v tobacco
raiser in Cuba. The excitement incident
to the revolution iv the inland again
aroUs-e<l his adventuresome spirit and he
. forsook nis legitimate occupation, becom- |
â¢ing a captain of Spanish volunteers. At
"lhe time of Captain-General Weyler's j
arrival in Havana Gorges or Abrego had j
'earned a colonelcy by meritorious seivice. 1
This brought him to thenoiiceof the com
mandant three months later, resulting in
his appointment on Weyler's staff, with

Officers Are Close U,"on Their Trail
and News of a Battlj Is
Expec'eJ.
CAIITO. Cai, . Nov. 7.â AH secrecy as to
the identity of the arciue i murderers of
John H. Mndeett, tbe Csai rancher killed
last Monday, was waived to-day and the
excitement is intense. Anpry niuiterings
are heard because of the tardy arrival of
the Sheriff's officers, who had been re
peatedly notified that ample evidence was
secured to warrant arrests being made sev
eral days ago.
Trie names of the Etispected men are
John Dodge, one Fercuson, Rube Noble
and Cliaries Smith. All are mounted on
f-jsi horses and heavily armed, and are
made desperate oy the unexpected suspi
cions directed upon them. Citizen-"
cleverly detained them for three days, al
laying any suspicion by showing indiffer
ence as to whom the perpetrators of the
crime micht be.
This was done to gain time that the
Sheriff's parly mijMit arrive upon the
scene and arrest them quietly. The Cor
oner's jury's verdict was made favorable
to the suspected men in or.ter not to ex
cite their alarm. The verdict was:
"Deceased came to Ins d. ath by foul
menus by a party or parlies unknown,
etc."
The four became suspicious and de
camped, leading the Sheriff's posse by an
hour, and five officers ara now closely
upon tneru at their hidinjj place in Isiand
Mountain, thirty miles from here. Two
of the fugitives. Noble and Dodge, are half
breed lnili:inp, and are known to be dan
perou< men and experts with a lifle, and
should the officers come upon them a
stuuborn li^ht will follow.
Friends of lludcett give expression to
threats of speed; justice in the event of a
capture, should the officers bring the men
back this way. Mude-tt had no known
enemies in ihe neighborhood and was
always regarded with favor, and his im
mediate friends make no secret of their in
tention to revenge his assassination.
Under Sheriff Handy of L'kiah has
] charge of the posse and is referred to as
' an officer of more than ordinary bravery,
i who will ftaka His life to take his man.
The disagreeable mountainous trip
i from here, over poor trails, makes it difli
j cult to gei news from the scene with any
j tiling like certainty. To-morrow's devel-
I opments are looked forward to with more
l lhan ordinary interest, ami excitement is
at high tension. Couriers from the scene
are expected at any moment.

Demonstrations.
M'KINLEY'S ELECTION LEAVES

Republic m Triumph Hailed as the
Forerunner of an Era of
P.enty.
NAPA, Cal., Nov. 7.â Napa County's
hills and dales echoed to-night the ac
claim of hundreds of Republicans who
had assembled 10 ratify the victory of
Tuesday. The parade was one of the
loupes seen in Napa. Music was sup
plied by the Cali&toga band, the Napa
band and two local drum corps. Large
delegations from St. Helena, Calistoga,
Vailejo and neighboring towns were pres
ent to participate in the festivities.
At 7 o'clock anvils were tired on Third
street, announcing the start of the parade.
There were many lar.e and profusely
decorated floats in the procession, that of
the Napa woolen-mil. s attracting much
attention. On this float were six em
ployes of the njiils, who showed the
method in which some of Jthe work was
done in the mill. Fifty of Napa's young
men, under the leadership of Charles L,ev
inson, carried live roosters placed on
perches, from which Chinese lanterns were
suspended.
lhe Junior McKinley Club added nearly
100 to the marchers. On one float was
David fcchwartz, dressed as Uncle Sam,
continually ringing a large Dell. The
wheelmen formed no small part of the
parude. Ti;e bicycles were all decorated.
A large black coffin was carried hy four
wheelmen. On the coftiu were the follow
ing words:
: Willie Is Dead-Free Silver Killed Him. â¢
After the parade there was speechmak
ing or. tne public square, T. B. Hutchin
son presiding. Those w.iO spuke were:
Assembly man-elect P. L. Coombs. Percy
b. KinÂ»; and C. J. Beerstecner. The dem
onstration closed with three cheers for
McKinley and Hobart.
SAUTA ROSA. M ,KES MERRY.
Men of All JPariie* Join te the General
Jubilee.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Nov. 7.â Santa
Rosa's business streets were fairly packed
with good-natured people to-night, all
bent upon adding to the noise of the rati
fication meeting. The choice of the
people at the polls on Tuesday was even
more the people's choice to-night. Men
of all shades of political belief j ined in
the general jubilee, and altnost every busi
ness house on the main streets saluted
the parade with a shower of fireworks.
The procession formed at 8 o'clock in
front of the Grand Hotel, and under a
shower of roman candies and rockets
moved down Fourth street to the San
Francisco and North Pacific depot, coun
termarching back to the Courthouse. In
front rode the frrand marshals on high
stepping steeds, and an immense Ameri
can flair was borne aloft as the next fea
ture. Between two smaller flags the well
known featuies of Major M< Kinley
beamed down upon the crowds and elic
ited continued rnunds of cheers. Next
came the Santa Rosa band and the fire
works wagon, the latter decorated with
pumpkins cut and carved into hideous
rer>rest-nations of human faces and filled
with red fire.
Alter aii this the citizens on foot came,
bearing aloft dozens 01 transparencies and
seemingly trying to injure their vocal
powers. Some of the legends upon these
transparencies were sinerularlarly appro
priate and even witty. O:ie declared that
"It is Letter to be right than be President,
but what's the matter with beinc t.oth?"
A large delegation of farmers marched in
a body with itiii truthfui statement borne
aloft, "The larmers oi Sonoma County
were soiid for McKiniey."
Tne demonstration ended with several
three-minute speeches hy prominent citi
zens from the Courthouse steps and thre
final cheers for the great campaign of 1696.

SAN DIEGO. Cal.. Nov. 7.â The elec
tion of William McKinley to the Presi
dency was celebrated here to-night with
much pomp. At 7:40 o'clock a train of
five electric cars, illuminated by hundreds
of electric lamps, passed up Fifth street,
slowly escorted by mounted police ana
the full City Guard band. On the cars
were 100 of the most beautiful maids and
matrons in the city, all attired in white
and gold. The first car bore upon it a
polden throne, upon which sat Miss Carrie
P'lhamus, a beautiful girl, as Goddess of
Liberty. She was guarded on one side by
n soldier and on tlu % other by a sailor, with
Un'-le Sam behind her to â¢ ive advice.
WiiHn the cars reached Fi:th and D

monster celebration and parade to-night

to taps, which allowed the bells to drag
with noisy clang on the sidewalks, and
young America was out in all his glory.

and bells marched merrily onward, only
ceasing their tooting and ringing to rend
the air occasionally with shouts for

sound money.

strument that failed to make its appear
ance in this evening's parade, it is one
yet unknown to civilization, l'here were
immense tin horns which required eight
men to act as bearers, and relays of stout
lunged men to blow them. There were
Cbinesp songs and symbols innunipra
able. Even huge locomotive bells had
been filcned from the railroad shops, and
were borne on unprovised stretchers on
the shoulders of from four to six men.
A huge transparency in the form of a
Hour barrel was surmounted by an im:>ee
of a bear, with the inscription, "the Ex
aminer over a barrel; too much 16 to 1."
There were four in hands loaded â¢nth
noisy crowds, and the air was stifling
with the smoke of fireworks.

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Not. \ 7.âCongress
man W. W. . Bowers went to Santa Ana
this afternoon to attend the ratification
meeting. Before leaving he furnished the
figures of the Congressional fight, claim
ing to be elected by 242 plurality, with
only three small 1 precincts in Tulare
County to hear from. Mr. j Bowers cays
that the Associated Press gave out Tulare
County's plurality for Castle at 1038, while
be cairns 10 have personal telegrams giv
ing the figures at 751. j Mr. \ Bowers'
figures on pluralities are as follows:
For Castleâ Fresno 4G7, Kings 140, Made

The returns from this county are all in
and give Bowers 453 plurality. . .Regarding
these returns Mr. Bowers said:
"My figures show that â  I already have
500, and 1 have no doubt the official count
will run these figures up to ov-r 550. .The
count in San Diei;o this year has been lull
of fraud. .In' Pichacho Precinct, lor : in

"I attribute my small vote in San D go

treachery of : George Puterbuugh and his

baugh ran for Judge and was defeated in

Judges, ';â¢ Supervisors, Assemblymen, or
anything else on the Republican ticket, in
order to get Puterbaugh in. â

Yet this man Puterbau.h claimed there

tion, and bis candidacy was heralded as

takes a lot of lying and fraud to reform
politics. Pure politics apparently cnlls
for all kinds of rottenness and treacheiv.

SIXTY HJa . iiicT FIGHT.
McLachlan'* Friend* Hare Xot Conceded i
llarlou>'.i Election.
PASADENA, Cal., Nov. 7.â James
McLachlan, Republican nominee for Con
gress in the Sixth Congressional District,
said this evening regarding the outlook
for his re-election:
"I stated the day after election that on
the face of the returns I thought Barlow
had defeated me by from 300 to 500
p urality. Since then certain irregulari
ties have been discovered which will be
closely inquired into and which may
change the result."
Mr. McLachlan declined to express him
self further. It was learned from authen
tic sources elsewhere that Mr. McLachlan
underestimates the extent of the irregu
larities. In Pasadena alone nearly seventy
Republican ballots were stamped for both
McLarhlau and Barlow, which appears
stran eon the surface. The same thing
occurred in Monrovia and in certain
strong Republican precincts in Los An
geles. McLachlan's friends here do not
yet conceue his defeat.

LAST OF AN OLD
SLOOP OF WAR
The Swatara Was Towed
to the "Bone Yard '
Yesterday.
Alter Years of Service to Be
Broken Up for Her Ccp
per and Iron.
CHANGES AMONG SHIPMASTERS
Arrival of tlie Rio de J neiro From
Honolulu Without Kate Fields
Remains.
The old sloop-of-war Swatara has at
last reached her final resting place. Built
in 1872 by the United States she was then
the pride of the navy. Now she is lying
at Decotaville, near Hunters Point, an<i
to-morrow the work of wrecking her will
begin. Some weeks ago a full history of
tne historic old ship was given in The Sun
day Call and now all that remains is an
obituary notice.
Some time ago Uncle Bam advertised
the remains of the vessel as for sale. She
bad been dismantled and all that remained
of her was the hull. A company, headed
by ex-Pilot Johnson and John W. Cos
grove, superintending engineer of the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company, pur
chased the vessel and made all the ar
rangements for breaking tier up. Last
Thursday t ey sent the "Red Sack" Com
pany's tug Liberty to Mare Island to tow
her down, but the commandant would not
give her up, as he had received no instrnc
tions from Washington.
The teiegrapti was used, and after a
delay of twenty-four hours the vessel was
turned over to the captain of the tup. Off
Valiejo-street wharf the tug Sea Witch,
Captain George Harvey, took the Swatara
in tow and ran her* into the mud at
Decotaville. Strange to say Captain Har*
vey was the man who named the little
place. The first vessel ever up
them was the old ship Decota* and Har
vey towed her to the spot where t c work
of wrecking the Swatara will begin to
morrow. On bis return to San Francisco
he told the newspaper reporters that he
had run the old hulk ashore at "Decota
ville'' and it went into the papers accord
ingly. The name has stuck to the place
ever since.
The Swatara and the little tug made
quite a picturesque appearance us they
passed along the front. Only a stump of
the foremast remained and it bad been
sawed off close to tlie rail. The ports
were all wide opeu and conveyed a re
minder of the days when cannon bristled
along the sides of the stout old ship. Her
copper showed away above the water line,
and ju iging of the amount that must be
on her bot om the purchasers will make
enough out of it alone to recoup them
selves Some of the choicest timbers will
be made into canes and one of them will
be suitably mounted und engraved and
forwarded to President-elect McKinley.
When everything of value has been taken
out of the huil the remains will be set on
fire in order to s-ecure whatever iron or
conper that may remain.
The old Swatara was a wooden ship of
1900 tons displacement, 216 feet lone, 37
feet broad, 16 leet 6 inches doep, 680 indi
cated horsepower and an estimated speed
of ten knots.
There were more changes in the masters
of vessels yesterday than there have been
in a month. Nearly all the moves are in
the nature of promotions, *o the skippers
are happy. Captain Brissem of the
schooner Gotama nas been transferred to
the four-masted schooner Volunteer. For
a year he has been making most success
ful runs between here and Coos Bay, and
his owners have rewarded him. The Vol
unteer will load railroad ties for Mollendo,
Peru.
Captain Horine, who brought the Vol
unteer into port, will leave on the steamer
Mexico for Victoria, B. C, to take com
mand of the bark Colorado, while Captain
Jones oi the Colorado will take command
LAST OF THE OLD SWATARA.
The Remains of the Sloop of "War Were Towed From Mare Island
to Decotoville and There Run on the Beach. A Syndicate
Will Break Up the Old Warship for What Copper and
Iron They Can Get Out of Hen
of the bark Carrollton, and Captain Lewis
of the latter will take the ship Kennebec.
Captain Dedrick will succeed Captain
6riBsem on the Gotama, and Captain C.
Attwood will in future be master of the
four-masted scboonor Puritan, and Cap
tain Br.-wn, late of the schooner Tanner,
goes in the brig Luriine, vice Captain
Denny, resigned. Captain Birkholm, late
of th- F. S. Reiltieid, takes command of
the new five-malted schooner Inca, which
iia9 ju.-t been launched from Hall's ship
yard, and Captain Birkholm, late of the
Lottie Carson, lakes the F. S. Rprtfield.
Captain Anderson of the schooner Edward
Park takes the Lottie Carson, and Captain
Johnson takes the Edward Park.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1896.
Captain "Dick" Nelson has relieved Cap
tain Englebrettsen on the schooner Lizzie
Prien and will take her out on her next
run to theNehalem River. Captain Engie
brettsen made two unusually long pass
ages to that point, and now Captain Nel
son is going to see what he can do with
the vessel. News from the river is not
encouraging. The schooners Confianza,
Eureka, Arthur I and Theresa are bar
bound ar.d have oeen for some time. On
October 27 the tug on the river offered to
tow the Confianza to sea, but the captain
refused to go.
Tne tug went out herself, bound
for a neighboring port, and has not been
beard from since. This if according to a
private letter received from Nehaleui River
yesterday.
The old bark Marion was sold yesterday
by the United States Marshal to C. E.
Whitney for $1000. When the rush to
Alaska was on she took a number of
miners up to Cooks Inlet, but i.n her re
turn there was no money with which to
pay ihe crew. The men libeled the vessel
for $1500, but now that she has brought
such a small sum they will be lucky if
they have $500 to divide among themselves
when ail tlie expenses are paid.
A week ago the Southern Pacific's old
cripple, the Newark, was once again taken
off the route for repairs, and the Encinal
was put in her place. In consequence the
El Capitan had to be put on the narrow
gauge route, and all tue passengers are
clamoring. Especially on the 5:15 P. M.
trip is the grumbling roost notic able.
One-half the "passengers cannot get teats
on the little boat, and several people have
been hurt in the rush to get ashore at the
mole. Yesterday settees were placed on
the main deck ana a gangway irom ihe
steamer to the shore was put into opera
tion, but still the inconvenience was very
great. The El Capitan is one of the fas eat
boats iv the company's service, but slie is
altogether too small for the morning and
afternoon traffic, and if the company
wants to avoid a disaster or the filing of a
complaint with the Inspectors of Hu.ls
ana Boilers for overcrowÂ»i:n^ it will make
some change at once. What's the matter
with putting the Alumedu in commission
and letting her and the El Capitan do the
creek wcrk and put the Euciual back on
the narrow-gauge route?
C. A. Carosio, a salesman for a produce
bouse on Washington street, was charged
at the Harbor Police station yesterUay
I with assault to murder. He bad a row
with C. Callaban, and when the latter ran
away Carosio threw a hatchi-t after him.
Tne Pacific Muil Company's steamer
Rio de Janeiro arrived from Hongkong via
Yokohama and Honolulu yesterday. Her
stop at the latter place was unexpected,
but as there was considerable of fie Gae

Contrary to expectation the remains of

1 In fact the officers on that vessel were
; just as much surprised as those on tue

I They say there wai not even a whisper
about ihe removal of the remains, and
that if anything was to be done the Ha
waiians did not know anything about it.
While t c Ro was at Hon r kjng a

caught red handed and his execution was

JUSTICE TO JOHN O'TODLE.
The Man Who Bailt the Mil pit as Alms
house Wai .Never n Wain.
In an article published in The Call
two weeks ago an unintentional injustice
was done the late John O'Toole of Santa
Clara County. The article was about the
Almshouse at Milpitas, and In referring
to its building it was necessary to men
tion the man who built it. The informa
tion was obtained from what was thought
I to be a reliable source and made it appear
I a* if John O'Toole, the former wealthy
1 man who put up the house, was at thÂ«
time of the article's appearance almost a
pauner.
This, it seems, was erroneous. AU
though John O'Toole was not in anything
like the circumstance* he was many years
ago he was not n beggar by any means.
He was engaged in farming the Dunn
ranch and iirrd in the Twerny-one Mile
House near Gilroy. He had a little
money la d by and was on good term*
with his children, who were devoted to
his comfort and welfare.

REV. P. COOMBE'S
NEW CHURCH
Richmond's Congregational
Flock Has Chosen
Its Plans.
A Pretty Building to Be Finished
Off With California
Redwood.
FINE PARLORS FOR CHILDREN.
To Accommodate Worshipers With
Infants There Will Be Nursery
Attachments.
New plans have just been accepted for
the church which the Richmond Congre
gational flock proposes to build &t the
corner of Seventh avenue and Clement
street. Within a week work will be com
menced on the building, and it is ex
pected that before the end of the winter
the new church will be ready for occu
pancy.
The lot owned by the Richmond Con
gregational flock is 75 feet by 120 feet, and
the small church at present standing
there will be moved to the side of the lot
and added to the new building, with
which it will communicate by folding
doors. The old church will be utilized as
a Sunday-School and will also be used on
occasion to enlarge the seating capacity of
the new church, when the rolling screen
will be thrown up. The old church seats
about 300.
The building will be of wood on a brick
foundation. Its dimensions will be 36
feet by 62 feet with an altitude of 36 feet.
To the top of the spire will be 80 feet. The
roof will be supported by open trusses ot
dressnd Oregon pine and ihe seats and
paneling will be of California redwood.
Behind the main auditorium will be
two lart-e parlors and a kitchen. During
divine service these rooms will be open to
the children of any of the worshipers
who fand the litile ones too young to take
jnto churcu, ami who do not wish to
ieave them at home. A woman will be
in charge to take care of the babies and
see that the children keep quiet.
Rev. PinHp Coombe, who lias been pas
tor for two years of the R chmend flock,
is an active worker, and he does not in-
Front Elevation of the New Richmond Congregational Church*
tend that his new church when completed
a all remain closed all week. There will
be meetings nearly every night, an I the
young people will be induced, by lectures
and libraries, to tate an interest in intel
lectual culture.
William Thomas is the architect who
designed the new plans. About half the
money needed for the building has beon
promised, and an active canvass is being
made for the remainder by the financial
committee. Many promises of assistance
were made provisional on McKinley's
election, and tbÂ«ra is general jubilation
expressed that the result of the election
will materially strengthen the financial
standing of the church.
The following ladies and gentlemen
compose ihe financial committee for the
new Imilding: Captain H. W. Turner,
Chs. Coady, Miss Marguerite Maeuire,
Mi-s Alice Guthrie, Mrs. C. O. Hook,
Mrs. E. D. Allen, Mrs. Chatraan, Mis^
Annie Jum. Mrs. Forsyth, Miss Rutt,
James Nicol, Mrs. James N:col, Mrs. G.
AlcKillop, Mr?. Guddari, C. Swezey.
MILITARY FUNERAL.
Troops at the Presidio Escorted the
Remains of Captain Pierce to the
National Cemetery.
The funeral of Captain Francis E. I
Pierce, Company G, First Infantry, U. 8. j
A., took place at the Presidio yesterday
forenoon. The pall-oearers were Captain
O'Conneil, First Iniantry; Captain Potts,
Third Artiliery; Captain Califf. Third
Artillery; Lieutenant Brant, Fir-t In
fantry; Lieutenant Birkheimer, Third
Artillery, and Lieutenant Miley, Fifth
Artillery.
All the troops stationed at the Presidio
followed the remains to the National
Cemetery. The funeral column waÃ
headed Dy the First Infantry band, and,
according to military custom, the casket
was borne to the cemetery on a caisson,
company F, Captain Starr, paraded with
arms, and the company tired three volleys
over tne grave of the gallant soldier.
Chaplain Macombcr conducted the
services at the cemetery.
Captain J. J. O'Conneil, the chief
mourner at the obsequies yesterday,
served lor twenty-nine years in the First
Infantry with the late Captain Pierce.
The floral emblem tendered by Captain
Pierces company, G, was a " beautiful
token. There were many other appropri
at<- lloral offerings. The cantain was uni
versally respected and loved by the men
of his command. They regarded him in
a sense as a father, so Ms death caused
profound sorrow in the ranks of Cora
pa ny G.
During the Civil War Captain Pierce ac
quired special distinction for bravery and
t-ood conduc on the field of battle. He
was wounded in action and promot-d to
high rank in the volunteer service for
gallantry. He had but a few months to
F.erve before reaching the age of retire
ment. HiÂ« death occurred at the Presid.o
last Tuesday night and was doub.le?s
hastened by an accidental fall. A few
days prior to his death he made a mis
step and fell from the porch in front of
his house. He was ara mber of the Min
n-sota Commandery of the Military Order
of the Loyal Leeion, but had many friends
in the California Com mundery.
HORSE IN A SEWER.
Queer Plight of a Koslnante in a Nar
row City Trench.
One of the queerest accidents that ever
happened to a dumb beast took placÂ» Fri
day afternoon on Harriet street, formerly
known as Garden street. A sewer trench
has been dug on that thoroughfare during
the past few days to a depth of possibly
ten feet. Into this trench a large draft
norse fell, striking squarely upon its back.
It was being; driven from a stable when
this took place and, poing backward, did
not see the hole in time to turn.
Seen from above me animal was a queer
siKQt. All that could be noticed were four
feet, which were kicking vigorously and
threatening to cave in the sides of the
trench and bury the quadruped out of
sight. The trench was so narrow that the
nurse could not move more than it 9 legs.
After it had been there a short time the
officers of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals appeared.
It was impossib.e to pet the tackle ordi
narily used for such purposes under the
beast. All that could be done was to hob
ble two of its feet and hoist away. Then
it was possible to get straps and ropes
under, and the horse came up to the sur
face once more. Incredible as it may ap
pear, the* horse's back was not injured,
nor did the animal appear to have been
hurt in any way.

MILLIONS TO BE SPENT.
Enormous Steel Plant to Be Built In
Japanese Coal Fields.
M. Oshima, technical director of pro
posed great steel works in Japan, and
four Japanese engineers are at the Occi
dental. They are en route to examine the
great steel works of America and Europe,
in order to buy a plant of machinery cost
ing, approximately, $2,000,000. They say
they will buy where they can get the best
and cheapest.
The plant when finished is to have a ca
pacity of 100,000 tons. It will be built at
the coal fields in Southern Japan. Both
Martin and Bessemer steels are to be
manufactured.
All this Mr. Oshima set forth last nieht.
He also said the commission which he
headed would b3 absent a year from
japan.
"We want to put our country," he said,
"where it properly belongs â in front of
the van as a manufacturing nation. We
wnl need a vast amount of steel, and do
not want to depend on any other country
for it." Â
They will be here for several days and
will examine the manufactories of San
Francisco, and then go to St. Louis, Chi
cago, Pittsburg and other places, and on
to Europe.

The City Board of Examiners held a
session yesterday to make recommenda
tions regarding teachers' certificates.
Messrs Morton, FauiKner and Babcock,
Mrs. Wood and Miss Nolan were present.
Superintendent Babcock called up the
case of Mrs. Margaret Dvvyer, who re
signed from the department in November,
1891, and who wishes to be reinstated. It
was shown that her primary grade certifi
cate had been renewed once after her
resignation, but had expired in 1894. She
was reappointed as a teacher by the Board

her certificate had been allowed to lapsÂ°,
the examiners did not see that they had
any power to renew it and declined to rec
ommend such a course.

JACOB Z. DAVIS AT REST.
Remain a of the Wrll-Rnown San Fran
ciscan Cremated in Philadelphia.
The body of Jacob Z. Davis has been
cremated in Philadelphia. This informa
tion has been received here in a letter sent
by a gentleman in Philadelphia, who was
related by marriage to Mr. Davis, the let
ter being addressed to C. B. Holbrook as
secretary of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, of which Mr. Davis
was president.
It was at first understood that the body
would be brought to San Francisco for in
cineration and preparations were under
way to pay the proper Masonic honors,
Mr. Davis having been a Mason of very
high decree. The members of th two
humane societies, with both of which he
was identified, a. so appointed committees
to take appropriate action.
It was ihe wish of Mr. Davis that his re
mains should be cremated. He was one
of the earliest promoters of the idea on
the Pacific Coast that cremation was the
proper practice and he was largely in
strumental in bringing about the erection
ot the first crematory to be built in Cali
fornia. The remains of his wife, who died
some time ago, were also cremated. The
writer of the letter from Philadelphia also
said that the ashes were buried in a ceme
tery in that city.
Mr. Davis was one of the well-known
citizens of San Francisco having a marked
individuality and being open handed and
liberal to a degree in reference to the
charities in which his sympathies were
largely interested. In addition to being
the president of the Society foi the Sup
pression of Cruelty to Animals he was also
vice-president of the Society for the Fre
vention of Cruelty to Children.

SEEKS FOR EIGHT OFFENDERS.
Concessionaires Attempt to Enforc;
the Payment of Large
Royalties.
SAN DIEGO, Cat.., Nov. 7.â The
steamer Pacheco, which sailed from here
"Wednesday night, ostensibly on its regu
lar trip to San Quintin and way ports in
Lower California, is now said to be
on a chase after eight guano-poaching
schooners which are believed to be
pothered in Vizcaino Bay. These craft
are the junk Acme, Captain Chase, and
ihePekin. Captain Moodlin; the schooners
Kllen, Captain .Hnsen; Wahlberg, Cap
tain Martin; Hongkong, Captain Horn
stein; Alta, Captain Farwell; Sailor Coy,
Captain Edwardson, and Ida, Captain
At wood.
Most of these schooners sailed from
this port the latter part of October and
are now probably at the Guano Islands.
These islands are about 350 mi.es south of
San Diego. All of them were formerly
covered with guano and have kept a fleet
of small craft busy carrying the fertilizer
tothispoit. The deposits are owned by
the Mexican Land and Colonization Com
pany, which has a concession from the
Government for all the fisheries and de
posits on the peninsula coast. The com
pany claims a royalty of $2 50 per ton and
the Ensenada customs officials impose
port charges of about $70 on each schooner.
The skippers say this is too much to make
the business profitable, anil therefore they
run down and get the guano and bring it
to San Diego without stopping to visit the
Ensenada officials or to render an account
to the company.
When O. J. Creweread assumed the
management of the company a iew weeks
.ipo he served notice on the guano-poach
ers that they would be prosecuted for
lurtlier encroachments on the company's
prcservis. The present trip of the Pacheco
is for the purpose of apprehending the
schooner--. Last year the Pacheco made a
similar trip and overtook the schooner
Pekin at San Martin Island. Two boys
were on the island gatnering guano and
another on the schooner. The schooner
got away, but the steamer captured the
boys on the island, together with 900
sacks cf guano. The boys, Wilbur Dane
and William Forest, are now servinsr a
sentence of eighteen months in the En
senuda jail.
WIELDING RODS .
ON STOW LAKE
Second Annual Tournament
of the Fly- Casting
Club.
Champion Harry Golcher Failed
to Reach the Record
Distance.
The San Francisco Fly-casting Club
held its annuai tournament yesterday at
Stowe Lake, and a more perfect day for
fly-casting could not be desired.
In the forenoon, while the long-distance
casting contest was in progress, a sharp
wind was blowing Irom the northeast.
It greatly interfered with the casters who
â¢were unable to cast a straight line against
it. H. C. Golcher, the champion long
distance of America, tried hard to equal
his record ot 103 feet, but he failed by 14
feet. After the contests were over he took
to the platform again, and although the
wind favored him somewhat he was un
able to cover more than 99 feet, wnich f^at
was, however, loudly applauded.
Henry Skinner, who is the nearest cp
vonent to Mr. Golcher in long-distance
casting, has been nursing a sore arm lor
some months, and although the effort
must have caused him much suffering he
managed to run out G9 feet, which is a
very poor performance for an aneler who
has lrequently In pnictice reached the 80
-yard mark. Messrs. Lowry and EJwards
accredited themselves very well consider
ing the limited practice they have bad at
tbis particular style. \
The result of thÂ» contest is os follows-
H. C. Golcher, 89 feet; E. N. Lowrv, 7^
feet 6 inches: Colonel G. C. Edwards! ~0
feet; Colonel GL G. Young. <JG feet; H. E. I
Skinner, G9 ieet; A. F. Lovett, 70 Irti.
Golcner won first prize, Lowry second, Ed
wards third and Lovett lourih. Judgesâ
Josiii Hunt and H. Smythe; reieree, J. B.
Babcock; clerk, A. Rus'sei Crowell.
The second event on the programme was
a contest lor distance and accuracy.
Eleven membersentered for the trials and
as will be seen by the following scores
Colonel Edwards won rirst honors and
Ekinner and Golchertied for second place.
In accuracy Bfcinner was the most per
fect, casting a beautiful fly. but G-olcher
had distance under his "thumb. Â«=o io
speak, and ran up his score on Skinner in
the casts at the ti.ird buoy. Bacln Her
proved to be a warm competitor, who I
with practice will run into fir t place at
the next annual tournament, as be has
splendid control of his rod.
Bogurt cracked off his fly when casting
at the tim buoy and withdrewâ tuns fell
from grace and out of the race one of the
champion anglers of Tmckee River.

The buoys wnich were cast at were six
inches in circumference, and situated 50
56 and 00 feet respectively irom ihe edge
of the casting platform. Each of the con
tes'iunts had three trials at each murk.
The contestant landing his fly within one
ioot of the mark scored a perfect cast, and
each loot in t-xevss of one lo'>t irom
the buoy constituted a demerit. The sum
total in dement- divided by three was the
demerit pÂ°rcentÂ«ge. an I the demerit per
cetxt ded Octet) Irom 100 was the percentage.
The contestant Booting the highest per
centage waÂ» declared the winner.
The third and last event on the pro
gramme wns tue contest for accuracy and
delicacy. The buoys in this race were the
same as were used" in the previous event,
but they were situated clossr to the con
testants. The distances were thirty-five,
forty and forty-fv? feet from the edge of
the platform. The rules that iraverned this
contest stated that if a fly fell within one
foot of the buoy cast at, the accuracy shall
be considered perfect.
The percen' ages scored for delicacy and
accuracy were udded together and divided
by two, the result being the percentage.
The contestants were allowed thirty sec
onds toexteno. line by dry-fly casting to
the thirty-live foot huov. "Dry-fly castine
means whipping the fly in the air until
the order to cast was given when scoring
commenced.
Scores did not count in any event where
the fly was lost during the time of the
contest. All castin*; was done from the
reel, as it was contrary to rule* to have
any loose line on the platform at the time
of casting.
The result of this contest was as fol

Professor Kennedy's Marvelous Per

The appearance of I'rofessor T. A. Ken
nedy, the mesmerist, at the opening per
formance of the New Bush-street, Theater
last night â  was met by a large audience,
which did not restrict itself in applauding
its appreciation cf the entertainment.
Professor Kennedy adds much more to
the usual mesmeric performance. He in
troduced several novelties last night. For
instance he had aaubject,. while under the
"influence,'' drink a concoction of eats
foot oil, kerosene, cayenne pepper, etc..
which would have either killed an ordi
nary man in fifteen minutes or driven him
into "conniption '. fits," but neither of
these occurred. '
The audience was kept in a continual
roar of laughter throughout the entire
evening, lie had bis subjects go through
many ludicrous performances. . With the
revived interest of the latter end of this
century in scientific discoveries and de
velopments Professor Kennedy's per
formance^,this week Xv ill furnish a source

REVIVAL OF AN INDUSTRY
A Glass-Bottle Factory Opening
With Nearly Three Hundred
* Employes.
As a Consequence cf the Rspubliean
V.ctory These Workmen Will
B a Happy.
One of the signs of returning prosperity
is to be seen in the opening of the San
Francisco and Pacific Glass Works at Sev
enth and Townsend streets. Some months
ago these works closed down under the
pressure of dull times. As the campaign
wore on, the proprietors of the works be
came convinced that McKinley would be
elected. So they took advantage of the
depression in business and made extensive
alterations in the plant, with a view of re
opening after election.
"We gucsed pretty well," said Super
intendent Davis yesterday, "when we con
cluded that McKinlev would be the next
President of the United States. It was
then that we determined to prepare for
prosperous times and to be in shape for
meeting outside competition for Pacific
Coast business.
'We started work to-day on a small
scale with thirty men. NÂ»xt Monday we
will put between 100 to 150 men at work,
and the following Monday will be ready
to have between' 200 and 300 men, boys
an.l girl* steadily employed. Then our
works will be in lull operation. We pro
pose to pay out for laoor alone at ieast
$150,000 a year and as much more for ma
terial, all of which is got in California ex
cept the soda ash.
"The industry is a very profitable one to
the Pacitic Coast. Most of the bottles
used on the coast come from Europe and
the East, but now with assurances of pro
tection and good times we don't propose
to have any foreign bottles coming in
hereafter. Formerly we could only sup
ply San Francisco and a small district
around the City, but now we are ready for
the whole coast business."
The work* have been remodeled, with
crude petruleutn furnaces in place of the
old coal retorts, and the capacity will be
so increased tuat about '200 tons "of glass
can be melted at one time. With the new
system the industry can be carried on
profitably a^d the glass-blowers paid
irom $4 to $â¦> a day.

TITE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER S, 1890.
DID HE TAKE
HIS OWN LIFE?
Body of a Well-to-Do At
torney Found Floating
in the Bay.
Michael Seeligsohn Thought to
Have Filled H:s Pockets With
Recks Before Suicide.
THE MYSTERY CF A MOTIVE.
No Reason for the Rash Actâ Sad End
ing rf a Brother's Anxious
Search. ,
Michael Seeligsohn, of the firm of
Rankin & Seeligsohn, a young and
prosperous lawyer, well-to-do and well
connected, has, in the opinion of the
Morgue officials, committed suicide. His
body, weighted with rocks, was found
floating in the bay off Goat Island by H.
E. Nicholson and R. T. Hoourg while out
yaehilig last evening.
The body was towed to Mission-street
wharf by the yachtsman and the Coroner's
ollice notified.
The case is a very mysterious one. De
ceased, who was ,*>s years of nge, had been
enjoying a lucrative practice and, with the
exception of a slight affection of the
throat, was vigorous and healthy.
A week ago last Wednesday he left bis
lodgincs, 309 Powell street, where he had
been rooming for three years prior to his
death. He did not again return, and the
proprietor of the hou;^, Joe Cohnreich,
notified his brother, Aoe Seelissohn,
editor of the Jewisb I'rosross, and his
sister, Mrs. Simon, wife of E. Simon of the
firm of Simon it Jacobs.
Mr. Simon concluded that his brother
in-law had left the City for Tucson, where
he hail a brother livuiir.
But little was thought of the matter
until yesterday, when Z. Seeligsohn, also
a brother of deceased, railed at 309 Powell
street in search of the suicide.
He was worried at the mysterious dis
appearance and was about to telegraph
his brother at Tucson, when- he was in
formed that the body hnd been found.
The family was greatly surprised to hear ,
of the drath of Mr. Seeiigsohn and would j
hardly believe that he had committed
smcidp. There were no marks of violence j
on the body, however, an:l the fact the
pockets were tilled with rocks was thought
to dispel all theory ot foul play.
Last evening E. Simon of 1911 Van
Ness avenue, brother-i-n-law of the de
ceased, stated that he was sure that his
relative had met with foul play.
He had started East on business, and at
the time of his departure he was known to I
have had a valuable diamond ring and a j
diamond pin besides a large sum of money, j
Mr. Simon does not know the amount. |
He and ins friends believe that the lawyer I
fell among lootpads, who murdered him i
for his property, and after weighting the I
body threw it into the bay. The police
will be asked to investigate the case.
MARIN DEMANDS
THE LAURELS
Because She Gave a Larger
Republican Per
centage.
Alameda Men Sccff Scornfully
at the Claim as
Absurd.
Little Marin County, where they make
the best butter and lay the best eggs in
the woi ld; that is, where the cows make
the butter and the hens lay the eggsâ no,
where the beat cows give the best milk
from which the best Republicans make
the best butter and the best Republican
hens Jay the best eggsâ little Marin
County now demands the champion flag
from Alameda as the banner Republican
county.
The champions of Marin allege that,
although Alameda County gave a big ma
jority for McKinley, it was only OG% per
cent of the whole vote, whereas Marin
County's majority is GO 1 * per cent of the
vote of Marin County.
Alameda demands the flat; from LO3
Angeles, and Los Angeles will return it to
Alameda, from which county it wrested
the Republican championship several
years axo, but Marin has stepped into the
ring and declares her intention of fighting
for the trophy.
The Mann men are very much wrought
up about the matter. It would hi dan
gerous for any one anywhere, except on
the top of Mount Tamalpais, to speak of
the matter in a light or flippant vein.
'Twould be more risky than smoking a
pipe while seated on a sack of loose dyna
mite.
Among the indignant citizens is C. C.
Bruce of the ship-chandlery firm of Bruce,
Binn Â«fe Co. he has addressed a letter to
the Republican State Central Committee
of the following purport:

tral Committeeâ Dear Sir: I notice that Ala
meda County claims the champion flog as the
banner Republican county of California. I
have spoken in relation to this mutter with
members of your body, and have been told
thai it was a question of percentage. If that
be the case, I hereby eive notice that Marin
County claims that banner. Respectfully,
C. C Bruce.
Ben Mnrkeley is wild in his desire for
tbe banner.
"I'll tell yon what we'll do." he said to
a Cali, reporter yesterday. "We'll go over
in a Dorty to Alameda and take that flaz
on Monday. We won't take it to-day, be
cause we have no desire to spoil the Oak
land parade to-night. That flag is ours."
Members of the Oakland Alliance Club
say that the Marin County Club will never
see the banner unless they go over to Ala
meda Ccunty to see it.
J. W. Lvdecker of Alameda says that
Alameda County is entitled to the flat? and
will have it. He always understood that
the contest was between Alameda and Los
Angeles. That is what the Ha^ was made
for in the lir.n place. Small cow counties
were not eliaible.
Senator Eli Penison, who caused all the
trouble by naving the flag made in the
first place, remarked last night in accents
of cutting sarcasm that the Marines
should at leapt have had the decency to
wait for the official count before claiming
the flag.
This being heard by Bruce, that gentle
man retorted with sarcasm ot equal inten
sity, "What's the matter with iJenison? I
think it was a very discourteous act on
the part ot the Alameda swamplanders to
send to Los Angeles for the flag before
â even the returns were all in."
Secretary lliggins said that if the cham
pionship were to be decided on a percent
age basis some small county with ten or
fifteen votes would get the flag. The
State Central Committee had nothing to
do with it, ne said. The flag had been
made by order of Senator Denison, and
Alameda and Marin would have to fight
it out.
NOT A TRUST OF
THE STEVEDORES
So the Supreme Court Has
Finally De
cided.
Upon This Issue Hinged a Suit
to Get an Account
ing.
The Master Stevedores' Association was
organized a few years ago, and took in
about all the stevedores in the City. After
a time dissensions arose, and the associa
tion brought its quarrel into court.
Albert Herriman and others sued Stewart
Menziefl and others for an accounting,
and won their case. An appeal was taken
by Menziea to the Supreme Court, and
therein he held that there was no cause
for action, because the Master Stevedores'
Association was in fact a trust. The Su
preme Court did not coincide in this view.
A decision was handed down yesterday
which aftirmed the judgment of the trial
court, and the effect of this is that Herri
man and others will get the accounting
they have soucht. Justice Van Fleet wrote
the opinion and Justices Gnroutte, Har
rison, McFarland, Temple and Henshaw
concurred. Concerning the contract be
tween the members of the association the
opinion contained the following:
V c are unable to coincide in tins construc
tion Oi ihe contract or io perceive anything
therein whtcb renders it Invalid upon the
grounds stated. The objection that its effect
is to create a monopoly in and to unduly re
strict the business of stevedoring does not liud
suppon in its terms. A monopoly exists
where all or so neariy ail of an article of tra-lc
or commerce within a community or district
is brought within the hands of ono man or set
of men, a.s to practically briup the Imndling of
the commodity or thing within .single control,
to the exclusion oi competition or free traffic
therein. Anything less than that is not mo
nopoly.
.Winning that the business of stevedoring
is a thing which is the pr- j>cr subject of a
monopoly within this definition, there is
nothing in this agreement to render it obnox
ious to that objection nor anything to show
that it will operate to unlawfully restrain
trude. H nowhere appear* therefrom that
the parties to this contract, by the combina
tion of their business interests provided for,
are in the control, or anything like ihc con
trol, of that business in Ban Francisco to an
extent t"> enable them to exclude competition
therein or control the price oi such labor or
business. There is absolutely nothing to show
Hint they comprise more thsn the most insij
nilicant'pim or fraction, either in number or
volume of business, of those engaged in that
trade in this community.
We are not Rt liberty to indulge in infer
ences which would restrict the parties iv their
right to combitie their Interests. We tind
nothing in the terms of the present agreement
wbicb would neeewariiy work an unreasona
ble restriction in the icannerof conaucting
tne business in question, or which would
necessarily interfere with the freedom or right
oi others not parties to '.he contract, to er.jjage
and carry on such business. After a caretul
review of all the authorities, we are unable to
say from the terms of the present contract
that it, to any extent, trenches upon the rule
of public policy invoked, or that there is any
thing within i ;s provisions whicb should pre
clude the parties thereto trom enforcine it.
DRANK CARBOLIC ACID.
Marie Zwall Quarreled With Her Hm-
band and Committed Suicide.
Marie Zwall, 3G years of age, wife of
Schelte Zwall, a tent maker, residing ai
118 Valencia street, committed suicide in
her home last evening by drinking a
quantity of carbolic acid.
According to the statements of Mr.
Zwall the suicide was caused by domestic
trouble.
"My wife and I had a quarrel over some
trivial affair," he said to Deputy Coroner
Hallet, "and she ran into a back room and
swallowed a dose of poison.
"I hurried for a physician, but he could
do nothing for my wife and she died in a
few minutes. I don't know what she
could have been thinking of when she
drank the acid. Our quarrel amounted
to nothinc and couldn't have caused her
to kill herself."
Tho suicide wns a comely appearing
woman and leaves two small children.

FREEMAN'S RIDING CRITICIZED
Howard S Again a WinnerâThomp
. son oa Lincoln II Stole > Race
From Damien.
If the walking had been good many of
the talent would have preferred returning
to town that way instead of riding back
â¢ in the cars at the conclusion of the races
at Ingleside yesterday. Many different
things contributed to the defeat of the
favorites, who were slaughtered with one
exception. For instance, Willie Martin,
the veteran, after having the mile race at
his mercy with Damien, tossed it away by
cetting careless and allowing the two
ky;ar-old Lincoln II to steal it by a nose.
' After this owner Pat Dunne should tell
Willie to win a "city block." Then Duffy
managed to get Santa Bella away frotn
the post poorly, and where she should
have won easily she was beaten a neck by
Montgomery.
Hannetta, another choice, showed speed
for a way and then blew up, and so it
went. Followers of the "dope," handi
cappers and all were at sea, and the pen
cilers were in clover.
" The usual big Saturday crowd was
there in full force, and the betting was
about the bes: of the meeting. The
weather was sunny and warm and the
track in perfect condition.
It was said by the stable that Ruinart
would have done ail sorts of things to
Libertine had he not been left at the post
in that mile dash some days asro, and" all
were anxious to see him perform against
a real good one. He had the opportunity
in anotner mile dash yesterday and
brought up in the rear.
BCarrying 108 pounds, he started a hot 7
to 10 favorite over Damieu, Instigator,
Lincoln II and Hazard. Patsy Freeman
managed to get him pocketed soon after
the start and keeping him trudging along
; in the heaviest going next tiie rail was
never a dangerous contender. Willie
Martin on the 8 to 35 second choice Damien
made the running, and it looked all over
when, in attempting to draw it too tine, he
was caught napping by the 13 to 1 chance
Lincoln 11, who came fast on the inside,
and beaten out a nose. g
Alv.ero, carrying Sam Hildreth's colors,
took the opening six-furlong dash without
much trouble, starting a 9 to 10 choice.
H. . Martin got him away in front, and
maintaining the lead throughout, woa by
over a length from Castanette, n 10 to 1
suot well played to win.
.. The ioliowers of Howard S again got a
good price against riie brown colt in the
tive and a half furiong handicap for two
year-olds that followed. Hannetta, with I
106 pounds up, caught the popular fancy j
and received the buik of the "support at !
odds of 3 to 2, which was cut later to even j
money. She ran well for about half the
distance and then began falling back.
Enos made his run with Howard S in the
stretch, and the Whisiiejacket youngster
.downed George Paimera neck "very clev
erly.. The winner, who packed 117 pounds,
was as good as 6 to 1 in the betting.
Both tiie first and tecond choices failed
'to get within the money in the seven-fur
long run. Navy Blue, at 11 to 5, had a

slight call over Jay Wheeler, who was ]
played down from sixes to 2J^ to 1. Nar
vaez gradually forced Arno, a 6 to 1
chance, Into the lead and passed the
ju.iges nearly a length in front, of Peril.
There was nothing of a tragic nature
connected with the mile and a half hur
dle affair save possibly the downfall of the
two choices, not an unusual occurrence.
Backed from sixes to threes the others
held aloof from Baby Bill, and he won
about as he pleased from J 0 C, the second
choice. The favorite (Governor Budd)
was beaten away off.
A five and a half furlong consolation
purse saw the 6 to 5 favurite, Santa Bella,
beaten through her rider's B.eepy tactics
at the post.
Duffy, sound asleep when the barrier
â was raised, was rudely awakened by a
near-by locomotive oell'in time to see the
third choice, Montgomery, out in front.
He took after hiiu, and although the filly
made up a deal of lost ground succumbed
by a neck at the end. Dolore, heavily
played, was third.
In the last race, over six furlongs, the <
to 10 favorite, Una Colorado, was simply
outfooted. Racing bead and head the en
tire distance with the 15 to 1 outside
Veragua the long-priced one more than
held his own, getting the verdict by a
short head. The eight starters were all
restless at the post aud SU Aiguon was
finally left.
Notes.
McManon, who rode J 0 C in the hurdle
event, was temporarily suspended. The
horse did not run up dangerously close,
but then McMahon is probably as inno
cent as the remainder of the jumpiug
horse riders.
Torpie & Co., a new bookmaking firm
here, cut in yesterday. They Had the
first stand and "bandied considerable coin.
Arctic Has undoubtedly ceased to exist
as a good racehorse. He pulled up very
lame yesterday.
Jty Wheeler was backed down from
sixes to '1% to win the third event, but
was unfortunate in getting away from the
post poorly.
One of the good things of the day was
Monterey, agaiuat which the ring laid 100
to 1. Those in the Know eagerly gobbled
up the 10 and 12 to 1 show odds against
him. Although Bookmaker George Rose
lost on his two-year-old Jay Wheeler, he
evened up losses by playing Monterey.
Owner Lee Rose won a good bit of coin
over the victory of his jumper Baby Bill.
The "Baby" took the jumps like a real
good one yesterday.
It is said Ruinart will hereafter be
trained by Jonnny Wall and carry the
cherry colors of E. A. Mizner, which he
aported in yesterday's race.
Patsy Freeman is not riding in the form
he displayed at Sacramento. Patsy has a
great fad for hug.:ing the rail. 1 Tuis is a
good fault, but will not answer in every
instance, especially with a set of wise
boys ahead of you.
Little AHie Thompson rode a remark
ably good race on Lincoln 11. Very few
youngsters of his age wouid persevere in
hopes of catching an old-timer like Martin
asleep. As U3ual, Martin thought he won.
Instigator ran iike a horse that wouid

or 1.096,156 pounds, having a value of $77,

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1896.
CARDINAL ABOVE
BLUE AND GOLD
Stanford's Freshmen Defeat
Berkeley's at Footr
ball.
An Exciting Kicking Game With
Short Runs and Numer
ous Fumbles.
SCORE FOURTEEN TO FOUR.
Both Universities Join in a Common
Yellâ Opinions of the Two
Captains.
The cardinal waves triumphant over
the Stanford freshmen, and Berkeley's
first-year men are blue and cold. The two
tetms met yesterday afternoon on the
Central Park gridiron field, and, at the
As the Ball Moved.
The opening play is at the top of the diagram, which represents the Central Park gridiron as
viewed from the west Â»:de. Captain Acderson kicks off tor the Berkeley freshmen from the center of
the field down to within fifteen yards of the Stanford freshmen's goal at the Market-nfeet end of the
field, and Captain Murphy catches the ba'l, runs it back three yards and then punts well Into Berkeley
territory, the ball bound! hr to the thirty- Hve-yÂ»rd line bofore It is handled; It Is then run back a few
yards, fumbled and Bully regained by Berkpley on her own forty-five yard line. From that, polut all
the Â»ucc -eding movements of the ball nre exactly indicated and may be followed by Ihe aid of this
exp.nna'.lon of signs: A wavy line InnlcaUs where t'Â»e ball is kicked; a straight Hue where It Is cur
ried: a scalloped line at the en 1 of a wavy linÂ» where it bounds afier a kick: a cluster of small dots
whero It is fumbled; a large dot where it is down with Herkeley in possession: short parallel Hues
where the man with the bill Isforced back or downed back of the rushline: a cross where the ball Is
down with Stanford In possession: a broken line where it is moved by a-.i official.
The initial of the player carryln? or kicking the ball is on the line of its progress, and In a few
instances that of the one making the tackle or downing the ball appears where a notable down occurs.
On Berkeley freshmen plays A stands for Anderson, W for Whipple, Sy for Smythe. Au for Austin,
Al for Allen ami Ma for Masters, and on Stanford freshmen plays M stands for Murphy, D for Daly, L
for Lanagan, S for Scoville, R for Kusk, B for Blanchard, McU for i!cGllvray,McF for McFadden.
end of a savagely fought, interesting game
the score stood 14 to 4 in favor of the boys
from Palo Alto.
lhe same was not perfect football, but
it was spectacular, and there was moTe
punting than was ever before seen in a
match came on this coast. There was also
a good deal of fumbling, and that, too,
made things exciting for those that
watched the vicious scrambles for the
loose ball.
Stanford made one touchdown in the
first half and two in the second before
Berkeley, by a great effort, succeeded in
securing her singie touchdown.
The enthusiasm of the spectators was a
j particularly agreeable feature of the
j match. Both colleges were well repre
j sented in two compact sections seated side
by side, the blue and gold gup porters hav
ing an advantage in numbers, but very
little in the abi-ity to veil. The two var
sity yells and the yells of the opposing
classes were sounded repeatedly and with
all the zest of strong rivalry. Early in the
game the Stanford section guve "three
cheers lor the Berkeley people," who had
just finished sinping a college son*. Soon
after a Berkeley man saw that the com
pliment was returned, and during the in
termission between the halves the parti
sans of both universities joined repeatedly
in a mighty chorus on ibis combination
yell satisfactory to both:
Ha! ha! ha!
California!
Kah! rah!
Stanford!
Coach Cross of Stanford was there beam
ing upon his youthful pupils on the field,
and close by him were Dr. Wood of Stan
iord and the vetpran Frankenheimer, Car
ter, Downing, Harrelson, Code. Walton,
Burnett, Weldonâ of the athletic club
teams â all old Stanford players. And
Coach Butterworth of Berkeley was on
the side lines with knitted brows and '
troubled look, and with him were Mr.
Simmons, his fellow-clubman of Wasbin^
! ton in ante-college days, ana Captain Ran
3ome of Berkeley and little Eddie Sher
mau and Professor Souie and Walter
Mapee and a score of other football cranks
and players from across the bay.
It was the tirst time a Stanford freshman
team had beaten Berkeley's freshmen, and
the wearers of tÂ»ie cardinal went away
happy, forgetting all about their '98 fresh
men that were defeateJ 4 to 0, and their
'99 freshmen that were annihilated under
a score of 44 to 0.
How the game went may be seen in the
accompanying chart,' an explanation to
which is attached.

Captain Anderson's Views.
We lost the game fairly end squarely. The
Stanford men simply outplayed us, and that
is all there is to it. Our men. did not seem
to get down to heavy, telling work until nearly
the close of the last half, and when they did
commence playing it was too late to save us
from defeat. The kicking on both sides was a
marked tcature of tha irame. and in most cÂ»ses
was advantageous. Whipple used good judg
ment in placing his kicks, and sucreid'd in
making several very lone punts. Lanagan,
the Stanford full, also did some clever work
with his kicks, but they were not all placed
with the accuracy that marked \V hippie's.
Both sides jnnde too many fumbles for their
own good. Our siae Buffered the more because
of this fault.
Our team resorted more to line bucking than
the stauford men, and, perhaps, tins was one
reason why we did not make greater pains.
Their team has evidently had more practice
than our eleven, and we fe.t this very sensibly
on several occasions. Taking tlie gama alto
gether it must have been an interesting one
for the spectators, because of the almost con
tinuous movement of the ball and the deter
mination with which most of the men played.
F. P. Anderson,
Captain U. C. freshmen eleven.
Captain Murphy Pleased.
Btanford won because every man played lor
all that was in him. Every fellow went into
the game with the determination of wiping
out that terrible disgrace suffered by the fresh
man class of last year.
We are a:l jubilant over the victory, and I
personally am well pleased with tho way the
Stanford men played. They fought like tigers
from start to flnisfi, and that 1b all that I could
able of them.
We have worked pretty hard during the last
two weeks, and we went into the game only a
little doubtful on account of the light \veiicht
of our line compared with that of the Berkeley
freshmen.
When wo needed a little gain to hold the
ball we made U between the herkeley guards
and tackles. For our longer gams we circled
their cuds. Our ieliows,' interference was
pretty good, though It was ragged at times.
Our men formed their interference a little
more quickly than did the Berkeley backs.
Our opponents 1 slowness in forming interfer
ence made their end rum less effective than
they might have been. . C. MrRPHY.

WILL TRY AGAIN
FOR A CHARTER
Chairman Fitch of the Non-
Partisan Convention
in Haste.
A Strong Desire to Have the
Proposed Instrument
Adopted.
SECIIONS TO BE IXCLTJDED.
The Adoption of the Amendment to
the State Constitution Sim
plifies Matters.
Chairman G. K. Fitch of the Non-Par
tisan convention; W. F. Dohrmann, chair
man of the Merchants' Association, and
Joseph Britton, chairman of the charter
convention, and Mayor-elect Pheian,
chairman of the Charter Association, are
about to take steps during the coming
week to bring together representatives
from the Republican and Democratic par
ties with the view of talcing immediate ac
tion of fifteen freeholders to prepare a
new charter for this City.
So eager are some of these gentlemen to
get a charter for San Francisco that will
cure the many defects of tiie present law
which now governs the people, that con
sultations were held yesterday, from the
tenor of which it is expected that free
holders will be elected within the next
two weeks ar.d the objectionable sections
of the defeated instrument eliminated
therefrom. Then the remodeled charter
will be submitted to the people at a spe
cial election of the voters in this City in
time to pet to Sacramento before .the Leg
islature adjourns in case it should be car
ried here.
The object of this is, as it is claimed, that
at the end of the term for which the in
coming officers have been elected a change
can bo had at the next election by which
this City will be brought under a reorgau
ized system of governm nt.
As it is now one-half of the officials are
county officers and the other mere town
ship subordinates.
Again, by the constitutional amend
ment just carried at the late election,
quite a chanpe will be effected in the fram
ing of the new charter. This is claimed
by several of those who are now so de
sirous to have a law framed for this City.
lhe section jnst amended is as follows:
ARTICLE XI.
Section 8' 2 . It shall be competent in all
charters framed under the auihority given by
section 8 of article XI of this constitution, to
provide in addition to those provisions allow
able by this constitution and by the laws of

PAULSELL IN LUCK.
New Trial Granted by the Supreme
Court Upon Technical Ground*.
W. E. Paulsell, who was convicted be
fore Judge Belcher of robbing Carroll's
faro game on MarKet street about two
years ago, was yesterday granted a new
trial by the Supreme Court. The ground
for granting the new trial is that the trial
court did not properly instruct the jury
concerning; wnat constitutes a reasonable
doubt. The defendant was refused when
he aÂ«ked that the usual instructions be
piven to the jury on this point. The de
cision is in part as follows:
The instruction ought to have been given,
even if the court intended, as is alleged, to say
something further on :he subject. If experi
mental departures from the well-established
language sanctioned by all courts upon the
subject of r?asonnble doubt are to be here al
lowed and eecn trial court is to venture upon,
unusual language to express the idea con
tained in language so often approved, we will
be all oat upon a new and unknown sea. and
compilations will arise in every crimi
nal case coming her<\ which will be very
difficult to unravel. In this oase it is sufficient
to say thnt the court introduced the new and
unusual parase -common-sense," and told the
jury that the case must be based upon that
â¢ â¢ â¢ This phrase is about as uncertain n
any phrase in the language. When one
speaks of common-sense he generally meaiia
his own sense, and there is no warrant for the
unnecessary use of such a term when there is
apt language to express the ide.i ot reasonable
doubt, which has frequently been approved
and pointed out as the lauguage proper to be

Oakland Office Fan Fkakcisco Call,)
- Broadway, Nov. 7. \
Some peculiar incidents in the life of
the late Pbineas M:irsion of Fruitvale
were tokl in Judge Greene's court this
morning and proved sufficient evidence in
his Honor's mind to iusti'y the court in
declaring void the will of the deceased.
Phineas F. Marston died in Fruitvale on
March 21 last. He made his will in July,
1?S8. It bestowed upon the widow all his
- household property and one-fourth of all
the real estate, gave one-third to dece
dent's daughter, Cordelia, one-third to
Frank A. Marston and the remainder to
Frank A. Marston in trust for his elder
son, Phineas Marston. The will made
â¢.no reference to ttw motive which impelled
â¢ the old gentleman to prevent his son
Phineas from managing the property
willed to him.
This morning Phineas Marston, when
.on the witness-stand, told some peculiar
facts connected with Lis father's life, in
support of his petition for the revocation
of the will on the ground that the de
ceased waj cf unsound mind.
The witness said that he never had any
misunderstanding with his father and
that-he was totally at a loss to account for
ilre' restriction placed upon him by his
father. He said there was no doubt that j
the mind of his father at the time of mak
ing the will was unsound. One reason he
gaye was that the decedent for a longtime
hud' been unable to distingush between a j
$5 gold piece and a quarter. His memory
â also' failed him. He was compelled to
teau a thing through three or four times
b"lore he could retain an impression of it.
On one occasion Phineas Marslon took a
hatchet and struck the pet dog of the fam
iiy on the beau ; alter doing this he cut its
throat, and when asked for an explana
tion he replied that he had acted as he did
Ije.cau^e the dog had lived .ong enough.
At another time me witness' father
went to the creek to spear driftwood. Al
though a capitalist decedent was very
frugal. The pole and hook, which he
. usei, fell out of his hand and drifted down
â¢ the- creek. He then went home, har
â¢ nessed tne horse and buggy ar.d drove
down to the baj- :o search for the hook.
Not boding it he renewed his search the
â¢ next day, anii when lie still lailed to find
it exhibited great annoyance. In Septem
ber, INt.i, the old man was declared incom
petent. On tnis showing letters testa
mentary were withdrawn by Judge Greene
and a new administrator will bn appointed.
It was a surprise to the many friends of
Phineas Marston to hear of some ot the
vagaries oi the old man, as it was always
'thought he was a cool-headed, calculating
Ââ  financier. Tne property at Fruitvale is
â¢ valu'.-d at about $15,000, in addition to
which he has a large amount of personal
"property and promissory notes valued at
$20,000.
iiitiraate acquaintances of the deceased
share the opinion that it was simply a
vagary, making any distinction between
the rights of his various children.

ARCHDEACON WEBBER.
BERKELEY. Cal., Nov. 7.â Archdeacon Webber of Boston, Mass., will
begin an eight-ciays : mission in Berkeley with to-morrow's services in St.
Mark's Church. The Archdeacon is one of the most distincuisheu speakers of
the Epi-copal church in America and his visit to the Pacific Coast is for the
purpose of conducting a series of missions in every parish in the State,
beginning with Berkeley. The vestry of St. Mark's Church has rented Shat
tuck Hail for the evening services that will be conducted by the Archdeacon,
beginning with those of to-morrow evening, tnereby arousing much discussion
among Episcopalians of the university town, many of whom declare- that the
holding of the services in an unconsecrated building makes them too much
resemble the "revivals" of other churches, to which Episcopalians are sup
posed to beorposed. "There is a good d*Â»al of difference between a 'revival'
and a mission,'" said the Rev. George E. Swan, rector of St. Mark's Church.
"A revival, a u I understand it, is primarily an appeal to the emotions.
Archdeacon Webber's methods, on the other hand, constitute an appeal to the
conscience through the intellect. The mission is designed to revive Christian
life when it has been allowed to grow cold, nnd instead of the idea of a sudJen
being 'saved,' we rather preach the necessity of an escape from sin bj*an
educational process which affects the whole man and which is a progressive
development of character." Archdeacon Webber arrived in Berkeley to-day.
He is the Archdeacon of the diocese of Milwaukee, though his residence is in
Boston. For many years he has been traveling over the Union as a missionary
of the Episcopal church, and his present visit to California is his second.
After concluding his series of meetings in the university town he will hold
services in San Francisco, Oakland and other cities of California.

GARCELON TRUST VOID.
Merritt Boy* Agree to a Compromise
by Which Kach Benefits.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
'JOS Broadway, November 7. j
An important suit relating to the Garce
lon will was decided this afternoon in the
Superior Court. The suit was Drought by
the heirs of Samuel W. Purrinpton and H.
P. Merritt to have declared forfeited the
Knowles trust. Captain Knowles died
some months ago and Emil Nusbaumer
was appointed his successor. The foun
dation for the suit was the fact that James
P. Merritt had contested the will of Mrs.
Garcelon.
The instrument of trust provided that
the two Merritt boys, James and Fred,
should forfeit their'pronerty if a contest
were made ov6r any disposition of the.
property made in the will.
James Merritt made a contest some
years aso and it was carried to the Su
preme Couit. On this ground suit was
brought. This afternoon judgment was
rendered in favor of plaintiff.
The whole proceedings were the result
of a compromise understanding, and the
various interests that will be received by
the heirs will appear on record in a few
days. By the terms cf compromise the
boys save about three-fourths of the prop
erty, and Emil NusDaumer will continue
to manage the estate for them.
ROADSIDE ELECTION BET,
A Ridiculous Procession That
Went From High Street,
Fruitvale, 10 Fitchburg.
Jack Barracks, a Bryanite, Wore a
McKinley Rooster and Trundled
a Wheelbarrow.
Oakland Office Sa,n Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 7. )
There was a procession on the San
Leandro road this afternoon. A few
weeks ago Jack Barracks, who keeps a
roadside house, became so enthusiastic on
behalf of Mr. Bryan's candidacy that in a
repented moment he declared he would
give any man a free ride from High street
to Fitchburg if his choice were not elected
President.
Joe Gerau, who did not have any politi
cal affiliations of any degree of intensity,
one way or the other, but who is a "sport"
and would Dot sleep peacefully if he
; thought that he had missed an oppor
tunity to accept a bet, immediately picked
up Mr. Barracks' cauntlet.
Election has been held and Barracks is
disappointed. This morning Gerau de
cided that he would like to be conveyed
in a wheelbarrow from High street to
Fitchburg, and as the choice of con
veyances was with him, he decided on. a
wheel baraow, stipulating that a red,
white and blue canopy should be built
over it, that a cushion should be placed in
it and the pictures of McKinley and Ho
bart should be hung on either side of it.
He also required that Barracks, who was
to wheel the barrow, should wear on his
hat a McKinley rooster. The procession
started about 2 o'clock. After the wheel
barrow was a party cf boys with hornÂ«.
Several citizens and ladies in carriages
who Happened to be on the county road
) fell in line and joined in the cheering.
Barracks proved himself equal to the occa
sion; he avowed not a vestige of a white
feather, but manfully trundled his Repub
lican load to Fitchburg, where all hands
refreshed themselves with some of Gerau's
sound money.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1896.
SOME OF THE CLOSING FEATURES OF ALAMEDA COUNTY'S CAMPAIGN.
DRIVEN HOME
AND CLINCHED
How Alameda County Rati
fied the Election of
McKinley.
The Republican Banner Arrived
From Los Angeles and Was
in the Parade.
SOME FAKEWELL ORATORY.
The Banner County Closes the Cam
paign With Tumu'tu us Pgeantry
and Mass-Meeting.
Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 7. J
The nail driven home last Tuesday In
Alameda County was clinched to-nij;ht.
Ihere was a ratification such as Oakland
nevei before witnessed and it was by no
means conlined to the Republicans.
Visitors can always afford to be mag
nanimous and it would be cruel to place
in cold type the names of those who, even
since Tuesday night, have decided that it
is more sensible and certainly more agree
able to get ia out of the wet than to .shiver
in the falling snow.
To a great extent the parade of to-night
resembled that of last Monday in its
salient features, but the spirit of the
paraders was vastly different.
It was a patriotic love feast. Labor and
capital marched side by side and each evi
dently knew and was eager to deraonstiate
the fact that it depended entirely on the
other. The most careful search failed to
reveal the footprints of Mark Hanna on
the laborer's brow. The "coerced" em
ployes from West Oakland took into the
parade the finest float that was in line. It
consisted of an artistic locomotive and
coach, gayly decorated and suitably let
tered.
Behind it marched quite an army of
men, who did not appear to have been
whipped into line or to have marched
from any other motive than that of gen
uine exuberance over Republicanism's
victory.
Oakland has never known a noisier
night. The nearest approach to this even
ing's demonstration is that of lastH^H
day, but on that occasion there was
naturally an element of uncertainty which
no longer exists. Everybody wa? intent
on making a noise, and the unhappiest
boy in town was a little fellow who sat on
a doorstep on Broadway and cried as if
his heart would break because "I ain't got
no horn." Solid business men made
valiant efforts to blow their lungs through
horns, but the most successful effurt in
this direction was that o! a little company
that had built a horn for the occasion. It
was 10 feet long and in the nature of a
â¢{leaking-trumpet. It was placed at a
street corner, and when a leather-lunged
individual yelled into the small end,
'â¢What's the matter with McKinlev? He's
all right," the volume of sound that came
from the other end could be heard several
blocks.
And the roosters! The ordinary rooster
the size of a toy, was looked on with dis
dain, and nothing less than life-size was
au fait. The most common emblem of
victory was a life-size rooster built on a
paper hat, and nearly everybody in the
parade carried some kind of an artificial
crowed
Then the fireworks! The committee of
ten who were appointed two days ago to
collect subscriptions lor uhe parade did
their work well an.i proved such excellent
canvassers that their names should be
carefully preserved for use on future oc
casions, 'i uey inaugurated a new method
of collecting money for patriotic pur
poses. They made up their list beiore
they went on the street, then started out,
notitieJ the leading citizens how much
they were expected to contribute and
wai'.ed until they received it. Buiore mid
night everybody in tho county was aware
of the result of their labors.
That grand old body, the Army and
Navy League, presented a very irupoÂ«ine
front, Durinsr the whole of the campaign
attempts have been made to show that
the veterans were disloyal to the party of
Lincoln, and a certain silver Army and
Navy League was organized by one Dut
ton, who claimed tbat he had IG9 mem
bers. Although they paraded . nearly
every night the average number of men
in line was fifty and Corporal Dutton re
fused to make public the iist of the re
mainder. Now it is believed they had no
existence except in the organizer's imagi
nation. This belief whs borne out to-night
when the genuine league marched hun
dreds strong and were joined by some of
the few who for a time had permitted
themselves to be blinded.
Headed by Grand Marshal Gaskill, the
parade started nearly on time. A cannon,
a steam whistle and wagons from which
fireworks were continuously discharged,
led the way and, after a irorgeous array,
came the feature of the evening â a car
riage drawn by four horses, in the center
of which proudly fluttered the Republi
can banner. Around it were seated Sena
tor Eli Denison. F. J. Fletter. chairman
of the County Committee, Senator-elect
F. S. Stratton nnd the delegation from Los
Angeies, who were charged with the mis
sion of returning the banner to Alameda
Count}'.
There were nine divisions, each under
the charge of the same ai<i that officiated
last Monday. Al! ttie ward Republican
clubs were present, as well as rep
resentations from Mount Eden. Sdeo,
Murray and Washington townships.
Berkeley sent its Republican clubi, and
Alameda Republicans, headed by their
attractive drill corps, were also in line.
The Young Men's Republican League
acted as escort to the veterans ol the
bay cities.
Merchants, lawyers, insurance men, real
estate men atvi clerks each had a place iti
the parade, The Sound Money League
was out in force and prominent in the
first division was that handsome body of
men, the Republican Alliance of Oakland.
The National Republican League and the
various Street Railway Men's Republican
clubs had a divi>ion by themselves. Most
of them wore the uniforms of their re
spective companies, and even an ardent
Popocrat surely could not have thought
there appeared to be lacking an indepen
dence of thought.
The floats and transparencies were all
interesting, some were funny and others
were a trifle personal. But the personal-
I iiy was kept within political bounds and
went no further.
The line of march presented a different
appearance from that which it bore when
the week opened. Something was lack
ing. The huge banner across Broadway,
which contained on one side the head of
the man from Nebraska and the Maine
shipbuilder, and on the other the Ne
braska man with Tom Watson for a mate,
was thoughtfully taken down, it being in
timated that there was a possibility that
the Republican fireworks might impair its
beauty and mar its usefulness, should a
desire to hoist it again exist in 1900. The
gayly decorated fusion headquarters were
quiet as the grave and" as mournful.
"Coin's School of Finance" on Eighth
street, where for three months young Dem
ocrats and old Populists had sat before a
blackboard while they were taught how
fifty-three cents could be made into a dol
lar, was deserted and it is perhaps not
stretching the truth too much to say that
many of its former pupils were joining in
the hurrah on Broadway.

ernacle.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 7.â Never in the
history of Oakland has so much pent-up en
thusiasm been exploded within the limits
of the walls of the Exposition building as
there was to-night. The grent building
was crowded to its utmost capacity with a
wildly hilarious audience, who allow ed
no opportunity to escape to show its feel
ings on the success of McKinley and the
principles for which he stands. Every
conceivable instrument that would ma ke
an ear-spiitting noise was brought into
requisition.

HANGING BY A SWING,
Ghastly Discovery Made by
Mrs. W. E Payne in South
Berkeley.
Her Hmbani Hangs Himself by the
Swing on Which His Little
Girl Amus'd Herself.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 7.â William E.
Payne of South Berkeley banged himself
this morning in the basement of bis resi
dence, using the ropes of a swing he had
made for his little girl to p. ay with.
Tha suicide was due to despondency, the
deceased avinp been out of employment
for some months. He was a compositor
and a member of the San Francisco Typo
graphical Union, and up to the time of
the introduction of linotypes was em
ployed on a Sau Francisco evening news
paper.
This morning the suicide's wife went to
San Francisco on the 9 o'clock train. On
her return she failed to find Mr. Payne at
home, as she expected. After a brief
search she .ound him han^inp in the
cellar, suspended but a few inches above
the ground by the ropes of tha swing on
which his little girl had been wont to
play.
The deceased was a native of New Jer
sey, aged 55 years. He had resided in
Berkeley about eiebt years and was well
known in the south end of the town.
Trie inquest will be held at the late resi
dence of the deceased, on Adeline street,
near Adeline station, at 9 o'clock on Mon
day morning.
Still Holds the Fort.
BERKELEY. Cal., Nov. 7. -Mrs. Mary
A. Tuwnseud, whose efforts to retain pos
session ot the strip ol Shattuck avenue
claimed by her were rela'.ad in Friday's
Call, still remains unmolested in her res
idence, in spite of the fact that a warrant
was issued for her arrest yesterday. The
lady has armed herself with a six-shooter
and declares that she will resist all efforts
to remove her dwelling from the spot it
now occupies. So far none of Berkeley's
officials have served the warrant. A pre
vious charge against her of resisting an
officer was heard this morning in Justice
Lord's court and was postponed for two
weeks.

________ /
Mrs. H. S. Stedbams Able to
Walk After Six Years
of Suffering.
A Beautiful Chrysanthemum After-
noon Weddingâ "Another
Pioneer Gone.
t
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 7.â According
to her ciaim, as a direct result of the
united prayers of the pastors of the Chris
tian churches of (his city last Sunday
morning, Mrs. H. S. Stedhams of 1019
Paru street was enabled to arise and walk
for the first time in six years. This is
what :he lady herself says.
Six years ago she, in company with her
husband, was enjoying a camping trip in
the country. One day a hammock, in
which she was sitting, broke and seriously
injured her spine. She was unable to
walk and had about given up all hopes of
recovering. When seen this afternoon
Miss Stedham?, a sister-ia-law of the
injured lady, said: "The prayer was
answered, we believe, for Mrs. Stedhams
has not been able to walk for all these
years until Sunday. On that day we were
all surprised to see her eet up and walk
downstairs. We could~not account fur
her wonderfnl recovery until we learned
that the ministers had offered a united
prayer for her. We are all grateful for
sucu a blessing that came so unexpect
edly."
A Fashionable Wedding.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 7.â The Fir3t
Presbyterian Church was the scene of the
prettiest wedding this afternoon wit
nessed in Alameda for years. The con
tracting parties were Miss M. Elith New
ton, daughter of the Rev. George Newton
of Portland, Or., and Louis S. Blake,
cashier of Goodall, Perkins & Co.,
San Francisco. The bride has lived in
this city most of her life, and is well
known in the society set. The brides
maids were: Miss May Blake, Miss Flora
Fisher, Miss Josephine Chapman and
Miss Gertrude Peck. They were dressed
with white over yellow, and carried huge
bouquets of chrysanthemums of the same
colors. Miss Sarah Harnden acted as
maid of honor, and carried a bunch of
white roses and maidenhair ferns. She,
too, was dressed in chrysanthemum
colors.
The bride was gowned in a beautiful
white satin dress and carried a bououet of
yeilow Bride's roses and ferns. She was
given away by her father, who escorted
tier to the altar. The groom was attended
by hii brother.
Mr. and Mrs. Blake ieft to-night on a
trip to Southern California. They will re
turn in ten days and take up their resi
dence here.
The church windows were covered and
the gas burning. The waljs were covered
with ferns ar.d palm leaves, besides large
bunches of white chrysanthemums. Every
bouquet was tied with large bands of yel
low satin ribbon.

NO MORE CONVICT STONE
The Affiliated Colleges Must Bs
Constructed of Other
Material.
It Will Be Necessary for the Regents
to Advertise Anew for Bids
for Mascnry.
The Affiliated Colleges of the University
of California will not be constructed of
Foisom granite if Attorney-General Fitz
gerald can prevent it. He has written to
the Board of Regents that he will not ap
prove of the contracts made by the board
with the Rae Building and Contracting
Company for the masonry work because
that contract provides tbut all stone wors
shall be of Folsora granit. As the con
tract cannot be carried out without the
approval of the Attorney-General, his act
will probably compel the Board of Re
gents to proceed to readvertise, and prac
tically begin their work all over.
This is the ooinion of members of the
committee on grounds and building of the
board ol Regents, and a meeting of the
committee will be held l.ext Tuesday
morning at Regent Reinslein's office to
consider what may be done in this
emergency. Attorney-General Fitz:erald
does not confine his utterances on the
issue to his written communication to the
Board of Regents. He said yesterday
afternoon, in an interview, tbat he would
not approve of any contract that may be
made by the regents which involves the
use of Foisom granite, because the State
constitution provides that the labor of
convicts shall not be let out by contract to
any person, copartnership, company or cor
poration.
Attorney-General Fitzgerald also said
teat as a matter of public policy it. was
not well, where there are so many honest
people who have families and who need
work, to permit convict labor to come into
competition with them.
"No, sir," said the Attorney-General, in
answer to a question; "I will not approve
of any contract of that sort, and no con
tract is good without my approval. I do
not know what the Board of Regents will
do in the matter. I have not consulted
with the members. There were several
contracts that came to me from the board,
among them contracts for painting, car
penter work, plumbing and gas-fitting, for
constructural steel and iron work, roofing,
skylights and galvanized iron work and so
on. My communication to the Board of
Regents refers only to the masonry work. " '
The effect of refusing to approve the j
masonry work contract is necessarily to
prevent any woru at present. The plans
which were approved by the reoents
called for the construction of the Affiliated j
Colleges buiidings at a price which prac
tically took all the appropriation made
for the purpose, leaving so small a margin
that the fees of the architects had to be '
provided for in another way.
The fact that the contract., awarded to
the Rae Building and Contracting Com
pany included the use of Foisom granite
caused much comment among the builders
and contractors of the City, and some
protests were heard. Until the letter was
sent out by Attorney-General Fitzgerald
the general public suppose! that the mat
ter was closed. The contracts aggregated
$248,923 and were as follows:
Rae Building and Contracting Com- I
pany, for mason worK, $143,500; D. Ze
linsky, for painting work, $3780; Silas !
Carle, for carpenter work, $67,219; C. 0. I
Sweeney, for plumbing and gas-fitting '
$11,198; Pacific Rolling Mills, for construe- |
tural steel and iron work, $4925; Joseph i
F. Forderer, for roofing, skynghis anii'i
galvanized iron work, $9976; E. J. Lanton I
for heating and ventilating work, $Â»325. i
Concerning the masonry work contract j
the Attorney-General wrote to the board '
as follows:
The first contract mentioned, viz., that be- '
tween the Regents of the University ol Cali- i
fornia and the Rae Buiidiug and Contracting j
Company of fcan Francisco tor masonry work '
contains th- following provisions:
"The contractor agrees â¢ * * to furnish '
the necessary labor and materials â¢" * â¢ re 1
quired, and to i erform and complete in a
workmanlike manner all tbc masonry work of
the Affiliated Colleges buildings of said Uni
versity of California. All stone work to be of
Foisom granite, etc "
This is v direct agreement between the Re
gents of the university and this corporation
that, the stone work of the Affiliated Colleges
buildings shÂ»U be of granite quarried by the
convicts of the Foisom State Prison.
Section (5 ol Article X of our State constitu
tion provides that "the labor of convicts shall
not be let out by contract to any person, co
partnership, company or corporation, and the

Legislature shall, by law, provide for the work
mg of convicts for the benefit of the Stale."
It was the evident intention of the iramers
of our constitmio:i that contractors should
not be allowed to Denefit by convict labor,
either directly or indirectly, and the only
manner in which the Legislature is authorized
to provide by law lor the employment of our
State convicts is "for the benefit of the State.""
Therefore, 1 am of the opinion that a contract
which contemplates the procurement by aeon
tractor of stone quarried by convict labor is
in direct violation of the svirit of this consti
tutional provision. For this reason I cannot
approve the contract in question until that
clause is eliminated.
lam aware that. by section 18 of an act en
titled "An act to regulate and govern the
State prisons of California." approved March
19, 1889 (stats. 18S9, 404-8), the LeeisiMture
provided tha:: "Ail convicts may be employed
by huthority ot tue board of directors under
charge of the wardens respectively and such
skilled foreman as he mny deem necessary in
the performance of work for the State, or in
the manufacture of any article or articles lor
the State, or the manufacture of which Is
sanctioned by law. â¢ â¢ â¢ The board of
directors are hereby authorize.! to purchaso
from time to time such tools, machinery and
materials, and to direct tho employment of
such skilled foremen as may be necessary to
< - arry out the provisions of this section, and
to dispose of the articles manufactured and
not needed by the Stale for cash at private
sale, in such manner as provided by law."
I am cf the opinion, however, that this 'sec
tion doeÂ« not confer upon the Stale Board of
Prison Directors authority to sell to contrac
tors granite quarried by the convicts of Foi
som State Prison, and I am further of thu
opinion lhat any attempt on the part of tho
LoKislHture to confer any such power upon the
State Board of Prison Directors would be un
constitutional.
The masonry work contract was re
turned and the others were held forfur
ther consideration.
JEFFRIES SEEKS A FIGHT.
It Is Probable That He and Van Bua
kirk Will lie Matched.
There are in prospect two big boxing
contests in tblfl City, the first between
Jack McAuliffe and Jimmy Carroll, billed
for November 18 by the St. George Club,
ana the second between Bob Fitzsimrnons
and Tom Sharkey, to be drawn off De
cember 2 under the auspices of the Na
tional Club.
Now there promises to be another match
of no small moment, one between J. J.
Jeffries, the Los Angeles heavv-weipht,
and Theodoie Van Buskirk, who lately
fought a uraw with Jack Stelzner of Chi
cago, the heavy-weight who failed to put
out Middle-weight Harry Peppers.
Van Buskirk was at the Occidental Club
headquarters last night and wanted to
have the articles drawn up then and there,
so that he could sign them at once. To
this the club demurred, as they wished to
learn first when Jeffries is willing to box.
The latter has just recovered from a se
vere attack of pneumonia and probably
will want the date of the match placed as
far in the future as possible.

1314
NIGHT OF CHEAT REJOICING,
The Enthusiasm of the
People Breaks Loose
in the Streets.
A MARCHING ARMY WITH
LIGHTS AND BANNERS.
The Sky Lit Up by Rockets and
the Air Filled With the
Din of Horns.
A FITTING CLIMAX TO ONE OF
THE GREATEST CAMPAIGNS.
The Auditorium Packed With People Who
Applaud a Long Line of Short
Speeches.
One of the most successful political
parades ever arranged on short notice was
that which took place last night in honor j
of the election of McKinley and Hobart as j
President and Vice-President of the United !
States.
The City was alive with Republicans !
and Democrats who rejoiced that the cause j
of sound money and National honor had i
triumphed, and they came forth in bat- j
talions Irom every street, alley and byway
in the City, as if the cause they rejoiced
in had some strange charm, some insidious >
magic that made them come forth and
celebrate the victory.
There wÂ«re many features of the parade
that differed from the characteristics of
the great demonstration of October 3L
The first was like the tramp of an invad
ing army â steady, resolute, anxious and
determined. But the demonstration of
last night was the untrammeled rejoicing
of victors filled with the first flush of vic
tory; the solid satisfaction that comes of
success, and it partook largely of the char
acter of pandemonium at large.
The imposing features of the ratification i
last nipht were seen in the marching of
the trained uniform club 3. In spite of ;
the universal desire to yell like Apaches !
the men in uniform restrained themselves j
to quite decorous and orderly conduct, i
giving vent to their high spirits by the
frequent b'.owing of their torchlights, so i
that the flames shot upward as if in deli- j
ance of all opposition, the lurid lights
gleaming in the faces of many weary fol- I
lowers of Bryan, who viewed the demon- >
stration with wonder, and who wondered
where all the Populists were on election i
day.
The streets were one long blaze of r?d j
fire and Grecian lights while the marching j
victors passed. From hundreds of win- j
dows rejoicing men, women and children |
pave applause as the long line of patriots
filed by.
One striking feature of the post-election !
demonstration was its evident spontaneity, i
People came because moved by an uncon- !
trollable impulse, and their ideas were
often well expressed on the banners they
carried, recorded in terse, nervous words.
Some of these were quite amusing and \
pointed.
One of the striking transparencies read:
"You can't blame Mark Hannafor having
more brains than Jones," and another
asked, "Did Willie find that the vote for
McKinley was coerced ?"
A conspicuous transparency that at
tracted considerable attention and called
forth much enthusiasm ran thus:
POPULAR MAJORITY,
1,800,000.
ALL COERCED.
Following this came a sentiment that
brought forth in plain view the uncanny
crowd that lately filled the air with con
fusion. It ran:
: 4 â¢'â¢ :
SEWELLâ BRYANâ WATSON. :,
â  WHEN SHALL WE THREE MEET AGAIN? â¢
"Wheat went up, but Bryan didn't go,"
was another sentiment that contained
much in little and caught the crowds at
every corner.
Long before 7:30, tha hour announced
for the starting of the parade, there were
evidences df life along the streets. The
clans were forming in every quarter of
tbe City, but some spots were noticeable
chiefly by the absence of life. The Kelly-
Mahoney headquarters in the Flood build
ing were darK and desolate.
As one of that faction's men said, j
"There are no fireworks, no red fire, no
nothing.' The bogus faction in Republi
can politics did not think enough of the
ratification to even attempt to celebrate
McKinley 's victory or mingle their voices
in the universal acclaim.
Attorney T. D. Riordan, mounted on a '
bay charger, was the first of the aids to I
make his appearance. Grand Marshal
Charles F. Curry followed, making an im
posing appearance with a large yellow
sash over his left shoulder, mounted on a
black horse.
After a delay of three quarters of an
hour, which time was occupied in waiting
for ihe arrival of the Union Iron Works
division and the Thirty-fifth Assembly
District Club from the Mission, the grand
marshal was informed that the various di
visions were in place, and awaited his
order to march.
Orders were issued to Corporal of Police
M. Shannahan, who, with light-mounted
troopers, were in waiting to escort the
parade.
The officers mounted and took their
places at tbe head and in front of Grand
Marshal Curry, wLo formed on Post street
with the following aids; W. C. Carpenter
chief aid), A. de la Torre (chief of staff),
Charles Manwarine, J. Alva Watt, Syl
vester Sbaben, C. M. Depew, William
Ross, Fred Frye, E. M. Galvin, I. P. Kin
caid, T. D. Riordan, Dawson Meyer, James
McQuade, Dr. B. F. Fleming and Benja
min f. McKinley.
When the bdgler sounded the advance
the procession started.
The Plumed Knights, a splendid-look
ing body of young men in uniform, com
manded by Captain C. A. Parmalec, had
the right of line. They had a fine band,
to the music of which they marched with
military precision.
The Army and Navy League, with
seventy-five men, commanded by Leon E.
Jones, Assemblyman-elect from the
Thirty-ninth District, followed.
The Railway Club, commanded by W.
Ross, and the Fremont Club, commanded
by Van Morgan, followed, adding about
250 men to the line, which formed the first
division.
The second division was led by the drill
corps of the Thirty-fifth Assembly Dis
trict, with band, commanded by Vernon
F. Northrop, its president and captain.
The drill corps of this club looted splen
did in its dark uniform and gold facings.
It numbered 100 men. all told.
The Spanish - American Republican
League was commanded by Captain E. M.
Galvin, in the absence of A. de la Torre.
The members wore no uniform, but had
yellow sashes over their left shoulders.
They were preceded by a drum corps.
This constituted the second division.
One hundred members as a drum corps,
under the command of George Warmer,
and 200 employes of the Union Iron
Works next came, under the command of
Captain S. H. Love. The Potrero hard
working boys were so elated over the
election of McKinley that they said they
were willing to march all ni^ht in honor
of the great victory won last Tuesday, not
withstanding the "coercion" that "com
pelled" them to parade last Saturday and
also to vote on Tuesday.
The Phoenix Club, that splendid body of
men that did so much to keep up the
enthusiastic organization during the en
tire campaign, headed by its drum corps
and numbering 200 men, made a splendid
appearance. The Bear Club, under com
mand of Captain Barney J. Judge, fol
lowed, carrying the grizzly motto of the
club on its banner. There were eighty
men from this organization in line. They
wore their usual Bear Club uniform and
carried torches.
The Shinglers' Republican Club, under
Captain Joy, fifty strong, brought up the
rear of the line.
The line of march was, commencing on
Post and Stockton, east to Kearny, Kearny
to Pine, east to Montgomery, south to
Market, west to Polk, north to Hayes,
east to Market, east to Taylor, north to
Eddy, to the Auditorium, there disband
ing.
At the junction of Market street and
Golden Gate avenue Grand Marshal Curry
and his aids reviewed the parade. As
each division passed, cheer after cheer was
given for the marshal and his aids.
Many of the paraders went to the Audi
torium to hear the speeches after the
marching was over. It was the feeling of
all participants and the verdict of those
who witnessed the procession that it was
one of the most enthusiastic ever seen in
the City.
Â«.
AT THE AUDITORIUM.
Patriotic Eloquence Raised the Mul
titude to a Climax of Enthusiasm.
The sky was lit by rockets and Roman
candles, the band played the "Star
SDangled Banner," and a great throng
gathered in the Auditorium and yelled and
blew tin horns, and the air pulsated with
the sounds of rejoicing in token of the
election of William McKinley and the
saving of the credit of the Nation. The
occasion was the grand Republican ratifi
cation last evening.
On the stage sat a Bmall army of those
who have been in the thick of the fight for
the past several months, and who figura
tively led the victorious legion over the
ramparts and into the trenches of the foe.
There was Georce Knight and M. M.
Estee and Frank W. Cushmanand Charles
M. Shortrmge and Henry E. Highton and
Colonel Kowalski, Congressman Loud,
Rev. H. J. Calis, I. J. Truman and Theo
dore Reichert
The evening's rejoicings were very prop
erly liegun in song. The California Quar
tet had already improvised some hallelujah
ballads, which were encored by a thousand
whistles and tin horns.
A. G. Booth was the presiding officer
and he came to the point, saying: "Presi
dent Cleveland on the day upon which it
was announced that McKinley was vic
torious issued his proclamation setting
aside Thursday, the 2tith of this month, as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1896.
a day of thanksgiving to the Giver of all
Good for the preservation of this Nation
from threatened dangers. It was very
meet and proper. But we shall not wait
till the 26th, out shall here and now rejoice
and give thanks. In doing so we must
not fail to remember the splendid services,
the sacrifices I may say, of those Demo
crats, who forsoofe their party and joined
with us for the preservation of the in
tegrity of the Nation ior law and for cood
government. They deserve the best that
may be said of them.
George Knight was introduced. Ha
said that in times past there had never
been any room for doubt on the part of
the audience he had had the honor to ad
dress, concerniag his partisanship. In
this campaign, however, he had been at
sea as a partisan. In his travels up and
down the State he had found leading Re
pnblicans making a special point o! say
ing kind things about the Democratic
President, Mr. Cleveland, and standing
ready to hold up his hands in his finan
cial policy. He found Democrats lending
| their beat efforts toward the election of
McKinley and the success of the Republi
can partyâ not as such, but simply that
right might prevail and wrong be tram-
Died under foot.
He paid a strong tribute to the man
agers of the State campaign, the tact and
energy and courage of Hon. Frank Me-
Laugiilin, chairman of the State Commit
tee, particularly. "California has done
nobly," he said; "has planted her feet on
sure ground and fallen in line with the
noble company of States that stand for
law and National honor. To-night the
United States of America feels no shame
upon her brow. The sunshine of a pleas
ing day is before her and she carries your
welfare at her heart." [Great applause.]
M. M. Estee followed : "Wo have won
a great victory," he said, "in a battle in
which we have taken no prisoners and in
which there was no enemy engaged. Now
that it is all over I am sure there will be
few heartburnings. This is not a jollifica
tion of the Republican party, but a
jollification of the people. Mr. McKinley
was the candidate of the people, and he
will be the people's President. The man
who serves his country best, best serves
his party. In this country, 1 wish to say,
we have no classes and no masses. We
are all plain American citizens. My
friends, you have a great responsibility
placed upon you. It is for you to see to it
that law and order are maintained in this
country.
"We have established the dollar of this
country on a sound basis, so that we
know what it is when we get it. "We have
elected a man who is eminently titled to
guide the country Back into paths of secur
ity and prosperity, than whom no other in
the country is better < quipped in State
craft. He is neither an oid man nor a boy,
but in the fullness of his manhood. With
him at the helm we are certain to see a
return of activity in our manufactories
and genera! prosperity."
C. E. Cushman, who was introduced aa
the Abraham Lincoln of the Northwest,
said:
My friends, ladies and gentlemen: [Here
some one shouted "Louder."] I'll key my
voice up in a few minutes, bui I nave left my
voice in a good causo scattered all over the
State. [Applause. J
This is a jollification to-night; not only of
Republicans, bui ol alt good and patriotic citi
zens. In the last four years you have seen the
tree-trade policy go down in ruins. lam glad
to see that those who voted for free trade
showed their good sense this time by voting
lor William McKinley.
Speaking of the party which carried
the banner of free silver he declared that
in his infancy he was taught to say noth
ing unkind of the dead. "Four years
ago," he continued, "they wero out for
free trade. This year they came out for
free silver, and four years from now they
will probably come out for free whisky".
And God knows we would need free
whisky if they had won this election.
The word confidence had been greatly
abused. It was confidence that started
the Genoese navigator on his great voy
age of discovery; it was confidence that
gave Washington his victory at Valley
Forge; it was confidence that gave Grant
his victory at Appomattox; it was con
fidence in McKinlev and protection that
gave the Republicans their great victory."
[Applause.]
After a song by a quartet entitled
"Bryan's in tiie Oold, Cold Ground,"
Colonel Kowalsky spoke. He said never
in the history of the country had the
promise of a party been ao quickly re
deemed as this year. "The election was
held on Tuesday," be added, "ana on
Wednesday the rusty hinges ot the facto
ries that had been closed for many a
month vrere made to creak, and the doors
of these iactories swung open to admit the
workingmen amain."
Congressman E. F. Loud referred to the
efforts of the Bryanites to stir np sec
tional and class feelings and added :
When we find in our own State, be it said to
our shame, our own cliief executive pandering
to even lower feelings we liave cause to be on
our guard. While we have the lower houÂ«e
of Congress we have not got a majority in the
Senate, and we shall not, even with a Repub
lican President and House 01 Representatives
be able to enact any affirmative legislation'
but we s-hall be held responsible for this fail
ure by the masses. We have now a United
Slates Senate which hjis declared that unless
we agree lo enact legislation for the free coin
age of silver at 1G to 1 it would starve thu
country into siibmlss on.
Let us hope that the silver issue has been
buried so deep that it cannot be resurrected
again.
Ellen Coursen Roeckel sang "The Star
spangled Banner," and a double quartet
joined in the chorus.
Charles M. Shortridge, editor of The
Call, was then introduced. He said:
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: The
last time I had the pleasure of being in this
hall addressing a Republican audience I took
occasion then to say that I would iiot in all
probability meet you again until about the
ith or st;i of November, when we would meet
here and whoop it up for McKinley. That was
a prediction that was written in my heart.
I remember that d urine the campaign some
one advised some one else to wear & McKinley
button on his coat and hnve the picture of
Bryan in his heart, but it seems to me that
a great many had the picture of McKinley
both on their coats and in their hearts.
My friends, I might say that I am a middle
of-ihe-road Repuolican. [Applause.] I don't
find it hard at all to keep right along with :he
party. I simply follow the baud-wagon. lam
always sure to wind up right.
He spoKe of a letter which he received
from his mother, who is in Texas, in
which she expressed the fear that McKin
ley might be defeated. In answer to this
he wrote: "I don't think the party
which saved this country is going to for
get it this time; I don't think the people
are going to forget it." Then, comment
ing on this, he said:
And they didVt. And the veterans did not
forget that they could and should and would
rise above party, and vote for country. They
did uo it, and I have the kindest leeliug anu
the highest appreciation lor them.
Tnere is not a man or woman in this audi
ence who does not know that the Republican
party is synonymous with patriotism, protec
tion and everything that goes to make a man
proud of his country.
What a grand old battle we have fought ana
what a grand victory we have won! I tell you,
my friends, that to-night is a night of re
joicing. *
He referred to an address made by him
at the Union League Club, in the course of
which he said it was a disgrace that San
Francisco had not heretofore gone Repub
lican, and declared that if it did not give|a
Republican majority this time he would
swim from the foot pf Market street to
Goat Island, lie continued: "I am proud
of the City, though it gave oniy a small
majority lor McKinley."
He spoke with pride of the 1125 majority
cast for McKinley in Santa Clara County.
"You know what was printed in the
North American fake newspaper," he con
tinued, "which calls itself tue Monarch.
The people were all gome to be bought.
Everybody was going to be bought. They
advised the wearing of a McKiniey badge
and the casting of a vote for Bryan. A
yellow dog would be ashamed of advocat
ing such a course." In conclusion he
said: "1 glory in the triumph of McKin
ley and decency."
J. L. Challess said the Democratic party
was hatched by a selfish hen; that it was
hatched out of selfish interests; it was
created by reason of the presence of the
negro in this country and it desired to
secure the benefit of bis labor without
giving him any compensation for it. The
Republican party, too, wus born by reason
of the presence ot the negro, but it 3 birth
was due to the principles of freedom and
equality to all. He continued :
I want to tay to you that under this dark
â tinâ l want to say to you that in this form
there throbs a heart for the prosperity of this
country that few of you can understand. Give
us a chance to labor w ith our hands; we ask
not for the places of honor and trust. We ask
simply to be given a chance to earn an honest
hviug. We know tliat Lincoln signed the
emancipation proclamation that made the
negro free; we know that he died a martyr
to the principles of his party, and we only
ask to be given the opportunity of filling up
to sume extent the gap made by his death.
11. E. Highton, a sound-money Demo
crat, said:
Fel'.ow-citizevg: You will observe that I do
not say (.enow-Republicans. I am not before
you as a politician, as a party man, but first
and foremost an American. Blood is thicker
than water, and patriotism is thicker tua.i
party.
Thank God, the integrity of our American
Union and the integrity of American insti
tutions are the dearest things to the American
citizen.
Wfcat is to be the result of this contest? It
is to be the prosperity and development of the
business of the country. Business is safe;
prosperity is siife.
Here a song by the California quartet
varied the programme.
A. P. Van Duzer, introduced as one of
the stalwart Republicans of San Fran
cisco, said i.c was glad to see Henry E.
Highton in good company and he hoped
he would always remain on God's side.
Colonel J. H. Roberts in the course of
his rtmarus said that now the mechanic
and laborer will again shake hands with
the capitalist and prosperity will speedily
return.
I. J. Truman spoke of the gratitude due
the workers in the campaign.
Mrs. Addie L. Bailou said: "I was be
ginning to fear that you would think that
this victory was the work of men, and
that the women had no interest in it. But
the women of the homes of the country
wero as much interested aa the men, for
the election of McKinley causes as much
rejoicing among ibe women as among the
men, for they Know their homes will be
happier and more prosperous under the
administration of McKinley."
T. V. Eddy was the last speaker, and
the eveninc's jubilee was closed with the
Bingingof "Glory, Hallelujah. 'J
A BOYCOTT RAISED.
The Emporium Company and Building
Tradea Council Make
Peace.
The boycott of the Building Trades
Council against the Emporium Company
in the Parrott building has been declared
off, all parties having arrived at a satis
factory understanding. Before the store
was opened the council endeavored to
have only' union men employed in the
construction and finishing of the build
ing. A settlement might have been
reached at the time but for the fact that
Charles J. Bruschke had non-union
men in his employ and had several big
contracts, and he declined to make terms
with the union men.
Hence a general boycott was placed
upon the whole building and its occu
pants that has lasted up to the present
time.
At a recent meeting of the council a
committee was appointed to call upon the
Emporium people, with a view of making
a settlement of thelong standingdisagree
ment. The fallowing agreement was pre
pared by the committee, and yesterday it
was signed by O. Feist, president of the
Emporium Company:
Hall of Brn ding Trades Cochch.,)
915' 2 -Mttrket street, V
San Francisco, Nov. 0, 1896. >
We have agreed to- raise the boycott on the
Emporium i.uildiag on the following con
ditions, to wit:'
Firstâ That you will sign an agreement with
us not to employ auy workmen outside of a
union whose union is affliatea with the Build
ing Trades Council.
secondâ That you will not hereafter allow
any firm or individual, as far as it is in your
power, to occupy floor snace, booth or store,
in the Emporium store, upon whom there may
be a boycott by the council.
Thirdâ That you will remove any such firm
or individual now in the Kmporlum stores
providing you can do so without litigation, or
liability for damages whatever.
For Building Trades Councilâ ll. C. Hlncken,
president; A. M. Beach, secretary ; W. M.

A CIGARETTE
COSTS A LIFE
Mrs. E. G. Manley, a
Widow, Sustains Fatal
Injuries.
Her Clothing Catches Fire From
a Stub She Had Been
Smoking.
HER BODY BADLY BURNED-
Neighbors Say She Had Been on a
Debauch for the Past Two or
Three Weeks.
Mrs. K. G. Manley, a widow about 40
years of age, living in a small cottage in
the rear of 14CJJ-2 Buchanan street, was
fatally burned yesterday.
About noon word was received at the
Central police station that a woman had
been terribly burned in the cottage. Po
liceman S. Campbell was sent out and he
immediately summoned the ambulance
and had her removed to the Receiving
Hospital.
When Campbell reached the house he
found- Mrs. Manley seated in a chair in
her bedroom, with her clothes burned al
most to ashes. Hardly a part of her body
had escaped being burne/i. Some neigh
bors had put out the flames before the po
, liceman arrived.
From what Campbell was able to learn
Mrs. Manley had been on a debauch for
the past two or three weeks, which ren
dered her almost incapable of knowing
what she was doing. She was ; n receipt
of an income from her deceased husband's
estate which kept her in comfortable cir
cumstances. She nas a sister in business
on Haigbt street, near the i>arK.
As she was addicted to cigarette-smok
ing it is supposed that she had been in
dulging her propensity and a live cigar
ette had fallen among her clothes and set
fire to them. In her maudlin condition
she was unable to do anything to sav^
herself, but her screams attracted the at
tention of her neighbors, who hastened to
her assistance.
At the Receiving Hospital Dr. Bunnell
found that she was seriously burned on
both legs and hips, abiomen, chest, back
and right arm. Everything possible was
done to alleviate her sufferings, but the
doctor expressed the opinion that her
chances of recovery were very doubtful.
Mrs. Manley was not unconscious, but
she was vÂ«>ry reluctant to say anything
about nerselfor what led to the accident.
"My husband has been dead several
years," she paid, "and my friends are
well-to-do people. My sister is in business
on Haight street, near the park, but I
don't want her to know anything about
this accident, and I hope she will never
know, as it would be a disgrace to her
and my other friends."
Being pressed to say how the accident
occurred, she said: "I was making some
toast for Tom and I suppose my dress
caught fire." She declined to say who
Tom was, but finally said his name was
Tom Williams, a shoemaker on Jones
street, near Bush, who roomed in her
cottace.
Amid her pain she constantly pleaded
for a cigarette, as she was dying for a
smoke.
Mrs. Manley died last night shortly
after midnight.
WILLIAM MOOSER'S DEATH
Pascinc Away of the Pioneer Architect
Who Drew the Plans of the State
Capitol.
William Mooser, the pioneer architect
of this City, passed away early yesterday
morning. His death leaves mourners on
ail sides, in his family and in business
circles. Mr. Mooser arrived here October
10, 1854. when tents were more in use than j
were wooden building?, and the young ;
man followed the example of the others, |
and put out lor the minea. In 1858 he re- !
turned and entered upon the pursuit ot i
his profession. The first building lie de
signed now stands on Third street, op- i
posite South Park. Labor was very scarce '
and the price of bricks was very hign. j
The owner of tte building was short of I
money, and Mr. Mooser not only fur- j
nished the capital, but made the bricks I
and did the carpenter and mason work
himself.
Architect Mooser has many monuments I
that will perpetuate nis memory on both
sides of the bay. In this City there is the
French Hospital, and in Oakland is the
Macdonough Ther.ter, two of the master
pieces that will hand the name of the de
ceased down to posterity.
As early as 1860 William Mooser made
the first complete map of this City and
Alameda County. He likewise drew tbe
plans of the State Capitol at Sacramento. !
Tried to Cut His Throat.
W. C. Ehrenpfort, 926 Eddy street, was
taken to the Receiving Hospital last evening
to have a slight wound in his throat Rtitched I
and dressed. He had been drinking heavily
for some time, and in a fit of despondency
drew his penknife across his throat. After the
wound was dressed he was locked up Iv the
City Prison on a charge of drunkenness.

The most beautiful university site on
earth is at Berkeley. The generosity of
Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, and the exDectation
.of very large things for the benefit of the
University of California, as foreshadowed,
have made that institution the center of
attention among the educational institu
tions . and educational men the world
.ever. Theie, on tiie grounds now only
partly improved, but naturally beautiful,
there is a certainty that a "new-born Ox
ford" will in ihe prophetic words of
.Trmothy Dwight, written a little over one
hundred years ago, "cheer the "evening
Ekies."
Crowned with the glories of the best of
modern architecture, blossoming into
" g*eat flowery acres and stretching away
in . undulating masses of greenery from
the foot of the sheltering and lofty range
of hills on the east to their western,
â southern and northern boundaries, the
elopes' within the present inclosed area
will be- visited in the future by thousands
'and tens of thousands annually who will ,
. rind Berkeley as much of an educational
Mecca as Yale or Harvard, as Oxford or
Cambridge.
The architectural plan, as a whole, has
â¢ not been formed, nor even conceived.
Clusters of educational structures in va
rious centers of learning will be studied
and carefully considered, the initial step
in that direction having been already
taken. These buildings will be admired,
.but never will receive or deserve the at
tention which instinctively centers on that
great area of hundreds of acres which
:'-onts and surrounds the university on
t very side.
Considered purely from the picturesque
point of view, the environments of the
University of California are remarkable in
every, way, and the purpose of this article
is. to consider them from that aspect alone.
Students in institutions of learning in
other parts of the world must find cause
to wonder at details which could belong to
no other part of the world, nor to any
other university.
Roughly estimated, that part of the
area which is more or less used, contig
uous to the university buildings or ap
pertaining to the approaches from the
west, south, and north, embraces about 250
â¢ acres' of fine fertile land, which almost
spontaneously becomes a wild flower
garden after the rains, from end to end.
.-Willingly and with little urging, it gives
vigorous life and sustenance to plants,
Bh'rubs and trees gathered from all parts
of the. earth.
â¢The western windows of the university
".look out toward the illuminated ocean
ajerl catch the sheen of the wonderful bay
of San Francisco. The vegetation of the
'serui-tropics grows almost spontaneously,
fronds and good green limb, in sheltered
vales among the gently rounded and
rriound-lifce hills. East of the university
buildings the bills rise grandly, varie
gaud by canyons. There being given the
finest, natural landscape in California, the
best possible climatic conditions to favor
â¢ the growth and full development of vege
tation, sufficient money to supply skilled
labor and water without limit, the natural
'Jay of the land to render the toil
and plans of the landscape gardener
most effective, and the desire to make of
the grounds the most attractive of any

VOICES OF NATURE
Whatever the result of the election has
been it h evident that November is doing j
buM nf sÂ« on a gold basis.
.What floods of it she has been pouring
but over hill and valley and bay. At no
other season, it seems to me, is there this
T>ure golden quality to the sunlight. The
bare brown tills tane on warm tinges
from it. The tender young grass just
showing its blades reflects it back and
streams over the meadows with a vivid
glow as of yellowish-green fire. Where
lessthan a week ago the early October
ra.ins washed a sheet of thick mud Irom
the hills above the jÂ»ung grass stands an
Inch high.
I foui-.d a tiny poppy this week rallying
to November's gold standard, and the
Oregon juncas have been twittering about
for riea-riy a fortnight. They came down
turn the north for the campaign, bring
â u.' their bright-yellow biiis wit', them.
â Vould there were no more dubious cam
pÂ«J-n bills than these!
Up in the woods the golden sunlight
has touched leaves and grasses into ex
quisite autumnal beauty. It is different
from the lender, hesitant loveliness of
spring, mellow and mature, with a hint !
not of sadness, but of sober quiet in the [
university area on earth, and it wili be
apparent that tne possibilities in store
can be only imagined. In a word, here is
something now unique in university en
vironment and sure to become the wonder
and talk of educated tourists within the
period of a comparatively few years.
At this time the quest which was made
for the most picturesque site in all Cali
fornia for the university takes on new
interest, for the era of further develop
ment has begun, and to the claims of
nature the blandishments of art will be
added.
John B. Felton, pronouncing'services in
memory of Professor Durant in February,
1875, described the discovery of Berkeley
as the ideal site for the university, as
follows:
I . "A few years aeo,with many years in Cal
ifornia experience, .
Mr. Durant set out t^^^^^^^^^^^H
with some friends to |H
seek a place where H
learning might find a I
permanent home on I
our Pacific sbore. He I
passed in review I
many of the most I
beautiful valleys in I
our State, so rich in I
landscapes that de- \ H

gladden and ennoble H
the heart One by I
one he rejected sites I
full of beauty, for in I
his mind there was I
an ideal spot where I
nature would present H
itself in her loveliest I
form to the young I
student, and lead I
him by her display I
of outward beauty to I
an appreciation of all I
that is good or beau- I
tiful in the winter I
world of the heart I
or mind.
"One morning in I
spring, when the air. I
purified by the rains I
of winter, brought I
out in clear relief the I
lines of ' ocean, val- I
ley, hill and moun- I
tain, when the trees I
were budding and I
the turf was green, I
and a vague, dark I
spot in the sunlight I
â the Farallon I
Islands â showed I
itself through the I
Golden Gate, he I
.passed through fields I
unbroken by roads, I
untrodden by man, I
and came to the pres- I
ent site of Berkeley. I
" 'Eureka!' he ex
claimed, 'I have found it.'
"Below him stretched the great bay of
San Francisco, where ships take on their
cargo and pa.-s tdrough trie narrow straits
to the broad ocean. Beautiful trees and
foliage coveied the wrinkles of the moun
tains, hollowed by the descending winter
rains, and seemed like those soft irreen
spots that spring up in the mind in the
air, as though nature were in a retrospec
tive mood. One can fancy her taking ac
count of the year in these golden days
with a certain sense of snug camfort.
Mother Nature is such a good house
keeper. I know that she las made ample
preparation for the morrow. The little
wake-robins and Solomon's peals, the
parsleys, buttercups and poppies are all
snugly tucked to bed until the v inter
slumber time is over, and I am sure she
will give encouragement to no more pre
cocious poppies who have no call
to be sitting up so late. This is the
grown-up's season. The gray - headed
dandelions, the silver- crowned grease
wood, the sun-touched foliage and leafless
trees and shrubs are having their say now.
Just here, where some minute spring
keeps this clayey bank wet and glisten
ing, a bee has alighted upon the wet
earth. Bee blossoms ure scarce these days
and the bees are forced to fly far afield in
search of sweets. We Bee tl:era occasion

give a thought to the question of whence
they come? Their appearance in the city

"And rising calmly
from the sunlit bay

ascended gently at
first and then more
abruptly till it be
came a ruffled storm

then disappeared in
the sky. As he gazed
upon the glowing

that he bad found

When Henry Du
rant gazed in rapture
at the landscape the
old Spanish families
held tracts of lands
which in extent were
equal to a princi
pality. These tracts
were bounded by a
white ribbon of beach
on the west and by
aspiring hills on the
east. Over all the
domain grew oak
trees, perennially
green, with silvery
gray trunks, with
gnarled, fantastic
and wide - reaching
limbs, under which
sleek cattle sought
shelter when the
noontide heat was
fervid. The swarthy
vaquero, silhouetted
against toe far back
ground of the Golden
Gate, galloped across
the view like a dream
figure. Houses there
were none to ob
struct the view on all
the immense slope
which extended west

of the madrone, the
manzanita and the bay tree answered
the shouts of riders and the low
ing and trampling of herds. Con

alien to city life. Bees will live near us
unless they take a notion to do otherwise,
but they can never be domesticated. The
bee is a creature of the woods, and almost
any springtime the nomadic instinct that
has lain dormant through countless gene
rations may awaken in a whole hiveful of
the insects and send them swarmintr off to
the sylvan environment that is theirs by
rieht.
Whatever brought this bee to the clayey
bank his mission is evidently fulfilled.
Perhaps he was only drinking. Perhaps
I the ciay afforded some sweet drop for the
i honey lover. At all events, he is home-
I ward bound now, for he rises in the air
j and takes a beeiine for â why, bless us, not
i for the hive* in the garden about the
ranchhouse a half mile below, but straight
into the deeper wood.
"Must be a bee tree in the woods," says
my companion, and then we regard each
other wistfully, and the same query rises
to each pair of Jips, "Are you very tired?"
Who could feel faticue with a bee tree
within a radius of a few miles.
At last we were able to decide as to the
general direction in which the tree must
li<s. The question was to follow up th*> bee
line until we should come to it, and in a
very few minutes after that an unbroken,
busy line was established.
Our next move was more cautiously
made. Field glass in hand I follow d the
line as far as I could across an open glade.
I lost them twice, once by stumbling over
a fallen log, to the detriment of Knees and
elbows. Contact with mother earth
brought a certain feeling that the wild
goose chase or the proverbial search for a
needle in a haystack were plain sailing
compared tX> this crazy flight after a
homing bee. But when that bee's home
is a tree, all that I had read or heard
about bee trees parsed through my mind,
tiring my imagination and rousing enthu
siasm to white heat. I scrambled up and
rushed on as I caught sight of another
PROPHETIC POEM By TIMOTHY DWIGHT.
[written in 17&4.]
All hail ! Thou western world, by Heaven designed.
The example bright to renovate mankind!
Soon shall thy sons across the mainland roam
And claim on far Pacific's shore a home.
Their rule, religion, manners, arts convey
And spread their freedom to the Asian Sea.
Towns, cities, fanes, shall raise their towering pride,
Proud commerce's mole the western surges lave
The long, white spire be imaged on the wave.
Where marshes teemed with death shall meads unfold.
Untrodden cliffs resign their stores of gold.
Where slept perennial night shall science rise
And new-born Oxfords cheer the evening skies.
"THE OAKS," AT BERKELEY.
IN THE BOTANIC GARDEN.
days" being in lancy's view, the desire of
Henry Durant to lead students "by na
ture's display of outward beauty to an ap
preciation of all that is good or beautiful
in the inner world of the heart or mind"
seems in consonance with the entire pic
ture, historical and real. There is nothing
more romantic in the history of Oxford or
fleeing insect high above my head. The
treetops shut out the sky and I could see
the b?es no longer, so I signaled to my
fellow-hunter, who presently came up
with the portable bee garden. Our cap
tives being liberated Mew straight up
above the treetops and disappeared. "No
us<Â»," I said, as I watched the sky for their
return; "we cannot track them above the
trees." She looked at me reproachfully.
''0 coward heart, be still," she quoted.
"Verily, I came not forth save to find a
bee tree, and 1 feel it in my bones that we
shall see one this afternoon."
Even as she spoke a bee came back. We
could not be very far away from head
quarters. Courage! We may be happyyet!
But the search had but just begun.
Backward and forward among the trees;
to the right, to the left, but in an ever
narrowing circle, we carried our saucer of
sugar. Tal* of patience! The way the
bees pursued that peripatetic garden of
sweets shamed our haste.
The afternoon was wearing to a close,
and judging from the directions taken by
the bees we must have parsed thateiusive
tree half a dozen times. The bees came
and went constantly, and moving the
sugar seemed to make very little differ
ence in the numbers that hovered over it.
"We shall scarcely get home before
dark, now," my companion said, "and 1
am tired out, now." This wUtt a little
laugh of apology as she leaned against a
tree.
The laugh gave way to a look first of
surprise then of alarm, and then with a
great shou* she grasped my arm, pointing
toward the tree beside us. ''Here! Here
it is!" she cried, excitedly.
"Where?". 1 asked, nothine doubting
but that she had been stung. "I'll find
some wormwood leaves and bind on it."
"Wormwood what? Are you crazy?
Stung? Oh, pshaw. Can't you see? This
is the tree. The bee tree. It's been here
all the time."

While somewhat
foreign to the pur
pose of this article,
but to add a pictur
esque touch of an
other kind, a homely
narrative made by
Henry Durant, show
ing how the univer
sity which occupies
the most beautiful of
university sites had
its actual beginning
is given here. The
story is taken from
William Carey Jones'
"Illustrated History
of the University of
California" : "I be
gan it with three
pupils in a building
which I hired for
$130 a month, to be
paid in gold coin
monthly, in advance;
to be occupied by a
man and wife, whose
wages were $150 n
month, to be paid in
the same way. The
school increased a
little during the first
two months and a
half, but the income
was not sufficient to
meet expenses, and
my housekeepers â
Quinn was the man's
name âhe and his
wife, not having re
ceived the entire pay
for that term, began
to be alarmed.
"He said that what
ever did not succeed
in two months and
a half in California
never would succeed.
He could not trust
me any longer. One
morning I went up
stairs as usual to my
school. It got to be time for luncheon and
I went downstairs and found nothing pre
pared. Quinn had squatted on the lower
floor and put out his shingle:
: Lodg.'K and boarders wanted here. â¢
Drinks for sale at che bar-
"Certainly, that tree has been here ever
since we have. At least, I'm sure I did
not put it there," I replied.
''.But, don't yon see, it's tne bee tree";
and as I still stared stupidly at the big
trunk before us she suddenly seized me
and laid my head ciose against the bark.
"Listen !" she cried.
A rumbling roar, as of a north wind
through the eucalyptus trees on a dark
night, seemed to come directly from the
heart of the tree. We had been for fully
an hour within a radius of twenty-five feet
of this big, hollow tree; but we might
have gone home in ignorance of its where
abouts but for this accident.
It all came of our not allowing for the
limitations of a creature in whom instinct
is stronger than reason. Each bee, as it
sipped its fill, rose above the treetops,
circled an instant to get its bearings and
then dropped to the tree at the foot of
which it had gathered its burden. I can
only account for this by supposing that
the bees are more familiar with the ap
pearance of their home tree from a bird's
point of view than from the ground. The
creature had to rise above it in order to
know it. Certainly it would have been
far easier to fly in a direct line from the
sugar to the storehouse entrance. That is
what reason would do. But would reason
ever learn to distinguish one tree in the
forest from the appearance of its tip amid
a hundred others? We could not even,
looking down, as I have often done, from a
height, upon a dense growth of timber,
satisfy ourselves as to the identity of a
single familiar tree. To this day I cannot
from the ferry-boat's deck be certain
which of the hills ranging before me in
the distance is the particular one familiar
to me as my right hand where our bee
tree ia growing.
But the bees evidently found the longest
wav 'round the shortest way home, and
we could distinctly see them pouring in
and out of a hole, evidently once a wood
"Ho got up a barroom with his bottles
in it. I sent out to a restaurant and got a
luncheon for the boys. Then I went to a
lawyer and entered a coroDlaint before a
police court extemporized for that occa
sion. Quinn was ordered to appear. He
was found guilty of getting up a nuisance
'and was fined $5 and ordered to desist.
Meanwhile I went up to clear out his
fixings.
'â¢He camo t>p and wanted to know what
I was about. I told him what 1 was going
to do. He told me to desist. I told him
that I had made a beginning, and was not
going to stop until I had made an end of
it. He got into a rage, laid his hands on
me with considerable force and was push
ing me away, when suddenly he became
as pale as a cloth, lifted hishandsoverhis
bead and began to pray.H
"He begged that I
would pray that God
would have mercy
on his soul. His
religion came to my
relief. He had an
impression that he
had laid hands on a
consecrated person,
and thought that he
was committing the
unpardonable sin.
He told me I need
not trouble myself to
move the thing3 â he
would do it."
University sites
generally are com
paratively uninter
esting. Yule Uni
versity is in the
center of the city of
New Haven, and
while the grounds
and buildings are
bounded on one side
by the historic New
Haven "Green," or
common, fringed
with large elms, it
has only a view of
streets and business
blocks. The elms
are beautiful, but
comparatively few,
and the area occupied
is small. Harvard
University has larger
grounds, but is
equally devoid of
landscape. Brown
University at Provi
dence, R. L, Wes
leyan and Trinity
in Connecticut â
these have wider
views, the first look
ing out on Narra
gansett Bay, and the
other two on the
winding Connecticut
River. West Point
is the best situated of Eastern in
stitutions for picturesqueness upon the
broad Hudson. Among the State or
privately conducted universities the
University of Wisconsin is considered
to be scenically favored, leading out on
two lakes and variegated lands. The fa
mous English universities, Oxford and
Cambridge, have very good locations, oue

pecker's front door, well up in the trunk,
where a great branch thrust ont. The buz
zing of those about the sugar had misled
us as to the source of the sound that came
from the tree.
Honey is not to us moderns what it was
to the ancients. We grown upp do not rind
it, now, what it was to our childish palate,
albeit we do not despise it when it appears
in company with its hereditary compan
ions, griddle-cakes and waffles.
But it belongs to the childhood of the
world, and we upon whom it has cloyed
have only lelt to us the subtler joy
of tindine a bee tree. There are those wuo,
finding it, pillage its sweets for no other
reason, that I can determine, than because
the honey is there and can be taken. The
woods that cover the mountains in South
ern California hide many bee trees and I
have known a party of campers to cut one
down that they might taste the sweets that
none cared enoueh for to bring away. It
always seems to me that the people who
yield to such an impulse as this have
much in common with the man who shot
the last great auk.
We wandered about the bee tree, gloat
being on a low ridge between the rivers
Thames and Isis, as it is locally known,
and the Cherwell, the other being on the
Cam.
Compared with the possibilities inherent
in the lordly domain of the University of
California, these famous old university
sites are uninteresting. The towers and
spires of Oxford, numerous and yet varied
in character, the quadrangles, old and
new, with their profusion o f carved stone
work, historically and architecturally in
teresting, may not hold their superiority
above the buildings to rise at Berkeley for
many years more, and they cut no figure
in this consideration. The accessory
charms of groves and avenues of trees,
quiet college gardens and well-watered
valleys, which please the eye of the Ox
ford student have no better chance to re
tain a claim for superiority.
The accompanying pictures show rather
hints of the beauty which it is possible to
add to ihe university grounds at Berkeley
than realize in any full degree what can
and will be accomplished. The scenes
where nature appears to be enthroned,
especially in the vicinity of Strawberry
Creek and Strawberry Creek Canyon are
sufficiently picturesque to drawannuaKy
a large number of artists to them. It goes
with the saying that there is nothing in
any other university inciosure which can
for a moment compare with these natural
pictures.
Under the overhanging and overarching
trees of native growth, the creek sings and
runs along in devious and pleasing ways,
with "many a tiny water break above the
golden gravel," as Tennyson says. The
pictures show it in one of its most pleas
ing moods. Under the shade of the clus
ter of great oaks not far from the western
boundary of the university is a scene of
unsurpassed beauty. Not the elms of Yale
are more picturesque.
There are large groves in various parta
of the inciosure. Here, seated comforta
bly on benches, spectators gaze enraptured
at the wonderful vista of the Pacific and
the beautiful mountains and hills on the
shores of Marin, San Francisco and San
Mateo counties. Or if they wish they can
in a moment plunge deeper into tte
woods, hear the wild birds cry and be
near the very heart of nature.
There are already botonical and ex
perimental gardens, an orchard of
deciduous fruits to please the eye
with their green, and an orchard
of olive trees, pranked out in silvery gray
foliage. There are huge sentry lines of
conifers, which shut out the west wind,
and are imposing in their towering height,

A Man of Feeling
It was certainly one of the most unpleasant things I had ever had to
do, and there were a good many unpleasant things to be done by a man in
my position during those stormy years; in fact, 1 do not think I am going
beyond the mark if 1 say that I was the pivot of the whole unhappy con
cern. There were moments, of course, when I felt the importance of my
position, and there were yet other moments â still more frequent â when I
enjoyed the amplitude of my salary. But you must remember that lam
a man of feeling, and it could not but be painful for a man of that kind to
be the immediate instrument of death to so many unfortunate people. Of
course one got used to it. Most of the brave people who died during those
years were polite enough to make things pleasant for me, and I was always
as amiable as I could be to them. Ah! they died well, those ladies and
gentlemen ! With all our revolutions we have had none since like them.
They would mount my scaffold with all the air of people entering a
salon for a pay party, and then they would make me their bows and they
would engasre me in a pleasant conversation; and if I was, unfortunately,
compelled to interrupt them by a reminder of my other engagnments f
they would consent in the most reasonable manner to adjourn the talk to
another and more remote scene. It was the rarest thing in tne world for
me to have to use any force. Most of them would allow me to pinion
them, and would then save me all further trouble by laying themselves
quietly on the plank, for all tne world as if they were composing them
selves for sleep. And then I would touch my spring, and the great white
blade would descend quickly, and before another minute was out the
whole thing wouid be over, and both my victim and I would part from
one another with a most pleasant sense of haying spent an agreeable
minute.
It is true that sometimes there would be no time for conversation.
The Tribunal was often most inconsiderate, and the Public Prosecutor
became a very rapid gentleman toward the end of that time. My first
big catch came from that body of gentlemen who called themselves the
"Gridirons." Fine fellows those, and never a murmur did I hear from
their lips â as considerate to me as if I was doing them the greatest favor
in the world. But lam wandering â I must back to my tale. lam get
ting old, and age is garrulous.
I said that few of them struggled. But Camille Desmoulins was no
ordinary man. Some fools have called him a coward because he would
not keep still in the cart, but I will stake my soul teat there wa3 no look
ot fear in his face when he came to me. It was just anarer â mere blind
fury. He felt himself caught, I think, in a sort of trap. Poor young fel
low ! I ieit quite sorry that he should have fallen into my hands, though,
as I say, I always made the business as pleasant as I could. But he was
very young, and, in his stiuggles, as he was coming along, he had
wriggled so as to get his arms out of the ropes that bound them and his
jacket had worked itself right off, and his shirt was torn in numbers of
places. The ropes twisted and he was suffering acutely, as I could see.
That great, shaj-gy villain, Danton, was standing next to him in the cartÂ»
and I saw that he was upbraiding him.
"Why mind them?" I heard him say. "That wretched scumâ Laissex
la cette vile canaille."
It is wondir:ul what a useful and interesting place mine was for ob
serving men's characters, and, though I do not like to say it of a brave
man, even Danton quailed a little as he put his first foot on my elegant
staircase. I heard nis words, and they rang through me in a curious
manner; for I could not help thinking of my own Charlotte and the little
ones at homeâ a reflection natural to a man of feeling. He paused as he
placed his foot on the lowest step and turned round to look back at the
people. And then a sort of spasm passed over his great face, and it
seemed almost as if he thought of struggling against fateâ of turning like
some greet lion to rend the cowardly wretches behind him. He tossed
his head back, and his great shaggy head of hair was lite the mane of a
lion.
With a rapid changeâ as if he realized in a moment the hopelessness
of his tnoughts â hiÃ head sank and he almost tottered on the step. And
then it was that I heard that cry of dis which touched me so, 'Oh, my
wife, my beloved, I shall never see thee more!" But it was only fo~ a
moment. TLe ereat lion pulled himself together immediately afterward,
and I heard him nay to himself as lie mounted the stairs with a strong
stepâ many others heard it alsoâ "Danton, no weakness." And then he
submitted himself to my pinioning with the most agreeable politeness,
and turning to the people smiled bis great farewell, as if he were about to
step into one of those wineshops that he loved so well.
"Show my head to the people" â those were his last words to me
"Show my head to the people, it is worth while; they do not see the like
every day."
Other listeners heard these sayings and have repeated them; but I
was nearer to him than any other, and heard them the most clearly.
Camille came next. As he mounted my stairs with his torn shirt and
his poor bleeding arm, he seemed dumb with a sort of impotent fury. I
was sorry for the poor fellow; for I once knew what- it was to â  be young
myself, and life was very sweet then. Besides, it was so short a lime since
that he bad been one of the most successful and brilliant men in Franceâ
the beloved of the people, the hero of the Palais Royal, the accepted bride
groom of Lucile Duplessis, and an accomplished litterateur and journalist.
It had been but a few days since all this had changed, and I could see that
he was still dazed with the shock of his sadden fall. So 1 laid myself out
to be as polite as possible to the excellent young m an in his last few min
utes. '- ,\.V ". â¢ -.". .',; ':"â - : â  'â  :
"Allow me," I said, "to replace Citizen Camille's coat; I fear that the
rope has impeded him."
He looked up with a shrue of surprise as it astonished to meet with
politeness in such a place. That was unreasonable of h.m, for I always
prided myself on the perfection of manners that prevailed on that plat
form. He turned round and allowed me to untie his hands and replace
his coat.
"It seems a small matter," I said; "but it is well to do these things
elegantly."
During these years my society was so much among the refined and
elegant that I bad picked up a very nice sense of taste and decorum, which
I have since lost in my unfortunate poverty, l was relieved when the
youiiL' man's silence broke â
"Thanks, my good fellow," he said; "thanks, my good fellow. I bear
you no prudge."
That was pleasantly said, and it helped to ease matters between us.
"Mine," I said, "is an honorable function. lam the concierge of the
Unknown."
Camille smiled. He liked to hear a pretty phrase. He could make
them himself, even better than I.
"You keep up your spirits," he said.
"Why not?" I replied. "I am engaged iv a work of cure that need
not be repeated."
"True, true," he said, and there seemed to be a deep ring in his voice
as he spoke.
1 hardly liked to interrupt so pleasant a conversationâ one of the most
pleasant that I can remember in the many talks I have had with eminent
men. But time was pressing, and there were many ochers waiting for
their interview with me. My anteroom â as one of our Emperor's min
isters might put itâ was crowded; so by a gentle turn of the hand I inti
mated to Caniiile that if he was ready it would be convenient for me to
proceed.
And then it wa3 that the pood fellow took advantage of my friendli
.ness to lay on me the task which I have already referred to as being the
least pleasant I had ever had to perform. He looked at me for a minute
as if gauging my worth, and then, as if satisfied, he said without moving:
"As you have a kind heart, my good fellow, do one small thing for me."
I was a busy man in those days and had made a rule of refusing to
carry out the requests of the gentlemen who visited me on that platform.
This may seem hard-hearted, but you will understand that at such a mo
ment most men have a last message to give or a last memorial to leave,
and ii I had once made myself into a handy porter for these things I
should have no time for my real work.
But in this case the man's plight touched me. He was leaving behind
him a young wife and a young child, and I knew what that meant. So I
parleyed with himâ weakly, you will say; but I repeat that I am a man
ot feeling.
"The citizen will understand," I said, "that such a course is most
unusual. I may be the concierge of the next world, but lam not a porter
in this." v
Camille did not smile at my joke this time. He leaned forward
toward me, and addressed me in the most pathetic tones.
"For pity's sake," he cried, "do this for me ! It is but a small service
for a dying man. Round my neck hangs a locketâ a locket with my
wife's hair in it. I should have hidden it from these scoundrels, but I
have been so closely watched that I could do nothing. Unfasten it and
take it this evening to my wife's mother, Citizeness Duplessis. She will
keep it and give it to my wife whenâ when that is possible."
He was so earnest and impassioned, and the crowd were getting so
impatient at tbe delay, that I thought the easiest way would be to assent,
knew what the poor man meant. He had probably heard that after
noonâl conjectured from what 1 knewâ that his wife had taken his place
in prison. Well, it is a sad world, and I should not like to think that I
increased tbe sorrow of it; and so I took the locket and put it in my
pocket, and I hud no further trouble with him.
It was not until after I had finished my work that afternoon that it
came on me in a flash that I had forgotten to ask the Citizen Duplessis'
address. How was Ito execute my errand? Of course it would be an
easy thing not to do it, and a voice whispered to me t:;at the locket might
fetch a very decent price.
But though I do not say that I have not sometimes made a small and

reasonable profit ont of. such thingsâ given to me very often as gifts o f
gratitude by the distinguished persons who have come to meâ yet in this
case I felt somehow or other that it would not do. I would hunt out the
Citizen Duplessis somehow or other. Such things are always possible to a
man of determination. And so I trudired alone; to the Rue dv Theatre
Francais, and called first at poor Camiilt's own house. I found a poor old
servant in tears, and the house empty and in confusion. Lucile had gone
that day, and the child had beon removed by Citizen Duplessis himself.
The old man was very talkative, and though it somewhat bored me to talk
to people of that class after the company to which I iiad been accustomed
I could not help s aying and trying to assuace his grief. He took me all
through tbe house and showed me the disordered rooms, the furniture
thrown over, and wearing apparel scattered about carelessly and indiffer
ently. I was so full of compassion for the poor old man that I nearly got
myself into trouble by what I was led to say.
"WelJ, well," I said, after another outburst of his grief. "Well, well,
he died very bravely." There was probably a slicht professional ring in
nay utterance, as of a critic in sucn matters.
"He died bravely?" said the old man. "Tnen did you see him die?"
"Yes, yes," I said, somewhat taken aback, for it always takes me a
Blight effort of imagination to remember the view which prejudiced per
sons take of my profession. "Yes, I happened to see him die," I said
with an air of insouciance.
The old man immediately overwhelmed me with questions.
"Did he bear himself? Did he bre:ik down? Did he look very pale?
Did he say anything to the people? Was he executed first, second, third?"
ano so on. "How long did it take? How did he look in the cart?'
It was with the greatest trouble that I escaped from his endless chat
ter, satisfying him as well as I could on all the points, while carefuilv con
cealing the particular part 1 had played in the event. Fortunately for
" I TOOK ' THE LOCKET THAT HUNG ROUND HIS NECK."
Mb, he was so absorbed in sorrow for his m aster that my request for Citi
zen Duplessis' address aroused no suspicion. I suppose he thought that I
was a friend of the family, for he gave it to me almost automatically. Be
ing a man of business, I took down the address very carefully on a' piece
of paper, and, thrusting It into ray pocket, I took advantage of the diver
sion thus caused to take a hurried farewell and escape as quickly as 1
could from the old man's company. As I walked down the street I could
still see the old man standing at the door of the dismantled house, look
ing after me wistfully, with great tear-drops rolling down his old face.
You can imagine how painful that was for a man of feeling.'
The house of Citizen Duplessis turned out to be in the Rue dcs Arcs
and I Walked quickly, as I wa3 longing to get back to my wife and family
and spend a pleasant evening. I am not unsusceptible to flattery, and I
will confess that I v always derived considerable pleasure during that
period from the polite salutations I received at the hands of those whom
I suppose I must call my employers. In the course of this s ort walk I
met a good many of themâ strong Jacobins, believers iv the Terror who
valned my service. But I suppose my nerves had been a little jarred,
for I seemed to notice more than usual their lack of breeding and fine
manners. Their loud voices and coarse laughter were never acreeable to
me, but that evening they were even less so than usual. Their great tri
color rosettes seemed ridiculous to me, and I almost laughed at the
cowardly prominence with which they wore their "cards of surety" stuck
in the ribbons of their hats or pinned on to their coats. They did not de
ceive me, these fellows. I knew that they were all frightened to death of
one anotner, and, what id more, I knew that they had reason. When one
presides over such an institution as mine one sees pretty deep into things
and /or my part I could never tell whether I should not meet one
of these coquines on a different footing within twenty-four hours. How
ever closely they mi-ht be shaved, there was no knowing whetner they
would not be shaved yet more closely on the morrow!
As I walked I had time to reflect on my position and the task I had m
hand, and I did not come to view it with more complacency. I was a
fairly famous man in those days, ana even Citizen Duplessis might know
me by sight. It is hard for a man to be checked in the exercise of his
benevolent feelings, and I could easily foresee that if Citizen Duplessis
recognized me, he might treat me in a manner highly painful to one of so
sensitive a disposition. This feeling so worked on me that when I arrived
at the house in the Rue dea Arcs I bad fully made up my mind that 1
would acquit mysslf of my errand as speedily as possible and get back to
my home. I would not even see the citizen; I wouid leave tne locket
with the servant and go my way. I rang the bell, and a young servant
appeared whose eyes were very red. I could not help suspecting that she
had been weeping. I have ever been susceptible to the charms of female
beauty, and I cou!d not suppress a pang of pity for the poor girl, who was
very comely. And so it to?, I suppose, that I couched my message in
toneB that were unfortunately sympathetic.
"Is this the houÂ«e," I began interrogatively, "of Citizen Duplessis, the
father-in-law of the unfortunate citizsn Camille Desmoulins?"
"Yes, citizen, it is," said the girl, with a sob in her throat, almost break
iDg into tears at the mention of Caniille's name.
"I feave a message to convey," I said.
"If it is on business," she said, "I could not tell him; the Door citizen
is overcome with grief for his son-in-law. 1 "
"But it is from his son-in-lawâ a dying message from the Citizen Ca
mille himself."
I had spoken imprudently, and the excitement of the poor girl was
such that it was with the greatest difficulty that I made her listen to my
message and gave the locket into her hands. She begged me to come in,
but I stoutly refused.
"I will not disturb the citizen in his griei," I said. "Give him the
locket, andiell him that it has been conveyed by an unknown friend." And
then, turning abruptly. I left tue girl sobbing and kissing the locket, and
made my way down the street.
But, ciel ! I never was a lucky man, and never was my ill fortune so
brought home as on this occasion. I suppose that the girl, in her con- '
fusion, gave my message baJly. or else was unable to answer the questions
of the old man. At any rate I Dad scarcely gone a hundred yards down
the street when I heard the footsteps of one running behind me and a
voice of one calling me. It was the girl.
"Citizen," she cried, "you must return; my master will see you. You
cannot refuse him this.
. I was in a hurry and put her off somewhat brusquely.
"I am in a hurry," I said, "my good girl. Tell Citizen Duplessis that
I will return another day."
My position was already somewhat embarrassing. It was a narrow,
crowded streetâ one of those streets that were so numerous in old Paris,
but which have been mostly swept away with the new order of things'
The girl seized me by the arm and tried to detain me and passers-by began
to stop and laugh. What a position for a respectable citizen of middle age.
â¢ But lam a man of strong will, and it is possible that I might have
put the girl off. I bad scarcely, however, shaken myself free when I saw
an aged man, with no hat on his head and his white hair flying behin
him, with coat unbortoned and generally careless attire, running down
the street towarl us. It was Duplessis himself. He came up out of
breath and immediately saluted me with touching gratitude. He over
whelmed me with thanks, but piteously entreated me to return with him
to his house.
"You must have more to tell," he said. "You saw his last moments,
and it is impossible that you should have told us all. As you hope for
mercy, return," he cried, "for you little know how I loved him."
Mon Dieu ! It was one of the most awkward situations 1 had ever been
in. Here I was in a narrow street, one arm pulled by a young girl and
the other by an old man, both of them beside themselves and regardless
of appearances in their eagerness to hear my tale. Meanwhile a little
group had gathered round us, and at any moment one of these might
recognize my face, and in some rude jest or otherwis9 tell the old man
who I was. There was nothing for it but to give way. At any rate, I
reflected, the old man had not recognized me yet, and it is quite possible
for a man of the world like myself to get through an interview without
revealing my identity. So at last I agreed, and gently motioned to him
to lead me back to his house.
"It is impossible," I safd, "to resist such pressing invitations. My
business must wait, and I will return with you."
The old man was so overcome with gratitude toward me that he tried
to take my arm as we walked down the narrow street. But there was
something in me which made this intolerable, and with the best courtesy
I could assume I refused him, and as we could not^asily walk abreast in
that narrow street I dropped behind him and followed him silently to. his
house. We passed up a sufficiently ample staircase to the second floor.
He opened his door and I found myself k: a large, handsomely furnished
room, bespeaking a sufficiency of means in the occupant It was not
until afterward that I heard that he had been, before the Revolution a
wealthy roan; and though like most men in those days brought to pov
erty by these events, he yet retained an adequate income for his needs.
.He motioned me to a chair, and he himself, as if in a reaction from
his exciiement, tottered to an armchair in front of a tabie laden with
paper?â l doubt not that they were Camille's lettersâ collapsed rather
than sat down, and hid his face in his hands.
A long siJence tollowed, during which I watched him, respecting the
old man's grief, and full of pity for him, but at the same time revolving
in my own mind the neat replies I should give and the strategies that
might be necessary to conceal from him ray real vocation.
But he seemed to have forgotten me, and we sat thus for some time,
until I must frankly admit that I began to become embarrassed and to
wish that I was at home with my Charlotte. Just as I was reflecting in
this manner, and thinking even of rising and gently stealing from the
room, I heard a child's cry, and looking around with surprise I saw in one
corner of the room a cradle with drawn curtains.
At the cry the old man dropped his hands and looked up. And then,
as if moved by sudden passion, h s rose to his feet and tottered across the
room toward the cradle. He drew aside the curtains with a hasty move
ment and lifted from the craule a younc child of some two or three years.
The poor infant seemed to be very ill and was moaning piteously.* The
old man tottered across ihe room with, the child in his arms and almost
thrust him in my face, saying fiercely: ''This is their son !" As he took it
away he fixed on me eyes red as irons on an anvil, but quite dry they
seemed to have wept themselves out. But there were tears in his voice
it was husky with anger and grÂ»ei.
"This is their son!" he repeated, and embracing the child with a sort
of fury he carried him back to his bed and replaced him there. Then,
drawing the curtains, he sighed aeepiy, and once more relapsing from
anger to melancholy he tottered back to h'S chair and hid his face in his
hand.
Another silence supervened, and I was again thinking of retreating
from the room when suddenly he dropped his hands, and pulling himseit
together he fixed his eyes once more on me.
"You were there," he said laconically. "You saw him!"
I could not speak, and all my carefully rounded sentences fled from
me. The sight of such grief makes one dumb. All I did was to nod my
head.
Then he gave a sort of gulp and spoke again. "Lika a man of
feeling?" he said. "Like a republican?" He meant, or course, to ask
whether he had died in that way, but avoided the word deuth In a
manner that I have frequently noticed with people suffering under sucu
affliction.
"His last words," I said simply, once more finding myself bereft of ail
my pretty speeches, "his last words were for those he loved."
Again we relapsed into silence, and once more the old man hid his
face in his hands. But now I did not think I was mistaken in imagining
that I perceived drops of moisture trickling down between the interstices
of his fingers. There was something in what I had said which released
the fount of tears, and lie wept.
But suddenly something seemed to give a new turn to hia thoughts,
for he dropped his hands and leaned back in his chair with a deadly
pallor on his face. "Ana she," he cried out, and it was line the cry of
some wounded animal, "and she, my daughter, my poor Lucile, they
have taken her too! Will they be as merciless to her as they have been
to him? Two to mournâ is it iiot too much for miserable old people like
ourselves?"
He broke off, and his eye fell on me once more with the peculiar stare
of great grief. A horrible fear came over me, for 1 mistook it lor the look
of recognition, and I imacined he perceived who I was. Such is the
stupidity of se'.f-consciousness. For I suppose that he was really struct
with the thought that his grief seemed excessive to me. He must have
interpreted my embarrassed calm as a marls of disapproval. At any rate
he changed bis manner and suddenly began to argue with me with a sort
of mild, weak pathos that was very pitiful to hear.
"Ah, sir," he said, "you think that I am weak â that my grief is
against reason. I can see, sir, that you are yourself a philosopher, and
you think that in such a case you would be calm and fortified by your
philosophy. But believe me, sir," and he spoKe with a sort of passion,
"you are wrong. We believo ourselves philosophers, sir; we think we
are fortified by reason against the idea of destruction; but, piff!" he
blew a breath against his open palm â "it goes like that when death
comes. Where is our reason when it is our own child who is menaced?
Where is our philosophy when we find ourselves powerless to defend her
when we have to see her die, and mourn instead of fighting for her or
shedding our blood for her?" In his excitement the old man rose from
his chair and began to walk restlessly to and f*e. "On, my God!" he
cried, "to think that we shall not be permitted to receive her last sigh,
that she will be in agony for two hours and we shall be here in safety in
this house in which she was born; amid those things which she has
played with: before that hearth at which she has sat!"
You may imagine my embarrassment while the old man went on in
this pitiful manner. All my inmost feelings were touched. Tears were
starting to my eyes. I could not, indeed, help feeling some slight gratifi
cation at the thought that I should be capable of so much pity. But from
this complaisant reflection I was destined to be rudely aroused. The old
man seemed to notice the pitiful look on my face, and it brought him
back to a sense of my presence, which he had almost forgotten. For some
little time he had been walking up and down fingering the furniture
with his eyes fixed upon the things that Lucile had loved, lost in dreams
of the past. Then his eye suddenly fell on me, and he turned in a gracious
manner to me.
"Ah, Citizen," he said, "you must think me inconsiderate indeed to
speak thus before you, who have done so much to assuage my grief by
telling me of Camille's last hour." He spoke thus, though >ieaven knows
that I had had little opportunity of telling him anything. "But wiiat
tears my heart is to think that Lucile will not be so fortunate as Camille.
She may have no kind friend like you to bring word of her end. Ah, me!"
he said with a sudden outbreak of passion, "she may have no other mes
senger to bring us her last farewell than the hired ruffian who deals herâ"
He stopped short, surprised, I suppose, at the spasm which must have
passed over my face when he uttered these words, which struck me like a
physical blow. He looked at me for one moment with a slight wonder
and then his thoughts wandered off again, and he returned to his halfl
frenzied state of self-absorption.
As for me, I was in a turmoil, which struck me dumb. His phrase
acted like a sudden electric shock to my whole frame. It was useie-s to
reneat to myself that he knew nothing; that this was a mere chance
phrase. It seemed to be put into his mouth by something outÃide him.
And, though I am not generally regarded as a superstitious man, I seemed
to feel working in him a sort of outer consciousness, not himself,reproach
ing me for what I had done -as if it were Camille himself speaking through
him, and not to be deceived. I will confess that I felt a shudder creep
over my body and through my hair. I turned quite cold. It was quite
unnecessary, for he bad gone back into himself and once more lost all
sense of my presence. He was walking to and fro. wildly shaking his
white hair, his hands twitching, 1 his eve haggard, his whole aspect wild
On the mantelpiece there was one of those elegant busts of Liberty which
all we patriots used to purchase in those days. Terrible abominations I
have been told by artistic friends, but very sale for a prudent man to have
in his room ! As the old man passed this bust he stopped for one moment,
and it seemed to catch his eye.
Then, as if seized with a sudden outburst of fury, he took hold of the
bust, threw it on the hearthstone and crushed the broken pieces with his
foot. His rage was so great that I was reduced to utter silence Mv own
position was so terrible that I could not find it in my heart to play a part
The whole scene was too horribly real. I could find no consolation to ad
dress to himâ not a word of hope to say. From such hypocrisy I shrank
At this moment a fresh diversion occurred, which, while adding to
my despair for the minute, gave me ultimately a chance of escape. 1
bell rang, and a moment after a citizeness of middle ageâ l should say in
her fiftieth yearâ still handsome, but with a countenance haggard with
grief and despair, rushed into the room and threw herself into the arms
of the Citizen Duplessis. It was hiB wife, and she had just heard the news
that Lucile was to be tried.
"Lost!" she cried in ti terrible voice. "She is lost! She is to appear
before the Tribunal in three days!" \
A new horror came over me. Duplessia had not recognized me, but
then he was an old man and absent-minded with grief. My face was
known to most Parisians, and this woman, evidently in the prime of l;fe,
and probably full of Parisian gossip and knowledge, might at any moment

How Mind Worry Affects the Body.
One of the new discoveries of hygiene is the fact that in tne emotions
we have within ourselves an effective means of suicide, says the Washing
ton Star. If the emotions are not properly restrained and regulated the
body may be slowly but surely worn out, even without the sufferer him
self suspecting what the secret canker is. Dr. M. L. Holbrook shows the
importance of keeping our bodily expenses at or near our physiological
resources. There are times when the bodily resources must be freely
spent for others, as in emergencies, sickness, etc., but after the strain is
over the powers may be recruited by rest, sleep, recreatiou and food, and
no special harm ensues.
If this is not done there may be danger of a permanent breakdown.
The nervous forces are spent most rapidly through the emotional nature.
The pleasurable emotions are love, hoye, joy and peace. These are
health-giving, and, ii not in excess, nos exhausting. The painful emo
tions are fear, bate, anger and jealousy. These exhaust the vital forces
in two ways. They diminish the generation of energy in the body by in
terfering with digestion and assimilation ot food, and they also consun'o
rapidly and to little purpose what energy is produced. There is much ill
health which cannot be traced to its true cause unless attention ia turn^
to these painful emotions. It has of late been found that fatigue caused a
temporary change in the blood, and b healthy person who is inoculated
with the fatigue poison speedily exhibits all the symptoms of extreme
relaxation and exhaustion.
in the same way the evil emotions, and especially anger, produce sub
stances which are very poisonous, and if generated in quantities large
enough they might dehtroy life.Your Life May Be Indefinitely Prolonged by Scientific Means.
Three score years and ten has been for
the majority of mankind the accepted
term 01 human life. Not that all men live
seventy years; far from it Occasionally
'an individual is remarked whose span of
earthly existence reaches much beyond
that length of years; but the greater num
ber of human beines succumb long before
the centennial year is reached. The gen
eral sense of the phrase "three score years
and ten" is that a man ought to live that
length of time provided he obeyed the
laws of health. As a matter of fact, the
man who lives according to the laws of
na;ure will be in his prime, and a long
ways from dissolution on the attainment
of his seventieth birthday. The familiar
phrase originated in the early ages of the
present civilization, when sanitation was
an unknown quantity, and the present
knowledge of the conservation of energy
undreamed of. It can only apply to the
present by the permissible neglect of those
who do not care for anything better.
Death comes to the human individual
(accidental deaths, and these include such
as result from inherited taints of vital
disease, are not considered in the present
mention) as the result of a failure of the
power of assimilation.
Our physical bodies are changing every
moment of our lives. It used to be said
that the human body was changed every
seven years. It is constantly changing.
We exist partly by the food we eat and
â¢partly by the appropriation of the invisi
ble molecules surrounding us. Deprived
of air we should" die, although surrounded
by the most bounteous provision of tempt
ing viands. Insensibly our bodies are feed
ing through a million mouths, and through
a million pores of exit are passing off the
waste products. An atom of carbon, an
atom of iron and an atom of this and that
is taken possession of by our bodies and
used by the operation of what is known as
the process of assimilation. Provided this
] rocess goes on with undiminished vigor
there can be no death. It is only when
' for so:ne reason, generally a lack of vital
energy, this process becomes feeble, that
senile decay is apparent.

Van Dyck Brown 's Story of William Morris, the Beloved Poet of Merton Abbey
In the death of William Morris â poet,
artist, manufacturer and philanthropist â
England has lost one of the most interest-
ing personalities of the last half century.
. If his wonderful versatility almost pre
. eluded absolute supremacy in any one
â¢ direction.it gave infinite opportunity for
a broader development, a wider influence
for good, a humane and never-failing in
terpst in every subject that could affect
the artisan, the artist or the man of ele-
pant leisure.
He belonged to that remarkable circle !
called at first in scorn the pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhoodâ Ford Madox Brown, John I
Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and later i
B'mie-Jones. His personal appearance
â¢was striking and among facetious Oxford
men he was called "The Lion," not only
. for the leonine character of his head, but
for his habit of roaring, when annoyed, in
stentorian tones.
He had a massive forehead with a great
â  thatch of unruly, shaggy hair; a big
beard hid his rather grim mouth and j
chin. His manners were abrupt, at times
A Genuine Old-Fashioned Country Road Within the Limits of the City of San Francisco,
What other city in the world the size of
San Francisco can boatt of a country road
within its limits, only a short distance
.away from the busy marts of trade?
By this is not meant a street with a rural
appearance, but a real road, without side
walks or lamp-posts, that winds among
tree-covered hills, past ranches and gar
dens and pretty homes, with vines and
. flowers in the yard?, at the same time be
ing shut out from all sight and sound of
the busy metropolis. It is very likely that
the city by the Golden Gate stands alone
in this respect, as she does in many others.
It is also likely that comparatively few of
the residents of this City know of such a
road's existence, although most of them
have undoubtedly been within a few hun
i dred feet of one end of it.
V Nevertheless the road exists and is not
at all hard to find. It is down on tbe map
of San Francisco as "the Alnuhouse
Road," and the end nearest town starts at

have been made in the field of material
physics which liave developed the fact
that the basis of all physical action is
vibration. It is now a conceded fact that
the process of assimilation is a vibratory
one. I do not mean that our foods and
our beverages are transformed into be
coming parts and portions of our living
organisms by a process of shaking recog
nizable by human vision, but that every
atom of matter, be it of whatever kind,
has a definite rate of vibration, and that
changing the rate of vibration of that
atom changes its form of manifestation.
So that an atom of iron entering into the
human frame is by the rate of vibration
of the assimilation process so acted upon
as to have its rate changed, making it a
component part of our system. This
means that there b work to be done.
Measured by our finite scales it would not
appear that a very great amount of dy
namic force was necessary to change the
rate of vibration of a single atom. Inves
tigation of the laws of molecular attrac
tion demonstrate that in a single drop of
blood there are no less than five hundred
thousand million million millions of
atoms, each separated from each other by
spaces larger than the atoms. The figures
are almost too great for our mental grasp,
and yet they are demonstrable. Thus,
while the operation of a single atom may
be but the expenditure of an infinitesimal
force, yet the operation of the aggregate
involves the exercise of enormous energy.
If these premises are correct, and they
are virtually established, then it follows
that if the vibratory force of assimilation
can by any means be maintained at its
normal rate without slackening, the pro
cess of appropriation, use and ejection of
atoms by the human system will go on ad
infinitum, and there will be no decay and
consequently no death.
We require to know the rate of vibration
of assimilation.
The foremost scientists of the age have
enunciated that there is but one form of
the primitive atom, and that all other
atoms, of whatever name, are but the dif
ference in the grouping and motions of the
primitives.

Volsung." His artistic work was in many
directions. It was the result of many ar
guments that had originally turned him
from architecture to poetry, but in his
la*er work there were always traces of that
precise early training. One of his earliest
friends, Faulkner, bursar of an Oxford
college, himself a strong-willed, argu
mentative man. was generally his host,
in the early sixties and an Oxford student
of that period, who was invu d to Faulk
ner's Sunday breakfasts, had an unusual
opportunity to listen to the "sound and
fury" of dialectical battles. In this case
they wrre productive of unusual results.
A hobbyhorse Morris could always ride

turned out year after year abomina

lishing poems making the desire for
beauty almost a moral law. And from
theje Sunday breakfasts, where the very
crockery was iin periled by the force of
the arguments, the schema, so visionary
at first, was practically evolved to found a
business â a firm of decorators and up
holsterers who were to revolutionize Eng
land. The curious and unusual part of it
is that for once the dreamers succeeded â
not after straggle and labor, but immedi
ately. Not a university don in Oxford but
owned an esthetic coal Bcuttle; not one
of the tutors' wives but pointed proudly
to a wall covered with a Morrisoniau
design of flowering pomegranates.
The firm was called Morris, Marshall,
Faulkner & Co., and their first house was
in Red Lion square. Later they opened
in Oxford street and finally moved to
Merton Abbey, where they still remain.
And the widespread influence of this firm
of decorators was and Is remarkable. He
may be said to have revolutionized Eng
lish taste in decorative art. His idea was
that designs should be at once graceful and
natural, reproduced !rom natural outdoor
objects; that fabrics should be of substan
tial worth, whether they be the simplest
cotton stuffs or the most exquisite silks or
satins or brocades ; that colors should be
used that would stay fast through shade
and sun.
At present his work has met the inev
itable fate ' of any success; it has been
imitated and distorted .by the manufac
turers in England and America, less
scrupulous as to the quality and design;
it has been cneapened and made common
place, until it has been made to encourape
the very taste "for useless ornaments,
sham art and stupid bric-a-brac" ho was
most anxious to destroy. His name be
came falsely associated with that modern
fashion he^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^l
silly trifles that, to use his own worus,
"make our stuffy, art-stifling houses more
truly savage than a Zulu's kraal or an East
Greenlander's snow hut." He loved "frank
color?," pure and solid, and yet, as he
himself said with whimsical despair, "he
is supposed to have brought into vogue a
dingy, bilious-looking yellow-green â a
color of which he had a special and per
sonal hatred." His theories were simple
in the extreme. "Nothing can be a work
of art which is not useful, that is to say
which does not minister to the body when
well under command of the mind, or
which does not amuse, soothe or elevate
the mind in a healthy state. What tons
upon tons of unutterable rubbish, pretend
ing to be art in some degree, would this
maxim clear out of our houses if it were
understood and acted upon. If you can
not learn to iove real art at least learn to
hate sham art and reject it. Learn to do
withoutâ there is virtue in these wordsâ
and then from simplicity of life would
rise up the longing for beauty; and we
know that nothing can satisfy that de
mand but intelligent work, rising grad-
ually into irnacinative work, which will
turn all operators into workmen, into art
ists, into men."

Although the road really goes up hill it
does so so gradually as to be impercepti

farther into the depths of nature, and the
canyon becomes almost wild for a short
distance. There are bis jagged rocks
overtianeing the way and seeming ready
to fall at any moment. At this point the
hills on both sides are so high the sea

erament to blind himself with his own
ide*ls, and the terrible problems of the
day occupied him too much â made him
sacrifice his poetry to the needs of his fel
low-men. He became a socialist, not only
in the best sense of the term, but actively,
carrying his principles of equality into his
rela ions with his workmen. The actual
condition of the poor was to him a subject
of the keenest misery to the very end of
his life, and unconsciously he, pernaps,
did more harm than good by his passion
ate pamphlets, his lectures and addresses
to the various clubs of workmen of which
he was a member.
"Dreamer of dreams, born out of my
due time, why should I strive to set the
crooked straight?" he wrote in a moment
of weariness aud despair. But he did
strive, and the striving brought that
shadow of doubt and melancholy into his
poetic work so distinguished for its calm
ness and serenity, the freshness and
sparkle of a gayety almost Chaucerian.
Tbe sympathy with socialism is not
very great in America, perhaps because
the intense depth of such poverty as
meets the eye in England is not evident
and is not even existent. Here we read
every day of men of rank and power
throwing themselves and their wealth in
to the balance against the desperate flood
of abject misery and pauperism. There is
no touch of personal interest, of desire
for applause, of political or other advan
tage in their endeavors to stop the tide,
and however vain, however wild and
visionary the attempt, we have only re
spect and admiration for the effort. Un
fortunately the very arguments that are
most convincing to the intelligent and
prosperous men, the ringing eloqupnc* of
sympathy for the wrongs of the weak Â£r.d
downtrodden, become firebrands in the
mouths of the Ignorant, the half-starved,
the idle, fanatical socialist workman. To
him socialism and anarchism are synony
mous terms.
In Merton Abbey, in the oeautiful
county of Surrey, where every village sta
tion is overgrown with roses and flowering
vines, it is a very sunny kind of socialism
that William Morris was responsible for,
Here in thÂ« old Norman monastery the

and powerlul figure in a blue blouse, with
a great, nearty voice, and that strange
mixture of hostile reserve and fine cor
diality that made his manner so unusual.
He was always on the alert for a cynical
or a contemptuous attitude in others, but
once convinced of the contrary, and the
florid color would rise to his face, his eyes
would grow luminous and an indescriba

emanate from his whole personality.

just in their prime and make a most re
freshing shade, that is pleasant to look at
in cool weather and cooling when the sun

and in some places tbe branches of the
trees meet overhead, forming a natural
archway, the equal of any in the State.

called, molecular attraction; the universal
energy.
Within the past few years some astound
ing discoveries have been made of the
phenomena of vibration. Chiefly these
discoveries have occurred in the field of
electricity. We speak of the character of
an electric current by saying it iÂ« of a cer
tain voltage and amperage. The term
"voltage" represents its intensity, just as
we would say a stream of water is flowing
swiftly or slowly. The term "amperage"
represents quantity, corresponding to the
volume of the stream. A current of qlec
ti icily consists of a series of undulations,
and the rapidity with which these undu
lations follow one another determines the
voltage of the current. Therefore, the
higher the voltage the more rapid the vi
brations. We take hold of the handles of
a Faradic battery coil, and with a current
of a few volts we experience a sensation of
muscular contraction that becomes intol
erable if the voltage be increased to say
fifty. The trolly wire of the street rail
way carries a current of a thousand volts
coupled with large amperage. The unfor
tunate being whose physical system forms
aconnectin link between the live trolley
wire and the earth suffers a degree of
muscular contraction which renders him
helpless, and frequently death results
from a lesion due to the intense strain put
upon the muscular system by the current,
or from the enormous heating effect of the
great amperage. Yet, Tesla and, since his
experiment, numerous other experiment
ers, have passed through their bodies an
electric current of a million volts and en
joyed it. In these cases the current was
of small amperage.
If we sound at the same time a number
of musical notes, all of exactly the same
pitch, the result is a harmonious sound

walking among them are gardeners sing

The fact that the human body is able to
entertain an electric current of a million
volts, with impunity, whereas it suc
cumbs to disruption under the pressure of
a thousaml-volt current, bas set some
scientific minds to thinking.
Electrcal energy is the closest approach
to the universal force, i. c., molecular
force, that our present atate of scientific
attainment permits.
In the exhibition of the million-volt
current we were producing a sound closer
in approach to the human. When we
yhall know the exact rate (the voltage) of
an individual human, we shall then be
able to employ upon him a current of cor
responding voltage rate, and then supply
to his system a force of vibration that will
maintain bis assimilative process.
To this end a number of careful experi
ments are now being made to determine
the precise means whereby the voltage, or
rate of vibration, of the individual may be
accurately ascertained. Undoubtedly dif
ferent individuals have different rates.
Already it is ascertained that this rate, or
voltage, le somewhere between one and
three millions.
There is every reason to hope that the
opening of the twentieth century will
witness the accomplishment of the prob
lem. Once the particular voltage of the
individual is known, the proper applica
tion of a current of electric energy of a
corresponding voltage may be applied,
and the vibratory rate of the process of
assimilation maintained with as much
regularity as is now the steam in the
boiler of an ocean liner by the well-timed
feeding of the furnaces with coal.

Hot Water for Cough.
A sudden and wearing attack of couah

pecially in consumptives and those chron
ically ill. In an emergency, that ever
useful remedy, not water, will often prove
very effective. It is much better than the
ordinary cough mixtures, which disorder
the digestion and spoil the appetite.
Water almost boiling should be sipped
when the paroxysms come on. A cough
resulting from irritation is relieved by hot
water through the promotion of secretion,
which moistens the irritated surfaces.
Hot water also promotes expectoration,
and so relieves the dry cough.

Ghar\gir\g Suits Is Jnck-Losirvg.
Twice in the last six months we have bad
something to say on this subjectâ March 29
and May 10. Both of these articles should be
carefully reread by whist students. The views
tkfc-e expressed by us were heartily indorsed
by John H. Briggs, the whist king, of Minne
apolis, and others. From the pen of Milton C.
Work, author of "Whist of To-day," and one of
the foremost whist-players of America, is an
aiticlein the Evening Telegraph of October
23. He says:
"We cannot refrain, in view of some recent
occurrences, from repeating certain advice we
have often given in the past, and we cannot
express our views on the subject too strongly,
as we firmly believe the greateM failing of
the average whister is a wonderful desire to
change the suit.
"Our advice is, when you have the lead,
having won a trick third in Hand, be abso
lutely sure it is tne wisest play to shift the suit
before you decide to do so, and if thero is any
doubt in your mind on the subject give the
benefit of that doubt to the suit that lies just
been led.
"Remember every time you open a new suit
you place yourself at a disadvantage, unless it
is headed by a three-card sequence of which
the queen is a component part.
"Remember that to attempt to establish two
suits is the height of folly and thatas your
partner has already started to establish hi<
you will, as a rule, do better to aid him in that
effort rather than start off on a new tack with
your own suit, which is one trick farther from
establishment than your partner's. If you do
not return your partner's suit you virtually
say to him, 'Partner, in Â»pite of the disadvan
tage of opening up a new suit and, in spite of
the fact that yours has already once been led,
mine can be more easily established than
yours aud, therefore, I assume the responsi
bility of shifting.'
"The old doctrine oi showing your partner
your suit before returning his is one of the
absurdities of the past that is dead. That the
same authors should tell us to play two hands
as one aud yet play them in this way at cross
purposes seems, indeed, strange in the light
of modern experiences.
"Of course this advice only applies to a
fourth-best lead showing strength, but under
those circumstances it is worthy of considera
tion. We venture to say that twenty tricks are
lost by opening a new suit where one is
dropped by continuing that of the partner."
Whist â October-Jtatfember.
Whist na* heretofore been a month behind
time, but it has now caught up with the pro
cession, by issuing its October and November
numbers under one cover, and will hereafter
greet its readers on the first, rather than on
the last of each month. The current number
is particularly interesting. On the first page
appears a portrait of ex-President Schwarz,
Corresponding Secretary Weeing and the mas
ter, "Cavendish." It contains an article on
unblocking by "Cavendish"; the sbort-suit
game, by Fisher Ames; a valuable article on
the standard game, by John H. Briggs; aa In

JUVENILE GATHERINGS.
Receptions in Honor of Birthday
Anniversaries.
ZENA WILTON and (ieorgietta Ashley cele
brated their thirteenth and twelfth
birthdays respectively Halloween at the
home of Mrs. Wilton, 1011 Hayes street
Old and young participated in (fame!!, recita
tions, singing and dancing. Refreshments
were served. daring the afternoon and even
jnc. The little girls received many useful and
ornamental presents. Among tiiose present
gested changes Jn the laws, and an account of
the RideoKt trophy match between the Vallejc
and Oakland clubs.
jKe fortlar\d Whist Club
Opens its new year with a prosperous out
look. It has many enthusiastic players, and
plans are being arranged for a system of work
for the winter, including the regular tourna
ment and sorno new features. We ore sur
prised to find that ladles are excluded from
tne membership ol this club. We feel con
fident that wiih the best interests of the game
at heart, they would admit the ladies to mem
bership, and fina tne club growing more
prosperous, as has been the experience of
many of the hitherto most conservative clubs
in that particular. Eastern clubs are fast fol
lowing in the line of opening their doors to
the ladles, and we do not know of any strictly
whist club in California from which they are
debarred. We believe the ladies are not the
only losers in the present arrangement.
JKe Kate WKeelocU Glub.
We were again entertained by the Kate
Wheelock Club and listened to the third valu
able paper by Miss Shelby. Tho ladies are to
be congratulated upon having in their midst
so competent a teacher and they can but pro
gress rapidly in the game it they will mail
themselves of the opportunity for study which
few clubs have. The sciies of papers being
read by Miss Shelby would bear the severest
criticism of our ablest writers, and we have no
hesitancy in saying that the ladies oi Portland
hove a rare opportunity for instruction. The
old and trite saying that "A prophet is not
without honor save in his own country" is not
applicable in this case. We give below a deal
that was played in this club at its last meeting
and which shows excellent whist perception
and judgment on the part of one of its mem
burs. The position of ttie players was as fol
lows: Mrs. Stearin east, Miss Ingalls west,
Mrs. Carroll Hughe* south and our whist edi
tor north. The pretty play was iv Mrs. Hughes'
hand, south.
The deal was as follows:
were: Douglass Wilton, George Wilton, Zenie
Wjlton, Georgietta Ashley, Hazel Murphy,
Pansy Pearlman, Amy Fuller, Mary Jeffrey,
Reoa Henderson and Laily Niggle, Mrs. Wil
ton, Mr. ana Mrs. Henderson, Mr. and Mrs.
Dowdell, Mrs. Murphy, Mr. and Mrs. L.E. Ash
ley. MrÂ«. Nisrgle and Mr. Yocuni.
Miss Antoinette Miller celebrated her sixth

was served. Mrs. H. Miller was assisted in en
tertaining the littie ones by Mrs. J. D. Cal
iaiian.
FAREWELL PARTY.
Halloween Party at the California
Woman's Hospital*
On Saturday evening last a Halloween and
farewell party combined was given to the
nurses of the California Woman's Hospital, ou
Sacramonto street, by Dr. L. F. Garriguts, Miss
Alice A. Hall, and the matron, Miss C. P. Wii
son.
For the last three years Dr. Garrigues has
boon house surgeon at the hospital and Miss
Hall has been superintendent of nurses. On
account ol ill-health they have both recently
resigned their positions there.
In losing Dr. Garrigues the institution is
losing an excellent surgeon ana valuable
assistant, and one whose place it will be very
hard to till.
It is the same with Miss Hall, and her de
parture causes the nurses not only to lose a
thorough and conscientious teacher, but also
a true kind iriend. The hospital managers
have sent to Boston for a superintendent to
fill her place, and until she arrives one of the
very recent graduates will act as superintend
ent.
The order of the evening was Halloween
sanies of every description,- in which all
jollied most heartily. A sumptuous repast
was served in the nurses largo dining-room,
which was tastefully decorated with Chinese
lanterns and caudles.
During the feast Miss A. E. Ridley, acting as
speaker ol the evening, delivered a- beautiful
and touching farewell address to Dr. Garrieues
and Miss Hall. Those present were: Dr. L. F.
(iarrigues. Miss Alice Hall, Miss C. I. Wilson,
matron, and Miss Anna J. Hall.
Nursesâ Miss Grace While, Miss Susan B.
Hayes, Miss Louise Igo. Miss Laura Johnson,
Miss Nannie Williams, Miss Helen Anderson,
Miss Dora Danhauser, Miss Minnie t-chaw;
Miss Jessie McKenzie, Miss Nellie Griu-ell,

E. Sully, Miss Sophie Hebcisn, Miss Albertie
E. Ridley and Miss Caroline M. Pratt. '

Anna, who has been visiting her for the last
few months, will start for her home in Chicago
the early part of next week. ' Â» . :

Playing Whist for Stakes.
We are pleased to note that the editor of
Whist, in the dual October and November
number of that magazine, devotes much space
to the subject of playing lor stakes In clubs.
He makes a strong appeal to all clubs to plÂ«y
whist lor intellectual diversion rather than for
money gain, stating that when once the ne
farious practice obtains a foothold it soon
spreads and reaches proportions highly objec
tionable. To quote from the editorial: "it is
known that the passion lor gaming lies latent
in most men, and when once aroused it is
hard to eradicate. It has always been claimed
for whist |n this country that it does not en
gender this passion, aud this is true when
playing for stakes is not an adjunct cf the
game. But the minute 'playing for so much
a corner' begins that minute the game drops
from its proper dignity to the common level of
all other gambling games, and the clubhouse
in which the practice Is permitted ceases to be
the resort for that enjoyment of a highly in
tellectual pastime for which it was originally
designed. Ther# is no denying the fact that
the stake-players are not the better element in
the clubs where they have obtained a foot
ho'.d. They are generally infringing a rule
which they have agreed to be governed by."
At the last congress, by a unanimous vote, the
Commercial Travelers' Clud of Boston was ex
pelled for gambling, and without doubt the
league w!ll be called upon to effectually stamp
it out from ail league clubs.

"Mogul," in a letter of October 10, which
appears in the Public Ledger of Philadelphia
in, its issue of October 28, shows that he still
has a "(rood right," as the great John L. would
t>ay. This time he goes for "Signals at Whist"
in his usual sharp, breezy style, arousing the
ire of "Cavendish," who pithily replies in The
l-'luld of October 17, objecting to his use of the
word arbitrary in connection with a rule, or
(as â¢â¢Cavendish" puts it) a principle of the
game. These discussions exalte interest in
the game, and we hope they will be kept up.
Short-Suit Glubs and Short-Suiters.
It is getting to be quite "the thing" now for
whist players who have a very high opinion of
their own whist ability to switch to the short
suit and other fads which the whist wind
blows their way. Our limited experience
firmly convinces us that the leading advocates
of this short-suit piay have never made much
of a ripple in the waters of whist (they are
something like ourselves, they play better on
paper than at the whist table), and r.re com
pelled to take the other side or drop out.
Without doubt some good comes from agi
tating this system. It gives encouragement
to the class ot players who are always anxious
to "get In a little trump" by leading -'a sneak,"
etc., but they will never succeed in converting
a whist student to their theory. It is a ques
tion in our mind if they have any theory. We
never could understand how players of this
school hope to make many tricks in s,ui s con
taining one or two cards only, unless they ex
pect to be always favored with more than
their share of trumps.

Gossip About
Californians in
New York
I NEW YORK, N. If., Nov. I.â Last Sat
urday was the most memorable day of its
kind in the history of New York:.
i It was flag day and the G. O. P. had
wisely agreed that it would parade the
streets of New York on that day. It would
1 Â«be impossible in tuis limited space to be
gin to describe the most remarkable pa
rade in the history of this State. Over
125,000 men were in line, and more than
I 450,000 people stood for hours on the pave
ments and cheered and shouted until they
were fioarse. Tbe proudest man in New
York Saturday was General Horace Por
ter, grand marshal of the day. There
couldn't have been a better man appointed
for such an undertaking, for General Por
ter was on General Grant's staff during
the latter part of the war, and he haa had
vast experience in ordering and manipu
lating large bodies of men.
It was extraordinary to view thou
sands upon thousands of men swing
ing by in unbroken file. There wasn't
a hitch in 'the whole parade; just the
tramp, tramp, tramp of the 125,000 stanch
and true Republicans. From the Battery
to Forty-first street they game, shouting
and singing. Yellow chrysanthemums
were the favorite flowers of the day, and
every man, woman and child had one
stuck somewhere. Some were made of
paper, some of cloth, but the most
popular were the ragged "cold-slaw" ones
that had grown on real live plants.
Tbe Fourth of July has never been cele
brated with more enthusiasm and splen
dor than was Flag day last Saturday, the
day of the Republicans' magnificent de
monstration. New Yorkers will never for
get it.

New York housewives arc having their !
own troubles these days. The coy and !

Figures Show the Evolution ot
the Free Bath Into a
Pay Bath.
TRUST FUND WAS TOO SMALL
Year After Year the Running Ex
..'pens?s Have Far Exceeded the
Provided Income.
Step by step and year by year the "Lick
Free Baths," destined by their founder to
be untrarameled as the air and fried from
the restraints of tollcates, are becoming
"pay baths" in the strictest sense of the
word, and those who have not where to
lay their heads have not now where to
bathe their bodies, unless they possess 10
oe-nts.
So rapidly have the running expenses of
.the great baths eaten into the reserve
fund that the trustees were forced to find
ii new Source of income or close the doors
'â of what was the dead philanthropist's fond
dream for benefiting the great unwashed.
Th"c evolution of the free bath is an inter
esting study, and its latest phase is told in
the following card, issued a lew days ago:
NOTICE TO BATHERS.
At a meeting of the board of trustees of the /
James Lick Baths, held October 15, 1890, the )
following order was adopted, viz. :
' "Rvsolced, Tnat on and after November 1,
1896, 10 cents each will be charged for baths,
the usual supplies accompanying same,
namely, towels, soap, etc."
This en urge Is necessary to realize sufficient
revenue to pay taxes and expenses of main
taining the James Lick Baths.
By order of the bocrd of trusteesâ John O.
Earl, James K. Wilton, 11. Â£. Mathews, Jacob
Bjern, trustees.
It is the opinion of all who are familiar
with the Lick estate and the various
trusts that the old millionaire established
â¢that the baths have been the weak spot, j
the one great failure.
The following language created the bath
trust and sought to maintain the enter
prise freefor all time to come:
"And -in further trust, to expend the
Bum of one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars ($150,000) under the direction of
H. M. Newball, Ira P. Rankin. Dr. J. D.
B. Stillman and John 0. Earl and the sur
vivors of them, in the erection and main- j
taining jn the City of San Francisco free j
baths'; the site or sites therefor to be ac
quired and held by the persons last
named and the survivors of them in trust,
to forever maintain such baths lor the free
use'of the public under proper and reason-
regulations; said baths to be erected
as soon as practicable to raise the money
after the money has been provided to
erect said telescope."
Under the term "proper and reasonable
regulations" the trustees get their au
thority to charge for towels. They so con
structed the expression and the courts
have upheld them in their construction.
These baths were opened in November,
1890, and a charge of 5 cents was assessed
for towels. The fee resulted in an attack
on the management by many people. The
Federated Trades passed resolutions of
censure and others denounced the trus
tees.
A little mathematics, however, will
demonstrate plainly that there must be
an income aside irom the reserve fund or
the baths must be closed. The original
sum of $150,000 has about melted and
there is no longer an income of interest.
The real estate and improvements cost
$128,000 and the furniture $1000. Vacant
lands, worth about $78,000, remain intact
ana bring in a small rental.
The following figures tell the story of
the first five years' management of the
trust:
Taxes for five years $4,0-32 35, running
expenses $43,590, renovations and im
provements $3911 91. Against ibis ex
penditure there ha* been the following in
come: Rents Â§iS2O 50, interest $2471 75, in
come on towels $26,296. Excess of ex
penses $20,534 31.
The deficit has been made up hereto
fore from the surplus that has now melted,
hereby cutting off the income from in
terest. The expenses the past j'ear have
been: Taxes $1306 59. running expenses
$7Â§23 10, improvements $30. The income
has keen: Interest $S4 28, rents $2076 50,
from towels $5142 GO.
It will thus be seen that the excess of
â¢expenditures has been for the past year
$1856 81. J
The -trustees were confronted with the
alternative of increasing the income or
closing the baths. They spent too much
iiipneyiu builJij.g the baths to allow a
reserve fund that would forever maintain
' tnem from the interest. If the 10-cent fee
for toweis does not maintain the baths
now they will have to be closed or ihe fee
.will hava to be raised.

â¢ â¢â¢ men in a Vienna Museum.
. .The so-calied "sleeping fakirs," who
some months ago excited no little inter

correspondent of the London' Standard to
/. lave -been unmasked in Pesth. These
s;iku"S l>ac! of late been going through their
fortnight's sleep at the l'anopticon, in the
S Hungarian capital, a perlormance lor
which they were paid Â£4 a day. For some
time they had been under the suspicion of
. being impostorb. In order to put the mat
ter to the tOMt, the proprietorof the Panop
ticon, on Friday evening, concealed two
men amor.g +.lie wax figures to watch the
fnkirs when everybody elee Had left, and
the hall was closÂ»d for the uisbt.
Presently the fakir. Bend Send Pratapa,
rose in his glass opffin and took a bottle of
mUk and some provisions from under his
pillow and, alter eating and drinking,
lighted a cigarette. The two watchmen
rushed up to him and gave an alarm. The
fnkir tried to justify ninjself by saying
that he thought he had already completed
ills fortnight's sleep. The proprietor re
. quested ti:e police to arrest the two ialcirs,
by whom ho considers himself to huve
been cheated. The police have not yet
.acceded to his request, bin are havuitr the
performers watched. Some of the P.sth
i"" papers, however, thinK it is premature to
think of unmasking an impostor, because

GLAD PROSPERITY
SMILES ON ALL
President Becker of the
German Bank is
Happy.
Financial Conditions Have Im
proved Since McKinley's
Election
AND CONFIDENCE IS RESTORED
Times Were Hard B?cause It Was
Feared That Bryan Had a
Chance to Win.
San Francisco financial institutions
have feit the beneficial effects of the elec
tion of Major McKinley and none have
realized this favorable state of affairs so
much as the savings banks.
Ju?t before the election it was a com- '
mon thing to see rows cf men and women !
at the windows of the paying toilers of the
various savings banks waiting for a chance
to draw out their gold. Now the current)
has changed, and the receiving tellers
have all they can do to handle the beauti
ful yellow boys that are pouring in on j
them.
B. A. Becker, president of the German
Savings Bank, yesterday expressed the
feelings of the financiers of the City
touching the effect which the result of the
recent election had on the material inter
ests of the community.
"You see that all the officers o.' our bank
wear smiling faces," said Mr. Becker, and
the assemblage of gentlemen present at
the Saturday afternoon consultation by
their looks confirmed the president's re
marks. "We feel that the people of the
country have made a wise decision, and
the occurrences of the past few days have
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1896.
borne us out in this opinion. So long as
there was a chance for Mr. Bryan to win
people feared to invest their funds in any
kind of bu-iness. That was what made
limes hard.
"The election took place on the 3d, and
on the 4th the people manifested the im
provement in their feeiinp-s. In fact,
financial confidence returned simulta
neously with the. returns that indicated
the election of McKinley. As I said, on
the mornintr after election, the people
began to come in with their deposits, on
the sth it was better, on the Cth there whs
a still lurtuer improvement, and to-day,
the 7th, has been the best of all.
"We, who were on tho right side, and
all who thought as we do, expected an
improvement in the financial condition,
of course, or we would not have oxerted
ourselves as we did lor Mr. McKinley's
election, but we aid not look for so sudden
ana complete a revolution in business
affairs.
"The unsettled conditions that prevailed
befo r e the election, brought on by he
iear that Mr. 15ryan night possibly be
elected, will speedily give way to a better
feeling in all departments of financial
operations. This, of course, will make
the money market easier, and every branch
of business will feel the impetus of a full
supply of capital for carrying on legiti
mate commercial undertakings."
Other members of the bank's directorate
expressed similar opinions.
President E. J. Le Breton of the French
Savings Bank was in a happy mood. *'I
spent bix hard weeks working for McKin
ley and some of the municipal nominees,
whose ejection I considered of importance
to t lie community," said Mr. Le Breton.
"Well, we were successful and ought to be
satisfied. 1 for one am content with the
result.
'â¢The restoration of confidence was of
primal importance and McKinley's elec
tion brought this about in short order.
The improved conditions are felt in every
department of business, and of course the
savings banks are the first to notice this
change for the better. '
At the Hibernia Savings Banfc and the
other savings banks of the City where ob
servations were taken by reporters yester
day it was noted that the depositors were
numerous, while those who were seeking
to withdraw their funds were relatively
few.
Among the managers of the commercial
bank- a like gratification is expressed on
account or the result of the election and
the effect it has had on the business con
ditions of the community.
A gold coin passes from one to another
2.000,000,000 times before the stamp or im
pression upon it becomes obliterated by
friction, while Â» silver coin changes be
tween 3,250.000,000 times before it becomes
eutirelv defaced.

THREE MILLIONS

Ex- Minister Jones' Story

the East.
How Some Men Made $25,000
Out of a Lot of Large
Bugs.
ON THE EDGE OF A BOOM
The Hawaiian Bonds to Be Taken at
4. Per Cent and the Dibt
Refunded.
Hon. P. C. Jonea of Hawaii, who was ti
member of Quten Liliuokalani's last Cabi
net, afterward Minister of Finance under
the Dole Government, and now one of the
Council of State, is ai the Occidental.
Mr. Jones went East some months ago
with the view of placing $3,000,000 worth
of Government bonds at 4 per cent inter
est. The Government had been paying G
per cent, and it was proposed to refund the
debt, so that the new arrangement could
be made, as Eastern parties stood ready
to take the bonds.
When Mr. Jones arrived, however, he
found such excitement over the pending
election lhat nobody would invest in any
thing.
"1 found it impossible," said he, "to ac
complish anything whatever. It was use
less to try. and as a matter of fact I only
did try it with one man. Then I pave it
up. In New York, Boston and Philadel
phia not a capitalist would touch any
thiner. Massachusetts gold bonds had to
be placed in London.
"The people on the Atlantic seaboard
were hoarding gold. There was such a
stringency that no one would listen to
anything.
"But now that the National election is
over, it is a different thinjr, and I am
assured that the bonds will be taken soon. !
My own opinion is now that we are on
theedce of a great boom. Large orders !
were given to manufacturers conditional
on vhe election of Mr. Mcfvinley, and <
now that he is elected tlirse orders will
be iillea. I was in New York when tne
parade of 135,000 men occurred, in which
each man wore a gold bug bi* enough to I
be seen across the street. It was an im
posing scene.
"Speaking of the gold bugs reminds me
of when, some time before the election, a
manufacturer went to his men and told
them that if they could think of any way
the factory couid run they could go
ahead and make all they could out of it.
One of them thought of these gDld bugs
and tl>e men turned to and manufactured
them till they had made $25,000. It was a
very lucky thing for them.
"I aiwavs ielt that California would
vote right in this election. lam satisfied
now that times will not only sneedilv be
come prosperous, but that we shall have
such ji period of prosperity as perhaps we
have not Known in many years."
Mr. Jones will sail on Tuesday on the
steamer Australia for home.
Easteru Ignorance of the West.
It is unquestionably true that the aver-
age s:ay-at-home citizen of the East has
entirely failed to measure the muscle of
the Westâ or, better yet, the muscle of
the country. "We have all been recently
amused by Mr. Depew's "discovery" of
California. After a long life of activity,
with countless trips to Europe and else
where, it is only within the last three or
four years that he has penetrated farther
west than Chicago, and only this year
that he has ventured beyond Denver
which is itself but a trifle farther than
half-way across the continent. Mr. Depew
is an example of a large clasi.â The Forum.

1 HE. CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Take a rest to-day.
It has been a lively week.
Prosperity is near enough at hand to be
felt.
Last night we filled the heavens with
light.
The battle was hard and the triumph
glorious.
You can count on McKinley to open op
portunities for labor.
Recreate yourself to-day and then
square away for business.
Republicans have the victory, but every
body will share in the benefits.
It is ratner rough to have to wait four
months before we pet rid of Grover.
There are a few Democrats left to
inarch, but who is left to Jead them?
This is a good time to make up your
mind to patronize California industry.
A good cure for the blues in these days
is to study the trade reports and watch
industry revive.
Speaker Reed will have no difficulty in
counting a quorum in the next Congress
any more than in this one
Give California goods the benefit of the
trade revival and keep the money circu
lating among your neighbors so it may
come back to you.
With the celebration last night we close
the political rallies of the season, and now
let all hands tu/n to other things ana
enjoy the better times.
One thing you may be sure of. There
will bÂ« no mugwumps in the ilcKinley
cabinet. We are goiner to have a thor
oughly American administration.
California should take tbe lead in in
dustrial development under the JlcKinley
administration. She has the resources
and the capital and why not also the en
ergy and the enterprise?
The Parisians are calculating that Sarah
Bernhardt will be one of the dramatic at
tractions of their city during the exposi
tion of 1900, and after that of course we
may expect to tet her on a farewell tour.
It is not likely that European diplomats
believe in the Sultan's promise of reform,
but as they are not able to keep their own
promises they are willing to accept it on
the ground that they get as good as they
give.
The New Yorkers propose to celebrate
in January the centennial of the estab-
Ishment of their Stale capital at Albany,
but if they find anything in the record to
be proud of they will have to go a long
way back.
A story has been ttarted in Chicago* that
Depew looks like Gladstone, and of cours â 
New York will revise it so as to make it
read that Gladstone looks like Depew.
Chicago never does get her New York
facts exactly right.
A Vermont jury has just given a phy
sician $20,000 damages against a fellow
who alienated the affections of the phy
eician's wife, and now the question arises
what a California wife's affections would
be worth, estimated on the Vermont basis.
Things are getting very cool in the East.
For example the Philadelphia Record as
serts that if it had not been for the Palmer
Democrats the Republicans would never
have had the courage to support the cause
of sound money. How is that for frozen
ea.l?
It is reported that Postma3ter-G'neral
Wilson is to bo given the Chief Justice
ship of tbe Court of Claims, ana if the re
port is true the fiasco statesman of the
deficit tariff will pass out of our politics
forever and will soon cease to be a target
for swearing at.
Under Turkish law the only man who
can legally depose a Sultan is the Sheik
ul-Islam, the secular head of the Moham
medan hierarchy, and the present Sultan
has shown his staying powers by putting
the present Sheik in prison and threaten
ing him with death if he talks too much.
According to figures collated from an
advanced copy of the eighth annual report
of the Interstate Commerce Commission
the railway mileage of the country, which
increase! 4593 miles during the last year
of the McKinley tariff increased only 1949
miles in 1895. Ia it any wonder railway
workers voted for a return to McKinley
conditions?
The French Canadian invasion of New
"England once more attracts attention, as
it is said thai 55,000 of thpm have settled
in Maine alone. The immigration, how
ever, is not viewed with alarm, as experi
ence has proven the new coiners to be in
dustrious and thrifty immigrants witii a
ready adaptation to New England ways
and manners.
One of the craziest freaks of the period
is that which has prompted the Los Ange
les Times to exalt itself as the champion
that carr ed California for McKinley and
to denounce The Call for an alleged luke
warruness in the contest. As San Fran
cisco, wLiere The Call mainly circulates,
showed Republican gains, while in Los
Angeles there was a heavy falling from
the normal party strength, it is clear that
in rnaKin-' a boast of that kind the Times
10-t its wits as completely as it lost the
Be publican vote.
THE CELEBRATION.
The celebration last evening of jubilant
Republicans put the finishing touch upon
the political campaign. We have now
fought the battle, won the victory and ex
ulted in the triumph. That which re
mains to do is to rally the people to the
standard of industry, to go forward and
reap the benefits of a revived prosperity.
The tone of the speeches which gave ut
terance to the sentiments of the victors at
the polls was not that of mere partisan
triumph. It was more like the voice of a
general rejoicing over the end of a long
depression and the beginning of a new era
of prosperity than the exultation of one
party of citizens over another. It was
altogether fitting that this tone should
prevail, for no other would adequately
represent the feeling which prompted tbe
great rejoicing that was manifest in every
part and feature of the celebration.
During the hard times of the last three
years the people ot this country have
learned the value of business. They now
understand its relation to the happiness of
the individual and the welfare of the home
better than before. They also compre
hend its great importance to the Nation,
inasmuch as the absence of business
breeds discontent and gives a power to
agitators which threatens to be danger
ous.
In his speech at the Cooper Union, New
York, during the campaign, Colonel Rob
ert Ingersoll forcibly and beautifully ex
pressed the benefits conferred by business
in words which can be read with pleasure
this morning, for there is in them some
thing more than the argument which
passes with the occasion it was made for.
They express a truth with an eloquence
that will long be remembered.
"There is no charity like business," he
said. "Business gives work to labors
countless hands; business wipes the tears
from the eyes of widows and orphan*;
business dimples with joy the cheek oi
sorrow; business puts a roof above the
heads of the homeless ; business covers the
land with happy homes. We want busi
ness. Wind and wave are our servants;
let them work. Steam and electricity are
our slaves; let them toil. Let all the
wheels whirl; let ail the shuttles fly. Fill
the furnaces with flame; let them glow.
The smoke arising from the factories'
great plants forms the only cloud on
which has ever been seen the glittering bow
of American promise."
It was the realization of the truth of
these words that moved the gre:it majority
of the American people to vote for McKiu
ley and Hobart. It was the consciousness
that the Republican victory means a re
turn of business and all that it implies,
which in-pired the rejoicing bo abundantly
snown last evening. The people are now
certain the smoke of factories will arise
and that the great rainbow of American
promise will soon overarch the Republic
from ocean to ocean.
It was for that reason the ceiebration
was made in the character of a popular re
joicing. All Americans, no matte.- how
they voted, will share in the benefits to
come. Let us turn away from politics
and party strifes and go forward to other
things. Colifornia bore her part bravely
in tbe political contest and will now march
with the most progressive of her s:ster
States in the movement onward and up
ward to those hich levels of prosperity
which await tne American people.
THE FRUIT INDUSTRY.
The annual review and harvest edition
ol the California Fruit Grownr, which has
just been issued, affords considerable
cause for congratulation to tbe people of
the State. While the year under review
has not been altogether a prosperous one
for i.be producing classes, there is now an
advance in prices and the outlook is satis
factory. The edition deserves a careful
study. No other State in the Union could
make such a showing of rural industries,
and the crop reports, which are regarded
as not favorable here, would, in other sec
tions of the country, be cited as evidences
of prosperity.
Unfavorable weather conditions have
shut off the harvests for some of the pro
ducers, bat all things seem to be working
together to provide for the prosperity of
the future. A large crop and low prices
in 1895 served the good purpose of intro
ducing California products into new local
ities and got people into the habit of using
them. This haDit will be hard to break.
The luxuries of yesterday become the
necessities of to-morrow. The goods
which needed the temptation of easy get
ting to make them sought in the first in
stance will now be reached out for with
more ea.uer effort. So the shorter harvests
will find a mo.-c brisk demand and a higher
price.
Looking back for comparison over a
period of four or live years a steady and
most satisfying increase is noted. The
wine shipments have grown from about
9,500,000 gallons in 1890 to nearly 15,000,000
in the last year. Shipments of fre*h fruit
have improved in live years from 98. 080 000
pounds to 132,568,540; dried fruit from
65,000,000 to 122,654,300, which is nearly
double. Raisins have a little more than
doubled, being now 92,775,650 pounds.
Citrus fruits have increased from 93,950,
-700 pounds to 231,657,630. Shipments have
increased nearly threefold in nuts, they
being now 6,468,500 pounds. Canned
fruits were 49,580,750 in 1891, and the last
crop year showed 62,595.800 pounds. The
California dairy Industry produces more
than $14,000,000.
Tnese statistics are full of encourage
ment for our rural industries. The out
look, however, is even better t an tlie fig
ures show. Protective legislation will not
on!y make the home market safer for
California fruits, But will make it larger
and batter by promoting the industries of
the cities The future, therefore, is full
of promise, and to no part of tbe Union
more than to California.
EMERSON'S HUMOR.
Most readers of Emerson have probably
been struck with the surprising contradic
tions in his assertions. On one pa c will
be found what reads like a most profound
truth condensed into a mo:t quotable
phrase. One is forced to believe that thi*
is true, or at all events, a very profound
mind considered it true, and therefore the
statement is worthy of sti.dy and remem
brance. But the reader reaches a few
pages further nnd there finds the reverse
of this sentiment stated just as forcefully
as the first. No doubt they are both ex
pressions of honest convictions held at
the moment they were written, but it is
truth as seen through very varying mood?.
It may be an il ustration of the power of
a comprehensive mind to see on both sides
and in fact all round a question.
An illumination on the peculiarity of
his mind in this way ia shed by some
quotations from his works cited in an
article on "Emerson's Wit and Humor"
in the November number of the Forum.
He says: "I am always insincere as
always knowing that there are other
moods." "Consistency is the bucbear of
small minds." "The truest state of mind,
rested in, becomes false." These remarks
about himself prove that he was quite
aware of his contradictions, and that this
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1896.
seeming defect to some minds was, in bis
< wn estimation, strength.
One of tbe most remarkable cases of
apparently opposing views can be noticed
in his expressions about tne benefits or
evils of solnude and society. Either seems
greatly good or greatly injurious as shifts
the point of view. Another instance is in
the two ways in â¢which his wisdom looks
upon wealth and poverty.
A young man reading Emerson's essays
for enlightenment would fiisd it difficult to
decide which of the two was really the
best posses-ion for him. There is so much
to be said on both sides, and Emerson can
see them so clearly and state them so con
vincingly. Ii might be wise for the poor
youth to read what the philosopher has to
say of the advantages of poverty, and the
gilded youth his remarks about the desir
ability of possessing wealth. If young
men will insist upon reading both
ihe essays then neither rich nor poor
will be left with the contentment afforded
by the perusal of only one, and the
wealthy who desires to get all the good
there is to be had from earthly training
must decide to become poor, and the
penurious to strive for the power of self
improvement which riches can give.
One of the peculiarities of Emerson's
wit was that he believed "true wit never
made us laugh." He was careful to strike
out of his lectures all those passages which
he found produced laughter. One of the
samples given of his wit and wisdom is
that once, when deeply absorbed in con
versation on some problem of philosophy
with a friend in his garden, his wife called
to him to bring her some wood. He took
her the wood and then went bacK to his
friend, remark. n? with a smile, "We will
now return' to th 9 real things." As an
example of how he retained his humor,
even after being stricken with exasperat
ing misfortune, it is told that when he had
to a large extent lost bis memory he was
one day searching Jor his umbrella, and
could neither find the thing in his house
nor the name of it in his mind. He ex
plained by saying: "I can't call its name,
but I can tell its history. Strangers take
it away."
BRYAN'S LAST ADDRESS.
The address to tlie bimetallists with
which William J. .Bryan sums up the re
sults of the campaign will neither in
crease his reputation nor add anything to
the strength of his cause. At best it is but
a claim that the gold standard will prove
disastrous to the peopie under the Mc-
Kinley administration ; that the Republi
can pledge for international bimetallism
has been but a deception, und that four
years from now the cause of the silverites
will triumph.
In ibis much there is nothing unex
pected and while there is in it no orig
inality there is also nothing deserving of
condemnation. It is always permitted the
defeated to declare their willingness and
their eagerness to try the batiie again at
another time and under more favorable
conditions. The American people know
whatvaluo to put upon this form of bear
ing defeat, and had it Btood alone itwouM
cause nothing more than a smile of amuse
ment. Mr. Bryan, however, has had the
bad taste and, what is worse, the apparent
deliberate falseness to charge that his de
feat has been due to unfair means and to
give a new utterance to the foolish and
senseless cry of coercion.
He tells t c bimotaili3ts: "Trusts and
corporations have tried to excite the fear
of lawlessness while they have been defy
inc the law," and informs them that suc
cess will yet be attained "ia spite of
the efforts of the administration and
its supporters, in spite of tbe threats
of money-lenders at home and abroad, in
spite of coercion practiced by corporation
employers and in spite of the influenca of
a hostile daily press."
It seems hardly worth while to refute
these silly assertions at this late da}'. Mc-
Kir.iey has been elected not only by an
overwhelming vote of the electoral col
lege, but aUo by a popular majority of a
million. No such victory has ever before
been gained by a Presidential candidate.
Never before have the American people
been so unanimous on any issue since tbe
days of Jefferson. All sections of the
Union and all classes of the people, in
cluding conservative Democrats, have
united in winning this great victory for
sound money, protection and good gov
ernment. To raise the cry of coercion in
the face of such a majority as this regis
tered by secret ballot, .3 the very madness
of politics. It argues a mind incapable of
recognizing facts, as well as a rhetoric
reckless of truth.
This statement will probably be the
last of Wiiliam Jennings Bryan's as a
National figure in American politics. He
sprang up as suddenly as Jonah's gourd,
and was as suddenly withered. He leaves
behind him nothing the American peo
ple will ever care to recall. His oratory,
like his politics, was false and thin, and
neither has in it anytum,' that will last
longer than tha fading leaves that are
now being stripped from the trees by the
November wind.
PROSPERITY ASSURED.
Republican victory has been immediate
ly followed by prosperity. In place of the
panic which resulted fiom the election of
Cleveland we have the public confidence
revived by the election of MeKinley. The
news of the day abounds witu evidences
that the good times so long waited for
have arrived. Business has resumed and
in a few days the circulation 01 money in
all the channels of trade will afford oppor
tunities for work and wages to all who
need them.
In this City, in this State, and through
out the Republic, reports are coming of
renewed activity in industry and enter
prise. Every class of business has been
affected to a greater or less extent. Every
city in the Union reports the immediate
opening of mills which have long been
closed, and in pyery Siate there are an-
nouncements of a rise in the prices of the
products upon which the people live.
From Chicago comes the news that the
Illinois Steel Company has opened up
works employing 2800 men; the knitting
mills of Hagerstown, Fa., have started up
with a full force of hands; the carworks of
JoffersonÃville, Ind., have employed 2500
additional men. From Baltimore comes
the news that $16,000,000 is ready for in
vestment in Maryland enterprises, and so
all over the Eastern States il is felt that
with a return of confidence prosperity is
already here.
In ttiis State and City prospects are
equally good. As was reported in our
local columns on Friday the Valley road
directors are preparing oonds with a view
of constructing the road southward from
Fresno and in other direction?. Julian
Sonntag of the California Miners' Asso
ciation and president of the Manufact
urers' and Producers' Association pre
dicts improved activity and business at
once. M. F. Smith, the borax king, de
clares that he will put 200 men to work as
a result of the election of McKiuley, and
G. H. Umbsen speaks of a bicycle factory,
a cracker factory and a gun factory lor
which capital is forthcoming in this City.
It matters not, therefore, in what direc
tion we look we see not merely signs of
returning prosperity, but clear evidences
of a prosperity already begun. In the
employment of these additional men
every man who has long been out oi work
can see good omens of coming employ
ment for himaelf. This winter will not be
known as the winter of our discontent.
American workingmen have long hunted
ior jobs and now jods will be hunting for
them. The whirr of machinery and the
hum of industry mane the music of the
time and carry gladness to every heait
and a hope to every home.
Almost every day from this time on for
some months to rome will bring news oi
some new enterprise beetin, some former
industry expanded and some new oppor
tunity open for labor. In the conscious
ness that the election of McKinley means
protection to industry capital will come
forth from its hiding place and enterprise
will lose its timidity. There will be a for
ward movement all along the line. We
have done with df ticit tariffs, depressions
and disasters. We nave returned to the
normal conditions of American life and
opened the mills once more to the free
coinage of American labor.
SPECIAL ELECTION
It took the seven columns of the last
page of the Examiner of yesterday and a
good portion of the editorial page to let
ihe people of this City see how little
that organ knows of tbe history of San
Francisco. By devoting this amount of
space it endeavored to show that the citi
zens have a right to hold a special election
for freeholders and a special election for
a charter at any time, su>taining the posi
tion it assumed by quoting the opinions of
people of other cities in which such
elections were held.
San Francisco knew it had that power
lon* ago. On March 30, 1880, it held an
election, a special election, for freeholders
and at a special election held on the Bth of
September of the same year the work of
these freeholders was submitted to thÂ«
people, who voted as follows: For the
charter 4184, against 19,143. The general
election w:is held on the 2d of November
of the sjlme year.
It might be well for the young man who
rules the destinies of the tree-silver organ
to devote a little time to the study of the
Uity in which he is trying to run a paper.

to the efforts of that (treat metropolitan daily,

JUDICIOUS ADVERTISING.
Preparation cf dvrrtiiemenUâSrlection
of Medium* â Continuity.
Judicious advertising is the telling of your
business story in a striking, convincing man
ner to the largest number of the right kind of
people at the smaLest possible cost.
Two rocks upon which many unsuccessful
advertisers stumble are tne ineffective char
acter oi their advertisements and the injudi
cious selection of medium 3.
One of the most astonishing things in mod
ern business is the sight of a merchant buying
a hundred-dollar space in a newspaper and
then turning to a handy dry-goods box and
scratching off-hand, without a moment's
thought, his "copy" to fill the space. This is
the manner in which much of the advertising
space is filled. Would this same man thins oi
buying a hundred-dollar water case and put
ting inside of it a 25-cent movement ?
The wording and display ot advertisements
are generally the very .ast point considered. It
should bu the h'rst. Unless an advertisement
is effectively displayed (and by display I do
not mean tremendous type; plain reading, if
surrounded by large-type ads, would be good
display) it may no: be noticed at all among
the myriads of other advertisements. Unless
an advertisement is interestingly and con
vincingly written it will be valueless even
after having been read.
Finding tile proper mediumâ the medium
that will reach the largest number of the people
you desire to reach at the smallest possible
costâ this is probably the most d.flicult prob
lem the advertiser has to solve. To advertise
a cheap article, like working shues, ior in
stance, In a journal of "the four hundred," Is
sure to be unsatisfactory. To advertise
women's wearing apparel in papers wuich
reach only business meu will not be remuneia
tive. Yet these are common mistakes made
everyday. In placing his advertising every
businessman should investigate cureiully the
mediums under consideration. Circulationâ
the class and amount of it; price of space and
the comparison of it with other mediums of
the same kind, and not ieast, if last, the in
fluence oi the medium with the public; these
are the important points.
Wnen once the mediums are selected and the
advertising started, then comes the necessity
of doing it thoroughlyâ of keeping it up.
"Tlie strength of advertising," says N. C.
Fowler, "is in its continuity. Many a reader
sees tho Monday ad, forgets all about it, thinks
about it Tuesday and looks for it then. The
Monday paper is Â»ost, tire Tuesday Daper does
not contain It. He forgets it again and very
likely forever, because it he reaily wanted the
article advertised, he buys it of gome other
nrm who is then advertising."
It is the continual dropping of water that
wears away the stone. By keeping your ad
vertisement ever before the eyes of the reader
he will become so accustomed to your name
that when ne is in need of your wares he will
unconsciously turn his steps your way. To a
certain extent the constant appearance of n
man's name and business is an assurance oi
reliability.
A merchant told me a short time since that
he had iesu d advertising and found it did not
pay. On inquiry I louud ne had insertea in a
daily paper four six-inch single-column adver
tisements without position, the insertions be
ing five days apart. He received six calls
only that he could trace to the ads. In tne
same paper, not only for the same days, but
aUo on all dates between, I found the adver
tisement of his competitor occupying twice
the space in a superb position. This is mani
festly an unfair test.
But to sÂ»y that even the four advertisements
of this merchant did not pay is jumping at a
conclusion. Tne accumulative effect of ad
vertising Is one of Its peculiar phases. A single
new customer neves having been in the store
before comes iv in response to tUe advertise
ment. He makes a small purchase, is nicely
taken care of and frequently calls during the
year, making many purchases, probÃbly to
the extent of $150. Thefirstcos: to fi. id this
customer was $5, but the accumulative effect
produced by his continued patronage paid.
Advertising is not a side issue ot business.
It is an important link in the chain of trade
and should be studied and experimented upon
the same as any other department oÂ£ business.
And the sooner business men appreciate this
the sooner will their advertising, show re

.TRAVEL AND TALKâ By Rev. H. B. Haweis. i
.M.A., author of â¢â¢Thoughts for the Time*,"
"Music and Moras," etc. New York: i)odd,
Mead Â«JS Co. tor sale by William Doxey, Palace
Hotel, City: price, 2 volÂ«., $5
"Adieu! to San Francisco, with its bright
skies, its loyal, open-hearted citizens, its beau
tiful, sensible and sympathetic women, its
marvelous cable-cars and electric trams that
run up and down its perpendicular streets like
magicâ as the Chinamen say: 'No pushee, no
pullee, but go vera last much.' Adieu! the
busy mart and the bustling hotel, the crowded
church, the fraternal clergy, the pleasant so
cial gathering, the genial hospitality and the
inventive newspaper reporter."
! It is in these parting words that the Rev. H.
R. Haweis pays his respects to this City in his
recently published work entitled "Travel and j
â¢Talk,"- which purports to be a record of 100,
-000 miles of travel undertaken by the author
in the years 1555. 1893 and 1595. Mr. HawÂ«is
i.Â« well-known in this country, both as a cleric
and as a writer. ii is last book contains much
that is interesting and amu&ing to American
readers generally and to residents of the Paci
fic States in particular.
" The author of "Travel and Talk" evidently
came to this country prepared to criticize. To
a certain extent he has carried out his pur
pose. Americans oi a former generation re
â¢ member with bitterness their experience with
Charles Dickens, who was feted and lionized
â¢and made much oi in the Eastern cities of this
continent, yet returned to his native land and
penned his American Notes, wherein he
scathingly criticized Yankee manners and
customs. Mr. Haweis has registered his
â¢ opinions of our people, "out he has done so in
a rather gentler manner. While pointing out
â¢the crudities of American civilization, he is
careful to present our good points, and for
â¢ these mercies let us be thankful.
We shall take up in this review that portion
â¢ of* Mr. Haweis' diary having particulai rela
tion to San Francisco, for the reason that the
general line of criticism adopted by him to
ward the metropolis of the Pacific Coast is the
same as. that which he employs for every !
â¢ other city visited t>y him. He commences with
the Climate, that perennial subject introduced J
by the Californinn to the stranger within his
. gates, from whom unstinting admiration is
expected. Los Angeles, the c.ergyman found
".wretchedly co;d," and San FrancUco very
' damp. He says, however, that if he desired to
prolong his .lie he would probably take up his
residence at "San Ruffaeile." (The gentle
"reader is requested to note the spelling.)
'There is one point about which Caliiornians
have been much, misrepresented, and that is
their supposed sensitiveness to criticism.
This, Mr. Haweis thinks, is more imaginary
man real. "You can uiscuss with them," he
'says, "the state of the arts or education, and
ti:tre Will be little difference of opinion be
tween a cultivated European and an average
shrewd and educated Calliornian on such
â  matters. What they detest is lor peop.e who
have concealed their real opinion and flat
tered them up when in their midst to get
right away and then round upon them." Our
'author confesses that he has learned wisdom
ii> America aud hence has fail to share the
fate of Mrs. Kendal and Lottie Collins of "Jay
Town" fame.
y Civic corruption on the Pacific Coast comes
in for a share of amusing comment. Tne Lou
don clergyman professes to have a vast and
- abounding admiration for Mayor Sutro, whom
.. be Call* the grand old man of j San Francisco.
He thus describes the historical mass-meeting
held at Metropolitan Temple:
"At that meeting the best speakersâ men of
position, Senators, Judges of - the Supreme
Court, etc., indulged in such amenities as
â¢Jobsou is a ihiei' ; 'Bounder is a perjurer';
â¢E.der Smut is the owner of bad houses, 4
street'; 'Grasper was turned out of Bunkum's
office for robbing the till'; 'Sinker is a liar,'
and 'O'Siieakum forged a will' â sentiments
â¢ received with uproarious applause, some of
. the incriminated parties being present and
smiling around blandly."
A pleasant chapter or two is devoted to
Christmas in San Francisco. Our methods of
celebrating the birthday of the founder of a
great faith met with the strong approbation of
Mr. Hiiweis. As he expresses it, it is "sound
to the core." Further than this, he remarks:
- "This go-ahead country, this materialistic,
money-grubbing ' Frisco is in matters of reli
gion and of 'use and wont' the most con
servative and sentimental place I was ever in.'
The Christmas high and low jinks of the
Bohemian Club were matters of marvel to the
anithorof "Travel aud Talk." In passing he
takes occasion to comment upon the fact that
the rowdy element that is apt to creep into
such clubs in London was conspicuous by its
. absence In San Francisco. "This guild of
Frisco's wit and wisdom, whose symbol is an '
owl with one eye winked, has gathered in by
a kind of magnetic attraction all the e-iprits
ftps of the Cityâ lawyers, actors, writers, doc
tors and artists meet in Bohemia on common
ground. * * â¢ Boisterous, rollicking, effu
sive to the point of an almost Celtic senti
mentality, but rowdy, coarse, risqueâ No!"
It will tnus have been seen that, viewed in
at .least two most important aspects, San Fran
cisco, so far from being behind the metropolis
â¢ of. the Old World, is acknowledged by a promi
nent London divine, scholar, writer and stu
dent oi huma.i nature to be far ahead oi it.
â¢la the reception accorded to the Christmas
festival Englishmen have from time imme
morial considered themselves to be pre
eminent. The yule log, with its accompani
ment of Santa Claus and general merry
making, has by many been accepted as suggest
ing English hosp.Uhty and English senti
ment. Vet here is an eminent Englishman
who feels it incumbent on him to confess that
the Californian's welcome to Christmas is at
least as warm and as pleasant. "On the
â whole," concludes the auti.or of -Travel and
Talk,' "I think it would improve some of our
E glish pessimists to come over here and get
i their English sourness. knocked out of them
and a little San Francisco merriment knocked
into them about Christmas time. They would
have a better chance of beginning a 'Happy
new year.'"
As for English clubs, who will deny that
they have ever been regarded, both by the
conservative Briton and the outsider, as em
blematic of English solidity and English re- j
spectability. But if we are to believe Mr. '
Haweis, who certainly ought to know, there
exists a certain "rowdy element which is apt
to creep Into London clubs, which was con
spicuous by i:s' f absence in San Francisco."
Surely, then, we can dry the tear caused by
the wounds inflicted upon our pride by act
resses to whom our theater-goers have pre
sented the cold shoulder.
-â  A visit to the Stanford and Leland. (sic) Uni
versity and a lecture to the students in attend
ance is one of the recorded events of Mr.
Haweis' trip to the coast. Of the scholars he
has this to say:
' "The students, as at Cornell, are male and
female, singularly free, self-reliant and inde
pendent. They live all ; about at their own
sweet will. â¢ * â¢ 1 could see from my
platform crowds of students of both sexes
standing at the open doors, and the young
men climbed up outside aud looked in at the
open windows. I have those hundreds of
iresh youiiÃ eager faces before me still. 1 had
been told that infidelity and materialism were
here rampant and that many of the teachers
were openly agnostic or skeptical. Very likely
1 felt strangely overcom--; my heart went out
to them; i hey seemed to be as sheep without
a shepherd, with their feet stumbling on the
dark mountains. California may be sensual,
materialistic, skeptical, superficial; but Caii
fornians are full of heart and the young
people with small respect for precedent and
convention are wonderfully receptivo and
eager."
Of the newspaper press in San Francisco, and
In America generally, Mr. Haweis has not a
very hign opinion. This is evidenced by his
chronicling the fact that be felt himself under
ob gations to the proprietor of his hotel for
guarding him from "visitors, reporters and
bores." His antipathy to the press arose.it
seems, from the fact that some correspondence
relating to his preaching in a nonconformist
plnce of worship got into the papers. In fact,
all through the present work he has been at
borne pains to manifest his contempt for tbe
writing craft. There arc those who have said
that Mr. Haweis did not consider his im
portance sufficients accentuated by the New
York papers upon bis landing this side of the
Atlantic, though this may be only a malicious
report.
"Travel and Talk" is In some respects a
brilliant book. There is much in it that is
witty, bright and sparkling, but there are
pluces where it is spoiled by the spirit of self
sufficiency manifested by its author. Mr.
Haweis is possessed of no desire to hide his
light under a bushel, and the all-important
ego Is continually stru?gliug to assert HselL
A glance at that portion of his book devoted
to the Eastern States reveals numerous inac
curacies, which cannot be passed under
cover of the excuse that the book was hastily
written. He makes the astounding assertions,
for instance, that the literary set in Boston
did not recognize Bryant; that Harriet
Beecher Stowe had little or nothing to do with
the anti-slavery agitation; and. finally, that
Emerson did cot admire Wan Whitman. The
veriest tyro in literary matters knows these
statements to be incorrect.
To conclude, Mr. Haweis should remember
that the San Francisco press concerns itself
with far more important matters than the un
seemly squabbles of clergymen, visiting or
resident. He should not lay against any sec
tion of this country the charge of "money
grubbing" and in the same breath make elab
orate estimates of what his lectures are worth
to a church at 50 cents per auditor. He should
not publish letters which upon their faces
bear the stamp of privacy; and, finally, he
should "read, mark and inwardly digest" that
portion of Ptaim xv descriptive of the man
"that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor
doeth evil unto his neighbor, nor taketh up a
reproach against his neigh Dor."

SANTA CLATTS' UOMh. By Helen M. Cleveland.
Boston, Mass. : Arena Publishing Co. Price 60c
The Christmas book season is now fairly
j upon us and many are the candidates present
; ing themselves for favor in tne literary line.
One of the best children's books we have seen
up to the time of writing is "Santa Claus'
Home," by Helen M. Cleveland.
The short stories herein are selected with an
earnest desire to furnish mothers with stories
to read aloud to their children, and also for
young children to read to themselves; and the
rhymes are chosen with a special desire to
give something suitable for small children to
sing and speak in school.
This book should have a wide circulation
and should be specially considered for supple
mentary reading in our schools, as well as for
the entertainment of the child at home.

The story of an apostle of humanity is here
told. The book is a reprint, but "Joshua
Wray" was much commented upon when it
was first published in 1892. The now popular
trade schools for the training of our youth for
employment in mechanical pursuits are
claimed in this book to have had their origin
in the practical, unassuming efforts along that
line of the man who is represented iv the
character of Joshua Wray.

Will he never stoop and say,

Like a child iroin too much play;
"Kiss me iv the dear old way?"
Nay! I cannot think It so.
He will come to me, I know,

He will come, or I will go.

The Macmillan Company, in order to prevent
confusion, and, as far as possible to anticipate
further questions, Is calling attention to the
fact that the title of Miss Margaret Sherwood's
new book, which was announced as "An Ex
perimeut in Egotism" has been changed to "A
Puritan Bohemia." The reason for the change
is not mentioned, but is supposedly due to the
idea that the first presents a too strong anti
thesis to the title of an earlier book, also pub
lished by tl:e Macmillans, named "An Experi
ment in Altruism." The Bohemia described is
iv one of the great studio buildings, found in
almost any large city, wherein women do their
life's-work as art teachers, students or artists
with varying degrees of success, but with com
pensations in independence and pleasant com
panionships.
The completion of Herbert Spencer's system
nf philosophy is announced by his publishers,
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. As first stated, this
division of the Synthetic Philosophy was to
be treated in two volumes, but in their pre
paration the amount of matter grew to such
proportions that a third voiume became neces
sary. This contains Part VI. Ecclesiastical In
stitutions; Part VII, Professional Institutions;
and Part VIII, Industrial Institutions. la
view of the numerous changes, beneficent and
otherwise, that have been going on in the in
dustrial world within recent years, the ap
pearance of this closing section has been
eagerly- looked for m many quarters. It will
be found to be fully up to the high standard of
Mr. Spencer's precedlne work, and to shed a
strong light on current industrial problems.
It was long ago admitted there is nothing
new under the sun and that especially of the
art of bookniaking there is no end, but Charles
Whibley's "A Book of Scoundrels," published
by the Macmillan Company, is anything but
commonplace. He describes the careers and
achievements of certain notorious malefactors
who have been chosen for presentment on ac
count of their style nnd picturesqueness. They
are of all ages and several countries, and, that
variety may not be lacking, Cartouche and
Peace, Moll Cutpurse and the Abbe Bruneau
come within the same covers. Where it has
se-med convenient the method of Plutarch is
followed and the style and method of two
similar scoundrels are contrasted in a "par
allel." Jack Sheppard in the stoneroom of
Newgate, reproduced from an old print, serves
as a frontispiece.
The Review of Reviews for November is a
strong issue. American polities are discussed
in an able manner, while the European situa
tion is not neglected. Among the prominent
articles in this number are: "A Summing Up
of the Vital Issues of 1896," by Rev. Lyman
Abbott; "Method 3 and Tactics of the Cam
piign; Would Free Coinage Benefit Wage-
E.rners?" (affirmative, Dr. Charles B. Spahr;
negative, Professor Richmond Mayo Smith);
"George Dv Maurlei," by Ernest Knaufft;
"The Eastern Ogre or St. George to the
Rescue," by W. T. Stead.
The Review of Reviews maintains its posi
tion as one of the leading if not the leading
monthly magazine published in this country.
It is simply indispensable to every one who
desire to keep posted on matters literary,
financial and political.
'â¢The Story of the Mine" is tlie title of an
important new book, by Charles Howard
Shinn, which will be published immediately
by D. Appleton & Co. in the Story of the West
Series, edited by Ripley Hitchcock. The
figures of the prospecior and the miner are
ciearly outlined in the course of the romantic
story of that natural treasure-house which
more than any other embodies the romance,
the vicissitudes, the triumphs, the excitement
and the science of mining life â the great
Comstock lode. Frcm tne prospector, through
devc opineut and deep-mining, to the last of
the stock gambling, the story is loid in a way
thai prtsei.ts a singularly vivid and engross
ing picture of a life which has played so large
a part in the development of the remoter
West. While this book, in accordance with
the plan of this successful series, has a lasting
h>siorical value, it will be found to possess a
peculiar interest at the present time.

lo.irteemh street. For sale at all bookstores;
price, 2 vois., if 3.
This work has now passed through no less
than a score of editions, which is an attest to
its popularity. It was originally translated by
Mrs. Carey in 1889, and it immediately took
rank as a standard historical work.
To the present edition Professor J. Franklin
Jameson has written an introductory notice
and a continuation to the year 1896. in the
former he states his belief that no better his
tory could have been chosen as a basis for an
abridged translation than that of M. Duruy.
In this opinion he is confirmed by Professor
Andrew D. White of Cornell, while to even the
most inexperienced eye it is evident that ex
traordinary peins have been taken by trans
lator and publisher to make these volumes of
permanent value as works of reference. They
will be found by students to be accurate, and
the ceneral reader will also perceive their
worth as an acquisition to his bookshelves.
BLUE AN^ GRaY ON LAND.
ON THE STAFF. By "Oliver Optic." Boston:
Lee A uhepard. For sale at all bookstores: price
This volume is the fourth in the series of
"The Blue and the Grayâ on Land," and carries
the hero of the preceding volumes, Dick Lyon,
in his new position as a staff t fflcer, Into new
and fresh fields, and amia scenes of a more
stirring nature. The long and rap.d march of
the army under Buell to the assistance of
Grant at Shiloh, the desperate conflict and
final victory of Pittsburg Landing, and the
march to ana siege of Corinth are all fully de
scribed.
In those days history was made day by day,
and boys were transformed into men In a
single night. Dick's position was not an ex
ceptional one for the times, and he maae the
best use of it, gaining the respect and praise of
his superior officers and another step in rank
ere the volume closes.
In these volumes Mr. Adams conveys to the
youthful readers of the present day a realistic
view of the exciting scenes and events of that
memorable National period. The main inci
dents are historically correct, and Oliver Op
tic's fascinating fashion of clothing the facts
of history in the garb of fiction is here delight
fully set forth. Sturdy patriotism is tne key
note of the motive of these tales, and the
author inculcates in a convincing yet alluring
manner the great lessons of honor, duty and
love of country.
They will help to fire the young of the
present day with something of the patriotic
enthusiasm that thrilled their fathers' hearts
during that dark period in the history of their
country.
ART INFORMATION.
A MANUAL FOR CHINA PAINTERS. Being
a practical and < omprehenslve treatise on the art
of paintlns china and glass with mineral colors.
l'.y Mrs. N. I>l It. ilouactiesi. Boston: Lee &
bheparu. Price $1 25.
This is one of the most thorough and com
plete manuals for china painters ever prepared,
containing practical directions for every step;
and offering such Instruction and suggestions
in the use of mineral colors as will enable
amateurs to pursue this beautiful art by them
selves. Abundant information is given in
reference to materials, which includes colors,
brushes, mediums, etc., and how to use them
Valuable suggestions are furnished as to the
requirements of decorative art and useful
hints follow on the correct designs for table
ware. In short, nothing pertaining to this art
seems to have been omitted that could aid the
student, and the author says, in her Introduc
tion, the book contains such information as
she sorely needed herself while learning to
paint on china.
Mrs. Monachesi has had large experience in
practically and theoretically demonstrating
her familiarity with this art, both with her
brush and pcn â having already acquired a
reputation from her contributions to various
art journals â and is considered an authority
on Keramics. The color plates showing the
exact Lacroix colors make a most valuable
addition to the Manual. Their correctness is
assured by the fact that they were made in
Paris by Lacroix himself especially for this
book.
AN INDIAN WAR STORY.
TECTMSEH'S YOTTNO BRAVES. By Everett
i. Tomlinson. Boston: i.cc & bhepard; price
fl 50.
Mr. Tomlinson shifts the scene of action in
this new volume in the "War of 1812 Feries"
taking up the story of the Creek war, bringing
his readers into a closer knowledge of one of
the bravest of the historical Indian characters.
Stories of the Indians, especially that of
Tecumsch, have always been of intense in
terest, and become doubly so when presented
in this author's attractive style. His treat
ment of the Indian story is such that the book
can be placed in the hands of our young
people without a fear that they will be in
duced to start for the West to emulate the
heroic deeds of Old Tlppecanoe and Kit Car
son. Not but that tne book contains enough
exciting incident and adventure to satisfy
any one, but It is also true to the history of
those stirring times, which has been much
neglected hitherto by our story-writers. The
lesson conveyed by the story is one that
should be impressed upon every young
American.
TRIBUTE TO DU MAURIER.
The English papers are filled with tributes
to, and reminiscences of, the late George dv
Maurier. To a writer in the Daily Mail he
said: "This 'Tnlby' boom distresses me when
I think that Thackeray never had a 'boom.'
And I hold that means nothing as a sign of
literary excellenceâ nothing but money."
Another writer in the same paper, who signs
himself "An Old Friend," says that early in
his career Dv Maurier worked for the S. P. C.
X., and was well satisfied to receive $20 for a
drawing on wood, and more than satisfied if
he had orders for two of these blocks in a
week. Ever since he lost the sight of one eye
in 1857, the great dread of Dv Manner's life
was blindness. He would describe with haunt
ing horror how he would wake at night and
stare into the darkness and wonder if it was
only the blackness of the night, or the dark
ness that has no dawn.
Encouraged by his friend, Henry James, Dv
Manrier wrote "Peter Ibbetson." "I usually
wrote," he said, "on the top of the piano,
standing. I rarely looked at my manuscript
as I wrote, partly to spare my eyes and partly
because the writing seemed literally to flow
from my pen. I thought it a modest little
tale when it was finished, and with the ureat
est delight accepted the Harpers' offer for it
of Â£500, with another Â£500 ior the drawings
in illustration.'*
Then came "Trilby." "Of the mechanism of
the story," Dv Maurier said, "I can tell you
nothing. The story formed itself. I had al
ways a leaning toward the weird and mystical.
My father was a great musician. I myself had
a passion for song. So the mysterious, the
occult and music took their place in it by
right of natural descent. The name had
struck me as one with a fortune in it. It was
none oi my inventing. Charles Nodler had
written a romance with a Trilby In it. Alfred
de Musset had composed a sonnet to Trilby.
But it fitted my heroine and I adopted it. I
think I must havo felt as happy as Thackeray
did when the title of 'Vanity Fair' suggested
itself to him. At any rate, I at once said to
myself, 'That is a name which will sell a
book."' Never did he speiik a truer word.
The name was fin inspiration.
Of the generosity cf the Messrs. Harrer, his
publishers, Dv Maurier was always ea?er to
speak. "As a boy I wo^hiped Byron," he
would say, "his fire, his wit. his audacity.
But in the light of my own experience, I can't
forgive him thÃt one cruel line, -Now i'.nrabbas
was a publisher.' From the first they had
faith In 'Trilby.' I looked for no greater suc
cess than with 'Peter Ibbetson,' which I havo
always thoutht the better book. But they
began by offering me double the 'Ibbetson'
terms. 1 thought it royal trertment and ac
cepted. Then they begged me to reconsider
my decision, accept a little less Â»nd retain an
interest in the book. I pinned no great faith
to 'Trilby's' grenadier coat, however, and sail,
'No.' Two thousand birds in the hand were
good enough lor me. But directly the -boom'
assumed magnificent proportions, the Harpers
voluntarily destroyed our agreement nnd ar
ranged to allow me a handsome royalty oa
every copy of the book.'â The Critic.
SLANG rROM IHICAGO
I thought I had touched the bottom of slang
when I read Henry M. Blossom's "Checker,"
writes George C. Jenks in the November
"Ev'ry Month." But here's another. His
name is George Ade, and he owns a cobble
stone in Chicago. His book, "Artie: A Story
of the Streets nnd Town," just out, is odd.
Listen to "Artie's" deEeriptiq/i of an incident
at a dance out on the prairie. He had been
cutting out a member of the floor committee
with his girl, and this is what happened:
"Finally his rabi with the banner on his
coat comes around and begins to roast her.
Sore? You never see a man so sore. * * *
You had ought o' seen me. I put up a bluff
that'd curl your hair. I went up to him and
I breathed it right in his ear. I leaned against
him. 'Look here,' I says, 'You screw right
away from here. V>'e don't like your style.
If you open your face to this lady again to
night I'll separate you from your breath.' Did
he go? Well, I should say yes. He didn't
want none o' my came."
Herbert S. Stone & Co., who published
"Checkers," are also the sponsors of "Artie."
I do not blame them lor it, lor there Is some
thing so deliciously funny in spontaneous
slang when coupled with real humor that the
volume is sure to sell. "Artie" originally ap
peared in a series of sketches in a Chicago
newspaper. But they are excelently well
deserving the dignity of book-covers.
INTERESTING, IHOUGd LOGMATK
THE BIBLE AND ITS READERS. By Eva
Scheellne. Published by P. j. Healy, Powell
street, San Francisco. lor sale a all bookstores.
This is a little work by a local writer. Its
title is self-explanatory. Peculiarly dogmatic
in its tone.it stateo nothing that is new; yet
withal it is interestingly written, and the
author appears to have a good command of
vigorous English.
The work devotes some space to a considera
tion of the snug and comfortable "after din
ner theory of inspiration." After thus char
acterizing a theory, the author proceeds to
elaborate the description, remarking that it is
the belief of those who hold it that "every
sentence, word, syllable and letter in the Bible
Is the word of God."
For those who hold this belief the author
has scant respect. "No sane man," she re
marks, "believes or can believe that oil tha
Bible is inspired. There arc- falsehoods in tiie-
Bible, words of b id men, and even of good
men in bad moods. Hence, the man who still
believes is compelled to reject the after-dinner
theory. Many people never make a revision of
their belief, but steadily scorn the whole book.
This theory of inspiration is the fertile parent
of infidels, atheists and agnostics."
The extracts quoted will present to the read
er's mind a fairly good idea of the contents of
this little volume. For the rest it can be said
that the work is plainly presented in language
that is forcible and understandable.

This Is a retrint of one of Alphonse Daudet's
works from the press of J. M. Dent & Co.,
London. It forms part of the series of the
French author's books, printed and bound
uniformly, the others issued so far being
"Tartarin of Tarascon" and "Tartarin of the
Alps." We have already taken occasion to
a peak of the artistic get-up of this edition, and
can only add that the present work is equally
well printed, buund and illustrated. A sketch
of the author by L. Rossi makes a pretty
frontispiece to "Robert ileirnont."

Rare Gowns Worn by Queens of Fashion.
Only general remarks have thus far been
made concerning the Czarina's beautiful
robes which excited admiration in critical,
art-loving Paris. At the dinner given at
the Elysee, which was followed by a visit
to the opera, theEmyress wore a glace
silk, pale blue in hue. The rarest and
most exquisite lace adorned it; the train
was very long. The following evening
her costume was equally worthy cf imita
tion, being of a delicate rose satin elabor
ately embroidered with pearls; creamy
lace formed a niche around the low cut
neck. On all occasions her jewels, espe
cially her diamonds, were simply niaer.ifi
cent. When visiting the Louvre her toilette
of pearl gray broadcloth was completed
v.ith a white capote trimmed with violets.
The extreme simplicity of this dress was
admirable. 1
At an afternoon fete she appeared in a
siiu of a delightful pinkish lilac shade and
a toque composed of light violets and a
white aigrette. At another dinner this
attractive woman elected to be garbed in
a gorgeous white brocade with a very
lengthy train. At the review at Chalons
she looked radiant in an elegant costnme
of peacock blue silk, with collet cape of
the same, bordered with Eable and a
capote to match the dress. Mme.Faure wore
during the imperial party's stay several
gowns most favorably commented on;
for instance, one was an ivory velvet
frappe, with black and colored bouquets;
the skirt was plain and the bodice had
revers and white lace; capote of mauve
glace velvet, with pink aigrette and chou.
At a dinner party most becoming was
her robe of silvery gray satin. At an after
noon reception Mile. Faure wore gray
velvet made with a pretty bolero, literally
covered with gold embroidery, the cein
ture was of gray silk chiffon, and her hat
of blue velvet, with an aigrette and a
cache peigne of blue and violet marguer- J
ites. Her sister, lime. Berge, was in beige ,
velvet frappe, with flowers in a darker '
shade; close-ritting bodice, with revers of
ivory satin embroidered with gold in the
empire style; black satin corselet with'
large strass buttons and sash of laurel- j
green. The sleevea long and plain, but
draped en panillon on the shoulder. In I
the evening Mme. Berpe appeared in a
pretty dress of pale blue faille, with
corselet of darker blue velvet embroidered
with gold and silver in raised work, and
round the shoulders a fall of point d'An
gleterre. The dresses worn by Mme. Faure
and her danghters on the various occa-
Bions were manufactured expressly at
Lyons, and made up by Laferriere.
Worn by Tljeatep Queens.
Truly superb were two of the creations
worn by actresses at the Theater Francais
on the occasion of the Czar and Czarina's
visit. Mme. Bartet wa3 attired in a mag
nificent white satin covered with an ap
plique of lace embroidered with silver and i
pearls. At her waist was a clasp repre- {
tenting a Itussian eagle in diamonds.
The small lace sleeves had rows of sable
running around them.
Mme. Baretta in white Mechlin lace
over pink moire, with a narrow row of
Bable around the hem and pelisse of white
moire covered with seed pearls and silver i
embroidery, was both artistic and beauti
ful, and the divine Sarah, who recited at
Versailles, was wonderfully appareled in
a grand conception of thick white damas
embroidered with feathers, outlined with j
diamonds and opals, low bodice draped !
with lBce, and the .Russian eagle in the
front with the imperial crown in diamonds
and pearls.
A recent Paris bride wore a gown of
ivory satin. The ekirt was plain and
trimmed; the bodice, a la Valois, was
adorned with bullion tulle, and a row
of orange blossoms surrounded the neck
band.
At this wedding several toilettes of rare
elegance excited much admiration and
great were the varieties in styles. For ex
ample, the groom's mother was gowned
in a long-trained skirt of the richest black
saiin, lined with violet taffeta glace, the
ruille being accordion pleateJ, edged with
black lace. The close-fitting bodice had a
corseiet belt and revers embroidered with
amethysts, guimpe of crepe embroidered
in gold and violet; the same crepe formed
the capp, which had a knot of brilliants
and a mauve aigrette. The bride's mother
was a picture in a Louis XVI robe. "The
skirt was of sky-bine brocade broche with
Bbadeu carnations, close-fitting bodice with
lace jabot and bolero of moss-gieen velvet
enhanced with old point lace. Mme. de
Carnoxvsky wore blue brocbe satin, the [
bodice ornamented with appliques of !
Bruges lace, embroidered with silver: I
capote of the same lace with sapphire
blue velvet crown and white aierette. An
other pretty dress was Pompadour silt,
vert d'eau ground with pattern or rose 3
all over, bolero of gieen velvet with pink
tinted Jace. The small capote was of the ]
same lace, with a white aigrette and Jarge
black velvet bow.
It is no lonrer fashionable, I am happy I
to say, for our mothers to appear in sub- j
stantial black or pray silk, with the tradi
tional collar or frill of lace at the throat.
Instead they are quite as exqui- j
sitely and tastefully garbed as their !
pretty daughters and wear what- j
ever colors or shades that suit them |
best and the richest and rarest of em- j
broideries, laces, etc. Women should re
member that "they are no older than they
look," and should take every precaution !
to look not a year older than absolutely
necessary. Maecella.
Ligfot Colors in Winter .Modes
The world ct fashion will feel through
out its length and breadth this influence,
as in Paris it has created a great demand
for light-hued winter fabrics, as, for in
stance, light beige cloth, incrusted with
guipure and bordered with tiny jet
spangles and beads, will be worn for
dressy occasion?, such as matinees and
marriages. White cloth Is also now em
ployed by several of the great dressmakers
for the elegant costumes being evolved.
One of these tit least should be . described,
so I sfilect the daintiest.
The skin is embroidered at the hem in
an ivy-leaf design in white and cold. The
blouse is in white mirror velvet, opening
over a chemisette of Irish point upon
white s.itin. Over this is a short bolero,
with rounded embroidery, which forms a
very novel and effective trimming. This
bolero is open at the back as hiqb as the
collar, whieli; like the waist ribbon, the
revers and cuffs, is in maize-colored vel
vet. For small dinner parties cloth prom
ises to be very popular trimmed with
zibeline. Not many years ago this fashion
enjoyed a great vogue.
Very fetching is another creation from
a big house. "Jt is a beautiful Louis XIV
brocaded silk, trimmed with graceful and
becoming revers in velvet, slightly full at
the shoulders, nhowin? the white-satin
lining, and finished off with a narrow bor
der of feathers. The same trimming or
naments the skirt and the collar. The
upper part of the bodice is composed of
cream guipure, which can be removed a
volonte. according to the occasion for
which the dress is required."
Wide collarettes of zibeline made upon
a zigzag of wire are worn with a fall of

j polonaises will be much in vosue for tho*e
who prefer bodice and skirt alike, but the
blouses are so convenient we cannot quite
give them up, but they will be closer fitting.
and much ornamented. The bodices of
the polonaises, though fitting at the waist,
will be bouffant toward the top, and
covered with ornaments above the bust,
the sleeves long and close, falling over the
band, with epaulette or bouffant, or some
thing puffy, at the thoulder. Figaros
more than ever, separate from and as
auxiliary to the bodice, and richly trimmed
or embroidered. Buttons will be much
worn, placed everywhere, without the
least idea of being used or useful, only as
ornamtnts. These buttons are topazes,
amethysts and turquoises, either real or
well imitated in colored glass, and set in
gold or silver; openwork steel is alsdnuch
used, but the prettiest are Egyptian in
style and resemble jeweled beetles.
Donovan and .Maueliepet.
And what do you suppose Donovan's
very latest gown is composed of? Simply
of baby lamb. The skirt is full and the
coat is short and pleated and has a very
handsome vest of ermine. The cuffs and
revers are of orange velvet, and although
we are not bo informed, the costume is
doubtless lined throughout with an orange
hued silk. A rich heavy lace overlays the
inner collar; jet bands. A good-sized bow
of black satin tied ala cravat is chic at
the waist line. At the left side is quite a
large bow of black satin, with ends that
reach to within aboui ten inches of the
bottom of the skirt. The gloves worn
with this are stitched with black, and the
black velvet hat and its great sweeping
bunch of cock's feathers is assuredly effec
tive. But although Donovan is simply
raved over by many New Yorkers, I can
didly admit that there are two
dressmakers here at least who certainly
create quite as chic models. Indeed,
many San F raunisco women have been
sadly disappointed with their New York
gowns, and one of our social autocrats who
is one of the best gowned of women on
leaving lately for her Eastern home had
quite a number of lovely toilets made up
here, and since then she has written to
friends saying that her frocks compared
most favorably with any she has seen.
Women make a great mistake who leave
home for a visit, of a month or so with the
intention of having all necessary garments
made while in New York or elsewhere, as
if they patronize fashionable dressmakers
they will not receive their clothes until it
is about time to return home, and as a
natural result cannot fully enjoy their
visit owing to being conscious that they
are not properly turned out.
Maucheret has furnished Vogue with de
signs for morning, afternoon and evening.
First is described a calling-costume of
sapphire-blue velvet trimmed with ap
plique lace, coffee colored. JUuch black
jet is employed, not only on the bodice
but on the skirt as well ; four lines extend !
directly down the front, and from them |
radiate twelve short lines which terminate I
with handsome circular ornaments. The !
sleeves are extremely ugly, and excepting
for a very tall and slender woman the high
serrated collar and the double revers would
be most unfortunate in their results.
Rather effective is a reception dres3 of a
pearl-gray ladies' cloth, with a collar of |
ruby velvet embroidered in Turkish pat
tern in gold and silver. Three narrow
folds of the velvet trim the skirt and the
same number the sleeves, which extend
far over the hands. The neckband and
corselet are of soft folds of th 3 velvet.
From Maucheret's also comes a theater
wrap in a cloth turquoise blue in color,
adorned with liroad bands of silk-em
broidered roses and buds. Down the front
extends a panel of white lace, across
which are bands of the cloth, held in place
by twcÂ» ornamental buttons. Round the
throat is a lull ruche of chiffon.
I rather like two other New York gowns.
One is a debutante's frock of shell-pink
crepe de chine, trimmed with pink chiffon j
plisse. A sash of pink taffeta encircles the !
waist and is carried up the back until it
reaches between the shoulders, and there
it ties in a large bow, the ends of which
reach the skirt's bottom around the low
cut bodice, and around the hips are many
rows of shirring, and the sleeves are in the
model too bouffant to be considered abso
lutely new. From the same dressmaker
is a young girl's dress of dark-green cloth,
trimmed with apniique of the same shade
of velvet embroidered and outlined in jet.
The yoke a>nd lining to the epaulettes are
of white satin, the former being embroid
ered in jet, steel and popper. The very
high stock and high-draped belt are of
black velvet bound with green.
Tfypee Redfepn Gowns.
While at Balmoral the Empress of Russia
ordered from Redfern three verj r excellent
gowns. One is composed of a "zouave and
skirt in petunia faced cloth; the zouave,
handsomely emDroidered in self-colored |
cord, is worn over a blouse in the same
color of surah silk; the yoke is prettily
mocked, from which the fullness falls
straight to the waist, being confined by a
deep-draped sash. The sleeves are closely
rucked from shoulder to wrist."
The second has a "coat and skirt in a
deep shade of petunia faced cloth. The
coat, smartly cut in the double-breasted
shape, has a collar of velvet, the revers
being edged with a narrow braided design
in a fancy silk cord of the same color.
The 3ame cord is employed on the orna
mentation of the hem of the plain skirt,
cut in the latest shape. With this costume
is worn a soft silk waistcoat, draped with
a jabot effect. The revers are tastefully
cut and the effect of the velvet collar is
excellent."
Most simple is the third and last, for the
"coat and skirt are in biacK and white
tweed, quite simply made, the coat open
ing with long revers showing the plain
close-fitting waistcoat of the same ma
terial. Marcki.la.
Fashions Fop Men.
Positively the political excitement dur
ing the past few days has been so great
that 1 almost overlooked the fact that
The Call's subscribers expected to be
kept posted concerning the latest styles in
ties, coats, trousers, etc. However, as
many have been awaiting the result of the
election to give their winter orders, I will
at once give you the result cf my observa
tions. We are infoimed monthly now
that green and red tweeds are fashionable;
nevertheless, none of the smartly attired
men pay any visible attention to this an-
nouncement. Evening coats with velvet
collars continue to be regarded as ex
tremely bad form. A New York corre
spondent writes us that "a few of the hunt
ing youngsters will appear at all hour 3 at
fashionable restaurants in the very start
line plaid velvet waistcoats, which I must
confess are a!*o beyond me. Well, they
will all vanish once the horse show is
over."
There is a decided tendency this winter
to use rough cloths for overcoats, and
beaver is preferable to melton. A well
built overcoat should be moderately loose,
have a fly front and be single-breasted. It
should reach to about two inches below
the knee, and have twa outside pockets
and a small one also for tickets; they
should have no flaps, and the pockets
should be one on each side of the coat, but
not a breast one. Those not in mourning
prefer dark brown beaver to black or blue.
Concerning evening dress, says the
highest authority : "There is but little i!
any change in the cut and length of the
coat. It it. faced with silk, which extends
to the lapels. It is plain,*anrl not braided.
! The skins will be cut away a little more,
j ainl the corner rounded. Th < tails will
j come to just about the inside bend of the
! knee. White waistcoats will be worn
almost universally with evening dress.
The smartest ones are double-breasted and
two buttons deep, with a very pronounced
"v" shape, nround which there is a thin
collar. The trousers are cut fairly looso
I to the leu. If you prefer to wear the waist
coat of the same material as the suit, it
should be single-breasted, but cut in the
same fashion. Remember that a white
waistcoat is a dillicult thing to lit, and if
you can afford, have these made to order.
They should, according to sorce authori
ties, never be launuertd; if they are, they
should not bo starched, only ironed."

r
Well, Jack, Frances and I had our
heart's desire last night. We were behind
the scenesâ really talked with the actors
and- saw them making whiskers and put
ting'on grease paint. It was heaps of
fun.-
Oh, whew! I wish your cigar was more
. expensive.
Why, Jack, don't you know, actors
aTerever so much like every-day people?
.What d.d I don't know. I
gaess something different. But to begin.
We went first to see Mr. Friedlander and
told him we wished to inspect the dress
ing"-rooms of his theater.
'â¢Why, with pleasure," he said, "and
you'll find none better in the land."
' By the way, he's tickled to death that
>IcKinley's elected. Now, don't frown.
You'd better take off that white necktieâ
here's a yellow one. Then Mr. Fried
lander whistled through a tube and told
Tom, the stage doorkeeper, to admit and
Bhow -us everything.
'We went round and Tom ushered us inâ
of course, Frances had to trip on the
stairway and then giggle. I told her to
stop, as giggling wasn't becoming to in
spectors. Well, we went through a sort of
baggage depository directly to the sacred
precincts of the actors. The members of
tne "Tennessee's Pardner" company are
Ike a happy family, but most of them
wjere on the stage, and so we had an ex
cellent view of the rooms â eight large
ones, warmly carpeted, shelves, cup
boards, running water, electric lights, and
so forth. But we were anxious to talk to
â¢ BomÂ« one, so Frank Kelly (ne's the stage
â¢manager of the company) introduced us
to Harry Maiuhall. He hadn't fin
i Mied making up, but Frances asked
.;m how he liked the apartments
provided for the players in the
Columbia Theater. His features immedi
ately lighted up with a Dnght, satisfied
smile.
"How do I like them? Why, im
â¢ mensely ! They are comfortable, well ven
tilated and clean, and remind one of a
â neatly furnished fiat with all modern im
provements, the very latest improvement
being cleanliness. Just thinK, there is a
window in each room letting in God'sown
fresh air. What a luxury thut is when we
are used to being cooped up in rooms that
are" foul from bad ventilation â amid
grewsome odors," he continued, as he
deftly glued on his mustache. "We very
often have to dress on trunks. Whoever
has the largest trunk has the most com
modious dressing-room ; and then we have
.to view ourselves from tip to toe in a hand
mirror. Four years ago I played in a
stock theater in the East for three months
where the flooring of my room was actu
aily rotting. In consequence I contracted
'â¢ malaria and have suffered from it ever
since. 'Man wants but little here below, 1
but I insist on cleanliness, plenty of chlo
ride of iinie, a nice looking-glass and,
above all, a wholesome smell."
Just then the pieasant voices of thequar
tet broke in upon us. Mr. Mainhall heard
.his cue, and with a pieased-to-have-met
you-ladies bow he rushed away to make
his .entrance on the stage, and our chat
was concluded. However, Mr. Kelly es
corted us to the exitâ hels so gentlemanly,
you knowâ and volunteered his opinion,
which, to quote him, was: "My experience
.has been long and varied, and 1 consider
" the Columbia Theater dressing-rooms gems
of comfort and the best in America out
-side the Avon . Theater in Pittsburgâ
Jack, you're not falling asleep, are you?" i
Our next destination was the Alcazar. !
We had to po way underground to see Miss
Buckley, Miss Lee, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Doane
and- all. those folk. What a gentle, lamb
like' creature Miss Buckley is, and how
bubbling over with merriment Amy Lee
seems; she reminds one of ginger ale when
the cork pops.

BAIRD ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF WOMAN'S PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT
With the advent of the new woman has
come the absorbing question of female
athletics. To what extent can a woman
imitate a man in physical exercise? With
this thought in mind I have taken up the
â¢ pen to consider the subject in as popular
form as consistent with the clear under
standing of its merits.
It is.eutirely unnecessary for me to call
attention- to the fact that there is a vast
difference between the organization of
man and that of woman; I only mention
it to remind those who need reminding,
â¢ as it is a fact not generally known that
tqere is a goodly proportion of a com
munity bordering on ignorance that there
.-s any practical difference between man
and woman. They would be astonished if
.-â¢you were to accuse them of ignorance on
this subject. However, if you were to
press fbem closely about the matter they
would explain that the difference between
the sexes is like the difference between
two houses that they will point out to you
standing side by sideâ one somewhat
â¢ taller than the other, having a gable roof
'â¢in contrast to a flat roof and having a
porch over the door in contrast to none at
all. This is about all some people know
of the wonderiul difference between man
and woman.
Leaving details to the medical profes
sion and those who wish to consult with
physicians on this interesting subject, let
us consider the difference between the
'Bexes from an athletic point of view.
â¢ Observe two children of ten years of
age â a girl and a boy of the same size.
You will soon perceive that in matters of
.personal strength the boy is the stronger,
but in a race the girl will run faster for a
block or so. This demonstrates that the
frame of the male is by far the sturdier,
vriiereas the nerve force of the female pre
, dominates. To definitely understand just
what I mean the reader will havo to refer
to my letters of the latter part of July, as
1 cannot repeat two or three columns ia
' order to explain. In brief I there set
forth the principle that tne elements of
strength and speed were digestion, cir
culation, nerve iorce and muscular power.
Now, on the two first points the sexes
are about equally equipped; on the third
the female excels in some respects, but
on the last the male is decidedly . the
.â¢superior. If man is a creature of fiber
and force, woman is a mass of nerves and
overflowing with that element .in an elec
; trie state. â¢ V :"*'--'"r
â¢ Now, while it is true that the average
woman is liable to overtax her muscular
and vital strength by reason of excessive
dynamic force inherent in all of her sex;
â¢ Â£" d while it is true that men can under
*/r ke ith impunity feata of strength that
â¢ ifould be rash in a > woman, let it be re
m. bered that the physical constitution
or* i female can be developed to a degree
â¢â¢that is astonishing beyond measure. ' V

stock artists at the Alcazar are somewhat
dingy and suggest dampness, yet the occu
pants do not complain; they talk, sing,
laugh merrily and appear to enjoy life.
! Let us imagine they do. J must teil you
j about John T. Sullivan, the leading manâ
â  Rose Coghlan's husband, you know. His
dressing-room is the funniest. Ha! ha!
ha! You'd laugh heartily at the spectacle.
He has no luxuries, but many comforts,
and among them a gas stove. The chief
ornamentation is confusion â paints and
cosmetics are strewn about everywhere;
hats, numbering six at least, are some on
the floor, some on the wall and others just
ances were not feats of lifting, pushing or
pulling. It was the masterly handling of
her own body that attracted my attention,
and from that time on she was my ideal â
not only of womanly strength, but of
manly strength as well. The feats she per
formed were of the first order and included
the front horizontal from the trapeze,
which means that she hung from the
swinging bar with both hands, then, bend
ing only at the shoulders, drew her feet
up until her body was positively horizon
tal from her forehead to her ankles. I
have seen a few men do this, but never
could imitate it myself, though I spent
years in practice. The other feat was even
more marvelous. Her companion hung
from the trapeze by her knees and this
paragon among women clasped her bands
and hung therefrom. She proceeded to do
the horizontal just described, then, draw
ing up her knees proceeded to do the back
horizontal. Having accomplished this in
a manner similar to the front, her back
being uppermost, and with such ease that
perhaps not one person in ten realized the
magnitude of the lerforniance she pro
ceeded to do the flag.
Giving her body a slow twist she placed
herself in the position a person would as
sume if she were to lie on her right side in
Ded, her whole body being rigid. Let the

was by this position o! the right hand and
arm. that the actress was suspended from
the hand of her companion. I have at
tended many a circus and witnessed scores
of gymnastic performances since, but
neithtr by man or woman have I seen
this extraordinary feat equaled. I have
seen men attempt it and partially succeed,
but their performances lacked the finish
of my ideal.
Now, this incident proves that it is
possible for a womanâ some womenâ to
equal man in physical strength. Now, I
am not idiot enough to conclude that be
cause one member of the fair sex can
reach such perfection in muscular strength
it follows that the mnjority could do
likewise and rival man's boasted supe
riority; not at all. I mention it simply to
call attention to the possibilities of female
development. During a few weeks in
September and October I gave a biogra
phy of L. E. Myers, whom 1 consider the
greatest all-round runnettbat ever lived.
Now, because Myers could run 100 yards
in ten seconds, and 1000 yards in two min
utes and thirteen seconds, does not mean
that all men can do so, but it does reveal
the possibilities of the human constitu
tion.
Ever since the inspiration of that re
markable woman's acting I have believed
that the appalling weakness to be uni
versally found in what is most justly
known as the "weaker sex" is entirely
unnaturjl. I would not for a moment
give my indorsement to the almost brutal
custom among the peasantry of one of the

knows nothing of aches and pains, who is
a stranger to weaknesses and nervous pros

with coarseness of locks and manners.
You think it impossible lor a woman of
powerful muscles to be refined, or one
with broad chest and a circulation like a
small hydraulic pump to be cultivated â
in other words, to be a lady. Some people
have an intense admiration for what is
known as "the spirituelle," which means
that the poor creature has a pale, delicate

twenty-six dressing-rooms and a green
room, live on a level witn the stage and
the rest below. Every precaution has
been taken for the safety and health of ye

the best of plumbing. Order reigns
supreme. What fascination to watchmen
and women arranging wigs and disfigur

ing rooms. His room appears like every

not scrawny and as white as a sheet she
is considered a type of heavenly beauty.
It is difficult to know how to deal with
such insanity. They say Lord Byron lived
on crackers at one time in his life to im
prove the delicacy of his complexion, and
would sit with his hands held up by some
excuse that the blood might flow out of
the veins and leave the skin white. If 1
have slandered his lordship I will apolo
gize to his ghost the next time we meet.
What I have said is from hearsay, but I
look upon it as consistent with his life be
fore he assumed the role of a soldier.
In a ladies' paper I once read an edi
torial that represented that a certain
young lady, who was not very strong,
was recommended to taue up tennis. She
did so and became quite proficient, and it
was just here that the author of the arti
cle in question went into convulsions. Ie
was shown that after a time the young
lady came to lose the beautiful roundness
and symmetry of form and limb, and in
stead became muscular, angular and mas
culine. In describing this shocking state
of affairs the writer fairly sobbed with ex
citement.
For my pare I read the story with min
gled fee'ings of humor, scorn and indig
nation. The tone of the writing was that
of a fond mother going into hysterics
because her darling had burned hei finger;
but what made me indignant was that
nothing had been said in gratitude that
the girl had been transformed from sick
ness into health; but I regarded the
writer with scorn for exhibiting an ignor
ance that was inexcusable in a public
writer on such a subject. lam willing to
admit that perhaps the girl went too far
in her efforts to be a champion lady ten
nis player, but her friends should have re
membered that health is better than
beauty. I have heard a minister say that
a mother always cries at the marriage of
her daughter, and he explained it by say
ing that it was apprehensionâ that the
uncertainties of married life were such
that the mother trembled in fear that she
could not explain for the happiness of her
loved one.
Let us reflect a minute and guess: Could
it be that the mother is only too conscious
that tier daughter is anything but a well
woman; that though her cheek in flushed
it is more excitement tharv health; that
the symmetrical form, so beautifully set
off by the wedding dress, conceals vitals
that are positively weat; that the charm
ing manner and lively air and ready
smile, so attractive to the guests and par
ticularly to the groom, serve as a perfect
mask for nervousness and frailty. Is that
what the fond mother is weeping about?
Is it possible that there are two persons
in that brilliant gatheringâ the mother
and the family physicianâ who see in the
mists of the future the possibility of two
alternatives, an invalid's room or a di
vorce court. What of the young man who

So noble a man in office.
With principles high or degree.
He was born in IS'llei. Ohio,
In the year of forty-three.
He was educated In public schools
And the Portland Academy.
He studied and became a lawyer,
But, In his twenty- sixth year,
Like many others before him,
Resigntd for his country dear.
His reputation is military,
As well as political, too.
He authorized the "AlcKlney bill,"
A very great thin? to do.
As an orator he is a champion.
And in f:ivorof home rule ana gold,
While Bryan, for free trade and silver,
Was sadly left out ia the cold.
And now McKinley's our President,
And we're very nÂ«ppv to see
So wortny a man in oince
To govern th<s "land of the free."

A Dog's Own Story
Elba L. Upham.
To start with I must introduce myself.
I am not one of the kir.d to brag, but I
really am a beautiful, la me Newfoundland
dog with curly white and biack hair. I
have lived in this place ever since I was
a little, tiny puppy.
My young mistress is my dearest friend,
for she loves me better than any one else
does.
My mistress has two brothers, so of
course, I have two masters.
The elder one is too busy most of the
time to pay any attention to me, but the
younger one and I faavs many a merry
frolic together, and I love him dearly. I
am a good watchdog, so every on<i is kind
to me.
My name is Rrx. It was given to me
by my young mistress when I was a little
pupny.
I heard her say to her father: "Papa,
I'm going to call my dog 'Rex.' It is
short, musical and, best of all, it means
king."
I've since tried to be a king in deed as
well as name, but one night I sadly dis
graced myself.
This is how it happened. One day a big
dop, who lives here also, ate every speck of
my dinner. Of course, a fight followed,
during which I bit his ear and he bit my
mouth. I cried and howled until my
mistress Cnme out In her pretty dinner

she bathed my wounds with nice cool
water, and gave me a whole pan of fresh

milk. This was fine treatment, and made
me glad that I'd been hurt, but after
awhile when she put some nasty tasting
salve on my lips and told me not to lick it
off. I felt pretty sorry then.
Then I got scolded for fighting besides.
I had a very happy time when I was a
puppy. My mistress gays me a fine bath
every Saturday. But now I am heavier
than she is, and have to take my baths
in the river.
Now, I've spent a good deal of time in
telling you about myself, and I hope yoti
like me. I am very affectionate, and
would be very happy to have a good romp

Barbey Poles
When a man wants his whiskers
trimmed or a boy needs a hair-cut he
looks around for a place that has a red
and-white pole in front of it, and as soon
as he sees such a pole he knows he has
found a barber-shop. But why does a bar
ber always have this kind of a sign in
front of his shop?
In times cone by, before the world knew
as much about medicine as it does now,
everybody thought it was tht proper thing
to get rid of some of his blood now and
then, especially in spring time. This
was called blood-letting, and was done
by the barber?, who also pulled teeth, and
did several other things in those days be
s dcs culling hair. The operation of
blood-letting required the use of a small
pole or stick, which the patient held in
his band, and two bandagesâ one to wraj>
around the arm before the cut was made,
and the other to bind the wound after the
bieeding was over. Two bandages, ready
for use, were kept wrapped around a red
pole and displayed in the door or window
as a sign to the public After a time, in
stead of going to tne trouble of winding
strips of clotn about the pole, white stripes
were painted on the pole to represent the
bandages, and from that day until this
barbers nave always used that kind of a
sign. There are very few barbers to-day
who know why they use a red and white
pole, and some of them try to give it a
patriotic meaning by painting tneir signs
red, white and blue. This is all very
well, for a man has a right to do what he
likes with his sign, but it takes away
what little sense still remains in using a
blood-letting sign for a barber-shop. â St.
Nicholas.

Story for Tiny Folks.
Once upon a time there was a little boy
who did not like to have his face nor his
hands washed at all. One evening when
Bridget, his nurse, was trying hard to
make him nice and clean, and he was
kicking and (creaming and making a ter
rible racket, io and behold, all of a sud
den, he shot right out of Bridget's arms,
up, up throuph the ceiling!
This, of course, frightened the poor
nurse so much that she ran to his mother,
crying at the top of her voice.
The lady exclaimed in astonishment and
fear, "Come, come, let's search the house!
Ob, dear! Ob, dear! What shall we do
without Kenneth!"
"Wall, snure, mum, he went through
the ceilin', he did!"
"My friend," quoth the tailless gobolink,
"At you I don't mean to rail,
But you are quite a curious object
With that long thing called a tall."
"Don't say it," his brother responded,
'â¢For if such long thing* were for gale
You'd not think oi the curious object
But possess your own self of a tail."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1896.
"That doesn't matter, he may be in the
attic."
So they both climbed up the stairs,
Bridget wringing her bands and crying,
"Oh, mum, it was not me fault at all, at
all!"
Mrs. Nolan happened to think that it
was Halloween and tried to comfort the
nurse and herself by saying: "Youknow,
Bridget, goblins and fairies bold full sway
to-night, and I'm sure they have taken
him away for a little while to teach him a
lesson and will bring him back to us soon
all safe and sound."
Of course they didn't find him in the
attic, and I know my little readers are
anxious to learn what had really become
of him.
Well, after he bad been carried through
the ceiling and through the roof by strong
hands that he could not see, then over
trees and housetops, he was suddenly let
down into a very strange place. It was
just like a great big batbtub, and there he
had to stand in water (just think of it;
in his nightgown, too), while all around
him danced and grinned queer little black

beings, whom he knew to be goblins, for he
had often seen pictures of them. And,
worst of all, each one was armed with a
sponge, a piece of soap and a towel. Oh,
he was so frightened, so, of course, he
commenced to scream as loud as he could.
That was just what the goblins wished
him to do, for with an awful yell they
jumped at him and commenced to scrub
his face and hands with all their might.
How they did splash the water over
him! They seemed to enjoy getting soap
into bis mouth and eyes! And one ugly
little imp did nothing but dig and poke
at the poor little boy's pinic ears. He
cried and he cried and be cried! Then he
was so tired that ho stopped, and do you
know what happened then? Why the
very moment he shut his mouth the gob
lins stopped scrubbing him. You had
better believo he was glad? Then they
told him that if he'a promise to be a good
little boy, and never, never cry when bis
mamma or his nurse wished to wash bis
face, tuey would take him back home. Of
course he promised, and the funny gob
lins all disappeared, and he was lifted up
by the same bands that had brought him
there, was carried througii the air and
let down, oh, so gently, into his own dear
little white bed, where his mamma found
him fast asleep, when she came down cry-
Ing from the attic. I'm very glad to say
that Kenneth kept bis promise ever after

Heroism in Shipwreck
In the terrible story of the sinking of
the great British warship Victoria the
only gleam of brightness is the heroism
displayed by members of the doomed ves
sel's crew.
It is always inspiring to read how brave
men face death. The newspaper dis
patches tell us that the Victoria's
sailors maintained rigid discipline up to
the moment when their ship sank into the
deep Mediterranean. Even afte r they bad
been ordered to save themselves they per-
isted in their attempt to fix the "collision
mat" over the huge breach in the vessel's
s ide. Their commander set them a noble
example. When it became evident that
nothing could be done to save his ship lie
stood motionless and with folded arms at
his post on the bridge. A seaman ran up
with a lifebelt and offered it to him, but
the officer would not permit the sailor to
sacrifice his life, and told him to seek his
own safety.
Admiral Tryon's heroism recalls that of
Captain Craven of the Tecumseh in our
own civil war. The Tecumseh was one of
the monitors that took part in Farragut's
famous fight in Mobile Bay. As she en
tered the harbor where the enemy's fleet
was waiting to receive the attack there
was an explosion under her flank. She
had struck a submarine mine. The cap
tain was with the pilot when he felt the
shock. He knew what it meant. There
was little chance of escape from a monitor
floating almost submerged. He ran to the
narrow door of the pilot-house; so did the
pilot. There was not room for two to pass
through.
Captain Craven drew back. "After you
pilot," he said. It meant only the differ-
;nce of a moment, but it was the moment
jetween life and aeath. The pilot passed
hrough and was saved. The captain went
iown with his ship.

and is said to show in all cases the most
remarkable intelligence. She is fat and
sleek as a butter- fed baby, providing most
of her meals by "setting" and "point
ing"' sparrows when she is not engaged
in her duties as a sportsman's assistant,
although her master is so fond and proud
of her that be sees to it that, in the ab
sence of a meal of sparrows, she has all
that the most luxurious cat could want
for her daily meals. Nothing disturbs the
cat when once she has ferreted out the
whereabouts of a bird. Noises of all sorts
fail to attract her attention at such a
momenÂ«. .Rigid and crouching, she awaits
the crack of the gun before pouncing upon
her prey, and but for a slight nervous
twitching of her tail, no one would guess
that she was a living animal. The singu
lar part of it all is that she has never been
trained for this occupation. It seems to
have been born in her, just as poetry Is
born in poets. She can tell in an instant
whether or not her master's shot has been
true, and has never been known to chase
after a bird that was not wounded and
brought to the ground.
A GOLDEN AUTUMN.
An Autumn Song

Breathing it low where the leaves of the foreit

Whisperingever, "Fear not, though thy beauty
forsake thee!
Weary earth listen, and yield to my lullaby

Sweet shall thy dreams be; and surely, till

The hours shall be fleet!"
Hark to the autumn wind murmuring! tender

Chanting a solemn farewell to the year that si

The Children's Poet.
As we all know, Mr. Field was ever gen
tle and tender to the little ones. If they
were in any way weak or afflicted they ap
pealed all the more strongly to the love ot
which his heart was so full. His nature
was aB simple as a child's, and he loved
the children's toys as much as they did.
His sympathetic enjoyment of their pleas
are in any new toy was a revelation to tbe
every-day man or woman. One day I
went with him into a toystore to get some
little things for the babies, as he rarely
went home empty-handed. After he had
purchased several things he ordered a
dozen medium-sized bisque dolls. 1 won
dered what he was going to do with so
many, and put the question to him. He
answered: "Oh, I like to have them, and
when little girls come to see me I can give
them a dolly to take home." Sometime
after bis death the family found thebox
that bad contained the dolls. There was
only one left, and that one in some way
had been broken.
It was only a few weeks before his life
ended that he bought these dolls â so he
must have had many visits from his little
friends. â "Recollections of Eugene Field."

"What's that?"
"A man who makes books."

Dear Editor: This is my first letter to your
paper. I have a brother older than I, who
reads your paper with great interest and
wishes he were old enough to vote this elec

Republican meeting and had a nice display of
fireworks and the San Rafael band played.
The hall was crowded with people. I was very
fond of that story by the name of "Hayseed."

Came Aboard the Ship
When the sewina machine came aboard I
there was excitement fore and aft. It was
one of the small hand affairs capable of
' being locked up in a diddy box, but its
advent was looked upon with suspicion.
Paddy White, the old quartermaster on the
bridge, looked atthe thing longand steadily
through ins glass as it approached in
â  the launch, and concluding that it was
one of the gunner's new electric affairs for
torpedo tiring, did not report it to the
officer of the deck. W ite had been at see
so long that the shore had become terra
incognita to him, and the great world had
speeued on leaving him befogged, as it
were, inside the bulwarks of the ship. In
fact the word had been passed along that
Paddy had come to the frigate di:ectly
from the art, and his ''last discharge,"
which he exhibited upon enlistment, was
signed: Noah,
Captain commanding.
Albeit when Paddy White died in the
sick bay of sheer o!d age a strange solemn
looking bird was seen sitting on the end
of the flying boom, and the men said it
was the dead man's old shipmate, the
_ dove, come to take him away to the land
where olive branches grow in perennial
beauty.
So Ship's Tailor O'Keefe carried his pur
. chase over the gangway after the master-
at-arms had first examined the machine
to see if it was not loaded in some man
ner with an alcoholic mixture or other
. liquid explosive dangerous to the circula
tory systems of sailors. Saxie Fisher
. stood on the break of the to'galiant fore
castle, narrating to an interested audi
ence the story of his sister's only venture
into matrimony. Her husband w-is a
western ocean packet man that she had
run afoul of aiong the East River docks,
he said, and she had such a vicious tonuue
and temper that the poor fellow cleared |
out for sea before they had got home iroru
the church.
He was lost off the Horn and his ghost
hovered around her forever after, buzzing
its wedding experience in t tie ears of
everybody, which kept her from marrying
a,:aiu. According to Saxie's statement
she is a widow in Fiddler's Green now.
When Fisher saw the sewing machine
he knocked off his family history and
â¢ lifted up his voice in an observation calcu
lated to bring disrepute upon the tailor's
property. It had caused idleness, extrava
gance and tue love of Jress to the females
of his race and the same disastrous effect
would soon be noticed aruonq the crew.
They would get too nice in their personal
tastes ior good, plain, ready-made pay
master's clothing and the ship would be
crowded with the clattering affairs. As
for him, no tie-ties, gil-gies or gingerbread
work would adorn his uniform.

itâ and swore huge deep-sea oaths that he
AND NOW THE DEAF MAY HEAR
It Is possible to Listen to Music JKrougK
tKe /^ger\cy of the Har\ds.
By means of an invention of Dr. Thomas
McKendrick, a noted expert in electro-
therapeutics of Glasgow, Scotland, it is
â¢ po sible for the deaf to hear music. To
accomplish it the deaf person must dip
his hands into a tub of water. A phono
graph is used for supplvinsr the music.
The sound waves are directed into a regu
lar telephone transmitter. The transmit
ter connects with a series of batteries un
der the tub, connecting therewith. The
harmony is carried to the brain through
the hands.
TO ENABLE THE DEAF TO HEAR.
The principle on which Dr. Kendrick
based his idea is one wh eh is but little
understood. Water is one of the be>t con
ductors of electricity known. According
to the New York Herald, Dr. William
Harvey Kingo: New York, a well-known
electro - tberaÂ»>eu)ical expert, who baa
studied Dr. McKendrick's discovery, said
a few days a-o that the great d ffioulty
which had always baffled experimenters
in this line was that the batteries used
did not produce the perfect rhythmical
vibrations necessary.
"We have made this experiment with
the Faradic battery," said Dr. King, ''but,
to speak technically ior a moment, the
long period of cessation between the
'make' and the 'breaK destroys the
rhythm and consequently the sensation
is not transmitted. The European expert
has prepared a special battery, the secret
of which no still retains."
The process by which the rhythm of
niUBic is transferred through the nerves
t" tlie nerve center of the brain is dearly
described by Dr. King.
"If you have ever been aboard a small
s-teaai vessel which was being propelled at
high rate of speed by machinery of high
ijoreepower." said Dr. King, "you have,
no doubt, felt the unbroken or rhythmical
vibrations going through the body of the
craft. Now. a deaf person, under the con- |
dition cited, hears these v.braiions as well
as one whose auditory nerves are perfectly

Then he went forward under the fore

who enjoyed the noni de guerre of "Chief
Growler of the Navy." Farrel. as usual,
was in a warm condition of mind, as he
had just caught a tanv rope yarn blowing
across his clean white deck.
Donovan somewhat loudly began to
speak to him of his latest worry, and the
chief growler, happy to find an object on
whom to vent his bottled-up wrath, turned
on the signal quar ermaster likf a wild
cat. He wante 1 to know why Donovan
rushed at him about the machine. Didn't
he have troubles enough of his own ? Did
he bring the blamed thing aboard? Did
people think he, the captain of the fore
top starboard watch, was going to run a
hand-me-down shop anl be a man milli
ner for every hay-making recruit that
wanted dude stitching on his mustering
clothes?
Donovan, more angry, retorted to the
effect that the foretop man wai not too
Â«ood for such an occupation, and, come to
think ol it, he was probably v silent
partner in the proposed tailoring estab
lishment. They carried tue truculent dis
cussion back through ail the "last" ships
they bad sailed together raising their
voices high and higher in profanity and
recrimination until the officer of the deck
bore down upon them and ordered the de
baters to the mast. When the childish
casus belli ot the contention was made
known to the commander the two were
severely reprimanded and their shore
leave stopped for a month.
In the meanwhile the word went on
down the ship till it reached John fitch,
the captain of the afterguard, who was
| fiercely nerding four sheep belonging to
the officers' mesa off the quarterdeck.
John was not a shepherd in the biblical
sense of the term, but the flock evidently
knew his voice and loved him despite his
frequently expressed bitter hatred for
them and they demonstrated their faith
and affection by making, uninvited, a fold
o: his part of the ship. Occasionally they
would dine off his laundry spread out on
t:.e coil of a buatfall to dry and it was no
uncommon thing for Fitch to fi;id a sheep

normal. While the sensation of listening
to the music is accomplished on the same
general principle as I have just described
the effect on the deaf would be much
more striking and agreeable.
"Take, for instance, a person who has
been deaf from birtu. He immerses his
hands in the prepared water connected
with the phonograph. The rhythm of the
music is conducted by the nerves locally
affected to the fi-sure Rolando in the
brain, and the sensation is one of pleas
ure. Greater still is the pleasure experi-
enced by one who ha? at one time had
normal bearing ana who has become deaf
from some cause or another. If the tune
selected is one with which the subject has
been familiar he may easily folow the
varying changes of the music, and by the
aid of his imagination, which in the deaf
is unusually acute, be can thus enjoy the
oddly conducted concert almost as thor
oughly as if his hearing was normal."
\\ nile the new system of making the
deaf hear is yet in its infancy Dr. King
says that scientists all over the world,
himself included, are working untiringly
with the electrical agent, and are sanguine
of even great r success than has already
been attained.

Weird Story of the Haunted Hull of the
Wrecked Blairmore
The tragic experiences of the British
ship Blairmore, which arrived in port on
the 2d of last February, are too recent to
require recapitulation. While in ballast
she was capsized in a sudden gale und
sank to the bottom with six of her unfor
tunate crew in the hold. She was raised
with immense difficulty and was at last
floated. Subsequently the luckless vessel
was towed to the docks of the Pacific Jtioll
ing Mills, where she now lies.
Uncanny stories are floating around
about the B airmore and the belief that
she is a haunted ship has grown until all
the workmen at the mills are convinced
that something supernatural is occurring
nightly in the once submerged hull. In no
other way can the scenes and incidents
which, it is claimed, do occur be explained.
The seaman, by inheritance and tradi
tion, is a superstitious individual, and If
the marvelous tales related of the Blair
more originated from that source they
might be dismissed with incredulous dis
dain; but in this case no seaman is re
sponsible for their origin but the alert,
vigilant and practical mgnt watchman of
the rolling-mills, who admits that strange
things have happened upon the Blair
more, but declines to enter into particu
lars. From an intimate of the watchman
and one who has himself been a witness
of the unexplainable phenomenon, the
narrative was obtained. It was not until
the Blairmore had been at the rolling
mill dock for over a week that anything
extraordinary was observed. The watch
man used to visit the ship on his rounds,
and one night detected a peculiar sound as
of falling rock somewhere near.
It did not occur to him at the time that
the sounds could have proceeaed from the
Blairmore and it was no: until he had
been thus disturbed for several nights that
he concluded to investigate, presuming
that some adventurous boy pirate was
pect to nee him -the speakerâ out on the
yardarra clawing on a reef earring and his
shirt flying away in blue patches to
"lu'ard" on tne bosom of the storm in
stead of staying on his own back where it
should be. The spectacle of Judge Clark's
beamy hull bared to the stings and whips

would have added his voice to the official

gull looking mockingly at him as it
winded past, and he was in too much of a
ra-e at the manifest insolence of the bird
to further burden his mind.
So the old men ol the navy laboriously
sewed their garments, their stiff, tarry
fingers threading the big "homeward
bound" white stitches wiggling ovor the
blue cloth. As they sat on their diddy
boxes and held their sewing net ween their
tottery knees they scowled like a Cape
Horn sky at the neat iittle steel seamstress
as it stitched, stitched away fashioning
the natty vacation togs of the new navy.

committing depre iations. He climbed on
deck and stood over the hatchways listen
ing to the sounds ihat came up from the
hull, which resembled those made by the
falling of ballast on an iron keel. The
watchman Jet down his lantern into the
hold and all sounds were instantly hushed.
D ferring a closer examination until day
liuht he then found nothing below to indi
cate the presence of any person whatso
ever. Considerably puzzled, he gave up
the investigation, but on his rounds the
next night he aga.n heard precisely the
same sounds. The-e continued with occa
sional intervals of silence all night and
for several nights, when the watchman
imparted his discovery to several of his
friends, who, impelled by curiosity, shared
his vigils and were rewarded by a succes
sion of noives that rilled them with awe
and fear. All were completely at sea re
garding the mysterious origin of the dis
turbances. Reports rproad about the mills
that there were ghosts on tne Blairmore
and there are but few of the men now who
have not heard these strange sounds tnal
nightly proceed from the deserted i ull.
A Mr. Atwater, who lives at 532 Illinois
street, and who is not only a believer in
spiritualism but also claims to be a well
developed medium, asserts that the Blair
more is haunted by the spirits of the lost
seamen, and claims that in a visit which
he made alone at night to the ship his
neck was encircled by ghostly arms and
his hands clasped by invisible spirits.
Mr. Atwater asserts also that he commu
nicated with these and received from one
of them a message to his home in Scot
land relating to a matter important to his
family. Thp message was sent, according
to Mr. Atwater, and a reply received by
him in which it was stated that an event
of great importance to the family had
been settled by its means.

THE BLAIRMORE'S HAUNTED HULL.
Laudable Plan for the Encouragement of
Young Artists
Among the expedients which patrons of
art have found to be fraught with the
1 most satisfactory results in diffusing a
taste for art, while assisting and encour
aging artists, the "union" plan has been
generally accepted in Europe in prefer
ence to other systems. In the older East
ern cities it has also been introduced, with
the result that high-class raftings find
their way into many humble homes, there
to be a beacon, as it were, to guide and
elevate the taste of the household. For
many years the "art union" plan has
been an institution in England, France
and Germany, and as such has attracted
widespread nttention, which of itself long
ago developed a nice feeling for art, where
otherwise people might suli be satisfied
with chromos or "potboilers"â anything
that has the character of pictures, so lon
as it was within the reach of their purses.
Here in Han Francisco but litttls is
known of this popular sys;em of serving
two purposes at ihe same time â patroniz
ing deserving artists and distriouting
more continue. The ghostly ballasting
still tzoes on night after night anl its
origin is as mysterious .as ever. To quiet
thp nervous apprehension of the work
men of the mills the ship will shortly be
removed to another and more solitary
berth.

The Mexican Congress has recently
amended it laws, relating to patents.
The proprietor of a patent or invention or
improvement is obliged to prove to the
Minister of Commerce and Industry at
the end of every five years while the
patent lasts ami in order to keep it in
force for further five years, that he has
paid to the treasury at the termination of
the first five year 3 the sum of $;>0 as an ad

sum of $100. AM these payments must be
made in Mexican dollars. The time dur
ing which it must be proved that these
payments have been made is limited to
two months after expiration of the period
of five years, and such time shall not
be extended. Those persons interested,
who up to the date of promulgation
of this law may have to become subject to

their paintings among the people. The
art uaion plan is lashioned after the lines
of lotteries, but drawings of prizes under
it are not spoken of as lotteries. They
are given the better sounding name of
"art drawings."
In some cities of Europe, after exhibi
tions of pictures, tne works of several
artists are collected and disposed of by
tiiese art drawings. As a rule there is no
trouble in getting rid of tickets for the
drawings, for the patrons of art, and, in
deed, men and women of fine tastes, con
tribute liberally. They feel perfectly SRt
islied if they are fortunate enough to get
a picture once in years, and even if luck
does not favor them so far they con
tent themselves with the conviction that
they are doing their share toward main
taining the steady development of culture
and refinement in their community.
So art and artists receive encouragement
which helps them on their way, with re.
suits that are very apparent in the coun
tries where such patronage flourishes. In a
new art community support of this nature
cannot /ail to have a decidedly beneficial
effect, more especially where it is made
popular.
In this City the art-drawing scheme has
been introduced as a permanent feature of
exhibitions of the Art Association. Only
the more favored few, however, those pos
sessed of money, who can affod $5 for a
single subscription to the drawing, can
participate. And yet it has been a flatter
ing success from all points of view. The
artists are delighted with it, since by this
medium they dispose of paintings which
would lie in their studios awaiting pur
chasers, and members of the Art Associa
tion are pleased, because they know that
their institution ha3 added to its useful
ness through the medium of the art
drawing.
But tiie artists have still further reasons
for mutual congratulations. They are,
indeed, elated over a movement started
in their behalf by the Mechanics' Insti
tute, which, at this early stage, promises
to aid materially in developing a patron
age of local artists that may give new life
to art in California. The Mechanics' In
stitute has organized an art drawing, and
as the directors say they will push it for
ward with the same spirit of public enter
prise which has characterized every un
dertaking of the institute, the artists look
forward to a yearly art drawing that will
be talked about in every town in the State.
This institution is organized under the
title of the Association of Cal.fornia Art
Patrons, witu a constitution and by-laws
as follows:
article r.
This association shall be called the Associa
tion of California Art Patrons.
ARTICLE 11.
Section 1. The object of this association
shall be to provide for a iund for the purchase
of works of art by California artists exhibited
in the art gallery of the Mechanics- Institute
at Uk annual fairs. The works purchased to
be distributed among the members of this
association at each and every annual exhibi

Sec. 2. The minimum subscription shall be
50 cents.

their opportunities for securing the works
purchased Ly the payment oi additional sub
scriptions to the fund.

BIERSTADT'S MOVABLE FORT
JKe Famous Pair\ter JMakes His/lppearance
ir\ the Pole of a Military IrvVerxtor.
Albert Bierstadt, the famous painter,
whose invention of the theater-car cre
ated such wide interest, has now con
ceived and patented a novel folding car,
which can be utilized as a traveling fort
for soldiers. It is considered eminently
BIERSTADT'S MOVABLE FORT.
practicable, Bays the New York Herald.
It is a two-story affair. Downstairs are
the livinp-room and the barracks for the
soldiers. Upstairs are the officers' quar
ters, while out on what might almost be
called a .balcony a field piece can be
mounted or a sentry take his stand. Of
course, all these things are not in working
order while the railroad fort is movine
from place to place. The car is unlolded
at its destination.
All the walls, and the roof, in which are
skylights, can be folded up in such a man
ner that in its most compact form the car
wi 11 occupy no more ioom than that of an
ordinary freightcar. The mechanism by
means of which it is folded is located at
the ends. It is operated by a system of
screws and cranks, which can be handled
by very few men.
Mr. Bierstadt has made two designs for
this car. In one, as stated, the second
story is used for officers' quarters. In the
other the upper story is a sort of observa
tion lower. At the same time it can also
serve almost the same purpose as the
turret to a ship. Gnns can be placed
most advantageously, ana so solid is the
material of which the car is constructed
that it will endu.e a recoil of considerable
force.
Again, there is ample space for posting
a large number of sharpshooters in the
second story.
Oi course this car, when constructed of

sociation, two artists, and one member of the
Board of Trustees of the Mechanics' Institute.
Sec. 3. "This committee shall select before
the close of the exhibition each year, accord
ing to the funds provided, the works to be dis
tributed.
ARTICLE TV.
The works selected shall be distributed im
mediately after the close of the exhibition
from which they are purchased, in the pres
ence of members of the Board of Trustees of
the Mechanics' Institute and of the selecting
committee. Four trustees and three mem
bers of the committee of selection shall con
stitute a quorum.
article v.
All funds collected at each exhibition shall
be applied to the purchase of works at that
particular exhibition.
Though started near the close of the re
cent exhibition, yet practically nothing
was done in carrying the plan into execu
tion. The plan was given no publicity.
The directors of the institute have not
been idle, however, since the exhibition
closed its doors, and consequently their
association has taken firm root. Several
favorite pictures that were exhibited at
the fair by local artists have been chosen,
and are now at the institute library build
ing on Post street. Meanwhile the artists
interested, attaches of the Mechanics' In
stitute, and others are selling subscrip
tions to the association about town. Just
as soon as the desired amount is received â
about $1000 will be the limit for this first
yearâ there will be an art drawing at the
library.
Through this means people will have an
opportunity of securing a really good pic
ture for an investment of 50 cents. In
which particular the scope of ths Associa
tion of California Art Patrons differs from
the Art Association's drawing. One is
for all alike, the other for the rich.
Henry Rasch. n, the artist, who is chief
of the art exhibition in the fair, is among ,
the most enthusiastic supporters of the
association. "It is on the plan of art
drawinss, which prominent art societies
in the East and in Europe have developed
into wonderful proportions," he said yes
terday. '"The directors of the institute
have started it off handsomely, and sev
eral artists are working hard for its suc
cess. So far we have not decided when
the art drawing wiil take place, but it is
tbe intention to keep it going until enough
money is in the treasury to warrant a dis
tribution of the paintings. For instance,
when $1000 is subscribed the committee of
selection will choose good pictures for
that value and distribute them among
members.
â¢'As the directors have thus shown a
desire to assist the local artists we in turn
are willing to meet them half way.
"That is, we let the pictures go ior much
less ti;an the real value. It must be
understood that this is only the begin
ning of a permanent art institution of
San Francisco, and, when properly under
stood by people who appreciate art, it will
surely grow to be an immense thing. la
a new art community thi3 is a highly com
mendable effort and should receive liberal
encouragement.
"People may become members by sub
scribing at the Mechanics' Institute Li
brary on Post street, or with artists who
are interested. In due time the result ot
the drawing will be announced."
Wooden vs. Iron Ships.
Mathematical calculations show that an
iron ship weighs 27 per cent less than a
wooden one, and will carry 115 tons of
cargo for every 100 tons carried by a
wooden ship of the same dimensions and
both loaded to the same draught of water.
wood, is by no means bullet proof, but the
inventor believes that sheet iron or some
material of equal resisting force can be
u>ed, thus rendering it a real fortress,
which could be moved from place to place
with great ease.
Aininiature car of this sort can be seen
by the curious ar the Patent Office in
Washington. It seems, of course, an im
practicable idea, yet the officers of the
United Spates army who have inspected
the model and listened to Mr. Bierstadt
tell of it have expressed their entire faith
if) the practicability of the idea.
It was often said during the rebellion
that if some arrangement could have been
placed on the railroad, so constructed as
to contain thirty or forty men comfortably
and at the same time so fitted as to enable
the garrison to use a small' piece of artil
lery and other ri-earrns, whole sections of
the country could have been held by the
Union forces that, under conditions ttien
existing, had to be surrendered. Now this
is just the thing. It can readily be seen
that the car when unfolded contains suffi
cient room to give the wounded a piace
where they tan be undisturbed.
â¢ The bunks are similar to those in the
forecastle of an old-time merchantman.
But there is plenty of breathing room ana
windows enough to insure the requisite
amount of fresh air. The windows, of
which there are many, do not look as if
they would afford much protection, but
it is intended that iron shutters, perfo
rated with loop holes, shall be placed over
each opening. There is a place for an
eiy;ht-pound gun on each side of the car,
and it will be possible to use rapid-lire

THE STAGE
"All the world's a stase," and last week
the drama was not enncted in the theater?,
but in the polling booths and round the
ballot box. There was an odd contrast,
on election night, between the half-empty
theaters, wi:h the actors reciting their
familiar lines, and the rush and excite
ment in the crowded streets outside. For
once, the plays seemed stereotyped, and
the actors' efforts mechanical and unieal.
I suppose it could scarcely have been
otherwise. Inside the theaters, the play
ers' paint was hud on with studied art,
their mimic joys and passions were
excellently well feigned, but outside the
excitement was real; the nation's puLse
was at fever heat, and, contrasted with the
men and women cheering the election
returns, the actors seemed "merely
players."
â  But the fever heat is all over now. The
performance advertised by .the Advance
Agent of Prosperity has come to stay, the
audience has taken its piace, the curtain
is about to ring up and theatrical man
agers nre chortling in their glee, for peo
ple are to have
Their pockets full of money
And their hearts full of cheer.
(I dare not predict the original, which is:
"Their cellars full of beer.") People are
to have work and money, anyway, and
they will then be in a position to patronize
the drama right royally.
Loie Fuller is going to sail away after
her engagement here to dance before the
Viceroy nnd the most exclusive circles in
Chinese official life. Over there she will
not appear in theaters open to the vulgar
Chinese herd âon the contrary, 6he does
not expect to dance in anything so com
mon as a theater. La Loie will pass her
time "mid pleasures and palaces" of offi
cial life in the Flowery Kingdom, and her
dances will be executed in marble halls
before select circles of prinoes and man
darins. In Paris they idolized Miss Fui
ler, though the Parisians drew the line at
building temples and erecting statues in
her honor. At home she has been re
ceived kindly, but the commandment for
bidding idolatry has never been in the
least jeopardized by her presence. La
Loie may have her revenge for this cold
ness when sl.e reaches China, for rumor
says the wily Viceroy whispered in her
ear that in all probability she woula dance
herself into the ranks of the Celestial im-
mortals and get her image into all the
josshouses. If this be true what an alto
gether novel and fetching advertisement
it will make for La Loie's press agent to
write her up as a deified mortal, and tell
how punic is burning in her honor on a
thousand altars.
Where is San Francisco? This is not a
conundrum. It is a bona fide question,
asKed in good faith and inspired by con
temporary musical news in Eastern
papers. If we accept as gospel what these
esteemed contemporaries say, San Fran
cisco mun certainly have been blotted out
of the map of the United States. Not one
shock, but a series of shocks has brought
me to this conviction. What we do is ig
nored, what we don't do is told in large
type; in fact it is plainly evident that
when Mr. Ananias and Miss Sapphira are
short of "copy" to eke out tneir musical
news, they let themselves loose on this de
voted City and its musicians, and the re-
Bolt would justify anyone in asking:
Where is San Francisco?
I read the other day, with a good deal
of interest, in the New York papers, how
Mrce, Belinfante, the blind contralto, ha I
just sung "for the first time in America"
at Chickering Hall. All the papers em
phasued "for the lirst time in America."
Ii it possible that when she warbled here
six months ago La Belinfante imagined
herself to be in a detached suburb of
Hongkong or in an outpost of the Mi
kado's dominions? Another piece of
news which has deeply interested me is
the high praise which the San Francisco
japers (accord ng to their Eastern con
temporaries) are lavishing upon Mrs.
Celia Fisher. It seems that Mrs. Fisher
has created quite a furor here. Far be it
from me to say that she has not done so.
I only deplore never having heard of the
lady, and hope for the future (if she is not
an invention of the Ananias reporter)
that she will cease hiding her light be
nea'.h a bushel. Good singers are rare,
and when found should be made a note of.
But the dastardly work of the Ananias
reporter was done when he ruthlessly
drowned our gifted Mrs. Marquardt. The
Musical Courier gave her a beautiful
obituary notice last month, but that was
sorry consolation for her death. It seems
that John Marquardt wastheonly passen
ger saved from the wreck of the Druni
roond Castle off the coast of France last
June, and that his wife perished. The
Courier is five month* lato in get
ting its news, but it compensates for
that by giving hariowing detail".
The distinguished violinist was on a pro
fessional tour round the world, accom
panied by his wife, Mme. Aleiandriua
Ureitschuck Marquardt, a harpist of great
eminence. There was a concert on board
one night and v.-hile the strains of the
music were still resounding the vessel
went on thu rock?. The shock was a slight
one and no one suspected that the Drum
mond Castle was in serious danger till
she began to sink. As the steamer was
coingdown Herr Marquardt seized hold
of a rail and sat asiride of it all night. At
first there were three other persona sitting
on the rail with him â the fourth officer
ana a male and a femaie passenger. During
the night, however, the others fell off and
were drowned, Herr Maiquardt being the
sole survivor. He was ultimately saved
by a fisherman, having been in the water
twelve hours.
According to the Musical Courier this
news was not "made in America." It was
imported, doubtless at great expense, from
Australia. So little does the Musical
Courier know about San Francisco that it
published the tale of woe in bland uncon
sciousness that Mrs. Marquardt ha 3 been
appearing at largely attended semi-weekiy
concerts in San FrarjCisco for several
months. I hope that tlie protection Mc-
Kinley is soon to bestow upon us will in
clude a tariff upon the efflorescences of the
Ananias reporter's brain.

In his recently published "Musical
Reminiscences" Arditi tells a number of
good stories of musical celebrities, some of
them old, some published for the first
time. Of Christine Nilsson, he says that
when she wa< studying with him she was
so nervous that s>he frequently tore the
lace on her dress. Arditi knew many fa
mous composers, among them Rossini,
who when lime. Arditi was introduced to
him exclaimed gallantly: "Now I know
why Arditi composed 'The Kiss.' ' ' Once
when Arditi conducted Her Majesty's
Opera in St. Louis a man walked twenty
miles "to hear Queen Victoria sing in Her
Majesty's troupe. "
The St. Louis papers are circulating the
statement that. Lillian Russell is again

; den es the statement, and declares that
she is firmly wedded to her art.
It seems that Miss Russell remained in
St. Louis to tÂ«ke a much-needed rest, and
there she happened to meet Walter Jones
of the "Gay New York Company," who is
her declared admirer. The two were seen
a good deal together, and the report went
forth that they were engaged, but the par
ties most interested strenuously deny the
soft impeachment.
Miss Selma Herman, the clever young
actress who plays the character of Ilda,
the daughter of an exile, in "Darkest
RuÂ£s:a," had a thrilling experience with a
trolley-car while in Denver last week. As
she was crossing Sixteenth street, on her
way to the theater, she became confused
by the bustle and clanging oi gongs around
her and was struck by a car. The prompt
action of ihe motorman saved her. At the
risk of his life he leaned over the dash
board nnd caught her as she fell and
pulled her from under the wheels. The
young woman luckily escaped with only a
torn and soiled gown. Miss Herman
showed her gratitude by a liberal purse and
later presented the hero with a diamond
scarfpin.

The main features of H. Grattan Don

system of the Russian empire, and show
the laws under which the people are bur
dened, and the power vested in the offi
cial?. The opening act shows the throne
| room of the Czar's palace at St. Peters
burg, and emphasizes the wealth and
splendor of the aristocracy, while the sec
ond and third acts deal with the Nihilists
and the police system. The las: act takes
place in Siberia. The characters are jaiil
to be strongly drawn, and Septimus Cobb,
the American colonel from Kentucky, and
the German Baroness are the funniakers
who prevent the drama lrom becoming
too lugubrious. Picturesque mounting is
promised.

KEW YORK, K. TV, Nov. 7.â Securities were
active and buoyant during to-day's short session
at the Stock Exchange. In fact, the trading was
more animated than on any other Saturday since
December last, when the street was alarmed over
the Venezuelan, war scare. ThÂ» demand, for
stocks was more general, and both the gilt-edge'
shares and the low-priced fancies were taken 'with'
confidence. The rise since Tuesday last naiuraliy
enoiu-n invited profit taking, but the stock of
fered found a ready market. Commission bouses
had more to do, indicating a revival of outside
Interest; anil 1 oca operators who have been in
clined to question the legitimacy of the upward
movement, and who from time to time during the
past few days have put out short lines, cov
ered up.
The special Influences at work were ! the re
sumption of business throughout the country, a
belief that money will rule easier now that confi
dence ha* been restored and an impression that
some of the granger roads will tn:rea-Â»e their divi
dends in the near future. The bank statement
bad no effect on speculation, notwithstanding a
loss in reserve and a heavy contraction in loins.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO. Its,. Nov. 7.-The week closed with
a nervous feeling in the wheat market and with
prices fluctuating around- the best point reached
since election day. Trade seen but one side of
the market, but with professionals, scalpers and
outsiders all "long" am! with practically no short
Interest existing the question of marketing wheat
receives consideration. At the end of the first
hour the demand received s imulus from Brad
street's report, which stated that the exportable
surp'us of this country for the cereal year Is only
22,000,000 bushels. A sharp jump from 78c to
79% c for December followed tne circulation of
this report. The pit became a.l confusion and
the trading was heÂ«ivy and broad.
The shipments from both coasts for the week
were 3,472,000 bushels, against 3.6^8,000 bu.hels
for la^L week. Keceio:s In tbe Northwest were
775 cars, against 936 las: Saturday and 1191 a
rear .190. Chicago had 122 oars and inspected
but 723 bushels. Argentine shipped I*o,ooo
bushels last week. The New York bunk Mac
men! was a. poor one, and when the details were
learned me sel.ing movement was inaugurated in
wheat, the. reaction in prices whicti took place
being quite as sharp as Â«us tie advance. > xporti

of wliea: had a strengthening effect on corn, tut
the action of the market whs about the^ame at

and the undertone was not buoyant. Liverpool

TO RAISE THE
PRICE OF BREAD
Master Bakers' Association
Determines Upon an
Unpopular Move.
Will Not Permit Dealers to Sell
a Loaf for Less Than
Five Cents.
COMMISSIONS BEDTJCED ALSO.
The Custom of Permitting the Return
of Unsold Loaves to Discontinue
Under the Same Order.
The master bakers of the City are mak
ing an effort to raise the price of bread,
basing it upon the recent rise in the price
of flour.
Those having the movement in charge,
however, claim that to raise the price of
bread is not as easily done as to plan it.
If the protest being raised by their cu"
-tomerÃ, the "branch stores" and grocers
counts for anything they are quite right
about it.
A general meeting of the master bakers
of the City was held on Thursday, under
the auspices of the Master Bakers' Protec
tive Association of San Francisco and
Alameda counties, at which resolutions
were adopted declaring that no bread be
cold for less than 5 cents per loaf; that
the weight of a 5-cent loaf should not be
more than 18 ounces when baked and that
no baker shall sell bread to any dealer
who shall sell it at less than this price.
The resolution also provides that no
bread shall be returned to the dealers and
th<tt the commission to dealers shall be
limited to 25 per cent.
This means a very material increase in
the price of bread to dealers and to the
consumer alike. Two loaves of bread may
be purchased from many of the- dealers
and bakers for five cents, and dealers are
protesting loudly. As yet the increased
price has not in any instance gone into
eff ct nnd the public therefore has not
been heard from.
Nicholas Prost 2S president of the Master
Bakers' Protective Association. Speaking
of the matter yesterday afternoon he said :
"The price of bread is too low in view of
the hieh price of flour. Besides there is
such competition among the bakers that
they are cutting each other's throats and
bringing ruin to many of them. A grea:
many bakers failed this year, and a good
many more will do so unless the trade is
regulated in some way. For instance,
many bakers in their eagerness for trade
give overweight bread, as much as twenty
two ounces to a 5-cent loaf, nnd then give |
50 per cent commissions to the dealers.
"This, together with the custon of tak- |
ing back the bread from the dealer that is j
unsold, leaves very little profit to the j
baker. Many of t lie dealers take a great i
deal mere bread than they sell just to I
make an appeurance in their window. If i
we tell them they cannot have so much,
they reply by saying they will find a
baker who will let them have what th6y
want. We have to bring the stale bread
back to the shop and sell it at a reduced
price and to our Joss. Many of the dealers
Bell at a less price than 5 cents a loaf, and
so we have fixed the price at 5 cents and
dealers are not allowed to eel! under that
price. Off that price they can do well
enough at 25 per cent commission.
'â¢However," continued President Prost,
"I am not certain that the thing may be
made to work. There are only ninety
members in the association, while there
are about 190 bakers in the City. Unless
they all signed the agreement and abided '
by it we could not enforce it upon any.
There has been an awlul fuss made already
about the proposed increase in price and
reduction in commissions. The dealers
char.-c us with being another monopoly,
another Southern Pacific corporation,
wanting all the profits and denying to
others the right to live. So lam not sure
we will be able to make it go."
Frank Siebrecht of Engelhardt's bakery
on Kearny street, who does a big
"wagon" business, said yesterday that he
bad left the association on account of this
action. He said he did not propose to be
governed by it; that he regulated the
price and the size of his loaves according
to the price of flour and would not submit
to the dictation of the association.
Following are the resolutions as passed:
Whereas, The bakery business at the present
time is in a very unsatisfactory condition ;
ana whereas, the modern r-.-quirements of all
bakers are to-day very much enlarged and not
at all in conformity with the price of the
manufactured article; nnd whereas, the price
of flour has advanced 35 per cent and is likely
to go still higher by reason of the advance of
wheat, be it
Jietolved, That the price and weight of bread
be uniform throughout thn City; that the
practice of taking back stale bread be abol
ished; that all Roods ordered and delivered
â¢hall be charged and collected as per schedule
price, to be fixed as above stated; that unaer
no circumstauces 1 any manufactured article
be taken back or exchanged; that no bread be
sold for less than 5 cents per loaf at retail;
that we allow all branches, grocers, restau
rants, hotels and all dealers in breadstufls 25
per cent on all sales, provided their oblign
tions are met promptly; that the weight oi a
5-cent loaf of bread should not be more than
eighteen ounces when baked and thih shall be
the standard ; the pricejof loaves of larger size
shall be in proportion to their weight as com
pared with the weight of a 5-cent loaf; that no
baker shall sell bread to any dealer who shall
sell it at less than the price established by the
association as the retail price.
That it is the sense of this meeting that the
Master Bakers' Association be urged to get
every baker of this City to sign the above reso
lution.
The above provision shall go into effect and
be binding upo:i the assent of the majority of
the master bakers of San Francisco, given
under their signatures hereto aud ratified by a
general meeting of the master bakers of San
Francisco to be held hereafter. We, the under
signed, master bakers of the City and County
of San Francisco, hereby agree to <*arry out
the provisions contained in the foregoing reso
lutions of the Master Bakers' meeting, and we
do lurther agree that in case it Rhouid be de
eded upon to be expedient, we shah enter Into
a bond or g:ve other sans'nctory securities for
the faithful performance by us of the condi
tions of tire loregoing resolutions.

ACCIDENT AND SUICIDE.
Albert 11. Capeile Shot Himselfâ Daniel
â¢ loluiMoii'g Overdose.
Coroner Hawkins held an inquest yes
terday over the body of Albert H. Capelle,
who committed suicide by shooting him-
Belf through the head at the Cliff House,
on October 28. A verdict of suicide was
returntd by the jury.
Only two witnesses were examined, C. E.
Bendixen, who was with the suicide on
the fatal evening, and Robert Capelle,
brother of the deceased. Bendixen de
scribed how he went to the Cliff House
with the deceased. Capelle was well, he
said, but acted queprly and passed strange
remarks. Kobert Capelle swore that his
brother had been sick for a long time, and
that he took his own life while temporarily
insane.
In the case of Daniel Johnson, a verdict
of accident was returned. It was de
veloped at the inquest that the deceased
had been suffering from lung trouble for
some time, and without the knowledge of
his family had been using morphine. On
the evening qf October 29 he took an over
dose of this poison, from the effects of
which he died the following day.

PORTLAND RATES
TO BE ADVANCED
Harmony Between the War
ring Carriers to Be
Restored.
One of the Objects of President
McNeill's Visit to This
City.
ALL LINES NOW HEAVY LOSERS
A Rate War That Has Been Main
tained for More Than Three
Years.
E. McNeil], who by reason of his skillful
management of the property of the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company while
be was receiver of that corporation was
elected to be president and general
manager of the reorganized company, is
in the City for the purpose of adjusting
the differences between his company and
the Southern Pacific Company, and also
those that have existed with the North
Pacific Steamship Company. Should he
succeed in bringing about a harmonious
arrangement there would be an imme
diate restoration of freight rates between
San Francisco and Portland.
For three or four years the war between
the Oregon Railway and Navigation Com
pany and the Southern Pacific Company
in the first instance and that between the
Oregon Railway and Navigation Company
and North Pacific Steamship Company
later resulted in rates being cut to such an
extent that every carrier operating be
tween here and Portland has been losing
heavily. All interests involved are now
heartily sick of the fight, and in a mood,
it is believed, to make concessions to bring
about peace.
After the North Pacific Steamship Com
pany, whose steamers also touch at Coos
and Humboldt bays, began to cut rates to
Portland the Oregon Railway and Navi
gation Company put on a special steamer,
the Arcata, to cut into the way business of
its rival.
It is understood that one of the out
comes of peece will be the withdrawal of
tne Arcata from the Coos and Humboldt
Bay route, in consideration of the North
Pacific Steamship Company agreeing to
maintain rates to Portland at such figures
as may be agreed upon.
During the height of the rate war freight
in some instances was taken by the water
carriers for as low as 25 cents a ton, and
owing to the low rates prevailing over the
water lines the Southern Pacific, for some
time past, has virtually been out of the
freight business between here and Port
land.
While rates will be considerably ad
vanced as soon as the terms of peace have
been agreed upon and ratified, they will
it is stated, be Kept at so low a figure as
not to invite outside competition.

The services to be held at the People's

BROKE INTO JAIL.
Edward Krirkion Tells a Story *Â» to
Why lie Kobbed Uncle Sam's
Mail Box.
Edward Erickron, a self-confessed mem
ber of the Weary Willie Rant,/ occupies a
cell at the County Jail. He is charged by
the local postal authorities with robbing a
mail box, though the Government has no
evidence to convict further than the man's
own testimony.
In fact Erickson has such a hard-luck
story to tell that if he is finally given a
lodging place in San Quentin, it may be
largely attributed to a sentimental feeling
on the part of the jury.
It appears that Erickson is a hard
working Swede who left his native land
some four years ago, impressed with the
idea that American coin could be almost
had for the asking. Arriving in New
York he found this kind of thing a mere
delusion, and forthwith concluded to seek
his fortune on the Pacific Slope. As he
journeyed westward matters financial
seemed to become more contracted, until
finally the enthusiastic Swede developed
into an humble member of the "Weary
Willie" gang. J-
In San Francisco Erickson found things
no better than in the East or Middle
West. He followed the old drag of beg
ging along the streets and then made a
house-to-house canvass of it. "When
these leads had been gone over again and
again," he said in his statement before
Commissioner Heacock, "I concluded
there was nothing left for me but to break
k into jail. I had tried to secure work, but
coula never succeed. I asked a policeman
out in the Mission to lock me up, so that
I might get a square meal.
"He refused to do anything of the kind,
and I then adopted the most certain way I
could think of to get a good meal. 'I broke
open a mailbox, but 1 knew there was
nothing in it, for the postman had just
passed.. , I was arrested, however, and for
three days now I have had good square
meals and a place to â  rest. It is dreadful
to be hungry, ana I don't care how lone
they give me."
Erickson was heljd to answer before the
United States District Court. He is sub
ject to a penalty of from one to three
years, and the Swede says he hopes he will
get the limit.
THE FAIR CASE.
Contest of the Famoua Pencil Will

Morning.
The contest of the pencil will of Jamea
G. Pair is set for trial to-morrow morning,
and all the attorneys in the case have

sence of Mrs. Theresa Oelnchs and Vir
ginia Fair, who have been subpenaed by
them. J
Judge Slack yesterday decided that
Charles L. Fair must sign his deposition,
although it contains questions^ he refused
to answer. Attorneys Charles Wheeler
and Russell Wilson will also have to tes
tify belore a commission, his Honor bold-
Ing that the affidavits alleging that they
possess information material to the case
are all that the statutes require.
A Fraud nlent Draft.
J. L. Waller of Waller Bros., druggists,
Geary street and Grant avenue, swore to a com
plaint In Judge Conlan's court yesterday,
charging A. VV. Wllbanks with obtaining
money by false pretemes. Last Tuesday Wi'
banks represented to tne firm that he was an I
agent for the Chicago Label and Lithograph
Box Company, and that they owed hla .$l5O. I
He presented a draft for that amount on the
company and Waller Bros, advanced the
amount The draft was sent to Chitaeo and
Waller Bros, received a dispatch yeslerdav
that Wilbanks %vas not in their employment
and that the draft would not be honored.

ago, and Boyle, who is only 17 years of
age, is accused of being one of his assail
ant-.
Sunday night two weeks ago Lynch, in
an intoxicated condition, was being led
home by a boy named Willie Smith.
Wiiile on Vallejo street, near Battery,
Lynch was attacked by three boys. He
wa3 knocked down and kicked on the
head, legs and body. Two of the assail
ants ran away, but Boyle remained and
stabbed Lynch behind the ear with a pair
of shears.
The boy Smith notified Policeman Hen
neberry, who had Lynch removed to the
Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Fitzgibbon
dressed tiie wound behind the ear. Lynch
was taken to his home, but on the follow
ing Thursday he was again taken to the
lleceiving Hospital in an unconscious con
dition nnd Dr. Weil ordered his removal
to the City and County Hospital, where it
was found that his skull was fractured,
his body was a mass of bruises and con
tusions and erysipelas had set iv from the
wound behind hU ear.
Boyle, who was employed in the stables
of Gray Bros., was arrested by Policeman
Henneberry on Thursday, October 29. He
is a hard-looking boy, and according to
the police beats a bad reputation on
Vallejo street, where his parents reside.
He denies knowing about the attack on
Lynch, but the police say they have wit
nesses who will prove that he was the
principal assailant.
Fiona what the police can gather the
attacK was entirely unprovoked. Lynch
and the boy Smith were walking quieily
along the street when Boyle and the other
boys pushed against Lynch. Then, with
out a word being saio, Lynch was struck
in the face and fell to me ground, when
the three boys jumped upon him and bent
and kicked him most unmercifully.
Policeman Henneberry, who has been
specially detailed on tbe case, has not yet
been able to lay his hands upon Boyle's
two companions, but he expects soon to
have them in custody.
Lynch's body was removed to the
Morgue and an inquest will be held.
