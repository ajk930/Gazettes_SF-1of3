McKinley as H; Expounds the
Truths of Republicanism.
CANTON, Ohio, 6ept 22.â Three dele
gations called on Major McKinley to-day
and he addressed them all. Despite a
drizzling rain that continued throughout
the morning and a strong northwest wind
that blew cold during the afternoon, the
enthusiasm displayed was unabated. The
Holmes County farmers were the first to
arrive. Major McKinley spoke to them in
part as follows:
Six years ago free trade was to be the cure
for all our ills, free trade was to be the panacea
for all our troubles. Well, we have now for
four years enjoyed partial free trade in the
T'nite'i States, especially in wool, and what
effect has it had upon tne woo -growers of
Holmes County and other wool-growing coun
ties? You know better than I can tell you.
Kow.it is free silver â free bilver is going to
cure ail our ills.
Why, my fellow-citizens, it doesn't make any
difference how free silver is to be coined in
the United States you will not get one dollar
of it unless you give something for it. [A voice
"Tnat's right," ana applause.] If we had
mints in every State of the Union and in every
county and in every city, ana the silver of th*
world was brought to these mints, silver
would not be any easier to get ior you than it
is now. .And, besides, in this country we do
not propose to have a dishonest dollar. [Great
applause.] We propose to have the best of
everything that's going. We've got the best
country and the best men and we propose to
continue to have the best money. [Great ap
plause.
This is another thing, my fell ow-citi tens.
This year the people mean to put at rest the
question of their honesty, which was never
doubtea either at home or abroad until put in
controversy by the allied parties in this politi
cal contest. I say allied partiesâ the one Â«
Democratic party assuming an old name, the
other a little older and falsely claiming to be
the prop'e's party. It is to the credit of the
country that the time-honored leaders of one
of the parties have indignantly repudiated
those who have assumed to question the pub
lic honor in the name of Democracy. [Ap
plause.]
The people in November will repudiate the
other part of the combination for assuming
the role of dishonor in tneir sacred name. [Ap
plause.] The people have no patience with
those who would violate the plighted faith of
the Nation and stamp its obligation with dis
honor. They will not tolerate repudiation of
public order or private dealing. They wili not
countenance trie clipping of the coins of the
country, and they will never consent to clip
ping the currency in any form it may be pro
posed. [Applause] The contest should be
settled this year that no party can hereafter
alarm the business world and shake public
confidence by the proposition to scale our
debts, either public or private.
About 2 o'clock a delegation to the num
ber of 1000, from Cattaragus and Chautau
qua counties. New York, arrived by a
special train of fifteen coaches. They were
met by the Canton mounted troop and a
reception committee and escorted to the
McKinley residence. Among the towns
represented were Jamestown, Randolph,
Carroll, Frewoburg, Lakewood, Watts
Flats and Panama.
Major McKinley, bowing his acknowl
edgments, then addressed the crowd as
follows:
My fellow citizens, It is especially gratifying
to me to welcome to my city and home citizens
of the great Empire State of New York. It is a
proud thing to be a citizen of the first and
greatest State in the Union, but it is prouder
still to be a citizen of the mighty American
Nation. [Great cheering.] Your call at any
time would have been most welcome, but your
coming so far on such an inclement day to
testify your devotion to Republican principle's
is, indeed, a most impressive and significant
*<*â¢ 'â ; :, ; ...*â â -.
It is difficult to realizeâ and I sometimes
think that the country does not realizeâ that
as Immense as the great resources of the coun
try are, still New YorK is the first State in both
the vaine of her farms and farm products.
[Applause.] Your farmers, therefore, are quite
as much interested In the proper settlement oi
the free silver, tariff and reciprocity issues in
this campaign, which in importance dominate
all others, as the farmers of any other section
of the country.
The attempt to inflame the passion of the
West and South against the East is therefore
but a mischievous and unpatriotic effort to
â  rouse prejudice and hatred against men of
their calling, affected by the same causes and
feeling the same business depression as those
which disturb and harass the whole country.
[Applause.] I have uo sympathy, my fellow
citizens, with a cause based upon hate and
passion. It is beneath the aims and purposes
of patriotic freemen, and I am glad to note
that it receives no encouragement from the
sturdy citizens of New York. [Applause and
cries of "New York is all rignt."]
How strikingl' the names of the illustrious
Hamilton and the Empire State of New York
are inseparably connected. We cannot think
of the great events of\>ur history without at
once associating them together; and we can
not recall any example of like nature so con
spicuous unless it be the inseparable associa
tion of Washington and Jefferson with Vir
ginia ana Lincoln with Illinois. [Applause.]
No man of his time left a more lasting impres
sion on public legislation than the eminent
leader in New York, Alexander Hamilton, who
more than any one else secured her ratification
ot the Constitution, and than whom we are
more largely indebted than to any other
citizen for our protective tariff system, which
ho always steadily supported, and for our ex
cellent monetary system. [Applause.]
We have heard a great deal in this campaign
about the doctrines ot our fathers. Hamilton
favored both gold and silver as money, though
he preferred gold alone himself, and the Gov
The San Francisco Call
eminent of the United States entered upon the
use of both.
Hamilton announced the great fundamental
principle when he said: "There can hardly be
a better rule for any country for a legal ten.
der than the market ratio." In other words,
every coin should contain enough metal that
when melted it would be worth just as much
as when it is stamped as money, the bu'.lion or
market value always to De the same as its legal
or money value. [Applause and cries of "He
was right."] This was the doctrine of Hamil
ton and Jefferson. This has been the unde
viatitiK policy of the Government under every
administration and has been the settled policy
of all the great parties of the country from the
beginning oi the Government. By the act of
July, 1890, commonly known as the Sherman
law, v.c insisted upon putting into law the
doctrine of Hamiltonâ the parity of the two
metals must always be sacredly maintained.
[Applause.] The representatives wrote into
thai lawâ for both branches of Consress and
the President were in the hands oi the Repub
lican partyâ a solemn pledge, which is as bind
ing an agreement between the Government
and the people as was ever adopted.
Here is the language: "It is the established
policy of the United States to maintain the
two metals (gold and Bilver) at a parity with
each other upon the present legal ratio, or at
such ratio as may be established by law."
This was the act of the Fifty-first Congress,
passed by the Republican parly for the pur
pose of maintaining tne free coinage of silver
at the ratio of 16 to 1, but never to give silver
the greatest possible use as money, and for
that purpose providing for the utilization of
substantially the full product of the American
mines. (Applause.) This is not the only dec
laration of recent years in support of the Ham
ilton idea of their parity. The Fifty-third
Congress, elected in 1892, mid Democratic in
both branches, with President Cleveland as
chief executive elected by the Democratic
party, also recognised the doctrine of the
parity.
President Cleveland was so convinced that
the coinage of silver was becoming a peril to
the country that he called Congress together
in 1893, and Congress, at his earnest solicita
tion, proceeded to repeal the purchasing
clause of the so-called Sherman law, and in do
ing this wrote into our public statutes this ex
pression: "And it is hereby declared to be the
policy of the United States to continue the use
of both gold and silver as the standard
money, and to coin botn gold and silver into
money of equal intrinsic and unchangeable
value, this equality to be secured tnrough in
ternational agreement or by such safeguards
of legislation as will insure the maintenance
of the parity in value of the coins of the two
metals and the equal power of either dollar at
all times in the market and in the payment of
debts." This was the act of the Fifty-third
Congress under President Cleveland, an act by
a Democratic Congress and a Democratic Pres
ident, approved by a Democratic ad frustration
and indorsed everywhere by the Democratic
press, and, &3 I believe, by the masses oi the
Democratic party.
It is true we, as Republicans, can take satis
faction in the fact that it would not have
passed the Senate except at the earnest sup
port of the Republicans, and none more promi
nently than Senator Sherman himself. But
the Democratic party was solely responsible
for legislation then, and its action bound the
members of the party strongly to the support
of honest money, as the Fifty-first Congress
had committed the Republicans of the coun
try to the same doctrine. With what bad
faith, therefore, with what disregard for the
right, for justices and honor, can any citizen
now say that the Government shall ei.ter uj.on
any settlement Of our debts on a scheme of
coinage the confessed result of which would
be to destroy the parity between dollars, drive
gold from circulation and reduce i ho value of
silver and paper dollars in circulating nearly
one half? Hamilton and Jefferson, Jackson
and Lincoln, Grant and Cleveland never
taught a doctrine so perilous as that. [Great
applause.]
The peopie of the United States will never
adopt so discreditable and dangerous a course,
nor will they fail to brand it with their con
demnation whenever an opportunity is given
them through the ballot. [Cheers.] The idle talk
about the '-dollars of the fathers and the prin
ciples and men of 1776" will do no harm, but
It will never convince the honest citizen that
Hamilton or Jefferson or any other of our re
vered fathers or patriots ever viewed with
toleration any scheme of dishonest finance,
or contemplated for an ir slant the
idea that the United States wou'd cheat
its people in its money or repudiate
any of its obligations, made either by
expressed terms or implication. [Great cheer
ing.] Free silver means free trade. [Cries of
"Of course, it doesl"] Suppose you could pay
the duty with a 52-cent dollar, would yon not
reduce the proteciion you now have almost
one half?
My fellow-citizens, do not be deluded. No
matter how much money we have or may have
in this country, there is but one way to get it
and that is to give something for it. [Applause
and cries of "That's right."] What we want
just now is somebody who wants what we
have to give him. [Cheers.] Labor cannot
wait. The capital of the workingman is in his
strong right arm. [Tremendous cheering.]
If he does not use it, just that much of his
capital is gone and gone forever. [Renewed
cheering.] The capitalist can wait on his divi
dend, but the workingman cannot wait on his
dinner. [Great laughter and applause.] And
there is nothing so well calculated to injure
labor in the United States as a depreciated
currency. [Cries of "That's right, major, hii
triem hard."] I want to read what Webster
â¢aid March 15, 1837. Jn your great State: "He
who tampers with the currency robs labor of
its bread. He panders, indeed, to greedy capi
tal, which is keen-sighted and may shift for
itself, but he beggars labor, which is honest,
unsuspecting and too busy with the present
to calculate for tne future."
The prosperity of the worklnÂ£classes lives,
moves and has its being in an established credit
and a steady medium of payment. All sudden
changes destroy it. Honest industry never
comes in for any part of the spoils in that
scramble which takes place when the currency
of a country is disordered. Did wild schemes
and projects ever benefit the industrious? Did
violent fluctuations ever do good to him that
depends on his daily labor for bis daily bread?
[Great applause and cries of "No.no."] Cer
tainly, never. All these things may gratify
greediness for sudden gain or the rashness of
strong speculation, but they can bring noth
ing but injury and distress to the homes of
patient industry and honest labor. [Great
applause.]
Three cheers were again given for
Major McKinley when be had concluded,
and the nominee went through the ordeal
of shaking hands with the entire com
pany. At 4 o'clock the last delegation of
the day arrived. It filled ten coaches and
was composed of 600 members of the Mc-
Kinley clubs of Eikhart County, lnd.
Major McKinlev said:
I cannot forget as I stand in the presence of
an Indiana audience tLat it was your State
that produced that splendid soldier and states
man and illustrious President, Benjamin Har
rison [tremendous applause], whose adminis
tration for iour yearsof the Government of the
United States has hardiy a parallel in the his
tory of our country. Honest, strong, wise,
pat iotic, Americanâ an administration that
stood by the great doctrines of the Republican
party and that never turned its oack upon the
glorious old stars and stripes and the men who
sustained them during the four years of civil
war. [Applause.] We would be glad to be
back in those four year* under the administra
tion of President Harrison, ye*rs of highest
and greatest prosperity to the American peo
plÂ«, when every shop was ODen, when every
factory was running, when every busy, thriv
ing city of this land was active in its enter
prises and in its industries.
It has not been so in the last four years
[Cries of "No, you bet it hasn't."] You remem
ber that in 1892 the campaign was filled with
glittering promises; everything good was to
come to this country If we would only turn
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 23, 1896.
the Republican party out of power and put the
Democratic party in. Free trade was to re
lieve us of every ill or evil that had ever set
tled upon this country; protection was Â»
robbery, was unconstitutional, was a fraud and
ought to be repealed, and that if that party
was only given power in this country they
would repeal that law, and then we would
enter upon an era of prosperity the like of
which we had never known before. And the
people put that party in power, and the splen
did prosperity we have had since you know all
about. [Loud laughter and applause.] We
are not asking too much, my fellow-citizens,
when we ask for an American policy that shall
protect the American people in their occupa
tions and their employment, are we? [Loud
cries of "No."]
The people of this country never wanted a
chance to vote so badly in their lives as now.
[Applause.] And under our form of govern
ment it will only be about six weeks from to-day
until from one ena of the country to the other
we will have that chanceâ and how will you
improve it, my fellow-citizens? [Cries of
"Elect McKinley."] I say that it is not very
much to ask that we restore the American sys
tem to this countryâ it is nobody else's but
oursâ and if we do not make it what we want
it, it is not our fault, and I think the true
policy of the people of this country is to pro
tect the men who owe allegiance to that flag
first, the stars and stripes, and who will fight,
aye die for it, if need be, to preserve it. [Great
cheering.] And so 1 think the protective prin
ciple is nettled in the way I have pointed out;
and in the way of putting it into public law
you will have a chance to settle that next No
vember. [A voiceâ "We will give you a chance
to settle It," and laughter and applause.]
LIKE THE MILK SICK NESS.
Senator 2 hurt ton Unable to Find Any
Silver Intent Among Farmer*. Â
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 22. â Senator
Thurston spent part of to-day at Republi
can National headquarters, leaving in the
evening for Grand Rapids to continue his
stumping tour. In regard to the talk of
silver sentiment among the farmers, the
Senator said that wherever he went it was
like the milk sicknessâ in the next coun
tyâand he had not been able to find it.
Senator Shoup returned to Idaho to-night
to continue his work for the Republican
National ticket, and incidentally to be on
hand when the second State convention
of the silver Republicans is held next Sat
urday. The Senator said :
"I learned by a leer am from Idaho
that a new convention has been called by
Dubois. I think the bolters will substi
tute the fusion nominees for' their' own
on the State ticket, and if they do that I
claim the supporters of McKinley and the
St. Louis platform have tne better right
to call themselves Republicans."
W. S. Haggard of Lafayette, lnd., the
Republican nominee for Lieu tenant-Gov
ernor of Indiana, dropped in from a slump
ing tour. In the ninety-two counties of
Indiana, Mr. Haggard said, there were
only twenty-five "which would give a
Democratic plurality, and in each of them
there would be Republican gains.
Colonel Harrison G. Otis, editor of the
Los Angeles Times, reports an improve
ment in the California situation, and adds:
"The political outlook is propitious, and
there are unmistakable auguries of victory
in California, notwithstanding the fact
that the silver merit was very strong
a few. weeks ago." :.- .- '.->-- â¢ â  ftws*-.- â

MILITIA.

LAWLESSNESS TO BE PROMPTLY
bTJ I PRESSED.
Citizens Sworn In to Assist the Troops
in Driving Out All Tough
Characters.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Bept, 22.â 1n spite
of the continued manufacture of rumors,
the camp remains remarkably quiet. The
militia are here and in camp in the base
ball park near the Denver and Rio Grande
depot, while details continue to guard the
threatened points of attack.
No disturbances occurred during the
day. Tbe absence of the president and
secretary of the miners' union is still
noted and commented on, and the former
boastings of the strikers as to what they
would do when tbe militia should come to
Leadville are no longer heard. The senti
ment of tbe camp has found voice in favor
of law and order, and the reputable
citizens are now no longer afraid to express
their opinions. There is consequently a
feeling of safety in tbe city.
The delay of the special train bearing
the First Regiment from Denver, with
guns, cavalry horses and supplies, last
night, was due to extreme caution exer
cised by the officers and the railway com
pany. It appears that at every station
wnere the train stopp d wild rumors were
repeated, and the approach to Leadville
was made with the greatest precaution.
A flat car in front of the forward eneine
contained a detail of artillerymen and
three gatling guns, wHobwere trained
aheaa and on each suv following the
engine was a caboose loaded with sharp
shooters.
Between Malta and Leadville, a distance
of six miles, occurs a hilly country covered
with spruce trees, offering excellent refuge
tor riflemen, who could pick with com
parative safety the heads in the moving
train below. General Brooks had received
word that trouble was to be looked for at
this point. Tbe train was brought to a
standstill and three companies of infan
try under command of Major Verdeckberg
marched through the cut deploying skirm
ishers across the horseshoe and approach
ing rapidly the city.
At 3 o'clock the three companies, In lines
of four, marched through the streets to the
RiD Grande depot, where they wailed until
the appearance of specials. The men to
the total number of 650 slept in the cars all
night. A detail of guards was thrown out
and a picket line encircled the track for
several hundred yards.
The presence of 900 well-drilled militia
men with gatling guns and a troop of
cavalry has had a most salutory effect both
upon the miners and the timid citizens.
An incident occurred this morning
which quickly indicated the character of
the State militia. As Colonel Ho^le, who
was attacked with pleurisy last night on
the train, was being escorted to the
Vendome Hotel early this mornine by
Trumpeter Charles Lendhon of the First
Regiment a striker insolently sougnt to
pick a fight, calling Lendhon a name and
sneering at him. The trumpeter waited
until the colonel was in the hotel and
then chased the striker with his musket
down the street.
The City Council held a special session
this afternoon and, inspired by the ,
changed situation, took a decisive stand
to suppress lawlessness hereafter. A
large number of nrominent citizens will
be sworn in and they will be officially in
structed to hunt out all tramps and idle
men of no value to the community and
drive them from town. In this course
the militia will be asked to assist.
The City Council has located several
saloons and boarding-houses where arms
and ammunition have been cached, and it
has been decided to make a clean sweep
of both the lawless element and their
arsenals.
The Emmett mine will be immediately
started up, and the Bison and Little
Johnny will soon follow. This will test
the situation and fully settle whether the
union will continue to destroy property
and endanger lives with dynamite.
MARTIAL LAW DEMANDED.
Citizens of Lendrille Hire Ko Fuith in
thÂ« Civil Officer*.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Sept 22.â At a
meeting of the Citizens' Committee to
night it was decided to make a request
through the militia here to Governor Mc-
Intyre to declare martial law. Adjutant-
General Moses conversed with the Gov
ernor over the telephone relative to this
demand. The citizens of Leadville have
lost confidence in the Sheriff and his
dei uties, in tne Mayor and the Board of
Aldermen, and even in the civil courts.
They declare that no punishment is deal^
out to offenders, as numerous recent
events show, and they believe the only
way to suppress the desperate characters
oi the Miners' Union is through martial
law and military courts.
CRAZED BY LONG WATCHING.
John Daniels, a Wealthy Oklahoma/!, Kills
Himself in the Presence of His
Afflicted Wife.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Sept. 22,â John
Daniels, the richest man in Guthrie, O. T.,
committed suicide to-night by shooting
himself in the presence of his wife. Dan
iels went to Guthrie from Lincoln, Nebr.,
four years ago. He was worth several
hundred thousand dollars. His affairs
were in excellent condition and his do
mestic life was happy. During the past
summer his wife has been very ill with
typhoid fever. Two weeks ago his son
was stricken with the same disease and
for several days Mr. Daniels has been
threatened with the fever, it is supposed
that mental derangement from long
watching and approaching illness is re
sponsible for the suicide. Both Mrs. Dan
iels and the son are now very low.

Opening of the Regular
Republican Convention
Yesterday.
THOMAS D. RIORDAN ELECTED
CHAIRMAN.

Much Enthusiasm.
CROWDS OF PEOPLE UNABLE TO GET
INTO THE HALL.
Harmony and a Willingness to Work for the
Best Interests of the Party Char
acterize the Session.
The regular County Republican Conven
tion took the preliminary steps yesterday
toward regular organization, and ad
journed, afier appointing temporary offi
cers and standing committees, until 8
o'clock this evening.
AH the delegates were present in the
Auditorium when the meeting was opened.
There were no proxies or stuffers allowed,
thus taking it out of the power of one
man or any set of men to control votes of
absentees.
The galleries were filled with stalwart
Republicans, and about 200 were obliged
to stand out of doors, there being no room
for them even in the aisles.
Chairman Man waring called the meet
ing to order, and after announcing that
he would entertain nominations for tem
porary chairman - recognized John li.
Chretien.
Mr. Chretien said :
Gentlemen of the convention: I propose to
place in nomination a gentleman who has
lived not only in tnis City lor the entire time
of his life but was reared in the district which
he represents in this City. He is a Native Son,
a lawyer who stands high in the legal nroies
sion, a gentleman of acknowledged executive
ability, who has the good will of the commu
nity, and who will honor us if we will put nim
in the <hair to preside over this convention.
I the-efore beg leave to name the Hon. Thomas
D. Riordan.
A delecate, whose name was not given
by the chairman, said that Mr. Riordan
was that brilliant combination of political
truth known as a good Republican.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
On motion of Maurice L. Asher the nom
inations were declared closed.
J. A. Stephens moved that tbe nomina
tion be made unanimous, and it was so
ordered.
Mr. Riordan was greeted with a round
of applause as he took his position on the
platform. He said:
Gentlemen und members of the convention:
It is wholly unnecessary for me to state how
sincerely I thank you for the honor which you
have conferred upon me to-day. I desire to
say that those who nave known me intimately
have known me during ray entire life as a boy
and i s a man and they know how deeply and
sincerely I appreciate this honor and the
courtesy you have extended tom e.
I do not consider the time appropriate for
any discussion of the many issues which con
front us during this campaign, both National
and local. We have met here on important
business, not only of the convention, but of
tbe Republican party, which we represent.
But I desire simply to say of my efforts to the
> members of ihis convention that bo p*Â«*i<iiÃg
orlic-r can successfully control the artions of
a body like this or can carry out the dictate*
of parliamentary rales and procedure and
preserve harmony in its ranks unless the
members of the convention work, in sympathy
and harmoniously with him and extend to
him tr.eir cordial support.
I beg of you, members of tnis Republican
convention, the Rt-publican Convention of the
City and County of San Francisco-
Here the speaker was interrupted by an
outburst of cheering which lasted for
several minutes. When it had subsided
Mr. Riordan proceeded:
I beg of you to extend to me during the
deliberations of this convention your cordial
Â»up)ort, and in return I shall consider every
member of this convention, do matter what
â his political, social of business standing my
be, as a Republican, and all entitled to equal
rights and equal privileges on the floor of this
convention.
I shall, as long as I am able to preside here,
extend alike to every member of the conven
tion an equal degree of courtesy. I trust that
that spirit of harmony will prevail and that
we may extend to each other the bond of
political good fellowship, that we may present
to our constituents a ticket which will be not
only a credit to us but an honor to tbe City.

Good News of the Change of Senti-
ment In the Valley.
Georpw Crafts of Bakerstield was in the
City yesterday and makes a cood report of
the political feeling in the lower end of the
great San Joaquin Valley.
The Populists, who seem to be as hun
gry for otfices, irrespective of principle, as
are the Democrats, had fused on every
thing in sight, but they were making such
a pell-mell rush for the spoils tbat there
was no organization at all among them,
and that they were more like a disorgan
ized mob than any thin..- else.
Boss Cator of the Populists lias been
down in that vicinity fusing, so that be
and Stephen M. White oug.'t to get con
trol of the Legislature, lv Kern County
Cator has Riven the Democrats the Supe
rior Judge in return for the members of
the Assembly.
Mr. Crafts* has failed to find any Re
publicans in Kern County who are going
to vote for Bryan, while, on the other
hand, there are many Democrats who
have come out into the open and declared
tneir intention to support McKinley and
Hobart.
Kern County used to be a great wool
raising county, there being a Targe num
l*Â»r of Mexican*. Basques, Italians and
Portuguese engaged iv that industry.
They were all Democrats until the Wilson
act ruined their business and converted
them from wool-sellers to mutton-sellers.
They are working earnestly for McKinley
ana protection. A large number of alfalta
farmers, who had made the greater part of
iheir income -by renting abaifa pasture to
the sheep men, have been injured by the
ruin of their patrons, and they are sharp
ening their sheep^hears and mowers for
the scalp of William Bryan and free trade.

Judpe Short of Fresno Reviews
the Political Situation.
Judpe Frank H. Short of Fresno was in
this City yesterday, and had a good re
port to make concerning tne steady
growth of Republican principles in the
raisin and wool center of the State. When
Judge 6hort settled in tbat country there
was nobody living there but Missouri
Democrats. The Judge is from Missouri
himself, but he was one of tbe few Repub
licans who were allowed to live in that
State at the time be left It. Fresno County
in those days was hot politically, as well
as it is, and always has been, climatically,
and the few Republicans who existed
there were on the same social and politi
cal scale as the horned toad of commerce â
tolerated ant often trodden upon.
But the Republicans steadily grew in
numbers. A whole lot of them came from
the East, and despite the blight of Democ
racy saw that Fresno was a lairland when
irripat on water supplanted .th 6 light
niug-bui: sheep-dip sold in that city under
the name of whisky.
Judge Short, Dr. C ester A. Rowell and
a few other stalwarts kept the lamp burn
lug at the shrine of Republicanism, so
that to-dny all tbe important city and
county offices are filled with Republicans.
Toe dried fruit and raisin and wool
prowers, whose business was well nigh
ruined by the Wilson bill, ure enlisting
every day under the banner of McKinley
and protection and forsaking the Democ
racy, which has taken tue roof from over
their heads.
"You may safely put down Fresno as
solid for McKinley anl protection," said
Judge Short

At a meeting of the Continental Club
last evening the following resolutions
were adopted:
Whereas, To elect William McKinley and
Garret A. Hobart, Republican nominees for
President and Vice-president, requires the
nulled and individual effort of every Repub

MAHONEY SAID "NAW!"
No Nominations Made at Martin
Kelly's Convention Last
Night.
Chairman Sonntag Lost His Cue and
Caused Consternation for a
Few Minutes.
Charles Sonntng presided over the meet
ing of delegates of the Kelly-Mahoney
faction last evening at B'nai B'rith Hall.
Previous to assembling one of tbe lieu
tenants announced that the "boss" had
decided simply to have the meeting called
to order and then adjourn and go to the
Auditorium in a bouy. The first part was
carried out ail right, as the rolJcall of
delegates and reading of the minutes of
the previous meeting were dispensed with.
Chairman Sonntag declined to recornize
the Brat to move an adjournment, caving
tnat he wanted to present Henry 8. Martin,
who had beeu nominated at the previous
meeting for the position of Treasurer of
the City and County of San Francises.
Mr. Martin responded, thanked the con
vention for the nomination, and prom
ised, if elected, to discharge nis duties
with ciedit to himself and the Republican
party.
A second motion to adjourn was cut
short by A. Ruef r porting that the com
mittee on rules and regulations was not
ready to present a report.
The third motion *'o adjourn was not
beard by the presiding officer. Chairman
Sonntag was leaning forward trying to at
tract the attention of ex-Senator Ma
honey, who occupied a front seat. When
he succeeded in so doing, he said, sotto
voce: "Mr. Mahoney, are you ready ior
nominations?"
"Naw," answered tbe ex-Senator as he
kicked the sawdust on the floor impa
tiently. Those who heard the question
ana answer snickered. Chairman Sonntag
looked contused, but straightened out by
calling for an address from ex-Judge E. B.
Sawyer, who was nominated at the last
meeting for Superior Judge. The latter
expressed his thanks for tbe honors con
ferred and promised if elected to deal justly
with all without fear or favoritism.
Chairman Sonntag caused a little con
fusion after the Judge had finished speak
ing by stating tbat those who had any
friends to put in nomination could do so,
bin that the nominations must De accoiu
nied by $10 for eacb nomination.
The delegates looked tbe astonishment
they evidently, all felt, wiiile the ex-Sen
ator kicked tbe sawdust lavagely and
turned red in the face.
"I will read the list of places to be
filled," resumed the chairman appurÂ«ntly
unconscious of the surprise of the conven
tion.
"The first nomination will be ior the
position of Tax Collector, the"â
"Move we adjourn," shouted the first
delegate to recover his breath. The chair
man stopped aud listened to a friend who
whispered in bis ear. The motion to ad
journ was put aud carried without further
ado, and tiie delegates went immediately
to the Auditorium.

NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 22.âMadison
square Garden was crowded to overflowing
to-night when the candidates of the Na
tional' Democracy faced a metropolitan
audience and opened the campaign for the
Bound-money Democracy in the Empire
State. An hour before the meeting opened
the best seats were taken, and at 7 o'clock
1000 were standing in the hall. The au
dience was one o the best appearing that
has been drawn together by political
meetings in this city. A large number of
ladies were present. The audience recog
nized Rosweil P. Flower, William D. By
num, Colonel Fellows and others, and
cheered them as they male their way to
tneir seats. Among those on the plat- :
form were: Rev. Theodore Cuyler, Wil- \

B. Olney, Theodore Sutro, Colonel Thomas
Hurley of Texa<, Colonel J. M. Faulkner

Promptly at 8 o'clock Robert A. Wynd
mann, chairman of the National Demo
cratic Committee of New York, stepped
to the front of the platform and opened
the proceedings. He said that the good
old ship Democracy was going on the
rocks when the Indianapolis convention
took her in charge and placed able men at
her helm who were now manning her for
the fight which would bury Bryanism,
"Wntsoniam and Sewallism so deep that
Gabriel's trumpet would have difficulty in
resurrecting them. He then introduced
ex-Governor Flower, the chairman of the
evening, who said : . > hY t t
. Fellow Democrats, we are met to ratify tbe
nomination and platform of the National
Democratic Convention held at Indianapolis.
We are Democrats and not Populists. We are
In favor oi liberty, retaliated by law. We are
not revolutionists. We believe in maintain
ing our form of government m its full vigor;
the legislative department to make the laws,
the judicial. to expound them and the execu
tive to eulorce them. We believe in law and
order, not in riot and disorder. We believe fn
dollars of full international value, measured
by the markets of tne world. We are not 50-cent
Democrats. We favor a tariff for revenue only.
We declare that the Government should not
engage in the banking business. : We are op
posed to flat money. We favor the merit *y$- j
ternâ fewer spoils the less corruption in I
public affairs. We believe in economy in every
department of the Government. We Indorse
the administration of President Cleveland.
Our principles point the way to stability in
government, not to doubtful experiments; to
confidence In business, not to uncertainty; to
prosperity, not panics.
Fellow Democrats, let us take no step back
ward, but march in solid phalanx for the pres
ervation of our glorious republic and with it
the grand old Democratic party, Its ark of the
covenant for 1896 is safe In the hands of our
standard-bearers, nominated by the Indianap
olis convention. Palmer and Bnckner. And I
now take pleasure in introducing the tall
hickory of the \V abash, my old colleague in
Congress, William D. By num.
â¢' Mr. Bynum was received with cheers.
He started in by saying that after thirty
years 'in political life as a Democrat he
found himself unable to support the ticket
nominated at Chicago, for he did not be
lieve tbe candidates to be Democrats. Con
gressman Bynum vent on as follows:
If there is any principle that v cardinal with
the Democratic party it is the belief of that
party, from the very foundation of its organi
zation down to tbe present time, in the main
tenance of sound money. The question is the
all-absorbing question in this campaign. Our
volume of money consists to-day of Â»600,000,
-000 sola coin, of more than $500,000,000 of
silver coin, of f 346,000,000 of greenbacks and
about $210,000,000 or more of national bank
currency, of $120,000,000 treasury, notes
issued under tne Sherman Hot,- and about
$31,000,000 of currency- certificates Issued
under the act of 1572. All this money circu
late* not only throughout the United States,
but all over the world on a parity with gold,
and what the national Democratic parly which
assembled at Indianapolis and promulated a
platform and nominated a ticket insists that
all this money shall be maintained at a parity
withhold.
Our silver dollar to-day is worth not only
100 cents in tbe United States, but worth 100
cents ail over the world, and what we Demo
crats that oppose the free and unlimited coin
age of silver intend is that it shall be main
tained at a parity with gold all over the world.
While the monetary value. of our silver dollar
is 100 cents, the bullion value or the value of
the silver contained In that dollar, not only in
the United Slate?., but everywhere, is only 53
cents. If the policy of the platform at Chicago
is carried ont and our mints should be opened
to the free and unlimited coinage of silver the
effect would be to bring the monetary value
and bullion value of the silver dollar together.
Either the monetary value of that dollar would
change from 100 cents to 50 cents, or the bul
lion value of silver in that dollar would rise i
from 50 cents to 100 cents, or one would come
down aud the other would go up until the two j
meet at some point between the bullion and
the monetary value.
Mr. Bynum went on in an exhaustive
argument of the question. He aid that
since the Chicago convention the silver
craze had abated. He declared that the
statement of the Bryan supporters that
free coinage would advance silver is a
fallacy .V..- v * v
As Mr. Bynum was closing his remarks
the two candidates appeared on the plat
form. General Palmer was escorted by
Charles 8. FairchilU. who was Secretary of
the Treasury during President Cleveland's
first term. General Backner was escorted
by State CommUreeman John De Witt
Warner. The candidates were 'greeted
with hearty applause and cheers. Three
.cheers for General Palmer were given with
a will, and the band played "Hail to tbe
Chief. 111 1 General ; Palmer, placed himself
on a good footing with his audience -by a
few happy, off-band remarks. : These were
vigorously applauded. Then he took his
manuscript and read the speech. General
Palmer Bald : '.â¢â -.,- . â  .
;. lam here this = evening in the attitude of a
candidate for the . Presidency iof the United
States. Less â¢ than a month ago I expected
this appearance as little as any one of my au
dience. On- the 3d of December the conven
tion of National Democrats, representing
forty-one States, assembled in Indianapolis
and , honored .me by presenting my name for
the consideration of the people of the United
States as a candidate for the . chief ma giuracy
of the Republic. Ido not know, nor do I be
lieve, that a single delegate to that conven
tion expected tl>at I could bo or would bo
elected to the Presidency. Â« ln â  fact, in * the 1
preface to the declaration of principles made
by t lie convention It did not assert such an
expectation. .The convention was composed
of stern, resolute men. They were the Demo
crats of 1892, who contributed their efforts to
the election of that honest, manly Democrat
of whom the convention said:
"The fidelity, patriotism and courage with
, which President Cleveland has fulfilled bU
I gÂ»at j-uyUc wuiv; the Mgu -cUarautw vi bit ,
ministration; its wifcdom and' energy in the
maintenance oi : civil order and theenlor.ee
meot of law; its equal regard for the rights of
every class and every section; its firm and dig
nified conduct of ioreign affairs and its sturdy
persistence in upholding the credit aud honor
ot too .Nation are fully recognized by '. the
Democratic â  party " and will secure to him * a
place in history beside the fathers of the Re
public. :We also commend the administration
lor the great progress made ;in the reform of
the public service, and we demand that no
backward step be taken, but turn the reform
be supported and advanced until the un-Demo
cratic system of appointments shall be eradi
cated." . : : . '*:*-"
Alter paying this just and well-deserved
tribute to Air. Cleveland the convention lur
ther said in its assertion of party principles:
The Democratic party is 'pledged to; equal
and exact justice to all nreu of every creed and
condition ; to the largest freedom of the indi
vidual consistent with good government ; to
the preservation of the Federal Government
in 111 constitutional vigor, aud to the support
of the States in all their juÂ»t rights; to econo
mic ; public expenditures; to the mainten
ance of the public credit and sound money
and ii is opposed to paternalism ami all class
legislation." This declaration embodies the
Democracy of Jefferson and Jacksou and
Cleveland.
The delegates to the Indianapolis conven
tion, as 1 have said, were Democrats, ..not Re
publicans or Populists. lieiore the assemblage
of the Chicago convention they de.ired and
hoped for the unity of this great aud historic
party, aud they .would | have made any ordi
nary sacrifice to maintain that unity. But
when they saw the work of that convention
they had no iurther hope and felt constrained
to announce to the country that tne declara
tions of the Chicago convention attacked in
dividual freedom, the right of private con
tract, the independence of the judiciary and
the authority 01 the President to en loreÂ© the
Federal laws. They advocated a reckless I at
tempt to increase w,e price, of silver by legis
lation to tbe debasement of our monetary
standard and threatened unlimited issues of
paper money by me Government. They aban
doned for Republican allies the Democratic
came of tariff reform to court the lavor of
protectionists. '
In view of their fiscal heresy and other grave
departures from Democratic principle* we can
not support the candidates 01 that convention
nor be bound by iv acts. The Democratic
party has .survived many defeats, but it could
not survive a victory won in behalf of the doc
trine and policy proclaimed in its name at
Chicago.
It will be seen that the convention was not
composed of Democrats who would first vote
the ticket and the i read the platform, nor
was it composed of that particular type of
Democrat, who seemed to nourish with so
much vigor in the noble Stale of New York.
It would not be possible lor any delegate to
that convention to vote ior the candidates
nominated iv Chicago and reject the piatiorm
as unsound and dangerous, it therefore spoke
[ in no uncertain term-, iv condemnation ot the
platform adopted by the cosvea lions in Chi
| cago and St. Louis. â¢ -
The Chicago convention was regularly called,
and if it haa udhered to the faith the organiza
tion which 1 represent would nave been en
tirely unnecessary. Indeed, thousands of
Democrats to-duy have such respect for orderly
and regular organization that they feel almost
constrained to submit to authority. That
some Democrats should doubt the policy of
resistance to the action of the Chicago conven
tion is but natural. Taut convention as
sembled claiming to be a regular Democratic
convention, and thousands 01 us who resist its
action do so only because it was perfectly false
to Democratic principles. No Democrat can
object to the condemnation or the Chicago
platform of arbitrary interference by Federal
authorities in local affairs, so much is the well
understood Democratic theory of the proper
relations existing between the btates and the
General Government. '
Hut thereat meauing is well understood to
have been Intended as an indorsement of the
Governor of Illinois [hisses] and a condemna
tion, of the President for acts which were
unanimously approved by the Senate of the
United States and were strictly in conformity
with his duty as the chief magistrate of the
Republic " ,
That part of the platform which refers to tbe
money question attracts the largest measure
01 popuiar attention, Â«nd it is to that clause of
theCnicano plattorm and the corresponding
clauses of tbe platiorm adopted by the Indian
apolis convention that I propose to direct at
tention. I repeat the statement that the
Indianapolis convention in general terms as
serted tne true relation of the Democratic
party to the Interests ot this great country.
he Chicago platform declares and recognizes
that the money question is paramount to all
others at this time. The free coinage of silver
aÂ« interpreted by Mr. Bryan, means the ad
vance in commercial value of ail the silver
bullion and coin, and indeed all commercial
silver, to equality in commercial value with
gold. â â Â«.â '" â . , . " . =" ; K J;
The real question then Is, Can the American
people, by a la* authorizing the unlimited
coinage of silver dollars on private account at
the ratio of 16 ounces of silver to 1 of gold,
with full legal ..tender, . make the silver
coinage of the world of equal acceptability
and value and of equal power in the markets
and in the payment of debts with all the gold
coined in . tie word? Thin. statement of the
question is made In usual form, but neither its
truth nor Its exactness will be questioned by
any thoughtful man after he hits fully consid
ered the rapid methods of modern intercom
munication and the activities of commercial
life. [Applause]. ;
In my judgment such results ! as . I have 1 de
scribed are impossible of accomplishment by
the measure proposed. I admit that silver
bullion may be advanced in commercial value
by its increased usefulness, but no advance to
a parity with gold is possible, and the whole
result of the measure will be the depreciation
of the value 01 coinage, the ruin of public aid
private credit, the disturbance of business, the
disturbance of values and the overthrown^ of
all American industries. The Democratic
party, true to its principles and traditions, is
compelled to oppose it. [Applause.] It in
vokes the teachings und policies of its revered
sages to arrest the destruction of that great
party and save the country irom humiliation
and dishonor. [Applause.] . -
The United States must continue to enforce
IU own laws by its own methods. In the
States and elsewhere -the courts roust be sus
tained in the exercise of their largest author
ity. If legislation is necessary to enlarge, ex
pand, limit or define their jurisdiction tUat
proper legislation must be made by law mak
ing departments of the United Btates and of
the respective States. [Applause.]
The credit ot the United States and the
several States and the municipalities of the
States must be maintained. The people must
not be invited, to repudiate. To thwart these
disastrous consequences the ' National Democ
racy invites the co-operation of their brethren
and of all the people.
When General Palmer finished and had
been cheered to the satisfaction of the
crowd 'Mr. Flower introduced the candi
date for Vice-President. '
General Bnckner was received with great
cheers, and bowed his thanks.- Some one
shouted. "Three cheers for the Southern
general." which, were given. General
Buckner referred to the cordial reception
Southerners received at the bands of New
York audiences, and then branched into a
review of the Usue of 1861-64 and its rela
uoi. to the present issu a.
General Buckner then dissected the Chi
cago platform, and 'told his story of the
old musket handed : down from former
generations which bad none of the origi
nal parts remaining except the touchhole.
He said } that is all that is left of the Chi

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Sept. 22âWil
liam J. Bryan left Wilmington, Del., at
10:05 o'clock this morning and reached
Chester, Pa., at 10:23. He made the trip
in a special car attached to a regular train,
provided by the Chester reception com
mittee. Senator Gray of Delaware, one of
Mr. Cleveland's main supporters in the
State, was on the train and came into Mr.
Bryan's car. The candidate and Senator
talked together until Chester was reached.
A large crowd received Mr. Bryan at the
station. At Turner and Wood rows Park
Mr. Bryan was cheered by a good-sized
audience, and made a brief spetch. From
tbe stand Mr. Bryan went to tbe Colon
nade Hotel, where he held a reception,
leaving there in time to take the 21:43
train for Philadelphia.
A crowd of about 500 people were await*
ing Mr. Bryan's arrival at the Broad
street station of the Pennsylvania road,
which he reached at 11:45 o'clock. The
candidate left the platform and the crowd
cheered heartily, and Mr. Bryan bowed
his thanks as he hurried toward his car
riage. Mr. Bryan was driven to the La
fayette Hotel, which wiil be his headquar
ters wliile here. Awaiting in front of the
hotel was a small crowd of people, who
cheered Mr. Bryan as he drove up. At the
hotel was a delegation of about thirty New
Jersey State committee men. Mr. Bryan
was introduced to the delegation and then
went to luncheon.
At 1:30 o'clock Mr. Bryan was taken by
boat to Washington Park, a summer re
sort on the New Jersey aide of the Dela
ware River, where he spoke this afternoon.
Hon. T. J. Wrigbt introduced Mr. Bryan,
wno said in part:
I met a prominent man yesterday who said
that until the Chicago convention acted on
the subject he had i.ever Investigated the
money question and supposed that there was
nothing in it; that tne papers did not seem
to Consider it worth thinking about. They re
garded It as a craze, and ne did not have time,
as a business man, to pay n\iy attention to
crazes. But when a great National party
adopted a platform making the money ques
tion the paramount issue he began to think
about it. That was only a few weeks ago. lie
got to be a crank. Ue said to me : "If we don't
win this fight it Is going on until we do, and
we don't care how many > ears It takes." I can
appreciate the feeling of that man. I went
through the same experience myself. Until
six years ago I thought any man who talked
sDout money was h harmless crank. I did not
listen to his arguments. They had no weight
with me. I studied the question. I read books
on botli sides and compared them, and the
more I read the deeper became my conviction,
until I became so lirmly of tne opinion tbat
there cou'.d not be prosperity in this country
until free silver was restored that I was will
inn to risk a*ll I had on the correctness of that
conclusion. [Great applause.]
We have gone through in Nebraska the same
process that we have gone through in other
States. We began tbe fight in Nebraska. It Is
the pioneer, ihe piatiorm adopted at Chicago
on the silver question was first adopted in
Nebraska by the. silver Democrats there.
When we did it we had bolters, too, as they
have had since. We had men who claimed to
be Democrats who would not agree to our plat
lorin. They called themselves better Demo
crat-- thau we were and voted the Republican
ticket to prove it. [Laughter.] We believe
the Democratic party, which owed Us success
to the toiling masses, must still stand by them
in their fight against the few if it deserves to
continue iis existence. We urged in Nebraska
a free-silver league. The members of that
league made an open fight. They did not go
around in the dark wearing a mask. They
said to the Democratic party of the State: "We
are going to take possession of tne machinery
of the party if we can; we are going to submit
this question to tbe voters." We went out and
presented the questions.
When our State Convention met we had
three to one and we made that platform which
hus been re-adopted by the National Demo
cratic Convention. There was a fierce contest,
then we organized a bimetallic league, which
went out to do with the Nation what the free
silver Democrats of Nebraska had done in that
Â£tÂ»te.
When thÂ»y got to the National Convention,
some peopie came from New York to instruct
the delegates. A distinguished man who used
tocail himself a Democrat [a voice. -Hi.l"]â
no, Mr. Whitney, went down and said as soon
Hf the i eople of the West found out how the
people of the East felt about this subject he
aid not think there would be any trouble car
rying tbe convention against silver. He came
back home and found he did not know how the
people of tbe East felt about it. The Demo
cratic party In his own State has declared that
it unreservedly Indorses the free silver plank
of the NatioLai platform, and that it Is the

represented the sentiment of the people who
*ent the delegates to that convention which

It is sufficient honor to be nominated by the

have continued to study the money question.

Mr. Bryan then gave quotations from
John Sherman, James G. JBlaine and John
G.Â° Carlisle, showing them to have for
merly been in favor of the free coinage of
Bilver.
TALK ED IN PHILADELPHIA.
Crowds Turned Out to Hear th* Orator of
. . the Shallow Matt*.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Bept- 22.â Five
thousand people packed closely in the
Academy of Music, with a seating capac
ity of 3200, heard William J. ; Bryan de
liver the first of three addresses made to
Philadelphia audiences to-night. Many
thousands more swarmed in the streets
outside tne building, and the address was
warmly applauded. 1 â 
, An enormous crowd remained for hours
outside the Lafayette Hotel to see Bryan.
Equally great was the, assemblage that
thronged Broad and Wharton streets in
front of tbe Southwestern Democratic
Club to hear the third and last address of
the evening. In all Mr. Bryan's cam
paigning he never drew crowds of greater
magnitude and tbe Academy of Music
was entirely inadequate , for the principal
Bryan demonstration. It was packed
from floor to gallery. The doors had jto
be closed early in the evening, for : the
building would hold* no more, and those
inside were pressed together as tightlj as
could be.
But the crowd inside was as nothing in
point of numbers compared to the packed
masses in the streets. On Broad street,
outside tbe Hotel Lafayette, v great crowd
choked progress for more than an hour
before Mr. Bryan left the hotel for the
academy. Passage to vehicles was impos
sible, and even the extra squad of police
men who were sent to clear a way for Mr.
Bryan at the entrance found much diffi
culty in forcing their way through.
When Mr. Bryan left bis rooms to enter
his carnage several hundred men who nad
been held in check in the lobby and cor
ridors of the hotel broke through tue
tine of guards and rushed alter him pell
mell. With Mr. Bryan were .Chairman
Curley of the city executive committee;
ex-Congressman Kerr of Pennsylvania,
Congressman Sulzer of New York and
members of the local committees. Sev
eral of these were caught in the rush and
failed to keep up with the candidate.
Pieces of furniture wees overturned and
a crashing of glass bore witness to the
great rush that marked Mr. Bryan's pass
age through the hotel. Mr. Bryan was
sent flying along the corridors, pusued
through a narrow doorway and raced to
his carriage by way of the Sansom-street
entrance, thus eluding the crowd on Broad
street. There was a crush at the Academy,
but Mr, Bryan was finally landed on the
stage looking very much ' like the center
rush in a football game after attempting
the flying wedge.' Outside the Academy
was another mass of humanity packed
deep in Broad, street and lopping over
into the adjoining thoroughfares. It was
a good-natured crowd ana seemed willing
enough- to be entertained by campaign
oratois who spoke from trucks aud other
conspicuous places. â 
â  It was 8:45 when ' Mr. Bryan reached the
Academy of Music A wave of enthusi
asm swept through the overcrowded audi
torium as he came on the stage.
John W. Gorman, chairman of the State
Committee, introduced Mr. Bryan, who
received another ovation â asâ¢ be stepped
forward to speak.. Almost every sentence
he uttered was followed by loud cheers.
Mr. Bryan repeated his usual argument
for free coinage.

TREACHERY IS SUSPECTED.
Thaeher*Â» Letter Settle* All J>ovt>t About
Bryan JLositlo XeurTorlt.
WASHINGTON, D. â  C, Sept. 22.âWhat
ever pretense there has been at Demo
cratic headquarters of a hope that Mr.
Bryan had any chance to carry New York
has been abandoned. The letter of Mr.
Thacber adhering jto his Â«ound*nionÂ«jr
views, but avowing loyalty to the Chicago
platform's candidate*, was regarded by
Democratic managers as equivalent to
crossing New York off the list of doubtful
States and surrendering It to Major Mc-
Kinley. Ex-Governor Campbell tried the
experiment of running a 'sound-none/
man on a free-silver platform in Ohio two
years ago, and the' result was a plurality
of nearly 100,000 for Governor Bushnell.
The Democratic managers admit that
Mr. Thaeher's course has placed the party
in his State in a most absurd position.
Some of tliem believe that the party oweÂ»
it to Mr. Bryan to sacrifice the State to
principles and to repudiate Mr. Thacfcer
by the nomination lor the Governorship
a straigbt-ont silver man, and in this con
nection the young understudy of Henry
Olay, to wit/Congressman Butter, Is men
tioned. Mr. Sulzer has been bubbling
over with free silver sentiment and went
to Buffalo prepared to accept the nomina
tion for the governorship. It were better,
they say, to go down with Suizer and prin
ciples than to win with Tbacher and dis
loyalty. There is no grave danger, how
ever, of either contingency.
Senator Till man is here and disensnea
the situation in characteristic style. , H*
sees in Tnacher's nomination the cloven
hoof and the forked tail of his ancient
enemy, David Bennett Hill.
"1 is a deal between H:ll and Cleveland
to exchange tbe State ticket and the Leg
islature for the National ticket," said Mr.
Till man. "Tne silver men ought to put
ont a ticket of their own tor tbe governor
ship, either a Democrat, or an independ
ent." â :â /â ': . . â¢
Mr. Tillman added that there was alto
gether too much treachery to the National
ticket in various places; therefore, he bad
small hopes for Democratic success in the
East.
, Mr. Faulkner arrived this afternoon,
out he refused to make any comment on
Mr. Thacher's letter.

MR. HILL TAKES A HAND
Attends a Meeting of the State
Committee, at Which a Row
Occurs.
TALKS AGAINST FREE SILVER.
Senator Grady Urges the Withdrawal
of the Candidate and Wrath Is
Displayed.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 22.â A meet
ing of the Democratic State Committee
wa& held at the Hoffman House to-nigni.
The opposition to John Boyd Thaclier
was more pronounced than had been fore
shadowed early in the day, and when it
became known that Senator Hill was to
attend on a proxy the interest increased.
Chairman Daniorth arrived at the hotel
soon after 8 o'clocK, and at 8:45 the senior
Senator of New York went into the meet
ing-room. After a conference between
Messrs. Hill, Danforth, John C. Sheehan
and Norton C. Chase the committee was
called to order and the doors were closed.
bo much time was taken up in deciding
contests over seats of the representatives
of Kings, Niagara and Monroe counties
that it was past 10 o'clocfc when the real
business was reached. The rumors that
Tammany would not support the ticket
unless Thacher declined tbe gubernatorial
nomination were followed by a joint pro
test of other organizations, which was
handed to the committee for consider
ation.
The following communication was pre
sented to the committee:
To the JS'eio York State Democratic Committee:
Gentlemen: The undersigned believe that the
nomination of John Boyd Tiiacher for Gov
ernor of New York is a political error, most
damaging to the Democratic party and the
Bryan c*use.
II Mr. Thacher remains on tbe State ticket
we believe it will surely be defeated.
The popular dissatisfaction with this nomi
nation is so plain that we. trust that Mr.
thacher will be induced to decline the nomi
nation and that thereupon you will fill the
vacancy with a candidate who can and will
give his unequivocal indorsement to all planks
In the Chicago platform. Respectfully, Owen
J. Kindelon, president; John N. Bocert of the
executive committee New York State clubs;
Frank Halligan, president; Frank T. Bleyler,
secretary of Bryan League of Allied Printing
Trades, and others.
The content between the supporters and
opponents uf Mr. Thacher was precipitated
by a ruÂ»oiuiion offered by John B.
Bheehan in substance as follows:
Resolved, That we hereby request that John
B. Tiiacher withdraw irom the candidacy tor
the governorship so that the State committee
may be enabled to select a candidate In perfect
accord with the platform adopted by the
Democratic convention at Chicago.
Senator Hil! at once took the floor in
opposition to the resolution, making an
earnest appeal to have Mr. Thacher re
tained. His remarks occupied forty min
utes, and it was after 11 o'clock when Sen
ator Thomas F. Grady took the floor,
Mr. Grady was equally emphatic in urg
ing tlie withdrawal of Mr. Thacher, bo
that a candidate earnestly favoring free
coinage may be substituted.
Following Senator Grady, Messrs. Car
lisle and Bulger made short speeches to
the resolution, and it was midnight when
Senator Hill again took the floor for tbe
second time in tbe effort to prevent action
looking to the withdrawal of Mr. Tbacher.
Senator Hill said that the people did not
understand the money question. He had
heart! men talking with all. the eloquence
of statesmen on a subject which they knew
nothing about. He called it suicidal for
the Democratic party of this State to ac
cept the silverite principle. He would
rather see tbe party dead and buried than
Bee it damned by such insane conduct.
He said the committee had not power to
remove Mr. Thacher from the ticket. The
adoption of the resolution, be said, would
be political cowardice. The leaders, he
declared, are trembling in their boots.
Every man of understanding and intelli
gence in tbe Democratic party had taken
the right side of the money question by
refusing to support the free coinage of
silver.
There was altogether too much Popu
lism in the Democratic National platform.
When did a silver club become per se the
the Democratic party. The object of
these silverites was to drive to tbe rear
the old party leaders and have new men
rnn tbe movement. The movement was
controlled and pushed forward by mine
owners. Continuing, he said:
Do not be afraid of your own shadow. It is
probably true that a great many of the labor
ing people are in favor of free silvc r , but they
are in the minority and do not properly under
stand the subject. While Governor of this
State I never refused my signature to any bill
in the interest of laboring people.
Who dares to say that I am not yet a friend
to the workingmen and would protect his in
terest with, all mv power? The leaders of
Tammany Hall are afraid of the laboring peo
ple, but 4Jiey do notproperly understand them.
The effort to nominate a silver candidate for
tbe governorship of this State is an endeavor
to elect Mr. Black Governor.
Cannot the masses continue to trust us lead
ers, or have ihÂ»y become too suspicious of our
good faith? Why should lor Mr. Thacher ac
cept every line of the Democratic pmtform?
Arewegomg to allow a mine-owner from
tbe West to come bcre and educate the people
in a matter of politics?
Men who have offered their lives in the in
terest of the party are now called traitors for
refusing to accept everything in the Demo
cratic platform. I am opposed to the insane
ideas which the reoi-Us, the silverites, have
tried to have forced pa the party.
Senator Hill spoke for over half an hour
aud walked about the room gesticulating
as be talked. When he finished Senator
Grady aroÂ«e and began another reply.
At 1:45 o'clock this (Wednesday) morn
ing ibe committee finally adjourned after
adopting the substitute for Hie resolution
offered by Bernard Burk ot Kings County.
Tlie vote was in favor oi the latter by 46
to 2 and t c resolution read:
Rctohrl, That the chairman of this meeting
appoim a .ominittee of five to notify the can
didate* on ttiÂ« **â¢<* ticket of their nomina
tion, ami report bact to a meeting of this
committee, to be held Monday evening, Sep
tember '28.
The committee named was asibilowa:
Mr. York of Kings, Mr. Grady of , New
York, Mr. Moiloy of Troy, Mr. Cotton of
Chemune County and B. Beckwith.
After the meeting it transpired that
Senator Hill had spoken five or six times.
Members who had been present ex
pressed the opinion that following the
action :ofa the. committee to-night Mr.
Thacher would feel inclined to decline the
gubernatorial nomination.

Silver Republican Leaders Patching Up
' Matter* in Idaho. >â¢â¢
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 22.â The Silver
RepuDllcan leaders, Senator Cannon of
Utah and Congressmen Hartman and
Slip.f roth, were at Democratic headquarters
to-day conferring with Chairman Jones.
One of the subjects discussed was the
Idaho situation. The Silver Republicans
and Senator Jones are in accord as to
affording all the Democratic assistance
possible to Senator Dubois to insure nis re
turn to the Senate. The calling of the
Silver Republican Convention of Idaho to
meet again is taken to mean that an agree
ment has been reached to either recon
struct or take down altogether the Silver
Slate ticket in return lor the fusionists â
the Democrats and Populists â withdraw
ing the anti-Dubois resolution which was
adopted by their convention. The fusion
State ticket will then be the only one in
the field, except the McKinley Republi
can, and the way will be made as clear a* ;
possible for the re-election of Senator Du
bois. The Silver Republicans and fusion
ists have been given Bryan Electors.
Campaign Committeeman Johnson 3aid
he talked with the editor of the .McKinley
daily paper in Boise City when he was. in
Idaho recently, and the editor admitted
that out of the 27,000 votes which would
probably be cast McKinley would not get
more than 3600.
Chairman L. A. Rossing of the Demo
cratic committee of Minnesota was at
headquarters. He declared there was no
combination which could beat Bryan,
taking the vote of two or lour years aÂ»;o as
a basis. He said in 1894 trje Democrats
who are now against Bryan voted for
Knute Nelson, the Republican for Gover
nor, because it was a choice of seeing him
or a Populist elected, therefore the Repub
licans would not make any gain. Then
the Republican silver defection must be
taken into account as a clear loss, while
the Democrats had complete fusion with
the Populists, On this showing he was
confident Bryan would carry the State.
Ex-Senator Jnmes R. Doolittle of Wis
consin, Leo Bailey of the Indiana com
mittee, and F. B. Hemphill of Tennessee,
also called to see Chairman Jones and re
port successful prospects in their States.
â¦
Fusion, iÂ» Kentucky.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Sept. 22.â The
fusion of tbe Democrats and the Populists
of Kentucky was officially civen out by
Chairman Johnson of the Democratic
committee this afternoon. It is agreed
that the electors shall be put in Demo
cratic electoral ticket and the Populist
electoral ticket shall be withdrawn ; that
the support of both parties shall be given
to said electoral ticket so constituted, and
that all will do their utmost to harmonize
differences as to Congressional and other
candidates.
DISCIPLINE IN THE NAVY.
Officers Deprived of the Luxury
of Swearing at Their
Subordinates.
It Is Held That on the Seas the
Expression "If You Piease"
Must Go.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 22.â A Herald
special from Washington says:
Swearing at or harsh treatment of en
listed men by officers of the navy is in vio
lation of the regulations and will not be
tolerated. This has been brought forcibly
to the attention of Lieutenant Commander
Charles 0. Allibone, executive officer of
the cruiser Columbia, in a sharp letter
written to him by Acting Secretary Me-
Adoo:
The trouble which brought all this
about occurred on the Columbia several
weeks ago. Tbe first knowledge the Navy
Department had of it came in the form of
a resignation from actiner Boatswain
Dwyer, one of the petty officers of the
Columbia. The department was much
surprised to receive this resignation, be
cause of the knowledge of the good stand
ing of the young man and of his fondness
for the service. Suspecting that some
thing had suddenly Occurred to change
his good opinion of tbe billet he had, the
department wrote to him betore accepting
his resignation, requesting his reasons for
tendering it.
As was exrjected young Dwyer informed
the department that he found life on board
the shin unbearable, owing to ill treat
ment and abuse he received at the hands
of the executive officer. In detailing cer
tain incidents that occurred on board the
ship be charged that Lieutenant-Com
mander Allibone had severely rebuked
him, swearing at him and otherwise using
harsh language toward him.
When this communication was received
at the department a copy was forwarded
to Lieutenant-Commander Allibone and a
request made for an answer to th charges.
His reply came a few days ago, in which
he admitted having had some words with
Dwyer, but denying that he was profane
in the language used. His explanation of
what actually occurred was not considered
satisfactory by Me Adoo, and he accord
ingly wrote him a long letter, taking him
severely to task for his conduct, and point
ing out that subordinates must always be
treated with consideration by superiors.
If Dwyer did not properly understand
his duties, the acting Becrptary declared
that it was the duty of Lieutenant-Com
mander Allibone to speak to him in a
kindly manner and encourage him to do
better. If there had been an infraction of
the regulations which called for punish
ment of any kind, then tbe Secretary de
clared the acting boatswain should have
} been brought to account through the
legitimate means provided by the regula
tions.

ABE LANDED AT LEITH
Welcomed by the Prince of
Wales and the Duke of
Connaught.

Jayly Uniformed R- giments and
Crowds Torn Out to Welcome
the Visitors.
LEITH, Scotland. Sept. 22.â The Rus
sian imperial yacht Standart, with the
Czar and Czarina on board, arrived this
afternoon. The Czar, Czarina and their
suites were transferred from the Standart
to a local steamer, which conveyed them
to the jetty, where they were landed.
They took carriagt-3 to the railway sta
tion en route for Balmoral. The route to
the station was decorated to a moderate
extent with banners, streamers, etc. The
day was a holiday in Edinourgh and Leitb.
Great crowds were early on the ground to
see the Russian Emperor. Tbe gathering
was very orderly and the town remarkably
quiet.
The Prince of Wales, the Duke of Con
naught and Lord Rosebery embarked on
board the steamer and went out to the
Standart to meet the Czar and Czarina.
The Prince of Wales boarded the Standart
and greeted the Russian Emperor and
Empress, remaining on board the yacht
for some time.
Before the Czar and Czarina landed rain
began falling, spoiling the effects of the
scene of the flag-decorated warsh?ps in the
harbor and the gayiy uniformed regiments
of troops which lined the route from the
jetty to the station.
GREAT DAMAGE TO SHIPPING.
JCesults of Saturday's Thunderstorm on
the Atlantic Coast.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 22.â The
heavy thunderstorms of Saturday did a
cieat deal of damage to ships that were
anchored in Gravesend Bay. A boat
owned by the Marine and Field Club of
Gravesend Bay was capsized at the pier
and the Arrow was also capsized. A forty
rive-foot sloop waa smashed against the
Ulmer Park pier, and went down.
The greatest daiuape at Coney Island
was done to S. L. Rankin's toboggan slide
in Sea Beach walk. In the early part of
tbe storm the slide was lifted from its
foundation in several places, and was soon
a complete wreck.
The most noteworthy victim of the
storm was the famous little half-rater
Ethelwynn, wnich last year won the
Seawanliaka-Corintbian Yacht Club inter
national challenge cup for half-raters
from J. Arthur Brand's Spruce IV of the
Mimosa Yacht Club of England. The
Etbelwynn is now owned by Cyrus
Leonard of New York and his brother.
She was anchored off Avoca Villa, Bath
Beach, and was dashed aeainst the pier.
Several yachts with fishing parties on
board, which sailed for the Cholera fish
ing baiiks from Far Rockaway, have not
yet returned and some anxiety is felt for
their safety. Steamers which came in
just before the storm reported that a large
number of yachts were laid to just off the
banks.
EAGER FOR ANNEXATION.
Hawaiians Again Agitate the
Subject o! Union With
Uncle Sam.
Internal Dissensions and .he Influx of
Japanese and Portuguese Hen.
ace the Republic
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Bept. 15.â Much
effort has been made the past fortnight to
generate disaffection arnonc the support
ers of the Government, including the
Portuguese, by propagatinc the suspicion
that Dole and hi* Cabinet are not honestly
in favor of annexation, but are in accord
with t c British section of the sugar
planters in wanting nothing more than at
most an American protectorate which
would permit the continued importation
of Asiatic contract labor. The white me
chanics and laborers are strongly opposed
to the continuance of such immigration,
and their minds have been much dis
turbed by the suspicions put in circula
tion.
Interviews with members of tbe Cabi
net elicit the strongest expressions of
their desire to secure no form of political
union with th United States less complete
than the full admis ion of Hawaii as a
State or Territory. They regard a protec
tectorate as very unsatisfactory, contain
ing elements of uncertainty. It would be
liable to be terminate i like any trea v, or
to have its conditions readjusted. What
is needed for the political stability of
Hawaii is absolute union. Mr. Dole's
government is extremely anxious to nego
tiate a treaty of annexation as soon as any
administration at Washington will enter
tain the subject.
The wreckers of the Gains boiou .h still
have hope of floating the ship. The
water in tbe bold yields to pumping.
There has been some excitement among
patrons of the Punabou Preparatory
School on account of twenty-six Chi
nese youths having joined from Damon's
Milos Institute. White parents objected
to their children being in the same clashes
with Chinese, tbe school being select, with
high fees. The trustees decided toexemde
all not proficient in English, not being
willing to m.iKft any race distinction, as
the school is on a benevolent religious foun
dation. Under th.s ruling nueen of tlie
Chinese were excluded anu eleven remain.
The white parents are still not wholly
satistt d.
There is a large Government English
free school for Chinese youth in a 1 grades.
The city schools are much crowded, al
though frequently enlarged.
ROCK SPRINGS JSUXOATBV.
A Cloudburst J I nodi the Streets ot the

ROCK SPRINGS, Wyo., Sept. 22.-A
cloudburst up in the canyon, a couple of
miles soutliea-t of town, this afternoon
flooded the town to a depth ot four feet,
inundating floors in the First National
Bank and seven or eight of the leading
business houses filling all cellars find
completely covering the Union Pacific
tracks. The rush of the water down
through town was so sudden that there
was not time to get merchandise out of
the cellars. Tim Kinney & Co.'s large
double two-story business house is under

HYPNOTIZED FOR TWO YEARS.
Mysterious Disappearance and Return of a
Youth Who Has Traversed
the Globe.
BUFFALO, N. V.. Sept. 22.â Frederick
Gordon Rew, the Cornell student, who
disappeared from Ithaca in a mysterious
manner almost two years ago, and who
was found in Ceylon recently, has returned
to the home of his parents in this city.
For a ipng time after youn* Rew disap
peared his father thought he was dead.
Part of Rew's wanderings were sur
rounded with mystery. He declares that
be can remember nothing from the time
he left Cayuga until be found himself on
board a vessel bound for France. Aside
from these first days young Rew tells tbe
story of his adventures in detail. His
education enabled him to find friends
among a class of people who threw in his
way opportunity for profitable employ
ment, and he succeeded admirably in
learning French and German, his lack of
proficiency in which had worried him at
college and had indirectly caused him to
go away. He has worked hard since he
went away and has made money.
During ali his wanderings young Rew
never changed bis name nor endeavored
to conceal his identity. Before making
the voyage to Ceyion he visited several of
the South American countries and Jamai
ca. During all his travels he never heard
that his parents were searching for him
until he arrived at Ceylon.
He will return to Cornell on Wednesday
and enter the freshman class, as he did
two years a o.
JUMPED INTO THE LAKE.
Fate of Edson Keith, Head of
the Famous Millinery
Concern.
1.1 Health and Political Uncertainty
Belie vtd to Have Unset*
tied His Mind.
CHICAGO, 111., Bept. 22.â Edson Keith,
head of the great millinery firm, the Ed
son Keith Company, the largest firm of
the kind in the United States, committed
suicide by jumping inlo the lake at the
foot of Thirteenth street last night. The
suicide was not made known until late
this morning. He was seen when he
jumped from the pier of the Illinois Cen
tral Railroad, but at that time his identity
was unknown. Two crews have since
been dragging the lako for the b dy with
out success.
Later reports show that Keith must have
suicided Sunday night or early Mondr.y
morning. When Mrs. Keith tried to open
the door of his apartment on Monday
morning she found it locked. She sum
moned her son, who forced the door. The
room was empty, but it coulu be seen that
the bed had been occupied.
Believing that mental trouble bad over
come the missing man the police were
notified and spent ali day yesterday in a
fruitless endeavor to locate the miÂ«sing
man. This morning information was re
ceived that a hat and coat had been found
near the breakwater at the mouth of Wel
don slip. These were identified as having
belonged to Keith and convinced the
searchers that he had committed suicide,
doubtle-s while temporarily insane.
Physical ill health and the fear of possi
ble troubles to result from the coming
Presidential election are the causes as
signed for his breakdown. His financial
| affairs are said to be in the best shape.
He was interested in many great enter'
prises and was considered one of the
largest capitalist Â» in the West.

DISASTERS IN THE
MIKADO'S REALM
Hundreds of Lives Lost in
Japan's Floods and
Storms.
KOBE SWEPT BY FIRE.
Millions of Dollars' Worth of
Property Consumed by the
Flames.
EARTHQUAKES CAUSE HAVOC.
Reign of Terror in the Land of the
Rising Sun Caused by Many
Catastrophes.
TOKIO, Japan, Sept. sâ Hundreds of
lives were lost and a vast amount of prop
erty destroyed by a series of fires, floods,
storms and earthquakes in many portions
of Japan during the closing week in Au
gust. Ci August 26 Kobe was visited by
a conflagration that caused a property loss
of millions of dollars.
In Gif v prefecture 4300 houses were blown
down, and along the Haji-gawa 400 per
sons lost their lives. The severest storms
occurred on Aueust 30. Along the Isatsu
gawa eighty-four lives were lost.
At Kobe, after the fire had devastated the
city, forty people were swept to their death
by the flood. In other provinces the loss
of life reached 2500.
The great flood was preceded by a severe
earthquake. Then followed a downpour
such as has never before been experienced
on the island. The European residents
were panic-stricKen and sought shelter on
the highlands.
On August 26, near Kobe, the Minato
gawa first topped and then Dreached its
oanks, and death and destruction resulted.
From before midnight to after 7 o'clock in
the morning the fire-bells were striking
shor', sharp notes as a sijrnal of man's
strivings with an angry flood. It was
just after 11 at ni ht that the first serious
warning was given. The western bank
was broken and a swift current spread
across the fields and gathered in tbe low
disvrict around Hioso station.
The line was covered and traffic was
ultimately stopped, although in this
quarter the depth was probably never
more than two and a haif to three feet.
Passeneers from the west by one or two of
the late trains were kept waiting without
information for a long period, and were
finally told that tney could go no further.
One party of eight left the station on foot
in pouri:ig rain at 12:30, and after wading
for a longdistance they reached the Mina
togawa, only to be turned back by the
impassable flood on the other side. In
places in the streets this was already
breast high, and it rose higher without
abating one iota of its force.
Poiice constables and Red Cross men
were on duty everywhere; many rescues
were made, risks were gallantly but not
always successfully incurred. The parly
referred to with great difficulty pot from
point to point a ong the river's banks
right up into the hills. Not a brirlpa le
mained. They then, tired and wet through,
fought their way back and on to the river's
mouth. Three" hundred houses at least
have been wrecked; those damaged are
innumerable. Seven dead bodies 1 were
lound at one spot; nearly 200, it is feared,
have shared death by drowning. At an
early hour 3000 sandbags tiad been piled
into the broken embankment. Ropes had
been drawn across some of the streets to
enable communication to be made.
Late in the evenincr the fir* alarm
sounded and a fire was discovered in a con
fectionery, which was rapidly fanned to
life by the high wind. Forty marines
from the German warship Kaiser and her
entire tire department worked to subdue
the flames, but all to no purpose. One
thousand nine hundred blocks, including
2260 houses and twelve godowns were de
stroyed totally, and ten houses, two police
boxes, one fire- brigade station, four tem
ples and one theater. The burnt area com
prises ten streets. The total damage by
tire was 1,000,000 yen.
On September 1, in Rokugo district, a
terrible series of earthquakes shook the
country. Nne people were killed there,
and more lhan forty at Hataya, Senya,
Takanashi, Yokehori, Yokozawa, Naga
shi.ia, Shimi/.u and Fujiki, where the dis<
aster wat especially great. The hills ai
Senya cracked. Fires broke out here anc
there. Water gushed ont in many place!
and rumblin-.'S continue.
AtObonal elevn persons were killed
At Rokugo the people killed number non
than twenty, and the houses overturns
about 1000. A ferry-boat at Hizuraa cap

at the officers in the alley. Bricks were
torn from the chimneys and hurled at the
police. Bullets and bricks flnwin all direc
tions. When the combatants were sub
dued Michael Pizza waa found dead on
the roof. He lay on his back with the
blood gushing from two bullet wounds. It

FATE OF THBÂ£E LITTLE ONES.
Locked in a House and Burned to
Death During the Absence of

NEW YORK, N. V., Bept. 22.â A Tampa
(Fla.) special says:
Ninety-three political prisoners were re
cently ordered deported from Havana to
the Isle of Pines. They were sent in
chains afoot overland to Battomo, where
they were taken by steamer to their desti
nation.
The prisoners were guarded by 200
euardiaciviles, who shot them all down in
a lonely palm grove on the roadside near
BejucaL Tbe bodies were afterward hor
ribly mutilated with machetes. The
guards reported that the prisoners tried to
escape.
Letters from Havana continue to tell
stories of shocking atrocities committed
by the Spanish troops, and in many cases
these stories come from the Spanish them
selves. In one case where it was officially
reported that nineteen insurgents had
I.een killed in a battle it is asserted that
the Spanish troops had cruelly slaugh
tered nineteen non-combatants â men,
women and children â in revenge for an at
tack made upon the troops by ambushed
insurgents.
In another case three little children
were locked into a house which was set
on fire and the children were burned to
death. Another case reported is that of a
decrepit old man and two negroes, who
were brutally butchered.

PHOENIX, Ariz., Sept. 22.â The Repub
lican Territorial Convention met in Phoe- j
nix to-day and nominated A. J. Doran as |
Delegate to Congress. Every county was j
represented and much enthusiasm mnni- j
fested. As there is a strong silver senti- \
ment in the Territory it was feared that a ''
fight on the currency plank in the plat- j
form would be precipitated, but there were
only two dissenting votes on the indorse
ment of the St. Louis Republican plat
form.
The platform declares allegiance to Re
publican principles, favors protection and
reciprocity and Statehood lor the Terri- !
tory, and indorses the St. Louis piatform
of tbe Republican party without reserva
tion. It declares that While the Republi
cans of Arizona favor bimetallism, they
believe the Republican parly is the only
true friend of silver and will legislate ior
its coinage wituout disturbing the busi
ness interests of ihe country. Much
satisfaction is expressed by prominent
members oi the party over the peaceiul
settlement of this question.
A. J. Doran. the nominee, has been a
resident of Arizona fur twenty years, has
ht-ld many offices of trust and has never
yet been defeated. He has sÂ«erve i re
peatedly in both branches of the legisla
ture from Pinal County ami has a clean,
honorable record. He is very popular
with the working people, especially
amun: the miners, and. is considered the
strongest candidate who could hava been
nominated.
To-night a rousing ratification meeting
â was held in the Opera-house, which was
crowded from gallery to proscenium arch.
Tbe Republicans have not been so en
thusiastic and hopeful since the campaign

Walsh, secretary of the Democratic Na- j

teeman from lowa, has been visiting his
brother-in-law, H. M. Viele of this city,
since Sunday. He predicts Bryan's elec- j
tion and says McKimey cannot carry any
State west of the Missouri River.
"The backbone oi the silver sentiment,"
Secretary Walsh observed in a general dis
cussion of the political outlook from a \
Democratic standpoint; "lies in the great !
Mississippi Valley and not in the Western j
States, as the Republicans would have you \
believe, and I am satisfied that the fight i
in Mississippi has teen won and William j
J. Brvan is the victor. There is no ques- |
tion that lowa, Indiana, Illinois and 14in
nesota are for Bryan. Henry C. Payne, j
the astute politician ' who managed the
Western campaign, with headquarters iv
Chicago, until Mark Hannn took persona)
charge of the fight in | the West, conceded
that lowa and Minnosota were lost to the
Republicans. I am of the opinion that
lowa will go for Bryan by from 30,000 to
40,000 majority."
Walsh left Seattle for Chicago to-night.

Xot Diafranchited if Rel-axed Before
'Iheir Terms Have Expired.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Bept. 22.â District
Attorney Donnell handed County Clerk
Newlin an opinion to-day touching the
qualification of voters who have been con
victed of crimes in this State and after
ward pardoned by the Governor. Para
graph 10, subdivision 18 of section 1106, I
Political Code, provides that the County
Clerk shall examine the recprds of the
courts and cancel the names of all persons
apearine thereon who shall have been
convicted of infamous crimes, or of the
embezzlement or misappropriation of pub
lic moneys, and which convictions have
been carried inio effect. Newlin desired
to know if this section applied to persons
who have been pardoned before the expi
ration of their terms of sentence.
The District Attorney reviews the whole
matter, and holds that a pardon by the
executive of the State removes the disa
bility annexed to the offense, and in all
cases where a pardon has been granted
before the expiration of the sentence, the
names of such should not be canceled
upon the great register.

and the refunding bill, he said he was un
alterably opposed to any extension of
time; that if the Pacific roads did not pay
the roads should be taken by the Govern
ment. He was in favor of Government

The Bodhs of E:ght Mongolians Are

Shack.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 22.â The Jo
cal Chinatown's house of horrors haa
yielded its eighth victim. Of late the find
ing of bodies of Chinese in a certain shack
in the Mongolian quarters was a frequent
occurrence. Whether unfortunates are
murdered by highbinders or left tr-tre to
die from natural causes, abandoned by
their countrymen, is a mystery.
The empty siiack where the bodies have
been found has been the terror of nervous
white people who pass on that nide of the
street. Though many detectives have
tried to learn why this house should be
chosen by highbinders or others as a re
pository for dead, John Chinaman has
been too cute for them.
Later a policeman was set on guard and
watched the premises faithfully. This
morn in i: he took a look outside before tret
ting breakfast, and was astounded to find
body No. 8 stretched on the cold ground.
There is positively no clew as to bow the
body came there, although the dead man
was identified as a Nanaimo celestial.
There were no marks of violence about
the corpse.

MADERA OUTLAW'S FATE.
Wil iam Laverone Sentenced to Forty-Five
Years' Imprisonment at
Fo/som.
MADERA, Cal., Sept. 22.â Judge Con
ley to-day sentenced William Lavtrone to
pass forty-five years of his life in the Fol
som Stale prison for tbe crime of robbing
J. L. Ashlev of a gold watch and etiain
and $3 in money. The hold-up occurred
in April of this year near Coarse Gold, in
this county. Laverone was at once sus
pected, and he was found shortly after
ward with the stolen property in his pos
session. He was captured in a cave near
Bates with a partner who gave his name
as John Roberts.
The officers in capturing him were com
pelled to use giant powder to blast tbe
pair out of their hole. After the capture
of the two men they were brought to town
and placed in the County Jail, where they
staid about a week, when one nicht they
dug through the jail walls into tbe jailer's
sleeping-room. The jailer awoke and
tired two shots at ihe*n, but missed his
mark, one bullet striking himself m the
arm. They then overpowered him and
pounded him on tne head with a biick
until he was unconscious, robbed him of
his pistol, watch and other personal effects
and made their escape to the mountains,
where, fora time, the combined efforts of
the MaJera and Fresno ollicers to capture
them proved unavailing.
Two months later Laverone was captured
in Trinity County and brought to Fresno,
where he has been awaiting trial since.
VÂ« T Len his attorney was asked to-day by
tue court if he was ready for trial he stated
that it was the wish of the defendant to
waive his trial by jury and plead guilty
and have his former plea withdrawn. La
verone then stood up and the cour* im
posed a sentence.
This is the second time that Laverone
has been sentenced from this county. Two
years aiio he was sent up for grand lar
ceny, finishing his term just before he
committed his last crime. He is 21 years
of age.
SALEM CONVICT'S TALE.
"Bunko" Kelly Claims He Can
Locate Emna Merlotin's
Murderer.
To Secure Executive Clemency He
Will Cause tbe Assassin's
Arrest.
PORTLAND. Ob., Sept 22.â ex-con
vict recently released from the Baiem pen
itentiary came to Portland Sunday, and
meeting Detective Welch last evening re
lated to him some of the incidents of
"Bunko" Kelly's monotonous existence
at Salem, where he is serving a life 1 sen
tence for the murder of urge W. fiayres
in September, 1895. Among the many
commonplace . anecdotes the j ex-convict
told in reference to tbe murderer was one
of especial interest, whether true or not.
Dunn., the past year the ex-convict and
Kelly had a number of confidential chats
on Sunday afternoons, the only occasions
when the convicts can mingle with each
other in the huge stone vault used as an j
eating-room in the State prison. To pre
face the story told to Detective Walsh, the
murder of Emma Meriotin, a woman of
the town, on 1 hirdjand Yanihill streets, one
dark night in December must be recalled.
Up to this time the perpetrator 01 that
crime is unknown to the authorities, but
Detective Welch's confidential ex-convict
avers that "Bunko" Kelly, ( were he free,
could locate Emma Merlotin's assassin in
less than a month and furnish irrefutable
proof of his guilt. * '
Kelly is alleged to have said ' to this ex
convict that should be ever be the recipi
ent- of executive clemency he would de
liver the Meriotin - murderer into the
hands of the authorities, should he then
be alive, together with the "haneing"
evidence. According. to the ex-convict's
story, Kelly met the woman's assassin*,
three months after tbe commission of the
crime, in tbe Bella Union Theater, in tan
Francisco, two days before the murderer
sailed on a French bark for -Havre. Both
drang very freely that night, and in a mo
ment when the murderer lelt an irresisti
ble impulse to unburden his conscience
he related to Kelly, under a promise of se
crecy, all the horrible details of his butch
ery of the woman. Kelly did . not again
meet the fugitive murderer till the full ox
: 1893 in this city.
.Kelly also claimed to be in possession
of facts in connection with the murder of
Thomas Kennealey, in j the basement ot
the Hotel Portland, ,in November, 1886,
the perpetrators of - which crime were
never apprehended.

DEL MONTE'S FAKEWELL CONCERT
Sovffli Rendere Beethoven's "Moonlight
Sonata" on Organ and Piano.
DEL MONTE, Cal., Sept. 22.â Huber's
orchestra closed its summer's engagement
a; Hotel del Monte last evening. The
programme was lengthy, consisting of six
teen numbers, but the selections were ex
tremely good ami well rendered. People
from Monterey and Pacific Grove, as well
as the guests of the hotel, listened to the
lareweil concert with great interest.
Tbe greatest treat of the evening's pro
gramme was tne rendition of Beethoven's
"Moonlight Sonata" by Professor Souffli,
the pianist. This pianist's feat, if it may
be called by such a name, requires unlim
ited practice and skill. It consists of play
ing on a piano and on an organ at the
same time, using the piano for an accom
paniment. Tne two instruments are
placed at right angles to each other, and
Professor SouiHi sits immediately between
them. This is Souffli's first year at Del
Monte. He has played before many
crowned heads of Europe and was engaged

STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 22. -The sec
ond day of the fair saw anotner moderate
sized crowd in attendance at the track.
The programme gave district pacers an
opportunity to annex a purse, which af
forded about as much amusement as the
trot on the opening day, and there were
two events for the gallopers. The card
was just a trifle off-colored, but to-raorrow
the horses of the faster classes will score
up for the word, and as the gate will be
free to the fair ones of the opposite per
suasion a big crowd is looked for by the
directors of the society.
After traversing a long and tortuous
route, Pat, a big sorrel gelding, finally
won the pace, aided by the skillful driv
ing of Dick Havey. Castinette, an out
sider, scampered away with the five-fur
long dash, aud GreenJeaf finished ahead
of tbe other youngsters in the maiden
half-mile dash.
But three starters appoared for the word
in the pacing affairâ Belle, Hazel and Pat.
The latter sold a favorite over tbe field at
odds of $10 to fl. Belle took the first heat
without much difficulty and was then dis
tanced in the heat following. Hazel
walked away from Pat in the second heat,
after which the jndges changed drivers,
Green handling Haeel and Dick Havey
holding the ribbons over the big sorrel.
After beating Pat very cleverly in the
third heat, the mare came out a trifle
P ro P?y when the bell a^ain tapped them
out, broke repeatedly and was distanced,
and Pat's owner took down the purse.
Six sprinters faced the 'barrier in the
five-furlong spin. In the closing pools the
Oreeon mare Tampa sold for $10, Mt. Roy
for $6 and tbe field for $5. Charlie Boots
and Castinette made the running the first
part of the journey. Boots soon had
enough and gave away to Tampa. Casti
nette always I eld the favorite safe, and
won handily by a nock in 1:02. Tuxedo
wÂ»s a lair third.
The green ones in the half-mile dash for
two-year-olds did not cause a vast amount
of speculation. S. J. Dodd's pair, Utica
and Siidell, ruled favorites at $10, with the
Davis duo, Greenleaf and Ida, bringing
$6 and the field $3. Slidell showed the
way until straightened for home, when
Greenleaf got through next the rail, and
won with something to spare from the
Kvio filly in :49%. Slidell was third.
The 2:40 trot, tne 2:27 pace and the 2:19
class trot are down for decision to-morrow :
Special pace; three in five beats; parse $150.

ON STANFORD'S GRIDIRON.
Fair Co-Ed* Applaud the Practice Work
of Football Men.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Bept.
22.â A grand stand has been built at tbe
side of the gridiron and it is the fad
among the co-eds now to turn out in
goodly numbers to witness the work of
the football men under Coach Cross..
Last evening there were fifty men oat in
uniform, and their efforts were encour
aged by the yells of fully 500 students,
who watched the practice from the side
lines. Tbe play was spirited, but as yet
the men are new to the signals, unused to
handling tbe ball and altogether they
made a poor showing. Cross dovoted his
principal attention to the three center
men â Williams '97, Fickert '98 and Carle
'98; but he also did some work with the
halfbacks.
Cross is a good deal of a huntsman and
is anxiously awaiting tne opening of the
quail and duck season. He has already
arranged for a quail hunt with Professor
Angeli when the Ist of October makes it
permissible.
KIOIK IOS'S KENNEL SHOW.
Dogs of Fame and Sable Ancestry Placed
' on Exhibition. \
"STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 22.â Stock
ton bench show will open to-morrow. The
big pavilion was thrown open to-night,
but few exhibits are in place as the chief
effort has been made to â  have the bench
show in readiness. A{
A number of celebrated dogs arrived to
day, among them Tammany, belonging to
liarry L. Corbetr, and the collie Dude,
owned by J. Corbett. D. J. Sinclair, who
Is acting as superintendent of the show,
hasaliiterol fox terrier puppies out of
yueen Bess, a granddaughter of the fam
ous Dudley Strother, that took the prize
at the last New York bench show. By
the noon train the great English blood
hound from the Shasta kennels came, to
gether with a great Dane, exhibited by
the same owner.
This afternoon and to-night the local
owners of hifch-bred canines that have
been entered for the show have been busy
decorating the kennels that their pets are
to occupy. More interest seems to be
taken in the bench show than in anything
cisc connected with the fair, not excepting
the races, which are not up to the stand
ard of former years.
Mazzini Bros, of Sacramento to-night
sent two fine St. Bernards that they have
entered. H. McCrackon has sent Red
Glove and will have many other noted
dogs. There are nearly 190 entries, which
include some of the most celebrated doÂ« 8
in America that have recently been
brought from the East.

Nevertheless a man by the name of A.
B Messenger arrived in tbe Grove the lat

Rock restaurant. He dia a most flourish
ing business and materially intertered
with other old-established eating-houses
here. A few days ago, while the Califor

restaurant was attached for a $25 plumb
iiig bill and then all came to light. The
ciainis upon Messenger poured in, and it
turns out now that from tne landlord
down to the Chinaman of whom Messen
ger purchased vegetables no one wat< paid.
The place was closed about 10 o'clock onÃ
morning and at 12 the Methodist diners
lined up by ihe score for their midday
meal, but only to be met at tne door with
the attachment sign. Without one excep
tion tne ministers had yellow cards enti

$3 50. There were no more than four or
live meals punched on any of the tickets,
and the clergymen have them yet as me
mentos. Messenger left for parts un

on the stand, and the contestants endeav
ored to prove that Parker believed in spir
itualism, and that his mind was so weak
ened that, he consulted mediums in re

mony as being incompetent to prove the

TO SAN DIEGO
The Filibustering Vessel
Manned by Famished
Sailors.
FOUR DAYS OF HUNGER
Deserted and Robbed of Their
Provisions by the Junk's
Master.
LEFT TO PERISH AT SEA.
Sequel of the Expedition to Recover
the Famous Ensenada
Gold Bar.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 22.â The junk
Pekin, which left San Diego some months
ago to carry Garrat and an elderly man
named Coleman into Lower California to
recover the gold brick stolen in Ensenada,
and which returned off shore later with
Coleman, arrived in port aÂ»;ain this morn
ing and brought a most sensational story
of her trip and experiences. The boat to
day was in charge of Harry Lowry and
two men, and their appearance as they
landed on Jorres whan was that of wild
men, and starved wild men at that. For
four days they have been without pro
visions, and previous to that they had
been compelled to subsist on dry beans â
all that was left to them by Captain Frank
Colbert and a Mexican named Pancho,
who robbed the boat of its provisions and
deserted it and the three men at Hipolito
Bay, 500 miles south of here. When they
arrived here LoWry alone wai able to do
work as a sailor, the others being com
pletely exhausted. * In telling his story
Lowry said:
"I was on the Hongkong at Elide
Islands for guano. The Pekin, with
Captain Colbert, arrived there. That was
a'ter Coloert had landed Garrat at Ensen
ada and had returned with Coleman to
San Diego. He was running from the
authorities with his boat, the Pekin, and
had Pancbo, Grueben and Brown with him
as a crew. Colbert told me ihe wuoie story
of his trip with Garrat and Coleman. He
ovid that when he and Garrat arrived off
Ensenada they were becalmed, and about
that time the Carlos Pacheco was sighted.
Garrat became excited. 'Land me quick,
wet or dry,' be said, and he was put ashore
through the surf in a small boat. Cole
man stayed on board the Pekin. They
remained to watch for signal lights, but
saw none and lelt after twenty-four hours'
waiting. Then the Pekin pulled out for
San Diego, but remained oiu ide, and
there learned of the capture of Garrat from
a fisherman. Colbert then managed to
land Coleman in a small boat at La Playa,
inside San Diego bay, and got big pay for
it. Cieman sneaked through the brush
and left for Los Angeles.
"The Pekin then sailed south with
Colbert and the crew and joined the Hong
kong at Elide. Colbert wanted me to ship
with him on tne Pekin for tne South Sea
islands. He had a big scheme for making
money. I accepted the offer and iorfeited
$25 wages on the Hongkong and have been
borry for it ever since.
"We started for the South Seas all right
and made our first stop at Cedros. There
we were short of provisions and water.
We traded tobacco lor five wild pigs and
some provisions. We killed the pigs and
then found they were fishfed and the
meat made us all sick, so we had to throw
that stuff overboard and were short of
provisions again. But we set sail south
ward and next reached Turtle Bay. The
situation began to iook serious for us. We
nad not much to eat and the South Sea
islands were still a long way off. The
crew began to 'kick,' and we also be_an
to suspect from the actions of Captain
Colbert that he was trying to get away
from the boat and take with him tne few
provisions we had left. He had money
and if he reached land anywhere would
be all rigfct while we would be left.
"At Turtle Bay Colbert first showed his
intentions. But finally we sailed for Hip
olito Bay, which is 500 miles south of
here. Here we Â«aw that Colbert was be
coming desperate. His plan, it appeared,
was to take the small boat we carried with
us aud go ashore, leaving us in the big
boat. At 2 a. m. of September 4 I was
awakened by the noise of the bumping of
the small boat. I knew something was
up. I looked out of the forward hatch and
saw Colber; parading the deck with a big
dirk in his hand. Pancho was standing
by with a cocsed rifle. 'Get oack there,'

We were in a bad fix. Nothing to eat and

The weather was good and God saved us."

FISH COMMISSIONER.
They Present Their Biennial Report to
the Governor.
The Board of Fish Commissioners has
forwarded to Governor Budd the four
teentn biennial report of the work of the
commission. The report states that the
work of the commission is steadily in
creasing and its field of usefulness rap
idly extending. The board has increased
the hatcheries by the addition ol the Bat
tle Creek, Tallac and Wawona stations,
which are better equiDped than ever
before. The total output of fish for the
two years was 27,268,881. The fish indus
try, considered from a commercial point,
h&a greatly increased. Jn 1889 the catch
was 53,505,055 pounds, valued at $2,465,317.
In 1892 it was 57,838,466 pounds, valued at
$3,022,991. The report of the United States
Fish Commission, now being compiled,
shows a remarkable advance over all
previous years.
The report deals at length with the in
crease in the various families of fish
brought from abroad and planted in Cali
fornia waters, as well as native fish,
Lobsters, crawfish, clams, oysters, etc,
also received special mention. Under the
head of fish exports from San Francisco
the report shows that last year they
amounted to $2,583,468, an increase of over
$400,000 over the exports of 1892. Relative
to protecting the fish the document reads:
In the enforcement of the laws we have done
all that was possible, and while not claiming
to have covered all of the territory under our
jurisdiction, which would be impossible with
ten times as many men as our funds will per
mit of our employing, we do claim to have
given the food hshes all the protection the law
calls for and to have so placed our men that
the best service was rendered to the most im
portant interests placed in our charge.
The board in its report made a suggestion
that the members hope will be acted upon.
it states that the extensiveness of the ter
ritory to be covered makes it impossible to
handle all of the business attached to the
present commission. In nearly all other
States the fish and game are under the
care of separate commissions. The same
should be the case in Ca;ifornia. The
board suggested tn at the Legislature should
pass an act creating the office of State
Game Warden, who should have ten as
sistants, wnose duties should be the en
forcement of the game and fish laws. This
would give the Fish Commission a better
opportunity to attend to the propagation
of fish and the stocking oi streams and
lakes.
The commissioners also suggest that the
use of explosives in killing fish be made a
felony, instead of a misdemeanor. Another
sugjreation is that the present law be so
amended that the season for shooting and
for selling wild ducks be the same. At
present ducks may be shot for four months
and sold only during two months. Popu
lar sentiment is against this arrangement,
and the law cannot be enforced.

TEN-MILE POUT
The Steamship Chittagong
Loses Its Course in
a Fog.
FAST ON THE ROCKS.
Disaster to the Oriental Liner
at the Victoria Harbor
Entrance.
MAY FLOAT AT HIGH TIDE.
The Big Vessel Not Believed to Be in
Dangerâ Extent of Damage
Unknown
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 22.â The mourn
ful tolling of the fog-bell at the entrance
to Victoria harbor has become a familiar
though hateful sound during the past few
days, and to-day's weather was unani
mously voted the "dirtiest" yet by the few
navigators who did succeed in making
port. The most serious mishap directly
attributable to the fog befell the big Oregon
Railway and Navigation liner Cbittagong,
and that vessel is at present hanging by
her nose on Ten-mile Point, at the en
trance to Cadboro Bay, waiting for the
high tide to-morrow morning to float her
again. She had loaded at Portland a full
cargo of flour and bark, the latter on top,
and was, when the mishap occurred, on
her way to Com ox for coal to carry her
back to the Orient
Captain Hughes was off duty, having
temporarily resigned command to Captain
Corfield, his first officer, with the inten
tion of boarding the ship as she passed
outward after coaling. Considerable trou
ble was experienced with the fog on tne
way up from the Columbia, and passing
Race Recks and Victoria last night it was
too thick for the looked-for pilot to locate
the ship or the steamer to locate the pilot.
Under these circumstances Captain Cor
field was proceeding at slow speed, just
keeping the wheels turning, and taking
regular soundings as he advanced. Ten
minutes before the steamer struck the lead
found sixty-two fathoms of water. Then
there came a sharp concussion, and the
big freighter was piled upon a ledge of
rocks, just above Ten-mile Point, bow on
and listing a trifle to port.
The engines were immediately reversed,
but the vessel was held by her weight ana
could not be moved, beveral attempts
were made to free her by ihe use of the
engines, but all were ineffectual, and Cap
tain Corfield came to town and reported
his predicament to Captain Gaudin, agent
of the Marine Department, by whom he
was advised to lignten his ship forward as
much as possible, until it could be ascer
tained how firmly she was held.
Returning to the .-teamer. the young
skipper found her resting on an even keel,
held about six feet from the bow and
swinging easily.
When the cargo, fortunately light, had
been shifted aft she hung by the nose only,
and it is generally believed that she will
fl at off without assistance at high tide,
which will be about 5 a. m., the tide hav
ing been just at the turn and low when
she went on. Should she require assistance
during the night it can be readily ob
tained.
The Chittagong is one of the best-known
regular line freighters visiting these wa
ters. She is an iron screw steamer of 1241
tons, rated 100 Am Lloyds and owned by
Peter Henderson <fe Co. "of Glasgow. She
is fifteen years o!d and for some time past
has been under charter to the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company and
employed in its American-Oriental service.
The extent of the damage to the steamer
will not be known until she is floated.
UNION LABOR PREVAILS.
The Great Register Will Be
Printed Under the Direction
of the Unions.
Employes Compel the Boss Printers
to Come to Reasonable
Rates.
Union labor had a hearing before the
Election Commission yesterday, and it
won its point. The commission decided
that the great register could not be printed
unless vi.ion labor were employed.
The Mayor desired to award the con
tract for printing the precinct registers to
E. Heringhi <fe Co., money-lenders and
dealers in Japanese goods. He said he be
lieved that labor unions should exist, but
that Heringhi <fc Co. should get the con
tract, as they were the lowest bidders.
Creswell said he was opposed to letting the
contract to any firm which would take the
work out of the City, and he said he had
reason to believe that Hennghi would
do so.
Creswell followed up these remarks by
moving that all bids be rejected and that
the board advertise for others. It was
expressed in the resolution at his sugges
tion that only companies hiring union
labor need apply. Mr. Creswell nad a line
inserted which forbids the work being
taken oat of the City.
Creswell's motion to give printers three
days in which to file new bids was also
adopted.
MINES ON THE FRESNO.
Activity In the Grub Gulch and Potter
Ridge Mining District*.
'â¢There is a great deal of activity in the
Grub mining district," said John 8. Wil
bur, a well-known mining man of this
City, who arrived a few days since from
the mines on the line of the Fresno River.
'There is also considerable activity in the
Potter Ridge district in that vicinity.
That district is about 14, miles long by 4
wide and is a somewhat rocky country.
There is in that section of the country the
Gambetta mine, the Mammoth, the Buck
skin, the Starlight and the Soiano, which
are all in operation, except the last, where
the water bupply failed. The old 'Lucky
Bill 1 mine in the Potter Ridge district
will soon be operated by a company that
Has changed its name to the Syndicate
and Safe Deposit. This mine, winch was
worked in a orimitive fashion witb an
arastra, produced some $50,000 in four
years, but the owners quarreled among
themselves and were forced to selJ. This
is to be worked by home labor, not as some
of the mines s^ld to English syndicates
who bring out their English miners and
send all the products to England.
-'The district is on the south side of the
Fresno River, on the line ol the Raymond
road to Yosemite Valley, and is : not a
great distance from tho Fresno terminus
of the San Joaqain Valley road. The ore
that is obtained from the mines in that
section is of the quality known at free
milling, and produces good results.
"The mines give employment to a large
number of miners, and when the mine I
have named is reopened it will give many
more men a chance. The lode on which
the mines are located is from twelve to
fifteen feet wide and of great depth. Some
of the mines are now down 500 feel."

ASSAULTED AND ROBBED.
Mrs. Hughes, 1304 Post Street,
the Victim oi a Foot
pad.
He Struck Her on the Chest and
Snatched Her Satchel Oat of
Her Hand.
Mrs. Hughes, 1304 Post street, was at
tacked by a footpad and robbed, on Frank
lin and Geary streets, about 9 o'clock last
night.
She Is a partner in the firm of Mallory &
Hughes, room-renting agents, 22J^ Geary
street. She worked Jate last night, leav
ing the office between 8 ana 9 o'clock with
a lady friend. She, as usual, carried a
I hand-saichel. which contained a purse
I containing between $40 and $50, paid by
j customers during the day, and her private
purse with a few pieces of silver in it.
They walked leisurely along Geary street
till they reached the Unitarian Church on
the southwest corner of Franklin and
Geary. They had arranged to call upon a
friend on McAllister street, and Mrs.
Hughes left her companion on the corner
till she went home and left the purse with
the money.
She had observed a tall youne man fol
lowing her and her friend, "and that made
her walk hurriedly north on Franklin.
She had reached half way along the block,
when the tall young man ran swiftly up
behind her and struck her a violent blow
with his clenched fist on the chest, almost
taking her breath away. She gasped and
i mechanically pressed both her bands upon
! her chest. The robber seized hold of her
j satchel with both hands and wrenched it
from her grasp.
The streets were shrouded in darkness
and no one was near by to render Mrs.
Hughes any assistance except her lady
friend, who was too scared to do anything.
Her assailant rushed down Franklin
street, followed by Mrs. Hughes, who
screamed "Stop ihief!" and disappeared
into an alley between Geary and O'Far
reli streets. He made his escane.
Mrs. Hughes immediately went to po
lice headquarters and reported the rob
bery, cue was unable to give anything
like a correct description of the robber,
â¢who, she thinks, must have known that
she usually carried money in her satchel.

EMMA ASHLEY'S STORY.
She Tells of Her Struggles in
Bebalf of Her Sister
Lillian.
An Insanity Expert Testifies That the
Prisoner Is Incompetent
Mentally.
Emma A. Ashley testified in her own
behalf yesterday. Calmly, decisively con
vincingly, she told her story. So iamiliar
to her mind are the facts of her sister's
relations with E. J. Baldwin and so recent
the memory of their miserable lot during
the celebrated trial that terminated in the
atteinnt on the life of her millionaire ene
my that she rattled along, under her at
torney's guidance, with the volubility of a
phonograph and with almost as much im
passiveness.
In answer to General Friedrich's ques
tions, the flaxen-haired defendant told of
the main incidents of a life that, up. to
two years ago, was almost uneventful.
She spoke of her religious views and her
constant reading of her Bible, and then
came to her trip to California. The shock
she experienced when she found her sister
a mother, though not a wife, the struggle
of the pair to obtain a livelihood in Pasa
dena, and finally the journey to San Fran
cisco were gone into.
"During the six weeks of the trial," said
Miss Ashley, "we only once tasted fresh
moat. We lived on tea and bread, and
once in a long while a little ham. The
baby was nervous and restless and pleaded
for what we could not give her. When a
vegetable peddler would go by the house
crying his wares she would run to the
window and tease and beg for strawberries
or fruit."
Thu witness expressed a firm belief in
her sister's innocence of the charges
brought against her and told in detail of
her attendance at the trial of the suit
against Baldwin. She explained that from
the evening of Juiy 1 to the time she ap
peared in the police court her mind was a
blank, and that she had absolutely no
recollection of the shooting.
At the morning session Lillian Ashley
was recalled to answer a few questions,
and then Dr. H. A. Giimore took the
stand. In answer to a long hypothetical
question, presenting the facts in the pres
ent case, he answered that he believed
that such a person would have been
insane.
Tiie testimony given by E. J. Baldwin
at the preliminary examination was read
to the jury, and Reuben Lloyd, one of his
attorneys, retold the well- worn story of the
assault. Court then adjourned until this
morning at 10 o'clock.
THE BARON DE BATZ.
A Nobleman Commends the Mines of
the Distant Amoor, From 'Which
He Comes.
The Baron de Batz of Russia, who has
had a long experience in mining in Amer
ica and elsewhere, and who is one of the
best-informed mining engineers in the
country, is at the Palace.
He arrived here on the steamer Doric
yesterday from the Amoor River, in
Siberia, where he has been carrying on
gold placer rrining. He is now on his
way to Bt. Petersburg on matters pertain
ing to those far-away mines.
The Baron is no stranger on the Pacific
Coast and in the imermountain region.
He was for four years in Montana, where
be carried on large operations.
"Those mines of the Amoor River," said
the Baron yesterday, "are quite rich.
They are all placer mines where I was,
and five companies are at work. Of
these three are big and wealthy. The
Russian Government does not permit
Americans to mine there. I think well
of the country ana believe it will prove
very rich."
The Baron will only be here for a short
time.

In accordance with section 8, article XI of
the coastitution of California.
Who made the charter?
A board of fifteen citizens, subsequently re
duced to twelve, chosen and elected by the
people on November 6, 1894
How were these twelve citizens selected?
They were selected from well-known free

The charter was completed and submitted
by the Freeholders on February 4, 1895.
How long Is the new charter ?

ter, and very difficult of comprehension.
How is the new charter divided ?
Into fourteen distinct articles, defining
clearly the rights, powers and duties of caca
department of the City Government.
Is the charter an original production T
No. It simply follows the main lines laid
down in the best modern charters of the most
progressive cities of the United States, such as

When will the new charter be voted upon ?
The citizens of San Francisco will vote upon
the charter at the general election on Novem

(To be Continued.)
OAKLAND OFFICIALS.
Two of Them Are Prevented From
Enjoying a Four- Year Term.
The Supreme Court has affirmed the
judgment of the lower tribunal in the case
of The People, ex relatione W. N. Miller
and R. A. Hughes against John L. Davie
et al. and the City of Oakland. The action
was instituted in the nature of a qno war
ranto proceeding to test the title to office
of the present Board of Public Works of
the City of Oakland. The members of the
board claim title to office under certain
amendments to the city charter, Miller
and Hughes, former members of the
board, who were deprived of their office
in virtue of the said amendments, claim
ing that the election at which the amend
ments were voted upon was not authorized
by law, and, even if it were legal, that
they were entitled to hold office for a full
term of four years.
Justice Garoutte in his opinion enters
fully into the particulars of the election
attacked by Messrs. Hughes and Miller,
and with the concurrence of Justices Van
Fleet and Harrison, decides that it was
legal and the amendments voted For were
binding. This being the case, the second
contention of the appellants was held
untenable, the amendmeuts distinctly
provididg for biennial city elections and
impliedly abolishing four - year terms.
Hence Messrs. Miller and Hughes are no
longer "in it."
THE RICHMOND DISTRICT.
Various matters Discussed by the Point
Lobos Improvement Club.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club met
last night and discussed the improvement
of the Richmond district.
The Merchants' Exchange Association
announced by letter its intention to re
move dangerous telegraph-poles on Point
Lobos avenue.
The executive committee was instructed
to inquire into what method could be
adopted to prevent sand from drifting on
to Twenty-fourth avenue.
Mr. Crosswaite complained of unruly
boys in the night school and said that
there ought to be a male teacher there, as
the boys did not respect a woman teacher
and used the vilest kind of language in her
presence, and also beat and injured good
boys. It was decided to call the attention
of the Superintendent of Schools to ihe
matter.
F. D. Neuberry, a member of the clnb,
was indorsed for the office of City and
County Surveyor.
Secretary Johnson reported that the
Federal Improvement CJubs had decided
to vote against proposed amendment 1
to the constitution in regard to mortgages,
on the ground that it would be double lax.

NEW OUTFITS.
The Uniform Board Will Ask for a
Complete Equipment of the
Militiamen.
The uniform board of the National
Guard of California met Monday at the
California Hotel, and decided to recom
mend a complete new service outfit, in
cluding blankets and overcoats, besides a
mess kit for each pompany.
As the rifles now in use are of the model
of 1873, they also decided to ask the Na
tional Government, for the 1884 model.
The members discussed other phases ol
equipment which they will hereafter take
up. Colonels Fairbanks, Nunan and Cur
rier constitute the board.
''The rifles which we are now using,"
said Colonel Currier, "are nearly all twen
ty-three years old. Of course, when you
say that you say a great deal. They are
away behind tli'e times. So wo thought
it was only due us to get something bet
ter if we could.
"We did not think it well to recommend
so costly a gun as the Krag-Jorgenson or
some such pattern, so we have decided to
suggest the rifle of 1884 and to ask the
National Government to furnish them, if
it will. We will make other rcommenda
tions at a future time."
A Suffrage Night.
On Saturday evening last the veterans at
Yountville Home were given a literary and
social treat by a company ot distinguished
suffragists. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Mrs.
Nellie Holbrook Bli nn. Miss Mary G. Hay and
others, accompanied by Director Charles H.
Blinn, went up on tne afternoon train, and In
the evening; Mrs. Catt delivered an address,
Nellie Holbrook Blinn gave several recita
tions, Miss Maybelle Holbrook, violin solos,
accompanied by Mrs. Lee La Rue. Several
duets and the singing of war songs Inter
spersed the entertainment and the 600 veter
ans pledged themselves to the woman's cause.

Things That Grow.
It is an old familiar saying that. "Largo
oaks from little acorns grow." This may
be variously applied.
For instance, a man may have a gonor-
rbceal trouble which, in its inception, is a
very simple disease. With prompt and
proper treatment it can be easily cured in
a very short time. But without that kind
of treatment it often leads to diseases as
serious and complicated as any that af-
flicts the human body.
The trouble is that the patient tries to
be his own doctor, tries to cure himself,
or, what is still worse, he resorts to some
cheap quack remedy.
[ As a result his gonorrhoea soon becomes
chronic and develops into gleet. A little
later a stricture forms. , Then his urinary
organs get out of fix. After a while in-
flammation of the bladder and decay of
the kidneys set in, ana when this stage is
reached a complete physical collapse is
near at hand.
Men, beware! Do not travel over such.

diseases of this character, in all their va-

Doctor Cook is also familiar with the
latest and best methods of cure for lost or

GARBET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBEK 3. 1896.
America is for McKinley.
Europe has begun to, talk for Bryan.
It is now Lord Salisoury's turn to make
a speech lor the Bryanites.
Bismarck would like to try free coinage
on us but not on Germany.
We are not going to pull the silver chest
nuts out of the tire for Europe this year
nor any other year.
We are willing to help European nations
to restore bimetallism whenever they are
willing to do their share.
From the amount of advertising the Ex
aminer is giving the Popocrat fusion it
would seem to regard the thing as a
lottery.
Do you know any trade or industry in
this country that was injured by the Mc-
Kinley tariff? Do you know any that was
not injured by the Gorman tariff?
McKinley 1 s regard for the welfare of
workingmen is proven by every act ot his
life, but what has Bryan ever done to
improve the industry of any man in this
country?
Although Bryan makes some form of
attack on McKinley almost every day,
even his own organs do. not think they
are sufficiently important to be worth
backing up.
The American farmer needs no advice
from the European farmer as to how he
shall cast his vote, for he has a pretty
level head of his own, and moreover he
understands the situation.
Now that so many European statesmen
are advising the American people to vote
for Bryan there is a cnance for Sackville
"West to come to the surface again and
write another letter to Murchison.
When such stalwart old Democrats and
war veterans as General Sickles and Gene
ral Sigel take the stump for McKinley we
can justly say the soldier candidate in
this campaign is the candidate of the
whole country.
It is strange the Democratic organs
should take so much trouble to tell us
that European statesmen favor Bryan's
election when we have always known that
Europe is ever eager for a Democratic vic
tory in this country.
We know what conditions prevailed in
this country before the free-traders ob
tained power, we also know what condi-*
tions have prevailed since, and in this
election we have bad ample experience to
teach us how to vote.
It is customary in tbe East to refer to
the Chicago platform as a combination of
"repudiation, riot and ruin," and the
phrase seems to strike everybody over
there as being accurate as well as alliter
ative and picturesque.
The Examiner's support of Bryan is in
consistent with its often expressed views
in retard to the free coinage of silver with
out international agreement, but is thor
oughly in harmony wit_ what it values
more â its devotion to fakes.
"The free silver movement in Illinois,"
said tbe Examiner on June 7, 1895, "has
not been helped by its identification with
Governor Altgeld." The question now
arises whether it has been helped in Cali
fornia by identification with tbe Exam
iner.
m
Since the statesmen of Europe are Â«o
favorable to the remonetization of silver
it would seem there will be very little
trouble for tbe incoming Republican ad
ministration to carry out the pledge to
promote free coinage by international
agreement
The Popocrat fusion is as much in favor
of tree trade as was the old Democratic
party. It will be remembered that when
the Dingley bill to raise a revenue by a
riutv on wool was before the Senate the
Populistsâ Peffer, Kyle, Allen and Butler
âvoted with the Democrats against it and
thus prevented the wool men from having
the protection the Republicans would
have given them.
In reply to a correspondent the Exam
iner said on June 27, 1895: "The coinage
of silver under proper international agree
ment would nelp our trade with all the
world, but free coinage by this country
alone, unless it succeeded in bringing both
metals to a parity, which would hardly be
possible, wonld cartainly injure our com
merce with countries having the gold
standard." As the Examiner now urges
the free coinage of silver without inter
national agreement the only possible in
ference is that it is willing to injure our
commerce lor the purpose of increasing
the value of Mr. Hearst's silver mines.
THE MUNICIPAL CONVENTION.
The Regular Republican Municipal Con-
vention met yesterday in the Auditorium
and organized for the transaction of busi
ness. The business which this convention
is to transact is of the utmost political
importance to the people of San Fran
cisco and especially to those of its citizens
who by reason of their material interests
are immediately concerned in seeing the
offices of the City filled by honest men
and in having its affairs wisely and justly
administered.
The attention of all such citizens is
called to the fact that this convention is
tne only regular and legal representative
of the Republican party of San Francisco.
Its claim to this title rests upon the un
broicen and unquestioned descent of its
! power from the convention and campaign
j of 1894 and through the regular County
j Committee then called into being in tbe
j utual and legal way. It therefore repre
{ sents the integrity of the party organiza
! tion and every loyal Republican should so
regard it
Tbe fact that there are certain persons in
this City who claim to be Republicans and
to be loyal to their party, and yet who do
not submit to its regularly constituted
authority, is a matter of serious concern
to every Republican who is honestly de
sirous of party success. It is almost an
axiom that discords and dissensions
within a political party during a cam
paign bring only a harvest of disaster and
defeat. In the light of these results those
who foment rebellion and encourage dis
cord are guilty of little less than treason
to their party and its nominees.
Every factional dissension loses votes
for the entire ticket and henco should be
discouraged by all Republicans who be
lieve in party loyalty and labor for party
success. The most practical anu effective
way to discourage such disloyalty is to
join hands heartily and openly with the
regular and rightful party organization
and actively support both its convention
and its nominees. This especially if the
character and standing of those who com
pose the convention give assurance of the
nomination of men for the various offices
whose private integrity and standing in
the community guarantee bonesty and
fidelity in the fulfillment of their public
trust.
The convention at the Auditorium gives
ample promise of the nomination of such
a ticket. The expressed purpose of its
dominant members is the selection of the
best possible material for the offices to be
| filled. Such a purpose should have the j
j approval and support of the entire Re- j
I publican party of San Francisco, and in j
j its presence all discords, dissensions and
disloyalties should fade away.
The only road to success in this munici
pal election is through party harmony
and the only proper place to harmonize is
beneath the banner of the regular and
legal party organization represented in
the Regular Republican Municipal 'Con
vention which met yesterday and will
meet again to-night.
If our present policy is adhered to and the
coinage is kept uithin reasonable limits the
means heretofore employed for the main
tenance of the parity will doubtless be found
sufficient in the future, and our silver dollars
and silver certificates will continue to circu
late at par with gold, thus enabling the
people to we both metals instead of one only,
as would be the case if the parity was de
stroyed by free coinage.â Secretary Carlisle.
BRYAN'S EUROPEAN ALLIES.
A lot of dukes, counts, barons and other
brands of sharp European statesmen have
cabled that they are very decidedly in
favor of Bryin's election on account of his
advocacy of silver monometallism, and
Bryan and his managers are so proud over
being recognized by dukes and counts and
the like that the earth trembles (in their
mind) when they walk. The interest that
these titled gentlemen take in Bryan's
election would be an amusing episode of
the campaign were it not for the fact that
they are playing upon Bryan's vanity. It
is humiliating to Americans to know tnat
Europeans think a man who is big enough
to be a Presidential candidate is also
stupid enough to be played upon.
These dukes and counts and barons are
exceedingly solicitous concerning Bryan's
candidacy, and if he is elected we may be
sure that the great joy of ttieir hearts will
find expression in congratulatory cable
grams. The reason why these European
gentlemen are so anxious to have Bryan
elected is this: They know that Br3*an is
for free trade pure and simple, and they
know that if free trade prevails in this
country they will supply our markets
with their own goods and wares, and that
if Major McKinl*y is elected our markets
will be supplied with American-made
goods and wares. American politics this
year present* no aspect to Europe other
than one of business. European states
men understand very well that free trade
in the United States means employment
for their own wage-people to supply the
American demand for manufactures, and
they know tnat Bryan will put tills coun
try upon a free-trade basis and that Major
McKinley will not. Hence they are for
Bryan.
It will be observed that no European
dukes or counts or barons are expressing
any desire by cable or otherwise to see
Major McKinlry, protection and sound
money carry the day in November. This
count and duke business is a good thing
for onr workingmen to look inio. They
will find it worth their while to do so.
When foreign farmers, tnillmen and land
lords espouse the cause of a candidate for
President of the United States it is very
safe to conclude that it is their own and
not our interests they are looking after.
The Republican party at St. Louis con
structed a platform which placed us well in
the field. It stands for ample revenue, for
protection of American industries, for honest
money, against debasement of the currency,
against the repudiation of just debts; it
stand* for law and order â in short, it repu
diates the repudiators.â General Horace
Porter.
CONSIDER YOUR OWN INDUSTRY.
Producers and wage-workers, in this
election it is your duty to consider your
own industry. There is no selfishness in
such politics. If you do that which is
honestly be3t lor yon yonr action is sure to
be tbat which is best for your neighbor
and your country. Your work is an
American industry, and nil American in
terests are ao closely bound together tbat
whatever legislation advancesone will ben
efit others. As Shakespeare said, "To
thine own self be true and it will follow
as the night tbe day thou canst not then
be false to any man."
Bryan began bis political career as an
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 189f5.
advocate of extreme free trade. The Wil
son bill did not go far enough for him.
He would have put all American produce
as well as wool and lumber on the free list.
All tbat he could do to reduce American
industry and American wages to European
levels he did. He is now in favor of re
ducing our money to the purchasing
power of that of Mexico and China.
Have you profited from his free-trade leg
islation? Do you see any prospect of
profiting from his free-silver scheme?
When the Wilson bill was under discus
sion Bryan said: "I think the duties all
the way through are higher ihan neces
sary." These duties, however, cut down
protection on all American products and
removed it entirely from some of the most
important. Califomians suffered severely.
The duty on prunes was reduced from 2
cents per pound to I}^, on beans from 40
cents per bushel to 20 per cent ad valorem,
on walnuts from 4 cents to 2 cents, on
shelled walnuts from 6 to 4 cents, on
almonds from 5 cents to 3, on shelled
almonds from 7}_ tfc 5 cents, on barley
from SO cents per bushel to 30 per cent ad
valorem, on honey from 20 to 10 cents per
gallon, while wool and lumber were put
upon the free list, and tbe sugar bounty,
under which that great industry was being
built up in the State, was abolished.
It may be you were not engaged in pro
ducing any of these things either as an
employer or as a workingman. You have
therefore lost nothing directly by the de
crease in the duties. Is it not a fact, how
ever, that you have lost something by your
neighbor's loss? Has not the market for
your products been duller, your profits less,
your wages smaller and more irregular?
Have you not had your share in the de
pression produced by this breaking down
of the protective system? Have not the
cities suffered from the loss inflicted upon
farmers? Have not tbe farmers suffered
from the loss inflicted upon the manufac
turers and workingmen of the cities?
Issues occasionally arise in the history
of nations when men rightly turn aside
from self-interest to consider some great
i atriotic or moral principle. We have
had side issues in our country, but they
are not before us now. Free trade and
free silver affect business and roust be
dealt with like other matters of business.
Consider your own industry and that of
your neighbor. Vote for a renewal of
trade and good wages. Bear in mind that
protection means prosperity and that to
restore prosperity is patriotism.
If the l 'gold" candidate, Mr. McKinley, is
successful we may expect to see American
wheat, corn and barUy held very stiffly,
giving us in England higher prices in De
cember; but the victory of the "silver" candi
date, Mr. Bryan, would tend to throw all the
Avierican surplus of grain on the English
market at 6t to 10s per quarter {of eight
bushels) under current prices for wheat and
at 2s to $s per quarter less money for barley
and maize. Thus, abstain from politics as
we may uish to do, it is impossible to avoid
considering them in market estimates. â The

The publication in our columns a few
days ago of the inventory and appraise
ment of the Hearst estate opened the eyes
of the people of California to tbe real rea
son for tbe recent action not to say selfish
interest of the Examiner in the cause of
silver.
In our lÃsne of yesterday appeared an
other interesting collection of equally
authentic extracts showing that within a
year that "journal of civilization" has been
an active partisan on both sides ot tbe
question. We present today additional
and even more interesting data, drawn
from the editorial pages of our contempo
rary and furnishing an excellent plummet
by which to Eound the depth of its pres
ent sincerity in advocating tbe cause of
silver.
A year ago both the Examiner and its
Eastern double, the New York Journal,
advocated the present standard. To-day
both are garrulous and vehement in the
forlorn cause of silver monometallism,
which they denounced last year, and, in
the case of the Journal, even as late as last
July.
The excerpts from Examiner editorials
which were reproduced in our columns
yesterday were written with more feeling
and ability than is usual with our incon
sistent contemporary. They expressed
that paper's emphatic protest against such
vagaries and dangerous doctrines as are
embraced in the Democratic t>latform and
advocated by tbe Presidential candidate it
now supports. The further extracts
from the files of our contemporary
which appear in our local columns of
to-day are even more radical in their de
nunciation of the Brynn policy than were
the excerpts quoted yesterday. In what
appeared in the quotations printed in The
Call of yesterday the Examiner contented
itself in denouncing the silver mono
metallic idea as unsound, and in predicting
that it would cause the worst financial
crisis ever known in this country. It will
be seen by the quotations reprinted to- day
that the Examiner's editor grew so weary
of the vociferations of the silver men tbat
he called them children of the "Windy j
West," and in another editorial, speaking
of President Cleveland's views on money,
the paper says they "might be echoed by
every man of ordinary sanity in tbe coun
try," which implies by negation that ad- I
vocates of any other policy than Cleve
land's were insane in 1895.
But the Examiner went further than
criticizing the Silverites of the West and
commending President Cleveland's views.
It entered the field of constructive politics
ana boldly advocated that this country's
only escape from the gold basis, in tbe
event of a failure to make an
international agreement, wonld be
free coinage at 25 to 1. On May 4, 1895, it
said: "To maintain parity alone it might
be necessary to make the proportion 25 to j
1. Our experience has not encouraged us I
to believe we couid do this alone at 16
tol."
It might be interesting to know by what
logical processes the silver mine owner
who now conducts two journals favorable
to free coinage at 16 to 1 reached the pre
posterous conclusion that such a course
would save the country and make univer
sal prosperity.
On June 27. 1895, the Examiner put the
case as follows:
"The free coinage of silver under proper
international agreement would help our
trade with all the world, but free coinage
by this country alone, unless it succeeded
in bringing both metals to a parity, wbicb
would hardly be possible, wonld certainly
injure our commerce with countries hav
ing the gold standard. We see the same
effect now in countries that are
on a silver basis. Tbe fl actuations
in the price of silver so disturb inter
national exchange as to make trade be
tween c;old and silver using countries par
take of the nature of a gÂ«mble. All the
profits of a transaction may be wiped out
by a change in the silver market, or, on
tbe other hand, they may be doubled. This
is a discouragement to legitimate com
merce and tend 3to put trade in the bands
of speculators."
If that monometallic silver journal be
lieved free coinage at 18 to 1 would "put
trade in the hunds of speculators" when
It treated the question In 1895, and If it be
lieved the instability of silver would make
trade a gamble, why does it now see the
rainbow of promise in the political hallu
cinations which the wisest men of all
parties now denounce?
Experience has taught me that manufac
tures are at necessary to our independence at
to our comfort The duties we lay on all
articles of foreign manufacture wh\ch prw
dence requires us to establish, at home, with
the patriotic determination of every good
citizen to use no foreign article which can be
made at home, secures us against a relapse
into foreign dependency. My own idea is
that we should encourage home manufactures
to the extent of our own consumption. â
Thomas Jefferson.
OF INTEREST TO WORKINGMEN.
The official figures of the Treasury De
partment for the twenty-four months of
the operation of the Wilson tariff act
ended August 31, 1896, show the expendi
tures of the Government to have been
$104,062,328 more than the income. But
these figures have their greatest value as
indicating the degree of depression which
has prevailed in all lines of trade and in
dustry since the Wilson act became opera
tive. The figures have been received
showing the effect of the Democratic free
trade measure in the industries in July,
1886, as compared with the same month
In 1892.
The report covers 550 plants in thirty
six States and may be accepted as fairly
representing the entire industrial situa
tion. In July, 1892, these 550 plants gave
constant employment to 114,231 hands,
and tbe payroll aggregated $3,927,200 for
the month. Durin pr J uly, 1896, these same
plants gave work to 78,700 hands, with the
payroll aggregating only $2,469,712. These
figures snow not only a decrease in the
force employed, but a decrease in per
capita wages, and the same conditions ob
tain in a greater or less degree throughout
America's industrial world.
This exhibit should be enough to satisfy
every fair-minded wage-earner tbat the
country is very much more in need of
open industries for the unlimited employ
ment of labor than open mints for the
unlimited coinage of silver. And yet
Candidate Bryan sajs a tariff of 10 per
cent tbat is levied to give American labor
an opportunity to earn a good living is as
indefensible as would be a tariff of 1000
per cent. He believes, so he says, that it
is vastly more important that silver mine
owners should have a satisfying market
for their ore than that workingmen should
have opportunity to earn bread and butter.
"J do not recall a time since the days of the
Civil War that there has been so much solici
tude for the rightful outcome of a National
election as in thevear of 1896. AU the people
are reading and studying and informing
themselves in a larger degree than ever before.
Popular inquiry was never so great and popu
lar interest was never so profound. It is
gratifying, too, that the massts of our coun
trymen are seeking the right for the sake
of the right; that they may pursue the right
They want to know only what is best for their
country, what will truly promote their own
welfare and insure the grandest results for
the common good." â McKinley.
WHS THEY TURN TO M'KINLEY.
It was expected that public sentiment
would tarn against Bryanism time enough
before the election to remove all doubt as
to Major McKinley receiving a substantial
majority of the electoral vote, but the
turning began a month ago and It is now
going with a rush. There ire two causes
for this. Major McKinley has been re
ceiving delegations of voters from all parts
of the country, and to each and every one
he has discussed the issues before the
people in a broad, liberal and thoroughly
unsectional way. He has shown that he
is actuated by a sincere desire to help
better the conditions under which our
people live. He talks like a patriot who !
holds all the people and their interests in i
high esteem, and whose only thought is
the good of his fellow-citizens. He never
talks politics, but bis theme is the pros
perity of the people. The people have
watched Major McKinley and they nave
read every one of his speeches.- They have
come to like him for the singleness of his
purpose and his . lofty Americanism.
They see in him the manliest of men, and
they are turning to him without reference
to party ties because they believe they
need him at the head of the Government.
He grows in the confidence and in the
esteem of the people as few men do.
The other cause of the people turning to
Major McKinley to lead them to a stronger
commercial position, that they may have
that degree' of prosperity to which the
natural resources of the country and
their energy entitle them, is the threats
which Bryan makes daily against the very
basic principles of the Government itself
and his desperate effort* to set class i
against class and neighbor against neigh- j
bor. The people see that Bryan is one of the j
most intolerant of men; that he regards \
all who are not for him. as his personal
enemies; that every State voting against
his theories he looks upon as an enemy of
every one of his followers, and that he
thinks his election so essential that 'the'
end justifies any mean* 'that he may
choose to employ. The people see that he
is not only a fanatic, but a fanatic whose
ambition would involve the country in
most alarming situations both at home
and abroad. Indeed, Mr. Bryan has dem
onstrated to the people that one idea
dominates all his thoughts and purpose,
and that idea is Bryan's own importance.
The people, the country, commerce, in
dustry and social life ' appear to ' him as
mere agencies to be employed .to further
his personal aims. These things the peo
ple see in Bryan and they turn away from
iiim because they know a more dangerous
man could not be put at the head of the j
Government.

credits from the European Importers. When
the time lor settlement came around they
could not pay. There nas been stagnation and
plenty of failures.
"They have got what they call Dutch-India
money there. They have the gold standard,
with a silver dollar which is made by the
Chinese from the Mexican dollar. Iv the
Straits they use Mexican silver nnd it fluctu
ates. Three years ago the Mexican dollar
there was worth 75 cents, and when I was
there recently it was worth 50 centa. Now it
is worth about two shillings and two and a
half pence, or something over 50 cents.
"The Dutch dollar in Java is of the samt
size, but is worth the same as gold.
"The principal business place in Java is not
Batavia, the capital, but Sourabaya. This place
has a population of about 200,000, while
Batavia has only about 100,000 people.
"That is a good country to go to, and it is
an interesting one, but till business improve
there will be no pickups or snaps out there for
men who buy or sell. It is close business to
make a dollar."

DIMOND AGAINST
THE NEW CHARTER
The Head of the Buckley
Ticket Declares
Himself.
DEMOCRATIC DRY ROT.
Rich Silverites Take Almost
Complete Charge of the Dem
ocratic Campaign.
HIRE HALLS FOR STEVE WHITE.
A Remarkable Apathy Characterizes
the State Campaign Work of
tbe Democracy.
Joseph I. Dimond, tbe candidate of the
Buckley wing of the Democracy for
Mayor, declared himself last night.
He declared that he was in tbe fight to
stay and to win, and be declared himself
opposed to the new charter.
The candidates on the ticket beld a
private meefng at the Ellis-street head
quarters last night to discuss private affairs
and party policy, and after the meetina
Mr. Dimond, who attended, submitted
readily to a brief interview.
"I know," he said, "that many people
have expressed doubts that I would make
the race, but they are mistaken. I did
not eeek the nomination and I refused it
when it wasfirat tendered me, but since it
was tendered me in this complimentary
manner I bave accepted It and I am de
cidedly in the fight to stay and to win.
"I have not given a pledge to anybody,
except if elected I would try to give this
City the best government possible and to
work for the best interests of the City.
This was the only pledge asked of me,
and if I am elected I shall assume tbe
ofiice absolutely untrammeled.
"My position expresses my decided
opinion as to who constitute the regular
Democratic party of San Francisco."
When asked for his views on the charter
Mr. Diraond said: "I am against the char
ter, and I say it without hesitancy. In
this I speak only for myself personally
and not lor the party.
"I think that under the new charter an
ambitious politician who secured tne of
fice of Mayor could and would use it to
Derpetuate himself ana his friends in
power."
The Buckley ites deny emphatically tbat
Frank J. Murasky, whom they nominated
for Superior Judge, ever filed his resigna
tion with the committee, as was stated in
the Rainey convention night before last
by Joseph E. O'Donnell, when Murasky
succeeded in getting the nomination there.
They say that was a fake in Mnrasky's
interest, and that now they will kick
Murasky off their ticket.
Dr. W. J. Gavigan, who is a member of
tbe Junta campaign committee, but who
was nominated for Police Judge by the
Buckleyites, has been told that he can
have the Rainey nomination tonight if
he will resign Jrom the Buckle}' ticket,
but be has scorned to do so.
Harry I. Mulcreevy of the Thirty-sev
enth District, who was ordered off the
Junta ticket night before last by tbe
Rainey convention, was defiantly renomi
nated by the district convention for the
Assembly last night, and he still has tne
nomination of both wings.
To-day he will file his certificate of nom
ination and then he will snap bis fingers
at the Rainey convention, as those Con
gressional candidates did at tbe fusion
committee.
The Rainey convention will to-night
nominate Police Judges, Justices of the
Peace, a Superintendent of Schools for the
nnexpired term and possibly School Di
rectors.
J. H. Simmons of the Boys' High
School, who was turned down by the last
municipal convention, will probably be
nominated lor Superintendent of Schools.
Tne delegation of the Tbirty- fourth
District last night warmly indorsed J. D.
(jiillin, who was in the Pond Board of
Supervisors, for that nomination in the
Eleventh Ward.
Sam Rainey made a trip to Warm
Springs yesterday to think over his ticket
for Supervisors.
SILVER MINERS RULE.
They Have Taken Entire Charge of
the Democratic State Cam
paign.
J. J. Dwyer, member from California
of the National Democratic Committee,
will be the principal speaker at Metro
politan Hall to-night at a mass-meeting
arranged, advertised and held at the ex
pense and nnder the direction of the Cali
fornia Silver campaign committee,
through the efforts of Chairman W. P.
Lawlor.
This ia interesting chiefly as typifying
the fact that tbe Popocratic campaign in
this State in the interest of Bryan, free
silver and anarchy is being almost wholly
conducted by tbe millionaire silver
miners, and as illustrating the remarkable
apathy that characterizes the State cam
paign of the Democracy.
On the word of many ancient Demo
cratic campaigners the present Democratic
campaign is the most listless, fruitless and
unconsequentlal one in the party history
of the State.
The lirst reason is tbe remarkable lack
of interest throughout the party and the
second of the leading reasons is the fac
tional dissensions in the party and th*
present factional control of the machine
by a few scheming and ambitious poli
ticians.
The State Democratic machine is so im
potent through lack of party interest,
party unity and co-operation and funds,
and is so badly afflicted witn dry rot that
the actual work as well as the expense of
the campaign has been turned over to the
millionaire miners who run and liberally
put up for the silver party's machine.
Tbe Silverites haye money. They have
lots of it. Charles D. Lane, millionaire,
has taken a sip from the seductive foun
tain of politics and he has opened his
eyes with the thrill and felt the swell of
ambition within, as so many Western
millionaire miners have done before.
Lane asked the Pops with a generous wave
of his hand to take a whole PnlJman
sleeper with him, and Lane will dash off a
thousand-dollar check any day to help
the cause â and himself. There is Al
vinza Hay ward, the Fair estate and a lot
of other wealth Dehind the Silverites.
And there's the Southern Pacific Com
pany which has George W, Baker, John
W. Mitchell and others of its representa
tives at the helm of the Silver party.
The headquarters of the Democratic
campaign are only nominally at the Cali
fornia Hotel. They are realiyin the Bald
win annex. They are magnificent head
quarters. They have extent and luxury
and some life. A long series of bis rooms,
finely carpeted and furnished, which were
long occupied by a big gambling club,
compose the headquarters.
There are no Btgns of poverty in tbe
looks of things or in tbe way things are
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, ' SEPTEMBER 23, 1896.
done, and there is a fine mahogany side
board supplied with the best and a
colored steward.
Well, the silverites have paid for and
arranged nearly all the meetings the
Democrats bave been able to hold to far.
There have been but two nia-s-meetinKS
in this City during the campaign under
the announced auspices of tbÂ« Democratic
State Central Committee and these were
paid for by the Iroquois Ciub.
The millionaire silver miners are even
paying for the nias?-meetiiigs of the Demo
cratio Kational Comruitteemun. They
bave arranged and paid tbe expense of all
the meetings in this City and vicinity for
Steve White, the Democratic Senator.
They are similarly paying the main ex
penses of the chief Populist speakers.
Chairman W. P. lawlor, who helped put
activity into tbe last Democratic campaign,
has arranged several series of meetings,
and, having plenty of money to spend, has
even taken charge of the Popocratic Con
gressional compaigns.
M. F. Taylor of Colorado is to speak at
San Jose to-night and then on successive
nights at Santa Rosa, Napa, Oakland and
Stockton, and he will probably speak in
the south. The silverites hnve taken
charge of Barlow's campaign in tne Sixth
District and Chairman Lawlor has ar
ranged an itinerary for him lasting until
October 3, embracing 6anta Cruz, Monte
rev and Santa Barbara counties.
The Silverites have hired J. L. York, the
free-thought lecturer, and started him on
a tour of the Sixth District.
M. E. Dittmar, editor of the Redding
Searchlight, is to stump the First, Second
and Third districts for the silver miners,
and somebody is to be sent trailing after
C. F. McClashan through the Second Dis
trict, to fight that stalwart Populist who
would not be fused.
The Silverites are to assr.me the work of
the Democrhticcampaign in San Francisco
so soon as this flurry about local politics
lets up a little, and then Foote, Tarpey,
Deuprey and the rest of the Democratic
orators will beat the service of the silver
miners, and speak at two or three district
meetings a night at the Silverites' expense.
Mr. Lawlor has a lot more itineraries
and speakers about ready in the plenitude
of his resources.
Tbe Bryan literature being distributed
through tbe State is mainly provided by
the silver miners' syndicate which sent
him lecturing through the country a year
ago. The Democratic literary committee
helped to compile a pamphlet of forty
Eages, and quit, work some time ago. The
ilverites had 200,000 copies printed, and
the Democrats agreed to take and pay for
75,000 copies. Charles D. Lane gave the
Democratic State Central Committee $1000,
but bis bright son, Tom Lane, kept it to
pay for those 75,000 copies.
At tbe Democratic State headquarters
the visitor wonders why nobody much is
around, why those who are seem to be in
the dumps, and why in the "heat of the
campaign" there is notbing much going
on. Chairman Alford is always there,
busy. worried and affable, but the "'leaders"
don't drop in mucii, and nobody seems to
be interested or busy or lending a hand.
The Democrats who bave seen the activ
ity, labor and hurrah of former cam
paigns display tlieir disgust in a confi
dential way or say in a fiee-and-easy man
ner, "Oh, well, the Silverites are doing the
work."
The lack of interest in the Democratic
ranks is the chief cause of the lack of
money, which in turn is a cause of lurther
lack of interest. They profess to be proud
of their poverty at headquarters, but in
fact nobody much is interested enough to
give $5 to tbe cause.
"We haven't taken in $1000," said Treas
urer Hassett yesterday.
"Five members of the State Central
Committee have paid that $30 assessment.
The Palmer and Buckner campaign have
taken away one branch of resources. The
Federal employes shrivel into their shells
at the .suggestion of money, and probably
say 'civil service law.'
"The late Supreme Court decision made
a Jot of local patronage people mighty in
dependent. Tbat 'popular appear hasn't
brought in two-bits. The speakers' com
mittee and the iiterary committee haven't
moved lor weeks. The finance committee
met some time apo and decided that It
couldn't do a thing. J. A. Flicher was
going to hold up tbe Govsrnor and his
crew for $1000 and got about $4 40. The
Sacramento people said, 'Great Scott! we
want money from you.' "
So the millionaire silver miner) run the
Democratic campaign.
The rapid rise of the McKinley tide
throughout the State, the enthusiastic co
operation of all classes in the McKinley
campaign, the multiplicity of lively Re
publican ciubs everywhere and the dis
couraging reports that pour in from all
sources help to make tbe woe deeper.
Democratic Aspirants.
One issue that will further differentiate
the candidates of the two wings of the
Democracy will be tbe charter. Mr. I)i
-mond is understood to be against the new
charter and Mr. Phelan for it.
Some of the partisans of James D. Phe
lan yesterday began an effort to make
political machines of the improvement
clubs of the City by getting the Associated
Improvement Clubs to indorse Phelan's
candidacy for Mayor. As these clubs are
composed of citizens of all kinds of polit
ical faith, such a proceeding would tend
to wreck the organizations and its success
is not considered probable.
The Twenty-fifth Senatorial District
will have three Democratic candidates in
the fielri, Senator John Fay beint; in the
field for re-election as an independent.
Fay looked long and hard for the Junta
nomination, but he stood no chance with
the combined opposition of the Daggett-
Rainey-Lanigan forces against him, who
put up John Feeney, an employe in the
Mint. Fay will take his chances against
both the Rainey and the Buckley candi
dates. He is now circulating his petition.
The Palmer Petition.
The petition by which the Sound-Money
Democrats will get the Palmer and Buck
ner electoral ticket on the ballot is grow
ing fast," and yesterday Secretary Eliiott
McAllister stated that about 2000 signa
tures had been reported by the paid can
vassers working in this City alone. Others
are at work in Oakland. Besides these, a
large number of unreported names are on
the petitions which members of the league
are voluntarily working with at their con
venience, and many other petitions are
being circulated by volunteers through
out the State. There will be no trouble in
getting the required 9000 names.

present. The enthusiasm was unabated
and great joy prevailed when a recess was
declared for the purpose of giving E. D.
COUNT DE BEAUREGARD of Paris, Who Is Goin ? to Htmt
Antelopes on the Deserts of Arizona and New Mexico,
[Sketched from life by a ''Call " artist.]
Sawyer, the nominee for Superior Judge,
an opportunity to appear before the ael
egates and indorse the platform and say
some words of encouragement for the
ticket and tbe principles contained in the
declaration thereof.
The Judge's remarks were received with
rounds of applause by the delegates, who
were much gratified at his remarks.
Another cause of rejoicing was when
| General \V. H. H. Hart, who was defeated
in the convention for the office of Mayor
as against Supervisor C. L. Taylor, in
forraed thÂ« delegates that "'should" Mr.
Taylor decline the nomination he would
most cheerfully accept It and make a
successful winning. ,

vention settled down to business and as
a concession to the bicycle associations,
j which have representatives in the body,
nominated for Btreet Superintendent
George P. Wetrnore, contractor of concrete
and art stone work at 216 Valencia street,
with residence at 441 Golden Gate avenue.
Robert Munch, Mayor Sutro's engineer
received the nomination for Surveyor on
the second ballot, as against ex-Surveyor-
General H. 1. Willey. '
The first ballot stood 61 to 61, but on the

of a majority.
This victory brought great joy to the
supporters of the Teutonic nominee's
friends, as it is expected to bring him the
German vote.
For the Assembly M. E. Irwin of the
Thirtieth, A. N. Morpan of the Thirtv

be the most worthy for the place. A like i

It is expected shat the convention will

who are without homes. There are offered
plainly furnished, comfortable rooms at
nominal cost and such as room there can
obtain meals at the Young Women's
Christian Association at 1 cent a dish.
The home receives girls who are arrested
for minor offenses. It educates them,
teaches them useful occupations and finds
places for them, keeping a supervisory
watch over them, and in that way has
been doing much Rood.
An interesting programme was rendered

BEARS, GATORS, TIGERS
The Great Count de Beauregard
Tells of His Quest for
Big Game.
Some Thrilling Experiences in Canada,
Cuba and the Mountains of
Vera Cruz.
The Count de rseauregard, the giant
nobleman of France, who has arrived at
the Palace Hotel, is the theme of much
talk among the guests U ere. He \n a mag
nificent specimen of young manhood, be
sides he is traveled, debonaire and a great
hunter.
He has been away at St. Johns Lake,
in Quebec, on the trail of bears, and fish
ing in the lake for the gamy land-locked
salmon, known there as the winanish.
The Count and his associates put in a week
there fishing and enjoying themselves in
divers ways.
"It was seven days of as unalloyed hap
piness as I ever experienced anywhere,"
said the Count lo a Call representative
yesterday. "In the seven days we caught
115 magnificent salmon, the average
weight of each being about four or tive
pounds. They were not so very big, but
these fish are very gamy. My partner
caught one, for instance, and he jumped
so much that he jumped right into the
canoe. I hud one fish myself tbat jumped
no less than thirteen times. I have
bunted and fished all over tbe conntry,
but I never found a pJace where the lisa
were so gamy as in tbat lake. They're
beautifully colored, too.
"The bears we got there were the brown
and cinnamon bears of that cou.itry. We
saw no grizzlies. We didn't bave time to
go very far into the forests. One bear that
we shot there â a big fellow â managed to
get away from vÂ«. How seriously tie was
wounded I don't Know, but at any rate we
couldn't find him. Prior to going to
Canada I was down in Cuba ana hunted
considerably down there. There are a
great many ducks there, and hunting
these ducks is line sport. Hut a far liner
sport is hunting the alligator. I had a lot
of experience at this and had a magnifi
cent time. I killed three alligator;. I
suppose I'm not entitled to any particular
credit for killing them, because you know
anybody can kill alligators. Still, it'a a
fine sport; a good deal of spice about it.
"I saw a great many interesting things
in Cuba while I was there. While I was
in port there was a big ship there loaded
down with 1600 rebel prisoners. Over in
Morro Castle there was a lot more. If you
get In there you stay forever. There it no
such tli ing as getting out.
"I had intended when in Mexico, where
I was for some time, to bave a try at tbe
Mexican tigers. But it v.as raining and
the roads were rough. My horse sank up
to his middle. I'm pretty heavy, of course,
and it would be expected that a horse
I would go down some in muddy roads,
but these roads in Mexico discount any
thing on the earth tbat I ever saw before.
However, I had some pretty good hunting
experiences there. I was in the moun
tains of Vera Cruz and killed quite a lot of
game indigenous to that section. Tbe
game included the vari-colored birds and
tbe small animals tbat inhabit the moun
tains of that tropical country.
"On my way here ov<Â»r the Southern
Pacific Railroad I saw in Naw Mexico and
Arizona large bands of antelope. They
were a beautiful sight as they moved
hither and thither over the great stretches
of undulating prairie. I was so much
fascinated with mem that I tbink I will
go back there and bunt them for a time,
then I will go to New York, where I am
called by business, after which I hope to
come back here and proceed on a tour
around the world. I wanted to go direct
from San Francisco, but this business
matter of mine causes ma to add 10,000
miies more to ray trip."
John D. Bliss of New Yoric is traveling
with Count de Beauregard. Thd gentle
men were around town yesterday seeing
the sights. They intend visiting the park,
Presidio and some of the suburban places
before setting out to hunt the antelope.

A TALE FROM THE SEA.
Harry Rose Says He Was Bound,
Gagged, Blindfolded and
Shanghaied.
He Made His Escape in a Boat in
Mid-Ocean With the Assistance
of a Waiter.
For the past three or four days Detec
tive Harry Reynolds has been hunting
around the water front in quest of a
Mexican bark manned by piratical-look
ing men, but has given up the search as
hopeless.
It was all caused by a story that Harry
Rose told and which has proved that
Harry is blessed with an extraordinarily
powerful imagination. Still he declares
tbat every word is true.
Harry is 15 years of age and stands 5
feet 10 inches in his shoes. He is em
ployed in tbe Fulton Iron Works and a
week ago last Monday he left his uncle's
house, 914^ Devisadero street, to go to
work, but ne did not reach there. His
disappearance was reported to the police
and to the joy of his uncle he returned
home last Friday night. To account for
hia disappearance he told a thrilling story,
which he afterward repeated to the police.
He said while on his way to the iron
works he met a man who gave him $2 and
induced him to go to a room in some
place he did not know. There he was
bound, gagged and blindfolded and at
night was taken in a Hack to the water
front. He was put in a small boat and
rowed out to a vessel. They boarded the
vessel and be was put in the forecasts
after the handkerchief had been removed
from his eyes. He saw a lot of men with
swarthy faces and black whiskers and
over the entrance to the forecastle was a
Mexican namo in gold letters beginning
with the letter "Q."
They pulled up anchor and sailed away.
Harry felt sick and he asked a waiter who
served him with coffee In tbe forecastle to
save him. He gave the waiter $2 and at 2
o'clock next mornintr, while the vessel
was anchored in mid-ocean ana two men

Mr. O'Brien Suggests a Danger to
American Workingmen and
Dwells on Protection.
There have been many good audiences
in the Auditorium, but not one of them
was larger or more intelligent or enthusi
astic than the audience which assembled
last night. It wai one of the largest be
cause many hundreds of late comers were
enable to gain an entrance. It was also
one of the most intelligent audiences that
ever assembled at any political meeting in
this State, and the spontaneous and long
continued outbursts of cheering showed
that no audience could have been more
enthusiastic.
The fair sex lent its presence in goodly
numbers in tbe galleries and applauded as
liberally as did the men.
The meeting was opened by Chairman
Charles M. Shortridge, who made a brief
speech, in the course of which he said that
he had made a pledge here not long ago
which be desired to repeat, and that was
tn at he pledged the people of this State
that if San Francisco, bis adopted City,
did not give its vote for McKinley he
would undertake, by way of penalty,
although not a swimmer or an athlete, to
swim from tbe foot of Market street to
Goat Island on the 4th of November. But
he believed that it would bs much harder
for the Democratic party to swim out of
the sea of despondency into which it will
have Deen plunged.
Chairman Shortridge then introduced
Thomas B. O'Brien, nominee for Congress
from the Fourth District. Mr. O'Brien
made a brief but logical and convincing
argument on the necessity for protecting
American industries. He taxed his oppo
nent with having done nothing for his
district in the past four years, and pointed
out the fact that Sacramento and San
Jose were enjoying their new postofiices,
while San Francisco had nothing but tlie
site full of Democratic anger-holes. His
opponent had been an advocrate of free
trade, wnich had opened up British mills
and factories and closed American hives
of industry.
Mr. O'Brien followed by complimenting
Iriisn-American citizens on their loyalty
to the land of their adoption. With re
gard to the Democratic flourish of trum
pets on the railroad funding bill, he aaid
that the Republicans of California had
proclaimed themselves in their last State
platform in favor of compelling the rail
road corporations to pay their debts to the
Government in tbe same manner as every
man who owes it a dollar.
Mr. O'Brien was frequently interrupted
\utb rounds of applause, and left an ex
cellent impression on his hearers.
Miss Ella Ellis, one of the sweetest sing
ers at Republican meetings daring this
campaign, entertained the audience with
topical songs.
Colonel Kowalsky began as follows:
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen and
Fellow-citizens: The momentous question is,
Do you want the mines of the world openea
for the millionaires of the world? or, Do you
want the factories of America opened for the
millions of laboring men of America?
Do you want tree trade, free silver, dishonor
and uuhappiness? or, Do you want protection,
honest money, prosperity and happiness ?
Answer with your votes in November, and
tell with no uncertain voice the loyal people
in every other part of America that California
is in line for the Naiion, having done her duty
in sustaining the banner ol protection, giving
reverence to the memory of the late beloved
James G. Blame and likewise honoring the
living apostle of this great principle, the Hon
William McKinley of Ohio.
After charging that tbe Democracy was
a failure on financial matters the speaker
said:
As loud as any other man In the Democratic
party at that time to insure prosperity
through the medium of free trade was the
voice of William J. Bryan, the Democratic-
Populistic Wateon-Sewall candidate for the
Presidency. Four years ago he promised with
all the earnestness of his nature and all the
eloquence of his speech to give to tne great
American people better prices for their crops
more wages tor their daily labor and a general
glow of prosperity to the entire country, if the
Democratic party were permitted to carry out
the doctrines of free trade; and If the ultra-
Democratic members of the Democratic Con
gress that passed the Gorman-Wilson bill had
been in full sway and conld have controlled to
the full limit of their wishes, in place of hard
times from which we are now suffering we
would be in a state verging on ruin to-day.
The few sensible and conservative Demo
crats who live in a country where protection
is absolutely necessary, and whose constitu
ents insisted that the products raised and
the articles manufactured by them must be
protected, together with the Republicans who
were members of the House of Representa
tives, as well as of the Senate, stoou by and
forced at least some concession in the interest
of American products and American labor
Imagine, it you can, how much more ter
rible the whole situation would have been if
they had exercised to the very limit, in all of
Us intentions, the doctrine of free trade Let
me show you a picture: Come with me to Bir
mingham, Manchester and the othe" great
manufacturing cities of England. Eight years
agoâ yes, even four years ago. their factories
were closed, their capital was unemployed and
their workingmen at home.
Come bacic to this, our own dear country at
the same period of time: Go down through
the valleys of Perms Ivania, along the Hud
â¢on.in New York, and through the spindle
factories in New England. See tlie smoke
from those chimneys and the lights of the mr
uaces, making night seem almost like day
and tbe hum of the spindle and the sound of
the anvil can be heard to ring unceasingly
from early morn until late at night. Every
one of our people employed at good wnges
the product of their labor being consumed
here at home, sold at a price that makes it
possible for the manufacturer to earn a profit
and to give to his workingmen a lik*. profit
to the producer of the raw material a fair
profit; the consumer able to pay a reasonable
price, because that which he doesâ the occu
pation in which he is engagedâ is equally lu
crative, and he la aDle to give a part of the
profit which he earns to hirfellow-mau-to the
man wbo produced the raw material to the
man who invested his capital, to each and
every one of his fellow-citizens who, like him
self, are toilers, and make up a part of the
great commonwealth. There was asingular and
peculiar reciprocity of prosperity between
them.
What is the difference to-day? The warning
that went forth from the throats of the patri
otic Republicans who sought to stem and stay
this awful condition was unheeded It was
thought there must bo some truth in the sr>len
did promises made by the Democratic partyâ
promises which fairly illuminated the skips
with their brilliancy. The great American
peopleâ those who voted with the Democratic
party, and the woikingmen particularlyâ said
It was impossible for a party made up of great
men, for a party made up of men of education
and of brains to be so absolutely mistaken as
they have proved themselves, they could not
believe that the Democratic party was telling
and promising that of which no part could be
carried out ; and when they were told that
they woula be the sufferers, that the working
cusses of the country would suffer, that this
thing wasdirected at them, that ihe rich httd
nothing to lose, that It was the poor man who
COLONEL HENRY L KOWALSKY, Who Made a Telling Speech
at the Auditorium Last Night.
would receive the thrust, the same arguments,
the same kind of promises were renewed to
the workingmen until they were lured away.
And I ask you, my iellow-citizens, who has
received the blowâ upon whom has it fallen
most severely? The workingman can answer
thisâ he, his wife and his children are the
sufferers. The rich can live anyhow; the rich
can live on what they have laid by; the rich
can draw from their stores. The poor man has
to earn his sustenance, day by day; and when
he does not labor he does not carry home food
to the wife and to the children who are wait
ing there for it.
And now we are confronted with another
pictureâ the result of the. broken promise* of
the Democratic party. Let us look once again
at Manchester, Birmingham and all tiie other
manufacturing cities of England. Let us
traverse Germany and France. There we find
that the furnaces which were silent, the chim
neys which were smokeless, the spindie which
was falling apart from nonuse are again in
action. Their furnaces are burning; their
chimneys are giving for'h the ligut that is
making nieht as day. They are prosperous
and are growing rlcn. The workingmen of
England, of Germany, of Scotland and of all
the other countries lying within that greatand
broad land where labor is cheap and plentiful
are now employed.
And who are "their customers â for whom are
they laboring to-day? They are working every
moment for the American peojile; they are
working for the workingmen of America:' they
are working for the midille classes vi America ;
they are working for tiie rich of America; they
are doing our work, while our factories are idle,
our furnaces are cold, our spindles are itilJ
and our workincmen are out upon the high
way, and we can hear their murmur and their
cry for bread.
Ten millions of people without work!
Ask the Democratic pary why; ask William
J. Bryan why; yes, ask this Democratic-Popu
listic-Silverlte if this is what he calls a redemp
tion of a promise; ask him if this is what he
calls good faith; ask him if he expects you to
believe In him again 1 Ask yourselves, with
this experience in the past, can you dare to
believe him in the future? Forgot, if your
hunger will permit you, to consider the rem
edy he offers you for the mistake he has made.
Let us look at the perscription which tills in
competent doctor ventures lor our now im
poverished and weak frame: "Free and un
limited coinage of silver at a ratio of 1(3 to 1,"
which means when analyzed, the open
ing of the mints of the United States of
America to the silver of the whole world, irre
spective of the place whence it comes; the
silver product of Mexico, dug from the bowels
of Mexico with 30 cents a day labor; from
South America, with labor at 15 cents a
day; and from all over the world. The mints
of America, maintained by the workmen of
America, maintained by the middle classes of
America, mainlined by the rich of America,
the American taxes, levied upon the American
people, are to maintain mints to com every
body's silver into American dollarsâ into
American dollars only in name, and not in
valueâ a dollar only in pretense; the worst
kind of a dollar, the poorest kind of a dollarâ a
dollar worth 47 cents less than a genuine gold
dollar!
After showing some of the commercial
and natural absurdities of the single silver
standard plan the colonel went on to ex
plain about tbe ratio.
To-day in tbe market the ratio is more than
31 of silver to 1 of gold. That is why th 9
HON. THOMAS B. O'BRIEN, Republican Nominee for Congress
man in the Fourth Congressional District.
silver dollar of Mexico is only worth 50 cents
in gold in America. Now that it is more than
v i s wor:h or -b' half the price. Yet
the silver-mine owner insists that he only
ought to be made to (five 68 ceu is worth of
silver in Dlace of a full dollar's worth fora
dollar. Is this honest? Is this fair? Does
the Government protect your commodity,
your labor, with a guaranteed proiit of 47
cents on each dollar? ]f n does not why then
should this preference be given to the silver
mine owner?
Naturally you ask: "Why Is our present sil
ver dollar possessed of the purchasing power
that the gold dollar is possessed of?"
The answer Is simple M nd plain: It is be
cause, first, you can take five of our silver dol
lars to tne United States treasury and eet a
five-dollar gold piece for them, fhe Govern
ment is behind our silver doliar under our
present system, and the way our Government
is able to make good the difference between
the value that is contained in the silver dollar
ana the lack of value to make i; a dollar is be
cause there is behind the Government the gold
to redeem with. If the Government had aoth
ing but itselfâ no go d with which to take up
the silverâ you would very goon find silver
tumbling over, and the American dollar would
not be worth any more than the Mexican dol

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1896.
lars in this country lust the same aa they have
in Mexico.
On this proposition the speaker paid his
respects to the silver millionaires â the
Haywards, the Newlands, the Stewarts,
the Joneses, and the others who are at the
bottom of this agitation.
The colonel's speech was a fine and well
studied effort, and would occupy eight
columns of Thk Cas-l in small type.
Mrs. Addie L. Ballou followed with a
few witty remarks, after which the meet
ing adjourned.
THE END IS AT HAND.
The Marceau Suit Said to Be
Neariiig a Compro
mise.
Necessary Papers in the Case Are
to Be Filed in a Day
or So.
It is understood that a settlement of the
Marceau case is near. The cash is at
hand and all dirlicultiea have been ad
justed.
Theo Marcenu sued for $106,000, the
amount he claimed was owed to him, and
a divorce.
The case has dragged wearily along
since the last ot September, 1895, for it was
in that month that Mrs. Marceau de
serted him. Soon after the separation
Mr. Marceau by the aid of a nurse stole
one of the children, which Mrs. Mar
ceau obtained again by legai proceedings.
Since then the case has assumed a very
bitter turn, and promised to last longer
than now appear*.
It seems now that all the difficulty has
been adjusted, and that papers have been
signed entirely vindicating Mrs. Marceau.
The $106,000 thp.t Mr. Marceau sued for in
the beginning has been cut down to $30,000
by compromise, which appears to bd a
very advantapeous one for Mrs. Marceau,
who had to mortgage her Fisk property
and the Allen block in Fresno to obtain
the cash.
As the case now stands Mr. Neville and
Judge Short have loaned the money to
Mrs. Marceau, ami the case will be settled
to-morrow, or at least in a few days. Mr.
Marceau was ordered by tbe court to pay
Mrs. Marceau $10 a day alimony, but it
appears that up to date Mr. Marceau has
only paid into her hands $300, which went
in settlement for rent of a residence she
then occupied.
Just before that time Mr. Campbell had
loaned her $800 to satisfy the demands of
certain creditors, and for which Mrs. Mar
ceau gave a wedding present as a pledge.
The mutual friends of both Mr. and Mrs.
Marceau are very anxious that a settle
ment occur as soon as possible, and they
aver that such a settlement is soon to
take pl-ice.
The papers in the case will be filed to
dny or to-morrow.

DECAPITATED BY
A STREETCAR
Burglars Interrupted in
Their Early Morning
Work.
HATES-STREET CAR 207
Catches a Telephone Wire and
Cuts Off a Lamppost's
Head.
A CBIME WAS PREVENTED.
Early Morning Roof and Porch C imb
ers Who Were Fjiled by the
Detective Cable-Car.
A cable-car, in the role of a detective, is
somethine out ol the ordinary. Yet there
is such a car running on the Market-street
system, and until yesterday morning this
fact was unknown.
It is car 207 on the Hayes-street line, it
is one of the only cars in tde entire service
that has not, at some time or other, run
over come infant or winged an adult.
This particular car, quite evidently, has
been silently bent on doing work in an
other way, protecting life and property
instead of sacrificing the one and allowing
the other to be despoiled.
It was on tbe down trip â meaning east
wardâon Hayes street, shortly after 5:30
o'clock yesterday morning, that car 207
"showed its hand," as parlance goes. On
the down grade between Buchanan and
Laguna streets it encountered a swaying
telephone wire reaching from the roof of
615 over to the other side at 624.
The wires caught in the roof of the car,
where the ventilators are located, and by
it was dragged along down grade like a
bull would plunge away with a riata.
As the wire became taut on the port
side it caught up the lamp of one of the
very few gas company's posts in that
neighborhood. The tension was so great
that the lamp flew off and hung limp on
its post, and the wire was carried on a
dozen feet more before it snapped under
the superior power of the cable and the
detective car.
Without details as to the fright of the
passengers who were rudely awakened by
a succession of jolts and jerks from the
semi-somnolent state following the recent
exit from a pleasant couch, the detective
feature of car 207 may be briefly gone into.
Unlike the members of Captain Lees'
so-called "upper office," who await the
commission of a crime and then try to
arrest tfie criminal, with frequent mis
carriage of result, the car broke right in
on one or more burglars, routed him or
them in short order and went its way.
The report of the affair was made at
headquarters before noon yeÂ«tÂ«rday, and
an investigation followed, resulting In the
disclosure of a plan to rob the house at
617, on the south side of Hayes street.
There is every indication on tbe roof of
the building â a two-story modern house â
that one or more persona had reached the
roof by means of the ladder in the rear of
the water-tank. The supposition is that
the burglar, in lowering himself to the
front porch so as to gain admission to the
second story through the hallroom win
dow, broke the telephone wire from its
insulator, and it hung in a loop across the
street. The wire originally was strung
east and west from 615 to 617 and thence
across to6J4, and the sagging allowed it to
hanc just low enough to be caught by the
roof of the detective-car.
"There was no robbery or burglary on
the premises," Captain lÂ«ees said yester
day. "A wire caught in the car and broke
a lamp-light, that's all."
Captain Lees, however, has a number of
his best men out scouring Hayes Valley
and the Richmond district, where bur
glaries have recently been numerous and
undetected.

make him realize that he is not what he
was. Youthful excesses bring their fruit,
and what ought to be vigorous manhood
at sixty is old age and debility. Vitality
wasted in youth is missed at forty and
mourned at fifty. .
Old men who find themselves weak in
vitality, especially in sexual force, con-
clude that it is but the natural result of
old age. This is not always true. While
there is a physical constitution there
should be good sexual vigor. Dr. San-

men to vigorous manhood. Here is one :

you are manufacturing an article that is of
incalculable benefit to mankind. I cheerfully
recommend your Belt for the renewal of vital,

I was fast losing my vitality and strength, but
I got one of your belts at that time and I have
since then been a new man. lam 62 years of

remedy for rejuvenating old age. I feel ten
years younger since I got your Belt. I cheer-

The Oregon's Boat Went

AN UNEaHAL CONTEST.
Who Was to Blame Remains to
Be Seenâ An Investigation
in Order.
SPEED OF THE EOYAL FOETH.
Made the Passage From Fifty to
Fifty in the Record of Eleven
Days.
Several of Uncle Barn's men had a nar
row escape yesterday. They were on
their way in the provision-boat for the
line-of-battle ship Oregon, when the river
steamer Alvira with a barge in tow, came
along and ran them down. No lives were
lost, but the boat and provisions went to
the bottom of the bay.
The Oregon's launch was on its way to
the warship and the Alvira, with the
barge Orient in tow, was on her way to the
Mission mud flats. The man-of-warsmen
thought they could pass in front of the
river steamer and found out their mistake
too late. Before the boat in tow of the
launch could get out of the way the barge
Orient was on top of it and everything went
out of sight. Two of the men were picked
up by Henry Peterson in the launch Amy,
and Captain Leale of the Caroline picked
up another. The latter boat did a smart
piece of work, and had a boat in the water
and on the scene three minutes after the
accident. The cook on the Aivira threw a
life-buoy with such precision that it en

matters he is interested in in Hawaii are
straightened out be will return to San
Francisco to fight any attempt Winthrop's
attorneys may make for a new trial.
Among the arrivals yesterday were the
D.nsdale, 152 days from Hamburg, the
Esernplo-e, 192 days from Genoa, and the
Royal Forth, 137 days from Swansea.
The latter made the run from 50 to 50
in eleven days, thns making one of
the best of records. The entire trip was
a favorable one, but light winds in the
Pacific prevented a record-breafcing run.
The ships Formosa, John Cook. Heliens
bnrgh and Star of France all sai.ed for
Europe this morning. There is. a rush to
get wheat into England at present, and an
excitins race is anticipated.
A runaway on the water front caused
considerable excitement at the ferries yes
terday. A horse was left unhitched and
with headstall off. While mucning his
oats he took fright and ran away. He
made direct for the crowd that was com
ing of! the Oakland steamer and many
people would have been trampled under
foot had not Sergeant Jack Hayes of
the State Harbor Police rushed
in and secured the animal. He was
badly bruised in the fight, but his
weight told and he brougnt the frantic
animal to a standstill. Sergeants Maboney
and Hayes are very wroth with the drivers
of the mail- wagons. On a number of oc
casions when awaiting the arrival of a
steamer with mail aboard the men have
fed their horses and Incidentally left them
unhitched. The animals proceeded to run
away and the policemen were given a
chase.
News by the Doric is to the effect that
the damage to the Gaelic was greater than
at first anticipated. About forty plates,
nine frames and three bulkheads will re
quire renewal, and as the mainmast was
knocked ont of its step it also will have to
be fixed. It will be a couple of months
before the repairs to the steamer are fairly
under way, as a survey will have to be
held at Hongkong.

â William 'Whelan Literally Ground to
Pieces by a Southern Pacific
Engine. â 
William Whelan, employed as a night
watchman at the Southern Pacific yards
at Fourth and Townsend Ptreets, met with
a horrible death yesterday morning. He
was literally ground to pieces by engine
1017, the body being scattered for several
yards along the track.
Just when or how the accident happened
no one seemed to know. Wbelan was to
have reported for duty earlier in the even
ing, but instead employed his time in get
ting drunk. It is supposed that he wan
dered into the yard about midnight and
went to sleep on the tract. Engineer Ed
ward Saunders in charge of engine 1017
did not know of the accident until in
formed by W. T. Hines, who found the
body.
Whelan was paid off Monday afternoon.
Shortly after 7 o'clock he ieit home in
tending to pay rome bills ana later to re
port for duty. His wife never saw him
alive again. No blame whatever is at
tached to Engineer Saunders for the acci
dent.

The Adjtitant-General United states Aimy,
WaÂ»hingt,n, D. C: In view of the lact that tue
Fi!th Artillery has served nine and a half years
on Southern stations since 1865, during which
period the First Artillery has served there only
three years, and in justice to the officers and
enlisted rcen of my regiment, I most respect
fully appeal to the honorab.e Secretary of War
to reconsider the order which sends them to
serve another tour in that climate, while the
First Artillery will still have only served one
tour there. This telegram is forwarded direct
with the permission of the department com
mander.
Graham, Commanding Regiment.
Senator Perkins has been informed of
the order transf^rrine the Fifth Artillery
from this station to Florida and may join
in an appeal to the Secretary of War to
have the orderjrevoked or at least snspend
ed|tor a period.
General Ruger, commanding the De
partment of the East, has wired General
Graham to ascertain the latter'a pleasure
concerning the two batteries to be assigned
to regimental headquarters, St. Augustine,
General Graham in his reply designated
Battery A, Captain Benjamin; X, Roberts,
and Battery Â£ Captain Eibridge R. Hills.
Should General Ruger follow the order
observed in the present assignment of the
batteries of the Third Artillery in the
South Lieulenant-Colone! Sinclair will go
to Barrancas. The three nrnjors will go
respectively to Su Augustine. New Orleans
and Key West. It is understood that
Major Kinzil, the junior major, will be
BtationeJ at St. Augusiine; Major McCrea,
the beniur major, may elect to go to Jack
son Barracks, New Orleans, as General
Ruger may assign him, there. General
Ruger may, however, choose to tend

WILLIAMS IS SENTENCED
Six Years, and a Fine of Ten
Thousand Dollars
Added.
Exhaustive Review of the Motion
of Denftndant's Council for a
New Tria'.
The sensational indictment, dismissal
from the service and final conviction of
Dick Williams terminated yesterday when
Judge Morrow sentenced him to Bix years
in San Quentin, 'with a fine of $10,000
thrown in as a kind of sauce.
Williams received the full penalty of
the lawâ three years and $5000 on each in
dictment. The convicted man listened to
the sentence with apparent unconcern.
When court opened Williams appeared
to be in fine spirits. There were a goodly
number of spectators present, including
many Custom-house employes.
As had been expected, Judge Morrow's
decision op the motion of Attorney Col
lins for a stay of proceedings and a new
trial was a lengthy affair, nearly two
hours being consumed in its delivery.
Clearly and concisely eyery point in the
celebrated case was gone into, some of the
authorities quoted being from English
courts of earlier days.
The principal point Involved In the ap
plication for a new trial was the introduc
tion by the prosecution of an affidavit
made by Williams in the suit for divorce
instituted in the civil courts by his wife.
It was through this affidavit that the pros
ecution was finally enabled to introduce
Williams' bankbook, showing that he had
deposited $4750 within the abort period of
three months.
Judge Morrow held that the affidavit
was a voluntary admission "not ob
tained by means of a judicial proceeding."
as the defendant was not compelled to
disclose his personal affairs. The conten
tion, therefore, that evidence had been
wrongfully admitted was incorrect An
other point made by de tend ant's counsel
was that Williams bad been tried under a
statute pertaining to revenue officials and
not to employes ot the Custom-house.
His Honor held there was no such term
as "Cninese Inspector of the Custom
house." Williams legally was an officer
of the Treasury Department, and merely
designated as a Chinese inspector. The
statute applied, therefore, to customs
officials as well as those employed in the
revenue office.
This practically terminates the most
famous Federal scandal since the Ciprico-
Boyd conspiracy of some years ago.
it is understood that Williams' attorney
will take an appeal to the United States
Supreme Court. In the meantime Mr.
Collins will make a great effort to secure
his client's release on bail.
Williams expressed himtelf at the
County Jail yesterday as confident of be
ing ultimately acquitted. He declared also
that he would never go to San Quentin,
even for a day- He characterized the trial
as a farce, and that he was now suffering
for the faults of other.
Death Dae to Accident.
An Inquest was held yesterday on the death
of Achllie Waldteufel, the Market-street book
dealer, who was lound dead In his room, 414
Van Ness avenue, on the morning; of Septem
ber 17. Joseph A. and Emile Waldteufel, sons
of deceased, swore that their father's business
was in better condition at the time of his death
than for years previous. The burner which
bad emitted the gas was old-fashioned, turning
all the way round. As their father was a short
man and had paralysis ot the left hand, they
thought the gas had been turned on acci
dentally. The jury, after a few moments' de
liberation, returned a verdict tbat death was
accidental.
Yon Tiedemann Acquitted.
Carl yon Tiedemann was yesterday acquitted
of a charge of grand larceny, preferred in con
nection witn a half-interest Bwindie perpe
trated on Peter Thompson.
ALL BARS TO

WORK TO BE RUSHED.
Preparations Made to Build a
Roundhouse, Turntable
and Depots.
HAVE AMPLE ROLLING STCCK.
Passengers to Be Carried in About
Two Weeksâ Bicycles to Be
Transported Free.
By the deci-ion of Judge Risley at
Fresno yesterday, denying the petition of
J. C Bhepard for an injunction against
tiie Valley road, and dissolving the re
straining order granted on last Friday,
day, the last bar to the progress of the
Valley road into Fresno has been re
moved.
This welcome news was received at the
local offices of the company yesterday,
and at once orders were given to rush ail
work on the tracks and terminal proper
ties at Fresno, so that traffic to that point
might begin at the earliest possible day.
The outlook now is that freight busi
ness wili be commenced into and around
Fresno by the beginning of next month,
and thai passenger service from San
Francisco through to Fresno, a total
distance of 245 miles, will be inaugurated
a week or two later.
All the necessary equipment is on band
for both passenger and freight business,
and the deiay is caused by the track con
struction into Fresno along Diana and Q
streets. That along Diana street is now
nearly all laid. There yet remains freight
and passenger depots, a roundhouse and a
turntable to be built in Fresno.
Bids have been asked fur the construc
tion of the freight depot and also for the
turntable, and will be submitted next
Monday and acted on the following day.
Vart of the freight df pot will be partitioned
off and used temporarily for passengers.
Plans for the round nou?e are being pre
pared, and bids lor it will be asked for in
a few days.
Passenger rates will be based upon three
cents a mile between Stockton and Fresno,
and between San Francisco and points be
yond Stockton the rate will be a combina
tion of the steamer charges between San
Francisco and Stockton and points be
yond. This will permit of lower rates than
those charged by the Southern Pacific
Company between Ban Francisco and San
Joaquin Valley points.
But another cause of sorrow, tribulation
and loss will be found by the Southern
Pacific Company in the fact that no charge
whatever will be made by the Valley road
for the transportation of bicycles for pas
sengers. They will be treated as baggage.
T. H. Warrington has been appointed
general freight and passenger agent of the
Valley road at Fresno. He was formerly
the Fresno agent of the Santa Fe Railroad.
JUDGE RISLEY'S OPINION.
His Reasons for Denying Shepard's
Application,
FRESNO, Cau, Sept. 22.â The opinion
of Judge Risley in the injunction suit of
J. C. Sbepard to restrain the San Fran
cisco and San Joaquin Valley Railway
Company from constructing its track on
Q street in front of his residence ia a
lengthy one. It proceeds to say:
It may be admitted for ttie purpose of this
motion only that plaintiffs will suffer some
pecuniary damage If the road be built mm in
tended, but it Is not claimed that the de
lendants are not abundantly able to respond
to any damages that may be assessed against
them, and the only question necessary to be
determined herein is the absolute right of
plaintiffs to have defendants restrained until
damages bave been ascertained and a settle
ment thereof made.
The plaintiff* rely upon section 14 of article
I of the constitution of the Slate of California
which read*: '
Private property shall not be taken or damaged
for public use without in*: compensation huvitiz
been first made to or palu into court for the owner.
They contend tbat the laying of the track as
contemplated will be Â«ucb damage as is cov
ered by the above provision and ciie textbook
writers and authorities from several State*
wnicii undoubtedly uphold that position. The
defendants, on the other band, bold exactly
the other way. This precise question has
never been passed uoon by the Supreme Court
oLthis State, and in arriving at a determina
tion this, court will be governed by the reason
CASTORIA
For Infants and Children.
of the rule and the adjudication ot other
States
The grantinK of an injunction rests very
largely- iv the discretion of the court to be gov
erned by the nature of the case end should
only be granted to preserve the right of the
party injured and never when he has an ade
quate remedy at law.
The court then points out that the com
pany received its franchise from the muni
cipal authorities in compliance with law.
The decision proceeds to state that the
fact the work sought to be enjoined is one
of a public nature which affects the public
convenience, and that there is no doubt of
toe ability of thÂ« defendant to respond in
damages are important matters to be con
sidered in determining the right to an in
junction.
The facts stated in the pleadings and
admitted on me hearing of the proceed
ings do not warrant the court to grant the
injunction.
L. L. Cory, Mr. Shepard's attorney,
stated to a Call correspondent to-night
that his client would institute suit tor
damages against tne railway company for
the passing of the road in front of his
premises.
The graders and tracklayers are making
good progress and the track will be laid to
the depot site by Thursday evening.
The Divorce Courts.
Kate A. Hayes was yesterday granted a di
vorce from John Hayes on the ground of ex
treme cruelty. Jurtge Hunt made the decree.
Benjamin Durant was divorced from Hannah
Purant by Judge Sanderson. .Extreme cruelty
was the cause.
The marriage of Rose T. Olivier and Manuel
E. Olivier wn-s yesterday annulled by Judge
Murphy. The youug woman was not of age
wheu ihe ceremony was performed.
On Habeas Corpus.
Judge Troutt yesterday ordered the officers
of the Society for the Prevention of Vice to re.
turn Kmiiy Guillermett, a fourteen-year-old
girl, to her father. The child ia about to bo
come a muthcr, and was taken charge of by
Mr. Welch, and was placed in the Girls' Train
ing Home at 147 Natoma ftreet. The society
will apply for letters of guardianship.

CHTCAPO. Iti,, Sept. 22.â The bull sentiment
which became conspicuous during the closing mo
ments of yesterday's wheat market was rife this
morning at the opening, when an additional :hree
qunrters of a cent was added 10 prices. The de
mand did not continue Imperative, ho'vever, and
after the expiration of the first half hour the tone
settled Into one of steadiness, while the price quo
tations were marked somewhat lower than at first.
Prompt response to our advance of yestei day by
Liverpool, a gain of lV*d being recorded there,
was considered encouraging. L.gnt receipts In the
Northwest, 902, against 1044 last Tue.sdny anj
1208 a year ago, were likewise of aid to values. -
Receipts at Chi. ago were 351 cars and 52,433
bushels were taken Â»rom store. La c continental
cables were assigned as reason for a subsequent
flurry, they being higher all around. Brudsiree s
reported an Increase in the wo.id's aval. sup
ply of 6.111.000 bushels, a arc lne taking place
upon the announcement being made, prices rally
ing again shortly afterward. Export clearances
were light at 192,063 bushels. Ihe cose as at
the 'owes: point of tne session which was, now
ever, Vi^'/so. higher than yesterday. DecÂ»-moer
wheat opened fiom 621& Cto B2y c, sold be ween
638/ 8 c and 6^y s c, closing at 62 Vic bid. Estimated
receipts for 10-morrow 200 cars.
CO â a moderate amount of bull talk on corn,
based prindipally upon the belief that plenty
would beget was.v. assisted by the strong
wheat mar. et, had the effect of lifting prices
in this market quite a little. The general
trade, ~ however, is suspicious of bull move
ments in ibis cereal Just m present so tin-re
was 'an absence of entbus asm. Receipts were
694 cars and 193,499 bushel-> were taken from
store, Liverpool cab es were firm and i^d higher,
liradslreets nave an increase in available stocks of
74 1,000 bushels. Export clears, ices amounted to
191.906 bushels. May Corn opened i.'4T B e. sold

ceipts for to-morrow, 370 cars.
OATSâ Responded &lightlt toimorovrd tone of
other markets. Dull trade was, however, a draw
back to buoyancy. Receipts wcrÂ«) 4.-3 cars ana
152.381 busbeis were taken from store. Exports
were 11.603 bushels. Bradstreet's reported a de
crei.st- in stocks of BU.OOO bushels May oats
closed VsC under yesterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 230 cÂ» rs.

PKOVIMONS-Were nrm, but not active The
firmness was a gift from the hoe and grain mar
kets, but the opinions of professional, recently
made pub that the situation lacked bull en
couragement, tended to deter buyers. January
pork closed unchanged, January lard Â£>@7i^c

Incident of a Royal Wedding
Everything did not pass off quite so
satifactoriiy at Wednesday's royal wed
ding as might bave been thought. The
Datiy News tells to-day of a serio-comic
incident. The Archbishop of Canterbury
and the Bishop of Winchester had strnt
their state robes to Buckingham Palace
early in the day, and it was directed tuat
the same should be taken to the robing
room, where tlie clergy were to assemble
and dress previous to proceeding to the
chnnel at noon.
When the Archbishop and the Bishop of
Winchester arrived not a vestige of their
ye tmen s o aid b> found in the robme
room. The while palace was in a state of
excitement at the weddinp prepara ions
and h- canonical robes were sought after
hirh anÂ« low but ovuld not be tound.
Loril Edward Peiham Ciinton, master of
ihe household, was cilled in to aid in the
*eHrch, and evtnunlly t ne rob^s were
iound in some one else' room just in
time for the service. â Westminister Ga

Exception of the Interior Assemblyman, James Clark of Niles.

WITH THE TICKET
Some Independent Candi

PROSPECTS OF HARMONY
The Enquirer and the Tribune
Unite in Indorsing the
Nominees.
JUDGE WOOD IN DOUBT.
Tbe New County Committee 1
Meet and Organize Next Sat
urday Afternoon.
Oakland Office Saw Fbahcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 22. )
The Republicans at large are generally
satisfied with yesterday's nominations.
For some months it has been apparent
that if the two factions that have been
quarreling for so long were to come to
gether Eome concessions must be made on
both sides. The concessions were made
and there is more harmony in the party
to-day than there has been for two years.
There will be several independent can
didates, bat in view of the general popu
larity of the regular nominees, it is not
thought the independent candidates will
be accorded much support. W. S. Pelouze
in the Fifth District and D. C. Brown in
the Fourth will run alone. Hiram Bailey
of Livermore has no intention of trying to
succeed himÃelf.
Police Judge Wood will have to run in
dependent if his office be declaied a two
year position. A nomination was made
for that office at yesterday's convention
and Wood will contest the giving up of
his seat.
The Tribune and Enquirer, who are
hardly ever together on local issues,
although both stalwart Republican news
papers, unite in indorsing the ticket, and
this is the best evidence that the long fac
tional struggle is over.
The Tribune to-night said editorially:
The Republican convention yesterday met
under mony favorable conditions. A more de
sirable place could not have been selected
than the city of Alameda. The citizens had
provided the very best place for meeting, and
in their liberality had gone beyond all former
precedents in providing in advance sergeants
at-arms at their own cost. â¢ â¢ â¢
Ttie ticket nominated yesterday is worthy of
the support of ail Republicans, and it ought to
win the support of many who are outside the
party. â¢ * â¢
The university and the institution for the
deaf and dumb and blind are objects of special
imerest to the Alameda delegation, although
these interests concern every member of the
Legislature. The nomination of members to
the lower house is also satisfactory. Several
of these nominees have had experience in that
body aud have made a good public record
there. They can all be counted upon for an
honorable and efficient public service.
on the whole it was a good day for tbo Re
publicans of Alameda County. There was
comparatively very little friction and a great
qeai of good work.
The Enquirer says:
The ticket nominated by the Republican
County aud District conventions yesterday is
a generally excellent one. with several spe
cially meritorious features. 8. P. Hall and
.Judge W. E- Greene make a strong judicial
ticket. Mr. Hall's nomination possesses that
iirst requisite of a convention selectionâ it waa
desired by the mass of voters in the party and
!>â¢â¢ many "outside of it. Ever sine* it became
kiiown a year or more ago that he aspired to the
bench Mr. Hall's ntness to sit upon it has been
recognized, and none but complimentary
words have been heard for the ability, integ
rity and judicial temper of the candidate.
Judge Greene's qualities as Â» judge are well
known from his long service, and it is con- |
ceded by all that he is one of the strongest men 1
upon the bencn in tne Superior courts of the
hute.
A specially fit nomination is that of Fred
erick S. Stratton to be Btate Senator. He is a
lawyer, as seems to be necessary in all but a
few exceptional cases to the highest efficiency
as a legislator in this country of written con
stitutions and codified laws.
Upon the Assembly ticket there are several
excellent candidates, of whom the Enquirer
will speak particularly on future occasions
Congratulations ought to be generally ex
tended for the excellent nominations to the
office of Supervisorâ a position for which it is
usually difficult to get first-class men. Mr.
Jarvis, the nominee in the First District, is one
of the most popular and highly respected men
in Washington Township.
The same can be said of Charles Roeth in the
Fourth District and John Mitchell In the
Fifth. Not one of the three is a broken-down
politician or a failure in business who wants
a chance to repair his fortunes in the public
service. All three have made their own busi
ness successful, and, therefore, are likely to
make that of the public so. They are the best
Supervisor nominations made for a good
while.
The new County Committee will meet
next Saturday and organize. J. "W. Evans
and F. J. Fietter are mentioned for chair
man, as it is announced that Charles Mau
talen will not seek re-election.

TWO CHILDREN'S
FATE IN DOUBT
Their Dead Father Was
Manager of the Bella
Union.
WITH A COLORED NURSE
The Mother Procures a Writ
and Demands That They Be
Taken to Her.
RICH FRIENDS INTERVENE.
Do Not Wish the Youngsters to Live
With an Actress Who Smokes
Cigarettes.
Oaelakd Office, San Feakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Sept. 22. J
Mrs. Rogers, a colored woman, residinj
at 2035 Chestnut street, has been serve*
with a writ of habeas corpus, issued a
Bakersfield, demanding that she imme
diately bring two children in her posses
sion to the above place and deliver then
to their mother, Mre. Nestelle, who claim
that she is there in the capacity of house
keeper for a deputy constable named Johi
Conlan.
Mrs. Rogers has acted as foster-mothe
to the children mentioned almost all thei
lives. The writ requires her to bring then
to Bakersneld without further notice, am
she says she has no money to pay travel
ing expenses, which would amount to %3t
or $40. In her dilemma she yesterday
called upon Mrs. Prescott, secretary of th<
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty t<
Children, to inquire if she must obey thi
summons when she had no means to pa:
her way or the children's to Bakersfield
Mrs. Prescott considered that she couh
not be compelled to walk to BakersheU
under the circumstances, nor was it thi
doty of the society to pay the expense.
Mrs. Rogers was then directed to Judgi
Gibson, who relieved the distresset
woman's mind on the point.
Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Pierson of San
Francisco, relatives of the Nestelle chil
dren on thei.* father's side, rusted over to
Oakland, having heard that Mrs. Nestelle
I was trying to remove the children from
the care of Mrs. Rogers, where their dying
father had requested that they should re
main. This arrangement has heretofore
not been opposed by their mother, who
has one child with her, a boy 11 years of
age.
The Piersons came to Â«nter a protest
against Mrs. Nestelle being allowed to
taKe the children, claiming that she is not
a proper custodian for young children.
They informed Mrs. Prescott that she was
an actress in San Francisco and a person
who smokes cigarette*. Mrs. Rogers also
corroborated ttie Piersons' story.
The Piersons were very desirous that
the children be allowed to remain with
Mrs. Rogers, who has raised them care
fully.
The father of the children has been
dead about eighteen months and the
mother has contributed but very little
toward their support.
Just how the matter will be settled will
probabiy be in the courts, for Mrs. Rogeis,
the Piersons and friends of Mr. Nestelle
are determined that the mother shall not
have the children. She has suddenly de
veloped an interest in them and will go
to law to obtain them if possible. At any
rate there will be a fight over the children,
I who are remarkably beautiful in appear
-1 ance aud pretty in manners.

TIES WITH THE COUNCIL.
Board of Education Cannot Force the
Tax Levy.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 22.â City Attor
ney Pieraol, at the request of the Board of
Education, has looked up the law as to
wbetner or not the Council was compelled
to grant to that department as much
money as they deemed necessary to run
the same, it having been contended by
some that such was the case.
The opinion rendered holds that the
Council has discretionary power as regards
the amount of the tax levy that they shall
set aside for the School Department.
While the board is absolute in fixing
salaries of teachers the Council is the final
body in fixing the amount of money that
shall go there from the city tax.

It was reported yesterday that the

day that the report was incorrect. â  The

the National Club would certainly secure
the contest and that he bad just mailed a
letter to Corbett stating that he would de
posit the amount of money asked lor in
the keeping of any person or firm that
Andy Lawrence may appoint.
The managers of the Eureka Club con
tend that â¢ Corbett is playing an in-and
out game, and if they cannot got the Cor
bett and Sharkcy match that they will se
cure one equally as good, as they have a
permit which entitles them to hold a ten
ronnd contest in this City. -â 
> Some of the prominent sporting men of
this City do not hesitate to say that the
issuance of licenses to many alleged
clubs will certainly kill the sport in this
town, as it cannot stand more than two
professional boxing clubs.
Groom is of the opinion that Corbett,
who telegraphed from New York, may
share the same late as Pitzsimmons, who
was arrested recently for having signed
an agreement to right the champion, but
as Corbett states in his message that an
answer must be sent to Asbury Park it is
presumed that he does not anticipate any
trouble in New York from the policy
authorities.
Sharkey and his manager, Lynch, seem
to be perfectly satisfied to agreÂ£ to any
arrangements Corbett may make with the
National Club.

VIRGINIA FAIR
TELLS HER STORY
She Has Not as Good a
Memory as Her
Sister.
SIGNED THAT PETITION
New Dresses in Evidence Dur
ing the Taking of the
Deposition.
THEY CAN'T GET AWAY.
Want to Go Back to Gotham, bat
Restrained by Sub
penas.
Mrs. Oelricbs and her sister, Virginia
Fair, were much more at ease in Notary
Phillips' office yesterday morning than
they had been the looming or the after
noon before. They were deserted by all
tne lawyers except the faithful Reuben
Lloyd and Ilussell Wilson, and the latter
complained of the pleasant footing upon
which the ladies appeared to be with
Lansing Mizner, one of the counsel for
M r>. Craven. At this the ladies were
greatly amused.
They appeared in the morning dressed
in an entirely different toilette tuan that
in which they appeared the day before,
and they appeared in the afternoon ar
rayed entirely differently than they ap
peared in the morning.
Mr. Delmas, called to San Jose, was not
present. Mr. Britton appeared for him
and finished the deposition of Mrs. Oel
richs, and took up and concluded the
deposition of Virginia Fair.
Mrs. Oelrichs was asked during the
morning session it she knew of a contract
under whicn the Fair estate was to pay
Mi>. Nettie Craven $500,000 for her inter
est in the estate.
She declined to state, but in the after
noon she essayed to answer by saying
thrt she did not remember.
During tbe taking of the depositions of
Virginia Fair, Charles Fair came in and
tooit a seat, smiled upon by both his sis
ters.
The deposition of Virginia *'air, con
ducted by Mr. Britton, ran as follows:
"James G. Fair," said the witness, "was
my lather; I was Lorn in San Francisco;
I went to school in this City; my resi
dence is at 453 Fifth avenue. New Yor* ; I
siiw my father alive for the last time in
the latter part of November, 1894, at the
Lick House; I had been visiting nim for
some six weeks; I was in New Ycrt when
1 heard of my father's death; 1 came here
immediately, arriving on the 3d of Janu
ary, 1895."
"Did you, while in this City, see a docu
ment, written In pencil and dated Sep
tember 24. 1894, purporting to be the last
will of your deceased father?"
"I saw such a document in Mr. Lloyd's
office on the sth oi March, 1895. Mr. Lloyd,
Mr. Wheeler, R.chara V. Dey, Ru.-seli
Wilton, my sister and her husband were
present. The will was lying on tbe table,
and I was aÂ»ked to look at it by Mr.
Lloyd, I think. I have never seen the
will since. My brother was not present; I
never saw the document at any time
when my brother was present"
"Did you ever sign a petition asking for
the probate of that will of September 24
as being the genuine will of your de
ceased father?"
"I did."
"Can you tell me why you signed it?"
"Because I thought it was the will of
my fattier; that it was in the handwriting
of my f;U:.er."
"Who signed it wilh you?"
"My sister."
"Do you know whether or not your
brother signed it?"
"I do not."
"Did anybody advise you to sign it?"
"I signed it because I thought it was
the will and not on anybody's advice. I
don't remember any advice. I think I
consulted with my sister, x was told that
two persons saw the will written. 1 don't
remember who told me. :>
'Did you ever hear of the existence of a
paper signed by various people attesting
tot c genuineness of that will?"
"Ye*, sir."
"Who told you about it?"
"I remember two persons â Mr. Neale
and â "
Tbe witness in answer to questions was
going forward to testify further about this
paper when It*". Lloyd interrupted, raying
that there never was such a paper in
existence.
"We are rot taking yocr deposition,
Mr. Lloyd, although we have tried to have
you consent to make one," said Mr. Brit
ton. "You will please allow the witness
to tell what she knows."
"But she doesn't know that, for there
never was such a paper. The lady misun
derstands the reference in the question."
Britton asked the reporter to read the
question again, and when he did so Miss
Fair said she was in error â that she
thought she was asked about the will.
Brition then went back to the matter of
the petition for probate.
"Do you know that your brother ever
signed the petition for the probate of the
will of the 24th?"
â  "I was told so; I don't remember who
told me."
"You were not here during the contest
of Herman Oelrichs Jr?"
"No; 1 heard about it though."
"When you signed that petition for the
probate o. the will of the 24th of Septem
ber you were positive it was the last will
of your deceased â¢ lather and written by
himself?" y
"I was." .
Britton read the strong language of the
petition, in which it was flatly asserted
that thisâ the will of the 24thâ was the
last will and testament of James G. Fair,
wholly written and signed by himself, and
as such the petitioners desired that it be
probated. He asked her if that repre
sented her judgment upon the will at that
time. She said that it did. Lloyd made
some objection to this form of catechising,
as the petition spoke for itself, but he
finally withdrew the objection.
"During your visit in 1894 how long was
it before your departure that you last saw
your father?"
"1 saw him the day I left."
"Did you not send him what is known
as a P. P. C. card?"
"I don't remember."
"You saw him personally, did you?"
"Certainly." -
"How often did you exchange letters
with your father when in New York?"
"About once a week."
Mr. Britton having finished, Mr. Lloyd
asked the witness if she had not received a
letter irom her father a few days after his
death. She said that she hud not but had
received a letter two days before his death.
The talcing of the deposition of Mrs.
Craven was fixed for this morning, with
the understanding that it couwt be post
poned from day to day if the lady was not
physically able.
Mrs. Oelrichs and Miss Fair were to
have left for New York this afternoon,
but the summons rcQuixins their deposi
tion in the Craven ejectment suits next
Monday will not permit of their leaving.

Bought a Lodging-Holla*)
Mrs. G. Mallett swore to a complaint In
Judge Low's court yesterday for the arrest ot
John and Emma Vreenhacch on the charge of
obtaining money by false pretenses. She al

16 for the good will and furniture in the lodg
ing-house 207 Post street and found that the
furniture did not belong to them.

CLEVELAND AS
JUDAS ISCARIOT
At a Silverite Meeting H.
K. Mitchell so Por
trays Him.
"THAT ACT OF 1873."
John Sherman Accused of Sur
reptitiously Demonetiz
ing Silver.
WHAT REYNOLDS YEARNED FOR
Discussion of the Tariffâ Speeches by
Thomas F. Haggerty and
P. M. Wellin.
A joint meeting of the Thirty-ninth and
the Thirty-first district silver clubs was
held at the People's party tent last even
ing. Prior to opening the meeting a small
boy was stationed in the entrance with a
snaredruin. He made as much noise as
the "drummer boy of the Rappahan
nock," but failed to awaken a responsive
chord in the breasts of the passing crowds,
and when Hon. H. K. Mitchell of Nevada
was introduced as the first speaker of the
eveniug by William Walsh, president ot
the Thirty-ninth club, he was perforce
obliged to address scarcely more than a
few stragglers. Later on the house filled
until a fair-sized audience faced the
speaker.
Mitchell began bis oratorical effort by
throwing verbal stones at the "act of 1873,
which demonetized silver."
"Jonn Sherman," be declared, "was the
man responsible for that base act. It was
he who surreptitiously inserted in an act
covering fifteen pages of the Congressional
Record a single line providing that gold
should be the unit of value.
â¢'Grant signed that act, without realiz
ing the full intent of the disaster brought
ou by the scratching of hie quill, and when
he learned afterward of that clause
slipped in by Sherman he bitterly deniea
any knowledge of the existence of the line
making gold the standard of value."
After a lengthy ram ble among the musty
tomes of Grecian and Roman antiquity
the speaker returned to the age of the liv
ing and accused McKinley of having for
saken his litelonK convictions for the gold
oi trusts and corporations. Not content
with the chance McKinley's record fur
nished him for vituppration, Mitchell
turned his guns against Grover Cleveland,
where he was evidently more at home.
"I want to teii you what I think of
Grover Cleveland," lie shouted â -'that
most damnable of all traitors. If he had
lived in the aye of Judas Iscariot the lat
ter's name would never have been perjetu
ated as the greatest traitor in the history
of the earth. Cleveland's name will be
immortalized as the Benedict Arnold of
the Democratic party."
After quoting various statistics on the
financial question Mitchell said silver had
been used as a medium of exchange since
the beginning of the world, and read an
extract from the Book of Genesis to prove
his assertion. His hearers applauded as
he left the platform.
The next speaker was C. A. Reynolds.
He characterized the present political
condition as a contest in which the plain
people were on one side and the Shyiocks
on tne other. What his empty heart
yearned for was the "dollar of the consti
tution," incidentally with an increased
purchasing power.
Thomas F. Haggerty was then intro
duced as "ourold-tinie Populist and silver
man, who was willing to address t c as
semblage." Mr. Haggertv evidently did
not like this, as he defined himself at the
outset as a Democrat â not a Jeffersonian
nor even a Jacksonian Democrat, but a
William Jennines Bryan Democrat. His
speech was devoted mainly to outlining
the various periods in American history
and an elucidation of the reforms in
augurated by Democracy. He believed
protection entirely unnecessary; that this
country can compete with any nation,
even the pauper labor oi Europe, and come
out triumphant.
Some of Haggerty's language 'regarding
England did not suit a gray -haired mem
ber of the audience and he made audible
protest several times, evoking hisses and
catcalls. Tne speaker finally invited the
disturber to depart and seek consolation in
the "still, small voice of nature" if he did
not like his words. The old gentleman did
not depart and raised a hue and cry sev
eral times afterward.
Haggerty's speech wao very lengtny
and was mostly devoted to the political
outlook as he found it in the East and
Europe.
The last speaker of the evening was P.
M. Wellin, who spoke at great length on
the tariff and silver questions. The meet
ing then adjourned after the chairman
had announced another meeting for next
Tuesday eve ning.

DIAMOND ROBBERY.
Gas Devine Arrested in Connection
With the Becent Affair in Sac
n.nieuto.
Gus Devine, who is not unknown to the
police, was arrested about 6 o'clock yester
day morning in a saloon on Post and Du
pont streets. He was taken to the City
Prison and booked en route for Sacra
mento.
Devine Is supposed to be the accomplice
of Frank Holden in the diamond robbery
at Sacramento on Friday evening. Holdtn
threw a rock at the rrind'owof th* jewelry
store of H. Wachorst, on J street, and
grabbed two trays containing diamonds.
One he dropped inside the window, but he
ran away with the other. He was pur
sued and captured, but none of the
diamonds, valued at $2000, were found
upon him, an>i the supposition was that
he had handed them to a confederate, ex
cept eiglit, valued at $500, which he had
dropped from the tray during his flight,
ana which were afterward recovered. An
officer will arrive from Sacramento to-day
to take Devine there.
Devine has been twice arrested for as
sault with a deadly weapon, but managed
to escape punishment.

Miss Spooner has several valuable pic
tures in Boston, and was about to send
the California collection to that city, when
she was persuaded by representatives of
the San Francisco Art Association to lend
her art treasures to the Mark Hop&ins

LORING CLUB CONCERT.
Classical Programme Rendered by Art
ists Before a Large and Ap
preciative Audience.
Last night's concert of the Loring C!nb
attracted a large and appreciative audi
ence to Odd Fellows' Hall. The pro
gramme was perhaps rather classical for a
general audience, but was cordially re
ceived.
Among the choral numbers were the
Theresa waltzes of "Faust." "The Desert
Fountain" by Gade, a chorus from "The
Voyage of Columbus" by Buck. "Myste
rious Night" by Debois, "Heine yon
Sieier" by Engelsnerg and Mobr's "Hymn
of Praise."
"Hiawatha's Farewell" was splendidly
rendered by J. G. Hump! the well
known baritone, and John Marquadt's in
teipretation of Barasate's fantasia from
"Faust" was cordially applauded.
Miss Adele Brown gained new laurels
by her expressive rendering of the waltz
son? from Guonod's "Koraeo and Juliet"
and several other classic selections.
The concert throughout was of a very
bigh . order and the participants seemed
well deserving of the applause with which
they were greeted.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1896.
THE "EXAMINER" OPPOSED
FREE COINAGE.
Roundly Denounced 16 to 1 and the
"Windy West."
Last Year Editor Hearst Said Ruin Would Surely
Follow Any Lower Ratio Than
25 to I.
The Call herewith presents some interesting facts bearing on the attitude of the
San Francisco Examiner and the New York Morning Journal on the silver question,
facts which show young Mr. Hearst in his coat of many colors â now blowing hot for
silver, awhile ago blowing cold on the same issue.
It should be remembered that the millionaire silver-mine owner is the editor of
the only paper in New York that advocates the free coinage of silver and the owner
of the only morning paper in San Francisco that is supporting the free-silver can
didate for the Presidency. The argument which Mr. Hearst's editors are now pound
ing away on is that the f~ee coinage of silver will benefit the poor man â that the rich
are all opposed to Bryan and his Chicago platform. â 
However, in the inventory of the estate of Senator Hearst, left to Mrs. Hearst and
William R. Hearst, are fÂ«>und some facts and figures that would point to a very strong
personal interest in the free coinage of silver on the part of Mr. Hearst himself.
Mr. Hearst is not a poor man â not by a good many million dollars. Senator
Hearst left his widow and son over $5,000,000 worth of silver mining stock â the exact
fignre, as estimated by the appraisers, being $5,369,529 60. With the Anaconda stock,
not counted, as it has since been sold, the estate still owns $1,769,529 worth of invest
ments in silver mines.
Following is the appraisement of the mining stock alone left by Senator Hearst, the
silver mines being designated by heavy black type:

The foi lowing extracts from the New York Morning Journal and the Examiner,
shown in parallel columns, give a fair idea of the ease with which Mr. Hearst chansres
his opinions on vital questions of the day. The Examiner in particular was opposed
to the free coinage oi silver until Bryan was nominated, "but it changed its tune
without shame or apology," as the Oregonian says, "and at once became an extreme
advocate of silvnrism." The Journal denounced the Chicago platform as late as July,
and stated without reserve that it was a policy of partial repudiation. The quotations
speak for themselves and are as follows:
FAVORS 25 TO I.
Examiner, May 4, 18M5- The ratio at which
we could safely coin silver under an inter
national agreement is not the same under
which we could do it nlone. With the assist
ance of the principal commercial nations we
could open our mines in security at 15% to 1.
To maintain the parity alone it might be
necessary to make the proportion 25 to 1.
Our experience has not encouraged us to be
lieve we could do this alone at 16 to 1.
1 6 TO 1 A HERESY.
Examiner, May 17, 1895â 1t is the extrem
ists on both sides who are doing all the talking
on the silver question. â¢ â¢ â¢ While the
Illinois Democrats demand the free coinage of
silver at 16 to 1 without international agree
ment, the masses are real bimetallists. They
do not want either to reduce silver to the rank
of token money or to drive gold out of the
country. They are not euperstitiously wedded
to the ratio of 16 to 1.
FREE COINAOE~DANQEROUS.
Examiner, Mry 22. 1895~1t is easy to un
derstand how Mr. Carlisle, who thought it
safe to venture upon free coinage when the
bullion in a silver dollar was worth 90 cents,
should be unwilling to take the chances when
the r&te has cotr.e down to 50 cents.
AGAINST THE_BRYAN PLAN.
Examiner, May 30. 1895â Senator Sherman
could easily have made a strong argument
against the free coinage of silver by this coun
try at the present ratio, but apparently he
preferred to maite a weak one.
FREE COINAGE DENOUNCED.
Examiner, Mny 25, 1895â Mr. Carlisle's
speech at Memphis was a very able effort. As
regards the 16 to 1 proposition it was nearly
conclusive. â¢ â¢ â¢ The only question is
how much the 'ofjislation of any one country
can do. When Mr. Carlisle says that it could
not possibly restore the old parity of 16 to 1
he is probably right, but when be holds it
could do nothing ne is probably wrong.
THE WINDY WEST.
Examiner, April 18â President Cleveland's
letter on the money question has excited more
indignation among the silver men than could
be justified by its wording. â¢ â¢ â¢ His
hopes for sound money and the protest against
the "illusions of a debased currency" â¢ Â» â¢
might be echoed by every man of ordinary
sanity in the country. â¢ â¢ â¢ The President
is hardly less safe when he deprecates
silver monometallism. But the meaning to be
read into the letter by President Cleveland's
acts and opinions in the past makes these
harmless platitudes the red rag to the silver
champions of the windy West.

BELIEVES IN 16 TO 1.
Examiner, September 13, 1896â TJndeT free
coinage the silver dollar will be worth exactly
the same as the gold dollar, and the parity be
tween silver and gold coined or uncoined will
be 16 to 1 throughout the world.
16 TO 1 A CURE-ALL.
Examiner, September 13. 1896â When we
have free coinage of both gold and silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1 there will be a breaking up
of the hard financial winter that hag frozen
the industrial energies of this new and
wealthy country.
FREE COINAGE BENEFICENT.
Examiner, September 8, 1896-But IfTthe
United States by throwing open Its mints to
free coinage raises the bullion ratio to 16 to 1,
all coins struck at this ratio will then become
full and independent parts of the world's
currency. They will be real money instead of
representative money.
BRYAN'S PLAN INVINCIBLE.
The Examiner, Sept. 10, 1896â 8 at at least
Mr. Bryan's attack on the existing system is
not to be answered. Very wisely the Demo
cratic nominee has taken the offensive.
FREE COINAQE APPROVED.
Examiner, Sept. 21, 1896â From the begin
nlng of this campaign it has been asserted in
these columns that the straight road and the
only road to international bimetallism is the
undertaking of an independent course in this
regard by the United States.
THE WEST_IS WISE.
Examiner, Sept. 12, 1896â The fanners of
lowa are wise. They are going to vote for
Bryan. The downward course of prices ot
farm produce in the past twenty years is suffi
cient demonstration for them that if the con
stant appreciation of the gold dollar is to be
continued they will very soon lose what they
have. â¢ â¢ â¢
The immediate effects of free coinage we
may thus conclude would not be to make acute
changes in prices or to disorganize induntrv.

UNCLE SAM'S MAIL
WORK OF A YEAR
Report of the Fourth As
sistant Postmaster-
General,
OFFICES ESTABLISHED.
Special Reference Made and
Praise Given to the Work
of Inspectors.
NOTED CRIMINALS CAPTURED.
Many Green-Goods Men Now Behind
the Barsâ Other Features
of the Report
The annual report of Fourth Assistant
Postmaster-General Maxwell, just made
public through Local Inspector-in-Charge
Munro, contains much of interest.
There are three divisions under the
charge of the Fourth Assistant Postmaster-
Gensral, namely, appointments, bonds and
commissions, and postoffice inspectors and
mail depredations. The report outlines
the work of the bureau for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1896.
On that date the total number of post
offices in operation in the United States
was 70,360. Of these, 66,725 were fourth
class offices and 3695 Presidential, being an
increase over the last fiscal year of 296.
During the year 2046 postoffices were estab
lished and 1750 discontinued. The total
number of appointments for the year was
12.090 and the total number of cases acted
upon 15,532.
During the year the largest gain in the num
ber of offices has been in Mississippi, 83
Georgia following with 54. The greatest loss
has occurred in West Virginia, 23. Twenty
six States and Territories show a net gain of
484, while nineteen snow a net loss of 188.
The number of offices in Alaska, Delaware
District oi Columbia, Illinois, Rhode Island
and South Dakota has remained unchanged
It will be seen that 2016 postoffices have
been established the pasi nscal rear and 1750
discontinued, a net gain of 296. Wherever
the exigencies of the case seemed to demand
offices have been established, but in many in
stances where the proposed office would be too
near one already in operation the department
has declined to establish it.
That the work of this division is as nearly
up to date hs its character will admit is best
evidenced by tne following facts: Only a trifle
over 1 per cent of the postmasters in the
United States have resignations on file, while
a little over one-tenth of 1 per cent of the of
fices are vacant from deaths of postmasters.
This is by far the smallest number of resig
nations and reports o, death on rile since the
postal system has approached its present pro
portions.
By far the most interesting of the statis
tical tables in the report is the following,

This table shows the gradual increase in the
number of postoffices from the time when
mails were transported almost entirely on
horseback to the present day of steam and
electricity. The records of this bureau fail to
give the number of offices in existence in 1813.
With the exception of a slight decline in 1842,
the table shows a steady increase from 1790 to
1859, when for severm years the variation was
slignt until 1865, during which year 8328
offices in excess of the number established
were dropped from the records, owing to the
disorganized condition of affairs at that time.
Since that date the number has steadily in
creased.
Of the twenty postoffices in the Territory of
Alaska, but one has reached the Presidential
class. Juneau was made a third-class office on
the Ist day oi April last.
Since the organization of the Inspector force,
a quarter of a century ago, it has not simply
developed in numerical strength, but has se
cured such high character and effectiveness in
its personnel as to entitle it to rank as one of
the most important adjuncts of the postal ser
vice.
Under the head of arrests for offenses against
the postal laws it is shown that during the
year there were 2074. of which number 158
were postmasters, 55 were assistant postmas
ters, 43 were clerks In postoffices, 14 were rail
way posioffice clerks, 34 Were letter-carriers,
49 were mailcarriers and 9 others were em
ployed in minor positions in the postal ser
vice. Four hundred and seventy postofflce
burglars were arrested, while the remainder of
1225 were persons not connected with the
postal service, who were arrested for various
offsnses against the postal laws. Of this num
ber 1108 cases were disposed of iv the United
States courts and 38 in the State courts.
There were 1621 postofflces burglarized dur
ins the fiscal year 1894, and 1561 offices sub
jected to' the same class or depredation in
1895. or a decrease of 2 per cent, while during
the last year there were 1474 reports of
burglaries received, or a further decrease of a
little less man 6 per cent for the year, and a
decrease of a little over 9 per cent as com
pared with 1894. On the other hand, wnile
the burglaries are shown to be on the increase,
the number of burglars apprehended indicates
a corresponding increase. During the year
1894 there were 351 of these offenders ar
rested. Id 1895 tne number of burglars cap
tured was 423, being an increase of 29 per
cent, and during the last fiscal year 470 such
criminals were apprehended, making an in
crease of 10 per cent over the previous year.
Thus, while the number of postoffices depre
dated upon by this dangerous class of crimi
nals has steadily decreased during the past
two years, the number of offenders arrested
has increased nearly 34 per cent.
The final pages of the report are ren
dered peculiarly interesting by a brief
synopsis of some of the special cases suc
cessfully prosecuted during the last year,
and they afford an insight into the meth
ods employed by postollice inspectors.
Among these canes may be mentioned
that of William B. Marsh, tried and con
victed of robbery of the mail staee near
Houston, Idaho: the robbery of the mail
stage near Spear fish, 8. D., by George R.
Hayes and Ulysses G. Pitts; the holdup
and robbery of (he Oregon mail train near
Kiddle, Or.; the arrest of George Carson
and Sidney Yennie, who were implicated
with Killoran, Allen and Russell in a
number of bold daylight robberies of post
office safes, wherein the robbers secured
thousands of dollars' worth of stamps;
and the apprehension of Abe Rothschild,
who, though only forty-five years old, has,
according to his own confession, over two
hundred criminal charges against him in
the United States, distributed in every
State and Territory, and wqo has com
mitted crimes in Canada, Mexico, Cuba,

England and France. This confirmed
offender attempted to purchase his release
from the inspector who first arrested him
in California, and has tried to bribe every
jailer who has had him in custody since.
It is evident that General Maxwell does
not intend to leave any doubt in the minds
of those who read his report as to his vig
orous warfare upon the "green goods"
swindle, and particularly upon those who
are engaged in the dissemination of scur
rilous and obscene matter. He speaks
upon this latter subject with mnch earnest
ness and reiterates his recommendation
that more stringent statutes be enacted
relating to it.
In previous reports reference has been made
to the successful efforts of the inspectors in
checking the distribution of scurrilous and
obscene matter through the mails. The
offenses of ti is nature are of various degrees
of gravity, ranging from mere technical viola
tions of the law to the 'most shocking and out
raeeous assaults upon decency and morality.
The postal card and anonymous letter are
most frequently utilized, as they afford a se
cret and apparently safe method for the grati
fication of malice and spite. The investiga
tion of this class of cases often leads to most
startling disclosures. Both men and women
of high rank and station in life and appar
ently good breeding and refinemer. t have
beer, discovered to be the senders of the most
shocking examples of this closs of matter, and
the revelations made have in some instances
led to acrimonious dissensions, resulting in
the division of communities.
The immense profits realized from the sale
of obscene literature have induced dealers to
run great risks, and sample copies of such
publications are often sent by mail into schools
and seminaries. This nefarious business was
attaining alarming proportions on the Pacific
Coast and the local officers appeared powerless
to check it. The matter was placed in the
hands of our inspectors, and as a result iv the
thirteen months preceding June last one pub
lisher and three of the largest dealers in that
territory have been arrested, convicted and
imprisoned. The moral effect of taese convic
tions cannot be overestimated.
