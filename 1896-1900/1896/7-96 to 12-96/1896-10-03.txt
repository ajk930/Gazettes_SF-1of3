Havoc Caused by the Great

Cedar Keys.
SCCRES OF VESBELS WRECKED
AND CREWS DROWNED.
Sad Scenes of Desolation and Devas
tation in a Path Fifty
Miles Wide.
JACKSONVILLE, Fia., Oct. 2.â The
"West India hurricane which struck Flor
ida Tuesday, though it lasted but three
hours, was the most disastrous storm ever
experienced in Florida. The damage to
property in the State alone will foot up a
million dollars.
Fully a hundred lives were lost and per
haps 10,000 people were rendered home
less. Tbe course of the storm was from
Cedar Keys, on the Gulf coast, north by
northeast to and through the thriving
town of Lake City. Through th* path
fifty miles wide few houses are left stand
ing, tlie wind at times blowing at the rate
i of 100 miles an hour and averaging 80.
In Jacksonville scores of buildings were
nnroofed and trees blown down. The
â  storm had the characteristics of a tor
â¢nado. Ii skipped some places in its path,
bounding over to others, where ruin was
wrought. Cedar Keys was exposed to the
full force of its fury. There a score of
fishermen on the sponge banks were
drowned and their vessels were wrecked.
A tidal wave visited the town and inun
dated it. During the tidal wave a fire
broke out, and the unusual spectacle was
â¢witnessed of firemen fighting flames al
most shoulder deep in water.
Lake City had almost every tree in the
town blown down and for two days the
streets were impassable. Two people
were killedâ â¢ prominent lady, Mra. Fra
zier, and a neg r o boy. Here many houses
. were razed, while the roofs of others went
ywhirlins through the air. Lake City is in
Columbia County, which has great lum
ber interests. Half of the yellow pine
timber was blown down and lumber and
turpentine men lost thousands of dollars,
as the lumber is badly splintered and will
Boon be attacked by worms.
In Baker County, which joins Columbia,
nox a score of bouses out of a thousand
were left standing. Grain stored in barns
was blown away or destroyed by rain.
Across the fields cotton was destroyed and
.thousands of cattle were killed. The im
mense lumber mill of Eppinger & Russell
at Otusee was destroyed, including stores
and residences, and many people were
hurt, though none were killed.
At Macclenny, in the same county, the
same tale might be told.
* Sanderson, a few miles distant, was al
most wiped out. Ail of the men employed
in the tun entine factories and lumber
mills are not only homeless, but without
food, and a famine there is impending.
The citizens of each of these towns have
organized relief committees and have is
sued appeals to the public for aid. Hil
. liards, in Duval County, was also devas
tated and people killed and wounded by
the falling of houses upon them.
SCENE OF DEFANTATION.
Vessels Go Down in the Hurricane and
Many Lives Are Lost.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Oct. 2.â A letter
from Cedar Keys, Fla., dated October 1,
says: The West India hurricane, of which
tne Weather Bureau gave warning, struck
Cedar Keyes about 3:30 o'clock Tue day
morning and left a scene of wreckage and
devastation in its wake.
It is by far the most destructive storm
that has ever visited this portion of ihe
(^>ulf coast in twenty years, and the prop
erty loss is immense. Though warning
had been given nothing indicated a blow
of unusual severity. Up to 11 o'clock the
night was calm and quiet. At that -hour
a moderate breeze sprang up from the
eastward, increasing gradually until a
thirty-mile wind was blowing. About 4
A. M. it blew a perfect tornado and sud
denly changed to the southeast, bringing
in a perfect deluge of water, the tide
rising two feet higher than it did in the i
memorable gale of 1884, wnich was at the
time said to be t^e severest storm on
record.
At 7 o'clock an immense tidal wave
came in from the south, carrying destruc
tion with it. Boats, wharves and small
houses were hurled upon the shore, and
breaking into fragments covered the
streets with wreckage, rendering them
almost impassable, while the torrents of
water rustling through every open space
would take the strongest man off his feet.
At 11 a. M. the worst was over, the wind
subsidea, tne water began to recede, and
by 2 p. m. people began reckoning up the
| losses and clearing away th 3 wreckage.
I The property loss is very heavy. A-.ide
! from direct damage from the storm, while
the gale was at us heignt fire broke out in
the Bottini House and it was burned.
The wind totally demolished the large
handsome Methodist Episcopal Church
South, the Cedar Keys High School, tne
Christian Church and three colored
. churches, several private residences and
fall the fish-houses except one. It also
Ibaaly damaged a number of residences
wnd stores.
The Suwanee Ice Factory, Wolf's Cedar
Mill, the Eagle Pencil Company's mill,
also the large lumber mill of V. J. Her
long and the planing mill of Moyer &
Bons, just completed and ready for work,
Buffered considerably. The Florida Cen

COLD BUG
tral and Peninsular railroad is a heavy
loser, as all the track trestling is washed
away for a distance of three and a half
miles. It will probably De a month before
the trains run through.
The adjoining island of Atscena Otic also
suffered considerably, the Faber company
being the principal losers. Their storage
room, with about 3100 cases oi cedar ready
for shipment, was washed away, and the
cedar has gone to sea. They also lost the
office buildings and contents, which were
cedar logs. Great as the loss of property
is, it is feared that the next few days will
reveal a deplorable loss of life as well. So
far as heard up to Thursday, eighteen per
sons have been drowned. Of the whites
six belonged to one family, a mother, four
childr n and a nieca.
The Mary Eliza, a sponging schooner,
came in at 10 o'clock Tuesday morning.
Jury-rig ing *ad to be cut away to pre
vent capsizing. She roported that at dark
Monday night nearly 100 vessels were an
chored on the sponge bars and at daylight
this morning not one was in sight. Some
may have made harbors at other points,
but many have gone down.
At 7 p. m. Wednesday part of the crew,
eight men, of the sponger Annie came
ashore in dingys and reported that the
schooner bad capsized and sunk off shore
and four men had been drowned. Much
anxiety is felt in regard to the fishermen
encamped on the island along the coast
and others who left for Tampa yesterday.
The result of the storm will be particu
larly disastrous to those engaged in the
fishing industry, which had opened with
the most flattering prospects for a success
ful season. Cat off from shipment by
railroad they will lose at least a month of
their best time and cannot hope to do
more tban pay expenses.
Several large stores, warehouses, boat
houses and residences were unroofed and
otherwise damaged.
Numerous small craft are missing, and
the crewa of some are saved and others
lost. Many of the rescued men report ter
rible experiences, some clinging for life
to capsized boats, and others hanging on
to tree tops, beaten and buffeted by wind
and waves until almost exhausted. They
all show the effects in their tattered cloth
ing and bruised flesh, but are thankful to
escape with their lives. Many others are
still unaccounted for and families and
friends are filled with anxiety, hoping for
the best, but fearing the worst.
AT THE MERC E OF GALES.
Captain Smith Tells of the Destruction
to Shipping at Savannah.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct 2.â Captain
Frederick Smith of the steamship
Naco"chee, which arrived from Savannah
this morning, told a number of thrilling
tales of the havoc wrought by the recent
storm.
"The worst of the storm," said he, "was
on Tuesday afternoon. We were tied to
our pier in the Savannah River, and,
although our mooring held, others gave
way all about us. By dinner-time at
least fifty vessels had broken away and
drifted on a frightful sea.
"Steam and sailing vessels were wrecked
immediately astern of us. Further
down stream I saw at least ten more
steamships at the mercy of the tempest.
"A Norwegian bark called the Rosenius
broke from her moorings and capsized in
the middle of the river, one man going to
bis death. From the deck of my vessel
we could see the roofs of chqrches, schools,
private houses and hospitals flying through
the air."
Rnfus S. Moxon, a merchant from Bos
ton, who was on the Nacoochee, tells of a
thrilling ride on a wild Texan pony
through forty miles of swamp lands to
Savannah. He said that all along the
route trees were uprooted and fell across
the track. For seven hours he rode furi
ously, dodging death at every turn and
when finally he was out of danger the
brave little pony that had taken all the
obstacle jumps superbly, and to which he
really owed his life, dropped dead from ex
haustion and frignt.

GREETINGS OF DELEGATIONS.
Confidence, Says tbe Republican C
didate, Will Restore the Pros
perity of the Nation.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 2.â After nearly â¢
week of continuous rain and wind, which
have greatly interfered with the reception
of delegations by Major McKinley, the
sun broke out this morning and the
clouds were cleared away. Among Major
McKinley's early callers were Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts;
Theodore Roosevelt, president of the New
York Police Board; Congressman Dalzell
of Pennsylvania and Congressman Nelson
Dingley, chairman of the Waya and Means
Committee. They have been making
speeches in this part of the country and
called to pay their respects to the candi
date and tell him of the prospects in the
different sections in which they have
traveled. This is how they sura up the
situation:
Mr. Dingley said: "The outlook for a
Republican victory is more than promis
ing. It seems now only a question of how
large a plurality will be given Major Mc-
Kinley."
Mr. Dalzell said: "I have been all
through West Virginia, and I am con
vinced that the State will be carried by the
Republicans."
Mr. Lodge said: "Speaking for Massa
chusetts, I can say tha*. the majority for
McKinley this year will far exceed the
Republican majority of two years ago,
which was 64,000."
Mr. Roosevelt said: "The indications
are that New York will give McKinley the
greatest majority ever accorded any can
didate. In fact the sentiment in the East
is all in favor of the ReDublican ticket."
Rutherford Hayes, son of the late Presi
dent Rutherford B. Hayes, called on
Major McKinley to-day, as did also Harry
Garfield, son of the late President James
A. Garfield. Bishop Van Yleck called this
afternoon.
About noon a delegation of 350 farmers
from the West Virginia panhandle arrived.
They were met the depot Dy the Canton
mounted troop and escorted to the taber
nacle. The members of this delegation
claim that many of the farmers who had
contemplated joining the party at Wheel
ing were detained because of washouts on
the railroads caused by the recent floods.
A delegation of railroad men from Chi
cago Junction and Huron County, Ohio,
about 600 strong, arrived al about the same
time.
In response to the addresses delivered
by the spokesmen for their delegations
Major McKinley said:
It gives me special pleasure to meet at my
home in a joint meeting the citizens of the
State of West Virginia and of my own native
State. A Republican has no embarrassment in
speaking to an American audience. He does
not have to make a different speech for a dif
ferent locality. [Laughter and applause.] Tde
great thought of the people of this country,
wherever they may reside or whatever may be
their occupation, is how we are to tret back as
a Nation to the old conditions of business
activity and prosperity. In a single word, the
trouble with the country is a lack of confi
dence. As to what has brought about that
lack of confidence we may differ; that there is
a lack of confidence everywhere every one
must concede, for every citizen has felt it in
his. own trade and experience. Now, what Is
this thing called "business confidence"? It is
a belief in the stability of values; faith in our
markets and our money; faith that the con
sumption of next year will be as great or
greater than the present one; faith that men
will have work and that the currency of the
country will be fixed and stable aud undepre
elating in value. [Great applause.]
This thing called "business confidence"
never shuts up an American mill; never re
ducts wages or curtailed employment; never
refuses loans; never got up a run on a bank;
never stopped a mine; nover created idleness
among laboring men. [Applause.] VVhencon
fldeuce is present with us the Sheriff has less
to do [great laughter and applause] and adver
tises fewer forced sales. [Renewed applause.]
The court docket registers fewer judgments, j

"souphouse" ' Is s unknown ? and ; unnecessary.
[Tremendous cheers.] 1 :) When confidence ;ii

battalions, and ; suffering , falls :on every com
munity.,; [Applause.] No part .of our popula
tion is exempt. .It may come from one thine
or it may come from another. Doubt in ; the
business world is death to business. [Applause

AN UNBLUSHING FORGER Y.
Lincoln Did Hot Use the Words Attributed
-': ( :'.-' to Him by Democrats. .; Â£? _ ,'i-^v,':
".J CHICAGO, : 111., Oct. : 2.â Perry S. Heath
of the Republican National Committee to
day Â»â¢ received i from John , G. Nicolay, one
of President Lincoln's secretaries, a letter
in which he declares "spurious" an alleged
quotation j from - Lincoln now in general
circulation as a Democratic campaign doc
ument. The quotation thus condemned is
as follows: ,. y â ;,'â -' " â  Ââ¢-./;'
"Mr. Lincoln said: 'As a result of the
war corporations have been enthroned and
an era of corruption in high places will
follow, and the money power of the coun
try will endeavor to prolong its reign by
working on the prejudices of the people,
until all wealth is aggregated in a few
hands and the Republic is destroyed. I
feel at this moment more anxiety lor the
safety of my country than ever before,
even in the midst oi war. God grant that
my suspicions may prove groundless.' "
Mr. Nicolay continues: "This alleged
quotation from Mr. Lincoln is a bald, un
blushing forgery.' The great President
never said it or wrote it, and never said or
wrote anything that by the utmost license
could be distorted to resemble it. Its
origin appears to date back to 1888, as it
first obtained circulation in a little pam
phlet printed by a radical agitator in
lowa, copyrighted on May 10 of that year.
It appears now without explanation or
credit."
Ex-Governor Pitkin of Louisiana called
at headquarters to-day. He has been
speaking in Maine and now goes to point:
in the Mississippi Valley. He declares the
McKinley sentiment everywhere is as
tonishing.
A near neighbor of Mr. Bryan at Lin

LITTLE TO THE RESCUE.
The Assistant Attorney-General
Temporarily Protects the
Amphibians.
THIS CITY OWNS THE ROCKS.
But the Government by Special Act
of Congress Can Protect the
Bay Fish Industry.
WASHINGTON. D. C, Oct. 2.âAssist
ant Attorney-General Little of the Inte
rior Department to-day gave an opinion
at the request of Assistant Secretary Sims
' of that department concerning the seal
rocke, situated off Point Lobos. In 1887
the rocks were granted by act of Congress
to the City and County of San Francisco
â  in trust and under certain conditions, one
provision of which was that the United
States may at all times control and limit
or diminish the number of seals resorting
to said rocks so as to protect the fisheries
and fishing industries. It was provided
further that when said rocks should be
required by the United States Govern
ment title to them was to be reinvested in
the United States. The Attorney-General
says:
"I am asked for an opinion as to whether
the Secretary of the Interior is charged
with the duty of carrying into effect the
right reserved to the United States in the
first proviso of said act to 'at all times
control and limit or diminish the number
of seals resorting to said rocks so as to
protect the fisheries and fishing indus
tries.'
"It is urged that seals have become so
numerous on these rocks as to seriously
interfere with the fisheries industry in
San Francisco Bay, and the Commis
sioner of Fish and Fisheries recommends
that these seals be entirely destroyed or
their number diminished to such an ex
tent as to grant the relref asked.
"I find in the papers a report of the
Commissioner of the General Land Office,
to the effect that the City and County of
San Francisco, Cal., has accepted the
trust imposed by the act. lam of the
opinion that this is a matter exclusively
within the jurisdiction and control of the
Congress of the United States. This de
partment of the Government is only
charged with the control of the public do
main, and the Seal Rocks, having been
granted by the act quoted, are no longer
part of that domain. It is true, certain
rights were reserved to the United States
in the premises, but having once taken
the property out of executive control,
without providing specifically for execu
tive supervision of the reserved interest,
it would seem that an act of Congress is
necessary to reinvest this department
with jurisdiction."
INDICTMENT OF AUCTIONEERS.
New York Authorities Begin a Crusade on
Houses Where Glaring Swindles
Are Conducted.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 2.â The Sep
tember Grand Jury this afternoon handed
in several indictments against auctioneers
in this city for conducting fraudulent
auctions, and in addition, an indictment
against those auction houses against
whom sufficient evidence to warrant an
indictment had been procured. Arrests
will probably be made soon.
The presentment, in part, says:
"Among the various fraudulent devices
may be mentioned the practice of procur
ing false, fictitious and fraudulent bids
from 'puffers' or by bidders who regularly
attend these auctions in the interest and
in the pay of the auctioneer with the par
pose of making such fraudulent and ficti
tious bids against bona fide bidders in
order to enhance the price of the article
offered for auction. In addition to this
practice, evidence has been adduced show
ing that in at least one instance it was the
custom of an auctioneer to keep in stock
an article of high grade and quality wnich
he put up for sale Irom day to day while
furnishing to those persons making the
highest bids a similar article of inferior
quality."

Both Sides.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 2.â General Mel
guiz reports that the combined Spanish
columns commanded by Colonels Hernan
dez, Frances and Romero, met several
rebel parties under Maceo, near Tombar
del Telrino, and dislodged them from their
positions.
The rebels retired and the Spanish col
umns continued their march. The
Spaniards again found the enemy and a
fierce engagement occurred, resulting in
the rebels being dislodged a second time.
The enemy h'red four cannon shots at
close range.
The column under Colonel Hernandez
returned to Dimas for the purpose of
carrying the wounded to a place where
they could be properly treated.
Colonels Frances and Romero continued
their march and entered the town of
Manajas, which was in possession of the
rebel leaders Brico, Daiz and others.
The enemy made a strong resistance, but
they were routed and driven out of the
town by a bayonet charge, in which the
losses of the rebels were heavy, eight of
their dead having been counted on the
field. The Spanish losses were eleven
killed and a major, a captain and eighty
six privates wounded, forty-six of whom

JACEMEL LAID IN ASHES
For Four Days Fire Raged in
the Jamaica Town, Causing
a Big Loss.
The Damage Estimated at Five Million
Dollars, and Great Destitution
Now Prevails.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct 2.â The
steamer Andes, which arrived this after
noon from Jamaican ports, brings news of
the great fire which destroyed two- thirds
of the town of Jacemel, on September 19,
20 and 21.
At 10 o'clock in the morning the alarm
of fire was given ami every effort was
made at once to have it extinguished.
The fire originated on the hill near the
cathedral and completely destroyed that
edifice. The flames went seaward and
burned all the houses and stores between
the hill and the sea. No water could be
obtained at any time during the fire,
which raged from Saturday morning until
Tuesday night, when the Andes left. On
that night the fire was still smoldering.
The loss sustained is estimated at $5,000,
--000. The fire is supposed to be the work
of an incendiary.
Great destitution prevails, and it is for
tunate that the Ande3 had a large cargo
from New York for that place. This was
landed in time to relieve distress and com
manded a ready sale.

attempt to rob the express-car on the east*
bound- train on the Atlantic and Pacific
road was made by a party of armed men
about 7 o'clock this evening at Rio Puerco,
a little station thirty-four miles west of
Albuquerque consisting of only the sta->
t ion-house and water- tan K. The train
made its usual stop, and just as the order
was given to start a volley was tired by
the robbers, one of the shots putting out
the light in the lantern held by a brake*
man. The engineer was covered by tha
gang and ordered to. climb down and un
couple the express-car.
Tlie express-messenger in charge of the
car, hearing the volley of shots, prepared
for trouble and when the gang appeared
opened fire, letting the bullets go as fast
as a self-cocking revolver could send them.
This demoralized the robbers and they fell
back, firing wildly.
By this time the passengers realised
what was going on. Deputy United States
Marshal Looxnis happened to be on one of
the rear cars and ran forward, reaching the
front of the train just in time to re-enforce
the express-messenger, who was keeping
up his fire.
One of the robbers was left dead on the
road, and it is not known how many oi the
others were injured, though it is believed
that several of them were more or less
wounded. There were seven in all in the
gang.
When the dead man's mask was re
moved he was recognized by Marshal
Loomis as a man named Young, who was
not a novice in crime. He was killed by
the first shot fired by the Marshal, and
when he fell the others broke and ran,
soon taking themselves out of danger, as
the evening was cloudy and very dark.
The members of the gang that Young
associated with are known to the author
ities, and this will be of much service to
the officers in tracking them. The operator
at Rio Puerco sent information of the
affair to the headquarters of the company
here, but, as there is only one railroad
wire to the station, no details could be ob
tained until the arrival of the train at
11:20 p. M.
As soon as the information was received,
Superintendent Walker of the Atlantic and
Pacific made up a special train, and, with
a number of good men and horses, started
for the scene of the trouble as fast as one
of the best engines of the company could
pull him.
The posse was on the trail of the robbers
in less than two hours alter the affair oc
curred.
Rio Puerco station is in the midst of a
barren open country. Very few people
live in the vicinity; it is many miles from
any important settlement, and it will be
almost impossible for the robbers to con
ceal themselves in the country for any
considerable length of time or get out of
the district without being discovered.
This, witn the additional advantage of
having a pretty correct idea of who they
are, by reason of knowing the one who
was shot, and the other fact that at least
two of them are quite severely wounded,
makes it reasonably certain that the'most
of the gang will be captured in a very short
time, and as the law of New Mexico makes
train-robbery a capital offense, this will
probably be their last contract.
Robert Lewis Harris Dead.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 2. â Robert

gineers and of the Institution of Civil
Engineers of Great Britain, died suddenly

Louis Air Line Railway. For forty years
he was actively engaged in railroad work,
either as chief engineeror in construction.

CHEERS FOR McKINLEY
Some Unwelcome Sounds That
Are Net Appreciated at
the Rally.
BRYAN ABUSES HIS OPPONENTS
Also Tries to Justify the Chicago
Platform by Cistirg S urs on
the Supreme Court.
CINCINNATI, Ohio. Oct. 2. âNo
speeches were made by William J. Bryan
between Huntington, W. Va., and Cincin
nati, although he gave explanations along
the route about the necessity for saving
his voice and at one place told the crowd
that he was obliged to go out to talk to
the people because most of the news
papers were against him.
Stops were made by the candidate's
special train at Cattletsburg, Ironton,
Ashland, Greenup, South Portsmouth,
Vancehurg, Maysville, Augusta and Men
tor, all towns in Kentucky along the Ohio
River. At New Portsmouth there was a
big gathering.
Many people came over the river from
New Richmond, Ohio, and gave the can
didate three cheeN on the Kentucky side.
Big crowds at Maysville and Augusta
cheered Mr. Bryan. Many people from
Portsmouth, Ohio, came over the river to
see him at South Portsmouth, and along
the Ohio bank were several people who
viewed the candidate at long range. It
was Mr. Bryan's second visit to Maysville
within a {month. He told about his in
valided voice, and caused a great scramble
in the jam around the train by scattering
a boxful of flowers among his audience.
Augusta furnished a cannon salute.
Congressman McMillan took Mr. Bryan's
place &s speechmaker at nearly every stop.
Congressman Berry introduced the candi
date along the route. The run over the
Chesapeake and Ohio tracks from Hunt
ington to Cincinnati was a record-breaker.
At one time a speed was made that if
maintained would have given seventy
three miles an hour. Twelve miles were
run in nine minutes in one spurt. The
delays caused by stops at stations where
crowds were gathered were made up by
the rapid locomotion.
When Mr. Bryan reached here at 6:30
o'clock to-night he was escorted by tbe
Duckworth Club and other political or
ganizations of the State to the GiDson
House. Considerable enthusiasm was
shown by big crowds along tbe route. A
hasty supper and a quick change of cloth
ing and the candidate was taken to Music
Hall under escort of the Duckworth Club.
Here he was down for a speech, but it was
not the only one he was expected to make.
At Music Hall there were about 10,000
people in the audience. Outside the
streets were jammed by enormous crowds
and all the entrances were besieged by en
thusiasts eaeer for admittance.
Louts Reemelein. chairman of the Demo
cratic County Executive Committee,
called the meeting to order and was
howled down. In self-delense he pre*
sented Mr. Bryan. Gustave Staple, who
had been chosen to preside, came in just
then, and made a speech, which nobody
heard in tbe confusion. He, too, intro
duced Mr. Bryan.
Cries of "Hurrah for McKinley" aroused
the ire of the inmates, and they tried to
find the culprits.
While the shouts and calls were at their
height Otway Grove, president of the
Duckworth Club, jumped up and called
the disturbers blackguards. He demanded
tbe removal of three men in tbe balcony,
and when this was done and the confusion
stopped he presented Mr. Bryan. Having
been so well introduced the Democratic
nominee began his speech without delay.
He said in part:
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: I
.esteem it a privilege as a candidate for ollice
to be presented io the peopie of Cincinnati.
We are compelled to face an enemy in this
campaign which is not only well organized
and well equipped with means both for legiti
mate and Illegitimate work, but we are also
compelled to face an en my which is not
entirely honest in ite dealings with the peo
ple. Before addressing myself t. the para
mount issues of the campaign I want to call
your attention to two or three questions that
have beeu raided by our opponents.
Some of our opponents have attempted to
arraign us before the bar of public opinion
upon the charge that we are trying to disturb
order and to overthrow law. I want for a
moment to meet that proposition There is
nothing in our platform that justifies that
charge. If they tay that our declaration in
favor of any income tax is an attempt to dis
crbdtt the Supreme Court I deny it. There is
nothing in our platform on that subject which
Is bn.it as severe as the minority of the court
itself uttered against the judgment of the
Supreme Court. [Applause.]
Let me call your attention to a criticism
which Abraham Lincoln made of a decision of
the Supreme Court, and when you read his
criticism yon will find hoir far wo fall short of
him in criticism. And yet there are good peo
ple in this country to-day who think that
Abraham Lincoln was not only a great man
but a good man and a patriot. Here is his
language in June, 1857: "We believe at much
as Judge Douglas, more in obedience and re
spect for the Judicial Department of the Gov
ernment; bnt we think that the Dred Scott
decision was erroneous: we know that the
court tnat made it has often overruled its own
decisions, and we shall do what we can to have
it overrule this."
My friends, the position taken by Abrahtm
Lincoln is exactly the position which we take
to-day. [Applause.] We expect that this de
cition at some time in the future shall be over
ruled. We expect that $n this Nation it
will be possible to make wealth pay its share of
the burdens of the Government
I call your attention to the fact that the men
who are criticizing us for still favoring an in
come tax do not criticize the income tax. Our
opponents want you to oeliere that we are op
posed to the enforcement of the law.
So far as that criticism is directed against
me as a candidate I assert, as I have asserted
before, that there is not a citizen in all this
land who believes more thoroughly in the
enforcement of every law upon the statute
books than I do [applause], and, my friends, if
by the suffrages of my countrymen I may be
made the chief executive of this Nation I will
promise you that 1 will so enforce the laws
that some of my critics will come on their
knees begging not to have the laws enforced.
[Tremendous applause.]
Let me state to you a reason for the opposi
tion of some of these railroads which they do
not themselves posses*. They object to our
platform because we demand tiiat instead of
summoning an army to settle labor troubles
thai we shall have arbitration to settle them.
But the worst part of all this opposition is
that tbe men who attempt to destroy labor
organizations and to make the laboring man
defenseless are the men who in this campaign
are attempting to use the votes of laborers
themselves to overthrow their rights. [Great
applause.]
There is another plank that these men ficd
fault with, but they do not say much about it,
and that is the plank which declares against
government by injunction and in favor of the
bill that passed the Senate to protect people
whe are arrested for contempt. Why do they
not criticize that plank? Because tbe bill
which we Indorsed in our platform passed the
Senate of the United States without opposition
enough to secure a roilcall. The biil is just.
It is givinsr the right of trial by jury, and
these men "dare not oppose the justice of the
measure, and therefore they seek some other
excuse upon which to oppose tha principles of
of our platiorin.
Mr. Bryan then rehearsed his familiar
arguments on the money question and
continued:
They say that we nre trying to raise class
against class. I deny it. "We are trying to
arouse the people to protect their homes from
a conspiracy which has no equal in the his
tory oi the world. [Cheers anu applause.]
After his Cincinnati speech Mr. Bryan
left immediately for Covington. arriving
there at 10:30 r. m., and spoke for forty
minutes to a crowd of 8000 people. Hi 3
address was similar to that made in Cin
cinnati. When the meeting was over Mr.
Bryan was taken to the residence of A. P.
Turvin, where he spent the night. He
will leave Cincinnati to-morrow morning
over the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern
railroad for St. Louis.
SPEECHES I N WEST VIRGINIA.
Bryan Talks Loudly About Silver t Trusts
and Syndicates.
CHARLESTON, W. Va., Oct. 2. âThis
morning Bryan began another day of cam
paigning at Point Pleasant, W. Va. He
reached here at (J o'clock. Bryan made a
short speech to 1000 people. Charleston
gave the candidate a hearty reception. The
train arrived at 9:20 a. m. A lone proces
sion escorted the candidate about the
streets and then to the City Park, where
he made a speech.
Ten thousand people composed the audi
ence that heard the candidate. His recep
tion was of the heartiest. Mr. Bryan said
in part:
Ladies and Gentlemen: In this capital of
West Virginia I desire to express my thanks
for the very cordial â welcome which lies heeu
extended to me by the members of the Triple
Alliance. 1 find here upon the platform Demo
crats, Republicans, Populists, members of all
parties, who while differiuÃ among them
selves on minor questions are united in their
determination to restore to the peoi>le of this
country the gold and silver coin of the consti
tution. 1 beiieve that in this campaign we are
entitled to the support of all political parties
who believe still in a government of the peo
ple, by the people and lor the people. We may
differ upon the fundamental principles to the
various questions which arise.
We may differ in opinion upon policies sug
gested by various parties, put my friends,
whenever any party in this Nation denies the
ability of th<; Nation to have such a financial
policy as the American people want to have
the other questions disappear and we stand
united to vindicate the right of self-govern
meut. Those who have been Republicans in
the past, those who have voted the Republican
ticket from the time the party was organized
can find a good excuse for leaving that party
this year. Go back to 1888 and you will find
that the Repub.ican party declared for gold
and silver as standard money and even went
so far as to denounce the Democratic party for
trying to demonetize silver. Read that plat
form adopted by the Republican National
Convention of 1888 and Â»cc how it tried to
turn the indignation of the people against the
Democratic administration because it had
been hostile to silver, and on that platform
the Republican party won the election.
Mr. Bryan maintained that one of the
best evidences that the silver idea was the
correct one was found in the fact that all
great trusts and combines are against the
Democratic ticket. He followed up his old
line of argument and discussed the iaw of
supply and demand as applied to silver.
Another special train was provided by the
West Virginia State Committee for Mr.
Bryan's journey to Huntington.
HUNTINGTON, W. Va., Oct. 22.â 0hi0,
Kentucky and West Virginia contributed
to the throng that heard William J. Bryan
speak here this afternoon. Excursion
trains were ran from a number of places.
Mountaineers came in en horseback and
afoot. People were landed from the river
steamers, and altogether Mr. Bryan had
as picturesque an audience as he has ever
addressed. His hearers numbered, accord
ing to various estimates, between 10,000
and 15,000. Mr. Bryan made a short ad
dress, in which he said:
Yon talk to Republicans about the gold
standard and they will tell you they are as
good friends of the double standard as any
body, and yet when they come to get out
their badge*, when they come to print the
name ol their candidate on paper, they by
some strange circumstances select yellow
paper to print it on. [Cheers and laughter.]
Another thing, you cannot find any clubs
among the Republicans which arc called ROld
staadard clubs. What you do find is the
sound-money club. Now, why do they use
sound money instead of gold? Because they
dare not tell the people what they mean by
the term. They are using these words to de
ceive. My iriends, everybody wants sound
mouey, but the question is, what is sound
money? 1 will tell you what I understand
sound money to be. Sound money is fur
nished in sufficient quantities to form a safe
basis (or the business ot the country.
There is something necessary besides quality
in money. Money may be good, splendid, but
there may be none of it. It is of money as it is
of foodâ you have got to combine quality and
quantity. You must combine quantity and
quality. The gold standard is of no advan
tage unless you can find enough gold to fur
nish the standard money. Our opponents
have not furnished that gold. They cannot
furnish it. All over the world to-day the na
tions are scrambling to get all tnc gold there
is. When they talk about the Invisible sup
ply of gold they talk about the supply which
cannot be seen, because invisible means not
seen, and I will tell you that this invisible
supply of gold is getting more and more in
visible every day. [Applause. l Now, my
friends, there are two reasons which may ex
plain the fact taat our opponents do not pro
pose a financial system to the American people.
In thÂ« first piace, they may Know what is
best. Will they admit that their failure to tell
you what ought to be done is ignorance ? If so,
how can they ass you to trust those who don't
know what the party does not know to-flay?
[Laughter] If our opponents do not know
what kind of a system is good for us, then, if
we should trust them, it would be the blind
leading the blind. And you know what the
Bible says about the blind leading the blind;
they both fell into the dith. If. on the other
hand, our opponents say they know what
ought to be done, then we ask them why they
don't tell the people what they know. Our
opponents can only excuse themselves on one
of two grounds: their failure to elaborate a
financial system must be due to ignorance or
it must be due to an unwiilingnesa to let the
people know what their plans are before giv
ing them their vote. [Applause.]
Mr. Bryan spoke of bankers who grew
rich on the interest of deposits, and added :
And yet these men who act in the capacity
or trustees are so insolent that they are now
contributing to Republican campaign funds
the money that the people have deposited with
them for security. [Applause.] >Iy friends, if
the banks want to go into politics let them
beware of the result that may follow political
banking. If they train to be business men and
run their business on ba.se principles tney
must not come into the field of politics and
attempt to 'run politics. I realize that the
great corporations, trusts, syndicates and com
binations are against us, but I remember that
they were against Andrew Jackson in the same
Ci?ht that we are making to-day. [Applause.]
They were powerful in the press, they were
powerful before the people, but when the time
to vote came the people were greater than the
combination. [Applause.] fiat, my friend?,
this campaign will demonstrate whether the
people are to have a government of the people,
by the people and for the people, or whether
it is to be a government of and for the syndi
cates.
The rest of the speech was devoted to an
explanation of the 53-cent dollar, and to
statements about the impossibility bf the
Mexican dollar in America.
The cavalcade of beplumed men who es
corted Mr. Bryan to the stand fell in line
again and went back to the station with
him. At trie station Governor McCorkie
and the other West Virginians who ac
companied him through the State said
eood-by to Mr. Bryan. Mr. Bryan, Urey
Woods, National committee for Kentucky,
Representative McMillin of Tennessee left
riuntington on the candidate's train for
Cincinnati at 1:10.

Xo<h-st in Their Claims.
CHICAGO, IvÂ», Oct. 2.â The Demo
cratic managers are quite modest in their
claims as to the result of the Goergia
State election, which occurs next week.
They announce that their returns indicate
that the State will be carried by the
Democrats by a safe majority, the mean
ing of which is thus stated:
"It will be remembered that in the
present State campaign in Georgia the
Republicans and Populists have a fusion
ticket in the field, consequently the Demo
crats will have to overcome the united
strength of both parties. The best posted
Democratic leaders in the State say that a
Democratic majority of 15,000 will be a
great victory for Democracy and maybe
accepted as a criterion for a Democratic
majority for Bryan in November of not
less thau 60,000 to 75.000."

Purely Selfish Motives Actuated

Facts Show That the Ex-Chancellor
Caused tbe Demon etiz-tion of

NEW YORK, N. V., Oct 2.â The Hon.
Andrew D. White, writing from Ithaca,
has addressed an open letter to Governor
Culberson of Texas, on the recent Bis
marck campaign document, in the course
of which he says in part:
"You have doubtless already learned that
both yon and Mr. Bryan have been de
ceived regarding the letter of Prince Bis
marck to you, and that the most impor
tant part of it. as first published, is a for
gery, the dishonest translation foisted
upon your Excellency and Mr. Bryan con
taining a long paragraph favoring the im
mediate and independent action of the
United States in favor of bimetallism
which does not exist in the original.
"Of course, I acquit you both of inten
tional deceit, believing you both too high
minded to profit knowingly by this forged
interpolation. But what are the Ameri
can people to think of a cause which re
sorts to such a glaring criminal expedient,
and which has not hesitated to exhibit
you and your candidate in the light of
dupes before 60,000,000 of your fellow-citi
zens?
"But even conceding that tbe letter, with
or without forged interpolation, proves
that Prince Bismarck favor 3 the unlim
ited coinage of silver in the United States,
I respectfully submit that your Excel
lency's confiding application to the Prince
for his opinion on this subject and the use
of his reply made by yourself and Mr.
Bryan is possibly the most farcical event in
American history.
"My reasons for this opinion are as fol
lows: As Minister of the United States to
the German empire in 1879, 1880 and 1881,
I carefully observed the demonetization
of silver in Germany which reached its
consummation during those years. Pos
sibly Mr. Bryan and your Excellency will
be amazed to learn that the controlling
and directing agent in that demonetiza
tion was none other than your kind cor
respondent, Prince Bismarck, himself, at
that time the all-powerful Chancellor of
the German empire.
"Somewhat over iialf of the silver thus
reduced to bullion was sold by the Ger
man Government ; but the prices ran so
low that the sales were stopped and the
German treasury wa3 left with an enor
mous quantity of this depreciated money
in its coffers, amounting, if I remember
rightly, to something over $100, 000,000. A
little of itâ say $2,000,000â Germany man
aged to work off upon poor Egypt under
the Khedive Tewfik, and as Bismarck is
really a patriotic, far-sighted statesman
he would naturally be glad to find a
similar dupe on this side of the Atlantic
and to unload the remainder upon the
United States at say twice its market
value.
"As a simple matter of fact, of which
I was directly and officially cogni
zant, Prince Bismarck utterly declined to
take part in any general scheme of
bimetallism without the co-operetion of
Great Britain, though the United States
and France jointly and officially united in
urging it upon his Government.
"Prince Bismarck is, first of all, as
many of his victims besides your Excel
lency and Mr. Bryan have sad occasion to
know, a great German patriot, devoted
above all things to German interests as he
understands them. Hence it was he who
demonetized Bilver and brought Germany
on a gold basic; and for the same patriotic
reasons which are now leading the great
Russian Minister of Finance, Mr. de
Witte, to do the same thing. Hence it
was, too, that Prince Bismarck did Ins
best to exclude from Germany our Ameri
can agricultural products, and hence,
doubtless, it is that be shows his German
patriotism by obligingly suggesting to
you, and through you to the American
people, a policy which would profit Ger
many to the amount of about fifty mil
lions of dollars, to Bay nothing cf ihe
comfortable profits to the German bullion
brokers.
"If you think that the ex-Chancellor
writes you in an affectionate spirit toward
Democracy, or toward the United States
in general, permit rue to suggest that you
ask your respected Texas fellow-citizen,
Mr. Lasker, for his opinion on this sub
ject. He will, perhaps, give information
of which your Excellency seems to be
strangely ignorant, respecting the treat
ment oi the resolutions of the United
States Congress regarding â¢ Mr. Lasker's
eminent brotherâ resolutions which ema
nated from a Texan member of that body,
and which were spurned and returned to
the United States contemptuously by the
great German statesman.
"How a Governor of Texas could, in a
crisis like this, ask the advice of a foreign
statesman who had thus grossly insulted
his State and country utterly passes my
comprehension; and how a candidate for
the Presidency of tbe United States could
quote with approval such a letter from a
man who has thus treated his country is
equally astonishing. For Prince Bis
marck as the statesman and patriot I
have profound respect, but he has always
held Democratic and Republican govern
ment in contempt."

CONSTANTINOPLE, Ttjbkey, Oct. I.â
An irade has been hsued by the Porte
ordering the formation of a flotilla of ten
torpedo-boats to defend the Dardanelles.
This movement is in conformity with
the advice of the Russian General Tschi

Odessa, who some time in July last in
spected the defenses of the Dardanelles.
Letters received here from Kharput give
terrible details of the massacre which
recently occurred at Eguin, in the Khar

now selling at $15, and a further advance
in value is expected. The greater portion
of the gold producing territory is within
the domain claimed by Venezuela.

PORTLAND GIRL'S CHARGE
Intimates That Her Parents Are
Responsible for Her Lover's
Disappearance.
Jennie Meicher's Story of the Possible
Fate of Youn; William
Auldinger.
PORTLAND, Ob., Oct. 2.â The Jennie
Melcher conspiracy case, insignificant as
it originally was, daily develops new and
startling circumstances. With the addi
tion to-day of May Mabon's confession,
the case becomes extraordinary and in
volves a history of probable crime that de
mands investigation. The girl's story in
volves the mysterious disappearance of
William Aaldinger, a young man who
worked on his stepfather's farm, and who
had been her warm friend since she was 13
years old.
Miss McMahon says that, when she was
13 years of age, H. L. Melcher one day at
tacked her. Auldinger came to her rescue,
which engendered her stepfather's bitter
est hatred for him. From this circum
stance sprang up the warmest and purest
affection between the boy and girl, which
was opposed by May's mother and
Melcher. They made arrangements to
elope on tbe 22d of July, 1894, but the plan
was frustrated by her unnatural mother.
**T he last time I saw Auldinger," said
the girl, "was on the 18th of July of that
year. Some neighbors told me that be
had been shot. What makes me think
that Melcher did away with the boy was
because he said he would 'fix him' on tbe
day I intended to elope. I afterward
wrote to Willies mother, bnt she had
never seen him since nor heard from
him."
Later she found some things on the
farm belonging to Auldinger which she
knew he was in the habit of carrying
about in his pockets. This circumstance
strengthened her belief that barm bad be
fallen him. She was so thoroughly im
pressed with that theory that she dug up
the soil in various parts of tbe farm ex
pecting to find her young lover's body,
bnt in vain.
It is hinted that the Melchers had more
potent reasons for getting Auldinger out
of the way than merely because he essayed
to elope with Mat. It was about that
time that Mrs. Meicher's house, near Car
son City, was burned. Upon it was an
insurance policy for $2000. Toll Thomp
son, the agent for the insurance company
insuring it, after making careful investi
gation, came to the conclusion that it was
a case of arson and refused to pay the
loss. It is believed by some that Aaldinger
knew something about the origin of that
fire. Agent Thompson secured the legal
services of Gordon E. Hayes of Oregon
City in the Melchcr fire case, and Hayes,
after much negotiating, offered Mrs.
Melcher several hundred dollars for her
policy rather than subject the company to
a lawsuit. The offer was refused.
In September, 1894, Mrs. Jennie Melcher
caused the arrest of Thompson and Hayes
on charges of intimidation and attempted
extortion. The men had a preliminary
hearing before Justice Geisler and were
discharged, but, despite their judicial ex
oneration, there were not a few who con
tinned to believe in Mrs. Melcber's story
of persecution.
ROBBED BY HIGHWAYMEN
John Carr, a Lumber-Dealer,
Held Up and Relieved
of $500
Fought Desperately Until Sutduei
by Having a Pistol Pressed
Ag3inst Him.
WEST HAVERSTRAW, N. V., Oct.
2.â John Carr, a lumber-dealer of Long
Island City, had a desperate fight with
two highwaymen in this city at 8:30
o'clock last evening, and as a result of his
encounter he lost $5000. Carr had been
making collections at Bridgeport, and
had quite a sum when he came to this
place.
He had collected $2640 on a check and
started for the station at about 8:30 o'clock
to catch the 9 o'clock train for New York.
He says he was walking rapidly along the
street when, just as he came to a dead wall,
two robbers, one a negro and one a white
man, stepped out of the shadow and one
of them said : "Give up or we'll kill you."
The lumber-deaJer is plucky and he de
termined to tight for his money. He
grappled with tbe robbers and was mak
ing it interesting for them, when the negro
stepped back, and drawing a revolver
pressed it against his head. Then Carr
surrendered. The white man took his
wallet while the negro held the pistol to
his chest. After they bad secured their
booty the white man said: "If you utter a
word until we are out of sight we will re
turn and kill you."
Then the robbers fled in the darkness.
When last seen they were going north,
and it is thought took a West Shore train
at a way station. Carr made his way to
the station, where he told bis story. Tbe
police were at once notified, but the lum
ber-dealer was so badly frightened that he
could not give a good description of his
assailants. The place was so dark at
which he was held up, he said, that he
could scarcely see. but he is sure that one
of nis assailants was white and tbe other a
nesrro.
The Chief of Police at one wired to all
tbe near-by towns asKinjr them to keep a
lookout for the men. Carr believes that
the robbers must have been watching him
until he was making his collections here,
and it is thought that he incautiously dis
played his money while doing so.

"JOBS" from all parts of the world.
The result of two weeks' steady labor
by five vof our best buyers. 165
'â¢JOBS" displayed. in our big front
show-windowâ three times as many
throughout the store. Merchants
call "JOBS' ' the sweetmeats of trade.
It means the class of goods ' that Im-
porters, Manufacturers or Jobbers
sell at a positive and acknowledged
loss. They tell you so frankly and
your eyes record the truth. It means
to you buying merchandise at 50c or
less 'on the $1 of their marketable
value. They come from the auction
room, the ~. already and intending
bankrupt. They are given up by the
distressed needy and tottering mer-
chant,' who pays dearly for an oppor-
tunity to prolong mercantile life.
Few merchants have coin. We al-
ways ' have. We buy and sell x for
coin. We have goods or money, and
always ready to buy any job offered.
But our friends along the line have it
in their looks or in the fixtures. It's
dullâ very dullâ that's what makes
"JOBS"â why we have them.
But we want to whoop it up and
make room for more. Come and see
this sale to-day. You'll save many
a half dollar on a dollar's worth if
you do.

FROM ZANZIBAR
Said Khalid Escapes the
Vigilance of Great

Fiood Tide.
PROTEST OF THE ENGLISHMEN
Regarded as an Unfriendly Act, but No

ZANZIBAR, Oct. 2.â Khalid, who on
August '26 proclaimed himself Sultan of
Zanzibar after the death of Sultan Hamid
Bin Thwain and took refuge in the Ger
men Consulate after the bombardment
and destruction of the palace ; y British
warships on August 28, has been spirited
away by the Germans despite the British
re-iue.it for his surrender.
At the extreme flood of the tide when
the water was almost level with the Ger
man Consulate, which is at .the waterside,
Khalid was conveyed on board the Ger
man warsloop Seeadler under the protec
tion of a guard of German sailors.
Tlie Germans did not notify the British
nuthorities of their intention to rem >ye
Khalid from the Consulate, nor did they
inform the British of the fact that his re
moval had been accomplished.
When i heÃriiish Consul learned of the
affair through other sources, he made a
vig rous piOtest, which has not yet been
answered by the German Consular
authorities.
LONIMN, Eng., Oct. 2.â The Standard
will to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Berlin saying it is stated that Germany
notified Great Britain some days ago of
her intention to transfer Said Khalid to
German East Africa. Some of the Lon
don newspapers publish editorials de
nouncing the transfer of Said Khalid from
the German Consulate as an unfriendly
act, but they declare that Great Britain
will be glad to get rid of him.
NAPA SUSPECT'S TALE,
William Moore Says He Falsely
Confessed to a Murder in
Lieu of Suicids.
Sought Death by Lynching Rather
Than Become His Own
Executioner.
NAP A, Cal., Oct. 2.â William Moore,
the self-confesÃed murderer of Mrs. John
Q. Greenwood, now says that he did not
commit the crime with which he is
charged. Moore made a long rambling
statement to-day in court, claiming in
effect that he had said he was the mur
derer because of a desire to .die and be
cause be did not want to commit suicide.
He thought that after an open confession
of the crime he would be brought to Napa
and speedily lynched. The court has ap
pointed John York and C. J. Beeratecher
as his attorneys. In his statement Moore
avid:
I have been troubled with not sleeping and
have been using drugs and I am broke up
otherwise, and hard Limes and everything put
together, life became most unbearable.
1 saw in reading the papers anil reading of
the trial prior to this, when the "otner man' 1
was arrestedâ this man Schmidt â tliat I was
the man that they were lookine forâ looking
for a man by the name of Moore. WeU, that
worried me some, but I never concealed my
self- I was always around; used to be in the
saloon business and driving over the city of
Los Angtles nearly every day. I was in Los
Ange.tb, Monica, San Fernando and
some other little towns, but I never came
here.
Well, in the last two yearsâ here, it's a serious
thing io speak ofâ the last two years 1 have
been conicmrdaiing suicide every day; had
beeu feeling like it and hard times ana
despondency, and everything like that was
new to me; I studied about it nights and
thought a good deal about it and at times it
ntiurly drove me crazy, of course, thinking
about the means I would get shut off mys;lt
â¢witn. Then I started and wrote out a history
of mysell to kill time of uighu. i could not
sleep and so to occupy m>self some way I
wrote out a history; I don't" bay whether it is
a iictitiuus History or not, perhaps it is a
fictitious history, anyway I wrole out a his
tory. After I got tne history about finished I
came to this conclusionâ l believe I got that
wrote out in the history about tome items in
itâ then ihat came into my mind.
Wiiy m.t give myseii ur>? Why not picture
myseU as ulack as the wa is of the lower
region; get all the punishment and take all
blame on mys It attached io it, unicu I uid
down in Los Augeles? I may have tried to
commit suicide with v jug <>f prisonâ thought
it was poison. I told a party that I had com
mitted tuis deed, and along the road I made
your Sheriff think I had done it, too, and
everybody ulse.
The motive? I supposed when I got here
that they would get me out of the way pretty
quick; get my body on the other side oi the
nver and my soul ai. rest. Like that I reck
oiu-d, but I reckoned too hasty.
1 found tne people oi Napa Cityâ a people
that are educated uud peop.e that ieasou and
p-ople that would sooner settle things by arbi
tration than tne sword â not so hasty as I
wished them to be. May think lam insane;
perhaps I am insane; I can't be very much
becauie I uon't feei mat way. They so call a
man that commits suicideâ he is insane. You
pick up the papers and here to-day you see
three or four people through the United States
committing suicideâ sometimes men "well to
do" commit suicide when they get cramped
for money, and I ara uo exception. AnJ I
thought aboui it aad aimost fell ihat way; but
I says, I was raised by educated people. I -.vag
raised by Christian parents, adopted parents,
who says that when h man puts his hands on
his own life had commuted almost an unpar
doi.at.le^sin; 1 believe it is right; I believe in
a he.l and a heaven and I believe in the re
wards good and badâ owing to how you con
duct yourself in this world.
Continuing, Moore said that he had
met a man resembling him in San Fran
cisco, and afterward learned that it was
because of this resemblance that he him
self was suspected of the Greenwood
murder. Meeting the fellow later, he
Patented to know all about the killing,
and his companion, becoming intoxicated,
confessed that he had killed Mrs. Green
wood, and described the murder in detail.
The stranger said three men were impli
cated m the crime. Moore learned all of
the details, and when he had resolved
upon ending bis life he wrote the confes
sion, believing that it would soon bring
him to the gallows.

SANTA CRUZ SETTLERS WIN.
Decision Rendered Against the Depeaux
Heirs in the Soguei Augmen
tation Suit.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Oct. 2.-The cele
brated Depeaux case, involving Soquel
land of 40,000 acres to the value of $2,000,
--000, in wliich Elizabeth Peck asked for
levers of administration, was decided in
the Superior Court by Judge Logan to-day
adversely to the plaintiff. The decision
was a very lengthy one, and terminates
litigation in which 600 settlers were in
volved. They are now secured in their
titles.
In 1850 and 1855 Martina Castro Depeaux
conveyed by deeds 40,000 acres of land
known as the Soquel Augmentation and
San Andreas ranchos, in the center of
Santa Cruz County. These deeds passed
into the hands of three persons, and alter
many vicissitudes the land is now held by
over 600 owners in subdivisions, and the
towns of Soquel and Caoitola and the vil
lages of Apios, Valencia and Olive Springs
form "part of the great improvements ef
fected upon these ranchos. For forty
years the title remained clear and no con
test was offered, but in November, 1896,
Miss Mary Elizabeth Peck of Santa Cruz,
representing the children of the deceased
Martina Castro Depeaux, instituted suit
for the granting of letters of administra
tion upon the estate. Tne case aroused
intense interest in this section of the
county, and eminent counsel were re
tained on each side.
Solano*s Sugar-Beet Industry.
SUISUN, Cal., Oct 2. â Sugar beets
were planted as an experiment through
out Solano County last spring. Samples
of some have been tested this week, and
the returns exceed the nio3t sanguine un
ticipations of the growers. The sugar in
dustry is regarded as the comin â .â¢ one, and
efforts will be made to establish a factory
in the most convenient location in the
county. Beets from Dixon went as high
as 16 per cent for sugar, and a sample
from Suisun 20 per cent for sugar and 88
per cent purity of juice. All the farmers
are interested in the movement and active
steps will be taken to make the industry a
permanent one.

Ex-Governor. Brown "Does" Europe

Ex-Governor Brown of Maryland is ar

he can speak no language except English,

Baltimore American. ; Said he: ; "1 have
found that there is but one safe rule in
traveling abroad, and that is to imitate the .

"In my former travels I made it a point
to get my trunk checked through, or regis

on that trunk. "â  When 1 saw the baggage
man out my trunk on a carl at once got
into that train and: took ; a ; forward : seal,

Whenever I saw the baggageman take my
trunk out of the car I got off. , In this way
I never made a mistake, though I could
not speak the language of the country I
was traveling in and bad no interpreter. \~

Cloudburst
LOSS OF LIFE FEARED.
Wires Are Leveled by the Deluge
and the Inhabitants' Fate
Is Unknown.
BENSON'S LONG LIST OF DEAD.
Bodies of Two of the Victims of Thurs
day's Disaster RecoveredâRail
way Tracks Washed Away.
TUCSON, Abiz., Oct. 2.â A report has
jnst been received here that a cloudburst
at Bisbee has washed out nearly the en
tire town, which is located in a narrow
canyon. The wire* are down, and the re
port cannot be verified, but a serious dis
aster is feared, as the canyon is very nar
row and there is little chance of escape
from the flood. At Bisbee is located the
Copper Queen's works.
It was learned late to-night that there
was a serious washout on the Southern
Pacific at Steins Pass.
The wires between here and Benson
were down all day and but meazer news
of the cloudburst disaster of yesterday
has been received. The latest informa
tion is that Mrs. Ashburn and her chil
dren and Mrs. Zeek and two children were
drowned. The bodies of the mothers
were recovered, but those of the children
have not yet been foun d. Four Mexicans
are missing, and are supposed to have
been carried down by the flood.
The destruction to property was consid-
erable. Some light frame buildings went
to pieces like eggshells when the torrent
â truck them. There was a heavy hail
storm in connection with the flood, which
added to the damage.
This is the moit damaging flood that has
ever visited Southern Arizona and most
serious in its consequences. The railroad
sustains serious loss, and trains will not
be running regularly for several days.
EUREKA EDITOR'S DEATH,
A. J. Wiley Passes to the Beyond
Alter an Illness of Two
Weeks.
Was a Leader in Every Movement
for the Advancement of His
County.
EUREKA, Cal., Oct 2.â A. J. Wiley,
editor of the Humholdt Times, passed
away in tbis city this morning after an
illness of two weeks. He had been ailing
for the greater part of last month and two
weeks ago he was forced to take to his bed
with what was then diagnosed as Inflam
matory rheumatism. From that time his
condition gradually grew worse, his ail
ment developing into pneumonia. This
was complicated by heart troubles, and
several days ago his physicians announced
that there were no hopes for his recovery.
Last nil- lit he began to sink and at 8:40
o'clock this morning, in a delirium of sick
ness, he breathed his last.
Augustus Jacoby Wiley was the eldest
child of pioneers Austin Wiiey and wife
of Arcata and was born in that town, then
known as Union, on January 18. 1857.
Part of his youth was spent in San Fran
cisco, where he received his education,
but most of his life was passed in Hum-

boldt, where he has lived since attaining
majority. Through bis father, one of the
pioneer journalists of the coast and who
in tue early sixties was proprietor of the
San Francisco Call, he early became
identified with the newspaper business
and had been connected with the Hum
boldt Times, in various capacities under
different managements, since 1882.
He was always prominently ideiitined
with Republican politics and under the
Harrison administration he held the office
of Receiver of the United States Land
Office here. At the close of his term he
accepted the editorial chair of the Hum
boldt Times, which be held for three
and a half years. He was one of Hum
boldt's most progressive and enterprising
young men and as such was a valuable
member of the Chamber of Commerce, of
which body he was secretary for one term.
To his remarkable executive ability are
due in great measure the success of recent
events that tended to the advancement
and advertisement of Eureka, notably the
Sequoia carnival.
An ardent sportsman, Editor Wiley la
bored faithfully for the preservation of
tne county to those who, like himself,
loved the pleasun s of field and stream,
and through his untiring efforts, despite
the antagonism of some of his fellow
sportsmen, he succeeded in securing the
passage of many laws for the protection
of game. The wisdom of these laws and
the honesty of his motives are now ad
mitted by former antagonists.
Besides his parents he leaves some near
relatives â Mrs. O. D. Stern of this city,
wife of the County Clerk, and Mrs. C. B.

residing in San Jose. The funeral will
take place on Sunday in Arcata, under the

SAN JOSE MONGOL'S CRIME.
Wong Oy Took a Chinawoman's Life to
Square a Debt Against Her
Husband.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 2.â The police are
in possession of information which fixes
the murder of Hoy Doy, the Chinese
woman who was killed Tuesday night in-
Sixth-street C inatown, upon Wong Oy.
Two Chinese who were in the woman's
house smoking opium at the time of the
murder have been found and they swear
they saw Wong Oy enter the door of the
room occupied by the woman and fire four
shots.
Wong Oy has disappeared from China
town and no trace of him can be found.
The evidence found by the police has
been turned over to the District Attorney
and a warrant will be issued for Wong
Oy's arrest.
The murder of the woman was evidently
committed to square a debt of $600 which
Wong Wing, the murdered woman's hus
band, owe d Wong Oy. Some time ago
Wong Wing borrowed $600 from Wong
Oy and the latter was given a Chinese
woman known as Sing Yew as security
for the loan. Sing Yew lived with Wong
Oy but a few d ays, when she left him.
She then stole the $600 from Wong Wing
and went to Marysville, where she now is.
WongOy had made several demands upon
Wong Wing for the money, and about a
week ago the latter went to Marysville to
try to collect it from Sing Yew. While
there Wong Wing wrote a letter to Wong
Oy saying he was unable to get it. It is
believed that this so angered the latter
that he decided to kill Hoy Doy to square
ihe debt.

Parties of Men Sent Forth to Fight
the Flamesâ Nirrow Escapes
From Death.
Los Angeles Office of the Call,]
328 South Broadway, >
Los Angeles. Cal., Oct. 2. )
With irresistible fury the forest fires on
the slopes of the Sierra Madre, east and
north of Pasadena, are sweeping toward
Mount Lowe. A cloud of smoke hovered
over this city this afternoon, through
which the sun's rays but dimly pene
trated, producing a weird, red glare.
Ashes fell in profusion, and considerable
apprehension was expressed on the streets
as to the safety of Echo Mountain House
and other property of the Mount Lowe
Railroad Company. Word received by
telephone late this evening from that
famous mountain resort was that the dan
ger was past, the lire going to the north
and east, but with increased fury.
A strong ocean wind is forcing the tire
to the eastward very rapidly through
some of the finest pine forests in the
State. Several sawmills and thousands of
dollars' worth of lumber have been con
sumed. The lire is now approaching the
head of the San Gabriel River, in the di
rection of Old BaHy, and seems destined
to do irreparable damage to the forests of
that region. Switzers Camp, a well
known resort, has been destroyed. Rob
ert Waterman, its owner, and a moun
taineer named Guy Bisbee had a narrow
escape for their lives this afternoon.
The center of the great conflagration,
which is rive miles wide, is near the head
of the Grand Canyon. At 5 o'clock this
afternoon the fire had reached the east
fork of t.e Arroyo Seco. The flames can
be seen from elevated points in Pasadena
and vicinity. Leading citizens of Pasa
dena have appealed to Mayor Rader of
this city to assist in driving the flames
from the great watershed for both cities.
Thirty men were sent out from Pasadena
this afternoon to do what they could to
stay the fames and care for property in
the line of the devastating element.
There is an unbroken line of forest tim
ber in front of the fire line extending to
Little Creek in San Bernardino County, a
distance of about forty miles, and in the
present stage of the wind this region is
likely to be traversed before the fire
abates.
RACED FOR IESIK LIVES.
â Narrow Escape of Two Men From Burn
â  ing ' Switmers ' Camp.
PASADENA. Cal., Oct. 2. âR. V 7.
Waterman and Guy; Bis bee arrived from
the sc ne of the mountain fire and report
that they, barely escaped with their lives,
leaving Switzers Camp doomed to flames.
They raced for four miles through ' suf
focating smoke and flames before getting
out of danger.
The fire is now burning over a swath
several miles wide, licking up all vegeta
tion. It is on the south Bide of East Fork
Arroyo and : in Little -Bear ' Canyon, work
ing toward Mount Lowe. / v On account of
the variableness of the winds and the fact
that each canyon has a strong draught of
its own; it is \ impossible to foretell which
way it will go. v Pasadena' three water
companies sent up about thirty men and
three , teams . to fight ; the fire, - and more
will follow. i At times during t the - day
flames ; could .be seen from Pasadena and
volumes of heavy smoke obscured the sky
to the north.
RECEPTION TO GENERAL MILES.
Citizens of Los Angeles Greet the Com-

States Arm/.
LOS ANGELFS, Cal., Oct 2.â The re
ception given to General Nelson A.
Miles this afternoon at the Chamber of
Commerce was a delightful affair m every
respect. The spacious parlors of the
Chamber were beautifully decorated for
the occasion with flowers, smilax and
potted plants, under the supervision of
Secretary Willard and Mr. Wiggins.
It was arranged that Major E. F. C.
Klokke, D. Freeman and Captain Gilbert
E. Overton should escort the distinguished
guest from the station to the Chamber.
The large reception committee, composed
of leading citizens and business men from
both the Chamber of Commerce and Mer
chants' Association, was promptly on
hand, and the reception- began at 3 o'clock,
when General Miles arrived.
A Ur :e number of ladies and gentlemen
availed themselves of the opportunity to
do honor to the commander of the United
States Army, and he saw among them
many old friends and acquaintances. The
reception was of a distinctly informal
character, and light refreshments were
served during the afternoon.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 2.â lf all the
sign*- .io not fail, the murder of the great
man among the Chinese, Wong Chee, a
few weeks ago in this bity by members of
a nval tong is soon to 1m avenged. AJ
ready the police have beer.: notified. The
information comes from two of ihe best
informed merchants of the Chinese quar
ter, bince the successor of Wong Chee
came down from San Francisco, acti7e
preparations have been made by the Wong
Chee Toug for a battie, during which all
the members of the Bing Ong Tong were
to be exterminated.
Each member of the former tong was as
sessed, and this fund has been expended,
so it is said, for arms and ammunition.
Provisions have been stored in various
places around the quarter, and a mobili
zation has been going on. The result is
that several of the huts are arsenals.
When spoken to about it this afternoon
Chief of Police Glass said that a prolonged
riot would be impossible, as he could
within an hour place a squad of twenty
four men armed with Winchesters in the
town.
ENGLAND'S ALASKA GRAB.
Yukon Miners Resent the Levying of
Tribute by Mounted Police
of Canada.
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 2.â C. A. Car
penter, newspaper man and mine operator,
who lias been in Alaska off and on for
two years, returned to Seattle on the
steamship Al-Ki this afternoon. He re
ports that British mounted police under
command of Captain Constantino are
levying flagrant tribute upon American
citizens and aggressively encroaching on
United States territory at Forty-Mile, on
the Yukon. According to his claim, which
is also that of the entire Yukon mining
population, the British line has been ex
tended fifteen miles southward upon Uncle
Sam's soil. Wnether rightfully or wrong
fully, bluecoats in the name of her Majesty
are collecting a $15 per annum head tax
or license from all miners within the dis
puted district.
In addition to this, Carpenter says high
duties must be paid upon all American
goods going into the town of Forty-Mile.
The miners are very much dissatisfied,
Carpenter avers, over the action of the
British authorities in thus levying tribute,
as well as chagrined at the alleged apathy
of the Federal Government in the
premises, and be believes serious trouble
sooner or later between the British soldiery
and citizen miners is inevitable.
BUCKLEY'S DREAM
WHS SHORT-LIVED
Rainey Captures the Popu
list Legislative Con-
vention.
The "Push" on Hand to See the
Bones From the Whited
Sepulcher.
A CLOUDBUBST FOR SURPRISES
The Last of Its "Purity" Dispelled by
Its Assembly and Senatorial
Nominations.
At the continuation of the Populist con
vention last night at 1159 Mission street it
was seen that Sam Rainey had combined
with Chris Buckley to absorb the party.
To the real simon-pure Populists it was
gall and bitterness to see the principles to
which they were loyal dragged in the dust
by political tricksters.
Buckley's skillful hand manipulated the
municipal convention. Cator just rolled
up the bottoms of his Populist trousers
and waded out to where the "Blind Devil"
sat in his little throne in the political
slough and said: "Chris, send me to Con
gress and my party is yours." Chris
promised and the party was his.
But a change came over the spirit of
Gator's dreams. Either he feared that he
bad fallen in the eyes of his own party or
Buckley "turned him down" â an old
trick, by the way, aa Lieutenant Rainey
can well attest.
So last night the so-called Populists,
who were no longer bipeds, but Buckley
lambs, experienced a spasmodic revulsion
of feeling. The pnblic had declared that
they had been swallowed by Buckley.
They would show the public that they
bad not.
They were unselfish, these politicians.
They would pour balm on Boss Rainey s
wounded heart and make him a happy
man. They did it by nominating nearly
a 1 Junta men for the Assembly and State
Senate.
For this purpose they went into ex
ecutive session, and the result of this
spasmodic revulsion of feeling is attested
by the following nominees:
For the Senateâ Seventeenth District, Sam
Braun hart (Junta); Nineteenth District, Lau
rence J. Dwyer (Junta); Twenty-first District,
Hugo K. Ascher (Junta); Twenty-third Dis
trict, Sidney Hall (Junta); Twenty-fifth Dis
trict, John Fay (Buckley).
For the Assemblyâ Twenty-eighth Dlitrict,
Eugene F. Lacey tJunta); Twenty-ninth Dis
trict, John Allen (Junta); Thirtieth District,
Eugene J. Harmon (Junta); Thirty-first Dis
trict, T. J5. Treacy (Buckley) ; Thirty -second
District, J. D. Powers (Junta); Thirty
third District, E. J. Crane (Buckley);
Thirth-fourth District,. Robert Fay (Pop.);
Thirty-fit th District, Lawrence J. Dolan
(Junta); Thirty-sixth District, H. McGrath
(Junta); Thirty - seventh District, H. I.
Mulcreavey (Junta); Thirty-eighth District,
P. Goldstone (Buckley); Thirty-ninth District,
J. 8. Wardell (Junta); Fortieth District, C. S.
Rosener (Buckley); Forty-first District, Frank
A. Schmitz (Juuta); Forty-second District,
E. J. Reynolds (Buckley); Forty - third
District, George M. Rubens tein (Junta); Forty
iourth District, Gabriel Nathan (Bucklev);
Forty-fifth District, Felix Mulgrew (Buckley).
During the whole of the convention the
halls and corridors were crowded with the
Buckley and the Rainey "push."
T. Carl Spelling hit into a clever scheme
to itarn what was going on by guiding
several of his companions into a room
wnere part of the proceedings could be
heard through the keyhole.
"Hang it, boys," he whispered, "they
are turning us down for Rainey at every
lap."
At this there was a concerted groan.
The news came to Sam Braunhart where
he was stationed buttonholing delegates
who emerged for liquid refreshments to
learn how his candidacy was making it.
The taciturn Samuel smiled from ear to
ear. This was indeed heavenly news.
But the Populists, so called for distinc
tion from the rest of the "push," acre
happy.
They freely stated that the public now
would not know where they "were at."
Thus perishes the Populist party in San
Francisco. Its banner of "purity" is
draggled in the mud.
Greater London's 6,000,000 People.
The result of the census of inner Lon
don, taken on the night of Sunday, March
20 last, shows that the population at that
date was 4,411,271, or some 14,000 lea than
had been estimated. An examination of
the returns shows that the population
north and south of the Thames was thus
divided: North of the river, 2,668,475, and
south of the river 1,642,796. This census
being under the provisions of the equali
zation of rates act, 1894. was co a fined to
the "Administrative County of London.''
"Greater London," however, includes all
the districts under the jurisdiction of the
metropolitan police. This outer ring in
cludes the county of Middlesex and parts
of the counties of Kent, Surrey, Essex and
Herts, practically all the suburbs of LonÂ«
don. The population of ttie metropolis
in this larger sense is estimated thus: In
ner London, 4,411,271, and Outer London,
1.756,421, a grand total of 6,167,692. Prob
ably the next few years will see a great
change in ihe relative populations of In
ner and Outer London. The development
of the suburban railway systems and the
growing use of the cycle help the move
ment which makes the heart of L >nclon
more and more a business center during
the day and a solitude at night. â London

The Point of View.
A certain eminent physician went to a
concert at his wife's earnest request,
though he has no knowledge of or interest
in music. He was rather listless until one
of the singers, a lady, rose and Began to sine
for the first time. Then he brightened up.
"Who is that alto?" he asked.
"Alto!" exclaimed bis wife. "That isn't
alto. She's a high soprano, and her name
is Jones."
"Hum !" ssid the doctor.
"Why? Do you like her voice?"
"Can't say much tor her voice, but she
has one of the finest bronchitises that I
ever encountered." â Youtii's Companion.

Parties.
POPULISTS IN TROUBLE.
Attorney â¢ General Fitzgerald's
Opinion on State Ticket
Filings.
MUST NAME ANOTHER HAN.
McGlashan's Successor to Be En
rolled Only by Petitionâ Gold
Democrats Victorious.
SACRAMENTO, Cat,., Oct. 2.âAttor
ney-<;eneral Fitzgerald has rendered an
opinion that Marion de Yries' name can
not be pinccil o>\ the State ticket as the
fusion nominee for Congress in the Second
District.
J. M. Landsboroush, a candidate for
Assembly in the Twenty-third â¢ District,
this afternoon inquired of Secretary of
State Brown if the Populist State Central
Committee would be allowed to tile a cer
tificate of De Yries' nomination by the
Popnlist i?taie Central Committee, and
received an answer in thÂ« negative. At
Landsborou.ih'* request, however, Brown
telegraphed to the Attorney-General for a
legal opinion, and to-night received an
nnswer upholding his decision. The opin
ion was to the effect that the certificate
must be filed not less than forty days he
ft.re election, and ii founded on tection
119l> of the Political Code.
Thrb leave* the nomination resigned by
C. P. McGlashan vaciinf, unless before 12
o'clock to-morrow evening a petition is
tiled in the interest of some nominee. The
petition must have ISSO names.
Secretary of State Brown has refnreJ the
request of Senator Alford that no certifi
cates of nomination of electors styling
themselves Democratic or similarly be
filed other than of the Bryan electors.
Brown cites section IW2 of "the Political
Code as the only authority bearing on the
subject, holding that similarity of mime
not being cited in this section as one of
the causes why certificates should not be
filed he has no power to refuse. He vol
unteers tbe suggestion that the injury
does not arise irom the fact of the certifi
cate being on iile, but rather because the
nominees are certitied to by the county
clerks as provided in section 1193, Political
Code.
LORDS "OLD MAN ELOQUENT"
Rev. J. W. Brii-r Will Preach the Gospel
of Protection for American*.
LODI, Cal., Oct. 2.-Rev. J. W. Brier,
82 years old, will stamp this section of the
State for McKinley and prosperity.
Though laden with years and hoary
headed the old gentleman is once more
determined to taks up the cause of the
American -worklngman and spread the
truth among his fellows.
"I never was no much interested as at the
present time," says he, "for I see the
danger in a clear lieht."
Rev. J. W. Brier was born in Dayton,
Ohio, on October 14, 1814. He is of Scotch
parentage, the lamily name bein.z
orinally MacÃriar. Ephraim MacÃriar of
Scott's "Old Mortality" is claimed as one
of the family ancestors. The old gentle-
REV. J. W. BRIER.
man's father was a. Whig of the strictest
ncuool- ;i lineal descendant of the old
Federal partyâ and his eight sons were
early immersed in the pool of Wuigery.
Mr. Brier was reared in the corntiekls
of Ohio and Indiana and developed a
strong physical constitution, which has
borne him through the many years with
a wonderful strength, ho to-day carrying
himself as straight as a young man. Ha
learned the bncKtnason's trade, but at 21
shook off the brick dust for a college pol
ishing. He studied for tne Presbyter.'an
ministry, but not being abla to indorse
Calvinism became a Methodist itinerant,
laboring for twenty years in that body.
He has for twenty years been connected
with the Congregational church and has
been in the ministry fifty-seven years.
Leaving the Knst he, with his wife and
party, came across the plains and were of
the number composing; the famous Death
Valley party in 1849. The aged couple
have been married fifty-six years.
Rev. Mr. Brier is a charter member of
the Republican party of California, and
knows no compromise. Thinking and
studying deeply is one of his delights, and
bis thoughts tind ready utterance, he being
a rentable "Old Man Eloquent." During
many campaigns he has stumped the
State for hi* party, having made the
welkin ring for Blaiue, Gartield, Harrison,
and, further back, for Grant, Lincoln and
others.
BAKF.RSFIBLD>H BIG PARADE.
Free Trade and Protection Contrasted by ,
Means of Floats.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Oct. 2.â Senator
George C. Perkins and Congressman W.
W. Bowers addressed a monster open-air
meeting here this evening. It was one of
the largest crowds that ever assembled at
any public Catherine in the history of the
city. Close attention was accorded the
speakers and much enthusiasm was mani
fested when the names of McKinley and
Hobart were mentioned.
The meeting was preceded by a maenifi
cent torchlight procession nearly half a
mile in length. It marched and counter
marched through the principal streets to
the time of lively airs, and at every turn
it was greeted with tumultuous shouts
from the multitude. Of the features of the
procession which elicited the most en
thusiasm were two large floats, one repre
senting free trade and tUe other protection.
The rree trade float showed a shop la a
dilapidated condition, with the mechanics
reclining on the rubbish and despair pic
tured on tbeir fact's, while tbe one repre
senting protection portrayed the opposite.
The mechanics' hammers wÂ«re ringing.
every one was on the move and iteip
faoes were suffused with the iightofjoy
and contentment. There was also a float
bearing a young woman dressed as a
Goddess of Liberty, surrounded by little
girl attendants andappropnate trappings.
This one was marked "protection" also,
bonfires gleamed and crackled along the
line of march. The Republicans are ex
ceedingly jubilant and express surprise at
the wonderful demonstration.
JITVS HEARD AT LODI.
Pictures ihe Results That Would Follow
Independent Free Coinage.
LODI, Cal., Oct. 2.â The large ball was
packed to-night when Louis Titus, undfer
the auspices of tne Lodi Republican Club,
discussed political issues. Hall and plat
form were handsomely decorated. People
came from far and near and there were
many ladies in the audience. Tne speaker
was frequently interrupted by hearty ap
plause. He said the advocates of silver
declared that free coinage would mean an
unlimited demand for silver, and conse
quently any ratio we pleased could be es
tablished, bnt free coinage, he claimed,
did not create a demand ; it simply meant
that the owner got bullion coined into
dollars and passed back to him. The
Government had nothing to do with it ex
cept the mechanical act of coining. The
owner has the same silver hÂ« had before,
so must find a market for it. The Govern
ment could not make money worth any
thing; that mns; be controlled by the
market value of bullion.

STAFFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
2.â Captain C. T. Dole of the track team
issued a call to the new athletes and can
didates for the track team to meet this
afternoon. About iifteen men answered
the call and several others reported later.
Captain Dole gave the men a short talk,
advising them that Stanford had lost
many of her best athletes by graduation,
and that it would be necessary for the new
men to fit themselves for the vacant
places. He expressed hope that with bard,
conscientious work of ail, Berkeley might
be beaten next spring in the intercolle
giate meet. He further advised the men
to train at every possible opportunity this
fall, not vigorously, but enough to put
themselves into shape for hard exercise
in the spring. He said the track would
be in shape for work by Monday next.
David Brown '97 made a speech to the
men, offering any aid he misht be able to
give them, and expressing the opinion
that more depended on them next year
than had depended on any previous track
team; that in order to uphold ytanford's
prestige on the track, they must aim and
labor "to defeat their rival* next season ;
that Stanford, having tied Berkeley, must
not rest satisfied there, but must advance.
The following men signed their names
to the track list:
Ben E. Sniper oi the Seattle High School for
the mile and the half mile. Record for mile,

COACH CROSS Is ANGRY.
Says the Stanford football Players Must
"llrnce Up."
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
2.â The football practice was very poor
last evening. Several of the beat players
took a lay-off, either because of sprains,
bruises or other incidents of the sport or
for less worthy causes. The coach is dis
gusted because the men do not pnt more
spirit into their play a~d worE better to
gether.
"Unless the fellows brace up materially
in the next few days," said Cross, "they
won't stand a goo^t of a show with the
Olympic team a week from Saturday."
Fisher '98 and Seawright '00, both at
half-back, did the best work of the day.
Fisher should undoubtedly be able to
develop into a first-clsss back, but he is
slow at getting under headway.
Most of the older players are putting up
fair games and when all the men can get
out aeain there should be something be*
sides mediocre football.
It is probable that tha freshmen eleven
â¢will play very few match games this year
outside of the regular prsctice. The orig
inal plan was to give the '00*8 every possi
ble game with an outside team that could
be arranged, but Captain Fickert of the
Varsity objects, says Switzer '98, the man
ager of the freshmen deven, so few games
if any will take place. Next week a game
will doubtless be clayed with the Belmont
Academy eleven.
Captain Fickeri's objections are ground
ed on the fact that these games detract
from the interest in the regular Varsity
practice and seriously interfere with it.
In addition there is more chance of in
jury to the freshmen players in these
match games than there would be in reg
ular practice and but little more advan
tage to the men participating.

score of 7to 1. Weather conditions were
most favorable, but only 3995 paicMbeir
entrance fee to the grounds.
Captain Tebeau sprained his back badly
while at the bat in the second inning and
retired irom ihe game. He suffered in
tensely, and may not play again for some
days. McGraw also left the game in its
early stage. He was not strong enough to
stand the nerve-rackiiig strain.
The baltimores played with confidence,
and in two innings hammered the emu
Young freely. Hoffer, on the other hand,
was invincible. Five scattered hits was
Cleveland's total. Two of them, a single
and a double, came m the sixth inning,
and gave the Spiders their only run.
Tebeau announced at the grounds that
Cuppy would certainly be up for the ti rst
battle, llanlon would not commit him
self, but *Corbett is his probable selection.
Score: Baltimores 7, 13, 1; Cle-eelands
1. 6, 4. Batteriesâ Hoffer and Robinson :
Young and Zimmer. Umpires â Sheridan

loosely.

KERN OFFICIALS EXCORIATED.
Surprising Charges of Violations of the
Law Returned by the County
Grand Jury.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Oct. 2. â The
Kern County Grand Jury, in almost con
stant session since the first of the year,
banded in a partial report this eyening
and took an adjournment until November
9. In the report every county official,
with the exception of Assessor Scott and
Superior Judge Conklin, is unmercifully
scored for bis alleged lack of business
methods and for plain violations of law in
various particulars.
The District Attorney receives the se
verest drubbing, it being charged that
wherever he could, by any possible reason
ing, favor any one but the taxpayer of the
county he cheerfully did it. The Board of
Supervisors is severely rebukea for the
startling list of illegal claims said to have
been allowed by it and for the conduct of
its individual members in demanding and
receiving money for Sunday and holiday
work. The Sheriff, Superintendent of
Schools, Tax Collector, Justices of the
Peace and constables undergo excoriation,
and the twisting of the law whereby the
Recorder has added to his already ample
salary is commended as an indication of
personal thrift, but denounced as unlawful
conduct on the part of a public official.
Killed in the Hart Mine.
REDDING, Cat,., Oct. 2.â At tbe Hart
mine, eight miles from this city, B.
Reynolds to-day met bis deatb in a most

to tbe next landing above, a distance of
ninety-six feet. A loaded car passed up
as he was standing there, but before tbe
empty one returned be bad fallen to tbe
200 level, striking tbe plank bead fore
most, killing him instantly.
Tola County lteadloclt.
WOODLAND, Cal., Oct. 2âThe dead
lock in the Republican nomination of a
Supervisor from the First District remains
unbroken. The adnerents of both Cor
nish and Cassellman are determined and
say they will not give in. Sessions have

AID FOR THE
IRISH PRISONERS
An Appeal Issued to the
Irish Race in Cali
fornia.
Substantial Way of Showing
Love for and Devotion to
Erin's Cause.
MONEY WILL COME IN SOON.
Knights of Tara to Hod a Grand
Picnic To-Morrow for the Pris
oners' Fund.
The Irish Nationalists of San Francisco
have undertaken, with great enthusiasm,
to show their appreciation of the recently
released Irish political prisoners and
devotion to the cause of their native land.
And this is to be done in the very expres
sive way of raising a handsome sum as a
contribution from the Irish people of Cali
fornia to the wretched men now let loose
from English dungeons.
That this work of love may be the better
carried out the Irish Political Prisoners'
Association has been organized, with Dr.
O'Toole as president.
A meeting of tue executive committee
of the association was held last evening at
K. R. B. Hall, Dr. O'Toole being in the
chair. There was present a large number
of delegates from the various Irish socie
ties of thia City and Oakland, besides sev
eral Irishmen who. have always been
prominent in Irish movements^
The principal business transacted was
the appointment of committees to solicit
subscriptions from the Irish people of thie
City and State for the relief of the recently
released Irish political prisoners.
The following address was ordered sent
to the various Irish societies of this City
and State and also to prominent citizens
ot Irish birth or descent:
TO THK IEISH KACJ IN CALIFOBNIA.
San Feancisco, Sept. 22, 1896.
There was recently released from English
prisons a number of Irishmen who had been
confined therein for many years on suspicion
of having been connected with dynamite out
rages committed, or about to be committed, in
England. During these yean they suffered
that cruelty and persecution which modern
civilization, as understood in England, has
brought to such fiendish perfection, and
which, in the case oi those unfortunate sus
pects, was doubly intensified by race an
tipathy.
The testimony of such men as Michael
Davitt, O'Donovan Rossa and the late John
Boyle O'Reilly has made the world familiar
with the cruelty and sufferings to which Irish
political prisoners are subjected by England.
But stronger testimony etill is that afforded
by the unfortunate men who have just been
set free. A few years of this treatment has
reduced these men to mere human wrecks,
broken in body and shattered in intellect,
living witnesses to the barbarous inhumanity
still practiced in the very heart of the great
civilized British empire.
With their life work interrupted, they come
to us entirely incapable of aiding themselves.
We therefore appeal to you, our country men
and women, to see that these meu are pro
vided for during the few remaining years of
their lives. It is unnecessary to dwell on this
subject. It is enough simply to poy^t to those
men and say to you: "These are yonr country
men, reduced to this condition througn love
and devotion to Ireland"; and, relying on
that open-hearted generosity which has char
acterized our people on every deserving occa
sion, we feel certain you will see that they
shall not want. Give England your answer to
her brutality.
The following-named gentlemen have been
appointed a committee to solicit and receive
subscriptions:
Those who ma> not and cannot be person
ally called upon may forward their subscrip
tions to Jeremiah Deasy, treasurer, 20 Sixth
street, San Francisco. M. C. o' Tools,

LOST FROM THE PERRY.
How Chief Xon- Commissioned Officer
Haverly Met Death.
ASTORIA, Or., Oct. 2.â The revenue
cutter Perry received orders to-day to pro
ceed to San Francisco, and it will leave
to-morrow or Sun day. The date for its
return has not yet been fixed. Captain
Smith gives the following particulars of
the drowning of Mr. Haverly, chief non
commissioned officer, shortly after the
Perry left for the north :
"Wben out two days from San Fran
cisco Mr. Haverly, who was engaged in
the performance of duties on deck, ex
posed himself unnecessarily dnring the
heavy weather which prevailed and
was washed overboard. Taking personal
charge of the bridge, I had a boat lowered
immediately and called for volunteers. In
a moment tbe boat was manned by five
men, but Haverly sank before anything
could be done to reach him. The boat
with the rescuing party was also capsized
and the occupants left struggling in the
water. After much difficulty lines were
thrown to the men and they were got on
board, but not until all had become so ex
hausted that it was several hours before
they thoroughly recovered."

a Supervisor be knew that it was to the
interest and advantage of this City to elect
a Board of Supervisors and a Mayor who
have had experience in municipal affairs.
It takes the ordinary man nearly the
whole term of his office to learn what is
best to do, and he finds himself, even
though honest, tricked. Therefore, a man
who has had experience as a Supervisor is
better prepared, if honest, to take the po
sition again, and to occupy the seat of the
Mayor of the City.
"None of you business men in selecting
some one to manage your affairs woula
take a man unless he knew something
about how to manage them. I have had
experience in three Boards of Supervisors.
I know that it takes the ordinary Super
visor some time to learn where he is atâ to
use a colloquialismâ and by the time he
learns that perhaps he is not serving the
people to the best of his ability.
"I regret the strife that has razed in the
rank's of the Republican party, and I bope
that between now and election day they
will forget all their divisions and conclude
that this election is of sufficient impor
tance for them to stand by Republican
principles and to elect their Congressmen
and electors and member? of the Legisla
ture, for the United States Senator de
pends upon the men you elect. If you
fleet William McKinley President of the
United States you want Republicans in
Congress and you don't want to take any
chances upon that question, therefore 1
advise harmony, and if we cannot have it,
Consider well what you will def, don't
crifice the party.
"I have pleaded with my friends not to
continue the strife. I have myself offered
to come down from the ticket to promote
harmony, but I have always understood
that there was no opposition to myself,
even from the other wing of the party,
and I am happy to say that the gentleman
who was nominated on tbe other side has
to-day shown a desire for peace and has
manifested true patriotism for his party
by withdrawing his name in favor of mine
for the position of Mayor of this City. He
is deserving of credit for doing all that he
can in his humble capacity to bring about
that condition of peace and harmony
which we all desire.
The speaker concluded by referring to
the distress brought 'about by Democratic
free trade and mismanagement of tbe
finances.
"The people," he added, "have suffered
enough from Democratic rule to atone for
all the sins of the damned."
Congressman Loud was the next speaker.
He called attention to the present indus
trial depression, which he said was a worse
condition of affairs than the country wit
nessed in 1860, immediately preceding the
Civil War. He deprecated the attempt that
ia being made by Democrats and Populists
to array one class of citizens against the
other, and the threatened destiuction of
the financial system under which this
country prospered. There is but one class
in this whole country, and that is the class
of the American people.
"Bryan says that if the Democratic
party succeeds we shall have a panic,"
continued Mr. Loud. "Does he know what
a panic would mean to the country at this
time, when the country is on the verge of
despair? There is not a man in the world
F>ho does not know that if we return the
â¢ Republican party to power we will have
f (tain that system of protection and loyalty
which has made this Nation the greatest
on the face of the earth.
"The Republican party stands to-day
where it always stood, on that broad
platform of protection to American in
dustry and labor."
Mr. Loud told of "a poor California
gold miner named lÂ»ane" whose income
is $50,000 per month, and who spoke at a
silver meeting in this City recently. Mr.
Loud had been asked why Mr. Lane, a
gold miner, should be for free silver. The
people who asked that question could
easily ascertain, said Mr. Loud, that a
man might, strike a rich cold mine and
not be sufficiently gifted to reason logic
ally on finance.
"Mr. Lane knows that the remonetiza
tion of silver will not decrease the price ot
gold," added the speaker. "He can, if he
wishes, pay his miners' wages in silver.
H* is not half as birr a fool as he look'sâ
and when I say that I don't mean any dis
respect to the gentleman â because he
catches them going ana he catches them
cominc."
Mr. Loud next turned his attention to
the claim of the Democrats and the silver
mine owners that the Government could
malte 100 cents out of 50 cents. If that
were true the Government could make 100
cento out of a mill by stamping a piece of
paper. The Populist assumes that the
Government has power to create value,
and they have repeatedly said that it was
folly to stamp either gold or silver.
They assume that the Government can
create wealth. "Now, if the Government
can create wealth it can create wealth in
unlimited quantities. If we can success
fully maintain a circulation of $50 per
capita and create value in that manner,
why not make enough value to make all
the people wealthy?"
The speaker next turned his attention
to the argument that the depreciation in
the bullion value of silver caused the de
preciation in the price of wheat. In reply
to this assertion he said: "Silver has de
preciated in the last lew days more tnan
4 cents an ounce, and in the same period
the price of wheat has risen 10 cents per
bushel.
Mr. Loud announced that he had good
tidings from Santa Clara County. He had
been told that there was a great wavering
among Republicans. When he inquired
where they were wavering he was in
formed that they were down in the valley,
but when he went down to the valley they
told him that all the Republicans there
t were stanch and true and solid. They had
heard that some Republicans over In the
foothills had turned Democrats. He asked
for the names of some of those Republi
cans, and when be called upon them he
found that they had been Populists for
years and years. i
. The speaker closed by. predicting that
Santa Clara would pive a-. majority of 750
for the Republican ticket. ,
After a song by a young lady volunteer
Chairman Taylor introduced Susan B.
Anthony, wno was received with a flat-:
tering round of npplause. She made an
j earnest appeal to her hearers to vote for
I the sixth constitutional amendment,
granting women the right to vote. Miss
Anthony caused- a laugh by saying that
!-iie had never in all the world received a
I heartier welcome than she ' had "at
i Brother Buckley's meeting" an evening
i or two before. -
T c speaker was well received and was
! heartily applauded.
H. V. Morehouse of Santa Clara was the
j next speaker. General W. H. L. Barnes
accompanied him on the platform.- Miss
j Anthony : introduced Mr. Morehouse as a
I friend of woman suffrage, and he launched
; out boldly into his subject. He said that
; he was in favor of the sixth amendment
because it was right to give to intelligence
the Dower of the ballot.
"I don't know whether all the women
of California want to ? vote and â . I don't
care. If 1 don't want to vote lat least
want to have the right: to vote. ; v

vote until they had a knowledge of tbe
constitution and history the country
and of the constitution of the State in

nia have this qualification they should be
entitled to -â¢ vote.- I know that 7 it is im

v "I would make a law to protect the

The speaker then turned his attention
to the plank in the Chicago platform de

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1896.
CATOR HIS DONE
THE DEMOCRACY
Where Now Are Maguire,
Foote, Jim Budd and
the Others?
Thomas Has Buried All Demo
cratic Possibilities in the
Election of a Senator.
WILL GRIMLY WIN OR RUIN.
The Democratic Party Will Cat an
Insignificant Figure in the
Assembly in Any Event.
Leading Demociats are looking with
something like stupid amazement at the
political operations of Thomas V. Cator.
For that matter a large portion of the Pop
ulist party are doing the same thing.
Democrats see that in the remote event
that the extensive fusion on legislative
candidates throughout the State returns
a combined Populist and Democratic ma
jority on joint ballot in the next Legis
lature the election of a Democrat will be
an impossibility.
If the next Legislature is not Re
publican, Cator will own the majority
and as many Democratic members
backed by many strong Democratic
influences, would never cast a ballot for
Thomas V. Cator, the situation, it is gen
erally seen by politicians, would create a
deadlock and a bitter row. Cator would
hold the Populist balance of power to an
adjournment without the election of a
Senator.
Cator has acquired remarkable boss
power in his party, and throughout the
State has traded any and everything
belonging to his party for Assemblymen,
always giving the Democrats the Senator
for White's benefit two years hence, and
throwing in judges and Supervisors
especially. Outside of San Francisco there
is hardly* a Democratic candidate for the
Assembly in the field.
In the face of this state of affairs all the
big Democrats who want to go to the Sen
ate are waking up in dismay. White has
been able to play trumps right along in
his game with Cator for partner, but no
body can see where John Dageett, Con
gressman Maguire, Governor Budd, W. W.
Foote or Frank Gould, all avowed candi
dates, have taken a trick.
And nobody can see what chance a man
of them would have between the Re
publican and Populist millstones if the
large hold-over Republican majority were
overcome. The Democracy will be a four
spot in the coming Assembly. The Popu
lists will cut no figure in the' smaller upper
h ouse.
All the Democratic candidates men
tioned and Gavin McNab, who has been
mentioned himself, comprise the Con
gressional and legislative standing com
mittee of the Democratic State Central
Committee, but this committee has never
drawn a breath of life. Each member has
simpiv either looked out for or dreamed
abnui'himself, while Cator has been teach
ing persimmons.
Maguire's friends have wondered and
hoped and splashed aronnd just a HttTd
! bit. Daggett effected the nomination of a
half-dozen friends on the Junta ticket.
The Democracy has thus been captured
by the shrewd Cator throughout the State
and the Democracy is sick with disgust
and despair.
But it is the coup which Cator has
quietly played in San Francisco within
i three or four days which has most sick-
I ened the Democracy. The ticket which
the Populist Legislative Convention in
dorsed last night was absolutely picked
out by Cator, whose word wss law.
It turned out that Cato^s deal with
Buckley did not cover the entire legisla
j live ticfcet. Some of it was too rotten for
Cator to trust. He found it well to make
some deals with Sam Rainey as well. He
investigated quietly and picked his men
I from both sides of tbe local Democracy.
' Every man indorsed had to pledge him
self satisfactorily to Cator in private, and
the Populist ticket is supposed to be for
Cator and White.
Each candidate has had to pledge him
self to vote half the legislative patronage
they may have a finger in to the Populist
politicians for another thing. Cator
counts on bossing the jobs in the next
Legislature.
Every candidate is pledged, too, to not
I vote for John Daggett for Senator in par
ticular, or any gold man in general. Can-
I didates have all been before Cator and the
; investigating committee within three days
| and have had to pledge themselves in ad
i vance to these things to have their names
considered.
Cator, with his party influence to use as
absolutely as ever Chris Buckley used his
party's power, has thus done the best ho
could with twenty-three candidates lor
the Legislature from San Francisco, all of
whom are pledged to divvy the legislative
patronage with the Hungry Populists and
to vote for the evil one before John Dag
gett. Cator is gambling on holding their
votes for himself.
Toe spectacle of the Democracy of the
State being sold out to a Caior in this
wholesale way gives the discouraged Dem
ocrats a tired feeling, generally, and so
disgusts thousands that their knives will
be played into Cator's ambition.
It's a delightful prospect for Maguire,
Foote, Budd and those fellows. Wait
until the real fun of it all arrives.
THE IROQUOIS CLUB.
A Resolution Indorsing Judge Heb-
bard Warmly Discussed.
The Iroquois Club spent about an hour
of its weekly meeting last evening in a
hot discussion of a resolution offered by
J. J. Flynn indorsing J. C. B. Hebbard,
Non-Partisan candidate for the Superior
bench.
Judge Hebbard had many friends in
the meeting and Max Popper, ex-Con
troller Dunn and others talked in favor of
this action in view of Judge Hebbard's
record, but it was warmly urged by C. A.
Reynolds, Louis Meteger, Samuel McKee
and others that the club should stick
by its party; that there were honest
men on the Democratic ticket and that it
would be a precedent that would bring
trouble to tbe club. The resolution was
finally referred to the committee on reso
lutions without being acted upon.
Max Ponpei reported that the water
front campaign meeting held by the club
cost $9 75, and it was decided to hold more
little meetings south of Market.
To-morrow the clnb will enjoy its an
nual bullehead breakfast at San Leandro.
Now Rainey Headquarters.
The campaicn committee of the Junta
met last night with tbe "purity" commit
tee appointed by Chairman Ragan and
decided to get the old quarters in the
Flood building, formerly rented of the
State Democratic Club.
Having no place to meet since Max
Popper so ruthlessly carted away the fur
niture and closed up the headquarters,
tbev met at the rooms of the State Com
mittee in tbe California Hotel. It was de
cided to hold district meetings and to hold
a ratification meeting next Wednesday
night to glorify Sam Rainey's ticket.
O'BRIEN AND McKINLEY.
They Are Greeted Enthusiastically
by the Continental League.
Thomas B. O'Brien, Republican candi
date for Congress from the Fourth Dis
trict, and Benjamin McKinley, the
nephew of the coming President of the
United States, spoke last evening before
the Continental League at Saratoga Hall.
Mr. O'Brien called the attention of his
audience to Representative Maguire, his
opponent, now in Massachusetts telling
the mechanics of that State of the beauties
of free trade. "If lam sent to Congress,"
said the speaker, "there will not be a
tariff measure so high that I will not vote
for it."
O'Brien advocated the completion of the
Nicaragua canal and the closing of the
Golden Gate to cheap Asiatic labor and its
products. He was enthusiastically ap-
E lauded, and by a resolution the league
eartily indorsed his candidacy.
Mr. McKinley's remarks were greeted
with rounds of'loud applause.
GERMAN REPUBLICANS.
Enthusiastic Mooting of the Club at
413 Bush Street Last Evening;.
The German-American Republican Club
held its regular weekly meeting last night
at 413 Bush street.
Dr. Muffe, chairman of the executive
committee, reported that the arrange
ments for the great mass-meeting of the
German-American Republican citizens,
which will be held on October 14, at the
Auditorium, were actively progressing.
The next speaker was Justice of the
Peace G. C. Groezinger, who dwelt in de
tail upon the silver question as explained
by Candidate Bryan in his various ad
dresses, and showed the fallacy of the
propositions advocated by that gentleman.
The next speaker was Attorney Leon
Samuels, who urged the fact that tbe pri
mary question of the day, free trade or
protection, was not to be lost sight of.
In particular he denounced the Populists
on account of their seeming alliance with
tbe repudiated and unscrupulous Demo
cratic political boss, Chris Buckley.
The other speaker of the evening was
Captain George Raabe, who advocated
the new charter, and his views evidently
met with the approval of the club.
Before adjourning the club unanimously
indorsed tbe candidacy of G. C. Groe
zinger for Justice of the Peace.
POSED IN CATHODE RAYS,
The Governor Inspects the
Fair and the Ghostly
Light
A Speech ot Welcome by President
Denicke and the Governor's
Response.
The entrance of Governor James H.
Budd and staff into the Home Products
Fair last night was slightly spectacular.
A handkerchief was waved at the main
entrance as soon as they came into sight.
The crowd exclaimed, "Here he comes!"
and every face, from those peering over
the railings of the galleries down the stair
cases to the crowded main floor, was
turned that way. At the wave of the
tmndkerchief the band began to play
"Hail to the Chief," and to the strains of
that inspiring selection the Governor, his
light-colored sombrero in his left hand,
with President E. A. Denicke of the Me
chanics' Institute at hia side, and his staff
in uniform and glittering gold braid,
marched down the broad center aisle.
The members of the staff present were:
Colonel Boie, Colonel Burgin, Colonel
Young, Colonel Peeler, Colonel Doolittle,
Colonel Dunn, Colonel Choynski, Colonel
Andrews and Captain Carrington of the
United States army.
The procession ascended a iow platform
erected in front of a new flower booth in
the center aisle, where President Hugh
Craig of the Chamber of Commerce, Presi
dent Julian Sonntng of the Manufactur
ers' and Producers' Association and Presi
dent Do::rmann of the Merchants' Ass
ociation assisted President Denicke in the
lornial reception. There was an interlude
ot handshaking and introductions and
then four young girls stepped into view
and blushingly pinned boutonnieres on the
Governor and the glittering tinsel of each
individual uniform.
In a one-minute speech, which, on ac
count of the babel of noises, could not be
heard six feet from the speaker, President
Denicke extended a hearty welcome to the
Governor, stating they lelt it an honor
that he could find time to come from his
state duties to honor the fair with his in
spection. Governor Budd replied, saying
that he was glad to be present to witness
such an admirable exhibit of the manufac
turing resources of San Francisco and
California. That was the end of the cere
monies.
Escorted by the reception committee,
the Governor and his staff started on a
tour of inspection of the fair. They went
through nearly every aisle. The Governor
was offered samples of everything, from
nxle grease to hot biscuits, and before he
finished the trip the gubernatorial pock
ets bulged with picture-cards, manilla
rope, baskets, soap, popcorn, complexion
powder and a patent shoestring clasp,
with the motto, "Every lady should have
one."
The Governor was induced to walk into
the darkness and then into the ghostly
light of a Roentgen ray factory. The ex
posure showed him with no broken bones
and his heart in the right place.
In one of the aisles the Governor paused
to say to a Call reporter: "It is a wonder
ful fair. I have been, to every fair here.
There has always been an improvement,
but this is the greatest improvement of
ali."
In the private rooms of the Pavilion an
informal banquet was given for the Gov
ernor and staff, at which it was announced
there would be no speech-making.
The above cut is taken from a photo
graph of the exhibit of the Gundlnch-Bund
schu Wine Company at the Mechanics'
Fair, which has been considered by the
majority of visitors to far exceed in point
of excellence and artistic arrangement
any exhibit of home products on display.
The wines of this famous company are too
well known to require any extended com
mendation, and, as was expected, they
carried off the first prize over all other
competitors for their superiority. This
company holds highest awards of merit
from all the leading expositions, includ
ing Philadelphia, Paris and Chicago.
Their vast vineyards are known as the
Rhinefarm Vineyards in Sonoma County.
Wherever California wine industries
have required public demonstration the
Gundlach-Bandschu Wine Company has
always been foremost in the extent and
superiority of display.
An Artistic Exhibit.
No one visiting the fair could fail to
notice the beautiful and artistic exhibit
made by the California Art Glass Works,
located in the gallery, of which 'William
Schroeder is president. One of the partic
ularly attractive exhibits of this artistic
display is the art-glass bedchamber win
dow of Cupid and Psyche. The portrait
of Longfellow and that of Reina Louisa
are also particularly worthy of special
comment. The many other designs .of
scroll worlc in beveleif plate glass all lend
to making this beautiful display an exhibit
not soon to be forgotten. The office and
works of this company are located at 103
--105 Mission street, where they are at pres
ent engaged in extensive manufacturing
of glass work for many of the most prom
inent buildings now in course of construc
tion in this City.
The National Brewery's Exhibit.
The exhibit particularly worthy of
special comment at the Mechanics' Fair
is the display of the National Brewing
Company. It is located on the main floor,
near the entrance, and is composed of the
different brands of bottled lager beer
brewed by the National Brewing Com
pany. It is not necessary to be a connois
seur of drinks to note tbe fine supremacy
of National brews over ali others. The
brands manufactured by this well-known
establishment include the "Extra Pale,"
"Standard," "Munchener" and "Culm
bacher," which are manufactured from
only the best of hops. Tbe National beers
have always taken first prize for the
quality and superiority of their beers over
all others in all exhibits and competitions,
and this year it looks like a prizewinner.
Should Win Firat Prize.
One of the neatest and most attractive
exhibits at tbe Mechanics' Fair is the dis
play of brooms, brushes, etc., by Zan
Bros., the well-known manufacturers. It
shows the making of brooms and brushes
in their various stages as they are put
througn the machinery, which is in opera
tion during tbe afternoon and evening.
Zan Bros, hold many testimonials as
first prizes awarded at various expositions
for the superiority of their goods over all
others, and this occasion should not prove
an exception to any former competitions
in this regard, for their neat exhibit and
the superiority of their goods are worthy
of more than passing comment.
Awarded Fir* Prize.
The California Stump-puller is undoubt
edly among the most wonderful inven
tions of modern times, and of inestim
able benefit to the farmer. Towering
masses of trees can by it be uprooted and
overturned by the power of a single horse.
Tbe office and works of the company are
located at 82 and 84 Zoe street in this City,
where the machine can be seen on exhibi
tion. It is the most practical, powerful
and successful machine of its kind.
NOT IN POLITICS.
The Board of Health Issues a Circular
to Heads of departments.
The following circular letter to the
heads of the departments under its con
trol was issued by the Board of Health
yesterday:
The Board ot Health has sought always and
earnestly to give publicity and emphasis to
the fact that politics, so called, and the public
health are matters whoso mutual interests can
be subserved best by the widest posssible sepa
ration.
The necessities and the advantages of party
organization and party success are subordinate
to the preservation of the Ufa and health of
the citizen.
This board Is charged with the latter high
duty; and, wbile it does not think of inter
ferine with the voluntary disposition of his
property by any citizen, It desires to call the
attention of its officers ami employes that, as
the attainment of their office was not due to
party fealty, its continuance is not dependent
on party service.
This board, therefore, will consider it a
cause for dismissal if any of its officers or em
ployes levy or collect, request or transmit, di
rectly or indirectly, any part of the salary of
any other officer or employe for the benefit of
either or any political party.
AGAINST THE CHARIER,
Voluminous Document by the
Labor Council for Circula
lation Among Voters.
Petition for a Boycott on the Armour
Packing Company Received From
Kansas City.
The San Francisco Labor Council met
last evening. The principal item of inter
est was the reading of a voluminous docu
ment condemning the new charter.
A joint communication was received
from two combined labor unions of Kansas
City petitioning that all "Jovers of de
cency ceasa trading with the ArmourJJfacic
ing Company."
The circular stated that two District
Court Judges have issued injunctions
against a boycott being placed on the com
pany, but that they will persist in spite of
the injunction. The principal reason of
the boycott was said to be the discharge of
several male and female employes.
The law and legislative committee
handed in a report on the new charter,
comprising forty- five closely written pages.
The report was adopted, and it was de-
cided to send out 30.0G0 printed copies to
the voters of the City.
The report declared that the adoption or
rejection of the new charter was the most
important local issue for the coming cam
paign.
"The vote on the charter will decide,"
read the report, "whether we shall be goy

The clause for regulating public assem
.Dlages was termed "one of the most objec
tiona Die features of the charter. The com
mittee did not believe that either the
d istribution of handbills or the holding of
public as?emblages should be governed by
the. Supervisors.
Strenuous objection was made to the es
tablishing of manufacturing institutions
in connection with prisons and the em
ploying of cbaingangs on the streets, De
cau se the former would interfere with free
labor and the latter add disgrace to pun
ishment.
The provision for amendment was also
vigorously criticised.
It was decided that provisions be made
for advertising the mass-meeting to be
held in Metropolitan Temple on the even
ing of October 12, and adjournment was
then taken.
Three Secret Indictments.
The United States Grand Jury held a short
session yesterday afternoon, returning three
indictments, which were ordered placed on
the secret file. Two were small postal cases,
but ihe third, Lincoln Brodt, is regarded in
Federal circles as a case of great importance.
Some weeks ago Brodt entered at the Marys
viiie juand Office 320 acres of what he claimed
was timber land. The tract in question is
near Magalia, Butte County. It seems that
Merry and Parry own several mines within
the alleged timber lands, one of which, the
Alki mine, has been in operation for more
than nine years. When these gentlemen
learned of Brodt's action they reported the
matter to the Federal authorities here, and a
searching Investigation was at once instituted.
Several witnesses from Butte County were ex
amined, their evidence showing that the land
entered by Brodt was mineral and not timber
land. There are said to be six counts against
Brodt, the most serious being a charge of per

FOR PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Obio
FOR VICF-VRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896Â»
Well done, Mr. Sonntag.
Unity and victory are now certain.
One month from to-day McKinley will
be elected.
The way to have harmony is simply to
pet in and harmonize yourself with tbe
majority.
The people are getting on to the silver
trust, and by election day will be ready to
sit down on it.
The issue of the campaign is to put an
end to Democratic experiments and return
to sound business.
During the month of September the
public debt increased over $1,806,000. De
mocracy is still in the saddle.
The dollar of our fathers was never a
dishonored dollar and the people will
never vote to dishonor it now.
Bimetallism and statesmanship would
improve business, but free silver and
crankism would ruin any country.
Every intelligent citizen can see that
the Non-Partisan ticket has a string on it,
and Rainey has a pull on the string.
The Bismarck letter to Governor Culber
son of Texas has proven to be a roorback.
The Governor didn't translate it correctly.
It is conceded that Bryan is virtually
beaten and the next thine is to make sure
of beaming the Bryanite candidates for
Congress.
Democratic agitations are retarding busi
ness and Democratic success would ruin
business. The country must beware of
Bryanibm.
The free coinage of silver would not put
money into circulation. We must restore
the protective tariff and reopen the mills
to do that.
Bear in mind that now is the time to get
rid of Buckley, Rainey and tbe whole
gang. Work for Colonel Taylor and make
a clean sweep.
What do good Democrats think of the
combination with Cator? What do good
Populists think of Cator's combination
with Buckley?
Republicans! uphold the State Central
Committee; recognize its authority; ac
qniesce in its decision, and under one flag
go forward to victory.
Workingmen of San Francisco, do you
wish any more free trade ? Do you wish
to be represented in Congress by men who
will vote lor free trade ?
Mr. Phelanâ Dear sir: Do you know
why Rainey nominated you? Do you
thine he intends to use you for anything
more than a decoy duck?
Have the Non-Partisans agreed that
their candidate for Mayor shall connn
biate with Rainey, or have they over
looked the circumstance?
It is now in order for Professor Ross to
explain that bis famous letter was a gen
tle university joke all tbe same as Presi
dent Jordan's cat picture.
All the stories from the East give us
new reasons for rejoicing that we live in
California. We have here neither the
Bryan tour nor the hurricanes.
The fusion leaders may be fooling Cator,
but do not let them fool you. Elect none
but Republican legislators and make sure
of a Republican United States Senator.
The announcement that Chauncey De
pew will answer Bryan raises great expec
tations of fun to come. The answer will
undoubtedly add to the gayety of nations.
In the present close division of parties
in the United States Senate every vote is
important. California can afford to take
no risks this year with Democratic or
Populist legislator?.
Several platforms have given way dur
ing Bryan's tour, and now one has fallen
under Vice- President Stevenson. It seems
that Democracy cannot find a good plat
form anywhere this year.
Does any Republican Believe it possible
to elect any Republican ticket in this City
except that beaded by Charles L. Taylor?
Does any Republican doubt that Colonel
Taylor can be elected if the party unites in
his support?
A poll made by the Chicago Tribune
through the medium of secret ballots
shows that 90 per cent of the skilled labor
of Illinois is for McKinley, and it is a fair
assumption that the wcrkingmen of the
rest ol the country will vote about the
same way.
A WOED TO REPUBLICANS.
The retirement of Mr. Sonntag from the
contest which threatened to divide and
defeat the Republican party in this City
will suggest to all loyal members of the
party the folly of further fighting. Why
should there be any continuance of the
dispute, which has been carried to the
highest party authority in the State and
settled in accordance with the time
honored and universally followed rules
and practices of the organization?
Party discipline is absolutely essential
to party organization and party success.
There must be somewhere within every
organization an authority which all
members recognize, respect and obey.
That authority is the State Central
Committee. None can question that in
the Republican party at any rate the State
Central Committee is made up of men of
the highest character, of just impartiality
and of genuine devotion to Republican
principles. It is composed of eighty mem
ber- â one from each Assembly district in
the Stateâ and the executive committee
of twenty-one members selected by the
chairman of the late Republican State Con
vention. The committee deservedly en
joys the confidence of the Republicans of
the State.
It speaks with an authority given it by
the party itself, and how can any one who
calls himself a Republican deny that
authority without denying at the same
time the right of the Republican organiza
tion to be a self-governing body? In every
State of the Union the administration of
the party is intrusted to a State Central
Committee, to whose decisions loyal mem
bers yield a cheerful obedience.
Wheie there are differences of opinion
there must be a way to decide them. The
State Central Committee is the authority
which has the right to decide all
questions of the parly. In this San
Francisco contest it has spoken, with
but one dissenting voice. Party discipline
and loyalty will give support to the de
cision. Those who try to prolong the
dissensions will find no favor among those
who desire to see a victory for Republican
ism.
There should be no rebellion against the
decision of this high authority of the party,
to which the controversy was voluntarily
referred. Mr. Ruef (himself a member of
the State Executive Committee) and those
whom he represents are in honor bound
to abide the decision rendered. True
and loyal Republicanism demands that
they submit to party authority, and if
they would hereafter be credited with the
fealty to the Republican party which
they so constantly assert they will go no
further in this business. Tlie fight within
the party has been fought to a finish.
Now let it stop.
MUNICIPAL POLITICS.
Citizens of San Francisco, the issues of the
municipal campaign have been formulated
by the various conventions and are now
before you. The chief of these issues is
the choice of men to administer the affairs
of the City. All candidates are pledged
to economy, progress, lower taxation, pub
lic improvements aud administrative re
form. To which set of candidates shall
the work of reform be entrusted?
Candidates for office are to be judged by
the record they have made in public and.
private life. They are to be judged also
by their sssociates. We must elect men
of good personal character who are sur
rounded and supported by good men.
Unless the candidate be honest be will not
try to fulfill bis pledges, and unless his sup
porters are equally honest he cannot fulfill
them if be tries.
You know that back of the ticket headed
by Supervisor Dimond stands Boss Buckley
and his gang. You know that back of the
ticket headed by Mr. I'helan stands Boss
Rainey and his gang. You know aiso that
back of the ticket headed by Colonel Tay
lor stands a group of men who represent
the Best element of our civic life â men
who have a personal and business interest
in the welfare of the City â men who are
large property holders, taxpayers and em
ployers of labor. Which of these tickets
best represents yon? Which is most like
ly to fulfill the pledges made toyou?
Colonel Taylor has been tried in office.
His official record has been published from
week to week in the papers of the City and
is known to all who read. Has it not been
a record that winsyourapproval? Has he
done anything in office to which just ob
jection can be made? Has he not been
faithful always to the performance of duty ?
Has he not guarded the interests of the
taxpayers and of the people generally ?
What is the choice presented to you? Is
it not the simple one of deciding whether
our municipal affairs shall be intrusted to
Colonel Taylor and his associates on the
ticket or turned. over to tbe men who would
owe their election as they owe their nomi
nations to either Buckley or Rainey?
With such a choice before you, can you
hesitate to decide?
Repubiicans of San Francisco, do any of
you believe you can elect any Republican
ticket in this City except that headed by
Coionel Taylor, which the State Central
Committee has pronounced tbe only
genuine Republican ticket in this City?
Do any of you doubt that Colonel Taylor
will be elected if the party supports him
against the wrangling and divided bosses?
Will you not, as a loyal Republican and as
a good citizen, unite wita other good
citizens in making a clean sweep of the
bosses and assuring San Francisco a
municipal government which shall be at
once economical, progressive and honest
in all its departments?
AN APPEAL.
In his address to the Western Reserve
delegation Major McKinley said: "Never
has the Republican cause more closely Ap
pealed to conscience and intelligence than
in this campaign." The meaning of this
is that the conscience of no right-thinking
American should permit him longer to see
tbe destitution among working people,
caused by shutting down tbe Nation's in
dustries as a result of the Wilson-Gorman
act, without putting forth all his strength
and influence to have the great wrong
righted, and that the intelligence of the
people should give hearty sanction to the
effort.
And it is true that the time has come
when the appeal" of the thousands in en
forced idleness for employment must be
listened to. For three years the condition
of wage-earners in all industries has been
growing worse, and for no reason other
than that an unjust and hurtful law bars
the way to remunerative employment.
Surely no fair-minaed man is willing that
wage-earners should be subjected to pov
erty and distress, especially when all that
is required to give them proper conditions
of existence is to enact a law that shall
permit the industries to give them work
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1896.
at good pay. These idle men are in no
sense objects of charity. They are manly
men and loyal, high-minded citizens, and
all they ask is a chance to employ their
brain and muscle at remunerative wages.
This certainly is an important cam
paign, not only because the honor and
credit of the Nation is udder attack, but
because it is necessary to the well being
ol all the people that mill and factory and
shop should resume operations. The ex
periment of filling the markets with
articles that are the product of foreign
countries has shown in a thousand ways
that protection against that sort of thing
must be had if we would be a free, pros
perous and independent people. The is
sue is narrowed down to two inseparable
propositions â the preservation of the Na
tion's honor and credit and ample oppor
tunity for working people to secure em
ployment at good wages. Major McKinley
stands for those propositions. Mr. Bryan
stands for repudiation of the Nation's
solemn promises and for a still nearer
approach to free trade than the present
low tariff act provides.
MR. SONNTAG'S WITHDRAWAL.
In following the example of Mr. Horace
Davis and retiring from a contest which
threatened to divide the Republican vote
in this City Mr. Henry P. Soantag will
have the applause not only of genuine
Republicans but of all good citizens. His
action goes far toward unifying the Re
publican party. It brightens the pros
pect of success at the polls and eives a
fair assurance of the election of Colonel
Taylor and of the establishment of a good
municipal administration in this City.
Among the reasons assigned by Mr.
Sonntag for his patriotic course is one
which deserves the careful consideration
of every voter. It refers to the serious
point of what would be the result of the
adoption of the proposed new charter.
Mr. Bonntac says:
The Mayor, under that charter, would be
vested with great power and responsibilities
and would have the appointment of many
public officials. The election of a Mayor in
that event would be of great importance to the
Republican party of this City, and bo, after
full consideration, I feel that I should not do
anything that might possibly jeopardize the
election of a Republican to that office, which
two Republican candidates in the tield might
do, and I have, therefore, decided to step aside
in the interest of party unity and to subserve,
as I believe, the best Interest of this City by
assuring the election of a Republican to that
office.
No one can read these words without
realizing both the truth and the impor
tance of them. San Francisco faces a pos
sible crisis in her history. The adoption
of the new charter would certainly be a
crisis. This is no time to take chances, no
time to make experiments. No class of
citizens can afford to run the risk of elect
ing the candidate of either the Buckley or
Rainey faction of the Democratic party.
We mast elect a good Mayor in order to
be sure of anything like a good govern
ment.
Mr. Sonntag pays a justly deserved com
pliment to Charles L. Taylor in speaking
of him as "a respected citizen, who has
tilled many positions of public trust with
honor and fidelity, has been nominated by
one or more conventions of citizens for
that office. He is a Republican, and, in
my opinion, would make a conscientious
and able Mayor."
No one can question the justice of this
estimate of Mr. Taylor's character. It is
to be trusted, therefore, that Mr. Sunn
tag's action will mean the end of tbe long
fight in the Republican party, and that
from this time forward we can go on
unitedly for victory and good govern
ment. The imitation of Mr. Sonntag's
example by other Republicans who are in
a position similar to bis would complete
the unity of the party and assure victory.
Is it too much to expect them to show this
regard for the interests of the party and
the welfare of the City?
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
To-morrow's edition of The Call will
contain a number of particularly bright
and interesting features, and, it is almost
needless to add, all tbe. news of all
the world, politically and otherwise.
It isn't every week that a literary menu
equal to the one that will be presented to
morrow can be published, because the
bent efforts of writers, editors and artists
sometimes fall short of their own high
ideas, and there is, too, sometimes a dearth
of attradive features as there is of news.
And wiiile The Sunday Call has increased
in popularity each week, as the ever grow
ing subscription list amply proves, it is
also true that to the trained editorial eye
at least the attractiveness of its literary
supplement must vary at times, though,
perhaps, to an extent inappreciable to the
general reader.
However, the bill of fare for the coming
Sunday's issue would seem to satisfy even
the most critical, and a bare recital of the
titles of some of the more attractive fea
tures is sufficient:
Tender Sentiment and Fierce Passion
to Be Weighed and Measured.
Absorbing Tales of Vanished Mines.
A Little Fat Queen and Her Big Jubilee.
A Thing of Beauty.
As Free as the Air.
Who Have Grapes to Sell Smile Com
placently.
Good Manners for Horses.
Some Four-footed Soldiers.
New and Beautiful Autumn Fancies of
tbe Dressmakers.
"In Childhood's Realm," the best chil
dren' s page published in any daily news
paper.
Strange Harvest Ceremonies of an Un
canny People.
Building of the Oreat Warships for the
New Navy.
The Year 1901 and the Law of Cycles.
A Mighty Nation That Sank in Mid
ocean Before the Great Deluge.
Manpoaa's Harness for the Mystic
Power.
Aside from these and many other inter
esting and handsomely illustrated depart
ments there 'will be the Book Reviews,
Whist, and a host of good reading matter.
TWO KINDS OF BIMETALLISM.
Mr. Bry?n will not advance the cause
for which he is laboring by trying to im
peach th'- honor and integrity of Major
McKinley. The people of this country,
irrespective of party, look upon Major
McKinley as the highest type of Ameri
can manhood. There are very many who
would not vote for him because they are
not in sympathy with the principles of
his party, but no one questions his per
sonal integrity. No one believes Major
McKinley to be capable of accommodat
ing himself to any political doctrine for
personal political advantage, and Mr.
Bryan shows ignorance of public senti
ment when he undertakes to make it ap
pear that his opponent is a mere political
weathercock. Hitherto Mr. Bryan has
held himself aloof from that sort of cam
paigning, and it must be that he is set
ting desperate in the face of sure defeat
that makes him invent absurd charges
against Major McKinley.
If Mr. Bryan will take the trouble to
trace Major McKinley's record on the
silver question from his first public utter
ance down to his speech to the last visit
ing delegation he will find that he has
always been a consistent bimetallist. and
he will also find that Major McKinley has
always mixed a good deal of sound busi
ness Â»ense with his attitude on the coin
age question.
The difference between Major McKin
ley's plan of re-establishing the double
standard and Mr. Bryan's free-gold-and
silver-coinage scheme is broad and dis
tinct, and they are necessarily dia
metrically opposed. Major McKinley's
plan contemplates the remonetization of
silver in the interest of the Nation's com
merce. Mr. Bryan's scheme has in view
the doubling of the price of the product
of silver mines. Each has in mind the
free and unlimited coinage of silver, but
Major McKinley looks to the good of all
the people, while Mr. Bryan looks to the
interests of silver mine owners and specu
lators.
Major McKinley refuses to sacrifice our
foreign commerce, amounting to $2,000.
--000,000 annually, in which all the people
have interest, to enhance the bullion price
of silver. He insists that other countries
with whom we have business relations
shall be invited to meet with us in con
ference to not only agree upon an inter
national basis for a double standard of re
demption money (silver and gold), but to
enter into reciprocal trade relations to the
end that we may have still more and
better foreign markets for our surplus
products. Mr. Bryan says in effect: "Let
our foreign commerce ko to perdition.
Double tbe price of the product of silver
mines. That is my position on the coin
age question."
A GOOD PAIR ENDS.
The Mechanics' Fair, which closes to
night, has been the most valuable and en
couraging object lesson ever seen in Cali
fornia in the way of illustrating the extent
and fertility of our State resources. For
a month all shades and varieties of home
products have been tastefully arrayed in
the imposing pavilion in such a manner as
to encourage those whose faith in this
great State and whose belief in its pro
ductive possibilities are unwavering.
It was held by some enthusiasts in the
pioneer days of this favored land that the
earth was so fertile in diversified re
sources that an empire of industry ought
to be founded here free from dependence
on any State or nation on earth. While
the necessity for such an alienation from
sister States has never arisen a study of
the exhibits made at the fair this year
confirms the early opinion that California
is an empire that could survive and pros
per in the manifold fields of industry that
characterize this marvelous age, even
were it cut off from the balance of the
world. Such an illustration of the re
sources of the soil as that now closing is
encouraging to those who have cast their
fortunes with the State, and it attracts the
attention of desirable classes from abroad,
so that it will finally result in far-reach
ing benefits to the commonwealth as a
whole.
No one who walked through the many
great departments of the exhibition
during the past month has failed
to hare it vividly impressed upon his
mind that few, if any, regions in the
world offer such luxuriance and diversity
of useful resources as California. In the
realm of growing things, whether plant,
animal or fish, there was a bewildering
abundance, and manufacturers made a
splendid showing as well.
He whose mind revels in the wonders
of mechanics could feast for hours among
the gigantic evidences of achievement dis-
Dlayed by the Union Iron Works, the fore
most sbip-building concern in America,
whose conquests are known round the
world; or one of that temperament might
have spent days among the great machines
in the mining department, where crushers
and concentrators vied with on* another
to pulverize the great rocks that were
heaved up by elemental forces years ago.
There were interesting exhibits of
crockery, glassware, cordage, cotton, min
eral products, oereals and products of the
farm, and various exhibits from the
trades, so that altogether there was enough
to make a Caiifurnian proud and attract a
stranger to these shores. The good results
are so apparent that it is probable that the
home product department of future ex
hibits will be given marked attention.
It is encouraging in this connection to
note the fact that a home-product exhibi
tion is being arranged in Los Angeles
on lines similar to those of our Me
chanics' Fair. It will open on Janu
ary 3 and continue until the 31st.
This promises to be an instructive and
interesting exhibition of home prod
ucts exclusively,- and it will no doubt do
for the couth a benefit similar to that
brought about by the great Pavilion ex
hibit here. No work can be of more per
manent benefit to the State than that
which teaches the people self-confidence
and shows them the extent and fertility
of the resources of California.
CAMPAIGN ECHOES.

Bryan propaganda. It would, if applied, help
them much more than the American farmers.

This is tbe situation: A vote for Bryan and
Sewell or Watson is a vote for repudiation and
civic disorder. A vote for Palmer and Buckner
is half a vote for sound money and half a sur

liking. A vote for McKinley and Hobart is the
only direct means of securing good money aDd

SCORED BY
EDITORS.
Mr. Hearst's Attitude on
Free Coinage Is De
nounced
How Popocratfc Success Would
Add to the Magnitude of
His Fortune.
The light that has been thrown upon
the animus of Mr. Hearst in so ardently
working for Bryanism and the free coin
age of silver continues to attract attention
from that gentleman's contemporaries,
and they continue to talk very plainly on
the subject.
SUFFICIENT REASON.
Stockton Record.
The Call shows that the silver mines owned
by Hearst will increase his revenue from
$10,000 to $75,000 per month in case of free
coinage of silver. This is sufficient reason why
Mr. Hearst's papers, the Examiner of San Fran
cisco and the Jonrnal of New York, are clamor
ing for free silver. Still there are papers which
have even better reasons than Hearst. He
has at least got to secure free coinage before
his mines yield the additional income. The
reward is therefore contingent on success.
Those organs that have received their silver
mine dividend in advance may be said to exist
on the prudential side of the issue. Contin
gent fees In politics and Journalism never pan
out very wellâ not more than 53 cents on a
dollar. But a lump sum for a retainer is such
a cheerful evidence of prosperity that convic
tions are soothed and zeal sustained through
the most arduous campaign. We are not dis
posed to view the Examiner with aversion, but
rather with eyes of pity, tempered with some
what of admiration for its heroism In under
taking such a difficult task merely on a contin
gency. Had it been working for a corporation
Instead of its proprietor's mining Interests it
would have demanded a regular wage, or say
a $12,000 fee In advance.
INCONSISTENCY SHOWN UP
Santa Kosa Republican.
The San Francisco Call has been success
fully showing up the inconsistency of the
Examiner of that city on the financial ques
tion. For some time the latter paper nagged
the former on its changed position in regard
to silver coinage. Finally The Call turned
upon Its Democratic-Populistlc contemporary
and it has made good use of its inning.
In 1895 the Examiner was a sound-money
paper. Then it declared in favor of a silver
dollar containing a dollar's worth of silver.
May 4. 1895, it said its experience had not en
couraged It to believe that this country
could maintain parity of value of the two
metals at 16 to 1 and suegested 25 to 1. Then
that paper stood by Carlisle and opposed 50
cent or 90 cent dollars. The Call is now re
publishing those articles to the discomfiture of
the Examiner in its present position.
THE MONARCH SQUEALS.
Woodland MalL
The Call's article showing the heavy in
terests of the Hearst estate in silver mines and
incidentally why the Examiner and its twin
brother, the New York Journal, are so strongly
in favor of free silver, has caused tbe Monarch
to squeal, and it attempts to give an explana
tion that does not explain. The Call's article
goes a long way toward showing up the
hypocrisy of young Hearst and his two papers.
THE FLAG OF THE FIRST BRIGADE.
" This Is the fla? of the First Brigade,"
Tne captain said with pride.
As the stranger gazed on tbe stars that biased
And the crimson stripes and wide,
And thought of the brave
Who had found a irrave â
Who had fough , (or the flag and â died!
And he faltered: "How manyâ how many fell
'Neath Its folds, in the cannon's roar?
How many bled in the bailie red,
And the flag to victory bore?"
said the captain: "Nonet
'Tis the flair, my son,
Of the flrat brigade since the war!"
âAtlanta Constitution.
A STYLISH COSTUME.
The jacket basque is made in two distinct
ways, one with the skirt portion cut in one
with the body, the other with skirt portion
added. The waist Bhown here Is of the latter
class. This form is easier to mako than the
other and so recommends itself to home dress
makers. It is equally stylish; in fact is more
seen in handsome waists and jackets than is
the other. The sleeves are small, but not the
extreme of the mode.
A gown of black with blue boucle threads
bad a vest of blue chiffon with revers, stock
collar and bows of black satin. The narrow
belt was also of black satin. The ruche about
the neck was of blue chiffon.
A smooth cloth skirt of a deep reddish violet
shade had a waist of vioiet to match. The
revers and full front were of creaE y lace over
white satin, this being one of the most used
combinations for vests and revers of hand
some gowns. The lace is usually an open
mesh with applique designs, or of applique
above. A white satin stock collar with a large
bow at the back and a ruche of the same lace
finished the costume just described.
A skirt of black satin was worn with a waist
of taffetas having a black ground liberally
covered with flowers in shadowy tones of rose
colors with foliage in natural tints, and
myrtle green strips of satin over all. The vest
was of black moussellne de soie, with ap
pliques of creamy lace over green satin. The
revers were of green velvet. A white stock
collar of ribbon finished the neck.
A gown of tan cloth had vest and revers of
white satin heavily embroidered in gold. A
narrow belt of gold ribbon was worn. A gown
of green zlbellne had revers of green velvet,
with vest of creamy lace over white satin. The
belt was of gold disks.
CURIOUS FACTS ABOUT SILVER.
New York Mall and Express.
Dr. Edward Bedloe, ex-Consul to China,
made an interesting address before the Herbert
Spencer Club upon "Silver in the Far East."
He said: "The eastern mind is practical and
businesslike, and, in using silver as a medium
of exchange does so by weight. The expres
sion 'tael,' which you read about so fre
quently, is merely a weight and not a coin.
By doing this they give full play to the law of
supply and demand. It has fow advantages,
but many disadvantages. The chief disad
vantage is that the value changes from day to
day, and in doing any business with the civil
ized nations you are compelled to wait until
the price of silver, which is set in London, 1s
telegraphed by cable to the city you are in.
Every day, and even twice a day, these quo
tations irom the London silver market are
flashed into the furthermost corners of Japan,
Caina, India and the smaller silver countries
of the extreme Orient- Thus, if you are send
ing home $100 to your wife or daughter in
New York from Hong-Kong or Shanghai, it
cost you one day 195 silver dollars and the
Tiext day 197. Worse than this Is the gambling
based upon the fluctuation in the market.
Men buy and sell millions of silver for future
delivery. At one time the sDeculation was so
tremenaouÃ that almost every merchant in the
east was engaged upon it Finally, in 1891,
there came a crash, hundreds of firms, large
and small, were ruined, and millions of dol
lars were swept out of existence."

LABOR'S RESPONSIBILITY.
New y ork Press.
It is the power of the wage-earners of this
country to make the defeat of Mr. Bryan the
most overwhelming that ever has been admin
istered to a candidate for President. In every
State north of Mason and Dixon's line where
there is reasonable doubt as to the result of
the election the wage-earners will cast the de
ciding votes. It Is proper that it should be so,
for in this election the wage-earner haa more
at stake than any one else and his responsi
bility must be measured by what he does on
the day of election.
In the States of Maryland, Michigan, Vir
ginia, Missouri, Kentucky, California and In
diana tne votes of tbe wage-earners will turn
the scale; and here is their opportunity abso
lutely to wipe out Bryanlom, for with theae
Sin tts, or a part of them, carried for McKinley
Bryan's electoral vote would be so small as to
make him and his cause the objects of uin
sal ridicule.
Tno Press has no doubt that a majority of
tha wajie-earners of this country will vote fÂ»r
Mr. McKinley, just as it has no iluubt that lie
will be elected President. But the wage
earners can do more than assist In tbe elec
tion of Major McKinley; they can make the
deieat of Mr. Bryan a political mas-mere.
They can annihilate the silver conspirator*
and exterminate repudiation. And tnil It
what they must do. They must not be con
tent with merely defending, temporarily,
their wages against Mr. Bryan's plan to malca
their dollars buy ieÂ»a than they now buy.
They must not be satisfied with cneckii.g for
a season the attack upon their purchasing
power. They must make it l*por*lbla lor any
man in the present generation ever again to
aare assert that the doller which is paid to
labor must buy less than it now buys.

TRYING TO SAVE
THE UMATILLA
Members of the Crew Say
She Will Be a Total
Loss.
Firemen and Coal-Passers Driven
From Their Posts by
the Water.
BBAVERY OF THE OFFICERS.
Arrival of the Corwin With Some of
the Crew of the Wrecked
Wba'er Hidalgo.
The fate of the stranded steamer Uma
tilla seems to be in doubt. Sbe is hard
and fast on the beach, but the officers and
crew seem to differ as to the practicability
of getting her off. Captain C. Miner
Goodall and Captain Bennett say the
steamer can be floated, but the thirty
three men who came down on the Walla |
Walla say she cannot Every one of them i
is from the engineer's department and
they say that five minutes after the Uma
thla went over the rock they had to rush j
out of the fire hole or be drowned like
rats. Chief Engineer Lacy, who was at
his post and as cool and collected as
tnough in his own room, saved the steam
remaining in the boilers until the vessel
was run ashore.
The men say the rush of water was
something terrible. It seemed to flood
the engine-room in a few moments, and
before the firemen knew what was the
matter they were up to their waists in
water and the fires under the boilers were
out. Then the rush for the upper deck
began, but the chief barred the way.
When the situatiou was explained he al
lowed the men to pass and went below to
view the situation. lie came to the con
clusion that it was neck or nothing. With
a sinking ship and engine-room fuil of
water the men say that Captain Hunter
and Chief Engineer Lacy were the two
coolest men aboard the ship. Had they
not kept their heads the Umatilla would
nave cone down in deep water.
"The Umatilla did not strike," said
Mike Powers yesterday. "She went over
a submerged rock and it only stopped her
way for a moment. Then the engines
forced her alone and the plates that let in
the water like a millrace were torn out.
The steamer has an almost fiat bottom and
as she lies now the holes cannot be reached.
Heavy swells from the ocean are now due
and should they set in the Umatilla will
go to pieces inside of a week. When we
left tne deckhands were saving all the
cargo possible."
Captain Wallace of the Walla Walla
thinks the vessel can be saved if the fore
and aft holes are made water-tight and
pumped out. Then the Umatilla would
have buoyancy and the rent under the
boilers might be patched up. Captain
Bennett, superintendent of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company's docks, is of
the same opinion and says the steamer
will be running again inside of two
months.
On the 11th inst. the steamer Mexico,
that has been recently overhauled and
made into one of the finest vessels in the
fleet, will go out in place of the Umatilla.
Captain Jecsen will go out on her as mas
ter. He has been for years on the south
ern route, and with Hall and Alexander
shares the honors of being one of the most
popular and successful captains that have
been on the run. As a careful navigator
he cannot be beat. Captain Jepsen's place
on the Eureka will be taken by Captain
Conway of the Bonita, and the latter will i
be succeeded by Captain Andrew Hall, j
brother of the popular master of the j
Corona.
Harvey Jacobs of Santa Barbara and
George Neidiver of Monterey, two of the
best known otter and seal hunters on the
coast, are going out on a strange cruise.
They got in here on the Hermann, and
have invested $1500 in the venture. They
were paid off at the rate of $10 a skin, and
as soon as they got their money they
went to Kneass, the boat-builder, and had
two otter-huntine boats built to their
order. Tney are non-sinkable and fitted
for heavy weather.
The two hunters have purchased sup
plies for three months and will pack along j
a tent as well as two boat-pullers. From
here they will go to Monterey overland
and from that point will work the entire
American coast on the Pacific side. If
they meet with success and fill the boats
with ekins a run for a shipping port will
be made. If not the run will be con
tinued right down to South America.
The boats will be thoroughly equipped,
and every night when possible they will
be beached and the men will camp ashore.
Tney fully expect to take over 100 skins
inside of three months, and that means
at the least $5000.
The Point Arena arrived yesterday with
a full cargo of lumber instead of general
merchandise. It will be loaded into the
Mary C. Kuss and will go to Central
America for use on one of the railroads
now being constructed there.
One of the scow-schooners had a narrow
escape yesterday morning. Captain Alex
ander of the steamer Santa Rosa was feel
ine his way in in the fog when he suddenly
discovered the scow right in the fairway.
He at once ordered the engines reversed
and headed the Santa Rosa in-hore. He
got into the bight between Meigg* wharf
and Black Point, and had enough steam
way on to stop the vessel before bottom
was touched. It was a clever piece of sea
manship-
The United States revenue cutter
Thomas Corwin got in from Alaskan
waters yesterday. She brought down
Mate Wells and four men of the whaling
brig Hidalgo. As has already been re
ported, the vessel went ashore at Point
Hope and became a wreck. The men got
asnore July 26 last, and for two weeks
lived on pancakes and doughnuts. They
had sixty days' provisions, so were in no
fear of 3tarving. They were picked up by
the Bear and landed at Onalaska.
The log of the Corwin shows that since
leaving San Francisco she cruised 15,000
miles. The officers report that the Aleu
tian Islanas w- re covered with flowers
when they left; that the rookeries had
been depleted, and that at least 1000 bull
seals were without families. Bogoslof
Island, that was thrown up from the
ocean some years ago, has not yet hard
ened, and smoke ana lava still pour from
tne suriace.
Captain Freeman Trask has resigned
from the pilot service. Captain Dan
Haskell, the popular and skillful master
of the tug Fearless, is the most desirable
man for the place. * The pilot commission
ers will decide the matter in a few days.
A private letter states that three men
were lost overboard from the United States
revenue cutter Perry. No names were
given, but as the cutter is now at Astoria
the matter, if true, would have been re
ported long ago.

SONNTAG STEPS
DOWN AND OUT
And Keeps Himself Within
the Republican
Fold.
His Action Patriotic and Self-
Sacrificing and for
Harmony.
WRIT OF MAUD ATE WASTED.
Ned Foster, Sport and Theatrical
Man, Becomes Converted to
Republicanism.
Henry P. Sonntag has earned for him
self the gratitude and respect of all Re
publicans by withdrawing from the con
test for mayoralty on the ticket of the
Kelly-Mahoney faction. That he has re
tired in favor of the regular nominee,
C. L. Taylor, emphasizes the fact that
although Republicans may quarrel among
themselves for a while, they will always
be found in solid phalanx on the eve of
election.
Mr. Sonntag's action breathes the spirit
of true patriotism and self-sacrifice in the
interest of harmony.
Mr. Sonntag's letter was made pUDlic
yesterday. It is as follows:
San Francisco, Cal., October 1, 1896.
Alfred J. Morgenstem, Esq., Secretary of the
Regular Republican Municipal Conventionâ Dear
Sir: In considering the nomination for the
office of Mayor of San ' Francisco, tendered
to me by the Republican Convention of which
you are secretary, an honor which I highly
appreciate, 1 have concluded, in view of the
existing circumstances and against the pro
tests of my friends, to decline the same. Un
haprily there is a division in the ranks of the
Republicans at the present time in this City
relative to local nominations.
Every effort, consistent with self-respect,
has been made by tne convention of which
you are the secretary and of which I am the
chairman to harmonize the conflicting ele
ments and to unite the party in this City, so
that one ticket might be placed in the field in
the interest of good government. That we have
failed is to be deplored. The ticket presented
is one of great strength, and is entitled to re
ceive the support of the citizens of Ban Fran
cisco. In the event, however, of the adoption
of the new charter at the coming election and
its approval by the Legislature, that instru
ment would probably go into effect this com
ing July.
The Mayor under Jhat charter would be
vested with great power and responsibilities,
and would have the appointment of many
public officials. The election of a Mayor in
that event would be of great importance to the
Republican party of this City, and so, after
full consideration, I feel that I should not do
anything that might possibly jeopardize the
election of a Republican to that offlre, which
two Republican candidates in the field might
do, and I have, therefore, decided to step aside
in the interest of party unity, ana to subserve,
as I believe, the best interest of this City by
assuring the election of a Republican to that
office.
Colonel C. L. Taylor, an old and respected
citizen, who has filled many positions of public
trust with honor and fidelity, has been nomi
nated by one or more conventions of citizens
for that office. He is a Republican, and, in
my opinion, would make a conscientious and
able Mayor. I feel satisfied that if the geD
tlemen of the convention who to recently
showed their good will toward and confi
dence In me would nominate Colonel Taylor
in my place his election would be sure to fol
low. I hope my wish in this respect will be
gratified. I desire through you to thank the
gentlemen of the con>entlon for the honor of
the nomination, and, wishing success to the
Republic^ ticket, I am, very truly yours,
Hknbt P. Sohmtag.
WRIT OF MANDATE.
Mr. Farnsworth Asks the Supreme
Court for an Order.
Late yesterday afternoon D. L. Farns
worth, candidate for Superintendent of
Streets on tbe Keily-Mahoney ticket, filed
with the clerk of the Supreme Court a pe
tition for a writ of mandate to compel
Registrar Hinton to show cause why he
should continue to refuse to place the
Kelly-Mahoney nominations on the offi
cial ballot. A. Ruef is his attorney.
The contention of the petitioner is that
the National Committee is the supreme
and only authority in ward politics. The
date for hearing the matter will be set to
day.
James B. Brown, candidate of the same
people for Senator from the Seventeenth
Senatorial District, filed a petition for a
writ of mandate to have himself placed on
the official ballot.
A GOOD REPUBLICAN.
S. L. Lent Declines the Nomination
of the Independent Convention.
3. L. Lent, one of the nominees of the
Citizens' Independent Convention, has
addressed the following letter to the chair
man of that convention. It speaks for
itself:
Ban Francisco, Cal., Oct. 2, 1896.
Dr. George L. . Fitch, < hatrman Citizens' Inde
pendent Committee, 618 Spreckelt building, OUyâ
Dear Sir: I noticed In the Daily Call, under
date of September 26, 1896, that I had been
nominated by the Citizens' Independent Com
mittee for Assemblyman from the Thirty
fourth Assembly District.
In the absence of any otber notification, and
assuming that the publication referred to
states the fact in the case, 1 desire at this time
to f.dvise the Citizens' Independent Com
mittee, through you, of my withdrawal from
tbe contest, for the reason that tbe nomination
was not sought or desired on my part, and
being a Republican, my interest in the success
of that party prompts me in concluding that
so far as lies In my power my duty is tore
move every obstacle that tends in any way to
Interfere with it. Very respectfully,
S. L. Lbnt.
NED FOSTER CHANGES.
A Missouri Democrat, He Will Vote
for McKinley This Time.
Ned Foster, sport and theatrical man,
formerly proprietor of the Bella Union in
this City, has come out for McKinley and
protection.
Mr. Foster is a native of Missouri and
had been a stalwart Democrat since birth.
Last Thursday he was in the Buck
ley headquarters, and when asked to sup
port McDonald, one of the Democratic
nominees for Street Superintendent, re
plied that be proposed to work and vote
for the Republican ticket.
'If free silver win in this election the
country will go to ," ne said. "If we
had another Grover Cleveland in the
White House we'a go there anyhow. An
other reason I'm for McKinley is because
he is the brainieat man. Bryan pumps
too much wind to suit me."
While Mr. Foster was explaining his
change of heart very late last Thursday
evening in a saloon on tbe corner of Mason
and Eddy streets an enthusiastic Demo
crat whipped out a revolver, and with the
remark that he liked a man who spoke his
mind sent a bullet whizzing through the
floor. A policeman came in and Mr. Fos
ter informed him that some joker had ex
ploded a Chinese bomb.
CANDIDATES INDORSED,
United Labor Party Convention
Approves Republican
Nominees.
Stirring Addresses Were Made in
Favor of Good Municipal Govern
ment for the City.
A convention of the United Labor party
was held last evening at Smiiey's Hall,
111 Valencia street, there being delegates
present from each Assembly district, the
representation being upon the basis of
four delegates from each district. W. P.
Grace was elected chairman.
Mr. Grace made an address in which he
defined the purpose of the convention to
be to indorse only the best men for office
on the City and County ticket.
S. M. Williams, a well-known Republi
can, was unanimously elected secretary.
The convention indorsed C. L. Taylor

W. Elder, Justice Groezinger, Carroll
Cook, James A. Campbell and T. C.
Spelling as candidates for the positions

blyman from the Thirty-ninth District.
Messrs. Wetjen and Elder addressed the
convention, setting forth that San Fran
cisco needs a good government, and pledg
ing themselves to do all that they could to
secure it, if elected.
An executive committee was appointed,
consisting of James Bmiley, E. McCor
mick, P. A. Norton. A. G. de Vincent,
John Hayes, A. McDonealJ, J. W. Emer
ton and S. W. Williams.
This evening the convention will re
sume its deliberations and will indorse

ticket.
FEAST OF THE ROSARY
The Great Festival to Be Celebrated
To-Jlorrow at .St. Dominic's.
To-rxiorrow at St. Dominic's Church, in
this City, will be an occasion of unusual
interest to Catholic people. It is the
annual commemoration of the wonderful
victory of Lepanto gained by Christian
arms over the Turks in 1571, which is
credited to the prayers of the rosary. It
is likewise a day of thanksgiving for tbe
many favors obtained for society and in
dividuals through this great Dominican
devotion.
The order of solemn services commences
at 10 a. m. with the blessing and distribu
tion of roses, followed by solemn high
mass, at which there will be a sermon
delivered Dy Rev. Father O'Connor, O. P.
After the mass will take place the rosary
procession around the church block. Thfs
day is remarkable principally for the
great indulgence granted to tbe faithful of
the Catholic church, called tbe "Toties
Quoties."
This indulgence is an extraordinary
concession whereby those who are
contrite for their sina and have
ceived the sacraments may gain a plenary
indulgence each and every time a visit is
made to St. Dominic's Church from the
first vespers of the feast (2 o'clock Satur
day afternoon) till sundown on Sunday.

SHOT DOWN BY AN
ANGRY BOATMAN
Philip Reilly Is Mortally
Wounded by William
H. BrittaD.
The Assailant Had Attempted to
Take His Victim's Life
Before.
OUTCOME OF AN OLD FEUD
Wounded Man's Friends Unable to
Discover the Causes Which Led
Up to the Crimes.
Philip Reilly, a young man employed
as a carpenter by the State Harbor Com
missioners, was shot and fatally wounded
by William H. Brittan, a boatman, in
George Callaghan's saloon, Bay and
Powell streets, at 7 o'clock last evening.
The shooting was the result of an old
feud. Brittan and his victim met in the
saloon, and from the first it was evident
that the former was looking for trouble.
Reilly, accompanied by a friend, was
standing by the bar when Brittan walked
over and without warning struck at
Reilly. The blow was without effect,
however, and the two men clinched and
fell on the floor. Brittan regained his feet
and started for the door, apparently for
the purpose of making nis escape, but on'
reaching the street be turned and tired a
shot point blank at Reilly, who staggered
and fell to. the floor mortally wounded.
Brittan then ran up Bay street, but
encountered Harbor Policeman Ferguson,
to whom he surrendered himself. Fergu
son turned the prisoner over to Officer
Amos Williams, who took him to the
Central station to await the result of
Reilly's injury.
Brittan, with a spattering of Reilly's
blood on his left cheek, was surly and dis
agreeable.
"I don't want to talk about this thing to
any one just now. It will be time enough
by and by," were the only words he would
utter.
Heilfy was removed to the Receiving
Hospital. Dr. Stice attended the wounded
man. The bullet had entered immedi
ately sbovo the heart under the collar
bone, the left lung Oeing pierced.
Shortly after reaching the hospital, and
while he was being worked upon, Reiliy
became unconscious and his ante-mortem
statement was not obtained,
James Cunningham, a friend of Reilly's,
was present when the shooting occurred.
"Phil Reilly," said Mr. Cunningham,
"was returning from his work on the Har
bor Commisiioner's repairing gang. I
met him at Francisco and Powell streets,
within one block of his home, and we
stopped in at George Callaghan'B place to
get a drink.
"While we were there in conversation,
in came William H. BrittaD. He walked
over to where we were, and Reilly turned
round as if to greet him. He put out his
hand with a word of welcome, and Brit
tan, instead of accepting the friendly ad
vance, made a pass with his right fist, try
ing to knock Reilly down.
"Riley grabbed him, saying: 'Now,
Brittan, you know you can't hit me.' The
two scuffled a few minutes and both fell to
the floor, Reilly on top.
"Brit f an begged to be let up, and
shouted : 'Don' t hit a fellow when he's
down I'
"'Of course I won't hit you, Brittan,'
said Reilly, 'get up, old man, but don't
try to hit me again.'
"With that he rose from off Brittan and
we both backed out to the sidewalk. Brit
tan followed us closely and in the most
cold-blooded manner possible he pulled
his pistol and fired.
"Reilly staggered and almost fell on me,
saying: 'I'm shot, Jimmy; I'm gone.'
"I helped him to the nearest patrol box
while Brittan started off on a run toward
Bay street.
"It was a cold-blooded murder of an in*
offensive, good-natured man.
"Brittan, to my knowledge, has been
looking to kill Reiliy for at least a year.
1 was With Reilly at the time I allude to.
Brittan was lying in wait for him in a door
way, and as we came along the street he
jumped out at Reilly, trying to plunge a
knife into him.
"Reilly managed to avoid the blow and
as Brittan was being disarmed of bis
knife he drew a pistol and tried to hre
that. It was also taken from him."

INDIA NEEDS
MORE WHEAT
Threatened Famine Owing
to the Light Crop of
Last Year.
McNear and Eppinger & Com
pany Have Chartered
"Tramp" Vessels.
PRICES IN WHEAT GOING UP.
As Russia's Last Crop Was Quite
Light, This Country Will Reap
a Vast Benefit.
Shipping wheat to India sounds very
much like carting gold to California, but
wheat is what is now being shipped to In
dia from San Francisco.
George W. McNear and Eppinger & Co.
have lately chartered two "tramp" steam
ers, which will be loaded shortly and sent
either to England or India, presumably to
tbe latter place. The steamers are the
Glennesk and the Hermann Wedel Jarls
berg. The first has been chartered by Mc-
Near and the latter by Eppinger & Co.
The cause of this shipment of wheat to
India is plain. The last crop was very
scarce and the supply is now running out
and the last wheat crop of Russia is very
light. This explains the cinch the United
States seems in a fair way to have as re
gards the shipping of wheat both to Eng
land and Calcutta.
The Glennesk will be loaded first. As
soon as both vessels are loaded there is no
doubt but that they will sail directly for
Calcutta.
Both the firms mentioned say that the
ships will either go to England or Calcut
ta, but they profess no certain knowledge
on the subject. If they go -to England,
George W. McNear Jr. states they will
stop at St. Vincent, a port in the Cape
Verde Islands, where all vessels bound for
Europe receive instructions where to un
load their cargoes.
The two vessels, the Glennesk and the
Jarlsberg, are of the kind known as
"tramps," which have been cutting the
rates in regular vessels of traffic pretty
severely.
A junior member of the firm of Eppin
ger &, Co. admitted yesterday that in all
probability the ships will both be loaded
for Calcutta. Thus it seems that there is
a fortune for shippers that get the bulk of
tbe Indian orders.
Prices in wheat are now high. They
were lower yesterday, however, than the
day before. This is caused on account of
the demand in England and on the Conti
nent in general, borne dealers admit that
there is a good prospect of a famine in
India. This means that United States

THE WHEELMEN.
Langruetln Will Try for the World's
Five-Mile Record To-Morrow.
There is a lull in cycling circles this
week and there are few runs and no road
races scheduled for to-morrow. A great
deal of interest centers in the associated
clubs' annual ten-mile race to be held on
the 11th, and if all the men who are train
ing for it show up at the tape there will
be from 150 to 200 starter/. All the clubs
belonging to the association will have
men entered, fully thirty coming from the
Acms Ciub alone, whilejthe Bay Citys,
Olympics and Garden Citys will each put
in about twenty apiece. Next to the
eraat relay it is the event of the year and
Chairman Stratton of the racing board is
doing all in his power to have the arrange
ments so perfect that it can be properly
conducted.
The phenomenal time made by the Bay
City tandem riders last Sunday and God
dard's great unpaced performance are
still the talk of the clubs. A match tan
dem race between Kraft and Dixon, Grif
fiths and Davidson is" spofcen of, and it
would be a hot race, as each team thinks
it can beat the other, and both are confi
dent of lowering last Sunday's record.
Emil Lauguetin of the Bay City Wheel
men will try for the world's five-mile
paced road record to-morrow, paced by
the Kraft-Dixon. Griffiths-Davidson and
Vincent-Kanzee tandem teams, over the
San Leandro-Haywards course. Those
who should know think he will get the
record.
An invitation has been extended to the
Camera Ciub Cyclists by Sheriff Whelan
through Lieutenant Brunt to visit the
House of Correction to-morrow. Lunch
will be served, ana members will be ac
corded the privilege of taking photos of
the buildings, interiors and objects that
may interest them. Members are re
quested not to invite friends upon this
trip. The start will be from the Baker
street entrance to the park precisely at
hair- past nine.
Colonel Albert A. Pope, pioneer in the
manufacture of wheels and in the good
roads movement, is expected here next
week on a pleasure trip.
The Alpha (ladies')" Cycling Club held
a very enjoyable hop last evening at Hin
man's Hall, -in the Mission, which was
largely attended by their many friends.
The California Associated Cycling Clubs
will hold their regular bi-monthly meeting
to-night at the rooms of the Bay City
Wheelmen. The ten-mile road race on
the 11th and the theater party on the 21st
of this month are to be discussed.
Tne San Francisco Road Club and Cali
fornia Cycling Club members have a novel
affair on" for next week. Each night at
the Chutes a member from each club will
race against time on home-trainers for
five miles, prizes being awarded for the
best individual time, and the best average
performance of either club. Tne contest
will last a week and the members of the
two clubs are very mucn interested over it.
Entries for the ten-mile race close with
George H. Stratton, 501 Montgomery
street, next Monday, and the handicaps
will be announced by Thursday.
There will be a special meeting of the
Bay City Wheelmen to-night at 8 o'clock
to decide if the club shall participate in

Many were of the impression that Chief
Consul Kerrigan would not stand for re
nomination, but such strong pressure was
brought to bear upon him that he finally
consented. His administration during
the past year has been so successful that a
repetition of it is desired by tbe league
members, and the re-election of the entire
ticket is anticipated. Spaldixg.
GUN AND DOG.
Live Bird and Inanimate Target
Tournamentâ Preserves.
The State Sportsmen's Association met
yesterday at San Bruno and enjoyed a
first-class day's sport grassing live birds.
The particulars of the shoot will be found
in another department. The tournament
trill end with to-day, after which the asso
ciation will hold a business meeting at the
Palace Hotel.
On Sunday and Monday the Inanimate
Target Association will hold forth at San
Jote, and it poes without saying that the
greatest sport of the season will be wit
nessed when the crack shots from all over
the State will meet to decide the mooted
question of supremacy in inanimate target
shooting.
The president of the Sportsmen's Pro
tective Association has called a mass
meeting of sportsmen who are interested
in wild duck shooting, to be held on Tues
day evening at K. of R. B. Hall, Mason
and O'Farrell streets. The object of the
meeting is to discuss a decision that was
recently rendered by tne Bupreme Court
in favor of duck-shooting preserves. A
large attendance is expected.
E. J. Bell of Suisun writes that he will
have his hunting ark Mudhen anchored
in the Cordelia Slough, near the draw
bridge, on the 15th inst., for the purpose
of accommodating sportsmen who are de
sirous of a good duck-shoot. Donald McÃae
and F. Merkle have also engaged a mag
nificently fitted up ark for sportsmen,
which will be anchored between the draw
bridse and Teal station. The managers
contend that there are many acres of open
lands in the Suisun marshes on which ex
cellent duck shooting can be enjoyed.
Quail are said to be very plentiful this
season, but it would be advisable for hunt
ers to have tbe permission of the farmers
on whose property they intend to hunt
before entering upon inclosed grounds.
Farmers' rights should be respected.
Al dimming has just returned from the
mountain quail and grouse haunts in
Sierra County. Cumming, as an evidence
of his prowess with the gun, exhibited
about thirty-five grouse to friends who
met him at the depot.
"Well, you must have had a grand time,
Al," queried a friend who looked with
jealous eyes upon the dead and beautiful
game. The sportsman answered in the
affirmative, and without cracking a 16 to 1
smile said that he had grassed them all
himself and would have done better had
it not Deen for his gun, which kicked
against greater slaughter. Al's dogs,
Dude and Dudeen, assisted very materi
ally in discovering the hiding-places of
wounded birds, otherwise the bag of
grouse would have been comparatively
small. Each time that Cummines men
tions anything about wounded birds his
best friend, "Dude," wags bis tail as much
as to say, "Had it not been for me, pap,
where would yon have landed, anyhow?"
But Al thinks all the world of his shaggy
children, nevertheless.
The following letter to Thb Call from
Game Warden Donovan of Alameda
County speaks for itself:
San leandbo, Sept. 29, 1896.
Sporting Editor The Morning Callâ Sib: While
traveling through the county performing the
duties of my office I will say, for the benefit of
hunters, it appears to me that quail will be
very plentiful in Alameda County this year,
and if hunters continue to respect the law as
tney have been doing they will be amply re
warded when the season opens. There also
seems to De an unusually large number of
young ducks around the marshes, especially in
the vicinity of Mount Eden and Alvarado.
1 have just stocked the Alameda Creek above
the forks of tne Calaveras and Alameda creeks
with 50.000 Lake Tahoe trout.
During tne month of September I arrested
three violators of the fish law. They were con
victed and fined $50, $20andf20 respectively.
Yours respectfully, J. L. Donovan,
Fish and Game Warden Alameda County.
A warrant was issued by Judge Conlan
yesterday for the arrest of L. Sattena, a
commission merchant at 10 Washington
street, for having wild ducks in bis posses
sion out of season and exposing them for
sale. Game Warden Morgan found forty
nine wild ducks in Sattena's store early
yesterday morning.
THE ANGLERS.
Good Fishing In Russian River.
Some Catches of Sea Fishes.
The angling season is fast drawing to a
close. John Butler and company are not
meeting with very flattering success on
the Eel River. The fall run of steelhead
has not put in an appearance, but the
disciples of salmon roe and spoon expect
to "strike" it lucky before their departure
from Humboldt County. It is presumed,
however, that if an experienced flycaster
was among tbe pleasure-seekers several
good catches of twelve-inch steelhead:
would be recorded before now.
G. W. Morgan of Duncans Mills writes
to the sporting editor that black bass fish
ing is better now than ever, but that the
striped bass are hard to catch, notwith
standing there are quite a number of
good size in tbe river. The steel heads
have made their appearance in tbe Rus
sian River, and during the past week sev
eral nice fresh run fish that average trom
two to five pounds in weight have been"
taken by the spoon fishermen. Mr. Mor
gan says that the hardheads are a great
annoyance, as they dash at a spoon the
moment it makes its appearance among
them. Net fishermen report a large run
of steelheads and striped bass near the
mouth of the river.
Mr. Tilley of the mail service has just
returned from Redondo Beach ana states
that he had great sport catching yellow
tails, the largest of which scaled eighteen
pounds. The angler used a drop line from
the railway company's wharf and the bait
employed for tbe capture of the yellow
boys was a mackerel twelve inches in
length. Tilley left yesterday for Point
Snr in Monterey County..
The steamer Vigilant will take a large
number of excursionists to-morrow on a
fishing trip to Farallon Islands. The
steamer has been chartered by the Knights
of St. Patrick. P. F. McCormick and D.
E. Condon will have charge of those who
intend "heaving to" when time comes for
the feeding of the fishes.
Georgie, "the Greek," monarch of fish
ermen's wharf, took out a select gathering
of anglers Sunday morning on his flag
ship "Uncle Sam." There was Dr. Al
Hoge and his son, Walter, a lad of 17, who
has already made a name as the champion
ceiling-waiter of the Olympic Club. There
was also Dick Armstrong, tbe stockbroker.
Finally, there was George Gunther, the
crack fisherman, and Dr. Armistead, to
make up the party.
The craft was headed toward Blossom
Rock, where it was found that the waters
were overhunted by seals and the fish
were scarce in consequence. The party
caught roctc and blue cod under the Alca
traz forts, just enough for a tasty "chip
pino."
CRICKET CHIRPS.
The Wlndup of the SeasonâAustra
lians Against Californlan9.
The coming of the Australian team is
the one topic of conversation among local
cr icketers. The latest news and arrange
ments for the match to be played here on
their arrival will be found in another col
umn.
The Hunter Harrison cup contest,
though not played to a finish, is practi
cally decided. The Bohemian team, which
leads, is depicted in the accompanying
cut, ana is composed of the following
players: W. Robertson (captain), H. H.
Cookson, A. Reynolds. W. Reeves, A. W.
Lugg, S. B. Martin, E. A. L. Bmitb, George
Pollock and V. P. Irwin. E. A. Aitken is
the umpire.
W. Coates, ex-captain of the Penryn
Colony club, has returned to his home
after an enjoyable vacation in this City.
The matches to-morrow are between the
Alamedas and Califomias at Alameda ana
the Pacifies and Bohemians at Golden
Gate. _ Umpire.
THE OARSMEN.
The Charges Against the South End
Crew Are Contradicted.
The outlook for a reeatta on Oakland
Creek on Thanksgiving day is very en
couraging, and although the affair is yet
in a premature state crews and single
scullers are already getting in shape for
the contests.
The following is an extract from the
Stockton Record in regard to the alleged
bribery of oarsmen:
"That it was Deing fixed as much as
possible to have the South Ends win out,
not the least doubt in the world remains,
but on the honor of the members of the
Pacific Athletic Association it can be said
that they had no hand In the matter
whatever. The South Ends went into the
race to win honestly and fairly and that
they were beaten was only because they
had met better men."
The Record's article should tend to
eliminate the feeling that has been in

have recently been looked upon as fakirs.
The Olympic Club boating annex held a
jinks at their new boatbouse last Sunday,

crew. They are: F. A. Grimm, bow and
captain; J. Morton, forward waist; Bert
Collins, afterwaist; Jim McElroy, stroke,
ana Doc Flynn, coxswain.
Next Sunday the South End Club will
have a series of trial races in their new
skiffs.
There is a rumor afloat that Dr. Cecil
Dennis, the crack skiff rower of the Ala
meda Boating Club, is about to join the
South End Rowing Club.
The Pioneers wish it known that they
are not in the "nÂ»ud." Tbey will enter
two crews in the coming regatta, a single
sculler, Conez Ochs, afterwaist of the
senior crew, and George Callop and Fred
Orr in the outrigger skiff.

FOOTBALL.
Berkeley Match With Reliance To-
Dayâ Weights of Two Varsities.
The first of the season's games among
the "big four" teams will be played at
Central Park this afternoon between the
University of California Varsity and the
Reliance eleven. Game will be called at
2:30.
The match will be interesting in a com
parative way for the line it will give on
the games to follow. It is thought that
Reliance has the advantage thus early in
the season over Berkeley. In practice last
week with the Stanford team Reliance
did not score or permit the Palo Alto men
to make a touchdown.
Berkeley's line is yet unsteady, while
Reliance with Oliver, guard, Burnett, cen
ter, and Sexton, tackle, has probably the
three strongest men ou the coast for those
positions.
Olympic has been practicing faithfully
throughout the week, and has gained two
new candidates in Conde Jones for fnll
back and Snowden, an ex-Stanford
pitcher, for a most promising end or half.
Stickney, the old Harvard player, though
acting as coach, will play with the Olympic
team.
On Monday and on two other evenings
of next week Berkeley will play practice
games witn Olympic at Central Park.
The public will not be admitted.
Tommy Code, who was to have tried
for tackle on the Olympic team, will
coach one of the big teams ot the North
west, but hopes to be back, if needed, for
the Reliance - Olympic championship
match.
From the following football material
two Varsity elevens are to be formed for
the sixth annual intercollegiate match.
What are thought to be the more promis
ing candidates for each position are
named first, but with no attempt at order
of merit in the others. As near as pos
sible the correct stripped weights are
given. The relative merits of the candi
dates for each team, as well as their in
dividual weights, are, of course, likely to
change a Jittie during the next seven
weeks of the training season, and men
now trying for one position may prove
better fitted for another:

session, all killed within an hour. He also
states that the quail are very plentiful on tne
Yolo side of the river. The Warden also re
ports that the yellow perch and black bass
planted in Sims and Grapevine lakes, below
the city, are undoubtedly doing well, as he
had a close watch kept for dead fish and not
one has been found.
The fish planted at Folsom are also doing
well and are frequently seen in the clear water
of the lakes. He reports the river as teeming
with salmon, and he has strong suspicions
that poachers are abroad.
It was boxing night at the Sacramento Ath

RAPHAEL PROVES
AN EASY WINNER
Trailed the Colors of Jack
Savage in the
Dust.
One of the Cleverest Feather
weight Contests Witnessed â¢
in This City.
A LOCAL LAD THE VICTOR.
Graduated From Amateur Pugilism by
Besting an Imported Fighter
With a Record.
Frank Raphael, a San Francisco lad,
graduated last night from the ranks of
amateur pugilism to the plane of the pro
fessional slogger with honor to himself,
glory to his Btate and profit to his back
ers. In eight fast, exciting and stubbornly
fought rounds, he succeeded in trailing in
the dust the colors of Jack Savage, the
imported feather-weight, with a record
won in and brought over from Australia.
It was Raphael's first professional ap
pearance in the ring, and though he held
the amateur lightweight championship of
the Pacific Coast, even his most ardent ad
mirers had some little misgivings over the
result of his encounter with a fighter of
experience and one who boasted of an ex
cellent record in Australia.
Raphael bad but a week in which to
train, and even daring this period did not
cease to perform his regular duties at his
place of employment Bettine the day
before the fight was considerably in favor
of the visitor, and for this reason the
backers of the clever fighter of home pro
duction were the more jubilant over the
victory.
About a thousand admirers of trained
brawn and muscle were present at the ex
hibition of the Columbia Athletic Club
last night at the People's Palace. The
great attraction of the evening was tne
eight-round fisticuff match between Frank
Kapnael and Jack Savage, the latter
better known as "Yank," lor a purse ot
$3000. When weighed at noon each turned
the scales at just L 26 pounds, and both
were in condition to thoroughly satisfy,
in every particular, their respective sec
onds and backers.
Louis Myers opened the evening's pro
gramme with a display of clever club
swinging, and was followed by Billy Dun
nigan and Billy Cook, who killed time for
the spectators by some lively sparring in a
three-round go.
J. Spiro, A. Brill, J. Meagles and J.
Davis were the next to appear, and were
introduced ascatcb-as-catch-can wrestlers.
There were four falls in all. Meagles was
first pitted against Davis. The former
won in a few minutes after some clever
work, notable among which was a head
pivot that would have done credit to a
professional ground tumbler.
Spiro and Brill proved to be two ath
letes of somewhat larger proportions than
the first two, and their work was not
nearly so lively nor so clever. Spiro
proved the victor in short order. In the
next round between Meagles and Davij
the latter won, and in the last go Brill
scored a fall. Thus honors were fairly and
agreeably divided. Brill's victory was
won largely with the aid of his legs, which
,he succeeded in clasping around the necs
of his adversary, who had formed a bridge.
Spiro was Kept in this position until hi 3
neck and back muscles could stand the
strain no longer. Then his shoulders
sank to the ground, and the affair was
over.
There was to have been a six-round
glove contest between Arthur Hawkins
and Jack King, but owing to a hitch in
the arrangements this event was declared
off.
At 8 minutes past 10 o'clock time
was called for the first round of the big
event. Dan Whealin acted as timekeeper
for the club, Bob Haley performed the
same duty for Raphael and Bob Harris for
Savage. B'lly Smith was referee. The
seconds of Raphael were Alex Greggains,
Charlie Rochette and Vincent White, and
Savage's seconds were Jimmy Farley,
Jimmy Anthony and Charlie Gough.
Long - distance fiddling and drawing
were the features of the first minute of the
first round. Each was wary and cautious,
seeding apparently to discover some open
ing without danger of a counter. Then
Raphael led off with and landed lightly
with his left on the right cheek of the man
from the Antipodes. There were some
quicK exchanges, but no damage was
done. There was some more long-range
sparrine and Raphael again toot the ag
gressive, but got a clip on the neck and
another in the face for his temerity, but
without in the least being affected there
by. At one time Savage crowded his op
ponent rather closely, but just before time
was called the local lad got in his right
and left in quick succession.
The second round proved to be one of
the hottest of the contest, both men in the
beginning seeming hungry for work.
Raphael, however, maintained the aggres
sive, but his adversary was not slow to
respond. There were numerous quick
and vigorous exchanges, and towaid the
end of the round Savage was kept busy
getting away from a connection with
Raphael's mitts.
In the third and fourth rounds there
was little to call forth encouragement
from the spectators, but the ffitf t h was a
"corker." Raphael had apparently gauged
his man and was more than ever aggres
sive. He landed whenever and wherever
he pleased and virtually made a chop
ping-block of Savage. The latter took bis
punishment bravely and in many cases
made some clever counters, but there was
no steam in his delivery.
SDurred on by his experience in the pre
ceding round, Raphael rushed the sixth
round from the jump, but Savage had re
covered from the hot rally of the fifth and
showed up well in this and in the succeed
ing round, though compelled to take con
siderable punishment.
The eighth and last round opened with
a lead by Raphael. Savage then took
things in hand, and for a few seconds kern
the San Francisco boy moving about at a
lively rate. Then Raphael started in in
earnest, and for the remainder of the
round swung his right and left at frequent
intervals with telling effect. Savage
showed cleverness as before in countering
but could not evade Raphael's quick and
strong delivery, nor could he land with
any force.
At the conclusion of this round the fight
was awarded to Raphael amid the wild
howhng and cheering of the whole house.
Raphael was immediately surrounded
by friends and carried to his dressing
room, where, as some one remarked he
did not seem to have been doing enoueh
fighting to get warmed up. There was
not a mark or blemish to show that the
recent amateur had gone through eight
rounds of a sharp battle with a profes
sional pugilist of experience and consider
able renown.
AUSTRALIANS COMING.
But the Big Matches Will Be Played
Independently of the Cricket
Association.
A meeting of the California Cricket As
sociation was held last night and attend
ed by the following delegates: H. H.
Cookson and W. R. Robertson Bohemian
SSb; E. B. Hosue and I L T. Randall,
Alameda Club; G. Theobald and R. H.
Delafield, Pacific Club, and Dr. J. Calvert,
California Club.
The object of the meeting was to take
action in regard to a projected match with
action, however, having been iÂ° rest Â£, le Â£
by W. R. Robertson, a Bohemian Club
delegate, who stated that be had com
pleted all arrangements for the match on
his own responsibility, nothing was done
in the matter, and the patronage of the
association was withheld. The match
will be played at the Presidio grounds oa
the 14th and 15th, and will doubtless at
tract the attention of every cricket lover
in tbe country ; but it will not be played
under the auspices of the association.
Permission was asked by and granted
to the various cluos to arrange matches
with the Penryn cricketers, who will visit
San Francisco toward the end of the pres-
ent month.
PTOMAINES IN THE MILK.
A Dozen Periona Made Sick by Drinking
from an Unclean Can.
Neglect to keep a milkcan clean caused
the serious illness of twelve persons in the
neighborhood of Sutler and Taylor streets,
as reported in The Call yesterday. One can
was left at John Becker's grocery-store in
that locality that morning.
Herbert F. Dugan, who is the druggist
at the corner of Sutter and Taylor streets,
analyzed some of the milk tbat made the
ladies of his family so ill and was unable
to find the evidence of any corrosive poi
"I only gave it a chemical test," said
he, "but my examination was close enoueh
to determine accurately that the milk was
only sour. I foand no traces of mineral
poison, but the presence of ptomains, or
"cadaveric Doison," which was caused by
tbe decomposition of the albumen in the
milk.
"A large quantity taken into the system
would cause, if other conditions were
favorable, death.
"I think all the trouble came from tha
unclean condition of the can."
Dr. Davis tested the milk with litmus
paper, which immediately turned red
upon being immersed in the liquid, denot
ing the presence of acid there. Dr.
Bunker obtained the same result. All of
the patients are recovering.

Â«T DON'T FEEL BAD, BUT IF I GO

This is the way thousands of young men
explain the matter. - : It is serious. There
was a time when nothing was excess â they
could stand anything, but now. the slight-
est exertion "is excess, and "plays them
out."
What is excess, to-day will cause nervous
prostration inside of two years, because the '

vital, recuperative force is daily growing
less, and will in time give out completely.

WRANGLE OV2R LEGISLATORS
A County Committee Appointed, With
Full Powsr to Act for the
Convention.
With the exception of two names the
Non-Partisans completed their ticket last
night. The business was concluded with
a dispatch which spoke volumes for the
adroitness of the powers, visible and in
visible, which swayed the destinies of the
convention. The attendance was so small
that the lecture hall of the Academy of
Sciences, small as it is, had a deserted,
lonesome look.
Barclay Henley reported that the Ju
diciary Committee had decided not to
propose any one for nomination to the
office of District Attorney, leaving the
nomination to th c convention at large.
Jeremiah Lynch of the committee on
legislative nominees, presented the fol
lowing report:
Your committee on legislative nominees beg
leave to submit for your consideration the tol
lowing candidates from the various Senatorial
and Assembly districts.
The only way, however, iv which we have
allowed the Senatorial question to interfere
has been in the division of candidates between
the parties. The candidates here named have
been divided equally between the two National
parties, in one district only ihe Republicans
adopting at Populist- Republican, Calvin S.
Ewing.
The Republicans have been given two Sena
tors and trie Democrats three and the Republi
cans ten Assemblymen and the Democrats
eight. In order that the best effect may be
given to the moral influence of our indorse
ment, Republicans have been recommended in
Republican districts and Democrats in Demo
cratic districts.
All the candidates upon this list have signed
the following pledge:
Ban Fbaxcisoo, October 1, 1896.
I hereby promise that If X am elected to the
Legislature I will by my vote and influence en
deavor to secure the adoption of the new charter
In its entirely au.l without amendment by the
Legislature. And I also promise ibat I will, by
my rote and influence, prove, t the passage of
any leeisiaiive enactment that shall in any man
ner impair tne usefulness or destroy the efficacy
of the present Australian bal.ot law, or the so
called purity of election law.
And I lurlher pledge myself not to vote for any
candidate for the United states Senate who will
not pledge himself to vote against any bill in the
United States Senate having for its purpose the
refunding of the indebtedness of the l'acilic rail
ways.

Gately (D.).
Warren Gregory opposed any nomina
tions of candidates to the Legislature. He
contended it was out of the province of
the convention, since it had been organ
ized for the purpose of reforming munici
pal government, and not for dealing with
State and National issues.
Mr. Henley urged that the legislative
nominations proceed. He contended that
it was of the greatest importance tbat ail
possible efforts should be put forth to
secure the election of candidates pledged
to support the new charter.
Mr. Le Breton took exception to John
G. Tyrell, candidate from the Twenty
third" Senatorial, and George K. Fitch
gave a history of municipal affairs in San
Francisco to prove that it was the duty of
the convention to secure pledged nomi
nees to the Legislature.
Other delegates spoke at great length,
until Mr. Ellert moved that the legisla
tive nominations proceed, and it was bo or
dereJ.
On motion of Mr. Lynch the report read
by him was adopted, with the exception
i hat the names of John G. Tyrrell and
Leon Dennery were expunged from the
Jist of nominees, Mr. Le Breton remark
ing:
"We don't want anything 1o do with
Jiennery. He has given uv a lot of trouble
already" fccratch him out."
The report was adopted unanimously,
with the exception of Frederick W. Zeile,
who shouted :
"I vote ' 2* o' in order to show my con
tempt for the action of the convention in
this matter. It we continue in this way
we wil! make ourselves ridiculous. We
should not mix City politics with State
and National affairs. I shall oppose any
motion having a tendency in that direc
tion."
And thus, with the substitution of M. J.
Welch for Mr. Tyrrell, and two blanks,
one caused by the elimination of the name
of Mr. Dennery, the list was voted on as a
whole and the candidates nominated
' unanimously in the twinkling of an eye.
Mr. Henley presented a resolution point
ing to the spoils system as the root of all
municipal evil and advocating civil ser
vice in the City government. This was
adopted.
Another resolution giving to the County
Committee full power to rill vacancies on
the ticket was also adopted.
The following resolutions, introduced
by Frtfnk J. Sullivan, wero also carried :
Whereas, The Superior Court of every city
and county in the State of California may ap
point court commissioners, whose Juties are
defined by section 259 of the Code oi Civil
Procedure,
Resolved, That it Is the sense of this conven
tion that our nominees lor Superior Judges
shall in no case vote to appoint or to retain
any attorney who is a partner or employe of
any legal firm as such court commissioner;
Resolved, That this convention will require
written assurances from its nominees to that
effect.
On motion of L. E. Ellert, the nomina
tion for Supervisor from the Sixth Ward
was next taken up, the candidates being
John Lachmann and Attorney Henry E.
Monroe. The vote stood 31 to 9in favor
of the first-narnea nominee, and Mr. Lach
mann'a nomination was declared unani
mous.
Mr. Lynch reported that Elliott Mc-
Allister and William A. Plunkett had re*

WORKERS FOR SUFFRAGE.
Employes In Factories and Foundries
to Be Addressed During Lunch.
The bright new banner waving across
Market street attracted many visitors to
the Woman Suffrage Bureau yesterday.
In the forenoon the joint campaign
association held a large and enthusiastic
meeting, Mrs. A. A. Sargent presiding.
Reports from all tbe precinct presidents in
the City and State were read, and the out
look was judged more than promising.
The committee decided in favor of in
formal meetings to be held during the
lunch hour in the vicinity of the various
factories, foundries and other places where
large numbers of men are employed.
While disposing of the contents of their
lunch-pails, the men will have a chance to
hear some sound speeches on political
equality, and to receive a few simple in
structions as to the right way to vote.
The bureau haÂ« just received from the
printers a large stock of woman-suffrage
literature in pamphlets and leaflets. The
main arguments in favor of the cause are
ably and concisely stated, and tbe demand
for the little messengers of political
equality is large and constantly increas
ing.

be among the attractions.
MRS. MILLS' EXPERIENCE
Friends Call to Grieve With
Her Over Her Son's Re
ported Death.
She Was Condoled With During Sev
eral Hours, but Arthur Mills
Was Not Dead.
Mrs. Susan Mills, who lives at 707 Shot
well street, near Twenty-first, bad a sin
gular and very unpleasant experience last
evening. Her son, Arthur Mills, was
badly hurt in Â«3 accident Thursday even
ing while riding on an electric car on the
Mission-street line. The motorman per
mitted the car to collide with a cart loaded
with iron pipe and Mills was struck by the
pipe. He is well Known about town, be
ing in the insurance business and em
ployed by Montgomery Briggs on Cali
fornia street
The news that he was hurt was pub
lished in The Call yesterday morning.
All day callers went to the Mills home to
express regret. Late yesterday afternoon
the rumor spread about that Mills had
died from his injuries. This startling
news brought gr"ief-stricken friends of the
young man who met his mother with
trembling voices and tearful eyes. It gave
Mrs. Mills a shock to hear trie friends say
that her boy was dead, and when this was
repeated several times she was much de
pressed, although she knew that he lives
and will probably recover.
But all through the evening mourning
friends and relatives arrived to extend
condolence. Mrs. Mills spoke last night
of the shock which nad been given her.
She said that her son, who is her principal
support, will recover if blood-poisoning
does not set in. His escape was narrow.
He was badly cut and lost a great deal of
blood. His friends will begin a suit
against the Market-street Railway Com
pany for damages, claiming that the acci
dent could easily have been avoided. Four
or five persons other than Mills were in
jured more or less. A young man named
Jones, who lives on San Carlos avenue,
nad his back hurt and yesterday hobbled
about half doubled up. His injuries are
less serious than the hurts of Mills.
The Sliver Question and Hard Times.
John J. Valentine, president of "Wells,
Fargo & Co., contributes a masterly article
to this week's News Letter on the above all
absorbing topic. The free-silver fallacy is
made so apparent by this writer's able
reasoning that no voter should fail to re
fresh his mind by perusing the facts so
ably set forth therein. Mr. Valentine's
former articles on the money question
have been copied everywhere. This arti
cle will undoubtedly be as much appre
ciated as the others were.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1869.
HOW THE HUNDREDS
WERE NOT HEALED
Schrader, the Divine, and
His Great Sale of
Photographs.
It Is Estimated That His Agent
Takes In at Least $40
an Hour.
BLESSING AT FULL SPEED.
A Rush of A 1 Manner of Peopls to
the Alleged Healerâ Blind and
Lame and Deaf.
The atmosphere for blocks about the vi
cinity of the International Hotel yester
day breathed of disease. The sidewalks
rattled with the sound of crutchesâ the
The Divine Healer Continues to Attract Hundreds of Ailing Folks
in Search of Relief. A Brisk Traffic in His Photos Is Carried
On by a Business Agent. So Far No Cures Are Officially-
Reported.
lame seeking a charm that miclit enable
them to walk erect.
If there be some individual in this great
City who believes that the age of simplic
ity and credulity has passed by let him
visit the International Hotel while Schra
der, the "Divine Healer, " remains there
going through his pantomime of blessing
and healing. The throng of unfortunates
that have stood in line for the past three
days waiting to be blessed and cured have
not the assurance presented them of a sin
gle cure. Despite the uninterrupted suc
cession of failures, however, the line of
waiting invalids constantly lengthens, the
crowd at the door increases, and the mar
vel of it is that every man ana woman in
the throng geeraa to be there with the
most profound faith â with no thought
whatever that they arc being imposed
upon.
The "healer" yesterday moved to new
but adjacent quarters. His business was
so large that it materially interfered with
the business of the hotel, and he was re
quired to make newarrrangements. There
is, or has been, a vacant storeroom in the
block and he engaged this. A large plain
table was placed in the farther extremity
of the room and at one end of it and in
the corner of the room the "healer" took
his stand. At the othfer end of the table,
at the other corner of the room, the
â¢'agent," with a large, leather, open
mouthed bag full of photographs, took his
stand.
The door was opened and a gruff, loud
voiced man ordered the people to keep in
line one behind the other, and thus they
marched to the corner where stood the
man who had made himself up to look
like Christ. A passing of the hand over
the forehead, a touch on the breast and on
the stomach, a clasping of his hands over
the handkerchief, a looking upward for a
brief instant, and then the sufferer was
passed on to the agent with his photo
graph for sale. Every individual was re
quired to pass out behind the long table
at the end of which was the tradesman.
Yesterday the photograph dealer put a
price upon bis wares â that is, he had
at limit on the minimum. %
When the sufferer approached the man
with the photographs, the latter inquired
if he would not buy. The sufferer in
quired the price. If the man or woman
wore the appearance of having indefinite
sums of money the answer would be,
"Anything you choose to give."
If, in response, the sufferer chose to give
10 cents, the agent would brusquely re
fuse, declaring that the cards cost 12 cents.
If the afflicted person wore the appear
ance of carrying little coin and there was
therefore no expectation of receiving a
larger sum the agent would, to the ques
tion of cost, answer directly, "25 cents."
The photographs are of cabinet size,
roughly made by an unknown New York
photographer, and, as everybody knows,
â¢may be bought Jn quantities for 3 cents
eacr,.
Not more than one in ten passed with
out purchasing. According to a count be
gun at 2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, it
just took thirty-two minutes for 100 per
sons to -pass. The "healer" made quick
work of it yesterday. In this count oi half
an hour there were two persons on crutches
and two blind, one deaf,, one with a stiff
and deformed arm and one young woman
with a hand grown to the size of a base
ball catcher's mitten. Each of these cases,
the ailment being so apparent, were given
extra time so that this count would stand
for a fair average of the day. According
to this count â the number passing and the
sales of photographsâ the revenue must
have netted $10 an hour for more than
eight hours. This makes no allowance
for the dollars and even $5-pieccs that are
often handed to the agent.
The coat-pocKet of the salesman where
he kept tbe coin bulged out like an open
mallbaK and was so heavy that it dragged
the coat down to one side and threw the
man and the garment badly out of poise.
But still the chink of the falling coin
went on, and the soft-voiced man with
the rapt, prayerful expression kept pass
ing the purchasers along. All of them
seemed satisfied, however â there is that
to be said. They had been bles/ed and
seemed to feel that they had received their
moneys worth. The Kearny-street cars
did a big business carrying cripples and
the blind and the inhrm. But those who
had to pay car fare to reach the place
were also compelled to pay the corpora
tion to carry them away â for they were
not made able to walk. Not a few un
hrppy people hobbled along on their
crutches both to and from the place, with
as much difficulty returning as going to
the healer.

BANCROFTS ARE LENIENT.
They Will Not Prosecute Their Old but
Recreant .Employe.
O. C. Richards of the Bancroft Company
has decided not to prosecute the employe
who stole about a ton of the history plates
and sold them to a local firm. Speaking
of the matter last night, Mr. Richards
said:
"I have become convinced that an out
side party, once employed by the firm, is
the real criminal. He will probably be
arrested soon, but I think there are rea
sons why we will let the old employe,
whose wife died, go free. He has been a
man of sorrow.
"The other plates stolen were Pelton's
'Sunbeams and Shadows.* There was a
scheme to sell the history plates and other
valuable works at 3 cents a pound."
It requires a good deal of faith to doubt.

Richmond Parents Protest That the
Health of Their Children Is
in Danger.
An adjourned meeting of the Board of
Education was held last nisÂ»ht.
The Committee on Rules' report was
adopted, to the effect that Miss Kate F.
Quinlan be granted a leave of absence
from October 5 to October 10.
The report of the Committee on Judi
ciary was referred to tne committee of the
whole board. It represented that the
Farallone Islands are within the City and
County limits of San Francisco, and that
if there are the necessary number of chil
dren on these islands they are entitled to
a school with the same effect as if they
were in the City proper. There are sev
eral applications for the position of teacher,
and as the United States lighthouse offi
cials on the islands have stated in their
petition for a school that there is a suffi
cient number of children there it is be
lieved a school will be established on the
bieak Farallones.
The Committee on Salary recommended
that the salary of Mrs. Mayberry, teacher
of sewing in the Irving Scott Primary
School, be fixed at $50 a month; that the
salary of Miss Anna Love of the Starr
King" Primary School be $83 a month ; that
of tne principal of the Horace Mann Even
ing School be $75, and of Miss Mary W.
Busteed, principal of the Fairmount Even
ing School, be $60 a month. The report was
adopted.
Superintendent Babcock submitted an
amendment to section 169 of the rules,
which refers to tbe appointment of pro
bationary teachers.
His recommendation was that if snch
teachers be finally elected they shall not
be dismissed, except after a fair hearing,
and only for violation of the rules of the
Board of Education, or for incompetency,
insubordination, profanity, intemperance,
unprofessional or immoral conduct. The
amendment was adopted.
The petition from the people of the
Richmond district was read as follows:
We, the undersigned citizens and taxpayers
residing iv the Eighteenth Precttict of the
Thirty-eighth Assembly District, respectfully
ask you to consider the following petition:
Our children, who are In the first, second and
third standards, have been attending the
school situated upon the corner of Geary street
and First avenue, which is only six short
blocks from here, but they are now requested to
attend the Park School, situated on Sixth
avenue, near Fulton street, which is about
eleven long blocks from here; and whereas,
tbe children are all very small, they will also
have to go for five blocks along a sidewalk
which skirts the edge of a high, dangerous
and totally unprotected embankment of the
old racetrack, alter which they will have to
cross two dangerous car-tracks, viz., the Geary
and Sacramento. We, therefore, respectfully
ask you to allow our children to attend the
Geary street and First avenue school as here
tofore, as the school is very much nearer,
free from danger in going and returning,
more suited to the children and agreeable to
ourselves.
Another petition signed by residents of
various parts of the district praying for
prompt action regarding the Sixth-avenue
School was read. It stated that heaps of
manure were piled near the schoolhouse
and that there was no outlet for the sewer,
by which the children's health was
menaced.
Director Henderson replied that the
building stood on sand and its sanitary
condition was perfect.
A letter from the Point Lobos Improve
ment Club asking for postponement of
action on the matter was read by the
Superintendent. The board deferred ac
tion for another week.
The Committee on Rules recommended
that Mrs. Nettie R. Craven be granted
leave of absence for six months from
October 1, 1896, to April 1, 1897.
â¢'Mrs. Craven has been sick for six
months or more," said Director Murdock,
"and she has not been at the school for a
long time. It might be a quite graceful
thine for her to resign, so that the school
be put in proper hands. For myself, I
don't feel like patting a mortgage on the
school for six months by giving her leave
of absence."
Director Knox said that it was quite
regular to grant the request, as it had been
done in other cases. Dr. Clinton left the
chair and declared that Mrs. Craven was
entitled to a leave of absence, and the
board had no moral right to refuse it. The
request was granted, Muraock alone
voting no.
The following preamble and resolution
were presented by Director Murdock:
Whereas, The appropriation for the support
of the public schools for the ensuing year is
$140,000 less than was expended for tnat pur
pose during the past year, and it is evident
the schools cannot be maintained for the
entire year at the present rate of expenditures;
and whereas, it devolves upon the board to
thoroughly investigate the situation and to
determine what action shall be taken In tbe
serious emergency; therefore be it
Resolved, That the president be asked to ap
point five members, who, with the Superin
tendent, the president and acting president,
shall constitute a special committee, which
shall report at its earliest convenience, man
ing such recommendations as they think
proper regarding the conduct of the schools.
They shall specially report their conclusions
on Ihe following points:
1. What action cau be taken by the board to
restrict miscellaneous expenditures to the
lowest possible sum consistent with the wants
of the schools and to restrict committees to
purchases or expenditures approved or au
thorized by a majority of the board.
2. To what extent the expenditures for
special teachers can be reduced without se
rious disadvantage to the schools.
3. What consolidation of classes can be ju
diciously made?
4. Is it advisable to increase the number of
pupils in any of the classes?
5. Whether the salaries of janitors may be
reduced without injustice.
6. Whether tbe inevitable deficit, should the
schools be continued for the year, shall be met
by a reduction of the salary schedule or by
withholding a portion of the vacation salary.
7. If by a reductien of salaries, to submit a
schedule that by rigid economy in other di
rections may enable us to continue the schools
for the year within the appropriation.
"1 agree with Director Murdock," said
Director Carew. "This is a very serious
question. If the Supervisors or any per
son outside of this board comments with
out reason on the School Department and
then reduces the appropriation, that is no
reason why the salaries of teachers should
be reduced. lam opposed to touching
teachers' salaries, and believe that this
whole matter should be submitted to a
committee of the whole."
Director Comte moved to refer to a com
mittee of the whole, which was done.
The questions will be considered next
Wednesday night.
On motion the sanitary condition of the
Richmond schoolhouse will be investi
gated by Directors Clinton and Soper, who
will invite a Health Officer to accompany
them.
A resolution that Miss Edith Stafford be
elected a member of the evening substi
tute class was carried, at which Director
Murdock grew angry and resigned his
office.
Instantly there was a motion to lay the
resignation on the table.
"1 do hope, gentlemen, this motion will
not prevail," said Mr. Murdock. "My
vote is of no value in this board, and the
only way I can protest is to resign. Teach
ers and others have been after me all the
time with petitions to admit them to teacb.
I thought I could stand this lor three
months more, but I am tired of the ex
travagant methods of the board."
The Directors promised nqt to sign any
more of these petitions and extended tbe
"glad hand" to Mr. Murdock while laying
his resolution on the table. Then the
meeting adjourned.

NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 2â The situation at
the Stock Exchange today showed very little
change. The volume of business increased some
what, but the movements in the leading shares,
'as has been the case for several days past, were
most erratic At the start prices were fraction
ally higher all round, chiefly because of (he re
ci ipt of higher quotations from London and the
'- nuderate buying orders for foreign account. As
the day advanced the bears displayed more cour
' iff anil resisted the eff ens of their opponents to
â¢ lift prices. St. I'aui was a ' pivotal stock. It
opt-i:< d % per cent higher at 7-% and promptly
. went back to 72, but at tnls figure a sharp contest
developed, and despite free sales for both Ac
counts the stock held stubbornly nail y the
pressure to sell carried It down to 71 ij.
â  Sugar was another stock Mat displayed strength
in tin* early trading, rising & 8 n 1 1 1 1 8 . but in mis
ca-e also. the buyers were slipped up and a de
cline ensued. The continued selling is attributa
ble to the unfavorable condition of the suirar
Â«trade, due partly to the offerings of German sugar
In this market. The closing of the Spreckels re

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lÂ£x.; Oct. 2.-There was weakness
to the cables this morning and wheat was affected
thereby, opening at a decline of 14 <i 1 2 c - but soon
shaking off the depression and advancing a full
cent. , When this recovery was accomplished the
offerings became considerably larger and a re
action to opening figures then took place. Again
there was a raiiy of a sharp character, %c being
recovered. The action was erratic In the extreme,
the tone changing irom strong to weak, and vice
versa, without apparent cause. Northwestern re
ceipts were 1136 can against 722 last Friday and
1240 a year ago. â¢ . 1
Chicago received 251 carsâ ll4 more than ex
pectedâand Inspected 120,600 bushels. About
noon the market became very easy, and inside
quotations were established after that hour, clos
ing Paris and Antwerp cables were hlcher, caus
ing a spasm of strength when posted. Berlin wan
Vi mark lower to % mark higher. Export clear
ances were fair al "84,744 bushels. December
wheat open from 68% cto 69% c, sold between
69 % c and 68f4@68s B e, closing at 69% c, Vie
lower than yesterday. Estimated receipts to
morrow 250 cars.
CORNâ Having exhibited more animation yes
terday than has been noticeable for a long time
previously the market for corn retained a portion
ol thai llf<> to-day. Prices were quite firm, the
s reiuth coming entirely from wheat, i Recetots
were 495 cars, 49 more than expected. With
draw from store amounted to 444.546 bushels.
Liverpool advanced Vi of a penny In response to
yÂ«'ser.la 's bulge here, ihe decline In wheat
caused torn to lose stiengtb, prices receding. Ex
port clearances amounted 10 316,869 bushels.
May corn opened at >U.Vsc, sold be. ween 26^'gc

OATSâ Oats were firm. A fair business, but not
a remarkable or c was transacted. The tone was
derlvtd from the other markets. Receipts were
425 cars and 153,000 bushels were taken from
store. Exports were 20,1t>5 bushels. The tone
became easier later In the session with wheat and
corn. May oats closed unchanged from yester
day. Estimated receipts to-morrow 425 cars.
FLAXâ Firm. Cash ranged from 77@79c; De
cember. 80(577%c; May, B&CSBS3,4C. Receipts
were 103 cars. 1
provisionsâ Nothing unusual transpired to
make interesting the provision market. The run
of hogs wats heavy, and prices at the yards were
weak. Thai appeared to be tbe consideration to- :
day, less attention being paid to the grain mar- i
kets, although tbe ultimate action of wheat cor
res onde.l with that i-f piovistons. Tie cose was
â _'i 2 (gisc lower for port:.' a shade lower for
January lard and 2%c lower for January ribs.
Butter was firm to-day. On account of small

BEAUTIFUL BABES
A Wee Mother's Distress
Speedily Brought to a
Happy End.
Their Father Feared Be : ng Ar

Them All to Starve,
ABLE TO EARN GOOD WAGES.
The Whole Family Is Now in the
Beulah Home and Is Being
Well Cared For.
Oaxlaitp Omc-K San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 2. )
Three beautiful little children, aged one,
three and five years, ana their petite (
mother, all of whom bad been deserted,
were made happy to-day. Just when
hardship and privation seemed about to
overwhelm the plucky little woman she
found a helping hand where she least ex
pected it.
Mrs. Truesdell of Alameda, a young I
wife and mother, told her story to the j
secretary of the Children's Society ana j
asked for aid. It is a very difficult matter j
for Mrs Prescott to find a good home for
a woman with one child and it may fainy
be regarded as an impossibility to find a
place for a mother with three. Mrs.
Prescott applied at all the houses, but
' there were no vacancies ana the little
mother was almost heartbroken.
"But help came from an unexpected
quaner," said Mrs. Frescott to-day. "Mrs.
Carrie Judd Montgomery, the Salvation
ist, who has all Kinds of homes and ref
uges at Beuiah, heard of this case. It did
not take her long to make inquiries, and
when she heard their story her mind was
made up. She at once decided to take all
the three children, but nothing was said
about tbe mother.
"Mrs. Truesdell took her little ones to
the cottage home at Beulah, fully pre
pared to part from them untii her circum
stances changed, was her intention iq
go to work and help to support them, but
Mrs. Montgomery is a mother and when
shs saw the three little ones and their
plucky mother she decided that they
should not be separated.
"Where are you going?" the Salvation
ist asked the mother.
"To look for work and try to support
the children," replied Mrs. Truesdeil.
" 'There is room nere for you all.' said
Mrs. Montgomery, and now Mrs. Trues
dell is employed at the home and is get-

ting a salary fully twice as large as I could
have expected for her. This is not tbe
first time Mrs. Montgomery has acted this
way, but Salvationists are always doing
such things."
The Truesdell case was in the courts
some months ago, and the father prom
ised to do better and support his family.
After beine dismissed from court, on
ninety days' probation, he did very well
and saved a little money. Then he went
on a spree, and, fearing the consquences,
be deserted his family and has not been
heard of for some time.

Narrow Escape of an Engineer
From Death Beneath the
Alameda Lccal.
The Health Officer's Report Shows
tbe Encinal City to Be a
Healthy Place.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 2.â The presence
of mind and prompt action of Conductor j
Buchanan of the broad-gauge local train I
to-day was the means of saving the life of \
S. B. Swan, engineer of the Hayes-street
cable line, San Francisco. As it was
Swan had his clothes badly torn, his
shoes ripped, and was nearly dead from
fright.
Mr. Bwan had been visiting here and
attempted to catch the 1 o'clock train for
home. The train started before he reached
the depot, so he started down Park street .
on a run and caught tbe handle rails of j
tbe middle car as it crossed the street,
and was thrown off his feet. He clung to
the rail and was dragged along with his
feet nearly under the wheels.
The attention of Conductor Buchanan
was attracted to the unfortunaie man by
the cries of the school children. He
promptly pulled the signal cord and
grabbed tbe man by the coat-coilar just I
as his hold on the railing failed. He held
him until the train stopped, when Mr.
Swan was taken aboard, exhausted with
fright. He is a man of 2CO pounds and
seemed grateful for tbe timely aid of the
conductor, whom he thanked profusely.

MORE GOLD BRICKS.
A Small Incident That Shows the Great
Interest in the Cam- , .
paign. .
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 2.â There was a
clash between commerce and politics last
night, and early this morning and to-day
tbe billboards all over town are decorated
with silver and gold as they were never
before.
During yesterday a billposter was busy
on a little sign that was printed in gold
and consisted solely of the two words
"gold brick." When Oakland awoke early
this morning "gold brick" was all over
town. Two or three energetic Populists
or Democrats, or both, saw them and at
once concluded that it was a device o the
enemy of their 50-cent dollar campaign
and at one- started out to obliterate the
offensive gold signs. By noon l&ree pla
cards printed in silver and representing a
dollar were posted over the gold signs.
The off n ding 'Void brick" man is a
man named Buss of East Oakland.
He thought he had a fortune in sight in
some small article that he manufactures
jinu tiaa spent bis small savings in gold
signs which angered the Populists. To add
to his discomfiture Buss is also a Populist.
Some Odd Facts.

resided when be registered. If this be not
attended (o a vote will be lost. Up to the
present time it is believed nearly 400
changes have been made. The work of
securing a list of electors who have died
since they registered is now going on, so
that the names can be so checked when
the great register is published. It is esti
mated that there are fully 350 of these.
Most of these are past 60, the oldest being
Anelus Giovanni, 104 years of age.
Denies Her Charges .
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 2â Dr. J. Rad
ford Fearn, whose wife, Lillian L. Fearn,
is suing him for a divorce in Los Angeles,
has returned from Tulare and is at his
father's residence in this city. He enters
a general denial of all tlie charges, saying
they will be proven false when the case
comes to trial.
On the other hand his friends claim that
she really deserted him. She had con
tracted a number of bills and preceded
him to Tulare, but instead of stopping she
went on to her motner in Los Angeles,
where she acquired a residence ana began
the suit.

JUDGE SEAWELL.
BLOWN OUT OF HIS BED
Many Accidents at Fruitvale
Caused by Blasting Tree
Stumps.
Windows Shattered, Roofs Broken and
Electric Wires Parted by the
Flying Rcots.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,*
908 Broadway, Oot. 2. \
The men at work on the Wetherbee
place removing stumps of large trees
startled the community this morning by
an explosion of giant powder that shattered
glass in a dozen adjacent houses, broke
roofs and parted electric wires.
Tom West, an experienced man in the
handling of explosives, was in charge, ana
placed seven sticks of No. 2 giant powder
under a big stump, arranged to go off one
after the other, as he had done for weeks
before. But his well-prepared plans failed,
and three of the sticks went off at once.
He and his assistant were standing only
forty feet from the "lump and were un
harmed, as was the Wetherbee house in
the lot, but the neighbors were startled by
cracking glass in every direciion. Only
half of the stump came out, but part of
that took a soutbwesterlv course, cutting
the span-wires of the Hay wards electric
road and breaking the glass in a car stand
ing about 300 feet from the scene. The
first piece landed 600 feet from the starting
point in a vacant lot. The other piece
went about 500 feet east, and stopped just
short of striking a cottage.
A drugstore, butcher shop and grocery
each had two windows broken, besides
two holes punctured in the grocery roof.
The residence of Mr. Farnum had four
large window-panes broken, and Mr.
Aid rich had a large window nearly ten
feet square shattered.
Mr. Cordes was thrown out of his bed
600 feet away from the scene and was de
posited on the floor amid a shower of
broken glass.
The work was being done by E. B.
Stone, who visited th*> damaged houses
as soon as he learned of the accident,
and gave orders to have all repairs made
at his expense. He said he was glad no
lives were lost.
ESCAPE OF THE
SOLID SEVEN
Jury Finds a Verdict yinv in
Favor of the Accused
Supervisors.
Court Rules That the Board of
Equalization Acts in a Judi
cial Capacity.
THE IXCLUDED EVIDENCE.
Judge S?awell's Ruling May Result
in a Dismissal of the Pro
ceedings.
The seven Supervisors who were ac
cused by tLe late Grand Jury of corruption
in lowering the assessments of the Spring
Valley Water Works, the Market-street
Railway Company and the San Francisco
Gaslight Company have escaped. The ob
jections raised by Counsel J. C. Campbell,
Patrick Reddy and J. H. Dickinson
against the introduction of testimony
tending to show that the valuation of the
franchises runs too low were sustained by
Judge Seawell in Department 1 of the Su
perior Court yesterday.
The court held in view Judge Wallace's
ruling in the Siebe case that tbe act of tbe
Board of Equalization in fixing the assess
ment was tbe exercise of a purely judicial
function and, therefore, could not be at
tacked by evidence showing that in the
opinion of others the judgment of the
board was incorrect.
"Does your Honor mean that we must
actually prove corruption?" asked Mr.
Hosmer for tbe prosecution.
The court replied : "I do not believe that
the mere judgment of an officer exercising
judicial functions, no matter how errone
ous, is evidence of corruption."
District Attorney Barnes, who was in
court yesterday, saw at once, and so did
his assistant, Mr. Hosmer, that the taste
of proving corruption by direct testimony
was a greater burden than the prosecution
could sustain.
The Grand Jury, while actually con
vinced that the seven Supervisors were in
league with the benefited corporations,
failed at the time the case was considered
to find a witness to swear positively that
any Supervisor had been corruptly ap
proached. The weakness of the case was
understood in the District Attorney's
â¢office, where tbe accusation was filed, but
there was hope that a course of judicial
inquiry would be permitted in behalf of
the people which would reveal the true
motive for reducing corporate franchises
to a figure far below that returned by the
Assessor. â¢
The ruling of Judge Seawell practically
amounted to a dismissal of the case. A
few questions were propounded to Mr.
Farquaharson, a clerk in the office of the
Board of Supervisors, and then the Dis
trict Attorney rested-
J. C. Campbell, addressing the court,
said : "We move that your Honor instruct
tbe jury to find a verdict for defendants."
The court to tbe juryâ "lf you find in
favor of the defendants you will find the
defendants not guilty on each count."
The foreman of the jury responded:
"We find t i.e defendants not guilty on
each count."
The court then discharged the jury.
During the trial on the case the Civic
Federation was not in evidence. Among
the members of the Grand Jury Theodore
F. Payne was the only one in court.
Horace p. Dunn, the expert, was present
and noted the pzoceedings. The accused
Supervisors were represented by lawyers
who were active in the cause of the de
fendants.
The Supervisors were not compelled
under oath to explain why they rated
Sprinjj Valley property worth 120,000,000
in February, when the company was to
receive revenue on its investment from the
taxpayers, and in March, when the com
pany's investment was to be taxed for the
benefit of the City, it was worth less than
half that sum. According to the law
transactions of this character are errors ot
judgment committed by the Supervisors
in a judicial capacity.
The verdict rendered by instruction does
not obscure the fact that the seven ac
cused Supervisors reduced the assessments
on the franchises of rich corporations and
thereby compelled home-owners and mer
chants to bear an unequal burden of taxa
tion. It may console the plundered tax
payers, however, to know that they have
been robbed in a judicial capacity.

READY FOR THEIR GAME
Berkeley Football Men Will
Meet tbe Reliance Team
To-Day.
Coach Butterwcrth Receives a Great
Ovation Upon Coming to the
Field.
BEEKELEY, Cal.. Oct. 2.-When But
terworth came down to the football field
this afternoon to give the players their
first lesson this terra a round oi cheers
and college yells such as has probably
never been heard before went up from the
throats of 800 students and visitors, who
surrounded tbe field and covered the
bleachers. This particularly enthusiastic
demonstration on the part of the students
was doubtless dne to their previous
acquaintance with tbe great fullback and
because be is the first man who has ever
been engaged to coach Berkeley's team a
second year.
After a hearty handshaking with his
last year's acquaintances on the gridiron
Butterworth set the men to work, and
half an hour was spent in neavy line
work. The play was rapid and snappy
from the very outset. Captain Ransome
took the ball on several occasions and
made a number of deep plunges through
the line. Birdsall, the new center, made
some remarkable openings in the line for
the halves, and Hopper did distinguishing
work in bringing down runners from his
position at right end. Decidedly more
vigor and energy was put into the plays
than has characterized any previous work
this season.
The men seem to be in fairly pood con
dition for their initial game of the season
with the Reliance Club at Central Park
to-morrow afternoon. The team, taken
as a whole, will be rather light, on ac
count of the slight injuries which some of
the first eleven men have recently re
ceived.
Following will be the make-up of the
Berkeley team: Right end, Hopper;
right tackle, Hynes; right guard, Greis
berg; center, Birdsall; left guard, Lud
low; left tackle, Castlehun; left end,
Craig; left half, Hall; left end, Sherman;
quarter, Kennedy; fullbacK, Ransome.
Ransome, Sherman and Kennedy are
the only three men on the team who were
on the Varsity eleven last year. Selfridge
and Hutch inson of last year's team are
both in college, but the former cannot
play because of objections made on the
part of his family, and Hutchinson is dis
qualified because of a strained ankle.
>ew Law in Effect.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 2.â The new
license ordinance of Berkeley is now in
effect and on Monday Marshal Lloyd will
proceed to arrest all violators thereof.
Several outside firms which send delivery
wagons into Berkeley have already paid
the new license fee and others are pre
paring to open branch stores in the town.
Rumors are current that efforts will be
made to fight the new law in the courts,
but it is not thought that any one will at
tempt to do so, as the ordinance does not
differ materially from the laws enforced
by the city of Oakland.
Mar Debate This Term.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 2.â Efforts are
being made to have the debate between
Berkeley and Stanford for tbe Carnot
medal take place during the present term,
instead of during the spring term, as has
been the custom. It is thought that a
much highe4 standard of excellence In col
lege oratory would be developed if inter
collegiate debating were a feature of both
terms of the academic year.
Brief Sews Items.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 2.â The Quill, pub
lished ai the State University of lowa, has
printed an editorial on tbe recent backstop
rush at Berkeley, in which the riÃht of co-eds
to take pan in rushes is defended.
Tbe Athletic Association of the university
has placed a large list, framed, of all students
in college on tbe bulletin board of North Hall,
the names oi those who have paid their
atnletic dues being marked. It is thought
that this will nave the effect of bringing delin
quents to time.
A small fire destroyed the hedge in front of
David Neely's property today, at the corner
of University avenue and Cedar street.
The horse of William Strieker ran away last
night, being frightened by the Salvation Army
drum oa Shattuok avenue. The runaway was
stopped by George Horritan after a collision

THE OLD STORY.
A Domestic Blows Out the Gaa and
Nearly Kills Herself.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 2.â The old story

AND STILL HIS
GAS BILL GREW
B. F. Wellington Says He
Was Charged Without
Reason.
Not Satisfied With the Meter
the Company Aver
aged.
FIGURES CAUSE CONFUSION.
A Dissatisfied Consumer Sees in the
Gas Company's Methods an Argu
ment for Ci;y Ownership.
Are San Francisco consumers of gas be
ing systematically and arbitrarily over
charged? B. F. Wellington, seed mcr
cnaut at 425 Washington street, declares it
his belief that they are, and he displays
an array of documentary evidence which
seems to lend color to his declaration. Mr.
Wellington has been in controversy with
the San Francisco Gas Light Company for
a month, and the result of his experience
has been to convince him that it is a mat
ter of small moment that figures won't lie
so long as gas companies figure.
Mr. Wellington's grievance against the
local corporation dates back to about the
Ist of September, when he received a bill
for two months' expenditure of gas at his
residence, 712 Franklin street. Ordinarily,
perhaps, Mr. Wellington would have al
lowed the bill to pass unchallenged, but in
this instance the face of the statement
was covered with a confusing labyrinth of
figures and the merchant's curiosity was
aroused. Moreover, the bill was tor an
amount far in excess of hiÂ» usual biils for
light, ana ne determined to ascertain the
cause thereof, if possible.
A peculiarity of this bill over previous
ones was that it was made out for two
months, a ruse, Mr. Wellington believes,
to cover up the arbitrary action which he
discovered upon the face of the bill.
From June 26 to August 17 a total con
sumption of 1800 feet was shown upon the
bill. Of this oniy 200 feet was burned from
June 16 to July 20. Marginal notes were
on the bill, showing that on the latter date
the meter in Mr. Wellington's residence
was found to register 35 per cent slow, and
it was accordingly removed. There wa3
evidently nothing slow about the meter
which was substituted, for from July 20 to
August 17 it "showed a registration "of 1600
feet. The total thus arrived at was 1800
feet for the entire neriod. To this much
of the bill Mr. Wellington found no fault.
He was further prepared to accept the
company's own statement of the first
meter's deficiency, and allow an addition
of 35 percent on the biil for the period dur
ing which the meler was that much be
hind standard.
The gas company had other ideas as to
tne proper metnocl of arrivine at the
amount of gas whicii would pass through
a meter 35 per cent slow. They accord
ingly took the register of the new meter,
and ascertaining from that the amount of
gas the Wellingtons ought to use in a
month, added 1600 feet to the bill for the
period. The former meter showed
200 feet. As corrected, Wellington was
charged for 1800 feet for that period.
When Mr. Wellington comprehended
the system by which his bill had been in
flated he waxed exceedingly wroth.
Thirty-five per cent of 200 feet, he fig
ured, wouid be 70 feet, and this he con
ceived to be the amount which should
jave been added to his bill, a difference in
estimates of 1730 feet. The system of
averaging the first month by the second,
he declares, would have been unfair
enough under any circumstances, as his
bill for the month preceding those in dis
pute shows a consumption of only 600
feet, but during the entire period ior
which the arbitrary addition was made
his family was out of town. It was while
he tfas occupying the premises alone, he
claims, that he was charged lor iust three
times the amount of illumination his en
tire family required the preceding month.
"I used scarcely any gas during that
month," he says. "I was home very lit
tleand had occasion to use the gas only
to light me to bed. I considered that if
the gas company could thus without show
of right or reason charge me for that
which 1 had not consumed they couidand
probably did do so with others, and it was
a matter involving thousands of dollars
annually to consumers. I determined not
to submit to it and accordingly made a
protest."
Mr. Wellington's protest was not very
fruitful. The company refused to ac
knowledge the injustice of their course,
but to save trouble agreed to deduct 1000
feet from the bill. This did not satisfy
Wellington. He maintained that the
Only just guide to the amount of fuel con
sumed was the meter, subject to correc
tion as shown by their own test.
The company refused to accept this view
and he went away dissatisfied. Some lit
tle correspondence ensued between the
parties, ending in an ultimatum on the
part of the company to the effect that
they would throw off the entire bill if
Wellington would pay |10he had owed on
a gas grate since 1892. A copy of this let
ter WBB exhibited by Charles L. Barrett,
cashier of the company, as an evidence of
the corporation's desire to act fairly.
Th^ effect of this document, however,
is apparently offset by a receipted bill for
the grate in question which Wellington
possesses. An item of this bill is *'By de
dr.ciion, as per aereement, $10." This,
Wellington says, is the result oi the grate
having lailsd to meet the conditions of its
Bale.
"I have been unable to reach an under
standing with this company," Mr. Wel
hneton said, "and since diacoverine this
overcharge I have talked with other peo
ple who have had similar difficulties.
This matter 1 consider of grave import
ance to gas consumers and a most potent
argument in favor of municipal owner-
Bhip of gas works. Hereafter I intend to
watch my meter more closely. I would
advise other consumers to do likewise."
Mr. Barrett of the gas company says
the fact that the meter registering 35 per
cent slow does not necessarily show that
that is all its shortcomings. He rather
considers it a sign that the met r is out
of order and might not have registered at
all. He contends that the average system
used in Wellington's case was a perfectly
fair one.
Three Secret Indictments.
The United States Grand Jury held a short
tession yesterday afternoon, returning three
indictments, which were ordered placed on
tbe secret file. Two were small postal cases*
ut the third, Lincoln Brodt, is regarded in
Federal circles as a case of great importance.
{Some weeks ago Brodt entered at the Marys
riiie L>Aua Office 320 acres of what he claimed
was Umber land. The tract in question is
near Magaiia, Butte County. It seems that
Merry and Parry own several mines within
the alleged timber lands, one of which, the
Mki mine, has been in operation for more
than nine years. When these gentlemen
â¢earned of Brodt's action they reported the
matter to the Federal authorities here, and a
[parching investigation was at once instituted.
Several witnesses from Butte County were ex
imined. their evidence showing that the lnnd
intered by Brodt was mineral and not timber
Inna. There are said to be six counts against
Brodt, the most serious being a charge of per
lury. Bail was fixed at $5000, though Brodt
las not yet been arrested.

WESTWARD THE
STAR OF CLUBDOM
Pacific-Union Accepts a
Fine Site on Van Ness
Avenue.
Members by a Decisive Vote Re
ject the Calvary Church
Tender.
A LADIES' ANNEX IN VIEW.
First Ten MembÂ°rs Called on Sub
scribed for $200,000 of the
Bonds to Be Sold.
The members of the Pacific-Union Club
decided in effect last evening to accept one
of the proposed sites for the new club
house on Van Ness avenue.
The meeting which was held last night
was the longest and most spirited in the
history of the organization. The session
lasted from 8 until 10 o'clock. There was
a free interchange of views on the subject
of so much importance to the club. Many
of the so-called conservative members,
who were at first inclined to "view with
alarm" every proposition involving a de
parture from time-honored customs of the
club, joined the representatives of the
progressive column and pronounced in
favor of a new edince worthy of the insti
tution and for the club's exclusive use.
The active promoters of the moving en
terprise, E. W. Hopkins, president of the
club, and George A. Newhall, submitted
various tenders of locations, embracing
five sites on Van Ness avenue, together
with others nearer the business center of
the City.
The proposition to bny the Calvary
Church site, the property on the north
west corner of Powell and Green streets,
was submitted and some discussion there
on ensued. The remarks were attentively
considered by 150 members present and
the result of the vote was a decisive rejec
tion of the offer. This site can be had for
$240,000, but its proximity to the new mar
ket on Powell street renders it undesirable
for club uses.
The sentiment expressed was so largely
in favor of going as far west as Van Ness
avenue and securing ample grounds, that
the committee was authorized to make a
selection of one of the five sites offered on
that avenue. The committee is not to go
further south on Van Ness avenue than
Sutler street, but may have a range of
choice extending three blocks north.
When the committee secures an accept
able site a report of its action will be sub
mitted to the members of the club for
final ratification.
The most significant event of the ses
sion last night was the almost unanimous
yote by which the members resolved in
favor of a ladies' annex. Since the spirit
to fall in line with modern customs has
entered the club the members have appar
ently resolved to accept the most ad
vanced notions of up-to-date clubdom.
Tuere was apprehension among some of
the younger members that the conserv
atives would resist the '"annex" innova
tion, but instead of resistance ieady con
currence was shown.
Many of the members of the Pacific-
Union seemed to fancy the Van Ness site
known as the Fred Castle property, but
which is now owned by Colonel C. F.
Crocker. Other sites presenting many
advantages will be considered. It can be
regarded as settled that the club will
move. The lease of the premises now oc
cupied expires next Apul, but there is an
option of extension for ten. years. To
complete such a mansion as the Pacific-
Unions will probably construct may re
quire nearly two years' time.
Money to put forward the scheme of
improvements will be forthcoming on de
mand. Ten members of the club who
were asked to take bonds have already
signified a willingness to subscribe $200,
--000.
The idea of a social club, with ail the
exclusiveness implied, has been fully
accepted by the membership. It is con
templated that the grounds shall be
ample, the building worthy of the club
and highly creditable to San Francisco.
In great cities nowadays there are two
classes of clubs â one of the social and ex
clusive institutions and the other of down
town business clubs. The Pacific-Union
at present has a leaven of both classes,
but when it goes to Van Ness avenue it
will take rank at once as the leading
social club on this site of the continent.
NOT A "FLIMFLAMMER.
Bryant Fanning Denies That He Re
ceived Money Under False Pretenses.
The case of Bryant Fanning of San Jose,
who was charged by Frank McManus
with obtaining money under false pre
tenses, came up for hearing before Judge
Conlan yesterday ana was continued for
bearing until next Saturday.
According to McManus Fanning bor
rowed $5 from him on the representation
that he was about to purchase Mc-
Manus' saloon at 16 Third street. Fan
ning, who has until recently been em
ployed as foreman of the San Jose Her
ald, indignantly denies the charge. He
says that he was engaged in negotiations
with McManus for the purchase of his
place, but before the papers were signed
he received information that caused him
to decide not to purchase. He accordingly
notified McManus in writing. He denies
that he ever received or asked for $5 from
McManus, and is at a loss to know upon
what the charge is based.
Assaulted a Chinaman.
Daniel McAvoy, a youngster living on Val
lejo street, was taken to the Receiving Hospital
yesterday for treatment for a broken arm and
a badly contused face. He was on a peddler's
wagon on Broadway and Dupont street, and In
a spirit of mischief hurled a bunch 01" grapes
at a Chinaman who was standing in the door

IN OHIO AND OREGON.
How the Campaign is Waged at Port
land and in ->U- Kin ley's State.
James Parker, an old resident of Cleve
land, Ohio, is at t c Grand. He has been
on a visit to the Yellowstone and is on hi?
way to Los Angeles to spend the winter
with his son, who is a physician. Mr.
Parker says everything political is one
way in Ohio and many other States, and
that is for McKinley.
"Democrats and all are for him," said
Mr. Parker. "They are saying they have
seen this thing go about far enough, and
so they are out for McKinley, protection
and good government. McKinley will
carry Ohio by at least 100,000. He is a
good safe man, and they all know it.
"It seems to me outside of Ohio politics
is being waged better in Oregon than
most any other Btate I noticed. In Port
land the men are out on the streets and
in the parks, organizing in the most earn
est way. You hear the names of Bryan
and McKinley from everybody you meet,
and each has its warmest kind of advo
cates. It is a veritable battle there. I
have never seen greater interest than was
manifested in Portland."
McNEILL'S SENTENCE.
Judge Wallace .Sends Him to State
Prison for Five Years.
Charles McNeill was yesterday sen
tenced to five years in the State prison
for assault with a deadly weapon on tne
person of Frank Rankin.
McNeill is the painter who some time
ago, while working at his trade at the
house. of K. P. Merillion, imagined that
Mrs. Merillion had become enamored of
him. He made life a. burden to the
Merillions until the husband took a shot
at him. which failed to take effect.
He was convicted of the attempt to take
Rankin's life by a jury in Judge Wallace's
court, and his Honor in sentencing him
remarked that although McNeill came of
a good family he seem* to be naturally of
the criminal class, and as he had a prior
convinction against him he was put out
of the way of doing harm for the next hve
years. _______^__
IDA VALERGA GOES EAST,
The Local Prima Donna Has Re
ceived an Offer From
Mapleson.
It Is the Colonel's Wish to Secure
Her for His Imperial Opera
Company.
Miss Ida Valerga, who to-night closes
her engagement at the Tivoli, has just
received an offer from Colonel Mapleson
to become one of the leading prima donnas
in his new Imperial Opera Company,
which opens an extended American sea
son at the Academy of Music, New York,
this month. Miss Valerga has not yet de
cided whether she will sign a contract
with the veteran impressario, buc in all
probability she will. la any case it is her
intention to leave for the East next month.
There are few local singers better known
than Miss Ida Valerga, and she is an espe
cial favorite with the members of the
Italian colony. She began her musical
studies in this City under Signor Bianchi
and continued them with Professor Spa
dina. Later she went to Milan and took
lessons from the celebrated maestro, San
Giovanni, Her debut, which proved a

brilliant success, was made in Milan.
After singing for some time in Italy she
returnen home to California and made an
engagement in this City with Francesco
Rosa for an extended season of opera in
Mexico.
From Mexico Miss Valerga went to the
Eastern States of the Union with the
Strakosch Opera Company, and later on
she appeared under Mapleson's and Ab
bey's management, singing in company
with Patti, Gerster, Nilsson and Abbott.
While in this distinguished association
the prima donna appeared at her Ma
jesty's Theater before Queen Victoria.
In 1889 Miss Vaierga returned to Cali
fornia, when she shortly afterward made
an engagement to sing for the late Wil
liam Kreling in grand opera at the
Tivoli. Since then she has resided in this
City, appearing only in concert and from
time to time in special performances of
grand opera at the Tivoli. She closes a
successful engagement of "Aida" at the
Tivoli to-night. Her many friends will
hear with surprise of her intended de
parture for the East.
JAMES GRAHAM DEAD.
The Well-Known Manufacturer Pauses
Away at -Newark.
James Graham, a prominent business
man and manufacturer, died at his home
in Newark, last evening. He had been
sick only one week. The cause of death
was pneumonia. He leaves a widow and
six children, George, William, Clarence,
Etta, Stella, Florence and Jessie.
Mr. Graham was known as the pioneer
stove manufacturer of the Pacific Coast,
being the first to establish a stove-factory
in California that could compete on even
terms with the manufacturers in the East
ern States. He came to California twenty
years ago from Kincardine, Ont., of which
place he was a native. He elected Newark
as the sue of his manufacturing plant.
The Dusiness grew and during several
years a salesroom has been maintained in
this City. Mr. Graham was a public
spirited citizen and was very kind to the
poor, performing unostentatiously many
acts of charity. He was a leading mem
ber of the Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association.
In .Judge Wallace's Court-..
Judge Wallace yesterday sentenced L.
Rodericks, Phillipi Carataza and Joseph
Baker, who were charged with robbery but

taining money under false pretenses and who
yesterday failed to appear when called, was
declared forfeited and a bench warrant issued.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 3, 1896.
THE EXAMINER
AND THE SHERIFF
How an Attempt Was
Made to Coerce Mr.
Whelan.
The Morning Paper Wanted
Positioos and Fat Adver
tising Contracts.
ITS BLUFFS DID NOT WOKK.
"Roasts" That Had an Effect
Opposite to the One
Intended.
The very questionable methods of the
Examiner in dealing with the heads of
municipal departments were never better
illustrated than in its treatment of Sheriff
Whelan. Ever since that official took his
office he has been the object of malicious
attacks from the Examiner.
This has been the subject of much com
ment at the City Hall, particularly as Mr.
Whelan is a Democrat and supposed to
belong to the same party and to be domi
nated by the same principles as the editor
of the Examiner.
The reason of this persistent and sys
tematic badgering of a public official came
to light a few days ago and many were the
expressions of contempt showered on the
paper tnat would take advantage of its
power to injure a public official simply be
cause he would not do its bidding.
When Sheriff Whelan had taken the
reins of government in his department he
was approached by an employe of the
Examiner, who wanted to know what he
was going to do about the advertising of
the office, which amounts to a large sum
every month.
"I have not figured on that," answered
the Sheriff.
"But you are going to give it to the Ex
aminer, are you not?" asked the Examiner
man.
"Not if I know it," said the astonished
Sheriff.
"But the Examiner is a Democratic pa
per, and entitled to the patronage of your
office," said the agent.
The Sheriff was mystified, but said he
guessed not.
"We are entitled to it, and we want it,"
said the man.
"Now, young man, I want to tell you
one thing, and you can go back and tell
your employers what 1 say," said the
thoroughly exasperated Sheriff.
"I owe my election to no paper, much
less to the Examiner. It did not support
me, and it shall get no more of the patron
age than any other paper."
The agent tried to argue, but the Sheriff
was firm, and, moreover, did exactly as
he had promised to do.
The Examiner was not satisfied with a
fair share of the spoils, however, and im
mediately began to annoy the Sheriff.
He was not surprised, therefore, when
another agent of the Examiner called on
him and asked that Real Estate Deputy
Adams be retained in his position.
As a man who had materially assisted
the Sheriff in making his fight had been
promised the job the request was of
course refused, and then the "roasts"
were redoubled.
This deliberate attempt to coerce him
into doing its bidding only made the
Sheriff more determined not to give in
ana he gave the Examiner, if anything,
the smaller end of the patronage. Since
then other efforts have been made to in
fluence the Sheriff to "stand in with" his
annoyers by particularly malicious at
tacks, followed by renewed requests for
more advertising, but nothing has come
to the Examiner in consequence except a
more unsavory reputation.
PRISON GRANITE BARRED
Manufacturers Jubilant Over
the Success of the
Fair.
California Redwood for New Agnews
Buildingâ The Tennessee
Marble.
The Manufacturers and Producers' As
sociat on met yesterday afternoon in the
Mills building and discussed matters in
relation to the fair which that body is
holding here in connection with the Me
chanics' Institute. There were present
President Julian Sonntag, Secretary Mead
and Messrs. Currier, Sbarboro, Keller,
Kerr and McLaughlin.
President Sonntag stated that the man
agement of the Mechanics' Fair could
congratulate themselves that the present
exhibition was in every way the most suc
cessful that had ever been held in this
City. Upward of 70,000 square feet of
space had been occupied by exhibitors
and a far better class of articles had been
shown the public, and these superior ex
hibits were home produced in every in
stance. It was indeed a home exposition.
The 25- cent single admission charge had
been met by the patrons of the fair in a
splendid manner and three times as many
people had visited the exhibition than in
former years, consequently at a rough
estimate about 25 per cent was the increase
from the 50 per cent reduction. This
establishes the 25-cent rate for all time.
However, the expenses had been in
creased about $5000. More and costlier
premiums had been given, which was in a
measure due to the fact that a better
quality of articles was exhibited. The
handsome fish exhibit, which has attract
ed so many sightseers to the southern
side of the Pavilion, cost $3000, as the fish
had to be brought from distant parts of
the country and the young spawn from
the State Commission hatcheries at con
siderable expense.
It is the intention of the association to
procure space for an exhibition at the Los
An eles Home Produce Exposition to be
held next January, and $3000 was sub
scribed for that purpose.
On motion Messrs. Kerr, Currier and
McLaughiin were appointed a committee
to inquire into the matter of using con
vict-labor stone for the Affiliated Colleges
buildings. It is the desire of the associa
tion that none of the Foisom granite
dressed by the prisoners at that penal in
stitution be used in competition with free
labor. The committee will also examine
the Tennessee marble, which the State
Harbor Commissioners intend to use on
the new ferry building. The superi r
quality of the stone, with its hiÂ«h polish,
recommends it to the consideration of the
association.
The question of substituting California
redwood for Oregon pine in the building
to be erected at the Aunews Insane Asy
lum was considered. When a home pro
duction can be used with profit the asso
ciation can see no reason why it may not
be done. The matter was referred to Mr.
Tacy.
A motion was adopted that all the ncr
cantile bodies in the State be requested to
send delegates to a conference to be held
in this City at which the subject of pro
moting California industry will be con
sidered. It is believed that such a confer
ence of men interested in home manufac
ture will greatly stimulate those industries.
Messrs. Kerr, Keller and Mead were ap
pointed a committee to communicate with
Boards of Trade, Chambers of Commerce
and other interested bodies for this object.
A ma3s-meeting will be held soon at
Metropolitan Temple by the Manufactur
ers and Producers' Association for the
purpose of promoting the proposed con
ference.
BURGLARS' CARNIVAL.
They Brea'r Into a House, I.ock the
Doors and Clean Out the Place.
When Mrs. E. Schneider and her daugh
ter of 604 Oak street returned home last
evening about 8 o'clock they found the
door of their own residence securely
fastened against t em. A locksmith was
found, who succeeded in getting into the
house, and it was then learned that
burglars held high carnival there. All of
the rooms had been ransacked and the
thieves had tossed articles of dress and
furniture in every direction. They had
entered by a kitchen window and had
broken the locks of several doors which
they had found fastened. About $150
worth of jewelry and $50 in coin were taken.
They left no clew to their identity.

AWAITING A CHANGE.
B. W. Woodbury of Colorado on the
Condition of things in His State.
Colonel R. W. Wood bury, who was for
many years editor and owner of the Den
ver Times, and afterward presiaent and
a leading owner of one of the largest
banks in Denver, is in the City. Colonel
Woodbury is one of the pioneers of Colo
rado, and has contributed very largely to
the upbuilding of the State. For a long
time, while rated as a millionaire, he
backed many important enterprises, and
his services has been of great value to
countless numbers of people.
The gentleman is in California on a
business and pleasure trip. He has been
interestod for two or three years in the
Blake Railroad from the vicinity of The
Needles to the Vanderbilt mining district.
He spent last winter in Los Angeles, and
has since been at his old home in Colo
rado.
"It is still pretty quiet in my State," he
said last night, "but we are hoping it will
be better after the National election. We
have no doubt it will be so there, if the
result should ba in favor of silver."
Colonel Woodbury says he thinks it
doubtful if Senator Teller will visit Csli
lornia, as in a recent conversation with
him the Senator said he expected only to
speak in the doubtful States of the middle
West. Colonel Woodbury will be here
several days.
Trouble Over Twenty Dollars.
Charles W. Grim, a brass finisner, was
arrested for petty embezzlement yester
day. It seems that C. T. Berry wanted to open
a saloon in one of the resident jterts of the City,
and asked Grim to assist in getting on his peti
tion the necessary signatures of residents.
Grim said that be did not have the time to
spare, but tnat if Berry would put up a litt c
money several of his (Grim's) friends would do
what they could in that direction. Berry
cave him $20, which the latter on the spot
divided among several who proffered their
services. Berry failed to secure the necessary
signatures, either directly or indirectly, and
he demanded of Grim the return of the money.
Failing to get it he swore out a warrant for
Grim's arrest.
Whnt Town Talk Offers.
An interesting and well-edited table of con
tents is offered to th e readers of Town Talk
this week. The literary matter is interspersed
with excellent half-tone illustrations and the
entire appearance of the publication is a tri
umph of the printers' art. The new charter
and the local campaign are among the sub
jects treated with the fearlessness and candor
that characterize Town Talk's editorial policy.
Crisp stories, good poetry, political news and
brisk comment on the doings of well-known
people in the community are some of the en
tertaining features of this bright journal.
Town Talk is thoroughly up to date. *
Suspended for Fifteen Days.
David Linden, the engineer of the tug Ethel
and Mary, was suspended for fifteen days by
Supervising Inspector Bermineham yesterday.
Linden, it will be remembered, attached the
tire hose to the pump and then went ashore
for the night, with the result that the tug
filled and went to the bottom. Captain R. E.
Barron was also suspended for fifteen days for
violating tne limits of his license. It appears
that Captain Barron is only privileged to
navigate the waters of San Francisco Bay, but
some days ago he violated this by taking a
ateamer into San Pablo Bay.
SIR WILLIAM LANE
BOOKER ARRIVES
Return to the Coast of a
Well-Known English
Diplomat.
Formerly British Consul for
Calilornia, Oregon and
Washington.
WATCHED THE CLAN-NA-GAEL.
Knighted for Distinguished Service
While Consul-General at
New York.
Sir William Lane Booker, K. C. M. Q.
(which means Knight Commander of the
order of St. Michael and St. George) has
returned to San Francisco after an absence
of several years and is now sojourning
with his wife at the Hotel Richelieu, on
Van Ness avenue.
Sir William was British Consul at San
Francisco for several years prioi to 1883,
when, for efficient work in her Majesty's
service, he was promoted to the rank of
Consul - General and stationed at New
York, where he has been ever since.
In 1894, having reached the limit of
service that entitled him to retirement, he
took advantage of the English law on the
matter and left active service on a pension
of Â£100 per month, going at once to Eng
land to confer with the Home Government
on important matters.
Sir William Lane Booker is considered
one of tne most astute and accomplished
diplomats to which British interests in
America have been intrusted and he has
repeatedly been honored for the able
manner in which he has upheld the re
sponsibilities of his position.
Not long after being promoted to
the Consul-Generalship at New York, he
began to observe closely the Pinkerton
detective system and soon decided that a
like system could be advantageously used
in England. Many of the suggestions he
made to his Government were adopted,
and it was at his instance that the Pinker
' tons were employed to watch the mem
bers of the Clan-na-G-ael and other Irish
secret societies.
His return to America just about the
time Tynan, the notorious No. 1, was ar
rested in France, was considered signifi
cant of his work in that line.
Having spent the last forty-five years on
United States soil, Sir William is thor
oughly acquainted with America, and is
still further identified with the country
through having chosen two wives from
among American women. The fame oi
California gold fields brought him to
America in 1849, he having arrived in this
City in June of that year, after a tedious
journey of nearly six months from Lon
don.
A year spent in the mines on the Yuba
River and on Butte Creek brought the
young Englishman, then plain William
Lane Booker, little wealth, and he r -
turned to San Francisco, where he was
lor a year tne agent of English insurance
companies. On the formation of the
British consulate in 1851 he became its
secretary and in 1856 was appointed Act
ing Consul. In May of the next year
Consul George Aiken was retired and
B oker became Cousui. Under his en
couragement and fostering care British
interests oa the Pacific Coast prospered.
It was in recognition of his services uere
that Lord Granviiie, on the retirement of
Sir Edward Mortimer Archibal . as Consul-
General at New York, appointed him to
the vacancy. The compliment was a
marked one, as the position is one of the
best in the gift of the British Foreign Of
fice, paying $18,500 per year and having
jurisdiction over New York, New Jersey,
Delaware, Rhode Island, Connecticut,
Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Dakota, Utah
and Wyoming.
Iv 1881, in this City, he married Miss
Elizabeth Page, a daughter of the late
Gilbert Page of Morristown, N. J., who
was then sojourning in Sun Francisco.
Several years aiier the death of this lady
he married Mrs. P. Bispham, the widow
of a retired New York merchant. The or
der of St. Michael and St. George was
conferred on him in 1886, and in 1894 he
was knighted for distinguished service.
Sir William's visit to this coast is purely
one of health and pleasure, his loug resi
dence here having endeared the Pacific
Slope to him. He says that while his ser
vices are at the disposal of the British
Government whenever it may neea them,
he is now on the retired list and is taking
no active interest in international affairs.
Freight on Wine Reduced.
Wine freight rates were reduced yesterday
by the Valiey road to $4 00 per ton in carload
lots from Fresno to feau Francisco. The South
ern Pacific rates were $5 80. The latter com
pany promptly met iv competitor's figure.

AN OLD MAN'S LOVE
Married a Waitress in Dead
wood and Disinherited
His Children.
The Young Widow Is Having a Hard
Time Fighting Off Her Three
Stepchildren.
Attorney J. C. McKee has filed an objec
tion with the Superior Court to the probat
ing of the will of Samuel Gwin and the
granting of letters oi administration to F.
J. Kierce.
McKee is acting in behalf of Frank P.
Gwin and William L. Gwin, two sons of
the deceased, residents of Idaho, and
Mary March, his daughter, who is married
and is living in Stockton.
The document riled gives an outline of
an interesting story of an old man's love
for a very young girl who was willing to
become his wile, although she cared only
for his wealth and not for him.
Samuel Gwin, as the story is told, was a
cattleman near Deadwood. Altnough 60
years of age and the reputed possessor of
over |200,000 he traveled from town to
town while visiting his cattle ranges.
During these.trips he encountered a bright
young girl who was still in her teens, and
who as a waitress at many of the country
hotels managed to attract his attention.
He wooed ncr and they finally became
wedded.
They lived together for twelve years
without issue, and during that time the
young wife made it her boast that she
cared not for her husband, but had simply
married him for his cold.
At the riDe age of 72 Gwin died and his
will was offered for probate in Idaho. The
District Court set aside the action of the
Probate Court and the widow appealed to
the Supreme Couit, where the case is still
pending.
The sons and daughter of] the deceased,
who were each left f 100 by their father,
object to their stepmother being virtually
the sole legatee, and it is they who have
been fighting the case. Recently they
learned through the usual formal publi
cation to that effect, that Airs. Gwin,
through her attorneys here, Wheaten,
Kalloch & Kierce. was endeavoring to
grab up teventy-two lots near Golden Gate
Park, owned by the estate, and the present
action is to prevent Kierce, the junior
member of the firm, fiqm becoming ad
ministrator;of that particular end of the
estate.

tom* service Will Be Held

tions to applicants. The first examina
tion In this City will take place October
12, 1896, instead of February 27, as pre
viously announced.
Under the new civil service rules, which

toms officers throughout the country were
advanced a point higher in the service and
their salaries were also increased. Several

sified and sworn in by Deputy Collector
Jerome. The changes in the several classes
affected, together with the compensation,
are as follows:
Charles J. Handley and William Simpson,
foremen class A to foremen in class E, with
compensation at the rate of $1100 each ; Mary
V. Lawrence and Mrs. Sadie Â£. Adams, inspec
tresses, class A to class E, with compensation
at the rate of $3 per diem ; Charles A. Sankey,

diem; eight night inspectors from class A to

ers and packers from class B to class C, with
compensation at the rate of $840 per annum;
seven messengers from class B to class C, with
compensation at $840 per annum ; A. M. John
son and Charles E. O'Nell. clerks, class B to
class C, with compensation at the rate of
$900; four watchmen from class C to class B,
with compensation at the rate of $780 per
annum; twenty-one laborers, heretofore un
classified, to be elevated to class C, with com
pensation at the rate of $840 per annum.
Pirri at the Chutes.
The individual with the lissome limbs and
lack of osseous substance in his make-up
known as tne "man-frog" concluded that it
was too damp, wet work monkeying around
the lake at the Chutes, and Thursday evening
he did not hop down the long slide into the
water. There are those wlio are small enough,
to say that he was afraid he would "croak,"
but few are paying any attention to a palpable
slur. To fill up the gap caused by his absence
Antonio Pirri was wired to at Los Angeles*,
and last evening he made one of his exciting
dashes down the chutes and into the lake on
his bicycle. He will repeat the feat this alter*
noon and evening.
Division 2 Drill*.
The second division of the police was put
through a drill on Vau Ness avenue yesterday
afternoon, preparatory to the police parada
that is to be held soon. About 250 fine look
ing officers were put through their stepsfunder
the direction of Captain Spillane, Captain
Gillen and Captain Dun levy. Those who have
seen both divisions ai drill state that the sec
ond is the more proficient. The men under
Captain Gillen did remarkably well. Chief
Crowley and CommissionerTobin were present
as interested spectators.
