CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 24.â Eight hun
dred citizens of East Liverpool, Ohio, un
der the auspices of the McKinley and Ho
bart Club of that city, arrived here this
morninp. East Liverpool is the center of
the pottery industry in Ohio, and most of
the men were workingmen from the pot
teries. This delegation came on a special
train and marched up the streets with
flags flying and bands playing.
The spokesman was introduced by Wil
liam Surls, the marshal of the day. The
spokesman was A. V. Blake, a potter who
works at the bench. He made an eloauent
address to Major McKinley, congratulat
ing him on the fact that he had remained
a true and steadfast advocate of protec
tion principles, and assured him that the
workingmen of Eastern Ohio were enthu
siastic in his support.
Three rousing cheers were given for
Major McKinley before he was permitted
to speak. Major McKinley spoke with
great vigor. He said that twenty years
ago he faced an East Liverpool audience
for tbe first time and that then as now he
was speaking for protection and sound
money. He then described present con
ditions, comparing them witn those which
existed under the Harrison administra
tion. "The way to help labor," declared
Major McKinley, "is to provide it with
steady work aaci good wages and then
have taese good wages always paid in
good money as sound as the Government
and as untarnished as its flag. No matter
what kind of money, we cannot get it
without work â whether it is poor or good,
gold or silver. We cannot get one dollar
unless wo have employment for our nands
and heads." This sentiment was greeted
with prolongea cheers.
A short lime after the East Liverpool
workingmen departed, a large delegation
of farmers from Knox County, Ohio,
marched up to the McKinley residence.
They were most warmly greeted along
their line of march. It was tbe first dele
gation composed entirely of farmers which
has visited Major McKiniey since his
nomination, and tnere was uncommon in
terest on the part of the citizens of Canton,
irrespective of party, to hear what the
farmers would say to Major McKinley and
what he would say to them. Their spokes
man, H. D. Critchfield, explained in his
address to Major McKinley that Knox
County is a typical agricultural commun
ity of the Central States and that it con
tains men of all shades of opinion. The
Populists have been active there, he said,
and still are. "But we are here to assure
you, Major McKinley, that the vote of
every Republican and some of the Demo
crats of the county will be cast for you."
When Major McKinley stepped upon a
chair to speak the 500 farmers who faced
him cheered long and lustily. Major Mc-
Kinley spoke with deliberation, at first
reading from a typewritten manuscript
He said in part:
I am giad especially to meet the farmers of
Knox County, for the farmers are the most
conservative force In our citizenship and in
our civilization. [Applause.] A force that
has always stood for good government, for
country, for liberty and for honesty. What
ever the farmer is suffering to-day is Decause
his competitors have increased in number and
because hit best customers are out of work.
[Applause and cries of "You are right."] Ido
not know that we can decrease the number of
your competitors, but with the adoption of a
true American protective policy we can set
your best customers to work. [Iremendous
cheers and cries of "Hurrah for McKinley."]
We have suffered in our foreign trade and
we have suffered in our domestic trade. The
farmers have suffered in their export trade
and they have likewise suffered in the home
market. Under the Republican tariff ltw of
1890 we imported in 1893 over 111,000,000
pounds of wool valuea at over $13,000,000.
In 1895, under the Democratic tariff law, we
Imported 248,000,000 pounds of wool valued
at $33,000,000. Nearly $20,000,000 worth
more of wool was imported under the Demo
cratic tariff law than under the Republican
tariff law in 1894. The imports of woolen
goods in 1894 amounted to $16,309,000 and
In 1895 to $75,495,000. From the reports ot
the Treasury Department at Washington we
find 47,243,000 sheep in the United States
valued Â«t $125,909,000.
On the Ist of January. 1896, there were
38,298,000 sheep in the United States, valued
at $65,000,000, a decrease of 9,000.000 in the
numbf r of sheep and of $60,000,000 in value.
Over $2,000,000 worth more of shoddy was
imported under tbe Democratic tariff law than
under the Republican tariff law. In woolen
goods the difference is more than $50,000,000
in favor of the foreign manufacturers. Tne
total loss in these three items to the American
wool-erower and the wage-earners in Ameri
can woolen factories is more than $62,000,000.
Is it any wonder, my fellow-citizens, that the
Bheep husbandry is no longer profitable ? So
with other agricultural products.
During the last seventeen months of the Re
publican tariff law there were imported 140,
-000,000 tons of hay. and during the first sev
enteen months of the Democratic tariff law
there were imported 373,000,000 tons. The
Wilson law gave the foreign producers a mar
ket for 233,000,000 tons more than they en
joyed in the last seventeen months under the
Republican tsriff law. This loss exceeds
$2,000,000. The total wneat, rye, barley,
jats and corn crops for 1895 amounted to
8,556,900,000 bushels. The total of this
The San Francisco Call.
product exported was 132,364,000 bushels, or
a little less than 4 per cent of the total
product annually, and more than 96 per cent
was consumed at home. The great bulk was
consumed by your fellow-citizens, your own
natural consumers iÂ»nd customers. In 1891-92
we exported $1,420,000 worth of agricultural
products. In 1895-96, tbe first two years un
der the Democratic tariff law, we exported
$1,124,000 worth. We exported, therefore,
$296,000 less in the two years undtr the Dem
ocratic tariff law than in tbe two years under
the Republican tariff law. Depression has
always followed low tariff legislation. It was
so after the tariff of 1846, and it has been so
under the tariff of 1894. [Applause.]
Can the farmer be helped by free coinage of
silver? [Cries of "No, do."] No, forever no,
my fellow-citizens. [Cries of "Hurrah for Mc-
Kinley."] He cannot be helped because if the
nominal price of grain was to rise to an infla
tion of the currency the price of everything
else would rise also, and the farmer would be
relatively no better off than he was before.
[Cries of "That's right, Major."] He would not
get any more real value for his grain than he
gets now and would suffer from the general
demoralization which would follow the free
coinage of silver. You cannot help the farmer
by more coinage of silver. He can only be
helped toy more consumers for his products.
You cannot help him by free trade; but, as I
have shown, he can be hurt and seriously hurt
by the free introduction of competing products
into this country. Better a thousand times
enlarge the markets for American products
than to enlarge the mints for the silver product
of the world. [Tremendous applause and cries
of "You are right."]
You might just as well understand that yon
cannot increase the value of anything by di
minishing the measure of the value with
which the thing is sold or exchanged. [Great
cheering and cries of " Hurrah for McKinley."]
If you can increase the value by lowering the
measure of value and you want to benefit the
farmer then make the bushel smaller, the
pound lighter, and declare a legal dozen less
than twelve. [Great laughter.] The home
market is the best friend of the far
mer. It is his best market It is his
only reliable market. He should be pro
tected in its enjoyment by wise tariff legisla
tion, and this home market should not be per
mitted to be destroyed by lessening the de
mand for American labor and diminishing the
pay of American workmen, and thereby dimin
ishing the demand for agricultural products.
[Applause.]
The sugar industry should be cultivated and
encouraged in the United States. Diversify
the products of agriculture and thus you will
have an additional employment for your land.
The only way to help the farmer is to increase
the demand for his farm products. This can
be.done by preserving a home market to him
and by extending our markets, which we did
In 1893-94 under the reciprocity provisions of
the tariff law of 1890. [Great cheering.] The
best consumers for the American products are
those at home. They consume eighteen times
as much cf the products of the American farm
as the foreign consumer. Free silver will not
cure over-production nor under-production.
[Laughter.] Free silver will not remove the
competition of Russia, India and the Argen
tine Republic. This competition would re
main if you coin all the silver in the world.
Free silver will not increase the demand for
your wheat or make a single new â consumer.
You don't get consumers througn the mints.
[Great laughter and cries of "No, no."] You
get them through the factories. [Cries of
"That's right."] You will not get them by in
creasing the circulation of money in the
United States; you will only get them by in
creasing the manufacturing establishments in
the United States. [Tremendous cheering.]
"Plant the factory by the farm," said Jackson,
and that is as wise now as when the hero of
New Orleans said it years ago. The best thing
now is for the farmer to have a factory for his
neighbor. [Laughter and applause.] It would
be better to have a factory alongside of you
than to have another farm alongside of you.
[Laughter and cries ol "Yes."] In 1892, when
free trade was the battle-cry of our opponents,
it wag said then that the farmers would follow
this heresy, but it was not so ; it was the cities
which followed the free-trade heresy. The
country voted for protection. So this year the
farmers will vote against free trade and free sil
ver. They will vote for a home market and for
a dollar as good as gold in every mart and
market of ihe world. [Great cheering.]

State Committee met to-night and agreed
upon Congressman Frank Black of Troy
for temporary chairman.
The convention will be called to order at
noon to-morrow by Chairman Benjamin

It will be remembered in what personal
language he addressed Warner Miller at
the meeting of .the New York State dele

chosen chairman of the delegation as
against Mr. Miller. The Herkimer County
contest is expected to present a most inter

the affidavits of thirty-four out of the
sixty-eight delegates to the convention
who will swear they voted with him.
Titus Sheard claims to have a like num

WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 24.â There
is now scarcely a doubt but that President
Cleveland will oppose the ticket nomi
nated at Chicago and lend bis support to
the nominees of the convention to be held
at Indianapolis on September 2. Whether
the conflicting reports on this subject
have been because of doubt and hesitation
on Mr. Cleveland's part or have been due
to a deliberate purpose to keep up the in
terest and open the way for a dramatic an
nouncement just at the proper minute can
not be said. It is a fact, though, that Mr.
Cleveland is in sympathy with the In
dianapolis movement being carried to the
full length of making a nomination, and
those of his Cabinet who remain with him
intend to support that ticket.
They are not willing to support McKin

ley directly, though they hope to contrib
ute to his election. From their point of
view the nomination of an Ohio man was
a mistake. II Reed were the Republican
nominee they would join the Republicans
and give him their support directly, and
with great good will ; but a regard for Mr.
Cleveland's past record constrains them to
refuse their indorsement of McKinley.
They feel that as the case stands they are
compelled to make a choice between Cleve
landism and McKinleyism. This has de
termined them to run an independent
ticket. The decision is final.
Carlisle was first choice for the head of
the ticket, but he is not willing to accept.
Carlisle thus being taken out of consider
ation the intention is to select the head of
the ticket from either Indiana, Ohio or
Illinois. Their fight during the campaign
is to be confined chiefly to these three
States, Minnesota, North Carolina, Geor
gia, Kentucky, Alabatra and Texas.
They do not expect to make any campaign
in States where it is believed the bulk of
the gold Democrats would vote for Mc-
Kinley if an independent ticket were not
in the field. In the States named they be
lieve most of the gold Democrats would, if
an independent ticket were not in the
field, either vote for Bryan or else not vote
at all.
Mr. Cleveland intends to publicly de
clare himself about the time of the meet
ing of the Indianapolis convention, and
from that time all the influence of the ad
ministration and all the machinery avail
able at their hands will be directed to the
support of the Indianapolis ticket.
Neither Mr. Cleveland nor any member
of his Cabinet at that time will recognize
the Chicago convention as representing
the Democratic party, and loyalty to the
new nomination will be expected from
every one attached to the administrution.
The supt)ort of Bryan by any one attached
to the administration will be looked upon
as the support of Harrison would have
been during Mr. Cleveland's first term.
The retirement of Secretary Smith is a
pretty Droad hint to Bryan supporters
holding office under Mr. Cleveland.
Smith retires of his own motion, being so
impelled by his appreciation ot the situa
tion, and of course there is not a perfect
analogy between his case and that of per
sons in a less prominent position. Any
one, however, who supports Bryan will be

YOSEMITE, Cal., Aug. 24.â A1l that
remains of the Stoneman House, the
State's hostelry, known to every tourist
who has visited Yosemite Valley in the
| past ten years, is a heap of smouldering
i ruins. Fire destroyed the structure early
this morning, and not even the smallest
of its tenants' belongings was saved from
the flames. This hotel, erected a decade
ago. was named after Governor Stoneman.
It was leased by tne State, but has never
paid a cent on the investment of puolic
funds.
Shortly before 2 o'clock this mornine
the roof of the attic on tbe third floor was
discovered to De on fire by the steward of
the house, Frank Reisner. He gave the
alarm to those on the first floor and then
rushed upstairs expecting to reach the
hose in the attic, but the flames drove
him back and he had to flee for his life
down the crooked stairway. Those in the
house and on the first floor were J. J.
Cook, the proprietor; Clerk L. F. Starks,
Dr. Lincoln and wife, who have lived at
and taken care of the house for several
y ars; Miss Fanny Bruce of Wawona, a
niece of Mr. Cook, and Miss Ethel Becht
of San Francisco.
The building burned rapidly and within
a half hour the flames had eaten their
way down to the porch of the ground
floor and the Stoneman was abandoned to

its fate. A few momenta later there was
left standing but one of the concrete flues
of the State's $60,000 hostelry and $25,000
worth of furniture had been destroyed.
The furniture belonged to Mr. Cook and
waa insured for $15,000. The store and
billiard hall ne^ar by were saved.
The origin of the fire is unkuown, but
the building had been ignited on three
former occasions by defective Hues or
sparks falling on the roof, and to one of
these causes the conflagration is at*
tributed. The house was closed for the
season on Saturday evening and the last
guests, Albert Schmidt and wife of East
Oakland, departed yesterday morning.
They were the last of many thousands
who had been entertained there since
1888, when the hostlery was opened by J>
J. Cook.
The construction of the Stdneman
House was commenced in 1886 and com
pleted in 1888, in time for that season's
travel. The sum of $40,000 had been ap
propriated for its construction and the
contract was let to Carl, Croly & Aber
natby, then of Sacramento, for a few dol
lars less than the appropriation. The
plan called lor brick flues, but tne con
tractors found they couid build concrete
ones cheaper and so bad the plans
changed.
The concrete foundation was laid almost
on tbe surface of the giound, and before
the building wos completed it commenced
to fag, cracking the plastered walls and
rendering the flues more dangerous. A
second appropriation of $10,000 had to be
made to pipe spring water to the house,
and another $10,000 was expended for
necessary repairs. Even more than the
annual rental of $1200 has been used on
its rapairs.

The Murdered Man's Grave Dese
crated by Those Who Pro

WEAVERVILLE, Cal., Aug. 24.-
Slowly but surely all the details of the
awful plot that ended in the murder of
"Jack" Littlefield are being Drought out at
tbe trial of Joe Gregory. Sensational waa
to-day's testimony â revolting in part â and
ever and anon in the records of the court
stenographer appears the name of George
B. White, Round Valley's king.
When the case was called this morning
James Wilbunr, who was on the stand Sat
urday night, was almost immediately dis
missed and was replaced by Johnnie
Wathen, the son of "Wylackie John" and
stepson to Yes Palmer. An objection was
taken to his testifying, as it was decid ed
to prove that a conspiracy existed before
the witness' testimony would be permissi
ble. Therefore, Walter Clark was placed
upon the stand.
He testified he last saw "Jack" Little
field from the Red Mountain House on
the morning of September 28. Littletield
was hanging by a rope around his neck
from the iimb of a black oak tree. When
he went to the body he found that the
neck and clothing were bloody from three
bullet wounds, and he saw two pools of
blood upon tbe earth near a pine tree five
or six feet from the corpse, where, it is
supposed, "Jack" Littlefield fell and was
dispatched. His hat was then resting
upon his shoulders. Among those present
at the place were George Cam mines, the
two Van Horns, Claud Clark, George
Black and the witness' wife.
Frank Doolittle testified that he resided
at Red Mountain House and was
acquainted with the defendants and with
George E. White and Tom Henley. During
a preliminary trial of Yes Palmer and
"Jack" Littlefield at Covelo, where they
were jointly charged by George White
with stealing a bald-faced mule , he beard
Vinton, Crow, Van Horn, Haydon and
Gregory discussing the advisability of
banging or killing Littlefield and Palmer.
They said thai if they could not convict
them by law in Mendocino County they
would bang them.
An objection was made by the defense
to a question in relation to George E.
White, and Attorney Post said that he
would prove the conspiracy was planned
at White's house, and that White would
be about as prominent a figure as there
was in the case before he pot through.
It was decided to hang Yes Palmer along
witn Littlefield, the witness continued. It
was charged by Vinton and others that
both had been in the somewhat risky busi
ness of stealing cattle for years and that
they were "no good." Those discussing
the feasibility of hanging littlefield in
Covelo at the time were John Crow, John
Vinton, Joe Gregory and Tom Haydon.
"Did you agree witn them that it would
be a good scheme?" questioned Oregon
Sanders.
"Well," replied the witness, "I did not
say anything against it"
"Are you aware that if the conspiracy is
established you will hang, along with the
rest of the Round Valley people?"
"Well, I can't help it if I do."
"Did you ever hear George White discuss'2
the advisability of killing Jack Little
field?'
"Yes, sir."
When askÂ«Â»d if there were any others
who had expressed a similar opinion the
witness replied that there were fifteen or
twenty. The defense attempted to show
that it was the universal sentiment of
Round Valley that Palmer and Littletield
should be tilled, and Sanders suggested to
Post that ne supposed them all guilty and
in need of hanging. Post said that about
twenty-five of them certainly were, and
probably would be hanged if the case had
been tried in Sacramento County instead
of Trinity County, which is too poor to
bear the expense of such a trial.
"When you are Judge," suggested Sand
ers. ,
"1 think not," said Post, "for I would
be disqualified, as I most certainly have
an opinion."
The witness told of a visit to the house
of George White to solicit his support in
procuring a lawyer to convict Littlefield
for stealing his mule. He said, "White, I
want you to stand in with me and get a
lawyer." White refused and asked why
he did not "do up" Littlefieid. "You
wouldn't have any law out there to trouble
you." the cattle king declared.
Witness Doolittle told of several in
stances when he heard conversations re
lating to the proposed killing of Little
field. Gregory ha i told him at two or
three places in Covelo and at the Red
Mountain House that he had good back
ing to undertake the job, naming among
his backers the two Grist brothers, George
E. White, Tom Henley, John Rohrbougb,
â¢' Jim " Rebe and Captain Dingnam. Doo
little also had a conversation at Ukiab, in
regard to killing Littlefie.d, with Joe
Gregory, Baylis Van Horn and Tom fiay
don. They stated that they were going to
"do him up" by hanging him. Vinton
wanted the witness to kill Palmer and
Gregory.
riaydon said that men that bad done
them the dirt that they had ought to be
shot down in their tracks any time they '
met them. Buck Lacock urged the ad
visability of killing Littlefield and Palmer.
A half-dozen more, including John (row,
thought Doolittle ought to kill "Jack"
Littletield and Joe Gregory. Cummins,
the cons-table, also mentioned the killing
of Littlefield, a#^did George White and all
of the Van Horns.
Doolittle admitted that he had said that
Littierield ought to be killed.
At this juncture, Judge Post notified the
only woman spectator in court, wno had
assumed the time-honored distinction of
distributing bouquets among the prisoners,
that some very plain languaee was about
to De used, and if she did not wish t o be
shocked she should leave the room.
Then followed a bit of testimony regard
ing the manner in which Joe Gregory
desecrated the grave of Littlefieldâ so bar
barous, revolting and inhuman that a
shudder passed over the auditors.
Doolittie resumed his testimony con
cerning the threats against Littlefield.
'"And," interrupted Lawyer Sanders,
â¢'you did not think that Mount Shasta ;
would bo into mourning if he was killed?
And you would not wear crape on your
arm and go into mourning if he was
killed?"
"I don't know as I would particularly."
"And you had not anything left for him
to steal, and therefore you were willing
for him to live? "
'â¢Oh, I did not want him Killed over it."
"Did the Sheriff ask you to tell if you
knew who it was who shot Vinton?"
"Don't know as he ever did?"
"Has he been to you to see who it was
that shot one of our witnesses over there
the other dayâ Mr. Sherman at Covelo?"
This qncsiion brought on a discussion
between the attorneys as to whether the
witness was testifying for the defense or
not. The witness said that no one had
promised him money, provisions or re
ward as an incentive for him to testify for
the pecple. He stated that he had earned
his way to Weaverville in company with
the Lone Ridgers, showing them where to
camp on the way, hunting and cutting bee
trees for tuem. He acknowledged that he
had bad trouble with Joe Gregory about
three years ago.
George White, Vinton, Thompson and
Alec Terry, he continued, said there
should be no talk before outsiders about
the proposed killing. When asked to
name some of the White faction, he men
lioned Judge Spauiding, Alec Perry,
Charley Hurt, the Englishes, Frank
Thompson, ' "Jim" Rife, the Grist brothers,
the two Rohrboughs, Captain Dingbam,
Tom Haydon, H. C. Simmons, Tom Hen
ley, Buck Lacock, Watkins and son,
Handy and the Van Horns.
"Have any of them been to the peniten
tiary for cattle stealing?" was asked.
"I guess they haven't," was the reply.
'They have been pretty close to it,
tboueh."
"Well, who?"
"Tom Haydon for one, and I put up my
money to save him."
Dan McDonald was next called to tes
tify. He said that in the early part of the
summer of 1895, in company with Tom
Haydon, Mrs Haydon and John M. Vin
ton, he had heard them talk of killing
Littiefield. He said that Haydon came
out of the kitcheTi to where they were sit
ting around the fireplace and said :
"I see Jack Littlefield over on the
Wylackie range near the log cabin."
Vinton arose, went out with Mrs, Hay
don toward the north of the building Â«nd
returned, saying:
'â¢That's so; they are over there. Now
would be a good time to hang 'Jack' Lit
tlefield."
Mrs. Haydoo asked: "What about little
Johnnie Wathen?"
Vinton replied: "Hang him to the next
tree. Dead men tell no tales."
McDonald then left Haydon's house in
company with Vinton for Lacock's house,
where Vinton said to Lacock: "We have
seen 'Jack' Littlefield and Johnnie
Wathen on the Wylackie range to-day,
and we were talking of going over and
banging him."
Lacock replied : "Well, it is not too late
yet. I'll count them over and see who
will go."
Amone those chosen or counted were:
Lacock, Vinton, Artie Watkins, Tom Hay
don, Fred Lynch and tbe witness, Mc-
Donald. The witness objected to being
counted in, and Vinton remarked: "No;
don't count him. He isn't quite as game
as the balance." Buck Lacock said he had
a white mare that would puil hard on a
rope to hang Littlefield.
On cross-examination McDonald testi
fied that Vinton had offered him $20 and
a suit of clothes if he would kill Little
field and Palmer, and that he (Vinton)
would furnish the Winchester and car
ridges. Rife had told him that if Greg
ory ever turned up missing "Jack" Little
field and Yes Palmer would nans within
forty-eight hours. When the witness in
formed "Jack" Littlefield of the conspiracy
to take his life Littlefield said he didn't
think anybody was cowardly enough to
hang him.
George Russell testified that Vinton had
said that if he "could not get rid of him
(Littlefield) by law be knew well how
he could get rid of him."
THE hEItTILLOX SYSTEM.
Thorough Test to be Made by the War
Itrpartinent.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 24.â The
army medical department will make a
trial of the Bertillon system of identifica
tion. It is on the suggestion of an army
surgeon who believe* that the method is an
improvement over the present practice of
keeping track of deserters and other un
desirable characters who may attempt to
re-enter the army. Army surgeons, how
ever, do not believe the French system
will be an improvement over the prevail
ing practice. They fear that the liability
to error is greater, especially where there
iÂ« so much likelihood of carelessness on
the part of operators. The War Depart
ment, however, has sent to Paris for a set
of Bertillon instruments and a thoroueh
examination will be made into the system.

WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 24,âOrders

CONVENTION OF
REPUBLICAN CLUBS
Leaders Assemble for the
League's Ninth Annual
Session.
AFTER THE PRESIDENCY
Many Men Anxious to Preside
Over the Notable National
Organization.
M'ALPIN MAY BE RE-ELECTED.
Now the League Is Self-Sustaining
and Will Be an Important Factor
in the Campaign.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Aug. 24.â The
indications to-night are that when the Na
tional Convention of Republican League
Clubs is called to order in ninth annual
session at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning
by President McAlpin nearly every State
in the Union will be represented. Dele
gations have been coming in all day and
the hotels to-night represent quite an
ante-convention appearance. Many of
them have opened State headquarters at
the Ptister and Plankinton and the can
vass for the presidency for the ensuing
year is being actively waged. This and
the contest over the selection for the
place for the next meeting are really the
only matters of interest to engage the at
tention of delegates.
There is nothing to show that the at
tendance of visitors from abroad will un
duly tax the accommodations or hospital
ity of the city. Owing to the demands of
the campaign and the hold.ng of several
State conventions this weeks many public
men and politicians, who would otherwise
have been present, will not be here and
the list of speakers arranged for the edifi
cation of the convention is notable chiefly
for the omission of prominent leaders of
party. The members of the National
Committee located at Chicago in charge of
the campaignâ Messrs. Payne of Wisoon
sin, Dawes of Illinois, Durbin of Indiana
a*nd Cummines of lowa â will be here in
the morning and several of them will ad
dress the meeting Wednesday nigut. Ex-
Speaker Spooner of this State is also ex
pected in the morning to take part in the
convention. V
The contest for president is still an open
affair and no candidate is likely to go into
the balloting with a commanding lead.
Charles U. Gordon of Illinois, who is be
ing championed by Committeeman Dawes,
and who, whether rightly or wrongly, is
credited with being the choice of the Na
tional campaign managers, is the favorite
to-night, with D. D. Woodmansee of Ohio
a close second.
The latter has the support of the Ohio
and Indiana delegations. General McAl
pin is credited with being unwilling to ac
cept another term, but his State delegation
and other Eastsrn men will urge bis name
upon the convention. It has been the
policy of the Ibague to give its president a
re-election. Mr. Warkson, Senator Thurs
ton and W. W. Tracy each served two
years. A new candidate appeared in the
held this afternoonâ F. R. Conway of
lowa, president of the league of that State
and the Public Printer of lowa. The
Hawkeye delegation has been credited
as supporters of Nebraska's candidate,
John L. Webster of Omaha, but at their
meeting to-day decided to ask the honor
of the presidency for their own State.
There is no opposition to the re-election of
M. J. Dowling as secretary.
Half a dozen cities want to entertain
the next conventionâ Portland, Or.,
Omaha, Nebr., New Orleans, Boston. Chat
tanooga and Detroit. The choice will de
pend largely upon the outcome of the
fight for the presidency. If that goes
East the convention will probably go
West, and vice versa.
The business of the convention will
probably be concluded at Wednesday's
session.
Secretary Dowling reported to the ex
ecutive committee at a meeting held to
night the result of the year's work and
the plans of the league in the present
campaign. All the bills contracted for by
the present committee, together with a
few small liabilities incurred by their pre
decessors, have been met, and a clean bal
ance sheet will be turned over to the suc
cessors. For the first time in the history
of the National League the organization
has been self-sustaining.
The National Republican Campain Com
mittee has organized a league bureau as
one of its adjuncts, and Mr. Dowling has
been placed in charge at headquarters in
Chicago. He will supervise the distribu
tion of all league literature and decide all
matters pertaining to league work. As
soon as practicable after the adjournment
of the present oonvention a branch bureau
will be established at headquarters in New
York in connection with the work in that
section of the country. Within the past
year the organization of Republican league
clubs has been extended into every State
and Territory in the Union, and represen
tatives will be present at this convention,
Mr. Dowling stated, from every State and
Territory except some of the Southern
States. The reason for their absence, he
said, was that the railroads in that part of
the country refused to make special rates.
There is at present in National head
quarters a list of every club in the United
States, with the local organization. They
number, Mr. Dowling stated, more than
20,000, and the average membership is up
ward of 100, indicating a total enrollment
of over 2,000,000 voters in these organiza
tions.
Under the auspices of the league a poll
is being made, chiefly in the villages and
towns, giving names and postoffice ad
dresses of bolters from the two parties â
Democrats who have announced their in
tention to vote for McKinley and Repub
licans for Bryan. Mr. Dowling says the
reports thus far received show that the
Democratic bolters for McKinley out
number the Republican bolters for Bryan
by about 25 percent.

PRESIDENT WARNER'S ADDRESS.
An Appeal Issued to 'the Friends of
Bimetallism.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 24.â President
Warner of the American Bimetallic
Union to-night issued an address j; "To
the friends of -bimetallism in the United
States." He reviews the situation from a
point of view favorable to free coinage
and says the question should be carefully
studied by every voter before he casts his
ballot. The address continues: ;.":
This cannot be done through the medium of
the ordinary daily newspapers, for as a rule they
are filled with catch phrases and appeals to
special interests that are simply intended to
prejudice and mislead. By far tha best method
of diffusing education upon this subject Is
through the medium of clubs and leagues or
unions.. Such organizations bring the voters
together in compact bodies and enable them
to collectively obtain at nominal rates the very
best literature extant. This in turns leads to
discussions, not only by speakers trom the
platform, but between individuals. As a re
sult the chaff is separated from the solid grain,
the essential and material matter is sifted out
of a great mass that really does m . tcucti the
essence of the question at all. The great con
test is now on ana it can only be settled at the
polls. To the end tbat the decision may be
right the American Bimetallic Union strongly
urges the formation of silver clubs and leagues
in every State, county, city, town and school
district in the Union.
President Warner pledges his organiza
tion to aid in the work of organization and
education to the best of its ability, pro
viding free such literature as can be so
furnished, and all tbat necessarily involves
expenses will be provided at cost.
Detailed instructions as to the plan of
organization will be furnished on applica
tion to the main office of the union at 134
Monroe street, Chicaco, or to the branch
office, Sun building, Washington, D. C.

JOURNEYS ON TO WINNISOOK.
A Little Reception at the Ledge That
Gladdened the H art of the
Wanderer.
UPPER RED HOOK, N. V., Aug. 24.â
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan left Upper Red Hook
for Winniaook Lodge, m the Catskills, at
noon to-jlay. They drove in a carriage as
far as Rhinecliff, where they crossed the
river to Rondout and took the train for
Big Indian station. Ta*>y were accom
panied to Rhinecliff by their hosts, Mr.
and Mrs. E. C. Perrineil.
KINGSTON, N. V., Aug. 24.â Reaching
Rhinecliffe at 1:30. Mr. and Mrs. Bryan
were met by Charles A. Sohultz, repre
senting the Winnisook Club. At 2 o'clock
the party crossed the Hudson to Kingston
Point on a tug, and the candidate was
greeted at the landing by several hundred
people, who so effectually barred his pro
gress that quite a struggle ensued before
he could reach the Ulster and Delaware
train waiting to take him to Bi,r Indian.
A special car had been attached to the
train, and standing on the steps of this
Mr. Bryan, in response to loud calls, made
a short speech. He said :
I never see people gathering together with
out wanting to make a speech. I be.leve I
represent the best interest of the American
people. I bdieve in platformsâ platforms not
to get In on, but platforms to stand on wfien
you get in. I believe the money question is
the paramount issue of this campaign. 1 want
you to study the question, and when you study
remember there are tome people who firmly
believe in the gold standard. {Voice in the
crowd, "That's good."] If you believe in bi
metallism you ought to believe in it to the ex
tent that you will vote with those who want to
bring "it about. No political party has ever
declared for the gold standard. The man
who advocates the gold standard in this
country is a man without a party, and the mau
who thinks the gold standard is a bad thing,
but that this Nation must suffer under it until
some other cation comes to our relief, will.be
a man without a party alter this election if I
am anything of a prophet. We must make
politics a business this year. A man who has
a large business is as much interested tn it as
a man who has a small business. It is all you
have and you have as much right to protect
your small interests aa other men have to pro
tect their large interests. But I must close,
for if I take much longer I will have made a
speech.
The people were very enthusiastic and
cheered frequently. They shouted a
hearty farewell as the trails started. About
forty people were waiting to receive Mr.
Bryan at the Kingston station. They
shouted for a speech, but the candidate
s ook his head. "I am going to speak for
a fejy minutes here to-morrow," he told
then;, "and therefore will not speak any
to-day. lam glad to see you."
Most of the crowd took the last remark
for an invitation and pushed forward to
shake bands with the nominee. The
handshaking was lively until ex- Assem
blyman John D. Cumroings. standing be
side Mr. Bryan on the platform, followed
the announcement that the nominee
would speak at the Kingston Town Hall at
1 o'clock to-morrow afternoon with the
statement that Mrs. Bryan was pres
ent at the opposite end of the car. Then
there was a rush in Mrs. Bryan's end of
the car, and until the train started at 2:30,
she divided honors with her husband.
A large crowd was gathered at Jtflg In
dian and everybody seemed to be enthu
siastic. The nominee was conducted to
the porch of a hotel and here he made a
few remarks, which seemed to please most
of the crowd. At places all along the ten
miles of rough road from Big Indian to
Winnisook Lodge people were gathered to
see the Democratic candidate.
It was 6:30 o'clock this evening when
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan, under escort of Mr.
Schultz and Mr. Preston, ex-examiner of
State Banks of New York, reached Winni
sook Lodge, after a long drive over moun
tain roads from Big Indian. They had
greatly enjoyed thedrive, and the warmth
of their reception by the members of the
Winnisook Club, their wives and fam
ilies, made it all seem like a home
coming instead of greeting in "the ene
my's country." Major Hinckley, Mr.
Benedict, Mrs. George K. French of
Washington, Mrs. Schultz and others re
ceived Mr. and Mrs. Bryan as they
alighted from their carriage in front of the
Winnisook Clubhouse. The bevy of bo
journers gathered there gave the club yell
and the candidate and his wife bowed
their thanks. Then Mr. Benedict and his
daughter, Mrs. French, took them in
charge and conducted them to the Bene
dict cottage. Mr. and Mrs. Bryan had
supper in the clubhouse with their many
hosts, and later in the evening they were
entertained there informally.
SUGGESTING A PLATFORM.
National Democrat* iteceive Vointers
From Many Source*.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ikd., Aug. 25.â The
platform of the National Democratic narty
is in course of formation. Chairman By
num of the executive committee has a
stack of letters from some of the most
prominent Democrats in the country mak
ing suggestions on this subject, and some
of them have forwarded complete drafts
of platforms embodying their views.
Theqe uÂ« will turn over to the resolutions
committee to be appointed by the con
vention in order that it may have the ben
efit of them id drawing ub platforms. In
a letter concerning thie subject Abram S.
Hewitt, ex-Mayor of New York, expresses
himself thus:
"My view is substantially that there is
but one issue to be represented to tb*i peo
ple of the United States. The Democratic
convention at t Chicago made 55 a distinct
declaration of war upon the constitution
of = the ;i United ; States. The issue, there
fore, is not \ financial or I economic, but lit
concerns the perpetuity of republican in
stitutions. In the presence of this issue
all other questions sink into insignificance,
just as they did when civil war threatened
the rxj'tf-nrn c h" G.^i-rnrnpru. . I think,
therefore, that the constitution should be
made the prominent if not tbe sole topic
for consideration. It seems to me that
the people can be made to see that the
bulwark of their liberty is assailed in its
most vulnerable point, and that the over
throw of the constitution will lead first to
anarchy and then to despotism."
S. O. Pickens, chairman of the National
Democratic State Committee, returned to
day from New York, having been in at
tendance upon the meeting of the Amer
ican Bar Association at Saratoga.
"I find in ttfe East," said he, "a very-fa
vorable disposition toward the National
Democratic movement, much more so
than was the case two weeks ago. I don't
mean by that that there were ever any
dangers of the Eastern States going for
the Chicago ticket and platform, but they
had a different idea from ours how to
remedy the situation. They believed that
th 3 proper thing to do was to rebuke the
party by voting for McKinley electors.
But they are now beginning to realize that
another organization is necessary to pre
serve the party in the Middle, Southern
and Western States. It is uncertain yet
what the regular organization in New York
will do. They seem to be waiting for Hill
to take a stand. I think that he will land
in the Bryan camp, for I have never
thought that we could count upon him.
And, mark you, that will be the last of
Mr. Hill in politics. Our movement there
has the cordial support of the anti-snap
pers, or the Cleveland Democracy, and
there is no question about tbe rank and
file of the New York Democrats being op
posed to the Chicago ticket."
ARE KINDLY RECEIVED.
But Democrat* Will Hot Grant the lif-
qneat of the Z,ndie*.
CHICAGO. 111., Aug. 24.â Sound-money
Democratic headquarters has been lively
all day with visitors, the great majority of
whom are here as delegates to the State
Convention to meet to-morrow at Battery
D. During the afternoon a delegation of
women, headed by Catherine Waugh Me-
Cullcch, called to ask the indorsement of
Dr. Julia Holmes Smith, candidate on the
Democratic ticket for trustee of the State
University. The ladies were kindly re
ceived, but a deaf ear will be turned to
their request. The State Executive Com
mittee held a session lasting nearly three
hours, but declined to make public any
thing done. Another rneetine was held
in the evening, in which leading delegates
from out of town were given an opportu
nity to assist in mapping out the pro
gramme for to-morrow's convention.
At the evening meeting the temporary
organization was settled upon with ex-
Senator Lloyd Hamilton of Springfield as
chairman. The platform will be a very
strong document, coming out rHt-footediy
in indorsement of the National adminis
tration and declaring for sound money.
The probaoiiities are that General .Black
will he nominated for Governor, Chester
A. Babcock for Lientenant-Governor and
Edward Ridtely of Springfield for Treas
urer.
A report that President Cleveland had
written a letter indorsing the sound
money movement, which was circulated
during the conference, evoked much en
thusiasm and the leaders feel encouraged
over the outlook to-night.
STONE VISITS JONES.
The Political , Situation Canvassed at

CHICAGO, :; 111.,, Auk. 24. â Governor
Stone of Missouri stopped over on his way
home from the East this afternoon, and
spent three hours in , earnest conference
with Chairman Jones at Democratic Na
; tional [ headquarters.; The j political situa- .
tion was thoroughly discussed, but no de
tails were given out as to the matters con
sidered. r . ;;.â ;Â«^;.-^ : :l\t/ ;â¢ .â - l'i T /l\ â¢ \\ i : :.
D. F. Shively, Democratic nominee for
Governor of Indiana, accompanied by Mr.
Fanning, Candidate for Auditor on the
same ticKet, and Senator Leon Bai.ey of
Ind.ana, aiso called at headquarters.
Other visitors were Secretary of Slate Hin
richsen of Illinois; General A. J. Warner
of Ohio, president of the American Bi
metallic Union, and J. A. Creighton of
Omaha, a member of thÂ« Bryan notifica
tion committee, now on his way home.
Secretary Walsh of the National Commit
tee arrived here to-day.
Will not Anne Wntrerson.
LOUISVILLE, Kt., Aue. 24.â Kentucky
will hardly name Mr. Wauerson for the
Presidency at the National Democratic
Convention. The delegates from this city
have been instructed for ex-Governor S. B.
Huckner for Vice-Presiaent. and it would
be embarrassing to name candidates for
both places on the ticket. His name will
probably be presented by Illinois.
THIS WILL MEAN
BRYAN'S DEFEAT
f Continued from JFirtt rage. 1
regarded by Cleveland ad an enemy to the
administration.
The fact is that he will go inter this
fight with much more feeling than he has
into any fight against ihe Republican
party. He will regard it as his duty not
to leave anything undone which might
discourage the support of Bryan and con
tribute to his defeat. The calculation is
that by confining their efforts to the
States named the third ticket will not
draw many votes from McKinley, and
that they will insure McKinlev's carrying
Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky, with a
probability that he will also carry Ala
bama, Texas and perhaps Georeia.
It is likely that members of the Cabinet
will take th? stump for tbe independent
ticket.
GENERAL HARRIES GONE.

HOT SPRINGS, 8. Dak., Aug. 24.-Gen
eral Thomas H. Harriet dropped dead
from beait disease while taking a vapor
bath at this place this morning. He was

tbe Pittsburg and Western Railroad,
which was due in this city at 12:35 P. M.,
was wrecked at Valencia, a small station
twenty miles west of here, at 11:30 o'clock

The injured were brought to the Alle
gheny General Hospital by a special
train.
The Chicago express train does not stop
at Valencia and was running at about the
rate of forty miles an hour when the
engineer first discover d the obstruction
on the tracks. He reversed and applied
the brakes, but though the speed of toe
express was diminished somewhat it
struck the freightcars on the main track
with frightful force, and the freightcars
and engine rolled in a mans of torn wood
and iron over an embankment into the
ditch below.
The engineer and fireman of the express,
when they saw that a collision was inev
itable, jumped and escaped with severe
injuries. Tbe tender, mail, express and
passenger coaches piled up over each other
and rolled down the embankment on the
wrecked engine and freighicars. Clouds of
steam and smoke from the disabled en
gine enveloped the scene and added to the
distress of the injured pinioned in the
wreck, who feared the debris would take
fire and burn them alive.
Meanwhile, those of the express crew
and passengers who were not injured, the
crew of the freight train and people of
Valencia who wer â¢ near at band when the
accident occurred, rushed to the aid of the
injured, and a special trajn with surgeons
was at once dispatched from Allegheny to
the scene of the wreck. The freightcars,
which were struck by the express, were
heavily loaded with long iron piping.
These heavy iron tub*s were hurled with
great force through the sides of the day
coaches, and most of the fatal injuries to
passengers were produced by them.
GOOD SPEED OF THE BROOKLYN
In a Preliminary Practice Trial the Cruiser
Goes Almost Twenty-One Knots
an Hour.
BOSTON, Mass., Aug. 24.â 1n the pre
liminary or practice trial to-day the
cruiser Brooklyn developed an average
speed closely approximating twenty-one
knots. There were, of course, no official
figures whioh could have any impartial or
valuable bearing. Watches were held by
all the officers aboard, and also by those
members of the Government trial board,
and close calculations were made from
buoy to buoy ia the run of eighty-three
knots.
A comparison of these different figures
showed an agreement that the cruiser had
averaged a few one hundreths less than
twenty-one knots. The computations
ranged from 20.26 to 20.99, the majority
however, settling on 20.97, The trial was
made over the Government official course
from oft Cape Ann, Mass., to a point off
Point Porpoise, Me., and return. Th*
measured distance between the two points
is 41>Â£, thus making the full run cf eighty
three knots, including the turn.
Edwin S. Cramp, after the return to-day
expressed himself as entirely satisfied with
the behavior of. the cruiÂ«er, but would
make no prediction as to the possibilities
of the official trial on Wednesday.

SON AND DAUGHTER SLAIN.
An Atrocious Crime Committed by an Un-
known Assassin in Mi/am
County, Texas,
CALVERT. Tex., Aug. 24.â News bat
just be^n received from Milaru County of
one of the most atrocious crimes ever com
mitted in the central part of Texas â the as
sassination of tbe son and daughter of
Martha McCullougb.
The couple were sitting on the porch
talking together in the cool of the evening.
Suddenly the sound of a rifle shot was
heard, and the two who had just been talk
ing together fell to the floor of the porch.
Assistance was summoned at once, but Jit
tie could be done. A rifle ball had passed
through the neck of the son, killing him
almost instantly. The ball then passed
into the body of the daughter. Bhe lin
gered for several hours, but died during
the night.
There is no suspicion as to who com
mitted the deed. Great indignation is
felt by the neighbors of the McCulloughs,
and if the murderer be caught he will be
dealt with bummarily. A search has been
made throughout the neighbornood, but
so far it has been wholly without result.
There is a theory that the shot may
have been accidental, but this theory is
scouted by those in the neighboorhood,
who do not believe that a chance hunter
would have so quickly and completely dis
appeared and left no trace behind him.
It is generally believed, however, that the
killing of the girl was accidental and that
the assassin aimed at her brother.
HURT BY A MAD HORSE.
Desperate Fight With a Nag That Was
Bitten 6]/ a Dog.
BLOOMFIELD, N. J., Aug. 24.â WaJlacÂ«
Lyon, proprietor of the Washington Hotel
in the Brooklyn section, was bitten Be
vereJy by a horse yesterday afternoon.
Lyon entered the stall to leed the animal,
and it suddenly gave a scream of anger
and fastened its teeth in his back near the
left shoulder. At the same time thÂ«
horse kicked at him with his forefeet.
Lyon struck the horse on the head with
a wooden measure over his right shoulder
until the animal loosened his hold, and he
then sprang out of the stall as the horse
tried to bite him again. He went to the
hotel, and with a farmhand returned to
the stable and found the horse frothing at
the mouth and tugging at its halter. He
at once sot a rifle and shot the mad beast.
Lyon says that about four months ago
the horse was bitten by a dog on one of its
hind legs, but he thought little of it at the
time. The wound was cauterized.

ON THE LAKE.
Failure of the First Race
for the International
Championship.
CANADA AND VENCEDOE
The American Boat Probably
Saved From a Dsfeat by
the Wind.
HANDICAPPED BY CONDITIONS.
Canadians Greatly Elated Over the
Showing Made by Their Fast
Sailer.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Aug. 24.â The attempt
to sail the first international race between
the Canada and Vencedor for the inter
lake yachting championship on Lake Erie,
off Toledo, resulted in a failure on account
of the lack of wind, as the regatta com
mittee declared the race off at 3 o'clock
this afternoon, after the yachts had drifted
about for four hours.
When the race was called, the Canada,
which had a lead of over a mile, had only
covered six miles, or about a quarter of
the course, and was half way between the
first and second marks on the first round.
The race was witnessed by a big crowd of
spectators, and nearly 100 steam and sail
ing craft followed the yachts over the
course. The Canadians were naturally
greatly elated over the showing of their
champion, while the American yachtsmen
were glum over the result.
As a matter of fact the original condi
tions have handicapped the Vencedor, so
that it will be little short of a miracle if
she wins in a light wind, though she will
undoubtedly do well in a blow. As it is
she is under-canvased and cannot do her
self justice.
The course to-day was a triangular one
of twelve miles, four miles to the leg,
and sailed over twice.
At 10:55 a gun was fired from the steam
yacht Sigma as a signal for the yachts to
get ready to start, and they slowly shifted
their positions to the windward end of the
line and began jockeying for the weather
berth. The Canada moved through the
water at quite a lively rate considering the
almost imperceptible wind that was blow
ing, while the Vencedor had hardly steer
age way. When the starting signal was
given at 11 o'clock both yachts hauled on
the wind on the starboard tack and headed
for the line. The Canada ran up the Ven
cedor weather quarter and set a big jib
topsail and balloon forestaysail, which, as
she forged ahead, blanketed the 'Chicago
boat and left her in the doldrums as she
went over the line.
It was some time before the Vencedor
felt the wind again, but in the meantime
she ran up a small jib topsail and began
to gather headway and crossed the line
with little more than steerage way on her.
The Canada came about on the port tack
at 11 :23 o'clock and stood across the Ven
cedor's bows, again taking the wind
out of her sails, and just as she began to
fill again she found the Canada had gone
about and was on her weather quarter
and in a short time had cleared and was
well to windward and gone to the west
ward hunting wind.
At 11:40 o'clock the Vencedor went
about on the port tack in such a light air
that she was forty seconds in stays and
then stood well to the north, where it
looked as though there might be a breeze.
In all this time the yachts had not sailed a
quarter of a mile. Each held on and at
11 :40 o'clock the Canada came about on
the port tick and stood after the Ven
cedor.
At 11:55 the wind shifted to the east of
north and came out with enough strength
for the first time to nil the sails, and then
the yachts were able to lay their course on
the starboard tack for the stakeboat, with
the wind abeam. The Canada then, with
her bigger proportionate sail area, began
to draw rapidly away from the Vencedor,
which simply drifted along, and by the
time the Canada turned the mark, at
1:13:40, she was a mile in the lead. As
soon as the Canada turned and stood off
on the starboard tack the Vencedor's
spinnaker was set to starboard, but it did
her no good, as there was not enough wind
to fill it and it blanketed her head sails.
At 1:40 she rounded the stakeboat and
headed after the Canada, which slowly con
tinued to draw away, till at 3 o'clock the
wind dropped to a flat calm, and a few
minutes later the regatta committee de
clared the race off for the day, as it was
impossible to finish it within tne required
five and a half hours' time limit. The
yachts will sail over the same course to
morrow.

CORBETT AND SHARKEY.
Pugilistic Managers Meet and Discuss
the Coming Con
test.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 24.â D. J.
Lynch, representing Tom Sharkey, San
Francisco's "Sailor Boy" pugilist, and
Samuel Thall, Jim Oorbett's representa
tive, met at the office of the Police Gazette
to-night to fix a time and place and con
eider propositions for the Corbett-Sharkey
fight. Corbett was called to Baltimore on
business.
His representative said that Corbett de
sired to have inserted in the articles of
agreement a clause providing that the
winner of the contest should be awarded
the Police Gazette championship-of-the
world belt, which Corbett claims by ri>;ht
"of forfeit from Fitzsimmons. This was
agreeable to Mr. Lynch, and the articles
were ordered changed accordingly.
W. H. Wheelock, on behalf of Dan
Stuart, said he was ready to guarantee to
pull off the fight at a place which would
be free from police interference.
Mr. Stuart said he had not yet decided
what purse he would offer for the fight.
Mr. Lynch said the National Sporting
Club of San Francisco had made a stand
ing offer of $20,000 for the fight, but Mr.
Wbeelock said Mr. Stuart would make no
such offer.
It was finally decided to adjourn the
meeting until next Thursday, when it is
expected Corbett and SharKey will be pres
ent. Mr. Stuart will then name the figure
he is willing to give for the fight.
TnÂ» articles of agreement lor the fight
were signed in San Francisco on June 26,
and call for a meeting of the two men
within six months.
The contest will be for $20,000, of which
sum $5000 has already been Dosted. On
September 1 an additional $5000 will be
put up and the balance is to be handed to
the stakeholder one week before the daie
decided upon for the fight.
Mr. Lynch said Sharkey was ready to
meet Corbett on four weeks' notice. He
is at present at Mount Clemens, Mich.,
and is said to be in excellent condition.
It is announced by Mr. Thall that Mr.
Brady had retired from the management
of Mr. Corbett's pugilistic affairs and that
Mr. Corbett would hereafter attend to
these matters himself.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 1896.
D. R. FRANCIS TO
SUCCEED SMITH,
Missouri's Ex-Governor Is
Chosen Secretary of
the Interior.
FAVORED BY CLEVELAND
Fidelity of the Politician of the
Corn State Is Suitably
Rewarded.
HAS LONG HELD FULL SWAT.
With a Rod of Iron the Western
Statesman Dictated All the
Fat Appointments.
â¢
BUZZARDS BAY, Mass., Aug. 24.â
President Cleveland announced to-night
thai David R. Francis, ex-Governor of
Missouri, had been appointed Secretary of
the Interior, vice Hoke Smith, resigned,
and that he will assume the duties of his
office September 1.
WASHINGTON. D. 01, Aug. 24.â Ex-
Governor Francis has pot let the^ grass
grow under his feet. On Saturday, when
the news of Secretary Smith's resignation
became public, Mr. Francis dropped into
town quietly and spent the afternoon
with Secretary Carlisle at the Treasury
Department. Yesterday morning he spent
with the Secretary at his residence on X
street, and yesterday afternoon departed
as quietly and mysteriously as he had
arrived. Mr. Francis is a Cleveland man,
alter the President's own heart, and has
shared the fate of all other Cleveland men.
When "Dave" Francis defeated old
â¢'Garden Sass" Cockrell for the guberna
torial nomination in Missouri years ago he
was regarded as the coming man in Mis
souri politics. For awhile he d ctated
politics absolutely. Then he joined the
Cleveland camp and became the Presi
dent's "grand almoner" of all the Federal
patronage in Missouri, and to-day it is
doubted if Mr. Francis could rally 5000
votes out of the hundreds of thousands of
I Democratic voters in Missouri.
Mr. Cleveland's admiration for Francis
was without limit. Every appointment
that he made in Missouri was dictated by
Francis. He absolutely ignored Senators
Cockrell and Vest and in the case of the
latter carried this disregard of Senatorial
prerogative to open contempt. At the re
quest of Francis President Cleveland ap
pointed Samuel Priest Federal Judge lor
the Eastern District of Missouri.
Mr. Priest was an excellent lawyer, but
he had been for years Mr. Gould's at
torney for the Missouri Pacific Railroad,
and his appointment was very unpopular.
Mr. Cleveland paid no heed to the pro
test, but Mr. Priest, after a few months'
service, retired from his' position. He
wrote out his resignation, but instead of
forwarding it to the President he handed
it to Mr. Francis. Francis placed the
resignation in his pocket, came on to
Washington, saw the President, and in
half an hour's interview had Priest's
resignation accepted and the appoint
ment of George Adams, a personal friend,
made out. Senator Vest of Missouri had
been for twelve years a member of the
Judiciary Committee. As Senator from
Missouri and as a member of that com
mittee which passes upon qualifications
of Federal appointments, he had a right
to demand that he be consulted; but Mr.
Vest's first knowledge of Mr. Priest's
resignation was when he read in the after
noon paper that his successor, Mr. Adams,
had been appointed.
When Postmaster-General Bissell an
nounced his determination to retire from
the Cabinet President Cleveland had se
lected ex-Governor Francis as his succes
sor, and he intended to send Wilson to
Mexico to succeed the late Governor Gray
of Indiana. Mr. Wilson wanted the place,
and said so very frankly. Consequently,
when at the last moment President Cleve
land, for reasons which it is not necessary
to enter into at this moment, changed his
plans and named Senator Ransom of North
Carolina for the Mexican mission, Wilson
was indignant, and be placed no limits on
the passionate language in which he de
nounced the "chief of the Muscovy
drakes," as he dubbed Mr. Ransom, who
had robbed him of the coveted post. So
great was the outcry of protest raised by
Wilson's friends that President Cleveland
was reluctantly compelled to shelve Fran
cis and give the postmaster-generalship to
Wilson. Francis accepted the situation
very gracefully and now has his reward.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Aug. 24.â David Row
land Francis was born of Scotch Irish
parents in Richmond, Ky., Octobtr 1,
1050. Supplementing his common school
education in Kentucky, he graduated
from Washington University in this city
in 1880, with the degree of bachelor of
arts. After three years' apprenticeship in
commercial life, he organized the D. R.
Francis & Bro. Commission Company
which is still one of the leading firms op
erating at the Merchants' Exchange. In
1883 he was elected vice-president of the
exchange and then chosen president. He
has been a life-long Democrat and in 1884
was a delegate to the convention that
nominated Mr. Cleveland for President.
The following year he was elected Mayor
of St. Louis by 1400 majority, overcoming
a former Republican majority of 14,000.
Long -needed municipal reform flourished
under his administration. In 1888 he was
elected Governor of Missouri by one of the
heaviest majorities ever achieved by his
party in Missouri, and his wise conduct of
the office is still a criterion. Prior to the
Chicago convention of this year he was
very prominent in the ranks of the sound
money Democrats, and took a leading part
in the effort to beat back the rising of the
silver agitation. In 1886 Mr. Francis was
wedded to Miss Jennie Perry of St. Louis,
daughter of John Perry, president of the
Laclede National Bank. Six boys were
born of this union.
A TRAMP PRINTER'S LUCK.
Meets His Brother, a Los Angeles Mil-
lionaire, Whom He Long Sup
posed Was Dead.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 24.â Edward T.
Doheny, the millionaire oil king of Los
Angeles, Cal., came to Chicago to-day to
look for bis brother, Thomas C. Doheny,
whom he had not seen in twenty-four
years. He found him last night in a
saloon on Van Buren street, destitute, poor
and out of employment.
The meeting was a pathetic one, for
Thomas had supposed his brother dead.
When Richard L. Doheny left home his
father and mother and two brothers and
a sister were living. All of them died ex
cept his elder brother, Thomas, who had
drifted to Chicago and followed his trade
as a printer.
Desiring to see his brother Mr. Doheny
came to Chicago and applied at the Cen
tral station for assistance. Detectives
were detailed on the case and they located
the missing brother in a saloon. His
clothes were ragged, bis shoes torn and his
hair long and shaggy.
When Detective Burke stepped up to
him and asked him if he had any rela
tives, the old printer said he had a
brother, but he thought he had died
years ago. When Burke told Doheny
his brother was waiting to see him in
McCoy's Hotel across the street, the man
almost leaped in the air with delight. The
two brothers were brought face to face
and wept in each other's arms with joy.
The millionaire oil king took his brother
to a barber-shop, where he was given the
full benefit of a tonsorial artist's laboxs.
Then he enjoyed a bath.
A fashionable haberdasher furnished the
best of wearing apparel and a clothier a
brand new suit of clothes. A dinner at
the Auditorium was enjoyed by the
brothers, and then both retired to their
rooms in the Annex.
STAGE ROBBERS KILL A WOMAN.
She Pluckily Refused to Give Up Her
Valuables and Was Shot Dead by
a Bandit,
GUTHRIE, O. T., Aug. 24.â The stage
coach between Grande and Arapahoe, in
Day County, was held, up by four high
waymen early this morning and the iour
occupants were ordered to stand and de
liver.
Mrs. Amy Childs of Philadelphia refused
to dismount and was shot dead. The
highwaymen were undoubtedly Bill Doolin
and his three pals.
Doolin escaped from the United States
Jail in this city six weeks aj?o by sawing
through the bars and overpowering the
guards.
The hold-up took place near a clump of
woods and near a ravine where the rob
bers had hid themselves. One grabbed the
horses, another covered the driver, while
the other two walked rapidly to the stase
and jerked open the door and demanded
from the passengers their cash.
The three men, Berry, Richards and
Stein or Stern complied. Mrs. Child in
dignantly cried: "You are dirty cowards,
and you'll have to kill me to get my
money."
While one robber received the valua
bles of the three frightened men the other
robber parleyed a few moments with the
woman, then deliberately raising his gun
he fired upon her.
A few seconds later the outlaws were
scurrying through the ravine, where they
mounted horses and fled. Several posses
have been organized and are pursuing the
highwaymen.
The three passengers in the stage with
Mrs. Childs were cattlemen. All were
armed at the time of the attack, but were
bo suddenly confronted that resistance was
futile. The robbers secured $760 in money
and two watches.
PYTHIANS AT CLEVELAND
The Forest City Entirely in the
Hands of the National
Conclave.
Gorgeous Pageants Precede Business
Sessions Which Promise to Be
of Great Interest.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 26.-^-The
Forest City, the Pythian banner city of
Ohio, which Is the banner State of the or
der, has been given over completely to the
Knights of Pythias for the National Con
clave. Blue, orange and red, the tri
colored standard of the Uniform Rank, is
everywhere, and the scarlet flag, with the
white lily emblazoned, waves from every
housetop and flagpole. The "Payne Pas
tures," comprising a tract of fifty acres in
the heart of the city, is a white city of
2000 tents. It is called Camp Perry Payne.
Eight thousand uniformed Knights are
here, and it is said that 20,000 men will
line up in the great parade to-morrow-
Most Worthy and Illustrious Prince of
the Universe John A. Hinsay of Chicago
and his sacred dromedary of the Knights
of Korassan were much in evidence to
day. He was escorted through the streets
by 500 Knights in glittering Arabic cos
tumes.
Nothing of moment was transacted at
the morning session. The order was in
creased from 1500 to 9000 since last De
cember.
The action of the Knights of Pythias
convention, which opens to-morrow, with
recard to the German ritual is awaited with
great interest by the Knights assembled.
Charges will be preferred against the
chancellors of three lodges that use the
German ritual in violation of the rules
laid down by the Supreme Lodge some
time ago. The bulk of opinion sustains
the Supreme Lodge.
Past Chancellor A. R. Wood of Kansas
City said: "The matter has been settled
for good. It will certainly come up at the
meeting of the Supreme Lodge, but 1 do
not favor any change. 1 do not think
any will be made, and the law forbidding
the printing of German rituals will stand."
Past Supreme Chancellor Goff of Rhode
Island said: "I favored a German ritual
when the matter was up before, but now
that it has been settled I think it ought to
remain so."
It is said that the German lodges will
fight hard, and some have threatened to
go to any extreme.
Gold Under the Floor.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 24.â Five
thousand dollars in gold coin was found
under the cellar floor of the cottage at
Flagtown, N. J., occupied by Mrs. Ninger,
wife of the celebrated counterfeiter, who is
now in Elmira penitentiary. The secret
service agents in their search explored
every nook and corner of the cottage. They
confiscated several thousand dollars in
bank notes and bonds, and it was be
lieved that Mrs. Ninger was leit almost
penniless.

VAN BUREN, Ark., Aug. 24.â While

verdict being excusable homicide. Wil
liams was a farmer, and leaves a large
family.

SANTA BARBARA
MISSION'S LOSS,
Death of Father Superior
Servatius Altmicks at
Los Angeles.
OLD IN SACRED WORE.
Though an Invalid, He Spent a
Lifetime Laboring for
Mankind.
CROSSED THE PLAINS IN 1858.
Father Bernardin, a Youthful Priest,
Named as the Dead Man's
Successor.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Aug. 24â
This year will be a memorable one of sor
row and tragedy in the annals of the old
mission of Santa Barbara. Scarcely has
the shadow of the awful crime by which
the venerable Father Ferdinand Berg
meyer, the beloved father superior, lost
his life last spring begun to lift from the
venerable pile when the news comes of
the death of his successor, Father Ser
vatins Altmicks, who passed away at
noon yesterday in the house of the Fran
ciscan fathers in Los Angeles, whither he
went a week or two ago in failing health.
Father Servatius was one of the first
members of the German Province of the
Sacred Heart to emigrate to this country,
reaching here in 1858 and joining in the
organization of the central house of the
order of St. Louis. He was 67 years old
and had spent forty-five years in the
order, forty-two in the priesthood. He
was a very pious and self-abnegating man,
and served the church and his people
faithfully all these years, although he
may be said to have been a lifelong
invalid, having suffered for more
than forty years from a severe
rupture. He filled many important posi
tions in the order and upon the death of
Father Bergmeyer was selected to act as
father superior of the Santa Barbara mis
sion, pending the appointment of a regu
lar successor to the murdered priest. This
appointment was recently made by the
St. Louis house in the person of Father
Bernardin, a youthful, gifted and zealous
man, who assumed his high office two
weeks ago.
The news of the death of Father Serva
tius comes as a shock to all of the mem
bers of his order here and there are fears
that its effect will prove fatal to the ven
erable Father Fox, the oldest member of
the order on this coast, who has, since the
murder of Father Ferdinand, been lying
mortally ill at the mission. A strong feel
ing of personal attachment unites these
aged priests who have so long labored to
gether in warm comradeship in their sa
cred cause.
The dead priest's body was brought to
Santa Barbara on the noon train to-day,
and on Wednesday morning at 9 o'clock
funeral services will be conducted by the
Order of St. Francis. His body will be
placed in the new tomb, beside Father
Bergmeyer's, in the churchyard attached
to the old mission.
WAR KEPT THEM APART.
Aged Sweethearts Meet and Marry After
Many Hears' Separation.
LOS ANGELES, "Cal.. Aug. 24.â Two
hearts, separated by the war, two hands,
torn apart by the struggle between the
North and the South, were reunited when
John L. Amlin of Anaheim signed his
name to the marriage register Saturday
morning. Long ago, before the war,
John Die Amlin, son of a well-to-do Illi
nois farmer, loved a little girl named
Sallie. They waded in the brooks and
pulled the wild honeysuckle togtther, and
though of tender years and unconscious of
the sanctity of the vows, they pledged to
each other their mutual love.
The war came and Johnnie marched
away with the soldiers with Sallies
father. The latter was killed and Johnnie,
after having known a Southern prison,
wandered far away from his school-girl
sweetheart. She, with her mother, gave
up the old farm, and leaving the prairie
S ate, left for the silver hills of Colorado.
There a rough but kindly miner saw and
loved Sallie. The miner, named tham
berlin, died, and Sallie, now aged 58, came
to Los Angeles.
Vlither John Amlin came many years
ago and recently the two met. Though he
is 60 and she but two years his junior,
they secured a license at the clerk's office
and were married.

Tacoma's Fighting Ex- Official.
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 24. â Ex-Com
missioner of Public Works Doherty to-day
made a record for himself as a pugilist.
He keeps a barber-shop on Pacific avenue.
To-day he got very wrathy when it came
to his ears that one of his barbers, named
Jones, bad been insinuating that he knew
considerable about the recent ballot theft.
Doherty confronted Jones with this charge
this morning, and then proceeded to
thrash him soundly. He did this up so
thoroughly that Jones' face was scarcely
recognizable when he was thrown out of
the shop. Ten minutes later he went to a
drugstore and was patched up. A police
man who is friendly to Doherty witnessed
the affair, but made no interference.

Happenings of Interest at the Mare
Island Station.
VALLEJO. Cal., Aug. 24.â The Petrel
will be the first c! the several ships un
dergoing repairs at the Mare Island navy
yard to be completed. In two or three
weeks the ensign and pennant will again
fly, denoting her being in commission.
The Thetis remains at the yard, though
in due time she will return South, where
her officers will resume duty.
There is but little new work being car
ried on at present outside of boats for
various ships, the great part of work be
ing that of repair to the cruisers and the
Hartford.
The ship- joiners who recently made ap
plication for an increase of pay have had
their request denied by the department.
Congressman Hilboru is of the opinion
that the next Congress will pass an appro
priation for the building of an additional
drydock at Mare Island. If so It will be
the means of giving employment to many
additional men, and will allow battle-ships
of the Oregon's class to go there for docK
age.
Opening of proposals for constructing
the quay wall near thecoalsheds have been
postponed for a few days. There is still a
possibility that the work may be done by
the navyyard workmen, and without
doubt they would do better work than the
contractors, no matter how closely the
work is looked after.
The cote for the homing pigeons to be
kept at the yard is well under way. About
one hundred Dirds are to be sent out from
the East to be distributed to the various
ships in the Pacific fleet.

JOHNSON IS FOR SILVER.
Will Stand Upon His Record in Behalf
of the While Metal.
STOCKTON. Cal., Aug. 24.âRepresent
ative Grove L. Jonnson was in this city to
day. When spoken to regarding his stand
on the silver question he said :
"My record shows how 1 stand for silver.
I have always spoken for it and voted for

Republican caucuses on the silver ques
tion, if such should be held, he said :
"Oh, no; lam a Republican. Just wait
until I make my speech here during the

DEL MONTE, Cal., Aug. 24.â Bad be
ginning, good ending," is a saying said to
be as true as it is old. Thereiore, the lat
ter part of the Burlingame Club's week of
sport at Del Monte will surely be a sur
passing success. The beginning is in the
nature of a disappointment. In the first
place, although there are about 300 people
here, the attendance is not as great as was
expected. Twice as many as are here now
are, however, due on or before Thursday.
Then things have gone wrong with the
polo game scheduled for to-morrow.
Owing to the non-arrival of several of the
players, the game has been declared oft.
Mr. Walter S. HoOart, Mr. Charles O.
Baldwin, Mr. John Lawson, Captain
Wainewright and Mr. Richard Tobiu are
here, but that is all.
There are very few of the Country Club
members here and few are expected. Mr.
and Mrs. Walter 8. Hobart and party ana
the Misses Tobin and Edwin Tobin came
down by the afternoon liver. In the Ho
bart part were Miss Juliette Williams and
her pretty cousin, Miss Rodgers. Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Baldwin met the party on
their arrival. Miss Juliette Williams is
the reigning belle at the hotel. At dinner
this evening she was the observed of all
observers. Mrs. Hobart is not enjoying
the best of health, and after the fatigue of
the journey was obliged to retire to her
apartments.
Miss Beatrice Tobin, one of the buds of
last year, has blossomed into a glorious
rose. A wealth of hair, the color that
Titian loved to paint, frames afresh young
face and half conceals a tiny ear. She
dresses with exquisite taste, and like her
sister, Miss Celia Tobin, carries herself
with queenly grace. Mrs. Crocker Alex
ander has so far displayed several elabo
rate and "stunning" toilets. A dinner
gown she wore this evening was of delicate
canary moire antique. The corsage was
studded with scottea nails and a scroll
pattern of jet ornamented the front of the
full modish jupe.
Mrs Phoeoe Hearst has arranged a pic
nic for to-morrow. About twenty-five
young people will accompany her and a
most delightful time is anticipated.
About twenty vehicles of different de
scriptions belonging to Walter S. Hobart
arrived to-day. Traps and drags of all sorts
were represented. His coach for the coach
ing parade was also there. Besides the
Hobart coach the Burlingame Club coach
and that of Charles O. Baldwin are also
here.

DOUBLE TRAGEDY
AT SAN PEDRO,
R. C. Johnson Kills Mrs.
teda Lane and Then
Himself.
CRIME COOLLY PLANNED
Intent on Murder, He Meets the
Woman at a Ferry
Landing.
FIRES AS SHE STEF3 ASHORE.
The Victim His Former Wife, Who
Was Divorced Three Months
Ago.
Los Angeles Officx or The Call, )
328 South Broadway. V
Los Angeles, Cal., Auj. 24, )
Mrs. Leda Lane, wife of Harry Lane,
assistant foreman of the Southern Cali
fornia Lumber Company, was shot at San
Pedro this morning by her former hus
band, R. C. Johnson, who then put two
bullets into his own head. The affair oc
curred at the Duffy ferry landing on the
east side of the railroad wharf.
Mrs. Lane left her home on Terminal
Island at 8 o'clock to go to San Pedro.
She had just stepped on to the wharf
when her former husband, who was lying
in wait for her, stepped up, and, seizing
her by the arms, asked :
"When are you going to give that $200
you promised me?"
She replied: "Wait a spell; I will give it
to you as soon as I can get it"
She had barely finished speaking when
Johnson drew a revolver and fired, the
bullet passing through her arm below the
elbow, entering the chest and piercing the
lower portion of the heart The woman
fell backward into the water. Rescuers
hastened to her aid and drew her on to
the wharf.
Two more shots rang out and the
horror-stricken spectators turned from the
body of the woman to see Johnson fall,
with the blood streaming from two
wounds in bis head. He bad shot him
self in the right temple and again behind
the ear.
Johnson's victim was dead when she
was laid on the wharf. He lingered until
11 o'clock.
About three months ago Mrs. Lane was
granted a divorce from Johnson on the
ground of cruelty. At- the time the
divorfce was granted Johnson, who was a
ship steward by occupation, was absent on
a voyage. He returned six weeks ago,
since which time he has been pursuing
his former wife, claiming that she
promised him $200 if he would not fight
the divorce proceedings.
About a month ago she married Harry
Lane, with whom she lived happily.
Johnson had repeatedly threatened bis
former wife, and evidently had been pre
meditating to-day's crime, for shortly be
fore the arrival of Duffy's ferry-boat John
son walked into Joe Meldt's store and
there purchased cartridges, with which he
loaded his revolver. From the store,
which faces the harbor, Johnson walked
over to the ferry landing and there awaited
the arrival of his victim.
Johnson had resided in San Pedro about
two years and had repeatedly beaten his
wife. He was not liked. On the other
hand his former wif* was beloved by all
who knew her, and the residents of San
Pedro and Terminal Island were pleased
when the ties that bound her. to Johnson
were broken. Mrs. Lane, who was about
26 years of age, has a mother in this city.
Johnson was about 30 years of age.

First Brigade, N. G. C, yesterday, and a
practical demonstration given of the ex
cellent progress made by this branch of
the National Guard. After five previous
attempts the Signal Corps succeeded in
signaling between the top of Black Jack
Peak, Catalina Island, and Mount Wilson.
Corporal Washburn and Private Swisher
were on Black Jack and Lieutenant Law
rence, with thirteen members of the corps,
were on Mount Wilson, having gone up
the old trails Saturday evening. At 1:10
o'clock the squad on Mount Wilson caught
the return flash from Black Jack, and sev
eral messages were sent and received, the
last one reading:
"Over one stretch of seventy-three mijes
of land and sea the signal corps Bends
greeting to the people of Los Angeles."
This success of the signal corps breaks
the State record for distance and the
world's record for signaling over water,
and the boys are being made the recipients
of much-deserved praise for their skill.
HIS TREES ARE PRESERVED.
Armed With a Shotgun, W. XileM Defies
a Street Superintendent.
LOS ANGELEB, Cal., Aug. 24.â"Coun
cil, spare those trees," has been the plea
of W. Niles for some time past. So
earnest was his desire to save a couple of
historical wajnut trees on Maple avenue
that he camped under them with a shot
gun and prevented the Street Superin
tendent from fulfilling the specifications
for the new curb.
The Council acted on the much-post
poned acceptance of the Maple-avenue
street improvement this morning. The
curb was built, not in accordance with
specifications, to save those two wainut
trees. Niies, the owner 'of the trees, had
remained on the curb with a shotgun, and
said a three-foot curb would have to do ii
an eight-foot radius interfered with the
trees. Councilman Munson admitted that
under these painful circumstances one
would not want to interfere, and the
Council finally denied the protests.
LOS ANGELES ACCIDENT.
A Whteltcoman Thrown Before a Moving
Electric- Car.
LOS ANGELES.CaI., Aug. 24.â Through
the carelessness of a young man, Mrs.
Emma Tilton was knocked from her bi
cycle yesterday, fell in front of an
electric-car and was terribly cut and
bruised.
She was riding close to the track, and
when near the corner of Main and Com
mercial streets a car approached rapidly
from the north. A man started from the
sidewalk to board the car, and in his
haste paid no attention to Mrs. Tilton.
He collided with her and knocked her
directly in front of the trucks. She was
rolled along some distance before the car
was stopped. Her nose was broken and
her scalp badly cut, twenty-six stitches
being necessary to close the gash. She
received severe bruises about the body.
The man gave his name as J. F. Mc-
Donald.
He Hates Li Bung Chang.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 24. â Li
Huns Chang, the distinguished Chinese
Viceroy, has at least one enemy in this
city and he has threatened the life of the
official. This enemy is Wong Gok, one of
the wealthiest of Chinatown merchants.
This morning he was asked about the visit
of Li. Gok said that Chang never gave
men anything to do and that he lived like
a poor man and did all his own work. He
then remarked: "I'd like to see him dead
long time. No good. Kill him if he comes
here."

SAN BERNARDINO TAXES.
Assessor Kendall's Methods Investigated
by Equalizersâ San Diego County's
Assessment.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 24.â San
Bernardino County was given a hearing
before the Board of Equalization this
morning. Assessor A. G. Kendall and
several citizens appeared as its representa
tives. The investigation was confined for
the most part to efforts to determine the
method of assessment used by Assessor
Kendall. .
Kendall's assessment roll shows a slight
increase, but a material reduction in city
property. This necessitated an increase
in country property. In answer to a ques
tion by Beamer the assessor stated that
the highest assessment of city real prop
erty was the Stewart block, in Ban Bernar
dino, on which there was a valuation of
$125 a front foot. Beamer called attention
to the fact as a comparison that the high
est assessment in Santa Rosa was $275 a
front foot. In reply Kendall said that the
owners would be glad to part with the
Stewart real property at his valuation.
Orange groves are assessed as high as
$260 per acre, while the highest last year
was $200 on the same property. This
makes up for a decrease of 10 per cent on
personal property throughout the county,
$29,000 in San Bernardino and $18,000 in
Redlands. Kendall stated that in one ap
plioation for reduction before the Board
of Supervisors a reduction of $250 on $1300
was granted.
Arnold took Assessor Kendall to task
for the difference between his and the
Bank Commissioner's returns of San Ber
nardino County banks. Kendall stated
that the difference was not material be
cause it could not be told whether the
credits returned by the B.ank Commission
ers were really solvent or not
Reed of San Diego County appeared be
fore the board at the afternoon session
and made an excellent showing for a re
duction in the assessment roll of that
county. Last year the board granted alO
per cent reduction and this year the
county was assessed at fully as high a
figure as it had been before the board had
granted the reduction. Reed proved that
each aore of land within the confines of
tne county, including thousands of acres
of desert, was assessed at over $5.
MISSING FROM SAN JOSE,
Harry Bell, Manager of Poheim's
Tailoring Establishment,
Disappears.
Believed to Have Wandered Away
While Temporarily Insane
From Worry.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 24.â Harry Bell,
who has been manager of Poheim's tailor
ing establishment in this city for some
time, has suddenly disappeared. After
breakfast Saturday morning he left his
home near Fifth and Washington streets,
and since that tima has not been seen.
He had been in poor health for sometime,
and tie fact that Poheim was closing his
store here is believed to have preyed upon
his mind until he became slightly de
mented and wandered away. He had
been offered a position in Poheim's store
in San Francisco, but he expressed regret
at being obliged to leave this city and go
among strangers. He has a wife and two
children in this city.
Bell was not in the habit of reaching the
store before 8 o'clock in the morning, but
as the goods were being packed for ship
ment to San Francisco he left home a
little before 7 o'clock Saturday morning
to close up the firm's accounts here, but
as Bell did not show up the safe could not
be opened. This morning the safe was
broken open by a locksmith. No money
was found in the safe, but it is not be
lieved Bell is short in bis accounts. Po
heim's system of conducting bis branch
stores is such that daily reports and weekly
returns are made, and if there is a
shortage it could be but a few dollars.
Bell has been in Poheim's employ as an
expert cutter for many years, having been
in the stores at Fresno, Los Angeles and
San Francisco.
DISEASED COWS BOLD.
Dairymen to Be Prosecuted for Violating
the Laic.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 24.â Veterinary
Inspector Spencer to-day began a prosecu
tion of Mrs. B. Sullivan and D. G. Sullivan,
proprietors of a dairy on the King road,
near Alum Rock avenue, for Belling nine
cows suffering from tuberculosis. Some
time ago the inspectors condemned the
cows in question, and theSullivans signed
an agreement to deliver the cows to the
inspector for slaughter. The cows were
never delivered, and when Dr. Spencer
sent a man after them he was told that
the stock had been sold before the inspec
tion and that the owner had taken them
away. The inspector cannot learn who
bought the cows or where they were taken
to, but the supposition is that they were
disposed of to butchers and the diseased
meat sold throughout the county.
The offense is punishable by a fine of
$300 or 100 days' imprisonment in the
County Jail.
FEATURES OF THE PAIR.

MILITARY LIFE
IN CAMP O'RYAN,
Gien Ellen Supplies Varied
Entertainment for
1 the Cadets.
PURSUIT OF A DESERTER
Private Cole Breaks Through
the Lines Twice; Going
and Coming.
DISCIPLINED FOR HIS OFFENSE.
Strange Disappearance of Sergeant
Ohlsen's Clothing as He Disports
in the Water.
GLEN ELLEN, Cal., Aug. 24.-Life in
Camp O'Ryan has so far proved to be one
succession of delights. The cadets of the
League of the Cross have said so more
than once to-day, and they certainly know
what they are talking about when it cornea
to a discussion of bow boys are best
pleased with a country outing. In the
camp and out of it the cadets are having
more fun than they bargained for on leav
ing San Francisco; and yet, with all their
jollification and disregard of conventional
restraints, they are conducting themselves
so bravely and so well that Captain Fil
gate, their military commander, is proud
of them, and the people of Glen Ellen are
glad to have the boys here for a week.
Sunday night passed off very quietly,
with the exception of an exciting chase
for a refractory cadet. Private Cole of
Company C was detailed for guard duty,
but no sooner had the detail been an
nounced than he ran the picket line and
escaped in the darkneas. The provost
sergeant and a squad were sent in pursuit.
They followed the retreating figure under
the deep shadows of trees, over barbed
wire fences, with which the country abont
here abounds, through the sleeping town,
and though the fugitive was the best run
ner a glimpse of him wns caught on the
Southern Pacific Railway. Then the chase
took a new course over the rails and ties,
with Private Cole visible in the moon
light Presently he dropped out of sight,
quick as a flash, and his pursuers thought
he had fallen and hurt himself. When,
however, they reached the spot where Cole
disappeared the squad found a trestlu
nearly fifty feet high.
"He's fallen through and killed him*
self I" the sergeant exclaimed, for not a
sign of the fugitive was left. The squad
scrambled down the banks to explore the
ground below for their comrade. But
again they were baffled until one happened
to look upward. To their intense surprise
and relief of mind they found him hang
ing from a stringer of the trestle by his
hands. They soon had him under arrest,
and just as quickly he escaped again.
The night became cold and lonesome
and Private Cole longed for the campfire
where his comrades were amusing them
selves. He broke the sentry line and got
safely into camp, where the guard de
tected him disguised with a blanket and
paint as a "Mission Indian."
Cole was put on guard duty until the
assistant surgeon pronounced him sick.
Then they gave him a little medicine,
which the surgeon explained: "It will
make him sick if he is well and well if be
is sick." As be got well it proved he was
not shamming, and now he's policing the
company's streets and bestowing the ten
der solicitude of a sentry on the camp.
After breakfast this morning the cadets
were put through a long series of drills
and sword exercises. It was noticed par
ticularly that their* step was firmer and
their lines much better preserved over the
uneven ground than when they first
marched into camp. They stood the
heavy drill like veterans and showed in
their sword exercises a proficiency which
would be expected only from trained sol
diers. This cystem of drilling and exer
cising is on the latest and most approved
plan of calisthenics and is calculated to
tend toward the symmetrical development
of the boys.
Although the morning sun was hot the
drill did not fatigue the boys, for hardly
hau they broke ranks and doffed their
white duck uniforms than they were off
to the swimming pool in the creek. This
ample strip of water nas become a popular
spot and the young warriors enjoy it to
their hearts' content Its depth is not
such as might cause any fears for their
safety, so the boys who have not learned
to swim are allowed to paddle with the
rest.
Sergeant Oscar Ohlsen of Company H
went in for a swim. The water was warm
and altogether delightful, and as he fairly
reveled in its comfortable depth he paidjno
attention to his comrades on the bank.
But when Sergeant Ohlsen came out of the
pool he was amazed to find his uniform
and all the rest of his dress missing.
None of the cadets saw his clothes, and
certainly none of them nad the garments,
so the sergeant was compelled to appear
in the fashions of the garden of Eden, and
suffered himself to be drummed through
camp into the guardhouse in improvised
skirts of green bunting.
The camp will be under command of the
following officers during the night: Officer
of the day. Captain J. F. Curley of Com
pany B; officer of the guard, Lieutenant
C. J. Regan of Company C; sergeant of
the guard, Sergeant E. O'Connor of Com
pany B; corporal of the guard, Corporal
H. Smith of Company C; members of the
guardâ J. Brady, J. O'Brien, R. Garetv,
C. Cole, Company C; R. O'Neil, J.
O'Leary, J. Hurley, W. Terry, L. Nolan,
Company B; J. Enright, J. Sullivan, W.

Number.
Six Converts Added to the Member
ship of St Bernard's Catholic
Church.
EUREKA, Cal., Aug. 24.â Bftuop Grace
of Sacramento administered the sacra
ment of confirmation to nearly 100 young
people in St. Bernard's Catholic Church
yesterday. Six converts also received the
sacrament at the same time, three of them
being hoary-headed men who have de
cided to adopt the guidance of the Catholic
faith during their few remaining days.
The ceremonies were witnessed by over
1500 people, who filled St. Bernard's
Church to its utmost capacity.
The church presented a magnificent ap
pearance, having lately been frescoed and
decorated by Frank Bernan, the Germun
decorator, who has made a life study of
such work. The music was Miliard's
popular mass, with orchestral accompani
meat, under the direction of Neil McMil*
lan of Eureka. Owing to the persistent
efforts of the organist, Miss Clara Dawson,
the music in fet. Bernard's Church com
pares very favorably with that in churches
of large cities, wtere there is abundance
of talent to select from. The soloists
were: Miss Sophia Buhne, Miss Ada Bell,
Mrs. W. F. Pratt and Frank Bacher.
In the evening this choir sang vespers,
and Bishop Grace, who was once pastor of
Eureka parish, preached a sermon to a
large congregation, taking for his theme,
"The Catholic Church." He treated the
subject in masterly style. Bishop Grace
manifests the sincerity and candor with
which he has begun his exalted duties.
Under ihe charge of Rev. L. Kennedy,
parish priest of Eureka, the congregation
of St. Bernard's Church has greatly in
creased, and Father Kennedy's sermons
are appreciated by non-Catholics as well
as Catholics.

OREGON SETTLER'S WOES
Sold Timber Instead of Burning
It and Must Go to
Prison.
His Wife and Children Left Without
Protection in Mountain
Wilds.
PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 24 â Garrett
Dixon, a hard-working settler who, in
clearing his 160-acre claim in the Blue
Mountains, committed the heinous crime
of converting some timber cut on his clear
ing into railroad ties for sale, instead of
setting fire to his slashing and seeing the
timber go up in smoke, was to-day taken
back to Pendletonby United States Deputy
Marshal Bsntley, where Dixon will serve
out a fine of $1000 in the Umatilla County
Jail. The prisoner is otherwise punished
by the seizure of hia ties, 1600 in number,
valued at close to $500, the result of six
months' hard work.
Dixon, who is a cripple, having lost half
of his left foot in a railroad accident, was
seen this afternoon just prior to his leav
ing with the Deputy Marshal to serve his
sentence. He said:
"Inasmuch as there is no use of com
plaining, the best thing I can do is to take
this wretched situation with as much
cheerfulness as I can command, but it is
going to be bard upon the women folks
while I am lying in jail. I have a wife
and family of six girls waiting up there
on the slopes of the Blue Mountains, deep
back in tne timber, without a neighbor
within eighteen miles, and what with the
cougars and bears it Is not over pleasant
for even an armed man after nightfall in
the timber. But they will be provided for
and protected some way. for 1 can't bring
myself to believe that I have wronged
either Government or individual in this
matter, while admitting that, through
misinformation, I violated the laws gov
erning the cutting of timber.
"I, a poor man, am going to prison for
the crime of cutting into ties a portion of
limber I have cut on a claim honestly
taken up, instead of having set fire to and
burned tne trees where they fell. Yet at
this moment there are sitting in their
elegant homes or the offices of their banks
men who have instigated and paid for the
cutting of hundreds of thousands of feet of
timber wnere I have cut one foot Not
only that, these men had never entered on
a single claim in the sections they have
culled."
To show Dixon's sense of honor, when
Bently first went to arrest the man the
prisoner was engaged on some work which
would suffer if its completion were de
layed. He therefore told the Deputy
Marshal that he would consider himself
under arrest and would appear at Pendle
ton in two days. Promptly on time he
was there.
Drowned at Portland.
PORTLAND, Ob., Aug. 24.â Charles
Carter, the nine-year-old son of Charles H.
Carter of 167 Grand avenue north, was

Mamie Griffin, the Fleet Chico
Mare, Vanquished in
the Trot.
HYMN COMES HOME IN FRONT.
The Three.Quarter Mile Dash Won
All the Way Around by
Hallelujah.
"WOODLAND, Cal.. Aug. 24.âWood
land's fifth annual fair and race meeting
opened auspiciously to-day. The weather
was warm, but not uncomfortably so. The
spectators might have enjoyed the sport
more if there had been a brisker breeze
from the south, but horsemen say the
weather was just right for good time. The
track was in fine condition for a first day.
It is probable that there is no faster track
in the State, and it is not improbable that
some records will be broken before the
week closes.
There was a good attendance. The
grand stand was comfortably filled, many
ladies being present. In the infield there
was a long line of carriages and buggies
and the betting ring was crowded. Hon.
J. P. McNair, T. S. Spaulding and L. B.
Adams occupied the judges' stand, and
Charles Hoppin, A. S. Shields and N. S.
Hall officiated as timers.
The first event on the card was the
three-in-five trot for the 2:20 class, in
which there were eight entries. Presiding
Judge McNair called the drivers before the
stand, gave them their numbers and ad
monished them that they would be
severely puished if any of them were de
tected in crooked wort. The crowd ap
plauded Mr. McNair's remarks.
The betting on the books and auction
pools was quite lively. The first auction
pool sold as follows: Mamie Griffin $15,
Laurel $15, field $6. Before the horses
started the odds changed, and Laurel sold
for $20, .Mamie Grilfin for $10 and the field
for $4. The horses were sent away at the
fourth attempt, with Laurel slightly in the
lead and Marata Griffin a length in the
rear. Laurel led to the half, followed by
Clay 8 and Charivari a length away, the
others well bunched, two lengths behind,
except Mamie Griffin. The fleet little
Chico beauty made two bad Dreaks down
the backstretcb, and lost all chance for
the race. The relative positions were re
tained to the wire, Laurel winning with
out an effort, Clay 8 second, Charivari
third. Time, 2:17^-
For the second heat the horses were
sent away on the third attempt, and the
start was an even one. At the quarter
Laurel was closely pressed by Mamie Grif
fin. The two trotted down the back
stretch like a double team, tne others
closely bunched two or three lengths
away. Half way round the upper turn
Laurel broke and lost four lengths, but
(juickly settled down to work and inch by
inch overhauled the leader. A hundred
yarda from the wire they were on even
terms. Then Laurel forgÂ«d to the front
uy a nead and held the advantage to the
wire. It was a close and exciting finish.
Clay 8 was third. Time, 2:l3}Â£.
Mamie Griffln won the third heat by a
nose from Laurel in 2:l6Ji, Anita finish
ing third. Laurel won the fourth in 2:14,
Mamie Griffin second, Clay 8 third.
In the selling race, half-mile and repeat,
for a purse of $250, there were eleven
starters. Blue Belle, the favorite, was
scratched on account of lameness. Starter
J. B. Ferguson made his first appearance
on the Woodland track, and the crowd
was pleaaed with his work. At the post,
Maud threw her rider (Snyder), ran down
the stretch, jumped the track gate and ran
into the stable. When she was brought
back she acted so badly that she was
finally sent to the stable. Hymn was such
a strong favorite that but few pools were
sold, and they were at odds of $10 for
Hymn, $6 for the field and $4 for Stormy.
Ferguson sent the horses away at tiie
first attempt. Stormy took the lead and
was never beaded. Hymn ran second, but
the judges made a mistake and the horse
was unplaced. George L was given second
place and Durango third. Time, :48^.
For the second heat only five horses
faced the starter. They ran well bunched
to the stretch, where Hymn beat Stormy
a half length after a hard drive. Tonino
was third. Time, :48>^.
Hymn was pronibiuve favorite when he
and Stormy came out for the final heat,
and he won handily. Time, :50, Tonino
got third money.
The three-quarters of a mile dash for
purse of $250 brought out seven starters.
Hallelujah sold favorite at $10, Howard S
$6 and the field $5. The horses were

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 24.-Presi

Council was arrested this evening at the
' conclusion of a meeting of the council. It

representatives who had congregated be
fore the hall in which the meeting was
The proceedings within the hall were
animated, and during the evening the
president rebuked B. Shields, who is em
ployed in the State printing office. At
the conclusion of the meeting, as l-ly
stepped on the sidewalk. Shields ac
costed him and requested to be informed
why he had taken such action.
Ely, it is said, whipped out a revolver
and fired point blank at him, the ball
striking Shields near the point of the
right shoulder, passing through and com
ing out at the back.
Shields closed with the excited man and
attempted to disarm him and in the
struggle Ely tired another shot, hitting
some unknown person in the leg. Then
the crowd closed in on Ely and before the
officers arrived he received a most un
merciful beating.
SAN DIEGO OFFERS REST,
Aged Pythians to Find Peace
and Plenty in the City
by the Sea.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 24.â Harry W.
Vincent of this city, secretary of the
Pythian Home committee of the State
Lodge, said to-day that the decision of
Judge Puterbaugh, restoring 100 acres of
the city park to the citjr, together with its
costly improvements, would certainly in
fluence the State Lodge toward securing
the grounds and buildings, or part of
them, for a World's Pythian Home for
aged and infirm members of the order.
The proposition, he says, is to secure a
deeJ in. trust from the city, through the
consent of the Legislature, contingent
upon the Knights of Pythias keeping the
houses and grounds in good condition.
The premises are ideal in every respect for
a home, being on the heights overlooking
the city. The building is a three-otbry
mansion, originally constructed for an or
phans' home by philanthropists who
failed to carry our their project, the prop
erty thereby reverting to the city.
"There is* $5000 in the State Lodge de
voted to this home," said Mr. Vincent,
"and much more will be received later.
This will be enough to put the buildings
and grounds in fine shape.
"The Pythians are enthusiastic over the
matter, and if they get the grounds will
establish a home that will be a pride to
the city and to every member of the order,
which is one of the strongest in Caliior
nia. I have received assurances from
members of the City Council that the city
will be glad to give a trust deed to such a
worthy object, upon the assurance that
the grounds will be keDt up. We can give
this assurance, so the proposition is prac
tically settled. The home will be open to
Knights of Pythias all over the world, but
will be under the direct supervision and
control of the State Lodge of California."
The buildings spoken of for the new
home were built in 1889 at a cost of $45,000,
and about $30,000 was expended on the
grounds, whicn were beautifully laid out
by an expert landscape gardener.

FIESTA OF TEMECULA.
Reservation Redskins Celebrate
the doming of a Full
Harvest.
The Easle Dance and Sundry Tests of
Endnrance Indulged In by
Old and Young.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Au<r. 24.â The Indian
fiesta at Temecula, in the northern end of
the county, began to-day. Hundreds of
Mexicans, Americans and representatives
of other nationalities are present from sur
roundina country and neighboring towns.
The weird scenes enacted by the aborig
ines are a source of the greatest curiosity
among the visitors, who are astounded at
the animation displayed by the usually
phlegmatic Indians of the Temecula Res
ervation.
The Indians have made great prepara
tions for the fiesta, and the burden of the
labor has fallen upon the faithful squaws,
who are decked out in brilliant calicoci
and when not otherwise engaged witness
the gyrations and feats of endurance of
their male companions with the greatest
admiration. Bucks who have been sup
posed to be near death'sydoor with con
sumption or other bodily infirmities have
exhibited amazing activity since the fiesta
began and enter into the contests as though
possessed of iron constitutions.
Two hundred young and old men took
part in the sports to-day and the first fea
ture that claimed their attention .was the
celebration of the feast of good crops.
Their manner of celebrating what among
civilized people would call for no unusual
outburst of physical activity astonished
the visitors in no small degree. While the
squaws droned and whined their thanks to
a wise providence for the bounteous har
vest, the males, in breech-cloth and feath
ers, danced and howled and gave vent to
demonstrations that indicated anything
but gratituae. But the feast was success
fully carried out, iv the opinion of the In
dians, and the whites were forced to con
cede that the celebration was not bad.
The most interesting feature of the day' 3
programme was the eagle dance, in which
a big eagle, measuring seven feet from tip
to tip, figured conspicuously. The eagle,
with bristling feattiers, was placed in the
center of the circle of howling young men,
and as each danced around to the chant
ing of the old men situated on the out
skirts of the circle, a feather was plucke<i
from the bird of freedom until it wa3
almost barren of raiment Then it was
seized by the neck by a big buck and
swung above his head until its life went
out. The squaws took the eagle at the end
of the dance and started to prepare it for
tno pot.
The war dance, with the Indians in full
paint and beside themselves with excite
ment, closed the festivities for the day.

TWO OBSTACLES IN THE WAY-
Joseph Keily Will Not Withdraw and
Monteith Defies the Railroad
Company.
John S. Dore, People's party National
Committeeman from California, while in
Invor of a straight Bryan and Watson
ticket so far as the fusion on Presidential
electors is concernel, is more than will
ir.K to fuse with the Democracy ou divid
ing the offices of Congressmen. He argues
ihat the People's party has nothing to
lose and something to gain by uniting
with the Democrats. Hence, he acted as
spokesman on behalf of the majority of i
the State Central Committee of which he â 
is a member, and proposed to the Demo
cratic State Executive Committee that the
ofiices of Congressmen should be divided j
between the two parties in the proportion I
of four Congressmen to the Democrats and i
three to the Pops'.lists.
As the Democracy had already broken
faith with the People's party State Con
vntion with reference to this matter,
and had nom.nate<l candidates in certain
districts strong in fopulistic votes, Mr. !
Dore suggested, presumably by way of re- i
lief, that ail tue candidates for Congress \
nominated by ooth parties should tender i
their resignations and allow their State
Central Committees to reappoint them or
their successors.
Thi? proposition was accepted with
avidity by the Democratic committee. I
Representatives or well-wishers of the !
Sout crn Pacific Company on that com
mittee were more than cleased, because it
would give tbsm an opportunity of turn- j
ing down George W. Monteith, the Peo- I
pie's party candidate from the First Con- â 
gressioual District. Mr. Monteith has
incurred the enmity of that powerful cor
poration because he defended the railroad i
strikers, and because ht sought to prose- j
cute Collis P. Huntington for issuing a
railroad pass to Frank M. Stone, the politi
cal manager of M. H. de Young.
It will also give them an opportunity of
pulling down Marion de Vries, Demo
cratic candidate in the second, and putting
up a weak Populist in his stead, in order
that the way to Congress might be made
clear for Grove L. Johnson.
The Democrats will take the Third Dis
trict under the new arrangement. Judge
Maguire will resign as candidate from the
Fourth District, and his resignation will j
be handed back to him immediately.
It is understood that Joseph Kelly will
refuÂ«e to retire in tbe Fifth and that
Colonel Taylor Rogers, the People's party
nominee, will also stand pat.
In the Sixth an effort will be made to
have Patton, the Democratic candidate, |
withdraw in order that a union may be I
effected on C. A. Barlow, the People's j
party oandidate.
In Die Seventh it is the intention to i
allow Mr. Castle, the Populist candidate, j
to remain on the ticket and not to put up
a Democrat against him.
George W. Monteith was asked yester
day afternoou by a Call reporter whether
he intended to resign as candidate in the
First.
"No, sir; I shall not resign. I never re- j
tire under tire. I will not withdraw," he
added with emphasis'. "The Fiiot Dis
trict nas the largest Populist vote i ropor
tionately in the State, and t.'ie Populists are j
entitled to that district. "
Chairman Butler of the People's party
National Committee has been asked aa to
me policy of the State Committee's fusing
with the Democracy on Presidential elec- i
tors, and he has replied that wherever au |
equitable arrangement should be made it
would be recosnized. In other words, I
wherever the People's party would be
allowed a number of Presidential electors
proportionate to its vote in any State, that
arrangement would be approved oi by the
National Committee.
But in States which, like Kansas and
Colorado, the Popluists had agreed to sup
port all the Bryan and Sewall electors in
exchange for State offices, sucn States j
sliould be cut off from the People's party, j
Joseph Asbury Johnson said yesterday !
that a remark made by him a few days a^o !
had been misunderstood. What he had !
said was that he would not vote for the I
four Bryan and Watson electors alone, !
because that would give Major McKinley |
five-ninths, or more than hall a vote. He J
ad dea:
"So I shall have to take my medicine i
and vote for all the fusion electors."
The State Executive Corninutee of the j
People's party went into session at 2 p. m. I
and resiained invisible until 8 o'clock.
It did not take long tc agree to appoint
a conference committee to meet with the
Democrats on the proposition to fuse on
Congressmen, and tben the battle of the
day was inaugurated on the adoption of
the majority report of the sub-committee
recommending a fusion with Democrats I
on Presidential electors. John S. Dore of I
Fresno, National Committeeman from
California, presented the following mi
nority report:
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Executive I
Committee of the People's Party of Californiaâ j
Gentlemen: Not agreeing with the report of '
the joint committee of conference as adopted <
by that body and dissenting from the action
taken by ti>e other members of the committee
appointed by this body, 1 deem it my duty to
give my reasons why I could not sign" the "ma
jority report, and while being duly impressed
with the extieme gravity of the situation, I
am constrained to present this minority re
port.
The National Convention of the People's
party, held at St. Louis July 22, 1896, nom
inated tne Hon. Thomas E. Watson oi Georgia j
as its candidate for the office of Vice- President.
This was done in an unusual and most em
phatic manner, thus expressing to the whole
Nation the steadfastness and fidelity of that I
great convention to the cardinal principles of
the People's party.
The lion. William Bryan of Nebraska was
subsequently nominated by the same conven
tion as its candidate for the exalted |
position of standard-bearer of that Darty, even j
to a wider extent than he was an exponent j
of the principles and the platform of the
Democratic party as declared at Chicago in
1896.
These are the nominees of the St. Louis con
vention of the People's party, to whom our
party exacts allegiance and fidelity.
The Democratic convention at Chicago nomi
nated the Hon. Arthur Sewall of Maine for the
office of Vice- President, to whom this majority
report attempts to bind tbe People's party of
this State to cast rive electoral votes where but
four are cast for Thomas E. Watson.
The People's party is an organized National
movement of great power in opposition to
monopoly of money, monopoly of transporta
tion and monopoly of land, and yet in this
majority report you would force the loyal Peo
ple's party voteis of this State to support Hon.
Arthur Sewall, whose career has been in direct
opposition to these reforms and whose per
sonal interest and environments make him an |
unsafe leader in the Interest and for the wel- I
Jaraof the plain people in this hour of our
emergency.
Mr. Sewall holds large interests in the na- i
tional banks, is a leading railroad monopolist
of New England, is many times a millionaire,
whose vast possessions have been acquired
through the direct aeency of special legislation
and corporate monopoly. : â¢ : - . ; â 
This majority report asks the People's
party of this State to yield the principles of
their party and to support the nomination to
the extent of casting five votes for Sewall and
four for Watson. Â : â  - : . ; :
The Democratic party of California cannot
affordâ and much less can the People's partyâ
to leave this matter of | Presidential electors as
provided in this majority report unless
wholly indifferent to results at the ballot-box,
lor you can never force even a majority of the
loyal People's party voters to stultify them
selves by voting for Arthur Sewall.
They will either stay away from the polls or
vote only for the four People's party electors
whom they know will vote for Bryan and
Watson.
So inconsistent with the platform adopted at
Chicago and the nomination of Mr. Bryan was
the nomination of Mr. Sewall that many of the
delegates to that convention : from California
absolutely relused to vote to make his nomi
nation unanimous. And yet it is proposed by
the adoption of this â  majority report to . force
the People's party to do what Democrats re
fused to do on principle!
- I fail to understand what has transpired to
change conditions and make them more favor
able to the candidacy of Mr. Sewall than they
were on July 16 at Chicago or on July 22 at St.
Louis, or than they were on August 4, when
this State Executive Committee deliberately,
after exhaustive consideration, issued the fol
lowing address to the People's party of Cali
fornia, from which the following extracts are
taken:
[Here follows the circular address issued
by the State Executive Committee on
August 4.] .
Those who gladly signed this address and
have since signed this majority report giving
to Mr. Sewall a majority of the People's party
votes of California must have experienced a
change of heart, to which I am as yet a
stranger.
Personally, I am not in accord with this
majority report for other reasons than those
given.
Firstâ l am here as the representative of the
loyal People's party of Fresno County. From
them I receive my commission and instruc
tion and to them must account for my acts.
Secondâ On this committee I to some extent
represent the members of the party in this-
State.
Thirdâ a member of the National Execu
tive Committee of the People's party 1 know
that I am, and cannot evade it, the direct rep
resentative of the National head of the party
whose candidates are Bryan and Watson.
Chairman Butler of the People's â¢ party ex
ecutive committee at its session August 18
said: "Sewall does not represent the Popu
lists, and under no circumstances will they
counsel to vote for him,"
Since our convention. at St. Louis the Na
tional Democratic management seems to have
been trying to defeat a union of the silver
forces, instead of skillfully laboring- to secure
tnen union.
It has at times presented, and even now pre
sents, much evidence of being in the hands
and under the control of the old instead of the
new Democracy.
The number of leaders of . political promi
nence that have been called to the National
Committee councils whose views are strongly
opposed to the political principles Mr. Bryan
holds, as well as to the Democratic plaform, is
ominous.
The lollowing, which I clipped from the San
Francisco Examiner of August 23, gives some
glimpse of National Democratic management:
[Here follows letter from Editor West
ol the Silver Knight dated Washington,
D. C, Aug. 22.] -y, Â\
Will those who claim political . consistency
in asking People's party votes to be cast for
the Democratic nominee for Vice- President,
Mr. Sewall, instead of the People's party nom
inee, Mr. Watson, also claim that, it would be
proper for People's party members of the next
Legislature to c*.Â»t their votes for a nominee
of the Democratic party ior United States Sen
ator instead of the People's party nominee?
For reasons heroin set forth, and believing
that to secure the election of Mr. Bryan and
reforms demanded by the People's party plat
form and the Democratic platform it is neces
sary to have a full electoral ticket for Bryan
and Watson, 1 therefore respectfully offer this
minority report. Respectfully submitted,
John S. Dobs.
The committee decided to fuse on
electors and to give Watson four votes to
SewalPs five, notwithstanding that Sewall
represents the antipodes of .Populism.
There were three votes against the
treason, and these three men will be hon
ored by the Populists of California as
standing up for the principles of their
party and not unfaithful to the gallant
Tom Watson, their standard-bearer. They
are:
John S. Pore,
K. E. Bush,
C. 11. Castle.
There were three absentees, but these
had given their assent by letter to the ma
jority report, so that tne men who were
willing to pledge the Populists oik this
State to give more votos for Sewall than
they would to Watson were ten in num
ber, as follows:
J. K. Camp, A. B. Kinne,
M. K. Dlttmar. J. C. Gore.
K. M. "Ward all, G. I). Gillespie,
J. M. Moore, Carl. H. Johnson,
F. Houghton, B. A. Mason.
The following were appointed a com
mittee on conference to co operate with
similar committees from the Democratic
and Silver parties, to meet to-day and re
ceive the resignations of the persons nom
inated for Congress should any resign: J.
W. Keegan, C. W. Thresher, J. M. Moore,
A. B. Kinne, E. M. Wardall and John S.
Dore.
After this work was done a resolution
was adopted to keep Mr. Dore's minority
report from the press. But the resolution
was too late, because Mr. Dore had al
ready given his report to a Call reporter.

WHAT MONTEITH SAYS.
A Plot Aoralnst Him by Democrats
and the Southern Pacific.
George W. Monteith states that the work
of the fusion committee of fifteen is mainly
directed against him as candidate for Con
gress in the First District.
The railroad company first tried to get a
Democrat nominated, not being particular
as to whom. When that scheme failed be
cause of Monteith's firmness tne next
proposition was that the corporation
would have the Democrats take any Popu
list except Monteith. The only concession
it demanded was that Monteith should be
eliminated from the fight. It had gone so
far as to threaten that it would spend a
large sum of money to beat Monteith if he
remains on tne ticket.
It has advanced the proposition that
Mr. Huntington would take no personal
interest in the tiuht in case Mr. Monteith
was pulled down, but that otherwise he
would be compelled to personally interest
himself to secure Monteith's defeat. That
with Huntington it was not a question of I
the railroad interests but it was a personal
matter between him and Monteith, and
that he would not object to spending any
thing that was uecessary to prevent
j any recognition of Monteith. The whole
I railroad forces are at work throughout
I the district trying to manufacture senti-
I ment against Monteith.
There are a number of his fellow-candi
dates upon the ticket for different offices
who hope to profit by his sacrifice. A
most desperate fight is in progress, but
Monteith holds the key to the situation.
He cannot be pulled down, as his enemies
admit, and''he will not surrender. He is
, so decided in tbis matter that they are be
ginning to waver, and in the end will have
I to come to his terms.
Monteith is making a brilliant cam
paign and meeting with great enthusiasm
I wherever he speaks.
His vigorous and hearty denunciation of
the railroad is causine no end of uneasiness
in the building at Martetand Montgomery
I streets. His record as an an ti -railroad
tighter is what worries them, and the
existence of a large body of Populists wno
are getting sick of the fusion business
maKes the attack on him a serious matter.
He is the only man among the leaders at
this time who is in the siiuation to lead a
"middle-of-the-road" right, and the "mid
dle-of-the-road" people are ready to jump
in if he will but say the word.
It is rumored that Mr. Monteith has
been approached on the proposition of
doing this, but has so far refused, not de
siring to en age in any factional fights.
Monteith's great strength in tbe district
cannot be denied, and it begins to look as
if it would be another Sutr<> fight. Three
Democratic county conventions have in
dorsed him in terms. Sonoma County is
already going wild in that direction. His
name is cheered whenever mentioned. If
the committee on fusion should attempt
to turn him down it will be a sorry day for
tbe man wfio does it. judging from pre?
ent indications.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 1896.
THE PLAYERS AND
THE PLAYER-FOLK
New Society Drama Pro
duced at the Co
lumbia.
A LARGE ATTENDANCE.
Second Week of the " Gay Pa
risians" at the Baldwin
Theater.
NEW PEOPLE AT MOROSCO'S.
Were Welcomed With Demonstra
tions of Hearty Ap
plause.
"The Social TruÃt," an original drama
in four acts by Ramsay Morris and
Hillary Bell of New York, had its first
production in public last evening. The
Columbia Theater, where it was produced,
supplied the finest equipment, superb cos
tuming, excellent stage pictures and last
of all a cast of unusual merit, but with all
these advantages and accessories the
drama did not meet the ex
pectations of the audience. It is
not heavy or dull. Its deficiency
seems to be in its lightness. The finale in
particular is light. Since the authors have
borrowed something from another play in
the suggestion of an individual presence
by the scent of perfumery, some further
borrowing might be made to excite interest
in the fortunes of the paper trust. A few
messenger boys tumbling over each other
and the click of stock-tickers could be em
ployed to produce the effects of a Wall
street panic. To insure success the fourth
act must be strengthened at the culmi
nating scene.
There is no dominating central figure in
the play, but the part of Frederick Brew
ster, performed by Wilton Lackaye, is the
most important character. Next in the
order of prominence is Daniel Hallock by
Maclyn Arbuckle. These actors brought
out the full measure of force with which
the piece is endowed.
Mrs. Thorndyke Boucicault as Lillian
Cornell sustained a leading part and sure
ly acquitted herself with merit. A pleas
ing diversion was the dialogue between T.
Daniel Frawley as Philip Cornell and
Miss Hope Ross as Dora Sprague.
Miss Blanche L. Bates as Mrs.
Bleecker Nelson has an opportunity for
acting in the cleverest scene in the play â
the scene where she saves the reputation
of Mr 3. Brewster by substituting herself
for that lady and impressing Captain
Wynne (Tyrone Powers) into service as a
lover. She made the most of the advan
tages offered there, and received applause
in the final act for "lying like a lady" to
save the honor of another lady. The part
of Mrs. Williams Merton was taken by
Miss Madge Carr Cook. She handled it
admirably.
The house was crowded in e?ery part, a
number of first-nighters being present.
Among those present were:
Mr. and Mrs. George Crocker and party, Mr.
and Mrs. Morton and party, Mrs. Carroll Coot
and party, Mrs. H. Triest and party. Mr. D.
Harvey and party, Home West Club, "Mr. D. E.
Behlow and party. Mr. Charles Fair and party,
Mr. M. Hellman Jr. and party, Mr. William
G. M. Schilling, a One- Armed Athlete, Who Arrived Last Night From Pittsburg'
Accompanied by His Dog, King. He Claims That They Have Covered the
Distance From That City of 3750 Miles in 12(6 Days, on Foot, and Without
Begging or Spending Money.
Hlnckley and party, Mr. Charles Rosenbaum
and family, Mr. Georue A. Knight and party,
Mr. J. Montgomery and famiLy, Mr. Joseph D.
Bedding and party, Mr. Fred West and party,
Mr. John B. Schoeffel, Mr. Charles Webb
Howard.
At the Baldwin.
The second wees of that mirth-provoking
comedy, "The Gay Parisians, ' opened at the
Baldwin Theater last evening, and there was
a fairly good audience, one that was convulsed
with laughter from the first scene in the first
act to the falling of the curtain on the last.
Seldom has a neater aggregation of odd ana
comic situations been presented to the theater
goers than is given in the three acts of this
comedy, Joseph Pinglet, the master builder,
as presented by XV. J. Furgeson, and Msrcelia,
personated by Sadie Martinot, who are the life
of the piece, were as intensely amusing as
during the first week, and the rest of the com
pany will continue during the week to furnish
medicine lor those suffering from the blues.
Grand Opera-Honse,
"The Nutmeg Match," a character study of
rural life in Connecticut, was presented to a
full house at the Grand Opera-house last even
ing, and in its presentation were introduced
Edward J. flerron, the new low comedian, and
Lottie Williams, a vivacious singing soubrette.
These new people, who, in addition to acting,
combine vocal and heel-and-toe specialties,
took the nouse by storm, establishing them
selves as favorites upon their nrst appearance,
A good deal of the comedy-drama is of th c
Josh Whitcomb style, but in the second act
there is much of base villainy and devoted
love. There is a fine scene at the close of this
act in which a piledriver is at work, and Wil
liam Hartley, the hero, is saved from being
crushed to death by the hammer of the pile
driver by "Cinders." Julia Blanc gave a good
representation of a much-inciined-to-marry
widow, and Carl Smith was an acceptable
heavy villian. The piece will fill the house
every night.
At The Orphenm,
The additions to the Orpheum's bill this
week consist of Miss Nellie Maguire, a charac
ter singer and dancer, Richard Pitrot, who
rejoices in the sobriquet, "The Meteor of
Mimicry," and Albini, a card-trick man. Miss
Majyuire sings with the approved music-hall
stamp, and acts with all the requisite vim.
The London coster girl, her best impersona
tion, quite brought down the house. From
her accent and general makeup, it is evident
Miss Maguire studied the coster girl on her
native heath in the purlieus of Whitechapel
and Old Gravel Lane.
The Meteor of Mimicry is a rapid-change
artist, who gives some good impersonations of
living celebrities. Bismarck, Gladstone, etc.,
are hailed with placid recognition, but the
Congressional candidates arouse a storm of
recognition.
Albini, the card- trick man, interested the
audience, though there is nothing particu
larly new about his performance.
The versatile Biondi has entirely changed
his programme this week. "In a Dancing
School" he introduces no less than five char
acters, all of which Biondi sustains with the
ease with which most actors sustain a single
role. The comedy is very amusing, ana there
is something which almost suggest* a ma
hatma in the rapidity with which the imper
sonator walks out of one door as a dancer and
immediately re-enters it as a cook or a lover.
Two characteristic Neapolitan songs are also
well rendered by Biondi.
Favor and Sinclair are giving a clever per
formance in their skit, "The Maguires," Herr
Techow's remarkable performing cats still re
main on tbe bill and the four Nelson sisters
win deserved applause for their acrobatic
performances.
At the Tivoli.
"La Travlata" was produced for the first
time this season at the Tivoli last night, and
its melodious, iamiliar music received an in
terpretation which won much deserved ap
plause.
Maurice de Vries,;as George Germont, was
the star of the cast. Although dignified and
impressive in his acting, he never lapsed into
being the mere heavy father, and the music
of the role proved to be admirably adapted to
his full, resonant voice.
The part of Violetta gives scope for acting
not often found in the old Italian operas aud
Mme. Natali presented quite an impassioned
interpretation of the role. Her scene with
George Germont was particularly well sung
and acted. In the first act she showed a slight
tendency toward stridency in her singing, but
during the latter act she modified this
and sang charmingly. Fernando Micheleni
made a warm, impassioned Alfreddo and sang
with his usual dramatic expression and clear
enuueiation. De Vries gave his part in French,
while the others sang in Italian, but this was
a minor detail, which had no effect on the suc
cess of the performance.
The orchestra, under the direction of Gnstav
Hinrichs, did its usual excellent work. To
night the double bill "Cavalleria Rusticana"
aud excerpt from "Romeo and Juliet" will be
furnished.
The Chutes.
The evening performance in the Casino at
the Haighi-street grounds last evening was
witnessed by an appreciative audience. here
was a good variety performance. One of the
new features at this place is tne wonderful
illusion entitled "Cleopatra," which shows a
mummy turning into a most beautiful woman.
The outside attractions had good patronage,
as the moonlit evening was a pleasant one to
enjoy a ride ou the scenic railway or one down
the chutes.
A ONE-ARMED WALKER,
G. M. Schilling and His Dog
"King" Foot It From
Pittsburg.
He Must Neither Beg Nor Spend
Money, and Must Return
With $1000.
G. M. Schilling, a one-armed athlete,
arrived in this City at 5:30 last evening
trom Pittsburg, claiming to have walked
the entire distance of 3750 miles in 126
days. He is a memoer of the Ellsworth
Athletic Club of Pittsburg and is walking
on a wager. According to the terms of an
agreement be can neither beg assistance
in any form nor spend money on his trip,
and must return to Pittsburg with $1000.
He must cover the distance of 7500 miles
in ten months.
He started out with an advertising
scheme by which he hoped to earn the
needed sum, but it was a failure, and he is
forced to rely on other means of making
up the $1000.
His first doe-companion, "King," died
sqon#after beginning the journey, and he
Ficked up another, which he calls "King
I." The animal nas trotted faithfully
at his master's athletic heels through all
tne long leagues of their trip with more
or less misery in the way of hunger and
fatigue, as Schilling can neither purchase
food for himself nor dog. On the desert near
Winnemucca the .biped walker was forced
to carry his four-footed comrade two days,
King having given out.
When the two came off the ferry last
evening they looked the worse for wear,
notwithstanding the dog was dressed up
in ribbons gay. Schilling's shoes are full
of holes and his brick-colored sweater all
tattered and torn.
"I have had a pretty tough time,' r said
he to the artist who was transferring him
to paper. ''Raising $1000 is hard work for
a single-armed man in most any kind of a
job. I have only earned so far $'200, but as
I am about twenty-six days ahead of time
and have over six months yet before me, I
think I will gather in the remaining $800.
If 1 succeed $2i)00 is mine when I get back
to Pittsburg.
" I don't know, however, about the dog,
as he is almost played out now. I will
rest him a week here, and if he feels he
can reach Pittsburg we'll start back to
gether. I look rather seedy, but if some
of my brother athletes or wheelmen of the
City have anji old sweaters or shoes to
give away possibly lean spruce up a bit,
You seÂ« I dare not buy anything and my
hard appearance must speak for me."
is an athlete of no mean abil
ity and has made several fine records. In
Aprii, 1895, he walked from Pittsburg to
New York, 444 miles, in nine days, beating
the best previous time by three days. His
100-yard dasli is in 10,2-5 seconds, his run
n.ng broad jump is 21 feet 6 inches, run
ning high jump 5 feet 8 inches, and he
holds the record of hop, step and jump of
46 feet 8 inches. In 1894 he* jumped from
a Pittsburg bridge 110 feet, and last May
he leapea into the Mississippi River at
Clinton, lowa, a descent of 140 feet. He
lost his left arm at the shoulder when
nine years old.
WILL HAUNT THE
WOMAN IN BLACK,
0. F. Bernhard in Sorrow
and Despair Takes
His Own Life.
THE DEADLY GASJET.
A Divorce Suit Instigated a
Few Days Is Still
Pending.
SEQUEL OF A SHOOTING AFFEAY
Deceased Made an Attempt to Kill
the Destroyer of Hs Home
Two Months Ago.
"Yon are not to wear mourning on my
account if you do not wish me to haunt
you."
This weird statement is embodied in a
letter which was written Sunday evening
by 0. F. Bernhard, Mission-street car con
ductor No. 853, and addressed to his wife
a few minutes before he took his own life
in the St. David's House, 218 Tehama
street.
Bernhard. who resided at 10 Fowell
avenue, called at the St. David's
House Sunday afternoon and procured a
room. Ho took possession of it,
and, as all indications point, de-
O. F. Bernhard, Who Committed Suicide
in the St. David House Sunday
Evening.
liberately prepared to commit sui
cide. He carried with him a small
roil of brown paper and a bottle of
mucilage and last evening when his body
was found rigid in death by F. Boesmann,
the lodging-house clerk, the gas was still
flowing from a single jet and every crevice
through which the deadly fluid misrht
have escaped was sealed with the paper
the suicide had carried with him the
evening before. ,
The suicide is the aftermath of an un
happy marriage. About three years ago
Bernhard took as his wife Mac W. Wal
kinson, daughter of Mrs. H, Walkinson,
who resides at 1401 Folsom street. This
marriage proved the young man's down
fall.
He commenced suit for divorce against
his wife on August 19. The suit formed
the sequel to an attempt made by Bern
hard some two months ago to kill S. A.
Erwin in a restaurant at the corner of Mis
sion and Thirtieth streets. He charged
Erwin with being the destroyer of his
heme- Erwin was named as co-respondent
in the suit for divorce, and the complaint
charged that the wife had been guilty of
various acts of infidelity. Erwin was a
motorman on the San Francisco and San
Mateo Railroad, but resigned his position
the day following the shooting affray and
left for Los Angeles. Up to the time the
divorce proceedings were instigated Mrs.
Bernhard was employed as a typewriter
by the Revere Rubber Company on Mar
ket street, but when her troubles became
public she lost her position.
Two letters were written and left by de
ceased, one addreysed to hi? wife and the
other to her mother. The letter written
Mrs. Bernhard, which thoroughly ex
plains the trouble which led up to the
tragic culmination, is as follows:
City, August 23. 1896.
Dear Mac: In a few moments I will stand
before my Maker, and so you may believe what
I assert to be the truth. Had I known that the
papers would get hold of your letter to me I
would rather have cut off my right band than
insisted on a divorce on the grounds specified.
Your mother is very unreasonable, and in an
interview I had with her this evening she
insisted that the fault was all mine. She
made a proposition to me, which if I carry it
out will either dishonor me among my friends
for life or leave me, in their estimation, a
fool. I am too sensitive to submit to
cither, and so choose to cross the
dark river. I have suffered much in the last
two months, but I fully and freely forgive
your share of its cause. Take my adviceâ the
iast I can give you or any one on this earthâ
and accept tbo welcome offered you by your
mother. I leave an envelope addressed to you
which contains $9 95, besides the pay due'me
at the office for Friday, Saturday and Sunday,
in all amounting to $7 40. Coffin, who runs
the cigar-store, has an order on the Market
street Railroad Company for my deposit of $25,
$20 of which he loaned me. He may or mny not
give you the balance. At any rate, try and get
the deposit in lull and settle with Coffin your
self. Under no circumstances are you or your
mother to bear any part ol the expense of my
burial. Let the City bury me in the potters'
field; it is plenty good enough for me. You
are not to wear mourning on my account, if
you do not wish me to haunt you. God bless
you and keep you in the right path. I am
sorry for nothing, except that I did not have a
big enough gun to kill that man Erwin. It
is for that reason I choose the gas
route, as I dare not trust my 32
-caliber pistol for fear of making a mess of
it, and to-day being Sunday, I could not buy a
bigger gun. I blame you for nothing, so be of
good cheer. You will find my trunk packed
at my room. In the top drawer among the
soiled wash clothing is all my jewelry. Your
mother refcred to a friend of mine who called
to sympathize with her. If McClory is not
the one, please let him have my pipe. With
the rest do as you like. Your husband,
O. F. Beknhard.
It is evident that Bernhard was inclined
to blame his mother* in-law for his
troubles, as the following letter, written to
her, would indicate:
Mm. H. Walkinton â I hope yon are satisfied
with the work you accomplished this evening.
O. F. Bernhakd.
When Mrs. Walkinson was informed of
the death of her son-in-law last evening
she Became hysterical and refused to talk
about the affair.
Deputy Coroners O'Brien and Smith re
moved Bernhard's body to the Morgue,
and in all probability, as requested, it will
be buried by the City.

THE RELIANCE ELEVEN,
"Cal" Ewing Manager, and a
Captain to Be
Elected.
St. Mary's College Trying for a
Thanksgiving Match With
Reno, Nsv.
The Reliance Club will put a football
team in the field this reason.
J. "Cal," Ewing, the club's well-known
baseball and football manager, has as
sumed the management of the prospective
eleven, a captain for which will be elected
next Thursday evening, at a meeting to be
held for that purpose in the club building.
At the same time a general discussion of
ways and means and possible players will
take place, and the date for the beginning
of practice wili be set. Ewing, who is
chief assistant in the County Clerk's office
in OaKhind, is enthusiastic and energetic.
"The make-up of the Reliance team is
problematical." said he yesterday. "So
far nothing has been done in the way of
speaking for new men, but Thursday's
meeting will start the Dall rolling. Harry
Walton and Fred Oliver have been voted
into the team. It is very likely that Walton
will be elected captain. We count on
Burnett for center, Lanyon and Wil
son for ends, Bert Oliver for
tackle or guard, Wyckoff for fullback,
Walton and Frankenheimer for halves and
Harrelson for quarter. Wilson, end on the
Berkeley Varsity last season, will play, but,
as 1 said before, no action has been taken
yet, and we are not sure of either Jb ranken
heimer or Harrelson. We hope to get
them. In addition we will have Huff and
Franklin and Wells of Livermore, who is a
brother of Charlie Wells, the cyclist.
Then Frick, last year's captain, may play.
If he decides to, of course be will have a
place on the team."
Burnett is a Stanford graduate, and
played two seasons on the Varsity before
he filled the center position for Reliance
last year. Lanyon, Wyckoff, Huff and
the Oliver brothers were with the Reliance
team before, but Bert Oliver, it is said,
will enter Stanford next month. Wilson
and Wells are new recruits for Reliance.
Walton played halfback on the Reliance
| team during the season of '94. For two
years previously he was a student at Stan
ford University, where hs finished his
sophomore year. He was halfback on
the Varsity team of 92 and of '93, catcher
and captain of the Varsity nine of '93 and
catcher of the team of '94. Before
| entering Stanford he was the star
j baseball-player at the University of the
I Pacific. He has also played ball with the
! Olympic nine. Harrelson is another Stan
j ford graduate, and was the Varsity quar
terback of '94; he played with the Reliance
team on its tour of the Northwest last fall.
Frankenheimer, for four years a member
of the Stanford Varsity, was graduated
from college last May and is now in this
City.
Dr. Harry Carleton, a prominent mem
ber of the Reliance Club, said yesterday
that he will take no hand in the main
tenance of a football team this year.
"Some of us got enough of it last sea
son," he remarked significantly, 'a burnt
child fears the fire. 1 We went down into
our pockets and paid what was short on
expenses. What's more, I am tired of this
thing of hunting employment for players,
and I'm opposed to tne principle of it."
Paul Downing, captain of the Stanford
Varsit.y in 1894, captain of the Tacoma
Athletic Club team in 1595 and tackle on
the Reliance eleven when it met the
Butte, Montana, team here last winter,
has had more all-rounu football experi
ences than any other player on the coast.
As a freshman he was halfback on Stan
ford's first Varsity team. The next year
he played euard. In 1893 he was center
rush and in 1894, his senior year, was cap
tain and tackle. Last fail he came down
from Washington to help coach the Palo
Alto men lor the big intercollegiate game.
He is in business now in San Francisco.
"I have read in some of the papers,"
said he yesterday, "that I am to play this
season with the Olympics and with, the
Reliance. I don't know where they got
the information, for nothing has been said
tc me about playing or to Harreison
either, nor have I thought of playing. My
business keeps me pretty ousy, but I
mean to go down to the university and
help coÂ«ch the boys. I shall be down
there one afternoon a week at least and
oftener as the season advances." He thinks
Stanfords prospects are encouraging,
St. Mary's College is to have a coach
from among the ranks of the Reliance
players. The man has not yet been de
cided upon, but will be during the week,
as the first lesson is to be given next Sat
urday afternoon. After that the coach
ing will go on regularly on Wednesday
and Saturday afternoons." Manager Gree
ley was in this City yesterday ordering
suits for the team. He says St. Mary's
Colleee will have an eleven this year
averaging about 165 pounds to the man.
Practice games will be played with the
Reliance team. An effort will be made to
23t a match with the Reno (Nev.) team for
Thanksgiving day. In the meantime a
game will be played with the Santa Clara
College team to inaugurate what it is
hoped will become an annual affair. If
possible games will be played with the
Stoctton team, with the Saiita Cruz High
School team, with Vallejo, with Sacra
mento and withlhe Oakland High School
team. The manager also hopes for a
chance with either or both of the univer
sity teams, and will endeavor to get some
sort of a match, not with any hope of win
ning, but that his men may measure their
ability.
A Dwelling on Fire.
A little before i o'clock this morning a fire
was discovered in a two-story dwelling, un
occupied, at 342 Union street, and an alarm
was sounded from box 7. The house is owned
by Jean Salanave and it was damaged to the
extent of abou t $300. The cause of the fire is
unknown.

FOR GOLD AT WASHINGTON
The Inside Opinions of Clerks
and Department Offi
cials.
Attorney W. W. Dcdge on th? Feeling
There, in Illinois and
Elsewhere.
William W. Dodge, a prominent attor
ney of Washington, D. C, who is here in
connection with an important patent case
to be tried at San Jose, is at the Palace.
He says that it is impossible for Calilor
nians to understand the suffering that has
existed for some time past at Washington"
from the hot weather. The prostrations
had somewhat decreased when Mr. Dodge
left, but there were still some deaths from
sunstrokes. It has been the hottest and
longest period of such weather known in
many years.
In regard to politics at Washington and
Illinois, where he stopped on his way, Mr.
Dodge said:
"1 think the majority of the sentiment
in Washington is for gold. Undoubtedly
the department people, that is, those who
hold the political offices, are in favor of
gold. They are always a little cautious as
to how they talk, for Mr. Cleveland not
long since sent out some more notices that
he did not desire exhibitions of strong par
tisanship. However, of course they know
Cleveland is for gold, and so they are not
so particular about withholding opinions
in its favor, and these go, too.
"Have they any idea of a possibility that
Mr. Bryan might move into the White
House? Not at all, I think. They have
no idea that he has a chance. They think
wnen it comes to the worst the gold
Democrats will exert every endeavor to
defeat him.
"There is a great battle going on in Illi
nois now, and t!"ough all tbe newspapers
and the better element are for gold, Alt
geld'has such an influence with the unthink
ing masses that the end is not clearly seen.
It is believed, however, that the State will
go for Mr. McKinley."
Mr. Dodge has lived in Washington
many yÂ»ars. He will be in California for
about a week.
UNSANITARY BUILDINGS
The Board of Health Discover* More
Dangerous Structures in the Chi

As a result of the visit of squads of
health inspectors to Chinatown, a number
of buildings, in addition to those tbat
were condemned by the board a few days
ago, have been discovered to be in a dan
gerous condition and will probably De
placed on the retired list within a few
days.
Dr. Lovelace stated last evening that
several structures on i)upont street would
be ordered vacated and the owners or
dered, as soon as they can be notified, to
tear them down. Id reference to those re
cently condemned Dr. Lovelace stated
that as the owners or agents of a number
had not been reached trie fifteen days' no
tice sent out by tbe Doard preparatory to
tearing down would not be strictly en
forced.
The owners will be given a few days and
then the orders of the board will be car
ried out, unless in tne meaiuiue some
thine occurs to change the minds of the
members of the Health Board.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION
and PROSPERITY.
FOR PRESIDENT-
WILLIAH McKINLET, of Oblo
FOB VICF-PRBBIDENT-
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
JBXKCTION NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
Where there is thorough organization
there is sure to be harmony.
Democrats and Populists may pull to
gether, but they cannot organize together.
Getting together means harmony first,
organization second and victory in the
end.
The Republican who kicks against the
party now will be kicking himself before
long. _
The country is still waiting to hear what
Mr. Bryan or his party promises the work
ingman.
What troubles Cleveland more than
anything else is the degeneration of his
Cabinet.
Men who work for American industry
may be counted on to vote for American
industry.
The free-traders are not talking much
this year, but they will vote for Bryan just
the same.
The best way to support Republican
principles is to make yourself a part of or
ganized Republicanism.
Is California Populism a cat that it
should be made to rake out of the fire all
the chestnuts for Democracy ?
It is said that Hill has invited Bryan to
dinner, but it will be remembered Hill in
vited Jones to dinner. Dinners are cheap.
California will march in the Republican
column in November provided the Repub
licans of the State will furnish it a true
harmony to march to.
The first step in the campaign of all
loyal Republicans should be to join a Re
publican club, for .that 13 the way to catch
step with the procession and keep it.
Democracy says nothing in this cam
paign about sugar, wool, lumber, raisins,
fruit, borax â in fact there i.s no California
industry about which Democracy does say
anything.
There should be a Republican club in
every school district of the State, for this
is to be a campaign of education and
should have a center wherever there is a
schoolhouse.
Major McKinley has already made over
fifty speeches during the campaign and
every one of them carries to the country a
promise of prosperity with an assurance
of statesmanship.
Free trade may suit some people, but it
suits none who wish to develop tbe re
' Bources of America, to keep up the price of
American products and advance the rate
of American wages.
Mining counties, farming counties, 'wool
counties and fruit counties are all inter
ested in protection, and all should have
strong Republican clubs to work for Mc-
Kinley and prosperity.
The magnificent organization of tbe Re
publican party in the great States of the
East should rouse the emulation of Cali
fornia Republicans and inspire them with
a determination to equal it.
No Republican dislikes Mr. Bryan ; no
one has said a word against him. So far
as we are concerned he may go through
the campaign on flowery beds of ease, and
console himself after it is over by frolic
ing among the chrysanthemums.
The pledge of the Republican party in
California in favor of woman's suffrage
puts it in the van of a great movement for
equal rights, and that is another reason
why progressive men and women should
ally themselves with it ana champion its
cause.
Tbe Republican party has pledged it
self to promote the free coinage of silver
by international agreement, and the peo
ple know that Republican statesmen have
both the honesty to keep the pledge and
tbe ability to carry it out without disturb
ing business.
L. C. Bateman, Populist candidate for
Governor in Maine, has given the fusion
fixers a pointe;' in saying, "Apropos of
bewail, we beg to remind our Democratic
friends that cuttinp'off the ears of a jack
ass and pinning a few feathers on his tail
doesn't make him a canary bird."
While we are sure of carrying California
for the great principles of protection,
reciprocity and international bimetallism,
we must not be so sanguine as to neglect
organization nor so indifferent as to per
mit the development of a factional spirit
in the party rants. We must organize;
we must harmonize; we must work to
gether for victory.
PARTY HARMONY.
The contrast between National Republi
canism and Nationa) Democracy in this
campaign is most striking. In the central
organization of the Republican pariy there
is harmony of sentiment, unity of action
and a well-disciplined co-operation every
where that gives to the party the coher
ence of a well-ordered army confident in
its leaders and inspired with enthusiasm
for a great cause. In the central Demo
cratic organization there is discord, con
fusion, demoralization and the mutual
criminations and recriminations of men
who have neither confidence in one an
other nor in themselves, and whose fac
tion fights not only assure defeat in the
coming election but presage the destruc
tion of the organization as a political
party.
This contrast between the National or
ganizations of the two great parties em
bodies an important lesson to the Repub
licans of California. On the one hand
there is harmony and the assurance of
victory, on the other is discord and the
certainty of defeat. No argument in favor
of party discipline in the State could be
more effective than a consideration of the
attitnde of the two parties before the Na
tion. We cannot expect the National
ticket to save the State, Congressional and
county tickets for the Republican party
unless the Republicans of California show
as much loyalty to the local organization
as they do to that of the Nation; and that
loyalty must be made manifest in the one
case as in the other by harmony of senti
ment, unity of effort and thorough dis
cipline in the ranks.
In every large aggregation of men there
are always those who are ambitious of a
leadership they have not the ability to ex
ercise, tliose who are discontented unless
they have their way in everything, those
who are disposed to magnify every petty
evil in their own party while overlooking
gross ones in the opposition, and those
who by reason of some personal spite or
dissatisfaction with chosen leaders seek in
every way to weaken their influence and
if possible to prevent victory under their
management. Such men are, of course, to
be found in tha P oublican party of Cali
fornia and it is the duty of loyal members
to be on guard against them and ever
prompt to baffle their efforts to breed dis
cord in the ranks during the campaign or
scatter the vote on election day.
Mischief-makers in themselves are pow
erless. Their numbers are always few
and they rarely have courage enough to
majte an openly aggressive fight. The in
fluence they exert, however, is always
harmful and in critical moments may be
disastrous. They sneer at the local leaders
of the party, they mock at the plan of
campaign, they misrepresent the truth to
the injury of party interests, they draw
the doubtful from the ranks, make the
timid hesitate, confuse the public mind,
turn away independent voters who do not
know the truth, and thus lose to the party
many votes in every locality where such
mischief-makers are listened to or trusted.
California has too much at stake in this
campaign to run any risks. She must
give her electoral vote for McKinley and
she must send to Congress a solid Repub
lican delegation to uphold his adminis
tration and support him in carrying out
the measures of protection and interna
tional bimetallism. To effect this the Re
publicans of the State must work in unity
and in harmony. Let ns lay aside petty
differences. Let us stand together for
great principles.
TWO PLATFORMS.
â¢ The Republican platform says: "We
are unalterably opposed to every measure
calculated to debase our currency or im
pair the credit of our country."
The Democratic platform declares for
the free and unlimited coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1 without waiting for the
aid or consent of any other nation.
The meaning of the Democratic plat
form is that the mints of the United States
shall be thrown open to the free coinage of
the silver product of all the world, and
that the Government of the United States
will undertake to keep and maintain 50
cents' worth of anybody's silver at a pur
chasing and debt-paying capacity of 100
cents, in opposition to the demands of
commerce and the wish of other nations.
The meaning of the Republican plat
form is that this Government should avoid
everything that is calculated to debase our
money at home or abroad, and that open
ing our mints to the free coinage of the
silver bullion, the silver spoons, the silver
dishes, the silver plate and the silver in
other shapes of the entire world to be
coined into American dollars would de
base the American dollar.
The Democratic platform means that
our gold, our commerce, our agriculture,
our industries and the weli-being of the
people shall be made to submit to a mone
tary system that Horace Boies says is at
best an experiment.
The Republican platform means that
there shall be the largest possible use of
silver dollars; that they shall be the
equivalent of gold dollars the world over,
and that this Government wiil not permit
discrimination against any form of the
Nation's money.
The Democratic platform means that the
country shall be put upon a silver money
basis, thus requiring two standards of
value â one for National and one for inter
national business operations â and that
gold shall be entirely eliminated from the
channels of American commerce.
The Republican platform means that
the enormous volume of trade our
people have with the people of other
countries shall meet in conference
with the commerce of other nations
and come to a mutual agreement
as to how best mints of the several nations
may be opened to the free and unlimited
coinage of silver to the end that commerce
may have a larger volume of redemption
money to meet the demands of its con
stant growth â redemption money com
posed of dollars which shall stand the
one the equal of the other in ail the uses
that dollars are put to.
The Democratic platform means that
commerce at home nor abroad nor the best
good of our home or international busi
ness interests shall be consulted, but that
the people of Europe, Asia, Africa and
South America shall conform without
question to our monetary system â a sys
tem that is condemned by our own busi
ness men â or cease commercial intercourse
with us.
The people should analyze these two
party platforms and see for themselves
how the Democratic platform proposes to
obstruct the highways of trade and traffic,
and how the Republican platform pro
vides for the widening and the deepening
of all the channels of commerce with gold
and silver.
THE SUGAR INDUSTRY..
The annual consumption of sugar in the
United States is now, in round numbers,
2,100,000 tons, which is about sixty-eve
pounds per capita. Of the total consump
tion we produce a little over 350,000 tons,
leaving nearly 1,800,000 to be imported.
We pay annually over $108,000,000 for for
eign sugar and $20,000,000 for domestic
From authentic sources we gather the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 1896.
followinsr, which shows what advantages
would accrue to this country if the Repub
lican policy of protecting the su.'ar in
dustry were permanently operative, the
figures being in round numbers and. the
estimates based upon the homo produc
tion, foreign production and consumption
in the last year of the McKinley act:
To produce the amount of Â»ugar now
imported would require 920 factories with
a capacity of 350 tons of beets each for
ever 3' working day of twenty-four hours.
Each factory would work up the product
of 2000 acres of sugar beets and the 920
factories would utilize the product of
1,800,000 acres. At an average of ten tons
of sugar beets per acre this would equal
18,000,000 tons of beets, which would be
the amount of beets necessary to produce
the sugar now imported. Ttie total num
ber of men employed in the factories and
in the beet fields would represent a popu
lation of about 2,500,000 people.
The average cost of construction of each
factory having a capacity of 360 tons is
$400,000, or fot 920 factories $368,000,000,
which would be distributed among our
machine-shops and the building trades.
Since 90 per cent of nearly all our fabrics
represents labor it would follow that
$331,200,000 would go directly into the
hands of our mechanics and of laborers.
The annual expenditure for materials
and factory expenses, including labor,
would amount Ho over $120,000,000, of
which $30,000,000 would Â«o to farmers for
beets. It would seem that all classes of
people should rive their hearty support to
a proposition that is based upon so much
good common business sense.
BRYAN AND THE POPULISTS.
Bryan's wing of the Democratic party
is beginning to realize what a mistake it
made in capturing the Populist National
Convention, or rather by failing to take it
bag and baggage. There is no doubt at all
that the middle-of-the-road Populists
were given to understand that if the con
vention would nominate Bryan his man
agers could be relied upon to pull Sewall
off the track and make the ticket read
"Bryan and Watson." The leaders of the
radical wing of the Populist party are now
pretty well convinced that it never was
the intention to drop Sewall, and that they
have been wickedly and unmercifully
played upon. The Democracy made a
great mistake when it let slip the oppor
tunity to Bn'anlze the Populist National
Committee, and now it has a bitter family
quarrel on its hands.
L. C. Bateman, Populist candidate for
Governor of Maine, probably voiced the
sentiments of the radical wing of his
party when be said the other day, speak
ing of Sewall, "We beg to remind our
Democratic friends that cutting off the
ears of a jackass and putting a few feath
ers on his tail doesn't make him a canary
brrd." This means that Sewall cannot be
given a thick enough coat of veneering to
make him pass for a Populist. But what
is exasperating the Populists rather more
than anything else is Bryan's refusal to
appoint a time to be notified of his nom
ination by their party. They interpret
his actions as meaning, that he will get
most of the Populist vote anyway, and
does not propose tc be put in a position
where he would have to recognize Wat
son's candidacy.
But the indications are that Bryan is
himself being sold out by local comoina
tions of Democrats and Populists. No one
who has watched the way "fusion" is
accomplished in most of the States could
have failed to see how all deals are made
with reference to Congressmen and Htate
officers. The Populists especially do not
seem to care so much how the electoral
ticket is divided if they can make combi
nations to indorse their State and Con
gressional nominees. In many of the
Southern States overtures have been made
to the Republicans by the Populists with
the view of giving the electoral vote to
McKinley in consideration of Republican
support to their State ticket. In the
North Populists would naturally inse with
the Democrats, but, as we have said,
neither party is taking as much interest
in Mr. Bryan's candidacy as in the State
and Congressional tickets.
No doubt the Populists are actuated
largely by a desire to punish Bryan for re
fusing to recognize Watson, but the
Democrats are fusing in the interest of
local leaders, because they know that not
enoueh Populists will vote for Bryan and
Bewall to make good the loss occasioned
by the bolt of the sound-money wing of
their party, and that whatever can be se
cured ia a local way would be a clear gain.
Bryan's failure to enthuse the people of
the East has weakened him very materi
ally in the West, so much so, indeed, that
even middle-of-the-road silver Democrats
are beginning to express the belief that a
fatal mistake was made in throwing BJand
and Boies overboard. In short, Bryan
grows weaker, the Populists more angry
and fusion for local advantage more
popular. _________________
FREE TRADE AND RUIN.
It is shown in the local columns of to
day's Call that England and the Conti
nent are prosperous by reason of the
many goods they manufacture for export
to America; that they are running their
factories day and night now for fear Mc-
Kinley will be elected, when they know
their career is ended.
Mr. R. Techau, a well-known San Fran
cisco business man, confirms the views
expressed in the foregoing, while a study
of statistical reports proves that labor
prospered under the McKinley bill even
as it is waning now.
The most comprehensive study of the
question confirms the idea that protection
and prosperity are as much synonyms as
are free traMe and ruin.
ORGANIZE! ORGANIZE!
The Democratic party has never won a
victory in California when the Republican
party was well organized, and if the State
goes for Bryan and the nominees of that
party for Congress and State offices this
year it will not be because tbe Democracy
is tbe stronger, but because tbe Republi
cans did not do their duty. California is
naturally a Republican State, but it takes
work to keep it in line.
There never was a campaign that ap
pealed more earnestly to patriotism and
party pride thau the one we are now enter
ing upon; nor was there ever a time in the
history of the party when the necessity for
thorough organization was greater. The
Democracy it very wide awake, and its
leaders are counting upon Republican
apathy to give it the victory, It is for Re
publicans to say whether or not tbe enemy
is counting without its host.
But aside from party pride, there is
much to stimulate the rank and file to en
thusiastic action. Great economic issues
are to be settled, and in many of these Cal
ifornia is deeply interested. The platform
of the Democratic party declares war upon
the agricultural and industrial wealth of
California. It insists that no interest
should be protected from the cheap labor
of China and Japan. It insists that if our
mills, factories and farms cannot maintain
themselves against foreign competition
they should go to the wall. Every Califor
nian knows that protection is absolutely
essential to the upbuilding of the State.
The duty of Republicans in town and
neighborhood to perfect organizations is
apparent and wherever there is failure to
organize it may be said the hands of tne
Democracy are strengthened. It is abso
lutely necessary that the Republican
party should carry California, but it will
not carry it if Republicans do not take
enough interest in their party to organize
for battle.
It matters not if there are not more than
a dozen Republicans in a community, let
them organize. A dozen well-organized
and enthusiastic workers are worth two
dozen indifferents. And especially should
first voters get in line. Aside from the
influence they would exert if organized in
clubs they will be needed to lead in a little
while and the experience they will get in
local organizations is what will fit them
for larger fields of party activity.

LITTLE GIRL'S DRESS.
This charming little gown is made with a
round yoke, as shown in the little deiign on
the right-hand side, from which the skirt por
tion hangs in graceful folds. Or the drese may
be sewn to a band at the top, over which the
collar is sewed, malting a pretty evening dress;
or a day dress to be worn with guimpes. Ii is
pretty with the yoke and star collar. It the
other collar is preferred, square pieces of the
material may be used with d_inty effect.
A dress of bluet crepon, with collar of ecru
linen, is exquisite and extremely stylish.
A gingham gown could be daintily trimmed
by edging the pointed collar with wide Valen
ciennes lace. Or make tne collar of white
linen or lawn and edge It with narrow Valen
ciennes lace of the yellow tint. A guimpe of
the same white goods, tucked and trimmed
with the same lace, is the latest fad, and would
be dainty with a best dress of silk, which
â¢hould also have a white collar.
Tardy Naturalization Suspicious, _*â¢
Stockton Independent.
An Englishman in can Francisco, who de
clared his intention of becoming a citizen of
the United States thlrty-six years ago, carried
out that intention during the present registra
tion period. There is always suspicion ac
tached to these tardy naturalizations that
should be explained to relieve the citizen. The
quality of citizenship so long delayed must
be very much diluted. Bince 'he had lived
under a weak intention thirty-six years he
should have remained a half alien the re
mainder of his life.

Hugh McDonnell, who has made some large
mining sales of California properties during
the last year, has ieturned here after several
weeks in the East. Since arriving he has vis
ited Tuolumne County, and also the Copper
City mines, owned by him aud James Salee, at
Copper City, Shasta County.
These properties are gold and copper, with a
little silver. At present Mr. McDonnell says
he is working but twelve men and is doing de
velopment work solely. The property ia
twent*r-twT> miles northeast of Redding.
"Originally Copper City was an important
placer mining district," said Mr. McDonnell,
"and in the early days from $3,000,000 to
$4,000,000 in gold was taken out. Then the
camp sort of lapsed. In 1872 the ledge was

it was slow again for awhile.
"Now that p*rt of California is looking well,
and we believe that we will develop a great
camp there. The development made through
out the district indicates this in the strongest
way.
"It Jsan attractive region in which to mine.
I like it very well and my partner and myself
will do all we can to make a great mining
country oi it."
Mr. McDonnell left last night for a few
weeks' stay at Ogden, Utah. He has recently
spent a good deal of time in Boston. He had
extensive experience in mining in Montana,
Colorado and Utah prior to becoming inter

WOMEN VOTERS OF NEW ZEALAND
Auckland Times.
The women voters of New Zealand have been
holding a convention in the Provincial Coun

by resolution the desire to abolish capital pun

also passed declaring that "in all cases where
a woman elects to superintend her household
and to be the mother of children there shall
be a law attaching a certain juat share of her
husband's earnings or income for her separate
use, payable if she so desires into her separate
account."
GARFIELD'S LITERARY LIKES.
London Young Man's Journal.
William Black, the novelist, knew John
Bright very well, and at the Reform Club
played many a game of billiards with the
statesman. Their love for salmon-fishing was
another bond of friendship between them.
"During his last illness," Mr. Black says, "Mr.
Bright would often take a rod and pretend to
throw % line in tne effort to realize the pleas
ure of bis favorite sport." By the way, it is in
teresting to note Mr. Black's confession that
not a few of his readers have remonstrated
with him upon the "sad endings" which he
has given to several of his novels. Even the
lnte President Garrield, it seems, was not supe
rior to the amiable weakness. One summer,
hearing from Mr. Carnegie tnat he was proing
to fceoi.and and would call udou William
Black, the President asked him to take a mes
sage to the novelist. Garfield reproached him
for the conclusion of "Maeleod of Dare,"
pathetically adding, '-is there not enough sor
row in the world ? "
HERKOMER'S FILIAL PIETY.

Here is an interesting story oi Professor Her

with him in his splendid home at Bushep. In
his early life he used to model in clay. He
has taken to it again, but his fear is that soon
his hands will lose their sfcill and his work
will show the marks of imperfection. It is his
one sorrow. At night he goes to his early rest,
and when he has gone, Herkoiner, the tnlented
son, goes into the studio, lakes up the father's
leeble attempts and makes the work as beauti
ful as art ran make it. When the old man
comes down in the morning he takes the work
and looks at it, and rubs his hands and says:
"Ha! I can do as well as ever I did."

COLONEL COLNON
ON A WHALE HUNT,
Saw One of the Mammals
Struck Near Half
moon Bay.
NO CAPTURE WAS MADE.
The Harbor Commissioner Was
on the Rover With Com
modore Bruce.
OUT ON A YACHTING CRUISE.
Next Day Mr. Colnon Sighted Another
Whale and Yelled, "There
She Blows."
The handsome little yacht Rover re
turned from a cruise outside yesterday.
President Colnon of the Harbor Commis
sion was the only guest Captain C. C.
Bruce took out with him, and the three
days they spent at sea proved to be a gen
uine treat. They spoke the Queen with
the excursionists on board and were also
in company with the two whaling crews
that went out last Friday. When near
Halfmoon Bay they witnessed a most ex
citing whale hunt, and the next day Presi
dent Colnon himself gave the signal
"there she blows."
On that occasion the yacht and two
whaling boats were at anchor in Half
moon Bay and the whalers at once got
under way, but failed to get near the whale.
The first time the whalers struck a
sulphur bottom, and he led them a merry
dance. Only once did he take a rest, and
then one of the crew got a lance into him.
The mammal then sounded and went down
so last that the line had to be cut in order
to keep the boat from going under. The
next day when President Colnon sighted
the second whale, everything was in a
flurry on the yacht. The sedate Harbor
Commissioner was as anxious to see that
monster captured as the whalers were to
capture him. Captain Bruce was no less
excited, and in an incredibly short space
of time the Rover was unier way and in
the wake of the whaleboats. At the last
moment the whalers seemed to get scared,
and would not approach the monster.
When they did screw their courage to
the sticking point, the whale was gone.
The yacht was then put on her course, and
yesterday afternoon was headed for San
Francisco.
"There are dozens of whales outside,"
said Captain Bruce yesterday, "and I am
almost certain that the crews now out at
sea will bring one in. It will certainly be
their own fault if they don't. The mam
mals take no notice of the boats and the
crew could lay alongside of thfru if they
wanted to, but then the men seemed to
get what the hunters call the 'buck fever'
and get too excited to do anything."
On one occasion during the cruise Com
mrssioner Colnon himself got excited. It
was late Saturday night or early Sunday
morning. There was little or no wind
and the current carried the yacht into
the breakers. The tide was going out,
however, and t&ere was not the slightest
danger, as once inside the bight the little
vessel was carried out to sea with each
succeeding roller. The rolling and pitch-
THE ROVER RETURNING FROM A CRUISE.
President Colnon of the Harbor Commission was out on a yacht
ing cruise last week as the guest of Captain G G Bruce of the
yacht Rover* While away they saw a whale struck and escape,
while another one sighted by Mr* Colnon got away, owing to the
clumsiness of the men*
ing of the yacht awoke Mr. Colnon and he
went on deck to see what was tbe matter.
"What course are you steering?" he asked
the man at the wheel. "I'm blest if I
know. She' 3 steering herself," was the re
ply. 'You see, sir, there's no wind," con
tinued the sailor, "and we haven't steer
age way, so the yacht must drift. Y/e're
going out to sea, however, and there isn't
any danger."
Colnon thought differently, however,
and aroused Bruce, who was in a sound
slumber. The latter went on deck, took a
look around and said, "Go on back to
your bed, we're all right."
"It was one of the most enjoyable
cruises I have been on for a long time,"
said President Colnon, in talking about
his outing yesterday. "Mr. Bruce is an
admirable host, and we had a fine time of
it. I never figured on seeing a whale
hunt, but when it came our way we took
it In. My outing has done me cooa and I
am now ready for another siege of hard
work.' '

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 1896.
The British Ship Muskoka Arrived From Swansea Yesterday With an Addition to Her Crew List. The
Captain's Wife Presented Him With a Son and Heir While the Good Ship Was Battling
With Gales Off Cape Horn.
WAS BORN AMID
SOUTHERN STORMS
Captain Crowe's Wife Pre
sented Him With a Son
and Heir.
A NATIVE OF CAPE HORN
Arrival of the Muskoka With
an Addition to the Crew
List.
WATER-FRONT THIEVES BUSY.
They Steal the Clothing and Shoes
of the Men of the Barkentine
Uncle John.
For the first time in many years a sail
ing vessel arrived in port yesterday, after
a stormy passage around the Horn, with
a new-born babe aboard. The little one
came into the world when the wind was
howling through the rigging of the good
ship Muskoka and every gust put her lee
rail under the water. Captain Crowe's
attention was divided between his wife
and his ship, and between the two he had
an unusually lively time of it for twenty
four hours.
Captain Crowe is determined to make all
his family good sailors, so when he sailed
from Swansea on April 9 last he brought
his wife along. On June 24, in latitude
58 deg. 14 mm. south, longitude 82 deg.
west, his son and heir was born. Every
thing possible was done for the comfort
of the mother and child and both reached
Ban Francisco in safety. Mrs. Crowe is
still very delicate.
In his report Captain Crowe says:
"We sailed from Swansea on April 9 and
had an uneventful trip to the Horn. Then
we caught it, and between June 1 and 13
we were driven to the eastward of Staten
Island three times with a succession of
southwest gales. After rounding the
Horn we bad a succession ot heavy gales
to 50 south In the Pacific. On June 24 my
son was born, but what his name will be I
don't know. My wife will settle that mat*
ter when she is able to be about again."
The Muskoka is almost a new vessel and
this is her first trip to San Francisco. She
is rigged as a four-masted bark and pre
sented a very pretty appearance as she
sailed in past the Fort yesterday. At that
point she began taking in sail, and a few
minutes later a redstack tug took hold of
her and towed her to an anchorase.
The water-front thieves are outrivaling
the landsmen. Within the last few days
they have raided a barkentine and robbed
an office. The barkentine Uncle John
was lying at tbe foot of rhird street, and
Sunday night Captain Murchinson and
Chief Officer Trainor went to bed in the
cabin, never dreaming of danger. The
captain left his lamp burning low, but tbe
mate put his out. During the night
thieves broke in and stole everything
movable in the cabin and every stitch of
clothine belonging to the captain and
mate. With the clothing went the sailors'
money and jewelry and everything of
value they possessed. The robbers did
not even spare the captain's and mate's
shoes and stockings, and when the two
men arose yesterday morning they had to
dress in oilskius and rubber boots in order
to reach a clothing-store via the vessel's
agents.
The office of the steamer Point Arena on
Mission-street wharf was also entered.
All that the burglars secured was a valise
and camera belonging to J. B. Ford. Its
value is not known as Mr. Ford has not
been seen since he left his belongings in
the office.
Tbe late whaling cruise of the Queen
has created a regular disturbance on the
water front. Will's office on Commercial
street is watched day and night, but as
the place is closed up and the late man
ager is now out in one of the boats after a
whale, the creditors get little satisfaction.
Hour after hour, hackmen, collectors for
lithographers and printers, restaurant
men and whalers, and the fair typewriters,
who did half the work and all the corre
spondence, come and go, but there is no
sign of the absent manager. Goodall,
Perkins <fe Co. are appealed to, but that
firm repudiates all claims. Bruce, Bowne
& Co. are asked for information, but M.
Bowne says that all they had to do with
the venture was the loaning of some
bombguns and harpoons.
"Our interest in the venture was simply
this," said Edwin Goodall yesterday.
"Mr. Wills came to us and said he had
chartered the steamer Fearless and that
thirty people were going in her at $35 a
head. He asked us to send out the Queen
and give him a percentage on each ticket
sold. This we agreed to do, but when
people came to us and wanted their bills
OK'<l we drew out, and that is all there is
to the matter. We are not responsible for
any bills contracted by Mr. Wills and will
not pay them."
Those who have claims against Wills in
sist that the hunt was advertised as "The
Pacific Coast Steamship Company's Whal
ing Cruise," and say they will look to
Goodall, Perkins <fc Co. for their money.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
Acapulco arrived from Panama yesterday
with twelve cabin and twenty-four steer
age passengers. Among the former was
Ed Cramp, late engineer on the City of
Panama, and John Rooney, late purser on
the same vessel. Both gentlemen left the
vessel at Panama, and their explanations
of the change are as follows: Rooney says
he came back on account of sickness, aud
Cramp says his six months' contract was
up and that he was tired of the job. Man
ager Schwerin says nothing.
The British tramp steamer Strathgarry

Honolulu. All the company's steamers
from Hongkong are to touch at that point
and it is necessary to have a full supply
there. The Aztec will take down over

THE SALTING OF A MINE
Francis Heurtevant Thinks He
Was Swindled in a Placer
Purchase.
Some Gravel That Was Said to Pan
Out $8000 Per Acre Proved
Disappointing.
Francis Heurtevant brought suit in the
Superior Court yesterday against John D.
C. Day and Theodore Begel and the Bank
of California, charging the first two parties
named with fraud in a mining transaction
in which Heurtevant was the victim. Ac
cording to the allegations made Day and
Begel sold to Heurtevant two tracts of
land, one containing seventy acres and the
other fifty-one acres, one known as the
Hike Hill placer mine and the other the
Happy Home placer mine, for which he
(Heurtevant) agreed to pay $50,000. The
sura of $12,500 was put up and the balance
was to be paid in installments of $9500 each,
the next payment being due in Sep
tember.
Day and Begel represented to Heurte
vant that they had mined two and a half
acres of the property, and that it realized
$8000 per acre. The deed was placed in
escrow with the Bank of California, and
Heurtevaut entered into possession aud
put up improvements costing $11,000. He
worked the mine and got less than $2000
per acre.
He alleges a belief that the defendants,
Day and Begel, took bullion from other
mines and placed it in the property they
offered for sale.
The plaintiff alleges that he has lost
much by the transaction; he does not wisu
to pay the amount due, but asks for judg
ment for the sum paid, or that $25,000 be
fixed as the amount due from him for the
property and no more.
An injunction was asked for restraining
the Bank of California from making any
disposition of the deed. It was granted
by Judee Troutt. The mines referred to
are in Trinity County.

THE FAIR CASE,
Denounces Procrastination
and Urges an Early
Trial.
WHEELER'S POINTS BAD.
He Demurs on Common Law
Grounds Now Obsolete in
Pleading.
MRS. CKAVEN TO TESTIFY SOON
After a Hearing on Technical Points
the Case Is Continued Until
Friday.
The many attorneys in the famous Fair
will contest had another inning before
Judge Slack yesterday. Messrs. Charles
Wheeler, Eusseil Wilson and Reuben H.
Lloyd vigorously assaulted the position
taken by ex- Judge Van R. Paterson,
Judge Slack took the entire matter under
advisement and Attorney Delmas made a
stirring speech on the evils of procrasti
nation, after which the case was continued
until 10 a. M. Friday.
The principal matter for hearing was
Attorney Wheeler's demurrer to the
fourth amended opposition of ex-Judge
Paterson, but before it was taken up the
taking of Mrs. Craven's deposition was
continued until next Monday.
Before the arguments on demurrer took
place the semi-annual account of the ad
ministrators of the estate was tiled, agreed
upon and allowed. It showed cash on
hand, $382,288 45; receipts. $269,110 23;
disbursements, $274,004 53, and a debit bal
ance of $4894 30 for trie period. Cash on
hand on December 31 was $386,983 70.
The proceedings proper began when ex-
Judge Paterson moved to strike out all of
the principal parts of Attorney Wheeler's
demurrer on the ground that they em
braced matters ot defense rather than
things that could be offered on demurrer.
His speech on this was very brief, consist
ing chiefly of a bare statement of his poÃi
tion.
Attorney Wheeler went into an elabor
ate argument to show that toe trust will,
under which the minor heirs are inter
ested, ought to have been set forth in full;
that the common law demurrer has not
been narrowed by the code so as to ex
clude its scope in behalf of litigants de
siring to save expense and bring issues to
a focus. He held that there is no section
of the code that maintains the position
taken by Attorney Paterson. He cited a
number of New York decisions and some
oid California interpretations to uphold
his view. When he had finished Judge
Slack forbade further argument and made
an impromptu decision dissenting from
the views of Attorney Wheeler and hold
ing that the common law views of plead
ing no longer hold good.
The main points ot thedemurrer, asking
that the opposition be made more specific,
were then argued and taken under ad
visement.
Attorney Delmas then arose and made
a brief speech in deprecation of the in
excusable delay that has characterized the
case, stating that the procrastination of
eighteen months past has Deen a shame.
"The issues are joined," he said, "and
why do not you gentlemen abolish the
senseless refinements of pleading, and
meet on some broad and equitable ground ?
Our rights ought not to be eternally post
poned by the conduct of ostensible friends.
"I shall be ready within twenty-lour
hours to meet any proposition that arises,
and I plead for expedition in this case. I
want the case of Angus against Craven to
be tried, and I affirm that every attorney
here ought to abandon these refinements
of pleading and get to work. Since you
have all admitted the genuineness of the
will offered, why do you not meet the
whole world manfully and boldly on the
proposition?"
Judgo Slack and all the attorneys com
mended the spirit of the speech and said
they would do all they could to carry it.

NEW HOME OF
THE OCCIDENTALS
In the Big Pavilion of the
Old Woodward's
Gardens.
IT IS A GREAT ARENA.
Fitted Up So As to Comfortably
Seat Five Thousand
People.
OPENS NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT.
Pig Joe McAuliffe and Sprigtly J.-e
Choynski Will Christen
the Ring.
Joe Choynski and Joe McAuliffe will
meet on Friday night in the best appoint
ed arena controlled by any athletic organ
ization in this country. It is the old pa
vilion, formerly the main feature of the
late Woodward's Gardens.
When that once wonderful private park,
a landmark every bit as celebrated as the
Cliff House is to-day, was disintegrated
by an order of court to satisfy the heirs of
the Woodward estate, who clamored for
a distribution of the profits, the old pa
vilion fell to the possession of Mrs. Drury
Melone, one of the daughters. That lady's
husband had the building wired for elec
trical lighting purposes, and by means of
his own dynamo the building is illumi
nated by two powerful arc lights and 2000
incandescent lights. This is in addition
to seven "sunburst" gas chandeliers.
The Occidental Athletic Club has leased
the building for one year, and the place
will be opened for the first time with the
Choynski-McAuliffe eight-round go, the
ten-round mill between Gus Herget and
Spider Kelly and the six-round affair be
tween young Cuneo and Fowler next Fri
day.
The new arena is second only to that of
the New Orleans Athletic Club, which,
however, has been closed for many
months. Allowing for the eight-foot aisles
throughout the place there is a seating
capacity of nearly 5000, every seat being
one of vantage. It is in this pavilion that
the French people held their reunions cel
ebrating the fete of the 14th of July. On
these occasions it was not unusual to see
a gathering of 15,000 people within the
precincts of the pavilion.
The 24-foot ring is in the center of the
hall, and in one corner, elevated beyond
everybody else, the time-keepers have a
stand next to the old clock used years ago
when the California Athletic Club was the
first and foremost in its line. This clock
works so as to record every minute of
fighting and strikes at the conclusion of
every round like it strikes when the round
is to begin.
Choynski has been doing moat of his
training in the basement of his home, but
in the afternoon he usually puts in an
hour or so at the Olympic Club. Joe has
never been in better condition than he is
in right now. He scales 165 pounds, but
hopes to put on live pounds more. He is
more active than he was when he and Cor
bett met, and in view of the fact that he
has to go against such weight as McA'liffe
will show he wants to get into the m: o as
heavy as he possibly can. â 
McAuliffe will enter the ring at about
223 pounds. The big fellow, under the
tutelage of his old friend, Barney Farley,
has been training most faithfully, but it is
a bard thing for him to reduce. Each day
he takes on three sparring partners in
succession besides a ten-mile run along
the ocean beach. This exercise and an
hour or two of handball playing is the full
measure of his work.
The next bout oi importance, next Fri
day, will be for the liehl-weight cham

FATHER YORKE
ON MARRIAGE.
The Catholic Champion De
fines and Defends
the Rite.
THE CHURCH GUARDS IT
Declares Catholics Look Upon
Protestant Nuptials as
Valid.
DIVORCE SAPPING SOCIETY.
Praise for the Editor of "The Call."
Rabbi Levy's Vigorous
Words.
Rev. Father Peter C. Yorke traveled all
over the subject of marriage last night at
Metropolitan Temple, and covered consid
erable more ground of current local inter
est. It was the first of a series of lectures
to be delivered by him under the auspices
of the American Women's Liberal
League.
The name of the league was hung in let
ters of red and gold across the front of
the pipe organ. There was not a vacant
teat in the temple, from the topmost row
in the gallery to the front row on the main
floor.
Applause greeted Father Yorke's ap
pearance on the platform. When he arose
to speaK repeated bursts of applause pre
vented him beginning his address for
nearly a minute.
Seated on the platform with the speaker
were Rev. Fathers P. E. Mulligan, P.
Scanlan, P. J. Cummins, T. Carraher,
Gannon, Ernile Gente, I. Cuelen, Egan,
McKinnon, O'Connor, J. F. Nugent, Do
herty, Harrington, Barrigan, Lamb, Dris
coll, O'Ryan, McGuirp, Lyons, P. Curry,
M. Slattery of Napa and Hughes of Port
land, Or.
â¢â The Star Spangled Banner" was im-
Sressively sung by Miss Catharine Black,
abbi M. S. Levy introduced the speaker.
In his introductory remarks he paid a
high tribute to the aims and worÂ£ of the lo
cal American Women's .Liberal Leacue and
-said these women had "made it possible
for the rabbi and the priest to join hands
for the common good of humanity and
the community in which they live." [Ap
piause.j He referred to the same plat
form and house having been occupied by
" organized bands which would put father
against son and brother against brother."
He said those organized bands which
plotted in secret were now almost swept
away. As "eternal vigilance is the price
of liberty" he admonished all liberal
minded men and women to watch, "that
freedom must be preserved, guaranteeing
to you and me the right of serving God as
we understand him. " He said the estab
lishment of the independence of this na
tion was bathed in the blood of martyrs,
and that the denomination to which Father
Yorke belongs had given its lull quota of
soldiers for the honor and perpetuity of
the flag " which we have just sung,"
The rabbi said the organized bands had
been taught a lesson they were not likely
to torset. Out of their ranks had come
mischief, and more than mischief.
Saying he needed little introduction,
Kabbi Levy introduced Father Yorke.
His subject was, "The Catholic Church
snd Protestant Marriages."
"Ladies and gentlemen," said the
Epeaker, "the chairman of the evening has
kindly reminded us of the last time we
were together in this hall under the
auspices of tbe American Woman's Lib
eral League. He was chairman of the
last meeting of tbe first series, and he is
chairman of the first meeting of the sec
ond series, ana it is significant to those
who believe this: the bond that was then
shown to exist between men of all creeds
in favor of religious liberty, even between
rabbi and priest, still remains unbroken,
and, please God, will remain unbroken to
the end.
"He has done me the honor â doubtful
honor â of referring to the broom and to
my words concerning the same, and he
Lias proved that I am not a prophet nor
the son of a prophet by asserting that that
same broom swept a certain organization
into tbe graveyard of impossibilities.
"I have great respect for the rabbi's
judgment, and I am very sorry to differ
from him even in this, for I am" forced to
say that the weaDon that accomplised this
was not a broom but a club. [Laughter
and applause.]
"And in the beginning as a kind of
prelude I might say that these meetings
have been instrumental in putting that
club into our hands. You understand
that a campaign such as has been carried
on lor the last three or four months re
quires what are called the sinews ol war,
and tbe fund which came from the
American Women's Liberal League meet
ing has been well and wisely expended in
the end which has been so signally ac
complished. And I am proud that -to
them we owe the means by which we have
been able to split that organization up the
back; by means of which we have been
able to throw its secret council chambers
wide open to the public; by which we have
been able to cast upon it, not an X ray, but
a searchlight showing tbe scoundrels
quarreling over the chickens before they
were hatched.
"There is, ladies and gentlemen, a great
difference in the public mind concerning
this society which has been organized to
save the country from the Pope since the
last time we met here. Then, as a very
vigorous writer said, that society appeared
to have the world by the tail on a down
grade. There was nothing that was im
possible to it, and its voice was lifted up,
even as the wild ass's, proclaiming 'the
world is ours.'
"The different political conventions had
their meetings, and the Republican con
vention snubbed them, and worse than all
or. the strength of a telegram from Arch
bishop Ireland. Then the Democrats met
and they also are saio. to have snubbed
them, and so it went on. They were like
Japhet looking for a father, but as we
Know no one wished to father either.
"And after they had conspired to sell
out their votes for the sum of $50,000 â it is
wonderful what hankerings they have for
$50 000â their secretary also bad a liking
ior J50,000, and the gentleman who lost his
from teet.i also values them at $50,000.
After they had conspired from the end of
last year to effect this sale for this sum of
money, which would have enabled them
to live in happiness and comfort in the
South Sea Islands, and after they had
made a jxreat pretense of haying made a
deal with a prominent politician and of
having mit a padlock on a great news
paperj the cold silence wa3 broken. The
proprietor of that paper spoke out like a
man and proclaimed that lie was in favor
of religious freedom and opposed to such
organizations as these scoundrels repre
sented and tried to sell.
"And further than that, the editor of
The Call has come out in the columns of
his paper to proclaim that elementary
principle, that he is in favor of the consti
tution. Thi?, I consider, is one of the
most encouraging signs of the times. It
tells us tbat tbe peopie are awake on this
mbject; that the people are no longer to
be bamboozled; that the men who claim
to be public men must put themselves
lairly and squarly on record in regard to
the constitution if they hope for public suf
frape.
"This is prelude No. 1. Prelude No. 2,
as the story papers say, is to be continued
in our next.
"Yesterday this hall was filled to the
extent of seventy-five seats, aud ihe gen
tleman from Seattleâ all the wayâ by the
name of Fleenor, held out on the public
schools as the palladium of American
liberties. As my next lecture will be de
voted to the little red schoolnouse, I do
not mean to take up your time by a
prelude on that subject.
"When a society whose head is a man
whose name is not fit to be mentioned
amons: decent people, whose record is to
be found in the under world, whose past |
life is a hideous and black shadow â
when a society can stand a man like
that at its head; when a meeting
which is organized for the purpose of good
citizenshiD can have as one of it? most
prominent members a man who within
two years has been in jeopardy before the
courts of this City, a man who has been
accused twice in twelve months of swind
ling a client â when an organization with
such a record as that can come before the
public, it does not deserve that the public
should note what its orators say. And so
what Fleenor or Goodwin or Case or Dille
or the rest of them say, would not be
answered il it were not tiiat we have made
it our policy to answer every charge made
against us. No matter whence il comes,
the charge receives a certain dignity
because it is made against a great church.
"At my next lecture I will take great :
pleasure and great satisfaction in replying !
to Rev. Mr. Fleenor, who has come all the
way from Seattle to preserve San Fran
cisco from the Jesuits and the Pope. The
subject of the lecture this evening is 'The
Catnolic Church on Protestant Marriages.'
About a month ago I happened to be go
ing north by water and I met a physician
of this City who began to speak about the
controversy. I must confess he did not
have a good opinion of the controversy.
He said he did not believe in this contro
versy, but added that a number of people
had spoken to Him about it. Now among
the statements ttiat have been given cur
rency is one that Archbishop Riordan had
declared that tho lives of Protestant j
wives were those of concubines. This
statement was first invented and first
made public by the late unlamented
Frank Pixley. His cinders are now
stowed away in their own place, but the lie
which he started, like John Brown'ssoul, '
keeps still marching on. And so, from I
time to time from this platform and from
other places in the newspapers and peri
odicals we find it stated as Catholic teach
ings that no Protestant can be properly
I married unless he gets the priest's hands
j above him and the priest's hands in his
pocsets.
"This calumny is one which I am afraid
is believed. The gentleman of whom I
spoke to you was a physician and a man
of education, yet when the matter was put
to him he could not deny that he believed
it. It is a calumny which strikes at the
hearl of our Protestant fellow-citizens. It |
I is a calumny which grieves them and em
bitters them. You remember that in the
old times the controversy between the
Catholic and the Protestant was confined
to such subjects as transubstantiation,
validity of orders, auricular confession
and such subjects. They cannot raise
hatred and cannot raise prejudice by i
confining themselves to these dry matters,
so instead of that doctrines have been
i brought forth which, if true, will excite
I men's minds against people of a certain
! denomination and embitter their hearts.
You know in this country the people, like
those of other countries, are patriotic and
proud of the land of their birth, and so
these men who would stir up hatred and
prejudice try to make it appear that the
Catholic church is opposed to that patri
otic sentiment, is opposed to the best in
terests of the country, and then by mis
representing the Catholic church it turns
against her all the patriotism and love of j
country in the human breast.
"They take up the supremacy of the
Pope, the relations of church and state,
and try to make it appear to the world
that the Catholics cannot be good citizens, j
and because they are not good citizens
they should be deprived of the rights of
citizens. They try to enlist against the
Catholic church that beautiful spirit that j
makes a man proud of his wife and chil- |
dren, that love which lifts him np to be I
almost godlike, and to make it appear that
the Catholic church comes to the door of
his home and hoots down his wife as lower
than a woman of the town.
"You know how we felt when these
scoundrels spoke of Catholic women â you !
know the feelings that were in our breasts i
anO|the breasts ot all decent men. The same |
feeling that is intended to affect in the j
breasts of Protestant men when they re
peat this calumny.
"I say, ladies and gentlemen, that if we
Catholics approve such a doctrine, if we
talk it behind locked doors, behind closed
windows, in secret chambers, and if we
even thought it, we would not be nt to be
citizens of this great republic.
"In order that you may be able not only
to deny the calumny, but to give the rea
sons why it is not so, I intend to devote
this evening to explanations, to the law of
the church concerning marriages in gen
eral and Protestant marriages in particu
lar. You will excuse me if this explana- I
tion is dry, for it will treat of the legal |
aspects from the canon law side, as this is â 
the only side I wish to talk upon to-night.
"I remember once asking a small boy in j
the catechism class, 'What are the effects I
of the sacrament of marriage?' and he
answered me without moving a muscle,
'The effects of the sacrament of marriage
are to darken the understanding, a weak
ness of will and a great inclination to
evil.'
"I have no doubt that he heard all about
it at home, so 1 never questioned his ac
curacy, and I don't intend to question it j
now. I merely intend to confine myself i
j to the legal question to sbow what the j
I Catholic church holds in regard to niar-
I riage. In the first place, the Catholic
j church believes that marriage is a con
tract.
After the speaker had explained that a
contract is an agreement between two or
more parties to do a certain thing for a
certain compensation, he continued sub
stantially as follows:
"The Catholic church regards marriage
as a contract. Perhaps there Is no con
tract that is of more importance to the
community than the contract of marriage.
Each nation has its form of marriage, from
the savage who courts with a cudgel and
i carries his wife off on horseback, to the
modern ceremony of courtesying before a
Justice of the Peace and the thing is
done.
"If two persons agree to live together as
husband and wife there is nothing to pre
vent it being binding. This was so in this
State up to two years ago, and it was the
case in the Catholic church between the
thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. But
it became here almost unsafe for a man
who had any regard for his character to
die. Three or four widows were likely to
dispute the rieht of weeping over his re
mains. Tho Catholic church in the six
teenth century had to do what California
did in the nineteenth century. The law
was abolished. Then all legislation on
marriage was in thÂ« hands of the church.
"The council of Trent," contin
| ued Father Yorke, "was petitioned
to compel marriage in the presence of
witnesses, and the Council of Trent nniae
it so that marriage should be celebrated
before the parish priest and at least two
witnesses. The State of California now
requires that it shall be public and in the
presence of witnesses. But the action of
the Council of Trent was accepted by the
people only with the understanding that
the decision should be promulgated by
the priests a certain number of times in
each parish before it went into effect,
and that it should not have any effect in
parishes where it was not so promulgated.
"The question arises, Does the law of the
Council of Trent bind in this country?
In France and Spain and other Catholic
countries the law was generally promul
gated. The Spanish settled this State,
and the law of Trent binds here for that
reason; but outside, for instance, in the
Biate of Oregon, which was not settled by
the Spanish, it <iocs not bind.
"Pope Benedict XIV modified this
law," Father Yorke continued, "so that it
applied to Catholics and not to Protest
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 1896.
ants; that in mixed marriaees, where one
party was a Catholic and the other a
Protestant, it did not apply; and ho re
stored contract marriage. If Catholics
marry in secret, or a Protestant and a
Catholic marry, the church feels that it is
sinful, but that does not affect the validity
of the marriage. If Protestants get
married the Catholic church looks on the
marriage as valid if the marriage contract
is valid. The Catholic church does not
consider that Protestants are bound by
the Council of Trent.
"But you will not find a Catholic saying
anything against being married by a
priest and getting the blessing of God on
the union. Protestants do not believe that
marriage is a sacrament; Catholics do.
Wnen two persons agree to marry they
are the ministers of the sacrament. We
eive them an honor higher than which it
is not in our power to bestow.
"We look upon them as one of the seven
seals from which flows the fountain of
life. Ido not think Protestants have any
particular grievance on the way we look
on their marriages. We look upon them
as valid, and as the Protestants them
selves do not as a sacrament."
The speaker gave what he declared was
the true story of the marriage of Jerome
Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, in this
country to Miss Patterson of Philadelphia,
to refute the charge that gold and high
position found a way for divorce in
thj Catholic church. He read a
letter written by Napoleon to Pope
Pius asking an annulment of the mar
riage, and read the refusal of the Pope to
do so, saying that the American girl had
a champion at Rome for her womanhood
and the legitimacy of her children, for
"what God hath joined together let no
man put asunder." Though disapproved
of by the church, the marriage was ac
knowledged as valid.
He read a letter from Martin Luther to
the Landerave of Hesse approving polyg
amy by the Landgrave and sugcestinjt the
greatest secrecy in the matter of the
Princelet taxing a second wife, ard made
a pointed reference to Revs. Dille, Case
and Goodwin in this connection.
He said also: "Luther was the origin
ator of that famous saying, which has
been appropriated by the Southern Pacific
Company, 'The public be .' He
begged the blessing of God on polygamy,
and this reminds me of the preachers get
ting down on this platform and asking the
blessing of God on religious strife."
He said polygamy was not permitted in
the marriage contract, and that the church
believed that divorce was permissible only
on Scriptural grounds, where a Protestant
husband refuses to live with a Catholic
wife or vice versa, by reason of hatred of
her religion. Children , were not able to
provide for themselves until parents were
well along in years, and this was a reason
from nature against divorce.
He declared it a shame that divorce
could be secured in this and many other
States for almost any cause, and he hoped
that a public sentiment would grow up
that would put an end to such divorce
mills as South Dakota and Oklahoma.
Replying to John S. Etell, he said the
Catholic Church looks upon Jewish mar
riages as real, true marriages. Hi said in
this connection that the Argonaut re
spects the truth just as the good house
wife respects hes front roomâ she seldom
uses it.
Other denominations, particularly the
Episcopalian, did not approve divorce
except for Scriptural cause, and the
speaker said he did not see why they were
not included in the same anathemas as
the Catholics.
"Divorce is sapping the foundation of
society," he said. "If it goes on as it has,
I fear the time will come when the family
will become extinct. Upon the home and
marriage tie depend the future of this
country. Within the home is set the tree
of life. To be the daughter of an Ameri
can citizen is greater than to be called a
queen. If we cannot raise good children
we cannot raise good citizens."
In a few closing remarks Rabbi Levy
said that during the last twenty-five years
he had performed 1200 marriage cere
monieÃ, and that not one in 100 of thia
number bad sought divorce. This was
because the domestic tie was regarded by
the Jews as sacred, and marriage as
founded in the doctrines of the Bible is a
divine institution.
THE PEBBLE BEACH WAR
District Attorney Walker of San Blateo
County to Be Cited for Contempt

A skirmish of the famous Pescadero
Pebble Beach war, which has been gome
on for years, recently took place at .that
town before a Justice Court. . â¢. :
The widow of the late Matthias Gray of
this City having been ordered off ' the
beach, where she had been discovered
picking up jasper, agate and cornelian
stones by Lorin Coburn, the owner, drew
a revolver on him with a threat that if he
opened his mouth she would put a bullet
through him. r â .. . 'â â -
Coburn had her arrested for trespass and
also for the pistol exploit. Ex-Senator
John L. Boone of - this City conducted the
prosecution, and Attorney Noyes, also of
San Francisco/defended Mrs. Gray. Dis
trict 1 Attorney Walker ;h of San Mateo
County moved to dismiss the case upon
the ground: that the defendant had used
the qualifying word "it" in her threat and
also that the public had a right to go upon
Pebble Beach whenever they choose to
do so. :;
The Justice immediately dismissed the
case, and the entire courtroom not only
cheered the decision, but the people in the
street came near . mobbing Coburn and
Boone. . i : ;;â  . . â  V â ' :/â¢-; â  , â ,".;â  'â --â -,â

Pescadero cited to appear before the Fed

should not be punished for contempt of

the servants' quarters at the Baldwin
Hotel and a burglar climbed up the fire
escape at the St. Nicholas Hotel and
stole two gold watches and some papers
from the room of C. F. Capp.
A few nights ago a sneakthief got into
the room of J. Whiteley, a salesman for
W. P. Fuller & Co., in the Marechal Niel
Hotel, 404 Ellis street, and stole a few dol
lars out of his pocket while he was asleep.
Another curious case was reported as
having occurred at the Berkshire, 711
Jones street. Miss Martin of Stockton is
boarding there and she, her sister, a nurse
and child all slept in the same suite of
rooms.
Early yesterday morning Miss Martin
says a man climbed up the fire escape and
entered her room by the window. She was
the only one awake. He presented a revol
ver at her head and demanded her money.
She gave him her purse containing |4, and
was taking off her rings, when the man
said he did not want jewelry and backed
out of the window again. The police look
upon her story with suspicion and say
that she id troubled with hallucinations,
as it would be impossible to reach the win
dow of her room from the fire escape.
Destitute Englishmen abroad can||de

to captains of ships about to sail. '

A UNIVERSAL
SEAMEN'S STRIKE,
Report That the Sailors of
the World Will Walk
Out
COMMERCE AT ANCHOR.
The Pacific Coast Union Secre
tary Denies the State
ment
NO STEIKE IN AMERICAN PORTS
Mr. Furuseth Claims That the Move
ment Will Surely Take Place
in Europe.
A telegraphic dispatch yesterday morn
ing from New York stated that prepara
tions had been made for a strike of seamen
and longshoremen all over the world for
better wages and better treatment in deep
water ships. It was also stated that An
drew Furuseth, secretary of the Pacific
Coast Seamen's Union, had been in con
sultation with the secretaries of the
Atlantic and European seamen's and
longshoremen's unions, and a universal
strike the first of next year was agreed
upon.
Mr. Furuseth, when interviewed yester
day by a Call reporter, stated that the
dispatches were incorrect as far as the
United States was concerned, but a great
movement of that character was contem
plated in Great Britain and in Continental
maritime countries.
"Not that Jack is any better off or more
satisfied with his lot in this country," said
tho secretary, "but there are other things
to be attempted fifst before the men of
American ships join a universal strike.
"We are trying legislation, and 1 think
much will be done in Congress for the
sailor, and his condition made less unbear
able."
"Are European seamen worse treated?"
was asked Mr. Furusetti. .
"No; but American vessels have the
monopoly of belaying-pin soup, boot
heel stew and handspike liniment for
bruises. The British and Continental
ships overwork and starve their crews,
but they do not club them to death
with tbe frequency of the Yankee ship.
In regard to the robbing of sailors
by captains, crimps, boarding-masters ana
shipping-masters, the crime goes on just
the same in every port on earth. In the
United States the Maguire act has
knocked out the advance system, but they
manage to get around the poor sailor all
the same."
"Should the movement in Europe be
successful will it not 6pread to this coun
try?"
"I think not; that is, not in the sense of
a general strike here. You see there are
so few American ships compared to the
great fleets of Great Britain and the Conti
nent. Every English, German or French
vessel is manned by natives, and they sail
in and out of the same port for years.
They belong to their home unions and gen
erally keep up their membership with the
institution. On the other hahd, every
body sails in our ships, and in such a cos
mopolitan crowd there can be no union
nor agreement, I refer to the deep
water people, not the coasters. If
the bucko American first mate
could be suppressed and some of the
crimes choked out of existence so that the
sailor could have a fighting chance for
life more Americans would go to sea, and
then we would have a different class of
men aboard our vessels.
"A sailor strike under any conditions is
a safe proposition, because if it succeeds
Jack's chances are a little improved, and
if it fails he can't be any worse off. He
won't be robbed any more ashore nor
abused any more at sea for his blunders.
Well, a universal strike is not, far out of
the bounds of possibility. The saiior is
par taking of the advancement of the ages
and, notwithstanding his hard, brutaliz
ing and unfavorable surroundings, he is
gaining a little knowledge and beginning
to contrast his wretched life with the
better conditions of other toilers. The
crushed worm is commencing to turn. A
gmat strike would tie many a ship up
at the dock or at her anchor. Ship-own
ers might man their vessels with coolies
and creatures low down in the scale of
humanity. They do it now when the
sailor proper asks for living wages; but
what if the longshoremen all over the
globe would strike? Take Liverpool,
where the great merchant fleets tro in
and out. Suppose the dock people there
should refuse to touch a pound of cargo.
Such may soon be the case there, for the
British seamen are coming to that point.
"Their principal grievance is the system
of robbery practiced by Vbe shipping com
missioners and English Consuls on the
Continent, by wbom thousands and thou
sands of English seamen are worked out
of their vessels annually that cheaper men
may be shipped in their places. In the
Seamen's Chronicle, the principal mari
ners' journal published in Great Britain,
I recently saw the statement that Ant
werp has three shipping masters who
make from Â£3000 to Â£4000 yearly apiece in
fees. At Rotterdam there are four who
earn the same. In Hamburg there are
two shipping-masters wbo charge from 10
shillings to Â£1 each for shipping a man in
an English vessel, and as 20,000 sailors are
engaged in that port yearly it is left for
the reader to calculate how enorrr.ous are
the sums squeezed out of poor Jack. The
same journal openly accuses the English
Consuls on the Continent of assisting in
the plundering of their countrymen.
"The result is that the unions are grow
ing in membership every day, and the day
may not be far distant when an inter
national union of seamen will be in ex
istence and in activity all over the world.
The deep-water sailor in Great Britain
must have more than $14 per month as
wages for his hard and dangerous calling,
and his brother in America must have
more than $17 50. Legislation must step
in and protect him from the banditti of
the water front or the fleets of tbe world
will rust at their anchors.
"How did this all come about? Once
men from all classes went to sea. It was an
honorable calling. It was so regarded by
men ashore, and boys sought it as a means
of adventure or travel and of promotion
sought it and were proud of it. The laws
that governed the seamen sat lightly on
them; the harsh features of the Jaw were
seldom called into execution and existed
more in tradition than in reality. The
crew and officers hailed from the same
town or village, and, being equal at home,
there was discipline without cruelty and
obedience without fear. As the profits
grew smaller through competition it was
found that the existing law lent itself
easily to lowering the standard of living,
and to extract from the sailor the largest
portion of his wages as he had contracted
for, either by compelling him to become a
deserter or by overcharges on goods
needed by the men and kept by thrifty
masters for sale on board. As natives ob
jected and refused to accept the lower
standard, the crimping system came into
operation. Some obliging lodging or
boarding-house keeper undertook to fur
niah men for outgoing vessels on condi
tion that a certain amount of the sea
man's waees should be turned over to him
for his Services to the seamen. Men
were sent to sea without any previous
training; able seamen had to do their
work. The officers could not get the same
amount of labor out of a smaller number
of men that could previously be per
formed by a greater number, better
skilled, and so 'driving' and brutality
came into use to make the conditions
still worse. ,
"Finally arose the present customs and
habits, which the law was but too well
adapted to nourish, the courts too willing
to sustain and the sailor himself too weak
to resist, except by desertion, which, after
all, meant but going from one bad vessel
to another, leaving his wages and nis
clothing behind him. When men could not
be found in any other way to man the ves
vels the press gang was used and men were
drugged to be placed on board, or simply
forced, on board. To stop this the so-called
Shipping Commissioner's act was enacted.
But the Commissioners' salary was made
dependent on the number of men shipped,
thus giving to ship-owners the power to cut
the Commissioners' salary in two aud
placing them under the thumb of the very
men whose previous conduct had caused
their appointment. Tbe sailor, starved,
overworked and beaten on board and robbed
while on shore, gradually went into other
employment, until the standard of effi
ciency got so low that the lack of skill and
discipline was used as an argument in fa
vor of continuing the system which had
produced the existing conditions.
"And this is the answer."
WILLIAM BOSTWICK CURTIS.
MB, CURTIS WILL RESIGN
His Resignation to Be Presented
to the Traffic Association
To-Morrow.
Some of the Things He Accomplished
for tbe Extension of
Commerce.
W. B. Curtis will tender his resignation
as traffic manager of the Traffic Associ
ation of California at the meeting of tbat
body to-morrow.
Mr. Curtis has occupied this position
less than a year, and left the employ of
the Southei-- Pacific Company to accept
it. The reason of his severine his connec
tion with the Traffic Association is that
he is to form a partnership with another
gentleman, well and favorably known in
this City, for tne purpose of representing
a number of the largest and best firfns of
San Francisco in Japan, in order to
extend the commercial relations be
tween this City and tbe Land of the Ris
ing Sun.
Negotiations with the various local firms
to be represented by Mr. Curtis, who will
make Yokohama his headquarters, while
his partner will remain here, are not yet
completed, but are sufficiently advanced
to warrant Mr. Curtis in taking the pro
posed action mentioned.
Overtures to this effect were made to
Mr. Curtis some time ago. He took the
matter under careful consideration, and it
is now learned from one of the firms
which he will represent that he is ready to
enter upon the new departure.
Among the lines of goods that the new
firm of international brokers will under
take to handle are lumber, paints and oils,
provisions, hardware, agricultural imple
ments, rubber goods and wines and
liquors.
Mr. Curtis' administration of his office
hes been most successful and has resulted
in considerably extending the business of
the local merchants. His policy was one
that brought the railroad and the mer
chants together for the common good of
both, instead of antagonizing them to one
another. His idea was that by inducing
shipper and transportation company to
co-operate in the efforts to extend the
commerce of San Francisco better and
prompter results would be achieved, and
the history of the past nine months
demonstrated the value of his work car
ried out on this line.
Among the things accomplished through
his efforts were reductions over the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad, which made compe
tition possible in Utah for local merchants
where it had not been so before; the re
duction of the tea rate out of San Fran
cisco; the reduction on lumber and shin
gles from Eureka, Cal., to points west of
the Rockies, so that the Humboldt Bay
section could compete on equal terms
with the Puget Sound country; and he
has also taken a prominent and energetic
part in endeavoring to secure for San
Francisco a competing iine of steamers to
Japan and other Oriental ports.
None of the board of directors have yet
been officially informed of the purpose of
Mr. Curtis. The position of traffic man
ager is w^rth a tempting salary, and there
are likely to be quite a number of applica
tions for the vacancy as soon as it occurs.
It is believed that matters will be ar
ranged so that Mr. Curtis can leave for
Yokohama about the middle of September.
TETLOW'S MANY WOES.
The liast Link That Bound Him to
Earth Broken by the Death of
His Nephew.
The last link that bound Sam Tetlow to
this world was snapped on Sunday even
ing when Emil Kuenecke, hia nephew,
died suddenly at 502 Washington street at
the age of 19. Tbe boy was a cripple
from his birth and a hunchback, and as he
grew up be was a sufferer from epilepsy
and consumption.
Tetlow is best known as the founder of
of the Bella Union Theater and in those
days he made a fortune, although his
daily expenditures ran from $500 to $1000.
He owned the Sutro Heights and other
property in ihe City and was happy and
prosperous when the shadow that -ruined
his life crossed his path. His partner,
Seantlebury, became too assiduous in his
attentions to his wife and Tetlow shot him.
It took all his wealth to eet him out of
the trouble and while in jail he sold the
heights to Sntro.
In those dark days the boy Kueneckt's
parents died, and Tetlow took chferge of
the boy and his brother. He lavished ail
his affection upon the little cripple, and
his boyish talk was the only happiness he
experienced within the past few years.
Yesterday the old man sat all day in
the undertaker's beside the coffin of the
boy as if in atrance and refused to be
comforted. The funeral of the boy will
take place this morning at Odd Fellows'
Cemetery, where the remains of Mrs. Tet
low and the boy's parents and brothe- are
laid.

MINISTERS' REGULAR MEETING
Ssveral Origiml Papers Read en
Current Issues in the
Religious World.
Although the papers read before the
various ministerial organizations yester
day were as sparkling and oiiginal as
heretofore, there were at least two meet
ings where the hearts of the pastors, as
evinced by their countenances, were
rather gloomy. The cause was the de
parture from this field of two of its most
learned and painstaking laborers, namely,
Key. W. S. Kovard of the Methodist and
Rev. Mr. Fluwith of the Congregational
fold.
Following is the resolution offered by
the Methodists on account of the depart
ure of their brother:
ffmtltm, We iearn with pleasure and profit
that out brother, W. 8. Bovard, is scon to leave
us for a term oi smdy in the Boston Univer
sity, we wish to assure him that it gives us
)<'uasure to know he can enjoy sucii an oppor
tunity for study, and yei we regret that he is
to be absent irom us;
'i erf. That ive commend Brother Bovard
to those among whom he is to live, and will
pray for the health of himself and family and
for his success in his lile-work;
Resolved, Tnat we shall be giad to welcome
Jam, back at any time to the work that he
loves so much and hi which he has been emi
nently successful.

Dr. Goodwin reported that fourteen new
members weie received into his church
yesterday, and Rev. Mr. Baker of Epworth
Churc!) reported receiving twenty-four.
Rev. Mr. t-imester and "wife, lately irom
Drew, were introduced and spoke on mis
sionary work in China, to which place
tliey are going shortly.
Rev. S. W. Beatty read a review of
Brusus' '"Paul's Conception of Chris
tianity," which was favorably discussed
by Drs. Goodwin, Calli?, Carroll, Briggs,
Vrniy, Kummers, Thompson, Case,
Pearce, Matthews and Simmons, and was
closed by the essayist himself.
The cause of the Preachers' Mutual Aid
Asaociation was abiv presented by Dr.
Wythe.
At '.he Congregational Monday Club
Rev. S. L. Rathbone read a paper on the
"Conuregational Way of Emphasizing
and Promoting Fellowship." His claim
was that when individualism becomes
prominent in church reiations the respon
sibility becomes greater. The different
spirits that actuate church members were
illustrated in tne contentions of the two
great political parties. During his re
marks an indirect reference was made io
the late trouble in the First Congrega
tional Church by stating that ecclesias
tical law alone could not preserve unity,
but that there must be a fellowship of
love.
Rev. Mr. Flawith, pastor of the Green
street church, then arose and stated his
intention of going to England during the
week, and at the ciose of the meeting re
ceived many a brothsrly farewell and
handclaspfrom his brothers m the faitb.
Dr. McLean requested the executive
committee to look into the possibility of
their getting more commodious rooms for
their ilonday meetings.
At the Presbyterian Mission Rev. Dr.
Winton of the San Anselmo Theological
Seminary read a paper on the Pan-Presby
terian Alliance held in Glasgow last June.
He said there were delegates from 100
churches there, representing in all
30,000,000 a.lherents.
As a rule he believed Presbyterians are
pushing their way to the front, but that
satan is ingenious and quickly steals the
inventions of highly developed aces. In!
conclusion he stated that Jesus Christ is
shaking, shaping, movinc and ruling the
worid as never before in spite of its defects
and wickedness.
"In all this," he concluded, "our good
old Presbyterian Galvanism with all its
impressiveness by the grace of God has a
front place."
Dr. Parry followed with a few noteÂ« on
his traveles abroad and especially his visit
to the House of Lords.
The Christian ministers did not hold

RESOURCES OF WILLIAMS
Judge Morrow Rules That They
May Be Legally Inquired
Into.
A Point for the People â Testimony of
the Payment of $85 to De.
fendant.
Judge Morrow of tbe United States Dis
trict Court m&de a ruling yesterday in the
case of the United States vs. Richard S.
Williams, the ex-Chinese Inspector, which
was far from satisfactory to the counsel of
the defendant, and will, so the prosecu
tion claims, aid materially in the estab
lishment of his guilt. Thus far the Gov
ernment has relied principally npon the
testimony of Chinese witnesses, but now,
under the ruling of the court, the way is
open for white witnesses, whose testi
mony is supposed to have more weight
with jurymen than that of the Asiatics.
With the exception of the ruling men
tioned and the testimony of Wong Kew
Kirn the proceedings yesterday were un
eventful, but to-ciay livelier times are ex
pected.
At the morning session Wong Kew Kira.
testified that in the barber-shop, at GOB
Washington street, he had seen Chin Ying
pay to Dick Williams $85 for the landing
of "his (witness 1 ) brother and loaned him
(Chiu Ying) $25 with which to make np
the amount.
A rigid cross-examination by Lyman
Mo wry of counsel for the defendant did
not shake the testimony of the witness
nnd Wong Bara was recalled and gave
some cumnlative testimony for the prose
cution.
In the afternoon Barclay Henley, special
counsel for the Government, recalled Chin
Ying, by whom lie expected to prove a
connection between a Chinese interpreter
and Dick Williams, but the objections of
defendant's counsel to his questions were
Mistained by the court.
"I desire to prove," said Mr. Henley,
"that the salary of Williams was $5 a
day."
"1 foresee," answered Judge Morrow,
"an argument between counsel as to the
admissibility of evidence upon this point
and will accordingly excuse the jury and
the witnesses until 11 A. m. to-morrow
(Tuesday)."
"We wish to show," resumed Mr.
Henley, "that during his employment in
the Government service Williams put
money in bank and acquired real estate,
although his expenditures were fully equal
to his salary arid dcsDite the fact that
when he becamo an inspector he wa3
utterly impecunious and was compelled to
borrow money with which to buy a suit of
ciothe<!. : '
"Williams," answered T. C. Coogan, his
attorney, "is accused of the'unlawful ex
tortion from Chinese of $375. specially as
follows:
September 18, 1835 ...?100
November 19 90
November 6. 85
November 13 100
T0ta1.... $375
"These alleged crimes cover a period of
only a few months of last year and I sub
mit that the testimony counsel seeks to
introduce is altogether irrelevant and im
material. If the sum were thousands in
stead of hundreds it might be admissible,
but as it is we strenuously object to its in
troduction.
"We are prepared to meet all the allega
tions in tbe indictment against our client
and are confident that we can disprove
them, but we do not wish to go outside of
the issues involved in this case."
At the conclusion of the arguments of
counsel, Judge Morrow ruled that the evi
dence was admissible and adjourned court
until 11 o'clock this morning.
OPPOSES INDIAN TRIBES.
Commissioner Browning Would
Have Each Noble Red
Man a Farmer.
Says the City Might Get Mere R?s
ervation Trade for the
Asking.
Ex-Judge D. M. Browning, United
States Commissioner of Indian Affairs, is
here from Washington, D. C, with his
wife and son, on his first visit to the far
West. He will remain in thi3 City until
Wednesday or Thursday, when he will
start for Salem, Or. He purposes to in
spect a number of small Indian schools in
that part of the ccuntry before going to
the Fort Hall reservation, in Idaho, to see
the notorious Bannocks. Afterward, if he
has any time left, he will visit other reser
vations, but his plan is to return to Wash
ington September 15.
For sixteen years previous to April, 1893,
the Commissioner was Judge of the Cif
cuit Court at Benton, 111. He left the
bench to accept his present position,
which in official rank is next to that of
Secretary of the Interior.
All the Indians in the United States ex
cept those of Alaska are under his charge.
Indian treaties, laws of Congress affecting
the Indiana and tbeir land?, the assign
ment of agricultural property and sup
plies of all kinds and the education of In-
Ex-Judge D. M Browning, United States Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Win
Believes in Making Every Indian Earn His Own Living.
dian children are all matters to which the
Commissioner must give careful attention.
"Contrary to the general impression the
Indians are not increasing," said the
Commissioner as he sat in the office of the
Occidental Hotel yesterday with Colonel
John Lane, head oi the local Indian sup
ply warehouse.
â¢ "There are about 250,000 Indians in the
Cnited States, and that is about the same
as the census has shown for the fast
twenty or thirty years. We have 24,000
Indian schoolchildren attending about 250
nchools, some of which are only small
affairs, while there are several boarding
schools attended by from 300 to 800 stu
dents.
"In the last few years the plan of educa
tion has been changed somewhat. We are
enlarging upon the industrial work, the
niechanical training. Instruction is civen
in slioesnops, tinshops barness-shons and
such work, and in farming, gardening and
fruit raising. Practical farmers and me
chanics have been employed as instruct
ors. Fully half tne time is devoted to the
industrial work.
"It is foolish to train Indians for strictly
commercial and mercantile professions
as most otheT children are trained. The
Indian question can be solved by teaching
the Indians to support themselves, to set
tle on land as other people do, and to
maintain their families upon little home
farms.
"I want to see this system of free rations
discouraeed. It puts'a premium on idle
ness. Let the Indian be taught how to
make his own living; let the Government
establish him on a piece of land and fur
nish him with agricultural implements.
But let tribes and chiefs be done away
with and let regular farm life take their
places.
"As to tbe Indian warehouse in San
Francisco it seems to me that the territory
it supplies might easily be enlarged and
that other supplies now furnished by the
New York and Chicago depots might be
added to the list purchased at this place.
The Secretary of the Interior has charge
of such matters. The people could send
letters to him before the annual letting of
supplies, next spring, and make such re
quests."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 1896.
VAN BUSKIRK AND
STELZNER FIGHT
It Will Occur To-Night at
the Grove-Street The
ater.
O'DONNELL'S BOUQUET.
Peppers and Purcell Are Ex
pected to Make Things
Interesting.
MANAGER GIBB'S NEW POSITION
He Is Selected to Take Comple'e
Charge ot the McAuliff>Car
roll Contest.
To-night occurs the long-talked-of mill
between Van Buskirk and Stelzner, and
the sports are going down into their
pockets for the wherewithal necessary to
feast their eyes on what is regarded as a
most interesting bout.
The advance sale of tickets at 900 Mar
ket street yesterday was very large, and
Managers Gibbs and Groom of the Na
tional Club are much elated thereat. To
day it is confidently expected that enough
seats will be sold for the contest to fill the
house to overflowing.
Dr. C. C. O'Dounell, who is accredited
with missing no prizefight of consequence
held in San Francisco since the Dark
Ages, is rumored to have entered a florist's
last evening and left orders for a basket
ful of flowers with which to deck the brow
of the victor. The gentleman in question
denies this, but ad raits that the fight would
amount to nothing without his inspiring
presence.
Van Buskirk is out at the B'i-mile
House putting on the artistic touches
necessary to put him in first-class condi
tion. He is very confident that SteJzner's
star will either shine to-morrow with a
ve-v dim light or be transformed into a
comet and take an erratic course into
interstellar regions out of sight of the
naked public eye.
Sielzner is training with Choynski. He
does no talking whatever, which only adds
another mysterious element to the man's
rather peculiar personality. In the last
few days his admirers have been wagering
pretty heavily on him. Local opinion is
that this contest is goinj: to be a pretty
close one. This excludes Harry W*' son "<
whose faith in his pupil, Van Buskirk, is
as great as Barney Farley's in the "'Mis
sion Giant."
One thing is pretty sure, there is not
likely to be any fouling. The clause in
the agreement added by the National
Club that any man striking in a break
away shall be deemed guilty of a foul
will," it is contended, do much for the
cause of clean fighting.
The second mill will be between Harry
Peppers and Frank Purcell. This ought
also to tnrn out a very interesting set-to,
as Pepper's mode of fighting is well known
on this coast and Purceil is said to be a
hard man to handle.
The third contest will be between the
feather-weights, "Kid" O'Brien of Los
Angeles and Ed Pincus of Sacramento.
Things have been so arranged in the
Grove-street Theater, the scene of the se
ries of fistic battles, that all can have good
seats, and the ring is in a fair location.
The contest between Joe McAuliffe and
Choynski will take rJace next Friday
evening at Woodward's Pavilion. Gus
Her;cet and "Spider" Kelly will box on
this occasion.
Negotiations have been carried on for
some time with regard to Manager Gibbs
taking charge of the proposed contest be
tween Jimmy Carroll ana Jack McAuliffe.
Sunday night Gibbs was requested to be
present at a meeting of the St. George Club
with a .view to making such an arrange
ment.
He went, with the result that papers
were signed by which he will not only
have charge of this contest, but all battles
conducted under the St. George Club's
auspices. McAuliffe and Carroll are
booked to meet each other about the mid
dle of November.
FRANCIS SPRING'S WILL.
His Wife Made the Principal Legatee
of m I..arge .Estate.
The will of Francis S. Spring, who died
in this City a few days ago, was riled for
probate yesterday. The testator be
queathes to John H. and Charlotte H.
Spring, children by his tirst wife Nancy, a
quantity of jewelry, pictures and other
effects. To his second wife, Anna, who
survives him, he leaves $100,000. Incase
i the estate exceeds $350,000 his sister Mar
caret is to receive $4000, his brother Henry
$4000; his niece, Hannah Appleton, $4000;
her son, William Arpleton, $2000; Mrs.
George T. Myers $4000, Grace Little $4000,
to the children of Horace E. Little $2000,
Ella Hoi brook $500. The residue goes to
his children, John H. and Charlotte H.
Spring. __________
THE GRAND JURY.
Its Final Report Will Earnestly Recom
mend the Adoption of the New
Charter.
The present Grand Jury, which was im
paneled last December, may adjourn sine
die next week. Work on the final report,
which was interrupted last week by the
sickness of Expert Dunn, has been re
sumed.
Foreman Frank Maskey returned yester
day from Marysville, and Theodore F.
Payne is here again from the redwoods.
At the session of the jury next Friday the
expert may report the result of his in
spection of the books of the Edison Light
and Power Company. The foreman has
received information that the company
offered no objection to the examination of
th" books.
It is said that the report of the Grand
Jury will earnestly advocate the adoption
of the new charter by the voters of San
Francisco and will contain facts and
figures to prove that the taxpayers cannot
obtain much relief from extravagance
in the management of municipal affairs
unless the proposed charter be accepted.
John Landers, one of the committee
appointed to prepare tba final report, will
be obliged to leave for Honolulu on the
steamship that goes next Saturday.
NO PLACE FOR WORKMEN
Guatemala Is Not a Paradise
for Mechanics of Any
Kind.
Deluded Seekers After Wealth Travel
Far to Find Disappoint
-1 ment.
The mechanics who went from here
some time since to Guatemala to work on
the exposition buildings there, and who
have been under the impression that
Guatemala was booming and was a good
place to go to, are writing here that it is
really no place for the California citizen
and are advisine them to stay at home.
Harry Blanchard, one of these, has writ
ten to a friend here, as follows:
We arrived in this place two days ago. Jack
and I went to work this morning at $6 per
day, but we do not know how long the work is
going to last. Everything In this place is
dear. Jack Conway paid *H for a hat that you
can get in Ban b ranclsco for 50 cents. A pair
of boots cost $11. It will cost us $60 per
month for our living, and very poor at that.
You cannot get a meal fit to eat for less than %
â¢1. Butter costs $150 per pound. Clothing
ihout of the question. Do not advise any 01
the boys to come to this country. They are
better off in San Francisco. * â¢ â¢
Tlie subjoined letter from Guatemala
City, and bearing a recent date, sheds
further light on the situation there. The
letter is from John Conway, Mr. Blan
chard's friend, and reads:
"I will give yon a dead pointer, if I knew
as much when I was in San Francisco I
would have stayed there. We worked rive
days iast week and Saturday evening
Harry got laid off. Harry has not struck
anything since, for there are lots of good
mechanics out of work. More are coming,
too, on every steamer.
"This world's f.iir that they are going
to nave here is bringing men from all
over. Advise your friends to steer clear
of Guatemala, for there is nothing here.
Of course the wages look big, but when you
take into consideration what you have to
pay for board, lodging and tbe little things
you may happen to need you are really
working for about |i 25 a day in our
money.
"In the first place $1 in our money is
worth $2 20 in Guatemala money, so you
see $6 50 a day is really only a little over
$2 50 in our money.
"Then you must consider $50 for board
and $12 for your room each month, and
your washing will amount to $5 or $6.
Now is the rainy season, too, so there is no
chance to work steady, for about all the
work is on the outside, an the roofs of
buildings. The buildings are all built of
doby and have tile floors. No inside finish
at all, only a few doors and windows, and
the natives get most all that, for they do
the work at half what an American will.
"We board in a Chinese restaurant, it
being the cheapest. You cannot touch
the hotels for less than $4 a day, and the
grub you get is something horrible. We
get coffee at 6:30 a. m. and go to work at
7; (juit at 11 for breakfast, go to work
again at 12, work until 5 and have dinner
at 6. You get nothing here but mescal,
which is 6 cents a class, and one is enough
for you, too. A small glass of gin or
liquor costs 25 cents."

A HYPATIA IN
CLASSIC BERKELEY.
Bertha Monroe Rickoff's
Idea of Woman's
Suffrage.
WOMAN EVER WOMANLY
Would Have the Wife a Wage-
Earner Like the
Husband.
THE NOTION CHARMS WOMEN.
And Even Men, When They Thor
oughly Understand OBer, .Be
come Her Disciples.
Over on the classic Berkeley hills liyes
Miss Bertha Monroe Rickoff, a young
woman whose intellectual influence on
questions pertaining to the advancement
of her sex is constantly spreading, and
whose ideas on this theme, it is sineular to
state, become more attractive to the mas
culine mind the more clearly they are
understood.
Miss Rickoff believes in woman's ad-
vancement pure and simple. She says
women are emancipated enough at the
present day.
She would have wives engage in profit
able occupations, either in a kind of part
nership with their husbands, perhaps, or
in some other line of business wherein
their particular abilities would be best
used.
In this way husbands would find a long
desired financial aid. "Women would not
then," said Miss Rickoff yeÃterday, "at
tract so much through the purely sen
suous element as they do now.
"I have seen so many young girls whose
parents were poor and who were being ed
ucated to fill no remunerative position
whatever, and theni have seen young
men who were old enough to marry and
desired to marry, yet were not financially
able. Suppose that these girls could also
support themselves. Then marriage
would become possible."
Miss Rickoff is an ardent believer in the
development of home virtues. She advo
cates woman's advancement, but on wo
manly lines. She boldly declares that suf
frage *is not the sum total of this advance
ment.
"It 13 a misfortune," said she, "that the
suffrage question has ever been called
'woman's rights.' It has put woman in a
belligerent attitude and this has done
much to antagonize the most conserva
tive element.
"1 would not banish the home or the
ties of affection between man and woman.
I would simply make woman more attrac
tive to man by her usefulness, and conse
quently her increased ability to sympa
thize with him and hold him to nerself.
Home then would become even more
sacred, and affection would be truer and
stronger."
It occurs to those who listen to Miss
Rickoff speak with animation on this
subject, that it really would be a very de-
Bertha Monroe Rickoff.
liphtful sort of a condition of affairs after
all. There is a charm to her personality
and a sympathetic womanly ring in her
voice. It is also said that she is no mean
artist in the virtues of hospitality.
Miss Rickoff is a descendant of a noble
Russian family, the members of which
have been distinguished for their in
tellectual ability.
Miss Rickoff has original thoughts not
only on the suffrage question, but in
various other fields. One of her favorite
ideas, and one that has stirred up consid
erable discussion in literary circles, is her
belief in the educational function of the
novel.
"The novel will develop into being,"
.â¢aid she, "the kindergarten of the world,
it is the greatest existing force even now
for influencing the masses.
"The only novel which Is worthy of
filling this use is the realistic. Novels
nowadays are becoming the food for ma
turer minds and not simply the enter
tainar of idleness. I class Zola and George
Meredith above the rank of the novelist.
'Trilby' I consider the most pernicious
work of the day. It too vividly depicts
the pleasures of vice without attaching
thereto the suffering resulting from it.
"The novel is absorbing the offices
hitherto relegated to the priests. I be
lieve that education is far more effective
if addressed to the emotional and spiritual
part of the nature."
Miss Rickoff is quite the fad with the
most exclusive circles in all the bay cities.
! She conduct.-* classes iv the criticism of
current fiction that include as members
some of the wealthiest lovers of literature
of San Francisco and Oakland. She is an
Ohio girl, hut enjoys the proud distinction
ot having been presented to the Queen.
Bhe is a constant contributor to the
North American Review. Furthermore,
slie is a poetess and improvises at times
unconsciously. Yesterday she said, while
speaking in a general way regarding the
omnipresence of the deity: "While we
are looking for God through an intellect
ual telescope he is calling to us from the
flowers at our feet."
People Who Want Work.
The State's Free Employment Bureau was
established by Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald
in July of last year. Since that time a large
amount oi good has been done by the bureau
in the way of obtaining employment for
people who were unable to obtain work for
themselves. Some idea of what has been ac
complished during the first year of the
bureau's existence may be obtained from
figures recently compiled in the office. It
shows that between the dates mentioned tne
total male registration for work was 14,251,
and positions were found for 3314. The total
female regisiratlon was 4669, of which 2531
obtained work.
CRUELTY AT PRESIDIO.
Four Men Arrested for Workine Dis
abled Horsesâ Reports of Inhu
manity to Pigeons.
J. M. Soutnworth, Elmer Miller, James
Berry and G. F. Jennings, teamsters em
ployed in the grading now in progress at
the Presidio, were placed und#r arrest yes
terday by Officers Hooper and Ddmer of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals. There are about 140 horses at
work, among which are some who are un
serviceable. General Graham arrested two
men whom he detected treating horses
cruelly and locked them up over night in
the guardhouse; but seeing that the ex
ample did not deter others from similar
offenses, the general reported the case to
the society, detailing a sergeant to accom
pany tiie officers and assist, if necessary,
in making the arrests. Six horses and two
mules were taken from work and sent to
be treated. The Presidio will henceforth be
visited at intervals by. officers of the so
ciety.
The society is also contemplating some
action in relation to craelties committed
at pigeon-shooting matches. Last Sunday
about 1000 birds were let loose near the
Fourteen-milo House, on the San Bruno
road, to be shot at by members of a local
club. An army of small boys went after
the wounded pigeons, beating them with
willow switches and otherwise torturing
them. One enterprising child of older
growth went about on a bicycle collecting
candidates for a pigeon pie, leaving at
length with four or hve dozen birds hang
ing from the bars of the machine.
SHE IS SLOWLY DYING.
Mrs. John J. Farrell's Life Despaired
Ofâ Her Statement Almost
Unintelligible.
The life of Mrs. John T. Farrell flickered
like an extinguishing candle all during
yesterday. The unfortunate woman, sur
rounded by her family and friends, lay at
her home, at 20 Henry street, with every
prospect of an early death as a result of
the rash act in which she indulged tofi&rht
off the cares of maternity.
The authorities have detained Dr. Mc-
Beth, the physician who, the woman
claims, attended her and placed her in her
present critical condition.
Yesterday morning he was escorted to
the woman's home, but she was unable to
recognize him as the physician who treated
her. The detectives have secured an ante
mortem statement from the woman, but it
is so indistinct and unintelligible that it
can hardly be used as evidence. In it tbe
woman claims that her visit to the offices
of the physician dates back a month or
more.
A Painter's Fall.
R. H. Weitknecht, a painter living at 123
Hickory avenue, was working at 507 Gough
street yesterday when he fell oil" a staging a
distance of about thirty feet. His right thigh
was dislocated and his right wrist and nose
cut. He was taken to the Receiving Hospital,
where his injuries were attended to.

WILL BOYCOTT
THE RAILROAD,
Wheelmen Will Give Pref
erence to Sonoma Val
ley Roads.
RUNS TO MARIN COUNTY.
A Mass-Meeting May Be Held
to Fight the Company Po
litically.
BILL FOR THE LEGISLATURE.
An Attorney Thinks the Supreme
Court Would Hold That Bicycles
Are Baggage.
Feeling against the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company is intensifying among
the 15,000 wheelmen of San Francisco and
the 40,000 wheelmen in the State over the
recent decision of that company to charge
25 cents for carrying a bicycle between
any two points and for taxing bicyclists
who cross the bay 10 cents for each wheel.
A boycott has been declared on the
Southern Pacific by a large number of
wheelmen, and the others, it is said, will
doubtless take the same course.
A mass-meeting of wheelmen of this
City will be called in the near future for
the purpose of taking action politically.
This will be the beginning of the wheel
men's campaign against the Southern Pa
cific and against any candidate for the
Legislature who is opposed to the passage
of a bill compelling the Southern Pacific
Company and the railroads of the State to
carry bicycles free as baggage, as is the
law now in the State of New York.
An attorney who is president of one of
the cycling clubs, has given an opinion to
the effect that be thinks bicycles properly
come under the head of baggage, and says
he thinks the Supreme Court of the State
would so hold.
Charles A. Adams, an attorney, and
president of the Olympic Bicycle Club,
said yesterday afternoon : "When tne
Armstrong bill, requiring railroads to
carry bicycles free as baggage, was passed
in New l r ork, I looked into the law bear
ing on the subject to a considerable ex
tent, and I am of the opinion that bicycles
are bageage. My research extended back
to an English case in which the Chief
justices of England decided that a thing
carried for tne comfort and convenience of
the passenger is baggage. For instance,
an easel would be baggage for an artist,
but not for a sportsman, and a gun would
be baggage for a sportsman, but not for an
artist. Thus you can see that a bicycle is
a comfort and a convenience for a wheel
man. I am of the opinion that our
Supreme Court would hold that a bicycle
is bapgage."
"Have any provisions been made for a
test case in order to bring the question
before the Supreme Court?"
"Xone that I am aware of. You see
nobody wants to spend his time and
money fighting the Southern Pacific.
"I did not Know of this decision of the
Southern Pacific until we were coming in
on the train from Stockton last night.
Some of the Olympics went out there
yesterday. We all decided to boycott the
Southern Pacific. We will make our runs
up in Murin County. The roads are good
up that wav for a very long distance. On
the other side of the bay we will go up the
Sonoma Valley and patronize the Stetson
road, the North Pacific Coast, which does
not charge for bicycles. The roads are
good up that way, also. We shall not
lack for room at all, and I think the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company will
not make much money by requiring wheel
men to pay for carrying their wheels. If
tne wheelmen will stick together politi
cally, and in this instance as there is a
personal interest at stake I am inclined to
think they may, and undertake to prevent
the election of any man to the Legislature
who is opposed to givine the wheelmen
their rights, we can accomplish some
thing. 1 believe they have already under
taken this in the organization of a wneel
nien's municipal league."
R. I* Radke, president of the Imperial
Bicycle Club, said: "We don't nave to
cross the bay to get to San Jose. We can
go around the other way, you know. We
don't have to patronize the Southern
Pacific. There are others. Between 700
and 1000 wheelmen go over on the ferries
to Oakland every Sunday. Yes, I have
heard some talk o' an opposition ferry
line and 1 know the wheelmen would
patronize it. I think they would stick to
gether better than tne general public did
in its patronage of the Davie ferry, which
was not patTonized after it had compelled
the Southern Pacific to reduce the ferry
fare to ten cents.
"Politically we can accomplish a great
deal," he said. "It is estimated that there
are 15,000 people in San Francisco who
ride bicycles and the number in the State
is probably about 40,000. That number of
men, with their personal, political and
business influence with others, ought to be
a considerable political power and prevent
the election of men to the Legislature who
are opposed to the passage of a bill com
pelling railroads to carry bicycles free as
baggage, as is done in the State of New
York. The Wheelmen's Municipal
League, I understand, will take the mat
ter up in connection with its work for good
roads and good streets."
Judge Frank 11. Kerrigan, who is chief
consul of the L. A. W. for the Northern
Division of California, in giving his views
on the coming contest between the wheel
men and the Southern Pacific of Ken
tucky, and speaking for the organization
of which be is the head, said substan
tially:
"The railroad company could not have
thrown down the gauntlet at a more op
portune time. It will cause the wheelmen
to assume the aggressive political and
take steps to protect their right;.
"Tnere are 100 local branch consuls in
the Northern Division of this State," he
continued, "and among the members of
this organization are many repre
sentative citizens, Senators and pros
pective Assemblymen, besides well
known business men and active politi
cians. All of these will see to it that a
bill, similar to the Armstrong bill, which
has become a law in the State of New
York, will be introduced at the next
meeting of the Legislature. This will
classify bicycles as merchandise and en
title a passenger to carry with him the
usual weignt by virtue of his ticket. As it
is now there is no fixed rule even between
any two towns in this Stale.
"For instance, a wheelman is charged
nothing for the carriage of his wheel
between San Francisco and Ban Jose, but
between Monterey and San Francisco the
charge is 65 cents, and between Monterey
and Ban Jose 40 cents. Thus it will be
seen that the railroad company do the
squeezing act when and wherever they
think the people will submit without
s murmur."
At a meeting of the board of directors, at
which Chief Consul F. H. Kerrigan, Vice-
Consul H. F. Winn, Secretary and Treas
urer Stanley G. Scovern and others, were
present, it was decided to call a meeting
of the board of officers of all the branch
consuls in the northern district for Sep
tember sin this City. At this meeting all
parts of the estate will have representa
tives, numbering about 200 delegates.
Such action will be taken as will procure
for the wheelmen what they consider their
rights in regard to the transportation of
bicycles.
Sacramento has one of the best organi
zations in any city in the State. Santa
Cruz is not far behrnd and in this City the
Supervisors have given heed to the wants
of the wheelmen by improving the condi
tion of the roads.
San Francisco is now making steady
progress with the organization of a muni
cipal league, which will represent 7500
voters. This is said to be the political
strength of the combined clubs in this
City. This does not include men, worren
and children who are classed as non-affili
ating members, but all of whom have a
deep interest in the action of the railroad
company in compelling the owners of
bicycles to pay for the privilege of taking
a wheel across the bay on the ferry-boats.
Thomas H. U. Varney stated he would
assist the wheelmen in every way that lay
in his power to oppose the charge for the
transportation of wheels. He said he un
derstood that a mass-meeting would be
held in the near future, at which a decided
expression of opinion would be heard
against the decision of the railroad com
pany and some united action taken to op
pose it.
WARLIKE WAVERLEYS.
The Charter to Be Reopened In
Order ThataStrong Organization
May Fight the Railway.
To the Waverley Cycling Club seems to
belong the distinction of being the pioneer
in the war which the various bodies of
wheelmen contemplate waging upon the
corporation which seems about to tax
their sport. The officers and a few of the
leading spirits of the club met last night
in executive session to take some decisive
step by way of opening the campaign.
P. A. Joy, the acting president, in a
brief but strong address called the atten
tion of those present to the manner in
whicn the favorite diversion of a large
proportion of tbe young men of the City
would be curtailed, in case the railway
carries out its threat of charging baggage
rates upon bicycles. S. W. Elston, the
secretary, and other officers spoke in a
similar vein, and much indignation was
manifested. It was Â» t length decided that
the charter of the club should be reopened,
and all bicyclists invited to 3ign it with
out being required to pay the usual ini
tiation fee. By this means the member
ship, already large, will be much aug
mented, and a phalanx of fighters formed
which will do gallant battle in the pur
suit of bicycl'stic happiness.
A COMEDY OF ERRORS.
Two Purses Similar in Appear
ance Lead to the Arrest of
a Rancher.
Lieutentant Burke Finally Succeeds
in Straightening Out the
Tangle.
A comedy of errors, which narrowly
escaped being a tragedy, occurred last
evening in a saloon at Twelfth and Mis
sion streets and concluded at the Seven
teenth-street police station.
Sam Kirkland, a young man who had
been working some time on the Jersey
Farm, Point Arena, started out to see the
sights.
Last evening he fetched up at Mrs.
Schwartz's saloon, at Twelfth and Mis
sion streets. There he met Thomas
O'Brien, a rancher from Novato. They
had several dunks together and Kirkland
turned sick. O'Brien led him to a room
in the rear and returned to the bar. He
puiled out his purse to pay for the last
drinks they had, and just then Kirkland
came bacK and claimed the purse as his.
Finally both were taken in charge by an
officer.
At the Seventeenth - street station
O'Brien protested his innocence to Lieu
tenant Burke and referred him to several
well-known citizens as to his good charac
ter. He also showed him a draft on the
San Francisco Sayings Union Bank for
j $870. O'Brien was searched and a purse
j containing $75 in gold and a Key was
! found in his pocket. Kirkland claimed
that the purse and the key belonged to
him, but O'Brien persisted that they were
his property.
It looked bad for O'Brien, but it occurred
to Lieutenant Burke to question Kirkland
closely and then he ordered him to be
searched. In the inside of his vest was a
pocket and in the pocket was a purse con
taining $80 in gold and $4 75 in silver.
Strange to say both purses were identical
in appearance and it was easy to mistake
the one for the other. Kirkland never
thought of searching his- pocicets to see if
his purse was there, but jumped to the
conclusion that O'Brien's was his.
Both were locked up for being under the
influence of liquor after congratulating
each upon the happy outcome of the af
fair.
To Fool His Creditor
P. C. Jones, as assignee of Louis Landler, an
insolvent debtor, yesterday began suit against
Homer 8. King to recover property valued at
$80,000, which he alleges Landier transferred
to King to keep it beyond the reach of his
creditors and to evade the insolvency act. The
property consists of a lot on Jackson street,
another on Twenty-first street, lots 466 and
1842 in the girt map, one on Stanyan street,
on Sixth avenue, on Filbert street, on Octavia
street, on Diamond street, on Twenty-third
street, on Washington street, on Twenty-fifth
street, on Elizabeth street, on Frederick street,
on Hartford street and some twenty acres of
land in Tulare County.

One of the busiest places in the City at

which artisans, mechanics, laborers, con
tractors and bosses are crowding against

one another in the hurry and bustle to gel
ready for the opening day, which is not
far off. The indications are at this time
that this will be one of the greatest dis
plays of home-industry products that has
ever been presented to the people of the
State of California.
The Joshua Hendy works will have at
the corners of the large space it w,ll oc
cupy, and at equal distance along the
rails, iron rods, on the top of which will
be an escutcheon, bearing in bold letters
the words "Home Industry."
The Cook Belting Company has erected
a very picturesque booth on the rustic
plan, built entirely, except the support, of
tanbark. The effect is novel and striking.
The Swiss-Italian colony was busy yes
terday putting in position a number of
tuns, some as large as a cottage, to illus
trate in what kind of receptacles wine is
held before it is drawn off to out on tbe
market.
The Dairy Association's show, which is
to be in the western end of the annex, is
already assuming shape, and it promises
to be one of the most attractive and in
structive exhibits.
The exterior of the grand Egyptian
booth is all up and tbe directors are put
ting on the odd figures and characters
that characterize the country it will rep
resent, but the interior will not contain a
display of the products of the country on
the Nile. It will be filled with almost
every product of the State, in tins, in cans,
in boxes, in barrels and in glass.
Numerous fancy and odd shaped booths
are going up on every part of the main
floor and in tbe galleries, and the stranger
who wanders into the big building won
ders what they will be like and what they
will contain.
The high ceiling has been hung with
deep festoons of crimson cloth which in a
measure cover the unsightly trusses of the
great arch. The galleries have been hung
with red, white, blue and yellow muslin in
graceful festoons, very pleasing to the
eye.
In Machinery Hall there was a great
confused mass of boilers, machinery and
rods and tubes, which a large force of men
were handling and putting in proper
position. Â, . Â
The tanks in which there will be the
fish exhibit have been tested and found to
be perfect. The exhibit, which will be in
charge of the California Fish Commission,
will, it is promised, be a fine display of
the fi3h of the brooks and lakes of the
State. The commission will also have m
operation a hatchery.
The art gallery this year will have many
pictures, and the majority of them have
never before been on exhibition in the
Mechanics' Pavilion. Moet of them are
by local artists.
The rejection committee, composed of
artists whose names are withheld, has
been kept busy passing upon pictures that
are suitable tor exhibition, and those that
have been accepted are ranged along the
walls of the grand salon. On Wednesday
the hanging committee will commence the
work of placing tbe pictures. Tne pictures
of each artist will be hung in groups. Up
to yesterday there had been received
half" a dozen large pictures and a great
number of smaller ones.

GRANT'S BUST IS
NOT YET UNVEILED
The Monument Stands Com
pleted in Golden Gate
Park.
SWATHED IN WRAPPINGS
The Next Chapter in Its History
Promises to Be a Law
suit.
SCHMID'S CLAIM REJECTED.
The Committee Says It Has No Money
to Pay for the Sculptor's Modi*
fixations.
For over a month the Grant memorial
has been entirely completed, but it still
stands draped in Golden Gate Park, and
to judge from the present outlook it will
stand there a long time before General
Barnes is called upon for the inaugural
address which he has promised to deliver.
The deadlock in the unveiling of the mon
ument is caused by a difference of opinion
respecting the money value of the statue.
Rupert Schmid, tbe sculptor, claims $560
more than the memorial committee desires
to pay, and Herbert Choynski, the sculp
tor's lawyer, said yesterday that he feared
the end of the dispute would be a lawsuit,
during which the monument will have to
remain nidden from the public gaze under
its wrappings.
''The memorial was to have been un
veiled on Decoration day, but the commit
tee has not yet accepted the design and
shows no signs of intending to do so,"
said Herbert Choynski. "The trouble
arose out of the modifications. According
to the original contract the bust was to
rest on a plain shaft of green sandstone,
with laurel wreaths at the base, orna
mented with four bronze scrolls, each
bearing tbe name of a battle.
"This design was very plain and severe,
and Isaac Hecht, the chairman of the
committee, but now deceased, expressed a
desire to have it modified. At his request
Mr. Schmid had four eagles with out
stretched wings cast in bronze, and in
other ways the design was extended and
embellished. It was understood that
these modifications were made with
the consent of the committee, but,
though the sculptor paid for the casting
and the transportation from Europe, and
has biils to show for it, the committe- re
fuses to pay more than the original design
calls for."
Colonel Choynski says that one reason
for no more money being forthcoming is
that the funds are all exhausted.
"I am unable to state positively whether
the Examiner paid for the base or not,"
he said. "If it did there should still be
funds, for t saw the bankbook of the
memorial fund at one time, and the
amount to the committee's credit exceed
ed $3000. The committee says that the
Examiner did not pay for the base. Two
payments have already been made to the
sculptor, but if tne Examiner paid for the
base there should certainly be money in
the bank.
"According to the contract Rupert
Schmid was to provide a base of green
sandstone out of the second payment of
$1000. Con O'Connor suggested that a base
of granite would look better and he stipu
lated with us that we should give him $250
and be would have tbe base made by some
one whose name he would not divulge. It
afterward transpired that the granite base
was being made at Folsoni prison. After
that the Examiner offered to pay for a
granite base, but I don't pretend to say
whether it did or not. If the Examiner
paid the committee cannot be without
funds.
"There are a whole number of people
who put down their names as subscrbers
who have never paid up."

The Power
Of JManhood.
It is good to feel strongâ to know that
you are as vigorous as your fellow man.
Then you have nothing tp regret in your
past lifeâ nothing that has left you weak
in body and mind.' ; ,
You can be strong. You can make your
nerves wiry j and powerful by charging
them with electricity from Dr. Sanden's
Electric Belt. .31SPgj
There are thousands of happy men who
proclaim to the world the great benefits
derived from this wonderful Belt. It
cured them after other remedies had failed
to do so. .
The following are extracts from letters
recently received :.
"lam a laboring man and for many years
was a sufferer from seminal weakness, which
so debilitated me at times before I bought
your Belt that on many occasions I " had to
give up my work. I wore the Belt . continu-
ously at night for three months, and at the
end of that time I was well and strong.. I
cannot say too much in praise of your Belt
and do not intend to part with mine the rest
of my life."â P. H. Gale, Indio, Cal. . v ,
"I would like to add my testimony to the
numerous others in possession of Dr. Sauden's
Electric Belt Co. I bought a strong-power
Belt from Dr. Sanden about the Ist of April,
which I used according to . directions, , and
after three months I am happy to state that
my varicocele, which "â¢ was of twelve years'
standing, Is almost entirely â¢ disappeared. I
take great pleasure in recommending the Belt
to any one suffering from varicocele." â W. E.
Johns, 1139 Market St., San Francisco. * â¢â¢
"I bought your Belt three weeks ago for kid-
ney and bladder trouble. I had previous to
that time been laid up in bed for five weeks.
My trouble came on me last March, and on
many occasions I was so bad that I 1 was con-
fined to my bed. The third time that I put
your Belt on I found relief and have kept Im-
proving ever since. I will take great pleasure
in recommending your Belt."â W. T. Myers,
135 East Tweniy-iourth at, Los Angeles, Cal.
Every day Dr. Sanden receives letters
like these. The evidence, is so powerful,
the letters so grateful and the gooa done
by this Belt so general that it must be
considered a great remedy.
DO YOU FEEL WEAK? Do you lack
energy ana vigor? Is your power waning?
If so read Dr. Sanden's book, "Three
Classes of Men." It can be had free,
staled, on request. Address or call

BRIGHT DEMOCRACY
Sound Money Democrats
Boldly Enter the Cam
paign Field.
STATE LEAGUE FORMED
A Full Delegation to Be Sent
to the Indianapolis Na
tional Convention.
THIKTEEN DELEGATES NAMED
A Permanent 0 ganization and a
Heroic Extaibiiion of Loyalty
to Principle.
The sounJ-naoney and old-line Demo
crats of California who are ready in this
political crisis to stand by the ancient and
basic principles of their pany and who
are so true to their political principles
that they cannot swallow Populist Bryan
and the Ponulistic Chicago platform yes
terday swung bravely into line with the
"Indianapolis." sound-money movement.
At a large and representative gathering
in the parlors of the Grand Hotel they de
cided to send a lull California delegation
to the National Sound-money Democratic
Convention to be held at Indianapolis on
September 2, aud tuirteen of the eighteen
delegates were named.
This political gathering was not s great
one in the popular sense of "great" as ap
plied to ti political meeting. But then it
deserved the adjective "great" for several
reasons."
For one thing the Democracy of Cali
fornia has not in its political history
gathered party representatives at any
convention who embraced bo high a per
centage of the intelligence, the loyalty to
party principles and the real nobility,
civic heroism and all that is best in the
great political party which began when
Jefferson and Randolph proclaimed their
political faiths, as that which character
izes the menibers of the Sound-money
Democratic League of California, which
yesterday permanently oraanized and took
iis place amid the political forces of the
Golden State.
The Democratic "push" did not attend
the conference, for ihe "Honor-hriirht
Democracy," as John P. lri h has dubbed
it, has no prospective patronage to
distribute.
Every man who could give his time to
attend the notable gathering did ?o and
pledged his fealty to the true Democratic
cause, not only without the shadow of a
hope ot political reward, but with the cer
tainty that he severed his chance of se
curins influeuce or reward from the in
truders who have captured the party.
The meeting was the second meeting of
the sound-money Democjacy. When
Temporary Chairman E. R. TavJor called
the meeting to order lie announced that
i he business was the Questions of sending
a delegation to the National convention
and permanent organization.
John P. Irish was called for to give his
views on the matter of sending a delega
tion and be respooded in a brief and forci
ble way.
"I think," he said, "that It is absolutely
necessary that we to-day constitute and ac
credit a delegation to the National conven
tion. If we do not do so, it will be dis
couraging to our Eastern friends. Oregon,
Washington, Wyoming and other Pacific
Coast State 3 will be represented, and it
would bs a great mistake if California
were not represented.
"The trutli is, we have been idle too
long and have trusted too long to the silent
power of principles. We have abandoned
the ear of the public to the Populists and
they have been able to engraft their prin
ciples on the Democratic party, or rather,
they have be<Â»n able to exclude from the
National Democratic Convention any true
expression of Democratic principles and
to substitute their own.
"The present position of the Democratic
r>arty is due to the fact that we have left
ttie field open to them. The socialists
and the communists have been infesting
the platform of the Iroquois Club for
eighteen months, and they have thus and
in other ways been indoctrinating the
masses with their principles, while we
have remained silent.
"No matter if we will not be able to put
an electoral ticket in the field. Let us go
ahead and promulgate our principles. I
am not advising anybody to vote for Mc-
Kinley and I am not advising anybody to
vo'.e against McKjnley. Let the results
take care of themselves.
"I received a letter the other day from
Judge Bond saying that Lake County was
full of sound-money Democrats who had
nothing tangible to tie to, and I have re
ceived similar letters from all over the
State. I propose myself to attend the
Indianapolis convention, and my ticket i 3
already bought for Thursday evening. I
have official information that the rates to
this convention over all the main trunk
lines will be one fare for the round trin.
Those appointed as delegates who cannot
go should forward to the delegation their
proxies in blank.
â¢'When the Indianapolis movement is
over, Chairman Jones will not again teie
graph all over the country that the In
dianapolis movement is too contemptible
and insignificant for consideration. We
will show him who is contemptible and in
significant"
Judge Robert Y. Hayne offered the only
suggestion in opposition 10 the election of
delegates. He observed that, as electors
would not be nominated here, they would
not represent any political party and he
believed that the efforts of the organiza
tion should be embraced not in typifying
signs of activity, but in the promulgation
of principles to every voter in the Stat?
through the mediums of public speakers
and campaign literature.
Marcus Rosen thai backed up Mr. Irish's
argument and observed that it would m
jurr the cause all over the country if Cali
fornia were not represented at the
National convention when those delegates
would represent 20,000 to 25,000 Demo
cratic voters in the State.
"The Democrats of this State, said Mr.
Rosenthaj, "are not to be led over into the
Populist camp."
After some discussion a motion was car
ried that a delegation 10 the National con
vention be appointed, leaving four of the
eighteen delegates to the Sound-money
Democratic Club of Los Aneeles. E. B.
Pond, in seconding this motion, suggested
that all the Congressional districts be rep
resented. Judge Hayne withdrew his op
position, and with complete unanimity a
committee of three was authorized to
nominate delegaetf. The chair appointed
E. B. Pond, Marcus RosentbaJ and Charles
H. Bhinn, and the committee retired to
prepare its report.
As the committee retired permanent or
ganization was taken up on motion of At
torney William Thomas, and a committee
on permanent organization, consisting of
William Thomas, John P. Irish and H, F.
Fortmann, was appointed.
During tne absence of this ; jcond oom
mittee Chairman Taylor read a number of
letters from all over the State, addressed
to Mr. Pond and others, showing the m

The report of the committee on per

dent, Jereruiah Lynch; secretary, Elliott
McAllister; treasurer, A. A. Watkins.
The constitution as adopted at the first
meeting prescribed that any person who
voted for'the National Democratic ticket
of 1892 may become a member upon pay
ment of a fee of $1.
On motion of Attorney Thomas this was
unanimously amended to read: "Any
Democrat may become a member on the
payment ot $1."
On the temporary organization the name
"Sound-money Democratic Club of Ban
Francisco" was adopted, but on motion
the name was changed to "The Sound
money Democratic League of California."
The organization thus assumed its
natural State-wide scope, and from now
on the new league will be a Stats affair in
the scope of its vigorous work as well as
la its name and membership.
E. B. Pond reported the following thir
teen nominations for delegates to the
National Convention, and they were unani
mously elected :
Nathaniel Harris, Jeremiah Lynch, John P.
Irish, William Thomas, E. S. Heller, San Fran
cisco; John A. Stanley, Warren Olney, Oak
land; Clay W. Taylor, Shasta; Cassius Carter,
San Diego; John Roth, Visalia; J. H. O'Brien,
I Murysvil!e; Thomas B. Eoud, Lakeport; F.
j Lippiit, Petaluma.
Four of the five vacancies were left to
Los Angeles and one, for special reasons,
wns left to the future claim of the com
mittee.
It wa3 ordered that the committee
should fill any vacancies occurring by
reason of appointees refusing to ?erve,
and it was recommended by resolution
that any delegates who found themselves
unable to go to Indianapolis should for
ward their proxies in blank to the delega
tion.
Mr. Irish announced that 10,000 copies
of John G. Carlisle's speech to the work
ingmen at Chicago were on the way to
California, and that much otner campaign
literature oi a high grade of merit would
early be on hand for distribution.
The effective permanent organization
wiil not be completed until the executive
committee and its various sub-committees
on campaign work are appointed, but
President Taylor announced that the exec
utive committee would be appointed very
soon.
The Sound-money Democratic League of
California will thus send an able delega
tion to Indianapolis; conduct an effective
political campaign in this State, and work
with tne intense earnestness that attends
intense devotion to principle.
An adjournment to- the early call of the
chair was taken.
The membership of the league has
greatly increased during the few days since
tha first meeiing. It was found at the
meeting yesterday that many rolls which
have been in circulation were not reported,
but the following were the additional
names of representative Democrats en
rolled by Secretary McAllister:

Among the letters that were read at the
meeting yesterday was the following from
Farmer C. P. Summera of Yolo County,
who is not a capitalist:
YOLO. Cal. , August 23, 1896.
Hon. E. S. Pond, San Francisco, Cal.â Dear
Sir: I should like to help bring about a gold
standard Democratic organization in this
county. Any suggestions you may feel like
offering will be gladly received. I think that
we have enough gold-standard Democrats in
this county to form an organization. I am a
plain and simple farmer, but I look upon the
free coinage of silver as National and indi
vidual ruin. I would like to hear from you if you
have time io write. I am, very respectfully,
Charles P. Summers.
P. S.â l have agreed to debate the financial
question in Woodland in October. Have you
any literature you can send me that will help
the fight for sound money.
The railroad employe who earns ?1 85 a
day, who wrote the following letter, is not
a capitalist, but evidently belongs to that
portion of the laboring class which thinks
for itself:
TrLARE, Cal., Aug. 14, 1896.
Hon. E. B. Pond, San Francisco, Cal.â My Dear
Sir: J take the liberty to address you upon a
matter that concerns all good citizens. I refer
to the matter of nominating a real Democrat
for President. As I read in the daily press, we
are to have a convention September 2 at
Indianapolis. Some seem to think we should
not nominate a candidats, but should all
work for McKinley in order to defeat Bryan.
Why, pray, anould we cast our Dallots for" Mc-
Kinley?
There are many Democrats In and about
Tulare who will never vote for McKinley. The
election of McKinley or Bryan would be, in
my estimation, a National calamity.
Some of our delegates at Indianapolis are on
record as saying that the National Democratic
party had no hope of carrying a singie State.
1 am sorry that any Democrat should ao ex
press himself, no matter what the prospect.
First we must look to the perpetuation
oi the Democratic party, since I am con
vinced that the Populist wing of our party
can naver organize again in convention as the
Democratic party. They are Populists and
can only live in the future as the Populist
party. I hope our people will enter the cam
paign with hope. Our prospects for winning
are nil, I admit, but i would fight as though I
meant to win. To be sure two gold tickets can
draw more votes than one. It looks like
Bryan to-day, but witnin sixty days Bryan
will not "know where he is at." The malady
affecting our 16 to 1 Democratic friends
is temporary insanity. Some of the patterns
will develop a permanent form of the malady,
but most of them will recover possession of
their reasoning faculties, and will want to
vote against ti.e silventes; and it is our duty
to provide a better gold candidate than Mc-
Kinley. We can do it, and if we name the
right man I sometimes think we can win.
Democrats of the East, as well as Republicans,
favor a low tariff and a gold standard. I be
lieve many Republicans would vote with us
providing we nominate a better gold and
tariff man than McKinley.
I am a laboring man â employe of the South
ern Pacific Railroad; salary $1 85 per day. 1
am sorry to see my party go crazy, but I refuse i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 1896.
to go crazy in order to remain in good stand
ing. Let bimetallism tro to the dogs unless it be
limited bimetallism, as we have now. I would
have the gold standard with as much Â»ilver as
coula be safe'y assimilated. Grover Cleveland
is our iogica.l candidate, but it would be an im
position to ask him to lead us again. He is
weary of abuse and villification and yet to-day
I look on him as the biggest and brainiest
American on earth. Please pardon me for
this presumption in addressing you. If I can
do anything to assist in organizing the opposi
tion to Bryanism aside from voting for McKin
ley I shall be giad to respond. Very truly,
Joseph Allen.
The following letters were also among
those read :
Petautma, August J8, 1896.
Hon. E. B. Pondâ Dear Sib: I notice in the
morning papers that a call for meeting of gold
Democrats has been made for Tuesday even
ing. I regret that I cannot be present.
In my judgment we are facing the most ter
rible financial crisis we have seen in this coun
try. I have made political economics my
study for years, including this question of
stiver.
I Delieve that the free coinage of silver would
produce a disaster to the ;country only equaled
by the Civil War. I had made up my mind
under the circumstances to vote lor McKinley,
though a life-long Democrat.
1 trust your meeting may be harmonious,
braye, and with a sincere desire to maintain
the honor of the Nation, may adopt such plans
of action as will save the Democratic party
from oblivion. I remain, very truly yours,
E. 8. Lir-PiTT.
Los Anoeles, Cal., Vug. 14, 1896,
Hon. E. B. Pond. San Franciscoâ Deae Sir:
Myseif and other Democrats here, who are
sound-money men and cannot suDScribe to the
anarchistic doctrines promulgated by the Chi
cago convention, desire to act in hnrmony
with our Democratic brethren who are of the
same mind. I would be glad to know irom you
what action is contemplated by such Demo
crats in your City, and 1 know of no one whose
suggestions would meet with Kreatfr consid
eration than any you may make. Very truly
yours, W. J. Hunsakee.
BUCKLEYITES AND SILVER.
The General Committee Hears
Eloquence From Los
Angeles.
The Buckley general committee held
a meeting last evening in its hall at 324
Ellis street, which crowded the hall to the
doors, but no proceedings of great signifi
cance resulted.
-It was ordered that district nominations
for election officers for ' the primary elec
tion on September 1 must be submitted to
the executive committee by Thursday
evening. ... ...
P. F. Dundon, who always registers a
kick when he gets a chance, made a mild
observation to the eftect that he thought
September 3' a ' pretty early date for , the
municipal convention. He knew that the
reason given was that it was important to
get the issue between the local Democratic
factions before the Supreme Court at an
early date, but he said that he had been
told by a lawyer that when the Buckley
ticket was presented to Registrar Hinton
he could take his own time to say whether
or not he would recognize it as the
"regular" Democratic ticket, and ; by his
official answer furnish the basis for a test
case. BSB^SffBOSpi
Mr. Dundon was informed by M. J.
Donovan and by Chairman Rothschild
that he must have consulted a curb
stone attorney, because the law plainly
said that upon the presentation ot the
party ticket the Registrar must make his
answer "forthwith," and Mr. Dundon was
silenced by the overwhelming evidence
given in support of the early convention
and the sure victory of the Buckley fac
tion in the courts. ; . : I ;. .
J. Marion Brooks, chairman of the Los
Angeles Democratic County Committee,
was present as a guest and- he grossly
abused the courtesies he owed to the meet
ing by declaring as the chief point in his
address on silver that once a "fellow" was
sold for thirty pieces of and that if
silver was once good for the purchase of a
god it must be good for any purpose to
day. * -
j. D. Lynch of Los Anpeles followed in
a quite able and eloquent speech in behalf
of the Bryan and silver cause and then
the meeting adjourned. â ;_",. .

11. F. Stnltz, Butcher, Fined 810 For
Exposing; Diseased Meat For Sale.
H. F. Stoltz, the butcher at 510 Castro
street, arrested Sunday night for slaugh
tering a cow outside the regular limits and
exposing diseased meat for sale, appeared
before Justice of the Peace Carroll in Judge
Conlan's court yesterday.
When the cases were called Meat In
spector Davis announced that the defend
ant was willing to plead guilty, and he
therefore asked that a light' fine be im
posed.
Prosecuting Attorney Mogan thought
such an offense merited severe punish
ment, but Justice Carroll decided to follow
the suggestion of the Meat Inspector and
imposed the light sentence of $10 or ten
days iv the County Jail on one charge and
dismissed the other charge against the de
fendant.
Reception to Bfisa Parrlah.
A reception, to which the public is cordially

SMILEY CHARGES FUSION
The Ex - Registrar Makes a
Strong Fight Against the
Measure.
CRESWELL'3 IDEA ADOPTED.
A Test of tb.3 Registration Regula
tions May Bs Mf.de Eefore the
Supreme Court.
Ex-Registrar of Voters T. J. Jj. Smiley
battled valiantly yesierday against the
scheme of the Board of Election Commis
sioners â which, by the way, ii controlled
by a Democratic majorityâ to give the
Popnli"t party two representatives, but
his efforts were in vain, and unless some
change occurs between now and election
day each election board will have five Re
publican, five Democratic and two Popu
list members, or practically, in view of the
fusion between the two last-named parties,
seven Democratic members.
True to his promise, given at the last
meeting of the commission, City ana
County Attorney Creswell brought up hi 3
resolution s giving the Populists recogni tion
and read it as follows:
Eesolved, That in the City and County of
San Francisco at the next general and munici
pal election the officers of election shall be
nppointed as follows, viz.: In each precinct
t tie Democratic and Republican parties shall
each have one inspector, one judge, one clerk,
one additional clerk and one ballot clerk; the
Populist party shall have an Inspector and one
judge.
Resolved, That, inasmuch as the Democratic
party nas already received by appointment of
thia board one inspector and one judge and
the Republican party one judge, each of said
last named parties shall have the following
additional appointments, viz: The Democratic
party one clerk, one additional clerk and one
ballot clerk for each precinct ; the Republican
party one inspector, one clerk, one additional
clerk and'one ballot clerk for each precinct.
Mr. Smiley took up the cudgels the in
stant he was recognized by the chair, and
protested strongly agninst the adoption of
any such measure. He said that the fact
was well known to all that the Democrats
and Populists were in accord. Under the
circumstances, it would be totally unfair
to the party that he represented to allow
the Populists two representatives on each
board. The officers should be divided be
tween the two big parties. The Demo
crats and Populists, he said, were prac
tically one party, and it would be mani
festly unjust to give one party seven
representatives and the other only five.
In spite of Mr. Smiley's objections the
measure was adopted unanimously, the
only Republican member, City Surveyor
Tilton, explaining his vote by saying that
the majority of the election board officers
were bound, from the complexion of trft
commission, to be Domocratic anyway.
He did not see what difference one officer
made.
The matter of citations to prospective
voters to appear and show cause why their
names should be removed from the doubt
ful list was then taken up. It was decided
to instruct the Registrar to place special
delivery stamps on each envelope, so that
the commission can be satisfied that those
who are under suspicion receive their no
tices to appear. The hearing of these mat
ters will be begun on Wednesday next and
continued daily until ail of the cases are
disposed of.
Bishop Foreman, a well-known com
mercial traveler of this City, will uot vote
at the coming election because he failed
to register before leaving on one of his
trips about the State. He was in San Luis
Obispo when the thought struck him that
be would like to vote, and he wrote to a
friend asking him to register the name of
Bishop Foreman by proxy. How the
friend managed to carry out the commis
sion is a mystery, but he did so, and the
Commissioners took the name oft the list
yesterday because of the law that prohibits
such proceedings.
The Commissioners received word that
proceedings would be begun to test the
question us to whether the Legislature has
the right to restrict the time in which
voters can register to eighty-five days
before election.
A number of men who have been de
prived of their franchise to vote will apply
to the Supreme Court for a settlement of
the question.
Suit* Against Quarryi nen<
G. F. Gray and H. N. Gray yesterday brought
suit against Julian C. and Byron Digging and
against Joseph Scheerer and Emil V. Seheerer
to restrain them from further excavating in
their respective certain stone quarries owned
by the defendants on President street and
near Albany avenue. They have already cut
150 feet below the established grades of the
streets, it is alleged, and have greaily injured
the abutting property of the plaintiffs. An in
junction was secured.

BEARDED THE LION
IN HIS DEN,
A Burglar Visits the Resi
dence of Captain
Lees.
TAKES AWAY NOTHING.
His Description Leads to the
Arrest of Two of His
Accomp ices.
STOLEN PEOPERTY RECOVERED.
The Gang Believed to Ba the
Perpetrators of Numerous
Burglaries Recently.
Numerous burglaries have been com
mitted recently on Nob Hill, in the
Western Addition and in the Mission, and
the staff of detectives and several police
men in plain clothes have been working
hard to capture the burglars.
Four men were strongly suspected, but
it was not until Saturday niÃht that sus
picion developed into a certainty, afld two
of theÂ«gang and a woman were arrested.
The residence of William S. Duval,
general agent of the Continental Insur
ance Company, 1012 Pine street, was en
tered on the night of Sunday, August 2.
The family had cone into the country the
previous day, and the burglars were able
to loot the house undisturbed. They car
ried off jewelry and other articles valued
at $760. The burglary was discovered on
the following day, when Mrs. Duval re
turned from the country, and was reported
to the police.
Captain Lees' residence ie in the same
block, being 1022, and the burglary in the
Duval residence being in such close
proximity opurred on the police to greater
etforts to arrest the burglars. But some
thing else occurred to add greater stimu
lus to these efforts.
One of the gang had the audacity to
"beard the lion in his den," or in other
words to pay an early morning visit to the
residence of Captain Less. This was the
last straw, and the captain gave per
emptory orders that the bold gang must
be captured at all hazards.
About 2 o'clock last Saturday morning
Policeman Ingham, the officer on the
beat, happened to be passing the captain's
residence and heard a noise as if some one
had jumped off a lence in the rear. He
made his way to the rear and made a
careful search;of the yard, but was unable
to discover any stranger lurking around.
The sergeant came along and Injiham told
him of the noise he had neard. Both men
went again to the rear, but no one couid
be seen.
ingham derided to secrete himself
across the street in the hope that tne
burglar would make his appearance when
there was apparently nobody around.
About twenty minutes to 4 o'clock a young
man dressed in a light overcoat came
along Pine street at a rapid gait and
opened the gate leadine to Captain Lees'
residence. As he was mounting the sicds
Ingham ran across the street from his
hidintc place and hailed him with the
question, "What are you doing there?"
The burglar was equal to the emergency
and he quicKly replied: "That's all right;
I belong here." He walked up the re
maining steps, coolly inserted a key ia
the front door and entered the house.
Ingbam was nonplused by the burglar's
coolness. He knew Captain Lees and his
son Fred, the License Collector, but he
aid not know the captain's son-in-law,
wlio lives in the house, and he thouzht
the stranger might be the son-in-law. He,
however, decided to go back to hi* hiding
place thinking that if the stranger was a
burglar he would come out of the house
and then it would be easy to arrest him.
But he waited in vain.
The burglar was evidently scared by his
unexpected encounter witn Ingham. He
did not take time to matte a selectiou of
the captain's bric-a-brnc, but walked up
stairs and along the hallway to the rear
where there is a window ou a level with a
shed. He opened the window, stepped on
to the shed and slipped over the wail into
the next house to the east. The lady who
occupies this house had been awakened
by the noise made by Inghum and the
sergeant two hours before, and could not
sleep again. She heard the burglar as he
dropped into her yard, and saw him walk
across her yard and climb over the fence
into the adjoining yard. Then he changed
his mind and climbed back into her yard,
possibly with the intention of re-entering
the captain's house by the opea window.
As he got into the lady s yard she
opened the window through wnich she
had been looking and asked him what he
was doing there. He did not reply, but
hurriedly scaled the wall to the east and
disappeared from her view. It is sup
posed he climbed over the fences till he
reached Taylor street, thereby eluding the
vigilance of Policeman Ingham.
The captain got a good description of the
burglar from Ingham and the lady next
door, which led to the identity cf the gang,
and Detectives Gibson and Wren soon lo
cated them iv a house on Grant avenue.
They detailed Policemen Peshon and
Adams to watch the house. They arrested
Kate Brown, a young woman who lived
with one of the gang, and on searching
her room they found nearly all the jew
elry stolen from the Duval residence. She
was taken to the City Prison and detained
as a witness.
Later in the night Gibson and Wren ar
rested Patrick Kelly and Wiliiam Mar
tin, two ex-convicts and members of the
gang, and the detectives and others are
still hunting for the other two.
The residence of George W. Warren,
725 Eddy street, was broken into Friday
afternoon while the family was in the
country, and looted. The full extent of
the loss will not be known till the family
returns. This gang is supposed to have
"done the job."
They are supposed to have gone in pairs
and the two not yet captured are believed
to be the men who broKe into the residence
of A. C. Boldemann, 2634 Howard street,
Saturday night. Mr. Boldemann and
family went to the Columbia Theater,
and on returning found the pantry window
in the rear open and about |400 worth of
jewelry missing besides several relics
which were of great value to the family
owing to their associations.
Leroy Harvey ou Trial.
The impaneling of the jury in the case of
the People agalnat Leroy G. Harvey for em
bezzlement consumed all the afternoon yester
day in Judue Bahrs' court. Harvey is charged
with appropriating to his own use seventy-five
shares of stock of the Oakland Gas, Light and
Heat Company, valued at $40 per share. The
case will come on for trial to-day. Harvey is
being defended by Dorn & Dora.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 24â Speculation at
the Stock Exchange was dull and professional to
day. Only 100,0'Jl shares of stock were traded
In, while dealings in railway and miscellaneous
bonds footed up $310,000, both unusually small
totals. The fluctuations were on a par with the
transactions, very lew stocks changing as much as
a point during the day. At the opening The market
was weak on moderate seliinÂ« for London and
local account. V.'estei n I nion was quite a feature
a- Ihe s;;<rt, 1500 shuns changing -bands at 747, 8
73Vfc. On Sittirlav the lasi transaction! recorded
at 7&3/ 8 . The veiling of telegraph had little in
fluence on :he cererat list, and before .he expira
tion o. the first hour of business the entire list
was Oil the a .' vance otic? more.
The buying was b:iseii on the idea that the
f "lf-anng-house committee intended to issue cer
tificates at their mi-eting to-day. It was agreed
that this action would be of material assistance to
merchants who are unable to place their paper at
present and . that the security marke;s would re
flect ;he improvement in mercantile circles later
on. The traders then began to discount a probable
issue of certificates and their noderatr purchases
soon Drought about a general advance in prices.
Manhattan bounded up 3% to "si.4, but this was
exceptional. Western Union recovered from 73 1 /2
to 75%. and Susar, the Grangers, Louisville and
.Nashville rose -Vi(<il% percent.
Renewed weakness in sterling exchange en
couraged the hope of fresh Importations of goll,
and this also had some influence in bringing
about the higher range oi stock quota' ions- The
demand from the shorts fell off toward the close
and there was a disposition to pur out fresh con
tracts in a small way. Money on call rose to 8 par
cent,- but under offerings by a foreign bouse the
rate quickly returned to 6 per cent.. After bor
rowers had supplied their wants there were lend
ers as low as 3Â®4 per cent. At the close the stock
market was tolerably " firm, except for Sugar and
the (Grangers.
Net change* in the active stocks were slight
. either tray, outside of Manhattan, which gained
1 ' â > per cent, and sugar, which lost 1 per cent. In

CHICAGO MAKKtIy
CHICAGO, 111.. Aug. â The bull enthusiasm
in wheat which became so prominent on Saturday
was remarkable by its absence from the trade at
the opening this morning. The 'fact that quite a
heavy line of short property was covered through
the medium of ."calls" eliminated an important
strengthening factor, and buyers were not quite so
confident of a further advance. The visible sup
ply was an object of some attention while the fig
ures were in receipt, but the final result, a de
crease of 687,000 bushels, was not important,
either 1 from a bullish or bearish standpoint. Re
ceipts at Chicago were 167 cars and 114. 195 bush
els were taken from store. 1 he Northwest had 354
cars, against 308 last Monday and 608 a year ago.
Liverpool quotations were higher to correspond to
our advance of Saturday. The amount on ocean
passage increased 80, C 00 bushels.
The world's shipments were estimated at 5,665,
-000 bushels. After opening fairly steady the
market gradually eased off, as it became apparent
that information was not particularly cheering to
holders. In the afternoon there was a strength
ening of the tone on an advance in wheat of from
20 to 36 centimes and in flour of from 35 centimes
to 1 franc 25 centimes at Paris. Antwerp closed
25 centimes higher, and Berlin from unchanged
to V* mark lower. Export clearances amounted
to 145.241 bushels. Tne Engltih visible supply
increased 110,000 bushels. A fair- business in
cash wheat was reported. Weakness again as
sailed prices at the close and the recovery was
lost. December wheat opened from 61%'j to 6iygc,
sold between 613/^c and 60% c closing at 61Vs c >
V 8@ 1 under Saturday. Estimated receipts tor
to-morrow 275 cars.
CuÃNâ With the execution of a moderately
large number of orders at the opening the corn
market settled Into the crstomary rut, and inac
tivity was the only noticeable feature of the trade
subsequently. Receipts were 755 cars and 923,
-391 bushels were withdrawn from store. Liver
pool caoles were firm and unchanged. Wheat
changes in prices occurred reflecting the tone and
feeling of wheat. The visible supply increased
360.000 bushels and the amount on ocean passage
1.680,000 bushels. Export clearances aggregated
293,034 bushels. May corn opened at 26% c > de
clined to 'J6(>B'ai26S4c, where it closed, L c under
Saturday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 950
cars.
OATSâ Developed nothing but dullness, and for
tone the motive was obtained from wheat. Re
ceipts were 391 cars. There were no withdrawals
from store. The visible supply decrease! 372,000
bushels. Export clearances were practically noth
ing: May oats closed i/ c to 14c lower. Esti
mated receipts for to-mono*. 426 cars.

PUuVISIONa â There was an unusually heavy
influx of hogs at the yards this morning, the na
tural effect of which was to weaken prices at that
place, and from the intimate relationship with
conditions there the product market ruled lower.
January pork closed 5c to 7%c lower, January
lard 2%c lower and January ribs 6c lower. '

He Knew Too Hnch,
"Did you ever," remarked the man who
deliehts in facetious antiquities, "hear of
the hayseed who went to the ticket office
and asked what time the 4 o'clock train
left?"
"Ha! Ha! Ha!" said his friends politely.
On the face of one of the bystanders
there was, however, no answering smile.
Instead there was the strained look of one
who fails to see the point.
"Well," he said, doubtfully, "what's
wrong with that?"
"Why, man alive, can't you see? It's
the worst kind of a chump question. What
answer would you expect?"
"Oh, I don't know. Maybe 5:45."
"My friend, whom do you find willing to
pay money for the use of your mental
powers?"
"Eh? Oh, you mean where do I work?
I'm ticket agent on the Middle and
Southern."
The healthiest children in the world
dwell in the Scottish Highlands. They
seldom wear shoes before they are 12 years
of age.

Interesting "Letters" to All Their

Oaklakd Office Saw Fkancisco Caxl,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 24. f
People who have experienced any trou
ble with streetcar employes, and they are
legion, will be interested in a little "letter"
that has Just been issued by the Hay
wards electric road. It marks a progress-
>o Matter HowCantankerons or Obstinate Passengers May Be, Conductors
Must Always Wear an Angelic Smile and Try to Please.
ive step both in the prestige and deport
ment of motormen and conductors. It
commences by stating that the advice if
followed "will be of great benefit to you
and will tend to make you more useful to
the company."
Above all things, the company does not
want "cranky" men, although it expects
every employe to be thoroughly familiar
with all the cranks and wheels of the ma
chinery under bis control. A conductor
must certainly have a temper like Job if
he honestly acts up to the advice regard
ing being pleasant
"When asked for information," it says,
"hasten to give all that you can, A con
ductor can, by being cranky, drive travel
from the railway, just the same as a clerk
in a store can drive trade away.
"Urbanity is capital, without which no
business can be successfully carried on.
"Passengers do not always like to make
requests, and their wants should be antici
pated.
"Do not get out of temper when a pas
senger happens to take offense, but rather
make an effort to appease him and please
him."
Something new is found in the rule
about putting an obnoxious passenger off
the car. Before ejecting him the con
ductor is to use every means to pursuade
him to be a gentleman, and if this has no
effect then return his fare and bounce
him. The return of tne fare is a new
feature.
The poor conductor has another task
which is not any more pleasant. He is
advised as follows:
Should a light of glass be broken while a car
is in your charge endeavor to collect $1 50
from the person breaking it. If he refutes ask
him his name and address, and when you
turn your car in make a full and detailed ac
count of it and drop it in the time-card box.
No conductor is to discriminate between
the lady who is fair, fat and fifty and the
dainty maiden who is attending a picnic
at San Lorenzo Grove. He is told to be
"ready at all times to assist ladies, both
old and young, in alighting or getting on
a car; also help them with bundles, etc.,
always being careful when assisting a
lady to do so in such a manner ai not to
give offense. Always try to find seats for
passengers by making children 'double
up, 1 or by having their parents take them
on their laps."
The conductor is dismissed with one
rcore word of advice, doubtless the result
of a talk to a newspaperman in the past.
Here is the rule: "You must not under
any circumstances discuss an accident ex
cepting when ordered to do fÂ»o by the su
perintendent."
The motorman is no longer to be re
garded as a "streetcar man." He will be
expected to be somewhat of an electrician
and more of a machinist. Among other
things the "Letter to Motormen" contains
the following:
His not enough for a motorman to know
how to turn the current off and on, but he
should be thoroughly familiar with the ma
chinery on bis car, in order to economically
operate the same. It will be but a question of
time until a motorman will be required to
take an examination similar to that of an en
gineer. It -is a well-known fact that a man
who understands the parts of an electric motor
is able to operate the same more economically
than he who does not understand them.
It a man wants to make it his busiaess to run
a motor, and tnereby earn his living, he
should thoroughly understand his business.
It is not necessary for a man to be an electri
cian, yet he should understand biÂ« motors. It
is expected that soon every car will have a re
cording Wait meter; then every motorm&n
will be held accountable for an excessive use
of current, and if he does not know enough to
run his car with economy he cannot expect to
be retained in the service of this company.
Motormen will clearly see that it is to their in
terests to study and become thoroughly fa
miliar with everything in connection
with the motors. There are a great
many good books on the subject of
f:eciricity which can be purchased
cheaply, and which, if studied by them
will greatly aid them in operating their cars
by teaching them the uses of the various
wires and other parts of the motors. When a
man understands that the welfare of himself,
and possibly of his fomily, depends upon his
efforts, it should spur him on to increased en
deavors, and he should taKe hold of his work
as ii it was a pleasure to him, and not as if his
sole aim in life was to kill time while on duty.
Carelessness loses many positions.
The last piece of advice is self-explana
tory:
"In case of any tronble between passen
ger and conductor (should your services
be required) you will give the conductor
all the assistance in your power."
FOOTPADS CAUGHT.
Palled a Man Off a Street Car and
Bobbed Him in East
Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 24.â Raphael
Massar of San Francisco reported to the
police at 11 o'clock last night that he had
been pulled off of a Fruitvale electric car
at Commerce andÂ» East Twenty-third
streets by two highwaymen and robbed of
$2, all the money he had with him at the
time. No one saw the deed and the passen
ger was not even missed.
Officers Jacobus and Kingsbury were in
structed to look into the matter. In the
struggle Massar had lost his hat and
secured one belonging to his assailants.
On seeing this Jacobus recognized it as be
longing to Henry Lawson, whom he had
seen wearing it during the evening. With
Lawson at the time was Henry Callaghan.
The officers know both men as having
records and that they were often about Ed
Tye's house on East and Twenty-second
streets, near Commerce.
The officers went to Tye's and found
both men in bed, but Wassar's hat was in
the room. Both were made to dress and
were sent to the City Prison. This morn
ing Wassar called and identified the men
as the ones who had assaulted him, and
swore to complaints charging them with
highway robbery. Motorman Moir called
also and identified them as passengers on
the trip mentioned.
Lawson is the last of three brothers.
Fred, the oldest, was shot in Los Angeles
about eighteen months ago and Charles
was found dead in an opium joint here
about a year ago. Henry is an ex-convict,
with two prior convictions to his credit.
Callagban is a petty larcenist of local
note. They were allowed until Wednes
day to consult an attorney.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 1896.
MISTAKEN FOR A
MIDNIGHT THIEF,
He Was Shooting a Skunk
That Had Attacked
His Dog.
ANDREW HAVES' ESCAPE
Shot At While Investigating a
Disturbance in His Chicken-
House.
BOTH ANIMALS WERE GAME.
The Presence of the Odoriferous Pest
So Near the City a SurÂ«
prise to All.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 24. )
Andrew Hayes was shot at last night
near his home under circumstances that,
so long as they did not end tragically,
may be regarded as funny.
It was tne result of a midnight battle
between a dog and a large skunk which
took dace in the grounds surrounding
Andrew Hayes' residence near Trestle
Glen.
The dog, was victorious, but not before a
stubborn fight bad takefi place was the
skunk Killed. When measured it was
found to be twenty-eiuht inches long,
which is the biggest ono of its kind killed
in thiÂ» county for many years. In fact so
rare have these odoriferous pests been for
along time that it was hoped they were
extinct so far as Alameda County was con
cerned.
The dog which is a valuable pointer, at
tacked the skunk and the two were fight
ing fiercely when Andrew Hayes was at
tracted by the noise. The scene of the
strife was beneath a low platform near the
chicken-house at the Hayes place on Wat
son avenue near Brooklyn.
After severely wounding his antagonist,
the dog could stand his surroundings no
longer, and running to a pile of ashes he
buried his nose in it. Hayes got his gun
and a couple of charges of shot ended the
skunk's suffering. He then turned his at
tention to bis dog, and for half an hour he
played a garden hose on his favorite.
After that the dog ran to Late Merritt
and spent several hours swimming for the
purpose of trying to forget that he had
been so near so ill-favored an antagonist
"I never saw a skunk act so meanly in
my life," said Mr, Hayes to-day. "I have
not seen a skunk in this neighborhood for
a long time, and it must have been a very
vicious animal or my dog would never
have gone near it. The beast was very
sick, though, when I shot it. Our place is
about a quarter of a mile this side of Tres
tle Glen, and was thought to be free of
such pests.
"The worst part of it all was the excite
ment that it caused. When the neighbors
heard the shots at midnight they came
out with their guns, and it was only by a
lucky cnance that I did not suffer. I had
been attracted from my room by the noise
of the dog, and supposing that robbers
were around I took my gun with me.
"When some of the neighbors saw a
man with a gun in the moonlight they
at once supposed that I was a robber,
and a shot went whizzing past danger
ously close to my arm. I had to shout to
save my own life, and I am not wanting
any more skunks around here at mid
night."
WILL FIGHT FOR HONOR,
Berkeley Freshmen and Sophc
mores Prepared for Their
Rush To-Night.
Odds in Favor of the Freshmenâ C p
tain Ransome Will M?et the
Football Men.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 24.â Tue fresh
men and sophomores of the State Uni
versity have everything in readiness for
their great annual "rush," which will
take place to-morrow evening at 8 o'clock
on the football grounds. Each of the two
classes held meetings this afternoon and
made final arrangements for the battle.
The juniors admonished all the fresh
men to turn out and make their victory,
of which they seem reasonably certain, as
overwhelming as possible, and the seniors
advised the sophomores to keep up cour
age and fight to the bitter end, notwith
standing the odds in the way of numbers
tney will be forced to work against.
The freshmen Bay they can get together
200 fighting men who -jrill stay by the
"00" banner until it is trailed in the
dunt. The sophomores do not believe
they can call out as many as this, but say
that their experience will counterbalance
their lack of numbers.
All day long the rival classes have been
gathering together baling rope and twine
with which to bind the vanquished. After
the right is over and the defeated classmen
are piled in a heap the customary war
dance about them by tue victors and their
supporting upper class will be observed.
The usual rumor that the faculty will
take a hand in the affair and call a halt if
matters become too lively went abroad to
day.
if the evening be a clear one, it is ex
pected that at least three thousand
spectators will be on the scene to witness
the spilling of gore and the straining of
collegiate muscle.
Will Meet Football Hen,
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 24.â Captain
Rausome will meet prospective football
players for the coming season to-morrow
afternoon in Harmon gymnasium. This
will be the first official meeting of Berke
ley football men this year, and it is anti
cipated that a large number will be pres
ent, especially representatives from the
tresbmen class. This class contains a large
number of big men, eighty of whom stand
over six feet in their stockings, and who
seem eminently fitted for work on the
gridiron.
May Lfsse the Cottages.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 24.â 50 many
of the classrooms at the State University
have become decidedly overcrowded since
the advent of the class of 1900 that it
seems necessary that the cottages on the
south side of the grounds belonging to the
university, but now occupied by some of
its officers, will have to be pressed into
service for holding recitations.
Moat of the cottages have for many years
been occupied by professors and em
ployes of the university, but gradually it
has become necessary to have them va
cated in order that they mieht be used for
recitation-rooms and other university pur
poses. At present one of them is used by
the dining association, another is used as
the university printing offioe, and still
another was used as a recitation room and
called the French cottage before it burned.
The chemistry building, which was one
of the last to be erected on the campus, is
overcrowded beyond all expression, and
North Hall is filled almost to suffocation.
To Choose Delegates.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Aug. 24.â The Popu
lists of the Fifty-first Assembly District,

BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 24.â The mem

tion to tbe Students' Republican Club
asking the privilege of introducing a

the special meeting this afternoon on the
issues of the day.

The Times is once more in tronble. This
old newspaper was the first daily journal
to be established in this city, and, like
many other "pioneer" journals, seems to
be doomed to periodical wreckage.
A few weeks ago it passed into the
hands of Gavin Dhu High. Mr. High's
aggressive policy soon brought about a
couple of libel suits by W. J. Dingee. The
tir.^t of these was tried a month ago, ana
the editor was fined $250 and ordered to
jail for five days. He appealed, and the
case is still pending. The second case is
set for Wednesday.
This afternoon Mr. High published the
following little notice:
I have to-day sold the Oakland Times and
Evening Item and retire from their manage
ment to nil an important position on a San
Francisco paper. Gavin Dhu High.
The Item was an offshoot of the Times,
that appeared about two months ago. The
editor of both papers came under the ban
of the directors of the Board of Trade,
and a movement was introduced at the
last meeting to drop him from the rolls.
It is said that the Merchants' Exchange
was about to adopt a similar measure.
Tne Times has not passed into other
hands yet, but has reverted to the banks
that hold mortgages against it. Its future
is not yet settled. It was stated to-day
that Gavin High's retirement was due to
the banks, but Mr. Pratner says it was the
result of an inability to make it pay ex
penses.
"I shall not relax the prosecution of my
libel suits," said Mr. Dingee to-night, "be
cause High has left the paper, but shall
vindicate my character to the fullest ex
tent. I have several other libel suits that
I snail bring, and if Mr. High is within
reach of the State courts he will be tried
for his doings."
It was reported to-night that Mr. Dingee
had decided to swear out warrants for
libel agaiust some prominent people who,
it is alleged, have been joint owners with
High in the Times.
"I only spoke once to Mr. High." said
Mr. Dingee to-day, "and then 1 told him
I felt sure that he was being encouraged
to publish his infamous stories concerning
me, and that if he would tell me who they
were that were using such means to an
noy me I would not press for a heavy sen
tence. At that time he refused to tell me."
PAULINO READY TO EAT
Thinks He Can Vanquish Miller,
the Champion Egg-Con
sumer.
The Bootblack on the Ferry Steamer
Tiburon Out With a Chal
lenge.
Since Ernest Miller, the butcher in the
employ of Dri & Co., the Clay-street
butchers, vanquished Sam Browney, the
stableman, in an egg-eating contest in a
Clay-street bakery, the craze for cham
pionship honors in the gastronomic line
has been rampant and more than one as
pirant has announced his willingness to
devour hen fruit for coin and fame.
Most of these aspirants have been dis
couraged' because of their well-known
paucity of square meals, but one man has
com? to the front whose claims for recog
nition cannot be ignored. He is a boot
black, but an eater of mighty attainments
and moreover his friends are ready with
funds to back him.
Goiseppi Paulino shines shoes on the
steamer Tihnron and incidentally con
sumes all of the available food in the gal
ley when his time to eat arrives. As re
muneration for lighting the fire in the
steamer's restaurant range and cleaning
the kitchen he is allowed to eat ad libitum,
and this is what he generally consumes:
Two plates of soup, two Jarge platters of
meat and vegetables, one large loaf of
broad, a soup plate full of cucumbers and
tomatoes, three cups of coffee to wash
down a dozen or more of doughnuts and
all the fruit that is left over from the
previous day.
This is simply tor breakfast and the
other two meals of the day are in propor
tion. Even after these feats in tho eating
line Guiseppi often announces that his
hunger is unappeased, and that a few
plates of spaghetti would still be accept
able.
When Miller's fame as an egg-eater
went abroad Paulino was asked by his
shipmates aboard the vessel whether sixty
five eggs would fill his ever present cavity.
"Notta much," replied the doughty
bootblack. "I eata seventy-five any time."
The satisfied friends cf the bootblack at
once made up a purse of $25, which they
are willing to increase to $35, that Paulino
will not only outeat Miller to the extent
of 10 epjgs, but that he will accomplish the'
demolition of the hen fruit in twenty
minutes less than the cadaverous butcher.
Man and money are ready at the Tiburon
ferry at any time that the steamer is in, and
a match can be arranged at short notice.

UNEARTHED AN
ANCIENT TOMB
An Interesting Discovery
at the Oakland Race-
Track.
QUEER INDIAN SKULLS.
Their Remarkable Formation
Interests Frofessor Meriam
of Berkeley.
ONE THOUSAND YEARS OLD.
President Williams' Museum of Ancient
Anatomy at the California
Jockey Club.
The Oakland racetrack is at the present
moment a happy hunting ground for en
thusiastic archaeologists, a state of affairs
directly due to a most important discovery
recently made in that locality. This is
nothing less than an unusually fruitful
specimen of what is commonly termed the
shell-mound or kitchen midden, now gen
erally admitted to be the burial ground of
presumably autochthonous Indian tribes
loog ago extinct. Mounds of this descrip
tion have frequently been found in many
parts of California, and in fact all along
the Pacific Coast, but in this particular in
stance the discovery referred to is of such
a character as to suggest to the eye of an
expert much greater antiquity than the
average type.
This opinion is held by Professor Meriam
of the Berkeley University among others.
He was notified of the find without delay,
and has secured two skulls for examina
tion and preservation in the university
museum.
About a week ago George Bleasdale, who
Skull of Strange Conformation Discovered in a Berkeley Shell Monnd.
is the foreman of the work of improve
ment now in progress on the Oakland
racetrack, began to level the monnd in
question in order to crepare a site for tne
new stables, and also to obtain earth to
fill up another portion of the track.
Hardly had the workmen begun to dig
tban one of them, more fortunate than the
rest, like the gravediggers in "Hamlet,"
â¢udden'y unearthed a skull.
Thomas H. Williams, president of the
California Jockey Club, and A. M. Allen,
superintendent of the work, soon heard of
the occurrence and immediately visited
the scene of the discovery. Both gentle
men seemingly take keeninterestin the ab
struse subject of shell mounds, and eagerly
determined to thoroughly investigate the
nature of this particular sample of the
species. A hole was accordingly dug some
six feet in depth and not more than seven
feet in diameter, and within this com
paratively small space fully eight skulls
in a more or less perfect state of preserva
tion were brought to light, as well as a
large quantity of bones from other por
tions oi the human frame, as for example
bits of the spinal column, hip and tnigh
bones.
The whole of the mound is otherwise
composed of clam, mussel and oyster
shells in a state of decomposition arid is
estimated to be at ieasl 200 yards la diam
eter.
One marked peculiarity of all the skulls
which have thus far been unearthed is the
peculiar formation of their upper portion
above tlie eye-sockets. As will be seen
from the accompanying sketch the own
er's head must have been entirely devoid
of wb.it moderns call the forehead and
that it recedes abruptly, thus indicating
an extremely low order of intelligence.
Moreover, the occipital part* are of enor
mous thickness and scarcely calculated to
be easily broken in time of war, which,
from the point of view of their happy

possessor, was, no doubt, a distinct ad
vantage. â¢
A representative of Thb Call visited the
racetrack yesterday afternoon and after
sundry inquiries was sufficiently fortunate
to light upon Georete Bleasdale, the fore
man of the improvement work, who very
courteously communicated all he knew
concerning this unique shell mound.
"We began to level it early last week,"
said he, "as we intend to use tue site for
the new stables and also require the earth
for rilling-in purposes. Eight skulls, I
think, were found in all, and as many as
four of these within ten inches of each
other, as well as hundreds of other bones.
Four of the eight skulls were fairly well
pieserved, but the remainder were broken
up into several pieces. Two professors
from the university were over here a few
days ago, and I understand that in tueir
opinion these relics arc at least a thousand
years old. Perhaps the site of this race
track was used by those old Indian tribes
as a battie-neld, and the mound was where
they afterwards buried their dead.
"One reason foi my thinking so is that
from the position in which we found the
bones it is certain that the bodies were
placed in the earth any how â some of them
upside down and all jumbled up together
in terrible confusion. The bones were
covered with finely powdered shells.
Seems to me," added Mr. Bleasdale, face
tiously, "that these fellows must have
feasted on clams, oysters and mussels
every time they had a funeral. Here's a
bit of a spinal column. If it originally
belonged to a human being be was evi
dently much bigger than we are nowa
days. You'll notice, too, that the teeth in
these skulls are very heavy and sharp â
made so artifically, no doubt. I've often
found shellmounds in this neighborhood,
but have never before seen skulls of the
same formation as these."
The original of the skull shown in the
sketch was kindly loaned by Thomas H.
Williams, the president of the California
Jockey Club, who intends to have it re
stored. When questioned on the subject
of the discovery he stated, that Professor
Meriam of Berkeley had taken possession
of two of the better preserved skulls, on
behalf of his faculty, and bad also ex
pressed his opinion as to the antiquity of
the mound in the terms previously quoted.
In the course of the next few days the
entire mound will be plowed up, when
further interesting developments may be
looked for. It is worthy of remark in this
connection that the examination of the
mound has yielded nothing in the shape
of domestic utensils or warlike weapons,
such as are often found in other mounds
of California.

AMERICAN ILLUSTRATORS.
Bow Gibson's Work Is Viewed by Eng
lishmen. â¢
In the little outer gallery of the Fine
Arts Society a few of C. Dana Gibson's
drawings are hanginsr. . Mr. Gibson, as Is
well known, is an American illustrator,
and in America artists who work in black
and white are less hampered by traditions
and conventions than they are here. It
has been, one , might say, a part of their
artistic creed that 1 the business of the
wood engraver or the process man is to re
produce 1 their drawings, and not theirs to
see that the reproduction is made as easy
and simple as possible. . They do not al
low themselves to be Bound by any hard
and-fast rules as to size lines or materials.
Mr Gibson works on a scale tnat woul^
take away the breath of the English pho
to-engraver, who looks upon the drafts
man as a mere slave of the foot-rule. But
so well does Mr. Gibson know what he is
doing that his drawings gain instead of
losing by reduction on the pages of tne
magazines; the originals are clever and
bold and free, but they are somewhat
wanting in the reprints after them. For
this reason the smaller single figures,
where there is do attempt at elaborate
composition, are here most etiarmine,

PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION AND PROSPERITY.
THE CAUSE OF
AMERICAN LABOR,
It Finds Its Earnest Cham
pion in the Repub
lican Party.
INTERESTING PROBLEM.
Relations of the Two Great Par
ties to the Toilers of
the Land.
THE LEADERS COMPARED.
The Future Prosperity of the Country
Is in the Keeping of the
Workingman.
There are in tbe United States fifteen
miilions of men and women who earn
their living by working for wages as dis
tinguished from salaries, and it is the
existence of this great wage-earning class
which makes the maintenance of society a
problem. So long as this great body of
men and women are employed steadily
and at good wages they and those de
pendent upon them are large consumers
of the product of factory and farm, and
this makes the factory prosperous, the
farm prosperous and every department of
business prosperous, for the wages of
working men and women are poured at
once into the channels of trade, making
money abundant and business good. It
used to be said that "when the farmer is
prosperous everybody is prosperous," but
it has more recently been discovered that
when the laborer is not prosperous no one
is prosperous and that the cause of labor
is the cause of all.
It will be remembered that in the par
able of the householder, when the pro
prietor came out to the gate at the
eleventh hour and inquired, "Why stand
ye here all the day idle?" the answer he
received wa3, "Because no man hath hired
us," and from that day until now there
has ever been the same answer to the
same question. If there are idle people it
is because there is no one to employ them,
and therefore in order that there may be
work lor those who want something to do
there must De something for the employers
of labor to do also. When there is nothing
that capital can do to make money there
is nothing that the laborer can do to earn
money, and again the "ca-use of one is the
cause of all" â the cause of the laborer is
the cause of the employer, and the canse
of both becomes the cause of the Republi
can party. Those parties and politicians
which profess great friendliness to labor
and hostility to capital are demagogues.
They champion labor's cause only that
they may get labor's votes. If there is to
be work to do there must, be some one to
furnish that work, and if there is no one
to hire labor then labor stands all the
day idle, business is dull, money tight,
prices are low and labor troubles convulse
the social system.
A ship sails out of the Golden Gate
bound for Liverpool and it carries away
3000 tons of wheat grown in the San
Joaquin Valley. The labor cost of pro
ducing a ton of wheat in the San Joaquin
Vali-y is about as follows: Plowing, 30
cents; harvesting, 80 cents; hauling to
the railway station, 30 cents; total on
board cars, $1 30. This wheat when
placed on board ship at Port Costa will be
worth about $1S per ton and the 3000-ton
cargo will be worth $54,000. Of this only
$3,900 will have been paid to farm labor
and $50,100 will go to other American in
terests, among which is the labor attend
ant upon hauling to Port Costa by rail and
loading aboard ship, for which services 50
cents per ton may reasonably be allowed,
half to the railroad men and half to the
longshoremen. This brings the total sura
paid to American labor out of the product
of 3000 tons of wheat up to $5400. All the
restâ $49,600 goes to other interests. If we
estimate a day's work on a California farm
to be worth $1, then that cargo of wheat
sent out of the Golden Gate represented
5400 days' work done in America and
whose product is to be exchanged for the
product of days' works done in some other
country.
Suppose that this cargo of American
wheat is taken to Sydney or Melbourne
and is there exchanged for scoured Aus
tralian wool. Of the cost of producing
scoured wool, baled and compressed ready
for shipment, 80 per cent goes to labor,
Rnd therefore the exchange, otherwise fair
and a good bargain for both countries,
would nevertheless mean $43,200 paid to
Australian labor in producing tne wool
against $5400 paid to American labor in
the production ot the wheat; 43,200 days'
work done in Australia at a dollar a day
and only 5400 done in America, and ye t
free-traders would have workingmen
believe that such an exchange is no injus
tice to American labor!
Or, suppose that this cargo of wheat
were sent to England instead of to Austra
lia, and there exchanged tor Bessemer
pigiron. The total labor cost of producing
a ton of pigiron at an ordinary English
furnace is $3 30, and a ton of pigiron at
the furnace will be worth about as much
as a ton of wheat on the cars at any inte
rior station in the San Joaquin Valley,
therefore our cargo of California wheat
will exchange for a cargo of pigiron ton
for ton. But in t'ne production of that
3000-ton cargo of English pigiron there
was paid out $9900 to English labor,
whereas in the production of 3000 tons of
California wheat and putting it on board
thÂ« cars in the San Joaquin Valley there
was paid to American labor only $3900, a
â¢i'fference of $6000. The production of
lie wheat gave the American workmen
0000 days 1 work at a dollar a dBy. The

production of the pigiron gave to English
labor 9900 days' work at a dollar a day,
and yet the wheat was exchanged for the ,
iron "even up," cargo for cargo, ton for
ton, and American labor was wronged by
tbe exchange.
So we see that every ship that comes to
our shores laden with goods made in an
other country brings not so mucn goods
as days' work done in tbe country from
which the ship sailed. Days' work done
eisewhere are not done in America, and
when tney are not done in America that
leaves just so many less days' work to be
done in America and by American work
men. If those days' work cculd not have
been done profitably in America, then no
wrong has been done to American labor;
but if they could have been done in
America to a reasonable advantage, and
were not because of a free-trade tariff
policy, then American labor has been
wronged, and grievously wronged. When
ever a raw product is exchanged for a
finished product American labor is cheat
ed, for the reason that less labor is re
quired to produce the raw than the fin
ished product. To quarry a block of
marble out of the ground and put it on a
car may consume a day and cost a dollar
and a half, but to fashion that marble
into a piece of statuary will require many
days and command many hundreds or
even thousands of dollars. The one is a
raw product of labor, the other is a fin
ished product of labor and art; and when
ever a suipload of American larni prod
ucts â wheat, corn, cattle â is sent abroad
and exchanged for scoured wool or woolen
goods, pigiron or steel rails, the exchange
means lew days' work done in America
(for machinery does the most of it) and
many days' work done in some other
country by other workmen.
Now tne McKinley policy is to safeguard
American labor in the only way possibleâ
by producing at home all the things which
can be produced at home to an advantage,
all those things in the production of which
the most labor is employedâ and the
things which cannot be produced in this
country to advantage, why, they are to
come in free of all duty, so that people can
get them just as cheap as possible. It was
because Mr. McKinley stood most promi
nently for this policy that the rank and
file of the Republican party demanded his
nomination, and never ceased their de
mands until he was nominated by over
whelming numbers. Mr. McKinley is a
thorough American, and, while he wants
to see all the world happy and prosperous,
he rightly believes that it is Americans
duty to look out for Americans and for the
interests of American labor. Other coun
tries can do the same. If Mr. McKinley is
elected â and tbe laboring men of America
must say whether he is to be elected or
not â the tariff on wool will be restored, so
that the sheep tenders, shearers, wool
scourers and pullers of America and not
Australia shall find something to do,
instead of "standing all day idle." The
tariff will be raised on woolen manufac
tures so that the woolen-mills of America,
70 per cent of which are now idle, may go
to work, and whatever other industry
needs protection will receive it. Every
cargo brought to our shores to be sold will
pay for the privileges of our markets, and
not be permitted to grind American labor
down to the foreign standard of wages and
of living. Money will be kept at home
which now goes eisewhere, and days' work
will be done at home by American laborers
which are now done elsewhere by foreign
laborers. This is what McKiniey stands
for.
On the 16th of March. 1892 (page 2355 of
the Congressional Record), Mr. Bryan
said: "1 want to say as emphatically as
words can state it that I consider it as
false in economy and vicious in policy to
attempt to raise at a higher price in this
country that which we can purchase
abroad at a lower price."
Again on the 20th of March, 1892, Mr.
Bryan assailed the protective theory as
follows : "I am not at this time complain
ing of a revenue tariff. What I denounce
is a protective tariff, levied primarily and
solely for purposes of protection. It is
false economy and the most vicious polit
ical principle that ever cursed this coun
try."
Ou the same occasion Mr. Bryan took
pains to declare nis position more ex
plicitly by saying: "When we give to the
manutacturer free raw materials and free
machinery we give to him, I think, all the
encouragement which a people acting
under a free government like oura can
legitimately extend to an industry. 1 '
In other" words, Mr. Bryan is a pure
free-trader and if elected will do all in his
power to abolish the protective system,
which strives to aid American labor by
having, so far as possible, all the things
consumed in our country produced here
by our own workmen and substitute for
that policy a policy which will seek to
have our wool all grown, scoured and
baled in Australia, taken to England and
manufactured into clothing and brought
here and exchanged for food products
which are created with little manual labor
and much machinery and horses, leaving
our American laborers to "stand all the
day idle" because "no man hath hired
them," the hiring beine done in another
country and the wages being paid to
another people. Workingmen of Califor
nia, can there be any question as to which
of these men is your friend and represents
your interests?
Under which banner are yon going to
enlist for this campaign? Will it be
under the banner of a hybrid organization
which has abandoned principle and ven
tured all in a desperate effort to retain
office ? Will yon intrust your welfare and
that of your country to a leader who is an
avowed iree-trader; a man who does not
believe in protecting home industries or
home labor, and so declares; a theorist, a
dreamer and a man without practical ex
perience in the executive affairs of gov
ernment? If so, Bryan is your man and
the "popocratic" party is your party and
its ticket is your ticket.
Or will you enlist under the banner of a
party which for thirty-five years has de
fended the Nation and the credit of the
Nation against assaults from within or
without? A party which, having freed
the slave, also made irea from a competi
tion which wouid have degraded and per
haps enslaved the workingman of
America, and raised his earnings from a
y arly per capita of $288 in 1860 to $484 in
1890, making the American workingman
at once the largest producer and largest
consumer of products on the earth? And
what manner of man is William McKin
ley ? He is a man ripe in years, ripe in
experience, both as a legislator in Con
gress and as an executive of one of the
great States of America; a boy soldier,
but a man orator whose weighty declara
tions tor a score of years have been potent
in the council halls of his country; a man
who has made a profound study of the
well-being of those who toil because early
convinced of the supreme truth that the
Nation could not fare well while the
toilers who do the Nation's work were
faring ill, the cause of the workincrrnan
being the cause of all. The only guaranty
lor the future is the past, and the only
warranty which any man or party can
give to the people who are asked for their
suffrages is the record which such party
and its candidate has builded up. The
record of the Republican party and the
record of William McKinley are both open
books which those who run may read, and
this party and this man are the only party
and the only candidate for the Presidency
who are running on their record in this
campaign. Therefore, you who toil that
you may live, work and talk and vote for
McKinley and prosperity. Your own
future and that of your country is in your
keeping.

FREE TRADE IS
EUROPE'S FRIEND,
Fallacies of Democratic
Doctrines in a Strong
Light.
CALIFORNIA INJURED.
Where Local Industries Suffer
From Bryanism, Foreign
Factories Thrive.
PROTECTION THE ONLY HOPE
Strangling Effect of the Wilson Bill
Upon Home Trade as Shown
by Statistics. .
As heretofore shown in a series of arti
cles on various phases of the tariff ques
tion, protection has always proved a great
blessing to the manifold industrial inter
ests of this country, while free trade has
been in the past, as it is now, a blessing to
the manufacturing nations of Europe.
It may be shown by recurring to the
commercial reports of tbe wool and other
interests of the country that ever since
the Wilson bill went into effect there has
been great activity among the factories of
Europe.
It comes directly home to Californians
to hear the opinion of one of their own
business men on the condition of affairs in
Europe. R. J. Techau, the well-known
proprietor of the Good Fellows' Grotto in
San Francisco, has just returned from a
four months' tour to Europe, and he says
there is no doubt that Europeans are more
greatly pleased with free trade than with
any possible phase of American politics ;
that they ignore the silver question as
having any possible bearing on their af
fairs, and hope for the continuation of a
Democratic tariff that will enable them to
manufacture for the American market.
Among other things Mr. Tecbau said:
The Europeans in general are running their
factories day and night, turning out articles
/or export, and as soon as McKinley's election
is announced they will be shipped in immense
quantities as rapidly as possible, in order to
get them in before a high tariff law goes into
effect.
1 spent a great deal of time in Copenhagen,
Carlsbad, Ostend. Nuremburg. Brussels, Dres
den, Berlin and Stockholm, and I found the
same conditions prevailing everywhere. In
Germany and Belgium particularly, where I
traveled a great deal, I saw miles of factories
running all night by electric lights* and to
their full capacity. I inquired in every place
as to the cause of the unusual activity, and
was told that it was due wholly to the prospect
of a high tariff in America.
Mr. Techau learned that the Wilson
tariff, while it has destroyed wages in this
country, has helped the condition of the
workers of Europe by making a great de
mand for the multitudinous articles ex
ported thither. Another striking sign
was that American importers were numer
ous. The bare possibility of a Democratic
victory, however remote, pleases them,
but the chances of McKinley's success
have stimulated business in Europe as it
has not been stimulated for years. Mr.
Techau continued as follows:
On an English railway train I found myself
in a compartment with live other persons,' and
four of them were the agents of American im
porters on their way to Germany to buy goods
for this year, and next as well, in anticipation
of tariff legislation by the next Congress. All
classes in Europe, from the laborer to the man
ufacturer, are discussing the tariff question,
and all fear the results of a McKinley victory.
The financial question ia barely mentioned
there, and when questioned concerning the
effect of free coinage Europeans simply shrug
thuir shoulders and say: "That will hurt
America alone, but a high tariff will hurt
us." The condition of the laboring classes
throughout Northern Enrope is first-class, by
reason of the demand for goods for export to
America.
How does the present poor condition of
labor in the United States compare with
its condition under the McKinley law?
The best authority is Joseph Nimmo Jr.,
Commissioner Carroll D. Wright, and
like statisticians. At the end of the first
year under the McKinley bill Mr. Nimmo
was able to say without fear of contradic
tion that there had been renewed pros
perity. Among other things he said :
The people of the State of New York have
been deeply interested by the recently pub
lished aunual report of the Commissioner of
Labor. That officer shows that the net value
of the increase in the production of the whole
sale manufactures ef the State. since the pas
sage of the McKinley Act has been $31,315,
-130; that the increased wages paid to labor in
those industries has amounted to $0,377,925,
and that the increase in annual wages during
the last year has amounted to $23 11 per
capita of persons employed. The Superin
tendent of Banking of the State of New York
also reports simultaneously an Increase of
over $85,000,000 in the deposits of the sav
ings banks of the State, chiefly the deposits of
laboring people. These important statements
fully confirm all that has been hereinbefore
stated us to the benefits conferred by the Mc-
Kinley Act.
But even these statements are of small mo
ment in comparison with the transcendently
important fact thatduring the last thirty years
of protection, agriculture in New York has en
tered upon a new life; that in all parts of the
State an almost innumerable number of man
ufacturing industries of every conceivable de
scription have sprung up, the value of the an
nual product of which amounts to hundreds
of millions of dollars, and that these indus
tries afford employment to hundreds of thou
sands of men, women, boys and girls, at tbe
same time supplying the invaluable adven
tages of reliable and persistent markets for a
large share of the agricultural products of the
State. Besides, agriculture and manufactures
have become related and correlated in ten
thousand different ways, the two branches of
industry in many instances beine lnteidepen
dent parts of a single establishment. All this
has resulted in a commerce which has greatly
stimulated and increased the trade and
financial interests of New York city, and of
every other city in the State. It has also pro
moted the welfare of every class of laborers in
the State, ana of persons employed in clerical
and professional occupations.
One of the undeniable results of protection
under the McKinley act is that new industries
are constantly springing up In this country
and being transplanted to this country from
Europe. Hardly a week passes without public
intelligence of such change of location by some
important English, French or Germany "indus
try. The State of New York is securing her full
snare of these acquisitions. But wuat could
be more natural or proper than that manu
facturers should seek a location in the country
In which they find their chief market ?
What has Bryanism to offer to compare
with such a showing as this? The free
traders are helpless in the presence of
facts, and whether it be the opinion of a
careful statistician or that of a traveler
from afar the conclusion is alike strong
that free trade and ruin are as much
synonyni3 as protection and prosperity.
SPANISH-AMERICAN CLUB.
An Intelligent Audience Listens to
Eloquent Addresses on Cam
paign Issues.
Every seat in California Hall on Bush
street was occupied last night by the
members of the Spanish- American Re
publican Club.
The principal speaker of the evening
was ex-Governor Romualdo Pacbeco, who
proceeded to enlighten his countrymen on
the issues of the campaign. He said:
"The fundamental sentiment of tbe Re
pubiican party is love for our country â
our whole country. We are for tbe Union,
one and unclivisible, now and forever.
"Our country is confronted by a peril,
not between the North and South, but of a
political nature and one of the gravest in
its history since 1860. It is an attempt by
the Democratic parcy to paralyze industry
by using all the power of the Government
to take property from the hands of those
who created it and place it in the hands of
those who covet it.
"The propositions submitted to the
American people by the convention are
outrageous. The success of the ticket
headed by Mr. Bryan would be an irrepara
ble calamity, not only to our country but
to civilized society everywhere."
R. R. Duckworth, Sylvester Sbaben and
James Kidney made short speeches, after
which the meeting was entertained with
music by Professor Luciano Mojica and
an orchestra of mandolins and guitars and
a piccolo solo by Marciano Nava.
MISS ANTHONY GLAD.
The Veteran Suffragist Says She
W s Charmed and Dellarhted
With the Mass-Meeting.
"I consider last Saturday night's meet
ing in the Auditorium one of the grand
est affairs of tne sort that I ever saw, and
I have seen many."
Miss Susan B. Anthony was seated amid
a group of ardent woman-suffrage work
ers, all, like their veteran leader, delight
ed with the enthusiastic formal indorse
ment which the suffrage plank in tbe
Republican platform had received at the
great mass-meeting.
"It was a clean, dignified meeting,"
went on Miss Anthony. "There was
nothing about it that savored of person
ality, nor a single coarse allusion of any
sort. Now, I Know a little abejut political
meetings, since I have been going to them
for half a century or so, and for propriety,
moderation and good taste this one seems
the peer of any that I have attended and
by far the superior of most.
"Of course, my main interest in the
gathering was to see how tlie woman-suf- j
frage plank would be handled. So much
seemed to depend upon the party's hearty â 
sponsorship of the measure that I was on i
the anxious seat all the time until I saw
how things were going. Little by little
the subject was reached. One or two
kindly, respectful references to it were
made by those grand speakers, and then
Mr. Scott spoke so feelingly and so truly
of woman's proper sphere in the social
fabric that I felt like cheering him at the
top of my voice. However, the crowd
saved my lungs that exertion.
"And then came Mr. Shortridge's clear, I
well-defined, flat-footed statement of his
party's position, given with all due pre
cision, as so formal a statement of a great
issue should be given, yet with an enthusi
astic friendliness so evidently real and so
contagious that the whole audience seemed
to be of one mind with him. I could not
cheer, I could not applaud. All I could do
was to restrain the tears of joy which
seemed determined to force their way from
eyes which had never gazed upon a grander
scene. The loud plaudits of that vast as
sembly, cheering the cause to which I
have devoted my life, seem still to be ring
ing in my ears, making me feel younger
and happier than ever belore in my public
life. To me it is no small matter that this I
great State seems to be about declaring
for the right.
"As to Mr. Knight's introduction of Miss |
Shaw, it was, in my opinion, the acme of |
surpassing refinement. He displayed the
delicacy of a gentleman presenting a lady,
and at the same time there was in nis
words and manner every indication of
that comradeship with which the truly
high-minded man treats his equal. Mr.
Bnortridge had sounded the keynote of
the campaign in clarion tones. Mr.
Knight seemed to take up the strain as
one instrument responds to another in a
grand orchestra. It was a fitting intro- I
duction to Miss Shaw, and she was plainly !
enthused by it. And then the cheers that
greeted her, and thÂ« bursts of applause
that compelled her to interrupt her ad
dress at lrequent intervals â the whole
thing was simply glorious.
"I must, however, exercise an old
woman's privilege and find fault with one
thing â there were too many women there.
Bonnets filled the house and crowded
upon the stage, while thousands of men â
votersâ were turned away. I felt like get
ting up and telling the women to go home
and stay there until after the campaign is
over. What business have the bonnets at
a political meeting while their owners can
not vote and merely deprive voters of the
seats to which they have a right? Next
year party leaders will welcome bonnets
as gladly as the now welcome bald heads,
but until then no woman should go to a
political meeting and usurp a voter's seat.
"However, bonnets and all things else
to the contrary notwithstanding, the
memory of that great meeting will be one
of my brightest recollections in tbe time
when I shall be able to work no longer.
I doubt if the innate nobility and chivalry
of Californian manhood ever shone forth
with brighter luster."
A Noted Fenian.
Captain Thomas Desmond is a candi
date for the Republican nomination for
Superintendent of Streets. Captain Des
mond in 1876 chartered the whaling vessel
Catalpa from New Bedford, and, with a
number of picked men, rescued six Fe
nian prisoners from Fremantle, Austra
lia, and landed them safely in New York.
These men had been sentenced to death
for treason by the British Government
and their sentences had been commuted
to imprisonment for life.
TELEPHONE LITIGATION
Tbe Western Electric Company of Chi
cago Seeks Protection in the
Courts.
It is reported that the Western Electric
Company of Chicago, constituting the
manufacturing branch of the American
Bell Telephone Company, has insti
tuted suits against the Standard Tele
phone Company in tbe United States
Circuit Court for the western district of
Wisconsin, on the infringement of the fol
lowing patents:
256.258, 309,617, 303,714, 299,926, 27,522.
28,266.
These patents are said to cover tele
phone connections, bell apparatus, switch
board appliances and general office mech
anism, upon all of which the American
Bell Telephone Company holds unexpired
patents.
Tbe apparatus of the Standard Tele
phone Company is used at Marquette,
Mich.; Jacksonville, Fla. ; Madison, Wis.;
Portland, Or., and San Jose, Cal., all of
which companies are vitally interested.
These suits are independent of the Ber
liner case, covering the basis patent of the
transmitter, now pending in the United
States Supreme Court.
Hailed the Chief.
The Rincon Hill Outing Club climbed to
the top of Mount Tamalpais last Saturday
night and on Sunday morning, as the sun
climbed lazily over the Berkeley hills,
they ran a banner to the top of the flag
staff on the eastern peak and the sun
gilded its folds as It floated out on the
breeze. There was upon it a picture of
McKinley, the Republican candidate for
President, and as the crowd on top of the
mountain saw it they burst into a cheer
that started the birds from the tiees in the
canyons far below. There were nearly 200
people waiting to see the sun rise and
they divided their attention between the
rising orb of day and the picture of the
leader upon which its rays glinted. There
was not a Bryan man in the crowd.
The Plumed Knights.
The Plumed Knights' Drill Corps, organ
ized twelve years ago, undertime leadership
of Captain John E. Klein, and at that time

members of Companies C and G, First
Regiment, N. G. C, the "Nationals." Tne

lieutenant, J. A. Christie; second lieuten
ant, Elmer E. Parmalee. Drills will be
held on Wednesday and Friday evenings
at 815 Ellis street, National Guard Hall, at

The Labor Unions.
At the meeting of the Sandstone-cutters
Union last evening the report was made of a
rumor that stone-cutters on the new ferry
depot would be required to work over eight
hours as soon as tne stone work begins. A
committee consisting of George Wright, Theo
dore Button and Daniel Howard was appointed
to interview the Labor Commissioner to-day
and ascertain how long it will be before the
stone work begins and how many hours the
men will have to labor.
At a meeting of the Golden Gate Lodge of
Plasterers last evening the entertainment
committee reported that nearly every prepara
tion has been made for the ball that will be
held on the evening of Saturday, September
26, in B'nai B'rith Hall.

evening decided to accept the invitation of
the San Francisco Labor' Council to partici
pate with that body in the Labor day cele
bration.
