BRYAN - DODGING
THE POPULISTS,
Notification of the St. Louis
Nomination Not
Desired.
ANGERED CONSTITUENTS
Bateman of Maine Says if He
Don't Accept Somebody
Else Will.
SEWALL IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
People's Party Men Insist That the
Nebraska Orator at Once Say
"Yes" or "No."
LJSWISTON, Mx., Aue. 23.â "Mr. Bryan
will be notified of his nomination by the
Populists." So said L. C. Bateman, Popu
list candidate for Governor of Maine, and
secretary of the notification committee of
the St. Louis Populist convention. Con
tinuing, ne declared: "This conspiracy to
dodge the Populist nomination will not
work. We refuse to be used as a door mat
for Mr. Bryan to walk on ; we will notify
him of his nomination witn Watson, and
he will have to answer. If he doesn't
accept, we have the power to pull him
down and fill the vacancy. He sent his
mrikers to St. Louis, Senator Jones and
others, and fairly begged us for the
nomination. Now he thinks he can injure
us. We will show him whether he can
or not.
"Senator Allen of Nebraska," said he,
"has been playing into the hands of the
Democrats in this notification matter, but
he is only one out of foity-four members
of the committee. Apropos of Sewall, we
beg to remind our Democratic friends
that cutting off the ears of a jackass and
ginning a few feathers on his tail doesn't
make him a canary bird.
"Again, if William J. Bryan is going to
stand for a bank president and trust mana
ger, as against Tom Watson, he will wake
up after the November election with his
crown of thorns still on his head."
MeKIXjLEY'S MAUD WORK.
Has Made Fifty Campaign Speeches and
If ill 3lafee> as Many More.
CANTON. Ohio, Aug. 28.â After a week
, of uncommonly hard work Major McKin
ley enjoyed a day of absolute rest. . The
weather was inclemen in the morning
and he remained &i home. In the after
noon he tooK Mrs. McKinley out for a
drive.
Charles G. Dawes, a member of the Na
tional Executive Committee, and Major
Charles S. Dick, who is also an importan t
factor in the Western headquarters, came
to Canton to-day to consult with Major
McKinley. They had a long talk over the
situation in the West, whicn seems to
present many more difficulties than that
in the Eastern States.
Major McKinley expects to be very busy
this coming week. He will make two
speeches on Monday, one to a delegation
of farmers from Knox County, Ohio, and
the other to a number of potters aud
other citizens of East Liverpool.
There have been a great many farmers
in several of tne delegations which have
come to Canton, but there has been no
delegation composed exclusively of farm
ers, and the one coming to-morrow will be
the first of that description. The farmers
have not come in large delegations, for
the reason that they have been very busy
since the nomination of McKinley with
their harvests. During the months of Sep
tember and October a large number of
agriculturists will call. Upward of a
thousand are coming on excursions and a
good many letters have been received here
from farming communities indicating
that the desire to see Major McKinley is
steadily growing.
The demand for Republican political
literature is widespread, insistent and
earnest. Not only are all committee
headquarters burdened with requests for
documents, but Major McKinley's mail
contains daily a score of letters of similar
purport. These letters are referred to
the State or National Committees and the
writers would save time by so addressing
them in the first place.
Between the first of this week and the
third day of November Major McKinley
expects to make a great many speeches,
probably not fewer than fifty. He has al
ready made half a hundred since his
nomination and they have been collected
and printed in a neat pamphlet, which is
ready for distribution here to-morrow.
There will be another edition of his
speeches about October L
The demand for them is so great, not
withstanding the fact tuat they are all
published in the newspapers, that it has
been found necessary to print them in
book form. Major McKinley still insists
that be will take no holiday during the cam
paign, but he has promised to go to Zoar,
about eighteen miles from Canton, where
he hopes to remain two or three days.
He will also make a few very brief visits
to Cleveland during the campaign. All
the rest of the time he will spend in
Canton.
SEIAN AND HILL, TO MEET.
Arrangement* for the Senator and the
Sebmskan to Launch Together.
TARRYTOWN, N. V., Aug. 23.âAc
cording to present arrangements William
J. Bryan will lunch with Senator David B.
Hill in Albany on Tuesday afternoon. Mr.
Bryan will not say so, but the statement
is nevertheless true.
When a representative of the United
Associated Presses asked the Democratic
candidate about the matter this evening
Mr. Bryan would not give any informa
tion on the subject.
There was a rumor at Upper Red Hook
the day Mr. Bryan accepted the invitation
to be the gaest of Chairman Hinkley of
the State Democratic Committee, at Win
nisook Lodge in the Catskills, that Sena
tor Hill would meet him in the quiet of
that mountain camp, where they would be j
The San Francisco Call.
free from interruption and from the like
lihood of having too much public atten
tion drawn to their conference. Mr. Bryan
and Senator Hill have undoubtedly
reached an understanding, through those
who conducted the negotiations for their
consultation, as to the ground on which
each shall stand when they come together.
With such a foundation to start from they
can perfect any mutual agreement in much
shorter time than they could if there had
been no prearrangement.
When Mr. Bryan leaves Winnisook
Lodge Tuesday afternoon he will be more
familiar with what the Democratic State
organization proposes with regard to his
candidacy. Chairman Hinkley will in ail
likelihood make him better acquainted
with the position Senator Hill intends to
assume. Mr. Hill and Major Hinkley
stand very close to each other in political
matters, and the beliei has been that the
State chairman has been authorized to
speak with some degree of authority for
the Senator. That visit to Winnisook
Lodge will extend from tomorrow evening
until the next afternoon.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan will say goodby to
Upper Red Hook at noon to-morrow and
proceed to Rhinecliffe by carriage. A tug
will be at Rhinecliffe at 2 o'clock to carry
them across the Hudson at Rondout,
where they are to take a train for Big In
dian, from which place they will drive to
WinnisooK Lodge. Tuesday they will
leave Winnisook Lodge in time to catch
th '. New York Central train arriving in
Albany at 4:05 p. m., and will start for
Syracuse at 7:55.
Mr. Bryan attended services at the
Dutch Reformed Church in Upper Red
Hook this morning in company with Mr.
Perrine. There was no unusual crowd
present.
Rev. G. D. Lydecker, the gpastor of the
church, conducted the services, and in his
prayer thus referred to Mr. Bryan : "And
specially bless thy servant whom we have
in our midst, thy honored servant. Fili
him with wisdom and power for the anx
ieties and fatigues of the coming days and
fill him with hope and confidence in all
thy purposes concerning him and these
people." The sermon was preached by
Dr. Robert H. Barr of the Associated Re
formed Church ot Newburg. He made no
direct reference to the Democratic candi
date nor to the political situation.
After tne services both ministers came
down from the pulpit and shook hands
with Mr. Bryan, many of the congregation
following their example.
The position taken by President Lewis
Miller of the Chautauqua Assembly con
cerning the report that the Democratic
candidate would speak at Chautauqua
next Sunday, is indorsed by Mr.
Bryan. Several newspapers contain
a statement from President Miller
denying that Mr. Bryan would
speak there, unless an arrangement could
be made to have Major McKinley appear,
and when this was shown Mr. Bryan he
said:
"I shall not speak there. Being inter
ested in Chautauqua work my wife and I
will avail ourselves of thÂ« opportunity to
see the parent association. The work of
the association is non-partisan and the
president is quite right in saying that
neither candidate should speak there un
less both are invited."
A number of people called at the Per
rine residence to-day to see Mr. Bryan.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan presented them with
buttons bearing the picture of the candi
date.
SOUND-MONEY DEMOCRATS.
Prospect* of a Large Attendance at the
Indianapolis Convention.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Aug. 23.â Sound
Money Democrats from throughout the
country who drop into the headquarters
of the National Democracy here to look
over the ground and size up the prospects
for the convention declare that the move
ment is gathering strength beyond their
expectations, and is developing a force
they little hoped for when they launched
it.
It is generally understood among the
members of the National Committee that
the New York delegation shall be permitted
to name the temporary chairman of the
convention, and it is the supposition that
it will select Bourke Cockran, though this
can hardly be determined until the dele
gation arrives on the ground the next day
after the members are elected. For per
manent chairman there has been
much talk of Senator Vilas of
Wisconsin, but during the last
few days Vilas has loomed up in large
proportions as a possibility for the Presi
denial nomination, and if this seems
probable when the convention meets the
permanent chairman will probably be
taken from the South. There is much
talk of Senator Caffery of Louisiana and
ex-Governor Jones of Alabama for the
position.
The correspondence of the executive
committee indicating a larpe attendance
upon the convention is borne out by the
hotel engagements that have been pouring
in since Friday night. Among tbe prom
inent Democrats from various States who
have engaged quarters for the convention
are: Ex-Governor Roswell P. Flower,
John R. Fellows of New York. Senator
Vilas and General E S. Bragg of Wiscon
sin, Governor Walter, Joel A. Sperry and
David A. Wells of Connecticut, W. P. C.
Breckinridge and W. H. Haideman of
Kentucky, J. E. Outhwaite of Ohio, Gen
eral Palmer, Controller Eckels and John
P. Hopkins of Illinois, ex-Secretary Fair
child of New York, Senator Caffery of
Louisiana. ex-Governor Jones of Alabama,
Governor Why te and Congressman Kayner
of Maryland, Secretary Morton of Ne
braska and Senator Gray of Delaware.
LETTERS OF ACCEPTANCE.
McKinley and Hobart Will Declare
Themnelves Ttiltt Meek.
â  NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 23.-The Sun
to-morrow will say: It is stated on the
best authority that the letter of the Hon.
William McKinley, accepting the nomina
tion of the Republican party for the Pres
idency, will be made public this week.
The candidate will break the record In
sending in hiÂ« letter thus early, as it has
been usually well into September before
the candidates for the Presidency have
published their formal acceptance. Mr.
Hanna and the other campaign managers,
nowever, have recognized this as an ex-"
ceptional year.
The campaign is further advanced than
it has ever been before in a Presidential
year since the organization of the Repub
lican party, and it was concluded that it
would be well that the candidates should
get out their letters and declare them
selves in unmistakable terms on the
chief issues as >-oon as possible. Vice-
Presidential Candidate Hobart has only
been awaiting tl.e action of the head of the
ticket, and his letter will be maae public
immediately following that of Major Mc-
Kinley.
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, AUGUST 24, 1896.
William Jennings Bryan declines to discuss the issues of the campaign with any one other than
Mr. McKinley.â Press Dispatch.
TERESA'S FANATICS
FALL IN BATTLE,
Three Revolutionists Slain
by Mexican Troops in
Chihuahua.
PEaUAS CANON CONFLICT
Soldiers Defeat the Raiders
With the Loss of but
One Mao.
ASCENSION RODRIGUEZ SHOT.
A Leader in the Uprising Executed
at Oj naga â Desperados Join
the Revolt.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 23.â A Re
corder special from San Antonio, Texas,
says: Another battle has occurred be
tween the large band of Mexican outlaw
fanatics and a force of Mexican soldiers,
who attacked the revolutionists in the
Pequas Canyon, Chihuahua, Mexico, just
across the Rio Grande from Presidio
County, Texas. Three bandits and one
soldier were killed. The bandits were pat
to flight.
Ascension Rodriguez, one of the bandit
leaders, who was captured a few days ago,
has been shot at Ojinaga. A large num
ber of desperate characters have disap
peared from Texas border counties, and
are believed to have joined the outlaw
band, which now numbers over 500,
The Dandits pretend to be revolution
ists, and allege that their operations are
directed against the Mexican Government.
They claim to belong to the same army as
the band of fanatics which recently at
tacked Nogales, Sonora.
Santa Teresa Urrea, the wonderful
leader of the fanatics, reached Valentine,
Tex., yesterday. She is on her way from
Nogales to join the band of men operating
across the river from the Texas border. A
force of Texas rangers has gone to Pre
sidio, Tex., and will prevent trouble on
this side of the Rio Grande.
Nearly 1000 Mexican troops are on their
way from Chihuahua and other points in
that State to the scene of the trouble.
Sheriff Dan Knight of Presidio County is
tnere and the latestadvices from him say:
"I have crossed tne river from Ojinaga.
The officers have just received word that
they will be attacked this evening. Fifty
armed men left Ojina-a to meet the
fanatics, twenty miles from here. There
are fifty or sixty of them, but the officers
at Ojinaga think there are more hiding in
the mountains. Two days ago the soldiers
made a raid on the fanatics and they
"os-ed to this side.
'â¢Things look gloomy here and the
officers ask for protection from this side,
as the bandits will cross to this side when
they are overpowered. I think Captain
Hughes should come at once, with all the
help he can bring. I have telegraphed
him to do so.
'â¢We expect every moment to hear of a
right on tne other side. People at Ojinaga
are excited, as they think the town will
probably be destroyed when the outlaws
cross to this side, so they can't get at
them. The telegraph wires were cut again
\
yesterday. If possible, we ought to have
a company of soldiers."
RUNAWAY TROLLEY-CAR.
Jumps a Curve on a Steep Grade â No
One Killed Outright, but litany
A~e Badly Injured.
NEW YORK. N. V., Aag. 33.â A special
to the Herald from Frederics, Md., says:
A runaway trolley-car carrying more than
100 passengers dp.shed down the Catoctin
Mountains this evening, and in rounding
a curve upset aud was smashed into
kindling wood. Although going at the
rate of sixty miles an hour at the time of
the accident, no one was killed outright,
but forty were injured, some of them
seriously.
The line had just been started and ex
tended from Frederick City to Catoctin
Heights, a distance of five miles. It was
soon after dark this evening when car 101
started down the mountain for home. It
accommodated only sixty passengers, but
the crowd fought to get on in spite of the
conductor's protests.
After traveling at a high rate of speed
about a mile, Motorman Mutz tried to
stop, but found that while the brake
worked on the front wheels, he could not
control tnose in the rear. The passengers
became panic-striken, and the car shot on
until about two and a half miles down the
mountain, when it jumped a curve.
Thomas Anderson, a native of Frederick,
was injured internally and w*i!l die. Miss
Annie Buckles, aged 40 years, is badly
bruised and suffering from the shock.
Others had arms and legs broken. Relief
was sent from Frederick.
PREACHER AND REPORTER FIGHT
Disgraceful Seen' in- a Georgia Howe of
JTovhlp.
MACON, Ga., Aug. 23.â A sensation was
caused in the leading Methodist church of
this city to-night by a difficulty between
Rev. Alonzo Monk, pastor of the church,
and Tilden Adamson, a reporter of the
Daily Telegraph. Adamson reported the
reverend gentleman's sermon last Sunday,
which was pronounced by the pastor to be
incorrect.
At to-night's service the Rev. Monk was
particularly severe on the reporter and
reflected on him in such a manner as to
cause Adamson to resent it at the end of
the sermon. Going to the pulpit the
young man demanded an explanation of
of the doctor's remarks. An exchange of
.words angered both gentlemen, whereupon
they grappled each other.
Deacons of the church rushed forward
and an exciting exchange of blows be
tween them and the reporter followed.
The newspaper man stood firm and de
fended himself as best he could against
odds. Police were sent for. The con
gregation was greatly excited, more than
1000 people being present. Women and
men stood on tiptoe to watch the outcome
of the scuffle. Finally order was restored,
but the services were shortened by the
scene.
The trouble to-night was the outcome of
his sermons on the barrooms of jviacon.
SE RIO US STRIKE SITUATION.
Tin plate factory Operatives Propose to
Use the Boycott.
ELWOOD, Ind., Auk. 23.â The strike
situation at the tinplate factory is serious.
When asKed what they would do when
tho men were brought here on Monday to
take their places, one of tne leading
strikers said :
â¦'We will let them go to work if they
want to. We will not try to prevent them
by force."
Their plan, it is learned, is to boycott
every business man in the city who owns
stock or is interested in the company in
anyway. The tin plate company is* ar
rangine to start on Monday, and it is
lojirned that to-morrow morning a special
train will arrive here from Pittsburg,
bringing non-union men to take the strik
ers' places, and they will be taken into the
factory and put to work regardless of any
interference on the part of the strikers, if
any is made.
UNION RAILROAD
MEN ATTACK DEBS
Insinuations Against the
Brotherhoods Are Re
plied To.
CHIEF ARTHUR'S RETORT
Charges of Treachery on the
Part of the Engineers
Denied.
TART TALK AT TERRE HAUTE.
Members of the Various Orders Ad.
vised to Do as They Please
Politically.
TERRE HAUTE, Ind., Aug. 23.â The
union meeting of the railroad brother
hoods to-day was made sensational by
reason of the fact that the local trades
unions declined the invitation to attend,
and did so in such terms as caused Chief
Arthur of the engineers and Grand Master
Sargent of the firemen to. make bitter re
plies to the assaults on the old brother
hoods. It was known that Eugene V.
Debs, president of the American Railway
Union, is the admired labor leader here at
his home, and what Arthur and Sargent,
especially the former, said to-day is ac
cepted as replies to the statement often
made by Debs, that the old class organiza
tions had passed the day of their useful
ness.
There were four or five hundred railroad'
men present, many accompanied by
women members of their families. The
Terre Haute trade union men were not
represented by as many as a dozen. Sar
gent showed his feeling in the intense way
in which he defended his organization
from the implication that it had not been
fraternal in its relations with trade un
ions; that it is an aristocratic labor organ
ization. The Central Labor Union had
said in the resolution that the brother
hoods had held aloof from tne labor or
ganizations and that Chief Arthur had
said the engineers' organization is not a
labor union. Sartent said the Firemen's
Brotherhood takes no exception to the
vie ws of others in regard to labor, but it
will not permit to go unchallenged the as
sertion that it is dying and in disgrace.
It remaius in Terre Haute, by its lodge,
composed of good citizens, and it is going
to remain here. Referring to the political
issues of the year, he said the men should
discuss the issues among themselves,
without regard to party. They must not
wait until some one in authority over them
told them how to vote. In the lodgeroom
they shoulo strip themselves of the in
fluence of party or clique or corporation.
When they do this the day of salvation
for the wage-earner will be here.
Chief Arthur followed Sargent, begin
ning with the assertion that he was there
to defend the engineers. He had seen the
statement that he had said the brother
hood is not a labor organization, and he
wanted to brand it as a wicked falsehood.
He has always said it was a labor organ
ization, composed of men representing a
branch of labor he considered to be skilled
labor. It is true it is confined to one class
of labor. If all classes of labor were thor
oughly organized in their, respective â¢
classes there would be no difficulty in each
securing its demands. Tf all firemen were
in the organization and there should be
occasion for all the firemen on one road to
quit work, the company would be unable
to get men to take their places.
"To show that P. M. Arthur is not what
he has been represented to be," said he.
"I want to say that I commenced as a
wiper and was promoted to be a fireman
and then an engineer. I always knew my
place. I would advise men to shun sa
loons and gambling dens. If that is
preaching aristocracy I am an aristocrat.
If I had my way I would close all the sa
loons and there would be no occasion for
a Keeley Institute. The workingmen are
their own worst enemies, but the Brother
hood is making better men of the men in
the train service. It is said that the En
gineers' Brotherhood has failed to give
protection to its members. Wherever it
has so failed it has been because of the
perfidy aud treachery of the members
themselves on the road where the griev
ance existed."
He challenged any one to truthfully
contradict this stoteraent.
This was in reference to the statement
by Eugene V. Debs recently, that thirty
engineers had been discharged from tbe
Plant system as part of the policy of the
managers of that system to drive organ
ized labor off' the road, and that no at
tempt was made by Arthur to protect
them. Chief Arthur said that the broth
erhood had paid $6,000,000 insurance. To
day it has 107 written contracts with rail
road companies as to wages. In one year
it expelled 370 members for drunkenness
and it was steadily raising the moral
standard of engineers.
Chief Clark of the conductors also spoke,
but in a general way.
Grand Master Morrissey of the train
men, in the course of his remarks said the
politicians were filled with promises or
dire predictions, but the only way in
which tbe wage standard can be main
tained is through organized labor. The
political parties will not do it.
Secretary Austin of the Order of Teleg
raphers also spoke.
UNIVERSAL SEAMEN'S STRIKE.
A Demand for Better Wages and Conditions
That Will Extend Throughout the
World.
NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 2aâ lt is re
ported here that preparations are being
made for a longshoremen's and seamen's
strike all over the world.
Andrew Furuseth of San Francisco, sec
retary of the Pacific Coast Seamen's
Union; E. T. Eiderkin, secretary of the
National Seamen's Union, and H. E. Bar
ter, secretary of the International Long
shoremen's Union, have been correspond
ing with seamen of different countries
about arranging for a universal strike.
They believe that a strike of seamen and
longshoremen to be successful should be
universal. The leaders here have been
corresponding with seamen's unions in
England, France, Austria. Germany, Italy
and Portugal.
One of the leaders of the Atlantic Coast
Seamen's Union said yesterday that the
big dock strikes in England were only a
prelude to bigger strikes, and the time was
nearly ripe for a strike of seamen and
longshoremen everywhere.
Conferences were being held in Great
Britain and other shipping centers, and
there was a general feeling that a great
struggle was near.
The demands are for better wages and
conditions, and for guarantees that sea
men will be protected against the tyranny
of unjust captains and shipping masters.

She Raves in Despair When
Restoratives Check Her
Celestial Flight.
SOON RELAPSES INTO STUPOR.
Peculiar Condition of a Woman Who,
by S ight Chance, Escaped
Burial Alive.
PORTLAND, On., Aug. 23â Mrs. Mary
S. Albertson, wfio by the slightest chance
escaped being inhumed alive in tuis city
several weeks ago, is again undergoing a
living death, attended by circumstances
so remarkable that physicians and scien
tists are completely nonplused. Mrs.
Albertson was believed to have died of
typhoid fever on the morning of July 27,
and two days later preparations were made
for her interment. Frank Tnurman, an
old hospital nurse and a friend of the
woman, believing that he detected some
spark of life in the remains, almost got
into several personal altercations because
of his refusal to permit the burial until
more certain evidences of death had mani
fested themselves. The old nurse's pre
mises were correct, for with the aid of a
galvanic battery and other restoratives
the seemingly dead woman was brought
to life on the morning of August 4. Dur
ing all the time that she was laid out for
burial she was cognizant of what was pass
ing about her, yet unable to articulate a
sound or move a muscle.
Mrs. Albertson had sufficiently recov
ered on August 10 to visit friends near
Grants Pass, and on the evening of her
departure from Portland she seemed in
excellent health. But now she is once
more in a cataleptic state.
Tnurman to-day received a letter from
B. S. Biochxneier, whose family Mrs. Al
bertson is visiting, announcing that she
became very iil two days after her arrival
there and on the third day she was dead,
to all appearances. But for her narrow
escape from being buried alive here, she
would have suffered the most horrible
fate conceivable by the human mind.
The galvanic battery was again applied,
but it proved useless until noon on Tues
day. Then the cataleptic trance gradually
released its hold on tbe patient and at 4
o'clock she asked for a drink of water.
She, however, failed to realize where she
was and complained bitterly at being re
moved from the society of her parents
(both dead), with whom she was having a
delightful visit.
In this instance she had been abso
lutely unconscious of passing events and,
as the theosophists have it, her astral
body had been wandering about in celes
tial realms. It was almost impossible to
convince her that she had for several days
been in a death-like trance.
For several hours she raved like one
demented for having been brought back
to earth. At 9 o'clock that night she
grew more lucid and able to grasp her
phenomenal condition. When bright
enough to realize her second frightful
escape she went into convulsions and at
midnight was again in a trance. The
letter adds that since then, up to Friday
evening, Mrs. Albertson's reason has but
once been restored by means of the gal
vanic battery.
A remarkable feature in connection with
this case is that while in the trance Mrs.
Albertson's respiration and pulsations are
absolutely imperceptible. Her medical
attendant says her life hangs on a frail
thread and death is likely to ensue at any
moment.

formly enthusiastic on him and on his
performance. His merciless arraignment
of the London Times is still fresh in men's
memories as the loftiest forensic product
of our day, yet the Times leads in the
chorus of admiring approval of his Sara
toga speech.
Lord Russell was not afraid to talk frank
Republicanism to an American audience,
just as here he has always been an out
spoken Radical, but the Tory papers
praise his address quite as warmly as tbe
rest. Tbe truth is that he has already at
tained, without their knowing it, a very
powerful hold upon the respect and the
imagination of tbe English people, and it
needed only that huge outburst of cheer
ing at Saratoga to wake them up to the
fact that when he returns he will find him
self publicly set on a pinnacle to which
none of bis predecessors ever climbed.
The facts that Lord Russell is an Irish
man and that from the beginning he has
been a devoted Nationalist have playvd a
bigger part in the shaping of public
opinion here in the past year or two than
any one imagines. The effect of his grow
in sr prestige on the bench has been insen
sibly to modify English prejudices about
Irishmen and Home Rulers in general. In
proportion as he rose above others as the
typical great judicial figure in England, it
became more difficult to despise as bar
barians or to hate as traitors his country
men, with whom he was in such full sym
pathy. I believe it i 3 to this subtle in
fluence on men's minds that the Tory land
bill for Ireland and the Tory release of the
dynamite convicts are largely due. These
things could not have been attained if the
rank and file of the party, and society be
hind it, had not undergone a sensible
softening toward Ireland.
Lord Russell's objections to a permanent
arbitration tribunal are recognized here as
important and striking, but the press
rather shrinks from expressing an opinion
on their merits. There is a disposition
instead to leave that matter to the author
ities on both siaes for settlement between
themselves and tbis is clone with a lighter
heart since faith in a friendly and satis
factory understanding among these
authorities is now universal.
The ifiastern question has passed for the
time being into a relatively pacific phase.
The Turk has obtained his customary stay
of proceedings. This will enable him to
think up reasons for not doing wbat he
has been told to do, and the Cretans have
with some difficulty been persuaded to
keep quiet during the interval. There is
hope among the Continental Chancellors
that this artificial lull will be maintained,
at least till the Czar gets home again on
November 1, but it is doubtful if it c&n be
managed. The Cretans have been led to
believe that they are going to get au
tonomy at the very least, and meanwhile
they are steadily increasing their stores of
arms and supplies, obtained from Greek
smugglers.. When the disclosure is made
that the Turk refuses even to consider
autonomy for Crete they are very unlikely
to continue the truce. The possibilities
are that another fortnight will see the
island plung. din civil war again. Mean
wbiie no visible progress is made among
the powers toward a decision as to what
will be done next when Turkey declines
the suggestions now before her. It is not
even clear, indeed, wbat these suggestions
are, although it is suspected that England
is unofficially pressing for Cretan au
tonomy and getting more or less informal
support from Russia, France and Italy.
This drawing of Italy toward the
Franco-Russian combination is the most
interesting of the whole imbroglio.
It is years since a royal betrothal has
created such a political sensation as was
caused tbis week by the engagement of
the Prince of Naples to Helene of Mon
tenegro. The Prince is a fragile, sickly
little fellow. He is idolized by those
about him, but it has always been under
stood that he was doomed to celibacy.
His sudden betrothal to the magnificent
mountain-bred beauty whom the present
Czar was not allowed to wed is hence re
garded everywhere as a political coup. It
brings the Italian court at once into sym
pathetic relations with tbe Montenegrin
principality, which is a strictly Russian
outpost on tbe Adriatic, and gives Italy a
direct interest in Russia's game in the
Baikanv Naturally, Vienna and Berlin
are .btonnded and disgusted at tbis sud
den development and they take no pains
to conceal the fact.
Rumors about ths German Emperor's
ill temper continue to come, but they are
now accompanied by signs that tbe Ger
man public, too, is petting angry. The
dismissal of Bronsart Schellendorf from
tbe War Ministry is rather the worst
thing which the Emperor has yet been
persuaded to do by his "Kitchen Cabinet"
of favorites, tor the reason that it closely
touches the army, with which not even
Emperors can afford to trifle.
Discipline is so omnipotent in the army
that of course not a word has been heard
from it, but it is well understood that
Bronsart was sacrificed because he urged
reforms in the present medieval star
chamber systems of courts-martial, and
that all the progressive military leaders
are dismayed and exasperated by bis re
moval. The German press is speaking
witti great plainness about the affair, and
there promises to be, when the Reichstag
meets, an open debate on the whole sub
ject of the Emperor's unofficial ad
visers.
There are reports this evening that the
latest Franco-German frontier incident is
likely to develop unpleasantly. A group
of young French soldiers who seem to
have been intoxicated crossed the frontier
ana went half a mile into German terri
tory at Wurtzelstein. In the course of
their boisterous frolic they stripped off
the coat of a German soldier on furlough
and carried it back with them. Another
account says that the Frenchmen merely
found the coat in the house of a peasant
to whose absent brother it belonged, and
that they cut off the buttons and brought
it away. The German Foreign Office of
course complained, and now there is a
rumor that the answer of the French
Government was unsatisfactory. It is im
possible to verify the report.
Vienna is decorating on an extravagant
scale and in wild haste for the Czar's visit
next Thursday, and the special six horses
that have been assigned for the use of the
imperial visitors are drilled daily not to
shy at crowds, flags or brass bands. All
the grooms spend an hour daily bawling
"Uoch" into the ears of these horses, so
as to accustom them to cheering. Nearly
20,000 troops are to line the way from the
station to the palace. This is more
soldiers than Vienna has ever ?een thus
employed. Paris too is already repaying
the street in front of the Russian Embassy,
and will soon be in frantic throes of deco
ration on a scale never dreamed of before.
The fears lest violence may be attempted
have created a veritable panic in the Paris
ian official mind, and it is announced that
foreigners who are m France during the
period of the Czar's visit must have their
passports ready to show at any moment,
and must expect the most minute police
surveillance. These precautions far exceed
anything the late Czar ever thought
essential in foreign capitals, and make
one wonder whether personal terror is one
of the afflictions with which Nicholas II
is struggling.
Now that the upper Nile is at last in
condition to be traversed by steamers, a
lively dash ferward to Doneola by the
British is a matter of days. For the last
few weeks there has Deen a sharp censor
ship in the English camp over both
telegrams and mail letters, so the public
here is quite in the dark as to the amount
and character of the opposition which the
Sirdar expects. This, however, has dis
turbed no one, since it is taken for granted
that the dervishes are played out as a
serious fightine force. Such public inter
est in the Soudan affair as exists is ab
sorbed in the problem of what is to hap
pen after Dongola has been occupied and
the Caliph chased out of Oradurman, for
this is universally assumed to be included
in the plans of the campaign. When the
expedition was first announced last spring
these dispatches reflected Sir Charles
Dilke's position, that nothing iess than
the conquest of Darfur and Equatorial
Africa was its ultimate object. At that
time the ministry indignantly repudiated
the idea; but now we hear of a Congo
State force advancing forward to clear this
dark and little-known land, and if it hap
pens in the end that the whole Nile Val
ley and the road into Uganda are rid of
dervish control, and that somehow it has
all come to be British territory, no wise
man will be surprised.
The French at least firmly believe that
this is wbat ia intended, and it is likely
that the British or Belgian advance will
find French posts near the sources of the
Nils in unexpected places. This prospect
must be kept in mind as a possible occa
sion of trouble, but no one here regards it
with apprehension.
The French occupation of Timbuctoo,
whatever its material results, has proved
to be of remarkable service to the students
who are grappling with the archaeological
problems of Africa. Felix Dubois is now
publishing in L'lllustration as a serial the
results of his explorations there. His text
is plentifully illustrated by photographs,
and to judge from the first chapters it has
been a long time since such a strikingly
original and valuable book has appeared.
The architectural and ethnographic re
mains of early Egyptian colonies near
Timbuctoo are especially noteworthy.
The recent popular rage for books about
mountain climbing is said to show, from
the publisher's point of vie 1 ,?, sorr.3 signs
of abatement, but its effects on the public
will make this a miserable year in the
Alps. Already the fatalities among the
climbers for the season exceed the total
which used to be considered bad for a
space of ten years.
Until last year the Predigstuhl in the
Tyrol had been considered inaccessible.
Then it was climbed for the tirÃt time,
and this year there have been five ascents,
two of which resulted in fatal accidents,
and numerous adventurous persons are
now on the spot preparing for an attempt
to reach this pulpit, As for the Alps
proper lives are thrown away weekly on
all sorts of foolhardy ventures by people
who, having read Whymper and Conway,
decline to take the advice of guides or to
conform to any of the old rules governing
mountain work.
It is safe to predict that there will be an
unprecedented attendance to-morrow at
the little German Catholic Church in
White chapel, where the nephew of the
King of Saxoay is to make his first ap
pearance as a priest and to preach at high
mass. There are four lives between Prince
Max and the throne, so there was no dy
nastic objection to his following his voca
tion and taking orders, which he did some
months ago, but why he wanted to come
to England and do rough mission work in
the east end of London is not understood.
It appears that both his family and some
at least of the British priesthood discour
aged the idea, and the Leipsic and Dres
den press pointed out that Saxony was an
extremely good field for missionaries, but
the young man had bis own way.
It seems as if every week brought same
fresh note on the changes which the bi
cyie is making in popular tastes and
habits. A year ago fashionable London
was quite daft over the notion of skating
on artificial ice, and the rinks made such
huge profits that speculators formed a
company to build a great national skating
palace. Now this company has gone into
the bands of a receiver, and another enter
prise similar, though less ambitious, is
also on its last legs. The explanation is
the one that serves to account for every
thing nowadays â aamely, that everybody
is cycling.
Ten weeks hence the use of motor car
riages at tht rate of fourteen miles an hour
will be legal on English roads, and shrewd
men in the cycle business baiieve tuat this
new development in locomotion will be
even more remarkable than cycling in its
general effects on the country. The great
manufacturing firms of Leeds, Preston
and Bedford have already made big
preparations for ihe new industry, but ap
parently the bulk of it will be centered at
Coventry, the town which first bad the in
telligence to grasp the possibilities of the
bicycle trade, Habqlb Fsjedebic.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 1896.
INTRIGUE RIFE
IN FATHERLAND,
Rumors of Changes in the
German Ministry
Continue.
HOTBED OF DISCONTENT.
The Military Faction Is Getting
the Upper Hand in State
Affairs.
YON HOHENLOHE'3 POSITION.
Induced by the Kais r to Remain in
Office Until Alter the Visit
of the Czar.
[Copyr!gbt,lBB6,by the United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Gebmany, Aug. 23.â Before
the Reichstag reassembles in November
it is certain that then will be important
changes in the Cabinet, if indeed an entire
revision of the Ministry does not take
place. Despite the persistent semi-official
denials that Prince Hohenlohe, the Im
perial Chancellor, is on the eva of retire
ment from office, the Boersen Zaitong
bits the mars squarely in stating that the
Chancellor asked the Emperor for his dis
missal at the time of his recent visit to
the Kaiser at Wiihelmshohe, knowing
that the Hahnke-Lucanus cabal prevailed
against him, but the Emperor induced the
Prince to remain in office until after the
visit of the Czar and Czarina to Breslau.
The Freisinnige Zeitung (Radical) in
an article discussing the character of the
future Cabinet, asserts that during the
Emperor's recent trip to the Nordland
Count Bothe zu Eulenburg, master of
ceremonies at the imperial court of Ger
many, accompanied by his cousin, Count
Doenhoff, followed the Kaiser's route
throughout his Majesty's tour and kept
up constant communication with his
brother, Count Philip Eulenburg, German
Embassador to Austria, who accompanied
the Kaiser in the capacity of representa
tive of the Foreign Office.
The motive of the Freisinnige Zeitung
in making this statement is to depict the
Emperor as the central figure in the in
trigues for a change in the Chancellor
ship, and this opinion of the matter has
obtained the ready support of a iarge num
ber of persons in and out of official life in
view of all (hat is now transpiring in offi
cial circles.
The feature of the existing imbroglio is
that two parties exist within the Govern
ment which are fighting each other des
perately. First, there is Freiherr Mar
gchall yon Bieberstein, Minister of Foreign
Affairs, whose inspired organ, the Cologne
Gazette, declares that it is impossible to
consider the Kaiser's Military Cabinet as
identical with the Emperor himself; and
second, there is the practically governing
General yon Hahnke, chief of the Kaiser 1 s
Military Cabinet, who, through the me
dium of the ReicUsanzeiger, the official
gazette, says that the Military Cabinet
only exercises the Emperor's behests.
Freiherr Bieberstein himself seems
destined tn be elbowed out of the Cabinet,
and Dr. Lncanus, the chief of the Em
peror's Civil Cabinet, is mentioned as
having a very good chance of being pro
moted to a higher ofhee. Nobody con
nected with the semi-official press, nor
anj body connected with the Govern
ment, haa hitherto supposed that Dr.
Lncanus held the inside track, but that
personate is now credited with being
fully informed of everything that the
Kaiser intended to do.
Several newspapers which pretended to
be officially inspired were woefully dis
credited over the matter of the retire
ment of General Bronsart yon Bchellen
dorf from the Ministry of War. Instances
of this are shown in the fact that the Ber
lin Tageblatt and the Hanover Courier, at
the same hour that tbe announcement of
Generfll Schellendorf's resignation was
published in the Reichsanzeiger, ap
peared with their alleged inspired an
nouncements that the Minister of War
and the Kaiser had become reconciled
and that the Minister would retain his
post.
The Berlin Government continues to
actively support the initiative of Count
Goluchowski, Austrian Minister of For
eign Affairs, toward the solution of the
difficulties existing in Crete. Since Lord
Salisbury's rejection of the proposal to
establish a blockade around Crete, Count
Goluchowski has urged the Porte to grant
Â»new constitution to the island, the main
features of which are the appointment of
a Christian Governor and the establish
ment of Cretan financial autonomy, wiih
the payment of tribute to tbe Sultan
under the general guarantee of the Eu
ropean powers. The foreign Consul at
Oanea communicated the terms of Count
Goinchowski's proposal to the Christian
Deputies ol Crete on Friday, and although
tbe fighting between the Christians and
Turks on the island ts still in progress it
is the opinion in diplomatic circles here
that the Christians will accept the con
ditions, which are really tantamount to
autonomy with an annual payment of
tribute to the Porte based upon the ratio
of the revenues of the island.
Although tbe statistics of the current
harvests are still incomplete, a sufficient
numoer has been received at the Depart
ment of Agriculture upon which to ba-e
an estimate that there will be a medium
crop of wheat and rye in Germany and a
fine crop of both of these grains in Aus
tria-Hungary. Tbe general failure of the
cereal crops in Russia and the prohibition
of time operations on the bourses in Ger
many are leading to speculative transac
tions in import orders upon the chance
that a demand for the grain thus pur
chased will spring up. The agrarian news
papers are advising home producers to
hold on to their grain with the assistance
of bank advances, and the position points
to a reaction with Keen competition be
tween home-grown and imported grains.
Concerning thÂ« state of the crops in
Russia the concensus of opinion is that
the harvest there is an absolute failure.
The crops in the great southern arep are
fair, but in the basins of the Volga,
Dneiper and Don tbe general average is
very bad.
It is reported that a famine exists in the
Kherson districts of Southern Russia, and
that the local authorities are appealing; to
the Government for relief, cisc the people
must die from starvation.
The Schuhmarkt, the organ of the Ger
man shoauiakers, calls attention to the
report forwarded to the Stats Department
of this Government by F. H. Mason,
United States ConÃul-General at Frank
fort-on-Main, and denies that a single
American shoestore exists in Berlin. The
paper says that Mr. Mason in making the
statement that such stores did exist was
wrongly informed.
'No market exists in Germany for
American boots and shoes," the paper
adds, "for many reasons. German ma
chinery lor the manufacture of boots and
shoes is as pet feet as the American ma
chinery, and the shapes worn in America
would not do here."
The United States Consular .Agent at
Kiel has informed the representatives of
the United Associated Presses that tbe
United States Attorney-General has taken
up the case of tbe steamer Hermann,
which shipped at Li'oau, Russia, on Jan
uary 30, 1896, thirty emigrants who were
put on board the snip ana treated in such
an inhuman manner that six of them died
and tbe others narrowly escaped the same
fate. It appears that the six who died
were locked in a close compartment of the
vessel, and expired from suffocation a few
hours alter the ship had left the harbor of
Libau. The bodies of the dead men were
thrown overboard, and the survivors were
threatened with being brought back to
Russia if they revealed the fate of their
companions.
The Emperor gave a luncheon to thfÂ»
Third Regiment of Foot Guards yesterday
after unveiling a monument to the
memory of the soldiers of the German
army who had fallen in battlefields, and
in the course of the entertainment made a
rather long speech, ending with his never
ceasing theme of implicit obedience tothe_
King. M hope," he said, "t.-at this regij
ment, in case I should be forced to cal
upon them to go to war, will go as duti
fully to death for me as they did for my
grandfather, the great Emperor Wil
liam I."
The Deutsche Landwirthschaft Presse
demands that the (iovernment issue a de
cree completely locking out from Germany
all agricultural animals, from horses to
poultry, coming from countries where pro
tective measures against Germany exi3t.
The Yolks Zeitung, in an article com
menting upon this demand, says; "If
this piece of madness is carried out, the
people will be starved for the sake of fat
tening the landlords."
The Hamburg Correspondenz, a semi
official organ, demands that energetic
steps be at once taken to protect German
interests in Samoa against the encroach
ments of American adventurers. The
paper asserts that Americans are actively
seizing the trade in Samoa, ignoring the
international arrangements entirely.
The Freisinnige Zeitung, replying to
this article, says that Samoa is not worth
quarreling over with the United Slates
and England.
The Russian police will co-operate with
the Beriin police in the matter of guard
ing the Czar and Czarina upon the occa
sion of their coming visit to Breslau. A
large number of members of tbe Russian
secret police will arrive at Breslau several
days before the arrival of the Imperial
party.
The railroads touching Berlin will sus
pend freight traffic during the presence of
the Czar in Germany, and a special watch
will be kept at Hamburg, Bremen and
other ports to prevent an entry ot sus
picious persons or explosives. These pre
cautions are being taken upon the strength
of reports that the anarchists in London
have been plotting against the Czar's life.
The German * Government rpquests
Americans desiring to visit the German
schools to make their applications for per
mits through the Government in Wash

CUBAN LEADERS TO MEET
Plans for the Future Conduct of
Freedom's Battle Will
Be Discussed.
Armies of Gomez and Maceo, It Is
Thought, Will Shortly Assume
thef Aggressive.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Aug. 23.â 1t is
said that within the next month General
Estrada Palma, Minister Plenipotentiary
of the Cuban Republic to tbe United
States, and Gonzales Quesada, the Secre
tary of Legation, with other prominent
supporters of the revolutionary cause, will
co to Cuba to consult with President Cis
nerios as to the future conduct of the
battle for freedom.
General Gomez and Maceo are both said
to have expressed the opinion that noth
ing can be accomplished uuder the pres
ent system of Hunting. â 
They do not want to go on struggling,
as during the ten years' war, with no hope
of gaining the freedom of the island un
less they secure recognition as belligerents
from the United States. To do ibis it is
claimed by both tbe commanders that
they must inaugurate a campaign of the
most destructive character. Hitherto
when parts of their armies have invaded a
town they have simply driven the Spanish
forces out and then have themselves re
treated.
Their plan now ia to make forced marches
upon all of the interior cities, and after
effecting the^r capture destroy them.
They cannot do this, however, without the
sanction of the Cuban Junta in the United
States, and it is for the purpose of settling
the issue thus raised that Palma, Quesada
and others have been summoned to the
island. How these leaders will get to
Cuba is. of course, a mystery to all save
themselves.
It is stated on good authority that three
larce expeditions are to be sent out from
different places in this country, ana that
they will unite and land at a designated
point. The vessels will be armed and pre
pared to fight if overtaken by Spanish
cruisers. At the same time that the three
large expeditions go out there will be
other ships sent to the coast as decoys.
The leaders of the movement have no ap
prehension of their ability to effect a
landing.
It is expected that the conference be
tween Cisnerios, Palma, Quesada and
others. will result in a dtcteiou to start the
armies of both Gomez and Muceo on the
aggressive about the Ist of October ana
that when a town is captured it will be
destroyed.
Maceo, it is said, would like to inang*
urate a line of action something akin to
Sherman's march to the sea, and it is be
lieved that he will have his way.
CYCLONS STRIKES A CIRCUS
Several Animal* Escape From Ihtir
CngÂ«Â», t, u t Are Hecaptured.
HUNTINGTON, Ind., Aug. 23,â The
Wallace circus was struck by a small cy
clone in this city last night and the can
vas torn to shreds. Several animals es
caped from broken ca^es, but were recap
tured. Four men were slightly injured by
falling poles. The damage amounted to
fully $10,000. The storm struck before the
doors had been opened to admit the peo
ple. During the storm fourteen barns in
this county were struck by lightning and
destroyed, causing a loss of $20,000.
GRAND ARMY REUNION.
Lively Scene* at CÂ«mp Fair child, Sear
Lincoln, Â£ebrnnka. -'.â -â 
LINCOLN, Nebb., Aug. 23.â Supplies
for an army of from 50,000 to 75,000 men
are now on the grounds at Camp Fair
child, one mile from the city, the seat of
the Nebraska Grand Army reunion, which
was thrown open to the public this morn
ing. The reunion proper does not begin
until to-morrow, but a Sunday programme
of religious service and music was carried
out to-day. The attendance during the
week promises to be large, 1000 tents being
already occupied. Political discussions
will not be barred, and Candidate Bryan
is on tbe programme for a speech, but of
course he cannot be present in view ol hiÂ«
more recent itinerary.
MILITARY AND
NAVAL AFFAIRS,
Army Circles Interested in
the Matter of Coast
Defense.
LARGE SUM NECESSARY
Reports of Generals Miles and
Craighill to Secretary
Lament
OVERHAULING OLD MONITORS.
Admiral Bonce's Squadron to Be Kept
in Fighting Trim for
Emergencies-
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 23.â Great
interest is felt in army circles in the ex
pected recommendations to Congress at
its next session in the matter of coast de
fense. Major-General Miles recently
made an inspection of northeastern points
where batteries are needed, and has sub
mitted his recommendations to Secretary
Lamont. Brigadier-General Craighill,
chief of the corps of engineers, has re
turned from an inspection of the New
England coast and of Fort Montgomery
on Lake Cbamplain. Both of these of
ficials will make strong recommendations
for pressing the work of coast defense.
General Miles has practically outlined
this feature of his report and will urge
tha necessity of sufficient appropriations.
His recommendations will cover not only
tbe Atlantic coast, but tbe Pacific coast as
well. General Craighiil will submit his
estimates for tbe work, and ii is certain
that he will not ask for a small sum.
Under the terms of the last fortifications
act he was allowed about $5,000,000, a
minor portion of which was immediately
available, the remainder to be spent under
the continuing contract system.
In his estimate for next year's work
General Craighill will tsk for $5,000,000, to
be immediately available upon the passage
of the act. It is poi.ited out that with
such small appropriations as much as fif
teen years will be required to get the
coasts in a proper condition of defense.
General Craighill's tour, just completed,
included Fort Knox, on the Penobscot
river, not now occupied, but which in his
opinion should be supplied with a garri
son; Fort Pophain, at the mouth of the
Kennebec River, and most of the harbors
along tbe New England coast, including
Boston, Newport, Narragansett Bay, etc.
He also visited Fort Montgomery. While
on his tour, General Craighill also in
spected some river and harbor work. He
is satisfied with tbe progress the work is
making with the present limited appropri
ation, but feels that it should be pushed
more rapidly.
Brieadier-General Flakier, chief of ord
nance, did net intimate before his de
parture how much he would want from
the next Congress. It is roughly esti.
mated that as much as $15,000,000 will be
asked for at the next session.'
There is strong probability that an at
tempt will be made during the coming
session of Congress to secure legislation
creating the grade of lieutenant-colonel in
the Signal Corps. This will be done for the
beneht of Major H. C. Dunwoody, The pro
posed measure will not increase the num
ber of officers in tbe corps, but will reduce
tbe number of lieutenants to three. Of
ficers or the corps say this action is neces
sary because of the small chance of
any retirements in senior grades.
Brigadier-General Greely, chief signal
officer, will not retire until 1906,
and in the interim a number
of officers older than he will be rele
gated to the retired list. There has been
talk for some years that General Greely
would retire on his own application, but
this gos3ip has proved to be without
foundation, and the probabilities are now
that lie will remain in active service.
It is understood that the forthcoming
annnal reports of bureau chiefs will con
tain little that is new in tbe way of recom
mendations. Major-Gonetal Miles, com
manding the army, will have an interest
ing report, and will make a number of
valuable suggestions, looking to the im
provement oi the condition of officers and
men. He will forcibly urge upon Con
gress the necessity of passing the reorgani
zation bill proposed by the War Depart
ment during last session.
In accordance with resolutions of Con
gress the United S ates steamship Alba
tross has been detailed by the President
to assist a commission appointed by the
Executive to make a scientific investiga
tion of fur seals on the Pribylof, Com
mander and Kurile islands. The com
mission is composed of Dr. David Starr
Jordan, president of Leland Stanford Jr.
University; Lieutenant-Commander Jef
ferson F. Mose, U. S. N., commanding the
Albatross; JJr. Leon Hard Stejneger of the
Natio.nal Museum, Dr. ff. A. Lucas of the
National Museum and Charles H. Town
send of the Fish Commission. The Alba
tross arrived at Unalaska July 3 And will
proceed at once on the work. She carried
both tha American and British Commis
sioners.
The Carnegie Steel Company is pushing
its work on the armor it is manufacturing
for thÂ« battle-ships Kearsarge and Ken
tucKy. It has informed the Navy Depart
ment that it has all the casement plates
from 10 to 12 inches in thickness and the
f>lates for tbe forward 13-inch barbettes,
rom 15 to 17 inches in thickness, ready
for machining, and asks that it be fur
nished with final plans. Ttt^se are now
being prepared at tbe Navy Department.
The steel company is said to be pushing
its material for the purpose of showing
that it is able to keep pace with if not
ahead of the hull construction.
While Cuba is in a state of insurrection
Secretary Herbert will not create me naval
reserve he has in contemplation. This is
the opinion of the officers of the Navy
Department, notwithstanding tbe Secre
tary's action in ordering the board to
make recommendations governing the
creation of such reserve. Instead of lay
ing up ships in ordinary it is the intention
of the Navy Department to place addi
tional ships in commission.
The monitor Puritan, whioh is to be
completed by order; >f the Secretary this
fall, will be at on. ordered into active
service. The cruiser Brooklyn, upon the
completion of her preliminary acceptance
trial the latter part of this month, will
have the finishing touches placed upon
her, and in October next will receive her
officers and crew. It was the intention of
the Secretary to place the torpedo-boat
Ericsson in commission, but the unfortu
nate accident of a few days ago at the New
York navy-yard: prevents this for some
time to come. The Brooklyn and Puritan
when commissioned will be attached to
toe -North Atlantic squadron.
It is possible that after the naval ma
neuvers one or two vessels may be laid op
at the navy-yards for several months re
ceiving necessary repairs, particularly the
New York, The Bjoofciyn, being supplied
with flag officers' quarters, could be useM
in the place of the New YorK as flagshi|
of the station. Another indication of the
intention of the authorities is the fact
that they are enlisting men daily to take
the places of those whose time is about to
cx .P ;re - In this way ail of tne ships of Ad
miral Bunce's squadron have been practi
cally remanned with sailors whose terms
of enlistment will not expire or are begin
ning. It is the expectation of well-in
formed officers at the Navy Department
that the fleet will cruise on the North At
lantic coast until October, then receive
necessary repairs at the navy-yard, and
about tbe middle of December or early in
the new year wiii go to the Caribbean Sea
to continue maneuvers. Any recom
mendations of the Naval Reserve Board
will hardly be put in operation, they
think, until the close of the rebellion in
Cuba.
One of the most significant actions of
the Navy Department is the repairing of
the machinery of all the old single-turret
monitors, with the exception of two
which require new boilers and for which
no appropriation is available. These
monitors have been distributed along the
North Atlantic coast and have been
placed at ports where they could do
valuable work in case defense were neces
sary. An officer of the navy stated that
these monitors, with the exception of
some little injury to their hulls, are in as
good condition to-day as they were dur
ing the war. They can steam ail about
the harbors they are in, he vaid, and
could take a position in the middle of the
channel where they could do much to
annoy an enemy trying to pass. It ia
true they are armed only with smooth
bore guns, but at short range they would
be of some use, and if the vessels were
sunk they would effectually blockade the
chancel of the harbor.
VENCEDOR AND CANADA,
Yachting Enthusiasts Flocking
to Toledo to Witness the
Great Race.
Canadians Confident of Victory, as
the American Boat Is Badly
Handicapped.
TOLEDO, .Ohio, Aug. 23.â Everything is
in readiness lor the international yacht
race between the Vencedor and Canada,
and every train and boat is bringing hun
dreds of yachting enthusiasts from Chi
cago, Detroit, Milwaukee end Buffalo, to
gether with a few from New York and
other Eastern cities. Both boats were
measured yesterday. So far as could be as
cer tamed in advance of tbe official an
nouncements tbe measurements are as
follows:
Canadaâ Length over all 55.21; water
line, 37.04; boom, 42.85; gaff, 24.42; hoist of
maingail, 24.55. Vencedorâ Length over
all, 62,73; water line, 43; boom, 46.90; gaff,
27.80; hoiÃt of mainsail, 26.30.
The Canadians are confident that their
boat will win, for tbroueh Commodore
Bernman's anxiety to get in a race at all
hazards he has handicappea the Vencedor
so that it is extremely doubtful if she wlil
be able to win in anything but a blow.
Captain Barb.'Ur, however, siili has con
fidence in the Vencedor, and to-niprht said
that in any sort of a breeze the Chicago
yacht will win.
Off RiversMe Pnrk, in the Maumee
River, where the challenged boat, and de
fender are anchored, there is a. great fleet
of Canadian and American yachts from
almost every part of the great lakes, and
at "colors" this morning, several acres
of parti-colored bunting were flun -> to the
breeze. The spectacle drew thousands of
people to the snore.
Shortly before noon the Vencedor went
out for a trial spiv and made one circuit of
the tavelve-mile trianÂ»le. The trial was
very satisfactory, for the Vencedor in
a good stiff breeze, with only her working
topsail, covered the twelve knots, which
included four miles of windward work, in
1 hour and 52 minutes. In consequence of
the Vencedor's sail area being found in ex
cess of the limitation by official measure
ment, it was decided to reduce the canvas
by using the o'd mainsail, which does not
set well.

DEL MONTE, Cal., Aug. 23.â The race
track and polo grounds are at last, after
bard woris and much expense, ready for
the events that will begin on Tuesday.
L. D. Norton, who originally surveyed
the grounds and who has for the past few
weeks been superintending the prepara
tions for the coming meet, has finally an
nounced the work completed. He* haa
made a fine job of it, for track and
grounds are in p^rime condition in every
way, and, except for daily sprinkling and
sweeping, is just as Burlingame will uÂ«e
It. The polo grounds in particular are in
much better condition than last year, for
the earth has been packed and scraped
level, treacherous holes filled and stones
taken off, so tbere will now be almost no
danger, either to men or ponies, in the
event of falls. The stone wall for the
steeplechase has also been softened by
being well covered with turf.
In a number of events the owners of
horses will ride. Among the well-known
riders who will be seen in the saddle are:
W. S. Hobart, R. M. Tobin, P. D. Martin,
Charles I- Baldwin, J. Lawson, Bnron

tween the "Reds"â Messrs. Joseph Tobin
Jr., first; Walter S. Hobart, second; Jo
seph Tobin, third; Perry Eyre, fourth;
and the "Blues"â Captain A. F. Wain
wright, first; J. Lawson. second; Charles
Baldwin, third; R. M. Tobin, fourth.
Both are Burlingame teams. A club from
Riverside or Santa Monica will contest
with the victorious four from Burlingame.
The paper chase is scheduled for Wednes
day, and that day is to be given up to it
entirely. This will, of course, be the so
ciety event of tha meet, and in anticipated
with more pleasure by the ladies than any
other feature, except, perhaps, the drag
procession. Captain WainwriÂ«ht has laid
out the course, and it comprises between
seven and ten miles of cross-country rid
ing, with some very pretty doubles and
false acents. The bearers will be Mrs.
Crooks, Mrs. Neave and Miss Warburton.
J. F. J. Archibald, R. M. Tohin, Captain
A. F. Walnwright anct all who can procure
a mount will combine themselves into an

this was the only way to secure interna

his remarks to the railroad question, giv

MONTEITH IS FIRM.
Again Declares He Will Xot Withdraw to
Promote fusion. .
GUERNEVILLE, , Cal., Aug. 23.â
George W. Monteith, Populist candidate
for Congress in this district, addressed a
large audience here last night. The audi
tors were of both sexes and of all political
complexions, but , they were seemingly in
sympathy with the speaker in his impas
sioned denunciation of the Southern Pa
cinc Railroad and its methods. He de
clared his intention of staying in the
fight, whether indorsed by the Democrats
or not, and the statement drew a hearty
cheer. He complimented his opponent,
Judge Barnam, the Republican candidate,
upon his splendid anti-railroad record in
Congress, and declared that Huntingdon
would be between two fires in this district.
Monteith was loudly cheered when he ve
hemently declared :
â¢ "l spurn them as I scorn, them; I defy
them as I detest them, and they shall not
crucify me on a railroad double cross." .

GLEN ELLEN, Cal., Aug. 23.â The
spirit of the free open air was imbibed
rather freely by the League of the Cross
cadets from San Francisco immediately
after their arrival at Camp O'Ryan. The
boys, of course, readily accustomed them
selves to the restraint of a military en
campment, but that was before supper had
refreshed them last night. They had dress
parade and guard mount, and after that
amused themselves by running into
barbed-wire fences, orchards and the
guard-house, so that, it was still quite
early in the night when a baif-dozen
youthful warriors were enjoying soothine
lotions to themselves in the hospital, and
as many more were on the penitent stool,
down where the guards held sway.
Camp was organized with the following
officers, who were on duty until 6 o'clock
this evening:
Officer of the day, Captain Edward P. Fitz
gerald; officer of the guard, Lieutenant David
A. Barry; acting adjutant, Lieutenant C. J.
Regan; sergeant-major, Sergeant James
Lamey; sergeants of the guard, Robert Can

T. Leary. Members of the guard : Company Câ

Phelan.
Dr. A. P. Mulligan, surgeon of the regi
ment, organized the hospital corps, with
Lieutenant C. Kennedy as assistant and
Privates Frank Clark and Louis Healy as
extra assistants.
When morning dawned on the camp an
animated and pretty scene was presented
to visitors. The camp nestles snugly on a
level stretch, framed with great old oaks,
madrones and the shambling foliage of
the river side. There is a single street,
with rows of tents on each side, leading
up to a double-cross line, where the officers
and guests are quartered. A tall flag
pole has been planted in the open and
from it the stars and stripes are waving.
At headquarters, too, the American flag is
used in decoration. Hidden by trees and
climbing viues the caterer, an old National
Guard officer, holds forth, and it is there
in a veritable summer-bower the cadets
enjoy their meals.
Reveille sounded at 5:40 a. m. to-day
and at 6, the second call, brought the
companies into line. The muster roll was
as follows:

Breakfast call was at Ba. m., and soon
afterward tne regiment was put through a
variety of evolutions by Captain H. P.
Filgate. The boys drilled in battalion for
an hour, center forward, fours left and
riynt, formed a line to right of company's
rear into column. Theu the companies
broke from right to march to left, right
front into line of companies and columns
of fours and changed direction to right in
columns of fours, all without a break or
error. Sword exercise was gone through
for quite a long time, and Captain Filgate
said that in his thirty years' experience in
military affairs he never saw more admira
ble work by young soldiers. The cadet
officers showed a remarkable proficiency
and knowledge of tactics.
Camp order 1 was issued detailing Cap
tain Fitzgerald as adjutant, Serjreaut La
mie as sergennt-majur and Sergeant Crow
ley as provost sergeant.
Immediately after the arrival of the
morning train from ths City the boys wel
comed their numerous visitors and then
prepared to assist at the military mass.
The regiment marched with its flag and
drum corps fours frunt to a large pavilion
at one end of the park. Here a temporary
altar had been erected. It was covered
with white and also bunches of fragrant
flowers. The regiment marched into the
pavilion from the rear and quickly formed
three sides of a hollow square in front of
the altar. There was a lame number of
people present and they remained outside
the lines of the cadets. Sergeant Frank
Uolligan of Company G attended Father
McDonald at the mass. The cadets
saluted when the gospel was read, and
d urine the consecration they knelt and
gave their unique salute with drawn
sabers. One of the young fellows, who had
been on guard duty all night and was
weak from the strain upon him, fell in a
faint. His comrades nearest him broke
ranks aiid ran to his assistance. They
carried him outsid9 where he soon recov
ered.
Father McDonald spoke briefly on the
gospel of the day, which tells of the leper
Samaritan, whose faith had made him
whole. The lesson drawn from this was
that people do not return thanks for the
goodness of God and that they should
foilow the example of the outcast Samari
tan. The chaplain, speaking to the cadets,
advised them in regard to their rule of
conduct during life. While in camp he
particularly requested them to act like
gentlemen, and then they would gain tne
respect of the people here and reflect
honor upon the League of the Cross.
After the military mass the cadets re
lieved themselves of their fatigue hats
and tunics and hastened to dinner, and
that over they went swimming and stroll
ing at thoir own sweet will through the
country. Many of the boys wore white
canvas suits that were becoming, but they,
too, left the camp, which was almost de
serted during the afternoon.
At dress parade this evening the follow
ing officers were chosen to govern the
camp from 6 A. m. until 6 p. m. to-morrow:
Officer of the day, Captain E.
J. Power; officer of the guard,
First Lieutenant E. Crowley; sergeant
of the guard, Sergeant A. Hynes;
corporal of the guard, Corporal Henry
Hay; members of the guard Company B,
privates W. Clancy, F. Grumley, T. Gard
ner, R. O'Neill and G. Guthberwon; Com
pany C, privates D. Mclnerney, C. Lucy,
J. O'Brien, J. Brady, M. Kane and W.

SANTA CRUZ ADVENTURE,
Mrs. Cox Hill of Fresno and a
Companion Rescued From
the Surf.
The Plucky Woman Almost Drowned
While Teaching a Young Man
to Swim.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Ansr. 23.â The
loungers on the beach at the Neptune
baths at noon to-day were Btartled by a
cry for help from a woman a hundred
yards away from shore and in the vicinity
of the raft which is the objective point of
all ambitious swimmers, Colonel Ralph
Miller, who was in the shallow water of
the surf with a party of friends, heard
the cry and recognized Mrs. Cox fliil of
Fresno as the endangered bather. He
called out in response: "You are all
right, just Keep cool." The loungers on
the sands could see the woman struggling
with Harry Postlethwaite of Los Gatos,
and there was great danger that both
would go down before Colonel Miller could
reach them.
When Colonel Miller hod swam to the
pair Postlethwnite was exhausted and was
clingina to Mrs. Hill in such a way that
she could not have supported him much
longer. He separated them and aided
Mrs. Hill to reach the life line that con
nects the raft with the shore. Then he
turned his attention to Postlethwaite,
who was so nearly unconscious as to be
not only helpless but a burden.
The colonel "duckel" him, but he was
obliged to repeat this twice before he
could controi the half drowning man and
Dear him to shore.
The young man who so narrowly es
caped death is, with his wife and a
brother, occupying a summer cottage
here. He is just learning to swim, and
Mrs. Hill, who is here with the Colonel
Trevely an party of Fresno, had gone out
with him this morning to give him the
benefit of her experience, for she is an ex
cellent swimmer. She did not realize that
he had become so ureatly exhausted until
his ft-et dropped ana his body hunc limp
in the water. Then the struggle began,
and as Mrs. Hill remarked after it was all
over, she "hadn't the heart to 'duck'
him," and that is where she made her
mistake.
Won by Stockton's Team.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 23.â The best
baseball game of the season was played
to-day between the Will & Fincks of San
Francisco and the regular Stocttton team.
Beside the regular percentage of the gate
rpceipts, the teams played for a wager of
$100 a side. The Stockton team won after
a hard struggle by a score of 10 to 4.

HUMSINDO ALAND'S CRIME.
Killed a Fellow M zican, but Claims
the Homoclde Was Due to
Accident.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 23. â Andreas
Martinez, a Mexican, aged 30 years, was
instantly killed in a saloon at Firebaugh
early this morning by Humsindo Alano,
another Mexican. Alano is about 28 years
old.
A lynching party started after Alano,
but he was secreted by a friendly bar
tender in Ike Meyer's hotel. Alano lay in
t&e cellar for several hours while the vil
lagers were scouring every house in search
of him. Shortly after noon Deputy
Sheriffs Timmins and Bedford arrived
from Fresno and Alano was glad to put
himself into their charge. The mob was
in another part of the village at the time
and the deputies made their stay in Fire
bavgn as brief as possible. 'While the
lynchers were yet hunting for Alano in
Firebaugh the officers had arrived at Men
dota, twelve miles away, and had him in
jail.
Coroner Long arrived from Fresno just
about the time officers reached Mendota
and hastened on to Firebaugh to hold the
inquest. Alano told the officers that he
was in a saloon early this morning and
asked the bartender if there was any ob
jection to his shooting at a mark across
the street The bartender made no objec
tion, and Alano fired three shots. Just
then Martinez stepped into the doorway
and received the fourth shot in his breast.
There has been a long era of lawlessness
among the mixed population of Fire
baugh. It is remote from centers of civ
ilization, and a few months ago the resi
dent Justice of the Peace, W. S. Crawford,
moved to Mendota to insure his personal
safety.
Martinez, the victim, was married, but
had no children. Alano is a single man.
POWER FOR SAN JOSE.
Negotiations Pending Between Local Cor
porations and the Big Creek
Company.
SAN JOSE, Cal, Aug. 23.â The Big
Creek Power Company of Santa Cruz, is
negotiating with the managers of the elec
tric light and car systems of this city to
supply electric power from the Big Creek
plant. F. W, Bwanton, manager of the
Big Creek company, has been in the city
several days, and, it is said, he has met
with some encouragement.
The plant of the Big Creek company is
located eighteen miles from Santa Cruz
and twenty-six miles from San Jose, and
at present is of 1000 horsepower. Only
500 horsepower is used in supplying the
Seaside City, and it is proposed to furnish
the surplus power to this city provided the
necessary arrangements can be made. It
is also proposed by the Big Creek com
pany to huild an additional reservoir that
will supply sufficient water to run the
dynamo three days, and which will admit
of an additional 500 horsepower.
From the reservoir now in use a pipe
line 1920 feet has been constructed, and in
this distance a fall of 923 feet is obtained

GIACIXTO ZA.HCOXE DEAD.
Fasting of an Italian Patriot Who Won
Honor by Mis Valor.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 23.â Giacinto
Zarcone, who has for nearly thirty years
been a resident of San Jose, died to-day
after an illness of two weeks. '
He was 59 years of age and a native of
Sicily. He was a veteran of the war for
the independence of Italy, joining the
army when he was 23 years of age and re
maining in the field until the patriots were
successful.
Subsequently he received a bronze medal
for meritorious services in the war.
In 1884 Zarcone came to America, and
in 1865 opened a barber shop in San Jose.
He was a member ot the Italian Benevo
lent Society, San Jose Hussars, Knights
of Pythias and the Ancient Order of
Druids.
STOKTON RAAILWAY PROJECT.
The Line to the Sierra Nevada Mines Sow
Seems Assured.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 23.â Thomas S.
Bullock, the New York capitalist, who is
back of the project to run a railway from
this city eastward into the mining region
of the Sierra Nevada, arrived yesterday.
It is almost certain that the road will be
built. Nearly eighty miles of rails have
arrived in California! shipped by Mr. Bul
lock, and they are to be laid somewhere in
this State. The most promising region
are the mines, which are steadily growing
in output and population and which offer
a splendid field for railroad operations.
They need quick communication with the
ocean and the only feasible route is by
way of this city, which is their natural
entreport.
The first part of the right of way can be
obtained at any time and after reaching
the foothills there will be no trouble in
getting land for the road. It would not
be surprising if the work of laying the
rails should be commenced next month.
A BOON TO SACRAMENTO
Claus Spreckels' Plans for the
Establishment of a Sugar
Factory.
H3 Is Willing to Erect the Plant If
the Farmers Will Raise
Beets.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Aug., 23,-P. W.
Morse, representing Claus Spreckels, met
the Chamber of Commerce at the Sutter
Club this evening and gave the members
some information regarding the possibili
ties of beet culture in suitable soil.
Mr. Morse is trie assistant superinten
dent of the Watsonville beet-sugar fac
tory, and was sent to this locality by Mr.
Spreckels to investigate the adaptability
of the soil here for beet-sugar culture.
The plan which met with his approval
was that a committee be appointed to in
duce a large number of farmers to plant
experimental acreage and send samples to
him for analysis.
No farmer, he said, need plant a piece
of ground more than a few leet square,
and he would determine from the samples
sent what ground was suitable and what
was not. If 30,000 acres of good ground
could be obtained, and the farmers would
agree to plant that much to beets, a
factory, he believed, would be started by
Mr. Spreckels.
At Watsonville, he said, the farmers
were raising from twelve to twenty-five
tons to the acre and were getting $4 a ton.
Where the ground was good for beet cul
ture the farmers were getting rich.
Mr. Spreckels' plan was to contract with
the farmer to raise beets for two years,
and after tnis he made annual contracts
at such a time of year as to allow the
farmer to plant any kind of a crop he saw
fit. provided he did not find beets profita
ble. The fact that this was done showed
the faith his employer had in the industry.
It showed that he was so sure that beets
would prove highly profitable to the
farmer that he was willing to put a great
dsal of money into a factory and trust to
the farmer maintaining his crop of sugar
beets.
Should a factory be started here, he said,
it would be as large as that to be started at
Salinas, the machinery for which was
en route and which was to be the largest
beet sugar factory in the United States.
The members of the Chamber of Com
merce were very much impressed and at a
meeting soon to be held steps will be
taKen to get farmers to raise experimental
crops of beets.

LOS ANGELES'
BUILDING BOOM,
Fifteen Millions Invested in
New Structures Within
Five Years.
FINE RECORD FOR 1896.
Nearly Fourteen Hundred Per
mits Issued From January I
to August I.
DWELLINGS REARED BY SCORES
Ten Churches Included in the Ac-
quisitiens of the City in
1895.
Following: is the second of a series
of articles prepared under the super
vision of the three commercial bod
ies of Los Angeles â the Chamber
of Commerce, Board of Trade and
Merchants' and Manufactures' As-
sociation â showing the growth of
population and recent endustrial
development in that enterprising
city and vicinity :
The building boom which Los Angeles
has been enjoying for the last five years
goes on apace. It was thought that the
climax was reached last year when the
City Superintendent of Buildings issued
2415 permits for building improvements,
approximating in cost nearly $4,000,000.
This was exclusive of the outlay of $238,000
by the city for new schoolhouses and
$80,000 for a central police station.
Much of the vrork for which permits
were granted in 1895 was, of course, not
completed within the year, so even if no
additional work had been undertaken saw,
plane and hammer would hare kept up
their merry chorus until now. Building
operations projected during the the first
seven months of 1896, however, exceed in
volum3 those for the corresponding period
of 1895, though the estimated cost is not
so great.
Up to August 1, this year, 1388 building
permits, aggregating -an expenditure of
$1,704,324, were granted, as against 1346
permits, aggregating $2,284,397, for the
same period last year. This in spite of
the general financial depression, which
has arrested progress in Los Angeles to
some extent as well as throughout the
country.
The following comparative table, taken
from the City Building Superintendent's
last annual report, presents in a concise
iorm the growth of building operations in
Los Angeles during the last four years:

it should be stated that the actual cost
in many instances far exceeds the esti
mate given in the application for a per
mit. This is especially true in regard to
most of the large* business blocks, some of
which cost twice the amount originally
intended. In view of this fact it would be
no exaggeration, perhaps, to say that $12,
-000,000 was invesied in new buildings in
Los Aneeles during the four years named,
and 13,000,000 more can safely be added ior
the improvements that will be made dur
ing the present year.
ALL NEW GROWTH.
It must he admitted that $15,000,000 in
vested in new buildings in five years is not
a bad showing for a city that has suffered
no conflagration or other disaster that
would cause rebuilding. The buildings
erected have not been put up to replace
others which were accidentally destroyed,
though not a few have the place of old
ones which were found inadequate for the
demands of modern living and business.
Ihe increase in habitations and business
bouses may all be properly termed new
growth.
In this connection it is interesting to
note that the Chief of the Fire Depart
ment estimates the fire loss in Los An
geles at only $50,000 during the year 1895.
This includes furniture, Roods, etc. The
actual loss on buildings, was, perhaps,
only half the total amount, or $25,000.
There have been no expensive fires in Los
Angeles in recent years, which fact is
probably accounted for by the very
efficient Fire Department which ths city
maintains. It cannot, therefore, be
charged that the building energy in Los
Angeles is founded on anything other
than actual prosperity. The millions that
have gone into new buildings here have
not been furnished by insurance compa
nies, as was tne case with Seattle and sev
eral other Western towns which have had
phenomenal building booms in conse
quence of destructive conflagrations.
Another thing that is remarkable about
the buildings of Los Angeles is that they
are nearly all occupied as soon as com
pleted; and despite the many new edifices
constantly springing up desirable proper
ties continue to command high rents.
Few good buildings have been erected in
tne last few years that have not proved
paying investments from the start, and
quite a number of blocks erected some
years ago which were then considered re
mote from the business center are now
yielding an income for the first time. But
while this is true it is but fair to state that
owing to the shifting of the business cen
ter tnere are some DuiJdings which were
paying big interest on the money invested
in them half a dozen years ago that are
now comparatively deserted or given
over to a cheaper class of tenants.
TBKND OF BU6IKESS.
The trend of business is southwest from
the plaza, which, up to the time of the
real estate boom of 1886-87, was the vir
tual business center. Now it has moved
as far south as Spring and Second streets,
and, as newer and better buildings are
springing up below that point, the larger
firms whicn formerly did business in the
vicinity of the plaza are forsaking their
old quarters ana occupying the more
modern structures on Broadway, Spring
and Main streets, south of Second.
While Los Angeles is essentially a city
of homes, tne number and character of
its business blocks is beginning to attract
attention. Tne first thing that strikes the
casual visitor Is the size and elegance of
some of the recently erected palaces of
trade. The tenderfoot who comes here ex
pecting to see naught but the one-story
adobe bu'ldings or frame shacks common
to a large portion of the wild and woolly
West is most agreeably disappointed. The
stately brick, stone and steel structures,
whose towering facades run up four, five
and six stories along some of the principal
streets, impress the newcomer most favor
ably and convince him that Los Angcies
is indeed a growing commercial center.
Before making specific mention of any of
these new blocks, the report of the Super

intendent of Buildings will again be
drawn upon for some figures.
LAST TEAR'S RECORD.
The building operations during the year
1895 were classified by tbeSuperintendentof
Buildings, Charles L. Strange, as foilows:

Alterations, repairs, etc 361,158
Total $3,885,838
To this total should be added, he says,
$80,000 for the new central police station,
$238,000 for new schoolhouses and $100,000
for the Billiard block, all of which could
properly be counted aa part of the year's
operations and which would swell the
total to the magnificent sum of $4,303,838,
breaking all previous records* The super
intendent also takes occasion to remark
that the mortgages recorded during the
year represented iess than one-half the
amount expended in building construc
tion and real estate sales, all of which goes
to show a hign degree of prosperity.

In the construction of buisiness blocks
the line of greatest activity in the last two
year 3 lias loeen on Broadway, between
first and Seventh stieets. This thor
oughfare, which was until a few years ago
principally a residence street, is now one
of the busiest centers of retail trade, be
sides being headquarters for real estate
dealers and brokers of various kinds.
South Spring, South Main, Los Angeles,
Hill and the cross streets between First and
Ninth have also shared in the general ac
tivity, many costly edifices now occupying
sites until recently vacant or occupied by
insignificant buildings.
The best improvements made have been
in the shape of office buildings, some of
which are worthy of more than passing
notice, though to* mention all would be
tedions.
Among those distinguished for their
size, beauty and elegance of appointments
are the Bradbury, five stories, corner of
Third and Broadway; the Stimson, six
stories, Third and Spring; Wilcox, five
stories, Second and Spring; Bullard, five
stories, Spring, Main, Market; and Court;
Irvine, five stories, Third and Broadway;
Currier, five stories, Third street, between
Broadway and Spring; Bryson, five
stories, Second and Sprinc ; Van Nuys,
six stories, Fourth and Main; Perry, four
Btories, Fifth and Broadway; Stowell,
five stories. Spring, between Second and
Third; Freeman, three stories, Sixth and
Spring. Besides these are half a hundred
three and four story buildings of tha
modern type, built within the last few
years, all devoted to business purposes.
Others designed for large buildings, 3uch
as the Burdick block, corner of Spring
and Second : the German-American Sav
ings Bank building, corner of First and
Main, and the Hammel & Denker block,
Third and Spring, have been carried to
the height of only one or two stories for
tne time being, but will eventually be
raised to three or more stories, as business
conditions may warrant.
IMPOSING BTBCCTTraEfI.
One of the most imposing structures In
the city is the Van Nuys block, just near
ing completion. Although originally in
tended for a four-story building it has
been carried two stories farther. It is
built of white pressed brick, Venetian
renaissance style of architecture, and will
cost its owner close on to $200,000. Situ
ated at the northwest corner of Fourth
and Main streets, it is directly opposite
the Westminster Hotel and will form an
annex to that famous hostelrie, or else be
conducted as an indepeudnnt hotel. The
proprietor, I. N. Van Nuys, is president
of the Los Angeles Farming and Milling
Company, which owns the celebrated
Lankersnim ranch and is one of the
wealthiest corporations at this end of the
State. Another member of this corpora
tion who is investing considerable money
in building is Captain James B. Lanker
shim, who has broken pround for a mag
nificent five-story office and store building
at* the southeast corner of Third and
Spring streets. It will have a brownstone
front and will rival in architectural
beauty and massiveness the mammoth
Stinson block on the opposite corner.
Both Mr. Lankershim and Mr. Van Nuys

THE SAN. FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 1896.
Wilcox estate building, which graces the
southeast corner of Spring and Second
streets. This splendid structure has 120
teet frontage on Spring street and 157 on
Second, is five stories high and is con
structed of steel and gray sandstone. The
ground floor is occupied by stores-, railway
and steamship ticket offices and the Postal
Telegraph Company; the second, third
and fourth floors are occupied principally
by brokers and professional men; while
the entire fifth floor has been elegantly
furnished by the California Club, arfd will
henceforth be that swell organization's
home.
Next in importance to the Wilcox block
amone the new office buildings is the
Bullard block, which is located on the site
of the old courthouse, between Spring,
Main, Court and Market streets. J. A.
Bullard, the proprietor, is a thrifty Boston
capitalist, and he has spared no expense
in making this one of the finest office
buildings in the West. It is five stories
high, and each of its four fronts, while not
gaudy, is highly ornate. The material
used in the construction is steel and
pressed brick of a pinkish tint. The in
terior finish is in all respects on a par with
the handsome exterior.
The Byrne block, at the northwest corner
of Broadway and Third streets, owned by
Mrs. Margaret Irvine of San Francisco and
her brother, Callighan Byrne, is one of
the handsomest office buildings in the
city. Buff-colored pressed brick consti
tute its outside finish. It is splendidly
lighted from skylights and an interior
court, and although a mammoth building
contains not a single dark room.
Of all the splendid buildings in the city
none surpasses the Bradbury block in
cost, appearance or convenience. It
fronts 120 feet on Broadway, 180 feet on
Third street, is five stories fn heignt and
cost in the neighborhood of half a million
dollars. Brownstone and terra cdtta col
ored brick are the materials that show in
its outward construction, White, buff
and pink glazed brick line the walls of the
interior court, around which are wide
verandas. The rooms are in suites of two,
one fronting on the street, the other on
the central court. The apartments are all
large, light and airy, and are ideal office
rooms. The building was begnn by Lewis
A. Bradbury shortly before his death in
1892, and is a valuable portion of what is
known as the rich Bradbury estate.
THE BOSS BUILDER.
To T. D. Stinson, perhaps, more than
any other one man, is Los Angeles in
debted for the â¢inception of its building
boom. It remained for him by his exam-
Sle to give others courage to erect great
uildings in this city. Prior to his arrival
here in 1890 the Bryaon block was about
the only building over four stories in
height. Comparatively few went above
three stories up to that time. Mr. Stinson
having amassed a fortune in the lumber
trade in Michigan and other States, came
here expecting to live in retirement the re
mainder of his days, but the business op
portunities here appeared to him so good
that he was soon again actively engaged
in business affairs. He not only purchased
a site for a residence, upon which he
erected a house which cost $165,000, being
the finest private residence in Southern
California, but he likewise invested heavily
in business property. One of his first pur
chases was the northeast corner of Spring
and Third streets. The ground was occu
pied by a newly erected three-story brick
block, which was considered a handsome
building in its day, and a lesser brick
building of two stories. These structures
were too small for Mr. Btinson, so he be
gan to tear them down, a proceeding
which the old residenters, who were satis
fied with one-story shacks, considered al
most in the light of sacrilege.
The destruction of a new three-story
brick block to make room for a larger
building was something unheard of in
Los Angeles before Mr. Stinson 's advent,
but down it came, and a six-story steel
framed brick and terra cotta building,
after the Chicago style, went up in its
place. Mr. Stinson hes since erected
several other good buildings, among them
the Muskegon block, corner of Third and
Broadway, and a three-story block adjoin
ing the Muskegon, on Third street. He
has also purchased the Hammel <fc Denker
block, at the northwest corner of Third
and Spring streets, which he expects to
raise from one to several stories in the
course of time.
Whether Mr. Slinson's example spurred
others to build more extensively or not,
the fact remains that there has been great
activity in building circles ever since he
started in. His investments Iv Los An
geles foot up over $1,000,000.
THEEE ABE OTHERS.
A. P. Johnson and Captain B. F. Ball
are excavating for the foundation of a
$50,000 block on Main street, between
Fourth and Fifth. Another new building
that is in prospect will be located at the
northwest corner of Second street and
Broadway, on ground owned by President
I. W. Hellman of the Nevada Bank. It is
said to be Mr. Heliraan's purpose to erect
a block there that will rival in size and
magnificence any other building in the
city.
Among other buildings in course of con
struction or finished in the last year or
two are the following : By T. W. Brother
ton, three-story brick, on Broadway north
of First street, $17,000: Ralph Bros., three
stories, Sixth street, near Spring, $15,000;

could be added many others of equal
prominence.
HOME-MADE HOUSES.
A notable feature in the construction of
new business blocks in Los Angeles is the
improved style of architecture in vogue.
Plain brick and sheet-iron cornice fronts
have given way to stone, terra cotta or
pink, white or buff pressed brick. Most
of the materials uaed are of home manu
facture. Los Angeles pressed Drick are of
very superior quality and brick-making is
one of the leading local industries. Nearly
all the structural steel and iron used in
building is also of home manufacture.
Superb building stone is found in various
parts of Los Angeles County and large
quantities are imported from adjacent
counties and Arizona.
As stated at the outstart of this article
Los Anceles is a city of homes. Great as
the amount of money is that is being put
into businesj buildings a still greater
amount is being spent in building private
residences. Quite a number of residences
have been built in the last few years that
cost from $10,000 to $20,000, but by far the
greater number are the homes of working
men, costing from $1000 to $2000. New
residences costing from $3000 to $6000 are
also very numerous. Probably no other
city on the continent can boast more
pretty homes in proportion to population.
SAN DIEGO'S GAIN.
Pythian* May Erect a Home on the City
Parh Iract.
BAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 23â A decision
was rendered yesterday by Judge Puter
baugh in the casa of San Diego vs. E. W.
Morse, Bryant Howard, Charles S. Hamil
ton and M. A. Luce.executors of the will of
M. Pierce, deceased, whereby a lien is
foreclosed on 100 acres of land embraced in
the City Park. The decision recites that
the city set apart tne land to the defend
ants in trust for the purpose of establish
ing and maintaining tnereon an orphans'
home, boys and girls' home, kindergarten,
industrial school and school of technology.
The defendants planted a lar^e number
of trees on the land, which is the finest in
the park tract, and prior to October 1, 1891,
erected a house and barn and maintained
an orphans' home and kindergarten from
about October 1, 1891. No other buildings
were erected, and the defendants have
shown their inability to carry out their
part of the contract with th 9 city, hence
the land reverts to the city.
It is expected that the Grand Lodge of
the Kniguts of Pythias in this State will
r.ow take steps to establish a home for
aged Pythians, a resolution having been
adopted at the last meeting of the Grand
Lodge accepting an offer made by this
city, through Harry W. Vincent, for a
long term cf years, free of all cost and with
water free for all purposes. The offer of
the city was contingent upon the decision
rendered yesterday. The Pythians will
expend many tiiousands of dollars in fit
ting up the tract.
Drou-nxd at Knights Ferry.
OAKDALE, Cal., Aug. 23.â The body of
an unknown man was found in the Stan
islaus River at Knight 3 Ferry. He is sup
posed to have committed suicide. The
body had been in the water about twelve
hours.

Governor Budd, commander-in-chief of
the National Guard of California, has been
taking outdoor exercise on horseback in
the Sierras during the past two weeks. He
will be due in San Francisco this week. A
military conference is in prospect. It is
expected that Â£he Governor, Adjutant-
General Barrett, Major-General N. T.
James and the division adjutant, Colonel
Currier, will discuss Guard topics. It is
admitted that something must be done to
render the organization more effective.
The major-general perceives the necessity
of improvement in marksmanship, and
proposes that something shall be done to
promote rifle practice. As a preliminary
step measures will be taken to improve
the quality of ammunition. Many of the
guardsmen, in accounting for bad scores
at the rifle ranee, attribute the result to
defective ammunition. It is the judgment
of many officers that the purchase of am
munition during the past ten years has
been made in a careless manner. It is
contended that thorough inspection would
accomplish much good.
Major-General James, accompanied by
several officers of his staff, visited the
camp of Company B, First Infantry, at
Los Gatos last Saturday.
FIRST BRIGADE.
The encouraging report comes from the
First Brigade that a detachment of six
teen members of X Company. Seventh In
fantry, San Bernardino, recently made a
practice march of a hundred miles. In
marching endurance many of the organ
izations of the National Guard are lament
ably deficient, although they are capable
of making a fine appearance in the armory
or on well-paved streets. The marching
example of Company X may be emulated
by other companies.
PASADENA, Cal., Aug. 19.âGuards
men of Company I, Seventh Infantry,
held their first regular drill last Monday
evening after a rest of four weexs during
the heated term.
The drill was made in the open air
rather than in the armory and was wit
nessed by a large number of spectators.
Captain N. S. Bangham was in command,
and the company drilled, in extended
order with a system of signals, in addition
to those prescribed in the regulations, by
which the entire company is controlled
without verbal commands.
In spite of the absence of many of the
company on vacations about 80 per cent of
the company were in line Monday even
ing. A number of the boys went to Santa
Barbara last Saturday in charge of Ser
geant Lippincott, joining Company F of
Los Angeles for ten days' encampment.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Ace. 18.â
Sixteen members of Company X, Seventh
Infantry, returned' on Monday, evening,
August 17, from a two weeks' practice
march and camping trip through the San
Bernardino Mountains. The two squads
under command of a non-commissioned
officer left the armory on Saturday even
ing, August 1, at 10 o'clock, and arrived in
Bear Valley Monday, August 3, at 6 p. m.,
covering the distance of forty-five milas
over the roughest of mountain roads in
about fifty hours, every man coming into
camp in first-class condition and ready for
duty.
The regular routine of camp duties was
commenced immediately upon arrival,
and continued for six days, when tents
were struck and the return march begun
via Holcomb and Little Bear valleys. A
halt of two days was made at Ferncliffe,
the summer residence of Captain T. H.
Goff, the company commander, where the
boys were royally entertained by the cap
tain and his wife. The rest of the trip,
home was made without incident, ana
every man showed up for duty oa Monday
evening looking bronzed and soldierly
after their trip of over 100 miles.
The following promotions are announced
in the company for the month: Private
Charles H. Perry to be sergeant; Privates
B. W. Allen, F. J. Atkinson, William G.
Kaitt and Ed win T. Ireland to be corporals.
The average attendance for the month
of July was 81.22 per cent, a splendid
showing considering the extreme heat
during that period.
Sergeant J. Andy Pearce left the city on
August 4 to enter the State University at
Berkeley. By his departure the company
loses one of its most efficient non-commis
sioned officers and one of the truest
soldiers that ever shouldered a ritle. The
sergeant holds the company's gold medal
for the highest score made at the June
target practice.
SECOND BRIGADE.
Orders have been issued from brigade
headquarters in San Francisco directing
that an election for first and second lieu
tenants of Company H, First Infantry,
shall take place at the regimental armory
this evening at 8 o'c'ock. Major J. H.
Mangels, brigade quartermaster, is to pre
side. Lieutenant Henry C. Middleton has
been promoted and Lieutenant John J.
West's term has expired.
Captain William F. Chipman, Company
G, Fifth Infantry, Alameda, has resigned,
the resignation to take effect September
30. The reason given for resigning is that
business obligations require all of his time.
Second Lieutenant John Retter, Com
pany C, First Infantry, has tendered his
resignation on account of failing health.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Aug. 22. â The
armory of Company D, Fifth Infantry.
Captain William Elliott, has bad a rural
air this week, brought on by members of
the camp last Saturday night at Mill Val
ley. The evening march to camp occu
pied three hours, the men taking blankets
and commissary requisites, but no tents.
The company has a very high standing
and a bright history. Captain Elliott haa
been in command since 1890 and a com
missioned officer eleven years. Last year
the company stood first in its regiment for
skill in marksmanship. On its roster 1 are
the names of Colonel 3 Carlton Coleman
and J. Mervyn Donahue. The company
was originally a Blame and Logau club,
Captain Lauck president.
PET ALUM A, Cal., Aug. 22.â The ab
sorbing topic with the members of Com
pany C, Fifth Infantry, is the final and
deciding shooting match with Company E
of Santa Rosa, which will take place on
the first Sunday in September. The first
of the series being won by Company C
by about seventy-five points, and the
second being lost by only one point,
makes our boys rather hopeful that the
"rubber" will be theirs. The average at
tendance is about fifty. The members of
both Company E and Company C are
planning to go into camp together shortly.
THIRD BRIGADE.
MARYSViLLE, Cal., Aug. 22.â Before
the reorganization of the National Guard,
Marysville's military company, of which
her people will ever be proud, was known
as Company C, Eighth Infantry; now it is
titled Company D, Second Infantry.
Formally organized in January, 1890,
with G. B. Baldwin, captain; John T.
Lydon, first lieutenant, and George H.
Voss second lieutenant, the organization
has since held an enviable position
among the guards of Northern California.
On the parade grounds at home or in
camp, at muster or inspection, before the
targets or in the?face of the enemy, Marys
ville's soldier boys have never missed an
opportunity to distinguish themselves.
'Twas on May 19, 1895, that fifty of her
men met a like number of Captain Cook's
crack shots before the local butts and low
ered their colors, gaining the champion
ship of the world, whicn they still lay
claim to.
Each Sunday a large number of the
members indulge in practice work with
the rifle at their range south of town.
They propose to keep in condition to de
fend the reputation they have won as
marksmen.
The present officers of Company D are :
Captain, George H. Voss; first lieutenant,
Philip J. Diwer; second lieutenant,
David Canning; first sergeant, P. J. De
lay; second sergeant, F. W. Terstegge;
third sergeant, M. Nelson; fourth ser
geant. J. P. Colford; fifth sereeant, C.
Mayer. Corporalsâ First, G. W. Peyser;
second, J. Giblin; third, Chris Hovis;
fourth, W. Waldron; fiftn, J. P. Arnoldy;
sixth, J. L. Howard; seventh, George Mc-
Coy; eighth, John Selinger. Quarter
master sergeant, Bart Mornssey.
Colonel E. A. Forbes, who recently suc
ceeded to the position, resides at Marys
ville.
MERCED, Cal., Aug. 21.â Company H
of the Sixth Infantry, located at Merced,
bad an impromptu high jinks after its
regular drill last Monday evening. A few
friends were asked in to enjoy the re
freshments and have a general good time
with the soldiers. Sergeant Poiter han
dled the guitar. Sergeant Guthrie exe
cuted his famous Seventh Regiment snake
dance and Corporal Muller executed a few
bars of the real Dutch war whoop. The
sandwiches were eaten and the lemonade
drank, and everybody went home, having
enjoyed a pleasant time and the invited
friends have a new opinion of the social
side of the National Guard. Hecruits are
coming in regularly, and the company ex
pects to make a good showing for numbers
on its trip to StocKton on the 9th.
WOODLAND, Cal., Aug. 21.â Company
F, Second Infantry, is now comfortably
located in its new quarters in the beauti
ful and commodious armory erected by
the Woodland Improvement Association.
Tne structure, which was built particu
larly for the company, is tsvo stories high,
and is divided into a big drillroom, assem
bly-room, banquet-hall and officers' quar
ters. The new armory is thoroughly
equipped, and few companies in the State
enjoy such magnificent quarters as the
local organization. It has caused re
newed interest among the members and
the future of the company is very bright
indeed.
Captain H. U. Prindle is enjoying a fur
lough for forty-five days and Lieutenant
Ward is in command.
Although Second Lieutenant TJtting has
changed his residence to Dixon, he reports
for duty at all drills and meetings of im
portance.
Interest in target practice continues un
abated. Lieutenant Lee of Colonel Guth
rie's staff, D. H. Wyckoff, Lieutenant
Ward and Privates Bounds and Hinck are
doing some splendid shooting at present.
Lieutenant Lee is becoming quite skilled
with his pistol. The company already
has three trophies won at different con
tests, and will be in good trim for future
shoots. .
A ball will be given next week by the
company.
Owing to the absence of the usual appro
priation the company will not go into
camp this summer.
The Naval Battalion.
EUREKA, Cal., Aug. 20.â The Fifth
Division Naval Battalion is all agog.
Lieutenant-Commander Foley has been
officially notified that the Monterey will
be here some time during the first part of
September and will put the young sailor
boys through a course of training. It is
no trouble now to drum up enough men to
man both boats and have some left over.
Every recruit is trying to catch the com
manding officer's eye, and it is a pleasure
to look upon them at their work.
Three times a week Doth boats are out
drilling on the bay. When the trained
sailors of the warship arrive, the battalion
lads say they will show them that they
have not snuffed salt air for a lifetime
without learning something about the art
of managing a boat.
Cockswain Ruiilen haa organized a crew
of six to man the small boat, and when
the Monterey comes will have his lads in
good trim to race the United States life
saving crew team. The Naval Battalion
team consists of Fred Barnum, George
Baliard, George Rolley, W. A. Johnston,
Edward Betterley and Bert Smith. The
land drills are equally well attended. Out
of the seventy men who compri?e the bat
talion, fifty can at any time oe got
together.

LADIES WHO ABE EXPERTS.
Good Scores Made by the Columbia,
Germania and Norddeutscher
Rifle Clubs.
Tbe second day's shoot of the California
Schuetzen Club's annual festival was held
yesterday at Captain Schuemann's shoot
ing range near San Rafael. During the
George M. Barley, One of the Active Members of the Colombia Pistol and
Rifle Club.
early part of the day the attendance was
fair, but the afternoon trains landed
marksmen by the dozens, and until the
targets were rung down at 6:30 o'clock a
perfect sheet of bullets flew across the
range. The light was treacherous and
frequently it became necessary to move
the elevation screws up and down several
points. The wind was steady and strong
from the west and Kept the windgauges
over to the left between two and three
points all day.
With these conditions some very good
and some very bad scores were made, Dut
that is to be expected. Even with a pood
score a marksman sometimes misses a
prize.
Such was the case of D. W. McLaughlin
yesterday and of J. E. Klein the Sunday
previous. White shooting on the point
target Klein ran up the best single score
of the day, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3,3, 2â19, and still
missed a prize on best counters on that
ticket. Yesterday McLaughlin came near
being crowned the "shooting king," but
his name was his hoo-doo. No man with a
"Mac" in his name was ever known to
win kingly honors.
Early in the morning he pulled hard for
the title and the prize that goes with it
and in ten shots made 225. Before the
day was over a son of the Fatherland, Louis
Bendel, snatched the crown from his brow,
so to speak, with a score of 228.
Among the visitors was John Meyer of
Sacramento, who knows when to touch the
hair trigger at the right time. He won a
prize on the honorary target on a score of
24, 25, 21â70, which he might have beat if
he had not been obliged to take the after
noon train for his home.
On the honorary targets, 25 German
ring, there were spirited contests all along
the range. In this event there were sev
enty-five merchandise prises, valued at
$1000, offered, consisting of fine plate and
silverware, a fine target rifle, and jewelry
and all manner of things that gladden the
good marksman's heart.
Among the first to work to the front and
get out of the sixties was D. B. Faktor,
who made 24, 22, 24â70. This caused A. I
Strecker to bet W. Glindemann $10 that he j
(Glindemannl would not beat 70. The lat- i
ter went further and bet a like sum that
he would beat Strecfcer's best, at tbat
time. Glindemann : Â« second ticket showed
up 71. and that lucky Darty tucked a $20 j
piece into his vest pocket. A. H. Pape.
who was nsing smokeless powder, also
made 71 on 24. 24, 23.
Some of the others who made good
scores on these targets were: J. Utschig
Sr 71, H. R. Brown 70. F. P. Schuster 6S,
D W. McLaughiin 70, N. Ahrens 69, D. B.
Faktor 70, C. Meyer 70, L. Bendel 68, N.
Remenperger 64, Ed Ladd 66, A. Jungbiut '
60, R. Stettin 67, A. L. Ott 65, Charles !
Tbierbach 68, J. Straub 59.
No little interest was centered in the
man targets. This target represents the
upper part of a man, and the line down
the middle of the figure in numbered 20.;
The other lines on each side are half an i
inch spart and run to 1.
Lieutenant F. L. Pritchard shot on this j
target for the first time and surprised bis \
frieiids by makine 19, 15, 15, 18â67. The j
real fight lay between Louis Haake and E. j
Baumpartn*>r, who made a dead tie on 18, !
20 19 20 77. There was no time to shoot j
off the tie for the first prize. Among those j
who are sure of winnin > prizes beside !
these two are: D. B. Fak'or-20, 18, 18, \
18â74 â¢J. Utschigâ l9. 18, 18. 20-75; A. H. j

The $5 fee for tickets on the king target
(German 25 ring, ten shots), prevented
many from competing for the honors.
For a time Baum*artner. with 218 rings,
thought he had a chance, but McLaugh- \
lin's score put that in me shade. How
ever, all who shot are sure of winning
casb prizes. The principal scores were:

on the ring, point, honorary, man and

AT SHELL MOUND.
Fine Rifle-Shooters and Military
Marksmen Hold Forth.
Fine rifle sharpshooters and military
marksmen assembled at the Shell Mound
rifle range yesterday in large numbers.
In fact, the targets were kept hot all day.
Considering the many attractions in this
line around the bay, the Columbia Pistol
and Rifle Club's attendance was fairly
good. Not a little interest was centered
1 on the short range, 50 yards, where the
pistol and 22-caliber rifle shooting was
going on. Mrs. L. J. Crane made a very
pretty score on the Columbia target for
! the Glindermann ladies' troDhy. It was 5,
I, 4, 1, 4, 4, 2, 2, 5, 5â33. This shows an
average of 3% points.
Miss Ada M. Olofson also came to the
front with a very pretty practice pistol
score, which for the first effort with this
firearm leads to the belief that she will not
take long in becoming an expert. Her
run was 4, 4, 9, 7, 12. 10, 6, 5, 15, 13â85.
When the ladies' auxiliary to this club is
created there is no doubt but that many
good shots will be developed with rifle and
pistol. The scores on the 50-yard range
were as follows:
Pistol, Blanding medal, three shots, open to
all comeraâ F. O. Young, 3. 3, 3â9; J. E. Gor
man, 6, 2, 2â10: Dr. L. O. Rodgers, 7, 1, 4â12.
Glindernaann ladies' trophy, ten shots, 22
-caliber rifle â Mrs. L. J. Crane, 33.
All-comers' medal, five shots, 22-caliber rifle,
50 yardsâ E. A. Hovey, 9, 12, 13; E. Jacobson,
11, 12; Mrs. L. J. Crane, 11, 16; W. E. Brooks,
24,26.
On the 200-yard rifle range the annexed

lollowing high scores:
First class, H. Huber, 413 rings; third, F.
Rust, 392; iourth, Albert Meyer, 344; best
first shot, Albert Meyer, 24; best last shot,
H. Huber, 25.

; G. Alpers, 5vJB; seventh, F. P. Schuster, 621;
eighth, William F. Garms, 670^.
Among tbe military marksmen consid
erable interest centered around the com
petition for the Foster trophy, the rival
teams under this head being of Companies
1 v\ X, M and I. As the result of a spirited
! contest victory was achieved by Company
1 X, which scored 480 points, or an average
j of 40 lor each ol the twelve men who
I formed tie team.

CRICKET AT GOLDEN GATE.
The Bohemian Team Easily Defeats the
Cleven of Alameda.
Only one Harrison cup cricket match
was played yesterday. It was between
the Bohemian and Alameda clubs and
was played at Golden Gate.
Captain Hood of the Alamedas took the
toss and sent his opponents in. Thanks
chiefly to Moriarty, the ex-Alamedan,
who passed the half-century notch, and to
Captain Robertson, Price and McCrae the
men of scarlet and white amassed the very
respectable total of 138. This proved
more than adequate for the Bohemians'
requirements, for the Alamedas could not
come within half a hundred of it.
The 91 compiled by the latter team was
chiefly contributed to by Bird and Lamb,
"extras' 1 making a good third. Had Rob
ertson not taken himself off and allowed
Bowhill to disport himself with his under
hand wides, the victory would have been
considerably more decisive. Following
are the full scores :

HOW WINTHROP
WAS ARRESTED.
A Messenger Boy With
$100 to Be Given
in Person.
MRS. FELICIA CORNWELL
A Half-Sister to Mrs. Winthrop,
Induces Her to Tell Her
Husband's Whereabouts.
CODY ON A HOT TRAIL.
The Letter and tbe Money Acted as a
Decoy Which Led to the Capture
of the Man in Oakland.
O. W. Winthrop is enjoying whatever
luxuries the County Jail affords its in
mates. Be they good or bad, Winthrop is
pleased with the change from the City
Prison to that of the domicile at the
Broadway hotel. When seen yester
day afternoon in his cell, 36 on the second
floor, he seemed ana spoke in a cheerful
mood.
On the question of his defense he pre
ferred to remain silent, for the reason that
he does not wish Captain Lees, whom he
considers no friend of his, to know the
names or residence of those who will be
called upon when the defense opens to
prove that millionaire Campbell is mis
taken when he says that he was constantly,
or at all, with him at the California-street
cottage.
But on the manner of his arrest in Oak
land by Detective Cody he is not so
silent.
In explaining his version of how Cody
picked him out as Winthrop on the streets
of Oakland, he puts another color of a very
different hue on tL" picture, and if it be cor
rect, it did not rt quire any of the wonder
ful sagacity which goes to make up a great
detective who carries the image of the
criminal in nis mind's eye asleep and
awake.
The manner in which Winthrop was
betrayed is best told in his own language,
and, if he be correct, that arrest was due
to his wife's half sister, Mrs. Corn well, one
of the repudiated widows of "Old Pard,"
the pioneer engineer of the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company, who died a lew
weeks ago.
This relative of his wife's was either the
innocent cause of sending the detective on
his trail, or she was Jed into the scheme
through some influence at present un
known.
But let Winthrop tell the story.
"On Saturday," said he, "bef ire I was
arrested, my wife's half-sister, Mrs. Corn
well, called upon my wife, and with her
came a messenger-boy.
"After a few preliminaries the boy pro
duced $100 in gold twenties, and â  tated to
my wife that that amount had been sent
through him to me, but he would have to
deliver it in person. He could not give it
to a second party.
"My wife hesitated and doubted the
boy, but finally parleyed on the persuasion
of Mrs. Cornwell, knowing that 1 had
some good, kind friends who would like i
to assist me on seeing my name in the
papers as being charged with a serious i
crime, and also knowing that I needed
money.
'â¢At last she weakened and consented to
give the boy my address, writing it on an
envelope and delivering it to him, fully
believing that he would make the use of it
that he said be would. But instead of his
doing so I now nave every reason to believe
it went into the hands of Captain Lees,
who saw that it was mailed and put De
tective Cody on the hot trail, where he lost
no time until he made his wonderful ar
rest, at the instigation of that still more
wonderful man, Lees.
"Now this is the pure and simple story
of bow I was caught.
"The $100, of course, I did not get; it
was used to induce my wife to make
known my whereabouts, which she fool
ishly did. However, it makes little dif
ference, as 1 knew I would have to stand
trial some time after Captain Lees had de
cided to couple me up with tho crime.
"My only object in disguising myself
and remaining away from home was that
I might gather the evidence ol many per
sons in whose company I had been on the
days that they say I was with Campbell
before I would give mysolf up. 1 full well
knew ll Lees caught me he would keep me
in jail, a& he did before, and in that way
prevent me from finding my witnesses.
"One thing that attracted the attention
of one of my boys was while Mrs. Win
throp had gone into an adjoining room
for the writing material the messenger
boy was left alone with one of my boys,
who noticed that the messenger had con- j
cealed the front ol his cap, which gives
his number.
"My boy asked him what nis number
was. This question seemed to somewhat
annoy the messenger, and in an evasive
sort of way he made some response,
which was not clearly understood by his
questioner. But the entry of Mrs. Win
throp prevented the further following up i
of tne inquiry on this subject, so the
matter was dropped, and the following
note, sealed in an envelope and directed to
AL BRONSON.
P. O. Oakland,
A i v tried a Co.,
Was handed the messenger boy, who took
his departure."
The letter, as near as Winthrop can re
member, simply read:
If you need any money send for It; but don't
write to F. or P. Secure letter. Dody.
"Having written to my wife during the
week I naturally expected a letter, and con
sequently on Monday forenoon I went to
the postoffice and asked if there was a let
ter for 'Al Bronson.' The man at the de
livery window shuffled round a good deal
and stepped away from the window, but
returned in a short time, and after search
ing throueh some letters in the B com
partment handed me the letter.
"I then thought there was something
strange in his actions and as a result I
slipped the letter into my pocket and har
ried away from the place. Just as I was
going to the doorway I saw some person
come out of a side door, but did not wait
sufficiently long to take a good look at
him. However, I knew I was trapped
and I hurried off as speedily as I thought
prudent.
"When about half a block away from
the postoflice I heard a footstep behind
me and presently a low-sized man passed
me, almost rubbing up against me and
when he bad gone a few steps in advance
of me he turned rounH suddenly and said :
'What is your name?' I said 'Why do
ask?' 'I'd like to kuow,' he said. 'My
name is Al Bronson,' 1 replied.
"The remainder of the conversation
was just as he tells it, and after a few
more questions he rudely pulled the
glasses from my face and said: 'Your
name is Winthrop and I am a San Fran
cisco detective and I arrest you.' Now
this is the manner in which this wonder
ful arrest was made by one of Captain
Lees' sharp detectives.
"Why, a Chinaman lately imported
from H"ongkong could have arrested me
in Oakland with the tip that bad been
given.
"I am anxious to find Wa-lace Fitz-
Patrick and have him make his where
abouts known to my attorney, Frank V.
Bell, at 420 California street."
THE HANDBALL COURTS.
A Great Game Flayed to Decide the
, : Championship -' of - the ;
Mission. â¢ '
The handball courts were crowded yes
terday and several attractive games
were witnessed. At the San Francisco
court four of the leading players on the
coast met for the first time in many
weeks, John Riordan, the coast cham
pion and J. C. Nealon playing against
P. T. Donnelly, the amateur champion,
and T. F. Bonnet. Bonnet's reappearance
in the alley so gratified the spectators that
they gave him a round of applause. Four
rattling gsmes were played, each side
winning two, and owing to the darkness
the final was postponed till next Sunday.
The event of the day at the Union court
was a match in which J. J. Feeney and
Terry McManus, the heavy-weight cham
pion, played against R. Lenihan, the over
hand swiper, and James Nelson. The dif
ferent aames were marked by great rallies,
whicn aroused the greatest enthusiasm,
and rare judgment on both sides. Feeney
and McManus won the final, after an ex
citing struggle, by four aces.
At the Eureka court, on Eighteenth
street, a match was played to decide the
Mission championship, between Thomas
McLaughlin and J. J. White and Henry Afc-
Graih and Charles Daley. McGrath and
Daley won the final by one ace, after an
exciting game, and challenge any team
for the amateur championship of the coast.

KELLY W AS EASY GAME,
San Francisco Ballplayers Bat
the Imperial Pitcher Out
of the Box.
Male Nine Runs and Nine Safe Hits
With a T-ital of Fourteen Bises
in One Inning.
The San Franciscos and the Imperials
engaged in a ball game at- the Folsom
street grounds yesterday ; and got along
very well together for four innings. After
that the San Franciscos continued the ex
hibition alone â Imperials were not in
it^v â¢ ;; : : / â¢â  â â¢â¢â¢
The occasion of the Imperials dropping
out of the running was the terrible fall
their opponents took out of Pitcher Kelly
in the .fifth/ inning. The \ San Franciscos
reached after his curves with the avidity
evinced by a "cullud gemman" at a water
melon feast. That they found them juicy
is evidenced by the result. Thirteen men
went to the bat, nine of whom hit safely,
five of the nine bits being ' two-baegers.
Nine runs were scored and when the last
out bad beÂ»Â»n effected the Imperial*collec
tively and Pitcher Kelly particularly were
possessed of that tired feeling to a marked
degree. Tho twirler was so tired. that he
was turned out in right garden to- recupe
rate and Joe McCarthy substituted in the j
box. Â . .:';
The run getting is unworthy of descrip
tion, th? San Franciscos scoring more tal
lies in the disastrous fifth inning than the
Imperials laboriously accumulated during
the game. I : .^ '. ' ''' \
Outside the general all-round good work
of the victorious team, the bright particu-
Ur star of the game was John McCarthy,
the new addition to the Imperials. It is a
relief to watch T , the play of the ex-North
west Leaguer, and the acquisition of more
men like him is to be hoped for. '

BEAT A WOMAN SEVERELY.
John Collin* May Have to Answer for
Murder.
Mrs.J3| aggie Crowiey, a woman about 40
years of age, li-s at the point of death in
ncr home, 312 Beale street, the result of a
severe beating she received at the hands
of a man named John Collins, a longshore
man, last Saturday night. Collins had
been drinking heavily during the nay, and
when he went nome in the evening he was
in an ugly mood.
Mrs. Crowiey made some remark and
he threw her on the floor, and as she
alleges beat her unmercifully. Officer E.
F. Ward heard her screams and
hurried to the house and placed Collins
under arrest. A physician was sum
moned and a cursory examination dis
closed the fact that the injured woman's
right hip was fractured in two places.
Mrs. Crowiey is very low and it is feared
that she will not recover. Collins is in
the tanks of the City Prison awaiting the
result of the woman's injuries.

A VICTIM OF A DOCTOR
Mrs. John T. Farreil Said to
Be Dying From Mal
practice.
The Coroner, Police and Receiving
Hospital Physicians Called
Into the Case-
Shortly after midnight word was re
ceived by Coroner Hawkins that a woman
living at 20 Henry street was dying from
the effects of a criminal operation com
mitted three weeks ago.
The message was sent by Dr. Farnum,
who bad been called into the case.
The victim is Mrs. Farreil, the wife of
John T. Farreil, a carpet layer.
According to the story she told she vis
ited Dr. McÃeth of Sutter street and Grant
avenue, and last Monday she became very
ill. Her condition became worse, until
Dr. Farnum was called in.
He wanted to consult with the Coroner,
but the latter decided tbat it was not wise
for him to have anything to do with a
case that might come before him for of
ficial investigation.
Dr. Fitzgibbon of the Receiving Hospi
tal responded to the call, however.
By the time he arrived the police had
been notified that there was the element
of criminality in the case, and Lieutenant
Burke and Sergeant Monahan repaired to
the house to investigate.
The woman's chances of recovery are
sain to be very doubtful.
STABBED IN THE NECK
A Highbinder Assaults a Man in a
Crowd and Escapes.
A hard-looking Chinaman named Soh
Dah, whose friends declare he is a laborer,
had a narrow escape from death while
watching the celebration in Baker alley,
which has been in progress in Chinatown
all week.
Some one, whom the crowd of Celes
tials gathered about claim to be unable
to identify, rushed up behind Soh
Dah and thrust a dagger in the right side
of his neck. The wounded man fell like
dead and he was hastily conveyed to tlie
Receiving Hospital. His injury, however,
consisted of a rather severe flesh wonnd,
the weapon having just missed the jugu
lar.
ifoh Dah is a member of the iio^jr Chow
Company. He disclaims any knowledge
of his assailant.

Pure
Gratitude.
WHEN A MAN WRITES TO US AND
* " makes a statement for the benefit of
his fallow sufferers and does it ( out of
pure gratitude, you can make up your
mind that his statement means some-
thing. It means that he has been greatly
benefited, that he is pleased with the re-
sults in his case, that he considers that he
has received more than the worth of his
money. Then what is money compared
with health? You who are weak or ailing
would give a great deal for a ; remedy that
you know would strengthen and tone up
your system and restore ' ; you to health.
Such a remedy is
DR. sanden's
electric" belt.
It infuses new life and tone into the
weakened nerves and vital organs and
sets the whole system into active vigorous
life. . Yon apply it at night when you go
to bed and you are induced into a sound,
refreshing sleep by its mild, soothing cur-
rent, as yon feel it absorbing into the
nerves. Thousands of people on the coast
can testify to its efficiency. See what Mr.
Johnson 'of.Huexieme says after wearing
it four. months. A remedy that a whole
family can use with good results certainly
possesses merit worthy of mention. Â,.
DR. A. T. SAKDEXâ Dear Sir: I write the fol-
lowing . out of ! pure gratitude. I got hurt
last November by a heavy warehouse door lull-
ing on my head and injuring my back and
kidneys. 1 was under, the doctor's care !or
nearly six weeks, but found very little relief.
When I got your belt 1 was not able to work.
1 could not benr to have anything touch my
back without great pain. 1 began to improve
as soon as I started your treatment, and now,
after four months use, lam a wellmau. My
wife has been under the doctor's care for
years. She wore the belt for a month and is
doing nicely under the treatment and has not
had occasion to visit a doctor since. My sister-
in-law, Mrs. E. J. Bighnm, of Woodyille. Tular*
County, came to pay my -vife a visit and while
here she became so ill that she was hardly able
to sit up. I got her to try the belt, and she has
been helped very much.- That s is the reason
that I sent for a belt for her. lam willing to
verify this statement and hope it will be the
means of helping others. Yours gratefully,

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION
and PROSPERITY.
FOR PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM HcKINLEY, or Ohio
FOB TICF-PRBBIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
Mc&inley's speeches are not long but
they reach every interest of the country.
The free coinaee of silver can be effected
beneficially to this country, but not by
fiasco statesmen.
Every day records a new bolt from the
Democratic party, and every bolter en
courages others to follow him.
Even with free coinage no one can get
silver without work, and there will never
be abundant work in this country under
Democratic free trade.
Banker St. John of New York says his
name is pronounced Sinjun, in the hope
probably that the people will rhyme it
with ''honest Injun," but they won't.
If there were no other issue at stake
than the simple one of choosing men to
conduct the Government the people wouid
down the fiasco party and elect McKinley
by a rousing majority.
Business men are averse to any more
economic experiments for a time at least,
and it ia everywhere recognized that the
free coinage of silver in the hands of Dem
ocratic bunglers would be an experiment
of the most hazardous kind.
An attempt of the Democrats to fool the
people into the belief that the tariff is not
an issue in the campaign has not met with
much success in the East, for the demand
of the voters for protection literature is
said to exceed that of any other cam
paign in the history of the country.
Under wise and conservative guidance
free silver can be restored in this country
without injury to any industry, but to
have that guidance we must elect states
men and not demagogues; we must in
trust the Government to men who can
govern and no: to a set of bunglers, wran
glers and faction fighters.
Bryan's New York speech contains
13,000 words, and yet it never made half as
much impression upon the country as
that short address in which McKinley
said: "It is a good deal better to open up
tbe mills of tbe United States to the labor
of Americans than to open up the mints
to the silver of the world."
General Daniel E. Sickles, one of the few
neroes of the war who honored the Demo
cratic party by their support, has broken
from it now and has called upon his fel
low-vete~anB in the party ranks to come
out and stand np for their comrade Mc-
Kinley in opposition to the platform ot
repudiation and the candidate of agra
nanism.
The more the situation is studied by in
telligent birnetallists the more thoroughly
do they become convinced that Senator
Wolcott was right in saying: "Silver will
again be restored to its place as a money
metal at the old ratio, and when this res
toration comes it will be accomplished
through the action and efforts of the Re
publican party."
In describing his voyage in the polar re
gionÂ« ITr. Nansen said he lighted his ship
by electricity generated by windmill
power, and now it is pertinent to ask
whether there isn't science enough in this
country to transmute the blowing of the
Democratic windmills into something that
will throw light upon what they expect to
do for the business interests of the people.
Every day the quiet home of McKinley
ia the little to*rn of Canton is visited by
throngs of veterans of the war, working
men of the great industries, farmers, busi
ness men and good citizens of all classes,
who call to pledge him their support,
because they recognize in him the cham
pion of protection, the promoter of pros
perity, and in this issue the defender of
National honor and integrity.
Harold M. Bewali, sen of old man Sew
â¢ll of the Chicago ticket, recently made a
speech, in which he said : "I shall attack
the Chicago platform in every line and
letter. I know it and we know ie to be
absolutely opposed to Democratic tradi
tions and adverse to the principles on
which this Government must live." It
is for stalwart Democrats to decide
whether it would not be better to vote for
Watson than for the father of a son like
that.
In opening tbe Ohio campaign at Co
lumbua Senator Foraker accurately de
fined the Republican position on the
money issue in saying: "What we want is
the double or bimetallic standard, under
which we Can have not only the free coin
age of both metals but tbe actual use of
both metals as we now have, with the ad
ditional use of silver for redemption pur
poses. We propose to secure this by in
ternational agreementâ tbe only possible
way, in our judgment, that has yet been
coin ted out.' 1
THE CAMPAIGN OPENED.
The formal opening of the Republican
campaign at the Auditorium Saturday
night was a great success in point of num
bers, enthusiasm and logical presentation
of the issues. It is unfortunate that the
accommodations of the hall were not
equal to more than 25 per cent of the
crowd, but even though so many had no
opportunity to participate in "firing the
first gun," the fact tbat there was such a
general outpouring of the rank and file
shows how deeply interested the people are
in the election of Major McKinley, and in
the triumph of Republican principles in
the local as well as hi the National strug
gle for supremacy.
A striking feature of the gathering was
the great number of thoughtful business
men and wave-earners, nor could one help
being impressed with their earnestness and
enthusiasmâ enthusiasm of the kind that
comes oi a full understanding and appre
ciation of the importance of victory. The
speakers were quicK to catch the spirit
which brought bo many thousand people
together, and their analysis of the eco
norric problems which now confront the
country was made in soberness and in ear
nestness. It was "Come, let cs reason
together" about the public concerns of tbe
people and the good of the material inter
ests of the country. There was plenty of
tbe enthusiasm of determination, and
every one left the hall deeply impressed
with the dangers that threaten home,
industry and commerce in the purpose of
the advocates of free trade, unsound
money and social revolution.
While there is really no cause for alarm,
the people are becoming alarmed at the
aggressiveness of Altgeldism, and the
sentiment is so wide-spread that it be
hooves every lover of our institutions to
become an active participant in the work
of uprooting seeds of sectionalism and sav
inc the country from the reign of an un
learned and visionary experimentalist.
There would be cause for uneasiness at
the threats of the Bryanites to overturn
our system of government were the
country not assured by such gatherings of
the people as the one at the Auditorium
Saturday night that the people know what
Bryan's election would mean, and are re
solved that no such departure from the
fundamental principles of the Government
shall be made.
When the interior towns and neighbor
hoods read about the Auditorinm meet
ing they should be stimulated to greater
activity than ever in the work of organ
izing McKinley clubs. The Republicans
of San Francisco will set the pace, but
close, thorough and enthusiastic organ
izations throughout ' the State arj
absolutely necessary to the kind of a
victory that would set at rest for years to
come, at least, any doubt as to how Cali
fornia stands on the question of prosperity
and protection for America.
CALLED UPON M'KINLEY.
It is no small undertaking for 2000 peo
ple to charter a train and go to a neigh
boring State to do honor to a candidate
for a public office, and when 2000 Penn
sylvanians journeyed to Canton, Ohio, to
assure Major McKinley that the farmers
and wage-earners of the great industrial
State of Pennsylvania were his. political
friends they must have felt that tbe
country was facing a crisis, and that it
was the duty of all patriotic people to
assure their leader in the great cause of
prosperity that they were rallying to his
support.
These travelers from Pennsylvania to
Ohio were not moved by curiosity. It
cannot be said of them that they merely
wanted to see the man McKinley. They
were moved by lofty and sincere patriot
ism, and they went to Canton for
no purpose other than to empha
size their devotion to Americanism.
It may be that there was a thread
of selfishness running through their
hearts and minds, but if the threads were
followed to their beginning it would be
found that the Pennsylvanians â farmers
and wage-earners â felt that if Bryan were
elected the one would have to face open
competition with the pauper farm labor
of Europe and South America and the
other would have to face indefinite idle
ness. Such selfishness is to be com
mended in every American citizen.
In reply to the delegation Major Mc-
Kinley said, among other ''things, that
"the thought of the people this year 13 di
rected to the present condition of the
country and how best to improve it. This is
the thought of every mind and tbe prayer
of every soul. Nobody is satisfied with our
unfortunate business condition and the
great body of the people want and mean to
have a change. What shall the change be?
Shall it be the continuance of the present
Democratic party under another leader
ship â a leadership advocating all the pol
icies of the Democratic party which have
been injurious to the American people and
rejecting all which are good, wholesome
and patriotic and which have received the
approval of the people of the country?
The wing of the Democratic party which
controlled the Chicago convention is jast
as much in favor of free trade as the win?
of the Democratic party in control of the
National administration."
THE SPOILS OF OFFICE.
It is very easy to understand why the
professional politician â the man who is
"in politic 3 for revenue only" â is shont
ing for Bryan. The Chicago platform de
nounces the civil service law as a scheme
to deprive workers of the spoils of office,
while the Republican party is pledged to
extend the civil service list wherever prac
ticable. Tbe Republican party placed the
civil service law on the statute-book, and
it has had Cleveland's hearty support. The
necessity for making intellectual and moral
worth the essential qualification for ap
pointment to government office was never
questioned by either of the great parties
until the Democracy declared in its con
vention at Chicago that the patronage of
the Government should be disposed of
with reference to the faithfulness of work
ers for the party's success during tbe cam
paign.
Mr. Bryan is a firm believer in the spoils
system, and if he is elected campaign debts
will be paid in public offices without refer
ence to the fitness of the appointee. It is
for this reason that Tammany and Tam
many'skind of political bosses in tbelaree
cities are working for Bryan's election. It
is hard to understand how a man of Bry
an's character could be so carried away by
ambition to be President as to make mer
chandise of tbe President's appointing
power, but his platform declares for the
reinstatement of the spoils system, and he
indorses the declaration.
If the Republican party cannot win
without stooping to such a disgraceful
method to catch votes it certainly will
not win. The Republican party does not
believe that the operation of the ma
chinery of the Government should be
given into the hands of toughs and bum
mers, nor will it entertain any proposal
for anything of the kind. All things
being equal, those who did the most to se
cure the downfall of the Democracy will
be the first on the list for appointment,
but unless the applicant is weil qualified J

and is a man of integrity his work during
the campaign will avail him little. The
Republican party believes the Govern
ment should avoid placing its manage
ment in the hands of men who look upon
a public office as pay for party work
rather than a public trust. The Republi
can party is a deadly foe to Bryan's spoils
system. ___________ ___
A BRYAN DISCOVERY.
For once a great economic truth has
penetrated the mind of Mr. Bryan. He
says: "If the cost of producing gold
should be reduced 90 per cent without
any increase in the output, the purchasing
power of an ounce of gold would not fall."
What Mr. Bryan says the world has
Known always, but it ia none the less true
because it has only just now reached Mr.
Bryan's understanding. The presump
tion has been in all ages of the world that
it was the quantity of the precious metals
produced and not the cost of their produc
tion that fixed their status as money
metals. It is of no consequence what it
costs to deliver gold to the gold market,
nor is it of any consequence what it costs
to deliver silver to the silver market. It
is what can be obtained in the market for
them that fixes their purchasing power.
And, again, the cost of producing the
metals is not alike in any two mines, nor
does the buyer of them in tne market care
what the cost to market them is. It is
their value as a commodity that he deals
with.
It is the fact, too, that if the cost of pro
ducing the metals exerted any influence
whatever in determining their market
value there would be about as many prices
for gold and silver as there are gold and
silver mines. The purchasing power of
anything is regulated by the supply of it
and the demand for it. The principle which
commerce adopts in determining what it
shall use for redemption money is that
that which it adopts shall be limited in
quantity and for which tne demand shall
be unlimited. That Is the very essence of
the philosophy and science of money. The
metal or metals which commerce adopts
for redemption money is as much an
article of Darter, either in bullion or coin,
as potatoes, but for convenience com
merce makes certain bullion or coin a
common article of barter â that is, it is re
ceived that article in exchange for every
other article -but unless commerce sanc
tions the use of an article as a common
article of barter it is deprived of univer
sality of exchange value.
The Republican party does not under
take to equalize the coat of producing
either gold or silver, but inasmuch as com
merce has outgrown the old volume of
gold money and is in need of a large in
crease of redemption money, the party
proposes to have commerce make silver
dollars a common article of exchange with
all the redemption power that gold has.
The Republican party believes that the
volume of redemption money should be en
larged in an amount equal to the produc
tion of silver, but it does not think it wise
to undertake it independent of commerce,
oecause commerce is supreme in authority
when it comes to saying what snail cousti
tute redemption money. Tnat the Repub
lican party will have silver added to the
world's money metal there is no doubt,
but it will secure the co-operation and con
sent of commeice before the final decree
goes forth.
COAST EXCHANGES.
The newest addition to the list of Califor
nia newspapers is the Sisson Mirror, pub
lished by Rogers & Wolcott. The paper Js cer
tainly deserving of support, as It makes an
excellent advertisement for Sisson and the
country around it. Politically the Mirror will
be independent, and will reflect events and
ideas with fidelity to truth and reality. Sis
con is a progressive town, and a newspaper
should prosper there.
The Monmouth (Oregon) Monitor last week
gave up the ghost after a struggle of about six
months. The advertising columns of the paper
were ihy patronized. Nevertheless, the editor
was perfectly willing to work for glory, but he
couldn't live altogether on a diet of glory.
Hence he has closed his newspaper office, and
will seek another road to fame and fortune.
The Lemoore Radical has commenced Its
third volume. It is an "independent advocate
of genuine Democracy," and is published semi
monthly at 25 cents a year. It hangs a ban
ner with the name of Bryan on It over its edi
torial column, but Mr. Sewall isn't mentioned,
and Mr. Watson, too, is treated as if he were
not a figure in the campaign.
L. A. Elchler has purchased an interest in
the Williams Transcript, which will hereafter
be run uuder a copartnership arrangement be
tween Mr. Eichler an! the recent sole propri
etor, J. L. Kwinan.
From the Ferndale Enterprise It Is learned
that surveyors have found an e*sy grade for
the proposed Trinity road and that it can be
built at a cost not to exceed $300 per mile.
The Enterprise says: "It is the intention of
the Toll Road Company, which has been or
ganized, to get a fifty-year franchise trom
Trinity County, sell the shares of stock in the
company for $1 per share, payable In monthly
installments of 10 cents per snare, and as
soon as money enough has been paid in to
justify, to commence to build the load. The
company can get all the men it wants, who
will take one-half money and one-half stock,
for working, and has received the same
proposition for team work."
The example of the San Joaquin Valley
farmers in making shipments of freight from
one town to another in days before a com
peting railroad line forced down the freight
tariffs, is being imitated by a man in the
southern part of the State. The Los Angeles
Express tells about it. thus: "Arthur Scott, a
wealthy Antelope Valley rancher, has Inaug
urated a freight line between Fairmoun* and
this city for the purpose of hauling wheat
south and merchandise north. He claims
that he can mane a round trip in ten days,
and do the work much cheaper than the rail*
road. A business man In Los Angeles Informs
the Express that Mr. Scott is meeting with
goodsuccesB in his new venture. It Is also
stated that the BouihÂ£rn Pacific, in order to
compete with Mr. Scott, has reduced the rates
on hauling wheat from Lancaster to this city
from $4 per ton to $2 15."
A GOOD PLAN IN CALIFORNIA.
New York Evening Sun.
In the advertisement department of some of
the best-known periodicals this season appears
the prospectus of a certain summer resort,
which concludes its list of attractions with the
words, "Special Rates to Young Men." The
words are In good, big type, by far the most
striking thing about the advertisement. The
summer resort that welcomes young men is
sure to have the opportunity of likewise wel
coming young womenâ droves of them. It's a
good rule that works both ways, and so insures
patronÃge. ___^
GOOD FOR ENGLAND.
American Economist.
Labor in England has been faring better dur
ing our free-trade era than under American
protection. Even so late as June 40,000 Brit
ish wage-earners received increases, while only
3000 hands sustained decrease* of wages. The
average increase in the wages of the total
number affected was 28 cents per week. Here
we have been recording nothing but decreases
in wages or no wages through closed mills.
A Cosmopolitan City.
Yreka Journal.
San Francisco is tbe most cosmopolitan city
hi the world. The holidays of every nation
are commemorated by public parades. Every
ciTilized language may be heard, ana the
ships of every maritime nation from the Brit

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
It is given out that the extensive cattle In
terests of Nevada are in better ghape, and on a
more profitable basis than for a long time.
There have teen no deep snows or fierce blii
zards in recent years to carry away the live
stock. But there ha* been enough snow to in
sure plenty of fine grass.
Cattle are now in excellent condition there,
and the hay crop, both wild and of alfalfa, is
heavy.
J. S. Hill, an extensive alfalfa grower of
lovelock, 90 miles east of Reno, is at the Russ.
He gets the water necessary to irrigate his
ranch from the Humboldt River.
"I believe I have not for years seen the live
stock interests in better shape," he said yes-

terday. "Cattle are fat and hay is plenty. The
wild hay consists of a sort of redtop which
grows in the bottoms, and of bluejoint which
grows on the hills.
"On my ranch I raise alfalfa only, and get
from two to three crops a year.
"I met a leading livestock-grower from Gol
conda to-day, and he told me that in that part
of Nevada slock were in fine shape. They have
put up a lot of hay, but mostly for winter in
surance, that is, as emergency against long
continued storms.
"A great many steers have been shipped out
of the State recently, and as a whole I think
the supply is decreasing. Cattle are worth
about 5 cents a pound there, or a little nnder.
Alfalfa hay is worth about $4 a ton in the
stack.
"Quite a number of new ranches are being
opened in my neighborhood. The proprietors
get the water to irrigate them from the Hum
boldt. They have laid out several new
canals lately."
Rev. P. Wright nnd wife and D. H. Wright of
Ponage La Prairie, Manitoba, are at the
Grand on their way home after spending three
months at San Diego, where the younger Mr.
Wrigtit went In quest of health and whither
he proposes to return and locate.
"Portage," said the large, robust, genial
looking clergyman, who is pastor of a Presby
terian church at home, "is a town of about
5000 inhabitants. It is fifty-six miles from
Winnipeg and is in the very heart of a great
wheat country. Last year about 60,000,000
bushels of grain were shipped out of Manitoba.
The crop this year will not be so large,
although it is by no means a poor yieldâ an
average, I think, of twenty bushels to the
acre. One thing I can say definitely is that
there is not vow in Canada any desire for
union with the United States. There was a
stronp sentiment ten or fifteen years ago, but
it has given way to a general desire for closer
and more friendly commercial relations only.
At Portage we have about 200 refuge Sioux
from the United States. We have gathered
their children into school and are educating
them. All the Indian schools in the Dominion
are maintained by the different churches, but
while good work is being done I do not think
the system is generally so good as that main
tained by the Government of this country. In
time Canada is sure to come to Indian schools
conducted by the Government."
On March 3 when the younger Mr. Wright
left his wheat ranch near Portage he says the
weather was delightful. The next day, how
ever, a severe blizzard struck the place. The
winters, he declares, are "corkers," with ihe
temperature 35 and 40 degrees below zero.
That is why he is now so loud in his praises
of the climate of San Diego, a place
which he predicts will some day be
a great sanitarium, its commerce de
veloped from the date of the first Japanese
steamship line and its surrounding country
made green and productive by the use of great
water supplies awaiting capital to convert
them Into reservoirs lor extensive irrigating
systems. .___________Â»____Â» -

SOUND MONEY AND A BAD TARIFF
New York Press.
It has always seemed to some thoughtful
people that the almost simultaneous discovery
of gold in California and the operation of the
Walker tariff constituted the most curiously
savage joke that fate ever played upon
a country. The tariff was passed in
184(j. Two years later, the discovery
having been made, the annual gold
production leaped from $1,000,000 to
$10,000,000; then, with an astounding
bound to $40,000,000; then to $50,000,
-000, and in no year thereafter, while the
Walker tariff and its destructive amend
ment of 1857 kept its deadly parallel, fell be
low that annual amount. But, whatever pace
the miners struck, the importers were even
with them. In some years they tallied almost
to the dollar.
Thus, in 1855, the gold product was $55,
-000,000. The exportation of domestic gold
that year to pay for foreign imports was
$53,957,418. It haa to be Helped â¢ut with
$2,289,925 foreign gold, and then it left us in
debt. For the adverse balance of tradeâ a tre
mendous amount for those days of small
things, with less than half our present popu
lationâwas $65,000,000. Again, in tne panic
year of 1857, when tbe second reduction of
tariff schedules was made, we dug $55,000,
-000 out of the ground and sent abroad
$60,078,352 of domestic gold. It will be seen
that $5,000,000 had to bo borrowed from
left-over stocks of one good year where
the exports had been only $44,000,000
and the product $55,000,000. At the end
of tbe first ten years, the Crimean war and tbe
failure oJ foreign crops, Irish especially, hav
ing helped us to pay in produce a little of our
debt of $485,977,291, ten years' adverse bal
ance, we had exported $340 814,274 of the less
than $500,000,000 in gold which we had dug.
In consequence of this drain we (suspended
specie payments almost as soon as the war be
gan. Tne work for the Confederacy which Sec
retary Floyd did in shipping munitions of war
South for a few months oefore the war began
was a trifle, a nothing, compared to tbe worK
which Secretary Walker's tariff did in shipping
gold abroad for years before the war began.
But we would not dwell so much upon the
condition of the Government, which was noto
riously bankrupted by the Walker tariff, as
upon the condition of the people who were
helped not one whit oy this enormous find,
this windfall, of money, which, owing to bad
tariff laws, they could not turn into wealth.
That ior which they paid their gold they wore
out on their backs and used up in their houses.
No capital came to them in return for their
money. Wages remained at their old rnte.
Few great public works were undertaken. The
era of transcontinental railway building was
postponed ior a decade, and the conquest of
the continent so languidly pushed that in the
second year of the war the' Government had to
withdraw troops from the South to battle with
Indians for the mastery of Minnesota.
And after this yellow torrent had swept
over it for ten years, the per capita Circulation
of the country â mostly in depreciated State
bank billsâ was $14 OtJ. It is $21.65 at pres
ent.
There should be no difficulty in applying
this one of the lessons whicn this Democracy
has learned by experience. If the silver, with
which the mine-owners of the Rockies propose
to flood this country through the mints were
gold, or if it had the coinage value of which
they say it has been deprived, if we reai.y
should have more moneyâ which we should
not, but less through the depreciation of that
which wo now have and the expulsion of gold
âthrough placing a lying mint mark upon
their product, it would advantage us not one
whit until the Wilson tariff was revised.

Investigate Thoroughly.
Stockton Independent
When a farmer or any other business man
contemplates any new venture he gathers all
the facts and figures he can on the subject and
from these facts and figures he calculates.
The result of the calculation decides the ques
tion of going into tbe venture or abandouing
it. In politics, however, men are too apt to
let the politicians make their calculations and
to accept them without scrutiny. That is what
the free-silver men are doing in the present
campaign. Those who put the sliver question
to a business test find that the figures find
facts are against the change of basis if they
take every factor into considerations.
A FITTED WAIST.
The perfecily plain fitted waist always has
many devotees. The one shown bsre is
fastened Invisibly at the shoulder and under
arm seams, though it may be made to button
in front or lace in the back, tbe waist being
out with the usual back, side-body and under
arm forms, and having four darts in front.
A striking waist was of dark silk with white
lace on the body, as shown above. The sleeves
were of preen silk in two tone*.
Cheviots make up well after this model with
a trimming of braiding. One of blue, brown,
red and white had a design in brown braid ;
various shapes in elaborate designs come al
ready prepared to sew on, such as yokes, col
lars, epaulets, girdles, etc., and make it possi
ble to trim a aress very handsomely with good
effect, the designs being equally as stylish as
those braided on the fabrlr.
A waist oi emboidered batiste over blue silk
had sleeves of blue novelty silk, of which the
skirt was also made.
A brown cloth waut had a braid jacket
effeot in brown soutache edged with gilt. The
sleeves were of novelty silk. The skirt was of
the cloth.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Jean Bartâ E. L. H., Belmont, Cal. It is
said tbat the most comprehensive and fullest
work, and therefore the best work, on Jean
Bart, Forbln and Duguajr-Trouin, is "La Vie
de Jean Bart," by Richer, a French author. Of
this Eugene Sue ouce said, "If the anecdotes
narrated by Richer are not true they ought to
be."
Cttster's Widowâ S., Santa Barbara, Cal. Not
withstanding the fact that the biographies of
General Custer do not mention that he was a
married man, he did leave a widow. He was
married in 1864 In Missouri. Mrs. Custer wrote
a book called "Boots and Baddle," in which
â he described life on the plains and in the
West.
Colleges and Universitiesâ E. L. H., Bel
mont, Cal. As to the universities for men, Har
vard and Yale in the United States are in tha
front rank, and these are about the most diffi
cult to enter on account of the rigid examina
tion that applicants for admission have to un
dergo. As to colleges for women, it is asserted
that Vassar and Wellesley are in the front
rank.
School Districtâ P., Philo, Cal. A school
district in this State has no right to incur any
liability during one school year with the ex
pectation of paying it with the next year's ap
propriation. Section 18 of article XI of the
constitution of this 1 State says: "No county,
city, town, board of education or school dis
trict shall iucur any indebtedness or liability
in any manner or for any purpose exceeding
in any year the income and revenae provided
for it for such year, without the assent of two
thirds ot tbe qualified electors thereof." This
provision of the constitution has been con
strued by the Supreme Court to apply io any
indebtedness which officers mignt have the
discretion to incur, and not to indebtedness
created by legislative enactment.
Territoriesâ F. J. 8., City. The Territories
of the United States are Alaska, Arizona, In
dian, New Mexico and Oklahoma. The unor
ganized Territories are under the direct oon
trol of Congress, while each organized Terri
tory has a Governor appointed by the Presi
dent for four years, and ratified by the Senate.
Ench organiiod Territory has a Legislature
officially known as the Legislative Assembly,
and is composed of a Council and a House of
Representatives chosen every two years by the
people. A Delegate to Congress is elected for
the same term. He has the nght'of debate,
but not a vote in the House. Territorial legis
lation is subject to Congressional contest.
Territorial courts are provided for, the Judges
of which are appointed by the President for
four years, and confirmed by the Senate, and
over which the Supreme Court has appellate
jurisdiction. The 'lerritories have no voice in
Presidential electiou*. At this time all the
Territories are organised except Alaska and
Indian Territory. Alaska has been organized
as a District, and has executive officers ap
pointed by the President, but is without repre
sentative institutioua.

Alviso Sunday Excursionists Visit the
C ty Without Paying Railroad
Fares.
A cool, cloudy day on the bay is not a
favorable time for water excursions and
picnics, consequently the outing affairs
were sparsely attended yesterday. There
were none of the usual Sunday crowds
around the ferry-gates and along the
wharves.
The little steamer Alviso was an excep
tion to the frost that fell on the bay excur
sions yesterday. She came up from the
town whose name she bears loaded down
with visitors to San Francisco. Tney
lanaed at Washington-street wharf early
in the forenoon and were enabled to visit
the park, Cliff House and other points of
interest around the City and board the
boat for their return in the afternoon.
A band of music entertained the com
pany, ana all enjoyed the trip under the
protection and care of Captain Hideout.
That is a new and pleasant way for coun
try people to visit the metropolis without
paying railroad fares.
E. Stratbopulos and John Catecht, pro
prietors of the Union restaurant at 325
East street, spent Sunday commentine on
the unfavorable aspect of the whaling in
dustry. He has been supplying meals to
the boats' crews that have been parading
around the streets for the last two weeks
showing the public how the leviathan of
the deep is caught.
There is $53 due him and he is wonder
ing from what place the payment will
come. Landlord Strathopulos, who is a
native ot the land of Pi ato, states in his
classical Grecian way that somebody wiil
suffer if those fifty -eight pieces of silver
find not his pocket. A police sergeant
who always has advice for a friend in
nesd has counseled tne restaurant man to
attech the whale after it is narpooncd.
Chief Officer Wilson of the steamer
Portland, which got in from the north
Saturday nieht, has a dog which deserts
the ship every chance he gets.
The animal has been lied up, locked up,
but heretofore be has succeeded in some
manner in leaving the ship at every port.
The dog is a valuable deerhound and when
it turns up missing Officer W'iison drops
everything to go ashore and find his
hound. He has at last found a way to
keep that canine on board ship. The ani
mal is mortally afraid of the steam- â¢
whisile, and so with several fathoms of
small rope bis master ties him to the terri
ble screeching thing. When he begins to
pull on the line the loud, sputtering
sound almost frightens him to death.
That settles the dog, who has learned
that when he crouches down under the
rail the whistle is silent. Even when
there is no steam on to terrorize him he
does not dare to pull on his line, and the
new system of training dogs by steam is a
success.
The body of Charles McCallum. first of
ficer of the steamer Gypsy, who fell over
board from the gangpiant of that vessel
at Broadway wharf on the night ot August
17, was recovered from the bay yesterday.
The steamer Queen, Captain Carroll,
left Broadway wnarf at 10 o'clock with
about 300 excursionists on board and
steered for the open sea on a whaling
cruise. It had been announced that a
number of whales had been seen in the
vicinity of Pigeon Point and it was to cap
ture some of these that crews of whalers
were sent down on the Queen. There
were two crews on board armed with
bomb lances, harpoons and all the appli
ances that the modern whale-catchers use
and they also had two whaleboats of the
most approved pattern.
The steamer had reasonably clear
weather and a smooch sea, and steamed
to a point from which the excursionists
had a good view of the steamer Colombia
as she is on the rocks. Then she started
for the fishing ground, ten miles to the
north. The crews that were to man the
whaleboats were on the lookout, and to
hear them talk the excursionists became
impressed with the idea that there would
be a whale for every excursionist.
Suddenly the man on the lookout yelled
at the top of his voice, "There she blow?,"
and instantly all was commotion. Every
thing was made ready to lower the boats,
but before this was done 'the steamer ap
proached within a few hunared yards of a
school of a dozen or more whales lazily
basking in the sunshine that forced its
way between the clouds. When all was
ready the boats were lowered with the
valiant crews and the guns and the wind
lasses and harpoons ar.d axes all ready for
the war of extermination on the floating
masses of blubber.
The boats started, one shot ahead of the
others, and tne boatsteerer went forward,
stood in the bow, ready with his gun
to fire when the boat reached a distance
that would give him certainty of aim. Be
hind him stood one of the men with har
poon poised. The boat advanced, rubbed
up against one, and the man with the gun
stood; so did the man with the harpoon.
The excursionists all anxiously awaited
the report that would announce that a
fatal charge had been rir-d into the levia
than of the deep, but, like the letter that
was looked for, it came not.
Then the excursionists wondered if they
had paid their money to see a whale hunt
or & tableau, and concluded it was a
tableau only. The whale evidently be
came diszuBted, for after scraping off a few
barnacles by rubbing aeainst the boat be
winked his other eye at the crew,
took a header and wen: down to the bot
tom of the sea.
The crews of the other boats did no bet
ter, and at 6 o'clock the crews were called
back and taken on board.
The men explained that, ai there was
no wind they could not sail ahead of the
whales, and not being able to face them
were unable to act.
AtlOo'clock the Queen returned with
300 dissatisfied and disgusted excursion
ists.

Brigadier-General Keppel of the Salvation
Army addressed a meeting at the Y. M. C. A.
building yesterday afternoon. He took for his
theme "Repentance," and as an illustration
related his own experience in religious life.
He was brought up In Dublin, Ireland, all
his early Christian training having been in
the Episcopal church; but, while be was tilled
with religious teaching, he was not religious.
One day he dropped into a little Methodist
church, and there for the first time he felt the
spirit of the religion he has since aimed to
live up to and teach. Formerly he was em

tense earnestness, the cornerstone of the
new St. Paul's Church, on California
I street, near Fillmore, was laid yesterday.
Risht Reverend William Ford Nichols,
D.D., Bishop of California, conducted the
exercises, assisted by the following local
clergy: Dr. Kelley, City missions; Rev.
M. D. Wilson, rector of St. Peter's; Rev.
H. Chetwood, editor Churchman; Rev.
G. E. Walk, rector Trinity; Rev. W. M.
Reilly, rector Bt. Panl's; Rev. E. J. Lion,
rector SU Stephen's; Rev. R. C. Foute,
rector Grace Church; Rev. W. H. More
land, rector St. Luke's; Rev. W. C. Shaw,
assistant rector St. Luke's, and Dr. D.
McClure.
In spite of the keen, biting wind and
heavy fog, an immense throng gathered
about the front 01 the new church when
the principal exercises occurred. A few
moments after the appointed hour, 3
I o'clock, the choir, sixteen strong, headed
j by eight little boys becomingly attired in
I white, marched through the half finished
I building to the sidewalk, where a double
line was formed. Then came the pastor.
Rev. Mr. Reilly, and then the visiting
clergy two abreast, the Bishop bringing
up the rear. During this solemn march
the choir sang the processional hymn.
Bishop Nichols then gave voice to a
short, fervent prayer, after which, laying
his hand on the cornerstone, went through
lixe usual exercises, the congregation re
sponding. The reading of the list of the
several articles placed in the cornerstone
followed. There were these articles:
A view of the new church, an interior view
of the old church, a set of United States silver
coins, phoiograph of Bishop Nichols, photo

The Bishop read the following, after
which an adjournment was taken to tha
church, where the exercises were con
cluded with souk and prayer and a few
appropriate remarks by Bishop Nichols,
Rev. Mr. Lion and the pastor:
The glorious majesiy of the Lord our God be
upon us; prosper thou the work of our hands
upon us, O prosper thou our handiwork.
Except the Lord build the house, their labor is
but vain that build it.
In the faith of Jesus Christ we place this
foundation stone (striking It three times
with a hammer), in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
amen, of to be dedicated to the worship
and service ot almighty God, the Father,
the Son aud the Hoi/ Ghost; for reid
iue and preaching his holy word, for cele
brating his holy sacraments, for offering to his
glorious Majesty the sacrifice of prayer, praise
and thanksgiving; for blessing bis people in
hiÃ name, and for the performance of all other
offices of our holy religion. Other foundation
can no man lay thÂ«n that is laidâ which is
Jesus Christ, who is God over ailâ blessed for
evermore, in Whom we have redemption,
through his blood, even the forgiveness of
sins. Amen.
The following young ladies and gentle
men furnished the music for the occasion:
Mi<=s Rulofson, Miss Violet Rulofson, Miss E.

gent ; choristers â Henry Â£u!er, Willie Euler;
cross bearers â George Acton, Keaneth Brown,
Arthur Ellert, Charlie Floyd, Lee DeunUon, R.
Smith; Miss Esther Phillips organist.
St. Paul's Church was organized in 1875,
and consequently has just attained its
majority. Key. James McElroy was the
first rector, and under his guidance the
moraberrhip increased rapidly. When the
Rev. Mr. Reilly took charge two years ago
he saw at once that a more commodious
building was needed if the church was to
become a power in its chosen field of
labor. He set about the task with a will
ing henrt, anil the result of his labors is
seen :n the magnificent edityce now being
erectedâ the laying of the cornerstone of
which has already been told. r
Bishop Nichols, in the course of his re
marks, warmly praised the efforts of the
rector, saying that the parish of St. Paul
was the fourth to build a new house of
worship since he was chosen Bishop of
California seven years ago.
TALK OF ANOTHER DIOCESE
Northern California Episconalians
Talk of Leavlnur the Mission
ary Fold.
There is said to be an organized move
ment among the Episcopalians of the
northern oart of the State to convert what
has hitlierto been known as the Mission
ary Jurisdiction of Northern California,
into a diocese. It is given out on what
appears to be good authority, that Eastern
friends have promised to contribute
$10,000 if the Episcopalians in ihe locality
interested will raise a like amount. It is
â¢said that $1200 has already been sub
scribed.
But little is known of the movement in
tbis City, principally for the reason that
there is no connection between the dio
cese of California and the Missionary Jur
isdiction of Northern California, except in
a business way.
"I have heard nothing of such a Move
ment," said Bishop Nichols last nig it.
"t*robably I would be the last to hear of
it. It may be true, but I know absolutely
nothing of it."
Other Episcopal dignitaries disclaimed
any knowledge of a new diocese to be
formed in this State, so it is probable that
the movement has gone no further than
the promise of assistance from Eastern
friends, as already told.

COMPANY B IS AT HOME.
Marched Up Market Street on Its Re
turn From liOS Gatos.
Company B, First Regiment Infantry,
National Guard of California, arrived in
the City at 8:30 o'clock last evening on the
narrow-gange ferry after a week's encamp
ment at Los Gatos. They formed into j
fours and marched up Market street and
out to the armory at Page and Gough
streets. The company made a fine ap
pearance as it marchea on the boat at
Oakland, and was applauded. The fife
and drum corps played "There's One More
River to Cross.
The company broke camp at 5 o'clock at
Los Gatos. At the sound of the bugle all
the tents came down together, and a
hearty cheer was sent. np.
Tnpn retreat was sounded, the cannon
roared, "Old Glory" dropped from the
pole, and Camp City Guard was but a
memory, though a pleasant one.
Major-General James said the camp was
one of the best for single companies he
had seen and that Company B had main
tained the standard of the State troops
while at Los fiatos. General James and
staff and Colonel McDonald and staff re
turned from Los Gatos on an earlier after
noon train. The memoers of Company B
were delighted with their outing.

REPUBLICAN IDEAS
POPULAR NORTH,
Major Kyle Is Greeted
Throughout Lake
County.
GREAT M'KINLEY GAINS
Protection and Sound Money the
Eattk-Cry in Democratic
Precincts.
BRYANISM AN IDLE DREAM.
Former Democrats Renounce Free
Trade aÃd Say They Favor
Sound Money.
Major C. W. Kyle has just returned
from a campaign trip in Lake County
and he reports great Republican gains at
every point visited, the reaction against
the temporary silver craze having already
set in with marked force.
"I was at Lakeport," said he yesterday,
"also at Upper Lake, Kelseyville, Lower
Lake and Middle-town, where I spoke last
niubt. At every point there was the
greatest imaginable enthusiasm. It is
well known that the places I have men
tioned constitute the greatest Democratic
hotbeds in the State, yet after I finished
speaking I was greeted by staid old Dem
ocrats who told me they had resolved to
support McKinley because sound money
and protection are all that wiil save the
country. They see absolutely nothing in
the dreamy philosophy of Bryan and are
sufficiently weary of the Cleveland-Wil
son free trade scheme to want to see it
have a long rest. Anyhow, many of them
frankly told me that they could not rec
ognize their ideas of pure Democracy in
the Chicago platform. To preserve the
interests and industries of the country
tbey nave calmy decided that McKinley
is their onjy refuge."
Major Kyle has made a habit of para
phrasing Bryan's idea of a "Crown of
Thorns," and he has assumed the position
in every speech tbat that crown is free
trade. "Speaking of that phase of the ques
tion yesterday he said:
"American labor has npon its brow a
crown of thorns. The thorns are as sharp
as needle?, and they are being pressed
down into the very heart and soul of Â«ach
and every laborer of America. Think of
it! A crown of thorns where should rest
the wreath of honor and the crown of
power. Think of it! American labor de
graded, deprived of every opportunity for
honest employment and placed beiow
even the peonage of Mexico and the 10
-cent-per-day labor of Japan, China, India
and of all the underpaid labor of the world.
"Who, let me as*, wove that crown of
thorns but the Democrats? Their free
trade heresies are responsible for it all,
and the people are beginning to under
stand it. So suie do I feel of this that Â£
almost believe that we can redeem the
very sections I have oeen visiting.
"While I lay special stress on the tariff
I find there is just as much enthusiasm
for sound money and that the masses
recognize the fact that repudiation is dis
honor; that a dollar must be a dollar the
world over, and that it would do irrepar
able harm to give way to the ideas ad
vanced by such extremists as Bryan. Men
say they want a dollar worth 100 cents the
world over, and they refuse to accept one
worth 50 cents. It is as bard to make the
level-headed masses believe that a fiat will
add to the value of silver as it is to make
them believe a carpenter can say to a tree,
'Thou art a house,' and cause it to be one
by the mere command.
"But what appeals to the masses with
the greatest force is the fact that 60 per
cent of the American factories are idle
and that free trade has checked the w heels
of industry in every part of the land,
while laborers stand idly here by the
Golden Gate and watch the cheap prod
ucts of the Orient and the world come in
without a challenge under Wilsonism and
Bryanism.
"This is a great gold State. We will
probably produce $20,000,000 this year and
we have poured $1,600,000,000 into the lap
of commerce^ince 1849. Until Bryan and
Wilson introduced the serpent of free
trade into this Eden of the Golden West
California was a paradise, and paradise
cannot be retrained until that serpent is
banished and until a fence is built against
the serpent of depreciated currency."
Major Kyle has been recalled at every
point, but the demands on his time are so
numerous that he will not be able to visit
a place more than once, at least until later
in the campaign.

rxp'iination,
The arrow riles with the wind. The top flrnret j
at station Indicate maximum ternpprfttunÂ» for the |
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and htindredths,
durinic the past twelve hour*. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iÂ«oÂ»
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The I
word "hiirh" means high barometric pressure and ;
Is usually accomuanled by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
nnrt acconipHiiipd by clondy weather and rain*.
"Lows" usi ally first appear on the Wushinston
coast. When tho pressure is high in the Interior
and low alone the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
nhle. With a "hlsrh" In ihe vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falllnic to the California coast, wiirmel
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of thesecondttiom
*U1 produce nn opposite result.

BE JUSTIFIED,
Dr. Wendte Supplements
His Sermon of Two
Weeks Ago.
GIVES THREE REASONS.
Self-Murder Is a Crime Against
Self, Against Society and
Against God.
VIEWS OF REV. J. SMALL-
He Denounces Euthanasia and Uses
for a Test the Parable of the
Gccd Samaritan.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Aug. 23. J
The discussion of the subject of suicide
and the death of those whose sufferings
are incurable, that was brought up by the
publication of Rev. Dr. Wendte's sermon
in The Call two weeks ago, is broadening
out and is now the theme of pulpits and
iecture-rooms all over the country.
Dr. Wendte went deeper into the subject
ttiis morning, his theme being, "Is Suicide
Ever Justifiable?" and tors text, "Do
Thyself No Harm." Acts xvi:2B.
After reviewing at length the history of
suicide and giving some statistics of the
ages and nationalities of suicides, Dr.
Wenite said:
"And yet. when I am asked to ask my
self the question whether or not suicide
can ever be justified from a moral point
of view, despite the largest chanty, the !
profoundest sympathy for suffering which !
I can bring to bear, I am compelled to j
anÃwer no! suicide is never justifiable.
Some hold, indeed, that self-destruction is
an indication of insanity; that only the
insane take their own lives. In that case,
of course, there would be no moral re
sponsibility for suicide, and it would not
call for ethereal treatment.
"Many suicides are the result of insanity,
but many are not. Suicide in general
springs from a selfish concentration on
one's own interests, which no high, moral
conception of life's purpose can palliate or
excuse, it is always unjustifiable. Every
violent attempt to shorten our own or an
other's days is a wicked defiance of divine
laws established for the good of humanity.
"Again, suicide is a grievous wrong
against our higher self and has its roots on
selfishness. The man who embraces the
good of others equally with his, own enter
tains no such sickly, morbid feelings as
would prompt him to voluntary death.
"Thirdly, suicide is a wrong against one's
family and near kindred. It deprives
them of your presence and services, and
casts a stigma upon them, and inflicts a
lifelong pain and sorrow.
"Once more, self-destruction is a wrong
committed against human society. Your
fellow-man has a right to your seivices
and loyalty, and should not be deprived
of them.
"I believe in and have recently advo
cated the right and auty of society to cut
short the life of certain of its members in
exceptional and extreme cases. Instances
of this would be capital punishment, war
in protection of society and eutheanasia
in mercy to the sufferers.
"In enthanasia, as Iwouldconductit.no j
wrong is committed against the betterself
of man, for in cases of extreme physical
torture the higher faculties of man become
clouded and unbalanced, and the suffering
endured serves no moral purpose. It
would not wrong the| family, for they
would assent to it. It would not wrong
Bociety, for society itself would undertake j
the duty, and be spared the harrowing i
Bpectacle of unnecessary suffering. It
would transform society, rather, into a
ministering angel of God's mercy or peace.
"But self-murder fulfills none of these
conditions. It is a wrong against self,
against. one's family and fellow men, and
finally â it is an act of impiety against
God."
ANOTHER VIEW.
Rev. James Small Takes the Good
Samaritan for His Model.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 23.â Rev. James j
Small of the First Christian Church took j
the subject of "Suicide and Euthanasia," j
for his subject this morning.
He said in part;
"That to kill off the suffering was Chris
tian and humane is an egregious blunder, j
It is Pagan to the core. They drown and j
kill off the hopeless sufferers in the Pagan i
lands as we would drown or kill off a lit- I
ter of pnps here. But so long as the story
of the Good Samaritan remains with us,
Christian men will never advocate this J
heartless and Pagan notion."
Mr. Small then took up the parable of j
the Good Samaritan and continued:
"We can almost listen to the footsteps-!
of the coming travelers, as did the waiting j
sufferer. Perhaps the languid eye of the
poor, hopeless sufferer saw that the first
man approaching was a clergyman of the
Unitarian school. Hope dawns in his
heart. A man of sorrows and acquainted
with grief and suffering, the wounded j
man must have looked to him for help. !
But this 'religious' man casts a glance at
the sufferer and suggests the idea to kill
off the poor fellow and end his pain. His
retreating footsteps fade gradually away
until nothing is beard but the sighing of i
the wind in the trees, unless it be the j
sound of the sufferer's wailing protest
against the 'religious' man's remedy.
"Soon another traveler approached ; it
was the professor of the College of Den
tistry in Oakland. Be, too, believed in the
One who should heal the broken-hearted
and relieve the distressed. Aeain there
was hope for the wounded sufferer. But
again came the doom of his disappoint
ment. He came and looked on him
and passed by on the other side,
remarking, 'I agree with the Unitarian
doctor, the best remedy is a pood dose of
morphine to put him out of nis misery.'
"Are human hopes thus blasted? Are
there none to pity ? Are there none co give
sympathy? Are human hearts thus cold
and unfeeling? Are the disciples of old
all dead? Has the Christ no followers?
We shall see. Again the silence is bro ken,
this time by the hurried, measured tread
of a burdened beast. The rider is a
woman. A Salvation Army lassie. No
hope there â the traveler is laughed at and
treated as an enemy.
"But the traveler stops her beast, dis
mounts at first night of the wounded man,
sets about caring for him, and hope that
was banished retnrns. The last one from
whom to expect hope is the first one to
give it. And how many times the like has
been repeated in hnman experience! In
times of prosperity friends are all plenty;
in times of adversity not one In twenty.
She tells him of Jesus, who had compas
sion ; i tells him that he will put his arms
around him in trouble and suffering. 'â _'.-' â â -
"Friends, the { deepest â¢ wounds are not
those that bandages cover. Broken hearts
cause deeper sufferings than broken bones.
She does for him that which Christ would
have done had he been here. I ask which
now of these three was neighbor unto the
hopeless sufferer?"

TRICKS OF GYPSIES.
Bobbed the Credulous "Who Visited
Them and Were Frightened
Out of Town.
HAYWARDS, Cal., Aug. 23.-A band
of gypsies camped near here yesterday and
several young people went to the camp to
have their fortunes told. Some of them
now regret it. One young man was told
to put a goldpiece in his mouth while the
fortune-teller told him of his future.
When she had told him the eize of bis
prospective good luck she said it would be
necessary to insure its coming to him to
put the coin in her own mouth. A min
ute later the gypsy was apologizing to the
youth for having swallowed his $5 piece.
Another lady was told to bring bar best
dress and change it in the gypsy's tent.
She did so and when she was returning it
was discovered that another gypsy had
stolen the dress. There was talk of a visit
of a vigilance committee, but before one
was organized the gypsies left.

TO SURVEY THE LAKE
A Government Party Now Camped on
ItÂ« Borders.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Aug. 23.â A party of
Government surveyors, under command of
Lieutenant McCuliy of the United States
steamship McArthur, has commenced a
survey ot Lake Merritt. This is the first
time a Government survey of the lake has
been made. The work is a part of a gen
eral order issued by the Geodetic Depart
ment to survey all large bodies of water of
the Pacific Coast.
The lake will be thoroughly surveyed
and sounded, and a perfect chart will be

the star, although an old-time minstrel
favorite, will make his first Western ap
pearance as an actor wnen the curtain

successful in this play, and the Eastern

TWO BELLIGERENT SWAINS
Frank Delate an^ Tony Johnson
Fight for a Girl's Affec
tions.
A Brutal Slogging Match Near Hay
wards Which Was Interrupted
by the Officers.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, August 23. f
A quarrel over a young lady's affections
resulted in a prize : ring contest of twenty
rounds this afternoon near Haywards.
For several days the plans for the combat
have been kept a secret so as to avoid in
terference by fhe police, and when the
party left Hay wards at noon they departed
a few at a time so as not to attract atten
tion, and in this they were successful.
Shortly after 1 o'clock the principals and
their friends met at a place on Heller's
ranch and held a conference. The prin
cipals are two young and powerful fellows
of Haywards, and for a long time there
has been bad blood between them. The
casus belli was the affections of a young
lady, who is said to live on a ranch near
i Meek's place.
About a week ago it was decided to
meet in open combat and to-day was the
time fixed. As a result of the conference
between the men it was decided that the
contest should take place in a cow corral,
which was about twenty-four feet square.
The principals were Frank Delate and
i Tony Johnson and each weighed about
165 pounds. When stripped they pre
sented a muscular aDpearance, and the
suggestion of their glances as they eyed
one another was not such as to warrant
the idea that there would be any leniency
shown toward each other.
No time was lost iv introducing the
men or in shaking hands, and when
"time" was called they flew at each other
like animals rather than men. In the first
round Johnson did most of the hitting, but
Delate did not seem to Buffer much. Just
as the round closed Johnson landed a fierce
blow on DeJate's cheek and claimed first
blood. The following three rounds were
rather tame, as each man had learned that
! his opponent was neither a coward nor an
j amateur. They sparred cautiously lor a
i good opening, but it did not come till the
I fifth round, when Johnscn landed heavily
on Delates neck and knocked him off his
feet. He was down five seconds, and but
I for the call of time would probably have
I been counted out.
Delate seemed to be getting the worst oi
! it, but he was evidently able to stand any
| amount of punishment and at the close of
the sixth round he took Johnson by sur
prise and closed one of his eyes. This was
the fiart effective work that Delate had
; done and he did it so quickly that his
â  friends regained their hope and cheered
I so loudly that there was nearly a riot
j among the spectators. Delate then com
' menced to turn the tide of fortune, and
! from the tenth to the end of the thirteenth
round he made a toy of his antagonist and
used him up badly.
The fourteenth round was another sur
prise. Johnson braced himself and did
some hard rushing. Delate had worked
j so energetically for the previous twenty
minutes that he was forced to act entirely
on the defensive and in the fifteentn both
were badly punished and winded men.
There was not much fighting in the six
teenth and seventeeth rounds, but what
! there was was done by Delate.
When they came up for the eighteenth
round there was a desire on the part of
the friends of both sides to call the matter
off, but the principals were still sanguine,
and although they presented a most re
pulsivo sight and their clothes were cov
ered with blood they would not give up,
but expressed a desire to continue till one
or the other should be beaten. They could
not tolerate any further suspense as to
who was to have the right of way to the
lady's heart, and so they started promptly
when time was called for the nineteenth
round. Little fighting was done, as both
men were anxious to get their wind.
The twentieth round was just started
and a few vicious blows had been struck
when the alarm was sounded and a cart
was seen driving rapidly over the hill.
One of the men was recognized as ' a
Deputy Sheriff, and when this fact was
made known there was a rush for the
teams and everybody drove off too fast to
permit of any arrests being made. There
was much excitement in Haywards to
night over the affair, and every effort to
obtain the names of anybody but the prin
cipals was in vain.
The heart beats seventy-five times a
minute, sending nearly ten pounds of
blood through the veins and arteries each
beat, and inak^s four beats while we
breathe once.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 1896.
WISH THE NEWS
BUT NOT NOTIONS.
Merchants Want the World
te Know About
Oakland.
IS NOT A BEDCHAMBER.
The Fire Ordinance Would Have
Added Comfort to the
Exposition.
SUGGESTION FOR NEXT YEAB.
Impressions of Oakland's Latest Visitor
of Note, Mrs. Tunnell, the Man
ager of Mattie Overman.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 23. J
One of the most important matters that
bare ever come before the Oakland Board
of Trade is that of undertaking to see that
the great newspapers who profess to have
the interests of this county so much at
'ieart shall act up to their professions.
Not less than 100,000 people are residents
of this county and as there is plenty of
room to sustain three times that number
the only hope of increasing the popula
tion is to attract it from less favored quar
ters. This can only be done through the
medium of the newspapers that go to
every part of the country. To devote a
page of a San Francisco paper to this
county only for the edition that is circu
lated on this side of the bay is of no value
as an advertising medium ana of no value
to the Oaklander who is outside of his
own city and who wants to keep posted
regarding its affairs. It is such small
methods as these that for so long caused
many people to think of and look upon
this city as a colossal bedchamber to San
Francisco.
As regards The Call, the merchants of
this city have always regarded it as their
most stanch supporter, knowing full well
that every copy of its immense daily edi
tion carries to all the centers of civiliza
tion a complete, intelligent and reliable
report of the history of each day of Ala
meda County. The men who are the back
bone of this community have long since
looked with regret upon toe large amount
of space wasted daily by some newspapers
upon guessing contests, story contests,
coupon fakes aimed at deriving a portion
of the profits legitimately the income of
merchants, and similar illegitimate ad
juncts to journalism. More especially did
this feeling increase when it was known
that the space which was of most value to
them was sacrificed to make room for that
which was useless to them. They have
decided it is an unbusinesslike proposi
tion and have wisely threatened to return
the policy of being ignored.
The second exposition is now a matter
of history, but as it is to be an annual af
fair it is but right that there should be
improvements each year based ou the ex
perience of its predecessor. lAst year the
great lesson learned was the need of re
serving a comfortable auditorium in
which the visitors could enjoy tha daily
programmes. This year the lesson to be
solved is how to handle the immense
crowdÃ in the auditorium and galleries.
Last night there were probably 5500 peo
ple witnessing the children's opera. It
can truly be said that the 500 marred to a
great extent the pleasure of the 50000. It
is not easy to see how a few ushers could
have improved matters with such an im
mense crowd, but the Fire Department
could. There is an ordinance which is In
tended for jast such an occasion and
which should not be neglected, even good
naturedly. It was passed by the Council
because it was needed and it provides for
the keeping clear of all aisles in places of
amusement.
It was neglect ed at the exposition, and
that there was no accident in consequence
is no argument in favor of such neglect, as
people never expect accidents. The ordi
nance was not passed to cover the case of
a prayer meeting, where everybody can
have his choice of a score ot seats, but
for just such gatherings as are seen nightly
at the exposition. Next year the crowds
will be as proportionately larger as they
are this year over last, and an enforce
ment of the ordinance will be reciprocated
by the gratitude of 6000 people dally.
This will be a hard winter in Oakland
for politicians should tne Supreme Court
cut the four-year term of county officials
in half. A county campaign would be
like manna on the desert this fall, and
without it it is not easy to see how "the
push" is to exist till it migrates to Sacra
mento at New Year.
The voters are just about as interested
as the officials. There would be many
changes in the county buildings should
an election be held, and in some respects
this is a consummation devoutly to be
wished. 8. W. B.
STRUCK SOME MORE OIL
A Lake of Petroleum Said to Be
Beneath a Ranch at
Livermore.
Former Attempts to Bore Abandoned
for Lack of Sufficient
Capital.
LIVJfiRMORE, Cal., Aug. 23.â A rich
strike of oil has been made on the prop
erty of Louise Daviedes, and her place on
a salt marsh, northwest of town, has sud
denly become a center of great interest.
About three weeks ago, while sinking a
well on Mrs. Daviedes' property, August
Brecht came upon a seam eight feet down
from which petioleum oozed freely. As
they went deeper the cracks became more
numerous and oil more plentiful. At
fifteen feet the workmen were forced to
quit, not having the tools to cut through
the rock. There is about four feet of
water iv the well and several inches on
top in pure petroleum.
The Daviedes well or pit Is on heifwest
line, not over 300 feet from Joseph Brown's
two wells, on higher ground from which
both oil and gas have been flowing for
years. About ten years ago Mr. Guttman
formed a company and entered into ar
rangements with Mr. Brown to bore bis
lands for oil. In the project Mark Liv
ingston, Jerry Sullivan and other San
Francisco capitalists were associated. They
provided themselves with an old-fashioned
boring apparatus, which was forever get
ting out of order. ' .
A San Francisco politician, since dead,
put up all the money. A 12-inch well was
commenced and tank to the depth of 200
feet when nothing was struck and work was
abandoned. This was about ten or eleven
years.
Mr. Brown has been the one single man
of the neighborhood who has clung to the
faith that is in him. Without capital he
could do but little, and that little he has
done with bis own bands. He has drilled
a second well four inches in diameter and
fifty feet deep in sandstone formation, in
the gully below the big well, and has
opened up more evidences of both gas and
oil. The petroleum from these wells has
been used for years by our farmers for
axle grease. This district is in a direct
airline between the coal fields of Mount
Diablo and Corral Hollow. The geological
formation is everything that oil experts
seek when prosDecting, "and as sure as
God made little* potatoes," to quote the
language of farmer Brown, there is a
lake of oil under his ranch.
STUDENT REPUBLICANS.
Preparing for an Active Part In
the Campaign.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 23.âRepub
licanism has fairly established itself
among the young college men in Berkeley,
and they are making active preparations
for a rousing mass-meeting and a vigorous
campaign. They propose toaflihate them
selves with the other Republican clubs of
Berkeley, and to provide themselves with
all the accessories for a street parade, such
as torches, banners and transparencies.
A large quantity of Republican literature
has been received from the State Central
Committee, by President Oliver, for distri
bution among the students.
On next Wednesday afternoon the ssc
ond meeting of the Â»erm will be held, at
which Hou. Lowell J. Hardy Jr., U. C.,66,
candidate for the Assembly from the
Fifty-third District, will speak to the
student citizens.
In about ten days a mass-meeting will
be held, to which all the kindred clubs of
Berkeley will be invited. An effort is be-

ing made to secure either General Barnes
or Judge Carpenter to address the meet
ine.
At the meeting on We dnesday a propo
sition will be made to the students to us:
their military suits for marching, and
wear some regalia indicative of the Re
publican party.
A canvass of the university shows that
there are about 600 students who stand for
McKinleyisna, over 200 of whom are
voters. It is their purpose to make their
influence felt in the campaign that is now
on by turning out in a body and joining
with the other clubs of the town in the ef
fort to elect McKinley.
AT MOUNT EDEN.
Republlcans Arranging for a Big
Moetlru; on September 19.
MOUNT EDEN, Cal., Aug. 23.â The
new wigwam is now being rapidly pushed
to completion and will be completed in
time for the dedication on September 19.
The building will cost about $2300 and
will be an ornament to the valley. It will
also have a commodious gallery.
The arrangements for this great Repub-
lican event are now -about completed.
There will be speeches and other exercises
during the afternoon, the orator being
C. M. Shortridge of the San Francisco
Call. Iv the evening will take place the
grand dedicatory ball.
The enterprise of Mount Eden In build
ing this fine wigwam cannot help but be
appreciated by the Republicans ail over
the country, and it is certain that there
will be a large representation from every
section.
Undoubtedly nearly every Republican
as well as members of other parties will
have a natural curiosity to see what the
little village of Mount Eden has done in
the way of building a handsome Republi
can wigwam, and when they come to the
"Hamlet by the Sea" they will find a
structure as fine as has ever been erected
in this county for political purposes.

The undersigned having been assigned by

Colonel First Infantry.
The new commander is on duty every
day at military headquarters in the Jfhe-
Lan building, and with the able assistance
of Colonel O. D. Greene, adjutant-general
of the department, readily transacts the
regular business of the day.
A general court-martial convened at the
Presidio last Wednesday, consisting of the
following officers: Major Tully McCrea,
Fifth Artillery; Captain Charles Morris,
Fifth Artillery ; Captain Benjamin K. Rob
erts, Fifth Artillery; Captain Frank Thorp,
Fifth Artillery; Captain ElbridgeÃ. Hills,
Fifth Artillery; First Lieutenant Oliver E.
Wood, Fifth Artillery; Second Lieutenant

Newcomb, Fifth Artillery, judge advocate.
A communication as follows from the
headquarters t>f the army in Washington
addressed to the commanding general of
the Department of California is published
for the guidance of troops serving in this
region :
I have the honor to inform you that the
major-general commanding the army approves
the issue of certificates and Insignia for quali
fication as sharpshooter and marksman, and
directs that the report of sharpshooters and
marksmen be made on old form 30-d, Small
Arms Firing Regulations, and that it show
previous years of qualification as sharpshooter
or marksman in each case.
On account of prolonged field service the
order for pistol and carbine practice of the
cavslry in this department is so far modi
tied as to designate the months of August,
September and October as the period for
this season's practice for Trcops C and L,
Fourth Cavalry, in the Sequoia and Gen
eral Grant National Parks, the revolver
practice to precede that with the carbine.
The four troops of the Fourth Cavalry,
now guarding the reservations in the
Sierra, are said to be doing excellent work
in extending and reopening the trails.
The duly is arduous, but the hunting and
fishing afford pleasure.
Captain George H. Gale of Troop C, who
came down from the mountains a few
days ago on a short leave of absence, told
some trout-catching stories at the Presi
dio last Saturday. He reports that the
quail and grouse are so plentiful that the
men can catch the young chickens.
It is the question in the minds of many
of the officers if it would not be well for
the Government to lease some of the
forest reserves to cattlemen. Something
should be done to prevent the dense ac
cumulation of dead and fallen timber. So
much inflammable material is accumu
lating that a fire once under way would
produce heat so fierce as to cause the
destruction of live trees.
The fallen timber and the lifeless stand
ing trees should be gradually consumed
in order to diminish the dangerous stock
of fuel. This might be done under a proper
system of leasing. The area of country
patroled by the Fourth Cavalry is very ex
tensive. It is easy enough to guard the
parks, such as the Sequoia, Yosemite and
General Grant National parks, but the vast
forest reservation cannot be guarded. It
can only be watched.
The United States Army Retiring Board,
which was in session for several weeks in
Chicago, has adjourned to meet in San
Francisco, October 1, next. In the case of
Colonel Crofton, Fifteenth Infantry, who
was recommended for retirement, the
board did not sustain the recommenda
tion, so he v.ill probably serve until 1898,
unless the President of the United States
should exercise his prerogative of placing
him on the retired list.
The case of Major J. A. Darling, Fifth
Artillery, will be con&idered when the
board . convenes at the Presidio next
October. In all other cases brought be
fore the board retirement was recom
mended.
Word comes from Washington that in
the redistribution of artillery one of the
first Western posts to receive the atten
tion of General Miles will be San Fran
cisco. It is the intention to locate five
artillery stations around this City â one at
Lime Point, one at Point Lobos, one at
Aleatraz, one at Angel Island and one at
Black Point. General Miles saia that
guns were being erected at each of these
points, which would necessitate the

ALA M EDA, Cal., Aug. 23.â This after
noon Officer Brampton arrested William
Goobey for taming in a false fire alarm on
the night of August 13. This was the
night when the big fire occurred at Bay
street station. The hose wagons and fore
men had not much more than returned
and changed their wet clothes when an

NAMED IN HONOR
OF PROFESSORS,
Two Peaks Almost as High
as Stately Mount
Shasta.
NEAR KINGS RIVER.
Mt. Senger Stands 13,000 Feet
High and Mt. Hilgard 12,900
Feet
TTFES OF MAGNIFICENCE.
School Directors Object to Having
Pupils Vaccinatedâ They Say
It Is Useless.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 2aâ Two
peaks of the Sierras in the Kings River
District almost as high as stately Shasta
have recently been named in honor of
two, University professors. They have
been called by the Sierra Club Mount
Hilgard and Mount Senger, the first in
honor of Professor E. W. Hilgard, heaa
of the Department of Agriculture, and
the second in honor of Professor Henry
Senger, assistant professor of German.
Mount Hilgard stands 12,900 feet above
the sea level, while Mount Senger pierces
the air to the distance of 13,000 feet. The
former lies in north latitude 37 degrees
20 minutes and east longitude 118 degrees
49 minutes, while the latter is located a
few miles below it in the same range, in
north latitude 37 degrees 19 minutes and
in east longitude 118 degrees 51 minutes.
Both are north of Mount Ooddard and
remain snow-capped through all the sea
sons. The district in which these two
peaks are situated is wild and rugged, and
only the most venturesome of travelers
approach them. They are reaohed most
advantageously by Bear Creek, one of the
large tributaries of the San Joaquin River
in Inyo County. A number of university
students visited the district in which these
mountains are located, last vacation, and
report that the two mountains are types of
grandeur and magnificence.
Three other tall peaks in California and
one in Nevada already bear tha names of
Berkeley professors. In Tuolumne County
is Mount Le Conte, in the Shasta region
Mount Bradley, in the Yosemite district
Mount Huffman, and in Washoe County,
Nev., the celebrated Mount Davidson.
Opposed to Vaccination.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 23.â Several
members of the Board of Education are
inclined to protest against the recent edict
sent forth by Health Officer Rowell. in
compliance with the State law, ordering
that all unvaccinated pupils in the Berke
ley schools be inoculated forthwith.
The members of the School Board who
demur against the consummation of the
Health Officer's instructions do so on the
grounds that they fear the remedy will
be as bad as the disease for the preven
tion of which it is given. They say that
it is as dangerous as the tuberculosis cure
itself and is in reality not a necessity in
Berkeley, where tbe dread disease of
smallpox is so uniiiiely to establish itself.
Directors Norton of the Fifth Ward and
Englebretsen of the Seventh Ward are
the two most outspoken of the seven
board members.
At their next meeting the matter will
be brought up for discussion, and final
action will be taken as to whether or not
they will obey the State law which re
quires vaccination among school children.
Meanwhile, the Health Officer is vaccinat
ing wherever necessary.
Won by the Negro.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. 23.â The region
of University avenne, "West Berkeley, was
a scene of wild excitement this afternoon
over a 75-yard footrace between Joseph
Segui. a colored member of the West
Berkeley Athletic Club, and Archie Bee
man of Lorin. Segui defeated Beeman in
eight seconds dv about a yard and a half.
A $50 wager was up and an old score was
to be paid off, both of which facts added
interest to the coutest. About half of the
West Berkeley population was on the
scene at the crack o: the pistol and cheered
the contestants. Beeman cays he will
meet Segui again.

A SURPRISE IN
STORE FOR THEM,
Public Schools the Pal
ladium of American
Liberty.
THE NEED FOR CULTURE
Ignorance of the People Natu
rally Hostile to Patriot
ism.
RIGHTS OF CHURCH AND STATE
Address of the Rev. W. T. Fieenor
Yesterday in Metropolitan
Hall.
"I expect," said H. W. Quitzow, the
chairman, in opening the good citizen
ship meeting yesterday afternoon in Met
ropolitan Hall, "soon to make an an
nouncement that will greatly surprise and
please you."
Although the chairman did not specify
what was the surprise mentioned by him
the audience ioudly applauded.
Then the Rev. W. T. Fieenor of Seattle,
the orator of the day, was introduced.
His subject was "Our Public Schools, the
Palladium of American Liberty," and in
the course of his address he said:
"We possess brains and principles.
They are infinitely better than the dollars
of our enemies. We can also boast of a
good conscience, which is of far more
value than gold and silver. I believe in
education, and victory for our principles
is to be won only through the heroism
and patriotism of our people.
"The notes of liberty rung out by inde
pendence beli mean far more to-day than
they did in the past We are the custodi
ans of the Declaration of Independence
and we must defend the rights of Ameri
can liberty. Our cublic schools are a
heavenly boon, born and bred and devel
oped with freedom. The little red school
house sat over on the hill and superin
tended the building of Bunker Hill monu
ment. Our schools gave the brain, the
blood and the sacrifice that drove the last
redcoat from American soil. Thb schools
are neither an incident nor an accident.
They are the germ of freedom on land and
on sea.
"We claim the divine right to educate
our own people, and we can never recog
nize the union of church and state. This
country must analyze and determine the
quality of its citizens, and what is needed
more than anything else for the salvation
of our Nation is to give character to its
people. American patriotism is purely an
American product, and it is in the public
schools that patriotism is implanted and
developtd.
"The danger to our institutions lies in
imported ignorance, which can be trans
formed only by culture. Forty per cent of
the Irish and French-Canadians of New
England can neither read nor write. Jef
ferson has said that the public schools are
an essential feature of our Government,
and Grant said that not a dollar of the
public money should be given to the sup
port of sectarian schools.
"Rome is to-day hostile to our public
schools, because they mean death to Ro
manism. We must have virtue as well as
culture, and I favor compulsory educa
tion. In our public schools 12,000,000 of
children are studying the constitution and
history of the American Republic. Papal
ism is the giant foe to our schools, and
an ally of ignorance. It tries to destroy
them by public slander, and by demorali
zation. If I had my way, I would hang
every man and woman uttering any trea
sonable sentiments against this Govern
ment. Bishop Hughes says the public
schools are 9 disgrace to civilization;
.Father Walker thinks them nurseries of
vice; Priest McCarthy calls them National
frauds, and Bishop Ireland says they are
fit only to train horsethieves and murder
ers. Bishop Spauldmg, however, asserts
that the public schools mean life to the
Republic, and death to Romanism, to
which sentiment I say amen.
"Rome now realizes that she must get
the Stars and Stripes off the little red
schoolhouse before she can tear it down.
The mutilation of the flag, even in the
privacy of our own homes, should be a
felony and amenable to a severe punish
ment. The trouble with us Americans is
that we are too tolerant. The parian
scnools, which Rome wishes to substitute
for our free public schools, are arrant hum
bugs. They do not educate their pupils,
but teach only a slavish devotion to the
church.
"I hold that no church should have a
voice in State education, and as I have al
ready said, that is where the danger lies.
To overcome these difficulties let all good
American citizens stand firmly by the
constitution and the fiag of the United
States of America and the principles of the
American Protective Association."
Chairman Quitzow announced that in
future admission to the Sunday gather
ings would be free, since in this way the
sentiments of the association could be
more widely extended.
After singing the "Battle Hymn of the
Republic the audience dispersed.

REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
Another Parcel of the Murphy
Homestead Sold at
Auction.
GOOD FBICES WERE REALIZED.
Business Ts Materially Affected by
Banks Declining to Make
Loans.
The real estate market In this City has not
been so dull for years as it is at present. It is
all due to the uncertain feeling that the money
question in the Presidential campaign is caus
ing. Probably the chief cause of the dullness
is the fact that the savings banks have practi
cally ceased making loans, and there is no
reason to hope that they will alter their course
in this respect until after election. Not alone
are the banks not making new loans, but it is
difficult to obtain renewals of loans when the
latter fall due. This condition of affairs is not
calculated to make real estate men feel ve*y
cheerful, but they are trying to submit to the
situation with- the best grace possible.
The few sales that are being made are of
small properties and the purchasers are
usually those who are not dependent upon the
saving!; banks for money with which to buy.
The building and loan societies are just now
en loving something of a boom, as borrowers
who are refused money at the banks have in
many instances turned to the building and
loan associations for relief, and as a result the
latter are now placing considerable sums on
real estate on terms that are profitable to
shareholders.
It was suggested by a well-known real-estate
man, while discussing the subject the other
day, that the present attitude of the savings
banks, while justified by circumstances,
might ultimately injure their business by
causing a marked increase in the number of
building and loan societies, which would
naturally result in a decrea.se in deposits in
the savings banks.
In many Eastern cities the building and
loan associations have almost entirely taken
the place of savings banks. As building asso
ciation loans are payable in either weekly or
monthly installments, it is impossible in times
like these to cause unusual hardship among
borrowers, it being only necessary for the lat
ter to keep up their regular installment pay
| ments. It is not so difficult to make weekly
payments of $10 to $20 on a loan as it is to be
suddenly called upon by a savings bank to
take up a loan at a time when all these ave
nues for obtaining money are practically
closed.
The auction sale held last Saturday by Eas
ton, Eldridge & Co. of another parcel of the
Murphy ranch in the Santa Clara Valley
should be encouraging to parties dealing in
country lands. While the prices obtained
were not quite as high as those obtained at the
former safe, yet they were quite satisfactory.
Out of the thirty-five Dieces offered twenty
three were sold, and Wendell Kaston stated
that the remaining twelve pieces were prac
tically disposed of, as they would be sold
within a few days at private sale. The num
ber of acres sold was 218, the total amount
realized being $26,300, an average of a little
over $120 per acre. The list of purchasers and
the prices obtained for each tract was as fol
lows:

BOURBON SPIDERS
BUILDING WEBS,
Desperate Efforts to Swal
low the Populist
Flies.
THE GAME IS A BOLD ONE
Democratic Desperation Drives
the Leaders Into Bunko
Schemes.
TKYING TO MAKE CONGRESSMEN
But Some Popu ists and Some Demo
crats Object to Being Taken for
Political Hayseeds.
There was a great deal of amusement in
political circles yesterday over the bold
scheme of the Democrats to beat the Pop
ulists in Congressional districts by fixing
the cards in advance and then inviting
the unsophisticated to play a game ot
political whist, the trumps and strong
suits being in the hands of the wily
Bourbons.
If the scheme works there will be as
complete a loss of identity in the case of
the Populists as there is in the case of a
froc when swallowed by a snake.
The duty of mesm-rizing the Populists
devolves quite largely upon ex-Congress
man Caminetti, who is the sub-committee
man of the Democrats, appointed to see
that John S. Dore of Fresno, representing
the Populists, has a proper salivary coat
ing before the committee of fifteen shall
attempt the gastronomic feat of swallow
ing him as a morsel of vicarious atonement
for the weaknesses of his party.
Strange as it may seem, yet not more
wonderful than the gold-brick swindle, the
Democrats have had the effrontery to
evolve a scheme by which all Congres
sional nominees shall resign and leave the
selection of candidates to a committee in
which Democrats will be the controlling
force.
To carry on this shell game of politics
they have led out ex-Judge Maguire of
the Fourth and Delegate Patton of the
Sixth districts to make the first bet on the
contents of the shells, hoping thereby to
induce Candidates Monteitn, McGlashan,
Rogers, Barlow and Castle of t!ie Populist
party to lose their political fortunes on
the second bet.
There is a nice little piece of illusion
work back of the scenes in the case of
Congressman James G. Maguire. He
comes up boldly in the Fourth District
and resigns. On its face this would look
as if he had proffered himself as a burnt
offering on the altar of his party, fearing
nothing. The heroics fail, however, when
it is remembered that in his particular
district the Populists have made no nomi
nation.
Committeemen Dore, Lawlor and Cami
netti are to meet at the Lick House at 9
a. m. to-day to confer further on how the
big Democratic spiders are to swallow the
little Populistic flies that are just now
buzzing with unusual activity about the
parlors of the Bourbons. In his heart Mr.
Caminetti believes that the Bourbon spi
ders cannot weave enough cloth of gold
about the treacherous web to hide the
lethal chamber from view, but the at
tempt will be made to-day. Each of the
committeemen is to bring his plan and if
the dice can be loaded skillfully every
thing will be well for Democracy, other
wise the fusion will fail.
There is likely to be a great deal of fun
in several instances, particularly in the
Fifth, where the Democratic candidate
chances to be up to ways that are peculiar
himself, and Joe Kelly is his name. Never
was heathen Chinee more mysterious in
"ways that are dark and tricks that are
vain," and somebody may rise to explain
ere lonp that the wily Joseph has carried
away everything on the table and left the
bunko-steerers musing over their short
sightedness in taking him fora political
uayseed. Mr. Kelly will certainly arise to
explain that he objects to being bunkoed.
Another Populist with a large bump of
suspicion is George W. Monteith of the
First District, who thinks he sees the fine
hand of Huntington back of every odd
movement; who looks for political bush
whackers behind every waving bush, and
who denies that he is a wild man from
Borneo to be lassoed and put on exhibi
tion as a sample of political paresis. He
came to town too long ago for that.
There are not webs enough to hold Dr.
Castle of the Seventh, a Populist with a
fighting record and with strength and
sinews enough to nreak down many a po
litical fence aui> ru i swiftly into tbe open
fields. Taylor .^ ; ers of the Fifth, it is
said, will not res. mi unless hÂ« practically
holds a renommation up his sleeve.
The only points agreed on at yesterday's
informal conference are these: If fusion
takes place the candidates selected must
accept three cardinal principlesâ the free
eilver idea, Government management of
KEW TO-DAT.

Candidate Maddux of the Seventh, an
old time Democrat, is likely to cause a
great deal of trouble, because he believes
nothing can beat him, and he has already
stumped a large part of the district at con
siderable outlay of his own time and
money.
Another snag ahead is in tbe Third
District, wherein the Populists and Demo
crats hold their conventions on the 4th of
September at Vallejo. It is almost certain
that they will not be able to agree, each
party claiming everything in sight.
From the strife and confusion generally
prevailing, it is evident that the Populists
do not propose to die without a great
struggle, and there are many signs that
the attempt at fusion in the Congressional
districts will be a Don Quixotic farce.
A REBELLIOUS SON.
No Man Who Is False to Himself
Can Be True to
Others.
A very practical subject was discuised
in a very practical way in Mrs. Cooper's
Bible class yesterday. It was based upon
Absalom's attempt to usurp the throne of
his father, David. In her opening remarks
Mrs. Cooper said: "Sad as we may feel for
David we cannot forget that the monstrous
ingratitude and inhumanity of Absalom
poiius back to the same traits in David, as
shown in his treatment of Uriah. From
the time of that great transgression David
had to bear the judgment of the Lord.
Years were added to the life of the King,
but he was bent down under an invisible
load. It is now ten years since the foul
crime against Usiah. Nathan had told him
that the sword would never depart from
his house. It was verified. And now his
own son, Absalom, is conspiring to usurp
his father's throne. We see the craft and
the intrigue. It reads like modern politi
cal intrigues. There is the same sort of
electioneering, the same senseless ostenta
tion, the same bending of the knee that
thrift might follow fawning. Samuel and
David had set an example of noble sim
plicity, but Absalom did not like 'plain
living and high thinking.' "
In speaking of Absalom's speech to the
people Mrs. Cooper said : "It is a fair spec
imen of the everlasting speech of the dem
agogue in all times and in all countries.
'Just try me, and I will see that justice is
done to everybody !' Absalom prostituted
every holy instinct, every noble purpose,
to selrisn ends. He counterfeited affection,
be simulated friendship. David had him
self to blame for the lack of character in
Absalom. Parents must be what they
would have their children to be. The true
object of all government, whether in fam
ily or state, is self-government. No one
can properly govern others who has not
first learned how to govern himself. David
had not taught his son self-government.
The â nd was self-destruction. There is too
much of ' bringing up ' of children and too
little of the 'training up' of children. It
tatces a man of very tine sense to carry him
self well If he is very handsome. Fathers
ought never to be so busy with public af
fairs as to neglect their children. Chil
dren have more need of models than of
critics."
AN IDEAL EXCURSION.
Manager Locke Gives Many People a
Specially Pleasant Trip to l>un
canfi Mills.
Yesterday's special excursion to Dun
cans Mills, Cazadero and the big trees on
Austin Creek and Russian River, over the
North Pacific Coast Railroad, was a posi
tive success, notwithstanding it was the
second edition of the Sunday before.
Excursion Manager Locke, in his usual
systematic manner, looked after the pre
paratory details necessary for the comfort
of his patrons, and personally conducted
the excursion to the satisfaction of all.
The ride, with its variety of scenes of in
terest, is one of the most interesting single
day trips out of the metropolis, and for
the distance traveled is one of the cheap
est in the State, at the popular rate of
$1 50.
The train ran through on good time to
Duncans Mills, where an hour's stop was
made for dinner. The ride was then con
tinued to Elm Grove and Cazadero. One
of the best features of the trip was the
stop at Moscow cottage on the return trip,
where Mr. and Mrs. Morris Newton re
ceived the visitors on the front veranda,
from which an inspiring view of the Rus
sian River is had. Mr. Newton, with
great thoughtfulness and his usual hospi
tality, had a refreshment table out on the
lawn, where an attendant served iced
punch to all the visitors. Thence a good
run was made for Sausalito, the party ar
riving in tbe City about 8:30 last evening.
Mr. Locke's next venture will be a spe
cial train for Bohemia Grove, where the
Bohemian Club held its jinks Saturday
nigbt, for Sunday, September 6, when a
popular rate will be offered the public,
with the added attraction of reserved
seats.
DISEASED MEAT FOR SALE
H. F. Stoliz, a Butcher, Is
Arrested on Three
Charges.
Slaughtered a Cow on His Premises
That Was Found to Be Badly
Diseased.
One of the worst cases that has come
under the notice of Meat Inspector Ben
Davis was investigated by him yesterday
afternoon.
Policeman Smith, who is stationed in
the Mission district, notified the Meat In
spector by telephone about 1 o'clock that
H. F. Stoltz, butcher, Pride of the Valley
Market, 510 Castro street, had during the
night killed a diseased cow on his prem
ises.
Davis at once drove out to the place He
! could not find Stoltz, but he had no
i trouble in getting into the shop, as the
| door was open. He saw a block and
j tackle hanging from a beam and other
j evidences that a cow bad been slaugh
tered.
He examined the beef hanging up in tbe
shop, the condition of which aroused his
suspicions. In the yard among a pile of
manure he found the head and the rest of
the offal, which he took possession of.
He carefully examined the head and dis
covered a big lump over one of the eyes,
which satisfied him that the animal had
been diseased. In other words, that it
had been suffering from lumpy jaw.
Inquiries were made among the neigh
bors as to whether they Knew anything of
the cow having been slaughtered, but
Davis could get no satisfactory statement
from any of them. He learned, however,
that a nephew of Stoltz had seen the cow
slaughtered, but the boy was not at home
and he could not get his statement.
Davis took tbe head and offal to Dr. I.
W. O'Rourke, 331 Golden Gate avenue,
who carefully examined them and handed
Davis the following brief report of what he
had found:
"A large actinomycotic tumor which
penetrated deeply icto the frontal sinus
of the skull. The iuugs were tuberculous."
The Meat Inspector swore out com
plaints against Stoltz on three charges
of violating the health ordinance; one
for depositing offal on his premises, an
other for exposing diseased meat for sale
and the third for slaughtering a cow out
side the regular limits.
Stoltz was arrested last night by Officer
P. G. Smith. He was released on $50 ba.l
for each charge.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 1896.
FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
Rev. Peter C Yorke, Editor of the Monitor,
Approves of the Stand of Charles M*
Shortridge, Editor of "The Call/
The following excerpt is from an editorial which appeared in
the last issue of the San Francisco Monitor, of which the Rev.
Peter C. Yorke is editor :
We publish this week the answer given by Mr. Charles M- Shortridge
to the seven questions propounded to him by the editor of the Monitor.
These seven questions covered the whole ground gone over by this paper
since last May. They included the chief charges made against THE CALL,
its editor and his friends. An answer to them would have been an answer
to the weightier questions which we have been asking every week for over
three months. We are glad to make public acknowledgment now that the
letter of Mr. Charles M. Shortridge is satisfactory to us. We have not
asked for proof or for testimony. We have declared that we are willing to
take Mr. Shortridge' s unsupported word as we would take the unsupported
word of any honest man against such accusers. That word has now been
given. He solemnly and with circumstance denies the charges made against
himself, and on the authority of his friends he denies the charges made
against them. We accept the denial and are satisfied with it.
Though we are satisfied with the denial, we still believe that we have
had good and sufficient reason for making the charges. Our only regret is
that the denial was not made long ago. The evidence which had
accumulated appeared sufficient to convict any man in a court of
law. True it was the evidence of such characterless frauds as Hudel
son, Marshall, Ross, Brewer, Owen and Kyle. But backed up as it
was by the silence of THE CALL it appeared irrefragable. At any mo
ment it might have been overthrown by a word as a house of cards is
overthrown by a breath, but the word was not spoken. We asked and
asked and asked for an answer, for only by an answer could we satisfy
our minds. Now we are glad, heartily glad, that the answer has been
given, and the reverend and irreverend defenders of our country can tell
the courts thereof how beautifully they quarreled over the chickens
before the same were hatched.
We cannot refrain from complimenting Mr. Shortridge on the liberal
and American sentiments with which he concludes his letter. For the
first time since this unhappy struggle began in San Francisco the editor
of a great morning journal has declared his belief in the fundamental
principles of religious freedom. It may appear extraordinary that such a
thing could be, but as Mr. Charles M. Shortridge was the pioneer in
giving a fair hearing to both sides in the controversy, so he has been the
pioneer in proclaiming that neither the threats of bigotry nor the fear of
financial loss can prevent him from exercising his constitutional rights
to be just to men of every religion and of none.
HE IS A WARD
OF THE SPIRITS,
The Odd Baptism Last
Night of Otis Lincoln
Johnson.
SPIRITS TO GUARD HIM.
Many Were Considered Present,
Though Invisible to
Spectators.
FLOWERS OF TETJTH AND LIFE.
A Pleasing Ceremony and an Event
in Local Spiritualistic
Circles.
Quite a number of spiritualists assembled
in Scottish Hall last evening to do honor
to the christening of Otis Lincoln John
son, a native son, some three months of
age.
All unconscious of the momentous era
in his life, the infant was banded pas
sively from the arms of his mother to
those of Mrs. G. W. Shriner, the medium,
by whom the rites of baptism were per
formed. Considered all in ali, it marked
an epoch in tbe spiritual and material life
of the youngest participant, who was the
lion of the evening.
At an early hour the hall was well filled.
Mrs. Q. W. Shriner presided and at 8
o'clock the exercises were opened with the
singing of the favorite hymn, "Nearer,
My God, to Thee." "Independence Bell,"
tbe patriotic poem, was then recited in
spirited style by little Alice Wilson.
A distinguished medium, recently from
St. Paul, Minn., next talked to the audi
ence. "It is confidently expected," she
said, "that the good spirits gathered here
to-night will aid in the rapid unfolding of
the spiritual nature of the child tlvat has
been brought to us by its fond parents for
baptism.
'â¢Let them not forget it is their duty to
see that the child is well clothed and fed.
They should also be prepared to answer
any and all questions it may put to them.
Childhood is an emblem of beauty and
purity. In man there is a spiritual as
well as a material, nature, and the har
monious blending of tnese is what we
should strive to understand and to con
summate. In this connection it is well to
remember that the child is the man.
"So, I say to you, search diligently for
wisdom, so that you may save yourselves
from ignorance and superstition. Edu
cate your little ones. Take them among
the flowers and the rocks, tell them to
Mrs. Kato Uoskins of St. Panl. Otis Lincoln Johnson, Aged 3 Months. Mrs. G. W. Shriner, Isychlc
Jisten to the voice of the infinite God, and
let them learn that the great uplifting
power is spirituality.
"The child with us to-night will draw
around it the spiritual influence of ita
parents and with the friendliness of the
host of other spirits here present to aid it
will acquire a firmer hold upon earth-life
than would be possible for it to do without
the aid of these friendly powers. Let us
deck it, then, with the "flowers of purity,
truth and life."
Mrs. Shriner said: "I babtize thee in
the name of the Father, the Son and the
Holy Spirit. May thy life be as bright as
the flowers you now hold (throwing into
his lap a lot of red and white sweet peas).
I call upon the spirit world to give this
child a guide through life."
The ceremony of baptism thus ended,
the infant was passed back into the arms
of its waiting mother and the feature of
the evening was over.
The remainder of the time was taken up
with songs and recitations and tests by
Mrs. W. X. Robertson and Mrs. K. S.
Aiken. Such is tbe history of a memor
able night in San Francisco spiritualism.
FROM THE ROOF TO DEATH.
Sleven Mencaci's Mysterious Ambula-
t inn Over the Top of a House.
Sleven Mencaci met death yesterday
morning in a rather mysterious manner.
From what could be learned from the
people living at Nos. 10 ana 12 August
alley, a narrow by-way off Green streeC be
tween Powell and Mason, Mencaci left his
bedroom at 6:30 o'clock clad in his drawers
and undersiiirt and climbed on to the
slanting roof of No. 12, which adjoins No.
10, the house wbere he bad been rooming.
Crossing over the roof to the north side he
either jumped or feil to the vaid below, a
distance of about fourteen feet.
In his downward course he must have
struck the tup of a board fence which
divides the adjoining lots. The fall at
tracted the attention of the family living
in No. 12, who, on making an investiga
tion, discovered him lying in the yard.
j He was placed in a hackand driven to the
County Hospital, where he lingered in
great agony until 1 o'clock, when he died.
His body was removed to ihe Morgue.
He was not intoxicated nor was he a
somnambulist so far as could be ascer
| tamed.

Two callow youths created considerable

however, to paying a double reckoning,

prietor attracted a crowd. The arrival of
an officer convinced the youths that they
had better settle, and the apparently im

WHEELMEN ARE
GOING TO FIGHT,
They Object to Paying
Fare for Their
Bicycles.
SEEK LEGISLATIVE AID.
An Effort Will Be Made for a
Law Similar to That of
New York.
STETSON FAVOKS THE BIKE-
The President of the North Pacific
Coast Road Says His Company
Will Encourage Wheeling.
"Commencing September 1, 1896, 25 cents
will be the charge for the transportation
in baggage-car of a bicycle, a tricycle or a
baby carriage between any two points."
So say the powers that be of the Southern
Pacific. And the wheelmen of the City,
whose name is legion, rise up in their
might and say "nit." Tricycles and baby
carriages may be taxed all the traffic can
bear, but the bicycle they say must go
free. And what is more to the point they
say they are numerous enough and ener
getic enough to see that it does go free.
The war upon the free transportation of
bicycles has been waged quietly but ef
fectively by the railroad company for some
time, but the statement that in the near
future the silent steed would at one fell
swoop be deprived of all its privileges
a-rail came to the bicyclists with consid
erable of a shock. Heretofore it has been
the custom to charge upon certain por
tions of the road, not for any apparent
reason, but simply because that was
orders.
For instance, a prominent clubman says
he was recently charged 50 cents trans
portation for his wheel to Napa and re
turn. On other portions of the road trans
portation has been gratis, but single riders
nave found it advantageous to "make it
all right" with the baggageman. Other
wise the wheelman was apt to find that
his eigteen-pound racer had been snugly
stored with a couple of Saratogas on top
of it.
Now the edict has gone forth that the
ridors are to pay for their mounts on all
portions of the Southern Pacific, and that
includes the Oakland ferry. That is the
most unkindest cut, for it lias long been
the custom of San Francitco wneelmen to
visit the other side of the bay in hordes on
Sundays and holidays.
It was on the other side of the bay that
the road races have been held and it was
trom there that the majority of riders
started for San Jose and upon other runs
to points of interest. And now Mr. Hunt
ington says they must pay 10 cents for
each wheel each way and that raise the
issue between Mr. Huntington aud the
railroad.
The system in vogue on those portions
of tbe road where a el arge is made for
wheels and which will doubtless be
adopted over all the roads, is to make out
an "excess baggage slip" for the wheel
men, that is a statement that the traveler
is provided with baggage in excess of the
100 pounds allowed, albeit the airy bike
would not tip the scales at more than
twenty-two or twenty-three pounds and
its owner's other baggage is hidden in the
not commodious pockets of a scant bicycle
suit. And for this "excess" a uniform
rate of 25 cents will be chanred. The
riders claim this is an unfair and un
reasonable discrimination and how to cir
cumvent the railroad was the main topic
of conversation in clu brooms yesterday.
"This ia a matter which the League of
American Wheeimen will take Dp and
hght vigorously," said S. Plummer, di
rector of the Bay City Wheelmen. "The
league has been fighting such moves on
the part of railroads all over the country,
and has met with a large degree of suc
cess. In New York an act has been passed
making it unlawful for a railroad com
pany to charge for bicycles as excess bag
gage, and we will make an effort to have
a similar enactment in this State. The
wheelmen all over the coast sire interested
in this matter. San Jose, Stockton, Sac
ramento, Los Angeles, in fact, all the
wheeling clubs in the State are preparing
to make a vigorous campaign, and they
will be joined by the many thousands of
unattached wheelmen.
"I do not deny that it is a nuisance to
handle wheels in a baggaee-car, but this
can be greatly obviated here as it has else
where by the provision of racks and hooks.
The Southern Pacific has already had
plans presented to it for stowing away
wheels. They will eventually have tb
adopt some plan of the kind.
"In some of the Eastern States a plan
was carried into effect by the racing men
which surprised the raHroad. The racing
men there are very numerous and do much
traveling. Each had a good stout trunk
provided for Lis wheel, and when fifty or
a hundred of them started for a meet their
load of trunks' looked like a hotel-moving.
The baggagemen groaned when they saw
them coming, and there was no excess to
pay. Trunks had to be checked free.
Something of that kind might prove ad
vantageous here."
At the Imperial Cyclinp Club quarters
the proposed change was discussed with
wry faces. "We will fieht that proposi
tion to the bitter end," said Lieutenant
Charles Trolliet. "There are a great many
wheelmen in this City and they will make
themselves felt in politics. In the mean
time we will probably hold our road races
and our runs on this side of the bay or in
the vicinity of Sausalito. Many of the
boys who have been in the habit of taking
frequent trips to San Jose and other dis
tant points, returning by rail, will proba
bly content themselves with shorter rides
rather than be subjected to an extra
charge.

many riders who live in Oakland and
work in this City. They have been accus
tomed to bring "their wheels with them
and ride to and from work. A charge cf
20 cents a day would be a material item in
their weekly expenses."
Frank Byrne, the well-known racing
man, aJyo expressed tbe opinion that ex
cursions across the bay would be very in
frequent while the charge for bicycles was
in effect.
The only route out of the City which is
largely patronized by wheelmen and is
not controlled by the Southern Pacific is
the North Pacific Coast Railroad via Sau
salito. James B. Stetson, president of the
road, says his company has no intention
of charging for bicycles. "It has always
been our policy to encourage bicycles to
use our line," he said. "We do not get all
of the mileage they travel, but are glad to
get what we can. \Ye have always tried t3
make things convenient for them, and on
Sundays put on an extra car to carry their
wheels.
"I recognize the fact that wheelmen are
not the nabobs of the land. They are
mostly young men who are working fora
salary. A bicycle I consider a most ad
vantaceous lecreation for them and see no
reason why its uses should be discour
aged or made expensive. I have always
worked for the improvement of the roads
about Sausalito, though that may seem a
rather negative position for a railroad. I
believe, however, it will pay in the long
run.
"The handling of their wheels, of
course, occasions some inconvenience, but
we are very willing to put up with it and
have no intention of imposing a charge
upon wheelmen."
Mr. Stetson is also president of the Cali
fornia-street Cable Company, and he de
clares that road is the only one in the
City which carries bicycles. He has in
structed his men to allow patrons to bring
their wheels aboard and collect no fare for
them.
The fight which the local wheelmen in
tend to make has been waged bitterly
throughout the East. The League of
American Wheelmen's Journal recently
printed a list of 133 roads which had been
prevailed upon to carry wheels free.
