San Francisco's Fourtii of July Celebrated
in Loyal Fashion â Oup Patriotic City
is True to He? .Noble .Motto: "Opo en
Paz; en Sueppa, Fieppo."
FOURTH OF JULY celebrations in
San Francisco are always spirited.
The present year yields an ex
cellent illustration of the earnest
patriotism of our people. All
citizens join . ladly in paying homage
to the anniversary of the Nation's birth
day. Thus has it been since the founda
tion of this magnificent metropolis.
Thus will it continue while the City â 
stands. The legend on our municipal j
escutcheon is truly and nobly emblematic, j
In peace, we have gold for our beloved
country. In war, we have steel for ncr
iocs.
The people of the Golden Gate never do
anything by halves. The celebration of
the Fourth of July of 1896 was no excep
tion to this characteristic. It was com
plete and enthusiastic. It had more flags
and tri-colored bunting and cheers and
red fire than ever before.
The parade was as spectacular as any
Fourth of July parade that has marched
with rife and drum and bugle and become
silent in the years gone by.
Market street presented a canopy of
fluttering flags, tri-coJored bunting, bril
liant lumerns and pictures of Presidents
and patriots upheld by wires. The store
fronts were, in many instances, almost
covered by National colors.
The principal streets and resorts were
packed with people all day long and far
into the night. During the parade the
crowd was so dense that passage along the
streets and sidewalks was almost impossi
ble except for those in the parade. The
decorations extended from the foot of
Market street almost up to Van Ness ave
nue.on Kearny street almost down to Clay,
and on Geary, OTarrell, Grant avenue,
Post, Sntter and other streets for blocks
away from Market. Streaming proudly
through it all the flag of one nation only
was visibleâ the stars and itripes. The '
tunes that the bands played oftenest were
the "Star-spangled Banner," "Yankee
Doodle," "Hail Columbia" and "Amer
ica." The patriotism displayed was for
one flae and one country.
The chief interest in the day's events
was manifested by t;e mass of the people
in the parade. It was a little slow in be
ginning to move, but when it finally got
under way it moved majestically. His
was a dry heart, indeed, which did not j
Bwell at the spectacle. Up Market street I
it marched, an army carrying waving
plumes and fluttering flags.
Above the spectators in the streets the
windows and roofs of the tall buildings
were filled with faces. Nobod3 r seemed to
care very much if a cannon-cracker
dropped by the Ã¼biquitous small boy went
off under his feet. The greatest good
humor prevailed.
The chief marshals were resplendent in
their uniforms and Fashes. Chief of Po
lice Crowley made a dicnified and fine ap
pearance in uniform.
Mayor Sutro was enthusiastically
cheered. He occasionally bowed his ac
knowledgments from a carriage adorned
with roses and wreaths.
The German societies were often ap

plauded, and particularly so on Kearny |
street.
The parade moved at 10:35, and it took
an hour for it to pass a given point. It
was about two and a half miles long.
All the floats attracted admiration.
Many hats went oft to the queens,
Goddess of Liberty, "California' 1 and
others.
The model of the battle-ship Oregon, in
miniature, on a float, with a brindle dog '
for a mascot, was greatly admired. In- !
terest was intensified when it was seen !
to belch fire, smoke and the noise of war
from genuine little guns, which pro
truded from the turrets just as the big
guns do on the real Oregon down in the
bay getting her finishing touches. The
guns were elevated at an angle above the !
crowds of people in the streets, and on "
this account, though the charges were
strong enough to make plenty of noise,
only one man was hurt. But this was
not owing to any fault in the guns or I
gunner.
t-alvator Vincent of Napa street wan
standing on the corner of Market and !
Montgomery streets watching the parade, j
A flash from one of the miniature guns of <
the model of the battle-ship Oregon set
fire to one of the Mags on the float. Vin
cent sprang forward to tear down the j
burning flag, when another gun went off !
and the wadding penetrated his right arm,
inflicting an ugly wound. He was taken
to the Receiving Hospital, where his
wounded arm was attended to.
People began to crane their necks when
the waving red, white and blue pampas ,
plumes of the hundreds of members of the :
Junior Order of United American Me
chanics came into sight. They were fol- \
lowed by that well-known emblem of pa- j
triotism, "the little - red schoolhouse,"
and both were frequently and enthusias
tically applauded along the line of march. :
The members of the Japanese battalion, ;
witn their unique uniforms, their how- ]
itzer and carrying the beautiful cherry i
blossoms, afforded one of the most pleas
ing sights of the parade. They were
much admired. In fact, on picturetque
ness, they divided the honors with any
other section ot the procession. The j
Fujiyamas stepped with precision and j
bore themselves with dignity. When the j
howitzer was elevated, with its yawning
mouth threatening the heavens, and it
went off, and there was a spectacle of a
man frantically waving his arms in mid
air, the people wondere<3.
The countermarch on Van Ness avenue j
with tne hill and clouds for a background,
and all the colors and streamers flying in
the breeze, and the scores of bands play
ing, was a most beautiful sight.
The procession was happily free from
any serious accidents or disturbances, and
the spectators spontaneously manifested
their appreciation of the parade as it
moved majestically along the lineof march, j
The small boy dotting in thousands the
brown pavement of the avenue and elud
ing the vigilant policeman was very much
in evidence here, as along the entire line
of march. The Fourth of July is pre

At the intersection of Van Ness avenue
and Market street the observer had an ex
tended view of the military approaching
uj> Market street, and wheeling in long
columns into the broad avenue. The pre
cision of movement of the militia and
their superior soldierly bearing was in
spiring in the extreme. The sun glittered
onthe gold-topped helmets of the men as
they turned and marched upon the smooth
paved boulevard. The swords flashed.
As platoon after platoon advanced further
up the hill toward Post street they rose, it
seemed, out of the farther end to be finally
brought into relief in succession against
the blue stage at the place of the counter
march.
It was in the return from Post street that
the hot sun and long tramp began to tell
on tl:e soldier boys. A private of the First
Regiment, overcome by the heat, was
helped from the ranks near the grand mar
shal's station.
The men of the cruiser Charleston
walked with the tread of those to whom
war is business and necessity. The long
cruise through wind and sun has left its
ruddy mark on their faces. Each man
looked capable of taking the hardest place
on a college football team without any ad
ditiopal training.

THE AUDITORIUM,
CHICAGO, 111., July 4. )
The Teller boom was revived to-day, it is supposed with the
assistance of the gold men who would like to see the Republican from
Colorado at the head of the Democratic ticket, because the strait
laced Democracy in that event would be absolved from their allegi
ance to the party and its nominees.
Boies of lowa appeared at the Palmer House to-day and held a
levee. He had several hundred callers and refused to be interviewed
for the press.
Senator Stephen M. White of California is mentioned as the
most acceptable candidate for the Vice-Presidency, as he would get
the vote of New York for a starter.
It is expected that "Silver Dick" Bland will follow the example
of Mr. Boies and will come here to encourage his friends.
Ex-Governor Pennoyer of Oregon is a candidate for first or
second place on the ticket.
Senator Hill of New York remained in his apartments all day
receiving visitors. He refuseed to say anything for publication.
To-morrow will be a big day. Several thousand uniformed Bland
boomers from Missouri will be here with a dozen brass bands and
the California delegation will hold open house in their quarters at

CHICAGO, 111., July 4.â Tnere may or
may not be some significance in the fact
that with the arrival of Senator Hill and
ex-Senator Whitney of New York Teller
stock went up a few points and his name
was industriously buzzed by convention
speilers around the lobbies and in the dif
ferent headquarters. It may be that the
gold men, finding that their fight is irre
trievably lost, have determined to boom a
Republican for the first place on the Dem
ocratic ticket in order that the stanch
Democracy of the country may be ab
solved from any ties of allegiance to the
party, the heading of the ticket with the
name of a lifelong Republican being equiv
alent in their estimation to a surrender to
all party principles.
There is one memorable instance on
record in which the National Democracy
went outside of its own party and selected
a candidate for the Presidency. That can
didate was a man of unblemished reputa
tion, and one in whom the masses of the
people could be well supposed to place im
plicit confidence. But the members of the
party who had been suckled with the milk
of Democracy on the breasts of Democratic
mothers could not stomach so violent a
departure from political usages, such as
that was, and they repudiated Horace
Greeley at the polls. They felt that it
was an insinuation that within the ranks
of the party at that time no man could be
found sufficiently pure, sufficiently able,
sufficiently great or sufficiently-popular to
carry the standard of Democracy through
the smoke and turmoil of a heated cam-

paign and plant it victoriously on the ram
parts of Washington.
It may be that the shrewd gold men had
such a contingency in their minds when
they covertly threw the weight of their
influence to the Teller boorulet, knowing
that Teller would be the weakest man, for
partisan reasons, whom the Democracy
could select. This suggestion was put
forth as a feeler, but the name of the bolt
ing Republican from Colorado did not
spread through the rank and file like a
prairie fire. On the contrary, it required

considerable pushing to get it through the
crowd.
The Bland boom did not suffer anything
by this little diversion. His is the only
name that is spoken with any degree of
enthusiasm which seems to fit into the
silver niche. The nickname, "Silver Dick,"
has done about as much to make him pop
ular as all the arguments of his advocates.
He is the author of the Bland bill, and
that fact being known to every silver man
in the convention has had its expected ef
fect. Outside of the States which have
favorite sons in the field Bland seems to
be the only candidate in vogue.
At one time to-day I thought that the
Bland boom wobbled just a little bit, and
that was when a postoffice file of delegates
tramped upstairs in what seemed a never
ending procession wearing a rabbit path
on the carpet to the door of Mr. Boies'
room. That foxy old gentleman, in the
guise of an innocent granger, had slipped
into towr. just for a day in order, as his
friends said, to confer with his political
advisers here in the van of battle. He is
to go away to-night. When I opened the
door of his room in the Palmer House this
morning I ran afoul of a very sweet
spoken gentleman who was acting as this
honest old granger's bodyguard. He
drew me aside to one corner of the room,
and, holding me against the wall by the
coat lapel with his left hand, cut great
gashes in the atmosphere with his open
right hand in his most earnest attempts to
impress upon my feeble understanding the
vital fact that Mr. Boies would not talk
politics and would not be interviewed
upon any subject by a newspaper man.
Tnen I stood the bodyguard up against
the wall while I impressed upon his mind
the fact that I had not come for the pur
pose of interviewing Mr. Boies, but that I
desired to press his sunburned, horny
hand and gaze into that guileless face and
upon that noble brow, thatched with the
snows of well-spent years while hoeing
corn on the prairies of lowa.
When 1 handed my card to the candi
date for the Presidency a look of pain
erased the good-humored wrinkles Irom
the corners of his eyes and he cast an et
tv Brute clance at his bodyguard, who re
assured him with a wink. I put the old
gentleman still more at ease by repeating
that I had not come for an interview, not
having a porcine appetite for that which I
could not get, and he smiled upon me
with gratitude. He has a kind face with
a well-formed nose, the point of which has
been whittled down very line and sticks
out very sharply on a horizontal line.
There are smiling wrinkles around his
eyes, and when be smiles otherwise, which
is very often, he displays a very good set
of teetti and his cneeks puff out with mer
riment. He was pleased to say that he
felt in good spirits, that his political pros
pects were bright and that he was going to j
return to his home this evening.
The interview was terminated by the
bodyguard presenting a fat man from
New York in a linen suit. I bad some
difficulty in getting away from the door
through the crowd of people, most of
whom were not delegates, but who wished
to have a talk with and to make them
selves bolid with the man who perchance
by a happy turn of fortune's wheel may
become President or Vice-President of this
great county, with a whole lot of post
otiices, consulships and other lucrative
offices at bis disposal.
"Yes," I overheard a man remark in the
New York quarters half an hour later,
"Boies is a nice old fellow and he'd make
a good run, because he has got some hay
seed in his hair. They say he owns a
whole lot of land and that he has callosi
ties on the palms of his hands from cut
ting coupons."
That was all the wobble there was to the
Bland boom, but that will be more than
overcome if the suggestion of some of the
Bland people is adopted, which is to have
Mr. Bland make his appearance here
within a day or two in a casual kind of a
way to confer with some of his principal
advisers. For instance, should he come
here his appearance in the lobby will be
the signal for a great outburst of cheering,
for it cannot be disputed that all the per
sonal magnetism which will affect this
silver convention is baioes around the
crown of "Silver Dick" of Missouri.
David Bennet Hill spent the glorious
Fourth In his rooms in the Palmer House
receiving his friends, and it was a very
hard day's work indeed. Every man who
visited him seemed to have things of the
utmost importance upon which to consult
him. There were bo many callers and
the Interviews were so prolonged that I
was obliged to wait for almost an hour
before I was ushered into the presence of
this well-known etatesman. As I sat in
front of the open door of the inner room
in which Senator Hill received his visitors
I had a very good view of him and
was able to form a tolerably good idea of
his mental make-up. He has one of the
finest heads I ever saw upon a man. His
dome of thought rises grandly above dis
*yes and sweeps back in a symmetrical
curve to a point behind the middle of his
ears, where it reaches a semicircle of brown
hair, the whole crown of his head being
perfectly bald. There are no lumps, knots
or gulches in it. It is full and rounded, and
from a phrenological standpoint denotes
a well-balanced mind. The Senator's eyes
are of a very light blue or gray, so light
indeed that at times as he turned his face
toward the window there seemed to be no
color in them. They are rather deeply set
beneath a pair of very tbin, straight eye
brows and rather close together. His
glance is quick and shifting, like his move
ments and cestures, and he gave me the
impression that he was a man of more
than ordinary guile and cunning. His
countenance does not belie him, for his
record is that of a shrewd political strate
gist, one of those man who are most dan
gerous in their moments of defeat, for if
they get only half an opening they are
likely to reverse the victory.
His next most striking facial character
istic is the rotundity of his cheeks. They
remind one of the pauncbed cheeks of the
gray squirrel which whisks its bushy tail
in the redwood trees of California. When
I was introduced to Senator Hill he/re
marked in a deep basso voice that he
would be very happy to give an interview
to the San Francisco Call, but that he bad
made up bis mind before he came here
not to grant any interviews to any news
paper men. Glancing at an anxious group
of six or eight New York newspaper cor
respondents he remarked with a comical
expression of the eyes that he would re
serve all his interviews "for the New York
boys." The boys smiled, but somewhat
sadly, because they wanted the interview
then and there. One of them had pre
ceded me, and his seemed to be a desper
ate case. He wore a Vandyke mus
tache and beard, closely trimmed,
and was fashionably dressed for trop
ical weather in a black alpaca sack
coat, a biue-striped neglige Bhirt,
with turn-down collar, pantaloons of
CTeam-colored flannel striped lengthwise
with black, and ye Gods! a pair oi white
kid, laced, razor-toed shoes. He sat with
his back to me, facing Senator Hill, who
was also sitting, and made most tremen
dous gestures, smashing his clenched right
hand into the palm of his left and speak
ing most earnestly. He was asking the
Senator, no doubt, to place his heart upon
his sleeve for newspaper men to peck at.
But the Senator did not have any heart
to spare for exhibition purposes, and as
he rose from his chair to summon the
next person in waiting, which was my
self, the man with the sandy beard placed
both hands upon the Senator's hips and
tugged at his coat while imploring him
to grant him the desired scoop for his
paper. I was rather pleased than other
wise to behold the gentleman partaking of
the same kind of soup that I knew would
be dealt out to me when it came my turn.
Hill and Wtitaey are here to make his
tory. They are history-makers, and what
they will do and say between now and
next Thursday will ecno through this Na
tion for many and many a year to come.
Like all their colleagues they are gold men
first and Democrats afterward, if this con
vention may be called Democratic, but that
proposition is disputed.
This gathering is not admitted by them
to be what its name implies. On the con
trary, echoing tbe sentiment of Congress
man Bynum, as published in this morn
ing's Call, they declare that this is a sil
ver convention dominated by Republicans,
Populists and owners of silver mines. This
declaration is an open road to the future
repudiation by the sound-money Dem
ocracy of the action and the candidates of
this convention. From the temper of the
sound-money Democrats here no other
conclusion can be reached than that
Bynum's prediction will be fulfilled.
"This convention will put forth a silver
platform and silver candidates, and that is
as far as it will eet."
There is a little boom, which has been
stirring for several days and growing a lit
tle stronger every day, in favor of United
States Senator Stephen M. White of Cali
fornia. His name was mentioned at first
by few delegates who knew and ad
mired him for his sterling integrity, his
unsurpassed ability and his uncompromis
ing Democracy, as an available candidate
for the Vice-Presidency.
To-day I heard his name whispered about
in the New York headquarters as a Uemo
crat whose name at the head of the ticket
would attract more followers from among
the conservative as well as the radical wing
of the Democratic party than any one of
the persons already named. The New
YorK delegate who spoke to me of Senator
White in approval of his availability as the
Presidential nominee would not allow me
to publish his name as the author of that
statement, but he intimated to me rather
strongly that if Senator White would con
sent to make th 6 race the New York dele
gation would cast its solid vote for him, as
he would be more acceptable to the sound
money men than any of the other silver
men yet known.
The headquarters of the California dele
gation at the Sherman House are being
lavishly and patriotically decorated with
Hags and bunting. Some of its members
are expected here this evening and the re
mainder to-morrow. There seems to be a
ciarm about everything Californian for
Eastern and Western people, whether it be
the visit of California Knights Templar or
of a political body. When Californians
co abroad they put up everything in style.
Nature with them has been generous, even
to the poorest among them, and they
can't help taking after their mother.
When the Californiana arrive here Gov
ernor Altgeld's grip on the Democracy
will be likely to be loosened.
Sound money headquarters are spring
ing up in the three political hotels, the
Palmer, the Sherman and the Auditorium,
like mushrooms after a shower. The
headquarters in the Palmer House take
up the largest parlors in that hostelry.
Over the doors are thÂ© words, "Sound
Money Headquarters," the letters being
formed of incandescent lamps, winch are
kept blazing day and night, as if defying
the enemy. The Cook County sound
money Democracy opened to-day their
headquarters in the Richelieu on Michi
gan avenne, facing the laKe. They oc
enpy the whole of the first floor. The
sound money men also have spacious
headquarters in the Auditorium and the
Shermin, and, judgitig from the large
amount of money that is being expended
for rents, literature, lights and attendants,
the sound money men have not given up
the battle by any means, but are deter
mined to make a desperate fight even in
tbe last ditch.
To-day has not been prolific in new de
velopments. The weather was oppres
iveiy sultry this morning and visitors per
spired at the rate of a gallon an hour, so
that many of the delegates stole away
from the city.
Tempted by the gentle breezes wafted
from the lake of biue, whose surface was
dotted with white sails of small craft,
gleaming against the background of gray
hsze, which covered the eastern horizon,
the steamers plying from the foot of Van
Buren streets to the bathing resorts and
soft-drink cafes of Manhattan and Wind
sor Park beaches were crowded with poli
ticians and pretty girls enjoying the cool
ing breeze caused by the motion of the
steamer and escaping from the heated
streets and firecracker turmoil of a Chi
cago Fourth of July. The martyrs who
remained behind were Senator Hill and the
other big guns of politics whom climatic
conditions can never snake disloyal to
work which is in hand. There were other
martyrs who looked upon the cool sea and
saw with longing the fluttering ribbons
and gay flags on tbe steamers' decks.
These, too, had work in hand and re
mained behind to do it, but with disloyal
hearts and with many a sigh ovi - their
sad fate. They were the Bohemians, who
love nature and who, while despising the
heated brick walls of a great city, must
trudge at the grindstone sighing for their
old love, the shady woods, the green
fields, the babbling brooks, the blue seas
and the gentle airs that make the outdoor
world the Mecca for the hand that is weary
and the spirit that fain would rest.
The latest is that Colorado will with
draw Teller and support Bland.

BLAND HAS THE SWING.
His Boom Little Shaken by the Ar-
rival of Farmer Bolea at
Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., July 4.â Farmer Boies,
who has been looking after his corn crop
in lowa, laid aside the hoe and came to
town to-day. He came to Chicago to fence
in his Presidential boom. Boies got in
Â»arly this morning, and after shaking the
hayseed out of his hair he went into secret
souncil with his managers. His arrival,
)f course, had some effect upon the situa
tion. There was a noticeable increase of
enthusiasm in favor of the lowa states
man, while the Bland boom was ham
mered with unrelenting vigor.
Mr. Boies wonld not discuss the chances
for his nomination. He feels confident of
victory. He will talk with the delegates
personally and will make a strenuous ef
fort to check the onslaught of the labor
element
Circulars have been issued setting forth
his views upon labor questions and re
siting paragraphs from his famous speech,
n which he upheld the position of Presi
dent Cleveland in sending armed troops
to quell the riots caused by the great rail
road strike in Chicago in 1894. Mr. Boies
will also talK with the labor leaders and

attacks on him. He expects to return
home to-morrow.
The arrival of the lowan created a slight
flurry at the headcenter of the Bland
movement. It was soon dissipated, how
ever. As the day wore along the Bland
forces recovered from the shock, and to
night are as gamy as ever. It was
rumored that Mr. Bland himself would
arrive in the morning. I inquired at head
quarters as to the foundation of this story,
and found that Mr. Bland was still engaged
gathering his hay crop on his farm at
Lebanon, and would thus be occupied
until long after the Democratic conven
tion bad selected its Presidential candi
date, and the delegates had scattered to
their homes. Tne fact is that, while the
Bland boom showed indications of weak
ness on the surface, its foundation walls
were unshaken.
Besides the caucus of the Illinois dele
gation, which was held during the day,
demonstrated that Bland was |the favorite
Illinois will vote as a unit. This gives the
Missourian a great lead. His managers
are confident that by Tuesday morning all
the silver States will have declared for him.
One tall, lanky delegate from "Mizzury"
said that everything was over but the
shouting, and he went off on the still hunt
to find a long-haired poet capable of writ
ing a few stanzas of a new and original
battle-cry for freedom.
"There is no question that Mr. Bland
will be nominated," said Mr. Stone to me
to-day. "He may not succeed on the first
ballot, but will win out in the end. There
is no question about it. We are not the
least bit alarmed over the little demonstra
tion of Teller. He is a eood man, but tbe
sentiment of the majority of the delegates
is undoubtedly for Bland. We can safely
say that Bland is the man of the hour."
"I have no doubt but that by the time
the States are called for a ballot on candi
dates for President," said Senator Farras
of Missouri, the Hanna of the Bland boom,
"there will be only one man in the
country, and that man will be Bland of
Missouri. The majority of the Western
States have already united upon him. I
do not rezard the Teller boom seriously.
It is already on the wane. It was only a
Fourth of July firecracker after all. This
is a Democratic convention. Mr. Teller
does not r. present the Democracy. He
only thinks as we do upon one issue and
that is the free and unlimited coinage of
silver at 16 to L"
"^Vhat part will the tariff have in the
coming National campaign?" I inquired
of Senator Farras.
"It will probably take a secondary
place," he replied. '"Democracy believes
in a tariff for revenue only ; that is a rev
enue sufficient to run the Government.
No, the revenue at present does not seem
to be sufficient to run the Government,
and the convention may declare for an in
crease of duties on some articles of im
portation. That, however, is a matter
which I am not prepared to discuss at this
time."
The boom of Pennoyer, which has been
locked up in a glass-case at the Palmer
House, was unpacked to-day. Life-size
lithographs of the Webfoot statesman were
strung about the corridor beneath pictures
of Boies of lowa, Bland of Missouri, Mat
thews of Indiana and Patterson of Penn
sylvania. When the pictures were hung
up Dr. Mullineux, a delegate from Oregon,
a man with a large frame and loud voice,
forced his way through the seething mass
of humanity in the lobby, and shouted
long and loud for his candidate for
the Presidency: "Rah, Rah! P-E-N-
N-O-Y-E-R."
The cry was taken up by the other en
thusiasts of the Oregonian, and for more
than an hour the name of the distin
guished ex-Governor rang throughout the
hotel.
"Look at him," shouted the Oregonians
in one voice: "he is the peer of them all.
TaKe down those other pictures; they are
the pictures of boys compared to him. He
is born to lead men. Rah ! rah ! rah 1 Pen
noyer.
The sound-money men do not seem to
be making many converts to their cause.
They are making a desperate fight. All
the big gold leaders of the country are
arriving on every train. The scene about
the headquarters of the Palmer House to
day was one of great excitement and
numerous conferences were being held.
Whitney and Hill were busy all day mar
shaling their men into line. Senator
Vest of Missouri was early on the scene.
Don M. Dickinson took a lively interest in
the events of the day. President James
J. Hill of the Great Northern Railway con
tributed his energies to the task of gather
ing in recruits for the gold army. The
gold men say that they will accept no
compromise. They will fight the ."silver
men to a finish. The monster demonstra
tion of the gold men to-night was ad
dressed by all the leaders of that wing of
the party. The silver men are, however,
holding the key to the situation, and will
probably unlock the door to the Coliseum
next Tuesday morning.

PROTECTION AND SILVER.
J-udge Powers Tells of the Stand of
the Utah Delegation
at Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., July 4.â Wnen the star
of Utah was placed on the flag at noon to
day, matting the forty-fifth State in the
Union there was ereat rejoicing at the
headquarters at the delegation in the
.f aimer House.
Many who had labored incessantly for
the elevation of Utah to the sisterhood of
States were present. They congratulated
each other upon the fulfillment of their
mission. They were happy in the thought
that their work was done. They gloried
in the knowledge that a new epoch had
opened in the history of their State.
There was no talk of race prejudices, no
word of religious reproach. AH united
with hearty enthusiasm in hailing the
dawn of a new and better day m the life
of the people of Utah.
The headquarters have been handsomely
draped with National colors, and pictures
of noted statesmen and history-makers ot
the country hang upon the walls. Judge
O. W. Powers, chairman of the delegation,
received me cordially when I called upon
him this afternoon. He talked free silver
and protective tariff. He has already pre
pared the tariff plank which he would like
to have inserted in the Democratic plat
form. It reads as follows:
"We favor the imposition of duties to
meet the demands of the Government for
revenues, such revenues to be adjusted so
as to operate equally throughout the conn
try and not discriminate between classes
or sections."
In other words Judge Powers and the
delegates in Utah want the mining, milling
and manufacturing industries of the West
protected as well as those in the East. He
wants to have the woolen manufacturer
of New England protected against the
cheap European importations as well as
the lead and copper producer of the RocKy
Mountains. The tariff nlank which Judge
Powers suggests is taken from the old
Walker platform of 1840.
It is believed that if it is adopted by the
convention the followers of Senator Teller
and a great many Republicans would be
more inclined to vote the Democratic
ticket with the free silver platform than
they otherwise would; at least this is the
idea of the Utah people. They freely con
fess <hat the platform of 1892 is flavored
too much with free trade to suit the peo
ple of their State. They declare that Pres
ident Cleveland and tbe other Democratic
free-trade leaders have taken their ideas
entirely from thÂ« Atlantic Coast, io the
absolute exclusion of the Pacific Coast's
interests.
"It was Henry Watterson who drafted
the tariff platform of 1892," said Judge
Powers, "aud in a fiery speech before the
Chicago convention at that time suc
ceeded in having it adopted, while it did
not reflect the sentiment of a majority of
the delegates. It favors the Eastern coast
entirely. Now we want a tariff that will
operate more equally throughout the
United States, and that is the object of the
resolution which Utah has prepared and
which Mr. Rawlins, who will be our mem
ber of the committee on platform, will
present at the proper time.
"Who do you lavor as the party candi
date for President?" I inquired.
"Utah is for Bland." replied Judge
Powers," but;any candidate with a sound
silver record will be acceptable."
"How will Teller suit your people?" I
asked.
"Utah will support him loyally," was
tbe answer.
There has been some talk to-day about
Teller and McLean as the ticket. I under
stand that such a combination has been
made. It is quite apparent the Teller
forces are not wasting any time in press
ing forward the merits of their candidates.
Whether or not they have the power to
force a nomination remains to be seen. T.
W. Warn per, a mining man of Utah, who
just arrived from New York where be has
Deen spending the summer, told jne to
day that the sentiment in favor of the
free coinage of silver was growing rapidly
at Gotham.
A circular letter was received at the
Utah headquarters to-day from N, W. Har
ris & Co., bankers, of Chicago. It sets
forth that the firm had loaned out in West
ern securities $110,000,000, and of tnis sum
$481,000 was scattered throughout the State
of Utah. The letter intimated that if a
free silver platform were adopted by the
Chicago convention it would cause a "finan
cial panic and also the clients of the bank
in question â¢vrere aiding to bring it about.
The Utah delegates, however, were in no
way disturbed by this prediction. They
will continue the fight for free silver. And
the present creditors of the State now bo
happy in its new suit of clothes don't
want to play in its back yard if there are
thought to be others that do.

IN CONCILIATORY SPIRIT.
William C. Whitney Wants the Fight
to Be on Mild and Per
suasive Lines. j
CHICAGO, 111., July 4.â Some of Mr.
Whitney's friends say he has been placed
in a false position by overz?alous support
ers of the gold standard. One of the most
prominent of the men who accompanied
Mr. Whitney to Chicago said to-day that
Mr. Whitney did not come here to be ag
gressive, but came in a conciliatory spirit.
He wanted his fight to be one of mildness
and persuasion, and did not desire the
prominence which he has attained as the
leader of the forces opposed to the adop
tion of a straightout silver platform.
"Mr. Whitney feels somewhat annoyed
by the false position in which he has been
placed," said this gentleman. "He wants
to bring about harmony by mild persua
siveness, and not by an aggressive fight
against the silver man." - ' -" :
The â Massachusetts people are saying
to-day that George Fred Williams should
not stand as one of the Massachusetts' dele
gates in view of his published interview
snowing a leaning toward silver, and they
may make an effort to get him to with
draw. They base this feeling on the
ground tl at Mr. Williams was selected by
a convention that declared in favor of the
gold standard, and he therefore does not
represent the feeling of the Democracy of
the State.

SOME FAVOR A BOLT.
Sound-Money Men Not Yet Decided
as to Their Course In the
Convention.
CHICAGO, 111., July 4.â The question
of a bolt by the gold men is engaging a
great deal of attention and is the principal
theme of discussion about some of the
sound-money headquarters. At present it
does not appear that there will be any gen
eral movement in that direction, as each
State will act in accordance with the views
of the members of the delegation thereof.
In Illinois there is every indication of a
purpose to put a gold ticket in the field.
The Cook County sound-money Democrats
held a convention some days ago and
nominated a county ticket, at the same
time electing delegates to a State conven
tion, which will be called after the Na
tional Convention shall have finished its
business and the condition of affairs then
known.
The reports were current to the effect
that some members of the Illinois delega
tion havo revolted agaiust Altgold's domi
nation and will refuse to be bound by his
directions. Friends of the Governor, how
ever, smile at these reports and say the
delegation will do as it has heretofore
done, register the Governor's wishes with
out question and without division.
John T. Dye of Indianapolis, general at
torney of the Big Four Railroad Com
pany, one of the committee of sound
money men from Indiana, now on the
field, says he sees no other course for the
onponents of the free-silver idea to pursue
than to bolt the platform and nominee.
"1 take no stock in the proposition to
make no opposition in the convention to
the action of the majority. To do so binds
us to inaction during the campaign. No
benefit can come to the cause of sound
money by the adoption of that policy."
SENATOR JONES' LETTER.
In Preparing the Silver Campaign
He Will Be Guided by the
Majority.
CHICAGO. 111., July 4.â Senator J. K.
Jones of Arkansas, chairman of the steer
ing committee, to whom has been confided
the preparation of the silver men's plan of
campaign, this afternoon sent to the
leaders of the silver delegations this letter:
Chicago, 111., July 4.
Dear Sir: We would be glad to know if
your delegation agrees with us in the convic
tion that the best interests of the cause we all
have a (heart would be advanced by having
the p lat form and nominations practically de
termined by the silver men of the country.
Please let me know at the earliest possible
moment if your delegation agrees in this
movement. Very truly yours,
Jambs K. Jokes.
Senator Jones will bo euided as to his
course in calling a general conference of
silver men by the way the majority
answer.
Altgreld Returns.
CHICAGO, 111., July 4.â Governor Alt
geld returned to the scene of political strife
to-day irom his official home at Spring
field, where he has been for two days re
cuperating from the enervating; effects of
the preliminary skirmish. He was non
commital in speaking of the chairman
ships and Presidential preferences of the
Illinoisans.

SOME ADVICE.
Congressman Maguire Sends to "The
Call" the Views of Some of
the Delegation.
MISSOURI VALLEY, lowa., July 4.â
Our train became unwieldy and was di
vided at daylight this morning into two
sections, both of which are rolling at the
rate of fifty miles an hour through the
beautiful and fruitful valley of the North
Platte toward Chicago.
It is the Fourth of July and the towns
along the road are paily decorated with
flues and bunting. The people are poor,
but patriotic Most of them will never be
able to pay the mortgages that encumber
their homes, but they are still self-reliant
and even hopeful. Their crops are fine
this year, but they complain that none of
their abundant product will command any
money. They see the strong arm of the
Government exerted to limit both the
kind and the volume of the people's
money, and in their distress they cry out
for the removal of the limitation.
They are looking to Chicago as the
mecca of their temporal salvation. They
seem to regard our gathering there aa
something more than a Democratic
National Conventionâ as a sort of con
ference for the defense of popular rights
against the aggressions of the gold mon
opolifcts.
Though a majority of those who meet
us at the depots are not Democrats, they
do not hesitate to advise ua as to our
course at Chicago. A majority of them
are for Teller, many for Bland, but all are
for the free and unlimited coinage of
silver. At Lexington, Xebr., some practical
joker had circulated the report that
Senator Teller was on our train, and upon
our arrival we found a Jar*e gathering of
the people waiting to greet him. In reply
to their repeated calls, Mr. Dwyer and I
assured them that Teller was not on
board. They were disappointed, but good
naturedly advised us to vote for him in
Chicago. One old gentleman, who told 113
that he was a Republican-P pulist, said:
"It don't matter w; at good silver man
you nominate, let us all try and put a
stop to the control of our money system by
the Morgan syndicate. It has demon
strated its control not only of all available
gold, but of ihe greenback currency also."
Mr. McDaniel of the Rait Lake Herald
took a straw ballot on the train last night,
resulting: Bland 50, Teller 30, White
26, Whitney 8, Boies 8, and a number
scattering, one vote being cast for Cleve
land. The California delegation voted for
White and the Utan and Idaho delega
tions for Bland. Most of the delegates ab
stained from political discussion to-day.
Mr. Dwyer said :
"When I left California I had formed no
choice for the Presidential nominee, other
than that he should be a man who could
stand honestly and consistently on the
platform. It is a foregone conclusion that
the platform and the candidate will be for
silver at 16 to L lam beginning to feel
that the choice of the convention will ulti
mately fail on either Boies of lowa or Mat
thews of Indiana. lam personally await
ing our arrival at Chicago before
making up my mind. 1 would
like to see the California delegation
combine on the man that seems to have
the most solid backing in the tier or
States comprising Ohio, Indiana, Illinois
and the Northwest, because this, I think,
is where the fighting will be the hottest in
November, and where the Democracy must
win or lose. Boies has an advantage over
Matthews in having a more extended Na
tional reputation, but the latter offsets
this by the fact that Indiana, being a
closer State than lowa and more neces
sary to Democratic success, would be more
likely to be won by Matthews than by any
body else."
Dr. D. F. Ragan, who has heretofore
been reticent, was quite enthusiastic to
day. He said :
"I regard the coming gathering of the
Democratic clans at Chicago as a memor
able one, one that will not be eclipsed by
the epoch-making convention of 1860.
Great and vital issues are at stake. The
people's interest in the question is
thoroughly aroused, and by a common
impulse the masses are moved to raise
aloft the banner of silver and throw down
the gauntlet at Chicago to the moneyed
class, whom they regard as their enemies
in advocating thÂ» single gold standard.
The issue of 1860 was not more vital than
this, and as the seeds of that great issue
were sown long before the battle was
waged so the present issue is not
a sudden outbreak, bnt the calmination
of a series of attacks long since
inaugurated against the white metal. The
Democracy is characterized as silver mad,
but it seems, indeed, as if there is a method
in its madness. As the party of the people,
it has interpreted the people's wants and
proceeds to give them such relief as they
demand â the free and unlimited and inde
pendent coinage of silver at the ratio of 16
to 1. This is to be the main plank in the
platform. It makes no difference whether
UDon auch a plank we place Bland, Boies,
Slbiey or Stevenson, the Democracy will
win in November."
The delegation will meet to-morrow af
ternoon in the Great Northern Hotel, Chi
cago. James G. Magthre.
SELECTING A CHAIRMAN.
All the Sliver Leaders Will Agree
Upon a Man to Preside Over
the Convention.
CHICAGO, 111., July 4.â The silver
forces devoted themselves this morning to
conferring with each other as to who
would be the most acceptable man among
them to present for temporary chairman.
j The silver men did not meet in formal
conference, but Senators Jones and Har
ris, Governor Altgeld and other leaders
held a meeting and sent for the leaders
of the silver men in the respective delega
tions and discussed with them, separately,
the merits of the various persons men
tioned in connection with the temporary
chairmanship of the convention. Among
the names thus canvassed were those of
Charles S. Thomas of Colorado, H. D.
Money of Mississippi, Senator Harris of
Tennessee and J. D. Richardson of Ten
nessee.
Mr. Thomas is developing more strength
than any of the men named, and as he is a
member of the National Democratic Com
mittee it is claimed by his supporters that
he way receive the indorsement of his
fellow members on personal grounds.
After the Jonea silver committee shall
have learned the consensus of opinion of
the silver men, it is the intention to ac
quaint the silverites on the National Com
mittee with the selection of the silver
forces for temporary chairman, and an
nounce that their man will receive the
solid support of the silverites, under
authority conferred by the first silver con
ference and reaffirmed by yesterday's
meeting. The Jones sub-committee has
entire charge of the matter, and can rec
ommend the temporary chairman without
calling for a further conference. The sub
committee will, however, be puided in its
selection of a temporary chairman solely
Dy the degree of unanimity which the sil
ver leaders and delegates express for any
one man. In case of pronounced division
of sentiment in the matter a further con
ferenca will be held. The names and ad
dresses of the leaders in each delegation
are in possession of Chairman Jones, and
a conference can be assembled within an
hour's notice.
TELLER TALKS MILDLY.
Would Vote for Bland or Boles or
Even Stevenson for the
Presidency.
DENVER, Colo., July 4.â Senator Tel
ler passed most of the day in his office re
plying to his more important letters. He
does not wish at this time to submit to a
formal interview, but to the United Press
correspondent in a confidential talk he ex
pressed himself clearly and positively
upon several phases of the political situa
tion.
"The people of the country," said he,
"need have no fear of the position of the
Republicans who left the tit. Louis con
j vention. Neither McKinley nor the plat
form there adopted can claim any one of
us at any time. If we don't get what we
want in Chicago we shall go to St. Louis,
and, failing there, we will be like many
other men of the country â we will not
vote at ail. It is preposterous to talk of
protection with snch a 'platform as that
made by the St. Louis convention. Why,
I would rather vote a free trade ticket
than that. You simply cannot get protec
tion on a gold platform. No, there is no
doubt about the loyalty of the friends of
silver and bimetallism who left the St.
Louis convention. We shall support the
Democratic ticket if it gives us a clear
platform and an undoubted silver candi
date, aud I expect to do some talking in
j California and down East as far as Illinois
for our cause in any event.
"We are uniting all over the Nation for
Americanism and American ideas. I have
no patience with men who think we can
not establish an independent financial
policy as well as an independent political
policy. We don't ask England to dictate
our political ideas, and why should we in
financial matters? I have been asked to
speak at the dedicatory exercises of the
Eisteddfod Pavilion to-night, and I had
expected to say only a little and nothing
of a political nature, but thinking over the
subject to-day I have concluded that it
might be well to take advantage of this
National holiday to touch up the people
to a desire for a little more Americanism.
We need more of the spirit of independ
ence, more confidence in our great country
and in ourselves. Reaily this is the bot
tom of the wtiole controversy. Are we an
independent people V,
"I would prefer not to talk about the
Chicago situation," he replied to a query,
and with a smile added: "It's rather em
barrassing just now. I don't want to say
a word thatmigbt embarrass the stanch
friends of mine there whose soie ambition
is to secure the return of bimetallism. So
far as I am personally concerned, I could
willingly vote for Bland. I could vote for
Boies."
"How about Stevenson?"
"Stevenson is all right on the silver
question. He is a good man but very
modest. Had he come out six months ago
and declared his candidacy no power on
earth could have prevented his nomina
tion. But he held back because Morrison,
from the same State, was out for the Pres
idency, and modestly deferred to another
Democrat from his own State."
"Would you vote for Stevenson?"
"Yes, for his silver views are sound, but
it is not candidates we are lighting for, it

Headquarters U>ttep Preps, 1
Herald Bttilding, r
Chicago, 111., July 4.)
The climax of to-day's ante-conventional
developments was the mass-meeting of tin
gold men in the Auditorium this evening.
The speeches of ex-Governor Russell oi
Massachusetts, Senator Gray of Deiawar.
and District Attorney Fellows of New
York wer â¢ vigorous enough in their de
nunciation of the line of action which Ihe
convention is bent on taking on the silver
question, but they stopped short of sug
gesting a remedy or any plan by which
the "sound money" advocates could bop>
to stem the current. now setting sostrongiy
against them.
Governor Russell's remarks particularly
brought out in strong relief the difficulty
â  which is beginning to loom before the sil
ver managersâ what to do with the tariff.
Nearly all the bolting Republican dele
gates at St. Louis declared that their State
were solid for tree silver and protection.
Oovernor Russell seized upon this point
and asserted that if Republican protection
â wa= ri<;ht in principle then silver legisla
tion wa? equally so; but if protection was
wrong in principle, unlawful and op
pressive in practice, as the Democratic
party had ever declared and still declared,
then silver legislation was equally so and
oucht to receive equally empliatic con
demnation. This point was obviously di
rected against the arguments advanced in
favor of the selection of Senator Teller a?
the free-silver standard-bearer, he being
also an earnest advocate of protection,
and as such its force was appreciated.
The effect will undoubtedly be to aug
ment the perplexities which the managers
are finding in dealing with the tariff plank
of the platform.
The gold men took some courage from
the developments of the clay, and to-night
pxprpÂ«= a confidence that they will re
ceive much more consideration in the
convention at the hands of the silver men
than they had heretofore felt was to be
their portion. Controller Eckels said:
"The silver men have been talking to
day of a desire to secure harmony in the
convention, and several gold men with
whom they have talked tell me that in
their opinion there will be a material mod
ification of the programme that has been
announced by some of the rad'eal silver
men. There will be no attempt to cut off
discussion âno single-day convention,
based upon the idea that only silver men
are to take part in its proceedings. They
recosnize, I thirk, that there is an election
to be held befdre the decrees of the conven
tion can be executed. Harmony is what
the; 1 need."
In the constantly changing estimates a<
to the probabilities of success of the va
rious candidates, the boom of the lowa ex-
Governor, Boies, assumed much promi
nence to-day. It transpired in the course
of the day that the telegram which brought
ex-Governor Boies to Chicago was closely
connected with the reported revolt in the
ranks of the Illinois delegation against the
alleged dictatorial policy of Governor Alt
geld. It is asserted that under the leader
ship of Delegate William Prentiss of the
.Seventh Illinois District the support of
thirteen Illinois delegates has been ob
tained for the lowa man.
Some prominent Ohio men this evening
were circulating the statement that John
R. McLean was not to be considered in
the lield for second place. "The ticket
will include John R. McLean," said Beriah
Wilkins, with a significant emphasis, ' 'and
don'i you overlook it."
The action of the Indiana delegation in
refusing to send a representative to the
silver confer* nee at the Sherman House
last night has aroused a feeling of an
tagonism to Governor Matthews' candi
dacy, and has also set afoot a movement
for a caucus of al! the silver forces for
Monday next. This movement is being
pushed by Senator-elect Money of Missis
sippi, ex-Con pressman Casey Young of
Tennessee, National Committeeman
Thomas of Colorado and Delegate Haynes
of Idaho.
They desire to thus agree upon a full
slate of officers and candidates to be voted
for by the silver forces. Delegate Cockran
of Missouri expressed the sentiment of the
extreme silver element when he declared
to-day that for a silvei man to be nomi
nated by aid of ''goldbupÃ" would cast a
'â¢blight upon the ticket and disparage its
nominee in the eyes of true^silver men."
As the power to call a caucus is vested in
Senator Jones and his sub-committee,
preat pressure is brought on the commit
tee. The Matthews people are opposed to
such a programme and are fighting it at
every stage.
With all these diverging interests clash
ing it will readily be perceived that thus
far the securing of the Democratic free sil
ver nomination on this glorious Fourth of
July remains anybody's light
"SOUND MONEYS" FRIEND.
Franklin MacVeagrh and Ex-Gov-
ernor Russell Speak at a
Meeting.
CHICAGO, 111, July 4.â A public meet
inÂ« of the friends of the "sound money' 5
cause was held this evening in the Audi
torium, a theater connected wiih the ho
tel of t! at name and capable of holding
about 7000 spectators. There was not v
vacant seat to be had wwhetn t the serious
business of the evening began, the hour
between 7 and 8 beine; tilled up by select
pieces of music given by the band of the
First Regiment.
On the piatform were seated Senator )
Gray of Delaware, John R. Fellows of
Nt-w York, Franklin MacVeagh of Chicago
and many other prominent supporters of
the sound money cause and a mrge num
ber of ladies, while Mr. W T hitney occupied
a seat in one of the boxes.
The meeting was called to orde^ by ex-
Governor Flower of New York, who, after
a short speech, introduced as tbe first
speaker Mr. Franklin MacVeagh as "the
prominent financier of Chicago."
Mr. MacVeagh said this great assem
blage had gathered because the Nation
and the Democratic party were brought
face to face with an impending crisis.
Thirty-six years agoâ in 1860 â a memora
ble Democratic convention had met.
Then also the Nation and the Democratic
party stood face to face with an impend
ing crisis. Then the unity of the Nation
was at stake. Now its honor is at
stake. That honor had to be pre
served. The agonies and waste of war,
North and South, would turn to wanton
ness in the pages of the Nation's history,
if the country should have been preserved
only to become a defaulter and to pay its
debts with frfty-cent dollars. Continuing,
MacVeagh said :
"Many of us are earnest bimetallists,
eager to see silver and gold made equal in
the coinage of our country. That wnich
for this crisis unites bimetallists and gold
monometallfcts is the awful specter of
silver monometallism ; for the free coinage
of silver at 16 to 1 by this Nation alone is
silver monometallism â and by all the un
changeable laws which govern the
economics of nations, it mutt be that and
nothing else. The fact that silver mono
metallists will not argue for silver mono
metallism, but use the arguments of
bimetallism, makes their propaganda
misleading and dangerous; but it does not
change its aims, nor would it change the
dreaded results. We cannot hope to ap
peal with success to all the silver dele
gates. The great body of them would not
iisten to even persuasion. The wild
character of the movement is shown in its
fury and anger. But there must be many
-ilver delegates who find themselves oat
of touch with fury and recklessness, and
who can still be made to see where this
passion and excitement is carrying them
and their party and possibly their country.
To their sober reason this meeting is an
appeal.
"Unless the silver men with conserva
tive tempers intervene, unless those inter
vene whose patriotism Is more precious to
;hem and whose Democracy is more
precious to them than adherence to a
-ingle idea, this majority will sweep the
convention. Where will it sweep to? It
wiil sweep it into hostility with the abid
.ng sentiment of the people â that- senti
uent which is the sinele defense of the
Nation. It will sweep it into hostility
A'ith the .abiding conscience of the Nation
âthat conscience whose sober rigor will
tbate ail sophistries which make against
the honor of the Nation.
"For what will the aim be â what will
the proposition be? To pay the Nation's
debt in 50-cent doiiars. And that is Na
tional dishonor. For quibble as we may
quibble as Horace Boies has lately been
quibblingâ the National debt is payable in
the equivalent of gold. That is the bere
business* fact, backed by the conscience of
dispassionate Americans and the con
science of the worid.
"Silver monometallism means havoc, it
means ruin, it means the prostration of al:
business, all finance, all manufacturing â by
a cyclone of panic. There is but one class of
men who could be benefited. The silver
miner could not be, for he would throw
away for a temporary and irresponsible
outlet in this market all his hopes of that
permanent and responsible outlet which
is only obtainable through the consent of
the leading nations. The farmer would
not be benefited, for if he got a silver
dollar for his 50-cent wheat bis dollars
would be worth only 50 cents. There is,
1 say, but one class who would be bene
fited, and that class was described by Al'
?eld in his speech at Peora when h
spoke openly of himself as a man with a
great deal ol property covered by a great
deal of debt.
"It will defeat the Democratic party.
That is the faith of the business world â
and for that faith they thank Heaven daily.
The Democratic party can stand defeat in
a worthy cause, if necessary; it can stand
extinction, for it has a glorious history
that will live. What it cannot stand is the
odium of silver monometallism and of pal
tering with the honor of the Nation and
the prosperity of the people.
"If the convention declares for free
coinage at VI to 1 by this Nation alone,
that action will not be Democratic action.
It will be Populistic action. A Democratic
convention may turn Populistic and many
Democrats may turn Populists, but a mil
lion Democrats will remain Democrats.
I No wave of Populism can sweep them off
their feet."
Mr. MacVeagh closed, with introducing
to the meeting as the man who, under
other circumstances, might have been the
Presidential nominee, the Hon. William
E. Russell of Massachusetts. [Cheers.]
Ex Governor Russell then addressed the
meeting as follows:
"We have met on tbe eve of onr National
Convention to take counsel together for
the promotion of the welfare of our party
and our country. We meet with no per
i sonal ambition to serve, with no threat
upon our lips and with no purpose to ques
tion the sincerity or honesty of any Dem
ocrat, however radical the differences
within our ranks; but we are painfully
conscious of the palpable fact that for the
first time within a generation, and for tin*
second time only in its hundred years of
honorable life, the great National Demo
cratic party is on the point of sectional
and geographical division, with its untold
miseries and disasters. The door is open
for derision, defeat, dishonor; we see new
faces and new principles urging us on, but
we have not yet crossed its threshold. May
God save us from the fatal step.
"In a spirit of unflinching loyalty to a
party which for a lifetime has been to
many of us a guiding faith, of deepest
love to our common country for whom all
would give their blood and life, we ask
the representatives of our party to pause
and without prejudice or passion to con
sider well before committing Democracy
to a radical and novel policy which we be
iieve affects our Nation's honor and we
know must break tbe ties which bind South
and North, East and West, together in an
enduring and triumphant Democracy.
'"The glory of our party has been in the
past and ought now and forever to be ite
broad National character. It has been and
is the people's party. Within its ranks
thus far there has been no room, thank
God, for sectional prejudice, prescriptive
bigotry controlled by selfish interests, or
any influence which would divide us on
goographical, religious or class lines.
Rights, not favors; the people, notclatses;
our country, not its sections, are the max
ims of our Democratic creed.
"Has the time come when we are ready
to surrender these the cardinal principles
of our iaith, to reverse the established
policy of our party, to look to a paternal
Government, to add value to any commod
ity in the interest of class or section, and
as the result of such folly to destroy the
National character of a broad and tolerant
i>emocracy? We are not ready to sar

render to Republican protection and throw
that mantle over silver its discarded
shield, nor to abandon our position as the
people's part} r to become, like the Repub
licans, a porty of class and of section.
"For the first time in its history the
Democratic party is urged to make the
cardinal principles of its faith and the
leading issue of its campaign silver mono
metallism â a new and depreciated stan
dard of value. The demand is for free
coinage of silver at 16 to 1, which means
that the power ana lorce of Government
are to be invoked to change our unit of
value and to substitute fifty cents of silver
for a dollar in golJ and then to adjust the
business of tbe country, all wages, earn
ings and savings, all debts and credits, all
public obligations and the National honor
to this depreciated standard. The de
mand comes from a section and a class
and appeals to a paternal government to
give value where none exists. Is this de
mand a sound Democratic principle?
Does it accord with the teaching and
record of our party, with the faith of Jef
ferson and Cleveland, with its unflinching
position always in favor of sound and
hard money, with Us opposition to paper
legal tender and Sherman silver bills, with
its constant, undying enmity against pa
ternalism and protection and its proud
boast of being the people's party, broad
as the Nation, controlled by no class or
section of selfish interest. May the dele
gates here gathered to proclaim our old
Democratic faith put this question to their
consciences before plunging us into heresy
and schism.
"Never yet has this demand been a
plank in any National Democratic plat
form. It was expressly repudiated in the
convention of 1876 and thereafter aban
doned. Three times in twenty years we
have elected a Dem cratic President with
candidate anil platform hostile to such
doctrine, yet cordially supported by a loyal
and united party. If free coinage of silver
is Democratic doctrine it is such doctrine
in the year of our Lord 2896, never in any
year before, nor likely to be in any year
hereafter.
"It is not only a new but a radical de
parture. It destroys our present standard
of value and ends all hope of a bimetallic
standard. No power under heaven has
established and maintained, or ever can, a
bimetallic standard at a ratio where
one coin is given double its intrinsic
value. To make 50 cents of silver
by force of government equal to a dol
lar in gold will, by inexorable laws
of nature, over which government i*
powerless, drive out gold, contract our
currency, depreciate our standard, unset
tle business, impair credit, reduce all
savings and the value of all wages. And
the masses of the people will be the
heaviest losers and tbe greatest sufferers.
Five millions of our people, with nearly
$200,000,000 in our savings banks, will be
paid their claims in a depreciated cur
reÂ»cy; 2,000,000 of our people with life
insurance policies, 3,500,000 who have made
payments to co-operative and frater
nal associations, nearly 7.000,000 of
members of industrial companies â these
and many more, with the millions depend
ent upon them, all will suffer in being
paid in money of less value than they
parted with. And every wage-earner paid
in depreciated money will suffer a reduc
tion of his wages; payment of his present
wages in a 50-cent dollar would reduce
them just one-half. The masses would suf
fer and the great corporations owine these
debts and employers of labor would reap
a benefit at the expense of the people. It
ia the old principle and experience of pro
.ection over again, the power of Govern
ment used to give value and make wealth
for the benefit of the few to the burden
and expense of the many. Surely this
principle has no place in our Democratic
creed.
"This new doctrine, Republican in prin
ciple, is in line with past Republican pol
icy, only just discarded in the hope that
the Democratic party may be deluded into
putting on Republican cast-off clothing.
Only six years ago, coupling protection
with silver, the Republican party passed,
against Democratic protest, the Sherman
law, which soon brought panic and dis
aster, and was repealed upon the unani
j mous demand of the conservative and bus
iness interests of the country. But four
years ago the Nation permitted its free
silver leaders, upon their own confession,
to grant and declare tbe Republican be
lief upon this vital question. Protection
a^ain made its bargain with silver,
deceiving the people with a straddle and
chesting its partner to the trade. And
now it has nominated as it? candidate one
..hose record is more shaky even than
Us own, and whose cowardly silence is
ominous to future trade and commerce.
Can our party of to-day with any sincerity
or jpon any Democratic principle follow
ii these Republican footsteps? Can it
'. ope for any success in repudiating its
i-Tti honorable record? Can it even main
tain its honor and its life in this depart
ure from its own faith?
"May I in closing say a word of the po
litical results? lam not here to utter any
threat of any section of our party. But I
state an evident fact when I say that if
our party takes this false step it will lose
much of its National character, abandon
some of Us great principles and there will
be thousands and tens, yes, hundreds of
thousands of its old soldiers" who cannot
follow it as it pursues its will o' the wisp
under its new and radical leaders. As a
Northern and National Democrat I
implore our brethren in the West
and South, by whose side we would love
to fight, whose principles we have jointly
held, for whose interests we have labored
and suffered and in whose victories we
have done our part, 1 implore them to
save our party from a course which will
rudely break tbe closest ties and send us,
divided and discredited, to a great and
lasting defeat."
Mr. Russell was frequently applauded.
When Jttr. Russell resumed his seat,
amid much cheering, Mr. MacVeagh intro
duced to the audience Senator Gray of
Delaware. Senator Gray defined the meet
ing as a protest against the promulgation
of a dangerous heresy and a departure
from the ancient faith of the Democratic
party. He said there was not a silver
standard country in the world to-day
where the laboring man received fair pay
for a day's work.
When Gray concluded there were loud
calls for Senator Hill. Mr. MacVeagh,
however, informed the audience that Sen
ator Hill was not in the hall. He intro
duced Colonel John R. Fellows of New
York, and at tbe close of his speech (11
p. m.) the meeting was declared adjourned.

Teller's Policy as to Coinage Indorsed
by the Leaders of the Con*

DENVER, Colo., July 4.â The State
Convention of the People's party, held at
the Broadway Theater to-day, selected a
delegation to the % St. Louis convention
that will favor a union of all silver forces,
while maintaining the party organization
and platform. They will work to secure
an indorsement of the Democratic party
nominee in Chicago if he is known to be a
free silver 16 to 1 man. The complexion
of the delegation is such as to secure the
councils and advice of Senator Henry M.
Teller, whose wishes will be consulted be
fore the delegation goes to the National
Convention.
The platform, which is short, indorsed
Senator Teller's course as consistent to
tbe last, advised the adoption of a plank
favoring direct legislation and is fully ex
plicit on the financial question, claiming
the glory of the silver issue as coming
f r om the People's party. The platform is
as follows:
Retolved, By the People's party of Colorado,
in convention assembled, that it adheres to the
time-honored principles of the party as here
tofore declared and abates not a particle of its
loyalty to those principles, nor to the grand
organization which has put them forth. We
the Populists of Colorado learn with pleasure
that the great principle of free coinage of sil
ver at the ratio of 16 to 1, declared first by the
People's party, has become the one distinct
ami pronouueed issue of the day, and we in
vite the co-operation of all citizens to the end
that the principle may become a fact em
bodied in tbe statutory law of the land. Real
izing that the settlement of tbe financial
question Is the paramount issue now before the
American people, we favor such action by our
National Convention as will unify the suoport
of all parties upon a candidate for the Presi
dency who is unqualifiedly in favor of the
free and unlimited coinage of gold and silver
at the ratio of 16 to 1, without waiting for the
action of any other nation.
Resolved, That the mission of tbe People's
l>arty has but begun, and that the organiza
tion should be perpetuated, strengthened and
kept intact to the end that the great princi
ples for which it stands shall ultimately tri
umph.
The last two resolutions were eulogistic
of Teller and declaring for the adoption or
the initiative and referendum.
State Chairman Clark, in calling the con
vention to order, made a personal explana
tion in defense of allegations made in a
leaflet distributed in the convention ball
l>y the followers of the AVaite faction in
this (Arapahoe) county, and he did it
humorously, to the evident enjoyment of
the delegates. As the Waite faction were
contesting for seats the chairman request
ed delegates from Arapahoe County to re
train from participating in the preliminary
organization.
W. J. Kerr of Pueblo was made chair
man. After the usual committees were se
lected, while awaiting the result of the
hearing of the committee on credentials
on the Arapahoe County contest, Hon.
Lafe Pence and Judge John H. Bell, mem
ber of Congress from the Second District,
addressed the convention, both urging a
union of all forces upon the financial
question, leaving other Populist ideas
alone until that issue had been settled.
The Populists must go to St. Louis as
patriots and not as partisans, was Judge
Hell's view of the situation.
The credentials committee refused to
seat the Waite delegates by a practically
unanimous vote and no Waite follower
was recognized in the selection of dele
gates. A strong fight was waged against
Mayor Nicholson of Leadville rs delegate
to St. Louis because he was chairman of
the State Convention two years ago which
was ruled by Waite, but Nicholson was
finally named by a large majority vote.
The women delegates held a caucus and
then demanded representation, which was
granted in the Congressional conventions
held later in the day.
Ex-Governor Waite asked to be permit
ted to address the convention, and, alter
considerable opposition, upon an urgent
plea of T. M. Patterson to grant Waite a
hearing be was given the floor. Waite
formally announced a protest to the action
of the convention in refusing his adher
ents seats and he gave notice that an ap
peal would be made in St. Louis. Then
calling upon his friends to follow hin, be
departed to bold a convention downtown,
where delegates to St. Louis were named.
The delegate? at Inrge are T. M. Patter
son, John C. Bell, Myron W. Reed, J. D.
Hooper, C. H. Conant, 8. D. Nicholson,
H. C. Bolsinger, J. H. Voorhees, W. J.
Kerr, H. G. Clark. Twenty delegates from
the Second and fifteen from the First Con
gressional District were also named and
the convention then adjourned.
WANT A FUSION TICKET.
Washlnarton Silverites Offer a Com
bination for Consideration
at Chicago.
SPOKANE, Wash., July 4.â The follow
ing circular, promulgated by the free
silver forces of this State from all parties,
has been issued. Ten thousand copies
were sent to Chicago, where they will be
stamped with the approval of the Wash
ington delegation:
Without a union of all silver forces success
Is impossible. The action of the National Re
publican Convention makes snch a union Im
jossioleand impracticable without sacrifice
of principle. Nominate for President a Demo
crat whose loyalty to the principle of free and
unlimited coinage of god and silver at the
ratio of ltt to 1 is pronounced and unques
tioned. Tender the nomination for Vice-
President to W. V. Allen of Nebraska. He is a
patriot and statesman. Declare by resolution
In favor of John T. Morgan of Alabama for
Secretary of State and in favor of Henry M.
Teller of Colorado for Secretary of the Treas
ury, positions for which they are eminently
fitted. The country venerates them for their
courage, integrity, ability and patriotism.
In this crisis precedent must be subordi
nated to patriotism. This is the way to unite
all forces that are opposed to the single stand
ard, to high-tariff monopoly, to corruption
monopoly, to trusts and other unlawful com
binations. Do this and the ticket will receive
the electoral vote of the following States:
Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Florida. Georgia, Illinois, lowa, Kansas, Ken
tucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Ne
braska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
Utah, Virginia. Washington and Wyoming, a
total of 237, to which will be added three
votes from Michigan districts, mating a total
of 240.
HOLDS A BIG LEVEE.
Governor Altgeld Has Particular
Business With the Illinois
Delegates.
CHICAGO, July 14.â The Chief Magis
trate of Illinois held a reception, political
and private, in his parlor to-day at the
Sherman House. He had more callers, by
appointment or otherwise, than any other
silver Governor or Senator or Congress
man who has his headquarters at that
hotel.
John P. Altgeld had particular business
with his fellow-members of the Illinois
delegation. He wanted to know if their
minds had become crystalized during his
address in Springfield on the all-impor
tant question of their choice of candidate
for President. He absorbed all the infor
mation vouchsafed on that and any other
subject, but said little or nothing in return
as to how be stood, except that be favored
a caucus of all the silver delegates to the
convention.
Illinois delegates were not the only poli
ticians whom Governor Altgeld received
behind closed and carefully guarded doors.
Silver leaders from the North, West and
South passed in and out at frequent inter
vals, and from them the Governor learned
the exact status of the situation to date.
Kepresentatives of all the Presidential can
didates came to see if the Governor would
indicate by word or sign his preferences
Presidentially, but he was cautious to the
point of silence.
Toward the close of the Governor's busy
day he said to a reporter of the United
Press :
"The majority of the Illinois delegates
with whom I have talked to-day are in
clined towards Mr. Bland. A few of them
are for Senator Teller and Mr. Boies, but
they will not count for mnch. I do not
expect much definite development from
to-morrow's caucus of the Illinois dele
gates, but Monday the delegation will get
together again and decide whom to sup
port for Pres ident. I shall do nothing to
influence their discussion, and Mr. Bland
will be as satisfactory to me as any other
candidate if the delegation so wills."
"What will the delegation do toward
meeting a general caucus of the silver
delegates?"
"The delegation will favor the caucus.
The gold men have organized and we
should keep pace with ail their counter
movements. We would get acquainted
with each other in caucus if nothing
more. 1 met delegates from other States,
but they did not tell me who they in
tended to vote for, except that it would be
a 16 to 1 man."
INDIANA ORGANIZED.
Much Opposition to the Re-Elec-
tlon of Secretary Sheerln of
the National Committee.
CHICAGO, 111., July 4.â lndiana's was
the first State delegation to meet for or
ganization, assembling at 3 o'clock this
afternoon in their headquarters, Palmer
House. Senator Turpie presided and was
chosen chairman ot the delegation. Un
usual interest centered in the meeting be
cause it involved the continuance of S. P.
Sheerin, who has been for sixteen years
secretary of the National committee as
the member of that body from Indiana.
Opposition to his re-election developed
for the reason that he is not a free-silver
man and the State delegation is over
whelmingly so. twenty-six to four. Gov
ernor Matthews, it is said, deÃires Mr.
Sheerin's re-election. There were twenty
eight of the thirty members of the dele
gation present at the meeting to-day.
When the selection of National commit
teemen was reached it was voted to post
pone action until Monday.
FOR A GOOD DEMOCRAT.
But Colonel McGraw Is Decidedly
Opposed to the Nomination
of Teller.
WHEELING, W. Va., July 4.â From the
tenor of interviews given out to-nieht by
five of West Virginia's twelve delegates
who left for Chicago to-night, the State
delegation will oppose the nomination of
Teller and the abrogation of the two-thirds
rule. In an interview Colonel McGraw
said:
"I am for tbe nomination of any good
Democrat who suits the logic of the situ
ation. Boies or Stevenson would perhaps
suit me better t an the others. lam op
posed to the nomination of Senator Teller,
for I thinkg a Democratic convention
should nominate a Democrat As to the
two-thirds rule, I don't think it should be
abrogated. It has stood the test of fifty
two years and has become an unwritten
law of the party. 1 don't think Mr. Whit
ney and his Eastern men can stem the
silver tide now. It is too late."
IRISH AND BRYAN DEBATE.
They Debate the Currency Ques-
tion In Eloquent Style at ths
Crate Chautauqua.
LINCOLN, Nebr., July 4.âEx-Congress
man Bryan of Lincoln and Colonel John
P. Irish of California debated the cur
rency question at the Crete Chautauqua
to-day, Mr. Bryan upholding the cause of
silver, while Mr. Irish argued for the gold
standard. There was an immense crowd,
the fame of the two orators Bringing dele
gations from all over the State. Both
speakers were warmly applauded, and
when an incidental reference was made
to Bryan as a possible Presidential candi
date the cheering was prolonged. Each
speaker stoutly maintained his side of the
question, and the arguments advanced
were of suggestions on the leading politi
cal issue of the day. The debate was the
feature of the celebration.
Missouri Delegates Caucus.
CHICAGO, 111., July 4.â At a caucus of
the Missouri delegation to-night Senator
Cockrell was made the member for that
State on the committee on resolutions.
The conference did not adjourn until a
very late hour. Many speeches were made
and plans outlined lor meeting delegates
and Dresenting the claim of Mr. Bland for
tbe nomination. A further meeting will
be held Monday morning, at which the
remaining members of the various conven
tion committees will be agreed upon.
Cady Nominated for Congress.
NORTH PLATTE, Nebb., July 4.â After
an exciting contest of ten hours, A. C.
Cady of St. Paul was late last night~nomi
nated for Congre3S by the Renubticans of
tbe Sixth district. It took forty-three bal
lots to nominate, Judge Aaron Wallace of
LoupCounty being the strong opponent of
the nominee. The platform reiterates the
St. Louis declarations.

DANCING OR DRILL MUSIC
An Argument That Caused a
Lively Row at a New
York Picnic
During the Fighting One Hundred
Persons Were Injured and Sev
eral May Die.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 4.â An argu
ment as to whether dancing music or
drill music should De played at the picnic
of the Independent Order of the Late Sol
diers of Russia, held in Sewell's Park, in i
Maspeth, L. 1., to-day, caased a fight
which resulted in the arrest of fifty-nine of
the members and the probable fatal injury
of two Constables.
It is estimated that 100 persons were
more or less hurt. The organization is di
vided into two factions, the regulars and
the independent?. Both factions were
marching to the picnic attended by their
families and they began to fight just as I
they reached the grounds.
The men took sides with their leaders
1 and a wild conflict ensued. They cut and
slashed each other until Mr. Sewell, pro
prietor of the park, called upon Sheriff
Dohl. The Sheriff summoned fifty depu
ties and hastily sent them to the park.
By the time the officers arrived the ma
jority of the men had gone outside the en
closure. Others were still fighting inside
the gates. The fight waxed hot for nearly
an hour after the deputies arrived. They
arrested a number of men.
Constable Sherry had a very bad stab
wouad in the abdomen, which, it is
thought, will kill him. Officer Bowman
was found to have sustained stab wounds,
but hopes are entertained for his recovery.

brutal assault upon the Buxton family of ,
Gaithersburg, Md., made at their home on
June 25, as a result of which Sadie Bux- I
ton, a nine-year-old daughter, has since
died, was taken from jail at an early hour
this morning by a mob of twenty or thirty
people and hanged.
Randolph protested his innocence and
begged for his life, but his pleas were un
availing. The mob was apparently well
organized and the entire affair was con
ducted quietly and quickly.
The motive for Randolph's assault on
the Buxton family has never been learned,
but it was generally believed that it was
in revenge for Buxton' s testimony in Â»
case against tbe friend of Randolph.

PATRIOTISM IN
TAMMANY HALL,
Politics Waived While the
Stars and Stripes
Wave.
SILVERY SPEECHES MADE
Land of the Free and Home of
the Brave Glorified in
Song.
CLEVELAND'S NOTE OF REGRET.
A "Sound Money" Argument, Which
Is Ably Seconded by Senator
D. B. Hill.
NEW YORK.N. V.. July 4.â The Fourth
of July was a great day in Tammany Hall.
Politics were for the nonce laid aside and
patriotism had the call. The social side of
the Tammany Society, or Columbian
Order, made itself manifest in speech and
song glorifying the land of the free, the
home of tue brave, and silver-toncued ora-
tors were listened to and applauded by an
audience that packed Tammany Hall to
the doors.
Letters of regret were received from
President Cleveland, Senator Davia B.
Hill and others. President Cleveland,
after regretting his inability to be present,
said in his letter:
The situation that confronts the country
ar.d the Democratic part y invests with unusual
Impressiveness this commemoration of our
beginning as a nation. When, ns appropriate
to the occasion, our stupendous advancement
is recalled, the fact should not be overlooked
that our progress has not been by chance, but
is the result of a wise observance of the mone
tary laws that control national health and
vigor, aud while we contemplate with pride
the commauding place we occupy among the
nations ot the earth, we should not forget that
this has been gained only through a jealous
preservation of financial soundness and a
careful maintenance of unsuspected public
credit.
The high and firm financial gTonnd which
we have thus far been able to hold should not
be abandoned in the pursuit of a policy never
attempted without National injury and whose
bright promise of individual beneiit has never
been fulfilled. If there is anything in present
condiiions that impeaches experience and in
dicates that we can safeiy change our present
high financial standard for the free, unlimited
and independent coinage of silver they should
be made plainly apparent before such a radi
cal departure finds a place in pariy creed.
The tremendous consequences of a mistake
in dealing with the financial question now
pressed upon us as Democrats should con
stantly make us thoae'ntful and solicitous. I
am confident, therefore, that the voice of
the Tammany Society, always potent in party
counsel, will not fall to be heard In warning
and p'otest on an occasion which especially
inspires patriotism and at a time when the
felicitations of our people appropriate to Inde
pendence day are mingled with apprehension.
Senator Hill wrote as follows:
Having been commissioned by the Democ
racy of the State to attend as one of their dele
gates the approaching National Convention at
Chicago, I find myself unable to accept your
courteÂ«UK invitation. However, & few sugges
tions pertinent to the present crisis may be
deemea appropriate.
It is the duty of the Democratic party at the
present hour to adhere more formally than
ever to ita well-established usagea and to vig
orously maintain its cardinal principles.
Any departure for purposes of expediency at
this time, from either its usages or its prin
ciples, is fraught with danger.
Its usages are found in the rules and proceed
ings of its National Conventions from time im
memorial, and patriotism a 6 well as good policy
requires that no perilous experiment should
now be attempted by their abrogation.
Senator Hill then briefly summarizes the
party's creed, and in conclusion adds that
a substantial departure from these senti
ments and policies wiil surely invite dis
aster in Nation and State, while faithful
adherence to them will pave the way to
deserved success.
BANQUET IN LONDON.
Embassador Bayard. Presides Over a
Distinguished Gathering.
LONDON, Eng., July 4.â The American
Society in London gave its usual Fourth
of July banquet in the hall of the Criterion
restaurant to-night. The hall was beauti
fully decorated with American and British
Hags.
Hon. Thomas F. Bayard, American Em
bassador, presided. Covers were laid for
220 guests. Among those present were
the Embassadors and Consuls of the vari
ous powers and many well-known Ameri
cans.
Sir Richard Webster, the Attorney-
General, proposed a toast to the President
of the United States.
In offering the toast be paid a high
tribute to American institutions, which he
declared were as near perfection as human
wisdom and forethought could make them.
This statement was greeted with cheers.
Continuing Sir Richard dwelt upon the
honor and dignity with which Mr. Cleve
laod has filled the" office of President.
Embassador Bayard proposed "The
Day We Celebrate." In speaking to his
toast he said the experience of 120 years
had shown that no government was so
strong and safe as that which was anchored
in the affections of the people.
The echo and impulse of the voluntary
principle of government under which the
Americans lived had been felt in Great
Britain. Now there were no other two
countries in which the national heart
formed so ereatly the strength of their
Governments. He rejoiced at the assem
bling of Americans 111 .London. He ielt
completely at horne â as much so as in the
United States. [Cheers. J
He alluded to the visit to England of the
Honorable Artillery Company of Boston
as a gratifying sign of the times, and as
likely to hush the spirit that would seek
to create contention.
Mr. Greer proposed "The Community of
the English Speaking Peoples."
Replying to this toast the Right Hon.
James Bryce, M. P.. advocated a tangible
expression of the existing community of
feeling. He said he sometimes thought
that the law of each nation might be so
iltered aB to recognize the civic rights of
Che citizens of the ot .er.
Americans ought not to be alienated in
Sreat Britain and vice versa. The best
tray to cement the ties between the two
:ountries would be to establish a tribunal
to settle international disputes.

Alliance.
IT VERGES ON MYSTERY.
What Shall Be Done to Patch
Up the Tottering Turkish
Empire ?
THE CRETAN REVOLT SPREADS.
Frightful Slaughter in Armenia.
Three Thousand Non-Combatants
Slain at Van.
[Copyright, 1896, by the New York Timer]
LONDON, Eng., July 4.â The perplexed
continental situation is at all events a trifle
clearer than it was a week ago. Ever since
the disaster of Adowah threw Crispi out of
power Italy's position in international
politics has been queer to the verge of
mjstery. It was known that the new Pre
mier, Ru !ini, disliked the triple alliance
and believed that friendship with France
was the true Italian policy. Knowing
these to be bis views, it was natural to sus
pect him of seeking to carry them out, and
the uncertainty as to what he mieht not
secretly be doing in this direction has been
a source oi chronic uneasiness here, as at
Berlin and Vienna, since last April. Now
this element of doubt is removed. Rudmi,
under what compulsion one knows not,
has committed himself to the triple alli
ance and a warm English understanding
in outspoken terms, and the Italian Cham
ber has approved his attitude by a large
majority.
It is especially useful to have this mat
ter cleared up because we are plainly
drifting into a difficult and dangerous
situation. There haÂ« grown to be a regu
lar alternation now of weeks when the
Embassadors at Constantinople think they
have patched up the rotten old fabric of
the Turkish Empire so that it will stand a
while longer, with weeks when new and
alarming fissures yawn and the whole
structure seems toppling for the final fall.
This is one of the bad weeks. Crete, so
far from being pacified by the Porte's be
lated concessions, is systematizing its re
volt into a revolution. The Christian
Deputies elected to the National Assem
bly, which the Sultan has summoned to.
meet at Canea, either say that it is unsafe
for them to attend or if they come to
Canea will hold aloof, intending to Issue a
proclamation stating that the Assembly is
a fraud and that their true allegiance is
due to the revolutionary committee.
The Cretans are now holding most of the
rougher parts of the island in force. They
have 2000 Turkish regulars shut up In the
fortress of Kardanos and expect to be able
to starve them out, while elsewhere in j
mountain encounters the Turks are con
tinually defeated by ambushed rebels.
The GreeK GovernmentG overnment still maintains
a semblance of neutrality, but the Athe
nian press is quite offhand now and|openly
preaches a Cretan propaganda. It is
notorious, too, that a swarm of small
Greek traders are in Cretan waters, pro
fessedly distributing relief, but really
landing guns, cannon and munitions of
war for the rebels.
Stories come to-day of a disturbance on
the Turko-Greek frontier. They may or
may not be true, but certainly they are
not surprising.
In Armenia, also, matters have sudden
ly taken a grave turn for the worse. It is
understood here to-night that something
exceptionally terrible has happened at
Vau or in its vicinity. The Armenian
committeemen here say that 5000 non
combatants have been slaughtered by I
Turks and Kurds. From experience one j
learns to discount such figures, but no
doubt a sufficiently shocking atory will ar
rive from Van in a day or two.
What ia perhaps of more immediate im
portance is the sudden revival of predic
tions from Constantinople of revolutionary
outbreaks in the Turkish capital itself.
Precisely how much of this sort of thing
Europe can stand, or where she will draw
the line, baffles prophecy. It is evident
enough, however, that the nearer the
doomed Ottoman Empire approaches to
destruction the closer the European pow
ers are drawn toward the necessity of de
ciding what and who shall take its place.
That this decision will inevitably be set
tled by the sword has been an axiom in
European politics for generations.
Whether it is really unavoidable no one
can Bay, but we are drifting all the while
nearer to the point where it will be made
clear, ana the British Parliament, under
these circumstances, is awakening to the
importance of debatine the foreign out
look. It discussed the Cretan situation at
length last night, and on Monday it will
have an oratorical field day over the ques
tion of the payment of the India troops
now in the Soudan. The resolution of the
ministry to insist that India shall be
charged with the regular pay of these men
meanwhile, and that England shall only
pay their transportation expenses, not only
evoked a unanimous and vigorous Indian
protest, but angered four-fifths of the Tory
rank and file in the House and fully that
proportion of the Tory press.
With its large majority the Government
can no doubt carry its point, but it will be
done at the serious cost of party disaffec
tion. Why the Cabinet should do this it
would puzzle the wisest brain to tell.
Lord George Hamilton is presumably re
sponsible for it, but he is the most unpop
ular of all the aristocratic Irish barnacles
whom the whole party would be delighted
to see discarded. He assuredly contrib
utes no strength to the Ministry.
Chamberlain is said to have finally de
cided in favor of a select committee of the
Commons as the machinery for investi
gating Rhodes and the chartered com
pany. This is what the Radicals have
been urging and what all the chartered
company influences are against. It re
mains to be seen if he has secured the
assent of the Caoinet for this committee,
and if so whether the Tory House will be
allowed to pass a measure enabling the
committee to sit through the recess, which
alone would make it of any use. Upon
this point will turn the credit and wood
faith of the Ministry in dealing with the
whole Transvaal business.
The final adoption by the Reichstag of a
civil code for the whole German Empire
marks an era in the history of jnrispru
dence surpassing in importance any other j
since the Code Napoleon was imposed on
western Europe. Tnree commissions of Ger- j
man jurists have been toiling over this
task for nearly thirty years. The legal
confusion which they had to bring into
order was of tiie most extraordinary char
acter. Roman law as imported into Ger
many before Luther was born ruled over
the largest area of all. Seven million
Rhinelanders lived under the French code
of 1804, Prussia's common law dated from
1749, and then came some thirty minor
provincial codes, all conflicting, especially
in matters of inheritance and marriage.
It was a tremendous labor to create a new
system which would cause the minimum
friction in practice, but everybody seems
to be satisfied that this lias been done.
The general tendency of the new code is
to lay stress upon the duties and responsi
bilities uf property to the community.
This is hailed as a triumph of the German
idea over the Roman, which treated the
rights of property as absolute and in
alienable. It finds expression in numer
ous provisions limiting the arbitrary
powers of landlords over tenants, etc.
The principal innovation is in making
civil marriace compulsory.
Outside nations which have been watch
ing the extravagant fuss made over Li
Hung Chang in Germany with aome mis
givings breathe easier to-day, and even
permi: themselves to smile a little. The
Germans somehow got the notion that Li
had authority to place big contracts, and
accordingly they took him all over the
country wnerever there was a factory en
gaged in making anything the Chinese
were likely to want.
Everywhere lavish luncheons and ban
quets were the order of the day. Work
men paraded, towns were decorated and
at Essen 1 aron Krupp went to the length
of hastily molding a bronze statue of the
Chinese visitor. It was set upon a pedestal
and solemnly unveiled in his presence as
if the desire for such a memorial had long
been a National passion. After each visit '
that Li made it was rumored that he had I
civen immense orders for ships, guns, or I
balloons, as the case might be.
At the farewell dinner given him in
Cologne, however, on the verge of his de
parture for France, Li had his interpreter
thank the Germans warmly for all their
remarkable courtesies and explain that he
now had a very clear idea of the capabili
ties cf German industries, and when he
got back to China he wouid not fail to re
port what he bad seen. Unhappily, he
was authorized to do no more. This cruel
blow hits the German Chauvinists bard,
and they are already talking of "Mongo
lian j.erfidy."
In France the reappearance of Rouvier
as a parliamentary power, after it was sup
posed that the Panama scandals had ut
terly destroyed him, is the political sensa
tion of the hour.
His speech against the proposed taxa
tion of rentes is not only regarded as the
most important fiscal utterance of the
session, but it is credited in advance with
having killed the project in the Chamber.
All sides assume that Meline will now
withdraw the measure. Strictly speaking,
he ought also to resign, since the defeat
of the main feature of the budget is quite
the gravest rebuff a Premier can sustain.
But Meline is not of the resigning sort,
and, moreover, a recess of Parliament is
at hand.
There are numerous indications that the
French seaboard cities â Marseilles, as well
as Boredaux, Havre, Dunkirk and great in
dustrial hivt-s like Lyons, Lille and Rouen
â are getting ready to pool their issues
and maKe a formidable attack on Meline's
protection policy, which is ruining tnem
all.
The most remarkable illustrated Bible in
existence is shortly to be published at
Amsterdam in Dutch, English, German
and French editions. The project has
been ripening for years, but large capital
had to be subscribed first and numerous
contracts made. Everything is at last
ready for a Btart,
The work will appear In twenty-five
parts, each with four large pictures.
Burne-Jones, Gerome, Morot and Tissot
will do Genesis; Tadema, Exodus and
Numbers, and Jean Paul Laurence, Judges !
and Ruth. To Sargent and Israels will be ;
intrusted the story of David. Benjamin j
Constant will supply three pictures in j
(Samuel and two in the life of Christ, while 'â 
I Munkacsy has a scene surrounding the i
crucifixion. Many otlier eminent French
and German painters have commissions,
but Walters Crane, who does the cover 1
and some pictures, is the only English- j
man mentioned. Menzel has not yet en- |
tered the combination, but it is hoped
that he will do so. Harold Frederic.
METURY TO PETERSBURG.
Entry of Czar and Empress Into the
Decorated City.
PETERSBURG. RmOA, July 4.-The
Emperor and Empress made their en
try into Petersburg to-day. The build
ings along Newski Prospect were gayly
decorated with flags, flowers, etc., but the
crowd in the streets was not large and
there was very little suggestion of a Holi
day. The Mayor presented a resolution
passed by the corporation- founding a
children's hospital and remitting the ar
rears ol 14,000 rate-payers in commemora
tion of the coronation of the Emperor at
Moscow. From the cathedral their Majes
ties proceeded without a guard to the fort
ress and thence to the railway station,
where they took a train for the imperial
residence at TsarÃkoe Selo. The Czar and
Czarina will return to Petersburg on
July 7. The report that the Czar is suffer
ing from jaundice is untrue.
CUB ANS SCATTERED.
Seven Thousand, Spanish Troops Are on
the Sick Lilt.
HAVANA, Ccba, July 4.â Colonel Dru
alla reports that with 620 men he left the
Conchita estate near Bolodron, province
of Matanzas, marched toward La Jagua
and found the rebel parties, commanded
by Laciet, Rogue and other leaders, oc
cupying a strong position behind stone
fences.
The troops dislodged the rebels after a
strong resistance and a bayonet charge
caused them to flee in all directions. The
insurgents left twenty-three dead on the
field. The Spanish loss was four killed
and fifty wounded.
Surgeon-General Losada officially states
that the number of sick troops in the
whole island is 6810, besides 696 who are
suffering with yellow fever.
SEVEN INDIANS STARVE.
Unable to Beach the Jludton Bay Hunt-
ing Ground*, They Succumb.
TORONTO, Oxt., July 4.â News has
reached here from River Moisie on the
north shore to the effect that a party of
huntors from Moisie found the remains of
seven Indians about 200 miles in the inte
rior. The remains were those of a family
consisting of father, mother and rive chil
dren. A few notes in tne tf a^kouapi lan
guage, undoubtedly wiitten by the squaw,
showed that the family had started from
Moisie last fall for the "Hudson Bay hunt
ing grounds. After having traveled about
200 miles the provisions ran short and,
there being no game, one after another
succumbed to starvation, the woman being
the last to die.

with a salute of forty-six guns. At 11
o'clock there were literary exercises on the
same common, and Hon. Thomas Fitch
delivered an oration. He apostrophized
the Declaration of Independence in glow
ine language.
"It is a knitted chain of logic,' he said,
"a persuasive and passionate appeal, and
to this day it stirs the blood like the blare
of trumpets. It proves the Government
of George the Third to have been the most
unconscionable of tyrannies. It states
the case of the colonists with the force
of a demonstration in mathematics
and with the poetic beauty of
a song of David. It is Mirabeau's idea of
eloquence â 'reason permeated and made
hot with passion.' It is at once the pro
tocol, the ultimatum and the epic of the
revolution. Its diction is as faultless as
its spirits is high. It is the most powerful
and most beautiful state document in all
history."
There were exercises at La Jolla and
Coronado this afternoon, both attended by
Hundreds of people, but the great attrac
tion was the regatta on the bay. Thirty
yachts and sloops contested, and the sight
was the prettiest of the kind ever wit
nessed in this part of the State.
Swimming contests and otbur sports oc
cupied the afternoon hours.
The culmination of the celebration was
the carnival on the bay to-night, when the
Queen. Miss Caroline Polhemus, with a
suite composed of the leading young
people of the city, reviewed the I
procession from a glittering bar^e.
At 8 o'clock an extra service of several
dozen electric cars was placed on the route
to the water front, but they were inade
quate to accommodate the crowds, and
hundreds were forced to walk. The
wharves soon overflowed with the people.
Every boat on the bay, from skiff to
steamor, was pressed into use, and each
carried its quota of passenger*, besides ad
ding to the general illumination.
The ferry slips at Coronado and on the
San Diego side were ablaze with long rows
of candles.
Lines of light in regular form, outlining |
the shapes of yachts, sloops and catboats
ranged in line ready for the procession,
tilled the space between the Santa Fe and
Bpreckels wharf. Launches rigged with
lights darted hither and thither preparing
for the procession.
The ferry steamer Coronado was deco
rated with lights. Near the San Diego
slip was anchored the huge ferry
steamer Silver Gate, loaded with people
and carrying the Foresters' Band, which
played inspiring airs. The most conspic
uous single object was the British ship
Carradale, her four masts hung with lan
terns and her yards glittering with red
fire.
A gaily lighted launch circled around in |
the center of the bay, landing a few dim
figures on a barge which bad not yet been
lighted. The tug Santa Fe, which was to
lead a portion of the boats, tooted once or
twice and started down to pick up its
tows.
The tugs and launches leading the vari- j
ous sections of the parade sought their
places. The Santa Fe sounded four whis
ties and the procession started.
Then there was a sadden blaze on the
waters of the bay.
The queen's barge was illumned by the
pressing of a button. It blazed out in red,
white and blue electric lights, which were
manufactured by a dynamo stationed on !
t.ie bargre. The throne was a huge affair, !
decorated in the National colors.
From its columns streamed pennants !
and flags of every nation.
The queen, a beautiful girl of 18, clad in
a robe of satin, was seated on the throne.
high above her attendants, with a guard
on either side.
Below stood the maids of honor in
quaint court gowns, and attendants in ap- ;
propriate garb. The spectacle, like a pic- I
ture from fairyland, drew a tremendous ;
cheer from the thousands of spectators.
As the procession started thousands of I
pieces of fireworks were sent up frcm the j
boats and from either shore. A barge sta- I
tioned near that of the queen incessantly
sent up rockets, candles, flower-mines and I
unique pyrotechnic devices.
Another barge farther down stream re"
plied in kind. The British lars on the
Carradale mounted aloft and stood at
each yardarm, sending out rockets and
roman candies.
The sailor lads, Britishers though they
were, sent up three hearty cheers for
Uncle Sarc, ivhicb were answered by the
people on shore.
The long lines of illuminated vessels
passed and repasaed before the youtnful
ruler. Thus, with light, music and lav li
ter, the carnival continued until all the
boats had passed before the reviewing
barge, saluted the Queen and returned.
CROWDS INVADE HANTSONFILLS.
Twelve Thousand Visitors Participate in
the Merru- Making.
WATSONVILLE, Cal., July 4.âGlori
ous weather ad led to the success of the
second day of Watsonville's celebration.
In the parade this morning Mi>s Louise
Reiter, aB Goddess of Liberty, and Miss
Annie Struve, representing California,
were enthroned on handsome floats, and
they were applauded from end to end of
the line of march.
It is estimated that 12,000 visitors were
in Watsonville to-day. 80 great was the
crush that the hotels and private families
could scarcely provide meals for all. The
sports in the afternoon were one-sided but
interesting. The hose contest between
teams from Hullister, Gilroy, San Juan,
Salinas and Watsonville was won by Gil
roy in 51 1-5 sec. The 100-yard, 220-yard
and 300-yard footraces wereteach won by
Carr of Watsonville.
Tne festivities concluded with a pyro
technic display and a dance this evening.
PL A CER VIL LE'S INNOVATION.
El Dorado County Homen Conduct the
Celebration.
PLACERVILLE, Cal., Jnly 4.â Perhaps
nowhere in the United States has the an
niversary of American independence been
so uniquely and successfully celebrated as
here. Placerville's progressive women took
the initial step, and carried out each
feature of the programme clearly. Mrs,
Georgia Ralaton whs president of the ex
ercises and introductory speaker; Mrs. J.
B. Rutter was the orator; Miss Tillie
Thomas recited the Declaration of Inde
pendence with histrionic ability, and Miss
Schlnier declaimed a patriotic poem writ
ten for ths occasion by Mrs. Reid. There
was baud music and singing by a great
chorus. The liteiary exercises opened
with a prayer by Cuaplain Mrs. Mac Do
nald. and closed with a bonediction.
The parade, too, was in charge of the
fair sex, and their ingenuity was made
manifest in floats of wondrous beauty.
The county sheriff had a unique outfit in
which he rode with bis sister; the miners
had a great float; the Native Daughters,
the Rebekahs, the Eastern Star Lodge, the
Rathbone Sisters and other woman's so
cieties were in line. The grand marshal,
Mrs. Fox, and her aids managed the pro
cession capitally.
The Goddess of Liberty of the parade
was Miss Davis. Ward Beech represented
Uucle Sam and Miss Pearl Varozza acted
as drum major. A feature much ap
plauded was t:.e living flag, formed of 250
children, who sang as they marched.
The officers of the woman's organiza
tion to whom credit is due for the success
of to-day's fete are: Miss Mollie Car
penter, president; Mrs. George H. Burn
ham, treasurer; Miss Ella Schlaier, secre
tary, and Mrs. Judge Bennett, chairman
of filteen sub-committees.
Not only in spectacular effect and liter
ary merit were their efforts crowned by
success, but they planned an excellent
programme of sports, which amused the
visiting throngs during the afternoon.
SACREMENTANS BURN POWDER.
Housing Observance of the Nation 1
Birthday Anniversary.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 4. â The
Fourth was observed in rousing style by
the patriotic citizens of this city. The day
was ushered in by a salute of thirteen
guns, repeated at noon and evening. The
parade was one of the largest ever seen
here, one of the best features being the
procession of wheelmen with magnifi
cently decorated bicycles.
During the literary exercises Charles E.
Reith, a pupil of the High School, recited,
verbatim, the Declaration of Independ
ence. The oration, by Hon. Frank H.
Gould, was a history in brief of the coun
try's progress from 1776 to the present
time, and the speaker delineated the need
of reforming the evils o! the present day.
At the close o f . the exercises those who
took part were carried away to partake of
the hospitalities of the Pioneers.
The Horribles captured the city in the
afternoon, and there was a display of fire
works at Agricultural ParK in the evening.
IN SONGMA'S GAT CAPITAL.
Santa Jtosans Celebrate From the First
Peep of Dawn,
SANTA ROSA, Cal., July 4. â The
Fourth of July was celebrated in Santa
Rosa in grand style. An enormous crowd
and a perfect day spurred the managers of
the celebration to renewed effort, and
many features not on the original pro
gramme were produced. Joseph Cleve
land Curry was in charge of the powder
burning, he having performed like services
for this city for the past twenty years, and
at 4 a. m. ten big anvils roared their salute
ten times each.
The parade that moved along the princi
pal streets during the forenoon was en
livened by the music of the Ukiah So
noma and Santa Rosa bands. Miss Louise'
Ross, as Goddess of Liberty, and Miss May
Hayward, as California, were enthroned
i in state upon i the principal float, sur
rounded by forty-seven little girls repre
senting i.he other and lesser States. Judge
Overtoil. Captain Byington. Mayor Niblett
and Judge Ku tied rode together in one
carriage.
These gentlemen have in the past years
held the chief offices in the gift of the
city, and their silken tiles were in the air
most of the time in response to the ova
tion by the assembled crowd.
: After 'the' parade, literary exercises of
unusua! merit were held in the Athenaeum
Mrs. J. B. Davis read the Declaration of
Independence with singular power ana
sweetr,eÃ3, adding, if possible, to the beau
ties oi the well-beloved document. The
oration by A. G. Burnett was a historical
and intellectual treat, quite different from
the usual spread-eagle Fourth of July
speech. A chorus of trained voices > |
by the sweet soprano of Miss Adelaide
Elliott, rendered National airs.
In the afternoon the Ancient and Dis
reputable Order of Squedunks burlesqued
the Darade, and made uproarious fun for
an hour or more. A feature of the day
was a burlesque newspaper, which Dora
title of "The Truthful Lyre." It w:'.3 a
pretentious little sheet, about the size of
the usual country newspaper, and was
fill d from headlines to finish wi h local
hits and good-natured criticism of leading
men and measures. An edition ol 25' jo
copies of this remarkable newspaper was
quicHy exhausted, and copies are now at
a premium.
The day's entertainment concluded with
a brilliant display of fireworKs.
VETERANS MARCH AT VENTURA.
Judge William* Delivers an Oration at
Camp Phil Sheridan.
VENTURA, Cal., July 4.â July 4, 1896,
will go down in the history of Ventura
County as a redletter day. Never before
have such crowds assembled here as those
that gathered to enjoy to-day's parade.
Superior Judge Williams, as president ol
the day, conducted the exercises, consist
ing of singing by a chorus of 200 voices
and an oration by Judge B. N. Smith of
Los Angele- in the Grand Army of the
Repuolic tent at Camp Phil Sheridan.
The parade was made up of three divi.
sions, one of which was composed exclu
sively of veterans and members of kindred
or.anizations, under command of Colonei
George Downing and staff. In the G. A. R,
division were Gen ral C. F. A. Last and
staff of the National Guard, the city au
thorities of Santa Barbara and Mayor
Hartwell of Pasadpna. In the main divi
sion were floats of the Rebekah lod^e,
Las Pal mas Parlor, Native Daughters of the

ana the Southern California Veterans'
Association.
THE DAY AT VALLETO.
Marines and L,and*men Mingle in Pa-
triotic Demonstrations.
VALLEJO, Cal., July 4.â A1l day long
and far into the nignt thousands of people
crowded Vallejo's streets, wharves, hill
sides and eating-houses. Large numbers
came from all parts of the country. At
noon the bat:ery at the Navy-yard thun
dered forth a National salute; flags flew at
every masthead on the ships, and scores of
yachts with flying pennants made the
river front a scene of beauty.
At sunrise the people were awakened by
the noise of guns and the ringing of belis.
Early in the morning the people began to
assemble. The Ariel Bicycle Club came
out with elaborately bedecked wheels, and
over them mammoth canopies and Hags.
The procession, which passed through the
principal streets, was composed of bicycle
brigades, United SStates marines and sail
ors from the naval station in lull uniform,
veterans of the Mexican and Civil wars,
Pioneers of California, city officials from
Bunicia and Vallejo, School Directors,
officers {if the day, and those who assisted
in the literary exercises. The Benicia fire
companies and those of Vallejo were out
in force.
Samoset Tribe of Red Men was repre
sented by a large tribe of braves in Indian
costume, astride of broncos, while fol
lowing them came a float representing a

LIBERAL PURSES GIVEN.
Exciting Finishes Mark the Con
tests on the New Four-
Lap Track.
STOCKTON SPORTING CARNIVAL
California Athletes Compete on River
and Track and in the Roped
Arena.
PETALUMA, Cai . July 4.â A large
crowd, fast and exciting racing, and an at
tendance of wheelmen from all over the
State, characterized the eleventh annual
meet of the North California Division of
the LeMrue of American Wheelmen, held
here to-day under theanspiceso! the Peta
luma Wheelmen. The new four-lap
track was expected to secure some records
for the rider?, but in this it was a disap
pointment, or perhaps it was because the
men did not rule fast enough. Still the
heats and finals of the different events
were all contested, and the times averaged
quite fast. â¢ *>;Ur ,yi
All the prominent wheelmen of San
Francisco and other parts of the State are
here, most of them having arrived last
night. They will stay to-morrow for the
picnic run and return on Monday.
At the league hotel some of the cycling
notables registered are: F. H. Kerrigan,
F. 11. Dunne, R. M. Welch, Joseph F. '

others. Wheelmen are everywhere and
tbe hotels are crowded with them.
This morning a competitive parade of
the clubs resulted in the California Cycling
Club getting first prize and the Reliance
Club Wheelmen second.
Although the race? in the afternoon
drew large crowds, the Petaluma Wheel
men have expended so much money in
"he preparations ana have been so lavish
in the entertainment of their guests thtt
they will profit littie oy the meet. The
prizes offered for the races are very liberal,
and all the details of the meet showed
care, attention and expense.
Ladies constituted the larger part of the
audience at the rfrack this afternoon, and
they all had their favorite?, for whom tbey
cheered enthusiastically. Allan Jones,
Bob Long. Johnny Kdwaro". Percy Mott,
Charley Bates and Hob Terrill were the
particular favorites of tbe grand stands,
and no doubt the encouragement they
thus received tended to make them exert
themselves more than ever.
The riders of the Olympic Club won more
than a majority ol the races, and the Oat
land boys from the Reliance and Acme
clubs made a good showing. The "lucky"
Bay City-* were out of luck to-day, save for
a tow places in heats they got nothing.
The iirst race of the day was the one
mile L. A. W. championship, in four heats
ana a tinai. Noonan. Santa Rosa, ana
Fantaiv Olympic, fell in the iirst heat, and
Kosenteini. Reliance, in the *econa, but
esv-apeu unhurt. l'ho*e who Qualified for
the final were: Mott. Reliance: Wing and
Chapman, Olympic; Westphal, Kenna and
NisscV.. Acme.
Mott jet tbe pace tbe first lap, NiÂ«sen
the second and Kenna the third, "and then
the bell rang lor the last lap and they
sprinted for home. It was a great ride be
tween all six, and Kenna, Wing ana Molt
crossed tne tape almost on a line. The
judges decided it in that order, but half
the grand star.d thought Mott was second
and voiced their . opinion noisily. The
time was 2:59 1-5, rather slow for a cham
pionship race.
After the race Referee Plnmmer dis
qualified Wine for a foul on the last lap,
which decision gave Mott second and
Riaaea third. Wine rode wide on the last
turn and crowded Mott out. j
The mile handicap (professional) run in,
two beats and a final was' a gift from the
handicapper to the long-mark men. as the
scratch men and those on back marksâ
lones, Terriil, Edwards ana â had to
work so hard to catch the leaders that they
were too tired to sprint at the finish*.
Those who qualified for the final were
Dow, Whitman. Davis, Byrne, Deventha),
Cushing and Boyden. Davis won from
Boyden, though with - but little to spare,
and Whitman took tbird money,
There'wcre two accidents in the mile
handicap, amateur. In the second heat
G. M. Hamlin ran oil the bank after the
race, in which he finished second, just as
he was slowing.up. He was considerably
braised about the face and arms. Metcalf
and McKay collided in I the seventh heat,
but escaped unhurt. Those who qualified
in their heats for the final were Wing,
Noonan, Rosenheim, C. M. Smith, Chap
man, Stewart, E. J. Smith and B. C. Ray
naud. The men bad various handicap;
and were ail strung out at the start, but
they were all bunched on . the third lap,
and tbe eight men made a pretty race of it.
C. M. Smith barely bÂ«at Chapman for first
place, and E. J. Smith was a good third,
the others all close up.
The one-half mile professional scratch
was divided into three heats and a final,
and brought out all the cracks in this
class on the coast. In (he first heat Down
ing. Edwards, Byrne, Lone and Gunn
started. It was a "Joel" for the first lap,
but they livened up the pace on the sec
ond. Edwards looked ail the way a win
ner coming into the stretch, but Long
came fast on the outside and beat him,
and Downing wheeled into second place.
Time, 1:22 2-5.
In the second heat were Jones, Barnes,
Boyden, Osen and dishing. It was a pretty
finish between Jones, Osen and Boyden,
who crossed the line in that order in
1:141-5. -
Dow, Haley. "Bob" Terrill, Davis and
Whitman rode the third heat. The latter
fell on the second lap, his rear tire col
lapsing. Terrill won as he pleased in 1:15,
Dow second.
This brought into the final r Jones, Ter
rill. Long, Osen,- Dow and Downing, who
lined tip for the start in that order from
the pole. A special prize of $15 was of
fered by the management for the rider
ahead at the end of the final lap, which in
duced the men to sprint for the lead | from
the start. Downing got the coveted place;

STOCKTON CANNIVAL OF SPORT
/fore* oh Land and Water, Fotloired by
Horing Tournament.
STOCKTON, Cal., July 4. â To-day's
carnival of sports was a great success. The
regatta on the channel was witnessed by
thousands. . The first event was the junior
outrigger-skiff event, in which George W.
Phelan of the Ariel Rowing Club and A.
Webb and E. B. Had cock of the Ala
meda Boating Club entered. Phelan was
the first to get the water and led the way
down the course. He turned the stake
boat two lengths ahead of Hadcock and
came away an easy winner. He romped
home in easy time and won by two
lengths in 13 1-5 minutes, with Hadcock
second.
The second event was the junior barge
race, in which the South End Rowing
Club entered: Ed Tobin, bow; MattÃreen,
forward-waist; â James, after-waist; J.
E. Scully, stroke; George McGuire, cock
swain. The Stockton Athletic Associa
tion entered: W. Folger, bow; Fred Ar
nold, forward-waist; J? SUva, after- waist;
J. Burns, stroke; W. Dolan, cockswain.
The Stockton men were the first to
catch the water and led for a time, but the
South Ends were rowing a SS-stroke to the
Stocktons' 40, and the steady pace of the
men from the City counted in the long
run. The Stockton men turned the stake
boat first, but on the run home tne South
Ends caught and passed them and won by
threelength3 in 10 mm. 27 sec
The next race was for the senior out
rigger skiff? in which there were three
entriesâ F. W. Ayres and S. J. Pembroke
of the Alameda Boating Club and James
Wilson of the Ariel Rowing Clab. Ayres
pulled . well and surprised the knowing
ones. Wilson beat him to the stake, but
on the home journey Ayres forged ahead
and won by eight lengths in 11:49. Wilson
liniÂ«hed second, with Pembroke out of tne
race.
The single scull event was a surprise to
everybody. Alt expected to see McCans
land win. The entries were W. J. Me-
Caualand of the Ariel Rowing Club,
Frank Dupiissea of the South End Rowing
Club and Louis Giovanessi of tbe Stockton
Athletic Association. Giovanessi got the
best of the start, but after that he was
never in the race, a* Daplis?ea palled the
race of his life and led from the start to
the finish. He won by two lengths in
11:232-5. from McCauiland.
The last race in the regatta was the in
termediate barge race, in which the South
Knd Rowing Club entered the same crew
that went in the junior race; the Stockton
Atnietic Association the Giant crew, with
Tom Carkeek, bow; Charles Spencer, for
ward; G. E. Chapman, after- waist; Carl
Davis, stroke; Will Dolan, cockswain.
Owine to a long delay on tbe part of the
Souti hnds and to the statement made by
Pembroke of the Alanieda Rowing Club
that the South Ends were not going to
row, only two crews started. The other
crew was that of the A.ameda Rowing
Club, composed of Ai Bullion, bow; \\ .
Hansen. forward-wai-t; At Webb, after
waist; F. W. Ayres, stroke. Toe Stockton
men won as they pleased.
The field-day games were even more suc
cessful than tbe resatta. In tbe bicycle
race there were rive entrie?. Tbe race was
for the championship of San Joaquin
County, and was won by J. K. Crump in
2:27 2-5, with T. R. McCuen second.
WÂ« Â£. Dawson of the Amateur Academic
League won the pole vault, with Donald
Wood rum of the same team second.
In the one mile handicap there were
tweire entries, and J. E. Crump of the
Stockton Road Club, the scratch man,
won in 2:33, with T. R. McCuen of the
same club second.
The 100-yard dash was won by Tom Car
keek of the Stockton Athletic Association
in :10 2-5, with E. C. Mau of the Amateur
Academic League second.

Tne boxing tournament drew some 3000
people to the pavilion. The ring was
pitched in the middle of the big hall, and
when Boxing Instructor Armstrong of the
Stockton Athletic Association announced
the first event every seat about the ring
was taken.
The first bout was a four-round contest
between Charles Rochette and Frank Ra
pnael. The contest was spirited, but
neither secured a decision.
The audience wanted to see some gore
and it waited patiently. It was soon to
see it. Ben Maxwe.l and Jack Hopkins
donned the mittens. Maxwell is a local
colored man, who has a good future before
him. At the end of the first round Hop
kins threw up the sponge and quit. Max
well was given the decision
George Green and Armstrong next
sparreu four clever rounds and drew much
applause for their quick work.
The contest of the evening followed. It
was between Theodore Van Buskirk and
PatÂ«y Corrigan for six rounds. Van Bus
kirk went at his man from the start and
soon had him blejeding from mouth and
nose. He knocked the Australian down
three times in the first round, but Corrigan
seemed a glutton for punishment and again
faced the music. Van Buskirk went at
him in the second. Three times he knocked
him down aud finally got in a right on the
jaw that put Corrigan to sleep.
The police then interfered *nd prevented
the ten-round contest between Charlie
Turner and Tom Barry. Cries for Barry
and Turner were heard on all sides, but
the officers would not permit them to go
on, as it was known that it would be another
Knockout affair. R a f e Turner and Ben
Maiwell sparred tnree rounds in their
?tead and then Charlie Turner sparred
four rounds with a heavy-wei*ht colored
man by the came of George Washington.
Turner had the best of it, but Washington
showed up very well.

COMPANIONS IN
LIFE AND DEATH
Joseph Taber's Wife Sur
vives Him Hardly Two
Days.
BOTH WERE PIONEERS.
Five Generations of Their Fam
ily Were Living at the
Same Time.
OLD AGE CAUSED BOTH DEATHS
A Small Estate Left, Which Will Be
Inherited by Their Two
Daughters-
For eighty-two years Joseph Taber had
wandered along life's pathway. The
memories of his youthful days had be
come chilled and dampened by the snows
of many winters, and his eyesight dimmed
by the dust, tbe glare and v the heat of
numerous summers, but his mind was
vigorous and his heart beat lightly for all
that. There was one to soothe him in his
old age, who had borne him company
through all his joys and sorrows, his red
letter days and his periods of trial and
vicissitude, his wife Caroline Taber.
Joseph bad passed the eighty-second
milestone of life, and from the eminence
to which he had climbed could gaze back
over a long and industrious career, but the
vision of his wife Caroline extended
further than that. Her toil through the
desert of life witti the rest afforded by its
oases had gone on and on for eighty-three
years. Her silvered hairs bore honorable
evidence of the crosses she had borne.
Upon the side of a hill at 1607 Mason
street lived this q".aint old couple. They
had been living there as long as the oldest
neighbors could recollect.
As regularly as clockwork their curtain
would be raised at early mom, and shortly
after the shades of twilight had fallen
their light would be extinguished. They
were regular in their habits, this old
couple. The wisdom of this course, the
old man said, their long experience had
taught them.
But a week ago there came a change. No
longer did the curtain rise in the morn
ing, and all was silent and hushed.
Kind neighbors grew apprehensive and
investigated the changed condition of
affairs. When J. T. Tate, who lives on tbe
opposite side of the street, knocked at
their door it was some time ere he ob
tained a response, and then the old man
came to the door and slowly opened it.
His strength was exhausted with the
effort and he sank to the floor.
It was a sad tale this cray-haired patri
arch bad to tell. His wife had been ail
ing in health for four or five years, and he
had done all the housework during that
time. But a few days before Tate visited
him he also had succumbed to the ravages
of time and had been forced to recline his
stiffened limbs upon a couch.
T bey did all they could for the aged
couple, these kind neighbors; medical
skill was summoned and a competent
nurse provided, but it was all in vain. The
angel of death had Knocked at their door
and marked them for his victims.
Wednesday morning at 2 o'clock tbe old
man quietly passed across the dark river,
where he firmly believed would come sur
cease of trouble and care.
His funeral procession had hardly filed
away from the undertaker's at 2 p. m. Fri
day when tbe news came that his wife also
had ceased to breathe. As she had accom
panied him in life, in death she had joined
him.
The old man was a genius, the neighbors
say, and not only furnished his house gen
erally and in detail, but made his own
clothes as well. As for the old lady, little
was seen of her. One year ago last Octo
ber she descended the steep flight of stairs
that leads to the little dwelling on the
hill, and presented a beautiful bouquet of
roses and other fragrant flowers to her
neighbor, Mrs. Tate. Prior to that time,
it is said, she had not descended those
steps for four long years.
Besides some $3000 in the bank, the old
man is said to have left real estate, with
improvements, valued at about $4000. This
will doubtless be inherited by the only
surviving relatives, his daughter and her
daughter, for both had been married be
forj their union.
The old man's daughter is the wife of
Dr. Wilder of Lob Angeles; and that of
his wife, Mrs. Caroline Guilda of Boston.
Both are said to be old women and to have
grandchildren themselves, one being said
to have even a great-grandchiid. Their
arrival here is expected at any time.
Mrs. Taber's remains are in the hands
of embalmers, and will be interred by the
side of her husband this afternoon. This
is said to be the last wish expressed by her
in life.
OPENING OF THE CASINO,
A Good Variety Bill Presented
at the New Chutes
Theater.
The Black Falti Made a Distinct
Hit â Imperial Russian
Orcbestra.
There was a large crowd at the opening
of the Chutes Casino, on Haight street,
| yesterday afternoon. The building is a
1 Â£ood deal in the style of the late Vienna
I Prater of Midwintet Fair fame, bu> it is
I without the cumbersome galleries whic'i
i disfigured the Prater. There are tables
| where liquid and solid refreshments can be
! partaken of, and it goes without saying
that smoking is not prohibited.
Tiie acoustic properties of the building
are by no means unsatisfactory, though in
big barnlike structures of the kind, with
high-raftered rools, it is not to be expected
that the sound will carry quite so well as
in a regularly built theater.
The loity roof, however, wiil be of great
service in giving full scope for the per
formances of acrobats and aerialists.
The Mario-Dunham family, who formed
part of yesterday's programme, appeared
to much better advantage than they had
previously done at the Orpheum on
account of the wide space for their aerial
somersaults.
The Imperial Russian Court orchestra.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1896.
under the direction of Jules Simonoff,
made its first San Francisco appearance
and piaved popular operatic selections
brightly and crisply and with a good
rhythmic swing. The orchestra is dis
tinctly of a popuiar kind. It would be
improved by a few more strings, but the
brass is gooa and does not become noisy
and a good deal of shading was obtained.
The Black Patti made a decided hit,
receiving two encores and enough applause
to justify her in taking a third. She had a
powerful soprano voice of wide range,
which is particularly ringing in the upper
registers, and her command nver her
breath is something remarkable. Barring
too much tendency to indulge in a
tremolo, she singa with scholarly
finish, and is as much at home in florid,
bravura operatic arias as in simple folk
songs. Her first sontr yesterday was an
ana from "I Lombardi, which she sang
with the ease of an experienced prima
donna. "The Cowa Are in the Clover,"
was lr r first encore, and "Old Folks at
Home," which she sang with charming
pathos and simplicity, was her second
encore.
Professor Fred M&cart's trained African
baboon and monkey and dog comedians at
once endeared themselves to the audience
by their intelligence and agility. The
baboon was property man and showed
great industry and common sense in ar
ranging ail the accessories needed for the
performance. As for the canines, many of
them proved to be positive artists. One
little gray dog wore a wig and did a whirl
wind dance in rainbow-tinted skirts; an
other executed a skirt dance and managed
his flowing draperies like a miniature Loie
Fuller. The hero dog of the company was
a fireman, who rescued an infant from a
house which should have been ablaze, but
which the property man had forgotten to
ignite.
The dog did his part of the performance
just the same by dying of his iniuries on
the stage. His fellow-firemen gave him
a grand funeral, while his widow wept
tears over his remains.
Two other canine artists put on gloves
and showed a great deal ot science in a
three-round prize fight. They were
finally arrested for violating the law by a
dog dressed as a policeman.
The performance of Virginia Aragon, a
wire-walker, came to an abrupt end
through her apparatus breaking down.
There was a good deal of delay between
several of the acts, owing to the stage
machinery not having been completely
finished.
Crowds of people visited the other at
tractions at the Chutes, which have been
added to by a haunted swing. In the
evening there wer? some fine fireworks on
the lake. A pyrotechnic portrait of Wash
ington forty feet square was also ex
hibited.
FROM THE SEAL ISLAND
The Government Agent on St
George Returns After
Two Years.
Accompanied by Others Who Have
Seen Longer Service in B'.eak
Bering Sea.
J. E. Ziebacb, who has been on St.
George Island in Bering Sea for the last
two years, is at the Occidental. He ar
rived from Unalaska yesterday on the
steamer Homer, which made the trip
down in nine days.
Mr. Ziebach held the official Govern
ment position as agent on St. George
Island, and is now on his way to visit bis
wife in Scotland, S. D., where he was for
merly engaged in journalism.
"The Government appoints four agents
for the sealing grounds in the Bering
Sea," said he. "Each of the large seal
rookeries thus has a Government guar
dian. St. George Island is one of the
Prybiloff group, which consists of St.
Paul, an island about twelve miles long
by four miles wide; St. George, about ten
miles by three miles, and two small rocky
islets where there are walrus, but no seals.
"There is a settlement called St. George
on St. George Island of about 100 natives.
It is pretty desolate in winter, although
the weather is not so severe on the main
land.
"The Government used to permit 100 000
seals to be taken annually from 1880 to
1890, but there was such an alarming de
crease in the number of seals that the
limit was reduced to 15,000. This year,
however, the limit has been increased to
30,000. Well, 1 have my doubts that the
companies will be able to kill that many
young males on the islands. This regula
tion affects only the rookeries and the sea
for a distance of sixty miles around them.
Outside of that, in tbe open water, as many
seals as can be captured without firearms
may be taken. Between forty and fifty
sealing vessels take advantage of the open
water hunting each season, the averaee
catch for each vessel being about 800 seals,
and fully eigbt-tentbs of them are cows.
"J. B. Crowley of Robinson, 111., has re
lieved me as agent at St. George. The
other agent is James Judge from Colum
bus, Ohio. I shall go back as soon as I
receive orders.
"On the Homer as a fellow-passenger to
this City was Dr. Gardner Percy Pond,
who has returned here to his old home
after service on St. Paul Island, wiiere he
was company physician. The Govern
ment requires of the company that holds
the sealing privijeee that it must have a
physician on each island to care for and
dispense drugs to the natives without
charge. He is going back on the Homer
as soon as it reloads for Unalaska.
"Mr. and Mrs. J. Tuck also came down
from Unalaska. They came away for
good alter seven years' most successful
work at the head of the Government Home
Mission School. Theirs was the best work
of the kind that has been done in that
part of Unalaska. A Miss Sowl and a
Miss Meller are now in charge of the
school.
"The Government built a new home
there last summer, and the Methodist
Home Missionary Society had a building
put up, but both were blown down, as
they had been poorly constructed. The
contractor has to rebuild them this sum
mer.
"We eet the papers on St. George ouly
once in eiu'ht months, so I am a little be
hind on news generally, and particularly
about this Government expedition just
sent into Bering Sea.
"We are the first that have come out of
Bering Sea this year.

A GENEROUS DONATION.
The Emporium Gives SIOOO to Secure
the Endeavor Convention for
San Francisco.
Another material lift has been given to
the cause of the Christian Endeavorers in
securing the great Christian Endeavor
convention in 1897 for this City.
This was no less than the donation yes
terday by the Emporium, the big depart
ment store on Market street, of
toward the convention fund. This is one
of *tl:e m<sst generous offers yet made.
N>'t content with the monetary offer the
big store has also offered its large assem
bly rooms. 275 feet long, as headquarters.
The rooms are offered free, with free pa
pers, stationery, etc. The offer, owing to
the unsurpassed central location of the
Emporium, will be seriously considered by
the association, should the convention be
secured.
It would seem, too, that there can be
little doubt that the â¦'25.000 required to
guarantee an entertainment fund will be
more than subscribed, and the present
magnificent donation by the Emporium
would indicate that broad-minded, far-see
ing citizens are eager to be m the van
guard which will receive the honor of hav
ing gained tbe big convention for San
Francisco.

LOYALTY ON THE FRONT,
A Yacht Lying at Jackson-Street
Wharf Looted by Water
Thieves.
How a Perambulating Machinist and
His Family Take Their Country
Vacations.
Along the water front out on the bay
the shipping was profusely and prettily
decorated â colors flying from mast and
yard. All of the British vessels in the
harbor flew their bunting with Old Glory
at the fore and their own national ensign
at the mizzen, a graceful observation of
the American natal day.
The white cruiser Charleston showed all
her flags and signal numbers streaming
from head to stern and the old monitor
Comanche fairly outdid herself. Over her
decks and above the bridges white awn
ings were spread and lines of bunting
blazed fore and aft.
Two divisions of the Naval Reserve are
quartered aboard of the vessel with their
bedding, rations and accouterments, and
once more she is a man-of-war. It is tbe
intention of Lieutenant Commander Tur
ner to give the battalion several days' drill
afloat at the guns and in the boats. Offi
cers and men alike are standing watch
and performing all their duties under the
strict discipline of the navy.
The water - front thieves were quite
active around Jackson-street wharf Friday
night. James Paine, the owner of the
yacht Wave, left his vessel alongside of
the dock about 5 o'clock in the evening
and returned at 11.
A considerable change had taken place
in his absence. The little vessel had been
overrun and she showed unmistakable
siens of being the worse for wear. Not
only had she been rummaged around the
deck but tbe cabin had been plucked
clean.
From clothing to eatables the visitors
had helped themselves, sparing nothing.
They took a large iron-bound trunk which
indicates that they boarded the yacht in a
boat. The other plunder was a 12-gauge
I shotgun, one large marine glass, three
I suits of clothes, several bairs of powder and
shot, an extension bit, a saw-set and all
the provisions the cabin contained.
The thieves also took a number of valu
able papers belonging to the owner,
among which were the deeds to several
pieces of property in South San Francisco.
These could be of no use to anybody ex
cept to Mr. Paine, and to take them away
was mere wantonness and a reasonless
theft. The police aTe making a search for
the missing articles, but have not yet
founa any trace of them.
Among the great crowd that took the
ferryboats for a trip into the country yes
teniay were Alfred Ehrenclou of 1108
Hyde street and his family, a wife and
five small children.

The perambulating machinist made a
small sensation when be came down on
the ferry wharf with his party. He was
trundling a baby-carriage, in which were
seated, facing each other, twinsâ a boy
and girlâ about 16 months old. Behind
the small vehicle was a canvas seat, where
the next youngster, a boy about four
years old, could ride when he got tired of
walking. Two other small boys and the
hardy little mother made up the party.
On the running-gear under the body of
the carriage, neatly folded up. was a can
vas tent, bedding, provisions and a few
cooking utensils. The whole load, babies
and all, weighed about 160 pounds. A
movable awning covered the tiny passen
gers from the sun.
"This is the way we take our outings,"
said the machinist, "and we enjoy them.

and as we are all great walkers it suits our
purpose. If the way is too rough or we
get too tired, we take the train, and when
we get enough of that we get off and strike

are at home till we wish to move again.

While the father was talking one of the
babies began to nod in its carriage and
the mother hung a curtain from the awn
ing, which folded in the drowsy occupant,
and it slept peacefully there.

F. G. Smith Takes Hit Life While

F. G. Smith, who in life was a carpenter
and resided at 1217}^ Golden Gate avenue,
committed suicide, it is presumed, judg

nve days ago. The body was discovered
lnst evening by J. Holland, who lives at
1108 Golden Gate avenue.
He was passing the house occupied by
Smith and noticed a strong odor of gas
which appeared to flow through the tran
som. He notified a policeman and they
forced an entrance and found the body,
which was in an advanced stage of de
composition, lying on a bed in one of the
rear rooms. The Coroner was notified
and the body was removed to the Morgue.
It is presumed that despondency caused
by family troubles prompted Smith to
take his life^
AT THE LAND NG PLACE.
The Big Tree at the Battery Where
Newcomer* Find Shelter.
At tbe southeast corner of Battery Park,
opposite the landing place of the ferry
from Ellis Island, there is a big tree over
whose roots, and held in place by a stone
curbing running around it, is a flattened
mound of earth. This mound often serves
as a seat for immigrants just come from
Ellis Island, and waiting here to rest, or
until friends shall come for them, or until
their guides shall murshal them to take
them on to their destination.
Men, women and children from many
lands have sat on this mound under the
big tree and tal'red in many tongues, or
have here silently formed their first un
prossions of the New World. There has
been among them no future President of
the United States, for he must be a native
of the couutry, but there may have been
future Senators and Representatives in
Congress, and legislators in the various
States to which they have gone, and boys
who have become Judges or conspicuous
in other waits of public life; and there
have been many girls who have become
happy wives and mothers in the new land,
and older folks who have lived here happy
and contented lives, and over them all
aiike the big tree has waved its friendly
branches. â New York Sun.

SAD ENDING OF
A PLEASURE TRIP.
F. A. Coulter Drowned
Yesterday in San
Pablo Bay.
YACHTING TO BENICIA.
He Is Supposed to Have Slipped
and Fallen Into the
Water.
THE FATHER GRIEFSTRICKEN.
Now Only One Son of His Family of
Eight Children Is Lsft to
Comfort Him.
A sad accident befel a yachting party
that left Tiburon Friday evening for Beni
cia, whereby one of the party, F. A. Coul
ter, was drowned in the waters of San
Pablo Bay. The party consisted of four
young men of this City, James P. Devine,
Ed A. Linforth and F. A. Coulter, all resi
dents of the Mission, and Frank Koster,
who lives on Third street, near Howard.
While sailing along with a stiff breeze
about 2 o'clock yesterday morning Coulter
slipped and fell overboard, and although
his companions endeavored to find him,
they could see nothing of the missing man.
"We left Tiburon between 8 and 9 o'clock
Friday night," said Ed Linforth, one of
the party|yesterday, "in the Ethel S. a trim
yacht of thirty-six feet length, and one of
the most seaworthy craft on the bay. We
intended to go to Benicia to spend the
4th and return Sunday.
"Between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morn
ing, ]ust after we bad passed Point Pinole,
we were scudding along with a good breeze.
1 was at the wheel, but I had my bacK
toward the bow, taking in the mainsail.
Coulter, or ' Jack,' as we familiarly called
him, came out of tbe cabin while I was
busy with the sail and stood on the cock
pit. Just as Jim Devine came out of the
cabin he saw Coulter slip and fall over
board from the cockpit and disappear.
"As soon as Devine saw Coulter fall he
shouted to me, 'Stop the boatâ Jack is
overboard.' I immediately brought the
boat to the wind and told Koster to cut
away the yawl.
"\Vith the small boat we hunted around
for nearly an hour, but couldn't see any
thing of Coulter. After this we started
back immediately and arrived at Tiburon
about 6 o'clock in the morning and noti
fied the Coroners of Marin and ban FraD
cisco counties."
F. A. Coulter, the young man who was
drowned, was about 25 years of age and
lived at 812 Church street, near Twentieth.
He was a painter by trade, although for
merly an iron-molder, and was a member
of the local Painters' and Decorators'
Union No. 1. He lived with his father,
William Coulter, and his older brother,
George M. Coulter, and had often gone
out in the Ethel S, which is owned by
young Linforth, a fellow-worker and close
friend of the drowned man.
The aged father was almost overcome
with grief when seen by a Call reporter
yesterday afternoon, a few minutes after
hearing of his son's sudden death.
"I wish I were dead," be repeated, as
great tears trickled down his grizzled,
cheeks; "now they are all gone but one.
Ten years ago my wife died and of a fam
ily of eight children George is the only one
left. I always mistrusted that yacht and
didn't want my son to go out in it. Oh, I
wish I were dead, I wish 1 were dead."

level of the sea. Glasgow is 30 feet above
it, Manchester 50 and Birmingham 300.

j resented the union of States. The drivers
i wore the costume of Uncle Bam. Ehr
man & Hauser's band was heard next.
The battle-ship Oregon and employes of
the Union Iron Works covered a good deal
of ground and were as prominent a feature
of the parade as there was in it. Every
body was interested in the miniature Ore
gon belching real fire and emoke and the
sound of battle from its real steel guns.
SmoKe poured from the smokestack. The
battle-ship was carried on an immense
float drawn by six proud, decorated horses,
with riders as well as a driver. It was
decorated with flags after the manner of a
real battle-ship. The many guns fired
blank cartridges all along the parade from
Front street to the counter march on Van
Ness avenue. There was a dog on the
hurricane deck labeled "Mascot." On the
two sides of the battle-ship were these in
scriptions in black letters: "Our Latest
â¢Baby,' " "16.79 Knots," "Protection,"
"Labor."
Be hind the model of the Oregon marched
about 1200 workmen of the Union Iron
Works. Some carried banners, others
clamps, and the rivet boys were there
holding rivets in tongs. The electrical
workers brought up the rear, riding in a
covered wagon decorated with flags. ~
The Seventh Division.
The seventh division was conspicuous
for several features. It was composed en
tirely of the Junior Order of United Ameri
can Mechanics and " The Little Red
Schoolhouse." It formed on First street,
and stepped into Market street after the
sixth division. Mark Lane was marshal,
chief aid, L. M. McCord, and other aids
were Mr. Quiry, Z. T. Whitten and Charles
Klein.
Kitzau's band marched after the mar
shals.
Then in brilliant platoons came the
Junior Order of United American Me
chanics in the following order: Lincoln
Council No. 1, General George Custer
Council No. 2. Starr King Council No 6
U. 8. Grant Council No. 19, J. A. Garfield
Council, Alexander Hamilton Council No.
Most ol the councils carried pampas
grass plumes of red, white and blue the
three colors in a cluster. They made a
pretty si<ht as they fluttered in the breeze.
They numbered about 700. A Continental
drum corps which divided the councils
was a unique feature.
The float the "District School," painted
red, brought up the rear. It was the
typical little red school, with doors and
window and brick chimney in the center
of the roof. A whitewashed picket fence
surrounded it, and inside the fence in
front of the schoolhouse was a group of
children, several ladies and a man con
spicuous in Continental costume- At each
anple of the fence was a corner-post of
fluttering flags. The children waved Gags.
The float was drawn by four white horses.
There were about a dozen guards, some on
horseback, around the little red school
house. It was occasionally cheered along
the line of march.
The Eighth Division.
Division Eighth, while probably the
smallest in the procession, proved to be
one of the most interesting. The officers
were A. A. Sarment, marshal; B. Raddie,
chief aid; C. Monte, M. Tovaruz and M*.
Mortizia, aids.
First came the officers in command and
hew to-pat;

playing American airs as though to the
manner born. Close behind followed
Council Florida No. 7, and Council
Amorda de Patria No. 5.
Then one of the prettiest features of the
whole parade swung into line. It was an j
immense tloat representing the Portuguese
explorer, Vasco da Gama, on board the
good ship San Gabriel en route for India.
She was manned by some ten swarthy j
sons, their headgear and costumes pre
senting a figure at once striking and pic
turesque. The float was driven by four
white horses gayly bedecked with yellow
trimmings.
The Japanese banrf, Asahi they call it.
headed the Japanese society, eighty
strone, under the command of S. Yamato.
The Japanese, attired in neat-fitting suits |
of white and carrying great bunches of
cherry blossom?, looked decidedly natty.
In fact, no part of the procession attracted
more general attention than did they.
In rear of the regular company came a
line of Japanese in uniform pulling an an
;ient howitzer, which they fired occasion
ally with muci effect. On Van Ness ave
nue this little gun was guilty of all man
ner of queer antics, causing the native
small boy to open his eyes in wonder and
amazement. For instance, during a halt
the gun was trained skyward, and then
fired. A deafening crash followed, and
then away up in the air, a thousand feet
or more, untur'ed an American flag. The
breezes caught the folds and kept them
open, and while admiring thousands
cheered contrary winds caught the na
tion's emblem and gently wafted it toward
the Oakland shore.
Later on the gun was again turned loose,
and this time far up in the blue dome ap- â¢
peared a parachute. A few seconds later \
the head of a man was seen, followed al
most instantly by the entire iigure. The
crowd gazed in wonder and awe at the
gyrations of the "man in the clouds." Few
realized that it was but a fanciful trick of
the little men from the island empire.
The Ninth Division.
The trite saying, "Last but not least,"
applied with force to the ninth division.
While no great pretense was made at dis
play, it was replete with charming features
and patriotism galore. The officers were:
James H. Humphries, marshal; Charles
Bliss, chief aid ; James Curlett and Dr. C. L.
Scharff, aids. The line formed on Second
street, and at the proper time fell in with
the main procession.
First came Eoert's band of sixteen
pieces and then a float, "Protecting the
Flag," drawn by two splendid mastiffs.
Then the school children made their pres
ence known. The float, "Marriage of ;
Pocanontas," portrayed Dy pupils of the I
James Lick Bchool, proved to be a very !
pretty j iece. Following this came the
South Cosmopolitan School, representing
the Army Hospital Corps. It was a pretty
scene, was this floating tavern for the
sick. Pretty maids, with dainty head
dress and neat white aprons, looked per
fectly the parts they assumed. The lads
and lassies on the floats were Sidney Gold
man, Edward Abenheim, Joe Schoenfeld, i
Adolph Reusen, Charlie Reusen, Her: crt
Levy, Miss Florence Milne and Miss Annie '
More.
"Where are you going, my pretty maid ?"
might very well have been said to Miss
Maggie Fitzpatrick, who posed as a dairy
maid for a popular ranch, clad in flowing i
red, white and blue, with a wealth of j
golden hair peeping saucily from under a
jaunty Tarn o' Shanter. Miss Fiizpatrick
was a perfect poet's dream of a dairy maid. I
Following this float came carriages bear- !
ing City, State and other officials, the
whole ending with a long ling of enter
prising advertisers, and socialists bearing
banners of very socialistic characters.
LITERARY
EXERCISES.
ABOUT two thousand occupied seats in
the Auditorium, corner of Eddy and
Jones streets, dnring the afternoon to
enjoy the literary and musical exercises.
Everywhere in streamers, festoons, ban
ners and drapery the red, white and blue
in stars and stripes met tbe eye. On the
platform sat the Goddess of Liberty and
"California," one of her most glorious
offspring, in company with the officers
and committee members of the celebra
tion.
A medley of national airs comprised the
overture, which was rendered with all the
high ability at command of the Tivoii or
chestra.
Rabbi Voorsanger followed with a
prayer, whose appositeness and eloquence
evoked the unexpected and unique dis
tinction of applause.
Twenty lady soloists sane the "Star j
Spangled Banner 1 ' with fine effect under
the direction of John W. McKenzie Jr.
Included in this selected chorus were the
following:
Mrs. W. A. Margo, Mrs. James Igo, Mrs.
G. Mublner, Mrs. L. Lampe, Mrs. H. Gri
nelle, Mrs. A. Poulson, Mrs. A. Hall, Mrs.
J. Pettee, Mrs. A. Sorenson, Mrs. L.

nell, Miss J. Larsen, Miss V. Rappin, Miss
M. V. Brednll, Miss R. Pelton, Miss K.
Kelly, Miss H. Frazier, Miss M. Leipsic,
Miss T. Rosenbohm.
Samuel L. Lent, president of the day, in
his brief address thanked the audience for
their attendance, the citizens for their lib- i
erality and patriotism in aiding to make
the celebration a success and the various
sub-committees for their onerous and
faithfully performed labors.
In introducing John R. Robinson, an
aged and silver-haired gentleman who bad
evidently passed the Biblical limit of three
score and ten, President Lent announced
that the reader of the Declaration of
Independence was a son of a Revolution
ary officer, Noel Robinson, and gave a
brief biographical history of the latter, in
cluding his war record. Mr. Robinson's
reading had all the patriotic fervor that
was to be expected from the descendant of I
one â sv.ho bad by tbe prowess of his arm
aided to make that famous propaganda of !
the colonies the beacon light of freedom
loving people throughout the world for
the past 120 years.
The poem composed for the occasion by
Louis A. Robertson was read with dra
matic effect by Professor E. Knowlton.
The president of the day stated that out of
139 poems submitted to the literary com- j
mittee the one by Louis A. Robertson had j
been unanimously selected as undoubtedly
possessing the most merit.
Professor Knowlton's advance to the
front of the platform was greeted with ap
piause.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "as a
preface to the reading of my poem let me
stale that there is one peculiar fact in con
nection witn the ages of the reader of the
Declaration of Independence and of this
poem.
"These combined a-es are"â (turning
toward John R. Robinson) â "shall I
tell it?"
Receiving an affirmative nod he finished
the sentence â "one hundred and forty-two
years." At the conclusion of the reading
the house shook with cheers and other
hianifestations of applause.
Tne "Flag of LiDerty," a song arranged
by J. W. McKenzie Jr., from the celebrated
"Father of Victory" March and dedicated
to the Native Sons, was sung by a cho rus
of 200 voices. The song was encored.
In introducing the orator of the day
President Lent said that an effort had been
made to have all the performers of the oc
casion men and women who could easily
trace their ancestry back to revolutionary
times. In this, he said, they had been
highly successful, and especially in the
case of Zenas IT. Dodge, who could trace
his ancestry back to the year 16: M and
naroe many forefathers who took part in
the thrilling events succeeding this period.
The orator was frequently interrupted in
his rhetorical flights by spontaneous out
bursts of applause from his audience, and
at its close the audible evidence of their
approbation was deafening. The follow
ing were the speaker's words:
This is a day when we entwine the sweet,
ever-lingering memories of courage and devo
tion with the clinging, loving folds of our red,
white and blue.
Friends, we are here this afternoon filled
with kindred feelings of piide and love ol
country. As our National anthems were dis
coursed in symphony and song, and as I lis
tened to the reading of that grandest, bravest
and profoundest document ever written and
signed by the representatives of a people, the
Declaration of Independence, a panorama of
events spread out before my mental vision.
A panorama that led up step by step, incident
by incident, through sufferings, sacrifices and
struggles, through carnage and blood, to tbat
supreme moment when that little band of
heroes, knowing well that their act meant a
long, terrible and bloody war, yet, with a dash
of the pen, gave to the world a home for the
oppressed of other nations; gave a birthright
to liberty, and a sanctuary wherein to worship
(i.).i without fear. And as I sat there I became
awed at the comprehensiveness of the subject.
I did not feel it within the power of man to
worthily voice utterances calculated to do jus
tice to a theme so sanctified by the blood of
our fathers; a theme bo hallowed in undying
memories; a theme clothed in immortality.
We shall not legislate this atternoon, nor air
private opinions, nor instruct the next Con
gress or Legislature, nor attempt to correct
any of the existing abuses of law or of right.
All such matters shall be left to those in whom
we see fit to repose our confidence at the
proper time and in the proper place. To-day
any sentiment approaching the present condi
tion of local or even National matters would
illy become the spirit of this celebration. It is
to Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Hancock,
Franklin, Hamilton and other patriots; it is to
the Declaration of Independence and the he
roes who fought and bled to establish, main
tain and perpetuate its principles; it is to the
stars and stripes that we give this day over to
rejoicing and thanksgiving.
Friends, it is a good thing that we are creat
ures of sentiment. It was sentiment that drove
our Pilgrim Fa thers to the rock-bound New
England shores; It was sentiment that caused
the old Liberty Bell to ring out "Liberty
throughout the land unto all the inhabitants j
thereof;" it was sentiment that gave to the i
world our immortal Washington; it was sen- j
timent that arrayed brother against brother i
and father against son in the late great war of
principle; it is sentiment that brings us here
to-day.
This sentiment of independence, springing '
directly from nature and nature's God, having j
its birih in oppression, rearing its head first
out of religious intolerance and bigotry,
planted the colonies of the New World; threw
off the yoke of British oppression and j
allegiance ; defied the power of kings and their j
ministers; proclaimed that in the people was I
the fountain head of power; proclaimed every j
man equal in right to life, liberty and pursuit
of happiness. It was sentiment that gave us a
man whose name time can never efface from
the honor roll of our Nation ; a man who loved j
America better than his fortune; a man who '
loved liberty better than his life. All honor to |
the memory of Lafayette. It was this sentiment j
of independence that sharpened our swords ;
and pointed our bayonets in all our battles
and thundered to the world our Declaration of :
Independence.
I will tread very lightly and quickly over [
the span of liiO years of our Nation's existence. !
England reluctantly conceded to the United ]
States their independence, won on tbe battle
fields of the Revolution. Our fathers emerged
from their arduous, protracted, desolating
revolutionary struggle, poor, indeed, in word ly j
goods. Habits of Industry had been unsettled by '
the anxieties and uncertainties of war. Selfish !
passion had taken the place of that spirit of free
dom which had characterized the colonists at
the commencement of their struggle for inde
pendence. A country without money, without
credit; its people writhing under the intol
erable pressure of debt : with industrial paraly- !
sis, commercial embarrassment, political dis- |
order, cried aloud for that calm, commanding, j
irresistible Washington; and though he had '
retired to the peaceful and quiet retreat at
Mount Vernon, yet he heard the voice of his i
country and obeyed. That voice was to him as
the voice of his God.
Through the wisdom, prudence and devotion
of Washington and his compeers our Nation
was raised out of the darkness of poverty and
despair into the bright dawn of one of the
moat successful eras ever recorded in the his
tory of the nations of the world. Horace
Greeley, in speaking of thia remarkable epoch 1
of progress, said :
"Our country of to-day owes its unequaled I
growth aud progress, its population, produc
tiveness and wealth, primarily to tho trainers
of the Federal constitution, by which its de
velopment was rendered possible; but more
Immediately and palpably to the sagacity and
statesmanship of Jefferson, the purchaser of
Louisiana; to the genius of Fitch and Fulton,
the projector and achiever, respectively, of
steam navigation ; to De Witt Clinton, the !
early, unswerving and successful champion j
of artificial inland navigation, and to Henry
Clay, the eminent, eloquent and effective
champion of the diversification of our Na
tional industry through the protection of home
manufactures."
Although the War of the Revolution was at
an end, the warclouds had not yet entirely dis
appeared. The pirates of the Barbary States
harassed our shipping. Spain refused us nav
igation of the Mississippi, and England had
not yet condescended to make a treaty of com- I
merce with us. Congress agreed to assume the
debt contracted by the States during the Revo
lution, and to pay the National debt in full.
Then it was that that great financier, Hamil
ton, of whom was said, "He smote the rock of
National resources and abundant streams of j
revenue burst forth; he touched the dead
corpse of public credit and it sprang upon its
feet," put for the first time into practice our
great principles of protection by levying taxes
upon imported goods. The development of
the interior resources of our country, the
building up of its industries, the establishment
of its credit; the demand and due recognition
of respect, brought about principally by the
War of 1812, placed the United States
in a position to put imo opera
tion the great principles of independence they
had co hardly won, and which were subse
quently crystallized in the Monroe doctrine,
the most momentous document which had
been offered since that of the Declaration of
Independence. While the Declaration of In
dependence made us a Nation, the Monroe
doctrine, as has been said, sets our compass
and points a course which we are to steer
through the ocean of time opening before us,
and while Europe is laboring to become the j
domicile of despotism, our endeavor should be
to make our hemisphere that ol Freedom.
The Declaration of Independence is our God
dess of Libertyâ under her munificent shield
we are the happiest among the peoples of the
earth; while the Monroe doctrine, assuming
form under her majestic protecting wings out
stretched over the Western Hemisphere, is the
embodiment of the cherished sentiments of
the citizens of the United States for the liberty {
and happiness of their fellow-men, and em
phasizes the motto, "America for Americans."
To-day we are listening to a still small
knocking at the aoor of the sisterhood of re
publics. One hundred and twenty years ago
the souls of our fathers were tried as are those,
who, to-day, are struggling for liberty on that
little Isle of Cuba. When the battle clouds
â oil away may their flag of freedom kiss that
breeze which unfurls our banner to the air.
Although we now honor freedom's natal
day and the heroes of that time, I proclaim
that we have heroes to-day who would will- |
ingly place themselves on the altar of their
country. We have mothers, wives anl sisters]
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1896.
HYMN TO FREEDOM,
Blood-bought, and yet the price was freely paid,
As many a crimsoned battlefield could tell;
And thunder tread of war, and clash of blade,
And the clad clanging birthsong of a bell;
Tlien one bright torch that blazed above the gloom.
As Liberty leaped forth and sealed Oppression's doom.
The grit and grandeur of the men who poured
Their blood to buy this priceless heritage;
They, whose quick hands ne'er trifled with the sword,
Nor trembled when they signed the chartered page,
Sleep in the soil they saved, and yet they rise
And look on us to-day with stern, demanding eyes.
What were it worth, this birthright of the free,
If we, as careless keepers of the trust,
The byword of a world, at las', should be?
Ye glib-tonsrued sophists! shall our sabers rust?
Beware, ye Babel builders, lest these towers
That climb to kiss the stars should fall when treason glowers.
What can we claim, when in the scales of God
We throw the patriot prestige of the past?
Our fathers' blood, lone si!ent in the sod,
Beerins to mourn: Yea, though this day we cast
Into the balance every deathless name
That lights our sacred scroll, what glory can we claim
If we, as watchers of a Nation's fate,
While all our skies above are rainbow-spanned,
Forget the stealthy foe within our gate,
And the broad, rugged creed our fathers planned ;
What were it worth, this liberty we boast,
If rank corruption's growth, should spread from coast to coast?
Such fears are vain; the silent hero clay
That stood our bulwark oft against the foe,
Would rise to save its country from decay,
Did such a deadly upas o'er it grow ;
But never shall its poisoned branches spread
Their blasting shade above the soil that holds such dead.
What time a deadlier devastating blight
Than this, or any country ever knew,
Dared lift its ghastly features to the light.
A million blades 'round Freedom's banner drew;
And now, should treason come with all its hordes,
The insensate grass we tread would glisten into swords.
So. slumber on, ye brave, and have no fear;
We stand beside our wetcb fires, and our eyes.
Fixed on God's changeless stars, see shining clear
The light that saves. Yea, we shall realize
The faith-framed fabric of your morning dream,
And clasp the captured grail, to guide us with its gleam.
For, as our fathers did, we trust in Thee,
Great God of nations! and we rest secure.
Our eyes behold across Time's troublous sea
A Pharos flaming high above the roar
Of baffling tempest and ot changing tide,
Triumphat type that tells of wrecking storms defied.
â Louis A. Robertson.

our Revolution.
I am pleased here to quote a few lines from
a speech of one of the most patriotic and elo
quent men of America living to-day. I refer
to Colonel Robert G. Ineersoll. While we may
not agree with Colonel Injtersoll upon matters
of religion, BtlU I know we all agree with him
irhen he says:
"All who stand beneath our banner are free.
Ours is the only flag which has In reality
written upon it 'Liberty, fraternity, equal
ity' â the three grandest words In all the
languages of man.
"Libertyâ Give to every man the fruit of his
own labor, the fruiis of his hands and of his
biain.
"Fraternityâ Every man In the right Is my
brother.
"EquaHtyâ The rights of all are equal: Jus
tice, poised and talanced In eternal claim,
shall shake from the golden scales in which
Â»re weighed the acts of men the very dust of
prejudice and caste: no race, no color, no pre
cious condition c,an change the rights of man."
In these few words Colonel Ingersoll has
touched the very heartstrings of the princi
ples which underlie our political government;
they are the conditions which cause every
American's heart to throb In response to the
trust of citiÂ«en*hip.
Our Star-Spangled Banner, our beautiful
Bmblem of liberty, we consecrate ourselves to
thee this day. Our pride at home, our protec
tion abroad; undaunted at perils by land or
by sea, tender and merciful in thy all-con
juerinir force; the hope of our living, the
tvlnding-Bheet of our dead. Thou goddess of
freedom, thou empress of 70,000,000 souls
tvho would pour out their life's-blood to-day
upon thy pyre, if to quench the flame that
ivould tarnish thy luster or defame thy fair
same! Thy subjects are we all.
O thou flag of ours! Thou who hast been
ihrough victory aud defeat; thou who hast
ivitne.^sed untold sufferings at the hearthstone
md oti the battleground; thou who has stood
>ponsor to unswerving devotion; thou upon
tvhom fell the last dying gaze of our Boys in
Blue; thou for whom the pulses of millions
luicken to-day and whose praises sound from
millions of throats! O thou flag of oursl
tladst thou a tongue to-day what couldst thou
ipeak? Haast thou tears to-day wouldst thou
not weep in joy?
This Is an hour with God and with our coun
try. This is an hour when, temporal matters
laid aside, we weave and weave again
memory's eternal garlands. Tenderly and lov
ingly we place them on the brows of our mar
tyred fathers. In silence and In tears, with
jreater love for the flag and for the country
they gave us, we kiss their scars, humbly and
reverently, and turn our faces toward another
sun, whose rays shall warm aud lighten a .Na
tion made greater and nobler for this day's
communion with the dead, yet ever-living,
Â»ye , immortal, past.
Then the curtain dropped, closing those
on the stage from the view of the audience.
It was known that the next item on the
programme was to be a patriotic tableau,
and the audience waited with keen expect
ancy. The curtain rose amid such silence
that one could almost hear a pin drop.
. There in the center of the stage stood
the father of his country robed in martial
array, while around htm stood his staff
attired in the same garb.
Over to the left of the stage stood the
radiant Goddess of Liberty with her right
hand steadying the pole from which
floated the emblem of the Union.
On the left was stacked an array of
muskets, symbolic of the stormy Revolu
tionary period.
As tbe red light glared up brightly and
threw the scene into prominence, then
softened to a mellower tint and cast
shadows flickering hither and thither, the
audience could no longer restrain its en
thusiasm, but rent the air with thunderous
bursts of applause.
Just at this period the American flag, so
large that it could have been used as a
stage curtain, was slowly let down behind
the group, and at sight of its broad red
and white bands and forty-live golden
stars in a blue field, that vast assemblage
limply shouted itself hoarse.
When thp enthusiasm of tbe house was
somewhat subdued by the falling of the
:urtain, all united in singing "America,"
md tbe assemblage was dismissed by
Rabbi Voorsanger pronouncing the bene-
iiction.
FIREWORKS IN
A DENSE FOG.
THE magnificent display of the day
was fittingly ended by the fireworks
in the evening out near the end of
the Haight-street line.
Cable-cars have been crowded before
[ this time, but it is safe to assert that never
I in the history of the City were so many
human beings crammed into a car as they
were last evening. The proverbial sardine
simile would be a poor comparison.
Men and women clung to the seats, the
railinss, to each other and anything else
on which they could lay hold. Boys
crowded in between their elders' feet aiia
hune on like monkeys. Even the roofs of
the cars were made to do service as seats
for these youthful Americans. They
dropped bunches of firecrackers all along
the track and many kept discharging re
volvers loaded with blank cartridees.
At the scene of the fireworks much of
the brilliancy of the spectacle was ob
scured by a'thiek fog. Ho dense was it
that at a short distance the electric lights
gleamed like stars, the poles being invisi
ble.
Still, the spectacle was full of grandeur.
As the fiery rockets wormed their sinuous
way into the air, the bombs rose to a
height and burst to pieces, the great pin
wheels pirouetted and cast off myriads of
sparks and the Roman candles cast their
vari-colored eloDes of flame hitner and
thither, the vast htiman assemblage would
rend the air with cheer on cheer. Tbe fog
dampened everything but the people's
ardor.
The most excellent features of the
evening were the representation upon wire
frames of the faces of revolutionary
patriots, the liberty bell and stirring his
toric American scenes.
About half-past 9 o'clock the Haight
street cable snapped and rendered it use
less till very late. Everybody was obliged
to walk a good distance to catch other
lines and get back to town.
Thus ended the celebration of the natal
day of the Nation. The old-timers unani
mously admit that it was the liveliest they
have seen in many years.
INJURED CELEBRATED
Quite a Number of Men and
Boys Treated for
Burns.
The Lively Firecracker Claimed Some
Victims From the Noise-
Makers.
The doctors at the Receiving Hospital
were, as usual, kept busy all day yester
day attending to men and boys who had
been injured through the careless use of
firecrackers. Fortunately none o! the
canes were serious.
The first to arrive was P. Griffin, 31 Oak
j street, a few minutes before 10 o'clock.
! He had powder burns on his face, caused
by the premature explosion of a cracker.
William McNaniee, 1 Fifth street, had
powder burns in his eyes from a similar
cause. Robert Miller, a boy, living at 225
Tehama street, was using a toy pistol and
it exploded too soon and wounded his leit
hand.
In the afternoon Laser Blum, a boy
living at 8 Grove street, held a firecracker
too long in his left hand, which was
burned. Harry McGlaufiin, GW> Minna
street, had his eyes and face filled with
burned powder through the premature
explosion of a "redhead,'' and Fred
Smith, a boy living at 1427 Mission street,
was m a similar predicament.
Last night Willie Brown, a boy living at
Gl3 Mission -in-et, was loading a cannon
when it exploded and burned his hands,
face and legs. George Connors, a boy liv
ing at 1410 Kearny street, picked up a
bomb from the street and it exploded,
burning both his hands. John McDon
ald, a boy living at 508 Noe street, bad
both of liis eyes burned by the premature

HARDY IS KING
OF THE COURT,
Tennis Championship of
the Pacific Coast
Decided.
WHITNEY GIVES BATTLE
Valiant But Ineffectual Effort to
Defeat the Oakland
Boy.
YOUTH AND BEAUTY APPLAUD.
Fashion's Votaries Assemble at San

Sam Hardy is the champion tennis
player of the Pacific Coast. The plucky
young player achieved this honor yester
day afternoon on the courts of Hotel
Rafael, and when the ball had ended the
journey across the net that decided the
Sam Hardy, Who Yesterday Earned the Title of Champion Tennis-Player of the Pacific States ; George
F. Whitney, Winner of the Runner-up Prize, and R. N. Whitney, President of the Pacific
States Lawn Tennis Association.
REVIEW BY PRESIDENT WHITNEY.
The tournament is over and the result was hardly ever in doubt, Mr. Sam Hardy,
the new champion, winning the set without losing a set. This is in itself a remark
ble performance. The standard of play as evinced in this tournament shows a
marked improvement and the tendency seems to be to return toward a back-court
game.
Many new, promising players appeared in this tournament, which augurs well for
the game in the future. Taken as whole the tournament was a decided success. Too
much credit cannot be given the runner-up, Mr. George Whitney, for his determined
stand against great odds in the final match and bis performance brands him as a
player of thefirst class. R. N. Whitney,
President of the Pacific States' Lawn Tennis Asssociation.
Oakland youth a winner, 300 fair summer
maidens applauded with ali the vigor pos
sible to white-gloved hands, and as many
gorgeously arrayed young men made
knowing comments about the game and
joined in the demonstration so far as they
considered consistent with their efforts to
be fashionably biase.
It was a great day for tennis, especially
the forenoon. Then the sun shone just
warm enough to make pleasure-seekers
rejoice that they were not suffering from
the limitations of four walls, and there
was not too much heat for the comfort of
players or spectators at the game.
As anticipated, the crowd was not so
large at the courts in the forenoon as that
which came later. The events of the morn
ing were but semi-finals. The grand con
test of the meet was to be the all-comers'
final of the afternoon.
In spite of other attractions the seats of
the grand stand were well filled. A num
ber of people wno had come down the
night before or early yesterday morning
patronized the forenoon sport, and they
were well repaid.
Among them was V. Artzimovicb, the
Russian Consul, who occupied a seat in
the grand-stand. Arthur Allen, a con
testant of former years, explained to a
bevy of fair damsels the fine points of the
game. John F. Bheehan Jr. and \Vilham
H. Harrelson, who were once quite promi
nent on the courts at Stanford, but still
better known as baseball players, watched
the play with interest. Other prominent
spectators were: Ernest C. Peixotto. Mrs.
Folper of Oakland, George T. Cameron,
J, Hubert Mcc, the Misses Hush, Mr. and
Mrs. William Magee, Miss Koniie Wal
lace, John F. Archibald, Senator Frank C.
De Long. Frank McLennan, George H.
Gardner of East Oakland, Miss Reillv of I
Oakland. W. H. Hynesof Oakland, W. O.
Cooke, J. M. Anginano, W. G. Morrow
and wife and Gustavus R. Madden.
The first match of the day was between
George Whitney and T. A. Driscoll. Whit
ney bad little difficulty in winning. Dris
coll, as was expected, showed poor form, |
and in the second set came very near
being shut out without a game. As it was !
the score stood tiâ 3, Gâ l.
The secoud match of the forenoon was
in some respects the contest of the tourna
ment. R. N. Whitney was up against i
Bam Hardy and a hard fight was expected.
The first set seemed to indicate a miscal
culation. Hardy managed to be every
where at once, and the ease with which he
stopped Whitney's hard drives rather dis
couraged his opponent. The harder Whit
ney drove them the cooler Hardy got, and
his well-placed returns were marvels. The
set ended six love, Hardy leading.
When Whitney entered the courts for
the second set lie had undergone a great
change. He commenced sending his
wicked drives at his opponent with a force
and precision that perturbed even the
non-excitable Hardy. Before the young
man from Oakland had quite collected
himself the scorer was singing "Four
love, Whitney leading,' which to the in
itiate means four games for Whitney to
none for Hardy.
Then Hardy commenced to play tennis
as only he can play. He didn't succeed in
rattling Whitney again, but he did suc
ceed in putting up a winning game. It
was necessary to play two additional
games to decide the set, Hardy finally
winning by a score of Bâ6.
Those two matches were the only semi
finals to be decided and the results Jeft
Georee Whitney and Sam Hardy to con
test for the first prize ot the tournament, a
Columbia bicycle, and by the default of
the present champion, Sumner Hardy,
who is in Alaska, the championship of the
Pacific States.
It was 2:45 when the final match was
called. The grandstand, commanding a
view of the court upon which the tourna
ment was held, was full beyond its normal
capacity, and chairs and benches were
crowded into every available shady nook.
A flutter of excitement was caused when
the heroes of the racquet crossed the court
on their way to the dressing-room, and
their appearance was the signal for most
reckless gambling.
One charming enthusiast announced
triumphantly to a party of her young lady
friends that she was willing to bet a box
of candy against a Queen Charlotte. Her
offer was hesitatingly taken up by a com
panion, and then they set about picking
their men. Four times they swapped
champions, odds always remaining the
same, and then the challenger, because
the man she thought the Dest looking was
not the one she thought would win, de
clared the bet off: that she
knew it was wrong to bet, but it made the
game so much more exciting.
At the outset of the final it looked as if
Whitnev was going to stampede Hardy.
George Whitney, like his brother Rob, has
a wicked wav of driving the balls, hard
and swift, just over the top of the set, and
even as adroit a player as Sam Hardy
doesn't fancy that sort of thing.
For a while Whitney's drives were very
effective, but he couldn't hold himself to
gether properly. Hardy apparently sized
him up after the first two or three games,
and he commenced playing rapidly.
Whitney was soon in distress, and before
the first" set was over he was tired and dis
couraged. He made a game fight, how
ever, and showed conclusively that when
experience has taught him "to keep his
nerves steady he wiil be a dangerous "rival
for any player.
Toward the last of the match he made a
final stand and some brilliant playing re
suited. Hardy's remarkable nerve and
precision, nowever, always stood him well
in hand in a rally, aod by one of the
cleverest strokes in the tournament he
won the final game and became the
chamnion.
George Whitney, the "runner-up," re
ceived a handsome cut glass pitcher
valued at $50, as the reward for being
second in the tournament. Hardy received
a Columbia bicycle.
Most of the guests stayed at the hotel last
evening and participated in a grand
Fourth of July ball given by the manage -
ment.
WAR OF THE MINT MEN.

The official orders from the Secretary of

all tbe employes of other Federal depart
ments not heretofore in the classified ser
vice are expected here during this week.
Among the Democratic politicians the
removal of a small army of political work
ers from the battlefield is the phase of the
civil service business of the most interest.
It is of special interest to the opponents of
Daggett and Rainey in the Junta organi
zation, and it is now proposed by Samuel
Braunbart, R. L. Mann and other anti-
Raineyites to force some forty Federal em
ployes to resign from the General Commit
tee and to cease displaying offensive parti
sanship.
Nearly all the Federal employes are
j politicians. They got their jobs, as a rule,
by being politicians. This is especially
the case in the Mint. Daggett's local ap
pointments have been made to help him
self and Sara control the machine and op
erate it. The men he has put into places
have nearly all been men of active influ
ence in their aistricts, and a small army

Junta General Committee, voting and in
fluencing others in the interest of Daggett
and Rainey.
A chance to remove this strong element
from the organization seems to have ap
peared, and war to that end has been de
clared. It is proposed, for one thing, to
have the campaign committee demand
the resignation of Federal employes. An
other weapon will be the threat that if
these men do not resign and keep out of
factional fights and quit wording for polit
ical bosses they will be complained of to
I the Civil Service Commission and their
jobs put in jeopardy.
If the*e removals are accomplished the
voting strength of the Rainey-Dageett
faction will not be changed much, because
i in districts where that faction is in control
j friends would be elected to the vacancies,
| but what would be accomplished would be
the weakeniog of the Rainey-Daggett side
by the removal from the committee of in
j fluential men who are directly controlled
i and who directly exprcise their influence.
Among the Federal employes in tbe
General Committee are many friends of
the anti-Rainey element, but the great
majority are Rainev-Daggett workers and
twenty-three have jobs in the Mint. The

JUBILEE REVEL
AT MONTEREY,
Native Daughters Preside
Over Fourth of July
Festivities.
BEAUTY IN A PARADE.

Procession.

MONTEREY, Cal., July 4--The cele
bration of California's jubiless opened to
day. It was woman's day, although the
observance assumed a dual character for
the Fourth and the beginning of the cere
monies that are to mark tbe fiftieth anni
versary of the hoisting of the National
nag in California. The day was given
over entirely to the Native Daughters,
who, with very clear rights, claimed it as
their own, and the Native Daughters were
consequently happy that after half a cen
tury they, the offspring of the pioneers,
should thus take part in tbe commemora
tion so full oi meaning for all Californians,
if not, indeed, for every citizen of the
United States.
The celebration began at 10 a. m., when
crowds of Montereyans and their neigh
bors filled the grand stand of Lyceum
Park and the enclosures to witness a mili
tary spectacle new to many of them. The
first event on the programme comprised a
series of maneuvers by Cavalry Troop C of
Salinas under command of Captain M. J.
Burke.
At noon the United States ships Phila
delphia and MonadnocK in the bay, with
their signal flags fluttering in the breeze,
fired a salute. The echoes of the old hills
were rudely awakened by this crash of
great euns as they had not been for many
a long year.
All other ceremonies were under the
auspices of the Grand Parlor of the Native
Daughters, whose officers are: Urand pres
ident, Mrs. Mary E. Tillman; grand vice
president, Mrs. Belle Conrad; grand sec
retary, Mrs.Georgia Cotter-Ryan, and grand
treasurer, Mrs. Inge P. Faures. There

was a parade through the main streets in ;
the afternoon, and in this feature the
United States sailors and two companies
of the Fifth United States Artillery, \
camped at Del Monte, overshadowed every- i
thing.
Tbe procession was led by M;s. Stead
man, who, as grand marshal, roue a white
horse. She wore a red and white sash and j
a black riding costume. In the front came
the Fifth Artillery, with its guns and j
caissons, the like of which had not been
seen in Monterey since the ancient Spaa- '

ish cannon were hauled to the fort over
topping the city.
The sailors appeared in white duck
suits, with their rifles, and marched in
double platoons, headed by the marine
band.
Cavalry Troop C, N. G. C, of Salinas,
was next in line, as an escort for the God
dess of Liberty, Miss Ingram, with the
stars and stripes draped around her. She
occupied an elevated position on a float
drawn by two government mules, led by
two soldiers. The Monterey Fire Depart
ment followed, all in neat blue uniforms,
and then came the beautiful living fla?.
representing the stars and stripes, by
children dressed in red or white or blue
and arranged like the National emblem,
with a row of young women in yellow at
one side to represent the staff. They
were applauded all along the line of
march. The procession closed with a long
row of carriages containing ladies and
gentlemen.
No sooner had the crowd fairly settled
in and around the grand stand opposite
the old Mexican Custom-bouse than the
literary exercises beean. 8. J. Duckworth,
the leading spirit of the celebration, intro
duced Miss Orton, who delivered an ad
dress of welcome to the Native Daughters.
She in turn introduced Miss E. A. Spencer
of Eureka, Cal., past grand president of
the Native Daughters, who was president
of the day. In behalf of the Grand Parlor,
N. D. G. W., Miss Spencer thanked the
local parlor for the reception.
Miss Clara Wittenmeyer pronounced an
eloquent prayer and Esther Malcolm-
Johnson read a poem, after which the
children composing the living flag sang
"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean." Miss
Marian B?rtola of Martinez delivered an
address. The Philadelphia band played
"Marching Through Georgia," and Miss
Agnes Manning of San Francisco read an
able essay on "Monterey Under tbe Span
ish Kegiuie." Tbe band played "Yankee

Doodle," and Miss Eliza Keith spoke on
â¢Patriotism in the Public Schools."
"The highest form of a nation," said
Mrs. Keith, "is one where the people form
and maintain a government strong enoueh
to punish criminals, regulate society, pro
tect its citizens in all their rights. y*t
powerless to do any harm to its own law
abiding people. Such a Nation is our
great republic, the United States.
"Unrestricted immigration threatens to
arrest the develos>ment of this highest
type of Americanism. We have already
received more foreign elements than we
can assimilate. The foreign-born and
their immediate descendants already ex
ceed the native-born north of Mason and
Dixon's line. Ar the oresent time there
are over 2,000.000 idle laborers in the
United States; and yet immigrants, the
very offscourings >'f Europe, are flocking
to our shore? at the rate of 30,000 a month.
We want no more assisted immigrants,
whether they come to marry an American
heiress or to grind an organ. This is
America, and we propose to keep it so.
"There should be no such thing as the
foreign vote. Only American citizens
have a right to vote, and why insult an
elector by branding him as a half-and-half
American? No one should ask a cit-zen
of foreign birth to forget his own home,
but we do insist that he shall remember it
in his prayers and not in his politics.
"As Americans, we can tolerate the pres
ence of no class or clan or sect among us
that is antagonistic to American princi
ples. No other language than the mother
tougne of our Nation, the English lan
guage, should be accepted as a vehicle for
national or municipal expression. Un-
American influence should be cast out
from our public places, particularly from
our public schools.
"Education for American citizenship
must begin with the child at school. Nay,
I am wrong; it must begin earlier than
that. Every American mother must make
of her child a baby patriot, proud of the
tiny American flag which she pins on his
breast as she takes him to see his first
Fourth of July procession."
Mrs. Keith made an eloquent plea for
Government control of schools. "The
conviction grows," said she, "that tbe
National Government should have control
of the public schools, reducing the un
even and conflicting local system to an
educational uniformity and* raising the
standard. The Nation educates her sol
diers and her tailors; why not her future
citizens? The National Government should
supervise all public schools in the United
States. All private institutions of learn
ine, whether they be denominational or
non-sectarian, should regulate their course
of study and furnish a national, non
partisan textbook upon rights, duties and
responsibilities of American citizenship."
The marine musicians rendered
"America," that resounded with powerful
effect upon the drowsy bay, over the
adobes of another age and tbe romantic
hills. A picture, at that moment singu
larly impressive and beautiful, could be
seen by any one there with eyes to see â
the blue bay, with the great white men-of
war and iheir gay bunting ana flags, the
historical shores and hills, old Monterey,
with its Mexican adobes, and nearer the
crowd of new people and the school chil
dren with American flags, while beyond,
silhouetted against the summer sky,
stood the status ol Padre Serra, the mis
sionary, the beacon light in Monterey's
history.
The ceremonies came to a close with a
benediction by Miss Clara Wittenmeyer.
In the tvenins there was a ball in the
Pavilion and a dance and reception by the
Monterey firemen.
The climax of the day's festivities was
the Fourth of July ball at the Hotel del
Monte. Like all the other features of the
celebration, the affair was open to all vis
itors to the historic city. A number of
State officers were expected, but failed to
come. Ti.elr presence was missed, of
course, but in no way did their absence
interfere with the joy of the dances.
The pretty ballroom never looked pret
tier than it did to-niL-ht. The decorations
were all in the national colors, ana the
graceful draping of bunting harmonized
perfectly with t c beautiful costumes worn
by the ladies. There were at least 200
dancers on the floor at one time, and all
enjoyed themselves to the highest ex
treme. All the officers of the warship
Philadelphia and Mouadnock and Cora
panics D and F of the Light Artillery
were also present, including Admiral
Beaidsiee, Captain Stoney and Colonel
Davis.
WHRELMES RULE. AT EUREKA.
Cyclers Have Charge of the Natal- Hay
Festivities.
EUREKA, Cal., July 4.â This year's
celebration in Eureka was in the hands of
local wheelmen. They performed their
task well. A ball given by the Eureka
Road Club last night ushered in the natal
day festivities.
The parade to-day formed in front of the
courthouse at 9:30 o'clock, and took up the
line of march. It wa3 led by Marsbal Cut
ler and aids, and comprised the fire de
partment, Naval Reserve, business floats
and fraternal and civic societies, followed
by a large number of wheelmen in club
uniform and riding finely decorated
wheels. Long before the procession had
reached Armory Hall, where the literary
and musical exercises were held, a dense
throng had filled the hall. Lawrence F.
Puter was orator of the day. His talk
was original and entertaining.
Celebrations were held to-day at Scotia,
Blue Lake and Bayside. Scotia was the
scene of the large-t picnic held for many
years in Hum bold t County. It was given
under the auspices of the County Amer
ican Protective Association. State Presi
dent Rev. B. F. Hudelson delivered an
address.
The races this afternoon were hotly con
tested. The mile novice was won by R.
Ohman in 2:27; the half-mite scratch by
R. Ohman in 1:07; the mile handicap by
Fred Hauck, scratch, in 2:22 3-5; the
quarter-mile scratch by Fred Hauck in

BAKERSFIELD'S PARADE.
Pretty Maidt Enthroned Upon Gayly
Itecorcted Floats.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., July 4â An im
mense crowd, a three-quarter mile pro
cession, including militia from the valley
towns to the north, with their respective
bands, floats representing Columbia, Cali
fornia and Kern County, patriotic music,
tbe reading of the declaration and an ad
dress dealing with the industrial situation
from an anti-monopoly standpoint, a bar
becue, balloon ascension, fireworks, bi
cycle races and a grand ball in the new
courthouse, were the features of the day at
Bakersfield.
Miss Fannie Maio, as Columbia, was en
throned upon a white float, canopied with
pampas plumes and drawn by white
horses. Tho float designated as Califor
nia, Miss Edna Coons goddess, was of a
yellow tone, and Miss Flora Willow as
Kern County, satin a silver moon on a

was painfully, though not seriously, in
jured by some one sitting on the fence en
circling the course putting out his foot.
Logan was strucK in the lower part of the
abdomen and soon after the race a physi
i cian was summoned from San Rafael. It i
was thought that bis injury is not serious.

WOK BY THE GRAY GHOST
Waldo J Drew the Po'e Position
and Downed W. Wood
With Ease.
A BIG CROWD SAW THE SPORT
The Palo Alto Entry, Helena, Took
the 2:19 Trotâ Mr. Schrsder's
Cigar and the Butchers' Race.
The closing day of the race meeting held
at Ingledide track by the Pacific Coast
Trottine-horse Breeders' Association was
attended by over 3000 people, notwith
standing the many counter attractions the
glorious Fourth offered. The fair sex was
well represented and tne male portion of
the crowd was there with their betting
clothes on.
The butchers' race drew a goodly num
ber of the knights of the blocfc and
cleaver, and they snapped up pools as
eagerly as an Indian does red lemonade
at a circus. The same old raw wind blew
in from the sea and considerable scoring
was necessary to properly warm the horses
up.
An unusual occurrence was the fact
that in all four of the events decided the
winning horse won in straight heats.
The big attraction of the day was the
match race between the two crack side
wheelers, W. Wood, 2:07, and Waldo J.,
2 08, the gray ghost from Santa Paula.
Everybody looked forward to a stubborn
contest and the outcome was a disappoint
ment. Iv the auction pooling Waldo J
sold for $'JO, with the bay gelding bringing
$14. Waldo drew the pole with his com
petitor further out in the cuppy going.
Tnis is not to the latter's liking, and the
gray ghos*. leading throughout, won the
heat as he pleased in 2:15.
The betting now lagged ; the favorite
bringing $20 against $5 lor the Oakwood
I'ark Stock Farm's representative. T..e
second and deciding heat was a repe
tition of the one preceding, Waldo jogging
under the wire eased up in 2:17^.
Helena, a handsome bay daughter of
the dead Electioneer, entered by Palo
Alto stock farm, was the first winner of
the day, placing the 2:19 irot to her credit
in straight beats. The betting on this
event was extremely lively, fn the first
pools sold the field wa^favorite at $10,
with Nutwood Wilkes bringing $8 and
Helena $7. They shiited before the Horses
were called out. Helena selling for $10,
Nutwood Wilkes $10 and the field $0. The
Wilkes horse drew the pole, but after
turning into the backstretch Helena out
trotted him and took the inside position.
Dustin rated bis mare nicely and passed
tne wire a lenztb to the good in 2:lBJ^.
with Wilkes a dozen lengths in advance of
Mamie Griffin.
For the second heat pools' sold: Helena
|20, Nutwood Wilkes $12 and the field $7.
Tins was a well contested heat, for after j
leading from the word "go" Nutwood i
Wilkes came witn a fine showing of speed, !
and the Palo Alto mare won oy but three
parts of a length in 2:18^. Helena now 1
sold for $20 against $6 lor the entire field.
When McNair sent tliem away for this
heat the favorite appeared a trifle uncer
taiu. and just after turning into the back- !
stretch went to a break. At the half
Wilkes was leading her by two lengths,
but at the three-furlong pole Dustin drove
his mare around the stallion and again
had the pole, turning into the stretch for i
home.
The previous hard heat had evidently i
told on the <^>lt, for Helena passed the i
judges eased up three lengths before :
bim in 2:lÃsÂ£ The second quarter of this I
heat was paced at a 2:09 gait, and this fact I
probably did not help the chances of the
son of Guy Wilkes.
The 2:3> pace, witn a field of four start
ers, was decided under the new innova
tion of making e/Uh heat a race. The
books held Gladva W a 4 to 5 chance for
the lir>t heat, ami the wise peopie after
ward wondered where the tip came from. |
She broke repeatedly and was distanced. \
Adele, the second choice at 3 to 2, captured :
the heat easily in 2:20^, after shaking j
Sindwood off a furlong from the wire. I
Adele was now a hot 3 to 5 chance for the j

next heat, ond, going without a skip,
passed the stand an easy winner in 2:25}Â£,
with Sindwood again finishing second.
The third npat also went to the daughter
of Dextrr Prince. Alto Geno, another
Dexter Prince horse, finished second in
this heat. "The driver of Sindwood took
matters just a trifle too easy and was
nipped out the last few yarJs by Gladys
W for third money.
The butchers' race demonstrated tho
fact that there are "good things" in all
lines of business. There were five entries,
and the betting was of the hottest sort.
Mr. Judge's horse Captain Harm sold fa
vorite at $30, with the field going like hot
cakes at $15 and Mr. Foss'Poio in strong
demand at $10. If the other gentlemen in
the race did not know that Mr. Judge
had something up his sleeve, they must
have been aware of it at the conclusion of
the first heat. Captain Harri-; did nothing
but make his field look like Government
mules, although in justice to Polo, who,
although outclassed, it must be said made
an excellent showing. The Captain plaped
the neat to his credit without a skip in
The markets were now very dull, there
apparently being a sort of "up against it"
feeling on the part of the partisans of
Polo and the field. When the five starters
for the second heat came out Mr. Schraaer
up behind General, a chestnut horse who
exhibited spesd in spots, appeared smok
ing a "Perfecto" of very rich color. Now,
this is one of the things Mr. McNair de
murs to and he informed Mr. Schrader
that the weed could be dispensed with.
The butch-r said, "Well, I guess I
will smoke it," but when the man from
Wichita informed him as he was driving
away that it would cost him $10 if he did,
there was a jerky movement to the sulky
and with a wistful, lingering look at the
wrapper JJlr. Scbrader and his "Perfecto"
ceased to be comrades. Tae heat was
then trotted and Captain Harris finished
first with Polo second again, Time, 2:37.

Vandals at Work.
On several occasions yesterday gangs of
young hoodlums, and some old ones of the
same breed, started out for fun, as they called
it.' Their sport consisted mainly in tearing
down the decorations along the streets. A
number of decorations on stores and houses
were ripped from the fastenings, and It was
very difficult for the police to catch any of the
vandals in their work. Howevr, a number
were caught in the act of tearing down the
lanterns put up by the Fourth 01" July decora
tion committee. They were charged with ma
licious mischief. The fellows gave the names
of Joseph Iffa, Gladstone Harris, Silvio Vig
nanego and M. Mitchell.

ALL PATRIOTIC
AND REPUBLICAN.
Brief History of the Great
Afro- American
League.
WORK OF FIVE YEARS.
Started in San Francisco With
Less Than One Hundred and
Fifty Members.
LEAGUES NOW IN EVERY CITY.
Membership Throughout the State
Now Numbers Something Over
S yen Thousand.
An enthusiastic meeting of the Afro-
Americans of this City who were mem
bers of the Republican party and advo
cates of its general policy, including the
belief that none but responsible and honest
men should be nominated and elected to
hold official positions, took place in Ger
mama (now California) Hail, 662 Biuh
street, Monday evening, August 10, 1891.
| After an interchange of the opinions of
j those present it was decided to form an
! association that would uunold the princi
ples of the Republican party and by this
action benefit their people in maintaining
tneir political rights. In addition they de
sired to assist, as far as they were able, in
the National, State and municipal elec
tions, so that the party of Fremont, Lin
coln, Sumner and other noble men might
win triumphs of a permanent and im
portant character. It was also understood
that as the plan of operation and member
ship of the league increased, strenuous ef
forts would be made to obtain employment
for those looking for work, and in this and
other ways establish a fraternity of inter
est an 1 good will toward eacii other.
Under most propitious circumstances
the Afro-American League of San Fran
cisco was organized with about 150 mem
bers. When the question was asked who
should be the leader of this new movement,
the respense came by the unanimous selec
tion of T. B. Morton. It was a wise choice.
Tiiis gentleman not only had the confi
dence of his brother members, but he pos
sessed administrative ability of a high
order, and was regarded as not only capa
ble but entirely trustworthy. An execu
tive committee was also selected and the
league started with bright hopes on a
career of great usefulness. It must be ad
mitted that there were some people who
; did not fully understand the objects in
view, who had doubts as to the success of
the enterprise and soon became prophets
of il! omen and who with much assurance
vigorously asserted that the league would
have a very short and by no means a
charmed life. It was believed that as soon
| aa the next election was held it would Dass
out of existence and never be heard of
again.
But these prophets were mistaken.
They forgot to take into account the zeal
and enthusiasm of President Morton. The
meetings of the league have increased in
interest and attendance. They are held
monthly, special meetings being called
when circumstances require.
The San Francisco League was the first
A fro- American league organized in tliis
State and has been followed by many or
ganizations of a similar character and
purpose throu hout California.
The league has frequently assisted in a
charitable way many worthy causes, irsti
j tutions and persons deserving of financial
aid, as well as indorsements and proper
recognition of those engaged in educa
tional and reformatory movements.
Among such instances it is fitting to refer
to the visit of Miss Hattie Q. Brown to the
Pacific Coast on behalf of the Tuskegee
Institute, Booker T. Washington founder
and president, located in Alabama, and
under the management of a board of con
trol composed of members of their race.
Soon after her arrival in San Francisco the
league tendered her a grand testimonial.
Tne handsome sum of $103 was realized,
$/8 of which was handed to Miss Brown
for the benefit of the institute, and the
balance, $25. was donated and sent to Miss
Gordon, a colored lady in charge of the
five schools of the Congo Free State.
In 1893 Miss Valletta Winalow expressed
a desire to visit the Eastern section of the
Union for the purpose of completing her
studies. This larly always gave her ser
vice yoiuntarially when called upon to as
sist in racial enterprises. Remembering
these courteous acts. Mr. Morton and the
members of the league, desirous of mani
festing their respect for the youne lady,
arranged a benefit, and placed in her
hand-Â« $45 as a result of their efforts.
When in the fall of 1893 the news was re
ceived of the cruel and wanton lynching
of Blunt and Milier iv the South by a law
less mob, tDe league called a mass-meet
ing to denounce the outrage and to de
mand proper redress for the perpetration
of so great a crime. The gathering was a
lar<rc one, and very determined in tone
and character.
It <iid not forget the surviving widows
of the murdered men, but raised $25 for
each of them to assist iv defraying the ex
penses of a suit for damages in the States
where the outrages occurred.
On this occasion Colonel John o' Byrne
dplivred the principal address, and Hon.
Max Popper raised tbecollection. Through
the encouragement ana efforts of the
league Miss Ida B. Wells, the famous and
world-renowned lecturer and opponent of
lynching, delivered several stirring and
eloquent addresses here, as well as in the
principal cities of California, and also in
Denver, Col.o
"The Afro-American League," said W.
E. Henderson, State lecturer, yesterday,
"is Republican in poli'ics, but "under all
circumstances reserves the right to be tbe
sole judge of what constitutes a Republi
can.
"They hare always taken an active part
in politics, believing it the duty of every
true American citizen to keep corrupt
men out of office and only true, honest,
loyal Americans to be entrusted with the
affairs of the State and Nation. We be
lieve the highest duty a man owes to him
self is the love of a home, and in order to
have a home and have it properly pro
tected he must be interested in the politi
cal affairs of the State and Nation.
"Hence, we have always felt it a para
mount duty to defeat any candidate for
office that does not come up to our stand
ard of Republicanism."
There will be a second Animal Congress
i of the Afro- Americans of California held
I in the city of Los Angelas August 10.
They expect, with a satisfactory railroad
rate, an outpouring of their people such
as has never been seen in this State.
Tbe officers of the league are: T. B.
Morton, president; Abraham Strather,
secretary; Ezekiel Cooper, treasurer. Ex
ecutive committeeâ W. W. Butler, chair
man; Oliver Patelow, E. T. Huhbard, An
drew Gant, R. H. Clifford. John Q. Barton,
George W. Brown, secretary. W. E. Hen
derson, State lecturer. State organizers â
Rev. Tilghman Brown, San Francisco;
Key. W. A. JJrinfcJey, Stockton; Rev. Rob
en Birdwell. Paso Robles; Hon. John Pe
ters, La tj range; Rev. George E. Duncan,
association chaplain.
The colored people of California look
forward to the assembling of this congress
as the great event of the year, as they have
twenty-seven leagues throughout the
State, with a membership of nearly 7000.
VIEWS OF MORTON.
Makes a Special Plea to the Repub
lican Party for Recognition of
His People.
One of the leading men of the colored
people of the State is T. B. Morton, who
las been a resident of San Francisco for
many years. He is the president of the
State organization of the Afro-American
eagues, as well as president of the City
league. The prominence and influence he
las obtained among the members of hi 3
ace springs from a desire to benefit his
people.
In August next, at Los Angeles, will be
leld the second annual congress of the
A.fro- American leagues. Alatters of great
mportance will be presented for intelli
gent consideration by the delegates, who
:ome from ali parts of California to repre
sent their respective leagues or clubs.
"It is most difficult," said President
Morton yesterday, "for a colored man to
obtain employment in the general avoca
tions of life on account of the senseless
irejudice that exists against the black
nan. He is not allowed a fair chance in
ac race of life, not even in the industries
hat are protected in part by his vote,
nany obstacles being placed in his way
when attempting to earn a livelihood. On
this account the congress will, no doubt,
levote much attention as to the means to
>c employed and encouragement given to
better our present unfortunate condition.
"It will undoubtedly advise the race
generally to contribute by their labor
more to the markets of their immediate
ocalities, but also of the entire Stateâ in
tine to become more and more producers,
and in this way be independent and more
self-reliant citizens. For instance to make
combinations so that business enterprises
can be engaged in on a moderate scale; to
acquire the knack of manufacturing many
saleable articles; to encage in more indus
tries and callings than" at present, such as
mining, farming, gardening, raising vari
ous kinds of produce, vegetables, fruits
and flowers.
"The young people of the race will be
encouraged by the coneress to cultivate
their talents so that they will be fitted lor
the various callings in the business world,
and not De contented to live from hand, to
mouth. We need to show our ability, and
we have considerable, and thus receive
that recognition we deserve, and disarm
many good men and women who wish as
prosperity of any lurking prejudice that
remains. The sight of a colored man suc
cessfully managing a little farm, keeping
a booK or grocery store, or as Booker T.
Wasnington says: 'The sight of. a colored
man owning and operating a brickyard
that turns out 50.000 bricks per day is
worth more in convincing the world of our
worth than weeks, and even months, of
ab.- tract argument.'
"It may be of interest to state that the
membership of the league has increased
from 3000 last year to something over
6000 at the present time, so that it is ex
pected that this large number wiKJ>e well
represented at the coming congress, show
ing a concerted movement in tne enlarge
ment and work of our racial organizations..
Indeed, there is an increasing desire to
pool our differences and co-operate for our
advantage individually and collectively.
"Now as to what action the con
gress will take with regard to the
political parties and political issues, it
is hard for me to outline the course that
will be pursued. It is well known that
our people generally vote the Republican
ticket, and of rignt should do so. But
for several years past there lias been stead
ily growing dissatisfaction all over tne
country with the treatment that has been
accorded by the party tnat claims to b.*
the exponent of equality before the law,
of equal rights and equal common privi
leges in a legal sense and from a political
point of view. Thecau^efor tuis discon
tent is that some of the lead, rs, and even
many of the rank and file, unmistakably
and most plainly show that they care
nothing more than to secure the colored
man's vote at the polls, and then they turn
their backs upon dim until another cam
paign comes round.
"What we want and wnat we shall fight
for is to have our rights considered by the
Republican party. I do not mean in
promises â we have had enough of that
cin<: oi talk â but something substantial â
something which will show that our loy
ilty to ihe party is appreciated. Tne
Democratic party is the natural enemy of
the 'clack man,' and our only hope lies
with the success of the Republican party.
1 Not long ago one of the party leaders
from tne Southern portion of the State,
whi;e in tuis City on business connected
with the Republican party, was spoken to
is to the advisability of "placing one col
ored man from the South and one from t,:e
North on the State Central Committee at
arge as the colored vote had increased ma
terially and it would be well for the party
to pay a little more attention to this ele
nent, especially since all the side-show
parties were drawing heavily Irom the Re
publican party.
"The attention of the gentleman was
sailed to the fact that the Democrats had
placed a colored man on tueir State com
mittee, and that he was aiso a member of
the executive committee. To this, he said :
â¢That's nothing. What's the use to be
worrying about !ish we have cot skinned
and ready to :"ry? All you need to do
when the time comes is just to give him a
good, grand old whqop-up time, and men
tion the name of Lincoln, and you can't
drive them from us. We have been frying
them for years, and with the names of
Lincoln, Sumner, Grant and a few otners,
we can do it for years to comeâ just let
them alone; don't bother yourself about
them, and everything is all right.'
"Now this is pretty good evidence of
the loyalty of the negroes to the Republi
can party and I am truly proud of it, but
I cannot say that I like to have a Repub
lican speak of our martyred presidents,
Lincoln and Garfieid; nor of Sunnier,
Grant and other great statesmen, as noth
ing more than old nsh grease to fry salt
herrings with; but tie evidently meant no
reflection on the noble records of these
truly distinguished men, but simply that
he and all these latter day saints ot Repub
licanism could and would continue to ride
on the backs and votes of the black man
into official station, upon the brilliant
Republican record of these illustrious
men named.
"If it is a duty, and it certainly is, for
all of us as a rule to vote for the white
Republican candidates all the time, it cer
tair.ly would be a grateful as well as a
graceful actâ indeed an act of simple jus
tice â for the Republican party as a whole
to vote for men of our race some of the
time, if nothing more. But I am firmly
convinced that all of these petty wrongs
and personal slights can be, and I trust
will be, remedied by a concerted action
among the broad, liberal minded and right
thinking men within the Republican party
itself, and I trust in no other way. At the
same time I am aware that no preat prin
ciple or question is ever permanently set
tled until it h settled right. I have been,
and ever since President Harrison's last
letter accepting tbe nomination from the
Minneapolis convention in which, being
scared to death by the New York Sun and
the howling Democrats in the House, he
flew the track, on this question, satisfied
that the question of human rights,
upon which all other rights depend
in organized Governments, would not oc
ctipy much space in positive form in the
platform of the party again, especially so
far as it relates to 'the black race in the
United States, until we ourselves, sup
ported as we will be by that, large follow
ing of old-fashioned Republicans who are
watching the course of the party and see
how it is drifting by degrees from its orig- |
inal and fixed principles based upon the j

present this issue again before the Repub

way this can be effectively done is by a \
thorough organization of our people in j
every State where our vote is not only an '
important factor, but absolutely necessary
to the success of the party, and then form i
a union of all these State organizations.
This would concentrate the vole of
ihe Afro-American citizens for a common
purpose throughout the country. In this
connection I can say that this work, while
it is uphill, it is true, is progressing most
satisfactorily. We must make our strength
felt in the county and State first, espe
cially in the Congressional elections and
for the right kind of men; for, say what
you will, all the wronesand injustice done

The disease known as varicocele has baffled the medical profession at every tarn.
The various attempts to remove it have all proven ineffective, and some of them even
more injurious than the disease itself. The knife, vacuum, compression and massage
have all been tried and all failed, and yet Varicocele and its large following of wastine
weaknesses can be cured. Varicocele is a congestion of the stagnant blood in the
veins, with considerable distention of the glands. Electricity will decompose this
congested state and drive the stagnant blood into the circulation, relieving the vein.

Oakland has never been quieter on a Na
tional holiday than it was to-day. Even
when the forest primeval stood where tbe
electric tracks now traverse Broadway
there was as much sign of life as to-day.
The city took a holiuay, but it took it
out of town. There was not a vestige of
anything approaching a celebration, no
attempt at decoration and not a surplus of
firecrackers. A few small boys met with
accidents and Dr. Akerly attended to two
rather serious cases, but no severe acci
dents were, reported.
There were a few small fires, but the
damage was very slight. What might
have developed into a big blaze called the
department to Sixth avenue and East
Eleventh street. A block of old barns and
houses is located there and surrounding
everything is dry crass several feet nish.
Firecrackers set the brush on fire in sev
eral places, and for a time the houses were
threatened, but by fighting the flames
from several points serious damage was
prevented.
There was much growling in the drunk
department of the City Hall. Under ordi
nary conditions last night's crop would
have been released to-morrow, but as Sun
day follows the Fourth there is no relief
for the unfortunates till Monday morning.
Some of the celebrants were so mudaied
this morning that Jaijer Barnett lost bis
patience explaining to his guests how it
all happened.
The Salvation Army held a reunion of
the bay cities and towns at Beulah Park, ft
was larceiy attended and officers and sol
diers eathered from all Darts. Adjutant
Egner, who left Oakland two years ago
to go and establish the work in Honolulu,
waÂ« present and gave a very gratifying ac
count of the work in the islands, where
several flourishing stations are now
founded.
At Leona Heights there was an old
fashioned Fourth of July time and a
patriotic programme "was carried out un

was president of the day.
Haywards had festivities at the park

The directors of the Oakland exposition
met last night and received the partial re
port of the programme committee. It is
as follows:
The programme committee would suggest
the appointment of Alex Stewart as musical di
rector of the exposition, he to organize a band
to be known as the Oakland Exposition band
same to furnish music afternoons and even,
ings when required. â¢
The opening night it is hoped that we may
have speeches by Governor Budd, Senator Per
kins, Irvinjt M. Scoit and Horace Davis. The
committee recommend that there be no speak
ing- at the evening entertainments, except at
the opening Digbt.
We are arranging to have certain dayg dedi
cated to the following cities and towns: Ala
xneda, Berkeley, San Leandro, Uaywards,
Is'iles. Pleasanton and Livermore, and it is
hoped that the railroads will make special con
cession * on these days.
One entire Saturday we hope to give up to
the children of the public schools, the after
noon for those of the first grade and lower and
the evening to those of the grammar and high
schools.
B. McFadden, D. Edward Collins, Thoa Gier
and A. E. Nysinger, representing the follow
ing societies of Alameda County: Irish,
Scotch , German and African, are each arrang
ing an evening programme. There will be
musical and literary exercises, together with
characters of the different countries.
A competitive drill Jor prizes by the Boys'
Brigade of Alameda County is thought of ior
oDe evening.
The Native Sops, Acme and Reliance Ath
letic clubs and ihe G. A. R. will be asked to
furnish an evening's entertainment.
For the afternoons the following are under
consideration: Kindergarten exercises, baby
show, lady writers, universal buffrage, enter
tainment for children.
Arrangements were made to erect a
Mammoth tent, and the flooring will be
commenced in a few days. The committee
also recommended that the stage be en
larged so as to extend across the entire
eastern wail of the tabernacle, and that a
sounding board be added. Both sugges
tions will be carried out.

THE FRUIT CROP.
Pears Suffering From Slug! at San
Lorenzo â Good Prices Obtained
Jn the K:iit-
OAKLAND, Cal., July 4.-The follow
ing statements regarding the fruit crop
and prospects were compiled by the Hay
wards Journal:
In the East last Wednesday Alameia and
Santa Clara- cherries sold for 20 cents a pound.
The pear slug is doing considerable damage
in many San Lorenzo orchiirds. A solution of
parts green is recommended â one pound to
200 gallons of water. wit*i a mixture of soap.
Messrs. I. H. hegier, J. Gawne and other
growers ot San Leandro have deÂ«id< d to ship
their "apricots tr> the Eastern markets thu
year. The San Francisco canners have com
bined, with the result that it does not pay to
ship to that market.
The attitude o$ the canneries In refusing to
set a price on apricots is bi-iiiÃ closely watched
by the orchardists, and many are well pre
pared to dry the fruit rather than sell it ior a
cheap figure, says the Haywards Review.
A. H. Hall Is a"Livennore VÂ»lley farmer. For
a year or two nast the June tmes have played
havoc with Ms apricot crop. This year he
started In to Us ht ttie bugs with smudge fires.
For weeks past fee has kept his apricot trees
saturated with Bi'>oke, and as a consequence
has a nice clean crop of cots. He says when
the smoke {joes into the trees tne June bugs go
up In swarms, like geese at the crack of a
shotgun.
The Georgia peach crop, which is considered
quite a factor in competition with California
fruit, is reported to be only one-third to half a
crop, a* compared with last season, and there
is liable to be still further damage to tne
Georgia crop on account of rains early in
July.

Wounded.
Boys Supposed to Have Taken
Advantage of a Patriotic
Ordinance.
Oakland Office San Fhancisoo Call,>
908 Broadway, July 4. j
Miss Clara Ellis of Bray avenue, Fruit
vale, was shot and seriously wounded to
night on: Webster street. The shooting
was evidently done by some one who was
firing bullets instead of the blank car â¢
t ridges allowed by the city ordinance to be
discharged on the 3d, 4th and sth of July.
Miss Ellis was walking along Webster
street, and when near Eleventh street she
was struck in the cheek by a bullet which
fortunately had spent most of its force.
The missile plowed through the lady's
cheek and lodged in the back of the neck.
The injured woman was taken to a
drugstore and Dr. Johnson probed for the
bullet. As it was not in a dangerous posi
tion he succeeded in extracting it. Miss
Ellis was sent home after the operation
and will, it is expected, recover in a few
weeks.
Several reports were made to-night that
young men were taking advantage of the
blank cartridge ordinance and were firing
bullets. The mishap that befell Miss
E.Â»i9 will probably result in an amend
ment to the ordinance. Miss Ellis did not
see any one who she thinks may have
tired the shot.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1896.
PUT DENIED TO
VETERAN SOLDIERS
They Wanted to Establish
a Place at Lone Tree
Cemetery.
NO REASON WAS GIVEN.
Land Was Bought With Money
Issued ior the Home
Guard.
NEVER SAW ACTIVE SERVICE.
Now the Veterans C nsider That
They Are Entitled to a Small
Section.
Oakland Office San Fbancisto Call,}
908 Broadway, July 4. )
Tbe old soldiers of Hav wards are de
spondent. They are without a special
veterans' plat in any cemetery and they
feel that they should be accorded tbe
privilege.
For a long time the veterans in that
neighborhood, have been trying to procure
a plat of their own, but so far they have
not been succersful. Beveral weeks ago
they held a meeting to discuss t c matter,
and as a result a communication was sent
to the trustees of Lone Mountain Cemetery
asking that enough land be donated to
provide for the veterans, of whom there
are not a great number. They agreed to
keep the plat in order and to make it one
of the most beautiful spots in the ceme
tery.
They waited a long time for a reply and
when it finally came it was not the kind
of answer that they had expected. It
merely stated that tbe trustees were "un
able to comply with your request." The
reply was very short, and its shortness
has had the same effect on the old soldiersf
as stroking tbe tiair the wrong way has on
a cat.
The veterans feel that they were at least
entitled to a reason for the refusal to com
ply with their request, and they feel sore
toward Trustees Rice, Dole, Linnaker ana
Luce because no explanation was given.
"There is much ground on which to base â 
our request," said one of the veterans to- j
day. "We would not have asked for a
pint if we di i not think we were leinti- ,
mately entitled to it In tbe first place,
our request was a very respectful one. We
offered to take good care of the plat, to <
plant flowers and keep them cultivated,
Mid to see that the graves were neat and !
frequently decorated. We also wished to
erect a flagstaff, so that on all public occa
sions Old Glory could float over the graves
of those who loved her more than them
selves. We would also have tried to pro
cure some permanent decorations in the
way of old pieces of ordnance from the
Army and Navy Department, and alto
gether we would have made the plat a j
place of beauty and suggestively histor- j
ical.
"At the time of the war what was known
as tbe Home Guard was organized at Hay
wards. It was carried on as a body of mili
tiamen, but they were never called upon.
Indeed, the idea was that they were sim
ply organized for action in case actual hos
tilities should reach the coast. Money
was raised for that part of the guard, but
as it was never pressed into service the
fund was not used.
" Vfter some time had elapsed the money
was invested in a cemetery, and each mem
ber of the Home Guard obtained title to a
lot for about $10. The whole cemetery
was bought for a * mall sum, and we think
we are entitled to a piece oi it. The ama
teur soldiers will be buried in it, but the
veterans who saw active service are denied
the privilege of being buried in a 'soldier's
plat' "
ft QUIET CELEBRATION,
The Day Closely Observed as a
Holiday by All Classes of
the Community.
Meeting of the People's Party and
of the Board of
H a.ih
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 4.â The National
anniversary was celebrated here to-day by
the display of bunting and flags on the
public buildings and the closing of all the
business places on the streets. It is not
known when the day was so closely ob
served bnfore.
The trains and electric cars carried
three-fourths of the residents out of the
city, and left the stay-at-home boy and the
firemen to hold high carnival with them
selves and bundes of firecrackers.
No fires have occurred, and the only ac
cident reported is that of a member of the
fourth estate, whose white waistcoat and
shirt bosom were demolished by the burst
ing of a big redjack firecracker.
Health Measures.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 4.â The regular
meeting of the Board of Health was held
laxt'nigbt.
The Health Officer's report bhowed 28
births and 13 deaths for the month of
June. Tne contagious diseases reported
were: Scarlet fever 1, measles 2, tuber
culosis 1 and chicken-pox 5.
The Sanitary Inspector reported that he
had inspected fifteen new buildings and
collected $59 in fees.
Dr. Lubbock made reference to the
canned cream and bottled milk of a cer
tain creamery. To feed any infant with
the stuff would in his opinion be next
door-neighbor to murder. Several samples
were inspected at the meeting and all
found to be in a high state of putrefaction.
The permit to sell their goods in this city
was revoked by a unanimous vote.
The People's Party.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 4.â An impor
tant meeting of the People's party was
held tbis evening in the lower ball of
Linderman Opera-house. Matters in con
nection with the Presidential campaign
were discussed, and >t was resolved "That
it is ior the be.-t interests of the people
that a man De nominated by the People's
party for President of the United States
who is in sympathy with the principles of
the Omaha platform."
John Drew Next Weelr.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 4.â The interest
manifested in the engagement of John
Drew at the Macdonough for three nights
beginning Tuesday night next indicates
that it will be brilliant in its results from
all standpoints. Of its artistic success we
have not the slightest doubt, for Mr.
Drew's conscientious and finished work is
already well known to Oakland playgoers.
The opening bill will be Madeleine Lu
cette Kyley's picturesque love story,
"Christopher Jr.," which Mr. Drew pre
sented for fifteen weeks at Charles Froh
man's Empire Theatre. Wednesday and
Thursday nights K. C. Carton's comedy of
men, manners and woman's foible 3, "The
Â£q-.iire of Dames," wiii be given. ThiS
latter comedy has so far been the crown
ing event of Mr. Drew's stellar career, and
he presented it with what rnpy be de
scribed as tremendous success for the last
three weeks of his thirty weeks' season
in New Yoric Miss Maud Adams,, of
course, has the leading feminine roles in
both nlays and every other member of
this perfect company is admirably cast.
Mr, D-ew's engagement formally opens
the Macdonougb under its new lessees and
manager?, Messrs. Friedlander. Gottlob
& Co., and in their honor sevoral th-ater
parties will cross the bay from ban Fran
cisco. The bouse will be beautifully deoo
rated.
LOST HI THUMB.
Frank O'Neal Sorry That He Handled
a Brake-Rod.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 4. â Frank
O'Neal's curiosity cost him a thumb
to-day. Frank was with several other
lads who were inspecting one of the new
cars of the Laundry Farm Electric Rail
road. The boys were handling tbe brake
baams and O'Neal had hold of one when
the motorman let go the brake, not know
ing that the boys were handling it.
Frank's thumb was twiste.i instantly
around the cylinder and was flattened out
tot c second joint. It required half an
hour to release the lad's finder. Detective
Holland drove him to the Receiving Hos
pital, where the curtailed member was
dressed.

of the time and frequently the number of
alarms reacUed nearly a hundred. Last year
but fourteen alarms were sounded, but
this Fourth all previous records were
broken, particularly as two of the alarms
were false.
The loss and damage this year was much
smaller than heretofore. As might be ex- !
pected nearly all of yesterday's fires were j
started by tue burning refuse of fireworks
tailing between bmldincs and into r>iles of !
rubbish. With one exception, a fire in a
dry goods store on Stocicton street, the
Fire Department was not called upon to
do very hard work.
At an early hour yesterday morning an !
alarm was sounded for a fire in H. Somers' i
barber-shop at 414 Montgomery avenue.
The fire was caused by some one carelessly
throwing a ligtiled cigar-stump into a pile
of paper The damace was $70.
Shortly before 10 o'clock a. m. an alarm
was sounded from box 217 for a fire In Mrs. ;
D. Sie^senccr's dry-KOods store at 1813 !
Devisadero street, li was caused by a
small boy throwing a big firecracker
among the dry gools. The builaine. which
j is owned by H. W. Miller, was damaged
I about $25, and the dry goods were damaged
about $100.
It was not until 6 o'clock that the alarms
began to come in. and for a time the fire
men were Kept busy. From that time on
the alarms were as follows:
6p. m., box 234. 128 and 130 Twenty
ninth street, a two-story frame house
owned by Mrs. Anna Gabriel and occupied
as a dwelling by Ms. Gabriel, William
Toohy and James Reeder. Tbe fire was
started by a lot of refuse by tbe side of
tie building being ignited by firecrackers.
Loss, $150.
6:30 p. m., box 183. The fire was at 8
Eighth street, in a building owned by
Thomas Malloy and occupied by J. Bretto
as a beltstore. Fireworks falling between
the walls started the blaze, which resulted
in a los 3of about $250.
8:08 p. m., box 362. Firecrackers started
a small blaze in the residence of John
Cavauaugh, at 814 Fifteenth street, caus
ing damage to ttie amount of $5.
8:57 p. m., box 192. False alarm turned
in on account of a pile of rubbbh burning
in a vacant lot.
9p. m., box 205. A three-story frame
building at 1304 Stockton street, owned by
the Willey estate. The fire broke out on
the ground floor, which was used as a dry
and fancy goods store by George Wood.
It is supposed that some malicious or care
less person burleii a larL'e firecracker
throngh one of the windows, which sst
fire to the stock. By the time the firemen
reached the place the premises were in a
btnze from the floor to the ceiling and it
was necessary to turn on a full head of
water, regardless of tbe stock.
For a time it looked as though the fire
would cut its way into the upper part of the
building and worK out to the adjoining
building, but after fifteen minutes' sharp
fighting the firemen conquered. Mr. Wood
lost his entire stock, and the total loss
and damage will reach $2000. Mr. Wood
stated that his store had beeu closed since
noon, and a big hole in one of the front
windows led tothÂ« belief that a large fire
cracuer was the cause of the blaze.
At 10:10 p. M. box 254 was a false alarm.
10:45 p. m., box 271, John Indenh's dwell
ing at 386 Dolores street. Damage, $5;
cause, firecrackers.
10:50 p M.. box 286, false alarm.
10:45 P. M., box 62â Skyrockets falling
through the glass skylights of Mrs. Bank
er's photograph parlors at 839 Mission
street, set fire to the upper story of the
building, which is a three-story frame
structure.
By the time the blaze was extinguished
the building and contents were damaged
to about $500. Oscar Foss owns the build
ing. _
A WESTERN CRAZE.
Condition* in Finance That Have Much
Influence on Agriculturists.
â¢â¢I have lately traveled through the
great corn-producing sections of the United
States, 11 said J. H. Phelps of New York, at
the Riggs. "Everywhere I went the gran
aries were filled to bursting witii corn.
From Dcs Moines to Sioux City there are
millions of bushels stored away. It isn't
worth anything scarcely, and the same
may be said of oats, potatoes, and all the
other products of that rich agricultural
region. There is no local demand, and
the transportation charges to distant mar
kets leave no profit to the producer.
"It is not to be wondered at in the face
of such conditions (which also exist in
Illinoia, Nebraska and South Dakota), that
the agricultural people are in favor of free
silver. They are disgusted with the pres
ent status, and are willing to risk the
silver cure. Out in the country if you
buy a cigar or drink and put down a $5
bill, you will invariably get back four
silver dollars and the remainder in silver
of smaller value. Gold is unknown and
paper money is rare. Eastern people who
never get away from home seem surprised
at the strength of the silver cause, but if
they would take a trio as far west as
Omaha they would understand the reasons
that are behind the movement."âWash

UNDER THE TREES
AT EL CAMPO.
Hibernians Cross the Bay
for a Patriotic
Outing.
A GREAT CELEBRATION.
The Nation's Holiday Fittingly
Observed With Song and
Ceremony.
IMPRESSIVE CLOSING CHORUS.
James H Barry's Stirring Oration.
What G<nrs Were Played
and Priz?s Won.
The one hundred and twentieth anni
versary of American Independence will
long be remembered as a red-letter day in
the history of the Ancient order of Hiber
nians of America in this City and sur
rounding localities.
For many weeks preceding the "Glorious
Fourtu" the chiefs of the Order had la
bored zealously for the success of the
grand picnic which was held yesterday at
El Campo, and that their aims were ac
complished was amply proven by the im
mense concourse of people who partici
pated in this out-of-town celebration.
The festivities on the grounds com
menced upon t.e arrival of the first boat
from San Francisco at 10 a. m and were
continued without intermission until 6
p. M., when, upon a signal from Rev.
Father Crowley, State Chaplain of the A.
O. H. of A., the perspiring musicians hur
ried through the closing numbers of an
"Irish quadrille,'" and by a single bugle
blast announced to the multitude that the
hour for retiring had arrived.
The scene at the moment reflected credit
uuon the great fraternal society under
whose auspices the fete had been
arranged.
Over six thousand happy people re
sponded to ihe strains of "Home, Sweet
Home" and as they filed along the broad
| pathway leading from the pleasure
j grounds to the wharf it was frequently
| remarked that no more orderly, well-be
j hayed assemblage had ever appeared at
i El Campo.
The-programme of exercises included an
oration by James H. Barry, reading of the
; Declaration of Independence by Peter J.
I McCormoekand "The Star-spangled Ban
; ncr" by Miss Kathcrine Black, in costume
i and accompanied by the orchestra; a prize
race for eiris under 12 years of ag^,
won by Katie O'Connell of Tiburon;
Drize races for boys under 16 years or
age, won by Joe Sullivan, 617 Natoma
street, and Ennis Roche, 825^' Folsoni ;
I prize races for married ladies, wmi by Mr.-:,
I Gilroy, 124J4 Noe Btreet, and Mrs. Kelly.
'48 Chepultepec street; prize races f^r
; married men, won by Fred Palmer, of J. J.
O'Brien & Co., and Frank Sullivan, 637
j Natoma street ; Drize races for fat ladies,
won by Mrs. Kate Egan, 651 Myrtle ave
nue, and Mrs. Hurley, 31 Gilbert street;
prize races for fat men, won by H. Bozner
and M. J. Kelly, 303}Â£ Dolores street.
The tug-of-war was won by the team
representing divisions 2 and 9, and com
posed of the following: John Kehoe
I (anchorman), P. Cassidy, P. Sloan, P. Mc
carty, Jnck Carroll, Con Sweeney, J.
Rickey, P. McNally, T. Davis.
The,losing team, from divisions 3 and
i 10, was as follows: Daniel Sheehan
(anchorman), M. Smith, Thomas Healy,
P. M. Nevin. P. F. Donohue, Philip
O'Donnell, Thomas Stack, Luke Dempsey,
I J. McConville, P. Smith.
Fred Palmer, the noted athlete, evoked
much praise for the strength and dexterity
he displayed in the several athletic con
tests in wt.ich he took part. J. O'Dowd
also received many flattering opinions for
I his pi-oticiency in the Celtic games.
The deepest interest was manifested in
the Irish jig and reel dancing which took
place on a specially prepared platform in
the shade of spreading trees some distance
from the main pavilion.
The unique natural combination of black
hair, bine eyes and rosy cheeks, at once
denoting and characterizing the pure Irish
Celt, was quite numerously represented in
the types of healthy womanhood who, re
called by their graceful step, dancing the
scenes of "Shaughraun," the "Peep O'Day
Boys," the "Colleen Bawn. 1 ' and ttie other
plays of the late Dion Boucicault.
The oration by Mr. Barry was the chiaf
event of the occasion and round after
round of applause from the vast audience
! greeted the speaker.
In the course of his address Mr. Barry
i dwelt upon the character of t- c celebra
tion, the patriotic memories it recalled
ami the obligation resting upon every
true American citizen of celebrating it
worthily.
He vigorously denounced those who
have introduced religious dissension into
the political and social life of the country*
and predicted that the day was near at
hand when they would receive the unani
mous condemnation of all patriotic, lii>
ertv-loving citizens.
He paid a clowing tribute to the ladies
of Martha Washington Circle of the La
dies' Hioernian Society, presided over by
Mrs. Jerome Deasy. He denounced the
monoDoly in the holding of land, which
has resulted in the impoverishment of
millions and the creation of an army
of tramys.
He vigorously denounced the bond sales
of th*> administration at Washington, and
as a remedy for all these evils proposed
the preferential system of voting, whereby
the people would have full representation
in ihe affairs of Government.

WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM.
Fund* for Buying Wheel* Are Diverted
From Other Linen of Trade.
Allowing that the wheels cost on an av
erage $50, which is a low estimate, it will
be seen that the aggregate expenditure in
volved ia considerable, particularly as a
wheel is hardly good for more than two
seasons. Tnere is no reliable data for es
timating the number of wheels produced
and sold annually, but the statement is
currently accepted that in 1894 half a mil
lion wheels were sold, while 1895 saw half
as many acain absorbed, and the prophets
cay the demand wiil call for a million
w heals this year.
If the money going into wheels came
from savings bunks or o'her deDOsitories
the effect would not be marked", but this
does not appear to be the fact. The funds
which e> t<> the bicycle are practically
those diverted from "other lines ol trade
where they have formerly been expended.
There is another side to the s ory, how
ever, which leads us to think that the
complaints of some tradts regarding the
bicycles may be exaggerated. As in the
economy of nature nothing i 3 wasted
so it is that the money devoted
to bicycles rinds its way eventually
into the regular channels of trade. It
is probably a blessing in disguise that the
bicycle business has developed such activ
ity in the dull times. Whan one considers
the number of people who are directly em
ployed or interested in the business it is
evident that the money coming to them ia
not displaced.
Leather, rubber and metal industries are
benefited Jaryrely and directly by the con
struction of the wheels, while supplying the
riders with specialties in shoes, sweaters,
stockings, leggings, caps, etc., keeps many
factories busy. Real-estate owners profit
from the rent of stores; the repairs to bicy
cles aivp occupation to many hundred men ;
the profits of the makers and handlers are
large. â Boston Commeicial Bulletin.

DOCTOR SWEANY
The Old Doctor, the Skilled Surgeon,
The Conqueror of All Chronic, Nervous and Special Diseases.
The Greatest Boon on Earth to Man
and Woman is Health.
The Glory of Man is His The Ambition of Woman
Strength. is Her Beauty.
Both Conditions Can Be Acquired.
The same foundation must be laid to build upon to reach the two conditions, viz.:
Strength and Beauty; and that foundation is health; with health the mind teems
with vivacity and freshness, the body is active and strong, and both the physical and
mental being are alive to and in touch with everything: which makes life bright, â  joy-
ous and happy.
Alarming Facts.
It is an alarming fact that three-fourths
of the men are lost to all the attributes
which make the strong, brave ai.d noble
man. They are prematurely old and dis-
eased throueh excesses or unnatural
Btrains which sap the fountains of life, de-
stroy the health and strength, and finally
result in physical wreck. These poor vic-
tims, loaded with disease, remorse and
humiliation, silently suffer on, going from
bad to worae, until death closes the sad
scene. Muscular strength and manly
power are both based upon the one condi-
tion, and that condition is health. With
health all the essential organs of the body
are capable of performing their functions
properly, producing mental brightness,
manly vigor and muscular power. Disease
robs the blood of its richness, tears down
tbe constitution ana destroys the mental
as well as the physical man.
Knt the Noble Work of Doctor Sweany, the World's Greatest Specialist,
Has convinced the greater part of the people of the civilized world that nine-tentht
of the chronic or lingering diseases of both men and women can be thoroughly and per-

Pope, forbids women to i take part either
as soloists or chorists in Roman Catholic
church services, an exception being, how
ever, made in favor of ' convent chapels.
The rule, of course, has lorfg been in force
in English cathedrals, and so strictly is it
carried out . at St. Paul's that when, as
in the St. David's. Day.' Welsh services, Â»
mixed chorus is employed, the ladies are
: seated outside the cuoir rails, where by a
pious fiction they are supposed to be mem
bers of the congregation. At Westminster
Abbey and elsewhere at musical festivals
mixed choirs are, however, permitted; the.
nonconformist choirs, as has amply been
proved: at their Crystal Palace festivals,
have many excellent female voices; the
Jews at the Berkeley-street Synagogue
have a choir of ladies and gentlemen;
while in the Roman Catholic services
Mmc- Patti (who in tier early days at Co
vent Garden frequently sang at the church
in SardJana street (Lincoln's-inn-neids),
Mme. Albani, Mroe. Calve and others
have often taken part. Indeed it is said
that the recent activity of the Congrega
tion of Rites' in reviving a law long dor
mant is due to the employment of opera
singers in the most solemn parts of the
mass in France. Henceforward, it is as
sumed, the female voices will be replaced
by boys, although down, at any rate, to
the accession of the present Pope, the
singers in the famous- Sistine Choir at
Rome were all adults, the aged Signor
Mustafa and his colleague Signor More

old, still, it is said, retaining their soprano

women of this vast couutry are suffering
from some chronic ailment, and in moat
cases that ailment is peculiar to her sex.
With that fortitude which only the true
woman possesses, she uncomplainingly
suffers on day after day, yes, year after
year, with the false hope that nature will
some time remedy her trouble and restore
her health. With the great love for beauty
which every woman desires, she, with
paints, powders and lotions, tries in vuin
to cover tip the lines and defects which the
cruel work of disease has wrought in her
once beautiful face. There is but one foun-
dation for beauty, and that is health.
Health produces a mind teeming with wit,
tbe bright, sparkling eye, the rosy cheek
and the plump and well-rounded form.

CHILD CRUSHED
UNDER A CAR,
Little Walton Manning
Meets With a Terrible
Death.
HIS MOTHER WATCHING.
She Saw Her Boy Smile and
Then Disappear Beneath the
Grinding Wheels.
WAS THEBE A WABNING BELL?
Ihe Motorman's Explanationâ A Mis
sion Tragedy That Darkened a
Holiday Celebration.
Walton Manning. 8 years of age, son of
James W. Manning, an employe of the
Market-street Railway Company, who re
sides at 2614 Mission street, was crashed
to death beneath the wheels of car 1004
near the corner of Mission and Twenty
third streets at 8 o'clock last evening.
The little fellow was on an errand for
his mother when he met his shocking
death. His parents were seated near a
front window watching him as he crossed
the sidewalk and started toward the rail
road track.
He turned around and smiled at his lit
tle brother and sister who were playing on
the porch and then continued on his er
rand. He did not glance down the track,
however, and the noise of exploding bombs
drowned the sound of the electric car as it
bore down upon him.
Without looking to the right or left, he
turned to cross the track, and in an instant
the car struck him. Being a little boy, the
fender did not throw him from the track,
but on the contrary it helped to crush out
his life.
Thadey Begley, the motorman, had not
seen the boy on the track and was uncon
scious of the accident until the screams of
a number of lady passengers and the
lurches of the car as it crushed its victim
informed him as to what had happened.
He then put on the brakes, but before the
car came to a standstill the child's body
had been dragged and bumped over the
cobbles for fully 100 feet.
Mrs. Manning, the boy's mother, wit
nessed the accident from her window.
She rushed downstairs screaming, and
reaching the street implored the bystand
ers to save her precious boy ; to take him
from beneath the wheels that she might
try to save his life.
Her appeals were without avail, how
ever, and when the motorman and Martin
Quinlan, who had witnessed the accident,
attempted to lift the remains from under
neath the car they found that the rear
wheels were resting on the child's body
and it could not be removed. Try as they
would, they could not remove the mangled
remains from beneath the wheels. The
car was then moved forward over the body.
It seemed a cruel thing to do, but there
was no help for it, and trie remains were
recovered from their awful position. A
sheet was then procured, and after care
fully wrapping the body it was carried to
the side of the street and tbe Coroner's
ollice was notified.
Deputy Coroner J. G. Tyrrell and Mes
senger T. Smith hurried to the scene that
the body of the little boy might be re
moved before a large crowd congregated.
Fragments of the poor crushed flesh and
bone were found here and there by Mes
senger Smith, who walked along the track
with a lantern the entire distance the
body had been dragged.
As the Coroner's wagon started away
Mrs. Manning swooned away. She was
carried into her home by her husband and
a bystander. She is prostrated with grief
and the father is also heartbroken over the
death of his oldest child. â¢
"No bell was sounded to warn the child
that a car was approaching," said Martin
Quinlan last night. "I was standing on the
porch of my residence, 2021 Mission street,
at the time of the accident and am posi
tive that if the bell had been sounded Wal
ton Manning would now be alive and well.
My Httle daughter, Irene, was standing on
the sidewalr just in front of the place
where the boy was first struck. She says
that the motorman was busily engaged
watching some children set off fireworks
and was not looking ahead of his car as he
should have been doing."
Thadey Begiey, the motorman, was ar
rested by Sergeant John Martin. He was
taken to the City Prison and released on
his own recognizance by Captain Gillen.
Begley, who lives at 10 California ave
nue, said : "I did not see the child. I felt
a jolt and then some people on the side
walk shouted to me that I had run over a
boy. I immediately stopped the car.
That is all I know about it."
MUSICIANS ARE AT WAR,
Objections Made to Letter-Car
riers and to Soldiers
and Sailors.
The Russian Band at the Chutes to
Receive Attention From the
Musicians' Union.
Disclaiming all desire to De aggressive,
the local musicians' union has yet three
interesting battles on its hands, which it
is claimed mast be fought as measures of
self-de/ense and protection.
What has aroused the greatest feeling
and is in consequence enlisting the great
est attention of the union at the present
time is the Letter-carriers' band. This is
composed of the gray-habited mercuries
in the service of Uncle Sam who have de
veloped their musical predilections to an
extent that permits them to enter the
field of competition with regular profes
sional bands.
While the members of the union declare
that they are always pleased to discover
and encourage musical talent, they con
sider ii a great injustice that men earning
regular and fair salaries in the Govern
ment's employ should seek to extend the
â¢lfht hours of their labor. at> decreed by
law, and enter into competition with men
whose earnings are often of a precarious
character.
One of the latest inatancea wherein
members of the union, all of whom are
professionals, were deprived of an oppor
tunity to augment their incomes was in
connection with tbe Sharkey-Corbett
fight. Negotiations were in progress be
tween Mi. Groom of the National Athletic
Club and some of the union men for ihe
musical portion of the Pavilion pugilistic
function, and suddenly, without notice or
apparent cause, they were dropped.
An inquiry by some of the individuals
who had lost an engagement resulted in
their learning that the letter-carriers who
followed music as a lucrative pastime on
the side had agreed to give their services
without cost in return for the privilege of
viewing the fistic encounter. This was the
straw, and it was this which crystallized
the sentiment against the mail-carriers
and determined the union to take action
in the matter.
Another disturbing factor was the ad
vent of the Russian band of fourteen musi
cians, which has been engaged at the
chutes. It was the general opinion that
the regular band would be dispensed with,
and on the strength of this supposition a
letter was written by the secretary of the
union to the manager of the chutes asking
him what his intentions in the matter
were. To this came a reply suggesting a
conference, at which the situation could be
discussed. Yesterday was the first ap
pearance of the Russian band, but in view
of the fact that all of the former union
musicians were also engaged for the day
it is hoped that there may be no friction
arise from this quarter.
It is believed that tbe Russian band
will be used as an ocular attraction rather
than for dispensing music for Jhe chute
audiences. Should such be the case there
will be no ground lor complaint on the
psrt of the unionists.
Tbe third matter that is agitating local
musicians is the persistent competition
met with on the part of the bands con
nected with the regular army and navy
service. Heretofore every local effort to
ameliorate this evil has proved futile.
On Tuesday afternoon there will be a
meeting of the directors of the union and
George Wallenrod, Superintendent of the Alcazar Building, Who Committed
Suicide in the Electrician's Room Yesterday.
these three propositions will be discussed
and means devised to eliminate these dis
cords from the musical atmosphere.
At this meeting a letter will be addressed
to Postmaster McCoppin calling his at
tention to tbe letter-carriers' band and the
double-action, revenue-creating tendency
that they have displayed, and he will be
asked to use his authority to take the
postal musicians out of the field of compe
tition with the professionals.
A committee will be appointed to confer
with the chutes' manager in reference to
the status of the Russian band.
And a committee will be appointed
whose duty it will be to place before Con
gress in an appropriate manner the evils
alleged to result from the competition of
bands connected with the regular army
and navy service throughout the country.
Other unions throughout the United
States are preparing to co-operate in this
matter.
HE SPARED THE BISHOP.
How a Steamboat Captain Tried to
Check Hit Mate's Profanity.
Speaking of swear stories, there is a
mate on the Mississippi who stands pre
eminent among his fellows from St. Paul
to New Orleans for his versatile, sustained
and forcible profanity.
On a recent trip the boat stopped at a
way landing, and as the roustabouts took
to the gangplank at a trifle too leisurely
pace the mate opened his mouth and the
atmosphere became livid with sulphur
and brimstone.
"For heaven's sake, Mike!" exclaimed
the captain in a hoarse whisper from the
boiler-deck, "for heaven's sake, stow that!
Why, man, Bishop is aboard ! Stow it,
man, stow it till we pass Gray Duck, where
he gets off."
A big pile of sacks was to go off, and as
the mate stood there with his every faculty
literally benumbed by the restraint put
upon him, the darkies" at first worked in
silent astonishment and then began dis
tinctly to shirk. It is a well-recogniz a d
fact all up and down the Mississippi that
niggers can't be made to work without be
ing "cussad," and this fact soon came
home to the mate with telling force.
Grasping his stick with a firmer clutch
he raised his big, hoarse voice and fairly
thundered:
"Hi, there, you nigger sons! Get along
there, yon blank, blank, blank! You
Know what kind of a blank I mean. Con
found you, get along now!"
And passengers on that boat say the
darkies looked like black streaks as they
moved up and down the gangplank after
that, while the reverend Bishop, who had
come to the rail, looked on, nearly burst
ing his sides with laughter.â New "Orleans

A Coolness Brtween Them.

Gabbyâ When ar those friends of yours
going to be married?
Crustyâ l don't know, i noticed a cool
ness between them last night.
â¢ l', You d Â°n't say. What was the cause of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1896.
GEO, WALLENROD
ENDS HIS LIFE,
Sends a Bullet Through
His Brain at the Al
cazar.
NO CAUSE IS KNOWN.
Was in His Usual Health and
Spirits a Few Minutes
Before.
SAID HE WAS GOING HOME.
But Turned Into the Electrician's
Room, Looked in a Mirror and
Pulled the Trigger.
George Wallenrod, superintendent of the
Alcazar building, committed suicide yes
terday afternoon by blowing out bis brains.
The act occurred in the seclusion of the
Alcazar electrician's office in the building
at some time in the afternoon not exactly
known.
No reasonable cause is known. His son
George, â¢ who is assistant cashier of the
theater, says his father's only trouble that
; he knows of was a physical one, a case of
catarrh that caused him the loss of sleep.
At about a quarter of 7 o'clock A. Gru
ner, the electrician of the building, accom
panied by O. C.'Grindell, the electrician of
the theater, and Andrew Hare, the janitor,
went down the narrow flight of stairs lead
ing from the street into the electrician's
room, which is under the sidewalk in front
of the building. "â¢
Gruner noticed that the door was ajar
and remarked the fact to the others as he
pushed it back and all three entered.
The room was dimly lighted by means
of the thick glass in the sidewalk over
head, but it was sufficient to reveal the
body lying outstretched, face downward,
upon the floor.
Gruner uttered an exclamation of sur
prised alarm. The others leaned forward.
"It loots like the old man." said Hall.
The electric-lights were turned on. !
They found that it was indeed "the old
man," as they were accustomed to call
him, as a term of endearmentâ for old
George Wallenrod was loved by all who
knew him.
The body was cold and stiff, and had
evidently been dead many hours.
A cheap imitation Smith & Wesson re
volver lay near him; a chair, that he had
evidently grasped when falling, lay across
his body. His life's blood and brains had
poured out about him on the floor.
About 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon
! George Wallenrbd left his son in the thea
ter, wearing the' appearance of his usual
good spirits. He went into the bar which
is connected with the theater and took a
drink of whisky and remarked to the bar
keeper that he was going home to dinner.
From what followed it is supposed that
he went straight to the little underground
room and, standing before a looking-glass
that is fastened against the wall, pointed
the revolver at the center of his forehead
and fired. The pistol dropped at his right
band and as he fell his hand grasped the
back of a chÂ»ir which had a fixed place
under the glass. The body swayed around
and fell face downward across the floor and
the chair fell on top of it, and George
Wollenrod had made Irs exitâ one of the 1
last men in the world that those who i
knew him would have suspected of volun
tarily making this tragic end.
No one was better known in theatrical
and business circles. He was one of the
"old timers" and no man Can name an
enemy of his. He bad none. He was un- j
invariably cherished as a friendâ a kind, |
considerate, genial friend a good com- j
pan ion.
He superintended' the construction of
the Alcazar building as one of the firm of !
Wallenrod, Osbourne Â«fe Stock well. He was
manager of the theater for the first ' few
years afterward and since was superin
tendent of the entire building.
There is no suspicion of there being any
thing, wrong with Mr. Wallenrod's finan
cial . affairs. Just before . Mr. de Young
left, for the East, a few weeks ago, his
books were examined and found to be all
right. > / â  , â¢ â¢; - -.:
= Mr. Wallenrod was 65 years of age. He
leaves a widow and three children, George
W. Jr., assistant treasurer of the Alcazar
Theater; Lee, in the employ of the .Market
street Railway Company; and a married
daughter, Mrs. Gerhard.
The tragedy came upon them with the
force of a terrible blow.
The body was removed to the undertak
ing parlors of H. C. Porter & Co., Eddy
street. The few personal effects, after be
ing examined by the Coroner, were turned
over to the members of the family.
Mr. Wallenrod was a native of Leipsic,
Germany, his birth having occurred June
23, 1835. He was but a child when his par
ents reached New York and had only at
tained his fifteenth year when he came to
California.
After working in the mines with varying
success he took to the hotel business in
California and Nevada. In 1868 he settled
permanently in this City and commenced
a mercantile career. Alter five years as a
merchant he entered the employ of Charles
de Young in the business department of
the San Francisco Chronicle, where he re
mained for ten years.
He was entrusted with the superinten
dency of the erection 0/ the Alcazar build
ing, and upon its completion assumed the
management. The opening night of that
pretty place of amusement was an event
in the theatrical circles of San Francisco,
the leading role of the performance being I
taken by Miss Emma Nevada. For four
years Mr. Wallenrod was the efficient
manager of that theater.
Mr. Wallenrod was personally agree
able and affable in manner, entertaining
in conversation and of a genial, sociable
and kindly disposition. As a result, he
was a general favorite with all who came
much in contact with him, especially
among the old pioneers of E! Dorado. He
wae a member of the Knights of Honor, of
the Improved Order of Red Men and of the
Grand Army of the Republic.
He held an honorary membership in the
latter organization, conferred on him by
reason of tbe many kindnesses and cour
tesies extended to the various G. A. R.
posts in this City and vicinity. He was
ever ready to aid by benefits at tbe thea
ter under his control and otherwise the
organization, and so merited the kindly
feeling and appreciation of the old veteran
soldiers.
A SIGNAL PROM MARS.
A Question Unanawered, Perhaps XJn-
answerable.
Year after yea*-, when politics ceases
from troubling, there recurs the question
as to the existence of intelligent, sentient
life on the planet Mars. The last outcrop
of speculations grew trom the discovery
by M. Javelie of a luminous projection on
the southern edge of the planet. The
light was peculiar in several respects, and,
among other interpretations, it was sug
gested that the inhabitants of Mars were
flashing messages to the conjectured in
habitants of the sister planet, earth. No
attempt at reply was made; indeed , sup
posing our astronomer royal, with our
best telescopes, transported to Mars, a red
riot of fire running arhwart the whole of
Ix)ndon would scarce be visible to him.
The question remains unanswered, prob
ably unanswerable.
There is no doubt that Mars is very lite
the earth. Its days and nights, its sum
mers and winters differ only in their rela
tive lengths from ours. It has land and
oceans, continents and islands, mountain
ranges and inland seas. Its joiar regions
â¢re covered with snows, and it has an at
mosphere and clouds, warm sunshine and
gentle rains. The spectroscope, that sub
tle analyst of the most distant stars, gives
us reason to believe that the chemical ele
ments familiar to us here exist on Mars.
The planet, chemically and physically, is
so like the earth that, as protoplasm, the
only living material we know came into
existence on the earth, there is no great
difficulty in supposing that it came into
existence on Mars.
If reason be able to guide us, we know
that protoplasm, at first amorphous and
unintegrated, has been guided on this
earth by natural forces into that marvel
ous series of forms and integrations we
call the animal ana vegetable kingdoms.
Why, under the similar guiding forces on
Mars, should not protoplasm be the root of
as fair a branching tree of living beings,
and bear as fair a fruit of intelligent, senti
ent creatures?â Saturday Review.

BELLBOYS QUIT
THE BALDWIN,
Say They Were Asked to
Work Eighteen Hours
a Day.
OBJECT TO THEIR FOOD.
Numerous Grievances Cited, but
Only One Which Caused
the Strike.
PROPRIETOR STONE IXPLAIN3.
He Says a Few Boys Who Were Hay-
ing an Easy Time Were
Discharged.
A number of the bellboys of the Bald
win Hotel are on a strike. Just how many
of the lads are standing ujion their rights
it is difficult to ascertain, owing to the
remarkable variance in the stories of the
principals to the controversy, but it is
somewhere between five and seventeen,
with the chances in favor of a number
nearer the latter figure.
The grievances of the "bellhops," as de
tailed by C. F. McKenzie, one of the strik
ers, are numerous.
"Last month," said McKenzie, "there
was a reduction of wages all through the
house. We were reduced from $15 a
month to $12 50 and we made no com
plaint whatever. The 'grub' there isn't
fit to eat and last week we got up a peti
tion to have the fare improved. The
bottom seems to have fa'lrn out of the
petition and we heard nothing from it and
the 'grub* remained 'rotten.' But still
we didn't kick.
"To-night, when we went on duty, the
head bellman told us that hereafter our
hours would be twelve hours one day and
eighteen hours tae next. That would
leave us only six hours to sleep on the
days when we had our long shifts. Before
this we have been working twelve hours
one day and six hours the next. We
thought this was long enough, and we
couldn't stand working eighteen hours.
''We have no kind of an organization,
but we all clubbed together in the assem
bly-room on the first floor and decided we
didn't want to work at the Baldwin. We
had no kick at Mr. Lake, the manager.
He is as good a man as a hoy ever worked
for, but he gets his orders from Mr. Stone,
the proprietor, and he has to obey. We
knew what Stone's plan was. lie was
gome to take the boys off tbe doors and,
by having us work double time, reduce
the force. We decided ail we wanted
was our pay, and we made no other de
mand. Stone tried to get a chance to taik
to us separately, but we told him if he had
anything to say to us to say it to all of us.
He then refused to pay us because we had
left without putting boys in our places.
He told us to come around to-morrow
morning, though."
The story told by Stone differs wonder
fully from that of the boys. He says that
six boys were discharged because they re
fused to obey order*. He denied that he
had asked the boys to work eighteen
hours, but admitted he had arranged to
dispense with the services of some of the
boys by prolonging the hours of others.
He declared that this in no case exceeded
twelve-hour shifts, including two hours for
meals. He ascribed the trouble to the tact
that the boys had been having such an
easy time that now, when retrenchments
are in order, they thought they would be
the first ones let out- In proot of his
statement that the bellboys were well
treated he called a uniformed lad to him
and inquired :
"Are you ever overworked?"
T c boy bowed and said with emphasis,
"No, sir-ee."
Stone says he will pay all the boys to
day, and only failed to do so last night be

"Say, I'm in love," confided the faro
dealer to the lookout during a lull in the
play.
"Why, you don't know what love is,"
laughed the lookout.
"Don't you believe it," retorted the
dealer. "Love is a game that Cupid deals.
He has a crooked layout, and the bank
wins every bet. If you copper a case in his
game it's sure to win; if you play a case
open it loses, and you's in big luck if you

rolling into the quiet haven which they
have worn for themselves between the
lateral spurs of the coast range. The great
sequoias on the mountains have breasted
the storms of centuries.
Our time is the sixteenth century, won
derful for adventure and discovery. The
world opened by Columbus was the ultima
thule of every idealist, the coveted pos
session of kings and popes.
At first America was thought to be only
a chain of islands bordering the coast of
Cathay, and every explorer sought eagerly
for a channel through them, the rumored
passage being already named the "Straits
of Anian."
Twenty-five years elapsed after America
was discovered before Balboa stood "silent
upon a peak in Darien" and saw the hori
zonless Western sea. Seven years later
Magellan sailed through the straits which
bear his name, and after great perils
found himself upon the vast calm ocean
which he named the Pacific. Fourteen
years later great Cortez, after his conquest
of Mexico, sent out explorers to find the
western boundaries of his New Spain.
One of the ships was commanded by an
old pirate named Ximenes, who sailed
into the Gulf of California and landed on
t.:e coast of the lower peninsula, where
he was murdered by Indians. He was
probably the first white discoverer of
Lower California. Later Cortez himself
visited and tried in vain to establish a
colony on the same point. In 1537 he sent
an expedition, headed by Francisco de
Ulloa, which sailed around the peninsula,
but did not quite reach our present boun
dary line. It is in this captain's record
that the name California first appears,
taken from a popular romance of the day.
In 1542, when Mendoza had taken the
place of Cortez as Viceroy of Mexico, Juan
Rodriguez Cabrillo, a Portuguese captain,
was sent to cruise still further along this
unknown coast. He had but two little
vessels and as they sailed northward
Cabriilo kept careful record of hfs discov
eries and experiences.
On the 28th of September, 1542, they
sailed into a harbor which he described as
"famous" and named "San Miguel." It
was our .San Diego. A wild storm was
blowing but the little vessels found safe
anchorage, and Cabrillo carefully describes
the timid and gentle natives who came
out in their boats to greet the strangers
and bid them welcome.
All through the month of October Cabrillo
crept northward, anchoring at Santa Bar
bara and carefully exploring and naming
the outlying islands. Here he met with
an accident by which he broke his arm,
and as it was tightly bandaged after the
cruel fashion of that day, it became a
source of infinite pain and trouble, but he
pushed bravely on with his voyage. On
November 14. buffeted by a fierce gale,
they were driven along a coast which Ca
brillo describes as covered with pine trees.
At dawn on the morning of the 16th of
November, 1542, they drifted in to a large
open bay which they named "Bahia de los
Pinos,' while the point of land to the
south they called "Cabo de Pinos." It was
.Monterey Bay.
The weather continued rough and they
returned to their old port at an island
near Santa Barbara, where poor Cabrillo
died on January 3, 1543.- With his dying
breath he urged upon his successor to con
tinue the exploration as soon as the
weather would permit. A fine, sturdy
type of the sailor he must have been in
deed. His comrades named the island
Juan Rodriguez, as a memorial, and
buried hia body in its shifting sands. But
the island soon lost his name and of his
grave there is no trace. When Cali
fornians are casting about for a fit subject
for monumental honors they may well re
member Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo.
Fifty years went by and not a vessel's

Fifty years went by and not a vessel's
keel stirred the waters of the bay. The
pines looked down upon the dusky deni
zens of the forest in their childlike joys
and sorrows, their feasts and their fam
ines. Herds of deer sped through the
tangled wilderness. Great bears crept
down from their mountain lair 3 and
feasted on the leviathans of the deep
which were occasionally cast up by the
waves. The waters ebbed and flowed
under the moon and only the light canoe
glided across them.
In June, 1579, Captain Drake went sail
ing by in his lem peat- tossed ship, the
Golden Hind, searching for new lands and
new treasures for good Queen Bess, but
he totally overlooked our bay.
In the fall ol 1603 another explorer, one
Sebastian Viscaino, was fitted out by the
Viceroy of Mexico. He had three ships,
with 200 men and three Carmelite friars
on board. One of these friars, Antonio de
l'Ascension, was n faithful chronicler and
map-maker. The Viceroy, like his prede
cessors, wished to gain fresh subjects for
Spain, fresh converts for the church, good
harbors for the Spanish galleons on their
way to and from the Indies, and last but
not leas', the much-sought-for Straits of
Anian were still to be found. Viscaino
sailed in the wake of poor Cabrillo, but
must needs change the names which he
had given to places. On the 14th of De
cember they found and named beautiful
Carmel Bay, and on the 17th Viscaino' a
fleet rounded Point Pinos and dropped
anchor in the pine-fringed bay, which he
named Monterey in honor of the Viscount
de Monterey, Viceroy of Mexico. On the
next day the church tent, which was
always carried by these early missionaries,
was pitched under a grand old oak at the
entrance of a ravine where were springs of
fresh water. The place is well known
still, though the old oak perished long ago.
It must forever be the California Plymouth
Rock.
Viscaino's little' company were in sore
distress. Sixteen of the men bad died on
the voyage and all the crews were suffer
ing from scurvy. It was decided to send
back one of the ships with the sick men,
twenty-live of whom died before reaching
Acapulco. Five days later Viscaino with
the remaining ships proceeded on their
northern trip, but they stayed long
enough in Monterey Bay to note with en
thusiasm its fine qualities as a harbor,
while an expedition on shore revealed to
them its fertile soil, abundant game, plen
tiful wood and water and beautiful
scenery. Padre L'Ascension was the first
appreciative chronicler of Monterey Bay
and to him Spain was also indebted for the
first map of the coast approaching accur
acy. Viscaino sailed north amid great
hardships for many leagues and then re
turned to Mexico. He carried personally
to Spain the story of his wonderful
voyage.
And now another long period of solitude
befell our bay. Spain had many wars and
imbroglios always on hand and the first
enthusiasm for exploration had abated.
A hundred and sixty years went
by. Bears still held our mountain
passes and sea lions ruled the bay
and made havoc with smaller fry in
quite human fashion. Some aged Indian
might remember a tale his grandfather
had told him of a visit from white sons of
the gods who came in winged ships and
having performed strange ceremonies
sailed away into the sunset, but doubtless
the new generation listened with in
credulity.
During this whole period the lower pen
insula had been the scene of one heroic
effort alter another made by Jesuit mis
sionaries from Mexico to colonize the land
and christianize the natives. It is a re
cord of sublime faith and heroism almost
unparalleled in history. These soldiers of
the cross gloried in tribulation and re
joiced in martyrdom.
In Spain, however, the Jesuits had com
bined political intriguing with religious
zeal, and King Carlos banished the order
from his kingdom. This edict included
Mexico, and the Jesuit missions in
Lower California were turned over to
the Franciscan monks, who had a
large college at San Fernando, Mex
ico, with Padre Junipero Serra as presi
dent. In 1768 King Carlos, who naturally
feared that England or Russia might for
get his prior claims on the whole western
coast of America, sent orders to the Mexi
can Viceroy to again take possession of
the old ports of San Diego and Monterey
and renew efforts for colonization. The
matter was put in the hands of Jose de
Galvez, a trusted servantof the King. He
was a man of energy and ability and ad
dressed himself to his task. He took
counsel with Father Serra. who was as
eager as himself for the undertaking, and
together they organized a lar^e expedi
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1896.
tjon, consisting of soldiers, priests and
Christian Indians from the Mexican mis
sions.
They were provided with ail the need
ful things and were to proceed, half of
them by land and half by sea, to their new
fields of labor. Two vessels, the San Car
los and the San Antonio, were fitted out
and loaded with provisions, grain and
seeds, church materials, etc. Each vessel
had its share of soldiers, mechanics, cooks,
sailors and religious guides.
The land expedition was headed by a
brave soldier, Ga3par de Portala, with
twenty-five soldiers, three muleteers and
many Indians. Father Juan Crespi and
Father Serra were of this party. To the
carefully kept diary of the former all our
California historians are greatly indebted,
while Father Serra' s name is indissoiubly
linked with early California missions. He
was feeble in health and lame almost to
helplessness, but always cheerful, resolute
and heroic. Nearly forty days they
marched through desert and wilderness
ere they reached San Diego Bay and saw
the white sails of the San Car
los and San Antonio gleaming before
them. Many of the Indians had de
serted the land expedition and many of
the sailors had died from scurvy. They
counted now but 126 men where 219 had
started, but great was their joy over their
rescue. On Sunday they celebrated a
solemn festival, mass was said, a cross set
up and formal possession taken of the land
for the church and for Spain.
So many of the men were sick that they
decided to send them back by the San An
tonio, wiiile the rest divided into two par
ties, one staying at San Diego for mis
sion work and one pushing north to Mon
terey.
Portala took command of the Monterey
expedition. After only five days of rest
he started north with Father Crespi and
sixty-four soldiers, muleteers and Indians.
They followed the coast line, hastening on
through the pathless wilderness, enduring
much hardship and keeping careful notes
of all they saw. They were charmed with
the climate and pleased with the poor na
tives, who treated them with great friend
liness. Father Crespi baptized some of
the Indian children, givme them sweet
Christian names. At Los Angeles they
felt violent shocks of earthquake, but
they were not intimidated. The moun
tains seemed to rise interminably, but
they pushed on. They passed Monterey
Bay without recognizing it, and worn and
footsore reached San Francisco Bay,which
they named for their patron saint, a name
never changed. Exhausted, sick, and
with scanty rations, they now decided to
turn back.
They reached Monterey the second time
November 28, 1769, and stopping at Carmel
Bay set up a cross and buried at its foot a
brief report of their expedition as a guide
to future explorers, should they never
reach their friends at San Diego. But
January 24, 1770, saw the little bands once
more united. Sickness and trouble had
abounded there, and the expected ships
from Mexico containing supplies had not
arrived. Two days were devoted to
earnest prayer for succor, and lo! the res
cuing ships appeared.
Early in the spring Portala again set out
by land for Monterey with Father Crespi
and twenty-five men, while Father Serra
took all the provisions and re-enforce
ments which could be sparod from San
Diego and proceeded by vessel to the same
port. On the 24th of May Portala, after a
little over a month's marching, reached
his destination and found his cross hung
with votive offerings from the poor natives,
who recognized its religious character.
As Portala and Credpi walked by the sea
that lovely day in May their eyes were
opened to see that this was indeed Vis
caino's Bay of Monterey, and no one has
ever since doubted its identity. A week
later the San Antonio came safely to port
with Padre Serra. The little company of
soldiers and sailors made haste to assem
ble on the beach by the historic oak tree,
and again solemn services of prayer and
praise were held.
The mission bells are hung on a tree,
and peal forth joyously; the fathers, in
full religious dress, chant "Veni Cre
ator"; holy water is sprinkled upon the
ground; an image of the Virgin is set up
on a rude altar; mass is said, and the ar
tillery and cannon thunder, while Portala
runs up the Spanish flag. Monterey is
once more taken for God and Spain!
A feast followed, full of enjoyment for
all. The mission was named the San
Carlos, in honor of the King of Spain. In
a few days some rude huts were built, and
one consecrated and decorated for a
church. Portala appointed one of hit
men, Lieutenant Fages, comandante,
and on the 9th of July set sail in the An
tonio for Mexico. Portala wa9 Califor
nia's first Governor, and, though his term
of office wa? only a few months, his brave
work as explorer and founder should give
him a hi eh place in remembrance. The
news of the establishment of two col
onies gave great joy in Spain and in
Mexico.
And now, left to- themselves, Father
Serra and Father Crespi enthusiastically
began their work. The poor savages â
gentiles &b the fathers always called
them â were not hard" to win. The friars
were gentle and wise. Their plan was to
allure, not to force, and a few gifts gener
ally brought about friendly relations.
All mission history goes to prove
that the Franciscan fathers were noble,
pure, self-sacrificing men, and their treat
ment of the Indians fair and philan
thropic. They assumed a paternal atti
tude, encouraging and chidinjr, rewarding
and punishing very like parents.
Father Serra particularly was always
winning. He loved his flock with tender
fervor and joyfully devoted his life to
their salvation. No hardship? were too
great, no journey too long or too hazard
ous for his loving zeal. His plan was to
convert these "gentiles" and then organ
ize them into civilized communities. They
soon decided to move the mission over to
Carmel Bay, a more sheltered spot, and
here a church was built, while the fort
and its garrison, called the Presidio, was
left at Monterey. The buildings at both
places were inclosed by. a stockade con
sisting of posts firmly set in the ground
and the buildings themselves had walls
made in the same way and roofed with
grass or tules supported by rafters. These
were plastered with mud inside and out.
The Indian converts were persuaded to
build similar huts near the mission and a
group of these was called a rancheria.
Fresh supplies with livestock of every
kind arrived from Mexico and the whole
mission scheme developed rapidly. With
in the stockade of the Presidio were bar
racks for the soldiers and a chapel for
worship. The two establishments, mili
tary and religious, were kept distinct,
each having its own rules. Cannon
were mounted at the Presidio and
everything possible done to give
security to thÂ«; colony, but they were piti
fully weak and fortunately no foe ever ap
peared on sea or shore. Fifteen miles
square was given each mission in Califor
nia by the Spanish Government to be used
for pasture, woodland and farms. The na
tives wore enticed into the mission bounds
by daily rations of food. The poor sav
age had too often felt the pangs of hunger
to be able to resist this bribe. Plenty of
boiled corn and a few simple lessons in
theology mado a "gentile" willing and
prepared for baptism, and he took his
place with the converts, but was never
classed with the "gentes de razon" (reason
able men), as white men were termed.
Soon the Indians became quite skillful
in the arts of agriculture and stock-rais
ing. A little later they learned spinning,
weaving and some simple manufactures.
It was very different from their old wan
dering, free life, and it required some co
ercion to hold them to it, but patience
conquered. If they escaped from the fold
they were brought back like stray cattle.
It was but a few years ere the converts
were counted by thousands, the mission
granaries were full to bursting, and the
mission herds overrpn the whole country.
But it was not all smooth sailing with
the mission fathers. Besides the nat
ural troubles which arose from deal
ing with savatres, there was quite as
much difficulty in managing lawloss sol
diers and interfering comandantes.
Questions of authority between church
and state constantly arose. Father Serra
even made a journey to Mexico to try and
have these vexed questions settled, but to
the end there was always much friction.
As years went by new missions were
started. Father Serra delighted to set
forth with a guard of soldiers, a few help
ers and some church supplies to found a
new station. The process was always
about the same. The cross was set up on
a good site, the place consecrated, a little
building commenced and a good priest left
in charge. Serra frequently visited these
stations to advise and help, but always re
turned to his beloved San Carlos, where
he lived to old/ age and died in 1784 be
loved and lamented by all.
The growth of pueblos began. Any one
wishing to settle in California could have
a small grant or lease of land. Many sol
diers bad families and retired from service
to settle on ranches. Emigrants and sol
diers not infrequently married Indian
women and thus the duties and the cares
of the fathers increased. Each pueblo or
settlement had its Alcalde, or Governor,
and matters civil and ecclesiastical gradu
ally adjusted themselves. It was only on
rare occasions that a ship entered the bay.
There was absolutely no commerce and
the only communication with the outside
world was through the transports whic i
once or twice a year brought supplies from
Mexico and through the annual visit of a
Spanish galleon on its return from the
East Indies. Couriers from Mexico came
overland twice a year bringing and carry
ing letters and official communications.
In September, 1786, two French frigates
on an exploration for scientific ends came
to the bay and had a most cordial recep
tion. The commander, La Perouse, wrote
up the country, the mission and the
natives, with careful scientific observa
tions.
But isolated as California was great loy
aity to Spain was felt. They celebrated
all the great events of that country as best
they could when the news reached them,
and several times made a liberal donation
to the ever empty Spanish exchequer.
Monterey ws athe seat of the little court.
Governors were appointed from Mexico,
and when one became tired or failed to
please he was succeeded by another. The
legend is often repeated that fifteen Gov
ernors of California lie buried in old Car
mel Mission. Life at the Presidio was
gay, easy and in many ways attractive to
the Spanish heart. There were usually
about sixty men there, many of them with
families. Pretty strict discipline was
maintained both there and in the pueblo.
Gambling and drinking were both held in
check, and but few crimes are recorded in
the mission period.
A mission was successfully started at
Santa Cruz in 1791. and a settlement
named Branciforte for the Viceroy of Mex
ico. The paternal Government helped
them in every way as usual. It is note
worthy that a flouring-mill, run by water
power, was built at Branciforte in 1796.
Captain George Vancouver of England,
with two ships, came into the bay in these
days on his famous exploring tour around
the world, and was most hospitably re
ceived.
But after he was gone the loyal colon
ists becan to suspect that the English
were spying out their weakness, and when
Vancouver returned they were decidedly
cool, which led Vancouver to enter in his
notebook that the people of New Albion,
as he called California, according to
Drake's naming, were an inferior set of
folks and would never improve till they
had some commerce with other nations.
In 1794 Don Diego Borica became Gov
ernor, and a stirring, cheerful good ruler
he was. He wrote home charming letters
full of the praises of Monterey. "It is the
most peaceful country in the world," he
writes; "one can live better here than at
any European court." The garrison was
full of good soldiers, the mission with
holy priests and gentle neophytes, accord
ing to Borica. Spain decided to strengthen
her California colonies, and Borica was
just the man for the work. More soldiers
and cannon were sent, and two vessels
cruised up and down as a sort of coast
guard. No foreigu vessels were allowed to
send men ashore except for wood and
water.
And now came the first Yankee trading
vessel, the Otter, from Boston. They had
papers from General George Washington
and were well treated, but the captain, it
is reported, secretly sent ashore s-ome
convicts who had boarded his vessel at
some Mexican port. Borica was greatly
displeased, but the convicts were set to
work and did no harm. They may be an
cestors, for aught that appears, to some of
our first families.
It was in these prosperous times that
the fine old partly stone church of Monte
rey was built. It has been greatly changed,
but is on the old foundation.
The pueblo of Monterey grew and im
proved and very cheerful life went on in
its homes. Little children were very nu
merous, and in 1793 an order came from
Spain for the establishment of a school in
each pueblo, and Borica set himself vig
orously at the founding of schools.
He found in his quest for teachers that
only fourteen out of the fifty soldiers in
the Presidio could read or write. Finally
Jose Rodriguez, a soldier and carpenter,
in 1795 started the first public school in
Monterey. In these schools Christian doc
trine was the first thing to be taught, then
reading ana writing. The Government
furnished paper for copy-books, and as
oon as these were filled with pothooks
and hangers they were to be sent to Borica
for inspection and afterward were econom
ically used for cartridge?.
Bo life went on. New industries were
introduced. "Woolen cloth was made and
coarse pottery. Hides were tanned and
leather made into shoes and saddles. Ot
ters were trapped for their skins and trad
ing vessels, Yankee and otherwise, began
to creep in and, in spite of obstacles inter
posed by the Government and the padres,
to carry on a brisk exchange of commodi
ties. Tallow and hides were exported in
great quantities. Bright-colored calicoes
and other finery were eagerly paid for with
valuable skins; the world could not be
kept out. The pines of Monterey were
also in demand for building purposes all
up and down the coast and in Mexico.
The friars came and went at San Carlos.
Chief among them after Serra was Lasuen,
president of all the missions. At the
height of the mission period there were
a thousand neophytes at San Carlos, and
the possessions of the mission in grain,
cattle and land were almost incredible â so
good was the management and so fertile
the country.
Good Governor Borica wrote his opinion
of the country on the occasion of the ad
vent of a little native son in his own fam
ily; "He is a Californian. Oh, a Califor
nian ! It is the best country in the world
to live in long and well."
Among other good regulations of Borica' s
was an approximately good temperance
law. A sergeant who kept brandy for sale
was only allowed to sell two drinks iv the
morning and one in the evening to the
same person. There were 400 residents in
Monterey in Borica's day. His health at
last failed and he started for Mexico, but
died on the voyage in 1799.
The years were rather uneventful till
1818, wken there was a general uprising in
South America and piratical craft were
abundant on the Pacific. Much fear was
felt at Monterey lest some of these cruisers
should sweep down upon them and ravage
the little settlement. Much preparation was
made, but they knew they were literally
helpless before heavily armed privateers.
Vicente de Sola was Governor, and he was
in great alarm when news came that two
piratical vessels were fitting out in the
Sandwich Islands to attack the settlements.
Wild excitement prevailed. The com
andante and Governor decided to send
women, children and movable goods to
the interior station of Salinas, and it was
well that this was done, for on the 20th of
November, 1818, two vessels commanded
by Bonchere, a Frenchman, long remtftn
bered as "the Pirate Boucher," sailed into
the bay and demanded the surrender of
the town. There is a Spanish report of a
blustering reply and a gallant defense, but
it cannot be sustained, and the probability
is that Bouchere found spiked guns and a
deserted town. He proceeded to ransack
the buildings for booty and then set them
on fire. On the morning of the 27th the
marauders departed, leaving San Carlos
Mission undisturbed.
All the missions contributed to repair
ing the damage, and life soon went on as
usual at Monterey.
In 1822, when Mexico threw off the yoke
of Spain, theCalifornians were hardly dis
turbed. Mexico had really been their
ruler. Only the form of official oath was
changed.
In I*2l, when Mexico became a republic,
California became a territory with a
"chief" appointed by Mexico. And now
the Mexican Government, always poor
and in straits, began to look wistfully at
the great possessions of the California
missions. If they could only somehow be
transferred to the state. They must be
"secularized," and they were.
It was the beginning of the end. A few
years confiscated all the mission property.
Colonists were sent by the shipload to set
tle upon the mission lands.
The ship Natalia was bought to be used
as a transport. It was the ship, said tra
dition, which carried the great Napoleon
back to France from Elba, and one day it
anchored in Monterey Bay with a load of
unwelcome emigrants. A tierce gale drove
it upon the beach, where it soon went to
pieces. Only three lives were lost, but the
mission padres did not fail *o see in its
wreck a direct visitation of God. Its dis
mantled hulk, witli the bare black masts
reaching up through the waves, have
pointed many a moral and adorned many
a tale of Monterey.
The padres would not tolerate the as
sumptions of these poor colonists, and
proceeded to destroy the mission stock to
prevent its falling into their hands. Good
beef and mutton were never so cheap be
fore or since in Monterey. A time of
anarchy set in. Each new Governor sent
from Mexico was more distracted than his
predecessor. The missions fell into rains;
the neophytes went back into savagery.
But immigrants now came from new
directions; hunters and trappers from the
northwest. Renegade sailors, retired
soldiers and sea captains who had spied
out tiie fatness of the land took possession
of ranches to which by hoot or by crook
they obtained a title, married Spanish or
Indian belles and became bona-nde settlers.
Some of Monterey's best citizens arrived
in these days of misrule and confusion be
tween 1820 and 1840. Among these t\ ere
David Spence, a canny Scotchman; Jame3
Stokes and James Watson, both English
men, as was also W. P. Hartnell.
Thomas Larkin, long and well-known
as United States Consul in Mon
terey, was an energetic Yankee arri
val of this period. He brought to Cali
fornia the first Yankee wife, and their
home in Monterey was a center of culture
and kindness and fine hospitality for a
quarter of a century.
About 1825 David Douglass, a botanist,
agent of the British Geographical Society,
visited Monterey and made careful notes
of its flora. His name is linked with many
of our plants as their discoverer.
A new native California party grew up
and added to the political complications
which we shall not try to follow. The
Mexican flag always floated over Monterey,
but sometimes one faction held sway,
sometimes another. The ordinary citizen
when he took his daily siesta could never
have been much surprised to find a new
Governor in power when he awoke, and a
new and more grandicose pronunciamento
plastered on the adobe walls of the pueblo.
In 1840 a certain Governor Alvarado
thought he discovered a deep plot for in
surrection among the foreign residents,
and so had them all put in irons and
shipped to San Bias. Perhaps he thought
seasickness an antidote for treason! The
Mexican Government, however, had no
desire to tight, England, France and
America all at once, and sent them
promptly home. During this twenty-five
years ot Mexican and native Californian
rule this bay must have heard much,
strong language, but it is pleasant to re
cord there was no bloodshed.
In 1842 there were 15,000 people in Cali
fornia, 2000 of whom were Americans and
saw that some day the United States would*
claim California, but there were many
English and Scotch settlers, who hoped to
see the British flag overhead. Meanwhile
all bided their time and joined more or
less heartily ia the gay life of the country.
Everywhere there was plenty. Fleet
horses and fat cattle roamed toe hills, and
though ranchers claimed and branded
their own the horsethief felt that
his rights were as strong as
any man's, especially if he were
on the horse. The cowboy reigned
supreme. Ranches extended illim
itably. The owner, Don this or Senor
that, lived in a long, adobe house and was
a native prince. He ate beef, tortillas,
tomales and beans, made savory with,
peppers and garlic and olive oil. He gal
loped all day on his fleet bronco and
danced all night in the merry fandango,
while every Sunday and saint's day there
'was a bullfight, or a bear-baiting, or a
horserace, most delightful to see. It was
California's age of romance. The missions
fell into ruin, but the priest maintained a
gentle tway, married the young folks,
christened the babies, comforted the dying,
buried the dead.
In 1842 an American warship, the Cyane,
sailed into the bay, commanded by Com
modore Jones. He knew that the United
States was on the brink of war with Mex
ico and he also knew that an English ship
of war lay at Callao, Peru, and might any
hour approach California to take posses
sion. He thought he could not be too
prompt, so he sent a boat ashore demand
ing the surrender of the country to the
United States Government. Alvarado
thought there was no way but to submit,
so up went the stars and stripes, but only
for a few hours. Thomas O. Larkin, the
leading American citizen, acted as media
tor and counseled delay, so Commodore
Jones took down the flag with apologies.
It would be delightful to tell the story
of that 7th of July, 1846, when Commo
dore Sloat of the United States frigate Sa

The .Man Who Raised the Flag
He Was J^idskipman or\ the Sa^ar\r\aK
Under Commodore Sloat
Strangely enough, it was the experience
of William P. Toler. now of Oakland but
in early days a midshipman in the United
States navy, to see the American flag run
up at Monterey as a token of taking pos
session of California, on two separate occa
sions, he personally raising it the
second time. The first occasion was
on October 19, 1842, when the flag
was raised by order of Commodore
Thomas Ap Catesby Jones. The sec
ond was on July 7, 1846, when the
American flag was put up to stay by com
mand of Commodore Sloat. So far as can
be ascertained Mr. Toler is the only sur
vivor of those who were officially present
on both of these interesting occasions.
Mr. Toler has related interestingly to
a representative of The Call what he per
sonally observed and did at that period.
"When the American forces were landed
at Monterey to hoist the flag and to take
possession of the country on July 7, 1846,"
said he, "I was charged with the duty of
having the flag raised on the staff near the
custom-house, which building still re
mains. I was not directed personally to
raise the flag, ot course, but to see that it
was done at the proper time after the
proclamation had been read. I was a
young midshipman on board of the Sa
vannah and was Commodore Sloal's aid.
I was not 21 years oid and I think that the
importance of that occasion may not have
been as fully impressed upon me as it
since has been.
"The flag to be raised was carried ashore
by a quartermaster, who had it under his
arm. I do not recollect his name, But I
know that he must have been a superior
seaman or he could not have been Quar
termaster. Soon after breakfast, some
time between 9 and 10 o'clock, I think,
the sailors and marines, under command
of Captain Mervine of the Savannah,
numbering about 250 in all, went asnore.
Commodore Sloat was on board of the
Savannah at that time and did not go
ashore until after the proclamation had i
been read and the flag was flyinsr.
"It was a clear day, with little wind.
The boats proceeded in order, meeting
with no opposition or demonstration, to
the beach. There was near the custom
house a small pier, or seawall, made of
rough stones, taken, I suppose, from the
bluffs near by, projecting out far enough
to furnish a smooth space for a boat land
ing. This had been constructed for the
use of merchant vessels, to give easy land
ing when the breakers were running in ;
but it was used for man-of-war boats also,
and it was for this place that we were
headed. The people on shore â the native
Californians and other nationalities hav
ing representatives at Monterey â all
knew, of course, what an expedition
of this sort, moving inshore with glisten
ing guns and swords, meant. General
Castro was not there. In fact there was
no Mexican force. The Mexican captain,
who had been there in the five days elaps
ing between the date of the arrival of the
Savannah in port and the appearance of
this armed force, undoubtedly nad suffi
cient time to decide what he would do.
His determination evidently was not to
engage in a conflict. Neither he nor his
soldiers made themselves manifest.
"Looking back through so many years
and, as I say, being less impressed then
with the significance of the day's work
than I have since been, lam not able to
say just what vessels were in port from my
personal recollection, but I recollect that
it was a pretty sight. Point Pinos wa9
then heavily wooded. The country was
undeveloped largely, but picturesque, and
pleased the eye. In front of us was the
white beach, beyond the rocky bluffs, and
farther on was the small adobe town, in
which the officers of first rank in the
country had made their homes. Back oX
us were the American war vessels. Yes,
it was altogether a very pretty picture,
including the broad sweep of blue water
and the Santa Cruz Mountains across the
bay.
"When the boats reached the shore most
of the population was near. Ladies and
children and the native California men,
spurs on heel, who were at home in the
saddle, looked on with curiosity as we de
barked within a stone's throw of the
custom-house. In the gathering was rep
resented the best society in this part of
the country. It did not take long to get
the sailors and marines ashore, and they !
were at once formed and marched up to
surround two sides of the custom-house â
the side toward the Santa Cruz shore and

Monterey on duly 7, 1846.
the west. The forces were arranged
in double ranks, forming two sides
nearly of a hollow square. Facing
the custom-house at the north were
a group of staff officers, among whom was
Rodman M. Price, who had been in
structed to read Commodore Sloat's
proclamation taking possession in behalf
of the United States. I stood near the
flagstaff at the north end of the custom
house, and near me was the quarter
master, who fastened the flag to the
halyards and held himself in readiness to
hoist the colors when the proper time
snould arrive.
"You can see from this that if every
thing had gone smoothly I would not
personally have raised the flag, but there
happened to be a hitch. I was given the
proper signal or order, I forget which, and
at once commanded the quartermaster:
" 'Hoist away!'
"The quartermaster pulled on the rope,
but the flag did not go up. The halyards
were stuck some way. I looked up to see
what could be the matter, but being near
the flagstaff could not make out what the
trouble was. Some officer shouted:
" 'The halyards are stuck, Toler; I'll go
up and fix it.'
"This was Midshipman Edward Higgins,
who was young like myself. He ran for
ward, and, throwing off his hat, climbed
the staff, and in a minute later shouted
'hoist away; it' a clear now.'
"In the first instance, after the quarter
master had failed I took hold myself,
being young, impatient and impetuous,
and believing that the quartarmaster was
at fault. I did not let go until I had
hoisted the flag and had fastened the hal
liards to the cleat. The Americans had
now formally taken possession of the land,
and the next to do was to provide for keep
ing a force ashore.
"With very little delay the barracks
formerly occupied by the Mexican soldiers
were occupied. The barracks consisted of
a long two-story adobe building, wuich was
not torn down until a few years ago. Here
was posted a naval force until the army
officers came and the navy gradually with
drew from shore duty. The breastworks
on the bluff above the custom-house was
found to hare three long brass cannons
in it, which the Mexicans had left there.
It was thought best to build a block house,
which was located just above the Mexican
breastwork. This was a naval fort, being
built by the navy. I commanded that fort
for a time, until I was succeeded by Mid
shipman Baldwin, since Admiral Baldwin,
who outranked . me by seniority. The
block house was known as Fort Mervine.
It was armed with three 42-pound carron
ades, which are no longer made, but were
in general use then in the navy."
Mr. Toler explained the coincidence of
his being present at the two American flag
raisings at Monterey. He spoke and wrote
Spanish fluently. When he was first ap
pointed a midshipman. Commodore Jones,
who knew Mr. Toler's father well and who
also Knew that a Spanish interpreter
would be indispensable to him on the Pa
cific Coast, at once asked the Secretary of
the Navy to assign Midshipman Toler to
his ship, and this request was granted.
As soon as Mr. Toler reported for duty he
was made aid to Commodore Jones, and
he was constantly attached to that officer
in his movements. When the flag was
first raised by order of Commodore Jones
the ceremonies, a3 they are recalled by
Mr. Toler, were substantially the same as
those arranged four years later by Com
modore Sloat. In neither instance
did the commodore go ashore. In
the episode of 1842 Captain Armstrong
commanded the landing force. The flag
was raised at the same place in 1842 and
1846. What happened to Commodore
Jones is a matter of history. He had
acted prematurely and the Government
felt constrained to put him under censure
and to give official disavowal to his wort
at Monterey, and he was accordingly re
tired for four years, which he passed at
his home by the Potomac River.
Midshipman Toler had several odd ex
periences. Some time after he was re
lieved of tne command of Fort Mervine he
was attached to Captain Mattox of tne
marines, on shore duty, largely by reason
of his ability to talk with" the Californians.
He had been promised by Commodore
Stockton, who had succeeded Commodore
Sloat, that he should have shore duty as
long as that officer remained in com
mand of the squadron. Mr. Toler enjoyed
shore life and had already made his plans
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1896.
THE UNITED STATES FRIGATTE SAVANNAH FLAGSHIP OF COMMODORE JOHN D. SLOAT.
This picture is drawn from an old sketch, and represents the Savannah just after she dropped anchor in Monterey Bay on the afternoon of July 2, 1846. It
was five days later when Commodore Sloat gave the order to have tho Stars and Stripes raised on shore.
to remain in California permanently. In
fact, he had written to his father and
sister to come to California, and had ten
dered his resignation to Commodore
Stockton, but had withdrawn the resigna
tion upon the promise of shore duty and
with the understanding that if he should
be ordered to sea he would renew his
resignation.
The navy regulations on shore do not
appear to have been strictly lived up to
at that time. One regulation of the de
partment provided that the hair should
be worn short. Midshipman Toler let
his hair grow, and out of this came an odd
enough episode.
One day Commodore Biddle sailed into
port, and soon afterward, being in com
mand of the squadron, went ashore to look
about. He soon acquainted himself with
all there was to see. When first his eyes
lighted upon Midshipman Toler's long
hair be gave a start and frowned.
"Who is that officer with long hair?" he
demanded of Captain Mattox.
The next question was, "Do you need
him very much?"
At the close of this short catechism
Commodore Biddle turned to his secretary
and ?aid, "Mr. Clark, as soon as you go on
board ship make out an order for Midship
man Toler to report at once for sea duty."
Mr. Toler at once filed a second resig
nation, which was promptly pigeonholed
by Commodore Biddle. He protested
very vigorously to Commodore Biddle, and
said that he had made all bis plans to
remain in California; that he had long
contemplated leaving the navy, but had re
mained while there was any war pro
gressing in California, and wound up by
saying that the order to send him to sea
was shameful. How be escaped a penalty
for such talk, Mr. Toler says frankly,
he does not know. The commodore was
inexorable, and in a short time Toler was
sailing for the East via Cape Horn. Com
modore Biddle added fuel to the fire by
telling the young and ardent midshipman
that the Toler family would thank him for
sending the young man home.
So it was that Mr. Toler had to resign
three times to get out of the navy. The
first resignation was offered to Commo
dore Stockton, the second to Commodore
Biddle and the third to the Secretary of
the Navy at Washington. The Secretary
was willing to accept the tnird resigna
tion, but suggested that Mr. Toler should
return to California on the frigate St.
Mary's, which was about to sail for the
Pacihc Coast, and on pay. This proposi
tion was accepted with thanks, but Mr.
Toler provided apparel in New York in
which to promptly appear as a civilian
upon his arrival at Yerba Buena. He
made the passage in an official capacity to
San Francisco or Yerba Buena.
The St. Mary's had hardly dropped
anchor when Mr. Toler went bolow. Very
soon thereafter the seamen, marines and
officers witnessed an apparition that
caused their eyes to dilate with genuine
astonishment. There was Toler walking
the deck with a fashionable street costume
of broadcloth, wearing also on his head
the highest of all high tile hats procura
ble. More than this, he affected aston
ishment conspicuously, like a regular
landsman, at the aquatic scene and mari
time surroundings about him. He walked
the deck until he came near the captain
of the ship and strode ostentatiously back
and forth in his neighborhood in all tne
pomp and circumstance of civilian attire.
The Secretary of the Navy had made his
resignation effective immediately upon
the arrival of the ship at Yerba Buena,
and he was now at one leap from the
ranks of seafarersâ a civilian.
The captain of the ship looked at
Toler in silence for awhile. Then the ears
of the latter were assailed by loud laughter.
There stood the captain too much amused
to remain quiet longer. Toler then left
the nÂ»vy and since then he has been a resi
dent of California.
Mr. Toler was born in Venezuela. His
father, who was a native of Virginia, was
at the time of his son's birth a merchant
in Venezuela. Mrs. Toler died, and the
family returned to the United States,
where Mr. Toler Sr. received an ap
pointment as Consul to Porto Rico,
which position he occupied many
years. W. P. Toler first tilled the position
of clerk to Attorney-General Crittenden.
He was appointed a midshipman through
thÂ« kind offices of Henry Clay, who, find
ing that Virginia had its full quota of ap
pointments to the navy filled, caused the
young man to be named as coming from
the State of Kentucky. The appointment
was dated in 1841, which was before the
Naval Academy at Annapolis was insti
tuted. Mr. Toier had one sister, who mar
ried Judge L. W. Hastings of California.

Unpopular Commander
11
Charles Byrnes, one of the few surviving |
members of that famous party that landed j
from the United States vessels and by j
raising the stars and stripes over the little
adobe Custom-house of Monterey secured
this glorious State to the American Na
tion, is a resident of San Francisco, having
made his home here for a number of years
past.
Though more than seventy summers
have whitened his hair, Byrnes does not
appear to be over 55 or 60, and bi3 step
and heart are still light and his memory
of the events of those stirring days re
markable. He was a sailmaker aboard
the frigate Savannah, the flagship of the
American squadron, and, being a man of
intelligence and considerable education,
saw and remembered much that wo'ild ;
have escaped the ordinary sailor. His
narrative of the stirring events that pre
ceded and followed the raising of the flag
is remarkable from the fact that many of
the incidents he relates with the minute
ness of detail that is proof of their authen
ticity have never been given to the world, !
and are now published for the firt time.
Though mauy years have passed since
Byrnes followed his vocation as a sail- I
maker afloat he has lost none of his sea
faring instincts, and every day of the year,
rain or shine, sees him on the water front
in stores where sea-captains buy their
supplies, or in other places where mari
ners congregate. Having a pension from
the United States Government for his
services during the Mexican war and
some means oi his own Byrnes is a man of
leisure and spends the largr portion of
txis time discussing matters nautical with
a few friends among the veterans of the
sea. It was while in a reminiscent mood a
few days ago that he told ot the raising of
the flag and of the narrow margin by
wnich the United States fleei prevented
the English from taking possession.
"We had a merry chase with the English
fleet all the way from Callao," he said, "and
while they never came within hailing dis
tance of us we had hardly completed the
work of raising tne flag and taking pos
session before they hove in sight off the
harbor coming under full sail, but the day
after the fair.
"We learned afterward that they were
from two to three days behind ug at each
of their stopping places, San Bias,
Mazatlan, etc, only remaining long
enough in each harbor to gain what infor
mation they could of our movements. It
transpired afterward that Admiral Sey
mour, the English commander, had orders
to seize the territory.to be held until certain
large sums owing England by Mexico were
paid. The American fleet consisted of the
Savannah ana Congress, two as fine frig
ates as ever spread a sail, and the sloops
Levant and Cyone.
"Commodore Sloat was in command,
with Commodore Stockton next in rank.
The Savannah had hardly dropped her
anchor in the blue waters of Monterey
Bay on July 2, 1846, when a boat from
shore brought the information that war
had been declared. Tne declaration was
read on the frigate's deck, after the crew
had been mustered, and then the landing
party was told off to go ashore. Five days
later this party took formal possession by
raising Old Glory.
"I remember as plainly as though it was
yesterday the line of smart boats pulling
for the shore in man-of-war styleâ single
file. Once ashore, the party was met by
the alcalde, who was an American named
Thomas 0. Larkin. He had come out to
this coast as the second mate of a whaler,
but the captain died and Larkin married
his widow and oettled ashore. Without
loss of time the party, of which I was a
member, marched to the ouatom-house,
and one of our quartermasters, named Gil
lespie, raised the flag.
"A couple of days later the English fleet
hove in sight. The stars and stripes were
plainly visible from the harbor, and
Admiral Seymour must have seen the flag
long before he came to a place where he
could anchor.
"The officers of the American vessels
were watching the English closely, and
rather expecting mischief, so that they
were not greatly surprised when tne Col
lingwood, Admiral Seymour's flagship,
hauled in between the Savannah and ConÂ«
gress.they being about three hundred yards
apart. The Collingwooa was one of those
immense 74-gua line-01-battle ships that
the English in those days were fond o
calling the 'wooden walls of England.'
She was a formidable vessel, and her tak
ing the position she did, where she coud
use every gun on the most efficient ships
of the American fleet, was looked upon as
a belligerent act that immediately caused
intense excitement aboard the Savannah
and Congress.
"Almost before she was thoroughly
moored in her position orders were given
on the Savannah and Congress to clear
decks for action. Train tackles were cast
off and overhauled, the totnpions were
taken from the guns, and within a few
moments we were in a good condition
where we could have given the Collingwood
a broadside in very short order. As soon
as the bi<: English ship was in the position
they wanted her, a boat was lowered and
Admiral Seymour came aboard of the
Savannah.
He was a tall, fine-looking man, with a
savage-lookkig scar across his forehead
and cheek, where he had received a sabe-
cut in some action.
"He saw our men at quarters as he came
up the side and glanced keenly fore and
aft, but never a word he uttered, but went
into the cabin with Sloat, where they re
mained for a considerable time. What
was said at that conference we did not
know, but at any rate the English did not
offer any opportunity to test their mettle.
The officers in command of our fleet did
not let this lull them into a state of false
security, however, but went on witn their
warlike preparations. Several 24-pounders
were landed and a blockhouse for their
accommodation built on the heights com
manding the bay. I remember well the
tremendous task we had hauling those
ponderous 'barkers' up the hillside. The
lines got so hot sometimes that we had to
pour water on them to keep them from
burning.
"At another place a strong house sur
rounded by a picket stockade was built,
with quarters for a good number of men.
A brass fieldpiece formed part of the
armament of the house.
"Sloat was a very unpopular man with
the ship's crew, principally because he
was a tyrant among the men. The cat-o'
nine-tails was his favorite sentence to
offenders and usually he failed to investi
gate the offense before ordering the un
fortunate triced up for punishment.
"I remember one incident that went a
long way to make Sloat unpopular on the
ship, and as I firmly believe led, through
the instrumentality of Commodore Stock
ton, to the abolition of flogging in the
American navy. It was a rule then, as I
suppose it is to-day, that orders must be
obeyed promptly and to some extent
blindly by the sailors of the ships. One
day we were firing a salute to some officer
or dignitary who had been aboard and was
leaving in a bout. James McLaugblin, an
old gunner 65 years old, who had been
through the Tripolitan war, was at the
port gun that was being used in the salute.
"The first lieutenant was under the after
deck, as was customary, and called out,
'Are you ready ?' McLaughlln sang out,
'No,' for he had not taken the tompion
out of his gun, but the lieutenant did not
hear him, and gave the order, 'Port fire!'
There was nothing for McLaughlin to do
but obey and he pulled the lanyard.
"The resuit was that the tompion was
sent with nearly the force of a shot and
very narrowly missed killing the officer
who was being saluted as his boat pulled
away.
"McLaughlin was called up and Sloat de
manded to know why he had fired the gun
with the tompion in.
"He explained that be had signified that
he was not ready, but the lieutenant con
tradicted him, and though there were
dozens of McLaughlin's shipmates who
would have testified that the gunner said
he was not ready to tire the gun Sloat
would hear no more, and ordered all
hands piped on deck to witness punish
ment.
"McLaughlin was given his choice be
tween apologizing to the lieutenant for
having disputed his word, or taking a
dozen lashes, and chose the latter.
"He was stripped to the waist, triced up
in the rigging and given a dozen on his
bare back that brought the blood at every
swing of the cat. Then he was cut down
and put in the brig, though before he
could be ironed there he gave the lieuten
ant a tongue-lashing that made the officer
wince, and, showing the scars he had re
ceived in the war with Tripoli demanded
to know whether it was justice that a man
who had served his country faithfully and
well should be tied up and beaten like an
animal.
"Sloat was determined that he should
apologize, however, though the lieuten
ant would have been willing to let the
matter pass. So the next two days Mc-
Laughlin was brought on deck for punish
ment and on his refusal to ask the officer's
j pardon was flogged. After the third day
I the murmurs of the crew became so deep
( that it was thought best to desist and after
being kept a few days longer in the brig
McLaughlin was released.
"The ship'a crew did not forget Sloat,
however, aSid their opportunity to revenge
McLaughlin's scars came shortly after
wa:d, when Sloat started for home around
the Horn in one of the sloops-of-war â I
i think it was the Levant.
"As was usual when so important a per
sonage was leaving, preparations were
made to show him all the honors belong
ing to his rank.
"The men were ordered to put on the I
suits that were reserved for state occa
sionsâsailors had two distinct uniforms
in those daysâ and as Sloat's boat was
pulled away toward the ship that would
taice him home, the order was given to the
men. who had previously been sent aloft
to man the rigging from the main truck to
the monkey rail, for three cheers.
"Then happened the strangest thing
that ever took (lace aboard a man-of-war.
Instead of three cheers the 600 and odd
men who made up the crew gave three
tremendous groans that could be heard a
miie.
"Only one man cheered and that was an
old cook, George Boyle by name, who had
been a favorite of Sloat's. His feeble voice
was drowned In those of the crew. Sloat
was standing up in his boat when the men
went into the rigging, but when the soi
emn groans floated across the water he sat
down abruptly and did not look toward
the Savannah again while on the way to
the Levant.
"His departure left Commodore Stockton
in command and the fleet heaved a sigh
of relief as the Levant disappeared in the
offing. Stockton was a totally different
kind of man from Sloat and was very pop
ular in the fleet, principally because he
realized that sailors were human beings
after all and should be treated as such.
He was a manly man and his qualifications
were respected by all under him. An inci
dent that happened at San Diego will
illustrate to you how he treated his men.
"He was riding along on horseback when
CHARLES ByRNES of Jhis City, Who Was Sailmaker on the
SaVannah Under Gommodore Sloat.
one of the men from the Savannah, who
had been drinking and who imagined he
had a grievance against Stockton, seized
his mount by the bridle and announced
that he could and would thrash the com
modore. In those days a man could be
hanged for striking an officer. Instead of
ordering the man on board in irons, as
Sloat would have done, Stockton tried to
pacify the man, explaining to him the
folly of picking fights and attempting to
pa3*s the affair off pleasantly. The sailor
would not be denied, however, and Stock
ton led the way to a convenient
place for a pugilistic encounter, where he
gave the sailor such a beatinp as to lineer
on his memory and visage for many days,
and then sent him aboard the ship. It
was supposed, of course, that punishment
was in order for the next day, but the
hands were never mustered for that
purpose again as long as Stockton was in
the Savannah, and the worst that befell
the sailorâ who was terror-stricken when
he sobered up and realized the position he
was inâ was a quiet admonition to be
more careful in the future.
"Stockton became a Senator from New
Jersey after retiring from the ser
vice and fathered the bill that finally
abolished flogging on board of United
States vessels.
"When the flag was raised at Monterey
it was deemed desirable to let the Ameri
cans at San Francisco, then Yerba Buena,
and particularly the commander of tne
United States sloop-of-war Portsmouth,
then lying in the bay, know of the affair as
soon as possible.
"To this end a cutter from the Savan
nah in charge of a lieutenant was dis
patched on the errand, it being thought
advisable not to send away any of the
warships at that time on account of the
presence of the Collingwood and her three
consorts.
"The Mexicans were equally desirous of
getting the news to the bay early and the
moment the flag was flying two horsemen
started overland as hard as they could go
to carry the news.
"The Savannah went to San Pedro
shortly after the affair at Monterey, and in
1848 went home. She was nearly lost in
the passage around Cane Horn, all hands
being at work for a day before she was safe.
"The last I heard of them there were
three members of the Savannah's crew be
sides myself surviving on this coast.
Josephus Munson of Santa Cruz, William
Quail of Slate Range and a man named
Walker, a boatswain of the ship who lived
at Vallejo.']
COLTON'S HALL
AT MONTEREY
A historic monument is Coiton's Hall
in Monterey. It was in that hall that
Walter Colton, the first Americau Alcalde
of Monterey, dispensed justice in the early
days of the protectorate. It was in that
hall that the first American school of the
city was taught, and it was in that hall
that the first constitutional convention of
the State of California assembled. The
last Legislature voted an appropriation to
be used in the acquirement of that ball by
the State, but the Governor's veto delayed
a consummation which is certainly to be
wished. Walter Colton was a navy chap
lain, and was appointed Alcalde by Com
modore Stockton in July, 1846, a short time
after the occupation of Monterey. The
new Alcalde's jurisdiction extended over
an immense territory and over a most
heterogeneous population. All the immi
grants, Colton declared, "have come here
with the expectation of finding little work
and less law." Through a discordant
mass he was compelled to maintain order,
punish crime and redress szrievances. The
city jail was a very weak concern, and con
finement therein was as much of a joke as
it was a punishment. Colton introduced
dignity into the Alcalde's office, and he
determined to bring about a system of law
and order, and have a governmental head
quarters into the bargain.
He decreed that prisoners confined under
his orders in Monterey would have to do
physical labor for the benefit of the town
that fed them. It was then he decided to
build a public hall, and in carrying out
that decision he gained the enmity of the
gambling element. The story of how that
hall was built is best told by John E.
Richards in his early reminiscenses of the
California bench and bar.
"Colton," says Mr. Richards, "concluded
that the town of Monterey needed a public
hall, and took this novel way of raising
the revenue to build it. Whenever he
would be informed of a faro game of any
size in progress, he would take his staff of
justice ana repair to the scene of the game.
When he thought the pile of gold on the
table large enough to suit, he would lay
hi 3 vara de justicia across the pile and
then gather it in. Out of the proceeds of
this novel form of judicial tribute, Colton
Hall, which still stands in Monterey, was
built; but Alcade Colton lost caste with
the gamblers of Monterey, and with a
lustiness worthy of our modern day they
clamored for a change."HE SAW THE.

.HISTORIC .NJIRRJITIVE OF
CJIPTJHJi SWJISEY
The J^ost Gritical period ir\ the
Turning Point of Califor
nia's History, July
7, 1846
Captain W. F. Swasey of this City was
fficially connected with the preliminaries
which led up to the occupation of Califor
nia by the Americans. He was present, in
a semi-official capacity, at the raising of
the American flag at Monterey on July 7,
184tj. His position was that of clerk to
Thomas O. Larkin, the United States Con
sul at Monterey. This enabled him to
take part in tne making of history. The
communications forwarded by Consul Lar
kin to the Department of State, then pre
sided over by James Buchanan, who sub
sequently became President of the United
States, were penned by Mr. Swasey. These
communications informed the administra
tion concerning the state of affairs and the
happenings in California, supplying the
basis for action.
Captain Swasey and W. P. Toler of
Oakland are supposed to be the only sur
vivors ot the official party who were
gathered at Monterey when Commodore
hloat's proclamation was read and the
American flag was raised. The following
account of what took place is thus told by
Mr. Swasey, the narrative embracing also
the happenings immediately preceding
the flag-raising :
"Rumors were rife of the intention of
the leading Californians to throw off the
yoke of the Mexican Government and
seek protection under the flag of some
foreign power. The dominant sentiment
among the Californians was strongly in
favor of the English Government. In the
tatter part of March or early in April,
1846, a junta, composed of the leading
Californians and citizens of alien birth,
met at the house of Mr. Larkin. Among
those attending that meeting I recall the
names of General M. G. Vallejo, Don
Pablo de la Guerra, General Jose Castro,
Don Jose Abrigo; W. E. P. Hartnell, an
Englishman, and David Spence, a Scotch
man.
"The meeting took place in a room
adjoining one occupied by me, who, being
anxious to know what was going on, lis
tened attentively to their proceedings,
from which I gathered distinctly that the
main subject of their discussion wa9 the
suggestion, or proposition, of throwing off
the trammels of the Mexican Government
and seeking protection of some foreign
flag. Several speeches were made, mostly
in farcr of England, but the meeting
finally wound up with a speech
irade by General Vallejo, the pur
port of which was that when
the time had. arrived when it should
be necessary for the well-being of the Cali
fornians to change their allegiance from
their mother country, he would be most
earnestly and emphatically in favor of ap
pealing to the United States, or, as he fre
quently termed it in his speech, 'La Grand
Republica del Norte,' upon which the
meeting broke up or adjourned without
taking definite action.
"In tne afternoon of July 2, 1846, Com
modore Sloat, on board the frigate Savan
nah, entered the bay of Monterey. The
sloops of war Levant Â»nd Cyane had been
lying there at anchor some days. The ar
rival of Commodore Sloat created a sen
sation among the Americans, ne being
flap officer of the Pacific squadron. Vague
and mysterious whisperings of trouble in
Mexico had already been circulating and
it was hoped that he was in possession of
such knowledge as would justify him in
taking decided action, especially in view
of the fact that the anti- American feeling
among the prominent Californians and
the French, including their Consul, was
acrimonious and bitter. The expected ar
rival of a large English man-of-war also
rendered the situation for the Americans
one of anxiety.
"I regard this as the most critical period
in the turning point of California's his
tory. Had Sir George Seymour arrived
before our flag was raised and entered a
protest similar to that of the French Con
sul, i Bcked, as it would have been, by the
Collingwood, a line-of-battle ship equal
in force to that of our whale squadron then
present, I venture the assertion that our
flag would not have been raised by Com
modore Sioat. It is upon record that the
English Admiral said to Commodore Sloat
on receiving him: 'Sloat, if your flag was
not flying on shore I would have hoisted
mine there.'
"The morning of Tuesday, July 7, 1846,
dawned most auspiciously. The sky
was without a cloud and the bay without
a rippie. The sun shone serenely, and all
nature seemed to have donned her love
liest garb to welcome in an event that
would be fraught with consequence of
scarcely less importance than any that
have occurred in the history of our
country during the present century.
"About 7 a. m. Captain Mervine came on
shore to make a peremptory demand for
t c surrender of the town. By 9 most of
the inhabitants of the village had gath
ered near the custom-house, watching the
boats assembled about the ships leaded
with men and arms. When the order
%va- triven and they advanced to the shore,
preserving perfect alignment, it was a
magnificent sight that no American preÃ
ent will ever forget.
"On landing the marines immediately
surrounded the custom-house and flag
staff. Midshipman W. P. ToJer was the
officer selected to hoist the flag. As the
jriorious flag gracefully rose and the gentle
breeze revealed its lustrous stars and
luminous stripes, amid the booming of
cannon and strains of martial music 1
turned to look into the faces of my Ameri
can friends and found their eyes were as
dim as my own."
Captain Swasey, after an adventurous
career as trader, merchant, hunter and
trapper, arrived in California, overland,
at Sinters Fort, September 23 1545. He
remained for a time in a clerical position
a' the fort and then came to San Fran
cisco (then Yerba Buena), and here ne
met Captain Fremont, who was on his
way to Monterey to obtain permission
from General Castro to take his whole
party to Monterey, to obtain supplies and
clothing. Early in March Captain
Swasey, having obtained an appointment
as consular secretary to Consul Larkin,
started for Monterey. Arriving at San
Jose, he was selected, at a meeting of
Americans, to go as a courier to Fremont,
news having been received that the latter
was surrounded by Mexicans at Gavilan
Peak.
Before he reached Fremont Captain
Swasey was taken before General Castro

and presented his letter to Consul Larkin
to show that he was going only to Monte
rey to act as consuiar secretary, and that
Julius Martin, who accompanied him, was
pointing out the way. He finally reached
Fremont's camp, the fires of which were
still smoldering. Fremont had gone

tinued to Monterey and assumed the duties
of consular secretary. Later he became
assistant commissary on Fremont's staff.
He is the only surviving officer of that staff.
He was the first Marshal of the Territory
of California. He was successively secre
retary of the Town Council of San Fran

A little way north of Cozumel and about
five miles from the coast of Yucatan is
Isla de Mujeres (Woman s Island), a tiny
spec* in the Caribbean Sea, only Bix mileÃ

to assert that more astonishing things are
crowded upon it, suggestions of strange,

found in any other place of equal size.

Fannie B. Ward in the Chicago Inter-
Ocean. Charney and Stephens and Le
Plongeon and Ober have written all about
it, so I will not add my poor mite to their
extended researches. We turned our
camera upon the remarkable ruins at the
northern end and picked up a few broken
bits of idols, which will be cherished as
sacredly as by their ancient worshipers.
Near the shore were immense flocks of
sea birds on the piles of a turtle inclosnre
and overhead hovered a cloud of white
ibises. All along the beach were strewn
the rotting carcasses of turtles, covered
with swarms of flies and actually heaving
with corruption.
Another excursion led us inland from
Merida to the village of Tixkokob. The
town does not amount to much, but it has
a fine old church, back of which is the
quaintest cemetery I have ever seen. All
around its outer walls rows of skulls are
ranged; skulls grin along the arras of
every cross, with which the interior is
tliickly set, and several huge vases are
piled high with the same ghastly relics.
In the middle is a promiscuous heap of
human bones several feet deep. Inside
the walls, dangling by cords fastened to
the top, are baskets and boxes and bundles,
each containing a skeleton, appropriately
labeled. Everywhere are fragments of
shrouds, shoes that have dropped from
fleshless feet, arm?, legs, and trunks to
which dried flesh still adheres, and scores
of skulls with hair clinging to themâ some
the long beautiful tresses of women.

The reason that certain animals lap in
stead of drink seems to be an arrangement
of nature to prevent carnivorous animals,
whose stomachs are comparatively small,
from over : distending themselves with
water. Most of the animals tfiat suck when
drinking are herbivorous and nave large
stomachs, or more than one, with a paunch
or receptacle for unchewed food, and with
them digestion is a slow process and there
is little if any danger of overdistension,
although such a thing is not unknown
with some domestic herbivorous animals.
Digestion is a much more rapid process
with the carnivora, and it is important
that it should not be delayed by the inges
tion of large quantities of cold water. By
lapping the mouth and throat are thor
oughly moistened, while the water is sup
plied to the stomach in small quantities,
properly warmed and mixed with saliva.
It may be fairly assumed that the carni-

herbivorous animals are their food, and
that therefore lapping may be considered
a more highly developed way of drinking
than sucking. â Pittsburg Dispatch.
A PROTESTANT
MISSIONARY
JW. S. H. Willey Was
the First Or\e to
Lar\d
T.HE GUEST OF GOVERNOR
BEJMETT RILEY
He Had to J^ake ji\s OWn Jables
and Ghairs as J^ere
Was No One to
Labor
The first American missionary to set
foot in Monterey was Rev. S. H. Willey,
who, for the past seven years, has been
president of the Van Ness Seminary in
this City. The first steamship that ever
came up the coast, the California, landed
him in what was then the capital of the
Territory on February 23, 1849. The first
Protestant services in Monterey were held
in a parlor of the house occupied by Gov
ernor Bennett Riley, and subsequently
services were held in the Governor's busi
ness office.
"Monterey," said the venerable clergy
man, "was a city which im Dressed me with
its distinctively Mexican character. I
found the people very cordial, and, al
though I was a stranger to the. Spanish,
tongue when I arrived, I got along admir
ably well. The fact is that Monterey's
population, early in 1849, was composed
chiefly of women and children. The rea
son for this state of affairs was that every
man who could buy, beg or borrow a mule
| had gone to the mines, for the gold excite
ment was then at its height. There was
not a man in Monterey to do any labor,
and, as there was no furniture for sale in
town, I was in a curious predicament.
However, by chance I discovered in Col
ton's Hall a kit of tools that had been left
behind by 'their owner, who was on the
road to the goldrields. With the tools I
â  made a table and a bench and a couple o!
i stools, and thus furnished up a room at
small expense.
"I nad the honor to be the chaplain of
the first State constitutional convention
of California, which met in Colton's Hall,
Monterey, September 1, 1849. During my
j first six months in Monterey I preached
; to the soldiers on Sunday and taught
I school during the week. I gathered about
| sixty children around me in Colton's Hall
I and taught them how to speak English.
j This was not a simple task, by any means,
I for I knew not a word of Spanish and my
| pupils coula not speak a syllable of Eng
'â  lish. I used a blackboard, however, and
conveyed my meaning largely by illustra
tion. In the parade at the approaching
I celebration of the flag-raising anniversary
in Monterey the marshal, I understand,
will be a Mr. Leese. He was a little pupil
of mine in 1849 and well do I remember
how I taught him to speak English."
Rev. Mr. Willey has arrived at the good
old age of 74. He is a native of New
Hampshire, a graduate of Dartmouth Col
lege, the alma mater of Daniel Webster,
and came on his Western mission fresh
from the Union Theological Seminary in
New York. His name is indelibly associ
ated, it should be added, with the found
ing of our own University of California.
"I am as proud of California as if she
were a child of mine," said Mr. Willey,
smiling. "I have watched her grow from,
her infancy, from seed to fruit. In 1849, a
pupil of my school brought me an apple
from the Mission. It was such a rare
thing that I prized the gift 'and carried it
home with me. It was so good to look at
that I couldn't bear to eat it. To-day the
whole land is rich with fruitage."
The Rev. Mr. Willey carries a wealth of
California history under his frosty locks.
He is honored and respected far and wide.

The rage for novelty in Sunday litera
ture and illustration having led somebody
to picture to a deeply concerned and thor
oughly interested world the comparative
size of a structure that should contain as
much room -as all the houses in the City
put together, a member of The Call staff
has contributed a chapter of up-to-date
-: -dilations that will be found far in ad
vance of anything of the kind previously
attempted. It is confidently expected that
this article will go a long way toward fill
ing a "long-felt want" of something new,
hitherto undreamed of, and gloriously
impossible.
If the people of San Francisco consume |
300,000 pounds of beef a day, what a mam
moth creature would be the steer or the
heifer which would represent in size and
weight the grand aggregate of all the
beeves slain on the altar of this com
munity's appetite for one whole year! It
would, of course, be a couple of hundred
thousand times the size and weight of the
ordinary ateer, and if the sun's rays fell
directly on it from above the body would
throw a shadow that would cover forty
times the area occupied by the Palace
Hotel. If the animal could be kept still
long enouph all the military companies of
the City could parade and maneuver on
the plateau of its back. The creature
would require about 10,000 tons of hay as
its daily food, and its board would cost
about $700,000 a week.
It will be next m order for some bril
liant mind to obtain from all the cities of
the land wherein the electric lipht is in
use reliable information as to the total
number of lights in use and their respect
ive candle-power. The aggregate candle
power of all the electric lights in use may
then be obtained, and the reader will be
dumfounded with the information that
if the total candle-power of all those elec
tric lights were combined in one, and that
one immense light hoisted up to an alti
tude that would put it alongside the moon
when that orb is in mid-heaven, the silvery
disk would fade out of the unequal contest
with twentieth century science, even as it
melts away before the radiant eye of the
morning.
In fact, it will possibly be shown that
were all the electric candle-power in the '
world, and all the power that can be gen

one sublime light, and that light raised a

ENGLISH PROVES BETTER
THAN MOOTHER TONGUE
The population of Chinatown progresses
steadily and some of the tan-colored
youth up there are fin de siecle decidedly.
Yesterday afternoon, at the junction of |
Stockton and Clay streets, there were
fathered three or four young Chinamen
whose attention was riveted on a moving
tableau on the southwest corner of the
two streets named. The tableau embraced
two Chinese girls done in "fast colors,"
opulent in jade stone rings and gewgaws,
rigid as to deftly plastered hair, roseate as
to lips painted an unnatural and vivid red,
and as white as a miller's coat with some '
sort of dust liberally put on to make a pale
background of cheek for the flares and
splashes of red conspicuous on their small
facial area.
The Chinese youth discussed them
freely from their head ornaments to their
milk-white hose and funny little, vivid
sreen bottines or slippers. But the Chi
nese language was discarded and the talk
went on in English, to the amusement of
Eastern tourists and other bystanders.
"She's my girl," said one in English
without a Chinese inflection.
"Oh, no," said another, "she's mine."
The conversation wa3 of this sort all
through and it was all in English, spoken
with a San Francisco accent throughout.
THE SCARCITY OF
CHENESE INTERPRETERS
While there are now quite a number of
white men in San Francisco who are able
to converse in the Chinese language with
the Chinese merchants it is a singular fact
that there are only three or four who are
able to act as court interpreters. The
Chinese lan uage has been spoken in San
Francisco nearly half a century and dur
ing two score years the local Chinese popu
lation has numbered thousands continu
ously. These conditions would naturally
suggest that there would be scores of Chi
nese interpreters competent to go into
court, but such is not the fact. Mr.
Millard, who has been an interpreter
many years, says that part of this is due
tp the fact that the Sam Yups and See
Yups employ totally different words to ex
press the same idea or to describe the
same object. For instance one branch of
the Chinese speakwig people here call an
association a "bong" while the other
branch calls it a "tone." The technical
names are very hard to acquire in both
the Sam Yup and See Yup dialects, espe
cially names of medicines and drugs,
names and varieties of fabrics of differing
kinds. Many persons have tried to become
interpreters, bat few white persons nave
kept on. Mr. Millard picked up the two
dialects himself without the aid of rules
of constiuction, which are now better
understood by white persons interested in
philology than they were formerly.
MOCK FLOWERS OUT
OF REAL BLOSSOMS
The park gardeners have devised and
are executing something new in the way
of floral designs for the ornamentation of
the people's play-ground. Heretofore the
slopes around Conservatory Valley have
been decorated with geometrical figures
very lareely, these being done in vari
colored foliage plants. The odd and pleas
j ing fancy suggested itself of making mock
i flowers by the same means. So the slopes
; are now becoming interesting with mimic
plants of size sufficiently laree to fit them
for prize-winners in the land of Brobdis
! nag. Some plants with green foliage are
: used to make up the outlines of the stem,
these stems being fully ten or twelve feet
long. From these stems radiate smaller
stems on which the mock flowers appear,
the petals being outlined by flowers of
small leaf adapted for the purpose of indi
cating tne proper segregation. These
! strange but interesting productions at
tract the undivided attention of those who
see them the first time. Tne work has
1 been progressing during the past week.
The mock flowers appear to have an aver
age diameter of three feet at least and the
mock leaves are on the same large and
generous scale.
Recently Discovered Portrait of Washington.
Officers in the English navy were dis
tinguished by no particular dress from
those in the army till the time of George 11.
In Wales and Cornwall many of the

cNe^? Picture of Washington
I JKe Or\ly LiVirxg Descendant of tke Father
of His Govmtry
Collectors of Washingtoniana will be in
terested to learn that a hitherto unknown
engraving of the Father of His Country
has recently been discovered. It is not
mentioned in W. 8. Baker's "Engraved
Portraits of Washington," wnich is the
standard work on the subject. But Mr.
Baker has recognized it as a valuable ad
dendum to the contemporary portraits of
our first President.
The engraving in question, according to
the legend thereon, was "Pubd. 15th July,
1784, by Whitworth & Yates, Birming
ham." These English engravers are well
known as the publishers of other valuable
Drints of the same subject. It shows
Washington in his early manhood and
differs considerably from the more fa
miliar portraits which limn him at a ma
ture age. The discoverer is a gentleman
who purchased half a dozen impres
sions, belonsine to a farmer in the
West. The Western gentleman explained
that they had been in his family for gen
erations, but could give no further infor
mation. He was not aware of the rarity
of his property.
One of the closest relatives of the
"Father of His Country" is selling cigars
at a stand in the Pension I Office m Wash
ington, D. C. He resembles remarkably
his distinguished ancestor.
Visitors to the Pension Bureau see in the
center of the. building a small stand,
behind wnich is a man whose face bears a
wonderful resemblance to the familiar
portraits of Washington. He is Colonel
Ebenezer Burgess Ball, one of Washing
ton's nearest of kin and related to him
through several different lines of ancestry.
Colonel Ball is one of four people who
claim eaually near kinship of Washing
ton. The grandfather of the present
Colonel Ebenezer Burgess Ball was a
Colonel Ball who served in tne Revolu
tionary army. He was a near relative to
Mary Ball, General Washington's mother.
The Colonial Colonel Ball and Washing
ton were cousins, both being grandchil
dren of a Ball. This Colonial Colonel Ball
married Frances Washington, a niece of
Washington, so that the present Colonel
Ebenezer Ball is doubly related to the
father of his country. There are four di
rect, living descendants of the marriage of
Frances Washington and Colonel Ball â
Mrs. Kittie Middleton of Loudon County,
Washington Ball, Colonel Ebenezer Bur
gess Ball and his sister, who is an aged
invalid in the Home for Incurables.
Colonel Ebenezer Bn rgess Ball was born
in Loudon County, Va., in 1817, and came
to Washington when 17 years of age to
work in a store which stood on the coiner
of Seventh street and Pennsylvania avenue.
He went West and settled on the Osage
River in Missouri, but when the gold fever
broke out in California he fitted out five
ox-wagons and started for the rich fields of
the Pacific Coast. But he never reached
â hem, going instead to the wilds of the
then unknown State ot Oregon. The val
ley of the Rogue River was settled by
| miners, and the Indians of that locality
i made a savage war on them, capturing
i their wagons and leaving the drivers dead
and scalped on the fields. Colonel Ball
fought during the war, and afier It waa
ended went into the provision business,
taking supplies from camp to camp.
At the commencement of the Civil War
he returned to his old home at Leesburg,
Va., and remained there to care for his
aged mother, assuming the charge of the
fine home plantation. The close of hostili
ties found him a ruined man. He then
came to Washington and engaged In the
butter business, but could not make it pay.
When the Washington monument wag
completed Colonel Ball applied for the
post of custodian, but it was denied him.
He has since supported himself by selling
cigars to the clerks in the Pension Office.
He is unmarried, quiet, polished and
courtly of manner and very proud of his
family history.

It was a great day, but everybody is glad
it is over.
Stay at home to-day and ?ee Monterey
to-morrow.
This ia a day of rest for the righteous,
but not for Chicago.
Chicago may sweat but the country
won't. The day of anxiety is past.
The more the Democratic convention
takes shape the worse shape it gets into.
The two-thirds rule is in danger of col
lapsing, along with other Democratic doc
trines.
So far as Cleveland is concerned this is
the most thorough outing season on
record.
Commodore Sloat may not have been
very vigorous about the dag-raising, but he
raised it.
The party that tries to dodge the tariff
issue in this campaign will have to dodge
the people.
If Monterey has any Chicago enterprise
she will take a census this week and count
everybody in.
The Call will give you news from Chi
cago impartially and fairly, and that is the
news you wish.
â¢Wnat I want is to see idle men at work
at American wages," says McKinley, pnd
so do we all of us.
Whitney, Hill, Gorman and all their fol
lowers must either bolt, crawl or lie down
and be walked on.
They will not turn Grover's picture to
the wall in Chicago but tear down the wall
it was hanging on.
The Democratic convention will be more
lite a mass-meeting in a silver mining
camp than anything else.
Chicago weather will go as far toward
demoralizing the convention as a gold bolt
or an Altgeld domination.
Make up your mind to vote for protection
and prosperity, and the rest of the cam
paign won't bother you much.
There are some men in the world who
will say anything, and consequently there
are some who say they like Altgeld.
You can count on better times after the
election, so you may as well take a good
holiday this summer and get ready for
business.
The Santa Cruz festival recreated the
State during the St. Louis convention, and
now Monterey will do the same good turn
for us during the Chicago racket.
Some of the stalwart Democrats at
Chicago seem? inclined to throw Teller
into the nomination in about the same
way they would throw a cat in a well.
It is asserted by the Chicago Record that
pianos can be reiitea in that city cheaper
than typewriting machines, but, all the
Mime, that is no municipal improvement.
As the latest Eastern cyclone struck a
picnic party in New York instead of an
Altgeld caucus in Chicago, the belief will
be strengthened that their activity is
wholly pernicious.
Fortunately for Californian?, they can
always find a cool place in which to sit and
read about what the Democrats, the Popu
lists, the Free Pilverites and the anarchists
are doing in Chioago.
Yale hasn't very good prospects for win
ning in the Thames races, but all the
same she may do it. Americans have
many a time won by piuck, skill and
energy when the prospects were against
them.
The California headquarters at Chicago
ought to display conspicuously three times
a day the weather record of San Francisco,
so as to show the sweating delegates what
they missed by not holding the convention
in this City.
It is now asserted that the French
claimed a protectorate over Madagascar as
far back as the days of Richelieu, but
while this may be accepted by the Euro
pean as a precedent the average Ameri
can is more likely to bar it out as a
chestnut,

The Boston Herald says: "There are a
few favored parts of the world, such, for
example, as California, \\ here, with rare
exceptions, the rain can be counted on at
a certain season of the year and at other
seasons there is the same assurance of
fair and dry weather, so that the results
of agriculture become almost as exact as
a geometrical problem." That's right,
young man. Come West and grow up
with the climate.
"MONEY OF THE CONSTITUTION."
Immediately upon bis arrival in Chi
cago Senator Stewart of Nevada began to
innate the Teller balloon with a mixture of
wind and gas composed of the Nevada
Senator's pet catchword, "Gold and silver
the money of the constitution." But
Senator Stewart is not the only one who
talks much about the "money of the con
stitution." It has been the war-cry of the
advocates of free-silver coinage from the
start, ana not a few defenders of the gold
standard try to prove that gold is the
money of the constitution. It is fortu
nate, perhaps, that the yontu of the coun
try are too busy attending to their school
books to become acquainted with the
ignorance and stupidity of some of the
Nation's alleged wise men.
In every school where the pupils are re
quired to read and listen to lectures upon
the constitution of the United States it is
perfectly well known that there is no such
thing as "gold and silver, the money of
the constitution." Nodoubtagood many
school children wonder where Senators
and other supposedly great statesmen got
their information when they descant so
learnedly upon the "gold and silver" of
tha constitution, for nowhere in the docu
ment that is in the hands of the public is
anything ol" the kind to be found. Net a
very great while ago a member of Con
gress offered to bet something worth while
that not 75 per cent of the members in re
cent years had ever read the constitution
and that not 10 per cent would know if it
were being quoted correctly or not. Uut
however that may be it is apparent that
Chicago is just now entertaining a good
many alleged economists and statesmen
who are ignorant of what the constitution
really provides for concerning money.
The only reference in the constitution
to the power of the Government to issue
money is in section Bof article I, which
says "the Congress shall bave power to
coin money, regulate the value thereof
and of foreign coin." It appears that the
framers of the instrument were suspicious
that some State might conclude to go
into the money-manufacturing business,
and to prevent anything of that sort sec
tion 10 was made to say that "no State
shall make anything but gold and silver
coin a tender in the payment of debts."
Thus it will be seen the constitution does
not name what material money shall be
corr.Dosed of, only that it shall be some
thing that can be coined. The constitu
tion leaves the question of what metal
shall be used to coin into money entirely
with Congress. If this were not so the
act of IST3, which demonetized silver,
would have been unconstitutional, and
when one talks about retuonetizing he ad
mits the demonetization was constitu
tional, else there would be nothing to re
monetize.
It is very clear that the States were re
stricted to gold and silver as legal tender
money to prevent tbem from issuing iiat
paper money, but it must be remembered
thut the constitution does not oblige Con
gress to conform to the decree concerning
the States. It will be observed also that
the Government, in reserving to itself the
sole right to coin money, obliges the States
to accept its coins for tender in payment
of debt? only when they are gold or silver
coins. No doubt the framers of the con
stitution bad in mind the possibility of
conditions which Congress should be left
free to meet, and hence they left the whole
question of what meuil or metals should
be coined with Congress, to be determined
from time to time as occasion might re
quire. It follows, therefore, that the ques
tion of what shall ana what shall not be
coined into money is a matter of policy
and not of principle, and that the consti
tution has nothing whatever to do with it
except to see that the power is not taken
away from Congress "to coin money, reg
ulate the value thereof and of foreign
coins."
NEWS FROM CHICAGO.
True to its policy of giving impartial
reports of all events, The Call has ar
ranged for a news service from the Chicago
convention which will be in the highest
degree gratifying to all who wish fair re
ports of both sides in the great contro
versy between the silver and the gold
factions of the Democratic party.
No men are better known or are more
highly esteemed among Democratic lead
ers on this coast than the Hon. John P.
Irish and the Hon. James G. Maguire.
One is a leader of the gold men and the
other of the silver men. Both will act as
correspondents of The Call from Chicago.
It cannot be doubted that each of these
men will have inside information of all
that goes on. Therefore, in giving their
reports to the public, The Call has the
assurance that it will give the most accu
rate account of the various moves made
by the leaders at Chicago of any paper
on the Pacific Coast if not in the entire
Union.
Of course The Call will not rely for its
news wholly upon Judge Maguire and Mr.
Irish. In addition to their contributions
we shall receive full reports from the
United Press, which does not deal in fakes,
and also special reports from such trained
journalists as Carleton, Frank McGuire
and John Paul Cosgrave. We shall also
have special artists at the convention to
depict its dramatic scenes and furnish
portraits of its leading men. By reason of
this force we will be able to give a clear
and comprehensive report of all the pro
ceedings of the rival parties, while from
Mr. Irish and Judge Maguire we will get
the viewt of party leaders on the signifi
cance of each event
The aim of The Call will be to give the
news as briefly as it can be eiven without
omitting anything of interest, and with
out reporting one side to the exclusion of
the other. We intend to speak for all.
Our columns wiii deal impartially between
the various factions. We shall give the
whole news with no fakes and no padding;
and above all no straining after sensations
or flippant and extravagant exaggerations
of what is said and done. Read This Call
and you will get all the news, ana, in
addition thereto, a daily review of events
from James G. Maguire and John P. Irish.
FREE COINAGE OF MUSCLE.
The London (England) Chronicle is not
at ease because it cannot understand,
among other American sayings, the mean
ing of "the free coinage of muscle.' The
expression is American, wholly so, and if
its meaning is a mystery to the esteemed
Chronicle, we beg to assure our contempo
rary that it is a very plain and simple
proposition in this country. To Ameri
cans "the free coinage of muscle" means
unobstructed opportunity to employ one's
muscle in honorable occupation at highly
remunerative wages.
For three years American workingmen
have had very littlw opportunity to coin
their skill and labor into dollars. Labor
has been ''demonetized" so far as it repre
sents unearned money is concerned. And
what "free coinage pi labor means" just
now is that America,?" industrial enter
prises are to be started up again and labor
is to be given a chance to coin itself Into
good dollars. No douLi England will have
a better understanding of the meaning of
"The free coinage of American labor"
when she finds that our workingmen are
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1896.
supplying us with all the manufactured
articles we want forourown consumption,
and a little more, and that we shall not
have to longer call upon the factories of
England for anything. The esteemed
Chronicle will thm have a continuous ob
ject lesson in the practical operation of the
economic law of the free coinage of work.
About $70,000,000,000 are divided up
among the people of the United States and
practically every dollar of it is the result
of the strict application of the principles
of the free coinage of American brain,
Drawn and industry. As we have said, the
coinage works have not been running much
for about three years and consequently
not a great deal of muscle has been con
verted into dollars, but the mints of in
dustry will be in full operation by and by
when every wage-earner in the country
will be free to deposit his labor and carry
â¢way it; equivalent in gold, silver, green
backs, treasury notes, coin certificates or
National bank notes. Then we shall bave
free and unlimited coinage of American
labor without asking the co-operation or
permission of any country on earth.
THE MONTEREY FESTIVAL.
The celebration to take place at Monte
rey tins week will be something of a
patriotic observance like the commemora
tion of the Fourth of July, and something
of a festival Hke those which have now be
come bo marked a feature of California
life. Its patriotic significance will be most
prominent in the public mind and will be
emphasized in every feature of the pro
gramme. It is to be a festival in honor of
the raisine of the starry flag above the soil
of California â an act which virtually made
this land a part of the Union and estab
lished it as a possession of the American
people forever.
In the course of the celebration tbere
will be much said in honor of Commodore
Sloat, who commanded the American
squadron in the bay at the time the llap
wa9 raised, and this will probably cause
some criticism from those who regard the
old commodore as one who had greatness
thrust upon him rather than achieved it.
"We need not take part in this controversy.
It is sufficient for us that the flag was
raised and it is sullicient for float's fame
that he was in command at the time it
was done.
The greatness which came to the com
modore was no mere accident of fortune
like that which befell Marshall when he
discovered gold. Sloat had served his
country long and had risen to high rank
before time, chance and circumstance gave
him the high honor of virtually annexing
California to th c United States, and mak
ing this an ocean girt republic. There
fore he is not unjustly entitled to the
honors accorded him, and rnauy a hero
has a less-merited monument than that
which is to be raised to him.
The arrangements made for the celebra
tion at Monterey are most appropriate for
the occasion, and ara to be carried out on
a scale that could hardly be expected of a
community of that size. Monterey, how
ever, has tbe true California spirit and
does things without counting the cost.
This is to be the celebration of a great
event in her history, and her people in
tend to make it famous throughout the
whole extent of the country. It is to be,
moreover, something more than a local

THE FRUITS OF YESTERDAY.
It is not paradoxical nor is it a contra
diction to say tnat patriotism needs to be
fertilized, watered and cultivated. Patriot
ism is really a virtue, but the good of it,
in contradistinction to its antipodes, po
litically and ethically speaking, lies in its
steady growth and in its fruitage mean
while. A heart here and there abounding
in patriotism is not enough to sustain the
weight of such a Government as ours. It
must be widely diffused and overlap every
where. A soldier who was severely
wounded in one of the battles of the War
of the Rebellion was ordered to the rear
by his commanding officer. After a little
while he returned and asked for a gun.
saying "there is no rear to this battle."
There is no "rear" in the battle of duty,
but there are spots of inactivity between
the lines which too many seek.
It is quite safe to say that the awaken
ing to duty which the Fourth of July
causes from hamlet to metropolis is the
strength of that vigilance which is the
price of liberty. It comes, too, as the
timely shower comes to the fieldâ not
neglected wholly â but which has been
passed by in the pursuit of harvests else
where. The heart of the American citizen
is in the right place, but poison weeds of
â¢elhshness. which bud into forgetfulness of
the source of the right to come and go and
to plant and reap for one's own good,
would suffocate the Heart's love of liberty
but for the strength which aroused patriot
ism imparts.
Therefore it is pleasing to note that
there was an outpouring of the people
yesterday in every community in the
United States to revive, fertilize and cul.
tivate the wide field of individual patriot
ism. It was a day set apart for that pur
pose, and the universal participation in
the joy it offered and the satisfaction that
every one felt at renewing his allegiance
to the spirit and the purpose of their
Declaration of Independence will all be
resolved into a mighty oneness with hith
erto accumulating purpose to perpetuate
the principles of individual sovereignty,
which is the glory of American manhood.
AGGRESSIVE JAPAN.
Our political economists see danger
ahead for the industries of the United
States in Japan's wonderful strides in com
mercial expansion. A decade ago the en
tire export and import trade of Japan
amounted to only 178,0OlÂ»,000, but this year
it will amount to considerably over $300,
-000,000, and includes nearly all arti
cles of manufacture. The item of
textile goods alone has increased from
$500,000 ten yean ago and reached over
$23,000,000 in 1595. But Japan can afford to
launch out and attack the commerce of the
older nations in their strongholds. Labor
is not a very great item of coat in turning
out goods and wares. The factories are
pretty generally equipped with modern
machinery, and Japanese workmen are
quick to learn how to manage it. In textile
and other mills wnere children can be
employed they are given service at wages
equivalent to from one to two rents for a
day of twelve hours, and now that a
Japanese company is preparing to operate
a line of steamers between their country
and the United States we may expect to
have ample opportunity to inspect the
output of Japan's industrial enterprises I
in our own markets in the near future,
unless they are taxed to where it would
not be profitable to offer them for sale.
But there is a feature of Japan's aggres
siveness which we appear to overlook in
our wonder at Her commercial audacity,
and in this she is heartily seconded by
China. We refer to the work that Is being:
done to give Buddhism a strong foothold
in America. In their enthusiastic effort to
put their goods Into our own markets the
Japanese would like very much to see
their religious faith keep pace with their
commercial advanoement. And, strange aa
it may appear, the work of spreading
Buadhlsm in this country is wholly, we
might say, in the hands of American con
verts. There are considerably over 100
organized Buddhist societies in the
United States, and each one is more or less
a propaganda. They do not call them
selves Buddhists, but the gospel of "Lord
Buddha" is the basis of their faith, and
they have all the enthusiasm of the new
convert.
Their hope is to see Buddhism triumph
over every other system of religion, and
to that end they are working in wonderful
harmony. That they are sincere there is
no doubt whatever, and the steady growth
of the work is giving them great encour
agement. They are in communication with
Buddhist priests in the Orient who trans
late the doctrine of Buddha into English
for free distribution in this country, and
they are always prepared to give the rea
son of their faith in public and in private.
As yet the effort to convert this country
to Buddhism is little more than in the
earlier stages of missionary work, but if
zeal and honesty of purpose and mone3 r
count for anything, it may be that Chris
tian missionaries who are now wrestling
with Buddhism in the Orient may have to
return to undo wbat is being dove to sup
plant Christianity at their own homes.
Verily, Japan is aggressive in more ways
than one.

PRETTY BICYCLE COSTUME FOR
GIRLS.
Girls who do not approve of bloomers find
the rather short skirt the ideal garment. It is
becoming off the wheel as well, and is graceful
and really more modest than the longer skirts
which are narrow enough not to catch in the
wheel, for these latter cling and show the out
line of the form very plainly. The skirt, if
properly made, never annoys one by blowing.
To insure this the fabric must have some body
to begin with, and It must further bo faced
up about five inches with the goods. The
neatest finish for this if small rows of stitch
ing. If the goods is not heavy an interlining
of canvas may be used between lacing and
skirt. The skirt should be lined with satine,
to insure a freedom of movement that is im
possible with woolen goods. The knickers
mar be made of the satine for summer wear,
and then a skirt lining is not necessary. The
lexgin.4 should match the costume or the
facing. A cheviot of mixed tone is very jaunty
with leather facing: and leggins. A band of
leather is put on the hat also, and the gloves
and buttons should be of the color of the
leather.
The skirt bu a front gore and from that is
seamless to the center back, where one pleat
la laid on either side.
The skirt buttons at the top of the front. The
top fits perfectly smooth without darts, as it is
cut circular at the side* and back. The waist
lits smoothly over the hips and is cut with the
back and side forms in one. A plain cioth,
black or brown, looks exceedingly well with
white cuffs and collar.
This skirt is appropriate to wear with shirt
waist* for the summer.
Ttil* costume shows three patterns.
The jacket is No. 7640 and is cut in sizes
from lv to 16 year*.
The skirt is No. 7814 and is cut in sizes from
10 to ltt yean.
The knickers and leggins are No. 7842 and
cut in same sices as skirt.
For the entire Costume, six yards of 44-inch
good* is sufficient, with a yard and three
quarters of satine for knickers.

they have as far south as Uerenda, why can't
they extend it still farther south? There is no
reason for it except that they are not forced to

I dreamed this dream: In the land above
A plan was laid for t tie public waal.
'Ibm a plan conceived in a matchless love,
And the samta upbeld it with fervor and zeal.
The angels went living b.nh-tiltber and fro,
>or they looked on the plan and knew it was
gOOd,
And in visions they saw it still constantly grow,
Aa a plan that Is excellent certainly should.
There came a time when the scheme went wrong;
There came a hitch In the thing they'd do;
Theie came a pause to the mighty throne.
And something bad happened Saint Peter
knew.
'â Oh, what 1b there wrong? 1 ' he whispered In fear,
And a cherub replied with a shrug or two;
"Why, some of those l'resnaus have got in here
And enjoined the proceedings, aa Kresncns do.',
It was only a dream, and I'm glad to feel,
As I hope for bliss on the other side,
That the thing I saw can never he real,
A conclusion that hardly can be denied.
And should you as* why my faith is great
That heaven is never injunction-accursed.
The answer is plain, and I tell you straight,
Tlio brood of en joiners must get there n'rst.

"â ucb a man as Pinkerton, the detective."
His name was Allan Pinkerton, born in the
Gorbals, Glasgow, Scotland, August 25, 1819.
fli* father was a sergeant of the police force of
Glasgow. He learned the cooper's trade, mar
ried Joan Carfrae of Edinburgh, Scotland, and

first detective work was the running ,down,?
a gang of counterfeiters on Bogus Island, 111.
In recognition of this service he was made

President of the United States, after declaring
how the electors shall vote by ballot for Presi
dent and Vice-President and how their ballots
shall be sent to the seat of Government di
rected to the President of the Senate, it says :
"The President of the Senate sha.'. , in the
presence of the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives, open all the certificates and tbe
votes shall then be counted, the person having
the greatest number of votes for President,
shall be the- President, if ench number be a
majority of the whole number of elector* ap
pointed; and if no person have such majority,
then from the persons having the highest num
ber, not exceeding three on the list of
those voted for as President, the House of Rep
resentatives shall choose immediately by ballot
the President. But in choosing the President
the votes shaH be taken by States, the repre
sentation from each State having one vote; a
quorum for this purpose shall consist of a
member or members irom two-thirds of the
fctates, and a majority of all the States shall be
necessary to a choice. And If the House of
Representatives shall not choose a President
whenever the right of choice shall devolve
upon them before the 4th day of March next
following then the Vice-President shall act as
President." If Congress had passed laws ex
actly prescribing the method of verification of
the votes of electors for President and Vice-
President the operation of countine would
have been merely mechanical. On February
3, 1887, the Pr sident approved an act o"f
Congress governing the electoral count.
Its provisions require the electors to
meet in their respective Sta'.es on the
second Monday in January following their
election and to cast their votes. Any contest
regarding their election must be decided at
least six days before, as provided by the State
laws. Three lists of the electors, certified to
by the executive of tbe State, are to be pre
pared and to be handed to the electors, to ac
company their list of votes. Congress is to be
in session on the second Wednesday in Feb
ruary to be present at the opening of the cer
tificates. Objections to the reception of a re
turn must be in writing, signed by one mem
ber of each House. Where objection is made
to the only lawful return of a State, that re
turn can be rejected only by the concurrent
vote of both Houses. If there was no contest
within the State, and two or more returns are
received, that signed by the executive shall be
counted unless rejected by the concurrent vote
of both Houses.

"DLHRY OF Jl PECULIAR GIRL," BY J? .NEW OTTJiOR
Arv UnknoWn Writer Contributes Pictures of Upper English Society in
a Vein flbote the Mediocre, Under the Title, "A
Â» JoucH of SorroW"
For some years past there have been heard
from various quarters in the Southern States a
demand for a school history that would give a
Southern view of the war between the States.
This demand may have arisen from a real de
sire on the part of the Southern people for
such a history, or it may have been worked up
by some Southern publishing-house that de
sired a contract for supplying such a book.
Whatever may have been the cause of the de
mand, it has at last been gratified. We have
received the complete advance sheets of the
book, which was written by the Rev.
John W. Jones, D.D.. and bears the title "A
School History of the United States."
Mr. Jones, who served during the war as a
chaplain of the Army of Northern Virginia,
and was later a chaplain of the University of
Virginia and secretary of the Southern Histor
ical Society, is the author of several works and
holds quite a high rank in Southern litera
ture. In this work, however, he makes no
attempt at literary excellence. The history is
evidently intended for primary classes. It is
divided Into short paragraphs, dealing with
the events of our history in the order of
their occurrence, and no attempt is made to
connect the paragraphs in any literary se
quence. They simply follow one another like
dates in an almanac. At the close of each
chapter there follows a series of questions for
the use of teachers in making examinations.
The Southern character of the book is shown
In many ways. Nine pages are given to an
account of the settlement of Virginia alone,
and only six to the settlement of all the New
England States. Four pages and a half are de
voted to a biography of Jefferson Davis, and
only one to an account of Lincoln. As a mat
ter of course the right of secession is asserted,
and the whole course of the war is treated from
a Southern standpoint. There is, however, no
attempt to inculcate any hostility to the
Union as it now exists, nor is there any un
fairness in the statements made of the events
of the war or the causes which lei to it.
It was, of course, to be expected that the
South would tell her side of the war story and
give her view of its causes, and it is moreover
very natural In Southern people to desire that
their children should learn history as they
themselves understand it. It is hardly likely,
however, that the present work will be pleas
ing, even to the South. The author is evi
dently too old a mar and lives too much in
the past to deal rightly with the great issue.
A good school history of the Republic is cer
tainly very much needed. Neither the North
nor the West, any more than the South, has
one that it can be proud of. Whichever sec
tion produces one will be a benefactor to all,
but it must be a National and not a sectional
history. There is no more need in the South
ern schools for a Southern history than there
is in the nonconformist schools of England
for a Puritan history of the days of Cromwell.

The Tr.uch of Sorrow.
The identity of the author of this story,
which deals with the English upper classes, is
not revealed, but "The Touch of Sorrow" is
a study from Hie doubtless, by some woman
in society. The book possesses more. merit
than the average novel of the day; there is
nothing unwholesome about it; its perusal
cannot be altogether unprofitable, and the
book will be laid down at the close of the story
with satisfaction. Stella Morecombe is "The
Study." As a child she has lived a curiously
solitary life, undisturbed by any deep emo
tions. Her mother is dead ; her father's life is
daily taken up with the cause of science, and
she is brought up by her governess, who only
succeeds in winning from her pupil an easy
tolerance in place of affection. It was her pe
culiar gift that she knew when she was happy ;
her peculiar difficulty that she feared sorrow
intensely. She was impatient with any one
in the world who was not as radiant as
herself and resented the faintest shadow
thrown across her path. Her happiness is un
alloyed in love-making and marriage.
Trouble comes to branches of her family, but
scenes of funereal woe create in her a strange
unnatural repulsion. Her heart seems stony
and there is worrier at her callousness. Many
who loved her love her no more. Then Stella
becomes a mother and she adores her babe.
Death takes her little one away and in her
depth of woe Stella lifts her voice and heart
to heaven. At last God seems to take the
horror of loneliness away. Over the flower
decked grave of the babe the fond ones of
old are clasped in love and tears and all old
wounds are healed. "Death was there. and
birth also, for Stella felt dimly that a new soul
had come to her and to those who stood about
her its radiance was visible in her face." â

The Diary of a Peculiar Girl.
This Is a new book by a new â George
Austin Woodward. It is written in a fairly
bright style, though there hardly appears
within its. pages sufficient of incident, start
ling or otherwise, to merit its length. Indeed,
the whole book could well be condensed into
a breezy sketch of a few thousand words.
The "peculiar" girl In the book acts to us
very much after the pattern of any other
young feminine person. Those whom she ad
mires she characterizes as "nice"â the others
are "horrid." She drives, reads, frolics and
diarizes in a precisely similar way to hundreds
of her class and circumstances. She also pro
tests vigorously against the embraces of a
young masculine acquaintance, wherein, per
haps, she may not resemble other '"peculiar"
girls, though this may be a libel on them.
The "Diary of a Peculiar Girl" will serve to
pass an idle hour during the summer vacation.

Checked Through.
Richard Henry Savage has written a story of
the detective order relating to New York City
life, in "Checked Throughâ Missing, Trunk
No. 17580." It is issued in the Rialto Series,
No. 73. Some flashlight views of darkest Tam
many are given, and the reader's interest is
kept up throughout The story has much to
do with metropolitan police and their meth
ods, and a striking part is played by a million
airess detective. The nature of the plot may
be judged from these cogitations of a chief of
police, at the close of the tale: "In thirty
years of police life. l've tried to find out why
the innocent often suffer in place of the guilty,
and I have failed to find the answer, either In
the codes or in the counsels of the wise. There
is something strange in the uselessness of
crime; something awful in the terrible rush
ing tide of temptation; something mockingly
cruel in the final frultlessness of evil deeds.
But for cold heartlessness, for crafty brutality,
for a devilish unpitying wickedness," give me
always the educated man or woman who goes
wrong. There's no limit to. their fiendish
nt'ss." [Chicago: Rand, McNally & Co., pub

An Army Wife.
The works of Captain Charles King are al
ways awaited with interest by a large circle of
readers. Hi* latest contribution to American*
literature, "An Army Wife," is a real love
story, fashioned from the intrigues of women,
and set in the severe military life of a Western
fort. While not the best of Captain King's
works it is very readable and fully sustains
the reputation of the author. If we want to
know how they live; how they act, talk, make
love and retail gossip in a frontier military
fort, a perusal of "An Army Wife" will furnish
the desired information. [New York: F. Ten

From an unseen thrush's throat!
All the pipes o' morning play :

The Dancer in Yel ow.
Another novel for summer reading is "The
Dancer in Yellow," by W. E. Norris, issued in
Appleton's Town and Countiy Library. The
heroine is Daisy Villlers, a queen of burlesque,
who is married in secret to Frank Coplestone,
a younger son of a British nobleman. Frank
begs the girl to quit the stage and assume the
name to which she is entitled, but Daisy
laughs the idea to scorn. She can't find it in
her blood to leave the stage while she is able
to win the plaudits of admiring audiences
and the e>pecial praise of lordly people. Mean
time Frank's boyish passion cools and he
is the object of attentions from a beautiful
widow, who has been engaged to a de
! ceased brother of Daisy's husDand. This
! brother's death brings Frank into line for
| his father's title and estates, and suddenly
the father's demise makes Frank Lord Cople
stone. The latter even then is faithful to the
dancer in yellow. She breaks down, and it is
j then that, with a spirit comparable, in a way,
j to that which existed in the breast of the
I humble " 'Ostler Joe," the lord takes Daisy
| Villiers to his home, where she dies as
Lady Coplestone. It need hardly be said
that Daisy hud outlived her reputation, and
she was glad to die in order that greater
happiness might come to Coplestone In a wiser
marriage, and that the title of his house might
receive no stain from her. The widow before
alluded to befriends Daisy in her last hours,
and afterward succeeds to the title of Lady
Coplestoue. Lord and lady then keep gay with
waving daffodils the grave of the Dancer in
Yellow. [New York: D. Appleton <fc Co. For

The Strry of Cuba.
There is little either of novelty or of value in
this book, by Murat Halstead. It appears to
have been compiled from clippings taken from
newspapers of recent date which are yet fresh
in the minds of those who have followed the
various phases of the Cuban trouble in the
public press. The author has acted as corre
spondent of various daily journals at the seat
of war and hence may be supposed to have
gathered considerable Information regarding
the situation. The somewhat pompous dec
laration of Mr. Halstead that he enjoys "the
confidence of the Cubans" and the "candid
expression of their interpretation of events"
scarcely justifies the presentation ot a mere
scrapbook of clippings. Nor is his "sense of
duty to the veracity of history" any further
apoloey for his work. [Chicago: The Werner

Paimos.
This unveiling or interpretation of the Book
'. of Revelation is one of considerable value to
i the student of theology, to whatever denomin
ation he may belong. The work has been done
| and admiraDly by Rev. Charles Beecher, the
| author of several works of a like character.
The author in an interesting manner deals
j with the Apocalypse of St. John, treating of
the environment of the apostle, the character
j of the vision and the literalness of the symbols
in the light of history, altogether a work that
will commend itself to theologians as casting
much lieht upon disputed questions in that
most difficult of scriptural subjects, the Book
j of Revelation. [Boston: Lee <t Shepara. For

Isaac Pitnnn Shorthand.
The publishers of the Isaac Pitman system
of shorthand, always notably to the fore in in
creasing their already large library of phono
graphic works, have just published a new edi
tion of their "Teacher." As in the case of
many other things British, American students
of the art of brief writing were loth to take
hold of the new importation, preferring to ex
pand their energies upon some system which
promised a fabulous rate of speed at the end
of one week or one fortnight's study. The ex
perience of older shorthand writers, however,
has demonstrated that all such mushroom sys
tems were valueless and totally Incapable of
producing even fair results. Some three years
ago Clarence Pitman, a nephew of the vener
able Sir Isaac, was sent out to New York to es
tablish a branch of the London and Bath es
tablishments. To-day the Isaac Pitman system
is recognized by the public schools of New
York and in other large cities.
The Teacher mentioned previously costs 20
cents and can be heartily recommended to
those wishing to pursue a fascinating study
which has stood the attacks of more than half
! a century of time and which will prove both
useful and remunerative to the student. [New

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1896.
THE
UNIVERSAL PRAYER
It is perhaps not generally known that the great .
French astronomer and scientific popnlarlzer,
Flammarion, loves from time to time to pene
trate* beneath "the outside of things" and to seek:
the soul of nature. In bis scientific romance,
"Cranle," occur many beautiful, true and , highly
poetic allusions of this kind; but In a collection of
his writings on various natural subjects entitled,
"In Heaven and Earth" (Dans le del et sur ie
Terre), we find a little chapter so profoundly
charming and unlike the ordinary works of "on
devont astronomers" that we may be excused for
translating it for the benefit of our readers. It is
headed "The Universal Prayer."
One summer's evening I had quitted the â 
flowery slopes of Saute Adresse, a delicious
marine villa hung upon the hammock of the
hills, to mount westward the heights of Cape
Heve. When one looks at these heights from
the loot of the cliffs one imagines colossuses of
atone reddened by the sun, motionless giants
who are present as petrified witnesses, at the
formidable movements of the sea, and who
feel them dying at their feet. These enormous
masses, inaccessible from the shore, alone ap
pear worthy of dominating the grand specta
cle. Beside them, as when near the sea, man
seems so small that be soon loses sight of his
own existence and feels himself united with
the mingled life which hovers over the sound
of the waves.
I had mounted gradually to the Higher
level, where the signals stand to announce to
far-off ships the hourly movement of the tides
upon the shore, where the light kindles at the
coming of the night like a fixed star upon the
dark immensity. The glorious orb of day was
still suspended, glowing in the clouds of pur
ple. â¢ â¢ â¢ Above, the blue sky crowned me
with its purity. Below, the heather, peopled
with active insects, raised its couch of per- â¢
fumes. I walked to the scarped edge, at "he
bottom ot which yawns the abyss. At the edge
of the vertical bluff the eye dominates the im
mensity of the sea, which* extends to the left,
from southeast to northwest, and if it looks
down perpendicularly the sight is lost in the
depth of the green escarpment of the rocks
and brushwood, a rourh carpet, spread at three
hundred feet below this rampart. The roar of
the waves barely mounts to here, and the ear
only perceives a uniform sound, of which the
â¢wind sustains the murmuring intensity.
It is a silence, this far-off chant of the sea.
Nature was attractive to the last adieu which
the prince of light was giving to the world be
fore descending from his throne and disap
pearing under tne liquid horizon. Calm And
reflective, she was assisting at the universal
prayer of the creatures; for they were praying
their holy orison of thankfulness as they re
ceived the last glance of the good sun; all,
from the soft and solitary medusa, from the
starfish with his purple fringe, up to the chirp
ing grasshoppers, up to the snow-halcyon, all .
were thanking Him piously.
And it" was like incense rising from the
waves and mountains, and it seemed as if the
tempered rumbling on the shore, the breeze
. which blew from the continent, the embalmed
atmosphere, the light dying into the serenity
of the blue, the cooling of the ardors of the
day, as if all things in this place had con
sciousness of their existence, and participated
with love in that universal adoration.
To that holocaust of the earth was united In
my thoughts the attractions of the spheres,
not only those which bring near or draw away
our globe from the run's center, but 'again the '
sympathies of all the stars gravitating in the
immensity of the, heavens. Above my head
were extended the sublime harmonies and the
gigantic movements of the celestial bodies.
The earth was becoming an atom floating in
the infinite. But lrom that atom to all the
suns of space, to those whose light takes mil
lions of years to reach us, to - those which lie
unknown, beyond human ken, 1 felt an invisi
ble bond attaching in the unity of a single
creation all the universes and all the minds.
And the immense prayer of the immeasurable
heaven had its echo, its strophe, its visible
representation in that of the terrestrial life
which vibrated around me, in the sound of the
sen, in the perfumes of the shore, in the last
note of th' 3 bird in the woods, in the confused
melody of insects, in the moving assemblage of
that scene, and above all in 'the admirable
illumination of that twilight
I looked. But I was so small In the midst
of that rendering of thanks that the grandeur
of the spectacle overcame me. I felt my per
sonality vanish before the immensity of na
ture. Very soon it seemed to me that I could
neither speak nor think. The vast sea ex
tended infinitely. I no longer existed, and my
eyes were covered with a veil. I gazed with
out seeing, lost upon the mountain. The sea
fled into infinity, and the creatures continued
their prayer.
And the sun, source of that light and of
that life, looked for the last time above the
â¢ horizon of the seas, ana when he had received
that homage of all the creatures, which none
among them had thought ol refusing, he ap
peared satisfied with: that day, and descended
gloriously toward the hemisphere of the other
peoples.
Then a great silence took place in nature.
Clouds of purple and gold flew toward the
royal couch and hid the last blushing gleams.
The waves were- soothed.-for the wind which
sw~:pt them upon the beach had fallen/ The
little winged beings went to s'.eep, and the
star, forerunner of the evening, kindled in the
ether.
"O mysterious Unknown!" cried I; "great
Beingâ immense Being I who are we then? Su
preme authority of harmony, who, then, art
thou, if thy work is so great? Poor human
mites who think they know thee. OGod! O .
God! Atomsâ nothings! How small we are!
How little we are ! .
"How great thou art! Who then dared to
name thee for the first time! Who is then the
proud madman who for the first' time pro
tended to define thee! O.God! 0 my God!
all powerfulness and all tenderness, sublime
and unfathomable immensity!
"And what name to give those who have de
nied you, to those who do not believe in you,
to those who live without a thought of you, to
those who never felt your presence, O Father
of Nature. ,3E@g|
"O, I love thee, I love thee! sovereign and
unknown cause. Being whom no human
speech can name, I love you, O divine princi
ple! but I am so small that I know not if you
hear me."
As these thoughts rushed out of my soul to
Join the great affirmation of entire nature,
some clouds withdrew from the sunset and the
golden cadence of the enlightened regions in
undated the mountain.
"Yes! Thou ' nearest ' me, O Creator! Thou
who gives to the little flower of the fields its
beauty and its perfume. The voice of the
ocean does not drown mine, and my thought
rises to thee, O my God! with -the prayer of
all."
From the top of the promontory my sight ex
tended to the south ' like to the west, over the
plain like over the sea. Turning I perceived
the human cities half hidden upon the shore.
All Havre, the shopping streets were illu
minated and, further on, upon the opposite
side, at Trouville. the car of pleasure lighted
up its lanterns. ."'-,
And while nature had recognized herself be
fore God to salute the mission of one of his
faithful stars; while all creatures had united
their prayers, and the roaring flood of the seas

There has appeared a fourth edition of Dr.
Jerome A. Anderson's "Reincarnation," and
there has also been a German translation of
the work, all of which would seem 1 to prove
that there is a great deal of interest In the
subject treated by Dr. Anderson in this book.
As its name' implies, the work is one that treats
of that ever fascinating problem contained in
the queries, "Whence came I?" "Whither do I
go?"
There is no human being of intellectual
power sufficient to formulate these questions
who has not asked them. Christianity, as
taught to-day, deals with but one of the ques
tions, the latter, and with this in varying
ways, most of which are entirely unsatisfac
tory to a very considerable proportion of men
and women who are nominally Christians.
"Reincarnation is the only explanation for
both of these questions," says Dr. Anderson,
and he says it in a scientific, philosophical and
yet altogether interesting mannerâ and evi
dently believes it himself.
"We are born on this earth many, many
times," he says, and he argues it out upon that
line with a showing of much logic, and many
circumstances and analogies cited from known
laws of nature would seem to bear him. out.
"Life can only be explained philosophically
by reincarnation," says the author, and it may
be noted in passing that some of the greatest
sa?es the world has known have held the same
belief. When they brought the blind man to
Jesus they asked him if the man were born
blind for some sin of his own or for his parents'
sin. "And how could hp be born blind for a
fault of his own if he had not previously ex
isted?" ask these latter-day believers in the
very ancient teaching of reincarnation.
The introductory chapters of Dr. Anderson's
book are devoted to the -'nature and origin of
the soul" and the presentation of pnysiologi
cal evidence in support of the existence of the
soul. That the boot has gone through three
editions and now appears in the fourth speaks
emphatically for its human interest, at least.

WHEN \\K ABE PARTED.
When we are parted let me lie
In some far corner of thy heart.
Silent, and from the world apart,
.Like a forgotten melody:
Forgotten of the world beside.
Cherished by one, and one alone,
For some loved memory of its own;
Bo let me in thy heart abide
When we are parted.
When we are parted, keep for ma
The sacred stillness of the night; -
That hour, sweet love, Is mine by right;
Let others claim the day of tbee !
The cold world sleeping at our feet, '
My spirit shall discourse with thineâ
When stars upon thy pillow shine, '
. At thy heart's door I stand and beat.
Though we are parted.'

The Pan-Russian Exhibition.
We are In receipt of the comprehensive
guide-book of the Pan-Russian Exhibition of
1896 at Nijni Novgorod, issued under the di
rection of the Imperial Commission. The
book of 240 pages is replete with information
concerning not only the fair but the town and
the country about it, and contains some very
interesting historical sketches accompanied
by appropriate illustrations by Russian artists.
The Nijni Novgorod exhibition buildings will
cover an area of 230 acres, somewhat larger
than that of the Paris Exposition of 18S9.
This Russian fair will probably be an astonish
ing revelation to the world at large, as it will
demonstrate what wonderful progress the
Czar's people have made since 1882, when the
last Pan-Russian Exhibition was held In Mos
cow. The guide-book gives , a retrospective
glance over what has been achieved in the em
pire during the thirteen peaceful years of the
reign of the predecessor of the recently
crowned ruler of all the Russias. [St. Peters

When Rudyard Kipling was assistant editor
of the Pioneer, a leadincr paper in India, he
spent a vacation in Rajputana, and wrote for
its columns a vivid account of some of the old
Rajput cities under the title of "Letters of
Marque." According to the Athenaeum, they
were rcpublishea in pamphlet form, but with
drawn owing to some difference with regard to
the copyrights. This has now been amicably
settled, and the letters will probably be
brought out soon.
In connection with the prices at which some
early editions were disposed of at the sale of
the Crampon Library, last month. Critic says
it is worth recalling that the sum Milton re
ceived for "Paradise Lost, " a copy of the first
issue of which was sold for Â£90, was Â£5 ; and
for the "Vicar of Wakefleld," for which Â£63
was paid for a 1776 copy on the Â«ame day,
Goldsmith received Â£60. Longfellow, by the
way, received perhaps the largest sum ever
paid for a poem, $4000, for "The Hanging of
the Crane."
As the Westminster Gazette remarks, It was
a happy idea of John Murray to secure the
services of Byron's grandson, the Earl of Love
lace, for the editing of the definitive edition of
the poet's works which he is to publish. Lord
Lovelace is the son of Ada, whom Byron spoke
of as "the sole daughter of my house and
heart," and has always taken a great interest
in all that concerns his distinguished relative.
In addition to the new material collected for
many years by Mr. Murray, who is himself a
Byron expert, the edition will contain unpub
lished MSS. and letters contributed by the
editor from Lord Byron's correspondence wita
Lady Byron and other persons. Altogether,
the edition promises to be in every respect
worthy of the poet's fame and of tne historic
publishing-house with which he had such in
timate relations.
A Journalistic Error.
The poster design published on this page
June 21 last was erroneously labeled, "An

The Call now desires to amend in every way
possible. The design in question was copied
almost directly and with but very slight
changes from the May Cosmopolitan. The
caption should have read, "Design for a Mod
ern Art Poster, from the Cosmopolitan for
May," and this line was set, but, unfortu
nately, and with no intention on the part of
the editors, was supplanted in the form by the
line published and which had been "standing"
for several weeks. THÂ£CALi,has no desire, nor

THE MAN
WHO GERRIES A BIG
LANTERN
.NEVER GOES WITHOUT IT
May Be Looking for the JHonest
JÂ»len â He Says the Lantern
Once SaVed the
Gountry
There is nothing particularly unusual
about the appearance of Frank Lawrence
the first time one sees him. He is only an
old man who hobbles slowly along the
streets, with a cane in one band and a
lantern in the other. But from the fact
that old "Frank" has carried that lantern
constantly for at least twenty years, he at
once becomes an unusual character.
Just when Frank struck San Erancisco
is something past finding out. He has
forgotten and most likely nobody else ever
knew, or cared for ihat matter. All that
is known about the old man is that he is
one of the landmarks of the vicinity oi
Clay and Kearny streets.
He has made that part of town his
headquarters for years and years, although
he eats and sleeps in ail manner of places.
Sometimes be has a room in one of the
alleys of Chinatown, but more often be
walks the streets during the hours that
the greater portion of the saloons are
closed.
But no matter where Frank may be he
always carries his lantern with him, day
and night, winter and summer. It is one
of the big olri-fnsbioned railroad lanterns
that belongs to toe era ol band-brakes and
uncomfortable traveling. The apparatus
is still in good order, although the glass
globe is cracked badly. It has been that
way for years, Frank says, and he never
expects to get another one for it. The
cracks don't make much difference,
though, because the lantern is never
lighted.
Where did Frank get the lantern, and
why does he carry it? are questions a per
con will naturally ask, but they are not
easy to answer. In fact, Frank is the only
person in the world who can answer them,
and he refused to do so except in a general
way.
Sometimes the loafers about the park
will chaff the old man about the lantern.
He takes it good-naturedly, until some
body makes a break to take ;t away from
him and then there is trouble. He fairly
boile with race and is ready to fight.
"Don't touch that lantern," he says. "It
saved the Union once and I will guard it
with the last drop of my blood."
But how, when or where the lantern
saved the Union be refuses to divulge.

KnoWs What Is Qood
to Eat
Joshua Lutton lives on the edge of the
marsh on the bay shore almost due east
from Redwood City. His borne is not a
pleasant one to look at, nor even to get
near for that matter. It is only a small
shanty, built of all sorts of odds and ends
of such stuff as he has managed to pick
up along the shore. But it is picturesque
in the extreme, and old Joshua is one of
t ha queerest men in the State.
Joshua says he is 85 years old, but he
doesn't look it, for he is as hale and
hearty a man as can be seen in a day's
journey. He is as straight as a ship's
mast and his complexion is ruddy with the
glow of health. He wears very little
clothes, but such as they are are not un
usual in any way. What is peculiar about
Joshua, though, is the food he eats, which
consists entirely of frogs and a few oysters.
The place that Joshua calls his home is
in about as unhealthy a spot as can be
found. The malarial exhalations of the
marsh fill the air for miles around, and
everything about his home is soaked with
the damp, clammy vapor. And yet he is
happy and healthy, and says he would not
live anywhere else if he could. He says
anybody can live where be does if they
j will live on the right kind of food. He is
; perfectly willing to talk about his diet, but
] it is impossible to get him to say a word
j about anything else. He won't even tell
| where he was born.
"The reason people are sick in this
world," Baid Joshua, "is because they don't
{ eat the right kind of food. Some eat meat
j and some try to live on vegetables. But
they ain't either one right. It ain't right
to eat meat, because you hurt the animal
when yon kill it. If you try to live on
vegetables you will mighty soon starve to
death. Now 1 have solved the problem by
eating frogs and oysters. They ain't
either one of them got any feeling and
they are as nourishing as the fattest beef
that was ever killed. I catch all the frogs
I want right at my door, and by taking
my boat I can get a "load of oysters in an
hour. 8o you see I have all 1 want to eat
and drink, and a comfortable place to
sleep, and I don't have to worry myself to
death. Try it yourself a week or two and
j I am sure you will never Jivo as folks gen-
I erally do again.''

ORIGINAL
SCHEME OF JOHN
PAGANINI
.HIS GEMUS LN FIJJJLNCE
Odd f\ei - Drying Establishment
That Enables an Ex-Fisher
man to LiVe With
out Work
This story is about John Paganini,
but the individual is no relative of the
famous violinist. Still he is a genius â a
genius of financeâ and were his talents
devoted to the real money battles of the
world there is little doubt but that he
would 'make the reputation of a "Na
poleon. * He really has the talent, be
cause he is now a monopolist.
At present John has the only net-drying
institution in the State, if not in the
whole country. John's place of business
is on the southern bay shore, where there
are no smooth spots of dry land to stretch
fish nets where the sun will strike them.
In fact, it is pretty hard to find a square
foot of dry land without crawling through
several miles of Mack, slimy marsh crass.
Many years ago John was a fisherman
himself, and in those days he used to take
| his nets all the way to Baden Point to dry
them. To overcome this he hit on the
bright idea of driving a few poles in the
mud of the marsh in front of his house
and stretching his nets between them.
I The scheme worked perfectly, and soon
the other fishermen came around to borrow
| John's poles. John loaned them a few
I times and then concluded to rent them by j
! the Lour. This scheme worked also, and ;
in less than a month John bad a dozen
poles in position and was drawing such a
large income from each that be quit doing
any fishing.
It seems strange that the other fisher
men should not put in poles of their own
and save the money they now pay to John.
But possibly tney have never thought of
it. Another and a better explanation, \
however, is that John has a.. little bar in
connection with his net-drying business, {
: where the thirsty fishermen can find
' liquid comfort while their nets are drying, j
I They can also find a neat little game of i
I monte and a few other things dear to the
I heart of the natives of the shores of the
j Mediterranean. Â£"â  â¢ ;
As has been stated John is a genius, and !
i is perfectly. willing, to give his customers j
anything they want.

LOOKS

OF A CITY
X DEJST.H VJJLLEY CLIFF
The Deceptive Appearance of a
Range of Red Sandstone
on the Amargosa
Greek
There are many strange sights to be
seen in the desolate alkali pit between the
Telescope and Kingston mountain ranges.
Death Valley is here and so are the un
canny "Resting Springs." But more pur
prising than these is a cliff of dark red
sandstone that stretches from north o
south from a spur of the foothilis that lie j
alone the shore of Amargosa Creek.
To pass the western side of this ridge |
one would not be attracted by its appear- j
ance, and even the eastern side of it does !
not look particularly unusual in the morn- j
ing hours. But approach it from the east ;
in the afternoon and you will rub your j
eyes to be sure you are seeing things
straieht. Or possibly you will think it a i
mirage.
When the sun has sunk behind the cliff
and the sky is a blare of light that throws ;
the landscape into deep purple shadows
there is not a man living who, on seeing !
the cliff for the first time, but would
think he was coming to a walled city built
by some of the old Aztecs. There is no
denying the resemblance. There are the
square buildings with the towers and
chimneys. Almost in the center of the !
town is a large dome, so perfect in outline i
that it bardly seems possible it was not
the work of human hands.
The illusion is producrd by the peculiar
rock formation, which is really common |
in the locality, only it don't often happen
to be combined in the way to produce a
walled city. The forces that caused the j
rocks to take their present forms were i
earthquake and the action of running â 
waterâvery much the same as created the
marvelous Canyon of the Colorado.
The extent of this "city" Is about half !
a mile long and three or four hundred feet :
wide. There really is nothing about the j
rocks to make a city, but the shapes and
sizes of them are such as to produce the
right combination of lines to make them
look like a city. Although it is only 300
feet acrcsi the top of the cliff, the different
sizes of rocks and the way they are placed
makes it look to be at least a mile. When
the light from the evening sky just touches
the top of the cliff, each projecting ridge I
looks like a building, and the whole seems !
to be a town of several thousand inhabit
ants. I
A RUSTIC
LANE IN THE HEART
OF TOWN
LIJIED BY PEPPER TREES
DoWntoWn Gottages and Front
Yards That Seem to Be
long to an Earlier
period
How many, even old residents of San
Francisco, would believe that there was a
country town street in the hea 1 - 1 of the
City? It would be a surprise to most of
them, and a still greater surprise when
they were told that it was within 500 feet
of the Palace Hotel.
The accompanying picture is a faithful
drawing from a photograph of Anthony
street, which runs north from Mission, and
is the first street east of Second. It is one
of the oldest streets in San Francisco and
the present buildings were once considered
the finest houses in the City. The one
nearest Mission was put up for a boarding
bouse, but it was so far out of town then
that it was hard to get pc pie to live there.
As the City grew beyond them they in
creased in value, and as the same lady
who started in still Kept them she had all
the boarders she wanted ana at the best
prices.
But those days have passed away and
the lady who started the boarding-house
has been dead many years. Still the
houses have been changed very little ex
cept to grow moldy and dilapidated. The
pepper trees that were planted in the
front yards are still there and have grown
to giants of their kind.
To look down this old street from Mis
sion it is hard to believe that it is a part of
San Francisco in the year 1896. The
houses themselves are old-fashioned
enough, but the front yards surely belong
to another age. The dilapidated picket
fences look as if they belonged to some of
the old towns that the miners left years
ago and have been trying to keep in ex
istence ever since. Inside the yards are
some old plank walks to keep people's
feet dry in rainy weather. The old green
shutters are still there, though having a
hard time of it to hang in place.
Few people ever walk through this
street, although it is well paved. In fact
that is the only thing about it that looks
like a modern street. One end of it opens
on Mission street and the other is closed
by a stable. One strange thing about this
street is that all of the houses are still
used for the same purposes as when they
were first put up. One is used for a resi
dence and all of the others are used for
boardiDE-laouses,
WILDER
MAKES ARTIFICIAL
SUNRISE
.MILKS BEFORE DJJYLI&HT
Jhe J^ean JricU of a Santa Gruz
Dairyman, Who Fools the
Stock by an Elec
tric Plant
Dairyman Wilder, whose milk-produc
ing establishment is about ten miles north
of Santa Cruz, is one of the most ingenious
I men in all California and has done what
no other dairyman ever attempted. Every
body that has ever tried to milk a cow
before daylight knows what a job it is.
Bossy is generally of the opinion that
there is a time for all things, and firmly
objects to being awakened and milked
when she thinks that she should be asleep.
Many cows will refuse to be milked to the
extent of kicking and lying down.
All of these troubles have been Dairy
man Wilder's, and not long ago he de
termined to overcome them. In fact, it
was necessary that he should, as he was
often late in getting milk to his customers
in Santa Cruz. It cost considerable money,
but he has more than made up for the out-
I lay. At present he has one of the finest
I individual electric light plants in the
State and his cows are as easy to milk as
in broad daylight.
When the electric plant was in position
j and ready for work there were three big
i arc lights over the center of the yard
j where the cows slept at night and dozens
j of others fixed all over the different build
i ings, the entire lot capable of producing
about 10,000 candlepower â enough to
make the yard as bright as day. The
plant was of the best quality and every
thing wa3 tried in the daytime before the
surprise was sprung on the cows.
It worked like a charm. The bright
rays of the light had no sooner been
i turned on than the cows commenced to
I get up. Most of them looked surprised to
i see the day break so soon, but when the
| milkman arrived with his pail they
| seemed to think it was all right and stood
perfectly still while being milked. The
light also affected the poultry, for. the
cocks commenced to crow and the hens
went around hunting for nests. Ducks,
geese, dogs and cats were all affected the
same way and the whole barnyard was
awake at 2 o'clock in the morning.
It has not proved a case of the animals
getting used to it, for they behave the
, same way now after the artificial sunrise
j has been in operation for several months.
Poor beasts, they are in blissful ignorance
* of Mr, Wilder's shabby tÂ«ek.

Nature abhors extremes no less than she
does a vacuum. "Where there is excessive
predilection for any particular thing that
object draws to it dangers that tend in a
measure at least to make its enjoyment
less of unalloyed pleasure.
This law has had a remarkable exempli
fication in the matter of philately, or
stamp-collecting. While it was a mere
schoolboy's pastime it attracted the at
tention of none nut those who found inno
cent pleasure in the accumulation of la
bels used to prepay postage, but since it
has become the diversion of professional
and business men and persons of affairs
these little bits of paper have taken on a
value that haÃ tempted to crime and
tragedy.
To fully appreciate the incentive that
sometimes exists to drive to robbery, in
sanity, murder, and even suicide, it must
be known that certain stamps are of such
great rarity that they command what to
the uninitiate seem fabulous prices, and
some are without price, as their owners are
men of great wealth who could not be in
duced to part with their philatelic gems
under any money temptation. On the
other hand there are enthusiastic collectors
who do not hesitate to sacrifice their own
personal comforts to the procuration of
some much coveted rarity, and others
again who, lacking proper moral poise,
would not be deterred by crime to obtain
the object of their almost insane desire.
In some cases disappointed philatelic
hopes have led to insanity, and in one in
stance in this City has led to suicide.
During the past month philatelists all
over the world have been stirred up over
the murder committed in Paris, which
had the possession of a valuable collection
of stamps for its object. More or less
mystery surrounds the tragedy.
Julien Emile Delahaeff, just turned 23.
one of the many small Parisian dealers
who may be seen every Tuesday and Sun
day trafficking in stamps at the open-air
bourse on the Champs Eiysees, was the
victim.
Delahaeff was a consumptive and un
able to do any manual labor. About
three years ago he entered the ranks of
the dealers in stamps and soon established
a lucrative trade.
On April 11 young Delahaeff received a
visit from a man who said he lived in the
Rue de Turenne, and between whom and
the deceased there had been some previous
transactions in stamps. From this per
son Delahaeff bought a stamp collection
for $400.
The day following a letter came to the
young dealer asking him to meet the
writer, who signed himself Darcis, at the
Cafe dcs Negociants, near the Louvre, for
the purpose of transacting stamp business.
Delahaeff became a little suspicious, but
cc resolved to go to the rendezvous. He
took with him, however, as s precaution,
a younger brother. On arriving at the
Cafe dcs Negociants they looked in vain
for anybody of the description given, and
returned home believing they had been
made victims of a stupid practical joke.
Next morning, however, another letter
came from Darcis. In this communica
tion the young man was asked to lunch
with his mysterious correspondent in the
Hotel de la Girond, Rue Jean Jacques
Rousseau. He was also requested to take
with him the stamp collection he had re
cently purchased. Delahaeff kept the ap
pointment, saw Darcis, lunched with him,
and, according to his own account when
he returned home, agreed to sell to his
peculiar acquaintance for $800 the collec
tion he had bought for $400. No money
was paid down nor did tbe collection
change hands. Delahaeff s father and his
friends cautioned him to be careful, but
he said he had every confidence in the
man.
Tne next day Delahaeff received a
postal card, and complyine with the re
quest it contained went to 61 Avenue de
Versailles. That was the last seen of him
by relatives and friends. His father's
anxiety was somewhat relieved by the
receipt of a postal card stating Emile had
gone to visit some friends at Varenne
Saint Hilaire. A few days later he re
ceived a letter from a stranger informing
him that his son was about to start for
America, having sold his stamp collec
tion for |920.
This thoroughly alarmed the father,
who at once communicated with the Pre
fecture of Police. Detectives, acting with
all the swiftness and sagacity of their pro
totypes in French fiction, arrested Joseph
Aubert and a female accomplice on a
charge of having willfully murdered the
missing philatelist.
Paris was the scene of even a more
startling tragedy than this about four
years ago, and for which the inciting
cause was the overwhelming desire to
possess a single philatelic gem of the first
water. It was enacted early in June,
1892, in the Rue de Poisson, when Gaston
Leroux, a philatelist, well known in the
city, was found dead in his apartments,
with a great gash in his throat through
which his life had flowed away. It was a
criuie that long puzzled the authorities.
Leroux lived alone, was wealthy, had
few callers and, as far as any one knew,
interested himself in nothing except the
collecting of stamps. For many years an
old woman had been accustomed to look
after his rooms every morning. On that
June morning when she reached the apart
ments she went in by a rear door, as was
her habit, and began to dust. It was not
until she had furbished up two rooms and
reached the third that she came upon the
body of tbe murdered man and fled with
a cry of terror.
The police were puzzled by the crime
from the start. There seemed no motive.
Although there was a large amount of
money in the rooms none seemed to have
been taken. In a desk close beside where
the body lay there was a small drawer
partly open, showing several pieces of gold
coin and a diamond-studded watch. This
showed the motive could not have been
robbery. Nor could the police find that
the man had a single enemy.
When the fact of the murder became
known to the public one of the first per
sons to hurry to the house was Hector
Giroux. He admitted readily enough that
he had called on the dead man the night
before and found him in perfect health.
The best detectives in Paris were put on
the case. It was one of these, a week after
the murder, who found a possible motive
for the murder. In looking over the index
in the album containing the collection of
stamps all were accounted for but one.
That was a Hawaiian two-cent stamp of
the 1852 issue, known as the missionary
stamps. At that time this stamp was
quoted at $2000. The detective searched
every shop in the city where such a stamp
would be likely to be sold.
Finally suspicion fell on Giroux, when
it was found that he, too, was an enthu
siastic philatelist. Through the ordinary
channels the detective secured an intro
duction to this man under the guise of a
stamp collector. For months he watched
and waited, becoming in time the close
friend ana companion of Giroux. One
night the newly made friend of Giroux
turned the conversation on the subject of
Hawaiian stamps and the missionary
stamps in particular. Of these there are
but three denominations â 2 cent, 5 cent
and 13 cent, the rarest being the 2 cent. In
a burst of enthusiasm Giroux exhibited
one of the 2-cent denomination.
He was arrested the next day for the
Leroux murder, after the proof haU oeen
obtained that there was only one speci
men of the stamp mentioned in Paris.
The evidence was circumstantial, but
Giroux was a novice in crime, and con
fessed that he had killed his friend after
he had refused to sell him the Hawaiian
stamp, which he needed to complete the
set of the issue to which it belonged.
Not less strange was the death of Arthur
Tilden a; this City several years ago, after
a vain search for a 10-cent Baltimore
stamp, an oblong label of most homely
design, but extremely rare, issued by the
Postmaster of the Maryland town. He
swallowed a quantity of carbolic acid, and
his friends felt sure that he ended his life
during a period of insanity, brought on by
his philatelic mania.
For months he had been interested in
no other topic than that of the stamp he
had set his mind and heart upon obtain
ing. Two days after he was buried his
diary was found, showing entries for each
day for a month before his death, proving
beyond a doubt that he had long contem
plated suicide, but had put it off from day
to day, in hopes of finding a copy of the
rara avis. At the close of most of the en
tries there appeared the line: "To-mor-
row I may find it."
Two months ago the rarest variety of
this particular stamp was brought to light
in the East and was sold to its present
owner for $4400, the highest price by $1900
ever paia for a single stamp.
Another stamp which may bave led to
murder, although the police are not quite
sure of it, even though murder was done,
was a Brattleboro, a copy of which was
sold in New York recently for $650. Dun
can Teasdale, who was stopping at an up
town hotel when he bought the stamp at a
public sale, soon left the city. In London,
in Berlin and a half dozen of the larger
European cities Teasdale complained to
tne police that be was being dogged from
city to city by a man who wanted to gain
possession of a stamp which he carried.
The man was believed to be insane. Three
months alter he left New York Teasdale
was found murdered not far from Madrid,
in Spain. His valuable stamp was found
sewed in the lining of his vest.
Or\e of
Lifes Jragedies
The house was being cleaned out after mov
ing and two old shoes were thrown together
into tbe ash barrel. One was a neat black
shoe with buttons and the other was a dilapi
dated tan tie.
"Oh," said the black shoe, softly, "I am so
glad to get near come one to talk to. I've been
packed away In that dark box so long I've al
most forgotten how tne world looks, You
look to be about my Eize. Whose shoe are
you?"
The tan shoe answered with the none of Jts
owner. It was a pretty, girlish name, not fit
ting the disreputable shoe at all.
"Oh, were you hers?" said the black shoe,
joyfully, "then you can tell me about her, for
I wÂ«s hers, too. She was 20 when she packed
me away. How old is she now?"
"Twenty-five." said the tan shoe, looking
curiously at her neat companion.
"Then she must be even more lovely," went
on the black shoe. "How I should liite to see
her again. I have thought that soon she would
pack away some tiny shoes with me and I
would know she was happy."
"She is dead," saM the tan shoe, "dead and
buried. I was the last she wore."
"Dead! Oh, the pity of it! So young, so
good, co beautiful!"
"What are you saying?" cried the tan shoe in
amazement; "do you call her good? The world
called her bad,* and those who stood around
her coffin whispered that it was well her life
was ended."
"Why, her life was one of love and gentle
ness and quiet charity. Many an errand of
mercy I have trod with her. and she never
took a step that was not of purity and good
ness. That was only five years ago. Surely,
we did not belong to the same person."
"Yes ," said the tan shoe, "I think we did.
My owner was not good, and together we have
been in many places of wickedness; but I have
seen traces of your owner in her face some
times as she sat looking at the floor in the
solitude before she slept. I have wondered
what her face was before it became hard and
lined with sin. Tell me the last you remember
of her."
"I remember well," said the tan shoe, saÂ«ly.
"the last day when she put me away. She hod
been out with her lover and she came home so
bright and happy, and when she saw me lying
on the floor with my mate, she took us up and
said. Til put these shoes away until he comes
back ; they were tbe ones I wore when I saw
him first, and they shall be the ones I wear
when I go to my new home,' and she back us
under the clothes in a box, me in one corner
and my mate in tbe other. It was dark and
silent there, for I could not see or hear my
mate, and she never came to take us out. I
thought she forgot her pretty little fancy in
her joy."
"No," spoke the tan shoe, "she had no joy;
her lover never came back. I see It all now."
"But did people call her all bad?" asked the
pitying black shoe. "Did they not remember
the twenty years of gentle goodness to set
against the five of sin? You belonged to a sin
ful woman, but did I not belong to a righteous
one?"
"No," said the tan shoe, "to the world she is
only a Rinful woman. Did you not learn while
you walked the earth that people are judged
by the last shoes they wear?"
"The world is unjust and cruel, but tell me,
does the other world where mortals go juage
the same way? Are they judged in heaven by
the last shoes they wear? "
"That I do not know," replied the tan Bhoe,
"but as I sat behind the door I hear the minis
ter say of her that she bad gone before One
who saw deeper than mortal eye could go.
Maybe you and the other shoes of her innocent
days may avail her there."
The black shoe sighed and murmured as
the ashman shouldered the barrel, "I have
mourned because 1 was not a mortal with
loves aud hopes and immortality, but to-day 1
am glad to be an old shoe with oblivion be
fore me." O. E. H.
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1896.
The Old Salon and the ,New
/\n\ericarv /\rt Students Who HaVe Distinguished Jherrvsel^es
PARIS, June 17.â There ha=Â» already 1
been much disquietude expressed by
French papers over the progress made by |
foreign artists. The exhibitions of this j
year certainly emphasize the impression. I
The American school abroad distinguishes
itself by more than one remarkable can
vas. In the Champ de Mars â that is to
say a good dealâ in the Champs Eiysees it
would mean much less â there is a dreary
excellence that hovers over the Old Salon, i
a contentment with existing conditions
that threatens the future of French art
almost as much as the ultra modernity of
the Champ de Mars.
Three years ago the Rosicrucians were
almost too modern for the new salon.
Now it is not at all astonishing to en
counter them in the old. Three years is a
lifetime for a nineteenth century fad.
Paris accepts every new departure with re- J
spect. The Rosicrucians attracted much
young talent by their mysticism and, to be
frank, their remarkable capacity for adver
tising their own methods and aims. They
called themselves magicians and esthetes.
They did not have a catalogue but called
it "Geste esthetique," and they took for
their motto "Non nobis Domine, sed
nominis tui gloriae soli. Amen." They
were not only mystics, but they
considered themselves medieval Cath
olics, took the Gothic rose as
their symbol and called themselves

Rosicrucians. They were not only paint
ers, but held that music was a large part
of art, that music held color. At mid
nieht they addressed the spirits that de
scend over the all-genial artists with weird
music. In order to show their religious
sincerity, they ordered a mass on their
opening day â Notre Dame was the chosen
church, and the music from the evening
meal in "Parsifal" rolled in rich solemnity
from tbe great organ. When the last note
bad melted away, they drew the roses
from their buttonholes (they had assumed
on varnishing day), placed them on the
hilts of small daggers and made with
them the sign of the eroas, to the gaping
astonishment of the bewildered workmen
and small shopkeepers, who had come as
usual to attend early mass. The result
was that the picture-dealers, Durand-
Ruel, in spite of an exorbitant price of
admission, received 11,000 visitors on the
opening day alone. The greatest of the
magicians did the honors. He was called
Bar Peladan. He wore a costume of black
satin : around his pale bead fell a shower
of coal-black hair, which with his flowing
black beard made a figure memorable and
fantastic enough to create much diversion
among the less awestruck of the crowd.
Under all this absurdity there was and
remained an influence for good. This
cult, with mysticism as the bidden god
dess, was the first rebellion against the
realists. Romance and idealism were the
/\broad â John Sargent's portrait
banners they had dared to lift, and it was
a deed of admirable courage in this age of
negation, of scorn for sentiment, of wor
ship of the absolute and the real. They
held that the Fra Angelico angels had ac
complished more good than all the anni
hilating researches of Renan. If in their
pictures they allowed their imaginations
to run riot, especially in the questions of
mournful and mysterious symbolical
figures, rising out of mists of paint, with
faces in which startling eyes shone from
hollows under pale hair, and no other
features were distinguishable â all this
tendency to exaggeration has become the
hobby-horse of a few, and except as an in
fluence the Rosicrucian fever is a thing of
the past.
This is only one instance of the many in
which the most artistic nation of the
world runs afield; her painters run now
in so many directions that the plodding
and sober Scot, the hard-working Flemish
and Dutch painter, the keen ana eager
American are driving them from their
own ground.
At the head of the Anglo-American
school is Mr. John Gargent, who shows
but one portrait, that of Mr. Graham
Robertson. His loose and flowing brush
makes of the pale and delicate head
of the young English painter an
admirable example of his power to
model a solid head almost without
the aid of shadow. Mr. Robertson
has been painted against a dark screen.
The indefinite wall beyond ana the edge of
a canvas give tbe impression of distance
within the frame that makes Mr. Sargent's
figures so astonishingly alive. They have
walked into the frame, they can come for
ward or retreat within it without seriously
injuring themselves by violent contact
witn a painted wall, to which they have
apparently been pasted. It seems remark
ably simple the placing of a figure within
a frame, but it is in reality the most
subtle and the most delicate art.
Notice in this portrait the hand in light;
the lone and slender hand, that is solid
solid flesh painted against the overlong
coat, which would be so easy to ridicule if
it were not worn and painted with so
mucn distinction. Even the touch of paie
yet luminous color on the head of the
stick the young man holds is something to
regard with respect. It carries the light
and the Interest into the shadow.
There are a dozen paintings which would
attract attention if tney were not so pain
fully reminiscent. William Dannat's
clever portrait of the dancer Otero recalls
that rich and glowing canvas of Carmen
cita, with her insolent Spanish head dis
dainfully raised and the golden satin of
her skirt filling the small room in the gal
lery of the Luxembourg like a light under
an amber globe.
There is * nude fiimre of a woman
crouching on a bed, by Sargeant Kendall,
which also recalls the Luxembourg in that
remarkable unfinished work of Manet's
called "Olympia."
Humphrey Jonnston's portrait of his
mother is a very successful and original
piece of work. The gently severe figure
on the green sofa against the simple brown
background, with the faded gray of the
skin of hands and faceâ how charmingly
conceived and rendered !
Miss Cecilia Beaux exhibits for the first
time in France. There is hardly another
American woman who could paint as
strong a portrait as that of Dr. Grier;
the pose is simple and effective, and the
difference between the textures of the cos
tume and the absolute difference in the
texture of the skin drawn over the fore
head, the looser flesh under the cheek
bones and the smooth surface of the
hands are very well observed.
Mr. Boldini is astonishing, as usual.
His portrait of the "Princesse P." is a
woman in gray brocaded satin, sharply
outlined aeainst a darker background.
His crisp, black notes, the hair, the shad
ows, the edge of the profile, artificial as
they may be, add the interest that is com
pleted by his remarkable way of posing
the model.
Mr. Bony has a large somber study,
entitled "La Bible." There is a vague
suggestion of a woman, but we judge it as
all this
scientists construct a prehistoric animal
from a jawbone. Literally there is noth
ing visible but the chin of the woman, her
two hands and the book she holds.
One of the pleasantest portraits in the
new salon is that painted by Gandara.
It hanga in the dimly lit room in which the
"Last Supper," by Dagnaa Bouveret, is to
be seen. It is a conventional but very
delicate portrait of a young girl in white
satin, but for once the satin is subordi
nated to the fresh and sparkling head of
the girl herself. The modern garments
are calculated to overbalance any but the
strongest personality.
Mr. Latouche has a landscape that
seems to give forth light as well as to re
ceive it. It is truly Venetian in concep
tion and execution. What a blaze of color
in the yellow sails and golden reflections!
What spirit in these gay and vivid Italian
heads? What variety of treatment in the
wreathed boats that float down tbe water
that is so oily, so luminous, that shakes
and sparkles ana glitters and gleams with
such astonishing brilliance!
Miss Mathewcs has a very clever and a
very hideous portrait of a woman in a
morning-wrapper.
F. D. Marsh has a "Fantaisie" like a
Dannat; six Spanish women doing nothing
at all, against a very blue background. All
the six women have strange blue shadows
on their faces and look slightly decom
posed, making rather an uncanny picture.
Mr. Lavery is a canny Scot, and so very,
very canny in his portrait of Miss Mary B.
The usual white satin is a revelation of
pearly shimmering air. The ribbons, the
vase, the roses, all are forgotten when
looking at this remarkable woman, with
features as strong as those of a man and a
high and serious dignity. If it suggests
Whistler it suggests Watts no less, and
certainly Lavery more than either.
Edward Arthur Walton and James
Guthrie are two men of the Scotch school
who contest with Lavery the laurel of
greatest excellence. Walton has a land
scape, powerful and grave. It is not quite
fair to think instantly of Constable in
looking at it, any more than of Mesdag
and Israels; but there is a community of
spirit between them all. It is rather hard
to think immediately of Manet's wonder
ful woman in pink, with tbe green parrot
that drives the Philistine almost insane,
when confronted by Mr. Walton's tall
woman in yellows and browns.
Mr. Guthrie, who is the son of a Scotch
minister, is perhaps the most versatile.
Whether he chooses to paint a young girl
under the soft light of a lamp, or a monu
mental portrait of a man on horseback,
whether he uses the gay freshness of pastel
to express his quick impressions of life in
the streets of a city or a village, whether
he paints landscape or marines, he uses a
broad and vigorous brush Franz Hals
himself might have approved of. His
three portraits, all male, one of Sir Edwin
Dawes and two of two young boys, have
something absolutely simple and large in
their effective ana sober handling.
Anders Zom has a portrait of himself â
too clever and ultra modern. There is a
nude model in the background looking
out from under her hair; the side of the
figure is washed out in that flowing use of
paint Zom uses with much effect. It is a
big sketch and an interesting sketch â but
it remains a sketch â and not a representa
tive one from so good a painter.
Agashe, Binet, Miss Nourse, Gros â how
many painters show much reasonably
good work !
There are twenty Japanese landscapes
by Louis Dumoulin which actually reek of
Japan. The day has long gone by since
the artist painted his impressions of a
country from traditions in a comfortable
studio at home. All these laughing, chat
tering women, smooth-haired and dark,
with their shaking fans ana soft silken
costumes, the movement in the light
streets, the people who pass and meet ana
pass again â how it all vibrates with light
and life, and the charming gayety Picric
Loti and others have written of 1
There are pastels galore and there is sculp
ture â there is a head of Yeriaine, like the
head of a satyr, big, broad, ugly, aad and
wise, truthful as truth, most probably, and
as unreservedly brutal. The drawings of
Paul Renouard have the instantaneous
quality of a kodak â and such strength of
humor. His view of the English people
is as characteristically French as the late
drawings of English life by Charles Dana
Gibson have been characteristically Ameri
can.
With that generosity that fills us with
renewed respect we observe that an entire
room has been fitted out with the draw
ings of Edwin Abbey, prince of penmen.
Here we have Olivia and Ophelia, Hermi
one and Viola, Falstaff and King Hal,
Rosalind and Audrey and Touchstone â a
triumphal procession; never did the hum
ble medium of pen and ink work greater
wonders, lines as fine as spun silk, a spi
der-web network of shadow, and then the
quick, sharp stroke of an instrument that
has grown suddenly as hard and as as
sured as the steel point in the hand of an
etcher.
And all this while I have said nothing
of the old salonâ perhaps the less said the
better ! Van Dyck Brown.

There is a man in Paris who knows how
it feels to fall more than a mile through,
the air. He is Fernando Miranda, an artist
and sculptor. Mr. Miranda went up in a
balloon that collapsed. He luckily es
caped with nis life. The balloon ascent
in which Mr. Miranda took part was made
by a party of French scientists from Paris.
Mr. Miranda tells something of his own
sensations in the New York World in the
following language:
When I accepted an invitation to be
the artist of M. Wilfrid de Fonvieile's
party in the William Tell I little thoaght I
was being invited to fall over 6000 feet.
But neither did M. de FoÂ»vielie. It was
to me only an unexpected opportunity to
make a balloon ascension under the most
favorable auspices and in the very balloon
that carried Gambetta out of Paris during
the eiege in 1871. To him it was common
place.
Besides Captain de Fonvielle and his
assistant aeronaut, M. Chavautier, there
was a M. Bernard, inventor of a new
device for measuring the speed of ascent
and descent, and myself. Our purpose
was to take certain scientific observations
and conduct some experiments in electric
conditions at various altitudes.
The ascent was made on a beautiful May
forenoon at La yillette. M. de Fonvielle
had formally invited the special Embassa
dor of Annam, with bis suite, who were at
that time at the French capital on a diplo
matic mission. They attended in their
bright national costumes and contributed
a picturesque effect to the occasion.
When all was ready the loud, stern voice
of Captain de Fonvielle cried "All on
board!" Then I jumped into the willow
basket, trying to forget in that moment
all my connections on earth. As every
thing was in order the captain's voice was
again heard with the word "Lachez," or
"Let it go," and the balloon was free.
The monster balloon sailed majestically
up. The silence around us grew abso
lute. The place we left and our friends
became ever smaller, and tbe sweep of our
vision enlarged proportionately.
Shortly, in death-like silence, we reached
the lower ends of the clouds at the height
of 4500 feet above the delta formed by
the conjunction of the rivers Seine and
Marne.
These floating masses of imposingn g
grandeur were separated and inde
pendent, but moving in the same direc
tion, sometimes separating more or less
and sometimes closing up and uniting
themselves as immense chips of a vast
block.
This formation impressed me because
we are accustomed to see the clouds
from below, and in consequence we only
see the end behind which is hiding the
whole length of the cloud. To explain
more clearly, the cloud is like a Jong
stick, the length of which, when pointed
at us, we cannot see.
As we were ascending between those
gigantic chimneys of vapor and approach
ing their tops, it was interesting to ob
serve how tbe vapor became thicker. Soon
we reached the general level on which
they were swimming. This was at the
height of 9000 feet, or as high again as
when we entered their lower ends, which
would show that the vapory stalactites
were 4500 feet long.
The sky was of a deep blue, the air was
pure and sharp and the sun burned more
than nsual. Enormous dark openingy,
like tremendous abysses below, were often
seen on this vast field, produced by the
disintegration of the clouds or masses of
them in their course of floating.
Almost immediately I feit in my ears a
kind of persistent little pain, and I inci
dentally remarked it to M. de Fonvielle.
He said that he could not venture to go
higher without risk, as that was a sign of
extreme rarefication of the atmosphere,
and with that view he opened the valve
and we commenced our descent.
While in the fog on the descent I hap
pened to notice that the screw of M. Ber
nard's device was rotating so fast that I
thought that it was out of order. I called
the attention of the inventor and Captain
de Fonvielle to it. The captain ordered
us at once to throw out 'ballast, and we
emptied several sandbags, but the flying
sand went up and fell again upon us and
inside of our willow basket. We threw
out some cigarette papers, and up they
went like lightning.
I thought thai we were lost, and as I
was looking below and observing the hills
and the other objects growing rapidly
larger I had a queer, sickly feeling. I felt
I was going to certain death, and was sur
prised at my own calmness.
Fonvieile wai equal to the emergency,
and with perfect coolness ordered all the
ballast we had thrown out, bags, instru
ments and all, and us to at once climb up
and suspend ourselves from the hoop of
the balloon.
We managed to keep hanging from our
hoop till after Captain de Fonvielle threw
the anchor, which, fortunately, did not
take long to catch. The country people
who had seen us fall came to our assist
ance.
The rope was pulled by them until the
balloon was drawn down so that we could
jump out, but in the strong wind the bal
loon was plunging like an imprisoned bull,
and the process of lauding was not at all
comfortable. At last we succeeded in get
ting upon the solid earth, and I am sure
that I was not the last to leave the basket.
We were all sound, except for a few
bruises, and we held a consultation on
the probable cause of our fall. It appeared
that we had neglected the rope which goes
through the balloon for the purpose of
opening the valve, and that it had become
entangled with the other ropes of the
basket.
Thankful to have escaped we took the
train back to Paris, leaving M. Chavautier
in cbarge of the balloon.

A Bit of Gardening on a North Beach Hill.
Flower Gardens in t\ie City
Superir\ter\der\t McLaren or\ Sar\ Frar\cisco's
Floral Opportunities
One evening at the recent flower show
an amateur gardener from San Mateo,
with an assumed air of commiseration, re
marked : "You can't grow flowers to any
degree of perfection or with any satisfac
tion in San Francisco. Only some few
hardy things can stand the winds and foes.
You must get out of town, somewnere
around tbe bay, for flowers."
Now, this is a strange belief, and yet
it exists even among people who should
know more about Â»he wonderful flowers
and flower-gardens of the City by the
Golden Gate. The fact is, San Francisco
for many a long year has. been justly cele
brated as a city of beautiful flower
gardens, in which may be seen a variety
of blooms absolutely impossible in most
other cities of the world. John Mc-
Laren, superintendent of Golden Gate
Park, declares that if the taste for flowers
were cultivated, San Francisco would be
vastly improved In appearance.
Most people imagine that it is enough
to co into the garden now and again, and
then grow tired of attending to the flow
ers. Again, people who can afford to em
ploy men will not engage a competent
gardener. They leave all in the hands of
a man who knows nothing of the work he
is performing, and the result is about as
far removed from the ideal as one can im
agine.
In a conversation about flower culture
"in San Francisco Mr. McLaren gives many
valuable hints which, amateuri may smdy
with profit and pleasure. And then, with
the horticulture of Golden Gate Park as
an example, following it from month to
month, really pleasing results can be
reached by even the veriest tyro in the
City. The digging and "playing" round
the garden for an hour or two daily in the
fresh open air and sunshine will well re
pay in health the little distraction from
worldly cares.
"Flower gardening means work," was
Mr. McLaren's rather depressing opening
remark, "not a month and then grow tired
of it. Yon must Keep it ud all the year
round, for if once neglected the garden
goes behind. One thing against San
i-'rancisco is the shortness of the evenings,
that gives no time after the day's work to
puddle around in the flowers. It is differ
ent in other cities. People have their lit
tle gardens, window-gardens and flower
shows, and great interest is taken by ama
teurs. Here, of course, we have a horti
cultural society that holds exhibitions,
but there is not the general public interest
in it. A little more of that would be a
good thing in this City.
"I know of no city where such a variety
of flowers can be grown as San Francisco.
People told me when i started in here
You can't grow chrysanthemums; you
can't grow violets.' We have grown some
of the finest chrysanthemums in the park,
and violets will grow anywhere in San
Francisco. Still you very rarely see them
in the gardens. Over on Devisadero street,
the west side, near Turk, is an old cottage
where there are rows of pinks along the
entrance walk. I have noticed them par
ticularly, because they are as fine pinks as
I saw anywhere. .
"Roses. You can grow them as good
here as anywhere. If I take a month's
notice here I will guarantee to do itâ that
iÂ», these large hybrid roses."
He was asked what varieties he deemed
best suited to tbe local conditions.
"La Reine, La Marque," he replied. "No
where In the world are the La Marque
better than here. I have seen porches
covered with it â the finest white rose of its
character that grows. Other varieties for
San Francisco are Captain Christy, Her
Majesty, General Jacqueminot. The Gen
eral is a fine deep red. Also the Bourbon,
a deep dark red rose, free fr ;m mildew and
easily grown â a free bloomer. The Magna
Charta, another very fine rose, does better
here than I ever saw anywhere else. But
these require good stiff loam and generous
treatment.
"It does not do to starve roses. You
want good old rotten manure and liquid
guano or fertilizers during summer. Yon
can't cut roses off a bush twelve months in
a year without feeding. Soot in wÂ»ter is
good; a little sulphate of ammonia is a
good thing. Any of them with a little
ammonia is good.
"Hosing roses once a day, as most peo
ple do, will never give you good roses.
The great trouble, I find, is people pay for
taking care of their gardens and don't get
the right men. Those fellows don't know
enough to cut the grass. For instance, I
know a lady who bought 200 asters in pots.
They looked pretty, but in the < hands of
one of these fellows they died in a week.
They are working cheap but ruining the
gardens. They don't know the names -.'I
plants, much less the treatment neces
sary.
"Now for tea-scented roses, the hybrid
China rose. They do well in a light soil,
but must be enriched with decomposed
manure. You can no more starve roses
and have fine flowers than you can starve
a fine dog or horse and expect him to look
well.
"Pansies. They have a longer season in
San Francisco than in any of the outlying
districts, where the sun is hotter. Fog
and cool weather suit them admirably.
A small garden ought to get a fine
variety, the best named, for they are
cheap enough, and they should always be
bought from a reliable seedsman, who is
in the business to stay, not those Eastern
fellows, who send flower advertisements
out here. I speak from experience, and
most emphatically advise everybody to
buy seeds from the reliable seedsmen
right here in San Francisco, and not
mixed seeds, either. Pansies grow so well
here that with a good variety of seeds ama
teurs can get excellent results.
"The cineraria. This flower does bet
ter here than anywhere I know out
doors. There is less frost in San Fran
cisco than elsewhere in California, and
that gives this generous bloomer a chance
to live in the garden. In other places it is
a house plant, but here it comes in when
flowers are scaree â about Christmas â and
it is in bloom now. It seeds itself from
under the old plants, but it must have
shade, as the sun is not good for the cin
eraria. No special varieties are needed, as
they all give such a grand display of color.
"A very fragrant flower that luxuriates
here is the pink. It does as well as in tbe
country. I can give that lesson of the
Devisadero-street cottage, where there are
great bushes of pinks in all colors â from
white to dark red. It is better to grow
them every year from yountr plants. To
get a finer bloom, of course, yon must al
low fewer flowers to a plant. They ou^ht
to be grown from cuttings, not from seed.
Root them in sandy soil, in a shady place.
"Everybody ought to have a row of
violets, everybody. I don't care how
small the garden, even if it be only a box
in tbe window. Violets ought to be trans
planted every year, throwing the old roots
away and planting the young shoots after
blossoming and before growth commences,
that is about March, depending on tbe
season.
"Take the bulbous rootsâ tulips, hya
cinths, anemones and ranunculus; they
do splendidly here. They ought to be
planted about November 1 in light, rich
soil, the top of the bulb three inches beÂ«
low the surface and with an inch of sand
below to keep it from tbe manure. Anem
ones should not De covered more than one
inch.
"A beautiful bed can be had by planting
hyacinths and then carpeting the whole
with pansies. The hyacinths shoot up
and tbe pansies cover the ground. Pansies
can be grown from seed about August,
under glass, though they will come up in
a sheltered place. They should be watered
regularly, planted out when an inch high
in soft soil, about an inch apart, and
afterward put into their permanent quar
ters and thrown away every fall.
"The hydrangea, a perennial always in
flower, is another plant that luxuriates in
this atmosphere. One or two plants in a
shady corner is quite enough for a small
garden. They don't need much sun, and
grow without spading, only a little manure
oeing needed about them in spring, and
they are.very easily raised from cuttings.
"Fuchsias. Where can you grow them
like here? Of course, they have to be
kept out of the wind, for they must be
shaded if the flowers are to be good. Ail
varieties do well here from the old Castile.
I've seen old Venus de Medici here grow
ing six feet in a season. This is their
home along the coast.
"Asters, marigolds and the marguerites.
Where can you see finer specimens of these
flowers than in San Francisco? They are
grown without tronble in any soil.
"Dahlias do very well also, and are
easily grown. You cannot kill them. This
includes the hollyhocks. All the gerani
ums thrive in San Francisco, and are very
effective in small gardens.
"The pelargonium also, but it won't
stand water from overhead. It does not
like cold water every night, neither does
the geranium. They prefer a dry, warm
situation. Any old woman can grow them
from cuttings. Ferns grow splendidly in
the shade. There are three ferns in the
park rockery that would be worth $500
each in the East.
"There is nothing prettier than that
pink flower to be seen ail over the park
and out on Strawberry Hill. It grows in
the poorest soil with very little water, and
nothing can surpass it, the number of its
flowers. You can plant it any time of the
yearâ stick in a little piece where you
want.it to crow, on & dry, barren hillside,
sand or loam. Its name is the only thing
against itâ Mesenbryanthemum.
"With some trailing plants â the clematis
and passion vine for wallsâ you have a fair
list for a garden in San Francisco. If
more attention were given the gardens,
the appearance of the C;ty would be much
improved.'*

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 5, 1896.
THE NEW
WOMAN'S
GORSETS
"When women come into power," the suf
frage advocate was saying, "there won't be so
many round pegs in square holes." "You may
be sure of that," commented Portia, pausing
in her club-swinging. "There's too much in-;
justice in the world as it isâ too much forcing
of the man to fit the position," and she re
sumed her club practice.
We were in Portia's room and the suffrage
advocate had been rejoicing in our approach
ing emancipation. Portia is devoted to ath
letics. Shu has a horizontal bar in her room,
a stand of clubs and dumbbells and a con
trivance for exercising the muscles of tneback
of her neck. She "bikes" and "boxes" and
does quite wonderful things with a wand. She
took this wand down from its rack, having
concluded her gyrations with the clubs.
"Here's a new wrinkle," she said, and pro
ceeded to pasa it over her head and behind her
back.
Then she executed some sort of mysterious
maneuver by which she seemed to step over
herstif and finally crawled out from under her
own arms flushed but triumphant. "I can do
it backward, too," she explained, and she
bent over until she resembled a picture I once
saw in a doctor's book. It was labeled Apis
tholonos and made a deep impression upon
me, even after tbe doctor's explanation that it
was the picture of a woman in a fit of hys
terics. The leveraed performar.ee was as sue-
j Cessful as the initial one. Portia came Dp
| smiling but breathless, and as she appeared
I under the wand a loud snap sounded through
the room. Every woman oi us knew what had
haDpened, but Portia looked annoyed. "That't.
the third corset steel I've broken in a week,"
she said discontentedly. ' 'Why don't you wear
a paten*, waist?" asked the suffrage advocate;
"they're quite as much support ad the corset"
"I've tried them," was the reply, "but the
buttons fly in every direction when I exercise,
and then one's dresses never do sit quite so
well over them." "But," I continued to say,
"isn't it rather inconsistent in a devotee of
athletics to wear corsets at all?" "Oh, I don't
wear them at all tight. I can put both hands
in mine after they're laced about the waist.
I couldn't get along without them."
How many women have I heard make this
triple assertion?
I sought a well-known gymnasium in
structor.
"Oh, yes," he said, "women are coming to
me every day for practice. Some of my pupils
are doing splendid work. Talk about the
emancipation of womanâ there's only one way
leading to it. Give a woman a sound body and
a bicycle and she'll emancipate herself and all
the rest of the race."
The professor was waxing enthusiastic.
"Why," he exclaimed, "if the last three gener
ations of women had been healthy, athletic
specimens of their kind, we should never have
had the present spectacle of a discontented,
complaining sex, demanding their rights and
wanting to do "verything that men da Women
don't need tbe ballot half a- much as they
need good blood, healthy bodies and well
developed systems. Physical culture is giving
them these."
"Then I suppose you agree with Rabbi Voor
sanger," I said, "that three generations of
women without corsets will do as much as the
ballot, for woman and the race?"
The professor's face clouded. "Do you
know," he began, confidentially, "that's the
greatest tronble I have with my pupils? They
come to me full ot enthusiasm, and seem to
think physical culture will work wonders for
them, but while they're willing enough to put
on bloomers they want to swing clubs, climb
ropes, go up ladders and fence and box while
they are wearing corsets. I tell them
gymnastic exercises cannot be successfully, or
even safely, taken in the things, but they do
not believe me. Why, I kuow a teacher of
what she calls 'harmonic gymnastics' who
actually wears them, and aavices her pupils
to do so. Now, I believe that, even Handi
capped by corsets and toothpick shoes, our
women are the better for exercise, but
why, look here," and he produced a picture.
"I wish," he said, "that the Roctgen ray could
give us a picture of a 'corset liver,' but we're
not far euough along for that. But see what
our modern shoe is doing to the bones ot the
foot. Do you suppose the owner of such a foot
is going to have a 'good understanding' of the
laws of health or of anything else? The body
is so accommodating. It responds delieht
f ully to our attempts to improve it, and It is
fatally responsive to our persistent determina
tion to injure it by improper dressing. There
is too much forcing of the body to fit its cover
ings."
I was startled at this phrase in the profes
sor's mouth. Portia had said, "There is too
much forcing of the man to fit the position,"
and we are promised that there will be less of
this when woman has the ballot. Is it pos
sible that that magic bit of paper is going to
alter human nature, as exemplified for genera
tions by womankind?
To be sure, this is aside from the question.
There can be no doubt, however, but that the
friends of physical culture are right in the
main proposition. Good blood and healthy
bodies among our women are going to do more
for the race than any other physical or intel
lectual iorce.
The trouble is that, like all new ideas, there
is danger of the pursuit of health and a sym
metrical development of the bcdy becoming a
fadâ at least among women. The question of
how and when to exercise is largely an indi
vidual one; but, as is usual, many wholesale
solutions of the problem are offered us, and we
have "systems" and "no systems" galore.
Some of these advocate all sorts of apparatus,
others decry apparatus as of all devices most
WE WERE IN PORTIA'S ROOM."
dangerous. Amid the clamor of many voices
she is a wise woman who pursues a medium
course.
Naturally the woman who would take exer
cise, in these days, thinks first of all of the
omnipresent wheel. Seeing the hundreds of
happy riders who throng our rouds and path
ways these summer evenings, one cannot
blame her. But in the very fascination of the
wheel lies its danger. For ninety-nine women
out of a hundred the tendency is to overdo;
to ride too fast and too far; to ride until arms
are numb and spines grow sensitive from the
vibration inevitable even with the perfected
pneumatic tires and saddles. Wire and steel
in rapid motion will maintain a steady vibra
tion. As well say water will not run down
hill as to affirm the contrary, and the tendency
of too-long-continued endurance of this vibra
tion is over-stimulation, and consequent ex
haustion of nerves. We are apt to forget, in
the sense of power and freedom we get from
the "silent, shining safety," that the motion
which seems so easy, so much a part of our
own natural power, is, after all, foreign to us,
and therefore to be indu'.eed in moderation.
Perhaps of all modern physical culture fads
for women the one that In a few years will
have resulted in the most mischief is running.
It is in great vogue just now, and advocates of
this form of exercise for women meet all criti
cism by triumphant allusions to the fleet
footed females among the lower animals. But,
beyond a certain limit, which is soon reacned,
analogies drawn from this source are danger
ous. Those who are wont toattempt to regulate
man's life by laws that work for good among
the lower orders forget, among other essential
differences between the human and the brute
creations, that man, in the course of the ages,
has acquired an upright position. This ac
quired habit of standing erect has given him
transcendent power among the creatures, but
it has also modified all other habits of his life.
The wonder is not that he does it so well, but
that he does it at all. Mechanically con
sidered, running lor the human creature is a
continuous lalliug. It is a severe strain upon
the buniun physique, ana women are even
less fitted to endure it than are men. Most of
us know it. We run under protest, not be
cause we do it awkwardly, but because we can
not do it comfortably, and the undoubted
hampering of our skirts is not the only rea
son. It is well to know the principles of run
ning; how to perform the feat with the least
waste oi lorce and with the greatest degree of
skill; but it is a form of exercise that women
should use sparingly.
As a matter of fact moderation is a quality
that should enter into all exercise, but per
haps the first essential to a successful search
for health through physical culture is rational
dress. There is no better form of exercise
known than deep, systematic, frequently prac
ticed normal breathing, but it is the experience
of physieiÃns.!inil of cymnnstic teachers alike
that the averaee woman does not know
how to breathe normally; in fact, is unable to
do so while wearing the almost omnipresent
corset.
But by the intelligent observances of a few
simple exercises even the average woman, if
she is inclined, may arrive at a very fair de
gree of physical development without ever
having been inside a gymnasium.

BAIRD'S
ADVICE ON
HURDLING
Let us talk now about "hurdling." To be a
hurdler one must have a variety of accom
plishments; it is necessary to be a quick
starter, a fast sprinter, a good broad jumper, a
good high jumper, and to possess great strength
and endurance.
Since writing about "snrint-running," in
which I represented four different methods of
starting, the great intercollegiate games have
been run off in New York; and 1 was much
struck with the fact that every man of conse
quence in the sprint runs used the crouch
start. As before explained, this is performed
by placing the left toe on or a little behind the
scratch line; place the knuckles of the first
two fingers and the tip of the thumb of each
band on the mark, which will bring you into a
crouching position, the right toe about eight
een inches in the rear.
Precision must be the successful hurdler's
watchword. So many steps are taken from the
start and the fir.Â«t hurdle is reached. Then
two things must be accomplished: the
jumper must not catch his toe on the hurdle,
neither must he rise so far above it as to waste
his strength. Here the happy medium must
be attained to perfection or the other man
will win. Now, to take a hurdle properly is a
A. F. COPELAND, CHAMPION HURDLER.
Record: 120 yards, ie sec; running broad jump, 23 ft. 3 1-5 inches.
great art, and It is a combination of running
high and running broad jumping. Tbe foot
must touch in exactly the right spot, so many
feet and inches from each flight, and there
must be just so much vital energy expended.
There are very few healthy young men that
cannot clear 3 feet 6 inches with ease; but
to do it ten times with an aggressive com
petitor at your shoulder is quite another
thing. Fifteen feet for a broad jump is not
much, but a succession of them is quite an
other thing. To clear a hurdle under full
speed requires a rare combination of the ut
most caution and tbe greatest daring.
When the leap has been taken the land is not
made as in abroad jump â all in a heap; on the
contrary, the utmost exertion must be made to
strike on the left foot, and instantly get to
running. There must be no jerk, no halt, no
weakness. Everything depends on the run
ner resuming his stride as though he was in
a hundred-yard race. Having resumed his
stride there are usually three steps taken be
tween each hurdle, and of course they must
be put in with all dispatch.
The position of body and limbs while going
over the gate is also a vital point. The arms
should keep with tne legs, Â»nd be given such a
violent swing and jerk as to be of great as
sistance in helping the jumper in his flight.
Of course the hurdle must be taken face on, as
any deviation would throw the body out of
true and lead to serious consequences. The
right foot is under the body and kept as close
to the thigh as possible. The left foot is ad
vanced and considerably extended; the body
almost erect, the arms in such a position as to
best assist in the flying motion. Most hur
dlers use the right foot to spring from and the
left to alight on.
Up to half distance the race is usually easy,
but at the fifth or sixth hurdle the strain be
gins, and It is in this part of the race that en
durance is useful, not to say necessary.
Therefore, an ambitious hurdler should en
deavor to acquire endurance as one of the es
sentials in the class of race in question.
If I were to take up hurde-racing I would
not begin by running over the flights. I would
first acquire the quick start, and learn to get
into running with all possible speed. I would
jumD frequently on the springboard at the
gymnasium, to gain strength in my calves;
practice high jumping, taking pains to clear
the bar with a straight bound and an erect
body, watching my feet to keep from striking.
Then I would practice a little broad jumping,
but avoid landing in any other way than on
one foot, continuing tbe running at once. If
you find that your speed is greater than your
endurance, then practice to "stay."
It is not an uncommon thing to find an
athlete who is a superior hurdler but who is a
third-rate man in short-distance running and
starting, so do not be discouraged if your
neighbor runs right away from you at the
short distance. You may find that before the
race is far along you may be creeping up to his
shoulder.
Many persons are doubtless under the Im
pression that to be a successful hurdler re
quires a trainer, an instructor, and the very
best facilities in existence. This is not so In
fact; for some of the best athletes this coast
ever produced were self-tanght and self
trained. This, however, is particularly true in
regard to hurdle racing; and enthusiasts of a
few years ago can remember how a young man
from the University of California, aimust alone
and almost unaided, established a best on
record in the world at the coasi championship
gamesâ ls?i seconds. This illustration is ad
vanced to show athletes in general, and
hurdlers in particular, tnat, after all, ambi
tion and industry are the great forces in the
world of athletics; and properly applied great
results can sometimes be obtained from the
most unpromising materials.
Let us see what is to be gained by being a
good hurdler. First of all, if you become a
quick starter it will impart a quickness of
thought that is inspiring, transforming a de
liberate, not to say poky, boy into a prompt,
active man. The mind as well as the body
will feel the effect in greater alertness. To be
brisk in body without nervousness is greatly
to be desired; and it is this very quiet starting
that assists in curing nervousness, for the pis
tol-firer will not permit any unsteadiness on
the mark if he understands his business.
Then the last few hurdles, the test of en
durance. How it does call upon bis muscle
and his vitality to hold out under the strain!
How the limbs get loggy, and how the sinews
achel Mot only is it a test of physical en
durance, but mental as well. Let it be dis
tinctly remembered that if a boy is wanting in
pluck there is no school for curing him of that
deficiency, or correcting the habit of giving
up, like a race. To see a man passing yon, to
feel a prize slipping away from your very
grasp, the cheers or the frowns of friendsâ as
the case may beâ and above all the anxious
eyes of one in particular, and the desire for
her approving smile, is any experience quali
fied to put grit and nerve into a man more
than a hard race?
A case of great improvement occurs to me.
I once knew a yonng man who had trouble
with his eyesâ so much so that it became neces
sary for him to wear colored glasses. More
over, when I saw him he did not look well; his
complexion was not healthy and he moved
about languidly. The trouble spread to his
mental faculties, for his look was downcast and
his voice subdued. I met him on the train
going out to the grounds, ana I was struck with
his appearance. He said he was going to try
running to see if it would do him any good.
I lost sight of him for about three months,
until one day I attended a set of games. To
my surprise this young man won the 75-yard
handicap over a field of twenty-five or thirty,
and when I met him after the games I scarcely
knew him; his eye was clear and bright; his
head erect and his step elastic and vigorous,
and all this was accomplished by three mont.'.s'
exercise. George D. Baikd.
THE BOY AND I
The Boy and I have grown up together. I
had quite a head start, which has given ma's,
better opportunity to watch the Boy develop.
We've been pretty good friends. All through
the time when I wheeled him out and quau
reled with the other girls over the beauty ol
our respective charges, the days when I had to
stand his little boy-tyranny and pick up his
playthings, the time I shook the nonsense out
of the larger boy who harassed his path to
school, through the period when he would
swear, the time he turned white and sick from
looking at a cigar, the epoch of leaving school
and beginning work, up to the present day, all
the time that I have carried him about in my
heart and in my head, waking and sleeping,
the Boy and I have had a kind of liking for
each other.
The Boy thinks I'm a pretty good sort of big
sister to have around; a nice person to get a
fellow out of a tight place without preaching
too much, and handy to have on general prin
ciples. He often asks my advice, and I have
known him to act upon it. I know he thinks
there is no girl brighter than his big sister in
most things, but I've lately found out some
thing I don't like.
The Boy won't give a fig for my political
opinion.
Perhaps it is partly my fault I've never
argued with him much, because I didn't
think it worth while. When he aired his cal
low ideas I smiled and went on frying my own
fish.
He was only a "kid."
Now it has dawned upon me that next year
the Boy will be 21 and his youthful opinions
will influence his country's weal or woe to the
extent of one vote.
Next year I will b^ 21 (and then some), with
opinions as strong and I hope more mature
than his, but I can't vote. My country must
somehow shift along without my ballot, and a
poor shift it is too. %
I've paid taxes ten years. .The Boy never
paid a cent. I have studied the constitution
of the United States and that of California
until I can repeat whole sections. I know the
Boy can't do as much. I've read history, an
cient ana modern, a hundred to his one, and I
have all my life kept up with the current
events. Maybe I have neglected baseball,
racing and prize-fighting, but I know about
even them. I can do every kind of work the
Boy can do, and besides I can extract the cube
root of a polynomial and make good bread.
I have to obey every law that he obeys, but I
am not competent to help make them.
It isn't any use to tell me that the Boy repre
sents me and the other women of the house;
he doesn't do any such thing.
I won't be represented by the Boy. Not be
cause his vote will not be an honest one and
fairly intelligent, but because it is his vote,
and he will have all he can do to represent
himself.
The Boy likes a good dinner; still enough for
him and me, too, would be more than he could
digest. I wonder if when the Boy is judged
for his sins he will have to represent mine,
too. Poor Boyl Suppose he marries and has
his wife to represent, besides his sisters and
his mother and then the possible daughters.
Could you lecommend a tonic for the Boy?
I don't think with the Boy in many things*
He lacks tbe ten years of labor among the
people that have changed my Idea 6 materially.
He lacks the sorrows and the losses'that have
taken the gloss off much that was bright and
that have shown new beauty in what was
dark.
He will grow, I grant, and step for step; so
will I.
One night the Boy was doing a little spout
ing. He thought I didn't care to vote because
I hadn't said much in his hearing.
"Nice women didn't want to vote," the Boy
said, "and the rest had no business.
Things wouldn't be any better if a lot of them
voted as their husbands told them."
"Well," I said, "Boy, we'll admit for the
sake of 'argument that things would be no
better if women voted â even say things would
be worse. I tell you in the face of that, if
woman wants to vote it is her right. If she
doesn't want to no one will make her, but the
right is hers just the same."
The Boy was thunderstruck. He never
tnouKht I cared so much. I do-=tÂ»re, and from
that time on I talked it up on all occasions. I
think the Boy sees both sides of it now, though
he is still a benighted male.
The Boy and I are the average man and
woman, and here are some of our arguments.
"Women have a house to attend to."
Sure. And men have a business to attend to.
Women, with housework to do, have oceans of
time to think. If they haven't sensible things
to think of, they will think of foolish things.
Much of the labor of housekeeping is mechani
cal. I can wash dishes, make beds, sweep,
hang up clothes and iron, all without any deep
thought for the work itself; my hands know
how without my head. Peeling potatoes is
not a work that requires concentrated atten
tion, and I think I could wash the front steps
nicely with my mind on political economy.
There are times when I can't divide my facul
ties thus â for instance, when I make jelly or
boil eggs. The Boy doesn't mix politics witk
the figures he adds.
Then think of the long hours most women
spend sewing and mending in the quiet after,
noon. They can do more thinking than a
whole session of Congress. I have gone to
every political meeting this year, and the Boy
cannot say his meals are ever late or hurried.
When the Boy said women were not strong I
looked into his eyes and laughed. He knew
without words that I was laughing at the
weakness of a woman who had supported a
home all these years and could walk and wheel
and eat right along with him. As far as brute
strength goes he could break me in two with
one hand. If that is the qualification, Mr.
Sharkey must have two votes.
"Women are ignorant of the affairs of the
Nation."
Many of them are. Why should they care?
They don't study what they cannot use. Give
them a nation ana see them dig into it-= affairs,
deeper mayhap than their brothers wi6h them
disturbed.
"Some women will always be ignorant."
Now, isn't that too badl Poor, lonesome
mortal. Of course we can never find a man to
match her. All men are wiseâ born so. They
don't have to learnâ none remain ignorant or
bigoted. When a European pauper takes out
his naturalization papers he is straightway
transformed into an American of education
and culture. But you can't do that with his
wife. <
"Women are Impressibleâ easily Influenced
by the talk of another."
Oh, Boy, Boy, I fear it is bo. Why could we
not be independent thinkers like men? The
stump-speaker never influences a man (ha
must be talking to women); crowds are never
swayed as one man; men never follow their
party leaders blindly; but we might, poor
gelatinous creatures. With diminished head
I pass on to the next.
"Women are not practicalâ they are extrava
gant; they do not look deep."
Right there, Boy. I object There isn't a
minister of finance in the United States or
Great Britain that is equal to your own
mother. There isn't a male eye can look work
over so swiftly and point out the dirt left in
corners. There isn't one man can give one
glance and say "shoddy" with her certainty.
A man would never take time to go over ac
counts to see where that extra 10 cents or 10,
-000,000 went, nor would he have the firmness
to demand that it be put back. She'd happen
around to see what sort of stuff a contractor
was rutting in, and what a noise she'd make if
she found she was being cheated. No, no,
Boy, her whole life is a lesson of economy. In
fact she'd be an awful bother to some men
with her habit of looking into things, and her
femininely unreasonable expectation of geU
tini; something for her money.
"Some women do not want to vote."
I know of some men who don't want to
smoke. Boy, but wouldn't you object vigor
ously if they tried to abridge your cigar ? The
woman who doesn't want to vote vexes me.
Not because she doesn't want to, but because
she thinks it is any of her business if I want to.
It is no use arguing. I know lam as good a
citizen as the Boy, and I want to fill my place.
I do not want it as a favor granted by the Boy.
It is my right.
Oh, how I detest the man who says In a pa
tronizing way "he'd be willing to let women
vote if they wanted toâ poor things, they
would soon get tired of It"
One average woman would make three of
him mentally and morally. It is "no fair."

ter sell his'o, an' a bunch ob paper caps
foh a dime. Say, mammy, will yer?"
"Go 'way, chile; I am' got no dime,"
replied mammy, who was busy hanging
out her week's washing on a grapevine,
wbicn was stretched across the yard in lieu
of a clothesline.
"But hit's de Fou'th ob Ju.'y, termorrer,
an' I am' got nuffln' to shoot wid," per
sisted Tobias. "You might dcs gimme er
dime, mammy."
Mammy shook her turbaned head.
"Shain't," she uttered with discourag
ing taciturnity.
"Gimme er nickel, den," urged Tobias,
coaxinecly. "You got er nickel, mammy,
caze I done seed one in yo' money-pus."
"You neber mm' whut 1 got in my
money, pus," retorted mammy, with a
couple of clothespins in her mouth. "I
ain't got no nickel ter spar', Fou'th or no
Fou'th."
"But I want some fi '-crackers, ef I cam'
hab er bean-shooter," whined Tobias.
Say, mammy, why couldn' you gimme
er nickel?"
"You Tobe Johnsing, ef you don' quit
a-pesterin' de life outer me I'se gwine gib
you de bes' trouncin' you eber had in all
yo' bo'n aaya!" threatened mammy, with
rising wrath. "Ain't I done tole you I
didn' hab no nickel ter spar'? You
liiink I'se made out of nickels? Go 'long
iiiterde house, now, an 1 stir dat coffee
whut's a-parchin' in de stove oven."
And Tobias sulkily obeyed.
When his mother entered the kitchen a
short time afterward he picked up his bat
tered bat and slipped stealthily away.
"I'll hab dat bean-shooter an' deni fi'
crackers yit, see if I don't," ne muttered,
determinedly, as he crept nimbly between
two rails of the worm fence which inclosed
Mammy Johnsing'a little "truck patch"
and trudged sturdily down the road, as if
be had a definite purpose in view.
He stopped suddenly, however, aa he
caught sight of "Miss Pinkertoirs boy,"
prowling through the underbrush, a short
distance away.
"Hi, Tobel" called the boy. "There's a
rabbit down here in the brush pile. Come
on, quick, an' let's run it out?"
And, for the time being. Tobe forgot all
about his disappointment, in the excite
ment of the chase.
Mammy, in the meanwhile, had ground
some of the freshly parched coffee, and,
after refreshing herself with a cup of the
cheering beveiage, her heart relented and
she reproached herself for not acceding to
her son's request.
"Spec' I had oughter gib dat chile some
pocket change foh de Fou'th ob July,
wbut our ancisters done fit foh," she re
flected. "I hate dem snappin' pistils an
u'-crackers wussen pizon, but hit ain't
nuttin' mo'n right foh young folks to hab
tiere fun. Reckon I'll hunt out er nickel
foh Tobe, an' s' prise him when he comes
in."
And, with a benevolent smile on her
sable face, she reached for her pocket
book, which she kept in a cigar-box on
the wooden mantel, beside the eight-day
clock.
But the smile quickly faded from her
countenance and gave place to a look of
consternation.
"Lan gakes!" she exclaimed. "Whar
dat nioney-Du's' at? Somebuddy done stole
hit, sho's yo' bo'u. Now, whut I gwine
ter do foh fiou' an' coffee, I'd like ter
know?"
In the desperate hope that she might
have overlooked it, mammy took the dox
on her lap and was fumbling among its
contents, when the door opened softly and
Tobe peered cautiously within.
Rolling his eyes in eager scrutiny for a
moment, and seeming to be well satisfied
with the result of his observation, he crept
as silently as a shadow into the room, and
tiptoed across to his mother, who sat with
her back toward him.
"Hit suttiniy is gone," muttered
mammy, in a tone of despair, when
"Snap! bang!" sounded suddenly in her
ear, and with a wild shriek of terror she
sprang from her chair, while the cigar-box
dropped unheeded to the floor.
Looking about to discover the cause of
her fright, she at last espied Tobe, con
vulsed with laughter, in the very act of
putting a ires'\ cap on the toy pistol which
gleamed in his hand.
His laughter was not of long duration,
however, for with a yell which would
have done credit to a Kickapoo Indian,
mammy swooped down on her offspring,
seized him by the neckband of his cotton
shirt and gave him a woful shaking.
"You youn? riporate," she cried, wrath
fully, "if I don' lick you good hit's cSsze I
done forgot how!"
"Ouch !" howled the culprit, "lenime
go!" But mammy only shook the harder.
"You owdaciou* youne wiper!" she
shrieked, giving bim a cuff which elicited
a whole gamut of howls, "whar's dat
money-pus at, whut you done stoled
from yo' po' oie mammy?"
"800-hoo, I neber stoled no money
puV 1" wailed Tobias, dodging an im
aginary blow which he fancied was aimed
at him. "i neber teched yo' money-pus!"
But mammy was still skeptical.
"Whar you git dat pistil at, ef yo' neber
tuck dat pus ?" she demanded, accusingly.
"Hit am' my pistil," protested the vic
tim, ruefully. "Miss Pinkerton's boy he
done loaned hit ter me, ter show you, so
you'd gimme dat 'ar dime, an' â dere's yo'
money-pus now, mammy, ober yander on
de winder-sill!"
"What dat you say?" gasped mammy.
"On de winder-sill? So hit is, cbileâ so
hit is! I 'member, now, I done laid hit
down when dat 'ar chicken-hawk got atter
de white pullet. Mammy's Dow'ful sorry
she done shuck you, honey, an' heah a
nickel foh dat, an' anudder foh yo' hon
esty."
"Hooray!" shouted Tobias, his injuries
forgotten. "Two nickels! Is you done
gib 'em bofe ter me, mammy, sho' an'
suttin?"
"Sho' an' suttin," repeated mammy,
emphatically.
And, with a beaming countenance,
Tobias rushed off to confide his unex
pected good fortune to his friend and
crony, "Miss Pinkerton's boy."
Mammy watched him with a smile,
though she felt a twinge of compunction
as she thought of the "shucking" so re
cently administered.
She soothed her conscience, however, by
telling herself it had not been altogether
undeserved.
"Ef he didn't stole de money, be skeered
me half out'n my wits, a-poppin' dat pistil
in de back ob my haid. de young scaper
grace!" she reflected. "'Sides which,
many's de time he 'zarved a lickin' an'
neber got bit, so dis 'un won' no mo'n even
up."
And with this cheerful view of the mat
ter, mammy dismissed it from her mind
at once and forever.

"Look at the donkey with his tail on
fire!" cried Willy, running pell-mell into
the house, in a high state of excitement.
"What's the matter with Willy,
mamma?" asked Elsie. "He's crazy."
"You just go there," said Willy, point
ing to the window.
The whole family ran to the window and
looked across the bare, bro-vn old hills,
covered with sagebrush. There, sure
enough, just disappearing over the top of
the ridge, was a donkey with his tail on
fire. At the same time they glanced across
Pussy's Toilette.
to a hieh hill where the miners hoisted
the gold ore out of the ground, and saw
volumes of white smoke curling up into
the sky.
"It's a volcano," snouted Elsie clapping
her bands. "I know, 'cause I saw one in
my geography."
But Mr. and Mrs. Ellis looked very
serious.
"The mine's aSre," exclaimed Mr. Ellis
suddenly. And without another word he
snatched up his hat and rushed out of the
house.
The children looked op at their mother
with open mouths.
"And the poor donkey," said Mrs. Ellis,
"must have got caught in the fire and run
out through the tunnel."
Two hours later Willy was on his way to
the mouth of the tunnel to see if he
couldn't pet a ride into the mine on a mule
team. He was walking alongside the
great shed where the gold ore is hauled
from the tunnel to the stampmill, when a
really curious sight met his eyes. He

Elsie. "You can't fool me."

was a big fellow and looked terribly sad. j
He was leaning up against the wall, look- j
ing awful weak in the knees, and he was
crying, too. Yes, sir. Tears were drop
ping from his eyes and little sparks from
the end of his tail, where it was burnea."
"That was the same donkey we saw on
the hill," interrupted Elsie, her eyes as
big as saucers.
"I kno* both of 'em," continued Willy, j
"The outside donkey was old McQuaia's
Jenny, and the one inside was big Jack,
that's worked in the mine for ten years.
And this is what they said.
" 'You're looking pretty rocky this morn
ing,' said Jenny, poking her head into
the sbed. 'What's the matter?'
"Jack gave a big snorting sigh and shook !
his tail sadly.
" 'Well, I guess you'd feel rocky. I got
burned out, that's what's the matter. My
tail caught fire, and I had to run like the
deuce to put it out. I tried water first; ij
ducked my bead in a barrel in the tun

" 'You put your bead in to put your tail
out. That's funnyâ ha! ha!' And Jenny j
laughed a great coarse mule laugh.
" 'I don't see anything funny about it,'
said Jack. 'And, besides, I nearly got
killed with gas. But I saved the mine.'
" 'How was that?'
" 'Well, it was this way. You see, there
was no watchman underground, and they
left me hooked up to a car way down in

lantern hanging around my neck. Finally
I heard a crackling noise, and I thought it
was about time to get out and give the
alarm. I made one big lunge and
upset the car, which got unhooked from j
my Harness. Then I ran straight into j
some burning timbers."
" 'Foolish thing to do,' said Jenny.
" 'Well, I couldn't see where the smoke
was coming from, and I didn't know where
1 was going. While I was plunging around
in the dark I felt my tail burning, and I
knew the only thing to do was to run as
fast as I could to keep the fire from spread
ing over the rest of my body. So I started
out in the other direction. It was terriDle.
I couldn't see anything. But I just kept
shouting, "The mine's afire! the mine's
afire I" and ran as fast as ever I could.
41 'Finally 1 eot through the smoke. I
saw a little speck of light in the distance
and knew it was the mouth of the tunnel.
But I kept right on running through the
town and over the hill, shaking my burn
ing tail and calling out louder and louder,
"The mine's afire." Then I lay down to
rest myself. By and by some boys came
and patted me and said: "Jack, why don't
you put your tail out?" I told them I was
too tired. They said, "Poor Jack!' and
stamped a little on my tail and put it out.
" 'Then they led me back here and tied
me up. Oh, I tell you I'm tired of work
ing in that dark old mine, groping around
in the dim light of candles, bumping my
head on the roof of tunnels and wearing
my ears out, and getting my feet wet
besides. And nobody pays any attention
to me. or gives me any thanks. 1 just get
pushed away into odd corners, and have to
wait there patiently till the cars fill up. 1
" 'Your ears always were too long,' said
Jenny, spitefully.
"Jack began to cry harder, and wiped the
tears away with his ear.
" 'You must have rather a combustible
tail,' Jennie went on.
" 'I don't know what you mean by that
big word,' sobbed Jack, 'but I guess if
you were in my fix, you wouldn't feel like
hearing such remarks!'
"Just then some miners came along and
led Jack away."
"Where did they take him?" asked
| Elsie, drying her eyes.
"I don't know," said Willy.
But it was rumored all over town the
next day that Big Jack had really saved
the. mine. As soon as he had given the
alarm the burning timbers were put out
and the foreman of the mine decided that
Jack should be rewarded.
He was led away to a vacant, grassy lot
with a barn on it, wnere he lives to this
day, just eating grass and hay and sleep
ing and doing nothing. People come and
look at him over the fence, where a big
sign is nailed:
"This is Big Jack, who gave the alarm
of fire and saved the Kosedale mine."

ELECTRICITY IN
MODERN WARFARE,
Is it Destined to Revolution
ize Military and Naval
Science?
Speculation Based Upon the Swiss
Discovery of " Charmed
Bullets."
Engineer W. Stuart -Smith Discusses
the Matter for the Benefit of
"Call" Readers.
The influence of electricity upon modern
naval and military methods is a subject of
wide speculation at the present time. In
some quarters it is thought that the subtle
fluid will work a revolution in methods of
warfare. The particular phenomenon
upon which such speculation is based was
observed by a committee of the Swiss Fed
eral Rifle meeting in summing up the re
sults of the practice shooting of the troops
at Winterthur. This committee noticed
that nearly all the shots tired from the
richtside of the range had hit the target
to the right of the bullseye, while those
tired from the left side had, with an
equally singular persistency, hit the left
half of* the target. The great number of
men who took part in the shooting pre
cluded the idea that this singular result
couid have been due to the personal pecu
liarities of the soldiers, for while it may
be true that one marksman habitually
shoots too high, another too low or to the
right or left of tne mark, with a large
number ot individuals firing at the same
target these idiosyncrasies of marksman
ship would be set off one against the other
and the misses wonld be fairly distributed
on all sides of the bullseye. It became
necessary, therefore, to find an extraneous
and single cause for the remarkable uni
formity with which the bullets appeared
to have been deflected from their proper
course.
The wind could not have produced the
effect noted, since, in the first place, allow
ance had doubtless been made by the
riflemen for deflection by aerial currents,
and on the other hand, if the wind had
diverted the missiles the deflection would
luive been in the same direction on both
of the rani;e. An examination of the
steel-cad bullets extracted from the tar
gets disclosed the fact that they had be
come magnetic, and this led the commit- j
tee to enteitain the theory that the phe
n menon observed by it might have been
due to electric influence exerted by the
larg',- number of telegraph and telephone
wires which run along both sides of the
range at Winterthur. Further experi
ment at the ranees of Thun and Berne
proved this theory to be correct, and the
remarkable discoveries made at these trials
rmiy effect another complete change in
military tactics. The following account
of one of the experiments is given by the
Journal de Geneve:
"At Thun. authorities established parallel
with the lifle range, at a distance of a little
more than forty yards, an electric current
of 8000 volts, carried along lour steel
cables. With a view of tracing the whole
effect, paper circlets were placed at inter
vals of ten yard" along the line of fire.
The first experiments were made with the
Swiss model rifles of 1889. With this the
influence of the eiectric current was at
once apparent. In a distance of 260 yards
tie bullet took a lateral deviation of j
twenty-four yards, and after that the curve j
o: the trajectory was still more marked.
The second experiments were made with
the Japanese 3.cJmru rifle of Colonel Ya
niagata, and they were still more decisive,
the bullet being rapidly attracted to the
electric wires and following their course
with absolute servility. Further attempts
were made with artillery. The range
selected was one of 3000 yards. Two
hundred vans in front of tae targets, but
forty yards to the side, was placed the
electric battery. Every shot was diverted
by its influence far to the side of the target
âto be exact, ilie deviation was one of 14
degrees."
It is interestine to note some of the re
markable conclusions drawn by Eastern
writers from those results. One of them
says, for instance, that "a dynamo or ac
cumulator of the requisite power placed on
the flank of a com pan y of infantry would
insure the men complete immunity from
the fire of small arms within a range of
500 yards and upward; for all of the bul
lets would be diverted toward the mag
netic field created by the electric current
from the dynamo or accumulator. Simi
larly, artillery tire could be rendered
harmless at a ranee of 1000 yards and
over. It would, perhaps, be premature
to assert that the consequence of this
discovery will be the doom of the mod
ern small-bore military rifle, with its
steel-jacketed bullet, for it might be
practicable to inclose the leaden missile
in hard bronze or some other metal not
affected by magnetism. Artillery wouid
probably remain destructive enough on
the battle-field by the use of explosive
shells. It is in naval warfare that the
discovery may have the most important
consequence?. In Conan Doyle's 'Stark
Munro Letters' the hero is credited with
an invention to render a warship immune
from the shots of an enemy by placing
electric accumulators at its stem and stern.
The idea was to deflect steel projectiles by
magnetism, just like the Swiss military
authorities have in fact succeeded in do
ing. It would certainly be a revolutionary
departure if instead of incasing our battle
ships in heavy bombproof armor we could
encompass them with an impalpable mag
netic veil which would compel the great
armor-piercing steel projectiles to pass
harmlessly by."
A representative of The Call inter
viewed W. Stuart-Smith, electrical and
mechanical engineer. United States navy
(retired), on the subject of the electrical
influence above mentioned. Mr. Smith
smiled broadly as he read the Eastern
newspaper deductions. His own views
are valuable as coming from a recognized
authority on these matters. "The experi
ments made by the Swiss military au
thorities," said he, "while of considerable
interest from a scientific standpoint, will
hardly result in the adoption of methods
for rendering the firing of small arms and
great guns bo ineffective that these
weapons will be relegated to the military
scrapheap, and Â£he battles of the future
become hand-to-hand conflicts as in days
of old. A very superficial examination of
the conditions prevailing during the tests
will show what is required in order that
deflection of the shot may be produced.
The reports of the test state distinctly that
long circuits carrying heavy currents were

The charming decorative drawing entitled "The Young St. Cecilia," which is re
produced above, has secured the bronze medal of the Royal Drawing Society this year.
The artist, Miss Nellie Kuck, a young lady of 16, has already won a considerable
measure of success. Two years ago she was awarded Lord Leighton's prize for her

placed parallel with the rifle range. This
condition must prevail in order to pro
duce any appreciable deflection. The
principle involved is that an eiectric
current in a wire produces a mag
netic field, this field theoretically ex
tending to an infinite distance from
the wire. It is most intense in
the region immediately surrounding the
wire and becomes weaker as the distance
increases, the law of variation being in
versely as the square of the distance. Any
magnetic body placed in a magnetic
field (a "magnetic body" is not necessarily
one which is magnetized, but one capable
of being magnetized. Iron possesses this
property in a far greater degree than any
other substance) is acted upon by the
magnetic lines of force and, in case the
field is one of variable intensity, tends to
pass into that portion of the field which is
most intense. Where a circuit carrying
an electric current is parallel with the line
of fire the shot, in its flight, is con
tinually acted upon by the lines
of force of the magnetic field
through which it is passing, and is sub
jected to a continuous pull toward the
wire or that portion of t c field which is
most intense. If the time during which
the shot is acted upon by the force is of
considerable duration the effect may be a
considerable deviation, as is reported to
have been the case in the Swiss experi
ments. It must not be forgotten, how
ever, that time is an important element,
and if a powerful magnet were placed
somewhere alons the line of its flight its
effect on the shot would be but momen
tary, and it could do no more than to
twitch the shot as it passed. This might
be sufficient to somewhat upset the calcu
lations of a marksman who was endeavor
ing to make a 'dead center,' but would
hardly be sufficient to cause the shot to
fly wide of an army or fortification.
"With regard to the writer who pro
poses to protect a company of infantry by
placing a dynamo or storage battery of
requisite power on the flank, it is probable
that he has in mind some new form of

dynamo or battery which will automati
cally follow the company about the field
of battle, remaining continually in the
proper position on the Sank. As at pres
ent constructed dynamos and storage bat
teries would be difficult to handle in this
manner. Moreover, the dynamos or stor
age batteries would in themselves have no
effect under any circumstances, but in
order to produce any effect it would be
necessary to have wires carrying heavy
currents passing from the flanks many
hundreds of feet toward the enemy, and
the writer does not explain how he in
tends to mate these move about the Held,
following the company on these various
maneuvers, always remaining in proper
position on the flank and always reaching
out the requisite distance toward the
enemy. It is conceivable that with an
army in a fixed position on the defensive
a vast array of wires might be run out in
all directions in such a manner that any
particular company would nave wires on
its flanks into which current could be
turned, but the shots so deviated would
be likely to invade the ranks of some
other company, with a consequent pro
duction of domestic discord."
With regard to the reference to Conan
Doyle's "Stark Munro Letters" Stuart-
Smith calls attention to the error in the
statement that the hero proposes to pro

stem and stern. The proposal was to place
powerful electro-magnets overhanging
stem and stern, the idea being to so at
tract the shots as to make them clear the
vessel. "Unfortunately," said he, "if the
magnets were sufficiently powerful to pro
duce such a deflection they would attract
the shot directly to themselves and quickly
promote their own destruction, leaving the
vessel without the protection of the 'im
palpable magnetic veil.' "
Practicable Bicycle Skirt.
Ladies who object to bloomers and
sensibly desire to ride a man's bicycle can
now do so. Mrs. Elizabeth F. McCartney
of New York has patented a skirt that has
all the qualities of a pair of first-class
bloomers and the modesty of a skirt.
The front portion of the skirt is open
part of the distance from the bottom and
the inner edge secured to the back of the
skirt, which falls in the usual manner.
When riding the opening in the front of
the skirt allows it to fall gracefully on both
sides of the frame.

Across the front of the skirt there is a

Motor Attachment for Vehicles.
Every man who owns a buggy can now
have a horseless carriage with little ex
penditure. Heretofore one who would
own a horseless vehicle had to buy the
whole contrivance or build it himself.
But Alfred H. Kennedy of Rockport, Ind.,
has overcome this by inventing a machine
that can be attached to any wheeled ve
hicle.
Briefly, Mr. Kennedy's invention con
sists of a two-wheeied truck with a motor
mechanism and flexible attachments for
fastening it to the vehicle to be propelled.
The attachment looks like an old-fash
ioned cannon.
The details of the construction of this
device are two wheels mounted on a shaft
with a crank connection. Close to the
hubs is a framework that extends forwnrd
and carries the cylinder and other ma
chinery of a gasoline engine. Connection
between the piston and the crank shaft is
made by a connection-rod in the ordinary
way. The gasoline tank is to be carried in
the bed of the buggy.
A GREAT MAP OF
THE HEAVENLY ORBS,
It Will Delineate Thirty
Millions of Spark
ling Stars.
Big Enough to Cover Two Acres
and Cost Two Million
Dollars.
Eighteen Observatories in All Parts
of the World Engaged in
the Mighty Task.
The great map of the sky upon which
astronomers have been wording for the
last nine years is approaching completion.
It is an international affair, for no one
country could carry through such a gigan
tic task.
The heavens have been mapped out. in
sections, a section being assigned to each
of the principal observatories in the world,
and each of these eighteen observatories
must furnish a map of Us particular sec
| tion in 1500 parts. To do this 3000 photo
graphs have been taken at each observa
ory. making a grand total of 54,000 photo
graphs. The United States is not repre
sented in the international congress for
the construction of this map. Professor
Pickering of Harvard wished to undertake
a share of the work, but it was finally
decided that the great amount of time
required for the allotted section would
interfere with the general work of the
Cambridge observatories. The Yerkes
observatory was not, of course, ready at
the time, and the others did not care to
lay out the money for the necessary in
struments. The observatories sharing in
the work are those of Greenwich, Rome,
Catania, rielsingfors, Potsdam, Oxford,
Paris, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Algeno, San
Fernando, Tacubaya, Santiago (Chile), La
Plata, Rio de Janeiro, Cape of Good Hope,
Sydney and Melbourne.
The map will be in total area nearly two
acres, but must necessarily be divided up
into a manageable size. For each hemi
sphere there will be 11,000 little maps, or
22,000 for the whole sidereal universe.
Upon it will be shown about 30,000,000 of
stars. Of these 2,000,000 will be catalogued
and numbered, so that any star up to the
eleventh magnitude can be located as easily
as an island in the map of the world. The
stars actually shown upon the map will
be all those up to the fourteenth magni
tude. A great number of the stars
j shown upon the map cannot be seen
by the human eye, even with the
aid of the most powerful telescope.
The photographic plate, however, can de
tect many millions of stars which no man
has ever seen.
The long exposure necessary in order to
eet photographs of stars beyond the four
teenth magnitude renders the operation
too difficult for the construction of a map.
The measurements and exact position of
each star have to be recorded, and to do
i this hundreds of astronomers have been
working for years.
Special apparatus was purchased by
each observatory for the work. All the
instruments must be similar in size and
construction, or the photograph? would
not be alike. The international congress,
" which was held at the Paris observatory
eight years ago, decided that a telescope
must be constructed for each observatory

engaged in the work. These telescopes
are all of 11 feet 3 inches focal length, with
an object glass 13 inches in diameter.
To take a stellar photograph is not &
very difficult task, says the Pittsburg Dis
patch. The fitters do not nave to look
pleasant, and the automatic movements of
the telescope keep the objective always
opposite the stars to be photographed.
The delicate part of the task consists in
the accurate measuring and placing of the
stars shown upon the photographic plate.
Each negative will be transferred in dupli
cate on copper, and the two plates will be
kept in different observatories. This is to
obviate any chance of accident to the
plates, for if both were lost the damage
would be almost irreparable. Some idea
of the magnitude of the task undertaken
may be gained from the fact that to repro
duce the map from the plates will cost over
$2,000,000. When to this ia added the cost
of the instruments, the time of the cal
culators and measurers and the number
less et ceteras which pertain to a work of
so gigantic a nature, the ultimate cost
will be tremendous. But the man, when

completed, will be of inestimable value to I
astronomers. The idea is to show just
what aspect the heavens presented at the
period represented. Any changes subse
quent to this period will be at once de
tected and valuable information gained.
The observatories participating in this
work will each bear the cost of, and De
responsible for, its own particular piece of
sky. When completed the photographs
will all be forwarded to the Paris observa
tory for the production of the map.
Stellar photographs are always used just
as they come from the camera, without
any retouching whatever. The number of
stars shown is proportionate to the length
of exposure of the sensitive plate. At
first it was intended to include stars of
the fifteenth magnitude in the measure
ments, but the tremendous additional
labor involved caused the congress to fix
tne limit at the fourteenth magnitude.
Almost nothing is known of stars which
are such an enormous distance away, and
no map or record has ever before been
made of them. As matters stand at pres
ent a few millions of them might disap
pear without astronomers being any of the
wiser. This gigantic map was planned by
the Paris observatory in ISfiH, and a propo
sition made to all the big observatories to
j assist in the work. Since that date the
i principal observatories have been busy on
I the big scheme, which will certainly be
| the most wonderful thing that modern as-
I tronomy has accomplished.
New Traction System for Single-Track Railway.
New Railway System
Inventors have for many years been
working on what is known as a "single
track" railway; that is, a system that
would have one traction rail and one over
head rail, the car to run beneath tlie two.
As long as the car was running on a
straight track, all previous inventions
seemed to do very well, b':t when curves
were reached trouble began on account of
the action of centrifugal force. As a con
quence, they have been failures.
W. H. Uoynton of Morris Park, N. V., is
the inventor of a railway system that
seems to overcome this great objection.
The principle of the invention consists in
making the two rails conform to the action
of centrifugal force; that is, to build them
at such an angle that they will axially con
form to the curve of the roadbed.
This is, of course, an easy matter to
calculate, so that the cars will swing to
the center as a bicyclist does when turn
ing a corner. By this arrangement there
will be very little strain on the upper rail
at any time, except the car should come to
a standstill, and none at all except gravity
on the lower rail.
Another point of Mr. Boynton's inven
i tion lies in the fact that the rails can be
built parallel to one another and the same
center supports answer. Trains can even
| run in opposite directions at the same
time and there would be little extra strain
as the axial center of the two trains would
be the same.
New Motor Cycle.
The horseless carriage is designed to become
a practical, every-day thing, now that inven
tive genius has solved the problem of applying
power. Charles H. Barrows, a Connecticut
man, stands ready to equip any sort ot
j vehicle with a motor, using either electricity,
! gasoline or compressed air as the power. His
I latest invention is a motor cycle built f.>r two,
] in which the power is applied to the front
wheels instead of the rear wheels, as has been
I the custom heretofore.
The invention is a very simple one, with no
j loss of energy between the motive power ana
the driving-wheels. Mr. Barrows says that
with his method there is no loss of power
through friction of intermediate machinery,
and no excess of power is required to overcome
the short-leverage strain common in the driv
j ing mechanism of other horseless vehicles.
Tbo^e Earthquake Waves-
Science sometimes illustrates a homely
old sayiner about going away from home to
pet the news. For instance, the tide roll
from the tide gauge at Sausalito has been
read by the Coast and Geodetic Survey
and the record marks with accuracy the
duration of the earthquake waves on the
Japanese coast on June 15. Such a record
it would be impossible to make at the
scene of the disaster, for the tide gauge
could not stand under a pressure of waves
thirty feet high sweeping over it. Obser
vations made by local spectators cannot
take the place of the gauge with which
the sea makes its own indisputable record.
The first earthquake wave from Japan, on
! June 15, arrived at Sausalito just about
twelve hours after it received its impulse
in Japan. The first wave was the largest.
This was one foot high at Sausalito. but it
will be recollected that on the Hawaiian
Islands the wave was thirty feet high.
Undoubtedly number one was higher
than one foot when it reached the Golden
Gate, but as it ran through the gate it
was much diminished in size, and as it
ran around a corner to get to Sausalito
c here was a furt her shrinkage. The crests
of the waves as they arrived at Sausalito
were about fifteen to twenty minutes apart,
and they continued to come for about
twenty-four hours. The time taken to
ransmit the oscillation verities the speed
observed in the waves that ran here from
Simoda in 1854, and is a very interesting
demonstration.
LOWEST HUMAN FORM .
FOUND IN JAVA.
Scientists Think It Will
Turn Out to Be the
Missing Link.
Coffin Torpedoes That Are Cal
culated to Blow Up Grave
Robbers.
Peculiar Devices for Securing the
Escape of Those Buried Alive
Recently Patented.
The "missing link" that scientists have
been searching after ever since Mr. Dar
win announced his theory of the descent
of man from the lower animals may have
been found at last.
There have recently been uncovered in
Java by a French scientist, M. Dubois, a
tbign bone, part of a skull and two molar
teeth that seem without doubt to be the
fragments of one of these extinct man
apes.
The teeth are as much larger then the
teeth of the African as the negro's teeta
are larger than the European's. Tha
thigh bone is the size of that bone in the
average man of to-day. The skull ia
about the average in point of brain ca
pacity between the average European and
the highest ape.
The femur or thigh bone is naid to be
unquestionably human. Authorities differ
as to the character of the skuil and teeth.
Shall they be called Human or apish? The
answer can only be definitely given when
all the steps in the change from man to
ape are in evidence and the dividing line
conventionally established.
Professor S. E. Tilhnan, writing in the
Cosmopolitan, says about the Java discov
eries:
"The consensus of scientific opinion,
however, decides that all the remains
must be regarded as numan. It cannot
be definitely determined from this fintl
alone, but it is probable that this so
called Pithecanthropus (erect ape) is the
lowest human form yet found, and is one
of the 'missing links' connecting: man
with earlier and less human forms, and
that he stands a long way off from man
on the line leading to these forms.
"This statement should not be under
stood as impl3*ing any direct connection
between existing men and existing apes,
for it is pretty certain that while both of
thrse may be traced to a common ancestor,
thej have not traveled the same path
from that ancestor to the present, and no
discovery will ever bridge the chasm be
tween them."
To Bow Up Grave Robbers.
The "coffin torpedo" is the latest pat
ented device in the line of burial appli
ances. It is introduced into the casket
before the latter is closed, tne arrange
ment being such that any attempt to force
the receptacle open will release a spring,
strike a percussion cap and set off the
bomb. This means air Lost sure death to
the unsuspecting grave robber, whose in
dustry the invention in. question is de
signed to discourage.
Live people do a great deal of thinking
about death, if one is to judge from the
immense numbers of patents that have
been granted for inventions having rela
tion to the tomb, says the Philadelphia
Times. They run up into the thousands,
and not a few of them are weird and grisly
enough to make the flesh creep. Among
the most interesting are the so-called
"life signals." These are contrivances in
tended to secure the release of persons
prematurely interred. There can be no
doubt that to many human beings the
fear of being buried alive some day is a
haunting dread through life.
All of the patented devices for life sig
nals have one feature in common â namely,
a wire or cord attached to the hand of the
supposed corpse. In each case it is in
tended that any movement shall set off
an alarm of some kind. One contrivance
employs a small red flag, which shoots up
from the grave and displays itself above
ground if required. Another is called a
"grave annunciator." A disturbance in
the coffin closes an electric circuit and
springs an alarm in the watchhouse of
the cemetery. The superintendent takes
note of the number of grave indicated by
the alarm, and proceeds without delay to
die up the victim.
Yet another species of apparatus is oper
ated by a spring catch, which throws open
the lid of a tube extending from the coffin
to above the ground, tbus admitting air.
At the same time a bell is set ringing.
On a somewnat different principle is an
indicator in a glass case, to be placed on
top of the grave and communicating by
wires with the alleged defunct below. I!
the latter moves at all, a needle shows it.
Most elaborate of all such devices is one
in which a wire is attached to a ring on
the thumb of the corpse. The slightest
movement of the hand pulls a trigger
which starts a clockwork mechanism.
This sets off an alarm, and at the same
time puts in operation a fan which
forces down a tube into the coffin. There
is a second tube provided with a lamp and
reflector, so arranged that one may look
down and see the face of the deceased.
After a reasonable period has elapsed, tne
tubes are to be withdrawn.
A statistic fiend has figured out that a
man who shaves regularly until he is 80
cuts off about thirtv-tive feet of hair from
his face.

From all quarters
we hear of weddings
and enga ements,
trousseaux and wed
ding gifts. Among
the most interesting
weddings in Wash

month, were those of
Miss Stevenson and
Miss Fenwick. You

haps you did not know that, for the first
time in the history of the United States,
the Senate sent a beautiful love token,
which will always, it is needless to say, be
a valued heirloom. Very handsome was
the great roll of white satin brocade be
stowed upon her by the Chinese Minister.
As some one wrote, each beautiful remem
brance seemed to have some specially fas
cinating significance.
Pretty Miss Fenwick, an exquisite
blonde, who has not only cameo-like
features and golden hair, but a most fasci
nating smile as well, was married the
same day at noon. The quaint old church
where her mother had been married was
converted into a fairy-like spot by the
masses of palm fronds that arched their
beauty against the glowing background.
Against this palm grove the bridal pro
cession was massed, a train of about a
dozen maids and ushers, the maids all in
pink, with picture hats. Wnile waiting
for the coming of the bride the organist
played "Annie Laurie," the same air that
was rendered when the bride's mother
was married. After the maids and ushers
had taken their place every one looked for
the bride to follow, but instead, next en
tered all her classmates from Columbian
University, maids and men, in their Ox
ford caps and gowns. Most effective was
this innovation, recalling to many lines
from the "Princess."
No one can ever accuse the American
matron or maid of not possessing many
original ideas, and from Baltimore I hear
that at the Robinson-Morton wedding by
way of novelty the bride'B cake w.is pink,
put up in pink boxes tied with ribbons to I
niatch. The bonbons, ices, and every- ;
thing you can imagine at a perfectly
served and elaborate breakfast, were of a |
rosy hue.
The coming marriage of the Princess
Maud will be interesting, as she is a
young woman of strong individuality, <
bright, gay and so full of mischief that, |
w ith all who know her, she is a great j
favorite, and even were not this the case >
the gowns designed in Paris for a Princess j
must excite a pleasurable amount of j
curiosity in most feminine minds. For I
e *atnpie, one white gauze frock destined
'or a ball ia of white gauze embroidered
Wlth appliques of Louis 2LV lace mixed
i with diamond and sky-blue stones; this is
made over white satin. It is half long, a
row of embroidery encircles the foot. The
; low bodice is made with a rounded point,
i the embroidered gauze being introduced
|as trimming. The sleeves are short and
j puffed.
Another evening dress is of white satin
l embroidered all round with imitation
j diamonds, which are also introduced at
I the sides in quillea. The low bodice has
j two crossed scarfs worked with beads and
i diamonds. On the left shoulder is a bunch
jof white and mauve acacia. A calling
costume of sapphire blue velvet has been
greatly admired, moonlight Dlue spangles
j and steel adorn it; the pointed bodice has
j iong Henry II sleeves with very moderate
puffs. The large collar is ala Medici 3 and
j in front of tiie bodice is a bouffant of sky
| blue satin veiled with white tulle.
A dress for the races is composed of black
i and white striped Pekin, with small roses
â  scattered over the white. The bodice is of
j the same with small close sleeve 3, the
smallest possible puff is at the top. A
laree falling collar extends to the waist of
guipure, and in front is a soft vest of white
mousseline de soie. Yet one more evening
1 pown must I describe. It has a cuirass
I bodice of pink satin veiled with white
j tulle, richly embroidered with white silk
! braid spangled with silver, gold, diamonds
: and mauve.
Tins embroidery extends in points much
: lower than the hips on the pink satin
I skirt. The neck and front of the bodice
is completed with straps and bows of
black velvet and white tulip.
From the same celebrated house comes
an elaborate evening cloak of satin ble
( t hat is thesliadeof ripe corn). Silver and
diamonds are combined in the rich em
broidery which adorns the front and back.
The Louis XV style is carried out. Long
and wide are the sleeves and the cape is
cut in scallops embroidered like the rest
and edged with a flounce of white gauze
having a satin border.
A pink taffeta sacque has square
tabbed basques bordered with black vel
vet, and also embroidered in the Louis
XV Btyle with iris beads and gold, in
front is a mass of plisse tulle and velvet

sleeves have toward
the back at the top a
puff, otherwise they
fit closely, with a
Louis XV cuff at the
wrist.
Thus far no article
of this Princess'
trousseau has given
her so much pleasure
as a coat of rich
white satin. In style
it is Louis Quatorze.
The revers, gauntlet
cuffs and deep collar
are 01 an exquisite
' sliver brocade. The sleeves have puffs
which reach to the elbows. Beyond the
cuffs extend frills of chiffon, daintily
worked with silver. The chiffon appears
as frills on the full vest of white satin.
Now, the reason the Princess is delighted
with this coat is because it is a work of
love of six young girls who are learning
the art of dressmaking. Their instructors
furnished the materials which they have
so skillfully put together, willingly hav
ing given up their spare moments and
holidays to complete it. This bit of senti
ment naturally appealed to the maiden so
soon to become a wife.
A fetching scrap of a woman who had
lately become a matron certainly has ex
quisite taste and extravagant ideas, which
a skillful woman abiy carries out. For
instance, imagine a canvas dress of very
coarse texture, of a ficelle tint, mounted
on white taffeta, the full bodice over
hanging a very narrow belt of white kid,
braided with white silk braid, showing a
vest embroidered hi white silk cut down
to the waist, thus revealing a dainty
waistcoat of creamy mousseline de soie.
With this charming conception is to be
worn a black chip hat, !ined with white,
of the fashionable Lamballe shape. Scarfs
of black and white mousseline de soie
i-'dged with lace, a cluster of black and
white ostrich feathers and a cachepeigne
of wisteria gracefully trimmed.
Such an artistic frock, not many moons
ago, was worn by a sylph-like blonde at a
garden party. It was of the palest green
crepe de chine, with braces and a corslet
of the very finest lace studded with silver
sequins. Round the waist was twisted a
velvet ribbon just two shades darker than
the gown. This appeared a?ain at the
! throat, but was covered with the sequined
! lace. A hat of cream Tuscan, having a
, white chiD lining, tea roses, tulle and a
touch of green velvet, went perfectly with
the costume. At the same affair was
j noted a black silk spotted grenadine over
j white silk, made with a tucKed white
j chiffon vest which hung from a small yoke
\ which was made of the finest imitation
, opals I have ever seen.

without much fullness, being of a soft
thick washing silk, matches the serge.
The plain under-sleeve are of the same
white silk. What gives this pown so unus
ual an amount of novelty and style is the
way the back and front of the bodice are
connected. The immediate center of the
back of bodice is composed of one deep
Vandyke of the white serge; the point,
however, terminates in a small full
basque; then a wide sash of navy surah
starts where the basque is held down by
two gilt anchor buttons. Half of this
sash is continued across the front in the
matter of a deep waistbelt, while the
other half is separated into three folded
bands, which are in their turn fastened to
the fronts of bodice by the same kind of
gold naval buttons as are employed at the
back of basque. All the outlining of this
smartfrock has been carried out in a fine
navy cord, and it would be difficult to find a
more perfect gown, either for shore-going
or the more serious business of deck wear.
The model illustrated may be worn by
any one with a good figure. lam quite in
love with it. We are told the skirt is "of
navy solent serge. The upper part of the
bodice is a unique adaptation of a bolero
jacket, and is made of white serge of the
same manufacture as the skirt. A band
of navy-blue is applique to the edge of the
shoulder-epaulettes, to the tabs of the col
lar and those coming from the neck, both
front and back, and the same serge appears
between the curled design, which edges
the bolero. This design is formed of a
lovely tinsel braid, a mixture of many
shades of gold, so deftly woven in with
strands of silk as to give the braid a soft,
old-metal appearance. This braid edges
the bands of navy on the other parts of
the upper bodice and navy satin lines in
the epaulettes. What gives such a dis
tinction, however, to this elegant costume
is the soft, dull silk of which the loose
under bodice and sleeves are composed.
The design ia a fine equal stripe of white
and Sefres-blue, which tones exquisitely
with the other material employed. The
hat of Panama straw is trimmed with
bows, and a painted flag appears on one of
the upstanding ends, denoting that its
wearer possesses the open sesame to the
inclosure of the R. Y. S. White doe
gloves and white silk parasol, with a stripe
of blue satin round the edge of the cover. "
From an equally celebrated tailor is a
chic bicycle suit of nnÂ«! white serge, with
which are to be worn white hat, veil,
gloves and the daintiest of little black
laced kid boots. The skirt reaches the
ankles, and under it are worn riding
breeches of a heavy wMite cloth.
"The reason why I cannot tell, but this
I know I know full well" (I cannot con
tinue to quote the old rhyme, for It would
not be applicable) every fashionable
woman in Paris has purchased, or or
dered, within the last few days a cache
poussiere, and the latest is called the
"Manon," as it resembles the cloak worn
by Manon-Lescant when she descended
from the coach, but the "Manon" cloak
now bo popular is cut to fit the figure, in
stead of hanging from the neck in numer
ous plaits. At the Grand Prix was worn a
cloak pronounced stunning. It was com
posed of a light weight covert coating,
very simple, with an exceedingly wide
cape and an equally large collar. It was
lined with a rich taffeta and was only
trimmed with scallops of the cloth, ap
parently buttoned down each side.
Not only are band-painted grenadines
to be had, but muslins covered with
tiny bouquets are purchased by the ex
travagant. One white muslin was covered
with bouquets interspersed with lines of
light blue. The bo iices to such dresses
are usually a mass of the finest embroidery
with frilled basques, but lace jackets are
also liked in the bolero shape, and the
prettiest of corselets are made of glace silk,
which is usually of red and white, pink
and white or blue and white.
Most of the styles about which we
read are designed for those blessed if not
with perfect at least with fairly good fig
ures; the plump maid and matron are
usually quite forgotten, when in reality
thÂ«y should be shown the greatest consid
eration, and more models should be cre
ated especially with a view to making un
becoming curves vanish. So with pleasure
I make tne following quotation, which
may prove useful:
"One word about tha special style of
bodice which never fails to be the most
becoming and helpful for figures which
nature has made too abundant for grace
or beauty. This is the basque bodice, with
the basque cut deeper than usual. The I
outer material of fronts must be draped
tightly and separately from neck-band to
bottom of the waist or points. It matters
not whether the material is wool, silk
or batiste. The front may be open to bust
line, drooping into a point. A chemisette
of lace or lawn, according to gown ma
terial, with ribbon or lace choker. Deep
square collar revers turn back from this
opening. If of silk they are to be cov
ered with fine lace, but if of lawn needle
work is most effective. A plisse lace
drapery should fall from the bottom of
chemisette to the basque ends or points in
a perfectly straight line with square finish.
When the gown ia of lawn, the same ma
terial tucked or phssed, or an all-over fall
of needlework to match collar revers, will
answer capitally.
"By this style of front the very pro
nounced lines of the figure appear to
vanish, and the size of the waist is not
made so evident, hence the figure for that
reason is greatly improved and is far more
pleasing to the eye."
For a young woman with a beautiful
figure nothing is more stylish than the
Louis XIII bodice; whether built in silk,
tissue, velvet, batiste, it cairies its effect
wonderfully. Imagine a gauffered straw
colored tissue, with a cordod. velvet
Bayadere stripe to match as the chosen
material with which to drape croasways I
the decollete carre silk under-bodice, of
the same shade, to be fastened at the side.
The tissue sleeves fall over the hand in
crenated edges, while the upper parts are
very bouffant and well pushed up. A
picturesque lace collar gives the needed
cachet. An oval of net has a rather wide
flounce of Point de Flandre gathered on
quite full, and is caught in the back by
two diamond buckles. The collar lies
acroÃS tiie shoulders, the drapery arranged
over the sleeves. A jeweled collar or
diamond buckle and velvet is a necessary
neck ornament to wear with this style of
corsage.
One of the hats here given is of a gray
straw draped with gray tulle, over which
ostrich plumes nod gracefully.
I like the simple leghorn chapeau.
Around the brim is a tulle ruche, and a
wide velvet band encircles the crown. A
pair of good white ostrich tips beautify
one side, and a bunch of pink roses nestle
at the base of the feathers.
The hat with the queer "jam-pot crown"
has a brim formed of drawn black net, the
crown being of white lace. A great bow
of ribbon and a cluster of roses give it the
true Parisian air.

Equally well I should like a fane rice straw
beautified with roses in pale shades
placed closely together on one side be
neath the brim. The crown is formed by
a gracefuPy arranged square of China
silk drawn together with a coral and dia
mond ornament.
For large hats veils of white maline are
the latest; they are covered with large i
black spots far apart.
The most beautiful and costly gems con
tinue to be worn on the evening gowns of
all who can afford them. Most chic are
the black gowDS so incrusted, but very
handsome are the black dresses from a

riched with handsome cut jet with which
is combined much ereen iridescent orna
mentation, combining white silk or satin '
in the revers, which are veiled with jet, !
and liases is usually employed as a vest.
I wonder if any of you have heard of
"Pegamoid?" It is a substanceâ or j
should I not say a preparation â which, be- :
ing applied to wall and ceiling papers,
leathers of various makes and kind, blinds,
bedticks, hangings, and linings for ward- ;
robes and cupboards, and many other sub- !
stances, renders each and all water-proof,
dustproof, greaseproof, inkproof and mi- \
crobe-proof. You may, if you so will, !
upset a pot of ink over your new red mo- !
rocco-covered chairs, or down the dado of |
your dainty drawing-room and, provided, j
of course, that they are "Pegamoid," all j
you have to do is to wash the offending
stain with a damp sponge, when every
vestige of the mark will be quickly and
easily removed, and all will appear new j
and clean without so much as a smudge to j
disfigure your now spotless possession.
Pegamoid is being used extensively in j
Europe, and if if- is indeed so wonderful â¢
we may ejepect it before long to reach us, .
for fancy having spring cleaning robbed of i
all its historic horrors.
Women in Europe who have to stand !
severe social strains are now using a few j

Turn Down
Collars for .Men
For ordinary purposes the all-around j
turn-down collar is the most fashionable, i
Single-breasted waistcoats have either j
very narrow lapels or no lapel at all; the!
double-breasted have lapels. I am re- !
lieved to hear that "Him" reports concern- I
ing waistcoats that "In such shops as one
may find on the Strand (the Sixth avenue
of London, or rather the upper Broadway)
you see these violent things in profusion, I
but it is quite another matter as far as the" j
costume of gentlemen is concerned. The i
smart shops are quiet. I have not seen the
exaggerated waistcoats, nor, again, the !
gaudy colors, which from aJfc accounts i
bad been led to expect. I Oppose they
have emigrated to America."
Well, even if they have, the smart set
will have but little to do with them, as the
best dressed men are nothing if not con
servative, but receive the news with com
placency concerning our tailors, for the
same authority declares: "One can justly
criticize Englishmen's clothes â I still con
tend that thÂ« New York tailor is more
artistic and that his wort has a better
finishâ but you will seldom find an i |
Englishman who is not correctly dressed
for the Junction or hoar of the day."
Even in London, however, men are be
coming careless concerning their attire,
and what do yon suppose is blamed for
this? The bicycle. For men show an in
clination to wear at all times and places
their cycling costumes until they have to
dress for dinner. On racing days many
men are seen in dark gray twill frock suits.
for wear in the country a brown tweed
suit, with a brown Hamburg and a Hol
land waistcoat, is useful. Tan suede
gloves and a pint shirt should complete
it, with a becoming tie.
Again and again the question is asked,
"Must I wear a frock coat and a silK hat to
church on Sunday?" I quote an answer
which fully covers tne ground :
It depends upon circumstances and the
local custom. The correct dress for sum
mer at church on Sunday anywhere is
the high hat and the frock coat; but where
few, if any, are wearing frock coats or high
bats, one should conform to what the
majority does. The frock coat and high
hat as a fashion is distinctly derived from
London. It is the almost universal dress
for men at business in London, or in the
afternoon. One will see more high hats
and frock coats in London in one day
than can be seen in New York in a
month. Climate has much to do with all
fashions. The high hat and frock coat
are very uncomfortable articles in hot
weather, and of late years even Londoners
have shown an inclination to abandon
them and adopt the straw hat and lounge
suit in the summer months. In the United
States the customs of dress are also gov
erned by the climate, and whereas one
would never seem extreme in dress in
wearing the frock coat and high hat on
Sunday, at church or at any other semi
formal occasion, he would likewise not
seem careless in his dress or dressed in
appropriately if they wore a dark jacket
ouit and a straw hat. Our recommenda
tion is to observe what others do and to be
guided accordingly.
No one ever thinks of going on a jour*
ney of any length wearing a silk hat, and
this reminds me that in spite of all pre
dictions to the contrary the changes in"top
bats" are scarcely noticeable, bur the
crowns are less bell-shaped than formerly,
and the brims are rather more narrow.
The straw hat is more of a favorite than
ever before in England this season. The
straws are finer and have higher crowns
and less brims. The ribbons are very nar
row. In color they are either black or blue,
except for the young college men.
No well-groomed man now ever appears
East without his opera or crush hat when
in evening dress.
Very useful suits are being made of
tweeds and shepherd plaid and of Scotch
goods.
Many men are ordering suits of blue
flannel.
Men of about 5 feet 10 inches in height
should not wear a sack coat longer than
thirty-two inches. C. C.

THE SAN FRANCISCO STAGE
__ : â  |
If we must have plays "made in Eng
land," they ought to be "arranged and
adapted" for the American market before
being exported, for the way in which audi
ences on this side are expected to laugh at
jokes and grasp allusions that belong ex
clusively to the other side is simply absurd
and ridiculous. Take an instance in
"Sweet Violets." The wicked baronet is
running for Parliament, and he is con
stantly being reminded that if he does not
live free from the breath of slander he will
â¢â¢offend the Nonconformist conscience"
and lose his election. The expression is
meaningless here. In a country with no
State religion people know nothing and
care less about conformity or nonconform
ity, but the English politician will tell you
with bated breath what a tender, sensitive
thing the Nonconformist conscience is.
Offend it and his doom as a statesman is
sealed, though it has frequently been
known to strain at a gnat and swallow a
camel. If American politicians had a
Nonconformist conscience to reckon with,
the political sepulchre might not be any
cleaner within, but its outside would be a
good deal more whited. It is dragging in
Nonconformist consciences and other pe
culiarly Britannic institutions which help
to make English plays dull and incompre
hensible to American audiences.
"I never say a big, big D ,*' says the
Captain of "H. M. S. Pinafore," when he
is enumerating his virtues. - His men-of
war's-men are incredulous, because swear
ing is supposed to be a sailor's preroga
tive, but they agree that he "hardly ever"
says the word that in polite society is rep
resented by the fourth letter of the alpha
bet, followed by a prolonged dash. Poor j
old "Pinafore!" it must be getting sadly out
of date, to judge from the big, bie D 's
that have been rending the atmosphere of
our local theaters lately. "D !" says
Kelcey, in "The Gray Mare." He does not
use the abbreviation either, and there is a
ripple of chastened delight all over the
house, and an incipient tendency to ap
plaud, which a sense of propriety alone
seems to stifle. Finding that a big, big
D-^ â â  gives piquancy to the dialogue, Kel
cey has ventured to use it again, with j
most successful results as far as raisin s a j
laugh goes, and at the 'Columbia it has
been used more than once with marked j
effect, not to point a moral, but to adorn
the play. It requires an advanced intel
lect to see where the wit of swearing comes j
in. Any loafer on the water front can
hurl expletives just as vigorously as Kel
cey, but no one laughs and applauds and
considers that something brilliant has
been said. On the contrary, lady passers
by shrink away and murmur indignant '
things about water-front language and
common, vulgar men. In the interest of \
the Ã¼biquitous young person, it is really
to be hoped that local audiences will try
to put a restraint upon their joy at hear
ing actors break into profanity. One can
not blame the mummers; their business is
to amuse, and if a big, big D is hailed
with delight, they know that they have
found what the people want, and will go
on giving it to them.
"The Two Escutcheons" has been trans
lated into Italian, under the title of "Due
Blasoni." This is how a leading journal,
.the Illustrated Theater, disposes of it:
" 'Due Blasoni,' comedy in four acts, by
Blumenthal and Kadelberg, applauded,
and has been repeated. The first act is in
fantile, one scene in the second is good,
the third act is pretty, and the fourth is
heavy." By the way, credit is here given
where credit is due, and the translator does
not appear as the author of the piece.
California Theater.
"A Bunch of Violets" will be played for
the last time at the California Theater to
night. To-morrow evening the Stockwell
Company will appear in one of the Ly- j
ceum Theater Company's productions,
"Americans Abroad."
As most people know, this play is by the
popular French dramatist, Victorien
Sardou. It contains several prominent
parts, which will give the members of the
company further chances of showing their
ability. Miss Erne Shannon will play the !
role of the young American girl living in !
Paris, who suddenly becomes rich, and I
who, in order to get rid of fortune-hunters, j
pretends that she has lost all her money, '
and thereby induces the man who really j
loves her to speak. The rest of the cast !
will include Herbert Keloey, Olive Oliver, j
Winona Shannon, John T. Sullivan. Wil
liam Beach and L. R. Stockwell. *
Frederick Ward and Rose Coghlan have I
arrived hero and are hard at work with L. ]
R. Stockwell's company preparing for the !
initial production of the dramatized ver
sion of "Carmen," in which they are to
appear at the California Theater on Mon
day, July 13. --
Columbia Theater.
â¢â¢London Assurance" will form this j
week's bill at the Columbia Theater. The
comedy is one that every theater-goer is
well acquainted with. Lady Gay Spanker,
a part which -;o many actresses have tried j
and 30 few succeeded in, will be taken by
Miss Maxine Elliott, whose majestic style
of beauty will add an interesting feature
to the dashing role.
The rest of the cast will be as follows: -
Sir Harcourt Courtley Tyrone Power
Charles Counley T. Daniel I rawley
Dazzle Frank Worthing I
Max Harlcaway Mack yn Arbucklo â

Tlvoli Opera- House.
The season of grand opera, under the di
rection of Gustav Hinrichs. will open to
morrow evening at the Tivoli with a
production of Donizetti's "Lucia di Lam
mermoor." In this favorite work. Mme.
Natili will sing the title-role, a part with
which she has identified herself in Europe
and the East. Maurice de Vries, who is
said to have done good work at the Paris
Grand Opera, and at the Metropolitan in
New York, will sing the part "of Henry
Ashton, and the tenor will be Signor
Michaelena. sSignor Abramhoff, who will
be remembered as one of the best
artists :in the Tavary Company last
winter," will take the part of Raymondo.
The small but effective part of Sir Arthur
Bucklow will be sung by Martin Pache,
and the compremarios-will be Mis 3 Irene
Mull and G. Napoleoni.
On Wednesday Gounod's "Romeo and
Juliet" will be â¢- sung. It is a work that
during the last few years has- almost
superseded "Faust" " in .' popularity, and,
although never heard before in this City,
it is safe to predict great popularity for it.
As a lyric drama it accentuates, the love
element in Shakespeare's.- tragedy, and a
considerable portion of the opera is de
voted to duets between the lovers, the
music of which is of remarkable beauty.
A waltz song sung by Juliet in the first
act is generally the first number that
arouses the general public to the melo
dious and brilliant character of the music.
Mi-s Nina-Bertini Humphries will be
the Juliet and Fernando Michaelena the
Romeo. The page, a mezzo-soprano role,
one of the best in the work after those of
the lovers, will be sung by Miss Anna
Russell.
Special scenery, costumes aud accesso
ries have been prepared, and the chorus
and orchestra have been enlarged for the
occasion.
"Romeo and Juliet" will be repeated
on Friday and Sunday evenings. Next
week's repertory will include two of
Verdi's worksâ "Rigoletto" and "ILBallo
in Maschera."
Grand Opera-Home.
The Grand will have an Eastern attrac
tion to-morrow in the shape of Jules
Walters, who is to appear in ''A Money
Order," a play that has made a hit in New
York and Boston.
"A Money Order" is a comedy-drama,
the scene of which is laid in South Ohio.
It is quite no to date, and is said to afford
Jules Walters an excellent opportunity to
display his powers. Seamons Tibbals is
the author of ti.e play.
The new star will be supported by the
full strength of Morocco's company, Miss
Gaasnian and little Daisy Crogan being re
tained in the cast.
In honor of the anniversary of the hoist
ing of Old Glory at Monterey, fifty years
aeo, the management announce a special
matinee for Tuesday.
At the Orphenm,
The addition to the Orpheum's bill this
week will consist of the Jockley-Roston
troupe, who come here direct from Paris,
having made one appearance only in New-
York on their way here. One of the mem
bers of the troupe is said to enjoy the dis
tinction of beins the cleverest imitator of
a monkey known to the vaudeville stage
he also performs a number of acrobatic
i feat*.
Collins and Collins will appear in new
specialties, and the Rossow Brothers, the
Fredericks troupe, the four Mai>anos and
Lillian Weston have all been retained, and
many of them will appear in new acts.
The vitascope has ended its engage
ment, and the Orpheum management
prides itself on the fact that the invention
was brought to this city before it had been
seen in Chicago and many of the large
cities of the East.
At the Chutes.
Notice will be found in another column
of the opening of the Casino, the big thea
ter at the Chirtes. The performances will
be repeated every afternoon and evening
with the company which made its debut
yesterday. The performers include Sis
seretta Jones, the "Black Patti," the
Marlow-Dunham family, the Russian
Court orchestra, under the direction of
Professor Julik Simonokoff, and Professor
Markart with his troupe of trained mon
keys, baboons and dogs.
The Casino is under the direction of
Gustav and he states that it is
his intention to keep the place supplied
with the best attractions.
Too Much Education.
W. D. Howells, who loses no chance to
publish his belief in State socialism, would
have the theater placed in the hands of
the Board of Education. We think t.oat
this idea alone is enough to show that Mr.
Howells has not divined the relation of
the stage to the people. They want to be
entertained, and they would stay away
with marked unanimity from a play like
this:
Heroâ Maud, dear, remember that 7x8â56,
and that water will not run up hill.
Heroineâ Ah, Harold, how can I forget that
9xÃ -72, or that an adverb modifies a verb
adjective, or another adverb?
(Enter villain, with two assistant cutthroatt.
They seize and bind hero and heroine.)
Villainâ At last you are in me powerâ curses
on you! I have waited for this moment since
the curtain went up. Ha! ha! you must now
listen while I and my trusty confederates re
cite the multiplication table up to twelve
times twelve.
(They do so.)
Of course a good deal of useful knowl
edge could be worked into a drama, but
might it not become tiresome?â Nickel
Magazine.
Howe'< Lant Effects.
Melancholy interest attached to a sale
in Pall Mall recently, says the Pall Mall j
Gazette, when by direction of the executors
the contents of the chambers of the late
Henry Hows, who was for years associated
with Sir Henry Irving'a Lyceum Company,
were dispersed by auction. There were a
number of books, etchings and engravings,
a quantity of decorative furniture and a
perfect little museum of Dresden and other
obina, which found ready purchasers.
Other lots of comparatively little worth
intrinsically were keeuly competed for be
cause of their history. For instance, there
was a gold-hand lignet ring set with corne
lian, presented to Mr. Howe by Macready
on his playing Mark Antony to Macready's
Julius Csesar.
Mapleson Still Active.
It will seem like old times or going back
a decade or more to see Colonel Mapleson
holding forth again with grand opera, but
the colonel, somewhat older in appearance
than of yore, a bit whiter about the head,
a trifle stouter in the girth, but still as
jaunty of step and confident in air as ever,
ib corning over to fight the operatic battle
on his old field, for he will open on Octo
ber 26 at the Academy of Music, New
York. Three months later he expects to
reach San Francisco.
A Manager* Wail.
Well, between the bicycle and the
Presidential campaign, the managers are !
rather dubious about the outlook, says
the New York Herald. Since early spring
pretty nearly everybody has been off pn
the roads wheeling, and the managers say
they couldn't drag them off their bicycles

into the theaters. If it were not a Presi
dential year they might be expected to
come straggling back by September or
October, "but when they're through
bicycling," said one manager yesterday,
"I suppose they'll take to carrying a ban
ner or swinging a torch in the political
processions, and go tramping around
till the election is over. I don't look for
much of a theatrical season till the great
fight is over."
Dramatic Brevities.
Miss Maxine Elliott does not leave the
Frawley Company until the latter part of
July.
The announced engagement of Evelyn
Millard and Anthony Hope is denied by
Miss Miilard's mother.
Rose Coghian will give a production of
MaxO'Kell's new play, "Heartsease," in
New York early next season.
Mr. Sothern opens the Lyceum in Sep
tember in a new play by R. N. Stephens,
called "An Enemy of the Kiue."
Georgia Cayvan has returned from En
rope. She will open her starring season at
Palmer's Theater on October 15.
Victor Herbert's "Wizard of the NiJe"
has been translated into German, and will
be produced at the Carl Theater, Vienna,
early next season.
Alf Hayman will arrive here at the end
of t';e week to look out for the interests of
the Empire Theater Company's engage
ment at the Baldwin.
Mme. de Navarro (Mary Anderson), who
ia stopping at the little village of Broad
way, Gloucestershire, has been coaching a
party of amateurs for a performance given
in the old Tithe Barn, Stanway, for the
Hon. A. J. Balfour.
The English success of Barrett's "The
Sign of the Cross" has turned the minds
of playwrights to religious subjects. A
new author threatens an immediate pro
duction, in London, of a dramatization of
"Pilgrim's Progress."
Miss Elsie Adair, who is resting at her
mother's home in San Mateo, will proba
bly appear for the benefit of the first grand
carnival entertainment to be given at the
Columbia Theater. Miss Adair is prepar
ing for her tour around the world, which
begins next month.
A new style of playing cards is exhibited
in a Broadway window. The pictures are
photographs of prominent theatrical
"stars." They all wanted to be '-kings"
and "queens," so the inventor got up
special euchre decks, that some ot them
would be content to be "jacks."
Since McKinley's nomination the hand
some advance agents who are spending
their summer on the Rialto have taken
on a new dignity and pride. It is said to
be due to the fact that the distinguished
Republican nominee has Deen referred to
as "the advance agent of prosperity."
Mrs. Marguerite Morrow of San Fran
cisco, who went east three years ago to
pursue her musical studies with Madame
MaretzeK, has taken a new departure.
Church and concert work in New York
City has been her occupation lateiy and
for some time past she has been contralto

The Present.
bcexk :
The forecastle of a three-masted ship,
where the sailors are smoking, after cele
brating the glorious Fourth in the water
frontbowl.
Enter Misit Ginger-Snap, a distinguished
lady dramatist, notebook in hand, the ship's
master following her.
The Ship's Masterâ l beg you to desist.
This is no place for a lady. In their hours
of ease the men occasionally use language
which would shoek â
Miss Ginger-Snap (gushingly) â That's
just what I want, captain. Sailors are
such children of nature, and I brought my
notebook to take down the untutored
words as they flow from their lips.
Ship's Master (brutally)â Beautiful, un
tntored humbug! Some of these men
have been drinking, I regret to say, and
you might hear profanity, madame â
oaths!
Miss Ging"er - Snap (clasping her hands
ecstatically) â Do you think I shall? Oh!
how perfectly lovely. You know I am
writing a play with an English duke for a
hero. He belongs to the highest society,
the creme de la creme of the noblesse. I
have not been in the creme de la creme
myself, though of course 1 have to write
as if I lived there, and, in the modern
drama, it is the fashion now to make dukes
and earls and baronets use perfectly awful
language on the least provocation. Now
I have made my duke use d it ten
times already, and the first act is only
half ended. Your men could help me in
troduce variety to give sparkle and tone to
the dialogue.
Ship's Master (mopping his manly brow
with a bandana handkerchief) â Do you
mean to say that you want to hear my
men swear?
Miss Ginger-Skapâ That's just what 1
came for. Will you tell them to go ahead,
please, and not mind me?
Ship's Masterâ Well, I'mâ
Miss Ginger-Snap (impatiently, getting
ready her notebook)â Well, you're what? It
is so provoking to break off in the middle
of a sentence like that. In the modern
drama nothing is left to the imagination,
and when a man is excited he swears just
as he would do in real life. Our leading
man has a fascinating way of swearing
that just brings down the house. The
matinee girls go on purpose to hear the
dramatic way in which he saysâ
First Able-Bodied Seaman (advancing as
spokesman for the crew, who have been listen
ing to the conversation, and whispering among
themselves) â Some of us was at the theater
last night, Miss, and heard him. I says to
Bill Bullock: "Bill," I says, "I don't
shrink from a contest with no man when
it come? to expressm' my feelin's, but
darn me! if I was riz to use that language
when a whole theater-full of ladies was
present." Isn't that what I says, Bill?
Second Able-Bodied Seamanâ lt was.
First Able-Bodied Seamanâ lt seems to
me if the young lady wants to learn the
language of dooks and barronets, let her
go and listen to them ; we don't want to be
mixed up under such people.
Miss Ginger-Snap (imploringly)â Oh,
captain, can't you make themâ talk just
naturally, as they do among themselves?
Chorus of Able-Bodied Seamenâ Not
while you're here, Miss.
Miss Ginger- Snap (tearfully)â And is it
for this that I have braved the water front
alone at night? Is it for this th*t I have
bought a double-sized notebook? My
play will be a failure, and youâ
(bursts into tears and U heard to declare
hysterically that she vill put a phonograph
into the forecastle. The captain leads her
away, while the men sign a round-robin not
to use a word of profanity till the ship is far
out at sea, and the words cannot have a de
moralizing effect on the American stage.)
Curtain.
Derxies
a Makatnrxa
Abbott B. ClarK. formerly of the Theo
sophical headquarters, corner Golden
Gate and Van Ness avenues, this city, has
just returned after a year's absence on lec
ture tours. He says that the interest in
Theosophy is becoming widespread and
that the lecturers find their halls packed
with interested and intelligent people in
every part of the United States. Mr. Clark
has lectured through New England, the
Central States, British Columbia and the
Northwest, and is now on his way to
Southern California, where, he says, there
are more people asking for Theosophy
than anywhere else.
"The reason," he says,"for the special in
quiry there is because much of the Pacific
Coast, and especially Southern California,
was once embraced in an ancient conti
nent on which great civilizations flour
ished and in which much spiritual
knowledge obtained. The impressions of
this are still mained in the astral light
and are now beins reproduced.
"Theosophists are enthusiastic over tne
new cycle on which the Theosophicai So
ciety has entered. Members are joining
faster than their diplomas can be en
grossed and sent out â something over
twenty a day.
"The crusade is meeting with great suc
cess in Europe. It is led by E. X. Har
grove, president of the TheoaopLncai So
ciety in America, Mrs. K. A. Tingley, suc
cessor of Mme. Biavatsky, William Q.
Judge, Mrs. Keightley, better known as
'Jasper Nirniand,' and several other em
inent Theosophists. They are now in
England, and will visit all the countries,
capitals and large cities of Europe, hiring
the larcest halls and holding conventions
and mass meetings everywhere. The at
tention of kings and rulers will be called
to the needs of the masses and especial
work will be done for the poor.
"The object of this crusade is to spread
Theosophy among the people."
"What good will that do, they can't un
derstand it?"
"You are mistaken. Tbeosophy is the
mosi rational and natural system of
thought in the world. It is practical, and
will solve the problems of life. Suffering
comes from the violation of law. Theos
ophy will teach man the lawa of nature
and how to live up to them. The princi
pal teachings of Theosophy are brother
hood, the universal reign and rule of law,
called Karma, and the evolution of the
soul by means of reincarnation. Ti>at is
more easily understood than vicarious
atonement or predestination. It is salva
tion by works, not by faith, and the labor
ing people want opportunity, not charity.
"The crusade will teach brotherhood on
a scientific basis, as a law of nature, the
violation of which, like that of any other
law, brings suffering. They also will carry
a message 01 unity from nation to nation
as a living protest to the present warlike
condition of things. After leaving Europe
they will go to Egypt, India, Australia,
China, Japan, and return to this country
by way of San Francisco.
"About the wedding at the headquarters
in New York? Well, in the first place,
there was no veiled Mahatma there. No
one was veiled. That was alf talk. The
wealing was private and none but mem
bers were admitted. There was nothing
sensational about it. The wedding was
conducted according to ancient Egyptian
sacred rites and was most solemn and im
pressive."
"Is it true that they claimed to have
been married in Egypt 5003 years ago?"
"It was so stated. That they had sacri
ficed themselves for humanity ages ago
and now renewed the bonds under which
they had lived and worked before. The
wedding was a demonstration that the-
osophy is" not opposed to marriage, but
tiiat it leads in this as in all other reforms
by setting up a high ideaf of wedded life.
Social purity shoulc* begin at home. What
begins at home will end in the whole
world."
Mr. Clark lectures at 320 Post street to
night on "The Theosojhical Crusade and
the Mahatmas."
Kditoriiil Gratitude.
There is a Kansas editor who takes the
right view. Recently, under the headline
"We Are Thankful,"" he published the

Qossip
of NeW York
NEW YORK, N. V.. June 29.â Boston
was treated to a good lively mining fracas
last week by Colonel Jim Brazell and
Hugh McDonald, both of California. It
appears that Brazell failed to get his pro
moter's shares from the syndicate of Bos
tonians who made the purchase of the
Pioneer mine for 1250.000 through Brazell
as an agent Things were warming up to
a good lively Western tune when Brazell
and McDonald got hold of a quantity of
the stock and began to cut up some Pacific
Coast capers that staggered the Bostonians
into submission. The papers boiled over
with the discussion, and by the time the
Californian applied for an injunction to

W. R. Townsend of San Francisco, a
brother of the prosperous author and play
wright, Edward W., is spending a few
days at Arvern, Long Island, the guest of
the author of "Cbimmie Fadden." I saw
him one evening talking in the breeze on a

W. E. Dargie Jr., son of the editor of
the Oakland Tribune, arrived in New
York on June 25, having made the- trip
all alone. By the accident of a delayed
train he failed to meet his mother at the
depot; but instead of lostne his nerve
he inquired of a policeman for the ad
dress, and, taking an elevated train,
reached the residence in advance of Mrs.
Dargie. "No particular use of waiting
around," said he, in speaking of the inci
dent. "I wanted to get settled, so I could
take a bath and rest up."
His grit will be appreciated when it is
stated that the youngster is but 13 years
of age. In a month or six weeks he will
accompany his mother on a trip to
Europe.

Every time I pass down Broadway I run
into some of the overflow from the St.
Louis convention. Yesterday the mag
nificent rotundity of the light-hearted
Colonel H. I. Kowalsky filled the main
entrance of the Hoffman House, while the
profusion of diamonds that adorned his
massive expanse of white shirt caught the
eye of the passer-by. In the morning the
colonel saunters down Broadway, takes in
the last styles along the shop-windows
and before sunset glides into Fifth avenue
fully adorned and up to the latest fashion
bulletins. And there are other fads in
dulged in by the redolent Henry. He has
with him his valet, a colored gentleman
who keeps at a respectful distance
and knows the sign language in four
tongues. He can lay out a dress suit, mix
the right thing for "to-morrow morning"
and preserve the crease in a pair of trous
ers better than a Rialto tailor.
I must not forget to cite the fact that
the bicycle mania has full possession of
Mr. Kowalsky. I believe he has his wheel
here with him, and if I am not mistaken I
saw the robust anatomy of our friend
gliding along Riverside drive last night.
He was dashingly attired in a commodi
ous pair of knickerbockers blending
toward his pedal extremities and mixing
fondly with his Russia leather cycling
shoes. I stood transfixed fora moment.
Really one must admit that the poetry of
motion is personified there. It lasted but
a few seconds and then faded away like
the summer wind whirling into space.
Plying re-ularly between the Lamb's Club
and the St. Cloud Hotel, on Forty-second
street, one meets Eugar D. Peixotto, San
Francisco's Assistant District Attorney.
He preserves a well-balanced dignity, in
his Prince Albert, and reads the Sun like
an o!d New Yorker. He nevertheless car
ries with him a delightful air of the West
and watches for the dispatches from the
coast with eternal vigilance.
"Really," said he, when I first met him,
"New York is not unlike any other big
city. One gets up in the morning, reads
the papers, lunches with a friend and
dwindles away the afternoon in any sort
of amusement that seems to be handy.
At night there are the theaters and the
roof-gardens. You can take them in or
idle around some club. Then comes a
night lunch and an hour or two of conver
sation with some congenial soul, and the
day is done. I can do just the same in
San Francisco afte: the day's business is
over, of course, and I see no reason why
New York is any better to follow this
course in than our home city."
Touching on politics and individual*
alike Pacific Coasters will not be disap
pointed to learn that the National organ
izer of the Silver Organization of America,
George P. Keeney, has very favorably im
pressed B. O. Fowler, editor of the Arena.
In a late issue of that magazine he says of
him:
I have been much Impressed by the splendid
work accomplished by George P. Keeney. Na
tional organizer of the American Sliver Or
ganization. Mr. Keeney has accomplished
magnitice.it results; he is one of those rare
men who i.now how to organize and carry
victory with them. On the Pacific Coast and
in the Atlantic division, as well as elsewhere,
his work has been marked by rare sagacity, a
broad, comprehensive grasp of complex situa
tions, and the peculiar power of a genera! who
quickly sees the strong and weak points oi the
opposing forces and also understands how to
meet obstacles, and when to speak and when
to be quiet.
I have seldom, if ever, seen a youne man
who impressed me as possessing in so eminent
a degree the qualities of generalship and those
of a successful organizer as Mr. Keeney. He
seems to me to be a man raised up for au im
portant work at one of the great crises of our
history.
Mr. Keeney here in New York has
formed two silver organizations with
40,000 and 35,000 members respectively,
and at thÂ« meeting addressed by Senator
Tillman at Cooper Union June 2^ thou
sands of people were turned away notwith
standing the statement to the contrary
made by the gold bug press. Mr. Keeney
introduced the Senator from South Caro
lina, and did it like an old warhouse.

to result in disaster, as the hygienists have

As the use of the bicycle becomes more
general touring becomes more a matter of
interest to the average rider, or, more spe
cifically, to those who have taken up the
bicycle as a means of pleasure and ex
ercise, and who are not interested in
racing or in records. This class of
riders already far outnumbers that which
pursues cycling for purposes of personal
gain, or from the desire to excel in speed
upon the track or road; and although the
sporting pages of the daily newspapers
ignore the former class and devote col

is really most largely supported through
the recently developed interest of the noaÂ«
racing cyclist.
In touring the rider should be wary of
coasting, which leads very often to
serious accidents, especially as touring
parties generally traverse roads with
which they are not familiar. As a rule
one should not coast on a very steep
hill, or one with a turn in it, where the
bottom cannot be seen, and, in fact,
coasting should only be indulged in on
a straight, smooth hill, with moderate
incline, and then with the brake part
ly on and the wheel under fuli
control. AU crossroads, should be
very carefully watched, and no one
should coast just behind a vehicle
going in the same direction, as this may
slow suddenly or turn sharply into some
side street. In touring, side-path riding
comes very often into use. Be careful to
watch your path ahead so as to avoid
runaways, thorns and sharp stones,
and also be sure, even in the outskirts of
a town or village, before you take the side
path or sidewalk, that there are no signs
prohibiting its use. It is always wiser
when you get near the center of a town
or village, whether any signs are visible
or not, to ride in the street if it is at all
passable.
J. Cleveland Cady has summed up the
charms of cycle touring very succinctly,
as follows: "Any one who wishes to get
the most out of a vacation, both in
healthful invigoration and pleasure,
will find a wheeling tour su
perior to any other means. Nothing so
completely takes the mind from business;
the wheel demands and will have the at
tention that is not absorbed by the scenery,
or circumstances of the trip; business and
the ordinary cares of life are quite
forgotten. The lungs receive a thorough
revivifying, and the circulation starts into
healthful activity; sleep becomes sound,
appetite voracious and digestion perfect.
Certainly this is an ideal condition for ta
overworked brain-worker or a man en
slaved in the routine of business."âHar
per's Weekly.
By far the greater part of the accidents
that occur in milis, etc., happen during

VII 111 J. & *'. hESSELEB.THE PUCE TO BORE
FOR PAYING OIL,
Immense Quantities of
Petroleum in This
State.
Much Scientific Information Ob
tained for the State by
W. L. Watts.
Examined Gedrgical Formation and
Mapped Oat All Southern Oil
Districts.
Long investigations just completed by
the State Mining Bureau confirm the
article published in Thk Call a few days
ago in which A. S. Cooper, the Santa
Barbara asphaltum and oil expert, de
clared that California has great possibili
ties as an oil producer.
W. L. Watts returned yesterday from
the southern part of the State, where for
almost a year and a half he has been con
stantly at work examining and mapping
the oil districts of Santa Barbara, Ventura
and Los Angeles counties. He has done an
enormous amount of work along lines that
had not before been scientifically followed
in California, and he has collected much
valuable data which he will later embody
in a pamphlet report treating the subject
of the oil fields of the State.
"There is an immense quantity of oil in
California," said Mr. Watts, when seen at
the Grand shortly after his arrival. "All
the way from San Diego to Humboldt
County there is a great oil district follow
ing the slopes of the Coast Range.
"Mr. Crawford, the State Mineralogist,
anticipated the growing importance of pe
troleum as a California product, for it was
at his suggestion that I undertook this
work in Southern California. I was de
tailed to gather all the 'informa
tion obtainable concerning the cur
rents of petroleum in theÂ» southern
districts and to make sketch maps show
ing the geological position of formations
yielding the oil, the object being to ascer
tain on what geological horizons prospect
ing for petroleum would be likely to be
most successful
"Many men have been working on the
same iaea in the Eastern oil States. It it
something that requires much time and
labor. Here the completion of the worfe
will require careful and persistent effort,
as tbe broken nature of the geological for
mation in the Coast Range made it a task
more difficult than that undertaken in the
Eastern oil regions.
"I have examined and n.apped the Sum
merland oil district, a few miles below the
city of Santa Barbara; the oil district
north of Santa Paula in Ventura County;
the Sespe oil fields in the same county;
the Los Angeles oil fields; the Puente oil
fields, also in Los Angeles County; and all
the country intervening. I was greatly
interested in the work and was in the field
seven days in the week for nearly a year
and a half.
"There is still a good deal of work to be
done in working up the paleontological
conditions. My report will show* the geo
logical horizon of oil-bearing formation
vhere they are situated, their extent and
(he structural conditions in whioh oil oc
curs in valuable quantities."
American Prices at Moscow
Headers of the daily papers interested
in the descriptive articles on the Czar's
coronation in the old capital of Muscovy
may have seen among other paragraphs
the important statement, evidently cabled
ofer to America for the special benefit of
aL of as, that "foity-nine eminent singers
have been engaged for the festivities and
that Siegfried Arnoldson.one of them, will
siig ten times and receive ?IGOO for each
performance."
-'o doubt much alarm will be created in
Eirope by the publication ol this item,
particularly after the information gets
Lac* aeain to Russia on the return wave,
where consternation may ensue. It does
not make so much difference to us here,
because we are battling with a great finan
cial problem as it is. But it must not be
forgotten that the appropriation for the
Moscow coronation festivities was long
since fixed, the sum of 13,000,000 rubles
being put aside for the fetes, and now this
Arnoldson engagement of ten perform
ances at $1600 each, which means $16,000,
or 32,000 rubles, will upset things most
damnably at the Kremlin. It may event
ually lead to the nnal dismissal of Pobo
donistieff, for it is be who has overlooked
this great outlay in the original esimates
and it is he who will be blamed by mil
lions of moujiks and billions of the cream
of Tartary, who, in consequence, will now
be deprived of their vodki.
And what a storm of indignation will
arise when old man Fob and General^lgna
lieff and the old duck, Vladimir, and
others learn that this same singer sang
wisely, but not too well, in this country
for Maurice Grau at the Metropolitan
Opera-bouse for about two hundred cold
plunks, or 400 rubles a night, and a mighty
j.riceitwas â considering. Shades of Ru
binstein's Ivan the Terrible! How you
will splutter when you ascertain the price
of Arnoldson in Moscow and the price she
got on Thirty-ninth streetâ and then was
not engaged for the next season either.
It is not reported who the other forty
eight singers are who have been giving
vent to their acquired feelings before the
Czar and his court at Moscow during those
twenty days of anti-nihilistic fun and
jewbilation, but if each one has a press
agent who can get the newspaper manager
at Moscow to do as Fischoff , who is Arnold
son's husband and agent, has succeeded
in doing in this case, the total sum at
tached to their names would 48x1600,
which is 76,800 ten times for the ten per
formances, and for all the forty-nine, in
cluding ArnoldÃon, the sum of $748,000. or
in rubles 1,568,000. No wonder we have
been exporting gold to Russia. It is for
Fischon and his wife and the other forty
eight great singers, and if we had had no
gold, if silver were now current at 16 to 1,
which would of course signify that the
gold had all been drawn out of the coun
try, Russia could not have secured any
without a premium and Fischoff would
have bankrupted that nation, for all it
needed on top of tnese salaries was the
premium.
Who is the genius to be credited with
petting up iliat corner in singers for the
Moscow operatic racket? Was it Fischoff
himself? When he married Arnoidson
no one considered him a genius; but the
marrying of singers oftentimes has a re
markable effect upon otherwise ordinary
men.â Musical Courier.

A FEW OF THE STRANGE THINGS DONE BY THE ST.' LOUIS TORNADO.
[from the St. Louis Republic.]
Whist beginners and the moderate play- I
ers, as some writer designates a large class
of whisters, often complain that they have
no opportunity of practicing and playing
with the players of recognized merit.
Some never mage an audible remon
strance, but unquestionably think they
are not receiving treatment that is quite
fair. Others voice their grievance, and
the protest often reaches the ears of the
managing committee of tne club. In
many places schemes of rotation play have
been tried, by which each player will play
with all otner members, or the partners
have been drawn by lot, or progressive
teams of eight have been started, with the
winners of each match moving np into a
better grade, but all such plans which aim
to compel the good players to practice
with beginners usually result in lailure,
the good players remaining away or re
fusing to enter the contest.
The beginners have a certain amount of
justice in their complaint; perhaps they
could make good scores if given an oppor
tunity to play with the assistance of a
strong partner. The "graduate" must
not, however, be censured too severely. It
is tbe same in all walks of life. At dancinp
school the finished waltzers do not care to
tread a measure with beginners who con
tinually stumble over their toes; business
men do not choose an inexperienced and
incompetent partner in a business venture,
but select brainy and gifted men who can
aid and not retard.
The young wbist-player is like the
young lawyer. He must show bis ability
before he i 3 recognized. He must make
himself feared as an opponent; then he j
will be sought after as a partner. To do j
this requires study, work ana practic â â¢â¢
Whist being purely a mental recreation, !
every one cannot play witn equal ease.
Nevertheless whist-players are made.tnot
born, and all can hope to become good
players. Some will need to do more
work than others to acquire the desired
proficiency, ]ust as some minds take natu
rally to mathematics and Â«ome do not.
With the former the addition of a long
column of figures is accomplished witn
rapidity and ease, while the latter must
take much time and pains to perform the
addition correctly, but they will find the
sum just as surely, and with practice they
will become skillful.
If you wish to acquire a foreign language
it wiil require study and application. You
cannot hope to wake up some morning
and be able to speak and understand
French, having acquired the language in
your dreams.
That skillful writer, T. E. Otis, in speak
ing of becoming proficient at whist, says:
"To become a proficient whist-player
there is no better practice ti an to play
over a hand, then analyze it, noting tbe
fine plays and the errors. Do this after
the play of tbe band, never during the
play. From the moment the first card
touches the table until the last trick is
turned, never discuss the play. If a series
of hands is played and a record kept of
each card as it is played, and these an
alyzed in the most thorough manner, with
ail tbe cards spread on the table, the
bad plays may be noted and particu
larly impressed upon the mind and
their bad effects be so marked that
they will not be easily forgotten. It
is only by continuous, patient study of tbe
many conditions and combinations of
cards that one is able to acquire an easy
manner and get accustomed to playing
correctly without matting a great effort.
Memory is not so much a factor in whist
as is the natural or acquired habit of care
ful observation. If you observe carefully
and thoughtfully you will recollect. As a
test of your usual habits lay down this
paper and see how much you can recollect
of the thoughts and wording of the article
quoted above from Mr. Otis. If you can
not recall much of it read it over again,
considering the ideas and meaning care
fully, and then try again. This is not
memorizing, but simply observing and
noting.
Some one has said that if on coming out
of a room, in which you had been only a
few minutes, you were asked bow many
chairs there were in the room, you prob
ably could not answer. This would not
be a fault of the memory. It would simply
be a lack of observation. If you had ob
served that there were seven chairs the
mind would have no difficulty in remem
bering the fact So with cards played at
tbe whist table. If you will note and ob
serve them the mind will remember them.
Draw inferences when the cards fall so
that when it comes your turn to play you
will know what to do, because the remain
ing cards are placed- A sad habit is to be
inattentive during the lall of the cards
and late in the hand try to go over the
play to locate the unplayed cards.
Do not play a listless game. Give each
hand your undivided attention or better
not play it at all.
When you study over illustrated hands
lay all the cards before you on the table;
imagine yourself each one of the placers
in turn ; before you play a card step and
think what you would do if it was your
turn to play in an actual game and note
wherein your play would be different from
that in the illustration.
Practice and play of this kind will soon
make whist easy and make the beginner a
desirable and sought-after partner.

"Cavendish" and Whitfield will sail for

Miss Wheelock is reported to have said
that the most delightful game she Dad in
Brooklyn was with Whitfield as a partner.

We have received a copy of "Whist
Openings: A Systematic Treatment of
the Short-Suit Game," by E. C. Howell.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1896.
The bark is gone, bat the leaves remain.
One of these stone steps was drive
into the ground unbroken.
WHIST
The press of the country treat the new
book with considerable kindness, actuated,
we believe, by the personal feelings of the
whist-writers for Mr. Howell. It appears
wofully weak and vague in spots.
In the firsthand used to illustrate the
advanta c of the short-suit play a gain of
two tricks is claimed for the short-suit
opening. An examination of the hand,
however, shows that the gain is not made
altogether by the opening, but by the good
play in the trump suit in the middle of
the hand. Does short-suitism need to
be upholstered by erroneous statements?
The American leads and long-suit play
never needed any such supports.
Milton Work speaks as follows of the
book: It outlines a complete system of
leads (mainly of the short-suit variety),
which when used at once removes from
short suitism the objection of being non
informatory. The plan suggested is to
divide all leads into five classes, viz.:
Long-suit game when you lead a 2, 3, 4
or 5.
Ruffing game when you lead a 6, 7 or 8.
Supporting-card eanie when you lead a
9, 10, jack or queen.
High-card game when you lead an ace
or king.
Trump game when you lead a trump.
The followine are some of the writer's
main ideas on the subject:
"PI .y the long suit came if you have a
good plain suit, fair strength in trumps
and at least one reasonably probable card
of re-entry in another suit.
"You should not indicate the long suit
game by your original lead unless you are
perfectly willing that partner should im
mediately lead trumps from strong or
weak ones.
"With an established suit (either in
j your own or your partner's hand) four
trumps and a card of re-entry in another
suit lead trumps."
He Â£ives the meaning of leads in the fol
lowing summary :
Ace followed by king indicates the
| high card game, generally five or more in
I suit with little or no strength outside of
i the suit led, followed by small card indi
| cates the rutting frame with probably no
j more in the suit led.
King followed by ace indicates the
: high-card game, but greater accompany
ing strength than ace followed by king â
| unaccompanied by ace indicates the high
! card game with probably queen and jack
and others of the suit remaining.
Queen indicates the supporting-card
game and not more than two in the suit.
Jack, followed by queen, indicates the
high-card game, re suit led being queen,
jack, ten and others, followed by ace or
king or a small card, indicates the sup
porting-card game, and generally not more
than three in suit.
Ten or nine indicates the supporting
card game; followed by jack or ten, re
spectively, indicates a suit of four or
more; doe* not deny higher caids in suit.
Eight, seven or six indicates the rufflng
>rame, witn generally not more than two
in suit; generallyjdenies any higher card
in the suit.
Five, four, three, two, indicates the
long-suit game, with probably a good suit
and certainly trump strength; commands
partner, if he gets in early, to lead trump.
'1 his is all thoroughly, ably and care
fully explained in a style that is sure to in
terest any whist-player. One objection to
the system (which we believe to be the
greatest trick loser we have ever been
called upon to consider) is that while it
may fit a few hands, in many caees it will
force a disadvantageous lead. As an ex
ample, we give a few of the leads it neces
sitates, all of which Mr. Howell advocates.
Hearts are trump in all three hands,
and in no case is the turn-up an important
factor. The card Mr. Howell would lead
is indicated by an asterisk.

The above seven hands are among forty
given by Mr. Howell on page 87, the
first page of examples of leads given by
him.
We think no further examination or
comment is necessary; any system which
requires such a sacrifice as any one of the
above leads in one hand out of every six
cannot be worthy of adoption.
In spite of our earnest disapproval of
the system, however, we consider
"Whist Openings" interesting reading for
the student and experienced player.
We believe an examination of ' Mr. How
ell's book will go !ar to bring back to
the lone-suit fold those wno may have
moderate short-suit leanings, and will
strengthen the views of the vast majority
who have never swerved from the true
faith.
One year ago Mr. Howell went to Min
neapolis with a "system" which was ex
pected to electrify the whist world, but
which its advocates abandoned as worth
less within a week. We do not look for a
more extensive future for the system he
now supports.
The solution of our problem No. 6 is as
follows:

Trick 3. If East refuses to take king of
diamonds, South discards his heart, and
the remaining three tricks for .North and
South are obvious.
If South trumps ace of diamonds, West
makes Doth clubs and queen of hearts.
If South discards heart, West will win

two tricks with his remaining cards; South
must therefore discard his clubs.
Trick 5. West has the option of dis
carding a club, or a heart, or of trumping.
I have shown tbe play following discard
of a club. If he discards the heart, South
at trick 7 leads ten hearts. If West
trumps, North overtrumps, otherwise
pacseg.
In case West trumps at trick 5, North
overtrumps, and the last three tricks are
made by North and South on a cross ruff.
The ventilation of mo9t whist club
rooms is atrocious. Windows make ba 1
ventilators, as they make draughts on
those sitting near" if they are open. If
they are closed the room soon becomes
close and stuffy. Electric exhaust fans
are suitable for most rooms.
Pembrtdge'a ideal whistroom had
neither doors nor windows, as they may
admit draughts. He said windows es
pecially were objectionable, as some
scoundrel might raise the sash and an
other scoundrel might lower it again.
Again, windows instead of being placed
in the ceilinsr or the floorâ where you
would naturally expect to find them â
were always at tbe side of tbe room, and
no player could see a card with the win
dows) in such a position.
The following interesting hand is by W.

TRICK-
Trick 1 â Y does not commence a cail
for trumps, altboug i be is strong, since
it seems probable that he mav be able to
force his partner by leading losing dia
monds. When a player'? long suit can
not possibly be established a trump lead
is generally inadvisable.
Trick 2â By leading the queen A shows
that he has the knave and one other
diamond exactly. 6 has called for tiumi s.
Z playing ihe ten has no more diamonds.
Trick 5â Y cannot lose anything by de
ceiving his partner as to tne position of
the trumps, and a false card can do no
harm. It is advisable riot to let B know
that Y has tne major tenace, which he
must know if Y wins with the knave.
Trick 7 â It is advisable to lead a second
round of hearts before returning the club,
for fear A may get in and eive his partner
a discard on a winning diamond.
Trick 10 â The position of the remaining
cards is now quite clear to Y. B can have
nothing but trumps, and A has knave of
diamonds. If Y leaves the trick to his
partner ihe latter must lead a suit which
A can trump. E will of course play his
best trump. A will have to play a card
of his major tenace or else leave
the lead with A, and have his tenace led
through; in either case, he only makes
one more trick. But by trumping this
trick and leading a diamond, Y can place
the lead in B's band, who. having nothing
but trumps, must win ihe diamond trick
and then lead up toY's tenace.
At trick 1, it is doubtful whether D
should commence a call for trumps.
Most players would probably do so.
At trick 4, Z does not deem it advisable
to show precise number by leading bis
fourth best, as there has been an adverse
call for tramps.
At trick 10 B's best play is doubtful. If
he leads a trump Y, alter winning with
the knave, should lead ace, and next the
losing trump, to put the lead into B's
hand.

Tobacco in America.
Caricaturists in depicting a German are
in the habit of putting a big pipe in his
mouth. The pipe is national, indeed; but
the Germans as a nation are far from being
the greatest smokers. They do not smoke
more than Frenchmen, Russians, Swedes
or Hungarians. The men of the United
Btates and tue men of Switzerland are the
most inveterate smokers in the world. In
these two countries the consumption of
tobacco per head is three timesgreater
than in Germany.
Standings are provided for only 5000

A COLLISION IS THE FIELD.

another's way. Kelly, who pitched such a
magnificent came against the Pacifies two
weeks ago, seemed to have been training
a la Corbett, on shrimp salad. At any rate,
his opponents found him the easiest of
easy games.
Tbe contest between the new Oakland
representatives and the Pacifies was quite
an improvement over its predecessor, but
by no means *hat it should hare been.
The Oakland organization is a good one,
and it seems probable *nat it will win tbe
City League pennant. However, the men !
from across the bay showed a lamentable
lack of team work. They also need a
pitcher. Noian was heralded as a college !
pbenom, but he is many notches removed
from beinir even a clever amateur.
Had MtCarty, the regular pitcher of the j
Pacifies, been on hand the result of the I
game would have undoubtedly been re- j
versed and a clever young player been
spared a puinful accident.
Ovring to MtvJarty's non-appearance [
Monaban was taken lrom short to fill the
pitcher's box, and Bodie, the promising j
catcher of the Calitornia team and proba- i
bl* the best man in that organization, sub
fitituted for Monahan. In the fourth in
nint;, while trying for a high fly in lelt
field, Bodie. Mu.ler and Cosgrave collided,
with the result liiat both bones of Bodies !
lelt Jeg were broken below the knee. He I
was taken to his home in a patrol wagon. '.
A young man named McKee was put in
the game after the accident. He played
in right field and McDermott took Bodies
place. McKte is a good player. Out of
four times at bat he made two hits, both

of them good, clean ones, and stole two
bases. He also made one put-out on the
only chance he had.
The spectators had little time to grow
cold after the game commenced. In only
j one inning did both sides fail to score.
I The Oakiands were first at bat. Agnew
i singled ana Arlett followed with a two- j
I bagger, but the Churchmen failed to score, i
j The Pacitics started : the' run-eetting in
I their half, tallying one on Monahan's
j double and Wilds' single.
From then on until the ninth it was a
' see-saw. The visitors made two each in
i the second and third and the Pacifies two
in their half of the latter. In the fourth
six of the Oaklands circled the bases and
things looked easy for them. The Pa
cifies, however, went to work with a will
and made four in the fourth, two in the
fifth and three in the seventh.
O'Neill's heavy hitters were not to' be de
nied, and in the ninth man after man hit
safely until six singles had been piled up
and three men scored. Then Agnew was
put out at the plate and O'Neill flew out, j
Walter scoring on the throw- in. Keating
followed with another safe â¢ drive, and
Hardie tallied. Davis retired the side on
a fly to first.
In their half of the ninth the Pacifies
went out in one-two-three order.
The new team is composed of heavy hit
ters and clean base-runners. Donovan,
who plays first, can run a hundred yards
better than eleven seconds. His batting
ability is proved by the fact that out of six i
times at bat ne made three hits. Agnew 1
is a poor fielder, but a hard hitter, his per- i
centage being the same as Donovan's.
Ariel t, the shortstop, is a jewel. He !
made four hits, two of them doubles, out |
of a possible six. He, too, is a runner par \
excellence. Walters hit twice and made '
four runs, i Irrepressible "Tip" O'Neill got i
his base on balls three times and made â 
three runs and a single. Keating's batting
record was the beat of all, he scoring five
safe ones.
Of the Pacifies, Monahan easily carried
I off the honors. He made two singles, two
i doubles and a triple and failed but once to
i hit safely. He also made four runs, stole
I two bases, made three putouts and four
j assists without an error. . Wilds batted
I well. Out of ; a possible six he culled a
I triple, a double and two singles. The bal
| ance of the teams secured but five hits al
together.
Frdm now on it will take a mighty good
i team to get within hailing distance of the
; Oaklands. : Donovan, Arlett, Hardie,
; O'Nril, Keating and the rest of them form
; a strong combination of old-timers and
! young bloods.

LAUGHS AT TORNADOES,
(
And la Fortified When at Home Against
the Worst of Twisters.
Over in Quindaro, Kans., is a man who
laughs at tornadoes â when be is at home.
Pat him among strangers, however, and
the commonest little dust whirlwind,
: bouncing along a road, will cause him to
i quake with apprehension, saya the Kansas
| City Star. A black spot in the sky on a
summer afternoon no bigger than one's
i hand soon takes on, for him, a most
I prodigious size. He reads in the daily
I papers accounts of the storms that swept
| over Kansas and Texas, and for weeks
i afterward he relates in a dramatic manner
the stories to the credulous ease-takers
who assemble daily at the corner grocery.
He begins to talk of the tornadoes as soon
as the ice and snow of winter melt, and it
depresses him to contemplate the dire dis
asters that may come forth from the yawn
ing chasm of destruction between cold
weather of early spring and late fall.
He has accordingly ., fortified his home,
and when there defies the worst twister
j that ever blew water out of a cistern .or
feathers off a chicken.
Underneath his house is a large cellar,
dry as a bone, in which is kept the family
provisions. On one side of this cellar and
into the earth beyond descends a flight of
steps leading, into another cellar. This
latter cellar is cemented from top to bot
tom, and is so carefully constructed that
not a drop of water can enter." A ventilat
ing shaft reaches the open air above,
! making it impossible for a person in the
collar to become sufficated. This subter
ranean abode is the envy and admiration
of the neighbors, but "every ; rose ; has its
j thorn." In the neighborhood lives an old
I farmer who is something of a fatalist. He
passed by one day while the cellar was
being dug.
"Well, now, what ye think ye re doing?"
"Building a cyclone cellar. . .
; 'Ye jest might as well stop wastin' yer
muscle, fer r if ye're born ter git killed by
one of them danged cyclones it'll git ye, if
! ye're fifty feet under ground."
â¢' The owner of the cellar never quite re
' covered his faith after this bit of fatalism.

> Holtke and Bis Generalship.
The question has often been raised,
"What system' did Moltke pursue in
I strategy? All are now pretty well agreed
in answering it as follows: â¢. "His system
I lay â  in the . maxim, 'March ,on different
! lines, ' and : concentrate to strike.' ",? The
question is, >of course, wrongly put, f for
' what great commander ever followed any
j "system of strategy"? And the answer
I given above is not Jess wrong in itself, for
it expresses no principle, but merely con-
I tains one 7of -many conditions 'without
I which great bodies of troops cannot pos
j sibly, be bandied, or war on a large scale

DICKENS AND CHILDREN.
He Broke the Little Girl's Doll, but
Made Ample Amends.
Charles Dickens' love of children is well
illustrated in the following story: He was
! walking in the neighborhood of Gads Hill
one day, not long alter he had acquired
his property there, when he suddenly ran
into a little girl wneeling a doll's peram
bulator. In an instant the tiny vehicle
upset, the doll being thrown out.
It was a bad accident as far as they were
concerned, for wax heads ana limbs are
not calculated to stand much hard usage.
The littie maid burst into tears, and, much
to the novelist's sorrow, refused to be
comforted.
"Then come home with me," Dickens
whispered soothingly, "and we'll see if
we can't find some grand waxen lady in
silks and satins for you."
So back to the big house the two went,
and, sure enough, up in his children's
nursery he managed to discover a few
prettiiy dressed dolls. With theÂ«e safely
tucked in her perambulator the little girl
trotted cff.
But it is in the sequel that the best part
of the story lies. The child's heart was
set on making some return for this kind
ness, so her parents, who had not tbe
j faintest suspicion of her friend's person
ality, took her to town to choose some
thing. Her choice fell eventually upon a
gorgeously bound book.
When Dickens the next day undid the
parcel his small visitor brought him he
was surprised and delighted to see a copy
of "David Copperneld."
Not intil many years later, when they
I met a^ain in society, did the little girl
I learn who the "kind gentleman" wa3.

LEPERS' HAPPY FOURTH.
Commencing the New Treatment
Which It Is Hoped Will
Cure Them.
Old Annie Plays " The Red, White and
Blur' on Her Music-Box in Honor
of the Day.
Yesterday vras a Fourth of glorious
prospects as well as being a glorious Fourth
at tbe Peathouse. It was the first day of
the leprosy treatment from which all the
inmates of the Pesthouse expect so much.
All the lepers began taking the medicine
and although it will be a month or so be
fore much can be determined as to the
efficacy of the treatment, nevertheless all
are nopeful.
The medicine schedule, as published in
yesterday's Call, went into effect ana each
patient took the bath, the tea and three
doses of pills. Superintendent Keating
fears that the Chinese, wno become im
patient unless they see immediate benefits
from a medicine, will not persevere, but
the white lepers will continue the treat
ment. The two Bindt boys took the med
icine five years ago and Superintendent
Keating believes it practically cured them,
for they have not become any worse since
then.
The lepers were anticipating a feast of
roast pig yesterday in honor of the Fourth,
but the porcine delicacies came too late, so
the spread was postponed until to-day. A
keg of beer allayed their disappointment
somewhat, however, and they felt ia quite
a mood to celebrate. Old Annie, the
Chinese woman, had her room fixed up,
and when a Call reporter stopped a mo
ment at her door she insisted on playing
"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean," on
her music- box.
Several of the Chinese upstairs were
I busily perusing the strange Oriental
hieroglyphics in the instruction books
that come with the boies of medicine.
Most of them are quite hopeful at present,
Out it is doubtini whether they will con
tinue the somewhat tiresome bath treat
ment, which, according to a member of
the Board of Health of Honolulu, who
was here visiting a few weeks ago, is the
most beneficial part of the remedy. One
of the Chinese patients, who has had the
disease but a short time, can be entirely
cured, according to tne doctor's opioniori,
ii be keeps up the treatment.
