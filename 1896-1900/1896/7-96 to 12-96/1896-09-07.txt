Body.

SACRAMENTO, Cal.,. Sept. 6.â A1l
night long parties cf keen-eyed, vieilant
men scoured the street and byways of the
little town of "Washington, opposite Sacra
mento, in Yolo County, in the hope that
some trace might be found of the com
panions of the train-robber who met his
death at the I ands of brave Engineer
Ingles. All night long the huge wooden
railroad Dridge which spans the river at
this point was closely watched and the
local police force scoured thedrinuine
dens of the water front and dives of the
city, searching for some clew which might
lead to the capture and conviction of those
who made such a desperate attempt to
gain an entrance to the coffers of Wells,
Fargo & Co., but al: in vain, and as the
gray of early morning appeared across the
eastern sky a body of man-hunters, many
of whom had achieved more than a local
fame, gathered in t.e railroad depot pre
paratory to a start for the scene of last
night's attempted hold-up, from which
point a systematic search was to be insti
tuted.
The party consisted of Shenfi Johnson,
Detectives Al Gibson, William Ahem,
Enoch Dole, Frank Snook, Policeman
Talbot and a Call representative. All
we-e armed with messenger shotguns,
rifles or revolvers.
Shortly after the assembling of the
party an engine and one coach backed
into the depot. The party boarded it, the
engineer pulled the throttle and the little
special soon 1 was speeding along over tne
rails almost as fast as Engineer Ingles'
iron Corse .bad traversed it a few hours be
fore.
Running to within two miles of the spot
where the body of the dead robber had
been found.tne party left the train, which
pulled out for the Swingle switch, a mile
beyond the scene of the attempted hold
up, in order to leave the main line clear
for the passage of trains, and the search
began.
The men separated in pairs and paced
along the tract, slowly and carefully
scrutinizing every inch of the embank
ment on either side to locate tde spot
where the outlaws, who had supposedly
sprung from the rapidly njoving train on
the previous evening, had alighted. Even
the thick mass of willows and under
brush wnich lines the railroad for miles
was carefully searched in the hope that
some broken branch or twie might mark
the resting-place of a wounded man, for
it was a matter of certainty to the railroad
officials that no living being could have
jumped from a train going tifty miles at
hour without sustaining some injury, per
haps mortal, perhaps only to cripple and
make more desperate the man who sus
tained it.
The first piece of evidence obtained was
one of the masks of the robbers, which
had caught on and lay partially concealed
beneath a bunch of weeds beside the iron
track. This was found by The Call rep
resentative, who was walking in the lead

of the party, in company with Detective
Gibson.
The mask was formci of a new red ban
dana handkerchief, with white stars on it
as large as a silver quarter. Two of the
ends were knotted together, so as to pass
around the top of the head, and holes were
cut in the fabric for the eyes, nose and
mouth.
This added zest to the search, and in the
next mile not a displaced stone or broken
twig but was investieated thoroughly by
the entire party. So other evidence was
obtained until on the broken masses of
uranite which riprap the path of the iron
horse through the great Yolo basin and
prevent the wash of the wind-driven waves
from displacing the road ballast were
fonnd the splashes of blood that marked
the spot where the body of the dead rob
ber was found.
Here the party again entered the train
and started back for the spot where the
mask was found. Passing this the train
moved slowly cityward, the platforms of
the car peopled by eager watchers.
While passing over a trestle a shout was
heard, and Detective Henry Alter pointed
to the dense grass below and signalea to
stop the train. This was done, and Alter
climbed down the woodwork and picked
np a ha!f of a barley sack containing
enough dynamite to have blown an entire
; trai-n to fragments. On either side of the
( sack a rope had been fastened, that it
â  could be slung over the shoulder for ease
!in carrying. That the package had been
! thrown off the rapidly moving train by
; the robbers when they found that their
j plan had miscarried was plainly evidenced
| by the fact that the heavy package had
j forced its way through the densely matted
â  grass for several inches from the spot
j where it had struck. That it did not ci-
I plode is cause for wonderment.
The dynamite had been carefully pre
pared in graduated packages, consisting of
. one-half stick, two-third stick, three
: fourths stick and one-sixth stick Darcels,
tied together with heavy tarred twine,
: with fuse and caps inserted ready for tir
! ing, showing plainly that it had been the
intention of tae robbers to blow open the
: c&r and sates.
Nothing more was found, and a few
: minutes later the party arrived in Sacra
mento.
It is known that the dead ontlaw's name
l was F. J. Morgan, and that he hailed from
: San Francisco. His body was found at
the spot where, according to Engineer
: Ingles, the outlaw had been shot and had
i fallen from tne cab. Shortly after the
; news of the attempted robbery reached
â¢ the eft? a posse was organized and left for
j this spot on a special engine. Policeman

the engine and Detective Ahem on the

train was stopped, and the posse dis
mounted. The officers went back over the
track and found the dead robber, lying
face downward, on an immense piece of
j granite that had been placed there as pro
â  tection against the overflow of water. He
, gave his last gasp as Officer Talbot
reached his side. Grasped in the outlaw's
hand was a cocKed revolver, with ons
I chamber empty.
The bandit was about 35 years of age
i and a splendid specimen of physical man
! hood. He is nearly six feet tall and of
athletic build. He had a bountiful sup
ply of dark brown hair, cut pompadour,
i and his half-opened mouth, shaped ap

a substantial suit of gray tweed and a silk
handkerchief encircled the collar of his
negligee shirt. His underclothing, whiie
not of the extensive kind, was clean and
evidently new. He wore button s^.oes and
a black felt hat. In his pockets were
many articles, including a number of
i cartridges, a clean towel, a piece of soap
and a comb.
The most important discovery, how
ever, was a small and dainty memoran
dum book, with celluloid covers, in which
various entries bad been made. In the
book was a card of "Henry's saloon, 307

CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 6.â Major Mc-
Kinl?y attended communion service at
the Methodist Cnurch this morning, and
remained at home ail of the afternoon and
evening, forgoing his customary drive.
His near neighbors and some of his young
frieniis who have musical talent dropped

tributed to the musical effect.
Mnjor McKiniey has received a large
number of telegrams to-day. They come
from all parts of the country, and indicate
great activity among Republicans and
McKiniey Democrats. One telegram an
nounces that i he Republicans of Dayton,
Ohio, desire to vis-it Canton on Saturday
next, and another reiates to the visit of
the Commercial Men's Democratic Mc-
Kiniey Club of Chicago. This organiza
tion, comprising lOuO commercial men
who have never voted any other than the
Democratic tiefcet, will be here on Satur
day. The club was organized six weeks
ago, and is growing daily. Its members
are all opposed to ;ree silver, ana believe
the election of McKiniey will restore con
fidence and Improve Business.
The following telegram was received
yesterday :

Delegations are coming in large num
bers from all parts of the country, and no
day goes by without bringing letters of
inquiry respecting dates for proposed
visits. Major McKinl y said to the corre
spoi.dent ol the United Associated Presses
to-day that he is always exceedingly glad
to have delegations come to Canton to
see him, but it would be more convenient
in many ways if it could be arranged to
have not more than two parties of visitors
arrive on the same day. Delegations
which contemplate coming to Canton
should try to arrange the time ot their
coming so as not to bring visitors from
too many places here on the same day.
This can be done by telegraphing to Can

Tuesday will be an interesting day here.
The editors of Ohio hold the annual met-t

are to be addressed by Charles Emory
Smith and other newspaper editors.
They will also call upon Major McKiniey
and hp will make a speech to them. This

DRAGGED FROM JAIL AT NIGET
Taken to a Rridge on the Outskirts
of Glencoe and Suspended by
the Nek.
GLENCOE, Mi**.. Sept. 3.â At twenty
minu'es after 1 o'clook this morning
Charles Cinquemars and Dorman Mus
grove, murÂ»iÂ»-rers of Sheriff Rogers, were
handed to the railroad bridge, less than a
quarter of a mile out of town. One of the
men was hanged from the north side ot
the bridge and the other from the south
side. Tne deed was done by about 100
citizens of McLeod County, who thus ex
pre~s?d their disapproval of yesterday's
V'-rdirt sending one of the murderers to
Siate Prison for life instead of being sent
to the gallows.
The murder was one of the most cold
blooded in the annals of Minnesota.
Cinquemars and Mu^grove, two tramp
desperadoes, were traveling northward,
according to their own story, to the wheat
fields of North Dakota. A few miles below
Glencoe they accosted a farmer, took pos
session of bis team and drove into town.
On the way up they beat the farmer for
trying to handle his own team.
The farmer reported them to the officers
at Glencoe and a warrant was issued for
the arrest of the men, who by this time
bad disappeared. Rogers took the papers
himself and started in pursuit of the des
peradoes. Just at dusk on the evening of
June 28 he overtook the two men five
miles soutu of Glencoe. Ridine up to
them be said: "Boys, I want you to go
back to Glencoe with me."
"Well, we don't have to," said Mus
grove, as he brought a Winchester rifle to
his shoulder.
Before Sheriff Rogers could say another
word the tramp began firing on him and he
fell down, his body pierced with five bul
lets. Twenty -four hours later the two'
men were captured by a posse of 500 men
in a neij-hborin,; county and taken to
Glencoe. The jail was surrounded by
several hundred men and a lynching
would have occurred but for the prompt
; ction of Governor Clough, who sent out
a company of militia from St. Paul. The
prisoners were immediately taken to St.
Paul and put in jail there.
The trial of the two men for murder in
the first degree opened here about two
weeks ago, with W. W. Erwin for the de
fense. Erwin moved for separate trials,
and the case of Musgrove was taken up
first. The trial closed on Thursday and
at 1 o'clock Friday morninz the jury re
turned with a verdict of murder in the
second degree after being out eight hours.
This, together with the fact that Cinque
mars' trial would have to occur in an
o her county owing to the difficulty ol
securing a jury, incensed a large portion
of trie community, wiio are not backward
in expressing their commendation of the
action of the mob.
The mob consisted of about a hundred
masted men. They came quietly upon
the jail, overpowered the turnkey and the
guards and soon had the men. The guards
were tied and gagged ami did not know
which way the mob went, but it is evident
the murderers were taken directly to the
bridge in the eastern limits ot toe town.
The ropes were made secure to the railing
or crobsb-ams and the two were thrown
over, ons from one side of the Dridge and
the other from the opposite.
When the men wero discovered Cinque
mar's feet were touching the water, fifteen
feet below. The bodies were taken down
at an early hour this morning and are at
present in the city morgue awaiting the
action of the Coroner's jury to-monow.
THE PHILIPPINE REVOLT.
Rebels Hold Strong Positions and the
Troops Fear to Attack Without
Re-enforcements.
MADRID, Sept. 6 âAn official dispatch
from Manila, capital of the Philippine
Islands, received here to-day states that
the rebels in Cavite continue to do much
damage in the island. The places which
have sustained the moat damage are
Ymus and Novelets. The disnatch fur
ther states that the positions occupied by
tiie rebels are strong;, and that it would be
imprudent for the Spanish troops to at
tack them until re-emorcements shall have
arrived.
Tue Spanish officials in the town of Ca
vite have discovered a plot on the part of
the rebels in tiie place to seize the town
vyhile the trooos were on a sortie againsi

posed nngle ders have been arrested and
measures have been taken to protect the
town from enemies within it.

BENTON HARBOR, Mich., Sept. &â
Yore's Opera-house and adjoining build
ings were burned this morning, causing
the death of eleven firemen and injury to
a number of others, and entailing a loss of
$65,000. The killed are:
Frank vVatson, married, of St. Joseph.
Edward H. Gange, married, of St. Jo
seph.
Arthur C. Hill, married, of St. Joseph.
Frank Seaver, married, of St. Joseph.
Robert Rolfe, single, of St. Joseph.
John Hoffman, married, of Benton Har
bor.
Tr.omas Kidd, single, of Benton Harbor.
Frank Woodley, married, of Benton
Harbor.
Will Matter, married, of Benton Har
bor.
Scott Rice of Benton Harbor.
Louis Hoffman, single, of Benton Har
bor.
The seriously injured are:
Ex-Fire-Chief John A. Crawford of Ben
ton Harbor, burned and overcome by heat
and smoke; seriously injured.
Frank Paget of St. Joseph, leg smashed
by falling brick?.
Will Freund of St. Joseph, cut about the
head and burned.
Jack MoCormick of Benton Harbor, legs
brolten and internally injured.
Several others were injured by tailing
walls, but will recover.
Shortly after midnight Yore's Opera
bouse, a large four-story brick structure,
was discovered to be on fire. It had gained
much headway before the alarm was given,
and when the four city departments ar
rived the building was a mass of flames.
The St. Joseph departments were sent
for and arrived soon after. The fire con
tinued to gain on them and was spreading
to other buildings, when the hook and
ladder companies went to the rear of the
building, hoping to be able to direct a
stream into t::e mass of flames from a
second-story window. Hardly had they
arrived there than the wall, with a mighty
crash, came down before them, burying
fifteen men under the red-hot bricks.
Other portions of the wall were weaken
ing, and the rescue of the imprisoned
firemen was deferred for some time, as it
was expected every moment the remain
der of the wall would fall.
Finally some of the crowd rushed into
the mass to rescue the shrieking and
struggling men. Frank Watson of St.
Joseph was the first man reached, but he
was dead, and his body was a mass of
broken bones and mangled flesh. The
search continued until 5 o'clock,* when
the last victim, Arthur Hill, was removed.
They were carried to offices and private
houses, where doctors irom both cities were
in waiting to render aid. Some of them
died en route, and others died while their
wounds were being cared for.
The dead were taken to the City Hall,
which was turned into a temporary
tcor ue. Some of the men were so badly
mangled that identification was possible
only by letters and papers in their pockets.
As the bleeding forms were carried through
the streets they were followed by throngs
of awe-stricken men and women, eager to
learn whether the victim was a friena or
relative. After the falling of the rear
wall, which took with it the lives of at
least eleven men, the roof and other walls
socn collapsed, one of the side walls fall
ing upon a two-story brick building owned
by William Fricfc and completely demol
ishing the structure and its contents of
shoes. , The fire had not been confined
alone to the opera-house, but had crept
MNH the alley, and soon the rear of the
two store buildings was a seething mass
of flames. These, however, were got
under control before they reached the
main part ot the buildings. The fire was
under control by 5 o'clock, and the search
for more bodies was bejun and continued
all day until to-night, when the firemen,
exhausted, gave up the search until to
morrow. The loss as far as can be ascer
tained is: Piiirick Yore, opera-house
blocfc, $50,000; insurance, $19,000.
The occuiunt3 of the several buildings
will lose several hundred dollars. The
origin of the fire is unknown, but Guy
Prescott, who stated to-day that he knew
how the fire started, but was not going to
give any one away, was arrested and will
be brought before the Coroner's jury.
The wardrobe of the Katie Putnam Com
pany, which gave a performance for the
benefit of the firemen last evening, was
also burned, as was the wardrobe of the
Mexican Troubadours, who are spending
their vacation here. Several of the dead
firemen leave large families. Their fun
erals will all be held together Tuesday
and will be under the auspices of the fire
men and fraternal societies of which the
deceased were members.

[Copyrlght,lÃ96,by the United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Germany, Sent. 6.â The con
ferences which have taken place between
tbe Czar and the Emperor and their ac
companying Russian and German diplo
mats, which at first were alleged to be de
void of anything more important than
mere ceremonial conversations, are now
reported to have taken tbe charact r of
initiating a new concert of the powers,
which is to have a bearing of the utmost
importance upon future events in Turkey.
It i 3 not .known definitely who originated
the proposal, but it is, however, a matter
of positive knowledge in Berlin that
Prince Hohenlohe, the Imperial Chancel
lor, and Count yon Osten-Sacken, the
Russian Embassador to Germany, are dis
cussing a plan, the purpose of which is to
place :;ie Sultan under the tutelage of the
Embassadors of the powers in Constanti
nople, who will be empowered to control
the Sultan's selection of Ministers, and
also his appointments of provincial Gov
ernors.
The settlement of the tronbles in Crete
upon the basia of European supervision
seems to have been the keynote of this
scheme, which at least would maintain
the nominal integrity of Turkey, and for
a time enable the powers to escape being
dragged into a European war over the di
vision of the spoils of the Ottoman em
pire. Practically the foreign Embassadors
are already treating Turkey as a Govern
ment existing wholly upon sufferance, but
they do not take the responsibilities which
ought to be aiÂ«iciated with the situation.
Only the bare proposals nave been heard
of outside of the circle which is formulat
ing the scheme, but tbe plan is doubtless
full of difficulties in the way of its work
ing smoothly. One thing, however, is
certain, and that is that both the entour
age of the Kaiser and that of the Czar are
convinced that they can no lonizer re^t
content upon mere diplomatic remon
strances to the Porte, and it is well under
stood tnat family influences upon the
Czar at Copenhagen and similar influ
ences upon the Kaiser at Balmoral have
become insistent beyond precedent in
favor of an effective stoppage of the hor
rors in Turkey; and these influences, it is
believed, may have been the most potent
of all in determining the two Emperors
upon the course which it is now proposed
to pursue.
Dip;omatic advices received from Con
stantinople are such as to cause well
grounded fears here tnat very much worse
things than have already occurred in Con
btantinople may happen in that city before
the Embassadors are able to arrange for
armed intsrvention to suppress disorders;
that the Sultan's palace clique, Jearning
that the Sultan's reign is about to cease,
may organize a massacre upon a very
much larger scale than heretofore, and
which will involve many other persons
than Armenians as its victims.
The reports that the British, French and
Italian warships in TurKish waters have
been re-en forced, while the German war-
Bhips have not, have excited a widespread
feeling of discontent. which is being freely
expressed in the newspapers regardless of
their political bias.
Despite the activity of other powers in
augmenting their naval strength in Turk
ish waters, the admiralty of Germany
has taken no steps to increase the strengt h
and number of tbe German war- vessels
there, but now, apparently goaded by the
utterances of the pres- into doing some- '
thing, they have ordered the training-ship I
Gneisenau to Smyrna and the gunboat j
Ersatz to replace" the old anl wornout
Lorelei on the Constantinople sta:ion.
These measures are extremely poor; in
deed, little better than none at all, if Ger
many is to figure in the intervention of
the powers in front of Constantinople.
The fetes at Breslau in honor of the Czar
and Czarina bear a close resemblance to
all of the preceding demonstrations of the
kind. Tha streets ot tbe town are
thronged with people, who cheer in sea
son and out and y.ersistently press upon
the long lines of troops who occupy the
borders of the streets to keep the crowd
from impeding the progress of the impe
rial visitors and the Kaiser and Kai->erin,
with their suites, as they pass.
The heat yesterday and to-day was in
tense, and served to increase the general
discomfort of the people. Hiah prices for
every conceivable thing for which there

Outlaw Morgan's Confederates.
was the slightest demand were the rule.
The grand old city was draped from end
to end and the main thoroughfares were
profusely decorated with every kind of
drapery, banner, etc,, that could be found
suitable to the occasion. Flags, festoons
of bunting and rough but striking pic
torial shields of Silesia and Germany,
paintings of the Kaiser and Czar and
rudely painted mottoes and expressions
of welcome were to be seen at every street
corner. Some of the decorations, how
ever, were very handsome and artistic.
The Municipal Council voted the sum of
100.000 marks for the purpose of providing
decorations, and those purchased under
these auspices were very fine.
As a whole, the decorations of Breslau
were far more elaborate man those seen
by the Russian imperial party in Vienna.
The thousands of visitors to Breslau, in
cluding the army of press representatives,
have reason to regret the limited accom
modations of the city.
The military and civil officials filled
what few small hotels there were avail
able and the visitors had to shift for them
selves as best they could. It was origin
ally intended that the Czar and Czarina
with their suits should occupy the royal
castle, but the Emperor's court marshal,
who was in charge of the arrangements,
found that the castle would be too small
to hold both ol the imperial visitors and
their attendants, so the new house of the
Silesian Landtag, in course of erection,
was hurriedly ordered to be completed
within the three weeks remaining prior to
the reception of the Czar. Accordingly a
force of 800 workmen were employed uight
and day in gettfug the building and its
approaches in a passable and tit condition,
and it was only on Friday, the day before
the Czar's arrival, that they ceased work.
A representative of the United Asso
ciated Presses, who was permitted to in
spect Die interior of the build* ng on Fri
day, found a dominant sense of newness
everywhere, and the raw ortors ot new
wood, paint, etc., pervaded the place.
Still the imperial apartments were
gorgeous with tapestries, pictures, etc.,
which had been transferred to the buiki
ing from tne royal palaces of Prussia and
presented a beautiful spectacle. The
grand reception-room wiiica waa con
structed within the central hall was
adorned with statuary and tropical plants.
In this hall the Czar and Czarina held a
reception Saturday evening, receiving the
Kaiser, tne Kaiserin and the Silesian
noble.<, and here also the Russian visitors
gave a luncheon to-day (Sunday), at which
the Kaiser and Kaiserin and a select num
ber of members of the official circle were
present.
The nature of the friendship of the two
Emperors as cemented by the meeting of
tiie mouarchs in Breslau is shown by the
fact thai the Kaiser will go to Darmstadt
on October 8, wnen the Czar and Czarina
are there. Upon that occasion there will
be a family conclave and several impoitant
functions will be held, functions that will
I be very elaborate, for Darmstadt at least.
j The imperial parties will stay at the
Residenz cchloss.
During their visit to Darmstadt the
Czar, the Emperor and the Grand Duke of
Hesse will go on a hunting trip on October
10 to Jagdschloss and Wolfsgarten. From
| tne latter place they will return to Jagd
| schioss for another day's hunting and then
they will go to Rociroed in the Upper
Hesse for tiie same purpose. The Czarina
will remain with tne Grand Duchess of
Hesse, her sister-in-law, for ten days while
her husband is absent on his hunting trip.
The Czarina during her stay with the
Grand Duchess will as a rule remain quiet,
but her visit will be varied with gala per
| formances eiven in her honor at the
Darmstadt Opera-house and visits to the
local institutions, including the Princess
Alice Frauen Verein. The tour of the
Czar will conclude with his visit to Darm
.stadt, and it is quite probable that France
may notLke the prospect of her great ally
i spending a fortnight in close relations
' with her most watctiul foe almost imme
diately after his reception in Paris.
The row between Herr Liebknecht and
the editorial staff of the Vorwaerts is still
unsettled, and as a result of the trouble
the Socialist Congress which is to be held
at Sieblichen, near Gotha, on October 11,
is likely to be the scene of some lively
personal encounters.
Prince Eitel Frederick, tne second son
of the Emperor, who is pursuing his
studies at the Ploen College, was thrown
from his horse a few days ago and received
a kick in the leg which has obliged the
youngster to remain in bed ever since.
It is reported that General yon Hahnke,
the chief of the Kaiser's military cabinet,
will succeed General yon Loe to the com
mand of the Brandenburg Corps and the
Governorship of Berlin. The appointment
has not yet been officially announced, but
it is an official fact, proving lialmke'.-s
jio ition as a favorite of the Emperor, that
he has been appointed chief of the Twelfth
Regiment of infantry.
Ihe congress of the Austrian Catholics
jusi held a: Salzburg was notable for the
presence of Count Thun, who in his capa
city of Governor, expressed the wish that
the programme oi the congress might be
carried out. This programme included a
declaration in lavor of the restoration of
the temporal nower of the Holy See, and
the Austrian Liberals are in a rage at the
action of Count Thun, believing that a
rapprochement of the Government with
the clerical coalition will become a ques
tion before the lieichsratb at the opening
of the session of that body early in
October.
The field church service, which was in
tended to be iield at Breslau this morning,
was abandoned both on account of the
heavy rain and because the Czar was
latigued as the result of yesterday's func
tions. The lew words spoken by the
Czar in responding to the Emperor's
toast at the banquet last evening are re
carded in official circles as having been
lacking in wamtb, and as a purely perfunc
tory recognition of the traditional senti
ments exis;ing between the imperial
bouses of Germany and Russia.
The lact, too, that he replied in the
French language instead of the German,
with wuicti he is as familiar as the Kaiser
himself, is construed by the officials as
bavin- been intended as a check to Ger
many's aims at closer relations with
Russia.
Last evening sixty cases of fractured
limbs were treated at the hospital on the
Grandau Parade promd and In the Red
Cross stations as a result of the crush of
spectators to witness tbe parade.
On Friday night over 100 oimiliar cases
were treated in the various hospitals in
the city.

WHISKY DEALS IN
SOUTH CAROLINA
How State Officials Fatten
Under the Dispensary
System.
GOVERNOR EVANS TALKS
Forced by Political Exigencies
to Expose Some of His
Friends.
REBATES FROM LARGE FIRMS.
Concealed Crookedness That Will
Probably Cost His Excellency a
Seat in tbe Snate.
COLUMBUS, 8. C, Sept. 6.â One of the
biggest State scandals that has occurred
since the days of negro rule in South Car
olina was sprung last night by Governor
Evans. If his statement is correct the
dispensary system seems to have been a
gold mine to those in charge of it.
Governor Evans, it teems, has been in
possession of the information he has given
for a long time. It was entirely unex
pected, and it appears that the Governor's
exposure was due to the fact that he had
been goaded for not denying a charge
made on the stump in his campaign for
the Senate that he had said that Tillman
had lined his pockets with liquor rebates.
Tbis thing had acted so strongly upon the
former friends of Evans and Tillman that
defeat threatened the former in the race
for the Senate.
The election comes off Friday. Evans
held off until 1 o'clock this morning, when
he came out with a denial of the state
ment. He explains that he held back the
denial upon bad advice, and then pro
ceeds to make his revelations. Commis
sioner Mixson and the Commissioner's
son, an official court stenographer, are the
objects of his ire. The Governor asserts
that presents were sent Mixson by whisky
houses and that Mixs >n's son bad also ac
cepted valuable presents. He had called
Mixson up, he says, when it was first dis
covered, and warned him that the dispen
sary would be killed if any scandal was
ever connected with its management.
Then he says:
"Shortly afterwards Mr. Scruggs, the
bookkeeper, reported to me that from let
ters he had received and opened In Mix
son's absence in the course of business and
other suspicious circumstances he was
satisfied that Mixson was dealing with
certain whisky houses exclusively and
was obtaining rebates in consideration
thereof. I replied to him that he was a
State officer as well as Mixson and Toinp
kins, and that if he saw anything going
wrong it was his duty to inform me and
to secure the evidence to convict them.
Mr. Scrupgs reported to m* that he was
satisfied that he could secure the evidence
to convict thes.- men if I would allow him
to leave the State. X replied to htm that
he could go whenever and wherever he
pleased on such a mission."
After telling of his discovery that Mix
son was paying higher prices to one house
than other bouses offered the goods, he
proceeds to tell of a visit of Mixson's son to
Cincinnati, where he was entertained by
whisky people, and adds:
"I may have ma<le a mistake in not
giving this expose sooner, but I have been
deceived by these people and badly ad
vised by my friends, who assured me that
the public took no stock in their state
ments. 1 may be criticised for not reply
ing sooner, but I have injured no one
save myself. It is with reluctance that I
do this now, because 1 know how it will be
used by the enemies of the dispensary law
and the reform movement.
â¢'But in justice to ray friend*, who re
quested it, and the public, I make this
statement. The parties connected with
this matter are not interested in this
primary, but have another tribunal to
which they can and must appeal."
To-night Commissioner Mixson and his
son make statements. The latter ac
knowledges that he collected for his
brother $740 50 in wiiisky rebates from t..e
Live Oak Distillins Company, but that
their father knew nothing of it.
Colonel Mixson, in his card, accuses tbe
Governor's brother of a disposition to
enter into the business of which his son is
accused and declares that several of the
Governor's statements are false.
YOLO BAN DITS
KNOWN TO LEES
Oontinued from Flrtt Page.
back of this was written, "F. J. Morgan,
one typewriter, Yost No. 2, paid $25." In
the book were several entries of money
paid on the typewriter, all signed "F. J.
M.," and this gave rise to the belief that
the name of the dead man was F. J. Mor
gan, which is now proved beyond a doubt.
While a critical examination was being
made of the body and the effects, a soft
whistle sounded from the darkness.
The officers sprang to their feet and or
dered the person sounding the summons
to approach. A roughly dressed man en
tered the circle of light given by the few
flickering lamps. He was decidedly agi
tated, and at once stated that he had
taken part in the hold-up. His story was
a most interesting one.
"My name is Edward Burke, be said.
"I have been working for a man named Ui
stine, at Dixon, my employment being
bucking sacks. When we got through my
partner and I started for Sacramento, in
search of another job. We had just crossed
the new trestle to-night when I Baw two
men sitting along the railroad track.
When we came near them I said: 'Hello,
partners,' and was going along when they
arose, oue armed with a rifle and the
other a pistol. One of the men wore a
mask, and he asked:
" 'Wliat have you there?'
" "Only our blanket?,' I replied.
" 'Throw them down the embankment,'
he shouted.
"We did as requested, as their guns
were leveled at us, and the men then told
us what was wanted. They said they pro
posed to hold up a traiii, soon to pass, and
that if we did not assist they would kill us.
" 'if you do as we say it will oe all right
with you, and if you don't it will be
wrong,' said one of tt>e men.
"I was then asked if I knew how to un
couple cars. I said that I could pull a pin
in a freight train, but that was all. The
man douuted my word, but explained how
to uncouple passenger-cars, describing the
airbrakes, hooks and levers. Then one of
the men took me to one side of the track,
and my partner and the other man re
mained on the opposite side. Presently
the train approached, and one of the men
said:
\ *.' 'I wonder if he has fixed things all
right? 1 and an instant later he exclaimed:
'Yes; It's all right.'
."I think that there must have been a
signal from somebody on the train, for my
man said to me, 'Now, go ahead and do
as you were told.' I went back to the ex
press-car and tried to uncouple the fasten
ings, but the lever would not work. My
partner tried to help me, but it was no go.
Then the shooting commenced, and I said
to my partner, .'Shall we jump?' and he
said 'Yes,' and we plunged into the tules
and underbrush.
"After the train pulled out I called for
my partner, but he did not answer; sol
ran to the section-house, toward Davis
ville. I told them what had happened,
and informed the conductor of a train that
had been nagged that there was a dead
man down the track, but little attention
was paid to my statements."
The result of this morning's search has
been to assure the railroad detectives that
the robbers, after finding their plans ren
dered abortive, threw away all incrimi
nating evidence, and knowing that the
train running at the speed it was must be
too close to the city for any attempt at re
venge on Engineer Ingles they passed over
the tops of the coaches to one of the rear
platforms, entered a coach unperceived,
seated themselves and quietly rode into
the city and disappeared. It is known
that the identity of the two men is in the
possession of the railroad officials and it
is likely their capture will shortly be ef
fected. This knowledge was obtained by
tracing the movements of the dead man
from the transportation ticket found on
his body, which proved that he had left
San Francisco on the morning of the rob
bery.
That Morgan has been at different times
in this city is also known, as he has been
identified by several of the numerous visi
tors to the morgue as a man they saw in
various drinking resorts.
â¦
OUTLAN'S MORGAN TIPENEITER.
Its Connection With the Cn*e Puzzle*
Chief of Detective* Zee*.
The dead train robber was positively
identified last night by Captain Lees as
F. J. Morgan, who formerly frequented
a saloon on East street, near Market.
About noon yesterday Superintendent
John Wright of the Sacramento division
telephoned Captain Lees that the robber
had memoranda on nis person which
made it appear that his name was Morgan
and that be baa been a frequent visitor at
the East-street saloon. Detectives Wrenn
and Uib-on were detailed on the case.
Tney found a typewriter in a rear room
on which was a card bearing Morgan's
name.
The saloon man said that Morgan had
left the machine there himself. He told a
story in substance as follow: "Morgan
first visited the saloon two years ago.
Sometimes be would go away for two or
three days, saying he was going into the
country. Five days a^o he went to the
saloon with a stout man about 35 years of
age and 5 feet 10 inche- in heigdt. Th
stranger wore dark clothes, had a dark
mustache and was of adecidelv dark com
plexion.
"They left together at 4:30 p. m. and
Morgan said they were f;oing to Stockton
on the boat. Before leaving Morgan took
a small bundle wrapped in paper which
he had left there two days before. Mor
gan always carried a large pistol.
"He also iiad a second companion, a
young feilow not more than 20 years of
age, with a smooth face. This youth was
about 5 !eet 9 inches tall, and always ap
peared the best dressed of the trio. On
the day that Morgan and his elder part
ner went away the young feilow wore a
li^ht tweed suit and a black Derby hat.
He was last seen with Morgan two days
before the latter left town. The three
were never seen together at once."
The police believe that the whole plot
to rob the train beyond Sacramento had
been hatched in this City by this trio, and
that they left five days since by different
routes. This was for the purpose of avoid
ing suspicion.
Captain Lets would like to have the
mystery of the type-writing machine ex
plained. Mcrgau used to take the ma
chine away for a short time and then
bring it back to the saloon. He got it
three months ago on the installment plan
from a local agent. But what he did with
it is still a question.
The detectives will now lend their ef
forts toward identifying the two com
panions of Morgan, as upon that identifi
cation much depends in the hunt for the
escaped highwaymen, who are now sup
posed to be at larce in the Sacramento
Valley or the foothills.
Tne police have no record whatever of
Morgan other than the story told by the
water-front saloon-keepers. Morgan went
almost daily to Oakland, but the object of
these trips across the bay could not be
learned. He was extremely reticent and
but little inclined to speak about any
thing to strangers, much less about him
self. He was last seen in San Francisco
on Tuesday.

by Thievery.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Kept. 6.â A round-up
of alleged cattle thieves lias been made by
local officers, and four out of about nine
that have been much sought for in the
past eight months are locked up in the
County Jail. The alleged offenders were
encaged in a big job last December and
were successful in eluding arrest until yes
terday.
On the 20th of last December F. Brad
ford missed thirty-two fine cattle from his
range about twelve miles southeast of this
city, near the Monterey road. There were
several hundred cattle on the range at the
time and Bradford would not have de
tected the loss] of a portion of his stock
if he bad not missed from among them
two very fine Holstein heifers which he
had purchased a short time before from R.
J. Langford. The owner was very proud
of this pair and when he noted their
absence from the herd he ordered a round
up and discovered that the two heifers and
thirty more of the choicest among his
cattle were gone. At about the same time
K. J. Langford missed two cows from his
range, and from C. Fisher's herd on a
range near by five had disappeared. All
of the cattle missed were the finest stock
in the several herds, as though they had
been picked out by an expert cattle dealer
to supply a fastidious trader.
The loss of the stock was reported to the
officers, but no trace could be found for
several months either of the thieves or the
missing cattle. The indications at the
time made it certain that the job was a
bold one. The cattle were evidently
driven out of Bradford's rield through a
big >;ate onto tt.e Monterey road, which
was, in fact, the only means of egress.
The work was, of course, done at night.
Vaeue reports v/ere received of a herd
of cattle that was driven toward San Jose
after night, but if it bad been a phantom
herd the information could not have been
more indefinite. Developments several
months subsequent to the discovery of the
loss of the cattle made it certain that they
were driven 10 this city and disposed of
here and at Santa Clara. Most of the
stock was in fine condition for beef, and
as good beef was in demand at that time,
shortly before Christmas, they were un
doubtedly slaughtered and sold at the va
rious shops in this city. This was the
reason that no trace of hide or hair of
them could be obtained by the officers.
Five fine milch cows were not slaugh
tered, however, and it was their discovery
and identification that first gave a clew to
the supposed thieves. Two of the cows
were sold to W. A. Phipps, who owns a
dairy on the Polhemus tract, and three
were sold to a dairyman near Santa Clara.
These cows were identified by R. J. Lang
ford, who had himself sold several of them
to Bradford shortly before they were
stolen. From the date they were sold it
was certain that the cattle must have been
run off the range about December 12-
It was learned that Francisco Vedal was
the man who had sold the cattle. Of
course, Vedal was then suapected of being
connected with the theft, and a search for
him was begun. It was known that his
Home was in !*an Luis Obispo County, and
he had not been in San Jose for more than
a year before the theft of the cattle. Dur
ing that time he wooed and won a Mexi
can maid named Miss Gavilan, who re
sided with her parents on Whitton street
in East San Jo*e.
The marriage of Vedal and Miss Gavilan
took place on Christmas, shortly after the
successful cattle raid, and afterward, when
the connection of the groom with the deal
was discovered, it was supposed by officers
that Vedal had devoted some of the pro
ceeds of the sale to the expenses of merry
making at the wedding. It i 3 also said
that some very choice roast beef was
among thÂ© delicacies at the marriage
feast.
Vedal did not remain in San Jose long
after his marriage. He purchased a two
horse team and wagon and he and his wife
began to travel leisurely toward his home
in San Luis Obispo County. Alonz the
road Vedal changed his name at various
points, and when the officers finally got
on bis track it was hard to trace him. He
would atay at one place for several weeks
and sometimes for a month at a time, doÂ»
ing odd . jobs of work and making deals in
horses and cattle. Finally, a few days
ago, he reached a point on the Santa Mar
garita ranch about fifteen miles from his
home in San juiis Obispo County. There
Sheriff Mai hews got trace of Vedal through
the descriptions of him and information
sent by Sheriff Lyndon.
The fact that Vedal had a younÂ» wife
with him helped the officers in the search,
and he and his brother, Ed Vedal, were
arrested. on Friday by Sheriff Mathews.
They were turned over to Sheriff Lyndon
in this city last evening and locked up in
the County Jail.
After his arrival in San Jose Vedal was
identified at the County Jail by R. J.
Langford, who knew him when he was in
San Jose. Vedal was much changed in
appearance, as he had shaved nis mus
tache and cut his hair in a different style,
but he was easily identified. He denied
that he had stolen the cattle, or even
knew that they were stolen. He claimed
that be bought the stock from a man who,
he supposed, was the owner.
Shortly after the Vedals were locked up
another man, who is supposed to be a
member of the gang, was arrested. He
gave his name as George Davis.
This evening Deputy Sheriff Gardner
returned from San Francisco with a fourth
prisoner, who is believed to be the leader
of the gang. He gave his name as John
Blank, but he was known as Gilbert when
he lived in Santa Clara County several
years ago. Francisco Vedal claims that
he bought the cattle from Slank. The
brother of Francisco Vedal, who was ar
rested, says his true name is Sanoyia
Vedal. He claims that he is entirely in
nocent of the theft. The Vedals say they
will give bail and secure their release when
they are arraigned upon the charge in the
Justice's court to-morrow.
The officers are searching for five other
men, believed to have belonged to the
gang.
SALINAS PIGEON SHOOT,
Marksmen of Four Cities Meet

First Honors Won by the Home Team,
WitlnGilroy Secondâ A Spanish
Barbecue.
SALINAS. Cal., Sept. aâ Fully 3000
people attended the pigeon shoot to-day
at Torro Shooting Park. The meet was
under the auspices of the Salinas City Rod
and Gun Club. Four clubs participated,
Watsonville, Gilroy, Mouterey and Sa
linas, each having ten men.
The Watsonville and Gilroy teams ar
rived at 11:20 o'clock, and the Monterey
club a little later. The captains immedi
ately chose the men to represent them,
and lots were drawn to determine which
team would shoot first. A sweepstake
shoot waa the first event of the day. Sali
nas won the rim round, Monterey the
second and Gilroy the third.
An old-fashioned Spanish barbecue was
spread under the trees adjacent to the
shotting park at noon, and not only
cooked beef but all kinds of Spanish
dishes were served to the hungry shooters
and their friends.
It was nearly 2 o'clock before the regu
lar events began. The final score gave
Salinas first prize, with 183 bluerocks, Gil
roy second, Monterey third and Watsou
viile fourth. The highest individnai score
was made by George White, who broke 20
out of a possible 25 birds. James JefTery
was a close second, with 19 to his credit.

Hunt; Chang and party arrived in this city
at 11:45 o'clock this morning, accompanied
by the United States army officers who are
escorting the party about the country.
They came direct from Washington in "a
handsomely appointed Pullman vest ibuled
train of seven coaches.
About 3:30 o'clock the start was made to
see the falls. The rain had ceased and the
sun was shining brightly. Tliousands of
people hlled the hotel corridors, verandas
and the street outside. The falls reached,
the Viceroy watched them for a short
time, his face bearing a curious expression.
He turned to his interpreter and addressed
him. The latter said: "His Excellency
is very much delighted and greatly im
pressed."
Next the party were driven to the pow
er-house of the Cataract Construction
Company, where they saw the monster
5000-horsepower dynamos running by the
energy of the Niagara River.
Li spoke through his interpreter in glow
ing terms of American enterprise, and
said the sight was the most interesting he
had seen on his travels. He inquired the
cost of the work and the revenue and
other things. The party then returned to
the hotel.
The interpreter said Li marveled much
at the American railways, saying mey
were the greatest he had ever seen.
Asked if Li would, udo:i his return to
China, have the English engineers who
are building a railroad in that country
adopt the American system, he said he
certainly would. This important an
nouncement was received with much en
thusiasm by the many prominent men in
hearing distance.
At the powerhouse Li held out his cane
toward one of the rapidly revolving dy
namos and it was hit by a projection an>i
knocked out of his hand like a flash. He
was startled but snid nothing. He canw
near being badly injured by the occurrence!

Dear Sirâ l want you to let people know
â what your Belt nas done for me. When I
bought it last December I was troubled with a
continual pain in the bnck and sometimes ex-
tending up to the shoulder blades. I had been
troubled for years and had tried everything in
the line of doctors and advertised remedies
without relief. I was also very constipated
ana ha i to take laxatives every day. 1 finally
made up my mind to try one of your Belts and
lam glad I did go. In about three weeks after
putting the Bell on all the pain had gone, and
I have felt none Â«ince. My back is now strong
and will stand all the I rain 1 can put on it
without hurting. My bowels are as regular as
clockwork, and I have gained ten pounds in
weight. I shall always speak well of your
Belt, for it has done for me what nothing els*
could do. I think it la the best thing ever in-

TIBURON. Cal., Sept. 6.â More than
5000 people attended the clambake to-day.
The affair was a gastronomic success
Ev6ry one had all he wanted to eat and
thoroughly enjoyed what he got. The
balloon did not co up, but the people did
not care about looking into the heavens.
Tue baking pits sufficed.
George Crowell, who supervised the baK
ing of the c'.ams and the preparing of the
chicken and corn, displayed an art seldom
excelled in his particular line. Something
over 200 bucketfuls of clams were served,
besides 2000 heads of corn, 1500 pieces of
chicken wrapped in cheese cloth a-ia-ta
male form, and 200- loaves of bread were
buttered.
â Â±"he railroad company ran four extra
boats from San Francisco and one extra
train from San Rafael. The Sausaiito
band, consisting of fifteen pieces, under
Leader Cramer, began playing at 11
o'clock. Simultaneously Thomas Mitch
ell, assisted by fourteen men, commenced
the distribution of the edibles. By 2
o'clock the pits were emptied and every
body was thoroughly satisfied. Tooth
picks were then at a premium and the
remainder of the afternoon was devoted
to retrospection and to witnessing the
games.
The tug-of-war prize of ?15 was contested
(or by the Tiburon and Petaluma teams,
eaca consisting of nine men. After a pro
longed strain of twenty minutes the battle
was won by the Tiburons.
The teams were manned as follows:
Tiburons â Captain W. Fmlayson (anchor
man), Robert McQueen, Ed Creighton,
William Barry, Juaeph Emeral, James
McQuade, Charles, Madderson, Dinny
Luzy, Joe Powers; Petalumas â Captain
Harry Unna, John Gurnoy, Joe Hahir,
Tom Curry, Joe Dutra, George Fern,
Denny Burns, Emmanuel Dutra.
One of the most interesting and thrill
ing features ot the festivities was the ex
hioition drill of the he-saving crew of
Jiburon. George Perris and \V. Goody
rode out in a smail boat, and when some
hundred yards from shore were over
turned into the water.
The lifeboat wen: quickly to their as
sistance ana brought them safely to
shore. The boat was manned by George
Bonner (captain), J. E. Amarel, J. de
Wolfe, J. McQuade, J. T. Creighton and
C. Kriem er. 4
The boatrace did not take place.
The officers having charge of the good
time were: Jerry O'Connell, president;
Thomas Mitchell, secretary; N. R. Han
son, treasurer; George Crowell. caterer;
Joseph Amarel. boatracing; William Fin
layson. games and tug-of-war; Harry
Unna and Gus Schiller, masters of cere
monies; "Jack"' Maher, marshal of the
day. Sheriff Harrison with his constables
was also present to see that perfect order
was maintained.
S TURMS IN THE NIERRA.
Thunder, Liohininrj and Bain Cause an
Â£.jcndua of Campers.
SUMMIT, Cal., Sept. 6. â One of the
fiercest storms, in years has prevailed in
this vicinity during the past two days.
Considering the season, its coming was
remarkable. Rain has fallen in torrents
at ciose interval?, followed by a most
beautiful electrical display. The moun
tains, as far as the eye could see, have
been lighted up, the deep canyons re
sembling seas of fire, while the thunder
echoes were enough to frighten the
bravest. A telegraph operator at Cascade
was this afternoon knocked from his chair
t.nd severely burned by lisrhtnine striking
a switchboard, which rebounded, striking
him full in the face.
Old mountaineers prognosticate an early
and severe winter. Sam Jacous, a veteran
Western Union lineman, who has made
this place his home for more than a score
of years, said to-day: "1 knoj? this moun
tain as well as any living man, and if
snow is not piled mountains high before
the new year then I am willing to take a
back seat as a weather prophet. This
lightning and thunder mean something,
and that something is a genuine Sierra
winter."
The scattering which the storm caused
among tourists camped hereabouts was
genera!. Rain soaked through canvas
tents, drenching the inmates, baggage,
provisions and all. Those who were ex
periencing their first pleasures of moun
tain life were frightened almost to death
by the electrical display.
PACIFIC GROTE'S ASSEMBLY.
Jieli'jious Session H*ld by the Itinerant*!
1 tub Students.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Sept. 6.â The
Itinerants' Club held what it called a re
ligious session to-day, the students dcliv -
ering short addresses during the after
noon, and the entire club discussing the
main points after e%ch speech or lecture.
In the morning they listened to an able
sermon by the Rev. Dr. F. F. Jewell in th â 
Methodist Church. His argument was
directed to the club, and particularly the
members of the graduating class, who
would enter the California Conference on
Wednesday morning as regular members
of that general uodv. He gave them some
good and clear ideas of what work they
would be called unon to do and what was
expected of them during this session.
Rev. A- H. Nudana, secretary of the
club, preached this evening.

HIS TO WEAR A
BISHOP'S MITER
Installation of Right Rev.
George Montgomery
at Los Angeles.
PRIESTS KISS HIS HAND
Inducted Into the High Office
With Solemn Pomp and
Ceremony.
FEAST OF MARTYRED VIBIANA
Catholics of the Southern Diocese
Welcome the Venerable Mora's
Successor.
Los Angeles Office of the Call,/
328 South Broadway, [â 
Los Angeles, Cal., Sept. 6. )
A notable event in the history of the
RIGHT REV. GEORGE MONTGOMERY, Who Succeeds Bishop Mora as the Head of the Catholic
Diocese of Los Angeles and Monterey.
Catholic cnurch of this coast was the in
stallation to-day of Right Rev. George
Montgomery as Bishop of Monterey and
Los Angeles, to which high office he was
elevated upon the resignation of Bishop
Mora.
Bishop Mora, who has held the office
for many years, is the last of a long and
illustrious line of Spanish Bishops who
have had charge of this diocese, which is
composed of forty parishes. Crowned
with honors he will soon retire to the in
terior of Spain, where he will end his de
clining years.
The cathedral was handsomely pre
pared for to-day's ceremonies, and was
packed with people from the altar to the
doors. Folly 1500 witnessed the beautiful
and Impressive rites. Many priests of the
diocese were present. It was the final
celebration of the Pontifical mass since
Bishop Montgomery assumed the duties
of Bishop.
The procession of clergymen and bear
ers of the canopy which sheltered the
Bishop formed at 10:30 o'clock at the
Bishop's residence and proceeded to the
main entrance of the cathedral. The
canopy-bearers were: Hon. Zach Mont
gomery, John F. Francis, John Keneally,
Mr. Stefan, George Kodriquez ana Joseph
Mess mer. The procession was met at the
entrance by Vicar-General Adam and the
acolytes, who tendered the holy water to
the Bishop to be blessed of him. A3 the
company entered the main aisle the choir
sang the Te Deum. The Vicar-General
offered a prayer. 1 hen the Bishop was
conducted to the episcopal throne, where
one by one the priests went forward to
kiss his hand, when the Bishop proceeded
to the altar and pronounced his solemn
benediction.
The celebration of the solemn Pontifical
mass was then begun. During the mass
Rev. Peter C. Yorke of San Francisco de
-1 ivered an able sermon.
At the close of the installation cere
monies the priests and a company of
prominent laymen tendered Bishop Mont
gomery a banquet in his house, at which
Vicar-General Adam presided. Addresses
were made by John Keneally, Fathers
Yorke, Bartnepp and Adam and Bishop
Montgomery. Very holy vespers were
held in the cathedral at 4 o'clock this
afternoon, presided over by the newly in
stalled Bishop. This evening Father
Yorke delivered a lecture in the cathedral
entitled. "The Chained Bible."
Father Yorke's forenoon sermon was in
part as follows :
Sly Dear Brethren: The celebration of two
events has brought us together nere to-day â
the one of somewhat restricted and local in
terest, the observance of the memorial day of
the patroness saint of this diocese of Monterey
and Los Aneeles ana of this church; the other
of great interest to this parish, to this com
munity, but also of importance to the entire
State of California, to the country and to the
church generally, and that is the installation
of your new Bishop, the Rt. Rev. George Mont
gomery. It is not a mere coincidence that
these two events should come together.
The Catholic ohurch is a historic church as
well as one of promise. Its face is set toward
the future, but the church never forgets the
Â«lgrious past, Hera is tte very substance of
things for which we hope and is also the glory
of things that are and have been. The church
stands like a great tree that uplifts and throws
its arm toward heaven and which flourishes In
its life-giving sunlight and its balmy breezes.
But the storms may arise, the rains pour
down in torrents, the gales attack It, all in
vain to its detriment, for its roots are firmly
fixed in the past, and the harder the blowi
and the attacks the more Is added to her
strength and sustenanoe. The grand old
church looks forward with hope and serenity.
It has no fear of what may come, no anxiety
about the future, because her feet are set on
the Rock oi Ages, and as sure as there Is a
I God In heaven they never can be moved.
So to-day, when we celebrate the memory of
one who figured in the opening history of the
church and the added responsibility of an
other who is toiling for It and for numanlty,
our minds look forward to ever Increasing
possibilities of the church, to the millions
who must come to it for hope, for mercy, for
safety, and again our thoughts will wander
back to the era of the martyrs, to the time
when the fathers were contending, as we are
now, against worldliness, against sin, against
j error, and we see that in all eras the church ia
the same.
We see that the spiritual fruit, the flowers,
the verdure that we all enjoy to-day, was
watered and matured by the blood of martyrs.
When we come to consider a saiut like Vibiaua
and find tbst there is absolutely nothing
known about her, the gap is something of a
shock to the seeker for detail. AH that we
know of Viblana is that she was a young Chris
tian Roman girl who firmly and heroically
bore witness to Christ with the last drop ot her
blood, with the last breath f-he drew. Of her
fnuilv, her station, her career, why she was
chosen for the honor, the glory of dying for
our Lord, we do not know. All we are in
formed of is tbat she put her duty above all
else; that torture and death had no terrors for
her as a Christian, and that she died a worthy
daughter of the holy ohurch.
Some years ago in the catacombs of Rome
her body was found and was brougnt across
the sea, to a land of which the .wisest men
of her time knew nothing, and her altar was
raised here where her relics vow repose. To
day thousands cherish her life, her example,
her qualities in their minds, and here we see a
multitude of another mcc gathered to cele
brate tne heroic memory of ihe lovely Chris
tian girl who suffered all in the strength of
her piety for her religion. She stands to-day
before us great and glorious, for she repre
sents the idea of duty accomplished, of duty
done even through sore suffering and unto
death.
Father Yorke pictured the failings of the
present day and generation, and con
tinued:
A great battle is now being waged between
truth and calumny â a contest between right
and wrong. The ideas of modern progression
are often antagonistic to and against God and
his Gospel. Let us not deceive ourselves by
imagining that the life of a modern Christian
is less exacting than in the days of the mar
tyrs. We have, it is true, outgrown the ax,
fagot and stake, but the duties and vigils of a
Christian life require all the care, attention
and rectitude of the earlier times. We should
array ourselves against the influences of pride
and vanity â common and besetting sinsâ the
lusts of the flesh and the snares lurking in the
pomp and praise of the world.
Men are often led away from the paths of
Christian rectitude by the allurements of a
political life. The environments of politics
often blind well-intentioned citizens to their
real duties in this life. With these things for
gotten or ignored society loses much of what
such an individual may be capable of doing In
the line of duty to the Christian life. It may
be, alas, the love of the mighty dollar which
has lured the man away from a career that is
truly Christian. This is a common and de
plorable fact. It is well to remember that the
requirements of a religious life are unchange
able. Nothing that society may do or progress
suggest can abate a single duty we owe to re
ligion. The law remains, those who obey shall
be saved ; those who are in violation of it shall
be lost.
Catholics, tarnished with Mammon wor
ship, forget the honor due their holy mother
church. Can it be true that men are so erov
cling as to deny the church into which they
were baptized? There has been no society so
grand as the Catholic church from the flays of
the martyrs' down to the present. In past
ages princes, kings and others in high author
ity have tried to put her down, but could not
even soil her spotless robe. Why, then, should
you shirk your duty or be ashamed of that
mother whose faithful, dutiful children you
should be only too glad to acknowledge your
selves? Her record is a glorious, a splendid :
one. It is fitting, therefore, that on an occa
sion like this our thoughts should be turned
to the church our forefathers established cen
tuiles and centuries ago. Â»
All honor to those zealous pioneers who
paved the way tor what, we now enjoy â the
blessed fruit of a religions life! When the
history of those early times shall be adequately
written by competent hands then the meed of
praise which is justly the due of these exalted
and pious men shall be accorded them.
lint the time has come for a new order of
things; for those who speak the English lan
guage to take control of the great interest of
this diocese. A now commonwealth has
I grown up with a new population. These are
| the changes of the times which must be rec-
I ognized.
To-day a new bishop takes his place among
you. By the will of the holy father he is to
take charge of this great work. It Is his privi
lege to take possession of the foundation which
has been laid so broad and deep by his prede
cessors. He has now come to build the super
structure. Him we know and greatly admire.
His coming to you is our loss. We know of his
zeal, his ability and his untiring devotion to
the welfare of his people.
We almost prudgo him to you. I ask you to
strengthen his hands. His priests are about
him to sustain and help him; set your hearts
to the self same task.
His is no easy work. He has a great warfare
ahead of him. Let him realize in his very soul
that every onÂ» of you are loyal to him and to
the church.' Let him feel that you are a friend
of your Bishop, of his church, and then there
I are no heights to which you may not attain
I under his leadership. Finally let him under
| stand that you are always with him in every
! good act and word, and that he need only.to
L stretch forth his bands to accomplish his great
work.

CITIZEN SOLDIERS
OF THE STATE.
The long-expected conference of leading
officers of the National Guard took place
last Tuesday. ' Governor Budd, com
mander-in-chief, Adjutant-General A. "W.
Barrett and Major-Ueneral N. T. James
discussed guard affairs.
Obviously the result of the council of
war was the promulgation of the following
order: ... â¢ . . ;^.: ;
General Headquarters, I
__ , , Sacramento, Sept. 2, 1896. j-
Special order No. 13. â¢
â¢ [EXTRACT.]
In accordance with the provisions of section
1023, Political Code (amendments 1895).
Colonel D. B. Fairbanks, Fifth Infantry, N. Q. C,
Colonel J, J.Nunan, Sixth Infantry, N. Q. C,
and Lieutenant-Colonel J. C. Currier, Division
Staff, N. Q. c, are â¢ hereby appointed a
board of officers for. the purpose of considering
and recommending to the comtaander-in
chief what In their Judgment is most urgently
required for the uniforming and equipping of
the National Guard of California. â .-.:- v :>
By order commander-in-chief. .
A. W. Babbitt, Adjutant-General.
Colonel Fairbanks, chairman, will prob
ably convene the board in San Francisco
and hold sessions to ascertain in what re
spect the guard is most deficient. There
is common talk among officers and en
listed men that many of the Springfield
rifles, pattern of 1873, are defective and
unserviceable. -
Colonel. Currier, the division adjutant,
understands that Benicia arsenal contains
several thousand Springfield rifles or a
later pattern than that of 1873. Since the
Government ia arming the infantry regi
ments of the regular army with the Krag
Jorgensen rifles, many serviceable Spring
fields should be now available for National
Guard use.
Adjutant-General Barrett has Just ob
tained for the guard a sufficient number
of haversacks, canteens and meat ration
cans to equip 8000 men.
There yet remains to be filled in the di
vision staff the positions of engineer and
inspector of rifle practice. The mild sug
gestion that a little recruiting bad been
done on General WarfieJd's staff is re
sented.
First Brigade.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. The Sec
ond-street Armory, which is the home of !
Company B, Seventh Regiment, is re
splendent after an overhauling at a cost
of several hundred dollars.
The armory in Its new state was dedi
cated last week by a hop, which was at
tended by the fairest girls in the city.
The boys made a splendid showing. The
music was superb, the moonlight charm
ing and the social features of the pride of
Californiaâ her volunteer militiaâ were
made very prominent and enjoyable.
â¢ The regular monthly inspection and
drill took place the same night, followed
by a competitive drill for the recruit
medal. Roy Arnold won it easily. He is
a promising soldier and one of the best
drilled men in the State.
One of the sensations of the evening
was the unexpected return of ex-Private
Charles Overshiner, who left the company
to go to Honolulu over a year ago. Dur
ing his absence he was In the Hawaiian
army and got a taste of real war during
the seditions resulting in the arrest of a
number of treasonable characters.
A large proportion of the members of
Company B are Native Sons, and they are
accordingly preparing to make a fine show
ing at the festivities here on Admission
day, when the Native Sons will give a
grand parade, wheeling races, regatta,
masked carnival, etc.
A new brass band has been organized
among the members of Company B, and
it has already won praise for Its excellent
music. | The organization starts out well
and promises to become a valuable addi
tion to the musical resources of the city.
The director is Thomas Bates and the
leader is R. C. Byers, both of whom play
the cornet. The other members are: Roy
Arnold, , Al Woodruff, cornets; Harry
Johnson, R. A. Byers, altos; Ernest Jen
kins, A. "Wright, A. Relnert, Chauncey
Morton, W. W. Collier, tenors; Joe Mad
dox, A. M. Thornburg, barytones; C. E.
Case, tuba; John Shaw, bass drum; Will
Mac Donald, snare.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Sept. 3.â The
membership of Company X, infantry, is
gradually climbing upward toward the
seventy-five mark that the captain has
set his heart, on enrolling before 1896
passes out on the wings of time. Almost
every Monday evening one or two new
recruits are mustered into the service of
the State, and the majority of the men are
6- foot era. As soon as the new recruits are
placed in the ranks the shortest man in
the first set of fours will be 6 feet 1 inch.
Sergeant BodKin and Corporal Doyle
are once more on deck after their summer
among the pines.
Private D. I. Fabun returned from a
trip to the northern part of the State on
Saturday last. Sergeant Carter and a
number of the members who are athleti
cally inclined are making preparations for
a series of entertainments to raise funds
to equip the drill hall with a first-class set
of athletic apparatus. A political high
jinks will probably be the first entertain
ment given for that purpose, and will con
sist of a series of living pictures taken
from the cartoons of the comic papers and
a joint debate (burlesque) between a "gold
ug" a nd a "silver flea."
The regular monthly inspection of the
company will take place on Monday even
ing, September 17. '
Major J. W. F. Diss, brigade inspector,
is at home again after his summer outing
among the National Guard camp and the
Knights of Pythias at Redondo and Santa
Monica.
Major F. C. 'Prescott of Redlands is a
frequent visitor here. The major is look
ing after his political fences at present,
but he always finds time to say a good
word for the guard, of which he is an hon
ored and efficient member.
Lieutenant Higby, battalion adjutant,
paid the armory a short visit last Monday
evening. The lieutenant is one of the old
members of the company and the boys al
ways extend the glad hand whenever his
face appears in the drill hall or assembly
rooms. â â¢ .
. Private Rollins of Highlands has never
missed a drill since he enlisted, although
it means a twelve-mile ride every Monday
night. Such faithfulness to duty should
be an object lesson to the city chaps who
have only one or two blocks to walk and
then manage to miss about two drills out
of a month. _^ . "
Second Brigade.
The Second Brigade Signal Corps, un
der command of Captain G. C. Board
man, will leave the City Tuesday evening
next by the 6 o'clock boat for a dismount
ed bivouac at Larkspur. The men will be

outfits will be taken along also, as it is
tbe intention to engage in signal practice
on the 9th. About thirty members expect
to attend. The return will be made on
the afternoon of the 9th.
As it is necessary that a field officer be
present Major Evans, signal officer of the
Second Brigade, will accompany the
corps. Captain Wallord, former instructor
of telegraphy in the corps, will also at
tend. The Signal Corps is now in a mo3t
flourishing condition, being recruited to
its full strength, with constant applica
tions for membership.
Third Brigade.
MERCED, Cal., Sept. 3.â Company H,
Sixth Infantry, attended divine services
last Sunday evening at the Bethel M. E.
Church South. The company turned out
strong, and were well received at the
church. The Rev. D. M. Edwards, for
merly a National Guardsman in the East,
welcomed the boys, and spoke upon the
subject: "The Captain of Our Salvation."
At the regular drill meeting last Mon
day night two new members were received,
and six applications read the first time.
Other applications are expected this week.
The company now numbers nfty-nve men
and recruits ara coming in quite rapidly.
It is the intention of the commander to
drop out all inefficient members as rapidly
as new enlistments will permit.
Captain Graham and First Lieutenant
Smith are away for a week, and in the
meantime the company Is in the charge i
of Second Lieutenant Bambauer.
WOODLAND, Cal., Sept. S.â On last
Wednesday evening Company F, Second
Infantry, were paid an official visit from
Captain Carrington, TJ. S. A. He came
unannounced and his call was an un
lucky one for the local Guard.
Captain Carrington assumed command
for the balance of the evening and put the
men through some severe work. He
drilled them in close-column squad drill, !
skirmish drill, etc. The company executed !
all these maneuvers with such exact pre- j
ciiion that tuey were the recipients of
much praise and admiration from the
visiting official. He complimented Captain
Prindle very highly on the efficient man- I
ncr in which he had drilled his company.
He advised him to practice guard mount
and squad drilling by means of signals.
It is probable that Company F will j
select some good place and go in camp
the latter part of September.
Captain Prindle is trying to secure a
suitable 500-yard target for his men to
use, but so far has been unsuccessful
Quite a number of the boys are on their
best behavior, aa two sergeants and four
corporals are soon to be appointed.
Interest in target practice is not what it
should ba. Inquire of the members and
theyinvariablyjsay, "Wnat's the Ã¼bÂ«? I
fell down one or two points in the June
shoot, and if I should make a possible In
September it would not help me any
under the new rules."
The local guard boasts of some of the
best sharpshooters in the State. Lieuten
ant J. G. Lee, battalion adjutant, is an ex
pert with both the rifle and pistol. First
Lieutenant J. J. Ward, Sergeant Peart
and Private Edson are in the first class.
A good many are improving at every tar
get practice.
The officers of the company at present
ere: H. E. Prindle, captain; J. J. Ward,
first lieutenant; Wayne Utting, second
lieutenant; sergeantsâ Ed Ready, Jaret
Hevel, A. J. Mossmayer, G. C. Peart*

FROM JUSTICE
A Man Who Robbed a Room
in the Marechal
Niel.
AWOKE THE OCCUPANT.
There Was a Brief Struggle and
the Burglar Made His
Escape.
HOT PURSUIT AND CAPTURE.
The Stolen Property Found in His
Possession â Was Booked for
Grand Larceny.
The guests in the Marechal Niel Hotel,
on Ellis and Jones streets, were awasenod
from their slumbers about 6 o'clock yester
day morning by a terrific noise on the
stairs, and for some minutes consternation
reigned supreme.
The noise was made by J. F. Mail, one
of the guests, wiio was chasing a burglar,
and bosh rushed down the stairways from
the third floor at a rattling gait, and ihen
out onto the street.
Mail, who is stock clerk in the San Fran
cisco Shoe House, occupies room 49 on
the third floor. He got home early yester
day morning, and after taking off hit hat
and coat, lay down on the bed to read for
a short time before retiring, but he soon
fell asleep.
He had not taken the precaution to lock
his door, and was awakened by some one
going through his veat pockets. He jumped
out of bed and seeing a man in front of
him, he made a pass at him with his right
hand, but missed Dim. The man backed
into a corner, and Mail mace a kick at
him but asain mis%ed him. They had a
tussle, and the burelar got to the door and
rushed along the hallway and down the
stairs pursued by Mail, who was snouting
"Stop thief !"
The burglar kept ahead of Mail and
when he got to tbe street he ran north to
O' Farrell street and turned west toward
Leavenworth. Mail kept close behind
him, shouting for help, ana J. G. Welsh,
a hackuriver, who was walking alone
O'Farrell street, heard his cries, and tak
ing in the situation, he grabbed hold of
the burglar. There was a brief struggle
and before Mail reached them the burglar
broke away.
A milk wagon nappened to pass jast
then and Mail and Welsh pressed the
driver into service. They started off after
the burglar, who turned down Leaven
worth street, but Mail and Welsh kept
ahead of tbe milk wagon and overtook the
burglar at Eliis street.
Mail found that the burglar had tsken
his gold watch, chain and charm and
$48 45 in coin. The burglar delivered up
the watch and coin but denied tbat he
had tne chain and charm, savins he must
have dropped them. Mail and Welsh
marched him back over the route taken,
looking for the chain and charm, but did
not find them tiil they got back to the
hotel, where they were found in the hall
way.
The burglar begged Mail to let him go
for the sake of his wife and family and
told him if he had been a bad man he
could have shot him with the revolver
which be saw on top of the bureau. Mail
was not in a forgiving mood an' i made him
Bit on a trunk in the hallway till Police
man George Collins was notified and he
placed the burglar under arrest. The man
was taken to tne City Prison and charged
with grand larceny. He gave ihe name of
Henry }!eyer, 23 years of age and his oc
cupation as a waiter. He had in a purse
$20 75 that De.onged to himself and a
nickel watch and two keys.
All the detective^ had a look at Meyer In
the prison, but none of them recoenized
him. His wife called to see him, but was
uncommunicative.
Meyer hao walked into the hotel as the
proprietor, according to custom, had
turned out the hall lights at 5 o'clock, and
opened the front door. He had evidently
tried several bedroom doors, but found
them all locked till he reached Mail's on
the third floor.
Two or three weeks ago the room of an
other guest at the hotel v.as entered dur
ing the night and his gold watch and
chain were stolen. The police think that
Meyer was tbe thief and that be may have
been implicated in the recent burglaries in
several hotels.
Detectives Silvey and Reynolds found
the room occupied by Meyers, and to their
great surprise and satisfaction made a dis
cover? that was not anticipated. Meyers
bad a stock of jewelry, fancy articles and
clothing in such large quantities that a
second-hand store might be opened with
the stuff in his room. The detectives
packed the jewels and smal. things into a
valise and bundled ur> the clothing, sticks
and umbrei'as and took them all to Cap
tain Lees' office.
Among the jewelry were found a fine
gold wafch and an opal pin belonging to
Charles O'Byrne, 405 Montgomery street,
stolen some months ago. A beautiiui
crazy-quilt, the property of Colonel J. G.
C. Lee, United States Quartermaster, was
among the recovered articles.
Tne other things iound in the room are
a- follows: A handsome silk plush cape
trimmed with tarand passementerie.a gold
necklace of balls one-fourth inch in
diameter, a gold thimble .with the name
Kittie W. Terry entraved on the rim, a
horseshoe diamond scarfpin containing
thirteen diamonds, a scarlpin witn an
emerald surrounded by diamonds, a large

like a star, with a cluster of diamonds ana
five small emeralds and five diamonds

The Oldest Woman Suffragist in San Francisco.
"I hope to live long enough to cast my first vote."
So says Mrs. Emily Morrell Wood, mother of Mrs. John F. Swift. The venerable
old lady was born in Johnstown, New York, more than eighty-six years ago, and
came to this coast in 1850. Years seem only to have brought her added dignity
and grace, while her mental powers, like wine, seem to have improved with age.
"I suppose," she said yesterday, "I am the oldest woman suffragist in this City,
and lam proud to say that my dear husband, who left me years ago for a better
world, was of the same mind. He came to California a year before I did, on the Pal
metto, a bark of which he was part owner. His health was delicate, and this climate
agreed with him so well that after a year he went back to the States and fetched me
to what was then a wild country. I love this State and I shall love it more when
woman shall enjoy political equality with man, as she surely will."
Mrs. Wood was a schoolmate with Eiizabe h Cady Stanton, her father and Judge
Cady. the father of Mrs. Stanton, being Justices on the same bench. Some yearÂ» ago
Mrs. Wood, who is a great reader, was visited by a severe affliction, becoming abso
lutely blind from cataract. In this sad state she remained for over four years, when
a successful operation restored her sight. The old lady is an ardent admirer of Tin
Call and reads its woman suffrage news daily. She is also a fine needlewoman and !
many a poor family wears garments made by her deft fineers. Her late husband was â 
partner of John Lorimer Graham, the famous New York barrister, before coming to I
this State. Mr?. Wood is also one of the Anneke Jans heirs, her great-grandfather
having married Ractiel, the granddaughter of Anneke Jans. Her memory of events
long past is most vivid, and the woman suffragists may well be proud of their veteran
partisan.
RIFLE RANGES

The San Francisco Schuet

Mound.
BULLETS IN THE BLACK.
The Thirty-Eighth Annual
Festival Attracts Large
Numbers.
THE PEIZES ARE PLENTIFUL
Naval Battalion and Independent
Rifles Hold Their Monthly
Medal Shoots.
The thirty-eighth annual festival of the
San Francisco Scbuetzen Verein was cele
brated at Shell Mound park yesterday, the
piece de rebistance of an interesting and
varied programme of attractions being the
competition shoot for members of the or
ganization. For this and the bowling,
which almost rivaled it in popular esti
mation, no less a sum than $500 in cash
had been specially provided â a circum
stance tending to promote much more
than the normal excitement invariably a
feature of all such competitions.
The attendance of outsiders was consid
erable, though the members of the
Schuetzen VÂ«rein, reeplendent in refur
bished uni orms, were necessarily con-
I spicuous among the throng, and those
whose attention was not altogether ab
sorbed by the shooting and the bowling |
found time to devote to the gentler pas
times of dancing and lovemakingâ for it
goes without saying thac pretty frauleins
were there in plenty.
A festival of any kind, with which a son
of the Fatherland is concerned, would
j greatly belie tradition if music were lack-
I ing. On this occasion Ritzau's brass band
charmed the listeners with the "concord
of sweet sounds" and discoursed classi
cally and otherwise most indefatigabiy
from morn till dewy eve. The interior of
the park pavilion was appropriately dec
orated with banners and bunting, the j
stars and stripes and tbe flag of the I
Schuetzen Verein being most frequently
displayed among the former. A gaylv
colored inscription below tbe bamistand
extended a laconic, hot none the less cor
dial, â¢Wilikommen" to one and all.
Throughout the day, which was one of
the thirsty variety, lager oeei and milder
potations for those opposed to alcoholic I
stimulants, were liberally on tap and as- j
similated in large quantitiesâ by the
smoke-begrimed riflemen in particular.
The shooting began at 10 a. m. and was
continued until 6 o'clock, with an inter
mission at noon for luncn. Tbe pro
gramme included shooting at company
targets, most points and best centers. The
final result of the two last-named competi
tions will not be known until this evening,
inasmuch as the process of determining
the same involved a difficult calculation
by machinery, which measures shots to
the thousandth parr of an inch. The
whole of the prizes, for both the shooting
and ihe bowling, will be distributed on
Thursday eveninc next at the California
Ball, Bush streftt.
Tue result of the shooting at company
targets, fifteen men participating, was as

WANT FAIR ASSESSMENT.
Why Should $30,000,000 Be Added
to the Roil of San Fran
cisco?
It Wou'd Double Rents, Depress Busi.
ness and M.ke Men Leave
the City.
The impression prevails that it is the
intention of the State Board of Equal
ization during the present week to add
I $30,000,000 lo the assessment roll of the
City and County of San Francisco. Prop
erty-owners and tenants are in conse
quence more or less alarnccd, and there
exists among them a general feeling of
ar.eas ness. One of them said yesterday:
"About one-ti ird of the entire State tax
is now paid by Pan Francisco, and interior
counties, in their eagerness to see her
assessment increased, seem to forget that
they will be called upon to sustain a raise
in the following year.
"Last year the assessment of this City
j and County, was increased, despite the
protest of ihe Board of Supervisors, $30,
-000.000, and considering the business de
pression which has prevaiied since then, a
jikp increase now would be equivalent to
$60,000,000. The exisiing standard of
values is very high and equitably there
should be a reduction rather than an in
crease of $30,000,000 in the assessment roll.
"If the increase be made it will, in the
! opinion of competent judges, compel land
lords to double the rents of their tenants,
who will then probably be induced to go
into business in Oakland or some other
neighboring city or town. Then the land
lords will not care to make any further in
vestments and the results will be a general
business stagnation."
"The State Board of Equalization," said
Alfred D. Miesegaes last night, "has in its
mind a standard of full cash value of prop
erty, but just what that is nobody seems
to know. All counties, however, must
conform to it. What is your assessment
in proportion to the true valuation of
property in your county? This is the
question aslced by the Equalizers.
"From their decision an Appeal has
never yet been taken in this State. Ap
peals, though, have benn taken in other
States and can be in this, but as to the
precise method to be pursued I Â«m not
advised. Property-owners, however, have
an undoubted rieht to petition the
Supreme Court to review the action of the
State Board of Equalization if they think
they have been treated unjustly."
A. Cbesebrough, one of the Equalization
Board, left last night for Sacramento.

dux (D.).
The friends of Warren B. English,
headed by Frank J. Moffltt, after a hard
fight succeeded last night in securing his
nomination as the fusion candidate.
The committee, having failed in its ef
forts at fusion, expended its remaining
strength in finding a soft place on which
to fall, so that tbe dullness of the thud
might not jar too severely upon the ear of
the public.
Finding that they could not agree they
fixfd up matters so that Messrs. Patton
and Vann withdrew and left tbe field open
for English and Barlow, who were chosen
as tbe fusion candidates.
Only one district, the Fifth, was left.
The conference called Mr. Rogers into the
secret shrine and delicately informed him
that the Democratic members' of the com
mittee were afraid that he would not receive
the votes of citizens of the district who did
not believe in A. P. Aism., and that for
that reason he would not be as available a
candidate as was desired.
A. B. Kinne, a Populist member of tbe
committee and of the People's Party State
Cen'ral Committee, was proposed, and
Mr. Rogers withdrew in his favor.
James H. Bar--y was proposed in Rogers'
place by the Democrat who appeared to
be running Ihe whole shnw, bui the Popu
lists objected to him on the ground that
he bad uttered his thoughts concerning
some of their leaders.
The ;Third and Sixth districts were
voted lor together and the joint vote
showed a majority for English. Then a
separate vole was taken and English was
cho-en, one authority says unanimously,
and the other that Leggett voted against
him.
In the separate vote on the Sixth Bar
low >eceived twelve and Patton three
votes, the three being Uemp-ey. Hassett
and Letpett. Vann withdrew in order to
help Barlow, whom the Populists wanted.
It is reported that in a few days Castie
will be prevailed upon to withdraw in
favor of Maddox. That will give the
Democrats five candidates and the Popu
lists only two and those two in the hope
less districts.
The joint conference committee will
meet at 1 o'clock this afternoon to sign
the report to be made by Law. or, Gesford
and Londsborough.
The report will be submitted to the State
Central Committees of these parties for
approval or rejection.
The conference did not adjourn until
midnight
ENGLISH AND BARLOW.
Los Ansreler.es Determined to Have
Whst They Ask.
Thk Call was the only paper in San
Francisco yesterday that gave the true
inwardness of the tight in the Fusion
Conference Committee last Saturday
night.
The assault upon Warren B. English,
Democratic candidate for Congress from
the Third District, by a Democratic fac
tion headed by Daggett, Tarpey, Foote,
McNab, Gould and Budd, was the general
subject of conversation among politicians
yesterday- Interwoven with the little
faction fight is the, reminiscence that Mr.
English while in Congress, voted against
the railroad funding bill, and that be
thereby incurred the hostility of the
Southern Pacific Company.
Thus far that corporation has won every
fight it has made in the fusion commit
tee. It has succeeded in preventing its
enemy, George W. Monteitb, from being
selected as the lueion candidate from the
Pirst District; it has been equally for-
I tunate in the turning down of McGiashan
I from the Second; and on Saturday night
1 it succee ed in causing a deadlock in the
| committee, which had the effect of pre-
I ventui^.', at least for that session, tbe i-e-
I lection of Mr. English as the fusion can
[ didate in that district.
Judge Maeuire was spared for reasons
j which have not yet been brought to Hgi.t.
j Tne Judge Jtands so high with his party
: tbat to have turned him down would
I have brought about a reaction that would
nave been very damaging to the railroad
I company during the present campaign,
and might have awakened an issue whicn
the Populists have discarded for that of
free coinage â namely, the railroad ques
tion, which the company is always willing
to let steep.
J. Taylor Rogers. Populist candidate
from the Fifth District, is Mayor Sutro's
clerk and he is not liked by the Southern
Pacific for that reason, added to the fur
ther one that as a Pojmlist he would be
obliged to make a right against the fund
ing bill. Hence, it surprised no one when
the fact came to licht tbat the committee
would turn him down for some one else,
even if that some oi.e else should be a
Populist.
Yesterday it was reported tbat Rogers'
friends put up a fight for him. He could
be saved if the Populists, or four of the
six in i he committee, would vote lor Pat
ton (Democrat) in the Sixth.
This would leave two Populists on the
ticket, and necessarily the vacant place,
that in the Third District, would have to
be filled with Populist Vann, Rogers being
used as the club to knock out both Eng
lish and Barlow and to knock in Patton.
and thereby please tbe Los Angeles peo
ple and tbe Southern Pacific Company as
well. South of the Tebachapi there is a
large and influential population, and they
demand that the candidate should come
Irom Los Angeles. They say that Mr.
BarJow iives in San Luis Obispo. and that
when he wants to go to Los Angeles, all
the way by rail, he must first come to San
Francisco "and lake ihe train from this
place for tbe citrus land. The Los An
geles people are an energetic crowd, and
they usually obtain what they ask in poli
tics. When they don't get it tbe welkin
shrieks for several consecutive months
thereafter.

Mrs. Chapman-Catt, the Famous Woman-Suffrage Orator.
Last night's overland train broueht to town a little lady who has earned the title
of the "Wonian-suffruge Gatiing-gun" by reason of her splendid achievements in the
battles which the women of the United States are waging for equal political rights.
"Three years and more l:ave passed," she said last night, "since I was last in San
Francisco, and I have missed the pace ever since. Perhaps some may disagree with
me, while other#may think I am 'giving taffy,' but to my mind San Francisco is the
oniy city worth living in. I have heard great tbines of the woman suffrage work here,
and can hardly express my delight at the noble, whole-hearted fashion in which Thk
Call has espoused our cause.
"I hope to do my share in the work of winning (he ballot for Californian women,
thoueh it looka as though the labor would be a lu-ht one, since tha best men in the
State seem to be on our side. In Idaho I think our triumph is assured. All the
political parties have suffrage pranks in their platform?, and the prevailing sentiment
is in favor of the movement. I hope for equal success in our endeavors nere in Cali
fornia."
At Port Costa a delegation headed by Miss Mary G. Hay, chairman of the Woman
Suffrage State Central Committee, boarded the train to welcome the Hew'.y arrived
apostle of political equality, and at the Sixteenth-street station in Oakland another
party, chaperoned by Mesdames Emma B. Sweet and Nellie Holbrook-Blinn, added
their quota to ti>e nuard of honor.
Mrs. Chapnian-Catt, despite her youth, is a woman of singularly commanding
presence, and at the same time most winnin - and attractive in her manner. She will
doubtless do splendid work in the great cause to which she has devoted her talents.
pany has cained whatever it wanted from
the comm ttÂ«*e does not necessarily imply
that a majority of the conference commit
tee are its Dond thralls or even its friends,
but events have no shaped themselves or
have been s aped by o hers outside of the
committee tha the ccrporadon bus been

Pacific disposes.
QUEER RULES.
Two Men Could Defeat the Will of
Thirteen.
Tbe plan of action under which the
Fusion Conference Committee of Fifteen
was organized was peculiarly drawn, so
that two of the three silverites absolutely
controlled the entire conference. No man
could be nominated without their consent.
The plan provided that in order to seiect
a fusion candidate the votes of two-thirds
of each or anization would be necessary;
that is, four of the six Democrats, four of
tbe six Populists and iwo of tne three
silver men, making a total vote of ten.
Should a link in the chain be missing,
should a candidate rec ive the votes of six
Democrats, six Populis's and one s lyer
man, making thirteen oui of the hfieon
votes, he wouKi noi be chosen.
It wa3 no doubt with an eye to the
future that this plan was formulated, and
there is no doubt also that the authors of
it. who arranged things so that ten votes
would elect a man and thirteen votes
would defeat him (probably because thir
teen is an unlucky number), hml the
English and other contingencies in their
mind's eye, and prepared themselves to
meet it.

The Christian Endeavorers of Westmin

evening in place of tne regular service.
M.my Christian Endeavorers from other
churches were present.
J. S. Webster, vice-chairman of the *97
convention committee, presided. The
meeting was opened wich a brief praise
service, followed by Scrip: ural reading and
prayer by Harry Vanderlip. A. S. Jonn
son spoke on "Missionary Worlc in Our
Christian Endeavor Societies." Donald
Mackenzie addres*ed the Endeavorers on
"Spiritual Results of the Convention at
Washington." "Two hundred ana thirty
one thousand young people joined the
church last year through the efforts of the
Chrisiian Endeavor societies," said Mr.
Mackenzie. "Who will say, then, in the
face of these h^ures that the End-avor
conventions and bocieties are not produc
tive of preat grod?"
Koila V. Watt, chairman of the '97 com
mittee, who uas just returned to this City,
took for vis subject "Washington Briefs."
"Tne people at Washington were deeply
impressed with the convention." !<aid Mr.
Watt, "and they could not help being im
pressed, for everywhere they went they
saw the badges of the En<leavorers. Fully
27.000 crowded the great meeting-places.' 1

FOR PRESIDENT
WILLIAM McKINLEY, or Ohio
FOB VICF-PREBIDEXTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ELECTION' NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
One advantage of Democratic fusion
to the Populists is that it will cut their
â¢wisdom teetb for tbem.
For Republicans of California the watcb
words of the next two months are "har
monize, orcanize and educate."
Democracy may gain something by
fusion with Populists, but whatever the
Democrats gain will be lost to the Popu
lists.
Democrats may mock at tha phrase
"honest money," but the people will do
their mocking at the platform of dislionest
money.
To put money into circulation is the
need of the time, and that can be done
only by a protective tariff that will revive
industry.
"Free silver comape without the con
sent of othernations" isa catching phrase,
but it does not catch anybody who under
stands business
Bryan talks so much sentiment and so
little business that even the leaders of his
own party are beginning to believe he has
no business to talk.
If Bryan doesn't look out he will make
himself so common in the campaign that
he won't be able to make a living as a lec
turer after it is over.
In the day 3of protection and reciproc
ity there were good times in tbis country,
and those tines will come again when
McKinley is elected.
This may be called a campaign of educa
tion, but it begins to look more like a gen
eral preparation for a erand Republican
ratification meeting in November.
"I'll take the turkey and you may have
the crow," says the Democrat to the Popu- i
list, or "you may have the crow and I'll
take the turkey, and now let us fuse."
Even as a speech-maker Bryan is not
measuring up knee high to McKinlev, as
can be seen by reading the speeches the
two men have made since the campaign '
opened.
It would be a matter of passing interest
to know what has become of that scheme
to raise a Popocrat campaign fund by
passing the hat around among the work
ingmen.
The worirer* in the woolen mil's of this
country received $86,000,000 In v.-azes in
1892 and only about $40,000,000 in 1895, and
that is what the Gorman tariff did for that
industry.
Neither free silver nor any other cheap
money device can bring prosperity to a
Nation burdened with a tariff which
operates adversely to the interests of its
own people.
,
According to Sam Jones the attempt of
the Democrats to run a campaign in com
bination with the Populists is like that of
a man trying to climb a ladder with an
armful of eels.
Republican reciprocity treaties opened
profitable markets for the products of
American farms, but these treaties were
abrogated by Democrats, who are now
trying to catch votes by posing as the
friends of the farmer.
The trouble with the country is thnt we
import too much from abroad that ought
to be made at homo, and, while the manu
facturers of Europe receive our money,
our own workingmen are without wages'
and our home markets without cus
tomers.
Silver monometallism would cure none
of the evils of the time, but protection, by
reviving industry and putting money into
circulation, would promote prosperity and
strengthen the Government in the effort
to bring about the free coinage of silver
by international agreement.
By international agreement the Repub
lican party will provide for the free coin
ace of silver under conditions that will
make tbe silver dollar good all round the
world, while the Democratic scheme would
reduce the value of the dollar, would lower
the purchasine power of wage? and would
hardly be of benefit even to the silver
miners.
According to Edward Atkinson, the
free-trade expert, the farmers who in 1892
received over $900,000,000 for their corn,
wheat and oats got only a little over
$.531,000,000 for the same .crops in 1895.
The lesson was costly, and there ought to
be no need fora repetition of it. To many
a workingman this is not so much a par
tisan campaign as a campaign for bread
and butler, and on election day not a few
Democrats will be found voting for Mc-
Kinley and good wages.
BRYAN IS A FREE-TEADER.
Bryan Is a Free-Trader-When
a member of Congress W. J. Bryan
took advantage of every occasion to advo
cate free trade. In March, 1892, and in
January, 1894, he was particularly ve
hement in his denunciation of the policy
of protection to American industries.
Speaking of the principle of protection
Mr. Bryan said: "Now, what is a pro
tective tariff and what does it mean? It
is a simple device by which one man i*
authorized to collect money from his
fellow-men. â¢ â¢ * We welcome to
this country every industry that can
stand upon its feet; but we do not wel
come the industries that come to ride
upon our backs. * * * I want to state,
as emphatically as words can state,
that I consider it as false in economy and
vicious in policy to attempt to raise at a
higii price in this country that which we
can purchase abroad at a low price in ex
change for the products of our toil."
Bryan Is a l'rcc-Trader-Con
earning protection to wool - growers
and wool#n factories Mr. Bryan said:
"Speaking for myself it is immaterial in
my judgment whether the sheep-grower
receives any benefit from the tariff or not.
Whether he does or does not, whether the
wool manufacturer collects a compen
satory duty from the consumer of woolen
goods ana pays it over to the wool-grower,
or collects it and keeps it himself, or
doesn't collect it at all, and therefore does
not need it, I am for free wool."
liryanls a Free-Trader- When
the question of giving proper encour
agement in the shape of a bounty to
American growers of sugar-beets and
sugar-cane was under discussion Mr.
Bryan said: "Some have advocated
the immediate repeal of the bounty and
the imposition of a tariff on supar. Others
have favored the repeal of the bounty
without a duty on sugar. The difference
between a vrotective tariff and a bounty is
simply a difference of form. In the one
case it is open and visible, and in the
other it is secret and hiddeji. There is a
difference between a bounty and a pro
tective tariff that the Bible describes
when it speaks of the 'Destruction that
wasteth at noonday, and the pestilence
that walketh in darkness.' It is the dif
ference between the man who meets you
upon tho highway, knocks you down and
takes what you have, and the man who
steals into your house in the night while
you are asleep and robs you of your treas
ures; and if I had to make choice between
the two I should consider the highway
robber the more honorable, because he
does what he does openiy and before the
world. It is as easy to justify a bounty as
a protective tariff, and it is impossible to
justify either." Bryan is a free-trader.
The free coinage of silver means the single
standard of silver. It means a cheaper dol
lar vith less purchasing power. It means a
reduction in the wages of labor; not in the
number of dollars, but in the quantity of
bread, meat, clothes, comforts he can pur
chase with his daily wages. It means a repu
diation of a portion of all debts, public and
private. It means a bounty to all the banks,
savings institutions and trust companies that
are in debt more than their credits. It means
a nominal advance in prices of the produce
of the farmer, but a decrease in the pur
chasing power of his money. Its chief attrac
tion is that it enables a debtor to pay his
debts contracted upon the existing standard
with money of lens value. â Se7iator tSherman.
AT McKINLEY'S HOME.
Five thousand Pennsylvania voters paid
their respects in person to Major McKin
ley at his home last Saturday, and in the
course of his speech to them he said : "It is
this year, my countrymen, a great cause
for which we contend, commanding the
support of every patriot, for it represents
the National honor and stands for Na
tional prosperity. It involves every
cherished interest of the country and em
braces the welfare of every citizen of the
Republic. It involves the labor and
wages of the people and the earnings ac
cumulated and to be accumulated; the
honor of the country, its rinancial integ
rity, its good name, all are at stake in this
great contest; and every lover of country
must be arousea to duty and quickened to
responsibility in this crisis."
The cause for which the patriotism of
the country is contending this year i 3, as
Major McKinley says, for the Nation's
bonor and National prosperity. There is
no doubt about the gravity ot the situa
tion. The classes that are following
Bryan are stimulated by nope of the
spoils of ofiice, which he has promised as
the price of their labor for him. Others
are espousing his cause because they bate
law and order, and Bryan's attack upon
the Federal judiciary gives them assur
ance that he will make thintrs very easy
for them if he is elected, and still others
are following him because they look for
ward to a general unsettling of trade, com
merce and finance if he shall be elected,
because they hope to proht by the mix
fortunes a Bryan victory would send" over
the country lite a destroying whirlwind.
The cause which Major McKinley stands
for certainly does mean the preservation
of the integrity of the Nation and the re
opening of the highways of industry and
prosperity, and it is comforting to see
men travel by the thousands to another
State to r.ssure the standard-bearer of
right, of law, of order and of prosperity
that they are ready for the fray ; and it is
still more comfortinir to see men who have
hitherto opposed the Republican party
putting aside al! party ties and personal
preference and rallying to the defense of
the principles oi our Government. But
there is reason why they should. Bryan's
managers, with Bryan's hearty approval,
are conducting a campaign which is in
tended, to stir up class hatred and sectional
animosity. Buch things outrht not to be
in this country, and it behooves every
patriot to resolve that such principles as
Bryan proclaims shall iiot prevail. The tics
wnich bind in one common brotherhood
in liberty under law should be stronger
toan tho ties of party in times like these.
Bryan tells our industries and our
Workings**!! that "It is a vicious policy to
attempt to raise at high prices in this
country that which we can purchase
abroad at low prices." If that is not
enough to stimulate wage-earners to a
hearty participation in the effort to pro
tect themselves from the "low- price"
labor of other countries they certainly
care very little whether they have employ
ment or not, and the same is true of our
industries. Major McKinley did not ex
aggerate at all when he tola his Pennsyl
vania visitors that "In this year, my coun
trymen, it is a great cause for which we
contend, commanding the support of
every patriot, for It represents the National
honor and stands lor National prosper
ity." Nor did he more than voice a great
truth when he said: '-Our glorious coun
try has suffered no dishonor in tho past;
it must suffer no dishonor in the future.
The past is secure and glorious. The pres
ent and future are our fields of duty and
opportunity. Those who have preceded
us have done weil their part. Shall we be
less honest and patriotic and brave in the
performance of our part ? In America we

portunity. In America, thank God. no
man is born to Dower. It has long been
determined that tne philosophy of Jeffer
son is true, and that this, the land of the
free and self-governed, is the strongest as
well as the best Government in the world."
I believe gold, silver and piper should'cir
culate at par, that neither should be driven
from circulation. If Bryan is elected and a
free-coinarje law is passed it will, as I see it,
drive gold from circulation, and we uill be on
a single silver basis. If McKmley is elected
silver will be retained in its place as part of
the money of the Natio7i, gold will not be
driven out and all kinds of money will be of
equal value and purchasing power in tlie
hands of the American people. Any way, I
am taking no chances, and will tote for Me-
Kinley. â Terence V. Pouderly.
THERE IS ROOM AT THE TOP.
In his speech at the Auditorium Satur
day night General Barnes uttered a great
truth when he said "there ought to be no
classes in this Nation, because there is
nothing in this country, either of wealth
or position, of power or energy, that is
not equally open to all." He might have
added tnat only the thoroughly dis
reputable demagogue ever charges that
the people of this country are divided into
classes and that the poor have no cnance
to rise above their environments. The
Bryans are talking a good deal about the
"common people" and the "working
class" to breed hatred among the people,
but every one knows, or should know,
that it is all for political capital.
The truth of the niatte r is, those whom
we cail very rich were once very poor.
There are a few families who are enjoying
wealth that was accumulated in genera
tions of the past, but for the most part the
wealthy men of this country started with
no capital except such as was deposited in
their brain, brawn and energy. It is a
mistake to suppose that opportunity to
accumulate wealth or secure political
preferment is a niatter of favoritism, and
those who preach any other doctrine are
the enemy of those who are striving by
honest effort to acquire a better footing in
the world.
The burden of the purpose of the Re
publican parcy has always been to
strengthen and extend the opportunity of
waee-earners to become proprietors them
selves, and how well it has succeeded is
shown in the ownership of nearly all our
great and small industries. It is the fact
that nearly all our mills and factories
made small beginnings and that they were
put in motion by wage-earners, who de
veloped them into great enterprises by
energy, frugality and business sense. This
is not a Nation of classes so far as oppor
tunity is concerned. Some, yes, very
many of the heads of the great business,
banging and railway enterprises of this
country, commenced as otneeboys. There
always is room at the top in the United
States.
Whin Major McKinhy was striving to up
hold an American policy which would place
our agricultural and manufacturing inter
ests beyond the power of foreigners to injure,
through competition, he did not ask the con
sent of any foreign country; he did not take
counsel from them; he considered what would
benefit the American wage-earner and his
employer. If American manufacturers were
benefited by the McKinley law, so were jlwor
ican workmen, so were American business
vien, and if the day comes when we, as Amer
icans, can go it alone on the money question,
rest assured Mr. McKinley will be as ready
and anxious to take that course as any other. â

On September 1 the Los Angeles Record cele
brated, in a large and creditable edition, its
first anniversary as the pioneer penny paper
of the Pacific Coast. '"It was predicted," says
the Record, "that the penny proposition would
not take iv Los Augeies because of the flight
circulation of pennies in this region, and be
cause of the alleged prejudice that prevails in
this State agaiuot pennies. The publishers,
however, realized that Los Angeles is essen
tially an Eastern city, as its population is in
the main composed of those who have within
six or seven years resided in the East, where
the penuy has been a current coin for thirty
yuars, and who therefore have no prejudice
which old residents of California are sup
posed to have inheritod from the mining days,
when the two-bit and four-bit pieces were the
smallest change. The publishers of the Record
believed that for this reason the common cir
culation of the penny could be brought about
more easily than anywhere else in California,
and the results have demonstrated that they
were correct."

duction or output of from 500 to 600 barrels

The Livermore Heraia advises every foothill
farmer in Alameda County to "go to prospect
ing" ; to bore, drill and dig about their farms;
to look for indications of cement, lime, pot
ter's clay, salt, buiidiug stone, glassblower's
sand, gas, oil, coal, manganese, cinnabar, gold
and silver. The reasons for such suggestions
are contained In an article of which the fol
lowing is a liberal extract:
'â¢On the southern slopes of the hills that
skirt the northern boundary of this county,
about five miles from Livermore, is the farm
of C. G. Munch. Upon this farm there is a 20
-acre patch covered with springs, more or less
mineral in their quality, and abundant in their
flow. Most of them are mildly flavored with
sulphur and iron and one or two of them are
quite briny. For years there has been running
to waste from these springs immense quanti
ties of the finest natural gas, and no one knew
it. Mr. Munch could now illuminate his house
and provide himself with all the fuel for Heat
ing anu cooking purposes by simply catching
the natural discharge of gas from these
springs. The people of this valley are in prac
tical and unmindful Ignorance of what is un
der their feet. Mr. Munch has simply con
[ tented himself to plod aloug iv the ggod. o ;d.
-fashioned way, plowing and seeding and har
vesting. He never thought that his ranch
could be good for anything else. But sur
rounded as his place is by surface indications
of coal, gas and oil, Mr. Munch may cultivate
the faith that there is untold wealth under his
plantation.
"Last week yonng Farmer Berry finished
building a perpendicular addition to the bot
tom of his well". When his auger hit a tongh
formation about sixty feet down he stopped,
and the water rose ten feet in his well. The
gas is now bubbling up in the water. The
Berry well is about a mile from the Munch
farm and about half a mile from the historic
well on the Thome place, wnich in an early
day took fire and so frigiitened the people that
they gathered en masse and tilled it up lest it
burn the whole country up. In this neighbor
hood is a farm upon which the squirrels throw
up from their burrows line coul. It is in this
same neighborhood that gas and petroleum
are running day and night from wells and
springs on the Brown farm. And yet nothing
is being done to prospect tne country and de
velop its magnificent possibilities. This valley
is full of mineral wonders and the time is
close at hand when astonishing reveiadons
will make lethargic capitalists disgusted with
themselves because they did not take the
trouble to investigate this country.
"Only a few weeks ago a poor farmer in So

iv underground exploration. It is speculating
for big stakes at small risks."

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
The Himalaya, troopship in the British navy,
has outlived her usefulness in active service,
and is being converted into a coal hulk for
Devonport. The Himuluya was built at BlacK
wail, and was launched on the Queen's birth
day, May 24, 1851. She was shortly after
sold to the Government, and remained in act
ive service from February, 1854, up to within
a year. The purchase price was $050,000, and
nearly $3,000,000 has been expended oo her
in new engines, boilers and repairs to hull
during the forty-one years' service. It is said
that tne iron bull is still in a splendid condi
tion, good for an indefinite number of years.
The Terrible, British navy, of 14,200 tons
and 25,000 horsepower, recently completed at
the yard of J. and G. Thomson, on the Clyde, is
said to be a failure. Labouchere claims that
all naval experts criticize the ship severely as
being unwieldy, with an inadequate arma
ment, and presenting an extensive target for
either shell or torpedo. She and her sister
ship, the Powerful, are both copper-sheathed,
Intended to reach a speed of 22 knots. The
contract price was $3,160,000 for the Terrible,
and $3,185,000 for the Powerful. The Colum
bia and Minneapolis, in the United States
navy, of 7350 tons ana trial speeds of 22.8
and 23.07 knois, cost $2,725,000 and $2,690,
-000 respectively.
There has been quite a number of "Ter
ribles" in the British navy, and also several
privateers by that name. A notable and des
perate engagement took place December 23,
17r>7, between the English privateer Terrible
and the French privateer Vengeance. The
Britisher was captured after a stubborn fight,
in which the captain and half the crew were
killea and the remainder wounded. It is re
called as a singular combination of dread ctr-
cumstances that the Terribfe had been fitted
out at Execution dock, was commanded by
Captain Death, the first lieutenant was known
as "Devil," and the surgeon was called
â¢'Ghost."
Phenomenal speeds have been developed by
recently built topedo-boats, notabiy in France
and England. The British torpedo-boat de
stroyer Desperate made a mean speed of 31.035
knots, or 35% statute miles, on four runs over
the measured mile course, and the Forban, the
latest French boat, made 31 knois. As the
Desperate has a length of 200 feet against the
Forban's 144.2 feet, the latter is unquestion
ably much the faster boat. The Forban, how
ever, is of very little practical use, as her coal
bunker capacity is only 15 tons, aliowing only
very short spurts of this exceptionally high
speed. Tho Desperate and her class carries
trom 60 to 70 tons of coal.
Diana of 5600 tons, copper-sheathed, built
by the Fairfield Shipbuilding Company for the
British navy, was launched in the short time
of 235 working days. The Eclipse, sister ship
to the Diana, built at the Portsmouth dock
yard, was launched exactly seven months after
her first keel plate had been laid.
The Entrecasteaux, French protected cruiser,
was recently launched at La Seyne. She is of
8114 tons, and intended to develop a speed of 19
knots. She is nearly an exact counterpart of
tlie United States cruiser New York.
The French Minister of Marine favors the
triple-screw system so successfully applied in
the United States cruisers Columbia and Min
neapolis. He recommends the building of im-
proved vessels of the Dupuy de Lome type, to
be 8300 tons' displacement and to carry two
nine-inch quick-tiring guns. The latter in
crease in quick-firing caliber from 6 inches to
9 inclus is probably an incorrect statement.
Argentina and Brazil are active making ad
ditions to their navy. The former has uur
chased two fine cruiser* from Italian builders
of 6840 lonr and 20 knots' speed. Brazil has
ordered several email vessels from Germany,
Engiand and France. The Coramura, a tor
pedo gunboat of 1030 tons, recently launched
at Kiel, is guaranteed to make a speed of 23
knots.

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE PER CAPITA CIRCULATION.
Correction of AN Error IN DISPATCHES
Which Is Misleading Many People. .
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sib:
The per capita circulation of all kinds of
money In the United States has been given
at $22 55 by nearly ail the papers during the
campaign, and in the silver edition of the Ex
aminer last Sunday the statement was re
peated, so we must consider the statement a
lact, or nearly correct at least.
In The Call yesterday was a telegram from
Washington In which it was stated that a
Treasury statement shows that all kinds of
money in the United States, outside of what is
?Â«n d fi^ th Â£, treasury, aggregated $1,539,
-109,634. or )jfj 48 per capita on an estimated
population of 71,649,000. This is on the nrst
day of September, and a. compared with last
year there had been a withdrawal of $64,413,
-394, or nearly $1 per capita. â¢
Some Popocratic friends of mine saw the
statement and cut it out of the paper to show
around town as proof of the statements their
jeaaers that the country was suffering from a
lacs of money. I was impelled by curiosity to
perform the division : and find that in some
way or other a mistake was made in transmit
ting the mesÃaÂ«o and that the amount per
W, 1 a% now in circulation is not $2 48, but
*-i 48. This is more ; like the figures we have
u-en accustomed :o read / and the mistaka
should be corrected. It is marvelous how
ranny people have ; cut out ; that little state
ment and are using iit to convince others to
think as they do. 1 have come across many.
Yours respectfully, Ernest McCULtOUOH.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
C. Steenbergh, who about five years ago be
gan cultivating the canaigre on a large ranch
near Brentwood, in Contra Costa County, le at
the Lick.
Mr. Steenbergh says he now has about 200
acres which are devoted to canaigre, and he
hopes in time to make considerable money out
of the business. But he says that growing the
plant and getting ready to realize dividends is
slow woric.
There is so much about the plant to learn.
Then, too, just how to prow it in the most ex
peditious and economical way is a problem
that with all its varied phases stays by the
grower for a long time. Mr. Steen burgh will

not beeln to harvest the first crop till next
year.
"The canaigre is asleep now," he said, in his
impressive way. "It sleeps in the summer and
grows In winter. It will be about December 1
before it will start in growing again.
"An average crop is from ten to twelve tons
an acre. About the tannery that has been
talked of from time to time, I hope to have
one built by next year, when we harvest our
first crop.
"Yon see it takes lots of capital to get a
caniagre enterprise like this started, and as
capital has, with this as with most enter
prises during the past few years, been slow,
we had to do the best we could. I think we
shall come out all rieht in the end, and that
the canaigre industry willeventually be a great
one in California."
The canaigre is to be used as a substitute for
tanbark, which has been growing compara
tively scarce in recent years. The canaigre is
said to have proved a good substitute when It
has been tried.
Macgrane Coxe of New York City, the re
cently appointed United States Minister to the
republics of Guatemala and Honduras, is at
the Palace Hotel awaiting the departure of the
steamship Colon, which will sail to-morrow
lor Central American ports. Mr. Coxe is a
young man, a lawyer by profession, and a
prominent figure in Gotham clubaom. He be
longs to the Century Club and the University
Club, conceded to be the best clubs in New
York, the Dramatic Club, the Tuxedo Club and
to several other similar organisations peculiar
to social aud business distinction and good
fellowship. Graduating from Yale University
in '79 Mr. Coxe entered the Columbia Law
School, from which he was graduated in '81.
Since that time he has been a practicing at
torney in the metropolis, making a specialty
of corporation law. During President Cleve
land's first administration he was appointed
by him United States District Attorney of New
York. His present appointment was also made
by President Cleveland, and is what is kuown
as a vacation appointment, made by the chief
executive during the recess ot Congress to till
an unexpected vacancy, for the former incum
bent, General P. M. B. Young of Georgia, died
recently, shortly aiter his arrival in New
York. The tenure of Mr. Coxe's office is there
fore conditional upon the continuation of his
appointment when Congress again convenes.
But theie is little probability that he will not
be permitted to continue to enjoy his posi
tion la the city of Guatemala, which he will
make his diplomatic residence. This is Mr.
Coxe'a first visit to the West, although he has
been in Mexico. He says that it i.i not neces
sary for a Minister to speak the language of
the country to which he is sent, as all diplo
matic matters are written and spokeu in the
language of the Minister's country.

seams but shoulder and uuder-arm. besides
the bias one in the back, so it appeals to the

. Woolsack âM. M., Porterville, Cal. Tho
woolsack is the seat of the Lord Chancellor of
England In the House of Lords, when acting
as presiding officer of that body. It is a square
bag of wool, without back or arms, covered
â with red cloth and was originally intended to
be emblematic of the fact that wool was the
great staple production of England. In the
reign of Queen Elizabeth an act of Parliament
was passed to prevent the exportation of wool
and that that source of national wealth might
be kept constantly in mind wool tacks were
placed in the House of Peers whereon the
Judges sat. Hence the Lord Chancellor, who
presides in the House of Lords, is said to "sit
on the woolsack," or to be "appointed to the
woolsack." A collator of ancient English
customs says that the jvoolcack first came
into use during the reign of Edward 111,
1327-77. '
! Standard Dollabs.â H..Nordhoff, Ventura
County, Cal. The statement that "the silver
dollar is not held up to the gold dollar by the
legal tender laws and not by the redemption
in gold, because the standard silver dollars are
not now redeemable in gold, either in law or
by administrative policy," Is correct. The
regulations of the Treasury Department
provide that "fractional silver coins
and coins of copper, bronze or copper-nickel
may be presented in sums or multiples of $20,
assorted in denominations in separate pack
ages, to the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer
for redemption or exchange into lawful money
and standard dollars /or exchange into silver cer
tificates only." For a time the sub-treasury at
San Francisco did, as a matter of accommoda
tion, exchange standard dollars for gold, but
about the Ist of August there was received a
notice that the rule above quoted must be
strictly followed.

Quotations From Gloomy
Verse.
Last eveninjr, about 6 o'clock, Salvador
Romero and Mrs. Rena Garcia, residents
of Redwood City, were found dead in
each other's arms in room 6 of the Alpha
lodging-house, on the corner of Mar
ket and East streets. They had commit
ted suicide by shooting, after leaving
several letters written In a despairing sen
timental strain stating their inten tion to
kill themselves.
The couple came to the place at 5 o'clock
Saturday evenine nnd took a room. They
did not register nor tell their names, and
Mrs. Luikins, tbe landlady, states that the
man and woman did not give any infor
mation regarding themselves, except that
they were short of money, but expected
to get some.
The woman appeared to be about 25 years
old and the man several years younger.
In his pocket, alter death, was found a
nickel, and iv her's a tiny, loaded, barrel
less revolver of a peculiar pattern. She
was clothed in a white muslin dress, a
brown coat and white straw hat, and he
in a dark coat und vest and light-blue
trousers.
They remained in their room Saturday
night and most all day yesterday.
About 6 o'clock last evening Joseph Luf
kins, the landlord, knocked at their door
and, receiving no answer, entered the
room through a window facing on East
atreet.
Their silence was at once explained.
The pair lay partially on a sofa and a
chair, locked in each other's arms, lifeless.
On the lioor near them was a small re
volver, and a bullethole in the breast ol
each told of its fatal work.
The two gaping wounds were directly
over the hearts of the man and woman,
showing that the shots were fired by a
band that never faltered. He must bave
shot her as she sat on the chair by the side
of the small sofa on which he was reclin
ing, and as she sank over against him he
drove the second builet into his own heart.
And ihey died there without a struggleâ a
double death well planned and well exe
cuted.
While the day sped by bringing the
night that would know no morning they
wrote. Both were Spanish, and sentiment,
mingled with despair, marked the paces
they penciled. The first note was to the
Coroner. "We have just a few more mo
ments to waste, the times Hies sway," it
said. "Please bury us tozether. Oh, if
we could knee! at your side and beg jou
better than in this letter. Farewell. S.
Romero and Rena Garcia."
Then the woman Rena Garcia took the
pencil and a sheet of note paper and wrote
to her brother and sister. Bhe spoke of
"Pellie," who would have something dis
creditable to say about her, and ended: "I
am tired of this world; good night."
Then the young man wrote to his
mother. It was a pathetic farewell:
If I could hear again your voice how happier
would I die. â¢ â¢ â¢ but I shall be dead and
gone. â¢ â¢ â¢ I love you till the last. You
would never have lost me if you had only
thought what you said before. â¢ â¢ â¢ a sweet
farewell to you and sisters. â¢ â¢ â¢ Taking
this revolver in my hand we bid you farewell.
â¢ â¢ â¢ Bury us together, we wish to keep
together * â¢ â¢ Good-night, forever. Your
SOQ i S. ROMKKO.
Then she took the pencil again and
wrote to her husband, telling him she
could not live any longer and must die:
lam tired o f this life and such people. lam
not leeling the least well and you know It your
self. â¢ â¢ â¢ You came in Jike a wild beast
scolding me. â¢ â¢ â¢ So we must part. â¢ â¢ â¢
Your family does not like me, so I think you
are better off. Your true wife,
Rena. R. Garcia.
The writer dropped the pencil for all
time and her companion laid his weapon
aside to add the quotations beginning:
Tread Â»oMy, bow the head.
In solemn silence bow;
No bell doth toll.
Yet an Immortal soul
Is passing now.
Then he wrote, "One more kiss let m c
press on those lips that never deceived me
** * for they will be cold and silent
now."
So the lines ran on till the close, then
he shot her. then himself and the Morgue
wagon carried them away.

JORDAN'S WORK
IN BERING SEA
Commission Collecting In
valuable Data About
Seals.
RETURN OF THE HOMER
Garfield's Son-in-Law Says Seal
ing Business Is "Piayed
Out."
BROUGHT BACK 30,000 i KINS.
Six Seizures Madeâ Jordan to Start
Home in Two Weeksâ Others
0a the Way.
The latest news of the Bering Sea Com
mission under Professor David Starr Jor
dan reached here yesterday when the
steamer Homer arrived, nine and a half
days from Unalaska with J. Stanley
Brown, superintendent of the North
American Commercial Company, and C.
H. Townsend of the United Slates Fish
Commission aboard.
Mr. Brown is a son-in-law of ex-Presi
dent James A. Garfieid, and was his sec
retary at the White House tip to the time
of the assassination. Ho passed through
this City May 22 on his way to the Priby
lof Islands.
"The Homer," said he yesterday at the
Occidental, -'brought from the Bering Sea
a cargo of 30,000 sealskins, being the quota
allotted by the Government to the North
American Commercial Company during
the past season.
"The catch of the sealing fleet this sea
son proves to be light. It is doubtful if
it will average 400 skins a vessel, or a
total of less than 30.000 skins. Sealers re
port seals scarcer than ever before, and
there is no pretense made that the small
catches have been due to inclement
weather. As the sealers put it, 'the busi
ness is played out.'
"The Bering Sea mixed commission of
Americans, British and Canadians, under
Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of Stan
lord University, arrived at St. George
Island, one of the Pribylof group, on July
6, and two days later came to St. Paul
Island, where are located our company's
headquarters.
"That commission is the finest body ot
men that could have been got together for
such tcientiiic investigation, witn the
preat commercial and international ques
tions attached to it. There is Prolessor
Jordan, the authority on fishes and a
scientist of world-wide reputation. He is
the only United States Commissioner, but
he is being assisted by such men as Dr.
Stejnegar of the National Museum at
Washington, who has no superior in the
field of natural history either in thiscoun
try or in Europe; Dr. Lucas, who has for
years occupied the position of curator of
mammals in tbe National Museum, and
is unsurpassed as an authority on com
parative osteology; C. H. Townsend of the
United States Fish Commission, who
has devoted years to familiarizing
himself with the methods of pelagic seal
ing; Colonel Joseph Murray, who has
been Government Agent on the seal islands
for six years and was detailed by Secre
tary Hainlin to assist the commission, and
Captain Moser of the Fish Commission
steamer Albatross, another experienced
man. The British.Commissioners are Pro
lesjsor Thompson of Dundee University,
Scotland, and Barrett Hamilton, a barris
ter of London, while the Canadian inter
ests are being looked after by Mr. Macoun,
a botanist of the Canadian Geological Sur
vey.
"The commis-ion will not cease its in
vestipatious until about the middle ot tuis
month or the Ist of October, when the
dead pups resulting from the shooting of
mothers at sea will have been counted.
"About the middle of August Dr. Jor
dan, accompanied by Pr fessor Thomp
son, also siartfd for the Commander
Islarda on the British warship Satellite,
leaving Dr. Lucas ana Secretary Clarke on
the Pribylof Islands tocont.nue work there.
"Dr. Jordan has probably returned to
Pribylof by this date. He will start for
home about tbe 20th of this month, but
will leave some of the party to complete
the work.
"The Albatross should arrive here this
mouth by way of Honolulu, fcj.je was to
visit the Commander Islands, off the coast
of Kamchatka. Robin Reel', in the Okhotsk
Sea, and tbe Kurile Islands, near Japan,
upon which seven or eight rookeries are
known to have existed.
"All the members of the commission
were in the best of health."
Mr. Townsend, when seen at the Palace
Hotel, said:
"Dr. Jordan asked me to say to any
newspaper man th;;t he knows of no other
cause so potent in the destruction oi a
great seal herd as pelagic, or ocean, seal
ing.
"The Bering Sea was thrown open in
1894 and thirty-eight vessels entered and
got 31,000 skins. In 1895 fifty-seven
vessels went in and took over 40,000 skins.
This year there are seventy vessels in
Bering S^a, but they will not get more
than 30,000 seals. They are bound to
make a light catch simply because there are
not seals enough. The catch of the thirty
three vessels boarded between August 19
and 24, amounted to 5900 skins, and t at i 3
for about half the fleet at very nearly the
middle of the season.
"The rookeries look bad, and pups are
already beginning to die because tbeir
mothers have been killed while outside
the sixty-mile limit hunting fish and pre
paring to return to the rookcrios to suckle
the pups for four or five day* before going
out again. The average catch for each ves
sel is yearly decreasing. This year it will
be 200 skins a vessel smaller than in 1895.
There was a light catch this season on tue
Japan coast. It amounted probably to
23,000 skins. I do not think any more
profitable catches will be made off that
coast.
"The Pribylof group of islands north of
the Alaskan archipelago is the great
breeding-ground for the American herd of
seal; the Commander group of islands,
near Kamchatka, on the Asiatic side is
tbe breedinjr-eround fr> r the seal herd of
that coast. The sea la from both these
great rookeries migrate southward in
summer without mingling and spread
over great areas of ocean. The Asiatic
herd gets as far south as Yokohama, tlie
American herd as far south as Santa
Barbara.
Russia's thirty-mile limit and America's
sixty-mile limit about the rookerit-sarein
effectual in preventing the extermination
of the seals. The United States could for
bid any of its vessels to engage in pelagic
sealing, but Canada might persist in
claiming rights in the open sea. If Canada
has rights it would pay our Government
to buy them.
"The North American Commercial Com
pany. which has the privilege of taKing
30,000 seals on the Pribylof Islands.pays the
Government flO for each skin ann gets
about $20 for it. The Pribylof skins taken
from superfluous young males of a com
mon age are uf uniform fineness of fur
and are highly puzed, while tbe males,
femaies and young taken at sea vary much
and bring only half the price."
FOREPAUGH'S CIRCUS.
The Combined Miowi Seem to Be the
Amusement Magnet of the Day.
The Forepaugh-Sells circus seems to be
the amusement magnet of the day. The
attendance has increased regularly since
the opening night and will probably conÂ«
tinue so until the conclusion of the en
gagement on Saturday night next.
There seems to be no gainsaying the
fact that it is the biggest aggregation of
the kind that has ever pitched canvas in
San Francisco. The performances thus
far have iiiven the greatest satisfaction,
and Central Park will more than likely be
the Mecca for the amusement devotees
during the coming week. Tlie arenio per
formances surpass anything of the kind
ever seen on the coast, and the zoological
department has proven a source of much
interest. The collection of animals 'neath
the big canvas will find few if any coun
terparts in the zoological gardens of the
world, and in itaelt is a source of educa
tion and edification.
Tbe performances in the amphitheater
proper bristles with novelties, an effort
evidently having been made to cast adrift
from the stereotyped features of circuses
of the past. The trained animal per
formances â the elephants and tbe seals â
have become subjects of conversation
throughout the City. In these two exhi
bitions the acme of perfection in animal
training seems surely to have been reached.
The hippodromatic events furnish an ex
citing conclusion to two hours of the r arest
piij'Â»ynÂ»ent that tbe people of San Fran
cisco have ever had under a circus canvas.
Two performances will be given daily
during the remainder of the week.
A Democratic Meeting.
Dr. J. L. Vcrk, Judge Tuompson, C. Backer
and other speakers will address the voters of
tbe Thirty-fourth Assembly District this
Tuesday night at 8 o'clock in ttie Mission
Opera-hah, Mission street, between Seven
teenth and Eighteenth, on the silver question.
A Bryan and silver club will be organized
Kverybody is invited to attend the meeting.

POPPER AND THE
RAINEY DRAGON
Max St. George to Save the
Junta From Its Aw
ful Fate.
AN EXCITING SABBATH
Wild Effort to Snatch the Conven
tion Frcm Rainey 's Grasp
by a Great Coup.
FOUR "AKAHCHISTS" WANTED
Ant -Raineyites Wili Appoint a Small
Convention or Bolt and Be Fierce
Non-Partisans.
Another fierce ar.d great revolution is
imminent in that remarkable political or
ganization which comprises the Junta fac
tion of the locil Democracy.
Since Sam Raiuey's control of the com
ing municipal convention was made evi
dent the other night the MeNub-Sullivan-
Popper-BrHunhart minority have been
pale and excited. It took the McNab end
a day or two to recover presence of mind,
but now a frantic and herculean effort to
save the convention from Rainey and
Lanigan is on.
Yesterday McNab, Braunhart, Popper,
Hasiett, Sullivan and a few other active
McNabers devoted the Sabbath to plan
ning and working :i preat coup by which
this salvation might be gained.
These noble politicians flew about town
until long after Sam Rainey and Ed
Lanigan went peacefully to bed. There
was a caucus at the resilience of Chairman
W. P. Sullivan, consultations on street
corners and in back rooms, and the speed
ing of messengers hither and thither.
An emergency generally brings forth a
man lor the hour and this emergency has
yielded its man. It's Max Popper. He
bugled "boots and saddles" to him
self on Saturday and dasbe 1 into
the danger. Max "has came" to
the front again. He is a politi
cal leader once more. When lie woKe up
the other day and realized that that Sam
Riiiney was boss of his political home he
jerked off his coat and swore that the boss
he desptsM even worse than he doe 9 Buck
ley should not rule again in Democracy.
So Popper is right at the front of this
saving lfort stirring his boots and work
ing like a beaver in the interest ot the
little dash of "decency" there ia ia the
Junta outfit.
This saving coup is a brilliant one. The
plan is that tlie campaign committee shall
rescind its order of last week, making
the convention consist of the 4f>W members
NEW TO-DAT.
Money Back
Giving money back seems
quite a virtue. .
We've given money back,
if wanted, for 30 years and
considered it only good busi-
ness sense.
Maybe we've been better
than we knew of.
Money back protects the
buyer, protects honest goods
â altogether it's a good
thing.
Your money back if our
furniture isn't right.

of the general committee and 150 at iarge
to be appointed pro rata by the members
of tne campaign committee. It has been
figured out to a certainty that Rainey and-
Lani-an together can have their own way
with such a convention.
Having rescinded this ord r the plan is
to adopt a resolution providing that the
campaign committee shall appoint out
right a campaign convention of 300 mem
ber* or loss.
'11. is would shut ont the ; eneral com
mittee in which Rainey and Lanigan con
trol a majority, and a majority of the
campaign committee of twenty, it it could
nans to?< ther on a programme, could do
as it p!ea-ed with its own convention.
Then iiavm MeNab's programme might
siide nions with some slight approach to
tbe Mnootuuess with which Buckley's pru
graninio goes at li'nai B'rith Hall.
iSut the trcublp witn this coup and the
contingency on which its success depends
is the getting of fourteen votes for it in
the campaign committee. The campaign
committee is to meet to-night to appoint
the 150 delegates at large. And some votes
for this revolutionary ''cinch" programme
must be guintd before niehtftll. That
meeting to-nigtit is likely to be mighty
inirre.stin?.
The "McNab" faction in the campaign
enmmittey comprises nine votes â Gavin
McNab, W. P. SuiJivan, George T. Marye,
A. A. Watkin?, Peter Quinn, Samuel
Braunhart, M. C. liassett, James Butler,
Timothy Donovan. Captain Kitzpatrick,
representing the Thirtieth Di?trict, was
bought a few weeks ago with a job in the
Mint, and as his vote belongs to Daggett
he has been counted with the .Rainey
vote.
At the last meeting of the campaign
committee, however, he surprised every
body by voting for McNab' s programme.
Should he do so to-ui^ht it will give Mc-
Nab ten votes.
Besiues Fitzpatrick Rainey has but one
vote in the campaign committee, that of
Joseph P. Hayes of Eddie Greany's dis
trict. Lanigan has one vote â John
Meuh. J. J. Harvey, the post warden, has
ruver been counted with the Rainey
lies, but he has no use ior McNab, and the
other nignt he denounced MÂ»:N;binthe
committee meeting and presented the
Rainey programme.
Tae six left are the "anarchists." They
are Secretary McGovern, M. Tierney,
George A. Love. John O'Donneli, R. L.
Mann, and Dr. W. J. Gavigan. These have
revolted against McNab, formed a solid
compact and taken an independent posi
tion between the Rainey and McNab
factions. By holding together they can
dictate terms, as without them the four
teen votes necessary to pass a convention
measure cannot be obtained. The McNab-
Popper faction will have to buy up those
of the anarchists with bigper concessions
of convention power than Rainey will give
to accomplish that coup. Quotations on
anarchists will be high to-day.
Popper is an old hand at convention
and campaign management, and MiNab's
great "hold" is combinations, but then
Sam Rainey was born before last Tuesday.
The Rainey people laughed yesterday
at Popper's entry into the fray and they
feared him not.
"Max is a lobster," said one of the
Rainey lieutenants, who Knew racetrack
slant;.
If the McNab minority does not suc
ceed by its usual "cinch" methods in nam
ing outright a convention of its own and
Rainey and Lanigan are able to hold in
operation the present plan there will be a
NEW TO-DAY.

different sort of a revolution and more
gaiety for the public.
The anti-Raineyites are already pacting
up their things to get out if Rainey has
the convention when it comes. They are
already talking of bolting. They will cet
right up and march out of the convention
hall and damn the whole local Demo
cratic party. As there will hardly be
time to gel up a third faction and call it
the ''Democracy," th^ra will be nothing
left but some non-partisan movement â in
fact, they doa't know where they would
go then.
Of course, in that event Rainey and
Buckley could set down together in peace
and direct their respective followers to
fall on each other's necks.
Meantime just watch Buckley and

strides of local Democratic patriots with

MADE TOO MANY ERRORS
St. Ignatius College Team De
feated the Pacifies in a
Poor Game.
San Francisco Players Eisily Disposed
of the Delegation From
Oik and.
For two wearisome hours and thirty-five
dreary minutes ball game at the Presidio
dracged along yesterday amid kicks, con
troversies, delays and minor causes of
misery too numerous to mention.
The whole matter was a grand mistake.
In the first place the game was to have
been between the teams of the St. Mary's
and St. Ignatius colleges. Through the
mistake of some one the former team chal
lenged the latter. St. Ignatius accepted,
but St. Mary's refused to play because
the sender of the challenge was not au
thorized to do so. Because of the failure
of the St. Mary's team to put in an ap
pearance the umpire awarded the game to
St. Ignatius by a technical score of 9 to 0.
The Pacifies were prepared to tase the
place of the defaulting club, and there
began as tiresome a spectacle as has been
seen on a ball Held in this City.
For six innings the score was a close
one. but the play lacked the snap and en
deavor that are expected in collegiate con
tests, the only enlivening feature being
the exaggerated objections of Captain Mo
Dermott, who found something not to his
liking in every other move.
In the seventh inning Mansfield, the
Pacific pitcher, let down, and after giving
four bases on balls was touched up lor a
single and a double, which, with a couple
of errors, netted the college boys seven
runs, but one of which was earned.
Had it not been lor the sudden collapse
of their twirler the Pacifies would prob
ably have won, there being really but live
players on the college team, the other four
participants being almost useless.

Yesterday morning the weather was not
promising in the city, but notwithstand
ing a party which required eicht coaches
left via the Tiburon ferry on a special
boat at 8:30 a. m. for the Bohemia bin
trees, under the personal direction of Ex
cursion Manager Locse.
By the time San Rafael was reached the
line of the foe belt was passed and the most
delightful weather was experienced. Good
time was made on the run to the
and the excursionists were given a half
hour longer than the promised four hours'
stay in tbe reawoods. There was not a
hitch in the arrangements and a most
pleasant outing was enjoyed, the people
beinjr charmed with the natural attrac
tions of the ride and the section visited.
The homeward trip was begun at 4:30

8 o'clock boat from the Sausalito ferry and
the second train with tlie 10 o'clock boat.
The fare Jor the round trip on this special
occasion will be only 75 cents, children
under 12 years 40 cents, and it will be
necessary to procure tictcets from Mr.
Locke, as- none will be on sale at tne offices
ot the railroad company.
"HER CURSE ON
EVERY COUNTRY"
W. T. Fleenor Says Rome
Has Blighted Every
Catholic Nation.
EAS FOSTERED PERJURY
Canonical Law Cited to Show a
Dsregaid of Solemn
Obligations.
AMERICA THE MOST LIBERAL.
This Country Declared to Accord Cath
olics More Privileges Thau
Any Other.
W. T. Fleenor of Beattle, who has occu
pied the platform at the Good Citizenship
meetings at Metropolitan Temple lor sev
eral Sunday? past, sooke yesterday after
noon on the topic, "Is Papalism Conserva
tive of Good Government?"
"Mr. Yorko protests against as bringing
up the sinÂ« of 1900 years ago," he said,
"and casting them in the face of the pres
ent generation. 1 don't see why Mr.
Yorke cannot take his sauce with a pood
relislj. He has been pome back into Mr.
Hudelson's sins for I don't know how
lone, and I don't see why what is sauce
for the goose should not be sauce for the
gander. He seems to be so well posted
that he says Mr. Huaelson's record was
soon to be aired in the courts. lam glad
he is so well posted. The reverend
gentleman may be called into court to tell
what he knows about the matter.
"The American Protective Association
is set tor the defense of this Government
against papalism and Romanism. When
the Roman hierarchy takes its hand out of
the public treasury, quit* plotting against
our Nation and quits cursing our institu
tions, t is organization will disband until
some other monster rears its head.
"Last Friday night Archbishop Riordan
said that the American constitution was of
Catholic origin. lam oppoatd to disturb
ing the ashes of Jefft-rson, Monroe and
Patrick Henry. Let them rest without
casting aspersions upon their patriotism.
The reverend gentleman closed his little
speech by advising the ladies of the land
to stay at home and devote their energies
to raising children. I would like to know
what a Catholic priest knows about rais
ing children.
"The immortal Lincoln says that good
government is a government of the peo
ple, by the peopie and for the people.
These are the conditions that papalism
must meet or forever withdraw from
American politics, The first proposition
that I offer under this head is: 'Is papal
ism constitutionally conservative to good
government?' If papalism has nothing
but war and blood for this Nation then it
must seek its affiliations elsewhere. We
assert that this is a good government.
Swift and sure will be the retribution of
that power that seek? to prostitute and
vitiate the policy of the American people.
"In 1870 the Vatican council decreed the
infallibility of the Pope. Now we have
papal Rome. The Pope asserts that he has
arbitrary power over life and destiny.
This is canonical law: "The Pope has the
right to give countries whicli are non-
Catholic to Catholic regents and reduce
them to slavery.' Let me tell you tnis
Nation fought and warred to stopslavery,
and it will right again if need be to pre
vent slavery."
The speaker here quoted what lie claims
were extracts from canonical law to the
effect that the church and its priests should
not be taxed without the Pope's consent.
"Mr. Yorke expressed this sentiment,"
he continued, ''when he said the tax upon
the Presentation Convent in this City was
unjust, and yet they say they love this
country.
" 'The Pope can relieve from every oath
or obligation, either before or after it is
taken.' This is canonical law. How do
we know that every Romanist who comes
to this country is not already absolved
from his oath of allegiance? This is the
kind oi villainy and perjury that we have
to meet in this country."
Mr. Fleenor cited the condition of coun
tries uuder Catholic control to-day to
show that Rome had cursed Â»very nation
it gained a foothoid in. America, he
claimed, gave Catholics more liberties
than * any country on the giobe.
He declared it was the only country
where the nunneries were not open to
public inspection, and he predicted the
locks would soon be legislated off their
doors here.
"Saiolli was 3ent to this country under
the pretense of representing the Pope at
the Columbian Exposition," he continued.
"It was really as a permanent abiegate
Â»t Washington. I want to tell you
that, although Mr. Cleveland has said
nothnc about it, Rome has audience in
the halls at Washington. This morning's
paper tells us that Archbishop Ireland of
t*t. Paul announces that the parochial
school* will hereafter charge no tuition
fee. What does this mean? It means that
the poor Catholics are to be doubly taxed
to support these institutions that they
may better com.pt.te with American free
schools."
He closed with an appeal to his auditors
to remain true to America and American
institutions.
ACTS OF VANDALISM.
Four Boys Raise a Disturbance in a
Church and Two Are Arrested
for Being Drunk.
Four grown-up boys, under the influence
of liquor, went into the Star of the Sea
Chinch, Eighth avenue and Point Lobus
road, yeslerday afternoon, and amused
themselves by raising a disturbance. They
emptied the ble-sed water out of the font,
kicued over seats and did other acts of
vandalism.
Policeman J. B. O'Connor was notified
and arrested two of the youngsters. Rev.
i he v Covle refused to prosecute tiiem
and they were booked at the City Prison
on the charge of drunkenness. Their
names are Joseph Clark and Albert Bahn,
both shoemakers, and IS years of age.
A NEW POLYCLINIC.
It Will Treat the Deserving Poor Free
of Chttrgo.
A worthy Institution, which should
claim the attention of ail charitably dis
posed people, is about to be opened at 113
Nintn street.
This U the Po<yclinic Free Dispensary,
which has for its object the treatment of
the worthy sick poor free of charge. A
number of charitable ladies have already
taKen the matter in charge and hope to
meet with a deserved success. Several
prominent physicians have gratuitously
ottered their services, giving a certain
number of hours each week, which will
include al! tne ifferent branches of sur
gery and medicines.
On account of the very hard times
nnndieds of deserving sick people are un
able to secure medic il attention, on ac
count of not bavin? the necessary lew dol

UNITED PARTY
Passing of the Old Machine
in Alameda
County.
HOPE FOR REPUBLICANS
Relief From Those Who for Two
Years Trailed the Party
in the Dust
OAKLANDERS ABHOR PENNIES
The Army and Navy Republican
League Set an Example That
Is Worth Following.
OAXLAin} Ofticb Sas Fbaxcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 6. f
The Republican County Central Com
mittee framed its death warrant yesterday
when it decided upon a call for the county
convention. It is hardly likely that any
of the members will be re-elected, and the
Republican party in Alameda County is
justly rejoicing. To the maladministra
tion of the present county committee is
directly traceable all the dissension that
has soiled the party's escutcheon during
the past two years and which all Repub
licans, who are such for principle only,
unite in deploring. The present commit
tee, although not elected till the close of
the last county convention, naturally
dominated that convention, and their at
tempts to force upon the Republican
voters candidates who were merely clay
in the hands of the potter brought about
the disruption of the party in what was
for many years the banner Republican
county in this State.
Nothing could be done till the opening
of the present campaign and the Repub
lican party proper asserted itself. Its first
step was to prevent the County Commit
tee from resolving itself into a campaign
committee in the interest of a congres
sional candidate. The State Central Com
mittee ordered that all delegates should
be elected at primaries, and as proof of its
judgment being right and in the best in
terests of the party it only remains to be
said that not one of the delegates elected
by the County Committee was elected at
the primaries.
The history of the present County Com
mittee has been a history of scandals.
For a long while it could not meet for
lack of a quorum. County Committeem en
who should have been attending to the
trust reposed in them would look out of
the windows of surrounding offices and
make fun at the efforts of the minority to
obtain a quorum.
This spirit actuated the majority of the
men who, for a time, were the figureheads
of the party. That they were never in con
trol is best proved by the fact that when
ever an issue went before the party at
large it has invariably been defeated. Any
man who goes before tne people this No
vember wearing the political livery of
"the machine" had better withdraw from
the contest.
It is far better that the present crisis
should have occurred in a Presidential
year, because it will be much easier to re
store decency and unity to the party un
der a banner inscribed with McKinley and
Hobart than any other. To perpetuate a
family or clique in office is not Republi
canism, although it is all the party fealty
ever shown by the fast-dying committee.
In the History of Alameda County
(1876), referring to the first county election
in 1803 is this paragraph:
Those who had the largest share in shaping
affairs in the new county at the start were
Henry C. Bmith, Judge A. M. Crane, A. M.
Church and Horace W. Carpentier. The
southerly end possessed the controlling influ
ence, as it carried off the county seat and
nearly, if not all, the offices.
Thus was the Church-Carpentier alliance
launched upon this county at its very
birth and the same, under slightly differ
ent environments, continues to this day.
And this is the reason the lobby langhed
yesterday afternoon when County Com
mitteeman Rod Church declared dramat
ically that be had no other interest at
heart than the good of the Republican
party. As proved at the last primary Mr.
Church is wrong, for the machine and the
railroad are not the Republican party in
Alameda County.
William R. Davis, George C. Pardee,
Guy C. Earl, W. H. Friend, C. G. Dodge,'
W. W. Knickerbocker and many others
associated with them have undertaken to
regain for this connty the Republican
banner that was carried south about two
years ago, and it is believed they will do
it. They have proved their ability to
carry the county, and there is no doubt
that the next primary will be a repetition
of the lastâ a complete repudiation of the
County Committee.
Oakland has no use for pennies nor for
penny papers- The little brown coin was
very unpopular during the few weeks an
attempt was made to introduce it in this
city. One conductor on the Alameda
road, although probably not rich enough
to throw money away, fairly expressed
the sentiment of the majority. He took
five pennies from a passenger and then
indignantly tossed them into the marsh
with the remark, "I don't intend to turn
in such trash as that." Merchants did
not like them and about the only thing
that they would purchase was the penny
paper that tried to introduce them. They
and the paper disappeared together. There
was a general feeling that to deal with
pennies instead of nickels was the inau
guration of a cheaper age than that which
we now enjoy and all are pleased at their
disappearance, except the man who pre
sented a handful to a Southern Pacific
collector, had them refused and brought a
damage suit. To him and the company
their memory is still dear, though in
different ways. ; ' ' â 
The Army and Navy Republican League
of Oakland has set an example that is
worth following in every town and city in
the country. They have fitted up a large,
well-lighted and comfortable hall on
Eighth street in which to hold regular
meetings. The main object, however.
has really become a minor one. Instead
of closing up the hall as soon as a meet
ing is finished it is maintained as an open
reading and club room. . It is well-kept
and the large tables are supplied with the
cream of Republican campaign literature
and never less than fifty veterans are
tnkini: advantage of Alt is a recognized.
campaign center and is the only one of its
kind in this city. S. W. B.
EXIT, THE MANAGER.
Tbe Veterans' Entertainment at Hay
wardi Was Not Given.
HAYWARDS, Cax., Sept. 6.â There was
to have been an entertainment here last
night for the benefit of the fund for pur
chasing a burial plot for the veterans. The
audience assembled, but the greater part
of the talent was not present and the
manager had disappeared.
William Lansing, the manager, who was
staying in Haywards for his health, had
consented to manage the entertainment.
It was advertised and seemed to be well
attended to, but last night Lansing could
not be found, his arrangements could not
be learned and some of the veterans had
to announce that there would be a dance
and that the entertainment would begiven
two weeks hence. No reason can be given
for Lansing's disappearance nor can he be
found.
League of the Cross Bally
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 6.â The first

noon at the convent school, in West

ent, completely filling the hall. The cen
tral topic of discussion was temperance.

Dedication of the Pioneer Scan
dinavian Baptist Church of
the State.
From a Small Beginning the Congre
gation Grew Till It Needed Its
Own House of Worship.
Oaklakd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Bept. 6. f
The Danish and Norwegian Baptists
now have a pretty house of worship of
their own. This afternoon their new
edifice was dedicated to the service of God
by Rev. C. M. Hill, pastor of the Ninth
avenue Baptist Church of East Oakland.
The new church, which is the first Bap
tist church to be built by Danish and
Norwegian citiiens in California, is
located near the corner of Twenty-fifth
avenue and East Fourteenth street. It
was organized in July, 1891, with twelve
members, and this increased till there is
now a comparatively large congregation.
Rev. N. lysehesen, the pastor, made a
few historical remarks. Rev. Knute Nel
son was pastor for the first year, and the
present pastor was called in January, 1893.
For a year the regular meetings were
held at Woodmen's Hall; after that the
congregation moved to Liberty Hall and
later to the Pythian buildinc at Twenty
third avenue. The members and their
friends have been liberal enough to start
the church out free of debt.
Rev. C. M. Hill delivered a short and
appropriate address and formally declared
the place to be at God's service." Rev. C.
H. Hobart, Rev. R. Whittater and Rev.
W. H. Latourette were also present.
THEY RODE IN DEEP MUD
The Relay Impeded by a Great
Storm in the Lake
Region.
New York, the Destination of the
Packet, Will Be Reached at
No^n To-Day.
Saturday night, all day yesterday and
last night the couriers of the New York
Journal and San Francisco Examiner bi
cycle relay floundered through mud and
water. The riders have traveled with the
rainstorm from the Missouri River to
Lake Erie. They are now twenty-four
hours behind schedule time, and will fin
ish the long journey about noon to-day
fully that much out of the reckoning.
The following special dispatches to Thk
Call tell of the hard features of the trip
from Erie, Pa., to Utica, N. V. :
BUFFALO, N. V., Sept. 6.â ln the face
of a storm and over road 3 into which the
tires sank over the rim, the hardy young
athletes to whom was intrusted the Jour
nal-Examiner packet brought it through
from Erie last night, reaching this city at
7:10 a. m. Rochester was reached at 12:05
F. M.
The Buffalo section, Erie to Rochester,
175 miles, was run in just seventeen hours.
The run from Buffalo to Rochester, 70
miles, was made at the rate of fourteen
miles an hour. Rain fell during the en
tire journey from Erie, and the roads were
in bad condition.
SYRACUSE, N. V., Sept. 6.â The Jour
nal-Examiner transcontinental relay race
messengers reached this city at 5:23 this
afternoon. Corporal A. E. Weed and
Harry Henry of Cortland came in from
Camillus on a tandem, covering eight
miles in eighteen minutes, a marvelous
ride under the circumstances, as the recent
rains had left the highways in a bad con
dition. Out of Syracuse excellent time
was made, and many minutes were made
up on the time lost in Ohio. Utica was
reached at 9:20 P. M.
The packet was due at Utica, N. V., at
7:44 p. m. September 5, but did not arrive
there until 9:20 p. it. September 6.
Couriers C. V. Horan, A. McCarthy,
Mike Leary and C. E. Lang sent this dis
patch to the Examiner:
BOWMANSVILLE, N. V., Sept. 6.-After rid
ing In the rain for seven hours arrived at
Bowmansville 7:30 A. M.
Harry Henry was chosen for the Ca
millus run because of his skill and daring.
He had to ride down Camilius Hill, near
Syracuse, a grade of 300 feet in one mile.
It is a descent which riders say is worse
than a toboggan slide.
At Syracuse 3000 people assembled to
hail the couriers. The riders came in
with mud clinging to their wheels. Three
minutes was the time of each of the
twenty-four miles of the run.
Saturday night two couriers started
from Silver Creek to Evans, thirteen
miles distant. Four n,iles out they floun
dered in the mud and darkness. The
water was so deep that they had to take
the Lake Snore railroad track. They had
just time to get out of the way of a freight
train. In wandering about with their
lanterns they stopped another train, the
engineer mistaking their lights for a sig
nal.
The couriers will be in Albany, 150
miles from New York, early this morn
ing. It is figured now that the packet will
ireach its destination at noon to-day.
Apparition of the Virgin.
CITY OF MEXICO, Mexico, Sept, 6.â
The question of the reality of the appari

Camacho, Bishop of Tamaulipas, has been

matter.

Death was present at the re-dedication
services of tho synagogue of the First He

who was the first president of the congre

young.
Jacob Letter, to whom had been as

one shoulder and a minute later he died.

nounced, and until the ceremonies were
over the congregation was not aware of
the reason why their pioneer president
had not kindled the perpetual spark.
For some time past Mr. Letter has been
quite feeble. He was past 79 years of age,
but when it came time to rededicate the
synagogue, which has been removed to
Twelfth and Castro streets and thor
oughly renovated, he determined to be
present at the ceremony. His physician
advised against it, but he persisted and
went. He resides at 1016 Clay street, only
three and a half blocks from the syna-

dedicated With Beautiful Ceremony Yesterday.
gogne, and so walked down there this
afternoon.
The act of lighting the perpetual light
is the highest honor which can be con
ferred on a layman in the dedication
service, and in recognition of his past
services he was chosen for this duty in the
rededication of the renovated synagocne.
He reached the steps nearly exhausted,
and Special Officer Vose, who was stand
ing at hand, offered his arm and assisted
him inside and to a seat in an empty
room below the main auditorium.
As Mr. Letter took his seat he pushed
his hat back and fell back into the arms of
those attending nim, expiring instantly.
When it was seen that he was unconscious
word was sent upstairs, and Dr. J. R.
Bradway. who was in the auditorium, was
called. When he arrived beside the body
he pronounced life extinct. Efforts, how
ever, were made to induce respiration by
artificial means, but to no avail.
Mrs. Letter and her son Benjamin, who
were in the congregation, were quietly
taken below before they were informed of
what had happened.
As soon as the congregation had all ar
rived, half a dozen friends carried the
body out the front, placed it in a hack
and removed it to his late residence.
Mr. Letter was a pioneer resident of
Oakland, having come here in the forties,
and has been in business here ever since.
He was the first president of the syna
gogue, in 1875, serving several terms, and
has always been one of the mainstays of
the coneregation. He was also a member
of the B'nai B'rith, Royal Arch Ma3ons,
I. 0. O. F., and the Encampment of the
latter. He leaves a widow, wno has a
daughter, Miss Rebecca Philips, by a for
mer husband, and three children/Benja
min and George, sons, who were in busi
ness with him on Broadway, and a
daughter, Mrs. Ida Swartz of Santa Cruz
THE DEDICATION.

dress, and Children Sin?
"Hall, O Israel."
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 6.âThe rededi
cation services in the beautiful auditorium
were carried out without a hitch.
The opening of the ark and taking there
from the sacred scrolls were p erformed by
President Julius Abrahamson. Rabbi M.
Friedlander read a selection from Genesis,
after which he lit the perpetual light. The"
temple invocation was given by E. Bern
stein, and the dedicatory by Rabbi J.
Nietoof San Francisco. The sacred scrolls
were restored to the ark by J. Rosen bers,
and the keys of the building were pre
sented by S. Kahn of the building com
mittee.
Rabbi J. Voorsanger of San ifrancisco
delivered the dedicatory sermon. It was
a masterly effort, and he was compli
mented by many afterward. He gave a
complete account of the synagogue, from
the early Jewish days to the present time,
and urged his hearers to a higher and ho
lier life hs they now began to worship in
the renewed house.
Rabbi M. Friedlander consecrated the
edifice, and Rabbi M. S. Levy made an
address, aftor which the service was
closed by Rabbi J. Fryer by a fervent
prayer.

AFTER MANY MILLIONS
General Hart Makes an Interesting
Report on the Valuable Har
lem Tract.
General W. H. H. Hart has just re
turned from New York, where he has been
in the interest of the Pacific Coast Asso
ciation of Harlem and Aneke Jans Heirs.
At a meeting held on Saturday night at
320 Post street the well-known attorney
made a lengthy report of what be had ac
complished during his sojourn in the
Eastern metropolis.
General Hart reported that the Su
preme Court of New York decided in 1887
that the Harlem Tract belonged to the
following heirs: John Dfilvallo, Joish
Obeiinus, Isaac Delamater, Adolph Meyer,
Jan Dykemann. Peter Obeiinus, Hester
Delamater, William Haldron, Peter
Mermedier, Resolved Waldron, Barent
Waldron, Daniel Tiernier, John Spragge ,
John Devost, Lawrence Jassen, Jan
Magel, Cornelius Jansen, Jaqualine
Tournear, Johanuis Vervelan, Abraham
Fountain.
The attorney stated that all required of
the heirs of the parties named was to pro
duce proof of relationship and they would
receive their proportion of the property
which is valued at $300,000,000. The local
association numbers about 150, among
whom may be mentioned H. O. Brower,
L. M. McKenney, Dr. B. B. Brower, Al
fred Clement, Mrs. J. S. Halsted, Mrs. A.
M. Fettes, Mrs. H. de la Montanya. Mrs.
J. A. Hall, Mrs. M. H. Koster, W. H.
FrancLioo, F. B. Gee, Miss Susie Prindle,
Henry M. McKenney and J. G. Brower.
It is the purpose of the various associa
tions throughout the United States to ask
the Supreme Court of New York to assess
the property 1 per cent in order to create a
fund, which will be used in establishing
the claims of those who are too poor to
bear the burden. A new organization was
formed, with H. 0. Brower, president; 11.
H. Francisco of the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe road, secretary, and Mrs. J. A.
Hall, treasurer.
The story of the litigation over the Har
lem and Trinity church property is older
than the Declaration of Independence,
but there geems to be no reason now to
doubt that the Harlem tract is in a fair
way to return to the rightful owners.

CRICKET ACROSS THE BAY
The Pacific and Alameda Clubs Gain
Decisive Victories.
The cup cricket matches played yester
day resulted in favor of the Pacifies and
Alamedas. The former were pitted
against the Bohemians at Alameda and
came off conquerors by 9 wickets. Going
in first, the Bohemians, who were 8 men
short, were dismissed for 61 runs, 17 of
which were due to Reeves. The small
score was mainly due to Dickinson's
bowling and to the Pacifics 1 smart fielding.
But, small though the total was, it
would probably have suffered had it not
been for the Pacifics 1 star batsman, Rich
ardsoh. who, though giving a fairly good
chance in the deep field, put up a useful
inning of 53. The whole side compiled
82, tbe runs being ably kept down by
Robertson and Cookson.
In their second essay the Bohemians
only managed to compile 45, Bowhill and
Aitken doing most of the work. This left
the Pacifies 15 runs short of victory, which
were made at the expense of one wicket.
The game was without any particular fea
ture. The score:

REALTY MARKET REVIEW,
A Good Many Sales Reported
and a Better Feeling
Prevails.
AUGUST BUSINESS RECORD.
A Variety of Building ani Mis
cellaneous Notes of
Interest.
Magee's Real Estate Circular contains the
following review of tne real estate market for
the month of August :
Considering the disturbed condition of
financial affairs generally, and that the foolish
hoarding of money has been so great that
there is said to be not a single box to let in
any of the safe deposit companies of the City,
there was a very good demaud for City real
estate last month. The most of the buyers
are persons of limited means, their purchases
ranging from $ 1000 to $4000. There are, how
ever, also, a good many investors of sums
ranging from $20,000 to $50,000, but of large
buyers, willinir to invest from $100,000 up
ward, there are very few. They find it almost
impossible, too, to get what they are after, be
cause, low as the prices of even the best prop
erties now for sale are, none of them are low
enough to suit present large buyers. There is
at present an unusually small amount of good
property lor sale, owntrs seeing nothing better
in which to invest their money.
We never remember a time when good aver
age vacant lots, all things considered, could
nave been bought so cheap as they can at
present. Lots near the park, which were
$â  3000 tn $3 ( 50 each between the years 1889
and 1891. can now be had for $1800 to 52700
each. Even on Pacific Heights prices for
vacant land have Deen materially reduced.
Fairly located property there can now be
bought for 25 per cent lest than itconldtwo
to four years ago. The very best property
there, however, still holds its own. Those who
ever mean to acquire a homestead here should
note these facts.
The following is also from Magee's Circular:

Naturally the savings banks did not lend
much last month, in view of the demand for
money on the part of depositors. Private
lenders have been partially, and are now able
wholly to supply all the money needed by real
estate borrowers. One loan of $150,000, due
to a savings bank, was taken at once by a pri
vate lender. The latter class is apt to ask 1
per cent a year more than the highest rate
charged by the banks.
Money n in much better supply at the sav
ings banks than it was three weeks to a month
ago, the demand lor money for hoarding pur
poses having in a great measure ceased, while
receipts for Interest from country borrowers
have been large for such an early period of the
harvest season. Many loans overdue have
been paid off, too, and much money has come
in from new depositors. Except for the state
of suspense due to the Presidential election,
affairs wouid soon be in their normal condi
tion.
The total number of mortgages recorded last
month was 293, of the value of $1,165,718,
and of releases there were 192, of the value of
$827,300.

Will E. Fisher <fc Co. report an unusually
heavy demand for houses and flats for this
season of the year. They say that the demand
ior nudern dwellings exceeds the supply, ow
ing to the limited number of first-class homes
and flats, especially houses, for rent. Among
the recent leases made by this firm is that ot
tbe Alexandria Hotel property on Sutter
street, belonging to the Wallace estate, and
the property of Chris Buckiey on Stockton
street, near Sutter, which will be converted
into a boardintr-house. They have also leased
to Mr. Hammersmith the Morgan residence on
Oak street.
Among recent tales made by this firm are
the following: Lot on Folsom street, between
Seventeenth and Eighteenth, for $1850; lot
25x122:6 on Shotwell street. In the same
block, for $1400; \vt 100x100 on Point Loboa

sider the prospects for an active fall and
winter market as very good.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES.
David Bush, who for the past year and a half
conducted the country department of O'Far
rell & Co., has associated himself with G. H.
Umbsea & Co., where he will look after coun
try business. It Is but Just to Mr. Bush to say
that he did not In any manner participate In
the failure of O'Farrell & Co. His department
was to a certain extent quite distinct and in
dependent from the remainder of O'Farrell &
Co. s business, and during Mr. Bush's connec
tion with the house the transactions consum
mated by him were so large and numerous
.that thoy yielded a very handsome revenue
and formed a substantial portion of O'Farrell
& Co.'s Income during the period Mr. Bush was
with the firm.
Mr. Bush is well known as one of the most
active and energetic as well as most reliable
real-estate men in the City. In handling coun
try Dusiness he is especialiy adept, as he knows
almost every foot of land in th* State. His as
sociation with such a strong and well-known
firm as G. H. Umbsen <fc Co. will enable him to
enjoy especially favorable facilities for con
ducting his department. He has contracts for
the sale of many desirable properties, and his
lists of offerings published from week to week
will be found to contain many choice bargain!
in country lands, the locations of which em
brace the cream of California's fertile valleys.
The residents of Sunnyslde and adjoining
tracts have unanimously petitioned the Board
of Supervisors to extend Bosworth street from
Lyell, opposite Castro, through to Sunnyside
avenue. This would give them direct connec
tion from Sunnyside to Mission street, oppo
site St. Mary's College. Ai all property-owners
are in favor of the extension they feel that the
board should grant their petition.
G. H. UmDsen & Co. will sell at auction
Thursday noon, September 10, by order of ad
ministraor, the following pieces of property :
Lot 30x137:6 and improvements at 1225 Bush
street, between Hyde and Larkin. The im
provements consist of a house of fifteen rooms
and bath. Also the property at the southwest
corner of O'Farrell street and Carlos place, be
tween Mason and Powell streets, being 221 to
2.7 1 ; O'Farrell street and 10 and 12 Carlos
place. The lot is 57:6x97:6 with an L, and
Improvements consist of several buildings in
stores and flats.
M. J. Lyon, the architect, has completed
plans for extensive alterations in the Baldwin
Hotel that will cost about $20,000. The
billiard-room is to be transformed into a grill
room 32x60 feet, the Interior oi which will be
handsomely decorated and wainscoted in
Tennessee marble. The present ladies' cafe ia
to be converted into a bar and the billiard
room is to be removed to the basement, access
to which will be hud by means of abroad
marble staircase leading from the bar. A new
plate-giass front to the grillroom will be con
structed with an entrance from Powell street.
P. A. Bergeret is about to construct, after
plans by Architect i. Goddard, a three-story
and basement frame building at the corner of
Hollis and O'Farrell streets. It will cost
$10,000.
Work on the new Center Market building,
fronting on Powell and O'Farrell streets, is
progies sing rapidly and it is expected that it
will be ready for occupancy in the course of a
month or six weeks.
A new building is to be erected by Drs.
Thorne and Robinson on the south side of But
ter street, between Leavenworth and Hyde, ad
joining the residence of General Barnes. It is
to be used exclusively for phyacians and
dentists' offices. Plans are now being pre
pared by J. Lyon.
Baldwin &. Hammond have been appointed
agents for the Donohoe building, which is
being thoroughly renovated. They have also
been given the management of the Columbian
building where there are at present a number
of choice office rooms for rent.
A. M. Speck & Co. report that their August
business was very satisfactory, and in an in
terview A. M. Speck said : "Our business Is so
much improved that we feel very hopeful for
an early revival in the real estate market. We
find that the inquiries for good iovestments
both large and small are greater than at any
time this year. Improved income-paying
property yielding 6 per rent or more on" the
amount invested is found to be a safer ana
more desirable way of investing money than
placing it in savings banks where the
in terest on deposits averages only about 4 per
cent."
Hanged for the Murder of Jttia Friend
ATLANTA, Ga., Sept. 6. â Arthur
Hayne, a white man, 26 years old, was
hanged here Friday for the murder of
Will Spinks. The two had been bosom
friends, and eigtit years ago they were im
plicated in the murder of an Italian.
Spinks' testimony caved Hayne. Last
winter the two friends quarreled and
Hayne killed Spinks.

WILLCUTT WILL LIE LOW
He Will Not Acknowledge the
Railroad Commissioners'
Jurisdiction.
Application Will Probably Be Made
to the Supreme Court for a
Writ of Mandate.
It is the purpose of the Market-street
Railway Company to deny the jurisdic
tion of the Railroad Commission over
street railways in general and the lines of
the Market-street Railway Company in
particular, and its intent will be made
manifest in an official way to-day at the
meeting of the Railroad Commission.
Some months ago the Ash Dury Heights
ImDrovement Club petitioned the Board
of Railroad Commissioners to investigate
the earnings of the Market-strtet Railway
Company, and to reduce the 6-cent fare
to 3 cents, or 2% cents, if the results of the
investigation of the affairs of the company
warranted such action.
In compliance with this petition, and
after aue consultation with Attorney-
General Fitzgerald, a subpenawas issued
and served on Secretary J. L. Willcutt as
follows:
We command you, that all and singly, busi
ness and excuses being set aside, you appear
and attend before said board, at the office
thereof, rooms 27 and 28, Chronicle building,
on the corner of Market and Kearny streets,
in the City and County of San Francisco,
State of California, on Monday, Septem
ber 7, A. D. 1896, at the hour ot 1 o'clock
p. M. of said day, and that you bring with you
and produce to said board auy and all books,
records and papers of lhe Market-street Rail
way Company, a corporation organized and
existing under and by virtue of the laws of
the Siate of California, and having its princi
pal place of business at the City and County of
San Francisco, State of California, showing the
following matters or either or any of them
pertaining to the business, property and
affairs of said Market-street Railway Com
pany, viz:
Capital stock paid in as common and capital
stock actually paid in as preterred.
Funded debt and floating debt.
Total gross deot and construction accounts,
as well as improvement accounts.
AH other assets.
Total property and assets.
Receipts from transportation of passengers.
Receipts from all other sources.
Total receipts.
Operating expenses.
Interest paid within the year.
Taxes paid within the year.
Salaries and wages.
All other expenditures.
Total expenditures.
Rate and amounts of dividends paid.
Surplus.
â  Expenditure for new rolling stock.
Expenditures for repairs of rolling stock.
Total number of passengers Carried during
the year.
To'.al number of horses.
Total numcer of cable cars.
Total number of electric motor care.
Total number of other cars.
Total length of roads operated in miles.
Average number of persons employed.
Average rate of fare per passenger.
You are to testily in the above-stated matter
now pending in said board, and for a failure
to attend and produce said books, papers and
records you will be deemed guilty oi con
tempt of this board and liable to punishment
thereof.
What the action of the railway company
is to be has been a matter of much and in
teresting speculation among every one in
terested in the reduction of car fares, and
more particularly among attorneys and
others interested in the legal issues that
are likely to be raised.
It was feared by some that the Market-
Btreet Railway Company, following the
precedent of the Southern Pacific Com
pany in tue case recently tried before Cir
cuit Judge McKenna, "would raise the
question of the constitutionality of the
commission, but it was learned from a re
liable source yesterday that the right, of
the commission would only be btought
into question so far as it 9 jurisdiction over
street railways is concerned.
Secretary Willcutt will be represented be
fore the commission by one of the regular
attorneys of tne company, but none of
the books and documents mentioned in
the subpena will be forthcoming despite
the reading of the subpena to the effect
that a failure to comply will be deemed
contempt of the board.
According to the constitutional provi
sions creating the commission the board
has the right to punish for contempt.
It is not tne intention, however, to re
sort to this power, as the purpose is to
determine the issues at stake and not
simply to annoy and harass the railway
company. A writ of mandate will be ap
plied for to the Supreme Court, and the
matter thus brought to a fair legal test of
the power of the Commission in this re
spect.
PATRIOTIC CHILDREN.
Meeting of the Valentine Holt Society
of Revolutionary Â£>eÃcendants.
A meeting of the Valentine Holt So
ciety of the Children of the Ameri
can Revolution was held last Sat
urday afternoon in the public parlor
of tne Occidental Hotel, which had
been placed at the disposal of the society
through the courteÃy of Major William B.
Hooper. Not only was the use of the par
lor given for tde purpose, but the major
had the meeting place handsomely decor
ated with American flags.
The patriotic quotations, with which
each member is supposed to respond to
roll call, were of an unusually interesting
character, many of tnem being taken from
Washington's farewell address, the one
hunaredth anniversary of which will fall
on the 19th inst.
Miss Flora Walton, the secretary, read a
letter from Miss Frances L Fairchild of
Cap Rouge, near Quebec, Canada, ac
knowledging the honor conferred upon
her and her sister by their election* to
honorary membership in the society, an
account of which was recently published
in The Call.
Miss Blanche Merry Dv Bois, daughter
of Pierre C. Dv Bois. and a descendant, of
Peter Dv Bois, Ralph Schenck and Enoch
Smith, revolutionary solaiers of the New
York line, were elected to membership.
During the afternoon David Hewes, one
of the State promoters of the society, in
vited the members to accompany him to
the dining-room, where dainty arid elegant
refreshments were servea.
The donation of a volume, entitled 'Our
Roll of Honor, or Poms of the Revolu
tion" for the society's library, was ac
knowledged.

THE PICTURE
OF A THOUGHT
Think of a Cat and the
Modern Camera Does
the Rest.
DR. D. S. JORDAN'S VIEWS
Stanford's President Starts an
Intellectual Tem
blor.
TALES AS WEIRD AS ALADDIN.
He Tells of Strange Experiments, and
Local Thinkers Open Their Eyes
in Wonder.
President David Starr Jordan of Stan
ford University has set scientists and the
thinking men of San Francisco to wonder
ing what has befallen him â all on account
of a strange monograph which appears
under his name in the "Popular Science
Monthly" for September.
The article, which shook up the thinkers
i the Pacific Union and Bohemian Clubs
us some temblor might shake the earth,
uears the stranee title, "The Sympsycho
praph: A Stuiiy of Impressionist Physics, "
and before one reads to the end he finds
the cold man of science, "the professor
of classified knowledge" as be has been
called, deaiiner. witn great sang froid, with
stories as remarkable as the tales of Alad
din, apparently giving credence to facts as
weird as anything ever told of adepts in
the occult, stories that tax the beleiving
powers of the ordinary layman of the
nineteenth century as much as the fable
of Acteoii, the celebrated hunter, who,
havine seen Diana bathing, was forthwith
chanced into a stag and hunted to death
by his own hounds.
Some of the members of the Pacific
Union Club became so exercised over the
strange revelations that they have written
to Alcalde for further details 01 what was
done.
The learned doctor of physics, psychics
and other forms oi knowledge simple and
occult, tells of the wonderful doings of
"The Astral Camera Club of Alcalde, or
ganized in November, 1895, for the pur
poses of scientific research through the
medium of photography." By long de
grees the club, says the professor, went
far beyond the experiments of Professor
Roentgen and the achievements of the
famous X ray, and got to a point where its
experts could photograph a cat, or any
such physical organism, without the pres
ence of the animals, the photograph being
transferred to the sensitive plate in some
strange manner by the exposure of the
plate to the intense gaze of a man who
had in his mind a clear mental picture of
the cat. In other words, under the latest
demonstrated theory, so Dr. David Starr
Jordan narrates, it is not necessary to
have a cat before a camera to obtain a cat's
photograph. All that the expert pho
tographer needs is a thinker who concen
trates his mind on some given physical
object, and the operator says to the
thinker who sits for a cat's photograph,
"You think of a cat and the camera does
the rest."
The 3age of Stanford brings the reader to
the story in its fullness by easy stages,
beginning as follows:
Ab soon as the news of the marvelous experi
ments of Professor Roentgen bad reached Al
calde, the Camera Club began work on the X
rays and on the larger problem of the signifi
cance oi photography without visible light.
They had no difficulty in repeating tne usual
exi>er:ments. They got an outline of ihe
skeleton 01 a canary, the shadow of an empty
pock-tbook, the bones of a linger surrounded
by a gold ring and the location of an imbedded
shot. Thus those stranKe rays of ligh-, or odic
force, Invisible to our eyes, because none of
our ancestors ever hud a chance to gaze upon
them, disclosed the presence of objects which
had eKe lain forever in darkness. In addition
to this, the green light of the vacmim lubes
provoked that uncanny feeling which always
precedes and presages a great discovery iv
occult science. From this feeling the club
was safe in predicting that far greater dis
coveries were to follow, and that the X ray*
â would not end in mere repetitions of Koent
gen's triumphs in "skiography."
In this they were not disappointed. Pro
fessor Inglis Ropers of London found that not
only could pictures be produced in darkness
by means of invisible force, but that the In
visible waves sent out through the ether by
the mind could also affect a sensitive plate,
.lust as one sensitive mind at a distance re
ceives an image sent out from the psychic
retinn of another, so could the same image be
concentrated and fixed upon a photographic
plate. Professor Rogers in a matter-of-fact way
looked for a few minutes at a postage-stamp,
then retired to a dark room and gazed through
ihe lens of the camera at the sensitive plate.
T.:e figure of the postage-stamp was on his
mind, and from his mind it passed out through
ihe sensitive ether to the plate made ready to
receive it. The result was a photograph of "the
.-tampâ small and a little blurred, Dut showing
the undonbted features of the gracious Queen
and ihe words "one penny." Thus was the
bridge between psychic power and photo
graphic sensitlvenes-i made once for all. This
connection established, there is naturally no
limit to the application of the principle.
From the foregoing experiment Dr. Jor
dan is able to conclude, by logical pro
cesses, that the principle is really not new,
and that some such marvelous powers
have been known to exist through all the
ages. He says:
It thus bocomes plain that the invisible rays
of Roentgen are not light in the common sense
but akin rather to the brain emanations, or
odic forces, which pass from mind to mind
without the intervention of forms of gross
matter as a medium, and to which gross mat
it r in all its forms is subject.
Nor is this principle new in the philosophy
of man. The wise of all ages have held that
mind is sovereign over matter. Besides this
general law it has been known to our fathers
that in the eye of the dying man is lmpi
the last scene on which he looked in life
With instruments of precision we may examine
that scene, and by skillful photography we
should be able to secure and fix it for all time
The achievement of the delicate task of
photographing a cat from a mental image,
as Dr. Jordan relates, does not belong
wholly to the California Club of Alcaide,
part of the fame belonging to English inv
estigators. who went beyond the experi
ment of photographing a stamp from a
mental image. Dr. Jorlan says:
It is therefore not necessary for this experi
ment that one should gaze at Â»>n individual
stamp. To thine of a stamp will serve as well.
Recognizing th is fact Cameron Lee, another
English experimenter, attempted to secure the

imaee of a thought. Placing his own eye in
the focus of a lens in absolute darkness he
thoueht intensely of the face of a certain cat.
After a long exposure, necessary on account of
the comparative grossness of the photographic
materials, a picturo was formed. The negative
shows a rounded outline, evidently tnat of the
enlarged pupil of the jjye, and in its center
w:i< formed a faint imaffe, which could be mis
taken lor nothing other than a cw, An ac
count of this experiment was given in the
daily press, but Its true bearing was first seen
nt Alcalde.
After the foregoing experiments became
generally known through the daily press,
Dr. Jordan says, Asa Marvin read a paper
on ti.ese discoveries, calling the Camera
Club's attention to their astral si^nifi
j cance and showing that they demon
strated, in a unique manner, the triumph
!of mind over mutter. The president of
Stanford then tells of the experiment, the
following being his report:
Haviug thus shown the broad principles on
which studies in the new psycho-ph.ys.ics must
rest, Mr. Marvin described a special contri
vance or application of these principles to the
work of the Camera Club.
He had devised a camera with a lens having
curved facets arranged on tne plan of the eye
01 ihe fly. To each one of the seven facets led
an insulated tube provided within by an elec
tric connection, so that electric or odic im
pulses could be transferred from the brain or
retina through the eye of each different ob
server to the many-faced lens. From the lens
these impulses would bo converged on a sensi
tive plate, as the rays of light are gathered to
! gether in ordinary photography.
From the members of the Camera Club seven
1 oi those having greatest animal magnetism
and greatest power of mental concentration
werecnosen for the experiment. Connection
wm mode from the eye oi these observers to
the corresponding parts of the lens; then ail
were to remain in utter darkness and perfect
silence, each person fixing his mind on a cat.
They were not to think of any particular cat,
| but ot a cat as represented by the innate idea
j of the mind or egi> itself. This was highly Im
portant, tor the purpose of Mr. Marvin was not
simply to fix by photography an ephemeral
recollection, as Mr. Rogers and Mr. Lee had
done: it was to bring out the impression of
ultimate feline reality. Ihe innate imnge in
the mind was the object desired. One man's
thought of a cat would be individual, ephe
meral, a recollection of seme cut which he had
! some lime seen, and which by the mind's eye
would be seen again. From seven idea 1 .?, sym
pathetically combined, the true cat would be
developed. This combination is the essence of
sympsychography, a term suggested by Pro
fessor Amos Gridiey of Alcalde, as distinct
from the ordinary ideography ol Roeers and
Lee. The personal equation would be meas
urably eliminated in synipsychography,
while the cat of the human innate idea, t lie
astral cat, the cat which "never was on sea or
land.' 1 but in accordance with which all cats
have been brought into incarnation, would be
more or less perfectly disclosed.
j In accordance with this plau the experiment
was tried under the direction of Asa Martin.
By the courtesy of the secretary of the club,
Miss Corintha Jones ot Alcalde.we are enabled
to present a copy of the resultant sympsycho
graph in advance of the publication of the
regular bulletin of the society in which the
apparatus used is figured In detail.
It will be noticed that this picture is unmis
takably one of a cat. But it is a cat in its real
essence, the type cat as distinguished from
human impressions of individual cats. This
achievement, like the earlier ones oi Odin,
Roentgen. Rogers and Lee, opens great vistas
for nuure scientific research. The next ex
-1 periment will be by similar means to photo
graph the cat's Idea of man.
As might be expected in a first attempt there
is a lack of co-ordination of the part?. Mr.
(iridley, the schoolmaster, had planned his cat
on a large scale, a huge cat tiice with gray,
radiant whiskers looking directly at the be
holder. Most of the others thought of the cat
in lateral view or profile. Tnese variant and
vagrant individual impressions nmuraliy ap
peared on the camera belore the other waves
were co-ordinaied and the reflex influences
came back from all to one, regulating and co
ordinating the thought of the cat. Thus the^e
[preliminary impressions are recorded as ghost
pictures in various places about the j late be
fore the ultimate composite view was achieved.
The delay in this regard has darkened the cen
ter picture, interfering a little with its perfec
tion of definition.
This darkening would probably appear in
other experiments on account of the long ex
posure (sixteen minutes) thought necessary
ior a picture of this kind.
On the cat's cheek is a curious black spot
or stigma which has not been fully accounted
for. From it* sharpness.of definition it must
stand in some relation to each of the seven
persons whose thoughts were centered upon
it. One suggestion was that this was the
blind spot on the retina in each of the sym
psychogrfcphers. But the blind spot marks
the poiut of entrance of the nerve which soes
back to the brain. While it may not have
visual power it is not unlikely that it is a
point of special activity in ideography. This
suggests that the black stigma may be the
yeilow spot, or tne macule lutea, the point of
acute vision, a region on the retina where
odic forces would naturally be absent. Mr.
Marvin himself inclines to the opinion that a
microscopic examination oi the negative will
The Thought-Picture of a Cat, of Which Professor Jordan Wrote for
the " Popular Science Monthly."
show that this stigma has likewise the form of
a cat and that it will be found to be an ideo
morphic germ, or centrum, where the co-or
dinate thought of the cat has nrst impinged
on the plate, and from which the image of the
cat has concentrically arisen.
Meanwhile the cat of Mr. Thompson, the
janitor, who alone could answer the question,
lay in the darkness under the warm stove and
purred softly.
The composite photograph which Presi
dent Jordan furnished the Popular Sci
ence Monthly appears with this article in
The Call. The whole experiment has at
tracted considerable attention in local
circles. Whether materialist, spiritualist
or theosophist, tne average thinker mar
vels, as well he may, at the strange reve
lations thus gravely announced by the
sage of Stanford.
The article of Dr. Jordon has been
widely read and commented on by men of
scientific attainments. The following in
terviews show their opinions.
Dr. Jerome Anderson, who is widely
known through his prominent position in
the Theosot)hical Society, regards the dis
covery as a clear advance in science and
also a corroboration ol the theosophical
theory. He said :
The experiments conducted by the Alcalde
Uub, as mentioned by Dr. Jordan in the Popu
lar science Monthly, in which the clubsuc
ceeded in producing the composite picture of
a cat, J look upon as a scientific confirmation
of theories long advanced by ibeoaophy. They
mean that the human mind hhs ihe power of
causing a finer form of rabet&aoc, technically
called by theosophlsts "astral matter, " to
assumeshape. All matter responds to thought
the human boly being an ever-present exam
ple of the power oi the minu over even coarse
physical matter, as it may be changed by
changing the mode of thought to a remark
able extent.
The image produced by the Alcalde Club
however, is in the astral matter alone referred
to, which is much more plastic than the ptiv
â ucal, and responds almost instantaneously to
thought. \ n>rati.Â»n throughout the universe
is continuous, and where vision disappears at
the violet end of the spectrum chemical ac
tion is most BC.ivo, showing that force is sf 1
.iciing in matter, oi.ly the human eve is in
capab.e oi perceiving it. Witbin ihe "domain
ol :!iis chemical portion oi the spectrum and
above :he point where ordinary vision ceases
ie many possibilities which the future scient
iat must .iucover and every oi:e of which will
conlirm the assertion of the iheosopnist of the
existence of this astral matter and the relation
it bear* to the human body.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1896.
PROFESSOR DAVID STARR JORDAN, Whose Remarkable
Paper on "What He Terms "The Sympsycho graph" Has Greatly
Interested Local Scientists, Whose Credulity Will Be in Suspense
Until the Scientist Returns From Alaska.
The very lowest astral matter merges
directly into the highest physical. There are
no breaks in nature. The Jellyfish is an ex
ample of almost pure astral substance. The
visions we see in dreams are the creations of
our thoughts outof this same astral substance,
and remain just so long as the dreaming im
agination holds them intact â and they may
one day be photographed. The materializa
tions of mediums are only concentrations of
the same astral matter down so close to the
physical that they can be plainly seen by the
naked eye and of course could be easily photo
graphed.
That which the Alcalde Club has accom
plished through the power of their united
wills has been tbe condensatiou of an imuge
formed by thought in the astral matter and
brought within the range of those chemical
rays, to which the photographic plate re
sponds and precipitated upon it. Astrono
mers, as Professor Jordan well knows, nave
succeeded in photographing millions of stars
invisible to the naked eye, simply because the
sensitized plate records these higher vibra
tions.
Thought has not been photographed, nor
will ii ever be, but the form which the thought
undoubtedly produces in tne astral matter
has been in this und mimy other instances.
Such experiments are most useful, because
they all tend to break down that materialistic
conception of the universe which even science
itself has been at so much pains to solve.
Between the point where the ear no longer
recognizes vibrations as sound and the point
where those same vibrations reappear as light
there lies a great hiatus for the human mind
to explore. Every portion of it is unquestion
ably discoverable. Whether this will be done
by scientific instruments of precision, or, as
theosophy claims, by the evolution of more
perfect or new sense faculties, cuts little fig
ure. Every one who has developed to the
slightest degree his psychic has entered it.
Every scientist who invents an instrument
capable of detecting and recording these
higher vibrations has also entered it and both
ought to be co-workers in this unknown field
of future possibilities. All such experiments,
therefore, are to be welcomed, and by the
theosophist they are, for they are the direct
scientific proof of his theories. That these ex
periments have attracted the attention of a
scientist of Dr. Jor<lnn's worlds-wide reputation
is a fact for which humanity may be grateful.
It removes sucti things entirely from the do
main of superstition and charlatanry, to
which scientists have heretofore been only too
prone to relegate them. When such men take
hold of them they undoubtedly receive that
intelligent scrutiny and accuracy of observa
tion to which theii importance entitles them.
Dr. W. W. Gamble, the theosophical
lecturer and writer, said:
This is merely a confirmation of what the
osophists have long known and taught. It is
highly important, however, to the Western
world, and coming from the source it does it
should carry great weight. These experiments
are corroborative of those recently made by
Dr. Baradue in Paris and explained at some
length a few weeluC tinea in The Sunday Call.
It is a scientific demonstration of the astral
plane, and Dr. Jordan himself recognizes that.
From the way in which it was done I should
say they did actually succeed in photograph
ing thoughtâ niMtt-rialized thought. We claim
that the whole universe is mereiy materialized
thought, that man is actually surrounded and
lives in his own thought, peoples the space
nround him with the images of his own crea
tion.
The universe is ail built up of thought.
Thoughts are often a long while in becoming
objeciionized on this plane. Our after death
life is actually a contemplation of those
thoughts we have created. We see, aiter
d'.-sth, the actual process by which these
thoughts of ours arc formed into astral pict
un â >. Every thought we have is actually
photographed in the nstral lightâ that plastic
body surrounding and interpenetrating the
world and known to the scientist as ether.
This is the preat negative plate of nature
spoken of in Dr. Jordan's article. It receives
all the impressions of thought.
From that negative plate of nature these
thought* are in time developed into ma
terial objec;s. Of course those objects take
various forms; some are built up as plants, us
trees; others as animals, and, in fact, the
whole earth itself is built up of the thoughts
of men. What we call the astral light is really
nature's great workshop.
Thoughts are real things and there should
bn nothing very strange in the discovery that
they can be photographed. Not only do we
form images of all that surround us, by our
thoughts, live as it were among our thoughtx,
but man actually creates the model of his own
body, around which the physical cells are
formed, just as an architect forms the model
upon which his building is erected. We look
around fia;i Francisco and see the whole
nature of the landscape i-hntiged by the archi
tectural structures create! by the thoughts of
men, and in this way, on other planes, in fact,
does man surround himself with the creations
of his own thought.
Professor George Davidson, looking at
the discovery as related by Dr. Jordan
from the point of view of a strictly scien
tific man, felt inclined to doubt it. Still
he would not enter into a critical discus
sion of Dr. Jordan's article in the Popular
Science Monthly because he had not read
it. He said :
â¢ Until I have read the whole thing and dis
cussed it in my own mind I won't give an opin
ion on this subject. At present my judgment
is adverse from what I have heard of it. With
what little evidence I hÂ»ve I don't believe it,
and the odic force that has been revamped.
This thing was brought to my notice by Mr.
Jones, engineer of the gas works, who read the
article of Dr. Jordan, ihe odic force business
was brought up thirty years ago as one of
those mysterious things that could not be ac
counted for, and it was dropped. In fact it
was never accepted by scieniihc men. It was
one of those things that are shoved before the
public to account for all unexplained phe- |
nomena and never accepted, so it died a nat- |
ural death. If this thing were accounted fur i
by reliable men I would accept It, but as I un- |
demand it there is no satisfactory authotity
quoted. I must read this article, but so far I
don't believe it.
Eduard C. Jones, engineer of the gas
company, is a gentleman of scientific
leanings, who has been making experi
ments with the X ray. The result of his
experiments formed the theme of a paper
read last week oefore the Technical So
ciety. His interest in the mysterious rays :
led him to give the article of Dr. Jordan
more than ordinary thought. In speak
ing of it he said:
I'm afraid it is a hoax. My Idea of the pic
ture is that it is a composite photograph of
several cats, with the negatives blurred over
ior effect. Thai is how I regard the wonderful
picture that Dr. Jordan says was made by men
looking at a camera in a "dark room. It is a
f>lty that i-uch an article should have appeared
nthe Popular Science Monthly instead of in
Puck. However I'm not prepared to say that
it is a hoax, although some one may have been
imposed upon.
The scientists at the State Universltv are
much interested in the wonderful results
recently attaincl by the use of the sym
psychograph. While none have studied it
to any extent, as yet, still they are hope
ful that the wonderful invention will
prove to be all that is claimed for it.
Professors Harrison, Slate, Reiter and
Cory were interviewed yesterday with re
gard to the invention and all expressed
their interest in it.
None of them having studied the sym
psychoirraph they were not prepared to go
into details regarding its practicability,
but all were agreed that should the new
invention do all that is claimed for it a
great step In advancement will
have been made.
T. B. Wilson, who has given the subject
some serious consiaeration, when as tied
hia views upon it, said that he had ex
pressed himself in relation to the matter
in a paper read before a society in this
City a short time since and the substance
of what he said then is as follows:
The digestive processes of the mind are not
so much unlike those of the body as one might
suppose. The digestive organs of ih*body are
stimulated to heahhy action by proper food;
so is tfte mind stimulated to healthy action by
proper thoughts. Thoughts are things.
Thoughts are as substantial and material in
their realm as a bar of iron is substantial and
material in its realm. Nor do thoughts origi
nate to die in the mind. They are line seeds
of the vegetable kingdom which are carried
hither and thither by air currents to and lodg
ment in rich soil in fallow ground or upon
beds of rocks. Thoughts are projected from
the mind into the astral world and upon wings
oi ether currents they rush away to be dissi
pated or to find sympathetic entertainment in
the mental realm. We arc not only our.-elves
advanced or retnrded in our spiritual unfold
meni as our thoughts are pure or impure, but
are responsble, in some degree at least, for
the harvest they bring to others wnen they
find lodgment in the mind of others.
To illustrate: Suppose you allow yourself to
become so angry at some one thai you would
have pleasure in giving him a sound thrash
ing. Let us follow the current which you
have laden with angry thoughts until you "de
posit its burden on the mind of one who is still
more deeply agitated from anger. Let us follow
his thoughts, now re-en forcd by your own,
to the mind of one who is bent upon murder,
but who lacks thought-strength to commit
the act. He hesitates until his mind is stimu
lated to action by the inrush of the combined
angry thoughts of your own and those of the
eecund mind, when he commits tne deed.
What relation would you sustain to the crime?
Wculd you not be morally a participant in the
murder? and would you not gather spiritual
thorns and thistles from that sowing of angry
thoughts? Whatsoever a man soweth that
shall he also reap. Epidemics ot crime are
the harvest of angry thoughts rushing in upon
a common center.
Lynching, rioting and other similar demon
strations of mental activity are the outcome
of inrushing angry thoughts. Who has not
seen a gathering of merry-makers plunged in a
twinkling from the lofty thoughts of peace,
good- will and jo down to the black pit of foui
hatred and murderous desire 7
when our thoughts are spotted with desires
that are not the loftiest nor the purest, th .
may find lodgment In feitile minds and dis
courage purpose to reform, if there be such
purpose, and encourage to greater degrada
tion if that desire predominates. Thoughts
may be made powerful lorces for evil and for
good.
Of course, thoughts may be photographed.
President Jordan will return from Alaska
about October Ist, and it is believed he
will be able to throw considerable light on
the question when he arrives. During his
absence scientists and iheosophists alike
will be in painful suspense.

The socialists will not take part in the
Labor day festivities. They declare that
their time for celebrating is May 1. and
under no circumstances would they vary
from the European custom, for it is in the
Old World that "Labor Day," as under
stood by them, is correctly intepreted.
In spite of tdis diversion, bowever, Labor

Tne socialist?, under the leadership of
Charles D. Sunflower, h^ld a public meet
ing at the corner of Market street and
Grant avenue yesterday afternoon. The
police made no attempt to break up the
meeting, although a crowd of several
hundred blocked the street: Sunflower
made one of his characteristic speeches
and was followed by James Andrew, labor
candidate for Lieutenant-Governor. The
latter pointed out the evils of the present
Government as viewed by the party he
represented, laying particular stress on
the fact that in tbe Socialist Labor party
none of these condition existed.
Last night at Pythian Hall on Market
street the regular weeidy meeting was
held. The chairman of the evening was
T. T. Anthony, who made a few brief re
marks fitting to tbe occasion. G. B. Ben
ham and G. Aspden gave appropriate
readings, after which the speaker of the
evening, E. T. Kingsley, was introduced.
This gentleman, it may be remarked, is
tne Socialists' Labor party candidate for
Congress from the Fourth District.
The speaker selected for hi 9 subject
"Confusion." In a direct and general
way he criticized the attitude of the two
old parties, claiming that they were con
fusing in their arguments and that neither
really benefited the workingman. He
referred incideutally to the fact that the
socialist labor party was already organiz-d
in seventeen States and he expected to
see every State in the Union fall into line
before November. There were tens of
thousands, he said, who would cast their
votes forMatchettand Maguire, the Social
ist labor party candidates for President
and Vice-President.
The campaign committee of the Social
ist labor party is extremely active at pres
ent. They hays the full legal number re
quired to get their candidates on the mu
nicipal ticket, and the same is true of the
Fourth Congressional District. The State
ticket, however, is not faring so well. As
twenty days yet remain before returns
must be made, the campaign committee
believe the full 3000 signatures will be ob
tained.
During the ooming week J. F. Foues,
prominent in Oakland political circles,
will leave on a novel electioneenngtour of
Northern California. He proposes to tour
that end of the State in a wagon, deliver
ing lectures where he thinks they will do
the most good and scattering socialist
literature with a lavish hand. James
Andrews of Berkeley will leave on a simi
lar mission next week.
LIVED FOR CHARITY.
Rev. Edward P. I>emp*ey Speaks of the
Good Work of Saint Vincent
de Paul.
Rev. Edward P. Dempsey delivered a
discourse last evening at the conclusion
of vespers upon the iife and labors of St.
Vincent de Paul. The subject of the ser
mon was a priest of the seventeenth cen
tury, who devoted his entire life to the
alleviation of human suffering. Through
his labors numerous asylums, homes fur
the aged and other charitable institutions
were founded throughout France. He also
instituted the order of the Sisters of
Charity, whose ministrations to-day re
lieve the poor and the suffering in every
land.
Tne Saint Vincent de Paul Society, a
large branch of which exists in this City,
is devoted to the charities advocated by
its patron and Father Dempsey made
an earnest appeal to the members of the
Cathedral congregation to become con
tributing members of this society.
"You who aresurrounded by everything
you need," he saui, "know nothing of
these people who are so poor â but they
exist in the parish.
"The charity of this kind is the kind
that the Almighty God wants of us. The
charity that does something practical for
the poor is the charity of Christ. Would
that the spirit of St. Vincent would find
an active, zealous place in every member
here. Remember, the Scriptures from
beginning to end are tilled with promises
to those who follow the practices of which
M. Vincent de Paul is an exemplar. Re
member that even a class of water given
in his name will not be unrewarded. We
will never miss it. Remember, we are
brothers and sisters of tbe same God."

The Knights of the Red Branch Rifles will

tne picnic will be devoted to the released Irish-
Americans who have been confined in England
