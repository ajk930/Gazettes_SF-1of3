STAYS OFF
THE STUMP,
Major McKinley Will Not
Make any Pyrotechnic
Displays.
BRIGHT OUTLOOK IN THE
FAR WEST.
Mark Hanna Tells of the Great
Campaign Work Directed
From Chicago.
LEADERS OF THE PARTY ARE
CERTAIN OF SUCCESS.
From Many Sections Come Reports
That the Republicans Will Carry
the Country.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 17.â Major
McKinley and M. A. Hanna were in con
ference at Mr. Hanna's home all day Sun
day. Said Mr. Haina this morning:
"The outlook throughout the Western
States is more promising than two weeks
ago, and I construe it as eveidence that
the campaign of education is beginning to
tell. I have the Chicago headquarters
thoroughly organized and up to Satur
day last had scattered fifteen thou
sand campaign documents in every
section of the country. This is a mere
handful compared to what will be sent
out. There is a healthy and growing
demand for Republican literature, which,
in my opinion, demonstrates that the
people want reliable information and are
coming to Chicago headquarters to get it.
Within a week or ten days we will begin
to shoot off our oratorical artillery. It
will come in good season, as the people
will have then had time to digest some of
the campaign literature.
"It has been given out that McKinley
will not take the stump, and nothing has
occurred to cause him to deviate from
the original decision. To settle the mat
ter, once and for ail, McKiniey will not
take the stump. Neither will he address
the G. A. R. gathering at Milwaukee. At
present I cannot justly size up the Eastern
situation. I will be on the ground Tues
day. All that I will say of Mr. Bryan's
speech is that it was a skimmer. The last
member of the executive committee has
not yet been appointed, and the matter is
still in abeyance.
"It is all twaddle about my going to
Newport for the summer. I want the
press to state emphatically that L am not
going to Newport. It will take all of my
time to look after the campaign. Ido not
see why the public should be interested in
the doings of my family."

NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 17.â Mayor
H. E. Pingree of Detroit, Mich., who has
been nominated for the governorship, ar
rived in New York to-day and is a guest
at the Murray Hill Hotel. He expressed
himself as confident that both the National
and State Republican tickets would be
successful in Michigan.
Senator J. B. Fo raker arrived at the
Fifth-avenue Hotel to-day. He will sail
for Europe next Wednesday to meet his
daughters,, who are now in London. He
expects to return by the middle of Sep
tember and to make speeches before the
campaign closes. To a reporter he said he
had no fears about Ohio.
"The people in Ohio are not silver crazy
and they will stand by the Republican
party and sound money," he said. "Where
one Republican is converted to free silver
at least a hundred Democrats declare for
McKinlev and sound money. That shows
the drift out West."
"How about the silver feeiing outside of
Ohio in the so-called doubtful Middle
States?"
"I believe there is no doubt about their
going for McKinley and sound money."
General John W. Foster, ex-Secretary of
State, also arrived to-day. He went out
early and was in conference with promi
next Republicans.
Ex-Congressman F. G. Niedringhans of
Missouri, who was at the Waldorf Hotel,
said a great many Democrats in St. Louis
had openly repudiated the Bryan ticket.
As to the State he thought it debatable
ground and that the Republicans stood a
splendid chance to win.
ALLISON IS SANGUINE
lowa Will Certainly Swing Into the Re-
publican Column.
CHICAGO, 111., Auk. 17.â Senator Al
lison came to Republican headquarters
to-doy from the seashore prepared to take
an active part in the campaign in his
home State and elsewhere. Senator Bur
rows arrived from his Michigan home on
a similar mission, having been assigned
to speak at the opening of the Illinois
campaign in. Jacksonville this week. He
has already made one speech in Indiana,
and after this week he will devote two
weeks to addressing the electors of his
State. The. regular opening of the Michi
gan campaign by the State committee will
be about Saptember 10. Senator Allison
said he would not do much campaign
work outside of lowa and added:
"I shall be very much surprised if we
fail to carry lowa. The general situation
is favorable, but there is hard work abead
to make sure of victory. Ido not antici
pate much difficulty on account of fusion
in lowa. Fusion between Democrats and
Populists is no novelty with us, but their
united strength has not been enough to
wrest the Siate from the Republicans.
There have been some Republicans led
astray by free silver, but there are also
many lowa Democrats who will vote for
for McKinley against the fusion ticket.
Hard work will convert these backsliders
and I am going to help to do it."
Senator Burrows said the free-silver
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
strength in Michigan was concentrated in
the places where green backism reigned,
and he had much difficulty in getting an
admission from prominent Republicans
that free silver was gaining ground in any
locality. He was always referred to some
other place, and that other place denied
the allegation. He predicted that there
would be 50,000 majority for McKinley.
Mr. Hepburn of lowa came in to tell the
committeemen that their literature and
speakers were driving t c silver sentiment
among Republicans to small proportions.
SURE TO CARRY NEW YORK.
General Wood ford Carrie* Good Sews to
Major McKinley.
CAM TON, Ohio, August 17.â Major Mc-
Kinley returned from Cleveland at 1
o'clock this afternoon. To-morrow at 11
o'clock several hundred colored citizens
of Cleveland will call on Major McKinley.
They will come from the Forest City by
special train with a band, and the Major
is expected to make a speech.
More telegrams were received to-day
announcing the formation of McKinley
clubs.
General and Mrs. Stuart L. Woodford
arrived in Canton to-night and spent the
evening at the McKinley residence. Gen
eral Woodford discussed at length the sit
uation in New York with Mr. McKinley.
General Woodtord said that the Republi
cans are certain to carry New York, and
he thinks the Republican National ticket
will have between 100,000 and and 200,000
plurality. He estimates the sound-money
vote at 750,000. j'- . ; â 
FOUR KILLED, FIFTEEN WOUNDED.
An Old Feud Leads to a Furious and Fatal
Battle at a Kentucky Baptist
Meeting.
LOUISVILLE, Kt., Aug. 17.â Four men
were killed and abont fifteen wounded in
an encounter in a remote settlement of
Elliott County on Sunday. The fight was
between the Whites and Herefords, be
tween whom an old feud existed. It oc
curred at a Baptist association which a
number of each family were attending,
and it said the affair was premeditated.
The fight was started by one party
striking another one of the other side
across the back with a light switch. The
latter declared that a repetition of
the act would cost the former his life. He
was struck azain with the switch and the
fight began. Pistols, knives, rocks and
clubs were used with terrible effect. Two
of those killed were shot and the other
two killed with knives. Several of the
wounded are fatally hurt.
While these were lying on the ground
writhing the uninjured members of the
victorious gang kept quiet and prevented
aid being rendered. AH this time they
were riding around swearing that the
wounded must be allowed to die and that
the sooner they died the better looking
corpses they would make.
The Whites are a numerous and fighting
family, and it is expected that they will
attempt to annihilate the Herefords.
DYNAMITE'S FATAL WORK
Three Men Killed and Three
Mortally Wounded by an
Explosion.
Telephone Workmen Starting on a
Blasting Expedition Were the
Victims.
LANCASTER, Pa., Aug. 17.â A fright
ful accident took place this morning in
the borough of New Holland, thirteen
miles east of this city, by which three per
sons were killed, three fatally injured,
fully a score of persons badly hurt and
much damage done to property.
A party of men employed by the Penn
sylvania Telephone Company was on the
point of starting out to do some work in
the neighborhood of the town. For blast
ing purposes they had taken out 100
pounds of dynamite, which bad b*en
piaced in a wagon with the tools they ex
pected to use. The wagon was standing
in the yard of Miller's Hotel preparatory
to the start. Several of the men were en
gaged in loading it and other members of
the party, together with a number of
idlers, stood around looking at the work
i-n progress.
All of a sudden, and wholly without
warning, a terrific explosion took place.
The men working around the wagon and
those who were near by looking on were
thrown in all directions. C. Cannon of
Reading, one of the men at the wagon, was
blown to pieces, and fragments of his body
were afterward found far from the scene of
the explosion. F. Hammond of Harris
burg, another of the employes of the tele
phone company, was instantly killed. He
leaves a wife and two children. George
Crossman of Steelton, a water boy, was
frightfully hurt. He died while being
taken to the hospital.
Of the other men three were so badly
injured that there is little, if any, hope
oi saving them. Fully a score of the
onlookers received injuries more or less
serious.
The explosion was so violent that the
whole town was shaken and considerable
damage done to slass. Miller's Hotel was
badly wrecked. The loss in that building
is estimated to be over $5000.
How the explosion occurred is not
known, as the only ones who conld throw
any light on the subject were instantly
killed.
BURGLARS RAID A HOTEL.
Five Masked Men Blow Up the Safe and
intimidate the Guests of the
Resort.
BRIDGEPORT, Conu., Aug. 17. -The
Beach Side Inn, a fashionable hotel at
Green's farms, was robbed by five masked
burglars early this morning. The thieves
secured about $1800 in cash ana $1000 in
checks, which had been left in the office
safe. Patrick Hartigan, the watchman,
tells a story not very satisfactory to the
police. He says he was surrounded by
five or six men on the beach in front of
the hotel about 12 o'clock. They bound
and gagged him and carried him to the
veranda. There they procured from him
the key to the office and entered.
A heavy charge of dynamite was placed
in a hole drilled in the safe, and the ex
plosion which followed shook the house.
The 102 guests, nearly all from New Yorfc,
sprang from their beds, but Mrs. Harry B.
SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, AUGUST 18, 3 896.
None So Blind as Those Who Won't See.
Smith of New York, the first to appear,
was met by a masked robber, who pointed
a pistol at her head and told her to return
to her room. She did so. The other
guests were met with a similar command,
and they also obeyed. The robbers cut
the telephone wires leading from the
place and were nowhere to be found when
the police of this city were put on their
track.
WHY THE WORKS CLOSED.
Unsettled Business Caused Employes of the
Colorado Iron Gompany to Lose
Employment
DENVER, Colo., Aug. 17.â President J.
C. Osgood of the Colorado Fuel and Iron
Company, in a card to the local press rela
tive to the closing of the Bessemer Steel
Works at Pueblo, says:
â¢'All railroad orders are filled, and the
present unsettled business and financial
business of the country prevents us from
buying rails for renewals, and all new en
terprises are held in abeyance. All the
other departments of the company's works
at Bessemer are in operation and will be
continued so long as we can find a market
for the products. Whenever new rail
orders can be had work will be resumed at
the iron mines and blast furnaces. This
action was taken without consultation
with or suggestion from the directors or
stockholders."
Mr. Osgood places the number of men
thrown out at the mine at 150 and 146 at
the blast furnaces.
Caved in on Workmen.
EAU CLAIRE, Wis., Aug. 17.â For the
past two weeks the Music Hall block, the
principal business block in this city, has
been undergoing a remodeling. This after
noon at 4 :3o o'clock the building caved in
while a large num ber of men were at work.
One man, Halvor Oleson, was taken from
the ruins dead and fifteen others seriously
injured. William Dean, an officer of the
Pnoenix Manufacturing Company, and
Nicholas Roach, an employe, are buried
in the ruins and are supposed to be dead,
as well as a number of other employes of
contracting firms.

To the Democrats of the United States: The
Democratic ! party ] Is the only, political party
with a history dating ] back â  to . the history of
the â  Republic. [ Party , after party ; has had ; its
overthrow. Some â  have â¢ achieved temporary
triumphs. With each triumph' was heard the
prophecy â¢ that - the â  Democratic party would
surely die. It has survived all defeats. By
virtue of its indestructible principles it has
witnessed the birth and death of every rival
save one, and this, its present great antago
nist, with a history of not more than forty
years, has no part in laying the foundations of
constitutional popular government.
For more than a century men of high posi
tion, of noble ambition, of unselfish and pa
triotic aims, have adhered to the Democratic
party with a constancy of devotion unparal
leled in the history of politics. For more than
a century, through good and evil report, in
times of prosperity and days of adversity, It
has kept its faith. "Without variableness or
shadow of turning," it has held fast to the
fundamental principles of free government,
lormulated by its founders, and subsequently
enforced by its great leaders, from Jefferson
to Cleveland. For more ihan a century no
man was ever in doubt as to what constituted
Democracy. He who proclaimed himself a
Democrat defined his principles. He believed,
and this was the cardinal article of his politi
cal faith, in the ability of every individual,
unassisted, if unfettered by law, to achieve his
own happiness; and therefore, that to every
citizen there should be secured the right and
opportunity peaceably to pursue whatever
course of conduct he would, provided such
conduct deprived no other Individual of the
equal enjoyment of the same right and oppor
tunity. He stood for freedom of speech, Iree
dom of conscience, freedom of trade and free
dom of contract, all of which are implied by
the century-old battle cry of the Democratic
party, "Individual Liberty." As a conse
quence, every Democrat believed In the rule of
the law aud the rule of an impartial law, in
the unhesitating protection not only of the
lives of citizens, but of private rights and prop
erty and in the enforcement of obedience to
duly constituted aothority.
Every true Democrat insisted upon a strict
observance of the mandates of the Federal
constitution and of the limitations therein pre
scribed, as well as upon a loyal support of all
the institutions thereby created to be guar
antees of the liberty it sought to perpetuate.
He profoundly disbelieved in the ability of
the Government, through paternal legislation
or supervision, to increase the happiness of
the Nation. He was opposed to all attempts
to conjure comfort into the homes of its citi
zens or wealth into their pockets. He believed
that it is the function of the Government to
provide the people with an honest and stable
medium of exchange, thus enabling them to
transact their business safely and conveniently
in every mart and market of the world.
He repudiated every attempt to supply to
money by means of legislation that value
which it can possess only by reason of those
qualities that render it acceptable to the
world when unsupported by legislative fiat.
He believed in the greatest measure of free
dom of trade and industry compatible with
the necessity to obtein by constitutional
means an adequate revenue for the support
of the Government. He believed in a simple,
economical, honest and efficient administra
tion of the affairs of the Nation, to the end
that the prime object of government and lib
erty of the people should be preserved with
the least possible burden and the greaiest
possible certainty.
With such a record and such a creed, the
President, moreover, being a Democrat re
elected on a platform reaffirming the sound
principles of Democracy, the Democratic party
was called upon to select delegates to a Na
tional Convention. The delegates to the con
vention held at Chicago were authorized and
had tne power to proclaim a platform embody
ing their views of the true solution of the
particular problems of government now agi
tating the Nation, but upon the condition that
such platform should be consistent with the
cardinal principles held by the party through
out its existence. These principles constitute
the essential element of the party's life. They
distinguish it from all other political organi
zations. If they are abandoned the party
ceases to exist. It was, therefore, not within
the power of any majority of the delegates as
sembled at Chicago to bind the Democrats of
the United States to a platform inconsistent
with the party's principles or to any action
that should result in their surrender.
In violation of the trust committed to them
a majority of the delegates assembled in that
convention, ignoring the rights of the minor
ity, unseated regularly elected delegates to
make places for others in sympathy with
themselves. They proclaimed a sectional
combination of the South and West against
the North and East. They impeached the
honesty and patriotism of President Cleve
land, who, under exceptional embarrassments
produced by past errors of legislation, has
heroically maintained the honor and integrity
of the Republic. Against the protest of one
third of the delegates they promulgated a
platform at variance with the essential princi
ples of the Democratic party.
This platform is in its policies dangerous to
the welfare and life of free government. It is
mischievous in its tendencies. But even more
threatening and mischievous was the spirit of
the convention that adopted it, a spirit mani
fested not alone by its affirmative action, but
as well by its reckless rejection of every propo
sition tending to temper the declaration of the
convention with conservatism and justice.
The platform proposes to degrade the coin of
the United States by means of the free, un
limited and independent coinage of silver by
our Government, and by the exercise of the
power of the Nation to compel the acceptance
of depreciated coins at their nominal value,
thereby working an injustice to creditors, de
frauding the laborer of a large part of his earn
ings and savings, robbing pensioned soldiers
of a part of their pensions, contracting the
currency by the expulsion of gold coin from

Native Sons and Daughters
Will TuA Out in Great
Numbers.
LIST OF THE EVENTS THAT ARE
SCHEDULED.
Those Who Have Arrangements in
Charge and What They Have
Accomplished.
STOCKTON, Cai., Aug. 17.â Stockton
is making every preparation for the
coming Admission day celebration. Last
year Sacramento entertained the Native
Sons royally, but the Mill City is not to
be outdone by her friendly rival, and no
pains will be spared to make the tnrea
days' festivities, on September. 8, 9 and 10,
the greatest ever held in the interior.
For weeks past committees have bean
hard at work arranging details of the
entertainment to be provided for the
visiting natives, and if varied amuse
ments count for anything the crowds that
come here nnxt month cannot fail to go
awny with a high opinion of the enter
prise of the Stocktonians and of the en
thusiasm with wnich the representatives
of the local parlor have entered into ihe
work of arranging for the celebration.
When telegrams were received here an
nouncing that Stockton had been selected
as the place for Holding the annual exer
cises the members of Stockton Parlor re
joiced greatly.
The joy felt that night has in no wise
abated and has made itseif felt in the
work of arranging for the three day 3' fes
tivities. The finance committee of the
parlor made a canvass of the city to insure
the success of the celebration and met
with liberal offers of aid from all the
people of the city. Merchants and me
chanics were equally liberal as their
means permitted, and it was not long be
fore the committee received enough prom
ises of assistance to make its members
sure of the success of the enterprise.
Stockton Parlor is composed of some of
the best known young men in the country
and there are few parlors in the State that
can boast of naving so many representa
tive members. W. B. Nutter who was
selected at the last Grand Parlor held in
San Luis Obispo, as the grand marshal
this year, is District Attorney of San
Joaquin County, and one of the coming
men in political and legal circles in Cali
fornia. For two terms he has been District
Attorney of this county, and in this office
his record is such that every member of
the order of Native Sons may well be
proud of him. He is the probable Demo
cratic nominee for Superior Judge, and
can secure the nomination for the asking.
He has taken first rank among the attor
neys of this section, and is a self-made
man.
Nutter bas appointed Frank Lane of
this city as his chief aid. Lane is almost
as well known in San Francisco as he is
here, for he is one of the largest dealers in
grain in this section. He is also one of
the leaders in society's Four Hundred
here. Other assistants who have already
accepted the appointment are Richard
Henderson of Sacramento, the grand mar
shal of last year, Charles Belshaw of Sac
ramento, and Eugene Bert, the San Fran
cisco attorney.
One of the first things that Stockton
Parlor did after it was known that the
Admission day celebration had been se
cured was to place the entire affair in the
hands of a general committee composed of
the representative young business men
who are members of the parlor. The com
mitteemen are: Orrin 8. Henderson, W.
T. Burres, Henry E. Adams, E. L. Carey,
L. H. Frankenheimer, Gus G. Grant, Otto
Grunsky, J. Marsh Ladd, C. E. Mantbey,
H. R. McNoble, W. C. Neumiller, R. A.
Reid, J. H. Sharon, George E. Wilhoit and
J. W. Willy.
The chief worK of preparing for the eelÂ«
ebration was, however, put in charge of
an executive committee composed of
Catts, Adams, Frankenheimer, Grunsky,
Neumiller, Henderson and Turner. Catta
was made chairman of the executive cora
mitlee, and Henderson, who is the young
est Republican member of the Board of
Supervisors of this county, was made
chairman of the general committee. J.
W. Willy, the deputy County Assessor,
was elected secretary of both committees,
and A. J. Turner made treasurer. Will
H. Kuowles of the Fire Department waa
elected assistant secretary, and ever since
has aided Willy, who has been the busi est
man in the parlor.
The chief aim of the general c ommit
tee has been to provide entertain
ment for the thousands of visitors who
â  will be here next month. To insure this,
the work was divided, and a number of
sub-committees have charge of it. Fea
tures were the main things, and features
the Natives have succeeded in arranging.
There will be no lack of amusement for
the crowds of visitors.
There will be a regatta on Stockton
Channel, such as has never Deen seen in
the State. This part of the programme is
in charge of Otto Grunsky, County Clerk
of San Joaquin County. The events will
be as follows: Senior and junior single
sculls; senior and junior barge races;
senior and junior out-rigger skiffs and a
launch race. The last event is rather
novel, inasmuch as it has not been at
tempted heretofore. Governor Budd has
assured The Call correspondent that he
i will offer a golden trophy of some kind fo<2
the launch race, and thie, it is expected,
â will brins the fastest craft from the bay
here for the event.
The Stockton crew of the Giants is in
training now for the senior barge event,
and hopes to secure the State champion
ship on the morning of the 9th of Septem
ber. The San Francisco crews are also in
training for the race, and it will be one of
the closest ever seen in California. The
Stockton men are determined to Merest the
championship from the heretofore victo
rious South End crew of San Francisco,
and are especially anxious to meet the
crackajacks of that City, as the Souta
enders and all others in the senior class
failed to come here on toe 4th of July to
compete against them. There will be no
lack of entries for this event, as all of the
San Francisco crews have signified their
intention of competing.
The senior single sculls are also exciting i
much interest. On July 4 Usiphssea bested
McCausland. who claimed the Pacinc
Coast championship. This year both will
have a bard battle to defeat A. G. lirown
of Stockton, who is in active training for
the sin les.
The regatta will attract thousands who
love aquatic 9ports, but this is cot all in
store for those who will line the banks of
Stockton Channel on;the morning of that
day. There will be an exhibition of high
diving by a Spaniard named Raoul, who,
two years aso, broke tne world's record
here by diving from a pile-driver eighty
six feet above the surface of the channel.
Grunsky has also the superintendence
of the grand ball in the pavilion, to be
given on the night of September 9, after
the water carnival. He has made arrange
ments with decorators to adorn the big
Agricultural parlor as it has never been
before. The decorations will remain in
place all during fair week in September.
The parade features are in charge of Dr.
W- I. Burres, and a special effort has been
made by his committee to make them the
most attractive that have ever been seen
at any celebration the Iwive Sons have
yet undertaken. One float alone wiil cost
in the neighborhood of $200 and will be
Miss Zetta Kohlberg; of the Native Daughters' Committee at Stockton*
typical of California and the order. Sev
eral of the floats that are to be used in the
water carnival will also be used in the
street parade, and will lend attractiveness
to the pageant.
One of the most active committees is
that having charge of the water carnival.
To-nigbt Chairman Grant announced the
names of those who would assist him.
They are: W. W. Westbay, Ralph P. Lane,
Charles J. Haas, George J. Becker, Bert
Lewis, A. V. Wilbur, M. J. Musto and W.
E. O'Connor. There will be four principal
floats in the water pageant, and they will
be very elaborate. Besides these there will
be seven smaller ones. Most of the money
at the disposal of the committee will bs
expended on light.
McLeod's Lake will be the principal
scene of the water carnival. It is an ideal
spot for an affair of this kind and is situ
ated in the center of the city. On ene
side is a fringe of willows, which will be
filled with hundreds of Japanese lanterns.
The effect will be as beautiful as fairy
land.
Last year at the Fourth of July carnival
seats were arranged on the northern bank
of the lake and sold at a high premium.
This year there will be nothing of the
John Kerriek, Chairman of the
Reception Committee at
Stockton*
kind, and all may freely see the display
upon the water. On the southern bank of
the lake a platform will be built and there
the rockets and bombs will be sent into
the clear nigut air, for Stockton always
has perfect nights in September.
At Goodwater Grove on September 8

welfare. The Supervisors have allotted
three large rooms on the third floor of the

the Native Daughters, and here tbe re
ception committee will keep open house
during the three days' celebration.

The Native Daughters deaerve special
mention for their endeayorÃ. They car
ried out the idea of holding a moonlight
picnic at Good water Grove last month and
the affair was such a success, socially as
well as financially, that the picnic will be
repeated on the 20th instant. Among the
chief workers in Joaquin Parlor are Miss
Ida Sperry, Mrs. Lena Mills, Mrs. Jobn
W. Willy. Miss Ida Safferhill and Miss
Zetta Kohlberg. The last named is one of
Stockton's famed beauties, and she has
been untiring in her efforts to make the
coming picnic a success.
Last night an appropriation was made
to bring the militia companies here from
Merced and Modesto. An entertainment
in the shape of a minstrel show by local
talent was being arranged to provide funds
for this purpose, but now the proceeds will
be turned over to the carnival committee
The minstrels will show at the Yosemite
Tneater on September 2 and tbe pro
gramme as arranged is sure to draw a
crowded house.
Attorney Arthur Levinsky is preparing
a farce to be given by the burnt cork ar
tists, and a grand ballet by tbe partici

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, 1896.
STEWART RUSHES
TO THE DEFENSE,
Replies to the Charges Made
by Thurston Against
Bryan.
"SLANDER AND LIBEL."
"My Dear Senator" Given a
Lecture by the Venerable
Sagebrush Statesman.
ASKED TO PUBLICLY EETRACT.
Dust Thrown to Cover the Main
Issues Relating to the Boy
Orator's Silver Speeches.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 17â This
afternoon Senator W. M. Stewart gave out
for publication a reply to Senator
Thurston's letter to him, published in the
papers this morning, regarding the charge
that Mr. Bryan had been a paid lecturer
in the employ of silver mine-owners. The
letter quotes Thurston's statement that
he had not assailed Bryan's character in
any instance or by any word, and Stewart
asks Thurstou how he can reconcile that
statement with the following language
used by him in the speech wh.ch gave rise
to the contest:
"The proprietors of the big bonanzas
have found it profitable to keep a large
number of lecturers and other spokesmen
on the road preaching to the people.
Among the many who have thus been
employed and carried on the payrolls of
the big bonanzas for a number of years is
William J. Bryan of Nebraska, a paid
agent and spokesman of the free-silver
letter."
The combine then says:
"Your disclaimer in connection with the
foregoing requires explanation, provided
you consider your reputation for truth
and veracity valuable. But your explana
tion that you 'would be the last man to
assail the character of Mr. Bryan' reflects
either upon your veracity or your knowl
edge of the law^ of libel. If you are a
lawyer, and the fact thac you have been
retained by the Union Pacffic Railroad for
so many years, indicates that you are use
ful in some way to that inst it ution, you
ought to know that repeating a siander or
libel is equally as slanderous or libelous as
tbe original matter.
"You assume that you are not assailing
Mr. Bryan when you quote what irrespon
sible newspapers say of him and giving to
such statements all the cradit your high
official position can confer. You belittle
your understanding when you say it is the
duty of Mr. Bryan to enter into personal
controversy with every hireling newspaper
scribbler who is employed to slander or
defame him.
"The people understand the aims of
partisan newspapers and make proper al
lowances for their assertions, but when
you clothe their slanders with your official
robes it i 3 a lame and cowardly defense oa
your part to protect yourself by skulking
behind miserable newspaper scribblers. I
called your attention to the injury of your
charge, not the charge of newspapers,
which I have again quoted for the purpose
of calling your attention to the charge
you made, supposing your were an honor
able man and would retract the charges at
once if you were unable to prove them.
Instead of doing so you repeat other slan
ders against Mr. Bryan, myself, Senator
Sharon, Governor Stanford and others,
which, if true, do not prove your charge
against Mr. Bryan.
"I shall not reiterate in kind and quote
what venal newspapers or even respectable
men cay of you, because it is not perti
nent to the issue. The issue is whether
you have unjustly and without truth as
sailed the character of Mr. Bryan. You
cannot avoid that issue by pretending
that you only repeated a falsehood which
somebody else originated. Do you fear
the repealing of a falsehood repeated
to irresponsible papers will impair your
influence in that cause you are advocat
ing? You must remember, my dear Sena
tor, that there is a sense of public justice
which is outraged by slander and libel
which you cannot justify by claiming you
have a right to repeat it because you had
not the courage to originate it. If you
have no case against Mr. Bryan, which
you have already virtually admitted by
citing incompetent hearsay evidence to
prove your charges, your slanders will be
harmless so far as he is concerned; but
can you afford to be published to the
world as a peddler of slanders which you
cannot prove? If you have any friends
who supposed that you were both honest
and brave they will be sorely disappointed
if you fail to frankly avow your error and
retract your slanders, or prove the truth
of your charges which I have quoted
above. Yours very respectfully,
"William M. Stew am."
APPEAL TO ALL
TRUE DEMOCRATS
[Continued from First Pagc\
circulation, injuring If not destroying do
mestic trade and foreign commerce.
While professing to advocate a policy of bi
metallism, it censures the present Democratic
administration for maintaining the parity of
gold and sliver. It proposes to reduce this
country to a condition of silver monometal
lism, with its vacillating and unreliable
standard of values, and tends to bring the
farmer, the wage-earner and the salaried man
to the wretched condition of the same classes
in countries in which the silver standard pre
vails, and where the rewards of agriculture
and labor are lower than anywhere in the
world.
With what seems to be a deliberate attempt
to mislead the people, it asserts that by the
coinage act of 1873 the United States aban
doned tbe use of silver as money, and that
gold has appreciated and commodities fallen
in price solely by reason of this legislation. It
ignores the fact that the prices of commodities
have fallen because of the enlarged use of
labor-saving machinery, increased production
and resulting competition. It suppresses the
fact that a potent reason for the decline in the
price of silver has been the discovery of new
and cheaply worked mines, resulting in an
increase in its production. Instead of recog
nizing these facts, it appeals to the prejudice
of the people. It demands the free coinage of
silver at tbe arbitrary and fictitious ratio of 16
to 1, although the ratio in the world's
market is as 32 to 1, and as no other
experience nor reason warrants the belief
that the commercial ratio between the
metals can be reduced by the action
of this Government to any ratio ever approxi
mating that proposed ; threatens in certain con
tingencies to increase to an unlimited act the
volume of legal-tenders issued by tbe Federal
Government, the ultimate effect of which
would be to force the withdrawal of all coin
from circulation and to compel public and
private business to be transacted in depre
ciated paper currency, constantly fluctuating
in value, and to invite the ruin and confusion
that have always followed the adoption of .guch
a policy.
Its declarations invite and have almost pro
duced a financial panic, and many of Its pro
ponents announce to accomplish this purpose
they are prepared to involve their country in a
disaster comparable to nothing in its history
save the calamity of civil war. It assails the
independence of the judiciary by a covert
threat to reorganize the courts whenever their
decisions contravene the decrees of the party
caucus. It seeks to allure othce-beekers and
spoilsmen to its support by attacking the
existing civil-service laws which good men of
all parties have labored so long to establish
and to extena to all departments of the public
service.
The Chicago convention having thu3 de
parted from the recognized Democratic faith
and promulgated doctrines new and strange
to the Democracy, all Democrats are absolved
from obligation to support its programme.
More than this, as the doctrines announced
are destructive to National honor and private
obligation, and tend to create sect and class
distinctions and engender discord and strife
among the people, ail good citizens of the Re
public are bound to repudiate them and exert
every lawful means to Insure the defeat of the
candidates that represent these false doc
trines.
Democrats are told that they must accept
the platform enunciated and ticket nominated
at Chicago because submission to the will of
the majority is a fundamental principle of
Democracy. It is true that wnen a majority
of the people have expressed their will at a
legal election the will of such majority must
be respected and obeyed. This is essential to
the peace and existence of the Nation. But it
is a monstrous perversion of this doctrine to
aptly it to a political party which exists only
by virtue of a common voluntary assent to its
principles.
When a Democratic coaveution departs from
the principles of the party no Democrat re
mains under any moral obligation to support
its action, nor is there any tradition of the
party that requires him to do so. On the con
trary, it is evidence of moral weakness for any
man to vote to enforce policies which, in his
opinion, are inimical to the welfare of the peo
ple or to the integrity of the Nation.
The duty of the hour is to stand steadfast in
the defense of our ancient faith. In this crisis
there is at stake more than a possibility of tem
porary victory. The honor and perpetuity of
the Democratic party are at stake. A political
organization that is untrue to its principles,
history and traditions is disgraced and dis
honored. The existence of our great historical
party, that has withstood the assaults of every
foe, is threatened by reason of the recre ancy
of many of its members. That this party, as
we have known it, may not die, let the faith
ful of years rally around Its historic banner,
reform its broken lines and with abiding faith
in the triumph of its principles unite to re
store the name Democrat to its former mean
ing and proud distinction.
To this end we request all Democrats who
are opposed to the platform adopted and can
didates nominated at Chicago to organize in
their several States and to send representa
tives to the convention of the National Demo
cratic party, to be held at Indianapolis on
Wednesday, September 2, 1896, in accordance
with the call heretofore issued by the Natioaal
Committee. W. D. Byxuji (Chairman),

CAN'T HAVL DOWN WATS ON..
That Tower Remains With the Xatinnal
and A'ot the Executive Committee,
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 17.â An er
roneous impression exists that the Popu
list committee meeting called for to-mor
row is one of the National Committee's,
when it is simply a meeting of the execu
tive committee, consisting of nine mem
bers, as follows: Marion Butler of North
Carolina, chairman ; M. C. Rankin of In
diana, treasurer; J. A. Edgerton of Ne
braska, secretary; George F. Washburu of
Massachusetts, H. E. Reed of Georgia,
Dr. C. F. Taylor of Pennsylvania, J. R.
Sovereign of Arkansas, John W. Breiden
thal of Kansas, John S. Dore of California.
Messrs. Edgerton, Reed and Washburn
are already here.
The principal business will be the selec
tion of National headquarters and the
mapping out of a plan of campaign. It
may be determined to call a meeting of
the full National Committee for some
future date to consider matters over which
the executive committee has no jurisdic
tion. The executive committee can take
no action looking to the removal of Mr.
Watson as a Vice-Presidential candidate
and the substitution of Mr. Sewall, having
no authority in the piemises. The Na
tional Committee alone could take any
definite action in the matter.
No prediction can be made as to tbe
selection of headquarters. The Eastern
and Southern members of the executive
committee are aaid to favor Washington,
while the Western men are favorably dis
posed toward Chicago, the opinion in each
instance being based on accessibility of
the point. Five of the nine members live
nearer Chicago than Washington.
Committeeman Reed of Brunswick, Ga.,
says that his State is all right as far as the
Populists are concerned. There is no danger
of Mr. Watson being withdrawn, as be is
their candidate and will continue to be so.
Mr. Reed expresses great satisfaction at
the manner in whiffh Mr. Watson replied
to Chairman Jones, to the effect that the
Populists should form a combination with
the negroes, as they belonged together.
While not knowing whether the chairman
had intended these sentiments for publi
cation, he felt inclined to the belief that
they fairly represented his opinion.
Mr. Butler is not expected to reach here
before to-morrow, just in time to attend
the committee meeting.
The Republican committee is preparing
extracts from all of Mr. Bryan's free-trade
speeches delivered while a member of tbe
House, and will issue them as a campaign
document. A large number of requests
have already been made for the publica
tion. Several letters received state that
the speeches will prevent many of those
believing in free silver from voting for
Bryan if it can be demonstrated that he
favors absolute free trade.
Tbe Democratic headquarters were de
serted to-day, none of the officials having
returned from their Sunday outings.
Democrats Who Savor , fusion.
DENVER,CoLO.,Aug. 17.â TheArapahoe
County Democratic convention in this
city to-day eelected 175 delegates to the
State convention in Pueblo on Wednes
day, binding them to the unit rule on the
question of fusion.
Resolutions were adopted indorsing Sen
ator Teller and Congressman Shaforth
(R.) and Bell (Pop.), and favoring fusion
of the several elements in favor of the
financial plank of the Chicago convention,
"to the end that the State campaign be
simplified, and the efforts of our citizens
be expended in aiding the cause in the
doubtful commonwealths."
A caucus of the delegates i* being held
to-night to determine upon the method of
fusion and a basis for an agreement j upon
the State ticket.
BRYAN JOURNEYS
UP THE HUDSON,
Although Seeking Rest He
Finds Time Enough
to Talk.
LEVEE ON A STEAMBOAT
Several Passengers Received by
the Weary Orator of the
Platte Region.
ONE SPEECH AT A STATION.
Interrupted by a Question That Was
Rather Difficu t to Frankly
Answer.
TARRYTOWN, N. V., Aug. 17.âWil
liam Jennings Bryan laughed this morn
ing when some one suggested that his title
be changed to "the Boy Orator of the
Hudson." The remark was apropos ot
the fact that Mr. Bryan made part of his
northward journey by means of the Hud
son River dayboat Albany. Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan, Mr. Sewall and the membersv of
John Brisben Walker's family had an
eariy breakfast at the Walker residence at
Irvington. There were some uncertain
ties as to whether the Albany would stop
at Irvington, and when it was learned
from the steamboat company that the
depth of water was not sufficient to permit
the vessel to make a landing Mr. Bryan,
Mr. Sewali and the others of the party
took a train to Yonkers to catch the Al
bany there. As they drove past the Cos
mopolitan (magazine) building on their
way to the Irvington station they were
cheered b/ the employes, and there was
more cheering as the train pulled out.
The train reached Yonkers at 9:35, and
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan and their friends went
immediately to the Albany's landing.
The vessel had arrived, and, after good
bys to Mr. Sewall and Mr. Walker, the
Presidential nominee and Mrs. Bryan
started at 9:45 on their trip up the Hud
son.
Several hundred persons were on the
boat, and many of these pressed around
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan with hands out
stretched until tha boat had started up
stream. A stateroom was placed at the
disposal of the candidate and his wife by
the steamboat officials, and in this they
received a number of the passengers.
It was 1:20 p. m. whpn the Albany
reached Poughkeepsie. Four hundred peo
ple were gathered on the wharf and a
cheer was given as Mr. Bryan walked over
the gangplank. The crowd followed Mr.
Bryan to the Central station, where
he was surrounded in the waiting
room and finally forced out on the plat
form. Here, mounted on a truck, ne made
a little speech, the first since his appear
ance at Madison-square Garden. He said :
I am coming up here into this section of the
State for a rest and therefore am not going to
make any speech here. Ido not expect to be
able to see you again and I take this opportu
nity of thanking you for the interest you are
taking in tbe campaign. From reading some
of the New York papers it would seem that
there is no silver sentiment in New York, but
the great daily papers are not able to suppress
the sentiment of the masses of the people.
[Cheers.] I believe that this campaign will be
characterized by more intense feeling than
any in which we younger men have been en
gaged. In this campaign the people are think
ing, and when the people think they decide,
and when they decide they act. The so-called
financiers think they have the right to use the
Dallot to pertect their interests. Why have
not the rest of the people the right to use the
ballot to protect their own interest?
Here Mr. Bryan stopped, but in response
to cries of "more" he asked: "How many
of you have been studying the silver ques
tion? Hold up your hands."
A number of hands were raised.
"Now let me ask each of you to consider
this question."
A voice, interruptingâ How are you for
the working classes?
Mr. Bryanâ You take what I have said
and what I have done and let the thinking
people decide. [Applause]. It is not for
a candidate to tell you how to vote. I
have too much respect for the rights of
individuals to attempt to tell any one how
to vote. I can simply defend the policies
for which I stand and let the people choose
between my opponent and myself. But I
desire you to find out what your duty is
and to have the courage to do it.
Mr. Bryan held a short reception and
took the New York Cential train for Tar
ry town at 1 :50 p. m.
The ride from Poughkeepsie to Tarry
town was short and was made in an or
dinary day coach. At Tarrytown, reached
at 2:30, Mr. and Mrs. Bryan were met by
Mr. and Mrs. \\\ C. Perrine, and after
some of the twoscore people at the little
station had shaken hands with them they
were driven off by the Pernnes to their
home at Upper Red Hook, six miles dis
tant.
BRYAN IN SECLUSION.
Makes Another Speech Before Beginning
Hit Letter of Acceptance. - r '
UPPER RED HOOK, Duxchkss' County.'
N. . V. v , Aug. 17.â Here In this little village,
away from the busy whirl of politics, Wil
liam J. Bryan has established himself for
. a week or ten days of quiet to enable him
to compose . his : letter of acceptance. Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan are the guests of Mr. Per
rine. ';-; Mrs. Perrine â  was Mrs. f Bryan's
teacher at the Female ;' Academy in Jack- j
sonville, 111., the I town where ; the j DemoÂ«
cratic candidate also resided the principal
part of his youth. 1 The candidate and his !
wife reached Tarry town this afternoon by
train : from Poughkeepsie, ; and with Mr.
and Mrs. Perrine and T. W. Cuthbright,
Mr. Bryan's secretary, drove six miles
through a beautiful farming country to
the home of Mr. Perrine. J
To-night there was an outpouring of
citizens from this place and neighboring
villages to give him proper welcome.
Party lines were not drawn in the recep
tion given Mr. and Mrs. Bryan by Mr.
and Mrs. Perrine, and there were many
Republicans at the gathering. Jacob El
seffer, a lawyer, introduced Mr. Bryan,
who spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:
Speaking for Mrs. Bryan as well as for myself,
I desire to thank the gentleman who has so
graciously extended the welcome, and the
people who support his word by their pres
ence. It gives us great pleasure to come here
upon this occasion and renew an old-time
acquaintance witb one of our esteemed
"citizens. In reaching this spot we
have passed up the river of which we have so
often beard, but which until this visit we
knew nothing. We have been impressed with
the fact that this river and its surroundings
are not only pleasing to the eyes of those who
love beauty of scenery but are also pleasing to
those who are interested in the historic scenes
of revolutionary days. We shall remember
with great delight tbis our first acquaintance
with them. We are glad to find our rest in
this quiet place among the people who exem
plify the truth spoken by the wise men so
many hundreds of years ago. When Solomon
said he desired neither riches nor poverty he
gave expression to a thought that we may
well consider. In such a community as this
we find an equality and fraternity, and
we find people bound tocether in a friend
ship that stands for all that is good
and uplifting in the human race. We
are glad to come among you. We are glad to
rest here for a few days from the weariness of
the campaign, and we are pleased to know
that you who live among these mountains
where you can take a broader view of these
earthly scenes are also, as citizens, able to rise
and take a broad view of our present life; that
you, Republicans as well as Democrats', can
lay aside for the moment all political thought
and gather without respect to party affilia
tions to do honor to the office to which at this
time I aspire. [Voice, "And you'll get it"] I
have always lived among those who differ
from me, and at all times I have found
some of my best friends among those
who could not agree with me on pubhe ques
tions. I expect to find it that way this year,
and in all the years to come, but I am glad the
friendship, affection and love are strong
enough to cross all lines and bind together all
congenial spirits. I am glad, too, that you
recognize that higher plane of citizenship in
which each citizen, while firmly standing by
that In which he believes and courageously
upholding the cause which he espouses as
best for his country, can at the same time ex
tend to all others that charity which he asks
for himself. lam glad that as we struggle on
with intense earnestness in carrying forward
those policies which we believe are of vital im
portance we can still, like brethren, stand side
by side without feeling that there is in these
contests anything which should draw forth
personal animosity. I thank you for your
greeting and for this opportunity of acknowl
edging your acquaintance.
Hugh J. Brady, chairman of the Bt.
Louis Central Committee, met Mr. Bryan
by accident on the steamer to-day and
had dinner with him. Mr. Eridy says
that Mr. Bryan told him that he will
speak in St. Louis between the 10th and
15th of September. In answer to a ques
tion as to whether he would make any re
ply to the speech to be delivered to-mor
row night by Hon. Bourke Cockran, Mr.
Bryan said: "Mr. Cockran and I dis
cussed both the silver question and the in
come tax while in Congress. If he ad
vances any new arguments they can go to
the country along with my speech of last
week. I shall not return to New York un
til the latter part of September, when I
expect to speak briefly in BrooKlyn on my
way to New England, and in Yew York
on my way from New England."

WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 17.â For
three hours to-day Senator Jones, chair
man of the Democratic National Commit
tee, was closeted in an upper room with
several Democrats discussing the subject
of ways and means and the best method
of conducting the campaign. â 
Those present were Mr. Johnson of
Kansas, the newly appointed member of
the campaign committee from that' State;
Senator Bacon of Georgia; C. H. Faulk
ner of the Congressional committee; Dan
McConville of Ohio; Major T. O. Towles
of Missouri, secretary of the Bimetallic
league; Hon. K. P. Bland of Missouri;
Representative Richardson of Tennessee;
Mr. Livingstone of Georgia, and Secretary
Gardiner of the league of Democratic
clubs.
Mr. Bland predicts an immense ma
jority in Missouri and says every Western
State will be loyal to free silver. He states
his belief in the triuniDh and the election
of Bryan. Mr. Livingstone expresses Â«on
fidonce that the Democrats will carry New
York, New Jersey and Delaware.
Chairman Jones leaves for Chicago to
morrow night for the purpose of arrang
ing for the headquarters. He said to-day
that he had offered Governor Stone of
Missouri a place on the campaign com
mittee, but the Governor had declined it,
as he had official duties to attend to.
"Tbis committee will not find its work
child's play," said Senator Jones. "The
members are expected to be at headquar
ters and actively engaged. Messrs. Mc-
Lean of Ohio, Smalley of Vermont and
Howell of Georgia, will be stationed in
Washington and the other members at
Chicago."
The executive committee has not yet
been agreed upon. It has also been set
tled that there will be no headquarters of
any kind in New York. If Treasurer St.
John finds it impossible to go to Chicago
he will remain in New York.
While the headquarters of the National
committee are to be located in Chicago,
the real headquarters, it is thought, will
be in this city. The naming of Chicago
was, aa one member expressed it, merely
catering to sentiment. The main wort
will be done from this city.
Although no official programme has been
arranged it is unofficially announced that
after Mr. Bryan speaks at Buffalo and
Erie on the 26th and 29th inst., he will go
direct to Lincoln and remain until after
the first week in September.
He will then go to St. Louis between the
7th and 10th of that month, when he w ill
speak, thence going to Louisville. Prom
that point his tentative itinerary includes
Atlanta, portions of North Carolina,
Richmond and Baltimore. He will arrive
in the latter city some time between the
15th and the 20th of September, where he
will be formally notified of his nomina
tion by the silver party. Between Rich
mond and .Baltimore it is expected he will
speak at a meeting to be held in this city.
After October 1 he will confine himself to
the Middle Western States of Ohio, In
diana, Illinois, Michigan, lowa, Wiscon
sin and Minnesota.

General Miles Will Soon Make a Tonr
of Inspection and File a
Report
WASHINGTON, D. C, Ang. 17.â The
recommendation of General Miles, look
ing to the establishment o! new artillery
posts in connection with the approved
scheme of the country's coast defenses is
a subject which is occasioning much in
terest in military circles. As already
stated in The Call, General Miles recom
mended that as a number of new batteries
had been built and guns placed thereon,
and as those at other points were nearing
completion, it was important that artillery
troops should be stationed at those places
to insure the preservation of batterie* and
guns, and to afford the men and officers
an opportunity to practice with them.
Previously to making the recommenda
tion the general gave the subject serious
reflection. Coast defenses he regards as a
question of which both the army and the
country ought to be seriously concerned.
His suggestions were based upon personal
observation and thorough knowledge of
requirements.
becretary Lamont has given the recom
mendations preliminary consideration.
The official conclusion has practically
been reached that places where new bat
teries have been established and where
they are soon to be put, should have
troops to look out for the fortifications.
The only question in the case seems to be
how many men shali be assigned and the
manner and length of their detail. There
appears to be a disposition not to per
manently reduce the strength of estab
lished posts, for the reason that at many
of these it is only a question of time until
new batteries and modern guns are placed
there. If Congress will provide tor one or
two additional regiments of artillery
the difficulty will be solved, but until
Congress appropriates money it is argued
this is not possible. There are exceptions
to this rule, noticeable in the case of Fort
Hancock. Troops are required now
and from the present time forward need
of their presence will become greater. It
can be stated as a fact that Secretary
Lamont will order a force of artillery to
Hancock at the earliest possible date.
In course of time, or as soon as ade
quate quarters and barracks are provided,
there will be four batteries at this station.
But for such places as Fort Washington,
on the Potomac River, a different propo
sition is under consideration. This is
temporarily to detail for a certain period
of time a suitable squad of soldiers to be
taken from an adjacent post as caretakers
of batteries and guns. Some such ar
rangement is now in force at Lime Point,
San Francisco Harbor. General Graham,
commanding the Presidio, orders from
time to time a detachment of men for ser
vice at that place. Those who favor this
proposition say that its adoption is merely
a temporary expedient. In time they say
there is no doubt that new defenses must
constitute new posts, but for the present
tbey seem to think that, all things con
sidered, it will be sufficient to detail from
every station squads of men under non
commissioned officers as caretakers
of new batteries and guns. Those
who favor that General Miles' recommen
dations be carried out literally as suggested
don't favor the idea of ordering temporary
caretakers to new batteries. They claim
that at a number of artillery stations there
is now an unnecessarily larse number of
troops and that a force from these ought
to be detached and sent to the modern de
fenses. They summarize their views by
the remark that it is neither good policy
nor necessary to make two bites of a
cherry. Tbey refer especially to the artil
lery post at Washington and argue that
that station could be dispensed with en
tirely, providing at once four batteries for
service elsewhere. They regard it as un
military to assign to modern defenses
temporary details of men.
One officer speaking of the matter said
to The Call correspondent: "The army
will be made ridiculous before the country
if at points where there are modern forti
fications we place a squad of men. When
ever possible we should establish regu
lar forces at these places. Of course, Con
gress must come to the rescue; but the
army cannot afford to be put in the light
of not properly and promptly garrisoning
its new coast defenses. Do we ever fail
promptly to send men to new infantry or
cavalry posts?"
An officer of high rank, whose views on
all questions are conservative, said that it
was only a question of time until General
Miles' recommendations were adopted lit
erally as made. He meant by this, he said,
that the more carefully recommendations
were considered the wiser and sounder
they would appear.
As already intimated in The Call's dis
patches Generai Miles has in contempla
tion an important tour of inspection. He
proposes at an early, convenient date to
visit a number of Western posts, includ
ing several which he has never seen, and
others which may in the near future be
abandoned. The general's departure will
depend upon the condition of public busi
ness. At present he is unable to say just
when he will start on his tour. A number
of questions of importance are now pend
ing, and he does not think of going away
un tiJ these have been disposed of.
It is a fact not generally known through
out the army that a proposition is under
consideration by the authorities to aban
don several army posts no longer thought
essential. For reasons satisfactory to
themselves the officials decline at present
to ~iva the names of th* posts. Upon his
return to Washington General Miles will
make a report to the Secretary oi War as
to the results of his inspection. In the re
port he will mate such recommendations
as he deems advibable relative to the con
dition of the posts under discussion, to
gether, with the action which should be
taken concerning tne transfer of troops
flow there to other stations.
The Call correspondent learns that a
short time ago General Miles recom
mended that an army post be established
at Albuquerque, N. M., and stated that
this place had many advantages for a mili
tary station, including the healthful cli
mate and facilities for transportation, re
sulting from the touching of two railroads
at the place. General Miles will not dis
cuss the matter, Dut another official says
that at no distant date Albuquerque is
destined to succeed Wingate, and that the
latter will be abandoned.
LIGHTED BY A MONSTER TORCH.
West Virginia Oil Fields Illuminated by
a Burning H ell.
SISTERVILLE, W. Va., Aug. 17.â The
Ogden oil field was the scene last night of
the most brilliant spectacle ever witnessed
in this State. The famous Newbanks oil
well, which is also a strong producer of
{.-as, took fire through accident. The der
rick and several thousand barrels of oil
were burned.
When the pressure was reduced at the
mouth of the well the gas broke the
spouting oil into sprays, throwing it into
the air more than 100 feet. The flame was
in the shape of a huge torch, the spraying
oil forming into glistening drops in the
air and dropping in a dazzling shower,
while the smoke, densely black, rolled
away above the mountain. The hills last
night were crowded by sightseers, who
came from all over the region.
The loss to the owner 3is enormous, as
the wells were producing 200 barrels a day.
There is no way to put out the fire, as the
gas and oil pressure are constant and the
roaring beat of the flames terrific.
IWLBOX'B MURDEBOVB RAGE.
Killed Hit Wife and Tried to Shoot His
Child.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 17.â 1n a fit of
jealousy Charles Nelson this morning
shot and killed his wife in their home on
Northwestern avenue. After sending two
bullets into the woman's left breast the
murderer turned upon their three-year-old
daughter and fired a shot at her. The
bullet struck the child on the right side of
the temple, inflicting a slight wound.
Nelson was arrested.
At the station the murderer refused to
talk about his crime. He was very sulky
and the prison officials had to watch him
closely to see that he did not commit
suicide. His reputation is not very good
with people who know him. The neigh
bors say that he was a regular brute to bis
family and with everybody with whom lie
came in contact. He was very jealous of
his wife and often quarreled with her
without any provocation. Of late be has
been acting queerly and the tragedy this
morning is believed to be due to tempo
rary insanity on his part.
NICOLLETI LANDS IN JAIL
Causes a Sidewalk Blockade
While Peddling His "Great
Gold Conspiracy" Book.
Claims to be the Author of the Work
and Silverites Howl Over His
Incarceration.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 17.âCali
fornia's Italian colony in Washington con
sists of Celso Cse.Â«ar Moreno, formerly
Premier to King Kalakaua, which office
he held twenty-four hours, and Stephen
Nicolleti of Los Angeles. Moreno has
just served a sentence in jail for libeling
Baron Fava, Italian Minister to the
United States, and now Nicolleti has been
arrested and jailed for obstructing the
sidewalk with his push cart from which
he peddles a book entitled "The Great
Gold Conspiracy or the worst form of
nnance in the world."
The strange spectacle of this itinerant
perambulating literary . Italian peddling
nis own book: from a banana-cart has
greatly amused the Washington people.
He declares that he wrote the work him
self, but his broken English seems to belie
his words. He pushes his cart up and
down the main thoroughfares of Washing
ton, crying out that he has literary wares
for sale. "Nice-a book, nice-a book, nfta
cent â vera cheap; I write-a myself-a."
Nicolleti has displayed conspicuously on
his cart framed autograph letters from
prominent politicians and statesmen,
among them being Senator White of Cali
fornia. Nicolleti also exposes to the gaze
of pedestrians tne illiteracy of M. C. Ran
kin, treasurer of the National Populist
party, who, in his letter to Nicolleti, says
he "seen a coppy of it and wants four
more coppies for educational purposes."
Nicolleti was haranguing a crowd on
Pennsylvania avenue and crying his book
for sale when an official of the W T ar Depart
ment engaged him in debate on the money
question and other economic questions.
The street was soon crowded and the side
walk im passable. The bystanders evi
dently thought Nicolleti was getting the
best of the argument, for they cheered
him wildly, which irritated his adversary.
The Ja'.ter went to the police station,
swore out a complaint against the Italian,
and he was arrested. The silver cranks
are exaggerating the importance cl this
incident, and to-morrow's New York
Journal will declare that it is an outrage
on the part of the Cleveland cuckoos to
arrest poor old Nicolieti. It is hardly
believed, however that the Italian's im
prisonment will assume international pro
portions.

Suit to Prevent the Floating of Addi
tional Indebtedness.
DULUTH, Minn., Aug. 17. -R. D. Mal
let, president of one of the ward silver
clubs here, has brought suit against the
city of Duluth to prevent the issue of
106,000 of gold bonds, the proceeds of
which are to be used in building a water
plant. The complaint sets forth that the
election authorizing the issue was favor
able, but it alleges that the bonds, which
were sold to the L Edward C. Jones Com
pany of Chicago and ordered to be issued,
are not such bonds as were authorized by
the election. The bonds are made paya
ble, interest and principal, in gold coin of
the United States. -;>'-. â â â -.:.->. â *::':
The complaint states that the Common
Council had no power or authority to i is
sue such bonds. Mallet further alleges
that the bonded indebtedness of the city
is now in excess of the State law,' which
provides that it shali not exceed 5 per
cent of the , assessed valuation - T of i taxable

College Laboratory Burned.
CHAMPAIGN, 111., Aug. 17.â The
chemical laboratory building, one of the
group on the grounds of the University of
Illinois, was almost totally destroyed by
tire yesterday.
A severe electric storm was raging an
hour or so prior to the fire, and while it is
not definitely Known, it is supposed that
the fire originated from lightning. The
loss will reach $75,000.
The United States experimenting sta
tion had its main laboratory on the top
floor of the burned building and it sus
tained a severe io;s. All the records kept
there were destroyed, but in some in
stances duplicates of them remain in other
buildings.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, 1896.
BROKEN HEADS
NEAR BELFAST,
Serious Riots Caused by a
Demonstration of the
Nationalists.
AMNESTY IS DEMANDED
Paraders Stoned and Jeered and
in Turn They Assail
Tormenters.
POLICE AND TBOOF3 CALLED-
Charges With Drawn Bayonets Made
Upon the Rioters Before Order
Is Restored.
BELFAST, leelaitd, Aug. 17.â A large
Nationalist demonstration in favor of
granting annesty to all political prisoners
took place here to-day. An immense pro
cession of Nationalists marched through
the streets and proceeded to Haunastown,
a suburb of Belfast, headed by bands of
music and displaying numerous banners
bearing inscriptions indicating the pur
pose of the movement.
The streets w<;re lined with spectators,
who hooted, groaned and jeered the pro
cessionists and finally threw a few stones
at the paraders. Some of the paraders
were armed with spears, and these men
made an attack upon their tormentors
despite tbe efforts of the police, who were
out in full force to prevent them. A
fierce fight ensued, and the police made
several charges withdrawn bayonets upon
the combatants, as the result of which
there were a great number of broken
heads. A dozen or more rioters were
taken to the hospital after order was re
stored.
After noon the city magistrates held a
meeting and ordered that the troops be in
readiness to put down the disturbance
which it was feared would occur when the
paraders returned from Hannastown in
the evening. Every preparation was ac
cordingly made to suppress any attempt
at rioting and for a time the center of the
city, to which the disturbances of the morn
ing were confined, was quiet, although the
streets were alive with excited people.
The procession returned to Belfast in
the evening, when it was soon seen that
the misgivings of the authorities were not
unfounded. As the procession approached
the city the greatest excitement prevailed.
A number of opppoisiion mobs had gath
ered along the intended route of the pro
cession on its return with the object of
making an attack upon the parader3, and
to prevent noting of the most active char
acter, the police barred the route which
had been laid out for the return march,
and then turned the parade off into
another direction.
In the meantime a heavy rain began
falling, but this had not the slightest
effect in diminishing the size of the
crowds which thronged the streets, nor in
allying the excitement of tbe people.
The crowd was not aware of the route
taken by the paraders 'until it was too late
to make an attack upon them, and the
procession broke up without further
trouble. The crowd did not disperse until
late, but despite their threats there was no
further disorder. The rain fell heavily,
and this finally had the effect of dispers
ing the mob.
GAIL HAMILTON'S DEATH,
Close of the Eventful Career of
Mary Abigail Dodge, the
Writer.
Passes Away Without Regaining Con
sciousness From a Stroke of
Paralysis.
WENHAM, Mass., Aug. 17.â Mary Abi
gail Dodge (Gail Hamilton) died at 8:55
o'clocK to-night without regaining con
sciousness since she was stricJten Sunday
morning.
Her illness dated from Sunday morning,
when she suffered a stroke of paralysis
while seated at table. The stroke was de
clared by her physician to be probably
fatal. Dr. Thayer informed his patient
that she would not live the day out, but
she surprised all by lingering until this
evening. Miss Dodge was possessed of
great vitality, which enabled her to bear
up under the paralytic stroke.
When Miss Dodge had once more re
gained her health after a stroke of paraly
sis several months ago she came to her
birthplace, Hamilton, where she re
mained until her death.
Miss Mary Abigail Dodge, who will al
ways be best remembered by her norn de
plume of Gail Hamilton, was essentially
a New Englander by instinct and associa
tion, as well as by birth. She was one of
a coterie of brilliant Massachusetts
literary women who left their impress
upon the century in which they lived.
A generally accepted impression that
Gail Hamilton was a blood relative of the
late James G. Blame is erroneous. She
was simply a cousin of Mrs. Blame, but
for many years she was an intimate asso
ciate ot the Blame household, and often
assisted the great Maine leader in his
literary work.
For some time previous to her long ill
ness in 1895 Miss Dodge was engaged in
arranging the papers of the deceased
statesman, with a view of publishing a
biography which would do him justice.
Shortly after Mr. Biaine's death she
sent to the Washington office of the
United Associated Presses a statement
written in her strong, clear-cut, masculine
hand declaring that she alone had the
right to publish an authorized biography
of James G. Blame, and warning all others
from attempting to undertake that work.
In the biography of Miss Dodge fur
nished the encyclopedias it is stated that
she was born in Hamilton, Mass., "about
1830." This would certainly justify the
assumption that "Gail Hamilton" was at
least 65 years of age when paralysis seized
her vigorous intellect. Her published
works number many volumes.
She was also until lately a constant con
tributor to the newspaper press, especially
to the New York Tribune. She had vigor
on* convictions which she expreeaed in
graceful and forceful language.
BUTCHERED BY THE SPANISH.
Vigorous Protest Sent to Secretary Olney
Against the Wanton Killing of Cor
respondent Govin.
KRY WEST. Fla., Aug. 17.âSeveral
hundred of the most prominent citizens of
this city gathered in front of the City Hall
to-night in response to a call published
in one of the local papers to express their
indignation at the barbarous manner in
which Charles Govin of this city was
killed by Spanish soldiers, details of which
reached*this city last Saturday night. The
meeting was addressed by Ben McLenden
and several others, and the speeches were
enthusiastically received.
Resolutions were adopted, declaring sub
stantially that Govin, who was visiting
Cuba as the correspondent of a Key West
paper, was an American citizen and was
foully murdered for no other offense than
that of being an American citizen.
It was resolved to communicate the
facts to Mr. Olney and urge an investiga
tion. In accordance with this the follow
ing dispatch was sent to Secretary Olney:
A mass-meeting of 3000 American citizens
beg leave to call attention to the butchering
in Cuba of Charles Govia, an American citi
zen, plyins: the peaceful vocation of a press
correspondent. A full account of the atrocity
Is recited in the New York Herald of bunday.
As Americans we urge an immediate investi
gation and vigorous action. American citi
zens have been outraged and our National
honor Insulted by this crime.
One of the speakers, of whom there were
several, introduced three flags, an Ameri
can, a Cuban and Spanish, into the crowd.
The first two were caught up by the now
thoroughly aroused people and held aloft,
v hile the Spanish flag was torn to shreds
and dragged in the dust.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Aug. 17.âIn
formation was received here to-day by the
Cubans that an expedition, consisting of
seventy-five men and a large quantity of
war munitions, was landed in Cuba on
last Thursday. The expedition originally
set out from this country and went to a
South American port, from which place
the landing was made. A number of
Americans, including several Philadel
phians. are said to have been in the party.
MADRID, Spain, Aug. 17.â The Epocha
deniesthe report that Spain is preparing
to present to the American Government a
money claim on account of the dispatch of
filibustering expeditions to Cuba from the
United States. The Epocha is the orpau
of Senor Canovas del Castillo, the Spanish
Prime Minister.
TO BLOW UP A HOTEL
Plans of a Daring Anarchist Checked by
His Arrest by the New
York Police.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 17.â A dispatch
from New YorK say 3: A plot to destroy
the Fifth-avenue Hotel and as many of
the guests as possible has been discov
ered by the police detectives of this city,
and the prime conspirator is now a pris
oner. The plot waa revealed by a woman â
a confessed anarchist herselfâ simply be
cause she feared that her own life was in
danger.
Tne man under arrest is new to the
world of anarchism. He is Naum Fred
man, a druggist of 195 Second avenue.
The only person he is known to have
taken into his confidence is his wife, who
entered fully into his plans. She says she
advised against violence, because she be
lieved the time to be not ripe. But she
was overruled, and so went on assisting in
preparing the mixture that was to deal
death to many and cause great destruction
to property.
Captain Westervelt and detectives vis
ited the druggist's rooms. They found a
glass bottle eight inches long and two
inches in diameter. It was two-thirds full
of a dark-brewn powder. Mre. Fred man
said it was a high explosive. She told
Captain Westerveit that her husband had
made a bomb, that he intended to hire a
room in the Fifth-avenue Hotel and that
when the inmates were asleep he would
blow the building up.
Captain Westervelt, after ho reached the
station-house, tested the contents of the
bottle on a sheet of paper. He put a little
of it on the paper and laid it in the middle
of the big room. He then lit the paper.
There was an explosion louder than that
made by a gun. Tne concussion was
plainly felt in all parts of the buildine.
When questioned by the captain, Fred
man would make no statement. His wife
said that he worked alone. His object
was to further the interests of anarchy if
ha had to blow up the whole town.

Los Gatos, CaL, August 17. )
If General Fremont had started out as
The Sentinel and His Bodyguard.
[From a photograph taken expressly for "The Call.' 1 ]
the pioneer explorer that was to find a
typical place under the trees in which to
construct a platform for dancing, he
would have stopped right here in Los
Gatos at the picnic grounds where Camp
City Guard is located. A huge live oak
tree, the leaves of which are green the
year round, rises through the center of a
wide area of solid floor, and its wide
spreading branches, twisted by battles
with many a mountain wind, cover the
entire circumference. Arc electric lights
bang among the limbs, and here and there
a black shadow of tree, trunk or branch
shoots across the floor. Around each side
are convenient seats and at one end a
band stand. Other oaK trees make a
canopy of living green for the musicians
and spectators. The floor is white.
The gallant guardsmen and fair belles
of Los Gatos and Saa Francisco who are
here danced in and out of the lights, their
shadows making silhouettes and fantastic
figures on the floor. There was just
enough shadow to add a little wildness to
the scene and make it picturesque. To
night the natural amphitheater under the
tree? was tilled with devotees of Terpsicore,
the larger portion of ihs younger pop-
I ulation of Los Gaios being present either
'as dancers or spectators or both. The oc
i casion partook of the nature of a reception :
I by Cora pan v B to the hobpitable people of
j Los Gatos." A number of couples were
also present from San Jose.
There was fun in camp last night. Safe
inside the picket-line, with the familiar
"all's well" sounding among the sentinels,
the guardsmen went to bed early and slept
the sleep of the soldier, tired after a long
Sunday of entertaining and sweet do
nothing.
For half ar. hour before all had passed
from the world of consciousness into
' dreamland strong voices in the tents were
! frequently heard shouting a quotation
I from a well-known drama. Tne story is
! that a tenderfoot in the mountains meets
an old miner and tremblingly says:
"Say, mister, are there any bears in these
mountains?"
"Bars! Why, these 'ere mountains is
full of bars I" replies the mimer in a voice
j of thunder, and the tenderfoot promptly
seeks cover.
Being in a valley of the Santa Cruz
Mountains the soldier boys appropriated
I this passage and shouted it at the tops of
their voices. And it really seemed a perti
nent question to the city fellows after
things quieted down a bit.
Acting Sergeant I. R. Townsend went to
sleep with his senses abnormally im-
I pressed with danger from "bars," as it
j subsequently developed. Corporal Meyers
occupies the same tent with Townsend.
About midnight there was a terrible
j racket in Townsend's tent, followed by a
j discharge of his rifle, shouts of "Bars!"
"Help!" and "Corporal of the guard!"
W. L. Overstreet was corporal of tte
guard and he came running, lantern in
hand, to find out what was the trouble.
He discovered Sergeant Townsend in his
couch in a sitting posture, witu his fingers
tightly entwined in the hair of a brown
dog.
It was ludicrous for everybody but the
brown dog. He looked pained.
Townsend bad awakened, stretched out
his arms, and his hands coming in con
tact with a living, moving, hairy body,
' he had thought instantly of "bars" and
set up a call for assistance.
The dog was arrested and placed in the
guardhouse, but this morning was released
i and fed. He is now a favorite in camp.
He is sometimes referred to as "Town
send's bar." He came wandering out of
i the dark nowhere of the night, and the
dawn brought him friends.
Corporal Townsend has been in the Na
tional Guard since 1854 and has seen forty
two years consecutive service. He id well
known and is the oldest man in the mili
| tary service of the Scate. He is not afraid
of anything that walks on two legs, but as
j to four legsâ well, that's different.
This morning the guardsmen turned out
I promptly at reveille at 5 o'clock. Expe
rience in camp shows that the first morn
ing there is no trouble in getting the men
to appear for duty, but each subsequent
! morning the response to call is slower and
occasionally on the last day of camp the
blankets and the men have to be parted
before they will tumble out. This is said
to be due to the fatigue of camp life to
those unaccustomed to it, but Camp City
Guard is so pleasantly and comfortably
situated that it is expected that Company
B will be an exception to the rule.
There was an hour and a half of drill
this morning before breakfast. It was ex
tended-order drill. The men get enough
close-order drill in the armory, and when
they get out in camp and on a parade
ground where there is plenty of room
they utaKe up for lost time in the extended
order. It is, in plainer words, a field drill,
such as forming skirmish lines, deploying,
etc. There is also plenty of "knee drill" â
regular army, not Salvation Army, kind.
Captain Filmer said the company did well
this morning, considering the amount ot
practice they had had. The drill will be
continued every morning during encamp
ment.
One reason that the boys are careful to
be faithful to camp and drill duty is that
they expect the regular United States
army inspector of the National Guard to
come down on tbem suddenly. This man
is Captain Carrigan, U. S. A. The in
spector has a habit of dropping in on the
camps unexpectedly, so as not to give
them an opportunity to prepare for his
coming. Captain Carrigan is expected any
day.
This morning Captain Filmer and George
H. Adams, secretary of the Los Gatos
Board of Trade, went out toward the
mountains, not on a forage for the eggs
and chickens of the ranchers, but on a
skirmish for a range for target practice by
the company. They found a pretty fair
200-yard range not far away, and target
practice will be begun to-morrow or next
day. There will be both volley and indi
vidual shooting. Some of the marksmen

The letting loose of the carrier-pigeons
this morning with a message for The Call
was, next to dress parade, the sight and
tbe event of the day. Dick and Mary,
who have a record of speed on the wing of
more than a mile a minute, and an un-
known bird that had been sent down on ;
â  the morning train were sent into the air I
I together. Dick carried the message, in- ,'
! closed in a quill toothpick, which was tied
to his tail feathers with a thread of silk.
If there is in bird etiquette any signifi
cance in a Jordiy attitude and condescer.d-
I ing manners, Dick felt the distinction.
j Mary is his particular favorite. She was
sent along to cheer him up if they saw in
the fields a bad man with a gun. The
strange bird went along to render gen
eral assistance in the matter of direction
and vigilance. Who knows but that the
straneer may prove a record-breaker, too?
Captain Filmer released Dick, and the
others immediately followed. There was
a flapping of wings, and they were off at
! 12:20 p. M. The birds kept well bunched
I and, alter the usual manner peculiar to
: homing pigeons, they flew in ascending
j circles and suddenly veered off on a bee
! line in the direction of San Francisco and
| their lofts at the premises of their owner.
George Filmer, at 422 Jersey street. Cap
| tain Filmer said the birds ought to make
! the distance, about fifty-five miles, in an
j hour if not interfered with by a head wind,
I fog or rain, which threatened when the
i winged trio started. The idea is to test the
I practicability of homing pigeons as a means
I of communication in time of war when
I telegraph wires are down and there is no
I other means of communication.
The excellent string band Jn camp is
> composed of: Al Aptuorpe, violin; Will
| Parker and G. Bell, mandolins; J. Miller,
guitar.
Miss Emilie Sieberst is stopping at the
! El Monte and will remain during the en
campraent.
Lieutenant Thomas O'Keefe also came
into camp to-day on a visit. Extensive
preparations are being made for the grand
ball to be given Company B next Friday
night by the citizens of Los Gatos in
| Masonic Hall. It is an invitational affair.
The militiamen donned their helmets
and dres3 coats and gave a fine dress
parade on the public square this evening
at 8 o'clock. It was admired by a large
number of spectators.
PORTLAND'S LIBEL SUIT,
Special Treasury Agent Chap
pelle, an Important Wit
ness, Skips Out.
For Want of Sufficient Evidence the
Case Against Lyles Is
Dismissed.
PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 17.â A late hour
Saturday afternoon was fixed by Justice
McDevitt for the preliminary hearing of
E. C. Lyles of San Francisco, accused of
criminal libel by Joseph C. Dolan. This
was done to secure the presence oi Special
Treasury Agent A. S. Chappelle, wanted
as a witness in the case, but who managed
to elude the process of the court during
the fore part of the day.
When the time arrived for the examina
tion to be proceeded with the court was
advised that Chappelle had taken the
steamer Potter at 1 o'clock for Astoria,
whence he would sail for San Francisco
that night. Justice McDevitt remarked
that this circumstance convinced him that
Chappelle was in some manner connected
with the alleged libel, else he would have
had no occasion tc leave the city so sur
reptitiously.
The prosecution laid great stress on
Chappeile's probable testimony, and put
forth no little effort to make sere of his
attendance, but the agent waj too wily.
He came in from the sounc Saturday
morning, and his friends presumably at
once apprised him of his being wanted as
a witness in this case and he sought cover.
M. L. Pipes, for the defense, eloquently
argued a motion that the defendant then
and there be accorded a hearing, despite
the absence of Chappelle, as Lyies also de
sired to return home that night. The
court, though, overruled the motion and
continued tbe case till this mornine.
This forenoon Justice McDevitt dis
missed the information against Lylea for
want of sufficient evidence to justify hia
being held to the Grand Jury.

RONTPELIER'S BANK ROBBERS.
Fully Identified by the Wommn for Whom
They Worked.
POCATELLO, Idaho, Aug. 17.â Mrs.
P. Emelle, who lives on a ranch eight
miles north of Cokeville, Wyo.. sent a
letter to Montpelier last night saying
that the three men who robbed the bank
at Montpelier had been employed on her
ranch up to within three days of the rob
bery.
Her husband, who is a jeweler at Mont
peiier, saw them in town at the time, and
says they answer perfectly to the descrip
tion given of the robbers. One of the men
is Bob McCarthy, another "Frank," while
the name of the third was not eiven. She
says they were good workers, but that on
rainy days, and whenever they could get
away, they would go to the mountains, as
if locating a hiding-place.
They were excellent shots and always
kept themselves heavily armed and acted
very suspiciously at times.
Deputy Crnickshank left early this
morning for their ranci to investigate the
case. The general opinion is that they
will hide near Cokeviile for a wnile after
eluding the Sheriff's posse.
SAN BERNARDINU'S BIG STORM.
Fuller Reports Show That It Did Con
siderable Damage.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Aug. 17.â
Later and fuller reports show that thÂ«
storm of yesterday was of great extent
and violence. At Victor two houses were
washed away, but no lives were lost. The
roadbed of the Southern California Rail
way was washed out for a considerable
distance and hundreds of feet of the track
were covered with mud and sand.
At Redlands the cemented storm ditches
were damaged to tbe extent of several
thousand dollars. Water flowed through
some of the streets to the depth of nearly
two feet.
The storm was accompanied by hall, the
stones being three-fourths of an inch in
diameter. The wind, ram and hail dam
aged the orange crop, but to what extent
cannot now be ascertained. At Old San
Bernardino a stream of water 150 feet wide
swept through valuable property, doing
great damage to orchards and crops.

GREGORY'S TRIAL
AT WEAVERVILLE
Accused of Participating in
Jack Littlefield's
Murder.
IMPANELING OF JURORS
The Town Is Rapidly Filling Up
With Witnesses and
Talesmen.
SQUADS OF BUGGED COWBOYS
Ride In From the Mountains, Bringing
Blankets, Provisions and Cook
ing Utensils.
\\ EAVERVILLE, Cal., Aue. 17.â The
impaneling of jurors in the case of the
people of California vs. Jo Gregory, ac
cused of participating In the murder and
subsequent hanging of Alfred D. Little
field, better known as Jack Littlefield, on
September 27, 1895, near Round Valley,
in the southeastern portion of Trinity
County, was begun before Judge T. E.
Jones this morning, Hon. C. N Post, Dep
uty Attorney-General, and James W. Bart-
; ett, District Attorney for Trinity County,
acting for the prosecution, and Oregon
Sanders and Rob Fowler for the defense.
In anticipation of difficulty in obtaining
unprejudiced jurors, a venire of seventy
three talesmen was issued, of which Judee
Jones excused fifteen, and from twenty
eight talesmen six were accepted and
sworn at the time of the closing of court â
namely, H. M. Hall, P. H. Bragdon,
Thomas Treloar, P. O. Hennessey, H. T.
Harvey Jr. and J. Bebeau. The balance
are to be selected to-morrow.
A favorite question of the defense seems
to be whether the talesmen would be
shaken in their conviction by the presence
of a weepinjr woman, which from their
resolute appearance seems almost super
fluous. The picturesque figure of Oregon
Sanders, as he rose from his chair and
paced the floor in meditation, was in pleas
ing and artistic grouping with the motley
assemblage of miners, prospectors, lum
bermen and cowboys appareled in overalls
and soft shirts â such an assemblage as
one could not tind outside of a California
mountain town.
Early Sunday evening the witnesses and
jurors began to arrive â tall, stalwart men
of the mountains who have beÂ«n accus
tomed to the handling of a rifle from in
fancy. No disturbance was made upon
the streets, but one instantly felt that a
suppressed feeling of great intensity ex
isted, and knots of from six to a dozen
sun-browned men were to be seen stand
ing on every corner engaged in earnest
conversation.
The event of the day was the arrival of
the witnesses for the prosecution' from
Long Ridge, headed by Yes Palmer, j
mounted upon wiry, active ponies. A 1
caravan of some thirty swarthy moun- j
laineers, men skilled in the use of tbe
lariat and born in the saddle, their legs ,
encased in "shaps," and their white hats
and bucksKin shirts sprinkled with dust |
from the journey, their guns resting on ;
the pommels of the saddles and their
blankets tied behind, wound down
tbe narrow mountain trail and
out upon the highways. They were pre
pared to camp during their stay at
Weaverville, and between them they
drove pack mules laden with tents, cook
ing utensils and great haunches of veni
son. Another party of about twenty wit
nesses will arrive in the same manner
some time to-morrow.
It is expected that the trial of Gregory
will last for two weeks, after which the
cases of Haydon Buck, Lacock, Fred Rad
cliffe and Vinton will be called, each of
whom has demanded a separate trial.
LOS ANGELES WILL HELP
San D.ego to Be Urged as the
Japanese Steamship Line
Terminus.
Success Is Assured if Merchants Can
Guarantee Substantial Return
Cargoes.
Los Akgeles Office of The Call,)
328 South Broadway. â  V
Los Angeles, Cal., Aug. 17. )
The Manufacturers' and Merchants' As
sociation held a meeting this evening
and discussed the question of assisting
toward the selection of San Diego as the
eastern terminus of the new Japanese
steamship line.
Charles Forman of the committee re
ported that President Asano had been
most favorably impressed with the San
Diego harbor, and about the only thing
necessary to secure the selection was the
ability of Southern California merchants
to guarantee the steamship company re
turn cargoes.
Local millers had assured Mr. Forman
that they could readily furnish 500 tons
of flour monthly for the Japan trade, pro
vided the company could give them a
reasonable rate, so as to enable them to
compete with northern mills. .
About 1000 tons of brewing barley.could
also be sent fiom this section as well as
the 500 tons of canned meats which Mr.
Asano had assured him could find a ready
market in Japan. The most necessary
thing to the local people was the assurance
of a Japanese market ' for . their commodi
ties. Mr. Forman urged that an agent be
sent to Japan to establish trade there for
Southern California goods.
K. H. Wade, general manager of the
Southern California Railroad, was called
upon for some advice. ; He said that ' the
success of the movement for San Diego
would of coarse depend on an exchange of
commodities between Southern California
and Japan. He urged the people to make
a concentrated effort and expressed belief
in their ability to succeed. ;.
* Speeches were also ''made *by C. , White
Mortimer, British Vice-Consul, George S.
Matzuma, a Japanese merchant, and J.
R. New berry.

LOS ANGELES ROADS.
Supervisor* and State Commissioner
Maude Discuss the * Subject.'; â¢
LOS ANGELEB, : Cal., Aug. 17.âCom
missioner J. L. Maude of the State Bureau
of Highways met the Board of Supervisors
for the purpose of talking over road mat
ters here to-day. ," :
; ' A great many details of the road , work
of the county were gone ", into ? during :' the
informal discussion.', Mr. J Maude and his
fellow Commissioners have been ani
mated interrogation points for months
past in every county and State, and are
collecting a mass of statistics which will be
utilized in the presentation of a bill at the
next session of the Legislature.
One of the points referred to this morn
ing was guide-posts, and the destructive
ness of the bad boys of the county was al
luded to as an obstacle to maintaining
guide-posts except upon the main roads of
the county.
The irrepressible impulse of boys with
guns to shoot boles through the guide
posts was described and Mr. Hay, in re
sponse to Mr. Maude's inquiry whether a
stringent law with a big penalty wouln't
stop such things, said that he didn't think
it would.
TWO TOUNG MEN DROWNED.
One Goea to the Assistance of the Other
and Both Periah.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 17.â Frank
Sherman, aged 19 years, and Harry Dick
erson, ased 20, were drowned at 10 o'clock
this morning at Asbury station, three
quarters of a mile west of Long Beach,
while bathing in the ocean.
There were two of the Sherman boys
and two of the Dickerson boys camped
near the scene of the accident. At the
time mentioned Frank Sherman and
Harry Dickerson went in for a swim.
They had been in but a short time when
the Dickerson boy heard his companion,
who bad ventured out beyond his depth,
call for help.
He hastened to bis relief, only to be
dragged down under the water, and after
a short struggle they both disappeared
out of sight. The only persons near the
scene were some young girls, who were
unable to render assistance.
The alarm was given, and in a very short
time a searching party put out in a boat,
but up to a late hour the bodies had not
been recovered. The parents of the boys
reside at Eagle Rock, near Pasadena.

STOCKTON RIVALS FIGHT,
Two Men in Love With One
Woman Try to Reach a
Settlement.
The Fair Damsel Tarns the Tide of
Battle by Vigorously Wield-
ing a Knife.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 17.â While the
officers were planning how to prevent the
Maxwell-Rochette fight last night a fistic
encounter took place in an ark back of
Banner Island which was as spirited as
the one that did not eventuate possibly
could have been. The prize was a greater
Incentive to exertion than base lucre, and,
besides, the contestants were not on
friendly terms by any means â in fact, they
bore each other a most unfriendly feeling.
The prize was a woman and the con
testants were rivals for her love.
The men were Frank Keeney, familiarly
known as "Curly-headed Frank," and
Jack Warring. The woman for whom the
men battered each other in order to win
tier affection is a fair damsel who at one
ime waited on the table at the Philadel
phia House. Her name is Delia Colton.
[t appears that Delia was wooed by
Keeney, who enjoyed the pleasure of her
:ompany undisputed by any one until
Warring fell a victim to her alluring
;harms. Then it was that trouble began.
Warring recently had to fto to lone, and
he persuaded the woman to accompany
lim.
She left him at lone and returned to
Stockton. Warring followed and found
3er in the company of Keeney in an ark
5n McLeods Lake. Here he sought to re
tain her affections, but her Stockton
suitor was not to be outdone, and so the
men engaeed in a battle royal yesterday
for the affections of the girl. Keeney was
setting the worst of the encounter, when
the woman for whom they were fighting
rushed at Warring with a laree knife. She
(vas held back by bystanders and the men
were separated.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CA"LL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, 1596.
BROWN'S RETURN
TO CARSON CITY,
Eagerly Awaited by the
Public and Bank
Officials.
DARK RUMORS REVIVED
Hints That the Young Man's
Presence Might Mean a
Sensation.
HOFEB'S INTEBEST IN THE CASE
Desires to Swear to the Complaint in
Order to Set Himself
Right.
CARSON. Nev., Aug. 17.â Ever since
Harry Brown left suddenly for Mexico
there has been a story circulated about
once a week that he was on his way back.
These stories have been told so often that
they have been generally discredited by
the public. Those who claim to be in a
position to know say that letters have been
received from him to the effect that he
will be back on Wednesday. Since his
departure the tongue of rumor has been
pretty busy with the bank affairs, and now
they wag livelier than ever. While the
old bank managers have been claiming
that they are scouring the earth with de
tectives, his friends say that he could have
been found at any time, and that the bank
people did not want him. It is also
claimed that Jake Klein's friends consid
ered that he had been badly done up, and
have induced Brown to return and tell
all he knows about the bank, the mint and
various transactions that he is supposed
to know a good deal about.
It is argued that no one person could
possibly have taken the $68,000 and that
Brown is coming back to admit the taking
of $3000 and say that the disappearance of
the rest of the swag he cannot account for.
Others claim that Brown will get off scott
free on the plea that he merely indulged
in overdrafts, the same as several other
parties did, and that he is no more
criminally responsible than they.
Whether any of these stories are true or
not public curiosity is keenly whetted.
There was a meeting of the bank directors
this morning in reference to the matter.
Evan Williams said that he would swear
to the complaint, but Bob Hofer, the ex
cashier, who was present, said that he had
rather swear to it himself as the public
had placed him under suspicion and he
desired to have an opportunity of proving
that he had no connection whatever with
the matter. It was finally agreed that
Hofer would make the complaint as soon
as Brown arrived and the case would go
to the next Grand Jury.
It appears that the friends and relatives
of Brown have for some time past been
urging him to return and face the music.
He is not anxious to do this, but he has of
late realized that he is a hunted man and
a fugitive from justice, and while it has
been charged that the old bank officials
did not want him bacic it is nevertheless a
fact that they placed descriptions of Brown
and photographs in the hands of Chief
Crowley, who sent duplicates to the detec
tive agencies of all the large cities, and he
assured the bank, people that he would in
due season deliver Brown to them.
It is doubtless the feeling on Brown's
part that he would eventually be arrested
that has induced him to write to his
friends that he was willing to come back
and stand trial. Since the shortage was
discovered the amount ($68,000) has been
made good by outside parties who took
the stock of Williams, Klein and Coffin
for the money they advanced, so that the
loss has actually fallen on these men.
Yesterday Coffin, who had overdrawn
about 110,000, was compelled to turn over
as security his entire interest in his suit
against the Union Mill and Mining Com
pany for professional services in the water
suit on the Carson River. The defendants
are Senator Jones, Congressman New-'
lands, John W. Mackay, Evan Williams
and others. The bank will begin suit at
once against these parties. Every person
who has overdrawn an account at the
bank has been compelled to give full
security by the new board, and not a dol
lar will escape.
SAN BERNARDINU'S OIL WELLS.
Contracts for Sinking Let and Machinery
Arriving.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Aug. 17.â
About three months ago a company was
formed in this city for the purpose of pios
pecting for oil. It was finally decided to
sink a well in San Timoteo Canyon, about
three-fourths of a mile from Bicfcnell sta
tion, on the Southern Pacific Railroad.
There is every surface and topographical
indication that there is oil in that region.
The contract for sinking the well has
been let and the machinery has arrived at
Colton. It will be taken to the canyon
and the work commenced. The contract
ors are to put down the well 1000 feet if
necessary and the hole is to be nine inches
in diameter. An experienced geologist
asserts that there is an oil belt running
from north to south the entire length of
California and he is quite sure that this
southern extremity will in time equal the
Pennsylvania oil regions.

MOSTERET'S FISHING CARNIVAL.
An Italian Captures a Tunny Weighing
â 'â : 650 founds.
MONTEREY, Cal.. Aug. 17.â Giuseppi
Pisani, a fisherman of this city, yesterday
caught a 650- pound tunn y. The fish is the
largest tunny ever taken on the coast.
These fish, which are most frequently
found in the Mediterranean Sea, are now
running in this bay in large schools.
Sea bass have also commenced to run
in large quantities and from two to six
tons are shipped to San Francisco daily.
The salmon have slacked up somewhat,
though the mackerel, smelt and sardines
are still plentiful. There being so many
fish in the bay has caused the whales to
come in. To-morrow the whaling crews
under the respective commands of Cap
tain Schaufele an-d Captain Pedro will be
ordered out. The whalery has been un
dergoing repairs and the whalers con
template a busy season. Nearly 175 boats
go out daiiy for fish.
THE NOGALES TROUBLE,
Three Yaqui Prisoners Brought
in and Fully Identified as
Marauders.
Rumors of Further Arrests and En*
gagements Cannot Be
Verified.
NOGALEB, Ariz., Aug. 17.â The three
Yaqui prisoners brought in last night by
Captain Dodge have been identified as
having taken part in the shooting here on
the 12th. Their names are: Luis Lizo,
Andrez Gonzaleze and Manuel Mesa.
Lizo's name appears on the list of the
twelve who came from Tubae the night
before the battle.
The other two were of the party which
met at Nogales. An investigation will be
held by United States Court Commis
sioner Taylor at this place when the
United States District Attorney arrives.
The report of the arrest of thirty Yaquis
by Captain Boraus has not yet been veri
fied, as he has not yet arrived. A report
circulated that Arizona militiamen and
United States customs guards went to the
Mexican side and engaged the renegades
in a fight on the moruing of the 12th is
not true.
All the militia guns were taken to that
side by the citizens and some militiamen
who went as citizens, but the United
States customs inspectors did not go to
that side at all. They stayed on tbe
American side several hundred feet north
of the line, on the hillside near the United
States Custom-house.
They had orders from Collector Webb to
do no firing unless from across the line,
and tbe inspectors did not shoot until the
Indians opened fire on them as they re
treated over the bill near tbe line.
El Paso papers of the 14th inst.' suggest
that the militiamen and customs guard be
let out and mure sensible men put in their
places. The citizens are very indignant at
the items, as they consider the boys acted
coolly and bravely.
ARCHIBALD LEITCH DEAD.
A Pioneer and One of the Moat Enter-
prising Men in the State.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 17.â Archibald
Leitch, ex-Supervisor, died at 10 o'clock
last night at his home in this city at the
corner of California and Flora streets.
Death resulted from a bowel complaint,
which bad existed only for a few days.
With the passing of Mr. Leitch, Stock
ton, with the interior of the State, loses
one of its most progressive and successful
men of affairs. His iife in this State was
as varied as that of the typical pioneer,
and he had not a little adventure. He
was born in Robinson County, North
Carolina, the son of a tiller of the soil.
He was 74 four years old at the time of
his death. He learned tbe blacksmith's
trade and worked at the forge a great part
of his life. In 1849 he started for Califor
nia from Mississippi, whither he bad re
moved. He and nine others came here
overland, following the Santa Fe trail into
Los Angeles and thence coming up along
the coast through Pacheco Pass to this
country.
Deceased was a member of the Pioneers,
of which society he was once president;
also of Morning Star Lodge. F. and A.

OPENED ANOTHER MAN'S MAIL.
C. Janaen, Who Claim* to Have Been
Duped, I* in Trouble.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.', Aug. 17.â Last
Saturday niÃht Deputy United States
Marshal Oaks arrested C. Yansen of this
city. The complaint came from El Paso,
Texas, and charged him with opening
mall not addressed to him.
The complaint was issued in tbe name
of Berger, a man who gained some un
savory notoriety in this section last year.
According to the jail officials, Yan
sen is a hard - working machinist.
It is alleged, while he was at
woric last year he was approached
by Bereer, who told him a tale of woe and
asked him for assistance, averring that he
would make him superintendent of a mine
which he possessed in Mexico. Yansen
was taken in by these promises and helped
Berger to $200. It was then discovered
that the mine was a myth. For this he
was taken to Ei Paso.
When Berger left he told Yansen thst
he might open his letters. This, at least,
is what they say at the jaiL Yansnn did
open them, after which he forwarded
them to the man at Ei Paso, who it is now
supposed has had Yansen arrested purely
out of a spirit of malice. The requisition
from Texas will be here in a few days.

POLITICS IN THE
GOLDEN STATE.
Everything Points to a
Great Victory for
McKinley.
HARRIS IS CONVERTED.
Democratic Deadlock in the Sixth
Congressional District
Unbroken.
EQUAL SUFFRAGE IN MADERA
Colonel Henry G. Shaw Opens the Re
publican Campaign in Tuol
umns County.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 17. -The ac
tion of Will A. Harris in taking a stand
for sound money and placing himself at
the disposal of the local Republican man
agers is regarded as of the greatest politi
cal importance. Harris is a Southern
Democrat of the old school and vas never
known to waver heretofore in his devotion
to his party. He is conceded to be one of
the ablest speakers in the State and a law
yer of eminent ability and high character.
His voice will be heard during the cam
paign in many of the 'leading cities of
California. His first speech of the cam
paign will be made in Music Hall, this
city, next Saturday evening to the First
Voters' Sound-money Club.
At Republican State and Congressional
headquarters in the Westminster it was
learned this morning that encouraging
letters have been received from Santa
Barbara that the silver craze is on the
wane throughout that county, that Re
publicans are vigorously and aggressively
in line and many Democrats are announc
ing themselves for sound money and good
government. Reports from all parts of
this Congressional district commend the
open and manly stand taken by Congress
man McLachlan in the opening of the
campaign. The organization of Republi
can clubs is progressing rapidly under the
auspices of the National Republican
League.
The Democratic Congressional deadlook
in the Sixth District continues. At an ad
journed session of the convention thia
afternoon four ballots were had without a
nomination, the vote in each instance be
ing thirty-six for Rose and the same num
ber for ration. A recess was then taken
to 8 o'clock this evening, when three more
ballots were had, with the same result.
Thia lacks one vote only of being
a full delegation, and indicates how
closely the lines are drawn. The
absent vote belongs to General
C. F. A. Last, who not only declines to at
tend the sessions of the convention, but
refuses to eive his proxy to any one
else. His vote or proxy would make a
tie impossible, since with it 73 is the whole
number. The remarkable part of to-day's
proceedings, is that while changes have
taken place equivalent to a gain of four
votes for each candidate since the sessions
at Ventura, they equalize each other, leav
ing the result as before, a tie. After the
ballots this evening and some display of
oratorical pyrotechnics from both sides,
another recess was taken until 11 a. m. to
morrow.
FIRST BLOOR IN TUOLUMNE.
Opening of the Republican Campaign bt/
Colonel Shnu>.
80N0RA, Cal., Aug. 17.â The Republi
can campaign in Tuolumne County was
opened here to-night by Colonel Henry G.
Shaw of Stockton, who spoke to a large
audience upon the monetary plank of the
Republican National platform. His
speech was very favorably received, his
manner and methods of illustration being
something unique. With his parity um
brella and shears he created a decided
sensation amoner the miners, as with them
he showed how there would be an enor
mous contraction of the volume of money
instead of an expansion in case the Demo
cratic-Populist doctrine of free coinage
prevailed.
The free coinage of silver at a ratio of
16 to 1, with silver bullion selling below
that ratio, meant the non-coinage of gold,
and that of course was nothing but silver
monometallism. The only practical bi
metallism to-day, he said, was where
every nation using both gold and silver as
money Kept the coinage of silver under
government control until there was a gen
eral concert of action. Such a policy was
in the interest of all the people. It kept
silver at a parity with gold, and made j
every dollar in circulation as good as gold. 1
The legalized use of gold and silver in
the currency of a country at a fixed rela
tive value is true bimetallism. With half
of our metallic money to-day in silver and
over four hundred millions of it full legal
tender in usa as a medium of exchange
there was no foundation for the charge
that the Republican party was hostile to
silver. Both the silver and paper now
used as current money in the world op
erated on prices just as much as gold did.
Colonel Shaw exploded, one after an
other, all the monetary fallacies of the
silverites and said they were the offspring
of surmises, assumptions, vagaries and
theories, while the Republican argument
for sound money was drawn from the uni
versal experience of mankind, the orderly
development of trade and commerce and
the maintenance of public and private
credit. Hu accused the Populists of in
consistency in clamoring for the control
by the Government of railroads and tele
graphs and nearly everything else having
a public nse, and at the same agitating for
private control of the mints.
The colonel said the gold miners of
California had a deep interest in settling
this great question rlehtly. Free coinage
meant a premium on gold, but this did
not mean that the miners would get any
more for their gold than they now re
ceived. With silver as a sole monetary
basis the goW miners would hold out their
gold for the true valuation of this metal,
and with Californians compelled to buy
$40,000,000 of gold every year to liquidate
interest charges upon specific contracts
and for taxation, a popular storm of in
dignation would break upon the heads of
the men who had invested their capital
and energies In the development of the
gold mines of California and then would
come their turn to be vindictively assailed
by the calamity howlers, the discontented,
the theorists and the political adventurers
in every party.
Colonel Shaw was frequently interrupted
by applause and his closing plea for
McKiriiÂ«y, protection, sound money and
prosperity was very heartily applauded.
He will talk daring the week in Angels
Camp, San Andreas and other mining
towns on the mother lode.

SANTA BARBARA NEWS,
Unique and Interesting Contract
Filed in the Recorder's
Office.
John Resigh Undertakes a Tunneling
Project Which Promises Great
Results in Water.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Aug. 17.â A
unique and interesting contract has been
filed in the County Recorder's office, by
which John Rfisigh of this place agrees to
drive a 300-foot tunnel into the hills in
certain lands in township 4 north, range
26 west, the compensation to be a certain
share of the possible water flow developed
in driving the tunnel. The object of this
tunnel is water development, Mr. Resigh
being an old miner and the contractor on
the Barker tunnel in Cold Spring Canyon,
which has contributed so materially to
ward the water supply of the valley.
Mr. Axtell's ranch lies upon the line of
the mountain boulevard and in a gulch
upon it are fine springs situated in a plum
colored sandstone which experts declare
to be the water-bearing rock of this region
and it is expected that it will develop
large quantities of water if penetrated.
The point where operations will begin is
some thousand feet above the valley and
the finding of water in quantity at this
j elevation would be of inestimable value.
A SUGGEST IVE FIND.
Shoe* of a Misting Chinaman Picked Up
on a Wharf.
BANTA BARBARA, Cal., Ang. 17.â
Charles Haines, a truckman, this morn
ing made a grewsome discovery in the
shape of a pair of Chinese shoes carefully
placed near the outer edge at the extreme
end of the wharf. These shoes have been
identified as belonging to one Sam Lee, an
employed of J. A. Blood at Carpinteria.
Sam Lee was in town yesterday and cashed
a check for $10. since which time he has
not been seen by any of his countrymen.
There is yet no positive proof beyond the
mute testimony of the shoes that he is
not back In Carpinteria, but the wharf is
thronged with Chinamen watching for
his remains.

FERNDALE'S NEW
CATHOLIC CHURCH,
Bishop Grace Opens and
Dedicates the Beautiful
Edifice.
IMPRESSIVE SERVICES.
The Fine Structure Packed to
the Doors, While Hundreds
Stand Outside.
TRIBUTE TO FATHER NUGENT.
To the Pastor's Efforts Is Da? the
Erection of This Handsome Place
of Worship.
EUREKA, Cal., Aug. 17.â The beauti
ful new Catholic church at Ferndale was
opened and dedicated to-day by Right
Rev. T. Grace D. D., Bishop of Sacra
mento. The ceremony was most solemn
and impressive. Hish mass was cele
brated at 11 o'clock, at which the pastor,
Rev. T. Nugent, was assisted by Rev. H.
P. Wyman and Rev. A. 11. Clark, Paulist
fathers from San Francisco.
The sacred edifice wts crowded to the
doors, visitors from Euieka, Rohnerville
and surrounding towns being in attend
ance. All tbe available space in the
church was filled and hundreds of people
were unable to gain admittance. The new
church is of the Gothic style of architec
ture, admirable in proportion, beautiful
in desisrn and cost many thousands of dol
lars. It stands as a monument to tbe zeal
of the pastor, Rev. Thomas Nueent, and
is a credit to the people of the parish, who
can congratulate themselves on the pos
session of a magnificent church entirely
free from debt.
The town of Ferndale, the headquarters
of the parish, is situated in the richest
portion of the Eel River Valley. Its citi
zens are hospitable and liberal and all
shades of religions belief shared with their
Catholic brethren to-day in celebrating
this event, the dedication of an edifice to
the service of God.
The sermon was delivered by Rev.
Father Wyman of San Francisco. This
gentleman needs no introduction to the
people of California. His discourse was
able, eloquent and appropriate, and held
the audience spellbound to tbe close.
The music was rendered by St. Ber
nard's choir of Eureka, under the direction
of Miss Clara Dawson, the organist, with
the assistance of some of the foremost vo
calists of this county. Following were the
singers : Sopranosâ Misses Buhne and Bell
and Mrs.Callagrhan; contraltos â Mesdamcs
M. Christie, J. P. Monroe and Miss Schal
lert; tenors â Messrs. N. McMillan, Perry
and H. Deering; bassos â Messrs, J. P.
Monroe, W. Decantillon and Belcher.
Millard's beautiful mass in G was never
more artistically sune.
The magnificent new edifice could not
have been opened under circumstances
more favorable. The presence of his Lord
ship, Bishop Grace of Sacramento, the
opening of a mission by Rev. Fathers
Wyman and CJtrk of the Panlist order,
and the celestial strains pealing forth from
the orean loft, all tended to make the oc
casion imposing and impressive and a fit
ting presentation of a house of worship
to God.
The pastor of this thriving congrega
tion, Rev. Thomas Nugent, assumed man
agement of the Ferndale parish about
three years ago. He has already dem
onstrated his executive ability as a
financier by erecting and freeing from
debt the most beautiful house of worship
in this part of Humboldt County and a
church that in point of style, artistic dec
oration and general finish will compare
favorably with the most pretentious sacred
edifices of this character in Northern Cal
ifornia. Father Nugent's fame, however,
does not rest alone in his ability to build
up and pay for this magnificent temple,
dedicated to-day to God's service. He is
withal an orator of recognized ability, a
logical reasoner, a scholar whose talents
and learning have more than once made
him the champion of his people â a
patriotic American citizen who only asks
for that boon of political and religious
freedom which is the foundation-stone of
our Republic's greatness and grandeur.

SAN JOSE'S COURT
The Offenses Range From
Double Murder to
Petty Theft.
AN OCTET OF PRISONERS
Harvey Allender's Arraignment
Fills the Courtroom With
Spectators.
TRIO OF BOLD HIGHBINDERS.
Ex-Convicts, Morphine Fiends, Sn?ak
Thieves and a Rancher in the
Motley Group.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 17.â This was
criminal day in Judge Lorigan's court,
and the octet arraigned before the bar of
justice included all classes of criminals
Irom an alleged double murderer to a
I>etty thief.
The fact that Harvey Allender was to be
arraigned upon the charges of murdering
Wally Feilner and Venanz Crosetti on
Sunday, August 9, filled the courtroom
with spectators. Allender was the neatest
appearing of the batch of offenders and
showed no signs of worry or excitement.
He was arraigned on the two charges and
given until Friday to plead.
Herbert Kelley, a morphine fiend,
pleaded guilty to two charees of burglary
in the second degree. Kelley robbed the
Independent mill and the Brown ware
house. At the latter place his loot con
sisted of about $300 worth of household
goods.
isadore Salazar, an ex-convict, pleaded
guilty to a charge of attempt to commit
murder, but pleaded not guilty to the
prior conviction placed against him. On
the night of June 21, during a drunken
row, he made a murderous assault upon
John Nelson with a knife. The latter re
ceived several bad wounds about the head
and neck.
A trio of Chinese highbinders â Ah Louie
Young, See Quon and Ah Fong Gun â were
next called up to answer to a charge of
rob Ding Lee Wing, a resident of Sixth
street, Chinatown, of $264 on July 13.
They will plead August 21.
Antonio Machado, a Milpitas rancher
who attached a neighbor with a pitchfork
during a row over a water right, was ar
raigned on a charge of assault to murder.
His case was also continued to Septem
ber 7.
The case of Harry Everett, charged with
receiving and selling goods stolen by Her
bert Kelley, was called, and he was given
until the same time as the others to plead.
Killed an Immense Wildcat. i
SAN JOSE. Cal., Aug. 17.â Charles A.
Main, a wood-dealer of this city, killed an
immense wildcat on Bear Creek, in the
Santa Cruz Mountains, yesterday. The
animal weighed twenty -one pounds and
had claws an inch lone. It is one of the
largest ever killed in that vicinity. Milton
Main, a 12-year-old boy, was with his
father, and when he approached the ani
mal after it had been snot, the cat started
to attack the boy, but a well-directed shot
ended its life.

SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 17.â At a joint

that the Agricultural Society was to have
full control of the races and livestock ex
hibit at the coming fair, while the Board
of Trade will have charge of the agricult

exhibitors instead of cash prizes.

TRUCKEE, Cal., Aug. 17.â Truckee is
to-day one of the few towns in the land
that is not depressed by "hard times."
Business men are prosperous; laboring
men are busy and contented.
In a few days the Sierra Nevada Wood
and Lumber Company will have its road
completed to the mili site, and soon after
its mill will be finished. Employment
will be provided for a great many more
hands.
The lumbering resources hereabout are
tm limited.
One has to go but a short distance from
town to see miles and miles of as fine
sugar pine, yellow pine, fir and SDruce
tiniber as ever grew. It has only been
within tbe paÂ«t few years that this inter
est has received the attention due it.
The railroad was a great undertaking.
Capital long ago conceived the idea of
opening the new lumber Mecca, but tim
idity predominated, and the same moun
tain might have for years been inaccessible
were it not for the venture of the Sierra
Company.
Garratt Write* from Lot Angelet.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Aug. 17.â James E.
Garratt, the Ensenada gold bar thief, was
in Los Angeles on Friday last, a letter
having been received here by A. E. Wil
liams, a former friend of Garratt, asking
that Garratt's mail be forwarded in care
of Mrs. E. Cargill, 402 Banchet street, Los
Angeles, and that any received later be
returned to the dead letter office.
Garratt intimates that he will take his
departure for distant parts. When re
leased at Ensenada last Wednesday by
the officials on instructions from the City
of Mexico, he endeavored to procure food
from former friends, but was refused and
shunned on all sides. He started to waik
to San Diego, but was given a ride on the
stage and reached Los Angeles, 223 miles
distant, in two days. He has about $500
of his own money.

evil. With the money the gypsy fled to

with her. She was arrested here to-day
by Chief of Police Guevin of Great Falls
and taken back to Montana.

FLAGG SALUTED
BY THE FACULTY.
Highly Praised in a Me
moriol to the Re
gents.
IS LEARNED BUT SH7.
Inference That Dear Old Bun
nell Was a Back Num
ber.
NOT UP TO MODERN METHODS.
His Gre?k Was Good Enough for Fred
Henshaw, Alex Morrison and
Ryland Wallace.
The resolution to dismiss Professor
Flagg, which failed of adoption by one
vote at the meeting of the University Re
gents last Tuesday, has been the talk of
the town of Berkeley ever since. It is
claimed by Professor Flagg's friends, who
seem to be rallying to his support, that
much was said i.i commendation of his
capability as a teacher which did not ap
pear in The Call's report of the executive
session.
The records plainly show that Professor
Flagg's earnest supporter, President Kel
logg, suggested the secret session, and the
fact that the eulogies of Flagg were not
mentioned must be due to President Kel-
Joeg's weakness for executive meetings.
On more than one occasion Governor
Budd has plainly signined his impatience
with this fashion of closing the doors and
excluding outsiders whenever important
subjects touching the management of the
university came up for consideration;
but still the Regents are shy of public
comment.
The fact is now clearly demonstrated
that there is among the faculty a Flagg
faction as well as a Bunnell faction. In
the faculty, as in the Board of Regents,
the factions may be of equal strength.
It is said by the champions of Professor
Flagg that he is a man of great learning
in Greek and Latin, but that his transcen
dent genius in the field of knowledge is
dwarfed by over-mastering diffidence and
shyness. He is accredited with a deep
and profound sense of gratitude, and as
be was once placed under great obligation
to Professor Bunnell the sense of this debt
oppressed him, and he suffered great
worry and sore trial rather than murmur
against his benefactor.
It is admitted that Professor Bunnell
did render Professor Flagg a great service;
that he did extend the hospitality of his
home, which Professor Flngg accepted,
but it is said further that Professor Bun
nell, as a compensation for his kindness,
exacted an allegiance from Professor
Flatrg, and that these exactions were
pressed so far that the obligations of grati
tude were more than canceled.
So far did Bunnell go in demanding rec
ognition for what he had done in Flagg's
behalf that he insisted that the latter l

should cast his vote in the faculty as
Bunnell desired, although the Flagg in
tellect and conscience, breaking away
from the fetters of shyness and gratitude,
impelled him to vote contrary to Bun
nell's demand. No longer able" to suffer
this great wrong in silence he sought the
advice of a well-known literary lady, and
told her of his mental distressâ his sense
of gratitude for favors bestowed by Bun
nell and his sense ot duty to the faculty
and to the "high ideals," as Reinstein
would say of the university. Bhe, a
woman of sound judgment, quick percep
tions and alert intellect, recommended
emancipation, the assertion of the Flagg
independence, and the casting of the Flagg
vote in the faculty according to the sacred
and enlightened conscience of the Flagg
man.
It seems that Professor Flagg while suf
fering in silence was recruiting some
friends in the faculty. His BkiU, his
methods and general style of imparting
instruction in Greek arrested the admiring
attention of his brother professors. His
methods were so modern and effective
and so much superior to those employed
for f even teen years by dear old Bunnell
that not only the faculty but the Regents
Degan to rally round the Flagg.
In the course of time Professor Bunnell
received a letter dictated by the advisory
committew, Regents Marye, Stebbins and
Columbuj Bartlett. The* exact language
of the letter cannot be quoted now, but
surely it was the desire that Bunnell
should give an example of one of the
noblest of Christian virtues â the virtue of
resignation. Professor Bunnell was sur
prised. Even the stanchest supporters of
Flagg concede that Bunnell was surprised.
The faculty, if compelled to take sides
openly, would admit that he was sur
prised. Bafore the effect of the surprise
had vanished Professor Bunnell went to
President Kellogg to ascertain what in
duced the Regents to ask for the resigna
tion. Then and there the old professor
heard that he was "not sufficient" in
Greek. He began to count his eminent
graduates, and since has been counting
them. It is conceded now by Flagg's ad
miring friends that lovely old Bunnell did
teach Greek to the delieht and satisfac
tion of Fred Henshaw. Alex Morrison and
Ryland Wallace, but not such Greek as
would satisfy the grasping intellects of
modern up-to-date graduates.
It is said of Professor Flagg that he has
acquired a prodigous store of Greeki lore,
and independent of his acquisitions he in
herited more Greek than Bunnell ever
acquired. But Greek aside, other things
carried weight, Bunnell was told by the
president that discourteous treatment of
Professor Flagg was one reason why the
resignation was suggested. So now Bun
nell is out and Fiagg is in. Judge Wallace
wants the position reversed; President
Kellogg does not want the present status
disturbed.
The faculty is now in the fight. A
memorial concerning Professor Flagg has
been presented to the Regents. It speaks
of Flagg as without question one of the
ablest and most distinguished classical
scholars in this county, and mentions
that his works are widely known and
valued by all comoetent scholars and
used in the leading universities of the
country. "His name adds to the fame of
our university wherever classical scholar
ship is respected, and his dismissal would
be a serious blow to its reputation."
His qualities as a teacher are praised,
and it is then said emphatically that
"after long acquaintance we know him to
be a rarely gifted man of letters and a
gentleman of unquestionable honor, and
we are sure that his conduct since he
came among us is open to no censure."
The memorial is signed by twenty-three
professors, all who had returned from
vacation to Berkeley when it was circu
lated. Professors Le Conte, Moses, Soule,
Brown and Armes were inaccessible. It is
said that Le Conte and Brown would have
signed.
Yesterday The Call sought to obtain
from Horace Davis, ex-president of the
university, an expression of opinion as to
the relative merits of Bunnell and Flagg.
Mr. Davis' remarks were so brief that the
services of a stenographer were not re
quired to record them. He said:
"I am not a Regent oi the university and

I decline to make any statement pertain
ing to this controversy."
Then he was asked if he had, while presi
dent of the university, received any com
plaint against Professor Bunnell for lack
of efficiency in Greek.
Mr. Davis replied : ''I knew Bunnell and
I knew Flagg, and I have resolved to keep
out of this controversy. You had better
ask President Kellogg about Bunnell."
BENNETT'S SETBACK.
Mo New Trial for the Former Secretary
of the Society for the Suppresion
of Vice.
It now looks as though Charles R. Ben
nett, former secretary of the Society for
the Suppression of Vice, would have to
pay the penalty for hi 3 attempt upon the
life of George Gray on the 28th of July,
1894. The Supreme Court has reversed
the Superior Court's order granting Ben
nett a new trial, Justice Garoutte in 'a
rather caustic decision saying: "The law's
methods must be pursued by him who
seeks the protection of the law."
It will be remembered that Bennett was
charged with having disgraced a daughter
of Gray. The father's indignation caused
him to reproach Bennett in the bitterest
terms when the two men fell foul of each
other on one of the Oakland trains shortly
after the scandal became public. Bennett
shot at Gray, but rai3sed his aim.' The
charge against the former custodian ol
the public morals was assault to commit
murder, whicb, after a long trial, resulted
in his conviction of assault with a deadly
weapon. He asked and obtained a new
trial, but fared even worse, the jury find
ing him euilty of assault to commit mur
der. Bennett tnen appealed for another
new trial on the ground of having been
twice la jeopardy. This proceeding the
Supreme Court designates as a sort of
juggling with justice, and the order grant
ing a new trial is reversed.

ANOTHER AM YNDED CONTEST.
Judge Paterson Will Have to File One
in the Fair Case.
Judge Slack's decision as to the standing
of Judge Van R.Paterson in the Fair litiga
tion was not rendered yesterday, as was
expected. Instead it was found that a
flaw existed in the contest, and so the
matter went over again. It is, however,
expected that on Monday next, when the
case will be taken up, all obstacles to an
immediate hearing will have been cleared
away.
Judge Slack sustained the demurrer in
terposed to the contest of Judge Paterson,
in behalf of Herman Oelnchs Jr. and other
minor heirs of James G. Fair, to the will
of September 24. He said that the con
test failed to show, as it should to be
legal, that the contestants have a greater
interest under the will of September 21
than under that of September 24.
Judge Pat rson announced that he ex
pected this decision and had already
begun the preparation of an amended con
test, which would be ready in two days.
Attorney C. T. Wheeler said that if the
contest is ready in that time and he de
cides to file a demurrer thereto, he will
file it at once, so that the entire matter
will be ready for decision on Monday
whea the case comes up.
Threats to Kill.
T. Picton, manager for E. A. Harris, livery
stables, 807 Montgomery street, swore to a
complaint in Judge Joachimsen's court yester
day charging John Brown, a digcharged sta
bleman, with threats to kill. Picton said that
Brown approached him yesterday morning
with an open knife in his hand and said he
would do him up. Brown also told some peo
ple that he would lay for Picton while on his
way home at night and kill him.
Malefactors Convicted.
John Williams, alias John Haulon, was yes
terday convicted of burglary in Judge Belcher's
court. He will be sentenced on Saturday.
John Carr was found guilty of assault with a
deadly weapon. He tried to kill James RUey
with a knife. He will be sentenced by Judge
Baurs on Aug ust 22.

of their treatment was in all cases in ac

school. She stated that on the occasion of
lectures there has been an average attend

young m n are studiously preparing for
Christian work.
On motion, a committee, consisting of
Revs. C. M. Hill, S. C. Keetch and H. L.
Dietz, was appointed to arrange for the
holding of a religious conference in the
month of September and to prepare a pro
gramme for such occasion.
Dr. Sunderland made a very full and
pleasing address on the late Baptist anni
versaries held in Asbury Park.
The resignation of Rev, W. T, Jordan,
pastor of the Alameda Baptist Church,
which was sent in last week, was accepted.
The resignation was caused by ill health,
which the ailing pastor is endeavoring to
improve at present by a sojourn in the
mountains of Glenn County.
The Baptist Tabernacle Church of San
Jose has secured the services of Rev. S. T.
Young of Moline, 111., who is expected
there in September. Dr. Young is con
sidered one of the ablest wearers of the
cloth in the West, has an excellent repu
tation as a man of eloquence and has been
very successful as an organizer.
The former pastor of the church was
Rev. F. T. Mitchell, who was called to
Calvary Baptist Church in Sacramento in
May.
It has been decided to hold the Baptist
State Conference at Twin Lakes, Santa
Cruz. It will open next Tuesday week
and wiil continue till the following Sun
day night Among the subjects discussed
will be the State, foreign and home mis
sions, collie education, religions litera
ture and -undayschool work. One day
will be en- irely devoted to the Women's
Home Missionary Society and one to the
Baptist Historical Society.

the Presbyterian ministers was a paper on
"Some of the Spiritual Needs of the
Church, " by Rev. Dr. F. H. Foster. The
paper was introduced with the statement
that the greatest need of the church to-day
is more religion. The vital questions, in
tne essayist's opinion, are: "At what
points are our religious lives defective,
and what is necessary to enlarge them?"
The first point to which Dr. Foster drew
attention is right living. He did not be
lieve that being a member of a churcn
could be taken as indicative of reliability
in business men. Neither did he believe
the church is making the impression of
moral earnesness and seli-consistent
fidelity to principle she should.
"The present decline calls for more
earnest preaching of plain duty," he de
clared. "What is wanted is God in the
soul ; hence, God must be in the preach
ing. Tne effect of pulpit utterances on
the hearer depends on tne type of piety
cherished in the church. Our preaching
is largely topical â we depend too much on
the Sunday-school and not enough on the
pulpit."
The second point the writer made was
in reference to the attitude the church
should maintain toward the world.
"There is a very strone tendency," he
asserted, "to regard the civilization of the
nineteenth century with a complacence
which overlooks its defects and invests it
with an altogether ideal quality. Yet in
many respects it is far from being what
the Christian ideal demands."
Continuing, Dr. Foster spoke of warfare
and the deadly weapons of late invention,
deprecating the awful carnage resulting
from their use.
In discussing the paper Dr. Minton said
he considered latter-day methods of war
fare less cruel than the ancient methods
because wars must perforce end more
quickly.
Dr. Frazer, Dr. Alexander, Dr. Mathena,
Rev. J. B. Warren and Rev. F. H. Brush
aUo spoke to the question. Dr. Mathena
thought preachers would do better if they
would only keep their eyes off their
salaries.
At the Congregational Morning Club
Professor George P. Mooar, D.D., read a
paper on "The Mission of Congregation
alism in the Development of Mankind."
He said sometimes men were accustomed
to talk as if there were a Congregational
polity without the gospel. If so, he
asserted, it would only bear a facial re
semblanceâit would not be the heroic,
the genuine product.
The Christian ministers failed to appear
in iorce, and an adjournment was taken
without transacting any business.
The Methodist ministers met at the
Fred Finch Orphanage in Fruitvale.

In compliance with numberless petitions

whose occupations at home or at work

men who are in hearty sympathy with
the movement have not been at the rooms
for the same reason. Now, however, this
lack in the otherwise iieriectly organized
plan of the woman suffrage work in this
City is to be remedied, and the receptions

cause.
The first and third Thursdays in each
month have been fixed upon for the even
ing at home. The receptions will open at
8 o'clock and close at 10. though if when
the curfew rings some Philistine should
be just undergoing the throes of conver
sion, the hour would doubtless be ex
tended until such time as the brand from
the burning could be safely corralled and
tagged with the pretty badge which only a
champion of woman suffrage may wear.
The ladies of the State Central Committee
will conduct the receptions. Miss Mary
E. Hay, the State organizer and lady chair
man, will be the hostess par excellence,
though she will have to contend in the
role of "everybody's favorite" with no less
an adversary than Miss Susan B. Anthony.
Mrs. A. A. Sargent and Mrs. Austin
Sperry will with sweet patience try to talk
reason to any chance anti-suffragist who
may heed the cordial invitation which the
committee extends to folks of that ilu;
Mrs. John F. Swift will crush the more
obstreperous scouts of the enemy under
tons of hard and weighty argument, while
Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Blinn will charm
voters into the ranks before they can tell
"where they are at."
The bureau is getting out five new leaf
lets, wnich will be distributed by the
thousand. One will answer the argument,
so-called, that women should not vote
because they cannot tight; another will
deal with the desolate, neglected home of
the horrid voting woman so eloquently
described by an ti-suff racists; a third will
treat of suffrage as a boon to working
women, while the other two are to con
tain brief opinions by eminent jurists and
men in public life.
Mrs. Emma B. Sweet, Miss Anthony's
private secretary, left yesterday morning
for Stockton, where in* the afternoon she
addressed a mass-meeting in the pavilion,
under the auspices of the San Joaquin
County Equal Suffrage Club. She will get
the precinct club work of the county into
shape, proceeding thence to San Jose for
the purpose of inaugurating a similar
work in Santa Clara County.
Reports from Oakland and Los Angeles
aremostencouraging. The|noble workers in
these two great centers of culture and com
merce seem to be working miracies in aid
of the cause. Woman suffrage has become
quite tbe thing in both cities, while har
mony and efficiency would seem to be the
watchwords of the campaign.
BURR'S INDIGNANT REPLY.
Scores the Son of Sarah Jonkg for an
Attack on His Mother.
B. F. Buhr, wno is named as executor
of the will of Sarah Jenks, has iiied an
answer to the contest of Walter JenKs, a
son of tne testatrix, who lives in London,
England. *
In the son's contest of his mother's will
it is|alleged that Buhr is a gambler and a
"person of uncertain position in society,"
and that he resided in the house of, was
unduly intimato with and unduly influ
enced "the deceased.
Buhr, in his answer, while acknowledg
ing that be has been a shceiwnter in the
employ of a bookmaker, denies that be is
a gambler or that his living is dependant
upon the uncertainties of any gambling
game. As to the charges of undue inti
macy with Mrs. Jenks Buhr says he de
clines to discuss such a matter, and that
if the son sees fit to make charges against
his dead mother over which, even if trne,
he should attempt to throw a veil he tor
one will not be a party to such an un

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION
and PROSPERITY.
FOB PRESIDENTâ
WILLIAM HcSINLEY, of Oblo
OR vicÃ-PRiaiiDEjnrâ
GARRET A. EOBART, of New Jersej
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3, 1890.
The issue is prosperity and McKinley is
the man.
It is the Democratic record that kills the
Democratic promise.
About the only thing local Democracy
can organize is a row.
There are no thorns in the crown of pro
tection and prosperity.
Republican harmony is the popular
music with the masses.
Bryan wants to try it on the New Yorkers
again and rub it in hard.
Democrats are none too good to bunko
the Populists, but they are not smart
enough.
The deeds of the boy soldier speak a
nobler patriotism than tbe words of the
boy orator.
Join a Kepublican club if you wish to
keep up with the procession and enjoy
the campaign.
Bryan has not yet accepted the Populist
platform, and no good Populist has yet
accepted Bryan.
About all the running Democratic can
didates will do this year will be done in
dodging the tariff.
The Sewail and Watson comedy will
probably run all through the play and
bave a part in the climax.
The Admission day festival at Stockton
is intended to break the record, and Stock
ton can be counted on to do it.
If there is any way for a Democrat to
dodge the deficit tariff the Cleveland Ad
ministration would like to know it.
Talk money and Democracy has the
nerve to talc back, but say something
about the tariff and it begins to squeal at
once.
Four years ago the biggest Democrats
in the country were Cleveland, Hill,
Whitney and Carlisle, but where are they
now?
The deficit in the National revenue
caused by the Democratic tariff is large,
but that caused in the incomes of the peo
ple is fully ten times greater.
If after the experience of the last three
years tbe people of this country should be
rash enough to try another experiment
with Democracy they will deserve p.ll they
get.
McKinley represents the heroic patriot
ism of the war aud the patriotic states
manship of peace, while Bryan represents
nothing but a loose tongue and an easy
gesture.
"By far the greatest injury resulting
, from the free coinage of silver will fall on
workingmen," says Senator Sherman, and
every intelligent workingmau knows that
to be true.
Day by day the people move toward tbe
soldier candidate like an army with ban
ners, while Bryan swings around the
country and tries to attract the attention
of the stragglers.
The Republican party is opposed to ex
posing American workmgmen to tbe com
petition of European labor, and it is also
opposed to any scheme for paying them in
Mexlcanized money.
When it comes to enterprise or festivals
Stockton ceases to be a slough city. She
puts herself on rising ground on those
occasions and looms up like a metropolis
on a heaven-kissing hill.
When a man is out of tmployment the
first issue before him is to find work and
wages, and when a Nation is running into
debt the firat duty of statesmen is to pro
vide it with an adequate revenue.
By the election of McKinley the people
of this country will get work under a pro
tective tariff and free silver on a system of
international bimetallism ; but the elec
tion of Bryan would mean silent mills,
idle workmen and silver monometallism.
There is a weighty truth in SenatorFora
ker's saying that the attack on the Su
preme Conrt in the Chicago platform "is
enough in itself, if it stood alone, to con
demn the party that would adopt it and
defeat the men who would approve and
stand upon it before the people."
Not even during the war was the Demo
cratic party more discredited than now.
Its ablest leaders and newspapers have
abandoned it and all its conservative mem
bers a** deserting it. On the Chicago plat
form not one single eminent Democrat
stands, and all that is left of the party is
a nume that no one is proud of and a
record that ao one defends.
A GAME OF DECEIT.
Ever since its organization the Demo
cratic party has advocated free interna
tional trade and the single gold standard
for tbe Nation's monetary system. Not a
prominent Democrat in all tbe history of
I the party ever advocated the double stand
ard, or bimetallism, until a few years ago.
In 1877 Bland tried to change the policy
of tbe party on the silver question, but
practically all the Democratic members of
Congress voted against his bill. He then
compromised by accepting tbe Allison-
Bland scheme. But Bland kept hammer
ing for the free and unlimited coinage of
silver until his district, which was largely.
Democratic, turned him down, and he is
still turned down.
It was not until Bryan started out in
1893 as the champion of free silver that a
prominent Democrat undertook to make
bimetallism a National issue for tbat
party, and the reason why he did is very
plain. Bryan had made some reputation
in Congress by declarine, "I am for free
wool." "A sugar bounty is no better than
highway robbery." "I want free trade
pure and simple." "I want the Govern
ment to raise money for its expenses by
income and excise taxes." Why did Mr.
Bryan so suddenly drop the tariff question
and champion free silver coinage? The
reason is plain. Early in its operation the
Wilton-Gorman tariff act demonstrated
that it would close every industrial plant
in the country and inaugurate such a
business panic as the people never before
were afflicted with, and Mr. Bryan was
smart enough to see that it was necessary
to divert public attention from the effects
of his free-trade heresy, so he commenced
crying for free silver. But he did not shift
from the tariff to the money question un
til he bad declared that all the distresses
that had come upon the country were at
tributable to "Republican high tariff."
Now he says it was not the tariff, bnt the
demonetization of silver that caused hard
times.
Thus it will be seen the Democratic
party renounces and denounces all of its
traditions to cover up the iniquity of the
Wilson-Gorman free-trade act. The party
could not go before the country on the
tariff question, and so the young and am
bitious men of the organization tooÂ£ up
Bland's old Btory, which was for silver
monometallism, and by repeating it over
and over again they hoped to make the
people forget it was the Democratic tariff
that had bankrupted them all. No one
has failed to observe that Bryan and all
other Democratic speakers avoid the tariff
question. It is not avoided, however, be
cause they ao not believe in free trade, but
to divert the attention of the people away
from it. There is not a true biinetallist in
tbe Democratic party. Those who ab
stained from voting in the Chicago con
vention were simply standing by the sin
gle gold standard traditions of tha par iv,
while those who followed the lead of Alt
geld proclaimed for silver monometallism.
But the purpose of it all is to call atten
tion from the disastrous working of the
Wilson-Gorman law and win upon a new
issue. Their purpose, however, to revamp
the present tariff act upon lines that lead
to more complete free trade is as deter
mined as ever it was.
THE STOCKTON FESTIVAL.
The civic as well as the State patriotism
of the people of Stockton has roused
them to more than ordinary energy and
enterprise in preparing for the entertain
ment of the Native Sons during the festi
vals attending tbe annual celebration of
Admission day. From all reports that
come to us it seems that Stockton intends
to outdo not only herself but all other
cities in the splendor and extent of her
accomplishment, and make the celebra
tion this year the most brilliant in the an
nals of California.
There is nothing unusual in the fact that
the people of Stockton are making an
effort to provide a finer festival for Admis
sion day than has yet been seen in the
State. Every California community has
an aspiration to be a record-breaker. Each
one, when it undertakes an' enterprise, en
deavors to surpass all previous accom
plishments in that direction. That Stock
ton, therefore, should make the effort is
only to put herself in line with her sister
cities. The unusual feature is that all
evidence points to the conclusion that her
efforts will result in a degree of success
far beyond anything yet achieved. Each
successive celebration has surpassed former
ones in some respect, but Stockton prom
ises somothing that will surpass them in
all respects.
There are abundant reasons to justify
the most sanguine expectations of the
coming festival. For a year past Stockton
bas been the central city of California en
terprise. New railroads have infused her
people with new hopes and stimulated her
trade with large amounts of money. What
the people of otber localities have read
about those of Stockton have seen and felt.
For her the new era has already dawned
and her industrial and commercial activi
ties bave begun to manifest themselves in
many new directions. Her citizens, there
fore, are in a humor to undertake things
in a great way and to carry them out with
vigor and magnificence. They feel cheer
ful, buoyant, strong; sure of the present,
sanguine of tbe future, and 'as a conse
quence they work together with a harmony
and an enthusiasm that can not fail to pro
duce large results.
The celebration will be in fact some
thing like a festival in honor of a new
Stockton. It will be worth anybody's
time and money to make the trip to the
city at that time, even if he cares little for
the fetes anil entertainments of the Na
tive Sons. Stockton is one of tbe locali
ties in the State where for the next ten
years investments are going to yield the
biggest profits and where capital and en
terprise will sret their best rewards. The
youth ot California could not this year
hold their celebration in a more appro
priate place. They will see in the streets
of the city a thousand evidences of the
advancing prosperity of tbe State and a
thousand proofs of what can be accom
plished in California by industry, energy,
enterprise and the united efforts of pro
gressive men.
TRUE BIMETALLISM.
Advocates of a gold standard monetary
system are so few and far between tnat
tney are not worth considering in the
effort of the people to reopen the mints to
silver. Practically all the people favor
the reinstatement of the silver dollar to
its former position of redemption money
on a parity with gold, but not anywhere
near a majority of tbe people are willing
to open the mint,- to the free and unlimited
coinage of silver witbout proper safe
guards. Unless a silver dollar is coined
under such circumstances and conditions
as to have a debt-paying and purchasing
power of its own that is on a parity with
a gold dollar the people do not want the
mints opened to the white metal. The
country ueeds a larger volume of circulat
ing money, but it wants dollars that would
be acceptable in business circles at their
face value without question. It is easy
enough to open the mints unconditionally
, to silver coinage, but it is quite a different
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, 1896.
thing to make people accept such dollars
in payment for their commodities.
Were the people of the United States to
isolate tnemselves from other peoples it
wonld be a very easy matter for them to
determine what kind of a dollar sbonld
stand for the unit of value, bnt it so hap
pens that a round percentage of the grow
ing wealth of the country comes as the
result of our trade intercourse with the
people of other countries. It is an old
saying that it taxes two to make a bargain,
and onr experience iv foreign markets
prove tbe truth of it. Mr. Bryan holds
tbat we need not consult tne people with
wbom we do business concerning the kind
of money we issue and that tiiey must
take it on onr sayso without asking any
questions. If this Government is to take
that position it must accord other nations
the same right and our merchants should
not grumble if the merchants of Mexico
insist upon paying their trade balances in
Mexican silver dollars, nor should objec
sion be raised against China's silver taels
or Japan's silver yens.
International commerce is carried on at
this time on the basis of the gold dollar,
and we have to conform to it or sever all
business relations with the outside world.
Mr. McKinley fally appreciates the value
to us of our foreign trade, and he would
not jeopardize it by an attempt to arbi
trarily force other people to abandon their
own customs and adopt ours. He realizes
tne importance of increasing tbe volume
of the money of all the commercial na
tions, and the leading statesmen and
financiers of practically all the nations are
in accord with his opinion on that ques
tion. Now, in view of the intimate trade
relations between us and other nations,
and of the willingness of other nations to
co-operate, it is the purpose of the Re
publican party, through Mr. McKinley, to
assemble the nations in interest together
and agree upon a basis for increasing their
volume of money in an amount exactly
equal to the world's production of silver
in a way that the silver dollar would of
and by itself be just as acceptable as a
gold dollar. When that is done, all the
nations would open their mints to the free
and unlimited coinage of silver, and the
product of the mints would everywhere
have the same value, debt-paying and
purchasing power a* held by a gold dollar.
When that is accomplished the United
States would have bimetallism upon a
foundation that is the equal of gold in
every way and in every particular.
DENOUNCING "McKINLEYISM."
Manufacturers in England and Ger
many are having a good deal to say about
"McKinleyism" these days, and not in a
complimentary way, either. The increase
of woolen goods sold in America since the
Democratic tariff became operative has so
sharpened the appetites of woolen-mill
owners across the water for our gold that
they get wild with rage when it is told
them that the days of free trade and their
supremacy in American markets are num
bered, but it is human nature to feel a
trifle bitter under such circumstances.
The repeal of the McKinley act permitted
German and English makers of woolen
gooda to increase their sales in this coun
try by considerably over ?40,000,000 a year.
in an interview the other day with an
American newspaper correspondent a Ger
man manufacturer had the frankness to
say that if McKinley is elected their mills
will have to shut down, and "all the
American gold we shall see will be that of
the tourist." It is really too bad, but the
people are entertaining the idea that mills
and factories are pretty good things for
this country, and they propose to Rive
them such conditions for operating that
they will rnn right along at fair profits
for themselves and high wages for their
their employes. The manufacturers of
England and Germany are not to be
blamed for feeling sore over the loss of
such a profitable customer as America has
been for two or three years, nor shall we
mind it if they lie awake of nights to abuse
"McKinleyism."
We do not in this country particularly
relish the report which comes from the
manufacturing centers of Europe that
money is being subscribed to send over
here to defeat McKinley. There may be
no truth in it, but the fact that "McKin
leyism" is being so vehemently denounced
on the other side of the water, and the
further fact that McKinley's election
would mean the resumption of manu
facture in America, leads one to believe
the story. But any way the armies of idle
men in this country and the millions of
unemployed money have had all the free
trade they want, and whether Europe
likes it or not our industrial plants are
going to start i>p so that the people may
again enjoy prosperity. Of course, Eu
rope will suffer by it, but business is not
philanthropy, and the people, while feel
ing sorry for the industrial distress of the
old country, have concluded to resume
business on business principles at the old
stands that were so prosperous before
"McKinleyism" was murdered in the
house of those who should have been
America's friends.
WOOL UNDER BRYANISM,
It is shown quite plainly in an article in
the columns of to-day's Call that tbe Wil
son bill is responsible for the present de
pressed state of the wool market and for
the deplorable condition of the woolen
manufactories of the country.
Mr. Wollner gives startling facts, and
what he says Is entitled to great weight, as
he is an expert on matters pertaining to
wool. He speaks in terms that men of
the trade fully understand. Yet ~tb very
voter will draw conclusions from what he
says.
The most careful study of the subject
convinces the unbiased student that Bry
anism in matters of Government is a de
lusion and a snare. If there is any one
subiect where it is shown that free trade is
a failure it is that of wool. No blight has
ever hurt the business like the Wilson bill,
the very measure that Bryan urged as a
panacea for industrial ills.
McKINLEY'S HOME COUNTY.
Bryan's managers are trying to make
capital out of the refusal of a Republican
of Canton to bet that Mr. McKinley's
home county would not return a Demo
cratic majority. It would be an unsafe
bet for any Republican to make. Stark
County, Ohio, is to Ohio what Alabama
and Texas are to the Unionâ reliably Dem
ocratic Stark County has always been
called tbe banner Democratic county of
Ohio, but fox the information of the De
mocracy we will say that Major McKinley
has carried the county, although he is the
only Republican who ever did. Soon after
tbe war Major McKinley ran for the office
of prosecuting attorney of Stark County
and during the campaign he gained the
friendship of the working people. They
elected him by a small majority, and have
stuck by him ever since, though they
failed oa a few occasions to pull him
through. Generally speaking tbe Demo
crats of Stark County are still voting for
Andrew Jackson.
But since the Democrats have brought
to mind the fact that Mr. McKLnley's
county is a Democratic community, it is
well enough to suggest V"'- tha Vlg> o
earners of the county always support Mr.
McKinley. This leads to another item of
what may be news to Democrats gener
ally, which is that wage-earners all over
the country are for Major McKinley.
There never was a candidate for the Presi
dency who had as many friends among
the labor class as Mr. McKinley, but that
is easily accounted for. During all the
years he was in Congress Mr. McKinley
was the recognized champion of labor. It
was to secure to labor more opportunity
for work and at higher wages that he
drafted the great tariff bill which bore
his name. No one has failed to observe
that delegations of wage-earners are call
ing upon him every day to pledge their
support. Perhaps the old mossback De
mocracy of Stark may carry the county
for Bryan, but Mr. McKinley will have the
satisfaction of knowing that ne received
the entire vote of the laboring class.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
FOUR MONET PLANKS.
Teipartite alliance of Dkmocrats, Silver Re-
publicans AND POPULISTS.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Dkae
Sir: Fora special reason to be disclosed at
another time I desire to place before the pub
lic the three money planks adopted by the
supporters of Mr. Bryan, as well as that of the
Republicans. I would suggest that all the
readers of The Call who take a reasonable In
terest Id the political situation should make it
a point to cut out and save for future refer
ence these fundamental statements issued by
the tripartite alliance of Democrats, silver Re
publicans and Populists as the basis of their
union in the support of Bryan as their Presi
dential candidate and also the Republican
money plank.
The National Democratic Convention at Chi
cago made the following declaration :
DEMOCBATIC MONEY PLANK.
Recognizing that the money question is para
mount to all others at this time, we Invite atten
tion To the fact that the Federal constitution
named silver and gold together as tne money
metals of tlie United States, and that the first
coinage i>Â« passed by Coneress under the consti
tution made the silver dollar the monetary unit
and admitted gold to free coinage at a ratio based
upon the silver dollar unit. We deci'ar* that the
act of 1878. demonetizing silver without the
knowledge or approval of the American people,
has resulted iv thÂ« appreciation of gold and a- cor
responding fall in the price of commodities pro
duced by the people, a heavy increase in the bur
den of taxation and of all debts, public and private,
the enrichment of tbe money-lending class at
home and abroad, the prostration of industry and
impoverishing or tha people.
We are unalterably opposed to monometallism,
which lias locked fast tbe prosperity of an indus
trial people In the paralysis of hard times. Gold
monometallism is a British policy, and iti adop
tion has brought other nations into financial ser
vitude to I<ondon. It is not only un-American,
but auti-Americun, and it can be fastened on tbe
UniMd States only by the stifling of that spirit
and love of liberty which proclaimed our political
independence in 1776, and won it in the War of
the JU volution.
We demand the free and unlimited coinage of
both gold and silver at the present legal ratio of 16
to 1 without watting for the aid or consent of any
other nation. We demand that ibe standard silver
dollar shall be full legal tender equally with gold
for ail debts, public and private, and we favor such
legislation as will prevent fÂ»r the future the de
monetization of any kind of legal tender money
by private contract.
Congress alone baa the power to coin and Issue
money aid President Jackson declared that this
power could not be delegated to corporations or
Individuals. We, therefore, denounce the issu
ance of notes as money for the National banks as
in derogation of the constitution and we demand
that all the paper money which is made legal
tender for public and private debts, or which is re
ceivable for dues to the United States, shall be is
sued by the Government of the United States and
shal^be redeemable in coin.
SILVER REPUBLICAN MONEY PLANK.
Adopted at the National Silverite Conven
tion in St. Louis:
l'irstâ The paramount Issue at this time in the
United .States is indisputably the money question,
it is between the gold standard, gold bonds and
bunk currency on tbe one side and the bimetallic
standard, no bonds and Government currency on
the other.
On this issne we declare onrselves to be in favor
of a distinctively American system. Wetra un
alterably opposed to a single gold standard, and
demand Immediate return to the constitutional
standard of gold aud silver, by restoration by this
Government, independent of any foreign power,
of the unrestricted coinage of both gold and silver
into standard money at the ratio Of 10 to 1, and
upon term* of exact equality, as they existed
prior to 1873, the allver coin to be a full legal
tenter equally with gold for all debts and dues,
public aud private: and we favor such legislation
as will prevent for the future the demonetization
of any kind of legal tender money by private con
tract.
We bold that the power to control and regulate
paper currency is Inseparable from the power to
coin money: aud hence, that all currency in
tended to circulate aa money should be issued and
its volume controlled by tbe General Government
only, and should be legal tender.
We are unalterably opposed to the issue by the
United States of interest-bearing bonds in time of
peace, aud we denounce as a blunder worse than a
crime, the present treasury policy, concurred in by
a Kepublican House, of plunging, the country in
debt by hundreds of millions in the vain attempt
to maintain the gold Standard by borrowing gold,
aud we demand the payment of all coin obliga
tions of the United StaUs. as provided by existing
lav.s. iv eitlitr koUi or silver com, at the- option of
the Government, and not at the option of the cred
itor.
SecondâThat over and above all other questions
of policy we are in favor of restoring to the people
of tli* United Btaten the timeÂ»bonored money of
the constitutionâ gold and sliver; not one, but
both, tbe money of Washington, and Hamilton,
and Jefferson, and Monroe, and Jackson, and .Lin
coln, to the end that the American people may re
ceive honest pay for an honest product; that the
American debtor may pay his just obligations in
any one standard and not in a standard that has
appreciated 100 per cent above all the great staples
of our country; and to the end further that sllver
standard countries may be deprived of the unjust
advantage they now enjoy iv the difference In ex
change between gold and silver, an advantage
which tariff legislation atone cannot overcome.
POPULIST MONEY FLANK.
Adopted in National Convention at St. Louis:
Firstâ We demand a National money, safe and
sound. Issued by the General Government only,
without the intervention of banks of issue, to be
full legal tender for all debts, private and public a

bursements of the Government.

foreign nations.

BLAINE ON THE SILVER ISSUE.
A Refutation of Gabbled Extracts From
His Great Speech op 1878.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
The Examiner of to-.day contains the follow
ing:
BLAINE'S PBOPHETIC 6FEF.CH.
f James G. Blame In Cnited States Senate, 1880.]
I believe the struggle now going on in this coun
try and in other countries for a single gold
standard would, if successful, produce widespread
disaster in and throughout the commercial worla.
The destruction of silver as money, and establish
ing gold as tbe sole unit of value, must have a
ruinous effect upon all forms of property except
those investments which yield a fixed return in
money. Those wonld be enormously enhanced iv
value, and would gain a disproportionate and un
fair advantage over otber species of property. If,
as the most reliable statistics affirm, there are
nearly $7,000,000,000 of coin or .bullion in the
world, very equally divided between gold and
sil vit, it is impossible to strike silver out of ex
istence as money without results that will nrove
distressing to millions and utterly disastrous to
tens of thousands.
1 believe gold and Bilver coin to be tbe money
of tbe constitution; Indeed, the money of the
American people anterior to the constitution
which the great organic law recognised as quite
independent of its own existence. No power was
conferred on Congress to declare either metal
should not be money. Congress has, therefore, in
my judgment, no power to demonetize either. If,
therefore, silver has been demonetized I am iv
favor of remoneiizlng it: if its coinage has been
prohibited I am In favor o fordering it to be re
sumed. lam In favor of having It eu.argeJ.
These are garbled quotations from tbe open
ing paragraphs of a speech by the greatest
American of his day on "Remonetization of
Silver," delivered in the United States Senate
not in 1880 but on February 7, 1878, when the
Senate, in committee of the whole, had under
consideration an act to authorize tbe free
coinage of the standard silver dollar and to
restore its legal tender character.
Mr. Blame did not In that speech utter a
single sentence to show thut be favored the
free and unlimited coinage of silver, as the
organs of the silver-mine owners would fain
have us believe. He never indorsed any
scheme for an inflated currency which would
be paramount to repudiation.
In that speech he did say: "If we coin a
silver dollar of full legal tender, obviously
below the current value of the gold dollar, we
are simply openintr our doors and inviting
Europe to take our gold. With our gold ilo w
ing out from us we shall be forced to the single
silver standard, ana our relations with the
leading commercial countries of the world
will be not only embarrassed but crippled."
He said further on in the same speech: "If
we coin too low a dollar before general remou
etization our gold will leave us. If we coin
too high a dollar after general demonetization
our silver will leave us. It is only an equated
value before and after general remonetization
that will preserve both gold aud silver to us."
The Democratic press which is giving pub
licity to the extract taken from the Examiner
religiously, cautiously and sedulously re
frains from publishing either of tbe quota
tions I have mentioned. The purpose is ap
parent to the most careless newspaper reader.
A few paragraphs are lilched from the utter
ances of the dead knight of protection, sound
niouey and America for Americans, and are
sent broadcast in the vain hope that the luke
warm Republicans may be induced to desart
the party which saved the Nation from de
struction and preserved its financial honor.
The speech referred to was not in defense
of free coinage unlimited, but was a strong
plea for bimetallism. Mr. Blame favored the
use of the two metals, silver to be at a parity
with gold. Let me quote him again in the con
cluding passage of that speech, which gives
silver mine-owners so much concern :
"With abounding proof of its demoralizing
and destructive effect we have it proclaimed
in the halls ol Congress that 'the people de
mand cheap money.' I deny it. 1 declare
such a phrase to be a totel misapprehensionâ a
total misapprehension of the popular wish.
The people do not demand cheap money.
They demand an abundance of good money,
which is an entirely different thing. They do
not want a single gold standard that will ex
clude silver and benefit those already rich.
They do not want an inferior silver standard
that will drive out gold and not help those
already poor. They want both metals, in full
value, in equal honor, in whatever abundance
the bountiful earth will yield them to the
searching eye of science and to the hard hand
of labor." Respectfully, Fbank 6torer.

Disaster seems to follow everyting con
nected with the Southern Pacific's ship
ping interests. Steamer after steamer has
been lost and tbe Mail Company's Colom
bia is now being dismantled at Pigeon
Point. Yesterday her engines were un
loaded from the schooner Free Trade at
Folsom-street wharf and the boilers are
now being taken out and loaded into the
schooner Volante.
The news of more trouble came from
Yokohama Saturday. The steamer Gaelic
on her way from Hongkong for San Fran
cisco ran ashore at Shimonoseki, on the
coast of Japan, and soon thereafter there
was ten feet of water in her hola. D. D.
Stubbs of the Southern Pacific and secre
tary of the Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company, says the Gaelic has been
temporarily repaired and taken to Yoko
hama, where she will be docked.
Just how the accident happened no one
seems to know, and the mystery will be
only cleared up when the vessel arrives
here. At Shimonoseki there is only soft
mud and it seems impossible for a big
steamer to injure herself very much by
running ashore. The general impression
is that she was in collision and that Cap
tain Pearne ran her ashore to save his
ship. The Gaelic had a large cargo of tea
and Oriental merchandise, and as ncr fore
hold was flooded a considerable loss will
result.
The steamer City of Puebla sailed for
Puget Sound ports yesterday morning,
and there was a scene on the wharf before
she got away. Percy Douglas, a young
man from Bakersfield, caused the arrest

Borne jewelry from him. Birdie's sister
and Douglas had been good friends, but
the young woman persuaded her to leave
him and was on ncr way to Victoria, B. C,
when arrested. Miss V> ilson says it is a
case of persecution, and Douglas says he
doesn't care what she calls it so long as
he gets bis money and jewelry back. '
Andrew Johnson, a crazy sailor, jumped
off Broadway wharf yesterday. John
Gray, the boatman, wens to his rescue,
but had to fight hard before he could get
tne would-be suicide into the boat. When
land was reached Gray turned the sailor
over to Officers Dower and Crosby, but on
the way to the Harbor Police Station he
attempted to throw himself under a pass
ing electric-car. He was again rescued
and finally locked up in the Harbor Police
Station.
A private letter received by Al White
from Copper River says that in one sense
the season up there has been a remarkably
good one and in another a remarkably
bad one. The run of salmon was very
good and the Alaska Packers' Association
had on hand July 25 last over 30.000
cases ready for shipment. The Pacific
Steam Whaling Company had almost as
many cases on hand, but a terrific storm
came up and blew down two of the com
pany's warehouses and ail the salmon
were washed into tbe river and lost. In
order to make up its deficiency the com
pany offered $10 "a thousand for fish and
was doing a rushing business when the
mail left.
The Bering Sea patrol fleet will disband
next month and return to San Francisco.
The Bear will reach Unalaska about Sep
tember 10, but will not return to this port
before November. In the meantime she
will visit all the Government supply
stations in Alaska.
Another halibut schooner got in from
the banks yesterday. It is the Little Pilot,
and she has 20,000 pounds of the fish
aboard. The captain is not going to sell
his stock on tbe vessel's deck, but will
open a fishstore on East street.
The German bark Assel, which came
here from Guaymas, will go to Noyo to
load lumber for London. This will be the
first cargo of redwood that has ever left
Noyo for Europe.
The steamer Wbitesboro, while on her
way from Port Costa to her berth at Main
street, struck a snag and lost one of the
blades of her propeller. She will go on
the ways at Oakland for repairs.
The steamer Progreso is idle just now
and her owners have seized the oppor
tunity to put her on the Union Iron
Works' drydock to get a new shaft fitted
to her engines.
Work on the Spear-street bulkhead will
begin to-day. Some time ago the Harbor
Commissioners let a contract for the re
building of the wharf, but the contractors
failed after tearing up the planking. The
work has now been relet to the San Fran
cisco Bridge Company and it will push the
work.
The fog which caused the loss of the
Colombia and St. Paul seems to have
reached even Alaska. The mail-steamer
Ella Rohlffs, which left Karluk on July 17
for Chignlk, was lost for seven days and
finally managed to reache Karluk again
on July 26. A fresh start was made when
the fog lifted.
The schooner Vine has at last reached
Central America. She left here on June
11 for the southern seas, but bad consid
erable cargo to land at Champerico and
San Jose de Guatemala. At the latter
port Captain Luttreli found 5000 tons of
Pacific Mail Company freight stored up
in warehouses and on tne wharf awaiting
shipment. In consequence the Vine was
considerably delayed in getting her con
signments ashore.
On July I' 6 the schooner ran into a hur
ricane. Three waterspouts passed close
to the vessel, and one of them came too
close to the bowsprit to be pleasant. A
lightning-storm followed, and in his letter
Captain Luttreli says the mastheads were
like oalls of fire. Some of the crew were
so affected by the electricity that for days
afterward their bodies felt as though they
had the prickly heat. The interior of the
cabin was painted with white enamel, but
the electric fluid took control and all the
paneling is now a bright blue. The Vine
did not steer well, and Captain Luttreli
had considerable difficulty in making port.
The following vessels' of the AJaska
Packers' Association have been reported as
having arrived safely: Steamers â Royal,
Polar Bear, President; shipsâ Levi G. Bur
gess. Louisiana, Harry Morse; barks â Will
W. Case, Nicholas Thayer, Merom, Charles
B. Kenney; schooner Prosper.
The steamer Ella Rohlffs left Karluk
July 17 with mail for Chignik, returned to
Karluk July 26, having lost her bearings
in a hravy fog which Tasted for six days,
and drifted ciose to Unga before position
of steamer could be ascertained.
The reports from the canneries of the
Alaska Packers' Association are very
favorable.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, 1896.
Jhe Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company's Qaelic Went Ashore on the Coast of Japan Last

)\zt Forehold When She Was Touted Off, the Loss is Likely to Be Quite HeaVy.
DEFIANT OF THE
GRAND JURORS,
Oliver Winfield Winthrop
Denies Their Right to
Indict.
LEES IS CONFIDENT.
He Relies on Donald Urqukart's
Affidavit for a Con
viction,
A STORY TOLD IN JAIL.
The Developments in the Campbell
Scandal Are Growing Daily
More Sensational.
The attorneys of Oliver W. Winthrop
are still fighting for delay. Yesterday
when Winthrop was arraigned before
Judge Wallace Attorney Frank Bell filed a
motion to set aside the indictment of the
Grand Jury. It was claimed that the in
dictment is not properly indorsed; that
the names of the witnesses are not prop
erly inseited at the end of the indictment;
that the Grand Jury was not properly
drawn; that a person was present when
the Grand Jury was discussing the indict
ment, and a number of other "tbats." It
was also claimed that tne Grand Jury was
influenced in making the indictment by
newspaper reports.
District Attorney Barnes in reply said
that the indictment had been objected to
on almost every statutory ground, but
that he nevertheless was ready to proceed
with the case and would at once send for
the members of the Grand Jury to refute
the charges of the defendant's attorneys.
It was decided, however, to allow the
matter to go over until this morning at 10
o'clock, when Judge Wallace will resume
the hearing.
The individual members of the Grand
Jury will, therefore, have to appear before
Judge Wallace this morning to prove that
each is entitled to pass upon the demerits
of a fellow-citizen.
Attorney Frank Bell, who for years
studied law in the offices of General W. H.
L. Barnes, Chauncey Depew's rival in
after-dinner speeches, is the roan who is
putting these nineteen self-sacrificing gen
tlemen to the test.
Bell, with Mr. Quitzow, his associate,
proposes to show that not only Oliver
Winfield Winthrop did not kidnap Mil
lionaire James A. Campbell and torture
him for the sake of obtaining a $20,000
check, but that even if he did the Grand
Jury men, individually as well as collect
ively, are not legally entitled to find indict
ments against any one, much less this
client.
The strongest evidence in the possession
of the police is the testimony ot Donald
Urquhart. It is upon this evidence prin
cipally that Captain Lees believes he will
convict Winthrop. Urquhart has sworn
to a statement that many weeks ago he
was asked by Winthrop to enter into a
kidnaping scheme out of which they
might make money by torturing the party
kidnaped.
On the Monday afternoon when Win
throp left the Occidental Hotel with
Campbell, Urquhart met them on Mont
gomery street, near Clay, where they
boarded the cable-car, and, remembering
that Campbell was due to leave this City
on the Honolulu steamer the next day, he
decided to Keep track of what might pos
sibly take place. The couple got away
from him, however, and he paid nu further
attention to them until the newspapers
gave an account of the disappearance of
Millionaire Campbell.
Urquhart immediately sought Captain
John Curtin and told him of his suspi
cions. The tale that he told then, even
prior to the release of Campbell by the
thugs, is on the same lines as the story
told by the Hawaiian planter of his kid
naping and incarceration.
The indications, therefore, an that
Urquhart told the truth about the inten
tions of Winthrop as to the handling of
Campbell, since the latter, a stranger to
him, related the same details when he was
able to crawl home after his two clays' in
carceration.
Learning the story from Urquhart Cap
tain John Curtin informed Captain Lees
of the possibilities for a great crime in the
case. He told him how Urquhart and
Winthrop had been fellow-prisoners in the
County Jail, where the latter had disclosed
his future plans of making money by kid
naping wealthy people. He told him how
on a subsequent occasion Winthrop had
picked out Campbell as the most likely
wealthy man to pay big ransom for his
release from custody."
It was after receiving all this informa
tion that Captain Lees set his men to
work. Their efforts, however, proved un
availing, as Campbell, released by his cap
tors, strolled into the rooms of his wife at
the Occidental Hotel, a much-abused man,
starved, bruised and bleeding.
It is on the above testimony that Cap
tain Lees depends to land Winthrop in
jail.
Winthrop, on the other side, says noth
ing, but laugh 5 at the detectives and their
efforts to convict him.
It is evident that Captain Lees is leaving
no stone unturned to secure tbe conviction
of Winthrop. The whole story of his
trouble in tbe Jennie Matthews case,
where he was accused of murder, has been
probed over again, and tentacles have been
reached out into tbe army ana navy for
something which might be calculated to
be of detriment to the prisoner.
One of the individuals who has given
Captain Lees gome information in the
matter does not care to sign his name to
it, or if he does Captain Lees will not tell
who it is. The chief of detectives, how
ever, furnished tbe press with the anony
mous communication, which places some
what of a different phase on Winthrop, so
far as his real name is concerned:
Captain Lees' investigations as to Winthrop's
antecedents:
On June 17, 1870, in Providence, R. 1., I en
listed, and was assigned to the Tenth Infan
try, v. 8. A. I was then sent to Governors
Island, New York harbor. On July 2, 1870, in
company with ninety-nine other recruits we
left Governors Island for Fort Brown, Texas,
via New Orleans, and we were about twenty
days making the trip. Among this number of
recruits was one Oscar Staninuer, also known
on the trip as Isaao Calkins, the latter sup
posed to be his true name. While on this trip
one of the recruits lost or had stolen from him
a soldier's uniform coat, and upon making a
search the coat was found in the possession of
Recruit Staninger, alias Calkins. The coat
was taken from him and returned to the
owner. We were all assigned to different
companies of the Tenth Infantry, U. S. A., at
Fort Brown, Texas. I did not know what com
pany Staninger, alias Calkins, was assigned to.
From Fort Brown 1 went to my company at
Ringgold Barracks, Texas. This was in 1870.
In 1878, while at Whippie Barracks, Ari
zona, one day a soldier came up to me and
asked, "Is not this (informant)?" I said,
"Yes, that is my name." The soldier said,
"Don't you know me?" I said, "Your face is
familiar. I have seen you before, but I cannot
recall your name." He said, "I used to be
Staninger; lam Winthrop now." I then rec
ollected him very well. Winthrop at that
time was a private in the Eighth Infantry,
stationed at this point. The next time I saw
him was in or about 1885 in the vicinity of
Laurel Hill Cemetery, this City. I have no
personal acquaintance with him. I judge he
is 46 or 47 years of age. I think his right
name is Calkins. He enlisted the latter part
of June, 1870, I think, under the name of
Staninger, and by communicating with the
officer commanding the Tenth U.S. A. Infan
try or the Adjutant-General's office, U.S.A.,
Washington, D. C, Staninger's, alias Calkius',
enlistment record as a soldier and date of dis
charge can be obtained in the enlistment of
1870.
To the above Winthrop simple answers:
"The man who made that statement is a
liar; I have an honorable army record."
SOCIALISTS IN COURT,
Their Attorneys Will Fight the
Case on Points of
Law,
Monteith Predicts That Common People
Will Soon Be Asked to Keep
Off the Earth.
Judge Conlan's courtroom presented
the usual animated Monday morning
scene yesterday. A score of forlorn-look
ing vaerants, blear-eyed Sunday revelers,
bedraggled and defiant women and meek
looking Chinamen crowded the docks.
Loud-voiced attorneys clamored excitedly
for the attention of the court and a stout
lunged bailiff shouted in stentorian tones
for order. He might as well have spoken
to the sea.
In this motley array the eight men ar
rested Saturday night for expounding so
cialistic doctrines at the corner of Seventh
and Market Btreets clustered about their
attorneys, George W. Monteith and Bur
nett G. Haskell, and waited patiently un
til it should come their turn to be grist for
the mil! of justice.
In the portion of the courtroom reserved
for spectators were a number of men
wearing buttons bearing the insignia of
the Socialist-Labor party. They had come
to witness the fate of their comrades who
were about to be arraigned. They were
disappointed. From a spectacular point
of view the Police Court is a failure, and
in the confusion attendant upon the rapid
disposal of Saturday night and Sunday
patty offenders only an experienced court
room hanger-on can get an idea of just
what is going on.
The proceedings in the case of the so
cialists were brief. When the cases of
William Costley, E. J. Kingsley, George
Speed, G. Ashden, N. Speeney, J. Postler,
E. Lux and T. Anthony were called At
torney Monteith stated that the defend
ants wished to plead.
"We intend to argue this matter on
points ot law," he said, "and would like
the arraignment continued until Thursday
morning."
Judge Carroll, who was officiating in
Judge Conlan's absence, granted the de
sired continuance.
Monteith says it is the intention of the
defendants to fight the case to the end.
"There is a principle at stake," he said.
"We intend to see whether or not the
police can arrest men for speaking peace
ably upon the street. Three years ago
they wanted Coxey to keep off the grass.
They now .want the socialists to keep off
the streets, and it won't be long before
they'll want all the common people to get
off tbe earth."
Chief Crowlev said yesterday that it was
not the intention of the police to interfere
with any of the inalienable riehis of citi
zens. The people, he said, had unques
tionably the right to meet and discuss
their views, but they had no right to
choose such places as blockade traffic,
Property-owners in the vicinity of Sixth
street have complained to him, as had the
owners of the Odd Fellows' building, say
ing their tennants were greatly annoyed
by their meetings. He suggested that
there were numerous vacant lots and other
places suitable for such meetings which
would not be objectionable.
The Chiei is undecided what course he
will pursue in the future. At present no
arrests will be made unless the circum
stances are aggravated, as the police wish
to see what the action of the courts will be.
To Greet Frederick Warde.
Thursday evening, August 20, Fredeiick
Warde will deliver his lecture on "Shake
speare" at the Young Men's Christian Associ
ation Audltori urn, Mason and Ellis streets.
District Attorney W. S. Barnes will preside and
introduce Mr. Warde, and the entertainment
will be very enjoyable. Mr. Warde has always
been ready to assist the various societies, lite
rary and otherwise, in this City, and has given
his services gratuitously for many lectures.
In view of this fact he should have a grand
ovation at the association next Thursday
night and his friends should rally to his finan
cial support. Tickets will be 50 cents to all
parts of the house, and are now on sale at Sher
man, Clay & Co.'s.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
CITY CREDITORS
RELY ON A VOTE,
They Will Lay Their
Claims Before the
People.
THROUGH LEGISLATION.
Their Just Bills Were Repu
diated on a Legal
Technicality.
TWO YEABS IN THE STRUGGLE.
At Last the Creditors Decide on a
Course of Action With Much
Enthusiasm.
The merchants who bare long standing
claims against the City, tnrough which
they have become known as the City's
associated creditors, met yesterday after
noon in the assembly hall of the Board of
Trade at 202 Market street. J. P. Le Count
occupied the chair.
Mr. Le Count, representing a committee,
presented an exhaustive report which re
viewed the situation in detail, how tne
debts were incurred by the City and re
pudiated on mere legal technicalities.
He said that two years have passed since
the "City's creditors" commenced active
measures to secure recognition of their
just claims against the City, two years of
continuous effort to secure tbe satisfaction
of these claims. And though no tangible
results have been accomplished yet he felt
that the work has not been done in vain.
On the contrary he could assure his fellows
that a strong public feeling has been
aroused by the constant agitation that has
been kept up.
"The people," said he, "are fully aware
that there is a large debt hanging over the
City due to its tax-paying citizens and
that they feel it to be a disgrace to our
City and citizens."
Continuing, Mr. Le Count's report stated
that there are 144 associated creditors who
have spent their time and money for all
the creditors, aggregating 600 to 700. Their
claims amount to $45,000 out of a total of
$360,000.
A review of the work done looking to
ward collection of these debts was pre
sented in detail. This included the legal
contests for tbe claims, action of the Board
of bupervisors last year and rejection of
claims by the court, all of wheh has been
published in The Call.
With regard to a remedy the report
nays: "We certainly are now compelled to
seek other methods than those we have
employed. Neither time nor money has
been spared in the prosecution of the
work thus far, and at the present time we
seem to be meshed in a net of legal tech
nicalities, but there is yet a hope thai by
an apceal to the people direct we may at
tain our ends.
"As I before remarked we have ample
evidence that the people are with us: that
they will come to our support when we
provide the opportunity.
"A vote of the people authorizing the
payment of our demands would put the

and we then might expect to find our long
and continuous struggle at an end.
"To submit our case to a vote of the
people would necessitate legislative aid.
A bill would have to be passed authoriz
ing the submission of this question to a
popular vote. 1 believe the people are
with us, and I believe it is due ourselves
to mane this final attempt to secure the
satisfaction of our demands."
A suggestion was made from the chair
to the effect that an executive committee
of five be appointed with full power to
act, and to appoint auxiliary committees
if necessary, the ultimate purpose to be
to present ibe case to the people for a
popular vote.
F. W. Eaton, treasurer of the telephone
company, made a motion that the sugges
tion be adopted, and L. Battles of the
light company seconded the motion,
whicn was carried unanimously.
The chairman announced he would
name the committee in a few days, where
upon the meeting adjourned.

CROSSED THE BAR
FOR THE UNKNOWN
Captain Millen Griffith
Passes Away at San
Rafael.
PIONEER OF THE STATE.
He Was One of the Best-Known
Men in Shipping and Min
ing Circles.
IN THE TOWBOAT BUSINESS.
Latterly He Had Been Suffering
Through Illness and the End
Came as a Relief.
Captain Millen Griffith, a California pio
neer and one of the best-known shipping
and mining men on the coast, died yester
day morning at his residence in San Ra
fael.
The immediate cause of death was stated
to be heart disease. He was said to have
been seriously indisposed for several
weeks, but the intelligence of his death
came upon his friends with a shock.
Since the death of his wife on the 4th of
July he never appeared the same man.
He closed his home at 569 Harrison street
and removed with three of his children to
San Rafael, where he rented the cottage
in which he died.
Captain Griffiths was a native of New
York State, where he was born seventy
one years ago. As a boy he exhibited a
strong desire to go to sea, and at 16 he se
cured a berth as cabin-boy on an East In
diaman. In 1849 he rounded the Horn and
dropped anchor in the Bay of San Fran
cisco. In 1856 he was offered an interest
in tne Tayo, a large mining property in
Mexico, which was owned principally by
the wealthy Bradbury family.
The mine was at the time full of water
and in a very bad condition generally, but
Griffiths went into the deal and the inter
est wbicu ne bought paid him at the rate
of $4000 a month for over ten years.
About 1870, with Captain Goodall as an
associate, he entered the tugboat business,

HOW FREE TRADE HAS HURT THE WOOL INDUSTRY
It was Bhown some weeks ago in a
series of articles in The Call that the free
trade policy of William Jennings Bryan,
as seen in the Wilson tariff, played havoc
witb the woolen industry in all parts. of
the country; that 60 per cent of the fac
tories are idle throughout the United
States, and that the losses to labor and the
country at large are millions of dollars
every month.
It is well known to students of the tariff
that this record of depression is only a
history of the ruin wrought by frea trade
in the past. It is not strange, therefore,
that every investigation made shows the
same story of ruin to industry, and that
business men everywhere view free trade
with alarm.
One of the best informed men on the
status of the wool market of this coast is
Jacob Wollner, wool and commission
merchant. In his semi-annual market re
port, juet Jissued, many important facts
Btand out in bold relief. It seems from
his statement that there was hope of a
better market just after McKinley's nom
ination, but it waned after the Chicago
convention.
It also appears that Bryan's boast that
prosperity would come with free trade has
not materialized. Manufacturers have not
enlarged their trade and the sheepmen have
not even continued in business.
On August 1, 1592, the American Wool
and Cotton Reporter said: "There has
never been a time in the history of this
country that so much woolen machinery
has been so well employed as at thâ¬
present."
As a striking contrast, illustrative of
what free trade can do in a short time, the
words of the same paper on June 30, 1896,
are submitted. They run as follows:
"The past four week 9 have v been charac
terized by extreme dullness in the wo oi
trade. The transactions have been the
smallest ever reported, and not 30 per ceni
of the woolen-mills of the United Sta tee
are actively employed."
This is a striking object lesson, showing
that (he ideas of protection and prosperity
ptili live, as do those of free trade and
ruin. Mr. Wollner gives many startling
facts on the subject â enough to put to
DEMOCRACY'S WORD
BRITTLE AS GLASS,
Populists Indignant Because
of Broken Fusion
Pledges.
TREATED WITH DISDAIN
Thomas Watson Ignored Both in
the Nation and in This
State,
GEORGE MONTE ITH'S CHARGES
Democratic Leaders Playing In With
the Southern PacificâRepubli
cans at Work.
Populists are beginning to taste ot the j
bitterness of the unholy alliance which
their leaders seem so anxious to make with
the Democracy.
Thus far it has become apparent in
every instance that the Democrats have
broken every pledge they made several
months ago when the matter of fusion j
was broached by Democratic leaders, who |
knew that without the aid of the People's
party vote the Democracy would pass out
of history so far as California was con
cerned.
It has leaked out that the People's party j
placed only three candidates for Congress j
in the field, with the understanding that j
the Democrats would indorse these three |
and would not nominate any candidates j
against them, while the Populists would !
indorse the four candidates to be nomi
nated in the other districts by the Democ
racy. The Democrats, with their usual |
perfidy, have broken this pledge and have
turned down George W. Monteith, the
People's party candidate in the First Con
gressional District, just as they have
turned down all over the Nation Tom
Watson, the PeoDle's party candidate for
the Vice-Presidency.
Mr. Bryan has acknowledged the Peo
ple's party but once, and that was about a
week after his nomination, when he de
clared that he was a Democrat and that
he stood upon the Democratic platform.
Chi a subsequent occasion he also publicly
declared that the platform, of the People's
party as adopted at St. Louis was too radi
cal for himself and the rest of the Democ
racy and that he repudiated it.
He has never acknowledged his nomina
tion by the Populists, and has spurned
the platform on which he was nominated
at St. Louis, and he has refused to recog
nize Thomas Watson as a running mate
under any circumstances. 8o the Peo
ple's party stands to-day the backer of a
I'residemial nominee who spits in its face
ami tramples upon its platform.
The action of the National Democracy
in turning down Watson is copied by the
Democracy of thiÂ» State, which has not
only turned down Mr. Watson, but is re
pudiating the People's party nominees for
Congress in this State, thereby delib
erately breaking the pledges made to the
gullible and too eager leaders of the Popu- J
lists. The membersof that party through- i
out the State are indignant over the treat
ment being received by Thomas Watson,
and this indignation has been raised to
boiling heat by the manner in which the
Democracy is treating them in this State.
Miaule-of-tlie-road men are very well
pleased at the fulfillment of the predic
tions made by them. They said from the
outset ihat fusion meant death to the
party by surrendering it into the hands of
unscrupulous politicians who would use it
bs a catspaw and cast it aside with dis
dain whenever its services would be no
longer required.
There is a growing disposition among
the honest masses of the People's party in
this State to repudiate all efforts at fusion
and to put up a straight tictet. They say
(hat even the rotten Democracy is show
ing more devotion to principle than are
the Populists because the sound-money
Democrats are putting up a ticket and
noting for it without regaid to ttie effect
ivhich their action may have upon the
slection of Bryan or McKinley. They are
going to vote for principle and decline to
illow their principles to be swallowed by
the Bryan wing of the Democracy as the
National Populists are dome.
George W. Monteith, People's party can
didate lor Congress from the First District,
it infuriated over the treachery by which
.he Democrats have attempted to defeat
aim. He said last Saturday night, and
Startling Facts Given by Jacob Wollner, the Well-
Known Commission Merchant.
flight a field full of free-trade orators. His
views, being tns expert opinions of a
trained business man, are so valuable that
they are given at some lÂ«ngtb. He says,
among other things:
I will give some instances where free wool
did so much good (?) to sheepmen and manu
facturers. The increase in the production of
wool in the State of California in 1892 was
3,000,000 pounds over the production of 1891. :
This year the spring clip of California alone is
over 4,000,000 pounds less than last year, ow- |
ing to the fact that sheepmen were forced out
of the business, as they could not make ex
penses. The consumption of wool from the
Ist of January, 1896, to July 1 has been 56,
--000,000 pounds less than 1895 for the same
period. In 1892, under the McKinley tariff,
the prices of California, Nevada and Oregon
wool in this market averaged 18 cents, with a
lively demand, aud this year the average price
of the same wools is 6^ cents, with very little
demand. This is cne reason for it.
The importation of wool for fiscal year (from
July 1 to June 30): 1891,129,313,647 pounds:
1892, 148,670,652 pounds; 1893, 172,433,888
pounds: 1894, 55,152,558 pounds: 1895,203.
--708,635 pounds; 1896, 253,811,473 pounds
foreign wool.
Three-fourths of the wool imported previous
to 1895 was carpet wool, which does not come
into competition with our domestic wools, as
we do uot raise much wool of that kind, and
under tho McKinley tariff the duty only
amounted to 3 cents per pound on that class
of wool. Since 1893 we only imported 60,
--000,000 pounds of carpet wool on an average.
The balance of the imported wools came right
in competition with our wools, hence wool
prices raised in foreign countries and dropped
in this country.
The stronu showing thus made by the
sturdy merchant is a complete refutation
of the theories of Biyan, and what he says
is in keeping with evidence from other
ports of the Union. Continuing, Mr.
Wollner says:
The reason the importation of wool in 1894
was so small was owing to the delay in the
passing of the Wilson-Gorman tariff bill. Be
sides, since the passage of the tree wool bill,
the larger importation of wool, shoddies,
waste, rags, etc., has amounted to $20,000,000
yearly. This is owing to the fuct that Euro
pean manufacturers have flooded the country
with cheap goods, in the manufacture of
which, although wool is so low, a good deal of
his words will carry great weight to the
minds of his fellow- Populists:
Our experience to-day is an evidence of what
we are going to receive at the hands of the
Democrats. Apparently the only use they
have for us is to secure our votes, i didn't
come to Napa with ihe Idea that I personally
had any right to the Democratic nomination.
1 am not a Democrat, but I am & Populist and
haJ been given to understand that this district
would be conceded not to me, but to the party.
I am satisfied that the Southern Pacific Com
pany iB at the bottom of the matter.
If Mr. Monteith's surmise be correct it
is apparent that the People's party must
put a man in the field whose negative
quality of non-resistance will be accept
able to the Southern Pacific Company.
Mr. Monteith said further:
There were quite a number of delegates here
who sincerely wanted to deal justly with us,
but Mr. Geary and his proxies were too much
for them. lam satisfied that the railroad com
pany is at the bottom of tnis matter and that it
has "devised this method of keeping me out of a
position in which they know I would be aDle
to frustrate some of their schemes.
The Populist party had bsen led to believe
that the Democratic party would join in the
union of forces to secure the free coinage of
silver. We heartily and freely nominated
their candidate for President. In return we
expect to obtain their indorsement of at least
three out of the seven members of CongresÃ in
this State, besides concessions upon the legis
lative ticket. This performance to-day is a
good indication that they are not sincere in
their professions. They have begun work and
have nominated a candidate in every district
In which we had a nominee in this State ex
cept this district, and they will undoubtedly
place one in nomination here. The result of
that will be that they will so disgust and anger
our people tnat it is hard to tell just what will
be the final outcome.
The plea of the district convention here is
that the State committee has no control over
the district convention, and if this proposition
is carried to its logical conclusion it will apply
to every Assembly and Senatorial district in
the State, and the Populists will get beauti
fully left. We were perfectly willing to meet
them in a spirit of fairness and justice, while
on their part they are disposed to take ad
vantage of the situation. I have seen enough
to satisfy me, and do not intend to be a party
to any further negotiations at all. I begin my
campaign a week from to-day, and I shall go
to work and make a straight Populist and antl.
railroad fight all down the line. The Demo*
crats can do just what they please.
I have delayed my campaign for several
weeks upon the promise that they were going
to do something. Indeed I have done every
thing that could be done to bring about an
understanding. Now, after having made all
my arrangements and bavins got my fight
fully organized, they deliberately come to me
and suggest that I withdraw. That I certair.ly
will not do in any event. lam on the ticket,
and there to stay. If they do not display a
proper spirit toward the Populist par ty there
is no law that 1 know of that will compel them
to do so.
I certainly have no further time to waste in
what I know will be fruitless discussion. They
nave no intention of doing anything sxcept to
try to induce me to withdraw, which I have
no intention of doing. Therefore there Is no
room for any argument.
So far as tne committee that was appointed
is concerned there are several excellent gen
tlemen upon it, but it will be dominated by
railroad Influence. They might just as well
have made Mr. Herrin the chairman as Mr.
Geary. I will not have any dealing with Mr.
Geary under any circumstances or upon any
terms whatsoever. It will be utterly useless
for them to send a committee that contains
any railroad attorneys in its personnel to talk
to me. I will not deal with it In any way,
shape or form. On the contrary, I defy the
railroad and all its methods and warn its peo
ple that they are simply wasting their time in
trying to hoodwink me.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, 1896.
shoddies, waste and rags have been used, and
our manufacturers, In self-preservation, had
to follow the example, and therefore the infe
rior articles took the place of at least 60,000,
--000 pounds of wool.
Tha importation of manufactured goods,
which in 1892 amounted to $35,000,000, is
reported for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1896, at $57,559,923, and then it has to be taken
into consideration tbat Imported goods in 1892
were nearly 50 per cent nigher in valuation
than in 1896, as then only high-priced goods
were imported, whiie now all kinds of trash is
admitted to the country in consequence of the
low tariff, and so instead of manufacturers be
ing benefited by free wool they not only could
not export manufactured goods but lost over
$30,000,000 in home trade.
That is the picture of the present, but
the outlook for the future is even worse.
He says:
The outlook for prices and trade for stock
still on hand, and also for fall wool, is very
gloomy. Over 200,000,000 pounds of wool in
the Eastern markets, and nearly the whole
clip of Montana ami Oregon, which will
amount to 30,000,000 pounds, is in first
hands yet. Wooien-mills, although stopped
at present, have a good stock of wools, mostly
foreign, on hand. With the money market Id
such an unsettled condition fall wools, even if
salable, will not command very high prices.
I would advise all my friends who can keep
their sheep in good condition without shear
ing this fall not to shear, as 1 doubt if it will
pay them to do so. The only hope we have is
that the American people wilt come to their
senses and will v6te for sound money and pro
tection in November next. Every sheepman
or party interested in sheep or wool should
try his utmost to get all his friends to vote the
right way. We have had enough experience
in two years of free wool, which reduced the
production of wool in the United States not
less than 150,000,000 pounds, making paupers
of sheepmen.
Some of my friends may think that I express
too strong feeling in this matter, but this is a
time when it behooves every man who has the
welfare of his country at heart to express him
self in plain language.
Four years ago there were a good many man
ufacturers who thought that free wool would
enhance their business, but they found to their
cost that the only way to exist is under the
protective tariff, both on raw and manufac
tured materials, and to-day there is not a man
ufacturer north or south, east or west, who is
not In favor of sound money and protection.

Free Coinage of Silver
Means a Big Cut
in Wages.
A PARITY IS IMPOSSIBLE
Interview With Colonel Bendel,
Head of the Winemakers'
Corporation
HE KNOWS BY IXPEKIENCE.
Recalls the Flood of Silver in 1876-77,
When Gold Stood at a Big
Premium.
Colonel H. Bendel, president of the
Wine-makers' Corporation and of the San
Francisco Fruit Exchange, has very pro
nounced views on the money question and
in opposition to free coinage. In an inter
view yesterday he said:
"Since the \Vilson tariff bill went into
effect the balance of trade has been largely
agaicst us, hundreds of millions of dollars
being drained from this country in conse
quence. For instance, all the tin plate
factories of the United States cannot sup
ply one-tenth of the quantity needed, and
nine-tenths must be imported from Eng
land. The canning business in which I
am interested requires annually tin
plate amounting to about 20,000 pounds
sterling, or nearly $100,000 in United
States gold coin. If I should offer to pay
this amount in silver, the English sellers
would simply answer, "There is more
silver in a Mexican dollar than in an
American dollar, and as the Mexican dol
lar in your country is worth only 53 cents
in gold, why should we accept yours for
100 cents? You must either pay $100,000
in gold or its equivalent in silver, which
would amount to $i 90,000.'
"ThiÃ proves to my mind conclusively
that with an unlimited coinage of silver it
would be an impossibility to keep gold
and silver in this country at par, as it
would compel people who have payments
to make in Europe to buy gold at a pre
mium, and gradually all the gold would
be sent out of this country.
"Another article that would be seriously
affected in my line of business is sugar, of
which at least 75 per cent is imported
from foreign countries, and for the quanti
ties which we use in our factories we
would be compelled to pay about $50,000
more in silver than we would be able to
purchase the same quantity in gold for.
This $140,000 excess I should be obliged to
pay for tin and sugar would naturally
come out of tne pockets of the consumer.
Next to the consumer the laboring classes
would be seriously affected. Our payroll
is sometimes as high as $1000 per day,
which, if paid in silver, would be reduced
to $530, which 1 would consider very un
fortunate, as no country iB or can be pros
perous where labor is cheap, and when the
wages paid for labor do not keep pace with
the depreciation of silver this assertion
can be easily proven.
"In 1876 or 1877 we experienced on a small
scale whnt is now proposed to be done on
a larger basis. We had an overproduc
tion of silver on this coast and conse
quently a silver dollar was worth only 90
cents in gold on this market. The busi
ness in which I was engaged at that time
made less gross profit than the discount
on silver amounted to. and as there was
practically no gold left in circulation
among the consumers I was compelled to
deal mostly on a silver basis with my cus
tomers, as a great many retail grocers in
this City will recollect. Very few, how
ever, preferred to deal with me on a gold
basis. For instance, I would sell coffee to
a party on a gold basis at 18 cents per
pound and 20 cents per pound for silver,
and soa difference of 10 percent was made
for all merchandise sold.
"All wages, however, of the laboring
classes at that time of course were paid in
silver, and so the poor laboring man had
to pay for all the necessities of life 10 per
cent more than a few months before, when
he was paid in gold. So the laborer, in
fact, who at that time earned $3 per day in
silver actually only earned $2 70. Of
course if he had received his wages in cold
he could have bought for $2 70 in cold
just as much as for $3 in silver; and this
will prove that if we come to h silver
basis the Ja boring classes will be com
pelled to pay about twice as much for the 1
JACOB WOLLNER.
necessities of life, while it will take quite
a Ion? time before his waees will be in
creased in proportion to tile increased cost
of merchandise.
"If the rich owners of silver mines, in
whose sole interest this fight is made,
would have used their influence to have
all the fractional currency under $10 or
$20 withdrawn and replaced by silver coin
they could have conferred a great benefit
â¢ upon our silver industry. But the trouble
j is simply this, that all the advocates of
1 unlimited silver coinage at the rate of 16
to 1, not only in the Eastern, but also in
the Middle States, do not care to handle
silver, but prefer the small greenbacks on
account of silver being too bulky.
"The proposition to borrow 100 cents
and to pay back in coin whose intrinsic
value is only 53 cents is simply an act of
rascality and unworthy of a great nation,
and we might just as well put our dollar
stamp on a piece of copper or old iron,
which would leave us a still larger profit.
"In case free coinage of silver should be
adopted and the price of S5 in gold and $5
in silver kept at par (which I, of course,
believe impossible) âbut suppose this
should be the case, we should soon have
all the silver in Mexico in this country, as â¢
it would certainly be a profitable business
to buy Mexican dollars at 53 cents, melt
them into bullion and set from the United
States mint 100 cents in return.
"The people who would be largely in
jured in case the policy of free silver coin
ing should be adopted would be the con
tamer, and principally the laboring class
and such of my old comrades of the Grand
Army of the Republic who draw pensions
from the United States Government. The
purchasing power could only be one-half
lof the pension they receive now. The
widows and orphans who are holders of
life insurance policies would also be af
fected, as in case of death they would re
ceive only one-half of what they are en
titled to now. Tbe treat gainers would be
ail life insurance, fire insurance and ma
rine insurance companies and others.
"While at present our income from the
revenue department does not come near
I defraying the expenses of the Federal Gov
ernment, and if we were to receive our
duties in silver instead of gold the revenue
of course would be still further decreased
to a great extent. This would also seri
ously affect the fruit producers of this
State. At present the duty on raisins,
prunes and other foreign products is not
I more than the freight from here to our
Eastern markets, and in case Eastern im
porters would have tho privilege of paying
tbe duty of foreign products in silver it
would be impossible for the producers on
this coast, hucu as fruit, raisin and wine
growers, to compete with foreign products
produced in Europe by cheap labor.
"The reason why the owners of some of
the largest and richest gold mines are in
favor of unlimited coinage of silver is be
cause as soon as this would go into effect
they would be able to sell their gold prod
uct at an enormous premium, while they
would save perhaps $1000 per day by pay
ing_miners in silver.
"In one of our daily papers it was stated
that during the Civil War paper money
did not go Below 50 cents on tbe value of
gold, and therefore a silver doilar would
never reach that point. This is a mistake
â a gold dollar at one time during the year
1864 was sold at $2 85 legal tender, and in
1865 at $2 34% legal tender. The reason
why paper money advanced again to the
value of gold was simply because the people
had perfect confidence in our Government
that a legal tender dollar before long would
be redeemed at par in gold, and in this
supposition they were not deceived. The
Confederacy also issued paper money,
which at one time commanded a certain
value, but when it became evident later on
that the paper money of the Confederacy
could never be redeemed in gold it sank to
the value of the raw material of which it
was maae. And the same is true of silver
âso long as a silver dollar or a paper dol
lar can at any time be exchanged for the
same amount of gold it of course rep
resents the same value as gold precisely,
the same as a check eiven by a responsible
firm or a bank ; but as soon as the United
States Government is not in position or is
not willing to make this exchange the
silver dollar will gradually sink to the
value of the material of which it is made â
silver bullionâ which means 53 cents as
compared with $1 in gold.
"In silver States wages run as follows:
In Mexico the wages run from 50 cents
to $1 25 silver per dayâ the average being
about 65 cents per day, which, at the pres
ent rate of pxchane;e(lÃÃ per cent) amounts
to about 34J4 cents gold per day. The
highest wages are paid to miners and
peones working in districts remote from
civilization, but the employer being like
wise the purveyor, the men merely get
tbeir board, lodging and necessaries of life
for their work.
"The average wages in Guatemala are
50 cents silver or paper per day, which at
the present rate of exchanee'of 120 per
cent premium amounts to 22% cents gold
per day.
"In conclusion, I should iike to Btate
that there is no reason for the present un
satisfactory financial condition here as
well as in the East, even though the sil
verites should be successful; the change
which they contemplate cannot be effected
before two years from now, and I hope
that our banks and the people generally
will take a conservative view of the situa
tion and not get panic stricken over some
thing that cannot happen for nearly two
years to come."
Only 9 per cent of the soldiers actually
engaged in war are killed on the field of
battle.
Though Mr. Wollner "speaks right out
in meeting," he is by no means alone. It
is a well-known fact in San Francisco that
the wool men are a unit on this question,
irrespective of previous party affiliations.
None fail to see that the Wilson bill has
ruined their business, and many a Demo
crat engaged in the wool business will
vote for protection and prosperity this
year.
THE STATE WINS
A BIG VICTORY,
The Atlantic and Pacific
Road Must Pay Back
Taxes.
THE COURTS OPINION.
Ex-State Treasurer McDonald
Wins His Suit for the
People.
INTERSTATE LAWS DEFINED.
Tbe Receiver Claimed That the Prop
erty Had Already Been Taxed
in New Mcx co.
The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad must
pay the taxes levied by the State Board of
Equalization in 1894, amounting to $56,180.
This was decided yesterday in an opinion
rendered by Judge McKenna in the case
ofJ. W. Reinhart, receiver, against J. R.
McDonald, late Treasurer of the State of
California.
In 1894 the roll ing-stock, including ioco
motives, of the Atlantic and Pacific Rail
road used on a short line in Southern Cali
fornia was assessed at $56,180. The re
ceiver protested, alleging that tho property
in question had already been taxed in
New Mexico. Mr. Reinhart, as receiver of
the railroad, sought to test the matter in
the courts by instituting a suit against
Treasurer McDonald. Judge McKenna, in
his opinion, says:
The view that this is a suit against the State
iB presented by the Attorney-General with
great strength and plausibility, but even if
the contention be true I think it is a fair de
duction from the authorities as from the prin
ciple that the right of suit against the
Treasurer of the State being given it may be
brought in the Federal courts when other
grounds of jurisdiction exist as they do In thfs
case. Ido not think it is necessary to review
the cases; they are very numerous and the
counsel has cited all of them. The claim of
exemption from taxation ot the property de
scribed is based on the following grounds:
Firstâ That the property is engaged in inter
state commerce.
Secondâ That its situs is in New Mexico,
where taxes on it have been paid.
Thirdâ That the Atlantic and Pacific Rail,
road is not the owner of the railroad, and
under the constitution of the State of Califor
nia the rolling-stock can only be assessed to
the owner of the railroad.
The first two grounds are answered by the
cases ol Marye vs. Baltimore and Ohio Rail
road. 127 U. S. 117, and Pullman Car Company
vs. Pennsylvania. The constitution of the
State of California is as follows:
Section 1, Article XIII. All property of tbe
State, not exempt under the laws of the United
States, shall be taxed in proportion to its va:ue, 10
Up ascertained as provided by law. Tbe word
properly, as used in this article and section, is
hereby declared to Include moneys, credits, bonds,
stocks, dues, franchises, and all matters and
things real, personal and mixed capable of private
ownership. â¢ â¢ â¢
Section 10, Article XIII. The franchise, road
way, roadbed, rails and rolling-stock of All rail
roads operating in more than one county In this
State shall be assesÂ»Â«d by the State Board of
Equalization at their actual value, and the same
shall be apportioned to tbe counties, oittet and
counties, cities, towns, townships and districts in
which such railroads are located, In proportion to
tbe number of miles of railway laid in such coun
ties, cities. * * *
These provisions seem to need no interpreta
tion. Tne first section is so comprehensive it
can only be defined in terms of itself, and it
certainly embraces, as it exactly and carefully
says it embraces, all matters and things
capable of private ownership.
The court then quotes several authori
ties in support of the position taken, in
cluding the decision in the celebrated case
of Marye against tbe Baltimore and Onio
road. la conclusion, Judge McKenna says:
The language of the California constitution
is: "All property of the State, not exempt
under the laws of the United States, shall be
taxed in proportion to Its value, to he ascer
tained as provided by law."
The California constitution, therefore, ap
plies to property without regard to its kind or
ownership. It is only necessary that it should
be ot the State. The limitations of the Virginia
statute are not contained in the California
constitution.
The decision is regarded as one of utmost
importance to the State of California. The
railroads have heretofore succeeded in
evading State taxation on rolling-stock
used under similar conditions, but accord
ing to Judge McKenna this is no longer
possible. ________^___

Exhibitors Are Rushing to Be
All in Readiness for
Opening Day.
GEMS IN THE AET GALLERY.
The Names of the Intending Exhib
itors Recorded Up to Yesterday
Inc'usive â A Big Show.
A week aeo the interior of the Me
chanics' Pavilion was a barren space with
here and there an industrious individual
wielding a paint brush touching up dark
places and a few were designating by chalk
marks on the floor the spaces to be occu
pied by the many exhibitors.
Yesterday a number of booths were up,
carpenters andupholsterers were busy in
every section of the building and the fair
was in a state of advancement the like
of which was never known before at the
same time prior to the opening day.
All the available space has been bespoken
and there is a demand for more. To those
who called yesterday and announced that
they wished to show California products
Mr. Gilmore, the superintendent, said:
"We will take your application, but your
only chance is that some one who has al
ready secured a space will draw out."
There will be a magnificent display of
mirrors by the Fuller Company, Fishbeck
& GloDtz have men at work: putting up
a palace of California soap which will
- surpass any heretofore shown. The floor
will be in imitation of tiles made in soap.
The Egyptian booth in which there will be
a very large display of California made
poods will be one of the most striking ever
seen in the Pavilion. Tie San Francisco
Call will have a line display on the ground
floor near the bandstand and in the art
gallery there will be a fine exhibit of draw
ings from the art department of the paper.
To-day the elevator will be put in oper
ation, and it will be used to carry material
to the gallery floor, and that being done
work in the upper floor will commence.
Henry Raschen, who will have charge
of the art gallery, stated yesterday that
there will be exhibits of paintings, water
colors and charcoal etchings, and that
every artist will be represented. There
will also be a good loan collection. Tbe
classification of pictures, good, bad and
indifferent, will be left to the judgment of
a committee of three of their own selec
tion. These three will say which pictures
will be placed in the room allotted to the
best work, and the artists themselves will
have something to say. how their pictures
shall be hun^. E. J. Keller, a local car
â  toonist, has just finished a very striking
three-sheet poster sketch to announce the

SECOND MATE BLAMED,
Captain Johnson Shifts the Re
sponsibility for the Point
Arena's Grounding.
Lookout Andersen Reported Land
Ahead, but the Mate Said It
Was Fog.
Supervising Inspector Bermingham was
engaged yesterday in hearing testimony
relative to the grounding of the coasting
steamer Point Arena off Point Reyes on
the night of August 10. The vessel was
only on the rocks about five minutes when
it succeeded in backing off into deep
water. It however sustained considerable
damage in that brief period, which its
owners estimate at something less than
$1000.
Captain A. Johnson, master of the ves
sel, testified that he did not hear the
Point Reyes fog signal, as a current had
carried him in behind the point. He was
not on deck at the time of the catastrophe,
the second mate, Charles Wickman, hav
ing relieved him. He said he started to go
on deck about 9 o'clock at night, when he
felt a jar and realized that the vessel had
struck. He rusbed on the bridge, where
he met Wickman. He then realized by
Wlckman's manner and by his breath that
he had been drinking.
Wickman was called and denied that he
had been drinking that day, but admitted
that he had once been discharged by Cap
taii> Johnson for drunkenness. He said it
was very dark and foggy that night. About
9 o'clock he saw something dark ahead
which the lookout said was land. He told
the lookout it couldn't be land. A minute
after he shouted to the caDtain that he
guessed there was land ahead. Then came
the crash.
i'eter Andersen, the lookout, testified
that he reported land ahead about 9 o'clock,
but he was not sure whether Wickman
said, "Oh, , that'sfog." A minute after
ward they struck the rocks. He said he
noticed no sign of Wickman having been
drinking.
Charles Peterson, who was at the wheel,
testified that he had steered the course
the mate cave him, which was the usual
course at the point where they believed
themselves to be. He did not notice any
signs of Wickman being under the influ
ence of liquor.
hi answer to a question Captain John
son said be had taken no sounding since
7:30 in the morning.
The inspector annonnced that owing to
a rusb of business be would not be able to
render a decision on the case for two
weeks.
DISCUSSING POLITICS.
Andrew Sorrengon Arrested for Ob-
structing the Sidewalk.
Andrew Sorrenson, a real estate agent,
was talking politics at the corner of Eddy
and Powell streets about 7 o'clock last
night, and a crowd gathered around him.
Policeman M. F. Joy asked Sorrenson to
move ou as he was obstructing the Bide
walk.
"I am only talking politics with my
friend," replied Sorrenson.
"Well, you are attracting a crowd and
obstructing the sidewalk, so move on,"
said Joy.
"All right," said Sorrenscn.
Sorrenson did not Keep bis word, and
began to talk again, when Joy placed him
under arrest and sent him to the City
Prison, where he was booked on the charge
of obstructing the street. He gave $5 cash
bail and was released from custody.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, 1896.
CHUN MAN DOES
NOT FRIGHTEN.
Though a Price of $1000
Is Upon His
Head.
HIS SHIRT OF MAIL
To Protect Him From the As
sassins of the Tailors'
Union.
ATTEMPT TO BURN HIM OUT.
i
Tale of a Brave Manufacturer, Whom
His Lawless Countrymen
Cannot Territy.
In this enlightened age and country,
leaving the slack times out of the ques
tion, ?1000 in gold seems to be an almost
incredible price to put upon the head of
Chnn Man. the Chinese Clothing Manufacturer Upon Whose Head Some of His
Enterprising Countrymen Have Placed a Price of $1000.
a humble Chinese tailor. Such, though,
is the fact, as developed in the sequel, to
the firebug story in last Monday's Call.
Kum Yee Hong, the Chinese Tailors'
Union of Brenham place, haa posted
notices in the public streets and alleys of
Chinatown, offering to pay a reward of
$iOOO to any enterprising highbinder who
will take the life of Chun Man. He is a
manufacturer of clothing, who has in
curred the wrath of his countrymen by
equipping his factory with modern Ameri
can sewing machines, thus infringing
upon a time-honored Chinese custom,
which holds that each journeyman tailor
should own and control his own machine.
Chan Man thought that he could do
a bigger business and make money faster
by adopting American methods, and, in
consequence, the union now earnestly
| desires his extermination, and, as has been
stated, is willing to pay a liberal price for
it. In the meantime the brave manufac
turer, conscious of his own advanced ideas,
walks defiantly around Chinatown, bis
| breast protected by a chain shirt of mail,
given him by an American merchant in
token of his bravery. The Chinese do not
attach much sanctity to human Jife, es
-1 pecially among themselves, but the $1000
reward offered for the head of Chan Man
is conclusive proof of the hatred they bear
him, as well as of the latent barbarity
lurking in the nature of the Mongolian
race.
Two years ago Chun Man had aclothing
factory at 408 Sacramento street, but now
he is located at 509)Â£ Washington street.
He has here some seventy sewing-ma
chines, operated by electricity, the intro
duction of which originally aroused the
wrath of his countrymen. They have pat
a price, and a liberal price, upon bis head,
but not satisfied with this action, they are
also trying industriously to burn down his
factory, and if they cannot kill him, thus
drive him out of the clothing manufactur
ing business.
"I notified Kura Yee Hong (the tailors'
union) of my intention to use electricity
before I ordered my machines," said Chum
Man, "and was told that it would be all
right. At that time electricity was in a
factory at 828 Dupont street and another
at 631 Pacific street.
"When the machines arrived from
New York the union tried to prevent me
from setting them up and forbade any of
their men to work for me. If they did
they were assured that something dread
ful would happen to them. I said I would
return the machinery if the union would
pay me back my $200 deposit and the cost
of transportation. .President Wong Hurt
declined to compromise upon these terms
and I then appealed my case to the Chi
nese Six Companies.
"They told me I was in a legitimate
business, to go on and they would protect
me. The Chinese Consul, j"eung, also said
that in the event of any trouble my inter-'
ests wouid be looked* after by the Wy
Lung, a society for the prevention of
crime. A few days later the detectives of
the companies came to me at my place of
business and warned me not to come into
Chinatown, as notices Had been posted
offering $1000 reward to anybody who
would kill me.
"This notice emanated from the union
and has not since been recalled. An
American merchant on Battery street
gave me a chain shirt of mail and I went
on with my business as usual. I did not
stay out of Chinatown.
"In last January or February a high
binder took a contract to kill me for $1100
within three days. He was subsequently
arrested and deported to China and I am
still alive. It had been my habit to em
ploy in my factory only union men, but a
short time ago I decided to employ non
union men as well. This intensified the
hatred the union has against me and now
the plan is to burn my factory.
"Cho On, an ex-member of the union,
was taken on by Wo Kee. The union
had him arrested. He was bailed out by
his employer. He was rearrestea and I
and Wo Kee went on his bail. This is
another incident that tells against me in
the estimation of the union and explains
why my life is held at such a high value
and why the destruction of my factory
is so earnestly desired.
"Outside of the uniou I've riot an enemy
in all Chinatown. The threats against
my life have been reported to the police
and the attempt to burn my factory to
the Fire Marshal. I am not afraid and
stiall go on with my business, just as
though nothing had happened."
GEARY-STREET FRANCHISE.
Hearing of the Injunction' Proceedings
Delayed Until Thursday J' ..'" V
The case of i George R. Fletcher against
the i Board of Supervisors was called in
Judge * Daineerh'eld's court yesterday at
10 o'clock a. M., when the injunction and
writs' of review and prohibition in regard
to the Geary-street railroad franchise
were returnable. V ' ' . _
i For a time it looked as though the prose
cution had abandoned the case, for no one
appeared to argue the case in that inter
est. Attorney Van â â '.. Duzer, however,
agreed to inform the. plaintiff's lawyers, so
the matter went over until 2 o'clock. -At
that time the attorneys for -the petitioner
were still absent. Despite the protest of
Dr. Saltield of the. Richmond Improve
ment Club Attorney W. I. Brobeek of the
City and County Attorney's office, repre
senting the Supervisors, started to argue
the demurrers entered to the complaint
by the defendants. .
"The argument had hardly got under
way when ; Attorney Samuels appeared.
He said that it had been stipulated be
tween the City and County Attorney and
Fletcher's attorneys that the Supervisors
be given until August 23 to plead, and it
was not supposed that the matter of the
demurrers would be argued before Friday,
law and motion day. . . ,
.On this representation Judge Dainger
field put the bearing over until Thursday
at 10 a. m., an ; important ; case , being al
ready set for hearing on Friday.

CLARK IS 10
LONGER CAPTAIN,
The Wreck of the Colombia
Terminated His Career
as a Navigator.
HIS LICENSE REVOKED.
Supervising Inspector Berming-
ham Decides Clark Was
Guilty of Negligence.
SHOULD HAVE CAST A LEAD
The Colombia's Commander Placed
Undue Ccnfiience in Compasses
and Faint Fog Signals. '
When the steamer Colombia went crash
ing into the rocks off Pigeon Point on the
morning of July 14, not only was a stately
vessel doomed to become the plaything of
the boisterous billows, but her commander
had found in this rude landing the termin
ation of bis last voyage as master. For
Captain Clark will go down to sea as
captain no more.
Supervising Inspector Bermingham has
rendered his decision as tne result of the
inquiry into the Colombia disaster. He
rinds that on the morning of the wreck
Captain Clark was unskillful and negli
gent. In a navigator upon whose discre
tion human lives are staked such faults
are unpardonable, and the inspector has
decreed that Captain Clark's license as
master of a steamer shall be revoked.
The following is Inspector Berming
ham's decision:
Captain Clark took the stand and testified
that on July 13, at 0:30 p. M., three miles off
Point Arguello, going 13% knots, the weather
being clear, he shaped his course NW. \\ W. to
carry him about live miles outside of Point
Sur, then 119 miles distant. About 10 o'clocn
the same night fog set in very thick, liis
steam whistle was kept sounding, and at 3:25
a. m., July 14, he heard the fog whittle of Point
Sur abeam, which he and his second officer
estimated to be five miles distant. They only
heard that signal two or three times. Captain
Clark then altered his course to NW. %N.
and, after running thirty-three miles, heavy
fog still continuing, he hauled in V^ of a point
toNW. \i N., and ran on that course until he
and his third officer, John Thompson who wan
on the bridge with him, heard fog whistles
well on the starboard bow, which they again
heard abeam at 7:40 a. m., but not very dis
tinctly.
These whistles they took to be from Pigeon
Point, which they estimated to be four miles
eff abeam at that time, lie then hauled in
NW. by K. standard, NW. by N. y* N. magnetic,
lor the whistling buoy off San Francisco bar,
and at 7:30 A. M. he heard another faint
whistle on the port bow. About three or lour
minutes before 8 a. m. Third Officer Thompson
heard two or three faint blasts of & whistle, the
last blast being a little the loudest, which he
reported was irom a steamer about two points
off the port bow, and directly he saw the rocks
ahead and sung out to the captain, who or
dered the helm hard a-starboard. The Colom
bia at once struck, at 8 a. m., and became a
wreck, about half a mile ESE. of Pigeon Point
lighthouse and fog signal, which, it appears
from the testimony, was not being operated
full blast.
The Colombia was built in 1891 at Chester,
Pa., of steelâ 36lG.27 gross, 2337.45 net tons
ana was worth $425,000. Her cargo was
valued at about $125,000.
Captain Clark, la his written report of the
disaster to the United States Local Board of
Inspectors of Steam Vessels at San Francisco,
July 21, 1890, descriptive of the course steered
by him on the Colombia, states that he had
the fog signal at Point riur abeam at 3 :25 a. m.,
estimated distance five miles. In giving his
testimony before the supervising inspector
July 28, 189(>, he estimated the distance off
that point to be seven or eight miles, judging
from the sound of the whistle, but allo veil he
waÂ£ five miles off, and shaped his course NW.
magnetic, as before stated, or by compass NW.
a large l / t N. â¢
It is not improbable that the compasses of
the Colombia were influenced by local attrac
tion between Point Arguello and Pigeon
Point. It was her second trip up from Pana
ma and the lirst one in command of Captain
Clark, who testified that, so far as he knew,
the error of his compasses should have taken
him off shore, but the result shows it did not.
The compass course he steered from, three
miles off Point Arguello. may have carried
him much closer to Point Sur than he esti
mated.
The difference In the courses at from five
miles off shore at Point Sur to live miles off
Pigeon Point, and from the same distance off
Point Sur to Pigeon Point (tifty-eight miles)
is about one-quarter of a point; but, from two
and a half miles off Pigeon Point, less than
one-eighth of a point northerly variation in
his compasses would have carried him inside
Pigeon Point.
Captain Clark alleges that he was carried in
shore by what he termed an "Inset," that is to
say, a current running inshore across his
course. If this were so, there must have been
at the time a movement of the waters there
aoouts that did not exist seven or eight hours
previously, when the steamer Santa Rosa passed
in that locality. Captain E. Alexander, who was
in command of the Santa Rosa, testified in this
case as to bis long experience in currents and
fog whistles in that vicinity. He passed Point
Sur four miles off, in the same dense fog exper
ienced by Captain Clark, at 8:15 p. m. the pre
vious day and shaped his course N. 41 deg.
W., (NW. 14 N.) and made Pigeon Point
whistle abeam, estimated distance four miles,
at 1 :25 A. M. The correctness of his estimated
distances from those points were verified by
his subsequent movements.
It is clear Captain Clark relied too much on
the accuracy of his compasses. A more skill
ful master would have got n cast of his lead
after crossing the mouth of Monterey Bay,
before shaping his course during a dense
fog for the whistling buoy off San Francisco
bar. A cast of the lead at any time after 7a. m.
would have pointed out the error of his judg
ment as to his distance off shore. He did
not use the lead, rather preferring to be guided
by what proved unreliable sounds from fog
whistles. What was the result? He, besides
jeopardizing the lives of those on board his
ship, drove her at full speed to her destruc
tion on the rocKs.
Possibly the fog whistles at Point Ano Nuevo
and Pigeon Point wer3 not going full blast
about that time, and so deceived them as to
their distance. But that is poor consolation for
his owners, or others interested. Manager
Sohwerin of the P. M. 8. 8. Co. testified that he
had given Captain Claric imperative instruc
tions to take no risks in a fog. and said to him
that It was very much easier to find the bottom
with the lead than with the ship's keel, which
Captain Clark will now concede to be a truism.
After careft'l consideration of the foregoing
the Supervising Inspector is of the opinion
that Captain W. A. Clark did, on the morning
of July 14. 1896, negligently snd unskiUfully
navigate the steamer Colombia, then under
his command, by hugging the shore and
causing her wreck near Pigeon Point, Califor
nia, without getting a cast of lead, all the
while going at full speed in a dense fog, con
trary to tue provisions of rule 21, section
4233, United States Revised Statutes, which
provides that every steam vessel shall, when
in a fog, go at a moderate speed.
For such negligence and unskillfulness and
violation of said rule 21 on the part of said
W. A. Clark the Supeivising Inspector hereby
revokes his license as master Of steam vessels,
and he is hereby forbidden to exercise the du
ties prescribed in his said certificate.

CRITICIZED THE BOARD.
The Supervisors Taken to Task by the
Secretary of a Canning- Company.
A communication, dated August 2, criti
cizing the Board of Supervisors for not
granting the Board of Health more money
to conduct its department was filed yes
terday with Secretary Russell.
The writer, Isador Jacobs, who signs
himself as secretary of the California
Canneries Company, is apparently ignor
ant of the fact that at a meeting of the
Supervisors on the 3d inst. the Health
Department appropriation was raised |
at the instance of Supervisor Spreckels
about $9000 over the sum originally fixed,
anil therefore bis assumption contained
in tlie letter that "apparently the public
health does not count with the Board of
Supervisors" would seem to be uncalled
for, particularly as Mr. Jacobs has not the
slightest connection, in an official way,
with the Board of Health, though he
often appears at the office to urge investi
gations of Eastern fruit products that are
sold in this market.

RATES SLASHED
IN THE VALLEY.
A New Schedule by the
Southern Pacific
Company.
MANY RATES HALVED.
An Object Lesson on the Results
of Competition by the
Valley Road.
COMPETITIVE FIGURES MET.
Why Hauling Will Be Done Much
Cheaper in One Region in
This State.
The freight department of the Southern
Pacific Company yesterday issued a new
.freight rate sheet, cutting pretty nearly in
two the freight rates between San Fran
cisco and Stockton and the shipping
points in the San Jo&quin Valley affected
by the competition of the San Francisco
and San Joaquin Valley Railroad Com
pany, which announced its low schedule of
freight rates some days ago.
No more vivid object lesson on the need
and the effect of railroad competition has
ever been presented to the State of Cali
fornia. No more compact and vivid illus
tration of the need of the competing Valley
road in the San Joaquin Valley, its benefi
cent effect and its value to the regions to
which it may be extended, has yet been
put in form.
A week or more ago Traffic Agent Moss
of the Valley road announced a schedule
of freight rates between San Francisco as
one terminal, Stockton as another termi
nal and the various new stations on the
Valley road from Stockton south to Le
Grande, within a few miles of Fresno.
Rates to Fresno may not be issued for
some time owing to the pending right-of
way difficulties, which pievent the new
road from reaching and using the station
facilities planned for it in Fresno.
But the interesting and sicniticant fact
is that the Southern Pacific Company has
been forced to cut in the middle its freight
rates throughout a small section of Cali
fornia which has been reached by compe
tition. ThiÃ section of the State so blessed
has a somewhat elliptical shape, and ex
tends in the main from Stockton south to
Berenda, which is twenty-five miles this
side of Fresno. It includes the region
served by the Southern Pacific branch
line from Stockton to Milton and the re
gion also served by the West Side South
ern Pacific line from Peters, on the Milton
branch, down the valley to Merced.
It is mainly be iween these lines of the
Southern Pacific Company from Stockton
south that the new Vflley road extends,
and it is this 'region, now served by two
companies, which enjoys the halved rates
now put in force as a result of competition.
The region thus descrioed is a little less
than a hundred miles long and its width
is regulated on the east by the com
parative nearness of the Southern Pacific's
east side line and on the west it extends
into the mountains as far as anybody has
been dependent on the transportation fa
cilities afforded by the Southern Pacific
Company from its branch line westward
from Stockton to Milton south almost to
Fresno.
Everywhere else in the State and on its
system the local freight rates remain un
changed.
The new Southern Pacific rate sheet is
sued yesterday under the supervision of
Assistant Freight Agent G. W. Luce af
fects points only as far south as Berenda,
which is 178 miles from San Francisco by
the Southern Pacific route, 98 miles south
of Stockton and 29 miles north of Fresno.
This new schedule quotes rates from both
San Francisco and Stockton to all points
on the main line south of Stockton to
Berenda on the Milton branch, and on
the west side branch from Peters south
to Merced.
In this new schedule the Valley road
rates published some days ago are simply
met at competitive points. The rates, like
those of the Valley road, are based on the
Western classification. Special rates on
commodities specifically excepted from
the classification will be announced later.
These rates have nothing to do with grain
shipments, the rates for which were early
announced by the Valley road and
promptly met by the Southern Pacific.
Shippers who wish to know the new
rates will consult railroad agents, but
those interested in a general way in what
has happened may understand it from the
following selections from the new South
ern Pacific schedule, figures in brackets
being the old rates:

Tnese and tne similar rates from other
points correspond almost exactly to the
rates issued by the Valley road for com
petitive points. In many cases the Valley
road rates are a trifle lower than those
quoted by the Southern Pacific and in a
few rare cases the Southern Pacific car
load rates are a very little lower than
those of its competitor.
"Wherever our rales are higher we shall
come down," said Traffic Manager Moss
of the Valley road yesterday.
Among the most important articles of
shipment which go into the San Joaquin
Valley are agricultural implements, which
are in class A, and the reduction in rates
in which can be seen by reference to the
table given. Dry goods and clothing are
scheduled in the first class as a rule, and
most groceries go in the second class.
Soap, which is one of the important arti
cles of freight traffic, is in the fourth class.
The large reductions thus made by the
Southern Pacific Company, however, affect
but a small portion of California, and fur
ther announcements of similar reductions
will accompany the progress of the Valley
road.

This meet will doubtless attract many
crack riders, as the San Jose wheelmen
and the third-of-a-mile-track there are
both very popular witn the racing men
and the public.
The Garden City Cyclers will shortly
inaugurate a series of Saturday afternoon
meets on their track, and some in the
evening by electric light, during the fail
months. It is believed that matinee
racing can be made to pay there. During
the winter, when many of the Eastern
cracks will go to San Jose to try for
records, meets will also be held.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen will have
a theater party at the California to-night
and nearly all the seats have already been
taken by the members and their friends.
The prizes run in their road race last Sun
day will be distributed after the perform
ance.
Frank H. Kerrigan, chief counsel of the
league in this State, has returned from his
vacation trip to Lake County.
There will be a meeting at the Imperial
Cycling Club, 614 Van Ness avenue, to
morrow night, at which tne delegates ap
pointed by tbe various cycling clubs of
this City will meet to discuss the political
situation and decide upon whom they will
support as the wheelmen's candidates.
The Reliance Club Wheelmen of Oak
land will have a theater party at the Mac
donough next Mondoy evening, August 24.
Delegates from the various cycling clubs
of Alameda County will meet to-night at
tbe Acme Club to arrange the details of
the proposed fifteen-mile roadrace for
riders of that county.
The trustees of the Mechanics' Institute
have set apart Friday, September 4, as a
special bicycle day at the Mechanics' Fair.
Complimentary tickets will be issued to
ciub members' in uniform, and they will
give an elegant trophy to the club having
the largest number of members present.
A committee composed of one delegate
from each club will arrange the details of
the affair.
Entries for the big meet to be held next
Saturday afternoon at Central Park close
to-night with Manager Fawcett, and none
will be accepted after then. A great deal
of interest is being manifested in the meet
among the club members, and the match
race between Jones and Terrill is the one
topic of conversation. There will prob
ably be a good deal of betting on this
event, as the friends of these riders are
legion and they are about evenly matched.
OVERCOATS FOR NOTHING,
How Newsboys Were Enabled
to Give Them Away
Yesterday.
Clay Street Excited Over a Generous
Distribution of Useless
Gossamers.
"Buy a paper and get an overcoat free,"
yelled an excited newsboy, as he dashed
up and down Montgomery street, between
Clay and Sacramento, yesterday afternoon
about 5 o'clock, with a bulky bundle of
evening papers under one arm and a still
heavier package of gossamer waterproof
coats under the other.
Passers by looked at him in amazement,
for the most glaringly advertised fire sale
never offered any such inducements as
that, and their surprise was increased
when half a dozen other boys appeared
similarly laden and with like appeals for
custom. Not a few pedestrians took ad
vantage of the bargains and received coats
and papers in exchange for their nickels.
There was no question of the coats being
genuine, but the trouble was to use them.
All were neatly folded, but so stuck to
gether by the influence of heat that it was
impossible to separate them, and the ma
jority were soon tossed away by the dis
gusted purchasers after the garments had
been torn in vain efforts to separate skirts
from sleeves or from each other.
The manner in which the boys acquired
possession of the coats was as laughable
as their customer's efforts to loosen the
folds of the gossamers.
Just before 5 o'clock an express wagon
heavily laden drove up in front of one of
the many employment offices that flourish
along the north side of Clay street, between
Montgomery and Kearny. The driver
looked around fora moment and then said
to a young man who looked curiously at
his load:
"Want a rain coat?''
Of course the fellow wanted a rain coat,
though rainy weather is still far distant,
and he promptly came forward to receive
the present. News of that kind spreads
quickly and before he had had time to
take a careful look at his prize others
came forward and seeing that there was
no objection began to select coats for
themselves. Next the crowds of men
loitering about the employment offices
rushed in for a share and were followed
by dozens from the saloons opposite.
Men walking along Montgomery and
Kearny streets half a block distant each
way caught the infection and joined the
throng, and inside of three minutes the
wagon was surrounded by a pushing,
shouting, perspiring mob, fighting for
coats.
Before the load, which contained several
hundred garments, was exhausted the ex
pressman became frightened for fear that
the crowd collected by his generosity
might cause his arrest for obstructing
the street, and drove away, followed by
the portion of the crowd that was un
satisfied.
The driver did not tell where he ac
quired the coats, but it was surmised that
some, burned-out firm of clothiers had
taken this method of getting rid of use
less gossamers. ..- â â¢.â¢â "â¢""â

FEW SEALS ABB TAKEN.
Discouraging Reports From th* Slttt off
Pribyloff Islands.
SEATTLE, Wash., Aug 17.â The steam
ship Portland, Captain William Kidston,
arrived in port to-day from St. Michaels
and Unalaska, bringing advices from the
latter place to August 7.
The revenue cutter Rush dropped down
upon Unalaska on August 6 from the seal
ing grounds off Pribyloff Islands. There
are some seventy sealing schooners on the
grounds this season, so the commander of
the Rush reported, and of these about
sixty-five are.flying the British flag.
Owing to very unfavorable weather, not
to exceed two or three seals to the
schooner had, up to August 6, been
killedâ the season opened on August 1
whereas under ordinarily favorable con
ditions each vessel would capture af many
as a hundred seals in that length of time.
Captain Kidston says the water is very
cold in and around the island, preventing
the seals from making their appearance,
owing to the prevalence of ice from the
Yukon and the Arctic as late as July 10.
The Government Seal Commission
headed by Dr. David Starr Jordan, was
preparing to leave Unalaska on the Rush
for a cruise to the sealing fleet when the
Portland sailed.

ACTIVE PREPARATIONS.
Possibilities of the Two Univer
sity Teams for the Com
ing Season.
THE MATERIAL IN SIGHT.
Berkeley Has Lost Most of Her Old
Line and Stanford Most of
V Her Backs.
The prospects of the two big university
football teams that will meet on Thanks-
Day* E. Brown of Oakland, Coast Champion Mile Runner, and Manager of the
Stanford Football Team.
giving Day for their sixth annual match
game are already being studied with keen
interest by the partisans of each college,
The University of California practically
began the fall term yesterday ; but foot
ball practice will not commence at Berkeley
before September 15, and Coach Butter
worth will arrive from the East two weeks
later to take the men in hand after they
have gone through the preliminary lim
bering up under the direction of Captain
Ransome and such volunteer coaches from
among the graduates as may offer their
services. Stanford University will not
open until the first of next month, but her
athletes will be out on the field fully as
early as their rivals across the bay, for the
Palo Alto coach is to arrive October 1.
All that is known at present as to his
identity is that he is not Walter Camp, the
"Father of football," and the veteran
Yale coach who has instructed the Stan
ord men for three seasons.
Just how the two college teams stand at
the opening of the season may be seen by
the following table, which indicates what
veterans will try for their old positions
and what places must be filled owing to
vacancies due to graduation and to other
causes. The figures after each name desig
nate the man's playing weight:
V. C. Positions. Stanford.

R. end L Jeffs, 146
Kennedy, 147 Quarter
U haHR
Sherman, 140 R. lialf J, Dole, 180
Capt- Ransome, 184. Fullback
Each eleven has lost six men. Berkeley
will have to build up a new center; Stan
ford will be strong there in the experience
of her men, but will have to fill all the
positions back of the line with material
from her last season's second eleven,
which Walter Camp so carefully trained
in preparation for the future. Dole him
self, the coast champion pole vaulter, was
really a second eleven man, having taken
part in last year's match only near the
end of the game when the veteran Frank
enheimer was retired from the field lame
and exhausted.
There is a possibility that Berkeley may
not lose the services of her last year's
guards, Plunkett and Walthall, who,
though now students of the Affiliated Col
leges in this City, are still eligible to play.
There seems to be a good deal of doubt,
however, as to whether the men them
selves care to train under the difficulties
incident to their residence far from the
college campus. Of Berkeley's other old
players who will not put on the padded
suit this year there are: Reinhardt, tackle,
who is now football manager; Douglass,
tackle, back in his former position in the
mines at Angels Camp; Wilson, end,
graduated and out of college, and Hupp,
halfback, again in coilege but unwilling to
play because of severe injuries received
last season. But for one tackle's position
tne Berkeley men are sure of Simpson, 185
pounds, the promising player who was
barred last year for scholastic reasons. The
vacant halfback position may be filled by
Hall, 164 pounds, 'or by Carr, 154 pounds,
both substitutes last year. Then there
are Kaarsberg. a substitute back ; Bender,
a substitute quarter; Greisberg, a second
eleven man; "Giddy" Wilder, the substi
tute quarter, who played in the big match
of '94, when he and Harrelson were put in
the game after the Berkeley and Stanford
quarters had been ruled off for losing
their tempers. Then for new men so far
known there are Dickie, who was a substi
tute back for the University of Chicago
team last year; Anderson, a halfback
from the Oakland High School; Kingdon,
192 pounds, last year s Olympic Club cen
ter, who, as a student in the College
of Pharmacy it> eligible; Whipple,
a back from the Centerville High School,
and Birdsell, a big, short fellow from
Sacramento, who weighs 215 pounds at
present, but who has declared his inten
tion to train down, harden up and try for
center rush.
In addition to these players, Captain
Ransome said yesterday that he has
noticed a good many big, heavy fresh
men, although be knows nothing of any
of them so far. ' 'But they appear to be the
kind we want," he said. "Big center men
are what we most need. Berkeley has
always had plenty of backs and ends.
From what 1 can see so far, the class of
1900 has better football material in it than
last year's freshman clsss had."
The Stanford team lost by graduation
Spalding, end; Campbell, tackle; Code,
quarter; Reynolds and Frankenheimer,
halfbacks, and Cochran, fullback, and
none of these men will return to college.
It was said last season that Camp had
trained up a second eleven at Palo Alto
that was almost as good as the varsity.
Among the exceptionally promising men
was Fisher, a halfback, who developed
too late to make the team but early
enough to make the veteran halfbacks ap
prehensive of their positions. Another
likely back was Ben Thomas. The work
of Mclntosh (138 pounds), captain of last
year's freshmen team, as a daring,
dashing quarter, makes him a prob
ability for that position in the
varsity. Rice (172 pounds), for the
last three years one of the most
conscientious players in tbe Stanford foot
ball squad, will be a strong candidate for
the vacant tackle position. Wilbur, tbe
giant shot-putter and hammer-thrower,
who entered the university after the foot
ball season was over, will try for a place
in the line, probably tackle or guard,
having played the latter position in the
Olympic Club team last year. He weighs
about 195 pounds and is powerfully built.
In addition, there are Harrington, 187
pounds, substitute guard last year and a
promising man; Bunker, 155 pounds, a
second eleven man, who played for the
Reliance Club part of last season, and
Hughes, Holbrook, Arnold and Straight,
all lively light men.
Soper, a resident of Honolulu who was
absent from college last season, developed
later in the year into a punter of unusual
ability, kicking forty and fifty yards regu
larly. To him the fullback position may
go this year.
For new men, so far known, ; Stanford
will have Murphy, a quarterback from
Salem, Or.; Harry Scoville, a Kiverside
High School player who weighs 175 pounds
and is solidly built; Sheeny, a big San
Francisco boy who weighs 200 pounds and
can run a hundred yards in less than
eleven seconds, and perhaps Perkins of
Southern California, a man who attended
the Case School of Applied Sciences in the
East last year; a brother of Clemans, Stan
ford's football hero and captain of '92; and
"Pogey" Griffiths, a player from St. Mat
thew's School at San Mateo. Clemans will
Cry for the football team, his brother
writes, and is sure of making the baseball
team. He spent the last year in one of the
colleges of the Oliio Valley. Griffiths is
now a lively baseball player.
Manager Dave Brown of the Stanford
team said yesterday that he purposes to
have two football fields ready for use as
â oon as college opens. He believes that
many of the cany accidents of each season
have been due largely to the poor condi
tion of the field when the beginners first
got out.
Brown is an Oakland boy and all bis
earlier schooling was obtained in that
city. While at the High Bchool he de
veloped into a wonderful runner and be
fore his graduation in December, 1892, had
won thirteen medals in contests with
many of thÂ« best distance men on the
coast. Immediately after leaving the
High School he entered Stanford and for
the last four seasons has been a member
of the varsity track athletic team.
In 1895 under his captaincy the founda
tion was laid for the excellent team that
competed with the Berkeley champions
this year and divided honors evenly.
Brown was energetic amd enthusiastic,
and through his efforts what was the
mere outline of a cinder track at Stanford
for several years was converted into a use
ful reality.
Last season Brown was manager of the
track team. His success in the past made
him the logical candidate for the responsi
ble managerial position he now holds. Dur
ing his three arid a half years at college
Brown has distinguished himself as a
mile-runner, having on several occasions
lowered his own coast record for the mile,
which stands to-day at 4 mm. 36 sec.,
although he has covered the distance in
practice in 4 minutes 29 seconds. Not
large, Brown is one of the few persons
that would be taken for a record-breaking
athlete. He is 21 years of age, 5 feet 7}Â£
inches in height, and weighs 145 pounds,
rie is an exceptionally good judge of pace
and seems to run naturally and without
exertion.
Strange to say, his younger brother,
Everett Brown, thiÃ year's track captain
at Berkeley, is also an unusually fine half
mile and mile runner. But though the
brothers attend rival universities they
have never yet decided their relative
speed in a race for that purpose.
ATTORNEY QUIIZOW'S ANSWER
Denies That He and Hl* Wife Swindled
Carpenter Clane.
Attorney H. W. Quitzow yesterday filed
his answer to the suit of Carpenter John
Clune, who alleges that Quitzow swindled
him out of tBIOS.
Quitzow denies severally and collectively
the allegations ol the plaintiff. He says
that Clune resided in his (Quitzow's)
house of his own volition and was not so
licited to come there. It is acknowledged
that in 1890 and 1891 Quitzow received
irom Cluno $2825 for stock of the River,
Harbor and Canal Dredging and Land
Company, but he says that the stock be
longed to Quitzow and was not purchased
by him for Uiune. It was not transferred to
Clune because he requested that it be left
in Quitzow's name.
For a further and separate answer, it is
alleged that the clause is invalidated by
the statute of limitation.
In regard to the Emigrant mining prop
erty, all the allegations of the plaintiff are
denied. It is also claimed that the case
has already beeu tried and decided in
favor of Quitzow by Judge Troutt.

SAN FRANCISCO'S
WEIGHT OF TAXES
Merchants Trying to Have
It Kept as Low as
Possible.
ASK FOB MORE TIME.
Preparing for the Meeting of the
State Board of Equali
zation.
IN DANGER OF A 810 RAISE.
A Committee Appointed to Protect the
City â Resolutions and
Telegrams.
The Merchants' Association, aroused to
unusual activity by the prospect of having
the last assessment of property in San
Francisco raised by the State Board of
Equalization, called a atfeeting of business
men and taxpayers yesterday.
The meeting was held in the assembly
rooms of the Mills building and was a
thoroughly representative gathering. The
real estate men attend -d in force and to
gether represented over $200,000,000 worth
of taxable real estate in this City.
The result of the meeting was a tele
gram to Sacramento asking that the State
board delay action until San Francisco
can properly present her case, a series of
resolutions which clearly announce the
sentiment of the men assembled and the
appointment of a committee of five to
take up the City's fight and carry it
through.
The telegram sent was as follows:
Ban Fkancisco, Aug. 17, 1896.
To the State Board of Equalization, State Cap
itol, Sacramento: The Mayor, the chairman oi
the City Board of Equalization, the Assessor's
office and the Merchants' Association respect
fully request an extension of two weeks' time
in which they wish to be heard relative to
subject of valuations in this City, inasmuch as
the assessment as now made is known to be in
excess of true values. Address immediately to
Mekchantb 1 Association.
The resolutions were as follows :
Whereas, It appears from reliable data fur
nished by the property-owners of the City and
County of San Francisco that the assessed val
uation of property in San Francisco exceeds
In many instances its actual value; and
whereas, the assessment roll has been increased
In the present fiscal year 10 about $357.
--000,000, being an increase ol about $30,000,
--000 over the assessed valuation of the past fis
cal year in spite of the general depression;
and whereas, the present assessed valuation of
property in San Francisco is comparatively
higher than in other counties throughout the
State; therefore, be it
Resolved, By the members of the Merchants'
Association and the property-owners of San
Francisco, in meeting assembled this seven
teenth (17th) day of August, 1896, that the
State Board of Equalization be hereby earn
estly and urgently requested to forego any in
crease in the present assessed valuation of
property In the City of San Francisco; and
belt
Resolved, That we appeal to the sense of jus
tice of the State Board of Equalization, and
express our confidence in any action they may
take respecting the assessment of this City,
and if any alteration is mode in the present
assessment that it be in the nature ot a reduc
tion instead of an increase, because of depre
ciation in real estate.
The committee appointed consists
of M. A.; Rothchild, O. F. yon Rhein,
James Kelly, A. S. Baldwin and Colonel
Little.
The action of the merchants was taken
because at present the Board of Super
visors, which is the proper body to attend
to such matters, is on a vacation, and un
less the matter was attended to at once it
was as well not to do anything.
President Dohrmann opened the proceed
ings by explaining the situation, and an
nounced as the object of the meeting the
solution of the question, "What was to be
done to prevent the assessment from be
ing raised?" He then asked A. S. Bald
win to address the meeting.
Mr. Baldwin said it had been the policy
of the State board to take certain sales of
property and upon them to base the rate
of assessment. In doing so, he continued,
the board takes only those sales which
illustrate and lead to the point
sought to be made. The entire assess
ment, he said, should not be raised just
because some assessments are irregular,
but, he remarked, that was just what was
being done.
The assessment-roll of this City, he said,
Is a farce. No city in the Union has a roll |
so irregular, so inaccurate and so useless.
Some property, he went on, had been sold
for less than the assessed valuation, and
he asserted that, if such a thing were pos
sible, if all San Francisco should be sold
it would not bring the amount at which it
is now assessed. And this figure will be
raised at Sacramento unless sorneihing be
done. He suggested appointing a com
mittee to collect data to submit to the
State board.
Thomas Magee then spoke. He said
that the real-estate men of the City are
always willing to help the Assessor, but
they had not been called upon. Mr.
Siebe, he continued, had promised the
non-partisans that he would seek such
information when making assessments
but he had never done so.
Then Mr. yon Rhein moved that the
chairman, Mr. Dohrman, and Colonel
Taylor of the Supervisors, Colonel Little
representing the Mayor, and Mr. Briggs
representing the Assessor, should be ap
pointed a committee to seek further time
from the State board. He wished at least
two weeks.
Mr. Briggs of the Assessor's office was
then called for to speak to the motion.
Mr. Briggs was not prepared to say
whether or not San Francisco could secure
more time. His office, he continued, had
furnished all the data possible, and it
could do no more. Continuing, he said
that the assessments this year had been in
a great measure based on the sales of 1894
and 1895, and they were undoubtedly a
little irregular. He said, too, there was
no doubt but that San Francisco was
assessed fully 15 per cent higher than any
other city or county in the State.
Regarding remarks made that property
was being assessed too high, he said that
if any one who believed an over-assess
ment had been made would come out to
the office and show where such existed the
Assessor would be glad to hear from him
and consider the question.
One gentleman asked Mr. Briggs who
made the assessment. He believed Mr.
Bripgs made the assessment himself, and
he had found that Mr. Briggs had beeu
very hard to approach.
Air. Dohrman declined tp hear anything
of the past, but Mr. Magee believed that it
was necessary to show to the State board
that the Assessor and the Assessor's office
were alone the cause of the over assess
ments. Such pertinent questions, how
ever, were ruled out. It was a future con
dition, not one past, that confronted them,
the chairman said.
Colonel Taylor said that in the absence
of the board committees were taking
action. As chairman of the Board of
Equalization of San Francisco he did not
intend to go to Sacramento, but he would
write a letter. He would call attention to
the fact that the assessment roll of tb c
City had been increased $30,000,000 within
the last year and that real estate is now
worth less than it was a year ago, and
much less than it was two years since, and
not over 60 per cent of what it was three
years ago. Such a letter would go this
morning to Sacramento, he said.
Continuing, he said he would not ad
vise to send a delegation, but he would
send the ideas of the Merchants' Associa
tion in black and white. He had not much
of an opinion of the effect of a delegation,
and he thought a letter would be Detter.
Colonel Taylor said he would have no ob
jection to ask for delay.
Mr. Briggs was then asked if he would
join in the request for delay. He said the
Assessor's office would join in anything of
that kind, but he did not think any delay
would be granted.
Mr. Rothschild then offered as a substi
tute for Mr. yon Rhein's motion that a
telegram asking further time be sent, and
a committee of five be appointed to take
charge of the affair, and in case of time
being granted to appear before the board
in person if necessary, and also to prepare
a statement for the board's action.
After some discussion Mr. Rothschild's
motion prevailed and Mr. Dohrman ap
pointed the committee. The members at
once drew up their chairs to the table and
started the formulation of the resolution
and ihe telegram, which were afterward
adopted by the meeting.

LARGE AUDIENCES,
Plays Produced for the
First Time in This
City.
FUN AT THE BALDWIN.
The " Gay Parisians" Won the
Tribute of a Night of
Laughter.
"TROVATORE" IS WELL SUNG.
At Ail the Local Theaters the Per
formances Were Received With
Approval.
The week at the Baldwin Theater opened
with a large and fashionable attendance
last evening. This large and fashionable
audience laughed the greater part of the
evening while the curtain was up over the
fun-making situations found in "The Gay
Parisians." Many laughed until there
were tears in their eyes. There is no ques
tion that "The Gay Parisians" is funny,
and that means that it will have a good
run. That it has any other merit would
not be claimed for it. The plot has already
been given.
The incidents all center around the old
device of "a night out" in a restaurant, in
which some of the parties fear that they
will be compromised by having their iden
tity discovered. The first act i 3 merely
introductory and the third act is devoted
to clearing up the mysterious occurrences
of the second act.
W. J. Ferguson, although in poor
voice, made the part of Joseph Pioglet
vivacious beyond the actual merit of his
lines and did some very clever pantomim
ing. James 0. Barrows with his standing
part of Mathieu was excruciatingly droll.
Sadie Martinot as Mrs. Paillard bad
all the opportunity afforded her
that was necessary by singular
and embarrassing happenings to call forth
the ready and willing indorsement of
hearty laughter. Margaret Gordon was a
very trim and attractive maid as Vic
tonare. Some of the best work was done
by Mrs. E. J. Phillips as Angsline, the
wife of Pioglet, who filled the unwelcome
role of the henpecking wife.
The title of the play carries the impres
sion that the whole is a mass of amusing
absurdities. There is little of originality
in anything excepting the dialogue and
the fact that the playwright, seeing many
plays of a similar sort preceding, has
seemingly resolved to make a composite
of them all, but that does not matter
when the purpose of the work is
concerned. It is probable that the fun
niest lecture that could be written or de
livered would be reached by having a
dozen wits collaborate. The fact is com
mented on, somewhat curiously, that
" The Gay Parisians " has no known
author. The real wonderment would
be if any one person would claim
its authorship. The hypothesis is reason
able that some manager commanded that
the effect of the composite order of fun
should be tried on. It is true that there
are two authors given, whose names figure
on the programme, but it is also alleged
that they had nothing to do with it.
The fact is that "Tae Gay Parisians"
was complied rather than composed on
the general theory that many beads are
better than one. The work was not ail
even. Charles B. Wells as Paillard was
not particularly amusing. The perform
ance of even Sadie Martinot at times
seemed perfunctory. But the general
effect was, as before has been said, to
make the audience laugh, and that is all
the piece was ever intended to accomplish.
The California Theater.
The production of "The Minstrel of Clare" at
the California Theater last evening was greeted
by a good bouse, but not bo good a house as
this delightful play deserves. It is a scene of
IrlEh life, In which is depicted some villainy,
much love, and a rollicking Bon of the old sod
is In evidence. This last, Larry O'Lynn in the
csst. Is assumed by Chauncey Olcott, whose
portrayal of the character was marked by a
naturalness that caused many in the audience
to give vent to the expression, "that's a true
Irish lad for you."
In the audience there were Knights of the
Red Branch, Knights of Tara and members of
the Knights of the Red Branch Rifles, not in
the regalia or uniform of these organizations,
but in their capacity as civilians accompanied
by wives, sweethearts or relatives, and they
numbered 200.
During the performance Mr. Olcott sang
"The Minstrel Boy," "Love Remain* the
Same" and other airs with much sweetness
find pathos, but the one that captured the
audience was the "Home" song, which car
ries the sentiment expressed in John
Howard Payne's "Home, Sweet Home." The
air is catchy, and after the play was
over hundreds of Individuals whistled
the refra in. Admirers of the sweet singer pre
sented him with a large floral flag with the
Inscription, '-The Knights of Tara," and with
two other large floral pieces.
Luke Martin, who takes the part of Matt
Dugan, a sort of Michael Feeney character,
acted his part well, and Georgia Busby was
vÂ«-ry acceptable as Nellie Cregan. The play is
deserving of good patronage.
At the Columbia.
That very funny comedy the "Great Un
known" began its second week at the Colum
bia last evening to a good house. Blanche Bates
was at her best and every word and gesture
were charmingly humorous. She is affectionate,
slangy, piquant, impulsive and bright. Hope
Ross, as Pansy, her siater, is a very bad, nice
little eirl, and is an excellent running mate
for Etna, the clever Blanche. Harry Corson
<lÂ»rke and Wilton Lackaye were better ana
Finootherin their roles than last week. The
play will be continued tue remainder of the
week.
Verdi's "II Trovatore."
Last evening the Tlvoli Opera-House began
its seventh week of the grand opera sefeson
under the direction of Gustav Hinrichs with
"Jl Trovatore." Signor Fernando Michelena
sung the noble lines of Manrico, and well, and
Mme. Natali the sad, sweet numbers
of Leonora. Signor Maurice de Vries
was the Count Oi Luna, and Miss
Bernice Holmes was the gypsy's daughter,
Azucena. Verdt'a beeutiml melody was, aa
Jt always Is, the hit of the season. Mme.
Natali was exceptionally good, and her execu
tion of tne very difficult music with which this
role abounds marked her as a diva of culture
and splendid voice. iiÂ«t-Â»
Michelena and Manrico shared the honors
with her. and in the final act both of these ar
tists came in for a weli-deeerved ovation.
Maurice de Vries gathered fresh laurels as
the count. His performance was admirable in
It had been intended that Flora Finlayson
should appear as Azeena. Owing to illness
shÂ« was nnable to do so, but her place was ca
pably supplied by Bernice Holmes, who is en.
titled to great credit, the more so when it is
considered she only had forty-eight hours to
perfect herself in the part. The remaining
characters were competently rendered.
"Trovatore" will go all the week. To-night
Nina Bertina Humphreys will appear as
Leonora. Mlbs Fiulayaoa will sing in Azu
cena's role to-morrow evening. TheTivoll was
well filled with the lovers of melody, as it de
served.
The Orpaenm.
The Orpheum, with its Black Patti, the Nel
son Sisters, Biondi, Kennedy, the funny mes
merist, and the clever cat performers, was
pacited last night. The new people
were Mildred Howard, a very graceful
and fine-appearing dancer, with her pretty
Trilby feet patterinsr unstockiuged over the
boards. Sydney de Gray, a fine barytone, was
auother frefh feature of the entertainment.
The Dresent bill will coutinue tbe rest of the
week.
Grand Opera-House.
It is seldom tbat on a Monday night the
Grand Opera-house Is as crowded as it was last
night on tbe occasion of the presentation of
that patrlotio naval play, "The Ensign," in
which James M. Brophy appeared in the
title role. The play is well known
to San Francisco theater-goers, but
they do not seem to tire of it. At this bouse it
was well put on and some of the efforts of the
scenic artists won the audience to loud plau
dits. In the scene ftt the close of the trial of
the ensign, when he arose ai>d declared that it
was he who had killed the English lieutenant
for insulting the American flag, '^c pent-up
patriotism of the audience burst forth of one
accord and for a few moments there was the
wildest enthusiasm.
The curtain had 10 be raised three times on
the tableau. The presentation of President
Lincoln by Harry Benrimo was also loudly ap
plauded, and on" this soeue the curtain had to
be raised lour times. Little Mildred, the child
actress, was, as usual, excellent, in the part
she assumed. As a whole, the others were well
up in the work demanded oi them.
The Chutes.
There was a good audience at the chutes last
night, and the performance in the Casino by
Billy Harvey, Mollie Stockmeyer, the Masons
and Tumbieronicon Wesion greatly enter
tained the audience. Joe, the cute orang
outang, had quite a levee. This will be hia
lastw-ekin this City. Performances will be
given every evening this week and on Satur
day and Sunday only will matinees be given.
TWO CIRCUSES IN ONE.
The Great Forepaugh- Sells Com
bination to Arrive
Soon.
For Ten Days and Nights the Public
Will Have Plenty of Amuse
ment.
The amusement-loving public will soon
have a treat in the shape of the largest
circus that has ever reached this coast.
The huge tents of the Adam FÂ»repaugh
and Sells Brothers' consolidated shows
will be pitched in Central Park, on Mar
ket and Eighth streets, on September 3.
The show will continue for ten days only,
but during that time every novelty of tne
arena, the sawdust rine and in the zoolog
ical world will be presented.
The famous original Adam Forepaugh
herd of wild animals and the equally ex
pert one of Sells Brothers are included in
this rare assemblage of animal actors, and
appear simultaneously, illustrating in
many most surprising and entertaining
ways the methods of tbe different schools
in whicU they have been educated as sol
diers, dancers, clowns, boxers, musicians,
grotesques, wheelmen, high ballancers,
dudes, waiters, diners, mimics, come
dians, acrobats and multiversant artists.
Every 6pecies of every age and size is
represented, including elephants from
Africa, Asia, Ceylon, Borneo and Sumat
ra, and ranging from the huge monarch of
at least a century's growth to the dwarf
and baby. They also appear in the grand
double daily street parade, forming with
other nobie and savage creatures a re
markable exhibit in a most remarkable
pageant, w^ich servss as a stupendously
suggestive prelude to the finest perform
ance ever seen.
The only genuine Japanese circus is one
of the unique and astonishing features of
tbe united shows, and the aerial perform
ances include the only flying trapeze acts
done by ladies in full dress and long
skirts, and the funniest midair bar antics
ever seen.
The management has made every ar
rangement for the amusement of the chil
dren, who will be no doubt kept in an up
roar by the antics of the clowns. The
street parades, too, will form an interest
ing feature. Heretofore either show has
presented a public spectacle that attracted
old and young, but the combination of
the two has made possible the presentation
of the most attractive street pageant of
the world. __ _______^___
IN A GRIP OF IRON,
How a Bulldog's Characteristic
Tenacity Brought Him
to Grief.
Crowds Gather to Witness the Man
ner in Which Hs Jaws Were
Male to Relax
George Thackeray, of Twenty-second
street, near Fair Oaks, has a very sick dog.
A night or so ago John L. Williams and a
handsome Gordon setter were taking a
promenade, neither man nor dog thinking
of trouble. Suddenly Mr. Williams missed
his dog. Turning about, he saw the ani
mal with its face apparently gJued to Mr.
Thackeray's fence. He drew near to in
vestigate the situation when a low growl
admonished him to keep where he was.
Peeping discreetly over the fence he saw
tbat the Thackeray canine had his own by
the muzzle and would not let him go.
A ten-ioot pole was called into requi
sition, but wiih indifferent success, the
only effect of its use being a wild duet of
yelps, growls, whines ana frantic yells,
which soon filled the street with people.
Thackeray came forth to reprimand his
bulldog, but the brute hung on with a
grip compared to which that of a vise was
as the pressure of a bashful maiden's
band. Sticks, stones, hot water, bricks,
and coals were employed with no avail,
though the crowd cheered Itmily.
An obliging neighbor, seeing that other
energies were powerless, furnished a carV
ins knife, wherewith the bulldog was cut
and hacked in order to make him release
his hold. In the darkness Mr. Thackeray's
left wrist was severely cut; but the dog
held on. A desperate remedy was employed
at last, the bulldog's jaw being laid bare
by a df>ep, jagged cut. Faint with loss of
blood, the lusty warrior lay down, bis grip
relaxing only when bis bleeding body had
become inert. An officer of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal 3
offered to kill the mangled dog, but Mr.
Thackeray promised to have him cured,
as he might prove of use in case of inva
sion by some hostile power.
Mr. Williams' pet, though much bat
tered in the melee, is comparatively unin
jured. His facial beauty, to be sure, is
much impaired, but "in other respects he
is doing quite well."
AS ETtUOJt'S FATAL, MISSTEP.
Attempted to A tight From a Car That
Wat in Slotxon.
WINSTON, N. C., Aug. 17.â Captain J.
W. Goslen, editor of the Union Republi
can, the organ of the Republican party in
this State, met with a fatal accident this
afternoon. He was returning from the
Postoffice with his mail in the streetcar,
and attempting to step from the car be
fore it stopped was thrown violently on
the macadamized street. His head struck
a stone, which produced concussion of the
brain and caused his death. Captain Gos
len was 55 years old.

TJdJS SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, 1896.
BROWN'S ENEMIES
DOWN ON MORSE
The "Opposition" Making
Efforts to Rally Its
Forces.
COUNT OF PARTISANS.
Project to Install a Pastor With
out the Senior Deacon's
Consent.
PIQUANT PERSONAL TALK.
Difficulties Appear to Beset the Bud
ding Movement in Its Very
Inception.
What is known as the "opposition" fac
tion in the First Congregational Church is
meditating a move which is calculated to
force the other party to show its real
strength. It seems that according to Con
gregational polity a majority of the church
members may, independently of deacons,
trustees or standing committee, call a
pastor, and a majority of the church
society â which must not be confounded
with the church membership â may confirm
and install the pa-tor thus called. In
other words, Congregationalism recog
nizes as its tribunal of ultimate resort the
will of the majority, which may set aside,
the acts of any governing body connected
with the church organization.
In accordance with this principle the
opposition is secretly taking steps to secure
a majority of the church members and a
majority of the First Congregational So
ciety, call a pastor, have him installed
and confirmed in his appointment by the
society, and put an end to what it calls the
"Morse regime."
On the other hand the board of
deacons, of whom only two side with the
opposition, have the right by a majority
vote to supply the pulpit without consult
ing the church as a whole until a pastor
shall be regularly called. One or other of
these two things is about to happen very
soon. Deacon Morse and the three other
deacons who stood by the late pastor in
his difficulties are making every en
deavor to find a clergyman able to assume
the duties of a position so hedged about
with peculiar trials and pitfalls as the
pastorate of the First Congregational
Chnrch must be for years to come.
The opposition counts among its strong
est sympathizers the Rev. J. H. Warren,
Dr. J. T. McDonald, Deacon T. H. Hatch,
George T. Gaden and Meyer Strauss. Mrs.
Cooper is also regarded as one of the par
tisans of the opposition, although she re
frains from all public manifestation of
adhesion to either side.
AU the foregoing topics were weighed
and dwelt upon at length during yestei
day's gathering of the opposition leaders.
The meeting took place in the after
noon and was entirely executive in
character. All the members knew
nothing about it when questioned,
and, indeed, few besides the specially
invited ones were aware of the holding of
the meeting. From a trustworthy sonrce,
however, it was learned that the object of
the gathering was the preparation of a
paper to be signed by as many of the
church members as possible. The intent
of the framers of the proposed document
is to marshal the forces of the opposition,
to ascertain their number and estimate
their financial strength.
"We must do this first of all," pursued
The Call's informant, "in order to learn
just how we stand. At the meeting it was
seen tbat the plan had many drawbacks.
What could be done in case the trustees
refused to reopen the church? All recog
nized that Deacon Morse would have to be
got out of the road before we could do
anything; but how should he be induced
to give way to us? Anyway we are going
to learn what our numerical and financial
strength is. Then we can form plans as to
our future course of action.
"So much of the time at to-day's meet
ing was spent in discussing the difficulties
with which the situation is at present be
set that the paper for the proposed can
vass was not drawn up, but in ;i week or
two some steps will be taken. Mean
while we have many disappointments
and setbacks. Mrs. Cooper, though
she sympathizes with us, is unwill
ing to take any conspicuous part in
the work of reorganization. She
says she has lost many friends by reason
of her connection with the Brown case,
and although she has formed new and
strong attachments on the same account,
she seems to fear further publicity. All
she wants is to take her place as a simple
church member, retaining her Bible class,
and leaving the leadership in future bat
tles to others.
"Another distinguished member, who
has, so to speak, grown up with the First
Church and could be of the greatest assist
ance to our cause, refuses all part with us
save in a Bocial way. He considers the
church dead and buried, and attends the
services of the Gospel Mission. Other old
and valued members have done the same
or got into the way of attending other
churches. The old church has been
sadly rent and disrupted, but out of the
faithful remnant we hope to reorganize it.
The Brown meetings in the hall on Sutter
street had no claim to be called services of
the First Congregational Church, as they
were intended as the beginning of an in
dependent church, and would have grown
into one if Dr. Brown's health had not
broken down.
"We are willing to meet with the Sutter
street people and labor together for tne
reunion of the church if Deacon Morse
will resign his position of power in the
church society, but under his manage
ment we can do nothing. He and Dr.
Brown seemed to run the church
to suit themselves. The people
who call and pay a pastor should have
the first place in his consideration; but
Dr. Brown thought otherwise and preached
for the 'masses.' The masses came, and
soon our church was filled with riffraff of
the Overman-Tunnell-Davidson-Stockton
type, and then the troubles commenced.
Still the better element of the congrega
tion is with us, and if we can only get
them together we will carry our point."
The Church Manual, in article 3, section
I of the standing rules, provides that the
deacons shall see that the pulpit is sup
plied in the absence of a regular pastor,
and attend to the conduct of social re
ligious meetings. On page 41, under the
"Basis of Union," mention 13 made of "a
religious society, 1 ' designed to co
operate with the church, and organ
ized March 3, 1850, under the name
of the First Congregational Church So
ciety of San Francisco," ohurch and so
ciety being referred to as separate institu
tions, to act concurrently in certain cases,
whereof, the calling of a pastor is one..
Article V of the constitution gives the
trustees charge of the funds, real estate,
other property and business affairs of the
society. Tnere should be seven trustees,
but at present there are two vacancies in
the board. It is understood that the five
trn*tees now in office stand on neutral
ground as far as the present controversy
is concerned.

BUCKLEYITES CLOSE IN,
They Will Make Their Legis
lative Nominations Thurs
day Evening.
Final Arrangements Made for a
Primary and for an Early Muni
cipal Convention.
The Buckley general committee held a
meeting last night which packed the hall
at headquarters, at 24 Ellis street, ana
proceeded vigorously with the arrange
ments for the municipal convention of
this faction, to be held in B'naiÃ'rith
Hall on September 3.
The report of the executive committee
again changing to earlier ones the dates
for the convention and its preliminary
events was read by Secretary D. M. Gavi
igan and unanimously approved. The ad
vance in the dates, it was explained, was
made so that the municipal ticfcet could
be nominated and the test case which the
Buckleyitea will push vigorously as to
whether they or the Junta are entitled to
the party designation expedited.
It" was deoided that the district clubs
should meet next Thursday evening, the
20th inst., to nominate members of the
State Legislature and delegates to the mu
nicipal convention. The primaries will be
held on September 1 and the convention
two days later.
A discussion arose about the method of
making legislative nominations, and a
reference to the constitution' showed that
district clubs were required to make nomi
nations; that at the primary the candi
date receiving the highest number of votes
would be the Assembly or Senatorial dis
trict nominee, and that the district nomi
nations must be approved by the munici
pal convention.
It was announced that the district clubs
would meet on the evening of August 20
at the following places to nominate Legis
lative candidates:

TO PROTECT INSPECTORS
The Police Called to the Aid of
the Health Depart
ment.
Chinatown Investigation in a Syste
matic Manner Begins This
Morning.
The systematic Inspection of the Chinese
quarter by the Board of Health, with a
view to finding out just how many build
ings occupied by Chinese are in an un
sanitary condition or to be torn down,
will begin this morning under the super
vision of Inspectors Kenney and Fay,
who reported at the Health Office yester
day tbat everything was in readiness for
the arduous task that is before them.
It is expected that the Chinese, who are
alarmed at the action of the board in con
demning and ordering torn down a num
ber of their most dangerous iookeries,
will not submit tamely to the invasion of
their tottering tenements and under
ground den 3of filth and disease, and
preparations have been made to bring the
strong arm of the law between the inspec
tors and possiDle danger.
Chief Crowley has been appealed to
to aid the board in making the in
spection thorough and has detailed seven
stalwart policemen to accompany the in
spectors on their journey. The entire
force of inspectors and police will be di
vided into squads and every precaution
taken to see that no nook or cranny of the
quarter is left unexplored.
The work of each squad for each day
will be cut out for it beforehand, and the
results will be written out for tbe benefit
of the Health Officer each evening. Tne
canvass will be made from house to house,
the blocks on each street being taken in
regular succession, so that none may
escape the scrutiny of the inspectors.
Where buildings are deemed to be imme
diate menaces to the public health and
worthy of special attention the board will
make a personal investigation, and if
necessary order them vacated and torn
down. In ordinary cases the tenants will
be told to clean up at once on pain of ar
rest for maintaining nuisances.
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
FREE SALES TO
SAVE THE FRUIT,
Advocates of an Open Mar
k@t Say a Change Is
Needed.
LESSON OF THE GLUT.
Tons of Fruit Destroyed on the
Wharves for Want of
Purchasers.
AND YET IT CCULD BE SOLD.
With a FrÂ»e Market and Low Prices
Fruil Wou'd Be Bought for
Preserves.
The advocates of a free public market
for San Francisco are out again in behalf
of an institution through which the con
sumer of produce may purchase from the
grower direct. The matter has been sug
gested this time by the hopeless glut in
â the market and the consequent dumping
of cargoes of fruit, the very cream of val
ley orchards, into the bay.
For several days past the fruit wharves
have been so taxed with the immense
quantities of peaches, pears, etc., coming
in that there was absolutely no place left
yesterday where a small shipment might
be piled. Ordinary sales have had no ap
preciable effect in decreasing the bulk of
these great heaps of luscious fruit, that lie
ripening or rotting in the sunshine.
Rather as the days pass the fruit piles
seem to grow in height and general dimen
sions.
As there was no room at all last Satur
day tons of pears and peaches were hurled
into the water; they could not be sold at
standard market prices, as not everybody
could afford to buy. So rather than let
the price decline these large quantities
of delicious food were lost. The condi
tion, therefore, was a remarkable one;
while poor people, of necessity, had to go
without fruit, since they did not have the
money to pay for it, loads of excellent
pears and peaches were destroyed.
"With such a state of affairs in view the
men who would like to see a free public
market established say that no better illus
tration of the need of an open market
could be presented.
"The absence of a free public market,"
said W. H. Mills, "obstructs the consump
tion of articles of produce by high prices,
which never reach tne grower. There
certainly would be less of a glut if you
had a free market. This dumping of
fruit into the bay has a demoralizing
effect on the farmer. I believe that it
would not be possible if San Francisco had
a market where fruits and other country
products could be bought from the pro
ducers by the consumers.
"To the disgrace of San Francisco be It
said that she is 1000 years behind tno
methods of civilized cities in this respect
â that there is no one place in the whole
City where the consumer can buy his food
direct from the man who grows it.
"With an open market housekeepers
would be enabled to buy large stocks of
peaches and pears at a time like the pres
ent, when supplies' from the country are
glutting the market. The fruit thus
bought would be so cheap that it would be
within the reach of everybody and the
poor people have a chance to enjoy
it. The housekeeper would take ad
vantage of the reduced prices and secure
enough frnit to supply her house with
preserves for tho whole year. So you see
that while fruit would be crowding in
upon the market it could be bought in
large quantities and preserved. The can
neries have not sufficient capacity to buy
perishable fruit for immediate packing.
They can only handle a certain amount,
and consequently are powerless to relieve
a glut on the market. If^hey overstocked
themselves with fresh fruit much of it
might perish on tneir hands.
"There are various causes for the pres
ent glut. California cannot eat all its
fruit, and there is no money in the East
to buy our fruit this season. Fruit be
comes an article of luxury by the time it
reaches the Eastern consumei. The big
gest outrage perpetrated in the world is
the rate of commission exacted by Eastern
agents for selling California fruit. In Chi
cago 7 per cent is charged, and those
agents have no money at stake, no risks to
rnnâ if they sell your fruit they get 7 per
cent; if they don't, well you lose all.
"I am satisfied that a free public market
in San Francisco would maintain the
equilibrium, and with the exception of
some unusual conditions, such as a dull
ness in Eastern demand, things could be
made to regulate themselves very nicely
during the short while fruit is crowding
in from the orchards."
Harbor Commissioner Colnon said that
the Commissioners were at their wits' end
to know what to do with the fruit supply.
He said that he believed in an open mar
ket, wherein retailers could buy from tho
producers direct, but not a place where
housekeepers could get small comple
ments. On this plan he was convinced
that the situation would be relieved by an
open market.
BALTIC-NORTH SEA CANAL.
Found to Be of Great Strategic Value to
Germany.
BERLIN, Germany, Aug. 17.â The plan
in connection with the German naval
maneuvers to test toe strategic value of
the Baltic- North Sea canal has been car
ried out without a hitch. Thirty-nine
warships have traversed the canal in thirty
hours without an accident of any kind
happening. This performance, in view of
the adverse foreign comment upon the un
certainty of the canal, is regarded as a
fact that greatly enhances the use of the
waterway, showing, as it does, the rapidity
with which warships can pass from one
sea to the other. Emperor William is de
lighted with the result of the maneuvers
and is particularly pleased with tne suc
cessful passage of the warships.

LONDON, Eng., Aug. 17 â The Times
Berlin correspondent telegraphs that it is

seeking means to combat the monopoly of

possibly steps will be taken to facilitate
ttio importation of Galician petroleum,
and that an attempt will be made to it**.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. Y.,Aug. 17.â During the early
trading at the stock exchange to-day the market
was feverish and irregular owing to lower cables
from London, and a belief that money rates would
work higher in the near future. An advance In
money rates was chiefly looked for because of the
demand for funds in the interior, incident to this
season of the year and to the low state of bank re
serves. London firms were also moderate sellers
in the early dealings, and this added to the fever
ish ness.
Sugar was bought on a large scale by brokers
gaid to be acting for a leading bear, and the stock
was advanced from 1023/1 to 105%. A week ago
to-day the stock brought 95.
The announcement that refined sugar had been
rcauccd 1/8 >Â° 3 l-16c per pound had no influence
on the stuck. The strength of sugar imparted a
firm tone to the general list, and late in the day,
when ca 1 loans, instead of advancing, fell to 2%
per cent and sterling exchange displayed weak
ness, the market tor stocks showed positive
strencth. some of the- late buying was doe to the
belief that a meeting of the sound money Demo
crats to-morrow nitrht will be a great success. The
reactionary tendency in the silver market also had
a good effect The rise in the active stocks was
tqual to %(Si2 per cent, Sugar, Chicago Gas and the
Grangers leading.
Mannattan was Inclined to weakness, se'ling at
74i/2<ai77i4. closing at 76, a loss of 1 per cent on
the day. The slock was influenced by the unfa
vorab.e report for the June quarter, which showed
a deficit after payment of dividends of 886.400.
For the year the earnings were less than 4 per
. tent on the stock. In the final transactions specu
lation was quiet and firm, except for Manhattan,
whicn is a shade lower. Net changes show gains

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO,' ItT-. Aug. 17 â The wheat market
began the week in rather an unobtrusive manner,
the trade being . quite lifeless at times during the
session and the active moments failing short of
real live animation. The crowd was bearish at the
opening this morning on an estimate that the
world's shipments would aggregate 6,509,000
bushels and on an excited early free movement of
spring wheat, the present arrivals tending to con
firm that belief. A fractional recovery took place
in about an hour after the opening on talk of frost,
but the sentiment was not possessed of sufficient
merit to sustain prices for long and they again re
ceded. Receipts were 220 cars at Chicago, and
125,310 bushels were tiik n from store. The
Northwest had 307 cars, against 407 last, Monday
and 348 a year ago. â¢ .
'1 he visible supply decreased 658,000 bushels
and the amount on ocean passage 1,040,000 bush
els. After the posting of the visible supply figures
the market evinced greater weakness, inside quo
tations being then established. Export clearances
amounted to 148.605 bushels. Closing . Berlin ca
bles were Vi@% marks higher. Antwerp was un
changed. Pails had a holiday. The English visi
ble supply increased 634,000 bushels. On a re
iteration of the first scare in , the extreme North
west prices rallied at the close. Septimber wheat
ooenedfrom 543,4 c. to 64. r > s i\ sold between 6i@
50' .(Cain! 54c, cosing at 54% c bid, %c under Sat
urday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow -.48 cars.
CORNâ The amount of corn inspected from
store since Saturday, 1,266,857 bushels, gave rise
to considerable comment and was a powerful aid
to prices to-day. Although sympathizing with
wheat on the start there . was efficacy enough in
the large output to overcome that influence later.
The receipts, 841 cars, were 191 cars more than
expected. The visible supply Increased 1,562,000
bushels, the amount on ocean passage 1,200,000
bushels. Liverpool cables were quiet and steady.
The visible and ocean passage increase were
too much for holders and prices declined on
free selling later. Export clearances were 44,108
bushels. The close was firmer. May corn opened
from 2634@26%c, sold between 27@26%c, closing
at 2d%r, a shade under Saturday. Estimated re
ceipts 1 or to-morrow, 378 cars
OATS â Were dependent upon the other grains,
rising and falling in price with them. The busi
ness was mainly of a local sort and not of much
interest even in that way. Receipts were 135
cars, and 63,000 bushels were taken from store,
The visible supply increased 334,000 bushels.
May oats closed %c higher than Saturday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow, 395 cars.

PROVISIONSâ Advanced on the report that
hogs were, up sÂ£sloc, notwithstanding a heavier
run than expected. Traders . were not especially
anxious to do business, however, the financial dis
turbance being advanced as the reason for their
apathy. January pork closed 12% c higher, Janu

â  ' The wharves and sidewalks ' are blocked with

opened Sunday In order to work off ? Saturday's ac
cumulation and sold Peaches at 10c * basket, but
did not reduce stocks much. Yesterday was as
bad and we are obliged to omit quotations for Fruit
m bulk, as the canners are still crowded with con
tract Fruit and cannot relieve i the ' market lof its
fresh stock. Ihe cause of the glut is the dullness
in trade everywhere 'which \ cuts ; down shipments
to the East and elsewhere and throws an extra
quantity on this I market. Grapes alone 1 sell well,
being in demand with light stocks. â

FOR FEW OFFICES
The Call for County Con
vention Primaries Will
Soon Be Issued.
TWO JUDGES TO RETIRE
Six Assemb ymen and One Sen
ator Are to Bb Elected
This Fall.
AND THREE NEW SUPERVISOES
Already Pians Are Being Made and
Miny Candidates Have Announced
Their Ambitions.
Oaklasd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 17. f
The Republican County Central Com
mittee will meet Wednesday to canvass
the returns of the recent primary and to
hx a date for the meeting at which a call
will be issued for the primary for the
county convention. There will be no con
flict of authority over the call, as every
thing will be exclusively in the power of
the County Committee, and it will name
the polling places and election officers
without consulting any outside body.
The County Committee rooms were de
serted to-day. The odor of political cigars
filled the air; from numerous spittoons
microbes innumerable floated upward; in
a corner was a broker, ballot-box, and
everything looked as though the place had
been deserted for months. There was
nothing to indicate that for some weeks
tbe quarters have been crowded with
excitable politicians, who laid plans and
counter-plans with as much earnestness as
though a nation were at stake.
There are not many offices to be filled,
but there are many people anxious to fill
them. The list of plums is as follows:
Three Supervisors.
Seven Assemblymen.
One Senator.
Two Superior Judges.
The retiring Supervisors are Pelouze,
Johnston and Bailey. The men who think
they can attend to Mr. Pelouze's district
better than he has done are: W. W.
Knickerbocker, ex-Committeeman Mitch
ell, J. league, W. J. Scbmidt and Mr.
Moran. This contest will be a hard one, as
Pelouze is anxious to hold his job, and his
anti-railroad record regarding the recent
assessment embroglio will be remembered.
This district embraces the railroad quar
ters in the First Ward. Nobody will have
a walk over, forif Pelouze gets the Repub
lican nomination Friend will probably run
independent.
J. E. Johnston is not averse to serving
the county another term, but he has a
Mrong competitor in W. H. Friend, the
leading spirit in the new Congressional
committee and who was a hard worker for
Hiilborn, and who will receive much sup
port. W, C. Mason and ex-Supervisor D.
O. Brown are also in the fight to succeed
Johnston, so a lively primary in that dis
tiict is assured. The third Supervisor to
be retired is Bailey of Llvermore. The
country district has so long been consid
ered his bailiwick that any one who should
try to oust Bailey would be considered
foolhardy a lew months ago. But now
things have chanted and H. Croweil of
Irvington and T. \V. Harris of Pleasanton
and several ot hers are anxious to break the
routine and give Mr. Bailey a chance to
re^t. Considerable opposition to Bailey
has recently been shown among the farm
ers of Murray and Washington townships
and Bailey will have to fight hard to win.
In the Forty-ninth Assembly Diotrict
some of the wou'd-be legislators already
have their cards out. John Mott, W. S.
Jones, Jim Rock, one-armed Charlie Hall
and Taylor of Berkeley are candidates,
and "Brocky Dan" Mullins would also
line to go to Sacramento. The remaining
five districts are quiet as yet, although H.
11. North may try to succeed himself.
Senator Eli Denison and J. L. Baird
hold over, and a successor to Guy C. Earl
is to be elected. So far it looks as if Fred
S. Stratton will receive the nomination.
Judge Greene would like to succeed him
self on the Superior bench, and Judge
Frick will retire. Sam P. Hall, W. Lair
Hill, Georse \V. Langan of Livermore and
H. B. M. Miller would each iike to fill one
o f the vacancies, with others yet to hear
from. There will certainly be tyro tickets
in each district at the county primary,
and tne lines will be much the same as at
Saturday's contest.
THE SHOPS ARE SAFE.
Strong Official Denials that tbe Southern
Pacific Will Move Them From
Oakland.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 17.â The officials
of the Southern Pacilic Company are
very strong and explicit in their denials
that their shops in ihis city are to be re
moved. These denials are brought out by
the publication, in a San Francisco morn
ing daily, of an interview with Stephen
G. Gage regarding tbe situation.
These officials say such an idea would
be preposieroua because of many reasons.
In the first place it would cost a vast
amount to make any change. Again there
is no site in San Francisco without lilling
the Mission fiats, winch itself would cost
a vast sum. Furthermore it would be
placing the shops on wheels to be carted
Jrom town to town when this or that
town was willing to raise the money and
go where the shops were and defeat the
railroad candidates or measures.
BELL HELD FOR TRIAL.

OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 17.â Charles J.
Bell was held for trial this morning by

Will Josh the Freshmen. â 
BERKELEY. Cal.. Aug. 17.â The soph
omores decided at their meeting this af
ternoon to "jolly the freshies" at their
every opportunity, to sing "Freshle in the
High Chair" and to give the "00" men
the bitter medicine customarily poured
out for freshmen by their natural enemies
â the sophomores. The rear steps of
North Hall will be the central point of at
tack upon the "freshies," and from it will
be sung songs and recited doggerel in de
rision of the "00" men.
Some of the new men heard of the reso
lutions of the "sophies," and immediately
after the adjournment of the '99's class
meeting attacked them on the campus,
and the (wo factions joined in a short and
bloodless rush with even honors. Thus
the first "go" between the '99 and the
"00" men was recorded.

Board of Equalization.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 17.â The Board
of Equalization held its last meeting this

The Suffragists.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 17.â The parlors
of Mrs. James A. Waymire were not large !
enough to hold the assemblage of ladies |
and gentlemen who attended this evening I
to hear Raymond Robbins address them '
on the subject of political equality. He
said:
"In watching the development of the !
principle of equality we see that the Na- 1
tion cannot endure half slave half free. '
Is there a single argument heard in the
rostrum to-day that was not used forty
years ago when chattel slavery was up
held ? I expect you all to do your duty in j
this campaign, to battle, defend and argue
until the 3d of November, and Dury the
lie in the ballot-box forever that woman is
not equal and would not be true to her
duty as a citizen. We have monometal
lism and bimetallism, high tariff and low
tariff, yet we have with us a corruption
that is eating out the vitals of our civic
life. There is only one force which will
cleanse this putrifying sore in our life, and
that is woman 1 8 vote."
Miss Winifred Harper then rpad an In
teresting paper. Among other things she !
pointed out that the same arguments
against woman suffrage were used twenty
five years ago against the higher educa
tion of women. If women possess the
womanly instinct, she said, suffrage will
only develop and intensify, not destroy it.

PECULIAR INDORSEMENT
Colonel Suter Holds the Comple
tion of the Tidal Canal to
Be Unnecessary.
The Sewage Problem Can Easily Ba
Solved by Oakland ard Alameda
Reconstructing Sewers.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 17âThe City
Clerk received a letter this afternoon from
A. Mackenzie, acting chief engineer of
the United States, in answer to one sent
by the direction of the Board of Trustees
to President Cleveland, urging the com
pletion of the Tidal Canal with as little
delay as possible.
The city's letter was sent to Colonel
Suter for his opinion on the matter, and
Mr. Mackenzie has sent a copy of Colonel
Suter's indorsement in his reply.
The following is a copy of the same:
San Francisco, Cal., July 17, 1896.
The nuisance herein complained of is caused
by the discharge into the harbor of Oakland,
Cal., of the public and private sewers of the
adjacent towns. The harbor in question is
dredged out at its Inner end to form a tidal
basin of considerable area, but small depth.
Beyond this a canal designed to connect the
harbor with San Leandro Bay has been partly
excavated at both ends, leaving an uncom
pleted portion in the middle. The end nearest
Oakland was dredged through to the tidal
basin some two years ago, at the earnest solici
tation of the town of Alameda, which made
complaint against the stagnant water in the
excavation. The result of this has been that
the foul matter from the sewers Is driven by
the tides and the prevailing westerly winds
not only to the upper end of the harbor but
into the unfinished canal and remains there.
All trouble would be obviated if the inhabi
tants of theso towns would so modify their
sewer systemsas not to discharge into Oakland
harbor. The remedy which they propose is to
have the United States complete the canal to
San Leandro Bay and divert the tidal flow
from that bay out through Oakland harbor.
This part of the original project for tue im
provement of Oakland harbor, made In 1874,
was bused on imperfect information and is
now thought to be unnecessary. The esti
mated cost of its completion is $512,000, and
the only benefit likely to result is the possible
flushing of the cesspool which has been made
out of Oakland harbor. The money actually
appropriated to complete tho work or imDrove
ment is all needed for work on the harbor
proper, and the carrying out of the canal
project would absorb nearly the whole sum
and leave the really important work, for which
the appropriation is supposed to have been
made, in a half-finished condition.
Charles R. Scter,
Colonel of Engineers. U. S. A.
B. F. Lamborn, in speaking of Colonel
Suter's opinion, said: "I wonder if the
colonel has any idea that Colonel Men
dell in his term of office never left any
memorandum behind him that the origi
nal plan of 1874 was considered unneces
sary. The trail of the octopus is between
the lines. Colonel Suter owns that the
canal and harbor is a cesspool, and seeing
that the sewer system of this city and
Dart of Oakland was formulated and car
ried out on the distinct belief that the
Federal authorities were going to carry
out the work on the lines laid down.it is
nothing less than unmitigated gall to ask
these cities to now go to work and recon
struct their sewer systems. Colonel Suter
will find before he is through with it that
his conclusions are based on imperfect in
formation."

TAKEN FOR A
PRIMARY STUFFER
One of Twin Brothers Was
Threatened With
Arrest.
MISTAKE OF IDENTITY.
H. J. Waters Is Taken for a
Duplicate of His Brother
Albert.
ONE OF MANY MISTAKES.
It Was Supposed the Same Man Was
Trying to Get on the Great
Register Twice.
Oakland Office San Feancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 17. j
All sorts of stories are being told about
the recent primaries, but the best to date
is that of the twins who did not get on the
register because they were so much alike.
Everybody in Alameda County knows
the Water* twins. They are two complete
editions of the same thing.
Both have been Christian Endeavor
presidents and delegates, and very few
people except their mother and their
tiancees can tell them apart. When one
was running for County Clerk on the
Prohibition ticket he received twice as
many votes as were intended for him be
cause the friends of both voted for the
candidate, judging from the picture on
the campaign-card that both were one.
In due time the twins went to the clerk's
office to register, but they did not go to
gether. The description of the one that
registered first was: "Height, six feet;
complexion, light; eyes, blue; hair,
brown; residence, 869 Jackson; business,
reporter."
In due time the other man came along
and bis description read: "Height, six
feet; complexion, light; eyes, blue; hair,
brown; residence, 869 Jackson; business,
r eporter." When the second one regis
tered and his affidavit was filed it was evi
dently regarded as a duplicate and was
taken out of the file.
Thus it came about that at the primary
only one could vote, and when the other
went to the polls he was threatened with
arrest for being a repeater. The affair
created quite a little sensation, as the
Waters are church members and Odd Fel
lows in good standing, and such people
are not supposed to be of the kind that
stuff prmiary ballot-boxes.
"I can only explain it on the theory
I that the typewriters who wrote that pre
cinct thought a duplicate had been made,"
said County Clerk Jordan to-day. "Both
gentlemen will be able to vote, as the
duplicates will all be compared carefully
before any are discarded. When they
called here separately I thought it was
I the same man trying to get on the register
j twice."
All kinds of jokes have been played on
the twins on account of their absolute
likeness, and at their Sunday-school class
the scholars never knew whicu one was
taking an afternoon nap. They work on
an afternoon paper, but only one gets a
salary, as only one is employed. When
one substitutes himself for the other the
editor is no wiser, as they both write the
same hand and think in the same strain.
Although locally both are Prohibition
ists, they will both vote the McKinley
j ticket. Their initials are H. J. and A. R.,
I ana they have such a peculiar way of
j si.ning their names that they look very
much alike. They both wear glasses.
McKinley and "C. E." buttons, and when

SKYLARKING
AT DEL MONTE,
An Incident in Funmaking
That Became Se
rious.
DEPARTURE OF GUESTS
A Magnate's Repose Disturbed
by Noisy Mischief-
Makers.
COMPLAINT TO THE MANAGER
A Bowling-Alley Ball Bounds Against
the Door of Charles Alex
ander.
There was skylarking at Del Monte last
Friday night. The high living at the
hotel, the ozone from Monterey Bay and
the bounding spirits of several young
ladies and gentlemen promoted the inno
cent diversion, or the departure from the
conventional rules of deportment bo long
respected at this swell resort.
The fun began by youngsters using big
trays for | sliding downstairs and the mer
riment was prolonged until some of the
"old folks" went to bed.
In the larfc/a young lady who was pur
sued in the hallway turned playfully on
her pursuer, and picking up a shoe that
bad been left in the hall to be polished
cast it at the young man who was pursu
ing her. Bang went the shoe against the
door of a venerable old man who had
sought Del Monte for repose. Knowing
that his own hopeful youngster was in the
party of skylarkers he sallied forth
and brought that young man into his
room. He took the opportunity also to
give the others a piece of his mind, and re
tired again for rest.
The prank players were somewhat taken
back by this demonstration on the part of
tbe seekers after repose, so to get even
they went over to the clubrooms and got
one of the big balls used in the tenpin
bowling alley. They went up in Ihe hall
way of the hotel to roll the ball against
the old man's door, but made a mistake in
the room and sent the ball bang up
against the door of another guest. Un
fortunately for the skylarkers, it turned
out that the other guest was Charles
Alexander of New York. He is not the
proprietor of tbe hotel, but has such rela
tions with the corporation that owns the
caravansary that the landlord is bound to
respect his wishes. Mr. Alexander was
getting that repose which nature demands
after one has made the journey across the
continent from New York to San Fran
cisco in the month of August, when the
ball struck. Then he came forth in his
wrath and his pajamas. The youngsters
thought he was as tall as Alexander of
historic renown.
Accounts differ as to what Alexander
did do or did say. One version is that he
roared and uttered imprecations. Another
version is that he sent quietly for the man
ager and demanded that the frolicsome
youngsters be expelled instantly from the
hotel.
Anyway, quiet for tbe night was re
stored ana the incident was supposed to
be closed, but on the following morning
the manager was pressed to take extreme
measures and inform some of the young
men of the party that their departure
would oblige the management. When
things reached that pass the friends of the
skylarking young people thought that too
much was being made of the incident,
and so they resolved to go if the young
men went.
The result was an exodus of quite a
number of liberal patrons of the hotel.
They regarded their position in society
quite as high as that occupied by the of
fended party, and so resolved to stand by
their Iriends. The first train yesterday
from D^el Monte Drought to the City quite
a number of guests belonging to the best
known families of local society.
THE PIONEERS' OUTING.
They Will Own Â£1 Campo and the
Ferry-Boat Lkiah for a
Day.
The Society of California Pioneers have
secured the exclusive use of El Campo for
its celebration on September 9, also the
ferry-boat Ufciah. Transportation will be
furnished to members and their families
free. The steamer will leave the wharf at
9:30 a. m., and before proceeding to the
picnic grounds will make a run down the
bay, giving the excursionists a chance to
look at the battle-ship Oreeon and other
warships in the harbor.
At El Campo the literary exercises will
be held. For the second time in the his
tory of the organization of Pioneers a non
member will deliver the oration. Last
year General W. H. L. Barnes was chosen.
This time Hon. Samuel M. Shortridge has
been invited to tiie post and has given his
assent. Dr. C. D. Cleveland is the poet
of the occasion.

TWO STRONG MEN.
Ona Endured Excruciating; Pain and
the Other Performed Wonders
for His Belief.
The passengers on an evening ferry
boat to tins City last night crowded
around two men, one prostrate and the
other apparentlv*in charge of him.
It seemed that the man on his back was
Antonio Lucchere, an employe in the
machine-room of the river steamer Rona,
who met with an accident wnereby the
fleshy part of his leg from the kneG to the
antic had been torn completely away.
The accident happened about twelve miles
above Knights Landing.
The man was suffering excruciating pain
and the mate of the Rona undertook to
relieve him. The nearest available succor
was at Kniehts Landing, twelve miles
away, and thither the plucky mate rowed
Lucchere in a small skiff. At Knights
Landing the wound was rudely dressed
and then the two set out for this City,
where every care will be given the
wounded man.
TO LICENSE RACETRACKS.
Pools Can Be Sold in the Inclos
ures of Racing Places in
Alameda County.
New Ordinance Passed by the Super
visors Regulating Racetracks
and Poolrooms.
Oaklanp Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aue. 18. J
An ordinance permitting pool-selling on
racetracks was passed by the Supervisors
to-day. Its title explains its purpose. It
reads:
An ordinance licensing racetracks in the
county of Alameda and prohibiting all per
sons from engaging In and selling pools or
making bets or wagers or making books or
book-making, or acting as the agent or servant
or commissioner of another in making any
bet or wager, upon or concerning horseraces
or contests of skill or speed or power of en
durance of or between horses, in tne limits of
the county of Alameda, except within the en
closure of racetracks in said county, where
horseraces are being actually conducted;
also prohibiting in all places in the
county, other than within inclosure of
race tracks in said county of Alameaa
where horseraces are being actually con
ducted, the selling of pools and the making of
books, bets or wagers on any contest of skill,
speed or power of endurance between horses,
or upon any uncertain contingency wherein
money or any representation of money or
other'articles of value are staked, pledged or
deposited or agreed to be; and also prohibit

apartment, place, ground or lot or premises
ior the purposes prohibited by this ordinance,
except within the inclosure of racetracks.
Thomas Williams of the California
Jt>ckey Club addressed the board.
"There is no question," he said, "as to
the value of legitimate horseracing in
this country. The policy of the California
JocKey Club has been to benefit the local
ity in which it is located'as much as possi
ble, and upon its advent la Oakland it will
surely be of material value to commercial
interests.
"When the races come here they will
bring people and money. We have bought
all our lumber and all the materials
needed in Oakland, and as well laborers,
mechanics and other workmen have been
engaged from this county."
The ordinance was ordered to be printed
for ten days, at the end of which time it
will become a law. Supervisor Talcott
voted against it.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, AUGUST 18, 1896.
BOTH GAZED AT
THE WIDE OCEAN
But They Regarded It in
Such a Very Different
Light.
FOSTER AND FERGUSON
An Old Story to One and Some
thing Entirely New to
the Other.
A WEALTHY MINER ABASHED.
Had Never Ridden in a Streetcar Nor
Catered to an Elevator Boy
Until Lately.
Two odd characters stood on a project
ing point yesterday at the Cliff House.
No two men could have had ideas more
in contrast.
There was E. J. Foster, who calmly
looked out on the broad expanse before
G. S. Ferguson, the Wealthy Arizona Miner Who Had Never Gazed Upon
the Ocean.
him, spat out the tip oi a cigar he had just
bitten off and <â  uggested that it would be
well to "jog in town before the crowd got
off the streets."
With Foster was G. S. Ferguson, the
mining man from Arizona.
Old - timers will remember Foster.
Twenty-five years ago â yes, even farther
back than that â Foster was the major
domo at the Cliff House. That resort was
not the imposing edifice it is to-day, but
the one-story old shanty toward which
everybody drove passing through toll
eates on the old "Cliff House road," where
the Geary-street cars now run. It took
hours to get there and a longer time still
to tear one's self away. Those were the
days when William Ralston, Johnny Skae,
Jack Hill, Jack Waitles and others
thought nothing of awakening Foster to
have him judee their weight- casting con
tests, full champagne bottles being the
weights and the seal rocks the mark.
Foster made fortunes over and over
again in those days, religiously bringing
them back to his broker friends in the
Stock Exchange.
Eventually Foster gave up the place to
Wilkin*, the present lessee, and wandered
out into rhe world with a surfeit of the
beautiful ocean view and the seal rocks.
Not so with his companion, G. S. Fergu
son, a young man of 27 summers, born
and raised in Phoenix, Ariz., and who had
never seen anything outside of the terri
tory.
He had never before beheld the grandeur
of an ocean. To him the white sails of
ships far out on the deep were but things
he had read of in books. The mighty roar
of the breakers upon the rocks at" his feet
was but a fit accompaniment to the over
whelming sensation that overcame him.
With his mouth wide open, rivaling the
expanse of his eyes, he stood there en
tranced, almost frightened, but very
hacpy.
"Come off, Ferguson," exclaimed Foster,
whose first remark bad passed unheaded
by the Arizona man. "Get out of your
trance and let's get home."
Young Ferguson had never seen the
ocean ; streetcars were strange to him,
and he had never ridden in an elevator,
excepting to take him into the mines,
until he reached this City a few days ago.
He is the proprietor, with his father and
brother, of the Hermit gold mine, near
PreÂ«cott. Some days ago he disposed of
the Jersey Lily mine, located twelve miles
from Prescott, to an English syndicate for
a most flattering sum. He had been work
ing in the development of the mine for
two years, having the ore milled by other
people. Even in this he succeeded in
getting out some $30,000.
"People hardly appreciate what a great
mining country Arizona is," he said.
"The English, however, are taking ad
vantage of the situation, and they are
pouring money into our Territory. They
are taking up old claims that have been
worked from the surface only and have
been allowed to remain idle. They have
learned that it is deep mining that pays
best.
"See what was done with the Jerome
mines or the United Verde. Three times
have they been aold and bought, and now
W. A. Clark of Montana has refused an
offer for them of $10,000,000."
Mr. Ferguson is here at the Grand Ho
tel on a month's pleasure trip. He will
leave in a few days to visit Los Angeles.
THAT OBNOXIOUS CAMP.
Contractor Buckman Denies That He
Is Defying the Board of
Health.
Contractor A. E. Buckman, the proprie
tor of a grading camp near the junction
of Scott and Waller streets, which has
been complained of dv the Hospital Lot
Improvement Club, has addressed a
lengthy communication to the Board of
Health.
He states that he has taken every care
of the sanitary condition of his camp, and
that the residents in the neighborhood
have no just cause for complaint. He
emphatically denies that he defied the
Board of Health, but on the contrary has
asked that body to inspect his place and
make its wishes known regarding improve
ments or changes if any are thought nec
essary.
Contractor Buckman also states that
the Hospital Lot Improvement Club never
asked him to attend their meetings and
never made known their objection to any
feature of his camp until they took a
"snap judgment" on him. Regardinc the
cleanliness and healthfulness of the carop
he says that all the sinks and drain pipes
of the kitchen and stables connect with
the sewer and no water is permitted to
flow off the lot. The quarters of the men
and horses are kept clean, and disinfect
ants are used in ail the apartments.
Regarding the diphtheria reported only
two cases have ever appeared among the
several thousand laborers who have come
and gone there. The writer expresses
himself as perfectly willing to obey the
orders of the Board of Health relative to
placing the camp in a satisfactory sani
tary condition, but will resist by lawful
means any attempt to remove or tear
down his improvements.
SADIE MARTINOT IS HERE
Had Her Horoscope Read and
Feels Sure of a Pleasant
Future.
Intends to Buy a Little Farm in
Southern California as a Home
in Old Age.
Sadie Martinot, with other members of
"The Gay Parisians," arrived here Sun
aay afternoon direct from Chicago and
took apartments at the Baldwin, where
she will remain during the two weeks'
theatrical engagement in this City.
"Do you know," she said yesterday
evening, as she sat in the midst of some of
her stage dresses that had just been un
packed and spread over all tbe available
chairs and other furniture in the room, "I
had my horoscope read a little while ago
in Boston.
"Such strange things, and all so pleasant
that I like to believe them ! I really tl.ink
this trip was forecast. First, I was to have
come out here with Nat Goodwin and then
J, came pretty near malting a contract with
Mr. Friedlander, and now I am here with
Mr. Frohman. Where I may go next of
cour-e I don't know, as I am in the Hands
of my manager. But, oh! I should love to
stay here longer, for I do so Jike San Fran
cisco, not alone in a theatrical way;
I like it because it is so cosmopolitan,
and because its immediate surroundings
are so picturesque. 1 really experience a
poetical feeling when I look over the bay
and out from the cliff ana watch the sun
set as though it tumbled right off the edge
of the earth, as though there were no
Japan or China somewhere Deyond that
ocean. I often feel that California, with
all its great products, its big trees and its
big fruits, will some day produce a piant
race of men, giants in intellect as well as
in physique.
"I am goinc this time to buy my mother
a nice little home in California â a little
country placeâ where, you know, I myself
can come in my old age; somewhere in
Southern California, I fancy, for that is so

His Ankle Broken.
Herman Zweb, butcher, living at 117 Julian
avenue, says he was in a saloon on the south
side of Clay street, near Montgomery, last
night, when the saloon-keeper assaulted him,
throwing him to the floor two or three times
and then pitching him into the street. Zweb's
left aukle was broken and he was taken to the

three children.
MATE McCALLUM
FELL TO DEATH,
Was Drowned Off Broad
way Wharf at His
Vessel's Side.
HIS BODY UNRECOVERED
Believed He Was Rendered Un
conscious Before He Struck
the Water.
A FAITHFUL AND POPULAR MAN
In the Employ of the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company Since His
Boyhood.
Charles McCallum, chief officer of the
steamer Gypsy, while boarding that vessel
at the foot of Broadway at about 8:30 p. m.
yesterday fell from the gangplank and was
drowned.
McCallum was formerly first mate of the
steamer Pomona, which plies between
here and Eureka, and was one of the most
popular men in the employ of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company among his
associates and the people who traveled on
his vessel.
As he was going aboard nis vessel for the
night he lost his balance on the gangplank,
between the wharf and the ship's side, fell
and struck the fender at the vessel's side
and disappeared. The alarm was at once
given by those who witnessed the occur
rence and prompt efforts were made to
rescue the unfortunate man. Boats were
cast loose, but no sign of the mate was
discernable. Grappling irons were then
brought into requisition and though the
tide was at the dead flood at the time of
the accident several hours' work in the
attempt to recover the body proved
fruitless.
It is believed that when McCallum
struck the fender he was rendered uncon
scious, as he was a good swimmer and
would have been able to keep afloat until
succor came had he retained his faculties.
A further search for the body will be made
to-day.
Deceased was one of the best known men
along the coast, and during his long and
faithful service had endeared himself to
every one with whom he came in contact.
One of the few men with whom he could
not atree was the captain of the Pomona.
He was first mate of that steamer
until about six months ago, when he was
forced to make a chance owing to a mis
understanding with her captain. He then
entered, upon the duties of the position he
held at the time he lost his life. When it
became known that he had left the Po
mona many of the prominent residents of
Eureka and the regular patrons of tbe
boat sent a petition to the .Pacific Coast
Steamship Company requesting that he
be reinstated on the Pomona, but this was
found to be inexpedient.
Mr. McCallum was about 48 years of age
and was unmarried. He entered the em
ploy of the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany when but a boy and had been in its
employ ever since. He was considered
one of the most efficient and faithful of
ficers.
CAPT. WHITE'S ANSWER.
Insists That He Was in the Bight In
the San Bafael- Tiburon
Controversy.
Captain White of the steamer Tiburon
considers that he has been unfairly cen
sured in the recent examination of the
San Rafael-Tiburon case by the Inspectors
of Hulls and Boilers. In presenting his
side of the matter he writes:
"I have been captain on all kinds of
steamers in this bay for twenty-eight
years. I have never cost my owners a dol
lar for damage, and this was my first ex
perience before a Board of Inspectors."
He then goes on to explain the position
of the two steamers, and asserts that the
only maneuverintr he resorted to was the
stopping of his boat in order to allow the
San Rafael to pass, and that he had no
part in the filing of any complaint.
A quotation from the Sausalito News
and his answer follow:
Why did not Captain White flic â¢â¦complaint
with the local inspectors, as it was his duty to do
so, if the San Rafael had put her helm to starboard
to cross his bow without giving tne proper signal T
To this complaint I will say that I did not
know that the passengers held an indignation
meeting or that there was any complaint
going to be filed until the day after it was tiled.
Then Inspector of Boilers W. 8. Phillips told
me on his way home to Belvedere that our pas
sengers hart tiled a complaint against Captain
Tribble. The next morning I went to Captains
Talbot and Phillips, Inspectors of Hulls and
Boilers, and stated that, in my opinion, there
was no ground for a complaint, as there was
no damage done nor any likelihood of a col
lision. Captain Talbot stated that as the com
plaint had already been filed he would
near two or three witnesses on each side, and
if in his opinion there was not sufficient
cnuse ho would throw out the complaint.
In answer to "Why did you not make a com
plaint?" I will state that I didn't think there
was sufficient cause for a complaint. I failed
to notify the complainants of their error, and
so precipitated the trouble that has been un
necessarily brought about by this trial.
He did not do so, but seemed to prefer the
piosecution of Tribble in the examination of the
case, in which he acted an prosecuting attorney
anil sadly failed to bring out a single fact aavanta^
geous 10 the prosecution.
In answer I would state I have committed
no error and have no apology ;o make. I
didn't bring on this trial, and had I not been
summoned by Mr. Berminehaml should never
have put my loot in the office. 1 am accused
of acting as pr; securing attorney. I distinctly
stated to the court that I was only a witness.
There was only one point argued, and that I
did not contradict, namely, "Did the Ban
Rafael change her course?" My answer in my
testimony was, ' 'I don't know.'"
During the trial there seemed to me to be
only one point in controversy. Did the San
Rafael change her course? The complaint filed
by the passengers of the steamer Tiburon
charged Captain Tribble with changing his
course. That is the only point, I supposed,
they cared to bring out, as there Is no other
mentioned in the decision of the court. I
would state that the passengers filed the com
plaint, and those who testified on the Tiburon's
side, such as Mr. Gerstle, Lieutenant Hasson,
W. C. Morrow, Mr. Sherwood, Mr. Langrehr,
who is a civil engineer, and many others who
wished to testify if they nad been called on,
were standing on the forward deck of the
Tiburon, while going along the City front, and
looking ahead. Tney were thus in a better
position to-judge how the Tiburon was head
ing than the people on the stern of the San
Rafael while she was crossing our bow and
watching tbe wake of the San Rafael to see
that she did not change her course. All of our
passengers testified that the Tiburon was from
150 to 300 feet from the dock ana ahead of the
San Rafael, and their testimony, in my judg
ment, has just as much weight as that of those
who were in a less favorable position to judge.
Borne of them have traveled on the boat for
years.
In support of his side of the case Cap
tain White quotes the testimony of some
of tbe witnesses and the "rules of the
road," and concludes:
This is my side oi the etory, which I am coo j
fldent the passengers on my boat will testify
to. I would state that I have not spoken to
one of the passengers who filed the complaint
before it was filed, nor since it was decided.
White has always been known as a care
ful master, and a better handled ferry
boat than the Tiburon is not to be found
on the bay of San Francisco.

DO NOT WANT WHALES,
The Carnival People Decide Not
to Indorse the Whaling
Cruise,
Address Explaining Fully the Cause
of the Change of Date to
Next Spring.
The executive committeefof the Carnival
of the Golden Gate, at a meeting held
yesterday, decided to announce that the
committee was in no way connected with
the proposed whaling expedition, nor
would they be benefited by the proposed
exhibition of a whale if captured. The
exhibit of whaling material at carnival
headquarters was also ordered removed.
Some months ago T. C. Wilds, the man
ager of the excursion, appeared before the
committee and offered 50 per cent of the
gross receipts of the exhibition. A few
days ago he was requested to put in
writing his offer made at that time, and a
copy of the offer as made to the committee
and taken down by the stenographer was
sent him. In reply he sent a letter alter
ing the terms and declining to sign any
contract for the present. The committee
thereupon decided to publicly announce
that they would have nothing to do with
the proposed exhibition.
The matter of incorporating the Golden
Gate Carnival Association was given con
siderable attention. The majority of the
members of the present committee are
strongly in favor of it. A committee con
sisting of Colonel O'Byrne, L. R. Ellert,
William T. Hess and W. H. Mills was ap
pointed to consider the matter and draw
up a plan that would cover it.
The following address, signed by tbe
members of the executive committee, was
adopted and ordered published:
The executive committee of the Carnival of
the Golden Gate to the citizens of San Fran
cisco.
Fellow-Citizent : We, the undersigned mem
bers of the executive committee of the Carni
val of the Golden Gate, feel it our duty to ad
dress you a few woras of explanation as to the
postponement of the carnival from October of
this year until the 19th of April, 1897.
After much preliminary work had been per
formed in canvassing for subscriptions, which
was largely successful, and the appointment of
Samuel H. Friedlander as director of the car
nival, it was intended to have it take place in
the first week of October. We found, how
ever, that the general opinion of our com
munity was not favorable to the projected en
terprise at tha time originally intended to
have it take place.
It was uniformly felt that the excitement
and intense interest in a Presidential elec
tion, always an important event, but appar
ently more so in the coming campaign, would
tend to draw off a great many persons from its
support who otherwise would be interested
and give efficient aid to the project. The feel-
Ing also among the merchants of the City,
from whom important aid and generous en
couragement would come, was as a whole op
posed to the carnival at that season of the
year, while they were not only favorable to but
promised heartily to support it if given in the
spring. The carnival director, whose great
aim is to make the festival esthetic in charac
ter as well as magnificent in^detail, was of the
opinion that it would not be possible to carry
out the design in all its artistic completeness
between now and the first week in October.
For these reasons, and these alone, the ex
ecutive committee, yielding to the consensus of
public opinion and to the judgment of the
carnival director, postponed the festival until
the week following Easter Sunday, 1897.
Upon Easter Moudsiy, April 19, 1897, the fes
tival will commence, and will continue every
day during the week, ending upon Saturday
night, April 24, with a grand ball in the Me
chanics' Pavilion, to close at midnight.
Tbe address is signed by all the mem
bers of the committee.
An ambitious composer sent in a musi
cal composition to be known as the
"Golden Gate Carnival March." Before
accepting it it was decided to offer a prize
for a march, to be submitted to the com
mittee before October 1, and which when
published will be known as the "Prize
Slarch of the Golden Gate." All sent in
will be submitted to a jury of musical
critics for determination as to the merits.
EARL'S VICTORY.
The Patent Refrigerator Man De
feats the Southern Pacific
Company.
The temporary injunction asked for by
Edwin T. Earl against the Southern Pa
cific and others to prevent the use of a
patent refrigerator-car was granted in a
decision by Judge Morrow in the United
States Circuit Court yesterday. This
practically decides the case.
This was a bill is equity brought by Earl
against the Southern Pacific Company,
Robert Graham and others for an alleged
infringement of a patent ventilator and
retrigerator-car. The cause was heard
upon a motion for a preliminary injunc
tion and upon motions to dismiss as
against the Southern Pacific Company and
Robert Graham for want o* jurisdiction,
on the ground that they are not inhab
itants of the Northern District of Califor
nia.
In conclusion Judge Morrow reviewed
certain general laws, ending as follows:
"In my opinion the defendants have not
made such a showing as to bring them
within the exception to the general rule.
The motion for a preliminary injunction
in favor of the complainant will therefore
be granted. "
