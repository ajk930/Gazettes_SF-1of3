Home of McKinley.
Four Thousand Wage-Earners
Show Loyalty to the Cause

OTHER DELEGATIONS ARRIVE.
To All the Visitors the Major Talks of
the Necessity of Sound Money
and Home Industry.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 17.â The com
manding feature of the day at Canton was
the great spontaneous labor demonstra
tion which took place iate in the after
noon. Four thousand Canton working
men called Â©n Major McKinley. They
" assembled at tne public square at 4 o'clock,
fell into line and. marched to Major Mc-
Kinley's house. All went quietly and
without ostentation. Hundreds of men
cane just as they left the mills, the foun
dries and the shops, attired in blue
blouses and carrying their dinner-pails.
The workingmen arranged the call them
telves and they tilled every inch of room
in the McKinley yard and were tigntly
wedged in. Several hundred could not
get within hearing distance of the
speaker. After the spokesmen, Messrs.
Krause and Jones, had made some re
marks and a glee club had beeu heard
Major McKinley c-aid:
1 have witnessed in front of this porch many
scenes which have touched my heart, but
none which have more deeply moved me than
this gathering of the workingmen of Canton.
Fringed about this assemblage are the wives
and the liule ones whom you love so much and
ior whom you want an opportunity to work.
I bid you all hearty and sincere welcome to
my home.
The currency, which since 1879 has been on
. a safe and sound basis, is now assailed by our
political adversaries. It involves the old
question oi the Honest payment of the public
debt and the pensions of our soldiers and of all
public obligations which the people long ago
determined on the side of good faith, good
morals and common honesty. But with that
settlement some people are not satisfied. So
we are called upon by them to pass upon this
question. There is still the question of pro
le Him against free trade or tariff reform. In
l>;Â»2frt-t; trade as agÂ»inet protection was the
paramount issue of the campaign, and free
i.t'iore the great tribunal of
the American yeople, and this year we bring
the question to you again. We ask you to re
view, to express your reconsidered and better
and moie matured judgment on ti.at issue,
I tiree years of dreadful experience.
I spoke in the city of Canton on Monday
evening, November 8, 1892, and in that
speech 1 appealed to fellow-citizens at home as
I had appealed to them elsewhere not to over
turn the protective policy which had brought
us such universal prosperity, and which at
that very moment was spreading its blessings
and benefits throughout the entire country
and in every industrial center, and in the
course of that speech I said what was true then
and what is true now. This is what I said
four years ago: "But. again, the Democrats
gay thai ii we have free trade we could buy
cheaper than we* do at present. Yes. We
might while the strugg.'e between American
and foreign industries was going on, but wiien
the former are wiped out the price wou'.d co
up to whatever figure might be dictated by
the foreign manufacturer, and in the mean
uine labor will be scantily employed and at
reduced wages. Frt-e trade cheapens the arti
cle by cheapening the artisan; protection re
duces the price <.f v product by giving the
artisan just reward ( for his labor and receiv
ing its reward on higher skilled industry.
Free trade cheapens the product by cheapen
ing the producer; protection cheapens the
produc: through the skilled geuius and indus
try of the producer. [Applause.]
But, my countrymen, nothing is cheap at
any price which comes from abroad that en
talis idleness upon the American people. [Ap
plause.l The maxim of free trade is "15uy
where you can buy the cheapest" I will give
you a maxim worth ten thousand times more
than that, "Buy where you can pay the
easiest.' 1 [Tremendous cheering.] But where
labor receives its highest reward, and that is
in the United States of America, or was four
years ago, during tne years of protection every
"manufactured product had been cheapened,
but in that process, thank God. men, living
men, had never been cheapened. While the
products oi the country had gone down in
price, labor up to 1892 had more than held its
own, and a workingman at that time was re
ceiving 00 per cent more for his'labor than he
received in 1800. Ail we have done by pro
tection is to take care of our own households
and great National family. That is what we
propose 10 do in the future by our ballots on
the 3d of November.
I paid another thing tnen: "If by your bal
lots you adopt this free-trade policy while
thiugs may b.' cheaper in the United States
you will have le.is iabor and less wages with
which to buy them." Was I rght, men of
Canton .' [Cries of "Yes."] Those were the
words spoken to you four years ago and were
my best and most mature convictions. Ido
not believe in my re.ations with you, with
man y of you for more than n quarter of a cen
tury, I have under aken to deceive or mislead
or mi-guide you. [Cries of -'You neverhave."]
My opinions may have been wrong, but they
were honest opinions, and none were more
.honest than thORC I expressed in 1892. How
ar they were truly and worthily spoken you
can now ju<Jg'. We have passed from the
field of prediction into the kingdom of fulfill
ment. [Laughter and applause] We have
pas-cd the period of prophesy si:)te then and
have experienced in our own homes, in our
own employments and in our own lives the re
mit of partial free trade and tariff tinkering.
You know the conditions in 181CJ. You know
the conditions now. Which do you prefer?
[Cries of "The conditions of 1892."]
My fellow-citizens: As if the dreadful ex
perience ol the last three years and a half was
not enough for our people to bear, we tinve in
jected into the campaign a new aid very
grave menace, affecting the currency of the
country. Tain m nace must be removed be

thÂ»t we cau do at home. The people must not

A large delegation from Erie County,
\"a., and one from Cambridge Springs,
Washington County, called on Major Mc-
Kinley thi3 afternoon. There were more
than 600 voters in the delegations. The
towns of Corry and Union City were
largely represented. Rev. W. E. Staitb of
Cambridge Springs addressed Major Mc-
Kinley at considerable length on behalf of
the visitors. Major McKinley responded
with a ringing speech, in which he coun
seled the people to be mindful of Con
gressional and Legislative elections this
fall, and then devoted the remainder of
his remarks to money and the tariff, quot
ing a strong paragraph from Macaulay's
histo.., of England describing the evils of
a debased currency in that country.
A large delegation from the northern
part of Chautauqua County, N. V., were
the next callers. Congressman W. B.
Hooker was the spokesman. Major Mc-
Kinley was greeted with a storm of ap
plause, and he made one of the most stir
ring speeches of the campaign.
Colonel William L. Osborne, secretary
of the Republican National Committee,
arrived in Canton to-day. Mr. Osborne
came from New York and is on his way to
Chicago to see Chairman Hanna. Colonel
Osborne is enthusiastic over the outlook.
"In the East," he said, "the fight is won.
It is now only a question of organization
for the purpose of seeing that every man
who wants to vote for sound money gets
to the polls. Our reports from other carts
of the country are highly pleasing and re
assurine. The work in the South is beine
done under the direction of Ihe New York
branch of the National Committee, and
we have reason to expect some very hand
some results from several Southern States.
I think the solid South will be broken and
that the result in that section will be a sur
prise to the country. Major McKinley's
great speech to the ex-Confederate veter
ans last week has helped us very much in
the South, for it has demonstrated to all
parties that he takes a { atriotic view of
the relations between various sections of
ihe country and that above all else he is
for National unity. The position of the
Republicans is growing stronger daily all
over the country, and will continue to do
so up to the last moment."
EAST A ND WEST NOT SEPARATED.
Torn Seed Speaks of Signs That Point
to Prosperity.
FORT WAYNE, Ixd., Oct. 15.â Thomas
B. Reed of Maine was tendered a perfect
ovation in Fort Wayne to-night. He ad
dressed the largest audience assembled in
this city this campaign and was escorted
by a long parade of marching clubs. It
was his first speech in the West this cam
paign and be said:
"I do not believe the West and the East
are separated. I think the same condi
tions exist here that prevail in the State of
Maine. She has designated the way of
prosperity and s>he always goes the way
she points. We are not following a man
who was not known sir months aÂ«o nor
choosing a man or the principles created
quite recently. We are no., following any
man who says, 'We believe.' We want
proof, history, facts. That is what the Re
publicans give you."
In conclusion he said he praised the
honest - money Democrats for their
honesty and integrity. He said a political
party is ruled by its majority and the
Chicago convention was governed by the
Popocratic majority, and that majority is
south of Mason and Dixon's line.

LANDSLIDES IN NOVEMBER.
They Are Predicted in Reports Made to
Republican Lender*.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 15.-Senator
Quay was early at National headquarters
this morning. The reports to the National
Republican Committee, received from all
quarters, are to the effect that a landslide
is expected in NovemDer.
John S. Wise of this city, who aas been
campaigning in his former State of Vir
ginia, called at Republican headquarters
to-day.
"So far as the actual vote i 3 concerned,"
said he, "we shall undoubtedly carry Vir
ginia, but whether that vote will be count
ed as cast is another matter."
A dispatch received from the Chicago
headquarters at the Republican head
quarters in this city to-day says: "Within
the last three days Mr. Hanna has re
ceived the most satisfactory reports from
the Pacific Coast. The situation in Cali
fornia, Oregon and Washington is assur
ing, and the reports all tell of the good
work being done by the speakers sent
there recently by the National Commit
tee."
ATTITUDE OF THE VATICAN.
Catholic Clergy cf the United States May
Be Instructed to Keep Out of
Folitics.
LONDON, E.ng., Oct. 15. â The Daily
News to-morrow will publish a dispatch
from Rome saying that the Vatican, al
though favoring the candidacy of McKin
ley, does not approve of the recent letter
of Archbishop Ireland, supporting McKin
ley, because it mixes religion and poli
tics, which the Vatican thinks should best
be separate in the United States. It says
that the letter will displease Eastern and
Southern Irish Catholics who support Mr.
Bryan. The dispatch adds that instruc
tions will perhaps be sent to Monsignor
Martinelli, the Papal delegate, concerning
the attitude of the Catholic clergy in the
Presidential campaign.

CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 15.â Order is about
to come out of the chaos in which the
Western freight rates have been involved
for some time past. The oanta Fe road

few days ago, and voted favorably on the
proposition to restore rates on the 2d prox.
This makes the action of the Western
lines unanimous, and seems to assure a
cessation of the rate-cutting that has been
the cause of so much irritation durine the
summer and fall.

FORCE THE WAY
Minister Terrell Desires
Turkish Wrath to Cool
a Little.
Then He Will Seek Permission
for the Bancroft to Go to
Constantinople.
CRUISE OF THE LITTLE VESSEL.
Consumes All Its Coal During the
Voyage of Many Thou
sand Miles.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 15.â A dis
patch was received at the Navy Depart
ment to-day from Admiral Self ridge, com
manding the American fleet in the Medi
terranean, stating that the Bancroft had
safely arrived at Smyrna.
It is said by officials in the Navy Depart
ment that the Bancroft must have almost
completely exhausted her coal supply in
her long trip of many miles across the At
lantic and upthe Mediterranean Sea, and
that she undoubtedly reached Smyrna
with her bunkers almost clear. The first
thing that must be done is to coal her, and
that will probable take several days as
there is no great hurry about it.
By the time she is ready for work it is
thought that the present complicated con
dition of things may have been straight
ened out and she may be allowed to go
peabeably and without protest to her des
tination, which is admittedly Constanti
nople.
When the story first came out yesterday
that the Bancroft had been ordered to
proceed to Constantinople whether the
Sultan consented or not, a strong effort
was made by those in position to know to
contradict the story. To-day, however,
they are less anxious to deny its truth.
But while partly admitting, they deny
that there is any danger of trouble.
According to the stories told now the
Bancroft was sent to the Mediterranean at
the urgent request of Minister Terrell,
who predicted troublous times and as
serted that the United States needed a
guardship at Constantinople; and it was
at nis suggestion that the Bancroft was
selected as being a vessel sufficient for the
purpose, yet not formidable enough to
give excuse for any serious protest.
While quiet reigns nt the Turkish cap
ital, Minister Terrell will probably not ask
for the firman permitting the Bancroft to
pass the straits, especially in view of the
alarming publications attributing to her a
distinctly hostile mission. These reports
are known to have been mortifying to the
Turkish authorities, as they were so totally
at variance with the uniform and repeated
assurances of this Government that the
presence of all our ships in the Levant was
amicable. It is believed therefore that the
effects of these stories will be allowed to
Buoside before the little ship proceeds to
Tchanak, at the entrance to the Dar
danelles, and that Terrell will await a more
favorable opportunity to ask her safe pas
saee to the Golden Horn.
With the Bancroft's arrival Admiral Sel
fridge now has his entire command di
rectly under his eye and according to his
instructions he will at once arrange their
crews to bring together all the men whose
terms of enlistment arc about expirine on
the Marbiehead in order that she may leave
with them for New York. This portion
of the programme can only be altered by
contingencies arising which might make
it advisable to keep the entire fleet to
gether fcr some further time.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Turkey, Oct. 15.â
United States Minister Terrell has lodged

mother of Prank Lenz, the Pittsburg bi

traveling through Turkey in 1895.
TEN DAYS BEHIND BARS,
That Is the Fate ot a Young
Man Who Blackmailed. a
Married Woman.
She Was Anxious to Secure a Letter
and Paid for It by Piece
meal.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 15.â J. H. A. Cum
mings, a young man who claims to be a
San Francisco newspaper reporter, was
placed on trial beiore Judge Clifford this
morning to answer to an indictment
charging extortion by threats. Harry Til
lenberg, who was named as an associate of
Cummings, was not present, the deputy
sheriffs having failed to locate him.
Mr?. Julia Barrata, wife of a stock
broker, caused the arrest of Cumminps
several months ago while he was keeping
an engagement with her to secure a sum
of money. One year ago Tillfiiborg be
came acquainted with Mrs. Barrata, at
that time Julia Adk-r.
He paid her attentions for several weeks,
when an estrangement took place, and the
young woman saw no more of him until
last June.
He then professed his desire to renew
their former friendship, but met wich no
success, as the young lady in the mean
time had married Barrata. In August
Cummings called on Mrs. Barrata with a
letter oi introduction from Tillenberg.
The husband was away at the time and
the wife granted Cummings an inverview.
He told his hostess that he had letters in
his possession which, if made public,
would result in her separation from her
husband.
She was surprised to find that Cum
mings had secured letters written by her
to Tillenberg prior to her marriage in Oc
tober, 1895, and had changed the dates.
Fearful of the scandal that she imagined
would result she cave $10 to her visitor
for hi 3 silence. Instead of getting the
dreaded lettsr she was only given a por
tion of it. This portion was just one-fifth
of the letter. Cummings made four more,
trips, each time securing $10 for the pieces
of paper. When the whole of the letter
had been purchased she hoped she had
seen the last of Cummings.
Her hopes were false, however, as he
appeared with another document. She
fhen took her husband into her confi
dedce, and arranged for the arrest of (Jum
mlugs.
The defense was that Cummings waa a
private detective engaged by Mrs. Barrata
on a family casÂ°, and that on learning
tliÃt he was an acquaintance of Tillenberg
she offered him $50 compensation if he
would get two letters in her former sweet
heart's possession.
Tillenberg is said to be well connected in
Chicago. Mrs. Barrata was not in court.
Cummings entered a plea of guilty. Judge
Clifford heard the evidence and sentenced
him to ten days in the County Jail.
COASTED DOWN TO DEATH.
Foreman Marsh Took a Foolish Slide
Down the Pikes Peak Cog
Road.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Oct. 15.â
H. C. Marsh, foreman of the Pikes Peak
cog road, died from injuries received to
day while coasting down the rack route
on a toboggan slide. He started from the
summit shortly after the passenger train
on an arrangement fitted up with a double
set of cleats to retain hold on the center
rack or cog rail of the road anrt which is
fitted with a peculiar braKe applied from
the sides. The rack rail is covered with
grease and oil, dripping from the hump
back engine, and is exceedingly slippery.
Marsh shot down the 16 per cent grade
like a bolt of lightning, taking the curves
with a speed that was hair raising. He
rounded Windy Point and started down
to the Halfway House, when the brake
broti'-> in an attempt to apply it, and the
toboggan, with nothing to impede it,
gained in momentum at a frightful rate.
The passcngar train that had left the
summit wasoverhauled and Marsh crashed
into it with terrible force, sustaining in
ternal injuries from which he died within
an hour. He was 33 years old, single and
came here from Dirlington, Mo., to which
place his remains will be sent for burial.

[Correspondence of The United Associated Preuea]
HAVANA. Cuba, Oct. 10 (via Tampa,
Fla.. Oct. 15).â The following is the ac
count of the last fight in Pinar del Rio,
gathered from information received here
from Spanish sources:
Maceo left the hills with about 2000 or
3000 men to meet an expedition which had
landed on the extreme point of the island,
somewhere about Dimas, which expe
dition, it appears, is not the one brought
by the Three Friends as reported, but one
fitted out in France or some other place
with Cuban funds collected in France,
and commanded by a well-known Havana
lawyer named Fernando Friere Andrade.
The expedition appears to have been the
most formidable ever landed in Cuba and
is said to have consisted oi about 5000,
rifles, 1,000,000 cartridges, 5000 blankets
and waterproofs, two or three cannon,
dynamite, medicines, etc.
Weyler, being informed of the landing
and that Maceo bad sent forces to convoy
the expedition to the hills, sent five
columns, in combination with each other,
to intercept his way and if possible to cap
ture the convoy. As a result of this com
bination there occurred five successive en
gagements, in which the Spaniards are
said to have lost over 600 men without
obtaining their coveted object, since
Maceo is now reported to have reached
the hills in safety without losing a single
pack mule on the convoy.
In *ll of these engagements Maceo has
outgeneraled all his foes and has demon
strated his great capacity as a military
leader and his remarkable skill and cour
age. Maceo, having succeeded in reaching
his mountain strongholds with ihe power-
ful elements he has now obtained, it can
be safely predicted that it will be utterly
impossible for the Spaniards to dislodge
him, as ii would require nearly 100,000
men for that purpose, according to the
opinion of well-informed and impartial
persons. There is no doubt that he has
sustained great losses, but everybody be
lieves that they are much smaller than
tuose of the Spaniards.
Calixto Garcia, with 5500 men and four
pieces of artillery, left the Bayamo district
recently in the direction of Camaguey. Ho
is believed now to be in that province to
join Gomez. His ultimate purpose is
unknown.
FOR A SUPREME EFFORT.
Spain Massing Troops to Conquer Cuba
or Give Vp.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 15.â A special
cable to the Herald from Cadiz, Spain,
says that a Spanish official is authority for
the statement that if Spain has not put
down the insurrection in Cuba by the first
of March it is the intention of the Gov
ernment to give rp the struggle and let
the island go. Spain is mas-sing troops on
the island for a supreme effort. McKin
ley F 3 election in March is feared by the
Spaniards, who think that if he occupy
the Presidential chair the United States
will take a more active iuterest in Cuban
affairs.
Toruas Estrada Palma, head of the Cu
ban Junta, was shown last night the dis
patch from Cadiz announcing the intended
evacution of Caba by the Spaniards. He
made no effort to conceal his satisfaction.
"It has cost Spain $11,000,000 a month to
sustain her army in Cuba. She is already
six months in arrears on account of the
island. She has no money and no credit.
She has, moreover, the Philippine revolt
on her hands. On the other hand the
Cuban position has grown stronger day
by day. We have between 30,000 and
40,000 men in the field, fully armed,
besides a like number armed with ma
chetes."
"If the Spaniards abandon the fight in
March, how will the belligerents be
treated? Will there be any reprisals?
"None whatever. Emphatically not.
The Cubans have been fightine for lib
erty; not from hatred of Spain. We shall
not imitate the cruelty of our enemy.
Any Spaniard choosing to lay down his
arms and remain as a non-combatant
will be welcomed by the Cuban Govern
ment on equal terms with the native Cu
bans. Indeed, we need their help to build
up the island.
"Our first work will be to establish a
permanent Government to take the place
of the Provisional Government which has
served during the war. It will be a Gov
ernment of, by and for the people, like
that established in tiiis country after the
War of tne Revolution. The island is dis
tracted by the corrupt Spanish rule and
by the war. We mast at once build up
and restore confidence in the ability of a
Cuban republic?"
"How about annexation ?"
"While our present purpose is to con
stitute by ourselves an independent State,
1 consider that Cuba is comrcercially an
nexed to the United States, for we are in
a great measure commercially dependent
on the United States. But we shall wel
come the end of the wcr, because it will
mean the end of the bloodshed and the
loss of property. Unless the Spanish sur
render it must continue indefinitely."
A Herald special from Havana, via Key
West, says: A Havana tobacco- buyer who
accompanied the column of General Mei
guizo and happened to be an eye-witness
of the latter' s engagement with Maceo's
insurgents in Pinar del Rio province
says Melguizo, on the morning after tbÂ«2
battle, had forty prisoners shot on the
field, including armed insurcents. Suarez
Incian, the assistant press censor at
Havana, was severely reprimanded by
Captain-General Weyler and temporarily
relieved for having neglected to blue
pencil a paragraph in a newspaper inter
view with General Bernal upon the latter's
arrival in Havana after his fight with

PERSIA'S NEW SHAH.
Musaffer-ed-Din Mirza to Be Enthroned
With Oreut Pomp.
TEHERAN, Persia, Oct. 15.â The cor
onation of the new Shah, which will soon
take place, will be one of the most memor
able events that has occurred in this
part of the East for many yeary. The new
Shah gets his place by virtue of the
assassin's bullet. On May 1, last year,
Shah Nasr-ed Din was killed while driving
in a carriage to the tomb-mosque of Shah
Abd-ul-Asun, a place of pilgrimage at Te
heran. The assassin was a follower cf the
Beet of the Babis. His successor is not
his eldest living son, but a Prince three
years vounger â Musaffer-ed-Din Mirza â
who was selected as Crown Prince when
he was still 5 years of age. Prince Mus
affer was Governor of the province of Azer
baijan, on the Russian frontier, and re
sided in the capital, Tabriz. Hitherto he
has distinguished himself by his fancy for
artillery, but in other branches of educa
tion he is behind his brothers. The suc
cessor to the throne is well liked by the
peopie, but he has no friends among the
powerful court society.

NEW YORK, N. V.. Oct. 15. - The
reorganization committee of the Colorado
Midland Railroad has issued a circular to
bondholders, stating that the disturbance
in money and the feeling in England
against American bonds made it unwise
to submit a plan of reorganization. So
to keep the present agreement in forep the
consent of certificate holders to an ex
tension to June 30, 1897, is asked.

in revenue is mainly due to free inter
change of traffic with connecting lines and
to a revival of mining industries in the

BRYAN DELIVERS
SIXTEEN SPEECHES
Record of the Second Day
of Campaigning in
Michigan.
Many Yellow McKinley Badges
Encountered by the Travel
ing Candidate.
RIVALRY BECOMES INTENSE.
Demonstrations &nd Counter-Demo
strations Along the Route of the
Nebraskan's Jcurney.
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Oct. 18.â
Three speeches in Grand Rapids rounded
up William J. Bryan's second day of cam
paigning in Micnigan. His field was the
lower peninsula, beginning at the Straits
of Mackinaw at daybreak. When he con-
eluded his remarks at the last of the
highly enthusiastic meetings here to
night he had added sixteen speeches
to his unprecedented list. Although the
day was raw and dusty Mr. Bryan drew
large crowds at every stop. As on yester
day, he encountered many of the yellow
McKinley badges that have caused him to
indulge in tart comments several times.
It was evident that the badges had been
distributed through some concerted
means, for they were nearly all alike,
those at one town being similar in size
and in pattern to those seen at another.
They were noticeable particularly by their
number at Traverse City, Cadillac and
Howard City.
There was intense rivalry between the
Republican and Democratic managers at
Big Rapids in the distribution of McKin
ley and Bryan ribbons, but as all were
white in color the Bryan people seemingly
made a better showing than their oppo
nents did. Some of Mr. Bryan's audiences
were very demonstrative, and ail along
the line of his progress he was well re
ceived from the time he began his speech
making to a crowd of early risers, just
after daybreaK, at St. Ignace on the west
shore ot the Straits of Mackinaw. Stops
were made during the day at Mackinaw
City, where Mayor Pingree, candidate for
Governor of Micnigan on the Republican
ticket, shivered in unobtrusive attentive
ness among the crowd; Petoslcey, Cbarle
voix, Bellaire, Traverse City, Cadillac,
Reed City, Big Rapids, Howard City,
Greenville, Belding, lona, Walton, Man
ton and Lowell, and at all except the iast
three speeches were delivered by the nom
inee. The Grand Rapids meetings, three
in number, far exceeded in attendance
any ot those addressed by Mr. Bryan en
route.
His biggest crowds along the way were
at lona, Big Rapids, Traverse City, Cadil
lac, Reed City and Belding, ranging in at
tendance from 2500 to 10,000. Altogether
it was a "very gratifying day to the candi
date in the numbers he drew and the en
thusiasm displayed.
Whea the nominee's train reached St.
Ignace on the Straits of Mackinac at 5:30
a. m. he found quite a large crowd of
shivering people waiting for him. AN
though Mr. Bryan had not eaten his
f breakfast and was attired only in night
shirt, trousers and overcoat he made a
good speech and was cheered vigorously.
The special train was taken across the
straits on a baige and reached Mackinaw
at 7 o'clock. Here was another large
audience o; 2000 or more, including a
crowd of excursionists. Mr. Bryan was
more suitably attired for .speech-making
and made a vigorous address. No less
than four brass bands were at hand and
despite the early hour the meeting was a
great success.
Mr. Bryan's third speech was made at
Petosky, where his train arrived at 8:25
and made a stop of twenty minutes.
More than 1000 people were in the crowd
that cheered the nominee, when Mr.
Hampton, the Democratic candidate for
Congress in this district, introduced him.
A number of men there wore badges in
scribed "An honest dollar," and noticing
these Mr. Bryan said:
"I want to address my remarks to those
who are wearing those badges on which
are written 'An honest dollar.' Ido not
know whether they are intended to mean
, that those who wear them are in favor of
a gold standard or free silver." "Sixteen
to one," shouted some one, and Bryan
smiled and did not make further refer
ence to the matter.
Several hundred people at Charlevoix
heard a brief speech from the ''greatest
hero of the nineteenth century," as Mr.
Bryan was called by the gentleman wlio
introduced him. A. short stop was made
at Bellair, and Mr. Bryan spoke to about
300 people.
At Traverse City, a lumber port on Lit
tle Traverse Bay, Mr. ana Mrs. Bryan
rode to a vacant lot in the town, where the
candidate, after an introduction by Mayor
Davis, delivered a speech. The crowd was
estimated atOOOO. Mr. Bryan said in part:
In advocating free coinage I don't mean to
claim that I am infallible, but 1 do wan: you
to understand that I believe what I say, and
that when I tell you that in my judgment
there can be no prosperity in this country
until bimetallism is restored to the American
people lam telling wbat I believe. [Cheers.]
Not only am I telling you what I now believe
but I am telling you what the Republicans
used to believe, although they have now sur
rendered their convictions and permitted
their party to act for them, instead of acting
for themselves. Mr. McKinley stands for a
financial policy that intends to make money
the master and till things else the servant;
he stands for a financial policy ,that intends
to make the property of the world cheaper
than it was ever before by making ihe money
of the world dearer than it was ever before.
At Reed City the congregation that
greeted Mr. Bryan numbered 2500, about
the same as at Cadillac, and showed con
siderable enthusiasm during his speech.
Yellow gave way to white in the way of
the badges worn by the gold people in the
crowd that saw and heard tne candidate
at Big Rap;ds, and ihe Bryan supporters
in tile town were not to "be outdone and
they, too, had provided for the distribu
tion of the ribbons bearing the Nebraska
man's name. White was also the color
used by the silver people, so nearly every
body in the audience of 4000 at Big Rapids
had white insignia of political faith. The
cheering was very hearty and Mr. Bryan
responded with a speech full of fervor.
Again wa3 the yellow McKinley
badges noticeable at Howard City, where
Mr. Bryan's audience numbered about
1500. Ail of the twenty minutes' stop was
taken up by the candidate's speech.
Charles R. Sligh, Democratic Union Silver
candidate for Governor of Michigan, with
his wife and daughter, joined Mr. Bryan
there and accompanied, him to Grand
Rapids. The 800 people gathered at
Greenville heard a short speech. Beld
ing. the location of the well-known silk
manufactories, turned ont at least 3000
of its inhabitants and residents of the
vicinity to give Mr. Bryan welcome.
Four white horses drew his carriage to the
Breaking- place, and sixteen young women
attired in white and silver shivered in the
raw atmosphere in company with their
comrade, whose dress carried out the in
tended typifk-ation of the ratio between
the two money metals. Much enthusiasm
was shown during tin nominee's ad
dress.
The largest crowd ol the journey was
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OUTOBEK 16, 18^(5.
encountered at lona, which was reached
at 7:15. The street ieading from w:>ere
the train hailed to the courthouse, where
Mr. Bryan spoke, a disiance of more than
100 yards, was thronged with humanity,
and when tbe candidate mounted the
stand erected over the courthouse steps he
faced a densely packed audience of be
tween 8000 and 10,000. Many bands had
been engaged for the occasion and the
half hour spent by Mr. Bryan there was as
elaborate a display as he has had in any
town of similar size. The enthusiasm was
rampant.
At 5:45 the Bryan special, with a car
containing -the Grand Rapids reception
committee attached, left lona for Grand
Rapids. It stopped on the way at Lowell
to iet some people see the nominee and
shout for him, and reached Grand Rapids
at 6:45 p. M.
From the time he reached Grand Rapids
until he escaped to his special train and
went to bed Mr. Bryan was the recipient
of a continuous ovation. A couple of
thousand people were at the Altfina,
Grand Haven and Milwaukee station when
he arrived in company with Charles R.
Sligh and J. R. Whiting t respectively can
didates for Governor and Lieutenant-Gov
ernor of Michigan on the Democratic
Union Silver ticket.
A special trolley car took him to Cres
cent avenue, where he got into a carriage
drawn by four white norses and was car
ried off in a roundabout way to avoid the
throngs in tne streets to Cam pa u Square
in the heart of Grand Rapids. An open
air meeting was scheduled there and it
proved to be one of the largest ever ad
dressed by the candidate. A fair estimate
placed trie size of the crowd at 25,000. Mr.
Bryan was well received. He was intro
duced by George Hummer, Democratic
candidate for Congress in this (the Filth)
district, and made a twenty-minute
speech and then hurried off to the Powers
House to address an enthusiastic audience
almost entirely composed of ladies. The
women adherents of tbe Bryan and Sewall
ticket in Grand Rapids had imitated their
sisters of Minneapolis and Duiuth and se
cured the opera-nouse for their exclusive
use.
After 'caving the Powers House Mr.
Bryan went to Locerby Hall and made
his third and last speech to the 5000
demonstrative people packed, jammed
and huddled together there. W. F. Mc-
Knight, who brought the Michican dele*
gation over to Bryan at Cnicneo, pre
sented tbe nominee, and John W. Tom
linson of Alabama followed in a speech
that was heartily received. When the
night's ordeal was over Mr. Bryan went to
the Livingston Hotel to get Mrs. Bryan,
who had been holding a reception there
with Mrs. Sligh, Mrs. Whiting and other
ladies, and together they were driven to
the Union depot, where the Bryan special
was in waiting. The train was taken to a
siding out of town, in order that the can
didate and his party might pass the night
undisturbed.
Strangely enough, Mr. Bryan's speech
to the ladies at Powers Opera-house to
night was the most important delivered
here. It contained some new material,
and was noticeable for Mr. Bryan's criti
cism of Messrs. lngersolJ, HalsteaJ, Car
lisle and Harrison. He said, in part:
You will remember that a few years ago
there was a great deal of talk about a char
acter. I don't know whether I ought to call it
a character or two characters, but it was Dr.
Jekyll 'and Mr. Hyde. You will remember
that the same persons appeared at different
times in different character.". One time the
man was a good man â benevolent, kindly dis
posed. At another time the same psrson was a
mean manâ a villian, seekfng to take human
iife. My friends, we have tne character of
Jeykil and Hyde illustratPd well when we
come to discuss the silver questiou, because
we can cite you a number of men who have
been both Jeykil and Hyde.
We can cite you a number ot men who nave
been kindly disposed and interested in the
public welfare at one time, and who, at an
other time, have bten supporting a system
that means more misery, according to Mr, Car
lisle, than a!l the wars, pestilences and
famines that have ever occurred in history.
[Applause.] I want to call your attention to
two or three persons who have said one thing
at one time and another thing at another
time on this money question. Onr opponi'ins
have been able to bring into this campaign all
the movable guns in the country. They have
enlisted on their side, and are sending out
over the country a great many pieces of large
artihery, and one <>i the ablest speakers they
have s|nt out is Colonel Ingersoll, who brings
to this money question his great abi lily as an
orator.
Mr. Ingersoll is now using his great weapon,
ridicule, against silver. Let me show you
what he once said on the other side of the
question and be will have to talk a long while
before he can answer what he has said on our
side, and I thins It is fair for us to assume
that we still have with us all of those who
have not been able to answer themselves.
Here is what he said in a speech some years
ago to farmers: "For my part I do not ask any
Interference on tlie part of the Government
except to undo the wrong it has done. I do
not ask ihat money be made out of nothing.
I do not ask for the prosperity born of paper,
but I do ask for the remonetization of silver.
Silver was demonetized by fraud. It was an
imposition upon every solvent man, a fraud
upon every honest debtor in the United States.
It assassinates labor. It was done lv the in
terest of avarice and greed and should be un
done by the honest men. The farmers should
vote only ior such men as are aMe and willing
to guard and advance the interest* of labor."
My Iriends, that is wbat he said when he
talked to the farmers some years ago. What
he said then was true; it is true now. Now
you will notrce that one of the most distin
guished journalists of the day, one- of the
most eminent men in his profession. Murat
Halstead, is doing all he can to maintain the
gold standard in this country. On the 24th of
October, 1877, Mr. Halstead said: "This Brit
ish gold policy was the work of experts only.
Evasion was essential to succeed in It, and
possibly becaus> coin was not in circulation
ai:d being out of public view, could be tam
pered with without attracting public atten
tion. The- monometallic system of the great
creditor nation was thus imposed upon the
great debtor nation without debate."
The monometallic system of the great credi
tor nation was thus imposed on the debtor
Nations of the world because the United
States is a debtor nation, and Mr. Halstead
calls it a British policy.
It was a British policy; it is a British policy
to-day and ail we ask is to replace a British
policy with an American financial policy. In
another place in his letter he explains the ad
vantage of bimetallism. He soys- "The
metals support and regulate each other. The
two afford adequate basis for an abundant
currency and neither can be 'cornered' in aid
of the speculative schemes that are often pre
paredrHml always opposed to the general wel
fare." And again: "If one metal rated ac
cording to the fixed ratio becomes demone
tized tne option of payment in the cheaper
coin makes a demand for it, that enhances its
value and the money unit is subject to slighter
flucauations in comparison with commodities
than is found in but one metal. Copper and
steel together in the compensation balance
wheel oi a chronometer and perfectly measur
ing time through all temperatures Illustrates
the principle." So that Mr. Halstead at that
time understood that the gold standard was a
British policy and he understood the advan
tages of the double standard.
John Q. Carlisle, who to-day stands as the
representative of those DemocaAts who believe
in thegold standard, spoke on this subjest in
1878. in that speecn he said: "This contest
must not cease and will no: cease until the in
dustrial classes are fully and finally emanci
pated from the heartless domination of syndi
cates, stock exchanges ana combines of motiey
grabbfrs in this country and In Europe." He
went even further than that, lie said: "We
will pass measure after measure of relief, and
if the President vetoes ihose measures and we
cannot pass them over his ve;o, we will put
them in the appropriation bill with tne dis
tinct understanding that if the people can get
no relief the Government shall get no money."
Do you tnowof any more emphatic condemna
tion than that? And yet that heartless domi
nation still continues.
In 1889 Benjamin Harrison was elected
President, and in his platform I find these
words: "Th* Republican party is in favor of
the use of gold and silver as money, and con
demus the policy of the Democratic adminis
tration in its efforts to demonetize silver"
There is a Republican candidate for the Presi
dency elected on a platform which condemns
the previous administration on the ground
that it had attempted to demonetize silver,
and yet this condemnation of Cleveland was
infinitely worse than the iirst one so far as the
money question was concernsd, and yet the
President who was elected on a platform de
nouncing Mr. Cleveland's former administra
tion is advocating the election of a Republican
candidate who indorses Mr. Cleveland's second
financial policy. [Applause.]
MORTON ROASTS BRYANITES,
Turns the Tables on the Men Who Dared
to Criticize Him.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 15.-Secre
tary Morton has expressed himself in
caustic terms to the managers of the
Democratic campaign. Tha difficulty
arose out ol tne alleged issue of a
bulletin from Democratic headquarters
charging the Secretary of Agriculture with
pormittine the employment of his em
ployes during office hours in addressing
gold standard campaign circulars and
sending them out nnder'the frank of Sen
ator Caffery of Louisiana. This statement
being shown to Secretary Morton he de
nounced the author of it as a willful liar.
Then, speaking of what He called "Bryan
Democrats," he added :
The finance which they teach is entirely Con
federate fiat. In the Southern Confederacy
the same leaders wuo are now in command of
the picket guards for free s Ivor at 16 to 1
were leading financiers. And Harris, Pugh,
Morgan and the other Confederate generals
now in command oi Bryan's campaign seem to
<lesire to accomplish "by false Jinance that
which the failedy to bring about by arms-
National dishonor and disgrace.
Secretary Morton further produced the
following letter, which he said had been
addressed to all the postmasters in Ne
braska:
Omaha, Nebr., September 15, 1896.
Dear Sir: We address this letter to you,
knowing that you are one ot the leading Dem
ocrats of your'county, and believing you have
the success of our party at heart and desire to
aid the election of Bryan and Sewall. Iv order
to overcome the nominal Republican majority
in this State the committee must have fiinds
with which to perfect a thorough organization.
We can expect no aid from ti:e National
Committee and have no funds in hand now
with which to begin work. We urge you to
make an earnest effort among your irieuds to
raise the sum of $100. to ba used by the com
mittee in defraying the necessary expenses of
thecampsign. If you cannot raise this sum
at once will you not guarantee the committee
that the Democrats of your vicinity will con
tribute the amount required by the 10th of
October?
This committee hos no enemies to punish
and will appreciate and gratefully remember
the kind assistance of those Democrats wno
come to the aid of our party in its hour of
neea. Our success in the Nation is assur?d.
Let each of us do our part to carry Nebraska
by a large majority. Do not fail to write us at
once. Yours truly,
James C. Dahlmann, Chairman.
Lee Hukdmax, Secretary.
"I should Jike to have our Democratic
friends know," added Secretary Morton,
"that this same James C. Dahlmann, who
asks for these funds, was formerly a gold
Democrat and wanted office under the
present administration, but was turned
down for personal reasons." Â£
STEVENSON ON THE STUMP."
first Campaign Speech Made by the
Vice- President.
MIDWAUKEE, Wis., Oct. 15.â Vice-
President A. E. Stevenson addressed an
audience of about 1500 people at the Dav
idson Theater this evening. Several thou
sand people were unable to gain admis
sion to the theater, and as the street in
front of it bad been torn up, no overflow
meeting could be held.
On the stage were over 700 of the leading
Democrats of Wisconsin, among whom
were many prominent Federal office
holders. Mr. Stevenson was introduced
by Judge Mallory, an old-lihe Democrat,
who has been prominent for years as a
silver advocate.
The Vice-President was treated to a
great ovation on being introduced. Mr.
Stevenson was referred to by one of the
speakers who followed him as the Demo
cratic end of the present administration,
a sentiment that was loudly cheered.
This was the first campaign speech de
livered by the Vice-President in'the pres
ent contest outside of his own State. Mr.
Stevenson said that an axiom of Napoleon
had been, "All for the people, nothing by
the people." The axiom of Thomas Jef
ferson had been and was the living faith
of the Democratic party for 100 years:
"All for the people and by the people."
[Tremendous applause and cheers.] Con
tinuing, he said:
â¢â¢I make no question as to the honest
conviction of those who give their honest
support to the ticket nominated at Indi
anapolis. The fact remains, however, that
the contest for the Presidency rests solely
between Bjyan and MÂ«Kinley.''
The speaker then asked whether the
public interests would best be served by
the success of the Democratic party or the
return of its great antagonist to power.
He called attention to the fact that for
thirty years previous to the election of
President Cleveland there was not a single
moment when the Democratic party con
trolled the Presidency and the Senate and
House at the same time, and therefore all
the legislation which has brought on its
train financial disaster must be laid at the
doors oi the Republican party.
He referred to the "enforced idleness
and the wrecked fortunes" which foliowe J
the demonetization of silver in 1873. and
then proceeded before taking up the silver
question to say a few words on the tariff,
and asked his hearers if they were ready
to return to the schedules of the McKinley
law for the most unjust tariff schedules
known to our history. He claimed that
the victories of the Democratic party in
1890 and 1892 were the result of the revolt
against the McKinley law.
"He then took up the monetary question
and quoted McKinley, Carlisle, Blame
and other economists to show that the
Republican party had never dared to de
clnre unqualifiedly in favor of the gold
standard until 189b". His peroration was a
splendid encomium of the Democratic
party. which he said had existed ever since
the constitution was adopted.

They have been sold out and their party made
a footniat for Democratic politicians to wipe
their feet on, under the hypocritical pretense
of patriotism.
The fusionists have abandoned principle
and gone into a mud scramble for the pie
counter. If Bryan is defeated it will be the
inu'.t of the traders in his own party and onrs,
who have ignored the St. Louis compromise
and tried to force the Populists to vote for
Sewall, the bondholder, National banker, cor
poration plutocrat and "gold clause million
aire." Thomas E. Watson.
WAISON ON THE WARPATH.
Editorially Roasts Democratic Managers
and Senator Stewart.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Oct. 15.â A special
to the Post from Atlanta, Ga., says:
Thomas E. Watson says editorially to
day that it looks as ij tne Democratic
managers wish to defeat Bryan or el.se
they woefully lack wisdom, bavins; done
ail they could to drive away the Populist
vote.
"Pie has been plentifully dished out to
pie-hunters," says he. "In North Caro
lina, Kansas and Colorado Populist prin
ciples have been ignored and the National
ticket set aside.. Bryan is beine slaugh
tered by his own managers. They are
sacrificing him to Eastern money powers
as represented by Sewall and their own
desperate determination to wreck the
People's party."
Another editorial roasts Senator Stewart
of Nevada, saying he was a party to "the
crime of '73," and calling him "the Breck

LONGEST BASE
LI NE ON EARTH
Completion of the Most
Stupendous Geodetic
Survey.
After Fifty Years' Work the
Great Transcontinental Arc
Is Established.
IT COST ONE MILLION DOLLARS.
But the Government Officials May
Expect Congratulations From the
Scientists of the World.
WASHINGTON, IX C, Oct. 15.â The
Coast and Geodetic Survey has just con
cluded its labors in the field upon the most
stupendous geodetic survey undertaken
in any country, and which gives to the
United States the longest base line upon
which to establish subsequent surveys in
existence in tbe world. It is known as the
transcontinental arc and lies along tne
39th parallel of latitude, extending from
ocean to ocean. Its eastern end is at a
point on the Atlantic ten miles south of
Little Egg Isiand lighthouse, below Cape
May, and its western end is six miles north
of Point Arena lighthouse on the Pacific,
above San Francisco several miles.
* According to the radius of the 39th par
allel, as given by Besse!, the famous as
tronomer of Kingsburg, Germany, who
first calculated the diameters of the earth
and measured the distance irom the earth
to 61 Cygni, the nearest fixed star, the
leiigth of the arc, as measured by the
Coast and Geodetic Survey officials, is 111
feet in error, and according to the radius
of the same parallel, as fixed by Sir Andrew
Clarke of Glasgow University, the error is
98^ Jeet.
But General Duffield, superintendent of
the survey, declares that these variations
from the heretofore established standards
show error in them and not in the calcula
tion of his scientists. By the measure
ments made on the line and which have
been aggregated in the office here the arc
at sea level for the entire distance, that is
following the curvature of the earth's sur
face, is 2625.8 miles in length. The estab
lishment of the radius of the thirty-ninth
parallel from those measurements is a
matter of future calculation.
The vastness of the work just accom
plished cannot be appreciated by the un
scientific mind. It was inaugurated by
the survey nearly if not quite half a cen
tury ago. Progress upon it has been spas
modic, but some work was done every
year since the beginning:. It has cost the
Government about $1,000,000, but the ex
penditure is said by the officials to be
fully justified by the importance of the
project.
Russia and China are the only other
countries on the globe where a base line
of anything like equal magnitude is pos
sible, and in neither one is it likely to be
surveyed for many years. The longest
base line heretofore surveyed was that in
India, running north and south about a
thousand miles in length. European
scientists have been greatly interested in
the progress of the American arc and its
completion will doubtless be the occasion
of the receipt by the geodetic survey offi
cials of many congratulations from
abroad.
NOT GOING TO CENIRAL AMERICA
The Oregon Merely Ordered to Santa
Barbara for Gun Trials.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 15.â A re
port reached "Washington to-day that the
French war vessel Duguay Trouin, now
at San Francisco for dockage, had been
suddenly ordered to Central America, and
that the United States ship Oregon would
follow her soon after her gun trial trip.
Ihe Call correspondent saw Navy De
partment officials to-day, one of them
said:
"There is nothing to call our vessels to
Central America. The only affair that
threatens any â  sort of international
difficulty, is that affecting the American
missions in Peru, and that js not regarded
as of any importance. Besides the United
States ship Marion is now off Iquique and
competent to take care of Uncle Sam's
people."
Admiral Ramsey, Chief of the Bureau of
Navigation, was then seen by the Call
correspondent. He stands next to Secre
tary Herbert in authority. He 3aid: ''The
Oregon will not be ordered to Central
America. Not much. This report proba
bly arose from the fact that she is going
to Santa Barbara for gun trials."

CONDUCTS HIS 0WN CASE
Price's Appeal to the Supreme
Court Admitted by Chief
Justice Fuller.
This Is a Condition That Has Existed
but Once Before in the Tri
bunal's History.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Oct. 15.â A case
was docketed in the Supreme Court to
day under conditions that have obtained
but once before in the history of the court.
Warren E. Price, a bookseller of San
Francisco, was convicted in the District
Court for the northern district of Cali
fornia of using the mails for the purpose
of advertising obscene books and sen
tenced to pay a fine tti $500 and to be
imprisoned for eighteen months.
He appealed the case to the Supreme
Court of the United States last spring, but
it could not be docketed under the roles of
the court for the^ason that the attorney
was not a member of the bar of the Su
preme Court of the United States. He ad
vised his client, however, that the case
could be docketed upon bis personal ap
pearance, and Price offered this. But
that was rejected by the clerk under the
rules.
On Monday last Solicitor-General Con
rad moved the court that the case be
docketed and dismissed ior failure to
prospcutc the appeal. To-day Chief Jus
tice Fuller announced that the motion to
dismiss would be overruled, and the clerk
was ordered to docket the case. Price will
be allowed to prosecute it in propria per
sonje.
On Monday next the Government will
move to advance the case for an early
hearing.
TO SUCCEED SEARDSLEE.
Commodore Miller of the Boston -\avy
Tard Will Probably Be Promoted.
NEW YORK, Eng.. Oct. 15.â A Tribune
special from Washington says: There is
much talk among naval officers regarding
the successor of Admiral Beardslee, com
mander-in-chief of the Pacific station.
The impression prevails that Com
modore J. N. Miller, the command
ant of the Boston navy-yard, will
be assigned to this duty. He is
the senior officer of his grade, and
has not been at sea since 1892, when he
was a captain. He is entitled to a com
mand afloat, and should exercise this
authority before he is advanced to the
highest grade of the navy.
Another officer also spoken of for the
place is Commodore George Dowey, for
merly of the Portsmouth navy-yard.
He has not been Â£ft sea since 1888. He
is anxious to have a command commen
surate with his rank, which entitles him
to the control of a fleet.
Can Be Beaten in Kansas.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 15. â Chairman
Hagan of the' Kansas committee of the
National Democratic party wrote to
National headquarters asking for speakers
on account of the inroads which the gold
sentiment among the Democrats had re
cently made upon the silver forces of that
State. He predicted that with an extra
ordinary pull for Palmer and Buckner,
Bryan could be defeated in Kansas and
Populism given a crushing blow.

Confession of Many Crimes Made

Letter to His Wife.
SAID HE WOULD END HIS LIFE.
Series of Daring Forgeries and Pecu
lations by Juneau's Mcst Promi
nent Business Man.
JUNEAU, Wis., Oct. 15.â A1l doubt as
to the character of W. T. Rambusch, one
of the most prominent men of this city,
whose disappearance last week led to an
investigation which disclosed business
transactions that were, to say the least,
questionable, were removed this morning
when a letter was received from bim mak
ing a confession which fully substantiates
the apprehensions of even those who
feared the worst.
The letter was dated at Philadelphia
and was addressed to his wife. The most
startling information the letter contained
was the assertion that Mr. Rambuech con
templated taking bis own life. In fact, it
is believed that he expected to be dead be
fore the letter reached Juneau.
To-day's developments in the case have
shown that Ilnmbuscli had operated with a
boldness that is startling. This morning
a set of keys was found, which proved to
be duplicates for all the offices and vaults
in the Courthouse, and the further discov
ery was made that the official records nave
been tampered with. It seams that Ram
busch had privileges extended to him be
cause of his high standing that could not
have been granted by the officials to any
body else. People are coming to town by
the score to see what they have lost, and
new steal* are being discovered every honr.
It is now known beyond all doubt that
Rambusch drew fraudulent mortgages,
signed the names of the holders of the
land and filed the mortgages. The amount
of his defalcations it is now believed will
reach in the neighborhood of about
$500,000.
Most startling revelations are now being
made in rearavd to the burning of the
Dodge Courthouse and the destruction of
all records in 1877. The fire was laid at
the door of a defaulting County Treas
urer, but the then District Attorney hav
ing reason to believe that Rambusch had
set fire to the building and Dad such good
'grounds that he employed Pinkerton de
tectives to work up tne case. They found
evidence tendiug to prove that Rambuscn
was tbe truilly man, but it was not suffi
cient to mak. a case and the matter was
dropped.

CYCLED TO OMAHA
FROM SAN DIEGO
W. C. Murdock Makes the
2200 Miles in Thirty
Three Days.
Twice Functured His Wheel and
Is Held Up by Two
Tramps.
RUNS OVFR A RATTLESNAKE.
Sleeps Out, Huugrr, With Money in
His Pocket, and Takes InnuÂ»
merable Headers.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Oct. 15.â M. C. Mnr
dock, a young lather living in this city,
returned to-night from Omaha. He went
there from San Diego on lys wheel, leav
ing here June 28 at 4 a. m. and arriving at
Omaha oa July 30 at 6 p. m.. making 2200*
miles by wheel in the thirty-three days.
"I went via San Francisco, Oakland,
Sacramento, Ogden and Cheyenne," said
Murdock last night. "Except for tne dis
tance between Green River and Cheyenne,
Wyoming, I made tne entire distance by
wheel. It was a great experience. I
punctured my wheel twice, was held
up by a tramp, rode over a rattle
snake, went through two rainstorms, slept
out hungry with money in my pocket,
took innumerable headers, and had an
experience with a pair of as gentlemanly
horsethieves as ever cut a throat Noth
ing happened in California except the
first puncture. I left hero with a whole
lot of truck, extra clothing, sponge,
towels, etc. By the time I had reached
Sacramento I shed them and took every
thing off down to my sweater, knickers
and helmet. I even took the name-plato
off tne wheel, so as to get down to march
ing order. I followed the Union Pacific
wherever practicable, riding on the track.
"It was in the snowsheds near Cisco on
July 8 that I was held up. A tramp came
at me wi'h a club and demanded $5, but
I got my gun out and he tried to turn it
off as a joke. Out on the Nevada deserts
I often went hungry and had to sleep un
der the dense foliage of telegraph-poles.
Between Reno and Wadsworth I went on
to the country road and it began to rain.
My tire was punctured atrain and I was in
a bad fix all around. Tnere was a little
house half a mile off tlie road, and I went
there to get shelter ana fire to fix my tire.
"A man came to the door bristling with
guns. He had two revolvers on and a
Winchester in his hand. He greeted me
cordially enough, and I went inside.
Then another young fellow came in
through a side door, and he was armed
the same way â two revolvers and a rifle.
On the table was another riflp, and there
were guns and knives scattered about.
They treated mo well, and I stayed all
night. They told me they kilied wild
horses for their hides. One of the fellows
said: 'Occasionally there is a branded
horse among the others, and of course wo
don't know it when we shoot. After it is
killed it might as well be skinned, but if
the owrrer caught us at it there would be a
shooting match rignt there. So we carry
our guns ready for any emergency.'
"When 1 offered to pay the next morn
ing they would take nothing. Think of
it. It was between Julesburg and Big
Springs, Nebr. , that I ran over the rattle
snake. He was lying right across the
road in the early morning and the air was
quite chilly. I was scorching along to
keep warm, and was on the snake before I
knew it. 1 could not stop, so just hoisted
my feet up lo the handle-bars and let her
go. I tell you my hair curled there for a
minute; but the snake was stretched out
and did not have time to coil. The wheel
stood the trip remarkably well, and be
yond the two punctures and worn tires I
had no trouble."
Tiihmni Speaks at Salem.
SALEM, Or., Oct. 15.â United States
Senator Ben A. TiUman spoke here to
night at the Second Regiment armory to
2000 people. His audience was about
equally divided between Democrats, Pop
ulists, Republicans and ladies.
The address was appreciated more from
the celebrity of the speaker than from any
potency of logic or vote-winning peculiari
ties. He was exactly twenty-four hours
ahead of the time set by the silver com
mittee and his unexpected arrival set
them all asroj; with confusion.
However, he made a good impression by
the moderateness of his address, which
was a disappointment to many who
anticipated something sensational. He
has an itinerary involving ten more
speeches in this State and Jeaves for tho
lowa and Michican campaign-field on
Friday, the 23d inst. He was preceded on
the rostrum by M. A. Hurley of Sau Fran
cisco.

Los Axgeles, Cal., Oct. 15.)
Some time last night Moiitz Rosenberg,
a Hungarian Jew, said to be well known
in businejÂ»s circles in San Francisco, where
be now has a married daughter, and who
resided with his wife and two sons, Harry
and Louis, at 730 West Seventn street,
this city, quietly arose from the side of
his wife, dressed himself and walked back
into a small pantry opening upon the
dining-room, locked himself in and then,
lying down upon his left side on the floor,
held the revolver to his head and pulled
the trigger. The ball entered the right
temple and passed through the brain,
came out on the opposite side and buried
itself in. the floor. His absence was un
noticed until this morning, when his
wife awoke and gave the alarm. The dead
man's son Harry instituted a search and,
finding the pantry locked, burst in the
door and discovered the body on the floor
bathed in blood.
Deceased removed to this city from San
Francisco about one year ago. He bad
been a jeweler and was possessed of con
siderable means. Shortly after coming
here he engaged in the tailoring business
under the name of the Eagle Woolen
Mills, on South Broadway. Lack of ex
perience and ceneral business depression
caused him to close out his interest. He
then opened a jewelry ttore at 344U South
Spring street, in which business "he was
engaged up to the time of his death.
Business reverses had preyed on his mind
and for the past week he had remained at
home, melancholy and depressed.

SCHOONMAKER
SPEAKS AT NAPA
Fifteen Hundred People
Packed in Maple
Hall.
Meeting Preceded by a Torch
light Parade, Fireworks
and Music.
WILD ENTHUSIASM PREVAILS
Many Unique Transparency Mottoes
in the Procession Are a Source
of Merriment.
NAPA, Cal., Oct. 15.â One of the largest
rallies ever held in Napa County was the
Republican rally held here this evening.
Mr. Schoonmaker arrived on the evening
train and was driven to the Palace Hotel.
The parade was formed at the Republican
headquarters and marched to the hotel
and escorted the speaker to Maple Hall,
the finest hall in Napa. The rally was a
boomer. The streets were crowded by the
people who came to witness the parade.
All along the line of march there were
continuous cheers for McKinley and Ho
bart and the different nominees of the Re
publican party. Those forming the par
ade manifested the utmost enthusiasm
end added their cheers to those of the
otheis. The line was made up of mem
bers of the McKinley and Hobert clubs
and friends of protection and sound
money, all carrying torches. Many in the
parade were on horseback. The many
transparencies carried added much to the
interest. The following were among the
mottoes: "The bill maturing November
3â Bill McKinley," "Sound dollars, sound
cents and sound sense," "We favor the
free coinage of American muscle," "Open
the mills and the mints will open them
selves/ and many others.
Sheriff George S. McKenzie acted as
grand marshal and selected the following
aids, who accompanied him on horseback:
Messrs. Turner, Vallejo, Brownlee, Horst
meyer, McFarland and Levansaler. The
many fireworks that were fired off during
the march added much to the brilliancy
of the occasion. A large bonfire was also
lighted on the principal corners of the
streets. Long before the procession reached
Maple Hall the room was crowded, with
no standing-room for many who wished to
gain admittance. At the least calculation
there were 1500 people in the hall. Thomas
D. Derry, a leading young Republican of
Napa, called the meeting to order. Besides
the music furnished by the band, most
appropriate selections were rendered by
the Republican Glee CluD, under direction
of E. S. Gridley. H. M. Barstow, a promi
nent attorney of Napa, was then intro
duced as president of the evening. Mr.
Barstow is a pleasing speaker, and with
appropriate remarks he introduced F. X.
Schoonmaker to the Napa people. Mr.
Schoonmaker is a speaker of National rep
utation, and his address to the Napa people
was able and well deserved the applause
that was frequently given. The meeting
closed with three cheers for McKinley and
Hobart and other nominees of the Repub
lican party.
SAN ANDREAS NALLY
One of the Greatest Political Meetings in
the Town's History.
SAN ANDREAS, Cal., Oct. 15.â The
most enthusiastic political meeting held
in thi3 town during the present campaign
took place this evening. Ex-Governor H.
11. Markham and Hon. John F. Davis of
Amador County were the speakers, and
the people of the town gave them a perfect
ovation. During the day an enthusiastic
meeting of the Calaveras branch of the
State Miners' Association was heJd in the
courthouse, bringing large numbers of
people to our town. On the arrival of
Governor Markham and Judge Davis from
Angels in the afternoon they were re
ceived by an enthusiastic crowd, led by
the cornet band. This was the beginning
of the enthusiasm among the people that
grew more and mere pronounced as the
hour of speaking drew near. At 7 o'clock
bonfires were burning, guns were fired
ana immense crowds poured into the town
hall.
When the meeting opened there was
scarcely standing room. Senator E. C.
Voorheis of Amador County was the
chairman and in an enthusiastic address
introduced Governor Markham to the
audience. The Governor was received
with prolonged caeers, for he is an old
time acquaintance of the people of this
place. For over an hour he" held the
audience in one of the most logical and
convincing arguments on the issues that
has ever been delivered in this place. His
address wass interspersed with anecdotes
and pointed illustrations that made a tell
ing impression on the audience. *
The Governor was followed by Judge
Davis of Amador, the orator who is doing
more throughout this portion of the State
in the cause of Republicanism than any
other man. His address was considered
the best that he has ever delivered in this
town and made a profound impression.
Being intimately known to our people,
his appeals in the cause of good govern
ment ana sound money made many con
verts from the Democratic ranks. The
meeting closed with cheers and the firing
of guns.

The Eloquent Toumj Latryrr Addresses !
four Thousand People.
SAN DIEGO, Cal:, Oct. 15.â William 8.
Barnes in his speech to-night on the plaza
devoted his attention mostly to the Mc-
Kinley tariff. He spoke to over 4000 peo
ple and was given close attention. He re- !
ferred to the number of worklngmen in
San Francisco during the operation of the
McKinley law and the great decrease since
the Wilson bill wont into effect, and asked,
"Do we want the McKinley law?"
"Yes, yes," went up with a big roar
from his hearers.
Mr. Barnes' presentation of the usually
dry tariff subject was so plain and inter
esting that h*> won the highest praise from
the Republican manager?, who say the
speech will make many votes here. ' Re
garding the Chicago platform Mr. Barnes
said:
"One of the planks of that platform reit
erates the old doctrine of States' rights
and stirs up the passion of sectionalism.
I am one of those Americans who believe
that the flag of this Union can be carried
into any State to enforce the laws to over
throw anarchy and preserve property.
[Great applause.]
"Another thing advocated by the un
speakable platform of Chicaeo is that
there shall be r.o more government by in
junction. What is that aimed at except
the highest tribunal under the judg
ment bar of heaven, the United States
Supreme Court?Â£That court, the bulwark,
of the people's liberty, the very palladium
of our freedom, is attacked by the horde
of secessionists and anarchists who ob
tained control of the old Democratic party
at Chicago. That court must be preserved
free from political strife and passion to
dispense even-handed justice to the peo
ple and to stand in defense of^ the people.
When legislators pass obnoxious or un
constitutional laws, when demagogues
obtain control of Congress and oppress
the people, the only safeguard is the Su
preme Court, which will preserve the
original ideas of the fathers of our liberty,
no matter how large the majorities in
Congress.' 1
GO OD SPEAKERS AT ANGELS.
Ex-Governor Markham and Judge John
F. Davis Arouse the Republicans.
ANGELS, Cal., Oct. Itâ The citizens of
this community turned out in force last
nigh; to hear ex-Governor H. H. Mark
ham and Judge John F. Davis speak upon
the political issues of tne campaign. The
welcome to Markham was a warm one and
showed him that the friendship of the
mountains is still his. The meeting was
intensely enthusiastic and has done more
than all others thus far held in the county
to fire the Republican heart and to swell
the flowing tide for McKinley and the
whole Republican ticket.
Ira Hill Reed, candidate for Judge of the
Superior Court, presided at the magnifi
cent demonstration at Doland's Hall.
Ex-Governor Markham was the first
speaker and as he arose it was some mo
ments before the cheering audience al
lowed him to proceed. He reviewed the
history of the Democratic party for the
last three years and showed the incon
sistency and incoherency of its record
with a lucidity and earnestness that car
ried his audience with him.
The plenitude of their promises and the
poverty of their results were candidly pre
sented to the people. His comparison of
the successful management of a mine
with that of a government and bis de
scription of the business insanity of the
proposition to allow the same set of peo
ple who had set aside Harrison and
plunged this Nation into a debt of $262,
-000,000 in three years under one manage
ment now to come forward and ask to
dictate his successor was received with a
storm of applause. His speech has done
a world of good for the Republican cause
in this community.
Judge John F. Davis devoted himself to
a discussion of the position of the Repub
lican party upon the question of silver.
He avoided all* partisanship and discussed
the question squarely upon its merits, and
was enthusiastically applauded through
out His references to the "white terror"
of the Utica mine management in this
vicinity and his statement that the only
mills which Bryan would over start would
be the windmills of the' United Slates were
cheered to the echo.
KAIGHT AT STOCKTON,
Captures the Hearts of an Immense As
semblage.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 15.â The big
Agricultural Pavilion was again filled to
night by a large audience that gathered to
listen to George A. Knight, who came up
by special engine to address the people of
Stockton. Tne big building was well nigh
filled long before the meeting was called
to order by Chairman T. A. Nelson of the
County Central Committee. E. C. Dickin
son of Ripon was selected as chairman,
Bnd the leading men of the community
were upon the platform as vice-presidents.
Arthur H. Ashley of Stockton was the
first speaker, and his address was listened
to with deep interest. Before the intro
duction of the first speaker the McKinley
and Hobart Club of Stockton passed in re
view before the platform, whereat the au
dience gave rousing cheers for the Repub
lican nominees for President and Vice-
Exesident.
It was after 9 o'clock before the speaker
of the evening arrived. He was greetsd
with rousine cheers, and the closing words
of Ashley's address were drowned in the
clamor, in scite of the fact that the Stock
ton man's effort was an able and tellinj;
one. Mr. Knight was soon in the hearts
of his audience, and when he said that the
city of Stockton had a practical illustra
tion of the combination of labor and capi
tal, and the necessity of the labor and
capital joining hands, in the building of
the Valley road, the crowd in the big
building yelled itself hoarse. He accused
Bryan and the Democrats of shaking the
credit of the country, and said that the
people of this country were refraining
trom engaging in business enterprises
until after November 3, owing to the stand
taken by the Democrats.

SANTA CLARANS BUNKOED
"Electric Bill" Sells Many
Worthless Belts at Fancy
Prices.
After Fleecing a Crowd on the Street
He Narrowly Escapes Mob
Violence.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 15.â A traveling
medicine faker, with the sobriquet of
"Electric Bill," did a good business in
Santa Clara last evening and victimized
several hundred people by selling a cheap
electric belt at a profit of about 1000 per
cent. Before "Electric Bill" began the
sale 'of his wares he threw a handful of
small silver among his audience and when
he offered his belts at $1 apiece there was
a mad rush for them. He then bought a
number of the belts back at several times
the price paid for them, and this caused
the more timid to invest. After he had
disposed of his entire stock he sang a song
entitled "Just Tell Them You Have Met
Me and They Will Know the Rest." When
the faker went to his hotel he was pursued
by a howling mob of his victims, and for
a time it looked as though "Electric Bill"
would be dragged from the hotel and
made to refuud the money.
INVESTIGATING CHARGES.
Alleged Irregularities Among Members
of the Common Council.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 15.â The investi

Clara streets to appear before it next
Tuesday evening and give testimony as to
whether the charge that they paid $50 to
members of the Council is true or not.
Last evening testimony was taken in
Knapp's case, all of which showed Knapp
had done no work to earn the $12 drawn
from the city. Knapp will be prosecuted
for obtaining money under lalse pre
tenses. The committee will also investi
gate some assigned claims on which
money has been drawn from the city.

GREAT WORK BY
PALO ALTO'S HEAD
Dr. David Starr Jordan's
Book on American
. Fishes.
Consists of Three Massive Vol
umes and Cost Years
of Toil.
FIRST COPIES ARE JUST OUT.
The Doctor Assisted in the Vast Un
dertaking by an Eminent
Ichthyologist.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Gal.; Oct.
15. â The great work on fishe3-which has
occupied Dr. Jordan's attention for several
years, and is the greatest work of its kind
ever attempted, is just in print and Dr.
Jordan is in receipt of â  the ' first copies.
The work is entitled "Fishes of North and
Middle America," and was prepared by
Dr. David Starr Jordan of Stanford Uni
versity and Barton Warren Evermann,
Ph.D., ichthyologist of the United States
Fish Commission. The work was pub
lished by ; the Smithsonian Institution
National Museum, and consists of three
massive volumesâ the first alone number
ing 1240 pages of close printâ descriptions
of the various fish forms found in America
from Panama north. In brief form the
authors have brought together in carefuily
classified shape a description of the fish
like vertebrates found in all the waters of
North America.
The dedication is, "To the memory of
those ichthyologists of the past who have
studied American fishes in America, in
token of 'the only reward they askedâ a
grateful remembrance of their work.' "
Then follows , a list of these men from
George Marcgraf, 1610-1644. to Marshall
McDonald, 1836-1895. -â¢ â . â  - .â¢' â¢
In the preface of the work the authors
have the following to say
In scope the work includes all the species
known to exist in North America, Central
America, the West Indies, the Caribbean Sea,
the Galapagos Archipelago-, with the offshore
banks aud continental slopes o( both oceans
included, as well as the waters of the Gulf
Stream. All marine species known to occur
north of the equator, and all fresh-water spe
cies north of the Isthmus of Panama, are in
cluded. :
The classification and sequence of groups
adopted by us is essentially that of Dr. Theo
dore Gill, freely modified to suit our present
purposes. This system in many ot its details
is purely tentative, to be confirmed or changed
when the anatomy of the various forms is bet
ter known. ' â  ' '* -
The rules of nomenclature recently formu
lated by the American Ornithologists' Union,
and now adopted by nearly all American nat
uralists, have Deen. followed in this work.
. An effort has been mane to show in the se
quence of forms something of our knowledge
of the line of evolution of different groups of
fishes. >
Some idea of the vastness of the work
may be estimated when it requires nearly
fifty pages for toe table of contents of the
first part only. One hundred and for.ty
eight family groups of fishes are taken up,
composed of 522 genuses and 1027 sub
genuses.
Dr. Jordan cays that in the preparation
of the work he was busied directly for four
years, and indirectly for many years more.
Typewriting of descriptions alone has
cost Dr. Jordan over $1000, yet all he gets
for the work is fifty copies, which illus
trates the fact that as a rule scientific works
are far from a source of revenue to their
authors. The author further states that
the preparation of his notes and their
transcription on typewriters gave three
students employment for a year. It is
possible to obtain copies of the work
through the members of Congress or
through the secretary of the National
Museum.
INJURED FOOTBALL-PLAYERS.
Many of the Principal Men Are Aursing
Sprains and liruises.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
15.â Stanford Is just now wondering when
the epidemic of injuries to football-players
is to come to an end. About half the
regular Varsity men, several second-team
players and four of the freshmen eleven
are doctoring their sprains and bruises,
which are sufficiently serious in character
to keep them off the gridiron for several
days at a time. The fact that there should
be so many accidents in practice games is
rather peculiar, inasmuch as mass and
momentum plays were supposed to be
the sole cause of those" evils, and yet these
plays have been eliminated f ro:n the game.
The play of the men last night was fair
considering the fact that so many new
men v;ere playing on both teams in place
of those who are recuperating. Tho
second eleven played a strong game. C.
Thomas made a good showing at tackle,
and ia evidently making a strong fight for
that position on the Varsity. The inter
ference was better than it hÂ»s been for
some time, Mclntosh getting in re
peatedly and assisting the runner for good
gains.
Coach Cross went hunting quail to-day,
leaving yesterday afternoon for the
grounds. He returned to-day, having had
very poor luck and with an infinitesimal
respect for that inaccessible section that
the California bird loves best. Cross is
very fond of shooting and is planning for
a duck hunt in the near future.

PETALUMA, Cal., Oct. 15.â The
Women's Christian Temperance Union
State Convention received a visit to-day

fully bruised about the face, but not seri
cusly hurt.
It was decided to set apart the day be
fore election and the Saturday before elec
tion for fasting and prayer and the day
after election for thanksg'vinp. Ministers
of the State afe invited to preach on the
suffrage question the day before election.
Four young children were consecrated
to the temperance cause before the con
vention, and several interesting papers
were read. It is the intention of the
Women's Christian Temperance Union to
follow up the carrying of numerous sixth
amendment petitions to Sacramento by a
vigorous legislative campaign until the
amendment is declared adopted.
To-night the exercises consisied of the

HAHN'S DEATH ON THE DESERT.
Evidence That He Was Unbalanced and
Perished in Great Agony.
BAKERSFiELD, Cal., Oct. 15.â From
subsequent developments in the Habn
case it appears that he should not have
been allowed abroad without a guardian.
The last known of him definitely was on
Tuesday, October 6, when he appeared at
the McDonald ranch, over fifty miles from
Asphalto, where he hired a horse to take
him to the railroad station at the place
named. He started out on horseback, but
after two or three hours returned and said
he could not manage the animal and
would walk. He then left his coat and
some money at the ranch to await his re
turn and started out on foot with only a
small bottle of water and no food. The
road he was to traverse was unsettled and
there is a stretch of over fifty miles with
out water. Only a greenhorn would have
tried to make the journey equipped as he
was, and the natural result lollowed. He
must have wandered fully two days with
out food or water, got off the road and
then got back again, where he died. That
he perished in agony is shown by the fact
that he had torn up the ground with his
hands for tome space arouud the spot
where his body lay.
SANTA CRUZ'S LIBEL SUIT
Evidence Concluded in a Case
Involving the CouEty
Printing.
Defendant Braun Admits Being a
Party to a Conspiracy to
Defraud
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Oct. 10.-The evi
dence in the criminal libel suit in the
Superior Court against Ed Braun, editor
of the Evening Record, was finished this
afternoon. Arguments will be heard to
monow. On cross-examination by Dis
trict Attorney Carl E. Lindsay defendant
admitted that there was a combination
formed to defraud the county out of ad
vertising funds; that every paper in this
city, with the exception of the Penny
Press, and nearly every paper in the
county was a party to the scheme; that it
was agreed last year by them to have the
Sentinel get the contract for printing the
delinquent tax-list at a "fat" price and
then divide the spoils among them; that
in order to have the Sentinel awarded the
contract it was agreed that no paper
should underbid its exorbitant rate, and
that one paper should overbid it, inas
much as two bids were called for by law,
and that the Record was selected as the
fittest paper to make the false bid over the
Sentinel.
When asked by the District Attorney
why he gave his higher bid into Waldron's
care to submit with the Sentinel's bid,
since he knew the Sentinel would get the
contract, he answered that he was to have
a share of the overcharge.
Braun's evidence was in direct conflict
with tlae statements he made on direct ex
amination yesterday. He said then that
he knew of no combination to overcharge
the county for printing and had no part in
any such combination. The expose made
by the Penny Press last May of this com
bine was the cause of Braun's attack in
the Evening Record upon Phil Francis,
then editor and proprietor of the Penny
Press, and this attack was the basis of the
charge by Francis against Braun of crim
inal libel.

FIRES STILL RAGE
ABOUT PASADENA
Great Peril of Men Who
Are Fighting the
Flames.
Their Blankets and Provisions
Consumed and Themselves
Hemmed In.
VALUABLE PRCPEETY IS SAVED
But the Timber Loss Is Enormous
and Rain Alone Can Bring
Entire Relief.
PASADENA, Cal., Oct. 15.â Mountain
fires are still raping fiercely. Men who
came down to-day for supplies report
great dangers and hardships encountered.
They had no sleep for forty-eight hoars,
and part of their supplies were destroyed,
and for twenty-four hours they had sub
sisted only on coffee. Fire cut them off
from their blankets and provisions, which
were abandoned to the flames. To escape
with their lives the men scaled precipitous
peaks, and slid down mountain sides
through brush. By back-firing and cut
ting wide paths in undergrowths they cut
off the fire in several directions, thus pro
tecting all valuable property, including
the Alpine Tavern, Mount Lowe improve
ments* and the Los Cusitas Sanitarium,
which was at one time threatened. The
burnt-over ground is deep with ashes, and
all the timber on the southern side of the
mountains is almost destroyed, still the
fires burn with terrific force, illuminating
the heavens, and appearing like a huge
fiery furnace. The spectacle is grand, awe
inspiring and terrible. No such experi
ence has been known in years, and there
is small hope of entire relief except from
rain. Fire-fighting is bains concentrated
on Negro Canyon, and men are patrolling
the burnt districts to keep the fire from
spreading. The men employed by the
Lak6 Vineyard Water Company for fight
ing the fires were paid off to-day, the pay
roll amounting to over $1000. While the
fire appears worse to-night than at any
other time, there is less danger to im
proved property than during the past sev
eral days.
INCENDIARISM AT MADERA.
James Hunt, a Xoung Man From
Tulare, in Jail on Suspicion.
MADERA, Cal., Oct. 15.â Last night
the barn of J. S. Osborne ' was burned to
the ground under such circumstances
as to arouse the suspicion of the
officers that an incendiary had been at
work. Immediately an investigation was
set on foot with a view to ascertaining
who the guilty party was, with the result
that a young man named James Hunt,
who had come from Tulare yesterday,
was arrested and placed in jail on sus
picion. Last night Hunt, instead of stay
ins at the hotel, as was his usual custom,
camped on the outskirts of town. This
morning his horse was covered with per
spiration and showed evidence of a bard
ride during the night, which Hunt ex
plained Dy saying that he was chasing one
of his horses during the night. This
statement was proven to be lalse, and,
upon the suggestion of the District At
torney, Hunt was placed in jail to await
his preliminary examination, which will
be held at an early date. Hunt was for a
long time in the employ of Osborne.
BIG FIRE NEAR GUERNEVILLE,
Korbel Bros.' Wlntnr Itatnaged to the
Extent of $40,000.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. 14.â Forty
thousand dollars is the estimated loss
caused by a big fire at the Korbel Bros.'
winery near Guerneville last night. The
fire was caused by the exploding of two
16,000-gallon fermenting tanks in which
was stored pomace. The fire raged fiercely
for three hours. The tanks were on the
third floor of the winery and the flames
shot a hundred feet in the air. The nre
was finally subdued by knocKing to pieces
the other big fermenting tanks filied with.
this year's vintage and allowing the wine
to flood the building. The loss is esti
mated at about $40,000, in addition to
which a large press was destroyed and
150,C00galloiis of wine lost. The winery
is insured for $50,000 and is one of the
biggest in the country. The building Co3t
$145,0Q0, and the machinery, cooperage
and stock are valued at $60,000.

RALLY IN FORCE
A Gala Night of Greeting
to Distinguished
Gentlemen.
Talks by Ex-Senator Felton, Con
gressman Loud and Hon.
T. B. O'Brien.
THE DANGER TO THE NATIOK
Mr. Loud Called Attention to the Safety
of the People's Moaey Now
in the Banks. ,
The meeting of the Phoenix Republican
Club in Scottish Hall last night was an
affair more than ordinarily enjoyable.
Sylvester Shaben presided, introducing
such distinguished gentlemen as ex-Sena
tor Felton, Congressman Loud and Thomas
B. O'Brien.
Messrs. Loud and O'Brien and Judge H.
L. Joachimsen occupied the platform.
Charles Ward enlivened the occasion
with a piano solo. Before he had finished
the proceedings were interrupted by the
d entrance of the Thirty- first and Twenty
third District Republican clubs, with fife
and drum and transparencies, the mem
bers carrying American flags. Their ar
rival was greeted with enthusiastic cheers,
and cheers were proposed ana given for
Candidates Sullivan and Welch for the
Senate, and for Congressman Loud. Hon.
T. B. O'Brien and Judges Treadwell and
Joachimsen, and George W. Elder, candi
date for Street Superintendent'
Messrs. Gallagher ana Barrett sang a
comic song laudatory of the Republican
candidates, which was encored, and in re
sponse they sang "Ryan and O'Brien."
Congressman Loud was introduced by
Chairman Shaben with a lew well-timed
and eulogistic phrases. Mr. Loud began
by saying that the Phoenix Club had been
heard of and its influence had been felt by .
the whole State. He complimented the
young Republicans of the club for their
loyalty and enthusiasm in the cause.
When at the outset of the campaign he
had been told that very many, had left the
ranks of the Republican party, and when
he asked where they were, and the reply
was given that they were not in the City,
but somewhere back of the hills, from that
day to this he had keen going larthcr and
farther along in search of those Repub
licans who were said to have left the
ranks, but he had not succeeded in finding
them.
He then proceeded to speak on the sub
ject of the demonetization of silver, and
remarked that it was a strange coinci
dence that for nineteen years a.ter
the passage of that act the coun
â¢ try had enjoyed a prosperty never be
fore known in its history, anci that twenty
three years afterward, just when the Dem
ocracy was giing out of power, it should
be nfscovered that the demonetization of
silver was responsible for the present
distress under the operation of the Wilson
act.
Mr. Loud denied that this Nation ever
was on a bimetallic basis, and contended
\that as soon as there was a deviation of
even the fraction of a cent in the value of j
one of the metals the parity would cease
Rnd one of the metalÃ would dissapep.r
from circulation. He asserted also that
the opening of the minis to the free coin
age of the silver of the world would cut
the circulation in ha'f by driving every
dollar of gold out of the country.
The speaker said that he was not an
alarmist, but he would predict ihat as
soon as the Democratic party gets into
pow<-r, if that time should ever come,
every business institution in the Nation
would be closed. Take out of circulation
the $600,000,000 of gold upon which rests
its paper money and its silver and every
bank in the United States would close
within twenty-iour hours. He had heard
people damn the bank.Â« and the batiKers,
but they did not reflect that 146.000 people
in the State of California had $144,000,000
in the banks of this State, and those
people were entitled to every dollar of
those deposits in as good money as they
put in.
Mr. Loud impressed upon the minds of
his hearers the necessity of electing a Re
publican to the United States Senate. As
matters now stood there was a PopullÃtic-
Demoeratic free-silver henate, and the loss
of California from the Rtpbulican ranks
woula be a serious calamity to the people
of this Union.
The fate ol the leaders ol the French i
revolution whose heads rolled under the |
guillotine at the whim of the mob which
they had placed in power was recalled by
Mr. Loud, who njade their fate appiy to
the demagogues of the Democratic and
People's parties.
After Mr. Loud's address Messrs. Galla
gher and Barrett favored the audience
with a song and an Irish jig.
Ex-Senator Charles L. Felton was the
next speaker. He told about; his first
meeting with Congressman Loud five or
six years ago. He saw at once that Mr.
L>ud had that rare quality, the courage of
his convictions, an>i that he was one of
those men who, when they found what
was the right, had the nerve to proclaim
it and stand up for it. Because of Mr.
Loud's ability and the impression he had
k. made upon the other members of Con
gress he had been appointed chairman of
the second most important committee in
Congress.
Mr. Felton advised the people to return
Mr. Loud to Congress and they would
have a representative of wiiom they need
not feel ashamed. He himself wanted to
feel when he visited the National Capitol
ihat it would not be necessary to bow his
head in humiliation because of the in
efficiency of some representatives whom
this people had sent to Congress.
Mr. Felton explained that his ambition
was satisfied and that he was not seeking
any office. All that he wanted was the
prosperity of the country and the 'lappi
ness of the American people. He believed
that thve was nothing so lorcible as
truth, nothing so wise as common hon
esty.
Thomas B. O'Brien, the next speaker,
was received with a round of the most
flattering applause. He complimented
the majority of his hearers on being
American-born boys, the most of them
being native sons of the Golden West.
He spoke of his ambition to represent the
Fourth District in Congress, a district
which he said was being misrepresented
by the incumbent, who was an idolater of
the foreign English policy of free trade.
He asked which policy was it that had
made this Nation the grandest that the
sun ever shone upon, the Republican pol
icy of protection or the Democratic policy
of free trade? He remembered the hu
miliating spectacle of the Industrial army
two years ago walking the streets poorly
clad and starving. Six years ago in this
City 37.000 people were employed in
(eighty-nine industries; to-day there are
only 16,000 people employed in this City.
The annual output six years ago of San
Francisco was $120 000,000, and it has
dwindled down to $47,000,000.
This deplorable state of affairs, the
speaker contended, had been brought
about by the destructive Democratic policy
of a tariff for revenue only. His Demo
cratic opponent had aaid on the floor of
ConÃresÃ that if he had his way every
custom-house in the country would be
converted into a sanitarium for sailors.
Yet those same enstom-houses had col
lected $141,000,000 of revenue during the
past four years. He did not believe that
the people of the district were prepared to
indorse the policy of Cobdenism, but If
sent to Congress he wcmlil be almost a
prohibitionist in keeping out foreign prod
ucts.
Attention was called to the fact that
there was not in the Democratic platform
one word on the sut>KCt of the Nicaragua
canal, while the Republican platform
pledged all its nominees to the completion
of that enterprise.
The threatened invasion by Japanese
laborers was the next subject taken up by
the speaker
Mr. O'Brien was warmly applauded
during his remarks. He was followed in
brie.' speeches by Chairman Shaben. M. J.
Welch (candidate for the Senate lrom the
Twenty-third District) ami T. J. Sullivan
(Senatorial candidate from the Thirty
nrst District).
The meeting adjourned with cheers for
the ticket and McKinley.

MR. DIMOND ON MB. FHELAN.
Compliments From One Democrat to
Another â Anti-Charter Meeting
at the Temple.
A rousing meeting of enthusiastic Anti-
Charter Democrats was held at Metropol
itan Temple last night.
W. G. Burke, Anti-charter Democratic
nominee for Judge of the Superior Court,
called the meeting to order, with what a
football reporter would call a "snappy
play," for he at once declared that the
people had come together for the purpose
ot denouncing the proposed new charter
of San Francisco, as not only un-Demo
cratlc, out also un-American. "1 have the
honor of presenting to you a champion of
the people, the Hon. Patrick Reddy," said
Mr. Burke, and Mr. Reddy received an en
thusiastic round of applause as he stepped
to the front of the rontrum.
Mr. Reddy said he appeared from a
sense of duty, for he, as well as the other
gentlemen who stood on that platform the
evening previous, had a desire to serve
the City of San Francisco. He said that
it would be a matter of physical impossi
bility to point out all the wrongful,
vicious and monstrous provisions of the
proposed charter.
One point that Mr. Reddy wished to
notice first, and that was a suggestion
made by Mr. Clement in the newspapers,
which was to the effect that tne tendency
of modern times is to concentrate power.
This Mr. Reddy denied.
He said that that idea of centralization
of power is as oid as the absolute mon
archies of the past, under which so many
wrongs were perpetrated. The modern
tendency is for a true democracy, a true
republican form of government. Mr.
Reddy said:
But we have been informed that Mr. Phelan,
the geutleman who aspires to be chosen Mayor
on the other ticket, has been abroad where he
has stuaied the methods of municipal govern
ments that oDtain in Europe in order to put
them is force here. In reply to that 1 say
thatthisis America and we need American,
not European methods here. [Applause.]
. Other people have beeu in Europe.
[Laughter.] 1 doubt not the gentleman's
parents were in Europe at some time in their
lives. [Renewed laughter.] My parents lived
in Europe themse.ves, but they got Â»o poor
thai they had to come to this country, just as
1 have heard that the parents of Mr. Phelan
came here, and lrom all accounts they have
done pretty well. [Laughter and applause.]
Why, if reports be true, they got rich eveu
under the bad old consolidation act, and from
all we hear that weaitu is still increasing.
It is of record that Mr. Phelan, when elected
to the National convention on a silver plat
form, gave his proxy to n.n avowed goldbug.
who voted gold, gold, gold, morning, noon
aii<l night, without receiving any reproof from
Mr. Pheian.
That's why I say that I thlak Mr. Phelan
looks like a goldbug crawling across a silver
platter.
Mr. Reddy said the teachers had called
I Mr. Phelan's attention to that obnoxious
! clause concerning them, and then all at
once Mr. Phelan and his lawyer discov
ered .that this clause is unconstitutional.
i But if the charter be adopted ;he teachers
! will be confronted with that provision.
In conclusion permit to state that the Young
Men's Christian Association stands as a po*i
i tive force for complete manhood, both in body
i and heart. It is one of the great moral forces
at work reclaiming the manhood in the youth
! of the world.
But he said that this was not the worst
; danger ttuit confronts the teachers; that,
; as a matter of fact, all of the teacht-rs in
the public schools on the adoption of the
charter will lose their places, and that if
they want to get back they must apply to
j the boards and beads of departments that
are to be appointed by the Mayor. Id
I fact, every City and County ollirer now
in office, or who may be in office at the
time of the adoption of the charter, will
be thrown out In proof of this he read
i section 26 of article XIV of the proposed
charter. If teachers want to serve in our
public schools they must all stand com
petitive examination, and unless they
were educated exclusively under tne pub
lic school system of California they cannot
be granted certificates, no matter how
high i their qualifications. This provision,
| he said, was inserted at the behest of the
! A. P. A.
The teachers and others have been de
j ceived by the promise of the inauguration
j of the civil service plan in the municipal
j service. That civil service rule will appiy
i only to those who are to be appointed by
I the Mayor and his appointees, lor all now
| in the employ of the City will go out.
Mr. Reddy said be knew the risk he was
running if this view of the law is not true,
but he measured his words and believed
that he was corrsct in this interpretation.
Ho said the Mayor would be the only oi
licer elected. The others would be ap
pointed.
Mr. Reddy made sport of the fright that
s/emed to have seized on Mr. Phelan
whpn he thought of the danger o* a nomi
nation by the "Blind White Devil," with
which at one time ne seemed to be
threatened.
The speaker said that if the charter be
adopted the Supervisors may prohibit any
kind of processions, whether legal or oth
wise. Then if people get poor and seek to
ritht their wrongs by public demonstra
tions they may be prohibited from annoy
ing the Piielans and other rich men by
their outcries.
"It will never get there!" "We'll knock
it out !" "It's a gone goose !" and such ex
pressions were shouted from parts of the
hall.
Mr. Reddy denounced the synopsis
which has been put forth by the friends of
the charter. He said it is a lying synop
sis ; that it is false and fraudulent in many
particulars.
Joseph I. Dimond, nominee for Mayor
j on the Anti-Charter Democratic ticket was
introduced and his popularity was at
tested by the spontaneous reception of the
audience. It was some time before the
applause subsided so that he could pro
ceed. He said :
I will not make you a speech to-night, but
will simply report the result of the day's work
in the tield. 1 have been out amo:ig the p->o
plÂ«âthe common, every-day peopleâ for the
pa-it ten hours. I have traveled from the Po
trero to Lone Mountain, from the Mission to
the bay. and everywhere 1 have found that the
real manhood of the City has been aroused in
opposition to the charter.
The men wbo work are alive to the threat
ened invasion of their rights. They will kill
this infernal document. [Cheers and applause,
with cries of "You bet we will."]
Whatever view you may lake of the candi
dacy of any man on our ticket or any other,
thai is a matter of miuor consideration so long
as you set the neal of condemnation on that
document. [Applause and cries of "We'll
stand by you, old man!"]
The gentleman who has proclaimed himself
as my opponent, though I regard him more as
the opponent of the interests of this fair City
made a speech in this hail last night, and m
reading a report of It I was surprised to notice
that it was so mild, not to say weak. [Laugh
ter.]
About the only point on which he seemed to
lay any stress was that he had been assured
that the clause relating to school teachers is
unconstitutional and that if he did not believe
it to be unconstitutional he would vote
aeainet the charter himself.
Now in all frankness let me ask you and the
other fair-minded voters of Pan Francisco
what is to be thought of a man who will ad
vise his fellow-citizens to goto the polls on
the 3d of next month and vote for a cbarter
which he himself declares is iv violation of
the constitution of the State of California.
[Laughter.] Do you think he would be a sate
man to manage our municipal affairs, either
under the new charter or the poor old consol
idation act? [Applause and cries of "No I"
"No!"]
Then, do you have any Idea that he will be
chosen by the good people of San Francisco to
serve as Mayor for the(uext two years? [More
applause and cries of "Not mucnl 1 ' "He isn't
in ii I" etc.]
Just as the cheering was about to sub
side a man standing on a seat in the rear
of the hall roared out "Nit l" and amid
the universal roar of the audience Mr.
Dimond waved his hand majestically to
the people and took his seat.
The meeting adjourned with a vote of
thanks to Mr. Reddy and three cheers for
Mr. Dimond.
PHELAN AND THE CHARTER
He Says He Has Favored It Openly and
That He Favors It Still.
James D. Phelan spoke at a meeting in
Mowry's Hall last evening, following re
marks by Dr. Rasan and National Corn
mitteeman Dwyer. Mr. Phelan said that
he advocated the adoption of the proposed
new charter before he was nominated for
Mayor, and that he was still quietly in
favor of it, but could not openly favor
it because it would seem as if he
was seeking more power as Mayor in case
he should be elected. He did not know
but that he was saying too much, but he
did not want any one to be deceived con
cerning his position in this matter. He
also said that there was but one Demo
cratic party in this City and the other
wing was only a nondescript.
There were several other speakers, the
first of whom was Joseph P. Kelly, can
didate for Congres*. The meeting took on
the form of a Democratic ratification
meeting. ______________
YOUNG MEN IN COUNCIL,
The Sixteenth Annual State
Convention of the
Y. M. C. A.
The S ssion Opened Last Evening
at the Association Audi
torium.
Delegates to the sixteenth annual State
Convention of the Young Men's Christian
Association of California arrived in large
numbers yesterday afternoon and an in
formal reception wa3 held in the spacious
parlors of the new home of the association
at 6 o'clock. Mr. McCoy, assisted by a
large corps of young men from the local
association, received the guests and at 6:30
o'clock all sat down to a repast in the din
ing-hall onÂ«the fifth floor of the building.
After ample justice had been done to the
edibles about an hour was indulged in
reminiscences of past association days, re
marks were make by visiting delegates,
local clergymen and officers of the San
Francisco association.
Promptly at 8 o'clock all repaired to the
handsome auditorium of the building,
where numerous friends were in waiting
for the delegates proper, seats being re
served in the center of the hall for the
representatives of associations out of the
City. After a brief praise service, H. J.
McCoy, general secretary of the local as
sociation and president of the State Asso
ciation for the past year, called the con
vention to order. After some preliminary
business, Rev. Charles R. Brown, the new
pastor of the First Congregational Church
of Oakland, was introduced, and delivered
an address. In part he spoke as follows:
As a rule the work of young men is monoto
nous. They are simply a part of a great ma
chine. They do not mflke a shoe, but only a
part of It. If they work in a large store it is
not to sell all that the store carries, but some
special articles as suspenders or neckties. So
you see that the young man of the present
day is only a cog in the wheel. Bis chance to
rise is very uncertain.
In social life he has very small chance to get
into the society of those whose culture will be
a benefit. I mean by this, not that he cannot
find companions of good principles, but that
his vocation deprives him of such company in
general as will tend to lift him to a higher
mental, and, in some cases, moral .sphere.
The young man of whom I have bi en dis
coursing is he who is city bred, and that fact
leads me to mention his facilities for going
wrong. In the country a young man is geii
erally held pretty well in the course of recti
tude by the force of public opiniou. He is
known by everybody. But in a large city he is
not fo well known, and can do wrong without
many, perhaps, being aware of It. The tempta
tions are vastly stronger.
To these baneful influences the Young Men's
Christian Association is an offset. It gives him
employment in his leisure hours, both men
tally and physically. His mind is enriched
with the kind of knowledge that will give him
higher ideals. His muscles, imperfectly de
veloped by one kind of work, are made sym
metrical by proper gymnastic appliances.
The young man of the present day is lament
ably ignorant as regards questious of political
economy. How many oi them have even an
elementary understanding of the currency
question, lor example ? ln this particular of
late the association has done much work.
Debates have been alternated with addresses
l>y learned lecturers and much good has re
sulted.
The following programme will be the or
der for the next three days:

time is constantly occupied in this exten
sive branch of association effort. There

tian associations in the colleges as there

nection with all the colleges and universi
ties of the country.

MR, BOUTELLE
WILL COME HERE
The Statesman From Maine
to Speak in Cali
fornia. â¢
One of the Most Noted Authori
ties on the Financial
Issue.
REED OF MAINE MAT COME.
Good Work by the Republican State
Central Committee â Literature in
All Tcngues.
The Republican State Central Commit
tee has secured the services of Congress
man Boutelle of Maine for several speeches
in this State during the present campaign.
Mr. Boutelle will speak in the Auditorium
Tuesday night, corner of Jones and Eddy
streets, under the auspices of the commit
tee.
The standing rule of going there early
in order to be assured of standing-room
will, on this occasion, be more imperative
than ever. Ladies and their escorts will
have access to the galleries as usual.
Congressman Boutelle is a prominent
figure in National politics, ana as an au
tnority on finance stands second only to
John Sherman, but he will be remembered
best by his course in Congress with refer
ence to Hawaiian affairs.
He will speak in Sacramento on Wednes- |
day and in Los Angeles on Saturday of j
next week.
Mnjor McLaughlin, chairman, and M.
R. Higgins, secre'ary, of the Republican
State Central Committee, have been in
correspondence for several weeks past j
with Thomas B. Reed of Maine with the
view of having him speak in California.
A telegram was received from Mr. Reed
yesterday morning to the effect that he
was uncertain whether he could come or
not, but that he would give a definite an
swer to the commit tee in a day or two.
The committee is more rushea with
work than ever. There are no cobwebs in
the State Central Committee's headquar- |
ters in the Palace Hotel. Several stenog- j
rapbers and typewriters are kept busy j
every day in replying to the voluminous j
mass of correspondence handled by the j
committee. In the entresol on the floor j
below a large force of clerks is working j
full time in mailing campaign literature.
It is surprising to learn what a great
inquiry there is from all parts of the Slate
for this literature. The favorites seem to
be the speech of Hon. W. Bourke Cockran
at Madison-square garden in reply to Mr.
Bryan's Casabianca speech; the speech of
John Sherman on August 15, 1896, on the |
monetary history of the coiÂ«ntiy; Major I
McKmley : s letter of acceptance; speech
of John G. Carlisle before the workingmen !
of Chicago August 15, 1896; J. T. Me- j
Cleary of Minnesota on silver and gold, I
wages and prices; speech of James Q. j
Blame of Maine in tne Senate of the
United State 3 February 7, 1878, against
free coinage at 16 to 1; an article from
Street Railway Review August, 1896. en
titled "What Free Coinage of Silver Means
to Street Railways and Street- railway Em
ployes," and several other selections bear
ing upon the financial and protection
issues.
Most of the speeches have been trans
lated into a hall dozen modern languages,
and there are several pamphlets on special
topics addressed to naturalized citizens
and printed in the languages of the coun
tries from which they hail. Among some
of the titles are: "Bryan Contro Gli Itali
ani," "O Motivo Porque Os Portugnezes
Devem Votar Por McKinley," besides
other brochures in French, Spanish, Ger
man, Scandinavian and Slavonian.
The majority of the inquirers ask for
pamphlets on protection, and this fact Is
regarded as a good omen as indicating
that the people in the interior have re
covered from the glamour of free silver and
are seeking for Jight on an issue that
directly affects them.
Enthusiastic Republicans from the
country pay a visit to the State Central
Committee rooms before they go any
where else to report the change in senti
ment that has taken place since the open
ing of the campaign, and which is now
continuing in intensity. They tell also of
the large number of old-line Democrats
who have come out from under the an
archistic Chicago platform, and who say
they propose to vote for McKinley and
protection.
Major McLaughlin and Colonel Higgins
are worked like drayhorses, and they <fb
not receive a dollar's remuneration for it,
but they feel cheered and forget their fa
tigue when they hear the nattering reports
of Republican gains coming from all parts
of the State in person and by letter.
Registrar Hinton rested in peace yes
terday after the arduous work of the
past few weeks. All the tickets had been
filed on the day before, and no protests
had come before him yesterday, so that
he was happy. No "name, even to fill a
vacancy, can be put on the ballot now, and
no candidate cau withdraw after the 19tb,
next Monday.
NON-PARTISAN FINANCES.
Nominees Determine to Pay fop
Publishing Their Ticket.
The Non-Partisans are in straits over
the all- important matter of finances to
conduct the campaign in favor of the men
they recently v placed in nomination for
municipal offices. How fo get the nomi
nees to contribute without in any. way
conflicting with the purity-of-election law
is a question that was considered at a
meeting held last evening. J. D. Pheian
presided at this gathering of candidates.
The chairman announced that the
scheme devised was to raiae contributions
among the nominees to meet the expenses
of publishing the Non- Partisan ticket in
the daily papers and to send out 70,000
copies of the ticket to voters. It was de
cided not to hold any public meetings.
After a recess of fifteen minutes the
various candidates reported to the chair
man what they could each contribute and
still keep within the purity law. All con
tributions are to be paid to the treasurer,
E. J. Le Breton of the French Bank, by
Monday next.
The action was wholly voluntary on
the part of the candidates, the campaign
committee of the Non-Partisans declaring
it would not accept a cent from them it
there was any way to get on without it
The action taken was entirely in the in
terest of the candidates.
Bryan Stiver Meeting.
The Bryan silver meeting under the
auspices of the University of California
and affiliated colleges will be held at Met
ropolitan Hall on Saturday evening. Gov
ernor James H. Kudd is to be the orator
of the occasion. There will also be short
addresses by S. P. Elias and A. B. Mor
gan of Stanford University, H. E. Church
of the Hastings Law College and H. T.
Nutter of the California University. The
University Quartet and the Stanford Man
dolin Club will furnish music.
O'Donnell for Mayor.

intention to run as an independent candi

WILLIAM HcKINLEY, of Ohio
FOX TICK-PRESIDENT-
GARRET A. BOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
The local Populist ratification meeting
was a good enough function, but wnat did
it ratify?
Wheat and silver have parted company
just in t me to keep step with the farmers
who have parted company with the sil
verites.
The fieht against Bryan is virtually
over, and now we must push the fight
against I.ryunite Congressmen, wilh vim
and vigor.
One Palmer and Buckner man has
spoken up with an estimate of the vote in
November. He declares his ticket will
carry Alabama.
Whenever Bryan talks of sweeping tbe
big corporations from this country you
may be sure he always puts the silver
trust on a mental reservation.
The National Democrats are developing
an unexpected strengt i in the South, and
it seems now that Bryan cannot ciaim a
sure thing in any State in the Union.
As Robert Insersoll and Robert Lincoln
are to foliow Bryan's trail through Min
nesota the boy orator has a double reason
tor rejoicing that he is out of tbe State.
With such a muscular mass of tongue
and j;iw Bryan, if he had avoided politics,
would have had a chance to make himself
the greatest professional pugilist of the
age.
Making a pledge to a convention and
then modifying it afterward to suit the
bosses is the latest trick in politics, and it
is scarcely necessary to say it is a Demo
cratic invention.
The revenue of the Nation must ba
made eaual to the expenditures, and that
is one reason why the people will vote
against the fiasco party that enacted a
National deficit.
If the Republican party should be
divided on election day the success of
either Buckley or Rainey would be assured
and municipal reform would be retarded
for a long time to come.
The more Bryan talks about tbe strife
of classes and the war of the poor against
the rich the more the people are per
suaded that the chief issue before the
country is to shut him up.
The trade w- ich gives Cator the senator
ship and Buckley the municipal govern
ment may suit some Democrats and some
Populists, but it will never suit any who
believe in party principles or good govern
ment.
Tom Reed's visit to Caliiornia will be
more like a triumphal tour than a s'ump
speaKing trip. Men of all parties will
unite in doing honor to the great Speaker
who taught the House of Representatives
how to stop wrangling and do business.
There are increasing evidences that the
Silventes will make every eftort to control
tae next Senate so as to block the possi
bility of restoring the protective tariff.
That scheme must be stopped, and Cali
fornia must maks certain the election of a
Republican to the Senate by electing a
Republican Legislature.
If there are to be Non-Partisan legis
lators there ought to be a Non-Partisan
candidate for the United States Senate
who would pledge himself to dodge the
tariff, straddle the money question, com
promise on tbe funding bill and do noth
ing decidedly except draw his salary. Per
haps Mr. Cator woujd fill the bill.
According to political experts the hard
est fipht of the year will be for the control
of the Senate. Neither party will have
much of a majority in that body and every
vote will count. Californians cannot af
ford to take any risks on thai issue. We
must elect a Republican to the Senate if
we expect protection to our industries.
The September circular of Justice, Bate
man & Co. says: "It is not strange that
tbe wool sales during tbe past month
have been tbe dullest on recotd when it
is remembered that 75 percent of the wool
manufacturing machinery of the United
Sates either is entirely idle or is running
OB short time." I; was not that way
when the McKinley tariff was in force
and tbe wool industry was protected.
The visit of nearly 3uO members of the
Early Settlers' Society of Cuyahoga
County, Ohio, to Major McKinley is one
of tbe notable political events of the week,
as it shows the interest which tbe old men
of the country are takint in tbe campaign
for National prosperity. These veterans
in life remember the great contest of 1860,
and now, as tuen, they see that tbe salva
tion of the Republic depends on the suc
cess oi tbe Republican party.
SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.
Among the planks of tbe Republican
National platform which must not be
overlooked during tbe campaign is tÂ»iat
which declares the policy of the Republi
can party in regard to the veterans of tbe
war lor the Union. These men, as the
platform declares, "should receive fair
treatment and jtenerous recognition.
Wherever practicable ibey should be given
the preference in the matter of employ
ment, and they are entitled to tbe enact
ment of such laws as are best calculated to
j secure tbe iulfillment of the pledges made
I to them in tbe dark days of tbe country's
j peri!."
The platform jnstly denounces fhe prac
j tice of the Pension Bureau bo recklessly
j and unjustly carried on by tbe present ad-
I ministration of reducing pensions and
arbitrarily droppinc names from the roll
as justly deserving the severest condem
nation of the American people.
In his letter of acceptance Mr. McKin-
I ley gave tbe most cordial support and in
dorsement to this plank of the platform,
declaring th;it under his administration,
if elected, the soldiers and sailors of the
Union should neither be neglected nor
forgotten. Our soldiers and sailors, as he
say?, j?ave the best they had. "They
freely offered health, strength, limb and
life to save the country in tbe time of its
greatest peril, and the Government must
honor them in their need as in their ser
vice vrith the respect and gratitude due to
brave, noble and self-sacrificing men who
are justly entitled to generous aid in their
increasing necessities.''
The Republican partly rightly chal
lenges the Brvanites for their refnsal to
declare themselves in favor of a just
treatment of the defenders of the Union
who now, in their old age, not only de
serve but need the honorable recognition
of their services by the Government.
If Mr. Bryan does not favor the Clove
land policy he should at least say so. He
has not hesitated to denounce Mr. Cleve
land for issuing bonds in time of peace
and for his dealings with financial *-yndi
caes and there can, therefore, be no
icason why be should not be equally
ready to denounce him for his bad treat
ment of Union veterans.
Th"re may have been abuses and frauds
in the pension service. Where such
exist they should undoubtedly be reme
died and those who have perpetrated
them should be punist.ed; Dut no
soldier of the war should be made to
suffer for the wrong of another. The
debt wnich the Nation owes to the
soldiers and sailor^ of the Union armies
can never be fully repaid, but so far as
payment can be made it should be done
with tbe most loyal patriotism and to the
fullest extent.
The effect of the Chicago platform
upon the business world ha* been char
acterized not by Kepubllcans alone but
by the old and trusted leaders of the
Democratic party as a menace to every
vested interest in the United states,
revolutionary in character and directly
leading to dishonor and partial repudia
tion.âWilliam McKinley.
PROSPEORS IN THE SOUTH.
One of the best features in the campaign
is the earnest fight that is Leing made by
the Republicans of the Southern States.
For many years past the South has been
regarded as solidly Democratic, and little
or no effort has been made to carry any of
the States of that section for Republican'
candidates. A very different condition of
affairs prevails now. A strong fight will
be made tor McKitiley in every Southern
State, and there are good chances of carry
ing some of them.
This favorable change from tbe former
condition of things is due largely to tbe
revolt of conservative Democrats from the
Chicago platform and to the personal pref
erence of many intelligent Southern men
to vote for McKinley rather than to risk
tbe chance of the election of a man like
Bryan. Back of this feeling of disgust
with the Chicago ticket there is, more
over, in Southern business circles a con
sciousness that the welfare of Southern
industries as well as those of the North
is dependent upon the protective system.
Many Southerners, therefore, are by no
means sorry to see the breaking up of
free-trade Democracy, and are willing to
give the Republican party in their Stfttes
all the help they can.
The Republican National Committee is
doing much to promote tbe good cause.
The management of the campaign in the
South has been intrusted to Senator Quay
oi Pennsylvania and noablerleader for the
purpose could be found in ail tbe Union.
Quay is peculiarly fitted for tbe conduct of
an aggressive campaign. He has achieved
more than one victory where it seemed he
was simply leading a forlorn hope. His
management will inspire and encouraee
Republicans throughout the South and
there will be no lack of vim and vigor in
the fighting all along tbe line.
While Senator Qur.y intends to carry
the war aggressively into every Southern
State he will make his main attack in
West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and
Maryland. In each of these States there
is a fine prospect of success. The ranks
of the bourbons were broken in all of
them two years ago and have never since
been strongly formed. Victory in one or
more of tbem seems certain. It is indeed
full time the Solid South were broken up,
and what better time for such a breaking
tip could there be than this year which
has seen the disruption of the party which
kept it solid?
In the logic of events the silver craze
and its supporters will be brought into
derision and contempt. There is time
enough to reach that conclusion before
the November election. None is doi â  %
more to help in this than Bryan and
his supporters. As time goes on, under
the necessity of the case, all appear
ance of logical reasoning is disappear
ing from their speeches, end they are
becoming mere promoters of animosity
between classed, to the disgust of at
"very great number of persons who
might otherwise have been misled by
their specious fallacies.â Ed ward Atkin
son. -_-_-Â»-_______________
DODGING THEIR PLEDGES.
Two candidates for the State Senate and'
seven candidates for the Assembly, after
having received the nomination of the
Non-Partisan convention of this Cily on
an express and signed pledee to support
tbt new charter in the next Legislature,
have united in signing a documeut de
claring they will not keep that pledge
in the terms in which it was given. The
names of these men should be remem
bered. The candidates for tke Senate are
Samuel Braunhart and Hugo K. Asher;
(be candidates for the Assembly are Eu
gene F. Lacy, John Allen, Eugene J. Han
non, James P. Brady, John Power, George
B. Godfrey and William M. Gateiy, Dem
ocrats all.
At the time it was proposed that the
Non-Partisan convention should nom
inate candidates for the Legislature we
warned the members of that body of the
folly of such a course. A member of tbe
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALfc, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1896.
Legislature is necessarily a partisan. He
must vote on matters of public policy
which have become party measures. He
must, in the next Legislature, vote for the
election of a United 6tates Senator who
is to be a representative of one or tne
other of the great parties ol the Nation. A
non-pnrtlsan legislator, therefore, would
be ot necessity that rare creature known
as the "white blackbird." It seems that
in the cases of the gentlemen who have
signed this document the Non-Parti?ans
have indorsed or nominated rarer crea
tures still. Becking for the white birds
of reforjn, they have got them in the
color of the blackbirds of repudiated
pledges.
The issue raised between these Demo
crats, who after taking a pledge to vote
for the new charter if the same were car
ried by tbe vote of San Francisco, bave
now after what they call "mature consid
eration" decided to modify the pledge,
and the Non-Partisan convention may
well be left to them and the members of
that convention to settle between them
selves. The point for the people to note
is that these candidates did not give any
sign of modifying that pledge until it was
too lat" for the Non-Partisans to withdraw
the nominations and place other candi
dates in their places. Here is a clear case
of receiving a consideration and then
refusing to carry out the pledge for which
the consideration was given.
The men who have been thus false in
their written pledges are very likely to be
fa 1-e again in their spoken pledges to the
people. Who can trust men of this kind?
What is any promise of theirs worth? In
all the tricks and trades of this campaign,
and as between Democrats, Populists and
Non-Partisans it has been a campaign of
trades and dickers beyond parallel, there
has been nothing worse than this scheme
of Â«iv.ng pledges for a nomination and
then modifying them for the sake of elec
tion. It can be said for Mr. Braunhart and
the others that they have at least been
open in stating what they intend to do.
Others will not be so open and there will
be a good many more pledges broken if
the plediie-takers are elected to office. The
only safeguard of the people is to elect
men who stand for straight politics, and
who when they give pledges will stand by
them to the end.
If unfortunately the American people
should elect Sir. Bryan President no
tongue can describe the future. It
would be six months before he would
be inaugurated and six months after
that before the proposed silver legis
lation could be enacted. In the mean
time all obligations would be enforced ;
merchant* would collect all outstand
ing debt* In order to protect them
se vt-H against depreciated money ; de
positors would withdraw their m-mey
from the bunks; the mills and factories
which are now in operation would be
closed, and millions of men would be
added to those already idle. â Hon. C.
C. Shayne of New Y.it-1 .
CATOR ON DEBT-PAYING.
In bis address at San Diego on Wednes
day night Mr. Cator, amone other things,
is reported to have said: "If they dump
shiploads of silver upon us let them
dump. We will coin it into money and it
will raise the price of all products, and we
can pay our debts with half the labor and
sweat that is expended now."
It is difficult to say whether this state
ment is to be condemned most for its
folly or its dishonesty. If Mr. Cator
meant to imply that the personal debts of
Californians could be paid more cheaply
und er free silver be spoKe either foolishly
or falsely, for almost ail debts in this
State are in express terms made payable
in gold. If be meant to imply that tbe
National Government would pay in silver
what it promised in gold be appealed to
nothing more tnan such dishonesty aa he
may have supposed to exist among bis
hearers, and urged tbem to enter upon a
policy which could result in nothing less
than National dishonor.
Tiie effect of free-silver coinage would
be that the producer would have to sell
bis produce for silver, while be would
have to pay bis debts in gold according to
the express contract. The workingman
would have to receive his wages in silver,
while tbe mortgage on bis borne would
still bavu to be paid in gold. Tbe pro
ducer and the workingman would be com
pelled to buy this gold at a premium, and
the payments which are now heavy would
then be well nigh insupportable and
ruinous.
There is much to be said for bimetallism,
and the abler and more intelligent advo
cates of that pysteni bave arguments for
it to which tbe whole world listens with
respect. But the advocates of the Uryan
plan of free silver are presenting their
policy to the people in a form which ex
cites the mockery of the intelligent and
tbe scorn of the honest. Mr. Cator has
shown himself in his stump speeches to
be one of the least reliable advocates of
free silver in the State. It is not certain
whether he speaks from an honest ignor
ance, or whether, in his eager ambition to
be Senator, he believes he can deceive and
defraud the people by statements which,
while they cannot be sustained either by
fact or reason, may yet win him votes
among those who seek any sort of relief
from the hard times which they are un
dergoing.
We commend thepe words from his San
Di-eo speech to the consideration of hon.
est Populists and conservative Democrats-
Are they willing under any circumstances
to vote for legislators who would send the
advocate of such a sentiment aa the one
quoted to represent California in tbe
United States Senate?

Nobody will complain then of McKinley prices
at the stores.â Portland Oregonian.
Mr. Bryan may as well bid good-by to the
farmer vote. No matter what may happen in
the next month, however, two things have
been proved ugain before the very eyes of our
people. One is that an enormous rise in the
price of a leading commodity can occur with
out any change whatever in the volume of
currency; the otner is that the prices of silver
and wheat have no connection or relation to
each other. On the opposite of these two
commandments have bun? all the law and
the gospel of Bryanism and Populism. â St.
Paul Globe.
LADY'S NIGHT DRESS.
Night robes made in the old-fashioned sack
shape with large sleeves and a big collar are
very pretty, and have the advantage of re
quiring less material than other shapes. The
back may be made with a bias seam, which
avoids piecing at tbe bottom, and cuts to better
advantage. The ease with which these crowns
may be laundered recommends them to many.
Lounging, or bath robes, are cut after the
same model, being liked as they aie less bulky
than those with pleats or gathers at the top.
Batiste is the material used when any nice
gowns are made. A sailor collar is made of
fine Hamburg edging, which is seaaied from
all the corners to the neck, to bring all the
scallops around the edge.
White lawn is also used, and With a collar of
the gnme, trimmed on the edge with an inser
tion of Valenciennes lace, and beyond this a
ruffle of the plain lawn or of embroidery, is
very dainty. A collar with embroidery set on
with braiding through which delicate colored
ribbons are drawn is also pretty.
These gowns may be made quite elaborate by
tucking the goods down the back and the
front, and also tucking th sleeves.
Heavy nightgowns of flannelette or heavy
muslin cannot be better made than in this
style. The collar may be of China silk for
flannelette gown to give a dainty touch, for
the silk wears quite as well as the flannelette.
LEMONS AND ORANGES.
Injury Hone the Grower* of CUrua Fruit*
by th* Free- Trader â *. â¢
American Economist.
Our imports of lemons and oranges for the
fiscal years 1890 to 1896 have been as follows :
year. Value. Value.
1890. .....$3,574,033 $1,016,652

1895 4,917,3^6 &22I'?S?
1896...........;.. 6,040.344 2.694,131
The Imports of lemons and oranges for the
latest fiscal year, ending', June 30, 1896, were
larger than in any previous year on record.
This must be unsatisfactory news to American
growers of citrus fruits in Florida and Califor
nia, because every single orange or lemon that
we buy irom abroad takes the place of Ameri
can-grown fruit and helps to depreciate tee
value of the produce of our own orchards.' â  ~
Growers of oranges and lemons should call
to mind the fact that they receive less protec
tion under the Gorman- Wilson bill than was
accorded them by the McKinley tariff, the
rates of duties being respective. as follows:.
- McKinley tariffâ l 3 cents per package measur-
Ipr li/4 cubic teei; 25 cents per package of fro
IV* to vi/ 2 cubic feet; 60 cents per package from
aVa to 6 cubic feet: 10 cents for each aidltionai
cubic foot or part thereof: $1 60 per thousand lor
lemons or oranges Imported in bulk; 30 per cei.t ad
valorem on boxes or barrels unless made of Amer
ican material.
Gorman-Wilson billâ B cents per coble foot ca
pacity on all pnekaces; *1 60 per thousand when
Imported In bulk; 80 percent Â»d valor -m on the
boxes or barrels unless made of American mate
rial.
On the smallest-sized package in which
oranges or lemons are imported the reduction
in duty under the existing Democratic tariff
is nearly 40 per cent: on packages of medium
size the reduction ranges from 20 to 60 per
cent, and on the largest-sized packages the
loss of protection also ranges irom 20 to 60 per
cent, with 20 per cent additional loss on every
package measuring more than five cubic feet.
This loss of protection undoubtedly accounts
for our imports of foreign-grown lemons and
oranges having reached their highest point
during the 1896 fiscal year. Owners of citrus
orchards in Calitornia and Florida will
promptly recognize that their interests will be
best protected by the election of Major Mc-
Kinley and of Republican Congressmen, and
they should without hesitation vote against
every Democratic free-trader from Bryan down.
THE MEASURE OF BRYAN'S DEFEAT
New York Press.
The Republican poll ol voters in Illinois es
tablishes two facts that must bring rejoicing
to the country. The first is that Illinois will
be Republican by an enormous majority; the
second is that neither the farmers nor the
wage-earners of this country have been de
ceived by Mr. Bryan's ciaptrap.
The poll for the State of Illinois outside of
Cook County (Chicago) showed a Republican
majority of 85,000. Furthermore, the count
among workingmen proved that they were
overwhelmingly for McKinley, so that it is
confidently expected that the wage-earners of
Chicago will add vastly to the Republican ma
jority in the rest of Illinois.
The result of this poll in Illinois demon
strates what the Press has before pointed out,
and what it wishes to repeat witli emphasis,
lhat Mr. Bryan is so grotesquely weak a can
didate that it is posvible to make his defeat
not only a dis-grace to him and his following
now, but a warning to all political aaven
turersin the future.
Tiie expectation of complete success at the
November election should not tempt Republi
cans and their allies to diminish tneir activity
and earnestness. Rather should the ever
brightening prospects confirm them in their
determination to wipe oui the free-coinage
band once and for all. Foreseeing defeat in
the coming election, the Bryanites are already
dec.aring that they propose to continue in
future years their warfare against honesty
and honor.
Well, then, the people must see to it that
after November 3 the free-silver remnant will
not have strength enough even to call for help,
In order that we shall be able to go about re
storing the prosperity of our Nation without
fear of further plot and conspiracy the voters,
after they have beaten the silver forces, must
cv. them to pieces. They must convert the
dtfe t into a rout; they mus. press the rout to
a slaughter.
If you want a good dollar vote for it next
month.
WHAT MAKES A DOLLAR.
"Every dollar in existence,"' exclaims Mr
Bryan, "is the creature of law." Right you
are, Mr. Bryan, but tne stuff of which every
dollar is made is the pioductof labor. Tbe
mint mam on a coin is merely an official cer
tificate that the laborer's product is as fine and
as heavy as it purports to be. It can't make
an ounce of silver weigh an ounce and a half,
nor can it in any other manner increase the
actual commercial value of the metal on
which it is stamped. Don't overlook the fun
damentals, Mr. Bryan. Coinage measures val
ues, but it doesn't create them. The strongest
dollar is the one that contains no "fiat." The
weakest dollar is the one that contains the
least value as a commercial commodity. â New
York Mail and Express.
THE TRETER-BOARD BOOMERANG.
When we were young we used to play upon
the teeter-board, and even in our childhood
days we knew that when one end of the teeter
bourd went up the other end went down.â
William J. Bryan.
Just so, and what is troubling William J.
Bryan nowadays is to show how the "prices"
end of the teeter-board is to go up for the
benefit of the farmer without the "wages" end
of the teeter-board going down at the same
time, to the injury of the workingman. â
Louisville Courier-Journal.
NOT QUOTING TILDEN.
It will be observed that in trying to make
witnesses of departed statesmen in favor of
cheap money Mr. Bryan carefully avoids Sam
uel J. Tilden, who declared that the farmer
"ought to be secure in the tranquillity of his
fireside from the curse of an unstable and
fluctuating|currency."â St. Louis Globe-Demo

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS
Wormsâ E. A. 8., City. Worms in dogs arise
from various causes. They are seldom found
in healthy dogs. When a dog is so affected the
owner should tone up the animal's stomach
and other organs, by which means food is
prevented from running into fermentation, and
a vermifuge, to be obtained from any druggist,
should be administered.
Importsâ J. 8., City. The Wilson-Gorman
tariff act went into effect on the Ist of August,
1894. During the year ending June 30, 1889,
the imports into the United States, as appears
from the figures furnished by the Treasury
Department, amounted to $745,131,652; for
1890 the amount was $789,310,409; for 1891,
$844,916,196; for 1893, $827,402,462. The
years given all end June 30.
Books fob Boysâ A Constant Reader, City.
There are so many good and useful books that
a boy of 17 years can read with proflt that this
department has not the room to print a list of
them, but as you are a resident of this City
you can go the Free Library and there you
will find in the Monthly Bulletin a list of
the beet books for a boy of that age under the
title "Books for the Young."
Cleveland's Cabinetâ A. &, Palermo, Cal.
The Cleveland Cabinet is composed of the fol
lowing named: R. Olney, Secretary of State;
J. G. Carlisle, Secretary of the Treasury; D. S.
Laraont, Secretary of War; J. Harmon, Attor
ney-General; W. L. Wilson, Postmaster-
General; H. A. Herbert, Secretary of the Xavy;
D. R. Francis, Secretary of the Interior; and
J. 8. Morton, Secretary of Agriculture.
Light English Coinâ Old Subscriber, City.
The English Government does not redeem
worn or "light coin," as it. is called, at face
value. It receivei the light gold coins for re
coinage and returns coin of the full mint
value less the deficiency of weight. In the
case of silver coins the loss on the recolnage of
silver money is now covered by the seignirage
arising from the difference between the real
and the nominal value of the coins. â¢
Studying Lawâ SubÂ«criber, Vanderbilt, San
Bernardino County, Cal. If you wish to study
law you had better consult an attorney, who
will probably let you read law in his office for
service? you may render him. Such a person
would be better able to tell you what your ca
pacity for study will enable you to grasp first,
li you wish to study by yourself you had bet
ter read the codes of the State you live in
books on evidence, books on practice and books
on contracts.
, Tamale- New Subscriber, City. The tamales"
that are sold in the San Francisco markets are
made of chicken, olive* and cornmeal, and sea
soned with tomato sauce to which has been
added a dose of f red % pepper. The cornmeal is
made into a paste that is spread on corn husks
that nave been dipped in hot water. On a
layer jof ;- the ; cornmeal â is placed f a piece *of
chicken, previously boiled,' and an olive; then
some of the tomato sauce i* poured over these
and rolled together; then Rucccssive layers of
paste-covered husks are added, the who. Mied
and steamed. But it takes nn adept to make
them.

City aKd Townâ N. N., Livcrmore, Cal. A
City is a municipal corporation that is gov
erned by a Mayor and either ft Common Coun*
cil or Board of Supervisors. A town is n place
that has denned boundaries like a city, but a
less elaborate government than a city. It has
no Mayor. The powers of a Mayor aro defined
in the different States and it is impossible in
this department to pive tne powers vexted iv
such officials in ihe sevtri'l Slates. f:ie Po
litical Code of this State defines the powers
and duties of Mayor in Caliiornia. A Mayor is
elected by the people. Tne president ot' a
Town Council Is, as a rule, chosen from among
the Town Councilmen.
A WO-tm for Presidentâ Constant Reader,
City. There is not anything in the constitu
tion of the United States that says a woman
may not become President. The fifth clause
sec. I, art. 2, says:
No person excep- a natural-born citizen or a
citizen ot the United States at the time of the
adoption of the constitution slmii b â  olipibleto th*
office of President: neither shall any person be
eligible to that office who shall not have attained
to Uie age of tliiny-live years und be.-v fourteen
years a resident within the United states.
Now, if a woman born in the United State-i is
not 1- a natural-born citizen" and if she is not
a "person" what is she?

Flypaperâ L. H., Weaverville, Cal. It is
stated that the following methods of making
flypaper will prove effective : Pour a ouart of
water over a pound of quassia wood and let it
stand over night; strain and boil down to one
pint. Boil the wood again in a pint of water
untii reduced one-half ; mix the two liquids,
add a quarter ot a pound of sugar, and wheu
the sugar has dissolved pass sheets of porous
pnper tnrough the liquid and hang them up to

The Harbor Commissionprs held their
usual session yesterday. It did not last
very long, as there was not much business
to transact, and furthermore, Commis
sioner Chadbourne was in New York. The
schooner Ida Fchnauer was tabooed, and
in future she will have to anchor in the
stream. A few weeks ago she incurred an
indebtedness of ?8 40 at Main-street wharf
and the captain ia'led to pay it. The Com
missioners decided to double tne charge
and also impose a fine of $10. Until the
$26 80 is paid the schooner will have to
load and unload in the stream.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
Mariposa sailed for Australasia last night
She was loaded down with freight and
several hundred tons of canned goods were
left on the wharf awaiting the next
steamer. Nearly one hundred passengers
were in the cabin, while the steerage was
well patronized.
Among those who vrent away were the
Australian cricketers and Charles Cavill,
the swimmer. "There's no use in my
staying here," said Cavill just prior to
the sailing of the ship. "At one time I
thought a race from Fort Point to Point
Lobos and back between Tom Sharkey
and myself might be pulled off. Had it
come to a pinch I would have given him
or any other man a half hour start, but
no one seemed to take any interest in the
proposition, so it fell through. You have
no swimmers in California. They are
good for a spurt, but when it comes to
genuine hard work they are not in if.
When it comes to a question of athletic
sports Australia cannot be beat."
The Mariposa went out as spick and
span as a yacht, bhe was thoroughly
overhauled and Chief Steward Hannigan
bad his particular domain in apple-pie
order. New carpets were laid and all the
staterooms were fixed with new curtains.
All tbe woodwork was repainted and in
consequence the Mariposa looked like a
new ship when she went out yesterday.
Sailors on coasting vessels have had to
submit to the usual winter cut It was a
question of laying the vessels up or reduc
ing wages and the owners decided upon
the latter course. Formerly men on the
lumber ships got $30 a month, now they
only get $25. On the colliers they got $25
a month, now they only get $22 50. At
first there was a disposition to strike, but
when tbe Shipowners' Association ex
plained tbe matter to the Coast Seamen's
Union the whole question was settled.
When freights pick up tae old rate will be
restored, but at tbe present time it simply
means lower wages or tie up the vessels.
"Tom" James, the popular steward of
tbe Australia, may not go out on tbe

important position in New Orleans and
the chances are he will accept it.
The big Spreckels tusr Fearless will start
for Puget Sound to-day with a dredger in
tow. She will also have a number of
pumps aboard and some work on the

the Fearless will probably bring down the
British ship Kilbrannon. She went on
almost the same point as the Umatilla,
but tbe necessary repairs being consider
able si-e was sold to San Francisco ship
ping men and will come here to be refitted.
Tbe chances are that she will be put under
the Hawaiian nag.
The tramp steamer Transit, from Puget

INVITE INVESTMENT.
Producers' Association Will Take Ac
tion to Encourage the Coming
of Capital.
The regular meeting of the directors of
the Manufacturers' and Producers' Associ
ation was held yesterday; present: Presi
dent Julian Sonntag and Directors Mead,
Kerr, Keller, Currier and McLaughlin.
Manager S. H. Tacy presented his report
of the Home Products Exposition held
under the auspices of the association and
tbe Mechanics' Institute, in which he
says:
The gross receipts, I am advised by the sec
retary of tho Mechanics' Institute, will be
about $35,000, as against $33,800 in 1895,
and the expenditures about $28,000, as
agxinst $22,610 in 1895. The net profit will
therefore be about $7000 this year, as actainst
$10,184 in 1895. It will be seen by the gross
receipts that it was a wise move to reduce the
single admission from 50 cents to 25 cents. It
was the best exposition ever held in the
Pavilion and one of the most largely at
tended.
After further discussion of the fair, Mr.
Tacy brought np the matter of inducing
capitalists to become interested in various
enterprises. One great drawback in this
direction he sums up in this language:
At the present lime there is no limit to the
liability of stockholders of corporations or
joint stock associations, with the result tbat
capital is loin to embark in industrial enter
prises in this State, by the adoption of amend
ment No. 3, stockholder* of a corporation or
joint stock association are limited in liability
lor the debts of the corporation for only the
amouD 1 oi the face value of the shares of the
subscribed capital stock. The adoption of this
amendment would no doubt cause a large in
vestment of capital in Industrial enterprises
in California, as it did in England, where upon
the adoption of a limited liability act there
were millions of dollars invested in corpora
tions by peopie oi limited means. The shares
of many very large industrial corporations in
England ere to-day owned largely by people
in moderate circumsunces, and as similar re
sults will be sure to follow in this State, it is
of the utmost importance that this association
do what it can between now and November 3
to urge the people lo vote for amendment
No. 3.
The report was adopted, and the recom
mendation relative to amendment No. 3
was refererd to the committee on legisla
tion. President Bonntag was directed to
communicate with the State Board of
Prison Directors, asking for a conference
at which the two bodies will decide apon
some plan by which the convicts will not
conflict with free labor.
ANOTHER ELECTION CASE
P. A. Dolan Seeks for a Man
date Against Registrar
Hinton.
Free Silver and Protection Party Files
a Petition to Be Placed on
tbe Ballot.
P. A. Dolan, candidate for the office of
Superintendent of Streets under the nomi
nation of the Free bilver and Protection
party, appeared before the Supreme Court
yesterday, with bis attorney, Henry M.
McGill, as a petitioner for a writ of man
date against William M. Hinton, Regis
trar.
Mr. Dolan set np in his petition that the
Free Silver and Protection party was or
ganized about September 2, 1896, by a large
number of citizens of San Francisco; that
a complete municipal ticket was nomi
nated for all the public offices to be filled
by tbe electors at tbe general election of
November 3, 1896; that on October 12 the
party delivered to Registrar Hinton a cer
tiiicate of nomination?, etc., and that this
was certified and signed by at least 3 per
cent of the electors resident in this City
and County, to wit, 3313 electors.
The petition also enumerates the other
necessary legal forms and declares that
they were ail complied with lully. The
R gistrar refused to file the certificate or
to place tbe nameo of the candidates on
the official ballot, etc.
The suspense of the petitioner in this
matter was brief. Halt an hour after the
application was made it was denied, com
ing back with the following indorsement:
"Petition denied for want of time to hear
it and without prejudice to an application
to the Superior Court." This was signed
by Chief Justice Beatty. Mr. Dolan and
his attorney declared their intention to
bring tbe matter up in the Superior Court.

THE TURN OF THE TIDE
NEW COMMANDER
AT THE PRESIDIO
Colonel Shafter Will Soon
Be the Ruler of the
Reservation.
Four Companies of the First In
fantry to Be Stationed at
the Post.
SURPRISE IN ARMY CIRCLES.
Colonel Bainbri<?g3 and Major Darling
of the Third Artil'ery Ordered
to Angel Island
The honor and dnty of commanding the
post at the Presidio yesterday devolved
upon Captain Frank Thorp, Light Battery
D, Fifth Artillery. He is now the senior
officer of the Fiith at tbe station, General
Graham being en route to the Department
of the East and Major John A. Darling
having been transferred to the Third
Artillery.
This incident was not the only surprise
in military circles yesterday. The decree
has been issnea that the four companies
of the First Infantry now at Angel Island
will be brought to the Presidio, and on the
return of General Forsyth to the duties of
department commaader Colonel William
K. Shatter will take command at tbe
Presidio. The infantry companies may
come over to-day. Captain Francis E.
Pierce will command at the Presidio until
Colonel Shafter is relieved of his duties as
commander of the department.
The batteries of the Third Artillery left
their respective stations in the south yes
terday for San Francisco and should arrive
here Thursday of next week.
The second surprise yesterday was the
annexed order:

[Extract.]
Â»Â»â¢â¢â¢â¦â¢â¢*
3. The Third Artillery, on its arrival in this
department, will take station as follows:
The headquarters, colonel, Major John A.
Darling, staff, band, and batteries D, 1 and H
at Angei Island, Cel.
The lieutenant-colonel, light batteries C and
F and batteries Q and X at the Presidio of San
Francisco, Cal.
Mai or Wallace F.Randolph and batteries A
and L at Alcatraz Island, Cal.
Battery E at Fort Mason, Cal.
By order of Colonel Shafter.
O. D. Grkenk,
Assistant Adjutant-General.
It wag surmised that Colonel Bain
bridge of the Third Artillery would sue
ceea to the command at the Presidio, but
other arrangements must have been made
in Washington to place Colonel Shafter,
who is the senior colonel in the army, in
command at San Francisco. Colonel
Bainbridge will have, however, a delight
ful station at Angel Island, where the
duties are not exacting. This change in
the assignment of troops may accord with
his inclinations.
TRAVELING EASTWARD.
Departure of the Seoond Command
of the Fifth Artillery for
New YorK.
The headquarters, colonel, staff, band
and batteries A, B, C, I and M of the
Fifth Artillery sailed away from the Pre
sidio wharf on the steamer McDowell
shortly after 6 o'clock last evening. There
was a deal of burrahing, and cheers were
given for the Fifth Artillery, for General
Graham and California.
The departure from the Presidio was
only an incident compared to the demon
stration at the Oakland mole just before
the train pulled out for the East. The 7
o'clock Oakland boat from this side car
ried over a vast throng of friends, rela
tives and sweethearts of the artillerymen.
The girls were out in groups and single file.
Under the big roof the good-bys were
spoken and when the soldiers boarded the
train there was a long line of men, women
and children grasping hands held out ol
the car-windows. An hour's time was
taken to put all tbe baggage aboard and
get the wives and children of the enlisted
men assigned to their respective cars.
During tbe wait the canteen was passed
around frequently among the atillerymen
and soon songs and cheers were the order
of the occasion. When the hilarious sol
diers observed a parting scene particularly
tender and pathetic they wailed snd
sobbed in a cnorus of mimic grief. The
absurdity of a whole battery crying in
unison and wailing in chorus elicited
peais of laughter.
Promises to return to California on first
furlougn or to come back at the expira
tion of the service term were given and
repeated to console the maidens. "When
the cars began to move the soldiers aboard
waved their hats and cheered for Cali
fornia.
Seventeen passengers belonging to offi
cers' families and forty-five belonging to
families of enlisted men were on the train.
Among them were many children.
The officers who went last evening were:
General Graham; Lieutenant Galbraith,
adjutant; Lieutenant Adams, quarter
master; Captains and Assistant Surgeons
Euclid B. Frick and George M. Wells;
Captains Benjamin K. Roberts, Battery
A; Luigi Lomia. Battery H; 0. E. Wood,
Battery C; E. R. Hills, Battery I, and
Lieutenant Winston, Battery M. The
officers occupied the Pullmau car Cerro
Gordo. The band did not play, as the
instrumeuts were packed.
Among the National Guard officers who
went across the bay to pay a parting salute
to the Fifth were Colonels H. P. Bush and
Denis Geary.
Light Batteries D and F of thÂ« Fifth
Artillery yet remain at the Presidio. The
time for their departure was recently ex
tended until October 30.
A GUATEMALAN EXHIBIT.
1 fforts to Show Our Goods at the
Forthcoming Fair.
Carl H. Clark, who was formerly con
nected with the Southern Pacific Railroad
in a prominent way, and who did the
heavy work in connection with getting
the exhibits together for the recent suc
cessful Mechanics' Institute Fair, will
probably go to Guatemala with an exhibit
of California products.
Matters are shaping themselves that way
now, and it is generally believed that it
would be a good thing for tbe State. The
Guatemalan Exposition, or World's Fair,
as it is sailed, opens at Guatemala City on
March 15 and continues to July 15. Mr.
Clark and some leading merchants have
gone over the subject of an exhibit. The
business men want Mr. Clark to go and
take charge of the exhibits at any rate,
but it has been suggested that it would be
better if it took a wider range and the
Chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade
backed it. It will therefore come up be
fore both organizations, and it is hoped
their support can be gained. In that event
there would be a large and very creditable
exhibit.
"A while ago Mr. Townsend was sent
over to Japan," said Mr. Clark last night,
"in the interest of ihe enlargement of our
trade tt.ere, and we want to get what we
can in China and Australia, but Central
America, being closer to us, is on reason
able grounds as much or more important."
COMMISSION OVERRULED
Union Transportation Steamers
Need Not Move
Away.
By Supreme Conrt Decision Their Oc
cupancy of tbe Clay-Street
Berth Is F.xed.
The Union Transportation Company will
not be compelled to move its boats away
from the Clay-street wharf, the decision of
the Superior Court, which was in favor of
the company as against the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners, having been up
held by tbe Supreme Court in a decision
which was 1 handed down yesterday.
In February, 1892, tbe Union Transpor
tation Company applied to the Board of
State Harbor Commissioners for a suitable
berth for their boats at some one of tbe
wharves on the San Francisco water front.
The Commissioners on June 8, 1892, as
signed a berth at the Clay-street wharf,
which was occupied by the company for a
time. August 2, 1892, the Commissioners
adopted a resolution rescinding tbe order
of June 8, 1892, and asssigned a berth at
the Mission-street wharf. This was op
posed by the company, and forty firms of
produce and commission merchants signed
a protest to force tbe company to dock
at Mission street.
Then the Commissioners, on August 25,
1892, adopted other resolutions which pro
vided that tbe use of the Clay-street wnarf
by the company must terminate Septem
ber 27, 1892. The company then, on Octo
ber 5, 1892, commenced an action to en
join tbe Harbor Commissioners from en
forcing their resolutions and orders. The
Superior Court found for the company.
The Harbor Commissioners having been
denied a new trial in the Superior Court
appealed the case to the Supreme Court.
In the decision handed down by tbe
Supreme Court yesterday, the opinion be
ing by Commissioner Van Clief, the court i
affirmed the judgment and order of the
Superior Court. Some points from the
opinion are as follows: "It does not ap
pear that it was necessary to remove plaint
iff's boats to another wharf which was
unsuitable for its business. The policy of
the law creating and governing the Har
bor Commission seems to favor the con
centration of each kind of business, and
it is obvious that the public would be bet
ter accommodated by such concentration.
"It is urged that the courts will not de
clare an order or regulation of the govern
ing board of a municipal corporation void
except in a plain case of abuse of authority.
Conceding this, it does not follow that the
courts are powerlew to give relief in all
cases where the evidence is conflicting.
The decree enjoins the board from enforc
ing the order of removal to Mission street
and from unlawfully requiring plaintiff to
dock its boats elsewhere than at the'Ciay
street wharf. Appellants contend that
this gives the plaintiff a perpetual vested
right '0 dock at Clay-street wharf and en
joins defendants from interfering there
with for any caus*. But such is not the
meaning of the decree. The board is not
enjoined from removing plaintiff's boats
f om Clay-street whari for any lawful
cau3f nor from making any reasonable
regulation or order."
The opinion is concurred in by Commis
sioners Searls and Belcher, and the judg
ment and order are confirmed by Justices
Harrison, Garoutte and Van Vleet.

IS OUACKENBUSH
A MARRIED MAN?
A Millionaire Sues to Quiet
His Title as a
Bachelor.
And Mrs. Abbott Stoutly Main
tains That She Is His
Lawiul Wife.
A CASE WIIH NOVEL POINTS.
The Issue Leads an Aged Ccnple to
Settle the Status of a Ro
mance in Court.
The suit of aged Millionaire Thomas M.
Quackenbush against Mrs. Nancy A. Ab
bott, widow, whereby he seeks to settle
his heretofore undisturbed title of bach
elor and Â«how to the world that he is not
a benedict, is one of the most peculiar ever
brought in a California court, and the
matter was the subject of considerable dis
THOMAS M. QUACKENBUSH, Who Denies That He Is Mrs.
Nancy Abbott's Husband.
cussion in legal circles and among the
iriends of the litigants yesterday.
All day the aged oapitalist sat quietJy
in nis rooms, 911 Webster street, receiving
the congratulations of the many friends
who applauded him for his bold dash to
repel the accusation of matrimony, while
the friends of Mrs. Abbott called on her
at 431 Eddy street and congratulated her
that a step had been taken by "her hus
band" which would enable her to appear
before the whole world as the original and
only genuine Mrs. Thomas M. Quacken
bush, with documentary title undisputed.
The plaintiff in the novel suit is now
quite used up oy disease, having suffered
for many years from rheumatic com
plaints, and the defendant is a motherly
looking woman of 60, wbo has a family of
grown-up sons. Tne parties to tne suit
were not averse to discussing the merits
of the case when seen yesterday. Mr.
Quackenbush said:
"I know Mrs. Abbott very well, for I
used to room at her house at Jackson
street and Montgomery avenue, but she is
not my wife and has never been. When I
MRS. NANCY ABBOTT, Who Says Thomas M. Quackcnbush
Is Her Husband.
was well I paid her ?16 a month for a
room, and when I was ill I gave her $60 a
month for the room and services as nurse.
"The first time I ever dreamed there
would be a claim thai we were married
was when friends commenced to congratu
late me on the event a year or so ago, and
when I told them I was not married they
looked upon it as foolishness, and said
they would let me down easy on the jokf,
but" it came up so often that I grew
alarmed, and found that a serious claim
' was based on what they said to me, a
claim not less than one of absolute matri
mony. Now, since I never married Mrs.
Abbott and never intended to do so, I
propose to see that I am declared duly
single ere I die, so that no claim can be
made when lam gone. I admit I usea to
room at the woman's house, Montgomery
avenue and Jackson street, also on Powell
street. My signature to any purported
marriage contract has been obtained by
fraud, and that is all there is to it."
Mrs. Abbott gracefully admits that her
true name is Mrs. Quackenbush. says she
has been wronged and neglected, and af
tirni9 that she has been the wife of
Quackenbush for about twelve years,
being as persistent in her claim as the fa
mous Mrs. Bardell in the immortal crea
tion of Dickens.
"Why, there is my husband's picture,"
said Mr^. Abbott, as she pointed to a
large crayon of the plaintiff, neatly
framed and hanging in a conspicuous part
of the house. "He dare not "deny what
we have been to each otner for twelve
long years, and he would not do it but for
his son-in-law, who is my enemy. Why,
Mr. Quackenbush was here to see me
only a lew weeks ago. and he will not dare
deny what I claim. Kut he is old and
feeble now, and that is the reason."
So plaintiff and defendant sat at their
respective homes last night, seize'i with
I inordinate ambition in the evening of
S their lives, he to maintain his inteerity as
: a bachelor and she to prove herself the
! lawful wifp, by contract, of the roan of her
choice, whose love she says she found
more precious than rubies and comforting
as the snadow of a great rock in a weary
land.
Each party to the suit is equally confi
dent of success, and they say there can be
no compromise.
It is alleged by Attorney Arthur Rodgers
that Mrs. Abbott will be able to show that
she was the contract wife of the plaintiff.
Her claim is based on the following con
tract, drawn in leadpencil, in a feminine
hand:
San Francisco, Nov. 15, 1889.
Know all men that I, Thomas M. Quacken
bush, of the City of San Francisco, State of
California, and Nancy Ann Abbott of San
Francisco, State of California, do agree to live
together as man and wife, share and share
alike, so long as we both shall live.
Ths. M. Quackenbush.
/ Nancy Ann Abbott.
It will be claimed tnat the couple lived
together at Jackson street and Montgom
ery avenue as husband and wife, and that
their friends generally knew of the rela
tionship. Quackenbush, however, main
tained that Mrs. Abbott admitted on sev
eral occasions, in the presence of his at
torney, E. J. Pringle, that she was not his
wife, and had never made such a pre
tense. The case will be bitterly contested
at every point.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16. 1896.
BOUGHT A COSTLY
PIG IN A POKE
Non- Partisans Insist on
Enforcing Pro- Charter
Pledges.
Democratic Legislative Nomi
nees Get in Some Smooth
Work.
WILL CERTAINLY INJURE THEM
Mr. Sbarboro Utters the Adverse Sen
timents of the Majority of His
Associates.
The sensation of the day in political cir
cles yesterday was the publication of a
leiter from the Democratic legislative
nominees, announcing that they had de
cided to modify their pledge to support
the adoption of the new charter in case of
their election. They explained that they
do not yet know the wishes of their con
stituents in the different Senatorial and
Assembly districts, and now they want a
change made in their pledge, so that they
shall be guided in their votes in favor of
or against the instrument, according as
tne majority of the electors in their dis
tricts may by their votes direct.
As might be expected a smooth proposi
tion of this kind created no end of discus
sion among the active workers in all po
litical parties. In no other place, how
ever, did it cause so much excitement as
in the headquarters of the Citizens' Non-
Partisaii campaign committee.
A special meeting of the committee was
held to bear the communication read in a
formal way, though all the members knew
of its contents, as was evidenced by their
looks of dissatisfaction and the few re
marks of censure that were casually let
fall by those usually conservative and
reticent gentlemen.
After the meeting had been called to
order by Chairman George K. Fitch the
letter was read by Secretary 1. T. Milli
ken, after which there was a brief pause,
each waiting for his neighbor to express
an opinion.
Some mildly condemnatory resolutions
were offered for the consideration of tlie
meeting, but at the suggestion of Chair
man Pitch they were withdrawn, and at
last the committee decided to take no
action in regard to the matter.
This conclusion was not reached with
out discussion, however, and if each
gentleman wbo signed the letter did not
feel his left ear burning then there is no
more dependence to be placed in folk lore
signs tnan in the pledges of Democratic
legislative nominees.
"We have their signatures to an un
qualified pledge to support the charter if
tney are elected, have we not?" asked a
member ot the committee.
"Yes," was the reply.
"Then let us hold them to their agree
ment," was the unanimous decree of all
present.
It was so ordered.
The secretary's minutes show that the
committee declined to take any formal
action in the premises.
Some of the running comments on the
peculiar action taken by these would-be
legislators were decidedly pungent, and
while no one said or even directly inti
mated that the owners of the signatures
should be boycotted there was a tacit un
derstanding that Mr. Braunhart and his
associates in this remarkable affair had
not increased their popularity.
â¢ Some bitterness was manifested over
the reflection that it was too late for the
names of these gentlemen to be removed
from the legal ballot so that other more
sincere men might be substituted.
"Supposing they had signed a contract
for the acceptance of a valuable franchise
under conditions of importance to the
community, do you think they would
have had tne gall to come in and try to
change the terms of the contract, after it
was too late for anybody else to come in,
without at least consulting with the
parties on the other side?" was anxiously
asked by several members of the com
mittee.
To this very pertinent question there
was no reply.
A. Sbarboro, a prominent member of the
Non-Partisan organization, sa J d: "I don't
know what others will do, but I have a
pretty clear idea of my own course. Cer
tainly it isn't necessary to say much about
this matter. It explains itself. I don't
know that I ever heard of such a thing be
fore. If the gentlemen on that ticket had
any such ideas in regard to tneir duty on
the question of the charter they ought to
have mentioned it before they got our in
dorsement. Then they would have been
free and we also would have been free. It
is a strange proceeding, to say the least. 1 '
Other Non-Partisans expressed them
selves more strongly. They said it was no
use for the Democratic nominees to try to
back out. "They have been bought with
a price and they are ours. We gave our
indorsement for their pledge to support
the charter and the contract cannot be an
nulled in any sucn way," were the words
of a Non-Partisan leader.
But thepe expressions of personal
opinion wili not be recognized as binding
oh the great body of Non-Partisan voters,
and the candidates who have shown them
selves recreant to their pledges will
have to suffer the consequences of their
perfidy.
Meanwhile the members of the opposi
tion parties are chuckling over the dis
comfiture of the Non-Partisans and are
likening the affair to a historical commer
cial transaction wherein a certain inex
perienced country boy paid too high a
price for a pig in a poke.
WILL HOT BE REHEARD.
The Supreme Court Declines to
Reconsider Eahn s vs.
Sutro.
With This Decision the Suit of Groez
inger Against Sntro Falls
to the Ground.
There will be no rehearing in the mat
ter of Kan o against Sutro and the other
members ol the Board of Election Com
missioners. This was decided yesterday
by the Supreme Court, and the suit of
Groezinger against Sutro, which was simi
lar and involved the same issues as Kalin
against Sutro, took the same course â a re
hearing denied.
The issue raised in Kahn against Sutro,
which was decided some weeks ago by the
Supreme Court, involved the construction
of the county government act and the
tenure of offices in this City and County,
and incidentally an interpretation of the
relations of certain officers to the munici
pality. The court found that certain offi
cers are City officers and others are County
officers in San Francisco. A dissenting
opinion was riled, in which it was held
that all the officers stand on the same
plane.
Soon after the decision Garret McEn
erny filed a petition for a rehearing and
much interest was occasioned. Political
nominating conventions took cognizance
of the seeming uncertainty concerning the
tenure of office of certain officials. The
Supreme Court, by refusing a rehearing,
stands by its original decision.

PRICE MUST ANSWER
Formally t hargeA by a Coroner's Jury
With Murdering His Stepson,
lid ward Edgar.
William Price, who killed his stepson,
Edward J. Edgar, with a pair of scissors,
and Lee Mcc, who shot Quong Ah Chong,
were charged with murder by a Coroner's
jury yesterday.
Price took the stand in his own behalf.
He said that on the night of the killing
he had been attacked by Edgar, who
struck him (Price) with his fists. In self
defense, therefore, so Price says, he
picked up the scissors and struck at the
young man, th ough he had not intended
to stab him. Mrs. Price and Harold
Edgar, the latter a brother of the dead
man, swore that the attnek had been en
tirely unprovoked. Edgar had prevented
Price from slapping the face of his wife,
and had been stabbed to death for his
trouble. After a few minutes' deliberation
the jury returned a verdict that the blow
had been struck "with murderous intent."
In the case of Quong Ah Chong nothing
that has not already been puolished was
developed. Lee Mcc was charged with
the murder of Chong.
CHOOSE OFFICERS TO-DAY
Third Day's Session of the Grand
Lodge of Master
Masons.
A Lock of 0 d Hickory Jackson's Hair
and an Original Letter Among
the Archives.

In consequence of the lodge being ab
sent from the temple on Wednesday the
work of receiving the reports of the vari
ous standing committees, which is gener
ally disposed of on the second day's ses
sion, was continued this year to the third
day. Consequently the members did lit
tle else at yesterday's session except hear
ing and acting upon the reports of the
various standing committees.
The only divergence from this rule was
a discussion over the Masonic Cemetery
and the action of the trustees of that asso
ciation.
The election of officers has been set
down as the special order of business for
this forenoon, and in connection with this
it is thought that a general promo
tion will be the rule along the line with
the exception of the grand secretary and
treasurer, who will be re-elected.
The committees appointed by Grand
Master Preston are as follows:
Committee on jurisprudence â Xathan
Green Curtis, Wiley James Tmnan, Her
man Newton Rucker, William Johnston
and James B. Stevens.

Neff, Henry Hay Knapp, Charles Louis
Patton, Edward Stark Valentine and
George M. Perine.
Committee on correspondence â Andrew
J. Hare, Ernest W. Conant, James H.
Lindsey, Thomas Benton Reid and John
C. Voluntine.
Committee on grievance â William
Sewall Wills, William Thomas Reynolds,
Edward Reese Thompson, Frank Kava
nagh Lippitt and Jonn A. Beckwith.
Committee on members' pay â Orrin
Staples Henderson, Leander Warren
Tracy, Byron Ball, James Louis Barham
and Jacob Franklin Boiler.
Committee on charters â J. S. McÃnde,
William Sims, Robert Furlong, Daniel
Jones and John F. Johnson.
Committee on by-laws of lodges â Edson

Oscar A. Freeman. *
Last night the secret work of the order
was exemplified by the Grand Lodge
officers under the supervision of Grand
Lecturer William E. Sloane.
Among the many relics that are treas
ured by the officers of tne temple is a
short letter from President Andrew Jack
son, which was sent to the mother of
Colonel R. W. Powell, with a â  lock of the
President's hair. The letter is in the
nand writing of Mr. Jackson and is as fol
lows:
Mrs. E. Powell â Dr. Madam: At the request
of your son, Colonel R. W. Powell, it gives me
pleasure to send you a lock of my hair. With
due respects, your most obt. servant,
Andrew Jackson.

HIGHBINDERS EXCITED.
The See Yups Find Their Consul
Acted Under Yang's
Orders.
The Consul's Men Try to Complete
Their Work of the Day
Bsfore.
The See Yup-Sam Yup boycott is now
in its last throes. It is only a question of
a very short time until it expires and on
its dead body will be burned the incense
of peace.
As regards the cause of the demolition
of the See Yups' headquarters at 820 Clay
street and other highbinder institutions it
is now definitely known mat the local
Chinese Consul, Fung Yung Hang, was
acting under instructions received from
Yang, the Chinese Minister at "Washing
ton. The teleeram reads as follows:
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct 14.â Fung Yung
Hung, Consul-General, 806 Stockton street,
San Francisco, Cal.â lnstructions have been
issued to have bond of good behavior given
within limited period. Said period has ex
pired without compliance on the part of those
concerned, whose conduct is very disre
spectful.
You are to dissolve the highbinder societies
and the Sfee Yud Association without delay.
Non-compliance will subject you to impeach
ment and degradation from office. Yang.
The Bo Ong Tong, known as the strong
est highbinder institution in Chinatown,
wjiich not long ago reduced the Bo Leong
Tong to submission, is now desirous of
peace. Tne Bo Leongs, however, have
again renewed the feud and to their assist
ance have brought the See Ying Tong and
the Hop Ying Tong.
The Bee Yups had a demonstrative meet
ing at their quarters on Commercial street
Wednesday evening, at which the police
say Attorney Campbell was present, and
the situation was actively discussed. The
sympathies of the oolice are on the side of
the Chinese Consul, and they state that he
is merely endeavoring to put a quietus on
the lawless reign of Chinese haichetmen.
Charter Mass-Meetings.
The Young Men's Club of Bethany Church,
412 Bartlett street, will hold a mass-meeting
in favor of the charter this evening. It is ex
pected that addresses will be deliverea by

door in the rear room to the bay-window
area under tbe wedding bell. Down this
promptly at 8:30 came the wedding partjr,
led by the groom and his best man, Calla
ghan Byrnes, ami Charles Jost Jr. second.
Following came the bride, leaning 'on
the arm of her father, Lambert Van
Laak. The bridesmaids were Misses
Hattie and Lottie Van Laak, the
bride's sisters, Miss Carrie Elwart,
the groom's sister. Mrs. Elwart and
Mrs. Van Laak, mother of the groom
and of the bride, followed, forming the
wedding party. The music was stilled,
and Dr. Stebbins said those few words that
made the Dride a wife, the groom a hus
band.
Then followed the shower of congratu
lations, the wedding supper in the rooms
downstairs and afterward dancing.
The bride and her following of| maids
made a beautiful picture. She was gowned
in cream- white satin, trimmed with pearl
passementerie and duchesse lace. Her
long veil, stuuded with orange blossoms,
was held in place with a crest of diamonds
of regal magnificence, the gift of the
groom. She was very beautiful.
Her sisters â the Misses Hattie and Lot
tie â the former maid of honor, wore white
silk, covered with white chiffon, with
sprays of pink forget-me-nots. Miss
Carrie Elwart wore lavender silk, with lace
and passementerie. Ail carried bunches
of roses.
The wedding journey will be a short
one, but will be extended later to the home
of the groom in New York and afterward
will include a tour of Europe.
Dr. Elwart is a son of Dr. Charles El
wart of Portland and a nephew of Dr,
Zeile of this City. He resides and is a
practicing physician in New York City.

How the Artful Newsboy Worked
the Boycott*
the pavement around Lotta's fountain was
littered with fragments of their stock in
trade. Then every small, grimy paw in
the crowd went up in the air, and after
this Hannibal oath was taken Dougherty,
the boss newsboy, led his 500 strikers out.
Never was an industrial revolt so quietly
and so quietly put into motion. Almost
in an instant every small newsdealer all
over the City shut up shop. The wagons '
of the three evening papers went here and !
there, but not a copy was taken by the
boy?. The youngsters instead provided
themselves with small handbills which
they gave to their customers. The printed
proclamation read as follows:
THE NEWSBOYS' APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC.
The evening papers of this City, the Post,
Bulletin and Report, have combined together
to beat the newsboys out of their small profits
by refusing to check their papers. We respect- I
fully ask the public not to patronize these I
papers until they give the boys their rights.
The*e papers are rich, a few nickels do not
matter to them â to us it means bread and but
ter. Our mite helps us to support mothers
and little ones at home.
Help us by not patronizing the Post. Bulle
tin or Report. Respectfully,
The Newsboys.
Inquiry among the juvenile sinkers
broug'.it out the explanation that the !
three evening papers yesterday refused to â 
receive back the unsold copies and give j
return paper? of a later edition as they
came from the press. This the newsboys j
consider a hardship, as such a rule would ;
leave numbers of copies of an old edition i
on their hands and each youngster, if he j
wished to provide himself with a salable i
stock, would have to buy with cash at the I
usual rate of three papers for a nickel.
"They won't take our old papers bacK
and give us new edition copies for them,"
said Ardie Johnson, an intelligent boy '
and one of the officers of the Newsboys' !
Union. "They let their carriers have
papers at a cent apiece ana give the
restaurants all the papers they want at a
cheap rate, while they charge us 5 cents
for three copies, spot cash. Under their
new rule, which went into effect this
afternoon, we simply can't handle those
paper*, so we are forced to throw them
out. Not a single boy will sell a Post,
Bulletin or Report on the street as long as
their proprietors treat us that way, but i
we are selling the Oakland evening papers. I
Several thousand copies came over on the
ferry-boats this afternoon, and. as we get
them at three copies for 5 cents and check |
back to the agents, we do very well. If
the Oakland papers run plenty of San
Francisco news they will go here like hot j
cakes."
("There was nothing in it for the Post,'' ! ,
said Editor Hume yesterday, "and we j
simply had to slop. The boys alrased the
uriVilege and would take out more papers j
than they knew they could sell, and in a
short time would bring them back to ex- \
change for a new edition. This kÂ»pt our
presses working off thousands of extra
copies, which was a loss in white paper as i
well as the wear on the machinery. And, ]
moreover, the boys would go around '
among the saloons, offices and restaurants I 1
| and gather up the papers of the last edi
tion and bring them to us on the following
afternoon for exchange. We don't desire
to put any hardship on the boys,
but they must take the evening papers as
they do the morning dailiesâ pay for every
copy and only buy what they know they
can dispose "of. "Personally I don't care
for the street sales, as everybody who
wants a Post will buy it at the news
dealers, and the boys may go on with their
boycott. We are only doing what all the
newspapers of the country have done and
the plan has worked satisfactorily."
At the Bulletin and Report offices the
same statements were made. Mr. Bunker
of the last-named journal said the check
system was a nuisance and all three even
ing papers had entered into a compact to
abate it.
In the meanwhile the torn copies went
rustling along the sidewalk and the news
boys bunched together and howled their
indignation. The police would get in
among the little angry strikers and instead
of moving on they would surround the big
bluecoats and tell them their troubles.
Down at the ferries "Chick McCann
pulled along the strike in good shape.
With a bundle of Oakland papers under
his arm he kept the boys supplied, even
checking back what they could not sell.
"Gabby Jim," his lieutenant, made a
speech, and after swearing in all tbe boys
within the sound of his voice warned his
audience that he would break the face of
the first kid caught with a boycotted paper
in his possession.
One newsboy interviewed Congressman
Magnire at the office door of one of the
evening papers, and insisted that the Rep
resentative must stand in with the boys
and buy none of the boycotted papers, or
he would get no votes from the strikers.
The Judge promised.
Last evening the newsboys were enabled
to collect funds and had a procession with
torches and transparencies along the prin
cipal streets. They were joined by a large
number of Oakland and Alameda news
boys with Danners calling upon the public
to boycott the Post, Bulletin and Report.
A meeting will oe held to-day and effective
measures will be taken to keep up the
strike against those journals.
Charged With Murder.
Chin Kce Sing, alias An Wan, and Chin
Young, alias Ah Chung, were yesterday
booked at the City Prison on the charge of
murder. They were arrested at the time Gin
Lum Chee, the drugerist, was shot on Jackson
street, lie died Wednesday night.

made over the Detroit, Milwaukee and
St. Louis tracks. Trainer James McCor
mick did not arrive with the horses,
being still under the physician's care in
New York City. Sweet Favordale, one of
the stars of the string, who has been on
the sick list, was left over at St. Louis,
coming on later with Pat Dunne's stable
of horses. Charlie Thorpe and Eddie
Jones will do the riding for the stable
this winter. Clarence Waterhouse, one of
the owners of the stable, stated that the
firm was also negotiating for the services
rof Tommy Burns, a clever Jad who can
ride at 80 pounds.
J. H. McEvoy's stable pot in at the Oak
land track on Monday from Denver. Mc-
Light, Mary S and Captain Kees are the
principal bread-winners.
Bookmaker George Rose's string is now
quartered at the Oakland track. Arnette,
who won so many races for the Garden
City stable, will hereafter run iv the book
maker's colors.
William Godfrey will again get out the
programmes for the California Jockey
Olub, and Joe Langendorfer has secured
the same privilege lor Ingleside track.
The Baldwin stable of horses at present
racing in the East will not leave for Cali

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 16, 1896.
OAKLAND WILL
BE TABOOED
The Southern Pacific Pre
paring to Assume the
Aggressive.
It Intends to Build Up the
Peninsula and to Forget
the "Athens."
WITHIN TWO YEARS HENCE.
When the Shore Line Is Built Fre
quent Fast Trains Will Do
the Business.
The Southern Pacific Company is very
quiet about it, but the powerful corpora
tion is going to have an innings with Oak
land.
The story of the game is short enough.
Oakland took a hand with the Southern
Pacific, and now tie game is to be played
to a finish. At least that is what a promi
nent oflicial of the Southern Pacific has
stated, and he knows all that is worth
knowing in this connection.
The railway company is convinced that
it has been given the "glassy eye" in the
Athens of the Pacific. Young politicians
who get office across the bay faced the
railroad as a common enemy. What hap
pened is a matter of history. And now
tne railroad company intends to retaliate.
All of which means that Oakland is to be
tabooed in favor of the peninsula, that the
company is going to bend it 3 best efforts
to building up San Mateo County, part of
San Francisco County along its proposed
bay-shore line, and part of Santa Clara as
far as San Jose on the same road.
It has been asserted that the bay-shore
line will be built within two years from
now. As now projected this line will
havÂ«j a double track Irom Third and Town
send streets to Seventh street and thence
due south through the Potrero and into
San Mateo County near the town of
Baden, where the old line is met. Trains
are to run out of town at the rate of sixty
miles an hour to San Jose, and at fre
quent and regular intervals. Besides
cheap commutation tickets will be issued
to encourage men aoin^ business in San
Francisco to live in San Mateo County,
whete their homes can be reached in
thirty minute 3.
The railroad company has come to the
conclusion ihat its present ferry system
across the bay is large enough to suit all
requirements and at the same time to
please lhe management. It will suffice
2'or the accommodation of trains arriving
at Oakland mole, and also lor the local
business.
So the railway men say "Oakland is big
enough now, and we have all the business
we want out of there." '.They add that
they are tired oi Oakland. 0. P. Hunting
ton is tired of it, tired of people riding
free on the cars and going into the Su
preme Court to compel the corporation to
carry people for nothing; still more
weary of paying taxes that appear exorbi
tant when compared with taxes in other
counties.
When the bartender on a ferry-boat was
arrested at the Oakland molefor selling
liquor in Alameda County without a li
cence the railroad managers grew hot.
One of these things with another have
had a cumulative effect, and the company
is an adept at fighting back.
The old story about removing shops to
South San Francisco conies up repeatedly
with some new deal, which indicates that
ihere must be some fire to cause all this
smoke regarding the workshops. So far
as lhe project to build up a string of
town* and suburban residences aionÂ«: the
new line down the peninsula is concerned,
it has been vouched for by more than one
official. ______^______

JOSEPH JUNEAU, MINER,
The Aged Alaska Pioneer Tells
of His Great Gold
Find.
He Founded the Alaskan Town Which
Bjars His Nam:â Hire From
the ,Yukon.
Joseph Juneau, the old miner who
founded the town of Juneau, Alaska, is at
the ConKnercial Hotel. He arrived here
Sunday in the steamer Bertha fromj.he
mouth of the Yukon. This is tne first
time in over sixteen years that he has left
Alaska. He will remain in this City a
few days, and then start for Milwaukee,
Wis., his birthplace and the present home
of his only remaining relatives, three
nephews, also named Juneau, who are in
terested in a savings bank there. After visit
ing them ana viewing the scenes ot his
youth, the man who has spent nearly half
his life in Alaska will return to the placer
mines about Circle City, where he has
been almost ever since he left Juneau
nearly two years ago.
"How did Juneau get its name? Why,"
remarked the old miner as he interjected
in an easy, oft-hand way a few figures of
speech characteristic of the mining camp,
"I discovered it and the fellows just
named the place after me. It was like
this. I was the first man that went into
that country a-prosDectin'.
"That was 'long in '74. I found some
pold, but not much that trip. 'Long in
the summer of '80 I leaves 'Sitka with a
fellow named Harris, an Irishman, ana
we strikes into the country about Juneau
prospectin'. That was about 200 miles
from any settlement; Jeast that's what
they call it to Fort Wrangei and to Sitka;
'bout same distance to both.
"I was a-goin' 'long down a gulch with
my partner when, great God, I looked and
1 said 'See that'; aud rigut ahead of us,
not ten feet away, was a big hunk of
quartz just a-shinin' with gold. And
then we comes across the ledge standing
right up 'bout as high as your shoulder,
and straight-cut sides right along the nar
row gulch for 1500 feet. I takes a look at
the end of that ledge ana my partner
takes a look at a strip of what looked like
a band of silver three inches wide runnin 1
right through the quartz. I ups with my
pick and smashes a corner off tiie ledge,
and, holy gee, if that quartz wasn't just
tilled with gold. That's the great Fuller
ledge that's bein' worked yet.
'â¢Well, my partner and me did some
lookin' round to see if we had staked out
the best, and then we went after more
grub down to Sitka. 'Long in July we
made another trip to Sitka with some of
the quartz. When tbe fellows saw it they
just went wild and there was a stampede
for that country. On October 4, '80, I struck
the richest piece of quartz, I guess, that's
ever been found anywhere. It was about
three feet long and darn near half gold,
and some silver besides. Well, that's the
way Juneau got its name.
"They tell me now I wouldn't Know the
place, it's grown so â puttin' in 'Jectric
lights and sidewalks and a-gettiu' regular
streets and property worth three times as
much as was a year ago. Do I own any
thing in Juneau? No; that's tne way
with us old miners that's got somethin'â
we're always a-lookin' for sometbin'
good for some friend of onrs. That's the
way it was at Juneau. But Circle City
ain't a bad place."
LEPERS AT THE HOSPITAL
The TwentySixth-Street Pest
house Has Been Con
demned.
The Unfortunates Wi.l Hereafter Ba
Quartered at the City and
County Hospita'.
The lone-mooted question regarding the
fitness of the Pesthouse to shelter the lif
teen unfortunate lepers who are now lo
cated there was settled by the Board of
Health yesterday when the decrepit
Twenty-sixth-street structure was con
demned and the inmates ordered removed
to the City and County Hospital xuitil
better accommodations can be provided
for them.
The meeting was a special one for the
purpose of considering the Pesthouse
matter, and directly it was called to order
Dr. Morse said:
"For some time we have been discuss
ing a proposition to abolish the Pest
house. I think we have talked about the
matter long enough and we had bettor
take immediate action. For that reason I
move that the Health Officer be instructed
to take the requisite steps for the condem
nation of the Pesthouse, and that a por
tion of the City and County Hospital be
segregated for the reception and proper
care of the patients."
Mayor Sutro, who presided, at once ob
jected on the ground that a site for a new
hospital should be selected before the old
one was abandoned, and that nothing
could be gained by being in a hurry. He
said that the value of property, wherever
the hospital was located, would be de
preciated, and that it would be an injus
tice to change the location except to some
island in the bay where there was no dan
ger of contagion.
Dr. Morse said that the value of real es
tate cut no figure in the calculations of
the Board of Health.
''We are looking at this matter from a
humanitarian point oi view," he said, "and
the condition of these pour people must
be ameliorated.
"The way they are now treated is notta
short of brutal. I think the sooner we
make them comfortable tne better."
"Is it not possible to repair the build
ing?" asked the Mayor.
"It is beyond that," said Dr. Hart.'
"But what will become of the patients?"
insisted his Honor.
"The City will have to take care of them
as it has always done," said Dr. Morse.
'We can furnish them quarters at the City
and County Hospital."
The Mayor wanted the matter laid over
until proper accomodations could be pro
' cured for tbe patients, but the other mem
I bers of the board were linn on condemna
tion and the vote was in favor of such a
course. The tumble-down structure will
De vacated and torsi down at an early date,
and the City and County Hospital will
shelter the inmates until other quarters
are provided.
Cnief Market Inspector Ben Davis was
instructed to visit the City and Couuty
Hospital three times each week: for the
purpose of inspecting the food furnished
that institution.
In an executive session held after the
meeting the board decided to expend $500
in fitting up a chemical laboratory, and
the secretary was instructed to advertise
for bids for the construction of two am
bulances.
KISSED AND MADE UP.
Mrs. John Uernsiloii Deserts M.-r Hui-
bund and Babes for a Day.
John Bernsdon, 42 Turk street, called at
the Receiving Hospital early yesterday
morning. He had a baby about four weeks
old in his arms, and a little girl 2 years
old was walking beside him. He said he
and his wife had quarreled and she had
left him, taking with her a boy 4 years of
age. She took the little girl and the babe
to the stable where he worked and left
them there. He wanted the childien
cared for at the hospital till he could make
arrangements for them.
Last night Bernsdon and his wife called
at the hospital together. They said they
had kissed and made up and she promised
never to leave him again. They took the
two children away with them.
Numbered Seals Now Used,
At the suggestion of Special Treasury Agent
Moore, Collector Wise has provided all the de
partments under him with new seals and in
cidentally formulated certain rules which will
reduce the possibility of fraud to a minimum.
All the old seals were alike and could be bor
rowed by any inspector of customs. This, of
course, opened the door for illegal use, and
past events prove that certain inspectors were
not slow in taking advantage of the opportu
nity thus offered. The new seals, however, do
away with this to a great txtent. They are
numbered and given to each department as a
sort of trust. Wben an inspector or other em
ploye desires to use one it is charged to his
account and so remains until returned. iJy
this method (he date, hour and name of the
inspector, as well as the office from which the
seal was obtained, is always in evidence.
Under such a system it is hardly possible for a
ciime like that undertaken by Foss and others
to be committed.

THE POACHERS
AND THE KEEPERS
Not a Single Drop of Human
Gore Was Spilled
Yesterday.
The Aristocrat and the Plebeian
Sportsman Shot- Side
by Side.
DUCK-SHOOTING NEAR SUISUN.
The Launch of a Pleasure Party Blew
Up While the Crew Was
Taking a Dip.
Those who prognosticated a war on the
Suisun marshes on the inaugural day of the
duck-shooting season were sadly disap
pointed yesterday evening when reports
were received that not a single drop of
blood was shed, because the so-called
poachers were not molested to any ex
tent.
The Mallard Club with a full comple
ment of warriors, under the command of
Bob Boyer and his lieutenant, Bill Nye,
anchored its cruiser Rattlesnake imme
diately outside of a barrier which was
erected this year by the Teal Shooting
Club in Frank Horn Slough, which body
of water empties into the Cordelia Slough
and is distant about one and a half miles
from the drawbridge.
Half a mile south of the Mallard's head
quarters the McÃae and Myrtle gunboat
Toothpick is anchored. She had on board
twenty-five able-bodied duct-hunters on
Wednesday evening, -all of whom ex
pected to return last night with big bags
of well-fed game, bat the ducks which
they had longed for never came â that is
witnin range of hard and close shooting
breechloaders.
With the exception of three old-time
duck-punchers who understood the lay of
the land and the ponds in which quackers
quacked at early morn, the remainder of
the would-like-to- be successful sportsmen
returned early in the forenoon with empty
stomachs and empty hunting-coat pockets.
The day was entirely too fine for good
duck-shooting. In tno early morning,
when hunters could see just sufficiently
clear to draw a line of sight, some very
lively shooting resulted, but it did not
last long, as the birds vacated their feed
ing ponds at the first salute irom the
enemy and departed for the Sacramento
River.
The Mallard Club expected trouble on
Thursday morning, as two guards were
stationed under orders from (the Teal Club
within fifty yards of the so-cailed poach
ers' ark with instructions to keep a close
watch upon the sportsmen of "anarch
istic intentions," and to protect them
selves if necessary.
The keepers, or gillies, by which name
they are better known to the sportsmen of
Solano County, carried Winchester rifles,
and from ail accounts they would have
used them if a member of the Mallard
Ciub attempted to remove any portion of
the blockade which stretches from bank
to banÂ£ of a slough that is fifteen feet in
depth. The Mallards did not, however,
make any attempt lo remove the barrier
to navigation; but the boys held quite a
good-natured interview with the guards.
The president of the Mailards inquired
very particularly for the health oi his dear
old fri nd Mr. Whitney, who is presiding
officer of the Teal Club, and was also very
desirous of knowing the pond which Mr.
Whitney proposed to shoot over on Thurs
day morning, as he fancied that he might
join him in the sport.
"My only objection to the Teal Club
representative," . c aid the Mallard Club's
president, "is that he shoots a majority
of his birds on the sit, and according to
my old friend Bill Nye this style ia obso
lete outside of preserved territory, but
friend Whitney is old and consequently
excusable."
The guards informed the "poachers" that
they would regret their foolishness if they
entered upon any of the preserves, but
the caution was not obeyed as the ponds
in the preserves were surrounded and shot
over by "preserved" men and "non-pre
served" men bright and early yesterday
morning. Keepers stood alongside the
trespassers and scared the incoming ducks
away by firing blank cartridges at them at
long range. When a trespasser was an
noyed too much by this kind of play he
would seek the pond that was being shot
over by some club member and join him
in the sport. The "poacher" as a rule
then finished the day's shooting with good
results. â¢
In an interview with two of the Super
visors of Solano County, who were among
the sportsmen who took advantage of the
opening day, it was learned that the sea
son for the shooting of wild ducks will be
closed positively next month, unless the
preserve clubs cease to annoy the hunters
who go into the marshes for the purpose
of killing a few birds for their families and
friends. The people of Solano County are
very bitter against those preserve clubs,
and trouble will assuredly result this year
unless some understanding between the
hunters and the clubs be arrived at. The
Sheriff oL^the county was asked to send
constables to the marshes yesterday in
order to protect any possible destruction
to life and property, but he refused to do
so, stating in answer that the so-called
poachers did not require watching by his
men.
Three pleasure-seekers had a very nar
row escape from death last Wednesday
alternoon in Cordelia Slough. It appears
that Frank Happersberger, the sculptor,
Charley Barlage and O. Weisnian, propri
etor of a restaurant on Market street,
journeyed from this City last Sunday in
the gasoline launch Comet for a week's
shoot in tbe Suisun ma;shes. When at
the head of the Cordelia Slouch and
northeast of the Cook ponds the hunters
decided to take a rwim. and while enjoy
ing natatorial sport Barlage noticed a
strong smell of gasoline in the air, and he
immediately swam toward the launch.
When on board he essayed with a
lighted match to discover the whereabouts
oi the escaping gas, and la doing so the
gasoline became ignited and an explosion
resulted just as Barlage struck the
water in his endeavor to escape. The
young man had an extremely close call,
but luckily escaped any serious injury.
The launch quickly pot on fire and sank
before the eyes of the crew, leaving them
without a siitch of clothes. They lost be
sides their clothes about $300 in money
and two valuable diamonds, also two new
guns.
Tne launch was valued at $3000. In a
naked and despondent condition Hap
persberger, Weisman and Barlage man
aged to reach a farmhouse, where they
were given some clothing, and on their
journey home they received further as
sistance from Donald McÃae, whose hunt
ing ark is in the slough in question. An
attempt will be made to-day to save the
machinery of the craft and the guns.
RENDERED HOMELESS.
Mrs. Jamieson, an Old I.ady, Has Her
Furniture Taken From Her.
Mrs. Jamieson, an old lady who Kept a
rooming-house on Mason and O'Farrell
streets, had her furniture taken from her
yesterday afternoon by deputy sheriffs on
a writ of ejectment and carted to a ware
house on Market street. She was in arrears
for her rent and also in the installments
on her furniture.
Detective Anthony found her on the
porch of tlie houso bewailing her misfoi
tune. She told him she wanted to kill
herself, as she was without a home or
friends. Anthony took her to police head
quarters, and, as she appeared to bo men

AMID BEAUTIFUL BOWERS
Floral Decorations for the Two
German Garden Con
certs.
Carloads of F.owers and Evergreens
Beicg Artistically Placed in the
Pavilion.
At the Mechanics' Pavilion preparations
are going forward for the grand garden
concerts to be given by the two leading
German benevolent societies, under tne
direction of Gustave Hinrichs, on the even
ings of Saturday and Sunday uext, Octo
ber 17 and 18.
The idea to be carried out is that of an
immense garden, as suggested by the
name, and the whole place will be artisti
cally decorated with boughs and drooping
branches, while the glare of light will be
modulated by graceful palms and orna
mental trees. All kinds of cozy bowers
are being constructed in unexpected
places, and labyrinthine paths twine in
and out among the beds of beautiful plants
and flowers.
From Koster's ranch, down in the Santa
Cruz Mountains, has arrived many car
loads of material for the decoiation, pass
ing on its arrival here into the hands of
Messrs. Kolofrath, Otto and 'Dr. Bryant,
who are superintending the decorators.
The refreshment booth, which will be
situate i within one of the alcoves, will
s imply be screened from the concert-room
by overhanging flowers and ferns so the
music may add to the enjoyment of the"
tables. Numerous tables are scattered all
around â cozy tete-a-tetes and large family
tables.
The refreshment booth is under the su
pervision of the following ladies:
Mrs. B. Broemmel, Mrs. Charles Bundschu,
Mrs. j. 8. Bowman. Mrs. M. Esbarg, Mrs. S.
Goettie, Mrs. W. C. Hildebrandt, Mrs. I. Hecht,

WITHIN THE PAST SIX MONTHS TWO THOUSAND LIVES HAVE BEEN - MADE HAPPY
through the great force ot electricity generated by Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt. The sales
of this wonderful life-giver are increasing daily, as its marvelous effects upon the weak-nerved,
brain-fagged sufferer are becoming known. \
Â You who suffer should be guided by this fact; your neighbors all around you are being
cured by.it. No man should any longer deprive Himself of its help, because it is superior to
all other remedies. \ â¢ . - "*.â¢'; "
Every normal man has a certain amount of vital force when be reaches the age of man-
; hood, and if he loses this or part of it by excess or dissipation he must replace it or go into
; decline. No remedy except electricity gives back this force, and Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt ii
a certain means of regaining it. . ,â¢ : v;
Thomas Slattery of, West Branch, Cal.,' who has recommended the Sanden Belt to dozens of
his friends in that town, writes: "All the boys are well pleased with their belts, and yon will

Wnen the Sanden Belt cures after all else has failed it compels acknowledgment of itÂ«
merit. Nine-tenths of Its cures are made after the failure of ; other treatments. :
'â¢ Don't drug. It only goes to your stomach and poisons that delicate function.. If you are
weak you need STRENGTH, and- nothing else will restore it. Thesis no real strength in
medicineâ only a temporary stimulation. Electricity, every honest aoÂ£to,r admits, is the one
and only tonic for.the weakened nerves. You are worse after every dose. of drugs you take.
"I tried the best physicians in this State, ana went to New York for treatment and. trot no
benefit. I then tried this Electric Belt and it has restored my strength," writes Fletcher N.
Bun, a Los Angeles capitalist, on October 3, 1896.
; For real strength that will support you to a good old age you should wear Dr. Sanden'a
Electric Belt. It makes the vital pov.er as strong us the physical. Thousands of strong, mus-
cular men have no vital strength,. beSause of a lack of electricity in the body. This famous
belt will make the forces equal. â " v ' â . â ~> ' â '-' J if7^^j !^*^ a lrliWrf^llWllntllffi(^lW^W m^

Dr. San. leu publishes a book which lias a world-wide * reputation. It is called "Three
Classes of Men." He wilt send a pocket edition of it, closely sealed, free to any man who is in*

The circular of the Cutting Packing Company
says: !-â¢Â«â¢
CANNED FRUITS: Atricotsâ No movement
whatever during the past month, either domestic
or export, except shipments of early export con-,
tracts. Lomestic trade for season probably
lightest for many years. No inquiries, and quota
tions nominal. ,
Pkachksâ Little new . business except in stan
dard clings, seconds of frees and clings, water
frees and pie fruit. A good many inquiries, out
little result. Packing finished, but no determi na
tion of volume of pack or unsold stock. Doubtless
the pack as a whole is fully 40 per cent below an
average, but as sales of futures were mostly of
var-eties that were short, the carry-over Is of un
desirable varieties and Hie market therefore may
weaken.
Pearsâ No new business of account. Some in
quiries for seconds without result. As a whole the
uiarket is firm, as the carry-over is mainly ot
standard quality that is bound to advance in value
because they are good keepers and the low quota
tions make them * desirable purchase. No jobber
can afford to be without them at present values.
Pack finished about 20th ult. and is doubtless the
heaviest of my coast variety.
Pi.i-msâ AiKim .a- 50 pcr -cent nack. Little In
quiry Â»mi no business worth considering.
.-mai.l Frcitsâ An excellent demand. Prices
hardening and shocks are being rapidly cleaned up
at an advance. No surplus of any variety
Tomatoesâ Excellent weather: large crop and
of eooii quality. Too early to figure on volume or
pack. Considerable fiew selling at old prices. All
packers zea.ouslv working to exchange an old dol
lar for a cew dollar's worth of factory cost loma
toes, with no allowance for running expenses, in
terest, swell claim*, etc-
DRIED l-'RUi:S: Apricotsâ There is . very
little buyinz, for the reaso:i that the crop is prac
tically ou: of first bands. Fair stock is worth 7
cents"; choice out of the market and nominally
worth 8 cents.
Peachesâ An active demandâ speculative on
the part of a few shippers anil consumptive on the
part of Eastern buyersâ has sent the market up to
6 for choice and 6 to 8 for extra choxe stock, and
made apparent the fact that a considerable short
age exis s. We doubi. that there are over 125 cars i
left in first hands on this coast, most of which are :
being heid for higher priefs. â¢
Raisinsâ Weather has been very favorable for .
curing for the past ten days and most of the crop
has been picked; growers, selling con-rac s, though
based on a short crop, nave in most cases been
overestimated. The anomalous condition exists at
present of a weaker selling market in the East and
v much stronger an 1 higher buying market in the
raisin districts, where prices have advanced fully
V* to % cent per pound under an active demand.
Prinksâ Prices have advanced y a cent per
pound in the past thirty days, owing to a consid
erati'e demand: to-day 's market hern for 60-90 is
strong at 3' ... , \ '
SALMONâ Trade in spot transactions is of a
limite 1 character and in domestic dlstrioution
must, necessarily continue so until after the Presi
dential election. " ' .
The stocK of Columbia River fish has been re

In demand and prices on same are firm, while
Pink and lower grades are in good-supply and
prices on these favor the buyer and arc influenced
by the large quantity of fali-packed Puget sound

SHERIFF'S WIDOW
Mrs. Mary Pascoe of Grass
Valley a Victim of
Melancholia.
She Never Recovered From the
Shcck ot Her Husband's
Murder.
USED HER SOU'S REVOLVER-
The Death of Sheriff Dour'ass Re-
vived Memories That Unhinged
Ht Mind.
Oakland Office Pan Fbancisco Call,>
908 Broadway. Oct. 15. J
The widow of the late Sheriff W. H.
Pascoe of Grass Valley committed suicide
this morning while visiting her sister.
Mrs. John W. Mitchell.
About three years ago Sheriff Pascoe
was killed by a train-robber named Fred
ericks, who had attempted to rob a train
and had killed a brakeman named Bruce.
Fredericks made his escape and was handed
about a year ago for the murder of Cashier
Herrick of this city in San Francisco. Her
husband's tragic death produced a shock
Mrs. Pascoc
from which Mrs. Pascoe never recovered.
For some months past she has been sub
ject to melancholia, and it was for the
purpose of trying to break one of these
speiis that she came to this city to visit
her sister.
Mrs. Pascoe was particularly impressed
recently with the news of the kiling of
Slieriff Douglass of Grass Valley under
circumstances similar to that of her own
husband's murder. It brought to her
mind more visibly than ever the cause of
her grief, and she became more subject to
melancholia.
At the inquest this afternoon John Pas
coe, son of the deceased, said his moth
er's health had been failing tver since the
death of his father. She suffered from
nervous prostration, and frequently went
off by herself and cried for long periods.
He had frequently remarked to his sister
that he thought his mother wouli lose her
mind.
This morning his mother went into her
son's room and caressed him. She called
him "der darling boy" and said he was
"the pride of her lile." On a table in her
son's room was a revolver. As nis mother
passed out she took it and concealed it be
neath her apron. She |t once went to the
, back porch, put the revolver behind her
left ear and tired, and death was instan
taneous.
Miss Nettie iS. Mitchell, a niece of the
deceased, said that Mrs. Pascoe had suf
fered considerably and the doctor stated
tiiat she had a touch of congestion of the
brain.
Mrs. Pascoe was a native of Newcastle,
England, but has lived in Grass Valley for
many years and has raiseii a family of
seven children, all of whom lived at home
with their mother.
After the inquest the son accompanied
the remains to Grass VaiJey, where they
will be interred beside those of her late
husband.
SHE CANNOT BE FOUND,

nation to wed General Eugene de R- u

Orrrsby, "but very eccen ric, and cannot

who is now looking for her w.th a war
rant.
"She wanted a home of her own and
thought by marryiug she mignt ob am it.
Mrs. Coonradt left here about 5 o'ciock
yt-steniay afternoon, not morÂ« than two
minutes before her son-in-iaw arrived. He
was vÂ«ry much surprised to nnd her gone
and -eemed greatly di.->turbed. I think
she has gone to Stockton, for sue toid me
a day or two ago that she had come back
frpm there, as her children worried ncr
I so."
General de Beauharnais has declared he
has no intention of marrying Mrs. Coon

has been adopted requesting the general
executive committee to remove the restric
tion on out-going missionaries which
keeps them from making addresses three
months prior to sailing, as it is believed
their words inspire more work in the local
auxiliaries. A large number of interest
ing addresses have been made and reports
from local eocieties show much work is
being done.

entirely to the Chine c work. Dr. Mas

clash oi bis converted scholars and gave a
very instiuctive address illustrated with
the pupils. A quartet of Chinese sane in

ROOT IS ABSENT.
Big-Foot Gordon -f Gold Brick Fame
Given a Ten Years' Sentence.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 15.â When the
case of Andrew Root, the alleged assayer
of the gold brick swindle, was called this
morning before Judge Greene the defend
ant i! id not appear, but his attorney as
serted he would be ready for trial at a
later date, and November 17 was set for
the trial. There is a prevalent opinion
that Root will never ngain be seen in this
city. He is out on $7500 bonds, and it is
believed his friends woul 1 ratber have it
forfeited than have him take chances of
a term in prison. A single turn in the
gold brick scheme such as they made on
Banker Little of Dixon, would settle the
account.
Charles Gordon, alias "Big-foot Dave,"
th'- convicted partner of Root, was up for
sentence this afternoon. His attorney
withdrew tne motion lor a new trial, and
a stipulation was filed that the second
charge against h:m should not be brought
up within three years except on motion of
the D strict Attorney. Gordon waived the
rit;hi to an arrest ot judgment, as well as
all other legal rights.
Jud c GÂ»eene sentenced him to ten years
at San Qtientin, sayin _â¢ he believed Gordon
gtiiltv, Mnd that he had added perjury to
the first offense, and that there were no
mitigating circumstances.

Patronage.
Neither Revelry Nor Groans
Will Again Be Heard in Its
Noble Halls.
MANY YEARS A HOSPITAL.
Dr. Woolsey Has Tired of Payirg
Taxes on a White E epaant and
Ordered It Rezjd.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,}
908 Broadway, Oct. 15. \
The best-known landmark of older Oak
land will soon be raced to the ground.
Tae historic Walker masion, built by a
millionaire miner in the heyday of his
luck, and where the sounds of revelry by
day and night and the shrieks of maimed
railroad victims have echoed through the
spacious halls, is already dismantled and
the upper story has been torn to pieces and
thrown to the ground, to be converted into
kindling-wood.
Early in the '70's J. Walker, the
wealthy miner, built a palatial home at
Twelfth and Jackson Btreets. The Walker
residence set the fashion for what has
since become the most aristocratic section
of the city. For a year or two it was the
sCenp of notable banquets and social
events. It seemed to have been planned
for the purposes of lavish entertaining.
Like many other men of riches, who in
their decliaing years built large houses,
Walker was not fated to enjoy it. Para
lysis overtook him; financial crashes suc
ceeded each other and the Wuker family
passed from Oakland. Mr. Walker died,
and his widow now resides in a hotel in
Â£>an Francisco with justenoueh saved from
the wreck of a fortune to Etave off want.
The mansion passed into the bands of
Dr. Woolsey, who transformed it into a
hospital.
Railroad victims make grewsome work,
and weird stories of coffins being carried
in and out between sunset and sunrise,
and of stranee figures being seen among
the trees, gave the locality a gloomy repu
tation.
After the railroad ceased to patronize
the hospital, Dr. Woolsey had no use for
it, and for over a year it has been deserted,
only 'he bats ani memories and the watch
man's imaginary ghosts having access to
its interior. Some months a o a small
fire broke out in one corner, and then the
insurance companies refused to accept toe
ri*k.
Dr. Woolsey has already commenced a
new order of thtntrs for the neighborhood
by erecting a pretty residence in one cor
ner of the block. In a short time com
fortable homes will doubtless cover the
whole of the bock, and the coming gener
ation will know nothing of the varied
history of the bock in which they live.

TROUBLE OVER
A SIGNBOARD
Berkeley Unitarians Say
They Have Been
Tabooed.
Not Granted Equal Privileges
With the Chnstiao Bible
Seminary.
MUCH FEELING IS AROUSED.
One Allowed to Put Up a Sign on
Stiles Hall and the Other
Not.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 15.â Trouble is
brewing between the Unitarian society of
Berkeley and the authorities in charre of
Stiles Hall, with the Christian Bible
Seminary a third party in the fray. The
Unitarians are indignant. They gay they
have been discriminated against by the
Stiles Hall trustees, who refused them the
privilege of putting up a church sign on
the front of Stiles Hall, while they permit
ted the Christian Bible Seminary, which is
occupying the same building, to do so.
The Unitarians are wroth, because they
have been tabooei from exercising the
same privileges as another religious sect
which is holding meetings under the same
roof, and both are paying rent for the ue of
their particular portion of the building.
They consider that a slur has been cast
on their goodwiameby being thus tabooed,
and have risen to defend theirhonor and
to demand equal rights with other tenants
of Stiles Hall.
For the last two Sundays the member?
cf the church have ascended the stone
steps leading to the vestibule of the hall
and have been confronted with the huge
gilt-lettered sign, "Berkeley Bible Sem
inary," which is nailed to one of the pil
lars of the northwest wing. The sn-ht of
this tign brought back to their memories
the time, about a year and a half ago,
when the trustees requested the Uni
tarians in a quiet way to remove their
newly painted sign, which had been up
lot only a few days>. The thoughts of these
things have br-en rank, mg in the breasts
of the Unitarians and the.v are now prepar
ing to demand an explanation or a return
ot their si. ingle.
Rev. Dr. Edward B. Payne, pastor of the
Unitarian Society, said to-day: "Yes, we
have been decidedly discriminated against.
We nave been paying the trustees of Stiles
Hall $300 a year since March, 1895, for the
use oi the upper auditorium oi the build
ing as a place tor holding our regular Sun
day services. When we became tenants of
the building we supposed that we would
be treated as such, and accordingly put up
a small, neat sign, calling attention to the
fact that setvices of the Unitarian Chnrch
were held within. The sun had been there
for only a short time when we were re-
I quested to remove it, as there bad been
; some talk on the outside about putting a
I university building to the use of church
denominations.
"Ail this time, however, we were per
mit 'en" to continue our serv ces, and the
authorities not for once reiused the rent
when it came due. We were allow* d to
i hold our meetings just the same, but were
not permitted to have a few words
lacked up on the building to guide tin
buanger. We took down the shingle, as
request d, have continued ever since with
out one, and have said nothing about it
until now.
"When the Christian Bible Seminary
peon.c rented a portion of the lower part of
the building a short time ago they at once
hung up a huge board calling attention to
the fact that they held classes there.
"We have since been waiting ratiently to
see if their sk'ti was to be ordered down
also, but it still bangs there. 1 claim that
the discrimination between the twoorgan
izat jus is unjust in the extreme. We are
both tenants, and are, according to all
reason, entitled to equal privileges, unless
under contract to the contrary. 1 suppose
the trouble lies in the fact that we are a
heterodox denomination and that the
seminary people are orthodox. Doubtless
the same old right will be brought about
again against us Unitarians, and the old
controversy as to the right of any church
to hold services in the university building
be again precipitated."

STRUCK A ROLLER.
An Accident Whre the Trolley-Car
Wat Injured.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 15.â Car 11 of the
Haywards electric road, due here at 8:45
o'clock, collided with a heavy rockroller
on East Fourteenth street, near Fruitvale
avenue, yesterday morning, and was quite
badly damaged. The front end was stove
in and the glass all shattered. Fortu
nately all the passengers escaped un
harmed, except a little girl, who was
burned by the electricity, and a boy whose
head was cut by broken glass.
The track was blocked for nearly two
hours, and it required eight horses to tret
the car out of the way. The officers of the
road say it was accidental, the roller being
turned suddenly too close to the track.

MUSTERS OFF
FOR AUSTRALIA
The Visiting Giants End
Their Match With
California.
It Resulted in a Virtual
Thrashing for the Local
Players.
BIG BOWLING AND FIELDING
Keeling of Lake County Made the
B -st Stand for the California
Eighteen-
The great Australia-California cricket
match ai the Presidio ground came to an
end yesterday. Time prevented it being
played to an actual finish and made of it a
technical draw. But since the Californias
had but one more wicket to fall to com
plete two innings which together had
netted them less than the one essay of the
visitors the virtual result was most de
cisive.
Owing partly to the chilly weather and
partly to a report that the game would
close early, the attendance on the grounds
was considerably smaller than on Wednes
day.
The California eighteen completed their
first innings before lunch, making hardly
any stand before the consummate bowling
and amassing the modest score of 43.
Following on they did a trifle oetter.
Keeling of Lake County played an ex
cellent innings of 16. He was the one
man of the eighteen to score double fig
ures, though the honor was almost shared
by Bowhili, the Bohemian. Hogue of the
Alameda Club also made a creditable
stand. Th 1 visitors' play was absolutely
perfect and was a revelation to most of
their opponents.
At the conclusion of the match the con
querors drove to their hotel and thence to
the Mariposa, on which they departed for
their home amid the cheers and congratu
lations of their friends.
Yesterday's Play.

EDWARD T. HICKS KILLED BY J. A. MITCHELL
The Fatal Bullet Pierced
the Young Detective's
Heart.
He Had Predicted That He
Would Soon Die a Violent
Death.
BAD DEBTS THE CAUSE OF THE
TRAGEDY.
A Woman Claiming to B3 the De
ceased's Widow Causes an
Exciting Scene.
Joseph A. Mitchell, a young attorney,
shot Private Detective E. T. Hicks,
through the heart in - the building 927
Market street yesterday afternoon.
Mitchell ana his partner Jonn F. Mul
len, occupy room 610 on the sixth floor of
the building, and Hicks occupied a room
in the rear, the two rooms communicating
with each other. Mitchell and Hicks had
business dealings, the former attending to
any legai matters that arose from the de
tective's clients.
Hicks had a grievance against Mitchell
and had threatened to kill him. Yester
day morning aoout 10 o'clock Hicks and
Mitchell had a quarrel, Hicks using strong
language that shocked Mrs. Mason,
Mitchell's stenographer. An hour later
Hicks called Mitchell into his room. Hicks
closSd the door and the window, which
had been open. Joseph Silva and another
client of Mitchell's and the stenographer
were in his room, Mullen having left a
few minutes before. They heard loud and
angry voices proceeding from Hicks' room,
followed by noises as if a struggle was go
ing on.
A.. S. Grant, whose room adjoins Hicks',
heard Hicks say, "Let go of my throat,"
and Mitchell reply, "No, I won't." Then
he heara a gurgling sound, and quietness
followed.
Mitchell came out of Hicks' room with
bis face covered with blood. He said
Hicks had struck him with brass knuckles.
There was a cut and a big lump over his
right eye and a long cut on his forehead.
Mitchell made the remark to Silva, "I'll
advertise him well for this. I'll have him
arrested." Silva asked him what Hicks
had done with the brass knuckles and
Mitchell replied that he had put tnem in
his pocket.
Hicks left his room by a side entrance
ana Mitchell washed the blood from his
face and hands in the lavatory. The wall
of Hicks' room near the door leading into
the attorney's room and the wainscoting
were spotted with blood and there was a
pool of blood on the floor where Mitchell
had been standing when struck by Hicks.
Mitchell left his office in a few moments
to go to a doctor to get 'the wounds on his
face stitched and dressed. As the elevator
reached the ground floor Hicks was stand
ing there waiting for it to go back to his
offices. As Mitchell stepped out of the
elevator, C. K. Farnham. who runs the
elevator, heard Hicks say to Mitchell,
"You can have some more if you want it."
Mitchell made no reply, but walked away.
Hicks' shirt front was marked with blood,
and one side of his coat was covered with
dust.
About 20 minutes past 2 o'clock Mitchell
and Hicks were alone in the office. The
quarrel of the morning was renewed, but
Mitchell had armed Himself with a re
volver. They both came out into the cor
ridor, Mitchell ahead. Mitchell wheeled
round, and, just as Hicks stepped out of
the door, he hred a shot at him. Hicks
mechanically ducked his head, and the
bullet passed through his hat and lodged
in the jamb of the door, close to the wall.
J. B. Warren, who occupies room 614,
heard tne snot and oponed his door.
Hicks was facing Mitchell, who was stand
ing near the elevator with the revolver in
his hand, and as Warren looked out Hicks
backed toward him. Just then Mitchell
fired another shot and Hicks uttered a
yell of pain. The builet had taken effect.
As HicKs staggered toward Warren's door
Warren closed it as he was in almost the
direct iine of fire and at that moment
Mitchell fired the third shot, the bullet
missing Hicks and striking the marble
facing on the walls. He was preparing to
fire again when Hicks threw up his hands
and fell on his face. In falling his right
hand struck the glass in Warren's door
and shattered.it in pieces.
Dr. G. L. i?itch, the occupant of room
618, heard the shots and when he opened
his door he saw HicKs prostrate on the
floor. He ran to him and saw blood issu
ing from his mouth. He turned him on
his back, felt his pulse and found that life
was extinct.
J. T. McCrossen and General Fried
rich heard the shots and saw Mitchell
looking at Hicks with the revolver in his
hand. Mitchell walked downstairs, and
McCrossen followed him. Mitchell had
nearly reached Fifth street when Mc-
Crossen met Policeman James CooK and
told him to arrest Mitchell for shooting
,Hicks. Cook arrested Mitchell, and he
quietly pulled the revolver out of his
pock s t and handed it to Cook. It is a
38-caliber, and three chambers were
empty.
Cook took Mitchell back to the build
ing and left him in an office on the ground

he went to the sixth floor to investigate.
He telephoned to the Coroner, and after
getting the names of witnesses tooK
Mitchell in the patrol waeon to the City
Prison, where ne was booked on a charge
of murder. Mitchell was greatly excited
and nervous, and refused to make a state
ment till he felt more composed.
A. large crowd soon gathered in front of
the building and by tne time the Morgue
wagon arrived it had been largely aug
mented. It soon dispersed after the
wagon left.
Word had been sent to police headquar
ters of the murder and Detective Harry
Reynolds was detailed on the case. He
made a careful search of the rooms and
procured statements from Warren, Grant,
Fitch, McCrossen, Friedrich, Farnham,
the elevator-boy, and others.
J. B. Warren said: "I heard the lirst
shot, which seemed to be muffled, and it
struck me that it had been tired in the
office. I opened my door and saw Hicks
standing with his back to the wall close
to the door. Mitchell was standing near
the elevator lacing Hicfcs and Le had v re
volver in his hand. Hicks walked from
the door with nis face toward Mitchell
and Mitchell tired at him. As I was
almost in the direct line of fire, Hicks ap
parently making for my open door, I shut
the door. There was another shot and
the glass in my door was shattered by
Hicks' hand as he fell. When I aguin
opened my door Mitchell was looking at
Hicks' prostrate body and just then he
walked toward the stairs."
Dr. Fitch said he was attending to a
patient in his inner office when he
thought he heard a shot. He stepped into
his iront office and listened.
"As I listened," said the doctor, "I
heard two shots in quick succession, a
man crying, 'Oh! Oh!' in agony and the
smashing of glass. I opened my door and
saw Hicks lying on the floor on his face.
Blood was coming out of his mouth and I
turned him on his back. 1 felt nis pulse
and the man was dead."
J. A. Beeker, who has a store at 11 Sixth
street, called at the Morgue and imparted
to Coroner Hawkins information which
may be of benefit to Mitctiell. He claimed
to have met Hicks f ariier in the day,
when tho later declared that he intended
to kill Mitchell on sight. Hicks, however,
refused to tell Beeker the cause of the
trouble, merely declaring that he would
have Mitchell's life.
According to Mrs. Staunton, landlady of
the lodging-house in which Hicks resided,
he returned to his lodging for iuncn at 11
o'clock yesterday morning.
"Mr. Hicks was greatly excited," said
Mrs. Staunton, "and told me that he had
been having trouble with Mr. Mitchell
over the payment of the office rent. 'Mr.
Mitchell was in arrears for sev
eral weeks' rent and also for
a bookcase which he purchased
from me,' he said. 'I spoke to Mitchell
about the payment of the rent,' continued
Mr. Hicks, 'and he became very angry.
He grasped a chair and was about to hurl
it at me when I grappled with him and
after a short struggle wrenched tae chair
from him.' "
"I warned my tenant not to have any
trouble with Mr. Mitchell," said Mrs.
Staunton, "and he told me that he would
not, but the poor fellow was murdered,
nevertheless.
Jars. Stanton, who claims to have been
engaged to Hicks, called at the

Morgue. She said that $10 of the $20
found on Hicks belonged to her, as well
as a diamond ring which the dead man
wore. Mrs. Stanton lives at 220 Eddy
street. Hicks has also had a room there
for some time past.
C. R. Farnham, the elevator man. said:
"This morning, between 11 and 12 o'clock,
Mitchell came down the elevator. He had
a black eye and his face was swollen and
red. As Mitchell left, the elevator on the
ground floor Hicks stood at the elevator
door and made the remark to Mitchell as
he lelt the elevator, You can have some
more if you want it' I did not hear Mitch
ell make any reply, and he went out to
the street Hicks cot in the elevator and
went to his office. As Hicks left the
elevator I noticed his coat and side were
dirty and his shirt covered witn blood. I
was on the fifth floor at the time of the
shooting and heard Hicks hotlerinp."
Mitchell was seen in the City Prison
last night. He was calm and collected,

but, acting under the advice of Attorney
Mullen, he would not make any state
ment as to the real cause of the trouble
between him and Hicks.
"1 shot him in self-defense," he said.
"He beat me in the morning with brass
knuckles till the blood spurted from my
face and you can see on my forehead
where he struck me. He tried to renew the
assault in the afternoon and followed me
out of the office. That was why I shot
him.
"Any one who is acquainted with
Hicks will know why he quarreled with
me. He quarreled with everybody. I
don't care to go into the immediate cause
of his quarrel with me. It will all come
out at the proper time.
"I first met Hicks about two years ago
in a business way, aud about eighteen
months ago he and I signed the contract
for the rooms we occupied. He paid his
share of the rent to the agent and I paid
mine, so there could not have been any
trouble between us as to the rent."
Attorney Mullen wa3 non-communica
tive when spoken to. He hinted that
Hicks had been hounding Michell and did
all lie could to injure him with his clients.
Attorney P. B. Naele Jr. spoke highly
of Mitchell. "I have known Mitchell,"
he said, "since he came to the City. He is
a Kentiickian, aud when 18 years of age
enlisted in the army. He served three
years, and then came Here. That was
rive or six years ago. He studied law in
our office and has worked himself up en
tirely through his own exertions.
"Mitchell is a quiet, inoffensive youne
fellow and good hearted. Hicks had been
for some reason or other doing every
thing possible to injure Mitchell with his
clients. He would take them into his
room and say bard things against
Mitchell.
"Mitchell was oq his way to my office
when he was arrested. His brother,
â Clement J. Mitchell, is also an attorney in
the City."
Hicks came into prominence recently in
the Winthrop case. He was employed in
hunting up evidence for Winthroi>'s de
fense and Mitchell was one of liis wit
nesses.
It was reported that Mitchell was not
the attorney's true name and that he as
sumed that, name after getting out of
some trouble. Mitchell gave a positive
denial to both assertions, saying that
Mitchell was his true name and he never
was in trouble before.
THE SHADOW OF DEATH.
Hicks Had a Presentment That His
Life Would End Soon.
For several days past Edward HicKs has
walked in the shadow of death. The grim
specter stalked by his side and the young
man was conscious of the presence. He
saw the inverted hour glass in the bony
hand and he saw too that the sands of his
life were nearly run.
This substantially is what he told his
sister, Mrs. William M. Gregory of 1728
Market street as long ago as last Monday
when he called at her home. In speaking
of this stranj;o feature of thd tragedy
Mrs. Gregory said:
"My brother had a presentiment of his
death and he was mentally prepared for
his fate. Last Monday evening Ed came
to our house, with some others, for me to
write for him. He was lauguing and
joking for a while, but snddeniy became
serious and said to me: 'Abbie, some
thing tells me that I am not long for this
world. I know my time is short. I have
known it for several days and I have put
all of my affairs and papers in order in
case anything should happen to me.'
"I was alarmed, for I knew that my
brother was of a peculiar nature. He
could take a sealed letter in his hand and
tell in substance what U contained, and
many a time he foretold by prophetic
power tbe coming of luture events. I told
him that he did "not look ill. although at
that time he was pale. 'No, I will not po
by sickness," he answered; 'I'll go
out suddenly and unexpectedly. I cannot
tell how.' I began to cry, but he put his
arm around me and laughingly said:
'Don't cry, Abbie. lam not dead yot.'
Mrs. Gregory is the wife of William M.
Gregory, who is with D. J. Reardon, a
dealer in diamonds and jewelry in the
building where the tragedy took piace.
She is firmly of the belief that the killing
of her brother grew out of Mitchell's in
debtedness for office rent. In speaking of
the probable cause, she said Hicks had
told her Mitchell owed him for office rent,
and always seemed annoyed when asked
for the money.
Joseph A. Mitchell and His Pistol.
"I never liked that man Mitchell," re
marked Mrs. Gregory, ''and I warned Eii
to beware .of him. My dislike for him
came in this way: My husband intro
duced me to Mitchell at a time when
Mitchell wanted to buy a diamond, and I
told my husband that if the man could
not pay my brother ior office rent he was
a very poor customer for a $100 diamond.
Whenever I went to the oiiice to see my
brother Mitchell would speak, but ne was
not very pleasant or agreeable in his man
ner.
"I went to the office the other evening
and asked if my brother had been there,
but Mitchell did not look up. I repeated
the question and he insolently asked who
was my brother. A minute later he said
that he was not Ed Hicks' office-boy. I
told Ed about Mitchell's conduct as we
went to the lodge. My brother said that
the fellow was in a bad mood because he
was out of money, and he added, 'Mitchell
must not treat my sister in that way
again for I will not stand it.'
"It was then that I warned Ed not to
trust the map. I felt that he was not my
brother's friend, but Ed only laughed.
Since then Mitchell and I never have
spoken. My belief is th,at ho and Ed had
a quarrel about the rent and the payment
for a bookcase my brother sold to him a
longtime ago and which was never paid
for."
vVhile speaking to a friend in the prison
shortly after his arrest Mitchell said :
"Don't let any woman come to see me.
especially Hicks' sister, as lam afraid she
might bring a gun with her and take a
shot at me."
Mrs. Gregory said she did not know
why Mitchell should think she would try
to kill him. She never had any such in
tentions.
Mrs. Gregory said that her brother was
born in Ontario and was 31 years of a^e.
His mother lives in Westminster, B. C.
Nine brothers and sisters of the deceased
live in various parts of the United States
and British Columbia. She is the only
one of the family living in this City.
Mrs. Gregory stated that she did not
know of any engagement between her
brother and Mrs. Staunton. She was
sure that such was not, the case, as her
brother confided to her all of his secrets,
and had he intended to marry Mrs. Staun
ton he would no doubt have told her all
nbout the affair. Mrs. Gregory and Mrs.
Staunton belong to the same lodge of
Rebekahs and ar.e well acquainted, al
though not intimately.
A ROW AT THE BIER.
Alleged Widow of the Deceased
Ejected From the Undertak
ing Parlors.
Late in the evening an entirely new de
velopment to the case made itself mani
fest. A woman calling nerself Mrs. Hicks
and purporting to be the wife of the mur
dered man created an excitine scene at
the California Undertaking Parlors, Geary
and Stock.on streets, where Mr. Hicks'
body had been removed.
She is a tall, angular woman, whose
face shows slight traces of age, and her
hair is sprinkled with gray.
She called at the undertakers' parlor
about 10 o'clock, accompanied by several
friends, and said, "I would like to see the
body of my husband."
Mrs. Gregory, sister of the murdered
man, was seated in the parlor, and when
she heard this remark she started to her
feet. She is a gentle little woman, and
not wishing to create a scene called her
husband from an adjoining room. Mr.
Gregory had seen the alleged Mrs. Hicks
before, and took in the situation at a
glance.
"Mr. Hicks was not a married man,"
said Mrs. Gregory, -'and you cannot see his
body; no, not until you can prove that
you are his lawful widow."
At this the friends of the purported
widow bolted from the establishment, but
she was not to be "deprived of her rights,"
and attempted to force her way into the
rqom in which his body was lying. Mrs.
Gregory protested, between her sobs,
against the woman's intrusion, and begged
her husband not to allow her to enter.
Mr. Gregory then told the woman to
leave or he would be forced to put her out.
In order to give his command weight be
produced a policpman's star, he being a
special officer. The woman made an
other attempt to force herself into the
death-chamber, but Mr. Gregory grasped
her by the shoulders and ran her into the
street.
She hurried around to the side entrance
and acain entered the building, but strain
Mr. Gregory grasped her. There was a
brief strugele, but at the end "Mrs.
Hicks" found herself in the street. She
looked around for her friends, but found
that they had tied at the lirst alarm of
contention.
Sup then took ft car and hurried to Cap
tain Lees' office and placed the matter be
fore him. He heard the woman's state
ment, but as she could not produce the
marriage certificate he told her that he
could do nothing for her, and told her to
call again in the morning and he would
try to assist her.
"Mr. Hicks was my lawful husband,"
she said, after leaving Captain Lees' office,
" and that Gregory had no right to eject
me from the building. Mr. Hicks and I
were married in California, never mind
where, and for a long time our certificate
hung on the wall of our rooms, Third and
Everett streets.
"It was framed, but ono day my hus
band, when he was angry (he was so
often) took it from the wall. He
mashed it into a thousand pieces and
threw it into the fire. I am his lawful
widow and will have my rights. I will
get even with Gregory in time," she'eon
cluded, and she evidently meant what she
said. _^_^_______
RACING POSTPONED.
The New Oakland Track Not to
Cpcn Until Octo
ber 24.
The winter racing season will not open
on October 19. Notwithstanding thelarye
force of workmen that- have been em
ployed on the California Jockey Club's
new track in Oakland, the officials of that
racing organization find themselves
cramped for room, arid in a letter to the
press through Secretary Milroy announce
a postponement of the opening of the new
course until Saturday, October 24, running
for a period of but three days, closing on
October 27.
Tiie Pacific Coast Jockey Club will then
begin ' racing over its Ingleside course
Wednesday, October 28, ana continue until
Saturday, November 14. Thereafter the
two clubs will alternate, racing for a
period of.two weeks at each track during
the winter season of 1896-97. This will
terminate each meeting on Saturday, giv
ing the horsemen opportunity of moving
their horses to ana. from the tracks on
non-racing days, an arrangement that
appears satisfactory to all.
Secretary W. S. Leake of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club was in receipt of a tele
gram from Captain Rees, who will act as
presiding judge at Ingleside, stating that
that popular official will start for Califor
nia October 29.
The racing string of Barney Schreiber,
along with the select few of the Westches
ter stable, arrived at Ingleside track from
St. Louis yesterday. The stars of the
Schreiber stable are Schiller, Aquinas,
Don Carrillo mid Sugar Foot.
Nothing can prevent Rilay Grannan, the
.noted phrnger, speculating on the Califor
nia tracks this winter, even though he be
under the ban of disgrace of the American
Jockey Club and unable to obtain admis
sion to the tracks under its control.
Such action in this State is precluded by
an act of the Legislature passed on March
23, 1893, which compels places of public
amusement to issue tiCKets to all persons
who tender their coin as long as they con
duct themselves with proper decorum. Of
course Riley cannot make book, but can
cause the cold chills to creep over many a
timid bookie as of yore.
Harry Kuhls, who will act as clerk of
scales at Ingleside, has written the offi
cials of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club that
the following well-known horsemen now
running at Latonia have signified their
intention of coming to San Francisco:
Tom. Griffin, Smith and Ferguson, Ireland
Bros-, Andy Godfrey, William Donahue,
W. M. Wallace. George Cochran, Thomas
Hums, Byron McClplland. T. W. Coulter,
W. M. Roller, McNaughton and Muir.

FOUND DEATH
AT THE CHUTES
Contractor Bell Fell Head
long From the Scenic
Railway.
Suddenly Seized With Heart
Disease Soon After Leav
ing Home.
SKULL AND RIBS CRUSHED.
Bell Built the Odd Fellows' Temp'e
and O'her Prominent Eiifices
in the City.
Frank C. Bel!, a building contractor in
San Francisco for twenty years, was found
dead arrd badly disfigured at 7:55 o'clock
yesterday morning under the scenic rail
way on the Cole-street side of the chutes
by W. White, an employe oi the cliutes
company.
Early the evening before Mr. Bell left
his home and tamily, at 1810 Green street,
to attend a political meeting downtown.
It is not known what meeting he expected
to attend or whether he.went there or not,
but there is little doubt that he was the
third person in a scenic railway car which
started on a spin around the elevated
tracks at the chutes about 9:15 o'clock.
Fercy Field and another boy were the
other occupants of the car, being in the
front seat. Young Field says that just
after they had rounded the second turn of
the track and came upon a level stretch
he noticed a pair of hands disappear
ing down tbe side of the car.
It was not remembered by Starter Jamea
Martin or the two boys whether the laat
seat was occupied or not, but when they
arrived at the end of the ride the boy told
what he saw and a search was made below
the track. No one was found. When the
body was discovered yesterday morning
theface was badly swollen, the skull was
crushed in and both legs were broken.
The body was removed to the Morgue, aud
the family of the deceased was notified.
Dr.H. Darakroeger,the family physician,
says that Bell was subject to heart disease,
and that he bad been treating him for it.
Mrs. W. P. Lenfestey, mother of Mrs.
Bell, said yesterday afternoon that she
and the wife and relatives of the deceased
think that he was_ suddenly seized by an
attack of heart disease, brought on by the
exhilaration and excitement of the ride,
and probably suddenly raised in the car
and fell overboard. He fell forty feet
down through the lower track and against
several cross timbers upon a pile of boards.
A cross piece at the side of the upper track
was broken, and as there was blood upon
it it is thought this is the first obstruction
the body struck. Bell may have been
dead, it is thought, before he struck the
ground.
The members of the family and rela
tives scout the idea of suicide, which was
at first proposed. Mrs. Lenlestey says that
Bell was comfortnbly well off, owned his
own home, was supremably happy in his
domestic relations, was not in debt and
that there was no reason for him to com
mit suicide. He leaves a widow and three
little children. He was alone at the
chutes.
Frank C. Bell was the builder of the Odd
Fellows' Temple on Market street, the
Centennial Methodist Church and several
other large buildings in the City.
The scenic railway at the chutes has
carried 90.U00 people since July 4, and
this is the first accident that has hap-,
penecf on account of heart disease or other
cause.
DENIES ITS CHARGES.
Clerk Sullivan Criticizes the Chroni
cle's Treatment of Him.
The following communication is self
explanatory:
To the Editor of the San Francisco Cert'â Sir:
lam a Kepublicau. I come by my Republican
ism legitimately. I have three uncles and a
cousin buried in front of Frederlcksburg and
a father, a cripple, made so while carrying the
colors of his regiment to the front. I learned
my Republicanism from him.
The Chronicle has chosen to single mo out
specially for the purpose of making me the
laughing-stock of my fellow-Republicans in
these articles. It first said that 1 offered to
pull off n prize-fight for the benefit of the Re
puhiicun County Committee, thereby endeav
oring to crfst ridicule upon myself and the
committee. Such an assertion I brand as a.
malicious falsehood, without one iota oi
foundation.
Then the same paper alleges that I am the
only man in the City Hall who has paid his
assessment. That, a so, I brand as a lie, pure
and simple. The writer of the articles must
have known that Prosecuting Attorney Mad
den and Warrant Clerk Benjamin of Police
Court 4, Clerk Morgenstern and Wurrant
Clerk Seaman of Police Court 2 and Warrant
Clerk Graham of Police Court 3 and others had
also paid their assessments.
We paid it simply because we feel that all
political parties. Republican, Democratic or
Populist, should have money enough to con
duct the business of the campaign without
going on the outside to beg for funds, it is
done by every party, as the Chronicle well
knows. Â» M
I have always understood that the chronicle
was h Republican paper, and notwithstanding
the fact that I have often neard people Of
nounce the proprietor personally, I have in
variably looked upon the paper as a friend to
the Republican party. Now] however. I have
made up my mind that in this campaign ai
least the best interests of me party are not
supported by the Chronicle. On the contrary
the paper has done and is doing everything
possible to disrupt the party. The Call, on
the contrary, is doing grand work for true Re
publicanism.
My father always taught me never to dis
criminate between class, color or creed, but I
am afraid if he were a resident of this City he
would insist upon his sons discriminating
against the Chronicle. Tim R. Sullivan.
United Labor Party.
Tne executive committee of the United
Labor party met last evening and adopted its
platiorin, setting forth that the party is com
posed of toilers of all classes ana declaring
against boss rule in politics. Special mention
was made of subjects of taxation, sanitary in
spection of workshops, public schools, etc.
Complaint was made that irresponsible per
sons have approached the party's candidates
for the purpose of securing money. It was
stated that S. M. Williams, tho general secre
tary, is the only person authorized to solicit
funds.
