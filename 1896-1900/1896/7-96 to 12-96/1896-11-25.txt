MISSION OF THE AERIAL SHIP
Will Probably Be Used to
Destroy the City of
Havana.
ITS DESTINY IN GENERAL
HART'S HANDS.
Interesting Details of the Powers
of the Mysterious Con
queror of the Air.
VAST FORTUNES IN EXPECTANCY
FOR ALL CONCERNED.
Oakland People Claim to Have Seen Intricate
Evolutions in Midair â Venus and Jupiter
as Fair Deceivers.
Ex-Attorney-General W. H. H. Hart now has charge of tne destinies of the air
phip, which has hitherto been under the legal wings of Attorney George D. Collins.
The reason for the change is said to be due to the loquacity of Mr. Collins. The in
ventor, who is said to be extremely desirous of maintaining his incognito, thinks that
Collins talked not wisely and too much.
General Hart admitted his new and mysterious responsibilities yesterday and
then made the sensational announcement that the airship was to be used in the ser
vice of the Cuban insurgents and intimated that Havana was to be the first point of
afacK.
While the new custodian of trie secrets relative to the aerial mystery states that
be has not himself seen the wondrous invention he expresses himself 2s contident
that it can do all that has oeen ascribed to it by those who claim to have seen it in
operation above the earth. He expects to make a fortune out of it for all concerned
within a few months.
It is now reported that the inventor is a Dr. Cathn, who was assisted in the work
of construction by Dr. E. H. Benjamin.
While The Call is not in a position to give it as a positive fact that a successful
airship has been constructed and put into operation, neither is it prepared to say that
the thousands of people who claim to have seen such a thing are mistaken. In this
â¢ connection it regrets that it has to call attention to two deliberate attempts of the
Examiner to play upon the credulity of the people.
One of these attempts was made in Oakland on Monday and another boax was
attempted in this City last night. Both were feeble and ineffective, and acted only
as boomerangs on that "Monarch of the Fakers."
Considerable excitement was createa in this City last night by the mistaken idea
that got abroad that the airship was visible. The peculiar flight of Venus across the
western horizon and the brilliant reflection from Jupiter in the east caused this false
impression.
Oakland again contributes an interesting chapter to the aerial history of the past
week. Among other things it is asserted that the airship was seen performing
intricate evolutions in midair.
All the secrets of the mysterious airship are now in the hands of ex- Attorney-
General W. H. 11. Hart. The responsibility of their keeping was legally transferred
yesterday from George D. Collins to that gentleman.
Mr. Hart spoke freely and fuliy of the machine, but declined to divulge the name
of the inventor and owner, its present location or its mechanism.
It was learned by a Call reporter irom another source, however, that the name of
the inventor and owner is Dr. Catlin ; that he was assisted in his worK by Dr. E. H.
Benjamin and George Applegate, and that the machine is housed within a short dis
tance from San Francisco.
Attorney Collins was visited by the airship inventor yesterday morning, and ac
cording to Mr. Collins' story, the latter asked to be relieved from anything further to
do with the aerial mystery. His client, he said, asked him to recommend another
attorney, and the result was that a visit was paid to the office of the ex-Attorney-
General, whose offices are a few flights higher up in the Crocker building. After a
short consultation the mysterious client was under the legal protection of Mr. Hart.
"General, I understand that Dr. Catlin, the inventor of the airship seen in various
parts of the State within the past week, has placed his interests in that wonderful
creation in your bands," was the first remark addressed to the new custodian of the
secret, of which the world is to-day anxiously and impatiently awaiting an explana
tion in detail.
Aft-r admitting that such a transfer had been made only a few hours before, the
ex-Attorney-General, without further preliminary, went on and made a series of most
astounding revelations in reference to the machine and its ultimate purpose. Tuis is
tis story, exactly as he told it:
"There are two inventions and they are very much aline. One was perfected In
the East and the other in California. I have been concerned in the Eastern invention
for some time personally. Tbe idea is to consolidate both interests.
'I have seen the machine invented in the East and I am convinced it will work all
right, and from what I have been told I don't see any reason why the machine in
vented in California cannot be worked.
"My plan of utilizing the invention would be different from that of other people
- in the w:iy of making money out of it. and in order to do so there would have to be
complete secrecy in regard to it.
"I have very little doubt the California invention will work. The whole trouble
in the problem of aerial navigation has bean a question of motive power. In this tliey
have the rieht motive power, which is without question sufficient to work tbe ship,
and that is by electric storase batteries.
"My plan of operating this invention requires it to be kept as secret as possible.
I propose to use it wholly for war purposes, and within the next five or six months it
will be put to the test.
"From what 1 have seen oi it I have not the least doubt but that it will carry four
men and 1000 pounds of dynamite.
â¢â¢Before it is brought into practical use, however, two important modifications
must be made. It must be so constructed that if it should be injured while over a
body of water and drop, it will float like a I oat. The bottom will also have to be pro
tected so that the cylinder cannot be penetrated by rifle bullets or weapons of small
caliber.
"Because we expect to use it for war purposes is the reason I will not give the
names of the persons who are interested in it. We don't want to be arrested as fili-
Lusters on the first trial of the machine.
"This machine will be tested in the neighborhood of San Francisco from time to
time. I don't expect to see it myself or even get a look at it. I have had a full
( description of it, however, from the people interested. I was with them this after-
L noon for some time.
"I believe it can be used co that the inventor and the parties interested can mulct;
from $5,0rj0 000 to ?10.C00,000 out of it in five or six months. . .
"fcour men or two men can operate it. From what Iknow of it, lam quite con
vinced that two to three men could destroy tbe city of Havana in forty-eight hours.
"This machine is being tested in California owing to the favorable character of
climate. There is one drawback to the invention, and that is that tbe inventor
cannot cause it to ataud sti!lj it must be kept moving like an arrow. Otherwise it ia

under perfect control. There is no doubt about this. It can be made to rise from a
dead standstill. I cannot go into details about its constractibn, b^J will admit that
it is of cylindrical shape, is baiit of aluminum and has win<cs| but,'* cannot tell you
even how many wings it has.
"I do not know yet whether or not an application for Â» patent has been made.
But if one bas gone on to Washington I shall try to witlidra%tt, as I do not think it
will be good policy for us to let the information that would thns be furnished become
public, owing to the purpose for which we first propose to use it. We would rather
make $5,000,000 in six months than $100,000 for fifty years.
"I am quite positive that The Call is right in what it has reported, but I can't
say, of course, whether this machine is tbe one that has been seen by the people of
Sacramento and other towns.
"Before the invention is put to a practical test as a war engine it will be remodeled
with tbe changes 1 have suggested, and the new machine wili be a combination of
both inventions."
"Does the inventor, your client^ sail on these trial trirs that are being made?"
was asked.
"That I cannot tell you, because I have not talked of this phase of the matter
with him."
"How much longer will these oxperiments in California continue?"
"That I can't tell, but probably until they become fully satisfied with the working
of the ship."
Over One Hundred Miles Covered
Probably the most interesting story told
of the mucu-talked-of airship comes from
one recently admitted into the inner circle
of confidence and who it is believed car
ries a little bunch of airship stock in his
inside pocket. It was only under a
promise of concealing his identity that he
consented to tell of what be knew of the
recent movements of the mystery of the
clouds. In speaking thereof, he said:
"One of the surprising features of the
affair is that the inventor has been able
to keep his invention away from'the pry
ing eyes of the public so long. As you
may suppose, it took some time to con
struct the ship."
"Where was it constructed?" he was
asked.
"Well," it is no use to keep that a secret
any more than it would be for a hen to
keep secret the location of her old ne*t
after the brood is hatched and away. It
was built not such a great distance out of
Oroville at the home of the inventor's
aunt. The statement of other parties to
the effect that the material wa3 brought
from tbe East and put together in tuis
State is correc'. Tbe men worked hard
for some time to get the parts together in
the right shape, and several sbort experi
mental flights were made to test the bat
teries and machinery."
"Then electricity is the power used?"
"Yes; one of the forces of nature that is
made use of. The ship carries a storage
battery. The hull is of aluminum. But
I must not ?ay too much about the thing
itself, for I have never seen it. yet. The
first night that it was seen by the people
in Sacramento was the first timo that the
inventor made a practical test of the
strength, buoyancy and speed of his ship.
"He started out alone, for, to tell the
truth, even his assistants were a little
timid about venturingoff the earth. Well
the doctor started out alone and went to n
great elevation, when be discovered that
one of the copper bearings was becoming
heated and be wanted to get nearer the
earth. He slowed up his speed and began
to come down, and as he approached the
earth he realized that he bad lost his
course to some extent, for he could not
clearly make out the nature of tbe coun
try over which he had been and was pass
ing.

BOSTON, Mass., Nov. 24.â The jubilee banquet and celebration of the Home Market Club in honor of tlje election of
McKinley was held at Mechanics' Hall this evening. A reception was held from 4:30 until 6 o'clock, when the dinner was
served. About 1500 members of the club and invited guests sat down. Senator Hoar of Massachusetts was among those
who addressed the meeting. He s^.id in part:
"It takes more than one day for thanksgiving this year. No private dwelling, no church, no ordinary building can
contain our joy. The campaign of strife, of dishonor, of broken faith, of sectional hate, of bankruptcy is ended as it de
served. The American people once more stand bÂ»f >re the nations of the world for peace upon earth and good will to men.
The flag which our father* left us and our brothers saved for us without a rent was banded down without a stain. It is a
good time for Union soldiers to celebrate. There is happiness ajjain in the workman's dwelling. It Is certainly a sad
thing to think of States like Kansas, nnd Nebrassa, children of New England, that great farming population wuere we
expect to find, if we find them anywhere, sobriety, integrity, steadiness, conservatism, the great communities where
churches a bound, and where the schools are the best in the world, should have lent themselves to this crazy attempt at
revolution and this passionate crusade of dishonor/

THE FIRST TRIP.
In a F6w Hours.
HOAR SAYS IT'S A TRUE TIME FOR REJOICING.
same appearance to a man high up in the
air, you know. At last he mnde out that
he was approaching a large town, for he
saw many electric lights, and in order to
be sure of his bearing and location be
eteered straight for the lights. He soon
recognized that he was close to Sacra
memo. To tell the truth he had dropped
lower than he intended aud the lights on
the airship attracted the attention of a
large number of people of that city.
'â¢The next morning an account of the
mysterious light in the sky over Sacra
mento was published in The Call. The
people of Sacramento made one mistake,
and that is they did not bear voices. It
was the noise of the machinery and the
hum of the wheels that they heard and
mistook for voices and song?. I have no
idea that the doctor either sang or talked
to himself, for he was entirely alone, as I
said before, on the first voyage.
"He spent thenightsailingaround in the
sky and about 3 o'clock in tbe morning he
landed In the barnyard of a farm situated
in one of the bay counties. He put his
airship into the barn and locked tbe door,
for he bad previously made arrangements
to that end. The ship worked splendidly
and behaved most satisfactorily. Of course
there were improvements to be made and
several changes were necessary. But
taken on the whole everything went
well.
â¢'This was the very first trip of the new
airship. Since then he has been out
nearly every night, so 1 am told, and as
be has not limited himself as to distance
the ship has been seen at night by people
in many localities. There, that is all I
am going to tell you this time."
AN INVENTOR'S OPINION.
Dr. C. A. Smith Has No Doubt That
an Airship Is Bel rip Tested.
"Have I seen the airship? Well, I can't
say that I have," said Dr. C. A. Smith, the
inventor, when seen in his office in the
Sprockets building last night. "But I
aave no reason to doubt that it is an air
ship the people in this City and other
ciiie- have seen in the heavens for tbe past
few niguts.
"I have been experimenting on air
machines for the past forty-eight years
and have invented no less than thirty use
ful machines, some of which have been
used in every State of the Dnion. I know
of its practicability as I have had a model
running through the air.
'I expect to have machinery ready for
business in the beginning of next April to
make a trip across the continent. It will
be 160 feet long from bow to stern and 125
feet cylinder. The main body will be 125
*eet long. The front end will be a cone,
as it is a scientific fact ttiata cone preterits
less resistance in passing through tbe air
than any other solid body. The gas com
partments will be in tbe upper portions of
the cylinder and cone, and after being
filled with hydrogen and acetylene gas,
recently discovered, they will be hermeti
cally sealed. Tbe sheet aluminum to be
used is lighter per square foot than the
oiled and varnished silk used in making
balloons.
"Tbe rear end of the ship will be made
like a frustum of a cone and the air will
thus pass freely back to the propeller,
which will drive the ship. In the interior
will bo a cabin for passengers 35 by 40 ieet,
entirely partitioned off from tbe gas. In
the bow inside of tbe shell will be a pilot
house, from which the rudders will be
operated and controlled. It will have
windows, so that the pilot can see in all
directions.
"A horizontal rudder of sufficient di
mensions will steer the ship up or down,
and a vertical rudder will steer it to right |
or left. Both will be on the stern. The
wings will extend the full length of the
cylinder and in flight will be used as aero
planes, like the wines of the larger birds, {
and in crossing currents of air they will
be closed. When in a light atmosphere,
too light for the gas, the wings can be
utilized to carry the ship up into the at
mosphere.
"There will be a wellhole in the bottom
for an anchor and above will be a capstan
on which the lope wili be wound. The
ship will land by deflecting the wings and
the horizontal rudder; the propeller will
drive the ship forward, the aeroplane,
wings and rudder steering it to the earth.
It will pass above a platform where an an
chor rope will be fixed, and the capstan
will then draw it down onto the platform.
"1 can get a Maxim enpine which
weighs 320 pounds and produces 189 horse
power. The ship will carry from twenty
rive to thirty passengers. I calculate that
the ship will run at a speed of 100 miles
per hour and perhaps more.
"As to light, we can have a storage bat
tery to give all that is necessary. The gas
will be inclosed in aluminum compart
ments, so that it cannot escape, and this
will insure permanent buoyancy, and. as
a consequence, absolute safety.
"I do not know who is the inventor of
the airship that people say. they see flying
through the atmosphere. When it is
placed before the public it will, I think,
be seen that it is identical with the one I
have described."
VENUS AND JUPITER.
These Celestial Orb? Mistaken by
Thousands for the Airship.
An amusing phase of the airship mys
tery was developed last night, when that
inoffensive planet Venus, sinking in the
west, was mistaken for the clipper of the
clouds scudding across the empyrean.
That the brisht light which excited the
curiosity oi many thousands on Market
street about 6 p. M. was nothing more
than Venus there seems to be no room
for logical doubt in view of a statement
obtained from such an authority as Pro
fessor Davidson last night.
Avoiding scientific details it will be
sufficient to say that the planet Venus is
at this season of the year almost at tbe
full, and may be seen any clear evening
after dusk traveling rapidly from east to
west until she disappears below tbe hori
zon.
As soon as the professor heard the story,
shortly after 7 p. m., he got out his tele
scope and had no difficulty in identifying
the supposed airship as an ordinary,
everyday star.
At 6 o'clock last nicht or thereabouts
tlie cry was raised on Market street that
the headlight of the much-talked-of air
ship was plainly visible at a lofty altitude
in the neighborhood of tlie Chutes. Ex
cited groups of men and women rapidly
gathered in every direction and all eyes
began to scan' the skies. Sure enough a
bright speck of light was at once distin
guished high in the heavens and at that
time seeming to be out toward the west in
a line with Market street. After an inter
val it was noticed that the light had
changed its position somewhat, moving
apparently west and north. Speculation
ran riot, but the consensus of opinion was
decidedly in favor of the airship theory, to
which the gradual movement of the light
seemed to lend a color of probability. A
few unimaginative ones were sufficiently
prosaic to sugee<t that the light was
merely the star Venus, but the majority
quickly scouted that suggestion hs absurd
in the highest degree.
It is safe to assume that Venus has been
acting just as she did last night for many
years past, but never before, as far as can
be learned, has she been mistaken for an
airship.
Nob Hill and various other portions of
the City also had their crowds of heaven
ward-gazers viewing the unembarrassed
Venus in tbe firmament. On Ca'lifornia
street hill there were the buds and beau
ties of society in elegant wraps and gal
lants equipped with lorgnettes, while near
the water front binoculars were brought
into requisition.
Later in the evening Jupiter, scintillat
ing brightly east of the zenith, drew the
attention of thousands in a similar man
ner. Some claimed it was the airship,
which had reached that position by a
circuitous route.
But those who had seen what they confi
dently asserted were the lights of the air
ship declared that neither of these celes
tial beacons resembled the lights that had
previously crossed their vision.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 24.â The mys
terious airship, or at least a big light that
was taken for it, was seen by a large num
ber of Berkeleyans to-night. It appeared
to be hovering ever the bay, and a large
crowd gathered at the corner of Center
street and Shattnck avenue to watch it
and speculate as to what caused the light.
The ship, or whatever it was, soon disap
peared without allowing 'any of the spec
tators to see more than a moving light
like that of a searchlight.
CHICO, Cal., Nov. 24.â Although dis
credited by many as being a hoax and a
phantom story, yet there are many people
who firmly believe in the airship. Last
evening about 7 o'clock a bright and
sparkling light was seen in the sky west
of Chico. The light seemed to be travel
ine with great rapidity in a northwesterly
direction. Many people living along Fifth
street were out with craned necks looking
at the mysterious -fire, and nil who saw
the aerial light will vouch for the cer
tainty of an airship
RED BLUFF. Cal., Nov. 24.â Fully
fifty people in Red Bluff are now willing
to voucb for the reality of the airship.
What appeared to be it passed a few miles
west of Red B.uff about 7 o'clock this
evening at an elevation of probably 2000
feet. In a few minutes it fell fully 1000
feet and all the time v;as traveling rapidly
westward. It finally disappeared over the
Coast Range Mountains, going in tbe
direction of Eureka. The light only was
visible and appeared to be about the size
of a good-sized arc tight.
FAKING OF THE FAKER.
Underhand Attempts to Discredit
the Airship Story.
Just as the theatrical audiences were
leaving the theaters last evening at 11:30
o'clock a balloon with a light attached to
its base shot up into the air immediately
over the Examiner's business office on
Market street. It passed speedily along
over Market street and attained an alti
tude of about 100 yards, when it r assed
over the buildings on Market street, oppo

POINT ARENA. Cal., Nov. 24.â About
as hopeless a wreck as was ever seen on
the Pacific Coa3t is the San Benito to
night, as her forward half lays listed to
seaward with her starboard broadside to
the shore and her after-naif stern to the
beach. Feus that measure the distance to
her mastheads and even higher and pour
down her funnel are leaping over her.
Her pilot-honse and other upper works
are going to pieces. When the sun sank
this evening into a tempest-tossed sea
only the firm bed that the forward half
has in the sinking sand prevented those
terrible seas from rolling her over and
over and casting her far up on the beach,
scrapiron for the farmers.
Scrapiron is all tiie steamer amounts to
now, and if the northwester which blows
a terrible sea into the bight in the land
where she met her doom does not abate
soon even the scrapirou will disappear.
The wrecker Whitelaw, which left San
Francisco Sunday night, gave her up as a
hopeless job and straightened away this
evening on the home cruise. A telegram
from Vice-President Schwerin of the Pa
cific Improvement Company called her in.
After the first excitement subsided it
has now been learned that the steamer
was a wreck thirty minutes after she
struck the shore. She struck bow on, and
every heavy sea that came m lifted high
her stern and dropped her nard onto the
sand ridge just where the water suddenly
deepens. She broke off amidships be
tween the boiler and engine rooms, just
abaft the smokestack, as cleanly as a
knife cuts an apple in halves. The after
half lies with her gaping rents to tt.e sea,
which rushes into the open compartments
with terrible velocity, threatening mo
mentarily to slip her open. The water
als>o rushes furiously into the interior of
the forward half, and with such a nor'
wester as has been bowing all day â for
there have been mquntu ins of water and
whitecaps since early morning â it seems
marvelous that she has held together so
long. When the clouds clear away mo
mentarily to-night the two parts oi the
wreck seem like mountains of spray.
Chief Officer R. Zolling and Chief En
gineer I. W. Wood drove down from Men
dooino this afternoon and arrived at the
hotel this evening. They came to look
after any bodies that might be found,
"For we have friends among the lost,"
said he. So far the sea has not given up
its dead. No bodies have yet been
washed ashore. Mr. Zolling is reticent.
He said:
"There is nothine more to be said that I
know of. You know it all. But it is a
wonder that more of us are not dead. Tha
captain has made a statement and that is
all that is necessary."
The steamer Point Arena, on her trip to
San Francisco to-morrow, will put in here
at 4 p. m. to tatce off Mr. Zolling and Mr.
Scott and six other survivors here â C.
Jansen, George Christopher, H. F. Ebn,
H. Jackson, N. Leyva and L. E. Foster.
She will have on board the other twenty
nine members of the crew, including Cap
tain Smith, who were taken off the San
Benito yesterday morning by the Point
Arena. The Point Arena is due in San
Francisco early Thursday morning.
Captain Smith remarked while clinging
to the rigging, Survivor Jansen says, that
he cculd stand the strain only two or
three hours longer. That was on Sunday
afternoon. About this time a happy
thought struck one of the crew. WatchÂ«
ing his chance, he rushed across the deck
between seas and seized an ax that hung
in cleats on the ship's side below the pilot
house. Others joined him, and together
they cut a hole through the bridge deck
into a storeroom below. It was warm in
the storeroom and there was plenty toeat.
The captain and others of the crew got
down through the hole, warmed them
selves and ate. Everyman made a trip
to it when he could. It was this lucky
thought and good fortune that strength
ened the then hopeless men and kept
them alive until the next morning.
Captain Smith was the last man but one
to leave the ship. The captain was very
weak and bad to have assistance from
above in getting into the Point Arena's
small boat.

here, Saturday night The Alcatraz was ,
loading lumber for San Francisco. A
storm signal having come up the coast in
the evening, the captain dropped his lioes
and put out to son for safety. He did not
lay very far off shore, and a short time
after midnight, he says, the San Benito
passed close to him and between him and
the shore. The captain remarked to his
mate at the time that if the San Benito
was off her course, or if she did not
change it, whether she was off it or not,
she would strike inside Point Arena.
CaDtain Walvig said he first thought of
signaling the San Benito, but finally con
cluded that she knew her business. Chief
Officer Zoliing. in a statement made here
to-night, said Captain Smith was in
clined to blame Captain Walvig for not
telling him where he was.
There are conflicting accounts here as to
the condition of the weather for a half
hour before and at the time the San
Benito struck. There are several survi
vors who have said that the weather was
misty, but that it. was not raining as thick
as sheets, but all say they didn't see the
Point Arena light. On the other hand,
there are in the little town of Point
ArÂ»na, perched high in the hills above
the wreck, a half dozen men and young
ladies who say that about 1 o'clock Sun
day morning it stopped raining, cleared
up and there was light from a full moon,
though the moon was not visible. This
was before the San Benito struck. A well
known rancher who lived on a hill five
miles from town and back of where the
ship struck, said that he heard the San
Benito's first wJiistie of distress, and look
ing out of a window saw not only the
ship's lights but the Point Arena light
There was a rehearsal that nii-ht in town

of the weather, the fact remains that while
it may have been clear on the hill it may
have "been thick down where the wind

at sea have been known to blow away in
five minutes and leave the sea and sky as I

There is only one chance in the San
Benito's crew from the iist already pub
lished in The Call. T. E. Foster shipped
in place ol C, B.anberg, and Foster was
the quartermaster at the wheel when that
heart-chilling cry, "Breakers aiiead!"
came with the command, "Hard over with
her!" but too late.
The wrecker Whitelayv, Captain T. P. H.
"Waitelaw, owner, ond Captain Leland,
appeared at the wreck out ot a mist to sea
ward about 11 o'clock Monday morning.
Her small boats went to the wreck, re
moving the easy portables from each
piece of the wreck, such as binnacles
compasses, charts, clocks, a chronometer
which was still ticKing merrily along, un
mindful of wreck or water; canned goods
and meats, cushions, tooichests, hawsers i
and a lot of other miscellaneous stuff, '
worth about $1000. It was risky business ]
boarding the wreck, even on the leeward j
side, wnn the seas breaking over her; but j
it was done, and without a sintrle mishap. !
In fact, the Wnitelaw's able seamen chased \
each other across the forward deck to th > \

and down on deck.
At 4 v. m. the Whitelaw put back around i
the point, intending to run into the small '
bay at Point Arena beiore dark. A heavy i
sou"caster came up with a heavy sea I
before she made it, and the Whitelaw stood
out to sea all nigtit iong for safety. CaD
tnin Whitelaw said to-night before leav- I
ing for San Francisco:
"We cannot save anything more in this j
weather, and after this northwester blows !
over it is doub ful if there will be any- i
thing in s ght to save. 11 nless she works j
down into the sand we might, with mod- !
eraie weather, save her engines. I never j
saw a wreck like that before; I never saw j
a ship that was broken in two so sharp, j
straight and clear. The seas that struck
her must have been terrible."
The San Benito has been left to her fate, '
and the list of the dead needs no revision. !
A careful recount and comparison shows !
the drowned to be, as announced yester- i
day: First Assistant Engineer O. W\ '
Scott, Second Assistant Engineer C. Con- j
don. Coal-passer C. Brown, Coal-passer i
N. Fiizgeraid, Messboy J. Sheeran and J. j
W. Wilson. They were all in the first and j
second starboard boats, and were unable !
to cling to tnem when they rolled over or 'â¢
to -wim ashore.
There is little left to tell beyond the ;
deed 3of heroism, and the occasion was I
not lacKing in examples of that true |
bravery which seems to be bred on the I
sea. The experience of Chief Cook Wilson j
is a notable example. On Sunday after- |
noon he was eeen to rise up in the for- 'â 
ward rigging and swing his hat in the air. j
The hundreds of excued people who I
thronged the country around heard him !
shout, but they could not distinguish 1
what he said above the roar of the wincf, j
wave and surf. Some of these people had !
been on their knees in prayer. Women j
wrunjj; their hands and became hysterical '
at the sight. Children wept, and, for that j
matter, so did strong men.
Wilson climbed down the ladder to the j
rail and swung his hat again. Then he j
leaped into the sea. He had a small line I
in his mouth and caught with his hands a !
piece of wood, for which he had ap- !
parently jumreJ. He cl mbed up and sat j
astride of it.
He paddled first as he sat upright and
then on his stomach. For every foot he
propelled the plank toward shore a cruel '
wave would throw him back three.
He gave it up, climbed tuck on the j
ship and up the starboard ladder of the
foremast again. He sat there three or ;
lour minutes, then he was seen to jump
up again and swing his hat and then '
danced. He crawled till he reached the
forecastle and there jumped into the sea
again. He had â¢ vidently concluded that
it was certain death to remain on the
mast while there was a chance for life in
the raging sea between him and shore.
Wilson paused one long moment more,
gazed.' aeerly shoreward again, swung his
hat and leaped into the sea. A huge wave
receding from the shore caught him as he
came to the surface, lifted him up and
banged bis head against an anchor chain,
and that was the last of poor Wilson, who
nrst tried to save his shipmates with a line
and then to save himseif. He was stunned !
and went down with both hands in the
air.
H. Fehn, a somewhat aged seaman, now j
being cared for at the house of Thomas i
Kenney, near the wreck, was struck by a
mountainous sea and washed from the
rigging. The w4ter from shore caught him
and hurled him back against the ship with
great violence. He was badly bruised and
nearly stunned. The waves carried him
very near the shore several times, only to
carry him back again. He was nearly
dead from exhaustion and cold when his
feet struck the sand. The exhausted sea
man fell forward on his lace, dug his
fingers and toes into the sand, clinging
with what feeble strength he had left.
The light surf carried him oat com
pletely Beveral timÂ«s, when Frank A.
Butts and another man whose name is
not known rushed into the surf at the risk
of their own lives dragged the exhausted
Fehn to terra fircna. He was saying softly,
"Please, God. stay with me; stay with
me, God." When he found himself high
and dry the seaman said fervently,
"Thank God," and became unconscious.
At midnight; tiie sky is bright and the
wind and sea are going down.
SAW A TINIGN OF THE WEECK.
Presentiment of a Mother Whose Son
Perished at Point Arena. ..
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 24.â Mrs. Frank
Dean of 1916 Pacific avenue, is the mother
of the messboy, Frank Dean Jr. of the ill
fated San Benito. Sunday night her
sleep was disturbed by a presentiment
that her son Frank was in a wreck upon
the ocean, r So strong was this that she
related it to her husband, who attempted
to laugh it off as a dream. As soon as he
dressed in the morning he secured his
paper from the door and then learned that
his son had been drowned.
"I dreamed of a shipwreck," said the
mother, "and I saw Frank in it. (I am not
superstitious, but it was so real that I
could not shake it off. A mother knows

SOARING BETWEEN
HEAVEN AND EARTH
Twenty Centuries of Effort
to Fly Like the
Birds.
From the C'assic Man of Crete
to the Mystic Man of
Oroville.
Flights of the Airship Toward the
"Central Blue"â A Bird-
Bicycle.
Ever since C 6 B. C. man has been trying
to follow the birds in their wanderings
through the air. He has tramped every
where on the earth's crust and in many
places under it and is pluming himself
for flights over it.
It is understood from an account â more
or less va^ue, it must be admitted â tLat a
flyer named Daedalus and his son Icarus
had an occasion to leave the Isle of Crete
;!Â«;j years ago witnout theii- passports.
They took to themselves wings one early
morning before the detective force was
astir and fluttered away. They got off all
right and while the oflicers were chasing
up a clew hea led straight for Greece, lijce
two horning piereons bound for the cote of
tueir birth. Daedalus skimmed along the
surface of the Mediterranean and kept
himself cool, but the boy was a high-flyer
and caught a sunstroke. The wax by
which his wings were stuck to his clavicles
was melted and he dropped into the Ica
rian Sea like a shotted duck. It is sup
posed that the fa:her alighted safely on a
shore that had no extradition treaty with
Crete.
Almost twenty centuries have gone
by between the times the man from
Crete and the man from Oroville â
or somewhere â took a flyer. It is
said, however, that during the fourth
century B. C. Archytas of Tarentum
made a pigeon of wood that flew quite
well by means of :v mechanical contrivance,
but the patent oftico contains no accounts
of his machine. In the year 66 A. D. one
Simon did some experimental flymz at
Rome, and was considered by the early
Christians to be doing business with the
devil. This is probably why Nero, who
was in tne imperial office at'the time, let
him finish his flight unmolested, which
Simon did till he fell and broke his neck
one day in the Forum.
In the latter part of the fifteenth cen
tury one Danteâ not the poet, whose
flights were only those of fancyâ had arti
ficial wings with which he flew over the
ciiy of Perugia until he beui one of his
pinions, and falling on the roof of the
Church of the Virgin, broke his thigti.
The first Englishman to go into the fly
ing business was a learned Benedictine,
Oliver of Malmesbury, who took the idea
of Daedalus as described by Ovid and did
considerable traveling around among the
skylarks until he fell and Ijroke his legs.
He said the trouble was he had neglected
to provide himself with a tail. Shortly
afterward Cyrano of Bergerar advanced
four different means of flying through the
air. First, phials niied wiih dew, which
would mount toward the sun ; second, a
great bird of wood, the wings of which
should be kept in motion; third, rockets,
which going off successively would drive
up the body by force of projection; fourth,
by an octahedron of rum ueattd by the
BOtt, of which the lower part should be al
lowed to penetrate the dense cold air,
which pressing up against the rarefied hot
air would raise the whole affair. He
probably died while trying to get tia theo
ries patented.
Francis Lana in IG7O constructed the
first flyinc machine, which is here shown.
The specific lieutness of hot air and hy
drocen gas being unknown to Mr. Lana
and his contemporaries he tried to make
his machine rise by tafcing the air out of
the globes. They collapsed, of course,
which frightened the inventor out ol
aerostatics for all time.
Finally Montgolfier got heated air into
his Dalloon, and aerial navigation took a
long forward and upward stride â or flight.
Man coula lift himself, but he was ever at
the mercy of the wind, which hurled him
around in the depths of space of its own
free will. Tuis was a condition to be over
come, so he went back to the birdsâ back
over the centuries to Dsedaius and his
wings. How do the feathered things navi
gate the atmosphere? was the query. Just
one hundred years ago George Cay lev con
structed a small machine consist inc of two
screws made of quill feathers set like the
sails of a win>lmili in two corks. By giv
ing this a whirling motion with a stringed
bow the thing was made to float grace
fully in the air. In 1863 aeration received
another impulse byLandelle's idea of a
machine with two superposed screws pro
pelied by an engine, the steam of which
was generated in an aluminum boiler. As
it could only lift a third of its own weight
it did no flying, and the patent was never
infringed upon.
Penaud in 1872 took the bat for a model
and made an aeroplane with elastic wings,
the posterior margins of which in ad
dition to being elastic were free to move
around the anterior margins as around
axes. These wings because of the re
sistance of the air twisted and untwisted
and formed reciprocating screws. When
liberated in the air this artificial bat
dropped about two feet, then flew for some
distance, gradually rising during its flight.
Professor Lilienthal two year* ago made
a number of successful flights near Berlin
with a pair of artificial wingg. By shift
ing his center of gravity relatively to the
center of resistance he gave the wing
surface any inclination, and waR able to
control his movements to a certain ex
tent. However the professor limited his
experiments to low and Bhort flights and
has escaped the fate of Icarus.
Professor TVellner, a few years ago,
patented a rotary sail for flying-machines.
The wheel or drum worked on a fixed ec
centric, anil the airblades attached to the
spokes had an oscillating as well as a
rotary motion. In the turning, the air
would be drawn into this canvas-covered
drum, between the movable blades, and
as a result of this rotatory-oscillating mo
tion the machine moved rapidly forward.
The inventor calculated that a 1600-pound
weight machine, with a 25-horsepower en
gine would drive it one and a half miles
ocr minute.
Last year a catamaran airship was pro
posed for the United States coast defense,
400 feet iong and about 50 feet in beam,
and having two cigar-shaped hulls. It
would be lifted by hydrogen gas and pro
vidfid with 200-horsepower engines an.
olied to two vertical propellers. It would
carry a crew of eight men, with provis
ions, dynamite bombs for the aquatic
ships of an enemy, coal and water for the
ensineÂ«, the whole to weigh 68,700 pounds
when ready for sailingâ or raiher flying.
Its estimated speen would be 35 knots an
hour. When the Government accepts the
plans, Mr. Scott ot the Union Works may
get one of those atmospheric oruisers.
The great flying machine of the eminent
gun inventor, Hiram Maxim, is probably
the most promising contrivance yet known
in the realms of aerostatics. Complete
with water, naphtha luel and a crew of
three men it weighs 8000 pounds, and
running at forty miles an hour with a
pressure of 275""pounds per square inch,
the engines develop 360 horsepower; the
thrust of the screws is 2000 pounds and
the lifting effect of the aeroplanes an i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 189(5.
wings, 4COO feet in area, is 10,000 pounds.
The inventor eschews the gasbag of bal
loons and ti e use of vertical screws for
securing levitation, and relies entirely on
the upward thrust on the aeroplane and
wing*, mounting at a slope of about one
In eight, due to the currents of air rushing
past them.
The method of launching this wonder
ful affair in space, as has oeen described,
is from a railroad track, along which the
machine runs to attain the velocity neces
sary to raise it in the air. To make a
start it is tied up to the indicator-po-t in
its rear and the propellers set in motion.
They are soon driving a living gale of
wind in their wake. When the pull of the
rope has reached a definite amount, say
2000 pounds, a hook is released and the
machine moves along the track. Present
ly it lifts itself bodily and sails away
among the clouds. When the machine is
perfected Mr. Maxim claims that no rails
will be necessary> as a short run over
moderately level ground will be- sufficient.
About the latest invention in aerial navi
gation is that of Rudolpn Kosch. The
apparatus consists of two pairs of wings,
fcjich rotating in a horizontal plane, but in
different directions, fo that turning the
upper pair to the left will cause the lower
pair to turn to t!;e right. Both pairs of
wings can be flapped down simultaneously
while being turned, and then they appear
in a combined rotary motion. The wings
can al^o be set in relation to the shait in
such a way that the iront eiige of each
wing is raised to any suitableangle around
a pinion of the shatt, so that the two pairs
of wings will appear and work like two
propeller-screws, one right andi the other
left handed. the blades can be moveu up
and down while being turned.
The motor of this apparatus is operated
by a man who sits in the saddle and turns
the crank-shaft by means of common bi
cycle pedals, causing the wings to rotate
while they are boi.ig flapped up and down
by Â»he handles. So \ytien the wings are set
like screwblades they will perform a wave
like motion snu.lar to the w.ng motion of
a forward-flying bird, the oniy difference
being that the bird's wing travels up and
down and forward while these move up
ant! down and around one center.
Kosch estimates that his bicycle-bird
will scotch along through the clouds
easily at the rate of 100 miles an hour, and
a not very vivid imagination may picture
the bloomer girl chasing the eagle to his
eerie in the sun at no distant dny. When
man gets the wings of a dove the angelic
age will be unon creation. In the mean
time the world watches for the man from
Orovi'le â or somewhere â to lift the world
into space.
MISSION OF THE
AERIAL SHIP
Continued from first l>aQt.
shoot into the air from the corner of
O'Farrell and Market streets are positive
that they discerned the picture of "Faker
Billy" on the alleged aerial ship, wheh
caused many people to crane their necKs
and cry, "Oh, there she goes!"
The balloon swept along rapidly and at
tained a height of at least half a mile
before it struck a new current, wben it
changed iti course and slowly drifted in
the direction of the AJameda marshes,
where in all probability the remnants of
it will be discovered by some duck-hunter
to-morrow.
OAKLAND. Cal., Nov. 24.â One of the
fnnnie3t stories in connection with the
airship was that told by a so-called
detective-reporter, who came over here
last night from San Francisco to create
some imaginary men playing with an
imaginary airship on Inspiration Point.
This individual came over about 10 o'clock
and boarded a Piedmont car. He asked
the conductor for his name and number,
and requested the carman to take a good
look at him so that he could prove he had
really been to Blair's Park. The detective
must have been of a very amateurish dis
position, for before he reached Piedmont
the conductor knew what his mission was,
and that he was connected -with the
American Detictive Agency, and that he
was working for the Examiner.
The conductor referred to is No. 13 and
his name is Crist The man who claimed
to be an Examiner repoiter was a large
man with a black mustache. On coming
in from Inspiration Point ho went straight
to the Examiner branch office, on Broad
way, find left for San Francisco on the
11:20 broad-gaug? train. His plan, as out
lined to a friend, is this:
He was to teli a story of having gone to
Inspiration Point, where he saw two men
who were working with a machine like a
balloon placed lengthwise, to which was
attached a light and some arms and an
apparaius like a kite. When the detective
reporter approached the two men were to
lun away and pack their traps with them.
The detective-reporter further stated that
he had been perfecting hb plans for sev
eral days, so as to upÂ»et The Cai-l'b story.
Conductor Crist said to-night: "I was
accosted by an individual last night who
wanted my name and number. I gave
him the latter when lie told me he was an
Examiner reporter. After promising me
faithfully not to use my name and saying
be wanted it to prove that he bad been
out to Blair Park I gave it. He came out
on the 9:38 car and reached the park at
10. He wanted to know what car he could
take back in order to catcii the 11:22 local.
I told him to get the 10:53, and 1 presume
tie did. He could have rcaohed Inspira
tion Point and returned if he hurried, but
as it was so wet and slippery I doubt if be
ever saw tLe point."
The Examiner amused Oaklanders this
morning by publishing the following:
Alexander D. McAvoy of. the American and
International Detective Agency, whose office
is iv the Hills buiMing in this City, last even
ing discovered the source of at least some of
the mysterious lights, perhaps all of them.
By quiet Investigation he learned that Blair
Park, In the northern suburbs of Oakland, is
the place of operation of two men who have
been hoaxing tne people of Oakland and this
City. lie stationed himself in the park and
watched for what he might see. At exactly
twenty-eight minutes after 10 o'clock he saw
rising from Inspiration Point, a high shelf on
the Piedmont hills, about 500 yards from bis
place of observation, an object kite-shaped,
about ten feet in length, with wheels like
little windmills. On the sides of the structure
were lights, and from it hung a Japanese lan
tern, red in color, and about one foot in diam
eter. It moved slowly before tbe wind. He
plainly saw two men on the point, and ac
costed them as they descended the path.
They told him that they were sending up ob
jects 6uch as he had seen to mystify the people
and to give them material for newspaper
articles.
The absurdity of the above can be appre
ciated when it is stated that at exactly
10:28 o'cloctc last night, and for hours be
fore and for hours after, the rain fell in
torrents, and a ''Japanese lantern red m
color and about one foot in diameter"
would have lived about half a second. De
tective McEvov said he saw the apparatus
"500 yards from his point of observation."
A man who could see through 500 yards of
last night's storm on Inspiration Point
would make a fortune in a dime museum.
A HIGH-SPEED WORM.
W. J. Kenney Furnished One for
an Airship, He Thinks.
There is no one among the watchers for
the mysterious moving light in the sky
who scans the skies with more interest
1
than does William J. Kenney of Kenney
& Payton. model-makers and bicycle deal
ers, 519 Valencia street. The raason for
Mr. Kenney's interest is that he believes
he is the maker of some part of the aerial
wonder.
Mr. Kenney's skill is responsible for a
contrivance known as a "ball- bearing
worm."
"A man about 45 years of age, wearing
a gray mustache and appearing to be a
professional man, called on me about three
or four weeks ago,' r said Mr. Kenney last
evening, "and laid before me his pans
for an unusually large and high-speed
'worm.' I immediately concluded that
he was intent on making an improvement
on the cyclometer, a bicycle run by a
small gasoline motor, and proceeded to
nil his order.
â¢'He explained that be wished the worm
and gear to be practically frictionless, and
I suggested that the journals of the piece
of mechanism be fitted with ball bearings.
He acquiesced and gave me the measure
ments, and we went to work. For two
weeks we labored on the worm and finally
completed it.
"Tne party who gave us the order failed
to give us his name, but appeared to have
plenty of money and paid one bill, $143,
without a question. He was very anxious
to have the piece of machinery completed,
and when it was finally done he took it
and left the store in a hurry.
"We have not seen him since, and until
all this talk of an airship thought nothing
more of the matter.
*'When the aerial wanderer was finally
seen, however, it dawned upon me that
the man who bought the worm was inter
ested in this airship and that my produc
tion was a part of it.
"To strengthen mv belief I had many
mechanical problems beore me. First,
the gear of the arm was too high for a
cyclometer and it wa? ju>t the thing to
compress air or run a small dynamo.
"In view of the terrific speed it would
produce it was worthless for any other
use. Lastly, the peculiar actions of the
man who ordered the worm have con
vinced me beyonr? n doubt that the ma
chine is now being used on this airship."
EVOLUTIONS IN MIDAIR.
Peculiar Performance of the Aerial
Visitor Above Oakland.
OAKLAND. Cal., Nov. 24.â Oakland
was beside itself to-night with excitement.
For over two hours a large light attached
to something was seen cruising over the
city toward San Francisco and backacain.
About 7 o'clock the report was started
that the airship was to be seen, and peo
ple at once began to congregate in the
streets and gaze at the heavens.
The excitement commenced when the
6:30 train from San Francisco arrived at
Broadway. While crossing the bay the
passengers had observed the strange
thing in the sky, and the interest in
creased with the number of beholders.
They watched the movable hsht, which
alternated between remaining stationary
and taking flights in the sky.
Of course many were skeptical and de
clared it was a brilliant star or possibly a
planet, but when they received visible
proof that it did not remain many minutes
in any one particular constellation they
joined the majority and agreed that, they
were looking at a veritable airship.
Soon after the arrival of the train the
strange thing was seen over Oakland,
south of Sixth street, and as it passed
across Broadway the street was crowded.
One of the most noticeable features of it
was the frequency witii which the light
was put out and made to shine again.
This was afterward explained by one of
the spectators who watched it with a
powerful plass and stated that he could
see the machine performing evolutions
which caused the light to shine in differ
ent directions. It did not appear to move
rapidly, but it was at a ereat height above
the earth and was somewhat unsteady in
i.s motion, which somewhat resembled
that of a ship in a seaway.
As it passed over the city thousands of
people saw it and were anxious to add
their testimony that it was a genuine air
vessel. Among them were Colonel Gar
rity. City Elestrician Carleton, George
Hatton, managing editor of the Tribune;
Melvin Holmes, ex-deputy Superintend
ent of Streets, and scores of others.
The mystery of the skies was watched
every foot of its coarse by curious thou
sands.
The aerial rover appeared to cross the
bay and hover over San Francisco for a
time and then return. While passing
over the city ttie light disappeared tor a
time and when it was aj;ain visible the
machine was over East Oakland. As soon
as it crossed Thirteenth avenue Deputy
Constable Robinson announced its ap
proach and as it went by fully 5000 people
turned out to see it.
"I am willing to make an affidavit that
I saw the airship," said Deputy Robinson
to-night. "There was no fake about it
and we could plainly see that it had a
motion like a ship. It wheeled around
overAlameda and then seemed to cross
over San Leandro toward Piedmont." By
the time it was headed for Piedmont the
excitement was intense. Proprietors and
clerks came to the shop doors; bartenders
left their beer pump*; ladies stopped
walking and directed their attention
heavenward; cable and electric cars
slacked up *o that passengers might peep
at the wondrous light.
At the Galindo Hotel the windows were
thrown open and guests appeared with all
manner of spyglassss and looked at the
traveling light. Sometimes they declared
that there were aeveral smaller lights
visible and that they could see a dark
object, but it was too high in the air for
any of them to detect the nature of its
wings or tail, if it had any.
At Fourteenth and Broadway a large
crowd gathered and grew excited as the
remarkable light cruised around and occa
sionally disappeared. The play of lights
causes many to think that the party who
was directing the thing of the night was
signaling to some one o$ the earth.
Everybody agreed that no tricks with
kites or balloons couid account for what
they saw, for the light was so brilliant
and powerful that to produce it a dynamo
of no mean capacity must be carried.
Melvin Holmes, ex-Deputy Superintend
ent of Streets and a man well known in
Oakland, leveled a glass at it and declared
it is an air traveler of some desc; lotion.
George Carleton, the City Electrician,
who is better known than almost any man
in this city, knows the name of the in
ventor. Carleton was taken into con
fidence by a friend of the inventor, and
be vouches for the honesty of his in
formant. Anybody who will doubt George
Carleton when he says a thing is true does
not know the man. Carleton told his
story this morning, but He kept all names
to himself.
("I( "I was pledged not to divulge them, and
I'd saw my leg off first," he replied to all
questions touching identity. "1 heard the
story l&<t night from a friend of mine, who
is also a member of my lodge of Masons.
It was he who talked with the man who
saw the machine, and I was told the name
of the inventor by my friend. As I under
stand it, the ship was made near Oroville.
The Â»nventor made an ascension of several
Hundred feet, flew off four or five miles,
circled around a few times and landed as
nicely as could be. This my frieud's
friend saw. Both men are reliable, and
neither of them have figured in the matter
before."
FredGattee of 85S Broadway, as soon as
lie heard that the machine was over Oak
land, rushed for his telescope and declares
that he distinctly saw the machine per
form conic evolutions in the air. While
he could not see the details he ir positive
that he saw it maneuvering.
Manager Jes^e Halsted of the Oakland
Theater watched the machine cross over
Oakland, and with a pair of opera-glasses
aa-tisfaed himself that he saw an airship.
The mysterious light of the heavens was
also seen last evening by Mis. E. H. Craw
ford and Miss Kate N. Bassett, a teacher
at the Harrison-street School. The ladies
after some hesitation told their experi
ences. "I went to my south window about
10:30 last evening," said Mrs. Crawford,
"to see if it was raining. I noticed a light
off in the south, and watched it because it
was the only light visible. In a few mo
ments it disappeared, and later came to
view asrain. It looked like the search
lights I have seen at the World's Fair and
in New York City. I called Miss Bassett,
and we both watched it for fully nfieen
minutes and until it finally disappeared.
"When first seen it appeared to be
moving away from us and gradually sank
until out of our sight. Miss Bassett said
it must be an electric liirht with a tree
waving in front of it, but t bis was not the
case, as it was too hizh, and then I looked
this morning, but there was no tree any
where near where we saw the light.
Neither of us saw an airship, but we did
see lights that we do not understand, and
shall take much interest in watching this
evening and for some time to come to see
whether the lignt is to be seen any more.
"Before I went to bed, about 11:15. I
agaiu went to the window and the licht
had returned and was moving eastward
slowly, but steadily. I could not tell how
far away the light was or anything about
it, but having read the account in the
papers concluded that the light must be
the same as seen by others in this
vicinity."
Dr. J. H. Buteau was another who
stood amazed as he viewed the strange
visitor passing through the heavens. "1
was at Seventh and Market streets this
evening," said he, "when I noticed a.very
strong clear light down near the horizon,
moving along in the face of the wind.
The movement was very steady, and it

for fully ten minutes. As it receded it ap
peared to go lpwer. but that would be
natural ir it was moving on a level. lam
at a loss to account for the display, as I
am incredulous regarding the talk that it
is an airship. It might be a light at
tached to a balloon moving in an upper
stratum of air. We could see it go behind
buildings and emerge later on the other
side as we watched its movements."
The mysterious mnchine finally disap
peared over toward Contra Costa County,
and before midnight all Oakland was
satisfied that it had seen the airship.
FAITH IN SONOMA.
J. B. Loser Saw a Mysterious
Rapidly Movlntr Brilliant Light.
SEBASTOPOL, Cal., Nov. 24.â The re
port that an airship has been observed
floating around in various sections of the
State has created widespread interest in
Sonoma County, and it now transpires
that several citizens whose integrity is
unquestionable have noticed the mys
terious cralt flying through the air at
night with a headlight as brilliant as an
electric flush.
J. B. Loser, proprietor of the Analv
Hotel at this plac\ gives a graphic
description of the vessel, and his story is
corroborated by the testimony of numerous
citizens both here and nt Santa Ro3a. He
says that while driving to the county seat
a few evenings ago he observed what
appeared to be a brilliant light in the
heavens. A few moments later the
dazzling object seemed to be less than a
mile away and then it gradually wended
its way in an eastern direction and finally
disappeared. Mr. Loser says that it was a
phenomenon such as he had never seen
before, and he thinks that the strange ob
ject was nothing more nor lesa ihan the
mysterious craft that hai been seen in
other sections, as it tallies exactly with
the description given in the papers.
SIGHTED TRIPLE LIGHTS.
A Rapid Aerial Traveler Observed
In Placer County.
BOWMAN, Placer ' County, Cal., Nov.
24.â The articles published in The Call
and other papers in reference to the ob
served mystical aerial traveler have
aroused great interest here. Several per
sons in this locality have been favored
with a view of the strange visitor.
C. T. Musso, a fruit rancher, and sev
eral members of his family affirm that
about four weeks ago and shortly after
dark they saw a singular sipht, which they
are now convinced could have been noth
ing else tban the much-discussed airship.
Mr. Musso says he saw "the prettiest sight
that his eyes ever viewed." It appeared
to be three very bright lights moving

haps 100 miles an hour.
A. H. Thompson, a painter, states that
at about the same time he 'saw a similar
sight, which he describes as being three
very bright and large lights appearing
about ei-ht feet apart, and the forward
one as being larger and brisnter than the
rest, and moving horizontally eastward
rapidly and gracefully.
Professor S. D. Musso states that about
two weeks ago he and his wife saw a simi
lar sight moving in the same direction
and with about the same velocity. He
feels quite confident that it was not a
meteor, as ihere were three lights appear
ing about seven feet from each other in a
direct line, the forward one being larger
than the other two. Tiie licht, he state?,
was different from meteoric light, ihe
velocity was too slow for a meteor, and it
was traveling horizontally as long as it
was seen, which was for several minutes.
SANTA ROSA EXCITED.
People Willing to Swear the Light
Hhd Huge Wlngrs.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Nov. 24.â The ex
citement over the airship has reached
Santa Rosa, and the presence of a bright
light in the heavens to night at 7:30 set
hundreds of people star-gazing. The light
appeared to be moving in a.i easterly di
rection, occasionally disappearing entirely
from view with a dult red glow, only to
reanpear more radiant after a lew sec
onds. It was impossible to see anything
beyond the light, owing to t^be distance,
but when it finally disappeared there were
many people willing to swear that the ob
ject beyond the liuht hod huge winga.
This licht to-night revived the rumors
of an airship invented by a man at Mark
West that was said to have been entirely
successful as f sir as the upward and on
ward direction was concerned, but it per
sisted in going off at an angle without
warning.
On Saturday night, just before midnight,
several reputable gentlemen of this city
reported seeing a bright light moving in a
southwesterly direction. It was first
observed about two miles southeast of
town, just above Taylor Mountain, and
seemed to come from toward the Sacra
mento Valley. It moved quite swiftly and
disappeared in the direction of Alarueda
County. This is vouched for by Charles
Winters, a well-known merchant, and
William Rohrer of the firm of Rohrer,
Einoorne & Co.
John Stump of Orr & Stump, a would- be
wag, and several otaers sent up a small
balloon with a lantern attached this even
ing, but the presence of the big light in
the east made his fake fade into insignifi
cance.
While it is just possible that the light
seen to-night was the work of some bold
aeronaut there was nothing visible to
show a balloon, and there are hundreds
who believe it to be the famous airship
that startled Sacramento.
SAN JOSE STARTLED.
Several Persons Claim They Saw
the Airship Traveling in
That Vicinity.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 24.-People in
this city were startled to-night about 11
o'clock, on beholding a bright light mov
ing rapidly in the heavens, and they are
convinced that they beheld the famous
airship. It was seen moving in the direc
tion of Gilroy, as was testified by Eugene
Barre, Dan Manning and Jerre Sullivan,
who are employes of the Sunset Telephone
Company. The light was of such a char
acter that the parties are convinced that
it was none of the ordinary lichta in tne
sky. About one nour afterward others
saw the same mysterious light moving
northeasterly very rapidly, as if it were
returning from the direction of Gilroy.
These parties, James Stanley and M. J.
O'Brien, are also positive that they beheld
the rapidly moving light of the airship.
DEATH OF EDWARD EDDY
tfaa One of the Heat Known Millionaire
Mining Mmn of Colorado.
DENVER, Colo.. Nov. 24. â Edward
Eddy, millionaire, aied this evening. He
was one of the best known mining men in
the United States who made millions as
an ore-buyer and mill-owner, though he
never was directly interested in mines.
He was born in Cornwall, England, 57
years pgo and removed to the United

FLOWERY SPEECH
Says the Election of Mc-
Kinley Is a Victory for
the Pec pie.
Interests of the Couatry De
manded the Triumph of
Sound Money.
Noted Men in Both Democratic ani
Republican Ran js Join in a
Lovi FeasU
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 24.â 1t was a
notable gatherins that assemblod at the
clubhouse of the Democratic Club to
night to honor ex-Governor Roswell P.
Flower for the good work he did person
ally in t!ie cause of Honest money and Na
tional prosperity. Among the representa
tives of diverse political elements present
were: Chairman Edward Lauterbach of
the republican County Committee, John
De AVitt Warner, former Governor Waller
of Connecticut, General Curtis, the Con
pressman-elect from St. Louis County, \y.
E. Curtis and others.
Robert B. Ronsevelt presided at the
guests' table, and on his richt ex-Governor
Flower smiled and looked complacent.
At either side sat Perry Beimont, William
D. Bynum of Indiana, Senator John Fox,
Governor Waller, Surrogate Arnoid and
Iseaor Strauss.
It was after 10 o'clock when the cigars
were linhted. Mr. Roosevelt, as toast
master, spoke in a humorous vein. Re
ferring to the guest of the evening he sa^d
that he honored the man who, having
ideas of right or wronjr, let people
know what his ideas were. Mr. Roosevelt
praised Senator Hill for the manful right
ha made in Chicago, but he added, depre
citingly, "Hill, like the chictens. went
Lome to roost," after the convention was
over. He then eulogized Mr. Flower at
length, hinted that the country would
hear of him in 1900 and tnen proposed the
hitter's health. Three cheers greeted the
former Governor as he rose to speaK.
Governor Flower bowed a moment, and
then taking up the thread of Mr. Roose
velt's toast said, "I would rattier be te;i
trred such a banquet as this than be Pres
ident." A howl ot delight greeted this.
Governor Flower continued:
Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen : The hearti
ness of your welcome leaves- me in no doubt as
to how your votes were cast on electiou day. 1
know I am among friends and political Jym
pathizers. If circumstances made some ot us
more conspicuous in lhe t>aiUe for National
honor it was not because of any more eager
Interest or more unselfish purpose. Tnere
was uo monopoly of patriotism in that con
tent and ati the heroes were not commissioned
officers. We are able to < elebrate a victory be
cnuse our cause appealed to the patriotic in
terest of every gooa citizen.
The deep, steady and strong popular sen ti
nient needed but slight momentum to uinke
it invincible. It was the quiet personal influ
ence of man with man uhich put heretical
ideas to flight and sustained the high stand
ard of American honor.
The victors are not the successful candidates,
not the Republican party or its po.iticinn, not.
the Democratic disbelievers In the Chicago
patform; but the victors are you and your
neighbors and every man vriiose heart glowed
with love for America and who sought to pro
tect her lair name from shame and shield her
r>eople from poverty ana distress which would
follow financial and indust.-i.-il disaster.
1 sail at (tie Indianapolis convention that
the reni issue of the campaign was one of
patriotism, and with that conviction I had no
doubt of the result. Bui the empiiatic re
sfonse of the people even more than justified
my confidence and made me prouder than
ever before of my feilow-citizens.
The character ol this victory gives it par
ticular seriousness. Glad as we are ol it.
proud as we feel over it, our joy and our pride
are not those which attacn to the usual
political victory. The test and opportunity of
patriotism did not die with the count ol "the
votes on November 3. The respons.Lliity has
pasted into fewer hands, but the necessity for
unselfish and earnest patriotism is as keen
now as before the election. From those who
have been placed in power to carry out the
mandates of the people's will may be justly
expected no slight recognition of the suiem:i
ity of their trust. We, whose love for coun
try compelled us on this occasion to sever
pmrty associations, can with propriety tÂ«ke no
iifticiai part, even were the invitation ex
tended, in framing policies of Government or
in enacting legislative measures.
Oar purpose was to save the country from
what we believed to be certain injury, and,
without wishing or assuming to contend for
the honors ot the battle, we mas' certainly
. indulge the reflection that but for this action
on the part of the Democrats who couid not
support the Chicago platform or candidates,
the Republican party womd not have achieved
a victory. T:ie triumph was clearly the peo
ple's triumph, aha whi.e pariisnns have beeu
iiitrus;ea wr.h the responsibility of victory,
the people will not expect those responsibili
ties to be assumed in a partisan spirit, or dis
charged with pirtisan purposes. Control of
i-xccutive anl legislative branches ol the Gov
ernment by such an overwhelming majority
of the popular vote does not menu popular
permission to use tin powers of the Govern
ment for partisan ends. The exhibition of
Kucn a spirit \vnui<t be a sacrilege on tue earn
est Latent oi ibe American voter and treuchery
to the patriotic p. edges made by the Republi
can candidate and his associates during the
campaign.
It is, therefore, to the new l'resident and his
f)olitical associates in Congress that we must
ook to give meaning qnd effect :o tiie glorious
victory which has been won. lam glad for one
to acknowledge frankly that no two men
seemed inclined to appreciate so keenly the
non-partisan nature of their victory as do the
men most directly intere;>t-ed. Major McKin
ley and Mr. llanna. I am proud to bear pub
lic testimony to the fine sense of conditions
and results which hÂ«s been displayed by these
two men, not ouly during the campaign but
siice the election. Their behavior and utter
ances have been In thorough harmony with
the spirit of the contest in which they were
engaged. Since the elcctio:i there has been
none of the usual partisan boasting and none
of the usual party supgesilons for perpetuating
power. It will be a matter of great congratu
lation if the note of victory can be maintained
at that high pitch. In the legislation which
is to be enacted the results of triumph will not
be lost it the endeavor is honest mid per
sistent to serve the people and not section,
class or party.
It cannot be denied that a large part of the
support that liryan got was due not to any
particular conviction of. the people on the
currency question ot to Â«ny other of the radi
cal planks of the Chicago platform, but to a
conviction which has some icundation for ex
istence and which, growing constantly during
a generation, has uÃturally fooud freer ex
pression during hard times, that the burdens
ot government have not beeu equally distri
buted. It will be the duty of the Republican
party not to aggravate that conviction by any
unwise or partisan legislation and to eradicate
wherever possible any just cause for griev
ance.
Independence or disregard of popular feeling
in this respect will encourage law.essness ami
dissatiÃ.'aciion among the people. The return
cf confidence and good times, signs of which
are now visible all over the couutry, will give
' employment to labor, and as distress is
alleviated or removed will take the people
away from alleged Government evils. But If
the cause remain it is ouly a question of time
when the certain cff.ct will become visible
once mere and the dissatisfaction and discon
tent which tollow will be harder to reason
wsth and remove than it was this time.
Prudence and justice, therefore, demand a
special care, lest lresh causes of complaint are
furnished by short-sigh'.ed, selfish and par
tisnn measures.
The two measures which will most promi
nently engage the attention of Congress and
the new President will be those relating to
the tariff and to the currency, and in these
matters J for one should like to Â«cc a marked
departure Irom the old methods of legislation.
It has been the custom for mauy years to in
trust the framing of a tariff bill to the Com
mitiee on Ways and Means In tho House of
Representativfs, to which are appointed men
not particularly fitted by business experience,
but men who have served many terms in the
House, or who are promiuentiu the political
councils of the party in power. And custom
has thrown the tariff, into politics, and has
made the framing of tariff schedules largely a
g\me of give and take. The results have been
bad, not only for the business interests of the
country, but for the morals of the country.
I would like to sec a Speaker broad enough,
brave enough and patriotic enough to cast
aside this traditional precedent, and, bearing
in mind the lessons of the last election,
select from the business men of both
parties in the House the members best qualified
in points of character and experience to frame
a revenue bill which would give satisfaction
substantially to all the people of the country,
and which would give revenue enough for
the support of the Government economi
cally administered. Approaching bo difficult
a task in such a spirit would disarm criticism
at the outset within j.cpulnr nppr.val, remove
political prejudice, quiet business apprehen
sion and piac* upon the statute books a
measure gem-mlly approved, and in a 1 proDn
bilitiy designed to give the country a pro.oneed
period of prosperity without the unsettling
effects of continual iutdJling with the taritl.
I would iilso like to see Â« Speaker b.ave
enough and broad enough, with the support
of his political associates, to adept the sume
patriotic course toward the solution of the
money question. That, while it may be a
more 'difficult problem, yet approached la
such a spirit it could be settled on n. basis
which would give renewed court lence in the
soundness of our money and drive away for
ever the most depressing, insidious commer
cial influence, the tear of an uusound dollar.
If the Republics party proves itself unable
or incompetent to Hffonl the relief which the
people demand, the democratic party, recon
structed, rehnbued with niÃh purpose and
appealing to public confidence, will be called
upon to take up the work and carry it to suo
cessiul teimination. â¢
To those of us who believe in Democratic
principles as enunciated by the founders of
our party mid sustained in substantial in
tegrity through a century ol National history,
it is a particularly sad reflection that the
party convention at Chicago, by surrendering
to I'opulism, incorporating new doctrines
among Democratic princip.es and by its un
reasonub.e action, alienated hundreds of
thousands of earnest Democrats from the sup
port of their party candidates. It would have
been a much greater victory to celebrnte to
night if the Democratic party, united and
strong, had been the Itaders in the contest lor
the preservation ol law, order, respect for
autuorlty and for the integrity of our money.
But \vi?'finÂ«l our party divided and defeated,
and only wisdom, cnarity and opportunity
can weld together the broken parts and re
unite now discordant factions into one
earnest, nufhminded and patriotic band, in
tent on serving the country s good and imbued
with a spirit of conservatism.
Whatever may be the lunctional trouoies,
or whatever the heresies which temporarily
have been put lorward as Democratic doc
trine, genuine Democratic principles will not
die, and no uarty can be so loyal to them
th rough years of successes ana defeats as the
party which has ik-iendcd them, Americans
constantly since the foundation of the Govern
ment.
The cause of the people, even if once be
trayed by the un- Democratic influences which
gained control ot the party organization, is
safer, in the long run. In the iianus of the
Democratic party than elsewhere. lustlnc
tively the sympathy of the Darty is uiih the
masses and its principles are in the line with
what all true philosophers have deemed the
soundest policies of Government. The coun
try's best welfare will demand in the future,
as in the past, the maintenance of those t>rin
oi'ios and the party organization will be re
quired to give them life and vitality.
Honest and cc momical government, no un
necer-sary governmental powers, equal and
just tiixainn, no special privileges, the largest
measure of ltberaity consistent with law and
order will continue to be fundamental Demo
crutic doctrines, needing constant support
and vindication. Let uÂ» not be discouraged,
therefore, over the outlook ol tne party. 11 lor
a time it seemed to desert the people's in
terests the desertion was unreasoning ana
temporary. It will not be repeated. No such
blunder will happen again. When the bitter
ness which that election contest has provoked
has died away, and people have forgotten po
lincj.l hostilities in the returning industrial
and commercial prosperity, Democrats will
come together and, lorgettiug the past, look
ing only to the future, will coalesce once more
on fundÃmentfil Democratic doctrines, in
spired Hnd equipped for long years more of
valiant patriotic service for tiie welfare of
their coumry.
The ex-Governor was frequently ap
plau led before he ceased talking.
Mr. Roosevelt then introduced Perry
Beimont, who spoke briefly.

tary Carlisle of the treasury; Secretary

NOT AFTER CABINET PLACES.
Meitlier Banna >Â«?â¢ l'roc'or ll ill Accept
a Portfolio.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 24.-A Herald
Washington special says: Senator Proctor
is the authority for the positive statement
that Mark Hanna will not be a member
of the McKinley Cabinet. The Vermont
Senator is not only close to the President
elect, but he is also a warm personal friend
and admirer of Mark Hanna. It was
while talking over the political situation
yesterday that Senator Proctor gave this
interesting information concerning the
political prospects of Hanna.
According to Senator Proctor the Presi
dent-elect and many of his most devoted
followers would be delighted if Hanna
would consent to take a place in the Cabi
net. Hannn, however, has no aspirations
in that direction, and therefore it is use
less to use his name in the speculation
over Cabinet portfolios.
While denying the Hanna report Sen
ator Proctor also took occasion to wipe
his own name from the Cabinet slate. He
has enjoyed all the glory that goes with a
Cabinet position, and he would not relin
quish his seat in the Senate for a score of
Cabinet portfolios.
In thk- connection it is also stated that
there is no desposition on the part of the
President-elect to attempt to influence
the Republicans in the Senate to pass the
Dingley tariff bill during the coming short
session of Congress. It is generally ad
mitted that there has been no material
change in the political complexion of the
Senate since the Dingiey bill was last con
sidered by that body, and therefore it is
not probable that sucb a measure would
be as strong with the Republican party
now as it was last winter.
Under the circumstances the Senator
says that he does not see that any prac
tical result can be obtained in the direc
tion of increasing the revenues at the
coming short se-sion, and there will have
to be a full, free coasideration of the sub
ject when the Republican party is re
sponsible for all tbt tranches of Govern
ment.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1896.
CUBAN PATRIOTS
ARE REJOICING
Think Weyler's Return
Means Abandonment of
the Campaign.
But the Captain-General Says
the Insurgents Cannot Hold
Out Much Longer.
While the Spanish Leader Rests in
His Palace the Rebels Are
Besieging Puerto Principe.
HAVANA, Cv b.v, Nov. 24.â The report
circulated by the New York World to the
effect that the men captured on the
American filibustering schooner Com
petitor had been retried by court martial,
despite a protest filed by Consul-General
Lee prior to his departure from Havana,
is absolutely without a word of truth.
Only tho preliminary examination of the
prisoners on their second trial, as ordered
by the Supreme Military and Naval
Tribunal in Madrid, has as yet occurred,
as was reported at the time by the
United Associated Presses. It is not
known when the trials will take place.
Every effort has been made to learn the
true reasons for the return last night of
Captain-Geueial Weyler from the prov
ince of Pinar del .io. All that is Known
is that he came here on the gunboat from
Mariel accompanied by only one adju
tant. The rest of his staff came by rail
from Artemisa.
General Weyler has made no official
declaration concerning the condition of
nffairs in the province of Pinar del Rio.
In an interview had with him just before
he left Pi.iar del Rio he said ha was satis
tied with his campaign. He had crossed
to the south and bad expected to meet
Maceo to give him combat. He had,
however, met only srcall bands of rebels,
who disappeared when the Spanish troops
came near to them.
When questioned concerning the where
abouts of Maceo General Weyler said: "I
do not know where he Is. It is certain
that I did not meet him in the bills or
delis of Pinar del Rio. Despite their re
puted bravado the rebels always fled on
the approach of troops."
General Weyler added that the supplies
of cattle that bad been obtained by the in
surgents are disappearing, the troops cap
turing and destroying all that they saw.
The military combinations planned by
him had resulted as he had expected. All
these combinations were not finished, but
there would be much less to do at the end
of the year.
The press comments on the return of
the captain-general are very good, as is
natural under the strict c&nsorship exer
cised here. It is rumored that he wjll soon
return to the field. One report has it that j
tne chief reason for his return to Havana '
was pressing Government business which j
demanded his personal attention. How- j
ever, nothing really definite is known, and
events in the near future are anxiously
awaited. Some dissatisfaction is quietly
expressed even by loyaiists that General
Weyler, after his long preparations to in
flict a crushing blow on Maceo, should
now come back to tne capital without
even catching sight of the main body of
the rebels. The rebel sympathizer- are
jubilant, believing that General Weyler's
return signalizes the abandonment of his
leadership of tho campaign.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 24.â Th* sym
pathizers witii the Cuban cause in this
city were very jubilant over the news that
Captain-General Weyler had returned to
Havana. Several reasons are given for
the general's action in withdrawing from
the field, one of them being that Marquis
Ahumada, who took charge of affairs in
Havana iiuring the absence of General
Weyler, did not properly conduct tiie
war. The Cubans all agree that Weyler's
campaign in Pinar del Rio has been a
failure.
Senor Estrada Palma, president of the
Junta, in an interview with a reporter to
day, said: "J think General Weyler has
disgraced himself by leaving the held, for,
although he had over three times the
number of men at his command that
Maceo has in Pinar del Rio, he has not
accomplished his avowed purpose to crush
the r vohuiouists.
"The information ba3 come to me," he
continued, "that the insurgent forces
under General Calixto Garcia have be
seiged Puerto Principe, t!ie founh largest
city in the island, which they now practi
cally control, has, I believe, had soine
thine to do with his return, for he is needed
in Havana to direct the entire movements
of the Spanish army."
STRIKE OF THE DOCK LABORERS.
Spread of the Dissatisfaction and There
Is Trouble in Loading Vessels at
Several Ports.
HAMBURG, Germany, Nov. 24.â The
strike of the dock laborers and others em
ployed in the shipping trade continues
and some of the ship owners and con
signees are finding it didicult to get their
vessels loaded or discharged. The Ham
burg-American line has advised intending
shippers by their steamers to send their
goods by way of Bremen. Antwerp or
Rotterdam.
The companies in those places which
belong to the Atlantic Steamship Associa
tion have undertaken to carry out all the
contracts entered upon by the Hamburg-
American Company, Similar measures
will be taken in the matter of passeneer
traffic. Ii is stated that the pooling ar
rangements guarantee the Hamburg-
American Company against pecuniary loss
trom a strike.
Tnere is no sign as yet of the differences
between the shipping men ami their eni
pleyes beint adjusted. The employers
are tirm in their refusal to grant the de
mands of the men and the latter are
equally as firm in their attempt to compel
tne employers to accede to their terms.
The movement threatens to spread to
Bremen. The snpDort that the sinkers
are rcceiviug complicates me situation.
Ship-owners and other etnpioyers of the
harbor labor have decided to r^-cmploy
any of the men who express a willingness
to return to work before Thursday at the
old rate of pay without the increase
granted lutely as a compromise. They
will not re-employ any ol the men who
refuse to accept their terms.
The strikers now number about 0000.
Work on the docks ana in the harbor is
almost at a standstill. A lnr^e number of
men who arrived from Friesland and
other places to fill the places of the strikers
relumed immedia'ely upon learning of
the position ol afr.iirs. Joseph H. Wilson,
president of the London Seaman's Union!
has telegraphed that the members of that
union will not discharge any vessels from
Hamburg.
BREMEN, Germany, Nov. 24.â The dock
laborers t ere have demanded an increase
in their wages and threaten to strike if
iheir demand is not granted. The ware
house company has announced that it
will ret'ly In three days.
LONDON, Â£xg.. Nov. 24â The officers
of ttie British Shipping Federation say if
any attempt is made to prevent the coal
me at British ports of steamers from
Hamburg, measures will be taken to re
place any of the men who refuse to work.
ANTWERP, Belgium, Nov. 25 âThe
executive committee of the Dock Labor
ers' Union here are having difficulty in
keeping the union men at work.
ROTTERDAM, Holland, Nov. 24.â 1t
has been decided by the Dock Laborers'
Union here to do no work on vessels to or

LADY TINA SCOTT'S TRIAL
Earl Russell Takes the Witness- Stand and
Denies All the Charges Made
Against Him.
LONDON, Exo.. Nov. 24.â The trial of
Lady Tina Scott and the other defendants,
Cockerton, Kast and Aylott, charged with
having criminally libeled Earl Russell,
was resumed in the Criminal Court, Old
Bailey, this morning.
Earl Russell was called to the witness
stand and narrated the circumstances of
h;s purchasing and maintaining his yacht.
He had on board a mate named W. R.
Parker and a cabin boy named W.- 11.
Parker, who left his employ to go into the
royal navy. He was aware that W. H.
Parker had been subpenaed as a witness
in this case. It was not true that he had
ever kissed W. H. Parker.
He engaged Kast ac cabin boy in June,
1887. Among the guests on board the
yacht at the time were lon Thynne, Cecil
Fane and Lane Fox. Earl Russell then
proceeded to describe the arrangements
on board the yacht for the accommodation
of his guests and himself.
Earl Ruasell denied Kast's allegations
of immorality on board the yacht while
the vessel was at Norfolk roads. He then
produced his diary, and by it proved tuat
i it would have been impossible for the acts
charged to have occurred on the dates al
leged. Lord Russeil stated that Kast had
never slept in his cabin. He had dU
charced Kast because of his filthiness In
the use or towels.
E.Â»rl Russeil said that Kast had called
upon him once after leaving the yacht and
asked for work. Witness ueclined to re
employ Kast, but gave him a few shillings
to help him along. Aylott succeeded Kast
as cabin-boy on board the yacht upon the
recommendation of Cockerton. A lad
named Lenton, who he heard might ap
pear in the witness-box, was en. aged as
deckboy, but he was discharged because
he got drunk. The Earl narrated the
quarrels with his wiie over money matters
which had led to indecent alienations she
had broneht against him.
Eurl Russell emphatically denied that
he had been auilty of misconduct with
Aylott. He had discharged Cockerton for
drunkenness and for overstaying his leave
from the yacht. Aylott, he said, had
acted as a valet up to 1889. Coming to the
period of the marriage to Lady Scott's
daughter, the Earl said Lady Scott had
appeared to be on friendly terms with Mr.
Roberts (one of Lord Russell's Oxford
friends) while visiting his house, though
afterward she had made charges against
both Roberts and himself. The trial was
adjourned for the day. Lady Scott was
permitted to renew her bail for her ap
pearance to-morrow and allowed to co
free until then. '
BOLD ROBBERY ON A CABLE-CAR.
Desperadoes in Chicago Relieve Passen-
gers of Valuables and Make
Their Escape.
CHICAGO, 111, Nov. 24.â One of the
most daring crimes known in the annals
of this city was committed to-day and the
bold desperadoes who perpetrated it have
so far been able to elude the vigilance of
the police. The audacity of the offense
has taKen the city by storm, and unless
the police catch the criminals it is very
likely the citizens will demand a thorough
shaking up of tbe whoie force.
The scene of the crime was in the heart
of the retail section of the city. A State
street cable-car was proceeding along the
street at 0:30 this morning, when several
men who were standing on a corner mo
tioned to the conductor to stop. He did
so, and the two men boarded the car. As
it moved away three other men who were
standing on the opposite side of the street
J jumped on tbe front part of the car.
'â¢Fare, please," said the conductor to the
first two men, who were standing on the
rear platform.
"Get out,' 1 said one of them ana making
I a signal to the three men in front, he
1 quickly entered the c:ir. His companion
; planted himself in the doorway and pre
vnted the conductor from entering.
From the other end of the car two men
entered, and the third b.ocked the en
trance. The car was crowded at the time,
j and when the three men thiew tnemselves
i on L. C. Barber, a passenger, there was
great confusion, and several shouted,
"Throw him off."
At first it looked like a fight. The pas
j *engers, however, were soon undeceived.
Barber made a stout resistance, but two
men held him while a third went through
iiis pockets. He secured a watch and a
small sum of money.
Another passeneer was treated to the
same experience as Barber. By this time
every one in the car was up and making a
noise. Several opened the windows and
shouted, "Help! help!" while a few cried,
"Robber..!"
The car was moving all the time, as the
conductor was badly rattled. Finally Me
pulled himself together and gave the sig
nal for a quick stop. As soon as the car
stopped ttie robbers leaped from it and
disappeared down a side street. Two po-
Hcem n and a few passengers followed
them, but to no puipi>e.
The Chief of Police has notified every
policeman in Chicago, and a persistent
search is being made for the daring
thieves.
HAVED ELEVEN FRESHMEN
Seren Sophomore* Hum lleen Suspended
at l'rinceton.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 24â Seven
sophomores of Princeton University have
been suspended for the part they played
in the hazing of eleven freshmen. A
short time ngo twenty-five sophomores
took the eleven freshmen into the coun
try. far enough away from the university
to escape detection. They tied the fresh
men securely, after laying them on the
ground face downward.
Then the sophomores procepded to have
fun with the victims. It is reported that
they ran, jumped and fell upon the help
less freshmen until they were exhausted.
Then they untied the victims and told
them that if they reported thÂ»ir exper
iences to the college they would be pun
ished again.
One of the victims was W. Irving Clnrk,
Jr., a son of W. Irving Clark of this city.
He returned to his home in a badly used
up condition, but decided not to tell hid
father anything about the matter. It was
impossible, however, to conceal the facts
and he finally told his father.
His parents were at first not inclined to
allow him Â»o return to college, but the
boy insisted. Mr. Clark, however, reported
the outrage to the faculty and seven of
the worst offenders were suspended, while
young Clark was given assurance that he
would be protected from injury by any of
the students who were punished or by
their friends.

Death of Captaia W. G Pearne of the

en tbe 4ti Inst.
TOKIO, Japan, Nov. 7.â lt is confi
dently alleged that immediately before
the departure of the Russian representa
tive, Count Cassini, from Peking on Sep
tember 30, he succeeded in concluding
with the Chinese Government a conven
tion of great importance. The document
sets out by declaring that the concessions
made in it are by way of evincing China's
gratitude for the aid accorded by Russia
at tho close of the war between the former
power and Japan. It gives Russia the
right to carry her Trans-Siberian Railway
to Kirin from two points â namely, west
ward from some station in Siberia and
eastward from Vladivostok. It provides
that the Chinese system vt railways is to
be brought into connection with the Rus
sian, to which end, uhouid China nuts it
inconvenient to construct her contem
plated lines from Kirin to Snanhaikuan
and Port Arthur, she may delegate the
task to Russia.
It commissions Russia to provide for the
security of any lines built by her in Chi
nese territory, by stationing troops along
their route. It provides that lines form
ing part of the Russian system but run
ning through Chinese territory shall be
purchasable by China after a period of
thirty years, and that lines forming part
of the Chinese system, but built by Rus
sia at China's request, shall be purchasa
ble by China after a period of ten years.
It concedes to Russians the privilege of
working mines in Manchuria. It. states
that Russian officers shall be employed to
drill China's Manchurian levies. It leases
to Russia the port of Kiauchou, and prom
ises that, on emergency, she shall have
the use of Port Arthur and 1 alien, and it
engages that every facil ity shall be given
to Russian trade and travel.
The bubonic plague has made its ap
pearance in a virulent form at Talpeh in
iormosa. Forty-eight case 3 were re
ported between October 28 and November
1 and it has been deemed necessary to put
the medical inspection regulations into
force against ships coming from the isl
and. Among the forty-eight sufferers
thirty-six were Japanese. As yet the
plague has not spread beyond Taipeh and
vigorous measures are being taken to con
fine it to thiit city.
The new Governor-General received at
Kobe, while en route for Formosa, a tele
gram from the Minister of the Coloniza
tion Department, advising him of the ex
istence of the plague in the town where
his headquarters are situated and recom
mended that he should defer his de
parture. The Governor-General declined
to act on the recommendation, Dut tried
to induce his wife and mother to remain
behind in Japan. They, however, in
sisted on accompanying him.
Cholera continues to attack citizens of
Tokio with a degree of vigor unintelligible
in view of the cold weather and the ab
sence of any apparent center of contagion.
There have been over a hundred cases in
the space of three weeks.
The foreign community of Yokohama
has bÂ°en thrown into a state of consider
able excitement by two shocking events
that occurred in quick succession. The
first was the suicide of J. T. Boag, a genial
Scotchman and prominent member of so
ciety. Mr. Boag was a bill-broker. Ho
possessed a magnificent physique and had
always been conspicuous in athletic sports.
But the evil custom of the East, drcm
drinking, took hold of him several 3'ears
ago, and though he visited America for
the purpose of undergoing the gold cure
the relief thus obtained did not prove per
manent. Despairing of recovery from a
vice that revolted his self-respect and had
destroyed his chance of winning the hand
of a lady he loved he shot himself through
the head.

MURDER OF A MINISTER

DECATUR, 111 ., Nov. 24.â Rev. James
Milier, pastor of the Grace Methodist
Church of Bloomington, was found mur
dered this morning. He had been shot
in the center of tbe forehead. His pockets
were rifled and a revolver was lying by
his side.
The Rev. Mr. Miller had been in Spring

I evening. It is supposed that le walked
{ up the street to go to the residence of Dr.
Catto. On the wav he was shot and
robbed by some unknown person.
Three men were seen loitering in the
I neigh bcrhocd about that hour. The
! crime has caused a great deal of indigna-
I tion throuehout Central Illinois, where
: the Rev. Mr. Miller was well fcnown.
The only object for the cold-blooded
j murder was robbery, and it must have

DUPLICITY AND A TRAGEDY
Two Kodies Ttll the Tale of Suicide and
Murder.
INDIANOPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 24.â At an
early hour this morning the bodies of a
man and woman were found lying on the
ground' in front of a vacant house in
; Downey street. Each body lay in a pool
) of congealed blood, and a revolver, lying
close beside the man, showed how the
tragedy had occurred. ; V. I.'1 .'
From letters found on the man it was
ascertained that his name was Herman
Meyers. The woman was Nora A. Rich
ardson. The letters told the old story of
man's duplicity and woman's trustfulness
and frailty, and indicated how the tragical
end had come to pass.
Th*re could be no doubt from the letters
that Meyers had betrayed the girl under
promise of marriage and that she was
soon to become a mother. He had evi
dently refused to keep his promise. The
letters showed how she had begged him
to save her reputation, and how he had
refused to marry her.
It is supposed that she followed him and
bepeed him to keep his promise, until
finally in a fit of anger he shot her, and
then fearing the consequences took his
own life.

SPALDING'S CABLE
SCHEME PRESENTED
Dole Confers With Honolulu
Business Men on the
Project.
An Extension of Time That the
Regime Is Not Inclined
to Grant.
Liberal Subsidies Asked by the ProÂ«
moters of the Prcj*ct and Some
Inducements Offered.
HONOLULU, Hawaii, Nov. IS.â A num
ber of representative citizens were called
to meet the Executive in the President's
room on the morning of the 14th, in order
to obtain an expression of opinion upon
the expediency of enlarging and extend
ing the terms of the cable franchise which
was granted last year to Colonel Z. S.
Spalding, and by him transferred to the
Pacific Cabie Company of New Jersey, of
wnich Ppalding is president, and which
organization embraces such prominent
capitalists as D. O. Mills, Abram
Hewitt and Mr. Hail of the Northern Pa
cific Railway.
The meeting was called to order by
President Dole, who stated that a new
arrangement had been proposed by Colonel
Spaldin^ and his colleagues, and before
taking definite action, the Government
had deemed it advisable to consult with
the business men of the city. There were
present most of the members of the Coun
cil of State, Senators Brown, Schmidt,
Lansing, McCandless, Itice and Water
house, also Messrs. lrwin, Cooke, Ather
ton, Swanzy, Schaefer, the Chief Justice,
Alex Young, Professor W. D. Alexander,
B. F. Dillingham, Dr. C. B. Wood and
others.
Attorney- General Smith read the out
line of the new contract proposed by the
Pacific Cable Company. Mr. Spaiding's
present exclusive lrauchise for laying a
cable from North America to these
islands does not expire until May next
for the completion of the financial ar
rangements. He asks for no extension of
that time. But he wants a new contract
for an exclusive privilege to land cables i:i
Hawaii, connecting with Japan and Aus
tralia. He wants an extension of two
years in which to obtain a subsidy of $160,
-000 a year each from the Government of
Japan and from the Government of Aus
tralia. He also wants three years' addi
tional time in which to lay tne proposed
cables.
As an inducement for granting these
Irancbises Colonel Spalding will take up
$375, 000 of Hawaiian Government bonds at
4 tier cent of the proposed new issue for
refunding the Government debt. He will
make one-third of that amount a guar
antee for each of three things â a cable to
Japan, a cable to Australia and an intcr
island cable â in return for an exclusive
franchise of twenty years for operating
such cables. He will guarantee to lay the
inter-island cable within one year. He
asks no subsidy from Hawaii, but expects
exemption from taxation, navigation and
landing fees, etc., as in the present fran
chise.
John W. Foster spoke as the representa
tive of the Pacific Cable Company, in
wbose interest he was visiting Honolulu.
Colonel Spalding, ihroueh his arduous
work in Congress, had done a great deal
in advancing tne prospect of earlv success
Tne line to Japan would cost not less than
$7,500,000, and it would be unreasonable
to expect men to assume the task witnout
some show of returns to guarantee such
a great outlay of capital.
L. A. Thurston, as attorney for Spald
ing, then argued for the scheme, laying
stress on the advantage gained to Hawaii
by the purchase of Government bonds,
thereby giving a start to the bond scheme.
Aaain, capitalists would not make the im
mense outlay without an exclusive fran
chise. He called attention to the fact that
the contract would fix the maximum
charsre for rates at $1 a word to Australia
and Japan. The rates to San Francisco
would'not be over 40 per cent of that fig
ure.
After expressing their views and answer
ing questions Messrs. Foster and Thurs
ton withdrew.
A general discussion then followed, par
ticipated in by Messrs. Lansing, D;lling
ham, Wood, Schaefer, Young, Alexander,
McCandless, Swanzy, lrwin, Phillips,
Isenoerg, Juda, Waterhouse and Hack
leld. The opinions of most oi the speak
ers were strongly adverse, to granting the
exclusive franchise jinked for.
Mr. Swanzy pointed out the immense
increase in the conimj?r^e of the Pacific
which was close at hand." Tbe necessities
of this increase by development of Japan
and Russia could hardly now be measured.
The geographical Dosition of Hawaii is of
the most commanding nature. It would
be a great national and commercial error
for Hawaii to tie itself up to one concern
by an exclusive franchise.
W. G. lrwin ielt sure that the islands
would get the cable when the demands of
business required it. The time would
soon come when Hawaii would get cables
without making concessions and without
expense to the Government. He also
thoceht it improbable that Japan would
grant large powers to a foreign company.
The Attorney-General and Dr. Wood,
whs had lately visited Japan on official
business, both spoke of having learned
from 'an authoritative source while in
Japan that the Japanese Government, in
its present mocd and ambitious spirit,
might itself very soon lay a cable. At any
rate it would not look with favor or grant
concessions to a foreign corporation. It
must be a Japanese company with Japan
ese capital.
Professor Alexander tnought there were
excellent reasons ior hoping to gain Ja
pan's co-operation in laying a cable. That
country was ambitious for commercial
distinction and was growing very rich.
The Chief Justice thought no concession
would have any validity without the con
sent of the Legislature.
After a session of two hours President
Dole thanked the gentlemen for their at
tendance and intimated that he might
again call them together.
Mr. Foster was notified yesterday that
the Government was unable to comply
with Colonel Spalaing's request, but hoped
for his success in building the line origi
nally proposed to Hawaii.
News of McKinley's election came last
nieht by the Peking. General satisfaction
was expressed, Republican success being
more likely to be favorable to Hawaii.
Mr. FoÂ»ter sailed for home to-day by
tbe City of Peking.
Tbe Planters' Association met yester
day. They report a eton of 225,000 tons cf
sugar. The increase of Asiatics during
the year tx&s been 4700.

BERLIN, Germany, Nov. 24.â A serious
riot occurred at Lubock to-day growing
out of a strike of the hands employed in
Thiel's enamel factory. The places of
many of the strikers had been taken by

ALCOHOL IN ARTS AND TRADES.
Some Interesting Statements Made Before
the Congressional Joint Investi
gating Com fiittee.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 24. -The
Congressional joint committee investi
gating the subject of the result of the free
alcohol in the arts and manufactures and
in medicinal compounds, with a view to
devising and reporting a scheme of regu
lations by which that use may be secured
without detriment to the revenues of tne
Government, resumed its session to-day at
the Capitol. All the members were pres
ent except Senator Aldricb. Charles H.
Merritt, accompanied by S. C. Holly, J. C.
Millard, Frank M. Storr and Nelson
Booth, appeared as representatives of the
National Association of Hatmakers and
addressed tbe committee. He explained
the operations of making stiff bats to
show wherein alcohol was used in the
construction of the article. Its office is
to dissole gum shellac and thereby fit
it Tor introduction in the hat body to
stiffen it. Wood alcohol is almost entirely
used, although the general consensus of
opinion of manufacturers was that grain
alcohol was superior to wood alcoiroi. The
competition in the trade is so close, Mr.
Merritt said, that the makers felt that
they were entitled to Government aid.
Wood aicohol pays no internal revenue
tax, so that it cuts no figure to the Gov
ernment. But the trade wants to use
grain alcohol and would do so if it were
free from tax.
Mr. Hoily, also a member of the hat
makers' committee, informed the com
mittee that if the manufacturers could use
grain alcohol in their trade the people
would get a better hat ior the same money.
Mr. Bates of the Internal Revenue Bureau,
who was present with two or three asso
ciates, expressed the opinion that the re
moval of tne tax upon alcohol used in
manufactures would be a tremendous
temptation to commit frauds upon the
revenues. The hearing at this point
< rifled into a somewhat informal discus
sion of methods by which frauds could be
prevented, if at all. Mr. Bates said the
least objectionable method, probably,
would be to require tbe manufacturers to
pay the co9t oi extra precaution.
Frank Storr and Nilson Booth, opera
tives, gave to the committee the results of
their experieuce as to the effects of wood
alcohol upon employes who work with it.
These are generally bad, producing
headache, inflammation of the eyes and a
catarrhal-like condition of the throat.
Senator Chandler of New Hampshire
informally addressed the committee. He
said that three propositions could not be
denied â First, that alcohol used as a
beverage and to make men drunk should
be taxed 900 Der cent; second, that
alcohol used in the arts and medicines
should not be taxed at nil or at most only
to save the Government in the matter of
expenditure for extra precaution; third,
that it should not be "taxed more when
used in beneficial medicines. To say that
such a law could not be passed and suc
cessfully administered was to impeach the
ability of the American people to organ
ize a proper Internal Revenue Bureau. It
bad been done in other countries and
could bs done here
After an executive session the commit
tee adjourned, to meet Monday morning
ia New York City.
VICTORS FOR CONNOLLY
He Defeats Tom Causer in the fifth
Hound.
BIRMINGHAM, Eng., Nov. 24.â The
match between Eddy Connolly of St.
John, N. 8., and Tom Causer, an
English lightweight, took place to-night
at the Olympic Athletic Club, this city,
and resulted in a victory for Connolly, j
who defeated .his opponent in the fifth ,
round. The men were matched to fight I
twenty rounds for a purse of Â£200. Causer \
was the favorite in the betting at odds of j
6to 4. The men were supposed to enter j
the ring at 133 pounds, but both were over- |
weight. . The clubhouse was crowded.
Billy Briesley, Jimmy Keily and Anthony
Diemond seconded Connolly, while JacK
McFarlane and Harry Overtop acted in a
â¢similar capacity for Causer. :
In the first round Connolly forced the j
fighting and landed heavily on Causer's,
jaw. A claim of foul against Connolly in
this round was not allowed. In the sec
ond round Connolly smashed Causer in
the .throat. The former was hissed for
hitting his opponent while they were
clinched. Causer drew first blood, land
ine heavily, which caused Connolly to
reel atrainst the ropes. Connolly recov
ered and banged Causer right and left.
Connolly had the best of the round.
In the' third round Causer twice hit Con
nolly heavily on the chin and generally
bad the best of it.
In the fourth round Causer was simi
larly favored ana his friends became jubi
lant. When the men came up in tne fifth
round it was anybody's fight. After spar
ring for a wi.ile Connolly jabbed Causer in
the throat and knocked him down, fee
picked himself up, but Connolly immedi
ately clinched and threw him. He could
not come to time and was counted out.

California Editors "Who Took a Prominent Part in the Convention at Vallejo.
YE EDITORS BID
VALLEJO GOOD-BY
All Enjoy a Visit to the
Mare Island Navy-
Yard.
That Airship Comes Up as a
Subject Requiring Much
Discussion.
The Scribes Loudly Praise the City
Wherein They Have Been
Entertained.
VALLEJO, Cal., Nov. 24.â Tbe mem
bers of the California Press Association
1 were up with the lark this morning and
j ready for their trip to tne navy-yard at
. Mare Island. That is, they would have
j been if Vallejo were given to larks, but in
j tbeir absence Editor Barcar of the Vaca
j ville Reporter sugsested that it was about
tbe time the airship was gome to bed.
The airship was a prolific source of ar
gnment among the knights of the shears
prior to the pleasure excursion, and the
opinions in its existence and attributes
i were many and varied.
Willis of the Sacramento Record-Un ion
asserted in tones of the most positive con
viction that he saw it Sunday uizht hover
ing over Sacramento and then coing to the
southward with a peculiar, wavy flight.
He described it as a bright light with an
opaque body dimly discernible over it,
ana says it was about 1000 feet from the
earth.
J. A. Filcher, president of the State !
Board of Trade and proprietor of the j
Placer Herald, thought it a serious propo
sition when the Chronicle had taken up
what it at first designated as "a Call
fake." He Tnought that fact proof enough
that there was something sailing in t.iO
air, whether it was an aerial machine or
not.
J. E. Walden of the Napa Journal
thought it a mighty fishy story, butdidn't
like to disbelieve the many persons of j
known veracity claiming to have optical
evidence of its existence. If it had ap
peared in any other paper than The Call
he should have paid no attention to it.
Brother Pennycooi of the Vallejo Chron- I
icle is still a confirmed skeptic, and re
marked in a jocular manner that there .
must be a considerable quantity of bad
liquor imported into the State in the last
week or two.
W. M. Der.io. a Vallejo biacksrnitn pres
ent, said VÂ»s Wilson, the Sheriff of Butte
County, while staying with him a day or
two ago declared that he knew for certain
such a machine was being built near Oro
ville.. Some of the editors were so eager
for news that they wanted lo hunt the
Sheriff up and "pump" him for more, but
he "'had went."
F. W. Johnson, business manager of
the Marysville Appeal, said he saw the
airship very plainly over that city a few
days ago, but did not care to say anything
about it for fear of being laughed at.
Then everybody laughed.
All the editors in the party, several of
them being accompanied by their wives,
crossed over to Mare Island in the ferry
boat Ellen at 10:30 o'c!oct. Editor Pen
nycook and H. D. Richardson had been
appointed a committee to take the party
around to the various places of interest,
and attended to their part of the pro
gramme well.
When the island was reached Chaplain !
McAllister was in watting to assist the i
committee. He informed them that Ad
miral Kirkland had just sent oraers to ttie
captains of all the vessels to sparj no
pains in showing and explaining all the
interesting points about the great war j
Tessels.
On the Monterey Chief Gunner Batson |
and W. Molten, the paymaster's clerk,
took everybody around and explained the !
working of the machinery. This was re
peated on the Monadnock. The Monterey
was in holiday attire, being gayly deco
rated with flowers and bunting, it being
the occasion of an informal reception to
the wife of Captain Clark. The steel
cruiser Bennington, now in the drydocks,
came in for a deal of comment, the ladies
especially declaring it "perfectly horrid"
that so beautiful a vessel should be used
only as an instrument of destruction.
The old ship Independence and the ord
nance department wee also visited.
On the return to Vallejo, late in the
afternoon, Editor McCrauey of the Sacra
mento County Ledger was asked by sev
eral of his journalistic brethren why he
had been so quiet ana preoccupied during
the day.
"Well. I'll tell you," he said. "Before
J came down here i wrote an editorial for
my paper, whicu will appear next Friday.
In it I stated chat the Examiner devoted a
whole page to the Portland Oregonian
article, and yet was more to blame than
all the rest of the metropolitan dailies
combined. Now the wording and facts in
that editorial are so similar to what
Colonel Irish said in his address that I an
afraid I shall be accused of plagiarism."
"Oh, you needn't let tbat bother you
particularly," said some one jocularly.
"There is so much unanimity of opinion
on that subject that any one writing" intel
ligible English is likely to be accused of
the same thing."
Most of the visiting editors took the
evening boats for home, but a few will re
main until to-morrow. They all ex
pressed themselves as highly gratified at
the reception they had been given, and de
parted with many expressions of gratitude
tor the kindness of the citizens of Vallejo.
WRECKED SCHOONER SIGHTED.
A Derelict Vessel Seen Floating Bottom
Up Off the Mouth of the Colum
bia River.
PORTLAND, Or , Nov. 24â During the
past three weeks incoming vessels have
reported having sighted a derelict vessel
floating bottom up. The craft appears to
be a schooner of about 100 tons. On Sat
urday last the British ship Roekhurst
sighted the capsized schooner, it then
being about thirty miles west of the mouth
of the Columbia. Tbe course of the Rock
hurst was altered so as to bring the ship
to pass within a cable length of the dere
lict, but although a heavy sea was on and
the overturned hull rolled badly in the
seaway it net so deep that no glimpse of
the name could be secured.
The derelict is evidently some lumber
laden vessel from the Sound or Grays
Harbor, tbe fact of its keeping afloat so
steadily for such a length of time indicat
ing that it carries a cargo of lumber. The
members of the crew were undoubtedly
drowned to a man, ior in the storms that
have swept the Northern Pacific daring
past weeks no yawl carried by a schooner
of the size of the one sighted could live in
the sea rolled up by the gales ev-^n if the
men had an opportunity to launch a boat.

Light signal practice was gone through
with this forenoon. With the exception
of such mental drill a few more times the
men will have complete rest ? until they
appear on the Central. Park gridiron field
in San Francisco Thursday afternoon.
All are now in prime physical condition,
and if any should be injured' and; retired
during the game their places can be well
filled by good men from the best second
team Stanford has ever had. The retire
ment of no one man would seriously
cripple this year's Varsity, so plentiful is
the fine football material.
â¢ To-morrow afternoon the football squad
I will - pack up their. much-used and dirt
j begrimnled padded suits and move down
to the Hotel Vendome in San Jose. There
they will . quietly spend the last night De
fore the day of the supreme ; struggle for
which they have so long and so faithfully
trained. On Thursday morning they will
start for San Francisco in a special car,
and will probably go to the Hotel Pleas
anton to spend the last quiet hours before
the game.

HERKELEY'S MUSCEAD KNIGHTS
football Men and "Hooters" Are Ready
for the Struggle.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 24.â 0n1y a few
hours remain before the great intercol
legiate football contest of tbe year on the
Pacific Coast will be on. In these few
hours the players will devote themselves
to the final planning for the great but
brief campaign upon which they are about
to enter. From now until the kict-eff on
Thursday afternoon the Varsity players
will be "the subjects of every "attention
from their enthusiastic friends among
the students, as well as from their coach
ers and trainers. As the snpple muscles
of a fiery steea are rubbed and bathed
before starting in a handicap, so will tbe
joints, muscles and sinews of the Berke
ley football heroes be anointed and rubbed.
While the trainers are putting on tbe
finishing touches to the muscled kmgiis
of the gridiron, the "rooters," who will
make tbe noise on the day of battle to
urpe their comrades on, will be training
their throats and voices. They will pre
pare themselves with songs, jibes and
joshes, which are destined to strike terror
into the hearts of the Palo Alto men and
to drown their Rah! Rah! Rahs!
An enthusiastic meeting was held by
the Associated Students this afternoon,im
mediately ioliowing drill, to take prelim
inary steps in the organization of the
singing and "rooting' contingents. The
annual "send-off" will be given the boys
to-morrow evening at tne training quar
ters. Shortly after 7 o'clock the entire
student body, including a delegation from
the Affiliated Colleges, will gather at
fc-iiles Hall for an hour's practice with
the songs and joshes. After the practice
they will go in a body to the training
quarters, where yells "will be emitted,
songs and speeches made. Each member
of the team, as well as Buuerwonh and
Kott, will be called upon lor remarks.
This ia one of the songs which the
Berkeley boys will practice. It is called
the "patent adjustable football song" be
cause it can be rendered to four different
tunes:
Sing rumpty-lddity. boom ta rah!
We're goiriK to win thai game!
We'll .-how those Redcoats who we are
And roll them in mod and stiame; Â«
We'll pick them up and whirl them round,
And whack them down upon the ground,
â  With a "Ha, ha, ha. CaJiloru-ya'a! â 
Berkeley, zip, boom, ah!"
So all together thenâ one. two, three!
Hurrah .or our Berke ey team!
We'll cheer them on to victory
Wltn a whoop, a yell and a scream.
Who'll bag their heads with woe untold. -
When above' their lied goes the Blue and Gold?
With a "Ha, ha, ha. Calliorn-yah!
â  Berkeley, zip, boom, ah!" "â¢ ;.-"
When the rooters have become tired of
singing long songs the shorter slogans of
war, such as this, will be tried:
Our team's a daisy ;
'Twill set Stanford crazy,
And beat her easy.
How do we kuow?
Our team's a beauty. .
Stanford's is fruity.
How-ln-tne-duce-will-we-find-tbat-out? >-"' :.
Our play Â« Ul show.
Then will come the yells â the long ones
and the short â and finally such jests
; and joshes as this: \.,V' Â
CaM-for-nl-a! â  â¢Â« i .
Ob, my Alma Mate !
Bally up your forces and * '
slap btanf ord on the Pate !
The players were taken through another
course of signal practice this afternoon.
For a short time the second eleven lined
up against the Varsity, and interference
was practiced.
Ransome made the punt of his life,
kicking tne pigskin on a pass from the
quarter seventy-six yards by actual meas
urement.
To-night the boys were given a good
rub-down and were ordered to retire early.
To-morrow afternoon the work of to-day
will be repeated. They will not go to San
Francisco to spend the last night before
tbe great game, as has bean the custom
for the past two years, but will remain at
the training-house. They will not go to
the City until Thursday morning.
Bernard Miller, in whose hands has been
placed the cusiody of the little bear which
will be Berkeley's mascot on Thanksgiv
ing day, will bring young bruin to the
campus in the morning and give him an
introduction into college life and college
ways.

Health is an inheritance due to every

costs no money and is more precious
than a mountain of diamonds.
The child's health depends almost
wholly on the mother's, not only before
its birth but afterwards. A sick" mother
can't properly care for her child's health.
A sick mother sometimes bears a healthy
child, but it isn't to be expected. Maybe
the baby will possess the appearance of
health, but will lack stamina. Maybe
innate weakness will develop in after
years.
Every woman should be particularly
careful of her health during the period
of gestationâ when the child is really a
part of herself. \ "
y During all this time, she should keep
her body strong and pure and she should
take proper precautions against her time
of labor. For this purpose Dr. Pierces

has been used in thousands of cases,

stored Jim Oorbett May
; Fight Again.
Golden Gate Park furnishes a recreation
ground for more people than even its most
enthusiastic supporters have any notion
of. In point of fact many of our wealth
iest people go there fora walk every day
of their li*es, and it has been the scene of
many a philanthropic act that the world
generally "wots not of." One of the most
recent as well as ona of the most pleas
ing is that of the poor fellow who was
found in an almost helpless condition, re
clining on one of the benches with which
the "great playground" is liberaily sup
plied.
If the facts are known to almost every
one, the story is well worth telling over
againâ for it points a moralâ it adorns a
character with that "milk of human kind
ness," the possession of wnien is claimed
by so many, and yet owned by few. But
about the story. It is this:
A gentleman noted for ins handsome
teeth, his luxuriant auburn liair, his devo
tion to pedet-trianism, and his many quiet
chariable acts, was strolling â or rather
walking briskly â through the "Pan
handle" of the Park when his attention
was attracted by a man, sitting ap
parently asleep on one of the afore
said benches. His head was bent over
his chest and he swayed as though
rocked by the wind. The face was drawn,
and yet not harsh. "That poor devil is
ill," said the man of the auburn hair men
tally. A second gbnee showed that tbe
"poor dcvii" had a sheet of paper grasped
in bis left hand. Clearly there was a man
who had fooled with a woman â and had
himself beea fooled. But tbe man with
the auburn hair has sympathy for
even such fools as that. He approached
the "Poor devil." A glance at close quar
ters and all the illusion was dispelled. In
front of him was a man evidently seriously
ill. He placed his hand kindly on his
shoulder and said "Can I do anything for
you ?" "I guess not," said tbe "Poor
devil," but he said it in such a weak, thin,
halting voice that the questioner said in a
second "Now, I see that you really need
assistance. Why are you sitting here ?"
"I am trying to get energy enough to go
down there," he replied in a half mechan
ical way, and he exhibited a circular which
is sent out to sufferers by the Hudson
Medical Institute.
'ivet me help you," said the man with
tbe auburn hair.
Ileallv, that is all there is to the story 1
The fact that he was taken down to the
great Hudson Medical Institute at the
corner of Market, Stockton and Ellis
streets; that there they found that it was
merely a severe case of nervous debility,
accompanied with tbe effects of blood
poisonir.ir which had occurred years be
fore; that they placed h!m under their
wonderful "remedio-treatment" with their
remarkable "Hudyan"; that he was cured
in six weess or two months and sent back
to his home in Mendocino County when
he bad contemplated a trip to the other
world by his own weak hand â these are
all iacta within tbe knowledge of every
one who has heard the story. Bnt tbat
does not detract one whit from the state
ment that the man witb the aubaru bar
saved a man's life; nor does it do more
than add more testimony to the already
well-admitted fact that tbe doctors of the
Hudson Medical Institute do bring back
vitality in every case which, they under
take. This in so well understood by men
about town that it is generally conceded
that if Corbett would take a course of
"Hudyan" he might even get into condi
tion to fight again. While the Hudson
doctors are willing to send circulars and
testimonials â as ibey did to this "poor
devil" â they are not given to discussing
prize-fighters, or, for that matter, talking
about an y body, but, like most other people
who don't "talk," they do wonderful work.

Courteous to the Judge Who
Sentenced Him to Be
Hanged.
The Djcm of Mrs. Greenwood's
Assassin Pronounced
at Napa.
Belief of the Prisoner That He Will
Reappear on Earth in Another
Form.
NAPA, Cal., Nov. 24.â Sentence of
death was pronounced this morninc upon
William M. Roe, the murderer of Mrs.
, John Q. Greenwood. The assassin, un
moved and apparently uninterested in
the proceedings, thanked the court, and a
famous chapter in tl.e criminal annals of
Napa County was at an end â at an end
save that the law must yet take its course
and avenge the woman's death.*
Judge Murphy came up from San Fran
cisco on this morning's train, and shortly
after 10 o'clock the courthouse bell called
f. the officers of the court to the temple of
justice. The courtroom was soon crowded.
Judee Murphy discharged his duty calmly
and witli grpat seriousness
â¢â¢William Hoe, stand up, sir," said the
court.
Roe did as commanded.
"You are informed against by the Dis
trict Attorney of this county by an infor
mation 1-led in this court, in and by which
you were accused of the crime of murder
alleged to have been committed in this
connty of Napa upon the 9th ilay of Feb
ruary, 1891, and the murder wa^ alleged
to have been committed in the following
manner," was Judge Murphy's preci>e
manner of stating the ca^e. "That is."
.he continued, "that you did before tne
tiling of this information willlully, v nlaw
fully, feloniously and of your malice afore
â¢thought kill and murder one Mrs. John
Q. Greenwood, a human being. To '.hi?
information upon your arraignment you
entered your plea of 'not guilty.' You
were subsequently tried before a jury ot
your own selection, who, after hearing the
evidence in the case, lonnd you guilty of
murder in the first degree. This is the
time set for pronouncing judgment. Have
you any legal cause to show why this
judgment of the iaw and the sentence ot
the court should not be pronounced upon
you?"
Mr. Beersfecher then moved for a new
trial on the groundsâ First, that the court
erred In its decisions of law arising during
the course of the trial; second, the court
misdirected the jury in matters of law;
inird, the verdict was contrary to law ;
fourth, the verdict was contrary to the evi
dence.
â¢"I will hear yon on anything yon have
to say in support of your notice, if you de
sire to make any points before the court,"
eaid Judge Murphy.
"We don't desire to make any argument
or take up the tine of the court, 1 ' was the
reply.
("Since the verdict in this case I have
riven the matter serious reflection and
thought," continued Judge Murphy, "in
view of the consequences of the verdict
that has been rendered by the jur}'. I am
familiar with all tne ruimgs of the court
and also with the charge given to the
jury, i am satisfied that there was no
error committed by the court, either in
tne rej-ction or admission of any testi
mony in this case. lam also satisfied
tuat the instructions asked for by t!ie de
fendant, and which were in accordance
with the law and applicable to t c case
were given fully and fairly. I believe that
tne charge was an unbiased and fair
charge and fair explanation of the Jaw,
and certainly it was as far aa my Knowl
edge would permit me to give.
"During the entire trial I studiously en
deavored to ?ee tliat this deiendant Â«-hould
have an impartial trial. If I wÂ«s con
scious that any wrone had been done to
this deiendant, or that lie had been de
prived of any legal rieht, I woul.J cer
tainly, without hesitation, grant him a
new trial. And feeling this great respon
sibility that rests upon me lam led to de
. Clare and do declare mv full belief that
â¢ this defendant has bad every advantage
yes, nioro perhaps than a strict compli
ance of the law would have R,\-en him.
fclo far as the verd:c of the jury is con
cerned, I see no reason to duiiDt the cor
, rectuess of tt;e verdict.
"The motion for a new trial is denied.
Is there anything ehe to be said, gentle
men? Does the defendant desire to say
anything before the judgment of the law
is pronounced?"
. â¢ Then the murderer, speaking as one
who had a grievance but was too obliging
to complain, said :
"Your Honor please, I am much obliged
fo you for the way you have conducted
the case. I am perfectly snti.-fied with
the way you nave conducted it. Accord
ing to the testimony I think the jury was
P right in returning a verdict of guilty. At
J the same time I was deprived of some
witnesses. I had subpenaed eleven and I
got three, But they say everything is for
the best and I am satisfied."
"I should be very sorry. Mr. Koe, that a
man in your position should feel that he
had, by any act of the sovereign people of
this State, been deprived of any right,"
. m said the court. "If yon had asked me or
if your counsel had asked me to continue
this case for the purpose of Inter endeav
ors to procure those witnesses 1 would
have done it. I intended, ns I said be
,fore, that you should nave a fair trial,
and I boli-ve that you nave had- a fair
trial. I should regret, perhaps to the last
moment of my Hie, if I was conscious of
anything that deprived you of au inipar
" ' tia! trial. Such I believe you have had.
.Is there anything further you desire to
s:jy. sir?"
"No, sir," Roe responded.
"William il. Roe." Judge Murphy con
tinued, solemnly, "it now becomes the
duty of the court to award atrainst you
the judgment which the law affixes to the
crime o! which you have been convicted.
Our Penal Code provides that every per
son guilty of murder in the first degree
. shall be punished by death or confinement
in the State prison for life at the discre
tion of the jury trying the same. The
jury impaneled in this ense found you
guilty of murder in the first degree, but
â¢failed to exercise the discretion given
them; hence there can be no other jude
, nient pronounced by the court than t:iat
of death. You have been found guilty of
the highest and most heinous offense
known to the lawâ that of takinsr the life
'j! Mrs. J Q. Greenwood with deliberate
and premeditated malice aforethought,
k 'The jury which tried your case and
% lf nderei this verdict was composed of
Ay nest, intelligent and conscientious men.
rnejr gave to the testimony the most care-
Btiemion and arrived at their verdict
tifh l ? pon lho testimony they heard, and
w jtn the only desire to do exact justice.
lmu the verdict they rendered was a just
. 2 T l 7"i. one tne court has no doubt of,
. ana A fully indorse tue said verdict. Since
tne rendition of this vetdtct I have care
fully congidered tbe same, and reyieweU
the testimony adduced at the trial, and j
am satisfied no honest, conscientious, fair- !
minded jury couid have airived at any
other conclusion. In the justness
of your conviction the court ex
presses it 3 "full concurrence. You
liave had an absolutely fair and
impartial trial, and your guiit was estab
lished beyond any reasonable doubt.
There are no circumstanct- s known to tne
court or appearing in the evidence which
in the slightest degree tend to mitigate
the atrocity of yonr crime. The murder
by you of Mrs. Greenwood was wanton,
malicious, cruel and without the slightest
excuse or semblance of palliation. I h:;vc
no desire to harrow your feelings or to add
a p::ngto your conscience, Dut I do suggest
in all earnestness in view of what I oe
lievc to be your certa:n doom to lay aside
the disregard you seem to entertain as 10
your present surroundings and the awful
death that awaits you, and to seek forgive
ness from the God who made you.
"The judgment of the law'and the sen
tence of the court is, that you, William M.
Roe, be taken hence by the Sheriff of this
county of Napa, and by him detained and i
securely kept in the "connty jail in :.d: .d i
county of Napa until each day as shall be
hereafter designated and fixed by the j
court in the warrant of execution to be
issued herein, and on the said day so
designated and fixed in said warrant, and
between the hours therein named, that
you, William If. Roe, for the willful, de
liberate and premeditated murder of Mrs.
John Q. (Greenwood, and within the walls
or yÂ«rd of the county jail of said county
of Napa or some convenient place
in this county, be, by tbe Sheriff of said i
county of Napa aioresaid, hanged by the j
neck until you shall be dead, and may
God have mercy on your soul."
'"Thank you," said Roe.
Later the deatli warrant was signed and
the 16.h day uf January. 1897, between the
hours of 10 and A o'clock, was fixed as the '
uay of the execution.
At the conclusion of the court proceed
ings a Call representative was admitted
to the jail and for over an hour had con
versation with Roe. When first seen the
prisoner was sitting on a box reading a
I French novel. He seemed much inter
ested in ihe story, but manifested but lit
tle interest in the fact that he had just j
been doomed to die.
"I feel a little queer," said Roe. "A
person naturally wonli. It is something
thatilon'i linp|>en to a man everyday.
The Judge said I ought to consider the
sentence just passed upon me. I do con
sider it jeriously, but I have so trained
myself that I can talk one thing and
mean another; but to tell the truth I did
not feel very sorry lor myself. 1 would '
lihvc felt twice as sorry to sit by a friend \
and nave him receive sentence of deatli. !
I Now there is 'Old Wall,' he has been kind
I to me and 1 would be twice as sorry to
i have judgment of death passed on him
than to receive it myself."
A person could not doubt that Roe cared
little regarding himself. No manife-ta
tions of resret were shown. Perfectly
calm and deliberate the prisoner was as he
spoke of his own fate. Sometimes he was
j sitting on tne bed and at other times care
j lesslj leaoiaft against the door of his ca;i.
He lighted a cigar and continued his con
ver:?ation.
"What about the Judge, did you ask? I
couid not have had a better judge if I
baa my choice. His decision was good,
aud in his charge to the jury he stated
fairly all grounds for rettsonable doubt.
I had suop**naed eleven witnesses, but only
secured three. If I had obtained the
others tbe verdict might have been differ
ent, borne of these witnesses lived in
San Francisco and would have testified
that I was in that City at the time of the
murder; but it is all rieht. The jury gave
the verdict in accordance with testimony.
"Do I bolive id a Divinity? Well, I
I don't know. I believe in natures Jaws
| and in evolution. We must abide by
those laws or get punished. I trans
gressed and lam punished. What comes
lifter death 1 don't Know. I came into |
the world and I leave it. There is almost j
a fatality, but I will not say that, for i
tnat is too deep water forme; but tbe
spirit lives alter death, but enters some
other form of life on this earth. The
Mosaic law contain true principles and is
ihe foundation of our present laws."
Moore then spoke in reference to liter- j
ature. especially works of fiction. The I
Sheriff returning, the murderer was again j
left to himself in his narrow cell.
MONTEREY COWBOY'S SUICIDE.
Charles Woods, Famed as a Riata-
Tt rower and Bronco- Rider, Ends
His Life.
MONTEREY, Cal.. Nov. 24.â One of
the most reckless and intrepid cowboys on
this coast, and the most skilled and dar
ing of the many vaqueros in this county,
committed suicide last niglit by taking an
ounce of laudanum.
Charles Woods has been about Mon
terey for the last two yearn, and during
most of the time uas employed on the
largest cattle raocu in Monterey County â
that of Sargent, Grapg & Sargent. Not
only was Woods a successful cow-puncher,
but he wa* considered the best "bronco
buster" in that part of the State. It was
said of him that he could ride anything
with four legs. He wa3 robust and strong,
over six feet tall, with lonp, wavy biacfc
hair which hun^Jover his shoulders, and
when seen in the saddie on !;is favorite
pony Dynamite, swinging his riata all
ready and waiting lor a chance at the
luckless bronco to be lassoed, he, indeed,
seemed a tower of strength.
Woods came to Monterey about two
years ago from ArizonÃ. It "was not long
before he was known among the vaqueros
hereabouts as a good man witti the rope.
Being an American and an expert with
the riata he soon beenme very much dis
liked among his ranch companions. Many
a race was run and many a trick per
formed for tne amusement of spectators,
as a result of the feeling among these men,
but Wood was always a. little better than
the rest of his competitors. It was only a
little over a year ago, however, wben Wal
ter S. Hohart was at Del Mqnte and ar
ranged to have a Wild West show that
Woods showed np in splendid lorm and
proved to be the best of all vaqueros in
this county. Some of the feau that ne
performed then wete reckless and marvel
ous. Ever after that performance no dis
pute was made as to his superiority as a
cowboy, and all the S[ anish and Mexican
vaqueyos looked to him as a leaaer. He
was with Buffalo Bill for a long while and
also with several other Wild West snows,
but left them because, he said, be did not
like to "show off."
No cause can be attributed for Woods
taking his own life except that he had
been drinking of late too freely, and it is
believed by his friends that ha "decided he
couid not stop drinking and ended his
life quick y. He got a friend to procure
an ounces of laudanum, saying he had a
toothache. After thanking his friend he
walked away from him and entering the
Union saloon, where he was well known,
he informed the barkeeper that he was
going in the rear room to take a nap. He
remained there several hours, and the
barkeeper, thinking it time he should go
home, went to arouse him. Woods was
sitting erect in one chair with bis feet on
another and his ooott- off, out had prob
ably been dead for some time. It U be
lieved he took the poison before he en
tered the saloon. The empty vial was
found In his pocket, together "with n note
asking his wife to forgive him. Woods
leaves a widow end a child.

j the death of Dr. J. H. C. lionte, lawyer,
i theologian, jcientisi.stndent and secretary
of the Hoard of Regents of the State Uni-
I versitv, came as a great shock to his co
; laborers in thefiniversity faculty and to
: his wide circle of friends in the coruniu
! nity. Though the doctor had been ailing
! for some time past his death was entirely
{ unexpected.
He became ill about three weeks ago
i with a ccld, and after several days' ab
sence from his duties decided to go to
! Sacramento, where he could be under the
care o! Dr. Parkinson, his son-in-law, Dr.
Payne, his family physician in Berkeley,

i und immediately after being handed the
telesram went to his office at North Hall
and ordered that all exercises of the uni

He spent weeks in the lobby at the State
capital at his own expense, working for
the passage of the measure.

yon College, receiving the degree A.M. I
| In 1880 the same college conlerred ur.on !

daughters is the wife of George Reed of
Sun Francisco, anoiber is Mrs. Dr. Park
inson of Sacramento, whiio ihe third is
! unmurried.
His only son is C. C. Bonte, chief clerk
o! the Southern Pacific Company's shops
at Sacramento.
As a business man Dr. Bonte was con
servative and shrewd, and he displayed
much ability in guarding the interests of
I the university which the Board of Regents
i had intrusted to him. William McKeown,
j who has been assistant secreiary to Dr! I
! i3onte for a number of years, has been |
j prominently mentioned as his successor.

ASH FORD'S QUADRUPLE TRAGEDY.
In a Fit of Insanity a Mother Cuts the
Throats of Her Three Children
and Herself.
CENTRALIA, Wash., Nov. 24.â Details
of a quadruple tragedy enacted last Fri
day af:ernoon near Ashford, Pierce
County, were received here to-day. Mr*.
Swearnier, tbe wife of a farmer, while in
an insane fit cut the throats of her three
little girls and then inflicted an ugly gash
in her own throat.
One girl. 3 years old, is dead and one 5
years of age is not expected to live. The
mother and a baby 9 montns old seem to
be recovering, and with good care will
probably come out all right.
The crime was discovered by the hus
band, who at the time was working in a
barn, fifty feet from the house. Soon after
1 o'clock ne went to tbe house to er.t and
saw the four bodies lying on tbe kitchen
floor.
The baby was dead and the other two
children were struggling to cry, Outwore
able to make no sound but a hoarse, gasp
ing noise. Tbe throats of the smaller two
children were cut from ear !o ear. The
mother was unconscious. A bloody
butcher-knife was clinched in one hand.
There was a gash three inches long In her
throat, but she had missed the jugular
vein by a quarter incb.
The eldest daughter was lying across
the body of her mother, witli one hand
clutching at the wound in her neck. The
floor was covered with blood from one end
to the other and the walls spattered, as
though the children had a terrible
strusgle to get away from tbe crazed
woman.
Swearnier picke.l tip the baby and
rushed to the home of 11. D. Hall, who
I lived near by. The bodies were removed
! to Hall's dwelling, and a doctor. was sum-
I moned. from As.iford, three miles away.
! The neighbors say Mrs. Swearnier acted
I strangely of iate, and they believed it un
; safe to leave her alone, bat, the .husband
i scouted the idea.l^^^^^^Hl^^^^^^B
CRUELTY AT WHITTIER.
Charges Preferred by a Man Who Was
Once an Employe at the Reform
School.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Nov. 24.-Tbe
latest revelations respecting alleged cru
elties at the Whittier State Reform School
are beginning to menace the positions of
some of the higher officials.
The dismissals heretofore have all been
of subordinates who have claimed, bow
ever, that they were only doing the bid
ding of their superiors when inflicting tbe
floggings which caused the late discharges
of the Board of Trustees.
The latest disclosures hinges on state
ments made to the District Attornev'sorh'ce
by J. \V. Estes of Pasadena regarding the
| treatment of the boys of the institution.
Two years he was employed at Whittier,
and be says that what he saw then obliged
i him to leave.
He has had considerable experience
with criminals of all classes, having for a
number of years been superintendent of
. the shoe department in the Maine peni
tentiary, but in all his experience he never
saw men treated as these boys were.
Estes says he has seen the officers strip
! a boy and lash him with a cat-'o-nine
j tails un;il the blood ran down his back,
; and then sit down and jestingly remark
that "be would venture to say that his
clothes would stick to his back for a
while."
One morning he entered the shoe de
partment and found the overseer jerking
and slamming one of the boys about by
the hair of the head. These instances, he
says, were but slight examples of what
might be related, but he prefers to keep
I the rest for an investigation, wtien it will
j properly come out. It is claimed there
j are a number of people in the neighbor
j hood of Whittier who know the facts.

CARSON, Nev., Nov. 24.â The guardians
of the child of Mrs. Hartley, who is in
the penitentiary for shooting Senator
Foley in Reno, several years ago, are suing
for a portion of the Foley estate for the
child, claiming that Foley is the father,
and that before receiving the wound
which caused his death he had signed a
paper before a witness! acknowledging
the child as his. The case was called in
the United States District Court here to
day.
the main question asked talesmen was:
"Are you a married man? " Mrs. Hartley
was brought up from the penitentiary,
and was the only witness on the stand'
to-day. She stated she was the mother
of the child and Foley its father, and that
Foley made a written acknowledgment
t'nat he was its father in the presence of
a witness. On being askei who that wit
ness was she answered "myself." The
case will go to the jury to-morrow.

convention, whether they came with cre
dentials as representatives of the Asses
sors or whether they came in company
with the Assessors. The motion met with
opposition from Barham of Tenaraa, who
declared that it would give an advantage
to counties which were represented by
both an Assessor and a deputy. He did
not believe it fair that one county should
have more voice in tbe convention tha<<.
another, and said ail should be treated
alike. Tbe motion to amend was voted j

of the committee on credentials was car- ,
Tied.

i amount of amounts so remaining uncolltctfc!, â 
| and upon the trial of such action no defense i

RUSHING TO RANDSBURG.
Mining Craze Started by Reports cf
Rich Strikes at the Dessrt
Ccmp.
LOS ANGELES. Cal., Nov. 24.â The
excitement here over late reports from
the mining district of Ilandsburg is begin
ning to assume almost the proportions of
a craze. People in every walk of life in
nnusual number* are planning to go to
this new El Dorado.
The camp is about fifty miles northeast
from Mojave, on the Southern Pacific
Railroad, and is easily accessible from
that point, as well as from a station on
the Atlantic and Pacific road. Miners re
turning to this city report recent linds of
immense richness. These miners and
their friends and re-'atives are preparing
to return with large invoices of supplies.
Practical mining men, prospectors,
gamblers â men and women of all sorts
and conditions â :tre flooding to the new
camp. Hundreds of others are preparing
to go, and it seems now as though all
previous mining stampedes would be out
done by the rush to Ranrtsburg.
Those who cannot afford to pay the
railroad and stage fares are doing the
next best thing. Some are going by
freight team, some attempt thn journey
on bicycles, while scores of others trudge
along over the burning sand and through
alkali dust on foot.

The proceedings of the Assessors' con

study of all taxpayers. The subjects to be
dealt with are matters of material interest
to the State, and if any plan of reform can
be agreed upon it will undoubtedly be
urged upon the Legislature this winter,
and therefore attention should be given to
it at once.
There is a big volume of political phil
osophy in the statement of Chauncey De

tlie results wnich have come to him by

prudence, bis thrift and his good citizen
ship."
THE ASSESSORS' CONVENTION.
The convention of the Assesors of the
various counties of the State now at Sac
ramento is undoubtedly the most impor
tant gathering at this time witnin the
limits of the commonwealth. It has been
called to consider the very important
problem of tax reform, and its delibera
tions concern not only the revenue of the
State but justice to every taxpayer.
The tax laws of California are at the
present time in Buch a condition that in
justice is inevitable. We have an ever
recurring contest before the State Board
of Equalizers to arrange for justly appor
tioning the taxes between the various
counties, and these contests never end in
satisfactory results. As a matter of fact,
with our present tax laws anything ap
proximating to justice seems impossible.
There have been complaints foi a long
period on this subject, and it is certainly
full time that some steps stiould be taken
toward reforming the evil.
In addition to being unjust and unfair
between counties and between various citi
zens, our tax laws are subject to the fur
ther defect that they entail an altogether
unnecessary greatness of labor and cost.
A large revenue might be saved to the
people by somÂ« simple plan of making tax
assessments and tax collections easier and
cheaper. It should not be d fticult to de
vise some plan for providing a remedy for
the defect of excessive cost, and this much
at least we may hope for from the con
vention.
It should be borne in mind that while
assessors only have oeen called to the
meeting the discussion of the problem will
not be confined altogether to those offi
cials. The Assessors will gladly receive
suggestions from Boards of Trade, Cham
bers of Commerce and taxpayers who
have taken enough interest in the subject
to give it a full consideration. In a cer
tain sense, therefore, the convention will
represent the full wisdom of the State on
the subject with which it has undertaken
to deal, and whatever plan of reform it
may suggest will undoubtedly receive the
careful attention of the Legislature this
winter.
It is too much to expect an ideal system
of taxation from the convention. It has
not been called to consider any such pro
ject. Its aims are simply to amend the
present system by ridding it of existing
defects and providing for a greater equal
ity of taxation upon citizens and various
classes of property. It is essentially,
therefore, a meeting to consider questions
of practical politics, and as such it de
serves all ihe more attention and support
from the pubiip generally.
THE STATE EDITORS.
The annual session of the California
Press Association at Vallejo was in every
respect a most successful one, and will be
recalled with pleasure both by the editors
who were present and by the people of
Vallejo, whose profuse hospitality the
members of the congress enjoyed.
It was noted that the meeting this year
was a remarkably cheerful one. The mem
bers of the association did not come to
gether each with a tale ol woe seeking the
condolences of his fellow members. On
the contrary all were bright, hopeful,
alert and confident of coming piosperity.
They met to sympathize in the brighten
ing prospects of the State, and to give a
renewed pledge of working together for
the welfare of California and the pros
perity of its people.
A notable feature of the occasion was
the address of John P. Irish on the influ
ence of a newspaper in determining the
opinion of outsiders on the condition of
the community in which the paper is pub
lished. Mr. Iri-h very truly said: "The
people of other States take a commuuity
to be what is reflected in the columns of
its press." He cited instances to show the
evil effects produced abroad by sensational
journalism, and wisely commended those
editors who have aimed to make tt.eir
papers represent the dignity, me decency
and the enterprise of the people who sup
port it, rather than a mere record of follies,
> villainies, crimes and indecencies.
It is fortunate for California that as a
whole her newspapers are edited by men
who are concerned mor â  in the publication
of legitimate news and in the advancement
of the industrial prosperity of their vari
ous localities than in exploiting sensa
tions. As a rule the people of California
can safely send to their Eastern friends
the paper which they take in their own
home?, being well assured that a study of
the paper will advance ihe good repute of
the city and the State and not injure it in
the minds of the intelligent.
While this fortunate condition prevails
through the press generally it is not to be
denied that there are striking examples
among us of that pernicious journalism
whicli Mr. Irish justly denounced. It is
the duty of citizens as well as of editors to
be on their pnard against such newspapers.
If the proprietor of a paper should not
degrade his profession to vileness, neither
should the public support him if he does
so.
W T e agree furthermore with Mr. Irish in
his wish that the California Press Associ
ation could go East ones a year and show
the people there what kind of civilization
we have here. We, like him, would be
glad to see our local press held up as a
mirror to the world of what we really are. j
Since this wish, however, is not likely to '
be attained we advise the people of the
various counties of California to send their
local papers to their Eastern friends. Let
the East see what California la and we can
OOUnt on a large immigration of good
settlers in the State.
AMERICAN LIBERTY.
From the short report that has been
given of the oration delivered by Chaun
cey M. Depew on Tuesday, before the
Vermont Society cf the Sons of the Revo
lution, it seems that it will justly take
rank among the ablest addresses which
Mr. Depew lias delivered. It dealt with a
subject of perennial interest to Americans,
and both in sentiment and in eloquence
wus worthy of the occasion and of the
orator.
The theme of the address was Ameri
can liberty and its safeguard in the
American Government. Mr. Depew
painted out that our Government is not
paternal, but is nevertheless a protection
for every man in the full enjoyment of
the profits of his industry. With us lib
erty and law are synonymous terms, and
it is the duty of patriotic societies to in
culcate in the minds of the people those
principles from wnich liberty arises and
on which law is fonnded.
In an eloquent passage, at the close of
his address, the orator said:
Gentlemen, let us learn and teach the prin
ciples upon which our Government has grown
to its great and beneficial proportions; let us
enforce the lesson that American liberty is the
preservation of American opportunely for a
man to rise above the condition in which he
was born, and win honors from his fellowmen
and protection from his country for the re
sults which have come to him by his talents,
his industry, his wisdom, his prudence, his
thrift and his good citizenship.
It will be one of the reasons for our
thanksgiving to-morrow that in the re
cent election the people voted to main
tain those principles which Mr. Depew so
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1896.
eloquently set forth. His address there
fore was timely as well as eloquent. It
comes to tbe public at a time when the
popular mind is well prepared to receive
it, and will no doubt go far to rouse those
patriotic eentiments which it was the ob
ject of the speaker to inculcate.
During the past camj>aign there was an
excessive amount of class prejudice and
patsMon infused into the canvass. At
tempts were made to array the great mass
of the people against a few men simply
because they were wealthy. Those ap
peals were fortunately in vain. The at
tempt to make a dividing line between
the poor and the rich in this country was
futile. Nevertheless we must remember
that the attempt was made with a con
siderable show of success. Therefore we
have reason to pay due attention to the
lesson wnich Mr. Depew has taught, and
do our best to diffuse among all the peo
ple the understanding that American lib
erty is the preservation of American op
portunity and its protection by law.
THANKSGIVING AND CHARITY.
It is hardly necessary to remind the
people of San Francisco that the holiday
season is also the senson of charity. It
has been the custom in this community
to make charitable work as prominent as
the greatest gayeties during the whole
time of festivals from Thanksgiving to
New Year's day. The present season will
be no exception to the rule, and we may
be sure that what is done in the name of
charity this year will fall in no wise short
oi the best efforts this City has ever made.
The custom has been to intrust charita
ble work very largely to associations or
ganized for that purpose. There can be
no question of the benefits of such a ens
torn, since organized effort is generally
better than the scattered attempts of indi
viduals in any kind of undertaking. Nev
ertheless there is much charitable work
that can be better done by individuals
than by institutions, and it. is to this sort
of work that the well-to-do people of the
City should give their attention to-day
while making preparations for Thanks
giving in their own homes.
There are many persons who cannot be
the recipients of organized charity, inas
mucn as they are not within the class
that needs the kind of help for which asso
ciations are founded. These people are
on the edge of society and are more or
less closely associated with their well-to-do
neighbors. They are not only too proud
for alms, but are also above the necessity for
it. They have, however, but scanty reve
nues and little means for thanksgiving in
their own homes, and it is toward them
that the truest and kindest charity should
be turned.
Many a lonely man or woman in the
City would welcome an invitation to join
a happy household at its dinner more
than a mere gift of money. Many a fam
ily whose thanksgiving board will be ill
supplied for the festival would rejoice in
some little luxuiy given in true friendship
and genial kindliness. It is to these ueo
pie ttiat the attention of the kind-hearted
and generous should be turned to-day.
When we spread our feasts to-morrow let
us make our hospitality bountiiui to those
who need it, who could enjoy it most, and
add also to our own enjoyment.
GEORGIA'S NEW SENATOR.
Alexander Stephens Clay, who has recently
been elected to the United States Senate by the
Legislature of Georgia, is a product of the soil
and a Democrat of the Democrats. He was a
poor boy, the son of a poor farmer, and has
worked every day of his liie. He paid for his
education with the money he eurnud in the
sweat of his face, anl by the same process edu
cated himself in the law. On his father's side
Alexander S. Clay.
Mr. Clay is of Scotch descent. His great
grandfather came from Scotland in the middle
of the last century and settled in Virginia.
His grandfather came to Georgia and lived on
a farm in Washington County. There he grew
rich. His father was a Confederate soldier.
Senator-elect Clay was graduated in law in
1876, and has been engaged in the practice of
his profession at Marietta ever since. He bus
always been an active Democrat and has becu
Firominent in Georgia poetics for many years,
n 1884 Mr. Clny was elected to the LÂ«eislature
ana his ability whs at oi>ce recognized, in
1888 ho was unanimously el cUd Speaker of
me lower house. He made a capital record as
a legislator, and as an executive officer was
very successful, fn the convention which
nominated Governor Northern Mr. Clay de
livered the most thrilling speech ever made in
the Georgia capital In nominating- George N.
Lester for Attorney-General. Lester had not
been strong in the convention, but Mr. Clay's
speech carried the delegates off their leet, and
his man swept the convention.
TWO VIEWS OF THE PENSION
QUESTION.
There are two views of the pension ques
tionâone from the "Little Round Top" at
Gettysburg, looking out over a field sown
thickly with the dead, and around upon
bloody, blackened and maimed men cheering
the shot-torn banner of their country; the
other from an office desk on a busy street, or
from an endowed chair in a university, look
ing ouly upon a statistical table. When our
rich men take to fighting our wars we can
abolish the pension system, but thus far it is
as historically true of the armies that won our
independence and saved the Nation' in the
great Civil War as of the kingdom of heaven
â"not many rich."â Ex-President Harrison in
Ladies' Home Journal.
FROM A LOVELORK SWAIN.
Philadelphia Record.

Mr. Chamberlain, Commissioner of Naviga
tion, in his annual report calls attention to
the fact that Japan is capturing the trade of
the Pacific, and therefore he says it is ex
tremely desirable that Congress pass a free
shipping bill. Well, this is only one of the
important particulars in which the Repub
lican administration, after v gets lairly
inaugurated in Washington, may be depended
upon to improve the material interests of the
United States and iv people. It is a matter of
regret that this country, so great in almost
everything, should ever have allowed that
once conspicuous element of its powerâ its
shipping interestâ to suffer decadence.
WHERE, OH, WHERE?
New York tun.
Where is Hon. Coin Harvey, that mighty
silver financier, in these solemn hours for so
many gentlemen in hisline of business? Is he
secreted in the eaves of thought, preparing
himself for even greater triumphs of mind
than his masterpiece, "Coin's Financial
School," was? Is he moping over the fact tnat
his hoarded gold has not jumped up as he ex
pected? Or has he uplifted his voice so high
that it has not yet come down to the ears of an
anxious world? Of one thing we may be sure :
Wherever Hon. Coin Harvey is, tho finest
silver thought is shining and rattling; and by
the brightness and the sound of it *il the
neighboring geese are entranced.

A DAINTY NIGHTGOWN
The lingerie of to-day is affected most de
cidedly by the prevailing styles, adding much
to its picturesqueness and detracting none
from its comfort, for the wide sleeve is in night
dresses a great comfort and certainly wears
well, saving the strain on tne yoke often occa
sioned by fitted dresses.
The gown shown here is made with a yoke
back; a very shallow yoke in front holds the
gathers in place. This is finished in some
gowns by a small turnover collar, which mar
be made of embroidery or the goods. The yoke
points may be edged with a ruffle of the same
embroidery.
Other .-owns have a large round or square
collar of the goods or of all over embroidery
or oi alternate stripes of lace and the goods. '
For ordinary use a gown of whtte musiin is
most sensible. This may be made very pretty
by making the large collar of lawn, or the
collar may be of colored batiste, which washes
very well.
Very elaborate gowns of nainsook are tucked
down the front or trimmed with narrow in
sertion.
This same shape is seen in misses' lounging
robes, which may be of any material from the
cheap outing flannels to silk wadded or lined
with flai.nel.
A dainty gown of pink flannel had the large
collar of white batiste trimmed with a narrow
'edge of Vaiincennes lace and insertion to
match, brought bui half an inch from the
edge.
An outing flannel of blue with wbite stripes
had a round collar of white China silk edged
with a riffle oi lace.
Another of wool challie, with a yellow flower
on a white ground, had a collar of yellow china
silk with lawn and insertion of Valenciennes

WHY FOSTER WENT
OVER TO HAWAII
Hb Tried to Help Spalding
and His Cable, but
Without Avail.
The Hawaiians, He Says, Expect
Japan to Build a Cable,
Ere Long.
Meantime They Are Extremely Anx
ious for Annexationâ Lots of
Sugar and Money.
Ex-Secretary John W. Foster, who went
to Hawaii several weeks ago, returned
yesterday on vhe steamer City of Peking.
It was believed when he left San Fran
cisco that he was probably goin* on some
diplomatic mission and might extend his
trip to Japan. Tne cx-Becretary, how
ever, denies this. He said:
"I went down to Honolulu purely for
pleasure and recreation," said ex-Secre
tary Foster, "and my trip had no business
significance. Mrs. Foster and i both
needed a change, and that was our reason
for going.
"However, Mr. H. Z. Spalding, who
has the cable concession from Hawaii,
learning that I was going down there any
way, besought me while in the East to do
my best to get the Hawaiian Government
to extend tbe time for building the cable.
"It was for this reason that I consented
to do what I could for him. But when
the matter came up the officials of the
Government felt that it would be wise on
their part not to do anything now. They
I thought Hawaii waa sure eventually to
| get a cable.
"Japan is expected to build this way,
I and it is believed that country will cer
tainly build to Honolulu while the spirit
of enterprise is upon the Japanese.
''Tne Hawaiian officials and the people
are oxtremely anxious to have the islands
annexed to tne United States. 1 have no
doubt that after the inauguration of Mr.
McKinley they will try hard to have the
country annexed.
"Tbe islands are quite prosperous.
There has been a big sugar crop, and with
the good prices for suear a large amount
of money has been distributed.
"There was great interest in the elec
[ tion. Tbe victory of Major McKinley was
j not known there till two weeks after the
election."
Mr. Foster is looking well since his visit
ito the tropical islands. He says the trip
did him a great deal of good. The ex-
Secretary ana Mrs. Foster left for Wash
ington last evening.

Tobaccoâ J. F. M., city. Historically, to
bacco was found in use among the Indians ot
America at the time of its discovery in 1492.
and it was associated with tneir solemn trans
actions. It was unknown in the Old World be
fore that time. It wns introduced in to Europe
about 1559 by a Spanish physician, who
brought a small quantity from America into
Spain and Portugal. From there its me was
spread into France and Italy. It is said that it
nas freely used by Â£pauiarda in Yucatan
in 1520. Tobacco was either first brought into
England iv 15G5 by Sir John Hawkins, or by
Sir Walter Kaioigh and Sir Francis Brake in
1580, when tobacco taverns became as preva
lent as alehouses. Its use was opposed by
both priests and rulers. In 1584 a proclama
tion was issued against it. James I pub
lished "A Counterblast Against Tobaico," and
the star chamber placed the duty on tobacco
at G shillings 6 pence per pound, 1614 It.
I cultivation in England was proh bited by
j Charles II in 1684. It is asserted that ii
Highest of all in Leavening Power. Latest U.S. Gov't Report

was at the fled Bull Inn, Isling
ton, Englaud, that tobacco was first
smoked in England. It is doubtful whetner
tobacco us a iiarcoiic was known in the E.ist
before the discovery of America. Meyen, in
his geography oi p ants, expresses the opinion
that the smoking Of tobacco is of great an
tiquity with the .ch/nese, because on v ry old
scu ptures he observed the very same obaeco
pipes that are in use at the present time.
His authority is greater as a botanist than as
an aro.h(;Oiogist and cannot be received as de
cisive uf the ani:quity of the sculi turc of
which he wrote. It is probable, but not
certain, ti.ai the smoking of tobacco
tins iong b'.-'Mi practiced by the Chinese.
The smoking of tobticco was found by
Columbus a practice in tbe West Indies where
the natives made it in'o cyliudr cal rolls,
wrapped in maize leaf. There is no reference
to the use ol tobacco by Shakespeare, yet ii
was well kuown in EagWkÃ 1 in his time.
"THE HUMP" MUST GO.
Work of the Polk-Street Improvement
Clubâ Some Peculiar Features
About Electric Lights.
At the meeting of the Polk-street Im
provement Club last evening the execu
tive committee presented a report show
ing that the Sutter-street line has already
made a concession in the matter of trans
fers ai. the request of the club. Transfers
are now issued at Sacramento street
which enables passsngers to leave the cars
at that point, do business on Polk street
and then use their transfers on Sutter
street. The report also announced that
the California-street line will also make
some arrangement in the matter of trans
fers.
This committee also announced that the
special committee bad presented a pe
tition to the Supervisors asking for the
removal of "the hump" on Polk street,
and that the rantter had been referred to
the City Engineer.
The club decided to join the Association
of Improvement Clubs, and the following
were named a? delegates: L. H. Kohn.
N. Bibo. W. P. Humphreys, James Den
man and William Freese.
Mr. Bradbury stated in relation to the
hump that Warren & Malley had stated
that they would remove it for $2500 cash,
and if an as-essment district was created,
as they own 200 feet Irontage on the
hump, they would bid $6000 to remove it,
they paying their share of the assessment.
Mr. Denman said that if the City Eugi
neer gave an honest estimate of ihe cost
of the woric no assessment district could
be formed. The law. he sain, requires
that the estimate must be not less than 50
per cent of tae value of the property, and
that in this case the estimate would be
fixed as it had been te:ore at about $20,
-000. He thought there was a joker in the
scheme for an assessment district and
warned the club to act with care.
After a discussion, in which several
members took part, it was stated that it is
the intention of the club to have the street
cut through and take some other measure
in regard to the change of grade of inter
mediate streets.
A statement was made that Mr. Morrow,
president of the Sutter-street Railroad
Company, had stated that as soon as the
street is opened the Polk-street line will
be extended to the beach.
Mr. Dennian urged the club to use its
influence, tn conjunction with other im
provement clubs, to have the .Legislature
change the law so as to enable grades to
be changed. Such a change, he said,
would be worth millions of dollars to the
City.
President Kohn said that the club will
rush the removal of the hump, and will
look after grades !ater on.
Mr. Lewin of the special committee on
electric lights, reported that the Mutual
Company would iurnisti lights for $1 75
for which tbe club is now paying $3, and
urged tne club to enter into a contract
with that company to take effect at the
termination of the present six months'
contract. A motion to that effect was
carried.
During a discussion on lights it was de
veloped that the Edison Light Comparry
does not reduce its rates, but on yearly
contracts makes a rebate of 10 per cent
when the bills amount to $50 a week; that
stockholders in this company own a con
trolling interest in the Western Eiectr'u
Light Company and in the Harbor Light
Company; that these two companies act
independently, but when the Mutual
enters into competition with tbe Edison ?
this company draws out and allows one of *
the two other companies to enter into com
petition and furnish lights as low as $1 50.

creating the trust may be introduced for
the purpose of showing that there was no
duress or unsoundness of tnind in con
nection with the making of the trust cre
ated by the will of August 13, 1895. This
decision places the Fair children and their
attorneys in a most embarrassing position,
because it was their intention, if tbe Su
preme Court's decision on the trust were
against them, to attack the will on the
ground that the maker was insane. The
present contest on the part of Charles L.
Fair is to bring the question ot the valid
ity of the trust before the Bupreme Court
without permitting the will itself to be
ruled upon.
Some time in the future be may wish to
contest that will and he does not want to
be prevented by a iinal judgment. UDon
this subject the formidable array of legal
lights representing tbe various elements of
the three-cornered case was engaged all of
j yesterday, each side conceding some things
to the others.
Attorney Van R. Paterson said yester
day, addressing Judge Slack:
"Unless your Honor changes his mind
we all know what your decision in recard
to the trust is." This reference was to the
ruling some time since in which Judge
Slack declared against the validity of the
personal property clause of the trust dÂ»ed.
"We," said Garret McEnerney for the
trustees under the trust deed and ad
dressing his le^al opponents, "either own
this real property or you own it ; that's all
I there is about it. li ihis trust is valii the
' property is ours.
"What you should attack is the will
creating this trust. We claim that Sena
! tor Fair is dead ; that he made this will
creating this deed of trust; that it was his
last will, and that he wa3 of sound and
disposing mind when he made it."
The case will oe resumed in Judge
Slack's court next Saturday morning.
A few diys since the Examiner, in keeD
ixljE with its customary untruthfulness,
published the statement that a startling
discovery had been made In the Fair will
contest to the effect that Messrs.
j "Corvallhe and Ames, the New Yorlc ex
| perts on handwriting, had declared that
they had decided that the s.gnatures to
the trust deed, the pencil and the other
will, were all the same, as though traced
exactly from one original. " How evidently
"faked" was that statement may be judged
from the reproduction herewith furnished
from accurate tracnns made yesterday for j
The Call of photographsof the three doc- 1

Shortridge.
It will be seen by careful comparison
that not one letter corresponds exactly

with another of the same kind; that no
one could be superposed so that it would
coincide exactly with another; nor are
the spacings and phadings the same in the
different signatures. The claim was made
that because a man never writes his signa
ture exactly the same way twice, these
signatures, because of their alleged
uniformity to one copied design, were
certainly all copied from a single original.
The experts themselves are now in this
Ciiy. Their reputations are too valuable
to be forfeited by such a statement as that
wrongfully credited to them.
The attorneys for J. J. Cooney in his
libel suit against Charles L. Fair gave no
tice yesterday that they propose on Fri
day next to move that the suit he dis
missed on the ground that the $500 dam
age bond has not been tiled.
In regard to the suit of Jerome Caldwell
and the giving to the public of Senator
Fair's characteristic private letters there
arc two or three lacts that may be of in
terest.
These letters, extending over a period
from 1858 to the date of James G. Fair's
deatn, supplied valuable examples of the
handwriting of James G. Fair. It was
upon such a comparison of these very let
ters that it was publicly stated * that
Charles L. Fair and his sisters and their
attorneys came to the positive conclusion
that the pencil will was genuine. When
the letters were sent by Catdwell to
Charles L. Fair Fair solemnly promised
that he would return them upon Cald
well s request.
Caldwell himself during the last few
months has rep atediy asked for their re
turn and a few weeks ago, unsolicited,
asked Del mas & tihortridge to secure the
letters for him. Monday, before. the suit
was brought, a formal demand in writing,
accompanied by copies of all of the letters,
was served Dersonally on Charles L. Fair.
He then refused to state whether he would
or would not return the letters. A
few hours afterward a second mes
senger was sent to him and saw
one of his attorneys, to whom Fair
had referred the matter, and who then
told the messenger that if Mr. Uelmas
concluded that they would not return the
letters Â»v conclusion would be correct.
Tne result of stfth an answer to a formal
demand left but one course open under
Caldwell's instructions to his attorneys.
Suit was at once commenced, and since
it was a suit for specific delivery of pei
sonal property, that property had to he
specifically described. So far as Caldwell's
interests are concerned, it is asserted that
he has absolutely nothing to do with any
litigation that has been commenced or
carried on by Dr. Marc Levingston or Mrs.
Craven.

The schools comprising the Academic

The football teams of th a ieague have
been playing two months every Saturday
afternoon since October 17 and the con
tests of the coming Saturday are among
tbe best teams of the eleven. Each team
has had to play three games with others,
the loss by any one of more than one of
these three games disqualifying the school
from further part in tne tournament.
St. Matthew's School cf San Mateo is
looked upon almost as a sure winner of
the championship, but a football game is
never won until the last whistle blows.
The Oakland High School, because of its
proximity to tbe Berkeley campus and
the information acquired by often watch
ing the college players, is considered a
likely candidate for second place.
STAGE RAIN AND NO WATER.
Jenny Ward Hays to Build a >ovel
Electrical Apparatus.
A bright little woman of versatile ideas
an J considerable experience in a theatri
cal and musical way arrived here yester
day for the purpose of having constructed
in this City a new electrical device, of her
own creation, to produce stage effects rep
resenting dasiiine waterfalls and torrents
of raindrops without the use of a drop of
water. She is Jenny Ward Hays of Chi
cago, who began her professional career as
a child elocutionist at 8 years of age.
When she was 12 years old she appeared
in such a role in this City in the course of
a tourof the whole country. Subsequently
she studied music in Milan, Italy, and re
turned 10 America to follow for years the
profession of music and acting, during
the pursuit of which slie branched out
into tbe composition of numerous pieces
of vocal and instrumental music and the
production of a long list of dramas, com
edies and monologues.
She has consulted with several skillful
and experienced constructing electricians,
and they have told her that ber ideas for
the creation of novel spectacular stage
effects are practical. One of these elec
tricians, himself an inventor. ha 9 come
out from the East to aid in the making
and perfecting of the necessary apparatus,
the work on which Miss Hays will per
sonally direct, while she will help in the
manual part as well. She hopes to
have the mechanism constructed at the
end of six weeks. Her plan embraces
not only real rain*and fountain effects,
but bursts of bright sunshine following a
summer siiowÂ»r and Its accompaniment of
thunder and lightning.
"I have always felt," said she yester
day, "that there is something lacking in
stage storms. With ail ttieir appearances
tht-y never have any rain. After observ
ing Edison's vitascope 1 began to study
the matter of producing complete storm
and water effects, and I have planned an
elaborate apparatus for the purpose. Of
course a rain effect alone would not do, so
I uetermined to increase tne repertoire
that my invention might be more gen
erally useful and at the same time more
valuable as a theatrical apparatus. I have
arranged a dance where a naiad may
rise and disport herseif fi-racefully in the
midst of an apparently drenching water
fall and an umbrella dance in which a
little maid caught out in the rainstorm
just preceding appears in the flashing sun
shine. lam also striving lor a real flah
of lightning that will appear to strike the
umbrella, but may have to abandon it be
cause of the danger among so many sur
rounding electric wires."

A NEW STEAMER
FOR HAWAII'S ISLE
Had Her Trial Trip on
the Bay Yesterday
Morning.

The Credit of Savins the San B:nito's
Crew Ii Given to the
Weeott.
The Hawaiian steamer James Spiers bad
ber trial trip on the bay yesterday. A de
scription of tbe vessel has already been
published in The Call. On the trial spin
down the bay and against the flood tide
she made better time than the builders ex
pected, and with the tide sh* made better
than fourteen knots an hour. All in all,
tbe new vessel has surpas-ed anticipations
and is a credit to San Francisco. In a few
days she will leave for Honolulu and will
take ber place in the Inter-island Naviga
tion Company's fleet. The James Spier
has splendid cabin accommodations and
almost every berth has already been en
gaged for the voyage to Hawaii.
Tbe hull of the new steamer was built by
Matthew Turner and the machinery was
put in by the Fulton Iron Works, of
which James Spiers is president.
The steam schooner Alcatraz got in
from the wreck of the San Benito yester
day afternoon. Sue was caught in the
same gale that proved tbe undoing of the
atout collier, and at one time the steam
schooner was in danger. Off Greenwood
City the Alcatraz was hove to, and during
tbe night the San Beniio passed her en
route tor Ban Francisco. It was blowing
a hurricane at the time and the forecastle
of the Alcairaz was flooded and rhe crew
had to board up the companionway in
order to keep the place dry. All tbe men
lived forward during the remainder oi the
trip, and they say that never has the Al
catraz been through a wilder storm. When
off Point Arena the wreck of tne San Be
nito was sighted and the ateam schooner
stood by. According to the crew tbe sav
ing of the men in the rigging of the
stranded collier must go to the credit of
Mate Thompson and three of tbe men of
the steamer Wceott. They ran all kinds of
risks, v/hile others looked on, and took
the men out of the rigging while those
ashore and those on the vessels at sea
held their breath in expectation of seeing
the brave fellows dashed to death. Too
much praise cannot be given to tbe officers
and crews of the Point Arena, Weeott and
Alcatraz. All three vessels stood by the
stranded wreck, and in spite of wind and
weather and the loss of time, hung on
until every soul that could be saved was
safe aboard one or other of the steamers.

A revolution has taken place on the
terry steamer El Capitan. Formerly only
one crew was employed; now there are
two, and tbe little boat is on the same
footing as the Bay City and Encinal.
When CaDtain Rogers went on watch he
found that hundreds of the passengers

OPENED LAST EVENING.
Amid Scenes of Picturesque Carnage
the Finest Marketing I'laoe in the
Country Formally Opens Up.
The new Union - square Market at the
corner of Powell and O Farrell streets
formally opened last night under most
auspicious circumstances. Elaborate pre
parations bad been made throughout the
market for the occasion, and the various
stalls were dressed in the most becoming
style. The Park band was in attendance
and rendered sweet discourses amid the
scene of picturesque carnage.
The Union-square Market is a new and
handsome place which was especially con
structed for its present accupanta, the for
mer tenants of the old Center market on
Sutter street and Grant avenue. It is one
of the largest and finest marketing places
in this country. The reputation ot the
merchants who occupy this new establish
ment is too well known to require any
extended commendation, many of them
having been tenants of the old Center
market ever since it opened up, twenty
years ago.
Although the marketmen moved into
their new home last month, the formal
opening has been deferred until this even
ing on account of the several arrange
ments in tbe interior of the building mat
nas been going on, as well as the manage
ment having awaited the advent of
Thanksgiving as a more opportune time
for suc-h an occasion. The market is most
centrally located and offers conveniences
that no other does. It has two handsome
entrances.
To-day and to-night the new building
wili wear its eala attire of toothsome
viands to which it is devoted. All are in
vited to attend.
THANKSGIVING FESTIVAL.
.Entertainment of the Center Norris,
Pacific ttreet and Produce Ex
change Kindergartens.
One hundred and forty-five little ones,
pupils of the Lester Norris, the Produce
Exchange and Pacific-street kinder
gartens, enjoyed their annual Tnanks
jriving party at the rooms of the Norris
Kindergarten on Pacific street.
At tbe annual festival Mr-. 13. F. Norris
always officiates, and the bountifully
spread table and little souvenirs are all
the gifts of the generous patroness.
The kindergartens are under the direc
tion of Miss Bella Scott, assisted by Miss
Benedict, Miss Tregloan and Miss Cogh
lan.
The programme of exercises reflected
great credit upon the teachers and the in
telligent little lads and lassies. The chil
dren vary m ages from 18 months to 6
years, and each seemed to vie with tbe
other in tbe fulfillment of his part of
tbe morning entertainment.
The complete programme of the exer
cises was as follows:
Ring song; prayer; greeting; popcorn;
woodchopper; raindrops; waffle game; "Oh,
Bee our pretty windows"; "Who has a wel
come for father?" "Little squirrel."
Mrs. Cooper and Miss Cooper, who have
never for the past sixteen years missed one
of these festivals, were prevented on ac
count of Mrs. Cooper's illness from being
present.
Along the west coast of Africa there are
new 225 churches, 40,000 converts, 100,000

HOW A PRELATE
KEEPS HIS HEALTH
Bishop John P. Newman
Tells of His Regular
Exercise.
He Alludes to His Church Work
and His Experience With
Grant.
The Bisto? Will Preach To-Morrow
and Will B Given a Reception
on Friday.
The Rev. John P. Newman, D.D.,
LL.D., Bishop of the Metnodist Epiacpal
Church, and Mrs. Newman arrived here
from New Yort yesterday, and are at the
Occidental.
The eminent Bishop looks much as be
did when on his last visit to California.
He says, however, he is slightly lighter,
weighing but 195 pounds, whereas he used
to weigh 208.
'â But I find that that is as much as is
consistent with piety," said the distin
guished gentleman last night as he smiled
and talked of his health. "I carry my
gymnasium apparatus with me. It con
sists of pullies aud ropes or chest weignts
for exercising the shoulders, arms and
body. 1 formerly used dumbbells and
other similar apparatus, but 1 found they
were too severe for me. I learned that
lighter exercise was better. I eat very
little, walk a good deal, and everything
considered, manage to keep in excellent
health.
"I am the fourth Methodist Episcopal
Bishop sent to California. The first was
Bishop Peck, the next was Fowler and the
last was Goodsell. I had a choice of five
places and from tbe five chose California.
A Biahou in the Methodist church travels
oftentimes forty weeks in the year. My
postoffice for tbe past eight years has been
Omaha. For the next lour it will be here.
"From what I learn our rjeopie
are prosperous in this State, and the
church is doing fairly well. They ex
pect hard work from me, I believe, for
there are a good many churches to dedi
cate and other work to do. On Thanks
giving we will have a union service at the
Central M. E. Church on Howard street.
"This is my sixth visit to this State. I
was here last in 1890, after I was elected
Bishop, while en route to the Sandwich
Inlands and Japan. I was also here in
1885, and came previously with Senator
Stanford. I was witn President Grant for
nine years, or from the time he was in
augurated till he died."
Tbe Bishop inquired about the rivalry
between Stanford and Berkeley nniversi
ties, and &aid he liked to see it, provided
there was no bitterness. He also asked
about the condition of the Stanford Uni
versity, in which he had always ta&en a
great interest.
"If I had a son," said the Bishop, "I
would have him become a journalist. I
thick it is there that a greater influence
can be exerted than in any other profes

BRYAN RECEIVES
CHEERS AT DENVER
Visit of the Boy Orator
to the Capital of
Colorado.
Everybody Turns Out to See
the Defeated Silver
Candidate.
Driven in a Carrisg? Through
Crowded Streets the Nebraskan
Gets an Ovation.
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 24.â Cheers that
found their echoes in the mountains rent
the air as William Jennings Bryan stepped
from his train at7:-'JO o'clock this morn
ing told the silver leader that he was wel
come in tlie Queen City. Mr. Bryan had
come to Denver to view the vanguard of
his army, and found it ready for another
contest 2.30,000 strong. Sucli a welcome
as he received hits never beer, accorded
to another man in the West. The crowd
that cheered him filled the station, ex
tending into Sixteenth street, and fringed
the long viaduct that reached over the
railroad yards and the river into North
Denver, three-quarters of a mile away.
The reception committee, headed by \
Hon. X. M. Patterson and aided by a j
squad of police,, worked like Trojans to
get him to hi.s carriage, and the crowd I
v warmed around the carriage shouting '
Ind cheering, and accompanied him to
the residence of Hon. C. S. Thomas, where
lie took Dreakfast with the reception coni
jnitiee. Each mouthful they ate was j
punctuateJ with cheers from without, and
every few momeao a nonnd wave j
.greater than the other arose, caused j
by the words of some impromptu speaker, |
who would ask, "What's the matter i
with Bryan ?" and t lie answer, "He's all
right," would be rolled back in a voice of
thunder. At the Brown Hotel at 10 o'clock j
the women of the city tendered a recep- I
tion. The front of the building for nine
stories was banked with flowers, and when j
Mr. Bryan was introduced there was a '
scene of excitement that moved high. I
Mrs. Mary <.'. Bradford made a brief speeru i
and presented him with a memorandum I
book of Colorado chased silver. The ob
verse side bears the seal of Colorado and j
sixteen silver miners and one gold pick, j
On the reverse side is a picture of the Mount !
of the Holy Cross and a fac-simile engrav- I
ing of the silver dollar, surrounded with !
columbines, the State flower.
Mr. T. M. Patterson introduced the j
speaker, who paid a tribute to tne women j
by speakins first ot his wife, whom he said j
he fcoped would be the rirst lady of the I
land in fact, and though defeated, he said
ttiat to him she had always been the first
laoy ot the land. He acknowledged the !
yorK done by the women, not only tho^e '
with the right of suffrage, Out those with- j
out, and concluded by saying that he !
would trust the women always, for they
were always found on the right side of !
every great question.
A reception was held at which Mr. j
Bryan shook hands with all who came to j
him. This consumed nearly two iiours,
when he was driven to lunchi and the pro- j
gramme of the afternoon was carried out. |
This included s carriage ride over the 1
city. The streets were packed and Dlack I
with people. Just space enough was left!
by the crowd for the carriage to proceed !
in to move forward. The vehicle moved !
through an ocean ot sounds that rolled up j
between the high walls of the buildings j
and made the ear-drums sore with its
deafening din. Flowers were thrown at
him ana people alongside the carriage j
screamed to attract his attention, almost ]
wild in their enthusiasm. Block after |
block, mile after mile was passed in this |
manner, and the sentiment of the crowd i
seemed to be that if ho failed in 1890 the
future held in its clasp victory in 1900.
"Wouldn't he make an ideal President?" |
shouted some one. and immediately the \
crowd began to shout, "We'll stay with '
Billy!" "You're our leader!" ''We're
with you first, last and all the time! " and
the like. At the corner of Sixteenth and
Lawrence streets there was an outburst
cf enthusiasm that stopped tne progress of
the carriage. The people flowed into the
street and jammed up against the car
riage.
When Mr. Bryan rose to utter a few
words he simply remarked that though de
feated tne people here were equally as
happy as those East. "Our enemies," as
he terms them, were in their victory.
This sentiment pleased the crowd, and for
live minutes it yelled until it seemed as
though the noise would shatter the win
dow panes. Then the carriage moved on.
The next stopping-place was at the State
Capitol grounds, where f>ooo school-chil
dren were to welcome him. The streets
that face the grounds were packed with
people; the grass was covered with chil
dren, carrying flags and flowers ana wee
bits of children. The wild crowd that
surrounded the ground taxed the powers
of the police to hold it back. It was a
scene of simplicity and youth. The little
ones screamed in delight at the sight of
Bryan. Their elders roared in deeper
tones. The noise was frightful and con
stantly growing in volume.
As the carriage ascended the hill to the
entrance of the buildings the cheering
reached its height as Mr. Brva:i arose in
the carriage for an address. The children I
swept up the hill, followed by the crowd
that broke through the line of police like |
an invading army until they were wedged j
in about the carriage so closely that it was
impossible for anybody to move. Mr.
Bryan's voice could scarcely be heard as
he accepted from Mrs. Dora" Phelps Buell â 
a flag, the present of the East Denver I
High School. The words they oxpected I
could not be heard. The cheers became '
more frequent, the noise greater, and then
the whole crowd that overran the grounds
cave way to its feelings and cheered untii
it was hoarse.
After this Mr. Bryan made a brief ad
dress and, escorted by a juvenile military
tifoop, his carriage was about to proceed
onward, when tne Newsboys' Union, with
banners and flags, crowded forward and
gave him such a reception as only street
urchins know how to give. The crowd
was now so aense that it was hard to move !
one way or the other. The police were i
powerlesp. Mr. Bryan was in the liands '
of his iriends. Then one oflicer pointed to '
the foot of the bill, and the crowd that ]
could see, but not hear, thinking the car- j
riage would ascend the bill, swept down it I
like an avalanche. This left room for the
carriage which moved down Seventeenth 'â 
avenue. At Seventeenth and Broadway i
another big crowd, enough to populate a
city, was waiting, and for the want of any- j
thing better to do, wea cheering because
they knew Mr. Bryan was coming. Only
ft few words were spoken here and then lie
WÂ«3 driven back to the Thomas home, i
Where dinner was served.
At 7 :30 o'clock to-night the doors of the
First Presbyterian Cburch were opened.'
It was the original intention to have -Mr.
Bryan speak for a lecture course, an.U
tickets were sol 1. . When he was upheaved i
into such prominence by the political j
campaign, tho management waned its
right i! the few ticket-holders should be
guaranteed, and the church was opened to
u.J. It was filled to ike doors, while others

[From a photograph by liuxhnell.]
clamored outside for admission. Mr.
Bryan spoke for three quarters of an hour.
This is the anniversary of the admission
of Colorado to the sisterhood of States,
and his theme was "Colorado." The word
was entwined in flowers on the altar and
the figures 1870-liSHG on either side. The
building was decorated with flowers. His
remarks were appropriate to the occasion
as dealing with ihe progress of tho State
In twenty years. Outside a fine of people
extended to the Brown Palace Hotel
where the Chamber of Commerce banquet
wan to occur, and the people assembling
there knew every time when Mr. Bryan
madn a telling point in the church by "me
cheers which came from inside the edifice
which were c&npht up by the crowds and
carried down the streets as if traveling
over a telephone wire.
It was 9 o'clock j*fsen Mr. Bryan reached
the Brown hotel. The banquet-room v\as
crowded awaiting the inipearance of the
uuest of the evening. When he appeared
he was greeted with great applause. Rev.
Myron W. Reed, the toastmaster, made a
few remarks, and Hon. Henry P. Steele,
president o< the Chamber of Commerce,
Mayor McMnrray for the city and Gov
ernor Mclntyre for the State delivered
addresses of welcome. Governor-elect
Adams made a short speech on the re
sources of the new West, folio weft by
Senaior Teller on the business outlook,
and then Congressman Towne of Minne
sota delivered an aJdress on the campaign
of 1900 as an opening wedge to the re
marks of Mr. Bryan, who arose at the con
clusion of Sir. Towne's speech. He was
greeted with applause, after which he
spoke at great length.

FOR SHOUTING FOR SETAN
Fatal Shooting of a Ulan Who Baniered
Some Xegroet.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 24.â That all
the election excitement is not over in this
part of the country was shown this morn
ing by a fatal shooting affair that took
place in the street. K. Lawrence Schobel,
unfortunately for himself, thought that
matters bad quieted down and found Â£hat
be was mistaken.
Schobel was passing along Nineteenth
street this morning, when he saw a group
of negroes engaged in a noisy political dis
cussion. In a bantering way, as he passed
them heshoutel. "Hurrah ior Bryan."
The response was more rapid and ener
getic than he had expected. Several of
the negroes angrily answered him, and
one drew a pistol and shot at him. The
bullet struck him in the stomach. He fell
to the sidewalk and the negroes, fright
ened at what they had done, ran away.
Help was summoned and Schobel was
taken to a hospital. The doctors say that
be cannot live.
The negro who fired the fatal shot has
not yet been found, but the police say
that where there were so many witnesses
he cannot escape.

TRAVELERS TO
HOLD A FAIR
Enterprise Proposed by
Leading Commercial Men
of This City.
Four Associations May Join
Hands to Promote the Suc
cess of the Scheme.
Annual Meeting and High Jioksof the
Pacific Coast Commercial Trav
elers' Association.
The commercial travelers of San Fran
cisco who belong to various associations
contemplate the holding of a great fair in
this City. The leading organizations in
terested in the project are the Pacific Coast
Travelers' Association, the Travelers' Pro
tective Association, the San Franciaco
Travelers' Association and the United
Commercial Travelers. The fact that
elaborate preparations have been made by
commercial travelers in New York to raise
$]f>o,ooo to build a home for traveling men
there has encouraged the local represen
tatives to action on the same line.
Mr. Sioss, one of the directors of the
Pacific Coast Travelers' Association, will
on his way to Europe make observations
of the New York scheme, and note the
form and scope of the fair in that city.
J. C. Eubank<i, president of the Pacific
Coast Travelers' Association, says the fair
to be held in Ban Francisco will have for
its purpose the establishment of a bed in
eacu ot the leading hospitals. The build
ing of a home h an enterprise of such
magnitude that the local travelers do not
feel justified in advocating it at the pres
ent time. Before the fair or entertain
ment is held a conference must take place
in which all of the Pacific Coast associa
tions shall be represented.
The time and place of holding the fair
will be determined in due season. A gen
eral interchange of views ha 3 demon
strated a desire for united effort.
The next annual meeting of the associa
tion, of which Mr. Eubauks i-< president
and A. C. Boldemunn secretary and treas
urer, will take place at the Native Sons'
building on Mason street Tuesday, I)e
-cem ber 29.
Proof sheets of the proposed new con
stitution and by-laws which will then be
submitted to the association have been
inclosed to all the member*. The annual
cession will last perhaps for several days.
When the regular business is concluded,
t lie annual high jinks will clÂ«im tho atten
tion of the travelers.
The association is in a nourishing con
dition. The treasury contains $10,000 and
the outlook for the luture is bright.

senior British counsel, and Hon. Don. M.
Dickinson, senior counsel < for the United
States. ; J V:. " r
The formal proceedings opened and
Chandler P. Anderson of New York was
chosen secretary. T When rules of pro
cpdure were taken up both sides'ngrped on
all butone, and nere tuey were diametric
ally opposed. Peters wanted the:. Ca
nadian claims dealt with singly,
put to this Dickinson strongly ob
jected, arguine that the British should put
in all their claims, and then the United
States put in only its defense at San
Irancisoo. Peters replied that it might
not be necessary to sit at San Francisco. "
The point was finally settled in lavor of
the British contention. Sixteen British
claim?, totaling $459,500, "and with interest
added from the tune of seizure of the
sealing vessels, were tiled to-day, and ten
more will follow to-morrow. "

DEVOTION OF A DOG.
" Baby " Itassette l>ied anil His Pet
Starved by tho Kudy.
For three lop.g days and nights the p et
i dog of Paul Bassette kept solitary watch
; over the dead body of his master, says an
; exchange. During all this time the faith
; ful brute had absolutely no food and not
â¢ a drop of water. But for the piteous
: howls of the starving and emaciated
I creature attracting attention to the room
j where Bassette had lived like a hermit the
1 dog would have died at his post and lain
j there a sacrifice to such unreasoning af-
I fection as aojts only are capable of.
Paul liassette was (>"> years of ace and
; lived on Tompkins street, Orange Valley,
N. J. He worked as a hatter in the "No
Name" hatstiop on Mitchell street. Being
*> leet f> inches bigh ana innocent he has
for the last twenty years been known as
"Baby Bassette."
He lived alone in one room, always
shunning society and having for sole com
; panion a little mongrel dog. He kept en
; tireiy to himself and the fact oi his ab
j sence, either around his home or at Ins
j work, was to all the world such an unim
â  portant matter that for months it might
! have remained unnoticed. He hail only
j his dog to care for him. Ho cared for
: nothing else.
Yesterday a woman named Julia Ed
| wards heard the heart-breaking lamenta
\ tions and she called assistance to investl
| gate.
On entering Bassette's room a ghastly
j spectacle was seen. Upon the squalid bed
I lay the body of the man, in such a state
i that it was readily seen that ne must have
\ been dead a week.
By his side lay the shaggy doÂ», moaning
piteously ana trying wnli his canine ca
resses to rouge his master back to life. By
starvation reduced almost to skin and
bone, so feeble that it could hardly stand,
the mouth parched and shriveled by
thirst, the poor brute had lingered by the
remains of its only friend silently suffer
ing until the pangs of hunger had forced
from it the feeble howls which had led to
the discovery. â Chicago News.
Caught.
Apparently obvious of the fact that he
was pursnea by a determined lookintr man
on a wheel the scorcher flew down the
smoothly paved street. His back was
humped, his head with jts rubber neck
attachment was thrust forward, and his
feet flew mechanically up and down like
the dashers of a double - action steam
churn.
With eyes fixed steadfastly upon the
scorcher the pursuer tore along the high
way. His teeth were firmly set, his lips
pressed tightly together, and a look "of
dogged resolution overspread his lean,
muscular face.
The crowas along the street presently
became aware of the chase and began to
take an interest in it. â¢
Several joined in the pursuit.
"What has lie done?"
"What do you want of him?"
'â¢Who is he? 1 '
Paying no attention to those questions
he flew along still faster, never removing
bis eyes an instant from the object of his
pursuit.
He began to lessen the distance be
tween them.
It was evident he wns gaining-.
Straining every nerve he rapidly over
hauled the scorching rider.
'"Say!" he gasped, as he drew along
side. "How are you? You're ridine a
machine just like mine, ain't you?" Chi
cago Tribune.
The condor flies higher than any other
bird.

THE BIG FIGHT
Billy Jordan Can See But
One Man, and His Name
Is Fitz.
Al-ex Greggains Fays That the
Cornishmaa Has a Hard
Contract.
It. Is the General Belief That Fitz
simmo-xs Has Many Advantages
Gv-t the Sailor.
Betting on the Fitzsimmons and
Sharkey right has commenced in earnest.
Yesterday several hundred dollars were
wagered on the result. Fitzsimmons
is a" strong favorite, but it is thought
that the friends of Sharkey will come to
.tne front pretty strong on the day of the
.contest.
â¢ Several people interested in manly
.sports were seen yesterday, and with few
exceptions the general belief was that
Fitzsimmons would win.
James C. Nealon, the famous handball
player and all-round athlete, said that if
.Fitzsimmons i*? as clever as reports state
he should stand^ an excellent chance ot
winning the purse.
"Of course, if Fitzsimmons adopts the
same tactics as Corbett," said Nealon, "I
look for Sharkey to win, as he is capable
df standing rough treatment. Corbett
fflade a mistake in underrating Sharkey
and exchanging blow for blow. The sailor,
I think, can whip any man who will try
that game. I look to see Fitzsimmons
side-step his man and catch his game on
the return."
Billy Jordan cannot see but one man in
the tight, "toy gracious me, what possible
chance has this man SharKey against that
demon puncher," remarked Billy, as he
took an extra pull from a 60-cent cigar,
wnich he said wa3 presented to him by a
veal-butcher from Petaluma. "Why. you
should see him punch tne bag on Sunday
last. He thinks no more of smashing the
Mgeest punching-bag on eanh viith a
right-hander than I do of eating the finest
porterhouse sieak in the land. So help
me goodness if he ever lands that big
bunch of fives on Sharkey's jaw, which he
is sure 10 do and in very quick order, too,
the referee will have very uttle trouble in
deciding who is entitled to the big money
sack. Just wait and see if mv words don't
come true. I look to see Sharkey stretched
on his back before the end of the first
round or I will be th most disappointed
man on earth. I tell y^u, this fellow
Fitssltamona is a terror, and don't you
forget it. 1 like Sharkey, but I'm afraid
Tom has taken on a terrible contract this
lime. If it was any other man thun Fitz
simmons the sailor was to meet then 1
would have some doubts about the result.
This feiiow Fitzsimmons can wnip any
man on tarth."
Dan Lynch, who is manager and backer
of Sharkey, is as confident in tlie success
of his ward as a man could Le.
'"They all thins that.Fitzs.mmons has a
soft snap," said Lynch, "but they will
have good reason to mint differently after
the contest is over. Every match that
Sbark^yhas en-a^ad in was a foregone
conclusion as to result with the prophets.
"Way, Torn will not oe in it," was the. lalk
of those" wise men who have been guessing
wrong ever since Sharkey commenced
. fighting. He was looked upon as a good
chopping-Dlock :or Corbett and Choynski,
but he fooled them all, and he will fool
Fitzsimmons just as sure as you live be
-10/e they box many rounds. At the pre
vailing odds I will take considerable of
â  the money wagered on Fitzsimmons."
Alexander (iregnains said that he was
puzzled and could not venture an opinion.
"A whole lot of these fellows who pre
tend to know it all may get badly fooled
in Sharkey." remarked Greggains. "I am
aware that Fuzsimmons is a hard man to
whip, but I think he will find that
Sharkey is the hardest game he has ever
tackled. Unless Fiiz^immons can land
on the sailor's jaw, which vulnerable point
Sharkey will keep well protected, I have
my doubts of Fitz being able to knock
.out bis man. The only thing lam afraid
of is an uppercut. You see Corbett gave
Tom an awful punch in the eye, and if
Fitz can land another such blow on
Tom's chin, why it will be all over but
the shouting. Possibly Sharkey may find
a weak spot in Bob's body while the latter
is prospecting for the sailor's jaw. It's
no soft snap for Fitzsimmons by any
means."
James Markland says that it will be all
over the first good punch that Sharkey
.. gets in Â£ny part of the face.
' Phil kyan, of handball fame has an
idea that Sharkey will take his medicine
. and will be on deck fighting like an Indian
near tne end ol the tenth round.
Danny Neednam says that Sharkey will
bore holes in tlie Cornishman's stomach
large enough to stick your hst into before
three rounds are fought.
John Ferguson is of the opinion that
Sharkey will surprise the talent.
"Tnis fellow Sharkey," said Fereuson,
"is as strong as a bull, and although he
may not be a polished tighter, he has a

that he hits hard and strong enough to

Emporium Employes Dance Under the Great Dome.
FUN AND MUSIC
WERE IN PLENTY
Catholic Ladies* Aid Society
Entertainment a
Success.
Amateur Vaudeville Perform
ance Upon a Very Ex
tensive Scale.
After a Long Minstrel Olio, Which
Beat the Record f)r Encores,
Came Oth:r Features.
The amateur vaudeville performance in
the Auditorium last evening. Tinder the
management of the Catholic Ladies' Aid
Society, was a great success in every re
spect. The hou*e was filled and the en
tertainment fully justified the crowd, for
it was full of variety, good music, amusing
"gags," minstrelsy, f:mcy dancing and so
on. The funds of the Catholic Ladies'
Aid Society must have been largely in
creased. The first part was t c per
formance of the Olympic Club Society
Minstrels.
When the curtain went up there was a
small army of eayiy-clad personages ar- i
ranged in_ tiers i largely and plaTiaing u> j
bring forth tearsâ of laughter. In front j
of the stage was an orchestra under the {
direction of M. Fleishmann. The min
strelsy was under the management of G.
H. P. Taylor Jr., Alex PÂ«.osborough acting
as stage director, and Charles J. Morelas
interlocutor The, black-corked artists
were Dave Finnic, Jack Cathcart, Bobby
Mitchell, Tim Kreling, Charlie Cathcart
and Billy Hynes. The others, who mgde
up a lar^e chorus, were dressed in white,
with red trimmings, and looked very gay.
The performance was hardly under way
when "gags" concerning the airship be
gan to fiy about. The minstrelsy part
was iong and it was unanimously in
dorsed, everybody getting an encore, and
some also being lucky enough to carry off
bouquets. The singers were: A. Sugden,
W. W. Finnic, Aiex Rosborough. B. L."
Tarbox, Jack Cathcart, Frank Cnflin,
S. E. Tucker, Bob Mitchell, D. A. Finnic,
Charles Cathcart and Billy Hynes and
the Press Club quartet.
The latter aang with excellent effect,
"Sweet Pickaninny" and "We Are March
ing." The first part closed with a "drum
major" drill by J. Rand. One of the
"joshes" in the animated part referred to
the lot of the man in the airship, who
could not get a divorce "because there was
no eround."
The second part, was remarkably varied
anil enjoyable. Miss Maude Fay and the
Girls' High School Alumna 2 Glee Club
sang the "Spinning Chorus" and aria
from Wagners- Flying Dutchman," un
der the leadership of Baroness yon
Meyeiinck, accompanied by Miss Virginia
Va^sault.
Four little girlsâ Daisy Roche, Isabeile
Aliller, Nellie Sullivan and Grace Shean â
unoer the direction of the Misses Shean,
danced a Hungarian ballet; George Green
and Jack Seidemann hoxe t three rounds;
Lavater's dog orchestra from theOrpneuni
performed, and finally the farce of "Mv
Uncle's Wili" was played by Richard W.
Hoteling as Florence Marigold. Alfred
McKennon as Colonel Barker and Charles
F. Arper as Charles Cashtnnre.
The audience seemed to be as eager to
get repetitions in the second part of the
entertainment as during the first part, so
the performance was extended much be
yond the usual limit and was not over
until midnight. Take it altogether, the
performance was all right.
SURGEON GENERAL WYMAN
The Chief of the United Stateft Marine
Hospital Service Here on a Tour
of Inspection.
Dr. Walter Wyrnan of Washington,
D. C, surgeon- general of the" United
States Marine Hospital Service, was
among the arrivals here yesterday. He
came by way of the City of Mexico. He
| was a delegate irom the United Stiles to
the Pan-American Medical Association
meeting in that city. Distinguished med
ical men fn m all parts of Canada, the
United States, Central and South Ameri
ca, as well as Mexico, were present.
Since the meetin; Dr. Wyman came
leisuieJy north. He injected the Unite i
Stales Aiarine Hospital at San Diego and
then came on here. The surgeon-general
is now on his annual tour of inspection.
He will, of course, examine into t tie hos
pital service here. The doctor has not
been able to j.et here now for two years,
consequently he will ieel more like taking
an abundance of time than if he had been
able io come each year.
Considerable interest attaches to the
surgeon-general's viait. While here, for
a part of tne time at least, he will he the
guest of Dr. John M. Godfrey of the
United States Marine Hospital. It will
be remembered that some time since Sur
geon-General Wyman ordered Dr. John
Hamilton of the hospital at Chicago to
change places with Dr. Godfrey here.
Hamilton refused to change and conse
quently had to resign. It is said that Dr.
Godfrey will remain here till about March
aud will then be transferred to the East. |
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 1896.
THE LETTERS WERE
NONE OF HIS
Judge Hastings Renounced
Three Hundred Keller
Epistles.
Another Phase of the Marriage-
Claim Case Comes Up
Tc-Day.
The Claimant Says the Juige and She
Had a Son Whom She Henelf
Baptized.
Further argument in the remarkable
contest of Wary Keller, alias Mary Vio!a
â  Hastings, for some of tlie wealth of the
I late Judge S. Clinton Hastings will take
place in the Superior Court to-day. As
j tlie case goes on it promises to become
! very interesting. The firm of Delmas &
i Shuriridge is attempting to compel Mrs.
I Keller to produce lor inspection the 300
! letters they allege to be in posses-ion of
the claimant.
There were many interesting points in
the woman's testimony, taken thus far by
deposition. Among other things she
swore that Judge Hastings had one child,
I by her, a son, who died at the age of 4
j years. "We called him Joe," the said,
I "and I had to move often to keep Bob
| Hastings from stealing the child. I never
I stayed but a day or two in one boarding
house on that account."
The testimony was to the effect that the
i reputed father never saw the child but
j once, and that was for only a few minutes
; in a park in the City, though she said he
loved the child deany. She alleges that
the Judge stated that as he ha I given his
own children all they desired, he would
give her and their child the balance.
A strange point of the testimony relates
to ihe baptism of her child. She said it
was about to die one time and she baptized
it herseif iv the absence of a priest, feeling
that such a ceremony was in every way
efficacious.
The following letter from Judee Hast
ings to the lady is the only one that has
yet come to light:
San Francisco, Nov. 2, 1884.
Mrt. Mary Keller: Your letters of the 28th of
October, A. I). 1884, have been this moment
received br me, delivery having been delayed
from your sending ihem to kakeport. I sup
pose you have sent me 300 letters in the last
rive years, In wiiich you have claimed a warm
I devotion vi a personal uunchment of the most
i fulsome sort, aud which I never responded to,
! on account of my believing you to be a crank,
| or. as your frien>i JucK-e Lnku informs me, au
I adventuress. I now, for reasons no! necessary
to mention, reply to your last two and nil other
letter*. We have never promised marriage to
each other, ana further, I have never agreed
j to marry you or to do net:; publicly or pri
| vate.y which would justify any inch oonclo

POINT LOBOS AVENUE.
An Effort to Be Made to Take It From
the Park Jurisdiction.
A meeting of the Point hobos Improve
ment Club was held on Fifth avenue last
evening. The sentiment was expressed
[by E. P. Troy and other speakers that
the avenue and many of the intersecting
' streets should be improved, sidewalked
and placed ill & passable condition.
A committee of three was appointed to
wait on the Park Commissioner s and ask
I that such work be done. The committee
lis composed of E. P. Troy, P. F.lippini
and G. R. FJetcher.
In the discussion mention was made of
the pecu'iar fact that Pont Lobos avenue
is still under the jurisdiction of the Park
| Commissioners. The Legislature in 1877
i pass( d an act placing the street under the
i control of the State commission, ami
| hence it was contended that the Board of
â  Supervisors could not direct improve
ments until that law was repealed.
The sentiment of the meeting was in
favor of lecislat.ve action to repeal the old
1 law. as reasons no longer existed ior per
mitting the Park Commissioners to exer
cise jurisdiction in the premises. The
i question will be considered at a meeting
|of all the improvement clubs. On the
'evening of December 2 the Association of
; Improvement Clubs ::nd the members of
the San Francisco delegation to the Legis
lature will hold a conference.
The c!ul> appointed Messrs. Troy and
Kievres delegates to the charter conven
tion.
Mr. Defer introduced a resolution re
questing that Mayor-elect Phelan in nam
ing 100 men to frnrnp a charter should
rttQgnfse the Point Lobos Improvement
ClnlÂ». The resolution was adopted.
If the scheme of improvement for Point
Loboi avenue which many of the progres
sive memiers commend be executed, the
avenue will be bituminized and connected
with the boulevard system *o that there
will be a tine drive along Post street to
Van Ness avenue.

Barman place, off Green street, were arrested
last night by Officers llol brook and McMurray
of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children and taken to the City Prison, along
with lour of their children. Two of the elder
children escaped. The house was in a filthy
conditlon and the children were in keeping
with their surroundings. The parents were

ship of Professor John Marquardt, who

guests. Down in the restaurant and grill
rooms in the basement the tables were set
for 1000 people, a banqueting hall ouch as
has never been seen in this City.
Tne evening's enjoyment began with
speeches by President A. Fiest and Gen
eral Manager W. D. Harper of the Em
porium Company. Both gentlemen wel
comed the employes to the reception
prepared for them and trusted that the
same unity and good fellowship that
joined them together there would prevail
throughout the term of their employment
with the firm.
During the evening several entertaining
vocal selections were given by the Knicker
bocker Quartet.
At 11 o'clock the grillroom doors were
opened and the great company trooped
down Â«to the banquet, where they did
ample justice to the good things set be
fore them. Those in charge of ihe affair
were:

POWELL-STREET MARKET.
Formal Opening, Music, Decorations,
Scenes in Ice and Vast Throng
of Visitors.
Music by the Park band, fishes con
gealed in solid blocks of clear ice, a bril
liant array of electric lights, some beauti
ful decorations and a vast throng of
admiring spectators were features of the
formal opening of the new Powell-street
market last night. In preparations for
the event there was eood-natured rivalry
between the vendors of produce in that
market-place, and many of the displays
were rendered aittiactive. The market
last n ght was not open for tratfic, but the
alluring display of Thankseivine articles
will tempt buyers to-day. In, one block of
ice thrre was a fish ing- boat, to which was
attached a string of rish. The sceue
caught the notice of the little folk.
Arrested for Stealing Shoes.
Two men giving the names of George Miller
and Thomas I'inkham, and alleging that they
were miners just come to town, were arrested
yesterday afternoon' by Oflicer Frank Greenau
and booked at the Southern Police Station on
a charge of havinsr stolen a large box of sboes
from a store at s:i."i Mtirket street. The men
were apprehended in the act oi trying 10 bell
some of the sheen from the box they had se
creted vi 547 Howard street, where It had pre
viously been discovered by the agent for the
house, and reported to the police.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111, Nov. 24.â 1n total disregard of
a weak feeling at Liverpool ibe market for wheat
here was strong and higher to-day. The disposi
tion of traders was to go it alone, and reported
sales of flour at San Francisco and of cash busi
ness at this place but stimulated that Idea. There
was some apprehension of a squeeze in December,
which added to the strength displayed. Luht re
ceipts in theNortnwestâ 662 cars, against 638 last
Tuesday and 1111 a year uÂ«oâ were an argument
in favor of higher prices, feecond Liverpool cables
were even weaker than the early ones, but no
recognition was accorded them. Chicago rectlved
83 cars and inspected out 93,68 i bushels.
The Liverpool corn Tiuje .- civi was out with an

GET A FORTUNE
An Unhappy Young Wife
and Mother Hears
Good News.
Her Husband, Though in Jail,
Declares He h Worth
Much Property.
If Not Divorced From His First Wife
His Dates Shew That He Is
a Bigamist.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 24, 189b". j
The little boy of Mrs. John Lee, the
young wife who has lelt her husband be
cause he could not produce satisfactory
evidence that he had been divorced from
his first wife, will probably inherit a large
fortune. His mother, who was Miss
Minnie Diehl, has just received word lrom I
Los Angeles that her husband's name is
not Lee, but that he is the son of Antonio
Schiappa Pietra of Ventura, who died
about a year ago while on a visit to Italy,
leaving his brother apparently the heir to
ran estate estimated to be worth about
$1,000,000 to $1,250,000.
Lee declares he is the son of Schiappa
Pietra, and it was often cause for wonder,
while Lee was in Oakland, why an Italian
should have "such a name, for there is no
doubt about Lee's nationality. He is now
in j:iil in Los Angeles, charged with an
a.-sault on a young girl. In dan Francisco
he married a woman under the name of '
John Bisbee, and in this city he married j
Minnie Diehi, a 17-year-old girl, by whom â¢
he has one child, about a year old.
Lee's story as told by himself, is ns fol
lows: "I must have been about 5 or 6
years old." he said, "when my mother
married Fred Bisbee. a stage-driver run
â¢ ning from Santa Barbara to Lch Angeles.
When I was abou' 10 I was indentured to
a man named Higgins, on the Soledad
ranch, for $20 a year and clothes. A j
Spaniard named Olivas, one of my father'?
early friend*, came to the ranch one day
and recognized me and told me who 1 was.
My grandfather came later and took me to
Saticoy and later to fcjaiUa Barbara. Bisbee
finally went north and mother ana I fol
lowed him. I went to Honolulu when 18
years old and stayed there six years.
"When 1 came" back from Honolulu I
was out of funds and I worKed all round
through the Suite. Over a year ago I re
ceived a letter from a lawyer, whose name
I think is Williams. Tbis was just before
my father's aeath. He said hu was an
old friend of my iather, mother and
grandfather, and he wanted to make some
arrangements to get me my scare of the
property. My mother was then in San
Francisco. Shortly after this I saw a
notice of my father's death and heard
that the lawyers were looking for me. I
saw my mother and asked her to tell the
story of my birth, but she evaded it.
"Just after I arrived in Los Angeles,
about six months ago, Carlos Angusola,
the son of an old friend of my father in
Ventura County, met me, and I found
out through him tnat my mother had !
made a very foolish move in letting her j
rights in the estate go su long. 'I know |
a prominent iawyer,' he said, 'who has i
spent a lot of money to get you your '
riabts,' and he advised me to rk-ht the
ca"-e. About two months ago I received a
letter lrom my moiher, saying she had
BOt done exactly right by me. Sue said 1
it was a good deal her fault that 1 had ,
been kept in i.-norance of who I was. Sue i
â¢ â¢ said she had been keeping it back because I
sbe did not want to dig up the past, as it
involved several prominent and wealthy
. .. people, and for that reason had let it drop.
"Shortly alter my return from Hono
lulu I married, in 1888, in Oakland a
woman wno-e nance I do not wisli to ;<tate.
She died seven years after the marriage. |
', '1 worked in Oakland and in Aiameda ;
County and also on the steamer Harriet,
Captain Sanchez, ou the Sacramento
River."
Unless Lee was divorced from his first
wife he committed bigamy when he mar
. ried Minnie Diehl, as he married the
latter in 1894, and says his first wife died
in 1895. Friends are looking out for the
interests of the young wife and her child,
and if L?e is really old Pietra's heir, his
family here will certainly pet a share. At
present they live with Mrs. Lee's mother,
â¢ and they are not any too well blessed ffith
this world's goods.
WILL HELP THE BOY.
Judge Yule hecks to Save Oscar Ball
lieimer From the Koform School.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 24.â There was j
an unusual scene witnessed in Judge !
. , Ogden's court tnis afternoon when "Oscar j
Ballbeimer, whose father is desirous of
haling him put in the Whittier Reform j
(school, was being tried. Balllieimer is an j
exceptionally bright boy of 16 years of age, |
but O. C. Baliheimer, his father, alleges j
in his petition that Oscar is an incorrigible
youth who runs away from home and is
beyond the control of his parents. The 'â 
petition also states that at one time Oscar j
.Â«tole irom a man named Dole the sum of i
Â° . 30 cents.
When the case was called the father j
testified to the allegations in the petition. !
Oscar was finally placed on the stand. He j
said his mother bad died some years a_'<>
. . and that his father shortly remarried. He
said his stepmother was not kind to him,
and that he faced the winter and slept un
" der the trees, where he got more comlort
' than he fid at home.
Judge Ogden asked the boy if he would
not like to go to the Reform School and
learn a trade. The boy looked down at
the floor and wiped the tears from his
eyes. Hesitatingly he replied, "Well,
Judge, I will go there for th. sake of my
father, and be a good boy, too. Maybe
some day he will love me again as he
used to."
Judge Yule, vbo happened to be pres
ent, interceded in behalf of the boy. He
requested that the case go over for a week
and he would use every effort in his power
to get a position for him and prevent a
b:ot on bis character that would follow
him through life. The case was con
tinued.

MISS RILEY'S PRIZE,
Won in Another Woman's Brest who
Now Wants the Watch and
Threatens Suit.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 24.â A lawsuit
over a gold watch offered as a prize at a
masquerade ball Saturday night is among
the possibilities of the near future if the
word of AJrs. George Dillingham is to be
taken.
It was offered as the first prize to the
best dressed lady at the ball. Many were
the aspirants for this honor and among
them was Mrs. Dillint:ham. She prepared
a handsome short white skirt and a pink
bodice, bui a day or two before the event
she was taken ill and had to give up the
idea of going.
ThÂ«>n she said the dress must go. It was
too pretty to lie idle, so she began to look
around for some one to wear it. A young
man who lived at Diilin*;ham's took in
the situation and asked that his girl might
have it to wear. "Why, yes," assented
the good woman, "if she will give' me
any prize it may capture." He agreed to
this bargain and on Saturday evening
brought in Miss Minnie Riley of Golden
Gate, who donned the dress. "Ii I win a
prize I'll divide with you, Mrs. Dilling
ham," said Mss Riley.
"You'll do nothing of the sort," ex
claimed the owner of the dress. "The
prize will be mine. I won't charge you
anything for wearing the gown, but if you
win a prize it comes to me.*'
Miss Riley acquiesced and went off hap
pily. She secured first pr:ze and was
given the watch. After taking his girl
home the young man returned to his
lodgings and told Mrs. Dillingham how
her dress captured the first prize, and
offered her $5 for the watch. This offer
was spurned and a row ensued. Miss
Riiey aid not return the dress the next
day, nor turn over the watch. Yesterday
Mrs. Di ! linuham visited Miss Riiey's
home in Golden Gate and demanded both,
but got neither. Now, sue says, she will
sue.

MAKING THE CLYDE.
It Took Ten Wars and Cost the City

"Glasgow made the Ci yde and the Clyde

been aroused among the inhabitants of the
budding city, and it was not long before
they perceived that if the community were
ever to rise lo eminence in that direction
the city must become a port open to the
commerce of the world. The task was one
lof herculean dimensions, but they set
tnemseives to it with a determination of

any decree of difficulty.

Adventure With Mciiian Brigands.
â¢The Giornale di Sicilia of Palermo gives
the following particulars of the recent
[ capture by brigands, and subsequent es
cape, of Canon Antonio Compagno, a rich
laud-owner of Prizzi. It appears that the
canon was waylaid one Sunday evening
by five armed ruffians in the public street
and was carried by them the next day to
Bisacquino, where he was lodged in a hay
loft, and well guarded nig ,t and day. He
was well treated by his captors, and re
galed with roast and boiled meat and
wine, and slept upon a bed. One day
having written a letter to his family at
the dictation of the chief of the brigands'
demanding a sum of ?8000 (40,000 fire) as
ransom, he called to the brigand acting as
sentry, with the intention of giving nira
the letter, and not receiving any reply
opened the door ot the loft, and found the
brigand was asleep. Taking up a gun
: which .he , found against the wall, the
canon shot the brigand; through the head
and succeeded in making his escape. 'â¢ The

MEASURING AN ODOR.
Science Shows Us the Way to Identify
Smells Unerringly.
Nothing is more subtle, more evanes
cent, than odor, and one would think tha
if ever there were a domain likely to re
main forever free from scientific measure
ment, it would be that of scent.
But now comes M. Eugene Mesnard, a
French botanist, and proceeds to unlock
the main gate of the fastness that
had seemed impregnable. He has
discovered a simple and easy method
of measuring the intensity of an
odor, says the New York Journal. Modern
authorities hold that the prpftr ss of a
science is rapid in proportion to the ease
with which measurements may be per
formed In it. Electricity made "almost no
progress at all till exact "methods of meas
uring charges and currents and the forces
of electric attraction and repulsion were
devised, and when these were perfected ft
went ahead almost at a bound. Who can
tell what the science of odors will or will
not do. now that the prime essential to its
progress has been di-covered?
We ure already able by the sense of
smell to distinguish very exactly between
different kinds of scents â every man, with
out special practice, can doubtless recog
nize hundreds of substances with the aid
of the nose alone. We can tell whether
one whiff of ammonia is more or less pow
erful than another, but we cannot assign a
number to each. The more i-owerful one
might be twice or thrice or a hundred
times as powerful as the other for all we
can teil.
And who, to go further still, would ven
ture to assign the exact strength oi a whiff
of ammonia that should be equal to an
entirely different odor â say the perfume of
arose? Yet all this, and more, M. Mes
nard has done.
He takes advantage of the delicate qual
itative power of the sense of smellâ that
is, of its ability to discriminate between
odors, be they different only by a very
little. He finds that if" some very char
acteristic odor be minnled with the one to
be measured there is a certain proportion
of the two where they balance, as it were,
and form what he cnlls a "neutral odor."
In this state the addition of a very little
more of either scent causes that one to
predominate. When they are thus bal
anced the intensities of the two odors are
equal, and by properly cnoosing a stan
dard odor we can thus compare all others
with it, and, hence, indirectly, with each
other.
This is the way M. Mesnard goes to
AN EVANGELIST FROM KENTUCKY.
OAKLAND, Cal., Not. 24.â N0 mission conducted in East Oakland has met â Uh
more success or aronsed greater interest than that of Rev. Dr. H. C. Morrison of
Kentucky, editor of the Methodist. Dr. Morrison has exceeded tne time it was
originally intended he should stay at the Eighth-avenue Methodist Church, but the
concregation still refuse to let him depart. Christians of all denominations have
nocked to hear him, and his.-ork has produced remarkable results.
work to make his measurement. The per
unie whose intensi ( y is to be measured ,or
the object that gives it off, say a bunch of
violets, is confined under a bell-vjlass.
The odor of turpentine is pumped in by
squeezing a rubber bulb till the "neutral
odor" Is obtained, the experimenter
"keeping waich." as it were, by smelling
at a connecting tube. Then the mixed
scents are admitted, a little bit at a time,
into a jar containing glowing phosphorus.
The amount admitted is reeistered by
the turns of a handle, and the number
of turns necessary to put out the phos
phorus gives the measure of the quan
tity of turpentine and hence of the in
tensity of the odor that was neutralized
by it.
We may expect, if such measurements
as this are to be carried out very fre
quently, a great increase of delicacy in
smell among those who perform them. At
present this sense has been much neg
lected. The processes of evolution bave
passed it by on one aide of the human
species, although in others â the dog, for
instance â it has been marvelously de
veloped. But as certain modern authori
ties have pointed out. man has to a great
extent taken his evolution into his own
bands.
Perhaps M. Mesnard is giving us a little
shove toward an almost dog-like perfec
tion of scent!
WHISTLED FOR A HUSBAND.
But She Did It Wholly Unawares, and
They Lived HÂ»ppily Ever Afterward.
"Talking about whistling," said the
man who was spinning a yarn in the
smoker, "reminds me of a curious inci
dent that happened to me in a hotel once
â not exactly a tragedy or a comedy, but
involving features of both. It was in a
country town hotel, and I went to my
room early to escape the dullness of the
office and write letters to the house. There
was gas in the room, but after searching I
could not discover any matches and there
was no bell to ring for them. I decided to
waylay some attendant in the hall,
and sat down to my writinsr. But
no sooner was everything still than
I heard some one whistling in the
next room. First it was a snatch from
an opera, then a ten ier and musical ren
dition of 'Annie Laurie.' I could not
write a line for the witchery of the whis
tled numbers. Once I applauded, but
there was a long silence and I did not re
peat the indiscretion. It was evidently
some young fellow who whistled uncon
sciously, and when he was reminded of it
ceased to pipe his sweet music.
"When he stopped whistling I resumed
my pen and wrote my letters. Then 1
thought of the matches and rapped on
my neighbor's door.
" "1 say, younir fellow, oblige rae with a
match, will you?'
"There was no response, but I could
hear a movement and a kind of chuckle.
I became interested and rapped again.
" 'Say, there, don't be a dog in the man
ger. Anybody who can whistle as sweetly
as you ought tv> be obliging.'
"With that the door opened and there
stood before me a demure but very pretty
young woman, who handed me a solitary
match and shut the door and locked it
so quickly that I could not even say
'thank you,' even if I had not been
stricken dumb with surprise."
"tone was the whistler? '
"She was."
"A"d did you meet her again?"
"Well, rather. I had a great bie apology
to make the next day and I made itâ and,
well she is my wife now and I owe my
happiness to the fact that she whistles." â

THE WORK OF BILTMORE.
What Is liefng Done on George Van-
derbilt'B Great Kstato.
Biltmore, the magnificent estate of
George Vanderbttt, at Asheville, N. C, is
not, as many persons have supposed,
merely a rich man's lad. On the contrary,
its 95,000 acres are intended to show what
cultivation may do. Mr. Morton, the Sec
retary of Agriculture, recently spent a
week at Biltraore.
On his return to Washington the Secre
tary told his colleague* that he had seen
the most perfect system of roadways; an
exhibition also of landscape gardening
that cannot be paralleled; and buildings
which, for fitness as dwellings, stables,
barns, dairies, propagating-houses, hen
| neries and other uses, surpass any within
| his knowledge.
"I consider Mr. Vanderbilt's work
tuere," said the Secretary , "just as impor
| tant to the agricultural" interests of this
country as the Department of Agriculture
â at Washington. He employs more men
than I have under my charge, and I think
he is spending more money every year
than Congress appropriates for this de
partment. His men are promoted for
j efficiency according to the most practical
j civil service rules.
"Mr. Vanderbilt is building up an edu
cational institution that will be of the
greatest value to scientific farmers and
! teachers for the instruction of others in
i domestic architecture, in agriculture, for-
I estry, viticulture, dairying, road-making,
and other useful sciences.
"It it one of the grandest undertakings
that individual enterprise ever attempted,
and I understand that it is the owner's in
tention to leave it as a legacy to the pub
lic.
"The people down there talk about the
enormous amount of money that Mr.
Vanaeruilt is spending to gratify nis pride
and appetite. They do not comprehend
the first letter in the alphabet of his am
bition. While they imagine that it is all
due to .selfishness, he is working for
them." â Youth's Companion.

"I shall not allow them to do it any
more than I did last time." The old
lady's reference was to a former adventure
ot Superintendent of Streets Chick, who
was induced to desist from moving the
house at the point of a revolver held by
M.s. Townsend.
"I claim tne ground my house is on is
private property," the woman continued,
"and I shall defend it; and any one who
attempts to move the house will find it a
dangerous business."
"We are going to move the house off the
street," said Guy H. Chick, Suparinten
dent oj Streets. "It is very niuen in the
way and is an obstruction that must be
got rid of."
Mr. Chick was told of Mrs. Townsend'u
vigil and her intention to shoot any
iiousemover that comes within range.
"I guess we'll find some way of moving
tho house," he said.
To morrow morning, Mr. Chick says,
the house will be moved. Just what plan
will be followed to avoid trouble with the
occupant remains to be seen.

WATERLOO.
The Final Charged in the Momentous
Battle.
Before the combined armies of Welling
ton and Blucher the French could not
stand, but, in spite of inferior numbers,
and the manifest signs of defeat, General
Bonaparte might have conducted an
orderly retreat. The case was different
with Napoleon, the Emperor, even though
he was now a Liberator; to retreat would
have been merely a postponement of the
day of reckoning. Against this army
Napoleon dispatched what was left of
that force which was the peculiar product
of his life and genius, the old and middle
guard. Most of its members were the
children of i easant.s, and had been born
in ante- Revolution days. Neither intelli

ing, they nevertheless had the look of per
fect fighting-machines.
Their huge bearskin caps and lonu mus
taches did not diminish the fierceness of
their aspect. They had been selected for
Bize, docility and strength; they had been
well paid, well fed and well drilled ; they
had, therefore, no ties but those to their
Emperor, no homes but their barracks,
and- no enthusiasm but their passion for
imperial France. They would have fol
lowed no leader unless he were distin
guished in their system of life; accord
ingly, Ney was selected for that honor,
and, as they came in proud confidence up
the Charleroi road, thnir Emperor passed
them in review. Like every other divi
sion, they had been told that the distant
roar was from Grouchy 's guns; when in
formed that all was ready for the finish
ing stroke, that there was to be a general
advance along ihe whole line, and that no
man was to be denied his share in certain
victory, even the sick, it is said, rose up
and hurried anto the ranks. The air
seemed rent with their hoarse cheers as
their columns swung in measured tread
diagonally across the northern spur of the
cross-line elevation which cut; the surface
of the valley.
Wellington, informed of the French
movement, it is thought, by a deserter,
issued hurried orders to the center, or
dered Maitland's brigade to where the
charge must be met, and posted himself,
with Napier's battery, somewhat to its
right. While yet hia words of warning
were scarcely uttered the head of the
.French column appeared. The Englisti
! batteries belched "forth a welcome, but
although Ney's horse, the fifth that day,
was shot, the men he led suffered little,
I and. with him on foot at their side, they
j came steadily onward. The British
guards wÂ«re lying behind the hill-crest
and the Frencu could discern no foe â only
a few mounted officers, of v:hom Welling
ton was one. Astonished and incredu
lous, the assailants pressed steadily on
until within twenty yards of the English
line. "Up, guards! make ready!" rang
out the DuKes well-known call.
The hritish jumped and fired. About
300 of Ney's gallant soldiers fell; but there
was no confusion. On both sides volley
succeeded voiley, and this lasted until the
British charged. Then, and then oniy,
the French withdrew. Simultaneously
Donzelot had fallen upon Alten'sdivision;
but he was leading a forlorn hope and
making no impression. As Ney fell back
a body of French cuirassiers advanced
upon the English batteries. Their success
! was partial, and behind them a second
I column of the guard was formed. Again
j the assault was renewed, nut the second
I attempt fared worse than the first. To the
right of Maitland. Adam's brigade, with
the Fifty-second Regiment, r.ad taken a
stand. Wheeling now these poured a
deadly flunk fire into the advancing
I French, while the others poured in a de
i vastating hail of bullets from the front.
The front ranks of the Fiench replied
with spirit, but when the British had
I completed their maneuver Colborne gave
I the order, his men cueered in response,
and the countercharge began. "Vive
i'Empereur !" came the responsive cheer
from the thinning ranks of the assailants,
and still they came on. But in the awful
crash they reeled, confusion followed, and
almost In the twinkling of an eye the rout
began. The bat alions of the old guard
j under Cambronne, retreated in fair order
to the center of the valley, where they
made their last gallant ?tand against the
overwhelming numbers of Halkett's Ger
man brigade. They fought until but 150
survived. From all sides the despairing
cry ol "Sauve gui peut!" rang in their
ears. To the final summons of surrender
the leader assented, and they filed in de
jection to the rear. Tnis occurrence has
passed into tradition as an epic event;
what Cambronne might well have said,
"The guard dies, but never surrenders,"
was not uttered, but it epitomizes their
character and in the phrase they and their
leader have found immortality. â William
M. Sloane in the Century.
BACKWOODS SURGERY.
A Steam Engine and a Pulley Used In
Reducing a Dislocation?
"Probably as queer a piece of backwoods
surgery as has ever been described," says
a frequenter of the region, "was that per
formed by a Moosehead Late -guide known
as 'Old Sabattus,' twenty years ago.
The man was not an Indian, as tne nick
name implies, but a YanKee, one of those
rough fellows formerly characteristic of
that locality. This guide was left on a
lake steamboat at one of the far-up land
ings while the engineer went ashore with
the company. A man named Meservev
came aboard, and in fooling around the
boat he managed to turn Die down into
the fire pit und put hia shoulder out of
pint.
"Here was a dilemma. The other mem
bers of the party would not be bacK for
half an hour and the injured man was in
erreat pain. The guide was a man of ex
pedients. He got a rope and tied his pa
tient securely to a post. Then he tied an
other rope around the man's wrist and
hitcned the loose end of it to the pulley of
the engine. He managed somehow to
turn on steam and the pulley began to
wind up the rope, it drew the arm out
tight in beautiful shape and presently the
joint snapped back into its socket. Then
'Sabattus' jumped around to shut off
steam, while the pully kept on winding.
'Holy Mcse3,' gasped the guide, excitedly,
'how does it go? I don't know where it

the pully meanwhile was slowly but
surely pulling Meservey to pieces. His
eyes were sticking out of their sockets and
he screamed and Rasped for breath.
"Sabattus danced around like a wild man,
not knowing what to do, when he hap
pened to spy a hatchet lying near, and,
jumping for that, he cm the rope and
*aved a dreadful catastrophe. This was
done just aa the party of city folks who
had gone ashore came rushing back on to
the boat alarmed by Meservey'" screams.
It was some years afterwards," says the
narrator, "that I vfaÂ« present when a lot
of summer company arrived at Greenville.
Sabattus was there, too, and presently a
distinguished looking man, one of the
newcomers, went up to him and said with
a meaning smile, 'Ate you the man that
practices surgery by steam?' Sabattus
had to admit that he was 'that same fel
ler.' "â Lewiston (M(>.) Journal.

The rainfall left tbe track In bad condi
tion at Oakland, and the wonder is that
three favorites managed to get through
and land the coin.
At the turn into the stretch several
yards of track was washed away and the
jockeys say some good navigating was
necessary to steer clear of holes. In con
sequence tbe good horses remained in the
stable and the "skates" furnished the
betting proposition.
ThÂ« weather turned off cold and the
crowd kept moving about, muffed up in
overcoats to keep them warm, although in
6unny Oakland. The betting was good
and the ring no doubt quit loser to the
day's booking.
Tbe opening race looked a Cakewalk for
Mount Koy, the 9 to 10 favorite, and such
he proved, for he won away off from Don
Fio Pico with Shaw perched up on his
neck. Agitato finished in tlie show.
Charley Thorpe was success'.ul on the
occasion of his debut before a California
rnce-goingr crowd. He had the mount on
the hot favorite Salisbury II in the race
following, a five and a half furlong selling
dash, and the Racine colt won quite as
easily as Mount Roy in the event preced
ing. Candor was a handy second over
Charles A.
Four started in the seven furlong purje
event, which was looked upon as a <Â«ort of
good thing for the Rose entry Torsina.
Tne mare was heavily backed at evens,
with 6ir Play and Moylan fauqied in thai
order. ThornhiJl was the outsider. Jones
on Sir Play made all the running, and
when the favorite sent in her challenge
through the stretch could not quite get
up, ana succumbed by a iiead in 1:32.
Moylan, who could not un track himself,
finished lengths behind Thornhill.
The mile selling ran with a field of ten
starters was a very pretty race. Joe Terry
and Heriiianita went to the post equal
favorites in the batting. Passing in turn
Flashlight, Little Cripple and Excuse,
Jones, astride Joe Terry, showed slightly
in tbe lead as the stretch was reached.
While battling hard with Excuse Murphy
brought Little Cripple up on the outside,
and passing Joe Terry, beat him out a
head. Excuse was third, but a nose be
hind the place horse. Hermamta was
messed about, finishing fifth.
Old Braw Scot had another celebration
in the concluding nice of the day at six
lurlongs. Going to the post a slight
favorite over Peril, H. Martin beat the
gate with the veteran, and, after being
passed by both Peril and Lucky Dog, he
again took the lea.l in the stretch and
proved a handy winner. Seaside looked
to have b.-aten Lucky Dog a neck for the
place, but was placed third.

THORNTON'S SCORCHING REVIEW
OF JUDGE HEBBARD'S COURSE
Vigorously Denies in His Opening Statement That
the Complaining Jurist Was
Libeled.
Williams Will Plead Justifica
tion for His Now Famous
Circular.
TO CITE THE BANK'S BOOKS.
James Alva Watt and John F. Sheehan
Also Brought Into the
Discussion.
The ca?e of Thomas S. Williams Jr.,
under indictment for libeling Judge Heb- j
bard oi the Superior Court, was on hear
ing before a jury in Judge Daingerfield's
court yesterday. The ever present circu
lar issued by Williams and other deposit
ors in the People's Home Savings Bank
was read and reread to the jury until it is
believed that the majority of them must
have committed it to memory, and a few
of them ought to bo able to repeat it from
beginning to end, even in their sleep.
The apparent intention of the defense
to dispute due proof of Jthe publication of
the circular, which the defendant's attor- j
ney admitted to bs in part probably libel- I
ous if not true, was abandoned yesterday,
and Attorney Crittenden Thornton, in
his opening statement for tbe defendant,
said he would attempt to prove justifica
tion. He said that the defense would
prove as was never proved before the alle
gations in the circular, that would, go to
show that Judge Hebbard was actually
an unfair man, and was unfit to hold the
position of Judge; that the defense would
prove that by his manner of giving out
" judicial patronage to John F. Sheehan
and James Alva Watt, the prosecuting
witness here, Judge Hebbard, had shown
himself to be unfair and an unfit person
to aspire to such an oliice as he was seek- â¢
ing when the circular was issued.
Attorney Thornton read to the jury the
opening paragrapn of the circular wherein !
it was alleged that "a sensational paper
had misrepresented the facts," and as- â 
sured the jurors that this allegation was j
not material, whether true or not, as it re
lated to a third party. Having thus dis
posed of the Examiner as an immaterial
matter, the attorney proceeded.
Going on down the column of printed '
matter Mr. Thornton read the statement j
that Judge Hebbard had promised to allow j
the board of directors of the People's Home \
Savings Bank to meet for the purpose !
of resigning, but that on the day follow
ing be changed his mind and refused to
. Jot tuem meet for any purpose whatever.
This. Mr. Thornton said, was because
James Aiva Wait, who with John }
F. Sheehan was the recipient of Judge j
Hebbara's patronage, opposed tbe ap- ;
Vointment or recognition of any board of '
directors that would not emplnv him as j
tlieir attorney. He said thai Watt, who
in the circular was described as "notori- i
ous," hud such influence with Judge Hei> !
bard that he and John F. Sheehan were
sure of all the patronage in Judge Heb
bard's court.
In justification of the term "parasite," |
as applied to Jonn F. Sheehan, Mr. Thorn
ton fuia that iv five years Sheehan has
not earned a dollar outside of what he re- i
ceived in consequence of appointments :
made by Judge Hebbard. and that during j
that period Sheehan has been paid net less ;
than $20,000 on account of fees and emolu- j
ments unaer such appointments. This I
sum, he said, was almost equal to the '
salary received by Judge Hebbard him
self as a member of the Superior Court of
tbe City and County of San Francisco.
When Mr. Thornion was about to quote i
from Webster's Dictionary to prove that a j
parasite is one who dines with another, or
who is supported by another, and that
significance has been twisted, Attorney
W. W. Foote objected to argument by
counsel before the testimony was in.
District Attorney Barnes and Attorney
Barclay Henley mixed up in tbe dis
cussion, but Mr. Thornton held his
ground, and finally Judge Daingerfield
permitted him to proceed in his own way
in presenting his views to the jury as to
the facts that were essential to prove in
order to establish justification of issuing
the circular.
Continuing his statement of facts that
were to be proved Mr. Thornton said that
when Judge Hebbard was the presiding
Judge of the Superior Court he allotted to
himself all the cases pertaining to the
Home Savings Bank, and invariably ap
pointed Sheehan to some position if there
was an opportunity to do so, even after
tbe Supreme Court had decided that he
had no right to do so; that Sheehan was
three times so appointed.
After the Supreme Court had knocked
out Sheehan as receiver of the People's
Home Savings Bank, Mr. Thornton said,
James Alva Watt manipulated the stock
in such a way that Sheehan was appoint
ed secretary and manager of the bank and
Watt was appointed his attorney. The
securing of the majority of the stock was
Decessary to prevent the attempt to shake
off the grip which Sheehan and Watt
had on the millions of the bank.
In the Goldtree casts against the bank,
Mr. Thornton said, whicn was brought by
tbe procurement of these same men, the
attorney who filed the suit never met his
client, and knew nothing of tho matter at
the time. In that case Sheehan had been
appointed as receiver and W'jut as attor
ney, as usual, so that fimsliy Watt was at
torney for tbe receiver and in three sepa
rate casps, and was also attorney for ihe
bank. Thus Sheehan, who was receiver
in three suits against the bank, was at the
fame time manager of the bank, and
Watt was his attorney in all the cases,
feheehan. who occupied two antagonistic
positions, was backed up by Watt, his at
torney, who also occupied two antagonis
tic positions.
in regard to the allegation in the circu
lar that the receiver had been discharged
by Judge Hebbard without a proper ac
counting. Mr. Thornton said it would be
shown that no accounting whatever had
been made then or since, and no docu
ment is on hie which pretends to be
an accounting of the millions that
came into the hands of these men. The
only attempt at an accounting, he said,
was when James Alva Watt and his
brother, Kolla V. Watt, a member of the
board of airedorsof the People's Home
Savings Bank, appearad in court and said
they were satisfied with Sheehan's man
agement of the bank's affairs. This how
ever, was not a lawful accounting, and the
circular had stated tha strict truth in say
ing that no proper accounting had been
demanded of Sheelian as receiver befora
he was discharged. The records of the
bank would be appealed to in order to
prove that Watt and Sheeh.-.n drew $500 a
month from the defunct bunk.
Having thus ciearly stated what he ex
pected to prove, Mr. Thornton said the de
fense would not muke an appeal to mercy,
but would establish as facts all the allega
tions of the circular in justification of the
charge that Judge Hebbard was unfair
and unfit to occupy a seat on the Superior
Court bench.
Attorney Footo asked the clerk of the
court to note an exception to the Judge's
1 rnlinK which admitted the "statement
I and argument" just ended by Mr. Thorn
! ton.
Attorney Henley, representing the de
fendant, announced that the first thinn to
be presented to prove justification of the
charges apainst Judge Hebbard iraa the
record in tho case of Knight et al. ayainst
the People's Home Savings Bank, which
| suit was instituted by tbe Attorney-Gen-
I eral of the Mate of California and was
I tried in Judge Hobbard's conrt.
Just as Mr. Henley had pitched his voice
â to the key so essential lor the effective
! reading of legal documents and had pro-
I ceeded as far as the title of the court and
â¢ cause, he was interrupted by Mr. Foote
I and District Attorney Barnes, both of
I whom were in.-tantiy on their ieet to in
: terpose objections.
Mr. Fooie was the first to speak. He
j said that it would be altogether irregular
i and erroneous to admit the records of all
I the People's Home Savings Bank cases,
| be a use nothing could be proved thereby
except that JndÂ«e Hebbanl had ap
pointed John F. Sheehan to certain posi
tions and that Sheehun had cmploveu
James Alva Watt as his attorney. Now
the mere appointment of Sheehan and
Watt to such portions did not imply
moral turpitude on the part of Jud.e
Hebbard, as was charged in the circular,
unless it could be proved that Judue
Hebbard had a guilty knowledge of the
alleged fact that Sheehan was incom
petent to act as the manager oi the bank's
affairs, that he was a "parasite," etc., aud
that Watt was "notorious." etc., and not
a proper person to act as Sheehaus at
torney.
He would assume in advance, Mr. Foote
added, that the attorneys for the deiense
would promise to connect the evidence
now offered, with Judge Hebbard's knowl
edge of Sheehan and Watt, later in the
trial, or mey would consent to have it ail
stricken out. This was the method some
attorneys pursue in trying such a case as
this; but Mr Foote was convinced that it
was not ttie proper course. He thought
that the proof of Judge Hebbard's knowl
edge of Sheehan's unworthiness, if proof
of such knowledge exists, ought to be pro
duced first. Then if the records in the
bank cases ap; ear relevant they may be
Considered by the court and the jury.
District Attorney Barnes re-en forced
! Mr. Foote's argument with the usual
' statutory objection that the records in the
I bank cases are immaterial and incom
â  pefnt, because they do not tend to prove
| or disprove any of the issues of the cause
I on trial.
Mr. Thornton responded by making the
very offer that Mr. Foote said he would â
namely, that he would consent to have
the testimony adduced from the records
: in the bank cases stricken from the pres
ent rrial if he and his associates failed to
I prove Judge Hebbard's knowledge of
i Sheehau's acts and of his incompetency to
manage the affairs of the great institution
; which had been intrusted to him by Judge
i Hebbard's official acts and solely by sane
; tion of Judge Hebbard's judicial order.
Judge Daingertield looked up at the
! ceiling, as is his wont when about to rule
| on some knotty point, and remarked that
; he was not disposed to dictute to attorneys
- us to the order in which they presented
J the proofs thatrthey deem material to their
' case.
Before he could complete his ruling
j Judge Hebbard reached over and held a
' whispered consultation with Mr. Foote,
i who thereupon announced that at the re
, quest of his client, the complaining wit
ness, he would withdraw all objection
ito the introduction ot the records of
the bank cases. He said that Judge
Hebbard courted the widest and most
| thorough scrutiny of bis acts, and was
; willing to have all the records that were
deemed material in the slightest degree
j brought here for examination and analy-
I sis. Mr. Foote, however, reserved his
j right to move to strike ont the records and
all the evidence adduced from them un
less the attorneys on the other side were
able to connect Judge Hebbard with a
guilty knowledge of any unworthiness of
i Sheeh&n and Watt at the time of their
i appointment.
Mr. Henley again adjusted his spectacles
' and at cuce piungea into the reacting of
â  the voluminous complaints, demurrers,
j cross-complaints, writs of oertiorari. no
j tices of appeal, certificates of appointment
oi receivers, etc., ur.til the iury D came
impatient, and an adjournment was taken
until this morning, when the same thing
. will be kept up lor another session. By
I to-morrow the taking of oral testimony
! will be commenced.
R. H. McDonald Jr. is to be a witness in
j the case, and the odd thing is that both
sides are said to have subpenaed him.
REEL TERRY'S PIST.
It Swung Dangerously Xi-ar Mr. Hey
neman'ft Nose, but Didn't Land. â 
Attorney Reel B. Terry struck at Attor
ney A. Heyneman in Judge Sanderson's
court yesterday morning, and for a mo
ment it looked as ;if a serious difficulty
.would ensue, but it passed off without
hurtful consequences.
' At the time of the renconter the douo
sition of Mrs. Zalisliy was being taken be
fore Court Commissioner Tyler, who sat
near Judge Sanderson.
. Attorney Tyler had several times asked

band, and whose husband in the present
case is suing V one . George Newman ' for

The questions touched upon the friendly
relations whic:i Mr. Heyneman assumed

vorced wife, Mr. Heyneman attempting to
prove that they, have joined forces lor the
time being in order to get some money out
of Newman. 1 .
i Mr. Terry objected to the questions, and
his objections were several times sus

MISS MAXINE ELLIOTT, Who Was Divorced Yesterday.
[From a photograph by Thort.]
FREEDOM FOR THE
FAIR MAXINE
Miss Elliott Secures a
Divorce From Gaorge
McDermott.
Cruelty and Failure to Support
Proved in Judge Sander
son's Court.
Eecoming Attire cf the Fair Young
Divorcee en the Auspicious
Occasion-
â¢'My husband abused me terribly, he
really did, your Honor," sobbed pretty
Miss Maxine Elliott in Judge Sanderson's
court yesterday.
The clock in the darkened corridor of
the new City Hall was just upon the
stroke of noon as this moving scene in the
clos9 of a domestic drama was taking
place.
Miss Elliott was trying to get rid of a
husband who, she declared, was unworthy
of the wealth of af'ection that she had
showered upon him. In private life, she
explained, her name is Mrs. Jessie C. Mc-
Dermott, and the name of her recreant
ex-spouse is George A. McDermott.
Judge Sanderson begged the lady to
compose herself, and with an effort such
as a heroine is supposed to make when
preparing for some dread ordeal, Mrs.
McDermott resumed control of the foun
tain of tears, and the trial proceeded. She
was attired in a fetching gown of dark
blue, with a light colored jacket cut in the
latest style, and wore a big hat with
wide-swaying plumes that nodded grace
fully as the fair plaintiff bent forward to
pour her tale of woe iiito the ear of Judge
Sanderson.
After telling of her marriage with the
delendr.n?. and referring gently to the
first blissful years of her wedded life, Mrs.
McDermott related the circumstances
which led to her separation from her hus
band. She said that h - neglected his
business for the race course, and though
he was an attorney With a fair income at
tbe time oi their marriage, he soon began
to display a desire to live without work
ing, and failed to support her. Disagree
ment followed and he oiten abused her,
using very harsh language almost con
stantly, a.id sometimes ne struck her.
In 1891 Mrs. McDermott left her hus
band ant came to this City to reside with
her father who is a captain,
and soon after began her career as an
actress, in which she has been so success
ful that she is independent of tbe assist
ance of her husband. She said she
thought she could continue to support
herself if granted a divorce, and wouid
not make any demand for alimony.
"Have you ever made any rffort to se
cure a reconciliation?" asked Judae San
derson.
"I have written to him," replied the
lady, somewhat evasively.
"Did you receive any reply?" continued
the court.
"I have not."
The court, appeared satisfied, and Miss
Gertrude Elliott, sister of the plaintiff and
also an actress, was introduced us a wit
ness. Miss Gertrude corroborated the tes
timony of Mrs. McDermott In regard to
her residence in this State.
Miss Isabelie Hastins, actress, was next
called. Her appearance attracted the at
tention of those present in court even
more than did the principal participator
in the piece at that instant on the boards,
for it was conceded on all sides that Miss
Haskins was the handsomest young
woman who had been in the new City
Hail for many a long day.
Miss Haskins' testimony was very brief.
She knew Mr. and Mrs. MoDermott in
New York City and knew that they had a
great deal of i rouble. After one of their
quarrels she saw thnt Mrs. McDerruott's
arm was bruise! and discolored by a
clow.
"Let a decree of divorce be granted,"
said Judge Sanderson, and Mrs. McDer
niott, known to the world of theater
lovers as Maxine Elliott, .Â«wert from the
room free from the shackles of matri
mony.
A LOVESICK LABORER.
William Slightmait -wallows a Dole of
Muriatic Acid.
William Blightman, 807 Kearny street,
until a month ago worked on a ranch in
Stanislaus County. Ho came to the City
and fell in love with Lola Smith, a waitress
in a saloon at 636 Sacramento street.
A few daya ago he took a trip to the
country in search of work am! returned
Monday. He called upon Lola yesterduy
afternoon ami was received witJi coldness.
Hp tried to set her Jo resume their former
relations, and when she declined lie went
to the sidewalk and swallowed a dose of
muriatic acid. He was sent to the Re
ceiving Hospital in the patrol wagon,
where the usual remedies were adminis
tered and he was soon pronounced out of
danger.

CORPUS DELICTI.
â 
John, Collins' Attorney Sam It Has
Not Been Proved and Asks for
a IHfichurce.
The trial of John Collins, charÃed with
the murder of Margaret Crowley, began in
Judge Wallace's court yesterday.
Kitty Crowley. John Crowley, Edward
F. Ward and 1 Timothy Crowley testified
that Col lins kicked the woman and broke
her thigh. Subsequently she died, and
Collins was charged with murder. They
could not swear when Collins kicked the
woman.
Dr. E. A. Knoit and Dr. J. S. Barrett
testified that Mrs. Crowley died of peri
tonitis. Dr. Barrett said that if the woman
had been kicked in the abdomen her death
might have resulted from such an injury,
as it might have superinduced the peri
tonitis which carried her off. He was
confident that a kick on the thigh would
not have superinduced an attack of peri
tonitis.
Collins' attorney contended that it hail
not been shown that Mrs. Crowley died
from the effect of the kick administered
by Collins 1 , and as the corpus delicti had
not besn proved he moved the court to in
struct th* jury to acquit the defendant.
Judge Wallace said he was not willing
âºto take, such action without hearing fur
ther testimony, and so the case was con
tinned until this morning for the purpose
of recalling Dr. Barrett, concerning whose
testimony there appeared to be some con
tention among the attorneys. . -
CHARGES DISMISSED
Inspectors Dockery and Davis of the
Board of Health Are Cleared by
Their Superiors.
Aa was expected the attorneys em
ployed to prosecute tne charges against
Inspectors Dockery and Davis, who are
accused of conspiring to blackmail dairy
men, did not appear at a special meeting
of the Board of Health, which was called
yesterday to hear the matter.
At a meeting hold recently Dr. Morse
moved that the charges be dismissed, be
cause they were "incoherent and vague,'*
but such action was postponed on the
strenuous objection of Attorneys E3tee
and Rothchild.
The attorneys mentioned apparently
anticipate! that the boaru would white
wash the inspectors, for they filed a com
plaint embodying tte original charges, in
the Superior Court, asking that Dockery
be ousted from his office. As neither
Messrs Estee nor Rothchild appeared
yesterday the board dismissed the charges
summarily.
DEFEAT FOR A. M. DAVIS.
Dnpont-Street Bonrt Suit Drc'.ded in
Favor of the City.
The Supreme Court has affirmed the
judgment from which Andrew M. Davi3
appealed in his suit against the City and
County of San Francisco. The action was
to recover from the City and Couniy, un
der the provisions of section 3819 of the
Political Code, certain al.eged taxes
averred to have been paid by appellant
under protest.
Concerning this claim the court says, in
the opinion which was handed down yes
terday by Justice McFarland, Justices
Henshaw and Temple concurring:
"But the alleged taxes were, in fact,
founded upon special assessments for a
specific purpose under an act of the Legis
lature approved March 23, 1876, generally
known as 'the Dupont - street act,' to
which the said section 3819 of the Political
Code does not apply, and for which no
action can be maintained against said City
and County.
"This was expressly decided by this
court in EasterDrook'ys. the City and
County of San Francisco, and upon the
authority of tiiat case the judgment in the
case at bar must be affirmed. It is proper
to state that the Easterbrook case had not
been decided when this appeal was taken
or when tbe briefs in this case weie filed."

TAMPERING WITH
COURT WITNESSES
Serious Charge Against
Ramon Montenegro, a
Gambler.
Contempt Proceedings Instituted
in Judge Joachimsen's
Court.
An Incident in the Case of Rout in
Which Montenegro ani G. A.
Smita Are Defendants.
For the first time in the history of
police courts a charge of rout, which in
legal phraseology is an "unexecuted riot, "
against two gamblers, Ramon Montenegro
and G. A. Smith, came up for hearing he
fore Judge Joachiniseu yesterday after
noon.
The case for the prosecution is in effect
that Montenegro and Smith on August
29 went :o A. E. Cunnington and Ed Kihl,
two waiters, and offered them $5 each to
go to the Cafp Royal. Fourth and Market
street, that nigtii. They were to join in a
game of poker, and during the progress of
t tie game were to quarrel with the other
players, kick over tho table, fire off a
pistol and raise a general disturbance, so
as to bring the Cafe Royal into disrepute.
Cunnington and Kihl, after considering
the matter, decided not to engage in the
conspiracy. They went, however, to the
place ihnt night, but meiely walked
through it.
Montenegro and Smith then got George
Field and another man to do the work.
They went to the Cafe Royal the follow
ing night, Aucust3o, and carried out their
instructions to the letter. Field was ar
rested for carrying a concealed weapon,
and on September 28 was sentenced to pay
a fine ot $50 or t-pend fifty days in the
County Jail. He pot out on an appeal
| without giving bonds, but was arrested by |
: Detectives Dillon and Crockett and has
j since served his time.
The lad* enme to the knowledge of the
! proprietor of the Cafe Royal, who con
i suited Prosecuting Attorney Dare, and
j the result was the arrest of Montenegro
and Smith on the charge of rout.
The defendants had demanded a jury
trial and yesterday afternoon the jurors
i were In court. Cunnington was present
i but Kihl failed to put in an aopearunce.
Prosecuting Attorney Dare and Attorney
Ach, who appeared in the case 'or the
prosecution, got certain information from
Cunninjjton and he was promptly placed
on the witness-stand.
He testified that Montenegro bad come
to him and offered him $2 .jOand a railroad
i ticket to take him into the country, but
jhe httd refused to take either. He sup-
I posed that Kihl had been approached in
I the same way and that was why he was
not present in conn.
Prosecuting Attorney Dare contended
! that if the statement of Cunnington were
I true, and there was no reason to doubt it,
i Montenegro had been guilty of contempt
| of court, if not a felony, in tampering
with witnesses for the prosecution and he
j asked that the Judge should take cog
nizance of the fact and make a full inves
tigation.
The Ju'ige ordered Montenegro to ap
pear b<?fore him Monday afternoon to
show cause why he should not be com
mitted for contempt.
The rout ca^es were by consent con
tinued till December 9, when a new jury
will be impaneled.
BIRDS WILL CARRY NEWS.
Berkeley Wilt Hear of the Plays
While the Big Game Pro
|WMli
Manaenr Reinhardt of the football
eleven of the University of California has
hit on a bright and novel idea in conjunc
tion with A. Carlisle to send over tho de
tails concerning the football game
Thanksgiving day to Berkeley for the
benefit of such members of the university
faculty as may remain at home, so that
they may know of the progress of the con
test. To bring this about Mr. Carlisle of
fered to supply a sufficient number of
birds to cive a complete service, and Mr.
Reinhardt saw the advantage of it at
once. This will probably be the first time
in history that birds have been called into
ase to help report a football game.
